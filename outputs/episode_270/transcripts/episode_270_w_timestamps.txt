[257.72s] the way up you know what you want and
[259.28s] you know why you want it Disney just
[261.16s] made a marginal new low oh cuz they
[264.16s] don&#39;t know what they own makes
[265.639s] absolutely no difference if you know
[267.0s] what you own you don&#39;t know what you own
[269.36s] just don&#39;t dump it in the hole many
[270.8s] people are shaking out of great stocks
[273.6s] due to bad headlines because they don&#39;t
[276.16s] know what they own burden yourself with
[277.96s] the facts just be burdened by the facts
[280.24s] and the data then I burden myself with
[281.96s] the facts separate the facts from the
[285.479s] perception of the facts Mr Market
[288.6s] despondency uh for accumulation and Mr
[291.28s] Market Euphoria for distribution that is
[294.08s] that&#39;s our model right there it&#39;s not
[295.479s] rocket science that&#39;s that&#39;s all we do
[297.56s] and that gets that desponding if you&#39;re
[299.039s] not in buying find another business
[301.039s] despondency turns to Euphoria if they
[303.08s] still have a job at the exact wrong time
[306.72s] price is what you pay value is what
[307.84s] you&#39;re going to get the key is price is
[309.56s] what you pay values what you get price
[311.199s] is what you pay values what you get
[313.199s] price is what you pay values what you&#39;re
[314.639s] going to get as I always talk about
[316.08s] price is what you pay value is what you
[317.8s] get get price is what you pay value is
[320.8s] what you get uh with that said want to
[323.0s] thank everyone for tuning in we&#39;ll be
[324.4s] back next week have a great one bye for
[327.08s] now
[333.12s] and we&#39;re back and then on to the media
[337.319s] I had the pleasure to join the great
[340.039s] Stewart Varney on Friday where we talked
[343.759s] vfc PayPal and some interesting Market
[347.12s] stuff uh so we&#39;re I want to thank
[350.199s] Christian dagger and Preston miselle for
[352.56s] having me on as well as Stuart vanney of
[354.639s] course we&#39;re going to listen in now much
[356.36s] more than that but now we&#39;re up 110
[358.039s] points about a half percentage points
[360.16s] Thomas uh Tom Hayes joins us this
[362.12s] morning uh to cover the markets for us
[364.28s] Tom it looks like we&#39;re going to get a
[366.08s] corporate tax cut and with any luck
[368.28s] we&#39;ll get a corporate tax cut if we get
[370.24s] it what kind of gain would that imply
[373.12s] for the stock
[374.68s] market well steu if the corporate tax
[377.039s] rate comes down from 21% to 15% it would
[380.8s] increase S&amp;P 500 earnings by 4% meaning
[384.72s] estimates for next year would go from
[386.8s] 275 to 286 which is a big deal the
[390.52s] sectors that would have the greatest
[392.0s] benefit is consumer discretionary
[393.68s] earnings would go up
[395.479s] 6.8% Health Care would go up 4.3%
[398.639s] Industrials would go up
[400.36s] 4.3% why this is important is we&#39;re
[402.84s] going to see a broadening in
[405.16s] participation the 493 are going to do
[407.84s] well correlations of stocks are at a
[411.72s] 23-year low it&#39;s going to be a stock
[414.199s] Pickers Market in 2025 still I don&#39;t
[416.96s] understand that the correlation of
[418.199s] stocks is at a multi-year low explain
[421.4s] that so we went through a period of time
[423.96s] when it was risk on risk off the market
[425.8s] went up everything went up the market
[427.44s] went down everything went down so you
[429.759s] were rewarded for just owning the
[431.8s] indices next year with correlations so
[434.599s] low the UNM magnificent 493 there are
[437.879s] going to be pockets of opportunity even
[440.24s] if the indices are up 8 10 12% more
[443.56s] subdued than this year those companies
[446.28s] like in consumer discretionary like in
[448.44s] healthcare like indust that didn&#39;t do
[450.68s] quite as well are now going to start to
[452.44s] participate because not everything is
[454.44s] going to move up and down in the exact
[456.28s] same way even if tech is more subdued
[458.599s] you can find opportunities in
[460.0s] Industrials Healthcare and so on we want
[462.0s] you to do a Victory lap on two stocks
[464.039s] that you brought to us first off VF
[466.52s] Corporation you brought it to us at 15
[469.84s] where is it now and where do you think
[471.72s] it&#39;s
[472.919s] going it&#39;s at 21 now uh it&#39;s up about
[476.759s] 40% since we brought it to the network
[479.8s] and the whole story here Sue is the new
[482.44s] CEO Brack and Daryl has turned this
[485.159s] company around he sold Supreme he
[487.599s] delevered the balance sheet got $1.5
[490.0s] billion of cash they&#39;re doing a
[492.56s] collaboration Northface with skims with
[495.159s] Kim Kardashian it&#39;s off the charts Vans
[497.72s] is turning around this stock is going to
[499.36s] double over the next two years and then
[501.36s] it could go up from there Brack and
[502.599s] Daryl&#39;s a proven winner had a 35 bagger
[505.759s] at litech uh You&#39; got to deal with
[507.599s] PayPal real fast you got 307 seconds you

[512.399s] where&#39;s it
[513.399s] going it&#39;s up 35% it&#39;s going to push
[516.24s] over 100 then it goes to 150 this is
[518.399s] another bet on the jockey new CEO Alex
[521.68s] Chris came from into it where the stock
[524.12s] had a 35 bagger uh he has generated six
[528.279s] billion of cash flow $6 billion dollar

[547.519s] to see you have a great
[549.839s] weekend and we&#39;re back and then I had a
[553.399s] chance to join Kristen Scher live from
[556.68s] the New York Stock Exchange on Monday
[558.959s] morning and want to thank Jeff
[562.399s] Cohen obviously Kristen Scher and
[565.8s] Melissa Montanas for having me on we
[568.519s] listen in here
[569.88s] all right we are off to the races the
[571.8s] stock market officially open for trade
[573.48s] in one of the final weeks of
[575.92s] 2024 what a run and spin for the major
[578.36s] indexes the S&amp;P up about
[580.36s] 27% I do want to bring in my guest to
[582.6s] talk more about markets Thomas Hayes
[584.72s] chaired managing member at Great Hill
[587.04s] Capital uh Thomas always great to see
[589.0s] you especially as we get set to rep what
[591.279s] has been a very eventful year yeah no
[594.079s] question about it they&#39;re excited down
[595.56s] there and they have every right to be
[597.279s] because I think we&#39;re in the period
[598.959s] Kristen where seasonality is becoming
[601.32s] favorable we just got through tax loss
[603.399s] selling season we saw some weakness
[605.36s] there the last week people were getting
[606.8s] nervous little bit of anxiety about the
[609.2s] FED meeting this week but it looks like
[611.04s] for sure they&#39;re going to be cutting 95%
[613.76s] plus odds of a cut this week so as we
[616.16s] move out of tax law selling season guess
[618.32s] what comes to town I think we&#39;re moving
[620.279s] towards the Santa Claus rally a little
[622.04s] bit of strength into year end despite
[624.04s] having such strength all year long yeah
[625.959s] it has been a lot of strength that we&#39;ve
[627.6s] seen here and expectations I I would say
[629.72s] are pretty high for
[631.64s] 2025 how does that set us up in the
[634.32s] markets yeah I think one of the things
[637.0s] that is critical that&#39;s happening right
[638.92s] now is the global easing cycle we&#39;ve had
[642.079s] 64 fed Cuts so far this year another one
[645.6s] on tap hopefully this week and that is
[648.44s] the most amount of easing that we&#39;ve
[650.32s] seen since 2020 and 2009 so while it
[653.519s] feels toppy those were periods when you
[655.6s] wanted to be a buyer of stocks not a
[657.279s] seller of stocks but I do think it&#39;s
[659.6s] going to be nuanced moving forward as a
[661.519s] matter of fact when we look at
[662.72s] correlations of individual stocks going
[665.44s] back to 2001 correlations are now at the
[668.44s] lowest level and what what that voted
[671.079s] vote well for was not a continuation of
[674.639s] tech which you saw into 2000 but
[676.639s] actually a wide broadening uh in in our
[679.959s] case right now the
[681.92s] unmagnify and what you saw in 2001 to
[684.639s] 2007 small caps started to dramatically
[687.0s] outperform and believe it or not eming
[689.639s] markets which no one is positioned for
[692.04s] no one&#39;s interested in it&#39;s American
[694.12s] exceptionalism no one wants those stocks
[695.68s] but if you go back to Trump one oh they
[698.279s] did quite well interesting so you seem
[700.519s] to be optimistic on Emerging Markets is
[702.32s] that the case Thomas I think I think you
[703.8s] want to have some xus I think you want
[705.8s] have some Emerging Markets I think you
[707.32s] want to have some non- us and I think uh
[709.48s] the US will continue to do fine I think
[711.279s] we have to have a little bit slightly
[712.8s] more subdude expectations you know we&#39;re
[715.36s] not not necessarily going to get 27% two
[718.0s] two years in a row or plus 20 23 years
[719.72s] in a row but I think it&#39;ll be okay uh I
[722.279s] do think you&#39;ll see some moderation in
[725.079s] the heaviest weights in the S&amp;P 500
[727.36s] which will weigh on the indices so 2025
[730.839s] stock Pickers Market if you&#39;re in the
[733.079s] indices you&#39;re going to be okay you&#39;re
[734.68s] not going to be thrown parties but 8 10
[736.639s] 12% you&#39;re happy uh underneath the
[739.639s] surface you can make a tremendous amount
[741.639s] of money in that type of environment
[743.199s] that&#39;s where stock picking fundamental
[744.839s] analysis really come to Bear let&#39;s talk
[746.399s] about some of the sectors um as well as
[748.6s] perhaps some of the stocks on your radar
[750.839s] yeah uh I think it&#39;s time for xbi I know
[753.68s] we&#39;ve been on together I&#39;ve talked about
[754.959s] biotech well they finally come
[756.68s] aggressively off that bottom it&#39;s taken
[758.68s] a couple years to to consolidate the the
[761.56s] uh the losses and now we&#39;re at the level
[764.04s] where I think the next phase we&#39;re going
[765.32s] to we&#39;re going to start to to move
[766.68s] higher I think you&#39;ve got two things
[768.279s] working in favor uh deals and drugs so
[771.24s] deals FTC is going to be much more
[773.44s] favorable with mergers and acquisition
[775.92s] and drugs FDA is going to be putting
[778.199s] things out more aggressively couple that
[780.959s] with the fact that large Pharma has more
[783.44s] cash on the balance sheet than they&#39;ve
[784.76s] had in decades and they have a lot of
[787.16s] drugs coming off a patent so they have
[789.04s] it&#39;s much easier to buy Innovation at
[791.92s] low valuations historically low
[793.44s] valuations in the biotech SE sector then
[795.72s] build it from scratch which takes a lot
[797.199s] of time so we like biotech M what does
[799.72s] this mean for
[801.079s] volatility uh that&#39;s a good question
[803.639s] moving forward look we&#39;re at very
[805.36s] compressed volatility right now uh
[807.6s] historically what you see is strength
[809.44s] into an inauguration and then afterwards
[811.6s] it gets a little choppy so it wouldn&#39;t
[813.8s] shock me if we got a little bit of
[815.959s] volatility late January early February
[819.04s] normal pullbacks 5 10% type of pullbacks
[822.0s] uh and then a modestly good year for the
[823.959s] overall indices next year interesting
[826.0s] and in terms of the new administration
[827.639s] of course we saw the president elect
[829.68s] here at the stock exchange on Thursday
[831.519s] as well as many different members of his
[834.0s] cabinet how is that shaping your
[835.88s] investment thesis Thomas you know it&#39;s
[838.12s] it&#39;s Pro business
[839.6s] it&#39;s uh let Animal Spirits run it&#39;s uh
[842.959s] deregulation this is a very positive
[845.12s] thing uh we want to be in those
[847.079s] companies that have actually been beaten
[848.48s] down you know one of the companies we
[850.12s] like which you can&#39;t give it away right
[851.839s] now is called VF Corp okay Brack and
[854.279s] Daryl is the new CEO for the last year
[856.68s] he came from Logitech at Logitech he
[859.16s] took a stock that was down 82% and
[861.6s] created a 25 bagger in 8 years he&#39;s
[863.759s] doing the exact same thing he&#39;s taking
[865.36s] solvency risk off the table by selling
[867.279s] Supreme paying that 1.5 billion dollars
[869.6s] of debt he&#39;s got the new collaboration
[871.519s] with Kim Kardashian North Face and skims
[873.68s] that&#39;s going Vans is stabilizing
[875.839s] Timberland is a solid brand and Dickies
[877.56s] will do okay so we definitely are
[879.48s] betting on Brack and Daryl here is
[881.24s] Bitcoin on your radar uh it&#39;s not I&#39;m an
[883.44s] equity manager uh Kudos are a lot of
[885.8s] ways to make money for me that&#39;s not one
[887.399s] of them but uh I&#39;ve got a lot of friends
[889.279s] that have done extremely well in the
[890.92s] crypto space very quickly in just about
[892.759s] 20 seconds Thomas anything you want to
[894.8s] hear in particular that will shape your
[896.959s] thesis from the FED chare on Wednesday
[899.959s] you know it it wouldn&#39;t number one I
[902.839s] think he&#39;s got to acknowledge that he&#39;s
[904.72s] still in an aggressively restrictive
[906.639s] stance number one and number two it
[908.8s] really wouldn&#39;t surprise me if he does
[910.44s] pause for a while and I and I hope the
[912.399s] Mark I I think the market is prepared
[914.32s] for that get that that cut in he front
[916.48s] loaded a lot of cuts and then maybe see
[918.6s] what happens for the next few months
[919.92s] before you get too aggressively let&#39;s
[921.32s] watch the inflation numbers uh but I
[923.519s] think maybe one maybe two cuts may be
[926.16s] all that&#39;s needed in 2025 after this all
[928.72s] right Thomas Hayes chair and managing
[930.36s] member of great Hill Capital Thomas
[932.24s] always a pleasure thanks so much thanks
[933.759s] for having me
[935.279s] Kristen and we&#39;re back and then I had
[939.639s] the chance on Monday night to join sha
[943.639s] calebs on cgtn America to talk China or
[948.6s] Trump G
[950.6s] relations uh pretty aggressive stance on
[953.639s] a Chinese station but uh I think it&#39;s
[956.8s] moving in the right direction and appre
[958.959s] appreciate sha and Camelia Kellan for
[962.24s] having me on enjoyed speaking with Shawn
[965.16s] as always Los Angeles okay for a deeper
[968.36s] dive into the impact of potential
[970.44s] tariffs from Donald Trump let&#39;s talk
[972.199s] with Thomas Hayes he the founder
[973.839s] chairman and managing member of great
[976.199s] Hill Capital Thomas always a pleasure
[978.48s] good to see you again my friend thank
[980.519s] you for having me Sean okay so How
[982.519s] likely are we to see price hikes on
[985.12s] everyday products and again we are
[987.12s] presuming that this actually goes
[989.12s] through correct I think this is a
[991.36s] negotiating tactic Sean as we saw from
[993.8s] Trump 1.0 people are worried about
[996.6s] inflation the prices of goods going up
[999.0s] except for the fact that inflation under
[1001.04s] Trump 1.0 was 1.9% on average uh right
[1004.88s] now China is running a trade surplus at
[1007.319s] a record high of
[1009.0s] 957 billion and the impact of any
[1012.519s] tariffs if they do go through uh is
[1015.68s] lessened by the fact that the Yuan has
[1018.959s] valued over 5% in the last few months
[1021.319s] against the dollar very similar to what
[1023.72s] happened after the 2016 election before
[1027.48s] the 2017 inauguration so there&#39;s a lot
[1030.88s] of knee-jerk reactions here Sean it may
[1033.799s] prove to be over overblown particularly
[1037.319s] when you have a president offering one
[1038.959s] of the longest Olive branches in
[1041.72s] diplomatic history to president Xi
[1043.88s] Jinping inviting him to attend the
[1047.079s] inauguration and I would say if
[1048.96s] president G Jinping is serious about
[1051.16s] recovering the Chinese economy he should
[1053.32s] accept that Olive Branch and come and
[1055.44s] negotiate and make a good business deal
[1058.0s] for China make a good business deal for
[1060.32s] America and move forward with economic
[1062.76s] Prosperity Thomas there&#39;s also no
[1064.799s] question that Trump has played hard ball
[1067.16s] not just with China but with Canada and
[1069.2s] Mexico as well and whether or not this
[1071.4s] goes through people are planning on it
[1073.919s] if you look at the amount of goods that
[1075.44s] came through the port in just the last
[1077.52s] month out in Los Angeles this shows that
[1079.559s] people are buying now so what should
[1082.559s] Americans perhaps plan on buying now
[1084.96s] ahead of a tariff
[1087.28s] implementation I think if you make a
[1089.559s] decision an emotional decision based on
[1091.559s] a knee-jerk reaction to headlines I
[1094.44s] think you&#39;re you&#39;re doing yourself a
[1095.72s] disservice because that money could
[1097.08s] compound invested and uh you know if
[1100.28s] you&#39;re not taking it out out of the
[1101.84s] stock market you don&#39;t pay pay taxes so
[1104.799s] uh you know if the worst case scenario
[1107.039s] happened and as it relates to other
[1108.96s] countries other than China and including
[1110.84s] China this is all predominantly about
[1113.44s] fairness and reciprocity so if Canada
[1116.96s] taxes us 10% on X we&#39;re going to tax
[1119.32s] them 10% on y uh Etc so you know phones
[1123.96s] they estimate could go up as much as 26%
[1126.76s] vacuums as much as 19% gaming as much as
[1129.44s] 40% shoes as much as 14% but you have to
[1133.039s] put this in perspective Sean we have the
[1135.84s] lowest percent of Duties collected as a
[1139.28s] percentage of total Imports in over a
[1141.64s] 100 years it&#39;s 3% of Duties on total
[1145.72s] Imports uh if you go all the way back
[1148.84s] first of all this is lower than it was
[1150.52s] under Clinton it&#39;s lower than it was
[1152.6s] under Carter it&#39;s lower than it was
[1154.559s] under JFK not by a little by a lot and
[1158.0s] for all the people worried about hoot uh
[1161.4s] uh Smoot Holly tariffs in 1929 caused
[1164.12s] the Great Depression at the Spanish Flu
[1167.039s] in 1918
[1168.96s] 5% was the total duties collected we&#39;re
[1171.88s] at 3% Now That Grew From 5% to 177%
[1175.96s] before Holly Smoot so 12 years of
[1178.72s] economic Prosperity before it hit a
[1180.76s] crescendo so we have to be careful I
[1183.24s] think this is a a starting point to
[1185.799s] bring people to the table a lot of
[1187.24s] people have come to the table at
[1188.6s] maralago to meet with President Trump uh
[1191.039s] Trudeau came down to to meet the
[1193.44s] president of Mexico called so let&#39;s see
[1195.72s] what gin ping does maybe he will accept
[1197.919s] the invitation we will have a very
[1200.28s] promising uh economically prosperous
[1202.919s] mutually beneficial relationship moving
[1204.76s] forward well but but Trump has also
[1206.32s] followed through with this in the past
[1207.76s] so let&#39;s talk about how tariffs could
[1210.32s] contribute to inflation many Americans
[1212.64s] are just fed up with inflation that
[1214.2s] probably cost the Biden Or democrats uh
[1217.24s] the election if you listen to what
[1218.4s] experts are saying so is Trump using
[1221.28s] this as a threat to Simply get what he
[1223.48s] wants what&#39;s behind this well it&#39;s part
[1226.2s] of it look in Trump 1.0 you had 30 to
[1229.24s] 50% tariffs placed on washing machines
[1231.799s] you had 25% tariffs placed on steel you
[1234.2s] had 10% tariffs placed on aluminum you
[1237.2s] had uh 4% of 4.1% of total tariffs were
[1241.84s] impacted by the tariffs he implemented
[1244.12s] in 2018 and yet the average inflation
[1246.44s] rate was 1.9% during his his term so
[1250.08s] some of this gets offset by currency
[1252.0s] some of it never happens it&#39;s overblown
[1254.4s] but we do have to keep in mind as it
[1256.2s] relates to what he&#39;s negotiating a lot
[1258.919s] of this has to do with border security
[1260.72s] and fentol trafficking he&#39;s saying stop
[1263.4s] the fentanyl or I&#39;m going to tariff you
[1265.679s] yeah but China has but China has
[1267.72s] actually said that they will work with
[1268.96s] the United States on fentanyl that&#39;s one
[1270.52s] thing that they&#39;ve said time and time
[1271.96s] again they they they are starting to do
[1274.08s] that but they have said it and it has
[1275.84s] not been the case in the previous four
[1277.44s] years it is now beginning and that&#39;s a
[1279.559s] positive constructive step that will go
[1281.64s] a long way and probably has something to
[1283.64s] do with the olive branch that was
[1285.48s] extended to attend the inauguration
[1287.08s] which I think president X should take
[1288.279s] him up on it&#39;s going to be interesting
[1290.2s] my friend Thomas thank you so much I
[1291.799s] really appreciate your Insight thanks
[1293.279s] again thank you Sean okay and then on to
[1297.48s] another topic I had the pleasure to join
[1301.0s] Neil the great Neil Cavuto yesterday and
[1303.72s] we covered everything uh from rotation
[1307.679s] to healthc care you want to pay close
[1309.44s] attention to what I say about health
[1311.24s] care and the analogy to 2016
[1314.72s] 2017 and its relative trading
[1317.24s] performance and keeping things simple so
[1321.0s] thanks to Jenna D tomases and the great
[1324.24s] Neil Cavuto for having me on we&#39;ll
[1326.559s] listen in here my favorite guests here
[1328.4s] is a young man he follows us very very
[1330.08s] closely uh Thomas Hayes the chairman and
[1332.64s] managing member of great Hill Capital
[1334.96s] Tom um it was really not meant to be a
[1337.08s] com because everyone is Young compared
[1338.76s] to me but I seriously I I always enjoy
[1340.919s] hearing from you because you give us a
[1342.12s] good perspective on this and I&#39;m
[1343.84s] wondering now if these nine down Dow
[1346.64s] days I I know we in the media can make
[1348.52s] make a big deal of that and there&#39;s no
[1350.64s] connection sometimes to the overall tone
[1352.36s] of the markets but a bit of a relief
[1354.76s] rally today what do you what do you
[1356.159s] think well it&#39;s interesting uh the 50%
[1359.96s] of the 1500 Point drop in the Dow 50%
[1362.84s] was attributable to United Healthcare as
[1365.64s] a matter of matter of fact healthc care
[1368.679s] relative to the S&amp;P 500 is having its
[1372.039s] lowest performance since 2008 that was
[1375.52s] an enormous buying opportunity so
[1377.159s] there&#39;s some and that down Drive United
[1379.08s] Health really was happening before the
[1382.52s] killing of the the CEO but go ahead and
[1384.48s] it&#39;s exacerbated and and of the 500 S&amp;P
[1387.6s] components 62 are Healthcare the average
[1391.0s] Health Care stock those 62 is down
[1393.84s] 19% as Mark Twain used to say the rumors
[1396.48s] of My Demise are greatly exaggerated
[1398.64s] this exact same thing happened in 2016
[1402.08s] after Trump was elected before the
[1404.12s] inauguration remember he was going to
[1405.72s] tear up the Affordable Care Act it
[1408.0s] didn&#39;t happen with John McCain and
[1409.88s] shortly thereafter you saw biotech rally
[1412.559s] 75% the next year Healthcare the XLV
[1415.48s] rallied 40% in the next year so I think
[1417.799s] there&#39;s going to be tremendous
[1419.24s] opportunity to take advantage of
[1420.799s] healthcare and that&#39;s part of this
[1422.96s] rotation that you&#39;re seeing in December
[1425.08s] the other part of it is tax LW selling
[1426.679s] so what&#39;s performed this year growth is
[1428.6s] performed so there&#39;s nothing to sell
[1429.919s] people want to sell those after the
[1431.279s] after the New Year some of the value
[1432.84s] stocks have underperformed so they&#39;re
[1434.279s] selling in the hole to create tax assets
[1436.6s] so let&#39;s play out what we&#39;re looking
[1438.72s] forward to in the next week or two of
[1440.44s] this year it&#39;s been an incredible year
[1442.6s] the Dow last nine days notwithstanding
[1444.76s] still up I think 17 18% year today uh
[1448.039s] can we keep this going in the new year I
[1450.279s] think it&#39;s going to be nuanced I think
[1451.88s] Santa&#39;s going to come to town we&#39;ll see
[1453.279s] a little bit of strength tax LW selling
[1454.84s] is over I don&#39;t know Santa always
[1456.559s] worries because he always wears
[1458.32s] red I that&#39;s a good point watch out not
[1461.279s] a thin color I might the Grinch is green
[1464.159s] uh hopefully there will be no Grinch
[1465.52s] this year uh we do have strong earnings
[1467.799s] but how much that is priced in is a
[1469.399s] great question I think returns next year
[1471.399s] are going to be slightly more subdued 8
[1473.559s] 10 12% for the general indices the other
[1476.52s] thing that we&#39;re say it&#39;s still not bad
[1477.84s] we&#39;re just used to 26 28 30% um you know
[1480.96s] Goldman Sachs is still saying 3% if
[1483.64s] we&#39;re lucky yeah what do you think well
[1485.76s] you know it&#39;s interesting the
[1487.44s] correlations of stocks right now are at
[1489.96s] the lowest level in 24 years going back
[1492.64s] to 20012 2002 uh what that implies is
[1496.76s] that the forign 93 are going to start to
[1500.36s] pick up the slack which means if tech
[1502.24s] does perform more modestly next year
[1504.32s] than it did this year um there there&#39;s
[1507.24s] just tremendous ways to make money under
[1508.96s] the surface so you you have to be I
[1511.399s] think a little cautious if you&#39;re too
[1513.559s] overweight in all the stocks that are
[1515.32s] working uh some of them have become
[1517.279s] really fully valued if not excessively
[1519.52s] valued in some cases you include the
[1521.76s] Magnificent 7 and tech stocks I find it
[1523.72s] always interesting looking at the
[1524.799s] Magnificent 7 even though you get an
[1526.6s] Nvidia that goes into correction ter
[1528.64s] down 10% or more from its high Tesla
[1531.36s] balanced out the rest of the Magnificent
[1533.399s] guys Tesla a little under duress today
[1535.32s] not not much but how do you play that
[1537.44s] out there because there are a lot of
[1538.48s] people who just virtue of the the
[1541.0s] strength of those stock performances are
[1543.679s] disproportionally now in Tech a lot yeah
[1546.6s] what do you tell them uh I think you
[1548.24s] want to look for simpler stocks in 2025
[1551.6s] for example Boeing is turning around
[1554.0s] okay new CEO is turning around the ship
[1556.6s] the union problems are solved the 737 is
[1559.44s] back online that start stock is starting
[1561.159s] to take off no one&#39;s even talking about
[1563.12s] it it&#39;s up pretty meaningfully in the
[1564.679s] last couple weeks we still have those
[1565.919s] astronaut stream I mean but that Wall
[1568.64s] Street doesn&#39;t seem to care but you know
[1572.24s] let&#39;s face it up Boeing still has a
[1573.88s] whole heap of problems here but I guess
[1575.64s] is the sentiment here that it it was
[1577.64s] over beaten and is this a genuine
[1580.0s] turnaround no question about it look
[1581.96s] they have a 10year half a trillion
[1584.039s] dollar backlog the beauty is it&#39;s a
[1586.039s] duopoly if you want a plane you can only
[1588.08s] get from Boeing or you can get it from
[1589.64s] airb and if you say I don&#39;t like Boeing
[1591.799s] they were a disaster well then you got
[1593.36s] to wait 20 years from airb so they&#39;re
[1595.36s] going to fix it uh Kelly ortberg at
[1598.159s] Rockwell Collins he created a four
[1599.96s] bagger in six years for his shareholders
[1602.679s] so he&#39;s going to turn that around he&#39;s
[1604.12s] going to write the ship another simple
[1605.88s] one is Disney that&#39;s still down 50% you
[1608.36s] can&#39;t give the stock away uh it&#39;s
[1610.2s] starting to recover in the last few
[1611.679s] months again how do you play that you
[1613.76s] know because I&#39;ve asked this before but
[1615.64s] you know there&#39;s that play the dogs of
[1617.679s] the Dow for for example and and they&#39;ll
[1619.32s] have their day um but sometimes the dogs
[1621.72s] could still bark for a while before or
[1623.88s] you can get foolishly drawn in and
[1625.76s] realize oh wait a minute there&#39;s no here
[1627.36s] here yeah I think the key is low to no
[1630.679s] leverage that&#39;s where people really get
[1632.279s] hurt is if they buy too much on Leverage
[1634.559s] just buy the position and know that
[1637.159s] overtime good quality businesses always
[1639.52s] recover the number one thing so that
[1640.96s] extends to Disney that that extends does
[1643.88s] it extend to the borrowers who who want
[1646.159s] to go in and buy some of these stocks
[1647.919s] then are they cuz some of them are
[1649.279s] borrowing on Leverage of their own
[1650.72s] margin accounts of yeah I think that&#39;s a
[1652.679s] way to get yourself stopped out and
[1654.279s] nervous too soon with good quality
[1655.84s] businesses you you know good things come
[1657.279s] to those who wait some come faster the
[1659.399s] name of the game with a turnaround
[1660.72s] situation when it&#39;s a quality durable
[1662.64s] business that&#39;s been around for decades
[1664.2s] and you know it&#39;s going to be around for
[1665.399s] decades to come uh is just solvency risk
[1668.44s] if there&#39;s no solvency risk which Boeing
[1670.279s] had a little bit of people were a little
[1671.88s] bit worried but they raised $20 billion
[1673.44s] of cash they&#39;re going to be fine uh and
[1675.399s] Disney now is cash flow positive on the
[1677.159s] streaming side of the business
[1678.679s] in those just wait and they will start
[1680.679s] to recover over the next couple years
[1682.2s] you&#39;ll be very happy you don&#39;t have to
[1683.519s] guess the future you don&#39;t have to guess
[1685.24s] who&#39;s going to win the AI game you just
[1686.76s] say it&#39;s Disney everyone loves Disney
[1688.919s] it&#39;s Boeing everyone loves to fly it&#39;s
[1690.799s] going to recover the stocks are down
[1692.32s] materially from the covid highs they&#39;re
[1694.2s] going to come back but the rally
[1695.2s] continues in in in aggregate just not as
[1697.679s] crazy as we see I think the index
[1699.399s] holders will be underwhelmed and I think
[1702.08s] there&#39;s going to be great opportunities
[1703.36s] under the surface as this continues to
[1705.2s] brought remember other than the last 10
[1707.08s] days we saw real change real broadening
[1709.64s] since the summer abut this is a pause
[1712.12s] that&#39;s going to refresh and I think
[1714.12s] we&#39;re going to see that 493 and a lot of
[1715.76s] the money is going to be made in names
[1717.08s] we haven&#39;t been talking about this year
[1718.919s] and that&#39;s what I&#39;m 493 the other S&amp;P
[1721.0s] 500 stocks not just those the other
[1723.519s] thing is um in Trump 1.0 everyone was
[1726.399s] worried about xus so no you can&#39;t give
[1728.96s] away an international stock right now
[1730.399s] whether it&#39;s Emerging Markets Europe I
[1732.2s] think there&#39;s some value there I think
[1733.399s] you want to start to get some allocation
[1735.24s] you don&#39;t have to go crazy but I do
[1737.24s] think uh what saw in his first year they
[1739.919s] outperformed so so that could be a
[1742.2s] surprise for 2025 Neil yeah these Global
[1744.6s] ETFs are already percolating so we&#39;ll
[1746.6s] watch what happens uh Tom good see you
[1748.44s] have a merry Christmas we don&#39;t chat
[1749.919s] again Thomas Hayes follows us very very
[1752.0s] well uh when it comes
[1753.64s] to and we&#39;re
[1756.76s] back and then I had the pleasure to
[1761.12s] join Stuart vanney once again on Tuesday
[1765.88s] with regard to uh Etsy and a couple
[1769.919s] other retail sales automobile sales you
[1772.72s] definitely want to check this out we&#39;re
[1774.44s] going to tune in here I want to get back
[1776.799s] to the retail sales numbers we received
[1778.84s] earlier up in the last uh 12 months up
[1782.48s] 3.8% Thomas Hayes joins me Hayes no n
[1786.08s] Hayes joins me now uh I thought the
[1788.559s] consumer was strapped but we got a
[1790.48s] strong sales report here what&#39;s going on
[1792.48s] well Stuart the one thing I&#39;ve learned
[1793.64s] in this business over the years is never
[1795.399s] bet against the US consumer when they
[1797.08s] have a job they like to spend what
[1799.159s] you&#39;ve seen since the election consumer
[1801.039s] sentiment has come up consumer
[1803.44s] confidence has come up uh Debt Service
[1806.32s] as a percentage of disposable income is
[1808.88s] still below prean pre pandemic levels
[1812.039s] and at multi-decade lows so the consumer
[1814.2s] is strong they&#39;re going to continue to
[1815.679s] be strong and not only are they buying
[1817.159s] trinkets now they&#39;re buying automobiles
[1819.399s] because the incentives are going up
[1821.0s] would you agree with the following the
[1822.559s] top 20% of income earners are doing just
[1825.44s] fine y Middle America on the edge
[1828.519s] struggling a little lower inome people
[1831.24s] really in trouble that&#39;s right uh we&#39;re
[1833.36s] seeing it a little bit in the dollar
[1834.679s] store stocks and their earnings results
[1837.279s] Etc Walmart has brought down some of the
[1839.559s] the middle inome people to spend in
[1841.24s] their stores so Walmart&#39;s still doing
[1842.64s] well but Dollar General Dollar Tree have
[1844.36s] struggled a little bit but I think it&#39;s
[1846.12s] going to get better as that sentiment
[1847.399s] comes back the jobs stay healthy and uh
[1849.72s] and Trump helps that was the demographic
[1851.72s] that did really well under Trump 1.0 so
[1854.84s] stay tuned okay we&#39;re looking at 2025
[1858.279s] look across the spectrum of all the
[1860.0s] stocks that you follow and all the
[1861.24s] stocks that you like give me one that
[1863.44s] you think is going to do really really
[1865.0s] well in 2025 what is it you&#39;re asking me
[1867.32s] for my favorite child but uh I&#39;ll give
[1869.44s] you one uh it&#39;s called Etsy this was a
[1872.24s] covid darling the stock is down 80% it&#39;s
[1875.399s] the fourth most trafficked e-commerce
[1878.159s] site behind Amazon eBay and Walmart most
[1881.0s] people don&#39;t know that you can only get
[1882.84s] things on etay that that you can&#39;t get
[1884.799s] anywhere else so it&#39;s not a race to the
[1886.24s] bottom they&#39;re still generating over
[1887.919s] over $600 million of free cash flow and
[1890.279s] that&#39;s starting to re accelerate they
[1892.2s] just announced a$1 billion buyback
[1894.24s] they&#39;ve got loyalty programs gifting
[1895.88s] programs they&#39;re focused on
[1896.96s] International growth and bringing men
[1899.279s] into the fold so if you want to do the
[1901.12s] minimum just scattershot everyone
[1902.72s] chocolates that they&#39;re never going to
[1903.76s] eat for Christmas if you want to make
[1905.32s] them feel special get them something on
[1907.159s] eBay with their name on it they&#39;ll never
[1908.84s] forget that gift and that&#39;s why we like
[1910.679s] eBay you could move the market with that
[1912.44s] Rec that was very strong young man very
[1914.76s] strong Tom Hayes thanks for being with
[1916.039s] us appreciate than for having me uh
[1919.88s] and we&#39;re back again thanks to Christian
[1921.799s] dagger and to Preston misel and Stuart
[1924.72s] vanney for having me on and then finally
[1927.0s] want to
[1928.12s] thank Aria Singh Baja for including me
[1931.919s] in her article on Reuters on Friday so
[1935.08s] it&#39;s been a busy week and what&#39;s
[1937.559s] important is despite what happened
[1939.48s] yesterday everything that we covered in
[1942.36s] those videos which covers my total
[1944.519s] comprehensive Outlook right now um
[1948.12s] applies okay and we&#39;re going to talk
[1949.88s] about yesterday&#39;s flush and um how we&#39;re
[1954.039s] thinking about things moving forward
[1955.559s] it&#39;ll be a little bumpy ride when you
[1957.039s] get that type of a uh push down but you
[1959.96s] know we we try to just burden ourselves
[1962.44s] with the facts be dispassionate about
[1964.639s] things and uh pick our spots looking at
[1967.919s] some of these charts these are some of
[1970.36s] the indicators we&#39;re going to cover more
[1971.639s] in the article of the week you look at
[1973.48s] pmo buy all it&#39;s not quite down to zero
[1976.159s] so we could have a little bit more pain
[1978.279s] uh pmo by SPX is closer to areas where
[1981.12s] you see recoveries obviously active
[1983.72s] managers got over their skis all in the
[1985.88s] same stocks those got hit the hardest
[1987.88s] yesterday uh the put call did Spike up
[1990.399s] to levels where you usually see a little
[1992.0s] bit of a back off uh it wouldn&#39;t
[1994.24s] surprise me to see another foe flush
[1997.48s] just to get out all the weak hands
[1999.0s] before we bounce back uh but on balance
[2002.519s] I think we want to uh remain invested
[2005.96s] through the inauguration
[2008.039s] and we used the opportunity late
[2010.279s] yesterday and in after hours to buy some
[2012.6s] things up at uh at some nice prices and
[2015.919s] that doesn&#39;t mean we got the last tick
[2017.399s] it just means we took advantage the
[2019.159s] other thing that I would say is going
[2021.639s] back to the Trump trade these are the
[2024.96s] charts from 2016 from when he got
[2027.6s] elected uh uh to when he got inaugurated
[2031.12s] and I just want to remind you on a few
[2032.919s] of these key obviously Emerging Markets
[2035.639s] got hit the hardest after he got elected
[2038.519s] uh all the way through the calendar year
[2040.32s] before the inauguration and then they
[2042.12s] shot straight up we&#39;re looking at Baba
[2044.12s] here but it&#39;s a proxy for emerging
[2045.559s] markets down after the election into the
[2048.839s] calendar year right before the
[2049.96s] inauguration straight up uh more than a
[2052.8s] double in less than 12 months uh same
[2056.28s] with
[2059.44s] um kweb is the same same type of
[2062.28s] situation that&#39;s Chinese internet which
[2064.159s] is basically Baba you also saw a little
[2066.8s] bit of um
[2068.599s] checkback with the equal weight which is
[2070.96s] a kind of proxy for the Magnificent
[2073.72s] 493 and small caps even semiconductors
[2077.44s] saw a little bumpiness in December
[2079.159s] before the inauguration and so on so
[2082.159s] this is stuff that we&#39;ve seen before
[2083.96s] solar stocks we continue to like keep
[2086.04s] our open mind because they did much
[2087.76s] better under Trump than they did under
[2089.919s] uh Biden which is counterintuitive
[2092.04s] biotech was like the wild west after he
[2094.8s] got elected sold off after the
[2097.04s] inauguration straight up we&#39;re going to
[2098.72s] cover that uh energy stocks back then
[2102.0s] went straight up after he got elected
[2103.72s] and then had a bad year the next year
[2105.76s] some of them are getting to points that
[2108.04s] get us interested but for now we
[2110.2s] exclusively are in com stock which is up
[2113.079s] a lot uh but it&#39;s just getting
[2116.72s] started um and let&#39;s take a look at some
[2120.0s] of these others just to remind ourselves
[2123.28s] not to get totally faked out with
[2125.76s] short-term moves because this type of
[2127.839s] volatility same with tech you saw some
[2130.32s] volatility before the inauguration
[2132.32s] Staples sold off big there&#39;s some
[2134.68s] opportuni starting to show up if you
[2136.48s] look at like Pepsi and Coke we haven&#39;t
[2138.64s] done anything there
[2141.16s] but we don&#39;t mind buying high quality
[2143.48s] consumer Brands when they&#39;re on sale so
[2145.359s] we&#39;ll keep our eyes
[2147.2s] peeled utilities if if opportunities
[2149.96s] come up same thing and Healthcare look
[2152.44s] at what happened to healthcare after the
[2155.0s] election remember this was as I
[2157.64s] discussed with Neil Cavuto this was the
[2159.96s] period he was going to rip up the
[2161.0s] Affordable Care Act so right now this is
[2162.76s] the period where you know RFK is going
[2165.079s] to ban all vaccines which he&#39;s told you
[2167.04s] he&#39;s not going to do he&#39;s going to
[2168.76s] spread out the schedule do things in a
[2170.96s] more rational sensible way which 99% of
[2173.68s] people agree with um and uh and the
[2176.88s] other ones are selling it to you so uh
[2178.839s] the 1% so uh this will be fine and this
[2181.839s] is going to be a great opportunity
[2183.48s] you&#39;re seeing it whether it&#39;s the fisers
[2185.56s] of the world the xbis of the world the
[2188.8s] backers of the world every single thing
[2191.64s] the you know the insurers centine Etc uh
[2195.04s] they&#39;re all beaten down they&#39;re going to
[2196.96s] they&#39;re going to it&#39;s like a beach ball
[2199.04s] underwater um and huge opportunity there
[2203.119s] and so on so oh let&#39;s just quickly
[2206.599s] remind you because everyone&#39;s probably
[2208.92s] getting sideways about this short-term
[2212.0s] offsides on us treasuries and the dollar
[2220.119s] so if you look at he was elected in
[2224.76s] November early November TLT collapsed
[2228.64s] from 108 to 95 absolutely Co collapsed
[2234.079s] and then he got inaugurated it started
[2236.16s] to Rally into the inauguration bottomed
[2238.44s] out two months later in March and then
[2240.04s] started to move straight up over the
[2241.359s] next couple of years so um so for those
[2244.24s] of you worried about bond yields
[2245.92s] compressing it&#39;s this is
[2248.24s] par for the course sell off before after
[2251.359s] the election
[2252.8s] buy into the inauguration and it will
[2255.48s] continue to persist up and yields will
[2257.119s] will compress similar with the US dollar
[2260.28s] for those getting faked out today and
[2262.56s] think that everything&#39;s
[2264.079s] sideways uh same exact thing he got
[2266.599s] elected the dollar went straight up
[2268.48s] until the calendar turned uh couldn&#39;t go
[2271.04s] any higher and then completely rolled
[2272.96s] over the next year and that&#39;s why you
[2274.88s] saw emerging markets do what it did now
[2278.359s] the P the charts that we&#39;re going to
[2279.8s] cover this week we&#39;ve got a lot of them
[2282.359s] uh a lot of them are probably going to
[2283.96s] be duplicates because I was doing this
[2285.4s] on the 6-hour plane ride back to
[2287.68s] California and the internet was so so it
[2291.079s] was good enough to get the article done
[2292.52s] which I think was a pretty good and
[2294.2s] timely article we put that out at like
[2296.0s] 9:00 last night when Futures were still
[2298.56s] down uh N9 I don&#39;t know if it was pfic I
[2302.24s] the time kept changing when we were in
[2303.8s] the air but long story short we got it
[2305.76s] done uh and that was pretty timely and a
[2308.96s] pretty unconventional view when we put
[2310.359s] it out
[2312.68s] um okay so this is Bank Ling we can skip
[2315.96s] that this is S&amp;P 500 Advanced decline
[2320.24s] percent as you can see here it got
[2322.839s] completely flushed towards levels that
[2325.599s] you see near bottoms and bounces so that
[2329.119s] also bodess well we covered a lot of our
[2331.2s] own in the article of the
[2333.76s] week here is the mlen oscillator again
[2337.48s] these are areas that you get bounces not
[2340.8s] uh you can go further but um the risk
[2343.48s] reward starts to get interesting then
[2346.079s] you have the health care sector this is
[2348.16s] going to be the most important chart
[2350.24s] that we cover this week the lowest
[2352.76s] relative performance of healthc care to
[2355.4s] the S&amp;P since the 2008
[2359.44s] lows uh so that is uh and that was a
[2363.28s] generational buy opportunity we&#39;ll talk
[2364.88s] about that this is election year
[2368.04s] seasonal composite so what did we see
[2371.119s] here we
[2373.2s] got some
[2376.0s] uh move higher early December some hard
[2380.04s] chop in the middle of December and then
[2382.319s] after the 21st straight up Santa comes
[2384.8s] to town it wouldn&#39;t shock me if that it
[2387.599s] if that turns out to be correct uh so
[2390.8s] let&#39;s see if this if this holds this is
[2392.839s] since 1928 this normal mid December uh
[2397.52s] chop is pretty pretty darn normal until
[2399.52s] the 21st so we&#39;re at the 19th so maybe
[2402.24s] tomorrow&#39;s week again and Monday uh mix
[2405.56s] and then maybe we get a little
[2406.52s] turnaround Tuesday action reason this
[2409.16s] chart keeps repeating is I think there
[2410.52s] was an accidentally a header uh put into
[2414.24s] the mix when
[2416.88s] um when I was putting this all together
[2419.24s] so we&#39;ll just ignore it uh Bull and Bear
[2421.76s] indicator is not at an extreme so we you
[2424.72s] know keep it in mind this is from
[2426.52s] heartnet
[2428.319s] uh the contrarian view The Price is
[2432.52s] Right uh oh he&#39;s talking about eight
[2434.599s] shares out perform the S&amp;P in
[2436.72s] 2024 you China Trade Surplus just hit a
[2439.64s] record high at 957 billion China share
[2442.68s] of global car production up 1% to almost
[2445.079s] 40% the past 20
[2447.319s] years
[2451.72s] uh okay so his point here
[2455.44s] is Trump wants growth not inflation and
[2459.16s] if consensus too fearful of q1 tariffs
[2462.04s] China stock set to outperform more entry
[2464.079s] point for international inq1 so har
[2466.28s] Net&#39;s making a big call it&#39;s time to buy
[2467.96s] China stocks uh China Financial
[2470.44s] conditions are the easiest since June of
[2473.72s] 20 that was right after the covid lows
[2476.24s] we know the big rally we got into
[2478.4s] 2022 and when when was the last time
[2481.319s] that China conditions and people don&#39;t
[2483.0s] realize how how easy conditions are in
[2485.64s] China because it feels like there&#39;s a
[2487.0s] new headline every day they cut this
[2489.04s] ratio they cut this interest rate they
[2491.319s] do this half stimulus and they do all
[2493.52s] this stuff but it&#39;s adding up ladies and
[2495.72s] gentlemen and it&#39;s adding up to the
[2497.079s] point where you get massive rallies
[2499.839s] let&#39;s just take a look at the last three
[2502.359s] times that Financial conditions were
[2504.92s] this easy in China what happened so uh
[2508.0s] May 2020 and all I really care about is
[2511.52s] Baba so let&#39;s just do
[2513.28s] that um
[2518.64s] okay so you had May
[2520.079s] 2020 uh that shot up
[2523.319s] the from 190 to 312 in less than a year
[2528.64s] and then prior to that the last time
[2531.68s] Financial conditions were that easy was
[2533.56s] November
[2536.16s] 2016 that&#39;s right here ladies and
[2538.16s] gentlemen which by the way this is the
[2541.2s] analog that we&#39;ve been using here let me
[2543.319s] just show you for the new
[2544.92s] listeners um this is really interesting
[2547.76s] how a lot of these things are linking
[2549.359s] together doesn&#39;t mean they&#39;ll work
[2550.96s] perfectly but it does mean that history
[2554.359s] does tend to rhyme take a look
[2559.16s] here okay so November 2016 is right here
[2563.599s] that is the last time you had Financial
[2565.72s] conditions this easy we covered May 20th
[2568.079s] so that was like a huge move 100 points
[2570.16s] in in less than a year but going back
[2573.4s] here it&#39;s interesting you&#39;re seeing the
[2575.119s] conditions exactly the same thing you
[2576.559s] have this break and then this lower low
[2579.16s] and November 16 is when Trump got
[2581.48s] elected so like right now you had Bob is
[2585.72s] starting to get uh recovered then Trump
[2588.04s] got elected you were down for a few
[2589.64s] months down for a few months and then at
[2592.319s] the turn of the thing so straight up
[2595.559s] from 855 to 200 and change in just about
[2599.64s] a exactly a year 85 to 20 84 to
[2604.88s] 207 uh and it&#39;s very interesting because
[2607.72s] Bob is recovering off these lows just
[2609.559s] like it was Trump gets elected 3 months
[2612.319s] down we&#39;re in the third month down and
[2614.96s] then straight up for 12 months so
[2617.24s] doesn&#39;t have to repeat but conditions
[2618.76s] are very similar and now that you can
[2620.52s] see it empirically that Financial
[2623.079s] conditions
[2624.76s] uh this is uh average of percentile
[2628.28s] ranks of China 10year government bond
[2630.359s] yield R&amp;B and oil price since 2010 and
[2634.319s] when you get to that and then let&#39;s go
[2636.0s] back to 200 10 you can&#39;t see Alibaba
[2639.76s] wasn&#39;t there but let&#39;s just see uh hang
[2647.52s] sang going back to that so you can just
[2650.319s] see that this is a
[2652.72s] regular
[2654.92s] occurrence 2010 so you you had some
[2657.8s] strength there as well so here&#39;s 2016
[2660.359s] straight up and now here we are in
[2663.079s] December of 2024
[2667.4s] and uh maybe the other one wasn&#39;t the
[2669.48s] most important chart this is probably
[2670.839s] the most important chart that we&#39;re
[2671.88s] going to cover until we get to the next
[2673.64s] most important chart China T China Trade
[2675.72s] Surplus at record high 957
[2678.2s] billion uh then we&#39;ve got China equities
[2681.28s] the biggest inflow in nine weeks that
[2683.359s] was from last week so you got that and
[2686.72s] then S&amp;P is skewed by expensive Mega
[2689.4s] caps the average stock trades near a
[2691.68s] record discount to the index greater
[2694.52s] than one standard deviation below
[2696.76s] average average that is a big deal
[2698.76s] ladies and gentlemen and when&#39;s the last
[2700.16s] time we saw that our favorite year 20012
[2703.119s] 2002 which set the stage for emerging
[2705.72s] markets and international to outperform
[2707.559s] along with small caps uh gap between
[2710.04s] cheap and expensive stocks is wide I
[2712.839s] mean this extreme is becoming severe and
[2716.28s] um
[2718.0s] if AI is going to be as great as
[2722.04s] everyone is expecting it&#39;s just going to
[2724.44s] take longer like it always does just
[2726.319s] like Amazon
[2727.52s] is as great as everyone was expeced from
[2729.599s] 95 to to 2000 except it dropped 90%
[2734.0s] before over the next 15 years it became
[2736.72s] as great as everyone expected and the
[2738.28s] same thing&#39;s going to happen with a lot
[2739.52s] of these AI stocks and everything else
[2741.839s] uh value trades at a discount PE so
[2745.4s] again you got to go back to 20012 2002
[2747.48s] this is just setting up perfectly same
[2749.68s] on Price to Book same on price to sales
[2752.119s] it&#39;s all there ladies and gentlemen and
[2753.839s] if you don&#39;t take advantage of
[2755.92s] aberrational periods like this and load
[2758.119s] the boat uh and by the way you should do
[2760.64s] whatever you&#39;re going to do I&#39;m just
[2761.8s] telling you how I think go to hedge fund
[2764.04s] tips.com click on terms this is opinion
[2766.319s] not advice uh as always but
[2770.52s] um this is how big money made here&#39;s
[2774.119s] what we saw we got to December
[2776.48s] everyone&#39;s smiling so wide we could even
[2777.92s] been out of sideways and then guess what
[2780.24s] uh you have this uh equal weight gets
[2782.48s] smashed for the first half of the month
[2785.04s] and just like it did in the end of
[2787.24s] October and just like it did at the
[2789.72s] beginning of September and just like it
[2791.52s] did at the beginning of August and then
[2793.52s] it always bounces back so all our stocks
[2796.16s] are coming back they&#39;ll be back and um
[2799.92s] and that&#39;s the story so but this is just
[2802.04s] a normal weird rotation that just keeps
[2805.359s] happening it happened this last time
[2806.76s] Trump got elected as well uh moving on
[2809.92s] this is the 10-day Advance decline line
[2811.599s] you can see it&#39;s oversold here due for a
[2813.319s] bounce this is the net NASDAQ uh ncy
[2817.28s] mlen oscillator again these are areas
[2819.839s] that you get bounces from uh and we got
[2822.48s] there last night uh here is the small
[2826.4s] cap uh filled this Gap maybe we&#39;ll get
[2829.119s] start to get a bounce off that in the
[2830.52s] next few
[2831.52s] days um vix got up to 27 so these are
[2835.44s] these are flush outs and we&#39;ll talk
[2837.359s] about it in the article I think probably
[2839.599s] a fun blew up certainly a lot of momo
[2842.2s] people on Leverage got smoked the margin
[2844.359s] clerks had a field day yesterday here&#39;s
[2846.359s] the max 7 with a 6.1% plunge yesterday
[2851.0s] that&#39;s
[2852.04s] huge
[2853.559s] um that&#39;s from Mike Sardi same with this
[2857.28s] is rate of change again this is what you
[2860.8s] see towards buyable lows uh Advanced
[2865.52s] decline percent same thing here these
[2868.44s] extremes you start to get a bounce uh
[2871.72s] these are the charts that we&#39;ve just
[2873.319s] covered with the pmo by all pmo by SPS
[2876.92s] ta Dow Jones down 10 days in a row
[2880.28s] longest losing streak since
[2882.359s] 1974 half of that as I said with Neil
[2885.0s] was
[2886.2s] UNH Boeing was up Disney was up Etc
[2890.319s] here&#39;s ISM Manufacturing versus S&amp;P 500
[2893.44s] EPS annual change you can see here with
[2896.16s] earnings going up the ISM Manufacturing
[2898.92s] will follow and that is very good for
[2901.4s] the overall economy and it sets the
[2902.88s] stage for an economy like we saw in
[2904.68s] Trump 1.0 where uh
[2907.48s] uh everyone participates the lowest end
[2910.76s] of economic people start to do better
[2912.559s] than ever in terms of real wages and
[2915.119s] we&#39;re going to start to see that moving
[2916.68s] forward as well us retail sales was
[2918.68s] driven by motor vehicles and Motor Parts
[2921.8s] drove the bus this was the big thing
[2923.88s] that led to the retail sales beat
[2926.359s] incentives are going up volumes are
[2928.52s] going up inventories are going up this
[2930.48s] is all perfect for Cooper standard this
[2932.48s] also helps Advance Auto Parts as the
[2935.319s] average uh car on the road is now 13
[2938.64s] years retail sales strengthen on jump in
[2940.72s] motor vehicle purchases we love the
[2942.799s] sound of that Atlanta GDP now is still
[2945.24s] tracking at 3.1% for Q4 so if you&#39;re
[2949.2s] perplexed as to why Powell uh curbed
[2952.76s] Your Enthusiasm and said we&#39;re going for
[2955.079s] two cuts next year instead of four even
[2957.28s] though we&#39;ve been saying that for two
[2958.64s] three months on this podcast
[2961.28s] um uh the economy is holding up and
[2963.68s] he&#39;ll be dated dependent you can see how
[2965.4s] quickly he pivots uh whether they should
[2967.839s] have taken two cuts off of the SCP
[2970.96s] dotplot or one cut off uh coin flip but
[2974.92s] since he had one to Center he probably
[2976.64s] thought it was good to go
[2978.4s] hawkish China pushes back against Bond
[2980.96s] frenzy send yields climbing we said
[2983.52s] these are the things that we would see
[2985.52s] as the rally starts to recover it&#39;s the
[2987.88s] same thing we saw in early
[2989.68s] 2017 before the inauguration yields will
[2992.2s] start to go up the R&amp;B is going to start
[2995.24s] to go up China economy-wide Pro prices
[2998.88s] in longest decline since 1999 again
[3001.92s] these were times 2009
[3005.04s] 2016 2001 these were times to be buyers
[3008.119s] of Chinese equities not sellers China&#39;s
[3010.72s] two-speed economy industry is soaring
[3013.04s] consumer is lagging uh that is uh that
[3017.48s] will catch up and that those things are
[3020.0s] in the pipeline NASDAQ getting close to
[3022.319s] the top of this top end range I don&#39;t
[3024.16s] put much Credence in these type of lines
[3026.24s] drawn on charts but it&#39;s always good to
[3028.68s] pay attention to Mega cap growth and
[3031.079s] Tech positioning is you know uh one
[3035.24s] PL one standard deviation above the
[3038.68s] median going
[3041.48s] back uh they don&#39;t say how far going oh
[3044.24s] going back to to so 15
[3046.799s] years uh and these are when you see
[3049.76s] these type of extremes like late 2001
[3052.24s] that&#39;s when Tech starts to sell off I&#39;m
[3054.0s] not saying we&#39;re there yet I&#39;m just
[3055.359s] saying be mindful if you&#39;re in indices
[3058.0s] that have forced you to be overweight
[3059.799s] these names uh they they keep going
[3063.64s] until they don&#39;t and when they don&#39;t uh
[3066.16s] it&#39;s they don&#39;t give you a warning
[3067.88s] signal to uh let you know it&#39;s time to
[3069.839s] get out they they they get you out
[3072.28s] harder and faster than you could ever
[3074.119s] imagine economic surprises could be
[3076.2s] turning in favor of global xus that&#39;s
[3079.319s] exactly what I talked about with Neil
[3081.88s] Cavuto
[3083.4s] the economic surprises us minus G10 at
[3086.88s] an extreme US dollar at an extreme and
[3090.28s] these things will be turning in
[3094.119s] 2025 in our view uh this chart I thought
[3097.88s] was pretty interesting four main types
[3099.4s] of AI you can start to learn about that
[3102.16s] this is going to be a 152 year Trend uh
[3105.04s] you will have a ShakeOut before all
[3106.68s] these things come to be
[3108.52s] realized uh but all the dreamers right
[3111.52s] now that are buying things up you know
[3113.64s] 40 50 times sales they are going to to
[3116.68s] be right about the theme they&#39;re going
[3118.28s] to be wrong about where they bought it
[3120.4s] and um just like we were buying Google
[3124.559s] an Amazon Handover fist in Fall of 2022
[3127.839s] when everyone was puking it out and
[3130.24s] March of
[3131.48s] 2023 and made double pluses on those
[3134.76s] easy um we will be buying a lot of these
[3138.16s] stocks when they&#39;re down 80 70
[3141.0s] 80% that have good businesses that are
[3143.92s] temporarily impaired and we will rinse
[3146.2s] and repeat that&#39;s what we do will we be
[3148.16s] buying them when they&#39;re at 40 50 60
[3149.839s] time sales and going to 80 90 100 times
[3152.079s] sales hell no because that&#39;s just
[3154.48s] gambling on can I get off the train fast
[3156.92s] enough and when you&#39;re managing decent
[3158.4s] size the answer is it&#39;s hard to get off
[3160.319s] the train fast enough uh yen is at its
[3162.92s] cheapest in 50 years again you know you
[3165.88s] go back to these points in time this is
[3168.359s] an extreme that will reverse and we will
[3170.96s] take advantage of it
[3173.599s] um on to the next China made deliver the
[3176.92s] biggest rate Cuts in a decade in 2025
[3180.359s] that&#39;s from
[3181.28s] Bloomberg uh we covered the CH China
[3184.24s] fisal Financial conditions easiest since
[3186.359s] June 20 uh June of uh 2000 again print
[3191.96s] this chart out put it on your wall and
[3193.799s] when you get nervous about the
[3195.88s] day-to-day movement in price just go
[3199.599s] back and look at what happened to
[3200.88s] Chinese stocks every single time
[3202.799s] Financial conditions got these easiest
[3204.96s] these easy this easy see what happened
[3207.76s] uh 3 months later and a year later and 2
[3210.319s] years later and you will be smiling so
[3213.16s] wide you could eat a banana sideways um
[3216.76s] number of protests is is up this is
[3219.92s] further pressure for them to take action
[3222.88s] uh market cap of The Magnificent 7 as a
[3225.24s] share of the total index I mean this is
[3227.079s] crazy town ladies and gentlemen you can
[3229.2s] see it and you can um decide if you want
[3233.319s] to continue to play on the skinny
[3235.64s] branches uh wave of stronger
[3237.92s] productivity growth starting this is
[3239.599s] great for manufacturing the global
[3241.64s] economy for people at the lower levels
[3243.72s] of income are going to start to benefit
[3245.28s] from this this is what keeps the economy
[3246.72s] humming along uh pretty exciting to see
[3249.319s] that tariffs we&#39;ve covered a million
[3250.839s] times at 100 200e plus lows everyone&#39;s
[3254.04s] saying we&#39;re going to start a trade war
[3255.799s] and we&#39;re going to go into a depression
[3257.24s] except we started in 1918 at 5% went to
[3260.52s] 18% before Holly Smoot and um and that&#39;s
[3264.68s] that so beware of the people who are
[3268.72s] speaking emotionally and unburdened by
[3271.0s] the facts they will lead you astray
[3273.68s] 10year yield so it&#39;s up against this
[3275.96s] trend line again probably poke through
[3277.68s] just to mess with everyone this will
[3279.64s] roll back over this is the this is Trump
[3282.799s] 1.0 is the same as Trump 2.0 it&#39;s just
[3285.559s] crazy town until the calendar flips and
[3287.64s] the inauguration so deal with it on the
[3290.04s] bonds deal with it on the uh dollar we
[3293.72s] bought some TLT yesterday and we&#39;ll
[3296.72s] leave it at that equal
[3299.04s] weight so here we go the midcaps came
[3302.28s] down to this trend line or whatever they
[3304.359s] call it uh small caps came down so you
[3307.28s] know whether you&#39;re buying it down at
[3308.52s] the red line or you&#39;re buying it
[3310.44s] here it really doesn&#39;t make any
[3312.839s] difference in the scheme of things uh
[3314.839s] industrial so you can just see some of
[3316.44s] these sell-offs
[3319.68s] semiconductors uh here&#39;s Pharma this is
[3321.799s] part of the healthcare theme we&#39;re going
[3322.96s] to be talking about along with biotech
[3325.72s] which we own
[3326.88s] uh quotes of the week Warren Buffett
[3328.88s] great investment opportunities come
[3330.16s] around when excellent companies are
[3331.52s] surrounded by unusual circumstances that
[3333.44s] cause the stock to be Mis appraised this
[3335.68s] is The Credo for great Hill Capital this
[3338.44s] is all we do this is our knitting we
[3341.0s] don&#39;t Veer as I said a couple weeks ago
[3344.119s] when God handed out fomo jeans he he
[3346.4s] skipped Tom Hayes I I you know there&#39;s
[3348.44s] so many ways to make money I do not get
[3350.92s] fear of loss when people are making lots
[3352.68s] of money in short period of time doing
[3354.24s] other things I just love what we do I
[3357.039s] can sleep well at night and I know over
[3358.96s] time with low leverage we can outperform
[3361.64s] materially over uh reasonable amounts of
[3364.52s] time Ben Graham the intelligent investor
[3366.88s] is a realist who sells to The Optimist
[3368.92s] and buys from the pessimist that&#39;s what
[3371.119s] we do and Charlie Monger great investing
[3373.839s] requires a lot of delayed
[3376.44s] gratification the beauty is usually the
[3378.599s] more delayed it is the greater the
[3379.88s] gratification you get uh and that&#39;s the
[3382.28s] other thing that most people don&#39;t
[3383.68s] understand a great example is when he
[3384.96s] did byd the Chinese thing he got warrant
[3387.799s] to put I think it was like two or 300
[3390.44s] million in birkshire money in it had 3
[3393.119s] 50 to 80% draw Downs over a decade did
[3395.76s] nothing and then was like a 12 bagger in
[3398.4s] 12 months from you know 2000 to 2002 so
[3401.64s] the irr turned out to be just fine and
[3404.0s] they were patient and did the thing Bill
[3406.359s] gross the market can move for irrational
[3408.119s] reasons and you have to be prepared for
[3410.079s] that you need to make big bets when the
[3412.039s] odds are in your favor but not big
[3413.88s] enough to ruin you but big enough to
[3416.319s] make a difference and we always say that
[3418.44s] anytime we put a position on regardless
[3420.88s] of how slam dunk it is we always account
[3423.64s] for what you don&#39;t know that you don&#39;t
[3424.96s] know if this position ever went to zero
[3428.52s] uh would they carry us out on a
[3429.799s] stretcher and the answer always has to
[3431.599s] be no the second question we always ask
[3434.079s] is if we were to walk into the boardroom
[3437.24s] of this company and offer to buy the
[3439.24s] entire company financed by JP Morgan we
[3442.319s] would be the equity uh at the current
[3445.359s] market price would they call security to
[3447.68s] have us escort it out because we were
[3449.359s] offering a ridiculously low price the
[3451.559s] answer has to be yes and that&#39;s why I
[3454.16s] stick in public markets because private
[3456.4s] markets will never offer you the type of
[3458.88s] irrational de uh pricing on the downside
[3462.359s] and on the upside uh that you could
[3465.48s] never ever experience in the in the
[3468.0s] private markets because uh people would
[3470.359s] look at it rationally and uh for some
[3472.359s] reason in public markets they look at
[3474.64s] Price movement and they think it tells
[3476.28s] them something when they should be
[3477.559s] looking at financials as if they were
[3479.079s] buying a normal business it&#39;s just it&#39;s
[3481.079s] basically private equity in the public
[3482.68s] markets and no one does it we do it we
[3485.28s] love it and we&#39;ll always do it so that&#39;s
[3488.24s] that Boeing uh commits $1 billion to
[3491.72s] speed up Dreamliner production the 737
[3494.039s] is back we talked about that alphabet
[3496.119s] and nine more stocks to buy for 2025 so
[3498.16s] guess what was the number one stock that
[3500.319s] Baron&#39;s put Alibaba group holding let me
[3502.96s] tell you who didn&#39;t write this article
[3505.44s] uh actually for those of you who
[3507.079s] following you know who didn&#39;t write this
[3509.119s] article but uh Andrew Barry wrote it
[3511.799s] fantastic and they say that basically
[3514.64s] you know they&#39;re being conservative here
[3515.92s] because they&#39;re putting themselves out
[3517.48s] in uh period but that&#39;s what makes
[3518.92s] Barons great that&#39;s why it&#39;s become been
[3520.64s] the best paper for over a century uh as
[3523.039s] a
[3525.24s] public as a financial publication uh
[3528.4s] Alibaba stock could be up 50% in 2025 if
[3531.839s] investors warm to the depressed China
[3533.599s] stock market there are other reasons and
[3535.44s] I think and I think it&#39;ll be up even
[3537.079s] more and they reference David terer
[3539.359s] largest position Etc um this came to
[3545.28s] me from Jeff Adams uh drop everything to
[3549.24s] join the wait list for the Tik Tock
[3552.52s] famous skims and Northface ski
[3555.28s] collection that has sold out in hours
[3558.0s] Bracken is crushing it collaboration
[3560.92s] with Kim Kardashian this is absolutely
[3563.68s] amazing what they&#39;re doing and by the
[3565.319s] way uh now where I am uh when I drive my
[3568.68s] daughter to swimming in uh Irvine
[3571.48s] they&#39;ve got this huge Vans headquarters
[3574.079s] there I&#39;m going to go see them but uh uh
[3576.839s] pretty exciting stuff that we&#39;re we&#39;re
[3578.44s] seeing happen here Trump meets Tik Tock
[3580.72s] CEO after saying China us can solve all
[3585.039s] world problems together so uh maybe it
[3588.64s] is preco Bromance has a chance in 2025
[3592.799s] according to Bloomberg which keeps
[3594.96s] logging me out China&#39;s Regulators vow to
[3597.76s] stabilize property stock markets we&#39;ve
[3599.52s] heard it before except for the fact that
[3602.039s] it&#39;s showing up in the data and by the
[3605.359s] way we missed a few charts here let&#39;s
[3606.76s] just make sure here is uh high yield
[3609.079s] spreads at a record
[3611.76s] low uh this was
[3615.039s] the changes in the FED speak so you saw
[3618.4s] this descent from Beth hammock who was a
[3620.28s] non-voting member uh and then they added
[3623.64s] this words in considering the extent and
[3627.2s] timing of additional adjustments so we
[3629.839s] know the results you can see the NASDAQ
[3631.799s] and S&amp;P here just want to make sure I
[3634.4s] didn&#39;t miss anything after that so you
[3636.079s] see the pullback here these are kind of
[3637.64s] normal pullbacks we saw it in
[3640.0s] September um saw it in July we saw it in
[3645.319s] March and we also saw that this gets
[3648.119s] extended stops above the 20-day moving
[3650.319s] average here&#39;s
[3651.92s] semiconductors so when you visualize
[3654.039s] this here&#39;s a vix to C to vix 3mon ratio
[3657.72s] hasn&#39;t got this High since early August
[3659.48s] we know that was an Abrupt correction on
[3662.119s] the uh Bank of Japan
[3664.319s] hike and then they walked it back and uh
[3668.44s] it worked here&#39;s Global stimulus fiscal
[3671.24s] plus monetary impulse uh percentage
[3673.72s] points of GDP by GDP weighted
[3676.079s] contribution and there&#39;s just showing
[3678.039s] that there&#39;s a lot of stimulus moving
[3679.96s] into the market now and so on so back
[3684.359s] to this uh this is a great article that
[3688.44s] one of my clients and Friends sent how
[3690.52s] Elon Musk and Taylor Swift can resolve
[3693.64s] us China relations this is by Thomas
[3695.799s] fredman and he&#39;s just amazed he went
[3698.28s] over there and saw all the amazing
[3700.28s] things that they&#39;re doing for
[3701.839s] manufacturing uh and read this article
[3705.2s] in the New York Times and uh you will be
[3708.52s] as impressed as I was uh here&#39;s from a
[3711.319s] hedge fund manager in Asia China may be
[3713.279s] posed for poised for a decade long bull
[3715.96s] run uh I agree with him halfway I think
[3718.319s] it&#39;s going to be 5 years and done and
[3720.76s] then article of the week healthc care
[3722.559s] left for dead stock market and sentiment
[3725.359s] results so here&#39;s that Health Care chart
[3728.72s] that shows the relative performance of
[3730.359s] healthcare to the SNP at the lowest
[3732.799s] level since the uh great financial
[3734.92s] crisis
[3735.839s] lows and here&#39;s what I wrote late last
[3739.64s] night which was uh well first move wrong
[3744.359s] move question mark and I saidwell just
[3746.88s] when I thought I was done with the
[3748.039s] article of the week chair Powell hosted
[3749.72s] the FED presser and made things
[3751.2s] interesting I&#39;ve been doing this for a
[3752.92s] while and have come out several times
[3754.24s] after fed meetings saying quote the
[3755.96s] first move is often the wrong move I
[3757.599s] think it may apply once again but could
[3759.76s] take a few days to play out this
[3761.599s] afternoon felt I wrote this uh just
[3764.2s] after the close this afternoon felt
[3766.079s] either a like a fund blew up or margin
[3770.16s] clerks were taking a bunch of dumb
[3771.88s] overleveraged money out to the Woodshed
[3774.0s] to put them out of their misery
[3776.839s] tell me how you really feel Tom we used
[3779.079s] the opportunity to top up positions
[3780.88s] across the board end of day and after
[3783.96s] hours this is not to say we got the last
[3787.72s] tick as I&#39;m sure we will see some retail
[3790.92s] selling in the morning as well but in
[3792.88s] selective spots we bought the margin of
[3795.039s] safety is so large that the downside is
[3797.319s] limited I live for days like this I got
[3799.799s] to tell you I do live for days like that
[3802.16s] I don&#39;t I do not think this is a
[3804.119s] December 2018 when Powell said
[3809.92s] um Powell said that
[3813.319s] um we&#39;re going to put it on autopilot
[3815.64s] and he tanked the market 20% right
[3817.559s] before Christmas uh as we&#39;ve been saying
[3819.68s] on the podcast not to expect more than
[3821.4s] one to2 Cuts in 2025 today the FED
[3824.559s] confirmed it with their Dot Plot and S
[3826.559s] summary of economic projections if
[3828.039s] you&#39;re wondering what drove the markets
[3829.44s] crazy it was this little green circle so
[3833.279s] uh they took the September projection
[3836.72s] uh the September projection was the FED
[3838.799s] funds rate would be down to 3.4 which
[3840.68s] would be accommodative uh it&#39;s estimated
[3843.48s] that the neutral rate is 3.5 now they
[3846.92s] took it up to 39 so they effectively to
[3849.72s] took two cuts off the table for 2025
[3852.039s] neutral rates are estimated at 3.5 level
[3854.88s] which fed is neither restrictive nor
[3857.68s] accommodative this implies that the FED
[3859.279s] will remain somewhat restrictive in 2025
[3862.599s] but does not guarantee it it was not
[3865.76s] surprising to us but apparently it was
[3867.52s] to those who are levered long in momo
[3869.359s] stocks and shiny objects so when the
[3872.24s] fundamentals are irrelevant due to
[3874.2s] structural Force selling I looked to
[3875.68s] some technicals to see when the bleeding
[3878.76s] might begin to coagulate I found a
[3881.319s] number of indications that we could be
[3883.64s] nearing that point and others that were
[3886.039s] mixed leading me to think it could be a
[3887.72s] couple Day event uh but not a couple
[3890.64s] week event hence accepting imperfection
[3894.599s] and beginning to take Vantage of
[3896.16s] opportunity where it makes amazing sense
[3898.2s] in the intermediate and long term here&#39;s
[3900.68s] some of what I&#39;m paying attention to at
[3902.559s] the moment so here&#39;s the nicey 10%
[3905.92s] volume index again these are levels
[3907.88s] where you usually get
[3909.599s] bounces uh DOW swanland trading
[3912.2s] oscillator volume again this is pretty
[3914.88s] extreme uh pring Emerging Market
[3917.079s] diffusion indicator again where you tend
[3919.0s] to get uh bounces or near
[3921.88s] bottoms uh then you got the material
[3925.0s] stocks o the 10 20-day moving average uh
[3928.88s] it&#39;s down to zero so if you don&#39;t have
[3931.0s] any material stocks this is the time to
[3932.88s] be having material stocks we have
[3936.2s] albaro um and kind of you could kind of
[3939.319s] count com stock in that bucket but not
[3941.4s] really uh same thing with healthc care
[3944.839s] stocks above the 10 20 day exponential
[3949.279s] moving average down to 6% again you get
[3952.599s] down to these levels you get massive
[3954.039s] bounces historically the NASDAQ Advanced
[3956.68s] decline issues down to -3000 this is
[3959.279s] where you get bounces uh NASDAQ mclen
[3962.52s] oscillator here again down to levels
[3965.079s] where you get bounces same with the niky
[3967.44s] mlen oscillator levels where you get big
[3970.319s] bounces uh and then finally the ncy
[3973.44s] advanced decline volume is the lowest
[3975.52s] level we&#39;ve seen even more than Co it
[3977.799s] hit - 4,000 that&#39;s
[3980.16s] mindboggling uh so many of these are
[3982.16s] stretched or near levels from which you
[3983.76s] would normally see a bounce back
[3988.44s] given my thoughts above nothing changes
[3990.48s] in Outlook for each of these different
[3992.0s] interviews which we already went through
[3994.52s] this is an important chart that we
[3996.359s] covered last week but again I want to
[3998.52s] reemphasize that the back drop for stock
[4002.44s] Pickers is the best in 25 years with
[4005.16s] correlation of stock performance at
[4007.0s] alltime lows these are periods when xus
[4010.319s] and emerging markets and UNM magnificent
[4013.319s] 493 dramatically outperformed these are
[4016.0s] these are periods where the concentrated
[4018.44s] stocks at the time like Cisco and Amazon
[4021.599s] they all took Corrections even though
[4023.279s] ultimately the thesis were right the
[4025.319s] valuation and timing was wrong um
[4028.76s] valuation too high in certain Pockets so
[4030.64s] you can see here S&amp;P price to book ratio
[4033.0s] now exceeds March 2000 high again do I
[4036.119s] want to take that bet and say this time
[4037.599s] is different the answer is no there&#39;s
[4039.2s] too much other stuff to do that I don&#39;t
[4040.72s] have to wake up at night and uh check
[4043.039s] check the Futures overnight and sleep
[4044.799s] with my eyes open
[4046.319s] uh two picks bet on jockeys plus one
[4048.4s] sector pick we covered VF PayPal
[4052.68s] xbi covered the uh G Trump relationship
[4056.839s] covered Etsy and covered uh Boeing
[4060.48s] Disney why healthc care is not dead the
[4063.44s] rumors of My Demise have been greatly
[4065.2s] exaggerated we talked about 62 of the
[4067.44s] 500 components in the S&amp;P being
[4069.599s] Healthcare uh we&#39;re down about 20% on
[4072.839s] average each that&#39;s crazy town with the
[4074.92s] market all alltime highs that&#39;s where I
[4076.88s] sniff out opportunity last time you saw
[4079.119s] that extreme where was 2009 which was a
[4082.48s] generational opportunity to buy
[4084.48s] Healthcare and biotech I think you have
[4086.76s] to be selective but it&#39;s also curious
[4089.319s] because uh Healthcare is expected to
[4091.72s] have the second largest earnings growth
[4094.0s] next year at 21% and you can&#39;t give
[4096.56s] these stocks away it&#39;s mind-boggling
[4098.359s] except when you think about oh okay
[4100.44s] people are worried about RFK just like
[4102.159s] they were worried about Trump in 2016
[4107.839s] and the thing you have to keep in mind
[4109.239s] is whether they&#39;re Republican or
[4110.759s] Democrat a lot of them a lot of the uh
[4114.679s] public servants are bought and paid for
[4116.239s] by Pharma so we&#39;ll get some stuff done
[4118.64s] at the margins but it&#39;s not going to be
[4120.12s] material enough to uh be as bad as the
[4122.839s] stocks are reflecting is what I&#39;m saying
[4125.279s] and you could see here uh healthc care
[4128.12s] got smashed after the election and then
[4130.319s] after the inauguration up 40% in the
[4132.88s] next year and same with biotech we love
[4136.0s] our
[4136.88s] xbi smashed after the election up 78% in
[4141.239s] the next year uh same with medical
[4144.4s] devices Baxter baby smashed after the
[4147.319s] election up 50% in the next year and um
[4152.839s] that&#39;s all you need to know with the
[4153.96s] theme being deals and drugs FDA and FTC
[4156.56s] being more lenient and Pharma having a
[4159.04s] big problem with patent Cliffs and a lot
[4160.44s] of cash why Baxter is not dead which is
[4163.48s] a a part of the healthcare sector so I
[4166.08s] just kind of tried to burden everyone
[4167.679s] with the facts here you can see here a
[4170.08s] history of cash flow Rising cash flow
[4173.0s] falling the last time cash flow got this
[4175.0s] low was
[4178.48s] 2016 and then the stock recovered
[4180.799s] materially from 30 to 86 over the next
[4183.319s] few years and you can just see
[4185.12s] throughout history revenues are
[4186.56s] continued to grow return on capital is a
[4188.96s] little compressed margins are a little
[4190.48s] compressed these are normal cyclical
[4192.48s] things um and then you look technically
[4194.8s] you&#39;re like this is this is so oversold
[4196.64s] what&#39;s going on technically and you can
[4198.56s] see every time you got to these extremes
[4200.48s] whether it&#39;s RSI stochastics Etc it was
[4204.239s] a basing period here it took a couple of
[4206.92s] years it&#39;s been going about year and a
[4209.32s] half here and then it just starts to go
[4212.08s] and in this case the next move was a 20
[4215.12s] bagger in this case the next move was a
[4217.36s] 15 bagger and we&#39;ll see what happens
[4219.719s] here I mean we get into things for
[4221.04s] doubles and triples over a few years but
[4223.12s] this this one might be good enough to
[4224.4s] hold for the long term
[4226.0s] uh you could see you know certainly cash
[4229.04s] flows down but it&#39;s not out and with the
[4230.84s] turnaround all we look especially you
[4232.88s] know with the stock down this materially
[4235.0s] with a turnaround what we look for is
[4237.679s] solvency risk is off the table which
[4239.44s] they just did with selling the assets
[4241.04s] and paying down debt and um and that
[4245.08s] free cash flow is positive for the most
[4247.36s] part or it&#39;s only temporarily negative
[4249.12s] like was in the case of uh Cooper
[4251.239s] standard but that was just too we had to
[4253.44s] get involved when we did
[4257.04s] otherwise we would have missed the
[4258.0s] Catalyst and um so this
[4261.8s] one uh you can go through this but you
[4264.48s] can see on balance share counts
[4266.96s] effectively the same it&#39;s down from 2010
[4269.64s] it&#39;s up from
[4271.159s] 2021 uh but not materially and then uh
[4274.8s] debt they&#39;re going to pay down a bunch
[4276.04s] of this so you can take that down that
[4277.6s] was a worry for a little while again
[4279.84s] solvency risk you can see you can read
[4281.92s] about their moat in the different parts
[4283.4s] of their business which we highlighted
[4284.84s] the important parts we&#39;re not going to
[4286.76s] go through you you know we&#39;ll be here
[4288.8s] till uh dinner if we do that uh key key
[4293.08s] points from the earnings call you can
[4294.32s] see the revenue is up 4% they&#39;re growing
[4297.32s] these are all things that are fixable
[4299.199s] this business is impossible to destroy
[4302.44s] and um I mean they&#39;ve tried but they
[4305.32s] they failed so so it&#39;s starting to re
[4308.12s] accelerate and uh they worked overtime
[4310.6s] to try to destroy it just like at Intel
[4312.88s] they&#39;re doing and some of the others but
[4315.239s] Bo they tried it every day day and night
[4317.12s] to crush it the stock the Stock&#39;s now
[4319.08s] going up every single day even in a weak
[4321.04s] Market uh which is exciting to see and
[4323.44s] what&#39;s more exciting is no one&#39;s talking
[4324.96s] about it which makes me extra happy uh
[4327.239s] that&#39;s one of our biggest positions uh
[4329.199s] so free cash flow is positive it&#39;s down
[4331.36s] yes but uh if you listen to the
[4332.88s] conference call you&#39;ll see all the great
[4334.639s] things but these are the two key things
[4336.04s] I want to see in a turnaround is
[4338.08s] improving balance sheet solvency risk
[4339.96s] off the table through asset sales and
[4341.56s] free cash flows positive that gives them
[4343.239s] the runway for operating improvements to
[4344.92s] take cold and that&#39;s why you get the
[4346.56s] doubles and triples and you sleep like a
[4348.52s] baby at night cuz you&#39;re buying
[4349.719s] businesses with long-term operating
[4352.0s] history that have shown that they have a
[4353.56s] durable sustainable moat and that&#39;s why
[4355.8s] we&#39;re looking at 30 years of data here
[4358.84s] uh actually not 30 years we&#39;re looking
[4360.8s] at uh 25 + 15 so almost 40 Years of data
[4366.679s] and you&#39;ll you&#39;ll they&#39;ll be here for
[4368.159s] another 40 years so um so that&#39;s the
[4371.28s] story here on balance margins have been
[4373.84s] good they&#39;re a little compressed but
[4375.36s] they&#39;re they&#39;ve got the plan to move
[4376.639s] forward uh the analyst that I I cited
[4379.4s] here is talking about margin expansion
[4381.719s] moving forward and why it was compressed
[4383.639s] so everything in good stead on Tuesday
[4386.12s] we put out a summary of the monthly Bank
[4387.48s] of America Global fund manager survey
[4389.719s] this month they surveyed uh 400 managers
[4392.6s] with 450 billion under management here
[4394.88s] were the key points number one most
[4396.44s] bullish Catalyst for 2025 could be China
[4398.88s] growth accelerates we agree uh no one
[4402.48s] wants Healthcare materials or energy
[4404.6s] opportunity to be had for sure in
[4407.6s] materials and Healthcare
[4410.679s] energy uh on the look we love our com
[4414.6s] stock we&#39;re going to stick with it
[4417.36s] um we&#39;re keeping an open mind but but a
[4421.159s] lot of them haven&#39;t gotten cheap enough
[4422.36s] for us to get excited uh best performing
[4425.239s] Equity index of 2025 people are looking
[4427.32s] to so some small caps and starting to
[4429.96s] look to China so that&#39;s a positive thing
[4433.08s] uh a little bit of love in 2020 managers
[4435.88s] seeing some potential for that uh global
[4438.56s] economy again improving sentiment but
[4441.239s] not extreme sentiment so that&#39;s a good
[4442.88s] thing to see and then uh Global profit
[4445.88s] expectations again elevated like you see
[4448.12s] off big trough lows uh but not extreme
[4451.28s] yet so I think there&#39;s some run Runway
[4453.159s] there certainly through the inauguration
[4455.0s] and we should get a garden variety
[4456.36s] pullback is is our best guess uh and
[4459.44s] then Cooper standard update this was
[4461.679s] exciting to see thanks to my buddy Allen
[4463.48s] for sending it over uh perfectly on
[4465.96s] track here nothing more to add uh and
[4468.4s] here is the Cox document he sent over I
[4470.52s] I follow Cox but I didn&#39;t I didn&#39;t get
[4472.36s] this one and uh or I missed it when I
[4474.8s] was whatever long story
[4477.159s] short um what are you seeing interest
[4480.32s] rates are coming down borrowing costs
[4482.159s] are coming down uh Mobility costs are
[4484.8s] coming down what&#39;s going up light
[4486.84s] vehicle sales the sell through uh is
[4489.92s] going up December it was 6 16.5 million
[4493.76s] on an annualized
[4495.84s] basis uh so let me just see
[4511.199s] here okay so uh what&#39;s beautiful about
[4516.52s] this SAR at
[4518.4s] 16.5 for that one month we got a little
[4520.84s] pull forward probably from the hurricane
[4522.6s] so let&#39;s just be you know curbar
[4525.04s] enthusiasm but uh the beauty that&#39;s
[4528.199s] happening and this is what I was saying
[4529.719s] two years ago is if these American
[4531.84s] automakers don&#39;t start selling $30,000
[4534.76s] Cars and $440,000 Cars the Koreans are
[4537.159s] going to come in and eat their lunch and
[4539.12s] now it&#39;s a race to the bottom I mean
[4540.639s] every car you get in if you&#39;re doing an
[4542.32s] Uber is like a Toyota Rav 4 or uh you
[4545.719s] know a Kio I don&#39;t even know what they
[4548.0s] call them or um Toyota Corolla or
[4553.48s] whatever and so this is where the moneyy
[4556.0s] is being made and if you look here
[4558.4s] incentives are going up transaction
[4561.08s] price is going down affordability
[4563.56s] improves credit availability expected to
[4565.679s] expand wage growth expected to
[4568.28s] continue
[4571.32s] uh auto loan rates are now down 100
[4574.08s] basis points from their Peak new
[4575.719s] inventory continues to expand and
[4577.52s] incentives are increasing incentives are
[4579.36s] the biggest leading indicator of volumes
[4582.12s] and their uh this is their industry
[4584.56s] proje ction
[4586.239s] for
[4588.0s] 2025 is
[4590.48s] 16.3 million so if you remember I talked
[4596.239s] about um 15.8 being their basic Break
[4601.52s] Even uh and effectively their fixed
[4604.199s] costs are in place which is why why we
[4605.88s] always talk about the operating leverage
[4608.0s] so if you look at if they&#39;re right with
[4610.719s] a conservative 16.3 let&#39;s say 16.5
[4613.84s] doesn&#39;t continue 16 3 that&#39;s 500,000
[4616.84s] cars which is effectively all goes to
[4619.96s] the bottom line okay the material costs
[4622.08s] are nothing all the fixed costs are in
[4623.88s] place so you&#39;ve got even if you take the
[4627.239s] low end let&#39;s say 150 a car uh 500,000
[4631.76s] cars divided by 18 million shares you&#39;re
[4634.679s] talking about
[4635.719s] $416 of earnings and if they can do $46
[4639.84s] of earnings next year and it looks like
[4642.199s] a growth story and the market starts to
[4644.08s] price in 7 the next year and you know
[4646.48s] nine the next year Etc you know I mean
[4649.679s] even on that scenario and that&#39;s $150 a
[4653.159s] car what if they&#39;re doing 175 more
[4655.52s] hybrids and more EVs and uh Etc it could
[4659.4s] be better but let&#39;s just say on four
[4661.08s] their trough multiple was 10 times uh
[4663.28s] their Peak multiple was 20 times I think
[4665.56s] it&#39;s going to be a great year for Cooper
[4667.0s] standard next year and um uh that&#39;s
[4670.52s] where it is so good things come to those
[4672.719s] who wait and those who wait longer they
[4674.84s] the Gratitude is the uh the good things
[4677.159s] are even better so that&#39;s the story of
[4679.48s] Cooper standard we very excited to see
[4681.679s] that stuff fear got flushed out down to
[4684.08s] 34 could go lower before it goes higher
[4686.48s] we&#39;ll we&#39;ll take a a watch and see
[4690.679s] um National Association of active
[4693.12s] investment
[4695.719s] managers uh that was uh that was up to
[4698.0s] 90 and chain let&#39;s just see where it got
[4700.52s] to I think it was at a peak so we got to
[4702.92s] curb their enthusiasm
[4705.159s] and then we
[4706.719s] will you know it&#39;s amazing if you take
[4709.44s] the daytime flight
[4712.48s] from I take it out of John Wayne which
[4715.199s] is beautiful it&#39;s 1015 minutes from the
[4717.6s] house um if you take the daytime flight
[4720.28s] you don&#39;t get jet lag which is pretty
[4722.96s] awesome uh let&#39;s see here National
[4725.28s] Association of active investment
[4726.92s] managers I was always worried about that
[4728.96s] I lose two days or whatever no hit the
[4731.679s] ground
[4733.0s] running all right so is that a 8250 I
[4735.719s] guess that printed
[4739.4s] today let&#39;s move
[4742.719s] to all right we&#39;re cruising along here
[4745.96s] some of the
[4747.8s] data GDP came in
[4750.88s] stronger
[4753.08s] 3.1 initial jobless claims came in a
[4755.76s] little bit better than
[4757.44s] expected Etc so nothing critical there
[4760.159s] earnings are still holding up 275 for
[4762.12s] next year mid- teens earnings growth
[4764.12s] exploration and production earnings down
[4766.96s] 7.9% top 30 weights in the last 60 days
[4770.08s] so again they got to the price has to
[4771.84s] come down a lot for me to get interested
[4774.44s] uh and then Industrials uh down
[4778.56s] 2.2% uh let&#39;s see if I&#39;m not M I&#39;m G to
[4782.88s] guess that&#39;s probably
[4784.32s] Boeing let&#39;s just see what if there&#39;s
[4787.52s] one that&#39;s really oh yeah boing there
[4790.6s] you go so that&#39;s already priced uh that
[4793.679s] was priced in at the one 40s and 150s
[4796.04s] and uh and now it&#39;s back at like 180 and
[4798.76s] on its way
[4800.6s] so um yeah wow it got down to 137 I mean
[4806.0s] felt like we had to buy stock every
[4807.52s] single day and uh and now it&#39;s moving
[4810.08s] all right so that&#39;s the story let&#39;s get
[4811.88s] on to by the way for everyone who um the
[4814.719s] podcast is over for everyone who likes
[4816.159s] to stick around for the ask me anything
[4817.8s] I think last week was the best ask me
[4819.36s] anything we&#39;ve ever had uh pretty
[4821.4s] amazing to see some of the quality
[4823.199s] coming through here uh here&#39;s from
[4825.639s] Vincent sentore asking about Yeti uh
[4828.76s] We&#39;ve covered Yeti a million times on
[4830.92s] this show and we continue to think that
[4834.199s] the financials look great and we
[4836.12s] continue to do nothing because we just
[4838.92s] can&#39;t really get our arms around the
[4841.719s] durable
[4843.239s] moat and the non-consumable nature of it
[4846.52s] but I get
[4847.76s] it it&#39;s uh
[4855.159s] jeez every time I look at it I say the
[4857.56s] same thing why don&#39;t I own this and I
[4859.639s] continue
[4861.4s] to avoid it I look I think you&#39;re okay
[4864.88s] here I just
[4868.96s] uh like I can&#39;t understand the moat but
[4873.84s] I can&#39;t understand the moat for a
[4875.679s] $20,000 handbag either so I think this
[4878.36s] is the you know Birkin bag for pickup
[4882.4s] truck driving Real Americans and uh
[4885.28s] maybe that needs to be paid close
[4888.32s] attention
[4889.48s] to
[4909.8s] um I look I I can&#39;t tell you not to own
[4913.199s] this uh Vincent uh I don&#39;t own it I
[4916.239s] don&#39;t own it yet that could change I
[4918.52s] continue to think about owning it and I
[4920.08s] continue to not own it so that tells you
[4921.84s] everything you know I you after years in
[4923.48s] the business I just trust my Spidey
[4925.0s] Sense and I&#39;m perfectly super duper
[4928.08s] comfortable with missing out love
[4931.08s] missing out errors of omission are great
[4933.56s] errors of O commission I will be very
[4937.88s] unaccepting of especially when I commit
[4940.84s] them um all right so
[4945.04s] let&#39;s take a look at Papa John&#39;s we&#39;ve
[4946.88s] covered this one many times as well the
[4949.6s] reason I honestly i&#39; I&#39;ve never
[4952.32s] loved I think you&#39;re going to be okay
[4954.48s] with this one but ever since they stole
[4956.639s] the business from the founder and
[4958.8s] basically like canceled them for
[4962.88s] Stuff uh I just I don&#39;t I don&#39;t like
[4966.04s] that you know the guy built the business
[4969.76s] and you know bunch of strangers come in
[4972.36s] and tell them that they think they know
[4974.199s] better so for
[4975.88s] me I don&#39;t know just feels like a bunch
[4978.0s] of bureaucrats running the business I
[4979.84s] guess they&#39;re doing an okay job
[4982.04s] but uh
[4991.96s] I I&#39;d have to understand this better but
[4994.88s] i&#39; never really got over that fact and
[4996.96s] you know maybe that&#39;s my bad obviously
[4998.639s] many businesses do extremely well after
[5000.36s] the founders move on but um this one&#39;s
[5004.199s] got kind of flattish
[5011.159s] revenues balance sheet
[5021.56s] looks balance sheet looks a little lever
[5023.92s] to me I&#39;m going to pass on this
[5026.96s] one next is Lucas
[5031.48s] cleaz don&#39;t know that Chris Savage
[5035.239s] mentioned biotech we&#39;ll have a good year
[5037.0s] take a look at bntx solid pipeline very
[5040.0s] cheap looks ready to break
[5042.239s] out uh I I tend to not buy individual
[5047.679s] biotech names we own a basket of uh
[5050.679s] xbi um this is like modna uh pass I have
[5055.32s] no Edge on their pipeline I&#39;m a
[5057.48s] generalist Paul
[5062.0s] Pesco okay there&#39;s no question here he&#39;s
[5064.4s] is telling me to that OLED is bottoming
[5067.04s] and po has good fundamentals so okay if
[5070.28s] you say so uh Joseph
[5073.639s] cook Merry Christmas thanks for all you
[5075.76s] do thoughts on Yeti we just covered that
[5078.239s] again I have no objection to it I&#39;m just
[5080.44s] not going to own it uh okay here&#39;s one
[5083.199s] Don L hi Tom you you always know that
[5086.239s] you&#39;re G to get a shitty AMA when
[5088.36s] someone puts a single letter for their
[5090.6s] last name so all right Don L uh how can
[5094.44s] you be confident in China&#39;s recovery
[5096.119s] when none of their stimulus Works seems
[5098.28s] to be a fundamental issue with their
[5100.32s] system uh I can be confident by looking
[5103.159s] past one day of headlines and looking
[5104.96s] out through history when Financial
[5106.48s] conditions were this easy what happened
[5108.0s] in the next 12 and 24 months and the
[5109.92s] answer is a lot of good happened
[5112.44s] after Financial conditions were this
[5113.84s] easy so you can continue to what read
[5116.04s] Bloomberg and that one writer at Barons
[5118.199s] who seems to no longer work there uh uh
[5121.28s] if you want the negative story but if
[5122.639s] you want the positive story um you know
[5125.6s] just stick to the facts have they
[5127.36s] fumbled the ball for two plus years you
[5130.32s] bet uh but uh like all politicians they
[5134.6s] make the they make the right decision
[5136.119s] after exhausting all other possibilities
[5138.04s] and it seems like they&#39;re at that point
[5139.679s] they&#39;ve done a lot of stimulus they
[5140.84s] announced more last week and uh and
[5143.84s] we&#39;ll take it from there moving
[5146.88s] on to
[5155.199s] thank you for your informative videos
[5157.239s] each week this is Richard L can you take
[5159.96s] a look at Evolution AB Swedish ticker
[5163.44s] Evo online casino operator funnels at
[5168.6s] games uh so all the profits are in
[5172.719s] Asia all right let&#39;s see
[5188.639s] Evo
[5192.159s] okay Sweden let&#39;s see
[5195.92s] here
[5198.6s] wow that&#39;s some cash flow baby revenues
[5201.8s] are growing cash flow is growing it&#39;s
[5203.679s] cheap so yeah all you got to do is
[5205.88s] figure out why is there a bearish story
[5209.08s] and what is it because I see nothing
[5210.679s] wrong with the financials
[5213.239s] um let take a look at
[5216.28s] the balance sheet yeah I
[5223.159s] mean what the margins like on this
[5235.639s] business all right what&#39;s
[5238.84s] the cash flow
[5244.8s] look there&#39;s nothing not to love here
[5247.92s] um all I could tell you is you have to
[5251.0s] understand their moat you have to
[5252.32s] understand their regulatory risk and if
[5253.639s] it&#39;s trading down just because of Asia
[5255.88s] I&#39;d be a buyer not a seller uh but just
[5259.04s] under who are their competitors balance
[5261.08s] sheets great let&#39;s see if they&#39;ve
[5263.32s] screwed anyone with uh
[5268.44s] dilution hell&#39;s the income statement
[5279.52s] where the hell is the income
[5283.6s] statement oh here it
[5285.679s] is all
[5293.28s] right little bit of dilution nothing
[5295.48s] crazy given that growth rate so uh
[5298.719s] Richard L I think you got something here
[5300.88s] but now the work begins you got to
[5303.08s] understand their competitive Advantage
[5304.639s] do they have a moat can someone come in
[5306.679s] and completely clip them what is the
[5308.92s] bearish thesis why why isn&#39;t it uh fully
[5313.48s] valued and um what&#39;s the be case and if
[5316.6s] you can get comfortable around all those
[5318.04s] things I think you found yourself a good
[5320.119s] one on to the next
[5338.36s] Euro stock from Chris Davis an
[5340.639s] undervalued copper play I don&#39;t do uh
[5344.199s] commodity stocks in general other than
[5351.96s] um some gas and oil no no thank you
[5355.44s] negative cash flow commodity stock no
[5357.719s] interest
[5371.239s] Portillos is getting Cheaper by the day
[5373.88s] we have engaged Capital same activist in
[5376.239s] vfc invested there thoughts about Paras
[5378.96s] uh I like it my kids like it haven&#39;t
[5383.6s] done anything with
[5385.639s] it it wasn&#39;t the numbers weren&#39;t great
[5388.96s] but I think it&#39;s probably worth a punt
[5391.28s] in a personal account this is not
[5392.679s] something I could sleep with for clients
[5395.28s] but I do think it&#39;s turning around and I
[5396.84s] do think it&#39;s a good product and uh I
[5400.119s] kind of like it so uh and we&#39;ve covered
[5403.239s] that a bunch of times it got cheaper so
[5405.32s] maybe now&#39;s the time to take a punt but
[5408.6s] like would this be a high conviction I
[5410.96s] love it I&#39;ve seen so many small Burger
[5412.84s] chains come and go Burger F uh Habit
[5416.0s] Burger blah blah blah they&#39;re all public
[5417.76s] promotes and they just dwindle out and
[5420.119s] die I think Portillos might be different
[5422.6s] but Sha desiah covered Pizza already uh
[5426.4s] J Su Smith by the way for for Papa
[5430.44s] John&#39;s I think it&#39;ll be fine guys I just
[5432.88s] I&#39;m just not in love with it jasm
[5439.48s] Smith uh hi Tom I want to let you know
[5441.76s] I&#39;m one CPS double away from being your
[5443.96s] client thanks for your opinion not
[5445.36s] advice my question is on
[5449.679s] qxo isn&#39;t there going to be one more
[5452.199s] delution event when they make the deal
[5454.679s] shouldn&#39;t that create one more
[5455.679s] opportunity not
[5457.32s] necessarily
[5460.719s] um I I yeah I I mean look it&#39;s just a
[5466.36s] brad Jacobs premium I want to be
[5468.48s] involved with this uh when we got in if
[5471.88s] everything goes perfect in 10 years it&#39;s
[5474.32s] an 8 to a 10 bagger and if it doesn&#39;t
[5476.76s] then I probably get out at a double and
[5478.48s] call it a day but with him things tend
[5480.84s] to work out Tim D is also asking about
[5482.719s] Papa John so Everyone likes pap Papa
[5484.239s] John&#39;s I I don&#39;t think there&#39;s anything
[5486.199s] wrong with it Hudson Technologies
[5498.52s] hdsn now this is interesting what do
[5500.679s] they do
[5525.28s] let&#39;s
[5532.76s] see HTS
[5545.08s] looks like revenues fell off a
[5560.679s] bit let&#39;s see what they
[5563.28s] do provision solutions for recurring
[5565.96s] problems within the refrigeration
[5567.4s] industry sale of refrigerant and
[5569.6s] industrial gas
[5574.52s] yeah this is materials like Dow and all
[5576.56s] these stocks that are
[5579.32s] smashed this looks like it should
[5581.159s] probably be a private company versus a
[5582.84s] public company I I tend to not play in
[5585.0s] these type of things what&#39;s the market
[5588.159s] cap 230
[5596.08s] million so look the number one thing you
[5598.48s] got to figure out here is why they&#39;ve
[5602.88s] destroyed sharehold capital for 30 years
[5605.56s] and why now is different and if you can
[5607.96s] answer that question then it&#39;s worth
[5609.52s] doing some real work on and pursuing but
[5612.119s] when I see a business like this where
[5613.52s] it&#39;s just been constant Destruction for
[5615.239s] 30 40 50 years I&#39;m not interested so uh
[5619.0s] my my best guess here is this is set up
[5621.719s] to benefit the O the the uh Founders not
[5625.48s] the owners and that&#39;s why the stock
[5627.56s] never does anything for 30 years so uh
[5629.88s] tell me why I&#39;m wrong and tell me what
[5632.48s] they&#39;ve changed or who they&#39;ve changed
[5634.4s] and I&#39;m listening but you know revenues
[5636.44s] are declining meaningfully the last 3
[5639.28s] years and uh even though cash flow is
[5642.199s] still healthy it&#39;s kind of a
[5644.76s] passero
[5647.719s] um Jonathan mcky Healthcare earnings
[5651.32s] expected to grow and I&#39;ve gone into
[5652.8s] Baxter wondering your thoughts on Mna
[5655.92s] we&#39;ve covered Mna not for me I don&#39;t I
[5658.44s] can&#39;t understand their pipeline backer
[5660.08s] is a little simpler it&#39;s devices easier
[5662.4s] for me to understand can you take a look
[5664.56s] at valet I think we&#39;ve looked at it
[5666.719s] again mining companies they have a
[5669.119s] tendency to just screw it up no matter
[5670.76s] how good the conditions
[5672.4s] are
[5682.6s] um my guess is what you&#39;re buying it for
[5685.159s] the dividend what&#39;s the dividend I&#39;m
[5686.92s] sure it&#39;s got a big dividend and that&#39;s
[5688.6s] why you&#39;re interested because the
[5689.88s] Stock&#39;s done nothing for years I mean
[5692.48s] it&#39;s the stock is been the same for
[5695.48s] again 20
[5696.96s] years like tell me why it&#39;s going to be
[5699.239s] different the next 20 years it&#39;s a
[5701.52s] Mining stock all they do is screw things
[5706.239s] up
[5713.76s] so all right so you got a 16% dividend
[5716.6s] yield so that&#39;s why you&#39;re interested
[5718.32s] let&#39;s just take a quick look to get any
[5721.28s] sense if that is sustainable
[5725.239s] usually it&#39;s
[5738.04s] not so they cashes down from 14 billion
[5741.36s] down to
[5744.88s] four and what are they doing
[5748.0s] here taking down their share count
[5750.36s] that&#39;s good
[5759.199s] free cash flows coming down
[5761.92s] but what is
[5768.08s] there all right the common Dividends are
[5770.52s] 5 billion a
[5774.679s] year and their free cash flow is
[5779.52s] 4.5 and their balance sheet is showing
[5782.48s] five billion cash my guess is that
[5785.119s] unless they hit a mining cycle that
[5787.239s] dividend is going to get cut um You
[5789.76s] probably don&#39;t get hurt with the stock
[5791.0s] it probably bounces back to 15 but it&#39;s
[5792.92s] not not not what I do I think it&#39;s okay
[5795.84s] though um and with that said let&#39;s
[5809.119s] see all right that&#39;s that so um with
[5812.199s] that said we&#39;re going to be back next
[5815.0s] week same time same place in the
[5817.159s] meantime make a great let&#39;s try that
[5819.679s] again we&#39;ll be back next week same time
[5821.84s] same place in the meantime make it a
[5823.56s] great one bye for now
