# Hedge Fund Tips with Tom Hayes – Episode 270
### December 19th 2024

**Executive Summary**
> Tom Hayes is extremely bullish on beaten-down sectors like healthcare, emerging markets, and specific turnaround stories like VF Corp, PayPal, Boeing, and Disney. He emphasizes the importance of being burdened by facts, not perceptions, and taking advantage of market despondency. He sees a stock picker's market in 2025 with opportunities in the 'unmagnificent 493'. He is pounding the table on Alibaba (BABA) and sees a repeat of the Trump 1.0 rally in beaten down sectors.

**Tom's Current Market Conviction: Bullish, but nuanced → 8/10** 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥☆☆

- Global easing cycle is favorable.
- Correlations of stocks are at a 23-year low, creating opportunities outside of the Magnificent 7.
- Trump 2.0 will be pro-business and deregulatory.

## Macro Thesis & Key Data Points
The global easing cycle, low stock correlations, and a potential pro-business Trump administration create a favorable environment for stock picking in 2025. Emerging markets and beaten-down sectors are poised to outperform. Be burdened by the facts, not perceptions.

| Indicator | Value | Tom's Interpretation |
|-----------|-------|----------------------|
| Corporate Tax Rate | Potential decrease from 21% to 15% | Would increase S&P 500 earnings by 4%, a big deal for consumer discretionary, healthcare, and industrials. |
| Stock Correlations | 23-year low | Creates a stock picker's market in 2025, with opportunities in the 'unmagnificent 493'. |
| China Trade Surplus | Record high of $957 billion | Sets the stage for outperformance of Chinese equities, especially with easing financial conditions. |
| US Retail Sales | Driven by motor vehicles and motor parts | Incentives are going up, volumes are going up, inventories are going up. This is all perfect for Cooper Standard. |
| Healthcare Relative Performance | Lowest relative performance to the S&P 500 since 2008 | A generational buy opportunity. 'The rumors of My Demise have been greatly exaggerated.' |
