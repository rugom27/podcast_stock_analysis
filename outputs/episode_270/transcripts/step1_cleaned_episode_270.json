media I had the pleasure to join the great Stewart Varney on Friday where we talked vfc PayPal and some interesting Market stuff uh so we&#39;re I want to thank Christian dagger and Preston miselle for having me on as well as Stuart vanney of course we&#39;re going to listen in now much more than that but now we&#39;re up 110 points about a half percentage points Thomas uh Tom Hayes joins us this morning uh to cover the markets for us Tom it looks like we&#39;re going to get a corporate tax cut and with any luck we&#39;ll get a corporate tax cut if we get it what kind of gain would that imply for the stock market well steu if the corporate tax rate comes down from 21% to 15% it would increase S&P 500 earnings by 4% meaning estimates for next year would go from 275 to 286 which is a big deal the sectors that would have the greatest benefit is consumer discretionary earnings would go up 6.8% Health Care would go up 4.3% Industrials would go up 4.3% why this is important is we&#39;re going to see a broadening in participation the 493 are going to do well correlations of stocks are at a 23-year low it&#39;s going to be a stock Pickers Market in 2025 still I don&#39;t understand that the correlation of stocks is at a multi-year low explain that so we went through a period of time when it was risk on risk off the market went up everything went up the market went down everything went down so you were rewarded for just owning the indices next year with correlations so low the UNM magnificent 493 there are going to be pockets of opportunity even if the indices are up 8 10 12% more subdued than this year those companies like in consumer discretionary like in healthcare like indust that didn&#39;t do quite as well are now going to start to participate because not everything is going to move up and down in the exact same way even if tech is more subdued you can find opportunities in Industrials Healthcare and so on we want you to do a Victory lap on two stocks that you brought to us first off VF Corporation you brought it to us at 15 w\n\n### MEDIA_APPEARANCE_RECAP\nif the corporate tax rate comes down from 21% to 15% it would increase S&P 500

it now and where do you think it&#39;s going it&#39;s at 21 now uh it&#39;s up about 40% since we brought it to the network and the whole story here Sue is the new CEO Brack and Daryl has turned this company around he sold Supreme he delevered the balance sheet got $1.5 billion of cash they&#39;re doing a collaboration Northface with skims with Kim Kardashian it&#39;s off the charts Vans is turning around this stock is going to double over the next two years and then it could go up from there Brack and Daryl&#39;s a proven winner had a 35 bagger at litech uh You&#39; got to deal with PayPal real fast you got 307 seconds you brought it to us at 67 it&#39;s now at 90 where&#39;s it going it&#39;s up 35% it&#39;s going to push over 100 then it goes to 150 this is another bet on the jockey new CEO Alex Chris came from into it where the stock had a 35 bagger uh he has generated six billion of cash flow $6 billion dollar of BuyBacks he&#39;s improving margins he&#39;s improving take rate their checkout fast lane has increased conversion from 50% to 80% this thing is going to hum over 100 over 150 over the next couple years we love PayPal okay VF and PayPal we&#39;ll check them out thanks very much Tom good to see you have a great weekend and we&#39;re back and then I had a chance to join Kristen Scher live from the New York Stock Exchange on Monday morning and want to thank Jeff Cohen obviously Kristen Scher and Melissa Montanas for having me on we listen in here all right we are off to the races the stock market officially open for trade in one of the final weeks of 2024 what a run and spin for the major indexes the S&P up about 27% I do want to bring in my guest to talk more about markets Thomas Hayes chaired managing member at Great Hill Capital uh Thomas always great to see you especially as we get set to rep what has been a very eventful year yeah no question about it they&#39;re excited down there and they have every right to be because I think we&#39;re in the period Kristen where seasonality is becoming favorable we just got through tax loss selling season we saw some weakness there the last week people were getting nervous little bit of anxiety about the FED meeting this week but it looks like for sure they&#39;re going to be cutting 95% plus odds of a cut this week so as we move out of tax law selling season guess what comes to town I think we&#39;re moving towards the Santa Claus rally a little bit of strength into year end despite having such strength all year long yeah it has been a lot of strength that we&#39;ve seen here and expectations I I would say are pretty high for 2025 how does that set us up in the markets yeah I think one of the things that is critical that&#39;s happening right now is the global easing cycle we&#39;ve had 64 fed Cuts so far this year another one on tap hopefully this week and that is the most amount of easing that we&#39;ve seen since 2020 and 2009 so while it feels toppy those were periods when you wanted to be a buyer of stocks not a seller of stocks but I do think it&#39;s going to be nuanced moving forward as a matter of fact when we look at correlations of individual stocks going back to 2001 correlations are now at the lowest level and what what that voted vote well for was not a continuation of tech which you saw into 2000 but actually a wide broadening uh in in our case right now the unmagnify and what you saw in 2001 to 2007 small caps started to dramatically outperform and believe it or not eming markets which no one is positioned for no one&#39;s interested in it&#39;s American exceptionalism no one wants those stocks but if you go back to Trump one oh they did quite well interesting so you seem to be optimistic on Emerging Markets is that the case Thomas I think I think you want to have some xus I think you want have some Emerging Markets I think you want to have some non- us and I think uh the US will continue to do fine I think we have to have a little bit slightly more subdude expectations you know we&#39;re not not necessarily going to get 27% two two years in a row or plus 20 23 years in a row but I think it&#39;ll be okay uh I do think you&#39;ll see some moderation in the heaviest weights in the S&P 500 which will weigh on the indices so 2025 stock Pickers Market if you&#39;re in the indices you&#39;re going to be okay you&#39;re not going to be thrown parties but 8 10 12% you&#39;re happy uh underneath the surface you can make a tremendous amount of money in that type of environment that&#39;s where stock picking fundamental analysis really come to Bear let&#39;s talk about some of the sectors um as well as perhaps some of the stocks on your radar yeah uh I think it&#39;s time for xbi I know we&#39;ve been on together I&#39;ve talked about biotech well they\n\nthat is the most amount of easing that we've seen since 2020 and 2009 so while it feels toppy those were periods when you wanted to be a buyer of

you can make a tremendous amount of money in that type of environment that's where stock picking fundamental analysis really come to Bear\n### FEATURED_COMPANY_DEEP_DIVES\nLet's talk about some of the sectors um as well as perhaps some of the stocks on your radar yeah uh I think it's time for xbi I know we've been on together I've talked about biotech well they finally come aggressively off that bottom it's taken a couple years to to consolidate the the uh the losses and now we're at the level where I think the next phase we're going to we're going to start to to move higher I think you've got two things working in favor uh deals and drugs so deals FTC is going to be much more favorable with mergers and acquisition and drugs FDA is going to be putting things out more aggressively couple that with the fact that large Pharma has more cash on the balance sheet than they've had in decades and they have a lot of drugs coming off a patent so they have it's much easier to buy Innovation at low valuations historically low valuations in the biotech SE sector then build it from scratch which takes a lot of time so we like biotech M what does this mean for volatility uh that's a good question moving forward look we're at very compressed volatility right now uh historically what you see is strength into an inauguration and then afterwards it gets a little choppy so it wouldn't shock me if we got a little bit of volatility late January early February normal pullbacks 5 10% type of pullbacks uh and then a modestly good year for the overall indices next year interesting and in terms of the new administration of course we saw the president elect here at the stock exchange on Thursday as well as many different members of his cabinet how is that shaping your investment thesis Thomas you know it's it's Pro business it's uh let Animal Spirits run it's uh deregulation this is a very positive thing uh we want to be in those companies that have actually been beaten down you know one of the companies we like which you can't give it away right now is called VF Corp okay Brack and Daryl is the new CEO for the last year he came from Logitech at Logitech he took a stock that was down 82% and created a 25 bagger in 8 years he's doing the exact same thing he's taking solvency risk off the table by selling Supreme paying that 1.5 billion dollars of debt he's got the new collaboration with Kim Kardashian North Face and skims that's going Vans is stabilizing Timberland is a solid brand and Dickies will do okay so we definitely are betting on Brack and Daryl\n\ndeals

MEDIA_APPEARANCE_RECAP\nhere is  Bitcoin on your radar uh it&#39;s not I&#39;m an equity manager uh Kudos are a lot of ways to make money for me that&#39;s not one of them but uh I&#39;ve got a lot of friends that have done extremely well in the crypto space very quickly in just about 20 seconds Thomas anything you want to hear in particular that will shape your thesis from the FED chare on Wednesday you know it it wouldn&#39;t number one I think he&#39;s got to acknowledge that he&#39;s still in an aggressively restrictive stance number one and number two it really wouldn&#39;t surprise me if he does pause for a while and I and I hope the Mark I I think the market is prepared for that get that that cut in he front loaded a lot of cuts and then maybe see what happens for the next few months before you get too aggressively let&#39;s watch the inflation numbers uh but I think maybe one maybe two cuts may be all that&#39;s needed in 2025 after this all right Thomas Hayes chair and managing member of great Hill Capital Thomas always a pleasure thanks so much thanks for having me Kristen and we&#39;re back and then I had the chance on Monday night to join sha calebs on cgtn America to talk China or Trump G relations uh pretty aggressive stance on a Chinese station but uh I think it&#39;s moving in the right direction and appre appreciate sha and Camelia Kellan for having me on enjoyed speaking with Shawn as always Los Angeles okay for a deeper dive into the impact of potential tariffs from Donald Trump let&#39;s talk with Thomas Hayes he the founder chairman and managing member of great Hill Capital Thomas always a pleasure good to see you again my friend thank you for having me Sean okay so How likely are we to see price hikes on everyday products and again we are presuming that this actually goes through correct I think this is a negotiating tactic Sean as we saw from Trump 1.0 people are worried about inflation the prices of goods going up except for the fact that inflation under Trump 1.0 was 1.9% on average uh right now China is running a trade surplus at a record high of 957 billion and the impact of any tariffs if they do go through uh is lessened by the fact that the Yuan has valued over 5% in the last few months against the dollar very similar to what happened after the 2016 election before the 2017 inauguration so there&#39;s a lot of knee-jerk reactions here Sean it may prove to be over overblown particularly when you have a president offering one of the longest Olive branches in diplomatic history to president Xi Jinping inviting him to attend the inauguration and I would say if president G Jinping is serious about recovering the Chinese economy he should accept that Olive Branch and come and negotiate and make a good business deal for China make a good business deal for America and move forward with economic Prosperity Thomas there&#39;s also no question that Trump has played hard ball not just with China but with Canada and Mexico as well and whether or not this goes through people are planning on it if you look at the amount of goods that came through the port in just the last month out in Los Angeles this shows that people are buying now so what should Americans perhaps plan on buying now ahead of a tariff implementation I think if you make a decision an emotional decision based on a knee-jerk reaction

buying now so what should Americans perhaps plan on buying now ahead of a tariff implementation I think if you make a decision an emotional decision based on a knee-jerk reaction to headlines  I think you&#39;re you&#39;re doing yourself a disservice because that money could compound invested and uh you know if you&#39;re not taking it out out of the stock market you don&#39;t pay pay taxes so uh you know if the worst case scenario happened and as it relates to other countries other than China and including China this is all predominantly about fairness and reciprocity so if Canada taxes us 10% on X we&#39;re going to tax them 10% on y uh Etc so you know phones they estimate could go up as much as 26% vacuums as much as 19% gaming as much as 40% shoes as much as 14% but you have to put this in perspective Sean we have the lowest percent of Duties collected as a percentage of total Imports in over a 100 years it&#39;s 3% of Duties on total Imports uh if you go all the way back first of all this is lower than it was under Clinton it&#39;s lower than it was under Carter it&#39;s lower than it was under JFK not by a little by a lot and for all the people worried about hoot uh uh Smoot Holly tariffs in 1929 caused the Great Depression at the Spanish Flu in 1918 5% was the total duties collected we&#39;re at 3% Now That Grew From 5% to 177% before Holly Smoot so 12 years of economic Prosperity before it hit a crescendo so we have to be careful I think this is a a starting point to bring people to the table a lot of people have come to the table at maralago to meet with President Trump uh Trudeau came down to to meet the president of Mexico called so let&#39;s see what gin ping does maybe he will accept the invitation we will have a very promising uh economically prosperous mutually beneficial relationship moving forward well but but Trump has also followed through with this in the past so let&#39;s talk about how tariffs could contribute to inflation many Americans are just fed up with inflation that probably cost the Biden Or democrats uh the election if you listen to what experts are saying so is Trump using this as a threat to Simply get what he wants what&#39;s behind this well it&#39;s part of it look in Trump 1.0 you had 30 to 50% tariffs placed on washing machines you had 25% tariffs placed on steel you had 10% tariffs placed on aluminum you had uh 4% of 4.1% of total tariffs were impacted by the tariffs he implemented in 2018 and yet the average inflation rate was 1.9% during his his term so some of this gets offset by currency some of it never happens it&#39;s overblown but we do have to keep in mind as it relates to what he&#39;s negotiating a lot of this has to do with border security and fentol trafficking he&#39;s saying stop the fentanyl or I&#39;m going to tariff you yeah but China has but China has actually said that they will work with the United States on fentanyl that&#39;s one thing that they&#39;ve said time and time again they they they are starting to do that but they have said it and it has not been the case in the previous four years it is now beginning and that&#39;s a positive constructive step that will go a long way and probably has something to do with the olive branch that was extended to attend the inauguration which I think president X should take him up on it&#39;s going to be interesting my friend Thomas thank you so much I really appreciate your Insight thanks again thank you Sean okay and then on to another topic I had the pleasure to join Neil the great Neil Cavuto yesterday and we covered everything uh from rotation to healthc care you want to pay close attention to what I say about health care and the analogy to 2016 2017 and its relative trading performance and keeping things simple so thanks to Jenna D tomases and the great Neil Cavuto for having me on we&#39;ll listen in here my favorite guests\n\nlet&#39;s talk about how tariffs could contribute to inflation many Americans are just fed up with inflation that probably cost the Biden Or democrats uh the election if you listen to what experts are saying so is Trump using this as a threat to Simply get what he

### MEDIA_APPEARANCE_RECAP\nI had the pleasure to join Neil the great Neil Cavuto yesterday and we covered everything uh from rotation to healthc care you want to pay close attention to what I say about health care and the analogy to 2016 2017 and its relative trading performance and keeping things simple so thanks to Jenna D tomases and the great Neil Cavuto for having me on we&#39;ll listen in here\n\na young man he follows us very very closely uh Thomas Hayes the chairman and managing member of great Hill Capital Tom um it was really not meant to be a com because everyone is Young compared to me but I seriously I I always enjoy hearing from you because you give us a good perspective on this and I&#39;m wondering now if these nine down Dow days I I know we in the media can make make a big deal of that and there&#39;s no connection sometimes to the overall tone of the markets but a bit of a relief rally today what do you what do you think well it&#39;s interesting uh the 50% of the 1500 Point drop in the Dow 50% was attributable to United Healthcare as a matter of matter of fact healthc care relative to the S&amp;P 500 is having its lowest performance since 2008 that was an enormous buying opportunity so there&#39;s some and that down Drive United Health really was happening before the killing of the the CEO but go ahead and it&#39;s exacerbated and and of the 500 S&amp;P components 62 are Healthcare the average Health Care stock those 62 is down 19% as Mark Twain used to say the rumors of My Demise are greatly exaggerated this exact same thing happened in 2016 after Trump was elected before the inauguration remember he was going to tear up the Affordable Care Act it didn&#39;t happen with John McCain and shortly thereafter you saw biotech rally 75% the next year Healthcare the XLV rallied 40% in the next year so I think there&#39;s going to be tremendous opportunity to take advantage of healthcare and that&#39;s part of this rotation that you&#39;re seeing in December the other part of it is tax LW selling so what&#39;s performed this year growth is performed so there&#39;s nothing to sell people want to sell those after the after the New Year some of the value stocks have underperformed so they&#39;re selling in the hole to create tax assets so let&#39;s play out what we&#39;re looking forward to in the next week or two of this year it&#39;s been an incredible year the Dow last nine days notwithstanding still up I think 17 18% year today uh can we keep this going in the new year I think it&#39;s going to be nuanced I think Santa&#39;s going to come to town we&#39;ll see a little bit of strength tax LW selling is over I don&#39;t know Santa always worries because he always wears red I that&#39;s a good point watch out not a thin color I might the Grinch is green uh hopefully there will be no Grinch this year uh we do have strong earnings but how much that is priced in is a great question I think returns next year are going to be slightly more subdued 8 10 12% for the general indices the other thing that we&#39;re say it&#39;s still not bad we&#39;re just used to 26 28 30% um you know Goldman Sachs is still saying 3% if we&#39;re lucky yeah what do you think well you know it&#39;s interesting the correlations of stocks right now are at the lowest level in 24 years going back to 20012 2002 uh what that implies is that the forign 93 are going to start to pick up the slack which means if tech does perform more modestly next year than it did this year um there there&#39;s just tremendous ways to make money under the surface so you you have to be I think a little cautious if you&#39;re too overweight in all the stocks that are working uh some of them have become really fully valued if not excessively valued in some cases you include the Magnificent 7 and tech stocks I find it always interesting looking at the Magnificent 7 even though you get an Nvidia that goes into correction ter down 10% or more from its high Tesla balanced out the rest of the Magnificent guys Tesla a little under duress today not not much but how do you play that out there because there are a lot of people who just virtue of the the strength of those stock performances are disproportionally now in Tech a lot yeah what do you tell them uh I think you want to look for simpler stocks in 2025 for example Boeing is turning around okay new CEO is turning around the ship the union problems are solved the 737 is back online that start stock is starting to take off no one&#39;s even talking about it it&#39;s up pretty meaningfully in the last couple weeks we still have those astronaut stream I mean but that Wall Street doesn&#39;t seem to care but you know let&#39;s face it up Boeing still has a whole heap of problems here but I guess is the sentiment here that it it was over beaten and is this a genuine turnaround no question about it look they have a 10year half a trillion dollar backlog the beauty is it&#39;s a duopoly if you want a plane you can only get from Boeing or you can get it from airb and if you say I don&#39;t like Boeing they were a disaster well then you got to wait 20 years from airb so they&#39;re going to fix it uh Kelly ortberg at Rockwell Collins he created a four bagger in six years for his shareholders so he&#39;s going to turn that around he&#39;s going to write the ship another simple one is Disney that&#39;s still down 50% you can&#39;t give the stock away uh it&#39;s starting to recover in the last few months again how do you play that you know because I&#39;ve asked this before but you know there&#39;s that play the dogs of the Dow for for example and and they&#39;ll have their day um but sometimes the dogs could still bark for a while before or you can get foolishly drawn in and realize oh wait a minute there&#39;s no here here yeah I think the key is low to no leverage that&#39;s where people really get hurt is if they buy too much on Leverage just buy the position and know that overtime good quality businesses always recover the number one thing so that extends to Disney that that extends does it extend to the borrowers who who want to go in and buy some of these stocks then are they cuz some of them are borrowing on Leverage of their own margin accounts of yeah I think that&#39;s a way to get yourself stopped out and nervous too soon with good quality businesses you you know good things come to those who wait some come faster the name of the game with a turnaround situation when it&#39;s a quality durable business that&#39;s been around for decades and you know it&#39;s going to be around for decades to come uh is just solvency risk if there&#39;s no solvency risk which Boeing had a little bit of people were a little bit worried but they raised $20 billion of cash they&#39;re going to be fine uh and Disney now is cash flow positive on the streaming side of the business in those just wait and they will start to recover over the next couple years you&#39;ll be very happy you don&#39;t have to guess the future you don&#39;t have to guess who&#39;s going to win the AI game you just say it&#39;s Disney everyone loves Disney it&#39;s Boeing everyone loves to fly it&#39;s going to recover the stocks are down materially from the covid highs they&#39;re going to come back but the rally continues in in in aggregate just not as crazy as we see I think the index holders will be underwhelmed and I think there&#39;s going to be great opportunities under the surface as this continues to brought remember other than the last 10 days we saw real change real broadening since the summer abut this is a pause that&#39;s going to refresh and I think we&#39;re going to see that 493 and a lot of the money is going to be made in names we haven&#39;t been talking about this year and that&#39;s what I&#39;m 493 the other S&amp;P 500 stocks not just those the other thing is um in Trump 1.0 everyone was worried about xus so no you can&#39;t give away an international stock right now whether it&#39;s Emerging Markets Europe I think there&#39;s some value there I think you want to start to get some allocation you don&#39;t have to go crazy but I do think uh what saw in his first year they outperformed so so that could be a surprise for 2025 Neil yeah these Global ETFs are already percolating so we&#39;ll watch what happens uh Tom good see you have a merry Christmas we don&#39;t chat again Thomas Hayes follows us very very well uh when it comes to and we&#39;re back and then I had the pleasure to join Stuart vanney once again on Tuesday with regard to uh Etsy and a couple other retail sales automobile sales you definitely want to check this out we&#39;re going to tune in here I want to get back to the retail sales numbers we received earlier up in the last uh 12 months up 3.8% Thomas Hayes joins me Hayes no n Hayes joins me now uh I thought the consumer was strapped but we got a strong sales report here what&#39;s going on well Stuart the one thing I&#39;ve learned in this business over the years is never bet against the US consumer when they have a job they like to spend what you&#39;ve seen since the election consumer sentiment has come up consumer confidence has come up uh Debt Service as a percentage of disposable income is still below prean pre pandemic levels and at multi-decade lows so the consumer is strong they&#39;re going to continue to be strong and not only are they buying trinkets now they&#39;re buying automobiles because the incentives are going up would you agree with the following the top 20% of income earners are doing just fine y Middle America on the edge struggling a little lower inome people really in trouble that&#39;s right uh we&#39;re seeing it a little bit in the dollar store stocks and their earnings results Etc Walmart has brought down some of the the middle inome people to spend in their stores so Walmart&#39;s still doing well but Dollar General Dollar Tree have struggled a little bit but I think it&#39;s going to get better as that sentiment comes back the jobs stay healthy and uh and Trump helps that was the demographic that did really well under Trump 1.0 so stay tuned okay we&#39;re looking at 2025 look across the spectrum of all the stocks that you follow and all the stocks that you like give me one that you think is going to do really really well in 2025 what is it you&#39;re asking me for my favorite child but uh I&#39;ll give you one uh it&#39;s called Etsy this was a covid darling the stock is down 80% it&#39;s the fourth most trafficked e-commerce site behind Amazon eBay and Walmart most people don&#39;t know that you can only get things on etay that that you can&#39;t get anywhere else so it&#39;s not a race to the bottom they&#39;re still generating over over $600 million of free cash flow and that&#39;s starting to re accelerate they just announced a$1 billion buyback they&#39;ve got loyalty programs gifting programs they&#39;re focused on International growth and bringing men into the fold so if you want to do the minimum just scattershot everyone chocolates that they&#39;re never going to eat for Christmas if you want to make them feel special get them something on eBay with their name on it they&#39;ll never forget that gift and that&#39;s why we like eBay you could move the market with that Rec that was very strong young man very strong Tom Hayes thanks for being with us appreciate than for having me uh and we&#39;re back again thanks to Christian dagger and to Preston misel and Stuart vanney for having me on and then\n\nwe're seeing it a little bit in the dollar store stocks and their earnings results Etc Walmart has brought down some of the the middle

which covers my total comprehensive Outlook right now um applies okay and we're going to talk about yesterday's flush and um how we're thinking about things moving forward it'll be a little bumpy ride when you get that type of a uh push down but you know we we try to just burden ourselves with the facts be dispassionate about things and uh pick our spots looking at some of these charts these are some of the indicators we're going to cover more in the article of the week you look at pmo buy all it's not quite down to zero so we could have a little bit more pain uh pmo by SPX is closer to areas where you see recoveries obviously active managers got over their skis all in the same stocks those got hit the hardest yesterday uh the put call did Spike up to levels where you usually see a little bit of a back off uh it wouldn't surprise me to see another foe flush just to get out all the weak hands before we bounce back uh but on balance I think we want to uh remain invested through the inauguration and we used the opportunity late yesterday and in after hours to buy some things up at uh at some nice prices and that doesn't mean we got the last tick it just means we took advantage

mean we got the last tick it just means we took advantage the other thing that I would say is going back to the Trump trade these are the\n### TECHNICAL_CHARTS\ncharts from  2016 from when he got elected uh uh to when he got inaugurated and I just want to remind you on a few of these key obviously Emerging Markets got hit the hardest after he got elected uh all the way through the calendar year before the inauguration and then they shot straight up we're looking at Baba here but it's a proxy for emerging markets down after the election into the calendar year right before the inauguration straight up uh more than a double in less than 12 months uh same with um kweb is the same same type of situation that's Chinese internet which is basically Baba you also saw a little bit of um checkback with the equal weight which is a kind of proxy for the Magnificent 493 and small caps even semiconductors saw a little bumpiness in December before the inauguration and so on so this is stuff that we've seen before solar stocks we continue to like keep our open mind because they did much better under Trump than they did under uh Biden which is counterintuitive biotech was like the wild west after he got elected sold off after the inauguration straight up we're going to cover that uh energy stocks back then went straight up after he got elected and then had a bad year the next year some of them are getting to points that get us interested but for now we exclusively are in com stock which is up a lot uh but it's just getting started um and let's take a look at some of these others just to remind ourselves not to get totally faked out with short-term moves because this type of volatility same with tech you saw some volatility before the inauguration Staples sold off big there's some opportuni starting to show up if you look at like Pepsi and Coke we haven't done anything there but we don't mind buying high quality consumer Brands when they're on sale so we'll keep our eyes peeled utilities if if opportunities come up same thing and Healthcare look at what happened to healthcare after the election remember this was as I discussed with Neil Cavuto this was the period he was going to rip up the Affordable Care Act so right now this is the period where you know RFK is going to ban all vaccines which he's told you he's not going to do he's going to spread out the schedule do things in a more rational sensible way which 99% of people agree with um and uh and the other ones are selling it to you so uh the 1% so uh this will be fine and this is going to be a great opportunity you're seeing it whether it's the fisers of the world the xbis of the world the backers of the world every single thing the you know the insurers centine Etc uh they're all beaten down they're going to they're going to it's like a beach ball underwater um and huge opportunity there and so on so oh let's just quickly remind you because everyone's probably getting sideways about this short-term offsides on us treasuries and the dollar so if you look at he was elected in November early November TLT collapsed from 108 to 95 absolutely Co collapsed and then he got inaugurated it started to Rally into the inauguration bottomed out two months later in March and then started to move straight up over the next couple of years so um so for those of you worried about bond yields compressing it's this is par for the course sell off before after the election buy into the inauguration and it will continue to persist up and yields will will compress similar with the US dollar for those getting faked out today and think that everything's sideways uh same exact thing he got elected the dollar went straight up until the calendar turned uh couldn't go any higher and then completely rolled over the next year and that's why you saw emerging markets do what it did now the P the charts that we're going to cover this week we've got a lot of them uh a lot of them are probably going to be duplicates because I was doing this on the 6-hour plane ride back to California and the internet was so so it was good enough to get the article done which I think was a pretty good and timely article we put that out at like 9:00 last night when Futures were still down uh N9 I don't know if it was pfic I the time kept changing when we were in the air but long story short we got it done uh and that was pretty timely and a pretty unconventional view when we put it out um okay so this is Bank Ling we can skip that this is S&P 500 Advanced decline percent as you can see here it got completely flushed towards levels that you see near bottoms and bounces so that also bodess well we covered a lot of our own in the article of the week\n\nso on so oh let&#39;s just quickly remind you because everyone&#39;s probably getting sideways about this short-term offsides on us treasuries and the dollar so if you look at he was elected in November early November TLT collapsed from 108 to 95 absolutely Co collapsed and then he got inaugurated it started to Rally into the inauguration bottomed out two months later in March and then started to move straight up over the next

TECHNICAL_CHARTS\nS&P 500 Advanced decline percent as you can see here it got completely flushed towards levels that you see near bottoms and bounces so that also bodess well we covered a lot of our own in the article of the week here is  the mlen oscillator again these are areas that you get bounces not uh you can go further but um the risk reward starts to get interesting then you have the health care sector this is going to be the most important chart that we cover this week the lowest relative performance of healthc care to the S&P since the 2008 lows uh so that is uh and that was a generational buy opportunity we&#39;ll talk about that this is election year seasonal composite so what did we see here we got some uh move higher early December some hard chop in the middle of December and then after the 21st straight up Santa comes to town it wouldn&#39;t shock me if that it if that turns out to be correct uh so let&#39;s see if this if this holds this is since 1928 this normal mid December uh chop is pretty pretty darn normal until the 21st so we&#39;re at the 19th so maybe tomorrow&#39;s week again and Monday uh mix and then maybe we get a little turnaround Tuesday action reason this chart keeps repeating is I think there was an accidentally a header uh put into the mix when um when I was putting this all together so we&#39;ll just ignore it uh Bull and Bear indicator is not at an extreme so we you know keep it in mind this is from heartnet uh the contrarian view The Price is Right uh oh he&#39;s talking about eight shares out perform the S&P in 2024 you China Trade Surplus just hit a record high at 957 billion China share of global car production up 1% to almost 40% the past 20 years uh okay so his point\n\n### TECHNICAL_CHARTS\nhere is  the mlen oscillator again these are areas that you get bounces not uh you can go further but um the risk reward starts to get interesting then you have the health care sector this is going to be the most important chart that we cover this week the lowest relative performance of healthc care to the S&amp;P since the 2008 lows uh so that is uh and that was a generational buy opportunity we'll talk about

global car production up 1% to almost 40% the past 20 years\n### HEADLINES_AND_NEWS\nhere is  Trump wants growth not inflation and if consensus too fearful of q1 tariffs China stock set to outperform more entry point for international inq1 so har Net's making a big call it's time to buy China stocks uh China Financial conditions are the easiest since June of 20 that was right after the covid lows we know the big rally we got into 2022 and when when was the last time that China conditions and people don't realize how how easy conditions are in China because it feels like there's a new headline every day they cut this ratio they cut this interest rate they do this half stimulus and they do all this stuff but it's adding up ladies and gentlemen and it's adding up to the point where you get massive rallies let's just take a look at the last three times that Financial conditions were this easy in China what happened so uh May 2020 and all I really care about is Baba so let's just do that um okay so you had May 2020 uh that shot up the from 190 to 312 in less than a year and then prior to that the last time Financial conditions were that easy was November 2016 that's right here ladies and gentlemen which by the way this is the analog that we've been using here let me just show you for the new listeners um this is really interesting how a lot of these things are linking together doesn't mean they'll work perfectly but it does mean that history does tend to rhyme take a look here okay so November 2016 is right here that is the last time you had Financial conditions this easy we covered May 20th so that was like a huge move 100 points in in less than a year but going back here it's interesting you're seeing the conditions exactly the same thing you have this break and then this lower low and November 16 is when Trump got elected so like right now you had Bob is starting to get uh recovered then Trump got elected you were down for a few months down for a few months and then at the turn of the thing so straight up from 855 to 200 and change in just about a exactly a year 85 to 20 84 to 207 uh and it's very interesting because Bob is recovering off these lows just like it was Trump gets elected 3 months down we're in the third month down and then straight up for 12 months so doesn't have to repeat but conditions are very similar and now that you can see it empirically that Financial conditions uh this is uh average of percentile ranks of China 10year government bond yield R&B and oil price since 2010 and when you get to that and then let's go back to 200 10 you can't see Alibaba wasn't there but let's just see uh hang sang going back to that so you can just see that this is a regular occurrence 2010 so you you had some strength there as well so here's 2016 straight up and now here we are in December of 2024 and uh maybe the other one wasn't the most important chart this is probably the most important chart that we're going to cover until we get to the next most important chart China T China Trade Surplus at record high 957 billion uh then we've got China equities the biggest inflow in nine weeks that was from last week so you got that and then S&P is skewed by expensive Mega caps the average stock trades near a record discount to the index greater than one standard deviation below average average that is a big deal ladies and gentlemen and when's the last time we saw that our favorite year 20012 2002 which set the stage for emerging markets and international to outperform along with small caps uh gap between cheap and expensive stocks is wide I mean this extreme is becoming severe and um if AI is going to be as great as everyone is expecting it's just going to take longer like it always does just like Amazon is as great as everyone was expeced from 95 to to 2000 except it dropped 90% before over the next 15 years it became as great as everyone expected and the same thing's going to happen with a lot of these AI stocks and everything else uh value trades at a discount PE so again you got to go back to 20012 2002 this is just setting up perfectly same on Price to Book same on price to sales it's all there ladies and gentlemen and if you don't take advantage of aberrational periods like this and load the boat uh and by the way you should do whatever you're going to do I'm just telling you how I think go to hedge fund tips.com click on terms this is opinion not advice uh as always but um this is how big money made here's what we saw we got to December everyone's smiling so wide we could even been out of sideways and then guess what uh you have this uh equal weight gets smashed for the first half of the month and just like it did in the end of October and just like it did at the beginning of September and just like it did at the beginning of August and then it always bounces back so all our stocks are coming back they'll be back and um and that's the story so but this is just a normal weird rotation that just keeps happening it happened this last time Trump got elected as well uh moving on this is the 10-day Advance decline line you can see it's oversold here due for a bounce this is the net NASDAQ uh ncy mlen oscillator again these are areas that you get bounces from uh and we got there last night uh\n\naverage that is a big deal ladies and gentlemen and when&#39;s the last time we saw that our favorite year 20012 2002 which set the stage for emerging markets and international to outperform along with small caps uh gap between cheap and expensive stocks is wide I mean this extreme is becoming severe and um if AI is going to be as great as everyone is expecting it&#39;s just going to take longer like it always does just like Amazon is as great as everyone was

rotation that just keeps happening it happened this last time Trump got elected as well \n### TECHNICAL_CHARTS\nmoving on this is the 10-day Advance decline line you can see it&#39;s oversold here due for a bounce this is the net NASDAQ uh ncy mlen oscillator again these are areas that you get bounces from uh and we got there last night  here is\n\nthe small cap uh filled this Gap maybe we&#39;ll get start to get a bounce off that in the next few days um vix got up to 27 so these are these are flush outs and we&#39;ll talk about it in the article I think probably a fun blew up certainly a lot of momo people on Leverage got smoked the margin clerks had a field day yesterday here&#39;s the max 7 with a 6.1% plunge yesterday that&#39;s huge um that&#39;s from Mike Sardi same with this is rate of change again this is what you see towards buyable lows uh Advanced decline percent same thing here these extremes you start to get a bounce uh these are the charts that we&#39;ve just covered with the pmo by all pmo by SPS ta Dow Jones down 10 days in a row longest losing streak since 1974 half of that as I said with Neil was UNH Boeing was up Disney was up Etc here&#39;s ISM Manufacturing versus S&P 500 EPS annual change you can see here with earnings going up the ISM Manufacturing will follow and that is very good for the overall economy and it sets the stage for an economy like we saw in Trump 1.0 where uh uh everyone participates the lowest end of economic people start to do better than ever in terms of real wages and we&#39;re going to start to see that moving forward as well us retail sales was driven by motor vehicles and Motor Parts drove the bus this was the big thing that led to the retail sales beat incentives are going up volumes are going up inventories are going up this is all perfect for Cooper standard this also helps Advance Auto Parts as the average uh car on the road is now 13 years retail sales strengthen on jump in motor vehicle purchases we love the sound of that Atlanta GDP now is still tracking at 3.1% for Q4 so if you&#39;re perplexed as to why Powell uh curbed Your Enthusiasm and said we&#39;re going for two cuts next year instead of four even though we&#39;ve been saying that for two three months on this podcast um uh the economy is holding up and he&#39;ll be dated dependent you can see how quickly he pivots uh whether they should have taken two cuts off of the SCP dotplot or one cut off uh coin flip but since he had one to Center he probably thought it was good to go hawkish China pushes back against Bond frenzy send yields climbing we said these are the things that we would see as the rally starts to recover it&#39;s the same thing we saw in early 2017 before the inauguration yields will start to go up the R&amp;B is going to start to go up China economy-wide Pro prices in longest decline since 1999 again these were times 2009 2016 2001 these were times to be buyers of Chinese equities not sellers China&#39;s two-speed economy industry is soaring consumer is lagging uh that is uh that will catch up and that those things are in the pipeline NASDAQ getting close to the top of this top end range I don&#39;t put much Credence in these type of lines drawn on charts but it&#39;s always good to pay attention to Mega cap growth and Tech positioning is you know uh one PL one standard deviation above the median going back uh they don&#39;t say how far going oh going back to to so 15 years uh and these are when you see these type of extremes like late 2001 that&#39;s when Tech starts to sell off I&#39;m not saying we&#39;re there yet I&#39;m just saying be mindful if you&#39;re in indices that have forced you to be overweight these names uh they they keep going until they don&#39;t and when they don&#39;t uh it&#39;s they don&#39;t give you a warning signal to uh let you know it&#39;s time to get out they they they get you out harder and faster than you could ever imagine economic surprises could be turning in favor of global xus that&#39;s exactly what I talked about with Neil Cavuto the economic surprises us minus G10 at an extreme US dollar at an extreme and these things will be turning in 2025 in our view uh this chart I thought was pretty interesting four main types of AI you can start to learn about that this is going to be a 152 year Trend uh you will have a ShakeOut before all these things come to be realized uh but all the dreamers right now that are buying things up you know 40 50 times sales they are going to to be right about the theme they&#39;re going to be wrong about where they bought it and um just like we were buying Google an Amazon Handover fist in Fall of 2022 when everyone was puking it out and March of 2023 and made double pluses on those easy um we will be buying a lot of these stocks when they&#39;re down 80 70 80% that have good businesses that are temporarily impaired and we will rinse and repeat that&#39;s what we do will we be buying them when they&#39;re at 40 50 60 time sales and going to 80 90 100 times sales hell no because that&#39;s just gambling on can I get off the train fast enough and when you&#39;re managing decent size the answer is it&#39;s hard to get off the train fast enough uh yen is at its cheapest in 50 years again you know you go back to these points in time this is an extreme that will reverse and we will take advantage of it um on to the next China made deliver the biggest rate Cuts in a decade in 2025 that&#39;s from Bloomberg uh we covered the CH China fisal Financial conditions easiest since June

opportunities come around when excellent companies are surrounded by unusual circumstances that cause the stock to be Mis appraised this is The Credo for great Hill Capital this is all we do this is our knitting we don&#39;t Veer as I said a couple weeks ago when God handed out fomo jeans he he skipped Tom Hayes I I you know there&#39;s so many ways to make money I do not get fear of loss when people are making lots of money in short period of time doing other things I just love what we do I can sleep well at night and I know over time with low leverage we can outperform materially over uh reasonable amounts of time Ben Graham the intelligent investor is a realist who sells to The Optimist and buys from the pessimist that&#39;s what we do and Charlie Monger great investing requires a lot of delayed gratification the beauty is usually the more delayed it is the greater the gratification you get uh and that&#39;s the other thing that most people don&#39;t understand a great example is when he did byd the Chinese thing he got warrant to put I think it was like two or 300 million in birkshire money in it had 3 50 to 80% draw Downs over a decade did nothing and then was like a 12 bagger in 12 months from you know 2000 to 2002 so the irr turned out to be just fine and they were patient and did the thing Bill gross the market can move for irrational reasons and you have to be prepared for that you need to make big bets when the odds are in your favor but not big enough to ruin you but big enough to make a difference and we always say that anytime we put a position on regardless of how slam dunk it is we always account for what you don&#39;t know that you don&#39;t know if this position ever went to zero uh would they carry us out on a stretcher and the answer always has to be no the second question we always ask is if we were to walk into the boardroom of this company and offer to buy the entire company financed by JP Morgan we would be the equity uh at the current market price would they call security to have us escort it out because we were offering a ridiculously low price the answer has to be yes and that&#39;s why I stick in public markets because private markets will never offer you the type of irrational de uh pricing on the downside and on the upside uh that you could never ever experience in the in the private markets because uh people would look at it rationally and uh for some reason in public markets they look at Price movement and they think it tells them something when they should be looking at financials as if they were buying a normal business it&#39;s just it&#39;s basically private equity in the public markets and no one does it we do it we love it and we&#39;ll always do it so that&#39;s that ###

and sentiment results  so here&#39;s that Health Care chart that shows the relative performance of healthcare to the SNP at the lowest level since the uh great financial crisis lows and here&#39;s what I wrote late last night which was uh well first move wrong move question mark and I saidwell just when I thought I was done with the article of the week chair Powell hosted the FED presser and made things interesting I&#39;ve been doing this for a while and have come out several times after fed meetings saying quote the first move is often the wrong move I think it may apply once again but could take a few days to play out this afternoon felt I wrote this uh just after the close this afternoon felt either a like a fund blew up or margin clerks were taking a bunch of dumb overleveraged money out to the Woodshed to put them out of their misery tell me how you really feel Tom we used the opportunity to top up positions across the board end of day and after hours this is not to say we got the last tick as I&#39;m sure we will see some retail selling in the morning as well but in selective spots we bought the margin of safety is so large that the downside is limited I live for days like this I got to tell you I do live for days like that I don&#39;t I do not think this is a December 2018 when Powell said um Powell said that um we&#39;re going to put it on autopilot and he tanked the market 20% right before Christmas uh as we&#39;ve been saying on the podcast not to expect more than one to2 Cuts in 2025 today the FED confirmed it with their Dot Plot and S summary of economic projections if you&#39;re wondering what drove the markets crazy it was this little green circle so uh they took the September projection uh the September projection was the FED funds rate would be down to 3.4 which would be accommodative uh it&#39;s estimated that the neutral rate is 3.5 now they took it up to 39 so they effectively to took two cuts off the table for 2025 neutral rates are estimated at 3.5 level which fed is neither restrictive nor accommodative this implies that the FED will remain somewhat restrictive in 2025 but does not guarantee it it was not surprising to us but apparently it was to those who are levered long in momo stocks and shiny objects so when the fundamentals are irrelevant due to structural Force selling I looked to some technicals to see when the bleeding might begin to coagulate I found a number of indications that we could be nearing that point and others that were mixed leading me to think it could be a couple Day event uh but not a couple week event hence accepting imperfection and beginning to take Vantage of opportunity where it makes amazing sense in the intermediate and long term here&#39;s some of what I&#39;m paying attention to at the moment so here&#39;s the nicey 10% volume index again these are levels where you usually get bounces uh DOW swanland trading oscillator volume again this is pretty extreme uh pring Emerging Market diffusion indicator again where you tend to get uh bounces or near bottoms uh then you got the material stocks o the 10 20-day moving average uh it&#39;s down to zero so if you don&#39;t have any material stocks this is the time to be having material stocks we have albaro um and kind of you could kind of count com stock in that bucket but not really uh same thing with healthc care stocks above the 10 20 day exponential moving average down to 6% again you get down to these levels you get massive bounces historically the NASDAQ Advanced decline issues down to -3000 this is where you get bounces uh NASDAQ mclen oscillator here again down to levels where you get bounces same with the niky mlen oscillator levels where you get big bounces uh and then\n\nthe table for 2025 neutral rates are estimated at 3.5 level which fed is neither restrictive nor accommodative this implies that the FED will remain somewhat restrictive in 2025 but does not guarantee it it was not surprising to us

volume is the lowest level we&#39;ve seen even more than Co it hit - 4,000 that&#39;s mindboggling uh so many of these are stretched or near levels from which you would normally see a bounce back given my thoughts above nothing changes in Outlook for each of these different interviews which we already went through this is an important chart that we covered last week but again I want to reemphasize that the back drop for stock Pickers is the best in 25 years with correlation of stock performance at alltime lows these are periods when xus and emerging markets and UNM magnificent 493 dramatically outperformed these are these are periods where the concentrated stocks at the time like Cisco and Amazon they all took Corrections even though ultimately the thesis were right the valuation and timing was wrong um valuation too high in certain Pockets so you can see here S&amp;P price to book ratio now exceeds March 2000 high again do I want to take that bet and say this time is different the answer is no there&#39;s too much other stuff to do that I don&#39;t have to wake up at night and uh check check the Futures overnight and sleep with my eyes open uh two picks bet on jockeys plus one sector pick we covered VF PayPal xbi covered the uh G Trump relationship covered Etsy and covered uh Boeing Disney why healthc care is not dead the rumors of My Demise have been greatly exaggerated we talked about 62 of the 500 components in the S&amp;P being Healthcare uh we&#39;re down about 20% on average each that&#39;s crazy town with the market all alltime highs that&#39;s where I sniff out opportunity last time you saw that extreme where was 2009 which was a generational opportunity to buy Healthcare and biotech I think you have to be selective but it&#39;s also curious because uh Healthcare is expected to have the second largest earnings growth next year at 21% and you can&#39;t give these stocks away it&#39;s mind-boggling except when you think about oh okay people are worried about RFK just like they were worried about Trump in 2016 and the thing you have to keep in mind is whether they&#39;re Republican or Democrat a lot of them a lot of the uh public servants are bought and paid for by Pharma so we&#39;ll get some stuff done at the margins but it&#39;s not going to be material enough to uh be as bad as the stocks are reflecting is what I&#39;m saying and you could see here uh healthc care got smashed after the election and then after the inauguration up 40% in the next year and same with biotech we love our xbi smashed after the election up 78% in the next year uh same with medical devices Baxter baby smashed after the election up 50% in the next year and um that&#39;s all you need to know with the theme being deals and drugs FDA and FTC being more lenient and Pharma having a big problem with patent Cliffs and a lot of cash why Baxter is not dead which is a a part of the healthcare sector so I just kind of tried to burden everyone with the facts here you can see here a history of cash flow Rising cash flow falling the last time cash flow got this low was 2016 and then the stock recovered materially from 30 to 86 over the next few years and you can just see throughout history revenues are continued to grow return on capital is a little compressed margins are a little compressed these are normal cyclical things um and then you look technically you&#39;re like this is this is so oversold what&#39;s going on technically and you can see every time you got to these extremes whether it&#39;s RSI stochastics Etc it was a basing period here it took a couple of years it&#39;s been going about year and a half here and then it just starts to go and in this case the next move was a 20 bagger in this case the next move was a 15 bagger and we&#39;ll see what happens here I mean we get into things for doubles and triples over a few years but this this one might be good enough to hold for the long term uh you could see you know certainly cash flows down but uh it&#39;s not out and with the turnaround all we look especially you know with the stock down this materially with a turnaround what we look for is solvency risk is off the table which they just did with selling the assets and paying down debt and um and that free cash flow is positive for the most part or it&#39;s only temporarily negative like was in the case of uh Cooper standard but that was just too we had to get involved when we did otherwise we would have missed the Catalyst and um so this one uh you can go through this but you can see on balance share counts effectively the same it&#39;s down from 2010 it&#39;s up from 2021 uh but not materially and then uh debt they&#39;re going to pay down a bunch of this so you can take that down that was a worry for a little while again solvency risk you can see you can read about their moat in the different parts of their business which we highlighted the important parts we&#39;re not going to go through you you know we&#39;ll be here till uh dinner if we do that uh key key points from the earnings call you can see the revenue is up 4% they&#39;re growing these are all things that are fixable this business is impossible to destroy and um I mean they&#39;ve tried but they they failed so so it&#39;s starting to re accelerate and uh they worked overtime to try to destroy it just like at Intel they&#39;re doing and some of the others but Bo they tried it every day day and night to crush it the stock the Stock&#39;s now going up every single day even in a weak Market uh which is exciting to see and what&#39;s more exciting is no one&#39;s talking about it which makes me extra happy uh that&#39;s one of our biggest positions uh so free cash flow is positive it&#39;s down yes but uh if you listen to the conference call you&#39;ll see all the great things but these are the two key things I want to see in a turnaround is improving balance sheet solvency risk off the table through asset sales and free cash flows positive that gives them the runway for operating improvements to take cold and that&#39;s why you get the doubles and triples and you sleep like a baby at night cuz you&#39;re buying businesses with long-term operating history that have shown that they have a durable sustainable moat and that&#39;s why we&#39;re looking at 30 years of data here uh actually not 30 years we&#39;re looking at uh 25 + 15 so almost 40 Years of data and you&#39;ll you&#39;ll they&#39;ll be here for another 40 years so um so that&#39;s the story here on balance margins have been good they&#39;re a little compressed but they&#39;re they&#39;ve got the plan to move forward uh the analyst that I I cited\n\nthey failed so so it&#39;s starting to re accelerate and uh they worked overtime to try to destroy it just like at Intel they&#39;re doing and some of the others but Bo they tried it every day day and night to crush it the stock the Stock&#39;s now

cited\n### MEDIA_APPEARANCE_RECAP\nhere is  talking about margin expansion moving forward and why it was compressed so everything in good stead on Tuesday we put out a summary of the monthly Bank of America Global fund manager survey this month they surveyed uh 400 managers with 450 billion under management here were the key points number one most bullish Catalyst for 2025 could be China growth accelerates we agree uh no one wants Healthcare materials or energy opportunity to be had for sure in materials and Healthcare energy uh on the look we love our com stock we&#39;re going to stick with

starting to look to China so that&#39;s a positive thing uh a little bit of love in 2020 managers seeing some potential for that uh global economy again improving sentiment but not extreme sentiment so that&#39;s a good thing to see and then uh Global profit expectations again elevated like you see off big trough lows uh but not extreme yet so I think there&#39;s some run Runway there certainly through the inauguration and we should get a garden variety pullback is is our best guess uh and then Cooper standard update this was exciting to see thanks to my buddy Allen for sending it over uh perfectly on track here nothing more to add uh and\n\nhere were the key points number one most bullish Catalyst for 2025 could be China growth accelerates we agree uh no one wants Healthcare materials

here nothing more to add uh and the Cox document he sent over I I follow Cox but I didn&#39;t I didn&#39;t get this one and uh or I missed it when I was whatever long story short um what are you seeing interest rates are coming down borrowing costs are coming down uh Mobility costs are coming down what&#39;s going up light vehicle sales the sell through uh is going up December it was 6 16.5 million on an annualized basis uh so let me just see here okay so uh what&#39;s beautiful about this SAR at 16.5 for that one month we got a little pull forward probably from the hurricane so let&#39;s just be you know curbar enthusiasm but uh the beauty that&#39;s happening and this is what I was saying two years ago is if these American automakers don&#39;t start selling $30,000 Cars and $440,000 Cars the Koreans are going to come in and eat their lunch and now it&#39;s a race to the bottom I mean every car you get in if you&#39;re doing an Uber is like a Toyota Rav 4 or uh you know a Kio I don&#39;t even know what they call them or um Toyota Corolla or whatever and so this is where the moneyy is being made and if you look here incentives are going up transaction price is going down affordability improves credit availability expected to expand wage growth expected to continue uh auto loan rates are now down 100 basis points from their Peak new inventory continues to expand and incentives are increasing incentives are the biggest leading indicator of volumes and their uh this is their industry proje ction for 2025 is 16.3 million so if you remember I talked about um 15.8 being their basic Break Even uh and effectively their fixed costs are in place which is why why we always talk about the operating leverage so if you look at if they&#39;re right with a conservative 16.3 let&#39;s say 16.5 doesn&#39;t continue 16 3 that&#39;s 500,000 cars which is effectively all goes to the bottom line okay the material costs are nothing all the fixed costs are in place so you&#39;ve got even if you take the low end let&#39;s say 150 a car uh 500,000 cars divided by 18 million shares you&#39;re talking about $416 of earnings and if they can do $46 of earnings next year and it looks like a growth story and the market starts to price in 7 the next year and you know nine the next year Etc you know I mean even on that scenario and that&#39;s $150 a car what if they&#39;re doing 175 more hybrids and more EVs and uh Etc it could be better but let&#39;s just say on four their trough multiple was 10 times uh their Peak multiple was 20 times I think it&#39;s

all right so that&#39;s the story let&#39;s get on to\n\nask me anything  we've ever had uh pretty amazing to see some of the quality coming through here uh here's from Vincent sentore asking about Yeti uh We've covered Yeti a million times on this show and we continue to think that the financials look great and we continue to do nothing because we just can't really get our arms around the durable moat and the non-consumable nature of it but I get it it's uh jeez every time I look at it I say the same thing why don't I own this and I continue to avoid it I look I think you're okay here I just uh like I can't understand the moat but I can't understand the moat for a $20,000 handbag either so I think this is the you know Birkin bag for pickup truck driving Real Americans and uh maybe that needs to be paid close attention to um I look I I can't tell you not to own this uh Vincent uh I don't own it I don't own it yet that could change I continue to think about owning it and I continue to not own it so that tells you everything you know I you after years in the business I just trust my Spidey Sense and I'm perfectly super duper comfortable with missing out love missing out errors of omission are great errors of O commission I will be very unaccepting of especially when I commit them ### ASK_ME_ANYTHING_QA\nall right so let's take a look at Papa John's we've covered this one many times as well the reason I honestly i' I've never loved I think you're going to be okay with this one but ever since they stole the business from the founder and basically like canceled them for Stuff uh I just I don't I don't like that you know the guy built the business and you know bunch of strangers come in and tell them that they think they know better so for me I don't know just feels like a bunch of bureaucrats running the business I guess they're doing an okay job but uh I I'd have to understand this better but i' never really got over that fact and you know maybe that's my bad obviously many businesses do extremely well after the founders move on but um this one's got kind of flattish revenues balance sheet looks balance sheet looks a little lever to me I'm going to pass on this one next is Lucas cleaz don't know that Chris Savage mentioned biotech we'll have a good year take a look at bntx solid pipeline very cheap looks ready to break out uh I I tend to not buy individual biotech names we own a basket of uh xbi um this is like modna uh pass I have no Edge on their pipeline I'm a generalist Paul Pesco okay there's no question here he's is telling me to that OLED is bottoming and po has good fundamentals so okay if you say so uh Joseph cook Merry Christmas thanks for all you do thoughts on Yeti we just covered that again I have no objection to it I'm just not going to own it uh okay here's one Don L hi Tom you you always know that you're G to get a shitty AMA when someone puts a single letter for their last name so all right Don L uh how can you be confident in China's recovery when none of their stimulus Works seems to be a fundamental issue with their system uh I can be confident by looking past one day of\n\n### ASK_ME_ANYTHING_QA\nlet&#39;s take a look at Papa John&#39;s we&#39;ve covered this one many times as well the reason I honestly i&#39; I&#39;ve never loved I think you&#39;re going to be okay with this one but ever since they

you always know that you&#39;re G to get a shitty AMA when someone puts a single letter for their last name so all right Don L uh how can you be confident in China&#39;s recovery when none of their stimulus Works seems to be a fundamental issue with their system uh I can be confident by looking past one day of headlines  and looking out through history when Financial conditions were this easy what happened in the next 12 and 24 months and the answer is a lot of good happened after Financial conditions were this easy so you can continue to what read Bloomberg and that one writer at Barons who seems to no longer work there uh uh if you want the negative story but if you want the positive story um you know just stick to the facts have they fumbled the ball for two plus years you bet uh but uh like all politicians they make the they make the right decision after exhausting all other possibilities and it seems like they&#39;re at that point they&#39;ve done a lot of stimulus they announced more last week and uh and we&#39;ll take it from there moving on to thank you for your informative videos each week this is Richard L can you take a look at Evolution AB Swedish ticker Evo online casino operator funnels at games uh so all the profits are in Asia all right let&#39;s see Evo okay Sweden let&#39;s see here wow that&#39;s some cash flow baby revenues are growing cash flow is growing it&#39;s cheap so yeah all you got to do is figure out why is there a bearish story and what is it because I see nothing wrong with the financials um let take a look at the balance sheet yeah I mean what the margins like on this business all right what&#39;s the cash flow look there&#39;s nothing not to love here um all I could tell you is you have to understand their moat you have to understand their regulatory risk and if it&#39;s trading down just because of Asia I&#39;d be a buyer not a seller uh but just under who are their competitors balance sheets great let&#39;s see if they&#39;ve screwed anyone with uh dilution hell&#39;s the income statement where the hell is the income statement oh here it is all right little bit of dilution nothing crazy given that growth rate so uh Richard L I think you got something here but now the work begins you got to understand their competitive Advantage do they have a moat can someone come in and completely clip them what is the bearish thesis why why isn&#39;t it uh fully valued and um what&#39;s the be case and if you can get comfortable around all those things I think you found yourself a good one on to the next Euro stock from Chris Davis an undervalued copper play I don&#39;t do uh commodity stocks in general other than um some gas and oil no no thank you negative cash flow commodity stock no interest Portillos is getting Cheaper by the day we have engaged Capital same activist in vfc invested there thoughts about Paras uh I like it my kids like it haven&#39;t done anything with it it wasn&#39;t the numbers weren&#39;t great but I think it&#39;s probably worth a punt in a personal account this is not something I could sleep with for clients but I do think it&#39;s turning around and I do think it&#39;s a good product and uh I kind of like it so uh and we&#39;ve covered that a bunch of times it got cheaper so maybe now&#39;s the time to take a punt but like would this be a high conviction I love it I&#39;ve seen so many small Burger chains come and go Burger F uh Habit Burger blah blah blah they&#39;re all public promotes and they just dwindle out and die I think Portillos might be different but Sha desiah covered Pizza already uh J Su Smith by the way for for Papa John&#39;s I think it&#39;ll be fine guys I just I&#39;m just not in love with it jasm Smith uh hi Tom I want to let you know I&#39;m one CPS double away from being your client thanks for your opinion not advice my question is on qxo isn&#39;t there going to be one more delution event when they make the deal shouldn&#39;t that create one more opportunity not necessarily um I I yeah I I mean look it&#39;s just a brad Jacobs premium I want to be involved with this uh when we got in if everything goes perfect in 10 years it&#39;s an 8 to a 10 bagger and if it doesn&#39;t then I probably get out at a double and call it a day but with him things tend to work out Tim D is also asking about Papa John so Everyone likes pap Papa John&#39;s I I don&#39;t think there&#39;s anything wrong with it Hudson Technologies hdsn now this is interesting what do they do let&#39;s see HTS looks like revenues fell off a bit let&#39;s see what they do provision solutions for recurring problems within the refrigeration industry sale of refrigerant and industrial gas yeah this is materials like Dow and all these stocks that are smashed this looks like it should probably be a private company versus a public company I I tend to not play in these type of things what&#39;s the market cap 230 million so look the number one thing you got to figure out\n\nbut I do think it&#39;s turning around and I do think it&#39;s a good product and uh I kind of like it so uh and we&#39;ve covered that a bunch of times it got cheaper so maybe now&#39;s the time to take a punt but like would this be a high conviction I love it I&#39;ve seen so many small Burger chains come and go Burger F uh Habit Burger blah blah blah they&#39;re all

refrigerant and industrial gas yeah this is materials like Dow and all these stocks that are smashed this looks like it should probably be a private company versus a public company I I tend to not play in these type of things what&#39;s the market cap 230 million so look the number one thing you got to figure out here is  why they&#39;ve destroyed sharehold capital for 30 years and why now is different and if you can answer that question then it&#39;s worth doing some real work on and pursuing but when I see a business like this where it&#39;s just been constant Destruction for 30 40 50 years I&#39;m not interested so uh my my best guess\n\n### ASK_ME_ANYTHING_QA\nhere is why they've destroyed sharehold capital for 30 years and why now is different and if you can answer that question then it's worth doing some real work on and pursuing but when I see a business like this where it's just been constant Destruction for 30 40 50 years I'm not interested so uh my my best guess this is set up to benefit the O the the uh Founders not the owners and that's why the stock never does anything for 30 years so uh tell me why I'm wrong and tell me what they've changed or who they've changed and I'm listening but you know revenues are declining meaningfully the last 3 years and uh even though cash flow is still healthy it's kind of a passero um Jonathan mcky Healthcare earnings expected to grow and I've gone into Baxter wondering your thoughts on Mna we've covered Mna not for me I don't I can't understand their pipeline backer is a little simpler it's devices easier for me to understand can you take a look at valet I think we've looked at it again mining companies they have a tendency to just screw it up no matter how good the conditions are um my guess is what you're buying it for the dividend what's the dividend I'm sure it's got a big dividend and that's why you're interested because the Stock's done nothing for years I mean it's the stock is been the same for again 20 years like tell me why it's going to be different the next 20 years it's a Mining stock all they do is screw things up so all right so you got a 16% dividend yield so that's why you're interested let's just take a quick look to get any sense if that is sustainable usually it's not so they cashes down from 14 billion down to four and what are they doing here taking down their share count that's good free cash flows coming down but what is there all right the common Dividends are 5 billion a year and their free cash flow is 4.5 and their balance sheet is showing five billion cash my guess is that unless they hit a mining cycle that dividend is going to get cut um You probably don't get hurt with the stock it probably bounces back to 15 but it's not not not what I do I think it's okay though um and\n\ntell me why I&#39;m wrong and tell me what they&#39;ve changed or who they&#39;ve changed and I&#39;m listening but you know revenues are declining meaningfully the last 3 years and uh even though cash flow is still healthy it&#39;s kind of a passero um Jonathan mcky Healthcare earnings expected to grow and I&#39;ve gone into Baxter wondering your thoughts on Mna

don&#39;t know what you own just don&#39;t dump it in the hole many people are shaking out of great stocks due to bad headlines because they don&#39;t know what they own burden yourself with the facts just be burdened by the facts and the data then I burden myself with the facts separate the facts from the perception of the facts Mr Market despondency uh for accumulation and Mr Market Euphoria for distribution that is that&#39;s our model right there it&#39;s not rocket science that&#39;s that&#39;s all we do and that gets that desponding if you&#39;re not in buying find another business despondency turns to Euphoria if they still have a job at the exact wrong time price is what you pay value is what you&#39;re going to get the key is price is what you pay values what you get price is what you pay values what you get price is what you pay values what you&#39;re going to get as I always talk about price is what you pay value is what you get get price is what you pay value is what you get uh\n\n### HEADLINES_AND_NEWS\nI think this is a negotiating tactic Sean as we saw from Trump 1.0 people are worried about inflation the prices of goods going up except for the fact that inflation under Trump 1.0 was 1.9% on average uh right now China is running a trade surplus at a record high of 957 billion and the impact of any tariffs if they do go through uh is lessened by the fact that the Yuan has valued over 5% in the last few months against the dollar very similar to what happened after the 2016 election before the 2017 inauguration so there&#39;s a lot of knee-jerk reactions here Sean it may prove to be over overblown particularly when you have a president offering one of the longest Olive branches in diplomatic history to president Xi Jinping inviting him to attend the inauguration and I would say if president G Jinping is serious about recovering the Chinese economy he should accept that Olive Branch and come and negotiate and make a good business deal for China make a good business deal for America and move forward with economic Prosperity Thomas there&#39;s also no question that Trump has played hard ball not just with China but with Canada and Mexico as well and whether or not this goes through people are planning on it if you look at the amount of goods that came through the port in just the last month out in Los Angeles this shows that people are buying now so what should Americans perhaps plan on buying now ahead of a tariff implementation I think if you make a decision an emotional decision based on a knee-jerk reaction to headlines  I think you&#39;re you&#39;re doing yourself a disservice because that money could compound invested and uh you know if you&#39;re not taking it out out of the stock market you don&#39;t pay pay taxes so uh you know if the worst case scenario happened and as it relates to other countries other than China and including China this is all predominantly about fairness and reciprocity so if Canada taxes us 10% on X we&#39;re going to tax them 10% on y uh Etc so you know phones they estimate could go up as much as 26% vacuums as much as 19% gaming as much as 40% shoes as much as 14% but you have to put this in perspective Sean we have the lowest percent of Duties collected as a percentage of total Imports in over a 100 years it&#39;s 3% of Duties on total Imports uh if you go all the way back first of all this is lower than it was under Clinton it&#39;s lower than it was under Carter it&#39;s lower than it was under JFK not by a little by a lot and for all the people worried about hoot uh uh Smoot Holly tariffs in 1929 caused the Great Depression at the Spanish Flu in 1918 5% was the total duties collected we&#39;re at 3% Now That Grew From 5% to 177% before Holly Smoot so 12 years of economic Prosperity before it hit a crescendo so we have to be careful I think this is a a starting point to bring people to the table a lot of people have come to the table at maralago to meet with President Trump uh Trudeau came down to to meet the president of Mexico called so let&#39;s see what gin ping does maybe he will accept the invitation we will have a very promising uh economically prosperous mutually beneficial relationship moving forward well but but Trump has also followed through with this in the past so let&#39;s talk about how tariffs could contribute to inflation many Americans are just fed up with inflation that probably cost the Biden Or democrats uh the election if you listen to what experts are saying so is Trump using this as a threat to Simply get what he wants what&#39;s behind this well it&#39;s part of it look in Trump 1.0 you had 30 to 50% tariffs placed on washing machines you had 25% tariffs placed on steel you had 10% tariffs placed on aluminum you had uh 4% of 4.1% of total tariffs were impacted by the tariffs he implemented in 2018 and yet the average inflation rate was 1.9% during his his term so some of this gets offset by currency some of it never happens it&#39;s overblown but we do have to keep in mind as it relates to what he&#39;s negotiating a lot of this has to do with border security and fentol trafficking he&#39;s saying stop the fentanyl or I&#39;m going to tariff you yeah but China has but China has actually said that they will work with the United States on fentanyl that&#39;s one thing that they&#39;ve said time and time again they they they are starting to do that but they have said it and it has not been the case in the previous four years it is now beginning and that&#39;s a positive constructive step that will go a long way and probably has something to do with the olive branch that was extended to attend the inauguration which I think president X should take him up on it&#39;s going to be interesting my friend Thomas thank you so much I really appreciate your Insight thanks again thank you Sean okay and then on to another topic I had the pleasure to join Neil the great Neil Cavuto yesterday and we covered everything uh from rotation to healthc care you want to pay close attention to what I say about health care and the analogy to 2016 2017 and its relative trading performance and keeping things simple so thanks to Jenna D tomases and the great Neil Cavuto for having me on we&#39;ll listen in here my favorite guests\n\n### TECHNICAL_CHARTS\nhere is  the mlen oscillator again these are areas that you get bounces not uh you can go further but um the risk reward starts to get interesting then you have the health care sector this is going to be the most important chart that we cover this week the lowest relative performance of healthc care to the S&amp;P since the 2008 lows uh so that is uh and that was a generational buy opportunity we'll talk about that this is election year seasonal composite so what did we see here we got some uh move higher early December some hard chop in the middle of December and then after the 21st straight up Santa comes to town it wouldn't shock me if that it if that turns out to be correct uh so let's see if this if this holds this is since 1928 this normal mid December uh chop is pretty pretty darn normal until the 21st so we're at the 19th so maybe tomorrow's week again and Monday uh mix and then maybe we get a little turnaround Tuesday action reason this chart keeps repeating is I think there was an accidentally a header uh put into the mix when um when I was putting this all together so we'll just ignore it uh Bull and Bear indicator is not at an extreme so we you know keep it in mind this is from heartnet uh the contrarian view The Price is Right uh oh he's talking about eight shares out perform the S&P in 2024 you China Trade Surplus just hit a record high at 957 billion China share of global car production up 1% to almost 40% the past 20 years\n### HEADLINES_AND_NEWS\nhere is  Trump wants growth not inflation and if consensus too fearful of q1 tariffs China stock set to outperform more entry point for international inq1 so har Net's making a big call it's time to buy China stocks uh China Financial conditions are the easiest since June of 20 that was right after the covid lows we know the big rally we got into 2022 and when when was the last time that China conditions and people don't realize how how easy conditions are in China because it feels like there's a new headline every day they cut this ratio they cut this interest rate they do this half stimulus and they do all this stuff but it's adding up ladies and gentlemen and it's adding up to the point where you get massive rallies let's just take a look at the last three times that Financial conditions were this easy in China what happened so uh May 2020 and all I really care about is Baba so let's just do that um okay so you had May 2020 uh that shot up the from 190 to 312 in less than a year and then prior to that the last time Financial conditions were that easy was November 2016 that's right here ladies and gentlemen which by the way this is the analog that we've been using here let me just show you for the new listeners um this is really interesting how a lot of these things are linking together doesn't mean they'll work perfectly but it does mean that history does tend to rhyme take a look here okay so November 2016 is right here that is the last time you had Financial conditions this easy we covered May 20th so that was like a huge move 100 points in in less than a year but going back here it's interesting you're seeing the conditions exactly the same thing you have this break and then this lower low and November 16 is when Trump got elected so like right now you had Bob is starting to get uh recovered then Trump got elected you were down for a few months down for a few months and then at the turn of the thing so straight up from 855 to 200 and change in just about a exactly a year 85 to 20 84 to 207 uh and it's very interesting because Bob is recovering off these lows just like it was Trump gets elected 3 months down we're in the third month down and then straight up for 12 months so doesn't have to repeat but conditions are very similar and now that you can see it empirically that Financial conditions uh this is uh average of percentile ranks of China 10year government bond yield R&B and oil price since 2010 and when you get to that and then let's go back to 200 10 you can't see Alibaba wasn't there but let's just see uh hang sang going back to that so you can just see that this is a regular occurrence 2010 so you you had some strength there as well so here's 2016 straight up and now here we are in December of 2024 and uh maybe the other one wasn't the most important chart this is probably the most important chart that we're going to cover until we get to the next most important chart China T China Trade Surplus at record high 957 billion uh then we've got China equities the biggest inflow in nine weeks that was from last week so you got that and then S&P is skewed by expensive Mega caps the average stock trades near a record discount to the index greater than one standard deviation below average average that is a big deal ladies and gentlemen and when's the last time we saw that our favorite year 20012 2002 which set the stage for emerging markets and international to outperform along with small caps uh gap between cheap and expensive stocks is wide I mean this extreme is becoming severe and um if AI is going to be as great as everyone is expecting it's just going to take longer like it always does just like Amazon is as great as everyone was expeced from 95 to to 2000 except it dropped 90% before over the next 15 years it became as great as everyone expected and the same thing's going to happen with a lot of these AI stocks and everything else uh value trades at a discount PE so again you got to go back to 20012 2002 this is just setting up perfectly same on Price to Book same on price to sales it's all there ladies and gentlemen and if you don't take advantage of aberrational periods like this and load the boat uh and by the way you should do whatever you're going to do I'm just telling you how I think go to hedge fund tips.com click on terms this is opinion not advice uh as always but um this is how big money made here's what we saw we got to December everyone's smiling so wide we could even been out of sideways and then guess what uh you have this uh equal weight gets smashed for the first half of the month and just like it did in the end of October and just like it did at the beginning of September and just like it did at the beginning of August and then it always bounces back so all our stocks are coming back they'll be back and um and that's the story so but this is just a normal weird rotation that just keeps happening it happened this last time Trump got elected as well uh moving on this is the 10-day Advance decline line you can see it's oversold here due for a bounce this is the net NASDAQ uh ncy mlen oscillator again these are areas that you get bounces from uh and we got there last night uh\n\nFinancial conditions got these easiest these easy this easy see what happened uh 3 months later and a year later and 2 years later and you will be smiling so wide you could eat a banana sideways um number of protests is is up this is further pressure for them to take action uh market cap of The Magnificent 7 as a share of the total index I mean this is crazy town ladies and gentlemen you can see it and you can um decide if you want to continue to play on the skinny branches uh wave of stronger productivity growth starting this is great for manufacturing the global economy for people at the lower levels of income are going to start to benefit from this this is what keeps the economy humming along uh pretty exciting to see that tariffs we&#39;ve covered a million times at 100 200e plus lows everyone&#39;s saying we&#39;re going to start a trade war and we&#39;re going to go into a depression except we started in 1918 at 5% went to 18% before Holly Smoot and um and that&#39;s that so beware of the people who are speaking emotionally and unburdened by the facts they will lead you astray 10year yield so it&#39;s up against this trend line again probably poke through just to mess with everyone this will roll back over this is the this is Trump 1.0 is the same as Trump 2.0 it&#39;s just crazy town until the calendar flips and the inauguration so deal with it on the bonds deal with it on the uh dollar we bought some TLT yesterday and we&#39;ll leave it at that equal weight so here we go the midcaps came down to this trend line or whatever they call it uh small caps came down so you know whether you&#39;re buying it down at the red line or you&#39;re buying it here it really doesn&#39;t make any difference in the scheme of things uh industrial so you can just see some of these sell-offs semiconductors uh here&#39;s Pharma this is part of the healthcare theme we&#39;re going to be talking about along with biotech which we own ### QUOTES_OF_THE_WEEK\nWarren Buffett great investment opportunities come around when excellent companies are surrounded by unusual circumstances that cause the stock to be Mis appraised this is The Credo for great Hill Capital this is all we do this is our knitting we don&#39;t Veer as I said a couple weeks ago when God handed out fomo jeans he he skipped Tom Hayes I I you know there&#39;s so many ways to make money I do not get fear of loss when people are making lots of money in short period of time doing other things I just love what we do I can sleep well at night and I know over time with low leverage we can outperform materially over uh reasonable amounts of time Ben Graham the intelligent investor is a realist who sells to The Optimist and buys from the pessimist that&#39;s what we do and Charlie Monger great investing requires a lot of delayed gratification the beauty is usually the more delayed it is the greater the gratification you get uh and that&#39;s the other thing that most people don&#39;t understand a great example is when he did byd the Chinese thing he got warrant to put I think it was like two or 300 million in birkshire money in it had 3 50 to 80% draw Downs over a decade did nothing and then was like a 12 bagger in 12 months from you know 2000 to 2002 so the irr turned out to be just fine and they were patient and did the thing Bill gross the market can move for irrational reasons and you have to be prepared for that you need to make big bets when the odds are in your favor but not big enough to ruin you but big enough to make a difference and we always say that anytime we put a position on regardless of how slam dunk it is we always account for what you don&#39;t know that you don&#39;t know if this position ever went to zero uh would they carry us out on a stretcher and the answer always has to be no the second question we always ask is if we were to walk into the boardroom of this company and offer to buy the entire company financed by JP Morgan we would be the equity uh at the current market price would they call security to have us escort it out because we were offering a ridiculously low price the answer has to be yes and that&#39;s why I stick in public markets because private markets will never offer you the type of irrational de uh pricing on the downside and on the upside uh that you could never ever experience in the in the private markets because uh people would look at it rationally and uh for some reason in public markets they look at Price movement and they think it tells them something when they should be looking at financials as if they were buying a normal business it&#39;s just it&#39;s basically private equity in the public markets and no one does it we do it we love it and we&#39;ll always do it so that&#39;s that ### HEADLINES_AND_NEWS\nBoeing uh commits $1 billion to

the relative performance of healthcare to the SNP at the lowest level since the uh great financial crisis lows and here&#39;s what I wrote late last night which was uh well first move wrong move question mark and I saidwell just when I thought I was done with the article of the week chair Powell hosted the FED presser and made things interesting I&#39;ve been doing this for a while and have come out several times after fed meetings saying quote the first move is often the wrong move I think it may apply once again but could take a few days to play out this afternoon felt I wrote this uh just after the close this afternoon felt either a like a fund blew up or margin clerks were taking a bunch of dumb overleveraged money out to the Woodshed to put them out of their misery tell me how you really feel Tom we used the opportunity to top up positions across the board end of day and after hours this is not to say we got the last tick as I&#39;m sure we will see some retail selling in the morning as well but in selective spots we bought the margin of safety is so large that the downside is limited I live for days like this I got to tell you I do live for days like that I don&#39;t I do not think this is a December 2018 when Powell said um Powell said that um we&#39;re going to put it on autopilot and he tanked the market 20% right before Christmas uh as we&#39;ve been saying on the podcast not to expect more than one to2 Cuts in 2025 today the FED confirmed it with their Dot Plot and S summary of economic projections if you&#39;re wondering what drove the markets crazy it was this little green circle so uh they took the September projection uh the September projection was the FED funds rate would be down to 3.4 which would be accommodative uh it&#39;s estimated that the neutral rate is 3.5 now they took it up to 39 so they effectively to took two cuts off the table for 2025 neutral rates are estimated at 3.5 level which fed is neither restrictive nor accommodative this implies that the FED will remain somewhat restrictive in 2025 but does not guarantee it it was not surprising to us but apparently it was to those who are levered long in momo stocks and shiny objects so when the fundamentals are irrelevant due to structural Force selling I looked to some technicals to see when the bleeding might begin to coagulate I found a number of indications that we could be nearing that point and others that were mixed leading me to think it could be a couple Day event uh but not a couple week event hence accepting imperfection and beginning to take Vantage of opportunity where it makes amazing sense in the intermediate and long term here&#39;s some of what I&#39;m paying attention to at the moment so here&#39;s the nicey 10% volume index again these are levels where you usually get bounces uh DOW swanland trading oscillator volume again this is pretty extreme uh pring Emerging Market diffusion indicator again where you tend to get uh bounces or near bottoms uh then you got the material stocks o the 10 20-day moving average uh it&#39;s down to zero so if you don&#39;t have any material stocks this is the time to be having material stocks we have albaro um and kind of you could kind of count com stock in that bucket but not really uh same thing with healthc care stocks above the 10 20 day exponential moving average down to 6% again you get down to these levels you get massive bounces historically the NASDAQ Advanced decline issues down to -3000 this is where you get bounces uh NASDAQ mclen oscillator here again down to levels where you get bounces same with the niky mlen oscillator levels where you get big bounces uh and then",

the studios were that&#39;s with Kristen Scher that&#39;s where we did the interview overlooking the New York Stock Exchange so that was a fun experience\n\n### MEDIA_APPEARANCE_RECAP\nwe&#39;re back and then on to the media I had the pleasure to join the great Stewart Varney on Friday where we talked vfc PayPal and some interesting Market stuff uh so we&#39;re I want to thank Christian dagger and Preston miselle for having me on as well as Stuart vanney of course we&#39;re going to listen in now much more than that but now we&#39;re up 110 points about a half percentage points Thomas uh Tom Hayes joins us this morning uh to cover the markets for us Tom it looks like we&#39;re going to get a corporate tax cut and with any luck we&#39;ll get a corporate tax cut if we get it what kind of gain would that imply for the stock market well steu if the corporate tax rate comes down from 21% to 15% it would increase S&P 500 earnings by 4% meaning estimates for next year would go from 275 to 286 which is a big deal the sectors that would have the greatest benefit is consumer discretionary earnings would go up 6.8% Health Care would go up 4.3% Industrials would go up 4.3% why this is important is we&#39;re going to see a broadening in participation the 493 are going to do well correlations of stocks are at a 23-year low it&#39;s going to be a stock Pickers Market in 2025 still I don&#39;t understand that the correlation of stocks is at a multi-year low explain that so we went through a period of time when it was risk on risk off the market went up everything went up the market went down everything went down so you were rewarded for just owning the indices next year with correlations so low the UNM magnificent 493 there are going to be pockets of opportunity even if the indices are up 8 10 12% more subdued than this year those companies like in consumer discretionary like in healthcare like indust that didn&#39;t do quite as well are now going to start to participate because not everything is going to move up and down in the exact same way even if tech is more subdued you can find opportunities in Industrials Healthcare and so on we want you to do a

FEATURED_COMPANY_DEEP_DIVES\nhere is  it now and where do you think it&#39;s going it&#39;s at 21 now uh it&#39;s up about 40% since we brought it to the network and the whole story here Sue is the new CEO Brack and Daryl has turned this company around he sold Supreme he delevered the balance sheet got $1.5 billion of cash they&#39;re doing a collaboration Northface with skims with Kim Kardashian it&#39;s off the charts Vans is turning around this stock is going to double over the next two years and then it could go up from there Brack and Daryl&#39;s a proven winner had a 35 bagger at litech uh You&#39; got to deal with PayPal real fast you got 307 seconds you brought it to us at 67 it&#39;s now at 90 where&#39;s it going it&#39;s up 35% it&#39;s going to push over 100 then it goes to 150 this is another bet on the jockey new CEO Alex Chris came from into it where the stock had a 35 bagger uh he has generated six billion of cash flow $6 billion dollar of BuyBacks he&#39;s improving margins he&#39;s improving take rate their checkout fast lane has increased conversion from 50% to 80% this thing is going to hum over 100 over 150 over the next couple years we love PayPal okay VF and PayPal we&#39;ll check them out thanks very much Tom good to see you have a great weekend and we&#39;re back and then I had a chance to join Kristen Scher live from the New York Stock Exchange on Monday morning and want to thank Jeff Cohen obviously Kristen Scher and Melissa Montanas for having me on we listen in here all right we are off to the races the stock market officially open for trade in one of the final weeks of 2024 what a run and spin for the major indexes the S&P up about 27% I do want to bring in my guest to talk more about markets Thomas Hayes chaired managing member at Great Hill Capital uh Thomas always great to see you especially as we get set to rep what has been a very eventful year yeah no question about it they&#39;re excited down there and they have every right to be because I think we&#39;re in the period Kristen where seasonality is becoming favorable we just got through tax loss selling season we saw some weakness there the last week people were getting nervous little bit of anxiety about the FED meeting this week but it looks like for sure they&#39;re going to be cutting 95% plus odds of a cut this week so as we move out of tax law selling season guess what comes to town I think we&#39;re moving towards the Santa Claus rally a little bit of strength into year end despite having such strength all year long yeah it has been a lot of strength that we&#39;ve seen here and expectations I I would say are pretty high for 2025 how does that set us up in the markets yeah I think one of the things that is critical that&#39;s happening right now is the global easing cycle we&#39;ve had 64 fed Cuts so far this year another one on tap hopefully this week and that is the most amount of easing that we&#39;ve seen since 2020 and 2009 so while it feels toppy those were periods when you wanted to be a buyer of stocks not a seller of stocks but I do think it&#39;s going to be nuanced moving forward as a matter of fact when we look at correlations of individual stocks going back to 2001 correlations are now at the lowest level and what what that voted vote well for was not a continuation of tech which you saw into 2000 but actually a wide broadening uh in in our case right now the unmagnify and what you saw in 2001 to 2007 small caps started to dramatically outperform and believe it or not eming markets which no one is positioned for no one&#39;s interested in it&#39;s American exceptionalism no one wants those stocks but if you go back to Trump one oh they did quite well interesting so you seem to be optimistic on Emerging Markets is that the case Thomas I think I think you want to have some xus I think you want have some Emerging Markets I think you want to have some non- us and I think uh the US will continue to do fine I think we have to have a little bit slightly more subdude expectations you know we&#39;re not not necessarily going to get 27% two two years in a row or plus 20 23 years in a row but I think it&#39;ll be okay uh I do think you&#39;ll see some moderation in the heaviest weights in the S&P 500 which will weigh on the indices so 2025 stock Pickers Market if you&#39;re in the indices you&#39;re going to be okay you&#39;re not going to be thrown parties but 8 10 12% you&#39;re happy uh underneath the surface you can make a tremendous amount of money in that type of environment that&#39;s where stock picking fundamental analysis really come to Bear let&#39;s talk about some of the sectors um as well as perhaps some of the stocks on your radar yeah uh I think it&#39;s time for xbi I know we&#39;ve been on together I&#39;ve talked about biotech well they\n\ndeals FTC is going to be much more favorable with mergers and acquisition and drugs FDA is going to be putting things out more aggressively couple that with the fact that large Pharma has more cash on the balance sheet than they&#39;ve had in decades and they have a lot of drugs coming off a patent so they have it&#39;s much easier to buy Innovation at low valuations historically low valuations in the biotech SE sector then build it from scratch which takes a lot of time so we like biotech M what does this mean for volatility uh that&#39;s a good question moving forward look we&#39;re at very compressed volatility right now uh historically what you see is strength into an inauguration and then afterwards it gets a little choppy so it wouldn&#39;t shock me if we got a little bit of volatility late January early February normal pullbacks 5 10% type of pullbacks uh and then a modestly good year for the overall indices next year interesting and in terms of the new administration of course we saw the president elect here at the stock exchange on Thursday as well as many different members of his cabinet how is that shaping your investment thesis Thomas you know it&#39;s it&#39;s Pro business it&#39;s uh let Animal Spirits run it&#39;s uh deregulation this is a very positive thing uh we want to be in those companies that have actually been beaten down you know one of the companies we like which you can&#39;t give it away right now is called VF Corp okay Brack and Daryl is the new CEO for the last year he came from Logitech at Logitech he took a stock that was down 82% and created a 25 bagger in 8 years he&#39;s doing the exact same thing he&#39;s taking solvency risk off the table by selling Supreme paying that 1.5 billion dollars of debt he&#39;s got the new collaboration with Kim Kardashian North Face and skims that&#39;s going Vans is stabilizing Timberland is a solid brand and Dickies will do okay so we definitely are betting on Brack and Daryl\n### MEDIA_APPEARANCE_RECAP\nhere is  Bitcoin on your radar uh it&#39;s not I&#39;m an equity manager uh Kudos are a lot of ways to make money for me that&#39;s not one of them but uh I&#39;ve got a lot of friends that have done extremely well in the crypto space very quickly in just about 20 seconds Thomas anything you want to hear in particular that will shape your thesis from the FED chare on Wednesday you know it it wouldn&#39;t number one I think he&#39;s got to acknowledge that he&#39;s still in an aggressively restrictive stance number one and number two it really wouldn&#39;t surprise me if he does pause for a while and I and I hope the Mark I I think the market is prepared for that get that that cut in he front loaded a lot of cuts and then maybe see what happens for the next few months before you get too aggressively let&#39;s watch the inflation numbers uh but I think maybe one maybe two cuts may be all that&#39;s needed in 2025 after this all right Thomas Hayes chair and managing member of great Hill Capital Thomas always a pleasure thanks so much thanks for having me Kristen and we&#39;re back and then I had the chance on Monday night to join sha calebs on cgtn America to talk China or Trump G relations uh pretty aggressive stance on a Chinese station but uh I think it&#39;s moving in the right direction and appre appreciate sha and Camelia Kellan for having me on enjoyed speaking with Shawn as always Los Angeles okay for a deeper dive into the impact of potential tariffs from Donald Trump let&#39;s talk with Thomas Hayes he the founder chairman and managing member of great Hill Capital Thomas always a pleasure good to see you again my friend thank you for having me Sean okay so How likely are we to see price hikes on everyday products and again we are presuming that this actually goes through correct I think this is a negotiating tactic Sean as we saw from Trump 1.0 people are worried about inflation the prices of goods going up except for the fact that inflation under Trump 1.0 was 1.9% on average uh right now China is running a trade surplus at a record high of 957 billion and the impact of any tariffs if they do go through uh is lessened by the fact that the Yuan has valued over 5% in the last few months against the dollar very similar to what happened after the 2016 election before the 2017 inauguration so there&#39;s a lot of knee-jerk reactions here Sean it may prove to be over overblown particularly when you have a president offering one of the longest Olive branches in diplomatic history to president Xi Jinping inviting him to attend the inauguration and I would say if president G Jinping is serious about recovering the Chinese economy he should accept that Olive Branch and come and negotiate and make a good business deal for China make a good business deal for America and move forward with economic Prosperity Thomas there&#39;s also no question that Trump has played hard ball not just with China but with Canada and Mexico as well and whether or not this goes through people are planning on it if you look at the amount of goods that came through the port in just the last month out in Los Angeles this shows that people are buying now so what should Americans perhaps plan on buying now ahead of a tariff implementation I think if you make a decision an emotional decision based on a knee-jerk reaction to\n\nlet&#39;s talk about how tariffs could contribute to inflation many Americans are just fed up with inflation that probably cost the Biden Or democrats uh the election if you listen to what experts are saying so is Trump using this as a threat to Simply get what he wants what&#39;s behind this well it&#39;s part of it look in Trump 1.0 you had 30 to 50% tariffs placed on washing machines you had 25% tariffs placed on steel you had 10% tariffs placed on aluminum you had uh 4% of 4.1% of total tariffs were impacted by the tariffs he implemented in 2018 and yet the average inflation rate was 1.9% during his his term so some of this gets offset by currency some of it never happens it&#39;s overblown but we do have to keep in mind as it relates to what he&#39;s negotiating a lot of this has to do with border security and fentol trafficking he&#39;s saying stop the fentanyl or I&#39;m going to tariff you yeah but China has but China has actually said that they will work with the United States on fentanyl that&#39;s one thing that they&#39;ve said time and time again they they they are starting to do that but they have said it and it has not been the case in the previous four years it is now beginning and that&#39;s a positive constructive step that will go a long way and probably has something to do with the olive branch that was extended to attend the inauguration which I think president X should take him up on it&#39;s going to be interesting ### MEDIA_APPEARANCE_RECAP\nI had the pleasure to join Neil the great Neil Cavuto yesterday and we covered everything uh from rotation to healthc care you want to pay close attention to what I say about health care and the analogy to 2016 2017 and its relative trading performance and keeping things simple so thanks to Jenna D tomases and the great Neil Cavuto for having me on we&#39;ll listen in here\n\nwe're seeing it a little bit in the dollar store stocks and their earnings results Etc Walmart has brought down some of the the middle inome people to spend in their stores so Walmart's still doing well but Dollar General Dollar Tree have struggled a little bit but I think it's going to get better as that sentiment comes back the jobs stay healthy and uh and Trump helps that was the demographic that did really well under Trump 1.0 so stay tuned okay we're looking at 2025 look across the spectrum of all the stocks that you follow and all the stocks that you like give me one that you think is going to do really really well in 2025 what is it you're asking me for my favorite child but uh I'll give you one uh it's called Etsy this was a covid darling the stock is down 80% it's the fourth most trafficked e-commerce site behind Amazon eBay and Walmart most people don't know that you can only get things on etay that that you can't get anywhere else so it's not a race to the bottom they're still generating over over $600 million of free cash flow and that's starting to re accelerate they just announced a$1 billion buyback they've got loyalty programs gifting programs they're focused on International growth and bringing men into the fold so if you want to do the minimum just scattershot everyone chocolates that they're never going to eat for Christmas if you want to make them feel special get them something on eBay with their name on it they'll never forget that gift and that's why we like eBay you could move the market with that Rec that was very strong young man very strong\n### MEDIA_APPEARANCE_RECAP\nwhat's important is despite what happened yesterday everything that we covered in those videos which covers my total comprehensive Outlook right now um applies okay and we're going to talk about yesterday's flush and um how we're thinking about things moving forward it'll be a little bumpy ride when you get that type of a uh push down but you know we we try to just burden ourselves with the facts be dispassionate about things and uh pick our spots looking at some of these charts these are some of the indicators we're going to cover more in the article of the week you look at pmo buy all it's not quite down to zero so we could have a little bit more pain uh pmo by SPX is closer to areas where you see recoveries obviously active managers got over their skis all in the same stocks those got hit the hardest yesterday uh the put call did Spike up to levels where you usually see a little bit of a back off uh it wouldn't surprise me to see another foe flush just to get out all the weak hands before we bounce back uh but on balance I think we want to uh remain invested through the inauguration and we used the opportunity late yesterday and in after hours to buy some things up at uh at some nice prices and that doesn't mean we got the last tick it just means we took advantage the other thing that I would say is going back to the Trump trade these are the\n\nthey failed so so it&#39;s starting to re accelerate and uh they worked overtime to try to destroy it just like at Intel they&#39;re doing and some of the others but Bo they tried it every day day and night to crush it the stock the Stock&#39;s now going up every single day even in a weak Market uh which is exciting to see and what&#39;s more exciting is no one&#39;s talking about it which makes me extra happy uh that&#39;s one of our biggest positions uh so free cash flow is positive it&#39;s down yes but uh if you listen to the conference call you&#39;ll see all the great things but these are the two key things I want to see in a turnaround is improving balance sheet solvency risk off the table through asset sales and free cash flows positive that gives them the runway for operating improvements to take cold and that&#39;s why you get the doubles and triples and you sleep like a baby at night cuz you&#39;re buying businesses with long-term operating history that have shown that they have a durable sustainable moat and that&#39;s why we&#39;re looking at 30 years of data here uh actually not 30 years we&#39;re looking at uh 25 + 15 so almost 40 Years of data and you&#39;ll you&#39;ll they&#39;ll be here for another 40 years so um so that&#39;s the story here on balance margins have been good they&#39;re a little compressed but they&#39;re they&#39;ve got the plan to move forward uh the analyst that I I cited\n### MEDIA_APPEARANCE_RECAP\nhere is  talking about margin expansion moving forward and why it was compressed so everything in good stead on Tuesday we put out a summary of the monthly Bank of America Global fund manager survey this month they surveyed uh 400 managers with 450 billion under management here were the key points number one most bullish Catalyst for 2025 could be China growth accelerates we agree uh no one wants Healthcare materials or energy opportunity to be had for sure in materials and Healthcare energy uh on the look we love our com stock we&#39;re going to stick with it um we&#39;re keeping an open mind but but a lot of them haven&#39;t gotten cheap enough for us to get excited uh best performing Equity index of 2025 people are looking to so some small caps and starting to look to China so that&#39;s a positive thing uh a little bit of love in 2020 managers seeing some potential for that uh global economy again improving sentiment but not extreme sentiment so that&#39;s a good thing to see and then uh Global profit expectations again elevated like you see off big trough lows uh but not extreme yet so I think there&#39;s some run Runway there certainly through the inauguration and we should get a garden variety pullback is is our best guess uh and then Cooper standard update this was exciting to see thanks to my buddy Allen for sending it over uh perfectly on track here nothing more to add uh and",
    "QUOTES_OF_THE_WEEK": "\n\n### QUOTES_OF_THE_WEEK\ndown to business  they don&#39;t give away multi baggers for free we continue to burden ourselves with the facts down 41% you can&#39;t give it away if the secret to happiness in life is low expectations know what you own smiling so wide you could eat banana sideways price is what you pay value is what you&#39;re going to get we don&#39;t buy up when the facts change you can change your mind I want you to see how opinion follows Trend opinion follows Trend opinion follows Trend opinion follows Trend opinion follows the trend opinion follows Trend opinion follows Trend opinion follows Trend opinion follows Trend opinion follows Trend so again opinion follows Trend my favorite saying op opinion follows Trend you can&#39;t give the stock away you can&#39;t give them away can buy it a 71% discount and they can&#39;t give it away you can&#39;t give them away you can&#39;t give them away 163 million you can&#39;t give it away also 2000 breaking out to all-time highs couldn&#39;t give it away can&#39;t give away the communication sectors you can&#39;t give away reads you can&#39;t give away PayPal but now they&#39;re coming along they&#39;re going to chase all the way up you know what you want and you know why you want it Disney just made a marginal new low oh cuz they don&#39;t know what they own makes absolutely no difference if you know what you own you don&#39;t know what you own just don&#39;t dump it in the hole many people are shaking out of great stocks due to bad\n\nFinancial conditions got these easiest these easy this easy see what happened uh 3 months later and a year later and 2 years later and you will be smiling so wide you could eat a banana sideways um number of protests is is up this is further pressure for them to take action uh market cap of The Magnificent 7 as a share of the total index I mean this is crazy town ladies and gentlemen you can see it and you can um decide if you want to continue to play on the skinny branches uh wave of stronger productivity growth starting this is great for manufacturing the global economy for people at the lower levels of income are going to start to benefit from this this is what keeps the economy humming along uh pretty exciting to see that tariffs we&#39;ve covered a million times at 100 200e plus lows everyone&#39;s saying we&#39;re going to start a trade war and we&#39;re going to go into a depression except we started in 1918 at 5% went to 18% before Holly Smoot and um and that&#39;s that so beware of the people who are speaking emotionally and unburdened by the facts they will lead you astray 10year yield so it&#39;s up against this trend line again probably poke through just to mess with everyone this will roll back over this is the this is Trump 1.0 is the same as Trump 2.0 it&#39;s just crazy town until the calendar flips and the inauguration so deal with it on the bonds deal with it on the uh dollar we bought some TLT yesterday and we&#39;ll leave it at that equal weight so here we go the midcaps came down to this trend line or whatever they call it uh small caps came down so you know whether you&#39;re buying it down at the red line or you&#39;re buying it here it really doesn&#39;t make any difference in the scheme of things uh industrial so you can just see some of these sell-offs semiconductors uh here&#39;s Pharma this is part of the healthcare theme we&#39;re going to be talking about along with biotech which we own ### QUOTES_OF_THE_WEEK\nWarren Buffett great investment opportunities come around when excellent companies are surrounded by unusual circumstances that cause the stock to be Mis appraised this is The Credo for great Hill Capital this is all we do this is our knitting we don&#39;t Veer as I said a couple weeks ago when God handed out fomo jeans he he skipped Tom Hayes I I you know there&#39;s so many ways to make money I do not get fear of loss when people are making lots of money in short period of time doing other things I just love what we do I can sleep well at night and I know over time with low leverage we can outperform materially over uh reasonable amounts of time Ben Graham the intelligent investor is a realist who sells to The Optimist and buys from the pessimist that&#39;s what we do and Charlie Monger great investing requires a lot of delayed gratification the beauty is usually the more delayed it is the greater the gratification you get uh and that&#39;s the other thing that most people don&#39;t understand a great example is when he did byd the Chinese thing he got warrant to put I think it was like two or 300 million in birkshire money in it had 3 50 to 80% draw Downs over a decade did nothing and then was like a 12 bagger in 12 months from you know 2000 to 2002 so the irr turned out to be just fine and they were patient and did the thing Bill gross the market can move for irrational reasons and you have to be prepared for that you need to make big bets when the odds are in your favor but not big enough to ruin you but big enough to make a difference and we always say that anytime we put a position on regardless of how slam dunk it is we always account for what you don&#39;t know that you don&#39;t know if this position ever went to zero uh would they carry us out on a stretcher and the answer always has to be no the second question we always ask is if we were to walk into the boardroom of this company and offer to buy the entire company financed by JP Morgan we would be the equity uh at the current market price would they call security to have us escort it out because we were offering a ridiculously low price the answer has to be yes and that&#39;s why I stick in public markets because private markets will never offer you the type of irrational de uh pricing on the downside and on the upside uh that you could never ever experience in the in the private markets because uh people would look at it rationally and uh for some reason in public markets they look at Price movement and they think it tells them something when they should be looking at financials as if they were buying a normal business it&#39;s just it&#39;s basically private equity in the public markets and no one does it we do it we love it and we&#39;ll always do it so that&#39;s that ###

Barry wrote it fantastic and they say that basically you know they&#39;re being conservative here because they&#39;re putting themselves out in uh period but that&#39;s what makes Barons great

TECHNICAL_CHARTS\nhere is  uh high yield spreads at a record low uh this was the changes in the FED speak so you saw this descent from Beth hammock who was a non-voting member uh and then they added this words in considering the extent and timing of additional adjustments so we know the results you can see the NASDAQ and S&P here just want to make sure I didn&#39;t miss anything after that so you see the pullback here these are kind of normal pullbacks we saw it in September um saw it in July we saw it in March and we also saw that this gets extended stops above the 20-day moving average here&#39;s semiconductors so when you visualize this here&#39;s a vix to C to vix 3mon ratio hasn&#39;t got this High since early August we know that was an Abrupt correction on the uh Bank of Japan hike and then they walked it back and uh it worked here&#39;s Global stimulus fiscal plus monetary impulse uh percentage points of GDP by GDP weighted contribution and there&#39;s just showing that there&#39;s a lot of stimulus moving into the market now and so on so back to this\n### MISCELLANEOUS\nhealthcare left for dead\n\nthe table for 2025 neutral rates are estimated at 3.5 level which fed is neither restrictive nor accommodative this implies that the FED will remain somewhat restrictive in 2025 but does not guarantee it it was not surprising to us but apparently it was to those who are levered long in momo stocks and shiny objects so when the fundamentals are irrelevant due to structural Force selling I looked to some technicals to see when the bleeding might begin to coagulate I found a number of indications that we could be nearing that point and others that were mixed leading me to think it could be a couple Day event uh but not a couple week event hence accepting imperfection and beginning to take Vantage of opportunity where it makes amazing sense in the intermediate and long term here&#39;s some of what I&#39;m paying attention to at the moment so here&#39;s the nicey 10% volume index again these are levels where you usually get bounces uh DOW swanland trading oscillator volume again this is pretty extreme uh pring Emerging Market diffusion indicator again where you tend to get uh bounces or near bottoms uh then you got the material stocks o the 10 20-day moving average uh it&#39;s down to zero so if you don&#39;t have any material stocks this is the time to be having material stocks we have albaro um and kind of you could kind of count com stock in that bucket but not really uh same thing with healthc care stocks above the 10 20 day exponential moving average down to 6% again you get down to these levels you get massive bounces historically the NASDAQ Advanced decline issues down to -3000 this is where you get bounces uh NASDAQ mclen oscillator here again down to levels where you get bounces same with the niky mlen oscillator levels where you get big bounces uh and then finally  the ncy advanced decline volume is the lowest level we&#39;ve seen even more than Co it hit - 4,000 that&#39;s mindboggling uh so many of these are stretched or near levels from which you would normally see a bounce back given my thoughts above nothing changes in Outlook for each of these different interviews which we already went through this is an important chart that we covered last week but again I want to reemphasize that the back drop for stock Pickers is the best in 25 years with correlation of stock performance at alltime lows these are periods when xus and emerging markets and UNM magnificent 493 dramatically outperformed these are these are periods where the concentrated stocks at the time like Cisco and Amazon they all took Corrections even though ultimately the thesis were right the valuation and timing was wrong um valuation too high in certain Pockets so you can see here S&amp;P price to book ratio now exceeds March 2000 high again do I want to take that bet and say this time is different the answer is no there&#39;s too much other stuff to do that I don&#39;t have to wake up at night and uh check check the Futures overnight and sleep with my eyes open uh two picks bet on jockeys plus one sector pick we covered VF PayPal xbi covered the uh G Trump relationship covered Etsy and covered uh Boeing Disney why healthc care is not dead the rumors of My Demise have been greatly exaggerated we talked about 62 of the 500 components in the S&amp;P being Healthcare uh we&#39;re down about 20% on average each that&#39;s crazy town with the market all alltime highs that&#39;s where I sniff out opportunity last time you saw that extreme where was 2009 which was a generational opportunity to buy Healthcare and biotech I think you have to be selective but it&#39;s also curious because uh Healthcare is expected to have the second largest earnings growth next year at 21% and you can&#39;t give these stocks away it&#39;s mind-boggling except when you think about oh okay people are worried about RFK just like they were worried about Trump in 2016 and the thing you have to keep in mind is whether they&#39;re Republican or Democrat a lot of them a lot of the uh public servants are bought and paid for by Pharma so we&#39;ll get some stuff done at the margins but it&#39;s not going to be material enough to uh be as bad as the stocks are reflecting is what I&#39;m saying and you could see here uh healthc care got smashed after the election and then after the inauguration up 40% in the next year and same with biotech we love our xbi smashed after the election up 78% in the next year uh same with medical devices Baxter baby smashed after the election up 50% in the next year and um that&#39;s all you need to know with the theme being deals and drugs FDA and FTC being more lenient and Pharma having a big problem with patent Cliffs and a lot of cash why Baxter is not dead which is a a part of the healthcare sector so I just kind of tried to burden everyone with the facts here you can see here a history of cash flow Rising cash flow falling the last time cash flow got this low was 2016 and then the stock recovered materially from 30 to 86 over the next few years and you can just see throughout history revenues are continued to grow return on capital is a little compressed margins are a little compressed these are normal cyclical things um and then you look technically you&#39;re like this is this is so oversold what&#39;s going on technically and you can see every time you got to these extremes whether it&#39;s RSI stochastics Etc it was a basing period here it took a couple of years it&#39;s been going about year and a half here and then it just starts to go and in this case the next move was a 20 bagger in this case the next move was a 15 bagger and we&#39;ll see what happens here I mean we get into things for doubles and triples over a few years but this this one might be good enough to hold for the long term uh you could see you know certainly cash flows down but uh it&#39;s not out and with the turnaround all we look especially you know with the stock down this materially with a turnaround what we look for is solvency risk is off the table which they just did with selling the assets and paying down debt and um and that free cash flow is positive for the most part or it&#39;s only temporarily negative like was in the case of uh Cooper standard but that was just too we had to get involved when we did otherwise we would have missed the Catalyst and um so this one uh you can go through this but you can see on balance share counts effectively the same it&#39;s down from 2010 it&#39;s up from 2021 uh but not materially and then uh debt they&#39;re going to pay down a bunch of this so you can take that down that was a worry for a little while again solvency risk you can see you can read about their moat in the different parts of their business which we highlighted the important parts we&#39;re not going to go through you you know we&#39;ll be here till uh dinner if we do that uh key key points from the earnings call you can see the revenue is up 4% they&#39;re growing these are all things that are fixable this business is impossible to destroy and um I mean they&#39;ve tried but they they failed so so it&#39;s starting to re accelerate and uh they worked overtime to try to destroy it just like at Intel they&#39;re doing and some of the others but Bo they tried it every day day and night to crush it the stock the Stock&#39;s now going up every single day even in a weak Market uh which is exciting to see and what&#39;s more exciting is no one&#39;s talking about it which makes me extra happy uh that&#39;s one of our biggest positions uh so free cash flow is positive it&#39;s down yes but uh if you listen to the conference call you&#39;ll see all the great things but these are the two key things I want to see in a turnaround is improving balance sheet solvency risk off the table through asset sales and free cash flows positive that gives them the runway for operating improvements to take cold and that&#39;s why you get the doubles and triples and you sleep like a baby at night cuz you&#39;re buying businesses with long-term operating history that have shown that they have a durable sustainable moat and that&#39;s why we&#39;re looking at 30 years of data here uh actually not 30 years we&#39;re looking at uh 25 + 15 so almost 40 Years of data and you&#39;ll you&#39;ll they&#39;ll be here for another 40 years so um so that&#39;s the story here on balance margins have been good they&#39;re a little compressed but they&#39;re they&#39;ve got the plan to move forward uh the analyst that I I cited\n\n### MISCELLANEOUS\ngood things come to those who wait and those who wait longer they the Gratitude is the uh the good things are even better so that&#39;s the story of Cooper standard we very excited to see that stuff fear got flushed out down to 34 could go lower before it goes higher we&#39;ll we&#39;ll take a a watch and see um National Association of active investment managers uh that was uh that was up to 90 and chain let&#39;s just see where it got to I think it was at a peak so we got to curb their enthusiasm and then we will you know it&#39;s amazing if you take the daytime flight from I take it out of John Wayne which is beautiful it&#39;s 1015 minutes from the house um if you take the daytime flight you don&#39;t get jet lag which is pretty awesome uh let&#39;s see here National Association of active investment managers I was always worried about that I lose two days or whatever no hit the ground running all right so is that a 8250 I guess that printed today let&#39;s move to all right we&#39;re cruising along here some of the data GDP came in stronger 3.1 initial jobless claims came in a little bit better than expected Etc so nothing critical there earnings are still holding up 275 for next year mid- teens earnings growth exploration and production earnings down 7.9% top 30 weights in the last 60 days so again they got to the price has to come down a lot for me to get interested uh and then Industrials uh down 2.2% uh let&#39;s see if I&#39;m not M I&#39;m G to guess that&#39;s probably Boeing let&#39;s just see what if there&#39;s one that&#39;s really oh yeah boing there you go so that&#39;s already priced uh that was priced in at the one 40s and 150s and uh and now it&#39;s back at like 180 and on its way so um yeah wow it got down to 137 I mean felt like we had to buy stock every single day and uh and now it&#39;s moving all right so that&#39;s the story let&#39;s get on to\n\nbut I do think it&#39;s turning around and I do think it&#39;s a good product and uh I kind of like it so uh and we&#39;ve covered that a bunch of times it got cheaper so maybe now&#39;s the time to take a punt but like would this be a high conviction I love it I&#39;ve seen so many small Burger chains come and go Burger F uh Habit Burger blah blah blah they&#39;re all public promotes and they just dwindle out and die I think Portillos might be different but Sha desiah covered Pizza already uh J Su Smith by the way for for Papa John&#39;s I think it&#39;ll be fine guys I just I&#39;m just not in love with it jasm Smith uh hi Tom I want to let you know I&#39;m one CPS double away from being your client thanks for your opinion not advice my question is on qxo isn&#39;t there going to be one more delution event when they make the deal shouldn&#39;t that create one more opportunity not necessarily um I I yeah I I mean look it&#39;s just a brad Jacobs premium I want to be involved with this uh when we got in if everything goes perfect in 10 years it&#39;s an 8 to a 10 bagger and if it doesn&#39;t then I probably get out at a double and call it a day but with him things tend to work out Tim D is also asking about Papa John so Everyone likes pap Papa John&#39;s I I don&#39;t think there&#39;s anything wrong with it Hudson Technologies hdsn now this is interesting what do they do let&#39;s see HTS looks like revenues fell off a bit let&#39;s see what they do provision solutions for recurring problems within the refrigeration industry sale of refrigerant and industrial gas yeah this is materials like Dow and all these stocks that are smashed this looks like it should probably be a private company versus a public company I I tend to not play in these type of things what&#39;s the market cap 230 million so look the number one thing you got to figure out here is  why they&#39;ve destroyed sharehold capital for 30 years and why now is different and if you can answer that question then it&#39;s worth doing some real work on and pursuing but when I see a business like this where it&#39;s just been constant Destruction for 30 40 50 years I&#39;m not interested so uh my my best guess\n\ntell me why I&#39;m wrong and tell me what they&#39;ve changed or who they&#39;ve changed and I&#39;m listening but you know revenues are declining meaningfully the last 3 years and uh even though cash flow is still healthy it&#39;s kind of a passero um Jonathan mcky Healthcare earnings expected to grow and I&#39;ve gone into Baxter wondering your thoughts on Mna we&#39;ve covered Mna not for me I don&#39;t I can&#39;t understand their pipeline backer is a little simpler it&#39;s devices easier for me to understand can you take a look at valet I think we&#39;ve looked at it again mining companies they have a tendency to just screw it up no matter how good the conditions are um my guess is what you&#39;re buying it for the dividend what&#39;s the dividend I&#39;m sure it&#39;s got a big dividend and that&#39;s why you&#39;re interested because the Stock&#39;s done nothing for years I mean it&#39;s the stock is been the same for again 20 years like tell me why it&#39;s going to be different the next 20 years it&#39;s a Mining stock all they do is screw things up so all right so you got a 16% dividend yield so that&#39;s why you&#39;re interested let&#39;s just take a quick look to get any sense if that is sustainable usually it&#39;s not so they cashes down from 14 billion down to four and what are they doing here taking down their share count that&#39;s good free cash flows coming down but what is there all right the common Dividends are 5 billion a year and their free cash flow is 4.5 and their balance sheet is showing five billion cash my guess is that unless they hit a mining cycle that dividend is going to get cut um You probably don&#39;t get hurt with the stock it probably bounces back to 15 but it&#39;s not not not what I do I think it&#39;s okay though um and\n\n### MISCELLANEOUS\n\nwith that said let&#39;s see all right that&#39;s that so um\n\n### MISCELLANEOUS\nwith that said we&#39;re going to be back next week same time same place in the meantime make a great let&#39;s try that again we&#39;ll be back next week same time same place in the meantime make it a great one",
    "FEATURED_COMPANY_DEEP_DIVES": "\n\n### MEDIA_APPEARANCE_RECAP\nif the corporate tax rate comes down from 21% to 15% it would increase S&P 500 earnings by 4% meaning estimates for next year would go from 275 to 286 which is a big deal the sectors that would have the greatest benefit is consumer discretionary earnings would go up 6.8% Health Care would go up 4.3% Industrials would go up 4.3% why this is important is we&#39;re going to see a broadening in participation the 493 are going to do well correlations of stocks are at a 23-year low it&#39;s going to be a stock Pickers Market in 2025 still I don&#39;t understand that the correlation of stocks is at a multi-year low explain that so we went through a period of time when it was risk on risk off the market went up everything went up the market went down everything went down so you were rewarded for just owning the indices next year with correlations so low the UNM magnificent 493 there are going to be pockets of opportunity even if the indices are up 8 10 12% more subdued than this year those companies like in consumer discretionary like in healthcare like indust that didn&#39;t do quite as well are now going to start to participate because not everything is going to move up and down in the exact same way even if tech is more subdued you can find opportunities in Industrials Healthcare and so on we want you to do a Victory lap on two stocks that you brought to us first off VF Corporation you brought it to us at 15 w\n### FEATURED_COMPANY_DEEP_DIVES\nhere is  it now and where do you think it&#39;s going it&#39;s at 21 now uh it&#39;s up about 40% since we brought it to the network and the whole story here Sue is the new CEO Brack and Daryl has turned this company around he sold Supreme he delevered the balance sheet got $1.5 billion of cash they&#39;re doing a collaboration Northface with skims with Kim Kardashian it&#39;s off the charts Vans is turning around this stock is going to double over the next two years and then it could go up from there Brack and Daryl&#39;s a proven winner had a 35 bagger at litech uh You&#39; got to deal with PayPal real fast you got 307 seconds you brought it to us at 67 it&#39;s now at 90 where&#39;s it going it&#39;s up 35% it&#39;s going to push over 100 then it goes to 150 this is another bet on the jockey new CEO Alex Chris came from into it where the stock had a 35 bagger uh he has generated six billion of cash flow $6 billion dollar of BuyBacks he&#39;s improving margins he&#39;s improving take rate their checkout fast lane has increased conversion from 50% to 80% this thing is going to hum over 100 over 150 over the next couple years we love PayPal okay VF and PayPal we&#39;ll check them out thanks very much Tom good to see you have a great weekend and we&#39;re back and then I had a chance to join Kristen Scher live from the New York Stock Exchange on Monday morning and want to thank Jeff Cohen obviously Kristen Scher and Melissa Montanas for having me on we listen in here all right we are off to the races the stock market officially open for trade in one of the final weeks of 2024 what a run and spin for the major indexes the S&P up about 27% I do want to bring in my guest to talk more about markets Thomas Hayes chaired managing member at Great Hill Capital uh Thomas always great to see you especially as we get set to rep what has been a very eventful year yeah no question about it they&#39;re excited down there and they have every right to be because I think we&#39;re in the period Kristen where seasonality is becoming favorable we just got through tax loss selling season we saw some weakness there the last week people were getting nervous little bit of anxiety about the FED meeting this week but it looks like for sure they&#39;re going to be cutting 95% plus odds of a cut this week so as we move out of tax law selling season guess what comes to town I think we&#39;re moving towards the Santa Claus rally a little bit of strength into year end despite having such strength all year long yeah it has been a lot of strength that we&#39;ve seen here and expectations I I would say are pretty high for 2025 how does that set us up in the markets yeah I think one of the things that is critical that&#39;s happening right now is the global easing cycle we&#39;ve had 64 fed Cuts so far this year another one on tap hopefully this week and that is the most amount of easing that we&#39;ve seen since 2020 and 2009 so while it feels toppy those were periods when you wanted to be a buyer of stocks not a seller of stocks but I do think it&#39;s going to be nuanced moving forward as a matter of fact when we look at correlations of individual stocks going back to 2001 correlations are now at the lowest level and what what that voted vote well for was not a continuation of tech which you saw into 2000 but actually a wide broadening uh in in our case right now the unmagnify and what you saw in 2001 to 2007 small caps started to dramatically outperform and believe it or not eming markets which no one is positioned for no one&#39;s interested in it&#39;s American exceptionalism no one wants those stocks but if you go back to Trump one oh they did quite well interesting so you seem to be optimistic on Emerging Markets is that the case Thomas I think I think you want to have some xus I think you want have some Emerging Markets I think you want to have some non- us and I think uh the US will continue to do fine I think we have to have a little bit slightly more subdude expectations you know we&#39;re not not necessarily going to get 27% two two years in a row or plus 20 23 years in a row but I think it&#39;ll be okay uh I do think you&#39;ll see some moderation in the heaviest weights in the S&P 500 which will weigh on the indices so 2025 stock Pickers Market if you&#39;re in the indices you&#39;re going to be okay you&#39;re not going to be thrown parties but 8 10 12% you&#39;re happy uh underneath the surface you can make a tremendous amount of money in that type of environment that&#39;s where stock picking fundamental analysis really come to Bear let&#39;s talk about some of the sectors um as well as perhaps some of the stocks on your radar yeah uh I think it&#39;s time for xbi I know we&#39;ve been on together I&#39;ve talked about biotech well they\n\nthat is the most amount of easing that we've seen since 2020 and 2009 so while it feels toppy those were periods when you wanted to be a buyer of stocks not a seller of stocks but I do think it's going to be nuanced moving forward as a matter of fact when we look at correlations of individual stocks going back to 2001 correlations are now at the lowest level and what what that voted vote well for was not a continuation of tech which you saw into 2000 but actually a wide broadening uh in in our case right now the unmagnify and what you saw in 2001 to 2007 small caps started to dramatically outperform and believe it or not eming markets which no one is positioned for no one's interested in it's American exceptionalism no one wants those stocks but if you go back to Trump one oh they did quite well interesting so you seem to be optimistic on Emerging Markets is that the case Thomas I think I think you want to have some xus I think you want have some Emerging Markets I think you want to have some non- us and I think uh the US will continue to do fine I think we have to have a little bit slightly more subdude expectations you know we're not not necessarily going to get 27% two two years in a row or plus 20 23 years in a row but I think it'll be okay uh I do think you'll see some moderation in the heaviest weights in the S&P 500 which will weigh on the indices so 2025 stock Pickers Market if you're in the indices you're going to be okay you're not going to be thrown parties but 8 10 12% you're happy uh underneath the surface you can make a tremendous amount of money in that type of environment that's where stock picking fundamental analysis really come to Bear\n### FEATURED_COMPANY_DEEP_DIVES\nLet's talk about some of the sectors um as well as perhaps some of the stocks on your radar yeah uh I think it's time for xbi I know we've been on together I've talked about biotech well they finally come aggressively off that bottom it's taken a couple years to to consolidate the the uh the losses and now we're at the level where I think the next phase we're going to we're going to start to to move higher I think you've got two things working in favor uh deals and drugs so deals FTC is going to be much more favorable with mergers and acquisition and drugs FDA is going to be putting things out more aggressively couple that with the fact that large Pharma has more cash on the balance sheet than they've had in decades and they have a lot of drugs coming off a patent so they have it's much easier to buy Innovation at low valuations historically low valuations in the biotech SE sector then build it from scratch which takes a lot of time so we like biotech M what does this mean for volatility uh that's a good question moving forward look we're at very compressed volatility right now uh historically what you see is strength into an inauguration and then afterwards it gets a little choppy so it wouldn't shock me if we got a little bit of volatility late January early February normal pullbacks 5 10% type of pullbacks uh and then a modestly good year for the overall indices next year interesting and in terms of the new administration of course we saw the president elect here at the stock exchange on Thursday as well as many different members of his cabinet how is that shaping your investment thesis Thomas you know it's it's Pro business it's uh let Animal Spirits run it's uh deregulation this is a very positive thing uh we want to be in those companies that have actually been beaten down you know one of the companies we like which you can't give it away right now is called VF Corp okay Brack and Daryl is the new CEO for the last year he came from Logitech at Logitech he took a stock that was down 82% and created a 25 bagger in 8 years he's doing the exact same thing he's taking solvency risk off the table by selling Supreme paying that 1.5 billion dollars of debt he's got the new collaboration with Kim Kardashian North Face and skims that's going Vans is stabilizing Timberland is a solid brand and Dickies will do okay so we definitely are betting on Brack and Daryl\n\nthe table for 2025 neutral rates are estimated at 3.5 level which fed is neither restrictive nor accommodative this implies that the FED will remain somewhat restrictive in 2025 but does not guarantee it it was not surprising to us but apparently it was to those who are levered long in momo stocks and shiny objects so when the fundamentals are irrelevant due to structural Force selling I looked to some technicals to see when the bleeding might begin to coagulate I found a number of indications that we could be nearing that point and others that were mixed leading me to think it could be a couple Day event uh but not a couple week event hence accepting imperfection and beginning to take Vantage of opportunity where it makes amazing sense in the intermediate and long term here&#39;s some of what I&#39;m paying attention to at the moment so here&#39;s the nicey 10% volume index again these are levels where you usually get bounces uh DOW swanland trading oscillator volume again this is pretty extreme uh pring Emerging Market diffusion indicator again where you tend to get uh bounces or near bottoms uh then you got the material stocks o the 10 20-day moving average uh it&#39;s down to zero so if you don&#39;t have any material stocks this is the time to be having material stocks we have albaro um and kind of you could kind of count com stock in that bucket but not really uh same thing with healthc care stocks above the 10 20 day exponential moving average down to 6% again you get down to these levels you get massive bounces historically the NASDAQ Advanced decline issues down to -3000 this is where you get bounces uh NASDAQ mclen oscillator here again down to levels where you get bounces same with the niky mlen oscillator levels where you get big bounces uh and then finally  the ncy advanced decline volume is the lowest level we&#39;ve seen even more than Co it hit - 4,000 that&#39;s mindboggling uh so many of these are stretched or near levels from which you would normally see a bounce back given my thoughts above nothing changes in Outlook for each of these different interviews which we already went through this is an important chart that we covered last week but again I want to reemphasize that the back drop for stock Pickers is the best in 25 years with correlation of stock performance at alltime lows these are periods when xus and emerging markets and UNM magnificent 493 dramatically outperformed these are these are periods where the concentrated stocks at the time like Cisco and Amazon they all took Corrections even though ultimately the thesis were right the valuation and timing was wrong um valuation too high in certain Pockets so you can see here S&amp;P price to book ratio now exceeds March 2000 high again do I want to take that bet and say this time is different the answer is no there&#39;s too much other stuff to do that I don&#39;t have to wake up at night and uh check check the Futures overnight and sleep with my eyes open uh two picks bet on jockeys plus one sector pick we covered VF PayPal xbi covered the uh G Trump relationship covered Etsy and covered uh Boeing Disney why healthc care is not dead the rumors of My Demise have been greatly exaggerated we talked about 62 of the 500 components in the S&amp;P being Healthcare uh we&#39;re down about 20% on average each that&#39;s crazy town with the market all alltime highs that&#39;s where I sniff out opportunity last time you saw that extreme where was 2009 which was a generational opportunity to buy Healthcare and biotech I think you have to be selective but it&#39;s also curious because uh Healthcare is expected to have the second largest earnings growth next year at 21% and you can&#39;t give these stocks away it&#39;s mind-boggling except when you think about oh okay people are worried about RFK just like they were worried about Trump in 2016 and the thing you have to keep in mind is whether they&#39;re Republican or Democrat a lot of them a lot of the uh public servants are bought and paid for by Pharma so we&#39;ll get some stuff done at the margins but it&#39;s not going to be material enough to uh be as bad as the stocks are reflecting is what I&#39;m saying and you could see here uh healthc care got smashed after the election and then after the inauguration up 40% in the next year and same with biotech we love our xbi smashed after the election up 78% in the next year uh same with medical devices Baxter baby smashed after the election up 50% in the next year and um that&#39;s all you need to know with the theme being deals and drugs FDA and FTC being more lenient and Pharma having a big problem with patent Cliffs and a lot of cash why Baxter is not dead which is a a part of the healthcare sector so I just kind of tried to burden everyone with the facts here you can see here a history of cash flow Rising cash flow falling the last time cash flow got this low was 2016 and then the stock recovered materially from 30 to 86 over the next few years and you can just see throughout history revenues are continued to grow return on capital is a little compressed margins are a little compressed these are normal cyclical things um and then you look technically you&#39;re like this is this is so oversold what&#39;s going on technically and you can see every time you got to these extremes whether it&#39;s RSI stochastics Etc it was a basing period here it took a couple of years it&#39;s been going about year and a half here and then it just starts to go and in this case the next move was a 20 bagger in this case the next move was a 15 bagger and we&#39;ll see what happens here I mean we get into things for doubles and triples over a few years but this this one might be good enough to hold for the long term uh you could see you know certainly cash flows down but uh it&#39;s not out and with the turnaround all we look especially you know with the stock down this materially with a turnaround what we look for is solvency risk is off the table which they just did with selling the assets and paying down debt and um and that free cash flow is positive for the most part or it&#39;s only temporarily negative like was in the case of uh Cooper standard but that was just too we had to get involved when we did otherwise we would have missed the Catalyst and um so this one uh you can go through this but you can see on balance share counts effectively the same it&#39;s down from 2010 it&#39;s up from 2021 uh but not materially and then uh debt they&#39;re going to pay down a bunch of this so you can take that down that was a worry for a little while again solvency risk you can see you can read about their moat in the different parts of their business which we highlighted the important parts we&#39;re not going to go through you you know we&#39;ll be here till uh dinner if we do that uh key key points from the earnings call you can see the revenue is up 4% they&#39;re growing these are all things that are fixable this business is impossible to destroy and um I mean they&#39;ve tried but they they failed so so it&#39;s starting to re accelerate and uh they worked overtime to try to destroy it just like at Intel they&#39;re doing and some of the others but Bo they tried it every day day and night to crush it the stock the Stock&#39;s now going up every single day even in a weak Market uh which is exciting to see and what&#39;s more exciting is no one&#39;s talking about it which makes me extra happy uh that&#39;s one of our biggest positions uh so free cash flow is positive it&#39;s down yes but uh if you listen to the conference call you&#39;ll see all the great things but these are the two key things I want to see in a turnaround is improving balance sheet solvency risk off the table through asset sales and free cash flows positive that gives them the runway for operating improvements to take cold and that&#39;s why you get the doubles and triples and you sleep like a baby at night cuz you&#39;re buying businesses with long-term operating history that have shown that they have a durable sustainable moat and that&#39;s why we&#39;re looking at 30 years of data here uh actually not 30 years we&#39;re looking at uh 25 + 15 so almost 40 Years of data and you&#39;ll you&#39;ll they&#39;ll be here for another 40 years so um so that&#39;s the story here on balance margins have been good they&#39;re a little compressed but they&#39;re they&#39;ve got the plan to move forward uh the analyst that I I cited\n\nhere were the key points number one most bullish Catalyst for 2025 could be China growth accelerates we agree uh no one wants Healthcare materials or energy opportunity to be had for sure in materials and Healthcare energy uh on the look we love our com stock we&#39;re going to stick with it um we&#39;re keeping an open mind but but a lot of them haven&#39;t gotten cheap enough for us to get excited uh best performing Equity index of 2025 people are looking to so some small caps and starting to look to China so that&#39;s a positive thing uh a little bit of love in 2020 managers seeing some potential for that uh global economy again improving sentiment but not extreme sentiment so that&#39;s a good thing to see and then uh Global profit expectations again elevated like you see off big trough lows uh but not extreme yet so I think there&#39;s some run Runway there certainly through the inauguration and we should get a garden variety pullback is is our best guess uh and then\n### FEATURED_COMPANY_DEEP_DIVES\nCooper standard update this was exciting to see thanks to my buddy Allen for sending it over uh perfectly on track here nothing more to add uh and the Cox document he sent over I I follow Cox but I didn&#39;t I didn&#39;t get this one and uh or I missed it when I was whatever long story short um what are you seeing interest rates are coming down borrowing costs are coming down uh Mobility costs are coming down what&#39;s going up light vehicle sales the sell through uh is going up December it was 6 16.5 million on an annualized basis uh so let me just see here okay so uh what&#39;s beautiful about this SAR at 16.5 for that one month we got a little pull forward probably from the hurricane so let&#39;s just be you know curbar enthusiasm but uh the beauty that&#39;s happening and this is what I was saying two years ago is if these American automakers don&#39;t start selling $30,000 Cars and $440,000 Cars the Koreans are going to come in and eat their lunch and now it&#39;s a race to the bottom I mean every car you get in if you&#39;re doing an Uber is like a Toyota Rav 4 or uh you know a Kio I don&#39;t even know what they call them or um Toyota Corolla or whatever and so this is where the moneyy is being made and if you look here incentives are going up transaction price is going down affordability improves credit availability expected to expand wage growth expected to continue uh auto loan rates are now down 100 basis points from their Peak new inventory continues to expand and incentives are increasing incentives are the biggest leading indicator of volumes and their uh this is their industry proje ction for 2025 is 16.3 million so if you remember I talked about um 15.8 being their basic Break Even uh and effectively their fixed costs are in place which is why why we always talk about the operating leverage so if you look at if they&#39;re right with a conservative 16.3 let&#39;s say 16.5 doesn&#39;t continue 16 3 that&#39;s 500,000 cars which is effectively all goes to the bottom line okay the material costs are nothing all the fixed costs are in place so you&#39;ve got even if you take the low end let&#39;s say 150 a car uh 500,000 cars divided by 18 million shares you&#39;re talking about $416 of earnings and if they can do $46 of earnings next year and it looks like a growth story and the market starts to price in 7 the next year and you know nine the next year Etc you know I mean even on that scenario and that&#39;s $150 a car what if they&#39;re doing 175 more hybrids and more EVs and uh Etc it could be better but let&#39;s just say on four their trough multiple was 10 times uh their Peak multiple was 20 times I think it&#39;s going to be a great year for Cooper standard next year and um uh that&#39;s where it is so good things come to those who wait and those who wait longer they the Gratitude is the uh the good things are even better so that&#39;s the story of Cooper standard we very excited to see that stuff fear got flushed out down to 34 could go lower before it goes higher we&#39;ll we&#39;ll take a a watch and see um\n### MACRO_DATA_SLIDES\nNational Association of active investment managers uh that was uh that was up to 90 and chain let&#39;s just see where it got to I think it was at a peak so we got to curb their enthusiasm and then we will you know it&#39;s amazing if you take the daytime flight from I take it out of John Wayne which is beautiful it&#39;s 1015 minutes from the house um if you take the daytime flight you don&#39;t get jet lag which is pretty awesome uh let&#39;s see here National Association of active investment managers I was always worried about that I lose two days or whatever no hit the ground running all right so is that a 8250 I guess that printed today let&#39;s move to all right we&#39;re cruising along here some of the data GDP came in stronger 3.1 initial jobless claims came in a little bit better than expected Etc so nothing critical there earnings are still holding up 275 for next year mid- teens earnings growth exploration and production earnings down 7.9% top 30 weights in the last 60 days so again they got to the price has to come down a lot for me to get interested uh and then Industrials uh down 2.2% uh let&#39;s see if I&#39;m not M I&#39;m G to guess that&#39;s probably Boeing let&#39;s just see what if there&#39;s one that&#39;s really oh yeah boing there you go so that&#39;s already priced uh that was priced in at the one 40s and 150s and uh and now it&#39;s back at like 180 and on its way so um yeah wow it got down to 137 I mean felt like we had to buy stock every single day and uh and now it&#39;s moving all right so that&#39;s the story let&#39;s get on to by the way for everyone who um the podcast is over for everyone who likes to stick around for the",
    "TECHNICAL_CHARTS": "\n\nwe're going to cover more in the article of the week you look at pmo buy all it's not quite down to zero so we could have a little bit more pain uh pmo by SPX is closer to areas where you see recoveries obviously active managers got over their skis all in the same stocks those got hit the hardest yesterday uh the put call did Spike up to levels where you usually see a little bit of a back off uh it wouldn't surprise me to see another foe flush just to get out all the weak hands before we bounce back uh but on balance I think we want to uh remain invested through the inauguration and we used the opportunity late yesterday and in after hours to buy some things up at uh at some nice prices and that doesn't mean we got the last tick it just means we took advantage the other thing that I would say is going back to the Trump trade these are the\n### TECHNICAL_CHARTS\ncharts from  2016 from when he got elected uh uh to when he got inaugurated and I just want to remind you on a few of these key obviously Emerging Markets got hit the hardest after he got elected uh all the way through the calendar year before the inauguration and then they shot straight up we're looking at Baba here but it's a proxy for emerging markets down after the election into the calendar year right before the inauguration straight up uh more than a double in less than 12 months uh same with um kweb is the same same type of situation that's Chinese internet which is basically Baba you also saw a little bit of um checkback with the equal weight which is a kind of proxy for the Magnificent 493 and small caps even semiconductors saw a little bumpiness in December before the inauguration and so on so this is stuff that we've seen before solar stocks we continue to like keep our open mind because they did much better under Trump than they did under uh Biden which is counterintuitive biotech was like the wild west after he got elected sold off after the inauguration straight up we're going to cover that uh energy stocks back then went straight up after he got elected and then had a bad year the next year some of them are getting to points that get us interested but for now we exclusively are in com stock which is up a lot uh but it's just getting started um and let's take a look at some of these others just to remind ourselves not to get totally faked out with short-term moves because this type of volatility same with tech you saw some volatility before the inauguration Staples sold off big there's some opportuni starting to show up if you look at like Pepsi and Coke we haven't done anything there but we don't mind buying high quality consumer Brands when they're on sale so we'll keep our eyes peeled utilities if if opportunities come up same thing and Healthcare look at what happened to healthcare after the election remember this was as I discussed with Neil Cavuto this was the period he was going to rip up the Affordable Care Act so right now this is the period where you know RFK is going to ban all vaccines which he's told you he's not going to do he's going to spread out the schedule do things in a more rational sensible way which 99% of people agree with um and uh and the other ones are selling it to you so uh the 1% so uh this will be fine and this is going to be a great opportunity you're seeing it whether it's the fisers of the world the xbis of the world the backers of the world every single thing the you know the insurers centine Etc uh they're all beaten down they're going to they're going to it's like a beach ball underwater um and huge opportunity there and so on so oh let's just quickly remind you because everyone's probably getting sideways about this short-term offsides on us treasuries and the dollar so if you look at he was elected in November early November TLT collapsed from 108 to 95 absolutely Co collapsed and then he got inaugurated it started to Rally into the inauguration bottomed out two months later in March and then started to move straight up over the next couple of years so um so for those of you worried about bond yields compressing it's this is par for the course sell off before after the election buy into the inauguration and it will continue to persist up and yields will will compress similar with the US dollar for those getting faked out today and think that everything's sideways uh same exact thing he got elected the dollar went straight up until the calendar turned uh couldn't go any higher and then completely rolled over the next year and that's why you saw emerging markets do what it did now the P the charts that we're going to cover this week we've got a lot of them uh a lot of them are probably going to be duplicates because I was doing this on the 6-hour plane ride back to California and the internet was so so it was good enough to get the article done which I think was a pretty good and timely article we put that out at like 9:00 last night when Futures were still down uh N9 I don't know if it was pfic I the time kept changing when we were in the air but long story short we got it done uh and that was pretty timely and a pretty unconventional view when we put it out um okay so this is Bank Ling we can skip that this is S&P 500 Advanced decline percent as you can see here it got completely flushed towards levels that you see near bottoms and bounces so that also bodess well we covered a lot of our own in the article of the week\n\nso on so oh let&#39;s just quickly remind you because everyone&#39;s probably getting sideways about this short-term offsides on us treasuries and the dollar so if you look at he was elected in November early November TLT collapsed from 108 to 95 absolutely Co collapsed and then he got inaugurated it started to Rally into the inauguration bottomed out two months later in March and then started to move straight up over the next couple of years so um so for those of you worried about

completely flushed towards levels that you see near bottoms and bounces so that also bodess well we covered a lot of our own in the article of the week here is  the mlen oscillator again these are areas that you get bounces not uh you can go further but um the risk reward starts to get interesting then you have the health care sector this is going to be the most important chart that we cover this week the lowest relative performance of healthc care to the S&P since the 2008 lows uh so that is uh and that was a generational buy opportunity we&#39;ll talk about that this is election year seasonal composite so what did we see here we got some uh move higher early December some hard chop in the middle of December and then after the 21st straight up Santa comes to town it wouldn&#39;t shock me if that it if that turns out to be correct uh so let&#39;s see if this if this holds this is since 1928 this normal mid December uh chop is pretty pretty darn normal until the 21st so we&#39;re at the 19th so maybe tomorrow&#39;s week again and Monday uh mix and then maybe we get a little turnaround Tuesday action reason this chart keeps repeating is I think there was an accidentally a header uh put into the mix when um when I was putting this all together so we&#39;ll just ignore it uh Bull and Bear indicator is not at an extreme so we you know keep it in mind this is from heartnet uh the contrarian view The Price is Right uh oh he&#39;s talking about eight shares out perform the S&P in 2024 you China Trade Surplus just hit a record high at 957 billion China share of global car production up 1% to almost 40% the past 20 years uh okay so his point\n\n### TECHNICAL_CHARTS\nhere is  the mlen oscillator again these are areas that you get bounces not uh you can go further but um the risk reward starts to get interesting then you have the health care sector this is going to be the most important chart that we cover this week the lowest relative

years\n### HEADLINES_AND_NEWS\nhere is  Trump wants growth not inflation and if consensus too fearful of q1 tariffs China stock set to outperform more entry point for international inq1 so har Net's making a big call it's time to buy China stocks uh China Financial conditions are the easiest since June of 20 that was right after the covid lows we know the big rally we got into 2022 and when when was the last time that China conditions and people don't realize how how easy conditions are in China because it feels like there's a new headline every day they cut this ratio they cut this interest rate they do this half stimulus and they do all this stuff but it's adding up ladies and gentlemen and it's adding up to the point where you get massive rallies let's just take a look at the last three times that Financial conditions were this easy in China what happened so uh May 2020 and all I really care about is Baba so let's just do that um okay so you had May 2020 uh that shot up the from 190 to 312 in less than a year and then prior to that the last time Financial conditions were that easy was November 2016 that's right here ladies and gentlemen which by the way this is the analog that we've been using here let me just show you for the new listeners um this is really interesting how a lot of these things are linking together doesn't mean they'll work perfectly but it does mean that history does tend to rhyme take a look here okay so November 2016 is right here that is the last time you had Financial conditions this easy we covered May 20th so that was like a huge move 100 points in in less than a year but going back here it's interesting you're seeing the conditions exactly the same thing you have this break and then this lower low and November 16 is when Trump got elected so like right now you had Bob is starting to get uh recovered then Trump got elected you were down for a few months down for a few months and then at the turn of the thing so straight up from 855 to 200 and change in just about a exactly a year 85 to 20 84 to 207 uh and it's very interesting because Bob is recovering off these lows just like it was Trump gets elected 3 months down we're in the third month down and then straight up for 12 months so doesn't have to repeat but conditions are very similar and now that you can see it empirically that Financial conditions uh this is uh average of percentile ranks of China 10year government bond yield R&B and oil price since 2010 and when you get to that and then let's go back to 200 10 you can't see Alibaba wasn't there but let's just see uh hang sang going back to that so you can just see that this is a regular occurrence 2010 so you you had some strength there as well so here's 2016 straight up and now here we are in December of 2024 and uh maybe the other one wasn't the most important chart this is probably the most important chart that we're going to cover until we get to the next most important chart China T China Trade Surplus at record high 957 billion uh then we've got China equities the biggest inflow in nine weeks that was from last week so you got that and then S&P is skewed by expensive Mega caps the average stock trades near a record discount to the index greater than one standard deviation below average average that is a big deal ladies and gentlemen and when's the last time we saw that our favorite year 20012 2002 which set the stage for emerging markets and international to outperform along with small caps uh gap between cheap and expensive stocks is wide I mean this extreme is becoming severe and um if AI is going to be as great as everyone is expecting it's just going to take longer like it always does just like Amazon is as great as everyone was expeced from 95 to to 2000 except it dropped 90% before over the next 15 years it became as great as everyone expected and the same thing's going to happen with a lot of these AI stocks and everything else uh value trades at a discount PE so again you got to go back to 20012 2002 this is just setting up perfectly same on Price to Book same on price to sales it's all there ladies and gentlemen and if you don't take advantage of aberrational periods like this and load the boat uh and by the way you should do whatever you're going to do I'm just telling you how I think go to hedge fund tips.com click on terms this is opinion not advice uh as always but um this is how big money made here's what we saw we got to December everyone's smiling so wide we could even been out of sideways and then guess what uh you have this uh equal weight gets smashed for the first half of the month and just like it did in the end of October and just like it did at the beginning of September and just like it did at the beginning of August and then it always bounces back so all our stocks are coming back they'll be back and um and that's the story so but this is just a normal weird rotation that just keeps happening it happened this last time Trump got elected as well uh moving on this is the 10-day Advance decline line you can see it's oversold here due for a bounce this is the net NASDAQ uh ncy mlen oscillator again these are areas that you get bounces from uh and we got there last night uh\n\naverage that is a big deal ladies and gentlemen and when&#39;s the last time we saw that our favorite year 20012 2002 which set

Trump got elected as well \n### TECHNICAL_CHARTS\nmoving on this is the 10-day Advance decline line you can see it&#39;s oversold here due for a bounce this is the net NASDAQ uh ncy mlen oscillator again these are areas that you get bounces from uh and we got there last night  here is\n\nthe small cap uh filled this Gap maybe we&#39;ll get start to get a bounce off that in the next few days um vix got up to 27 so these are these are flush outs and we&#39;ll talk about it in the article I think probably a fun blew up certainly a lot of momo people on Leverage got smoked the margin clerks had a field day yesterday here&#39;s the max 7 with a 6.1% plunge yesterday that&#39;s huge um that&#39;s from Mike Sardi same with this is rate of change again this is what you see towards buyable lows uh Advanced decline percent same thing here these extremes you start to get a bounce uh these are the charts that we&#39;ve just covered with the pmo by all pmo by SPS ta Dow Jones down 10 days in a row longest losing streak since 1974 half of that as I said with Neil was UNH Boeing was up Disney was up Etc here&#39;s ISM Manufacturing versus S&P 500 EPS annual change you can see here with earnings going up the ISM Manufacturing will follow and that is very good for the overall economy and it sets the stage for an economy like we saw in Trump 1.0 where uh uh everyone participates the lowest end of economic people start to do better than ever in terms of real wages and we&#39;re going to start to see that moving forward as well us retail sales was driven by motor vehicles and Motor Parts drove the bus this was the big thing that led to the retail sales beat incentives are going up volumes are going up inventories are going up this is all perfect for Cooper standard this also helps Advance Auto Parts as the average uh car on the road is now 13 years retail sales strengthen on jump in motor vehicle purchases we love the sound of that Atlanta GDP now is still tracking at 3.1% for Q4 so if you&#39;re perplexed as to why Powell uh curbed Your Enthusiasm and said we&#39;re going for two cuts next year instead of four even though we&#39;ve been saying that for two three months on this podcast um uh the economy is holding up and he&#39;ll be dated dependent you can see how quickly he pivots uh whether they should have taken two cuts off of the SCP dotplot or one cut off uh coin flip but since he had one to Center he probably thought it was good to go hawkish China pushes back against Bond frenzy send yields climbing we said these are the things that we would see as the rally starts to recover it&#39;s the same thing we saw in early 2017 before the inauguration yields will start to go up the R&amp;B is going to start to go up China economy-wide Pro prices in longest decline since 1999 again these were times 2009 2016 2001 these were times to be buyers of Chinese equities not sellers China&#39;s two-speed economy industry is soaring consumer is lagging uh that is uh that will catch up and that those things are in the pipeline NASDAQ getting close to the top of this top end range I don&#39;t put much Credence in these type of lines drawn on charts but it&#39;s always good to pay attention to Mega cap growth and Tech positioning is you know uh one PL one standard deviation above the median going back uh they don&#39;t say how far going oh going back to to so 15 years uh and these are when you see these type of extremes like late 2001 that&#39;s when Tech starts to sell off I&#39;m not saying we&#39;re there yet I&#39;m just saying be mindful if you&#39;re in indices that have forced you to be overweight these names uh they they keep going until they don&#39;t and when they don&#39;t uh it&#39;s they don&#39;t give you a warning signal to uh let you know it&#39;s time to get out they they they get you out harder and faster than you could ever imagine economic surprises could be turning in favor of global xus that&#39;s exactly what I talked about with Neil Cavuto the economic surprises us minus G10 at an extreme US dollar at an extreme and these things will be turning in 2025 in our view uh this chart I thought was pretty interesting four main types of AI you can start to learn about that this is going to be a 152 year Trend uh you will have a ShakeOut before all these things come to be realized uh but all the dreamers right now that are buying things up you know 40 50 times sales they are going to to be right about the theme they&#39;re going to be wrong about where they bought it and um just like we were buying Google an Amazon Handover fist in Fall of 2022 when everyone was puking it out and March of 2023 and made double pluses on those easy um we will be buying a lot of these stocks when they&#39;re down 80 70 80% that have good businesses that are temporarily impaired and we will rinse and repeat that&#39;s what we do will we be buying them when they&#39;re at 40 50 60 time sales and going to 80 90 100 times sales hell no because that&#39;s just gambling on can I get off the train fast enough and when you&#39;re managing decent size the answer is it&#39;s hard to get off the train fast enough uh yen is at its cheapest in 50 years again you know you go back to these points in time this is an extreme that will reverse and we will take advantage of it um on to the next China made deliver the biggest rate Cuts in a decade in 2025 that&#39;s from Bloomberg uh we covered the CH China fisal Financial conditions easiest since June 20 uh June of uh 2000 again print this chart out put it on your wall and when you get nervous about the day-to-day movement in price just go back and look at what happened to Chinese stocks every single time Financial conditions got these easiest these easy see what happened uh 3 months later and a year later and 2 years later and you will be smiling so wide you could eat a banana sideways um number of protests is is up this is further pressure for them to take action uh market cap of The Magnificent 7 as a share of the total index I mean this is crazy town ladies and gentlemen you can see it and you can um decide if you want to continue to play on the skinny branches uh wave of stronger productivity growth starting this is great for manufacturing the global economy for people at the lower levels of income are going to start to benefit from this this is what keeps the economy humming along uh pretty exciting to see that tariffs we&#39;ve covered a million times at 100 200e plus lows everyone&#39;s saying we&#39;re going to start a trade war and we&#39;re going to go into a depression except we started in 1918 at 5% went to 18% before Holly Smoot and um and that&#39;s that so beware of the people who are speaking emotionally and unburdened by the facts they will lead you astray 10year yield so it&#39;s up against this trend line again probably poke through just to mess with everyone this will roll back over this is the this is Trump 1.0 is the same as Trump 2.0 it&#39;s just crazy town until the calendar flips and the inauguration so deal with it on the bonds deal with it on the uh dollar we bought some TLT yesterday and we&#39;ll leave it at that equal weight so here we go the midcaps came down to this trend line or whatever they call it uh small caps came down so you know whether you&#39;re buying it down at the red line or you&#39;re buying it here it really doesn&#39;t make any difference in the scheme of things uh industrial so you can just see some of these sell-offs semiconductors uh here&#39;s Pharma this is part of the healthcare theme we&#39;re going to be talking about along with biotech which we own\n\nBoeing uh commits $1 billion to speed up Dreamliner production the 737 is back we talked about

uh here&#39;s from a hedge fund manager in Asia China may be posed for poised for a decade long bull run uh I agree with him halfway I think it&#39;s going to be 5 years and done and then article of the week healthc care left for dead\n### TECHNICAL_CHARTS\nstock market and sentiment results  so here&#39;s that Health Care chart that shows the relative performance of healthcare to the SNP at the lowest level since the uh great financial crisis lows and here&#39;s what I wrote late last night which was uh well first move wrong move question mark and I saidwell just when I thought I was done with the article of the week chair Powell hosted the FED presser and made things interesting I&#39;ve been doing this for a while and have come out several times after fed meetings saying quote the first move is often the wrong move I think it may apply once again but could take a few days to play out this afternoon felt I wrote this uh just after the close this afternoon felt either a like a fund blew up or margin clerks were taking a bunch of dumb overleveraged money out to the Woodshed to put them out of their misery tell me how you really feel Tom we used the opportunity to top up positions across the board end of day and after hours this is not to say we got the last tick as I&#39;m sure we will see some retail selling in the morning as well but in selective spots we bought the margin of safety is so large that the downside is limited I live for days like this I got to tell you I do live for days like that I don&#39;t I do not think this is a December 2018 when Powell said um Powell said that um we&#39;re going to put it on autopilot and he tanked the market 20% right before Christmas uh as we&#39;ve been saying on the podcast not to expect more than one to2 Cuts in 2025 today the FED confirmed it with their Dot Plot and S summary of economic projections if you&#39;re wondering what drove the markets crazy it was this little green circle so uh they took the September projection uh the September projection was the FED funds rate would be down to 3.4 which would be accommodative uh it&#39;s estimated that the neutral rate is 3.5 now they took it up to 39 so they effectively to took two cuts off the table for 2025 neutral rates are estimated at 3.5 level which fed is neither restrictive nor accommodative this implies that the FED will remain somewhat restrictive in 2025 but does not guarantee it it was not surprising to us but apparently it was to those who are levered long in momo stocks and shiny objects so when the fundamentals are irrelevant due to structural Force selling I looked to some technicals to see when the bleeding might begin to coagulate I found a number of indications that we could be nearing that point and others that were mixed leading me to think it could be a couple Day event uh but not a couple week event hence accepting imperfection and beginning to take Vantage of opportunity where it makes amazing sense in the intermediate and long term here&#39;s some of what I&#39;m paying attention to at the moment so here&#39;s the nicey 10% volume index again these are levels where you usually get bounces uh DOW swanland trading oscillator volume again this is pretty extreme uh pring Emerging Market diffusion indicator again where you tend to get uh bounces or near bottoms uh then you got the material stocks o the 10 20-day moving average uh it&#39;s down to zero so if you don&#39;t have any material stocks this is the time to be having material stocks we have albaro um and kind of you could kind of count com stock in that bucket but not really uh same thing with healthc care stocks above the 10 20 day exponential moving average down to 6% again you get down to these levels you get massive bounces historically the NASDAQ Advanced decline issues down to -3000 this is where you get bounces uh NASDAQ mclen oscillator here again down to levels where you get bounces same with the niky mlen oscillator levels where you get big bounces uh and then\n\nthe table for 2025 neutral rates are estimated at 3.5 level which fed is neither restrictive nor accommodative this implies that the FED will remain somewhat restrictive in 2025 but does not guarantee it it was not surprising to us but apparently it was to those who are levered long in momo stocks and shiny objects so when the fundamentals

niky mlen oscillator levels where you get big bounces uh and then finally  the ncy advanced decline volume is the lowest level we&#39;ve seen even more than Co it hit - 4,000 that&#39;s mindboggling uh so many of these are stretched or near levels from which you would normally see a bounce back given my thoughts above nothing changes in Outlook for each of these different interviews which we already went through this is an important chart that we covered last week but again I want to reemphasize that the back drop for stock Pickers is the best in 25 years with correlation of stock performance at alltime lows these are periods when xus and emerging markets and UNM magnificent 493 dramatically outperformed these are these are periods where the concentrated stocks at the time like Cisco and Amazon they all took Corrections even though ultimately the thesis were right the valuation and timing was wrong um valuation too high in certain Pockets so you can see here S&amp;P price to book ratio now exceeds March 2000 high again do I want to take that bet and say this time is different the answer is no there&#39;s too much other stuff to do that I don&#39;t have to wake up at night and uh check check the Futures overnight and sleep with my eyes open uh two picks bet on jockeys plus one sector pick we covered VF PayPal xbi covered the uh G Trump relationship covered Etsy and covered uh Boeing Disney why healthc care is not dead the rumors of My Demise have been greatly exaggerated we talked about 62 of the 500 components in the S&amp;P being Healthcare uh we&#39;re down about 20% on average each that&#39;s crazy town with the market all alltime highs that&#39;s where I sniff out opportunity last time you saw that extreme where was 2009 which was a generational opportunity to buy Healthcare and biotech I think you have to be selective but it&#39;s also curious because uh Healthcare is expected to have the second largest earnings growth next year at 21% and you can&#39;t give these stocks away it&#39;s mind-boggling except when you think about oh okay people are worried about RFK just like they were worried about Trump in 2016 and the thing you have to keep in mind is whether they&#39;re Republican or Democrat a lot of them a lot of the uh public servants are bought and paid for by Pharma so we&#39;ll get some stuff done at the margins but it&#39;s not going to be material enough to uh be as bad as the stocks are reflecting is what I&#39;m saying and you could see here uh healthc care got smashed after the election and then after the inauguration up 40% in the next year and same with biotech we love our xbi smashed after the election up 78% in the next year uh same with medical devices Baxter baby smashed after the election up 50% in the next year and um that&#39;s all you need to know with the theme being deals and drugs FDA and FTC being more lenient and Pharma having a big problem with patent Cliffs and a lot of cash why Baxter is not dead which is a a part of the healthcare sector so I just kind of tried to burden everyone with the facts here you can see here a history of cash flow Rising cash flow falling the last time cash flow got this low was 2016 and then the stock recovered materially from 30 to 86 over the next few years and you can just see throughout history revenues are continued to grow return on capital is a little compressed margins are a little compressed these are normal cyclical things um and then you look technically you&#39;re like this is this is so oversold what&#39;s going on technically and you can see every time you got to these extremes whether it&#39;s RSI stochastics Etc it was a basing period here it took a couple of years it&#39;s been going about year and a half here and then it just starts to go and in this case the next move was a 20 bagger in this case the next move was a 15 bagger and we&#39;ll see what happens here I mean we get into things for doubles and triples over a few years but this this one might be good enough to hold for the long term uh you could see you know certainly cash flows down but uh it&#39;s not out and with the turnaround all we look especially you know with the stock down this materially with a turnaround what we look for is solvency risk is off the table which they just did with selling the assets and paying down debt and um and that free cash flow is positive for the most part or it&#39;s only temporarily negative like was in the case of uh Cooper standard but that was just too we had to get involved when we did otherwise we would have missed the Catalyst and um so this one uh you can go through this but you can see on balance share counts effectively the same it&#39;s down from 2010 it&#39;s up from 2021 uh but not materially and then uh debt they&#39;re going to pay down a bunch of this so you can take that down that was a worry for a little while again solvency risk you can see you can read about their moat in the different parts of their business which we highlighted the important parts we&#39;re not going to go through you you know we&#39;ll be here till uh dinner if we do that uh key key points from the earnings call you can see the revenue is up 4% they&#39;re growing these are all things that are fixable this business is impossible to destroy and um I mean they&#39;ve tried but they they failed so so it&#39;s starting to re accelerate and uh they worked overtime to try to destroy it just like at Intel they&#39;re doing and some of the others but Bo they tried it every day day and night to crush it the stock the Stock&#39;s now going up every single day even in a weak Market uh which is exciting to see and what&#39;s more exciting is no one&#39;s talking about it which makes me extra happy uh that&#39;s one of our biggest positions uh so free cash flow is positive it&#39;s down yes but uh if you listen to the conference call you&#39;ll see all the great things but these are the two key things I want to see in a turnaround is improving balance sheet solvency risk off the table through asset sales and free cash flows positive that gives them the runway for operating improvements to take cold and that&#39;s why you get the doubles and triples and you sleep like a baby at night cuz you&#39;re buying businesses with long-term operating history that have shown that they have a durable sustainable moat and that&#39;s why we&#39;re looking at 30 years of data here uh actually not 30 years we&#39;re looking at uh 25 + 15 so almost 40 Years of data and you&#39;ll you&#39;ll they&#39;ll be here for another 40 years so um so that&#39;s the story here on balance margins have been good they&#39;re a little compressed but they&#39;re they&#39;ve got the plan to move forward uh the analyst that I I cited",
    "MACRO_DATA_SLIDES": "\n\nthe small cap uh filled this Gap maybe we&#39;ll get start to get a bounce off that in the next few days um vix got up to 27 so these are these are flush outs and we&#39;ll talk about it in the article I think probably a fun blew up certainly a lot of momo people on Leverage got smoked the margin clerks had a field day yesterday here&#39;s the max 7 with a 6.1% plunge yesterday that&#39;s huge um that&#39;s from Mike Sardi same with this is rate of change again this is what you see towards buyable lows uh Advanced decline percent same thing here these extremes you start to get a bounce uh these are the charts that we&#39;ve just covered with the pmo by all pmo by SPS ta Dow Jones down 10 days in a row longest losing streak since 1974 half of that as I said with Neil was UNH Boeing was up Disney was up Etc here&#39;s ISM Manufacturing versus S&P 500 EPS annual change you can see here with earnings going up the ISM Manufacturing will follow and that is very good for the overall economy and it sets the stage for an economy like we saw in Trump 1.0 where uh uh everyone participates the lowest end of economic people start to do better than ever in terms of real wages and we&#39;re going to start to see that moving forward as well us retail sales was driven by motor vehicles and Motor Parts drove the bus this was the big thing that led to the retail sales beat incentives are going up volumes are going up inventories are going up this is all perfect for Cooper standard this also helps Advance Auto Parts as the average uh car on the road is now 13 years retail sales strengthen on jump in motor vehicle purchases we love the sound of that Atlanta GDP now is still tracking at 3.1% for Q4 so if you&#39;re perplexed as to why Powell uh curbed Your Enthusiasm and said we&#39;re going for two cuts next year instead of four even though we&#39;ve been saying that for two three months on this podcast um uh the economy is holding up and he&#39;ll be dated dependent you can see how quickly he pivots uh whether they should have taken two cuts off of the SCP dotplot or one cut off uh coin flip but since he had one to Center he probably thought it was good to go hawkish China pushes back against Bond frenzy send yields climbing we said these are the things that we would see as the rally starts to recover it&#39;s the same thing we saw in early 2017 before the inauguration yields will start to go up the R&amp;B is going to start to go up China economy-wide Pro prices in longest decline since 1999 again these were times 2009 2016 2001 these were times to be buyers of Chinese equities not sellers China&#39;s two-speed economy industry is soaring consumer is lagging uh that is uh that will catch up and that those things are in the pipeline NASDAQ getting close to the top of this top end range I don&#39;t put much Credence in these type of lines drawn on charts but it&#39;s always good to pay attention to Mega cap growth and Tech positioning is you know uh one PL one standard deviation above the median going back uh they don&#39;t say how far going oh going back to to so 15 years uh and these are when you see these type of extremes like late 2001 that&#39;s when Tech starts to sell off I&#39;m not saying we&#39;re there yet I&#39;m just saying be mindful if you&#39;re in indices that have forced you to be overweight these names uh they they keep going until they don&#39;t and when they don&#39;t uh it&#39;s they don&#39;t give you a warning signal to uh let you know it&#39;s time to get out they they they get you out harder and faster than you could ever imagine economic surprises could be turning in favor of global xus that&#39;s exactly what I talked about with Neil Cavuto the economic surprises us minus G10 at an extreme US dollar at an extreme and these things will be turning in 2025 in our view uh this chart I thought was pretty interesting four main types of AI you can start to learn about that this is going to be a 152 year Trend uh you will have a ShakeOut before all these things come to be realized uh but all the dreamers right now that are buying things up you know 40 50 times sales they are going to to be right about the theme they&#39;re going to be wrong about where they bought it and um just like we were buying Google an Amazon Handover fist in Fall of 2022 when everyone was puking it out and March of 2023 and made double pluses on those easy um we will be buying a lot of these stocks when they&#39;re down 80 70 80% that have good businesses that are temporarily impaired and we will rinse and repeat that&#39;s what we do will we be buying them when they&#39;re at 40 50 60 time sales and going to 80 90 100 times sales hell no because that&#39;s just gambling on can I get off the train fast enough and when you&#39;re managing decent size the answer is it&#39;s hard to get off the train fast enough uh yen is at its cheapest in 50 years again you know you go back to these points in time this is an extreme that will reverse and we will take advantage of it um on to the next China made deliver the biggest rate Cuts in a decade in 2025 that&#39;s from Bloomberg uh we covered the CH China fisal Financial conditions easiest since June 20 uh June of uh 2000 again print this chart out put it on your wall and when you get nervous about the day-to-day movement in price just go back and look at what happened to Chinese stocks every single time Financial conditions got these easiest these easy see what happened uh 3 months later and a year later and 2 years later and you will be smiling so wide you could eat a banana sideways um number of protests is is up this is further pressure for them to take action uh market cap of The Magnificent 7 as a share of the total index I mean this is crazy town ladies and gentlemen you can see it and you can um decide if you want to continue to play on the skinny branches uh wave of stronger productivity growth starting this is great for manufacturing the global economy for people at the lower levels of income are going to start to benefit from this this is what keeps the economy humming along uh pretty exciting to see that tariffs we&#39;ve covered a million times at 100 200e plus lows everyone&#39;s saying we&#39;re going to start a trade war and we&#39;re going to go into a depression except we started in 1918 at 5% went to 18% before Holly Smoot and um and that&#39;s that so beware of the people who are speaking emotionally and unburdened by the facts they will lead you astray 10year yield so it&#39;s up against this trend line again probably poke through just to mess with everyone this will roll back over this is the this is Trump 1.0 is the same as Trump 2.0 it&#39;s just crazy town until the calendar flips and the inauguration so deal with it on the bonds deal with it on the uh dollar we bought some TLT yesterday and we&#39;ll leave it at that equal weight so here we go the midcaps came down to this trend line or whatever they call it uh small caps came down so you know whether you&#39;re buying it down at the red line or you&#39;re buying it here it really doesn&#39;t make any difference in the scheme of things uh industrial so you can just see some of these sell-offs semiconductors uh here&#39;s Pharma this is part of the healthcare theme we&#39;re going to be talking about along with biotech which we own\n\n### MACRO_DATA_SLIDES\nhigh yield spreads at a record low uh this was the changes in the FED speak so you saw this descent from Beth hammock who was a non-voting member uh and then they added this words in considering the extent and timing of additional adjustments so we know the results you can see the NASDAQ and S&P here just want to make sure I didn&#39;t miss anything after that so you see the pullback here these are kind of normal pullbacks we saw it in September um saw it in July we saw it in March and we also saw that this gets extended stops above the 20-day moving average here&#39;s semiconductors so when you visualize this here&#39;s a vix to C to vix 3mon ratio hasn&#39;t got this High since early August we know that was an Abrupt correction on the uh Bank of Japan hike and then they walked it back and uh it worked here&#39;s Global stimulus fiscal plus monetary impulse uh percentage points of GDP by GDP weighted contribution and there&#39;s just showing that there&#39;s a lot of stimulus moving into the market now and so on so back to this\n### HEADLINES_AND_NEWS\nthis is a great article that one of my clients and Friends sent how Elon Musk and Taylor Swift can resolve us China relations this is by Thomas fredman and he&#39;s just amazed he went over there and saw all the amazing things that they&#39;re doing for manufacturing uh and read this article in the New York Times and uh you will be as impressed as I was uh here&#39;s from a hedge fund manager in Asia China may be posed for poised for a decade long bull run uh I agree with him halfway I think it&#39;s going to be 5 years and done and then article of the week healthc care left for dead\n### TECHNICAL_CHARTS\nstock market and sentiment results  so here&#39;s that Health Care chart that shows the relative performance of healthcare to the SNP at the lowest level since the uh great financial crisis lows and here&#39;s what I wrote late last night which was uh well first move wrong move question mark and I saidwell just when I thought I was done with the article of the week chair Powell hosted the FED presser and made things interesting I&#39;ve been doing this for a while and have come out several times after fed meetings saying quote the first move is often the wrong move I think it may apply once again but could take a few days to play out this afternoon felt I wrote this uh just after the close this afternoon felt either a like a fund blew up or margin clerks were taking a bunch of dumb overleveraged money out to the Woodshed to put them out of their misery tell me how you really feel Tom we used the opportunity to top up positions across the board end of day and after hours this is not to say we got the last tick as I&#39;m sure we will see some retail selling in the morning as well but in selective spots we bought the margin of safety is so large that the downside is limited I live for days like this I got to tell you I do live for days like that I don&#39;t I do not think this is a December 2018 when Powell said um Powell said that um we&#39;re going to put it on autopilot and he tanked the market 20% right before Christmas uh as we&#39;ve been saying on the podcast not to expect more than one to2 Cuts in 2025 today the FED confirmed it with their Dot Plot and S summary of economic projections if you&#39;re wondering what drove the markets crazy it was this little green circle so uh they took the September projection uh the September projection was the FED funds rate would be down to 3.4 which would be accommodative uh it&#39;s estimated that the neutral rate is 3.5 now they took it up to 39 so they effectively to took two cuts off the table for 2025 neutral rates are estimated at 3.5 level which fed is neither restrictive nor accommodative this implies that the FED will remain somewhat restrictive in 2025 but does not guarantee it it was not surprising to us but apparently it was to those who are levered long in momo stocks and shiny objects so when the fundamentals are irrelevant due to structural Force selling I looked to some technicals to see when the bleeding might begin to coagulate I found a number of indications that we could be nearing that point and others that were mixed leading me to think it could be a couple Day event uh but not a couple week event hence accepting imperfection and beginning to take Vantage of opportunity where it makes amazing sense in the intermediate and long term here&#39;s some of what I&#39;m paying attention to at the moment so here&#39;s the nicey 10% volume index again these are levels where you usually get bounces uh DOW swanland trading oscillator volume again this is pretty extreme uh pring Emerging Market diffusion indicator again where you tend to get uh bounces or near bottoms uh then you got the material stocks o the 10 20-day moving average uh it&#39;s down to zero so if you don&#39;t have any material stocks this is the time to be having material stocks we have albaro um and kind of you could kind of count com stock in that bucket but not really uh same thing with healthc care stocks above the 10 20 day exponential moving average down to 6% again you get down to these levels you get massive bounces historically the NASDAQ Advanced decline issues down to -3000 this is where you get bounces uh NASDAQ mclen oscillator here again down to levels where you get bounces same with the niky mlen oscillator levels where you get big bounces uh and then\n\nhere were the key points number one most bullish Catalyst for 2025 could be China growth accelerates we agree uh no one wants Healthcare materials or energy opportunity to be had for sure in materials and Healthcare energy uh on the look we love our com stock we&#39;re going to stick with it um we&#39;re keeping an open mind but but a lot of them haven&#39;t gotten cheap enough for us to get excited uh best performing Equity index of 2025 people are looking to so some small caps and starting to look to China so that&#39;s a positive thing uh a little bit of love in 2020 managers seeing some potential for that uh global economy again improving sentiment but not extreme sentiment so that&#39;s a good thing to see and then uh Global profit expectations again elevated like you see off big trough lows uh but not extreme yet so I think there&#39;s some run Runway there certainly through the inauguration and we should get a garden variety pullback is is our best guess uh and then\n### FEATURED_COMPANY_DEEP_DIVES\nCooper standard update this was exciting to see thanks to my buddy Allen for sending it over uh perfectly on track here nothing more to add uh and the Cox document he sent over I I follow Cox but I didn&#39;t I didn&#39;t get this one and uh or I missed it when I was whatever long story short um what are you seeing interest rates are coming down borrowing costs are coming down uh Mobility costs are coming down what&#39;s going up light vehicle sales the sell through uh is going up December it was 6 16.5 million on an annualized basis uh so let me just see here okay so uh what&#39;s beautiful about this SAR at 16.5 for that one month we got a little pull forward probably from the hurricane so let&#39;s just be you know curbar enthusiasm but uh the beauty that&#39;s happening and this is what I was saying two years ago is if these American automakers don&#39;t start selling $30,000 Cars and $440,000 Cars the Koreans are going to come in and eat their lunch and now it&#39;s a race to the bottom I mean every car you get in if you&#39;re doing an Uber is like a Toyota Rav 4 or uh you know a Kio I don&#39;t even know what they call them or um Toyota Corolla or whatever and so this is where the moneyy is being made and if you look here incentives are going up transaction price is going down affordability improves credit availability expected to expand wage growth expected to continue uh auto loan rates are now down 100 basis points from their Peak new inventory continues to expand and incentives are increasing incentives are the biggest leading indicator of volumes and their uh this is their industry proje ction for 2025 is 16.3 million so if you remember I talked about um 15.8 being their basic Break Even uh and effectively their fixed costs are in place which is why why we always talk about the operating leverage so if you look at if they&#39;re right with a conservative 16.3 let&#39;s say 16.5 doesn&#39;t continue 16 3 that&#39;s 500,000 cars which is effectively all goes to the bottom line okay the material costs are nothing all the fixed costs are in place so you&#39;ve got even if you take the low end let&#39;s say 150 a car uh 500,000 cars divided by 18 million shares you&#39;re talking about $416 of earnings and if they can do $46 of earnings next year and it looks like a growth story and the market starts to price in 7 the next year and you know nine the next year Etc you know I mean even on that scenario and that&#39;s $150 a car what if they&#39;re doing 175 more hybrids and more EVs and uh Etc it could be better but let&#39;s just say on four their trough multiple was 10 times uh their Peak multiple was 20 times I think it&#39;s going to be a great year for Cooper standard next year and um uh that&#39;s where it is so good things come to those who wait and those who wait longer they the Gratitude is the uh the good things are even better so that&#39;s the story of Cooper standard we very excited to see that stuff fear got flushed out down to 34 could go lower before it goes higher we&#39;ll we&#39;ll take a a watch and see um\n### MACRO_DATA_SLIDES\nNational Association of active investment managers uh that was uh that was up to 90 and chain let&#39;s just see where it got to I think it was at a peak so we got to curb their enthusiasm and then we will you know it&#39;s amazing if you take the daytime flight from I take it out of John Wayne which is beautiful it&#39;s 1015 minutes from the house um if you take the daytime flight you don&#39;t get jet lag which is pretty awesome uh let&#39;s see here National Association of active investment managers I was always worried about that I lose two days or whatever no hit the ground running all right so is that a 8250 I guess that printed today let&#39;s move to all right we&#39;re cruising along here some of the data GDP came in stronger 3.1 initial jobless claims came in a little bit better than expected Etc so nothing critical there earnings are still holding up 275 for next year mid- teens earnings growth exploration and production earnings down 7.9% top 30 weights in the last 60 days so again they got to the price has to come down a lot for me to get interested uh and then Industrials uh down 2.2% uh let&#39;s see if I&#39;m not M I&#39;m G to guess that&#39;s probably Boeing let&#39;s just see what if there&#39;s one that&#39;s really oh yeah boing there you go so that&#39;s already priced uh that was priced in at the one 40s and 150s and uh and now it&#39;s back at like 180 and on its way so um yeah wow it got down to 137 I mean felt like we had to buy stock every single day and uh and now it&#39;s moving all right so that&#39;s the story let&#39;s get on to by the way for everyone who um the podcast is over for everyone who likes to stick around for the",
    "ASK_ME_ANYTHING_QA": "\n\nask me anything  we've ever had uh pretty amazing to see some of the quality coming through here uh here's from Vincent sentore asking about Yeti uh We've covered Yeti a million times on this show and we continue to think that the financials look great and we continue to do nothing because we just can't really get our arms around the durable moat and the non-consumable nature of it but I get it it's uh jeez every time I look at it I say the same thing why don't I own this and I continue to avoid it I look I think you're okay here I just uh like I can't understand the moat but I can't understand the moat for a $20,000 handbag either so I think this is the you know Birkin bag for pickup truck driving Real Americans and uh maybe that needs to be paid close attention to um I look I I can't tell you not to own this uh Vincent uh I don't own it I don't own it yet that could change I continue to think about owning it and I continue to not own it so that tells you everything you know I you after years in the business I just trust my Spidey Sense and I'm perfectly super duper comfortable with missing out love missing out errors of omission are great errors of O commission I will be very unaccepting of especially when I commit them ### ASK_ME_ANYTHING_QA\nall right so let's take a look at Papa John's we've covered this one many times as well the reason I honestly i' I've never loved I think you're going to be okay with this one but ever since they stole the business from the founder and basically like canceled them for Stuff uh I just I don't I don't like that you know the guy built the business and you know bunch of strangers come in and tell them that they think they know better so for me I don't know just feels like a bunch of bureaucrats running the business I guess they're doing an okay job but uh I I'd have to understand this better but i' never really got over that fact and you know maybe that's my bad obviously many businesses do extremely well after the founders move on but um this one's got kind of flattish revenues balance sheet looks balance sheet looks a little lever to me I'm going to pass on this one next is Lucas cleaz don't know that Chris Savage mentioned biotech we'll have a good year take a look at bntx solid pipeline very cheap looks ready to break out uh I I tend to not buy individual biotech names we own a basket of uh xbi um this is like modna uh pass I have no Edge on their pipeline I'm a generalist Paul Pesco okay there's no question here he's is telling me to that OLED is bottoming and po has good fundamentals so okay if you say so uh Joseph cook Merry Christmas thanks for all you do thoughts on Yeti we just covered that again I have no objection to it I'm just not going to own it uh okay here's one Don L hi Tom you you always know that you're G to get a shitty AMA when someone puts a single letter for their last name so all right Don L uh how can you be confident in China's

to get a shitty AMA when someone puts a single letter for their last name so all right Don L uh how can you be confident in China&#39;s recovery when none of their stimulus Works seems to be a fundamental issue with their system uh I can be confident by looking past one day of headlines  and looking out through history when Financial conditions were this easy what happened in the next 12 and 24 months and the answer is a lot of good happened after Financial conditions were this easy so you can continue to what read Bloomberg and that one writer at Barons who seems to no longer work there uh uh if you want the negative story but if you want the positive story um you know just stick to the facts have they fumbled the ball for two plus years you bet uh but uh like all politicians they make the they make the right decision after exhausting all other possibilities and it seems like they&#39;re at that point they&#39;ve done a lot of stimulus they announced more last week and uh and we&#39;ll take it from there moving on to thank you for your informative videos each week this is Richard L can you take a look at Evolution AB Swedish ticker Evo online casino operator funnels at games uh so all the profits are in Asia all right let&#39;s see Evo okay Sweden let&#39;s see here wow that&#39;s some cash flow baby revenues are growing cash flow is growing it&#39;s cheap so yeah all you got to do is figure out why is there a bearish story and what is it because I see nothing wrong with the financials um let take a look at the balance sheet yeah I mean what the margins like on this business all right what&#39;s the cash flow look there&#39;s nothing not to love here um all I could tell you is you have to understand their moat you have to understand their regulatory risk and if it&#39;s trading down just because of Asia I&#39;d be a buyer not a seller uh but just under who are their competitors balance sheets great let&#39;s see if they&#39;ve screwed anyone with uh dilution hell&#39;s the income statement where the hell is the income statement oh here it is all right little bit of dilution nothing crazy given that growth rate so uh Richard L I think you got something here but now the work begins you got to understand their competitive Advantage do they have a moat can someone come in and completely clip them what is the bearish thesis why why isn&#39;t it uh fully valued and um what&#39;s the be case and if you can get comfortable around all those things I think you found yourself a good one on to the next Euro stock from Chris Davis an undervalued copper play I don&#39;t do uh commodity stocks in general other than um some gas and oil no no thank you negative cash flow commodity stock no interest Portillos is getting Cheaper by the day we have engaged Capital same activist in vfc invested there thoughts about Paras uh I like it my kids like it haven&#39;t done anything with it it wasn&#39;t the numbers weren&#39;t great but I think it&#39;s probably worth a punt in a personal account this is not something I could sleep with for clients but I do think it&#39;s turning around and I do think it&#39;s a good product and uh I kind of like it so uh and we&#39;ve covered that a bunch of times it got cheaper so maybe now&#39;s the time to take a punt but like would this be a high conviction I love it I&#39;ve seen so many small Burger chains come and go Burger F uh Habit Burger blah blah blah they&#39;re all public promotes and they just dwindle out and die I think Portillos might be different but Sha desiah covered Pizza already uh J Su Smith by the way for for Papa John&#39;s I think it&#39;ll be fine guys I just I&#39;m just not in love with it jasm Smith uh hi Tom I want to let you know I&#39;m one CPS double away from being your client thanks for your opinion not advice my question is on qxo isn&#39;t there going to be one more delution event when they make the deal shouldn&#39;t that create one more opportunity not necessarily um I I yeah I I mean look it&#39;s just a brad Jacobs premium I want to be involved with this uh when we got in if everything goes perfect in 10 years it&#39;s an 8 to a 10 bagger and if it doesn&#39;t then I probably get out at a double and call it a day but with him things tend to work out Tim D is also asking about Papa John so Everyone likes pap Papa John&#39;s I I don&#39;t think there&#39;s anything wrong with it Hudson Technologies hdsn now this is interesting what do they do let&#39;s see HTS looks like revenues fell off a bit let&#39;s see what they do provision solutions for recurring problems within the refrigeration industry sale of refrigerant and industrial gas yeah this is materials like Dow and all these stocks that are smashed this looks like it should probably be a private company versus a public company I I tend to not play in these type of things what&#39;s the market cap 230 million so look the number one thing you got to figure out\n\nbut I do think it&#39;s turning around and I do think it&#39;s a good product and uh I kind of like it so uh and we&#39;ve covered that a bunch of times it got cheaper so maybe now&#39;s the time to take a punt but like would this be a high conviction I love it I&#39;ve seen so many small Burger chains come and go Burger F uh Habit Burger blah blah blah they&#39;re all public promotes and they just dwindle out and die I think Portillos might be different but Sha desiah covered Pizza already uh J Su Smith by the way for for Papa John&#39;s I think it&#39;ll be fine guys I just I&#39;m just not in love with it jasm Smith uh hi Tom I want to let you know I&#39;m one CPS double away from being your client thanks for your opinion not advice my question is on qxo isn&#39;t there going to be one more delution

also asking about Papa John so Everyone likes pap Papa John&#39;s I I don&#39;t think there&#39;s anything wrong with it Hudson Technologies hdsn now this is interesting what do they do let&#39;s see HTS looks like revenues fell off a bit let&#39;s see what they do provision solutions for recurring problems within the refrigeration industry sale of refrigerant and industrial gas yeah this is materials like Dow and all these stocks that are smashed this looks like it should probably be a private company versus a public company I I tend to not play in these type of things what&#39;s the market cap 230 million so look the number one thing you got to figure out here is  why they&#39;ve destroyed sharehold capital for 30 years and why now is different and if you can answer that question then it&#39;s worth doing some real work on and pursuing but when I see a business like this where it&#39;s just been constant Destruction for 30 40 50 years I&#39;m not interested so uh my my best guess\n\n### ASK_ME_ANYTHING_QA\nhere is why they've destroyed sharehold capital for 30 years and why now is different and if you can answer that question then it's worth doing some real work on and pursuing but when I see a business like this where it's just been constant Destruction for 30 40 50 years I'm not interested so uh my my best guess this is set up to benefit the O the the uh Founders not the owners and that's why the stock never does anything for 30 years so uh tell me why I'm wrong and tell me what they've changed or who they've changed and I'm listening but you know revenues are declining meaningfully the last 3 years and uh even though cash flow is still healthy it's kind of a passero um Jonathan mcky Healthcare earnings expected to grow and I've gone into Baxter wondering your thoughts on Mna we've covered Mna not for me I don't I can't understand their pipeline backer is a little simpler it's devices easier for me to understand can you take a look at valet I think we've looked at it again mining companies they have a tendency to just screw it up no matter how good the conditions are um my guess is what you're buying it for the dividend what's the dividend I'm sure it's got a big dividend and that's why you're interested because the Stock's done nothing for years I mean it's the stock is been the same for again 20 years like tell me why it's going to be different the next 20 years it's a Mining stock all they do is screw things up so all right so you got a 16% dividend yield so that's why you're interested let's just take a quick look to get any sense if that is sustainable usually it's not so they cashes down from 14 billion down to four and what are they doing here taking down their share count that's good free cash flows coming down but what is there all right the common Dividends are 5 billion a year and their free cash flow is 4.5 and their balance sheet is showing five billion cash my guess is that unless they hit a mining cycle that dividend is going to get cut um You probably don't get hurt with the stock it probably bounces back to 15 but it's not not not what I do I think it's okay though um and"

longer work there uh uh if you want the negative story but if you want the positive story um you know just stick to the facts have they fumbled the ball for two plus years you bet uh but uh like all politicians they make the they make the right decision after exhausting all other possibilities and it seems like they&#39;re at that point they&#39;ve done a lot of stimulus they announced more last week and uh and we&#39;ll take it from there moving on to thank you for your informative videos each week this is Richard L can you take a look at Evolution AB Swedish ticker Evo online casino operator funnels at games uh so all the profits are in Asia all right let&#39;s see Evo okay Sweden let&#39;s see here wow that&#39;s some cash flow baby revenues are growing cash flow is growing it&#39;s cheap so yeah all you got to do is figure out why is there a bearish story and what is it because I see nothing wrong with the financials um let take a look at the balance sheet yeah I mean what the margins like on this business all right what&#39;s the cash flow look there&#39;s nothing not to love here um all I could tell you is you have to understand their moat you have to understand their regulatory risk and if it&#39;s trading down just because of Asia I&#39;d be a buyer not a seller uh but just under who are their competitors balance sheets great let&#39;s see if they&#39;ve screwed anyone with uh dilution hell&#39;s the income statement where the hell is the income statement oh here it is all right little bit of dilution nothing crazy given that growth rate so uh Richard L I think you got something here but now the work begins you got to understand their competitive Advantage do they have a moat can someone come in and completely clip them what is the bearish thesis why why isn&#39;t it uh fully valued and um what&#39;s the be case and if you can get comfortable around all those things I think you found yourself a good one on to the next Euro stock from Chris
