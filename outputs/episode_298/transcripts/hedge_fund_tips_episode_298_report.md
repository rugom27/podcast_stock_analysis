He is also very positive on the consumer and discretionary stocks, especially those that have been left for dead. He sees a rotation out of mega cap stocks and into smaller buys. He also likes turnarounds and dividend aristocrats. He is particularly bullish on Canada Goose and believes it is a generational opportunity. He also added Etsy as a new position.

**Tom's Current Market Conviction: Bullish → 9/10** 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥☆

- Trump's budget bill will spur massive growth.
- Sentiment is still near COVID low levels and great financial crisis low levels.

- Earnings expectations are low, setting the stage for beats.
- CEO and seuite confidence is coming back, animal spirits coming back, deals coming back, investment coming back.

## Macro Thesis & Key Data Points
The market has shifted from focus on tariffs and bombs to tax cuts, growth, and deregulation. The only way to fight the situation of high debt to GDP is to spur massive growth. Deregulation in the second half, changing capital requirements for banks, allowing them to lend more, allowing them to hold treasuries, uh allowing the stable coins with the Genius Act, creating massive demand for US treasuries, you're going to see rates come down.

| Indicator | Value | Tom's Interpretation |
|-----------|-------|----------------------|
| Debt to GDP | 120% | The last thing you can do is cut your way to prosperity, the only thing you can do is grow your way out of the problem like we did in the 1950s. |
| 10-year yield | 4% foreign change | There's no uneasiness in the bond market at present. |
| Global M2 money supply | Record high | You got liquidity in the market. |
| Earnings growth Q2 | 5% | Sets the stage for earnings to beat expectations. |
| Dollar | Weakening | Expect continued weakening dollar, expect continued great performance from of international equities relative to the US |
