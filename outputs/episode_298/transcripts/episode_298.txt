Welcome to Hedge Fund Tips with Tom Hayes. I'm Tom Hayes and this is your 298th videocast podcast for the week ending July 3rd, 2025. Happy Independence Day for all of you celebrating tomorrow. Uh much better than happy liberation day. And uh and let's move ahead. Uh family first as always, then we'll get down to business. That's me with Annabelle by the beach and Lucky looking confused as usual. Uh, moving along. That's Annabelle at her birthday party at Great Wolf Lodge blowing out the candles. More candles. She got four cakes there. There's with her friends. That was an awesome day. Ah, for those of you who've been following along for the last three years, I've been playing golf for three and a half almost four years now. Uh, goal was to get to high singledigit uh handicap. I'm now down at low index 11.3. Uh, so I got 1.3 strokes to go to hit that goal, which means today I'll probably shoot 100 because the golf gods don't take kindly on celebrations. This was out in Connecticut. Uh, this is my buddy Blake Jason and the pro Drew uh on one of the amazing new greens on the back nine. Pretty incredible time. Uh th this back nine that was redone by Brian Schneider who did Old Banyan and Tamarack and Garden City and all these great clubs. Um f first time out I shot a 47 then 44. Third time I shot a 40. So it is doable. This just gives you an idea here. I mean look at this putt. Unbelievable. Um, and then, um, an uh, Mimi is in Croatia for water polo camp, which is super exciting. She's having a blast. Uh, and they're doing some sightseeing and all the other fun stuff. She swam through that tunnel, kind of led the crew through there. She is fearless. Uh, then I had the pleasure to join David Lynn and his wild and engaged audience. Uh you could always see their incredible comments on YouTube under the clip. So we're going to listen in here. Is your review that the Russell will continue outperforming uh throughout the second half of the year because the 493, the unmagnificent 493 will start doing better. Is that your view? I think it'll not only outperform for the second half of the year, I think it'll outperform for the second half of the decade. So Powell is not the right guy for the job right now because he doesn't understand history. You're not going to cut your way to prosperity. and uh uh cutting your way at this point will create a slowdown in the economy which is going to take more stimulus. So the there's only one way out and it's it's going to be massive growth and running nominal GDP hotter than we have in decades. We're speaking now with Thomas Hayes, managing member of Great Hill Capital. We'll be going over his market outlook. Uh Thomas has been on my show several times. He's been one of the more accurate guests in his predictions. So let's see what he has in store for us today. Welcome back to the show, Thomas. Good to see you. Uh great to see you as well. Thanks for having me back, David. Tom, let's start by taking a look at what's happening today. Uh, let's take a look at the budget bill that's being voted on right now as we speak on the 2nd of July. Trump's budget bill is close to becoming law. This is from the BBC. Trump's massive tax and spending budget bill is returned to the US House of Representatives as the clock ticks down at the president's 4th of July deadline for lawmakers to present him with a final version that can be signed into law. So, it looks like it's happening. Uh, the bill nearly clear their clear the Senate or upper chamber of Congress on Tuesday. uh VP JD Vance cast a tiebreaking vote for more than after more than 24 hours of debate and resistance from some Republican senators. Um let's take a look at what this tax bill, this big beautiful bill, uh means for not just Americans but also investors. Now uh Trump has vowed to cut spending. I don't know if he's just going 180 on that or if this is a part of a bigger plan. I'll let you evaluate it. Yeah, look, it it's a negotiation and politicians number one job is to get reelected. Uh, and the way they get reelected, the Congress people and the senators, is to bring home the bacon. So, uh, he can't get what he wants with help out helping other people get what they want. I think at this point with debt to GDP 120%, you're not going to cut your way to prosperity and uh, cutting your way at this point will create a slowdown in the economy, which is going to take more stimulus. So the there's only one way out and it's it's going to be massive growth and running nominal GDP hotter than we have in decades. And this bill is a foundation of doing so. This coupled with deregulation if you look and it's the way we did it in the in the ' 50s. So we we had 128% debt to GDP following World War II. We borrowed a ton of money to fight a visible enemy here in the sense of COVID. We borrowed a bunch of money to fight an invisible enemy. And then we kept borrowing more and more even after the uh enemy was vanquished. But we are where we are. And the only play way to way to fix it and bring debt to GDP levels down, cut them in half like we did in the ' 50s is running growth above trend. And by the way, we ran inflation above trend in the 50s. So Powell is not the right guy for the job right now because he doesn't understand history. uh inflation is going to have to run around 3% for us to have nominal growth four 5% and get debt to GDP down to 60%. Uh this bill sets that stage with or without Powell. Uh you've got the mortgageund uh $1 million mortgage interest deduction, which is a good thing for housing. You got the $5,000 credit. I'll tell you, I think what's interesting, no tax on tips. He promised that in his campaign. That's fine. But the $10,000 interest deduction on auto loans for new cars built in America, I think is a big deal because you haven't seen the auto volumes recover to precoid levels like you do every cycle for the last 50 years. Uh and this is going to accelerate that. The the reason that's important that creates a lot of high-paying manufacturing jobs in the US and and all the ancillary benefits the average car on the road is 13.5 years. So not only are the uh OEMs like Ford, GM, etc. going to going to start to flourish from something like this, but all the auto parts suppliers which have been kind of left for dead uh because the volumes have been anemic are going to start to accelerate. That's a lot of middle America jobs. And if Trump 2.0 is anything like Trump 1.0, you know, the real beneficiaries of his policies are everyday working people. Real wages rose dramatically in his first term. Uh, and I think we're going to see more of that uh in the second term. Then you take the baby investment accounts at $1,000 a pop. If you have a baby between 2024 and 2028,000 bucks goes into a IRA type of uh instrument so that uh new babies can participate in the American dream. They wake up at 20 years old, 30 years old, 35 years old. They've got a down payment sitting waiting for them uh for housing and family formation. They've got uh capital to maybe start a business uh further their education, etc. That that is a great thing. Uh the headlines are all about no one's going to be able to use hospitals and uh no one's going to get any food stamps. It's it's not quite that black and white, but it is a trade-off. They are making some cuts to places permanently cut the tax cuts and jobs act uh uh tax benefits. It's it's huge. We'll continue to spur growth. So, there's a lot of great stuff here. State and local. They they were able to negotiate that up to 40,000. So, the people on the coasts are happy. Um but Hasset uh the net effect Hasset claims and believes it's going to add $10,000 of uh income per household over time. and you have that type of money, American consumer, you can never bet against them. When they have money, they spend it. This is um an article detailing some of the key items of the bill. Let's take a look at some of these a look at the key items in Trump's big beautiful bill. Social Security taxes, uh vow to eliminate taxes on social security income, more Medicaid requirements, uh changes to Medicaid, uh food benefits reforms have been added to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, which is used by over 40 million lowincome Americans. No tax on overtime or tips. You've mentioned that. Clean energy tax cuts. One of the most notable divisions between House and Senate Republicans is the Senate's proposal for clean energy tax breaks. So, what happens next? Uh, which of these items or perhaps others stood out most to you? Well, look, there's nothing good in that article, right? I mean the the only thing that uh you know Musk has gone apoplelectic about this is because all a lot of the the green tax credits are getting cut uh and it's subsidized uh the business for for many many years and he's uh done amazing things because of it. Uh but you know 15 years is a long runway to continue to subsidize at some point if there's validity in in the business. It's got to stand on its own legs and I think it will. Uh and I think it's going to hurt his competitors more than it's going to hurt him and he's going to be the leader in EVs. So um so so that's part of the give and take uh as far as the cuts go as far as the the puts and takes. I've covered the benefits, you've covered the costs. Uh but net net it it fosters growth. How stimulative is this bill? In other words, is this the fiscal impulse that we need uh for uh for basically a return to uh nominal highs in GDP growth? Uh yes. Uh I I actually co-hosted a show uh and interviewed this economist who put out a report that addressed this specific issue. He says in its current form and he was kind of you know generally bearish. He said it will add 40 basis points to GDP as it currently stands. I think it's underestimating the multiplier effect of these things actually uh winding up in the economy. You know for one thing if you look at the the mistakes that Powell has made holding back the housing recovery. That's 16.2% of GDP is housing. You know 72 million millennials can't get their family started. the average housing uh starter home purchase is is now pushed back into the late30s. That's awfully late to have kids and start a family and it's because of this uh unnecessary 200 basis points of restriction by Powell. So if he doesn't cut in July, the the the solution is very simple. Uh Trump is going to announce some dovish person as his successor and the market's going to immediately discount 200 basis points of cuts. Powell will be sitting a lame duck. he's welcome to sit in his chair for another year, but he will have zero power, zero influence, and zero effect. Um, alternatively, he can take the right action and move to the data dependence business, which is the mandate of the Fed, uh, uh, versus the prediction dependent business, which now he thinks he's a forecaster. But if he looks as at his own forecast in the summary of economic projections, he acknowledges that it's a temporary bump. And and if that's the case, he should have already been cutting. He also acknowledges uh or if he believes his own predictions, he should look at the his prediction for real GDP at 1.4%. If he actually believes his own predictions, he should have cut 50 basis points in June. Well, uh the Powell um press conference, well the FOMC press conference rather last uh last time was quite dramatic to me at least listening to uh the FOM FOMC press conference uh because Powell directly stated that uh he sees inflationary pressures coming and I think that was you know as clear and direct as you can get from the Fed chairman. I I don't know if you agree with that. Well, listen, he he he he also believed that quantitative easing should be on autopilot in December of 2018 and crashed the market 20% in 3 weeks before Christmas until Minutian called all the banks on a Sunday night and bailed them out. He also believed that inflation was transitory when we know it wasn't and and uh was behind the curve. So, it's too late. Powell, look, the guy's a great business person. I hear he's a great golfer. He plays over at Congressional. He probably would have been a great Treasury Secretary, but he has no feel. He's in the wrong position and he's being rigid because he read a book about Arthur Burns in the 70s. The conditions, economic conditions, the demographic conditions are nothing like they were in the 70s. And rather than holding tight to quote unquote preserve his legacy, he's got an opportunity to go out like Seinfeld, cut rates, stop screwing 72 million millennials, stop screwing 300 million taxpayers who are spending $600 billion on interest that they don't need to on interest. That's just the the the interest on US debt, not to mention their interest pays payments in their everyday life, whether it's auto loans, uh uh student loans, uh trying to uh refinance a house, to buy a house, etc. Uh all of that is a huge governor and restriction on the economy that doesn't need to happen. We if we're going to grow our way out and get get things in balance, debt to GDP, inflation's got to be higher, not lower. It's got to be three three and a half. And we got to inflate some of the debt away. And we've got to have growth above that level uh in order for the formula to work. Otherwise, you cut and you slow things down and you have this 200 basis points of restriction, 200 basis points Fed funds rate above the rate of inflation. Uh and all that's going to happen is you're going to increase debt to GDP because you can't get growth levels at the levels you need them to bring that ratio down like we have in the past. and and he just is unwilling to see it or he's uh uh you know has other reasons for for being belligerent, but it's it's hurting 300 million people e even if it's only intended to hurt one person. It's hurting more than 300 million people in a in a meaningful way. Well, it does beg the question as to what the Fed is looking at in terms of data because headline CPI came in a little bit lower than the previous month on on an annualized basis, but they are that the Fed is projecting uh higher inflation or they're, you know, afraid of uh inflation not being uh reflected in the CPI as of yet. So, I wonder if they're looking at other uh coins and indicators that are more timely or real-time data that may point to a rise in inflation or just, you know, consumer feedback, something. It's a great question because uh it it you you you tend to get different outcomes when you actually burden yourself with the facts. Like, why aren't they talking to Andrew Jasse who was on CNBC yesterday saying, "We're just not seeing it." I mean, if if anyone's going to see it ahead of time, it's going to be Amazon and the fact that he's out there and they're ignoring the real data on the ground. And and by the way, I mean, let's say they're right, okay? I'm willing to be wrong. I'm humble enough to say maybe they're right. Maybe it's going to go up. What if they cut 100 basis points and they're wrong? What's so complicated about raising 25 basis points a couple times? It's much easier to quell inflation than it is to get yourself out of deflation. Deflation takes billions of dollars of stimulus packages, massive unemployment, huge amounts of pain in the economy, years of wasted uh underproductivity. Uh whereas if you if you run a little too hot, you can you can curb that pretty darn quickly. Uh and and there's no reason for them to not have that flexible thinking versus I'm going to be right. inflation is going to go up. I predict it with my crystal ball. Well, all of his predictions have been wrong so far. So maybe this time he flips the coin and he's right, but the mandate is for them to be data dependent. And right now they're explicitly being prediction dependent. For what reason? I I have no idea. I can only speculate, but it's uh it's hurting a lot more people than the one person it's intended to. All right. So the we've talked about so far fiscal and monetary policy. So the fiscal side being the big beautiful bill and the monetary side being the um Fed action or lack of action shall we say. Uh so what does this mean for an investor? Uh how do these two um fiscal and uh monetary forces play into bond yields first and foremost and ultimately um uh stocks and and and fixed income? Well, the the the beauty of bond yields right now is the the the one thing that matters more than anything is the 10-year yield because that's what mortgages mortgage rates are tied to. And Bessant is going to solve for that. Uh and probably a shadow Fed appointment at after the July meeting if they haven't take action is going to solve for that. But what Besson's going to do and is already done, you saw in the last week or so, uh they put out the changes for the SLR, the bank capital requirements, holding having to hold less capital against treasuries, which will create more demand for uh US treasuries at the banks, which will spur more lending. uh the Treasury then then can uh issue at the short end of the curve and then buy in the longer end of the curve like they did in 2012 an operation type twist to hold down the 10-year yield. Uh and I think on that basis and they've they've anticipated 30 to 70 basis points reduction in the 10-year yield once that's implemented that should be implemented sometime late this summer. uh that would bring the 10-year yield down to 350, 370, which is going to bring 30-year mortgage rates down below six. I think when you see that, you're going to see unlimited demand for housing. And that's a theme that we've positioned ourselves for, not with the home builders because there'll be a race to bottom in margins, but with the arms dealers, the building suppliers, uh the QXOs of the world, which has been a big winner for us. That's Brad Jacobs, uh Beacon Roofing. he bought now he's doing a couple more tuckins. Uh the Stanley Black & Deckers of the world, the Generax of the world, etc. are ancillary ways to play that recovery. Uh timelinewise, when do you think this will happen? Next 3 months. Well, how you in terms of the socks or in terms of of the implementation of the uh amendments to the SLR and bank capital requirements? The implement the implementation of the amendments. Yeah, within the next two to three months. Okay. Okay. Do you think markets are going to preempt that or react to it afterward? Well, I think there's an element of that because if you consider the perception of the big beautiful bill is um financial irresponsibility that that's the way it's being packaged right now. That's the way it's being sold uh in the media. And yet 10-year yield has has been relatively contained around 425. I think there's a there's an offset uh what would just be a discreet reaction to the big beautiful bill is being offset by expectations of what Bessant and and Bowman and uh etc are going to be implementing on the bank capital requirement side. And I think that once the bill is passed and we get closer to implementation and it becomes real and people can understand what the increased demand of treasuries both from this and from the Genius Act with stable coins uh is going to be on on US treasuries, I think we're going to be surprised that everyone who is calling for 5% when the 10-year yield was at 480 is going to be shocked that it's uh moving to three and a half. And and that's usually what happens when everyone gets crowded to one side of the boat. All right, let's take a look at some of the commentary you've posted recently. This is uh hedge fund tips, which I encourage everyone to check out. Time for a makeover stock market and sentiment results. This was posted uh last week, I think. And um underneath are various video clips of you talking about your market outlooks and your picks. uh give us a summary of how sentiment is um behaving now with uh with uh with surveys uh with and other data that you're looking at and whether or not um sentiment um is an indicator of of any buying or selling action that investors should be taking a look at. Yeah, I think that's great. Thank you uh for for doing that. Uh so the first thing I would say is that as we know David, sentiment got completely washed out on April 7th. Okay. on the basis of tariff fears um and you saw a trillion dollars of sales from CTAs etc at the exact wrong time. Bank of America put out their fund manager survey of 222 managers with a half a trillion under management about a week and a half ago. I was shocked. While sentiment has started to recover, as of a week and a half ago, it's still similar or in the range of levels not seen since the COVID lows and the great financial crisis lows. I mean, you can't make this up. And the market was like 1 and a half% off of all-time highs a week and a half ago. And managers are still underweight, uh, non-believing, pessimistic. Most of them had been waiting for a retest of the lows. And now they are being forced buyers. Okay, so the shorts have had to cover. They were the first buyers. Now the institutional managers that sold in the hole are being forced in on every positive headline, whether it's a deal today with Vietnam or, you know, Japanese not taking our rice, now taking our rice. I mean, you can't make this stuff up. Or the Canadians dropping the digital uh services tax and coming back to the table. Every new headline is going to force more money into the market, and there's still a lot on on the sidelines. Then you take global M2 money supply is now at a record. It had been basically flatlining since 2022. So you got liquidity in the market. People off sides on positioning have to chase up to keep their jobs to catch the indices. When you're behind behind the mark on performance and the indices are ahead of you. What do you do? You buy the catch-up trade. You buy the lagards which is why the I think the second half is going to be dominated by the 493 versus the seven mag seven rather. Uh and then expectations are still pretty low. You know, you're going into earnings season. They cut expectations from 9.4% earnings growth on March uh 31st for Q2. It's now down to 5%. So that sets the stage for earnings to beat expectations. We'll see what guidance looks like. But but you're seeing seuite CEO CFO uh confidence coming back, animal spirits coming back, deals coming back, investment coming back. So, my expectation is guidance is going to be a little bit better, barring some, you know, crazy town stuff between now and the 9th, which we'll get a taste of, I'm sure. Uh, but I think we're going to get more deals announced than we're going to get crazy town. And, uh, and with that said, it forces more money in. This is that time of year. I think I start to get a little nervous if we push a, you know, meaningfully higher in July. uh probably start to take a few chips on the table heading into uh into the fall just just for normal volatility and and for those things that have reached full intrinsic value at that time. Let's drill a little bit deeper into your thesis of why the 493 could outperform the Mag 7, the unmagnificent 493 versus the Magnificent 7. Is this a valuation story? Is this a uh an operating margin story? Is this just sentiment shifting? What is it? uh it's a combination of all but the number number one thing that uh determines uh the valuation of business is in the short term it's in it's a the market is a voting machine based on emotion in the long intermediate and long term it's a weighing machine based on fundamentals and if you look at the simple fundamentals of the mag 7 uh earnings growth in the first quarter of this last year was over 30% first quarter of this year was 27% that's going to decelerate down to 10.2% 2% in the first quarter of 2026. At the same time, the 493 collectively had negative earnings growth towards the end end of last year and first quarter of this year. That is now going to accelerate to 10.3% earnings growth by Q1 of 2026. So, effectively with the MAG 7, you've got collapsing earnings growth because of all the capex uh that they're putting in. And most people say it's offensive spending. I would say it's defensive spending because we don't know the return on investment as of now. Uh it'll probably be substantial, but but it's to be determined. Uh and uh and the unmagnificent 493 is accelerating earnings growth. The problem with the MAG 7 is the multiples have not come down relative to the earnings growth deceleration, and that's a divergence that will play catch-up. uh whereas the unmagnificent 493 you can get more earnings growth if you look a couple quarters out for uh basically half the multiple uh and and I think all these managers that c got caught behind the eightball in early April are going to have to play the lagger trade. So what does that mean in terms of the indices? The indicy returns could be more subdued in the second half than people are expecting in that in the current state of euphoria right now. uh they'll be good. But if you consider that you know 30 40% of the weight of that index has meaningfully declining earnings growth rates uh the fortunes are going to be made or the big money is going to be made in the other 493 which will have less of an impact on the index appreciation and more of an impact on your portfolio appreciation. I mean, I could see some active managers up 50 75% in the next 9 to 12 months with uh the indices up maybe, you know, another 9 to 11%. You know, something in that range. Uh and people wonder why uh you know some stocks feel like they're grinding sideways and doing not much which is because their earnings growth is decelerating and others are doubling and tripling because they're playing catch-up uh postco and and finally getting back to normalized free cash flow levels. So Tom, let's talk about the consumer. I'm curious to see how you think the consumer is going to spend uh his or her money later on in the year and whether or not these spending patterns may impact certain industries more than others. I'll give you a few stats uh first to jump off of. So um as of the latest PCE data we have here after a decrease in spending overall by $29 billion in May. Uh good spending fell $49 billion. Services spending rose $19.9 billion. Real PCE inflation adjusted declined by 0.3%. That's PCE spending. Uh other key uh retail uh consumer data, credit card spending per household rose by 0.8%. year-over-year in May. Uh delinquency rates and charge offs have been eased slightly. Um 2025 June retail sales data showed uh continued resilience in spending. Uh weak consumer sentiment, however, uh still lingers in a 0.3% month-over-month decline in real percent real PC, which is what I just mentioned. So, um bit of a mixed bag here. Spending less overall, but credit card spending is up. Uh delinquencies have been written off slightly. So I think people are spending more on their credit cards but spending less overall. So what does this mean for you? Well, let's let's parse that because what you said was goods spending decelerated. And the reason that goods spending decelerated is because there was a monstrous pull forward prior to tariffs in March. Okay, both with autos, both with retail goods, both with everything under the sun. So goods got a huge pull forward and we saw it in the numbers prior to uh what did he call that uh independence day or what what was it was it was it called independation day liberation day. Liberation day. Independence Day is coming up. Uh liberation day prior to liberation day. So so that's what happened. But now you're seeing services spending up. So they got all the goods that they're going to need ahead of the tariffs. So now they've got this money that where are they spending it? They're spending it in services. Services are actually going up. Second thing you need to keep in mind is that in April uh sentiment got completely flushed with with the tariffs. So not only did they buy all their stuff up front, but then they were scared because their 401ks were down for a few weeks. So naturally spending went down. What you have seen in May and June is a rebound uh both in umish and in uh CB confidence uh a rebound in sentiment now that there seems to be some rationality around tariff policy uh and uh and that has been reflected in the rebound in services spending but the goods they got to work through all the toilet paper that they bought in March uh that everyone was afraid was going to be a crazy town. So, I think that there's some of these that are a little short-term misleading because of the lagged effect of anticipation of Liberation Day and then the lagged effect of the uh unfear and uncertainty created during the month of March and and certainly April uh and now the slow recovery of both. But I did find that stat interesting that the credit card defaults have decelerated. Um, which uh which was also a little bit uh a little bit surprising and I I think that's a function of what we're starting to see the taste of now that we're through the chaos of the first few months. Uh is real wages rising at the lower end. So, I I think that's going to be a positive trend and a theme for the next three and a half years is uh less um you know, Wall Street will do fine, but in in the first term of Trump, it wasn't a Wall Street term. It was a Main Street term. Main Street did on a relative Wall Street did fine. Main Street did much better on a relative basis in terms of percentage gains from where they were at baseline than Wall Street did. And I think the same is going to be true uh for the next three and a half years. I think regular Americans are going to do exceptionally well starting with this big beautiful bill and some of the deregulation policies that are to come, the capital requirements, opening up the lending, the credit spots. I mean the game is literally just getting started. If mainstream is going to do mainstream is going to do better in the uh in the foreseeable future, does that mean a shift towards discretionary plays uh should be the um uh should be the focus for investors? Yeah, I absolutely think that's right. Um and I do think a lot of the discretionary stocks have have kind of been left for dead. uh you see some of these turnarounds starting to get a little bit of uh uh a glimmer of hope whether it's Nike, whether it's VF Corp. Uh some of that's China related that China is starting to recover as well. Uh more and more stimulus, more and more consumption focused. Uh but but I do like that theme. I think housing is going to be a major factor. I think when people can trade out, there are a lot of boomers trapped with millions of equity that don't want to trade down because they don't want to trade a 3% mortgage for seven, but they will trade a three for five and a half if they can pull $2 million of equity out of their house and put that in investing. So, uh I think I think you're going to see more of that. I do really like that theme going forward of of betting on the consumer and particularly in those areas uh that have been beat down quite a bit particularly home building and home home building some of the consumer discretionary you know Nike is not one we own we we would own but we're we're going to play the turnaround with Brack and Daryl over at VF Corp which is a similar type theme we don't want to get too much exposure there uh Estee Lauder is another one that that had been left for dead. This is the number one in premium skin care and premium uh cosmetics around the world and they got smashed because of China primarily. But the good news is even though their revenues went down um uh they've maintained share in all their regions. Even in China they maintain 99% of their share. So, as the consumer comes back, which they will, uh they'll be coming, they'll be getting more a larger and larger piece of the pie as their smaller competitors were hurt more during this trough. Uh and and they start to recover. I mean, this is a business that has been buying and selling brands. They've got, you know, a dozen plus brands, whether it's Clinique, whether it's MAC, whether it's Dr. Chart, the Korean skincare that's popular with the young kids like my daughters. uh they've got something for everyone. Aveda at the spas uh and they will buy and sell the right brands respectively. It's a family controlled business. It's going to be a great recovery as the consumer comes back not only in China but globally and we're seeing more and more of that dayby day. This is an interesting uh take on uh investing because I'm just trying to pull up an article here to show you uh for this next question. Uh yeah, here we go. Uh luxury good spending is falling in the US actually all around the world. I'm seeing reports of similar stories here. Uh the the wealthy are just cutting back on travel, uh business class tickets, uh luxury goods spending, uh car sales. Um even even in the high-end car market and watch market, you're seeing prices fall for high-end items. Um I don't know if that's a signal of anything, whether that that's a is that a lagging indicator or a leading indicator. It's 100% lagging. I'm looking at your article as we speak. It said uh 6.8% 8% decline in April, 8.5% decline in March. Well, those were the people that were hit the most because they they they live off of assets and and their assets were down 20 25% for a few weeks. Of course, uh they pulled back and they'll be the first ones to recover as consumer sentiment comes back. And you know, if you go to any decent restaurant, good luck getting a reservation. I mean, I'm in Orange County here and like uh on a Tuesday night, I had trouble getting a reservation at a decent restaurant to to go out with a few friends. So, uh, so it is what it is. I mean, they're just as quickly as they fell on the uncertainty for 2 weeks and, uh, as long as they didn't puke in the hole like all the CTAs and institutional investors, uh, they they're doing just fine and they've recovered more than what they lost. Let's finish off in your overall market sentiment or outlook rather. So, this is the S&P versus the Russell. Again, outperformance by the big caps versus the Russell 2000 on a year-to- date basis, one-year basis, 6 month and 3 months, any time frame that you want to put it. Um, except the last month when the Russell started outperforming. Um, is your view that the Russell will continue outperforming uh throughout the second half of the year because the 493, the unmnificent 493 will start doing better. Is that your view? I think it'll not only outperform for the second half of the year, I think it'll outperform for the second half of the decade. So uh I think this is going to be very similar to 2001 to 2006 when uh small caps dramatically outperformed value outperformed i.e. the unmagnificent 493 I guess is the way you'd kind of view that mostly today. uh international outperformed. I think you're going to see a continued weaker dollar and on a relative basis like you saw in the first half of this year international and you know I was on your show last year when you couldn't give away an international stock pounding the table on international versus US that's been out ma massive outperformance year to date that's going to continue for the second half of the decade. It's not because the US has lost its exceptionalism or any nonsense like that. Same thing happened the second term of uh Ronald Reagan's presidency. It just runs in 10 to 15 year cycles and we've had this aberrational zerp environment which is over and uh and and everyone keeps looking in the rearview mirror waiting for what's happened in the last 10 years to continue for the next 10 years and that's exactly when it doesn't. So, uh, you got a zigg when others are zagging. Continue to look at for opportunity in the 493. Small and mid versus large. Uh, look look for some focus there. International versus domestic, continue to have focus there if you didn't start your year off there. Uh, uh, you you want to start to find some exposure to international for the next 3 to 5 years. And, uh, and and US indices will do just fine. They'll just be slightly more subdued than than looking in the rearview mirror. So, uh, so that's kind of our view. That's that's how we're positioned. That's our framework. Uh, all as always, opinion, not advice, but, uh, it's worked exceptionally well for us this year, and I think it's going to continue to do so, uh, for many years to come. And final question, the, uh, the S&P 500, this is the first week that the S&P has um, uh, retraced and outperformed its previous all-time high, which was back in uh, February. Yeah, midFebruary. So, uh, where's it headed from here? Is it too much froth or uh is this just the beginning of a new rally? No, I I look I think we'll push higher here into earnings season probably the next few weeks and then I think we got to consolidate some gains maybe uh you know August, September, October, grind sideways, maybe a little natural pullbacks etc. and probably finish the year a little little stronger. So, uh, again, if you're hoping that the indices are going to go up another 20% in the next 3 months, uh, I'd be looking under the surface for real opportunities that can double before the end of the year because the indices, if you're looking for another 20% uh, in the next uh, to finish out the year, I don't think you're going to get anything close to that, but I do think there are there are enough companies prime that you can find enough doubles that uh, that the indices aren't going to matter if you do your work.

And then I had the pleasure to join BBC News. Um, we're going to listen in here. Investors are awaiting the next phase of Trump's trade war as his 90-day tariff pause on several economies expires next week. So for more on what's ahead for markets, I'm joined by Thomas Hayes, the chairman of Great Hill Capital. Thank you for joining me, Thomas. Let's start with the US market. What's driving these gains? Well, Katie, uh, first off, thanks for having me. Markets climb a wall of worry. We've basically gone from tariffs and bombs to tax cuts and growth, and the market is focused on the latter, not the former. Uh, sentiment, you've got so many institutional managers offside. If you look at the most recent Bank of America Fund Manager survey, sentiment is still near COVID low levels and great financial crisis low levels. So, every bit of good news is going to push the markets higher. And finally, we're going into earnings season with very low expectations of 5% earnings growth. That's down from 9.3 just at the end of March. So, it sets the stage to force all of these managers who sold at the lows in early April. It's going to continue to force them back in because they've simply been off sides. It's fascinating that you say there's a lot of pessimism in the market, but yet we're seeing any sign of optimism pushing up the market. How much is uh President Trump's big beautiful bill, as he's called it? You mentioned that fiscal stimulus. How much do you think that is uh furthering the market forward? Yeah, there's no question about it. It's it's all about growth and deregulation and increasing GDP. The tax cuts are good for for companies earnings. Uh we're seeing real wages rise again for the workingclass people in America. So a lot of the policies are really being wellreceived by the markets, well received by companies. And you know what's coming back more than ever is CEO and seuite confidence which had been in an abysmal level uh in in the first quarter and going into April. Now they're starting animal spirits are coming back. You're seeing deals. You're seeing investment. Uh you're seeing planning now that they understand better the rules of the road going forward and they're seeing some flexibility and rationality. And then you couple that with global liquidity. M2 money supply at an all-time high. It had been flatlining since uh 2022. And we had 64 central bank rate cuts last month. Not one out of the US, but 64 uh globally year to date rather and 15 last month alone around the world. Uh again, none out of the US. So, we're pretty hopeful seeing some of these Fed members come out against Powell, whether it's Bowen or Goulsby or Waller, indicating that maybe earlier if the inflation numbers continue to show uh positive signs, maybe they go in in June as a surprise, but certainly the odds of September have gone up for a cut. You mentioned wage rises as part of that beautiful bill. But of course, we are going to big big part of the contentions is the cuts to Medicaid. Another interesting element there of course is President Trump's pledge to uh reduce taxes on uh service workers. Thank you for joining me Thomas Hayes, chairman of Great Hill Capital. And Thomas of course mentioned the Fed. We've heard we've also seen Donald Trump continuing to extend his attack against the Federal Reserve's chair Jerome Pal. And we're back uh going on to CNA in Singapore, which is the largest station uh in Asia. like the BBC of Asia will listen in here now for analysis. Let's bring in Thomas Hayes, chairman and managing member at Great Hill Capital. Thomas, uh, thanks for joining us today. So, there you go. We've got the bill at least passed the Senate. Um, there's a lot of market anticipation before this on the uh the added debt it would put on the US, but at the same time, the potential economic boost this could bring to the US economy. for you, how do you weigh those two factors? Yeah. Well, listen, markets climb a wall of worry. We've shifted from focus on tariffs and bombs to tax cuts, growth, and deregulation, and the market likes it. If I didn't know any better, from listening to the to the previews, I would say this is a bad bill. It couldn't be further from the truth. You know, when you have debt to GDP of 121%, 120%. The last thing you can do is cut your way to prosperity, the only thing you can do is grow your way out of the problem like we did in the 1950s. The last time we had debt to GDP of 120%, within 10 years, we had above trend growth through smart policies and we brought our debt to GDP down to 63%. The same thing's going to happen right now. You've got a $10,000 deduction on interest on new cars. That's going to create a lot of manufacturing jobs in the auto industry, which volumes have been anemic since since co. Those are going to skyrocket with the average car on the road now 13.5 years old. Expect new cars to boom. Then you've got this $1,000 account for brand new for new babies born between 2024 and 2028. They're going to get $1,000 in basically like an IRA that's going to compound. So by the time they're 18 and 30, they're going to have a significant nest egg. This is a brilliant innovative idea that's going to set up our next generation for prosperity. You've got the extension of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. Yes, you have some cuts in food stamps. Yes, you have some cuts in Medicaid, which are not ideal, but it's a negotiation and this is very constructive. You know, you I heard uh the previous speaker talk about the markets were kind of muted. If you owned anything other than the Magnificent 7, the unmagnificent 493 components of the S&P 500, your portfolio was up massively today. And the reason is is because it's going to create a massive amount of jobs for regular working people on Main Street and the market like that. If you believed that growth was going to slow, mag 7 would have been what was up and it was just the opposite. This is very positive, Sarah. Yes, I hear your optimism there, Thomas. But what about the massive addition to US government debt as well? How much of a concern is that for you when you know the US has had its ratings knocked down and you can see that uncertainty and the uneasiness in the bond market? Listen, number one, the 10-year yield is at four foreign change. So, there's no uneasiness in the bond market at present. So, that that's a that's a nonsequator. Uh, as far as the assumptions as it relates to adding to the deficit, it's assuming subpar growth. That assumption could not be further from the truth if you actually understand what's in the bill in terms of spurring job growth, spurring innovation, spurring investment, spurring onshoring and domestic manufacturing. What you find is the assumptions in those projections are incorrect uh by an agency that's been chronically wrong over the years. So I think you have to uh keep an open mind that when you have 120% debt to GDP, if you don't have growth, you are on a path to Japan. The only way to fight that situation is to spur massive growth. And the policies in this bill are to spur massive growth. Then you're going to couple that with deregulation in the second half. uh uh changing capital requirements for banks, allowing them to lend more, allowing them to hold treasuries, uh allowing uh the the stable coins with the Genius Act, creating massive demand for US treasuries, you're going to see rates come down. Uh you're going to see a shadow Fed announced by uh by President Trump. If Powell doesn't cut in July, Trump will announce his pick for Fed and the market will start to discount 200 basis points of cuts and Powell will be a lame duck until next May. So given all that, Thomas, that you're excited about it, will that potential economic growth translate to market gains at least for the second half of this year? What you're going to see is the companies that have lagged behind, the real economy companies that create jobs for middle class are going to boom, but they are a lower weight in the S&P 500. So, you have 490 some odd companies that make up uh 70% of the index and you have 7 to 10 companies that make up 30 or 40% of the index. So you could see a more slightly more subdued return in the general indices because MAG 7 will do less well on a relative basis due to declining earnings growth as a function of increased capex while the 493 you could have many many companies doubling in stock price and the indices may be up much more modestly. So the short answer, Sarah, is it's a stock pickers market and there's going to be uh money made in the next 6 months by by quality stock pickers that we haven't seen in a long long time. Opportunity is here now. All right. And Thomas, what is your outlook then for the US dollar which has weakened so far this year? Uh I think the trend is going to be lower over the next couple years. I think a decent analog is, you know, 2001 to 2004. It had been overvalued relative to fundamentals for some time going into this year. Uh we had a view that the dollar would weaken and it will continue to weaken. You're going to get some counter trend bounces as more and more people get bearish on the dollar now that it's down 10 11%. Uh I think after those counter trend bounces, it's going to resume the downtrend and I think you're going to see continued performance. This year it's been massive outperformance of international equity indices versus US equity indices. I think that trend is going to persist for some time and most people still are not positioned for it. So expect continued weakening dollar, expect continued great performance from of international equities relative to the US and in the US those laggered companies, the unmagnificent 493 to dramatically outperform if you're picking the right ones prospectively. So if you're just jammed in US indices, you're going to do okay, but not great. If you have some international exposure and some exposure under the surface in US, you're going to do exceptionally well in our opinion. Okay, we'll watch that space, Thomas. Appreciate it. Thomas H there of Grey Hill Capital. And those are your business updates for this hour. For more, keep up across all of our CNA. And we're back. And then finally, I did CNA radio with Haranto Don and Andrea Hang. Uh this was one of the most fun interviews I've done. So, we'll listen in here. That's correct. Uh, let's take a look at Wall Street now. A mixed bag. The Dow closing 0.9% higher. Not so good. Uh, with the NASDAQ, though, at 0.8% decline, and the S&P 500 after notching that record high yesterday at 6204, it's come down some, just a little bit underwater at 6198. It's dropped 0.1%. That's what it translates to. Thomas Hayes joins us now for a closer look at what's happening. Uh he's chairman and managing member of great at Great Hill Capital. Thomas, before we get into it, I want to ask you for your opinion. How long do you think um youths need to stay in a job before they switch? I I think uh 20 to 40 years is about the correct answer. I'm guessing that's how long you stayed in your job. Well, you look, I run my own company, so it's it's easy to stay with your own job. Exactly. Yeah. Look, if you want to be here, here's my advice. If I see an application where the person is changing every 12 to 24 months, it's going in the waistband. It shows no loyalty. It shows uh uh no consistency, no persistence, and it's a hard pass for me. I'm not going to invest in training them or working with them. So, uh look, a lot of people get away with it. It's it's called salary jumping because every job they'll pay you more than your last job. And I guess it's a way to game the system, but the question is, do you game yourself in the long term? And the answer is I would say yes. Yeah. Okay. So here's the other question. I just I'm just curious. Is this a trend that's happening where you are right now? Not in my company. Fair enough. Fair enough. Okay. So let's get down to business. Uh let's first talk about that top headline coming out of DC and that's uh the US trade deal or particularly Mr. Trump's comments uh relating to the deal with Japan. We're looking at a potentially 30 to 35% tariff on Japan uh up from the original 24%. Trump's not confident of a deal by July 9th. Are you? Uh yes. I think this is how Trump negotiates. So he did the same thing with Canada. They didn't want to release the digital service tax and he said fine. And they eventually did yesterday. Yeah. walking away from the table. Canada comes back and look, when he says he they don't hold the cards, he's absolutely right. The same is the case with Japan. We stopped taking their cars, their toast. Uh he's asking them to take a little rice. Why the Japanese would want US rice, I have no idea, but Trump wants them to take our rice, so they should take our rice because they're sending a lot of cars to the United States and we're buying a lot of their cars. Well, they're having a rice shortage in Japan and they're struggling a little bit. So, they should take that rice. Absolutely. All rice all the time. Okay. How are they going to make that beautiful sushi without US rice? There it is. Okay. So Tom, on the flip side, Treasury Secretary Scott Basson says deal with India is closed and it will and if it does go through, it will join Canada and the UK. What's going to be significant about this deal, do you think? Well, look, what's going to be significant is India maintains a positive relationship with the United States, which is critical for their growth. Uh we we certainly want to maintain a positive relationship with India. We want non-tariff barriers removed. We want a fair playing field for US businesses to be able to participate in India's great growth. And uh and I think that's going to be the outcome of this. And uh believe it or not, I I do think the tariff negotiations are a lot more about non-tariff barriers than they are about us collecting $300 billion of tariffs uh 10% from from countries around the world. Trump loves the money, but I think he likes the open uh fair level playing fields even more. Yeah. Well, the money is going to be a nice little bonus. Uh have have don't have never mind. You know, that's what they say in Singapore. Um, okay Tom, let's take a look at Wall Street now. There seems to be a rotation out of mega cap stocks or at least larger stocks to smaller buys. I mean, we saw the Russell 2000 beating the NASDAQ uh overnight. What's the rationale for this? I mean, what are investors thinking? And how much volume are we talking about here? Oh, let me tell you, Andrea, you're you're tugging at my heartstrings to hell with the Mag 7. I'm telling you, look, the unmagnificent 493 are going to outperform through the end of the year. And I'll tell you why. It's simple math. The Mag 7 had 27% earnings growth in first quarter of this year. They're going to have 10.2% earnings growth by first quarter of next year. Unmagnificent 493 had negative earnings growth the end of last year. By Q1 of next year, they're going to have 10.3% earnings growth, which means more earnings growth for much lower multiple, approximately half the multiple. And why is MAG 7's earnings growth declining so precipitously because they are massively spending on cap X? And most people would say, well, it's offensive. I would say it's defensive. They don't want to lose share and they're spending and we don't know what the return on investment is going to be. So as you saw today preview of coming attractions small caps dramatically outperforming and this big beautiful bill has put rocket fuel in that rotation. Um you know whether it's $10,000 uh interest deduction on new automobiles volumes have been anemic in the United States since co it's going to supercharge it. Why? because the average car on the road is 13.5 years. Powell will get his head on straight and actually start cutting rates, which will help people get into cars. It'll help the millennials, as you said, as they hop from job to job. Also, buy a house and make babies. We need them to make babies. And by the way, with the new tax bill, if they make babies before 2028, their babies are going to get an investment account funded with $1,000 that's going to compound over time. So by the time they're 20, 30, 40, they're participating in the American dream with a massive head start. Wow. A dream before the person even exists. That's really nice. The Russell 2000 trending upwards of 1% by the way at the close of business. Tom, so talking about jobs, uh, US job openings hit the highest in 7 months, largely due to summer holidaying, but layoffs were lower, too. What do you think we'll see when summer's over? Yeah, that's that's the million-dollar question because uh to force the Fed's hand, you do do need to see some weakness in the jobs growth. But we've gone from tariffs and bombs to tax cut tax cuts, deregulation, and growth. So, animal spirits are coming back. CEO confidence is coming back. It was in the toilet in early April. Uh they were they were hiding under their desks uh quivering in the fetal position. Now, they want to do deals. They want to make investments. They want to grow again. uh and that's a positive thing for the economy and this tax bill only exe uh enhances that because the tax job uh tax cuts and jobs acts is extended in perpetuity. So, a lot of constructive things happen. I'm really eager to see that jobs report on Friday because that's going to tell us a lot about when the Fed goes. Exactly. We'll get to the big beautiful bill in just a moment. Uh the US economy is likely going to chug along from the looks of it. Uh, and that's going to not to not to dampen your spirits yet, Tom, but it's it might just uh buy the Fed more time to cut rates. Uh, plus not forgetting Trump sticking with that 9 July deadline, which they feel needs to be priced into inflation. Uh, do you think a September cut now is too soon or do you think it's too late? September's too late. That's probably when it's going to happen. Uh, it should happen in July. Look, at the end of the day, this is about one. The Fed is supposed to be by mandate data dependent. They have now become prediction dependent. And it's been wrong. I mean, this is the guy in December of 2018 that said autopilot with quantitative easing and crashed the stock market 20% in a few weeks right before Christmas. Minutian had to come bail him out. Then he said inflation is transitory at the exact wrong time. Now he's worried about his legacy and not being Arthur Burns uh who cut too quickly in the 70s and it came back. The economic conditions and demographics are nothing like the 70s which tells you everything you know and why he shouldn't be in that position. He would have made a great Treasury Secretary by the way and I hear he's an incredible golfer. Fed chair not so much. But here we are. And what's going to happen is if he doesn't cut in July and uh alleviate the US taxpayer from paying $600 billion more in interest payments than we should be paying. Trump is going to announce his pick and it's going to be a shadow Fed president and Powell will be a lame duck till the end of his term in May of 2026. The market will immediately start to discount 200 basis points of cuts well before it happens. and nothing Powell does will matter. So if he's that interested in his legacy, he should do a 25 basis point cut in July, whether we have a little bit of inflation bump from tariffs or we don't. Because according to them in their brilliant summary of economic projections, they themselves acknowledge any bump will be like a one-time tax and temporary. They also in their brilliant predictions say that real GDP is going to decelerate to 1.4%. So if they're so damn confident in their projections, why didn't they cut 50 basis points if real GDP is going to drop to 1.4%. You tell me. That's a million dollar question that we can't answer. Yeah. Okay. So, you know, talking about being good at golfing, let's swing to that big, beautiful bill. Now, it's passed the Senate, but before we get into the details, uh any chance we'll see a little choke at the House of Representatives, of course, that's how you get stuff. I mean, your your number one job as a politician is to get reelected. How you get reelected is you bring the bacon home to your constituents. So, yes, there's going to be problems in the House, but they'll get it through and they probably get it through before Independence Day. Um I mean, th this is just a phenomenal bill in every way. Look, every headline I'm reading is people aren't going to eat and uh no one's going to be able to go to the hospital. But the fact of the matter is it's going to create a ton of jobs, a ton of growth, and you can't cut your way to prosperity. All these people talking about the deficit are looking at one side of the equation. What they're not looking at is we need growth. The last time the US had debt to GDP of 120% was 1948. We got back to down to 63% within 10 years. Not through cutting our way to prosperity, but through growing our way through prosperity. Oh, and by the way, inflation ran above trend for those 10 years between 3 to 5%. But so did nominal GDP, and that helped bring the equation down. You cut your way, you're going to lose jobs, you're going to have deflation, and then you're going to really have a debt problem. So, you need tax cuts, you need deregulation, you got to let animal spirits go, and we got to run run GDP as hot as hell to bring that to GDP down uh to a reasonable level in the next 5 years, right? So, while uh while we're thinking about that, it is going to be passed through likely and there's going to be tax and spending cuts galore. Uh while that's closer to being realized, what kind of risks do you think traders will need to brace for then in the meantime? Well, you're going to have the day-to-day nonsense about the tariffs. Here's what you need to know. Markets climb a wall of worry. Okay, so two months ago, all these brilliant people when the market was down 20% were telling you to sell your stocks in the hole. These are the same idiots that are chasing stocks up at new highs that are being forced back into the market. Why? Because they want to keep their jobs. Unlike the real world, in investment management, people actually want to keep their jobs longer than two 12 to 24 months. And how they do that is they closet index. and now they're behind the benchmarks and every single headline they're forced to buy more stock and that's going to continue for a while. Why? Because they sold a trillion dollars in the hole at the exact wrong time on April 7th and now they got to play catch-up or find a new job. So, uh the good news is we've got a $10,000 tax deduction on interest payments on new autos. So, if they want a new job, they'll be able to find it on the assembly line in in Detroit, Michigan making cars because there's going to be a lot of jobs created with that deduction. Well, Tom, this has been fun. Thank you so much for entertaining us uh this morning and really sharing your perspectives and your insights. We really appreciate it. We look forward to our next chat with you. Thank you very much. Have a great day. Yeah, same to you as well. And that was Thomas Hayes, uh chairman and managing member at Great Hill Capital, bringing us to the end of Open for Business on CN98. Yep. Coming right up, it's the morning rip and we're back. Quote of the week. I don't look to jump over seven foot bars. I look around for one foot bars that I can step over. That's Warren Buffett. We go for easy businesses that we understand that can be a quick turnaround. Uh two, three years, doubles and triples. Uh Buffett, your mind is like a bank. What you deposit is what you can withdraw. uh you continue to do that over time and um and you you make this vast uh savings account that compounds like money. Your knowledge compounds over time if you continue to feed it with the right inputs. I want to thank these incredible supporters. We got a lot more orders for these incredible hedge fund tips hats, golf shirts, mugs that you name it. And uh but a lot less people have sent in the pictures, but they're starting to trickle in. We got a shy audience out here. Don't know why this is not coming up. Let's see. Maybe it got held up in uh All right, we'll go back to that. I don't know why the pictures are not loading, but uh on to some data. Here's the sloomer over at RBC. You can see 10-year yield going down down in the range. Maybe a little counter trend bounce here, but the trend is lower. We're going to probably hit the bottom end of this range, 359. Mortgage rates below six, but before the end of the year. SLR's kicking in soon. Uh S&P 500 breaking out. No one believed me in early April when I was saying bye bye bye. You can go back to the tapes. Now we are up some 20some percent. What an incredible year this has been. And um uh let's see here. Home builders starting to break this downtrend. This is a key theme for the second half. Biotech now starting to break the downtrend. How you doing? Uh and so on. So we got some good news there. Then we've got uh pod chart. So Chris Nelson to become CEO effective October 1st should be welcomed by investors. That's an upgrade to $90 price target for Stanley Black & Decker. They're going to have to take that up again. Uh here is Bank of America downgrading uh Albamaro in the hold despite um you can see here lithium prices are bottoming. Look at this starting to turn back up, but they still have a $93 price target on it. That thing's been on a tear lately. Intel got upgraded $28 price target from Northland. Talking about the different nodes and the opportunities and basically Intel is the only alternative to Taiwan semiconductor. That's been core to our thesis since day one. You can read that. No one's talking about it, which is when we like to get involved. All the new money that's come in in the last week, it's been incredible. For the first time in a long time, I was able to put new clients into Alibaba because of the short-term pullback. Super excited about that. Intel, we got another bite at the apple. Now it's running away uh to the upside. So, super exciting time for those of you who have taken action. We're going to close out the raise earlier than normal. Usually, we keep it open for two weeks. We're closing it down in six days. If you're coming in, you need to do it now. If not, uh we'll revisit uh uh in uh October. Uh at some point, we're probably going to stop taking the million-dollar accounts. The business is just changing composition. We're getting a lot bigger allocations. Um but the people who have come in at a million will be grandfathered in and you'll be able to to stay with the small account. Uh brand, you know, inventory, most major brands are down after strong spring prices. Oh, inventory down on cars. So, they sold a lot ahead of the tariffs. Inventories are down. Production is going to have to come up. That's a good chart. Uh, durable goods orders through the roof. Uh, continuing jobless claims climb to highest level in 3.5 years. So, that should although we had some good labor numbers uh today, this should start to u certainly move them in September. We'll see about July. Probably not after today. spending on data centers expected to hit 1 trillion by 2030. Natural gas, all the other derivative plays we've talked about, GenerRack, backup generators, stocks have gained in July 10 years in a row. This will likely be the 11th. Uh gas demand inflation continues to be in the twos. Uh the Fed continues to pretend to predict the future. We covered enough of that in the media stuff. 64 rate cuts year to date, but none in the US. That's liquidity on a global basis is uh robust. S&P uh 500 on cusp of seventh great breakout since 1990% number of stocks at all-time highs. This this breath increased after the quarter ended. It was narrow the last couple of weeks of the quarter and then all of the sudden uh a a switch flipped and after the window dressing was done the all the money started flowing in the 493 small caps etc. And you saw weakness. Look at the euro. When I was pounding the table on this fourth quarter last year everyone was like no way and here we are uh approaching 120 on the euro. uh foreign investors have bought $128 trillion of US assets since 1991. Fresh highs be get additional gains usually. So 12 months out, you can see now that we've broken out to a new high average is up another 13% 12 months later. Super exciting. Uh MSCI Europe versus MCI US. Uh there's nothing on this one, uh Jeff, so make sure you have descriptions. All right. Macro funds rapidly changed tack on stock. So they were sellers of a trillion in the hole in early April. Now they're massive buyers. That doesn't necessarily imply a top because they do this every single draw down. You can see you get this huge spike up and the market continues to climb a bit higher. Retail looks to be holding back for now. Treasury yields and the dollar index. This is important. The dollar index uh breaking through the lows. Um again, what what a difference a quarter and a half makes, two quarters make, how strong it was going into the year, and we said, "Hang on, this is a fake out." And it's just absolutely collapsed. So, what's the catch-up trade? The 10-year Treasury yield. Look at this divergence. These divergences are where we've made our money. uh uh materially over the years and I think you're going to catch down on treasury yields. Indian stocks trail aen everyone couldn't get enough India uh they've underperformed EM peers for the first time in years that's going to continue PBOC expected to ease monetary policy again this year average annual return in volatility of S&P 500 stocks 1973 to 2024 uh dividend payers have had the highest returns ladies and gentlemen that's not been the case of late I think you're going to want to have some of those and um non-payers. So, that was flipped on its head with Zerp. Zerp is over. Don't get caught looking in the rear view mirror. You'll wind up driving into a wall. All right. Goldman Sachs. Uh uh we're going to skip that. A third of US burden by high housing costs. Thank you, Jay Powell. Electricity costs have soared since the pandemic. They're now starting to normalize a bit since the policy has changed. Bottomup Consensus expects Q 2Q S&P earnings growth will decelerate to 4% yearonear. Um, yeah, the numbers I look at say 5%, but that's down from 93, which sets the bar very low going into earnings season, which probably means we get some beats early out of the gate. we get a little bit more uh juice in the S SNP through the end of July. Uh and then we'll probably consolidate some of those gains certainly in the indices under the indices probably rotate and benefit from our positioning. Average cumulative S&P total returns uh invest on any day uh you have lower return. Invest at a new high you have higher returns. Um, so we've just had a new high in the S&P earnings revisions, breath upside inflections driven by more upward revisions. This is 12 month performance uh of the S&P again up 12%. So the other metric up 13%. It's just a mosaic of data points that we use to kind of take, you know, compile our outlooks and and these are inputs that that we consider something to keep in mind. implied dividend yield. Uh S&P 500 at the lowest. Euro stocks a bit higher. Nikk a bit higher than that. First half of July tends to have the highest 2- week S&P return since 1950. Almost 2% highest week uh two weeks of the year. Share of firsttime home buyers has declined from 50% to currently 24% compliments Jay Powell. Higher stock prices and rising real estate values boost households. Uh so you can see the household balance sheets are healthier than they have ever been. We covered that last week as well. S&P 500 bull markets. You can see where we are just having that draw down and where the average bull market goes over time. uh which shows a lot of runway which has been our base case. this thing goes to the 2030s that doesn't preclude 10% and 20% pullbacks like we've seen but the trend is there demographically economically speaking S&P 500 positive EPS guidance 5year okay we'll skip that CPI skip that coming down we know that defense spending as a share of GDP historic and projected you're seeing it in our Boeing is through the roof uh so we're excited about that and Hey, not to mention, it didn't hurt that they had the 30,000 uh bunker bombs that absolutely destroyed and set back Iran at least 2 years with their nuclear ambitions. Uh more bombs in the back pocket if needed. Boeing will be happy to supply and as owners, we will be happy to profit. Uh European stocks beat us by the most since 2006. This was another minority opinion we had last year. That's that's proven in spades this year. This will continue over time. This is like the early 2000s. Uh relative to the US ex US shares look as attractive as ever. How you doing ladies and gentlemen? US doesn't always win. These are the normal cycles. This doesn't mean we've lost our exceptionalism. We're never going to lose that because we are a melting pot of the best from around the world. Immigration has made us great legal immigration. My mother immigrated legally from Portugal when she was 16. Uh many great people uh have immigrated legally and contributed and most have migrated uh immigrated legally. So that's the theme. We should dramatically increase legal immigration. And um uh here are the cycles where you can see US underperformed. By the way, this was under Reagan's second term, which everyone would be shocked. US did fine, international did better. Same thing uh in the early 2000s that that stopped and then you went into ZERP where US outperformed uh dividend yield inexpensive versus history. So these are the Stanley Black & Deckers of the world. the Albamaro dividend aristocrat. We've covered dividend yield neglected by active managers. This game is going to be back on just like when 2001 to 2007. I can't emphasize that enough. For those of you who are new, uh you can go back to the old tapes on hedge funips.com and you can see how this stuff has played out. Growth versus value near record COVID highs. This is going to reverse and it's going to do so abruptly. And the last few days has been a preview of coming attraction. So, if you're jammed in indices passively and you don't realize you're fully exposed to MAG 7 or you're overweight MAG 7, uh, have a nice day. You're going to be less than satisfied prospectively. Dollar and those that have selective uh positioning, correct positioning in small cap value 493, the correct names international, you are going to make so much money. You're going to be smiling so wide you could eat a banana sideways. And you've already seen that year to date the clients and and we're going to see a lot more of that moving forward. Dollars worst start to the year in decades. Again, it was a very very lonely position uh in Q4 of last year. Supply of homes highest in once hot markets. So, this is good. This will start to normalize. rate cuts and SLR and Bessence play on the 10-year yield will um uh exacerbate this trend. Flexing their strain, Chinese brand shares growing in electrified auto segments. Uh just 55 trading days back to the new highs. Average is 361. One of the fastest recoveries in history. And as we said on August 7th when we were telling you to buy everything and send I I'm most proud of the clients because I really pounded the table. If you're thinking about sending in new money, send it in now. And the only other time I've done that in my career. I've never asked anyone to invest. They just come to me from the podcast and from referrals. I've never sat down with someone with a pitchbook and said, "This is why Great Hill Capital is great." I don't do that. I've never optimized for for maximum aum. People, you know, start start with me. They see value, they get returns, they add more money, they give me referrals. That's how I do it. That's how I've always done it. And uh and why do they invest with me? Because they've already gotten tremendous value and made a ton of money off the podcast before they even call me. So, um but that was a time when I said, "Send money now." I literally did an emergency call on the 7th of April, went through for 35 minutes every company in the portfolio, and I said, "This is Christmas. We need to buy as much as humanly possible. If you were thinking about sending in new money and we got so much money in such a short period of time that we were able to buy so much 28% below today, it was unbelievable. So kudos to you who had the courage in the face of fear. Uh and um and there's still so much opportunity out there. It's it's just exciting. Month monthly pension estimate. Okay, we covered that. Institutional clients are big net sellers post crisis. They we covered their their need to chase up uh in the media stuff. Weaker dollar. The weaker the dollar, the stronger the earnings growth, which we covered back half. There it's going to be a tailwind of the weaker dollar in the first half. You're going to see that cutting rates while uh US core CPI yearonear US funds 250 basis points higher than inflation. So unreal. Uh SN earnings sentiment S&P it accelerated off the lows. Now it's flatlining. Post-election years have been very strong lately. Uh that's this year average has been since 1985 up 18.1%. That's kind of interesting. Midterm years are the worst year, more subdued. So if you think you're going to get returns from indices next year, you're not. If you uh have an active manager that knows how to buy the correct lagards and turnarounds, you're going to make a fortune in that type of environment when the indices are doing nothing. um consolidated equity positioning still there's still power here to to move higher. People are really got caught off sides in April and May uh and June. What else you want to know? Ahead of the street again uh what do we got here? Total market cap of US versus the other regions. This what what's interesting about this is the percentage of global market cap that US equities have is not commensurate with the percentage of earnings power the US has. So there's a divergence there and that's going to normalize a reversion to the mean. Uh weights of these other regions are going to start to increase relative to the US because their earnings power is dramatically higher in percentage terms than the waiting in the global indices. So that mean reversion is coming to a theater near you. Look at home builders uh overthrow now they're coming back. That's going to be the second half story with rates. We're positioned like nobody's business for that which is going to be super exciting. Not in the homebuilders in other ancillary plays which are going to uh have much more operating leverage and better margins. Hong Kong listings in June hit the highest since December 2022. The game is on, ladies and gentlemen. Rotation in small cap, same story. We've talked about it the last few days. Share of TV consumption, traditional versus streaming. Who's winning? Disney, baby, how you doing? That thing's up some 50% in the last couple of months. Um, 81% of mortgaged homes have a rate below six. This is why I'm talking. Once we get below six, the game will be on. Uh, ADP non-farm payroll was weak. Today's jobs report was strong. Small cap showing relative signs of life. This is a positive divergence. Capex from all major hyperscalers. This is what's hurting their earnings growth. Uh slingshot is in play in 2025. Uh what do we have here? Performance after a negative Q1 and then up 10% in Q2. Uh final six-month return is up on average another 15% from Ryan's lips to God's ears. We shall see another bullish sign. Golden cross. Okay, you can see the data here one year later up 11%. These are just all data points in the mosaic. S&P sector performance in 2025. Discretionary, there's going to be a lot of opportunity here. The goosees, the van, the VFS, um, uh, etc. housing materials, Albamaro starting to absolutely rip higher. Uh, Crown Castle. I think second half is going to be a home run as rates come down. So, we got a lot of good stuff there. Transports, you're seeing it in. Okay. Uh, sell America story count. You can see all this. That's hysterical. Uh, at the lows now the story counts gone down. You can't make this stuff up. US allies to bump up their defense spending. That helps the likes of Boeing. I think those bunker busters are going to be a popular one. Um, oh, country index. Okay, that was a lot of data. Good job. China is quickly eroding America's lead in the global AI race. We've covered this. Alibaba, you start up deepseeek and e-commerce giant Alibaba as alternatives to American offerings such as chat GPT. I continue to say Alibaba is the cheapest AI play in the world. Not only is are their models superior in in objective tests, but uh they also have a piece of every single China AI startup because they give they give them free compute from their cloud business which is number one China. Think AWS for China in exchange for equity in all these companies. Most people don't know it's not yet accounted in the stock. But when you get a couple thousand baggers, people are going to start to pay attention. Alibaba ready $7 billion boost for commerce use plans new data centers.

First and foremost, just want to thank uh let's thank all the media people. Katie Silver at BBC and Xiao D Silva for having me on. Maryanne Star in Kay and Sarah for having me on uh CNA and Maryanne Star in a Kay and Andrea Hang and Haranto Dean for having me there. Not sure what is up with the podcast with the page here. Okay, while we got the pages working, want to acknowledge those who sent in their photos wearing the headphone tips merch. Uh we got a couple newer ones here. We covered a lot of these. Uh Aaron Oda and his beautiful family. Got just a bunch. We'll just recognize them real quick. All right, let's get to the article of the week. Goose on the loose stock market and sentiment results. Uh, so again, thanks to Katie Silver and Jao Dilva, Marian Star. Okay, we covered that. Canadia goo Canada Goose update. Each week we try to cover one to two companies we've discussed in previous podcast videocast and or own for clients including personally. By the way, while you're at hedge fun.com, all this is opinion, not advice. Click on terms. Check with your financial advisor. Uh um check with everyone else. Take no resp personal responsibility. Don't do anything. Disclaimer, disclaimer, disclaimer. All right. So, uh here's Canada Goose. You can see here price is down. C free cash flow is at record highs. We love these divergences. We make made our fortune doing this over and over. We're going to continue to do that for clients. Uh, and um, we love buying things that are not in the headlines that no one wants and selling when they're in the headlines every day and everyone wants free cash flow just rocking and rolling. Earnings recovering, revenues recovering. Here's why. A few weeks ago, we put out a quick update following Canada Goose's Q4 earnings, but have not yet put out a full deep dive. Despite the 70% move off the April lows, we don't even think the train has left the station yet with this name. That said, we thought now would be a good time to revisit it. Canada Goose, like many other names, went from a flashy growth story to a left for dead value story post pandemic and during the cyclical consumer draw down that followed. Uh, similar to PayPal, by the way, which is on an absolute tear lately. Luckily for us, this once in aundred-year event gave us the opportunity to purchase what we believe is one of the highest quality familyrun luxury brands amid an 85% draw down and near all-time lows. The good news is we believe that over time Goose has the potential and all the right pieces to return to growth story as management executes its turnaround plan and gets a little help from the recovery of Chinese consumer and the shift toward a consumption-based economy. The name of the game with Goose turnaround is reducing exposure to wholesale and leaning into high margin DTC stores. Back in 2017, DTC made up just 29% of total revenue. This past fiscal year, that number had grown to 74% with management targeting 80% by fiscal year 2028. The biggest upside from that shift is the margin profile with DTC typically commanding margins in the mid 70% range compared to wholesale in the mid to high 40% range. Beyond the material profitability upside, the model also enables better brand quality control, higher conversion rates, improved inventory management, and greater operational efficiency. But those are just words. The real question is whether management can execute, and they're doing just that. Inventories have declined for six straight quarters down to just $384 million and 14% lower year-one. DTC revenues jumped 15.7% in Q4 with comp sales up 6.8%. Re wholesale revenues fell 23.2% in the quarter to just 31.8 8 million with fiscal year 2026 expected to be the trough as nearly all intentional cuts are now behind goose. Most importantly and as expected, gross margins hit record highs coming in just under 70% for the full year and showing no signs of slowing as management pushes toward its low 70% range target. So with DTC taking care of business on the profitability front, the next question and other prong of the turnaround plan is centered around reacelerating revenue on grow revenue growth. On that front, management is effectively turning Goose from a purely winter one-time purchase luxury parker brand into an allseason 365day relevant brand. This past year, Goose nearly doubled its mix of updated and brand new styles. Whether it's rain jackets, eyewear, shoes, or even warm weather clothing, Canada Goose now has it. Most importantly, people can't get enough. Apparel emerged as the fastest growing category in Q4. And for the full fiscal year 2025 with downfilled outerware also seeing very solid growth. This continues to drive more repeat customers and multi-unit purchases, something Goose had never traditionally had. And once again, the success is showing up in the data with this past year's holiday season search interest hitting a 3year high. Oh, and by the way, the turnaround is being led by a CEO chairman from the founding family who owns 39.5% of the entire company. How's that for skin in the game? Just as you'd expect when management has that skin in the game, they tend to respect shareholder equity. Over the last 5 years, they have reduced the share count by nearly 12%, making your slice of the pie that much bigger without putting up any additional capital. Remember, price is what you pay, value is what you get. In the case of Goose, all signs point to strengthening fundamentals. You have record high gross margins, revenues reacelerating, and near record free cash flow. Yet, the price remains subdued. I built my career on capturing divergences like this rather than overthinking it. We are happy to sit on our hands and wait for Mr. market to be done serving up one of his manic bouts. Here's everything you need to know about Q4 results. So, you can go through this at hedge funips.com uh and all the initiatives. Top 10 key points. Q revenue Q4 revenues grew 7.4% year-on-year to 384 beating expectations of 28.2 by 28.2 million. This was driven by DTC revenue growth of 15.7% and comp sales growth of 6.8. 8% year-on-year with higher conversion rates across every region. Two, gross margins continue to benefit from the push to DTC coming in ahead of expectations at 71.3% for the quarter, up 620 basis points year-over-year and 69.9% for the full year. Adjusted EBIT margins came in at 15.5% up 430 basis points year. Three, management continues to make solid progress. right sizing inventories which have declined 14% year-onear to 348 million 384 million and marked the sixth consecutive quarter of reductions. Inventory turnover also improved to 1.1 times from.9 times last fiscal year. Four management continues to clean up the balance sheet reducing net debt leverage to 1.3 times compared to two times in the prior year. Cash and cash equivalents totaled 334 million at the end of the quarter up from 144 million a year earlier. Five tariffs are not expected to have a direct material impact on fiscal year 2026 profitability. 75% of the units are made in Canada and virtually all comply with the United States messa making them currently exempt. The remaining 25% of units are produced in Europe which is expected to have minimal financial impact. Six wholesale revenues declined 22.3% in Q4 to 31.8 million and fell 16.5% for the full year. The decline is part of the intentional strategy to reduce the wholesale order book and shift toward higher margin DTC. Fiscal year 2026 is expected to be the trough for wholesale as streamlining efforts are mostly complete with management expecting growth from this point forward supported by strong interest from wholesale partners in the spring summer and fall winter 25 collections. Seven. Goose continues to successfully expand into the non-winter category as it works to become an allseason relevant brand, nearly doubling the mix of updated and brand new styles during the year. Interest in new products and categories remain strong with downfilled outerwear showing solid growth and apparel emerging as fastest growing category in Q4 and for the full fiscal year. Data also shows a rising number of repeat customers and multi-unit purchases driven by the ongoing apparel expansion. Eight for the full year, Goose converted two temporary stores and opened four net new permanent stores, bringing the total store count to 74. Management continues to expect total net store openings to exceed fiscal year 2025 levels in the upcoming year. Nine. Goose. Similar to advanced auto parts, you don't expand stores when you are um uh not doing well. Uh the in other words, all the costs are in the rearview mirror. Now we go into growth mode on both counts. Nine. Goose ended the year with a corporate headcount reduction at 3% compared to the start of the year following the 17% reduction in March 2024. This brought fullear SGA SGNA expenses down to 779 compared to 792 million in the prior year and 10 management did not provide guidance for the fiscal year 2026 outlook but remains confident in the strength of the brand and its solid financial position. Importantly, the decision to withhold guidance was driven by macro and tariff uncertainty rather than any weakness seen in consumer spending. In fact, management has been seen positive sales momentum continue into the early part of fiscal year 2026. Here's the earnings call transcript. You can go through that at hedge funfundtips.com. Uh, general market sentiment, fear and greed is elevated but not at extreme. Level 66. National Association of Active Investment Managers have had to chase up. Now they've kind of paused. Markets hitting new highs. They'll have to chase back up to extremes. Congratulations to all the new clients that came in during our Q1 and Q2 2025 raises. you cannot be better positioned for what we believe will continue to be a highly rewarding remainder of the year in 2025. This view is based on what has already taken place in 2025 as well as much of the data we have shared in recent weeks podcast video cast coupled with our proprietary methods of expressing and executing upon those views on your behalf. As of July 1st, we are now accepting smaller accounts of $1 million plus for our Q3 opening. We will close this opening earlier than normal this quarter, and we'll stop accepting these accounts after July 9th. So, between now and July 9th, if you're coming in at the million-doll size, if you're coming in at the normal size of 5 or 10 million plus, uh you can come in at your leisure at any time. But for the smaller accounts, we open it for small windows. Congratulations to all of you had had this pleasure of speaking with and onboarding last week when we opened up the queue for inquiries. Many of you have already had your applications approved by Interactive Brokers. So, we have begun deploying capital on your behalf in recent days. To see if you qualify and to take advantage of this opening clip here. Larger normal size accounts of 5 to 10 million plus can access bespoke service at their preference here. Not a solicitation, opinion, not advice. C terms. Consult with everyone under the sun before you do anything. Um, moving along. Retail earnings estimates, top 30 weights, uh, revisions in the last 60 days. Retail down by 52 basis points. And for this year, 83 basis points. For next year, I think there's going to be some ponies in that pile. transport earnings because as of what I discussed with David, how they pulled forward before the tariffs and uh uh now they're spending on services, they'll go back to goods. You got back to school coming up. Um so you want to take advantage of that. Uh this is for transports are down. Let's see who got hit the most here. Um, looks like FedEx uh had a big impact on this. I keep looking at there's going to be a pony in the pile for FedEx and UPS I think at some point. It's just not yet. But in the meantime, it drags and then what's this company? MATX. Yeah, those are kind of the big hits on that economic data. Uh, let's take a look. I want to see the jobs numbers today. You can see continuing claims higher than expected which we covered. Initial jobless claims were 233,000. Unemployment rate down to 4.1%. Private nonpart farm payrolls were much lower than expected in June. 74,000 versus 105,000 versus 137,000 last year last uh last month. All right. Non-manufacturing was a little weak and that's that tomorrow's Independence Day. So, with that said, uh, and then, um, estimates for 2026 remain up around 300 bucks. I'm pretty sure 264 this year. Do they not have? Yeah, they have it. $3005. Guidance will be the name of the game as we start earnings season. Uh, podcast over. Now, we're going to move to uh, ask me anything questions. So, if you like those and get value, stick around. For the rest of you, we'll see you next week. Same time, same place. We might be a day early next week because I've got to travel on the 10th. Robert Edwards asks, "Uh, thoughts on GPN? I know you own PayPal." We covered this last week. Uh, for us, it's it's a pass, so I'm going to just skip that because we get asked that every single week. Johnny C, uh, could the price on com go higher? Yes, they got a pullback this week on some delilution, but that story is halfway through. It's not over yet despite the huge runup. Cameron Franco difference between ADP and BLS. It's just short-term noise. There's there's no kind of rhyme or reason. It happens every month and it's been more pronounced in recent months. So, I would none of none of that analysis is anything that's going to make you any money. So, I wouldn't spend much time on it. Um, guy from Germany wants to become a client. I'll email you back. Um, been watching your picks fly. Uh, must be your best week ever. Uh, if there was an MVP for 2025 stock picks, you would be getting my vote all day. Well done, sir. Thank you very much. It's very kind of you, Lee. Uh, is Etsy still on your radar? Yes, that's uh we added that for brand new clients this week. Record free cash flow, buying back stock uh and uh turning around. So, we there there's nothing to think about there. We're we're perfectly happy with it and put it as a new position. Uh, Lucas, share it with all friends. Thank you. All right. He's asking about the VIP structure. Uh, we own most of that in Hong Kong. We own a little Baba still. We might switch it over, but um, I think that was more of a fear before China and the US had a quote deal framework. That was just a threat to push them to the table. So, I don't think there's real risk in that in the short term. Goran Stogic uh famous Warren Buffettly famously said that turnaround seldom turn. I don't think that's true. Uh they did seldom turn for Buffett who bought uh IBM when uh that lady was running it into the ground. But IBM was a big enough business. It's now turned around. Sooner or later, a business that that has that big of a moat that's been around that long, eventually they're going to change the CEO, Jenny Romdy. The problem is is Buffett liked her because he kept telling her to buy back stock and she kept doing it. She was a saleswoman, not an engineer. And um but she took her eye off the ball of innovation. And when they got the guy in from Red Hat, it changed the game and it's off. So uh turnaround seldom turn. Look, if you've been watching me for 5 years, we've done, you know, three dozen turnarounds that have been doubles, triples, quadruples, etc. Uh so yeah, if you don't know how to do it, they don't turn. But if you do know what you're doing, which takes decades of experience and uh a lot of nuance that you can't possibly understand uh until you do it that long, then it's one of the greatest ways to make money in the history of mankind in my view. I I would do it no other way. Um uh are there any turnarounds you ever gave up? Uh I you know I would say there was one I almost gave up on and that was Range Resources. We bought at 11 bucks in 2018. It was down from 90. Uh immediately not immediately went up to $18. We thought we were geniuses. Then COVID came. It dropped down to a buck 60. We backed up the truck. We bought our B brought our basis down to $4 and change and and now it's at uh over around $40. So it's a 10 bagger in seven years and probably going to 60 is which is where we initially underwrote it before we got involved. We know where we're getting out of businesses before we even get started. So because that because of how we do analysis um so uh so that'll be a 15 bagger in seven years. So, the impatient person like Buffett blew out of IBM at the lows and and it now probably would have been a a double plus for him. Uh maybe a triple. Um but he liked Jenny too much. He didn't want Jenny fired and and he was the kind of the the decision maker because of the amount of stock that he owned. So, um there there is one that he did stick with called BYD in China. 11 years the stock did nothing. had three 50% plus draw downs and then in the 12th year it was a 10bagger. So 10bagger over 101 12 years it starts to work and that was Charlie's doing who kept him in the game long enough. Uh but if you look back at Buffett's partnership days that's all he did that's how he outperformed. So it just comes down to the capital structure that you have and um uh that basically turnarounds are what made Buffett uh more than anything else because if he didn't have the returns in the partnership like you see from doing turnarounds right uh he would have never got control of the Birkshire Hathaway vehicle and the insurance float and the permanent capital and the rest is history. No one ever like him. No one ever will. The best in the world of all time. Jimmy Jones Uh, oh, so Jimmy Jones is asking, "Why is the share count up?" It's It's up like five shares. It's literally up five sh It's like nothing. The reason is is because they bought back every share under the sun at 60 to $80. Uh, and uh, now it's at 110 120. they they reduce the buyback because now they've found places that they can get a higher return on invested capital than the 10% earnings yield from buying in stock. So they they're expecting they can get 20% plus return on capital investing in AI investing in their core business. So they still have some level of executive comp and if they're not buying shares, it's going to increase the count modestly. But if you look how much they've brought it down, this is just a rounding error and you're you're focused on the wrong thing. Uh unknown. Would you ever do a distressed for control or loan to own type of investment? Buying fulcrum security. If you're buying a fulcrum security, the business is completely uh a train wreck and I want nothing to do with it. Jason Greenblat, love the content. Uh, Consensus Cloud Solutions, CCSI. Let's take a look. I know Jason's been watching for a while. Revenues have just been flat. cash flow collapsed. It's trying to recover. It's not uh it looks like the their moat has been breached and they don't have anything innovative and unique is what I'm reading in this. Uh uh this hasn't been around long enough for me to to be interested. I like to see how businesses operate through many cycles and I I don't like these that are around for two, three years and had a run and got collapsed and they look like they're stalling out. Uh Jim, okay, Jim, I already called. Uh he's coming in. Great. Uh Mark Callaway, let me just see something here. Okay. Can't Mark Callaway says, "Hi, Tom. I can't thank you enough for all the time and effort you give your community of followers for free. I have just made shy of $100,000 following your advice." Oh, congratulations. Um, I am inching closer daily to meeting the qualified clients requirements for you to manage my money and I'm looking forward to the day immensely. Me, too. And congratulations on that. Uh, if your free content is this valuable, I can only imagine what your results for actual paying clients is. Yes, that's absolutely correct, Mark. Um, and this year they're seeing it in spades. My question today is with Housing Supply and uh home ownership act being stripped from the big bill, does this lessen your conviction in Stanley Black & Decker, Generrack, and QXO? No. No. No. There's a lot of good stuff in the in the housing bill. mortgage interest deduction, the $5,000 credit to new home buyers. Uh there's a ton of housing positive stuff in that, but the most important thing is going to be rates coming down. So, congratulations on your success and uh look forward to welcoming you in the future and keep it up. Way to go. Joshua Kaplan, can you talk about sell rules, position resizing, tax considerations after big moves? uh it not in a vacuum. I can do it in the context of an exact portfolio and positioning and analysis of each individual stock. Like some of them I'll let them go to a huge percentage of the portfolio because the fundamentals keep improving. So there's no like rule of thumb. Um it it's there's a lot of nuance. Do you think Hawaiian Electric can have a similar turnaround to PG&E? We played PG&E. Uh, Hawaiian. I keep looking at it and keep doing nothing. Um, I just don't like Yeah, I I just don't love dead money for so long waiting for government to make a decision. It's kind of a binary gamble and you win, gamble and you lose. Uh, I don't know enough there yet to have confidence, but I think you're on the right trail, but you got to do a lot of work. Thoughts on Polaris PII? This is consumer discretionary. All this is is a wrapped up rate play and I think the time is finally right for that. I think you'll be okay. Uh, Brian Fiserve, longtime listener, huge fan. FI not for me. I just don't see a quick double or or triple in the next few years doing this. I think you'll, you know, probably make some gains, but it's not I'm not clamoring to get shares. I I think you're okay. Uh, I just don't think it's the highest and best use of capital. Uh, let's take a look at Eric Klein. Why not Airbus over Boeing? Um, Airbus doesn't have the same defense business and uh, and there's not enough turnaround in it. So, Boeing has been a monster. If you go back to Vney a few months ago when we were just pounding the table at 135, now it's 214 and it's going higher. So, nothing else to think about. Uh, Johnny S, I also don't like you can't fire people in France. I mean, it's just it's unreal. Uh, looking at Brown Foreman, just want to know why you prefer Dagio over this one. This from Johnny S. Uh, premiumization. Uh, that's the name of the game. Middle class growth. Same story as Estee Lauder. Emerging markets, the whole thing. People drinking less, higher quality, higher margin business. Uh, if I was going to go down your route, then you start to look at, you know, I don't drink much, but when I do, it's a Coors Light. I grew up in Jersey. I'm a simple guy. But I wouldn't buy Molson Kors because it's just a low low margin garbage. Not an ideal great business. So, uh, hard pass. Uh, JD Sports. This is, uh, Jay Gallant. Let's take a look. J D Sports JD.L. margins have come in quite a bit. something. This kind of decline in return on capital looks like uh they probably did a dumb acquisition. L I I just don't like retailers. I know you're telling me here they've got this uh exclusive rights with Nike, yada yada. It it'll probably be okay. I I this is not I I I don't like this type of business even though it probably works as a trade. But thank you for sending in Daniel Borman. Uh, Valaris V A L. Someone is out promoting the hell out of this stock because I get it like every single week. Someone asking me about Valaris. All right. So, it's just turned from negative free cash flow. It's been negative free cash flow for six years. Now, they got like two cents of margins are recovering. So, it looks like it's trying to recover. What do they do for a living here? Dashboard. Offshore drilling. No, I don't like that business. I'm going to I I I would be more inclined if you have to buy something in the services by Slumber or Hallebertton. Since I don't have to, I'm not I've done zero. Um Eric is talking about global liquidity. I'm just looking at global M2 money supply on that front. And then you start to look at rate cuts and uh Fed actions globally. Uh, how's it LVMH reaching levels worth considering? I think we covered LVMH like a month ago and I said it was fine. It's just not for me. I mean, this is a quality compounder. I uh it's just this is the type of business you buy if you have permanent capital. if you have to perform for your owner for your investors on a annual basis uh I think there are higher and better uses of capital but this one will be fine and you'll continue to compound your capital at double digits over time big play on the China recovery we have enough exposure to that with Alibaba but generally a great company and probably at a good price uh Denise there got that already Chris Booker Vic Trex. V I C T R E X. V I C T R E X. Yeah, there's no sign of margin recovery yet. What do these guys do? Okay. Polymer solutions VCT H. This one might be interesting. Polymer solutions. High performance polymer. High performance energy seals. Applications in cars, medical, industrial, electronics. Yeah. Um, take a look at the balance sheet. It's a tiny business. Maybe 2 million four. That's okay. Free cash flow is okay. I just, you know, I think you got to listen to four or eight calls. Like, how are they going to turn around the top line? Um, seems like a pretty stale business that probably has a small little niche. Share counts. Okay. VCT Chris, if you can get confidence that they can turn the top line and uh I do like these business a lot of the chemical related businesses have been left for dead. I I like this area. I think it's going to start to recover. I think it's interesting, but you got to get you got to understand their moat and you got to understand the turnaround plan. And the only way you can do that is doing the work with all the calls. I' I'd listen to the last eight conference calls. What did they say they were going to do? What did they actually do? Are they on track? Are they off track? And kind of take it from there. But I generally think that one is interesting. Uh, okay. So, this guy had sent me Jaz Rube had sent me uh Allegiance. I I don't I don't think I I like this one. Um, ALGT pro it's like a second tier carrier. I mean, it probably trades it's probably a great trade, but I'd almost rather just buy jets. So, yeah, there's they're starting to inflect. Let's see. I I think when you're in such a crappy industry that's beaten down so much, just pick a higher quality name like this. This could work, but if if the recovery gets delayed, this is going to be the one that's hurt the most. So, I don't know. I'd probably be more inclined to take I don't like the space, but I think you're right from a trading perspective. So, kudos to you. Uh, other than that, I think, see, that's a client uh request. We're all set. We'll be back next week, same time, probably a day early. In the meantime, make it a great one. Bye for now. [Music] Heat. Heat. [Music] [Music]
