[00:00:00] Welcome to Hedge Fund Tips with Tom
[00:00:02] Hayes. I'm Tom Hayes and this is your
[00:00:05] 298th videocast podcast for the week
[00:00:08] ending July 3rd, 2025.
[00:00:11] Happy Independence Day for all of you
[00:00:14] celebrating tomorrow. Uh much better
[00:00:17] than happy liberation day. And uh and
[00:00:20] let's move ahead. Uh family first as
[00:00:22] always, then we'll get down to business.
[00:00:23] That's me with Annabelle by the beach
[00:00:25] and Lucky looking confused as usual. Uh,
[00:00:30] moving along. That's Annabelle at her
[00:00:32] birthday party at Great Wolf Lodge
[00:00:34] blowing out the candles. More candles.
[00:00:37] She got four cakes there. There's with
[00:00:39] her friends. That was an awesome day.
[00:00:41] Ah, for those of you who've been
[00:00:42] following along for the last three
[00:00:44] years, I've been playing golf for three
[00:00:45] and a half almost four years now. Uh,
[00:00:47] goal was to get to high singledigit uh
[00:00:51] handicap. I'm now down at low index
[00:00:54] 11.3.
[00:00:56] Uh, so I got 1.3
[00:00:59] strokes to go to hit that goal, which
[00:01:02] means today I'll probably shoot 100
[00:01:04] because the golf gods don't take kindly
[00:01:07] on celebrations. This was out in
[00:01:09] Connecticut. Uh, this is my buddy Blake
[00:01:12] Jason and the pro Drew uh on one of the
[00:01:15] amazing new greens on the back nine.
[00:01:18] Pretty incredible time. Uh th this back
[00:01:21] nine that was redone by Brian Schneider
[00:01:23] who did Old Banyan and Tamarack and
[00:01:26] Garden City and all these great clubs.
[00:01:29] Um f first time out I shot a 47 then 44.
[00:01:33] Third time I shot a 40. So it is doable.
[00:01:36] This just gives you an idea here. I mean
[00:01:38] look at this putt. Unbelievable.
[00:01:41] Um, and then, um, an uh, Mimi is in
[00:01:46] Croatia for water polo camp, which is
[00:01:49] super exciting. She's having a blast.
[00:01:52] Uh, and they're doing some sightseeing
[00:01:54] and all the other fun stuff. She swam
[00:01:57] through that tunnel, kind of led the
[00:01:59] crew through there. She is fearless. Uh,
[00:02:02] then I had the pleasure to join David
[00:02:04] Lynn and his wild and engaged audience.
[00:02:08] Uh you could always see their incredible
[00:02:10] comments on YouTube under the clip. So
[00:02:13] we're going to listen in here. Is your
[00:02:14] review that the Russell will continue
[00:02:16] outperforming uh throughout the second
[00:02:18] half of the year because the 493, the
[00:02:20] unmagnificent 493 will start doing
[00:02:21] better. Is that your view? I think it'll
[00:02:23] not only outperform for the second half
[00:02:24] of the year, I think it'll outperform
[00:02:26] for the second half of the decade. So
[00:02:27] Powell is not the right guy for the job
[00:02:29] right now because he doesn't understand
[00:02:31] history. You're not going to cut your
[00:02:32] way to prosperity. and uh uh cutting
[00:02:35] your way at this point will create a
[00:02:37] slowdown in the economy which is going
[00:02:38] to take more stimulus. So the there's
[00:02:40] only one way out and it's it's going to
[00:02:42] be massive growth and running nominal
[00:02:43] GDP hotter than we have in decades.
[00:02:46] We're speaking now with Thomas Hayes,
[00:02:48] managing member of Great Hill Capital.
[00:02:49] We'll be going over his market outlook.
[00:02:51] Uh Thomas has been on my show several
[00:02:53] times. He's been one of the more
[00:02:54] accurate guests in his predictions. So
[00:02:56] let's see what he has in store for us
[00:02:57] today. Welcome back to the show, Thomas.
[00:02:58] Good to see you. Uh great to see you as
[00:03:00] well. Thanks for having me back, David.
[00:03:02] Tom, let's start by taking a look at
[00:03:03] what's happening today. Uh, let's take a
[00:03:05] look at the budget bill that's being
[00:03:06] voted on right now as we speak on the
[00:03:07] 2nd of July. Trump's budget bill is
[00:03:09] close to becoming law. This is from the
[00:03:11] BBC. Trump's massive tax and spending
[00:03:13] budget bill is returned to the US House
[00:03:14] of Representatives as the clock ticks
[00:03:16] down at the president's 4th of July
[00:03:18] deadline for lawmakers to present him
[00:03:20] with a final version that can be signed
[00:03:22] into law. So, it looks like it's
[00:03:24] happening. Uh, the bill nearly clear
[00:03:26] their clear the Senate or upper chamber
[00:03:28] of Congress on Tuesday. uh VP JD Vance
[00:03:31] cast a tiebreaking vote for more than
[00:03:33] after more than 24 hours of debate and
[00:03:35] resistance from some Republican
[00:03:37] senators. Um let's take a look at what
[00:03:40] this tax bill, this big beautiful bill,
[00:03:43] uh means for not just Americans but also
[00:03:45] investors. Now uh Trump has vowed to cut
[00:03:49] spending. I don't know if he's just
[00:03:51] going 180 on that or if this is a part
[00:03:52] of a bigger plan. I'll let you evaluate
[00:03:55] it. Yeah, look, it it's a negotiation
[00:03:58] and politicians number one job is to get
[00:04:00] reelected. Uh, and the way they get
[00:04:02] reelected, the Congress people and the
[00:04:04] senators, is to bring home the bacon.
[00:04:06] So, uh, he can't get what he wants with
[00:04:08] help out helping other people get what
[00:04:10] they want. I think at this point with
[00:04:12] debt to GDP 120%, you're not going to
[00:04:15] cut your way to prosperity and uh,
[00:04:18] cutting your way at this point will
[00:04:20] create a slowdown in the economy, which
[00:04:22] is going to take more stimulus. So the
[00:04:23] there's only one way out and it's it's
[00:04:25] going to be massive growth and running
[00:04:26] nominal GDP hotter than we have in
[00:04:28] decades. And this bill is a foundation
[00:04:31] of doing so. This coupled with
[00:04:33] deregulation if you look and it's the
[00:04:36] way we did it in the in the ' 50s. So we
[00:04:38] we had 128% debt to GDP following World
[00:04:41] War II. We borrowed a ton of money to
[00:04:43] fight a visible enemy here in the sense
[00:04:46] of COVID. We borrowed a bunch of money
[00:04:47] to fight an invisible enemy. And then we
[00:04:49] kept borrowing more and more even after
[00:04:51] the uh enemy was vanquished. But we are
[00:04:54] where we are. And the only play way to
[00:04:56] way to fix it and bring debt to GDP
[00:04:58] levels down, cut them in half like we
[00:05:00] did in the ' 50s is running growth above
[00:05:03] trend. And by the way, we ran inflation
[00:05:05] above trend in the 50s. So Powell is not
[00:05:08] the right guy for the job right now
[00:05:09] because he doesn't understand history.
[00:05:11] uh inflation is going to have to run
[00:05:13] around 3% for us to have nominal growth
[00:05:16] four 5% and get debt to GDP down to 60%.
[00:05:20] Uh this bill sets that stage with or
[00:05:23] without Powell. Uh you've got the
[00:05:25] mortgageund uh $1 million mortgage
[00:05:27] interest deduction, which is a good
[00:05:29] thing for housing. You got the $5,000
[00:05:31] credit. I'll tell you, I think what's
[00:05:33] interesting, no tax on tips. He promised
[00:05:35] that in his campaign. That's fine. But
[00:05:37] the $10,000
[00:05:40] interest deduction on auto loans for new
[00:05:44] cars built in America, I think is a big
[00:05:47] deal because you haven't seen the auto
[00:05:50] volumes recover to precoid levels like
[00:05:54] you do every cycle for the last 50
[00:05:56] years. Uh and this is going to
[00:06:00] accelerate that. The the reason that's
[00:06:02] important that creates a lot of
[00:06:04] high-paying manufacturing jobs in the US
[00:06:06] and and all the ancillary benefits the
[00:06:08] average car on the road is 13.5 years.
[00:06:11] So not only are the uh OEMs like Ford,
[00:06:14] GM, etc. going to going to start to
[00:06:16] flourish from something like this, but
[00:06:18] all the auto parts suppliers which have
[00:06:20] been kind of left for dead uh because
[00:06:23] the volumes have been anemic are going
[00:06:24] to start to accelerate. That's a lot of
[00:06:26] middle America jobs. And if Trump 2.0 is
[00:06:29] anything like Trump 1.0, you know, the
[00:06:31] real beneficiaries of his policies are
[00:06:33] everyday working people. Real wages rose
[00:06:37] dramatically in his first term. Uh, and
[00:06:39] I think we're going to see more of that
[00:06:40] uh in the second term. Then you take the
[00:06:42] baby investment accounts at $1,000 a
[00:06:45] pop. If you have a baby between 2024 and
[00:06:48] 2028,000 bucks goes into a IRA type of
[00:06:52] uh instrument so that uh new babies can
[00:06:58] participate in the American dream. They
[00:07:00] wake up at 20 years old, 30 years old,
[00:07:02] 35 years old. They've got a down payment
[00:07:04] sitting waiting for them uh for housing
[00:07:07] and family formation. They've got uh
[00:07:09] capital to maybe start a business uh
[00:07:12] further their education, etc. That that
[00:07:14] is a great thing. Uh the headlines are
[00:07:17] all about no one's going to be able to
[00:07:18] use hospitals and uh no one's going to
[00:07:21] get any food stamps. It's it's not quite
[00:07:23] that black and white, but it is a
[00:07:25] trade-off. They are making some cuts to
[00:07:27] places permanently cut the tax cuts and
[00:07:30] jobs act uh uh tax benefits. It's it's
[00:07:34] huge. We'll continue to spur growth. So,
[00:07:36] there's a lot of great stuff here. State
[00:07:39] and local. They they were able to
[00:07:40] negotiate that up to 40,000. So, the
[00:07:42] people on the coasts are happy. Um but
[00:07:46] Hasset uh the net effect Hasset claims
[00:07:49] and believes it's going to add $10,000
[00:07:52] of uh income per household over time.
[00:07:55] and you have that type of money,
[00:07:57] American consumer, you can never bet
[00:07:58] against them. When they have money, they
[00:08:00] spend it. This is um an article
[00:08:02] detailing some of the key items of the
[00:08:03] bill. Let's take a look at some of these
[00:08:05] a look at the key items in Trump's big
[00:08:07] beautiful bill. Social Security taxes,
[00:08:09] uh vow to eliminate taxes on social
[00:08:11] security income, more Medicaid
[00:08:13] requirements, uh changes to Medicaid, uh
[00:08:16] food benefits reforms have been added to
[00:08:18] the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance
[00:08:19] Program, which is used by over 40
[00:08:21] million lowincome Americans. No tax on
[00:08:24] overtime or tips. You've mentioned that.
[00:08:25] Clean energy tax cuts. One of the most
[00:08:27] notable divisions between House and
[00:08:28] Senate Republicans is the Senate's
[00:08:30] proposal for clean energy tax breaks.
[00:08:33] So, what happens next? Uh, which of
[00:08:35] these items or perhaps others stood out
[00:08:38] most to you? Well, look, there's nothing
[00:08:40] good in that article, right? I mean the
[00:08:42] the only thing that uh you know Musk has
[00:08:45] gone apoplelectic about this is because
[00:08:47] all a lot of the the green tax credits
[00:08:50] are getting cut uh and it's subsidized
[00:08:52] uh the business for for many many years
[00:08:55] and he's uh done amazing things because
[00:08:57] of it. Uh but you know 15 years is a
[00:09:01] long runway to continue to subsidize at
[00:09:03] some point if there's validity in in the
[00:09:06] business. It's got to stand on its own
[00:09:07] legs and I think it will. Uh and I think
[00:09:09] it's going to hurt his competitors more
[00:09:11] than it's going to hurt him and he's
[00:09:13] going to be the leader in EVs. So um so
[00:09:16] so that's part of the give and take uh
[00:09:18] as far as the cuts go as far as the the
[00:09:20] puts and takes. I've covered the
[00:09:21] benefits, you've covered the costs. Uh
[00:09:23] but net net it it fosters growth.
[00:09:27] How stimulative is this bill? In other
[00:09:29] words, is this the fiscal impulse that
[00:09:32] we need uh for uh for basically a return
[00:09:37] to uh nominal highs in GDP growth? Uh
[00:09:43] yes. Uh I I actually co-hosted a show uh
[00:09:48] and interviewed this economist who put
[00:09:50] out a report that addressed this
[00:09:52] specific issue. He says in its current
[00:09:54] form and he was kind of you know
[00:09:56] generally bearish. He said it will add
[00:09:58] 40 basis points to GDP as it currently
[00:10:00] stands. I think it's underestimating the
[00:10:03] multiplier effect of these things
[00:10:05] actually uh winding up in the economy.
[00:10:07] You know for one thing if you look at
[00:10:08] the the mistakes that Powell has made
[00:10:10] holding back the housing recovery.
[00:10:12] That's 16.2%
[00:10:14] of GDP is housing. You know 72 million
[00:10:18] millennials can't get their family
[00:10:19] started. the average housing uh starter
[00:10:22] home purchase is is now pushed back into
[00:10:24] the late30s. That's awfully late to have
[00:10:26] kids and start a family and it's because
[00:10:29] of this uh unnecessary 200 basis points
[00:10:32] of restriction by Powell. So if he
[00:10:34] doesn't cut in July, the the the
[00:10:36] solution is very simple. Uh Trump is
[00:10:38] going to announce some dovish person as
[00:10:41] his successor and the market's going to
[00:10:44] immediately discount 200 basis points of
[00:10:46] cuts. Powell will be sitting a lame
[00:10:48] duck. he's welcome to sit in his chair
[00:10:50] for another year, but he will have zero
[00:10:52] power, zero influence, and zero effect.
[00:10:55] Um, alternatively, he can take the right
[00:10:57] action and move to the data dependence
[00:10:59] business, which is the mandate of the
[00:11:01] Fed, uh, uh, versus the prediction
[00:11:04] dependent business, which now he thinks
[00:11:05] he's a forecaster. But if he looks as at
[00:11:08] his own forecast in the summary of
[00:11:09] economic projections, he acknowledges
[00:11:11] that it's a temporary bump. And and if
[00:11:13] that's the case, he should have already
[00:11:15] been cutting. He also acknowledges uh or
[00:11:18] if he believes his own predictions, he
[00:11:19] should look at the his prediction for
[00:11:22] real GDP at 1.4%. If he actually
[00:11:25] believes his own predictions, he should
[00:11:26] have cut 50 basis points in June. Well,
[00:11:29] uh the Powell um press conference, well
[00:11:32] the FOMC press conference rather last uh
[00:11:34] last time was quite dramatic to me at
[00:11:37] least listening to uh the FOM FOMC press
[00:11:41] conference uh because Powell directly
[00:11:43] stated that uh he sees inflationary
[00:11:46] pressures coming and I think that was
[00:11:49] you know as clear and direct as you can
[00:11:52] get from the Fed chairman. I I don't
[00:11:54] know if you agree with that. Well,
[00:11:56] listen, he he he he also believed that
[00:11:59] quantitative easing should be on
[00:12:01] autopilot in December of 2018 and
[00:12:04] crashed the market 20% in 3 weeks before
[00:12:06] Christmas until Minutian called all the
[00:12:08] banks on a Sunday night and bailed them
[00:12:10] out. He also believed that inflation was
[00:12:12] transitory when we know it wasn't and
[00:12:14] and uh was behind the curve. So, it's
[00:12:17] too late. Powell, look, the guy's a
[00:12:18] great business person. I hear he's a
[00:12:20] great golfer. He plays over at
[00:12:22] Congressional. He probably would have
[00:12:23] been a great Treasury Secretary, but he
[00:12:25] has no feel. He's in the wrong position
[00:12:27] and he's being rigid because he read a
[00:12:29] book about Arthur Burns in the 70s. The
[00:12:31] conditions, economic conditions, the
[00:12:33] demographic conditions are nothing like
[00:12:35] they were in the 70s. And rather than
[00:12:38] holding tight to quote unquote preserve
[00:12:40] his legacy, he's got an opportunity to
[00:12:42] go out like Seinfeld, cut rates, stop
[00:12:45] screwing 72 million millennials, stop
[00:12:47] screwing 300 million taxpayers who are
[00:12:49] spending $600 billion on interest that
[00:12:52] they don't need to on interest. That's
[00:12:54] just the the the interest on US debt,
[00:12:57] not to mention their interest pays
[00:12:59] payments in their everyday life, whether
[00:13:01] it's auto loans, uh uh student loans, uh
[00:13:04] trying to uh refinance a house, to buy a
[00:13:08] house, etc. Uh all of that is a huge
[00:13:10] governor and restriction on the economy
[00:13:12] that doesn't need to happen. We if we're
[00:13:14] going to grow our way out and get get
[00:13:16] things in balance, debt to GDP,
[00:13:18] inflation's got to be higher, not lower.
[00:13:20] It's got to be three three and a half.
[00:13:21] And we got to inflate some of the debt
[00:13:23] away. And we've got to have growth above
[00:13:25] that level uh in order for the formula
[00:13:27] to work. Otherwise, you cut and you slow
[00:13:29] things down and you have this 200 basis
[00:13:32] points of restriction, 200 basis points
[00:13:35] Fed funds rate above the rate of
[00:13:36] inflation. Uh and all that's going to
[00:13:39] happen is you're going to increase debt
[00:13:42] to GDP because you can't get growth
[00:13:44] levels at the levels you need them to
[00:13:46] bring that ratio down like we have in
[00:13:48] the past. and and he just is unwilling
[00:13:51] to see it or he's uh uh you know has
[00:13:54] other reasons for for being belligerent,
[00:13:57] but it's it's hurting 300 million people
[00:14:00] e even if it's only intended to hurt one
[00:14:02] person. It's hurting more than 300
[00:14:04] million people in a in a meaningful way.
[00:14:07] Well, it does beg the question as to
[00:14:09] what the Fed is looking at in terms of
[00:14:11] data because headline CPI came in a
[00:14:15] little bit lower than the previous month
[00:14:17] on on an annualized basis, but they are
[00:14:20] that the Fed is projecting uh higher
[00:14:22] inflation or they're, you know, afraid
[00:14:24] of uh inflation not being uh reflected
[00:14:27] in the CPI as of yet. So, I wonder if
[00:14:30] they're looking at other uh coins and
[00:14:32] indicators that are more timely or
[00:14:34] real-time data that may point to a rise
[00:14:36] in inflation or just, you know, consumer
[00:14:38] feedback, something. It's a great
[00:14:41] question because uh it it you you you
[00:14:45] tend to get different outcomes when you
[00:14:47] actually burden yourself with the facts.
[00:14:49] Like, why aren't they talking to Andrew
[00:14:50] Jasse who was on CNBC yesterday saying,
[00:14:53] "We're just not seeing it." I mean, if
[00:14:55] if anyone's going to see it ahead of
[00:14:57] time, it's going to be Amazon and the
[00:14:59] fact that he's out there and they're
[00:15:00] ignoring the real data on the ground.
[00:15:02] And and by the way, I mean, let's say
[00:15:05] they're right, okay? I'm willing to be
[00:15:08] wrong. I'm humble enough to say maybe
[00:15:09] they're right. Maybe it's going to go
[00:15:10] up. What if they cut 100 basis points
[00:15:14] and they're wrong? What's so complicated
[00:15:17] about raising 25 basis points a couple
[00:15:19] times? It's much easier to quell
[00:15:22] inflation than it is to get yourself out
[00:15:25] of deflation. Deflation takes billions
[00:15:27] of dollars of stimulus packages, massive
[00:15:30] unemployment, huge amounts of pain in
[00:15:32] the economy, years of wasted uh
[00:15:35] underproductivity. Uh whereas if you if
[00:15:38] you run a little too hot, you can you
[00:15:40] can curb that pretty darn quickly. Uh
[00:15:43] and and there's no reason for them to
[00:15:45] not have that flexible thinking versus
[00:15:47] I'm going to be right. inflation is
[00:15:49] going to go up. I predict it with my
[00:15:52] crystal ball. Well, all of his
[00:15:53] predictions have been wrong so far. So
[00:15:54] maybe this time he flips the coin and
[00:15:56] he's right, but the mandate is for them
[00:15:59] to be data dependent. And right now
[00:16:00] they're explicitly being prediction
[00:16:02] dependent. For what reason? I I have no
[00:16:04] idea. I can only speculate, but it's uh
[00:16:07] it's hurting a lot more people than the
[00:16:09] one person it's intended to. All right.
[00:16:11] So the we've talked about so far fiscal
[00:16:13] and monetary policy. So the fiscal side
[00:16:15] being the big beautiful bill and the
[00:16:16] monetary side being the um Fed action or
[00:16:19] lack of action shall we say. Uh so what
[00:16:22] does this mean for an investor? Uh how
[00:16:24] do these two um fiscal and uh monetary
[00:16:28] forces play into bond yields first and
[00:16:30] foremost and ultimately um uh stocks and
[00:16:34] and and fixed income? Well, the the the
[00:16:37] beauty of bond yields right now is the
[00:16:38] the the one thing that matters more than
[00:16:40] anything is the 10-year yield because
[00:16:42] that's what mortgages mortgage rates are
[00:16:44] tied to. And Bessant is going to solve
[00:16:46] for that. Uh and probably a shadow Fed
[00:16:49] appointment at after the July meeting if
[00:16:51] they haven't take action is going to
[00:16:53] solve for that. But what Besson's going
[00:16:54] to do and is already done, you saw in
[00:16:56] the last week or so, uh they put out the
[00:16:59] changes for the SLR, the bank capital
[00:17:03] requirements, holding having to hold
[00:17:05] less capital against treasuries, which
[00:17:07] will create more demand for uh US
[00:17:09] treasuries at the banks, which will spur
[00:17:11] more lending. uh the Treasury then then
[00:17:14] can uh issue at the short end of the
[00:17:16] curve and then buy in the longer end of
[00:17:19] the curve like they did in 2012 an
[00:17:21] operation type twist to hold down the
[00:17:23] 10-year yield. Uh and I think on that
[00:17:26] basis and they've they've anticipated 30
[00:17:28] to 70 basis points reduction in the
[00:17:32] 10-year yield once that's implemented
[00:17:34] that should be implemented sometime late
[00:17:36] this summer. uh that would bring the
[00:17:38] 10-year yield down to 350, 370, which is
[00:17:42] going to bring 30-year mortgage rates
[00:17:44] down below six. I think when you see
[00:17:46] that, you're going to see unlimited
[00:17:49] demand for housing. And that's a theme
[00:17:51] that we've positioned ourselves for, not
[00:17:53] with the home builders because there'll
[00:17:55] be a race to bottom in margins, but with
[00:17:58] the arms dealers, the building
[00:18:00] suppliers, uh the QXOs of the world,
[00:18:03] which has been a big winner for us.
[00:18:04] That's Brad Jacobs, uh Beacon Roofing.
[00:18:06] he bought now he's doing a couple more
[00:18:08] tuckins. Uh the Stanley Black & Deckers
[00:18:11] of the world, the Generax of the world,
[00:18:13] etc. are ancillary ways to play that
[00:18:16] recovery. Uh timelinewise, when do you
[00:18:19] think this will happen? Next 3 months.
[00:18:22] Well, how you in terms of the socks or
[00:18:24] in terms of of the implementation of the
[00:18:27] uh amendments to the SLR and bank
[00:18:29] capital requirements? The implement the
[00:18:31] implementation of the amendments. Yeah,
[00:18:33] within the next two to three months.
[00:18:35] Okay. Okay. Do you think markets are
[00:18:36] going to preempt that or react to it
[00:18:38] afterward? Well, I think there's an
[00:18:40] element of that because if you consider
[00:18:42] the perception of the big beautiful bill
[00:18:45] is um
[00:18:48] financial irresponsibility that that's
[00:18:50] the way it's being packaged right now.
[00:18:52] That's the way it's being sold uh in the
[00:18:54] media. And yet 10-year yield has has
[00:18:57] been relatively contained around 425. I
[00:19:00] think there's a there's an offset uh
[00:19:03] what would just be a discreet reaction
[00:19:06] to the big beautiful bill is being
[00:19:08] offset by expectations of what Bessant
[00:19:11] and and Bowman and uh etc are going to
[00:19:14] be implementing on the bank capital
[00:19:17] requirement side. And I think that once
[00:19:20] the bill is passed and we get closer to
[00:19:23] implementation and it becomes real and
[00:19:25] people can understand what the increased
[00:19:27] demand of treasuries both from this and
[00:19:29] from the Genius Act with stable coins uh
[00:19:31] is going to be on on US treasuries, I
[00:19:33] think we're going to be surprised that
[00:19:35] everyone who is calling for 5% when the
[00:19:38] 10-year yield was at 480 is going to be
[00:19:40] shocked that it's uh moving to three and
[00:19:42] a half. And and that's usually what
[00:19:44] happens when everyone gets crowded to
[00:19:45] one side of the boat. All right, let's
[00:19:46] take a look at some of the commentary
[00:19:47] you've posted recently. This is uh hedge
[00:19:49] fund tips, which I encourage everyone to
[00:19:51] check out. Time for a makeover stock
[00:19:53] market and sentiment results. This was
[00:19:55] posted uh last week, I think. And um
[00:19:59] underneath are various video clips of
[00:20:00] you talking about your market outlooks
[00:20:02] and your picks. uh give us a summary of
[00:20:04] how sentiment is um behaving now with uh
[00:20:08] with uh with surveys uh with and other
[00:20:11] data that you're looking at and whether
[00:20:12] or not um sentiment um is an indicator
[00:20:15] of of any buying or selling action that
[00:20:18] investors should be taking a look at.
[00:20:20] Yeah, I think that's great. Thank you uh
[00:20:23] for for doing that. Uh so the first
[00:20:26] thing I would say is that as we know
[00:20:28] David, sentiment got completely washed
[00:20:30] out on April 7th. Okay. on the basis of
[00:20:33] tariff fears um and you saw a trillion
[00:20:37] dollars of sales from CTAs etc at the
[00:20:41] exact wrong time. Bank of America put
[00:20:43] out their fund manager survey of 222
[00:20:46] managers with a half a trillion under
[00:20:48] management about a week and a half ago.
[00:20:50] I was shocked. While sentiment has
[00:20:53] started to recover, as of a week and a
[00:20:56] half ago, it's still similar or in the
[00:20:59] range of levels not seen since the COVID
[00:21:02] lows and the great financial crisis
[00:21:04] lows. I mean, you can't make this up.
[00:21:05] And the market was like 1 and a half%
[00:21:07] off of all-time highs a week and a half
[00:21:10] ago. And managers are still underweight,
[00:21:13] uh, non-believing, pessimistic. Most of
[00:21:16] them had been waiting for a retest of
[00:21:17] the lows. And now they are being forced
[00:21:21] buyers. Okay, so the shorts have had to
[00:21:23] cover. They were the first buyers. Now
[00:21:25] the institutional managers that sold in
[00:21:27] the hole are being forced in on every
[00:21:29] positive headline, whether it's a deal
[00:21:31] today with Vietnam or, you know,
[00:21:33] Japanese not taking our rice, now taking
[00:21:35] our rice. I mean, you can't make this
[00:21:37] stuff up. Or the Canadians dropping the
[00:21:39] digital uh services tax and coming back
[00:21:42] to the table. Every new headline is
[00:21:44] going to force more money into the
[00:21:45] market, and there's still a lot on on
[00:21:47] the sidelines. Then you take global M2
[00:21:49] money supply is now at a record. It had
[00:21:52] been basically flatlining since 2022. So
[00:21:54] you got liquidity in the market. People
[00:21:57] off sides on positioning have to chase
[00:21:59] up to keep their jobs to catch the
[00:22:00] indices. When you're behind behind the
[00:22:03] mark on performance and the indices are
[00:22:05] ahead of you. What do you do? You buy
[00:22:07] the catch-up trade. You buy the lagards
[00:22:09] which is why the I think the second half
[00:22:11] is going to be dominated by the 493
[00:22:13] versus the seven mag seven rather. Uh
[00:22:17] and then expectations are still pretty
[00:22:19] low. You know, you're going into
[00:22:20] earnings season. They cut expectations
[00:22:22] from 9.4%
[00:22:23] earnings growth on March uh 31st for Q2.
[00:22:27] It's now down to 5%. So that sets the
[00:22:30] stage for earnings to beat expectations.
[00:22:32] We'll see what guidance looks like. But
[00:22:34] but you're seeing seuite CEO CFO uh
[00:22:38] confidence coming back, animal spirits
[00:22:40] coming back, deals coming back,
[00:22:42] investment coming back. So, my
[00:22:44] expectation is guidance is going to be a
[00:22:46] little bit better, barring some, you
[00:22:48] know, crazy town stuff between now and
[00:22:50] the 9th, which we'll get a taste of, I'm
[00:22:51] sure. Uh, but I think we're going to get
[00:22:53] more deals announced than we're going to
[00:22:55] get crazy town. And, uh, and with that
[00:22:57] said, it forces more money in. This is
[00:22:59] that time of year. I think I start to
[00:23:01] get a little nervous if we push a, you
[00:23:03] know, meaningfully higher in July. uh
[00:23:06] probably start to take a few chips on
[00:23:08] the table heading into uh into the fall
[00:23:11] just just for normal volatility and and
[00:23:13] for those things that have reached full
[00:23:14] intrinsic value at that time. Let's
[00:23:16] drill a little bit deeper into your
[00:23:17] thesis of why the 493 could outperform
[00:23:19] the Mag 7, the unmagnificent 493 versus
[00:23:22] the Magnificent 7. Is this a valuation
[00:23:24] story? Is this a uh an operating margin
[00:23:27] story? Is this just sentiment shifting?
[00:23:29] What is it? uh it's a combination of all
[00:23:31] but the number number one thing that uh
[00:23:34] determines uh the valuation of business
[00:23:36] is in the short term it's in it's a the
[00:23:39] market is a voting machine based on
[00:23:40] emotion in the long intermediate and
[00:23:42] long term it's a weighing machine based
[00:23:44] on fundamentals and if you look at the
[00:23:46] simple fundamentals of the mag 7 uh
[00:23:48] earnings growth in the first quarter of
[00:23:50] this last year was over 30% first
[00:23:52] quarter of this year was 27% that's
[00:23:54] going to decelerate down to 10.2% 2% in
[00:23:59] the first quarter of 2026. At the same
[00:24:02] time, the 493 collectively had negative
[00:24:06] earnings growth towards the end end of
[00:24:07] last year and first quarter of this
[00:24:09] year. That is now going to accelerate to
[00:24:12] 10.3%
[00:24:14] earnings growth by Q1 of 2026. So,
[00:24:18] effectively with the MAG 7, you've got
[00:24:21] collapsing earnings growth because of
[00:24:23] all the capex uh that they're putting
[00:24:25] in. And most people say it's offensive
[00:24:27] spending. I would say it's defensive
[00:24:28] spending because we don't know the
[00:24:30] return on investment as of now. Uh it'll
[00:24:32] probably be substantial, but but it's to
[00:24:35] be determined. Uh and uh and the
[00:24:38] unmagnificent 493 is accelerating
[00:24:41] earnings growth. The problem with the
[00:24:42] MAG 7 is the multiples have not come
[00:24:45] down relative to the earnings growth
[00:24:47] deceleration, and that's a divergence
[00:24:49] that will play catch-up. uh whereas the
[00:24:52] unmagnificent 493 you can get more
[00:24:54] earnings growth if you look a couple
[00:24:56] quarters out for uh basically half the
[00:25:00] multiple uh and and I think all these
[00:25:02] managers that c got caught behind the
[00:25:04] eightball in early April are going to
[00:25:06] have to play the lagger trade. So what
[00:25:09] does that mean in terms of the indices?
[00:25:10] The indicy returns could be more subdued
[00:25:13] in the second half than people are
[00:25:14] expecting in that in the current state
[00:25:17] of euphoria right now. uh they'll be
[00:25:19] good. But if you consider that you know
[00:25:22] 30 40% of the weight of that index has
[00:25:26] meaningfully declining earnings growth
[00:25:28] rates uh the fortunes are going to be
[00:25:30] made or the big money is going to be
[00:25:32] made in the other 493 which will have
[00:25:35] less of an impact on the index
[00:25:38] appreciation and more of an impact on
[00:25:41] your portfolio appreciation. I mean, I
[00:25:43] could see some active managers up 50 75%
[00:25:47] in the next 9 to 12 months with uh the
[00:25:50] indices up maybe, you know, another 9 to
[00:25:53] 11%. You know, something in that range.
[00:25:56] Uh and people wonder why uh you know
[00:25:59] some stocks feel like they're grinding
[00:26:01] sideways and doing not much which is
[00:26:03] because their earnings growth is
[00:26:05] decelerating and others are doubling and
[00:26:07] tripling because they're playing
[00:26:08] catch-up uh postco and and finally
[00:26:11] getting back to normalized free cash
[00:26:13] flow levels. So Tom, let's talk about
[00:26:16] the consumer. I'm curious to see how you
[00:26:18] think the consumer is going to spend uh
[00:26:20] his or her money later on in the year
[00:26:21] and whether or not these spending
[00:26:22] patterns may impact certain industries
[00:26:24] more than others. I'll give you a few
[00:26:25] stats uh first to jump off of. So um as
[00:26:28] of the latest PCE data we have here
[00:26:31] after a decrease in spending overall by
[00:26:33] $29 billion in May. Uh good spending
[00:26:35] fell $49 billion. Services spending rose
[00:26:39] $19.9 billion. Real PCE inflation
[00:26:42] adjusted declined by 0.3%.
[00:26:45] That's PCE spending. Uh other key uh
[00:26:48] retail uh consumer data, credit card
[00:26:51] spending per household rose by 0.8%.
[00:26:54] year-over-year in May. Uh delinquency
[00:26:56] rates and charge offs have been eased
[00:26:58] slightly. Um 2025 June retail sales data
[00:27:02] showed uh continued resilience in
[00:27:04] spending. Uh weak consumer sentiment,
[00:27:06] however, uh still lingers in a 0.3%
[00:27:09] month-over-month decline in real percent
[00:27:11] real PC, which is what I just mentioned.
[00:27:13] So, um bit of a mixed bag here. Spending
[00:27:16] less overall, but credit card spending
[00:27:18] is up. Uh delinquencies have been
[00:27:20] written off slightly. So I think people
[00:27:22] are spending more on their credit cards
[00:27:23] but spending less overall.
[00:27:26] So what does this mean for you? Well,
[00:27:28] let's let's parse that because what you
[00:27:31] said was goods spending decelerated. And
[00:27:34] the reason that goods spending
[00:27:36] decelerated is because there was a
[00:27:39] monstrous pull forward prior to tariffs
[00:27:42] in March. Okay, both with autos, both
[00:27:46] with retail goods, both with everything
[00:27:48] under the sun. So goods got a huge pull
[00:27:52] forward and we saw it in the numbers
[00:27:53] prior to uh what did he call that uh
[00:27:56] independence day or what what was it was
[00:27:58] it was it called independation day
[00:27:59] liberation day. Liberation day.
[00:28:01] Independence Day is coming up. Uh
[00:28:03] liberation day prior to liberation day.
[00:28:05] So so that's what happened. But now
[00:28:07] you're seeing services spending up. So
[00:28:09] they got all the goods that they're
[00:28:10] going to need ahead of the tariffs. So
[00:28:12] now they've got this money that where
[00:28:14] are they spending it? They're spending
[00:28:15] it in services. Services are actually
[00:28:16] going up. Second thing you need to keep
[00:28:18] in mind is that in April uh sentiment
[00:28:23] got completely flushed with with the
[00:28:25] tariffs. So not only did they buy all
[00:28:27] their stuff up front, but then they were
[00:28:28] scared because their 401ks were down for
[00:28:31] a few weeks. So naturally spending went
[00:28:34] down. What you have seen in May and June
[00:28:37] is a rebound uh both in umish and in uh
[00:28:41] CB confidence uh a rebound in sentiment
[00:28:46] now that there seems to be some
[00:28:48] rationality around tariff policy uh and
[00:28:52] uh and that has been reflected in the
[00:28:54] rebound in services spending but the
[00:28:56] goods they got to work through all the
[00:28:58] toilet paper that they bought in March
[00:29:00] uh that everyone was afraid was going to
[00:29:02] be a crazy town. So, I think that
[00:29:04] there's some of these that are a little
[00:29:06] short-term misleading because of the
[00:29:08] lagged effect of anticipation of
[00:29:10] Liberation Day and then the lagged
[00:29:12] effect of the uh unfear and uncertainty
[00:29:16] created during the month of March and
[00:29:18] and certainly April uh and now the slow
[00:29:20] recovery of both. But I did find that
[00:29:24] stat interesting that the credit card
[00:29:26] defaults have decelerated. Um, which uh
[00:29:30] which was also a little bit uh a little
[00:29:32] bit surprising and I I think that's a
[00:29:34] function of what we're starting to see
[00:29:37] the taste of now that we're through the
[00:29:40] chaos of the first few months. Uh is
[00:29:43] real wages rising at the lower end. So,
[00:29:45] I I think that's going to be a positive
[00:29:47] trend and a theme for the next three and
[00:29:49] a half years is uh less um you know,
[00:29:53] Wall Street will do fine, but in in the
[00:29:55] first term of Trump, it wasn't a Wall
[00:29:58] Street term. It was a Main Street term.
[00:30:00] Main Street did on a relative Wall
[00:30:02] Street did fine. Main Street did much
[00:30:05] better on a relative basis in terms of
[00:30:08] percentage gains from where they were at
[00:30:10] baseline than Wall Street did. And I
[00:30:13] think the same is going to be true uh
[00:30:15] for the next three and a half years. I
[00:30:16] think regular Americans are going to do
[00:30:18] exceptionally well starting with this
[00:30:20] big beautiful bill and some of the
[00:30:22] deregulation policies that are to come,
[00:30:24] the capital requirements, opening up the
[00:30:26] lending, the credit spots. I mean the
[00:30:29] game is literally just getting started.
[00:30:32] If mainstream is going to do mainstream
[00:30:35] is going to do better in the uh in the
[00:30:38] foreseeable future, does that mean a
[00:30:39] shift towards discretionary plays uh
[00:30:42] should be the um uh should be the focus
[00:30:45] for investors? Yeah, I absolutely think
[00:30:47] that's right. Um and I do think a lot of
[00:30:50] the discretionary stocks have have kind
[00:30:52] of been left for dead. uh you see some
[00:30:55] of these turnarounds starting to get a
[00:30:56] little bit of uh uh a glimmer of hope
[00:30:59] whether it's Nike, whether it's VF Corp.
[00:31:03] Uh some of that's China related that
[00:31:05] China is starting to recover as well. Uh
[00:31:07] more and more stimulus, more and more
[00:31:09] consumption focused. Uh but but I do
[00:31:12] like that theme. I think housing is
[00:31:14] going to be a major factor. I think when
[00:31:16] people can trade out, there are a lot of
[00:31:18] boomers trapped with millions of equity
[00:31:20] that don't want to trade down because
[00:31:22] they don't want to trade a 3% mortgage
[00:31:24] for seven, but they will trade a three
[00:31:26] for five and a half if they can pull $2
[00:31:27] million of equity out of their house and
[00:31:29] put that in investing. So, uh I think I
[00:31:32] think you're going to see more of that.
[00:31:33] I do really like that theme going
[00:31:37] forward of of betting on the consumer
[00:31:39] and particularly in those areas uh that
[00:31:42] have been beat down quite a bit
[00:31:43] particularly home building and home home
[00:31:46] building some of the consumer
[00:31:49] discretionary you know Nike is not one
[00:31:51] we own we we would own but we're we're
[00:31:54] going to play the turnaround with Brack
[00:31:55] and Daryl over at VF Corp which is a
[00:31:58] similar type theme we don't want to get
[00:31:59] too much exposure there uh Estee Lauder
[00:32:02] is another one that that had been left
[00:32:04] for dead. This is the number one in
[00:32:07] premium skin care and premium uh
[00:32:10] cosmetics around the world and they got
[00:32:12] smashed because of China primarily. But
[00:32:15] the good news is even though their
[00:32:17] revenues went down um uh they've
[00:32:21] maintained share in all their regions.
[00:32:23] Even in China they maintain 99% of their
[00:32:25] share. So, as the consumer comes back,
[00:32:28] which they will, uh they'll be coming,
[00:32:31] they'll be getting more a larger and
[00:32:33] larger piece of the pie as their smaller
[00:32:35] competitors were hurt more during this
[00:32:38] trough. Uh and and they start to
[00:32:40] recover. I mean, this is a business that
[00:32:41] has been buying and selling brands.
[00:32:43] They've got, you know, a dozen plus
[00:32:45] brands, whether it's Clinique, whether
[00:32:47] it's MAC, whether it's Dr. Chart, the
[00:32:49] Korean skincare that's popular with the
[00:32:51] young kids like my daughters. uh they've
[00:32:54] got something for everyone. Aveda at the
[00:32:56] spas uh and they will buy and sell the
[00:32:59] right brands respectively. It's a family
[00:33:01] controlled business. It's going to be a
[00:33:03] great recovery as the consumer comes
[00:33:05] back not only in China but globally and
[00:33:08] we're seeing more and more of that dayby
[00:33:10] day. This is an interesting uh take on
[00:33:13] uh investing because I'm just trying to
[00:33:15] pull up an article here to show you uh
[00:33:16] for this next question. Uh yeah, here we
[00:33:18] go. Uh luxury good spending is falling
[00:33:20] in the US actually all around the world.
[00:33:22] I'm seeing reports of similar stories
[00:33:24] here. Uh the the wealthy are just
[00:33:26] cutting back on travel, uh business
[00:33:28] class tickets, uh luxury goods spending,
[00:33:32] uh car sales. Um even even in the
[00:33:35] high-end car market and watch market,
[00:33:37] you're seeing prices fall for high-end
[00:33:39] items. Um I don't know if that's a
[00:33:41] signal of anything, whether that that's
[00:33:42] a is that a lagging indicator or a
[00:33:45] leading indicator. It's 100% lagging.
[00:33:46] I'm looking at your article as we speak.
[00:33:48] It said uh 6.8% 8% decline in April,
[00:33:52] 8.5% decline in March. Well, those were
[00:33:54] the people that were hit the most
[00:33:55] because they they they live off of
[00:33:57] assets and and their assets were down 20
[00:33:59] 25% for a few weeks. Of course, uh they
[00:34:03] pulled back and they'll be the first
[00:34:04] ones to recover as consumer sentiment
[00:34:06] comes back. And you know, if you go to
[00:34:08] any decent restaurant, good luck getting
[00:34:10] a reservation. I mean, I'm in Orange
[00:34:12] County here and like uh on a Tuesday
[00:34:15] night, I had trouble getting a
[00:34:16] reservation at a decent restaurant to to
[00:34:18] go out with a few friends. So, uh, so it
[00:34:21] is what it is. I mean, they're just as
[00:34:23] quickly as they fell on the uncertainty
[00:34:25] for 2 weeks and, uh, as long as they
[00:34:28] didn't puke in the hole like all the
[00:34:29] CTAs and institutional investors, uh,
[00:34:32] they they're doing just fine and they've
[00:34:34] recovered more than what they lost.
[00:34:36] Let's finish off in your overall market
[00:34:38] sentiment or outlook rather. So, this is
[00:34:40] the S&P versus the Russell. Again,
[00:34:41] outperformance by the big caps versus
[00:34:43] the Russell 2000 on a year-to- date
[00:34:45] basis, one-year basis, 6 month and 3
[00:34:47] months, any time frame that you want to
[00:34:49] put it. Um, except the last month when
[00:34:51] the Russell started outperforming. Um,
[00:34:53] is your view that the Russell will
[00:34:54] continue outperforming uh throughout the
[00:34:56] second half of the year because the 493,
[00:34:58] the unmnificent 493 will start doing
[00:35:00] better. Is that your view? I think it'll
[00:35:02] not only outperform for the second half
[00:35:04] of the year, I think it'll outperform
[00:35:05] for the second half of the decade. So uh
[00:35:08] I think this is going to be very similar
[00:35:10] to 2001 to 2006 when uh small caps
[00:35:14] dramatically outperformed value
[00:35:15] outperformed i.e. the unmagnificent 493
[00:35:19] I guess is the way you'd kind of view
[00:35:21] that mostly today. uh international
[00:35:24] outperformed. I think you're going to
[00:35:25] see a continued weaker dollar and on a
[00:35:27] relative basis like you saw in the first
[00:35:29] half of this year international and you
[00:35:31] know I was on your show last year when
[00:35:33] you couldn't give away an international
[00:35:34] stock pounding the table on
[00:35:36] international versus US that's been out
[00:35:38] ma massive outperformance year to date
[00:35:40] that's going to continue for the second
[00:35:42] half of the decade. It's not because the
[00:35:43] US has lost its exceptionalism or any
[00:35:45] nonsense like that. Same thing happened
[00:35:47] the second term of uh Ronald Reagan's
[00:35:50] presidency. It just runs in 10 to 15
[00:35:52] year cycles and we've had this
[00:35:54] aberrational zerp environment which is
[00:35:56] over and uh and and everyone keeps
[00:35:59] looking in the rearview mirror waiting
[00:36:00] for what's happened in the last 10 years
[00:36:02] to continue for the next 10 years and
[00:36:04] that's exactly when it doesn't. So, uh,
[00:36:06] you got a zigg when others are zagging.
[00:36:08] Continue to look at for opportunity in
[00:36:10] the 493. Small and mid versus large. Uh,
[00:36:14] look look for some focus there.
[00:36:16] International versus domestic, continue
[00:36:18] to have focus there if you didn't start
[00:36:20] your year off there. Uh, uh, you you
[00:36:23] want to start to find some exposure to
[00:36:25] international for the next 3 to 5 years.
[00:36:28] And, uh, and and US indices will do just
[00:36:30] fine. They'll just be slightly more
[00:36:32] subdued than than looking in the
[00:36:34] rearview mirror. So, uh, so that's kind
[00:36:36] of our view. That's that's how we're
[00:36:37] positioned. That's our framework. Uh,
[00:36:40] all as always, opinion, not advice, but,
[00:36:42] uh, it's worked exceptionally well for
[00:36:43] us this year, and I think it's going to
[00:36:45] continue to do so, uh, for many years to
[00:36:47] come. And final question, the, uh, the
[00:36:49] S&P 500, this is the first week that the
[00:36:51] S&P has um, uh, retraced and
[00:36:54] outperformed its previous all-time high,
[00:36:56] which was back in uh, February. Yeah,
[00:36:59] midFebruary. So, uh, where's it headed
[00:37:01] from here? Is it too much froth or uh is
[00:37:03] this just the beginning of a new rally?
[00:37:06] No, I I look I think we'll push higher
[00:37:08] here into earnings season probably the
[00:37:10] next few weeks and then I think we got
[00:37:11] to consolidate some gains maybe uh you
[00:37:14] know August, September, October, grind
[00:37:16] sideways, maybe a little natural
[00:37:18] pullbacks etc. and probably finish the
[00:37:20] year a little little stronger. So, uh,
[00:37:22] again, if you're hoping that the indices
[00:37:24] are going to go up another 20% in the
[00:37:26] next 3 months, uh, I'd be looking under
[00:37:29] the surface for real opportunities that
[00:37:31] can double before the end of the year
[00:37:32] because the indices, if you're looking
[00:37:34] for another 20% uh, in the next uh, to
[00:37:38] finish out the year, I don't think
[00:37:39] you're going to get anything close to
[00:37:41] that, but I do think there are there are
[00:37:43] enough companies prime that you can find
[00:37:45] enough doubles that uh, that the indices
[00:37:48] aren't going to matter if you do your
[00:37:49] work. Excellent. Thank you very much.

[00:38:53] And we're back. And then I had the
[00:38:55] pleasure to join BBC News. Um, we're
[00:39:00] going to listen in here. Investors are
[00:39:02] awaiting the next phase of Trump's trade
[00:39:05] war as his 90-day tariff pause on
[00:39:07] several economies expires next week. So
[00:39:10] for more on what's ahead for markets,
[00:39:11] I'm joined by Thomas Hayes, the chairman
[00:39:13] of Great Hill Capital. Thank you for
[00:39:15] joining me, Thomas. Let's start with the
[00:39:16] US market. What's driving these gains?
[00:39:20] Well, Katie, uh, first off, thanks for
[00:39:23] having me. Markets climb a wall of
[00:39:25] worry. We've basically gone from tariffs
[00:39:28] and bombs to tax cuts and growth, and
[00:39:31] the market is focused on the latter, not
[00:39:34] the former. Uh, sentiment, you've got so
[00:39:37] many institutional managers offside. If
[00:39:40] you look at the most recent Bank of
[00:39:42] America Fund Manager survey, sentiment
[00:39:44] is still near COVID low levels and great
[00:39:48] financial crisis low levels. So, every
[00:39:50] bit of good news is going to push the
[00:39:52] markets higher. And finally, we're going
[00:39:54] into earnings season with very low
[00:39:56] expectations of 5% earnings growth.
[00:39:58] That's down from 9.3 just at the end of
[00:40:01] March. So, it sets the stage to force
[00:40:04] all of these managers who sold at the
[00:40:07] lows in early April. It's going to
[00:40:10] continue to force them back in because
[00:40:11] they've simply been off sides. It's
[00:40:14] fascinating that you say there's a lot
[00:40:15] of pessimism in the market, but yet
[00:40:16] we're seeing any sign of optimism
[00:40:19] pushing up the market. How much is uh
[00:40:21] President Trump's big beautiful bill, as
[00:40:23] he's called it? You mentioned that
[00:40:24] fiscal stimulus. How much do you think
[00:40:26] that is uh furthering the market
[00:40:28] forward?
[00:40:30] Yeah, there's no question about it. It's
[00:40:31] it's all about growth and deregulation
[00:40:35] and increasing GDP. The tax cuts are
[00:40:38] good for for companies earnings. Uh
[00:40:41] we're seeing real wages rise again for
[00:40:43] the workingclass people in America. So a
[00:40:46] lot of the policies are really being
[00:40:47] wellreceived by the markets, well
[00:40:50] received by companies. And you know
[00:40:51] what's coming back more than ever is CEO
[00:40:54] and seuite confidence which had been in
[00:40:56] an abysmal level uh in in the first
[00:40:59] quarter and going into April. Now
[00:41:02] they're starting animal spirits are
[00:41:03] coming back. You're seeing deals. You're
[00:41:05] seeing investment. Uh you're seeing
[00:41:08] planning now that they understand better
[00:41:11] the rules of the road going forward and
[00:41:13] they're seeing some flexibility and
[00:41:15] rationality. And then you couple that
[00:41:17] with global liquidity. M2 money supply
[00:41:20] at an all-time high. It had been
[00:41:22] flatlining since uh 2022. And we had 64
[00:41:27] central bank rate cuts last month. Not
[00:41:30] one out of the US, but 64 uh globally
[00:41:33] year to date rather and 15 last month
[00:41:37] alone around the world. Uh again, none
[00:41:39] out of the US. So, we're pretty hopeful
[00:41:41] seeing some of these Fed members come
[00:41:43] out against Powell, whether it's Bowen
[00:41:46] or Goulsby or Waller, indicating that
[00:41:48] maybe earlier if the inflation numbers
[00:41:51] continue to show uh positive signs,
[00:41:53] maybe they go in in June as a surprise,
[00:41:55] but certainly the odds of September have
[00:41:57] gone up for a cut. You mentioned wage
[00:42:01] rises as part of that beautiful bill.
[00:42:03] But of course, we are going to big big
[00:42:05] part of the contentions is the cuts to
[00:42:06] Medicaid. Another interesting element
[00:42:08] there of course is President Trump's
[00:42:10] pledge to uh reduce taxes on uh service
[00:42:14] workers. Thank you for joining me Thomas
[00:42:16] Hayes, chairman of Great Hill Capital.
[00:42:18] And Thomas of course mentioned the Fed.
[00:42:20] We've heard we've also seen Donald Trump
[00:42:22] continuing to extend his attack against
[00:42:24] the Federal Reserve's chair Jerome Pal.
[00:42:28] And we're back uh going on to CNA in
[00:42:32] Singapore, which is the largest station
[00:42:35] uh in Asia. like the BBC of Asia will
[00:42:38] listen in here now for analysis. Let's
[00:42:41] bring in Thomas Hayes, chairman and
[00:42:43] managing member at Great Hill Capital.
[00:42:45] Thomas, uh, thanks for joining us today.
[00:42:47] So, there you go. We've got the bill at
[00:42:50] least passed the Senate. Um, there's a
[00:42:52] lot of market anticipation before this
[00:42:54] on the uh the added debt it would put on
[00:42:59] the US, but at the same time, the
[00:43:01] potential economic boost this could
[00:43:03] bring to the US economy. for you, how do
[00:43:06] you weigh those two factors?
[00:43:10] Yeah. Well, listen, markets climb a wall
[00:43:12] of worry. We've shifted from focus on
[00:43:14] tariffs and bombs to tax cuts, growth,
[00:43:18] and deregulation, and the market likes
[00:43:20] it. If I didn't know any better, from
[00:43:22] listening to the to the previews, I
[00:43:23] would say this is a bad bill. It
[00:43:25] couldn't be further from the truth. You
[00:43:27] know, when you have debt to GDP of 121%,
[00:43:30] 120%. The last thing you can do is cut
[00:43:34] your way to prosperity, the only thing
[00:43:36] you can do is grow your way out of the
[00:43:39] problem like we did in the 1950s. The
[00:43:42] last time we had debt to GDP of 120%,
[00:43:44] within 10 years, we had above trend
[00:43:47] growth through smart policies and we
[00:43:50] brought our debt to GDP down to 63%. The
[00:43:53] same thing's going to happen right now.
[00:43:54] You've got a $10,000
[00:43:57] deduction on interest on new cars.
[00:44:00] That's going to create a lot of
[00:44:02] manufacturing jobs in the auto industry,
[00:44:04] which volumes have been anemic since
[00:44:07] since co. Those are going to skyrocket
[00:44:09] with the average car on the road now
[00:44:11] 13.5 years old. Expect new cars to boom.
[00:44:14] Then you've got this $1,000 account for
[00:44:18] brand new for new babies born between
[00:44:20] 2024 and 2028. They're going to get
[00:44:23] $1,000 in basically like an IRA that's
[00:44:26] going to compound. So by the time
[00:44:27] they're 18 and 30, they're going to have
[00:44:29] a significant nest egg. This is a
[00:44:32] brilliant innovative idea that's going
[00:44:34] to set up our next generation for
[00:44:36] prosperity. You've got the extension of
[00:44:38] the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. Yes, you have
[00:44:41] some cuts in food stamps. Yes, you have
[00:44:44] some cuts in Medicaid, which are not
[00:44:46] ideal, but it's a negotiation and this
[00:44:49] is very constructive. You know, you I
[00:44:51] heard uh the previous speaker talk about
[00:44:53] the markets were kind of muted. If you
[00:44:56] owned anything other than the
[00:44:58] Magnificent 7, the unmagnificent 493
[00:45:01] components of the S&P 500, your
[00:45:04] portfolio was up massively today. And
[00:45:07] the reason is is because it's going to
[00:45:09] create a massive amount of jobs for
[00:45:12] regular working people on Main Street
[00:45:15] and the market like that. If you
[00:45:17] believed that growth was going to slow,
[00:45:19] mag 7 would have been what was up and it
[00:45:22] was just the opposite. This is very
[00:45:24] positive, Sarah. Yes, I hear your
[00:45:27] optimism there, Thomas. But what about
[00:45:29] the massive addition to US government
[00:45:31] debt as well? How much of a concern is
[00:45:34] that for you when you know the US has
[00:45:37] had its ratings knocked down and you can
[00:45:40] see that uncertainty and the uneasiness
[00:45:43] in the bond market? Listen,
[00:45:47] number one, the 10-year yield is at four
[00:45:51] foreign change. So, there's no
[00:45:52] uneasiness in the bond market at
[00:45:53] present. So, that that's a that's a
[00:45:55] nonsequator. Uh, as far as the
[00:45:59] assumptions as it relates to adding to
[00:46:01] the deficit, it's assuming subpar
[00:46:04] growth. That assumption could not be
[00:46:06] further from the truth if you actually
[00:46:08] understand what's in the bill in terms
[00:46:10] of spurring job growth, spurring
[00:46:12] innovation, spurring investment,
[00:46:14] spurring onshoring and domestic
[00:46:17] manufacturing. What you find is the
[00:46:19] assumptions in those projections are
[00:46:21] incorrect uh by an agency that's been
[00:46:24] chronically wrong over the years. So I
[00:46:26] think you have to uh keep an open mind
[00:46:29] that when you have 120% debt to GDP, if
[00:46:33] you don't have growth, you are on a path
[00:46:34] to Japan. The only way to fight that
[00:46:38] situation is to spur massive growth. And
[00:46:40] the policies in this bill are to spur
[00:46:43] massive growth. Then you're going to
[00:46:45] couple that with deregulation in the
[00:46:47] second half. uh uh changing capital
[00:46:49] requirements for banks, allowing them to
[00:46:51] lend more, allowing them to hold
[00:46:53] treasuries, uh allowing uh the the
[00:46:56] stable coins with the Genius Act,
[00:46:57] creating massive demand for US
[00:46:59] treasuries, you're going to see rates
[00:47:01] come down. Uh you're going to see a
[00:47:03] shadow Fed announced by uh by President
[00:47:07] Trump. If Powell doesn't cut in July,
[00:47:10] Trump will announce his pick for Fed and
[00:47:12] the market will start to discount 200
[00:47:14] basis points of cuts and Powell will be
[00:47:17] a lame duck until next May. So given all
[00:47:21] that, Thomas, that you're excited about
[00:47:24] it, will that potential economic growth
[00:47:26] translate to market gains at least for
[00:47:28] the second half of this year?
[00:47:32] What you're going to see is the
[00:47:35] companies that have lagged behind, the
[00:47:37] real economy companies that create jobs
[00:47:40] for middle class are going to boom, but
[00:47:44] they are a lower weight in the S&P 500.
[00:47:47] So, you have 490 some odd companies that
[00:47:50] make up uh 70% of the index and you have
[00:47:53] 7 to 10 companies that make up 30 or 40%
[00:47:56] of the index. So you could see a more
[00:47:59] slightly more subdued return in the
[00:48:01] general indices because MAG 7 will do
[00:48:04] less well on a relative basis due to
[00:48:07] declining earnings growth as a function
[00:48:10] of increased capex while the 493 you
[00:48:13] could have many many companies doubling
[00:48:16] in stock price and the indices may be up
[00:48:19] much more modestly. So the short answer,
[00:48:22] Sarah, is it's a stock pickers market
[00:48:24] and there's going to be uh money made in
[00:48:26] the next 6 months by by quality stock
[00:48:29] pickers that we haven't seen in a long
[00:48:31] long time. Opportunity is here now.
[00:48:37] All right. And Thomas, what is your
[00:48:38] outlook then for the US dollar which has
[00:48:41] weakened so far this year?
[00:48:45] Uh I think the trend is going to be
[00:48:47] lower over the next couple years. I
[00:48:49] think a decent analog is, you know, 2001
[00:48:52] to 2004. It had been overvalued relative
[00:48:56] to fundamentals for some time going into
[00:48:58] this year. Uh we had a view that the
[00:49:02] dollar would weaken and it will continue
[00:49:03] to weaken. You're going to get some
[00:49:05] counter trend bounces as more and more
[00:49:07] people get bearish on the dollar now
[00:49:09] that it's down 10 11%. Uh I think after
[00:49:12] those counter trend bounces, it's going
[00:49:14] to resume the downtrend and I think
[00:49:16] you're going to see continued
[00:49:18] performance. This year it's been massive
[00:49:20] outperformance of international equity
[00:49:22] indices versus US equity indices. I
[00:49:26] think that trend is going to persist for
[00:49:28] some time and most people still are not
[00:49:31] positioned for it. So expect continued
[00:49:33] weakening dollar, expect continued great
[00:49:36] performance from of international
[00:49:38] equities relative to the US and in the
[00:49:41] US those laggered companies, the
[00:49:43] unmagnificent 493 to dramatically
[00:49:46] outperform if you're picking the right
[00:49:48] ones prospectively. So if you're just
[00:49:50] jammed in US indices, you're going to do
[00:49:52] okay, but not great. If you have some
[00:49:55] international exposure and some exposure
[00:49:57] under the surface in US, you're going to
[00:49:59] do exceptionally well in our opinion.
[00:50:02] Okay, we'll watch that space, Thomas.
[00:50:04] Appreciate it. Thomas H there of Grey
[00:50:05] Hill Capital. And those are your
[00:50:07] business updates for this hour. For
[00:50:08] more, keep up across all of our CNA.
[00:50:12] And we're back. And then finally, I did
[00:50:14] CNA radio with Haranto Don and Andrea
[00:50:19] Hang. Uh this was one of the most fun
[00:50:22] interviews I've done. So, we'll listen
[00:50:23] in here. That's correct. Uh, let's take
[00:50:25] a look at Wall Street now. A mixed bag.
[00:50:27] The Dow closing 0.9% higher. Not so
[00:50:31] good. Uh, with the NASDAQ, though, at
[00:50:34] 0.8% decline, and the S&P 500 after
[00:50:37] notching that record high yesterday at
[00:50:40] 6204, it's come down some, just a little
[00:50:42] bit underwater at 6198. It's dropped
[00:50:46] 0.1%. That's what it translates to.
[00:50:49] Thomas Hayes joins us now for a closer
[00:50:52] look at what's happening. Uh he's
[00:50:53] chairman and managing member of great at
[00:50:55] Great Hill Capital. Thomas, before we
[00:50:57] get into it, I want to ask you for your
[00:50:59] opinion. How long do you think um youths
[00:51:02] need to stay in a job before they
[00:51:03] switch? I I think uh 20 to 40 years is
[00:51:07] about the correct answer.
[00:51:10] I'm guessing that's how long you stayed
[00:51:11] in your job. Well, you look, I run my
[00:51:14] own company, so it's it's easy to stay
[00:51:16] with your own job. Exactly. Yeah. Look,
[00:51:18] if you want to be here, here's my
[00:51:20] advice. If I see an application where
[00:51:21] the person is changing every 12 to 24
[00:51:24] months, it's going in the waistband. It
[00:51:26] shows no loyalty. It shows uh uh no
[00:51:29] consistency, no persistence, and it's a
[00:51:32] hard pass for me. I'm not going to
[00:51:33] invest in training them or working with
[00:51:35] them. So, uh look, a lot of people get
[00:51:37] away with it. It's it's called salary
[00:51:39] jumping because every job they'll pay
[00:51:41] you more than your last job. And I guess
[00:51:44] it's a way to game the system, but the
[00:51:45] question is, do you game yourself in the
[00:51:47] long term? And the answer is I would say
[00:51:50] yes. Yeah. Okay. So here's the other
[00:51:52] question. I just I'm just curious. Is
[00:51:54] this a trend that's happening where you
[00:51:56] are right now?
[00:51:58] Not in my company.
[00:52:02] Fair enough. Fair enough. Okay. So let's
[00:52:04] get down to business. Uh let's first
[00:52:06] talk about that top headline coming out
[00:52:08] of DC and that's uh the US trade deal or
[00:52:11] particularly Mr. Trump's comments uh
[00:52:13] relating to the deal with Japan. We're
[00:52:16] looking at a potentially 30 to 35%
[00:52:18] tariff on Japan uh up from the original
[00:52:21] 24%. Trump's not confident of a deal by
[00:52:24] July 9th. Are you?
[00:52:28] Uh yes. I think this is how Trump
[00:52:30] negotiates. So he did the same thing
[00:52:32] with Canada. They didn't want to release
[00:52:34] the digital service tax and he said
[00:52:37] fine. And they eventually did yesterday.
[00:52:40] Yeah. walking away from the table.
[00:52:42] Canada comes back and look, when he says
[00:52:44] he they don't hold the cards, he's
[00:52:45] absolutely right. The same is the case
[00:52:47] with Japan. We stopped taking their
[00:52:48] cars, their toast. Uh he's asking them
[00:52:51] to take a little rice. Why the Japanese
[00:52:52] would want US rice, I have no idea, but
[00:52:55] Trump wants them to take our rice, so
[00:52:57] they should take our rice because
[00:52:58] they're sending a lot of cars to the
[00:53:00] United States and we're buying a lot of
[00:53:01] their cars. Well, they're having a rice
[00:53:03] shortage in Japan and they're struggling
[00:53:05] a little bit. So, they should take that
[00:53:06] rice. Absolutely. All rice all the time.
[00:53:11] Okay. How are they going to make that
[00:53:12] beautiful sushi without US rice? There
[00:53:14] it is.
[00:53:17] Okay. So Tom, on the flip side, Treasury
[00:53:19] Secretary Scott Basson says deal with
[00:53:22] India is closed and it will and if it
[00:53:24] does go through, it will join Canada and
[00:53:27] the UK. What's going to be significant
[00:53:30] about this deal, do you think?
[00:53:32] Well, look, what's going to be
[00:53:33] significant is India maintains a
[00:53:35] positive relationship with the United
[00:53:37] States, which is critical for their
[00:53:38] growth. Uh we we certainly want to
[00:53:41] maintain a positive relationship with
[00:53:42] India. We want non-tariff barriers
[00:53:45] removed. We want a fair playing field
[00:53:47] for US businesses to be able to
[00:53:49] participate in India's great growth. And
[00:53:52] uh and I think that's going to be the
[00:53:53] outcome of this. And uh believe it or
[00:53:56] not, I I do think the tariff
[00:53:59] negotiations are a lot more about
[00:54:01] non-tariff barriers than they are about
[00:54:03] us collecting $300 billion of tariffs uh
[00:54:06] 10% from from countries around the
[00:54:08] world. Trump loves the money, but I
[00:54:11] think he likes the open uh fair level
[00:54:14] playing fields even more. Yeah. Well,
[00:54:16] the money is going to be a nice little
[00:54:17] bonus. Uh have have don't have never
[00:54:20] mind. You know, that's what they say in
[00:54:22] Singapore. Um, okay Tom, let's take a
[00:54:24] look at Wall Street now. There seems to
[00:54:26] be a rotation out of mega cap stocks or
[00:54:28] at least larger stocks to smaller buys.
[00:54:31] I mean, we saw the Russell 2000 beating
[00:54:33] the NASDAQ uh overnight. What's the
[00:54:36] rationale for this? I mean, what are
[00:54:37] investors thinking? And how much volume
[00:54:39] are we talking about here? Oh, let me
[00:54:42] tell you, Andrea, you're you're tugging
[00:54:43] at my heartstrings to hell with the Mag
[00:54:45] 7. I'm telling you, look, the
[00:54:48] unmagnificent 493 are going to
[00:54:50] outperform through the end of the year.
[00:54:52] And I'll tell you why. It's simple math.
[00:54:54] The Mag 7 had 27% earnings growth in
[00:54:57] first quarter of this year. They're
[00:54:59] going to have 10.2% earnings growth by
[00:55:01] first quarter of next year.
[00:55:03] Unmagnificent 493 had negative earnings
[00:55:05] growth the end of last year. By Q1 of
[00:55:08] next year, they're going to have 10.3%
[00:55:12] earnings growth, which means more
[00:55:14] earnings growth for much lower multiple,
[00:55:17] approximately half the multiple. And why
[00:55:20] is MAG 7's earnings growth declining so
[00:55:23] precipitously because they are massively
[00:55:26] spending on cap X? And most people would
[00:55:30] say, well, it's offensive. I would say
[00:55:31] it's defensive. They don't want to lose
[00:55:33] share and they're spending and we don't
[00:55:35] know what the return on investment is
[00:55:36] going to be. So as you saw today preview
[00:55:40] of coming attractions
[00:55:42] small caps dramatically outperforming
[00:55:44] and this big beautiful bill has put
[00:55:46] rocket fuel in that rotation. Um you
[00:55:50] know whether it's $10,000 uh interest
[00:55:53] deduction on new automobiles volumes
[00:55:56] have been anemic in the United States
[00:55:58] since co it's going to supercharge it.
[00:56:00] Why? because the average car on the road
[00:56:02] is 13.5
[00:56:04] years. Powell will get his head on
[00:56:06] straight and actually start cutting
[00:56:07] rates, which will help people get into
[00:56:09] cars. It'll help the millennials, as you
[00:56:11] said, as they hop from job to job. Also,
[00:56:13] buy a house and make babies. We need
[00:56:15] them to make babies. And by the way,
[00:56:17] with the new tax bill, if they make
[00:56:18] babies before 2028, their babies are
[00:56:21] going to get an investment account
[00:56:22] funded with $1,000 that's going to
[00:56:25] compound over time. So by the time
[00:56:26] they're 20, 30, 40, they're
[00:56:28] participating in the American dream with
[00:56:30] a massive head start. Wow. A dream
[00:56:32] before the person even exists. That's
[00:56:34] really nice. The Russell 2000 trending
[00:56:37] upwards of 1% by the way at the close of
[00:56:40] business. Tom, so talking about jobs,
[00:56:42] uh, US job openings hit the highest in 7
[00:56:45] months, largely due to summer
[00:56:47] holidaying, but layoffs were lower, too.
[00:56:49] What do you think we'll see when
[00:56:50] summer's over?
[00:56:52] Yeah, that's that's the million-dollar
[00:56:54] question because uh to force the Fed's
[00:56:57] hand, you do do need to see some
[00:56:59] weakness in the jobs growth. But we've
[00:57:01] gone from tariffs and bombs to tax cut
[00:57:03] tax cuts, deregulation, and growth. So,
[00:57:06] animal spirits are coming back. CEO
[00:57:08] confidence is coming back. It was in the
[00:57:10] toilet in early April. Uh they were they
[00:57:12] were hiding under their desks uh
[00:57:14] quivering in the fetal position. Now,
[00:57:16] they want to do deals. They want to make
[00:57:18] investments. They want to grow again. uh
[00:57:20] and that's a positive thing for the
[00:57:22] economy and this tax bill only exe uh
[00:57:25] enhances that because the tax job uh tax
[00:57:28] cuts and jobs acts is extended in
[00:57:32] perpetuity. So, a lot of constructive
[00:57:34] things happen. I'm really eager to see
[00:57:35] that jobs report on Friday because
[00:57:37] that's going to tell us a lot about when
[00:57:38] the Fed goes. Exactly. We'll get to the
[00:57:41] big beautiful bill in just a moment. Uh
[00:57:44] the US economy is likely going to chug
[00:57:46] along from the looks of it. Uh, and
[00:57:48] that's going to not to not to dampen
[00:57:50] your spirits yet, Tom, but it's it might
[00:57:52] just uh buy the Fed more time to cut
[00:57:55] rates. Uh, plus not forgetting Trump
[00:57:57] sticking with that 9 July deadline,
[00:58:00] which they feel needs to be priced into
[00:58:03] inflation. Uh, do you think a September
[00:58:06] cut now is too soon or do you think it's
[00:58:08] too late? September's too late. That's
[00:58:11] probably when it's going to happen. Uh,
[00:58:13] it should happen in July. Look, at the
[00:58:15] end of the day, this is about one. The
[00:58:17] Fed is supposed to be by mandate data
[00:58:19] dependent. They have now become
[00:58:20] prediction dependent. And it's been
[00:58:22] wrong. I mean, this is the guy in
[00:58:24] December of 2018 that said autopilot
[00:58:27] with quantitative easing and crashed the
[00:58:29] stock market 20% in a few weeks right
[00:58:31] before Christmas. Minutian had to come
[00:58:33] bail him out. Then he said inflation is
[00:58:36] transitory at the exact wrong time. Now
[00:58:38] he's worried about his legacy and not
[00:58:40] being Arthur Burns uh who cut too
[00:58:43] quickly in the 70s and it came back. The
[00:58:45] economic conditions and demographics are
[00:58:47] nothing like the 70s which tells you
[00:58:49] everything you know and why he shouldn't
[00:58:50] be in that position. He would have made
[00:58:51] a great Treasury Secretary by the way
[00:58:53] and I hear he's an incredible golfer.
[00:58:55] Fed chair not so much. But here we are.
[00:58:57] And what's going to happen is if he
[00:58:59] doesn't cut in July and uh alleviate the
[00:59:03] US taxpayer from paying $600 billion
[00:59:06] more in interest payments than we should
[00:59:08] be paying. Trump is going to announce
[00:59:10] his pick and it's going to be a shadow
[00:59:12] Fed president and Powell will be a lame
[00:59:16] duck till the end of his term in May of
[00:59:18] 2026. The market will immediately start
[00:59:20] to discount 200 basis points of cuts
[00:59:24] well before it happens. and nothing
[00:59:26] Powell does will matter. So if he's that
[00:59:30] interested in his legacy, he should do a
[00:59:32] 25 basis point cut in July, whether we
[00:59:35] have a little bit of inflation bump from
[00:59:37] tariffs or we don't. Because according
[00:59:39] to them in their brilliant summary of
[00:59:42] economic projections, they themselves
[00:59:44] acknowledge any bump will be like a
[00:59:47] one-time tax and temporary. They also in
[00:59:51] their brilliant predictions say that
[00:59:53] real GDP is going to decelerate to 1.4%.
[00:59:58] So if they're so damn confident in their
[01:00:00] projections, why didn't they cut 50
[01:00:02] basis points if real GDP is going to
[01:00:04] drop to 1.4%. You tell me. That's a
[01:00:08] million dollar question that we can't
[01:00:09] answer. Yeah. Okay. So, you know,
[01:00:11] talking about being good at golfing,
[01:00:14] let's swing to that big, beautiful bill.
[01:00:16] Now, it's passed the Senate, but before
[01:00:19] we get into the details, uh any chance
[01:00:22] we'll see a little choke at the House of
[01:00:24] Representatives,
[01:00:25] of course, that's how you get stuff. I
[01:00:28] mean, your your number one job as a
[01:00:29] politician is to get reelected. How you
[01:00:31] get reelected is you bring the bacon
[01:00:33] home to your constituents. So, yes,
[01:00:34] there's going to be problems in the
[01:00:36] House, but they'll get it through and
[01:00:37] they probably get it through before
[01:00:38] Independence Day. Um I mean, th this is
[01:00:42] just a phenomenal bill in every way.
[01:00:44] Look, every headline I'm reading is
[01:00:46] people aren't going to eat and uh no
[01:00:49] one's going to be able to go to the
[01:00:50] hospital. But the fact of the matter is
[01:00:52] it's going to create a ton of jobs, a
[01:00:54] ton of growth, and you can't cut your
[01:00:56] way to prosperity. All these people
[01:00:57] talking about the deficit are looking at
[01:00:59] one side of the equation. What they're
[01:01:01] not looking at is we need growth. The
[01:01:03] last time the US had debt to GDP of 120%
[01:01:06] was 1948. We got back to down to 63%
[01:01:11] within 10 years. Not through cutting our
[01:01:13] way to prosperity, but through growing
[01:01:15] our way through prosperity. Oh, and by
[01:01:17] the way, inflation ran above trend for
[01:01:20] those 10 years between 3 to 5%. But so
[01:01:23] did nominal GDP, and that helped bring
[01:01:26] the equation down. You cut your way,
[01:01:28] you're going to lose jobs, you're going
[01:01:30] to have deflation, and then you're going
[01:01:31] to really have a debt problem. So, you
[01:01:33] need tax cuts, you need deregulation,
[01:01:36] you got to let animal spirits go, and we
[01:01:38] got to run run GDP as hot as hell to
[01:01:41] bring that to GDP down uh to a
[01:01:43] reasonable level in the next 5 years,
[01:01:45] right? So, while uh while we're thinking
[01:01:48] about that, it is going to be passed
[01:01:50] through likely and there's going to be
[01:01:52] tax and spending cuts galore. Uh while
[01:01:55] that's closer to being realized, what
[01:01:57] kind of risks do you think traders will
[01:01:59] need to brace for then in the meantime?
[01:02:02] Well, you're going to have the
[01:02:03] day-to-day nonsense about the tariffs.
[01:02:05] Here's what you need to know. Markets
[01:02:06] climb a wall of worry. Okay, so two
[01:02:08] months ago, all these brilliant people
[01:02:10] when the market was down 20% were
[01:02:12] telling you to sell your stocks in the
[01:02:14] hole. These are the same idiots that are
[01:02:16] chasing stocks up at new highs that are
[01:02:18] being forced back into the market. Why?
[01:02:20] Because they want to keep their jobs.
[01:02:22] Unlike the real world, in investment
[01:02:23] management, people actually want to keep
[01:02:25] their jobs longer than two 12 to 24
[01:02:27] months. And how they do that is they
[01:02:29] closet index. and now they're behind the
[01:02:31] benchmarks and every single headline
[01:02:33] they're forced to buy more stock and
[01:02:35] that's going to continue for a while.
[01:02:37] Why? Because they sold a trillion
[01:02:38] dollars in the hole at the exact wrong
[01:02:40] time on April 7th and now they got to
[01:02:42] play catch-up or find a new job. So, uh
[01:02:45] the good news is we've got a $10,000 tax
[01:02:48] deduction on interest payments on new
[01:02:50] autos. So, if they want a new job,
[01:02:52] they'll be able to find it on the
[01:02:53] assembly line in in Detroit, Michigan
[01:02:55] making cars because there's going to be
[01:02:57] a lot of jobs created with that
[01:02:58] deduction.
[01:03:00] Well, Tom, this has been fun. Thank you
[01:03:02] so much for entertaining us uh this
[01:03:04] morning and really sharing your
[01:03:06] perspectives and your insights. We
[01:03:07] really appreciate it. We look forward to
[01:03:09] our next chat with you. Thank you very
[01:03:11] much. Have a great day. Yeah, same to
[01:03:13] you as well. And that was Thomas Hayes,
[01:03:16] uh chairman and managing member at Great
[01:03:18] Hill Capital, bringing us to the end of
[01:03:20] Open for Business on CN98. Yep. Coming
[01:03:23] right up, it's the morning rip
[01:03:26] and we're back. Quote of the week. I
[01:03:28] don't look to jump over seven foot bars.
[01:03:30] I look around for one foot bars that I
[01:03:33] can step over. That's Warren Buffett. We
[01:03:35] go for easy businesses that we
[01:03:37] understand that can be a quick
[01:03:38] turnaround. Uh two, three years, doubles
[01:03:41] and triples. Uh Buffett, your mind is
[01:03:43] like a bank. What you deposit is what
[01:03:45] you can withdraw. uh you continue to do
[01:03:48] that over time and um and you you make
[01:03:52] this vast uh savings account that
[01:03:56] compounds like money. Your knowledge
[01:03:57] compounds over time if you continue to
[01:04:00] feed it with the right inputs. I want to
[01:04:03] thank these incredible supporters. We
[01:04:05] got a lot more orders for these
[01:04:07] incredible hedge fund tips hats, golf
[01:04:09] shirts, mugs that you name it. And uh
[01:04:13] but a lot less people have sent in the
[01:04:14] pictures, but they're starting to
[01:04:15] trickle in. We got a shy audience out
[01:04:18] here. Don't know why this is not coming
[01:04:21] up. Let's see. Maybe it got held up in
[01:04:25] uh
[01:04:31] All right, we'll go back to that. I
[01:04:33] don't know why the pictures are not
[01:04:34] loading,
[01:04:37] but uh on to some data. Here's the
[01:04:42] sloomer over at RBC. You can see 10-year
[01:04:46] yield going down down in the range.
[01:04:49] Maybe a little counter trend bounce
[01:04:50] here, but the trend is lower. We're
[01:04:52] going to probably hit the bottom end of
[01:04:53] this range, 359. Mortgage rates below
[01:04:57] six, but before the end of the year.
[01:04:59] SLR's kicking in soon. Uh S&P 500
[01:05:03] breaking out. No one believed me in
[01:05:05] early April when I was saying bye bye
[01:05:07] bye. You can go back to the tapes. Now
[01:05:10] we are up some 20some percent. What an
[01:05:12] incredible year this has been. And um
[01:05:17] uh let's see here. Home builders
[01:05:19] starting to break this downtrend. This
[01:05:21] is a key theme for the second half.
[01:05:23] Biotech now starting to break the
[01:05:25] downtrend. How you doing? Uh and so on.
[01:05:29] So we got some good news there. Then
[01:05:32] we've got uh pod chart. So Chris Nelson
[01:05:36] to become CEO effective October 1st
[01:05:38] should be welcomed by investors. That's
[01:05:40] an upgrade to $90 price target for
[01:05:43] Stanley Black & Decker. They're going to
[01:05:45] have to take that up again. Uh here is
[01:05:48] Bank of America downgrading uh Albamaro
[01:05:51] in the hold despite
[01:05:53] um you can see here lithium prices are
[01:05:56] bottoming. Look at this starting to turn
[01:05:58] back up, but they still have a $93 price
[01:06:01] target on it. That thing's been on a
[01:06:03] tear lately. Intel got upgraded $28
[01:06:06] price target from Northland. Talking
[01:06:09] about the different nodes and the
[01:06:12] opportunities and basically Intel is the
[01:06:14] only alternative to Taiwan
[01:06:17] semiconductor. That's been core to our
[01:06:19] thesis since day one. You can read that.
[01:06:22] No one's talking about it, which is when
[01:06:23] we like to get involved. All the new
[01:06:25] money that's come in in the last week,
[01:06:27] it's been incredible. For the first time
[01:06:29] in a long time, I was able to put new
[01:06:32] clients into Alibaba because of the
[01:06:35] short-term pullback. Super excited about
[01:06:37] that. Intel, we got another bite at the
[01:06:40] apple. Now it's running away uh to the
[01:06:42] upside. So, super exciting time for
[01:06:45] those of you who have taken action.
[01:06:47] We're going to close out the raise
[01:06:48] earlier than normal. Usually, we keep it
[01:06:50] open for two weeks. We're closing it
[01:06:52] down in six days. If you're coming in,
[01:06:54] you need to do it now. If not, uh we'll
[01:06:56] revisit uh uh in uh October.
[01:07:02] Uh at some point, we're probably going
[01:07:03] to stop taking the million-dollar
[01:07:05] accounts. The business is just changing
[01:07:07] composition. We're getting a lot bigger
[01:07:09] allocations. Um but the people who have
[01:07:12] come in at a million will be
[01:07:13] grandfathered in and you'll be able to
[01:07:14] to stay with the small account. Uh
[01:07:17] brand, you know, inventory, most major
[01:07:20] brands are down after strong spring
[01:07:22] prices. Oh, inventory down on cars. So,
[01:07:25] they sold a lot ahead of the tariffs.
[01:07:27] Inventories are down. Production is
[01:07:29] going to have to come up. That's a good
[01:07:30] chart. Uh, durable goods orders through
[01:07:33] the roof. Uh, continuing jobless claims
[01:07:36] climb to highest level in 3.5 years. So,
[01:07:40] that should although we had some good
[01:07:41] labor numbers uh today, this should
[01:07:44] start to u certainly move them in
[01:07:46] September. We'll see about July.
[01:07:48] Probably not after today. spending on
[01:07:51] data centers expected to hit 1 trillion
[01:07:53] by 2030. Natural gas, all the other
[01:07:55] derivative plays we've talked about,
[01:07:57] GenerRack, backup generators, stocks
[01:07:59] have gained in July 10 years in a row.
[01:08:02] This will likely be the 11th. Uh gas
[01:08:05] demand inflation continues to be in the
[01:08:09] twos. Uh the Fed continues to pretend to
[01:08:13] predict the future. We covered enough of
[01:08:15] that in the media stuff. 64 rate cuts
[01:08:18] year to date, but none in the US. That's
[01:08:21] liquidity on a global basis is uh
[01:08:24] robust. S&P
[01:08:26] uh 500 on cusp of seventh great breakout
[01:08:29] since 1990%
[01:08:31] number of stocks at all-time highs. This
[01:08:33] this breath increased after the quarter
[01:08:36] ended. It was narrow the last couple of
[01:08:38] weeks of the quarter and then all of the
[01:08:40] sudden uh a a switch flipped and after
[01:08:44] the window dressing was done the all the
[01:08:46] money started flowing in the 493 small
[01:08:50] caps etc. And you saw weakness. Look at
[01:08:53] the euro. When I was pounding the table
[01:08:56] on this fourth quarter last year
[01:08:58] everyone was like no way and here we are
[01:09:01] uh approaching 120 on the euro. uh
[01:09:04] foreign investors have bought $128
[01:09:06] trillion of US assets since 1991.
[01:09:10] Fresh highs be get additional gains
[01:09:13] usually. So 12 months out, you can see
[01:09:16] now that we've broken out to a new high
[01:09:18] average is up another 13%
[01:09:22] 12 months later. Super exciting. Uh MSCI
[01:09:27] Europe versus MCI US.
[01:09:31] Uh
[01:09:33] there's nothing on this one, uh Jeff, so
[01:09:36] make sure you have descriptions. All
[01:09:39] right. Macro funds rapidly changed tack
[01:09:42] on stock. So they were sellers of a
[01:09:45] trillion in the hole in early April. Now
[01:09:47] they're massive buyers. That doesn't
[01:09:49] necessarily imply a top because they do
[01:09:51] this every single draw down. You can see
[01:09:54] you get this huge spike up and the
[01:09:56] market continues to climb a bit higher.
[01:09:59] Retail looks to be holding back for now.
[01:10:02] Treasury yields and the dollar index.
[01:10:04] This is important. The dollar index uh
[01:10:07] breaking through the lows. Um
[01:10:11] again, what what a difference a quarter
[01:10:13] and a half makes, two quarters make, how
[01:10:15] strong it was going into the year, and
[01:10:17] we said, "Hang on, this is a fake out."
[01:10:19] And it's just absolutely collapsed. So,
[01:10:21] what's the catch-up trade? The 10-year
[01:10:23] Treasury yield. Look at this divergence.
[01:10:25] These divergences are where we've made
[01:10:27] our money. uh uh materially over the
[01:10:30] years and I think you're going to catch
[01:10:32] down on treasury yields. Indian stocks
[01:10:35] trail aen everyone couldn't get enough
[01:10:38] India uh they've underperformed
[01:10:41] EM peers for the first time in years
[01:10:43] that's going to continue PBOC expected
[01:10:46] to ease monetary policy again this year
[01:10:49] average annual return in volatility of
[01:10:52] S&P 500 stocks 1973 to 2024
[01:10:58] uh dividend payers have had the highest
[01:11:00] returns ladies and gentlemen that's not
[01:11:02] been the case of late I think you're
[01:11:04] going to want to have some of those
[01:11:06] and um non-payers. So, that was flipped
[01:11:10] on its head with Zerp. Zerp is over.
[01:11:12] Don't get caught looking in the rear
[01:11:14] view mirror. You'll wind up driving into
[01:11:16] a wall.
[01:11:19] All right. Goldman Sachs. Uh uh we're
[01:11:22] going to skip that. A third of US burden
[01:11:25] by high housing costs. Thank you, Jay
[01:11:28] Powell. Electricity costs have soared
[01:11:30] since the pandemic.
[01:11:34] They're now starting to normalize a bit
[01:11:37] since the policy has changed. Bottomup
[01:11:40] Consensus expects Q 2Q S&P earnings
[01:11:44] growth will decelerate to 4% yearonear.
[01:11:47] Um,
[01:11:49] yeah, the numbers I look at say 5%, but
[01:11:51] that's down from 93, which sets the bar
[01:11:54] very low going into earnings season,
[01:11:55] which probably means we get some beats
[01:11:58] early out of the gate. we get a little
[01:12:00] bit more uh juice in the S SNP through
[01:12:03] the end of July. Uh and then we'll
[01:12:06] probably consolidate some of those gains
[01:12:07] certainly in the indices under the
[01:12:09] indices probably rotate and benefit from
[01:12:12] our positioning. Average cumulative S&P
[01:12:15] total returns
[01:12:17] uh invest on any day
[01:12:19] uh you have lower return. Invest at a
[01:12:21] new high you have higher returns. Um, so
[01:12:25] we've just had a new high in the S&P
[01:12:29] earnings revisions, breath upside
[01:12:31] inflections driven by more upward
[01:12:32] revisions. This is 12 month performance
[01:12:36] uh of the S&P again up 12%. So the other
[01:12:39] metric up 13%. It's just a mosaic of
[01:12:41] data points that we use to kind of take,
[01:12:43] you know, compile our outlooks and and
[01:12:45] these are inputs that that we consider
[01:12:48] something to keep in mind. implied
[01:12:50] dividend yield.
[01:12:52] Uh S&P 500 at the lowest.
[01:12:57] Euro stocks a bit higher. Nikk a bit
[01:13:00] higher than that.
[01:13:05] First half of July tends to have the
[01:13:08] highest 2- week S&P return since 1950.
[01:13:12] Almost 2% highest week uh two weeks of
[01:13:15] the year. Share of firsttime home buyers
[01:13:18] has declined from 50% to currently 24%
[01:13:21] compliments Jay Powell. Higher stock
[01:13:23] prices and rising real estate values
[01:13:25] boost households. Uh so you can see the
[01:13:29] household balance sheets are healthier
[01:13:31] than they have ever been. We covered
[01:13:34] that last week as well. S&P 500 bull
[01:13:37] markets. You can see where we are just
[01:13:38] having that draw down and where the
[01:13:40] average bull market goes over time. uh
[01:13:43] which shows a lot of runway which has
[01:13:46] been our base case. this thing goes to
[01:13:47] the 2030s that doesn't preclude 10% and
[01:13:50] 20% pullbacks like we've seen but the
[01:13:54] trend is there demographically
[01:13:55] economically speaking S&P 500 positive
[01:13:59] EPS guidance 5year
[01:14:02] okay we'll skip that CPI skip that
[01:14:05] coming down we know that defense
[01:14:08] spending as a share of GDP historic and
[01:14:10] projected you're seeing it in our Boeing
[01:14:12] is through the roof uh so we're excited
[01:14:15] about that and Hey, not to mention, it
[01:14:17] didn't hurt that they had the 30,000 uh
[01:14:20] bunker bombs that absolutely destroyed
[01:14:23] and set back Iran at least 2 years with
[01:14:26] their nuclear ambitions. Uh more bombs
[01:14:29] in the back pocket if needed. Boeing
[01:14:31] will be happy to supply and as owners,
[01:14:34] we will be happy to profit. Uh European
[01:14:37] stocks beat us by the most since 2006.
[01:14:41] This was another minority opinion we had
[01:14:43] last year. That's that's proven in
[01:14:46] spades this year. This will continue
[01:14:48] over time. This is like the early 2000s.
[01:14:51] Uh relative to the US ex US shares look
[01:14:54] as attractive as ever. How you doing
[01:14:57] ladies and gentlemen? US doesn't always
[01:14:59] win. These are the normal cycles. This
[01:15:02] doesn't mean we've lost our
[01:15:03] exceptionalism. We're never going to
[01:15:04] lose that because we are a melting pot
[01:15:06] of the best from around the world.
[01:15:07] Immigration has made us great legal
[01:15:10] immigration. My mother immigrated
[01:15:12] legally from Portugal when she was 16.
[01:15:15] Uh many great people uh have immigrated
[01:15:19] legally and contributed and most have
[01:15:22] migrated uh immigrated legally. So
[01:15:25] that's the theme. We should dramatically
[01:15:28] increase legal immigration. And um uh
[01:15:33] here are the cycles where you can see US
[01:15:35] underperformed. By the way, this was
[01:15:38] under Reagan's second term, which
[01:15:41] everyone would be shocked. US did fine,
[01:15:43] international did better. Same thing uh
[01:15:47] in the early 2000s that that stopped and
[01:15:50] then you went into ZERP where US
[01:15:52] outperformed
[01:15:54] uh dividend yield inexpensive versus
[01:15:57] history. So these are the Stanley Black
[01:16:00] & Deckers of the world. the Albamaro
[01:16:03] dividend aristocrat. We've covered
[01:16:05] dividend yield neglected by active
[01:16:07] managers. This game is going to be back
[01:16:09] on just like when 2001 to 2007. I can't
[01:16:13] emphasize that enough. For those of you
[01:16:15] who are new, uh you can go back to the
[01:16:17] old tapes on hedge funips.com and you
[01:16:20] can see how this stuff has played out.
[01:16:22] Growth versus value near record COVID
[01:16:24] highs. This is going to reverse and it's
[01:16:26] going to do so abruptly. And the last
[01:16:28] few days has been a preview of coming
[01:16:30] attraction. So, if you're jammed in
[01:16:32] indices passively and you don't realize
[01:16:35] you're fully exposed to MAG 7 or you're
[01:16:37] overweight MAG 7, uh, have a nice day.
[01:16:40] You're going to be less than satisfied
[01:16:42] prospectively. Dollar and those that
[01:16:45] have selective uh positioning, correct
[01:16:48] positioning in small cap value 493, the
[01:16:52] correct names international, you are
[01:16:55] going to make so much money. You're
[01:16:56] going to be smiling so wide you could
[01:16:58] eat a banana sideways. And you've
[01:16:59] already seen that year to date the
[01:17:01] clients and and we're going to see a lot
[01:17:02] more of that moving forward. Dollars
[01:17:05] worst start to the year in decades.
[01:17:06] Again,
[01:17:08] it was a very very lonely position uh in
[01:17:12] Q4 of last year. Supply of homes highest
[01:17:14] in once hot markets. So, this is good.
[01:17:17] This will start to normalize. rate cuts
[01:17:19] and SLR and Bessence play on the 10-year
[01:17:23] yield will um uh
[01:17:30] exacerbate this trend. Flexing their
[01:17:33] strain, Chinese brand shares growing in
[01:17:35] electrified auto segments. Uh just 55
[01:17:38] trading days back to the new highs.
[01:17:40] Average is 361.
[01:17:43] One of the fastest recoveries in
[01:17:44] history. And as we said on August 7th
[01:17:47] when we were telling you to buy
[01:17:48] everything and send I I'm most proud of
[01:17:51] the clients because I really pounded the
[01:17:53] table. If you're thinking about sending
[01:17:55] in new money, send it in now. And the
[01:17:57] only other time I've done that in my
[01:17:59] career. I've never asked anyone to
[01:18:01] invest. They just come to me from the
[01:18:02] podcast and from referrals. I've never
[01:18:04] sat down with someone with a pitchbook
[01:18:06] and said, "This is why Great Hill
[01:18:07] Capital is great." I don't do that. I've
[01:18:09] never optimized for for maximum aum.
[01:18:12] People, you know, start start with me.
[01:18:14] They see value, they get returns, they
[01:18:16] add more money, they give me referrals.
[01:18:18] That's how I do it. That's how I've
[01:18:19] always done it. And uh and why do they
[01:18:21] invest with me? Because they've already
[01:18:22] gotten tremendous value and made a ton
[01:18:24] of money off the podcast before they
[01:18:26] even call me. So, um but that was a time
[01:18:30] when I said, "Send money now." I
[01:18:32] literally did an emergency call on the
[01:18:35] 7th of April, went through for 35
[01:18:38] minutes every company in the portfolio,
[01:18:40] and I said, "This is Christmas. We need
[01:18:43] to buy as much as humanly possible. If
[01:18:45] you were thinking about sending in new
[01:18:46] money and we got so much money in such a
[01:18:48] short period of time that we were able
[01:18:50] to buy so much 28% below today, it was
[01:18:54] unbelievable. So kudos to you who had
[01:18:56] the courage in the face of fear. Uh and
[01:18:59] um and there's still so much opportunity
[01:19:01] out there. It's it's just exciting.
[01:19:03] Month monthly pension estimate. Okay, we
[01:19:05] covered that. Institutional clients are
[01:19:07] big net sellers post crisis. They we
[01:19:11] covered their their need to chase up uh
[01:19:14] in the media stuff. Weaker dollar. The
[01:19:16] weaker the dollar, the stronger the
[01:19:18] earnings growth, which we covered back
[01:19:20] half. There it's going to be a tailwind
[01:19:22] of the weaker dollar in the first half.
[01:19:24] You're going to see that cutting rates
[01:19:26] while
[01:19:29] uh
[01:19:31] US core CPI yearonear
[01:19:35] US funds 250 basis points higher than
[01:19:38] inflation. So unreal. Uh SN earnings
[01:19:44] sentiment S&P
[01:19:47] it accelerated off the lows. Now it's
[01:19:49] flatlining. Post-election years have
[01:19:51] been very strong lately. Uh that's this
[01:19:54] year average has been
[01:19:57] since 1985 up 18.1%.
[01:20:01] That's kind of interesting. Midterm
[01:20:03] years are the worst year, more subdued.
[01:20:06] So if you think you're going to get
[01:20:07] returns from indices next year, you're
[01:20:09] not. If you uh have an active manager
[01:20:12] that knows how to buy the correct
[01:20:14] lagards and turnarounds, you're going to
[01:20:15] make a fortune in that type of
[01:20:17] environment when the indices are doing
[01:20:18] nothing. um consolidated equity
[01:20:22] positioning still there's still power
[01:20:24] here to to move higher. People are
[01:20:27] really got caught off sides in April and
[01:20:30] May uh and June. What else you want to
[01:20:33] know? Ahead of the street again
[01:20:36] uh what do we got here?
[01:20:43] Total market cap of US versus the other
[01:20:45] regions. This what what's interesting
[01:20:48] about this is the percentage of global
[01:20:50] market cap that US equities have is not
[01:20:53] commensurate with the percentage of
[01:20:55] earnings power the US has. So there's a
[01:20:57] divergence there and that's going to
[01:20:58] normalize a reversion to the mean. Uh
[01:21:01] weights of these other regions are going
[01:21:04] to start to increase relative to the US
[01:21:06] because their earnings power is
[01:21:08] dramatically higher in percentage terms
[01:21:10] than the waiting in the global indices.
[01:21:13] So that mean reversion is coming to a
[01:21:15] theater near you. Look at home builders
[01:21:17] uh overthrow now they're coming back.
[01:21:20] That's going to be the second half story
[01:21:21] with rates. We're positioned like
[01:21:23] nobody's business for that which is
[01:21:25] going to be super exciting. Not in the
[01:21:27] homebuilders in other ancillary plays
[01:21:29] which are going to uh have much more
[01:21:31] operating leverage and better margins.
[01:21:33] Hong Kong listings in June hit the
[01:21:35] highest since December 2022. The game is
[01:21:38] on, ladies and gentlemen. Rotation in
[01:21:40] small cap, same story. We've talked
[01:21:41] about it the last few days. Share of TV
[01:21:44] consumption, traditional versus
[01:21:46] streaming. Who's winning? Disney, baby,
[01:21:48] how you doing? That thing's up some 50%
[01:21:51] in the last couple of months. Um, 81% of
[01:21:55] mortgaged homes have a rate below six.
[01:21:57] This is why I'm talking. Once we get
[01:21:59] below six, the game will be on. Uh, ADP
[01:22:02] non-farm payroll was weak. Today's jobs
[01:22:05] report was strong. Small cap showing
[01:22:07] relative signs of life. This is a
[01:22:10] positive divergence. Capex from all
[01:22:12] major hyperscalers. This is what's
[01:22:14] hurting their earnings growth.
[01:22:17] Uh slingshot is in play in 2025.
[01:22:21] Uh what do we have here? Performance
[01:22:23] after a negative Q1 and then up 10% in
[01:22:27] Q2.
[01:22:29] Uh final six-month return is up on
[01:22:32] average another 15% from Ryan's lips to
[01:22:37] God's ears. We shall see another bullish
[01:22:40] sign. Golden cross. Okay, you can see
[01:22:43] the data here one year later up 11%.
[01:22:46] These are just all data points in the
[01:22:48] mosaic. S&P sector performance in 2025.
[01:22:51] Discretionary, there's going to be a lot
[01:22:53] of opportunity here. The goosees, the
[01:22:55] van, the VFS, um, uh, etc. housing
[01:23:04] materials, Albamaro starting to
[01:23:06] absolutely rip higher. Uh, Crown Castle.
[01:23:09] I think second half is going to be a
[01:23:10] home run as rates come down. So, we got
[01:23:12] a lot of good stuff there. Transports,
[01:23:14] you're seeing it in. Okay.
[01:23:18] Uh,
[01:23:20] sell America story count. You can see
[01:23:24] all this. That's hysterical. Uh, at the
[01:23:26] lows now the story counts gone down. You
[01:23:28] can't make this stuff up. US allies to
[01:23:31] bump up their defense spending. That
[01:23:33] helps the likes of Boeing. I think those
[01:23:35] bunker busters are going to be a popular
[01:23:37] one. Um,
[01:23:40] oh, country index. Okay, that was a lot
[01:23:43] of data. Good job. China is quickly
[01:23:46] eroding America's lead in the global AI
[01:23:48] race. We've covered this. Alibaba, you
[01:23:51] start up deepseeek and e-commerce giant
[01:23:54] Alibaba as alternatives to American
[01:23:57] offerings such as chat GPT. I continue
[01:24:00] to say Alibaba is the cheapest AI play
[01:24:03] in the world. Not only is are their
[01:24:05] models superior in in objective tests,
[01:24:09] but uh they also have a piece of every
[01:24:12] single China AI startup because they
[01:24:14] give they give them free compute from
[01:24:16] their cloud business which is number one
[01:24:18] China. Think AWS for China in exchange
[01:24:21] for equity in all these companies. Most
[01:24:23] people don't know it's not yet accounted
[01:24:24] in the stock. But when you get a couple
[01:24:26] thousand baggers, people are going to
[01:24:28] start to pay attention. Alibaba ready $7
[01:24:30] billion boost for commerce use plans new
[01:24:34] data centers. You can read in the letter

[01:24:46] Hong Kong's first half IPO soared
[01:24:48] eightfold returning uh to world's top
[01:24:51] spot for capital. This is an unintended
[01:24:54] consequence of of wrong-minded US

[01:25:23] Assessing the impact of the SLR changes
[01:25:25] for big banks. We've covered this over
[01:25:27] and over. This will bring rates down.
[01:25:29] This will increase lending. This is
[01:25:31] going to be enormous uh for growth.
[01:25:34] Mortgage refinance demand surges as
[01:25:36] interest rates drop further. They

[01:25:49] Now, he's figured out another way to do
[01:25:51] it. This was part of our core housing

[01:26:37] Smiled so wide I could eat a banana

[01:27:03] wanted it at 85. Everyone wants it at
[01:27:06] 120. Still skeptics. And uh price target
[01:27:10] increased to 144 from 100. Next will be
[01:27:14] 180. And then it'll be a $200 stock a

[01:27:18] market and sentiment results article of
[01:27:21] the week. First and foremost, just want
[01:27:23] to thank uh let's thank all the media
[01:27:25] people. Katie Silver at BBC and Xiao D

[01:27:47] Not sure what is up with the podcast
[01:27:50] with the
[01:27:52] page here.
[01:27:57] Okay, while we got the pages working,
[01:27:59] want to acknowledge those who sent in
[01:28:01] their photos wearing the headphone tips
[01:28:04] merch. Uh we got a couple newer ones
[01:28:07] here. We covered a lot of these. Uh
[01:28:11] Aaron Oda and his beautiful family. Got
[01:28:14] just a bunch. We'll just recognize them
[01:28:17] real quick. All right, let's get to the
[01:28:19] article of the week. Goose on the loose
[01:28:21] stock market and sentiment results. Uh,
[01:28:23] so again, thanks to Katie Silver and Jao
[01:28:27] Dilva, Marian Star. Okay, we covered
[01:28:30] that. Canadia goo Canada Goose update.
[01:28:32] Each week we try to cover one to two
[01:28:34] companies we've discussed in previous
[01:28:35] podcast videocast and or own for clients

[01:28:52] anything. Disclaimer, disclaimer,
[01:28:54] disclaimer. All right. So, uh here's
[01:28:57] Canada Goose. You can see here price is
[01:29:00] down. C free cash flow is at record
[01:29:02] highs. We love these divergences. We
[01:29:04] make made our fortune doing this over
[01:29:06] and over. We're going to continue to do
[01:29:08] that for clients. Uh, and um, we love
[01:29:12] buying things that are not in the
[01:29:14] headlines that no one wants and selling
[01:29:15] when they're in the headlines every day
[01:29:17] and everyone wants free cash flow just
[01:29:20] rocking and rolling. Earnings
[01:29:22] recovering, revenues recovering. Here's
[01:29:24] why. A few weeks ago, we put out a quick
[01:29:26] update following Canada Goose's Q4
[01:29:29] earnings, but have not yet put out a
[01:29:30] full deep dive. Despite the 70% move off
[01:29:33] the April lows, we don't even think the
[01:29:35] train has left the station yet with this
[01:29:37] name. That said, we thought now would be
[01:29:40] a good time to revisit it. Canada Goose,
[01:29:42] like many other names, went from a
[01:29:44] flashy growth story to a left for dead
[01:29:46] value story post pandemic and during the
[01:29:48] cyclical consumer draw down that
[01:29:50] followed. Uh, similar to PayPal, by the
[01:29:52] way, which is on an absolute tear
[01:29:54] lately. Luckily for us, this once in
[01:29:56] aundred-year event gave us the
[01:29:58] opportunity to purchase what we believe
[01:30:00] is one of the highest quality familyrun
[01:30:01] luxury brands amid an 85% draw down and
[01:30:04] near all-time lows. The good news is we
[01:30:07] believe that over time Goose has the
[01:30:08] potential and all the right pieces to
[01:30:10] return to growth story as management
[01:30:12] executes its turnaround plan and gets a
[01:30:14] little help from the recovery of Chinese
[01:30:16] consumer and the shift toward a
[01:30:19] consumption-based economy. The name of
[01:30:21] the game with Goose turnaround is
[01:30:23] reducing exposure to wholesale and
[01:30:24] leaning into high margin DTC stores.
[01:30:27] Back in 2017, DTC made up just 29% of
[01:30:31] total revenue. This past fiscal year,
[01:30:33] that number had grown to 74% with
[01:30:35] management targeting 80% by fiscal year
[01:30:38] 2028.
[01:30:40] The biggest upside from that shift is
[01:30:42] the margin profile with DTC typically
[01:30:44] commanding margins in the mid 70% range
[01:30:47] compared to wholesale in the mid to high
[01:30:49] 40% range. Beyond the material
[01:30:51] profitability upside, the model also
[01:30:54] enables better brand quality control,
[01:30:55] higher conversion rates, improved
[01:30:57] inventory management, and greater
[01:30:58] operational efficiency. But those are
[01:31:00] just words.
[01:31:02] The real question is whether management
[01:31:04] can execute, and they're doing just
[01:31:06] that. Inventories have declined for six
[01:31:08] straight quarters down to just $384
[01:31:11] million and 14% lower year-one. DTC
[01:31:14] revenues jumped 15.7% in Q4 with comp
[01:31:18] sales up 6.8%. Re wholesale revenues
[01:31:22] fell 23.2% in the quarter to just 31.8 8
[01:31:26] million with fiscal year 2026 expected
[01:31:28] to be the trough as nearly all
[01:31:30] intentional cuts are now behind goose.
[01:31:34] Most importantly and as expected, gross
[01:31:36] margins hit record highs coming in just
[01:31:39] under 70% for the full year and showing
[01:31:41] no signs of slowing as management pushes
[01:31:43] toward its low 70% range target. So with
[01:31:48] DTC taking care of business on the
[01:31:50] profitability front, the next question
[01:31:52] and other prong of the turnaround plan
[01:31:54] is centered around reacelerating revenue
[01:31:56] on grow revenue growth. On that front,
[01:31:58] management is effectively turning Goose
[01:32:00] from a purely winter one-time purchase
[01:32:02] luxury parker brand into an allseason
[01:32:05] 365day relevant brand. This past year,
[01:32:08] Goose nearly doubled its mix of updated
[01:32:11] and brand new styles. Whether it's rain
[01:32:13] jackets, eyewear, shoes, or even warm
[01:32:15] weather clothing, Canada Goose now has
[01:32:17] it. Most importantly, people can't get
[01:32:19] enough. Apparel emerged as the fastest
[01:32:21] growing category in Q4. And for the full
[01:32:24] fiscal year 2025 with downfilled
[01:32:26] outerware also seeing very solid growth.
[01:32:29] This continues to drive more repeat
[01:32:31] customers and multi-unit purchases,
[01:32:33] something Goose had never traditionally
[01:32:35] had. And once again, the success is
[01:32:37] showing up in the data with this past
[01:32:40] year's holiday season search interest
[01:32:42] hitting a 3year
[01:32:44] high. Oh, and by the way, the turnaround
[01:32:47] is being led by a CEO chairman from the
[01:32:49] founding family who owns 39.5% of the
[01:32:51] entire company. How's that for skin in
[01:32:53] the game? Just as you'd expect when
[01:32:55] management has that skin in the game,
[01:32:57] they tend to respect shareholder equity.
[01:32:59] Over the last 5 years, they have reduced
[01:33:01] the share count by nearly 12%, making
[01:33:03] your slice of the pie that much bigger
[01:33:06] without putting up any additional
[01:33:07] capital. Remember, price is what you
[01:33:09] pay, value is what you get. In the case
[01:33:11] of Goose, all signs point to
[01:33:13] strengthening fundamentals. You have
[01:33:14] record high gross margins, revenues
[01:33:17] reacelerating, and near record free cash
[01:33:19] flow. Yet, the price remains subdued. I
[01:33:21] built my career on capturing divergences
[01:33:23] like this rather than overthinking it.
[01:33:25] We are happy to sit on our hands and
[01:33:27] wait for Mr. market to be done serving
[01:33:29] up one of his manic bouts. Here's
[01:33:31] everything you need to know about Q4
[01:33:34] results. So, you can go through this at
[01:33:36] hedge funips.com
[01:33:38] uh and all the initiatives. Top 10 key
[01:33:41] points. Q revenue Q4 revenues grew 7.4%
[01:33:45] year-on-year to 384 beating expectations
[01:33:47] of 28.2
[01:33:50] by 28.2 million. This was driven by DTC
[01:33:53] revenue growth of 15.7% and comp sales
[01:33:56] growth of 6.8. 8% year-on-year with
[01:33:59] higher conversion rates across every
[01:34:01] region. Two, gross margins continue to
[01:34:03] benefit from the push to DTC coming in
[01:34:05] ahead of expectations at 71.3% for the
[01:34:08] quarter, up 620 basis points
[01:34:10] year-over-year and 69.9% for the full
[01:34:13] year. Adjusted EBIT margins came in at
[01:34:15] 15.5%
[01:34:16] up 430 basis points year. Three,
[01:34:19] management continues to make solid
[01:34:21] progress. right sizing inventories which
[01:34:23] have declined 14% year-onear to 348
[01:34:26] million 384 million and marked the sixth
[01:34:28] consecutive quarter of reductions.
[01:34:30] Inventory turnover also improved to 1.1
[01:34:33] times from.9 times last fiscal year.
[01:34:36] Four management continues to clean up
[01:34:37] the balance sheet reducing net debt
[01:34:39] leverage to 1.3 times compared to two
[01:34:42] times in the prior year. Cash and cash
[01:34:44] equivalents totaled 334 million at the
[01:34:46] end of the quarter up from 144 million a
[01:34:48] year earlier. Five tariffs are not
[01:34:52] expected to have a direct material
[01:34:53] impact on fiscal year 2026
[01:34:55] profitability. 75% of the units are made
[01:34:58] in Canada and virtually all comply with
[01:34:59] the United States messa
[01:35:01] making them currently exempt. The
[01:35:03] remaining 25% of units are produced in
[01:35:05] Europe which is expected to have minimal
[01:35:06] financial impact. Six wholesale revenues
[01:35:09] declined 22.3% in Q4 to 31.8 million and
[01:35:13] fell 16.5% for the full year. The
[01:35:15] decline is part of the intentional
[01:35:17] strategy to reduce the wholesale order
[01:35:18] book and shift toward higher margin DTC.
[01:35:21] Fiscal year 2026 is expected to be the
[01:35:23] trough for wholesale as streamlining
[01:35:25] efforts are mostly complete with
[01:35:27] management expecting growth from this
[01:35:29] point forward supported by strong
[01:35:31] interest from wholesale partners in the
[01:35:33] spring summer and fall winter 25
[01:35:35] collections. Seven. Goose continues to
[01:35:37] successfully expand into the non-winter
[01:35:40] category as it works to become an
[01:35:41] allseason relevant brand, nearly
[01:35:43] doubling the mix of updated and brand
[01:35:45] new styles during the year. Interest in
[01:35:46] new products and categories remain
[01:35:48] strong with downfilled outerwear showing
[01:35:50] solid growth and apparel emerging as
[01:35:53] fastest growing category in Q4 and for
[01:35:56] the full fiscal year. Data also shows a
[01:35:59] rising number of repeat customers and
[01:36:01] multi-unit purchases driven by the
[01:36:03] ongoing apparel expansion. Eight for the
[01:36:06] full year, Goose converted two temporary
[01:36:08] stores and opened four net new permanent
[01:36:12] stores, bringing the total store count
[01:36:13] to 74. Management continues to expect
[01:36:15] total net store openings to exceed
[01:36:18] fiscal year 2025 levels in the upcoming
[01:36:20] year. Nine. Goose. Similar to advanced
[01:36:24] auto parts, you don't expand stores when
[01:36:26] you are um uh not doing well. Uh the in
[01:36:31] other words, all the costs are in the
[01:36:33] rearview mirror. Now we go into growth
[01:36:35] mode on both counts. Nine. Goose ended
[01:36:37] the year with a corporate headcount
[01:36:39] reduction at 3% compared to the start of
[01:36:40] the year following the 17% reduction in
[01:36:43] March 2024. This brought fullear SGA
[01:36:46] SGNA expenses down to 779 compared to
[01:36:50] 792 million in the prior year and 10
[01:36:53] management did not provide guidance for
[01:36:54] the fiscal year 2026 outlook but remains
[01:36:56] confident in the strength of the brand
[01:36:58] and its solid financial position.
[01:37:00] Importantly, the decision to withhold
[01:37:01] guidance was driven by macro and tariff
[01:37:03] uncertainty rather than any weakness
[01:37:05] seen in consumer spending. In fact,
[01:37:07] management has been seen positive sales
[01:37:09] momentum continue into the early part of
[01:37:11] fiscal year 2026. Here's the earnings
[01:37:14] call transcript. You can go through that
[01:37:15] at hedge funfundtips.com.
[01:37:19] Uh, general market sentiment, fear and
[01:37:21] greed is elevated but not at extreme.
[01:37:23] Level 66. National Association of Active
[01:37:26] Investment Managers have had to chase
[01:37:28] up. Now they've kind of paused. Markets
[01:37:30] hitting new highs. They'll have to chase
[01:37:32] back up to extremes. Congratulations to
[01:37:34] all the new clients that came in during
[01:37:35] our Q1 and Q2 2025 raises. you cannot be
[01:37:39] better positioned for what we believe
[01:37:41] will continue to be a highly rewarding
[01:37:43] remainder of the year in 2025. This view
[01:37:47] is based on what has already taken place
[01:37:49] in 2025 as well as much of the data we
[01:37:52] have shared in recent weeks podcast
[01:37:53] video cast coupled with our proprietary
[01:37:55] methods of expressing and executing upon
[01:37:57] those views
[01:37:59] on your behalf. As of July 1st, we are
[01:38:03] now accepting smaller accounts of $1
[01:38:06] million plus for our Q3 opening. We will
[01:38:09] close this opening earlier than normal
[01:38:11] this quarter, and we'll stop accepting
[01:38:13] these accounts after July 9th. So,
[01:38:17] between now and July 9th, if you're
[01:38:19] coming in at the million-doll size, if
[01:38:21] you're coming in at the normal size of 5
[01:38:24] or 10 million plus, uh you can come in
[01:38:26] at your leisure at any time. But for the
[01:38:30] smaller accounts, we open it for small
[01:38:32] windows. Congratulations to all of you
[01:38:34] had had this pleasure of speaking with
[01:38:35] and onboarding last week when we opened
[01:38:37] up the queue for inquiries. Many of you
[01:38:39] have already had your applications
[01:38:41] approved by Interactive Brokers. So, we
[01:38:43] have begun deploying capital on your
[01:38:44] behalf in recent days. To see if you
[01:38:47] qualify and to take advantage of this
[01:38:48] opening clip here. Larger normal size
[01:38:50] accounts of 5 to 10 million plus can
[01:38:53] access bespoke service at their
[01:38:54] preference here. Not a solicitation,
[01:38:57] opinion, not advice. C terms. Consult
[01:39:00] with everyone under the sun before you
[01:39:02] do anything. Um, moving along. Retail
[01:39:06] earnings estimates, top 30 weights, uh,
[01:39:10] revisions in the last 60 days. Retail
[01:39:13] down by 52 basis points. And for this
[01:39:16] year, 83 basis points. For next year, I
[01:39:19] think there's going to be some ponies in
[01:39:20] that pile. transport earnings because as
[01:39:23] of what I discussed with David, how they
[01:39:25] pulled forward before the tariffs and uh
[01:39:28] uh now they're spending on services,
[01:39:31] they'll go back to goods. You got back
[01:39:33] to school coming up. Um so you want to
[01:39:35] take advantage of that. Uh this is for
[01:39:38] transports are down. Let's see who got
[01:39:41] hit the most here.
[01:39:44] Um,
[01:39:47] looks like FedEx uh had a big impact on
[01:39:50] this.
[01:39:52] I keep looking at there's going to be a
[01:39:54] pony in the pile for FedEx and UPS I
[01:39:56] think at some point. It's just not yet.
[01:39:58] But in the meantime, it drags and then
[01:40:00] what's this company? MATX.
[01:40:05] Yeah, those are kind of the big hits on
[01:40:07] that economic data. Uh, let's take a
[01:40:11] look. I want to see the jobs numbers
[01:40:14] today. You can see continuing claims
[01:40:17] higher than expected which we covered.
[01:40:20] Initial jobless claims were 233,000.
[01:40:25] Unemployment rate down to 4.1%.
[01:40:32] Private nonpart farm payrolls were much
[01:40:34] lower than expected in June. 74,000
[01:40:37] versus 105,000
[01:40:39] versus 137,000 last year last uh last
[01:40:43] month.
[01:40:46] All right. Non-manufacturing was a
[01:40:50] little weak and that's that tomorrow's
[01:40:52] Independence Day. So, with that said,
[01:40:55] uh, and then, um, estimates for 2026
[01:40:58] remain up around 300 bucks. I'm pretty
[01:41:00] sure 264 this year. Do they not have?
[01:41:04] Yeah, they have it. $3005.
[01:41:08] Guidance will be the name of the game as
[01:41:09] we start earnings season. Uh, podcast
[01:41:11] over. Now, we're going to move to
[01:41:14] uh, ask me anything questions.
[01:41:17] So, if you like those and get value,
[01:41:19] stick around. For the rest of you, we'll
[01:41:20] see you next week. Same time, same
[01:41:22] place. We might be a day early next week
[01:41:24] because I've got to travel on the 10th.
[01:41:27] Robert Edwards asks, "Uh, thoughts on
[01:41:30] GPN? I know you own PayPal." We covered
[01:41:33] this last week. Uh, for us, it's it's a
[01:41:37] pass, so I'm going to just skip that
[01:41:39] because we get asked that every single
[01:41:42] week. Johnny C,
[01:41:46] uh, could the price on com go higher?
[01:41:48] Yes, they got a pullback this week on
[01:41:50] some delilution, but that story is
[01:41:54] halfway through. It's not over yet
[01:41:56] despite the huge runup. Cameron Franco
[01:42:02] difference between ADP and BLS. It's
[01:42:04] just short-term noise. There's there's
[01:42:05] no kind of rhyme or reason. It happens
[01:42:07] every month and it's been more
[01:42:09] pronounced in recent months. So, I would
[01:42:11] none of none of that analysis is
[01:42:13] anything that's going to make you any
[01:42:14] money. So, I wouldn't spend much time on
[01:42:16] it. Um,
[01:42:19] guy from Germany wants to become a
[01:42:22] client. I'll email you back.
[01:42:29] Um,
[01:42:32] been watching your picks fly.
[01:42:37] Uh, must be your best week ever.
[01:42:42] Uh, if there was an MVP for 2025 stock
[01:42:45] picks, you would be getting my vote all
[01:42:47] day. Well done, sir. Thank you very
[01:42:48] much. It's very kind of you, Lee.
[01:42:52] Uh,
[01:42:54] is Etsy still on your radar? Yes, that's
[01:42:56] uh we added that for brand new clients
[01:42:58] this week. Record free cash flow, buying
[01:43:00] back stock uh and uh turning around. So,
[01:43:04] we there there's nothing to think about
[01:43:06] there. We're we're perfectly happy with
[01:43:08] it and put it as a new position. Uh,
[01:43:11] Lucas,
[01:43:13] share it with all friends. Thank you.
[01:43:16] All right. He's asking about the VIP
[01:43:18] structure. Uh, we own most of that in
[01:43:21] Hong Kong. We own a little Baba still.
[01:43:23] We might switch it over, but um, I think
[01:43:26] that was more of a fear before China and
[01:43:30] the US had a quote deal framework. That
[01:43:33] was just a threat to push them to the
[01:43:35] table. So, I don't think there's real
[01:43:36] risk in that in the short term. Goran
[01:43:39] Stogic uh famous Warren Buffettly
[01:43:42] famously said that turnaround seldom
[01:43:44] turn. I don't think that's true. Uh they
[01:43:46] did seldom turn for Buffett who bought
[01:43:49] uh IBM when uh that lady was running it
[01:43:52] into the ground. But IBM was a big
[01:43:55] enough business. It's now turned around.
[01:43:57] Sooner or later, a business that that
[01:43:59] has that big of a moat that's been
[01:44:02] around that long, eventually they're
[01:44:04] going to change the CEO, Jenny Romdy.
[01:44:06] The problem is is Buffett liked her
[01:44:08] because he kept telling her to buy back
[01:44:10] stock and she kept doing it. She was a
[01:44:12] saleswoman, not an engineer. And um but
[01:44:16] she took her eye off the ball of
[01:44:17] innovation. And when they got the guy in
[01:44:18] from Red Hat, it changed the game and
[01:44:20] it's off. So uh turnaround seldom turn.
[01:44:23] Look, if you've been watching me for 5
[01:44:25] years, we've done, you know, three dozen
[01:44:27] turnarounds that have been doubles,
[01:44:29] triples, quadruples, etc. Uh so yeah, if
[01:44:32] you don't know how to do it, they don't
[01:44:34] turn. But if you do know what you're
[01:44:35] doing, which takes decades of experience
[01:44:38] and uh a lot of nuance that you can't
[01:44:40] possibly understand uh until you do it
[01:44:43] that long, then it's one of the greatest
[01:44:46] ways to make money in the history of
[01:44:47] mankind in my view. I I would do it no
[01:44:50] other way. Um
[01:44:54] uh are there any turnarounds you ever
[01:44:55] gave up? Uh I you know I would say there
[01:45:00] was one I almost gave up on and that was
[01:45:03] Range Resources. We bought at 11 bucks
[01:45:06] in 2018. It was down from 90. Uh
[01:45:10] immediately not immediately went up to
[01:45:12] $18. We thought we were geniuses. Then
[01:45:14] COVID came. It dropped down to a buck
[01:45:17] 60. We backed up the truck. We bought
[01:45:19] our B brought our basis down to $4 and
[01:45:22] change and and now it's at uh over
[01:45:25] around $40. So it's a 10 bagger in seven
[01:45:29] years and probably going to 60 is which
[01:45:32] is where we initially underwrote it
[01:45:35] before we got involved. We know where
[01:45:37] we're getting out of businesses before
[01:45:38] we even get started. So because that
[01:45:40] because of how we do analysis um
[01:45:44] so uh so that'll be a 15 bagger in seven
[01:45:47] years. So, the impatient person like
[01:45:49] Buffett blew out of IBM at the lows and
[01:45:52] and it now probably would have been a a
[01:45:54] double plus for him. Uh maybe a triple.
[01:45:57] Um
[01:46:00] but he liked Jenny too much. He didn't
[01:46:02] want Jenny fired and and he was the kind
[01:46:04] of the the decision maker because of the
[01:46:06] amount of stock that he owned. So, um
[01:46:10] there there is one that he did stick
[01:46:11] with called BYD in China. 11 years the
[01:46:15] stock did nothing. had three 50% plus
[01:46:18] draw downs and then in the 12th year it
[01:46:20] was a 10bagger. So 10bagger over 101 12
[01:46:22] years it starts to work and that was
[01:46:25] Charlie's doing who kept him in the game
[01:46:27] long enough. Uh but if you look back at
[01:46:29] Buffett's partnership days that's all he
[01:46:31] did that's how he outperformed. So it
[01:46:34] just comes down to the capital structure
[01:46:36] that you have and um uh that basically
[01:46:40] turnarounds are what made Buffett uh
[01:46:42] more than anything else because if he
[01:46:44] didn't have the returns in the
[01:46:45] partnership like you see from doing
[01:46:47] turnarounds right uh he would have never
[01:46:49] got control of the Birkshire Hathaway
[01:46:51] vehicle and the insurance float and the
[01:46:53] permanent capital and the rest is
[01:46:55] history. No one ever like him. No one
[01:46:57] ever will. The best in the world of all
[01:47:00] time. Jimmy Jones
[01:47:06] Uh, oh, so Jimmy Jones is asking, "Why
[01:47:08] is the share count up?" It's It's up
[01:47:10] like five shares. It's literally up five
[01:47:12] sh It's like nothing. The reason is is
[01:47:14] because they bought back every share
[01:47:16] under the sun at 60 to $80. Uh, and uh,
[01:47:20] now it's at 110 120. they they reduce
[01:47:24] the buyback because now they've found
[01:47:26] places that they can get a higher return
[01:47:28] on invested capital than the 10%
[01:47:31] earnings yield from buying in stock. So
[01:47:33] they they're expecting they can get 20%
[01:47:35] plus return on capital investing in AI
[01:47:38] investing in their core business. So
[01:47:40] they still have some level of executive
[01:47:43] comp and if they're not buying shares,
[01:47:44] it's going to increase the count
[01:47:46] modestly. But if you look how much
[01:47:47] they've brought it down, this is just a
[01:47:50] rounding error and you're you're focused
[01:47:51] on the wrong thing. Uh unknown.
[01:47:55] Would you ever do a distressed for
[01:47:57] control or loan to own type of
[01:48:01] investment? Buying fulcrum security. If
[01:48:03] you're buying a fulcrum security, the
[01:48:05] business is completely uh a train wreck
[01:48:08] and I want nothing to do with it. Jason
[01:48:11] Greenblat, love the content. Uh,
[01:48:13] Consensus Cloud Solutions, CCSI.
[01:48:17] Let's take a look.
[01:48:21] I know Jason's been watching for a
[01:48:23] while.
[01:48:39] Revenues have just been flat.
[01:48:43] cash flow collapsed. It's trying to
[01:48:45] recover. It's not
[01:48:47] uh it looks like the their moat has been
[01:48:50] breached and they don't have anything
[01:48:51] innovative and unique is what I'm
[01:48:54] reading in this. Uh
[01:48:58] uh this hasn't been around long enough
[01:49:00] for me to to be interested. I like to
[01:49:03] see how businesses operate through many
[01:49:05] cycles and I I don't like these that are
[01:49:07] around for two, three years and had a
[01:49:09] run and got collapsed and they look like
[01:49:11] they're stalling out. Uh Jim,
[01:49:21] okay, Jim, I already called. Uh he's
[01:49:23] coming in. Great. Uh Mark Callaway,
[01:49:26] let me just see something here.
[01:49:35] Okay. Can't Mark Callaway says, "Hi,
[01:49:37] Tom. I can't thank you enough for all
[01:49:39] the time and effort you give your
[01:49:40] community of followers for free. I have
[01:49:43] just made shy of $100,000 following your
[01:49:45] advice." Oh, congratulations. Um, I am
[01:49:49] inching closer daily to meeting the
[01:49:51] qualified clients requirements for you
[01:49:52] to manage my money and I'm looking
[01:49:54] forward to the day immensely. Me, too.
[01:49:56] And congratulations on that. Uh, if your
[01:50:00] free content is this valuable, I can
[01:50:01] only imagine what your results for
[01:50:03] actual paying clients is. Yes, that's
[01:50:05] absolutely correct, Mark. Um, and this
[01:50:09] year they're seeing it in spades. My
[01:50:11] question today is with Housing Supply
[01:50:13] and uh home ownership act being stripped
[01:50:16] from the big bill, does this lessen your
[01:50:18] conviction in Stanley Black & Decker,
[01:50:20] Generrack, and QXO? No. No. No. There's
[01:50:23] a lot of good stuff in the in the
[01:50:24] housing bill. mortgage interest
[01:50:26] deduction, the $5,000 credit to new home
[01:50:29] buyers. Uh there's a ton of housing
[01:50:32] positive stuff in that, but the most
[01:50:34] important thing is going to be rates
[01:50:35] coming down. So, congratulations on your
[01:50:38] success and uh look forward to welcoming
[01:50:41] you in the future and keep it up. Way to
[01:50:44] go. Joshua Kaplan,
[01:50:48] can you talk about sell rules, position
[01:50:49] resizing, tax considerations after big
[01:50:51] moves?
[01:50:53] uh it not in a vacuum. I can do it in
[01:50:57] the context of an exact portfolio and
[01:51:00] positioning and analysis of each
[01:51:02] individual stock. Like some of them I'll
[01:51:04] let them go to a huge percentage of the
[01:51:06] portfolio because the fundamentals keep
[01:51:08] improving. So there's no like
[01:51:12] rule of thumb. Um it it's
[01:51:16] there's a lot of nuance. Do you think
[01:51:17] Hawaiian Electric can have a similar
[01:51:19] turnaround to PG&E? We played PG&E. Uh,
[01:51:22] Hawaiian.
[01:51:24] I keep looking at it and keep doing
[01:51:26] nothing. Um,
[01:51:30] I just don't like
[01:51:34] Yeah, I I just don't love dead money for
[01:51:38] so long waiting for government to make a
[01:51:40] decision. It's kind of a binary gamble
[01:51:42] and you win, gamble and you lose. Uh, I
[01:51:46] don't know enough there yet to have
[01:51:47] confidence, but I think you're on the
[01:51:49] right trail, but you got to do a lot of
[01:51:51] work. Thoughts on Polaris PII? This is
[01:51:54] consumer discretionary. All this is is a
[01:51:56] wrapped up rate play and I think the
[01:52:00] time is finally right for that. I think
[01:52:03] you'll be okay.
[01:52:05] Uh, Brian Fiserve, longtime listener,
[01:52:10] huge fan. FI
[01:52:18] not for me.
[01:52:23] I just don't see a quick double or or
[01:52:25] triple in the next few years doing this.
[01:52:27] I think you'll, you know, probably make
[01:52:29] some gains, but it's not
[01:52:34] I'm not clamoring to get shares. I I
[01:52:36] think you're okay. Uh, I just don't
[01:52:38] think it's the highest and best use of
[01:52:40] capital. Uh, let's take a look at Eric
[01:52:43] Klein.
[01:52:45] Why not Airbus over Boeing?
[01:52:48] Um, Airbus doesn't have the same defense
[01:52:51] business and uh, and there's not enough
[01:52:53] turnaround in it. So, Boeing has been a
[01:52:55] monster. If you go back to Vney a few
[01:52:58] months ago when we were just pounding
[01:53:00] the table at 135, now it's 214 and it's
[01:53:04] going higher. So, nothing else to think
[01:53:06] about. Uh, Johnny S,
[01:53:09] I also don't like you can't fire people
[01:53:11] in France. I mean, it's just it's
[01:53:13] unreal. Uh, looking at Brown Foreman,
[01:53:15] just want to know why you prefer Dagio
[01:53:17] over this one. This from Johnny S. Uh,
[01:53:19] premiumization. Uh, that's the name of
[01:53:22] the game. Middle class growth. Same
[01:53:24] story as Estee Lauder. Emerging markets,
[01:53:27] the whole thing. People drinking less,
[01:53:28] higher quality, higher margin business.
[01:53:31] Uh, if I was going to go down your
[01:53:33] route, then you start to look at, you
[01:53:35] know, I don't drink much, but when I do,
[01:53:36] it's a Coors Light. I grew up in Jersey.
[01:53:39] I'm a simple guy. But I wouldn't buy
[01:53:41] Molson Kors because it's just a low low
[01:53:43] margin garbage. Not an ideal great
[01:53:46] business. So, uh, hard pass. Uh, JD
[01:53:51] Sports. This is, uh, Jay Gallant.
[01:53:56] Let's take a look. J D
[01:54:00] Sports
[01:54:03] JD.L.
[01:54:20] margins have come in quite a bit.
[01:54:22] something. This kind of decline in
[01:54:25] return on capital looks like uh they
[01:54:28] probably did a dumb acquisition.
[01:54:31] L
[01:54:37] I I just don't like retailers. I know
[01:54:38] you're telling me here they've got this
[01:54:40] uh exclusive rights with Nike, yada
[01:54:43] yada. It it'll probably be okay. I I
[01:54:46] this is not I I I don't like this type
[01:54:48] of business even though it probably
[01:54:50] works as a trade. But thank you for
[01:54:51] sending in Daniel Borman. Uh, Valaris V
[01:54:55] A L.
[01:55:07] Someone is out promoting the hell out of
[01:55:09] this stock because I get it like every
[01:55:11] single week. Someone asking me about
[01:55:15] Valaris.
[01:55:18] All right. So, it's just turned from
[01:55:19] negative free cash flow. It's been
[01:55:21] negative free cash flow for six years.
[01:55:23] Now, they got like two cents of margins
[01:55:26] are recovering. So, it looks like it's
[01:55:28] trying to recover. What do they do
[01:55:31] for a living here? Dashboard.
[01:55:44] Offshore drilling.
[01:55:48] No, I don't like that business. I'm
[01:55:49] going to I I I would be more inclined if
[01:55:52] you have to buy something in the
[01:55:54] services by Slumber or Hallebertton.
[01:55:57] Since I don't have to, I'm not I've done
[01:55:59] zero. Um
[01:56:03] Eric is talking about global liquidity.
[01:56:05] I'm just looking at global M2 money
[01:56:08] supply on that front. And then you start
[01:56:10] to look at rate cuts and uh Fed actions
[01:56:12] globally. Uh, how's it
[01:56:16] LVMH reaching levels
[01:56:20] worth considering? I think we covered
[01:56:22] LVMH like a month ago and I said it was
[01:56:24] fine. It's just not for me.
[01:56:28] I mean, this is a quality compounder. I
[01:56:31] uh it's just
[01:56:34] this is the type of business you buy if
[01:56:36] you have permanent capital. if you have
[01:56:38] to perform for your owner for your
[01:56:40] investors on a annual basis uh I think
[01:56:44] there are higher and better uses of
[01:56:45] capital but this one will be fine and
[01:56:47] you'll continue to compound your capital
[01:56:49] at double digits over time big play on
[01:56:52] the China recovery we have enough
[01:56:53] exposure to that with Alibaba but
[01:56:55] generally a great company and probably
[01:56:57] at a good price uh Denise
[01:57:02] there got that already Chris Booker
[01:57:06] Vic Trex. V I C T R E X.
[01:57:13] V I C T R E X.
[01:57:26] Yeah, there's no sign of margin recovery
[01:57:28] yet. What do these guys do?
[01:57:41] Okay. Polymer solutions VCT
[01:57:55] H. This one might be interesting.
[01:57:59] Polymer solutions.
[01:58:06] High performance polymer.
[01:58:12] High performance
[01:58:21] energy seals. Applications in cars,
[01:58:24] medical,
[01:58:26] industrial,
[01:58:29] electronics.
[01:58:32] Yeah. Um,
[01:58:48] take a look at the balance sheet.
[01:58:56] It's a tiny business.
[01:58:59] Maybe 2 million
[01:59:02] four. That's okay.
[01:59:17] Free cash flow is okay.
[01:59:21] I just, you know, I think you got to
[01:59:22] listen to four or eight calls. Like, how
[01:59:24] are they going to turn around the top
[01:59:25] line?
[01:59:28] Um, seems like a pretty stale business
[01:59:30] that probably has a small little niche.
[01:59:38] Share counts. Okay.
[01:59:40] VCT
[01:59:59] Chris, if you can get confidence that
[02:00:02] they can turn the top line and uh
[02:00:07] I do like these business a lot of the
[02:00:09] chemical related businesses have been
[02:00:11] left for dead. I I like this area. I
[02:00:13] think it's going to start to recover.
[02:00:16] I think it's interesting, but you got to
[02:00:18] get you got to understand their moat and
[02:00:20] you got to understand the turnaround
[02:00:22] plan. And the only way you can do that
[02:00:23] is doing the work with all the calls. I'
[02:00:25] I'd listen to the last eight conference
[02:00:27] calls. What did they say they were going
[02:00:29] to do? What did they actually do? Are
[02:00:30] they on track? Are they off track? And
[02:00:33] kind of take it from there. But I
[02:00:34] generally think that one is interesting.
[02:00:38] Uh, okay. So, this guy had sent me Jaz
[02:00:43] Rube had sent me uh
[02:00:48] Allegiance. I I don't I don't think I I
[02:00:52] like this one. Um,
[02:00:56] ALGT
[02:01:02] pro it's like a second tier carrier. I
[02:01:05] mean, it probably trades it's probably a
[02:01:08] great trade, but I'd almost rather just
[02:01:11] buy jets. So, yeah, there's they're
[02:01:13] starting to inflect.
[02:01:17] Let's see.
[02:01:23] I I think when you're in such a crappy
[02:01:25] industry that's beaten down so much,
[02:01:27] just pick a higher quality name like
[02:01:29] this. This could work, but if if the
[02:01:32] recovery gets delayed, this is going to
[02:01:33] be the one that's hurt the most. So,
[02:01:37] I don't know.
[02:01:39] I'd probably be more inclined to take
[02:01:44] I don't like the space, but I think
[02:01:45] you're right from a trading perspective.
[02:01:47] So, kudos to you. Uh, other than that, I
[02:01:52] think,
[02:01:54] see, that's a client uh request. We're
[02:01:57] all set. We'll be back next week, same
[02:01:59] time, probably a day early. In the
[02:02:02] meantime, make it a great one. Bye for
[02:02:05] now.
