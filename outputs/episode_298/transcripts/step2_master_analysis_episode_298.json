He believes the Trump budget bill will spur massive growth and that Powell is not the right guy for the job. He is also very positive on the consumer and discretionary stocks, especially those that have been left for dead. He sees a rotation out of mega cap stocks and into smaller buys. He also likes turnarounds and dividend aristocrats. He is particularly bullish on Canada Goose and believes it is a generational opportunity. He also added Etsy as a new position.",
