  "cleaned_transcript": "And then let's get down to the media. So, first and foremost, I want to uh introduce you to Andrew Keys. He is the founder and uh co-founder and the chairman of the Ether Machine, the ticker DY NX. \n### FEATURED_COMPANY_DEEP_DIVES\nYou'll see all the full disclosures at the beginning of this and uh we'll go into it. And this is kind of not what we normally cover on the podcast, but I do think that understanding what's going on with this technology is extremely valuable. So, we made an exception. And what I thought would be a 10 to 15 minute segment uh turned out to be more. And it turned out to be more because the information that Andrew was sharing was so incredibly valuable in terms of a a peak into the future and comparing it to the past kind of the advent of the internet and other aspects. So I think this is going to be helpful for you just in terms of general knowledge. So uh listen in here to welcome everyone. We have an ex extremely special guest today. the co-founder and chairman of the Ether Machine, my friend Andrew Keys. And we have to do a bunch of full disclosure here, Andrew. Uh first off, uh we became friends on the golf course. I was invited to speak at a family office conference in Puerto Rico and you have a place down in in Dorado. And I I remember telling the host uh they're like, \"What do you need? We'll pay your full freight.\" I was like, \"Look, I'll go down there and do this thing on one condition.\" They're like, \"What's that?\" I was like, \"I want to play Dorado.\" And uh so it was I had to fly down on Sunday. And I remember texting the guy on Saturday like, \"Where's my tea time? I'm not getting on a plane without my tea time.\" So uh so apparently he hit a text chain. Andrew said, \"I'll take this guy out.\" And we click because uh for a number of reasons. Number one, just generally liked each other, but two, we grew up in New Jersey, fellow Jersey guys, a few towns away from each other. Three, golf addicts, although I think I probably shot a 95 the first time we played together. And that's that's my lititness test because if someone invites me back to play after I embarrass myself, I know we're going to be great friends. Um, and then uh over time, this has gone back a few couple few years now, uh, you became a client of Great Hill Capital, which I'm very grateful and it wasn't just a one-off, uh, you've regularly added added funds and, uh, we're extremely grateful for that. And uh in full disclosure, I became an investor in the private placement of the Ether machine, which I'm very excited about. And you have to know from my podcast, Hedge Fund Tips with Tom Hayes, I'm going to get a lot of blowback because they're going to say, \"Wait, don't you buy companies that make hammers and building supplies and generators and airplanes?\" And the answer is yes. This would be something kind of outside the mandate of what we do. But it's so interesting and one of the key tenants of how I invest is I bet on the jockey. So this is an area that I know absolutely nothing. I mean I know enough to get myself in trouble, but I I'm not an expert in, but I wanted to participate and I want that to be fully disclosed before we talk about this because I think this is going to be extremely helpful. It's extremely timely and people are going to want to know about it and then choose to do whatever they want with this information. But not to have it at this point in history, I think is probably uh a mistake for a lot of people. So, uh wi\n\nAnd uh in full disclosure, I became an investor in the private placement of the Ether machine, which I'm very excited about.

It's extremely timely and people are going to want to know about it and then choose to do whatever they want with this information. But not to have it at this point in history, I think is probably uh a mistake for a lot of people. So, uh wi\n\nAndrew, um why don't you just share with our audience a little bit about your background before Ethereum because you know, we meet a lot of people who have become very successful in the crypto space and it was just kind of like they bought something and it went up and like here they are, they're successful. You were an extremely successful businessman before crypto. So, so talk to the audience a little bit about that. >> Well, well, I'm still trying to figure out what I want to do when I grow up. So, you know, it's an evolution. Well, first and foremost, thank you for having me, Tom. Uh, it's a pleasure uh to do this with you, and I I appreciate the time you're spending with me. So long story short, I sat at the intersection of the capital markets and technology for about two decades and and and and most prior to Ethereum, I built a revenue cycle management company in the healthc care space. So, simply put, when you went to the doctor's office and you handed your insurance card and your driver's license to the person at the front desk, that information would get put into an electronic medical record and sent to Chennai, India, where uh that information would be shared with Blue Cross Blue Shield United Healthcare that's also in Chennai, India. and your demographics uh and your medical record would basically be approved for payment by a doctor. So basically we managed the revenue cycle management of health care providers and I basically learned everything that was uh wrong with payments and billing and insurance within a very specific vertical of healthcare. >> And this happened kind of at the same time Bitcoin happened. And simply put, Bitcoin has been this interesting experiment in monetary theory. And there's one asset on the Bitcoin blockchain, a Bitcoin, and it can do one thing, which is to send. And uh I thought well that that that that's cool that I can send you a bitcoin without a bank in the middle but there needs to be a much more sophisticated logic that underlies a transaction because the world's more sophisticated. You know, in my health care experience, you would have a medical doctor who was the provider that would have a procedure done on a patient based on a diagnosis. So you had if patient has healthc care insurance and premium has been paid and patient has diagnosis that substantiates a procedure, then the doctor gets paid. So simply put, I I use this as kind of a a a a sector specific example. You had these if then else statements and really that it was the aha moment for me of Ethereum over Bitcoin. And and Bitcoin was this opening act where there was one asset on it with one function, a Bitcoin being sent like a global abacus. But with Ethereum, we can tokenize any asset, a barrel of oil, a US dollar, a bar of gold, a a a parcel of real estate, and then we can embed those assets into digital legal agreements. These if then else statements where our agreements are going from Microsoft Word documents into software code, these if then else statements called smart contracts, >> right? and and and basically I helped build the largest software company in the Ethereum ecosystem, a company called Consensus. Uh and uh after that I created a commodity pool operator and commodity trading advisor registered with the CFTC named Dharma, which is an acronym for digital asset risk management advisors. >> Okay. >> Uh that managed institutional scale of Ethereum. >> Wow. Okay. So you you have this healthcare business, you you sell that, you get a liquidity event >> and then you start up uh consensus which is uh doing this programming and that's how you come to to be involved with Ethereum. >> Uh do you meet the other players in Ethereum? You program some of this. What's going through your mind at the time? Do you do you buy the coin itself or you're just involved in the development? Tell tell us a little bit about that. >> Do all of the above. >> Okay. Uh so so so I went literally like a nerd to a meetup.com meetup which was the first ever Ethereum meetup in Manhattan >> uh at Cardoo Law School uh which was was held by a a joint technologist and lawyer uh who was a professor uh named Aaron Wright who's very prominent in the Ethereum ecosystem to to this day and and he was hosting uh Joseph Luben who was one of the co-founders of the Ethereum project and and and basically we had this discussion about you know what would the internet look like what would the world look like if we kind of took the peer-to-peer nature of Bitcoin but created the ability to have any asset tokenized and we could have a decentralized applications so you could have kind of Uber without Uber sitting in the middle you could have a smart contract that sits in the middle between a passenger and a driver and you could have uh an insurer that that that creates a micro insurance policy just for that ride and and and basically what would be the world uh if if that were to occur. >> Okay. >> And so so I helped build this company called consensus. I helped Vitalic Bdderin who is really kind of the chief architect of Ethereum uh explain it to lay people because he's a very technical person and very gifted uh and and really kind of one of the fun stories because we just came upon the 10-year anniversary of Ethereum. Uh the first time Ethereum Ether crossed $1, uh it's now $3,500 I believe or $3,700 today. Uh was when we created I I I put a permissioned version of Ethereum on top of Azure, which is Microsoft's cloud and and basically created a concept of blockchain as a service where institutions like JP Morgan, Microsoft, etc. could tokenize an asset. They could create a digital token that represented a stock, a bond, a security, uh, and then could move those tokens and kind of, uh, expedite their trade settlement, uh, embed logic that says you can only move these assets if certain conditions occur. And basically, we released that news on the Wall Street Journal and Ether crossed $1. >> Wow. Wow. Okay. So explain because you you probably have a sense in my audience. I know you've tuned into the podcast from time to time. Explain Ethereum like you would to a 10-year-old. So you me many people including me uh don't in my audience don't have the expertise or or understanding in crypto or blockchain. And in Puerto Rico after we played, I remember sitting over breakfast. Uh you explained to me how it parallels the internet in the '9s as this platform and then all these apps were built upon the platform that became public companies in their own right. Apps meaning Amazon.com, Netscape, Google was an app built on the internet platform. All these pub codes, billions and trillions of dollars built on one platform. And you explained Ethereum to me like it's the next platform and there will be apps built on Ethereum that be go on to become huge public companies in itself. And that kind of clicked for me. I'm like this is not just a coin where I'm hoping someone comes in behind me and pays more money for it. There's something unique and special here that I still don't understand but this guy figured it out. uh can you explain it to my audience in a similar way that you explained it to me because that blew my mind. >> Sure. So, so it's interesting uh context because the way we'll explain it today uh is very reminiscent of thinking about, you know, Amazon as a book seller, you know, 20 years ago. Yeah. >> And and basically what what what I'd say is that I believe Ethereum to be the next generation of the internet. >> Wow. >> And t\n\n institutions like JP Morgan, Microsoft, etc. could tokenize an asset.

So, so it's interesting uh context because the way we'll explain it today uh is very reminiscent of thinking about, you know, Amazon as a book seller, you know, 20 years ago. Yeah. >> And and basically what what I'd say is that I believe Ethereum to be the next generation of the internet. >> Wow. >> And t\n\nbasically, we're evolving the internet from from from a place where 25 years ago, we could basically read on the internet. And then with social media, we could read and write. And now with this next generation of the internet, we're able to read, write, and own. And that ownership is what Ethereum enables. And what that means is that we are going to have natively digital assets. All assets going forward are going to be represented as digital tokens. And these digital tokens can be anything from a stock, a bond, a derivative, a borrower of gold like a commodity, a barrel of oil, intellectual property like art or music. And we can have logic uh that's embedded inside these these assets. So imagine you and I are a rock band and and you're you're the singer and I'm and I'm the bass player. Uh and it's just a twoerson rock band. It's not very fun rock band, but but you're the good-looking guy and and I'm the ugly guy. and and and so basically we could have our own website and every time we sell a song peer-to-peer with somebody else uh for a dollar, we could embed in this token that represents our song uh payment splits that that that says every time the song someone pays a dollar because you're the good-looking guy, you get 75% and I'm the ugly bass player, I get 25. So, we're able to kind of embed logic into these assets and and and with that, what we're going to see is an expedited velocity of money where we're going to be able to see kind of constructs we've never never been able to see before. A an employment contract that gets paid by the minute, a a real estate investment trust that could have 40,000 investors that can deploy capital. you know w within days uh in and and add arbitrarily complex logic you know to take that you know that that example further uh you know we had this asset that was a song where we we had the 7525 split now let's just take the same concept and turn it into a token that was a deed of a home so if you and I own a house >> and we have a mortgage on it that costs $1,000 and we wanted to rent the house uh to somebody else that would pay us $2,000 a month. We could have this this deed have a wallet and every time the rent was paid to the wallet, we could have autonomous splits that says a th000 gets paid to the mortgage and then of the remaining thousand 75 could get paid to Tom and 25% could get paid to me. So basically what we're seeing is kind of the intelligence of our assets uh and and and and so this is what Ethereum enables. >> Wow. So will will the companies built upon on top of this will they be the companies that enable simple people like me to you know I go into this app that's built on Ethereum and I say uh here I'm uploading the asset which is the digital song and when people buy it you know send you know $1,000 to Bank of America send 2,000 to Andrew and it will do it automatically. So companies that facilitate the use of that uh or other type of companies built on Ethereum like the country the companies that do the the contracts and and do the deeds and do the title insurance and do that type of stuff. >> So what you as a user that's let's call it not a computer scientist should >> is that you you basically should have the same user experience that we have now with let's call it the legacy internet. >> Okay. should see a thinning of the intermediary layer. >> So basically there should be a basically a value uh price discovery mechanism for the value of intermediation between counterparties of a transaction and to to to that point you'll see different uh players uh create different things. So like what you what you kind of referenced was yes there'll be like web designers and web developers that will make applications but then there'll be just complete enduser apps that that that we'll be able to enjoy. And I think the kind of the first one that we can reference is circle CRCL. >> Yeah. >> Uh just went public. Uh and and basically what this is is the is the adoption of stable coins which I would say is kind of like the first real product market fit of Ethereum. and and and and what you're starting to see right now is when when people go online to purchase things, they can pay with their American Express, Visa, Mastercard, or there's a button that says pay with a stable coin and the cost is 3% less because you don't have the credit card processing. >> Wow. >> Basically, you're just seeing a thinning of the price discovery mechanism for a payment processor. So it removes the friction and circle which I I don't know what the market cap is today. I'm assuming tens of billions of dollars already. So this is a an example of a public company that would not exist if not for the new quote unquote internet platform which is called Ethereum. That that that billions of dollars of of equity creation uh is non-existent. Uh son's >> Ethereum. >> Ethereum. >> Yeah. Yeah. So, so, so the there's very good data available uh and and it's and it's by a financial accounting standards uh bard the FASB uh deems highquality liquid assets. So, things like dollars, stocks, bonds. So, these are examples of HQLA highquality liquid assets and there are about $250 billion of highquality liquid assets which is still very small. Yeah, >> but this kind of shows you where we are in terms of kind of the adoption life cycle. And there's $250 billion of highquality liquid assets on blockchains. And 90% of those highquality liquid assets are settled on Ethereum. And and and basically these are kind of powerless dynamics uh that I would akin to Google uh where 90% plus of searches happen on Google and then ask Jeieves gets you know onetenth 1% Bing gets onetenth of 1%. Well, I Tom, when was the last time you used Yahoo? >> Yeah. >> Uh and and so and so what we're seeing and and and there are technical reasons why Ethereum has this uh this kind of hegemonic position. uh Ethereum has been able to create standards uh where where basically anybody whether they're a developer in Mumbai or Paris or San Francisco can create a token based upon a token standard and that token can go into a wallet. So so basically there's the ability for any engineer to kind of standardize these assets and that's created a a large adoption. There's also kind of robustness of the technology. So, so basically there's multiple implementations of Ethereum. So, there's nine different ones that that have to form consensus and agree. So, basically it it can't go down. And then there's decentralization of of the Ethereum network, which is the most decentralized uh protocol on earth uh for for this type of throughput. Um so so basically there are a few different reasons why it's kind of become hegemonic. >> So it's almost like a network effect because 90% of these assets are on it everyone else has to be on it and it just creates this cyclical uh effect. The other thing you mentioned about decentralization I guess was one of the\n\navailable uh and and it's and it's by a financial accounting standards uh bard the FASB uh deems highquality liquid assets. So, things like dollars, stocks, bonds. So, these are examples of HQLA highquality liquid assets and there are about $250 billion of highquality liquid assets which is still very small. Yeah, >> but this kind of shows you where we are in terms of kind of the adoption life cycle. And there's $250 billion of highquality liquid assets on blockchains.

And and and basically these are kind of powerless dynamics uh that I would akin to Google uh where 90% plus of searches happen on Google and then ask Jeieves gets you know onetenth 1% Bing gets onetenth of 1%. Well, I Tom, when was the last time you used Yahoo? >> Yeah. >> Uh and and so and so what we're seeing and and there are technical reasons why Ethereum has this uh this kind of hegemonic position. uh Ethereum has been able to create standards uh where where basically anybody whether they're a developer in Mumbai or Paris or San Francisco can create a token based upon a token standard and that token can go into a wallet.

Um so so basically there are a few different reasons why it's kind of become hegemonic. >> So it's almost like a network effect because 90% of these assets are on it everyone else has to be on it and it just creates this cyclical uh effect. The other thing you mentioned about decentralization I guess was one of the questions  I was going to ask. You know again not a computer scientist so this can't be hacked because of the level of decentralization and that you'd have to hack like a gazillion computers at the same time or something >> right. So, so to your point, liquidity begets liquidity, you know, to your to your prior point. And secondarily to uh this is the only way that kind of nation states can can trustlessly interact, you know, at that like size and scale because t\n\n### MISCELLANEOUS\nquestions  I was going to ask. You know again not a computer scientist so this can't be hacked because of the level of decentralization and that you'd have to hack like a gazillion computers at the same time or something >> right. So, so to your point, liquidity begets liquidity, you know, to your to your prior point. And secondarily to uh this is the only way that kind of nation states can can trustlessly interact, you know, at that like size and scale because t\n\nhere is this multiclient diversity. \n### QUOTES_OF_THE_WEEK\nSo, so Bitcoin has one asset on it, a Bitcoin, and it has one function, which is to send. And if we're talking, you know, to an investor base about TAM, there's a total addressable market of what I would call gold, which is kind of 22 trillion. Uh, and Ethereum is the next generation of the internet where we can digitize any asset. So you can have literally any asset you can think of, we can create a digit natively digital version of it. And then we can do anything with it. So instead of just send, we can create these arbitrarily complex logic statements called smart contracts, which you can just kind of think of as digital if then else statements that can create infinite applications. So you could create decentralized Airbnb, decentralized Uber, decentralized Amazon, decentralized so anything. And basically what we're attempting to do is creating a price discovery mechanism for the value of intermediation. And and and the first example of this that that's hit product market fit is stable coins. uh and and because Ethereum settles over 85% of all stable coins uh and the there was just the Genius Act that passed two weeks ago which gave clarity to stable coin regulation. the largest beneficiary of the Genius Act is Ethereum and and so and and so basically t\n\n### MEDIA_APPEARANCE_RECAP\nBitcoin has one asset on it, a Bitcoin, and it has one function, which is to send. And if we're talking, you know, to an investor base about TAM, there's a total addressable market of what I would call gold, which is kind of 22 trillion. Uh, and Ethereum is the next generation of the internet where we can digitize any asset. So you can have literally any asset you can think of, we can create a digit natively digital version of it. And then we can do anything with it. So instead of just send, we can create these arbitrarily complex logic statements called smart contracts, which you can just kind of think of as digital if then else statements that can create infinite applications. So you could create decentralized Airbnb, decentralized Uber, decentralized Amazon, decentral so anything. And basically what we're attempting to do is creating a price discovery mechanism for the value of intermediation. And and and the first example of this that that's hit product market fit is stable coins. uh and and because Ethereum settles over 85% of all stable coins uh and the there was just the Genius Act that passed two weeks ago which gave clarity to stable coin regulation. the largest beneficiary of the Genius Act is Ethereum and and and so and and so basically t\n\nwhat I think is that Bitcoin was this great opening act of of kind of teaching us that I could send you value like on a global abacus and I can send you the bead but basically we can only send the bead back and forth to each other whereas with Ethereum we can create any asset on it and then create any type of uh digital legal agreement. I mean my general instinct was always with Bitcoin and and it's basically been wrong uh was that with Bitcoin you're just waiting for someone to bid it up further. Uh and it's and it's worked. Uh but but my view was like yeah it's scarce but there could be other just send type of instruments created. Whereas with Ethereum now you have this kind of flywheel and literally practical daily uh actions and contracts and and tokenizations are happening on it. Therefore there's real intrinsic value and speaking to my next kind of question is how are banks responding to the advent of Ethereum and how does that play moving forward? So, so I think it's notable to to recognize uh not a bank, but I would call it like early fast movers or competitors to bank. So, so I would I would raise Coinbase, Robin Hood, Kraken that's going to IPO in in Q1 of 2026. Um these are I would say kind of like hybrid exchanges uh kind of like fintexs that that also have crypto or crypto that have fintech uh aspirations. And basically each one of those um has created what's called a layer 2 scaling solution that settles to Ethereum. So Coinbase has created BAS. Robin Hood just created tokenized shares and they didn't name it, but basically it's a layer 2 scaling solution that settles to Ethereum. Kraken has created Inc. which is another layer 2 scaling solution that settles to Ethereum. And so what what we've seen is that kind of the fast movers that don't have kind of like the incumbent debt of being a systemically important bank over the last 20 50 100 years uh like the bold brackets are able to kind of move very quickly and with the Genius Act passage uh literally only two weeks ago we are in like a very interesting Cambrian explosion moment. I foresee that each one of these banks will likely a create their own stable coin. B create their own wallet. Uh JP Morgan just announced that they're going to basically work with, you know, their client Coinbase so that when you log into your Chase account, you can basically access uh your crypto assets that are sitting on Coinbase. uh and and and and so you're going to have this wallet, these stable coins, and and you're going to have kind of a seamless user experience where kind of the pipes blur. Tell me, uh I I I got to ask one self-interest question, then I want to get to the Ether machine. Um so, one of our holdings is we own PayPal. uh do you know and PayPal is with Andrew Chris he's Alex Chris is trying to be uh innovative and you see to your point like you could send stable coins you could pay with crypto they're the sixth largest issuer of stable coins so they're they're kind of on the cutting edge of this how will they be helped or hurt by these developments uh in your view well so I I think that PayPal is interesting in the sense that you you nailed it that they have been one of the first movers they have a top 10 uh stable coin Uh that said, you know, their business is to kind of sit as an intermediary between, you know, counterparties. Yeah. uh you know what you know I I kind of gave like the technical devil's advocate or proponent to uh you know the thinning of the intermediary layer but there are there are kind of fundamental ad values that a company like PayPal has like let's call it like the govern uh the global regulatory compliance that they have you know in you know a 100 different jurisdictions uh like that money transmission business I think is is something that that they're going to have kind of incumbent upon them. But I think that you're going to you're going to see a thinning. PayPal, Mastercard, Ammex, you know, where where you're able to do this and basically the AML KYC is going to be done uh at the identity layer instead of at the intermediary layer. So basically, in order to transact, you're going to have to have your wallet that that is the Tom wallet, not the PayPal wallet, and KYC approved. And and and basically, you'll have to have attributes about yourself. So facts about yourself. Maybe it's your uh bank statement or or your mortgage that that that deems exactly where you live for AMLKYC. And then like attributes about yourself or excuse me, attestations about yourself. to like your reputation, you know, does Tom have good credit? Does is Tom good in different transactions? And then you're going to have this self-s sovereign digital identity where it's owned by the individual rather than owned by the intermediary. So, you know, a good example of this is if you take 10,000 Ubers and you get five stars because you're a gentleman and you want to go rent an Airbnb, that reputation of your 10,000 five-star uh transactions is not portable. And I bet if you take 10,000 nice Ubers, uh when you go to rent uh your Airbnb, you'd probably be a pretty good tenant of the house. But that reputational attribute doesn't kind of sit with you. So what we're going to see is is is this technology creates a self-s sovereign based internet rather than logging into Facebook or logging into PayPal or logging into the these other apps. um we're going to start seeing the user have more uh sovereignty and and power. So I I think the way to think about it and correct me if I'm wrong is like the PayPal that have networks of 438 million people in the short term they're going to benefit from this transition in that they're the first mover and that if I want to pay for something with stablecoin or or or crypto or whatever it's it's there. So for like the next three years they're going to be like the innovator. when we look four or five years out that mar they're gonna have margin compression as as they're whittleled away and by then we'll be out at a double. So uh on to the All right now to the Ethereum machine why we're here. Explain why you set it up, how you set up and uh what what what it does and what it can become. Great. So with with uh before explaining the Ether machine, we have to just kind of touch on a little aspect to Ether the asset. So, so we talked about Ethereum, this next generation substrate of the internet and and basically for every computational step, it requires a micro payment of a digital oil or digital fuel called ether. And and and part of this is that uh with Bitcoin, the way that uh the network is secured is through what's called proof of work, which simply put is actors have to spend money on real estate, hardware, and electricity to solve math problems to basically validate transactions. So basically, if if you wanted to be a Bitcoin miner, you would have to spend money on hardware, real estate, and electricity, and then you could solve math problems and and then get rewarded in Bitcoin. Ethereum works a little bit differently. Uh, and it works through what's called proof of stake. And and what this does is Ethereum doesn't need hardware, real estate, and electricity, but you one needs a stake or or or basically to post a bond. and then to validate a transaction and this is kind of a technical uh feat uh and and then they are generated in yield in ether. So where bitcoin is kind of unproductive this digital gold asset ether is productive a in the sense that one needs it like oil for these transactions and two in the sense that it can generate its own intrinsic yield. when when when when going through you know how does a public market ex uh participant that's not necessarily a computer scientist get exposure to this asset there are different kind of thought processes that one could think about so first and foremost there are ETFs and right now in America uh and it's mostly a relic of the gensler era uh the ETFs do not have the yield that Ether generates through proof of stake and that's like basically buying a stock that has a dividend but not availing yourself to the dividend. Wow. We do think that uh in time they will have the ability to stake but if we look at the ETPs in Canada or Europe as a proxy what we're seeing is that the ETPs can only stake at 50% capacity. M so that means if you have a billion dollars in a Canadian ETP they're only staking 50% which is 500 million and on that they're only earning what I would call the vanilla yield which is basically kind of the floor uh yield which is about 3% on half of the assets. So it's really on the billion dollars you're earning one and a half percent. Right? And with with this vehicle we're able to and the reason why that happens is it's a technical nuance and without boring everybody if one were to unstake their ether today it would take a couple days uh to to get one's ether back. But if, god forbid, a black swan event were to happen in the world and 50% of stakers wanted to unstake at the same time. Yeah. Couple days would grow from to 6 months or a year. Yeah. And and and so that doesn't jive well with the 24-hour redemption requirements of ETPs, ETFs. And so the and and this is uh denominated in Ether. It's not even dollar denominated. So you can't like underwrite this or insure it or market make it. You just basically can only stake at 50% capacity. So first and foremost in the ETFs you would basically be staking at 50% capacity. Yeah. And there are other things that we can do and that's really kind of one of three buckets of active management of this asset which is so the first is staking and then the next is what's called reststaking where you can use Ethereum's proofofstake protocol and to and use it to secure other networks and we could add additional yield that way. And then there's this decentralized financial economy that's been put on top of Ethereum. this $250 billion uh economy that will be growing to trillions. Yeah. Over the next uh decades and you can use ether as let's call it pristine collateral and you can earn additional yield there. So where where the ETFs back of the napkin are earning you know 1 and a half% we believe we can materially outperform uh that by employing active risk management. And so we think that this is the right vehicle, a public operating company is the right vehicle to actively manage Ether. And then there's kind of kind of two paths to go by. One could deploy into a shell company, which is done via reverse takeover, or the vehicle we chose, which is a spec. Uh so and and so simply put, I I anchored this vehicle with my own uh personal balance sheet and and I'm deploying $645 million of Ether into this uh because I wouldn't suggest anyone else do something that I'm not willing to do myself and I want to lead by example. That's about 15 times uh any other uh vehicle in in the space in terms of a a founders's commitment. Wow. So, so all these other guys that that are in the same space but not able to generate the same yield that you've been doing at Dharma, by the way, it's not like you're like, \"Oh, I have this idea how we can get more yield.\" You've actually been doing it for years with your own capital and now you're deploying and 600 million sounds like an enormous amount of money, but it's a minority for for you. I mean, but it's material. Uh, and that's that's a critical thing that I look for in management. What what skin do they have in the in the game? And number one, I co-invested because I I like you and we're friends and I'm betting on the jockey. But two, it's like he's putting a real I mean significant amount of money in his own idea. Um uh so so so talk a little bit about how that differentiates you from the other uh players in it and then um we we can talk about how people can find it and and learn more. Yeah. So, so simply put, I started looking at this from first principles and I said if I wanted to deploy capital, so so I was already doing this in a private context, but basically the the difference is now in a public vehicle, I'm able to access the public equity markets and the public debt markets, right? Yeah. Could basically borrow to to acquire more ether or I could sell equity to acquire more ether. And when I started looking at it, there was, you know, generally speaking, two ways to do this. One would be I could reverse take over a dying pick your poison, a dying biotech, a dying gambling company, a dying Bitcoin miner, you know, some dying micro cap that had a pre-existing operating business, uh, pre-existing liabilities, pre-existing management that I would still have to pay, uh, you know, all of that. you know, I wanted pure play exposure to Ethereum and and and to be able to choose my operating team uh and and and solely focus on that. I didn't want to have a shadow management team, shadow liabilities, shadow debts, uh and and have 80% exposure to Ethereum and 20% to this pre-existing operating business. Um and and and so we went down the route of creating a denovo entity. So a brand new LLC where we've anchored with capital uh and and then basically that will go through a business combination uh with the uh with a special purpose acquisition company that has no pre-existing operating company uh to to deal with. And then basically this is the sole pure play exposure to Ethereum and Etherdenominated yield where we have chosen handpicked our management team wi-i which are essentially the avengers of Ethereum you know the best-in-class operators uh to to to actively manage this risk for institutional and mainstream investors and and we just completed uh a capital raise in in the form of a private placement and a pipe. Yeah. It is the largest common equity uh raise uh in the last five years. So over $1.5 billion and and the market has agreed with us and and so now um the the the there's exposure available through the ticker Dynx. Okay. Which is Dynamics uh Corporation. Um and and that is going to uh we are going through the SC uh SEC S4 registration right now and and and basically in a couple months uh that will evolve into the Ether Machine Inc. and and and and we will have an active operating business of acquiring and professionally managing Ether. That's amazing. And and if you look at uh Micro Strategy as an example, you know, Ether, Ethereum is still scarce, right? Like Bitcoin. So So there's that. Um he's been able to in the Micro Strategy vehicle, which he still has the operating company, but whatever. Issue a lot of lowcost debt and converts to buy up more of this scarce resource that only has that one value you said of send, whereas yours has unlimited values of banks and stable coins. And you know I I look at stable coins because it's going from 250 billion to two trillion demand which is going to lower rates which helps my housing plays. So I I think of it in a different thing but it's going to help demand for treasuries. It's also going to be uh the productivity is going to be deflationary and all all that taking the friction out increasing the velocity like what you said. Um so so I think of it in that that term. Are you guys thinking in the scheme of what Michael Sailor is doing or maybe like a more conservative version of that to accumulate at the right times and the right prices? So like you can issue equity. Let's say if you know Ethereum doubles in two months and you say, \"Ah, this is a little ahead of itself. Now's the time to issue equity.\" Or if if if capital's cheap, rates go down, let's issue debt because that makes sense. H how do you guys think about that? So So great question. What what I'd say is that broadly speaking, MSTR pioneered what I would consider a positive sum game where they were able to issue convertible debt to hedge funds acquiring volatility and they would basically use that convertible debt or or or the proceeds of that to buy the underlying asset in their case Bitcoin for shareholders that wanted Bitcoin exposure leveraged. Yeah. And and and I think that, you know, the devil's in the details and t\n\nthat will evolve into the Ether Machine Inc. and and and and we will have an active operating business of acquiring and professionally managing Ether. >> That's amazing.

Y >> and to your uh to to your equity part of the equation uh I think that one needs to understand that these assets can trade at a multiple nav or an MNAV >> and and uh Micro Strategy just recently came out and said that if t\n\n actively manage risk around the public debt markets efficiently. \n### FEATURED_COMPANY_DEEP_DIVES\nMicro Strategy just recently came out and said that if there is  a MNAV of the Micro Strategy stock that's greater than four they would aggressively sell equity. If it's between two and a half to four, they would opportunistically sell equity. If it's under two and a half times, they would not sell equity because that gets to a point where it starts being dilutive to shareholders rather than accreative. And we we will be similarly opportunistic. And my whole benchmark of this vehicle is Ether concentration per share. Meaning I will only a as patient zero as the largest shareholder as someone who wants to lead by example and not suggest anyone do something that I wouldn't do myself I will be maniacally focused on accreative ways to access the public equity and debt markets and it's market dependent\n\nhere is  a MNAV of the Micro Strategy stock that's greater than four they would aggressively sell equity. If it's between two and a half to four, they would opportunistically sell equity. If it's under two and a half times, they would not sell equity because that gets to a point where it starts being dilutive to shareholders rather than accreative. we will be relying more on the debt markets than the equity markets. Furthermore, this is another reason why we went with this denovo entity. So when you you have to underwrite you counterparties, let's call it the the hedge fund world, you know, let's AQR, Jane Street, Millennium, etc. that could be your convertible bond issuing counterparty. They're going to underwrite each one of these vehicles. And I think they'd rather underwrite something denovo with no legacy liabilities, no legacy operating companies, no legacy governance, um no legacy management team where you're going to have this kind of leakage. versus something that's clean. we think that for the let's call it medium to long term, this is the right vehicle to do so. the spread arbitrage. So in Bitcoin, you don't have that. What you have is a bet that people are going to pay you more for a scarce sendonly asset. Whereas in Ethereum, you're betting on the flywheel of more and more usage based on more stable coin, based on more applications, etc. But the three buckets that you talked about in terms of generating yield, it's very easy to it will be very easy at certain points in the marketplace to issue debt with a yield lower than a conservative yield you can generate on an ongoing basis. which implies if you're if you're maximizing a balance sheet, you you can be aggressive at certain points when the spread is wide because not issuing at th those points in time um would would would be bad for all shareholders, but namely you as the largest, right? Why wouldn't you take that spread all day long if the yield that you can generate is with con conservatism is meaningfully higher than what you pay for that debt, right? So, so, so you you absolutely nailed it. I mean, I think bit bottom line is this is a better treasury asset than Bitcoin due to the yield that could, you know, conceivably uh pay that zero coupon indefinitely. PS, it's double the V of Bitcoin. So, you know, so so there's another carrot in there for the VA seeking hedge funds um that are buying the convertible bonds. So, not only does it uh generate that yield, it has double the volatility. will you ever use this uh I guess never say never like as a as a birkure of Ethereum applications, meaning you got all this yield coming in, you got this appreciation, you have access to the capital markets. Would you ever look at like, hey, uh the next circle that's going to be a application on top of Ethereum and you're like, this is a slam dunk. We want to partic as the premier Ethereum reserve machine. We want to participate in that because we know that's going to be a five bagger or whatever. Do we take some of that yield and buy equity in some of these things on top of it or is that not in the immediate plans and open for discussion in the future kind of thing. So So what I would start with Well, first and foremost, we've got to start with getting the S4 registration done and getting us out the door, right?\n\nof generating yield, it's very easy to it will be very easy at certain points in the marketplace to issue debt with a yield lower than a conservative yield you can generate on an ongoing basis. which implies if you're if you're maximizing a balance sheet, you you can be aggressive at certain points when the spread is wide because not issuing at th those points in time um would would would be bad for all shareholders, but namely you as the largest, right?

So, you know, so so there's another carrot in there for the VA seeking hedge funds um that are buying the convertible bonds. So, not only does it uh generate that yield, it has double the volatility. >> And then last question, will you ever use this uh I guess never say never like as a as a birkure of Ethereum applications, meaning you got all this yield coming in, you got this appreciation, you have access to the capital markets. Would you ever look at like, hey, uh the next circle that's going to be a application on top of Ethereum and you're like, this is a slam dunk. We want to partic as the premier Ethereum reserve machine. Uh we want to participate in that because we know that's going to be a five bagger or whatever. Do we take some of that yield and buy equity in some of these things on top of it or is that not in the immediate plans and open for discussion in the future kind of thing. >> So So what I would start with >> Yeah. >> Well, first and foremost, we've got to start with getting the S4 registration done and getting us out the door, right? >> Yeah. Yeah. Of course. And and and with that said , afterwards, our CEO was the head of M&A for Consensus and basically was able to do 10 acquisitions in the last 5 years for Consensus, which is the largest software engineering shop in the Ethereum ecosystem with illlquid private company stock. Uh and now he's going to have public stock uh that we could do bolt-on acquisitions that we would deem cash flow accretive. >> Wow. And\n\n### FEATURED_COMPANY_DEEP_DIVES\nwith that said , we would start with ether generating yield accretive acquisitions potentially. And and so what I mean is that is, you know, there are custodians that we could acquire that get paid in Ether for custodying assets uh that we could use. There are staking companies that we could acquire that get paid in Ether for staking. And then as time evolves, uh, we could consider having, uh, other types of M&A that that that wouldn't necessarily be completely ether, uh, denominated, but could, you know, add to the enterprise value as the space matures. And I think that we there's kind of a crawl, walk, run, or a short, medium, long-term, however you want to kind of phrase or cliche of of of what this vehicle can be. And and I think that that'll be up to kind of market dependent and shareholder dependent and and and we're going to, you know, work with our shareholders on kind of the meritocratic best way forward.\n### MEDIA_APPEARANCE_RECAP\nAnd we're back. Uh and then I had the pleasure to join David Lynn. And I love joining David Lynn's show because his audience is so engaged. Uh every single time I've been on the last two, three years, I've been bullish. It tends to be a hard money. gold world is ending uh uh slant of an audience. Uh so they don't love when a bull comes on and and uh I get a kick out of the comments in the show notes when they criticize the hell out of me. And then David is so kind each time to say Tom's been right. Tom's been right. Tom's been right. And um uh we'll hope to keep that streak going. The early part of this is the normal Fed stuff which David likes to talk about which is kind of you know b boring at this point but useful in terms of understanding uh the calculations but the second half turned into something that I did not expect that it was which is where we aggressively dug into the framework and some aspects of my investing framework that maybe I haven't explained in such a clear way in the past. So, I think you're going to find this one valuable. Here we go. If he's right, he still has a leg a high level of disscent that you haven't seen since the early '9s. Two people dissenting him holding rates high. And if he's wrong, he's totally screwed because everyone knew he's too late Powell. The question is, will he or will he stay belligerent Powell and trying to uh kind of get back at the president? Well, you were right last year in calling for a cut before uh inflation reaches 2%. So, we're nowhere close to 2% still. In fact, it's gone up. What's then your outlook for the rest of the year? How many cuts are we getting? Thomas Hayes, managing member of Great Hill Capital, returns once more to the show. We'll be talking about his outlook for stock markets and uh his reaction to the latest uh news regarding um the uh jobs provisions on Friday as well as a new tariffs imposed last week. Welcome back to the show, Thomas. Good to see you. >> Thanks for having me, David. Great to be here. Initially, I wasn't really sure what the markets were reacting to last Friday afternoon. Was it the jobs revisions? Was it tariffs? Was it both? What do you think? I think that uh certainly the jobs look largest overall revision in 50 years. I mean, that's not just a, you know, a government rounding error that that's not even in the same ballpark. So, uh, what that did was it took us from a hawkish setup following the Fed meeting last week when everyone was like you couldn't believe how belligerent Powell was being uh uh regarding rate cuts. when you consider the the level of uh how restrictive he is right now and then you get this jobs report on Friday when it acknowledges oh my goodness the labor market is a lot weaker than anticipated so their dual mandate is back on the table uh which is very constructive and we're seeing already the odds of a September cut have moved up over 90% so that is going to change a lot of things and you started to see it even reflect ed uh yesterday uh with all the indices down except for one.

Here's um I I I want to get your reaction first and then um I want to show you uh Ray Dio's reaction on Twitter. He claims that uh he would have fired her too, but not for the same reasons. But um what is your general assessment of whether or not BLS data is useful as an investor or investment and or trading indicator? Yeah, I would say two two things. One, biggest revision, uh, two-month revision since 2013, multimonth revisions going back 50 years. So whether there was a political motivation or not a political motivation, I have no idea. That's speculation. But, uh, you know, if you're building a house and, you know, you're you're 4T off from where the the baseboard should go, uh, you've got a structural problem for years. So, she's just simply incompetent. she wasn't bringing in the right technology or the right people to uh narrow that margin of safety to get accurate data. So just simple incompetence was a uh good enough reason to fire her and and move on and get someone credibility credible in there that's going to take action to reform and update and upgrade uh the data collection and dissemination. So I I I think that's number one. The second part of your question, >> let's take a look at what uh Dallio said here. Uh I probably would have fired the head of the BLS2.

Well, if it's errorprone and obsolete, why are we using it as any sort of trading indicator at all? >> Well, one uh I don't use it I I I think this is in the in the scheme of short-term voting machine, long-term weighing machine. like these revisions eventually get it right. So if you're using it on a trading on a month-to-month or week- toeek basis, which we don't do, uh then yes, this data is really not helpful and potentially harmful to to your outlook. If you're an investor and you're looking at the free cash flow of a company and the revenue growth and the moat, uh it's completely meaningless because you will have after a few months the the correct numbers. Uh I think what Dallio is saying based on that article that you just posted is exactly what I'm saying. Something is is wrong regardless of the motivation you need someone to upgrade the systems and improve the data collection and dissemination. Uh and if there was any uh issue political bias etc that's another reason but that can't be proven at the moment and it's irrelevant. The key is the output is insufficient and not acceptable. >> Well, the bigger picture then on the jobs numbers, do um do the job numbers indicate any significant meaningful slowdown in uh employment activity thereby potentially lowering uh margins and weakening earnings for this quarter or next. Yeah, look, I think you know if you look at the revisions going back multi-months that was a period of significant uncertainty. So it might be the lagged effect cuz what you've seen since then is seuite confidence after liberation day was kind of resolved the market started to recover. uh you're seeing CEO confidence come back. As a matter of fact, last week was the biggest week in years for deal activity, M&A, uh etc. That the the uh investment bankers in the Hamptons aren't playing golf. They're busy on the phones in August, which is pretty unusual. So, animal spirits have come back. Uh, and I think that um it might be more of a rear view looking mirror phenomenon, but it's also a message to the Fed like, hey, you really are too restrictive and you really are too late because once the unemployment starts to tick up, it's very very hard to put that genie back in the bottle. Uh, inflation on the other hand, you can quell pretty quickly. So in other words, when you think about riskreward in terms of a dual mandate, let's assume this trend persists and the weakening job market uh persists and it wasn't solely attributable to liberation day and the uncertainty around liberation day, well then you're probably already too late with cuts. Uh however, if it is a short-term phenomenon and let's say you cut too early and all of a sudden employment starts roaring back with with CEO confidence and seauite confidence and inflation ticks up because uh you cut too quickly. Well, it's very easy to quell inflation. You could you could simply do a a hike of 25 or 50 basis points and put inflation back in the jar. You can't do a cut, you know, 25 basis point cut and put unemployment uh uh back in the jar. It just continues to persist and fear builds upon fear builds upon fear. And then you wind up having to go with, you know, if it's a serious recession, a half a trillion dollar, multiundred billion dollar stimulus to get the economy back on track and that worsens the deficit. So, uh, t\n\n### MISCELLANEOUS\nlook, I think you know if you look at the revisions going back multi-months that was a period of significant uncertainty.

So, uh, t\n\n\nUm, so if there's no downside to cut too soon, hypothetically, uh, and there's massive downside to stay restrictive and be too late Powell, well, you you have to take that into account. And now where you have the one governor resigning, you have dissent on the Fed. Uh for a guy that's so concerned about his legacy, uh now he's kind of boxed because if he's if he's right, he still has a legacenting him holding rates high. Um, and if he's wrong, he's totally screwed because everyone knew he's too late. Powell. So, uh, he's he's in a box now. He's got his out with this latest jobs report and he can use this to save face and pivot at Jackson Hole. The question is, will he or will he stay belligerent Powell and trying to uh kind of get back at the president? But that that doesn't help the world. It doesn't help the country and it certainly doesn't help those people uh that are in the labor market for sure. \n### MISCELLANEOUS\n>> I think we've got to go at least two. And I think that's all we're going to get. Uh we should probably do 75 to 100 basis points. That's kind of neutral. And that gives you enough cushion in case uh Powell's prophecy of uh inflation being more than a a one-off uh uh comes out to be true. Uh I I I think that's the right level. You know, if you look at housing being 16% of GDP, uh he's really put that in a box and that's that's hurting a tremendous amount of the population. You know, our largest portion of the population is the millennials and the uh average age of home buying has gone from first-time home buying has gone from 28 to now 38. That's put their whole lives on hold. That's that's um kind of um reduced the incentive to have children. If you can't afford a house, why are you going to have kids? And a lot of that generation because of Powell have now resigned themselves to not having children, not having the joy of family formation, not having the joy of a starter home, not having an ownership stake. So there are a lot of unintended consequences created by a guy who's interested in how he's written and not being Arthur Burns, which the current economic state has no resemblance to the conditions that Arthur Burns faced in the 70s, demographically, economically, or otherwise. It's a shame. Uh, you know, if you had said to me, David, uh, you know, six years ago, would you rather have a successful business person running the Fed or an academic? I would have said, business person, hands down. Uh, I I I was wrong. Uh, I give me the PhDs out the wazoo that actually understand the e uh uh economy or at least understand how to manage a central bank. I I think Powell would have been an incredible Treasury Secretary. I think he's a generally good, competent person. I don't think he has the skill set for the job. >> Uh, moving on from the Fed, do you think markets generally speaking are more recepted to Fed policy now or fiscal policy and especially trade certainty? In other words, what are the biggest triggers going forward for the rest of the year? >> I think the tariff policy is a headwind. I think the one big beautiful bill is a tailwind that's not yet priced in. So the shortterm negative effects of the tariff policy are being offset by the one big beautiful bill which is not fully priced in. So I think it's a it's a net positive allin uh and therefore I do think the economy reacelerates and what we found also you know going up 50% on India and and far 250% on pharmaceuticals and all this other stuff. What we know about this administration is they will bend things but not break them. They will bend them as far as they can get. But if if the bond market and the stock market starts to look uh like it's breaking like we saw in early April, they quickly uh show flexibility and rationality and they reverse those positions. So they want to get as much as they can without breaking things. And I think the intent of the administration and and rightfully so is for the economy to do as well as possible. And candidly, uh, President Trump does measure his success by what the Dow does. And, uh, he's not going to let it go to that far down because it's not helpful to people's retirements. It's not helpful to confidence. It's not helpful to animal spirits. And he wants to see it grow. And what we're seeing with real wages now coming back to levels not seen since his first term is Main Street is doing tremendously better than they did uh, prior to him coming in in the last four years. as Main Street real wages are reacelerating again and people on Main Street are doing better. >> Your overall thesis for the rest of the year in notes that you sent me, you reiterated your uh long stance and you wrote that um dips are to be bought. Sit on your hands and do nothing. You said uh elaborate. So >> yeah, we're look we're in the seasonally weak part of the year. August, September, October, everyone knows. So everyone's looking for a big correction. And I think what they're going to be disappointed with certainly those looking for big corrections 10 or 20% are going to be sorely disappointed because uh on average you get a 20% bare market correction every 3.5 years. We've had three in the last 5 years. So we've pulled forward 10.5 years of bare market corrections. uh uh I do think that uh you know 3 to 5 to 8% corrections are possible after a 30 something% move off the off the lows but what you have to keep in mind is uh there was record selling in the whole a trillion dollars of equities were sold the day before liberation day predominantly hedge funds institutional managers you know who got it right was the retail investors and they've gotten it right every single dip since co they've been buyers not sellers institutions and hedge funds have been wrong and now they're all dramatically behind their benchmark. So they can't buy the things that are already up. Uh they have to buy the lagards in an effort and they got to do it with leverage in an effort to catch up to their benchmark and keep their jobs. Which is why you have seen in the last 7 8 weeks one of the biggest pockets of outperformance 11% more than the S&P 500 has been the most shorted stocks. the most hated stocks, those lagards that um have been the last to move have now started to outperform and I think that's going to be the theme. So if we see some volatility in in the indices basically now if you talk about the S&P 500 you're just talking about MAG 7 and what did we see with MAG7 earnings the six or so that have reported is they were good okay but they're decelerating so last year 33% this quarter 14% earnings growth uh by Q3 next quarter what no one's really talking about it's going to be the first time that they're that earnings growth of the MAG 7 is 10% or slightly below 10% earnings growth. So why does that matter? It matters because the multiples relative to the earnings growth have not come down. If you look at the Microsoft's uh 10 10% earnings growth, 33 times multiple, the uh Amazon's 31 times multiple 8 12%. Are they great businesses? You bet. Are you paying up a little more than you should based on the earnings growth and certainly in a decelerating earnings growth environment? Yes. Contrast that with something like the small cap indices which will dramatically benefit from the uh reinitiation of Fed cuts more than anyone else because they've got the most leverage. And if you look at earnings growth for 2026, uh small Russell 2000 expected earnings growth is 37%. that's excluding the benefit in terms of their debt servicing when rates start to come down 50 75 basis points versus the S&P 500 at 14% earnings growth. Uh and furthermore, you're getting a much lower multiple still on small caps with more than double the earnings growth than you are on the S&P 500. So managers will have no choice but to start to buy those, start to buy the unmagnificent 493. So, if you're saying, \"Oh, do I buy the S&P 500 index right now?\" Which is basically saying, \"Oh, do I buy MAG 7 right now?\" I think you're going to be disappointed. You're probably going to be net up. So, if we get, you know, three, five, eight, 7, 8% uh volatility in the next few months. Maybe you do, maybe you don't. I think there are so many people off sides. I think the surprise would be that we actually push higher and don't get any material correction which would be the maximum pain trade right now because people are not positioned for that. More people are lightening up or behind the benchmark than are overweight and giddy right now. If you look at all the sentiment indicators, some are a little bit elevated, but they're not really giddy, which which kind of implies to me the the pain trade going into the fall with everyone looking at seasonal weaknesses, maybe we get more strength than expected, but certainly in the places that no one's focused on would be my bet. >> I wonder if they're more expensive because they're the best inclass businesses. And so if you're paying a bit of a premium on on valuations, it's because you're buying better businesses which would in theory outperform\nthe last any any period longer small cap value is the highest performer. So you know and that goes for value generally speaking. the the data got skewed in a in a period of 15 years of ZERP. So unless you're betting on ZERP coming back, uh that's probably not your highest and best use. And if you go back a h 100red years uh and you think about do I allocate you know 100% of my money to value or 100% of my money to growth. Well, if you put a million dollar in value versus growth uh in 1928 uh value you would have $68 million more dollars today because it outperforms on average about 4% not in aggregate 4% per year compounded over a hundred years. uh where people are sideways is like they were in the late 90s which is that growth has outperformed the last you know 10 years in this case therefore it's going to outperform forever uh and I think what people miss is a a great example is Amazon when you look at the palunteers and different great companies of the world Amazon was one of the greatest companies in 1999 and 2000 and we were all betting that what they said was going to happen in the future would happen in the future, which would be it would be the store of everything. They would deliver everything to your house. It would all be online, etc. And guess what? They did everything they said they were going to do over the next 15 years. The problem is uh in 1999 and 2000, you were paying for them already having delivered that 15 years of value at that time, 15 years early. So what happened over the next three years? Amazon stock was down 90% from 2000 to 2002 2003 and it wasn't down 90% from 2002 to 2002 2003 because we were in a recession okay because the fundamentals of Amazon's business in each of those years 2000 2001 2002 2003 continued to improve revenues continued to improve cash flow continued to improve earnings continue to improve the price of the stock went down 90%. Why would that happen? It happened because Amazon was a great company. Amazon is a great company. The problem was the short-term voting machine, the emotional voting machine was 15 years too early. You were paying for 15 years of performance uh 15 years too early. And therefore, the stock price had to correct to where the fundamentals actually were, not to where they would be. And then by the time as we got closer to 15 years out and all the things they said they were going to do in 2000 were actually happening, the price caught back up. And I think we're seeing that with a number of these super high-flying stocks right now that are doing unbelievable things and will be doing even better things 5 10 15 years out. The question is are you already paying for it? And will you have a reckoning in the intermediate term when the market says, \"Yeah, they're great.\" But you've already paid for the next 20 years of seamless perfect execution. So if they if they come in 1% lower than the perfect execution, you're not going to get a 1% pullback. You're going to get an 80% pullback. And those are the type of stocks we want to avoid. And what we want to do is look for our turnaround time specials that are durable, predictable businesses that have been generating cash for, you know, decades and have predictable trend lines of cash flow and uh and uh uh revenues that have a temporary dislocation because they're out of favor due to rates or due to sector dislocation. Where the short-term voting machine price is not pricing in 15 years of greatness. it's pricing in that they're going out of business and there's no way in hell they're going out of business. So therefore, when people when the mood shifts and the flavor of the month, the stock market, you know, it's like the stock market's like BaskinRobins. What's the flavor of the month? Right now, it's not those great companies that uh when that comes back into vogue and Rocky Road is back in flavor. You get doubles and triples in 24, 36 months. And that's what we like to do. Rinse and repeat over and over. Boring, durable businesses that furthermore, we can allocate massive amounts of capital. We can take 10% positions. You can't take a 10% position with a company that's trading at 100 times sales unless you're a cowboy and you're reckless because at some point maybe it'll double again. But you're gambling. You know, you have no downside protection because when it when the music stops on those names, it's not a a 3% pullback. It's a everyone rushes to the exit at the same time because there's no fundamental underpinning for the current price even if the businesses are fantastic. \n### MISCELLANEOUS\n>> Are there in the universe of Tom special stocks? Are there any uh sectors or subsectors within the AI infrastructure trade that would fit the criteria of not being super overvalued right now? In other words, AI infrastructure, how would you play that besides just buying those AI stocks outright? Yeah, I mean look, that's not a core theme for us because we think the actual key beneficiaries are going to be the >> companies that implement the AI which are not yet priced in the efficiencies and the margin improvement and the productivity and the margin expansion that's going to come to regular everyday business is not yet reflected. So if we're buying great businesses, they're going to become greater business with with the advent of AI. But in terms of like simple exposure to the theme, we like energy. Okay. So one of the names that we have around 78 bucks is Comtock Resources. Uh Jerry Jones owns the majority of the stock, 70 plus% of the stock. We're co-investors with him. Somewhere around $8 a share. It went up to $30 a share. It's now at $17. We're in the market buying more. it's going to 50 over the next two to three years. So, that's a no-brainer for us, continual uh demand for energy. Uh the other backdrop you need with all the data centers is generators. So, GenerRack has been a huge hit for us. Um uh started buying that thing below 100, shot up to 190, corrected, now it's back uh knocking on the door of 200. That probably goes to 250, 300 plus. Uh that's another energy play. I think the dark horse in all of this, I know there's a lot of noise around Intel and everyone's saying it's a, you know, baggy, you know what, but the fact of the matter is, you heard it from Trump yesterday, they've got to produce chips in the in the US and they're the only game in town. Yes, Taiwan Semiconductor has fabs and they can invest in that, but they want to invest in Intel. Intel and Lip Bhutan, that's going to be the dark horse surprise in the next 48 months. You can't give the stock away right now. If they liquidated it tomorrow, you get a 100% of your money back. Uh, and if on their legacy business, it's worth 40 45 $50. And if they actually get their production in gear, which now they've got a partner in the government going to have to backstock stop them. And Lit Bhutan, who at Cadence Designs had like a 50 plus bagger. This guy knows how to do turnarounds. He knows everyone in the industry. He's going to get it right. You wind up with a $100 stock. And that's something that I can sleep like a baby at night because I know what my downside is and my upside's unlimited. If they get half of their projections right versus buying something that's already priced for absolute perfection and then, you know, if they if they miss by 1%, the stock's down 50%. So, I'd rather buy it when it's already down that much and then get my doubles and triples versus holding on with white knuckles and praying to God that the next earnings call they don't, you know, wrinkle their nose the wrong way and everyone runs for the exits. \n### HEADLINES_AND_NEWS\n>> Here's another piece of news that I'd like you to comment on. So, the Trump brothers, uh, Donald Trump's sons are now, uh, backing manufacturing spack, filing for $300 million US IPO. Uh, it's going to be called New America Acquisition uh, Corp. Uh, New America said in the filing that it aims to buy businesses with a combined enterprise value of 700 million or more and will target companies that play a meaningful role in revitalizing domestic manufacturing, expanding innovation ecosystems and strengthening critical supply chains. Is that are those themes that you're so interested in as a manager? >> Yes. Yeah. I think I think the reshoring is going to be a key theme. I look I think they're playing a lot of the thematic plays. They're obviously heavy in crypto. I was at the New York Stock Exchange. They were um promoting some gun company. So, you know, they're they've got their hands in a lot of pots. But I do think that theme of uh manufacturing resurgence in the US is a durable theme. And some of these technologies, whether it's AI, robotics, whether it's uh uh are going to help accelerate that because what what largely makes the US uncompetitive is regulations and labor costs. So Trump is going to gut the regulations and some of these technologies uh brought to you by robotics brought to you by AI. I mean we're seeing it in one holding we have GXO Logistics which uh which Brad Jacobs uh was one of Brad Jacobs spin-offs one of the greatest wealth creators for stockholders in history whether it was Waste Connections, United Rentals, XPO, now he's got QXO and he has GXO. uh they're one of the biggest utilizers of these humanoid type of robots in their warehouses. Not not the Tesla ones, but other companies make great robots. Uh and they will continue to benefit and that's a huge scaled business with one of the largest logistics providers in the world and uh warehousing and uh um uh etc. Shipping return they they handle returns for major companies. So uh I think you're going to see more and more of that and as the GXOs of the world can implement more of this automation their margins are going to go up and up and up which is going to uh giving give them price uh competition and scale where they can just squeeze out all the competitors over time. So I want to be in those forwardinking companies that are actually utilizing the technology versus the ones that are creating it and trying to guess who's the winner. I I'd rather bet on sure durable businesses that have a free option of massive margin expansion by utilizing the technologies versus gambling on who's going to get the technology right. >> Okay. And then\n\n### FEATURED_COMPANY_DEEP_DIVES\nmanufacturing resurgence in the US is a durable theme. And some of these technologies, whether it's AI, robotics, whether it's uh uh are going to help accelerate that because what what largely makes the US uncompetitive is regulations and labor costs. So Trump is going to gut the regulations and some of these technologies uh brought to you by robotics brought to you by AI. I mean we're seeing it in one holding we have GXO Logistics which uh which Brad Jacobs uh was one of Brad Jacobs spin-offs one of the greatest wealth creators for stockholders in history whether it was Waste Connections, United Rentals, XPO, now he's got QXO and he has GXO. uh they're one of the biggest utilizers of these humanoid type of robots in their warehouses. Not not the Tesla ones, but other companies make great robots. Uh and they will continue to benefit and that's a huge scaled business with one of the largest logistics providers in the world and uh warehousing and\n\nI think if you look through history and you over the last hundred years, any country, any region, pretty much when you have at the bulk of your population in their mid30s, that is the period when they do the most consumption, family formation, housing formation. It has been delayed by bad policies by Jay Powell, but it's pent up and I think that's that's durable and it tends to drive above trend growth and above trend spending, above trend consumption uh at least until their early to mid4s. So our base case is that we are in the second leg of a durable bull market that probably goes into the early 2030s. So any of these three, five, eight, I I I I think we're our pullbacks this year are going to be contained to three to eight% if any. Uh and and as we look out into the 2030s, 20% corrections are to be bought, not sold. Uh and then I I would say things could could meaningfully start to slow like we saw uh you know, 2000 to 2015 as we get get out to the early 2030s into the 2040s. I' I'd be a lot more cautious, but but right now uh if I can find out of favor stocks and sectors with a margin of safety, I'm buying all day long.\n### MISCELLANEOUS\nAre you um positioning for higher beta plays besides the small caps which we talked about? >> Are you looking specifically for more higher beta, more volatile plays in this bull market or are you mostly sticking to um you know beta closer to one? Yeah. >> Yeah. I I don't I don't think in in those terms. I don't think in terms of sharp ratios. I don't think in terms of beta. I think that's that's noise created by consultants. What I do is I look at a business by business basis. And and\n\nhere is  my filter. Okay? Uh I will underwrite a business as if you were going to buy three Jersey Mike's franchises down the street. If I if I said to you, David, uh there's three franchises in aggregate. They generate uh a million dollars after tax per year. Okay. And then I said um and they do call it $3 million a year of revenue in aggregate. And I said um I want $400 million for him because there's a growth opportunity. Would would you would you write that check? And the answer is you'd be you'd be like, \"You're out of your mind.\"\n\nwhat I try to do is I look at businesses that the prices come down a lot and they have a long history of performance both revenue, free cash flow, earnings and they tend to have normal cycles every 10 to 10 to 8 to 10 years where the the price pulls back quite a bit and the price pulls back a lot more than the free cash flow temporary impairment, a lot more than the revenue temporary impairment and sometimes t\n\nhere is\n\nno impairment in the underlying fundamentals. It's just the flavor of the week is strawberry. It's not rocky road. And I get to buy great businesses at 60 70% off. And turnaround Tom plays the the game where I have my edge, which is called time arbitrage. I'm patient. I don't, you know, if I buy a stock that's down, you know, 60% and it goes down 65%. It like I don't even think about it because how I underwrote it, David, is very simple. If JP Morgan was going to finance me to buy 100% of the business myself with the only caveat is I had to put up 100% of my net worth as the equity. Okay? So, let's say it's a $200 million business and they say, \"We'll give you $170 million of debt, but you have to put $30 million of cash up. And if the business does poorly, we get the business. Your 30 million is wiped out. If the business does well, well, because of the leverage you have on it, that 30 million is going to be worth 300 million. I will do the deal. If I'm not willing to put up a 100% of my net worth to buy the business, why would I even buy one share? And the the difference between my framework and most people is they see Tesla's going up in the news or whatever company is going up in the news and their friend uh you know bought a share and they're it went up and they you know they traded in their Honda for a C series Mercedes and they've got to jump on the thing and then they get holding the bag like 2001 with Amazon because they bought a great business at the wrong price. So we try to buy good businesses at a great price and then we just trade out of them in three, four, five years when they've, you know, usually two to 4x because we bought them at great prices and their cash flows and revenues are very very predictable. And that's where I got the nickname Turnaround Tom. We just rinse and repeat. We buy predictable businesses. We don't have to guess the future. We don't have to play the the Bureau of Labor Statistics game on a month-to-month basis. We don't give a you know what about that stuff. What we care about is is free cash flow going up? If it's not going up, why is it not going up? Is it a temporary impairment? Is it a permanent impairment? How is how is have they handled it through other cycles? Is their moat still durable or is it permanently impaired? And we look at that competitive advantage. And then the final filter is would I put up 100% of my net worth? If I w if I wouldn't put up 100% of my net worth, why would I buy one share for myself or for clients if I'm not willing to take that? So, we underwrite 8 to 10 companies. It's kind of like private equity in the public markets would be the way to think about it. Uh, and we don't worry about the short-term noise on a day-to-day basis. And, uh, it's a very happy, easy way to live. Low leverage. Uh, and we're not white knuckling every earnings report. We could care less. Well, to answer your own question, the rhetorical question as to whether or not or why you would put, you know, why you wouldn't buy a company if you wouldn't uh, you know, put 100% of your own net worth. Well, what if, let's say, I were to say to you, during a bull market, animal spirits are high and so you could maybe put a small percentage of your net worth into basically gambling because that's what everybody else is doing. >> Um, is there some merit to that? >> Yeah. >> So, rule number one, don't lose money. Rule number two, don't forget rule number one. The number one lesson I learned in this business at the first hedge fund I worked with and my boss was a very wealthy and smart guy and he said never let them take you out on a stretcher. And what happens is is it starts like I'll just do a small percentage and it goes up a lot and they don't know why it went up but it went up because you know whatever happens it's a meme stock. It's it's the flavor of the month. You know strawberry is everyone wants strawberry this month. it goes up and they mistake luck for skill. >> So why would you do a 1% bet that turned into 2% when you could do a 30% bet that turns into 60%. So the next time they try 30% and you know what? They're even more brilliant. And it happens again. And 30% goes to 60%, they have no idea why. Why the hell would you bet 30% and double your money when you could bet 100% and double your money? And sure enough, they do it and it goes from 100 to 200. Now they're just a genius. They're already looking at calling a lawyer. How are they going to start their own hedge fund? Because like, you know, working at Walmart, why would I work at Walmart when I could double my money every time I buy a stock? And and then what happens is they say, why would I buy 100% position when I could actually take margin and buy 200% position and double that and it becomes 400 or 300 on my capital. And guess what? this the ambulance comes, they take them out on a stretcher, they lose their dog, they lose their wife, they lose their house. It's like a country song in reverse and uh no one ever hears from them again except 10 years later you see them on the street and they've got a police badge on and it's like, \"Oh, how you been?\" \"I I decided to become a police officer.\" So, you know, you see this stuff over and over. if you've been through enough cycles, it it tastes good until you see the extra pounds on the scale and then before you know it, uh you know, you can't get rid of it. So, uh there have been very few people that play that gambling game that walk away from the casino with chips. Uh but the people who are investing in building the casinos and have a durable business plan, they make money all day long. So, be the casino, not the gambler.\n### MEDIA_APPEARANCE_RECAP\n>> Understood. Where can we learn more from you and um and I guess get your uh Tom specials? >> Yeah.

I'll be uh you know talking with with um Tom here as things go along. But we want to make sure if you do have any\n\n basically, we've had a huge move off the lows in April. Uh, you remember probably from the money show and certainly uh from the podcast, etc., we were extremely bullish in the hole when when people were selling handover fist. This was a man-made correction. We figured it could be solved with a one man-made tweet, and it certainly was. Uh, and the problem is is you had all these managers off sides. Actually, hedge funds dumped a trillion dollars of equities in the hole the day before liberation day. Uh, and now they are forced to play catch-up. So, they spent the first half of the 30 something% rally off the lows. Um, you know, praying for a retest. They always look for the retest which never came. Then they had to cover their shorts. So they were the first buyers which exacerbated the rally. Uh and now they're really screwed because uh not only did they sell at the wrong time, but they didn't buy to uh take advantage of the recovery. So they're dramatically they've lost both ways and most of them have material career risk. And people say, well, why does the keep market keep going up and we're trading at 22 times forward earnings? Uh and this is part of the reason. And I don't think that structural bid is going to change uh into year end because there are so many managers that got caught off sides. I'll tell you who generally got it right, who's got it right since co is the quote unquote dumb money has been right every single pullback and correction since 2020. Uh and they're right again and they made a ton of money. Uh, and I know a lot of the listeners, the hedge fund tips with Tom Hayes made a lot of money buying the lows, but uh, on a serious note, this is likely to continue into year end. So, we're entering a seasonally weak part of the year. As you know, Mike, and as a lot of people know, August, September, October tends to be the volatile periods, but a lot of people are stuck with recency bias and are thinking we're going to get a big correction at 20 20%. Uh, and they're pessimistic with the jobs numbers, and they're pessimistic with the Fed. Uh, and I think what you're going to find is that is absolutely not the case because of the conditions that I've said. and any 3 to 5% pullbacks do need to be bought because uh managers are going to have to be in the market. >> I'm glad you bring that up because I mean you can pick and choose from any number of\n\n### MEDIA_APPEARANCE_RECAP\nActually, hedge funds dumped a trillion dollars of equities in the hole the day before liberation day. Uh, and now they are forced to play catch-up. So, they spent the first half of the 30 something% rally off the lows. Um, you know, praying for a retest. They always look for the retest which never came. Then they had to cover their shorts. So they were the first buyers which exacerbated the rally. Uh and now they're really screwed because uh not only did they sell at the wrong time, but they didn't buy to uh take advantage of the recovery. So they're dramatically they've lost both ways and most of them have material career risk. And people say, well, why does the keep market keep going up and we're trading at 22 times forward earnings? Uh and this is part of the reason. And I don't think that structural bid is going to change uh into year end because there are so many managers that got caught off sides.\n\n### HEADLINES_AND_NEWS\nI would say that on average for the last 100 years, uh, we've had a 20% correction every 3.5 years. We've actually had three of those in the last 5 years, 2020, 2022, and this year, intraday, uh, 20% pullback. So, we've pulled forward uh, 10.5 years of bare market corrections uh, into five. So, what's easy to think is we've we've had nothing but 20% corrections. We're going to get another 20% correction now because the market's overvalued, etc. Um, and I think what's going to surprise people is that we're likely not going to get a 20% correction for longer than you expect. So, the 3 to 5s, yes, the probably 10% scary correction, uh, pullbacks for sure, uh, but they will be bought. And I think the other thing to keep in mind is if you look at MA Magnificent 7 and I know this has been a theme and I know this they've been they were impacted earlier this year and then they bounced off the lows here uh in April with with the catch-up trade is the earnings growth uh as good as earnings have been by the way the earnings were pretty solid for MAG 7 uh is decelerating. So last year was 33%. This quarter was 14% for the Mag 7 that have already reported. We'll get Nvidia in August. But next quarter will be the first quarter that Magnificent 7 earnings growth actually drops below right around 10% maybe a little bit below 10%. That's that's the bad news. The the other bad news is that the multiples have not contracted consistent with the contraction of earnings growth contraction. So uh you've got you know the Microsofts of the world still trading at 33 times PE with 10% earnings growth. You've got the Amazon's trading at 31 times with 8.5% earnings growth. And then you shift over and you look at uh scenarios like uh small caps that are going to have 37% earnings growth in 2026 compared with the S&P 500 at 14 uh 14% earnings growth and yet the multiple for small caps you get more than double the earnings growth for you know meaningfully lower multiple I think that's where the managers are going to be forced to buy. So, you know, put yourself in the position of a hedge fund manager or a long only manager in Boston and, you know, you got nervous. Your clients, you know, told you to sell in in April. We don't know what's going to happen with this crazy crazy leadership or however they phrased it. Uh, and they got it wrong. Uh, and now you've got to catch up to the benchmark, which is now, you know, back to to highs. You can't buy those things that have risen aggressively. So you have to buy those things that have good fundamentals but the price has not yet caught up the the lagards uh that are high quality that are generating free cash less so the the shiny objects although we're still you know we're still seeing that we're still going to see that in pockets.\n\nearnings were pretty solid for MAG 7 uh is decelerating.

So you have to buy those things that have good fundamentals but the price has not yet caught up the the lagards uh that are high quality that are generating free cash less so the the shiny objects although we're still you know we're still seeing that we're still going to see that in pockets. The other thing that I'd like to say because this is a value uh type of theme conference is it's very easy to get caught in the noise right now and think you have to chase the hottest stock in the\n### MISCELLANEOUS\nheadlines . But if you step back uh since 1928, value has outperformed growth by about 4% not in aggregate by about 4% per year compounded. >> So if you had put a million dollar in value versus a million dollars in growth in 1928, you would have $68 million more dollars having invested in value versus investing in growth. And it's easy to get caught because right now you get a lot of guys who look extremely smart in the short term, but if you've been around long enough, they all blow up sooner or later. Uh, you know, there are a handful of growth managers that have outperformed and continue to outperform uh over the long term like Don Baron, but you can count it on, you know, uh, less than one hand. Uh, the guys who chase the shiny objects and live to tell the story. in the short term they can have 200% years and look like uh you know geniuses because you know it's always it's always it's always the same story which is this time it's different. Uh the world has changed. You know the model is different. You're never going to uh that that was the old days and sure enough in the long term uh the market is a weighing machine based on fundamentals. In the short term it's a voting machine based on emotions. So right now you're seeing some people benefit from the short-term voting machine based on emotions and that will continue until it stops and when it stops it stops extremely abruptly versus when you own cashg generative stocks you don't worry about the short-term price fluctuations as long as the uh underlying fundamentals are improving and they're generating cash because when you generate cash you have a huge amount of optionality. You can buy back stock, you can issue dividends, you can buy other companies, you can increase in in uh increase production where you see opportunities to earn above your weighted average cost of capital. Uh so everything's for you and then it's just a waiting game for when uh that style falls back into favor. And I think the conditions are set right now that managers are going to be forced into that style because you can't chase things that are up trading at 100 times sales. I mean, you can do it and try to get the last squeeze out of the lemon, but but good luck because when the air pocket hits, there's no floor. >> It's interesting you bring it up and that's why I was kind of looking off to my screen over here. I've got, you know, I've got IWO, the you know, Russell 2000 growth up about 1.6%, not much. IWN value down 1.9%, S&P 8% give or take. And then you've got a name like Palunteer that as of yesterday was up 112% year to date, 500 and something% in the last year and it's having another spectacular day as we as we do this session. So, you know, talk a little bit more again about the rotation. Is it really just it's going to be that catch-up trade that sort of gets people out of the the hot stuff over here and into the not so hot yet stuff? Is there something going else on like macroeconomically or or you know, fund flow-wise that you're really looking for to make that pivot happen? Yeah, I don't know that it has to be either or. I I think it can be both. And I I think people will want to have a little bit of exposure to the highf flyers to the Mag 7 because uh the recency bias is there. That's what's worked. They expect will continue to work. But I also think that uh if they're behind their benchmarks, they're going to have to have exposure to the things that are just leaving the station uh versus the the things that have uh really flown. And if you look at for instance uh the Boeings, you know, just a four, five, six weeks ago, you couldn't give away the stock at $135. And we're pounding the table on Fox Business and they're looking at me like, you know, trying not to fall asleep and the thing's up double in in 8 weeks. And if you look at the Disneys of the world, you couldn't give away in the low 80s and at 120, people are starting to talk about it. These are stories that are are basically just getting started and and they're they're stories uh Generrack 75% of the home standby generator. I mean, here's a one that got down to the low 100s and now is back up to 195, almost doubles. Uh and those are ones that we like because we can put an enormous amount of money to work and sleep like a baby at night. Like I can't imagine having a stock trading at 100 times sales and putting you know 10% of our portfolio our clients money into that stock and just praying every morning that the market doesn't rerate it to 50 time sales even and even that like I if I told you um you know uh Boeing was trading at 50 times sales or something like that you know I mean obviously the growth rates are different. Obviously, these are these are new high-f flyers, but it's amazing how quickly on the one hand, recency bias causes people to do crazy things. They extrapolate what's happened in the recent past is going to persist indefinitely. And we know if you've been around more than 5 minutes that, you know, the these things wind up in face plants, okay? It's just a matter of time. Uh uh a great example was Amazon.com. Amazon.com in 1999 two 2000 was talking about all the amazing things that they were going to do. Uh they were going to have home delivery. They were going to be the store of everything. You could buy everything online and it would be delivered to your house. Uh and here's the funny thing about Amazon in 1999 and 2000. It was trading whatever it was trading 100 times sales or one of these ridiculous uh multiples. Everything that they promised you that they would do, they have done. But do you know what happened over the next three years? The stock was down 90%. And by the way, during the period that the stock fell 90% from 2000 to 2002 or 2003, the underlying fundamentals of the business got better. It's not like it was down 90% because the sales fell 90%. The fundamentals got better. The problem was when the market wakes up on these shiny object stocks and it realizes that the growth rates may not persist forever or even worse everything that's that we expect is going to happen will happen. The problem is, wait a second, we're already paying for what we think might happen in the best case scenario 20 years from now. And when you're paying for 20 years of perfect execution, if they execute 1% less than perfection and you're already paying for 20 years, t\n\n### MISCELLANEOUS\nknow 10% of our portfolio our clients money into that stock and just praying every morning that the market doesn't rerate it to 50 time sales even and even that like I if I told you um you know uh Boeing was trading at 50 times sales or something like that you know I mean obviously the growth rates are different. Obviously, these are these are new high f flyers, but it's amazing how quickly on the one hand, recency bias causes people to do crazy things. They extrapolate what's happened in the recent past is going to persist indefinitely. And we know if you've been around more than 5 minutes that, you know, the these things wind up in face plants, okay? It's just a matter of time. Uh uh a great example was Amazon.com. Amazon.com in 1999 two 2000 was talking about all the amazing things that they were going to do. Uh they were going to have home delivery. They were going to be the store of everything. You could buy everything online and it would be delivered to your house. Uh and here's the funny thing about Amazon in 1999 and 2000. It was trading whatever it was trading 100 times sales or one of these ridiculous uh multiples. Everything that they promised you that they would do, they have done. But do you know what happened over the next three years? The stock was down 90%. And by the way, during the period that the stock fell 90% from 2000 to 2002 or 2003, the underlying fundamentals of the business got better. It's not like it was down 90% because the sales fell 90%.

The problem is, wait a second, we're already paying for what we think might happen in the best case scenario 20 years from now. And when you're paying for 20 years of perfect execution, if they execute 1% less than perfection and you're already paying for 20 years, t\n\nthe weighing machine wins in the long term. So I can't tell you whether Palunteer goes to 400 time sales or 200 time sales or 100 time sales. I mean there's obviously they're doing things that are special and the question is and they're a great company and they have strong leadership and all that stuff. Um the question is how much of the future lifech changing impact of their product is already priced into the stock today. And this company could do everything that he's talking about for or 10xing the revenues. Uh you know, look, if he 10xes revenues, it's still trading at 10 times sales. So, you know, if it's trading at 100 times now. So, the question is what's the right price? And and uh no one asks that question until there's a little bit of an air pocket in the economy or in the market or in performance or you know candidly the ones that are chasing it because it's up so much are going to be the same ones panicking out when it's down 5%. And then there'll be a different batch that are panicking when it's down 10%. And there'll be a different batch that absolutely puke it out when it's down 20%. And then there are ones that will puke it in the hole down 60%. ### MISCELLANEOUS\nuh when guys like me start to look at it seriously and and take a look at it for the long term and see if there's too much blood in the streets relative to the incredible things that they're doing. So, it's just a different framework and and I would say too, Mike, I think people have this scarce mindset that it has to be either or either you're a growth manager and that's good or you're a value manager and that's bad or or vice versa. And I don't view it that way. I I think you're you're going to have a guest on named Dan Ives. I think he's brilliant and I think he operates in a different framework and a different model that works exceptionally well for him and I like him very much and I listen to what he said what he says and and uh uh and and respect what he says and learn from what he says but I I just operate in a different framework and I'm perfectly comfortable with errors of omission. Okay, this is what I learned from Charlie Mer. Like when God was handing out FOMO jeans, he didn't hand one out to Tom Hayes. So I'm genetically different. I I don't I don't lose a wink of sleep over a stock that's runaway and going crazy that I'm that I'm not participating in. A lot of people do because they see their neighbor, they upgraded from a Toyota to a Hyundai or what whatever the hell happened. like it it doesn't matter because I know in the long term the weighing machine like we do exceptionally well and do following our framework and staying in our lane and sticking with our knitting. ### FEATURED_COMPANY_DEEP_DIVES\nUm and I think that people have to get comfortable maybe you're genetically wired to be a growth investor and just do it better than anyone else. You got uh William O'Neal kind of set the framework. Subscribe to Investors Business Daily. Buy the book How to Make Money in Stocks and you can be a growth investor. Uh if you want to, you know, if if you think more business-like about how to why you buy a piece of a business is for uh a piece of the future cash flow, then you know, you're probably genetically wired to be a better value investor than a growth investor. And it doesn't mean you're different. It just means like, you know, one kid, one of my daughters loves chocolate, one loves vanilla. And it's never going to change. That's just how they're wired. So, accept it. And uh and one's not better than the other. It's just a different framework. And if you want to win at one framework, listen to people who are really good at one framework. Don't listen to me about how to buy the next Palunteer. Listen to me about how to buy Generrack when it's down 70% even though it's got 75% of the home standby generator market and it doubles over a few, you know, couple years. >> Got it. And I I want to leave plenty of time for you to talk about today's picks, but if anybody's listening to this, I do want to point out, I mean, Tom highlighted some of the names that he's been in even longer than he's talked about them at at money show events. But on my screen here, just year to date, for example, Generrack up about 27%, Boeing up about 26%, Advanced Auto Parts was another name up 15%. Uh, and again, these are names that he's been in for a lot longer. So, understand the profit potential is there if you get the timing and the price right. uh even not just relative to the market but relative to some of these great growth names that get the\n\nand sticking with our knitting.

Uh, and again, these are names that he's been in for a lot longer. So, understand the profit potential is there if you get the timing and the price right. uh even not just relative to the market but relative to some of these great growth names that get the headlines  but the sort of you know behind the scenes you're making again if you get into these value names at the right point the profits uh can be phenomenal. So it's not just >> by by the way it's not even that it's it's yes buying the stocks down and then waiting you know our average holding period is 12 to 48 months. So you can make quick doubles and triples, you know, quick meaning on average 36 months, which is, you know, an IR that exceeds the S&P 500. But when you buy companies that have such predictable cash flows when the price is down, we do a derivative overlay in a small bucket of the portfolio and that adds such extreme returns without taking meaningful risk to these names because they're so predictable for us. So if the if the stock price goes up, you know, 50% on a small bucket, we can have expected value on different spreads of 5x on that on that boring sleepy name. And um so it's it's kind of like a um it's nuanced because it's not just these slow doubles and triples. It's how we're able to express it for clients that makes boring stocks with predictable and sleep well at night incredible returns over time. >> Got it. Well, let's talk about one of the names that I know you've mentioned before, but I mean you're still a fan of it. It's something that that I think is appropriate for this audience that is talking here, and that's Cooper Standard. You know, auto part supplier, correct? Uh what's the story there? Why has it worked so far? And why do you think there's more, you know, more to come in a name like that? >> Yeah, Cooper Standard. So, they reported on Friday. They took up their guidance. They took down the industry estimates of annual production. So, they're very levered. Uh we got this idea from Charlie Munger did a similar turnaround situation uh in the recession of 2001 to 2003. Company named Tenico. Uh they were an auto parts supplier. Maybe you remember them. Uh they were down you know 90s something% they had $1.1 billion of debt. They had to refinance it. People thought they were going out of business. Buffett bought it at a buck and change. Uh they refinanced the debt. He got out a year, year and a half later at 15 bucks. It subsequently went on to 35 bucks, you know, but uh error of omission, no big deal. And uh so we looked at this COVID situation. We're like, what's the most dislocated businesses that we could maybe replicate? And we started looking in the auto parts suppliers and we found a company called Cooper Standard. This was May of 2022. And Cooper Standard, same story. They had a billion dollars. They had to refinance. They have refinanced a lot of that out to nothing to deal with until 2027 and then later in the decade. So, uh, we built a position in May 2022 in the fives. Okay, $5 and change. I think today it's, you know, 20, $25, something like that. So, 5x on the bulk of it. We've added clients in at 10. We've added clients in at 13, 14, $15, etc. as they've come in later and later. This is a simple play. This is a business with huge operating leverage. They're uh they do ceiling systems around the doors and windows, that rubber stuff that goes around uh fluid transfer systems. Very boring. And it's a leverage play on the recovery of US SAR sell through the number of units sold. Okay. And if you go back 50 years, despite the fact that the population was a lot less uh 50 years ago, maybe 220 million versus 330 million, uh every single cycle peak came in between 17.1 million cars and 18.5 million cars going all the way back to 1980. uh we got down to 15.1 million cars at the trough of uh COVID. Okay. And we're still not yet at we're in in like the mid5s to high 15s. And part of that's been high rates. Uh uh part of it is cars last longer. Part of it is the demography. But all of those things are coming back together. Okay. Number one, we got uh a 90.4% 4% chance of a cut in September as of this morning. Rates are coming down. The car volumes are starting to come back. The average car on the road is 13.5 years. And this was a $146 stock at the last cycle peak uh when SAR was over 17 million in 2017. They earned $7.19 in 2017 and the stock traded at 146. We bought it at 5. They refinanced the debt. It quickly doubled. Uh the volumes have not yet recovered. We believe based on the amount of costs that they've taken out of the business, hundreds of millions of dollars of costs, that when the the cycle volumes, they don't even have to go back to 17 million, which they will, by the way. Most people don't think they will. Even at 16.5 to 17 million, this business is not going to earn $7 a share because they've become so much more efficient. We think it can earn $10 a share. So if it traded at $146 at $7.19 of earnings, call it 20 times earnings. Um at $10 earnings, the question is what multiple does the market apply when we hit the next cycle peak? Does it apply 10 times? Then you got a $100 stock in which case it would be 20 20 bagger off of our initial basis. Uh 10 bagger off of some of the the later people that came in. Uh if you get a 20 times multiple again, a peak multiple, you could have a $200 stock. Is that our base case? No. But would it surprise us if we wind out wind up with a blended 20x 15 20x 25x on it? No. And this is something that's very easy. We don't have to predict is someone willing to pay 150 time sales versus 125 times sales and just gamble there will be people coming in buying us. I mean, it's a very simple formula. At 10 times earnings, it's not going to be hard to attract a lot of buyers. At 15 times earnings, if they're generating 10 bucks, it it's not unrealistic to think it could trade to 150 to 200. And if you and if you're skeptical, cut it in half. You still have a triple from these levels. Uh, which, you know, over a three four year period is a pretty attractive scenario. So nothing is perfectly without risk, but we try to minimize risk and cover. You know, I was taught number one, never let them take you out on a stretcher. That was my first boss. Okay. So, uh, and and number two, if you protect the downside, the upside take takes care of itself. And that's what we try to do every day is sleep every night, underwrite it as if you're buying the whole company. And if you're not willing to buy the whole company with 100% of your net worth as the equity, don't buy one share. You don't have to be involved in everything.

You know, if you own 10 10 franchises, you're not sitting at a screen uh watching the cash register things tick up and down and saying, \"Oh my gosh, you know, receipts are down uh 8% in the last 60 minutes. I better sell that franchise.\" Like, you know, it's uh that's just not the way it works. And candidly, that's why, you know, a lot of my clients have made, you know, fortunes, hundreds of millions of dollars in real estate. Um, I think part of the reason a lot of people become wealthy in real estate is because they don't have daily liquidity. I think if they did have daily liquidity, they'd be in a lot of trouble. That and they have a lot of leverage in real estate. Uh, and they pay no taxes. So, those three things are helpful. But, uh, there have been plenty of people that, uh, you know, there's the old saying, if you want to become a multi-millionaire, get into real estate. Uh, buy buy real estate. If you want to become a billionaire, buy businesses. And you've seen that from the icons and the Buffets. uh uh and the Coopermanmans of the world and some of the private equity guys etc. So we we just try to underwrite it as if if we were buying the whole business and if you operate from that framework I think you're going to be very happy. I think in the short term it's it's kind of the tortoise in the hair. Uh in the short term the hair is going to look really good and be winning the race and then all of a sudden it falls flat on its face because it runs out of gas and the air pockets come and the the turtle just walks right by because he just plots along doing his thing that doesn't get distracted. doesn't look this way, it doesn't look that way. Uh, and sure enough, they wind up with the with the gold medal. >> I definitely want to leave time for your next pick. It's kind of an interesting name when I saw you come through in the in the energy space. But before I do, just briefly on Cooper tariff issues, anything that that's going to mean for for this company's business, uh, the way you look at it? uh they've they've addressed that in the recent uh conference calls and and and that's another important thing is like if you own a piece of a business and you're not listening to the people you've hired to run that business for you, which is the the managers, you're you're really missing out. I mean, you know, we go through every earnings call transcript with literally a fine tooth comb. Our weekly articles we cover, we underline literally word for word the most important things they said. and you miss that nuance. And some people try to get cute with AI and they say summarize the call and you really miss how they were saying it. And sometimes listening is better even than reading because you can get a sense of the nuance and really it's like if I'm having a conversation with you and and you say, \"I'm really excited about Palunteer.\" Or you say, \"I'm really excited about Palanteer.\" You know, it's going to show up the same in the transcript, but you could say, \"I don't know. he seems like he's he's not excited, you know, or he's like he's he's like super excited. I better look into this. Uh so so so missing that nuance is kind of it's it's a little old school, but there's a lot of value to it because you got human beings running your business. When one day we'll have humanoid robots and maybe it'll be different, but for now, uh missing that nuance can be very very you can leave a lot of money on the table, uh doing that. So uh we we try to try to focus on that. >> What what was the question? >> Oh, sure. just briefly, you know, tariff impact on on the >> Oh, yeah. So, so they've been they've been they've been able to dramatically min minimize that. Uh, a lot of it they're not shipping crossber. They're shipping to factories within where they produce within the countries that they produce. So, it becomes the OEM issue. It becomes the Ford and the GM's issue more than the Cooper standard. It's not without impact, but they've really meaningfully minimized it and it's it's priced in at this level and it's not going to ultimately have meaningful impact on the volumes because at the end of the day, you still have the average car on the road 13.5 years, they they break down, they get scrapped after a while. So, uh I think the big thing, the number one driver of volumes, forget about looking at Cooper Standard, forget about looking, all I'm looking at is incentives. And if you look at the industry incentives on cars, meaning just go watch a football game, are you seeing more ads that say 0% financing or 2.9% financing? Are you seeing less ads? The answer is you're seeing a lot more ads. And that's not great for the OEMs because their margins are going to contract. It's going to be a race to the bottom. They they thought they could get away with this controlled scarcity that they got away with during COVID where they could sell the Escalades at 20,000 above MSRP. that game is over. The Koreans are coming in. If if the US producers aren't going to provide volumes, the Koreans and the Japanese are and therefore uh it's a race to bond. We're going to see huge amounts of volumes, which benefits the Cooper Standard and other auto suppliers. Uh it may not it'll help their volume numbers, the OEMs, but their margins are going to contract because the incentives are going to go up. The more the incentives go up due to competition, the bigger the volumes and we get paid per car. uh and that that's where we really benefit. So if you look through these cycles, the number one indicator of where volumes are headed are are incentives uh and the incentives have been going up in a straight line for the basically the past 12 13 months. So it's early days. It usually goes for 36 to 48 months and that's where you get that huge operating leverage kick in and uh huge profits to the bottom line. >> Got it. Got it. Well, let's move on. Energy services, oil feed, oil field services, if I can get that out there. Uh that's one of your names. talk a little bit about this other idea you brought to the table. >> Yeah, so we're trying to figure out a way we had a we still have a company called Comtock Resources which is natural gas. We want to have energy exposure partially because it's out of favor uh partially because of the energy policies of this administration. Now if you look to uh Trump 1.0 energy stocks actually did poorly because you know increased production reduces profitability. So how could we benefit from these this change in policy uh without being as sensitive to the price of the commodity and what we came out up with was oil field services uh national oil wellvarco as they used to be called now they're called nov inc uh is a leader in OEM in onshore and offshore drilling rigs they not only produce them they service them they have the largest install base the largest share Uh so I think what you're going to see we we're probably at or near the trough in terms of rig count. As that starts to tick up their operating leverage is huge. And usually with these energy companies um they have levered balance sheets. And in the case of National Oil Well Varco, they got $1.2 billion of cash. They got $1.7 billion of debt. They're generating a billion dollars of free cash flow per year in in kind of the worst part of the cycle. So, we don't have to worry about whether they're going to be here. And we, as a leader in what they do, again, the operating leverage is enormous. So, even if the rigs tick up just a hair, the money that's going to go straight to the bottom line with 50% install base, uh, is going to be staggering and it's going to make a billion dollars of free cash flow look like nothing. They'll be generating two and three and four billion. And you're going to have a stock that goes from, you know, 12 bucks to 40 50 bucks uh over the next few years. in our opinion, not advice. Uh, and these are the type of things that we look for. Our downsides protected because their balance sheet income statement is is is solid. They're they're generating a ton of free cash flow to service the small amount of relative debt that they have. And they're doing it in the worst operating environment. So, two things that happen. Number one, drilling happens more when the price of oil goes up. And number two, which people aren't thinking about, drilling happens more when the cost of leverage goes down. Most of these EMP companies are have levered balance sheets. So if they can refinance at lower rates, which we expect will be the case uh in the next handful of months, uh that changes the economics to the prices that where it becomes profitable to drill based on their cost of capital. and they're going to want to take advantage of the policies in place uh to get more rigs in production uh ahead of the risk of a different type of regime coming into play. Get it in now, get it going uh even if it's at break even or slightly unprofitable and NOV will be there to provide them uh all the services that they need in order to make that happen both onshore and offshore. So we we love that. We you know we looked a lot if you look at the underweight positioning of managers etc. We we're trying to find ways to express that in energy and candidly I don't think enough of the ENTP companies have come down in price enough relative to uh the price of crude how how much that's come down. Uh so I I kept looking at the underweight and seeing that there just wasn't any opportunity that I was there wasn't enough margin of safety in the exploration and production names in the serer names I see huge opportunity. So even if the price drops more uh with a company like NOV Inc. Uh the margin of safety is such that I don't have to worry about it and if it goes against me before it doubles and triples we'll buy more. >> Got it. But listeners, if you're watching this, uh, you have any\n\ndvice. Uh, and these are the type of things that we look for. Our downsides protected because their balance sheet income statement is is is solid. They're they're generating a ton of free cash flow to service the small amount of relative debt that they have.

But listeners, if you're watching this, uh, you have any questions , now's the time to type them in, get a chance to get a few of those answered before we're done. I actually saw one question come through. And that's, uh, uh, Tom, this one says, \"S&P is up about 7 and a half% year to date. Where do and I don't know if you want to sort of take a macro opinion. Where do you see it going for the remainder of the year?\" And the second part of the question was, do you actually have a price target for a name like Gener Stanley Works? SWK. >> Yeah. So, so Stanley, so Generrack, Stanley Black & Decker and QXO, which is Brad Jacobs roll up of uh building supply is is our theme for our housing recovery play and that's going to be a function of rates coming down uh over the next 6 to 12 months. Um, so in in terms of our price targets, uh, we don't publicly say them, but I would say uh, for Stanley Black & Decker, uh, it's at least double from here. Generex got more gas in the tank. Uh, for sure, mid200s, uh, will probably be fully out, mid to high 200s. Um, and we'll trim some along the way, etc. QXO is just getting started. That's going to be an 8 to10 year roll up play that probably goes to $80 to $100 plus with Brad Jacobs. That guy knows how to compound capital. We got in at 12 $12 and change. It quickly went on the beacon. It doubled to 25. Now I think it's at 20. Uh so that could be a four bagger over the next 6 to 8 years from these levels. Maybe five bagger. And he tends to underpromise and overd deliver. So he'll probably have some rabbits he pulls out of the hat. He's an awesome. So, so we look for these themes and and what you can see from uh from the themes is we buy when they're out of favor, when they're not in the\n\nquestions , now's the time to type them in, get a chance to get a few of those answered before we're done. I actually saw one question come through. And that's, uh, uh, Tom, this one says, \"S&P is up about 7 and a half% year to date. Where do and I don't know if you want to sort of take a macro opinion. Where do you see it going for the remainder of the year?\" And the second part of the question was, do you actually have a price target for a name like Gener Stanley Works? SWK. >> Yeah. So, so Stanley, so Generrack, Stanley Black & Decker and QXO, which is Brad Jacobs roll up of uh building supply is is our theme for our housing recovery play and that's going to be a function of rates coming down uh over the next 6 to 12 months. Um, so in in terms of our price targets, uh, we don't publicly say them, but I would say uh, for Stanley Black & Decker, uh, it's at least double from here. Generex got more gas in the tank.

And he tends to underpromise and overd deliver. So he'll probably have some rabbits he pulls out of the hat. He's an awesome. So, so we look for these themes and and what you can see from uh from the themes is we buy when they're out of favor, when they're not in the headlines , when people aren't talking about them, and we sell when they start to be in the news every day and become the new shiny objects of tomorrow and people can't get enough, we help them out and lay off the shares. As far as the S&P 500, look, we're in a seasonally weak part. It wouldn't surprise me to see 3 to 5% pullbacks consolidate some of the gains. uh but I think we resolve higher into year end. So, uh, it wouldn't surprise me to see us, you know, if we go back to 62, 6,100, uh, that we don't finish the year at, you know, 6600, 60,6650, 6700 type type of thing because, uh, you still have 14% earnings growth next year. You still have a lot of opportunity on the surface. I do think if you're exclusively in indices or the companies that have already moved a lot or that everyone's crowded into, I think you're going to underperform. This goes back to the conversation. It's not an eitheror, it's a both end. They mag 7 can go up from here. I think they will go up less on a relative basis than those lagards that people have to chase to catch their benchmarks and keep their jobs uh and those stocks that uh haven't moved as much that are going to be the the leaders for the second half of 2025. So so that's how I would think about it. Um, so it doesn't mean you you have to get out of one set of companies just because the others. It just means you might lighten up a little bit one group and start to add some of the other group that you you're underexposed. Got it. A question for on just came in actually. It says, \"Do you think if oil drops to say $50, then do you think the tech technicals will push the riskless or fundamental price much lower than 13?\" >> I could care less. We'll be buyers. I hope I hope oil falls to 40 and we can buy a ton of stock at $8. Uh because if I look three to five years out, I've got, you know, 40 $50 stock. So, if I get to buy more at eight, I'd be super happy about that. I don't I don't think about or even worry about the the short-term voting machine based on emotions or $50 oil. Uh I think that benefits National Oil Wellvarco as a leader in what they do. It would hurt its competitors more than it would hurt it because it's got the strongest balance sheet. It's got the greatest expertise. It's got the highest install base. Uh and and their business profitability is less dependent on the price of oil because of the existing stall install base and the servicing. So it's not without risk to the price of oil, but it's lower risk, which is why we chose to express our interest in out of favor energy through uh through this particular company because of uh accounting for the possibility of lower oil prices in the short term. >> Got it. Well, I think that's the last question that I saw come in and my my watch is about to say we're kind of at the the end of our time here, but Tom, thank you so much honestly for joining in this discussion. viewers, if if you're listening to this again, check out hedge fund tips. Check out some of the work Tom does. Uh you'll see him on TV as well, talking about, you know, some of just a different way of thinking about investing. Uh really thinking about the types of investors that have won long term that have those track records. It's in the value space and he's got the numbers to prove it. So Tom, thank you so much for sharing your insights and your picks and look forward to talking again in the future. >> Appreciate it. Thanks so much, Mike. >> Take care. And we're back. ### MEDIA_APPEARANCE_RECAP\nUh, and then I had the pleasure of joining Liz on CNA Asia, which is like the BBC of Asia. Huge channel. Thanks to Marian Star In also thanks obviously to David Lynn and thanks uh especially to Andrew Keys for joining us on that uh great explanation of Ethereum. Uh, and this was general market. >> Thomas Hayes uh, chairman and managing member Greatill Capital joins us for more now. Thomas, thanks for your time this morning. So, markets have been pretty much on a choppy ride. Uh, and this latest pullback has been attributed to the weaken than expected uh services data as well as new tariff comments from the president on the farmer and uh the semicon sectors. I mean, how would you characterize the current state of the market? >> Well, we've had an enormous move off the lows, Liz, some 30%. So, we're consolidating gains and we're moving into a seasonably weak part of the year. Usually, August, September, and early October have a little bit of volatility. So, it's natural to have some consolidation. However, I wouldn't get too bearish because you have too many managers that are behind the benchmark and every dip of 3 to 5% will be bought. The question is is where are they going to put that money? And are they going to put that money in uh Magnificent 7 which has already moved a lot and has shown while they had good earnings that their earnings growth is decelerating. As a matter of fact, Q3 will be the first quarter that Magnificent 7 earnings are 10% or below 10%. That's down from 33% last year. Or like you saw today, the only index that was up was the small cap index. Are managers going to buy the lagards, the the small caps and the most shorted stocks, which has have actually outperformed the indices? The most shorted stocks have outperformed the indices by 11% in the last 6 to 7 weeks. So, I think what you're going to see is volatility, short-term consolidation at the index level, which is predominantly magnificent 7, and real opportunity and real buying starting to happen under the surface for the unmagnificent 493. the remainder of the S&P 500 and small caps. And now that you saw the odds of a cut in September going over 90% today after the largest revision in jobs data in 50 years that we saw on Friday. I think it uh points to things to be constructive moving forward uh as you look out 3 to 6 months even if you get a little chop in the next 3 to 6 weeks. >> Right. Gotcha. So I just want to take a look at some of the uh reasons for this uh dip in market moves overnight and one of that was the ISM services data which showed uh weakening activity but persistent price pressures. I mean with services sector representing quite a significant part of the US economy in fact 70%. I mean how are you viewing this stagnation especially as also we're seeing uh the data showing slowing jobs growth. Yeah, there's no question the Fed needs to cut or they're going to be it is going to be a question of too late Powell. But what you've seen for the last couple of years is you had this huge pull forward of goods during COVID and then everyone got loaded up with goods and we went to uh aggressive service spending while good spending fell and now you're seeing a a resumption of goods overtaking services. So yes, t\n\nMagnificent 7 which has already moved a lot and has shown while they had good earnings that their earnings growth is decelerating. As a matter of fact, Q3 will be the first quarter that Magnificent 7 earnings are 10% or below 10%. That's down from 33% last year.

But what you've seen for the last couple of years is you had this huge pull forward of goods during COVID and then everyone got loaded up with goods and we went to uh aggressive service spending while good spending fell and now you're seeing a a resumption of goods overtaking services. So yes, t### MEDIA_APPEARANCE_RECAP\nhere is  a bit of softness in in the the services data, but goods and consumer discretionary are starting to pick up. As a matter of fact, earnings growth estimates coming into this quarter in the United States for the S&P 500 were just 4.8%. Well, with 2thirds of the S&P having reported, we're over 10% earnings growth and earnings estimates for the year have actually gone up not only for 2025 in the last few weeks, but also for 2026. Uh, expecting S&P 500 to come in at about $31 of earnings per share. So, on balance, it's it's mixed. Softening employment is clear. uh Fed Powell is too restrictive, but uh with the resignation of Cougler and uh Powell uh term running out May of next year, you're going to basically have four of the uh seven governors uh moving in the direction of more dovish policy and the market starting to sniff that out. and you add a little dovish policy, you bring borrowing rates down and this business, this uh economy is going to fly because uh consumers balance sheets are very underlevered. They have trillions in home equity that can be drawn once rates come down. We can relever the private sector. The public se sector obviously is overlevered. We need to to handle that and Trump is trying to do that partially with tariffs, partially with growth. uh but the public sector has really a lot of room to move once rates start to come down. So I think you're going to see a snap back after some short-term uh consolidation for sure. >> Right. But something that could throw a spanner in the works um appears to be or possibly could be um the imminent tariffs on semiconductors and pharmaceuticals especially for pharmaceuticals. I mean, the president's talked about, you know, the taxes on that going up to possibly 250%. And and so, how much of an impact do you think that could pose to inflation? Um, and also what does this mean for markets, especially um in the sectors of tech and healthcare? I mean, should these uh measures be enacted, which the president said could come in a week or so? >> Yeah, this is the way President Trump negotiates. in case you haven't gotten the memo. What he does is he punches people in the face and then he offers them an ice pack and they're happy for the ice pack. So he goes in for the big ask. This is a huge ask. He's doing the same thing with India. He's doing the same thing with Canada. And if they don't cooperate and they don't come to the table to negotiate, you know what? They get hit again in the face until they\n\n softening employment is clear. uh Fed Powell is too restrictive, but uh with the resignation of Cougler and uh Powell uh term running out May of next year, you're going to basically have four of the uh seven governors uh moving in the direction of more dovish policy and the market starting to sniff that out. and you add a little dovish policy, you bring borrowing rates down and this business, this uh economy is going to fly because uh consumers balance sheets are very underlevered.

This is a true up uh it's interesting the board said that we needed to give him this grant to keep him focused on Tesla. I mean he's got 13% of a trillion dollar company. That's 130 billion round numbers close to half of his net worth. I don't know that he needs that to keep him focused on Tesla, but maybe they need to keep him in the picture. Uh, and that's exactly what they're doing here. I mean, with the EV tax credits going away, you're seeing the big three pivot away from EVs towards hybrids and ex uh Chinese EV companies. I think Tesla is going to be the the last man standing. Uh, and they do need Elon Musk and they do need to pivot the company towards humanoid robots and towards robo taxis for it to continue to grow into its current valuation cuz uh the EV numbers haven't been great and they're not going to get much better. >> Thomas, what bothers me about this is um so Elon may stay until 2027.

Elon Musk is Tesla. You take him out of the picture, all that premium goes away. He's the innovator. He's the guy who slept on the factory. He's the guy who took it out of bankruptcy. He's the guy who got the government to give him all the subsidies. Without Elon, candidly, I don't think there is a Tesla.\n\n### MISCELLANEOUS\nEquities XUS are up 16% and change 16 17% S&P up 6%. There's a lot of spend going on with Magnificent 7. Earnings growth was about 14% for MAG7 that has reported but that's down from 33% earnings growth last year and next quarter will be the first quarter that earnings growth for MAG 7 actually goes below 10% but the multiples haven't contracted so if you look at Amazon 31 times PE with low double digits earnings growth you look at Microsoft 30 31% 31 times PE with 8% earnings growth so you're seeing the earnings growth compress as they spend more and more on capex. With the weight of the MAG 7 and the S&P 500, you're going to continue to see some international outperformance in the back half of the year.\n\nWe're waiting for that return on on investments, but the multiples haven't contracted yet. So, I do think with the weight of the MAG 7 and the S&P 500, you're going to continue to see some international outperformance in the back half of the year. The other thing that we've seen in the last month, month and a half, has been two themes. smaller and high short entrance has uh short interest has outperformed the S&P 500 by 11 full percentage points in the last 67 weeks and I think that's going to continue and the reason is is all dips have to be bought. So many managers sold in the hole over a trillion dollar of equity selling in the beginning part of April and they haven't caught up to their indices. So they've got to chase that performance and they can't chase what's already up a lot. they've got to buy those things that haven't yet moved and those are largely smaller stocks uh which are which are the most shorted right now. And if you look at earnings growth for next year, small cap earnings growth is going to be 37% versus the S&P 500 earnings growth expected to be about 14%. So you basically get more than double the earnings growth for a lower multiple. I think that's where things have to go and things are going to go that direction as rates come down. I think now the writing is on the wall with the jobs report that you referenced. The Fed has to move and the and the Fed odds are up to 87.4% of a cut in September. Look for that pivot at Jackson Hole in August. \n### QUOTES_OF_THE_WEEK\nGreat investment opportunities come around when excellent companies are surrounded by unusual circumstances that cause the stock to be misappraised. That's from Warren Buffett. And that is the core theme. you know, uh, most companies have a vision, mission, you know, DEI statement or some grandiose thing like save the world. This is our mission statement at Great Hill Capital. Great investment opportunities come around when excellent companies are surrounded by unusual circumstances that cause the stock to be misappraised. And what we do for clients every day is find those opportunities and not only take advantage of them, but express them in a unique way where we can get exceptional returns from boring companies with predictability and allocate meaningful amounts of cash because we're not trying to guess the future or gamble on someone coming in to to buy the last tick up when when something's trading at a 100 times sales like we talked about with with David. So, uh so that's that. next Peter Lynch. You get recessions, you have stock market declines. If you don't understand that's going to happen, then you're not ready. You won't do well in the markets. And I think a lot of people uh listen to the podcast over time. And many of them give me money because they've made a lot of money. And the other portion of people that give me money um are those who realize they don't want to do this. Number one, and they can't do that. They don't have the composition uh and the patience and the understanding to sit through that. And that makes perfect sense because I don't do brain surgery. I'm not a lawyer. Uh I'm not a scientist. I'm not a computer scientist. I mean that Ethereum stuff. Woo. You know, I mean, I could spend years studying that and think I had competency and uh I'm sure Andrew would be like, \"Yeah, you still don't know what the hell you're talking about.\" And and and I would accept that. And that's why I allocate to someone who is the best in that space that I can trust, that I know is a winner, that is a winning jockey. And that's why people allocate to Great Hill Capital, and we're very grateful for that. Uh here's some\n\n### QUOTES_OF_THE_WEEK\nWarren Buffett.

Mortgage rates uh lower than they've been in a while. Semiconductor index up against some little bit of resistance. Probably test back to this level. Uh but here's what's interesting. As the rates have rolled back over, what's happening to the housing index, home builder index is going straight up, which is a core theme that we are playing through Generrack, which is, you know, nearly doubled off its recent lows now in a handful of weeks. QXO has been up quite a bit from our basis. And then, uh, Stanley is starting to recover aggressively. So, we're excited about all that. You know, you just got to deal with the tariff noise on a day-to-day basis while they mitigate it, etc.\n### MACRO_DATA_SLIDES\nLabor market slowed sharply over the past three months. I'm not a huge fan of tariffs, okay? it's going to work out because of the way they've done it. But I don't I wouldn't have gone about it in that specific way. But it is what it is. You you got to play the hand that you're dealt versus being an idealist. It should be this way. It should be that way. I don't care how it should be. I care how it is. And then how am I going to win based on the hand that I'm dealt?\n\nSemiconductor index up against some little bit of resistance. Probably test back to this level. Uh but here's what's interesting.

You know, you just got to deal with the tariff noise on a day-to-day basis while they mitigate it, etc. All right, let's get to data. Labor market slowed sharply over the past three months. You know, I was reading some of the comments in uh David Lynn's video from from those folks, and they the takeaway I got from some of the comments, and I probably shouldn't read the comments, but uh I'm always entertained by them, was that they think my view on rates has to do with politics. And I think for those of you who have been around long enough, um, number one, probably for many years, you couldn't tell whether I was Republican or Democrat anyway. Uh, which is a good thing because we're here to talk about business. Um, and number two, I call him as I see him. I mean, this whole thing with Lip Bhutan is, uh, complete disaster and a stupid decision by the administration. So, I I'll call him exactly how I see him. Uh, I'm not a huge fan of tariffs, okay? it's going to work out because of the way they've done it. But I don't I wouldn't have gone about it in that specific way. But it is what it is. You you got to play the hand that you're dealt versus being an idealist. It should be this way. It should be that way. I don't care how it should be. I care how it is. And then how am I going to win based on the hand that I'm dealt? So um so when I talk about cutting rates with housing as 16% of GDP that's material with the cracks in the labor market and### MACRO_DATA_SLIDES\nhere is  the labor market and by the way the multi-month revisions were the highest in downward in 50 years and this guy is asleep at the wheel. And the reason that, you know, and you'll you'll see in some of their comments, they're like, \"Oh, the stock market's at all-time highs. Uh, you know, prices are still up. What's he talking about uh cutting rates?\" Because when this turns, you can't fix it the way you can fix it if you're wrong and you cut too soon and you can raise 25, 50, 75 basis points, get inflation back under control. Getting deflation under control is so costly and so painful in terms of the jobs lost. And once fear starts, it compounds aggressively that it it can't be uh fixed very quickly. So that's why I talk in those terms, not in terms of a political view or uh anything else. The other thing that you should keep in mind is um this is something that people aren't talking about and you're going to hear it first. interest rates on government debt is consuming 17% of government spending. Okay, we we kind of know that. Everyone knows that. Here's something that you probably don't hear every day. Keeping rates artificially high creates an environment where the traditional inflating fighting tool, higher interest rates, can over time become inflationary itself. Higher rates raise interest payment costs which are then financed with more government borrowing. Without the offset of higher taxes or lower spending, the debt grows. More money is pumped into the economy in the form of treasury securities. On net, public receives more income. So the higher rates eventually become a form of stimulus, driving up demand and prices. And that's the thing that people aren't talking about is the four and a half percent in money markets that people are making tons of money and you say well why let them make their money they need fixed income etc. Um but that in effect is a self-fulfilling prophecy and when you have government spending 17% on interest payments you can't afford that. So when Trump talks about um we are paying you know he says we should cut 300 basis points that's crazy but that's what Trump does. He does this you know he asks for two or three times what he thinks is realistic and then he gets 100 basis points or 150 basis points which is probably right. I think a 100 would be enough. Um even 75 would actually be enough. Uh and that would, you know, 100 basis points would cut interest payments by $300 billion a year. That does an awful lot for the deficit. Uh 200 basis points would be 600 billion. He's asking for, you know, 300 basis points would be which would be a trillion. That's a big big deal. Uh so I I I don't think people are thinking enough about the double-edged sword that high interest rates can actually be inflationary itself because of the increased issuance to service that excess 600 or $900 billion of unnecessary interest rate payments and the additional income. uh that it's basically like giving out stimulus checks for everyone who has fixed income securities or a checking account that's earning interest. Uh so it's something to be uh very mindful of. Healthcare S&P 500 weight uh guys this is again these are generational opportunities when you have health care uh at the percentage weight of the S&P 500. I remember we did charts like this during COVID when energy was like 1 or 2% of the S&P waiting down from 9% and we were buying uh Exxon Mobile till the cows come home in the low30s when oil was trading negative and the waiting was 2% and people were getting fired in pensions if they owned energy stocks and everyone said it was all over and then boom it just completely doubled and tripled. Um, healthc care is at that right now. Uh, certainly biotech exposure is going to be good. Baxter, it looks like it's bottomed here, which is exciting because we were able to buy an unbelievable amount. Uh, and we covered it in this week's article. Um, uh, in the low 20s. So, that's exciting. And bring our basis down. Uh, year three of bull markets can be choppy. This is from Carson, but you can see we are early in a secular bull. I discussed that with David.

So, um, you know, I I actually had someone text me and said, you can't make this stuff up. I mean, um, they said, I think you're wrong on small caps because over the last, hold on, I'll read it. I mean, I over the last 11 weeks or 12 weeks, the S&P is up 12% off the lows and small caps are only up 11%. I I I can't help people like that. Um, but um they exist, so it is what it is.

Uh what we try to do here is  we try to skate to where the puck is going. And um when it turns, it turns all at once. So what is a 1 or 2% underperformance the last however many weeks will be 30 to 40% outperformance over the next 20 40 months. And uh and then they'll say what happened and they'll be the ones that got phase planted because they were chasing stocks at 100 times sales that fell 75% because they missed one quarter by 3%. So, um, but if if if people like that didn't exist, we would be out of a job because emotional people are what creates the opportunities for us to buy incredibly beautiful, boring, durable businesses at exceptional prices and then just wait for them to revert to the mean over time uh and and outperform in that regard.

So, um, moving on,### MACRO_DATA_SLIDES\nhere is  the US flash report automotive sales, uh, by month. They crushed it in July relative to last year and the year before. Pretty much one, two, three, four, five out of the last seven months has been a big outperformance from the year before. So when you see Cooper Sander taking down industry volumes because of the wherever they get their data from S&P uh has taken it down, I think that will wind up being too conservative and I think their guidance as a result will wind up being too conservative and that's what we want is massive upside surprises like we saw in the most recent quarter. Um, US consumer confidence. These are times when it pays to be a buyer, not a seller. Markets don't have secular tops when consumer confidence is this low. They have secular tops when it's super high, like 200 um 2006, 2021. Uh this is the lowest it's been since the 2009 and 2011 lows, the debt crisis and the great financial crisis. And then going back from there, you have to go back to 1979 and 1974, which were major lows. So, we like this setup.

Let's go over to some um\n### MISCELLANEOUS\nSloomer stuff because he does a good job here uh illustrating what I've been talking about for a long time, the last five years about being in a secular bull, which I now think we're about halfway through. And this will resolve probably in the early 2030s. And you can see here going back a hundred years you got 15 20 years of sideways consolidation in the 30s followed by 15 20 years of straight up in from the ' 50s to the late60s early '7s then 17 years of sideways consolidation in the 70s to early 80s and uh from 1980 to 2000 again 17 years straight up sideways consolidation from 2000 to 2015 and Now we are uh 2015 to 2025. We're about probably 607 60% of the way through and this cycle would uh end in 2023 uh 2033 2034 2035. Uh this doesn't preclude 20% corrections, but the trend is up and we've talked about the demographic um underpinnings that support that and that continues to be our base case. So, I think we're going to continue to make exceptional amounts of money in a relatively short period of time. And in the early 2030s, we will start to aggressively lighten up, build cash, build shorts, um uh and and and be preparing for one of what will be one of the greatest generational buy opportunities uh in history. But in the meantime, we're halfway up the mountain. Uh there's so much opportunity. It's insane. You know, I was I was nervous this quarter that uh there wasn't going to be enough opportunity because a lot of money came in and I have had zero problems, zero anxiety putting money to to work this quarter. There's like unbelievable opportunities and um I'm just super super excited for our clients and uh and for the back half of the year. So a repetitive 3 to four year cycle driven by central bank liquidity and economic growth. Uh so you can see here same type of thing uh how this is natural. The bias is up. That doesn't preclude 3 to 5 to 10% pullbacks. Uh I don't think we're going to get a 20% again anytime soon. We've had three in the last uh five years. Uh that pulled forward 10.5 years of bare market corrections. Um so all dips are to be bought or sit on your hands and wait through them and don't worry about whether you outperformed or underperformed in the last 5 days or 5 weeks. You think in terms of 3 to 5 years you are going to be crushing it. Okay. And um bullish sentiment again not at extreme kind of mid-range. uh MSCI EF breaking out. That's international. Europe up against this level. Does it go back and retest before breaking out? We don't know. We'll we'll see. Uh doesn't really matter. Here's the 10-year cycle peak. Hit this high high level. 10-year yield. Probably goes back to the top of this line, not below this line. Um 10-year 30-year, which we discussed. Here's the US dollar. It's amazing. Everyone's panicking that the US dollar is going to hell and it's going to go away and everything else. It's still super strong relative to history. It would be natural for it to break this trend line and and go lower and lower over the next few years before resuming its next uptrend. And right now, I think we are in a downtrend. We'll have these counter trend rallies, but the dollar is going to continue to weaken, which helps international, also helps US earnings. The Canadian dollar, everyone was um apoplelectic, scared about the looney. I said, my Canadian friends, uh have no fear. The the strong looney is here. It started to happen. It's early days. So, if you have loonies, I would not be trading them out. I would be hoarding them like nobody's business. you are going to be having massive purchasing power over the next few years. Uh gold that seems to have topped out. We'll see how that plays out. And people say, well, how can you have a view that dollar weakens and gold tops out? And the answer is it's happened many times in history. Zoom out. Uh crude, you know, crude is uh continues to be in a downtrend. Does this stop at the 40s? Does it stop at 66 before going up? The answer is we don't know. I think that um the types of businesses that we're in, the margin of safety is large enough. We've got National Oil Well, Varco, which we love. The balance sheet cash flow less sensitive to price. Comtock Resources has done its back and fill. We were buying some for new clients this week while uh some of you were puking it out.

We'll probably have a deal and a handshake between Xi and Trump which will help that group. They're kind of in a waiting pattern waiting for that. as it relates uh we'll we'll deal with the intel thing, but as it relates to him with Lip Bhutan, I think it's incumbent upon Lip Bhutan to get on the PJ and uh or the CJ, the corporate jet, and go to Washington. I don't know what the hell he's been doing. Trump keeps talking about manufacturing in the US, and he's sitting in uh Irvine over here. I should go knock on his door and be like, \"Let's go, you know, uh let's go. Let's go see the Wizard, the wonderful Wizard of Oz, and and make a deal. I mean, the company, I'm sure, vetted him pretty aggressively as it relates to China ties. Um, you know, look, maybe maybe uh maybe Trump wants Kevin Hasset to run Intel. At least they would get a lot of deals done from the government. But I mean, it's amazing looking at the stock today. It's completely horrible news and the stock really isn't breaking down. And it tells you that it's just like it's so bad that it's good that if they liquidate the whole company today, you get back 20 21 $22. Uh and uh and if they don't, you know, and they fail on the fabs, you get $40, $50 over time. And if the fabs actually work and they do a deal and uh Lip Bhutan or they bring Gellzinger back or Bessant goes to run Intel, who the hell knows? Uh and they bring him a nice little round crystal uh Intel statue with a gold-plated uh base like uh Tim Cook does. all of a sudden they're going to get, you know, hundreds of billions of dollars of government support and contracts because they need to manufacture in the US and Intel is the only way to do that. I don't think they're going to subsidize Taiwan semiconductor to the same extent that they're willing to subsidize Intel to get what they need. So Trump says getting very close on extending trade China trade truce. I think this morning they said they were going to give them another extension. China's national team perfects the art of dip buying. You see here they they've been stepping in the market, supporting the market. So your bottom is in. Then now the question is what's the next catalyst to the upside? I think it's earnings. I think it's a deal. Disney's Thriving Parks are buying it. Time to figure out streaming. Uh streaming was actually better than expected as well. Disney's ESPN to acquire NFL media assets and major deal. GXO Logistics post higher second quarter revenue on new contracts. This one's ripping back from the dead. We're excited about that. We'll cover Disney. We'll cover GXO next week. Jeff, make a note. Diagio, Left for Dead. You know what I love about all these names? Uh Disney. GXO. No one's talking about them. And uh uh Dagio up huge the last week. No one's talking about it. This thing's going to continue to run. Best-in-class premiumization story. Dio Dagio sores on sales growth, cost cuts, offset tariff hit. Uh, not in anyone's on anyone's bingo card and early early days, no one talking about it. Dagio's new chief signals a spirited turnaround planned. Canada goose sales defy customer gloom as demand holds steady, CEO says. Um, again on no one's bingo cards, Christian Crown Castle names Christian Hillbrand as new CEO. He's fantastic. huge experience in global tower business. Three Fed officials voice fresh concerns over US labor market. The disscent is happening. Uh by the way, uh Powell is going to wind up neutered if Trump makes this key chess move and puts Kevin Hasset into Phil Cougler's place in August on the Fed Board of Governors. And then he also says Hasset will sit on the board of governors until Powell steps down uh voluntarily in May or involuntarily beforehand. And uh not only is he on the board of governors, but he is our chairperson in waiting. Shadowfed initiated. Powell lame duck initiated. Game over. Then rates are going to start to come down big. Real estate's going to start to boom. And I think the home building uh index is um starting to reflect that. You heard it here first. We said that was going to happen a couple of weeks ago. Now it's happening. I couldn't have predicted Cougler step stepping down. So luck, you know, sometimes better to be lucky than to be good. But if Hasset's the guy, it's game over. And then you're going to have Judy Shelton come on for the next vacancy and uh and Hasset be the Fed chair and off to the races. Uh the spoiler would be Wsh because Wsh is historically a hawk and now he's pretending to be a dove. Uh kind of a wolf in sheep's clothing which is what you saw with uh to a lesser extent Powell and then they do what they want.

Return of boring stock market and sentiment results\n\n### HEADLINES_AND_NEWS\nstock market and sentiment results\n\n### FEATURED_COMPANY_DEEP_DIVES\nBaxter, our sleepy medical device pick, reported what we would call a textbook definition of a kitchen sink quarter last week. take all the medicine at once and set the stage for new CEO Andrew Haidider to walk in like a hero, suddenly having the mightest touch for a business that has gone nowhere but down for years. There were two shots of medicine in the Q2 report that spooked the market and led to a fullear guidance cut. First, management voluntarily paused shipments and installations of its Noam IQ infusion platform to work with customers and address feedback. Noam was Baxter's shiny new product with strong backlog already taking nearly two points of market share annually and a key driver behind the 6% growth in the MPT segment last quarter. Second, hospital IV fluid conservation efforts have lingered longer than expected following hurricane Helen and the North Cove recovery, delaying a return to historical norms. Combined, these overhangs led management to lower full f fullyear sales guidance from four to 5% growth to 3 to 4% growth and trim EPS guidance from a range of 247 to 255 down to 245 to 252. So basically, you know, 252 down to 247, the stock sells off 30%. That for me is opportunity of the a lifetime. Okay, so we've been stuffing as much as we could. Same with VFC Corp. Same with Intel. No change in any of those. And National Oil Well Varco. By the way, uh in markets, Mr. Market's eyes, that was enough to knock the stock down over 20%. You can't make this up. We had a much different reaction in the news. In fact, we will be mailing Christmas cards for the next couple of years to those who handed over their shares of Baxter uh hovers at 19 years lows. Not only are both headwinds temporary, but this guidance is what we call the morticians forecast for the back half of the year. Aka, this was sandbagging at its finest. Take the fluid conservation story. Management has already seen improvement and expects more into the back half and into 2026. Yet, their outlook assumes zero recovery this year. And even if hospitals remain cautious, these IV fluid customers have minimum volume commitments. Either they buy more or they pay more. Then there's a NOM IQ pause. The low end of the guidance now assumes it stays off the market through year end. This is despite management aiming to resume shipments as soon as possible and the decision to pause being completely voluntary. There was no FDA mandate and no requirement for a permanent fix. Even so, they chose to model zero contribution from their most important new product through year end. Here's how we see it potentially playing out. Andrew Haidider steps in this September. By his first or second earnings call, Q4, Q1, Baxter will suddenly report that Novam IQ is shipping again and flying off the shelves. Meanwhile, fluid conservation trends have magically improved. Haidider will be hailed as a miracle worker, and the turnaround will suddenly feel obvious overnight, tomorrow's newspaper today. But really, this is all just short-term noise. The big picture turnaround remains well on track. Priority number one was cleaning up the balance sheet and that box is checked. Selling the kidney care business for 3.8 billion not only brought leverage down to a projected three times by year end, it also got rid of the slowest growth and lowest margin segment of the portfolio, which means the multiple caner rate. Now it's all about execution. And the good news is this isn't the type of business that needs to reinvent the wheel. This is IV bags, pumps, hospital beds, etc. are boring, stable, and predictable. And that's Andrew Haidider's bread and butter. During his time as CEO of ATS, a company that designs and manufactures automated systems and equipment, the stock hit a peak of 5x from when he joined after just 6 years at the helm. Before that, he learned from the best at Danaher. In the case of Baxter, we think a couple clean quarters of solid execution and proof that they can get back to the four to 5% growth rate will go a long way. Management still sees a clear path back to high teens operating margins and has already made solid progress improve improving the trough of 14.3% in 2023 to 15 to 16% this year. Once it becomes obvious obvious we expect the market to reward that progress with a meaningful rerating. Baxter currently trades at just nine times earnings, the lowest we have seen since 2003 when the company was dealing with patient deaths linked to contaminated dialysis machines. That's not funny, but it's funny that the multiple is that low considering we're dealing with nothing like that at the moment. A move back towards sector average and Baxter's own historical 16 to 17 times multiple feels inevitable once the dust settles. Until then, we sit on our hands, collect the dividend, and simply let the story play out. Sooner or later, boring will be beautiful and Baxter wins that prize all day long. So, we underlined and highlighted all the most important aspects of the results and all the most important aspects of the earnings call as well as highlighting the top 10 takeaways which you can go to hedge funfundtips.com and read on your own. Now, on to Stanley Black & Decker rebounding off the lows liberation day lows. Um and you can see here margins starting to reacelerate, cash flows remaining positive and strong uh despite the tariff headwind in the short term and the business re accelerating in terms of cash flow per share uh reacelerating in terms of um earnings per share etc. So despite headline numbers that crushed expectations reporting adjusted earnings of 1.08 08 per share versus 42 cents. Consensus and revenue of 3.95 billion in line with estimates. Stanley Black & Decker's solid second quarter and continued progress in the turnaround were overshadowed by the market's tariff tantrum tariff tantrum turning what was fundamentally a strong print into what looked like a weak quarter. Management guided to a potential $800 million annualized impact from tariffs in 2025, which hit the single most important metric in the turnaround story, which is gross margins. margins fell to 27.5% in Q2, down 170 basis points year-on-year, with 3% of that tied directly to tariff pressure. Those two numbers were all the market needed to write off this quarter as an ugly one. But when you actually do the work under the surface, it is nowhere near as bad as Mr. Market's knee-jerk reaction would suggest. That $800 million doomsday figure excludes any mitigation actions. Excludes any mitigation actions which are already well underway. management implemented an initial price increase back in April with demand remaining consistent post increase and another modest increase is planned for early Q4. They're also working to improve USMCA compliance where possible and plan to reduce their China manufacturing footprint to under 5% by the end of 2026. These steps are expected to reduce the actual tariff impact to just 60 to 65% of the 800 million. For those of you not good with math, that's about $300 million less. Most importantly, management expects pricing and mitigation to largely offset the entire tariff headwind by 2026. Again, most importantly, management expects pricing and mitigation to largely offset the entire tariff headwind by 2026, not 2029, 2026. That sets up Q2 gross margins as an inflection point for the year. Both Q3 and Q4 are expected to show 152 north of 200 basis points of year-over-year margin expansion with Q4 margins landing in the 34 33 to 34% range. That puts Stanley Black & Decker just a hair shy of its long-term target above 35%. A level management expects to reach in the second half of 2026. Not 2036. 2026. Keep in mind, the last time this business had gross margins above 35%, it generated $85 in EPS and traded north of $150 a share. It's in the 60s right now, ladies and gentlemen. And by the way, none of this recovery depends on volume. This is pure cost-driven margin improvement. No market rebound, no operating leverage, just execution. But when the market does turn, and it's inevitable, Stanley Black & Decker will be a cash machine. Tariffs don't change the multi-million dollar using unit housing shortage caused by a decade plus of underbuilding. They don't change demographics with over 70 million millennials entering prime family formation for years. And they don't change this administration's laser focus on cutting red tape and improving housing. Ladies and gentlemen, when rates come down and housing wakes up from the dead, it will suddenly become the new shiny object of the object trade of the market. And this beach ball that has been held underwater will explode higher. We skate to where the puck is going, not to where it's already been. It is only a matter of time.\n\nmanagement expects pricing and mitigation to largely offset the entire tariff headwind by 2026.

It is only a matter of time.\n\n### FEATURED_COMPANY_DEEP_DIVES\nVF Corp. Some of the key highlights. Uh we're probably going to go into more detail on this in the very near future, but here were the 10 key takeaway points. Number one, Q1 revenues of 1.8 billion down 2% year-over-year beat consensus by 59.85 million and came in ahead of prior guidance for a decline of 3 to 5% adjusted loss per share of.24 was10 uh 10 cents better than analyst expectation and compares to a loss of 35 cents in the same period last year. Two adjusted gross margins for the quarter came in at 54.1% up 200 basis points year-over-year and well ahead of the 52.1% consensus estimates driven by higher quality inventory lower discounts and favorable FX. This resulted in an adjusted operating loss of just 56 million, a significant improvement over prior guidance calling for a loss between 125 million and 110 million. Q2 gross margins are expected to remain broadly flat with adjusted operating income projected in the range of 260 million to 290 million. Fully year operating income is still expected to grow compared to last year's 556 million. Most importantly, the fiscal 2028 targets of 55% gross margins and 10% operating margins remain well on track. Number three, as we like to say, the number one thing we want to see in any turnaround is free cash flow recovering. Management still expects free cash flow to be up versus last year's 313 million even after accounting for tariff impacts and excluding the sale of non-core assets. Number four, net debt was down $1.4 billion or 20% compared to last year as management remains on track to achieve the medium-term leverage target of 2.5 times by fiscal year 2028. VFC ended last year at 4.1 times and expects to be below that by the end of this fiscal year with the $500 million bond expected to be paid down at the end of at year end using free cash flow and other short-term borrowing if needed. Five. Northace continues to deliver solid growth up 5% this quarter with strong improvement in overall profitability. Footwear was the standout growing strong double digits with bags and packs also seeing double digit growth. The brand remains on its path to doubling revenue over time as management works to turn it into a four season style brand very similar to what Canada Goose is doing. Next six. Vans revenues for the quarter were down 15% with roughly 40% of the decline driven by deliberate and channel rationaliz deliberate channel rationalization. Excluding that, fans would have been down high single digits. Management continues to see green shoots across the business with America's all sellout trends with America's sellout trends improving as nonvalue accounts grew again this quarter. Appointment bookings at Paris Fashion Week in June were up 50% as the brand leans further into premium product. New styles like the super lowro and current cappell skate which by the way I have the brown current skate and I have the I think I have the low pro. Uh those were the new ones I bought. I got to check on that. I think they're skate low or low pro or something. And also driving strong sales from new products. management optimistic about leaning into back- to-school marketing. An inflection point at Vans may be closer than many expect. I'm seeing more and more around here. I'm I I'm in Orange County, California, so everyone wears Vans. So, uh but um anyway, seven, a key part of the van's turnaround is returning the brand to its root. And it doesn't get much clearer than bringing back the van's warped tour management. By the way, the lady at Laguna Beach Van store when I bought uh the new pair, I asked her like, \"What's, you know, how are volumes?\" And I kind of like tried to lead her to talk negative and said, you know, things been a little slow with Vans, you know, blah blah blah. And she's like, she said, \"No, actually, the the sneakers are selling like crazy.\" So, they have like this pair that I guess is like a sneaker of some sort, like a running sneaker. And I think there's a boot that they have for surfing. Uh, and the puffy things on the side. She's like, \"No, they're selling like crazy.\" So, there you go. Um, again, anecdote. We're we're looking at the data here, but, uh, that's key. So, they did the Vans warp poor warped tour. management planned three locations and expected to sell 50,000 tickets each, which would have been two times any previous single event. They sold out tickets in a matter of hours and over 2 days in Long Beach drew more than 170,000 attendees, making the event a huge boost and catalyst for the brand. Timberland continues to perform well with revenues up 9% during the quarter and higher overall margins driven by lower discounting. The brand saw growth across all channels with America's up 16% year-over-year as management remains more confident than ever about the upside opportunity to break out of Timberland's historic revenue range. 9. Other brands grew 2% during the quarter, led by Altra, which grew 20% year-over-year as it maintained its position as the number one trail running shoe in the US and continued gaining share in road running. When VFC acquired Altra in 2018, the brand was generating 60 million in revenue. This year, it's on track to exceed 250 million as management continues to scale the business. and 10 management expects total annualized tariff impact to be 250 to 270 million with 50% of that flowing through in fiscal year 2026 based on the timing of the expected increases. They anticipate a negative net impact to gross profit this year of 60 to 70 million. Most importantly, management remains confident they can fully mitigate all currently anticipated tariffs in fiscal 2027 with both medium-term margin targets still on track. Again, we underlined all the key points of the earnings call and market sentiment, fear and greed is actually back in the middle of the range at 56. National Association of Active Investment Managers is off the boil. They chased the top. Now they're getting nervous, which means in theory the pain trade could be up. We will see what happens with that possible Fed appointment and or other catalysts. S&P earnings estimates, top 30 weights up 2.12 in the last uh 60 days. 2026 estimates have come up 2.08% in the last 60 days. Russell even bigger upside revisions. top 30 weights in the last 60 days. Up 4% for this year, up just about 3% for next year. Unusual buying in UPS. This is one we've got our eyes on. Very interesting there. Uh looks like they bought the CEO bought uh and director bought one and a half million of shares. They wrote a check. That's good to see any major economic data here. Continuing jobless claims rose. This is why Powell needs to wake up. Initial jobless claims came in worse than expected. Um, etc. Okay, you can see here estimates, the most important thing on earnings are\n\n\nopportunity to break out of Timberland's historic revenue range.

Uh, now up to 301.60. I think it got down to $2.99. You can see them turning abruptly up. We had talked about the first half of the year being the revised down. Second half revised back up.

Uh Nicholas says, \"I spam links to your stuff in all of my group chats.\" uh question on Cooper earning.\n\n### ASK_ME_ANYTHING_QA\n\non Cooper earnings. Should we think about near-term catalyst differently? I think you've generally focused on US AutoSAR, but that forecast was taken down. However, in earnings call, it seems like geographic China volume shift is more important along with potential refinancing, but that's dependent on credit upgrade. Um, it's all about USR. I don't think about short-term. I think about it re I have no control over when it reaches full intrinsic value which I determine before I enter any position. Uh, all I can and some do it way faster than I expect. Hopefully after 12 months so that I don't have to pay short-term capital gains. Most of the time it takes about three years. Uh, so I I don't I don't worry about that short-term noise. I worry about USSAR and if they if USSR recovers as we're seeing with the incentives with everything else we discussed on the um I think it was with David Lyn, no it was probably with Mike Larson. Uh this thing is going to be a cash machine. So everything about Cooper Standard is in that segment. Uh Allan asks about Trump versus Intel. We've covered that. It really doesn't matter as long as they make a deal with the US government and the US government needs them. So, um, we feel comfortable. I like Lip Bhutan. I thought Gellzinger was fine. He was close to the finish line. The board had approved all the spending. The spending went a little bit crazy, but um, it doesn't matter. I I prefer Lip Bhutan. So, hopefully he can get on a plane, bring Trump a plaque, cut a deal, and Intel can double. So, um, use this as a catalyst. probably this is Trump's way of saying like why the hell haven't you come out here like um Jensen Wong, like Tim Cook or Tim Apple. Uh time to get on a plane and and talk. And I think uh I think he's absolutely right. I think Lipu has been so focused on turning around the company, he hasn't thought about the most important customer. Uh and he should go ahead and do that.\n### ASK_ME_ANYTHING_QA\nJohn H asks, \"Morning Tom. Recent listener. Still trying to wrap my head around your turnaround business valuation stubbled upon fossil. thought it might be worth looking at. Uh, let's take a look at Fossil. I generally hate this type of business, but um, as a matter of fact, I don't know if this was during our podcast. No, this was way before I I remember when this thing was trading up around $140. It was some ridiculous valuation. I was like, this thing is a bag of You know what? So, now it's down from 139 down to a buck. Let's see if it's interesting at all. I probably still don't like it a I didn't like it at 139. I probably still don't even like it at a buck. Let's see. Negative free cash flow. Revenues in secular decline. No signs of turnaround. Margins are going up. Um, okay. So, you stopped discounting, but you also stopped selling. So your, you know, your revenues are down 66%. This is a this is I mean it's a cigar butt. Maybe you get one last puff out of it. Let's see what the balance sheet looks like. This is not what we do. So they got 125 million of cash. 160. Okay. So they'll live another day. Their balance sheet is fine. I I don't like this. I mean, can you buy it at a buck and hope it goes to five bucks? Sure. But they better come out with some really amazing watches or get Sydney Sweeney to do some hot ad about wearing fossil watches. Zack Tan, uh, longtime listener, big fan. My question is this. Do you think the administration's policies are benefiting uh, the largest companies disproportionately? No, I think it's just the market's just adjusting to it. I I don't spend a lot of time worrying about policy. I I spend a lot of time worrying about company by company execution and I ignore the short-term price. And all of them are executing on all all four cylinders and um finding their way around the tariff issues and uh it's just a short-term hiccup in a long-term play for massive recovery. Tommy Gardner heard you say a couple episodes getting your CFA is vital. Yeah, it's critical when you're young and you don't know anything and you have no business experience. So yeah, it's uh he goes, \"Is it worth it?\" Of course, it's worth it. I mean, you have nothing else to bring to the table coming out of college. is like, \"Oh, you took a finance course. No one cares.\" So, uh I think that gives you 10 years of experience in two or three years. And uh it just saves you from trial and error and probably gets you uh a better job and um more skilled at um financial analysis in a shorter period of time. Um Jack M be graduating in the spring. Curious on your view of wealth management firms, specifically family family offices. Talking to some other seasoned finance folk. Most said don't start there as it's a hard pivot. Somewhat concentrated. Curious if you had any thoughts on that side of things. Always appreciate the support for younger guys and girls. Um Jack, I would say work for someone that you like and respect where you can learn a lot. Um, if you can get into a big bold, you know, if you went to a good school and you can get into a big firm like Goldman and do their analyst training, that's going to be a huge advantage. If you didn't go to a good school, take what job you can get and work your ass off and prove yourself. Uh, and if that's a family office or wealth management and this is what you want to do with the rest of your life, then start there. Um, you can always pivot. Rachel, okay, invited to a podcast.

Um Jason Zen, I asked several AIs from chat GPT to deep sea to give uh and they all give me a 70% or higher probability that Cooper Standard has the material science and synergy to be a supplier for humanoid robots. Eg. Forrex being used for feet stabilization. thoughts on this being an AI hallucinagated pipe dream or logical expansion being considered by the executive team? Thanks for all you do. I I don't know. It's not in my model. I could care less. I mean, I can forward it on, but if they're in sneakers, they're probably looking at it. That would just be It's not in my underwriting. And what what also wasn't in my initial underwriting is the fact that they're now selling more parts per car with hybrids uh and to a lesser extent EVs. and they make more money per car than I had initially estimated. Uh, which means I probably should take my estimates up, but I like to be conservative. So, as far as humanoid robots, I mean, I I could really care less. I It's just whipped cream, not baked in. Wouldn't bet on it. And um, we'll see what happens. Uh, Lulu, if you want to bet make a bet on humanoid robots, buy Tesla. Uh, Lulu, and by the way, I don't own Tesla. Lulu is starting to look interesting at these prices. Hoping for it to go below $180 a share. Thanks. Um, yeah, all I see is Aloe out here. I don't see anyone wearing Lulu anymore. That doesn't mean that they won't. These things are cyclical. still generating good free cash. I really liked the company a lot better when that founder ran it. That guy had personality. He was a he was a killer. Um margin still okay. Revenue is flattish but okay. Uh let's see here. Yeah, it's pretty darn conservative. Uh I mean they're going to face continued competitive pressures. Uh obviously the stock is pricing a lot of that in. Yeah, I think at 180 you got to maybe take a strong look at getting involved. Uh, free cash flow is still solid. Balance sheet's good. I mean, when you're generating that amount of cash, you have a lot of options. You can buy fast growing small brands. You can buy back stock. You can issue a dividend. Uh I think I think it's okay, Max. Uh I'd have to understand how they're dealing with competitive pressures, and that's probably going to come from listening to four or five um conference calls, but it's probably okay, and we'll probably never do anything with it. Uh, Simon Stasunus. You know, the thing about brands is they're very cyclical. And what I love about VF Corp is number one, it's priced for bankruptcy and it's not going bankrupt. Number two, it's got a complete winner during the turnaround situation. And number three is I have a lot of outs. When I got involved, they had uh Supreme also, which they used to pay down $1.5 billion of debt. That took bankruptcy off the table. They got four or five other brands. Some are going to be slower when others are going. So, like if I'm dealing with customer preferences, I love having that portfolio versus relying on one specific name. Um, but I but I do think Lulu is going to be okay. Simon Stasunus, thoughts on Taylor Wimpy, British homebuilder? 9% yield. I mean, this thing wasn't even doing well when you had lower rates. So, let's see if anything's going to change. All right. I mean, the revenues haven't grown in a decade. They're they're down from a decade ago. I I don't think so. Not enough margin of safety. If you want to buy it for the dividend, just buy something else. Uh Rob, we never buy a stock for a dividend. Rob Dillingham, uh wondering looking into energy thoughts about energy transfer. It's fine, but you're never going to make a lot of money. It's just for the dividend. We don't like midstream. No, I wouldn't buy it up here. No way. Absolutely too late. Nope. Not for me. These things were beat down for a while. I mean, it's like buying a You're better off buying a tea bill. So, no, they're better plays in energy where you have more upside. KD Modi, I know it's too early to take a look at Indian markets. Uh I I don't I don't even think I we can't buy individual Indian names. No, can't help you on that one, partner.

I've got a few\n\n### ASK_ME_ANYTHING_QA\n\n### ASK_ME_ANYTHING_QA\nabout Intel. Yeah, we covered that. But, uh, if you can build a basis around 15 here, you're probably going to be fine. Yeah. So, free cash flow and revenues of gotten hit. Margins have gotten hit. All the chemical companies have gotten hit. But I kind of like these cyclical plays right now. Um like to see it a couple bucks lower, but I I think you could probably I think at 15 is when I start to get interested. This is not going to recover right away. It's it's blown up a lot of people, but I do think you're on the right track with that. And I I don't think you get hurt here if you take a three to five year view, but if you can get it lower, it makes the confidence level go up. Uh Paul, question on Adobe. Uh I'm not doing anything on Adobe right now because I can't model how, you know, you look at Grock images. A lot of the things that Adobe did, you can do for free in a minute on uh any of the AI platforms. So, for that reason, I'm going to just pass on a purely financial and technical basis. I'd probably be like, \"Yeah, of course.\" And that'll probably prove to be true. But I can't I can't predict that. So, it goes in my too hard pile. Areas that are never going out of style. This is a hard question, but I mean obviously AI is not going to build a house. So, home building, real estate, um, chemicals. I mean, I I think I think where you're going to lose in life is if you go into an industry because you think that's the industry where you'll make the most money versus where that's the industry you have a natural aptitude, interest, and you're going to work 24 hours a day but not feel like you're working. So, find something you're interested in. Find where you can deliver value. income never exceeds the value you deliver to the marketplace and if it does for a temporary basis it will quickly revert back to the value that you are providing. Um um so I just think it's the odds of being a successful entrepreneur are much higher than the odds of being a successful investor. you're competing against the smartest people in the world and um you have to go through cycles. You have to experience it and and the the you know 1/100th of 1% that make it through the mill wind up making exceptional incredible amounts of money. But they're few and far between. So the odds are against you. Whereas if you're an entrepreneur can start a business, fail, start a business, fail, start a business, make a ton of money. And it's a natural thing uh in America. It's not an exceptional thing. and and uh uh so that's that. Uh but there's no guarantee you're going to get really good at it. And um the early tell will have to be you have to really love it and you're already doing it 24 hours. So it's not even a question should I do this or start a business. It's like this is the only thing I would ever want to do. And for 99.9% of the people, that's not the case. They can kid themselves that that's the only thing they want to do because they feel like it's the way that they'll make the most money. But the people who make the most money, it's it's such a small filter after millions of people have tried. Uh hey Daryl, regarding Intel, when do you think the turnaround will happen? It's going to take three to five years. Uh, do they have any new gamecher technology? No. They're the leader of inferior chips. Uh, potential acquisition target by one or the other big chip makers possibly. That's what Trump is pushing for. Um, but I think you just have to let it play out. Your downsides mostly protected. Your upside is 4550 bucks if they fail on the fabs and the advanced chips and unlimited 100 plus if they get the fabs and the chips correct which is um kind of you know our base case would be 4550 but our level of confidence that they ultimately do because there's no other game in town for the higher upside is like I'd say 70 75% confidence level that it's way more than a $40 $50 stock. Um, and they and they implement as far as timeline, I don't know. I don't care. They usually take about three to five years. Uh Paul Girtz, I think Axalta coding looks kind of interesting. Okay. A XTA Yeah, I just don't think the upside is high enough for this. I mean, you probably make 50% if you're right over the next two to three years. that's not going to meet my IRRa hurdle, but I generally think, let's see what the balance sheet looks like. It's a little more leverage than I like for that type of business. $500 million of cash, $3.5 billion of debt for a low grower. I think there are higher and better uses of your money until these revenues really start to reacelerate for 50% upside with that leverage. No way. It's got to be like 2x, 3x, 4x. Landon H. Thoughts of NBR trading. It'll probably work, but it's not what we're here for. neighbors. I prefer Varco, but let's just take a look here. Still negative free cash flow. $2 and half billion dollars of debt, 400 million of cash. Not ideal. Again, why I like natural oil while Elvarco much better balance sheet. Uh let's see what else here. I I think it's going to work on a trading basis. I I don't like this as much. You got to be careful with balance sheets when you get into the energy sector. keep increasing the share count. Probably works for a trade, but I don't like this one as much. BDX like the theme. Beckon Dickinson. It's the same type of theme as uh Baxter. Uh let's see. BDX Short answer, it's probably okay. Long answer, you got a lot of work to do before you commit capital. The upside's not big enough for me. There's not bags in this. There might be a double in it. Not that interesting. Drew Robinson. Fizz F. Yeah, it's it's meh. It's okay. Not for me. Uh Josh Kaplan Five serve. buy in shares, get good free cash flow. I I mean this is uh merchant solutions and all this stuff. I'm not crazy about this business. partially because of the reasons that Andrew gave on the call. The one that I want to be involved in for the next three years and out is is PayPal. I think that's the one. I think the others are going to hit margin compression over time and potentially uh PayPal will as well, but I think right now they're in the right space at the right time and it's so cheap and they have so much optionality and they have a dynamic turnaround leader that I want to participate. But this is not really one that gets me excited despite the numbers looking good on paper. KWR, you know, it's funny, there's an old saying, everyone tries to like find this perfect formula and etc. And it's like there's the old saying, the young man knows the rules, the old man knows the exceptions. And the only way you can know the exceptions, like you could look at all these companies and be like, oh, you know, cash flow is doing this, why doesn't he like it? It's, you know, he's contradicting himself. It's because I've been to all these movies a million times before and I know where the rules apply and I know where they don't. And that's that's the tremendous value ad. Uh KWR uh it's you got to have a sound framework and then you got to know the exceptions, which is uh a whole art unto itself. Um KWR Quaker. Again, I like this theme. It's kind of okay on that front. Yeah, I'm not in love with this one, but I think it's going to work for you. So, I think that's pretty decent. It's not one that I would be in, but um thanks for sending it in. U a try looking for value. Love to take a look at Japan. I I I will never buy a Japanese stock. They're done. Um, unless it's a big multinational WDB. Here we go. problem you're going to have with Japan for the foreseeable future is their central bank is going to have to be raising rates while the rest of the world is lowering rates and yen is going to appreciate massively and it's going to hurt all of they're basically an export-driven country with no significant natural resources with horrible demograph traffic. It's like the the trifecta of uh bad news. So, um you know, you get all these value guys jumping in and they've been stuck in these value traps for 10 years and then they get these bouts of rallies and they think it's going to be the time and it just never works. So, uh for that reason, I'm out. warehouses. I'd rather have GXO. You have Brad Jacobs involved. You don't have I don't know who the management is for this. And it's a hard B. Well, geez. I don't see anything wrong with it fundamentally. Um, not a big fan of French companies. Generally speaking, you can't fire people. Um, but, uh, obviously LVMH has done just fine. Cash. Oh, wow. This is, if these numbers are correct, this is excessively levered. $3 billion of debt, 10 million of cash. So, double check that. You could lose all your money if that's true. So, uh, I'd probably pass one on it being French and two on the balance sheet, but just double check those numbers because they're not always right on KOIN or any other service that's not an SEC public filing directly from the company. \n\n\n### ASK_ME_ANYTHING_QA\nunless it's a big multinational.

    "FEATURED_COMPANY_DEEP_DIVES": "\n\nAnd then let's get down to the media. So, first and foremost, I want to uh introduce you to Andrew Keys. He is the founder and uh co-founder and the chairman of the Ether Machine, the ticker DY NX. \n### FEATURED_COMPANY_DEEP_DIVES\nYou'll see all the full disclosures at the beginning of this and uh we'll go into it. And this is kind of not what we normally cover on the podcast, but I do think that understanding what's going on with this technology is extremely valuable. So, we made an exception. And what I thought would be a 10 to 15 minute segment uh turned out to be more. And it turned out to be more because the information that Andrew was sharing was so incredibly valuable in terms of a a peak into the future and comparing it to the past kind of the advent of the internet and other aspects. So I think this is going to be helpful for you just in terms of general knowledge. So uh listen in here to welcome everyone. We have an ex extremely special guest today. the co-founder and chairman of the Ether Machine, my friend Andrew Keys. And we have to do a bunch of full disclosure here, Andrew. Uh first off, uh we became friends on the golf course. I was invited to speak at a family office conference in Puerto Rico and you have a place down in in Dorado. And I I remember telling the host uh they're like, \"What do you need? We'll pay your full freight.\" I was like, \"Look, I'll go down there and do this thing on one condition.\" They're like, \"What's that?\" I was like, \"I want to play Dorado.\" And uh so it was I had to fly down on Sunday. And I remember texting the guy on Saturday like, \"Where's my tea time? I'm not getting on a plane without my tea time.\" So uh so apparently he hit a text chain. Andrew said, \"I'll take this guy out.\" And we click because uh for a number of reasons. Number one, just generally liked each other, but two, we grew up in New Jersey, fellow Jersey guys, a few towns away from each other. Three, golf addicts, although I think I probably shot a 95 the first time we played together. And that's that's my lititness test because if someone invites me back to play after I embarrass myself, I know we're going to be great friends. Um, and then uh over time, this has gone back a few couple few years now, uh, you became a client of Great Hill Capital, which I'm very grateful and it wasn't just a one-off, uh, you've regularly added added funds and, uh, we're extremely grateful for that. And uh in full disclosure, I became an investor in the private placement of the Ether machine, which I'm very excited about. And you have to know from my podcast, Hedge Fund Tips with Tom Hayes, I'm going to get a lot of blowback because they're going to say, \"Wait, don't you buy companies that make hammers and building supplies and generators and airplanes?\" And the answer is yes. This would be something kind of outside the mandate of what we do. But it's so interesting and one of the key tenants of how I invest is I bet on the jockey. So this is an area that I know absolutely nothing. I mean I know enough to get myself in trouble, but I I'm not an expert in, but I wanted to participate and I want that to be fully disclosed before we talk about this because I think this is going to be extremely helpful. It's extremely timely and people are going to want to know about it and then choose to do whatever they want with this information. But not to have it at this point in history, I think is probably uh a mistake for a lot of people. So, uh wi\n\n actively manage risk around the public debt markets efficiently. \n### FEATURED_COMPANY_DEEP_DIVES\nMicro Strategy just recently came out and said that if there is  a MNAV of the Micro Strategy stock that's greater than four they would aggressively sell equity. If it's between two and a half to four, they would opportunistically sell equity. If it's under two and a half times, they would not sell equity because that gets to a point where it starts being dilutive to shareholders rather than accreative. And we we will be similarly opportunistic. And my whole benchmark of this vehicle is Ether concentration per share. Meaning I will only a as patient zero as the largest shareholder as someone who wants to lead by example and not suggest anyone do something that I wouldn't do myself I will be maniacally focused on accreative ways to access the public equity and debt markets and it's market dependent\n\n### FEATURED_COMPANY_DEEP_DIVES\nwith that said , we would start with ether generating yield accretive acquisitions potentially. And and so what I mean is that is, you know, there are custodians that we could acquire that get paid in Ether for custodying assets uh that we could use. There are staking companies that we could acquire that get paid in Ether for staking. And then as time evolves, uh, we could consider having, uh, other types of M&A that that that wouldn't necessarily be completely ether, uh, denominated, but could, you know, add to the enterprise value as the space matures. And I think that we there's kind of a crawl, walk, run, or a short, medium, long-term, however you want to kind of phrase or cliche of of of what this vehicle can be. And and I think that that'll be up to kind of market dependent and shareholder dependent and and and we're going to, you know, work with our shareholders on kind of the meritocratic best way forward.\n### MEDIA_APPEARANCE_RECAP\nAnd we're back. Uh and then I had the pleasure to join David Lynn. And I love joining David Lynn's show because his audience is so engaged. Uh every single time I've been on the last two, three years, I've been bullish. It tends to be a hard money. gold world is ending uh uh slant of an audience. Uh so they don't love when a bull comes on and and uh I get a kick out of the comments in the show notes when they criticize the hell out of me. And then David is so kind each time to say Tom's been right. Tom's been right. Tom's been right. And um uh we'll hope to keep that streak going. The early part of this is the normal Fed stuff which David likes to talk about which is kind of you know b boring at this point but useful in terms of understanding uh the calculations but the second half turned into something that I did not expect that it was which is where we aggressively dug into the framework and some aspects of my investing framework that maybe I haven't explained in such a clear way in the past. So, I think you're going to find this one valuable. Here we go. If he's right, he still has a leg a high level of disscent that you haven't seen since the early '9s. Two people dissenting him holding rates high. And if he's wrong, he's totally screwed because everyone knew he's too late Powell. The question is, will he or will he stay belligerent Powell and trying to uh kind of get back at the president? Well, you were right last year in calling for a cut before uh inflation reaches 2%. So, we're nowhere close to 2% still. In fact, it's gone up. What's then your outlook for the rest of the year? How many cuts are we getting? Thomas Hayes, managing member of Great Hill Capital, returns once more to the show. We'll be talking about his outlook for stock markets and uh his reaction to the latest uh news regarding um the uh jobs provisions on Friday as well as a new tariffs imposed last week. Welcome back to the show, Thomas. Good to see you. >> Thanks for having me, David. Great to be here. Initially, I wasn't really sure what the markets were reacting to last Friday afternoon. Was it the jobs revisions? Was it tariffs? Was it both? What do you think? I think that uh certainly the jobs look largest overall revision in 50 years. I mean, that's not just a, you know, a government rounding error that that's not even in the same ballpark. So, uh, what that did was it took us from a hawkish setup following the Fed meeting last week when everyone was like you couldn't believe how belligerent Powell was being uh uh regarding rate cuts. when you consider the the level of uh how restrictive he is right now and then you get this jobs report on Friday when it acknowledges oh my goodness the labor market is a lot weaker than anticipated so their dual mandate is back on the table uh which is very constructive and we're seeing already the odds of a September cut have moved up over 90% so that is going to change a lot of things and you started to see it even reflect ed uh yesterday uh with all the indices down except for one. What what was the one? Small caps were up meaningfully yesterday uh which will be a huge beneficiary of rate cuts cuz they've got uh slightly more leverage and and operating leverage in them. And the cuts uh imply we could see a reaceleration now that they they\n\n### FEATURED_COMPANY_DEEP_DIVES\nmanufacturing resurgence in the US is a durable theme. And some of these technologies, whether it's AI, robotics, whether it's uh uh are going to help accelerate that because what what largely makes the US uncompetitive is regulations and labor costs. So Trump is going to gut the regulations and some of these technologies uh brought to you by robotics brought to you by AI. I mean we're seeing it in one holding we have GXO Logistics which uh which Brad Jacobs uh was one of Brad Jacobs spin-offs one of the greatest wealth creators for stockholders in history whether it was Waste Connections, United Rentals, XPO, now he's got QXO and he has GXO. uh they're one of the biggest utilizers of these humanoid type of robots in their warehouses. Not not the Tesla ones, but other companies make great robots. Uh and they will continue to benefit and that's a huge scaled business with one of the largest logistics providers in the world and uh warehousing and\n\nthe weighing machine wins in the long term. So I can't tell you whether Palunteer goes to 400 time sales or 200 time sales or 100 time sales. I mean there's obviously they're doing things that are special and the question is and they're a great company and they have strong leadership and all that stuff. Um the question is how much of the future lifech changing impact of their product is already priced into the stock today. And this company could do everything that he's talking about for or 10xing the revenues. Uh you know, look, if he 10xes revenues, it's still trading at 10 times sales. So, you know, if it's trading at 100 times now. So, the question is what's the right price? And and uh no one asks that question until there's a little bit of an air pocket in the economy or in the market or in performance or you know candidly the ones that are chasing it because it's up so much are going to be the same ones panicking out when it's down 5%. And then there'll be a different batch that are panicking when it's down 10%. And there'll be a different batch that absolutely puke it out when it's down 20%. And then there are ones that will puke it in the hole down 60%. ### MISCELLANEOUS\nuh when guys like me start to look at it seriously and and take a look at it for the long term and see if there's too much blood in the streets relative to the incredible things that they're doing. So, it's just a different framework and and I would say too, Mike, I think people have this scarce mindset that it has to be either or either you're a growth manager and that's good or you're a value manager and that's bad or or vice versa. And I don't view it that way. I I think you're you're going to have a guest on named Dan Ives. I think he's brilliant and I think he operates in a different framework and a different model that works exceptionally well for him and I like him very much and I listen to what he said what he says and and uh uh and and respect what he says and learn from what he says but I I just operate in a different framework and I'm perfectly comfortable with errors of omission. Okay, this is what I learned from Charlie Mer. Like when God was handing out FOMO jeans, he didn't hand one out to Tom Hayes. So I'm genetically different. I I don't I don't lose a wink of sleep over a stock that's runaway and going crazy that I'm that I'm not participating in. A lot of people do because they see their neighbor, they upgraded from a Toyota to a Hyundai or what whatever the hell happened. like it it doesn't matter because I know in the long term the weighing machine like we do exceptionally well and do following our framework and staying in our lane and sticking with our knitting. ### FEATURED_COMPANY_DEEP_DIVES\nUm and I think that people have to get comfortable maybe you're genetically wired to be a growth investor and just do it better than anyone else. You got uh William O'Neal kind of set the framework. Subscribe to Investors Business Daily. Buy the book How to Make Money in Stocks and you can be a growth investor. Uh if you want to, you know, if if you think more business-like about how to why you buy a piece of a business is for uh a piece of the future cash flow, then you know, you're probably genetically wired to be a better value investor than a growth investor. And it doesn't mean you're different. It just means like, you know, one kid, one of my daughters loves chocolate, one loves vanilla. And it's never going to change. That's just how they're wired. So, accept it. And uh and one's not better than the other. It's just a different framework. And if you want to win at one framework, listen to people who are really good at one framework. Don't listen to me about how to buy the next Palunteer. Listen to me about how to buy Generrack when it's down 70% even though it's got 75% of the home standby generator market and it doubles over a few, you know, couple years. >> Got it. And I I want to leave plenty of time for you to talk about today's picks, but if anybody's listening to this, I do want to point out, I mean, Tom highlighted some of the names that he's been in even longer than he's talked about them at at money show events. But on my screen here, just year to date, for example, Generrack up about 27%, Boeing up about 26%, Advanced Auto Parts was another name up 15%. Uh, and again, these are names that he's been in for a lot longer. So, understand the profit potential is there if you get the timing and the price right. uh even not just relative to the market but relative to some of these great growth names that get the\n\n### FEATURED_COMPANY_DEEP_DIVES\nmost people don't think they will. Even at 16.5 to 17 million, this business is not going to earn $7 a share because they've become so much more efficient. We think it can earn $10 a share. So if it traded at $146 at $7.19 of earnings, call it 20 times earnings. Um at $10 earnings, the question is what multiple does the market apply when we hit the next cycle peak? Does it apply 10 times? Then you got a $100 stock in which case it would be 20 20 bagger off of our initial basis. Uh 10 bagger off of some of the the later people that came in. Uh if you get a 20 times multiple again, a peak multiple, you could have a $200 stock. Is that our base case? No. But would it surprise us if we wind out wind up with a blended 20x 15 20x 25x on it? No. And this is something that's very easy. We don't have to predict is someone willing to pay 150 time sales versus 125 times sales and just gamble there will be people coming in buying us. I mean, it's a very simple formula. At 10 times earnings, it's not going to be hard to attract a lot of buyers. At 15 times earnings, if they're generating 10 bucks, it it's not unrealistic to think it could trade to 150 to 200. And if you and if you're skeptical, cut it in half. You still have a triple from these levels. Uh, which, you know, over a three four year period is a pretty attractive scenario. So nothing is perfectly without risk, but we try to minimize risk and cover. You know, I was taught number one, never let them take you out on a stretcher. That was my first boss. Okay. So, uh, and and number two, if you protect the downside, the upside take takes care of itself. And that's what we try to do every day is sleep every night, underwrite it as if you're buying the whole company. And if you're not willing to buy the whole company with 100% of your net worth as the equity, don't buy one share. You don't have to be involved in everything. You can actually read\n\nor if that's what you like to do, participate and then watch it very closely because when it turns, it turns quickly. And if you don't like golf and you like to spend 24/7 in front of the screens, then you can probably make some money that way. But, uh, you know, I like to have a balanced life and I like to buy good businesses. You know, if you own 10 10 franchises, you're not sitting at a screen uh watching the cash register things tick up and down and saying, \"Oh my gosh, you know, receipts are down uh 8% in the last 60 minutes. I better sell that franchise.\" Like, you know, it's uh that's just not the way it works. And candidly, that's why, you know, a lot of my clients have made, you know, fortunes, hundreds of millions of dollars in real estate. Um, I think part of the reason a lot of people become wealthy in real estate is because they don't have daily liquidity. I think if they did have daily liquidity, they'd be in a lot of trouble. That and they have a lot of leverage in real estate. Uh, and they pay no taxes. So, those three things are helpful. But, uh, there have been plenty of people that, uh, you know, there's the old saying, if you want to become a multi-millionaire, get into real estate. Uh, buy buy real estate. If you want to become a billionaire, buy businesses. And you've seen that from the icons and the Buffets. uh uh and the Coopermanmans of the world and some of the private equity guys etc. So we we just try to underwrite it as if if we were buying the whole business and if you operate from that framework I think you're going to be very happy. I think in the short term it's it's kind of the tortoise in the hair. Uh in the short term the hair is going to look really good and be winning the race and then all of a sudden it falls flat on its face because it runs out of gas and the air pockets come and the the turtle just walks right by because he just plots along doing his thing that doesn't get distracted. doesn't look this way, it doesn't look that way. Uh, and sure enough, they wind up with the with the gold medal. >> I definitely want to leave time for your next pick. It's kind of an interesting name when I saw you come through in the in the energy space. But before I do, just briefly on Cooper tariff issues, anything that that's going to mean for for this company's business, uh, the way you look at it? uh they've they've addressed that in the recent uh conference calls and and and that's another important thing is like if you own a piece of a business and you're not listening to the people you've hired to run that business for you, which is the the managers, you're you're really missing out. I mean, you know, we go through every earnings call transcript with literally a fine tooth comb. Our weekly articles we cover, we underline literally word for word the most important things they said. and you miss that nuance. And some people try to get cute with AI and they say summarize the call and you really miss how they were saying it. And sometimes listening is better even than reading because you can get a sense of the nuance and really it's like if I'm having a conversation with you and and you say, \"I'm really excited about Palunteer.\" Or you say, \"I'm really excited about Palanteer.\" You know, it's going to show up the same in the transcript, but you could say, \"I don't know. he seems like he's he's not excited, you know, or he's like he's he's like super excited. I better look into this. Uh so so so missing that nuance is kind of it's it's a little old school, but there's a lot of value to it because you got human beings running your business. When one day we'll have humanoid robots and maybe it'll be different, but for now, uh missing that nuance can be very very you can leave a lot of money on the table, uh doing that. So uh we we try to try to focus on that. >> What what was the question? >> Oh, sure. just briefly, you know, tariff impact on on the >> Oh, yeah. So, so they've been they've been they've been able to dramatically min minimize that. Uh, a lot of it they're not shipping crossber. They're shipping to factories within where they produce within the countries that they produce. So, it becomes the OEM issue. It becomes the Ford and the GM's issue more than the Cooper standard. It's not without impact, but they've really meaningfully minimized it and it's it's priced in at this level and it's not going to ultimately have meaningful impact on the volumes because at the end of the day, you still have the average car on the road 13.5 years, they they break down, they get scrapped after a while. So, uh I think the big thing, the number one driver of volumes, forget about looking at Cooper Standard, forget about looking, all I'm looking at is incentives. And if you look at the industry incentives on cars, meaning just go watch a football game, are you seeing more ads that say 0% financing or 2.9% financing? Are you seeing less ads? The answer is you're seeing a lot more ads. And that's not great for the OEMs because their margins are going to contract. It's going to be a race to the bottom. They they thought they could get away with this controlled scarcity that they got away with during COVID where they could sell the Escalades at 20,000 above MSRP. that game is over. The Koreans are coming in. If if the US producers aren't going to provide volumes, the Koreans and the Japanese are and therefore uh it's a race to bond. We're going to see huge amounts of volumes, which benefits the Cooper Standard and other auto suppliers. Uh it may not it'll help their volume numbers, the OEMs, but their margins are going to contract because the incentives are going to go up. The more the incentives go up due to competition, the bigger the volumes and we get paid per car. uh and that that's where we really benefit. So if you look through these cycles, the number one indicator of where volumes are headed are are incentives uh and the incentives have been going up in a straight line for the basically the past 12 13 months. So it's early days. It usually goes for 36 to 48 months and that's where you get that huge operating leverage kick in and uh huge profits to the bottom line. >> Got it. Got it. Well, let's move on. Energy services, oil feed, oil field services, if I can get that out there. Uh that's one of your names. talk a little bit about this other idea you brought to the table. >> Yeah, so we're trying to figure out a way we had a we still have a company called Comtock Resources which is natural gas. We want to have energy exposure partially because it's out of favor uh partially because of the energy policies of this administration. Now if you look to uh Trump 1.0 energy stocks actually did poorly because you know increased production reduces profitability. So how could we benefit from these this change in policy uh without being as sensitive to the price of the commodity and what we came out up with was oil field services uh national oil wellvarco as they used to be called now they're called nov inc uh is a leader in OEM in onshore and offshore drilling rigs they not only produce them they service them they have the largest install base the largest share Uh so I think what you're going to see we we're probably at or near the trough in terms of rig count. As that starts to tick up their operating leverage is huge. And usually with these energy companies um they have levered balance sheets. And in the case of National Oil Well Varco, they got $1.2 billion of cash. They got $1.7 billion of debt. They're generating a billion dollars of free cash flow per year in in kind of the worst part of the cycle. So, we don't have to worry about whether they're going to be here. And we, as a leader in what they do, again, the operating leverage is enormous. So, even if the rigs tick up just a hair, the money that's going to go straight to the bottom line with 50% install base, uh, is going to be staggering and it's going to make a billion dollars of free cash flow look like nothing. They'll be generating two and three and four billion. And you're going to have a stock that goes from, you know, 12 bucks to 40 50 bucks uh over the next few years. in our opinion, not advice. Uh, and these are the type of things that we look for. Our downsides protected because their balance sheet income statement is is is solid. They're they're generating a ton of free cash flow to service the small amount of relative debt that they have. And they're doing it in the worst operating environment. So, two things that happen. Number one, drilling happens more when the price of oil goes up. And number two, which people aren't thinking about, drilling happens more when the cost of leverage goes down. Most of these EMP companies are have levered balance sheets. So if they can refinance at lower rates, which we expect will be the case uh in the next handful of months, uh that changes the economics to the prices that where it becomes profitable to drill based on their cost of capital. and they're going to want to take advantage of the policies in place uh to get more rigs in production uh ahead of the risk of a different type of regime coming into play. Get it in now, get it going uh even if it's at break even or slightly unprofitable and NOV will be there to provide them uh all the services that they need in order to make that happen both onshore and offshore. So we we love that. We you know we looked a lot if you look at the underweight positioning of managers etc. We we're trying to find ways to express that in energy and candidly I don't think enough of the ENTP companies have come down in price enough relative to uh the price of crude how how much that's come down. Uh so I I kept looking at the underweight and seeing that there just wasn't any opportunity that I was there wasn't enough margin of safety in the exploration and production names in the serer names I see huge opportunity. So even if the price drops more uh with a company like NOV Inc. Uh the margin of safety is such that I don't have to worry about it and if it goes against me before it doubles and triples we'll buy more. >> Got it. But listeners, if you're watching this, uh, you have any\n\nthat excess 600 or $900 billion of unnecessary interest rate payments and the additional income. uh that it's basically like giving out stimulus checks for everyone who has fixed income securities or a checking account that's earning interest. Uh so it's something to be uh very mindful of. \n### MACRO_DATA_SLIDES\nHealthcare S&P 500 weight uh guys this is again these are generational opportunities when you have health care uh at the percentage weight of the S&P 500. I remember we did charts like this during COVID when energy was like 1 or 2% of the S&P waiting down from 9% and we were buying uh Exxon Mobile till the cows come home in the low30s when oil was trading negative and the waiting was 2% and people were getting fired in pensions if they owned energy stocks and everyone said it was all over and then boom it just completely doubled and tripled. Um, healthc care is at that right now. Uh, certainly biotech exposure is going to be good. \n### FEATURED_COMPANY_DEEP_DIVES\nBaxter, it looks like it's bottomed here, which is exciting because we were able to buy an unbelievable amount. Uh, and we covered it in this week's article. Um, uh, in the low 20s. So, that's exciting. And bring our basis down. \n### TECHNICAL_CHARTS\nUh, year three of bull markets can be choppy. This is from Carson, but you can see we are early in a secular bull. I discussed that with David. This is a great chart. Uh rolling 10-year relative performance of small cap stocks versus large cap stocks. This is when you want to be a ba massive buyer. You had the biggest outperformance in the shortest period of time from 2001 to 2007, from 1954 to basically 1983, uh from 1936 to 1947. So, um, you know, I I actually had someone text me and said, you can't make this stuff up. I mean, um, they said, I think you're wrong on small caps because over the last, hold on, I'll read it. I mean, I over the last 11 weeks or 12 weeks, the S&P is up 12% off the lows and small caps are only up 11%. I I I can't help people like that. Um, but um they exist, so it is what it is. Uh what we try to do here is  we try to skate to where the puck is going. And um when it turns, it turns all at once. So what is a 1 or 2% underperformance the last however many weeks will be 30 to 40% outperformance over the next 20 40 months. And uh and then they'll say what happened and they'll be the ones that got phase planted because they were chasing stocks at 100 times sales that fell 75% because they missed one quarter by 3%. So, um, but if if if people like that didn't exist, we would be out of a job because emotional people are what creates the opportunities for us to buy incredibly beautiful, boring, durable businesses at exceptional prices and then just wait for them to revert to the mean over time uh and and outperform in that regard. So, um, moving on,\n\n### FEATURED_COMPANY_DEEP_DIVES\nBaxter, our sleepy medical device pick, reported what we would call a textbook definition of a kitchen sink quarter last week. take all the medicine at once and set the stage for new CEO Andrew Haidider to walk in like a hero, suddenly having the mightest touch for a business that has gone nowhere but down for years. There were two shots of medicine in the Q2 report that spooked the market and led to a fullear guidance cut. First, management voluntarily paused shipments and installations of its Noam IQ infusion platform to work with customers and address feedback. Noam was Baxter's shiny new product with strong backlog already taking nearly two points of market share annually and a key driver behind the 6% growth in the MPT segment last quarter. Second, hospital IV fluid conservation efforts have lingered longer than expected following hurricane Helen and the North Cove recovery, delaying a return to historical norms. Combined, these overhangs led management to lower full f fullyear sales guidance from four to 5% growth to 3 to 4% growth and trim EPS guidance from a range of 247 to 255 down to 245 to 252. So basically, you know, 252 down to 247, the stock sells off 30%. That for me is opportunity of the a lifetime. Okay, so we've been stuffing as much as we could. Same with VFC Corp. Same with Intel. No change in any of those. And National Oil Well Varco. By the way, uh in markets, Mr. Market's eyes, that was enough to knock the stock down over 20%. You can't make this up. We had a much different reaction in the news. In fact, we will be mailing Christmas cards for the next couple of years to those who handed over their shares of Baxter uh hovers at 19 years lows. Not only are both headwinds temporary, but this guidance is what we call the morticians forecast for the back half of the year. Aka, this was sandbagging at its finest. Take the fluid conservation story. Management has already seen improvement and expects more into the back half and into 2026. Yet, their outlook assumes zero recovery this year. And even if hospitals remain cautious, these IV fluid customers have minimum volume commitments. Either they buy more or they pay more. Then there's a NOM IQ pause. The low end of the guidance now assumes it stays off the market through year end. This is despite management aiming to resume shipments as soon as possible and the decision to pause being completely voluntary. There was no FDA mandate and no requirement for a permanent fix. Even so, they chose to model zero contribution from their most important new product through year end. Here's how we see it potentially playing out. Andrew Haidider steps in this September. By his first or second earnings call, Q4, Q1, Baxter will suddenly report that Novam IQ is shipping again and flying off the shelves. Meanwhile, fluid conservation trends have magically improved. Haidider will be hailed as a miracle worker, and the turnaround will suddenly feel obvious overnight, tomorrow's newspaper today. But really, this is all just short-term noise. The big picture turnaround remains well on track. Priority number one was cleaning up the balance sheet and that box is checked. Selling the kidney care business for 3.8 billion not only brought leverage down to a projected three times by year end, it also got rid of the slowest growth and lowest margin segment of the portfolio, which means the multiple caner rate. Now it's all about execution. And the good news is this isn't the type of business that needs to reinvent the wheel. This is IV bags, pumps, hospital beds, etc. are boring, stable, and predictable. And that's Andrew Haidider's bread and butter. During his time as CEO of ATS, a company that designs and manufactures automated systems and equipment, the stock hit a peak of 5x from when he joined after just 6 years at the helm. Before that, he learned from the best at Danaher. In the case of Baxter, we think a couple clean quarters of solid execution and proof that they can get back to the four to 5% growth rate will go a long way. Management still sees a clear path back to high teens operating margins and has already made solid progress improve improving the trough of 14.3% in 2023 to 15 to 16% this year. Once it becomes obvious obvious we expect the market to reward that progress with a meaningful rerating. Baxter currently trades at just nine times earnings, the lowest we have seen since 2003 when the company was dealing with patient deaths linked to contaminated dialysis machines. That's not funny, but it's funny that the multiple is that low considering we're dealing with nothing like that at the moment. A move back towards sector average and Baxter's own historical 16 to 17 times multiple feels inevitable once the dust settles. Until then, we sit on our hands, collect the dividend, and simply let the story play out. Sooner or later, boring will be beautiful and Baxter wins that prize all day long. So, we underlined and highlighted all the most important aspects of the results and all the most important aspects of the earnings call as well as highlighting the top 10 takeaways which you can go to hedge funfundtips.com and read on your own. Now, on to Stanley Black & Decker rebounding off the lows liberation day lows. Um and you can see here margins starting to reacelerate, cash flows remaining positive and strong uh despite the tariff headwind in the short term and the business re accelerating in terms of cash flow per share uh reacelerating in terms of um earnings per share etc. So despite headline numbers that crushed expectations reporting adjusted earnings of 1.08 08 per share versus 42 cents. Consensus and revenue of 3.95 billion in line with estimates. Stanley Black & Decker's solid second quarter and continued progress in the turnaround were overshadowed by the market's tariff tantrum tariff tantrum turning what was fundamentally a strong print into what looked like a weak quarter. Management guided to a potential $800 million annualized impact from tariffs in 2025, which hit the single most important metric in the turnaround story, which is gross margins. margins fell to 27.5% in Q2, down 170 basis points year-on-year, with 3% of that tied directly to tariff pressure. Those two numbers were all the market needed to write off this quarter as an ugly one. But when you actually do the work under the surface, it is nowhere near as bad as Mr. Market's knee-jerk reaction would suggest. That $800 million doomsday figure excludes any mitigation actions. Excludes any mitigation actions which are already well underway. management implemented an initial price increase back in April with demand remaining consistent post increase and another modest increase is planned for early Q4. They're also working to improve USMCA compliance where possible and plan to reduce their China manufacturing footprint to under 5% by the end of 2026. These steps are expected to reduce the actual tariff impact to just 60 to 65% of the 800 million. For those of you not good with math, that's about $300 million less. Most importantly, management expects pricing and mitigation to largely offset the entire tariff headwind by 2026. Again, most importantly, management expects pricing and mitigation to largely offset the entire tariff headwind by 2026, not 2029, 2026. That sets up Q2 gross margins as an inflection point for the year. Both Q3 and Q4 are expected to show 152 north of 200 basis points of year-over-year margin expansion with Q4 margins landing in the 34 33 to 34% range. That puts Stanley Black & Decker just a hair shy of its long-term target above 35%. A level management expects to reach in the second half of 2026. Not 2036. 2026. Keep in mind, the last time this business had gross margins above 35%, it generated $85 in EPS and traded north of $150 a share. It's in the 60s right now, ladies and gentlemen. And by the way, none of this recovery depends on volume. This is pure cost-driven margin improvement. No market rebound, no operating leverage, just execution. But when the market does turn, and it's inevitable, Stanley Black & Decker will be a cash machine. Tariffs don't change the multi-million dollar using unit housing shortage caused by a decade plus of underbuilding. They don't change demographics with over 70 million millennials entering prime family formation for years. And they don't change this administration's laser focus on cutting red tape and improving housing. Ladies and gentlemen, when rates come down and housing wakes up from the dead, it will suddenly become the new shiny object of the object trade of the market. And this beach ball that has been held underwater will explode higher. We skate to where the puck is going, not to where it's already been. It is only a matter of time.\n\n### FEATURED_COMPANY_DEEP_DIVES\nVF Corp. Some of the key highlights. Uh we're probably going to go into more detail on this in the very near future, but here were the 10 key takeaway points. Number one, Q1 revenues of 1.8 billion down 2% year-over-year beat consensus by 59.85 million and came in ahead of prior guidance for a decline of 3 to 5% adjusted loss per share of.24 was10 uh 10 cents better than analyst expectation and compares to a loss of 35 cents in the same period last year. Two adjusted gross margins for the quarter came in at 54.1% up 200 basis points year-over-year and well ahead of the 52.1% consensus estimates driven by higher quality inventory lower discounts and favorable FX. This resulted in an adjusted operating loss of just 56 million, a significant improvement over prior guidance calling for a loss between 125 million and 110 million. Q2 gross margins are expected to remain broadly flat with adjusted operating income projected in the range of 260 million to 290 million. Fully year operating income is still expected to grow compared to last year's 556 million. Most importantly, the fiscal 2028 targets of 55% gross margins and 10% operating margins remain well on track. Number three, as we like to say, the number one thing we want to see in any turnaround is free cash flow recovering. Management still expects free cash flow to be up versus last year's 313 million even after accounting for tariff impacts and excluding the sale of non-core assets. Number four, net debt was down $1.4 billion or 20% compared to last year as management remains on track to achieve the medium-term leverage target of 2.5 times by fiscal year 2028. VFC ended last year at 4.1 times and expects to be below that by the end of this fiscal year with the $500 million bond expected to be paid down at the end of at year end using free cash flow and other short-term borrowing if needed. Five. Northace continues to deliver solid growth up 5% this quarter with strong improvement in overall profitability. Footwear was the standout growing strong double digits with bags and packs also seeing double digit growth. The brand remains on its path to doubling revenue over time as management works to turn it into a four season style brand very similar to what Canada Goose is doing. Next six. Vans revenues for the quarter were down 15% with roughly 40% of the decline driven by deliberate and channel rationaliz deliberate channel rationalization. Excluding that, fans would have been down high single digits. Management continues to see green shoots across the business with America's all sellout trends with America's sellout trends improving as nonvalue accounts grew again this quarter. Appointment bookings at Paris Fashion Week in June were up 50% as the brand leans further into premium product. New styles like the super lowro and current cappell skate which by the way I have the brown current skate and I have the I think I have the low pro. Uh those were the new ones I bought. I got to check on that. I think they're skate low or low pro or something. And also driving strong sales from new products. management optimistic about leaning into back- to-school marketing. An inflection point at Vans may be closer than many expect. I'm seeing more and more around here. I'm I I'm in Orange County, California, so everyone wears Vans. So, uh but um anyway, seven, a key part of the van's turnaround is returning the brand to its root. And it doesn't get much clearer than bringing back the van's warped tour management. By the way, the lady at Laguna Beach Van store when I bought uh the new pair, I asked her like, \"What's, you know, how are volumes?\" And I kind of like tried to lead her to talk negative and said, you know, things been a little slow with Vans, you know, blah blah blah. And she's like, she said, \"No, actually, the the sneakers are selling like crazy.\" So, they have like this pair that I guess is like a sneaker of some sort, like a running sneaker. And I think there's a boot that they have for surfing. Uh, and the puffy things on the side. She's like, \"No, they're selling like crazy.\" So, there you go. Um, again, anecdote. We're we're looking at the data here, but, uh, that's key. So, they did the Vans warp poor warped tour. management planned three locations and expected to sell 50,000 tickets each, which would have been two times any previous single event. They sold out tickets in a matter of hours and over 2 days in Long Beach drew more than 170,000 attendees, making the event a huge boost and catalyst for the brand. Timberland continues to perform well with revenues up 9% during the quarter and higher overall margins driven by lower discounting. The brand saw growth across all channels with America's up 16% year-over-year as management remains more confident than ever about the upside opportunity to break out of Timberland's historic revenue range. 9. Other brands grew 2% during the quarter, led by Altra, which grew 20% year-over-year as it maintained its position as the number one trail running shoe in the US and continued gaining share in road running. When VFC acquired Altra in 2018, the brand was generating 60 million in revenue. This year, it's on track to exceed 250 million as management continues to scale the business. and 10 management expects total annualized tariff impact to be 250 to 270 million with 50% of that flowing through in fiscal year 2026 based on the timing of the expected increases. They anticipate a negative net impact to gross profit this year of 60 to 70 million. Most importantly, management remains confident they can fully mitigate all currently anticipated tariffs in fiscal 2027 with both medium-term margin targets still on track. Again, we underlined all the key points of the earnings call and market sentiment, fear and greed is actually back in the middle of the range at 56. National Association of Active Investment Managers is off the boil. They chased the top. Now they're getting nervous, which means in theory the pain trade could be up. We will see what happens with that possible Fed appointment and or other catalysts. S&P earnings estimates, top 30 weights up 2.12 in the last uh 60 days. 2026 estimates have come up 2.08% in the last 60 days. Russell even bigger upside revisions. top 30 weights in the last 60 days. Up 4% for this year, up just about 3% for next year. Unusual buying in UPS. This is one we've got our eyes on. Very interesting there. Uh looks like they bought the CEO bought uh and director bought one and a half million of shares. They wrote a check. That's good to see any major economic data here. Continuing jobless claims rose. This is why Powell needs to wake up. Initial jobless claims came in worse than expected. Um, etc. Okay, you can see here estimates, the most important thing on earnings are\n",
    "### MISCELLANEOUS": "\n\nAnd uh in full disclosure, I became an investor in the private placement of the Ether machine, which I'm very excited about. And you have to know from my podcast, Hedge Fund Tips with Tom Hayes, I'm going to get a lot of blowback because they're going to say, \"Wait, don't you buy companies that make hammers and building supplies and generators and airplanes?\" And the answer is yes. This would be something kind of outside the mandate of what we do. But it's so interesting and one of the key tenants of how I invest is I bet on the jockey. So this is an area that I know absolutely nothing. I mean I know enough to get myself in trouble, but I I'm not an expert in, but I wanted to participate and I want that to be fully disclosed before we talk about this because I think this is going to be extremely helpful. It's extremely timely and people are going to want to know about it and then choose to do whatever they want with this information. But not to have it at this point in history, I think is probably uh a mistake for a lot of people. So, uh wi\n\nwhat I try to do is I look at businesses that the prices come down a lot and they have a long history of performance both revenue, free cash flow, earnings and they tend to have normal cycles every 10 to 10 to 8 to 10 years where the the price pulls back quite a bit and the price pulls back a lot more than the free cash flow temporary impairment, a lot more than the revenue temporary impairment and sometimes t\n\nopportunity to break out of Timberland's historic revenue range. Other brands grew 2% during the quarter, led by Altra, which grew 20% year-over-year as it maintained its position as the number one trail running shoe in the US and continued gaining share in road running. When VFC acquired Altra in 2018, the brand was generating 60 million in revenue. This year, it's on track to exceed 250 million as management continues to scale the business. and management expects total annualized tariff impact to be 250 to 270 million with 50% of that flowing through in fiscal year 2026 based on the timing of the expected increases. They anticipate a negative net impact to gross profit this year of 60 to 70 million. Most importantly, management remains confident they can fully mitigate all currently anticipated tariffs in fiscal 2027 with both medium-term margin targets still on track. Again, we underlined all the key points of the earnings call and market sentiment, fear and greed is actually back in the middle of the range at 56. National Association of Active Investment Managers is off the boil. They chased the top. Now they're getting nervous, which means in theory the pain trade could be up. We will see what happens with that possible Fed appointment and or other catalysts. S&P earnings estimates, top 30 weights up 2.12 in the last uh 60 days. 2026 estimates have come up 2.08% in the last 60 days. Russell even bigger upside revisions. top 30 weights in the last 60 days. Up 4% for this year, up just about 3% for next year. Unusual buying in UPS. This is one we've got our eyes on. Very interesting there. Uh looks like they bought the CEO bought uh and director bought one and a half million of shares. They wrote a check. That's good to see any major economic data here. Continuing jobless claims rose. This is why Powell needs to wake up. Initial jobless claims came in worse than expected. um, etc. Okay, you can see here estimates, the most important thing on earnings are finally  starting to go up as we anticipated. Uh, now up to 301.60. I think it got down to $2.99. You can see them turning abruptly up. We had talked about the first half of the year being the revised down. Second half revised back up. And here we go. All right. Now, on to the",
    "MISCELLANEOUS": "\n\navailable uh and and it's and it's by a financial accounting standards uh bard the FASB uh deems highquality liquid assets. So, things like dollars, stocks, bonds. So, these are examples of HQLA highquality liquid assets and there are about $250 billion of highquality liquid assets which is still very small. Yeah, >> but this kind of shows you where we are in terms of kind of the adoption life cycle. And there's $250 billion of highquality liquid assets on blockchains. And 90% of those highquality liquid assets are settled on Ethereum. And and and basically these are kind of powerless dynamics uh that I would akin to Google uh where 90% plus of searches happen on Google and then ask Jeieves gets you know onetenth 1% Bing gets onetenth of 1%. Well, I Tom, when was the last time you used Yahoo? >> Yeah. >> Uh and and so and so what we're seeing and and there are technical reasons why Ethereum has this uh this kind of hegemonic position. uh Ethereum has been able to create standards uh where where basically anybody whether they're a developer in Mumbai or Paris or San Francisco can create a token based upon a token standard and that token can go into a wallet. So so basically there's the ability for any engineer to kind of standardize these assets and that's created a a large adoption. There's also kind of robustness of the technology. So, so basically there's multiple implementations of Ethereum. So, there's nine different ones that that have to form consensus and agree. So, basically it it can't go down. And then there's decentralization of of the Ethereum network, which is the most decentralized uh protocol on earth uh for for this type of throughput. Um so so basically there are a few different reasons why it's kind of become hegemonic. >> So it's almost like a network effect because 90% of these assets are on it everyone else has to be on it and it just creates this cyclical uh effect. The other thing you mentioned about decentralization I guess was one of the questions  I was going to ask. You know again not a computer scientist so this can't be hacked because of the level of decentralization and that you'd have to hack like a gazillion computers at the same time or something >> right. So, so to your point, liquidity begets liquidity, you know, to your to your prior point. And secondarily to uh this is the only way that kind of nation states can can trustlessly interact, you know, at that like size and scale because t\n\n### MISCELLANEOUS\nquestions  I was going to ask. You know again not a computer scientist so this can't be hacked because of the level of decentralization and that you'd have to hack like a gazillion computers at the same time or something >> right. So, so to your point, liquidity begets liquidity, you know, to your to your prior point. And secondarily to uh this is the only way that kind of nation states can can trustlessly interact, you know, at that like size and scale because t\n\nwhat I think is that Bitcoin was this great opening act of of kind of teaching us that I could send you value like on a global abacus and I can send you the bead but basically we can only send the bead back and forth to each other whereas with Ethereum we can create any asset on it and then create any type of uh digital legal agreement. I mean my general instinct was always with Bitcoin and and it's basically been wrong uh was that with Bitcoin you're just waiting for someone to bid it up further. Uh and it's and it's worked. Uh but but my view was like yeah it's scarce but there could be other just send type of instruments created. Whereas with Ethereum now you have this kind of flywheel and literally practical daily uh actions and contracts and and tokenizations are happening on it. Therefore there's real intrinsic value and speaking to my next kind of question is how are banks responding to the advent of Ethereum and how does that play moving forward? So, so I think it's notable to to recognize uh not a bank, but I would call it like early fast movers or competitors to bank. So, so I would I would raise Coinbase, Robin Hood, Kraken that's going to IPO in in Q1 of 2026. Um these are I would say kind of like hybrid exchanges uh kind of like fintexs that that also have crypto or crypto that have fintech uh aspirations. And basically each one of those um has created what's called a layer 2 scaling solution that settles to Ethereum. So Coinbase has created BAS. Robin Hood just created tokenized shares and they didn't name it, but basically it's a layer 2 scaling solution that settles to Ethereum. Kraken has created Inc. which is another layer 2 scaling solution that settles to Ethereum. And so what what we've seen is that kind of the fast movers that don't have kind of like the incumbent debt of being a systemically important bank over the last 20 50 100 years uh like the bold brackets are able to kind of move very quickly and with the Genius Act passage uh literally only two weeks ago we are in like a very interesting Cambrian explosion moment. I foresee that each one of these banks will likely a create their own stable coin. B create their own wallet. Uh JP Morgan just announced that they're going to basically work with, you know, their client Coinbase so that when you log into your Chase account, you can basically access uh your crypto assets that are sitting on Coinbase. uh and and and and so you're going to have this wallet, these stable coins, and and you're going to have kind of a seamless user experience where kind of the pipes blur. Tell me, uh I I I got to ask one self-interest question, then I want to get to the Ether machine. Um so, one of our holdings is we own PayPal. uh do you know and PayPal is with Andrew Chris he's Alex Chris is trying to be uh innovative and you see to your point like you could send stable coins you could pay with crypto they're the sixth largest issuer of stable coins so they're they're kind of on the cutting edge of this how will they be helped or hurt by these developments uh in your view well so I I think that PayPal is interesting in the sense that you you nailed it that they have been one of the first movers they have a top 10 uh stable coin Uh that said, you know, their business is to kind of sit as an intermediary between, you know, counterparties. Yeah. uh you know what you know I I kind of gave like the technical devil's advocate or proponent to uh you know the thinning of the intermediary layer but there are there are kind of fundamental ad values that a company like PayPal has like let's call it like the govern uh the global regulatory compliance that they have you know in you know a 100 different jurisdictions uh like that money transmission business I think is is something that that they're going to have kind of incumbent upon them. But I think that you're going to you're going to see a thinning. PayPal, Mastercard, Ammex, you know, where where you're able to do this and basically the AML KYC is going to be done uh at the identity layer instead of at the intermediary layer. So basically, in order to transact, you're going to have to have your wallet that that is the Tom wallet, not the PayPal wallet, and KYC approved. And and and basically, you'll have to have attributes about yourself. So facts about yourself. Maybe it's your uh bank statement or or your mortgage that that that deems exactly where you live for AMLKYC. And then like attributes about yourself or excuse me, attestations about yourself. to like your reputation, you know, does Tom have good credit? Does is Tom good in different transactions? And then you're going to have this self-s sovereign digital identity where it's owned by the individual rather than owned by the intermediary. So, you know, a good example of this is if you take 10,000 Ubers and you get five stars because you're a gentleman and you want to go rent an Airbnb, that reputation of your 10,000 five-star uh transactions is not portable. And I bet if you take 10,000 nice Ubers, uh when you go to rent uh your Airbnb, you'd probably be a pretty good tenant of the house. But that reputational attribute doesn't kind of sit with you. So what we're going to see is is is this technology creates a self-s sovereign based internet rather than logging into Facebook or logging into PayPal or logging into the these other apps. um we're going to start seeing the user have more uh sovereignty and and power. So I I think the way to think about it and correct me if I'm wrong is like the PayPal that have networks of 438 million people in the short term they're going to benefit from this transition in that they're the first mover and that if I want to pay for something with stablecoin or or or crypto or whatever it's it's there. So for like the next three years they're going to be like the innovator. when we look four or five years out that mar they're gonna have margin compression as as they're whittleled away and by then we'll be out at a double. So uh on to the All right now to the Ethereum machine why we're here. Explain why you set it up, how you set up and uh what what what it does and what it can become. Great. So with with uh before explaining the Ether machine, we have to just kind of touch on a little aspect to Ether the asset. So, so we talked about Ethereum, this next generation substrate of the internet and and basically for every computational step, it requires a micro payment of a digital oil or digital fuel called ether. And and and part of this is that uh with Bitcoin, the way that uh the network is secured is through what's called proof of work, which simply put is actors have to spend money on real estate, hardware, and electricity to solve math problems to basically validate transactions. So basically, if if you wanted to be a Bitcoin miner, you would have to spend money on hardware, real estate, and electricity, and then you could solve math problems and and then get rewarded in Bitcoin. Ethereum works a little bit differently. Uh, and it works through what's called proof of stake. And and what this does is Ethereum doesn't need hardware, real estate, and electricity, but you one needs a stake or or or basically to post a bond. and then to validate a transaction and this is kind of a technical uh feat uh and and then they are generated in yield in ether. So where bitcoin is kind of unproductive this digital gold asset ether is productive a in the sense that one needs it like oil for these transactions and two in the sense that it can generate its own intrinsic yield. when when when when going through you know how does a public market ex uh participant that's not necessarily a computer scientist get exposure to this asset there are different kind of thought processes that one could think about so first and foremost there are ETFs and right now in America uh and it's mostly a relic of the gensler era uh the ETFs do not have the yield that Ether generates through proof of stake and that's like basically buying a stock that has a dividend but not availing yourself to the dividend. Wow. We do think that uh in time they will have the ability to stake but if we look at the ETPs in Canada or Europe as a proxy what we're seeing is that the ETPs can only stake at 50% capacity. M so that means if you have a billion dollars in a Canadian ETP they're only staking 50% which is 500 million and on that they're only earning what I would call the vanilla yield which is basically kind of the floor uh yield which is about 3% on half of the assets. So it's really on the billion dollars you're earning one and a half percent. Right? And with with this vehicle we're able to and the reason why that happens is it's a technical nuance and without boring everybody if one were to unstake their ether today it would take a couple days uh to to get one's ether back. But if, god forbid, a black swan event were to happen in the world and 50% of stakers wanted to unstake at the same time. Yeah. Couple days would grow from to 6 months or a year. Yeah. And and and so that doesn't jive well with the 24-hour redemption requirements of ETPs, ETFs. And so the and and this is uh denominated in Ether. It's not even dollar denominated. So you can't like underwrite this or insure it or market make it. You just basically can only stake at 50% capacity. So first and foremost in the ETFs you would basically be staking at 50% capacity. Yeah. And there are other things that we can do and that's really kind of one of three buckets of active management of this asset which is so the first is staking and then the next is what's called reststaking where you can use Ethereum's proofofstake protocol and to and use it to secure other networks and we could add additional yield that way. And then there's this decentralized financial economy that's been put on top of Ethereum. this $250 billion uh economy that will be growing to trillions. Yeah. Over the next uh decades and you can use ether as let's call it pristine collateral and you can earn additional yield there. So where where the ETFs back of the napkin are earning you know 1 and a half% we believe we can materially outperform uh that by employing active risk management. And so we think that this is the right vehicle, a public operating company is the right vehicle to actively manage Ether. And then there's kind of kind of two paths to go by. One could deploy into a shell company, which is done via reverse takeover, or the vehicle we chose, which is a spec. Uh so and and so simply put, I I anchored this vehicle with my own uh personal balance sheet and and I'm deploying $645 million of Ether into this uh because I wouldn't suggest anyone else do something that I'm not willing to do myself and I want to lead by example. That's about 15 times uh any other uh vehicle in in the space in terms of a a founders's commitment. Wow. So, so all these other guys that that are in the same space but not able to generate the same yield that you've been doing at Dharma, by the way, it's not like you're like, \"Oh, I have this idea how we can get more yield.\" You've actually been doing it for years with your own capital and now you're deploying and 600 million sounds like an enormous amount of money, but it's a minority for for you. I mean, but it's material. Uh, and that's that's a critical thing that I look for in management. What what skin do they have in the in the game? And number one, I co-invested because I I like you and we're friends and I'm betting on the jockey. But two, it's like he's putting a real I mean significant amount of money in his own idea. Um uh so so so talk a little bit about how that differentiates you from the other uh players in it and then um we we can talk about how people can find it and and learn more. Yeah. So, so simply put, I started looking at this from first principles and I said if I wanted to deploy capital, so so I was already doing this in a private context, but basically the the difference is now in a public vehicle, I'm able to access the public equity markets and the public debt markets, right? Yeah. Could basically borrow to to acquire more ether or I could sell equity to acquire more ether. And when I started looking at it, there was, you know, generally speaking, two ways to do this. One would be I could reverse take over a dying pick your poison, a dying biotech, a dying gambling company, a dying Bitcoin miner, you know, some dying micro cap that had a pre-existing operating business, uh, pre-existing liabilities, pre-existing management that I would still have to pay, uh, you know, all of that. you know, I wanted pure play exposure to Ethereum and and and to be able to choose my operating team uh and and and solely focus on that. I didn't want to have a shadow management team, shadow liabilities, shadow debts, uh and and have 80% exposure to Ethereum and 20% to this pre-existing operating business. Um and and and so we went down the route of creating a denovo entity. So a brand new LLC where we've anchored with capital uh and and then basically that will go through a business combination uh with the uh with a special purpose acquisition company that has no pre-existing operating company uh to to deal with. And then basically this is the sole pure play exposure to Ethereum and Etherdenominated yield where we have chosen handpicked our management team wi-i which are essentially the avengers of Ethereum you know the best-in-class operators uh to to to actively manage this risk for institutional and mainstream investors and and we just completed uh a capital raise in in the form of a private placement and a pipe. Yeah. It is the largest common equity uh raise uh in the last five years. So over $1.5 billion and and the market has agreed with us and and so now um the the the there's exposure available through the ticker Dynx. Okay. Which is Dynamics uh Corporation. Um and and that is going to uh we are going through the SC uh SEC S4 registration right now and and and basically in a couple months uh that will evolve into the Ether Machine Inc. and and and and we will have an active operating business of acquiring and professionally managing Ether. That's amazing. And and if you look at uh Micro Strategy as an example, you know, Ether, Ethereum is still scarce, right? Like Bitcoin. So So there's that. Um he's been able to in the Micro Strategy vehicle, which he still has the operating company, but whatever. Issue a lot of lowcost debt and converts to buy up more of this scarce resource that only has that one value you said of send, whereas yours has unlimited values of banks and stable coins. And you know I I look at stable coins because it's going from 250 billion to two trillion demand which is going to lower rates which helps my housing plays. So I I think of it in a different thing but it's going to help demand for treasuries. It's also going to be uh the productivity is going to be deflationary and all all that taking the friction out increasing the velocity like what you said. Um so so I think of it in that that term. Are you guys thinking in the scheme of what Michael Sailor is doing or maybe like a more conservative version of that to accumulate at the right times and the right prices? So like you can issue equity. Let's say if you know Ethereum doubles in two months and you say, \"Ah, this is a little ahead of itself. Now's the time to issue equity.\" Or if if if capital's cheap, rates go down, let's issue debt because that makes sense. H how do you guys think about that? So So great question. What what I'd say is that broadly speaking, MSTR pioneered what I would consider a positive sum game where they were able to issue convertible debt to hedge funds acquiring volatility and they would basically use that convertible debt or or or the proceeds of that to buy the underlying asset in their case Bitcoin for shareholders that wanted Bitcoin exposure leveraged. Yeah. And and and I think that, you know, the devil's in the details and t\n\nhere is  a MNAV of the Micro Strategy stock that's greater than four they would aggressively sell equity. If it's between two and a half to four, they would opportunistically sell equity. If it's under two and a half times, they would not sell equity because that gets to a point where it starts being dilutive to shareholders rather than accreative. we will be relying more on the debt markets than the equity markets. Furthermore, this is another reason why we went with this denovo entity. So when you you have to underwrite you counterparties, let's call it the the hedge fund world, you know, let's AQR, Jane Street, Millennium, etc. that could be your convertible bond issuing counterparty. They're going to underwrite each one of these vehicles. And I think they'd rather underwrite something denovo with no legacy liabilities, no legacy operating companies, no legacy governance, um no legacy management team where you're going to have this kind of leakage. versus something that's clean. we think that for the let's call it medium to long term, this is the right vehicle to do so. the spread arbitrage. So in Bitcoin, you don't have that. What you have is a bet that people are going to pay you more for a scarce sendonly asset. Whereas in Ethereum, you're betting on the flywheel of more and more usage based on more stable coin, based on more applications, etc. But the three buckets that you talked about in terms of generating yield, it's very easy to it will be very easy at certain points in the marketplace to issue debt with a yield lower than a conservative yield you can generate on an ongoing basis. which implies if you're if you're maximizing a balance sheet, you you can be aggressive at certain points when the spread is wide because not issuing at th those points in time um would would would be bad for all shareholders, but namely you as the largest, right? Why wouldn't you take that spread all day long if the yield that you can generate is with con conservatism is meaningfully higher than what you pay for that debt, right? So, so, so you you absolutely nailed it. I mean, I think bit bottom line is this is a better treasury asset than Bitcoin due to the yield that could, you know, conceivably uh pay that zero coupon indefinitely. PS, it's double the V of Bitcoin. So, you know, so so there's another carrot in there for the VA seeking hedge funds um that are buying the convertible bonds. So, not only does it uh generate that yield, it has double the volatility. will you ever use this uh I guess never say never like as a as a birkure of Ethereum applications, meaning you got all this yield coming in, you got this appreciation, you have access to the capital markets. Would you ever look at like, hey, uh the next circle that's going to be a application on top of Ethereum and you're like, this is a slam dunk. We want to partic as the premier Ethereum reserve machine. We want to participate in that because we know that's going to be a five bagger or whatever. Do we take some of that yield and buy equity in some of these things on top of it or is that not in the immediate plans and open for discussion in the future kind of thing. So So what I would start with Well, first and foremost, we've got to start with getting the S4 registration done and getting us out the door, right?\n\n### HEADLINES_AND_NEWS\nwhether or not BLS data is useful as an investor or investment and or trading indicator? Yeah, I would say two two things. One, biggest revision, uh, two-month revision since 2013, multimonth revisions going back 50 years. So whether there was a political motivation or not a political motivation, I have no idea. That's speculation. But, uh, you know, if you're building a house and, you know, you're you're 4T off from where the the baseboard should go, uh, you've got a structural problem for years. So, she's just simply incompetent. she wasn't bringing in the right technology or the right people to uh narrow that margin of safety to get accurate data. So just simple incompetence was a uh good enough reason to fire her and and move on and get someone credibility credible in there that's going to take action to reform and update and upgrade uh the data collection and dissemination. So I I I think that's number one. The second part of your question, >> let's take a look at what uh Dallio said here. Uh I probably would have fired the head of the BLS2. That's because this process for making estimates is obviously error uh uh errorprone and obsolete. T\n### MISCELLANEOUS\nno good plan in the works for fixing it. Well, if it's errorprone and obsolete, why are we using it as any sort of trading indicator at all? >> Well, one uh I don't use it I I I think this is in the in the scheme of short-term voting machine, long-term weighing machine. like these revisions eventually get it right. So if you're using it on a trading on a month-to-month or week- toeek basis, which we don't do, uh then yes, this data is really not helpful and potentially harmful to to your outlook. If you're an investor and you're looking at the free cash flow of a company and the revenue growth and the moat, uh it's completely meaningless because you will have after a few months the the correct numbers. Uh I think what Dallio is saying based on that article that you just posted is exactly what I'm saying. Something is is wrong regardless of the motivation you need someone to upgrade the systems and improve the data collection and dissemination. Uh and if there was any uh issue political bias etc that's another reason but that can't be proven at the moment and it's irrelevant. The key is the output is insufficient and not acceptable. >> Well, the bigger picture then on the jobs numbers, do um do the job numbers indicate any significant meaningful slowdown in uh employment activity thereby potentially lowering uh margins and weakening earnings for this quarter or next. Yeah, look, I think you know if you look at the revisions going back multi-months that was a period of significant uncertainty. So it might be the lagged effect cuz what you've seen since then is seuite confidence after liberation day was kind of resolved the market started to recover. uh you're seeing CEO confidence come back. As a matter of fact, last week was the biggest week in years for deal activity, M&A, uh etc. That the the uh investment bankers in the Hamptons aren't playing golf. They're busy on the phones in August, which is pretty unusual. So, animal spirits have come back. Uh, and I think that um it might be more of a rear view looking mirror phenomenon, but it's also a message to the Fed like, hey, you really are too restrictive and you really are too late because once the unemployment starts to tick up, it's very very hard to put that genie back in the bottle. Uh, inflation on the other hand, you can quell pretty quickly. So in other words, when you think about riskreward in terms of a dual mandate, let's assume this trend persists and the weakening job market uh persists and it wasn't solely attributable to liberation day and the uncertainty around liberation day, well then you're probably already too late with cuts. Uh however, if it is a short-term phenomenon and let's say you cut too early and all of a sudden employment starts roaring back with with CEO confidence and seauite confidence and inflation ticks up because uh you cut too quickly. Well, it's very easy to quell inflation. You could you could simply do a a hike of 25 or 50 basis points and put inflation back in the jar. You can't do a cut, you know, 25 basis point cut and put unemployment uh uh back in the jar. It just continues to persist and fear builds upon fear builds upon fear. And then you wind up having to go with, you know, if it's a serious recession, a half a trillion dollar, multiundred billion dollar stimulus to get the economy back on track and that worsens the deficit. So, uh, t\n\n### MISCELLANEOUS\nlook, I think you know if you look at the revisions going back multi-months that was a period of significant uncertainty.

So, uh, t\n\n\nUm, so if there's no downside to cut too soon, hypothetically, uh, and there's massive downside to stay restrictive and be too late Powell, well, you you have to take that into account. And now where you have the one governor resigning, you have dissent on the Fed. Uh for a guy that's so concerned about his legacy, uh now he's kind of boxed because if he's if he's right, he still has a legacenting him holding rates high. Um, and if he's wrong, he's totally screwed because everyone knew he's too late. Powell. So, uh, he's he's in a box now. He's got his out with this latest jobs report and he can use this to save face and pivot at Jackson Hole. The question is, will he or will he stay belligerent Powell and trying to uh kind of get back at the president? But that that doesn't help the world. It doesn't help the country and it certainly doesn't help those people uh that are in the labor market for sure. \n### MISCELLANEOUS\n>> I think we've got to go at least two. And I think that's all we're going to get. Uh we should probably do 75 to 100 basis points. That's kind of neutral. And that gives you enough cushion in case uh Powell's prophecy of uh inflation being more than a a one-off uh uh comes out to be true. Uh I I I think that's the right level. You know, if you look at housing being 16% of GDP, uh he's really put that in a box and that's that's hurting a tremendous amount of the population. You know, our largest portion of the population is the millennials and the uh average age of home buying has gone from first-time home buying has gone from 28 to now 38. That's put their whole lives on hold. That's that's um kind of um reduced the incentive to have children. If you can't afford a house, why are you going to have kids? And a lot of that generation because of Powell have now resigned themselves to not having children, not having the joy of family formation, not having the joy of a starter home, not having an ownership stake. So there are a lot of unintended consequences created by a guy who's interested in how he's written and not being Arthur Burns, which the current economic state has no resemblance to the conditions that Arthur Burns faced in the 70s, demographically, economically, or otherwise. It's a shame. Uh, you know, if you had said to me, David, uh, you know, six years ago, would you rather have a successful business person running the Fed or an academic? I would have said, business person, hands down. Uh, I I I was wrong. Uh, I give me the PhDs out the wazoo that actually understand the e uh uh economy or at least understand how to manage a central bank. I I think Powell would have been an incredible Treasury Secretary. I think he's a generally good, competent person. I don't think he has the skill set for the job. >> Uh, moving on from the Fed, do you think markets generally speaking are more recepted to Fed policy now or fiscal policy and especially trade certainty? In other words, what are the biggest triggers going forward for the rest of the year? >> I think the tariff policy is a headwind. I think the one big beautiful bill is a tailwind that's not yet priced in. So the shortterm negative effects of the tariff policy are being offset by the one big beautiful bill which is not fully priced in. So I think it's a it's a net positive allin uh and therefore I do think the economy reacelerates and what we found also you know going up 50% on India and and far 250% on pharmaceuticals and all this other stuff. What we know about this administration is they will bend things but not break them. They will bend them as far as they can get. But if if the bond market and the stock market starts to look uh like it's breaking like we saw in early April, they quickly uh show flexibility and rationality and they reverse those positions. So they want to get as much as they can without breaking things. And I think the intent of the administration and and rightfully so is for the economy to do as well as possible. And candidly, uh, President Trump does measure his success by what the Dow does. And, uh, he's not going to let it go to that far down because it's not helpful to people's retirements. It's not helpful to confidence. It's not helpful to animal spirits. And he wants to see it grow. And what we're seeing with real wages now coming back to levels not seen since his first term is Main Street is doing tremendously better than they did uh, prior to him coming in in the last four years. as Main Street real wages are reacelerating again and people on Main Street are doing better. >> Your overall thesis for the rest of the year in notes that you sent me, you reiterated your uh long stance and you wrote that um dips are to be bought. Sit on your hands and do nothing. You said uh elaborate. So >> yeah, we're look we're in the seasonally weak part of the year. August, September, October, everyone knows. So everyone's looking for a big correction. And I think what they're going to be disappointed with certainly those looking for big corrections 10 or 20% are going to be sorely disappointed because uh on average you get a 20% bare market correction every 3.5 years. We've had three in the last 5 years. So we've pulled forward 10.5 years of bare market corrections. uh uh I do think that uh you know 3 to 5 to 8% corrections are possible after a 30 something% move off the off the lows but what you have to keep in mind is uh there was record selling in the whole a trillion dollars of equities were sold the day before liberation day predominantly hedge funds institutional managers you know who got it right was the retail investors and they've gotten it right every single dip since co they've been buyers not sellers institutions and hedge funds have been wrong and now they're all dramatically behind their benchmark. So they can't buy the things that are already up. Uh they have to buy the lagards in an effort and they got to do it with leverage in an effort to catch up to their benchmark and keep their jobs. Which is why you have seen in the last 7 8 weeks one of the biggest pockets of outperformance 11% more than the S&P 500 has been the most shorted stocks. the most hated stocks, those lagards that um have been the last to move have now started to outperform and I think that's going to be the theme. So if we see some volatility in in the indices basically now if you talk about the S&P 500 you're just talking about MAG 7 and what did we see with MAG7 earnings the six or so that have reported is they were good okay but they're decelerating so last year 33% this quarter 14% earnings growth uh by Q3 next quarter what no one's really talking about it's going to be the first time that they're that earnings growth of the MAG 7 is 10% or slightly below 10% earnings growth. So why does that matter? It matters because the multiples relative to the earnings growth have not come down. If you look at the Microsoft's uh 10 10% earnings growth, 33 times multiple, the uh Amazon's 31 times multiple 8 12%. Are they great businesses? You bet. Are you paying up a little more than you should based on the earnings growth and certainly in a decelerating earnings growth environment? Yes. Contrast that with something like the small cap indices which will dramatically benefit from the uh reinitiation of Fed cuts more than anyone else because they've got the most leverage. And if you look at earnings growth for 2026, uh small Russell 2000 expected earnings growth is 37%. that's excluding the benefit in terms of their debt servicing when rates start to come down 50 75 basis points versus the S&P 500 at 14% earnings growth. Uh and furthermore, you're getting a much lower multiple still on small caps with more than double the earnings growth than you are on the S&P 500. So managers will have no choice but to start to buy those, start to buy the unmagnificent 493. So, if you're saying, \"Oh, do I buy the S&P 500 index right now?\" Which is basically saying, \"Oh, do I buy MAG 7 right now?\" I think you're going to be disappointed. You're probably going to be net up. So, if we get, you know, three, five, eight, 7, 8% uh volatility in the next few months. Maybe you do, maybe you don't. I think there are so many people off sides. I think the surprise would be that we actually push higher and don't get any material correction which would be the maximum pain trade right now because people are not positioned for that. More people are lightening up or behind the benchmark than are overweight and giddy right now. If you look at all the sentiment indicators, some are a little bit elevated, but they're not really giddy, which which kind of implies to me the the pain trade going into the fall with everyone looking at seasonal weaknesses, maybe we get more strength than expected, but certainly in the places that no one's focused on would be my bet. >> I wonder if they're more expensive because they're the best inclass businesses. And so if you're paying a bit of a premium on on valuations, it's because you're buying better businesses which would in theory outperform\nthe last any any period longer small cap value is the highest performer. So you know and that goes for value generally speaking. the the data got skewed in a in a period of 15 years of ZERP. So unless you're betting on ZERP coming back, uh that's probably not your highest and best use. And if you go back a h 100red years uh and you think about do I allocate you know 100% of my money to value or 100% of my money to growth. Well, if you put a million dollar in value versus growth uh in 1928 uh value you would have $68 million more dollars today because it outperforms on average about 4% not in aggregate 4% per year compounded over a hundred years. uh where people are sideways is like they were in the late 90s which is that growth has outperformed the last you know 10 years in this case therefore it's going to outperform forever uh and I think what people miss is a a great example is Amazon when you look at the palunteers and different great companies of the world Amazon was one of the greatest companies in 1999 and 2000 and we were all betting that what they said was going to happen in the future would happen in the future, which would be it would be the store of everything. They would deliver everything to your house. It would all be online, etc. And guess what? They did everything they said they were going to do over the next 15 years. The problem is uh in 1999 and 2000, you were paying for them already having delivered that 15 years of value at that time, 15 years early. So what happened over the next three years? Amazon stock was down 90% from 2000 to 2002 2003 and it wasn't down 90% from 2002 to 2002 2003 because we were in a recession okay because the fundamentals of Amazon's business in each of those years 2000 2001 2002 2003 continued to improve revenues continued to improve cash flow continued to improve earnings continue to improve the price of the stock went down 90%. Why would that happen? It happened because Amazon was a great company. Amazon is a great company. The problem was the short-term voting machine, the emotional voting machine was 15 years too early. You were paying for 15 years of performance uh 15 years too early. And therefore, the stock price had to correct to where the fundamentals actually were, not to where they would be. And then by the time as we got closer to 15 years out and all the things they said they were going to do in 2000 were actually happening, the price caught back up. And I think we're seeing that with a number of these super high-flying stocks right now that are doing unbelievable things and will be doing even better things 5 10 15 years out. The question is are you already paying for it? And will you have a reckoning in the intermediate term when the market says, \"Yeah, they're great.\" But you've already paid for the next 20 years of seamless perfect execution. So if they if they come in 1% lower than the perfect execution, you're not going to get a 1% pullback. You're going to get an 80% pullback. And those are the type of stocks we want to avoid. And what we want to do is look for our turnaround time specials that are durable, predictable businesses that have been generating cash for, you know, decades and have predictable trend lines of cash flow and uh and uh uh revenues that have a temporary dislocation because they're out of favor due to rates or due to sector dislocation. Where the short-term voting machine price is not pricing in 15 years of greatness. it's pricing in that they're going out of business and there's no way in hell they're going out of business. So therefore, when people when the mood shifts and the flavor of the month, the stock market, you know, it's like the stock market's like BaskinRobins. What's the flavor of the month? Right now, it's not those great companies that uh when that comes back into vogue and Rocky Road is back in flavor. You get doubles and triples in 24, 36 months. And that's what we like to do. Rinse and repeat over and over. Boring, durable businesses that furthermore, we can allocate massive amounts of capital. We can take 10% positions. You can't take a 10% position with a company that's trading at 100 times sales unless you're a cowboy and you're reckless because at some point maybe it'll double again. But you're gambling. You know, you have no downside protection because when it when the music stops on those names, it's not a a 3% pullback. It's a everyone rushes to the exit at the same time because there's no fundamental underpinning for the current price even if the businesses are fantastic. \n### MISCELLANEOUS\n>> Are there in the universe of Tom special stocks? Are there any uh sectors or subsectors within the AI infrastructure trade that would fit the criteria of not being super overvalued right now? In other words, AI infrastructure, how would you play that besides just buying those AI stocks outright? Yeah, I mean look, that's not a core theme for us because we think the actual key beneficiaries are going to be the >> companies that implement the AI which are not yet priced in the efficiencies and the margin improvement and the productivity and the margin expansion that's going to come to regular everyday business is not yet reflected. So if we're buying great businesses, they're going to become greater business with with the advent of AI. But in terms of like simple exposure to the theme, we like energy. Okay. So one of the names that we have around 78 bucks is Comtock Resources. Uh Jerry Jones owns the majority of the stock, 70 plus% of the stock. We're co-investors with him. Somewhere around $8 a share. It went up to $30 a share. It's now at $17. We're in the market buying more. it's going to 50 over the next two to three years. So, that's a no-brainer for us, continual uh demand for energy. Uh the other backdrop you need with all the data centers is generators. So, GenerRack has been a huge hit for us. Um uh started buying that thing below 100, shot up to 190, corrected, now it's back uh knocking on the door of 200. That probably goes to 250, 300 plus. Uh that's another energy play. I think the dark horse in all of this, I know there's a lot of noise around Intel and everyone's saying it's a, you know, baggy, you know what, but the fact of the matter is, you heard it from Trump yesterday, they've got to produce chips in the in the US and they're the only game in town. Yes, Taiwan Semiconductor has fabs and they can invest in that, but they want to invest in Intel. Intel and Lip Bhutan, that's going to be the dark horse surprise in the next 48 months. You can't give the stock away right now. If they liquidated it tomorrow, you get a 100% of your money back. Uh, and if on their legacy business, it's worth 40 45 $50. And if they actually get their production in gear, which now they've got a partner in the government going to have to backstock stop them. And Lit Bhutan, who at Cadence Designs had like a 50 plus bagger. This guy knows how to do turnarounds. He knows everyone in the industry. He's going to get it right. You wind up with a $100 stock. And that's something that I can sleep like a baby at night because I know what my downside is and my upside's unlimited. If they get half of their projections right versus buying something that's already priced for absolute perfection and then, you know, if they if they miss by 1%, the stock's down 50%. So, I'd rather buy it when it's already down that much and then get my doubles and triples versus holding on with white knuckles and praying to God that the next earnings call they don't, you know, wrinkle their nose the wrong way and everyone runs for the exits. \n### HEADLINES_AND_NEWS\n>> Here's another piece of news that I'd like you to comment on. So, the Trump brothers, uh, Donald Trump's sons are now, uh, backing manufacturing spack, filing for $300 million US IPO. Uh, it's going to be called New America Acquisition uh, Corp. Uh, New America said in the filing that it aims to buy businesses with a combined enterprise value of 700 million or more and will target companies that play a meaningful role in revitalizing domestic manufacturing, expanding innovation ecosystems and strengthening critical supply chains. Is that are those themes that you're so interested in as a manager? >> Yes. Yeah. I think I think the reshoring is going to be a key theme. I look I think they're playing a lot of the thematic plays. They're obviously heavy in crypto. I was at the New York Stock Exchange. They were um promoting some gun company. So, you know, they're they've got their hands in a lot of pots. But I do think that theme of uh manufacturing resurgence in the US is a durable theme. And some of these technologies, whether it's AI, robotics, whether it's uh uh are going to help accelerate that because what what largely makes the US uncompetitive is regulations and labor costs. So Trump is going to gut the regulations and some of these technologies uh brought to you by robotics brought to you by AI. I mean we're seeing it in one holding we have GXO Logistics which uh which Brad Jacobs uh was one of Brad Jacobs spin-offs one of the greatest wealth creators for stockholders in history whether it was Waste Connections, United Rentals, XPO, now he's got QXO and he has GXO. uh they're one of the biggest utilizers of these humanoid type of robots in their warehouses. Not not the Tesla ones, but other companies make great robots. Uh and they will continue to benefit and that's a huge scaled business with one of the largest logistics providers in the world and uh warehousing and uh um uh etc. Shipping return they they handle returns for major companies. So uh I think you're going to see more and more of that and as the GXOs of the world can implement more of this automation their margins are going to go up and up and up which is going to uh giving give them price uh competition and scale where they can just squeeze out all the competitors over time. So I want to be in those forwardinking companies that are actually utilizing the technology versus the ones that are creating it and trying to guess who's the winner. I I'd rather bet on sure durable businesses that have a free option of massive margin expansion by utilizing the technologies versus gambling on who's going to get the technology right. >> Okay. And then\n\nUm, so if there's no downside to cut too soon, hypothetically, uh, and there's massive downside to stay restrictive and be too late Powell, well, you you have to take that into account. And now where you have the one governor resigning, you have dissent on the Fed. Uh for a guy that's so concerned about his legacy, uh now he's kind of boxed because if he's if he's right, he still has a legacenting him holding rates high. Um, and if he's wrong, he's totally screwed because everyone knew he's too late. Powell. So, uh, he's he's in a box now. He's got his out with this latest jobs report and he can use this to save face and pivot at Jackson Hole. The question is, will he or will he stay belligerent Powell and trying to uh kind of get back at the president? But that that doesn't help the world. It doesn't help the country and it certainly doesn't help those people uh that are in the labor market for sure. \n### MISCELLANEOUS\n>> I think we've got to go at least two. And I think that's all we're going to get. Uh we should probably do 75 to 100 basis points. That's kind of neutral. And that gives you enough cushion in case uh Powell's prophecy of uh inflation being more than a a one-off uh uh comes out to be true. Uh I I I think that's the right level. You know, if you look at housing being 16% of GDP, uh he's really put that in a box and that's that's hurting a tremendous amount of the population. You know, our largest portion of the population is the millennials and the uh average age of home buying has gone from first-time home buying has gone from 28 to now 38. That's put their whole lives on hold. That's that's um kind of um reduced the incentive to have children. If you can't afford a house, why are you going to have kids? And a lot of that generation because of Powell have now resigned themselves to not having children, not having the joy of family formation, not having the joy of a starter home, not having an ownership stake. So there are a lot of unintended consequences created by a guy who's interested in how he's written and not being Arthur Burns, which the current economic state has no resemblance to the conditions that Arthur Burns faced in the 70s, demographically, economically, or otherwise. It's a shame. Uh, you know, if you had said to me, David, uh, you know, six years ago, would you rather have a successful business person running the Fed or an academic? I would have said, business person, hands down. Uh, I I I was wrong. Uh, I give me the PhDs out the wazoo that actually understand the e uh uh economy or at least understand how to manage a central bank. I I think Powell would have been an incredible Treasury Secretary. I think he's a generally good, competent person. I don't think he has the skill set for the job. >> Uh, moving on from the Fed, do you think markets generally speaking are more recepted to Fed policy now or fiscal policy and especially trade certainty? In other words, what are the biggest triggers going forward for the rest of the year? >> I think the tariff policy is a headwind. I think the one big beautiful bill is a tailwind that's not yet priced in. So the shortterm negative effects of the tariff policy are being offset by the one big beautiful bill which is not fully priced in. So I think it's a it's a net positive allin uh and therefore I do think the economy reacelerates and what we found also you know going up 50% on India and and far 250% on pharmaceuticals and all this other stuff.

And what we're seeing with real wages now coming back to levels not seen since his first term is Main Street is doing tremendously better than they did uh, prior to him coming in in the last four years. as Main Street real wages are reacelerating again and people on Main Street are doing better. >> Your overall thesis for the rest of the year in notes that you sent me, you reiterated your uh long stance and you wrote that um dips are to be bought. Sit on your hands and do nothing. You said uh elaborate. So >> yeah, we're look we're in the seasonally weak part of the year. August, September, October, everyone knows. So everyone's looking for a big correction. And I think what they're going to be disappointed with certainly those looking for big corrections 10 or 20% are going to be sorely disappointed because uh on average you get a 20% bare market correction every 3.5 years. We've had three in the last 5 years. So we've pulled forward 10.5 years of bare market corrections. uh uh I do think that uh you know 3 to 5 to 8% corrections are possible after a 30 something% move off the off the lows but what you have to keep in mind is uh there was record selling in the whole a trillion dollars of equities were sold the day before liberation day predominantly hedge funds institutional managers you know who got it right was the retail investors and they've gotten it right every single dip since co they've been buyers not sellers institutions and hedge funds have been wrong and now they're all dramatically behind their benchmark.

So why does that matter? It matters because the multiples relative to the earnings growth have not come down. If you look at the Microsoft's uh 10 10% earnings growth, 33 times multiple, the uh Amazon's 31 times multiple 8 12%. Are they great businesses? You bet. Are you paying up a little more than you should based on the earnings growth and certainly in a decelerating earnings growth environment? Yes. Contrast that with something like the small cap indices which will dramatically benefit from the uh reinitiation of Fed cuts more than anyone else because they've got the most leverage. And if you look at earnings growth for 2026, uh small Russell 2000 expected earnings growth is 37%. that's excluding the benefit in terms of their debt servicing when rates start to come down 50 75 basis points versus the S&P 500 at 14% earnings growth. Uh and furthermore, you're getting a much lower multiple still on small caps with more than double the earnings growth than you are on the S&P 500. So managers will have no choice but to start to buy those, start to buy the unmagnificent 493. So, if you're saying, \"Oh, do I buy the S&P 500 index right now?\" Which is basically saying, \"Oh, do I buy MAG 7 right now?\" I think you're going to be disappointed. You're probably going to be net up. So, if we get, you know, three, five, eight, 7, 8% uh volatility in the next few months. Maybe you do, maybe you don't. I think there are so many people off sides. I think the surprise would be that we actually push higher and don't get any material correction which would be the maximum pain trade right now because people are not positioned for that.

I think the dark horse in all of this, I know there's a lot of noise around Intel and everyone's saying it's a, you know, baggy, you know what, but the fact of the matter is, you heard it from Trump yesterday, they've got to produce chips in the in the US and they're the only game in town. Yes, Taiwan Semiconductor has fabs and they can invest in that, but they want to invest in Intel. Intel and Lip Bhutan, that's going to be the dark horse surprise in the next 48 months. You can't give the stock away right now. If they liquidated it tomorrow, you get a 100% of your money back. Uh, and if on their legacy business, it's worth 40 45 $50. And if they actually get their production in gear, which now they've got a partner in the government going to have to backstock stop them. And Lit Bhutan, who at Cadence Designs had like a 50 plus bagger. This guy knows how to do turnarounds. He knows everyone in the industry. He's going to get it right. You wind up with a $100 stock. And that's something that I can sleep like a baby at night because I know what my downside is and my upside's unlimited. If they get half of their projections right versus buying something that's already priced for absolute perfection and then, you know, if they if they miss by 1%, the stock's down 50%. So, I'd rather buy it when it's already down that much and then get my doubles and triples versus holding on with white knuckles and praying to God that the next earnings call they don't, you know, wrinkle their nose the wrong way and everyone runs for the exits. \n### HEADLINES_AND_NEWS\n>> Here's another piece of news that I'd like you to comment on. So, the Trump brothers, uh, Donald Trump's sons are now, uh, backing manufacturing spack, filing for $300 million US IPO. Uh, it's going to be called New America Acquisition uh, Corp. Uh, New America said in the filing that it aims to buy businesses with a combined enterprise value of 700 million or more and will target companies that play a meaningful role in revitalizing domestic manufacturing, expanding innovation ecosystems and strengthening critical supply chains. Is that are those themes that you're so interested in as a manager? >> Yes. Yeah. I think I think the reshoring is going to be a key theme. I look I think they're playing a lot of the thematic plays. They're obviously heavy in crypto. I was at the New York Stock Exchange. They were um promoting some gun company. So, you know, they're they've got their hands in a lot of pots. But I do think that theme of uh manufacturing resurgence in the US is a durable theme. And some of these technologies, whether it's AI, robotics, whether it's uh uh are going to help accelerate that because what what largely makes the US uncompetitive is regulations and labor costs. So Trump is going to gut the regulations and some of these technologies uh brought to you by robotics brought to you by AI. I mean we're seeing it in one holding we have GXO Logistics which uh which Brad Jacobs uh was one of Brad Jacobs spin-offs one of the greatest wealth creators for stockholders in history whether it was Waste Connections, United Rentals, XPO, now he's got QXO and he has GXO. uh they're one of the biggest utilizers of these humanoid type of robots in their warehouses. Not not the Tesla ones, but other companies make great robots. Uh and they will continue to benefit and that's a huge scaled business with one of the largest logistics providers in the world and uh warehousing and uh um uh etc. Shipping return they they handle returns for major companies. So uh I think you're going to see more and more of that and as the GXOs of the world can implement more of this automation their margins are going to go up and up and up which is going to uh giving give them price uh competition and scale where they can just squeeze out all the competitors over time. So I want to be in those forwardinking companies that are actually utilizing the technology versus the ones that are creating it and trying to guess who's the winner. I I'd rather bet on sure durable businesses that have a free option of massive margin expansion by utilizing the technologies versus gambling on who's going to get the technology right. >> Okay. And then\n\nI think if you look through history and you over the last hundred years, any country, any region, pretty much when you have at the bulk of your population in their mid30s, that is the period when they do the most consumption, family formation, housing formation. It has been delayed by bad policies by Jay Powell, but it's pent up and I think that's that's durable and it tends to drive above trend growth and above trend spending, above trend consumption uh at least until their early to mid4s. So our base case is that we are in the second leg of a durable bull market that probably goes into the early 2030s. So any of these three, five, eight, I I I I think we're our pullbacks this year are going to be contained to three to eight% if any. Uh and and as we look out into the 2030s, 20% corrections are to be bought, not sold. Uh and then I I would say things could could meaningfully start to slow like we saw uh you know, 2000 to 2015 as we get get out to the early 2030s into the 2040s. I' I'd be a lot more cautious, but but right now uh if I can find out of favor stocks and sectors with a margin of safety, I'm buying all day long.\n### MISCELLANEOUS\nAre you um positioning for higher beta plays besides the small caps which we talked about? >> Are you looking specifically for more higher beta, more volatile plays in this bull market or are you mostly sticking to um you know beta closer to one? Yeah. >> Yeah. I I don't I don't think in in those terms. I don't think in terms of sharp ratios. I don't think in terms of beta. I think that's that's noise created by consultants. What I do is I look at a business by business basis. And and\n\nearnings were pretty solid for MAG 7 uh is decelerating. So last year was 33%. This quarter was 14% for the Mag 7 that have already reported. We'll get Nvidia in August. But next quarter will be the first quarter that Magnificent 7 earnings growth actually drops below right around 10% maybe a little bit below 10%. That's that's the bad news. The the other bad news is that the multiples have not contracted consistent with the contraction of earnings growth contraction. So uh you've got you know the Microsofts of the world still trading at 33 times PE with 10% earnings growth. You've got the Amazon's trading at 31 times with 8.5% earnings growth. And then you shift over and you look at uh scenarios like uh small caps that are going to have 37% earnings growth in 2026 compared with the S&P 500 at 14 uh 14% earnings growth and yet the multiple for small caps you get more than double the earnings growth for you know meaningfully lower multiple I think that's where the managers are going to be forced to buy. So, you know, put yourself in the position of a hedge fund manager or a long only manager in Boston and, you know, you got nervous. Your clients, you know, told you to sell in in April. We don't know what's going to happen with this crazy crazy leadership or however they phrased it. Uh, and they got it wrong. Uh, and now you've got to catch up to the benchmark, which is now, you know, back to to highs. You can't buy those things that have risen aggressively. So you have to buy those things that have good fundamentals but the price has not yet caught up the the lagards uh that are high quality that are generating free cash less so the the shiny objects although we're still you know we're still seeing that we're still going to see that in pockets. The other thing that I'd like to say because this is a value uh type of theme conference is it's very easy to get caught in the noise right now and think you have to chase the hottest stock in the\n### MISCELLANEOUS\nheadlines . But if you step back uh since 1928, value has outperformed growth by about 4% not in aggregate by about 4% per year compounded. >> So if you had put a million dollar in value versus a million dollars in growth in 1928, you would have $68 million more dollars having invested in value versus investing in growth. And it's easy to get caught because right now you get a lot of guys who look extremely smart in the short term, but if you've been around long enough, they all blow up sooner or later. Uh, you know, there are a handful of growth managers that have outperformed and continue to outperform uh over the long term like Don Baron, but you can count it on, you know, uh, less than one hand. Uh, the guys who chase the shiny objects and live to tell the story. in the short term they can have 200% years and look like uh you know geniuses because you know it's always it's always it's always the same story which is this time it's different. Uh the world has changed. You know the model is different. You're never going to uh that that was the old days and sure enough in the long term uh the market is a weighing machine based on fundamentals. In the short term it's a voting machine based on emotions. So right now you're seeing some people benefit from the short-term voting machine based on emotions and that will continue until it stops and when it stops it stops extremely abruptly versus when you own cashg generative stocks you don't worry about the short-term price fluctuations as long as the uh underlying fundamentals are improving and they're generating cash because when you generate cash you have a huge amount of optionality. You can buy back stock, you can issue dividends, you can buy other companies, you can increase in in uh increase production where you see opportunities to earn above your weighted average cost of capital. Uh so everything's for you and then it's just a waiting game for when uh that style falls back into favor. And I think the conditions are set right now that managers are going to be forced into that style because you can't chase things that are up trading at 100 times sales. I mean, you can do it and try to get the last squeeze out of the lemon, but but good luck because when the air pocket hits, there's no floor. >> It's interesting you bring it up and that's why I was kind of looking off to my screen over here. I've got, you know, I've got IWO, the you know, Russell 2000 growth up about 1.6%, not much. IWN value down 1.9%, S&P 8% give or take. And then you've got a name like Palunteer that as of yesterday was up 112% year to date, 500 and something% in the last year and it's having another spectacular day as we as we do this session. So, you know, talk a little bit more again about the rotation. Is it really just it's going to be that catch-up trade that sort of gets people out of the the hot stuff over here and into the not so hot yet stuff? Is there something going else on like macroeconomically or or you know, fund flow-wise that you're really looking for to make that pivot happen? Yeah, I don't know that it has to be either or. I I think it can be both. And I I think people will want to have a little bit of exposure to the highf flyers to the Mag 7 because uh the recency bias is there. That's what's worked. They expect will continue to work. But I also think that uh if they're behind their benchmarks, they're going to have to have exposure to the things that are just leaving the station uh versus the the things that have uh really flown. And if you look at for instance uh the Boeings, you know, just a four, five, six weeks ago, you couldn't give away the stock at $135. And we're pounding the table on Fox Business and they're looking at me like, you know, trying not to fall asleep and the thing's up double in in 8 weeks. And if you look at the Disneys of the world, you couldn't give away in the low 80s and at 120, people are starting to talk about it. These are stories that are are basically just getting started and and they're they're stories uh Generrack 75% of the home standby generator. I mean, here's a one that got down to the low 100s and now is back up to 195, almost doubles. Uh and those are ones that we like because we can put an enormous amount of money to work and sleep like a baby at night. Like I can't imagine having a stock trading at 100 times sales and putting you know 10% of our portfolio our clients money into that stock and just praying every morning that the market doesn't rerate it to 50 time sales even and even that like I if I told you um you know uh Boeing was trading at 50 times sales or something like that you know I mean obviously the growth rates are different. Obviously, these are these are new high-f flyers, but it's amazing how quickly on the one hand, recency bias causes people to do crazy things. They extrapolate what's happened in the recent past is going to persist indefinitely. And we know if you've been around more than 5 minutes that, you know, the these things wind up in face plants, okay? It's just a matter of time. Uh uh a great example was Amazon.com. Amazon.com in 1999 two 2000 was talking about all the amazing things that they were going to do. Uh they were going to have home delivery. They were going to be the store of everything. You could buy everything online and it would be delivered to your house. Uh and here's the funny thing about Amazon in 1999 and 2000. It was trading whatever it was trading 100 times sales or one of these ridiculous uh multiples. Everything that they promised you that they would do, they have done. But do you know what happened over the next three years? The stock was down 90%. And by the way, during the period that the stock fell 90% from 2000 to 2002 or 2003, the underlying fundamentals of the business got better. It's not like it was down 90% because the sales fell 90%. The fundamentals got better. The problem was when the market wakes up on these shiny object stocks and it realizes that the growth rates may not persist forever or even worse everything that's that we expect is going to happen will happen. The problem is, wait a second, we're already paying for what we think might happen in the best case scenario 20 years from now. And when you're paying for 20 years of perfect execution, if they execute 1% less than perfection and you're already paying for 20 years, t\n\n### MISCELLANEOUS\nknow 10% of our portfolio our clients money into that stock and just praying every morning that the market doesn't rerate it to 50 time sales even and even that like I if I told you um you know uh Boeing was trading at 50 times sales or something like that you know I mean obviously the growth rates are different. Obviously, these are these are new high f flyers, but it's amazing how quickly on the one hand, recency bias causes people to do crazy things. They extrapolate what's happened in the recent past is going to persist indefinitely. And we know if you've been around more than 5 minutes that, you know, the these things wind up in face plants, okay? It's just a matter of time. Uh uh a great example was Amazon.com. Amazon.com in 1999 two 2000 was talking about all the amazing things that they were going to do. Uh they were going to have home delivery. They were going to be the store of everything. You could buy everything online and it would be delivered to your house. Uh and here's the funny thing about Amazon in 1999 and 2000. It was trading whatever it was trading 100 times sales or one of these ridiculous uh multiples. Everything that they promised you that they would do, they have done. But do you know what happened over the next three years? The stock was down 90%. And by the way, during the period that the stock fell 90% from 2000 to 2002 or 2003, the underlying fundamentals of the business got better. It's not like it was down 90% because the sales fell 90%. The fundamentals got better. The problem was when the market wakes up on these shiny object stocks and it realizes that the growth rates may not persist forever or even worse everything that's that we expect is going to happen will happen. The problem is, wait a second, we're already paying for what we think might happen in the best case scenario 20 years from now. And when you're paying for 20 years of perfect execution, if they execute 1% less than perfection and you're already paying for 20 years, t\n\nthe weighing machine wins in the long term. So I can't tell you whether Palunteer goes to 400 time sales or 200 time sales or 100 time sales. I mean there's obviously they're doing things that are special and the question is and they're a great company and they have strong leadership and all that stuff. Um the question is how much of the future lifech changing impact of their product is already priced into the stock today. And this company could do everything that he's talking about for or 10xing the revenues. Uh you know, look, if he 10xes revenues, it's still trading at 10 times sales. So, you know, if it's trading at 100 times now. So, the question is what's the right price? And and uh no one asks that question until there's a little bit of an air pocket in the economy or in the market or in performance or you know candidly the ones that are chasing it because it's up so much are going to be the same ones panicking out when it's down 5%. And then there'll be a different batch that are panicking when it's down 10%. And there'll be a different batch that absolutely puke it out when it's down 20%. And then there are ones that will puke it in the hole down 60%. ### MISCELLANEOUS\nuh when guys like me start to look at it seriously and and take a look at it for the long term and see if there's too much blood in the streets relative to the incredible things that they're doing. So, it's just a different framework and and I would say too, Mike, I think people have this scarce mindset that it has to be either or either you're a growth manager and that's good or you're a value manager and that's bad or or vice versa. And I don't view it that way. I I think you're you're going to have a guest on named Dan Ives. I think he's brilliant and I think he operates in a different framework and a different model that works exceptionally well for him and I like him very much and I listen to what he said what he says and and uh uh and and respect what he says and learn from what he says but I I just operate in a different framework and I'm perfectly comfortable with errors of omission. Okay, this is what I learned from Charlie Mer. Like when God was handing out FOMO jeans, he didn't hand one out to Tom Hayes. So I'm genetically different. I I don't I don't lose a wink of sleep over a stock that's runaway and going crazy that I'm that I'm not participating in. A lot of people do because they see their neighbor, they upgraded from a Toyota to a Hyundai or what whatever the hell happened. like it it doesn't matter because I know in the long term the weighing machine like we do exceptionally well and do following our framework and staying in our lane and sticking with our knitting. ### FEATURED_COMPANY_DEEP_DIVES\nUm and I think that people have to get comfortable maybe you're genetically wired to be a growth investor and just do it better than anyone else. You got uh William O'Neal kind of set the framework. Subscribe to Investors Business Daily. Buy the book How to Make Money in Stocks and you can be a growth investor. Uh if you want to, you know, if if you think more business-like about how to why you buy a piece of a business is for uh a piece of the future cash flow, then you know, you're probably genetically wired to be a better value investor than a growth investor. And it doesn't mean you're different. It just means like, you know, one kid, one of my daughters loves chocolate, one loves vanilla. And it's never going to change. That's just how they're wired. So, accept it. And uh and one's not better than the other. It's just a different framework. And if you want to win at one framework, listen to people who are really good at one framework. Don't listen to me about how to buy the next Palunteer. Listen to me about how to buy Generrack when it's down 70% even though it's got 75% of the home standby generator market and it doubles over a few, you know, couple years. >> Got it. And I I want to leave plenty of time for you to talk about today's picks, but if anybody's listening to this, I do want to point out, I mean, Tom highlighted some of the names that he's been in even longer than he's talked about them at at money show events. But on my screen here, just year to date, for example, Generrack up about 27%, Boeing up about 26%, Advanced Auto Parts was another name up 15%. Uh, and again, these are names that he's been in for a lot longer. So, understand the profit potential is there if you get the timing and the price right. uh even not just relative to the market but relative to some of these great growth names that get the\n\n### MEDIA_APPEARANCE_RECAP\nI had the pleasure to join Brian Sazzy on Yahoo on Monday. Tesla is going to be the the last man standing. They do need Elon Musk and they do need to pivot the company towards humanoid robots and towards robo taxis for it to continue to grow into its current valuation. Tesla is Elon Musk. Elon Musk is Tesla. You take him out of the picture, all that premium goes away. He's the innovator. He's the guy who slept on the factory. He's the guy who took it out of bankruptcy. He's the guy who got the government to give him all the subsidies. Without Elon, candidly, I don't think there is a Tesla.\n\n### MISCELLANEOUS\nEquities XUS are up 16% and change 16 17% S&P up 6%. There's a lot of spend going on with Magnificent 7. Earnings growth was about 14% for MAG7 that has reported but that's down from 33% earnings growth last year and next quarter will be the first quarter that earnings growth for MAG 7 actually goes below 10% but the multiples haven't contracted so if you look at Amazon 31 times PE with low double digits earnings growth you look at Microsoft 30 31% 31 times PE with 8% earnings growth so you're seeing the earnings growth compress as they spend more and more on capex. With the weight of the MAG 7 and the S&P 500, you're going to continue to see some international outperformance in the back half of the year.\n\nhere is the US flash report automotive sales, uh, by month. They crushed it in July relative to last year and the year before. Pretty much one, two, three, four, five out of the last seven months has been a big outperformance from the year before. So when you see Cooper Sander taking down industry volumes because of the wherever they get their data from S&P uh has taken it down, I think that will wind up being too conservative and I think their guidance as a result will wind up being too conservative and that's what we want is massive upside surprises like we saw in the most recent quarter. Um, US consumer confidence. These are times when it pays to be a buyer, not a seller. Markets don't have secular tops when consumer confidence is this low. They have secular tops when it's super high, like 200 um 2006, 2021. Uh this is the lowest it's been since the 2009 and 2011 lows, the debt crisis and the great financial crisis. And then going back from there, you have to go back to 1979 and 1974, which were major lows. So, we like this setup. Let's go over to some um\n### MISCELLANEOUS\nSloomer stuff because he does a good job here uh illustrating what I've been talking about for a long time, the last five years about being in a secular bull, which I now think we're about halfway through. And this will resolve probably in the early 2030s. And you can see here going back a hundred years you got 15 20 years of sideways consolidation in the 30s followed by 15 20 years of straight up in from the ' 50s to the late60s early '7s then 17 years of sideways consolidation in the 70s to early 80s and uh from 1980 to 2000 again 17 years straight up sideways consolidation from 2000 to 2015 and Now we are uh 2015 to 2025. We're about probably 607 60% of the way through and this cycle would uh end in 2023 uh 2033 2034 2035. Uh this doesn't preclude 20% corrections, but the trend is up and we've talked about the demographic um underpinnings that support that and that continues to be our base case. So, I think we're going to continue to make exceptional amounts of money in a relatively short period of time. And in the early 2030s, we will start to aggressively lighten up, build cash, build shorts, um uh and and and be preparing for one of what will be one of the greatest generational buy opportunities uh in history. But in the meantime, we're halfway up the mountain. Uh there's so much opportunity. It's insane. You know, I was I was nervous this quarter that uh there wasn't going to be enough opportunity because a lot of money came in and I have had zero problems, zero anxiety putting money to to work this quarter. There's like unbelievable opportunities and um I'm just super super excited for our clients and uh and for the back half of the year. So a repetitive 3 to four year cycle driven by central bank liquidity and economic growth. Uh so you can see here same type of thing uh how this is natural. The bias is up. That doesn't preclude 3 to 5 to 10% pullbacks. Uh I don't think we're going to get a 20% again anytime soon. We've had three in the last uh five years. Uh that pulled forward 10.5 years of bare market corrections. Um so all dips are to be bought or sit on your hands and wait through them and don't worry about whether you outperformed or underperformed in the last 5 days or 5 weeks. You think in terms of 3 to 5 years you are going to be crushing it. Okay. And um bullish sentiment again not at extreme kind of mid-range. uh MSCI EF breaking out. That's international. Europe up against this level. Does it go back and retest before breaking out? We don't know. We'll we'll see. Uh doesn't really matter. Here's the 10-year cycle peak. Hit this high high level. 10-year yield. Probably goes back to the top of this line, not below this line. Um 10-year 30-year, which we discussed. Here's the US dollar. It's amazing. Everyone's panicking that the US dollar is going to hell and it's going to go away and everything else. It's still super strong relative to history. It would be natural for it to break this trend line and and go lower and lower over the next few years before resuming its next uptrend. And right now, I think we are in a downtrend. We'll have these counter trend rallies, but the dollar is going to continue to weaken, which helps international, also helps US earnings. The Canadian dollar, everyone was um apoplelectic, scared about the looney. I said, my Canadian friends, uh have no fear. The the strong looney is here. It started to happen. It's early days. So, if you have loonies, I would not be trading them out. I would be hoarding them like nobody's business. you are going to be having massive purchasing power over the next few years. Uh gold that seems to have topped out. We'll see how that plays out. And people say, well, how can you have a view that dollar weakens and gold tops out? And the answer is it's happened many times in history. Zoom out. Uh crude, you know, crude is uh continues to be in a downtrend. Does this stop at the 40s? Does it stop at 66 before going up? The answer is we don't know. I think that um the types of businesses that we're in, the margin of safety is large enough. We've got National Oil Well, Varco, which we love. The balance sheet cash flow less sensitive to price. Comtock Resources has done its back and fill. We were buying some for new clients this week while uh some of you were puking it out. We thank you for your shares. uh and uh will be a seller uh much much higher levels than this and uh not anytime soon. Uh this just shows the industry cycles. Uh and that's that.\n\nmanagement expects pricing and mitigation to largely offset the entire tariff headwind by 2026. Again, most importantly, management expects pricing and mitigation to largely offset the entire tariff headwind by 2026, not 2029, 2026. That sets up Q2 gross margins as an inflection point for the year. Both Q3 and Q4 are expected to show 152 north of 200 basis points of year-over-year margin expansion with Q4 margins landing in the 34 33 to 34% range. That puts Stanley Black & Decker just a hair shy of its long-term target above 35%. A level management expects to reach in the second half of 2026. Not 2036. 2026. Keep in mind, the last time this business had gross margins above 35%, it generated $85 in EPS and traded north of $150 a share. It's in the 60s right now, ladies and gentlemen. And by the way, none of this recovery depends on volume. This is pure cost-driven margin improvement. No market rebound, no operating leverage, just execution. But when the market does turn, and it's inevitable, Stanley Black & Decker will be a cash machine. Tariffs don't change the multi-million dollar using unit housing shortage caused by a decade plus of underbuilding. They don't change demographics with over 70 million millennials entering prime family formation for years. And they don't change this administration's laser focus on cutting red tape and improving housing. Ladies and gentlemen, when rates come down and housing wakes up from the dead, it will suddenly become the new shiny object of the object trade of the market. And this beach ball that has been held underwater will explode higher. We skate to where the puck is going, not to where it's already been. It is only a matter of time.",
    "QUOTES_OF_THE_WEEK": "\n\nhere is this multiclient diversity. \n### QUOTES_OF_THE_WEEK\nSo, so Bitcoin has one asset on it, a Bitcoin, and it has one function, which is to send. And if we're talking, you know, to an investor base about TAM, there's a total addressable market of what I would call gold, which is kind of 22 trillion. Uh, and Ethereum is the next generation of the internet where we can digitize any asset. So you can have literally any asset you can think of, we can create a digit natively digital version of it. And then we can do anything with it. So instead of just send, we can create these arbitrarily complex logic statements called smart contracts, which you can just kind of think of as digital if then else statements that can create infinite applications. So you could create decentralized Airbnb, decentralized Uber, decentralized Amazon, decentralized so anything. And basically what we're attempting to do is creating a price discovery mechanism for the value of intermediation. And and and the first example of this that that's hit product market fit is stable coins. uh and and because Ethereum settles over 85% of all stable coins uh and the there was just the Genius Act that passed two weeks ago which gave clarity to stable coin regulation. the largest beneficiary of the Genius Act is Ethereum and and so and and so basically t\n\nWe're waiting for that return on on investments, but the multiples haven't contracted yet. So, I do think with the weight of the MAG 7 and the S&P 500, you're going to continue to see some international outperformance in the back half of the year. The other thing that we've seen in the last month, month and a half, has been two themes. smaller and high short entrance has uh short interest has outperformed the S&P 500 by 11 full percentage points in the last 67 weeks and I think that's going to continue and the reason is is all dips have to be bought. So many managers sold in the hole over a trillion dollar of equity selling in the beginning part of April and they haven't caught up to their indices. So they've got to chase that performance and they can't chase what's already up a lot. they've got to buy those things that haven't yet moved and those are largely smaller stocks uh which are which are the most shorted right now. And if you look at earnings growth for next year, small cap earnings growth is going to be 37% versus the S&P 500 earnings growth expected to be about 14%. So you basically get more than double the earnings growth for a lower multiple. I think that's where things have to go and things are going to go that direction as rates come down. I think now the writing is on the wall with the jobs report that you referenced. The Fed has to move and the and the Fed odds are up to 87.4% of a cut in September. Look for that pivot at Jackson Hole in August. \n### QUOTES_OF_THE_WEEK\nGreat investment opportunities come around when excellent companies are surrounded by unusual circumstances that cause the stock to be misappraised. That's from Warren Buffett. And that is the core theme. you know, uh, most companies have a vision, mission, you know, DEI statement or some grandiose thing like save the world. This is our mission statement at Great Hill Capital. Great investment opportunities come around when excellent companies are surrounded by unusual circumstances that cause the stock to be misappraised. And what we do for clients every day is find those opportunities and not only take advantage of them, but express them in a unique way where we can get exceptional returns from boring companies with predictability and allocate meaningful amounts of cash because we're not trying to guess the future or gamble on someone coming in to to buy the last tick up when when something's trading at a 100 times sales like we talked about with with David. So, uh so that's that. next Peter Lynch. You get recessions, you have stock market declines. If you don't understand that's going to happen, then you're not ready. You won't do well in the markets. And I think a lot of people uh listen to the podcast over time. And many of them give me money because they've made a lot of money. And the other portion of people that give me money um are those who realize they don't want to do this. Number one, and they can't do that. They don't have the composition uh and the patience and the understanding to sit through that. And that makes perfect sense because I don't do brain surgery. I'm not a lawyer. Uh I'm not a scientist. I'm not a computer scientist. I mean that Ethereum stuff. Woo. You know, I mean, I could spend years studying that and think I had competency and uh I'm sure Andrew would be like, \"Yeah, you still don't know what the hell you're talking about.\" And and and I would accept that. And that's why I allocate to someone who is the best in that space that I can trust, that I know is a winner, that is a winning jockey. And that's why people allocate to Great Hill Capital, and we're very grateful for that. Uh here's some\n\n### QUOTES_OF_THE_WEEK\nWarren Buffett.

Peter Lynch. You get recessions, you have stock market declines. If you don't understand that's going to happen, then you're not ready. You won't do well in the markets.\n### TECHNICAL_CHARTS\nGeneral market, we we can see there momentum a little bit waning here. You've seen this sideways chop. Mortgage rates uh lower than they've been in a while. Semiconductor index up against some little bit of resistance. Probably test back to this level. Uh but here's what's interesting. As the rates have rolled back over, what's happening to the housing index, home builder index is going straight up, which is a core theme that we are playing through Generrack, which is, you know, nearly doubled off its recent lows now in a handful of weeks. QXO has been up quite a bit from our basis. And then, uh, Stanley is starting to recover aggressively. So, we're excited about all that. You know, you just got to deal with the tariff noise on a day-to-day basis while they mitigate it, etc.\n### MACRO_DATA_SLIDES\nLabor market slowed sharply over the past three months. I'm not a huge fan of tariffs, okay? it's going to work out because of the way they've done it. But I don't I wouldn't have gone about it in that specific way. But it is what it is. You you got to play the hand that you're dealt versus being an idealist. It should be this way. It should be that way. I don't care how it should be. I care how it is. And then how am I going to win based on the hand that I'm dealt?",
    "MEDIA_APPEARANCE_RECAP": "\n\n### MEDIA_APPEARANCE_RECAP\nBitcoin has one asset on it, a Bitcoin, and it has one function, which is to send. And if we're talking, you know, to an investor base about TAM, there's a total addressable market of what I would call gold, which is kind of 22 trillion. Uh, and Ethereum is the next generation of the internet where we can digitize any asset. So you can have literally any asset you can think of, we can create a digit natively digital version of it. And then we can do anything with it. So instead of just send, we can create these arbitrarily complex logic statements called smart contracts, which you can just kind of think of as digital if then else statements that can create infinite applications. So you could create decentralized Airbnb, decentralized Uber, decentralized Amazon, decentral so anything. And basically what we're attempting to do is creating a price discovery mechanism for the value of intermediation. And and and the first example of this that that's hit product market fit is stable coins. uh and and because Ethereum settles over 85% of all stable coins uh and the there was just the Genius Act that passed two weeks ago which gave clarity to stable coin regulation. the largest beneficiary of the Genius Act is Ethereum and and and so and and so basically t\n\n### FEATURED_COMPANY_DEEP_DIVES\nwith that said , we would start with ether generating yield accretive acquisitions potentially. And and so what I mean is that is, you know, there are custodians that we could acquire that get paid in Ether for custodying assets uh that we could use. There are staking companies that we could acquire that get paid in Ether for staking. And then as time evolves, uh, we could consider having, uh, other types of M&A that that that wouldn't necessarily be completely ether, uh, denominated, but could, you know, add to the enterprise value as the space matures. And I think that we there's kind of a crawl, walk, run, or a short, medium, long-term, however you want to kind of phrase or cliche of of of what this vehicle can be. And and I think that that'll be up to kind of market dependent and shareholder dependent and and and we're going to, you know, work with our shareholders on kind of the meritocratic best way forward.\n### MEDIA_APPEARANCE_RECAP\nAnd we're back. Uh and then I had the pleasure to join David Lynn. And I love joining David Lynn's show because his audience is so engaged. Uh every single time I've been on the last two, three years, I've been bullish. It tends to be a hard money. gold world is ending uh uh slant of an audience. Uh so they don't love when a bull comes on and and uh I get a kick out of the comments in the show notes when they criticize the hell out of me. And then David is so kind each time to say Tom's been right. Tom's been right. Tom's been right. And um uh we'll hope to keep that streak going. The early part of this is the normal Fed stuff which David likes to talk about which is kind of you know b boring at this point but useful in terms of understanding uh the calculations but the second half turned into something that I did not expect that it was which is where we aggressively dug into the framework and some aspects of my investing framework that maybe I haven't explained in such a clear way in the past. So, I think you're going to find this one valuable. Here we go. If he's right, he still has a leg a high level of disscent that you haven't seen since the early '9s. Two people dissenting him holding rates high. And if he's wrong, he's totally screwed because everyone knew he's too late Powell. The question is, will he or will he stay belligerent Powell and trying to uh kind of get back at the president? Well, you were right last year in calling for a cut before uh inflation reaches 2%. So, we're nowhere close to 2% still. In fact, it's gone up. What's then your outlook for the rest of the year? How many cuts are we getting? Thomas Hayes, managing member of Great Hill Capital, returns once more to the show. We'll be talking about his outlook for stock markets and uh his reaction to the latest uh news regarding um the uh jobs provisions on Friday as well as a new tariffs imposed last week. Welcome back to the show, Thomas. Good to see you. >> Thanks for having me, David. Great to be here. Initially, I wasn't really sure what the markets were reacting to last Friday afternoon. Was it the jobs revisions? Was it tariffs? Was it both? What do you think? I think that uh certainly the jobs look largest overall revision in 50 years. I mean, that's not just a, you know, a government rounding error that that's not even in the same ballpark. So, uh, what that did was it took us from a hawkish setup following the Fed meeting last week when everyone was like you couldn't believe how belligerent Powell was being uh uh regarding rate cuts. when you consider the the level of uh how restrictive he is right now and then you get this jobs report on Friday when it acknowledges oh my goodness the labor market is a lot weaker than anticipated so their dual mandate is back on the table uh which is very constructive and we're seeing already the odds of a September cut have moved up over 90% so that is going to change a lot of things and you started to see it even reflect ed uh yesterday uh with all the indices down except for one. What what was the one? Small caps were up meaningfully yesterday uh which will be a huge beneficiary of rate cuts cuz they've got uh slightly more leverage and and operating leverage in them. And the cuts uh imply we could see a reaceleration now that they they\n\n### MEDIA_APPEARANCE_RECAP\ninitially, I wasn't really sure what the markets were reacting to last Friday afternoon. Was it the jobs revisions? Was it tariffs? Was it both? What do you think? I think that uh certainly the jobs look largest overall revision in 50 years. I mean, that's not just a, you know, a government rounding error that that's not even in the same ballpark.

It's just the flavor of the week is strawberry. It's not rocky road. And I get to buy great businesses at 60 70% off. And turnaround Tom plays the the game where I have my edge, which is called time arbitrage. I'm patient. I don't, you know, if I buy a stock that's down, you know, 60% and it goes down 65%. It like I don't even think about it because how I underwrote it, David, is very simple. If JP Morgan was going to finance me to buy 100% of the business myself with the only caveat is I had to put up 100% of my net worth as the equity. Okay? So, let's say it's a $200 million business and they say, \"We'll give you $170 million of debt, but you have to put $30 million of cash up. And if the business does poorly, we get the business. Your 30 million is wiped out. If the business does well, well, because of the leverage you have on it, that 30 million is going to be worth 300 million. I will do the deal. If I'm not willing to put up a 100% of my net worth to buy the business, why would I even buy one share? And the the difference between my framework and most people is they see Tesla's going up in the news or whatever company is going up in the news and their friend uh you know bought a share and they're it went up and they you know they traded in their Honda for a C series Mercedes and they've got to jump on the thing and then they get holding the bag like 2001 with Amazon because they bought a great business at the wrong price. So we try to buy good businesses at a great price and then we just trade out of them in three, four, five years when they've, you know, usually two to 4x because we bought them at great prices and their cash flows and revenues are very very predictable. And that's where I got the nickname Turnaround Tom. We just rinse and repeat. We buy predictable businesses. We don't have to guess the future. We don't have to play the the Bureau of Labor Statistics game on a month-to-month basis. We don't give a you know what about that stuff. What we care about is is free cash flow going up? If it's not going up, why is it not going up? Is it a temporary impairment? Is it a permanent impairment? How is how is have they handled it through other cycles? Is their moat still durable or is it permanently impaired? And we look at that competitive advantage. And then the final filter is would I put up 100% of my net worth? If I w if I wouldn't put up 100% of my net worth, why would I buy one share for myself or for clients if I'm not willing to take that? So, we underwrite 8 to 10 companies. It's kind of like private equity in the public markets would be the way to think about it. Uh, and we don't worry about the short-term noise on a day-to-day basis. And, uh, it's a very happy, easy way to live. Low leverage. Uh, and we're not white knuckling every earnings report. We could care less. Well, to answer your own question, the rhetorical question as to whether or not or why you would put, you know, why you wouldn't buy a company if you wouldn't uh, you know, put 100% of your own net worth. Well, what if, let's say, I were to say to you, during a bull market, animal spirits are high and so you could maybe put a small percentage of your net worth into basically gambling because that's what everybody else is doing. >> Um, is there some merit to that? >> Yeah. >> So, rule number one, don't lose money. Rule number two, don't forget rule number one. The number one lesson I learned in this business at the first hedge fund I worked with and my boss was a very wealthy and smart guy and he said never let them take you out on a stretcher. And what happens is is it starts like I'll just do a small percentage and it goes up a lot and they don't know why it went up but it went up because you know whatever happens it's a meme stock. It's it's the flavor of the month. You know strawberry is everyone wants strawberry this month. it goes up and they mistake luck for skill. >> So why would you do a 1% bet that turned into 2% when you could do a 30% bet that turns into 60%. So the next time they try 30% and you know what? They're even more brilliant. And it happens again. And 30% goes to 60%, they have no idea why. Why the hell would you bet 30% and double your money when you could bet 100% and double your money? And sure enough, they do it and it goes from 100 to 200. Now they're just a genius. They're already looking at calling a lawyer. How are they going to start their own hedge fund? Because like, you know, working at Walmart, why would I work at Walmart when I could double my money every time I buy a stock? And and then what happens is they say, why would I buy 100% position when I could actually take margin and buy 200% position and double that and it becomes 400 or 300 on my capital. And guess what? this the ambulance comes, they take them out on a stretcher, they lose their dog, they lose their wife, they lose their house. It's like a country song in reverse and uh no one ever hears from them again except 10 years later you see them on the street and they've got a police badge on and it's like, \"Oh, how you been?\" \"I I decided to become a police officer.\" So, you know, you see this stuff over and over. if you've been through enough cycles, it it tastes good until you see the extra pounds on the scale and then before you know it, uh you know, you can't get rid of it. So, uh there have been very few people that play that gambling game that walk away from the casino with chips. Uh but the people who are investing in building the casinos and have a durable business plan, they make money all day long. So, be the casino, not the gambler.\n### MEDIA_APPEARANCE_RECAP\n>> Understood. Where can we learn more from you and um and I guess get your uh Tom specials? >> Yeah.

But we want to make sure if you do have any\n\n### MEDIA_APPEARANCE_RECAP\nActually, hedge funds dumped a trillion dollars of equities in the hole the day before liberation day. Uh, and now they are forced to play catch-up. So, they spent the first half of the 30 something% rally off the lows. Um, you know, praying for a retest. They always look for the retest which never came. Then they had to cover their shorts. So they were the first buyers which exacerbated the rally. Uh and now they're really screwed because uh not only did they sell at the wrong time, but they didn't buy to uh take advantage of the recovery. So they're dramatically they've lost both ways and most of them have material career risk. And people say, well, why does the keep market keep going up and we're trading at 22 times forward earnings? Uh and this is part of the reason. And I don't think that structural bid is going to change uh into year end because there are so many managers that got caught off sides.\n\n### HEADLINES_AND_NEWS\nI would say that on average for the last 100 years, uh, we've had a 20% correction every 3.5 years. We've actually had three of those in the last 5 years, 2020, 2022, and this year, intraday, uh, 20% pullback. So, we've pulled forward uh, 10.5 years of bare market corrections uh, into five. So, what's easy to think is we've we've had nothing but 20% corrections. We're going to get another 20% correction now because the market's overvalued, etc. Um, and I think what's going to surprise people is that we're likely not going to get a 20% correction for longer than you expect. So, the 3 to 5s, yes, the probably 10% scary correction, uh, pullbacks for sure, uh, but they will be bought. And I think the other thing to keep in mind is if you look at MA Magnificent 7 and I know this has been a theme and I know this they've been they were impacted earlier this year and then they bounced off the lows here uh in April with with the catch-up trade is the earnings growth uh as good as earnings have been by the way the earnings were pretty solid for MAG 7 uh is decelerating. So last year was 33%. This quarter was 14% for the Mag 7 that have already reported. We'll get Nvidia in August. But next quarter will be the first quarter that Magnificent 7 earnings growth actually drops below right around 10% maybe a little bit below 10%. That's that's the bad news. The the other bad news is that the multiples have not contracted consistent with the contraction of earnings growth contraction. So uh you've got you know the Microsofts of the world still trading at 33 times PE with 10% earnings growth. You've got the Amazon's trading at 31 times with 8.5% earnings growth. And then you shift over and you look at uh scenarios like uh small caps that are going to have 37% earnings growth in 2026 compared with the S&P 500 at 14 uh 14% earnings growth and yet the multiple for small caps you get more than double the earnings growth for you know meaningfully lower multiple I think that's where the managers are going to be forced to buy. So, you know, put yourself in the position of a hedge fund manager or a long only manager in Boston and, you know, you got nervous. Your clients, you know, told you to sell in in April. We don't know what's going to happen with this crazy crazy leadership or however they phrased it. Uh, and they got it wrong. Uh, and now you've got to catch up to the benchmark, which is now, you know, back to to highs. You can't buy those things that have risen aggressively. So you have to buy those things that have good fundamentals but the price has not yet caught up the the lagards uh that are high quality that are generating free cash less so the the shiny objects although we're still you know we're still seeing that we're still going to see that in pockets.\n\nand sticking with our knitting. Um and I think that people have to get comfortable maybe you're genetically wired to be a growth investor and just do it better than anyone else. You got uh William O'Neal kind of set the framework. Subscribe to Investors Business Daily. Buy the book How to Make Money in Stocks and you can be a growth investor. Uh if you want to, you know, if if you think more business-like about how to why you buy a piece of a business is for uh a piece of the future cash flow, then you know, you're probably genetically wired to be a better value investor than a growth investor. And it doesn't mean you're different. It just means like, you know, one kid, one of my daughters loves chocolate, one loves vanilla. And it's never going to change. That's just how they're wired. So, accept it. And uh and one's not better than the other. It's just a different framework. And if you want to win at one framework, listen to people who are really good at one framework. Don't listen to me about how to buy the next Palunteer. Listen to me about how to buy Generrack when it's down 70% even though it's got 75% of the home standby generator market and it doubles over a few, you know, couple years. \n### MEDIA_APPEARANCE_RECAP\n>> Got it. And I I want to leave plenty of time for you to talk about today's picks, but if anybody's listening to this, I do want to point out, I mean, Tom highlighted some of the names that he's been in even longer than he's talked about them at at money show events. But on my screen here, just year to date, for example, Generrack up about 27%, Boeing up about 26%, Advanced Auto Parts was another name up 15%. Uh, and again, these are names that he's been in for a lot longer. So, understand the profit potential is there if you get the timing and the price right. uh even not just relative to the market but relative to some of these great growth names that get the headlines  but the sort of you know behind the scenes you're making again if you get into these value names at the right point the profits uh can be phenomenal. So it's not just >> by by the way it's not even that it's it's yes buying the stocks down and then waiting you know our average holding period is 12 to 48 months. So you can make quick doubles and triples, you know, quick meaning on average 36 months, which is, you know, an IR that exceeds the S&P 500. But when you buy companies that have such predictable cash flows when the price is down, we do a derivative overlay in a small bucket of the portfolio and that adds such extreme returns without taking meaningful risk to these names because they're so predictable for us. So if the if the stock price goes up, you know, 50% on a small bucket, we can have expected value on different spreads of 5x on that on that boring sleepy name. And um so it's it's kind of like a um it's nuanced because it's not just these slow doubles and triples. It's how we're able to express it for clients that makes boring stocks with predictable and sleep well at night incredible returns over time. >> Got it. Well, let's talk about one of the names that I know you've mentioned before, but I mean you're still a fan of it. It's something that that I think is appropriate for this audience that is talking here, and that's Cooper Standard. You know, auto part supplier, correct? Uh what's the story there? Why has it worked so far? And why do you think there's more, you know, more to come in a name like that? >> Yeah, Cooper Standard. So, they reported on Friday. They took up their guidance. They took down the industry estimates of annual production. So, they're very levered. Uh we got this idea from Charlie Munger did a similar turnaround situation uh in the recession of 2001 to 2003. Company named Tenico. Uh they were an auto parts supplier. Maybe you remember them. Uh they were down you know 90s something% they had $1.1 billion of debt. They had to refinance it. People thought they were going out of business. Buffett bought it at a buck and change. Uh they refinanced the debt. He got out a year, year and a half later at 15 bucks. It subsequently went on to 35 bucks, you know, but uh error of omission, no big deal. And uh so we looked at this COVID situation. We're like, what's the most dislocated businesses that we could maybe replicate? And we started looking in the auto parts suppliers and we found a company called Cooper Standard. This was May of 2022. And Cooper Standard, same story. They had a billion dollars. They had to refinance. They have refinanced a lot of that out to nothing to deal with until 2027 and then later in the decade. So, uh, we built a position in May 2022 in the fives. Okay, $5 and change. I think today it's, you know, 20, $25, something like that. So, 5x on the bulk of it. We've added clients in at 10. We've added clients in at 13, 14, $15, etc. as they've come in later and later. This is a simple play. This is a business with huge operating leverage. They're uh they do ceiling systems around the doors and windows, that rubber stuff that goes around uh fluid transfer systems. Very boring. And it's a leverage play on the recovery of US SAR sell through the number of units sold. Okay. And if you go back 50 years, despite the fact that the population was a lot less uh 50 years ago, maybe 220 million versus 330 million, uh every single cycle peak came in between 17.1 million cars and 18.5 million cars going all the way back to 1980. uh we got down to 15.1 million cars at the trough of uh COVID. Okay. And we're still not yet at we're in in like the mid5s to high 15s. And part of that's been high rates. Uh uh part of it is cars last longer. Part of it is the demography. But all of those things are coming back together. Okay. Number one, we got uh a 90.4% 4% chance of a cut in September as of this morning. Rates are coming down. The car volumes are starting to come back. The average car on the road is 13.5 years. And this was a $146 stock at the last cycle peak uh when SAR was over 17 million in 2017. They earned $7.19 in 2017 and the stock traded at 146. We bought it at 5. They refinanced the debt. It quickly doubled. Uh the volumes have not yet recovered. We believe based on the amount of costs that they've taken out of the business, hundreds of millions of dollars of costs, that when the the cycle volumes, they don't even have to go back to 17 million, which they will, by the way. Most people don't think they will. Even at 16.5 to 17 million, this business is not going to earn $7 a share because they've become so much more efficient. We think it can earn $10 a share. So if it traded at $146 at $7.19 of earnings, call it 20 times earnings. Um at $10 earnings, the question is what multiple does the market apply when we hit the next cycle peak? Does it apply 10 times? Then you got a $100 stock in which case it would be 20 20 bagger off of our initial basis. Uh 10 bagger off of some of the the later people that came in. Uh if you get a 20 times multiple again, a peak multiple, you could have a $200 stock. Is that our base case? No. But would it surprise us if we wind out wind up with a blended 20x 15 20x 25x on it? No. And this is something that's very easy. We don't have to predict is someone willing to pay 150 time sales versus 125 times sales and just gamble there will be people coming in buying us. I mean, it's a very simple formula. At 10 times earnings, it's not going to be hard to attract a lot of buyers. At 15 times earnings, if they're generating 10 bucks, it it's not unrealistic to think it could trade to 150 to 200. And if you and if you're skeptical, cut it in half. You still have a triple from these levels. Uh, which, you know, over a three four year period is a pretty attractive scenario. So nothing is perfectly without risk, but we try to minimize risk and cover. You know, I was taught number one, never let them take you out on a stretcher. That was my first boss. Okay. So, uh, and and number two, if you protect the downside, the upside take takes care of itself. And that's what we try to do every day is sleep every night, underwrite it as if you're buying the whole company. And if you're not willing to buy the whole company with 100% of your net worth as the equity, don't buy one share. You don't have to be involved in everything. You can actually read\n\nquestions , now's the time to type them in, get a chance to get a few of those answered before we're done. I actually saw one question come through. And that's, uh, uh, Tom, this one says, \"S&P is up about 7 and a half% year to date. Where do and I don't know if you want to sort of take a macro opinion. Where do you see it going for the remainder of the year?\" And the second part of the question was, do you actually have a price target for a name like Gener Stanley Works? SWK. >> Yeah. So, so Stanley, so Generrack, Stanley Black & Decker and QXO, which is Brad Jacobs roll up of uh building supply is is our theme for our housing recovery play and that's going to be a function of rates coming down uh over the next 6 to 12 months. Um, so in in terms of our price targets, uh, we don't publicly say them, but I would say uh, for Stanley Black & Decker, uh, it's at least double from here. Generex got more gas in the tank. Uh, for sure, mid200s, uh, will probably be fully out, mid to high 200s. Um, and we'll trim some along the way, etc. QXO is just getting started. That's going to be an 8 to10 year roll up play that probably goes to $80 to $100 plus with Brad Jacobs. That guy knows how to compound capital. We got in at 12 $12 and change. It quickly went on the beacon. It doubled to 25. Now I think it's at 20. Uh so that could be a four bagger over the next 6 to 8 years from these levels. Maybe five bagger. And he tends to underpromise and overd deliver. So he'll probably have some rabbits he pulls out of the hat. He's an awesome. So, so we look for these themes and and what you can see from uh from the themes is we buy when they're out of favor, when they're not in the headlines , when people aren't talking about them, and we sell when they start to be in the news every day and become the new shiny objects of tomorrow and people can't get enough, we help them out and lay off the shares. As far as the S&P 500, look, we're in a seasonally weak part. It wouldn't surprise me to see 3 to 5% pullbacks consolidate some of the gains. uh but I think we resolve higher into year end. So, uh, it wouldn't surprise me to see us, you know, if we go back to 62, 6,100, uh, that we don't finish the year at, you know, 6600, 60,6650, 6700 type type of thing because, uh, you still have 14% earnings growth next year. You still have a lot of opportunity on the surface. I do think if you're exclusively in indices or the companies that have already moved a lot or that everyone's crowded into, I think you're going to underperform. This goes back to the conversation. It's not an eitheror, it's a both end. They mag 7 can go up from here. I think they will go up less on a relative basis than those lagards that people have to chase to catch their benchmarks and keep their jobs uh and those stocks that uh haven't moved as much that are going to be the the leaders for the second half of 2025. So so that's how I would think about it. Um, so it doesn't mean you you have to get out of one set of companies just because the others. It just means you might lighten up a little bit one group and start to add some of the other group that you you're underexposed. Got it. A question for on just came in actually. It says, \"Do you think if oil drops to say $50, then do you think the tech technicals will push the riskless or fundamental price much lower than 13?\" >> I could care less. We'll be buyers. I hope I hope oil falls to 40 and we can buy a ton of stock at $8. Uh because if I look three to five years out, I've got, you know, 40 $50 stock. So, if I get to buy more at eight, I'd be super happy about that. I don't I don't think about or even worry about the the short-term voting machine based on emotions or $50 oil. Uh I think that benefits National Oil Wellvarco as a leader in what they do. It would hurt its competitors more than it would hurt it because it's got the strongest balance sheet. It's got the greatest expertise. It's got the highest install base. Uh and and their business profitability is less dependent on the price of oil because of the existing stall install base and the servicing. So it's not without risk to the price of oil, but it's lower risk, which is why we chose to express our interest in out of favor energy through uh through this particular company because of uh accounting for the possibility of lower oil prices in the short term. >> Got it. Well, I think that's the last question that I saw come in and my my watch is about to say we're kind of at the the end of our time here, but Tom, thank you so much honestly for joining in this discussion. viewers, if if you're listening to this again, check out hedge fund tips. Check out some of the work Tom does. Uh you'll see him on TV as well, talking about, you know, some of just a different way of thinking about investing. Uh really thinking about the types of investors that have won long term that have those track records. It's in the value space and he's got the numbers to prove it. So Tom, thank you so much for sharing your insights and your picks and look forward to talking again in the future. >> Appreciate it. Thanks so much, Mike. >> Take care. And we're back. ### MEDIA_APPEARANCE_RECAP\nUh, and then I had the pleasure of joining Liz on CNA Asia, which is like the BBC of Asia. Huge channel. Thanks to Marian Star In also thanks obviously to David Lynn and thanks uh especially to Andrew Keys for joining us on that uh great explanation of Ethereum. Uh, and this was general market. >> Thomas Hayes uh, chairman and managing member Greatill Capital joins us for more now. Thomas, thanks for your time this morning. So, markets have been pretty much on a choppy ride. Uh, and this latest pullback has been attributed to the weaken than expected uh services data as well as new tariff comments from the president on the farmer and uh the semicon sectors. I mean, how would you characterize the current state of the market? >> Well, we've had an enormous move off the lows, Liz, some 30%. So, we're consolidating gains and we're moving into a seasonably weak part of the year. Usually, August, September, and early October have a little bit of volatility. So, it's natural to have some consolidation. However, I wouldn't get too bearish because you have too many managers that are behind the benchmark and every dip of 3 to 5% will be bought. The question is is where are they going to put that money? And are they going to put that money in uh Magnificent 7 which has already moved a lot and has shown while they had good earnings that their earnings growth is decelerating. As a matter of fact, Q3 will be the first quarter that Magnificent 7 earnings are 10% or below 10%. That's down from 33% last year. Or like you saw today, the only index that was up was the small cap index. Are managers going to buy the lagards, the the small caps and the most shorted stocks, which has have actually outperformed the indices? The most shorted stocks have outperformed the indices by 11% in the last 6 to 7 weeks. So, I think what you're going to see is volatility, short-term consolidation at the index level, which is predominantly magnificent 7, and real opportunity and real buying starting to happen under the surface for the unmagnificent 493. the remainder of the S&P 500 and small caps. And now that you saw the odds of a cut in September going over 90% today after the largest revision in jobs data in 50 years that we saw on Friday. I think it uh points to things to be constructive moving forward uh as you look out 3 to 6 months even if you get a little chop in the next 3 to 6 weeks. >> Right. Gotcha. So I just want to take a look at some of the uh reasons for this uh dip in market moves overnight and one of that was the ISM services data which showed uh weakening activity but persistent price pressures. I mean with services sector representing quite a significant part of the US economy in fact 70%. I mean how are you viewing this stagnation especially as also we're seeing uh the data showing slowing jobs growth. Yeah, there's no question the Fed needs to cut or they're going to be it is going to be a question of too late Powell. But what you've seen for the last couple of years is you had this huge pull forward of goods during COVID and then everyone got loaded up with goods and we went to uh aggressive service spending while good spending fell and now you're seeing a a resumption of goods overtaking services. So yes, t\n\nMagnificent 7 which has already moved a lot and has shown while they had good earnings that their earnings growth is decelerating. As a matter of fact, Q3 will be the first quarter that Magnificent 7 earnings are 10% or below 10%. That's down from 33% last year.

But what you've seen for the last couple of years is you had this huge pull forward of goods during COVID and then everyone got loaded up with goods and we went to uh aggressive service spending while good spending fell and now you're seeing a a resumption of goods overtaking services. So yes, t### MEDIA_APPEARANCE_RECAP\nhere is  a bit of softness in in the the services data, but goods and consumer discretionary are starting to pick up. As a matter of fact, earnings growth estimates coming into this quarter in the United States for the S&P 500 were just 4.8%. Well, with 2thirds of the S&P having reported, we're over 10% earnings growth and earnings estimates for the year have actually gone up not only for 2025 in the last few weeks, but also for 2026. Uh, expecting S&P 500 to come in at about $31 of earnings per share. So, on balance, it's it's mixed. Softening employment is clear. uh Fed Powell is too restrictive, but uh with the resignation of Cougler and uh Powell uh term running out May of next year, you're going to basically have four of the uh seven governors uh moving in the direction of more dovish policy and the market starting to sniff that out. and you add a little dovish policy, you bring borrowing rates down and this business, this uh economy is going to fly because uh consumers balance sheets are very underlevered. They have trillions in home equity that can be drawn once rates come down. We can relever the private sector. The public se sector obviously is overlevered. We need to to handle that and Trump is trying to do that partially with tariffs, partially with growth. uh but the public sector has really a lot of room to move once rates start to come down. So I think you're going to see a snap back after some short-term uh consolidation for sure. >> Right. But something that could throw a spanner in the works um appears to be or possibly could be um the imminent tariffs on semiconductors and pharmaceuticals especially for pharmaceuticals. I mean, the president's talked about, you know, the taxes on that going up to possibly 250%. And and so, how much of an impact do you think that could pose to inflation? Um, and also what does this mean for markets, especially um in the sectors of tech and healthcare? I mean, should these uh measures be enacted, which the president said could come in a week or so? >> Yeah, this is the way President Trump negotiates. in case you haven't gotten the memo. What he does is he punches people in the face and then he offers them an ice pack and they're happy for the ice pack. So he goes in for the big ask. This is a huge ask. He's doing the same thing with India. He's doing the same thing with Canada. And if they don't cooperate and they don't come to the table to negotiate, you know what? They get hit again in the face until they\n\n### MEDIA_APPEARANCE_RECAP\nPresident Trump wants the economy to do exceptionally well. He wants the stock market to do exceptionally well.

And he comes to a more rational decision. uh and uh puts a floor under it and we move ahead and the economy continues to grow. So this time will be no different. So if you got to take a couple bumps along the way in the next 24 48 hours, so be it. But looking out 369 months, uh companies are optimistic. Companies are investing.

This is a true up uh it's interesting the board said that we needed to give him this grant to keep him focused on Tesla. I mean he's got 13% of a trillion dollar company. That's 130 billion round numbers close to half of his net worth. I don't know that he needs that to keep him focused on Tesla, but maybe they need to keep him in the picture. Uh, and that's exactly what they're doing here. I mean, with the EV tax credits going away, you're seeing the big three pivot away from EVs towards hybrids and ex uh Chinese EV companies. I think Tesla is going to be the the last man standing. Uh, and they do need Elon Musk and they do need to pivot the company towards humanoid robots and towards robo taxis for it to continue to grow into its current valuation cuz uh the EV numbers haven't been great and they're not going to get much better. >> Thomas, what bothers me about this is um so Elon may stay until 2027. Dan Ives thinking 2030 yet we still have no clear plan on succession. Am I wrong to care about that or does it even matter? Is Elon Musk still driving the story? No pun intended. >> I think it's another equity grant in 2027 or 2020 2030. Look, Tesla is Elon Musk. Elon Musk is Tesla. You take him out of the picture, all that premium goes away.

Earnings growth was about 14% for MAG7 that has reported but that's down from 33% earnings growth last year and next quarter will be the first quarter that earnings growth for MAG 7 actually goes below 10% but the multiples haven't contracted so if you look at Amazon 31 times PE with low double digits earnings growth you look at Microsoft 30 31% 31 times PE with 8% earnings growth so you're seeing the earnings growth compress as they spend more and more on capex.

Here's um I I I want to get your reaction first and then um I want to show you uh Ray Dio's reaction on Twitter. He claims that uh he would have fired her too, but not for the same reasons. But um what is your general assessment of whether or not BLS data is useful as an investor or investment and or trading indicator? Yeah, I would say two two things. One, biggest revision, uh, two-month revision since 2013, multimonth revisions going back 50 years. So whether there was a political motivation or not a political motivation, I have no idea. That's speculation. But, uh, you know, if you're building a house and, you know, you're you're 4T off from where the the baseboard should go, uh, you've got a structural problem for years. So, she's just simply incompetent. she wasn't bringing in the right technology or the right people to uh narrow that margin of safety to get accurate data. So just simple incompetence was a uh good enough reason to fire her and and move on and get someone credibility credible in there that's going to take action to reform and update and upgrade uh the data collection and dissemination. So I I I think that's number one. The second part of your question, >> let's take a look at what uh Dallio said here. Uh I probably would have fired the head of the BLS2.

That's because this process for making estimates is obviously error uh uh errorprone and obsolete. T\n### MISCELLANEOUS\nno good plan in the works for fixing it. Well, if it's errorprone and obsolete, why are we using it as any sort of trading indicator at all? >> Well, one uh I don't use it I I I think this is in the in the scheme of short-term voting machine, long-term weighing machine. like these revisions eventually get it right. So if you're using it on a trading on a month-to-month or week- toeek basis, which we don't do, uh then yes, this data is really not helpful and potentially harmful to to your outlook. If you're an investor and you're looking at the free cash flow of a company and the revenue growth and the moat, uh it's completely meaningless because you will have after a few months the the correct numbers. Uh I think what Dallio is saying based on that article that you just posted is exactly what I'm saying. Something is is wrong regardless of the motivation you need someone to upgrade the systems and improve the data collection and dissemination. Uh and if there was any uh issue political bias etc that's another reason but that can't be proven at the moment and it's irrelevant. The key is the output is insufficient and not acceptable. >> Well, the bigger picture then on the jobs numbers, do um do the job numbers indicate any significant meaningful slowdown in uh employment activity thereby potentially lowering uh margins and weakening earnings for this quarter or next. Yeah, look, I think you know if you look at the revisions going back multi-months that was a period of significant uncertainty. So it might be the lagged effect cuz what you've seen since then is seuite confidence after liberation day was kind of resolved the market started to recover. uh you're seeing CEO confidence come back. As a matter of fact, last week was the biggest week in years for deal activity, M&A, uh etc. That the the uh investment bankers in the Hamptons aren't playing golf. They're busy on the phones in August, which is pretty unusual. So, animal spirits have come back. Uh, and I think that um it might be more of a rear view looking mirror phenomenon, but it's also a message to the Fed like, hey, you really are too restrictive and you really are too late because once the unemployment starts to tick up, it's very very hard to put that genie back in the bottle. Uh, inflation on the other hand, you can quell pretty quickly. So in other words, when you think about riskreward in terms of a dual mandate, let's assume this trend persists and the weakening job market uh persists and it wasn't solely attributable to liberation day and the uncertainty around liberation day, well then you're probably already too late with cuts. Uh however, if it is a short-term phenomenon and let's say you cut too early and all of a sudden employment starts roaring back with with CEO confidence and seauite confidence and inflation ticks up because uh you cut too quickly. Well, it's very easy to quell inflation. You could you could simply do a a hike of 25 or 50 basis points and put inflation back in the jar. You can't do a cut, you know, 25 basis point cut and put unemployment uh uh back in the jar. It just continues to persist and fear builds upon fear builds upon fear. And then you wind up having to go with, you know, if it's a serious recession, a half a trillion dollar, multiundred billion dollar stimulus to get the economy back on track and that worsens the deficit. So, uh, t\n\nUm, so if there's no downside to cut too soon, hypothetically, uh, and there's massive downside to stay restrictive and be too late Powell, well, you you have to take that into account. And now where you have the one governor resigning, you have dissent on the Fed. Uh for a guy that's so concerned about his legacy, uh now he's kind of boxed because if he's if he's right, he still has a legacenting him holding rates high. Um, and if he's wrong, he's totally screwed because everyone knew he's too late. Powell. So, uh, he's he's in a box now. He's got his out with this latest jobs report and he can use this to save face and pivot at Jackson Hole. The question is, will he or will he stay belligerent Powell and trying to uh kind of get back at the president? But that that doesn't help the world. It doesn't help the country and it certainly doesn't help those people uh that are in the labor market for sure. \n### MISCELLANEOUS\n>> I think we've got to go at least two. And I think that's all we're going to get. Uh we should probably do 75 to 100 basis points. That's kind of neutral. And that gives you enough cushion in case uh Powell's prophecy of uh inflation being more than a a one-off uh uh comes out to be true. Uh I I I think that's the right level. You know, if you look at housing being 16% of GDP, uh he's really put that in a box and that's that's hurting a tremendous amount of the population. You know, our largest portion of the population is the millennials and the uh average age of home buying has gone from first-time home buying has gone from 28 to now 38. That's put their whole lives on hold. That's that's um kind of um reduced the incentive to have children. If you can't afford a house, why are you going to have kids? And a lot of that generation because of Powell have now resigned themselves to not having children, not having the joy of family formation, not having the joy of a starter home, not having an ownership stake. So there are a lot of unintended consequences created by a guy who's interested in how he's written and not being Arthur Burns, which the current economic state has no resemblance to the conditions that Arthur Burns faced in the 70s, demographically, economically, or otherwise. It's a shame. Uh, you know, if you had said to me, David, uh, you know, six years ago, would you rather have a successful business person running the Fed or an academic? I would have said, business person, hands down. Uh, I I I was wrong. Uh, I give me the PhDs out the wazoo that actually understand the e uh uh economy or at least understand how to manage a central bank. I I think Powell would have been an incredible Treasury Secretary. I think he's a generally good, competent person. I don't think he has the skill set for the job. >> Uh, moving on from the Fed, do you think markets generally speaking are more recepted to Fed policy now or fiscal policy and especially trade certainty? In other words, what are the biggest triggers going forward for the rest of the year? >> I think the tariff policy is a headwind. I think the one big beautiful bill is a tailwind that's not yet priced in. So the shortterm negative effects of the tariff policy are being offset by the one big beautiful bill which is not fully priced in. So I think it's a it's a net positive allin uh and therefore I do think the economy reacelerates and what we found also you know going up 50% on India and and far 250% on pharmaceuticals and all this other stuff. What we know about this administration is they will bend things but not break them. They will bend them as far as they can get. But if if the bond market and the stock market starts to look uh like it's breaking like we saw in early April, they quickly uh show flexibility and rationality and they reverse those positions. So they want to get as much as they can without breaking things. And I think the intent of the administration and and rightfully so is for the economy to do as well as possible. And candidly, uh, President Trump does measure his success by what the Dow does. And, uh, he's not going to let it go to that far down because it's not helpful to people's retirements. It's not helpful to confidence. It's not helpful to animal spirits. And he wants to see it grow. And what we're seeing with real wages now coming back to levels not seen since his first term is Main Street is doing tremendously better than they did uh, prior to him coming in in the last four years. as Main Street real wages are reacelerating again and people on Main Street are doing better. >> Your overall thesis for the rest of the year in notes that you sent me, you reiterated your uh long stance and you wrote that um dips are to be bought. Sit on your hands and do nothing. You said uh elaborate. So >> yeah, we're look we're in the seasonally weak part of the year. August, September, October, everyone knows. So everyone's looking for a big correction. And I think what they're going to be disappointed with certainly those looking for big corrections 10 or 20% are going to be sorely disappointed because uh on average you get a 20% bare market correction every 3.5 years. We've had three in the last 5 years. So we've pulled forward 10.5 years of bare market corrections. uh uh I do think that uh you know 3 to 5 to 8% corrections are possible after a 30 something% move off the off the lows but what you have to keep in mind is uh there was record selling in the whole a trillion dollars of equities were sold the day before liberation day predominantly hedge funds institutional managers you know who got it right was the retail investors and they've gotten it right every single dip since co they've been buyers not sellers institutions and hedge funds have been wrong and now they're all dramatically behind their benchmark. So they can't buy the things that are already up. Uh they have to buy the lagards in an effort and they got to do it with leverage in an effort to catch up to their benchmark and keep their jobs. Which is why you have seen in the last 7 8 weeks one of the biggest pockets of outperformance 11% more than the S&P 500 has been the most shorted stocks. the most hated stocks, those lagards that um have been the last to move have now started to outperform and I think that's going to be the theme. So if we see some volatility in in the indices basically now if you talk about the S&P 500 you're just talking about MAG 7 and what did we see with MAG7 earnings the six or so that have reported is they were good okay but they're decelerating so last year 33% this quarter 14% earnings growth uh by Q3 next quarter what no one's really talking about it's going to be the first time that they're that earnings growth of the MAG 7 is 10% or slightly below 10% earnings growth. So why does that matter? It matters because the multiples relative to the earnings growth have not come down. If you look at the Microsoft's uh 10 10% earnings growth, 33 times multiple, the uh Amazon's 31 times multiple 8 12%. Are they great businesses? You bet. Are you paying up a little more than you should based on the earnings growth and certainly in a decelerating earnings growth environment? Yes. Contrast that with something like the small cap indices which will dramatically benefit from the uh reinitiation of Fed cuts more than anyone else because they've got the most leverage. And if you look at earnings growth for 2026, uh small Russell 2000 expected earnings growth is 37%. that's excluding the benefit in terms of their debt servicing when rates start to come down 50 75 basis points versus the S&P 500 at 14% earnings growth. Uh and furthermore, you're getting a much lower multiple still on small caps with more than double the earnings growth than you are on the S&P 500. So managers will have no choice but to start to buy those, start to buy the unmagnificent 493. So, if you're saying, \"Oh, do I buy the S&P 500 index right now?\" Which is basically saying, \"Oh, do I buy MAG 7 right now?\" I think you're going to be disappointed. You're probably going to be net up. So, if we get, you know, three, five, eight, 7, 8% uh volatility in the next few months. Maybe you do, maybe you don't. I think there are so many people off sides. I think the surprise would be that we actually push higher and don't get any material correction which would be the maximum pain trade right now because people are not positioned for that. More people are lightening up or behind the benchmark than are overweight and giddy right now. If you look at all the sentiment indicators, some are a little bit elevated, but they're not really giddy, which which kind of implies to me the the pain trade going into the fall with everyone looking at seasonal weaknesses, maybe we get more strength than expected, but certainly in the places that no one's focused on would be my bet. >> I wonder if they're more expensive because they're the best inclass businesses. And so if you're paying a bit of a premium on on valuations, it's because you're buying better businesses which would in theory outperform\nthe last any any period longer small cap value is the highest performer. So you know and that goes for value generally speaking. the the data got skewed in a in a period of 15 years of ZERP. So unless you're betting on ZERP coming back, uh that's probably not your highest and best use. And if you go back a h 100red years uh and you think about do I allocate you know 100% of my money to value or 100% of my money to growth. Well, if you put a million dollar in value versus growth uh in 1928 uh value you would have $68 million more dollars today because it outperforms on average about 4% not in aggregate 4% per year compounded over a hundred years. uh where people are sideways is like they were in the late 90s which is that growth has outperformed the last you know 10 years in this case therefore it's going to outperform forever uh and I think what people miss is a a great example is Amazon when you look at the palunteers and different great companies of the world Amazon was one of the greatest companies in 1999 and 2000 and we were all betting that what they said was going to happen in the future would happen in the future, which would be it would be the store of everything. They would deliver everything to your house. It would all be online, etc. And guess what? They did everything they said they were going to do over the next 15 years. The problem is uh in 1999 and 2000, you were paying for them already having delivered that 15 years of value at that time, 15 years early. So what happened over the next three years? Amazon stock was down 90% from 2000 to 2002 2003 and it wasn't down 90% from 2002 to 2002 2003 because we were in a recession okay because the fundamentals of Amazon's business in each of those years 2000 2001 2002 2003 continued to improve revenues continued to improve cash flow continued to improve earnings continue to improve the price of the stock went down 90%. Why would that happen? It happened because Amazon was a great company. Amazon is a great company. The problem was the short-term voting machine, the emotional voting machine was 15 years too early. You were paying for 15 years of performance uh 15 years too early. And therefore, the stock price had to correct to where the fundamentals actually were, not to where they would be. And then by the time as we got closer to 15 years out and all the things they said they were going to do in 2000 were actually happening, the price caught back up. And I think we're seeing that with a number of these super high-flying stocks right now that are doing unbelievable things and will be doing even better things 5 10 15 years out. The question is are you already paying for it? And will you have a reckoning in the intermediate term when the market says, \"Yeah, they're great.\" But you've already paid for the next 20 years of seamless perfect execution. So if they if they come in 1% lower than the perfect execution, you're not going to get a 1% pullback. You're going to get an 80% pullback. And those are the type of stocks we want to avoid. And what we want to do is look for our turnaround time specials that are durable, predictable businesses that have been generating cash for, you know, decades and have predictable trend lines of cash flow and uh and uh uh revenues that have a temporary dislocation because they're out of favor due to rates or due to sector dislocation. Where the short-term voting machine price is not pricing in 15 years of greatness. it's pricing in that they're going out of business and there's no way in hell they're going out of business. So therefore, when people when the mood shifts and the flavor of the month, the stock market, you know, it's like the stock market's like BaskinRobins. What's the flavor of the month? Right now, it's not those great companies that uh when that comes back into vogue and Rocky Road is back in flavor. You get doubles and triples in 24, 36 months. And that's what we like to do. Rinse and repeat over and over. Boring, durable businesses that furthermore, we can allocate massive amounts of capital. We can take 10% positions. You can't take a 10% position with a company that's trading at 100 times sales unless you're a cowboy and you're reckless because at some point maybe it'll double again. But you're gambling. You know, you have no downside protection because when it when the music stops on those names, it's not a a 3% pullback. It's a everyone rushes to the exit at the same time because there's no fundamental underpinning for the current price even if the businesses are fantastic. \n### MISCELLANEOUS\n>> Are there in the universe of Tom special stocks? Are there any uh sectors or subsectors within the AI infrastructure trade that would fit the criteria of not being super overvalued right now? In other words, AI infrastructure, how would you play that besides just buying those AI stocks outright? Yeah, I mean look, that's not a core theme for us because we think the actual key beneficiaries are going to be the >> companies that implement the AI which are not yet priced in the efficiencies and the margin improvement and the productivity and the margin expansion that's going to come to regular everyday business is not yet reflected. So if we're buying great businesses, they're going to become greater business with with the advent of AI. But in terms of like simple exposure to the theme, we like energy. Okay. So one of the names that we have around 78 bucks is Comtock Resources. Uh Jerry Jones owns the majority of the stock, 70 plus% of the stock. We're co-investors with him. Somewhere around $8 a share. It went up to $30 a share. It's now at $17. We're in the market buying more. it's going to 50 over the next two to three years. So, that's a no-brainer for us, continual uh demand for energy. Uh the other backdrop you need with all the data centers is generators. So, GenerRack has been a huge hit for us. Um uh started buying that thing below 100, shot up to 190, corrected, now it's back uh knocking on the door of 200. That probably goes to 250, 300 plus. Uh that's another energy play. I think the dark horse in all of this, I know there's a lot of noise around Intel and everyone's saying it's a, you know, baggy, you know what, but the fact of the matter is, you heard it from Trump yesterday, they've got to produce chips in the in the US and they're the only game in town. Yes, Taiwan Semiconductor has fabs and they can invest in that, but they want to invest in Intel. Intel and Lip Bhutan, that's going to be the dark horse surprise in the next 48 months. You can't give the stock away right now. If they liquidated it tomorrow, you get a 100% of your money back. Uh, and if on their legacy business, it's worth 40 45 $50. And if they actually get their production in gear, which now they've got a partner in the government going to have to backstock stop them. And Lit Bhutan, who at Cadence Designs had like a 50 plus bagger. This guy knows how to do turnarounds. He knows everyone in the industry. He's going to get it right. You wind up with a $100 stock. And that's something that I can sleep like a baby at night because I know what my downside is and my upside's unlimited. If they get half of their projections right versus buying something that's already priced for absolute perfection and then, you know, if they if they miss by 1%, the stock's down 50%. So, I'd rather buy it when it's already down that much and then get my doubles and triples versus holding on with white knuckles and praying to God that the next earnings call they don't, you know, wrinkle their nose the wrong way and everyone runs for the exits. \n### HEADLINES_AND_NEWS\n>> Here's another piece of news that I'd like you to comment on. So, the Trump brothers, uh, Donald Trump's sons are now, uh, backing manufacturing spack, filing for $300 million US IPO. Uh, it's going to be called New America Acquisition uh, Corp. Uh, New America said in the filing that it aims to buy businesses with a combined enterprise value of 700 million or more and will target companies that play a meaningful role in revitalizing domestic manufacturing, expanding innovation ecosystems and strengthening critical supply chains. Is that are those themes that you're so interested in as a manager? >> Yes. Yeah. I think I think the reshoring is going to be a key theme. I look I think they're playing a lot of the thematic plays. They're obviously heavy in crypto. I was at the New York Stock Exchange. They were um promoting some gun company. So, you know, they're they've got their hands in a lot of pots. But I do think that theme of uh manufacturing resurgence in the US is a durable theme. And some of these technologies, whether it's AI, robotics, whether it's uh uh are going to help accelerate that because what what largely makes the US uncompetitive is regulations and labor costs. So Trump is going to gut the regulations and some of these technologies uh brought to you by robotics brought to you by AI. I mean we're seeing it in one holding we have GXO Logistics which uh which Brad Jacobs uh was one of Brad Jacobs spin-offs one of the greatest wealth creators for stockholders in history whether it was Waste Connections, United Rentals, XPO, now he's got QXO and he has GXO. uh they're one of the biggest utilizers of these humanoid type of robots in their warehouses. Not not the Tesla ones, but other companies make great robots. Uh and they will continue to benefit and that's a huge scaled business with one of the largest logistics providers in the world and uh warehousing and uh um uh etc. Shipping return they they handle returns for major companies. So uh I think you're going to see more and more of that and as the GXOs of the world can implement more of this automation their margins are going to go up and up and up which is going to uh giving give them price uh competition and scale where they can just squeeze out all the competitors over time. So I want to be in those forwardinking companies that are actually utilizing the technology versus the ones that are creating it and trying to guess who's the winner. I I'd rather bet on sure durable businesses that have a free option of massive margin expansion by utilizing the technologies versus gambling on who's going to get the technology right. >> Okay. And then\n\n### MEDIA_APPEARANCE_RECAP\nActually, hedge funds dumped a trillion dollars of equities in the hole the day before liberation day. Uh, and now they are forced to play catch-up. So, they spent the first half of the 30 something% rally off the lows. Um, you know, praying for a retest. They always look for the retest which never came. Then they had to cover their shorts. So they were the first buyers which exacerbated the rally. Uh and now they're really screwed because uh not only did they sell at the wrong time, but they didn't buy to uh take advantage of the recovery. So they're dramatically they've lost both ways and most of them have material career risk. And people say, well, why does the keep market keep going up and we're trading at 22 times forward earnings? Uh and this is part of the reason. And I don't think that structural bid is going to change uh into year end because there are so many managers that got caught off sides.\n\n### HEADLINES_AND_NEWS\nI would say that on average for the last 100 years, uh, we've had a 20% correction every 3.5 years. We've actually had three of those in the last 5 years, 2020, 2022, and this year, intraday, uh, 20% pullback. So, we've pulled forward uh, 10.5 years of bare market corrections uh, into five. So, what's easy to think is we've we've had nothing but 20% corrections. We're going to get another 20% correction now because the market's overvalued, etc. Um, and I think what's going to surprise people is that we're likely not going to get a 20% correction for longer than you expect. So, the 3 to 5s, yes, the probably 10% scary correction, uh, pullbacks for sure, uh, but they will be bought. And I think the other thing to keep in mind is if you look at MA Magnificent 7 and I know this has been a theme and I know this they've been they were impacted earlier this year and then they bounced off the lows here uh in April with with the catch-up trade is the earnings growth uh as good as earnings have been by the way the earnings were pretty solid for MAG 7 uh is decelerating. So last year was 33%. This quarter was 14% for the Mag 7 that have already reported. We'll get Nvidia in August. But next quarter will be the first quarter that Magnificent 7 earnings growth actually drops below right around 10% maybe a little bit below 10%. That's that's the bad news. The the other bad news is that the multiples have not contracted consistent with the contraction of earnings growth contraction. So uh you've got you know the Microsofts of the world still trading at 33 times PE with 10% earnings growth. You've got the Amazon's trading at 31 times with 8.5% earnings growth. And then you shift over and you look at uh scenarios like uh small caps that are going to have 37% earnings growth in 2026 compared with the S&P 500 at 14 uh 14% earnings growth and yet the multiple for small caps you get more than double the earnings growth for you know meaningfully lower multiple I think that's where the managers are going to be forced to buy. So, you know, put yourself in the position of a hedge fund manager or a long only manager in Boston and, you know, you got nervous. Your clients, you know, told you to sell in in April. We don't know what's going to happen with this crazy crazy leadership or however they phrased it. Uh, and they got it wrong. Uh, and now you've got to catch up to the benchmark, which is now, you know, back to to highs. You can't buy those things that have risen aggressively. So you have to buy those things that have good fundamentals but the price has not yet caught up the the lagards uh that are high quality that are generating free cash less so the the shiny objects although we're still you know we're still seeing that we're still going to see that in pockets.\n\n### HEADLINES_AND_NEWS\n\n softening employment is clear. uh Fed Powell is too restrictive, but uh with the resignation of Cougler and uh Powell uh term running out May of next year, you're going to basically have four of the uh seven governors uh moving in the direction of more dovish policy and the market starting to sniff that out. and you add a little dovish policy, you bring borrowing rates down and this business, this uh economy is going to fly because uh consumers balance sheets are very underlevered. They have trillions in home equity that can be drawn once rates come down. We can relever the private sector. The public se sector obviously is overlevered. We need to to handle that and Trump is trying to do that partially with tariffs, partially with growth. uh but the public sector has really a lot of room to move once rates start to come down. So I think you're going to see a snap back after some short-term uh consolidation for sure. \n### HEADLINES_AND_NEWS\n>> Right. But something that could throw a spanner in the works um appears to be or possibly could be um the imminent tariffs on semiconductors and pharmaceuticals especially for pharmaceuticals. I mean, the president's talked about, you know, the taxes on that going up to possibly 250%. And and so, how much of an impact do you think that could pose to inflation? Um, and also what does this mean for markets, especially um in the sectors of tech and healthcare? I mean, should these uh measures be enacted, which the president said could come in a week or so? >> Yeah, this is the way President Trump negotiates. in case you haven't gotten the memo. What he does is he punches people in the face and then he offers them an ice pack and they're happy for the ice pack. So he goes in for the big ask. This is a huge ask. He's doing the same thing with India. He's doing the same thing with Canada. And if they don't cooperate and they don't come to the table to negotiate, you know what? They get hit again in the face until they\n\n### HEADLINES_AND_NEWS\nPresident Trump wants the economy to do exceptionally well. He wants the stock market to do exceptionally well. And as we saw in April, when the bond market and the stock market start to do very, very poorly, it's a reflection on him. And he comes to a more rational decision. uh and uh puts a floor under it and we move ahead and the economy continues to grow. So this time will be no different. So if you got to take a couple bumps along the way in the next 24 48 hours, so be it. But looking out 369 months, uh companies are optimistic. Companies are investing. Deal volume this year is record.\n\n### MEDIA_APPEARANCE_RECAP\nMy round table for today, Thomas Hayes, Great Hill Capital Chairman and managing member and you all finding senior reporters Brooke De Palama and Enzy Tom I mean 29 billion I mean not bad right? >> Not bad. This is a true up uh it's interesting the board said that we needed to give him this grant to keep him focused on Tesla. I mean he's got 13% of a trillion dollar company. That's 130 billion round numbers close to half of his net worth. I don't know that he needs that to keep him focused on Tesla, but maybe they need to keep him in the picture. Uh, and that's exactly what they're doing here. I mean, with the EV tax credits going away, you're seeing the big three pivot away from EVs towards hybrids and ex uh Chinese EV companies. I think Tesla is going to be the the last man standing. Uh, and they do need Elon Musk and they do need to pivot the company towards humanoid robots and towards robo taxis for it to continue to grow into its current valuation cuz uh the EV numbers haven't been great and they're not going to get much better. >> Thomas, what bothers me about this is um so Elon may stay until 2027. Dan Ives thinking 2030 yet we still have no clear plan on succession. Am I wrong to care about that or does it even matter? Is Elon Musk still driving the story? No pun intended. >> I think it's another equity grant in 2027 or 2020 2030. Look, Tesla is Elon Musk. Elon Musk is Tesla. You take him out of the picture, all that premium goes away. He's the innovator. He's the guy who slept on the factory. He's the guy who took it out of bankruptcy. He's the guy who got the government to give him all the subsidies. Uh without Elon, candidly, I don't think t\n\n### HEADLINES_AND_NEWS\nMoving along, Hong Kong ETFs in China see record inflows on dip buying spree. So we'll have earnings coming up on that. We'll probably have a deal and a handshake between Xi and Trump which will help that group. They're kind of in a waiting pattern waiting for that. as it relates uh we'll we'll deal with the intel thing, but as it relates to him with Lip Bhutan, I think it's incumbent upon Lip Bhutan to get on the PJ and uh or the CJ, the corporate jet, and go to Washington. I don't know what the hell he's been doing. Trump keeps talking about manufacturing in the US, and he's sitting in uh Irvine over here. I should go knock on his door and be like, \"Let's go, you know, uh let's go. Let's go see the Wizard, the wonderful Wizard of Oz, and and make a deal. I mean, the company, I'm sure, vetted him pretty aggressively as it relates to China ties. Um, you know, look, maybe maybe uh maybe Trump wants Kevin Hasset to run Intel. At least they would get a lot of deals done from the government. But I mean, it's amazing looking at the stock today. It's completely horrible news and the stock really isn't breaking down. And it tells you that it's just like it's so bad that it's good that if they liquidate the whole company today, you get back 20 21 $22. Uh and uh and if they don't, you know, and they fail on the fabs, you get $40, $50 over time. And if the fabs actually work and they do a deal and uh Lip Bhutan or they bring Gellzinger back or Bessant goes to run Intel, who the hell knows? Uh and they bring him a nice little round crystal uh Intel statue with a gold-plated uh base like uh Tim Cook does. all of a sudden they're going to get, you know, hundreds of billions of dollars of government support and contracts because they need to manufacture in the US and Intel is the only way to do that. I don't think they're going to subsidize Taiwan semiconductor to the same extent that they're willing to subsidize Intel to get what they need. So Trump says getting very close on extending trade China trade truce. I think this morning they said they were going to give them another extension. China's national team perfects the art of dip buying. You see here they they've been stepping in the market, supporting the market. So your bottom is in. Then now the question is what's the next catalyst to the upside? I think it's earnings. I think it's a deal. Disney's Thriving Parks are buying it. Time to figure out streaming. Uh streaming was actually better than expected as well. Disney's ESPN to acquire NFL media assets and major deal. GXO Logistics post higher second quarter revenue on new contracts. This one's ripping back from the dead. We're excited about that. We'll cover Disney. We'll cover GXO next week. Jeff, make a note. Diagio, Left for Dead. You know what I love about all these names? Uh Disney. GXO. No one's talking about them. And uh uh Dagio up huge the last week. No one's talking about it. This thing's going to continue to run. Best-in-class premiumization story. Dio Dagio sores on sales growth, cost cuts, offset tariff hit. Uh, not in anyone's on anyone's bingo card and early early days, no one talking about it. Dagio's new chief signals a spirited turnaround planned. Canada goose sales defy customer gloom as demand holds steady, CEO says. Um, again on no one's bingo cards, Christian Crown Castle names Christian Hillbrand as new CEO. He's fantastic. huge experience in global tower business. Three Fed officials voice fresh concerns over US labor market. The disscent is happening. Uh by the way, uh Powell is going to wind up neutered if Trump makes this key chess move and puts Kevin Hasset into Phil Cougler's place in August on the Fed Board of Governors. And then he also says Hasset will sit on the board of governors until Powell steps down uh voluntarily in May or involuntarily beforehand. And uh not only is he on the board of governors, but he is our chairperson in waiting. Shadowfed initiated. Powell lame duck initiated. Game over. Then rates are going to start to come down big. Real estate's going to start to boom. And I think the home building uh index is um starting to reflect that. You heard it here first. We said that was going to happen a couple of weeks ago. Now it's happening. I couldn't have predicted Cougler step stepping down. So luck, you know, sometimes better to be lucky than to be good. But if Hasset's the guy, it's game over. And then you're going to have Judy Shelton come on for the next vacancy and uh and Hasset be the Fed chair and off to the races. Uh the spoiler would be Wsh because Wsh is historically a hawk and now he's pretending to be a dove. Uh kind of a wolf in sheep's clothing which is what you saw with uh to a lesser extent Powell and then they do what they want. Uh which you know the independence of the Fed is right but you got to know what you're doing. Uh, and um, I think I think you're going to see some interesting developments in coming weeks. Next, Donald Trump says Hasset and Wash are leading contenders for the top Fed job. Treasury sore most since 2023 as traders boost rate cuts bets. That's a big deal.

So, if that's the way that they go, wouldn't be my first choice. But, uh, if the government's going to subsidize, it not it'll be fine. Okay.

That is not priced in estimates. That's why estimates are starting to go up. Healthc care stocks have been beaten up. The case for buying now. Here's from Jacob Sun and Shine over at Barons. Um, absolutely right, Jacob. And, uh, he's talking about some medical device makers, etc. We love that theme. Earning season is going really well. Don't overthink it. 10.4% earnings growth versus 4.8 expected. We had uh said that would be the case coming into the quarter. Trump urges conflicted Intel CEO Tan to resign immediately. I number one, I don't think he's conflicted. Number two, he needs to take a plane flight. If anyone has the skill to deliver Trump what he wants uh producing in the US, it's him. And believe it or not, um, to a lesser extent, if they brought Gellzinger back, he could do it, too. He was kind of at the finish line. Couple wrinkles that they have to get out. So, if that's the way that they go, wouldn't be my first choice. But, uh, if the government's going to subsidize, it not it'll be fine. Okay. Return of boring stock market and sentiment results\n\n### HEADLINES_AND_NEWS\nstock market and sentiment results",
    "### MEDIA_APPEARANCE_RECAP": "\n\n basically, we've had a huge move off the lows in April. Uh, you remember probably from the money show and certainly uh from the podcast, etc., we were extremely bullish in the hole when when people were selling handover fist. This was a man-made correction. We figured it could be solved with a one man-made tweet, and it certainly was. Uh, and the problem is is you had all these managers off sides. Actually, hedge funds dumped a trillion dollars of equities in the hole the day before liberation day. Uh, and now they are forced to play catch-up. So, they spent the first half of the 30 something% rally off the lows. Um, you know, praying for a retest. They always look for the retest which never came. Then they had to cover their shorts. So they were the first buyers which exacerbated the rally. Uh and now they're really screwed because uh not only did they sell at the wrong time, but they didn't buy to uh take advantage of the recovery. So they're dramatically they've lost both ways and most of them have material career risk. And people say, well, why does the keep market keep going up and we're trading at 22 times forward earnings? Uh and this is part of the reason. And I don't think that structural bid is going to change uh into year end because there are so many managers that got caught off sides. I'll tell you who generally got it right, who's got it right since co is the quote unquote dumb money has been right every single pullback and correction since 2020. Uh and they're right again and they made a ton of money. Uh, and I know a lot of the listeners, the hedge fund tips with Tom Hayes made a lot of money buying the lows, but uh, on a serious note, this is likely to continue into year end. So, we're entering a seasonally weak part of the year. As you know, Mike, and as a lot of people know, August, September, October tends to be the volatile periods, but a lot of people are stuck with recency bias and are thinking we're going to get a big correction at 20 20%. Uh, and they're pessimistic with the jobs numbers, and they're pessimistic with the Fed. Uh, and I think what you're going to find is that is absolutely not the case because of the conditions that I've said. and any 3 to 5% pullbacks do need to be bought because uh managers are going to have to be in the market. >> I'm glad you bring that up because I mean you can pick and choose from any number of\n\n### MEDIA_APPEARANCE_RECAP\nquestions from our amazing, incredible, sophisticated audience. Uh getting more sophisticated by the week with some extraordinary\n\nquestions. So, I invite you to stay uh if you uh first off, tomorrow morning at 10:00 am Eastern time, we're going to be on Varnian Co. Fox Business. Tune in if you're free. Uh we'll be back next next week, same time, same place with a special public company CEO segment. Uh and here we go on the",
    "ASK_ME_ANYTHING_QA": "\n\ndvice. Uh, and these are the type of things that we look for. Our downsides protected because their balance sheet income statement is is is solid. They're they're generating a ton of free cash flow to service the small amount of relative debt that they have. And they're doing it in the worst operating environment. So, two things that happen. Number one, drilling happens more when the price of oil goes up. And number two, which people aren't thinking about, drilling happens more when the cost of leverage goes down. Most of these EMP companies are have levered balance sheets. So if they can refinance at lower rates, which we expect will be the case uh in the next handful of months, uh that changes the economics to the prices that where it becomes profitable to drill based on their cost of capital. and they're going to want to take advantage of the policies in place uh to get more rigs in production uh ahead of the risk of a different type of regime coming into play. Get it in now, get it going uh even if it's at break even or slightly unprofitable and NOV will be there to provide them uh all the services that they need in order to make that happen both onshore and offshore. So we we love that. We you know we looked a lot if you look at the underweight positioning of managers etc. We we're trying to find ways to express that in energy and candidly I don't think enough of the ENTP companies have come down in price enough relative to uh the price of crude how how much that's come down. Uh so I I kept looking at the underweight and seeing that there just wasn't any opportunity that I was there wasn't enough margin of safety in the exploration and production names in the serer names I see huge opportunity. So even if the price drops more uh with a company like NOV Inc. Uh the margin of safety is such that I don't have to worry about it and if it goes against me before it doubles and triples we'll buy more. \n### ASK_ME_ANYTHING_QA\n>> Got it. But listeners, if you're watching this, uh, you have any questions , now's the time to type them in, get a chance to get a few of those answered before we're done. I actually saw one question come through. And that's, uh, uh, Tom, this one says, \"S&P is up about 7 and a half% year to date. Where do and I don't know if you want to sort of take a macro opinion. Where do you see it going for the remainder of the year?\" And the second part of the question was, do you actually have a price target for a name like Gener Stanley Works? SWK. >> Yeah. So, so Stanley, so Generrack, Stanley Black & Decker and QXO, which is Brad Jacobs roll up of uh building supply is is our theme for our housing recovery play and that's going to be a function of rates coming down uh over the next 6 to 12 months. Um, so in in terms of our price targets, uh, we don't publicly say them, but I would say uh, for Stanley Black & Decker, uh, it's at least double from here. Generex got more gas in the tank. Uh, for sure, mid200s, uh, will probably be fully out, mid to high 200s. Um, and we'll trim some along the way, etc. QXO is just getting started. That's going to be an 8 to10 year roll up play that probably goes to $80 to $100 plus with Brad Jacobs. That guy knows how to compound capital. We got in at 12 $12 and change. It quickly went on the beacon. It doubled to 25. Now I think it's at 20. Uh so that could be a four bagger over the next 6 to 8 years from these levels. Maybe five bagger. And he tends to underpromise and overd deliver. So he'll probably have some rabbits he pulls out of the hat. He's an awesome. So, so we look for these themes and and what you can see from uh from the themes is we buy when they're out of favor, when they're not in the\n\nquestions , now's the time to type them in, get a chance to get a few of those answered before we're done.

And he tends to underpromise and overd deliver. So he'll probably have some rabbits he pulls out of the hat. He's an awesome. So, so we look for these themes and and what you can see from uh from the themes is we buy when they're out of favor, when they're not in the headlines , when people aren't talking about them, and we sell when they start to be in the news every day and become the new shiny objects of tomorrow and people can't get enough, we help them out and lay off the shares. As far as the S&P 500, look, we're in a seasonally weak part. It wouldn't surprise me to see 3 to 5% pullbacks consolidate some of the gains. uh but I think we resolve higher into year end. So, uh, it wouldn't surprise me to see us, you know, if we go back to 62, 6,100, uh, that we don't finish the year at, you know, 6600, 60,6650, 6700 type type of thing because, uh, you still have 14% earnings growth next year. You still have a lot of opportunity on the surface. I do think if you're exclusively in indices or the companies that have already moved a lot or that everyone's crowded into, I think you're going to underperform. This goes back to the conversation. It's not an eitheror, it's a both end. They mag 7 can go up from here. I think they will go up less on a relative basis than those lagards that people have to chase to catch their benchmarks and keep their jobs uh and those stocks that uh haven't moved as much that are going to be the the leaders for the second half of 2025. So so that's how I would think about it. Um, so it doesn't mean you you have to get out of one set of companies just because the others. It just means you might lighten up a little bit one group and start to add some of the other group that you you're underexposed. Got it. A question for on just came in actually. It says, \"Do you think if oil drops to say $50, then do you think the tech technicals will push the riskless or fundamental price much lower than 13?\" >> I could care less. We'll be buyers. I hope I hope oil falls to 40 and we can buy a ton of stock at $8. Uh because if I look three to five years out, I've got, you know, 40 $50 stock. So, if I get to buy more at eight, I'd be super happy about that. I don't I don't think about or even worry about the the short-term voting machine based on emotions or $50 oil. Uh I think that benefits National Oil Wellvarco as a leader in what they do. It would hurt its competitors more than it would hurt it because it's got the strongest balance sheet. It's got the greatest expertise. It's got the highest install base. Uh and and their business profitability is less dependent on the price of oil because of the existing stall install base and the servicing. So it's not without risk to the price of oil, but it's lower risk, which is why we chose to express our interest in out of favor energy through uh through this particular company because of uh accounting for the possibility of lower oil prices in the short term. >> Got it. Well, I think that's the last question that I saw come in and my my watch is about to say we're kind of at the the end of our time here, but Tom, thank you so much honestly for joining in this discussion. viewers, if if you're listening to this again, check out hedge fund tips. Check out some of the work Tom does. Uh you'll see him on TV as well, talking about, you know, some of just a different way of thinking about investing. Uh really thinking about the types of investors that have won long term that have those track records. It's in the value space and he's got the numbers to prove it. So Tom, thank you so much for sharing your insights and your picks and look forward to talking again in the future. >> Appreciate it. Thanks so much, Mike. >> Take care. And we're back. ### MEDIA_APPEARANCE_RECAP\nUh, and then I had the pleasure of joining Liz on CNA Asia, which is like the BBC of Asia. Huge channel. Thanks to Marian Star In also thanks obviously to David Lynn and thanks uh especially to Andrew Keys for joining us on that uh great explanation of Ethereum. Uh, and this was general market. >> Thomas Hayes uh, chairman and managing member Greatill Capital joins us for more now. Thomas, thanks for your time this morning. So, markets have been pretty much on a choppy ride. Uh, and this latest pullback has been attributed to the weaken than expected uh services data as well as new tariff comments from the president on the farmer and uh the semicon sectors. I mean, how would you characterize the current state of the market? >> Well, we've had an enormous move off the lows, Liz, some 30%. So, we're consolidating gains and we're moving into a seasonably weak part of the year. Usually, August, September, and early October have a little bit of volatility. So, it's natural to have some consolidation. However, I wouldn't get too bearish because you have too many managers that are behind the benchmark and every dip of 3 to 5% will be bought. The question is is where are they going to put that money? And are they going to put that money in uh Magnificent 7 which has already moved a lot and has shown while they had good earnings that their earnings growth is decelerating. As a matter of fact, Q3 will be the first quarter that Magnificent 7 earnings are 10% or below 10%. That's down from 33% last year. Or like you saw today, the only index that was up was the small cap index. Are managers going to buy the lagards, the the small caps and the most shorted stocks, which has have actually outperformed the indices? The most shorted stocks have outperformed the indices by 11% in the last 6 to 7 weeks. So, I think what you're going to see is volatility, short-term consolidation at the index level, which is predominantly magnificent 7, and real opportunity and real buying starting to happen under the surface for the unmagnificent 493. the remainder of the S&P 500 and small caps. And now that you saw the odds of a cut in September going over 90% today after the largest revision in jobs data in 50 years that we saw on Friday. I think it uh points to things to be constructive moving forward uh as you look out 3 to 6 months even if you get a little chop in the next 3 to 6 weeks. >> Right. Gotcha. So I just want to take a look at some of the uh reasons for this uh dip in market moves overnight and one of that was the ISM services data which showed uh weakening activity but persistent price pressures. I mean with services sector representing quite a significant part of the US economy in fact 70%. I mean how are you viewing this stagnation especially as also we're seeing uh the data showing slowing jobs growth. Yeah, there's no question the Fed needs to cut or they're going to be it is going to be a question of too late Powell. But what you've seen for the last couple of years is you had this huge pull forward of goods during COVID and then everyone got loaded up with goods and we went to uh aggressive service spending while good spending fell and now you're seeing a a resumption of goods overtaking services. So yes, t\n\n### TECHNICAL_CHARTS\nfinally starting to go up as we anticipated. Uh, now up to 301.60. I think it got down to $2.99. You can see them turning abruptly up. We had talked about the first half of the year being the revised down. Second half revised back up. And here we go. All right. Now, on to the\n### ASK_ME_ANYTHING_QA\n\n### ASK_ME_ANYTHING_QA\nquestions  from our amazing, incredible, sophisticated audience. Uh getting more sophisticated by the week with some extraordinary\n\n### MEDIA_APPEARANCE_RECAP\nquestions . So, I invite you to stay uh if you uh first off, tomorrow morning at 10:00 am Eastern time, we're going to be on Varnian Co. Fox Business. Tune in if you're free. Uh we'll be back next next week, same time, same place with a special public company CEO segment. Uh and here we go on the\n\n### ASK_ME_ANYTHING_QA\nask me anything\n\n### ASK_ME_ANYTHING_QA\nquestions . Here we go from Nicholas Brent. Uh Nicholas says, \"I spam links to your stuff in all of my group chats.\" uh question on Cooper earning. Well, thank you. By the way, if you're getting value, I you know, some of you can't afford to be clients uh or trade service or even buy a hat. Just tell your friends if you have friends that are investors in the stock market and would benefit from this. The number one compliment you can pay me is recommend the podcast to one or two or even better the video cast if you really want them to get value uh to one or two of your close friend or family members that would benefit. that is the greatest way to uh pay it forward and I appreciate that. So, spamming links to your group chats. I don't know about that, but uh it's the thought that counts.\n\n### ASK_ME_ANYTHING_QA\nquestions . Here we go from Nicholas Brent. Uh Nicholas says, \"I spam links to your stuff in all of my group chats.\" uh question on Cooper earning.\n\n### ASK_ME_ANYTHING_QA\n\non Cooper earnings. Should we think about near-term catalyst differently? I think you've generally focused on US AutoSAR, but that forecast was taken down. However, in earnings call, it seems like geographic China volume shift is more important along with potential refinancing, but that's dependent on credit upgrade. Um, it's all about USR. I don't think about short-term. I think about it re I have no control over when it reaches full intrinsic value which I determine before I enter any position. Uh, all I can and some do it way faster than I expect. Hopefully after 12 months so that I don't have to pay short-term capital gains. Most of the time it takes about three years. Uh, so I I don't I don't worry about that short-term noise. I worry about USSAR and if they if USSR recovers as we're seeing with the incentives with everything else we discussed on the um I think it was with David Lyn, no it was probably with Mike Larson. Uh this thing is going to be a cash machine. So everything about Cooper Standard is in that segment. Uh Allan asks about Trump versus Intel. We've covered that. It really doesn't matter as long as they make a deal with the US government and the US government needs them. So, um, we feel comfortable. I like Lip Bhutan. I thought Gellzinger was fine. He was close to the finish line. The board had approved all the spending. The spending went a little bit crazy, but um, it doesn't matter. I I prefer Lip Bhutan. So, hopefully he can get on a plane, bring Trump a plaque, cut a deal, and Intel can double. So, um, use this as a catalyst. probably this is Trump's way of saying like why the hell haven't you come out here like um Jensen Wong, like Tim Cook or Tim Apple. Uh time to get on a plane and and talk. And I think uh I think he's absolutely right. I think Lipu has been so focused on turning around the company, he hasn't thought about the most important customer. Uh and he should go ahead and do that.\n### ASK_ME_ANYTHING_QA\nJohn H asks, \"Morning Tom. Recent listener. Still trying to wrap my head around your turnaround business valuation stubbled upon fossil. thought it might be worth looking at. Uh, let's take a look at Fossil. I generally hate this type of business, but um, as a matter of fact, I don't know if this was during our podcast. No, this was way before I I remember when this thing was trading up around $140. It was some ridiculous valuation. I was like, this thing is a bag of You know what? So, now it's down from 139 down to a buck. Let's see if it's interesting at all. I probably still don't like it a I didn't like it at 139. I probably still don't even like it at a buck. Let's see. Negative free cash flow. Revenues in secular decline. No signs of turnaround. Margins are going up. Um, okay. So, you stopped discounting, but you also stopped selling. So your, you know, your revenues are down 66%. This is a this is I mean it's a cigar butt. Maybe you get one last puff out of it. Let's see what the balance sheet looks like. This is not what we do. So they got 125 million of cash. 160. Okay. So they'll live another day. Their balance sheet is fine. I I don't like this. I mean, can you buy it at a buck and hope it goes to five bucks? Sure. But they better come out with some really amazing watches or get Sydney Sweeney to do some hot ad about wearing fossil watches. Zack Tan, uh, longtime listener, big fan. My question is this. Do you think the administration's policies are benefiting uh, the largest companies disproportionately? No, I think it's just the market's just adjusting to it. I I don't spend a lot of time worrying about policy. I I spend a lot of time worrying about company by company execution and I ignore the short-term price. And all of them are executing on all all four cylinders and um finding their way around the tariff issues and uh it's just a short-term hiccup in a long-term play for massive recovery. Tommy Gardner heard you say a couple episodes getting your CFA is vital. Yeah, it's critical when you're young and you don't know anything and you have no business experience. So yeah, it's uh he goes, \"Is it worth it?\" Of course, it's worth it. I mean, you have nothing else to bring to the table coming out of college. is like, \"Oh, you took a finance course. No one cares.\" So, uh I think that gives you 10 years of experience in two or three years. And uh it just saves you from trial and error and probably gets you uh a better job and um more skilled at um financial analysis in a shorter period of time. Um Jack M be graduating in the spring. Curious on your view of wealth management firms, specifically family family offices. Talking to some other seasoned finance folk. Most said don't start there as it's a hard pivot. Somewhat concentrated. Curious if you had any thoughts on that side of things. Always appreciate the support for younger guys and girls. Um Jack, I would say work for someone that you like and respect where you can learn a lot. Um, if you can get into a big bold, you know, if you went to a good school and you can get into a big firm like Goldman and do their analyst training, that's going to be a huge advantage. If you didn't go to a good school, take what job you can get and work your ass off and prove yourself. Uh, and if that's a family office or wealth management and this is what you want to do with the rest of your life, then start there. Um, you can always pivot. Rachel, okay, invited to a podcast. Gabriel S, thanks for the tremendous value of allowing AMA. Could you please take a look at DLO? Okay, you're welcome. Let's see here. [Music] All right. So, negative free cash flow. Revenues are getting up. Margins are starting to recover. Cash flow might starting be starting to recover. Uh what do they do? I think it's like an online platform. Uh payment processing paying solutions remittance in Montivo Uruguay. Uh I'm not taking country and company and everything risk. I it might work, but that's just too speculative. There's so many variables that have to go right and things that I don't understand that I don't want to be involved. Um Jason Zen, I asked several AIs from chat GPT to deep sea to give uh and they all give me a 70% or higher probability that Cooper Standard has the material science and synergy to be a supplier for humanoid robots. Eg. Forrex being used for feet stabilization. thoughts on this being an AI hallucinagated pipe dream or logical expansion being considered by the executive team? Thanks for all you do. I I don't know. It's not in my model. I could care less. I mean, I can forward it on, but if they're in sneakers, they're probably looking at it. That would just be It's not in my underwriting. And what what also wasn't in my initial underwriting is the fact that they're now selling more parts per car with hybrids uh and to a lesser extent EVs. and they make more money per car than I had initially estimated. Uh, which means I probably should take my estimates up, but I like to be conservative. So, as far as humanoid robots, I mean, I I could really care less. I It's just whipped cream, not baked in. Wouldn't bet on it. And um, we'll see what happens. Uh, Lulu, if you want to bet make a bet on humanoid robots, buy Tesla. Uh, Lulu, and by the way, I don't own Tesla. Lulu is starting to look interesting at these prices. Hoping for it to go below $180 a share. Thanks. Um, yeah, all I see is Aloe out here. I don't see anyone wearing Lulu anymore. That doesn't mean that they won't. These things are cyclical. still generating good free cash. I really liked the company a lot better when that founder ran it. That guy had personality. He was a he was a killer. Um margin still okay. Revenue is flattish but okay. Uh let's see here. Yeah, it's pretty darn conservative. Uh I mean they're going to face continued competitive pressures. Uh obviously the stock is pricing a lot of that in. Yeah, I think at 180 you got to maybe take a strong look at getting involved. Uh, free cash flow is still solid. Balance sheet's good. I mean, when you're generating that amount of cash, you have a lot of options. You can buy fast growing small brands. You can buy back stock. You can issue a dividend. Uh I think I think it's okay, Max. Uh I'd have to understand how they're dealing with competitive pressures, and that's probably going to come from listening to four or five um conference calls, but it's probably okay, and we'll probably never do anything with it. Uh, Simon Stasunus. You know, the thing about brands is they're very cyclical. And what I love about VF Corp is number one, it's priced for bankruptcy and it's not going bankrupt. Number two, it's got a complete winner during the turnaround situation. And number three is I have a lot of outs. When I got involved, they had uh Supreme also, which they used to pay down $1.5 billion of debt. That took bankruptcy off the table. They got four or five other brands. Some are going to be slower when others are going. So, like if I'm dealing with customer preferences, I love having that portfolio versus relying on one specific name. Um, but I but I do think Lulu is going to be okay. Simon Stasunus, thoughts on Taylor Wimpy, British homebuilder? 9% yield. I mean, this thing wasn't even doing well when you had lower rates. So, let's see if anything's going to change. All right. I mean, the revenues haven't grown in a decade. They're they're down from a decade ago. I I don't think so. Not enough margin of safety. If you want to buy it for the dividend, just buy something else. Uh Rob, we never buy a stock for a dividend. Rob Dillingham, uh wondering looking into energy thoughts about energy transfer. It's fine, but you're never going to make a lot of money. It's just for the dividend. We don't like midstream. No, I wouldn't buy it up here. No way. Absolutely too late. Nope. Not for me. These things were beat down for a while. I mean, it's like buying a You're better off buying a tea bill. So, no, they're better plays in energy where you have more upside. KD Modi, I know it's too early to take a look at Indian markets. Uh I I don't I don't even think I we can't buy individual Indian names. No, can't help you on that one, partner.

Um like to see it a couple bucks lower, but I I think you could probably I think at 15 is when I start to get interested. This is not going to recover right away. It's it's blown up a lot of people, but I do think you're on the right track with that. And I I don't think you get hurt here if you take a three to five year view, but if you can get it lower, it makes the confidence level go up. Uh Paul, question on Adobe. Uh I'm not doing anything on Adobe right now because I can't model how, you know, you look at Grock images. A lot of the things that Adobe did, you can do for free in a minute on uh any of the AI platforms. So, for that reason, I'm going to just pass on a purely financial and technical basis. I'd probably be like, \"Yeah, of course.\" And that'll probably prove to be true. But I can't I can't predict that. So, it goes in my too hard pile. Areas that are never going out of style. This is a hard question, but I mean obviously AI is not going to build a house. So, home building, real estate, um, chemicals. I mean, I I think I think where you're going to lose in life is if you go into an industry because you think that's the industry where you'll make the most money versus where that's the industry you have a natural aptitude, interest, and you're going to work 24 hours a day but not feel like you're working. So, find something you're interested in. Find where you can deliver value. income never exceeds the value you deliver to the marketplace and if it does for a temporary basis it will quickly revert back to the value that you are providing. Um um so I just think it's the odds of being a successful entrepreneur are much higher than the odds of being a successful investor. you're competing against the smartest people in the world and um you have to go through cycles. You have to experience it and and the the you know 1/100th of 1% that make it through the mill wind up making exceptional incredible amounts of money. But they're few and far between. So the odds are against you. Whereas if you're an entrepreneur can start a business, fail, start a business, fail, start a business, make a ton of money. And it's a natural thing uh in America. It's not an exceptional thing. and and uh uh so that's that. Uh but there's no guarantee you're going to get really good at it. And um the early tell will have to be you have to really love it and you're already doing it 24 hours. So it's not even a question should I do this or start a business. It's like this is the only thing I would ever want to do. And for 99.9% of the people, that's not the case. They can kid themselves that that's the only thing they want to do because they feel like it's the way that they'll make the most money. But the people who make the most money, it's it's such a small filter after millions of people have tried. Uh hey Daryl, regarding Intel, when do you think the turnaround will happen? It's going to take three to five years. Uh, do they have any new gamecher technology? No. They're the leader of inferior chips. Uh, potential acquisition target by one or the other big chip makers possibly. That's what Trump is pushing for. Um, but I think you just have to let it play out. Your downsides mostly protected. Your upside is 4550 bucks if they fail on the fabs and the advanced chips and unlimited 100 plus if they get the fabs and the chips correct which is um kind of you know our base case would be 4550 but our level of confidence that they ultimately do because there's no other game in town for the higher upside is like I'd say 70 75% confidence level that it's way more than a $40 $50 stock. Um, and they and they implement as far as timeline, I don't know. I don't care. They usually take about three to five years. Uh Paul Girtz, I think Axalta coding looks kind of interesting. Okay. A XTA Yeah, I just don't think the upside is high enough for this. I mean, you probably make 50% if you're right over the next two to three years. that's not going to meet my IRRa hurdle, but I generally think, let's see what the balance sheet looks like. It's a little more leverage than I like for that type of business. $500 million of cash, $3.5 billion of debt for a low grower. I think there are higher and better uses of your money until these revenues really start to reacelerate for 50% upside with that leverage. No way. It's got to be like 2x, 3x, 4x. Landon H. Thoughts of NBR trading. It'll probably work, but it's not what we're here for. neighbors. I prefer Varco, but let's just take a look here. Still negative free cash flow. $2 and half billion dollars of debt, 400 million of cash. Not ideal. Again, why I like natural oil while Elvarco much better balance sheet. Uh let's see what else here. I I think it's going to work on a trading basis. I I don't like this as much. You got to be careful with balance sheets when you get into the energy sector. keep increasing the share count. Probably works for a trade, but I don't like this one as much. BDX like the theme. Beckon Dickinson. It's the same type of theme as uh Baxter. Uh let's see. BDX Short answer, it's probably okay. Long answer, you got a lot of work to do before you commit capital. The upside's not big enough for me. There's not bags in this. There might be a double in it. Not that interesting. Drew Robinson. Fizz F. Yeah, it's it's meh. It's okay. Not for me. Uh Josh Kaplan Five serve. buy in shares, get good free cash flow. I I mean this is uh merchant solutions and all this stuff. I'm not crazy about this business. partially because of the reasons that Andrew gave on the call. The one that I want to be involved in for the next three years and out is is PayPal. I think that's the one. I think the others are going to hit margin compression over time and potentially uh PayPal will as well, but I think right now they're in the right space at the right time and it's so cheap and they have so much optionality and they have a dynamic turnaround leader that I want to participate. But this is not really one that gets me excited despite the numbers looking good on paper. KWR, you know, it's funny, there's an old saying, everyone tries to like find this perfect formula and etc. And it's like there's the old saying, the young man knows the rules, the old man knows the exceptions. And the only way you can know the exceptions, like you could look at all these companies and be like, oh, you know, cash flow is doing this, why doesn't he like it? It's, you know, he's contradicting himself. It's because I've been to all these movies a million times before and I know where the rules apply and I know where they don't. And that's that's the tremendous value ad. Uh KWR uh it's you got to have a sound framework and then you got to know the exceptions, which is uh a whole art unto itself. Um KWR Quaker. Again, I like this theme. It's kind of okay on that front. Yeah, I'm not in love with this one, but I think it's going to work for you. So, I think that's pretty decent. It's not one that I would be in, but um thanks for sending it in. U a try looking for value. Love to take a look at Japan. I I I will never buy a Japanese stock. They're done. Um, unless it's a big multinational WDB. Here we go. problem you're going to have with Japan for the foreseeable future is their central bank is going to have to be raising rates while the rest of the world is lowering rates and yen is going to appreciate massively and it's going to hurt all of they're basically an export-driven country with no significant natural resources with horrible demograph traffic. It's like the the trifecta of uh bad news. So, um you know, you get all these value guys jumping in and they've been stuck in these value traps for 10 years and then they get these bouts of rallies and they think it's going to be the time and it just never works. So, uh for that reason, I'm out. warehouses. I'd rather have GXO. You have Brad Jacobs involved. You don't have I don't know who the management is for this. And it's a hard B. Well, geez. I don't see anything wrong with it fundamentally. Um, not a big fan of French companies. Generally speaking, you can't fire people. Um, but, uh, obviously LVMH has done just fine. Cash. Oh, wow. This is, if these numbers are correct, this is excessively levered. $3 billion of debt, 10 million of cash. So, double check that. You could lose all your money if that's true. So, uh, I'd probably pass one on it being French and two on the balance sheet, but just double check those numbers because they're not always right on KOIN or any other service that's not an SEC public filing directly from the company. \n\n\n### ASK_ME_ANYTHING_QA\nunless it's a big multinational.

As the rates have rolled back over, what's happening to the housing index, home builder index is going straight up, which is a core theme that we are playing through Generrack, which is, you know, nearly doubled off its recent lows now in a handful of weeks.

You you got to play the hand that you're dealt versus being an idealist. It should be this way. It should be that way. I don't care how it should be. I care how it is.

This is from Carson, but you can see we are early in a secular bull. I discussed that with David. This is a great chart. Uh rolling 10-year relative performance of small cap stocks versus large cap stocks. This is when you want to be a ba massive buyer. You had the biggest outperformance in the shortest period of time from 2001 to 2007, from 1954 to basically 1983, uh from 1936 to 1947. So, um, you know, I I actually had someone text me and said, you can't make this stuff up. I mean, um, they said, I think you're wrong on small caps because over the last, hold on, I'll read it. I mean, I over the last 11 weeks or 12 weeks, the S&P is up 12% off the lows and small caps are only up 11%. I I I can't help people like that. Um, but um they exist, so it is what it is. Uh what we try to do here is  we try to skate to where the puck is going. And um when it turns, it turns all at once. So what is a 1 or 2% underperformance the last however many weeks will be 30 to 40% outperformance over the next 20 40 months. And uh and then they'll say what happened and they'll be the ones that got phase planted because they were chasing stocks at 100 times sales that fell 75% because they missed one quarter by 3%. So, um, but if if if people like that didn't exist, we would be out of a job because emotional people are what creates the opportunities for us to buy incredibly beautiful, boring, durable businesses at exceptional prices and then just wait for them to revert to the mean over time uh and and outperform in that regard. So, um, moving on,\n\n### TECHNICAL_CHARTS\nWe don't know. We'll we'll see. Uh doesn't really matter. Here's the 10-year cycle peak. Hit this high high level. 10-year yield. Probably goes back to the top of this line, not below this line. Um 10-year 30-year, which we discussed. Here's the US dollar. It's amazing. Everyone's panicking that the US dollar is going to hell and it's going to go away and everything else. It's still super strong relative to history. It would be natural for it to break this trend line and and go lower and lower over the next few years before resuming its next uptrend. And right now, I think we are in a downtrend. We'll have these counter trend rallies, but the dollar is going to continue to weaken, which helps international, also helps US earnings. The Canadian dollar, everyone was um apoplelectic, scared about the looney. I said, my Canadian friends, uh have no fear. The the strong looney is here. It started to happen. It's early days. So, if you have loonies, I would not be trading them out. I would be hoarding them like nobody's business. you are going to be having massive purchasing power over the next few years. Uh gold that seems to have topped out. We'll see how that plays out. And people say, well, how can you have a view that dollar weakens and gold tops out? And the answer is it's happened many times in history. Zoom out. Uh crude, you know, crude is uh continues to be in a downtrend. Does this stop at the 40s? Does it stop at 66 before going up? The answer is we don't know. I think that um the types of businesses that we're in, the margin of safety is large enough. We've got National Oil Well, Varco, which we love. The balance sheet cash flow less sensitive to price. Comtock Resources has done its back and fill. We were buying some for new clients this week while uh some of you were puking it out.

You know, I was reading some of the comments in uh David Lynn's video from from those folks, and they the takeaway I got from some of the comments, and I probably shouldn't read the comments, but uh I'm always entertained by them, was that they think my view on rates has to do with politics. And I think for those of you who have been around long enough, um, number one, probably for many years, you couldn't tell whether I was Republican or Democrat anyway. Uh, which is a good thing because we're here to talk about business. Um, and number two, I call him as I see him. I mean, this whole thing with Lip Bhutan is, uh, complete disaster and a stupid decision by the administration. So, I I'll call him exactly how I see him. Uh, I'm not a huge fan of tariffs, okay? it's going to work out because of the way they've done it. But I don't I wouldn't have gone about it in that specific way. But it is what it is. You you got to play the hand that you're dealt versus being an idealist. It should be this way. It should be that way. I don't care how it should be. I care how it is. And then how am I going to win based on the hand that I'm dealt? So um so when I talk about cutting rates with housing as 16% of GDP that's material with the cracks in the labor market and### MACRO_DATA_SLIDES\nhere is  the labor market and by the way the multi-month revisions were the highest in downward in 50 years and this guy is asleep at the wheel. And the reason that, you know, and you'll you'll see in some of their comments, they're like, \"Oh, the stock market's at all-time highs. Uh, you know, prices are still up. What's he talking about uh cutting rates?\" Because when this turns, you can't fix it the way you can fix it if you're wrong and you cut too soon and you can raise 25, 50, 75 basis points, get inflation back under control. Getting deflation under control is so costly and so painful in terms of the jobs lost. And once fear starts, it compounds aggressively that it it can't be uh fixed very quickly. So that's why I talk in those terms, not in terms of a political view or uh anything else. The other thing that you should keep in mind is um this is something that people aren't talking about and you're going to hear it first. interest rates on government debt is consuming 17% of government spending. Okay, we we kind of know that. Everyone knows that. Here's something that you probably don't hear every day. Keeping rates artificially high creates an environment where the traditional inflating fighting tool, higher interest rates, can over time become inflationary itself. Higher rates raise interest payment costs which are then financed with more government borrowing. Without the offset of higher taxes or lower spending, the debt grows. More money is pumped into the economy in the form of treasury securities. On net, public receives more income. So the higher rates eventually become a form of stimulus, driving up demand and prices. And that's the thing that people aren't talking about is the four and a half percent in money markets that people are making tons of money and you say well why let them make their money they need fixed income etc. Um but that in effect is a self-fulfilling prophecy and when you have government spending 17% on interest payments you can't afford that. So when Trump talks about um we are paying you know he says we should cut 300 basis points that's crazy but that's what Trump does. He does this you know he asks for two or three times what he thinks is realistic and then he gets 100 basis points or 150 basis points which is probably right. I think a 100 would be enough. Um even 75 would actually be enough. Uh and that would, you know, 100 basis points would cut interest payments by $300 billion a year. That does an awful lot for the deficit. Uh 200 basis points would be 600 billion. He's asking for, you know, 300 basis points would be which would be a trillion. That's a big big deal. Uh so I I I don't think people are thinking enough about the double-edged sword that high interest rates can actually be inflationary itself because of the increased issuance to service that excess 600 or $900 billion of unnecessary interest rate payments and the additional income. uh that it's basically like giving out stimulus checks for everyone who has fixed income securities or a checking account that's earning interest. Uh so it's something to be uh very mindful of. Healthcare S&P 500 weight uh guys this is again these are generational opportunities when you have health care uh at the percentage weight of the S&P 500.

So, um, moving on,### MACRO_DATA_SLIDES\nhere is  the US flash report automotive sales, uh, by month. They crushed it in July relative to last year and the year before. Pretty much one, two, three, four, five out of the last seven months has been a big outperformance from the year before. So when you see Cooper Sander taking down industry volumes because of the wherever they get their data from S&P uh has taken it down, I think that will wind up being too conservative and I think their guidance as a result will wind up being too conservative and that's what we want is massive upside surprises like we saw in the most recent quarter. Um, US consumer confidence. These are times when it pays to be a buyer, not a seller. Markets don't have secular tops when consumer confidence is this low. They have secular tops when it's super high, like 200 um 2006, 2021. Uh this is the lowest it's been since the 2009 and 2011 lows, the debt crisis and the great financial crisis. And then going back from there, you have to go back to 1979 and 1974, which were major lows. So, we like this setup. Let's go over to some um"

I learned so much listening to this. I think my audience is going to learn a lot listening to this and we wish you incredible success. >> Thank you. >>",
      "And then let's get down to the media. So, first and foremost, I want to uh introduce you to Andrew Keys. He is the founder and uh co-founder and the chairman of the Ether Machine, the ticker DY NX. You'll see all the full disclosures at the beginning of this and uh we'll go into it. And this is kind of not what we normally cover on the podcast, but I do think that understanding what's going on with this technology is extremely valuable. So, we made an exception. And what I thought would be a 10 to 15 minute segment uh turned out to be more. And it turned out to be more because the information that Andrew was sharing was so incredibly valuable in terms of a a peak into the future and comparing it to the past kind of the advent of the internet and other aspects. So I think this is going to be helpful for you just in terms of general knowledge. So uh listen in here to welcome everyone. We have an ex extremely special guest today. the co-founder and chairman of the Ether Machine, my friend Andrew Keys. And we have to do a bunch of full disclosure here, Andrew. Uh first off, uh we became friends on the golf course. I was invited to speak at a family office conference in Puerto Rico and you have a place down in in Dorado. And I I remember telling the host uh they're like, \"What do you need? We'll pay your full freight.\" I was like, \"Look, I'll go down there and do this thing on one condition.\" They're like, \"What's that?\" I was like, \"I want to play Dorado.\""

    "PYPL": [
      "the Ether machine. Um so, one of our holdings is we own PayPal. uh do you know and PayPal is with Andrew Chris he's Alex Chris is trying to be uh innovative and you see to your point like you could send stable coins you could pay with crypto they're the sixth largest issuer of stable coins so they're they're kind of on the cutting edge of this how will they be helped or hurt by these developments uh in your view well so I I think that PayPal is interesting in the sense that you you nailed it that they have been one of the first movers they have a top 10 uh stable coin Uh that said, you know, their business is to kind of sit as an intermediary between, you know, counterparties. Yeah. uh you know what you know I I kind of gave like the technical devil's advocate or proponent to uh you know the thinning of the intermediary layer but there are there are kind of fundamental ad values that a company like PayPal has like let's call it like the govern uh the global regulatory compliance that they have you know in you know a 100 different jurisdictions uh like that money transmission business I think is is something that that they're going to have kind of incumbent upon them. But I think that you're going to you're going to see a thinning. PayPal, Mastercard, Ammex, you know, where where you're able to do this and basically the AML KYC is going to be done uh at the identity layer instead of at the intermediary layer. So basically, in order to transact, you're going to have to have your wallet that that is the Tom wallet, not the PayPal wallet, and KYC approved. And and and basically, you'll have to have attributes about yourself. So facts about yourself. Maybe it's your uh bank statement or or your mortgage that that that deems exactly where you live for AMLKYC. And then like attributes about yourself or excuse me, attestations about yourself. to like your reputation, you know, does Tom have good credit? Does is Tom good in different transactions? And then you're going to have this self-s sovereign digital identity where it's owned by the individual rather than owned by the intermediary. So, you know, a good example of this is if you take 10,000 Ubers and you get five stars because you're a gentleman and you want to go rent an Airbnb, that reputation of your 10,000 five-star uh transactions is not portable. And I bet if you take 10,000 nice Ubers, uh when you go to rent uh your Airbnb, you'd probably be a pretty good tenant of the house. But that reputational attribute doesn't kind of sit with you. So what we're going to see is is is this technology creates a self-s sovereign based internet rather than logging into Facebook or logging into PayPal or logging into the these other apps. um we're going to start seeing the user have more uh sovereignty and and power. So I I think the way to think about it and correct me if I'm wrong is like the PayPal that have networks of 438 million people in the short term they're going to benefit from this transition in that they're the first mover and that if I want to pay for something with stablecoin or or or crypto or whatever it's it's there. So for like the next three years they're going to be like the innovator. when we look four or five years out that mar they're gonna have margin compression as as they're whittleled away and by then we'll be out at a double. So uh on to the All right now to the Ethereum machine why we're here.",
      "The one that I want to be involved in for the next three years and out is is PayPal. I think that's the one. I think the others are going to hit margin compression over time and potentially uh PayPal will as well, but I think right now they're in the right space at the right time and it's so cheap and they have so much optionality and they have a dynamic turnaround leader that I want to participate. But this is not really one that gets me excited despite the numbers looking good on paper. KWR, you know, it's funny, there's an old saying, everyone tries to like find this perfect formula and etc. And it's like there's the old saying, the young man knows the rules, the old man knows the exceptions. And the only way you can know the exceptions, like you could look at all these companies and be like, oh, you know, cash flow is doing this, why doesn't he like it? It's, you know, he's contradicting himself. It's because I've been to all these movies a million times before and I know where the rules apply and I know where they don't. And that's that's the tremendous value ad. Uh KWR uh it's you got to have a sound framework and then you got to know the exceptions, which is"

If it's under two and a half times, they would not sell equity because that gets to a point where it starts being dilutive to shareholders rather than accreative. And we we will be similarly opportunistic. And my whole benchmark of this vehicle is Ether concentration per share.

Amazon stock was down 90% from 2000 to 2002 2003 and it wasn't down 90% from 2002 to 2002 2003 because we were in a recession okay because the fundamentals of Amazon's business in each of those years 2000 2001 2002 2003 continued to improve revenues continued to improve cash flow continued to improve earnings continue to improve the price of the stock went down 90%.

You were paying for 15 years of performance uh 15 years too early. And therefore, the stock price had to correct to where the fundamentals actually were, not to where they would be. And then by the time as we got closer to 15 years out and all the things they said they were going to do in 2000 were actually happening, the price caught back up. And I think we're seeing that with a number of these super high-flying stocks right now that are doing unbelievable things and will be doing even better things 5 10 15 years out. The question is are you already paying for it? And will you have a reckoning in the intermediate term when the market says, \"Yeah, they're great.\" But you've already paid for the next 20 years of seamless perfect execution.

      "years of ZERP. So unless you're betting on ZERP coming back, uh that's probably not your highest and best use. And if you go back a h 100red years uh and you think about do I allocate you know 100% of my money to value or 100% of my money to growth. Well, if you put a million dollar in value versus growth uh in 1928 uh value you would have $68 million more dollars today because it outperforms on average about 4% not in aggregate 4% per year compounded over a hundred years. uh where people are sideways is like they were in the late 90s which is that growth has outperformed the last you know 10 years in this case therefore it's going to outperform forever uh and I think what people miss is a a great example is Amazon when you look at the palunteers and different great companies of the world Amazon was one of the greatest companies in 1999 and 2000 and we were all betting that what they said was going to happen in the future would happen in the future, which would be it would be the store of everything. They would deliver everything to your house. It would all be online, etc. And guess what? They did everything they said they were going to do over the next 15 years.

      "Mercedes and they've got to jump on the thing and then they get holding the bag like 2001 with Amazon because they bought a great business at the wrong price. So we try to buy good businesses at a great price and then we just trade out of them in three, four, five years when they've, you know, usually two to 4x because we bought them at great prices and their cash flows and revenues are very very predictable. And that's where I got the nickname Turnaround Tom. We just rinse and repeat. We buy predictable businesses. We don't have to guess the future. We don't have to play the the Bureau of Labor Statistics game on a month-to-month basis. We don't give a you know what about that stuff. What we care about is is free cash flow going up? If it's not going up, why is it not going up? Is it a temporary impairment?",
      "great example was Amazon.com. Amazon.com in 1999 two 2000 was talking about all the amazing things that they were going to do. Uh they were going to have home delivery. They were going to be the store of everything. You could buy everything online and it would be delivered to your house. Uh and here's the funny thing about Amazon in 1999 and 2000. It was trading whatever it was trading 100 times sales or one of these ridiculous uh multiples. Everything that they promised you that they would do, they have done. But do you know what happened over the next three years? The stock was down 90%. And by the way, during the period that the stock fell 90% from 2000 to 2002 or 2003, the underlying fundamentals of the business got better.",
      "earnings growth compress as they spend more and more on capex. We're waiting for that return on on investments, but the multiples haven't contracted yet. So, I do think with the weight of the MAG 7 and the S&P 500, you're going to continue to see some international outperformance in the back half of the year. The other thing that we've seen in the last month, month and a half, has been two themes. smaller and high short entrance has uh short interest has outperformed the S&P 500 by 11 full percentage points in the last 67 weeks and I think that's going to continue and the reason is is all dips have to be bought. So many managers sold in the hole over a trillion dollar of equity selling in the beginning part of April and they haven't caught up to their indices. So they've got to chase that performance and they can't chase what's already up a lot. they've got to buy those things that haven't yet moved and those are largely smaller stocks uh which are which are the most shorted right now. And if you look at earnings growth for next year, small cap earnings growth is going to be 37% versus the S&P 500 earnings growth expected to be about 14%. So you basically get more than double the earnings growth for a lower multiple."

      "about Intel. Yeah, we covered that. But, uh, if you can build a basis around 15 here, you're probably going to be fine. Yeah. So, free cash flow and revenues of gotten hit. Margins have gotten hit. All the chemical companies have gotten hit. But I kind of like these cyclical plays right now. Um like to see it a couple bucks lower, but I I think you could probably I think at 15 is when I start to get interested. A and you may not get that. This is not going to recover right away. It's it's blown up a lot of people, but I do think you're on the right track with that, Sam. And I I don't think you get hurt here if you take a three to five year view, but if you can get it lower, it makes the confidence level go up. Uh hey Daryl, regarding Intel, when do you think the turnaround will happen? It's going to take three to five years. Uh, do they have any new gamecher technology? No. They're the leader of inferior chips. Uh, potential acquisition target by one or the other big chip makers possibly. That's what Trump is pushing for. Um, but I think you just have to let it play out. Your downsides mostly protected. Your upside is 4550 bucks if they fail on the fabs and the advanced chips and unlimited 100 plus if they get the fabs and the chips correct which is um kind of you know our base case would be 4550 but our level of confidence that they ultimately do because there's no other game in town for the higher upside is like I'd say 70 75% confidence level that it's way more than a $40 $50 stock. Um, and they and they implement as far as timeline, I don't know. I don't care. They usually take about three to five years.",

He was kind of at the finish line. Couple wrinkles that they have to get out. So, if that's the way that they go, wouldn't be my first choice.

      "segment. Uh Allan asks about Trump versus Intel. We've covered that. It really doesn't matter as long as they make a deal with the US government and the US government needs them. So, um, we feel comfortable. I like Lip Bhutan. I thought Gellzinger was fine. He was close to the finish line. The board had approved all the spending. The spending went a little bit crazy, but um, it doesn't matter. I I prefer Lip Bhutan. So, hopefully he can get on a plane, bring Trump a plaque, cut a deal, and Intel can double. So, um, use this as a catalyst. probably this is Trump's way of saying like why the hell haven't you come out here like um Jensen Wong, like Tim Cook or Tim Apple. Uh time to get on a plane and and talk. And I think uh I think he's absolutely right.",
      "245 to 252. So basically, you know, 252 down to 247, the stock sells off 30%. That for me is opportunity of the a lifetime. Okay, so we've been stuffing as much as we could. Same with VFC Corp. Same with Intel. No change in any of those. And National Oil Well Varco. By the way, uh in markets, Mr. Market's eyes, that was enough to knock the stock down over 20%. You can't make this up. We had a much different reaction in the news. In fact, we will be mailing Christmas cards for the next couple of years to those who handed over their shares of Baxter uh hovers at 19 years lows. Not only are both headwinds temporary, but this guidance is what we call the morticians forecast for the back half of the year. Aka, this was sandbagging at its finest. Take the fluid conservation story. Management has already seen improvement and expects more into the back half and into 2026. Yet, their outlook assumes zero recovery this year. And even if hospitals remain cautious, these IV fluid customers have minimum volume commitments. Either they buy more or they pay more. Then there's a NOM IQ pause. The low end of the guidance now assumes it stays off the market through year end. This is despite management aiming to resume shipments as soon as possible and the decision to pause being completely voluntary. There was no FDA mandate and no requirement for a permanent fix. Even so, they chose to model zero contribution from their most important new product through year end. Here's how we see it potentially playing out. Andrew Haidider steps in this September. By his first or second earnings call, Q4, Q1, Baxter will suddenly report that Novam IQ is shipping again and flying off the shelves. Meanwhile, fluid conservation trends have magically improved. Haidider will be hailed as a miracle worker, and the turnaround will suddenly feel obvious overnight, tomorrow's newspaper today. But really, this is all just short-term noise. The big picture turnaround remains well on track. Priority number one was cleaning up the balance sheet and that box is checked. Selling the kidney care business for 3.8 billion not only brought leverage down to a projected three times by year end, it also got rid of the slowest growth and lowest margin segment of the portfolio, which means the multiple caner rate. Now it's all about execution. And the good news is this isn't the type of business that needs to reinvent the wheel. This is IV bags, pumps, hospital beds, etc. are boring, stable, and predictable. And that's Andrew Haidider's bread and butter. During his time as CEO of ATS, a company that designs and manufactures automated systems and equipment, the stock hit a peak of 5x from when he joined after just 6 years at the helm. Before that, he learned from the best at Danaher. In the case of Baxter, we think a couple clean quarters of solid execution and proof that they can get back to the four to 5% growth rate will go a long way. Management still sees a clear path back to high teens operating margins and has already made solid progress improve improving the trough of 14.3% in 2023 to 15 to 16% this year. Once it becomes obvious obvious we expect the market to reward that progress with a meaningful rerating. Baxter currently trades at just nine times earnings, the lowest we have seen since 2003 when the company was dealing with patient deaths linked to contaminated dialysis machines. That's not funny, but it's funny that the multiple is that low considering we're dealing with nothing like that at the moment. A move back towards sector average and Baxter's own historical 16 to 17 times multiple feels inevitable once the dust settles. Until then, we sit on our hands, collect the dividend, and simply let the story play out. Sooner or later, boring will be beautiful and Baxter wins that prize all day long.",

I don't know what the hell he's been doing. Trump keeps talking about manufacturing in the US, and he's sitting in uh Irvine over here. I should go knock on his door and be like, \"Let's go, you know, uh let's go. Let's go see the Wizard, the wonderful Wizard of Oz, and and make a deal. I mean, the company, I'm sure, vetted him pretty aggressively as it relates to China ties. Um, you know, look, maybe maybe uh maybe Trump wants Kevin Hasset to run Intel. At least they would get a lot of deals done from the government. But I mean, it's amazing looking at the stock today. It's completely horrible news and the stock really isn't breaking down. And it tells you that it's just like it's so bad that it's good that if they liquidate the whole company today, you get back 20 21 $22. Uh and uh and if they don't, you know, and they fail on the fabs, you get $40, $50 over time. And if the fabs actually work and they do a deal and uh Lip Bhutan or they bring Gellzinger back or Bessant goes to run Intel, who the hell knows? Uh and they bring him a nice little round crystal uh Intel statue with a gold-plated uh base like uh Tim Cook does. all of a sudden they're going to get, you know, hundreds of billions of dollars of government support and contracts because they need to manufacture in the US and Intel is the only way to do that. I don't think they're going to subsidize Taiwan semiconductor to the same extent that they're willing to subsidize Intel to get what they need.

Uh that's another energy play. I think the dark horse in all of this, I know there's a lot of noise around Intel and everyone's saying it's a, you know, baggy, you know what, but the fact of the matter is, you heard it from Trump yesterday, they've got to produce chips in the in the US and they're the only game in town.

So, so Stanley, so Generrack, Stanley Black & Decker and QXO, which is Brad Jacobs roll up of uh building supply is is our theme for our housing recovery play and that's going to be a function of rates coming down uh over the next 6 to 12 months. Um, so in in terms of our price targets, uh, we don't publicly say them, but I would say uh, for Stanley Black & Decker, uh, it's at least double from here. Generex got more gas in the tank. Uh, for sure, mid200s, uh, will probably be fully out, mid to high 200s. Um, and we'll trim some along the way, etc. QXO is just getting started. That's going to be an 8 to10 year roll up play that probably goes to $80 to $100 plus with Brad Jacobs. That guy knows how to compound capital. We got in at 12 $12 and change. It quickly went on the beacon. It doubled to 25. Now I think it's at 20. Uh so that could be a four bagger over the next 6 to 8 years from these levels. Maybe five bagger.

Again, 10-year yields down to 418. Mortgage rates uh lower than they've been in a while. Semiconductor index up against some little bit of resistance. Probably test back to this level. Uh but here's what's interesting. As the rates have rolled back over, what's happening to the housing index, home builder index is going straight up, which is a core theme that we are playing through Generrack, which is, you know, nearly doubled off its recent lows now in a handful of weeks. QXO has been up quite a bit from our basis. And then, uh, Stanley is starting to recover aggressively. So, we're excited about all that.

As that starts to tick up their operating leverage is huge. And usually with these energy companies um they have levered balance sheets. And in the case of National Oil Well Varco, they got $1.2 billion of cash. They got $1.7 billion of debt. They're generating a billion dollars of free cash flow per year in in kind of the worst part of the cycle. So, we don't have to worry about whether they're going to be here. And we, as a leader in what they do, again, the operating leverage is enormous.

They'll be generating two and three and four billion. And you're going to have a stock that goes from, you know, 12 bucks to 40 50 bucks uh over the next few years. in our opinion, not advice. Uh, and these are the type of things that we look for. Our downsides protected because their balance sheet income statement is is is solid. They're they're generating a ton of free cash flow to service the small amount of relative debt that they have. And they're doing it in the worst operating environment. So, two things that happen. Number one, drilling happens more when the price of oil goes up. And number two, which people aren't thinking about, drilling happens more when the cost of leverage goes down. Most of these EMP companies are have levered balance sheets. So if they can refinance at lower rates, which we expect will be the case uh in the next handful of months, uh that changes the economics to the prices that where it becomes profitable to drill based on their cost of capital. and they're going to want to take advantage of the policies in place uh to get more rigs in production uh ahead of the risk of a different type of regime coming into play. Get it in now, get it going uh even if it's at break even or slightly unprofitable and NOV will be there to provide them uh all the services that they need in order to make that happen both onshore and offshore. So we we love that. We you know we looked a lot if you look at the underweight positioning of managers etc. We we're trying to find ways to express that in energy and candidly I don't think enough of the ENTP companies have come down in price enough relative to uh the price of crude how how much that's come down. Uh so I I kept looking at the underweight and seeing that there just wasn't any opportunity that I was there wasn't enough margin of safety in the exploration and production names in the serer names I see huge opportunity. So even if the price drops more uh with a company like NOV Inc. Uh the margin of safety is such that I don't have to worry about it and if it goes against me before it doubles and triples we'll buy more. >> Got it. But listeners, if you're watching this, uh, you have any",
      "Okay, so we've been stuffing as much as we could. Same with VFC Corp. Same with Intel. No change in any of those. And National Oil Well Varco. By the way, uh in markets, Mr. Market's eyes, that was enough to knock the stock down over 20%. You can't make this up. We had a much different reaction in the news. In fact, we will be mailing Christmas cards for the next couple of years to those who handed over their shares of Baxter uh hovers at 19 years lows. Not only are both headwinds temporary, but this guidance is what we call the morticians forecast for the back half of the year. Aka, this was sandbagging at its finest. Take the fluid conservation story. Management has already seen improvement and expects more into the back half and into 2026. Yet, their outlook assumes zero recovery this year. And even if hospitals remain cautious, these IV fluid customers have minimum volume commitments. Either they buy more or they pay more. Then there's a NOM IQ pause. The low end of the guidance now assumes it stays off the market through year end. This is despite management aiming to resume shipments as soon as possible and the decision to pause being completely voluntary. There was no FDA mandate and no requirement for a permanent fix. Even so, they chose to model zero contribution from their most important new product through year end. Here's how we see it potentially playing out. Andrew Haidider steps in this September. By his first or second earnings call, Q4, Q1, Baxter will suddenly report that Novam IQ is shipping again and flying off the shelves. Meanwhile, fluid conservation trends have magically improved. Haidider will be hailed as a miracle worker, and the turnaround will suddenly feel obvious overnight, tomorrow's newspaper today. But really, this is all just short-term noise. The big picture turnaround remains well on track. Priority number one was cleaning up the balance sheet and that box is checked. Selling the kidney care business for 3.8 billion not only brought leverage down to a projected three times by year end, it also got rid of the slowest growth and lowest margin segment of the portfolio, which means the multiple caner rate. Now it's all about execution. And the good news is this isn't the type of business that needs to reinvent the wheel. This is IV bags, pumps, hospital beds, etc. are boring, stable, and predictable. And that's Andrew Haidider's bread and butter. During his time as CEO of ATS, a company that designs and manufactures automated systems and equipment, the stock hit a peak of 5x from when he joined after just 6 years at the helm. Before that, he learned from the best at Danaher. In the case of Baxter, we think a couple clean quarters of solid execution and proof that they can get back to the four to 5% growth rate will go a long way. Management still sees a clear path back to high teens operating margins and has already made solid progress improve improving the trough of 14.3% in 2023 to 15 to 16% this year. Once it becomes obvious obvious we expect the market to reward that progress with a meaningful rerating. Baxter currently trades at just nine times earnings, the lowest we have seen since 2003 when the company was dealing with patient deaths linked to contaminated dialysis machines. That's not funny, but it's funny that the multiple is that low considering we're dealing with nothing like that at the moment. A move back towards sector average and Baxter's own historical 16 to 17 times multiple feels inevitable once the dust settles. Until then, we sit on our hands, collect the dividend, and simply let the story play out. Sooner or later, boring will be beautiful and Baxter wins that prize all day long.",

      "questions , now's the time to type them in, get a chance to get a few of those answered before we're done. I actually saw one question come through. And that's, uh, uh, Tom, this one says, \"S&P is up about 7 and a half% year to date. Where do and I don't know if you want to sort of take a macro opinion. Where do you see it going for the remainder of the year?\" And the second part of the question was, do you actually have a price target for a name like Gener Stanley Works?",
      "Yeah. So, so Stanley, so Generrack, Stanley Black & Decker and QXO, which is Brad Jacobs roll up of uh building supply is is our theme for our housing recovery play and that's going to be a function of rates coming down uh over the next 6 to 12 months. Um, so in in terms of our price targets, uh, we don't publicly say them, but I would say uh, for Stanley Black & Decker, uh, it's at least double from here. Generex got more gas in the tank. Uh, for sure, mid200s, uh, will probably be fully out, mid to high 200s. Um, and we'll trim some along the way, etc. QXO is just getting started. That's going to be an 8 to10 year roll up play that probably goes to $80 to $100 plus with Brad Jacobs. That guy knows how to compound capital. We got in at 12 $12 and change. It quickly went on the beacon. It doubled to 25. Now I think it's at 20. Uh so that could be a four bagger over the next 6 to 8 years from these levels. Maybe five bagger. And he tends to underpromise and overd deliver. So he'll probably have some rabbits he pulls out of the hat. He's an awesome. So, so we look for these themes and and what you can see from uh from the themes is we buy when they're out of favor, when they're not in the",
      "hedge funfundtips.com and read on your own. Now, on to Stanley Black & Decker rebounding off the lows liberation day lows. Um and you can see here margins starting to reacelerate, cash flows remaining positive and strong uh despite the tariff headwind in the short term and the business re accelerating in terms of cash flow per share uh reacelerating in terms of um earnings per share etc. So despite headline numbers that crushed expectations reporting adjusted earnings of 1.08 08 per share versus 42 cents. Consensus and revenue of 3.95 billion in line with estimates. Stanley Black & Decker's solid second quarter and continued progress in the turnaround were overshadowed by the market's tariff tantrum tariff tantrum turning what was fundamentally a strong print into what looked like a weak quarter. Management guided to a potential $800 million annualized impact from tariffs in 2025, which hit the single most important metric in the turnaround story, which is gross margins. margins fell to 27.5% in Q2, down 170 basis points year-on-year, with 3% of that tied directly to tariff pressure. Those two numbers were all the market needed to write off this quarter as an ugly one. But when you actually do the work under the surface, it is nowhere near as bad as Mr. Market's knee-jerk reaction would suggest. That $800 million doomsday figure excludes any mitigation actions. Excludes any mitigation actions which are already well underway. management implemented an initial price increase back in April with demand remaining consistent post increase and another modest increase is planned for early Q4. They're also working to improve USMCA compliance where possible and plan to reduce their China manufacturing footprint to under 5% by the end of 2026. These steps are expected to reduce the actual tariff impact to just 60 to 65% of the 800 million. For those of you not good with math, that's about $300 million less. Most importantly, management expects pricing and mitigation to largely offset the entire tariff headwind by 2026. Again, most importantly, management expects pricing and mitigation to largely offset the entire tariff headwind by 2026, not 2029, 2026. That sets up Q2 gross margins as an inflection point for the year. Both Q3 and Q4 are expected to show 152 north of 200 basis points of year-over-year margin expansion with Q4 margins landing in the 34 33 to 34% range. That puts Stanley Black & Decker just a hair shy of its long-term target above 35%. A level management expects to reach in the second half of 2026. Not 2036. 2026. Keep in mind, the last time this business had gross margins above 35%, it generated $85 in EPS and traded north of $150 a share. It's in the 60s right now, ladies and gentlemen. And by the way, none of this recovery depends on volume. This is pure cost-driven margin improvement. No market rebound, no operating leverage, just execution. But when the market does turn, and it's inevitable, Stanley Black & Decker will be a cash machine. Tariffs don't change the multi-million dollar using unit housing shortage caused by a decade plus of underbuilding. They don't change demographics with over 70 million millennials entering prime family formation for years. And they don't change this administration's laser focus on cutting red tape and improving housing. Ladies and gentlemen, when rates come down and housing wakes up from the dead, it will suddenly become the new shiny object of the object trade of the market. And this beach ball that has been held underwater will explode higher. We skate to where the puck is going, not to where it's already been. It is only a matter of time.",

      "earnings growth was about 14% for MAG7 that has reported but that's down from 33% earnings growth last year and next quarter will be the first quarter that earnings growth for MAG 7 actually goes below 10% but the multiples haven't contracted so if you look at Amazon uh 31 times PE uh you know with with low double digits earnings growth you look at Microsoft 30 31% uh 31 times PE with 8% earnings growth so you're seeing the earnings growth compress as they spend more and more on capex. We're waiting for that return on on investments, but the multiples haven't contracted yet. So, I do think with the weight of the MAG 7 and the S&P 500, you're going to continue to see some international outperformance in the back half of the year. The other thing that we've seen in the last month, month and a half, has been two themes. smaller and high short entrance has uh short interest has outperformed the S&P 500 by 11 full percentage points in the last 67 weeks and I think that's going to continue and the reason is is all dips have to be bought. So many managers sold in the hole over a trillion dollar of equity selling in the beginning part of April and they haven't caught up to their indices. So they've got to chase that performance and they can't chase what's already up a lot. they've got to buy those things that haven't yet moved and those are largely smaller stocks uh which are which are the most shorted right now. And if you look at earnings growth for next year, small cap earnings growth is going to be 37% versus the S&P 500 earnings growth expected to be about 14%.

      "with the highlights here um with Baxter in particular because uh that is in the opportunity zone at the moment. Baxter, our sleepy medical device pick, reported what we would call a textbook definition of a kitchen sink quarter last week. take all the medicine at once and set the stage for new CEO Andrew Haidider to walk in like a hero, suddenly having the mightest touch for a business that has gone nowhere but down for years. There were two shots of medicine in the Q2 report that spooked the market and led to a fullear guidance cut. First, management voluntarily paused shipments and installations of its Noam IQ infusion platform to work with customers and address feedback. Noam was Baxter's shiny new product with strong backlog already taking nearly two points of market share annually and a key driver behind the 6% growth in the MPT segment last quarter. Second, hospital IV fluid conservation efforts have lingered longer than expected following hurricane Helen and the North Cove recovery, delaying a return to historical norms. Combined, these overhangs led management to lower full f fullyear sales guidance from four to 5% growth to 3 to 4% growth and trim EPS guidance from a range of 247 to 255 down to 245 to 252. So basically, you know, 252 down to 247, the stock sells off 30%. That for me is opportunity of the a lifetime. Okay, so we've been stuffing as much as we could. Same with VFC Corp. Same with Intel. No change in any of those. And National Oil Well Varco. By the way, uh in markets, Mr. Market's eyes, that was enough to knock the stock down over 20%. You can't make this up.

That's not funny, but it's funny that the multiple is that low considering we're dealing with nothing like that at the moment. A move back towards sector average and Baxter's own historical 16 to 17 times multiple feels inevitable once the dust settles. Until then, we sit on our hands, collect the dividend, and simply let the story play out. Sooner or later, boring will be beautiful and Baxter wins that prize all day long."
