**Tom's Current Market Conviction: Bullish → 8/10** 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥☆☆

- Too many managers are behind the benchmark and every dip of 3 to 5% will be bought.
- Earnings growth estimates for the year have gone up.
- Market is sniffing out more dovish policy.

## Macro Thesis & Key Data Points
The market is in a secular bull market, with a demographic underpinning that supports above-trend growth and spending. While short-term consolidation and volatility are expected, any pullbacks should be bought. The Fed is likely to cut rates, which will further boost the economy. The US dollar is expected to weaken, benefiting international and US earnings.

| Indicator | Value | Tom's Interpretation |
|-----------|-------|----------------------|
| Jobs Revisions | Largest overall revision in 50 years | Acknowledges the labor market is weaker than anticipated, putting the Fed's dual mandate back on the table and increasing the odds of a September rate cut. |
| Interest Rates on Government Debt | Consuming 17% of government spending | Keeping rates artificially high can become inflationary itself, necessitating rate cuts. |
| US Consumer Confidence | Lowest since 2009 and 2011 lows | These are times when it pays to be a buyer, not a seller. Markets don't have secular tops when consumer confidence is this low. |
