# Hedge Fund Tips with Tom Hayes – Episode Various
### Week Ending November 26, 2025

**Executive Summary**
> Tom Hayes expresses caution about the frothy AI market, highlighting extreme retail call buying, high bullish sentiment, and active managers' full equity exposure. He suggests focusing on reasonably valued stocks outside the AI hype, particularly in small and mid-caps. He favors playing the AI revolution with less expensive stocks like Alibaba and Intel, and identifies opportunities in energy (Comstock Resources) and data center infrastructure (Generac). He also emphasizes the importance of value investing and free cash flow generation, drawing parallels to Warren Buffett's approach and historical market cycles.

**Tom's Current Market Conviction: Cautiously Optimistic, expecting a 6-9% pullback before year-end strength. → 6/10** 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥☆☆☆☆

- Retail sentiment is super high.
- Active managers are at 100% equity exposure.
- Breadth is weakening with a spike in 52-week lows.

| S&P 500 Forward PE | Above 23 | Highest since 2000, indicating stretched valuations. |
