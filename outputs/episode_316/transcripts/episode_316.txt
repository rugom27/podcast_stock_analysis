Um uh that's with uh Ashley over at the New York Stock Exchange. There are my buddies uh Lou Bassines and Kenny Pulcari, who you know very well. We got to meet up. That's uh right across from where I am at Bryant Park. And what else do we have here? Uh we got Yahoo with Ali Canal and Brooke De Palama. That was a lot of fun. Uh and I think that is the story. So also want to remind you I will be in Sarasota, Florida on December 1st through the 3rd at the Ritz Carlton uh for the money show.

I want to thank Liz Clayman and Brooke Haliscak for having me on Fox Business yesterday. Exciting segment. We'll listen in here. Let's get right to the floor show. Joining me now, Grey Hill Capital Chairman Thomas Hayes. Uh nice bounceback today at 30,000 ft. Yeah, I think I'm going to throw a little bit of a wet blanket on today's move, which is unusual for you. Yeah, I've been accused of being a perma bull, but we have to be fearful when others are greedy. You know, we've seen a record call buying among retail investors for the last 25 consecutive weeks. This is the biggest streak since 2020. It usually doesn't end well. Bullish uh sentiment. AI had bullish sentiment 44%. That's very, very high. National Association of Active Investment Managers, they had equity exposure of 35% at the lows in April. They're now at 100%. So, I'm not calling for any type of major correction. I don't think the hiccup yesterday is over. Usually the secondary corrections after you have a 15% plus correction that makes all-time highs, the secondary average is about 6%. I think we've got a little more to go with. And look at the Russell up 44 points, nearly 2%. This is a beautiful move for the small and midcaps. Is that a place that you're looking? I love small and midcaps. They've been outperforming since the summer, since July and August. Small caps have outperformed large caps. No one's paying attention to that. And I think outside some of these frothy pockets that everyone is chasing, you could effectively throw a dart at a board, Liz, and find a reasonably valued stock. So, it's a tale of two cities. You have this frothy pocket, which Michael Bur walked the world up to yesterday. Okay. Michael Bur is a short seller famous for the big short. He made billions during the subprime crisis. Yeah. And I think his action buying puts on 5 million shares of Palanteer kind of the activity walk us up to he did what many investors were thinking thinking that this area is a little bit overvalued. Can I just say though Andrew Left of Citroen Research was here a month plus ago and he said I love Palunteer. This valuation is crazy. Well, here's the thing. They shorted it first. Yeah. Look, you Michael Bry has a track record of making billions on shorts, so people pay attention because he's managed he's managing money, right? So, you know, you've got a business that's trading at, uh, there was a report out on Monday from Wed Bush saying it's going to be a trillion dollar company. They did a billion dollars of revenue, not profits. 4 billion, that's 250 times sales. That's crazy town. Palunteer is a great business. They're doing great things, but you're paying for too many years of perfect execution upfront. What about the argument that the Nvidas of the world, the Googles, the Microsofts who are and Oracles that are doing so much of this spending? Yeah, they have great cash flow. What about that argument that they are solid? They do make profits and they have the money to do this. I agree. But price is what you pay. Value is what you get. They're actually spending 60% of operating cash flow on capex right now. There's only one other sector in the market that's spending that much on capex. You know what that is? It's called big oil. So now these tech companies that had big valuations because they were capex light, they now still have high valuations, but their capex is so on the screen. Tell us what we're seeing here. 12 month free cash flow for Amazon, Google, Meta, Microsoft, and it's going down. Yeah. 43% from Q4 of 2024 to Q1 of 2026 because of all the spending. And what investors are saying and what they started to say in mass yesterday is we want to see a return on that invested capital. They're not going to see that for the next year and a half to two years. So we're going to have hiccups like these in this little frothy area. Do we sell our Nvidia shares? Do we sell our Oracle shares? I think we play AI because this is an early inning theme. We believe in the AI revolution, but you play it with less expensive stocks that can benefit such as such as Alibaba. You know, we've been in this forever. We couldn't give it away under 100. Now everyone's starting to want it at 160. It can go a lot higher over time. That's the cheapest AI play in the world right now. By the way, you get the e-commerce business and the cloud business for free. Intel, the success of Nvidia, AMD, ARM holdings, all of the designers is dependent upon supply. They have all the demand in the world. They have a bottleneck of supply with Taiwan Semiconductor. The government has now stood behind Intel. They're going to be supplying to all of these designers. Let's just be clear. When you say supply, you mean actually manufacturing the chips that Nvidia and the world design. Correct. So, Intel is a cheap way to play the AI revolution. Then you have energy. We've got to power it. You got Commtock Resources, which is the lowest cost natural gas producer in the Hannesville shale. Jerry Jones owns 71% of that stock. And then finally, the backdoor way to play AI is the data center growth is going to be backstopped by GenerRack. They've got a $300 million backlog on data center backup generators. I never think of them as a data center play. I think of them as a hurricane and and utility play. And here's the beauty. The stock is down a little bit right now because they had a weak hurricane season. They have 75% of the home standby generators. What people don't realize is that backlo is going to a half a billion dollars by next year just on data centers alone. Fascinating stuff. Tom, stop being so smart. I learned from you. Good to see you and good answer. All right, President Trump expected to and we're back and the day before I spent the whole hour with Stuart Vney. Thank you to Payton Jennings. Uh we condensed it down. Uh we're going to listen in here quite a Dow off 290 almost 300 points. The NASDAQ down 400 as we speak. Tom Hayes joins me to talk about this. Look, it it is a sell-off. Is it all about Palunteer or is there a larger question about AI here? I think both. Uh we want to be fearful when others are greedy. People are over their skis. Retail sentiment is super high. And we saw last night Michael Bur who's famous for calling bubbles, the housing bubble in particular, bought puts on 5 million shares of Palunteer and 1 million shares of Nvidia. So he's saying this AI pocket is a little overvalued. We tend to agree with this. There was a note out yesterday on Palunteer projecting a $1 trillion valuation. Well, they did about a billion dollars in revenue, which four quarters a year, 4 billion. That's 250 times forward sales. So, look, Palanteer is doing a lot of great things. They're going to continue to do a lot of great things. The question is, how much are we already paying for? 10 years worth of good things, 15 years of good things. And it reminds me a lot of Amazon in 2000. Everything they promised they were going to do they did except for the fact you were paying for it in 2000 and the stock subsequently went down 80% even while their revenues cash flow and earnings were improving for the next four years and sooner or later they grew into that valuation but uh some of these valuations are a little bit aggressive in this small that's why people talk about a bubble yeah and valuation just so up there and and Stu not to be bearish outside of AI you could throw a dart at a board and find a reasonably ly valued stock. But in this particular pocket, there is a little bit of froth and uh you should go about it with some care. Just for the sake of clarity, you buy a put and you're expecting the stock to go down. To go down. That's correct. 5 million puts on pant Palanteer. Yeah. Big issue. Got it. Big bet. Stay with me for the hour, please. Last question. That's a big dip in Palanteer. Would you buy that dip? No. Thank you. The chipm Oh, this is now this is really important. The chipper AMD, they report after the bell today. This is a very big deal. Walking up the numbers, they're down 10 bucks, 4%. AMD, it's a dip. You're buying it. Be careful with this trade right now. St. Pass for now. Thank you. That's a dip. Yeah. Buying it. Not here. Help me out. I Price is what you pay. Value is what you get. We're going to talk about some cheaper stocks in a second. It's a deal. Dip. Buy it. Buy it. Three times earnings, six times yield. They're coming off the mat. I like Fizer. I like healthcare trading at the lowest relative valuation to the S&P in 25 years. Generational opportunity. Only eight times earnings onward. That's it. Yeah. Cheap 6% yield while you wait. Not going anywhere. They've got a weight loss play. They've got they've got a pipeline. You could sleep like a baby at night. Sue, I do. Anyway, what do you think it takes to be rich in terms of income in America today? What do you got? Rich. Yes. Rich. Not wealth. Income. Income. 750 to 1.25 million. Okay. Uh it's that time when Tom Hayes is with us and he gives us his stock picks. And the first one is Intel which is down 4% this morning. Yes. So the AI revolution is real but we can play it responsibly. Price is what you pay value what you get. Margin of safety. And Intel we gave it on your show 1819 bucks went up to 40 down a little bit. It's going to consolidate those big gains, but over the long term, for Nvidia to succeed, for AMD to succeed, for all the designers to succeed, Intel needs to succeed because they need supply. They've got the demand. They're limited with supply with Taiwan Semiconductor. Intel is going to fill that gap. Quickly on one of my favorites, GenerRack, the the uh makers. So, they were down a little bit on earnings because of uh hurricane season was weak. They have data center backup generator demand as far as the eye can see. This is a great backdoor way to play AI data centers. Got it. Tom, thank you very much indeed. Before we leave you, Tom, uh, if Manny wins, what impact on Wall Street and stock prices? Nothing for more than a day. Maybe there'll be a little weakness for a day, but it's not going to impact earnings in the long term and earnings drive stock prices. Got it. Thank you. with a proposal that would give revenue to the state's Medicaid program. And here in New York, well, Mumani wants to put a search charge on millionaires. California, that's not a tax, that is confiscation. Yeah, that's exactly what they just taken it. Just taking it. Okay. Um Thomas is still with me. We had a conversation during the commercial break. You told me that the big money is leaving New York and London and going to Florida and Abu Dhabi. Yeah, no question, Stuart. the money goes where it's treated best and the center of the financial world used to be New York and London. It's moving to Miami and Dubai and now Dallas. I have a client that's building all of those buildings for Goldman Sachs in Dallas and the backlog is huge. They're booming down in Dallas. Everyone wants the Texas stock exchange. Thanks for being with us today. Still ahead, Senate Armed Services. And we're back. And then I had the privilege of joining the Big Money Show also for the hour on Monday. Want to thank Madison Myrtto for having me on. We'll listen in here. Welcome to the Big Money Show. I'm Degan McDow and a big welcome back to Taylor Rig. Thanks everyone. Love you all. And also here my co-hosts David Asmin, Jackie D'Angelus, and with us for this hour, Great Hill Capital Chairman Thomas Hayes. I think we need certainty in either direction. So I think actually regardless of how it turns out in the short term, markets can breathe a sigh of relief as they have been. They've been breathing through this whole thing and at least getting big clarity on this big issue. Yeah, I agree with you, Taylor. The big thing though, this is all about the bond market. If we had to hypothetically return $215 billion of revenue, you're going to see yield spike. Part of this is, you know, we ran a surplus, $31 billion collected. We ran a $256 billion surplus in April. That was related to tax also in addition to the tariffs. September, we ran a surplus. So, it's it's showing fiscal responsibility. And we as taxpayers, inflation has been modest. We're getting defense, we're getting infrastructure, we're getting education, we're getting all these things without additional taxes. So, and and that's evidenced by the fact that inflation has been subdued. If this was explicitly a tax on the taxpayer, uh inflation would probably be running 4%, 5%, etc. Plus the compression of the bond yields because we're getting this additional re revenue showing responsibility has brought down financing costs and we're on the cusp potentially before the end of the year of a 30-year fixed rate mortgage below 6%. I think we're at 615 today. Uh and and a lot of this is a function of uh record revenue starting to pour into the Treasury both from growth for deregulatory growth policies and from tariff income. Say that's the case. Um, we talked about the Supreme Court ruling on tariffs and how it could potentially impact markets. You know, this is the financial capital of the world. How does that impact markets if indeed this is what we see? I said earlier, New York will survive and we'll get through it somehow. We always do. Um, but is the stock market going to feel that way? Well, you know, 20 years ago, the centers of the financial world were New York and London. The trend has moved toward seriously Florida and Dubai. Money goes where it's treated best. And if Mani was elected, I think you're going to see that trend exacerbated. You're going to see more jobs in Dallas. You're going to see more jobs in Miami. You're going to see more money flow to Dubai. But the sad thing is the poll, the NBC poll, 44% of Americans are positive on capitalism. Only 25% of Democrats. And 35% of Democrats are positive on socialism. So, on the one hand, if he gets elected, maybe you'll have a case study of why not to do it, and people will wake up because we saw it in the 70s what happened in New York. We saw it with Dinkens in the '90s. Uh, and maybe people need to see see the results before they can change their mind. 80s 80s Denkins. Dinkens 90s was Giuliani. Yeah. 90s he came to speak to Colombia and I fell asleep during the lecture. But uh um you know this is not a positive trend as it relates to the stock market. I think it will be a blip. I think that the decision on tariffs is going to be the the critical decision this week with regard to the bond market. And as Dan said before about interest payments too, remember Powell has been 150 basis points too restrictive. So as that continues to come down, our interest servicing on the short end is going to come down. They've been refinancing a lot on the short end of the curve. Uh but the fiscal responsibility on the long end of the curve is what we want and we're getting that from tariffs and we're getting that from record taxes due to growth and deregulatory policies. Atlanta GDP now estimates for this quarter is 3.9% GDP growth. that brings in a lot of tax revenue cuz people are making money. You bring up a good point. I'm also So the question is, has Warren Buffett changed or has Wall Street? Tom, I want to come to you on this because growing up truly it was the Oracle of Omaha. You would read those shareholder letters. You would try to get a seat in that in in that building, right? Just to try to hear anything he would say. Yeah. Because we've pivoted to this world that appears to be going to AI. Yeah. Is that company just not able to keep up with the times or should I not bet against Warren Buffett? You never want to bet against Warren Buffett. This reminds me of the year 2000. They had all the covers has Warren Buffett lost his touch when you had the tech boom and he was buying CocaCola and Proctor and Gamble. You couldn't give away those stocks. And over the next four years as the NASDAQ fell 80%, Warren Buffett dramatically outperformed. He had some of his best four years in history while everyone else else was losing their shirts. I would say um two things. Number one, he's built up 380 billion of cash. I think there's an element he wants to go out like Seinfeld at the top. And he is the greatest of all time since inception. He's compounded money at just under 20% per year relative to the S&P at 10%. And what does that mean in English? 5.5 million% return versus 39,000% return for the S&P 500. So never bet against Warren Buffett. However, uh I don't think the premium will be justified moving forward. Uh what's going to happen for the next year is uh he'll he'll you know at at some you know he'll step away. There will be pressure after he's gone uh to break up the company for the sum of the parts are greater than the whole. Uh most conglomerates trade at a discount. Buffett trades as at a premium. The culture will be his son will hold the culture in place for two years and eventually the pressure will grow. So, I think shortterm when he's no longer involved, uh, there might be a headwind on it. I think long-term they will start to pound the table for dividends. They will start to pound the table for breakups. And when people do the sum of the parts, they'll say, "This this is pretty valuable." And maybe you get a little little of that premium back. That's what I love about there's some things that AI simply cannot do. And Warren Buffett is an example of that. Yeah. In English, all that means for the lay person is if you put your money in the S&P, it doubled every seven and a half years. If you put your money with Warren Buffett, it doubled every three and a half years. That's a big big deal. And you know the penny thing in the lake, it it compounds very very quickly. If you put your money in Palunteer this year, you more than doubled your money. You guys, this is a stock. It's up 165% this year alone. It's up an additional two. I remember this was like an $11 stock, right? It is a $25 stock. It's incredible. the reporting um earnings after the bell today. Tom, quick thoughts. They're looking at what could be a billion dollars in revenue. People have said, "Look, valuation is a concern. I was looking by some measures, you're looking at 200, 400 times PE." Mind-blowing numbers. Wedbush though upgrades this to a $230 stock, saying this is a trillion dollar business. Your thoughts? I don't know. You know, a billion times four is four billion. Is that worth a trillion? You know, that's topline, not even profit. So, is is it worth 250 times sales? Right now, the market says it is. Uh, but you know, here's the thing about these situations. This can go on a long time. It can be worth two trillion. But at the end of the day, the the value of a stock is the sum of the future cash flows discounted back to today. So, if I'm paying 200 time sales and they miss by 1%, the stock is not going to go down 1%. The stock's going to go down 50%. So, rule number one of Warren Buffett was don't lose money. Rule number two is don't forget rule number one. When you're buying a stock that's trading at 100 or 200 times sales, you are taking a gamble that can continue for a long time. But how do you when the tide goes out, you see who's swimming naked. So, uh I would just say uh if you want to be in this and ride the momentum, size it proportionate to the amount of risk. It can keep going, but when it stops and the music is over, you better find a chair. The AI infrastructure buildout is moving quickly and Nvidia is selling shovels in the gold rush. Remember that expression, which I love. One of my favorites, Thomas. But it's now up uh right now about almost 4% 3.75%. Are you buying? I'm not a buyer at these levels. Uh I will say, listen, one of the best performing AI stocks of the year is Intel. And the reason is is Nvidia relies on the kindness of strangers. Nvidia is a chip designer, one of the best in the world, obviously, or the best in the world. Uh, I like the fact that they're selling to UAE. I want them to sell to more countries. I was a little hesitant with the withhold from China. I understand the national security cuz we want to keep all these countries dependent on a US producer, not independent. If we don't give it to them, what do they have to do? They have to create it on their own. They have to China. Well, China doesn't have to create it on. They they steal what we have. That's that's why we're trying to keep it away from them. But but you think there's a symmetry between Intel and Nvidia that's that's perfect in Nvidia designs and and Intel makes that's correct because they were fully dependent on the kindness of strangers with Taiwan Semiconductor. They were limited to 4 billion revenue growth per quarter. Uh so they they weren't slowed up by demand. They were slowed up by uh by supply. Intel is now going to start to fill some of that supply. So the best thing that can happen to Nvidia is that Intel continues to succeed and the taxpayer is going to make a tremendous amount of money on this investment. They're already up over double and they're probably going to be a five bagger over the next 3 to 5 years which is going to be more. We do own I figured that Taylor there's there's a drill down. Terrific stuff everybody. Thank you Thomas. Thank you. Good having you here for appreciate it. Thomas Hayes and we're back. And then uh also on Monday I had a chance to be on Yahoo Finance with Alli Canal and Brooke Haliscak. Thanks to Taylor Smith, Cloier and congratulations. She's got another baby on the way. We'll listen in here. Welcome to Stocks and Translation, Yahoo Finance's video podcast that cuts through the market mayhem and noisy numbers to give you the information you need to make the right trade for your portfolio. I'm your host Alli Canel in for Jared Blickery and with me is Yahoo Finance senior reporter Brooke De Palma. Today we're diving into 2025 Q3 earnings season, the big wins, those surprising misses, and retail positioning as we head into a crucial season for retailers to hit the mark with their customers. That brings us to our word of the day, which is retail positioning. We'll tell you what that is and why it's so important in today's record high market. And on today's market show and tell, we're talking about the short-term versus long-term market. Our guest describes one as a voting machine based on markets and the other as a weighing machine based on fundamentals. So, what does this mean in practice? And does it really make a difference to know what you own? And our number of the day, 20.8%. That's how much the financial sector share of overall earnings has jumped up from just 11.4% last quarter. So, what is that telling us about the state of the economy and what can it mean for commercial and retail customers going forward? Joining us now to discuss this and so much more is Tom Hayes, chairman and managing member of Great Hill Capital. Tom, welcome to the show and let's start with earnings. We just wrapped up a slew of big tech companies and it was surprising to see Meta and Netflix both miss. So, let's start with your takeaway so far from earning season and those surprise misses. Yeah, I think uh earnings have been better than expected. Estimates coming into the quarter were up 8%. It's been up 10.7% with 64% of the companies reporting uh 83% beat on the bottom line, 79% on the top line. So overall good. Financials was the largest contributor to that earnings growth and surprisingly uh communication services was the biggest detractor and the biggest two detractors in that that area uh were Netflix and Meta. And I think the the issue with meta is a theme that we have to pay close attention to which is the amount of capex spending that we're seeing uh by these hyperscalers. As a matter of fact, they're now spending as a in an aggregate group uh 63 60% of operating cash flow to capex. What does that mean in English? uh it means they're spending the same amount of money as the large oil companies are now spending in capex and if you look at the multiples of oil companies relative to the multiples of the mag 7 there's a huge divergence so uh we do have to keep an eye on that because at some point the market's going to say we need to see a return on all that investment and for meta the market said that this quarter for some of the others it may be in coming quarters uh especially as we see in the last 12 months from Q4 2024 to Q1 of 2026, we're going to see their free cash flow drop by 43% because they're investing so much. And keeping on that same theme, we did hear from so many folks that they're comparing this meta- spend to what we saw on their metaverse spending back in 2021, 2022. Investors not too happy about that. So, what do you make of that? Well, eventually remind you as well. Yeah, it certainly does. Eventually uh they cried uncle and they pivoted and they stopped the spending and the stock went back up. I don't think we're at that point yet. I think they are investing. I think a lot of this is certain it feels like offensive spending but I think there's a lot of defensive spending. They don't want to give their competitors an edge and they want to invest invest invest and hope for those returns down the line. Uh but uh so far the returns are not there. The cash flows are declining and the market is saying okay we're going to give you a little bit more time. we're going to give you a little more time unless the spending is outsized. In the case of uh Meta and in the case of Netflix, we saw uh some margin compression and and we are seeing seeing that in certain uh pockets of the market. I do want to get to our phrase of the day. It is retail positioning. Tom, can you start by breaking down what exactly retail positioning is and why it's so important for retailers to keep a close eye on this as they round out Q4? Yeah, so when when we talk about retail position, we're talking about retail investors positioning. So, this is usually a contraindicator in terms of sentiment. Uh, a couple things we're seeing. We're seeing the longest streak of call buying by retail investors since 2020. Okay. So, there's super duper bullish. Super duper bullish. Uh, and most of those expire in November. So, it wouldn't surprise me because who sells the options to retail is the dealers, the big banks. Uh, it wouldn't be surpris worthless. What would have to happen for that to happen is the market kind of chops and grinds sideways a little bit of volatility before kind of the final end ofear push. Uh then you look at a ai bullish sentiment for retail investor positioning at 44% bullish. That's the highest in months. Uh you know a a number of these streaks are feeling a little bit frothy. If you look at the um uh S&P multiple at 23 times earnings compared to the 10-year average of 18.6 times. everything has to continue to go perfectly right or these retail investors that have been really getting aggressive in the last few months uh might see more subdued returns in the foreseeable in the near-term future. Do you think we're at a moment where there's so much spending when it comes to AI? And we talk all the time about whether or not we're in a market bubble or not, if this is similar to what we saw at the dot boom and bust. But are we fundamentally different today? And is this maybe a shift in what justifies a high valuation versus a normal valuation? Maybe 23 times forward earnings is the new norm. Yeah, it it could be because the the thesis with that is is that tech companies, software companies have always been capex light. So now we're going back to capex heavy. And uh are we in a bubble today? No. I I do think we're in the early stages of this process. But if you remember in the 90s there were a lot of shakeouts along the way. It would get a little bit frothy, then earnings would catch up and would get a little more frothy. So I do think in the near term we might see some consolidation, meaning prices might just have to go sideways. maybe they pull back a little bit just to absorb all the gains that we've had in a relatively short period of time, kind of get that multiple uh a little bit more normalized. But the trend is going to be significant and I think the way to think about return on invested capital is going to be are companies benefiting from this technology because right now it's pretty circular. You buy my chips, you put it in your cloud, you you sell it to companies. But companies need to see margins expand as a result of buying these services from the providers in order for this to be sustainable long term and I think we'll see that. I just think it's going to be a little bit further down the road and the market's going to have a little doubt along the way. Tom, what do you make of all these companies? It's so circular. We're seeing that as you just said, but really with Open AI, even today Amazon made an announcement with Open AI. It just seems like the focus is so on this one company which it might go public next year. Yeah, I think you know interesting thing you saw in terms of financing this capex Oracle's CDS spread the cost to ensure their debt is at two-year highs. So the equity market is not sniffing it out yet. But the bond market to a lesser extent is starting to say I wonder if this is sustainable. Where are the returns? because we're the we're the debt. Uh it's like uh President Clinton once said he wanted to wake up one day as the bond market because the bond market controls everything. When you see Oracle's debt getting a little bit uh uncomfortable of the cost to insure going up, you say, "Okay, the market is taking note here. Let's start to see a return on all this investment in the soon nearer term." And if they don't see it, that's where we could get some chop in those pockets. But outside the hyperscalers, outside the mag 7, literally you could throw a dart and find a company that's reasonably valued under the surface. And these are going to be all the beneficiaries of AI years down the road as their margins expand by implementing these technologies into their businesses. And that brings us to our market show and tell. And today we're talking about the short-term versus long-term market. And Tom, you described the short-term market as a voting machine based on emotions and the long-term market as a weighing machine based on fundamentals. So can you break that down a little bit further to us for us and how that kind of leads into your thesis of know what you own? Yeah, I I think this is a critical lesson for people and it comes from Ben Graham which was uh Warren Buffett's mentor. He wrote the intelligent investor. Uh a great example of this if you remember just a year a year and a half ago company called Alibaba and if you remember the narrative was China is uninvestable. you can't buy Chinese stocks because of the communist government, because of all the different things. But we looked at it objectively and we said, uh, they've got $80 billion of cash on the balance sheet. They're generating $25 billion a year of free cash flow. They're not going anywhere. They were trading at a high singledigit PE multiple. Oh, and by the way, it was the cheapest AI play in the world. their Quen uh large language model has proven now to be faster than chat GPT and more effective on several different metrics. Uh and sure enough uh right after all the uninvestable articles and all the downgrades in the hole at $60, the stock took off. It's now 160 170 bucks probably going back to 300 over the next few years. Um so that's been one of the largest AI performers best outperformance this year. No one's talking about it. What's another one one of the top AI performing stocks this year? You guys aren't going to believe this is Intel. Okay, it's gotten all these investments even from the government. Just about everyone wants to get in. That's such a turn from what we here here's the thing. So So Intel was uninvestable as well. So we did analysis uh it was trading at a discount to book. So in other words, book value was about $22 a share. It was trading at $18 or $19. We said if they liquidate the whole damn thing and it fails, we're going to get back $22. So, our downside is protected and our upside is unlimited. Their legacy CPU business was in which was in the trough of their uh cycle was worth $45 a share. So, we'd have a double if they just stayed in business. Oh, and by the way, they're at the 10th yard line on the FABS in Arizona and they can produce chips. Uh if that works, it could be a five bagger. And sure enough, shortly thereafter, the government stepped in and said, "We need this to succeed for national security. Nvidia needs them to succeed because remember, Nvidia just designs. They don't produce anything. So they are fully dependent on the kindness of strangers aka Taiwan Semiconductor. And Taiwan Semiconductor has capped them at $4 billion a quarter of revenue growth. So their growth is not stymied by demand. Their growth is stymied by supply. So the best thing that could ever happen to Nvidia is that Intel succeeds and can produce chips for them here domestically. Wow. and and and Brook was just mentioning the circular investment and we just continue to see that over and over and clearly there's a lot more to come on that front but we need to take a short break. Coming up we're breaking down a recent change in the financial sector that's next. [Music] It's now time for our number of the day. 20.8% 8%. That's how much the financial sector share of overall earnings has jumped up from just 11.4% last quarter. The financial sector is a major part of the economy that includes companies and institutions involved in money management, investment, and financial services. So Tom, you've been looking at the financial sector closely and it's interesting to see this outperformance considering we've talked a lot about this bifurcated US economy. What's your take given the results that we've seen? Well, what we saw was uh certainly trading revenues were up. So, the volatility was was certainly helpful. Investment banking is up. Uh animal spirits are back. The wealth management business as assets go go up, their fees go up. Uh so, on balance, here's a sector that, you know, no one was really paying attention to a year ago. Uh and you know what's what's really interesting? Most people don't realize because all we're hearing is hyperscalers mag 7 and all this particularly in recent days and weeks. value outperformed growth in Q3. Most people don't know that. Now, that was loaded in August. They outperformed by 700 basis points. Value stocks over growth stocks. Uh but it carried through to the end of the quarter. And I think this is a trend that we're starting to see. Breath has been weak, but it's starting to get better. Uh value uh starting to outperform growth. Small caps have outperformed large caps. No one's talking about that since this summer, since July of this year. Why do you think no one's talking about it? Is it just not sexy to talk about those names? And uh I think it's the weight in the indices right now is so small. It reminds me of energy. If you remember during COVID uh in the spring, energy, oil actually traded negative and they were giving away energy stocks because they said energy is uninvestable. Pensions can't buy it. It's the green revolution, the whole thing. Uh Exxon traded down to $33 a share. We were buying it handoverfist. You have to buy things. Knowing what you own is buying things when they're out of favor. If you're buying things when they're in the headlines, like Palunteer today is going to report. Okay? It could be great. It could be not so great. I have no idea. Chances are it's going to be great. So, they're going to do a billion dollar in revenue. Okay? Billion dollars. Last time I checked, there are four quarters in a year. That's $4 billion in revenue. They're trading at a half a trillion. That's not $4 billion in profits. It's four$4 billion in revenues. Wedbush was out today saying it's going to be go to a trillion dollars. So 250 times sales. A lot has to go perfectly right for that valuation to be realized because what is a stock? It's just at the present value of the future cash flows discounted back. Okay. Uh so a trillion dollars worth of market cap valuation. It it's it's nowhere near that today. So what happens with these type of momo stocks is if they hit and exceed expectations which could certainly be the case tonight it will continue to go up. People won't care about valuation. They will say this is a paradigm shift the moment whether it's a year from now a quarter from now tonight two years from now they miss expectations by 1%. The stock does not go down 1%. The stock goes down 50% because it's like yelling fire in a crowded exit. And Warren Buffett always said, "Rule number one is don't lose money. Rule number two is don't forget rule number one." And when you're playing with paradigm shift and you're investing based on narrative versus earnings power, cash flow, predictability, it's okay as long as you know the game you're in. But if you're buying it just because it's going up and you don't understand that at some point that cash flow has to justify the price, uh when the music stops, you better make sure you have a chair because uh it could be very lonely if you don't. You said a key word in there and you said Momo stock. Momentum stock. Momentum stock. Momentum stock. So, how do you find those diamonds in the rough necessarily like should you be looking at the equal weighted index or how do you find the stocks that maybe are a little bit undervalued or not performing as well because like you said it feels like the attention is on these mag sevens all the time. Yeah. Uh that's a that's a really good question. What we look for at Great Hill Capital is divergences between the underlying fundamentals. So if we can buy a business where the free cash flow is going up every year and the price has come down a lot, we want to find out why is there this divergence? Is it cheap for a reason and it's going to stay cheap like a value trap and it's never going to go up because they've lost share or their technologies outdated or whatever. Uh usually when their cash flow is going up and the price is going down in the short term the market is a voting machine based on emotion. Meaning people are saying, "I can't buy that because the stock keeps going down." Not, "I can't buy that because the free cash flow is going up." In the long term, it becomes a weighing machine. Sooner or later, that stock price is going to catch up to the underlying fundamentals which are improving like we saw with Alibaba, like we saw with Intel, like we saw with Exxon Mobile and others. So, when you can find those, it's not just about getting a stock that goes up. It's about sleeping like a baby at night because you know the underlying business is secure, predictable, has a moat, has a long history, a long track record that you can measure against. Um, and you don't have to worry about them missing 1% because they have free cash flow generation. They're trading at a reasonable multiple. Uh, and uh, sooner or later it catches up. And when they do, they're doubles and triples. They might not be 50 baggers like like like the story stocks, but the 50 baggers quickly turn into 80% downs. for those three stocks that you just mentioned like Alibaba for example is up nearly 100%. There may be some people listening out there who say oh maybe they'll continue this momentum. What would you say for people who are thinking is now still the time to get in? Yeah I well in the case of Alibaba it was so cheap that we we have not sold a share of Alibaba. We do think it's going to go up quite a bit from here over but it's going to take three years. uh this could be a mid-200s low30 stock and depending on how the AI story plays out because they control uh e-commerce they control the cloud business which is in their more nent stages than in the US think Amazon web services of China right uh and you have a lot of outs and they have all these businesses 33% of ant financial largest financial services business in Asia has zero credit in the stock right now and then the AI could be truly unlimited they're galloping you know triple digit growth uh um yearon-year So, uh, that one could double again. Do you have any picks for us? I guess we were just talking about sort of those companies that maybe you can find opportunities in. Do you have anything that you're bullish on right now? Uh, so this one's going to take again three years. One of the ones that cash flow has been near records. Revenues are near re uh records. The stock price is still down 78% is PayPal. You can't give it away. Alex Chris came from in it. He ran the small business division. into it was a a multibagger under his uh leadership at that company. Uh he's come in, he's doing innovative things with Venmo. He's getting the transaction margin up. Uh he's in stable coins, sixth largest issuer of stable coins. He's at the cutting edge. I think he's going to do tremendously. They they kind of troughed in active users now. They're starting to reacelerate. Margins are starting to reacelerate. So this is a company where the stock's down 78% record free cash flow, record revenues. That price when this thing turns, it's going to be aggressive. And what people get sidetracked on and they get sold out of their stock is, you know, they see them report good earnings and the stocks know not going up. It doesn't go up until it does. And then when it happens, it happens all at once. You know, Baba took a year and a half to build a base. Then it just turned. It went from 60 to 180 basically overnight. PayPal will be no different. And people are skeptical. So uh you can't give away that stock right now. Everyone wants to chase uh Nvidia uh chase Nvidia, chase Palunteer, and those might work. You might get an incremental jump, but no one's paying attention to the fact that Intel's stock has outperformed Nvidia this year. And do you think in order to be a successful stock today, you have to just have some sort of relationship with AI? Yeah, for it's it's look, it's the Wall Street fashion show. Okay. Five years ago, it was SAS. If you were if you were software as a service and you had recurring revenues, people would pay exorbitant multiples. Now, you can't give away a software stock. Look at Adobe. They're in the gutter. No one no one will even buy them. They're probably cheap at this point. Um, so for the foreseeable future, you're going to hear the word AI on conference calls. Even if they're making donuts, they're going to say, "We use AI goes up and then the stock goes up." But, uh, but you know, if you've been around through enough cycles, you know, all of that narrative, all that noise, sooner shortterm voting machine, long-term weighing machine, look at what's happening under the surface. And the name of the game is going to be free cash flow because that's all the reason anyone buys a business. The reason you buy, if you're going to buy a local franchise, why do you buy it? Cuz it's generating this much cash today. I think it can generate this much cash tomorrow. Therefore, I'm willing to pay this much. If people bought stocks the way that they would buy a local car wash or a local Jersey Mike's franchise, they would do a lot better over the long term. And we saw it from the GOAT uh from from Warren Buffett uh stepping aside at the end of this year. He outperformed the S&P 19.9% per year versus the S&P 10.4% per year. If you'd invested with him, you made 5.5 million% returns. If you invested in the S&P, you made 39% returns. Uh, which in English for your viewers means you in the S&P, you doubled your money every 7.2 years. With Warren, you doubled your money every 3.5 years. Nearly half. Yeah. Wow. Okay. Buying boring businesses. And by the way, business, that's a takeaway. This was the perfect thing, perfect analogy. In 2000, Warren Buffett was on the cover of multiple magazines saying, "Has Warren Buffett lost his touch? He was underperforming because he had no exposure to the Cisco to all the high-flying sock, the global crossings, all the high-flying stocks of the late 90s. The next few years, as the NASDAQ collapsed 80%, Warren Buffett had his best four years of performance in decades, up 25% while everyone else was was taken out to the woodshed. There you go. If you want to invest like Buffett, sometimes not those sexy names. But Tom Hayes, thank you so much for joining. We are winding things down here at Stocks and Translation, but make sure you check out other episodes of our video podcast on the Yahoo Finance site and mobile app. [Music] And we're back. And then finally, uh got to uh talk with Ashley over at NYSC Live. We had an incredible time as always and thanks to Mel Montana for having me on there. But we begin with the markets as we always do here on NYC Live. Joining me now is our is Tom Hayes. He's the chairman and managing member at Great Hill Capital. Tom, welcome to the show. Thanks, Ashley. Appreciate it. So, Tom, we're almost 30 minutes uh away from the market open. What are you going to be following most closely today during today's session? Well, I think you had the ADP numbers came in a little bit better than expected at 42,000. So, that was kind of positive for the market. people are not seeing the layoffs, the the employment. However, uh that does kind of create some tension for whether the Fed will cut again in December. So, uh I I think you've got that. I think you saw yesterday uh the big news was with Michael Bur buying 5 million puts on Palunteer and 1 million puts on Nvidia. And I think the the shift of thinking framework that happened from that is basically Michael Bur who predicted the housing crisis and and shorted the housing crisis did what everyone else was kind of thinking that certain pockets of the market were overvalued and the air needed to come out of the market. I don't think that correction is over or that pullback rather is over. Uh it's 3% peak to trough. I think we have a little more work to do on that in coming weeks and that will set the stage for a great opportunity in the year end because the more the market comes down the higher the probability the Fed will actually cut in December and as we start to get labor numbers if and when the government opens again uh uh it should set the stage for the Fed to continue the easing cycle. Do you think the Fed's going to cut in December? What's your prediction? Uh I do think so. I think we're going to see a little more volatility in equity markets. I think as we get the employment data, they're it's going to show some pockets of weakness, and that will then uh set the stage for kind of some year-end strength after a little bit of short-term weakness. And looking into 2026, uh what do you see the Fed doing there? I think they'll be continuing in the direction of easing, but at a slower pace. You know, right now, uh, the positives on the market, even though in short term, I I see a little choppiness. You have record liquidity, 313 interest rate cuts this year globally. Okay, that's the highest level of cuts since 2010, since the great financial crisis. So, it's very hard to get too bearish, which is why we've been looking for a 5 7% pullback uh and then kind of finish the year strong. Um, uh, earnings have been very, very good. We're going to grow earnings at 13% uh next year. Uh this quarter's earnings have been good. 83% beat rate on the bottom line with 64% reporting 79% on the top line. But we did come into this month with, you know, retail investors buying record call options, the longest streak since 2020, 25 weeks in a row. Uh bullish sentiment at 44% for AI sentiment survey. uh S&P 500 streak above the 50-day moving average uh 126 127 sessions. Uh last few times that happened, you you did get corrections. So uh and finally, the most concerning thing is breath weakening. So we had a a spike in 52- week lows. That's not not the sign of a healthy market. The highest number of 52- week lows since April. And you know what happened in April. So, um we're cautiously optimistic. We had built up a little bit of cash in April. Not a lot, but uh off of all margin, uh a few percentage uh points of cash, and we're hoping to deploy that in coming weeks as we get a little bit uh a little bit of weakness. And of course, you mentioned earnings. Uh we are in full swing Q3 earnings season. What are your takeaways so far? Any surprises and what are your expectations? Yeah, so far uh the biggest contributor has been financials which no one would have expected and the biggest detractor has been communication services namely uh Meta had had a big impact on that detraction. Uh Netflix margin contraction. So we're we're kind of seeing an environment where uh capex is be starting to be questioned. Uh and and I think what's really interesting about that, Ashley, the percentage of uh uh operating cash flow that hyperscalers are spending on capex is now up to 60%. Do you know what other industry has capex rates that high? No. Big oil. So if you recall, historically these businesses have gotten expanded multiples, high multiples. Why? Cuz they said they're capex light. These are just cash machines. They don't have to make huge investment. Well, now 60% of operating cash flow is a huge investment. They still have high multiples. And I think Bur kind of was a wakeup call for the market yesterday and people saying we want to see a return on invested capital. And I don't think we're going to start to see that. We will see it, but it's going to take one and a half, two, two and a half years. In the meantime, all this cash is going out the door. So, I think you could see a rerating in those 7 to 10 stocks that are a little bit aggressively valued. Aside from that, you could literally throw a dart at the board and find a reasonably valued stock. So, outside of those 10 stocks, there is a lot of great companies trading at reasonable valuations that you can put money to work. What other sectors are you looking at? Well, we uh we we have across sectors, you know, GXO Logistics reported today. So, that they do uh logistics services uh um predominantly in Europe. That's one of Brad Jacobs companies. But we're trying to play the AI play with reasonably valued stocks. So, one that we've had for a while is Alibaba. They're the cheapest AI play in the world. Yes, they're up a lot from where we bought it. It's gone from 60% $60 lows to 160 and change. We think they can double again over the next three three plus years. Uh Intel when no one wanted it at $1819. All of these designers, Nvidia, AMD, etc., they were at the mercy of Taiwan semiconductor capacity. They need Intel succeed. the government has stood behind them. Intel will succeed. They've had a big run. They're going to consolidate the gains for a little bit and then move higher as they get the advanced chips in production. And then uh uh Comtock Resources is cheapest natural gas play. Uh Jerry Jones owns it. Hannesville Shell. That's going to power the data center boom. And then finally is Generrack. They do the standby generators. They have a $300 million backlog for data center generators. It's a backdoor way to play the AI boom at a reasonable valuation. We have about 30 seconds left. How are you advising investors to approach AI? I think you want to play the beneficiaries over the cost centers. So, everyone's now focused in the cost centers, the ones that are investing the massive amount of money. I think where you want to do it is in the regular unmagnificent 493. They're going to be opportunities that of most companies increasing margins through the implementation of the AI, not the building out of the AI. Uh so look for reasonably valued companies. I think in this chop value has actually outperformed growth in the third quarter. I know everyone's talking about the hyperscalers, but a lot of that was skewed to uh August 700 uh basis points of outperformance. Stay in the value. You don't have to go all the cash. Just buy reasonably valued stocks. Don't get caught up in the shiny objects that everyone's chasing. Tom Hayes, managing member at Great Hill Capital. Thank you so much for joining us at the New York Stock Exchange. Thank you, Ashley. And finally, uh, got to speak with Liz over at CNA, which is the BBC of Asia. Uh, thanks to Maryanne Star In having me on. We'll listen in here. For more, we're joined by Thomas Hayes, who's chairman and managing member at Great Hill Capital. Thomas, thanks for your time this morning. So, just take a look at Wall Street uh, really taking a hit overnight and that was largely driven by weakness in AI related names. How would you characterize I suppose investor sentiment at this point? Well, I think you want to be fearful when others are greedy and there was a lot of froth and a lot of greed coming into this morning, but I do think the catalyst was palunteer. Uh yes, they beat on the top and bottom line. Their their guidance for next year was a bit hazy. And then we saw the 13F filing from Michael Bur who's famous from the big short uh taking out puts on five million shares of Palunteer and 1 million shares of Nvidia. So what's been on people's minds they saw other actors in the market starting to take action on and people started to think about. You know yesterday before Palunteer reported there was a report out estimating uh projecting that Palunteer should be a trillion dollar company. Well, they did a billion dollars in revenue last quarter. So four times that is 4 billion. That's 250 times sales is what that report was projecting. They they're tra trading at 250 times forward earnings. So it's not to say Palanteer is a great company. They're doing great things. They're going to continue to do great things. The question is price is what you pay, value is what you get. And I think investors are starting to take inventory when you see the amount of capex that these hyperscalers are spending, which is now approaching 60% of operating cash flow going into capex. The only other industry that high is big oil. Mhm. Well, Thomas, I'm also wondering if the comments by executives from Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley are also contributing to the market jitters because they've been warning about the potential for a 10 to 20% uh market draw down in equity markets. I mean, are they ripe for a correction, you think? And what does this mean for the bull market, which has been pretty resilient so far, especially since April? I think the S&P 500's forward PE uh ratio is now above 23, which would mean that is the highest since uh 2000. So really, how concerning is all of this for you? Yeah, we're ripe for a pullback. We are not ripe for a correction. uh on years where you have a correction of 15% or more and then you reach all-time highs, the secondary pullback usually averages over the last 40 or so years, 6.4% between 3% and 9%. So I think we're more than due for that. But you got to look at the backdrop. Global liquidity is at a a multi-year high over 33 uh central bank cuts around the world. the highest since 2010. So, there's a lot of liquidity. Earnings have been good. Earnings are going to be up 13% next year. So, when yes, should we pull back 6 to9%? You bet. Uh uh investor sentiment got frothy. Retail investors were all in. The longest call buying streak, 25 weeks of call buying by retail investors, you know, there was a little froth. That has to get knocked out in the next few weeks. But I think it's more six to nine percent. I think 10 to 20% is a little bit too much and that's a little bit of recency bias based on what happened in April and unlikely to happen given Atlanta GDP. Now to your point you were saying the shutdown could take 1 to 2% off of GDP. It's currently tracking at 3.9% for this quarter. So we can afford 1%. And uh I think the market's a little jittery but uh a healthy pullback would be a good thing not a bad thing. Yeah. And so okay the pullback is 6 to 9% or maybe you know the 10 to 20 which seems unlikely in your assessment. Uh how should investors approach it then? Do you see as a buying opportunity or or maybe you know a sign to to derisk portfolios? I think you want to stick to value. As a matter of fact has outperformed growth in Q3. I know a lot of people are just focused on the hyperscalers, but uh the outperformance was largely in August, 700 basis points of outperformance. If you buy great businesses, yes, the AI pocket is a little bit frothy with the hyperscalers margins coming down and the capex going up. But basically outside those seven to 10 stocks, you could throw a dart at a board and find a reasonably valued stock. So there's a lot of great companies to buy. I think if you stick with higher quality, one of our biggest holdings is Alibaba, which is an inexpensive way to play the AI revolution, trading uh uh at mid- teen multiples versus 30 plus times in the US with a lot more upside to be had. We've had that one for a while. Uh Intel is going to have to provide the chips. Everyone's chasing Nvidia. They should be chasing intel because Nvidia's success depends on increased capacity beyond Taiwan semiconductor. that'll be coming from Intel. And then some of the uh oil and gas plays that are going to power this future like Comtock Resources we own is a natural gas play in the Hannesville shale and GenerRack which is doing all the backup generators for the data centers. So there's some covert inexpensive ways to play this revolution which is real but some of these companies are just too overvalued and require too much capex and those are the ones that are getting hit. All right, Thomas, appreciate your time today. Thomas Hazer, chairman and managing member at Great Hill Capital. And we're back. The quotes of the week, Seth Clar, the greatest single edge an investor can have is long-term orientation. We couldn't agree more. And from Buffett, the most important quality for an investor is temperament, not intellect. You need a temper temperament that neither deres great pleasure from being with the crowd or against the crowd. Just the facts. Also want to thank all these incredible supporters uh who are getting the hedge fund tips merch. The name of the game here, why we're growing, why we continue to do this for non-clients is because you guys are doing an incredible job sharing it with your friends and it's growing by word of mouth virally. And the easiest way to do that, like my cousin Leticia, who put on her incredible hedge fund tips hat uh right there, she's one of our newest pictures and a lot of you have started to send in. We've got a bunch of new pictures. So, definitely uh go on and get your picture in at info@hedgefundtips.com. And the best compliment and thank you you can pay us is uh share it with one person you care about. We continue to grow. We'll continue to do this for a very long time. Get your hat. People will ask you. You don't even have to tell them. And you can do that at hedge funips.com. Scroll down. Click on the hat. Get yours. And while you're there, click on terms. This is all opinion, not advice. Consult your f financial advisor before doing anything. Let's get to some data. We got a lot. Buffett on moes. I want to keep you guys grounded in the basic fundamentals. And some of these quotes from Buffett's letters over the years. We refer to as a moat is what other people might call a competitive advantage. It's something that differentiates the company from its nearest competitors either in service or low cost or taste or some other perceived virtue that the product possesses in the mind of the consumer versus the next best alternative. There are various kinds of moes. All economic moes are either widening or narrowing even though you can't see it. That's from 1993. Uh second, look for durability of the franchise. The most important thing to me is figuring out how big a moat there is around the business. What I love, of course, is a big castle and a moat with piranhas and crocodiles like Boeing, like Disney, like many other positions we own. The most important thing is trying to find a business with a wide and lasting mode around it, protecting a terrific economic castle with an honest lord in charge of the castle. That's key, an honest lord, betting on the jockey. Um, a truly great business must have an enduring moat that protects excellent returns on invested capital. The dynamics of capitalism guarantee that competitors will repeatedly assault any business castle that is earning high returns. Our criteria of enduring causes us to rule out companies and industries prone to rapid and continuous change. This is a key concept guys. It's why we stay away from drug companies like uh biotech or we stay away from uh software companies etc. or a lot of tech. We we do do some some tech of course and we were able to benefit AI through Baba and Intel and uh a couple others that we talked about on on our segments. Uh though capitalism's creative destruction is a highly beneficial for society, it precludes investment certainty. A moat that must continually be rebuilt will eventually be no moat at all. Additionally, this criteria eliminates the businesses whose success depends on having a great manager. When our long-term competitive position improves, we describe the phenomenon as a widening the moat and doing that is essential if we are to have the kind of business we want a decade or two from now. We always of course hope to earn more money in the short term but when short-term and long-term conflict widening mo must take precedence. So that's some stuff from Buffett. Uh this was interesting from uh Zenna. It's an $80 billion asset manager. I've met this guy at a charity thing. Um it's interesting. He had a note on Baxter after earnings and uh that stock got hit a little bit. we added uh it says at today's valuation the market is treating these temporary issues as permanent pricing Baxter at only five 5.8 times normalized earnings of $3.92 per share. Uh for long-term investors this pessimism in our opinion creates opportunity. Baxter's franchise centers on essential non-discretionary hospital hospital products where demand is steady scale uh advantages persist and recurring consumables reinforce long-term customer relationships. Hospitals rarely switch suppliers while aging populations and chronic diseases sustain growth. This durability provides a long-term foundation for margins to expand and for earnings to normalize setting up a powerful recovery as temporary pressures fade. We couldn't agree more. No change there and we wrote about it this week. I love this ad from Warren Buffett uh in 1986 in the Wall Street Journal uh looking to buy businesses, advertising to buy businesses. I thought this was an interesting note in Bloomberg. Open AI seeks government backing to boost AI investments. They want the government to back stop their bonds. What what a bunch of criminals. But uh anyway, if you can't take a joke, uh here's another thing from Charlie. Few examples of how we apply Charlie's thinking at Bergkshire. Charlie and I avoid businesses whose futures we can't evaluate, no matter how exciting their products may be. In the past, it required no brilliance for people to foresee the fabulous growth that awaited such industries as autos in 1910, aircraft in 1930, and television sets in 1950. But the future then also included competitive dynamics that would decimate most of the companies entering those industries. Even the survivors tended to come away bleeding. Just because Charlie and I can ear clearly see dramatic growth ahead for an industry does not mean we can ch judge what it its profit margins and returns on capital will be as a host of competitors battle for supremacy. At Berkshire we will stick with businesses whose profit picture for decades to come seems reasonably predictable. Even then we will make plenty of mistakes. Amen. Uh and finally, we will never become dependent on the kindness of strangers. Too big to fail is not a fallback position at Berkshire. Instead, we will always arrange our affairs so that any requirements for cash we may conceivably have will be dwarfed by our own liquidity. Moreover, that liquidity will be constantly refreshed by a gusher of earnings from many diverse businesses. This uh from Northman Trader is showing what we've been talking about about a declining breath uh and uh and our caution on the market uh in coming weeks. We're starting to see that play out in the last few days. We saw it in early October. Then you got a rebound. I think we're going to see a little bit more pullback. I don't think we're going to get to 10% on the indices, but I think six to 6 to9 is is a reasonable place. uh we will deploy the remaining cash that we had raised at the beginning of October over that time period and probably as we get towards the end of the year maybe even to start to have margin on if uh prices get low enough. Not a lot of margin just a little margin but uh when things are on sale we go shopping uh most people run out of the store. Wall Street is the only supermarket where when they hold a clearance sale, people run out versus run in. Walmart holds a clearance sale, people are tackling each other to get in the doors at 5:00 a.m. You can't make this up. S&P 500 versus active equity manager exposure. You could see they were at 35% equity exposure at the bottom. They sold in the hole. They're now at 100%. These are all signs to just be a little more cautious, particularly those pockets that are just in crazy town valuations, which we covered with Liz. Goldman Sachs, lowest level of realized stock correlation since 2017. What followed was 13% correction. Such levels, realized stock correlation, low dispersion have been precursors. Not a condition of future pullbacks. I don't think we're going to get double digit. Um, but that's that worldly wisdom and endurance. This is from Charlie. The game of life isn't about brilliance. It's about avoiding stupidity. You don't need to be a genius to win. You just need to not be dumb for too long. The first rule of inversion, figure out what would ruin you and don't do it. The second is patience. The world rewards those who wait without boredom. As you if you gather enough mental models, physics, psychology, economics, you'll begin to see reality as it is, not as you wish it to be. The best investors aren't gamblers. They are collectors of wisdom. Temperament always beats IQ. Consistency always beats enthusiasm. The ability to stay rational while others lose their heads is the ultimate edge. Success is just discipline multiplied by decades. If there was a clearer theme as to what we've been teaching here for five years, that would be it. That's from Buffett's commencement speech at USC in 1994. Uh percentage of bears in the investor intelligent uh sentiment index moved down to 13.5 below 98% of historical readings. Lowest level since January 2018. What followed next? 10% correction down here for the S&P. So again, all these things are pointing to froth. We talked about the options, we talked about everything else. Uh the cape fear projected annual return based on the cape ratio. Um basically points to emerging value as the highest expected returns for the next 10 years with US large cap uh and uh large growth being the lowest returns. So, emerging value, emerging markets, then small cap, etc. What we've been setting you up for a while. Uh, Michael Bur set the world a fire this week by buying puts on 5 million shares of Palunteer and 1 million shares of Nvidia. He executed what everyone else had been thinking with these charts. he posted on Twitter namely um the circular nature of the financing deals like we saw in the late 90s and some similarities. US tech capex growth is matching the tech bubble of 1999 to 2000. Uh that eventually less than mid- teens of the capacity they built would ever be used. Cloud segment year-on-year growth average growth rates across two key periods. So you can see that it is declining across Amazon, Alphabet and Microsoft. We've covered this for many months. We're now seeing it play out. Stifl Cooper Standard uh reiterates with a buy $41 price target. Their thesis is the same as ours. This was a temporary impairment, not a permanent impairment. You saw the CFO go in and buy 29,000 shares of stock. uh 29 $29,000 worth of stock rather. Um so I don't know what to make of it. I guess it's better than him selling 29,000, but uh either they don't pay him well enough or uh that's not terribly material. Um people got too bulled up. We saw that equity exposure 66% among Bank of America clients all-time high. Um let's get through some of these restaurant subindustry. We continue to look. As a matter of fact, I spoke with the CEO of um Cava yesterday. He was in the green room. He was on claiming right after me. Uh what a super guy. And um you know, so we'll keep our eye on that one for for some time. I like to I liked I looked at the the stock today. They did have a c uh free cash flow positive free cash flow inflection late last year and they've sustained that. So that's a positive thing. Uh valuation is another story, but that that's one I'm keeping an eye on. I had it for lunch today and uh we continue to pay attention to that restaurant sector. Um zero day options volume remains near historical highs. These are all signs that their retail froth needs to get wiped out and you're starting to see it in those momo names. But that said, as I said in the many of the segments is outside the frothy pocket of 10 15 stocks, you could throw a dart and find a reasonably valued stock. And that's what we're slowly uh doing on a daybyday on red days, deploying some of that capital that we had built up. And we'll continue to do that in coming days and weeks. Uh and I think you'll start to see some some uh nice recovery in the first half of next year. Uh S&P 500 sees longest streak above 50-day moving average since 2011. Last few times that happened was uh not uh terribly constructed. Okay, so we got that. Last few times it was um doubledigit correction, but again I think we pulled forward a lot of that 3 plus 20% in the last five years. It's usually every three plus years. So uh leave it at that. AI mentions and earnings calls continue to grow. Uh economy good versus weak labor. So we got weak labor numbers today. We'll discuss those. Um my base case is 6 to9% down from the top in November. Maybe December it trickles on. Uh you know I I've talked about whistling past the graveyard with this 35 days of the shutdown. This is, you know, this is past the level where you get quick bouncebacks. I think if they don't get this thing turned around in the next week, it's going to have some meaningful impact. The good news is there's a lot of cushion with Atlanta GDP now at 4% for the quarter, but the bad news is they need to tie this up. Um, okay, we got uh China stock near lows versus bonds. Huge opportunity there. Oracle five uh fiveyear CDS highest in two years. So all this circular financing, financing for capex without return is now starting to uh get priced in credit markets and um the insurance to ensure those bonds, which is why OpenAI wants a government backs stop. You literally can't make it up. First they tried to be a nonprofit. Uh then they're like, "Oh, wait. We can make money doing this. Let's not be a nonprofit." And now they want the government or aka the taxpayer to backs stop their for-profit financing. Um all right. Well, anyway, uh moving on. US is experiencing a mortgage refinancing boom lit. Okay. So, you know, you get towards that 6% hopefully we'll hit 599 before the end of the year. That was the prediction at the beginning of the year. Uh that would be amazing. and uh year-over-year capex growth. You're seeing this um Meta got hit hard because uh they're not showing returns yet and they're not going to for the next year and a half for two years. So, I think you're going to start to see these names get hit more uh as we had been predicting. Palanteer, same story. Good earnings, but how much are you paying for it? You see the growth rate uh average estimated average EPS growth next four quarters. You know last four quarters Alphabet was 37% next four quarters 5%. Amazon 54% next four quarters 2%. This is from Capital IQ. Uh Apple 31% next four quarters 7%. Meta 37% next four quarters 1% Microsoft 19% next four quarter 16%. So should you really be paying 33 times earnings for that type of earnings growth? And the answer is no. Only other sector that has this large of a capex spend uh as a percentage of operating cash flow at 60% is big oil and we big oil is trading at 15 times not 33 times. Um you can see here the free cash flow uh railroads captured a tiny share of GDP created cost of railroad construction railroad contribution to GDP. This is huge. This was the contribution. This was the benefit. So again cost uh AI beneficiaries not AI cost centers. That is a theme that no one's talking about that we we've been talking about for many months. Hong Kong grows the most since 2023. Transportation stocks ready to break out. That will help. Um Boeing for sure, companies like GXO. Semis added 1 trillion in market cap past 5 days. So I mean these are extreme levels. Household debt to gross disposable income ratio near multi-deade lows. Uh, so the balance sheets are still good, which is why I don't expect a prolonged or a big correction here. Although you're going to start to hear a lot of nervous Nellies who are getting margin calls come on TV over the next few days. Again, a normal 6 to9 pullback should do it. And um, and we'll begin buying that. Risor, China real GDP growth forecast up for the coming decade. Uh that's Goldman Sachs. Here's Magnificent 7 price. Here's Magnificent 7 earnings. You can see the last time you had a divergence this high was uh mid was January this year right before the the correction in MAG 7 mid year. Uh this is diverging again and I think we're going to see uh more pain in those names. change in capex estimates for hyperscalers continues to go up. Their free cash flow is collapsing 43% from Q4 of 2024 to Q1 of next year. Uh so they're going to get derated. Rerate is when the multiple goes up. Date is when the multiple comes down coming to a theater near you. We've been calling for that. It's starting to play out. Uh longest retail weekly option buying streaks on record since 2022. 25 weeks of buying calls, calls concentrated in November. These folks are not going to get paid. So, expect a little more weakness going into option expiration. M&A cycle starting to hit its stride. We had anticipated that. Uh cape ratios, we covered.com darlings 20 to 2019. Home turnover home turnover at lowest rate in decades. Well, I'm trying to change this chart. We just uh moved again. Still in California. We moved 15 minutes down the road uh from Huntington to Newport. So uh so maybe this turnover ratio will go up. Uh global monetary policy stimulus going up. So that's a reason to stay positive. 313 rate cuts this year globally. A lot of liquidity in the system. So after this short term, you know, they, you know, the retail loves to buy these 3% dips. When they turn into six or nine, they're going to puke in the hole and that's probably going to be it. Um, okay. Share of purchase mortgage applications that have adjustable rate. I said ARMS option arms coming to interest only option arms coming to a theater near you. The game is back on and it's just getting started. High quality over high beta. High quality is going to start to take precedence. Um August post August non-farm payroll AI outperforming cyclicals. That just changed. Okay, next. Natural gas futures moving back up. Comtock is back on the run. Um worst performing. Yeah, Lulu. I continue to look at Cava. I think is still a little bit rich but interesting. Chipotle same story. Wendy's no interest. Selony is interesting. Uh average single stock post EPS performance this quarter has been the worst. Uh so the the beats are up 33 basis points. The misses are down 6 and a half. Uh US shutdown cost billions each week. loss to GDP per week is between 10 and 30 billion. US dollar has lots of downside. We agree this is going back to uh well, we've continued to look at the 2000 analog, but go back to the 86 analog and go back to the 74 analog. We agree it kind of hit a triple top here. it's going to continue to work lower which helps international uh S&P returns into year end following greater than 15%. This leaves out the uh secondary correction which averages 6.4% after a correction of 15% or more and reaching all-time highs. Uh you tend to get a pullback which is 6 to9 average 6.4 a markets around the world all-time highs they're now cooling off percentage of stocks that outperform the index. So this is breath uh similar to 2000 uh right before that period and then it just takes off the next year. So I think 2026 is going to be a year where um the equal weight beyond dramatically outperforms the cap weight and um that's going to surprise a lot of people and a lot of these stocks that you can't give away still are going to be doubles pretty quickly. Uh 2025 is unlike any year. Bears are everywhere. Yeah. Not not lately. They've been chasing. Um Palunteer 242 forward ratio. I mean 250 times sales if you look at the projections that were put out on Monday of this week. 125 if you look at current projections. Consumer staples defensives relative to the S&P. We've been talking about this. It's only a matter of time till defensive like people are going to be tripping over themselves to get the Dagios, to get the Baxters, to get the um Hormels of the world. It's just not yet. But when it does, they're going to just quickly double and everyone's going to say, "What happened?" It's going to be like the the Baba move and the Cooper Standard move and people are going to say, "I can't believe that happened." And I'm going to say, "Go back three months ago. I was talking about it and then it went lower right after I said it and now it's doubled." So, rinse and repeat. Tomorrow's newspaper today and that's the story. So, um age of US firsttime home buyers surges to record. Uh okay, so this is the waiting. We've covered that a million times in the last few weeks. This is percentage of stocks within the S&P outperforming the overall index in the last three months. Uh so it's only 26%. This is a time when equal weight, you know, starts to outperform. This, by the way, was when we were buying all of the Amazon and Google we could get our hands on. So, we're on the cusp of something big for the non 10 or 15 stocks that make up the hugest waiting for the unmagnificent 5493 that uh you just start to make money handover fist. We've always done orders of magnitude better than the market when the market does poorly. um or you know underperforms than when the market's up like 30%. Um so uh um we're we're excited. We're excited for sure. Uh Boeing commercial airplane deliveries going up. Second highest relative low since 1957. Again, this points to a little bit of short-term weakness and you just have to be cognizant. Uh I'm a bullish dude, let me tell you. And I'm and I've been telling you for five weeks, just chill. You know, people calling me, why do you have cash in my account? Why don't we have any margin? Chill. Chill. We will get this money to work and then some, but not yet. And now you're seeing starting to see why. Uh, China's MSCI present expands for repeat annual returns. Okay, cattle price is starting to come down. That's good for restaurants. Earnings have been pretty good. Guidance has been pretty decent. layoffs for any October, the highest since 2003. This is a big deal, ladies and gentlemen. So, this now cementss the December cut. So, people will be pessimistic on equities for a little while and then they'll start to price in a lot more cuts and they'll start to understand the impact of that and then we'll start to get some strength. But, it's going to take a few few weeks in my opinion. I think you got to just shake out a lot of these retail call buying. None of them are getting paid. I told you this four weeks ago. All these people buying calls in November and December are not going to get paid, which means the market is going lower. And that's exactly announced job cuts, you know, moving up. So, you know, Fed needs to get on the stick here. Um, net sales of tech stocks were biggest in over two years as a percentage of market cap and earnings estimates continue to be strong at 305 for next year. So, that's the data of the week. Let's go through some of the headlines. Uh we've got uh Alibaba's instant commerce bet pays off as Tao attracts over a 100 million new nonfood orders. Amen. Hallelujah.

You know, I got a few ask me anything questions about Baxter and Cooper Standard this week. Uh, you read my mind. So, we can only cover a couple a week and those are the two we chose for this week and we gave you some summaries on everything else. So, Cooper Standard, a factory fire, a cyber attack, a labor strike, and extreme weather walk into a bar. The bartender says rough quarter, Cooper Standard. Uh, all right. That's pretty funny, Jeff. But, um, we're going to work on that. We what what should have been another textbook quarter of execution turned into a string of one-off disruptions completely outside Cooper Standards control. The fire at Novellis aluminum plant which produces 40% of the jet uh sheet aluminum used in the auto industry halted F-150 production. Ford's F-150 production. Cooper Standard's largest and most profitable platform which alone made up an estimated 10% of revenues in 2024. in a cyber attack that shut down Jaguar's plant for five weeks, a GM labor strike in Korea, and even extreme weather events, and you have about as many hiccups in a quarter as you can script. In typical shoot first, ask questions later fashion, the market sold off the stock and flushed out the weak hands on the supposed bad quarter. We sat on our hands and watched the show. That's because despite all the noisy headlines uh that overshadowed this quarter, not a single one of these events had any lasting impact on the actual business as our long-term thesis. Let me repeat, zero long-term impact on the business or our thesis. Whether these temporary disruptions are resolved in December or March is completely immaterial to how we think about the stock. What's actually worth paying attention to and even more impressive considering the barrage of short-term headwinds is that Cooper Standard still expects to deliver significant margin expansion 100 basis points to 7.6% adjusted EBIDA margins and generate positive free cash flow for the year on sales that were flat to slightly lower. Aka management continues to focus on controlling what they can control cost efficiency and execution which is exactly what makes them a best-in-class operators and one of the key reasons we got involved in the first place. Not only that, but over the past few weeks, we've gotten a clearer line of sight on the Nolla story, excuse me, recovery. The plant is now expected to reopen earlier than initially expected by year end, and Ford has already confirmed that all lost F-150 production will be fully made up in the first half of 2026. So, for those still fretting over a bad quarter and puking in the hole, may we offer you the world's smallest violin. For the rest of us, the single most important takeaway from the quarter can be summed up in a few sentences from CEO Jeff Edwards. This is Jeff. We're still on target to get there. As we talked, I think 26 is actually going to be better than we originally planned. Not only because of what we discussed a few minutes ago with volumes being made up from some of the fourth quarter's disruption. I also tend to believe that we're going to see increases in overall volumes in some of our some of our key regions. We don't have that yet in our forecast, but based on the leading indicators and certainly based on the amount of new models that are being invested in and coming through the system related to hybrid and electric vehicles, we're pretty excited about the businesses that we've been winning and the overall impact we think that will have on the next several years related to volume. Volumes are recovering. Leading indicators remain strong. Hybrid and EV demand is through the roof. New business winds continue to build. Leverage targets are intact. What more do you need to know? This all circles back to what we've been pounding the table on since day one and what we went into detail in our interview with Jeff Edwards, the CEO himself. If you haven't listened, see below. Record high average age of US passenger cars on the road at 14.5 years, driving higher replacement demand. highest level of growth in US licensed drivers going back more than 40 years. Rising new vehicle incentive, 7.4% today, compared to 9.8% average over the past two decades, and plenty of room to move higher. A growing US population led by 70 million plus millennials entering prime vehicle ownership and family formation years. And not to mention, this would mark the first SAR cycle peak going back to the 1970s that did not exceed 18 million vehicles, 18 million plus units when the population was 40% smaller. Let me repeat that. Not to mention this would mark the first SAR peak cycle going back to the 1970s that did not exceed 18 million units when the population was 40% smaller. So the implication is there's a a possibility we could see a SAR print greater than 20 million units at some point before the end of this cycle. We only need 16 and a half to make beyond insane amounts of money. Um, domestic inventory is still depleted and well below historical averages. Q3 earnings breakdown. We highlighted and underlined all the most important points for you. Go to hedge fun.com, read the article. It's under the most popular things. And here are the 10 key points. Number one, Cooper Standard secured 96.4 million in net new business awards during the quarter. represented an anticipated future analyzed sales and bringing year-to- date net new business to 228.5 million. Most importantly, 83% of these new awards are tied to battery electric or hybrid programs, which come with 80% and 20% cost per vehicle lift respectively. As these programs ramp, typically 1 to three years, they will replace older low margin platforms and drive profitable growth, giving management high confidence in achieving longerterm margin targets. Two, free cash flow during the quarter totaled 27.4 million, up 10.5 million year-over-year, while year-to- date free cash flow remains an outflow of 28.3 million. Management continues to expect positive free cash flow for the full year, implying fourth quarter free cash flow north of $30 million. At quarter end, total cash and cash equivalent stood at 147 million with total liquidity at 313 million. Three, management continues to monitor credit markets and remains optimistic that as results improve, the company will be able to favorably refinance its first lean 613 million at 13.5% and third lean 389 million at 10.625 notes over the next several months. A global refi would have major implications for interest expense uh at fiscal year 2025 guidance 105 to 115 million. For example, if management refies both loans at 9%, it would save 34 million per year in interest expense or $1.90 per share pre-tax. Applying a trough multiple to those savings alone gets you most of today's share price. Four gross profit margins came in at 12.5% during the quarter, up 140 basis points year-over-year, making it third consecutive year of 100 basis points expansion despite reduced or flat production volumes in the two largest operating regions. Management expects further margin expansion 2026, guiding for a 13% plus gross margins driven by new business launches at higher margins, continued footprint optimization, and fixed cost discipline. Five adjusted EBA came in at 53.3 million up 15.6% year-over-year with margins of 7.7% up more than 100 basis points year-on-year. Uh management remains confident that its long-term financial objectives of double-digit EBID margins and double digit returns on invested capital are on track to be achieved by full year 2026. Six. The Nollais aluminum plant fire which halted Ford F-150 production. Cooper Center's top vehicle platform and accounting for an estimated 10% of total sales remains the primary driver behind the 25 million expected profit loss in Q4. Absent the disruption management estimated fullear adjusted IBIDA would have met expectations at 230 million. However, based on Ford's public comments about plans to make up for lost production in the first half of 2026, Cooper Standard Management now expects first half 2026 results to come in ahead of original expectations. Seven capex during the quarter totaled 11.2 million, 1.1 1.6% of sales, bringing year-to-ate capex of 36.5 million, 1.8% of sales. management narrowed its fullear capex target to 45 to 50 million implying 1.1% of sales for the year just a fraction of the bloated heyday averages of 5 to 6%. Uh management has made it clear they have no intention of returning to those levels remaining firmly focused on disciplined investment and getting back to double digit returns on invested capital eight Cooper Standard remains on track to reach its net leverage target of two times or lower by the end of 2027 less than half the current 4.2 two times. Keep in mind this forecast is still being made using manage what management called a quote mortician's forecast for volume and does not yet contemplate global a global refi. Nine. During the quarter, management delivered $18 million in manufacturing and produ purchasing lean savings along with 5 million realized through restructuring initiatives, bringing the cumulative sustainable cost savings impact to adjusted IBIDA to 710 million since uh 2019. Wow. cumulative sustainable cost savings impact to adjusted IBIDA to $710 million by 2019. Man, when I talk about normalized volumes at $10 a share earnings, I'm probably being too conservative, but it is what it is. Uh, management reduced fullear guidance ranges for sales and adjusted IBIDA to reflect the temporary disruptions. Now expecting 2.7 billion in sales, the low end of the prior 2.7 to 2.8 8 billion range and adjusted IBIDA of 205 million versus the prior 220 to 250. Ladies and gentlemen, we're half of the way to what they did. I think they did 400 in 2017 when the stock traded at 146. So keep that in mind. Management remains confident that loss production will be made up for with 2026 shaping up to be a strong year for production driven by increased volumes in key regions and new business wins on models heavily weighted towards hybrids and EVs. You can go through the earnings call highlights. We start and underlined it everything you need to know. Uh Baxter update, everyone's favorite healthc care company. All right. As the saying goes, sunlight is the best disinfectant. And Baxter's new CEO, Andrew Hitter, clearly subscribes to that mantra. This was a textbook example of what we call a kitchen sink quarter. Take all your medicine at once, release every piece of bad news, and reset the bar so that everything moving forward is good news. sales of 2.84 84 billion plus 2%. You wouldn't know it by the stock came in below guidance that had already been revised down to three to 4% adjusted EPS of 69 cents. Beat guidance by 9 cents, but the upside was driven entirely by favorable tax benefit. Without that, the results would have landed on the low end. Fullyear guidance was cut for a second straight quarter. A surprise dividend cut to just a a penny was announced. Noam IQ pump shipment and installation hold is now expected to extend into 2026 with no clear restart timeline. The IV solutions recovery remains slower than expected with some fluid conservation measures dragging into next year. Other than that, how was the play, Mrs. Lincoln? So with all that bad news, why are we smiling so wide we could eat a banana sideways? While the results and outlook were certainly disappointing, they've created a full-on capitulation among impatient investors. The exact kind of dislocation our entire framework is built upon. Despondent selling tied to backer specific issues combined with the washed out sentiment across the entire health care se sector. Washington fears R&D pullbacks, tariffs, you name it, has left the stock price as if it's out to be carried out as if it's about to be carried out on a stretcher. In reality, Baxter's challenges are both temporary and fixable, not the kind of permanent impairment the price action of Mr. Market might suggest. Getting to that con conclusion requires what we like to call burdening ourselves with the facts. So, let's dig in. The two overhangs weighing on Baxter are the Noam IQ recall and the lingering softness in the IV solutions business. The Novam IQ pump was Baxter's first new pump in nearly 30 years and a product company and a product the company had made a massive bet on. It was off to a strong start, driving 50% growth in the infusion business during 2024 and converting several large and important accounts, driving 200 basis points annual market share gain with expectations for another strong year in 2025. Those plans were derailed when the pump was recalled over the summer, prompting management to pause shipments and installations. The restart, once expected by year end, now looks unlikely until 2026. Meanwhile, the IV Solutions recovery has taken longer than expected after Hurricane Helen knocked out Baxter's North Cove manufacturing plant, responsible for 60% of IV supply. I mean, these two sound like uh the book of Job. The the good news is the book of Job after he got through all the uh uh pestilence and famine and uh tests of his faith, he was rewarded with 10x of what he had before. So, uh keep that in mind. Hospitals began rationing fluids and practicing conservation. Production is now fully restored, but hospitals have been slow to return to normal buying patterns, and some level of fluid conservation will likely persist through next year. Together, these overhangs have created a twofur of headwinds for Baxter's highest margin and highest uh largest segment, medical products and therapies, which made up nearly half of total sales in 2024. However, when you look past the price, which ex suggests Baxter is on life support, and focus on the fundamentals, you can see a completely different picture. Margins remain intact and expanding. Revenues are still growing, albeit at a slower pace. Solveny risk is off the table. So, yes, both issues need to be fixed, but this is by no means a permanently impaired business. It is simply a case of investors running out of patience. What this really comes down to is a self-help story, and there's nobody better suited to lead it than newly appointed Andrew Hitter, the new CEO. In since 2017, Hitter has served as CEO of ATS, an industry-leading provider of advanced automations automation solutions for companies in the life sciences, food and beverage, transportation, consumer products, and energy industries. Under hitters leadership, ATS has optimized its portfolio by strategically shifting investments towards higher growth and markets while also delivering meaningful margin improvement. Over a 5-year period, ending with the company's last fiscal year, ATS's adjusted revenues have nearly doubled, representing a low to mid- teens Kagger compound annual growth rate and similar adjusted Ebida Kagger over the same period. Since Mr. Hitter's appointment in 2017, ATS's stock price has more than tripled on the TSX, significantly outperforming major indexes over the same time period. Strong track record of operational exe excellence, disciplined execution and innovation, manage complex operations, generate value for shareholders, blah blah blah. Now, hitter spent 10 years at Danaher Corporation leading a global life sciences and diagnostics innovator in various leadership roles including as president of Veraroot, a global supplier of automated tank gauges. He cut his teeth at Danaher, spending over a decade in leadership roles and mastering the Danahur way. the best-in-class management system built on continuous improvement and operational excellence that has made Danaher one of the most respected companies out there. He then took that playbook to ATS an industryleading automation solutions provider. Baxter was a customer delivering a 5x bagger fiveagger at its peak within six years on the job. Five bagger in six fiveyear at its peak bagger in six years. Now his next project is Baxter, a company long overdue for some operational excellence. Just two months into the job and before even finishing finding the coffee machine, Hitter has already rolled out the Baxter growth and performance system aimed at driving a culture of continuous improvement and enterprisewise enterprisewide efficiency. Sound familiar? So, while Andrew hit her keeps his foot on the gas and works to whip Baxter into a Danaher like shape, think Larry Culp at GE, by the way, the rest of management will keep working day and night to clean up the two temporary overhangs. The next major catalyst will be the investor day slated for 2026, where management will outline the blueprint for getting Baxter back to where it belongs, growing mids single digits, expanding margins into the high teens, and spitting off more cash than it knows what to do with. Until then, we're happy to stand pat and keep picking up cheap shares from the nervous Nellies who make who mistake temporary noise for permanent impairment. More highlighted points from the report and the deck. You can go through that at your leisure. We've got a lot of AMAs. 10 key points. Revenue of 2.84 billion up 2% yearonear. Missed both prior guidance at 3 to 4% growth and street estimates by 42 million. an adjusted EPA EPS of 69 cents, up 41% year-on-year, beat by 9 cents, though upside was almost entirely taxdedriven. Two, despite concerns about a potential slowdown in US hospital capital spending, management has not observed any signs of weakness. In fact, total US capital orders for the care and connectivity solutions segment increased 30% year-over-year, supported by a very strong pipeline, one of the key drivers bei behind CCS's 4% growth in the US during the quarter. Three, Backaxster generated 126 million of free cash flow during the quarter. You would think that they were going out of business the way that the stock is trading and they're generating cash hand over fist, bringing the year-to- date free cash flow to an outflow of 18 million. Management expects continued free cash flow generation in Q4, which is typically the strongest quarter seasonally and further progress progress in 2026 as the company works toward its goal of 80% cash conversion. In addition, recently announced dividend reduction is expected to free up more than 300 million in annual cash flow. Four, operating margins for the quarter came in at 14.9%, up 40 basis points year-over-year, bringing the year-to-ate margins to 15%, an increase of 160 basis points. The improvement was driven primarily by a 240 basis points reduction in SGNA expenses, which totaled 629 million, 22% of sales during the quarter for the full year. Management now expects adjusted operating margins of 14.5 to 15% down from the initial 16 and a half guidance but still an improvement from last year's 13.9% despite ongoing headwinds. Number five, Novam IQ shipment and installation hold is now expected to remain in place beyond year end as management continues to evaluate and test potential corrections. In the meantime, Baxter is offering its legacy spectrum IQ pump as an alternative and continues to see strong customer interest, ramping up production to meet demand. However, management expects the infusion therapy and technologies ITT segment to remain under pressure as the timing and nature of the resolution of the Novam IQ hold have led to some customers to explore alternative solutions. Six, while management remains confident in the medium to long-term strength of the IV solutions business, the recovery has been slower than originally expected with some level of fluid conservation likely into 2026. Management has noted this and has contributed to the softness in certain premixed products. Comparing the current environment to the aftermath of the hurricane Maria in 2017, which took nearly two years for hospitals to return to normalized buying patterns. Baxter continues to work closely with hospitals to improve utilization rates and emphasize the clinical benefits of its products to support recovery. Seven management lowered its fullear guidance for the second consecutive quarter. Now expecting operational sales growth of 1 to2% compared to the original 4 to 5% range and adjusted EPS of 230 to 240 uh versus prior guidance at 245 to 255. The revision is primarily driven by an expected 2% sales decline in Q4 which has historically been Baxter's strongest quarter. Management reiterated that they continue to expect growth next year with an investor day scheduled for 2026 to revive the long-term strategy, review the long-term strategy and financial outlook. Management reduced the quarterly dividend to 1 cent per share beginning in January 2026 payment to free up cash flow for accelerated deleveraging. Management now expects to reach three times net leverage goal by the end of 2026. Nine, management continues to expect estimated tariff impact of 40 million for full year 2025, down from the prior estimate of 60 to 70 million. And 10, Baxter launched ConX 360, its next generation patient monitoring device and latest innovation in its connected monitoring portfolio. The company is already seeing strong customer excitement around the new product, which is expected to be a key growth driver for the Karen connectivity solution segment moving forward. We highlighted all the key points from the earnings call. You can view it at hedge funips.com. VFC Corp. earnings preview and key points. Over the next few weeks, we will publish a full detailed analysis on the names we cover that have reported earnings so far. In the meantime, here are three key points from each company's latest report. VFC Corp. Number one, more brands within the VF portfolio are returning to growth. Last quarter, 60% of the business was growing revenue, up from just 10% a year ago. This quarter ex excluding Dickies, that figure rose to nearly 70%. Timberland delivered 4% growth, marking its fourth consecutive quarter of gains across both DTC and wholesale. The Northace posted 4% growth with all three regions up year-on-year and footwear up double digits across every region. Van's revenue declined 11% but the results improved sequentially and beat expectations with channel rationalization accounting for over 20% of the decline. Altra grew 35% year-onear, its third consecutive quarter of double-digit growth and remains on track to exceed 250 million in annual revenue despite less than 10% brand awareness in the United States. Two adjusted operating income of 330 million came in well ahead of guidance of 260 million to 290 million with margins of 11.8% 8% plus 40 basis points year-on-year, keeping the company well on track to reach its fiscal year 2028 target of at least 10% adjusted operating margins. And three, management continues to clean up the balance sheet with net debt down 1.5 billion, down 21% year-on-year to 5.7 billion, excluding lease liabilities. Net debt stands at 4.2 billion, down 27% year-on-year. Proceeds from the $600 million Dicki sale, which remains on track to close in Q3 fiscal year 2026, will be used for further deleveraging, bringing the company closer to its goal of achieving net leverage of 2.5 times or lower by fiscal year 2028. Etsy posted another standout quarter with gross merchandise sales of 292 million, up 39.4% year-onear and accelerating by 400 basis points sequentially. growth was led by the US where GMS grows rose 59% year-on-year driven by the brand's largest ever US marketing campaign. The added investment will put near-term pressure on margins with total company adjusted ebida margins declining to 25.4% from 27.7% last year. Two, Etsy marketplace gross merchandise sales at 2.4 billion down 2.4% 4% year-on-year came in ahead of expectations and accelerated by 300 basis points sequentially with further improvement expected in Q4. The Etsy app continues to be a major growth driver with app-based GMS up 5% year-on-year and now accounting for 46% of total gross merchandise sales. App users represent a significant opportunity, engaging five times more often, viewing three times more pages per visit, and converting 1.5 times higher than non-app users. Three, management repurchased 2.1 million shares during the quarter for $120 million, bringing year-to- date buybacks to 644 million, 10.8% of the company's 5.95 billion market cap. Since December 2023, share count is down 17% with 356 million remaining under the current authorization and a cash balance sheet of 1.6 billion providing plenty of dry powder to continue. Estee Lauder organic growth sales accelerated to plus 3% a sharp turnaround from last quarter's 13% decline. The rebound was led by grow return to growth in mainland China, tomorrow's newspaper today, ladies and gentlemen, which posted 9% organic sales growth, marking five of the last six quarters that Estee Lauder has gained share in the prestige beauty market. Seven brands delivered double digit growth during the quarter. two profit recovery and growth plan uh remains on track to be substantially completed by in fiscal year 2027 expected to yield annual gross benefits of eight uh 800 million to1 billion. To date, Estate Ladder has approved initiatives for over 70% of the expected gross benefits and more than 50% of the associated charges. All results are already visible with adjusted gross margins expanding 60 basis points to 73.3% and adjusted operating margins up 300 basis points to 7.3%. And three, management reiterated fullear guidance for positive organic sales growth in the range of 0 to 3% and adjusted operating margins of 9.4 to 9.9% which would mark the first return to both growth and margin expansion in four years. Boeing number one. Boeing generated free cash flow of 238 million, its first positive quarter since Q4 2023, crushing street estimates that called for 884 million outflow. Management updated fullear expectations for a usage of 2.5 billion, an improvement from prior guidance of 3 billion. Two, Boeing delivered 160 commercial airplanes during the quarter, up 38% year-on-year, making its highest qual quarterly total since 2018. This brings total delivers to 440 through the first nine months of the year, up 51% year-on-year. Most importantly, the FAA raised the 737 production cap to 42 per month in October, up from 38 previously. and three total company backlog grew 636 billion up 20% since year end and now includes over 5,900 commercial aircraft with both the 737 and 787 sold firmly into the next decade as the world's greatest salesman stays hard at work. Generrack number one global CNI product sales rose 9% during the quarter driven by a doubling of the global backlog of large megawatt generators to more than 300 million over the past 90 days. Covert AI play ladies and gentlemen current capacity stands at 500 million in management plans a major capacity expansion that will effectively double capacity to a billion dollars in annual sales supporting what could be a potentially doubling of CNI product sales over the next 3 to 5 years. Two, residential net sales declined 13% year-over-year with home standby shipments, the company's bread and butter segment with 75% market share, down by a mid- teens rate due to significantly lower power outage environment, marking the lowest Q3 total outage hours since 2015. As a result, management lowered fullear SE sales growth guidance to flat, down from the prior 2 to 5% range. And three, EcoB delivered another profitable quarter driven by stronger than expected sales and significant gross margin improvement. The EcoB installed base grew to 4.75 million homes and the segment remains on track to deliver its first ever positive contribution to Ebidov for the full year. Advanced Auto Parts Comp Store sales rose 3% year-on-year with both pro and DIY channels delivering growth. Pro comps increased more than 4%, marking the fifth consecutive quarter of positive performance, while DIY comps grew in the low single digits that improved sequentially on a 2-year basis. This strength led management to narrow fullear comp sales guidance to uh 7/10 of 1% to 1.3% from prior range of half a percent to 1.5%. Two, adjusted operating margins, the most important metric in the A advanced auto parts turnaround, came in at 4.4. 4% up 370 basis points year onear. That's adjusted operating margins. The strongest quarterly margin performance in over two years. Management narrowed fullear margin guidance to 2.4 to 2.6% up from the prior two to 3% implying 200 basis points of margin expansion in the first year of the turnaround. Three management continues to expect 30 new store openings for the full year, but raised its target for market hub openings to 14, up from the prior guidance of 10. That is not a company on defense. That is a company that is back on offense. Remember last year and the year before they were shutting down all the nonprofitable stores. Now they're growing again. That would bring the total to 33 market hubs by the end of 2025, keeping Advanced Auto on track to reach its goal of 60 by mid 2027. These hubs carry between 75 to 85,000 SKUs and expand same day parts availability across the service area of 69 to 90 stores on average driving 100 basis points lift to supported locations. GXO Logistics GXO delivered record quarterly revenue of 3.4 4 billion, up 8% yearonear with organic growth of 4% and strength across every region. Management reiterated fullear guidance calling for 3.5 to 6.5 organic growth with year-to- date organic growth now at 4.1%. Two new business wins totaled 280 million for the quarter, up 24% year-onear, bringing year-to-ate wins over 800 million and providing a clear line of sight to the expected to exceed 1 billion in 2025. Nearly 700 million of incremental revenue is already secured for 2026, up 50% from this time last year, giving management confidence in both continued growth and margin expansion next year. Three, Winkington in integration officially began in October with the teams already realizing their first win as a combined organization. Most importantly, the 60 million in it expected cost synergies remain on track to be achieved by the end of 2026, providing another tailwind for margin expansion as synergies ramp. The integration also brings meaningful exposure to the industrial and aerospace and defense sectors where GXO $2.3 billion pipeline saw aerospace and defense opportunities rise 30% sequentially. Stanley Black & Decker adjusted gross margins for the quarter came in at 31.6% up 110 basis points year-on-year as management continues to make progress toward the long-term target of 35% plus. Management expects to re reach 33% adjusted gross margins in Q4 and remains confident in achieving 35% by the end of 2026 even if macro conditions do not materially improve. Two, the global cost reduction program remains on track to deliver 2 billion in pre-tax run rate savings by year end with 120 million achieved during the quarter bringing the total program to date savings of 1.9 billion. And three, Stanley Black and Jenner uh Stanley Black & Decker generated 155 million in free cash flow during the quarter and reiterated fullear guidance of 600 million yet trading like they're going out of business. General market very hard for 100 plus year old business but okay uh general market uh still in fear but I think we got a little bit national association are active investment managers uh where 35% equity exposure in the whole now they're at 100 that's why we're seeing a little bit of uh weakness here and that's that normal things in the market basic materials top 30 weights earnings revisions in the last 60 days down 51 basis points or a half a percent for 2026 6 IBD growth index uh estimates up 10% in the last 60 days. So keep an eye on those. Today we got um that was yesterday. Oh, we covered the job stuff from today. Earnings growth, we've touched on good beat rate. Uh 10 10.7% versus 8% estimated. So that's good. Now, let's get on with the ask me anything questions. Uh, first one comes in and we've got uh wrong mailbox. Okay. Little bit of spam. Johnny asks, "Uh, have you ever had to cut a losing investment due to a change in thesis or management?" Um, not that I can remember because again, we're we're not taking margin. We do in turnarounds. The number one thing is solveny risk. So if we can get solveny risk off the table and we got a stock that's down 70 80% uh with fundamentals improving or about to improve or a good jockey, it's just time arbitrage. So that doesn't happen often. We we win the we win the war before we fight the first battle. Okay. We don't make money on the selling. We make money on the buying. Uh but that's a good question. Um, no, none that I can remember of in recent history, like last five, eight years. Uh, David Haldy, thank you for tomorrow's newspaper today. I'm a recent addition to your followers. Started following you in March of this year. Well, welcome. Um, QXO, is your thoughts on a bit? Okay. All right. So, he wants me to look at CMO. So, welcome to the fold. We're glad to have you. Hope you're enjoying the show. Uh, okay. So, I mean, this thing's already sixbagged and free cash flow and revenues are going down. So, I'm going to pass on this one. Hang in there. You're going to learn a lot more over the next year, but uh this is not for me. M Global Snick, thank you so much for doing the Q&As's. I learned a great deal from this segment. Zimmer Biomet, um I think I'm going to like this one. It's healthcare and um I think it's pretty cheap. Let's take a look. Yeah, I like this one a lot. Good job. Have to do some work on that one. Uh next. And if I skip yours, it's because we've either covered it in recent weeks and you didn't listen, which is fine. Just go back and check out the last few AMAs. All right. So, we've got like a hundred questions on FMC this week. So, I'm just going to, you know, Lachland, Neo, everyone else, I'm just going to say your name as I come up to it. Uh, love their podcast. Daily reads, you taught me so much over the past year. I want to thank you for it. You're welcome. Thank you for tuning in. Shared with all my friends and families, too. Double thank you. That's the most important thing. Keep this thing growing. wanted to ask if you're going to take a harder look at FMC. Uh felt close to 50% to the cut the dividend potential chemicals play. Yeah, I I think FMC I mean the key with FMC is going to be solveny risk and I think they're okay on that front. So, um you know they they went they went free cash flow let's see here. Yeah, they went free cash flow negative last quarter. I mean, let's take a look at the balance sheet here. I think it's generally okay. Um, I mean, look, it's not without risk. They got 300 million in cash, three billion of receivables, and See if I can get this thing out of the way. There it goes. Okay. Exit drawing. All right. Now, where is my There it is. All right. Where are the liabilities? Long-term debt is three billion. 400 million free C and they got three billion receivables. Free cash flow. is negative in the last year by half a billion. So that's what what has people nervous um now the business has been deteriorating the last few years. all chemical businesses have. Um I think that you know this is a high-risk highreward stock and um you know I mean what what what can happen here is you can buy it at 15 and it can go to eight before it goes back to 50. But um if you're not on margin and you treat it like a business, you know, you can probably start to build something here. I would at least get on the last eight calls and understand what they said was going to happen and what actually happened before you put money to work. But um this is, you know, kind of falls within the framework. Has a little bit more risk than I like, which is why we don't have exposure. But, um I think it's decent and I think it's going to take a lot a bit longer to recover than you think. But I think it's I think it's generally okay. But you got to do your own work. Jackson Matthews, what's your opinion on open AI requesting the government to guarantee their debt? You got a saying in New Jersey called bunch of scumbags is what what I have to say about that. Chris Cordova, what do you think about uh thank you for sharing your time and knowledge with those of you are not yet clients. I recommend your channel to friends and family, hoping they will gain from it as I have. Thank you very much. He's asking about Lending Tree. Uh historically, I don't like this type of business. I know it's going to look good on paper, but um I'm going to pass. You cannot understand like there's a huge amount of opacity on the level of risk and if you catch a recession, those businesses gets hammered first. It doesn't mean it won't work. It's just a business that I wouldn't be in. Uh Katie Modi, a couple years back you ranked Baba, CPS, and biotech index as your top three picks. What are your current top three or five picks currently? No real change. I think I think Cooper Sanders's got a lot of upside. I think Baba's got a lot of upside. I think the biotech basket has a lot of upside. But I mean, it's like asking what's your favorite kid? And the answer is we love them all equally. We've got a lot of incredible positions across the portfolios. And uh um you know, some are just getting started, which is what's exciting when new money comes in and why we run in separately managed accounts is we're not going to put a brand new client in a stock that's up 100 or 150%. We put them in those that are just leaving the station. And right now there are a lot of co companies that are still just leaving the station. So we're excited about those. They might have a little bit more upside, but um that's for clients to figure out by just logging into their portfolios and seeing what we're in. And Silva uh thanks for all your great work. Share your knowledge every week. Uh uh Zoetis and Trex. Um try not to do two. It's just, you know, we got we're blessed. We have a lot of followers. Uh Zoetas. I don't like TX. Um, I think TX is getting interesting, but right now you're catching a falling knife. I do think this is going to be a good play in the next 6 to 12 months. I just think you're a little bit too early, and it's still showing no real signs of recovery yet. Uh, well, this quarter it had a turnaround in free cash flow. Um, let me see here. Let's take a look at this balance sheet. Yeah, we're building a roof deck, so we'll probably use some of their stuff. Um, the cash, this is the problem, though. Why is their cash so low? Is this that small of a business? They have no debt. H I didn't realize this company was so small. Yeah. I mean, you had a lot of pull forward remodel. Um, I think you're early on this. Just wait. sit on your hands. Uh, but you're right. You're just early. Jay, Ela, Boise, Cascade, uh, we always listen and share with friends. Thank you so much. Uh, BCC, this is a falling knife right now. When you when you blow up that many institutional shareholders, it takes a while to rebuild a base. I wouldn't be jumping on this yet, even though it's quote unquote cheap. It's also turn negative free cash flow. I'd stay away for now, Jay. Just keep putting put alerts in your trading system to take a look at it. Um $10 lower and $10 lower and send it back in. Um yeah, we co uh thank thanks Jason. We covered uh Baxter pretty extensively. Fresh Pet, I hate these businesses. Um anything related to pets always sounds good in theory. Never works as a public company. Whether it's the uh veterinary rollups, the vitamins, the pharmaceuticals, I see they're getting close to free cash flow, they're improving. It's not for me. Um, no. Pass. It's just a bad business. It just doesn't work because the minute you have a recession, people starve their dogs before they starve themselves. So, it just doesn't work. Robert Pollson, been following you for a couple years. Can't express how much I've learned and continue to grow as an investor with the value you provide. Thank you very much. That's very kind. Um, Baxter blah blah blah. Yeah, I mean he's asking about did you find the previous CEO? Look, they were growing until they hit those roadblocks. So he wasn't the best. Uh but he was kind of up against headwinds and the hill and all that stuff. Uh so yeah, would I have wanted a new jockey back, you know, on day one? Yes. But you're going to get one sooner or later. And if you buy durable businesses at great prices, good things happen. Whether that's they change out the CEO. You can't predict when they're going to change out the CEO or if they're going to change out the CEO. Most people would have predicted they would change out Jeff Edwards. They kept him and he's been a rock star. So, you can't think in those terms. Uh but, uh, decent question for sure and thanks for following. Divas Lung. Uh, tracks. We just covered that. I think it's a little too early. Rick Richards, Restoration Hardware is down over the past couple years. How you doing, Rick? Uh, and free cash flow accelerating with modage leverage tied to more upper income consumer share count steady. Seems like an interesting one. What do you think? They've got an amazing restaurant uh right in town in Newport at Fashion Island. Um, I actually haven't been. Caitlyn's been. And um yeah, so this one's looking like it's trying to recover. It's always had a high multiple. Um Why is the cash so low? I mean, how small is this business? Again, what do they have in terms of debt? They got $2.5 billion of debt. And I'm showing 34 million of cash and 100 million of receivables. I mean, that's not ideal. Plus, they've got another $1.2 $2 billion of leases, which, you know, in theory is not debt, but they changed the accounting on that a few years ago. I'm not loving this one. I, you know, and and Rick's a credit guy. Uh Rick, I'd have a look at the bonds before I looked at the stock on this one. So, at least you're secured by something. I don't think I'd buy the equity here yet. Um, Theo Djardan, you mentioned some stocks institutional base is broken. It'll take a long time to rebuild the base. Uh, understand your bullishness of polish a clear improvement in fundamentals. Isn't this also true for the stock? Yeah. So, we've been waiting a while and when it turns, it turns hard. But the um this is the sign of an impatient investor, by the way. And these are the type of people that wind up selling us all their stock. I what you know, a person like this, and I know this is a fake name, which is why I'm able to get on them because I think that's an ex- hockey player's name. Must be one of my Canadian followers. Um what would get a person like this out of every single share that they have is a move to 49 before it goes to 200. Um and we'd just be cleaning up house on that. But um I don't think we're going to get that. Um we're a buyer here. And yeah, so what I'm talking about with institutional bases often when you see these things crack, people want to buy them right here. And what I'm saying is even though the fundamentals get better, it takes a couple of years to build rebuild a base. And that's exactly what's happening now. And we are going back to the mammoth cycle of emotion. We are right now in aversion. Okay, we're right here on PayPal. As a matter of fact, we need to we need to be buying even more of this is what we need to be doing. Um, so thanks for that. Next, we we did the exact same thing with Baba, by the way. This is so amazing. This is 100% aversion and it's right before it takes off. Um, Baba, same thing. You had this whole three-year base and then right here was aversion. That's what got everyone screwed in screwed in the head. It shot to 100 and then came back to 80. Exactly like PayPal. And and why why why this even matters because this is all hocus pocus nonsense. The reason it matters is to get your mind through all of this nonsense and all these negative stuff when you know the fundamentals are sound. If you don't know the fundamentals, you don't be in this business. Hire someone who does this for a living. Um, but if you do, then you got to start to worry about sentiment. And that's exactly the type of sentiment that's happening right now, which makes me want to buy a ton more of PayPal. So, moving along. Um, hey Tom, thanks again for the great p podcast referring to friends. You rock man. Nikolai Aaron Johnson, what are your thoughts on Leslie used to be a billion dollar business 100 million in free cash flow last quarter and uh that's that. So, uh, Leslie, I I remember like yesterday some of the big talking heads were pitching the out of this thing when it had just gone public and shot up and look what they did. I mean, anyway, um, I just knew that was going to be the outcome and like these guys with a straight face, they actually believed it. They said, "Well, all these pools were installed during COVID and blah blah blah." And they're completely wrong. So, still negative fre. Now, this is a train wreck. Um, wait till you get a quarter of free cash flow. Some businesses should never be public. That's one of them. And then you could revisit it. Jeff Vandenberg, I'd rather buy P. Uh, we already covered Baxter Eay Naman. Uh, Barry Celabout. I don't know what that is, but let's see if it comes up. B A R Y. That is a Swiss company I guess. And what do they do? Chocolate and cocoa products. Chocolate academy centers. All right. B A R N. But I thought no one was ever going to eat chocolate or drink alcohol ever again. And here the revenues are going through the roof. Why is the free cash flow so bad if the revenues are climbing? Would they make a dumb acquisition? Um, yeah, I wouldn't touch this until you see a quarter of positive free cash flow. Not for me. Hank Douglas, uh, scooped up some VF court below 14. Good job. Uh, INMD. Yeah, I think we looked at this one last week. I'll do a quick look again. And I think with these, you just really, really need to understand the technology before you do anything. So, I mean, it's not a convincing turn in cash flow yet. Um, but I think it's probably cheap enough. It's in healthcare. I would start doing work on this. This one might be certainly worth looking at it. It's in the right hated group. Uh, you just have to make sure whatever they have has a moat because they only IPOed five years ago, which would probably preclude us from doing anything with it. We like businesses that have worked through cycles. Here's Alex Resnik again asking about tracks. We already did that. Uh, thank you for your question, Alan K. FMC, we covered. Thank you for that, Tim D. Whirlpool, we've covered. Wait for positive free cash flow. Um, yeah, it looks good, but the fundamentals haven't shown any signs of turning yet. So, you got to listen to a bunch of calls and see what they say they're going to do and uh what they what are they doing. I mean, these revenues are h haved. So, I I want to see more signs. You got to you got to understand what are they starting to deliver on what they say they're doing in the turnaround plan or not. Uh Constantine Hzer asking our target for advanced auto parts. We covered it in the original ones. So you need to go back and read everything we've ever wrote around advanced auto parts and uh see where the stock traded the last time operating income hit the levels we expected to hit this time and do the math. But it's a lot higher. Um, we're not going to give you, we're going to teach you how to fish. We're not going to give you a fish. Uh, updates on Stanley. We're buyers at these levels for sure. Gasper, uh, FMC, same story. Luke Wheeler, Sandridge, we covered. Nah, we we like our exposure. We don't like Sand Ridge as much. I think it'll work though because I think the energy sector is going to start to fly. Um, I just don't like the uh EMP names. Uh, but uh should be okay. Not as good as the ones we're in. Adam Hawk, Deckers. I I never even Hookah and Uggs should all be taken around back and lit in a bonfire. I mean, I don't understand why these things even exist, but um yeah, not yet. Talk to me at $40. I think it's just a fad that finally has had its day. Pedro Verinos. Oh, Pedro, how are you, my friend? From Portugal. Uh, just give me a name. What is the price of the name here? My friend from Algarve. It's actually my cousin's husband. Even better than a friend. Uh, he's family. Novo Nortis. Yeah, we covered this last week. Um, so, uh, you'll have to come out to Newport Beach to visit. I don't think I'll be back in Portugal anytime soon, unless you want to hop over to London this weekend. Um, and grab dinner. Let's see. Uh, Novo. I I I think it's it's basically there. Um, you know, people had asked that in the 60s and the 50s we said wait till you get to the low 40s. I think we're kind of there. I think it's okay. I'd really love it at 30. I don't think it's going to happen. Um, but I generally think you're okay, but we're not doing anything with it. Luca Mill, thank you so much. New Brands. This is what we call a value trap. Cheap for a reason. Completely broken. Uh, this looks like a trading vehicle that's probably due for a bounce. Let me just make sure it's not going out of business. Uh, negative free cash flow revenue is never recovering. Let's just see here about, you know, this is just an example of like, you know, it's almost like craft hinds. How the hell do you screw up Hines effing ketchup? Only a could screw up Hines effing ketchup. And these guys have the only goddamn marker in the world that everyone wants to buy and they can't figure out how to make money. Like anyway, so let's see what their balance sheet looks like and see if they can live long enough to get a CEO that had, you know, that can take their head out of their ass long enough for this thing to throw off a ton of free cash. Um, and the answer is they got four $5 billion of debt with 200 million of cash, 943 million of receivables. It's a little levered for my liking. You got to go through and see. Um, this is going to be a trading vehicle. I think you'll get a few quarters. I think it's going to work. I'm not going to be involved. It's a lowquality business, but you know, you get a great CEO and it could it could really hum. I just I just don't love it. Uh Chad asked about Baxter. I think we covered that. Uh let's see. The guy wants me on his podcast. I'll do Ivan. I'll do your hundth episode. Uh, Brian Mlean, Primo Brands, [Music] love the pod, the insight. Tell everyone I know about hedge fun tips with Tom Hayes. Huge fan. Buying merch via PayPal soon. Love it, my man. Appreciate all that. Let's take a look at Primo Brands for you. All right. So, it's falling 50%. Yeah. I mean, look, it's growing. Margins are growing. Um, it's just too new for me. We want to see how these things act through many cycles. So, uh, what do they do here? Pre-filled water exchange, water filtration, water refill stations, Poland Spring, Arrowhead, Primo Water. Yeah. Uh, it's not for me. I I'd look at it again at like between 12 and $15. Um, I don't love this business though, but um, I understand why you're looking at it and you'll probably do okay with it. Andy Rutherford, uh, so happy I found your podcast. I've been recommending it to everyone who's interested in finance here in the UK. Uh, could you have a look at Mosaic? Seems like the whole fertilizer sector is being smashed. Yes, it is. Um, I think there are better ways to play it. We get this one almost every week. Not yet. It's not cheap enough. Call me in five dollars. 20 or below. I'll take another look. Teddy Osborne. CMG covered that last week. Not yet. Well, it's getting close. I I like a two handle there. Like maybe 25 or 20. I don't know if I'm going to get it. Uh, but it's just a reset. And you know, here's a situation where a lot of institutions got shellacked buying in the 60s, now selling in the 30s. They can't have this on their books. Um, Daniel is asking about FMC. We covered Falconee asking about FMC. We covered. Uh, how does a class action suit filed against VFC affect your outlook on VFC? We're buying it. That's just a bunch of ambulance chaser low lives trying to extract money from a company. Um, and you know what? They probably get a little payout and they go away because that's that's what they do. Kro asks, uh, we covered that. FMC, thank you, Kro. Good to hear from you. Robert Lee, FMC, we covered it. Thank you very much. Jimmy Jones, FMC, we covered it. Thank you very much. Yakz Palm, we covered it. Thank you very much, Jack Z. Geopark, GPRK. What do they do, revenues are declining, natural gas exploration in Chile? I don't want to mess around South America. We got enough natural gas here. Get a good well-run company in the US and we got it with Comtock. I don't need to mess around with like company risk, country risk, gas price risk. I don't need all those risks. I just need one risk. The price of natural gas, lowest cost producer, huge operating leverage, good people involved that have made money over time and go with that. Griffin Brown asks, "Yeah, Griffin, you're thinking too hard, man. Just look at find a good business. Stop worrying about the Fed and all that stuff." Thank you for listening. Uh, Adam asks about uh becoming uh Oh, yeah. All right, Adam. Well, thank you very much. When you're ready, we're ready to go. Uh, we open up next quarter probably in January sometime for the smaller accounts. So, thank you for that and congratulations on all the success you've had listening. Um, yeah, Chris on Canada. We talked about that. And that's it. So, we'll be back next week, same time. Well, I have no idea what time. It's going to be a different place. It'll probably be Edinburg or London or somewhere in Scotland. Uh, and it'll be great. Uh, so I want to thank you for tuning in. We'll be back next week. In the meantime, make it a great one. Bye for now. [Music] [Music] Heat. Heat. [Music] [Music]
