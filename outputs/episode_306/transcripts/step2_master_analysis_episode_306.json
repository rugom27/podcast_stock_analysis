He emphasizes the importance of being selective and focusing on laggards, small caps, and companies that will benefit from reshoring and lower rates. He is extremely bullish on Alibaba, calling it a \"pile in on\" opportunity and highlighting its growth in e-commerce, cloud, and AI. He also expresses optimism about Intel due to government support and its potential to alleviate supply constraints for Nvidia. He is also very bullish on QXO and Generac.",
