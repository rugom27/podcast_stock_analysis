And then you look, 79% have come in better than expected on revenues. Yeah. So, that tells you a lot, does it not? that these are companies that are making money. They are doing well and they're beating estimates. >> Yeah. And and with the market being a discounting mechanism looking out to 2026, 13.6% estimated earnings growth, close to 7% revenue growth. So things are firing on all cylinders. And then you're going to have the afterburner uh Powell just in time Powell. Maybe not too late Powell, maybe just in time Powell. Uh lowering rates, which is going to help what? It's going to help small caps. It's going to help the unmnificent 493 that have kind of lagged.

T\n### FEATURED_COMPANY_DEEP_DIVES\nhere is one name on there that you say pile in on. >> Look, the bane of my existence. We brought our basis down over the years to $82. Yeah, it's doubled off the bottom. So people are like, did I miss it? You haven't missed it. It's just getting started with Alibaba. Okay, Alibaba is kind of the Amazon of China. Chinese stocks, the Hang Sang index has outperformed the S&P by 3 to one this year, 30% year-to- date versus 10%. Alibaba is kind of the the key component. They've got number one, it's a toll taker on the middle class, okay? So, they've got the largest retail business in Taoba and T-Mol. Uh they've got 40% of the cloud business. Think Amazon Web Service. They're growing like a weed. 18% per year. You know what's growing the fastest? The AI component. >> The chatbot that they've come out with. Exactly. It's unbelievable. Number one, it's faster on many metrics. Number two, that business is growing triple digits every quarter for the last seven consecutive quarters, and their international commerce business is growing at about 30%. >> So, what is your answer when we see that the Dow\n\n### FEATURED_COMPANY_DEEP_DIVES\nthat you say pile in on. >> Look, the bane of my existence.

I think if you chase the indices, you're going to be disappointed. But here's some data for you. Uh over the last 100 years, we get a 20% correction every 3 and 1/2 years. We've had three of those in the last 5 years. So, we're kind of stuck with recency bias. Everyone thinks what just happened, the big correction in April, is going to happen again. They're going to be disappointed. You want to buy these small dips, three to five percent pullbacks into year end. We're going to resolve higher. Earnings are there, growth is there, Fed policy is there, and positioning is still a little bit off sides. \n### MISCELLANEOUS\nI think everyone expects the numbers to be good on topline and bottom line. Uh but the stock is near priced for perfection. So that guidance on China is going to be critical. 10 15% of revenues and earnings uh moving forward and uh and the outlook because the bottom line is you know believe it or not the best thing that could ever happen to Nvidia is that the Intel deal succeeds. So Nvidia's revenue growth rate has decelerated not for lack of demand but for lack of supply. They only get a limited allocation from Taiwan Semiconductor. They need excess capacity of production of advanced chips. And this $10 billion deal the 18A node in Arizona is going to be critical because all the designers what people don't realize that their business models rely on the kindness of strangers. Okay? If Taiwan semiconductor ceases to exist, Nvidia ceases to exist. So we need Intel to have that advanced production and that's that is the dark horse in the semiconductor play and uh Nvidia watch the guidance. The numbers should be strong. \n### FEATURED_COMPANY_DEEP_DIVES\nSo does that mean that you are supportive of Trump's new deal with Intel to turn that grant money into equity stake for the US government in Intel? >> I'm a major shareholder and I'm smiling so wide I could eat a banana sideways. I'm telling you this is the best thing that's ever happened to Intel. Okay. Lip Bhutan is a proven winner. He turned around >> is a proven loser. >> Yeah, but you're happy about it because there the government now has a dog in your fight. >> 100%. Okay. And but I bet on Lip Boutan. Lip Bhutan turned around Cadence Design Systems when the stock was down 86%. It was a 68 bagger over the next 14 years. This guy is a winner. If anyone can turn it around, it's Lip Bhutan. And now we've got the existential risk off the table. Government backs stop. We're going to the promised land. >> I don't think that was the question, though. Are you happy that the government's in the deal, not the leader? >> Yes, I am happy that the government's in the deal because the implicit uh assumption if I'm a chip designer and I want access uh to or an ear in Washington and I'm buying chips from Intel when I could buy them from Taiwan Semiconductor. I could buy them in theory from Huawei, which is not going to happen, or Samsung. But I'm putting my orders with Intel and I say, \"Hey, I want a meeting. I need additional help. We need extra production.\" They're going to take that meeting if I'm showing that I'm that I'm a consumer. And I love what Trump said when he was excited when Intel's stock price is going up because it means America is getting richer because we as the taxpayers own 10% of the company. >> The identification of the supply chain boost for Nvidia out of Intel, I think, is the key there. I think that that honestly talk I don't think we win. Well, I I think there's something to be said there, but if you remember during World War II, we took over all the factories to develop weapons. Whether you were making furniture, whether you were making what, you started making weapons for the war effort. Um I I think we're in a catch 22 in in the you know, not giving China our chips because they were very dependent on us up until about 2 3 years ago. They needed everything we could sell them they would take. And now because they've been forced to their technology advancement has I mean if you look at Alibaba's uh um uh large language models are beating on many metrics against chat GPT against others. So as we move into inference believe it or not that edge in advantage uh uh is less important as it is in the large language models you just need huge amount of chip power and those are commodity chips. So, I think there are unintended consequences of government involvement in that. China now has been forced to up their chip game because they can't get what they want. And uh and I think long term, I liked it better when they were dependent on us and we could show \n### MISCELLANEOUS\nBy the way, a big holding of ours uh we were buyers in the low 80s is Disney. They screwed up the same thing. You know what? They've kind of fixed it. Not perfect. >> They got a long way to go, though. They got a long way from 175 to 117. >> But look, it's up to 120. I mean, that's a 50% move off the lows. >> And it's still down damn near 100%. But they almost destroyed it. But the point is these things linger. Yeah. How long has it lingered though? It's lingering. A long time. \n### FEATURED_COMPANY_DEEP_DIVES\n\n\ninvest in reshoring, invest in the things that are going to really drive Main Street. If you remember his first term, Wall Street did okay, but there was some volatility. Main Street in terms of real wages did a better than ever. Okay? And I think he's he's setting the stage for that to be the case where you're going to see Main Street prosperity. You saw the CB consumer confidence numbers better than expected this morning. You see real GDP now this morning 2.2%. Not bad for Q3. So all of this is positive and it can't just be AI capbacks. We got to build real stuff 100%. \n### MISCELLANEOUS\nFed is here to do its job and only its job and we're going to do it right every time and by the way at the very least where is the announcement this morning she is on leave until we gather the facts\n\n### HEADLINES_AND_NEWS\nhere is the announcement this morning she is on leave until we gather the facts. Pow gains a lot of credibility if he does that. \n\n### MISCELLANEOUS\nCEO of In-N-Out Burger is moving her headquarters to Tennessee, expanding outside of California. This was a Californiabased company. This is part of the culture of California and they're moving out.\n\n### HEADLINES_AND_NEWS\nPresident Trump continues to allude to the fact that he's going to meet with Xi. They're going to have a deal. I think that's going to be very constructive for for both parties. If you look at Chinese equities this year, by the way, no one's paying attention to it's the covert rally. They're outperforming US equities 3 to1. Hang Sang's up 30% year to date. Uh S&P's up about 10% year-to- date. You got c companies like Alibaba, their their um their large langu language models like Quen 1.0 2.0 are outperforming Chat GPT and some of the others on many different metrics. Uh you can buy 20% estimated earnings growth from an Alibaba for 13 times earnings. Okay, here in the US you've got Magnificent 7 decelerating earnings growth from 33% last year. next quarter is going to be right around 10%.

This is part of the culture of California and they're moving out. ### HEADLINES_AND_NEWS\n>> Yeah, I I think it's critically important the the deal with China towards the end of the year. And President Trump continues to allude to the fact that he's going to meet with Xi. They're going to have a deal. I think that's going to be very constructive for for both parties. If you look at Chinese equities this year, by the way, no one's paying attention to it's the covert rally. They're outperforming US equities 3 to1. Hang Sang's up 30% year to date.

By the way, that's not in the\n\n### HEADLINES_AND_NEWS\n\n I think what the administration is trying to do is those critically important areas that we have to have for national security. Minerals that are not able to necessarily stand on their own perfectly at the moment that we need them and to invest in the future. That's where the government steps in to make us competitive with the stuff that China's subsidizing that's competing with us. In the case of Loheed Martin, they are perfectly fine on their own. They will continue to do great things, innovate, and the government needs them. They will continue to get 97%. \n### MEDIA_APPEARANCE_RECAP\nEverybody's waiting for Nvidia. Uh Tom Hayes is joining us this morning to take us through this. Let's talk Nvidia. Their report after the market closes this afternoon. Uh Nvidia, if it moves down, just supposing it did. If if Nvidia took the market down and took Nvidia down, >> it would be a dip. Would you buy the dip? >> You do want to buy these dips, but you want to be selective. St. We've got a lot of tailwinds. >> You can't select the dip you're going to take. >> Well, you got to buy the the right stock. So, would I chase the Mag 7? Would I chase Nvidia off 5%? No, I wouldn't. I'd be buying the lagards that are going to benefit from lower rates. I'd be buying small caps. I'd be buying the unmagnificent 493 that are going to refinance their debt at lower rates and take off and be a tailwind for the economy. I'd buy the ones that are going to benefit from reshoring and Trump policies. That's where I'd be focused. The things that haven't quite moved. Why? because managers are still behind their benchmarks and they got to play catch-up. Dips will be bought. \nOkay. Housing, but don't buy the builders. Their margins are going to go down as the production goes up. Buy the suppliers. Building suppliers like QXO, Stanley Black & Decker, GenerRack has had this huge run. Uh that's going to continue. autos auto and don't buy the producers buy the suppliers the Cooper standards of the worlds that's supply because volumes are going to go up we've got lowcost energy we got steel we've got all the components incentives going in and the average car on the road 13.5 years USA is going to benefit okay 88 cuts around the world US zero cuts international stocks are outperforming US by 10% this year because of that money goes where it's treated best we start cutting that money is going to come back \nWhich energy stocks would you be buying now? >> Okay. Well, it's time to put Don Kyote and his windmills back in the barn. We like natural gas. Okay. Comtock Resources. Jerry Jones, the owner of the Dallas Cowboys, owns 75% of the stock. Huge play in the Hannesville shale. Unlimited cheap energy. Second one we like is National Oil Well, Varco, N OV. They do onshore and offshore drilling, uh production, servicing. They're the number one player. Great balance sheet. We love these two energy plays and they're not so sensitive to the price of crude particularly national oil wellco. So we love that to get what we need with AI and all the demand. These are the two stocks. \nHis reshoring plan is working. If you look at US AutoSAR, sell through, it's oscillated between 18 million units and 15 million units a year for the last 45 years. When he came into office, we were touching on 15 million units, 45 year lows. We're now getting close to 16. We're going to go back up to 18. What do you need for cars? You need lowcost energy. You need steel. You need domestic production. It's just beginning. He's 100% right. And then you need lower rates for the demand to to kick in. We're going to get that in the next couple of quarters. \nThen I want to thank um again uh Christian Dagger over at the at Barney and Co. want to thank Mel Montana for having me on NYC live down at the New York Stock Exchange.\nJoining me now is Tom Hayes, chairman and managing member of Grey Hill Capital. Tom, welcome to NYC Live. >> Thanks for having me, Ashley. Glad to be here. \nYeah, unquestionably. I mean what uh Chair Powell did on Friday was he acknowledged the dual mandate. We've been seeing cracks in the labor market, weakening of the labor market. Even their own uh uh summary of economic projections was projecting 1.4% real GDP. So it's about time that they stop focusing on inflation, which may they acknowledge may have a shortterm bump due to tariffs, but then roll over and focus on the labor market. They're over a 100 basis points too restrictive. Everyone knows it. It's really hurt the housing market. It's really hurt people trying to buy a starter home. So, this is very positive. Not only 84% of a cut in September, but an 84% of two cuts by December. So, that's very, very positive for the markets. \nI know we get some inflation numbers on Friday, but I think more important than that is going to be the employment numbers. the jobs report the first Friday in September is going to be the most important thing. Uh if that shows continued weakening, it's a guaranteed lock for the cut. Maybe even 50 basis points if if the jobs uh report shows some weakness. As far as the inflation number, I think that'll have a lower weight this time around uh than than the uh than the employment numbers. \nWell, I mean the bar was low. 4.8% earnings growth expected before we started. Came in 11.8%. So, it's not just that we beat and all the numbers were great. The most important thing was the guidance. And what we're seeing is for 2026 estimates have gone way up. Okay, they were down as low as $295 a share in earnings up to 303 as of the end of this earning season, which takes the multiple down a little lower. companies are getting confident. They're up upgrading their guidance and that's the formula for good things to happen.\n\n### MEDIA_APPEARANCE_RECAP\nmarkets. >> Anything else uh the Fed will be watching uh most closely for, you know, before its next policy meeting in September. >> I know. I know we get some inflation numbers on Friday, but I think more important than that is going to be the employment numbers. the jobs report the first Friday in September is going to be the most important thing. Uh if that shows continued weakening, it's a guaranteed lock for the cut. Maybe even 50 basis points if if the jobs uh report shows some weakness. As far as the inflation number, I think that'll have a lower weight this time around uh than than the uh than the employment numbers. >> So earning season is wrapping up. This is the third straight quarter of double digit double digits earnings growth. What is your takeaway from this earnings season? >> Well, I mean the bar was low. 4.8% earnings growth expected before we started. Came in 11.8%. So, it's not just that we beat and all the numbers were great. The most important thing was the guidance. And what we're seeing is for 2026 estimates have gone way up. Okay, they were down as low as $295 a share in earnings up to 303 as of the end of this earning season, which takes the multiple down a little lower. companies are getting confident. They're up upgrading their guidance and that's the formula for good things to happen. >> So investors who bought the dip in April um you know proved to be successful. What is your guidance for investors for the rest of 2025? >> Okay. Well, we've been pounding the table bullish the last few months. So we we are smiling so wide we could eat a banana sideways. However, Ashley, the the key thing here is  the markets moved a long way in a short period of time. So I think if you're just chasing the indices expecting a lot more, you might be a little bit disappointed because that's basically a MAG7 index. MAG 7 earnings growth has decelerated. So it was 33% last year. It's down this quarter. It's going to be possibly below 10% for the first time and the multiple hasn't contracted. Conversely, unmnificent 493 international small cap, all the lagards. That's the new catch-up trade because managers got caught flat-footed. Most of them were sellers in the hole, not buyers. the net $1 trillion of equities got sold on uh April 7th be you know right around liberation day. So they still have to play catch-up. They're not going to chase the mag seven. They're going to buy those things where they think they can get out performance into year end to hopefully beat their benchmarks and keep their jobs. So uh so that's where I would be focused. Small caps, midcaps, value versus growth, some international and that's that's where we're uh looking for opportunities. >> And anything else you're advising clients on right now? I think that um you have to be we're we're very constructive on the markets in the economy, but we need to be very very selective on where we allocate new capital because there are still tremendous opportunities even after the 30% rally off the lows. Um but you you have to pick the right ones and that's where you're going to get outperformance into year end in the lag laggered uh stocks and in the catch-up trade for for managers. And just to shift back to earnings, we have a pair of notable\n\n### MISCELLANEOUS\nmarkets moved a long way in a short period of time.

Small caps, midcaps, value versus growth, some international and that's that's where we're uh looking for opportunities. \n### FEATURED_COMPANY_DEEP_DIVES\nNvidia is reporting on Wednesday. NYC listed Alibaba on Friday. What should investors be looking for? >> Um, as a major holder of Alibaba for a couple of years, brought our bases down to $82. I think Alibaba is going to knock shoot the lights out again. Uh, they're So, for for those who don't know, it's like the Amazon uh of uh of China. They've got 40% of the e-commerce market. It's a toll taker on the middle class. They got 40% of the cloud business. Think Amazon web services and growing. They're the cheapest AI play in the world. They have stakes in pretty much every AI startup in China. They've got the fastest large language models in in the Quen offerings. And that business, their AI products have grown triple digits every quarter for the last seven quarters. And I think we're going to see the same thing this quarter. So you got 20% expected earnings growth next year with Alibaba trading at about 13 times earnings. You can't get that anywhere in the United States. And then President Trump keeps saying, \"I'm going to meet with Xi and China and etc. We're going to shake hands.\" The minute they shake hands, this stock is going to be up so so big because Chinese stocks have outperformed US stocks. Most people don't know this this year. Hang's up 30%, S&P is up 10%. So that's that's where I'd be focused on. Uh personally as it relates to Nvidia earnings are probably going to be good. Okay, we know that the demand is there. The question is the supply and their guidance looking forward. It is uh priced for really good things to happen. So if any aspect of the guidance is less than expected or slightly weak, you could have a little bit of short-term turbulence, but it's a juggernaut. And the big play that's going to help Nvidia that no one's paying attention to is Intel because Nvidia's sales growth rate has slowed down dramatically. Not due to lack of demand, lack of supply. Taiwan semiconductor can only give them so much allocation. If we stand up Intel to produce these advanced chips, which now the government has backstopped, uh that's going to be really really good for Nvidia as well as Intel.\n### MEDIA_APPEARANCE_RECAP\nUS President Donald Trump buying a 10% stake in Intel. And today he's boasted about the government's stake, uh saying he's determined to do similar deals. What exactly does this mean? Well, I think this is the best news we've heard in a while, Bissy. I I think you needed to see the government backs stop for Intel. It's a signal to the world that Intel is here to stay. And it is a national security matter. We need to produce chips in the US. Intel Intel is furthest along. They're at the 10 yard line. Uh and they needed this boost to get into the end zone and and spike the football. So I think that while Kevin Hasset this morning said that, you know, the government is not going to push people to buy Intel chips, I think if you want to curry favor with the US government now, uh, as a major stakeholder in Intel, you're going to direct some of your orders to Intel. And and the fact of the matter is, uh, there's a bottleneck. I mean, uh, Nvidia's revenue growth slowdown uh, in terms of growth rate has not been for lack of demand. it's been for lack of supply. There's only so much allocation that Taiwan Semiconductor can give them. And now with Intel as a player and uh finishing out these fabs and being able to supply in coming years, it's going to be phenomenal for the acceleration of AI globally and productivity and everything else that goes along with it. And then you couple that with um it also has encouraged further investors. We saw Masiohi Sun uh put in for SoftBank $2 billion last week. Why was it timed to last week? No one was racing to give Intel money uh until there were rumors that the government was stepping in and all of a sudden SoftBank stepped in behind them. I think we're going to see more investors and then uh if you want to get in the the administration's good graces, you're gonna you're going to certainly start to direct orders uh toward Intel in addition to your orders to Taiwan semiconductors. So, this is a good thing, not a bad thing, >> right? And you also mentioned Nvidia there, which reports this week. What are investors actually looking out for? Well, look, I mean, Nvidia is a situation where they, you know, have um at the moment uh almost a a monopoly on the chips required to drive AI. The problem is their business model relies on the kindness of strangers and they're only as good as Taiwan Semiconductors capacity to produce, which is limited. So, for a stock that is priced for perfection, uh the the number one thing we're going to need to see is strong guidance. Okay, the the numbers, you know, there have been rumors of them uh backing off on orders for for suppliers for the China China chips. The key is going to be strong guidance for the stock to hold up at these levels.\n\nIntel. And and the fact of the matter is, uh, there's a bottleneck. I mean, uh, Nvidia's revenue growth slowdown uh, in terms of growth rate has not been for lack of demand. it's been for lack of supply. There's only so much allocation that Taiwan Semiconductor can give them. And now with Intel as a player and uh finishing out these fabs and being able to supply in coming years, it's going to be phenomenal for the acceleration of AI globally and productivity and everything else that goes along with it.

Well, look, I mean, Nvidia is a situation where they, you know, have um at the moment uh almost a a monopoly on the chips required to drive AI. The problem is their business model relies on the kindness of strangers and they're only as good as Taiwan Semiconductors capacity to produce, which is limited. So, for a stock that is priced for perfection, uh the the number one thing we're going to need to see is strong guidance. Okay, the the numbers, you know, there have been rumors of them uh backing off on orders for for suppliers for the China China chips. The key is going to be strong guidance for the stock to hold up at these levels. >> Yeah, that would be a great place to live it. Thanks, Tom Hayes of Great Hill Capital. >> And we're back. So uh### MEDIA_APPEARANCE_RECAP\nfinally  want to thank Johan Cherion and Sanchayita Roy for having me in their Reuters article as well as Howard Schneider and an Safer for having me in their Reuters article. Was a busy week.### QUOTES_OF_THE_WEEK\nQuote of the week, growth and value investing are joined at the hip. Um that's from Warren Buffett and that's why you know people think they're growth or value. Um I think if you're a good in value investor it's both because you're modeling the recovery of growth whereas value or deep value where they get stuck in value traps um they they don't pay attention to that. They pay the liquidation value and um exclusively and uh that that usually uh doesn't get them the best results possible. On to the bet next. Ray Dallio, Bridgewwater. The biggest mistake investors make is to believe what happened in the recent p past is likely to persist. They assume that something was a good investment in the recent past is still a good investment. We've talked about the shiny objects. We're seeing what's starting to happen there.### MISCELLANEOUS\nAnd the best thing that can happen to Nvidia is the 18A advanced chips uh in Arizona for Intel start humming out next year. It will be great for uh Intel. It will be good for Nvidia. And uh in the meantime, here's your growth rate. Absolute collapse city. Uh next table, US equity inflows are still dominating. Here's what happened year-to date. uh people have been flowing out of China and China has outperformed the US by 3 to one. 30% on the hang, 10% on the S&P. Uh and it's just getting started. So, US federal government surplus deficit as a percentage of nominal GDP. Uh that's not really relevant. I love Pollson stuff, but um the name of the game now is every $300 billion is 1% of GD uh is is a 1% improvement in the deficit. So we're at about 500600 billion of um tariff revenue proforma. So that's 2% that takes us to 3 negative 3.7% deficit which is in line with the last 50-year average. And then you add on top of that um savings in interest. If we lower rates by 100 basis points over the next year, that's another 300 billion. That takes you to like a trillion dollars of savings, which means you're at 3% deficit, which is the best deficit we've had in a long, long time, fiscal responsibility. So, it's coming along. Here you go. Um, by the way, that data on uh Nvidia was from a website called billionairesportfolio.com.

Ryan Air expects Boeing to boost 737 output to 42 per month by October. Nvidia forecast decelerating growth after two-year AI boom. Fed opens the floodgate. Green light for rotation heading into the second half of 2025. Our number one theme and something we had long been pounding the table on was housing. With sentiment at multi-year lows, we laid out our thesis and highlighted the catalyst. A 4 million plus unit housing shortage after more than a decade of underbuilding. 70 plus million millennials entering prime family formation years. Favorable policies and regulations and easing mortgage rates on the horizon. Rather than owning the waring fashions of homebuilders trapped in a race to the bottom of incentive wars, we played the theme with a handful of levered arms dealers, two of which we will touch on later. Fast forward to today, all of those catalysts remain firmly intact. The only change is that Fed and J. Powell have done a complete about face, effectively giving the sector a green light. For months, we've argued that the Fed has been well over 100 basis points too restrictive, hurting housing, and forcing millions of millennials to put their lives on hold.\n\nthe Fed is all but guaranteed a September cut. If the report comes in significantly weaker than expected, a 50 basis point move would not shock us. The market has clearly priced this in with 88.2% odds of a September cut, 85.4 4% odds of two cuts by December. Whether we get one, two, or three cuts this year, anyone's guess is as good as mine. What really matters is the Fed is\n\n### MACRO_DATA_SLIDES\nfinally  shed the title of too late Powell and embrace a new one, just in time, Powell. Joking aside, the point is that barring an August jobs report that blows expectations out of the water, the Fed is all but guaranteed a September cut. If the report comes in significantly weaker than expected, a 50 basis point move would not shock us. The market has clearly priced this in with 88.2% odds of a September cut, 85.4 4% odds of two cuts by December. Whether we get one, two, or three cuts this year, anyone's guess is as good as mine. What really matters is the Fed is\nfinally  moving in the right direction. We could not be better positioned with rate sensitivity, small caps, and discretionary\n\nfinally getting a bid after being left for dead. The best part is is when it comes to housing specifically, this is just the tip of the iceberg with catalysts such as one, trillions of trapped equity sitting in the sidelines. Two, delevered consumer balance sheets with mortgage debt at 28% of housing market value, the lowest level since the 1950s. Three, a surge in 1.6 million renter households since 2023 directly coincides with the lowest share of firsttime home buyers in US history. These are the millennials trapped on the sidelines waiting to buy starter homes, a trend we expect to quickly reverse. I'd be a seller of apartments, not a buyer, by the way, with the cap rates where they are. uh firsttime home buyers as a percentage of US home buyers there are just a few of the catalyst behind the imminent housing recovery we continue to expect mortgage rates to hit the five handle by year end which should unlock massive supply sparking a buyer market and starter home reviled revival and with its latest move, the Fed has taken the first step towards opening that floodgate.\n### MEDIA_APPEARANCE_RECAP\nQXO update.

QXO's recent earnings report was the first since the Beacon acquisition included two months of combined operations. Revenues of 1.91 billion beat consensus of 1.87 billion while EPS of 11 cents came ahead of 7 cents expectations. More importantly, Jacobs and his team continue to identify opportunities with beacon integration that exceeded initial expectations. Management remains confident in at least doubling legacy beacon Ibida organically while also driving over 500 basis points of margin expansion. Early signs of the Jacobs Midas touch are already visible with adjusted Ebida margins of 10.7% running well ahead of the 2005 pre-acquisition consensus of 9.8%. For those concerned about QXO walking away from the GMS deal and Lowe's 8.8 billion FBM acquisition, it's important to burden ourselves with the facts. At the end of the day, this is an 800 billion industry with over 7,000 distributors across North America, making it one of the most fragmented markets out there.\n\ngetting the recognition it deserves. The only difference is we are already closing in on a double from our cost basis while the rest of Wall Street is just catching on. Now they're all taking price targets up to as high as $50. Uh nowhere to be found at 12. Better late than never as we continue to believe this story is still in the very first inning. Here's a great article from Barrens last week making the case for QXO. Who wrote this by the way? Okay. Uh Q2 earnings breakdown. QXO's recent earnings report was the first since the Beacon acquisition included two months of combined operations. Revenues of 1.91 billion beat consensus of 1.87 billion while EPS of 11 cents came ahead of 7 cents expectations. More importantly, Jacobs and his team continue to identify opportunities with beacon integration that exceeded initial expectations. Management remains confident in at least doubling legacy beacon Ibida organically while also driving over 500 basis points of margin expansion. Early signs of the Jacobs Midas touch are already visible with adjusted Ebida margins of 10.7% running well ahead of the 2005 pre-acquisition consensus of 9.8%.

At the end of the day, this is an 800 billion industry with over 7,000 distributors across North America, making it one of the most fragmented markets out there. translation. There is  no shortage of attractive acquisition targets, both public and private, for QXO. What matters far more is staying disciplined on price. And Brad Jacobs has made a career out of never overpaying. Unlike most operators, he actually cares about the IC in ROIC, return on invested capital. No matter how good you are at finding efficiencies and growing businesses, if you pay too much on the front end, it's nearly impossible to generate superior returns. That principle is rare in today's market and it's exactly why we want what we want to see from GX uh from QXO. QXO remains well on track to becoming a $50 billion powerhouse. I think it's going to be 100 uh over the next decade. Beacon accounts for the first 10 billion and Jacobs accomplish that in the first year. Some have patience. Park this one in the filing cabinet and let Brad Jacobs have some patience. Park this one in the filing cabinet and let Brad Jacobs work his magic. So that's that Generrack update. Look at this free cash flow off the charts, ladies and gentlemen. Last time you had free cash flow this high, you had a four$45 $500 stock, $450 stock. It's still at 200 uh even though it's doubled in the last few months. Yeeha. Another one of our favorite picks and shovel plays on the housing recovery is Gener, or as we like to call it, the Kleenex of generators. This sleepy name turned out to be a textbook example of a quote we live by at Great Hill Capital. great great investment opportunities come around when excellent companies are surrounded by unusual circumstances that cause the stock price to be misappraised. Gener found itself caught way off sides following a once in a century pandemic event. The ensuing deto cycle drove inventories up 85% from 2021 to 2022 leading to multiple quarters of negative free cash flow and a gross margin collapse of over 500 basis points sending the stock down more than 80%. That's when Gener came across our desk and quickly got our attention through the noise and temporary overhang. We saw a high-quality market leader with nearly 80% market share, strong normalized earnings, a solid balance sheet, a shareholder friendly management team with skin in the game, and secular tailwinds that weren't going anywhere. That gave us all the confidence we needed to build a solidsized position. Management quickly got to work on the turnaround, spending the next few quarters cleaning up inventories, which were back to normalized levels by the end of 2024. As expected, gross margins sharply rebounded from a trough of just 33% to over 39% while free cash flow inflected and hit a record high of 605 million with another strong year of 400 plus million on deck for 2025. Needless to say, the turnaround has played out exactly as we expected, rewarding us with a solid double in just a few years. The good news is that when you buy a great business at great prices, you tend to get upside surprises along the way. This past quarter, Generrack delivered exactly that, anni announcing its entry into the megawatt generator market for AI and data centers along with guidance for the space, but that frankly blew us away. Here are a few lines from the earnings call that put it into perspective. Quote, I think this is by far and away one of the biggest needlemoving opportunities that I've seen in my time here in my three decades with the company. quote again, like I said, I don't I've never seen something that can move the needle like this. I think if we do things the right way, this part of our business, the data center uh generators, FYI, uh which has always been a good solid business, is over a call it $ 1.5 billion opportunity. That's the size of the entire CNI products part of our business. That's something that can grow dramatically in the next several years. We could be in a situation in several years where CNI products are larger than the entire rest of the company. Because of this, some quick back of the envelope math shows the scale of the opportunity for CNI to surpass the rest of the company revenues would need to reach at least $3 billion for the segment. If you assign zero growth to the rest of the business during that time, which is low probability with housing just turning up, meaning the breadandbut residential business suddenly flat lines along with your uh energy storage, etc., total revenues would still reach $6 billion or roughly 40% above 2024 levels. The way I see it, this past quarter was a complete gamecher for Generrack. What began as a sleepy contrarian Dtock restock turnaround has morphed into an AI and data center play for us. That is the whipped cream on and cherry on top. Here's everything you need to know about Gener Lights Out quarter. You're going to have to read this on your own. We underlined all the important parts for you. Um there's a lot there and the 10 key points I would definitely go through with the revenue growth earnings uh megawatt generators CNI home standby ecob is now turning cash flow positive or profitable by the end of the year cash flow from operations buybacks everything you want to know all right there laid out for you we did the work for you moving on let's go to fear and greed again greedy Not crazy but greedy.

First one comes from Evan M. Thoughts on U-Haul? UH rates coming down, people moving. All right, like the thesis. Let's just see if I like the price. Uh, no. There they're so negative cash flow negative eroders of nah not for me. I don't even if the theme is right they just run it into the ground so far. Sam Gaffer, thanks for all you do. As far as I'm concerned, they should just give you the Nobel Peace Ride. I don't know about that. Uh great job. Get to the point. We don't have an hour here. Uh CPS branch of have uh no I wouldn't play the warrants. You either play it as is or not. Barry Kimbro uh natural teacher done well in Generrack Advanced Baba Disney are you okay so Barry thank you for the compliment here I'm not going to answer six stocks from one person so I'll take Lulu we've covered um LVMH not for me good company. Uh, I'll take a quick look at Abco, but I think you're most right on Humera. A GCO. No, I'm not buying that up here. Um, Hum. I think this is going to Humanana. That's going to be a good I like it. I like it. I've looked at it. I like it. Um, good one. Next. Barat Sha. Okay. Yes, you can come in October 1st. Um, thank you for that. Del, uh, Divas Lung, Serupa Therapeutics. I don't buy individual biotech companies. We have a basket. Um, so I'm going to just stick to that. But let me just see if there's anything telling here. No, there's still negative cash flow. I have no edge on the drugs. So, skip that. Anand uh million dollars in October. Thank you. We will love to have you Anand in in October when we open up to the smaller accounts. Uh what's the best book to learn about real estate? I have no idea. Start with Rich Dad Poor Dad and go from there. Um Uh, okay. So, he says, \"I know you don't invest take country risk, uh, DQ Energy, New Energy Corp. Uh, I would not invest in any other stocks other than Alibaba and maybe 10-centent in China because the numbers are good until they're not. So, you're just gambling that it's going to prove to not be a fraud and that's like a coin flip in China.\" So, hate to say it, negative free cash flow. Look, it's a trading vehicle. If you want to gamble, have at it. But I wouldn't buy it as a business. Would you put 100% of your net worth if JP Morgan was going to finance the debt? You would be the equity with 100% of your net worth. Would you put that in DQ Energy in China? The answer is no. Don't even buy a share. Like this is how people blow up and never get rich. Tim D, it's called greed and short-term thinking. Herz HTZ, by the way, I love the question. Thank you for asking it. I think you helped a lot of people by doing so. And welcome to the podcast. Glad to um grateful to have you. All right, next. Herz, no, not interested. Aman's buying. Who cares? Good for him. I'm sure he'll make money. I'm not going to participate. Casey Hughes, uh, thanks for both the breath and depth of your perspective in the podcast, all the media interviews. If you were still playing poker with Ray, I I never played poker with Ray Dia. I played poker with the his CIO, Greg Jansen, for 10 years. Uh, what do you think he would tell you? Why Bridgewwater exited their position in Baba earlier this month? I could care less. They've been exiting and entering at the exact wrong times for five years. So, uh, no opinion there. And they don't do fundamental analysis. They trade on algorithms based on who the hell knows what. It's not like they're not reading 10Ks and understanding the business. And the they they're global macro. They buy a basket of equities when they want risk on. They sell a basket of equities when they want risk off. They buy a basket when they want international exposure. sell a basket and people interpret it like they're stock pickers. They they have no clue as to what the underlying business is. They're they're they're expressing a macro view um with baskets. So, you're making wrong assumptions on the basis of uh of of what you're seeing in their filings. Greetings from Ireland. Keep up the good work. Uh, okay. So, he's saying Etsy sold shares. They sold like a few hund They It wasn't even First off, no. The business is generating free cash flow. Second off, people sell for a million reasons. They only buy for one. They're not selling like Palunteer is selling. They're selling hundreds of thousands. They're not selling tens of millions. Okay? So, you don't know if they have to buy a house. You don't know if they uh it could be a million things. Maybe they're going to get fired and they know it. So, the next guy will come on. That would be great. But um no, that has zero bearing on my fundamental analysis unless it's excessive and the valuations are high. Valuations are low. So if they want to sell in the hole, I'll I'll buy them from them. A jeep Alcandon, are you happy with the Canada Goose vest you bought last year? Thinking of getting one for the upcoming winter.

Eric Flame. Uh, how do you search your investment ideas through sellside research? No, I never really read much sellside research uh other than the macro stuff. Um, industry network. No, no, I'm an independent thinker. I mean, that's the bottom line is like I I don't look for confirmation from other investors. Like, if they're already doing it, I probably missed it. So, I'm I have a framework. I like great quality companies that are generating cash that are temporarily impaired in price. So, I look for things that are down and then I try to come up with 10 reasons not to buy it. And if I can't come up with any good reasons, then I start to buy it. And that's that's the way it works. Always invert Charlie Mer. Um, Bees are homes and Excel. I don't like the producers of homes. I like the BZH. All right, you're probably fine with that one. Uh, Excel.

I just hate those businesses because the polic you know, you have a policy headwind and you have negative free cash flow. So, let's just take a look. Yeah, it's starting to turn. Revenues are crashed. Maybe it's turning, maybe it's not. Do a ton of work, but I m I It's not I think it's going to work, but I don't want to be involved. Let's put it that way.

So, you're going to have to do a ton of work with the calls and uh understanding what their promises for a better mñana are. But so far, it's not showing in their numbers. So, for me, it's a pass. But I do kind of this furniture housing theme is going to work and that, you know, that has to do with rates. Uh docu I don't know. docu I think eventually. Doesn't this get uh displaced by Ethereum people? I don't know. I mean, I've looked at this one a million times. I I don't know like other than the fact that everyone uses it and it has a little brand equity. I don't know what they do special that can't be replicated five ways from Sunday. I think they were just first movers and everything's kind of flattening out. I think your instinct is right there, Max. It's not for me, but I think you're probably generally in the right direction. I just wouldn't risk any money on it. Uh, check out Toast Software Company payments. It's a growth company with, you know, how much is priced in? I don't know. Let's see. 250 million IBIDA trading at $24 billion for a commodity payment service for restaurants. So 100 times trailing earnings 43 times forward and what were the sales enterprise value of sales? What's the expected growth rate on the earnings? So at least we can understand why people are willing to pay up for it [Music] 26%. It's trading up 40 times. So two peg I mean yeah if they keep executing perfectly you might make some money but it's not for me. I I can't guess the f I'm not a guess the future kind of guy. Cameron Franco thoughts on IBA again a biotech? No, we don't buy individual biotechs. We buy basket XBI we own. I have no edge here. Free cash flow is still negative. revenues are climbing, but no thank you. All right, let's try uh Oh, this is a great question, guys. Let me just see. I want to end with that question. Well, now let's see. What do you think about leverage? What if one runs a diversified port portfolio of like 15 names, but with like two times or three times or even five time leverage spread evenly? Would that make the risk of blowing up negligible? Um, this is a surefire way to be wearing a Walmart apron inside of 36 months because you're going to blow up your account and everything you've ever worked for. Low to no leverage. Do your work. If you're smart, you'll make outsized returns without material leverage. And if you're dumb, find another business. I mean, it's that simple. If you need leverage to make returns, you're guaranteed to blow up. So, I would uh hard pass on that, Jimmy Jones. But good question. I think you saved a lot of people. Could you look at Country Barrel, Old Country Store, Cracker Barrel? Uh, yeah, I have looked at it because they wanted me to talk about it. I would say the current CEO did a good job at Taco Bell International. their core problems. Uh, and I'm taking this from Marcus Lamonus who I was asking during the breaks. Uh, their inventory management in the stores are is bad and their food quality has gone down. But those are two things can turn. Uh, if it got back into the 40s, I'd probably be a buyer. It's kind of run away a little bit here. Uh, it's going to be a three to five year turnaround in my view, but it's it's kind of uh it's it's crossed my radar a few times in the last few months. I've done nothing with it. I'm not inclined to do anything with it, but it's on the radar. And that's that. So,\n\nCameron Franco thoughts on IBA again a biotech?

Number two, that business is growing triple digits every quarter for the last seven consecutive quarters, and their international commerce business is growing at about 30%. >> So, what is your answer when we see that the Dow\n\n### MEDIA_APPEARANCE_RECAP\n\n\n I think what the administration is trying to do is those critically important areas that we have to have for national security. Minerals that are not able to necessarily stand on their own perfectly at the moment that we need them and to invest in the future. That's where the government steps in to make us competitive with the stuff that China's subsidizing that's competing with us. In the case of Loheed Martin, they are perfectly fine on their own. They will continue to do great things, innovate, and the government needs them. They will continue to get 97%. \n### MEDIA_APPEARANCE_RECAP\nEverybody's waiting for Nvidia. Uh Tom Hayes is joining us this morning to take us through this. Let's talk Nvidia. Their report after the market closes this afternoon. Uh Nvidia, if it moves down, just supposing it did. If if Nvidia took the market down and took Nvidia down, >> it would be a dip. Would you buy the dip? >> You do want to buy these dips, but you want to be selective. St. We've got a lot of tailwinds. >> You can't select the dip you're going to take. >> Well, you got to buy the the right stock. So, would I chase the Mag 7? Would I chase Nvidia off 5%? No, I wouldn't. I'd be buying the lagards that are going to benefit from lower rates. I'd be buying small caps. I'd be buying the unmagnificent 493 that are going to refinance their debt at lower rates and take off and be a tailwind for the economy. I'd buy the ones that are going to benefit from reshoring and Trump policies. That's where I'd be focused. The things that haven't quite moved. Why? because managers are still behind their benchmarks and they got to play catch-up. Dips will be bought. \nOkay. Housing, but don't buy the builders. Their margins are going to go down as the production goes up. Buy the suppliers. Building suppliers like QXO, Stanley Black & Decker, GenerRack has had this huge run. Uh that's going to continue. autos auto and don't buy the producers buy the suppliers the Cooper standards of the worlds that's supply because volumes are going to go up we've got lowcost energy we got steel we've got all the components incentives going in and the average car on the road 13.5 years USA is going to benefit okay 88 cuts around the world US zero cuts international stocks are outperforming US by 10% this year because of that money goes where it's treated best we start cutting that money is going to come back \nWhich energy stocks would you be buying now? >> Okay. Well, it's time to put Don Kyote and his windmills back in the barn. We like natural gas. Okay. Comtock Resources. Jerry Jones, the owner of the Dallas Cowboys, owns 75% of the stock. Huge play in the Hannesville shale. Unlimited cheap energy. Second one we like is National Oil Well, Varco, N OV. They do onshore and offshore drilling, uh production, servicing. They're the number one player. Great balance sheet. We love these two energy plays and they're not so sensitive to the price of crude particularly national oil wellco. So we love that to get what we need with AI and all the demand. These are the two stocks. \nHis reshoring plan is working. If you look at US AutoSAR, sell through, it's oscillated between 18 million units and 15 million units a year for the last 45 years. When he came into office, we were touching on 15 million units, 45 year lows. We're now getting close to 16. We're going to go back up to 18. What do you need for cars? You need lowcost energy. You need steel. You need domestic production. It's just beginning. He's 100% right. And then you need lower rates for the demand to to kick in. We're going to get that in the next couple of quarters. \nThen I want to thank um again uh Christian Dagger over at the at Barney and Co. want to thank Mel Montana for having me on NYC live down at the New York Stock Exchange.\nJoining me now is Tom Hayes, chairman and managing member of Grey Hill Capital. Tom, welcome to NYC Live. >> Thanks for having me, Ashley. Glad to be here. \nYeah, unquestionably. I mean what uh Chair Powell did on Friday was he acknowledged the dual mandate. We've been seeing cracks in the labor market, weakening of the labor market. Even their own uh uh summary of economic projections was projecting 1.4% real GDP. So it's about time that they stop focusing on inflation, which may they acknowledge may have a shortterm bump due to tariffs, but then roll over and focus on the labor market. They're over a 100 basis points too restrictive. Everyone knows it. It's really hurt the housing market. It's really hurt people trying to buy a starter home. So, this is very positive. Not only 84% of a cut in September, but an 84% of two cuts by December. So, that's very, very positive for the markets. \nI know we get some inflation numbers on Friday, but I think more important than that is going to be the employment numbers. the jobs report the first Friday in September is going to be the most important thing. Uh if that shows continued weakening, it's a guaranteed lock for the cut. Maybe even 50 basis points if if the jobs uh report shows some weakness. As far as the inflation number, I think that'll have a lower weight this time around uh than than the uh than the employment numbers. \nWell, I mean the bar was low. 4.8% earnings growth expected before we started. Came in 11.8%. So, it's not just that we beat and all the numbers were great. The most important thing was the guidance. And what we're seeing is for 2026 estimates have gone way up. Okay, they were down as low as $295 a share in earnings up to 303 as of the end of this earning season, which takes the multiple down a little lower. companies are getting confident. They're up upgrading their guidance and that's the formula for good things to happen.\n\n### MEDIA_APPEARANCE_RECAP\nmarkets. >> Anything else uh the Fed will be watching uh most closely for, you know, before its next policy meeting in September. >> I know. I know we get some inflation numbers on Friday, but I think more important than that is going to be the employment numbers. the jobs report the first Friday in September is going to be the most important thing. Uh if that shows continued weakening, it's a guaranteed lock for the cut. Maybe even 50 basis points if if the jobs uh report shows some weakness. As far as the inflation number, I think that'll have a lower weight this time around uh than than the uh than the employment numbers. >> So earning season is wrapping up. This is the third straight quarter of double digit double digits earnings growth. What is your takeaway from this earnings season? >> Well, I mean the bar was low. 4.8% earnings growth expected before we started. Came in 11.8%. So, it's not just that we beat and all the numbers were great. The most important thing was the guidance. And what we're seeing is for 2026 estimates have gone way up. Okay, they were down as low as $295 a share in earnings up to 303 as of the end of this earning season, which takes the multiple down a little lower. companies are getting confident. They're up upgrading their guidance and that's the formula for good things to happen. >> So investors who bought the dip in April um you know proved to be successful. What is your guidance for investors for the rest of 2025? >> Okay. Well, we've been pounding the table bullish the last few months. So we we are smiling so wide we could eat a banana sideways. However, Ashley, the the key thing here is  the markets moved a long way in a short period of time. So I think if you're just chasing the indices expecting a lot more, you might be a little bit disappointed because that's basically a MAG7 index. MAG 7 earnings growth has decelerated. So it was 33% last year. It's down this quarter. It's going to be possibly below 10% for the first time and the multiple hasn't contracted. Conversely, unmnificent 493 international small cap, all the lagards. That's the new catch-up trade because managers got caught flat-footed. Most of them were sellers in the hole, not buyers. the net $1 trillion of equities got sold on uh April 7th be you know right around liberation day. So they still have to play catch-up. They're not going to chase the mag seven. They're going to buy those things where they think they can get out performance into year end to hopefully beat their benchmarks and keep their jobs. So uh so that's where I would be focused. Small caps, midcaps, value versus growth, some international and that's that's where we're uh looking for opportunities. >> And anything else you're advising clients on right now? I think that um you have to be we're we're very constructive on the markets in the economy, but we need to be very very selective on where we allocate new capital because there are still tremendous opportunities even after the 30% rally off the lows. Um but you you have to pick the right ones and that's where you're going to get outperformance into year end in the lag laggered uh stocks and in the catch-up trade for for managers. And just to shift back to earnings, we have a pair of notable\n\n### MISCELLANEOUS\nmarkets moved a long way in a short period of time.

NYC listed Alibaba on Friday. What should investors be looking for? >> Um, as a major holder of Alibaba for a couple of years, brought our bases down to $82. I think Alibaba is going to knock shoot the lights out again. Uh, they're So, for for those who don't know, it's like the Amazon uh of uh of China. They've got 40% of the e-commerce market. It's a toll taker on the middle class. They got 40% of the cloud business. Think Amazon web services and growing. They're the cheapest AI play in the world. They have stakes in pretty much every AI startup in China. They've got the fastest large language models in in the Quen offerings. And that business, their AI products have grown triple digits every quarter for the last seven quarters. And I think we're going to see the same thing this quarter. So you got 20% expected earnings growth next year with Alibaba trading at about 13 times earnings. You can't get that anywhere in the United States. And then President Trump keeps saying, \"I'm going to meet with Xi and China and etc. We're going to shake hands.\" The minute they shake hands, this stock is going to be up so so big because Chinese stocks have outperformed US stocks. Most people don't know this this year. Hang's up 30%, S&P is up 10%. So that's that's where I'd be focused on. Uh personally as it relates to Nvidia earnings are probably going to be good. Okay, we know that the demand is there. The question is the supply and their guidance looking forward. It is uh priced for really good things to happen. So if any aspect of the guidance is less than expected or slightly weak, you could have a little bit of short-term turbulence, but it's a juggernaut. And the big play that's going to help Nvidia that no one's paying attention to is Intel because Nvidia's sales growth rate has slowed down dramatically. Not due to lack of demand, lack of supply. Taiwan semiconductor can only give them so much allocation. If we stand up Intel to produce these advanced chips, which now the government has backstopped, uh that's going to be really really good for Nvidia as well as Intel.\n### MEDIA_APPEARANCE_RECAP\nUS President Donald Trump buying a 10% stake in Intel. And today he's boasted about the government's stake, uh saying he's determined to do similar deals. What exactly does this mean? Well, I think this is the best news we've heard in a while, Bissy. I I think you needed to see the government backs stop for Intel. It's a signal to the world that Intel is here to stay. And it is a national security matter. We need to produce chips in the US. Intel Intel is furthest along. They're at the 10 yard line. Uh and they needed this boost to get into the end zone and and spike the football. So I think that while Kevin Hasset this morning said that, you know, the government is not going to push people to buy Intel chips, I think if you want to curry favor with the US government now, uh, as a major stakeholder in Intel, you're going to direct some of your orders to Intel. And and the fact of the matter is, uh, there's a bottleneck. I mean, uh, Nvidia's revenue growth slowdown uh, in terms of growth rate has not been for lack of demand. it's been for lack of supply. There's only so much allocation that Taiwan Semiconductor can give them. And now with Intel as a player and uh finishing out these fabs and being able to supply in coming years, it's going to be phenomenal for the acceleration of AI globally and productivity and everything else that goes along with it. And then you couple that with um it also has encouraged further investors. We saw Masiohi Sun uh put in for SoftBank $2 billion last week. Why was it timed to last week? No one was racing to give Intel money uh until there were rumors that the government was stepping in and all of a sudden SoftBank stepped in behind them. I think we're going to see more investors and then uh if you want to get in the the administration's good graces, you're gonna you're going to certainly start to direct orders uh toward Intel in addition to your orders to Taiwan semiconductors. So, this is a good thing, not a bad thing, >> right? And you also mentioned Nvidia there, which reports this week. What are investors actually looking out for? Well, look, I mean, Nvidia is a situation where they, you know, have um at the moment uh almost a a monopoly on the chips required to drive AI. The problem is their business model relies on the kindness of strangers and they're only as good as Taiwan Semiconductors capacity to produce, which is limited. So, for a stock that is priced for perfection, uh the the number one thing we're going to need to see is strong guidance. Okay, the the numbers, you know, there have been rumors of them uh backing off on orders for for suppliers for the China China chips. The key is going to be strong guidance for the stock to hold up at these levels.\n\nIntel. And and the fact of the matter is, uh, there's a bottleneck.

So uh### MEDIA_APPEARANCE_RECAP\nfinally  want to thank Johan Cherion and Sanchayita Roy for having me in their Reuters article as well as Howard Schneider and an Safer for having me in their Reuters article. Was a busy week.### QUOTES_OF_THE_WEEK\nQuote of the week, growth and value investing are joined at the hip. Um that's from Warren Buffett and that's why you know people think they're growth or value. Um I think if you're a good in value investor it's both because you're modeling the recovery of growth whereas value or deep value where they get stuck in value traps um they they don't pay attention to that. They pay the liquidation value and um exclusively and uh that that usually uh doesn't get them the best results possible. On to the bet next. Ray Dallio, Bridgewwater. The biggest mistake investors make is to believe what happened in the recent p past is likely to persist. They assume that something was a good investment in the recent past is still a good investment. We've talked about the shiny objects. We're seeing what's starting to happen there.### MISCELLANEOUS\nAnd the best thing that can happen to Nvidia is the 18A advanced chips uh in Arizona for Intel start humming out next year. It will be great for uh Intel. It will be good for Nvidia. And uh in the meantime, here's your growth rate. Absolute collapse city. Uh next table, US equity inflows are still dominating. Here's what happened year-to date. uh people have been flowing out of China and China has outperformed the US by 3 to one. 30% on the hang, 10% on the S&P. Uh and it's just getting started. So, US federal government surplus deficit as a percentage of nominal GDP. Uh that's not really relevant. I love Pollson stuff, but um the name of the game now is every $300 billion is 1% of GD uh is is a 1% improvement in the deficit. So we're at about 500600 billion of um tariff revenue proforma. So that's 2% that takes us to 3 negative 3.7% deficit which is in line with the last 50-year average. And then you add on top of that um savings in interest. If we lower rates by 100 basis points over the next year, that's another 300 billion. That takes you to like a trillion dollars of savings, which means you're at 3% deficit, which is the best deficit we've had in a long, long time, fiscal responsibility. So, it's coming along. Here you go. Um, by the way, that data on uh Nvidia was from a website called billionairesportfolio.com. Huge shout out for that.### TECHNICAL_CHARTS\nNext then we've got um M2 Money Supply going back to 6% trend growth. Uh, so it had a big dip in 2022. Now it's starting to turn back up.

The best jockey in the business, Brad Jacobs. Brad Jacobs track record speaks for itself. An investment in XPO when he got involved would have been a 50 bagger. United Rentals would have been closer to a 200 bagger. Taken together, investing alongside Jacobs across his companies would have generated more than a 300x bagger. Simply put, Brad Jacobs is in a league of his own when it comes to consistently creating shareholder value at scale. So, when Jacobs spots an industry ripe for disruption, you pay attention.

Green light for rotation heading into the second half of 2025. Our number one theme and something we had long been pounding the table on was housing. With sentiment at multi-year lows, we laid out our thesis and highlighted the catalyst. A 4 million plus unit housing shortage after more than a decade of underbuilding. 70 plus million millennials entering prime family formation years. Favorable policies and regulations and easing mortgage rates on the horizon. Rather than owning the waring fashions of homebuilders trapped in a race to the bottom of incentive wars, we played the theme with a handful of levered arms dealers, two of which we will touch on later. Fast forward to today, all of those catalysts remain firmly intact. The only change is that Fed and J. Powell have done a complete about face, effectively giving the sector a green light. For months, we've argued that the Fed has been well over 100 basis points too restrictive, hurting housing, and forcing millions of millennials to put their lives on hold.",

So Nvidia's revenue growth rate has decelerated not for lack of demand but for lack of supply. They only get a limited allocation from Taiwan Semiconductor. They need excess capacity of production of advanced chips. And this $10 billion deal the 18A node in Arizona is going to be critical because all the designers what people don't realize that their business models rely on the kindness of strangers. Okay? If Taiwan semiconductor ceases to exist, Nvidia ceases to exist. So we need Intel to have that advanced production and that's that is the dark horse in the semiconductor play and uh Nvidia watch the guidance.

And now we've got the existential risk off the table. Government backs stop. We're going to the promised land. >> I don't think that was the question, though. Are you happy that the government's in the deal, not the leader? >> Yes, I am happy that the government's in the deal because the implicit uh assumption if I'm a chip designer and I want access uh to or an ear in Washington and I'm buying chips from Intel when I could buy them from Taiwan Semiconductor. I could buy them in theory from Huawei, which is not going to happen, or Samsung. But I'm putting my orders with Intel and I say, \"Hey, I want a meeting. I need additional help. We need extra production.\" They're going to take that meeting if I'm showing that I'm that I'm a consumer. And I love what Trump said when he was excited when Intel's stock price is going up because it means America is getting richer because we as the taxpayers own 10% of the company. >> The identification of the supply chain boost for Nvidia out of Intel, I think, is the key there. I think that that honestly talk I don't think we win. Well, I I think there's something to be said there, but if you remember during World War II, we took over all the factories to develop weapons. Whether you were making furniture, whether you were making what, you started making weapons for the war effort. Um I I think we're in a catch 22 in in the you know, not giving China our chips because they were very dependent on us up until about 2 3 years ago. They needed everything we could sell them they would take. And now because they've been forced to their technology advancement has I mean if you look at Alibaba's uh um uh large language models are beating on many metrics against chat GPT against others. So as we move into inference believe it or not that edge in advantage uh uh is less important as it is in the large language models you just need huge amount of chip power and those are commodity chips. So, I think there are unintended consequences of government involvement in that. China now has been forced to up their chip game because they can't get what they want. And uh and I think long term, I liked it better when they were dependent on us and we could show \n### MISCELLANEOUS\nBy the way, a big holding of ours uh we were buyers in the low 80s is Disney.

I mean, that's a 50% move off the lows. >> And it's still down damn near 100%. But they almost destroyed it. But the point is these things linger. Yeah. How long has it lingered though? It's lingering. A long time. \n### FEATURED_COMPANY_DEEP_DIVES\n\n\n### MISCELLANEOUS\nmarkets moved a long way in a short period of time. So I think if you're just chasing the indices expecting a lot more, you might be a little bit disappointed because that's basically a MAG7 index. MAG 7 earnings growth has decelerated. So it was 33% last year. It's down this quarter. It's going to be possibly below 10% for the first time and the multiple hasn't contracted. Conversely, unmnificent 493 international small cap, all the lagards. That's the new catch-up trade because managers got caught flat-footed. Most of them were sellers in the hole, not buyers. the net $1 trillion of equities got sold on uh April 7th be you know right around liberation day. So they still have to play catch-up. They're not going to chase the mag seven. They're going to buy those things where they think they can get out performance into year end to hopefully beat their benchmarks and keep their jobs. So uh so that's where I would be focused. Small caps, midcaps, value versus growth, some international and that's that's where we're uh looking for opportunities. \n### FEATURED_COMPANY_DEEP_DIVES\nNvidia is reporting on Wednesday. NYC listed Alibaba on Friday. What should investors be looking for? >> Um, as a major holder of Alibaba for a couple of years, brought our bases down to $82. I think Alibaba is going to knock shoot the lights out again. Uh, they're So, for for those who don't know, it's like the Amazon uh of uh of China. They've got 40% of the e-commerce market. It's a toll taker on the middle class. They got 40% of the cloud business. Think Amazon web services and growing. They're the cheapest AI play in the world. They have stakes in pretty much every AI startup in China. They've got the fastest large language models in in the Quen offerings. And that business, their AI products have grown triple digits every quarter for the last seven quarters. And I think we're going to see the same thing this quarter. So you got 20% expected earnings growth next year with Alibaba trading at about 13 times earnings. You can't get that anywhere in the United States. And then President Trump keeps saying, \"I'm going to meet with Xi and China and etc. We're going to shake hands.\" The minute they shake hands, this stock is going to be up so so big because Chinese stocks have outperformed US stocks. Most people don't know this this year. Hang's up 30%, S&P is up 10%. So that's that's where I'd be focused on. Uh personally as it relates to Nvidia earnings are probably going to be good. Okay, we know that the demand is there. The question is the supply and their guidance looking forward. It is uh priced for really good things to happen. So if any aspect of the guidance is less than expected or slightly weak, you could have a little bit of short-term turbulence, but it's a juggernaut. And the big play that's going to help Nvidia that no one's paying attention to is Intel because Nvidia's sales growth rate has slowed down dramatically. Not due to lack of demand, lack of supply. Taiwan semiconductor can only give them so much allocation. If we stand up Intel to produce these advanced chips, which now the government has backstopped, uh that's going to be really really good for Nvidia as well as Intel.\n### MEDIA_APPEARANCE_RECAP\nUS President Donald Trump buying a 10% stake in Intel. And today he's boasted about the government's stake, uh saying he's determined to do similar deals. What exactly does this mean? Well, I think this is the best news we've heard in a while, Bissy. I I think you needed to see the government backs stop for Intel. It's a signal to the world that Intel is here to stay. And it is a national security matter. We need to produce chips in the US. Intel Intel is furthest along. They're at the 10 yard line. Uh and they needed this boost to get into the end zone and and spike the football. So I think that while Kevin Hasset this morning said that, you know, the government is not going to push people to buy Intel chips, I think if you want to curry favor with the US government now, uh, as a major stakeholder in Intel, you're going to direct some of your orders to Intel. And and the fact of the matter is, uh, there's a bottleneck. I mean, uh, Nvidia's revenue growth slowdown uh, in terms of growth rate has not been for lack of demand. it's been for lack of supply. There's only so much allocation that Taiwan Semiconductor can give them. And now with Intel as a player and uh finishing out these fabs and being able to supply in coming years, it's going to be phenomenal for the acceleration of AI globally and productivity and everything else that goes along with it. And then you couple that with um it also has encouraged further investors. We saw Masiohi Sun uh put in for SoftBank $2 billion last week. Why was it timed to last week? No one was racing to give Intel money uh until there were rumors that the government was stepping in and all of a sudden SoftBank stepped in behind them. I think we're going to see more investors and then uh if you want to get in the the administration's good graces, you're gonna you're going to certainly start to direct orders uh toward Intel in addition to your orders to Taiwan semiconductors. So, this is a good thing, not a bad thing, >> right? And you also mentioned Nvidia there, which reports this week. What are investors actually looking out for? Well, look, I mean, Nvidia is a situation where they, you know, have um at the moment uh almost a a monopoly on the chips required to drive AI. The problem is their business model relies on the kindness of strangers and they're only as good as Taiwan Semiconductors capacity to produce, which is limited. So, for a stock that is priced for perfection, uh the the number one thing we're going to need to see is strong guidance. Okay, the the numbers, you know, there have been rumors of them uh backing off on orders for for suppliers for the China China chips. The key is going to be strong guidance for the stock to hold up at these levels.",

Effective mortgage rate is below 4% is 4% below the current rate. Oh, I see. Because everyone refinanced at the lows. Millennials buying more houses, so that's starting to tick up. Uh 2025, they're finally coming to the table. This is just starting. Housing, you want to be exposed now that rates are coming down. Equal weighted, well, housing and ancillary plays, the building suppliers, not the waring factions, uh, but the suppliers like the QXOs. We'll talk about it in the article. The weight week our equal weighted S&P outperformed over the last two weeks. That's the unmagnificent 493. Lagards catch up. IWM net flows. Last time you had flows like this, you wanted to be a buyer. Small caps, not sellers. Jason Gopford. S&P is on track to close at a record high with more than 90% of issues advancing on the NYC. That's never happened before. There were two times at least 85% of issues advanced. Both kicked off multi-year bull runs. That's very interesting from Jason Gopford. Um, uh, car dealership guy, EV sales are absolutely on fire. Sales were up 26% month-on-month in July, 19.7% yearon-year. We covered some of this with Vney. Look at the KWEB ETF just getting ready to break out in a major way. This implies a measure move, you know, 17 to 30. So 47 first stop up in here, 4750, which would imply an Alibaba somewhere around 160. Uh so let's see what happens with earnings. We need the handshake with Trump and G, but uh maybe we'll get enough boost from earnings. We'll see. Certainly the cuts are going to start to help in September. Got to get through that jobs report the first Friday of September. Small cap versus large cap ratio. Again, buyer time, ladies and gentlemen, not seller time. Um small cap ratio versus real yields. Rates go down. They're going to benefit. They refinance. Weak seasonality is a risk for the equity market in coming months. We've covered this September, October, but since we had the 20% correction, the small dips will be meant to be bought. Uh earnings growth next year 13.6%. Breath we covered equal weight versus S&P turning up. Healthcare valuation should recover as policy certain uncertainty clears. I think Trump said he wanted to lower drug prices by,400 to,500%. I'm not sure how that actually works, but um that's got, you know, the market a little scared this week. That should probably be the tail end. It's kind of like the liberation day for healthcare. Um and uh so we've been in uh topping up on some things like Baxter, etc. Real dollar index again starting a downtrend, long-term multi-year downtrend. Federal debt held by the public as a percentage of GDP. W\n\nQXO update. QXO is up 60% since we discussed it on Fox Business a couple of months ago on April 4th and even more since we first cover it on the podcast. Not only is QXO one of our favorite levered arms dealer plays on housing, it is also a bet on one of, if not the best jockeyies in the business. Brad Jacobs. Brad Jacobs track record speaks for itself. An investment in XPO when he got involved would have been a 50 bagger. United Rentals would have been closer to a 200 bagger. Taken together, investing alongside Jacobs across his companies would have generated more than a 300x bagger. Simply put, Brad Jacobs is in a league of his own when it comes to consistently creating shareholder value at scale. So, when Jacobs spots an industry ripe for disruption, you pay attention. And that's exactly what we see with QXO. His next venture as he aims to build a $50 billion plus powerhouse in the $800 billion building products distribution industry. After laying out the playbook, QXO is finally  getting the recognition it deserves. The only difference is we are already closing in on a double from our cost basis while the rest of Wall Street is just catching on. Now they're all taking price targets up to as high as $50. QXO's recent earnings report was the first since the Beacon acquisition included two months of combined operations. Revenues of 1.91 billion beat consensus of 1.87 billion while EPS of 11 cents came ahead of 7 cents expectations. More importantly, Jacobs and his team continue to identify opportunities with beacon integration that exceeded initial expectations. Management remains confident in at least doubling legacy beacon Ibida organically while also driving over 500 basis points of margin expansion. Early signs of the Jacobs Midas touch are already visible with adjusted Ebida margins of 10.7% running well ahead of the 2005 pre-acquisition consensus of 9.8%. For those concerned about QXO walking away from the GMS deal and Lowe's 8.8 billion FBM acquisition, it's important to burden ourselves with the facts. At the end of the day, this is an 800 billion industry with over 7,000 distributors across North America, making it one of the most fragmented markets out there.",

And uh and I think long term, I liked it better when they were dependent on us and we could show \n### MISCELLANEOUS\nBy the way, a big holding of ours uh we were buyers in the low 80s is Disney. They screwed up the same thing. You know what? They've kind of fixed it. Not perfect. >> They got a long way to go, though. They got a long way from 175 to 117. >> But look, it's up to 120. I mean, that's a 50% move off the lows. >> And it's still down damn near 100%. But they almost destroyed it. But the point is these things linger. Yeah. How long has it lingered though? It's lingering. A long time. \n### FEATURED_COMPANY_DEEP_DIVES\n\n\ninvest in reshoring, invest in the things that are going to really drive Main Street. If you remember his first term, Wall Street did okay, but there was some volatility. Main Street in terms of real wages did a better than ever. Okay? And I think he's he's setting the stage for that to be the case where you're going to see Main Street prosperity. You saw the CB consumer confidence numbers better than expected this morning. You see real GDP now this morning 2.2%. Not bad for Q3. So all of this is positive and it can't just be AI capbacks. We got to build real stuff 100%. \n### MISCELLANEOUS\nFed is here to do its job and only its job and we're going to do it right every time and by the way at the very least where is the announcement this morning she is on leave until we gather the facts\n\n### MISCELLANEOUS\nmarkets moved a long way in a short period of time. So I think if you're just chasing the indices expecting a lot more, you might be a little bit disappointed because that's basically a MAG7 index. MAG 7 earnings growth has decelerated. So it was 33% last year. It's down this quarter. It's going to be possibly below 10% for the first time and the multiple hasn't contracted. Conversely, unmnificent 493 international small cap, all the lagards. That's the new catch-up trade because managers got caught flat-footed. Most of them were sellers in the hole, not buyers. the net $1 trillion of equities got sold on uh April 7th be you know right around liberation day. So they still have to play catch-up. They're not going to chase the mag seven. They're going to buy those things where they think they can get out performance into year end to hopefully beat their benchmarks and keep their jobs. So uh so that's where I would be focused. Small caps, midcaps, value versus growth, some international and that's that's where we're uh looking for opportunities. \n### FEATURED_COMPANY_DEEP_DIVES\nNvidia is reporting on Wednesday. NYC listed Alibaba on Friday. What should investors be looking for? >> Um, as a major holder of Alibaba for a couple of years, brought our bases down to $82. I think Alibaba is going to knock shoot the lights out again. Uh, they're So, for for those who don't know, it's like the Amazon uh of uh of China. They've got 40% of the e-commerce market. It's a toll taker on the middle class. They got 40% of the cloud business. Think Amazon web services and growing. They're the cheapest AI play in the world. They have stakes in pretty much every AI startup in China. They've got the fastest large language models in in the Quen offerings. And that business, their AI products have grown triple digits every quarter for the last seven quarters. And I think we're going to see the same thing this quarter. So you got 20% expected earnings growth next year with Alibaba trading at about 13 times earnings. You can't get that anywhere in the United States. And then President Trump keeps saying, \"I'm going to meet with Xi and China and etc. We're going to shake hands.\" The minute they shake hands, this stock is going to be up so so big because Chinese stocks have outperformed US stocks. Most people don't know this this year. Hang's up 30%, S&P is up 10%. So that's that's where I'd be focused on. Uh personally as it relates to Nvidia earnings are probably going to be good. Okay, we know that the demand is there. The question is the supply and their guidance looking forward. It is uh priced for really good things to happen. So if any aspect of the guidance is less than expected or slightly weak, you could have a little bit of short-term turbulence, but it's a juggernaut. And the big play that's going to help Nvidia that no one's paying attention to is Intel because Nvidia's sales growth rate has slowed down dramatically. Not due to lack of demand, lack of supply. Taiwan semiconductor can only give them so much allocation. If we stand up Intel to produce these advanced chips, which now the government has backstopped, uh that's going to be really really good for Nvidia as well as Intel.\n### MEDIA_APPEARANCE_RECAP\nUS President Donald Trump buying a 10% stake in Intel. And today he's boasted about the government's stake, uh saying he's determined to do similar deals. What exactly does this mean? Well, I think this is the best news we've heard in a while, Bissy. I I think you needed to see the government backs stop for Intel. It's a signal to the world that Intel is here to stay. And it is a national security matter. We need to produce chips in the US. Intel Intel is furthest along. They're at the 10 yard line. Uh and they needed this boost to get into the end zone and and spike the football. So I think that while Kevin Hasset this morning said that, you know, the government is not going to push people to buy Intel chips, I think if you want to curry favor with the US government now, uh, as a major stakeholder in Intel, you're going to direct some of your orders to Intel. And and the fact of the matter is, uh, there's a bottleneck. I mean, uh, Nvidia's revenue growth slowdown uh, in terms of growth rate has not been for lack of demand. it's been for lack of supply. There's only so much allocation that Taiwan Semiconductor can give them. And now with Intel as a player and uh finishing out these fabs and being able to supply in coming years, it's going to be phenomenal for the acceleration of AI globally and productivity and everything else that goes along with it. And then you couple that with um it also has encouraged further investors. We saw Masiohi Sun uh put in for SoftBank $2 billion last week. Why was it timed to last week? No one was racing to give Intel money uh until there were rumors that the government was stepping in and all of a sudden SoftBank stepped in behind them. I think we're going to see more investors and then uh if you want to get in the the administration's good graces, you're gonna you're going to certainly start to direct orders uh toward Intel in addition to your orders to Taiwan semiconductors. So, this is a good thing, not a bad thing, >> right? And you also mentioned Nvidia there, which reports this week. What are investors actually looking out for? Well, look, I mean, Nvidia is a situation where they, you know, have um at the moment uh almost a a monopoly on the chips required to drive AI. The problem is their business model relies on the kindness of strangers and they're only as good as Taiwan Semiconductors capacity to produce, which is limited. So, for a stock that is priced for perfection, uh the the number one thing we're going to need to see is strong guidance. Okay, the the numbers, you know, there have been rumors of them uh backing off on orders for for suppliers for the China China chips. The key is going to be strong guidance for the stock to hold up at these levels.\n\nIntel. And and the fact of the matter is, uh, there's a bottleneck.

If we lower rates by 100 basis points over the next year, that's another 300 billion. That takes you to like a trillion dollars of savings, which means you're at 3% deficit, which is the best deficit we've had in a long, long time, fiscal responsibility. So, it's coming along.

Who wrote this by the way? Okay. Uh Q2 earnings breakdown. QXO's recent earnings report was the first since the Beacon acquisition included two months of combined operations. Revenues of 1.91 billion beat consensus of 1.87 billion while EPS of 11 cents came ahead of 7 cents expectations. More importantly, Jacobs and his team continue to identify opportunities with beacon integration that exceeded initial expectations. Management remains confident in at least doubling legacy beacon Ibida organically while also driving over 500 basis points of margin expansion. Early signs of the Jacobs Midas touch are already visible with adjusted Ebida margins of 10.7% running well ahead of the 2005 pre-acquisition consensus of 9.8%. For those concerned about QXO walking away from the GMS deal and Lowe's 8.8 billion FBM acquisition, it's important to burden ourselves with the facts. At the end of the day, this is an 800 billion industry with over 7,000 distributors across North America, making it one of the most fragmented markets out there. translation. There is  no shortage of attractive acquisition targets, both public and private, for QXO. What matters far more is staying disciplined on price. And Brad Jacobs has made a career out of never overpaying. Unlike most operators, he actually cares about the IC in ROIC, return on invested capital. No matter how good you are at finding efficiencies and growing businesses, if you pay too much on the front end, it's nearly impossible to generate superior returns. That principle is rare in today's market and it's exactly why we want what we want to see from GX uh from QXO. QXO remains well on track to becoming a $50 billion powerhouse. I think it's going to be 100 uh over the next decade. Beacon accounts for the first 10 billion and Jacobs accomplish that in the first year. Some have patience. Park this one in the filing cabinet and let Brad Jacobs have some patience. Park this one in the filing cabinet and let Brad Jacobs work his magic. So that's that Generrack update. Look at this free cash flow off the charts, ladies and gentlemen. Last time you had free cash flow this high, you had a four$45 $500 stock, $450 stock. It's still at 200 uh even though it's doubled in the last few months. Yeeha. Another one of our favorite picks and shovel plays on the housing recovery is Gener, or as we like to call it, the Kleenex of generators. This sleepy name turned out to be a textbook example of a quote we live by at Great Hill Capital. great great investment opportunities come around when excellent companies are surrounded by unusual circumstances that cause the stock price to be misappraised. Gener found itself caught way off sides following a once in a century pandemic event. The ensuing deto cycle drove inventories up 85% from 2021 to 2022 leading to multiple quarters of negative free cash flow and a gross margin collapse of over 500 basis points sending the stock down more than 80%. That's when Gener came across our desk and quickly got our attention through the noise and temporary overhang. We saw a high-quality market leader with nearly 80% market share, strong normalized earnings, a solid balance sheet, a shareholder friendly management team with skin in the game, and secular tailwinds that weren't going anywhere. That gave us all the confidence we needed to build a solidsized position. Management quickly got to work on the turnaround, spending the next few quarters cleaning up inventories, which were back to normalized levels by the end of 2024. As expected, gross margins sharply rebounded from a trough of just 33% to over 39% while free cash flow inflected and hit a record high of 605 million with another strong year of 400 plus million on deck for 2025. Needless to say, the turnaround has played out exactly as we expected, rewarding us with a solid double in just a few years. The good news is that when you buy a great business at great prices, you tend to get upside surprises along the way. This past quarter, Generrack delivered exactly that, anni announcing its entry into the megawatt generator market for AI and data centers along with guidance for the space, but that frankly blew us away. Here are a few lines from the earnings call that put it into perspective. Quote, I think this is by far and away one of the biggest needlemoving opportunities that I've seen in my time here in my three decades with the company. quote again, like I said, I don't I've never seen something that can move the needle like this. I think if we do things the right way, this part of our business, the data center uh generators, FYI, uh which has always been a good solid business, is over a call it $ 1.5 billion opportunity. That's the size of the entire CNI products part of our business. That's something that can grow dramatically in the next several years. We could be in a situation in several years where CNI products are larger than the entire rest of the company. Because of this, some quick back of the envelope math shows the scale of the opportunity for CNI to surpass the rest of the company revenues would need to reach at least $3 billion for the segment. If you assign zero growth to the rest of the business during that time, which is low probability with housing just turning up, meaning the breadandbut residential business suddenly flat lines along with your uh energy storage, etc., total revenues would still reach $6 billion or roughly 40% above 2024 levels. The way I see it, this past quarter was a complete gamecher for Generrack. What began as a sleepy contrarian Dtock restock turnaround has morphed into an AI and data center play for us. That is the whipped cream on and cherry on top. Here's everything you need to know about Gener Lights Out quarter. You're going to have to read this on your own. We underlined all the important parts for you. Um there's a lot there and the 10 key points I would definitely go through with the revenue growth earnings uh megawatt generators CNI home standby ecob is now turning cash flow positive or profitable by the end of the year cash flow from operations buybacks everything you want to know all right there laid out for you we did the work for you moving on let's go to fear and greed again greedy Not crazy but greedy.

We could be in a situation in several years where CNI products are larger than the entire rest of the company. Because of this, some quick back of the envelope math shows the scale of the opportunity for CNI to surpass the rest of the company revenues would need to reach at least $3 billion for the segment. If you assign zero growth to the rest of the business during that time, which is low probability with housing just turning up, meaning the breadandbut residential business suddenly flat lines along with your uh energy storage, etc., total revenues would still reach $6 billion or roughly 40% above 2024 levels.

First one comes from Evan M. Thoughts on U-Haul? UH rates coming down, people moving. All right, like the thesis. Let's just see if I like the price. Uh, no. There they're so negative cash flow negative eroders of nah not for me. I don't even if the theme is right they just run it into the ground so far. Sam Gaffer, thanks for all you do. As far as I'm concerned, they should just give you the Nobel Peace Ride. I don't know about that. Uh great job. Get to the point. We don't have an hour here. Uh CPS branch of have uh no I wouldn't play the warrants. You either play it as is or not. Barry Kimbro uh natural teacher done well in Generrack Advanced Baba Disney are you okay so Barry thank you for the compliment here I'm not going to answer six stocks from one person so I'll take Lulu we've covered um LVMH not for me good company. Uh, I'll take a quick look at Abco, but I think you're most right on Humera. A GCO. No, I'm not buying that up here. Um, Hum. I think this is going to Humanana. That's going to be a good I like it. I like it. I've looked at it. I like it. Um, good one. Next. Barat Sha. Okay. Yes, you can come in October 1st. Um, thank you for that. Del, uh, Divas Lung, Serupa Therapeutics. I don't buy individual biotech companies. We have a basket. Um, so I'm going to just stick to that. But let me just see if there's anything telling here. No, there's still negative cash flow. I have no edge on the drugs. So, skip that. Anand uh million dollars in October. Thank you. We will love to have you Anand in in October when we open up to the smaller accounts. Uh what's the best book to learn about real estate? I have no idea. Start with Rich Dad Poor Dad and go from there. Um Uh, okay. So, he says, \"I know you don't invest take country risk, uh, DQ Energy, New Energy Corp. Uh, I would not invest in any other stocks other than Alibaba and maybe 10-centent in China because the numbers are good until they're not. So, you're just gambling that it's going to prove to not be a fraud and that's like a coin flip in China.\" So, hate to say it, negative free cash flow. Look, it's a trading vehicle. If you want to gamble, have at it. But I wouldn't buy it as a business. Would you put 100% of your net worth if JP Morgan was going to finance the debt? You would be the equity with 100% of your net worth. Would you put that in DQ Energy in China? The answer is no. Don't even buy a share. Like this is how people blow up and never get rich. Tim D, it's called greed and short-term thinking. Herz HTZ, by the way, I love the question. Thank you for asking it. I think you helped a lot of people by doing so. And welcome to the podcast. Glad to um grateful to have you. All right, next. Herz, no, not interested. Aman's buying. Who cares? Good for him. I'm sure he'll make money. I'm not going to participate. Casey Hughes, uh, thanks for both the breath and depth of your perspective in the podcast, all the media interviews. If you were still playing poker with Ray, I I never played poker with Ray Dia. I played poker with the his CIO, Greg Jansen, for 10 years. Uh, what do you think he would tell you? Why Bridgewwater exited their position in Baba earlier this month? I could care less. They've been exiting and entering at the exact wrong times for five years. So, uh, no opinion there. And they don't do fundamental analysis. They trade on algorithms based on who the hell knows what. It's not like they're not reading 10Ks and understanding the business. And the they they're global macro. They buy a basket of equities when they want risk on. They sell a basket of equities when they want risk off. They buy a basket when they want international exposure. sell a basket and people interpret it like they're stock pickers. They they have no clue as to what the underlying business is. They're they're they're expressing a macro view um with baskets. So, you're making wrong assumptions on the basis of uh of of what you're seeing in their filings. Greetings from Ireland. Keep up the good work. Uh, okay. So, he's saying Etsy sold shares. They sold like a few hund They It wasn't even First off, no. The business is generating free cash flow. Second off, people sell for a million reasons. They only buy for one. They're not selling like Palunteer is selling. They're selling hundreds of thousands. They're not selling tens of millions. Okay? So, you don't know if they have to buy a house. You don't know if they uh it could be a million things. Maybe they're going to get fired and they know it. So, the next guy will come on. That would be great. But um no, that has zero bearing on my fundamental analysis unless it's excessive and the valuations are high. Valuations are low. So if they want to sell in the hole, I'll I'll buy them from them. A jeep Alcandon, are you happy with the Canada Goose vest you bought last year? Thinking of getting one for the upcoming winter. Yeah, I've never had a better vest, but if they sell the company, I'm going to be pissed and burn it because I only made 50% instead of three or 4x. Uh, Flower Foods, F L. Uh, I mean, let's see.

Eric Flame. Uh, how do you search your investment ideas through sellside research? No, I never really read much sellside research uh other than the macro stuff. Um, industry network. No, no, I'm an independent thinker. I mean, that's the bottom line is like I I don't look for confirmation from other investors. Like, if they're already doing it, I probably missed it. So, I'm I have a framework. I like great quality companies that are generating cash that are temporarily impaired in price. So, I look for things that are down and then I try to come up with 10 reasons not to buy it. And if I can't come up with any good reasons, then I start to buy it. And that's that's the way it works. Always invert Charlie Mer. Um, Bees are homes and Excel. I don't like the producers of homes. I like the BZH. All right, you're probably fine with that one. Uh, Excel. I've looked at Bzer a million times over the years. That's why I can say that in five seconds. Uh, no interest in Excel. On to the next. Martin Gizwazooski. Gizwazooski. Easy peasy. CTS. Nentim [Music] EVD. I don't think it's really come down a lot. So, it doesn't really fit my filter. Seems like a decent business. What do they do? Leisure events. Oh, they're like a Live Nation type of thing. Eh, I'd rather buy Live Nation if I had to. Not for me. Charles Mer asks, \"Can you check Jolobi?\" All right, Charlie. Let's look at Jolobi. J O B I L E E. Guess that's a foreign company. J O B I L E. Oh, Jollibee. I don't know what that is. Send me a ticker next time. Yeah. Sorry. Next, uh Marlin's asking about Solar Edge. We covered this a million times. I think they'll there's going to be a time that they work. I don't want to be involved in this right now, which is probably the time to do it. I just hate those businesses because the polic you know, you have a policy headwind and you have negative free cash flow. So, let's just take a look. Yeah, it's starting to turn. Revenues are crashed. Maybe it's turning, maybe it's not. Do a ton of work, but I m I It's not I think it's going to work, but I don't want to be involved. Let's put it that way.

Well, there's no sign of a turn in there is  a sign of a turn in margins. I don't see any sign of a turn in revenues or in um free cash flow. So, you're going to have to do a ton of work with the calls and uh understanding what their promises for a better mñana are. But so far, it's not showing in their numbers. So, for me, it's a pass. But I do kind of this furniture housing theme is going to work and that, you know, that has to do with rates. Uh docu I don't know. docu I think eventually. Doesn't this get uh displaced by Ethereum people? I don't know. I mean, I've looked at this one a million times. I I don't know like other than the fact that everyone uses it and it has a little brand equity. I don't know what they do special that can't be replicated five ways from Sunday. I think they were just first movers and everything's kind of flattening out. I think your instinct is right there, Max. It's not for me, but I think you're probably generally in the right direction. I just wouldn't risk any money on it. Uh, check out Toast Software Company payments. It's a growth company with, you know, how much is priced in? I don't know. Let's see. 250 million IBIDA trading at $24 billion for a commodity payment service for restaurants. So 100 times trailing earnings 43 times forward and what were the sales enterprise value of sales? What's the expected growth rate on the earnings? So at least we can understand why people are willing to pay up for it [Music] 26%. It's trading up 40 times. So two peg I mean yeah if they keep executing perfectly you might make some money but it's not for me. I I can't guess the f I'm not a guess the future kind of guy. Cameron Franco thoughts on IBA again a biotech? No, we don't buy individual biotechs. We buy basket XBI we own. I have no edge here. Free cash flow is still negative. revenues are climbing, but no thank you. All right, let's try uh Oh, this is a great question, guys. Let me just see. I want to end with that question. Well, now let's see. What do you think about leverage? What if one runs a diversified port portfolio of like 15 names, but with like two times or three times or even five time leverage spread evenly? Would that make the risk of blowing up negligible? Um, this is a surefire way to be wearing a Walmart apron inside of 36 months because you're going to blow up your account and everything you've ever worked for. Low to no leverage. Do your work. If you're smart, you'll make outsized returns without material leverage. And if you're dumb, find another business. I mean, it's that simple. If you need leverage to make returns, you're guaranteed to blow up. So, I would uh hard pass on that, Jimmy Jones. But good question. I think you saved a lot of people. Could you look at Country Barrel, Old Country Store, Cracker Barrel? Uh, yeah, I have looked at it because they wanted me to talk about it. I would say the current CEO did a good job at Taco Bell International. their core problems. Uh, and I'm taking this from Marcus Lamonus who I was asking during the breaks. Uh, their inventory management in the stores are is bad and their food quality has gone down. But those are two things can turn. Uh, if it got back into the 40s, I'd probably be a buyer. It's kind of run away a little bit here. Uh, it's going to be a three to five year turnaround in my view, but it's it's kind of uh it's it's crossed my radar a few times in the last few months. I've done nothing with it. I'm not inclined to do anything with it, but it's on the radar. And that's that. So,\n\nCameron Franco thoughts on IBA again a biotech?

And Tom, one of those names on that earning calendar is the one you say to buy. Before we get to that, give me your sense right now of how the markets look. A little bit of a pullback after the big Friday rally. What does that tell you? >> Well, look, we we've been pound the table bullish for months now. Uh markets moved a long way, 30%. But we remain constructive. We've got Powell, 86%",
      "Nvidia is reporting on Wednesday. NYC listed Alibaba on Friday. What should investors be looking for? >> Um, as a major holder of Alibaba for a couple of years, brought our bases down to $82. I think Alibaba is going to knock shoot the lights out again. Uh, they're So, for for those who don't know, it's like the Amazon uh of uh of China. They've got 40% of the e-commerce market. It's a toll taker on the middle class. They got 40% of the cloud business. Think Amazon web services and growing. They're the cheapest AI play in the world. They have stakes in pretty much every AI startup in China. They've got the fastest large language models in in the Quen offerings. And that business, their AI products have grown triple digits every quarter for the last seven quarters. And I think we're going to see the same thing this quarter. So you got 20% expected earnings growth next year with Alibaba trading at about 13 times earnings. You can't get that anywhere in the United States. And then President Trump keeps saying, \"I'm going to meet with Xi and China and etc. We're going to shake hands.\" The minute they shake hands, this stock is going to be up so so big because Chinese stocks have outperformed US stocks.",
      "Top Chinese trade negotiators set to head to US as talks resume. Get this Alibaba back over, you know, 160, 180, uh, and then we can really get going. China Advisor calls for lifting consumption close to half of GDP. Their 2030 target is 70%. That's, you know, Alibaba is the toll taker. 40% of that bit, 40% of e-commerce, 40% of uh cloud, number one AI, you get the point. 30% international growth. China's stock euphoria spreads as turnover tops $430 billion. China euphoria. Could you imagine that a year ago? Bared upgrades. Masayoshan, who was one of the first investors in Alibaba, made his fortune through Alibaba, put up $2 billion into Intel because he believes they're going to be a leader in advanced chips. I'm sure he doesn't want to in incinerate $2 billion. Uh he's he's uh and by the way, he wasn't, you know, where was he before the government got involved? As soon as the government indicated they're going in, he went in right behind him because he knows what we know, which is it's a home run. Here we go. Boeing plans to sell 103 planes to Korean Air. Shocking. That came right after Trump visited.",

So people are like, did I miss it? You haven't missed it. It's just getting started with Alibaba. Okay, Alibaba is kind of the Amazon of China. Chinese stocks, the Hang Sang index has outperformed the S&P by 3 to one this year, 30% year-to- date versus 10%. Alibaba is kind of the the key component. They've got number one, it's a toll taker on the middle class, okay? So, they've got the largest retail business in Taoba and T-Mol. Uh they've got 40% of the cloud business. Think Amazon Web Service. They're growing like a weed. 18% per year. You know what's growing the fastest? The AI component. >> The chatbot that they've come out with. Exactly. It's unbelievable. Number one, it's faster on many metrics. Number two, that business is growing triple digits every quarter for the last seven consecutive quarters, and their international commerce business is growing at about 30%. >> So, what is your answer when we see that the Dow",
      "Hang Sang's up 30% year to date. Uh S&P's up about 10% year-to- date. You got c companies like Alibaba, their their um their large langu language models like Quen 1.0 2.0 are outperforming Chat GPT and some of the others on many different metrics. Uh you can buy 20% estimated earnings growth from an Alibaba for 13 times earnings. Okay, here in the US you've got Magnificent 7 decelerating earnings growth from 33% last year. next quarter is going to be right around 10%. By the way, that's not in the",

And most importantly, Liz, earnings estimates are going up for next year. went from $300 a share to $33 a share, which brings the multiple down a little bit. So, a lot of reasons to be excited.

      "Look at the KWEB ETF just getting ready to break out in a major way. This implies a measure move, you know, 17 to 30. So 47 first stop up in here, 4750, which would imply an Alibaba somewhere around 160. Uh so let's see what happens with earnings. We need the handshake with Trump and G, but uh maybe we'll get enough boost from earnings. We'll see. Certainly the cuts are going to start to help in September.

Whether you were making furniture, whether you were making what, you started making weapons for the war effort. Um I I think we're in a catch 22 in in the you know, not giving China our chips because they were very dependent on us up until about 2 3 years ago. They needed everything we could sell them they would take. And now because they've been forced to their technology advancement has I mean if you look at Alibaba's",

And now with Intel as a player and uh finishing out these fabs and being able to supply in coming years, it's going to be phenomenal for the acceleration of AI globally and productivity and everything else that goes along with it.

So, this is a good thing, not a bad thing, >> right? And you also mentioned Nvidia there, which reports this week. What are investors actually looking out for? Well, look, I mean, Nvidia is a situation where they, you know, have um at the moment uh almost a a monopoly on the chips required to drive AI. The problem is their business model relies on the kindness of strangers and they're only as good as Taiwan Semiconductors capacity to produce, which is limited. So, for a stock that is priced for perfection, uh the the number one thing we're going to need to see is strong guidance. Okay, the the numbers, you know, there have been rumors of them uh backing off on orders for for suppliers for the China China chips. The key is going to be strong guidance for the stock to hold up at these levels. >> Yeah, that would be a great place to live it. Thanks, Tom Hayes of Great Hill Capital. >> And we're back. So uh",
      "Nvidia is reporting on Wednesday. NYC listed Alibaba on Friday. What should investors be looking for? >> Um, as a major holder of Alibaba for a couple of years, brought our bases down to $82. I think Alibaba is going to knock shoot the lights out again. Uh, they're So, for for those who don't know, it's like the Amazon uh of uh of China. They've got 40% of the e-commerce market. It's a toll taker on the middle class. They got 40% of the cloud business. Think Amazon web services and growing. They're the cheapest AI play in the world. They have stakes in pretty much every AI startup in China. They've got the fastest large language models in in the Quen offerings. And that business, their AI products have grown triple digits every quarter for the last seven quarters. And I think we're going to see the same thing this quarter. So you got 20% expected earnings growth next year with Alibaba trading at about 13 times earnings. You can't get that anywhere in the United States. And then President Trump keeps saying, \"I'm going to meet with Xi and China and etc. We're going to shake hands.\" The minute they shake hands, this stock is going to be up so so big because Chinese stocks have outperformed US stocks. Most people don't know this this year. Hang's up 30%, S&P is up 10%. So that's that's where I'd be focused on. Uh personally as it relates to Nvidia earnings are probably going to be good. Okay, we know that the demand is there. The question is the supply and their guidance looking forward. It is uh priced for really good things to happen. So if any aspect of the guidance is less than expected or slightly weak, you could have a little bit of short-term turbulence, but it's a juggernaut. And the big play that's going to help Nvidia that no one's paying attention to is Intel because Nvidia's sales growth rate has slowed down dramatically. Not due to lack of demand, lack of supply. Taiwan semiconductor can only give them so much allocation. If we stand up Intel to produce these advanced chips, which now the government has backstopped, uh that's going to be really really good for Nvidia as well as Intel.",

      "the bottom line is you know believe it or not the best thing that could ever happen to Nvidia is that the Intel deal succeeds.

They need excess capacity of production of advanced chips. And this $10 billion deal the 18A node in Arizona is going to be critical because all the designers what people don't realize that their business models rely on the kindness of strangers. Okay?

I love Pollson stuff, but um the name of the game now is every $300 billion is 1% of GD uh is is a 1% improvement in the deficit. So we're at about 500600 billion of um tariff revenue proforma. So that's 2% that takes us to 3 negative 3.7% deficit which is in line with the last 50-year average. And then you add on top of that um savings in interest. If we lower rates by 100 basis points over the next year, that's another 300 billion. That takes you to like a trillion dollars of savings, which means you're at 3% deficit, which is the best deficit we've had in a long, long time, fiscal responsibility. So, it's coming along.

Beacon accounts for the first 10 billion and Jacobs accomplish that in the first year. Some have patience. Park this one in the filing cabinet and let Brad Jacobs have some patience. Park this one in the filing cabinet and let Brad Jacobs work his magic. So that's that Generrack update. Look at this free cash flow off the charts, ladies and gentlemen. Last time you had free cash flow this high, you had a four$45 $500 stock, $450 stock. It's still at 200 uh even though it's doubled in the last few months. Yeeha. Another one of our favorite picks and shovel plays on the housing recovery is Gener, or as we like to call it, the Kleenex of generators. This sleepy name turned out to be a textbook example of a quote we live by at Great Hill Capital. great great investment opportunities come around when excellent companies are surrounded by unusual circumstances that cause the stock price to be misappraised. Gener found itself caught way off sides following a once in a century pandemic event. The ensuing deto cycle drove inventories up 85% from 2021 to 2022 leading to multiple quarters of negative free cash flow and a gross margin collapse of over 500 basis points sending the stock down more than 80%. That's when Gener came across our desk and quickly got our attention through the noise and temporary overhang. We saw a high-quality market leader with nearly 80% market share, strong normalized earnings, a solid balance sheet, a shareholder friendly management team with skin in the game, and secular tailwinds that weren't going anywhere. That gave us all the confidence we needed to build a solidsized position. Management quickly got to work on the turnaround, spending the next few quarters cleaning up inventories, which were back to normalized levels by the end of 2024. As expected, gross margins sharply rebounded from a trough of just 33% to over 39% while free cash flow inflected and hit a record high of 605 million with another strong year of 400 plus million on deck for 2025. Needless to say, the turnaround has played out exactly as we expected, rewarding us with a solid double in just a few years. The good news is that when you buy a great business at great prices, you tend to get upside surprises along the way. This past quarter, Generrack delivered exactly that, anni announcing its entry into the megawatt generator market for AI and data centers along with guidance for the space, but that frankly blew us away. Here are a few lines from the earnings call that put it into perspective. Quote, I think this is by far and away one of the biggest needlemoving opportunities that I've seen in my time here in my three decades with the company. quote again, like I said, I don't I've never seen something that can move the needle like this. I think if we do things the right way, this part of our business, the data center uh generators, FYI, uh which has always been a good solid business, is over a call it $ 1.5 billion opportunity. That's the size of the entire CNI products part of our business. That's something that can grow dramatically in the next several years. We could be in a situation in several years where CNI products are larger than the entire rest of the company. Because of this, some quick back of the envelope math shows the scale of the opportunity for CNI to surpass the rest of the company revenues would need to reach at least $3 billion for the segment. If you assign zero growth to the rest of the business during that time, which is low probability with housing just turning up, meaning the breadandbut residential business suddenly flat lines along with your uh energy storage, etc., total revenues would still reach $6 billion or roughly 40% above 2024 levels. The way I see it, this past quarter was a complete gamecher for Generrack. What began as a sleepy contrarian Dtock restock turnaround has morphed into an AI and data center play for us. That is the whipped cream on and cherry on top. Here's everything you need to know about Gener Lights Out quarter. You're going to have to read this on your own. We underlined all the important parts for you. Um there's a lot there and the 10 key points I would definitely go through with the revenue growth earnings uh megawatt generators CNI home standby ecob is now turning cash flow positive or profitable by the end of the year cash flow from operations buybacks everything you want to know all right there laid out for you we did the work for you moving on let's go to fear and greed again greedy Not crazy but greedy. So pay attention. Earnings, exploration and production top 30 weights last 60 days starting to move up for next year 62 basis points. Industrials similar story up 16 basis points for next year. Uh on to continuing claims uh still high a little bit better than expected. Core PCE came in line with expectations. GDP Q2 3.3 little better than expectations. Initial jobless claims again continues to be elevated 229. Let's take a look at what that looks like visually and then uh let's get down to our",

So perfect better a perfect plan today than an imperfect plan tomorrow because tomorrow may never come. You can see the bearishness is ticking up uh among retail investors. So you know it's just something to pay attention to. I'm kind of glad that they're not exuberant the way that they were going into August where we got a little bit of bumpiness.

The best jockey in the business, Brad Jacobs. Brad Jacobs track record speaks for itself. An investment in XPO when he got involved would have been a 50 bagger.

    "GENER": [
      "the last few months. Yeeha. Another one of our favorite picks and shovel plays on the housing recovery is Gener, or as we like to call it, the Kleenex of generators. This sleepy name turned out to be a textbook example of a quote we live by at Great Hill Capital. great great investment opportunities come around when excellent companies are surrounded by unusual circumstances that cause the stock price to be misappraised. Gener found itself caught way off sides following a once in a century pandemic event. The ensuing deto cycle drove inventories up 85% from 2021 to 2022 leading to multiple quarters of negative free cash flow and a gross margin collapse of over 500 basis points sending the stock down more than 80%. That's when Gener came across our desk and quickly got our attention through the noise and temporary overhang. We saw a high-quality market leader with nearly 80% market share, strong normalized earnings, a solid balance sheet, a shareholder friendly management team with skin in the game, and secular tailwinds that weren't going anywhere. That gave us all the confidence we needed to build a solidsized position. Management quickly got to work on the turnaround, spending the next few quarters cleaning up inventories, which were back to normalized levels by the end of 2024. As expected, gross margins sharply rebounded from a trough of just 33% to over 39% while free cash flow inflected and hit a record high of 605 million with another strong year of 400 plus million on deck for 2025. Needless to say, the turnaround has played out exactly as we expected, rewarding us with a solid double in just a few years. The good news is that when you buy a great business at great prices, you tend to get upside surprises along the way. This past quarter, Generrack delivered exactly that, anni announcing its entry into the megawatt generator market for AI and data centers along with guidance for the space, but that frankly blew us away. Here are a few lines from the earnings call that put it into perspective. Quote, I think this is by far and away one of the biggest needlemoving opportunities that I've seen in my time here in my three decades with the company. quote again, like I said, I don't I've never seen something that can move the needle like this. I think if we do things the right way, this part of our business, the data center uh generators, FYI, uh which has always been a good solid business, is over a call it $ 1.5 billion opportunity. That's the size of the entire CNI products part of our business. That's something that can grow dramatically in the next several years. We could be in a situation in several years where CNI products are larger than the entire rest of the company. Because of this, some quick back of the envelope math shows the scale of the opportunity for CNI to surpass the rest of the company revenues would need to reach at least $3 billion for the segment. If you assign zero growth to the rest of the business during that time, which is low probability with housing just turning up, meaning the breadandbut residential business suddenly flat lines along with your uh energy storage, etc., total revenues would still reach $6 billion or roughly 40% above 2024 levels. The way I see it, this past quarter was a complete gamecher for Generrack. What began as a sleepy contrarian Dtock restock turnaround has morphed into an AI and data center play for us. That is the whipped cream on and cherry on top. Here's everything you need to know about Gener Lights Out quarter. You're going to have to read this on your own. We underlined all the important parts for you. Um there's a lot there and the 10 key points I would definitely go through with the revenue growth earnings uh megawatt generators CNI home standby ecob is now turning cash flow positive or profitable by the end of the year cash flow from operations buybacks everything you want to know all right there laid out for you we did the work for you moving on let's go to fear and greed again greedy Not crazy but greedy. So pay attention. Earnings, exploration and production top 30 weights last 60 days starting to move up for next year 62 basis points. Industrials similar story up 16 basis points for next year. Uh on to continuing claims uh still high a little bit better than expected. Core PCE came in line with expectations. GDP Q2 3.3 little better than expectations. Initial jobless claims again continues to be elevated 229. Let's take a look at what that looks like visually and then uh let's get down to our"
