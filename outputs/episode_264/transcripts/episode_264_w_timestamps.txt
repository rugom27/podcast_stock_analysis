[6.6s] videoast podcast for the week ending
[9.48s] November 7th 2024 we got a lot of great
[12.96s] stuff to cover today family first uh
[15.839s] this is Mimi and Annabelle Annabelle
[18.84s] started 68 water polo Academy part-time
[21.279s] and loves it she&#39;s by far the youngest
[23.08s] athlete ever admitted but because of her
[25.24s] speed they gave her a spot Mimi flew to
[27.359s] Chicago today with her coach and the 908
[29.679s] water Polo Club to compete in the
[31.439s] Champions Cup this pre prestigious
[34.32s] tournament brings together top middle
[36.0s] school players from clubs across the

[39.96s] respective zones the winners of each
[42.12s] Zone face off in the Champions Cup to
[44.44s] determine the ultimate Champion 908 is
[46.8s] entering the tournament as the number
[48.399s] one seed so very very proud of them and
[52.92s] let&#39;s see what else we got this week uh
[54.76s] that&#39;s Mimi at Portillos I know that&#39;s
[56.6s] been an ask me anything question for uh
[59.559s] some time and that&#39;s one of Mimi&#39;s
[62.519s] favorite they have the Chicago style
[63.96s] dogs which is appropriate because she&#39;s
[65.92s] in Chicago this week and that is the
[68.439s] studio where uh vanney and Co is shot so
[71.88s] you can see behind the scenes that&#39;s the
[73.56s] desk we sit on that&#39;s Stu vanney in the
[75.36s] background uh very excited so let&#39;s get
[77.68s] down to Media first and foremost I want
[81.24s] to thank Stu Barney I want to thank
[85.84s] Preston myelle and I want to thank
[88.36s] Christian dagger for having me on varne
[90.6s] and Company Fox Business this week right
[93.0s] after the election uh at the top of the
[95.56s] hour 9:00 a.m. started the show we
[97.56s] talked about H the implications of the
[101.64s] election results so we&#39;re going to tune
[103.88s] in here left hand side of your screen
[106.32s] that&#39;s Dow that&#39;s a stock futures I mean
[108.88s] they&#39;re way up 1,200 points up for the
[111.759s] Dow over 116 for the S&amp;P that&#39;s a rally
[115.439s] and a half it&#39;s a trump rally let&#39;s be
[117.36s] obvious about it Tom Hayes joins with
[119.159s] this morning checking out the market for
[121.079s] us it&#39;s a trump rally obviously how long
[123.799s] does it last well that&#39;s a great
[125.6s] question this is what lower regulation
[127.24s] and lower taxes look like Stuart uh I
[129.759s] wouldn&#39;t chase this up immediately but I
[131.76s] think this is a a a sign of great things
[134.84s] to come over the next four years no
[136.599s] question about it uh the opportunities
[139.44s] here obviously you&#39;re seeing small caps
[141.08s] outperform this morning up 6% we like
[144.0s] Regional Banks that&#39;s going to continue
[145.76s] to flourish uh and Intel is
[148.28s] interestingly enough I know I&#39;ve brought
[149.56s] this up on the show remember when it
[151.04s] collapsed below 20 and I said steu I
[152.959s] think it&#39;s a buy here it&#39;s trading below
[154.36s] breakup value it&#39;s up 42% why because
[157.56s] Trump is going to want to manufacture
[158.959s] those chips in the United States and
[160.72s] reduce our dependency on Taiwan for our
[163.12s] chips that&#39;s a national security thing
[165.36s] and another one that again no one likes
[167.8s] is Boeing Boeing was up 300% during
[171.599s] Trump&#39;s first term this is a hated stock
[174.68s] right now they&#39;ve just resolved the
[175.92s] rally I think there&#39;s going to be
[177.239s] opportunity there as well you&#39;re
[179.159s] assuming that Trump has something to do
[180.84s] with a turnaround for Boeing I&#39;m not
[182.56s] sure Bo is a proxy for us manufacturing
[186.36s] and Trump is All About Us manufacturing
[188.72s] this is going to be a manufacturing
[190.2s] friendly environment there are going to
[191.519s] be policies that are going to be
[192.72s] manufacturing friendly and when you
[194.44s] unleash American inity and Manufacturing
[196.959s] good things happen why is not a good
[199.879s] idea to buy bonds at the moment why why
[202.44s] buy bonds when you&#39;ve got stocks ring
[204.08s] like this well no question about it
[205.959s] however uh what we&#39;re seeing in the bond
[208.4s] market is the positioning is so short uh
[211.959s] from hedge funds and from large Traders
[214.36s] they are the most short that they&#39;ve
[215.599s] been bonds since October of last year
[218.72s] and following that there was a ripy face
[221.0s] off rally in Bonds in November and
[223.159s] December of last year so I think after
[224.92s] this initial shock effect as after the
[226.76s] market settles out in the next few days
[228.239s] we also have the FED on Thursday that&#39;s
[230.4s] a that&#39;s a big decision fed will
[232.36s] continue to cut probably have to cut
[234.56s] less than the market is pricing in right
[236.239s] now but they will continue to cut I
[238.04s] think there is an opportunity to
[239.879s] selectively buy Bonds in the coming days
[242.36s] not immediately today this is the shock
[244.079s] effect but with as much as they&#39;ve come
[246.159s] in in the last month there&#39;s opportunity
[247.799s] there as well look at that yield on the
[249.12s] tenure
[250.28s] 446 how about that it was 36 few weeks
[253.959s] ago that&#39;s something else Tom thanks for
[255.48s] much indeed thank you Ste President
[257.0s] elect Trump
[258.84s] calling and we&#39;re back and then I want
[262.12s] to thank chabuk ogu who quoted me in his
[265.8s] article today for Reuters regarding the
[268.4s] FED cut today definitely want to read
[270.6s] that one over at hedge fund tips.com and
[273.479s] then want to thank Luca blowman for
[277.12s] including me in her article on
[282.24s] Alibaba and uh and the turnaround just
[285.28s] beginning just uh that uh quotes of the
[288.52s] week before we get down to it uh first
[290.68s] from Warren Buffett the stock market is
[292.4s] a device from transferring money from
[295.36s] the impatient to the patient so many
[298.56s] people are shaking out of great stocks
[301.4s] due to bad headlines because they don&#39;t
[303.919s] know what they own they haven&#39;t done the
[305.6s] financial analysis they haven&#39;t done the
[307.36s] research analysis and on this podcast
[310.52s] every week we do our best to share some
[312.759s] ideas with uh parts of our framework how
[315.4s] you can do that and uh for many of you
[317.84s] it&#39;s helped quite a bit and we&#39;ve been
[319.28s] getting such amazing letters and
[320.96s] feedback very very grateful for that uh
[324.56s] my idea of a great business is one that
[327.319s] has a shortage of competitors that&#39;s
[329.319s] from Peter Lynch and that&#39;s why we keep
[331.84s] pounding the table on Boeing the strike
[334.639s] is over they did do some dilution but it
[337.199s] only takes the share count back to 2014
[339.88s] levels they&#39; bought in a ton of stock
[342.039s] and as soon as the cash flow SP it turns
[343.919s] on they&#39;re going to buy in all that
[345.24s] stock once again uh so hang in there
[347.919s] they&#39;ve got a 10-year backlog a half a
[349.919s] trillion dollars there&#39;s not a whole lot
[351.479s] to think about there Warren Buffett it&#39;s
[354.039s] better to hang out with people better
[355.68s] than you pick out Associates whose
[357.639s] behavior is better than yours and you&#39;ll
[359.199s] drift in that direction that&#39;s from
[361.0s] Warren Buffett and and that&#39;s been my
[362.88s] rule you know as I&#39;ve said many times on
[365.36s] this uh video cast I&#39;ve never optimized
[368.44s] for maximum AUM and and certainly it&#39;s
[370.639s] been rolling in and we&#39;re very very
[372.479s] grateful for that but you know the
[374.56s] reason I do that intro call with
[377.12s] everyone that inquires about investing
[379.72s] each quarter is because I want to work
[382.8s] for people that I am super excited about
[385.88s] when I wake up every morning to make
[387.44s] money for them I like them I respect
[389.599s] respect them I admire them and each and
[391.8s] every one of them is better than me in
[393.8s] their own respective areas of expertise
[396.08s] so I learn from them and they&#39;re just
[398.039s] winners across the board uh and that
[400.84s] that&#39;s how I&#39;ve created my Mastermind is
[403.08s] attracting amazing clients and friends
[406.52s] around me who have many have become
[408.72s] friends um
[410.8s] through uh all of the things that go
[413.68s] into the podcast and referrals and um uh
[417.919s] uh getting to know people so it&#39;s just
[419.72s] been an unbelievable blessing and um and
[422.879s] it&#39;s right from the master himself

[454.4s] 2042 so we&#39;ll be going to that as well
[457.0s] we we take a long-term view with
[458.599s] everything uh so uh so we&#39;re excited and

[524.24s] that for you moving along onto our
[527.12s] charts of the week of course our
[529.36s] favorite reporter uh at our favorite
[532.04s] publication I put a quote in favorite
[535.399s] reporter and underline under favorite
[537.68s] publication favorite publication is
[539.6s] Baron favorite reporter with constant
[541.88s] negative headlines uh about China has
[544.399s] their newest People&#39;s National Congress
[546.76s] is expected to okay fiscal stimulus but
[549.48s] will it be enough uh okay so let&#39;s get
[552.44s] down to some of these charts and for
[554.0s] those of you whove been around you
[555.079s] remember three weeks ago we went through
[557.56s] uh it was something like a 100
[559.24s] consecutive negative headlines about
[561.32s] China from this particular reporter for
[564.48s] uh three years basically is is what it
[566.72s] comes down to and the interesting thing
[569.16s] is they put a new reporter on the beat
[571.12s] and we&#39;re going to go through her
[572.12s] headlines because she actually had
[573.72s] something very positive to say about
[576.0s] Alibaba uh at a 100 bucks after it&#39;s you
[578.92s] know uh U come up from from its lows at
[583.56s] 58 um and uh we&#39;re grateful to see that
[587.88s] uh change in uh shift in in Outlook and
[592.279s] we&#39;ll start to see more and more people
[594.04s] get on board as it goes from 100 back to
[596.36s] 120 to 140 to 160 to 180 at 200 people
[601.32s] will really hate it because they&#39;ve
[602.959s] missed it and they&#39;ll hate it all and
[604.8s] then by 300 everyone will love it and
[606.8s] we&#39;ll be laying it off so uh same plan
[609.48s] since day one some happen faster than
[611.32s] you expect some happen slower than you
[612.88s] expect but let&#39;s get down to some new
[614.36s] charts here uh here&#39;s a chart from
[616.519s] someone called D chart life and it&#39;s uh
[621.279s] the biotech xbi which we&#39;ve had for some
[624.32s] time and um it shows here we bought in
[628.079s] the hole uh 2022 and then it rallied
[631.399s] straight up we thought we were Geniuses
[633.16s] until it retested those lows again in
[635.56s] 2023 and then it ripo rally did a minor
[638.8s] base and now it looks like it&#39;s going to
[640.839s] break out for good here so it&#39;s up off
[642.76s] the lows from the 60s to now
[645.2s] 103 and uh he&#39;s got a Target line of 130
[648.72s] because of this resistance or whatever
[650.16s] the hell it is uh I think this is going
[652.12s] to work its way higher than that over
[654.76s] time so that that story is just
[656.32s] beginning and we&#39;ve been patient with
[657.76s] that uh while everyone else sold Down in
[660.36s] the Hole here and then sold Down in the
[662.88s] Hole again here and then bought up here
[665.12s] sold Down in the Hole here uh what is
[667.76s] the stock market it is a device for
[669.76s] transferring money from the impatient to
[672.2s] the patient and that&#39;s exactly what&#39;s
[674.12s] happening with biotech uh Matt Sur
[677.16s] minaro works for um Tom Lee he put this
[681.44s] out uh NASDAQ Composite just had 14% of
[684.48s] its members make 52 we highs we tend to
[688.12s] see this sort of breath TR in maturing
[690.839s] bull markets like the one we have now
[692.56s] good sign for Bulls so you can see these
[694.6s] instances 1 2 3 4 5 six and this is the
[698.76s] seventh uh where you just see continued
[701.8s] follow through which is positive China
[704.12s] Equity Funds see the outflow for the
[706.0s] third straight week just in time for the
[708.72s] China stimulus tomorrow to offset the
[711.639s] Trump fear uh I think they&#39;ll do
[714.24s] something reasonably sizable tomorrow
[717.0s] but based on the numbers we&#39;ve been
[718.519s] seeing in their economy their export
[720.36s] numbers uh the numbers that came in this
[723.0s] week uh it was
[725.88s] absolutely uh uh it&#39;s moving on its own
[729.72s] and the additional Insurance stimulus
[731.92s] that they&#39;re going to put out tomorrow
[733.079s] will just add add turbo boost to what&#39;s
[735.72s] already
[737.36s] happening great financial crisis pushed
[740.04s] stock allocations below the traditional
[742.76s] 60 to 65% ban they still haven&#39;t
[745.959s] recovered so when you think about
[748.079s] getting to euphor
[749.76s] points uh you could start saying that in
[753.199s] the 60 above 65 which we saw in the uh
[758.04s] Tech peak in 2000 and then in the
[760.8s] banking peak in 65 we are nowhere in
[763.959s] that neighborhood ladies and gentlemen
[765.48s] which tells me uh and with all the
[768.04s] positive developments from a policy
[772.199s] standpoint that there&#39;s a lot more juice
[774.68s] to this over the coming years there will
[777.16s] be pull there will be 10% pullbacks are
[779.44s] every year there will be 20% Corrections
[782.6s] that happens maybe even 30% but I think
[786.56s] from now through early 2030s and we&#39;ve
[789.959s] talked about the demographics over and
[791.56s] over uh the path of least resistance is
[794.199s] up because the bulk of our population is
[796.56s] in their still in their early 30s and
[799.199s] that spending should not slow as as a
[801.16s] matter of fact it accelerates all the
[802.76s] way to their early 30s so another solid
[806.24s] 6 eight plus years that we can make
[809.639s] unbelievable amounts of money in a short
[812.079s] period of time together and I&#39;m very
[813.839s] very excited about that uh here is the
[817.12s] equity sentiment it improved in October
[819.72s] but it&#39;s not at extreme levels just yet
[823.279s] uh UK government biggest fiscal
[825.76s] loosening since 2009 so they are turning
[829.199s] the stimulus Jets on that will help gxo
[832.24s] where 50% of their revenues are top 10
[835.6s] stocks are 37% of the S&amp;P so we started
[839.36s] to see before the election some hiccups
[841.24s] among those stocks um I think I think
[844.839s] that more likely than not we will
[849.04s] see a lot of continued breath which
[852.56s] began this summer and has
[855.68s] continued um that&#39;s going to enable the
[859.48s] mag 7
[861.72s] to kind of perform more modestly
[864.68s] relative to what they&#39;ve done off the
[866.079s] 2022 lows and allow those that are just
[869.839s] getting started to really really
[871.92s] accelerate and and a lot of these
[873.519s] turnarounds to become full recoveries
[876.279s] and uh and return to profitable growth
[879.0s] again which we hear a lot in the
[880.399s] conference calls largest US deficit
[883.199s] since the Great Depression World War II
[885.519s] how did they get out of that they
[886.92s] inflated their way out of it so expect 3
[888.88s] to
[889.56s] 4% uh or you know 275 to 3.5% for the
[894.04s] next four or five years that&#39;ll be great
[896.24s] it will bring down debt to GDP probably
[898.6s] down to about 80 75% we saw a similar
[902.079s] situation from uh 1948 to
[905.079s] 1956 actually it dropped to 57 from 120%
[909.399s] so uh we&#39;re on the same Playbook boj
[912.519s] signals more rate hikes as it sees uh
[915.639s] receded overseas risks that will be
[918.72s] negative for Japanese equities that will
[921.12s] be positive for Chinese equities all of
[924.0s] that Asia money crowded into Japan in uh
[927.36s] when China was locked down now will be
[929.36s] forced back in as prices go up and more
[932.56s] and more sentiment shifts in the
[934.399s] Articles and uh commentary and narrative
[937.88s] Etc and you&#39;re seeing the China
[939.88s] manufacturing PMI turned positive again
[943.279s] uh manufacturing orders ripped higher in
[945.959s] China uh bull bear indicator again it&#39;s
[949.44s] bullish but it&#39;s not at an extreme yet
[951.839s] which means there&#39;s probably some gas
[953.72s] left in the tank and seasonally this is
[956.079s] the time of year that it happens
[959.44s] uh election our three contrarian
[961.839s] pushbacks this is from haret one of the
[963.519s] best in the
[965.639s] business uh he says if we get a red
[968.92s] sweep uh it&#39;s best played via small cap
[971.759s] that was similar to what I was talking
[972.8s] to Stu about um and best played via
[977.16s] China Tech well we are overweight both
[979.839s] of those and it looks like we are going
[982.04s] to actually wind up with the red sweep
[985.72s] so surging excess liquidity will soon
[989.759s] buoy oil prices we tend to agree we do
[993.199s] think there&#39;s probably some opportunity
[994.759s] in the servicers that benefit from
[996.72s] volumes versus the producers that
[999.24s] benefit from Price uh I I wouldn&#39;t I
[1003.68s] wouldn&#39;t bet against a big price
[1005.399s] increase in oil uh but I also wouldn&#39;t
[1008.399s] bet for it so I would play it the safe
[1010.56s] way uh which is that a lot more of it&#39;s
[1013.04s] going to be pumped and uh you want to
[1015.0s] play the pick and shovels versus the uh
[1017.92s] versus the ones taking it out of the
[1019.6s] ground one of the most important charts
[1021.839s] in energy policy now in our view this is
[1024.4s] from Bank of America and they talk about
[1027.039s] energy source and return on invested
[1029.6s] Capital by source and as you can see the
[1032.36s] worst return on invested Capital are
[1034.559s] wind biomass and solar expect to see
[1037.4s] less of that in the next four years and
[1039.64s] the highest return on invested Capital
[1041.679s] are nuclear Hydro coal and natural gas
[1045.079s] expect to see more of that in coming
[1047.679s] years nuclear is the cheapest clean
[1049.84s] energy when all costs considered and US
[1053.6s] economic growth extends solid streak GDP
[1056.6s] cow Rose at 2.8% annual return in the
[1059.64s] third quarter also speaks to what we
[1061.76s] said there would be a lull in uh
[1064.28s] earnings this quarter although they&#39;re
[1066.039s] up over 5% relative to 4.2% expectations
[1070.28s] and then a massive reacceleration to
[1072.24s] double digits in Q4 which seems to be
[1075.72s] playing out Chinese manufacturing again
[1078.36s] a different the official indicator back
[1080.6s] up back into expansion above 50 China
[1083.44s] Factory activity expands for the first
[1085.2s] time since April official survey shows
[1087.679s] that&#39;s different from the Kon survey
[1090.08s] which I&#39;m probably slaughtering the name
[1092.48s] pronunciation but you know what I&#39;m an
[1094.559s] American I am what I am India over
[1097.32s] Chinese equities has collapsed in the
[1099.72s] last few months we talked about that the
[1101.6s] hot money is going to come out of India
[1103.96s] and back into China as price goes up and
[1107.039s] opinion follows trend
[1111.799s] a solid 2% beat with surprisingly strong
[1118.159s] guidance oh 2% above estimates so it was
[1121.6s] 4.2 they&#39;re saying it&#39;s 6.2 fact said
[1124.799s] saying it&#39;s 5.2 okay it&#39;s better than
[1128.6s] expected it&#39;s not blowout better than
[1130.36s] expected we had been beating by 3% now
[1132.88s] we&#39;re beating by 2% but you can see
[1135.96s] sector by sector mentions of bottom
[1138.28s] surge in the earnings calls this quarter
[1140.799s] which historically indicated an EPS
[1142.799s] bottoming cycle which we have been
[1144.72s] talking about publicly for the last few
[1146.52s] weeks that Q3 would be a bottoming and
[1149.0s] then a re acceleration corporate
[1151.4s] sentiment indicator fell so far this
[1153.159s] earning season but it&#39;s at record highs
[1155.0s] so it&#39;s nothing to be alarmed about it&#39;s
[1156.84s] just cooling a little bit like it does
[1159.12s] in every bull market Trend coming off of
[1161.44s] recovery boom to new highs a little
[1163.88s] check back like we had here and then a
[1166.12s] pullback and then you keep going the
[1168.4s] indic indicator suggests 12%
[1170.799s] year-on-year EPS in Q4 versus 9%
[1174.159s] consensus and then you can see here the
[1176.36s] lull of the
[1180.159s] unmagnify uh the deceleration of The
[1182.559s] Magnificent 7 in terms of earnings
[1184.52s] growth and then the massive
[1185.76s] reacceleration over the next few
[1187.28s] quarters for uh
[1191.039s] unmagnify and the stabilization of the
[1194.44s] freefall of The Magnificent Seven
[1196.88s] earnings growth due to all the Tech
[1199.76s] spend pause before re acceleration eight
[1202.64s] out of 11 sectors are expected to see
[1206.12s] decelerating earnings growth in Q3 and
[1209.52s] then you see the reacceleration in Q4 so
[1212.72s] the worst are expected to be Industrials
[1215.52s] energy and materials and then next next
[1218.88s] quarter they all rebound materials for
[1221.08s] instance from negative 8 9% to plus 11
[1224.28s] we&#39;re playing that through albamar as
[1226.44s] we&#39;ve talked about then you&#39;ve got uh
[1229.72s] Industrials uh -6 to -1 and then you got
[1235.12s] group you have groups like uh financials
[1238.039s] jumping we&#39;re playing that through the
[1239.559s] KR the uh Regional basket which we
[1242.039s] bought in that meltdown in
[1244.039s] 2023 and then
[1249.08s] um what else here another utilities are
[1252.4s] expect to re re accelerate so they&#39;ll
[1254.28s] have to sell off more for for me to get
[1256.44s] interested demand recovery equals higher
[1260.0s] margins uh so we are seeing that easing
[1263.44s] rate pressure should translate into a
[1265.24s] pickup in
[1266.28s] manufacturing uh we got another cut
[1268.28s] today as expected this is speaks very
[1271.039s] highly of the FED who have now proven
[1273.72s] themselves to be an apolitical
[1276.559s] organization meaning they followed
[1278.72s] through with expectations and the plan
[1281.72s] irrespective of their guesses about
[1284.559s] future policy Andor the results of the
[1287.4s] election so kudos to them uh as I&#39;ve
[1290.64s] said since day one which was a minority
[1293.4s] opinion which is now becoming a closer
[1295.679s] to a consensus opinion is that our
[1298.039s] terminal rate would be much higher than
[1300.36s] the market had anticipated uh Market was
[1303.0s] saying the terminal rate would be around
[1304.559s] three I think they will be done around
[1306.6s] four because growth will be strong
[1308.52s] enough and that&#39;s what happens in a
[1310.44s] midcycle cut like 1995 you don&#39;t need a
[1313.44s] ton 125 150 bips is enough to get the
[1316.64s] machine going and preserve the job
[1321.799s] falling mortgage rates also suggest a
[1323.799s] pickup in housing so they peaked
[1325.64s] yesterday they&#39;re coming back down uh
[1327.96s] just like when I said with um
[1330.679s] Stu wait for it to settle out a day or
[1333.159s] so and then buy bonds I think you I
[1335.44s] think it&#39;s a good time to buy bonds and
[1337.0s] as a matter of fact we had uh slugs of
[1340.52s] new money from existing clients come in
[1343.84s] and uh we were able to get a little
[1346.0s] exposure there as well um
[1349.32s] falling mortgage rate suggest a pick up
[1352.279s] in housing that will help J which is
[1354.36s] doing fantastic that will help Stanley
[1356.48s] Black and&amp; Decker which is on track with
[1359.0s] their plan just not fast enough for Wall
[1360.88s] Street so the impatient sell to us and
[1363.279s] the patient stick with it and cash out
[1366.159s] at a double Plus in a year in two years
[1368.679s] and three years it doesn&#39;t really matter
[1371.0s] um uh worst of the inventory destocking
[1373.919s] cycle is likely behind us so you say
[1375.919s] well we miss you you say well then I
[1378.0s] missed it because Tom was talking about
[1380.12s] that that it was going to bottom a year
[1381.44s] ago and we&#39;ve had this huge rally yes we
[1383.84s] have but look historically there&#39;s a lot
[1386.48s] of time after you get from these
[1388.919s] depression type of uh um destocking
[1393.52s] Cycles to restocking that you get years
[1396.88s] of upward bull market after that bottom
[1399.159s] so we haven&#39;t even got over the midline
[1401.24s] yet and uh and then even after that you
[1403.84s] get more and more and more so this is
[1405.52s] the beginning we are just getting
[1407.12s] started this I got a aged extremely well
[1410.159s] I put this out on Monday morning uh
[1413.2s] which was the day before the
[1415.32s] election
[1417.0s] and uh I said I wonder if all these put
[1420.4s] buyers ahead of the election are going
[1421.84s] to get paid with a funny face I don&#39;t
[1424.84s] know whatever Emoji uh history does not
[1427.88s] suggest it the 2024 put call ratio
[1431.6s] followed by second post of 2016 put call
[1434.96s] ratio and third post of 2020 put call
[1437.799s] ration ratio not to worry whoever is
[1439.84s] elected will take credit so you can see
[1442.08s] here that the put call ratio got up it
[1445.0s] actually got up spiked that day at
[1447.44s] 130 uh which is Extreme there was so
[1450.159s] much fear and then uh same thing in 2016
[1455.08s] before Trump got elected it spiked up to
[1457.96s] 140 uh and then same thing in 2016 even
[1461.4s] with Biden it spiked up to 120 right
[1464.679s] before the election and then what did
[1466.44s] you see a collapse in in uh vix and a
[1470.919s] rally in S&amp;P collapse in vix rally in
[1473.399s] S&amp;P collapse in vix rally in S&amp;P why do
[1476.039s] you get that all at once is
[1478.919s] because uh you catch the whole Market
[1481.72s] off sides and there&#39;s no way the the
[1485.6s] sellers of that premium are letting
[1487.64s] these people get get paid when everyone
[1490.279s] crowded in to pay the most expensive
[1492.36s] price at the exact wrong time for
[1494.88s] insurance they got they&#39;re they got
[1497.48s] smoked okay so happens every time and so
[1501.0s] this wasn&#39;t Tom does it&#39;s not a crystal
[1503.64s] ball that I look into it&#39;s just seeing
[1505.76s] this these patterns over and over again
[1507.84s] and recognizing them and being able to
[1510.12s] benefit from them so versus uh buying
[1513.12s] puts you&#39;re buying stocks and then you
[1515.399s] got the enormous rally the next day um
[1519.559s] and uh and that&#39;s a good thing not a bad
[1521.36s] thing you didn&#39;t have to predict the
[1522.48s] election to know that put premium was
[1524.64s] too high uh non-farm payrolls month-
[1527.559s] on-month that was terrible number even
[1529.679s] if you add back the strike and the
[1531.84s] seasonality and you at plus 120 if you
[1534.679s] add 100 112 it&#39;s still fed is aware and
[1539.2s] doing the right thing to alleviate uh
[1541.36s] major weakness in the labor
[1548.6s] market given hurricane
[1551.039s] Distortion okay we covered that Supply
[1554.559s] headwinds are easing for oil inventory
[1557.12s] should be more supportive for oil prices
[1559.559s] we covered that souring profit views
[1562.559s] analysts have been cutting estimates on
[1564.08s] mag 7 earnings growth for next year um
[1568.159s] yeah expect more of that they&#39;re
[1569.6s] spending on investments that are not
[1571.88s] showing a reasonable return on invested
[1574.08s] Capital yet and that&#39;s why I think the
[1576.159s] other businesses that have been starting
[1578.12s] their postco
[1579.88s] recoveries uh are now in a position to
[1583.72s] really take great Advantage so here is
[1585.84s] the slomer report from my friends over
[1587.84s] at
[1589.399s] RBC you know who you are and this is
[1592.08s] just taking a step back we&#39;ve covered
[1593.88s] this many times
[1597.6s] um over the years and uh nothing&#39;s
[1600.84s] changed here and uh this actually points
[1602.84s] to what we actually covered in the
[1604.12s] beginning which this is going to
[1605.36s] continue to run till the early 2030s
[1607.96s] with you know your normal 87 pullbacks
[1610.24s] and all that stuff happens 18 years of
[1613.08s] sideways consolidation like we had from
[1615.6s] uh 2020 to 204 14 give or take uh same
[1620.24s] thing in the 70s same thing in the 30s
[1622.48s] and then you get a couple decades of a
[1624.44s] bull run like you got in the 50s to late
[1627.64s] 60s uh 80s to the to 2000 and uh 2015 to
[1634.32s] you know 2033 2034 something like that
[1638.559s] uh early days lot of money to be made
[1640.96s] and on that basis slomer talking about
[1643.2s] 14,000 on the S&amp;P 500 we&#39;re at uh
[1647.36s] probably 6,000 by the end of the year so
[1650.559s] uh we got a lot of money to make
[1651.919s] together ladies and gentlemen I&#39;m super
[1653.799s] excited I am smiling so wide I could eat
[1656.32s] a banana sideways maybe two banana
[1658.2s] sideways how how&#39;s that for a late
[1659.76s] Thursday night here we go uh a
[1662.08s] repetitive three to four year
[1664.88s] cycle uh so he&#39;s talking about liquidity
[1667.64s] stuff and how they bought them so that&#39;s
[1669.399s] another cycle thing uh uptrend intact
[1672.36s] momentum slowing a little bit all right
[1674.24s] that maybe early next year we&#39;ll see a
[1675.919s] little bit of pullback before people
[1677.399s] have some C uh Clarity on the
[1680.12s] policy here&#39;s his Fibonacci extensions
[1682.799s] we&#39;ve hit the 161.8%
[1708.36s] so uh the this is a good time of the
[1710.32s] year not the time you wanted to be
[1712.0s] buying puts when they were at their most
[1713.76s] expensive highest volatility highest
[1715.64s] price at the exact wrong time a aii bull
[1720.039s] bear survey actually I didn&#39;t look at
[1722.76s] this today let&#39;s take a look at it and
[1724.559s] see where it came
[1726.48s] in um probably 41 okay so it&#39;s up there
[1731.0s] but not Extreme bearishness has ticked
[1733.6s] up a little bit but um okay got it
[1739.55s] [Music]
[1741.24s] uh European stocks breaking out after a
[1744.96s] long cup and handle that&#39;s good to see
[1748.159s] uh no epha e what we got
[1755.84s] here yep and then you got Europe here
[1758.84s] also breaking out of a large cup and
[1760.88s] handle H sang just getting started broke
[1763.679s] the downtrend line back to retested to
[1766.0s] take everyone out next stop 26,26995
[1798.679s] uh again this is counter Trend Maybe I&#39;m
[1800.6s] Wrong maybe it shoots back up here
[1802.08s] before rolling over but I think I think
[1803.679s] we&#39;re done here and the trend is going
[1805.44s] to remain intact for the
[1807.159s] downtrend uh oh it it did it went up to
[1811.039s] this line already this is a couple days
[1812.559s] old so that&#39;s exciting uh dollar same
[1815.72s] story here this is such a tiny counter
[1817.799s] Trend move this is what&#39;s happening
[1819.559s] ladies and gentlemen the trend is down
[1822.48s] uh Trump wants a weak dollar he&#39;ll get a
[1824.12s] weak dollar people are going to get
[1825.36s] caught off sides chasing this stupid
[1828.08s] interpretation of what&#39;s going to take
[1829.679s] place and uh the opposite is actually
[1832.519s] true Canadian dollar have no fear of
[1835.36s] Looney friends relief is on its way and
[1839.32s] uh I would be a buyer of the Looney here
[1841.399s] I&#39;d be the a buyer of the all the
[1843.44s] Emerging Market currencies Australian
[1845.32s] dollar even the Euro uh but that&#39;s not
[1847.96s] our game we don&#39;t have to guess and
[1849.64s] gamble on direction of currencies we can
[1851.88s] actually just buy great companies and
[1853.88s] and play the time Arbitrage
[1855.88s] game uh
[1858.559s] okay gold not for
[1860.799s] me Emerging Markets starting to roll
[1863.48s] China China happens at the bottoming and
[1865.76s] early uptrend cycle uh so we&#39;re excited
[1868.799s] to see that what else energy will be our
[1871.84s] natural gas play Emerging
[1874.08s] Markets healthc carees biotech small
[1876.919s] caps we&#39;re kind of in this group here
[1879.12s] midcaps okay and uh Tech already
[1882.159s] happened so Tech is on the downtrend
[1883.76s] while all this stuff is back on the
[1885.12s] uptrend I love these uh Industry Group
[1888.639s] Cycles uh biotech starting to move Etc
[1893.399s] so that&#39;s that thanks over to the RBC
[1895.96s] people here&#39;s from K fin Alibaba has
[1898.24s] picked up the Steam on its share
[1899.44s] repurchases after accelerating
[1900.88s] repurchases over the last few quarters
[1902.919s] Alibaba has reduced its share count by
[1904.96s] 10% over the previous 12 months this is
[1907.559s] unbelievable ladies and gentlemen which
[1909.679s] means you
[1911.32s] basically uh got 10% more of the pizza
[1914.919s] pie without putting out any more money
[1917.48s] 10 % more share of their cash flow their
[1920.559s] massive 20 to 25 billion dollar a year
[1923.44s] free cash flow is yours 10 to 20 10%
[1926.88s] more of their 80 billion cash flow
[1929.88s] without taking one extra dollar out of
[1932.44s] your pocket um 10% more of your
[1936.559s] ownership of taow t-all the Tollgate for
[1940.2s] the China recovery 10 to 20% more of
[1943.2s] what&#39;ll be the most exciting gross
[1944.88s] business in the next 5 years in China
[1947.279s] which is the Cloud business and the AI
[1949.519s] business in China which which uh Alibaba
[1953.159s] is the biggest the best the baddest uh
[1956.919s] uh player in town and uh it&#39;s going to
[1959.919s] rock and roll so excited to see that
[1961.919s] moving
[1963.0s] on S&amp;P rally is yet to hit average of
[1967.559s] past bull markets oh by the way we
[1970.279s] didn&#39;t finish our charts of the day okay
[1974.2s] uh Ryan Dietrich H here&#39;s how stocks
[1977.399s] have done after the past 24 elections
[1980.08s] basically a year out you&#39;re up on
[1981.76s] average 7% so that tells you that the
[1985.0s] indices are going to not do well why
[1987.44s] because those top 10 weights that make
[1989.76s] up 37% are going to do less well uh and
[1993.519s] maybe negative and then the rest of the
[1995.6s] market can do extremely well and the
[1997.88s] index will still only go up 7% even
[2000.08s] though many of those stocks are going to
[2001.159s] be up 50 plus percent uh and that&#39;s
[2004.399s] going to happen so that&#39;s that
[2007.88s] last three election Cycles you get
[2009.639s] rallies after weakness into the election
[2012.24s] Jason gford Vicks puts was more than 2x
[2015.2s] out of calls on Friday again things you
[2017.84s] see at bottoms not tops Divided We Stand
[2020.96s] United We Stand
[2022.6s] taller uh this is interesting this goes
[2025.6s] against all the data you know most of us
[2028.279s] look at postor War II data from 1955 and
[2031.76s] Beyond but if you actually back up to
[2034.08s] 1928 which is kind of less reliable data
[2037.36s] because the Financial regime was
[2039.32s] different uh but it&#39;s still interesting
[2041.48s] to see if you go back to 1928 a unified
[2045.12s] Republican outcome actually had the
[2049.24s] highest returns of all of the
[2051.679s] outcomes uh if you go back to 1928 if
[2054.599s] you start at 1955 you want a divided
[2056.879s] government but if you go back you know
[2059.359s] close to 100 years on average the best
[2062.639s] outcome by a hair unified Democrat would
[2064.72s] be 9% unified Republican annualized
[2067.56s] return on the S&amp;P 500 would be like 9.25
[2071.32s] so that looks like it&#39;s going to be the
[2073.079s] outcome which again points to the
[2075.2s] positive things we&#39;re seeing positive
[2077.119s] economic surprises return to China the
[2079.879s] gauge turned positive for the first time
[2082.2s] since the beginning of the year we&#39;re
[2084.04s] very happy to see
[2085.639s] that Services turned
[2088.48s] up Hong Kong PMI exploding off the
[2092.119s] charts like we haven&#39;t seen in years uh
[2095.359s] Hong Kong new PMI new orders up
[2098.44s] cumulative daily performance for
[2100.32s] November starting in
[2101.96s] 1950 you can see here some strength in
[2104.72s] the early part of the month a little dip
[2106.68s] in the mid Monon around uh third week
[2110.4s] and then a rally into the end of the
[2112.04s] month same thing with the cumulative
[2114.52s] performance starting in 1990 so it&#39;s the
[2116.359s] same pattern up the first handful of
[2118.56s] days sideways little pullback big rally
[2121.44s] end of the month best month of the year
[2123.599s] large caps trading at a valuation
[2125.76s] premium to history while small caps at a
[2127.8s] discount so large caps over the last 20
[2130.04s] years have averaged 15.8 times they&#39;re
[2131.96s] now at
[2132.96s] 21.5 times whereas small caps have
[2135.68s] average 16.3 times they are now at 15
[2139.32s] times so you can pay a premium and get
[2141.96s] decelerating earnings growth or you can
[2144.079s] pay a discount and get accelerating
[2146.48s] earnings growth same with midcaps your
[2148.839s] call and you&#39;ll see we do have a lot of
[2150.44s] midcaps in the portfolio and one or two
[2152.839s] critical small caps um moving along
[2160.0s] uh we saw this year for the first time
[2162.92s] the uh top five
[2169.359s] contributed about half but the bottom
[2172.52s] 495 actually started to contribute this
[2174.8s] year 11.3% of the gains uh that&#39;s from
[2177.8s] RIT Holtz uh aggregate Bond Futures
[2181.24s] positioning in thousands of contracts so
[2183.0s] we usually cover the commitments of
[2184.8s] Traders on this uh report they&#39;ve just
[2187.64s] assembled the data in a different way
[2189.92s] and if you remember we were pounding the
[2191.839s] hell out of TLT and buying bonds last
[2195.24s] October we got to rip your face off
[2197.28s] rally last time all the hedge funds and
[2200.2s] all of the large Traders were this short
[2203.319s] bonds we are going to get a rally in
[2205.96s] bonds Watch What Happens so we were in
[2209.04s] the market while everyone else was
[2210.88s] selling in the hole popular vote gap
[2213.64s] between candidate elected and runner up
[2216.16s] red notes where the president lost the
[2217.76s] popular Ro okay that was not the case
[2219.88s] this time our strategists expect
[2221.96s] mortgage rates to remain elevated
[2223.76s] falling to 6.1% by the end of next year
[2227.839s] uh yeah that&#39;s probably in line with a
[2230.24s] 4% terminal rate I think that&#39;s kind of
[2232.56s] the name of the game I think you know if
[2235.48s] you can lock in something with a five
[2237.359s] handle high five handle you&#39;re going to
[2239.119s] be happy uh and that&#39;s
[2241.8s] probably I don&#39;t think you&#39;re going to
[2243.48s] see fours this cycle let&#39;s just put it
[2245.24s] that way I think if you get something in
[2246.68s] the fives lock it if you&#39;re wrong you
[2249.079s] refinance if you&#39;re not then
[2253.359s] um then uh then then you&#39;re happy locked
[2256.319s] it in and uh you know even if you don&#39;t
[2259.88s] need a
[2260.88s] mortgage uh sometimes it makes a lot of
[2263.28s] sense to have one because you can make
[2265.88s] the spread you know if you can make 10%
[2268.52s] in with your eyes closed in a passive
[2270.96s] strategy uh and you know you got 6%
[2275.56s] money on a couple million loan you&#39;ve
[2278.76s] got an $80,000 year free cash flow for
[2281.24s] doing nothing uh
[2284.079s] so so that&#39;s kind of nice so if you can
[2286.48s] lock in low Capital that&#39;s what you want
[2288.359s] to do Bloomberg and if you have an
[2290.599s] active strategy which is generating much
[2292.64s] bigger returns you definitely don&#39;t want
[2294.16s] to tie up that million or two million
[2295.76s] bucks uh in in a dead house that&#39;s only
[2298.2s] going to appreciate if you&#39;re lucky at
[2300.72s] you know two three% a year because
[2302.319s] you&#39;ve already had the appreciation in
[2303.8s] the last 3 four years uh versus in the
[2307.0s] markets you can get a lot more and make
[2308.96s] a massive spread so uh use their money
[2312.0s] if they offer it to you Bloomberg us
[2315.68s] 2025 housing starts consensus
[2318.839s] forecast
[2321.24s] uh okay so yeah they&#39;re all saying you
[2323.52s] know they&#39;re never going to build a
[2324.44s] house again you&#39;ll see that&#39;ll change
[2326.28s] bonds will rally this this Market will
[2328.359s] be so on fire it like nobody&#39;s business
[2332.0s] uh covered the daily performance for
[2334.359s] November
[2335.92s] oh daily per performance for November
[2338.599s] starting 1950 in election years so you
[2341.839s] get a
[2343.4s] rally early month and then you get a
[2346.119s] little chop and then you get that rally
[2347.92s] at the end of the year similar to normal
[2349.4s] years little bit of weakness into the 20
[2351.64s] if that seems to be the theme strength
[2353.68s] in the beginning of the month weakness
[2354.92s] into the 20th rip your face off rally to
[2356.64s] the year end so you just sit this stuff
[2358.16s] through I mean I wouldn&#39;t try to get too
[2360.0s] cute with it uh rally Fades after the
[2362.56s] inauguration this is from macr Bond so
[2366.48s] here&#39;s the election we kind of tracked
[2368.56s] exactly what they were talking about and
[2370.96s] then you get a rally through year end uh
[2374.28s] and then after the inauguration you get
[2376.76s] some weakness sideways consolidation for
[2378.839s] the first four or five months before a
[2380.599s] year-end rally in year one so I think
[2383.16s] that&#39;s a fair thing make our money while
[2385.72s] the sun is shining uh through year end
[2388.48s] and then uh Market will be more subdued
[2390.839s] but we&#39;ll be in companies that are just
[2393.0s] taking off and that will help us when
[2395.16s] the mag 7 are doing less well our stuff
[2397.96s] will flourish and I like that setup
[2400.56s] average PE ratio of the top 10 companies
[2402.599s] in the S&amp;P 500 is almost 50 while
[2406.2s] they&#39;re accelerating while their
[2408.079s] earnings growth is accelerating so you
[2410.119s] can buy this stuff because it&#39;s worked
[2411.599s] in the last 10 years but if you buy it
[2414.04s] over the last hundred years you get your
[2416.0s] face ripped off uh so I will take the
[2420.599s] the average of the last 100 years over
[2422.96s] the last last 10 years of data uh any
[2426.0s] day of the week and um this was an
[2428.72s] exception and people are thinking uh
[2431.319s] with recency bias what has persisted in
[2434.64s] recent years will persist indefinitely
[2436.48s] into the future and i&#39; put greater
[2438.2s] weight on the cycles of a 100 years than
[2440.839s] the apparation of 10 uh treasury bond
[2444.96s] bottomed out here starting to rise again
[2447.56s] same story uh that we&#39;ve covered
[2450.28s] institutional client selling has
[2451.8s] typically peaked in October that&#39;s
[2454.4s] because their end of year to book losses
[2456.92s] for mutual funds Etc is at the end of
[2459.92s] that period and mid and small cap
[2466.56s] update so you see it just breaking out
[2468.839s] of this long consolidation cup and
[2471.4s] handle for the technicians
[2473.8s] there 10year yield hitting the top of
[2476.2s] that range which we talked about ready
[2477.64s] to roll back
[2480.319s] over NASDAQ S&amp;P breaking out Russell
[2483.64s] rocking and rolling that&#39;s from Schumer
[2486.48s] over at r BC again Jason goord indices
[2490.079s] soared while the average stock did
[2492.72s] not uh this only happened three unique
[2496.52s] times
[2499.0s] and positive outcomes 12 months later
[2503.28s] average up 14.6 I I don&#39;t that is what
[2506.76s] it is small cap breaking out s small cap
[2509.4s] 600 this is really positive news
[2511.96s] implication is a move to measured move
[2514.96s] of uh 1850 give or take we&#39;re only at
[2518.839s] 1,500 or
[2520.44s] so Dow transports breaking out that&#39;s a
[2523.24s] sign for the health of the overall
[2524.72s] Market that&#39;s good to
[2526.56s] see um consumer discretionary is now
[2529.88s] outperforming Staples we were hammering
[2532.24s] the table on that in September when
[2534.2s] everyone was buying utilities and
[2536.8s] Staples uh at the
[2540.92s] Top China exports through the roof
[2545.68s] today that&#39;s big big
[2550.079s] Improvement value Factor had its best
[2552.359s] day since the worst of the pandemic uh
[2555.76s] basically right after the election
[2557.24s] yesterday so that&#39;s sign of good things
[2559.28s] to come emerging market equities at
[2561.2s] lowest price versus US Equity since
[2564.68s] 1969 uh for those of you around then uh
[2568.359s] absolute fortunes were made in the 70s
[2570.839s] and 80s in Emerging Markets equities
[2573.599s] coming off that level of low
[2575.599s] valuation uh us IPO volume higher under
[2578.88s] Trump before pandemic year so when Trump
[2581.52s] was in office you had massive amounts of
[2583.599s] IPOs uh in the last four years you&#39;ve
[2586.04s] had a collapsing of IPOs after the covid
[2589.28s] spike so expect that to re accelerate
[2591.76s] expect animal spirits to be on the prow
[2594.24s] in
[2595.359s] 2025 GS IPO barometer points to
[2598.319s] improving backdrop for IPO activity
[2601.4s] that&#39;s like asking the haircut asking
[2603.4s] the barber if you need a haircut when
[2605.2s] Goldman Sachs says IPO activities going
[2607.52s] up but they&#39;re probably actually right
[2610.16s] and sometimes when the barber tells you
[2611.88s] you need a haircut he&#39;s right too SNP
[2615.359s] typically rallies after presidential uh
[2617.64s] elections okay we know that uh S&amp;P okay
[2622.079s] here&#39;s the data November is historically
[2624.68s] the best month of the year that&#39;s from
[2626.079s] Carson over at uh Ryan Dietrich over at
[2628.76s] Carson group
[2630.559s] again so we&#39;re seeing that November
[2633.119s] December January are historically the
[2635.0s] best three months of the year so that&#39;s
[2637.319s] why again fully invested and moving
[2641.04s] forward um on to the
[2644.2s] next S&amp;P rally is yet to hit average of
[2647.68s] past bull markets so The Benchmark has
[2650.92s] gained 152% over 50 months on average
[2654.24s] for a bull market so far we&#39;ve only
[2656.44s] gained
[2658.0s] 65% through 25 months so about less than
[2662.0s] half of the returns for less than half
[2664.0s] of the times of the average it can go
[2665.88s] much longer than that as well so that is
[2668.599s] a positive thing quoted here in
[2670.839s] Bloomberg China&#39;s economy shows flashes
[2673.359s] of stimulus taking hold that&#39;s what
[2675.44s] they&#39;ve done before not even what
[2676.96s] they&#39;re going to do moving forward uh
[2679.64s] we&#39;ve talked about some of those data
[2681.0s] points China home sales see first
[2683.2s] monthly rise in 2024 on stimulus value
[2687.24s] of new home sales from biggest
[2688.88s] developers Rose by
[2690.64s] 7.1% sales rebound was lopsided with
[2693.319s] State firms luring buyers by Alibaba
[2696.68s] stock
[2697.76s] has soared it&#39;s still cheap enough to
[2699.8s] buy this is from a different writer at
[2702.28s] Barons named Teresa Rivas who wrote a
[2704.92s] very nice article here uh saying that
[2707.839s] it&#39;s just beginning and we agree Boeing
[2711.319s] strike ends workers set to resume we
[2713.76s] covered that earlier finally that got
[2715.96s] done Fox Corp shares sore as record
[2718.88s] record ad boom ahead of Elections helps
[2721.28s] Revenue beat e
[2723.839s] expectations uh and I will say probably
[2727.04s] the incredibly fantastic content over at
[2729.68s] Fox Business is not hurting them either
[2732.48s] uh I think they do an unbelievable job
[2734.28s] over there and the main station uh you
[2737.079s] know they&#39;re getting a lot of eyeballs
[2738.48s] for sure uh Advanced Auto Parts closes
[2741.599s] the sale of westpack to car which
[2743.599s] basically takes solvency risk off the
[2745.48s] table they got 1.5 billion the CEO is
[2748.559s] doing everything he said he was going to
[2750.04s] do it&#39;s just the Market&#39;s a little bit
[2752.079s] impatient and that&#39;s the design of the
[2754.52s] market is to Simply trans for money from
[2757.64s] the impatient to the patient so let
[2759.64s] everyone sell in the hole in the 30s and

[2811.359s] Simplicity and everything else they had
[2813.2s] a great reporting quarter better than
[2815.64s] expected uh gelsinger was in the market
[2820.079s] uh buying stock again yesterday a
[2822.76s] quarter of a million dollars of stock in
[2825.04s] the market from his own
[2827.48s] checkbook um Jeff uh who works with us
[2831.92s] picked up on that good work and uh and
[2835.28s] that&#39;s that Intel post more than $16
[2837.52s] billion loss but Kitchen in quarter but
[2840.28s] says Outlook is improving that&#39;s why the
[2842.2s] Stock&#39;s up there&#39;s also rumors that
[2843.64s] Qualcomm wants to buy them so was over
[2845.8s] 26 today couldn&#39;t give it away at 18
[2848.44s] everyone wants it at 26 not even
[2850.559s] beginning ladies and gentlemen just the
[2852.24s] beginning Trump like I said to Stuart uh
[2855.92s] Trump is going to want those chips
[2857.599s] manufactured in the US and he&#39;s not
[2859.079s] going to want to give money to Taiwan
[2860.599s] semiconductor to do it he&#39;s going to
[2862.319s] want to give money to Intel to make it
[2864.119s] happen and my guess is musk will be
[2867.04s] supportive of that because musk needs a
[2868.8s] tons ton of chips for his X Ai and other
[2872.839s] things like
[2874.599s] Tesla Beijing puts no price cap on land
[2877.96s] sale signaling property Market shift
[2880.68s] China&#39;s Central Bank affirmed supportive
[2882.48s] monetary policy stance a closely watched

[2890.16s] biggest set of stock account openings
[2893.0s] since 2015 and everyone knows from 2016
[2896.599s] to 2018 the Chinese market went
[2900.04s] parabolic so there you go on to the
[2904.52s] next X congratulates Trump on his
[2907.48s] election as US
[2910.24s] president China urges us cooperation As
[2913.92s] Trump trade threat looms Trump likely to
[2918.079s] upload uphold chips act despite his
[2921.16s] campaign rhetoric policy experts
[2924.2s] say uh Trump probably won&#39;t try to roll
[2927.0s] back the bill Beyond making some
[2928.599s] modifications to its implementation IE
[2931.079s] taking money from Taiwanese companies
[2933.119s] and giving it to the US company China
[2936.2s] October exports Record highest jump in
[2939.079s] 19 months Imports decline more than
[2942.0s] expected
[2944.64s] uh don&#39;t know what article was going to
[2947.16s] be
[2949.319s] here ant International drives AI in
[2952.799s] crossb payments to boost Global
[2957.76s] expansion Trump 60% tariffs on Chinese
[2961.04s] Goods to cut Chinese economic growth by
[2963.44s] 2 percentage points so that&#39;s amazing
[2965.64s] when you think about 60% tariffs you
[2967.359s] think it would like destroy their
[2968.799s] economy even if the worst case scenario
[2971.079s] and it&#39;s not posturing which it always
[2972.96s] is uh and they can&#39;t make a deal which
[2975.2s] he always does uh two percentage points
[2977.839s] could be made up by stimulus pretty
[2979.88s] reasonably
[2982.52s] quickly and they would still be at plus
[2984.559s] 3% GDP growth which is above where we
[2986.64s] are so that&#39;s that&#39;s great and that&#39;s
[2988.64s] priced in now so anything wor better
[2990.68s] than that is going to be a boon for a
[2993.4s] rally what m&amp;a will look like under
[2995.68s] Trump Administration it will be non-stop
[2997.839s] Lena KH is in involuntary retirement uh
[3002.04s] she is gonzo and uh it&#39;s going to be the
[3005.079s] wild west again uh companies will be
[3007.52s] consolidating like crazy Regional banks
[3009.28s] will be the number one target expect to
[3011.079s] see a thousand less Banks and a lot of
[3013.2s] opportunity and that K is going to be
[3014.96s] the big beneficiary of that
[3017.119s] consolidation uh how Trump Donald Trump
[3019.559s] won by being Donald Trump this was in
[3021.359s] the Wall Street Journal and I pointed
[3023.559s] this out not to be political but rather
[3025.799s] as a lot of young people listen uh I
[3029.559s] think that&#39;s how you&#39;re going to have
[3030.64s] your greatest success in life you know
[3032.76s] God or whoever you believe in put you
[3034.92s] here with a unique set of attributes and
[3038.4s] aspects that are unique to you and when
[3041.2s] you&#39;re young there is a tendency to try
[3044.0s] to be like someone else that you emulate
[3046.68s] and certainly you should mimic the
[3050.16s] characteristics that made them
[3052.28s] successful I.E the work ethic the the
[3055.839s] habits the the Frameworks the things
[3058.319s] that made them successful but you have
[3060.799s] to create your own style your own Unique
[3063.48s] Edge your own personality otherwise it
[3065.76s] will come across as inauthentic and it
[3067.839s] simply won&#39;t work I mean ducks are meant
[3070.2s] to quack that&#39;s all they do if you had a
[3072.28s] barking duck it would be the strangest
[3074.16s] duck that you&#39;d ever seen and uh uh I
[3078.359s] think that&#39;s what uh Trump has figured
[3080.2s] out he he doesn&#39;t change who he is and I
[3082.799s] think that&#39;s a lesson to all of us uh is
[3085.88s] really just being yourself your
[3088.48s] incredible self uh and doing things with
[3091.52s] your own style your own Pizzazz your own
[3094.24s] way of doing it will bring you far
[3096.44s] greater rewards than trying to be
[3098.44s] someone that you&#39;re not so uh that&#39;s our
[3101.359s] message of the week uh how to trade the
[3105.0s] post elction post rate cut melted
[3108.559s] up stocks are set to Rally further blah
[3112.0s] blah
[3112.88s] blah what did I even want to cover with
[3115.799s] this
[3118.319s] I don&#39;t know buy small caps uh how Trump
[3121.52s] 2.0 could push the this Roaring 20s
[3124.079s] stock market into roaring 2030s that&#39;s
[3126.92s] from y Denny that&#39;s in line with some of
[3128.96s] the things that we&#39;re saying his reasons
[3130.72s] to be bullish taxes and spending uh gon
[3133.64s] to try to lower the corporate r tax rate
[3135.88s] to 15% which immediately boosts earnings
[3138.839s] dramatically uh in uh meanwhile musk is
[3142.04s] going to cut two trillion or at least
[3143.64s] try to cut$ two trillion dollar a cost
[3145.799s] that&#39;s why
[3147.2s] uh that&#39;s going to be very positive
[3148.599s] inflation and energy deregulation these
[3152.28s] are the things we covered on Stu anyway
[3154.52s] here&#39;s a statement of what changed at
[3155.839s] the FED meeting this week uh the
[3158.52s] statement labor conditions have
[3160.76s] generally eased prior to that they said
[3163.44s] slowed inflation has made progress uh he
[3166.88s] didn&#39;t say further progress so he&#39;s
[3168.799s] acknowledging kind of its it&#39;s
[3170.559s] flatlining at a low level uh in support
[3178.2s] decided to lower that in support of the
[3180.559s] committee its
[3182.079s] goals okay so they took out progress on
[3184.359s] inflation and balance of risk they just
[3186.119s] said the
[3187.16s] goals and they had no dissent so that
[3189.72s] was positive and they moved ahead
[3191.359s] proving that they in fact are and a
[3193.44s] political organization which they had
[3195.28s] been questioned about historically and
[3198.319s] now have uh proven with the
[3199.96s] follow-through today which was a big
[3203.359s] one and they did so with no descent a
[3206.839s] new day stock market and sentiment
[3208.4s] results this is the
[3210.599s] post-election uh pre-inauguration
[3213.04s] pattern that we covered followed after
[3215.04s] the inauguration a little bit of
[3216.559s] sideways and then a yearend rally so
[3218.599s] that&#39;s kind of our fra initial framework
[3220.64s] for next year uh notes ahead of the
[3223.119s] segment I planned to cover a lot more
[3225.0s] but we ran short on time because the
[3226.92s] political commentator before me uh had a
[3229.44s] lot to say after the election which
[3230.92s] makes perfect sense uh small caps
[3233.319s] Regional Banks Intel Boeing favorite
[3236.0s] small cap app is Cooper standard which
[3237.559s] we&#39;re going to talk about and I said oil
[3239.64s] servicers we don&#39;t own any we probably
[3241.48s] don&#39;t even intend to own any but if you
[3244.0s] had to play energy that&#39;s the way to do
[3246.319s] it uh in our
[3249.76s] view uh key will be election results we
[3252.44s] covered that covered that covered that
[3256.4s] Bond seasonality we covered a few weeks
[3258.28s] ago worst in October best in November
[3261.96s] Alibaba friendly reminder to all the
[3263.92s] nervous Nellies out there regarding
[3265.359s] Trump&#39;s tariffs on China we&#39;ve seen this
[3267.559s] movie before we covered this chart a few
[3269.319s] weeks ago Trump takes office in uh
[3272.28s] January 2017 and puts tariffs on China
[3275.44s] what happens to Alibaba it goes up
[3281.96s] 350% uh excuse me four Forex 300% over
[3288.319s] the next four years while he&#39;s in office
[3291.4s] uh that&#39;s pretty amazing Cooper standard
[3294.48s] and China will announce there proactive
[3296.799s] stimulus on Friday when the
[3297.92s] administration changed Alibaba collapsed
[3300.44s] obviously there were other exogenous
[3302.0s] events but it goes to show you for
[3304.359s] everyone afraid of tariffs and sold down
[3306.839s] in anticipation of tariffs sold down in
[3309.24s] anticipation of tariffs uh they&#39;re going
[3311.319s] to miss it Cooper standard click here
[3313.48s] for the most recent update on Cooper
[3315.16s] okay so you can go back to all of our
[3316.52s] original thesis when we initiated the
[3318.76s] position at
[3320.16s] $542
[3321.92s] $542 in May of
[3324.799s] 2022 um and yet yet this thing is still
[3327.28s] just getting started even at $16 up 3x
[3331.96s] 200% Cooper standard reports third
[3334.359s] quarter results so bottom line here and
[3337.4s] we could spend a huge amount of time on
[3339.4s] this I think we&#39;re not going to and I
[3341.64s] think the reason we&#39;re not going to go
[3343.359s] to do that is that I&#39;m going to give you
[3347.52s] the key theme here and the key theme is
[3350.44s] the
[3351.48s] execution of this
[3354.76s] management um
[3361.4s] has been nothing short of spectacular in
[3364.16s] an
[3365.119s] unbelievably difficult environment and
[3367.319s] difficult environment that&#39;s going to
[3368.2s] change very quickly it&#39;s going to change
[3369.52s] for a few reasons number one the FED is
[3371.92s] cutting rates they&#39;re going to continue
[3373.079s] to cut rates that&#39;s going to lower car
[3375.0s] loans faster than it&#39;s going to lower
[3376.64s] mortgage loans because mortgages are
[3378.119s] priced off the 10year car loans are the
[3380.079s] overnight plus whatever um that&#39;s number
[3383.319s] one number two Trump made a campaign
[3386.319s] pain promise and if he actually gets a
[3388.559s] red sweep he could deliver on to make
[3391.48s] interest payments on cars car payments
[3394.28s] tax deductible so people are going to
[3397.319s] buy a ton of cars because the average
[3399.76s] car on the road is 13 and a half years
[3401.76s] plus uh that will be volumes probably
[3405.44s] like we&#39;ve never seen since 2017 when
[3408.799s] Cooper standard was
[3410.4s] $146 stock uh and now that they&#39;ve taken
[3415.359s] out so many of the costs uh they could
[3419.68s] probably out earn 2017 they earned
[3423.96s] $7.20 uh per share that year they could
[3427.28s] probably out out earn it by 50 plus
[3429.64s] percent on the same volumes now so it&#39;s
[3432.48s] just a question what multiple is going
[3433.72s] to be on the stock 10 or 20 times uh at
[3436.4s] the peak and that is exciting but the
[3438.799s] key thing I want to point out they
[3440.28s] generated 16.9 million of free cash flow
[3442.4s] last quarter that&#39;s unbelievable given
[3443.799s] that the volumes came in worse than
[3445.119s] expected they were expecting 15.8
[3447.599s] million cars industrywide in North
[3449.64s] America at the beginning of the year
[3451.319s] they&#39;re they&#39;re now expecting 15.5 and
[3453.839s] on that collapse of 300,000 which was
[3456.76s] unexpected they were still able to hold
[3459.319s] up their adjusted eida guidance of 180
[3462.52s] to one uh basically midpoint uh being
[3465.28s] the same with a dramatic drop in cars
[3468.16s] and remember when they once they get
[3469.4s] over 158 that&#39;s kind of their Break Even
[3471.76s] everything goes to the bottom line so on
[3473.28s] every 300 uh th000 cars
[3477.44s] um two 300,000 cards we&#39;re going to
[3479.88s] we&#39;re going to see three three bucks of
[3482.079s] earnings per share which is going to be
[3484.16s] staggering it won&#39;t be perfect after you
[3485.92s] get over the first few hundred, cars but
[3488.359s] that implies that by the time they get
[3489.92s] to 16 and a half they could be earning
[3491.559s] seven bucks at least and um and God
[3495.079s] forbid they get to a 2017 peak in
[3498.16s] Industry volumes of over 17 the thing
[3500.839s] could be earning 14 bucks a share I mean
[3503.359s] it is amazing the operating leverage
[3505.68s] embedded in this so I&#39;m super excited
[3508.0s] but what I&#39;m more excited about is the
[3511.28s] fact
[3512.319s] that
[3518.319s] um in
[3521.52s] 2023 they had 15.6 million
[3525.72s] cars and they generated 167 million of
[3530.48s] ibida we&#39;re going to have less industry
[3533.88s] volume in 2024
[3536.44s] and they&#39;re going to
[3537.96s] dramatically
[3539.96s] improve eida
[3542.119s] growth from 167 to midpoint call it 187
[3546.839s] so they&#39;re going to have 20 million more
[3549.039s] of iida this year on Less Car volume
[3553.039s] when this car volume goes up to
[3556.0s] 158 161 164 167 17 this is going to be a
[3563.76s] money making machine it&#39;s going to be
[3566.76s] like a water a fire hose of cash
[3569.92s] flooding out and knocking people over I
[3572.76s] am I mean I couldn&#39;t tell you how
[3575.44s] excited I am about this and this goes to
[3578.319s] the other thing is that inventories are
[3580.16s] building so we&#39;re going to see more and
[3581.68s] more incentives we&#39;re going to see lower
[3583.64s] rates we&#39;re going to see uh more volume
[3587.88s] and maybe we&#39;ll get the tax
[3589.2s] deductibility of interest uh uh payments
[3592.119s] on cars from
[3593.64s] Trump it&#39;s it&#39;s setting up to be
[3595.799s] something something super exciting so uh
[3599.319s] it is what it is and um and I couldn&#39;t
[3602.28s] be happier so kudos to management for
[3605.2s] weathering a really difficult
[3606.839s] environment I love how they&#39;ve handled
[3608.72s] it and I would strongly encourage you to
[3610.48s] read every single green highlighted
[3614.799s] thing that I put in this article and
[3616.359s] took four or five hours yesterday to go
[3618.559s] through for you that we&#39;re we&#39;re just
[3620.92s] not going to go through word by word let
[3622.72s] me see if I can catch ah despite the
[3625.039s] current headwinds we believe that both
[3626.72s] of our product segments remain on track
[3629.039s] to achieve double digigit return on
[3631.559s] invested Capital as we exit 2025 and if
[3634.799s] you go back to our initial thesis two
[3637.76s] years ago two two and a half years ago
[3642.16s] uh the number one thing that we said we
[3644.44s] we got involved is because management
[3646.28s] understood return on invested capital
[3648.48s] and their plan was to get back to double
[3650.0s] digits and they&#39;re doing everything they
[3651.599s] said they&#39;re going to do despite volumes
[3654.039s] coming back more slowly than in
[3655.96s] anticipated they&#39;ve just stopped making
[3657.4s] excuses and started delivering in any
[3659.599s] way they can and wait till wait till
[3662.599s] these volumes tick up just to hair
[3664.44s] what&#39;s goingon to happen to the
[3666.2s] bottom anyway it&#39;s it&#39;s super exciting
[3670.44s] um double digit margin we&#39;re going to be
[3672.88s] there as we exit in
[3676.0s] 2025
[3678.039s] uh G we agree I mean this is just super
[3682.079s] exciting stuff what else did I want to
[3684.24s] see here
[3687.44s] um
[3690.4s] contribution I mean they&#39;re making more
[3692.4s] with less Vehicles because their
[3693.72s] Technologies improved that if the OEM
[3696.839s] pays them more money for their
[3700.039s] part they still have an overall lower
[3703.64s] cost per
[3705.039s] vehicle for the OEM even though Cooper
[3707.88s] standard gets more of that cost per
[3709.68s] vehicle because of their innovation has
[3711.279s] been so great so it&#39;s it&#39;s an offer they
[3713.839s] can&#39;t refuse as you know I grew up in
[3715.359s] New Jersey uh that had a different
[3717.359s] meeting but uh you know Cooper sard
[3721.2s] keeps doing it and uh and we&#39;re going to
[3723.119s] see the volumes they&#39;re paying full cash
[3725.559s] interest they&#39;re not doing any pick that
[3727.2s] just shows their level of confidence
[3728.88s] they&#39;ll refinance early in the year now
[3731.039s] that rates are coming
[3732.64s] down
[3734.16s] uh restructuring
[3737.92s] SES
[3739.58s] [Music]
[3740.88s] volumes oh and basically
[3747.359s] the analysts were asking the same
[3748.92s] question that I asked which
[3752.52s] was okay it&#39;s incredible you got all
[3754.72s] these costs out of this business it&#39;s
[3756.24s] it&#39;s a miracle you&#39;re generating
[3757.72s] positive free cash flow with such low
[3760.119s] volumes but when the volumes go up is
[3763.48s] that all going to go to the bottom line
[3764.92s] and is this going to be a cash machine
[3766.279s] or the cost just going to go up with it
[3768.2s] and what he&#39;s implying here is the costs
[3769.88s] are what the costs are we can we can
[3771.96s] basically deliver as much as we want
[3773.92s] which effectively means that every
[3775.92s] marginal unit above 15.8 uh goes
[3778.599s] straight to the bottom line so do the
[3780.799s] math cars cost the benefit per car
[3784.319s] depending on the mix $150 to $200 per
[3787.76s] car 300,000 cars so it it just starts to
[3792.599s] Mint uh fear and greed is not near an
[3794.76s] extreme yet which is why this thing can
[3796.799s] keep pushing higher grinding higher and
[3799.24s] burning through all that put premium
[3800.76s] here&#39;s Ginger&#39;s Insider buy utilities
[3803.44s] earnings top 30 weights were revised up
[3805.799s] in the last 60 days REITs revised down
[3809.4s] uh 59 bips in the last 60 days di
[3812.4s] Minimus uh economic data I think we
[3814.68s] covered most of this and uh earnings up
[3819.079s] 5.1% estimates came down to 175 so
[3822.24s] keeping an eye on that and now on to the
[3826.48s] ask me anything questions so if you
[3829.64s] don&#39;t like to ask me anything thank you
[3831.24s] for tuning in we&#39;ll be back next week
[3832.799s] same time same place if you do love the
[3835.16s] ask me anything which so many of you do
[3837.72s] uh stick around we&#39;re just getting
[3840.0s] started
[3842.24s] so let&#39;s go through
[3845.68s] these and our first one comes
[3857.0s] from Nate
[3859.839s] Kelsey Tom you&#39;ve been looking for
[3862.68s] restaurants take a gander at rrg B
[3866.4s] they&#39;ve been working on a
[3867.839s] turnaround also appreciate your thoughts
[3870.279s] on
[3871.04s] [Music]
[3873.24s] L uh thank you as always I look forward
[3875.64s] to the podcast every week okay try to
[3877.44s] keep it to one each week ladies and
[3879.279s] Gentlemen Just to be fair because we do
[3881.4s] have limited time and a lot of people
[3883.48s] have been getting in questions but I
[3886.44s] will candle these for you Nate so what
[3889.24s] is this Red Robin we&#39;ve C covered Red
[3891.279s] Robin this is not for me I first off I
[3894.319s] don&#39;t even like their product but but
[3896.64s] secondly
[3908.0s] um no there&#39;s no sign of a cash flow
[3910.44s] turnaround this thing is this is not for
[3912.52s] me H same same answer I gave a few weeks
[3915.359s] ago
[3919.599s] L Leed and plat this one is more
[3922.96s] interesting um it&#39;s furniture
[3926.48s] they had a lot of pull forward during Co
[3929.4s] it&#39;s going to take a while to turn the
[3930.72s] corner but I do kind of like this one
[3932.559s] the cash flow is still going down
[3933.76s] revenues are going down margins are
[3935.119s] going down but on balance I think they
[3937.24s] can weather it until the cycle turn and
[3940.24s] it&#39;s a highly cyclical
[3942.079s] business uh but I think their balance
[3944.799s] sheet is
[3946.799s] okay
[3950.0s] uh
[3951.88s] abilities yeah it&#39;s not perfect but they
[3954.079s] should be fine
[3957.24s] um yeah that one&#39;s a pretty good one so
[3960.2s] I wouldn&#39;t you know pretty good meaning
[3963.48s] it&#39;s worthwhile to start to do a few
[3966.079s] weeks of work to determine if you&#39;re
[3968.16s] going to make a meaningful investment in
[3969.88s] it so uh good job on that
[3974.96s] neat okay on to the next
[3978.17s] [Music]
[3979.68s] Maryanne uh hi new listener this year
[3984.279s] and love the podcast that&#39;s Marian nap
[3987.44s] thank you Maran uh thank you for what
[3989.119s] you do for retail investors like me I&#39;m
[3991.359s] interested to hear your thoughts on
[3992.88s] square and block Maran well Marian I&#39;m
[3995.52s] super happy to do it for retail
[3997.079s] investors and to to keep this in
[4000.16s] perspective there are a lot of very
[4002.359s] wealthy business people that listen to
[4004.359s] this every week a a lot of very large
[4007.079s] family offices and institutions that
[4008.799s] listen to this every week uh and I love
[4012.52s] the retail investors who stick with this
[4015.68s] and uh lose the get-rich quick mindset
[4018.279s] and uh find a way to build durable
[4021.119s] wealth over time uh if they apply a more
[4024.2s] principled framework uh to that is
[4026.96s] repeatable over time it can help them go
[4029.44s] a long way
[4031.12s] [Music]
[4032.839s] um all right block look we own PayPal we
[4036.16s] think it&#39;s a much better quality
[4037.44s] business run by a better operator uh
[4040.0s] block to me is probably going to work as
[4042.76s] well but it&#39;s a lower quality business
[4045.24s] with uh less attractive management and
[4049.279s] um but on the on the mend as well so
[4052.44s] they probably have a better crypto play
[4054.68s] in uh block but that&#39;s not our belly
[4058.279s] Wick either in terms of
[4061.2s] expertise
[4063.16s] um so I&#39;m for me it&#39;s a pass but I I
[4067.76s] think it&#39;ll probably
[4069.359s] work um but um it&#39;s you know
[4075.72s] I I just
[4077.72s] think they&#39;ve never historically had a
[4081.68s] decent return on Capital block PayPal
[4084.16s] has always consistently had a solid
[4085.92s] return on Capital it&#39;s a higher-end
[4087.92s] business in PayPal over blocks so uh for
[4092.559s] me I think square is much more of a
[4095.16s] commodity than PayPal is um PayPal has
[4099.08s] Brand value data value all the other
[4101.719s] things that we&#39;ve covered in recent
[4102.88s] weeks so that that&#39;s where I would play
[4104.759s] but uh
[4106.52s] Square might work for a trade but it&#39;s
[4108.6s] it&#39;s it&#39;s just not not for us but thank
[4111.12s] you so much for the great question and
[4113.199s] uh you&#39;ll be able to discern better and
[4115.04s] better over time as you listen over the
[4117.199s] years uh hello there no that&#39;s not
[4122.239s] that
[4124.56s] Drew joining the number of stocks of
[4126.759s] good valuations grateful for your
[4128.0s] thoughts on FMC at current valuation not
[4131.199s] correlated with China I like it I&#39;ve
[4133.96s] looked at it uh um I think it&#39;s
[4138.56s] fine it&#39;s an a play we&#39;ve covered it I
[4141.359s] think in some of the podcasts and I also
[4143.0s] said I liked it so yeah I I have no
[4145.319s] problem with that one
[4150.12s] um but do do material work before you
[4154.64s] invest any material
[4158.48s] money
[4160.04s] Drew
[4162.759s] okay rean no
[4171.92s] okay
[4173.799s] Calvin
[4176.04s] no and I get a lot of
[4178.44s] emails Nick
[4179.96s] [Music]
[4184.6s] G long time listen and followed you chy
[4187.359s] to play very grateful for it please shed
[4189.12s] some light on dren Miller&#39;s Bond short
[4192.0s] position look inflation
[4197.84s] really value opinion perspective look
[4208.04s] um dry Miller is an absolute Legend I
[4210.719s] would never bet against Dr and Miller I
[4212.44s] will say
[4220.96s] that I&#39;ll just say that I disagree with
[4223.239s] the view and we&#39;ll see how it plays out
[4224.64s] over the next 20 4 months moving along
[4228.28s] um
[4231.4s] Matt Matt sent me a very nice note Matt
[4234.159s] I replied for that I don&#39;t know if you
[4235.6s] got my reply but I really appreciate
[4237.48s] that amazing note um very very grateful
[4240.44s] for that uh Tom could you please look at
[4242.88s] wns Holdings this is from rajash sub r
[4248.12s] manum
[4259.12s] okay I feel like we looked at this but
[4260.88s] let&#39;s take another look at it wns
[4291.52s] business Process Management provides
[4293.64s] data voice and analytical
[4295.679s] transformation uh
[4298.44s] manufact shipping Logistics okay so this
[4301.92s] is a
[4303.88s] compl complicated business it&#39;s based in
[4307.639s] India um
[4319.159s] looks like they&#39;re into a hundred
[4320.36s] different things look the financials
[4322.12s] look perfect on this India is a slight
[4324.48s] red flag for me uh there were a lot of
[4327.36s] frauds with some of the Outsourcing
[4328.92s] companies and over the years this looks
[4332.48s] like amazing perfect numbers so on a
[4336.28s] numbers basis I love everything about it
[4338.719s] but I really have to dig in and
[4341.08s] understand every aspect of their
[4342.6s] business and what&#39;s the competitive Moe
[4344.639s] and get real confidence in the numbers
[4346.88s] but this might be a cheaper way to play
[4348.56s] an overvalued Market in China uh so I
[4352.28s] think that&#39;s a good find I think you
[4354.04s] have to do a lot of work really dig into
[4356.28s] Management&#39;s
[4357.6s] backgrounds uh and whether they had
[4359.719s] success in in creating value for
[4361.719s] shareholders or if they were just
[4364.199s] promoters um and uh if you can get
[4367.88s] comfortable in the Integrity of
[4369.639s] management uh you probably have a decent
[4371.719s] business then you got to get comfort in
[4373.32s] the durability of their MO and what&#39;s
[4375.8s] going to keep competitors at Bay and if
[4378.92s] you can get confidence in those couple
[4380.56s] of things which is reflected in their
[4382.719s] numbers I think you might have something
[4384.4s] good here so that was a nice find
[4387.239s] Rees and uh let&#39;s see Stephen
[4390.52s] Kim longtime listener and fan of the
[4393.0s] podcast great to see the Intel
[4394.92s] investment working out as you&#39;ve laid
[4396.719s] out throughout the year what do you
[4399.199s] thoughts on asml
[4406.159s] um yeah it&#39;s had a small correction look
[4410.199s] asml is a great business with very
[4411.96s] little
[4413.239s] competition uh I don&#39;t think it&#39;s coming
[4415.28s] enough i&#39; I&#39;d take a hard look at it at
[4417.719s] 500 400 but um I don&#39;t know if it&#39;ll
[4421.12s] ever get there so it&#39;s just not cheap
[4422.56s] enough for me to make a double over two
[4423.96s] or three years so for that reason just a
[4426.84s] pass for now but I&#39;ll keep an eye on
[4428.36s] that one and nice
[4430.0s] find
[4433.48s] um Steve rampton who does the incredible
[4436.92s] videos you see every
[4438.56s] day uh sent in last week Estee
[4447.639s] louder and we we did respond to that one
[4450.44s] we like that one at these levels it can
[4452.679s] go lower before it goes higher but this
[4454.4s] is adorable brand for a hundred years
[4457.36s] that um has a lot of competition but
[4460.96s] it&#39;s
[4462.159s] basically hurting because of China and
[4464.48s] China&#39;s coming back so this is basically
[4467.159s] you know it&#39;s like buying another Baba
[4469.48s] basically and uh Baba&#39;s ready to roll so
[4472.36s] I I like EST louder uh they just put the
[4475.4s] new CEO people aren&#39;t happy because it
[4477.12s] was an Insider but it&#39;s a guy who knows
[4478.76s] the business backwards and forwards and
[4480.6s] he knows how to run the business when uh
[4483.32s] China recovers which it&#39;s starting to
[4485.4s] now and maybe accelerate by what happens
[4487.36s] over the next
[4488.679s] week and um It&#39;s a Brand that&#39;s uh you
[4492.92s] know they&#39;ve got Mac they&#39;ve got so much
[4495.08s] much other stuff so if you believe in
[4496.84s] China you want to be in this if you
[4498.08s] don&#39;t believe in China you don&#39;t want to
[4499.4s] be in it uh the risk at these levels
[4502.52s] which I&#39;m willing to certainly take is
[4505.4s] that uh the new CEO comes in and does a
[4508.199s] massive kitchen SN quarter in his first
[4510.08s] quarter to clear the deck so he takes a
[4512.4s] huge loss uh before doing it but I think
[4515.679s] people are kind of expecting that so it
[4517.36s] might already be priced into the stock
[4519.52s] uh but certainly could go a little bit
[4520.84s] lower before it starts to recover and
[4522.719s] this is an early early early days of
[4525.199s] recovery but with this kind of quality
[4527.08s] of a franchise if China turns this
[4529.36s] thing&#39;s going to rip fast so uh I think
[4532.0s] you got a good one here Stephen and um
[4535.0s] uh thanks for sending it in and thanks
[4536.48s] for all the amazing work you do on the
[4539.32s] videos um as well so with that said
[4542.639s] we&#39;ll be back next week same time same
[4544.76s] place hope to meet a couple of you in
[4547.12s] Dallas in the meantime make it a great
