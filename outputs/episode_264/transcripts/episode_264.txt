welcome to hedge fun tips with Tom Hayes I&#39;m Tom Hayes and this is your 264th videoast podcast for the week ending November 7th 2024 we got a lot of great stuff to cover today family first uh this is Mimi and Annabelle Annabelle started 68 water polo Academy part-time and loves it she&#39;s by far the youngest athlete ever admitted but because of her speed they gave her a spot Mimi flew to Chicago today with her coach and the 908 water Polo Club to compete in the Champions Cup this pre prestigious tournament brings together top middle school players from clubs across the country who each qualified from their respective zones the winners of each Zone face off in the Champions Cup to determine the ultimate Champion 908 is entering the tournament as the number one seed so very very proud of them and let&#39;s see what else we got this week uh that&#39;s Mimi at Portillos I know that&#39;s been an ask me anything question for uh some time and that&#39;s one of Mimi&#39;s favorite they have the Chicago style dogs which is appropriate because she&#39;s in Chicago this week and that is the studio where uh vanney and Co is shot so you can see behind the scenes that&#39;s the desk we sit on that&#39;s Stu vanney in the background uh very excited so let&#39;s get down to Media first and foremost I want to thank Stu Barney I want to thank Preston myelle and I want to thank Christian dagger for having me on varne and Company Fox Business this week right after the election uh at the top of the hour 9:00 a.m. started the show we talked about H the implications of the election results so we&#39;re going to tune in here left hand side of your screen that&#39;s Dow that&#39;s a stock futures I mean they&#39;re way up 1,200 points up for the Dow over 116 for the S&amp;P that&#39;s a rally and a half it&#39;s a trump rally let&#39;s be obvious about it Tom Hayes joins with this morning checking out the market for us it&#39;s a trump rally obviously how long does it last well that&#39;s a great question this is what lower regulation and lower taxes look like Stuart uh I wouldn&#39;t chase this up immediately but I think this is a a a sign of great things to come over the next four years no question about it uh the opportunities here obviously you&#39;re seeing small caps outperform this morning up 6% we like Regional Banks that&#39;s going to continue to flourish uh and Intel is interestingly enough I know I&#39;ve brought this up on the show remember when it collapsed below 20 and I said steu I think it&#39;s a buy here it&#39;s trading below breakup value it&#39;s up 42% why because Trump is going to want to manufacture those chips in the United States and reduce our dependency on Taiwan for our chips that&#39;s a national security thing and another one that again no one likes is Boeing Boeing was up 300% during Trump&#39;s first term this is a hated stock right now they&#39;ve just resolved the rally I think there&#39;s going to be opportunity there as well you&#39;re assuming that Trump has something to do with a turnaround for Boeing I&#39;m not sure Bo is a proxy for us manufacturing and Trump is All About Us manufacturing this is going to be a manufacturing friendly environment there are going to be policies that are going to be manufacturing friendly and when you unleash American inity and Manufacturing good things happen why is not a good idea to buy bonds at the moment why why buy bonds when you&#39;ve got stocks ring like this well no question about it however uh what we&#39;re seeing in the bond market is the positioning is so short uh from hedge funds and from large Traders they are the most short that they&#39;ve been bonds since October of last year and following that there was a ripy face off rally in Bonds in November and December of last year so I think after this initial shock effect as after the market settles out in the next few days we also have the FED on Thursday that&#39;s a that&#39;s a big decision fed will continue to cut probably have to cut less than the market is pricing in right now but they will continue to cut I think there is an opportunity to selectively buy Bonds in the coming days not immediately today this is the shock effect but with as much as they&#39;ve come in in the last month there&#39;s opportunity there as well look at that yield on the tenure 446 how about that it was 36 few weeks ago that&#39;s something else Tom thanks for much indeed thank you Ste President elect Trump calling and we&#39;re back and then I want to thank chabuk ogu who quoted me in his article today for Reuters regarding the FED cut today definitely want to read that one over at hedge fund tips.com and then want to thank Luca blowman for including me in her article on Alibaba and uh and the turnaround just beginning just uh that uh quotes of the week before we get down to it uh first from Warren Buffett the stock market is a device from transferring money from the impatient to the patient so many people are shaking out of great stocks due to bad headlines because they don&#39;t know what they own they haven&#39;t done the financial analysis they haven&#39;t done the research analysis and on this podcast every week we do our best to share some ideas with uh parts of our framework how you can do that and uh for many of you it&#39;s helped quite a bit and we&#39;ve been getting such amazing letters and feedback very very grateful for that uh my idea of a great business is one that has a shortage of competitors that&#39;s from Peter Lynch and that&#39;s why we keep pounding the table on Boeing the strike is over they did do some dilution but it only takes the share count back to 2014 levels they&#39; bought in a ton of stock and as soon as the cash flow SP it turns on they&#39;re going to buy in all that stock once again uh so hang in there they&#39;ve got a 10-year backlog a half a trillion dollars there&#39;s not a whole lot to think about there Warren Buffett it&#39;s better to hang out with people better than you pick out Associates whose behavior is better than yours and you&#39;ll drift in that direction that&#39;s from Warren Buffett and and that&#39;s been my rule you know as I&#39;ve said many times on this uh video cast I&#39;ve never optimized for maximum AUM and and certainly it&#39;s been rolling in and we&#39;re very very grateful for that but you know the reason I do that intro call with everyone that inquires about investing each quarter is because I want to work for people that I am super excited about when I wake up every morning to make money for them I like them I respect respect them I admire them and each and every one of them is better than me in their own respective areas of expertise so I learn from them and they&#39;re just winners across the board uh and that that&#39;s how I&#39;ve created my Mastermind is attracting amazing clients and friends around me who have many have become friends um through uh all of the things that go into the podcast and referrals and um uh uh getting to know people so it&#39;s just been an unbelievable blessing and um and it&#39;s right from the master himself Warren Buffett speaking of which I will be in Dallas on Sunday and Monday I fly in super early on Sunday uh great clients of mine invited me to the Dallas Cowboys game so excited to go to their box and um uh enjoy the game and then Sunday we are playing the PGA course in Frisco Texas uh which is unbelievable they&#39;re going to have the rider cup there I believe in 2042 so

this is all opinion not advice we do not know your financial situation we deal with qualified clients and institutions and accredited investors only and uh so there&#39;s all of that for you moving along onto our charts of the week of course our favorite reporter uh at our favorite publication I put a quote in favorite reporter and underline under favorite publication favorite publication is Baron favorite reporter with constant negative headlines uh about China has their newest People&#39;s National Congress is expected to okay fiscal stimulus but will it be enough uh okay so let&#39;s get down to some of these charts and for those of you whove been around you remember three weeks ago we went through uh it was something like a 100 consecutive negative headlines about China from this particular reporter for uh three years basically is is what it comes down to and the interesting thing is they put a new reporter on the beat and we&#39;re going to go through her headlines because she actually had something very positive to say about Alibaba uh at a 100 bucks after it&#39;s you know uh U come up from from its lows at 58 um and uh we&#39;re grateful to see that uh change in uh shift in in Outlook and we&#39;ll start to see more and more people get on board as it goes from 100 back to 120 to 140 to 160 to 180 at 200 people will really hate it because they&#39;ve missed it and they&#39;ll hate it all and then by 300 everyone will love it and we&#39;ll be laying it off so uh same plan since day one some happen faster than you expect some happen slower than you expect but let&#39;s get down to some new charts here uh here&#39;s a chart from someone called D chart life and it&#39;s uh the biotech xbi which we&#39;ve had for some time and um it shows here we bought in the hole uh 2022 and then it rallied straight up we thought we were Geniuses until it retested those lows again in 2023 and then it ripo rally did a minor base and now it looks like it&#39;s going to break out for good here so it&#39;s up off the lows from the 60s to now 103 and uh he&#39;s got a Target line of 130 because of this resistance or whatever the hell it is uh I think this is going to work its way higher than that over time so that that story is just beginning and we&#39;ve been patient with that uh while everyone else sold Down in the Hole here and then sold Down in the Hole again here and then bought up here sold Down in the Hole here uh what is the stock market it is a device for transferring money from the impatient to the patient and that&#39;s exactly what&#39;s happening with biotech uh Matt Sur minaro works for um Tom Lee he put this out uh NASDAQ Composite just had 14% of its members make 52 we highs we tend to see this sort of breath TR in maturing bull markets like the one we have now good sign for Bulls so you can see these instances 1 2 3 4 5 six and this is the seventh uh where you just see continued follow through which is positive China Equity Funds see the outflow for the third straight week just in time for the China stimulus tomorrow to offset the Trump fear uh I think they&#39;ll do something reasonably sizable tomorrow but based on the numbers we&#39;ve been seeing in their economy their export numbers uh the numbers that came in this week uh it was absolutely uh uh it&#39;s moving on its own and the additional Insurance stimulus that they&#39;re going to put out tomorrow will just add add turbo boost to what&#39;s already happening great financial crisis pushed stock allocations below the traditional 60 to 65% ban they still haven&#39;t recovered so when you think about getting to euphor points uh you could start saying that in the 60 above 65 which we saw in the uh Tech peak in 2000 and then in the banking peak in 65 we are nowhere in that neighborhood ladies and gentlemen which tells me uh and with all the positive developments from a policy standpoint that there&#39;s a lot more juice to this over the coming years there will be pull there will be 10% pullbacks are every year there will be 20% Corrections that happens maybe even 30% but I think from now through early 2030s and we&#39;ve talked about the demographics over and over uh the path of least resistance is up because the bulk of our population is in their still in their early 30s and that spending should not slow as as a matter of fact it accelerates all the way to their early 30s so another solid 6 eight plus years that we can make unbelievable amounts of money in a short period of time together and I&#39;m very very excited about that uh here is the equity sentiment it improved in October but it&#39;s not at extreme levels just yet uh UK government biggest fiscal loosening since 2009 so they are turning the stimulus Jets on that will help gxo where 50% of their revenues are top 10 stocks are 37% of the S&amp;P so we started to see before the election some hiccups among those stocks um I think I think that more likely than not we will see a lot of continued breath which began this summer and has continued um that&#39;s going to enable the mag 7 to kind of perform more modestly relative to what they&#39;ve done off the 2022 lows and allow those that are just getting started to really really accelerate and and a lot of these turnarounds to become full recoveries and uh and return to profitable growth again which we hear a lot in the conference calls largest US deficit since the Great Depression World War II how did they get out of that they inflated their way out of it so expect 3 to 4% uh or you know 275 to 3.5% for the next four or five years that&#39;ll be great it will bring down debt to GDP probably down to about 80 75% we saw a similar situation from uh 1948 to 1956 actually it dropped to 57 from 120% so uh we&#39;re on the same Playbook boj signals more rate hikes as it sees uh receded overseas risks that will be negative for Japanese equities that will be positive for Chinese equities all of that Asia money crowded into Japan in uh when China was locked down now will be forced back in as prices go up and more and more sentiment shifts in the Articles and uh commentary and narrative Etc and you&#39;re seeing the China manufacturing PMI turned positive again uh manufacturing orders ripped higher in China uh bull bear indicator again it&#39;s bullish but it&#39;s not at an extreme yet which means there&#39;s probably some gas left in the tank and seasonally this is the time of year that it happens uh election our three contrarian pushbacks this is from haret one of the best in the business uh he says if we get a red sweep uh it&#39;s best played via small cap that was similar to what I was talking to Stu about um and best played via China Tech well we are overweight both of those and it looks like we are going to actually wind up with the red sweep so surging excess liquidity will soon buoy oil prices we tend to agree we do think there&#39;s probably some opportunity in the servicers that benefit from volumes versus the producers that benefit from Price uh I I wouldn&#39;t I wouldn&#39;t bet against a big price increase in oil uh but I also wouldn&#39;t bet for it so I would play it the safe way uh which is that a lot more of it&#39;s going to be pumped and uh you want to play the pick and shovels versus the uh versus the ones taking it out of the ground one of the most important charts in energy policy now in our view this is from Bank of America and they talk about energy source and return on invested Capital by source and as you can see the worst return on invested Capital are wind biomass and solar expect to see less of that in the next four years and the highest return on invested Capital are nuclear Hydro coal and natural gas expect to see more of that in coming years nuclear is the cheapest clean energy when all costs considered and US economic growth extends solid streak GDP cow Rose at 2.8% annual return in the third quarter also speaks to what we said there would be a lull in uh earnings this quarter although they&#39;re up over 5% relative to 4.2% expectations and then a massive reacceleration to double digits in Q4 which seems to be playing out Chinese manufacturing again a different the official indicator back up back into expansion above 50 China Factory activity expands for the first time since April official survey shows that&#39;s different from the Kon survey which I&#39;m probably slaughtering the name pronunciation but you know what I&#39;m an American I am what I am India over Chinese equities has collapsed in the last few months we talked about that the hot money is going to come out of India and back into China as price goes up and opinion follows trend a solid 2% beat with surprisingly strong guidance oh 2% above estimates so it was 4.2 they&#39;re saying it&#39;s 6.2 fact said saying it&#39;s 5.2 okay it&#39;s better than expected it&#39;s not blowout better than expected we had been beating by 3% now we&#39;re beating by 2% but you can see sector by sector mentions of bottom surge in the earnings calls this quarter which historically indicated an EPS bottoming cycle which we have been talking about publicly for the last few weeks that Q3 would be a bottoming and then a re acceleration corporate sentiment indicator fell so far this earning season but it&#39;s at record highs so it&#39;s nothing to be alarmed about it&#39;s just cooling a little bit like it does in every bull market Trend coming off of recovery boom to new highs a little check back like we had here and then a pullback and then you keep going the indic indicator suggests 12% year-on-year EPS in Q4 versus 9% consensus and then you can see here the lull of the unmagnify uh the deceleration of The Magnificent 7 in terms of earnings growth and then the massive reacceleration over the next few quarters for uh unmagnify and the stabilization of the freefall of The Magnificent Seven earnings growth due to all the Tech spend pause before re acceleration eight out of 11 sectors are expected to see decelerating earnings growth in Q3 and then you see the reacceleration in Q4 so the worst are expected to be Industrials energy and materials and then next next quarter they all rebound materials for instance from negative 8 9% to plus 11 we&#39;re playing that through albamar as we&#39;ve talked about then you&#39;ve got uh Industrials uh -6 to -1 and then you got group you have groups like uh financials jumping we&#39;re playing that through the KR the uh Regional basket which we bought in that meltdown in 2023 and then um what else here another utilities are expect to re re accelerate so they&#39;ll have to sell off more for for me to get interested demand recovery equals higher margins uh so we are seeing that easing rate pressure should translate into a pickup in manufacturing uh we got another cut today as expected this is speaks very highly of the FED who have now proven themselves to be an apolitical organization meaning they followed through with expectations and the plan irrespective of their guesses about future policy Andor the results of the election so kudos to them uh as I&#39;ve said since day one which was a minority opinion which is now becoming a closer to a consensus opinion is that our terminal rate would be much higher than the market had anticipated uh Market was saying the terminal rate would be around three I think they will be done around four because growth will be strong enough and that&#39;s what happens in a midcycle cut like 1995 you don&#39;t need a ton 125 150 bips is enough to get the machine going and preserve the job falling mortgage rates also suggest a pickup in housing so they peaked yesterday they&#39;re coming back down uh just like when I said with um Stu wait for it to settle out a day or so and then buy bonds I think you I think it&#39;s a good time to buy bonds and as a matter of fact we had uh slugs of new money from existing clients come in and uh we were able to get a little exposure there as well um falling mortgage rate suggest a pick up in housing that will help J which is doing fantastic that will help Stanley Black and&amp; Decker which is on track with their plan just not fast enough for Wall Street so the impatient sell to us and the patient stick with it and cash out at a double Plus in a year in two years and three years it doesn&#39;t really matter um uh worst of the inventory destocking cycle is likely behind us so you say well we miss you you say well then I missed it because Tom was talking about that that it was going to bottom a year ago and we&#39;ve had this huge rally yes we have but look historically there&#39;s a lot of time after you get from these depression type of uh um destocking Cycles to restocking that you get years of upward bull market after that bottom so we haven&#39;t even got over the midline yet and uh and then even after that you get more and more and more so this is the beginning we are just getting started this I got a aged extremely well I put this out on Monday morning uh which was the day before the election and uh I said I wonder if all these put buyers ahead of the election are going to get paid with a funny face I don&#39;t know whatever Emoji uh history does not suggest it the 2024 put call ratio followed by second post of 2016 put call ratio and third post of 2020 put call ration ratio not to worry whoever is elected will take credit so you can see here that the put call ratio got up it actually got up spiked that day at 130 uh which is Extreme there was so much fear and then uh same thing in 2016 before Trump got elected it spiked up to 140 uh and then same thing in 2016 even with Biden it spiked up to 120 right before the election and then what did you see a collapse in in uh vix and a rally in S&amp;P collapse in vix rally in S&amp;P collapse in vix rally in S&amp;P why do you get that all at once is because uh you catch the whole Market off sides and there&#39;s no way the the sellers of that premium are letting these people get get paid when everyone crowded in to pay the most expensive price at the exact wrong time for insurance they got they&#39;re they got smoked okay so happens every time and so this wasn&#39;t Tom does it&#39;s not a crystal ball that I look into it&#39;s just seeing this these patterns over and over again and recognizing them and being able to benefit from them so versus uh buying puts you&#39;re buying stocks and then you got the enormous rally the next day um and uh and that&#39;s a good thing not a bad thing you didn&#39;t have to predict the election to know that put premium was too high uh non-farm payrolls month- on-month that was terrible number even if you add back the strike and the seasonality and you at plus 120 if you add 100 112 it&#39;s still fed is aware and doing the right thing to alleviate uh major weakness in the labor market given hurricane Distortion okay we covered that Supply headwinds are easing for oil inventory should be more supportive for oil prices we covered that souring profit views analysts have been cutting estimates on mag 7 earnings growth for next year um yeah expect more of that they&#39;re spending on investments that are not showing a reasonable return on invested Capital yet and that&#39;s why I think the other businesses that have been starting their postco recoveries uh are now in a position to really take great Advantage so here is the slomer report from my friends over at RBC you know who you are and this is just taking a step back we&#39;ve covered this many times um over the years and uh nothing&#39;s changed here and uh this actually points to what we actually covered in the beginning which this is going to continue to run till the early 2030s with you know your normal 87 pullbacks and all that stuff happens 18 years of sideways consolidation like we had from uh 2020 to 204 14 give or take uh same thing in the 70s same thing in the 30s and then you get a couple decades of a bull run like you got in the 50s to late 60s uh 80s to the to 2000 and uh 2015 to you know 2033 2034 something like that uh early days lot of money to be made and on that basis slomer talking about 14,000 on the S&amp;P 500 we&#39;re at uh probably 6,000 by the end of the year so uh we got a lot of money to make together ladies and gentlemen I&#39;m super excited I am smiling so wide I could eat a banana sideways maybe two banana sideways how how&#39;s that for a late Thursday night here we go uh a repetitive three to four year cycle uh so he&#39;s talking about liquidity stuff and how they bought them so that&#39;s another cycle thing uh uptrend intact momentum slowing a little bit all right that maybe early next year we&#39;ll see a little bit of pullback before people have some C uh Clarity on the policy here&#39;s his Fibonacci extensions we&#39;ve hit the 161.8% so uh the this is a good time of the year not the time you wanted to be buying puts when they were at their most expensive highest volatility highest price at the exact wrong time a aii bull bear survey actually I didn&#39;t look at this today let&#39;s take a look at it and see where it came in um probably 41 okay so it&#39;s up there but not Extreme bearishness has ticked up a little bit but um okay got it [Music] uh European stocks breaking out after a long cup and handle that&#39;s good to see uh no epha e what we got here yep and then you got Europe here also breaking out of a large cup and handle H sang just getting started broke the downtrend line back to retested to take everyone out next stop 26,26995 uh again this is counter Trend Maybe I&#39;m Wrong maybe it shoots back up here before rolling over but I think I think we&#39;re done here and the trend is going to remain intact for the downtrend uh oh it it did it went up to this line already this is a couple days old so that&#39;s exciting uh dollar same story here this is such a tiny counter Trend move this is what&#39;s happening ladies and gentlemen the trend is down uh Trump wants a weak dollar he&#39;ll get a weak dollar people are going to get caught off sides chasing this stupid interpretation of what&#39;s going to take place and uh the opposite is actually true Canadian dollar have no fear of Looney friends relief is on its way and uh I would be a buyer of the Looney here I&#39;d be the a buyer of the all the Emerging Market currencies Australian dollar even the Euro uh but that&#39;s not our game we don&#39;t have to guess and gamble on direction of currencies we can actually just buy great companies and and play the time Arbitrage game uh okay gold not for me Emerging Markets starting to roll China China happens at the bottoming and early uptrend cycle uh so we&#39;re excited to see that what else energy will be our natural gas play Emerging Markets healthc carees biotech small caps we&#39;re kind of in this group here midcaps okay and uh Tech already happened so Tech is on the downtrend while all this stuff is back on the uptrend I love these uh Industry Group Cycles uh biotech starting to move Etc so that&#39;s that thanks over to the RBC people here&#39;s from K fin Alibaba has picked up the Steam on its share repurchases after accelerating repurchases over the last few quarters Alibaba has reduced its share count by 10% over the previous 12 months this is unbelievable ladies and gentlemen which means you basically uh got 10% more of the pizza pie without putting out any more money 10 % more share of their cash flow their massive 20 to 25 billion dollar a year free cash flow is yours 10 to 20 10% more of their 80 billion cash flow without taking one extra dollar out of your pocket um 10% more of your ownership of taow t-all the Tollgate for the China recovery 10 to 20% more of what&#39;ll be the most exciting gross business in the next 5 years in China which is the Cloud business and the AI business in China which which uh Alibaba is the biggest the best the baddest uh uh player in town and uh it&#39;s going to rock and roll so excited to see that moving on S&amp;P rally is yet to hit average of past bull markets oh by the way we didn&#39;t finish our charts of the day okay uh Ryan Dietrich H here&#39;s how stocks have done after the past 24 elections basically a year out you&#39;re up on average 7% so that tells you that the indices are going to not do well why because those top 10 weights that make up 37% are going to do less well uh and maybe negative and then the rest of the market can do extremely well and the index will still only go up 7% even though many of those stocks are going to be up 50 plus percent uh and that&#39;s going to happen so that&#39;s that last three election Cycles you get rallies after weakness into the election Jason gford Vicks puts was more than 2x out of calls on Friday again things you see at bottoms not tops Divided We Stand United We Stand taller uh this is interesting this goes against all the data you know most of us look at postor War II data from 1955 and Beyond but if you actually back up to 1928 which is kind of less reliable data because the Financial regime was different uh but it&#39;s still interesting to see if you go back to 1928 a unified Republican outcome actually had the highest returns of all of the outcomes uh if you go back to 1928 if you start at 1955 you want a divided government but if you go back you know close to 100 years on average the best outcome by a hair unified Democrat would be 9% unified Republican annualized return on the S&amp;P 500 would be like 9.25 so that looks like it&#39;s going to be the outcome which again points to the positive things we&#39;re seeing positive economic surprises return to China the gauge turned positive for the first time since the beginning of the year we&#39;re very happy to see that Services turned up Hong Kong PMI exploding off the charts like we haven&#39;t seen in years uh Hong Kong new PMI new orders up cumulative daily performance for November starting in 1950 you can see here some strength in the early part of the month a little dip in the mid Monon around uh third week and then a rally into the end of the month same thing with the cumulative performance starting in 1990 so it&#39;s the same pattern up the first handful of days sideways little pullback big rally end of the month best month of the year large caps trading at a valuation premium to history while small caps at a discount so large caps over the last 20 years have averaged 15.8 times they&#39;re now at 21.5 times whereas small caps have average 16.3 times they are now at 15 times so you can pay a premium and get decelerating earnings growth or you can pay a discount and get accelerating earnings growth same with midcaps your call and you&#39;ll see we do have a lot of midcaps in the portfolio and one or two critical small caps um moving along uh we saw this year for the first time the uh top five contributed about half but the bottom 495 actually started to contribute this year 11.3% of the gains uh that&#39;s from RIT Holtz uh aggregate Bond Futures positioning in thousands of contracts so we usually cover the commitments of Traders on this uh report they&#39;ve just assembled the data in a different way and if you remember we were pounding the hell out of TLT and buying bonds last October we got to rip your face off rally last time all the hedge funds and all of the large Traders were this short bonds we are going to get a rally in bonds Watch What Happens so we were in the market while everyone else was selling in the hole popular vote gap between candidate elected and runner up red notes where the president lost the popular Ro okay that was not the case this time our strategists expect mortgage rates to remain elevated falling to 6.1% by the end of next year uh yeah that&#39;s probably in line with a 4% terminal rate I think that&#39;s kind of the name of the game I think you know if you can lock in something with a five handle high five handle you&#39;re going to be happy uh and that&#39;s probably I don&#39;t think you&#39;re going to see fours this cycle let&#39;s just put it that way I think if you get something in the fives lock it if you&#39;re wrong you refinance if you&#39;re not then um then uh then then you&#39;re happy locked it in and uh you know even if you don&#39;t need a mortgage uh sometimes it makes a lot of sense to have one because you can make the spread you know if you can make 10% in with your eyes closed in a passive strategy uh and you know you got 6% money on a couple million loan you&#39;ve got an $80,000 year free cash flow for doing nothing uh so so that&#39;s kind of nice so if you can lock in low Capital that&#39;s what you want to do Bloomberg and if you have an active strategy which is generating much bigger returns you definitely don&#39;t want to tie up that million or two million bucks uh in in a dead house that&#39;s only going to appreciate if you&#39;re lucky at you know two three% a year because you&#39;ve already had the appreciation in the last 3 four years uh versus in the markets you can get a lot more and make a massive spread so uh use their money if they offer it to you Bloomberg us 2025 housing starts consensus forecast uh okay so yeah they&#39;re all saying you know they&#39;re never going to build a house again you&#39;ll see that&#39;ll change bonds will rally this this Market will be so on fire it like nobody&#39;s business uh covered the daily performance for November oh daily per performance for November starting 1950 in election years so you get a rally early month and then you get a little chop and then you get that rally at the end of the year similar to normal years little bit of weakness into the 20 if that seems to be the theme strength in the beginning of the month weakness into the 20th rip your face off rally to the year end so you just sit this stuff through I mean I wouldn&#39;t try to get too cute with it uh rally Fades after the inauguration this is from macr Bond so here&#39;s the election we kind of tracked exactly what they were talking about and then you get a rally through year end uh and then after the inauguration you get some weakness sideways consolidation for the first four or five months before a year-end rally in year one so I think that&#39;s a fair thing make our money while the sun is shining uh through year end and then uh Market will be more subdued but we&#39;ll be in companies that are just taking off and that will help us when the mag 7 are doing less well our stuff will flourish and I like that setup average PE ratio of the top 10 companies in the S&amp;P 500 is almost 50 while they&#39;re accelerating while their earnings growth is accelerating so you can buy this stuff because it&#39;s worked in the last 10 years but if you buy it over the last hundred years you get your face ripped off uh so I will take the the average of the last 100 years over the last last 10 years of data uh any day of the week and um this was an exception and people are thinking uh with recency bias what has persisted in recent years will persist indefinitely into the future and i&#39; put greater weight on the cycles of a 100 years than the apparation of 10 uh treasury bond bottomed out here starting to rise again same story uh that we&#39;ve covered institutional client selling has typically peaked in October that&#39;s because their end of year to book losses for mutual funds Etc is at the end of that period and mid and small cap update so you see it just breaking out of this long consolidation cup and handle for the technicians there 10year yield hitting the top of that range which we talked about ready to roll back over NASDAQ S&amp;P breaking out Russell rocking and rolling that&#39;s from Schumer over at r BC again Jason goord indices soared while the average stock did not uh this only happened three unique times and positive outcomes 12 months later average up 14.6 I I don&#39;t that is what it is small cap breaking out s small cap 600 this is really positive news implication is a move to measured move of uh 1850 give or take we&#39;re only at 1,500 or so Dow transports breaking out that&#39;s a sign for the health of the overall Market that&#39;s good to see um consumer discretionary is now outperforming Staples we were hammering the table on that in September when everyone was buying utilities and Staples uh at the Top China exports through the roof today that&#39;s big big Improvement value Factor had its best day since the worst of the pandemic uh basically right after the election yesterday so that&#39;s sign of good things to come emerging market equities at lowest price versus US Equity since 1969 uh for those of you around then uh absolute fortunes were made in the 70s and 80s in Emerging Markets equities coming off that level of low valuation uh us IPO volume higher under Trump before pandemic year so when Trump was in office you had massive amounts of IPOs uh in the last four years you&#39;ve had a collapsing of IPOs after the covid spike so expect that to re accelerate expect animal spirits to be on the prow in 2025 GS IPO barometer points to improving backdrop for IPO activity that&#39;s like asking the haircut asking the barber if you need a haircut when Goldman Sachs says IPO activities going up but they&#39;re probably actually right and sometimes when the barber tells you you need a haircut he&#39;s right too SNP typically rallies after presidential uh elections okay we know that uh S&amp;P okay here&#39;s the data November is historically the best month of the year that&#39;s from Carson over at uh Ryan Dietrich over at Carson group again so we&#39;re seeing that November December January are historically the best three months of the year so that&#39;s why again fully invested and moving forward um on to the next S&amp;P rally is yet to hit average of past bull markets so The Benchmark has gained 152% over 50 months on average for a bull market so far we&#39;ve only gained 65% through 25 months so about less than half of the returns for less than half of the times of the average it can go much longer than that as well so that is a positive thing quoted here in Bloomberg China&#39;s economy shows flashes of stimulus taking hold that&#39;s what they&#39;ve done before not even what they&#39;re going to do moving forward uh we&#39;ve talked about some of those data points China home sales see first monthly rise in 2024 on stimulus value of new home sales from biggest developers Rose by 7.1% sales rebound was lopsided with State firms luring buyers by Alibaba stock has soared it&#39;s still cheap enough to buy this is from a different writer at Barons named Teresa Rivas who wrote a very nice article here uh saying that it&#39;s just beginning and we agree Boeing strike ends workers set to resume we covered that earlier finally that got done Fox Corp shares sore as record record ad boom ahead of Elections helps Revenue beat e expectations uh and I will say probably the incredibly fantastic content over at Fox Business is not hurting them either uh I think they do an unbelievable job over there and the main station uh you know they&#39;re getting a lot of eyeballs for sure uh Advanced Auto Parts closes the sale of westpack to car which basically takes solvency risk off the table they got 1.5 billion the CEO is doing everything he said he was going to do it&#39;s just the Market&#39;s a little bit impatient and that&#39;s the design of the market is to Simply trans for money from the impatient to the patient so let everyone sell in the hole in the 30s and they&#39;ll buy back from us over a 100 moving on uh H Chinese single day shopping Festival is more than halfway over

is improving that&#39;s why the Stock&#39;s up there&#39;s also rumors that Qualcomm wants to buy them so was over 26 today couldn&#39;t give it away at 18 everyone wants it at 26 not even beginning ladies and gentlemen just the beginning Trump like I said to Stuart uh Trump is going to want those chips manufactured in the US and he&#39;s not going to want to give money to Taiwan semiconductor to do it he&#39;s going to want to give money to Intel to make it happen and my guess is musk will be supportive of that because musk needs a tons ton of chips for his X Ai and other things like Tesla Beijing puts no price cap on land sale signaling property Market shift China&#39;s Central Bank affirmed supportive monetary policy stance a closely watched meeting uh Chinese Traders rush to open Stock accounts amid stimulus push biggest set of stock account openings since 2015 and everyone knows from 2016 to 2018 the Chinese market went parabolic so there you go on to the next X congratulates Trump on his election as US president China urges us cooperation As Trump trade threat looms Trump likely to upload uphold chips act despite his campaign rhetoric policy experts say uh Trump probably won&#39;t try to roll back the bill Beyond making some modifications to its implementation IE taking money from Taiwanese companies and giving it to the US company China October exports Record highest jump in 19 months Imports decline more than expected uh don&#39;t know what article was going to be here ant International drives AI in crossb payments to boost Global expansion Trump 60% tariffs on Chinese Goods to cut Chinese economic growth by 2 percentage points so that&#39;s amazing when you think about 60% tariffs you think it would like destroy their economy even if the worst case scenario and it&#39;s not posturing which it always is uh and they can&#39;t make a deal which he always does uh two percentage points could be made up by stimulus pretty reasonably quickly and they would still be at plus 3% GDP growth which is above where we are so that&#39;s that&#39;s great and that&#39;s priced in now so anything wor better than that is going to be a boon for a rally what m&amp;a will look like under Trump Administration it will be non-stop Lena KH is in involuntary retirement uh she is gonzo and uh it&#39;s going to be the wild west again uh companies will be consolidating like crazy Regional banks will be the number one target expect to see a thousand less Banks and a lot of opportunity and that K is going to be the big beneficiary of that consolidation uh how Trump Donald Trump won by being Donald Trump this was in the Wall Street Journal and I pointed this out not to be political but rather as a lot of young people listen uh I think that&#39;s how you&#39;re going to have your greatest success in life you know God or whoever you believe in put you here with a unique set of attributes and aspects that are unique to you and when you&#39;re young there is a tendency to try to be like someone else that you emulate and certainly you should mimic the characteristics that made them successful I.E the work ethic the the habits the the Frameworks the things that made them successful but you have to create your own style your own Unique Edge your own personality otherwise it will come across as inauthentic and it simply won&#39;t work I mean ducks are meant to quack that&#39;s all they do if you had a barking duck it would be the strangest duck that you&#39;d ever seen and uh uh I think that&#39;s what uh Trump has figured out he he doesn&#39;t change who he is and I think that&#39;s a lesson to all of us uh is really just being yourself your incredible self uh and doing things with your own style your own Pizzazz your own way of doing it will bring you far greater rewards than trying to be someone that you&#39;re not so uh that&#39;s our message of the week uh how to trade the post elction post rate cut melted up stocks are set to Rally further blah blah blah what did I even want to cover with this I don&#39;t know buy small caps uh how Trump 2.0 could push the this Roaring 20s stock market into roaring 2030s that&#39;s from y Denny that&#39;s in line with some of the things that we&#39;re saying his reasons to be bullish taxes and spending uh gon to try to lower the corporate r tax rate to 15% which immediately boosts earnings dramatically uh in uh meanwhile musk is going to cut two trillion or at least try to cut$ two trillion dollar a cost that&#39;s why uh that&#39;s going to be very positive inflation and energy deregulation these are the things we covered on Stu anyway here&#39;s a statement of what changed at the FED meeting this week uh the statement labor conditions have generally eased prior to that they said slowed inflation has made progress uh he didn&#39;t say further progress so he&#39;s acknowledging kind of its it&#39;s flatlining at a low level uh in support decided to lower that in support of the committee its goals okay so they took out progress on inflation and balance of risk they just said the goals and they had no dissent so that was positive and they moved ahead proving that they in fact are and a political organization which they had been questioned about historically and now have uh proven with the follow-through today which was a big one and they did so with no descent a new day stock market and sentiment results this is the post-election uh pre-inauguration pattern that we covered followed after the inauguration a little bit of sideways and then a yearend rally so that&#39;s kind of our fra initial framework for next year uh notes ahead of the segment I planned to cover a lot more but we ran short on time because the political commentator before me uh had a lot to say after the election which makes perfect sense uh small caps Regional Banks Intel Boeing favorite small cap app is Cooper standard which we&#39;re going to talk about and I said oil servicers we don&#39;t own any we probably don&#39;t even intend to own any but if you had to play energy that&#39;s the way to do it uh in our view uh key will be election results we covered that covered that covered that Bond seasonality we covered a few weeks ago worst in October best in November Alibaba friendly reminder to all the nervous Nellies out there regarding Trump&#39;s tariffs on China we&#39;ve seen this movie before we covered this chart a few weeks ago Trump takes office in uh January 2017 and puts tariffs on China what happens to Alibaba it goes up 350% uh excuse me four Forex 300% over the next four years while he&#39;s in office uh that&#39;s pretty amazing Cooper standard and China will announce there proactive stimulus on Friday when the administration changed Alibaba collapsed obviously there were other exogenous events but it goes to show you for everyone afraid of tariffs and sold down in anticipation of tariffs sold down in anticipation of tariffs uh they&#39;re going to miss it Cooper standard click here for the most recent update on Cooper okay so you can go back to all of our original thesis when we initiated the position at $542 $542 in May of 2022 um and yet yet this thing is still just getting started even at $16 up 3x 200% Cooper standard reports third quarter results so bottom line here and we could spend a huge amount of time on this I think we&#39;re not going to and I think the reason we&#39;re not going to go to do that is that I&#39;m going to give you the key theme here and the key theme is the execution of this management um has been nothing short of spectacular in an unbelievably difficult environment and difficult environment that&#39;s going to change very quickly it&#39;s going to change for a few reasons number one the FED is cutting rates they&#39;re going to continue to cut rates that&#39;s going to lower car loans faster than it&#39;s going to lower mortgage loans because mortgages are priced off the 10year car loans are the overnight plus whatever um that&#39;s number one number two Trump made a campaign pain promise and if he actually gets a red sweep he could deliver on to make interest payments on cars car payments tax deductible so people are going to buy a ton of cars because the average car on the road is 13 and a half years plus uh that will be volumes probably like we&#39;ve never seen since 2017 when Cooper standard was $146 stock uh and now that they&#39;ve taken out so many of the costs uh they could probably out earn 2017 they earned $7.20 uh per share that year they could probably out out earn it by 50 plus percent on the same volumes now so it&#39;s just a question what multiple is going to be on the stock 10 or 20 times uh at the peak and that is exciting but the key thing I want to point out they generated 16.9 million of free cash flow last quarter that&#39;s unbelievable given that the volumes came in worse than expected they were expecting 15.8 million cars industrywide in North America at the beginning of the year they&#39;re they&#39;re now expecting 15.5 and on that collapse of 300,000 which was unexpected they were still able to hold up their adjusted eida guidance of 180 to one uh basically midpoint uh being the same with a dramatic drop in cars and remember when they once they get over 158 that&#39;s kind of their Break Even everything goes to the bottom line so on every 300 uh th000 cars um two 300,000 cards we&#39;re going to we&#39;re going to see three three bucks of earnings per share which is going to be staggering it won&#39;t be perfect after you get over the first few hundred, cars but that implies that by the time they get to 16 and a half they could be earning seven bucks at least and um and God forbid they get to a 2017 peak in Industry volumes of over 17 the thing could be earning 14 bucks a share I mean it is amazing the operating leverage embedded in this so I&#39;m super excited but what I&#39;m more excited about is the fact that um in 2023 they had 15.6 million cars and they generated 167 million of ibida we&#39;re going to have less industry volume in 2024 and they&#39;re going to dramatically improve eida growth from 167 to midpoint call it 187 so they&#39;re going to have 20 million more of iida this year on Less Car volume when this car volume goes up to 158 161 164 167 17 this is going to be a money making machine it&#39;s going to be like a water a fire hose of cash flooding out and knocking people over I am I mean I couldn&#39;t tell you how excited I am about this and this goes to the other thing is that inventories are building so we&#39;re going to see more and more incentives we&#39;re going to see lower rates we&#39;re going to see uh more volume and maybe we&#39;ll get the tax deductibility of interest uh uh payments on cars from Trump it&#39;s it&#39;s setting up to be something something super exciting so uh it is what it is and um and I couldn&#39;t be happier so kudos to management for weathering a really difficult environment I love how they&#39;ve handled it and I would strongly encourage you to read every single green highlighted thing that I put in this article and took four or five hours yesterday to go through for you that we&#39;re we&#39;re just not going to go through word by word let me see if I can catch ah despite the current headwinds we believe that both of our product segments remain on track to achieve double digigit return on invested Capital as we exit 2025 and if you go back to our initial thesis two years ago two two and a half years ago uh the number one thing that we said we we got involved is because management understood return on invested capital and their plan was to get back to double digits and they&#39;re doing everything they said they&#39;re going to do despite volumes coming back more slowly than in anticipated they&#39;ve just stopped making excuses and started delivering in any way they can and wait till wait till these volumes tick up just to hair what&#39;s goingon to happen to the bottom anyway it&#39;s it&#39;s super exciting um double digit margin we&#39;re going to be there as we exit in 2025 uh G we agree I mean this is just super exciting stuff what else did I want to see here um contribution I mean they&#39;re making more with less Vehicles because their Technologies improved that if the OEM pays them more money for their part they still have an overall lower cost per vehicle for the OEM even though Cooper standard gets more of that cost per vehicle because of their innovation has been so great so it&#39;s it&#39;s an offer they can&#39;t refuse as you know I grew up in New Jersey uh that had a different meeting but uh you know Cooper sard keeps doing it and uh and we&#39;re going to see the volumes they&#39;re paying full cash interest they&#39;re not doing any pick that just shows their level of confidence they&#39;ll refinance early in the year now that rates are coming down uh restructuring SES [Music] volumes oh and basically the analysts were asking the same question that I asked which was okay it&#39;s incredible you got all these costs out of this business it&#39;s it&#39;s a miracle you&#39;re generating positive free cash flow with such low volumes but when the volumes go up is that all going to go to the bottom line and is this going to be a cash machine or the cost just going to go up with it and what he&#39;s implying here is the costs are what the costs are we can we can basically deliver as much as we want which effectively means that every marginal unit above 15.8 uh goes straight to the bottom line so do the math cars cost the benefit per car depending on the mix $150 to $200 per car 300,000 cars so it it just starts to Mint uh fear and greed is not near an extreme yet which is why this thing can keep pushing higher grinding higher and burning through all that put premium here&#39;s Ginger&#39;s Insider buy utilities earnings top 30 weights were revised up in the last 60 days REITs revised down uh 59 bips in the last 60 days di Minimus uh economic data I think we covered most of this and uh earnings up 5.1% estimates came down to 175 so keeping an eye on that and now on to the ask me anything questions so if you don&#39;t like to ask me anything thank you for tuning in we&#39;ll be back next week same time same place if you do love the ask me anything which so many of you do uh stick around we&#39;re just getting started so let&#39;s go through these and our first one comes from Nate Kelsey Tom you&#39;ve been looking for restaurants take a gander at rrg B they&#39;ve been working on a turnaround also appreciate your thoughts on [Music] L uh thank you as always I look forward to the podcast every week okay try to keep it to one each week ladies and Gentlemen Just to be fair because we do have limited time and a lot of people have been getting in questions but I will candle these for you Nate so what is this Red Robin we&#39;ve C covered Red Robin this is not for me I first off I don&#39;t even like their product but but secondly um no there&#39;s no sign of a cash flow turnaround this thing is this is not for me H same same answer I gave a few weeks ago L Leed and plat this one is more interesting um it&#39;s furniture they had a lot of pull forward during Co it&#39;s going to take a while to turn the corner but I do kind of like this one the cash flow is still going down revenues are going down margins are going down but on balance I think they can weather it until the cycle turn and it&#39;s a highly cyclical business uh but I think their balance sheet is okay uh abilities yeah it&#39;s not perfect but they should be fine um yeah that one&#39;s a pretty good one so I wouldn&#39;t you know pretty good meaning it&#39;s worthwhile to start to do a few weeks of work to determine if you&#39;re going to make a meaningful investment in it so uh good job on that neat okay on to the next [Music] Maryanne uh hi new listener this year and love the podcast that&#39;s Marian nap thank you Maran uh thank you for what you do for retail investors like me I&#39;m interested to hear your thoughts on square and block Maran well Marian I&#39;m super happy to do it for retail investors and to to keep this in perspective there are a lot of very wealthy business people that listen to this every week a a lot of very large family offices and institutions that listen to this every week uh and I love the retail investors who stick with this and uh lose the get-rich quick mindset and uh find a way to build durable wealth over time uh if they apply a more principled framework uh to that is repeatable over time it can help them go a long way [Music] um all right block look we own PayPal we think it&#39;s a much better quality business run by a better operator uh block to me is probably going to work as well but it&#39;s a lower quality business with uh less attractive management and um but on the on the mend as well so they probably have a better crypto play in uh block but that&#39;s not our belly Wick either in terms of expertise um so I&#39;m for me it&#39;s a pass but I I think it&#39;ll probably work um but um it&#39;s you know I I just think they&#39;ve never historically had a decent return on Capital block PayPal has always consistently had a solid return on Capital it&#39;s a higher-end business in PayPal over blocks so uh for me I think square is much more of a commodity than PayPal is um PayPal has Brand value data value all the other things that we&#39;ve covered in recent weeks so that that&#39;s where I would play but uh Square might work for a trade but it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s just not not for us but thank you so much for the great question and uh you&#39;ll be able to discern better and better over time as you listen over the years uh hello there no that&#39;s not that Drew joining the number of stocks of good valuations grateful for your thoughts on FMC at current valuation not correlated with China I like it I&#39;ve looked at it uh um I think it&#39;s fine it&#39;s an a play we&#39;ve covered it I think in some of the podcasts and I also said I liked it so yeah I I have no problem with that one um but do do material work before you invest any material money Drew okay rean no okay Calvin no and I get a lot of emails Nick [Music] G long time listen and followed you chy to play very grateful for it please shed some light on dren Miller&#39;s Bond short position look inflation really value opinion perspective look um dry Miller is an absolute Legend I would never bet against Dr and Miller I will say that I&#39;ll just say that I disagree with the view and we&#39;ll see how it plays out over the next 20 4 months moving along um Matt Matt sent me a very nice note Matt I replied for that I don&#39;t know if you got my reply but I really appreciate that amazing note um very very grateful for that uh Tom could you please look at wns Holdings this is from rajash sub r manum okay I feel like we looked at this but let&#39;s take another look at it wns business Process Management provides data voice and analytical transformation uh manufact shipping Logistics okay so this is a compl complicated business it&#39;s based in India um looks like they&#39;re into a hundred different things look the financials look perfect on this India is a slight red flag for me uh there were a lot of frauds with some of the Outsourcing companies and over the years this looks like amazing perfect numbers so on a numbers basis I love everything about it but I really have to dig in and understand every aspect of their business and what&#39;s the competitive Moe and get real confidence in the numbers but this might be a cheaper way to play an overvalued Market in China uh so I think that&#39;s a good find I think you have to do a lot of work really dig into Management&#39;s backgrounds uh and whether they had success in in creating value for shareholders or if they were just promoters um and uh if you can get comfortable in the Integrity of management uh you probably have a decent business then you got to get comfort in the durability of their MO and what&#39;s going to keep competitors at Bay and if you can get confidence in those couple of things which is reflected in their numbers I think you might have something good here so that was a nice find Rees and uh let&#39;s see Stephen Kim longtime listener and fan of the podcast great to see the Intel investment working out as you&#39;ve laid out throughout the year what do you thoughts on asml um yeah it&#39;s had a small correction look asml is a great business with very little competition uh I don&#39;t think it&#39;s coming enough i&#39; I&#39;d take a hard look at it at 500 400 but um I don&#39;t know if it&#39;ll ever get there so it&#39;s just not cheap enough for me to make a double over two or three years so for that reason just a pass for now but I&#39;ll keep an eye on that one and nice find um Steve rampton who does the incredible videos you see every day uh sent in last week Estee louder and we we did respond to that one we like that one at these levels it can go lower before it goes higher but this is adorable brand for a hundred years that um has a lot of competition but it&#39;s basically hurting because of China and China&#39;s coming back so this is basically you know it&#39;s like buying another Baba basically and uh Baba&#39;s ready to roll so I I like EST louder uh they just put the new CEO people aren&#39;t happy because it was an Insider but it&#39;s a guy who knows the business backwards and forwards and he knows how to run the business when uh China recovers which it&#39;s starting to now and maybe accelerate by what happens over the next week and um It&#39;s a Brand that&#39;s uh you know they&#39;ve got Mac they&#39;ve got so much much other stuff so if you believe in China you want to be in this if you don&#39;t believe in China you don&#39;t want to be in it uh the risk at these levels which I&#39;m willing to certainly take is that uh the new CEO comes in and does a massive kitchen SN quarter in his first quarter to clear the deck so he takes a huge loss uh before doing it but I think people are kind of expecting that so it might already be priced into the stock uh but certainly could go a little bit lower before it starts to recover and this is an early early early days of recovery but with this kind of quality of a franchise if China turns this thing&#39;s going to rip fast so uh I think you got a good one here Stephen and um uh thanks for sending it in and thanks for all the amazing work you do on the videos um as well so with that said we&#39;ll be back next week same time same place hope to meet a couple of you in Dallas in the meantime make it a great one bye for now [Music] oh [Music] [Music] [Music] n okay
