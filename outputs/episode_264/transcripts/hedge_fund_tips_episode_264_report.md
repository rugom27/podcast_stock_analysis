## Technical Takeaways
The put call ratio got up it actually got up spiked that day at 130 which is Extreme there was so much fear and then same thing in 2016 before Trump got elected it spiked up to 140 and then same thing in 2016 even with Biden it spiked up to 120 right before the election and then what did you see a collapse in in vix and a rally in S&P collapse in vix rally in S&P collapse in vix rally in S&P why do you get that all at once is because you catch the whole Market off sides and there's no way the the sellers of that premium are letting these people get get paid when everyone crowded in to pay the most expensive price at the exact wrong time for insurance they got they're they got smoked okay so happens every time and so this wasn't Tom does it's not a crystal ball that I look into it's just seeing this these patterns over and over again and recognizing them and being able to benefit from them so versus buying puts you're buying stocks and then you got the enormous rally the next day and and that's a good thing not a bad thing you didn't have to predict the election to know that put premium was too high
