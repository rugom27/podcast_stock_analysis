[00:03:15] listeners clients Etc uh in person which
[00:03:18] would be fun so with that said uh let's
[00:03:22] get to the markets overview we'll do the
[00:03:23] media and then we're going to get down
[00:03:26] to a lot of data a lot of earnings uh
[00:03:29] this is a catchup I mean I know last
[00:03:30] week wasn't short but it was shorter
[00:03:32] than normal so first I want to thank
[00:03:35] Neil Cavuto and jenet D tomases for
[00:03:38] having me on Fox Business Cavuto Coast
[00:03:41] to Coast this week and we're going to
[00:03:44] listen in now other Thomas I want to go
[00:03:45] to is Thomas Hayes the chairman of
[00:03:46] managing member of great Hill Capital
[00:03:48] Thomas you heard the other Thomas and
[00:03:50] what he was saying about the environment
[00:03:52] for this we don't need a cut right now
[00:03:54] but the markets certainly are
[00:03:55] anticipating not necessarily from
[00:03:57] today's meeting uh but Alan ler of
[00:03:58] course the provides the see they made a
[00:04:00] credible argument for doing that but but
[00:04:03] that aside um Market rates are very low
[00:04:06] it's just looking at a 10e in and out of
[00:04:09] 4.09% maybe you don't need to do
[00:04:11] anything maybe the markets are doing the
[00:04:13] the heavy lifting for the FED what do
[00:04:15] you
[00:04:15] think well in anticipation of the cut
[00:04:18] you do have the FED funds rate
[00:04:23] over so the 10e yield is compressing and
[00:04:27] in the event that they walked back the
[00:04:30] cuts you would see that 10year yield
[00:04:32] shoot right back up the markets would be
[00:04:34] down so it's a little bit of uh setting
[00:04:38] I'm sorry but would that apply if they
[00:04:39] do nothing in other words if they if
[00:04:41] they do nothing I guess the big issue
[00:04:43] today is what they signal or Jerome pal
[00:04:46] signals when he talks to reporters and
[00:04:48] if he sets the stage for September cut
[00:04:51] how do the markets deal with
[00:04:54] that yeah I think that's baked into the
[00:04:56] markets right now I think the surprise
[00:04:57] would be if he said maybe September is
[00:05:00] not on the table the markets would react
[00:05:02] but you're seeing it look the rotation
[00:05:04] has begun July was a turning point we
[00:05:06] saw the dramatic rotation in
[00:05:09] anticipation of one cut in September and
[00:05:11] possibly another in December so the
[00:05:14] market likes that the the market is
[00:05:16] acting accordingly but what's
[00:05:17] interesting is Tech and communication
[00:05:19] Services up to this point for the month
[00:05:21] of July were negative while Banks were
[00:05:24] up 16% real estate was up 7% utilities
[00:05:27] was up 5% so this is kind of baked into
[00:05:30] the market at
[00:05:31] present um let's talk technology real
[00:05:33] quickly Thomas I mean what what what the
[00:05:36] market taketh away give it back with a
[00:05:38] vengeance and Microsoft is getting the
[00:05:40] credit for this even though its numbers
[00:05:42] uh failed to impress especially its
[00:05:44] Cloud database and business and all the
[00:05:47] rest but the fact of the matter was it
[00:05:49] did indicate it's spending a heck of a
[00:05:50] lot of money on artificial intelligence
[00:05:53] and every facet that was deemed along
[00:05:56] with the AMD news as a sign that you
[00:05:58] know uh this this AI spending is still
[00:06:02] strong and it's lifting all the chip
[00:06:03] makers so how do you interpret that how
[00:06:06] how long live do you see this play it
[00:06:09] out for
[00:06:10] me yeah well Neil we have an AI arms
[00:06:13] race between Microsoft Google and Amazon
[00:06:17] and the AI arms dealers are the
[00:06:19] short-term winners Nvidia uh Intel and
[00:06:23] AMD but I think that's going to change
[00:06:25] so like you said Microsoft's capex was
[00:06:28] up 7
[00:06:30] 7.6% while their revenues were only up
[00:06:32] 15% seoa wrote an article about a month
[00:06:35] ago called the $600 billion question and
[00:06:38] basically what they said was uh given
[00:06:40] the amount of capex that these companies
[00:06:42] are spending on GPU chips they would
[00:06:44] need another 600 billion and we're back
[00:06:49] then I want to thank Melanie schaer of
[00:06:53] ceo.ca it's out of Toronto for doing a
[00:06:57] long form interview with me that gives
[00:06:59] you some context as to what's happening
[00:07:01] under the surface so we'll listen in
[00:07:04] [Music]
[00:07:15] now I'm excited to be joined today by
[00:07:17] Thomas Hayes chairman and managing
[00:07:19] member great Hill Capital how are you
[00:07:20] doing today Tom doing great Mel thanks
[00:07:22] for having me so we're talking during a
[00:07:25] huge week for the market the US Federal
[00:07:27] Reserve is meeting as we speak into
[00:07:29] tomorrow the central bank will announce
[00:07:31] its decision on interest rates we also
[00:07:33] have four companies within the
[00:07:34] Magnificent Seven reporting earnings
[00:07:36] we'll get into the rotation that you've
[00:07:38] been calling for for a long time in a
[00:07:40] minute but what should investors expect
[00:07:42] to see from these earnings and the
[00:07:43] guidance that's issued and will the FED
[00:07:45] cut rates
[00:07:47] tomorrow the million dooll question will
[00:07:50] the FED Cut Rate tomorrow well look I
[00:07:52] think just as important as the fed's
[00:07:54] decision is more importantly is actually
[00:07:57] the bank of Japan because we've had this
[00:07:59] theme Mel where Bank of Japan has been
[00:08:03] the global liquidity provider with
[00:08:05] unlimited quantitative easing not only
[00:08:08] buying jgbs uh and us treasuries but
[00:08:11] actually buying domestic and Global
[00:08:13] equities well that that is uh gig is up
[00:08:16] and they are now in a tightening period
[00:08:20] they' wanted inflation for many years
[00:08:21] they now have it and uh all bets are on
[00:08:25] that they could be raising rates almost
[00:08:27] as we speak I know their meeting is
[00:08:29] happening and and we'll know in the next
[00:08:30] 24 hours so as they start to withdraw
[00:08:33] that liquidity from Global markets the
[00:08:36] pressure is on the fed and the ECB to
[00:08:39] now step in and uh be a global provider
[00:08:43] of liquidity I know there are some
[00:08:45] Traders and investors who think tomorrow
[00:08:49] uh and this week may be a live meeting
[00:08:51] for the fed the odds don't favorite uh
[00:08:54] chair Powell other than his autopilot
[00:08:57] debacle in December of 2018
[00:09:00] uh prefers not to shock the market or
[00:09:02] surprise the market so my sense is uh
[00:09:05] it's it's going to be February where uh
[00:09:07] excuse me in September where consensus
[00:09:10] current currently is that the first cut
[00:09:12] will be in September uh based on you
[00:09:15] know Dudley coming out and a couple of
[00:09:17] others and some of the weakness that
[00:09:19] we're seeing in the employment stats it
[00:09:22] wouldn't be
[00:09:24] unjustified to cut tomorrow but I think
[00:09:27] they have not done a good job of
[00:09:29] preparing the market if that was their
[00:09:31] intention and therefore we think
[00:09:33] September is going to be the base case
[00:09:35] for the first cut and December the
[00:09:37] second cut and what about for the big
[00:09:39] Tech earnings coming out this week yeah
[00:09:41] you know the the big thing here seoa put
[00:09:44] out a great uh white paper a few weeks
[00:09:47] ago called the $600 billion do question
[00:09:50] and what they basically said was all the
[00:09:53] cap backs that we're seeing on AI chips
[00:09:55] uh and
[00:09:57] semiconductors uh is is fine except for
[00:10:00] the fact that it would require $600
[00:10:02] billion of new Revenue to justify the
[00:10:05] cost and they break down SAS margins and
[00:10:08] uh Etc and what we saw with alphabet was
[00:10:12] a concerning Trend where the capex was
[00:10:16] was very high and the revenues were not
[00:10:18] yet nearly supportive to justify that
[00:10:21] capex and you've effectively had an arms
[00:10:24] race with all of big big Tech trying to
[00:10:26] hoard as many high-end chips as they
[00:10:28] possibly could as quickly as they could
[00:10:30] so that their competition didn't have it
[00:10:32] but there the revenues that support that
[00:10:35] level of spend are nowhere to be found
[00:10:37] so there's a there's a fear about
[00:10:40] margins there's a fear about how long
[00:10:43] will it take if ever to fill that $600
[00:10:46] billion Revenue hole commencer it with
[00:10:48] the capex bend that we've seen uh and
[00:10:51] the front loading of the the chip
[00:10:53] hoarding so you know I think that big
[00:10:58] Tech and magn 7 have come in a
[00:11:01] reasonable amount but it wouldn't
[00:11:05] surprise me look I would say this it
[00:11:08] would surprise me if this was another
[00:11:10] 2000 Tech wre I don't see that coming
[00:11:13] because these are huge free cash flow
[00:11:16] generators which was not the case in
[00:11:18] 2000 so I wouldn't compare it to that uh
[00:11:21] but I think prospectively certainly for
[00:11:24] the next 9 to 18 months we should see a
[00:11:28] scenario
[00:11:29] where irrespective of tomorrow's
[00:11:32] earnings or or the day after's earnings
[00:11:34] where the mag magnificent 7 as a basket
[00:11:38] underperforms the
[00:11:41] unmagnify I.E the second half of the
[00:11:43] year we should see more subdued General
[00:11:46] indices because of the weights of
[00:11:48] magnificent 7 within the market cap
[00:11:50] weight indices and uh huge monstrous
[00:11:54] opportunities under the surface for the
[00:11:56] Left Behind stocks I mean you saw a
[00:11:58] couple today that we've talked a lot
[00:11:59] about on our podcast and and in public
[00:12:02] uh TV appearances you know PayPal is up
[00:12:05] uh seven eight percent today on beating
[00:12:07] earnings Stanley Black and Decker talk
[00:12:09] about old world uh is up seven or eight%
[00:12:12] on beating earnings so there's a lot of
[00:12:14] great stuff happening under the surface
[00:12:16] that gets no headlines while everyone's
[00:12:18] overcrowded into the mag 7 that the air
[00:12:22] is leaking out of that balloon I don't I
[00:12:24] wouldn't say it's going to pop or
[00:12:26] anything like that I would just say it's
[00:12:28] it's going to
[00:12:30] be much more subdued for the near term
[00:12:33] yeah so you've been calling for a
[00:12:34] rotation out of the mag s and big Tech
[00:12:36] into small caps even though as you said
[00:12:38] there's been a lot of skepticism around
[00:12:40] that idea now we see that shift appears
[00:12:42] to have started can you walk us through
[00:12:44] your thesis and what you see happening
[00:12:46] into the end of the year and even into
[00:12:48] next year I know on your podcast you
[00:12:50] referred to 2025 as the year of the
[00:12:52] small caps yeah yeah I think well I I
[00:12:55] think we've started in 2024 and and
[00:12:58] we'll see more of that in in the second
[00:13:00] half of 2024 and that should continue
[00:13:02] into 2025 as a matter of fact
[00:13:04] historically since World War II small
[00:13:07] caps outperform large caps by about
[00:13:10] 11% in the first 12 months after the
[00:13:13] first cut so if if our base case is
[00:13:17] correct in September is the first cut
[00:13:19] that would imply a meaningful
[00:13:21] outperformance uh again for you know
[00:13:23] another 14 16 18 months the first part
[00:13:27] of that easing cycle and and I think
[00:13:29] that's going to be positive but you know
[00:13:30] a lot of people are skeptical that you
[00:13:32] know there have been several fake outs
[00:13:34] Etc and I think what's different this
[00:13:36] time is the earnings composition has
[00:13:40] dramatically changed so we started the
[00:13:43] year with enormous earnings growth for
[00:13:46] the Magnificent Seven with the first
[00:13:48] quarter alone they had 50% earnings
[00:13:51] growth -0 and the
[00:13:54] unmagnify had negative 1% so it's it's
[00:13:57] no wonder that they dramatically uh
[00:13:59] underperformed the 493 and the mag 7
[00:14:02] dramatically outperformed the earnings
[00:14:04] growth was there well that composition
[00:14:06] is changing it's expected by the fourth
[00:14:09] quarter that the
[00:14:11] unmagnify will have 19% earnings growth
[00:14:14] and the Magnificent 7 will have 177%
[00:14:17] earnings growth which is why I say
[00:14:18] they'll be fine they're just in our view
[00:14:21] going to
[00:14:22] underperform because they're
[00:14:24] decelerating in earnings growth versus
[00:14:26] the rest of the market is accelerating
[00:14:28] and then as far as supporting the
[00:14:30] underlying thesis in small caps in
[00:14:33] addition to cyclicals and and the
[00:14:35] unmagnify 493 the earnings growth this
[00:14:38] year is about 4% uh and next year it's
[00:14:41] expected to be 177% whereas large caps
[00:14:45] are going to be 14% earnings growth next
[00:14:47] year and their 12% this year so uh it's
[00:14:50] not a hope or a wish uh the only thing
[00:14:53] that could change that thesis would be a
[00:14:55] dramatic change in earnings expectations
[00:14:57] for small caps versus large caps caps
[00:14:59] and so far we're not seeing that so far
[00:15:01] it's actually right on schedule and uh
[00:15:04] and we're going to see more of that I I
[00:15:06] think in the last few days or so where
[00:15:09] you saw little hiccup when kamla was
[00:15:11] announced as the candidate you saw teex
[00:15:14] start to take off and uh the
[00:15:17] unmagnify uh take a little rest but I
[00:15:20] think that was also a function of they
[00:15:22] mooved so far so fast I think it was
[00:15:24] something like 133% in a week and a half
[00:15:27] small caps as a basket moved it was just
[00:15:29] an excuse to rest so irrespective of the
[00:15:32] president uh who's elected Etc I think
[00:15:35] this this trend is going to persist
[00:15:37] because the composition and the cost of
[00:15:40] capital cycle supports it well the
[00:15:43] Russell 2000 is up about 11% since the
[00:15:46] second quarter ended now how should
[00:15:48] investors be positioning themselves for
[00:15:50] a longer term shift and what data should
[00:15:52] they be paying particular attention
[00:15:55] to yeah I think a couple of things are
[00:15:58] are going going to take place number one
[00:16:00] the UNM magnificent 493 so there will be
[00:16:02] large caps that do extremely well that
[00:16:04] have lagged the non non magnificent 7
[00:16:08] then you've got anything interest rate
[00:16:10] sensitive so dividend Growers Stanley
[00:16:13] Black and& Decker is a great example of
[00:16:14] that um cyclicals REITs are another one
[00:16:19] that have been left for dead they're the
[00:16:20] most under owned since
[00:16:23] 2009 everyone's calling for commercial
[00:16:25] real estate uh apocalypse we think there
[00:16:28] there is some truth to that but it's Mo
[00:16:31] mostly going to be in the B and C
[00:16:34] Properties this is analogous analogous
[00:16:36] to the mall uh debacle you know four or
[00:16:40] five years ago where the a malls wound
[00:16:43] up doing better you know the the Simon
[00:16:45] properties of the world that have
[00:16:46] Lululemon and Apple Stores and all the
[00:16:48] things that people want to go to and
[00:16:50] then the BNC malls that were anchored by
[00:16:53] JC Penney and Sears uh had been a train
[00:16:56] wreck I I think this it will be similar
[00:16:58] for commercial office uh I think there's
[00:17:00] a little bit of froth in the multifam uh
[00:17:05] in in certain areas in the country we'll
[00:17:07] see some of that but I think it'll be a
[00:17:09] slow motion unwind and lenders
[00:17:13] incentivized to extend and pretend so it
[00:17:16] won't be an acute abrupt type of uh pop
[00:17:19] it will be more of a slow leakage uh
[00:17:22] that can be contained and the rest of
[00:17:24] the market can pick up the slack the
[00:17:26] other thing that's happening in the same
[00:17:28] at the same time Mel that few people are
[00:17:30] focused on is we have been in a dramatic
[00:17:34] recession for the last two years it's
[00:17:37] just been contained well it started with
[00:17:39] the two quarters of negative GDP growth
[00:17:42] uh and and uh in 2002 first quarter
[00:17:46] second quarter uh and it was supported
[00:17:49] by a massive manufacturing slowdown the
[00:17:53] destocking cycle that has now bottomed
[00:17:56] and is starting to turn up we're
[00:17:57] starting to see more positive signs
[00:18:00] slowly green shoots where manufacturing
[00:18:02] is coming back and we're certainly
[00:18:04] seeing very green Shoots for the
[00:18:07] destocking cycle being in the rear view
[00:18:09] mirror and the restocking cycle just
[00:18:12] starting and that's not the time that
[00:18:15] you hit tops in markets or ends of
[00:18:17] Cycles that's more the time when you hit
[00:18:18] second legs uh and refreshes a cycle and
[00:18:21] that's what we're starting to see right
[00:18:23] now as evidenced in uh Stanley Black and
[00:18:26] Decker is a great example of that this
[00:18:27] morning they they spent eight quarters
[00:18:29] destocking and now they're restocking
[00:18:31] their free cash flows going through the
[00:18:32] roof uh they paid down a bunch of debt
[00:18:34] they've taken the costs out and we're
[00:18:36] seeing that among all many of the the
[00:18:40] unmagnify can you give us a rundown of
[00:18:42] three stocks that you're bullish on into
[00:18:44] the end of the year yeah I can I can do
[00:18:46] that for sure I I we love PayPal we've
[00:18:48] lik that for a while it's been dead
[00:18:50] money for a number of months uh but I
[00:18:52] think today was the Breakthrough quarter
[00:18:54] uh we saw earn we saw the revenues were
[00:18:56] up 8% their earnings were up 177% their
[00:18:59] payment volume was up 11% their free
[00:19:02] cash flow for the quarter was 1.4
[00:19:05] billion I mean how many turnaround quote
[00:19:07] unquote turnaround situations do you see
[00:19:10] that they're generating six6 billion
[00:19:12] dollars of cash per year and you can't
[00:19:14] give the stock away so uh uh and their
[00:19:17] margins are coming back so they they not
[00:19:19] only took guidance up they said by the
[00:19:22] way we're not going to do five billion
[00:19:23] of free cash flow we're going to do six
[00:19:25] billion of free cash flow oh and by the
[00:19:28] way uh remember how we said we're going
[00:19:29] to buy back $5 billion worth of stock
[00:19:32] this year yeah we changed our mind we're
[00:19:33] going to buy back $ billion worth of
[00:19:36] stock this year so Alex Chris who came
[00:19:39] from into it he ran the small business
[00:19:42] division which was responsible for 50%
[00:19:45] of the revenues of a of a stock that
[00:19:47] went up you know 20s something times
[00:19:49] during his tenure 20x plus uh has taken
[00:19:52] the Reigns of PayPal and he laid out his
[00:19:56] plan earlier this year it fell flat but
[00:19:59] he's executing and we saw that and we're
[00:20:01] seeing the the movement in the stock
[00:20:02] price today and we believe it's just the
[00:20:04] beginning of many good things to come uh
[00:20:06] on PayPal and then uh Stanley Black and
[00:20:09] Decker as I said they sold a non-core
[00:20:11] business paid down $1.2 billion of debt
[00:20:14] their their cost reduction plan to cut
[00:20:17] $2 billion doll of costs by the end of
[00:20:20] 2025 is almost 75% done they've taken
[00:20:24] nearly $1.5 billion of cost out of the
[00:20:27] business the business is inflection they
[00:20:29] inflecting they have uh DeWalt they have
[00:20:33] Craftsman they have Stanley they have
[00:20:35] black and& Decker so if you believe in
[00:20:37] construction and you believe in
[00:20:39] manufacturing and you believe there's
[00:20:41] going to be an increased demand for
[00:20:42] tools and you believe in the housing
[00:20:44] shortage and you believe that uh that
[00:20:47] the Millennials are going to continue
[00:20:50] housing formation for the next five
[00:20:51] years you want to own Stanley Black and&
[00:20:54] Decker or at least we own it you should
[00:20:55] do whatever you want to do uh opinion
[00:20:58] not advice
[00:20:59] then you know we like you know as you
[00:21:01] can tell we like durable businesses that
[00:21:03] are temporarily out of favor we like
[00:21:05] Disney okay you can't give Disney stock
[00:21:07] away they just had their greatest box
[00:21:09] office of a R-rated movie in history uh
[00:21:13] with Deadpool and Wolverine I I didn't
[00:21:15] get a chance to see it but uh I guess
[00:21:18] I'll have to now as an owner of the
[00:21:19] business and uh and we look at the sum
[00:21:22] of the parts and what's what's
[00:21:23] fascinating about Disney there's so much
[00:21:25] pessimism and noise around Disney but
[00:21:29] if you do the sum of the parts the parks
[00:21:32] and the experiences and the consumer
[00:21:34] products do about 10 billion of eida
[00:21:37] it's probably a little bit more now so
[00:21:39] that's worth about $80 a share okay as
[00:21:42] of a couple of days ago the stock was
[00:21:43] trading around $9 a share it's bumped up
[00:21:46] a little bit since the
[00:21:47] weekend still incredibly cheap what that
[00:21:50] means is effectively the market is
[00:21:52] assigning zero value to Disney plus
[00:21:57] which has 100
[00:21:59] 53 million subscriptions uh ESPN which
[00:22:03] is the number one sports property in the
[00:22:06] world and currently gaining share not
[00:22:09] losing share you've got Hulu you've got
[00:22:12] the T TV networks and you have the movie
[00:22:16] theatrical releases like we saw this
[00:22:18] weekend and we saw with inside out to
[00:22:20] which was a huge success uh that's
[00:22:23] that's going to be another multi-billion
[00:22:24] dollar Blockbuster and the market is
[00:22:26] currently assigning for all of those
[00:22:28] those pieces of the business mail you're
[00:22:30] the market is assigning zero do of value
[00:22:34] those business on a normalized run rate
[00:22:36] are going to do 15 billion of ebit We
[00:22:38] Believe which implies that the stock
[00:22:41] could over the next three to five years
[00:22:43] in our in our opinion could uh be $180
[00:22:46] to $200 stock so basically a double uh
[00:22:49] over a few years as the market starts to
[00:22:51] recognize that and that's not like wish
[00:22:53] or hope if you look at Netflix it's got
[00:22:56] 270 some odd million uh users and they
[00:22:59] get about a quarter of a billion dollars
[00:23:02] worth of value attributed to to the
[00:23:05] value of those uh subscribers so even if
[00:23:09] you say well Disney are only worth half
[00:23:11] as much there's a hundred some odd
[00:23:13] billion dollars that's not not yet
[00:23:14] priced into the stock we think there's
[00:23:16] tremendous opportunity and then finally
[00:23:18] is a boring business called gxo
[00:23:20] Logistics this is one of Brad Jacobs
[00:23:23] companies and Brad Jacobs has the
[00:23:25] mightest touch he's done uh if you had
[00:23:27] invested a million
[00:23:28] with him when he he got involved with
[00:23:31] United Rentals you would have made 47
[00:23:33] times your money over a number of years
[00:23:36] if you had gotten involved with xbo
[00:23:38] Logistics in 2010 when he got involved
[00:23:40] you would have made 31 times your money
[00:23:42] so a million becomes 31 million and gxo
[00:23:45] Logistics was spun out of xbo they do
[00:23:48] Outsource Logistics supply chain uh
[00:23:50] reverse Logistics uh order fulfillment
[00:23:53] Etc and uh they have guided that they're
[00:23:56] going to nearly double A adjusted iida
[00:23:59] by
[00:24:00] 2027 which implies you could get nearly
[00:24:03] a double in the stock except for the
[00:24:04] fact that when your growth rate
[00:24:07] accelerates as it will with these uh
[00:24:10] assimilations of some recent
[00:24:11] acquisitions that they've done not only
[00:24:13] do you get the the doubling in terms of
[00:24:16] uh stock price you get some multiple
[00:24:18] expansion as they start growing and
[00:24:20] continue to grow Top Line and bottom
[00:24:22] line by double digits the market will
[00:24:23] pay a premium for growth and that's why
[00:24:26] we think this this one as well could be
[00:24:28] double double plus over the next handful
[00:24:30] of years uh and a huge track record of
[00:24:33] success and a huge total addressable
[00:24:35] Market of 430 billion which they've only
[00:24:38] got about 5% they're the second largest
[00:24:40] player basically a duopoly with DHL and
[00:24:43] a fragmented business and uh and huge
[00:24:46] huge open space for them to
[00:24:48] grow and lastly Tom um just because
[00:24:50] we're running out of time and I know
[00:24:52] this isn't your favorite thing to talk
[00:24:53] about but as the US election cycle
[00:24:56] continues to heat up can you tell us
[00:24:57] what the stock market wants to see in
[00:24:59] terms of who ends up in the White House
[00:25:01] and which party or parties take control
[00:25:03] of the house and the
[00:25:05] Senate yeah that's a fair question look
[00:25:07] I I think at the end of the day uh
[00:25:10] empirically speaking what's worked
[00:25:12] historically is when no party controls
[00:25:16] all three branches so the worst case
[00:25:18] scenario would be if you have either uh
[00:25:21] all Democratic executive Senate and
[00:25:25] House or an all Republican executive
[00:25:28] Senate and House that's bad for the
[00:25:30] stock market bad meaning it will perform
[00:25:32] less well than when you have a situation
[00:25:34] of gridlock where one party controls at
[00:25:37] least one of those three branches and
[00:25:39] that's effectively what we want to see
[00:25:41] whether you're on the right side of of
[00:25:43] of the spectrum or the left side what
[00:25:45] you should be hopeful for is that your
[00:25:47] party does not win all three branches if
[00:25:49] you own stocks because what works best
[00:25:52] is gridlock the market likes when
[00:25:54] politicians are limited in their ability
[00:25:56] to get stuff done because the more they
[00:25:58] do the worse it tends to get so we'll
[00:26:01] leave it at that and uh and let's hope
[00:26:04] for gridlock and and whomever uh you
[00:26:07] hope uh gains the executive branch uh
[00:26:10] just just be hopeful that uh they're
[00:26:12] checked in Congress it's definitely
[00:26:15] going to be interesting there's lots to
[00:26:16] watch over the uh days and weeks ahead
[00:26:19] yeah again Thomas Hayes chairman and
[00:26:21] managing member great Hill Capital
[00:26:23] thanks again for joining us Tom thanks m
[00:26:27] [Music]
[00:26:35] [Applause]
[00:26:38] and we're back and then finally I want
[00:26:41] to thank uh Sean calebs and Ryan
[00:26:45] Gallagher uh for having me on cgtn
[00:26:48] America last night to talk about the
[00:26:49] fed's uh developments we'll listen in
[00:26:52] now well what the FED does or doesn't do
[00:26:54] is always big news for talk more about
[00:26:56] this latest decision on interest rates
[00:26:58] and what it's going to mean for the US
[00:27:00] economy moving forward let's bring in
[00:27:01] Thomas Hayes Thomas is of course the
[00:27:03] founder and chairman and managing member
[00:27:05] of great Hill Capital LLC uh a long
[00:27:09] short Equity manager based in New York
[00:27:11] City Thomas always a pleasure great to
[00:27:12] have you back thanks for having me Sean
[00:27:15] okay let's dissect what Jerome pal had
[00:27:18] to say uh really no surprise as our John
[00:27:20] ter just told us that there wasn't a
[00:27:22] drop in interest rates today but your
[00:27:24] thoughts on the language that he used
[00:27:26] about a potential cut in September
[00:27:28] saying it will be on the table so do
[00:27:31] markets build in that they're expecting
[00:27:34] this cut and then if it does or doesn't
[00:27:36] happen what are we looking for the next
[00:27:38] eight weeks well Sean I think the market
[00:27:41] is already built it in uh fed funds
[00:27:43] Futures had been pricing nearly 100%
[00:27:46] chance of the first cut in September and
[00:27:49] what we saw in the month of July was
[00:27:52] that the great rotation in anticipation
[00:27:54] of that began in Earnest as a matter of
[00:27:57] fact if you look at
[00:27:59] as of this morning you had Tech and
[00:28:01] Communications services for the month of
[00:28:03] July were nearly flat were a little bit
[00:28:05] negative might have closed barely
[00:28:07] positive but Banks were up 16% on the
[00:28:10] month real estate was up 6.9% utilities
[00:28:13] was up 5% uh equal weighted uh S&P was
[00:28:17] up 5% whereas the cap weighted the
[00:28:20] normal S&P 500 was only up about 1% uh
[00:28:23] maybe a little bit more at the close and
[00:28:25] then small caps were up 10 10% so the
[00:28:29] market has already started to get ahead
[00:28:31] of this and the language as you stated
[00:28:33] Sean did in fact change to be more
[00:28:36] predictive that he is moving ahead as a
[00:28:38] matter of fact there were a few fed
[00:28:40] members he he alluded to that wanted to
[00:28:42] go in July wow okay so to talk more
[00:28:45] about what happened what areas of the
[00:28:48] economy is the US winning uh the fight
[00:28:51] against inflation in because that
[00:28:53] obviously is going to be first second
[00:28:55] third fourth fifth on the list uh
[00:28:58] leading them to make that decision one
[00:28:59] way or the other well we're seeing
[00:29:02] disinflation so we saw McDonald's for
[00:29:05] example had uh sales down 1% the big two
[00:29:09] things that have been holding up
[00:29:11] inflation were auto insurance and auto
[00:29:14] prices which have started to come down
[00:29:16] and owners equivalent rent which has
[00:29:18] been on a lagged basis which has also
[00:29:20] started to show some signs of weakness
[00:29:23] uh wages grew at just
[00:29:25] 0.8% in the second quarter so that was
[00:29:28] the softest since 2020 so everything is
[00:29:31] showing signs of disinflation but he did
[00:29:34] emphasize the Dual mandate and he
[00:29:37] started to make the case again that he
[00:29:40] was focusing just as much on inflation
[00:29:44] as now he is focused on employment he
[00:29:46] doesn't want to see material cracks in
[00:29:49] or weakening in the labor market which
[00:29:51] he's focused on like a hawk which uh you
[00:29:54] know just a month or two months ago he
[00:29:55] was only focused on inflation so this is
[00:29:58] a key turning point and he's seeing what
[00:30:00] the Market's seeing and that is he's
[00:30:02] going to have to move uh pretty quickly
[00:30:04] certainly in September as a matter of
[00:30:05] fact city was out today saying they
[00:30:07] start in September and they go all the
[00:30:09] way down to 3 and a half% which would be
[00:30:11] you know four or five consecutive Cuts
[00:30:13] in a row wow that'd be interesting now
[00:30:15] also uh we've heard the FED talk about
[00:30:18] it's important to not act too soon but
[00:30:20] you certainly don't want to act too late
[00:30:22] which is what you're talking about right
[00:30:24] now so if the economy is moving moving
[00:30:26] closer to its 2% inflation Target uh but
[00:30:30] there's still no question that consumers
[00:30:31] are feeling the bite you talked about
[00:30:33] some but people still grousing obviously
[00:30:35] about grocery prices housing uh talk
[00:30:37] about some of the problem areas and the
[00:30:39] frustration that people deal with day in
[00:30:41] and day out yeah there's no question I
[00:30:44] mean the real issue is incomes have
[00:30:47] actually risen slightly faster than
[00:30:49] overall inflation but it hurts people at
[00:30:52] the lower end because inflation is
[00:30:54] taxation without representation is
[00:30:56] basically what it comes down to it hits
[00:30:58] everyone and it hits people with the
[00:30:59] lowest discretionary income the hardest
[00:31:02] people that have to pay for regular
[00:31:03] Necessities food gasoline Etc on a daily
[00:31:06] basis rent on a daily basis uh and those
[00:31:09] prices unfortunately are not going back
[00:31:11] to pre-pandemic levels the best we can
[00:31:14] hope for is that they go down to
[00:31:17] increasing by 2% a year which is the
[00:31:19] goal but the FED has indicated they have
[00:31:21] to move before that Target is hit
[00:31:24] otherwise you run the risk of deflation
[00:31:27] and you know the key thing here is it's
[00:31:29] it's binary if they move too quickly
[00:31:31] they have a quick tool to bring it back
[00:31:33] in uh they can they can start hiking
[00:31:35] again but if they move too slowly and
[00:31:38] disinflation turns into deflation that
[00:31:40] can be extremely costly and hurt a lot
[00:31:43] of people you know the the saying is
[00:31:44] most people would rather pay an extra
[00:31:46] dollar for a gallon of milk and still
[00:31:47] have a job than have no job and he's
[00:31:49] focused on in on that right now and
[00:31:51] that's what's causing him to move in
[00:31:53] September yeah quickly those of with
[00:31:55] retirement accounts they've had a pretty
[00:31:57] good year Market's doing well uh now if
[00:31:59] there's a cut in September and another
[00:32:01] at the uh end of the year tell us what
[00:32:04] you believe is going to happen to the
[00:32:05] markets and if that doesn't happen
[00:32:08] what's going to happen to the
[00:32:10] markets well I think you shouldn't think
[00:32:13] about a retirement account in a
[00:32:14] quarterly basis you should think of it
[00:32:16] in years uh however it would be natural
[00:32:19] to see some short-term volatility ahead
[00:32:22] of the election which is you know late
[00:32:24] September early October and that just
[00:32:26] happens to line up with the FED meeting
[00:32:28] on the 17th 18 so coincident or causal
[00:32:31] it wouldn't surprise me if we see some
[00:32:33] continued strength uh over the next few
[00:32:36] weeks and then some some fall volatility
[00:32:39] uh along the lines of the election and
[00:32:41] or the FED meeting in September it could
[00:32:45] be and a lot of people are pointing to
[00:32:47] it could be a shortterm sell the news
[00:32:49] before a year-end uh rally that would
[00:32:52] not in fact surprise me at all but I but
[00:32:54] I wouldn't stay short too long because I
[00:32:57] think think after you get the certainty
[00:32:58] around the election regardless of who is
[00:33:00] elected you're going to see a rally into
[00:33:03] year end as the market absorbs all the
[00:33:05] new news so what we like to do over here
[00:33:07] at Great Hill capital is buy high
[00:33:09] quality companies when they're on sale
[00:33:10] and hold on to them for a while
[00:33:12] excellent advice excellent advice Thomas
[00:33:14] hay is always a pleasure thank you so
[00:33:16] much for your Insight thank you
[00:33:19] Sean and we're back and then finally uh
[00:33:22] both on the Euphoria on months like July
[00:33:27] uh with excitement and then days like
[00:33:30] today with uh a little volatility that
[00:33:33] we forgot exists normally in markets uh
[00:33:36] Ben Graham had to say it best Ben
[00:33:38] Graham's teacher said quote individuals
[00:33:41] who cannot Master their emotions are ill
[00:33:44] suited to profit from the investment
[00:33:46] process so on months where everything
[00:33:49] that you own is up like crazy uh it's
[00:33:52] easy to think you're a genius but you
[00:33:54] have to keep an eye on the underlying
[00:33:56] fundamentals of the business
[00:33:58] and then in days when things are down
[00:34:00] dramatically you say to yourself okay
[00:34:01] what's changed about xyz's ability to
[00:34:04] sell X and if nothing's changed then you
[00:34:07] ignore the short-term
[00:34:09] volatility moving on uh want to get
[00:34:13] through some of the data now Dudley
[00:34:16] citing growing recession risk urges fed
[00:34:19] to cut rates as soon as what would have
[00:34:20] been
[00:34:22] yesterday um Jeffrey gunak who runs
[00:34:25] double line a huge bond shop I think 80
[00:34:28] billion under management uh also said
[00:34:30] the FED should have cut yesterday and
[00:34:31] then when we saw the weak employment
[00:34:33] data this morning which kind of threw
[00:34:35] the market into a
[00:34:37] tizzy uh people started saying they
[00:34:39] should have Jeremy seagull was out
[00:34:42] saying 50 basis points is not off the
[00:34:44] table for September so they might have
[00:34:47] to play a little catchup I think they'll
[00:34:50] be going uh be okay going in September
[00:34:53] let's see the numbers tomorrow the good
[00:34:55] news is earnings are still holding up
[00:34:57] well which will buy them enough time but
[00:34:59] I think if they go much later than
[00:35:01] September they're going to get a hard
[00:35:03] landing and um he couldn't say it any
[00:35:06] more clearly which is you know to gun
[00:35:08] laak's point if you're going to say that
[00:35:10] you're going in September just go just
[00:35:12] go now like what's the difference of
[00:35:13] seven or eight weeks um the key thing
[00:35:16] that's happening under the surface that
[00:35:19] no one's really talking about in the US
[00:35:22] aggressively is that Japan has been a
[00:35:27] Global liquidity provider for 2 years
[00:35:30] while the rest of the world was
[00:35:31] tightening and now they've moved
[00:35:33] abruptly into being a liquidity
[00:35:37] extractor by tightening and starting to
[00:35:40] discontinue their quantitative easing
[00:35:44] and what is a seamless transition would
[00:35:46] be if the FED started easing at the same
[00:35:50] time that Japan was tightening but since
[00:35:53] there's a 6 we 8we window that that's
[00:35:58] not the case we could
[00:36:01] see uh issues with short-term liquidity
[00:36:05] and that will finally Force the fed's
[00:36:07] hand so uh this type
[00:36:10] of
[00:36:13] uh volatility should be expected you saw
[00:36:17] the Nik was down 3% overnight and then
[00:36:20] we opened up strong which made little
[00:36:23] sense um so let's just see my guess is
[00:36:28] you're going to see more fed liquidity
[00:36:33] provisioning in the repurchases of
[00:36:37] balance sheet rolloff so they'll
[00:36:39] probably ramp that up for the next 6
[00:36:41] weeks until they can finally get the cut
[00:36:44] in action uh and whether that will be
[00:36:47] enough or not time will tell but today
[00:36:50] the market was saying we're worried
[00:36:52] about liquidity particularly when you
[00:36:54] have the labor market
[00:36:57] headed towards what they call the S rule
[00:37:00] which means when the unemployment rate
[00:37:03] Rises at a particular Pace it tends to
[00:37:06] Signal a recession and we're getting
[00:37:08] close to that pace so it's got a lot of
[00:37:11] people worried I am less worried but
[00:37:15] watching it like a hawk and Powell
[00:37:18] seemed very nervous and very focused and
[00:37:20] very reading from a script yesterday uh
[00:37:24] that he's fully aware and emphasized the
[00:37:26] two-sided risk as as we covered with
[00:37:29] Sean now on the flip
[00:37:31] side us business activity expands by the
[00:37:34] most in more than 2 years so there's
[00:37:36] runway
[00:37:39] for I think you know six to eight weeks
[00:37:43] to get that cut in and then kind of
[00:37:44] catch catch a soft Landing here retail
[00:37:47] inventories are starting to go up dstock
[00:37:48] to restock cycle uh which we've been
[00:37:51] talking about UK manufacturing
[00:37:53] recovering that's good for
[00:37:56] gxo uh UK business activity picks up
[00:37:59] after pre-election low that's good US
[00:38:02] dollar Japanese Yen Japanese yen is
[00:38:04] collapsing as we anticipated it started
[00:38:06] in July it's absolutely rolling over big
[00:38:10] time and that's going to be good in time
[00:38:13] for China it's you know it's taking
[00:38:16] forever but it's uh all of the pieces of
[00:38:19] the script that we needed to play out
[00:38:21] are playing out have we gotten a bazooka
[00:38:23] no but we've gotten a t ton of uh small
[00:38:26] shotgun rounds that added together could
[00:38:28] be the equivalent of a cannon with a
[00:38:30] time lag and then we're getting the 180
[00:38:32] million of new buyers so I love seeing
[00:38:34] this Yen weekend uh I'm sorry strength
[00:38:37] in relative to the US dollar that was
[00:38:39] key to get the hot money flows that came
[00:38:41] from China to Japan and India everyone
[00:38:44] thought those were fundamentally based
[00:38:46] we
[00:38:47] disagree um uh and as the Yen
[00:38:51] strengthens we'll see if those hot money
[00:38:53] flows flow back into China when it
[00:38:56] happens it happens all at once we got a
[00:38:58] taste of that with cyclicals and small
[00:39:00] caps and banks in the month of July they
[00:39:03] all just went up all at the same time as
[00:39:05] we had been calling for in the sea
[00:39:08] change uh public appearances that we had
[00:39:10] on Fox in late June and early July and
[00:39:12] sure enough it came and it came very
[00:39:14] very quickly uh you're seeing micro cap
[00:39:17] even start to outperform the S&P
[00:39:19] 500 and then some key quotes
[00:39:24] um where you're seeing night Swift this
[00:39:26] is from earnings this week night Swift
[00:39:29] Transportation uh the early signs of
[00:39:32] Market setting up to change so they the
[00:39:34] transports have been smoked and now uh
[00:39:37] they're starting to see some light at
[00:39:38] the end of the tunnel the other thing
[00:39:40] that was interesting there were two
[00:39:42] semiconductor companies I'm trying to
[00:39:44] remember if it was Qualcomm or nxpi who
[00:39:48] had like 87% year on-year growth in
[00:39:52] semiconductor demand for Autos which is
[00:39:55] a nice look through for Cooper standard
[00:39:58] we'll see there was a plant shut down uh
[00:40:01] in June so you know we time will tell
[00:40:04] we'll see what the earnings tell us
[00:40:08] um Texas inum Instruments momentum
[00:40:11] across all markets United Rentals
[00:40:14] showing particular strength in
[00:40:16] manufacturing that's been a key part of
[00:40:18] our thesis there's been some mixed
[00:40:19] numbers but I think on balance it's
[00:40:21] recovering out of a 2-year
[00:40:23] recession uh Canadian Railways is moving
[00:40:27] right uh they're they're seeing let's
[00:40:29] see North America production trending
[00:40:30] slightly
[00:40:31] positive
[00:40:34] um Tesla people are underestimating this
[00:40:37] demand for grid storage probably by
[00:40:39] orders of magnitude which helps gener
[00:40:41] and we saw that
[00:40:44] uh okay alphabet the risk of
[00:40:47] underinvestigated
[00:40:57] the amount that they've been spending
[00:40:58] hoarding
[00:40:59] semiconductors uh would have to generate
[00:41:02] 600 billion of new Revenue in order to
[00:41:05] maintain margins so what you saw with
[00:41:07] Microsoft 77% growth in capex and a 15%
[00:41:12] growth in Revenue means their margins
[00:41:14] are going to go to hell in the short
[00:41:16] term which is why this rotation is going
[00:41:18] to be sustained and you're seeing
[00:41:20] decelerating earnings growth in uh big
[00:41:23] Tech and accelerating earnings growth in
[00:41:27] the
[00:41:28] unmagnify and small caps
[00:41:35] um Royal Caribbean robust booking and
[00:41:38] pricing uh earnings estimates are up 1%
[00:41:42] since July 1st so so that's a positive
[00:41:44] thing with
[00:41:47] um S&P up in aggregate the only group
[00:41:50] that's down is energy which is kind of
[00:41:53] interesting uh when you consider the
[00:41:56] data that just came out we used the most
[00:41:58] amount of natural gas for energy than
[00:42:00] we've ever used in history last month so
[00:42:02] that's positive financials are are the
[00:42:05] biggest part of the upward revisions we
[00:42:08] did take some City and Bank of America
[00:42:10] off in the last week or so um to lock in
[00:42:14] profits those have been big movers for
[00:42:16] us and um maybe we can redeploy at lower
[00:42:20] levels we'll see how that works out but
[00:42:22] sometimes you got to ring the register
[00:42:24] uh mentions of weak demand are also and
[00:42:27] Buffett you saw Buffett out there
[00:42:28] selling a ton of Bank of America I I
[00:42:30] don't really pay much attention to that
[00:42:33] anymore but it's been such aggressive
[00:42:35] selling uh that it was noted especially
[00:42:38] when you know they were overbought
[00:42:41] trading at a premium to book all the
[00:42:42] things that are the opposite of why I
[00:42:44] buy but I do want to get back into those
[00:42:46] because I don't think the banking cycle
[00:42:48] has even begun yet and um and we've got
[00:42:51] some still but um less than we did and
[00:42:54] and booked a nice profit on that if you
[00:42:56] look at the City chart it was uh a big
[00:42:59] one for us
[00:43:06] so okay moving along mentions of weak
[00:43:10] demand remain elevated but are rolling
[00:43:13] over this is what you see after Bottoms
[00:43:15] like 2009 to 2010 and mid 2000 to two
[00:43:19] 2020 to 2021 so that that rolling over
[00:43:22] same as midcycle 2012 and 13 so that's
[00:43:26] positive uh first EPS growth quarter for
[00:43:30] the other 493 we've talked about this
[00:43:32] this is the updated number numbers and
[00:43:36] what you're basically seeing
[00:43:39] here is
[00:43:43] Q3 mag 78 18% earnings growth but X mag
[00:43:48] 7 is 5% earnings
[00:43:51] growth
[00:43:53] um excuse
[00:43:55] me h
[00:43:58] Q2 okay yeah Q2 so this is the one we're
[00:44:00] seeing right now uh 30% was mag 7 7%
[00:44:05] was uh the other 493 but what you see
[00:44:09] here in first quarter of 2023 you had
[00:44:13] negative for for the 493 negative 1%
[00:44:17] then Q2 -7% then 0% growth for three
[00:44:20] quarter so this is the first inflecting
[00:44:22] quarter for the 493 and that's why
[00:44:24] you're see starting to see them uh uh
[00:44:27] tick up and you're going to see them
[00:44:28] continue to accelerate into Q4 to low
[00:44:32] double digits and sustain that for uh
[00:44:35] all the way through uh end of 2025 which
[00:44:39] is a big deal whereas the mag 7 which
[00:44:42] started the year at 53% earnings growth
[00:44:45] are going to decelerate all the way down
[00:44:47] to High teen still doing good numbers
[00:44:49] but that changes the multiple profile
[00:44:53] for some of these stocks especially when
[00:44:54] margins will uh compress from all the
[00:44:57] capex and Chip hoarding Q2 is expected
[00:45:01] okay we did that and that destocking
[00:45:05] cycle is coming to an end this has been
[00:45:07] our Core theme to The restocking cycle
[00:45:10] this is back to the uh midline here this
[00:45:14] is what you saw in 2010 at the beginning
[00:45:16] of the cycle in 2001 and two in the
[00:45:19] beginning of the cycle for multi- years
[00:45:21] that's very very positive that's why
[00:45:23] you're seeing Stanley Black and deck or
[00:45:25] 3M having its biggest one day move in
[00:45:27] history uh that one was a long time
[00:45:30] coming and but when it comes it comes
[00:45:31] all at once uh new orders inventory is
[00:45:34] ticking up so that's positive decade of
[00:45:38] underinvestment stuff is old private
[00:45:40] nonresidential fixed assets and
[00:45:43] structures um so there's a catch-up
[00:45:46] trade for cap capex manufacturing
[00:45:48] capacity starting to grow after 10 years
[00:45:50] of stagnation that's the onshoring theme
[00:45:54] earnings estimates we cover that risk
[00:45:57] reward still favorable to cyclicals this
[00:45:59] is the S&P 500 versus Russell 2000
[00:46:02] relative
[00:46:03] valuations um large is expensive small
[00:46:07] is cheap the historical mean is
[00:46:09] significantly above here and it you
[00:46:11] can't get anywhere near this low until
[00:46:14] you go all the way back to when 2001 and
[00:46:18] small caps had a monster historic Rally
[00:46:20] from 2001 to
[00:46:23] 2007 uh so yes 133% move in a month was
[00:46:26] a lot probably takes a
[00:46:29] breather love this new mug with the
[00:46:31] handle my buddy is down in
[00:46:34] Dallas
[00:46:36] um okay uspc inflation we we know all
[00:46:39] that's rolling over positioning across
[00:46:41] sector groups you're
[00:46:44] still uh with the Z scores dramatically
[00:46:48] overweight magnificent s which is why
[00:46:50] you continue to see that refresh you
[00:46:53] know um Nvidia got down almost below 100
[00:46:56] if you remember we put out the next pain
[00:46:58] trade article it was 100 got up to 139
[00:47:01] that day uh so it's down it's already
[00:47:04] done it uh it looks like you could get a
[00:47:08] counter Trend move in some of these tech
[00:47:11] stocks that have fallen a long way will
[00:47:13] keep an eye on it but um I think the
[00:47:17] trend is the rotation is going to stay
[00:47:19] intact
[00:47:21] so even if they bounce a bit I think
[00:47:25] they continue to underperform perform
[00:47:27] for the next 6 to 12 months while the
[00:47:29] rest of the market starts to
[00:47:30] outperform if you look at the
[00:47:32] positioning of Mega cap growth in Tech
[00:47:34] it's still extreme here
[00:47:41] um Equity positioning across sectors we
[00:47:44] covered that then you got the Russell
[00:47:46] 2000 to S&P 500 look how this thing
[00:47:49] turned the corner
[00:47:51] overnight uh when it comes it comes all
[00:47:54] at once so you can see that visually and
[00:47:56] for those those of you listening I you
[00:47:58] know if you listen that's fantastic if
[00:48:00] you watch it you will get more value
[00:48:02] because you can see things that you know
[00:48:05] I'm just a data person so I like to look
[00:48:07] at it but look listening is better than
[00:48:08] not you know not doing anything uh in
[00:48:11] terms of getting information you can see
[00:48:13] the equity sentiment was unchanged in in
[00:48:17] June it's kind of midlevel moving
[00:48:20] towards extreme but not anywhere near
[00:48:22] there yet Wake Me Up When September Ends
[00:48:25] annualized S&P price return by month so
[00:48:28] July is a great month and that was clear
[00:48:31] uh with a uh average 22% annualized so
[00:48:37] if you take it times 12 for those of you
[00:48:39] who don't aren't familiar with these
[00:48:40] terms uh August is not that bad it's
[00:48:43] more like June which can be choppy but
[00:48:45] tends to be okay September is kind of
[00:48:47] the worst month of the year so I think
[00:48:49] if we get continued strength for the
[00:48:51] next few weeks um there's also some
[00:48:54] stats I think I have the chart in here
[00:48:56] where after
[00:48:57] the first cut the first month is weak
[00:49:01] but then you get 3 months and 6 months
[00:49:03] 12 months it's all good good so that
[00:49:05] kind of lines up the 17th and 18th maybe
[00:49:08] we get would be nice to see strength
[00:49:10] into that if we could get strength into
[00:49:13] early September that's when we could
[00:49:15] start to get defensive and maybe put on
[00:49:17] some tactical shorts ahead of the
[00:49:19] election uh and then be positioned and
[00:49:21] create some extra free cash to ride the
[00:49:24] year-end postelection rally uh similar
[00:49:28] to uh 2016 for those of you were who
[00:49:31] were around only 5% of firms uh
[00:49:35] currently use AI suggesting limited
[00:49:37] growth I don't know if I agree with that
[00:49:38] second part of the statement but I think
[00:49:40] there is an overstatement as to the
[00:49:42] current value uh dividends likely to
[00:49:45] contribute more than during the past
[00:49:47] decade so in the past decade dividend
[00:49:51] return was 16% of Total return price
[00:49:54] return was 84 but if you go back to 19
[00:49:56] 36 through now uh dividends represented
[00:50:00] a third of the returns about 36% of the
[00:50:03] Returns versus price 64 which is in line
[00:50:06] with the 493 outperforming because most
[00:50:08] of them are dividend stocks and you see
[00:50:11] in our portfolio we have a lot of
[00:50:13] dividend stocks that have started to do
[00:50:15] exceptionally well so look at this
[00:50:17] moving forward China bond yields at
[00:50:19] all-time lows they're starting to defend
[00:50:22] this as we said watch this as an
[00:50:23] indicator for equities to start to turn
[00:50:25] that 26 to 2018 move 29 to 2011 this
[00:50:30] needs to turn it will all turn at once
[00:50:32] this is this is an extreme like we saw
[00:50:35] in 2020 and you got a monster rally into
[00:50:39] 2021 as well every time uh we expect
[00:50:42] another owner's equivalent rent in July
[00:50:46] fine that's great uh Dallas fed
[00:50:49] manufacturing this this is where you see
[00:50:51] the mixed stuff
[00:50:53] regionally uh excess covid related money
[00:50:56] has waned inflation should maintain its
[00:50:58] downward Trend Dallas fed manufacturing
[00:51:01] expected new orders so current new
[00:51:03] orders were not good expected new orders
[00:51:05] are looking really really good this is
[00:51:07] really coming out of a trough here so
[00:51:08] it's good to see uh little delinquency
[00:51:11] rate moving up in credit cards at the
[00:51:14] lower end of the consumer something to
[00:51:16] keep an eye on um um so noted and I'm
[00:51:21] sure the FED is looking at you know we
[00:51:23] hope the FED is looking at that as well
[00:51:25] but it's historically low even though
[00:51:27] it's rising share of households planning
[00:51:30] to move over the over the next 12 months
[00:51:32] has increased recently so with
[00:51:34] expectations of rates coming down I
[00:51:37] think people are finally going to say if
[00:51:38] they can get 25 or 50 basis points down
[00:51:41] they'll sell their house and finally
[00:51:43] move uh Japanese Yen leverage
[00:51:49] funds so that was at the extreme China's
[00:51:53] government bond yield we covered that
[00:51:55] this is the Bloomberg economic surprise
[00:51:57] index in purple relative to the S&P 500
[00:52:02] so this is starting to turn back up
[00:52:04] which is what we want to see uh the
[00:52:07] market came in a little bit to follow
[00:52:09] that but the market meaning the mag 7 in
[00:52:11] the capway did everything else went
[00:52:13] up uh here we have the kbe bank index
[00:52:19] had a Monster Month by the way up
[00:52:21] Regional Banks were up
[00:52:23] 18.3% last month which is unbelievable
[00:52:26] the basket not just one stock that had a
[00:52:28] good run the basket which means
[00:52:30] somewhere up 40% declining share of
[00:52:32] Americans say they're likely to consider
[00:52:34] buying an electric car uh weekly CL
[00:52:37] flows by client and sector so they were
[00:52:39] starting to flow out of tech finally
[00:52:41] today's largest seven are cheaper and of
[00:52:44] higher quality than 2,000 we've covered
[00:52:46] that in the past that's from NED Davis
[00:52:48] research uh showing us that we're not
[00:52:50] going to have another 90% down NASDAQ
[00:52:54] everyone pointing to the Cisco chart
[00:52:56] it's nothing like that because these do
[00:52:57] have earnings power they're decelerating
[00:52:59] earnings power but huge free cash flow
[00:53:02] and they'll get to a multiple attractive
[00:53:04] enough that bids will come in unless
[00:53:06] they dramatically overspend then they'll
[00:53:08] come down more uh this is job openings
[00:53:12] uh jolt has D dropped all the way back
[00:53:15] down to pre pandemic levels job quitting
[00:53:18] Falls to nearly fouryear low and job
[00:53:21] openings dip in sign labor market is
[00:53:23] cooling uh here's the quit rate collaps
[00:53:27] Bank of Japan raises Benchmark interest
[00:53:29] rate outlines road map for trimming Bond
[00:53:31] buying program so this all happened in
[00:53:33] the last week we said it was coming it's
[00:53:34] coming now it's here and that's caused a
[00:53:37] liquidity shock that we have to keep an
[00:53:39] eye on but I think the FED will use its
[00:53:40] other facilities to bridge time over the
[00:53:43] next six weeks and actually be in the
[00:53:44] market repurchasing rolloff Securities
[00:53:47] in size uh to keep the liquidity flowing
[00:53:50] until they actually do the cut here's
[00:53:53] the 2-year government bond yield
[00:53:55] starting to rip higher this
[00:53:57] year uh dollar Yen
[00:54:00] recovered 10year government bond yield I
[00:54:02] think broke below 4% today so that is
[00:54:06] remember we said
[00:54:08] 3.75% before 5% when everyone when it
[00:54:11] was at 490 and everyone was saying it
[00:54:14] was going back to five we said nope it's
[00:54:16] going to 375 before it goes to 5 and
[00:54:18] it's collapsed in that regard TLT is up
[00:54:21] big
[00:54:24] time real estate is biggest source of
[00:54:27] distressed bonds and Loans so everything
[00:54:28] else is looking good um this is really
[00:54:31] in the scheme of things 194 billion is
[00:54:34] is uh chicken feed relative to the
[00:54:36] overall Market you know $ 1220 trillion
[00:54:39] doll of assets delinquency rate of cmbs
[00:54:42] loans there's going to be a pony in the
[00:54:44] pile here for someone that gets this
[00:54:45] right but uh I think it's a little early
[00:54:48] foreclosures on the rise uh value of C's
[00:54:51] commercial properties again commercial
[00:54:53] capex growth slowed in 2018 19 amid
[00:54:57] trade War it's starting to pick pick up
[00:54:59] again um we covered the decelerating
[00:55:03] earnings of the mag7 momentum tilt is
[00:55:06] well above average this is starting to
[00:55:08] roll over so if you're in all the momo
[00:55:10] stocks get ready for some more pain if
[00:55:11] you Haven an experienced enough in Q in
[00:55:15] uh
[00:55:16] July this is the sler stuff uh from
[00:55:20] yesterday looked like Russell's trying
[00:55:22] to bottom here nasdaq's trying to bottom
[00:55:25] today check back my sense is um we
[00:55:30] probably get a bounce from here a lot of
[00:55:32] these tech stocks look oversold but we
[00:55:34] we'll
[00:55:35] see
[00:55:36] [Music]
[00:55:38] um just Instinct
[00:55:42] and it feels like this Market wants to
[00:55:45] hold up for another four to four four to
[00:55:47] six weeks into the next fed meeting and
[00:55:49] then sell the news but um that's not how
[00:55:52] we make our money anyway it really
[00:55:53] doesn't impact how many generators are
[00:55:55] going to be sold how many DeWalt uh uh
[00:55:58] TRS are uh Stanley TRS and DeWalt
[00:56:01] jackhammers are going to be sold uh and
[00:56:03] drill bits and everything else so we
[00:56:04] don't really worry about the day-to-day
[00:56:06] but we like to keep an eye on everything
[00:56:07] 10year yield yeah that broke this down
[00:56:09] trend line so that's good to see all of
[00:56:12] the stuff lining up for what we want to
[00:56:14] see in our portfolio and have started to
[00:56:16] see aggressively in the last four weeks
[00:56:19] Banks exposure is still one standard
[00:56:21] deviation below average so we're going
[00:56:24] to want to get involved again or or
[00:56:26] rebuild that position you know you city
[00:56:29] was a big move pulls back we can add add
[00:56:33] back uh like we've done with other
[00:56:35] stocks before uh beta C cyclical bullish
[00:56:39] exposure is near all-time lows uh this
[00:56:42] is what we want to take advantage of and
[00:56:45] uh dividend yield is starting to move up
[00:56:47] we were talking about it for months when
[00:56:49] it was all the way down here now it's
[00:56:50] starting to come in as we anticipated
[00:56:52] hedge fund
[00:56:54] positioning uh long positions through
[00:56:57] their estimating short positions
[00:56:59] Bas total short
[00:57:02] interest exposure to cyclical versus
[00:57:04] defensive sectors is at an all-time low
[00:57:08] so this is why when when hedge funds get
[00:57:11] this extreme against cyclical that's
[00:57:12] usually when you get the the move
[00:57:14] because they're caught off sides and
[00:57:15] they're the ones that chase uh
[00:57:17] discretionary is most shorted sector
[00:57:21] financials is the least shorted which is
[00:57:23] why it's kind of makes sense to uh
[00:57:27] shortterm having uh taken a some profits
[00:57:31] there in the short term uh highest net
[00:57:34] relative exposure to utilities lowest to
[00:57:37] energy if you remember we were pounding
[00:57:39] the tables on utilities a year ago
[00:57:40] they've had a Monster Run uh and now uh
[00:57:45] they can't get enough of them they'll
[00:57:46] probably continue to do well over time I
[00:57:49] haven't looked at let me just take a
[00:57:50] look at xlu here real quick but the fact
[00:57:54] that hedge funds are getting excited and
[00:57:55] crowding in probably tells me that it's
[00:57:58] time to take a little bit of a
[00:58:00] break um and then they hate energy so
[00:58:03] energy sold off those those will
[00:58:05] probably start to move uh sooner than we
[00:58:08] anticipate performance of the Russell
[00:58:11] 1,000 versus value versus growth uh from
[00:58:15] starting forward PE spreads 1995 to 2019
[00:58:19] so
[00:58:22] effectively in June 2024 we were at the
[00:58:25] 95th th percentile of growth over value
[00:58:30] and from that time period what you see
[00:58:33] is a dramatic outperformance of value as
[00:58:36] a matter of fact value outperformed
[00:58:40] growth by 7% in the month of June alone
[00:58:44] value was up some 5% growth was down
[00:58:47] some 2% uh so that was a one of the
[00:58:50] widest spreads then you see here value
[00:58:53] outperforms you you haven't seen
[00:58:57] value cheap relative to growth since
[00:59:00] 1937 and then next 30 years it was all
[00:59:05] value uh so um so this is setting up and
[00:59:08] that's also in line with more of the
[00:59:10] returns coming from dividends uh and um
[00:59:14] rates coming down and all of the things
[00:59:16] that go along with that and people are
[00:59:17] going to want to see cash flow and Tech
[00:59:20] margins coming down because they're
[00:59:21] going to do all this investment in AI uh
[00:59:24] here's a note from J
[00:59:26] they took the price Target up to 175
[00:59:30] from 145 opinion follows
[00:59:33] Trend um initial jobless claims these
[00:59:36] are the things that guarantee a cut in
[00:59:38] September this is Jeremy signal on Liz
[00:59:40] Clayman show by the way I will be on Fox
[00:59:43] Business the Clayman countdown live in
[00:59:45] studio with Liz Clayman tomorrow at 3
[00:59:48] P.M very excited about that so tune in
[00:59:50] if you're free but seagull was on today
[00:59:53] saying uh 50 basis points is is not off
[00:59:56] the table in September meaning they
[00:59:57] might have to play catchup bring out
[01:00:00] magnificent 7 to decelerated rest is
[01:00:02] expected to improve so that's a newer
[01:00:05] chart manufacturing PMI was weak this
[01:00:08] month so we got to keep an eye on that
[01:00:10] but there's some seasonality around that
[01:00:11] it was also weak uh mid last year as
[01:00:15] well continuing jobless claims really
[01:00:17] starting to spike up highest since
[01:00:20] November 27th
[01:00:22] 2021 initial jobless claims
[01:00:27] uh highest going all the way back to
[01:00:32] September uh and then more than 50% of
[01:00:36] 74 us CPI components are running below
[01:00:40] 2% for 3 months now so uh that's a big
[01:00:43] deal this is from fun Strat via Seth
[01:00:46] golden get your small caps uh what he's
[01:00:49] saying is that small caps early signal
[01:00:54] early cycle in 11 of 12 trading sessions
[01:00:57] the Russell 2000 traded plusus 1% only
[01:00:59] occurred 10 times since 1979 outside of
[01:01:02] recessions and bare marks early signal
[01:01:04] given years
[01:01:06] 8798 2009 2011 2020 uh forward returns
[01:01:11] and positivity rates 1 month out up 10%
[01:01:14] we saw that last month 3 months out up
[01:01:16] 18% 6 months out up 31% 12 months out up
[01:01:21] 51% uh all with a 100 positivity rate
[01:01:24] after you get past that first first
[01:01:26] month which we had in July so expect
[01:01:29] more to come meaning potentially another
[01:01:32] 40% more to come in small caps uh this
[01:01:36] is also from Tom Lee via Seth golden
[01:01:39] 2-year yield minus bed fun funds rate
[01:01:41] Gap is a big risk on Signal which
[01:01:44] anticipates a 4 to 5% S&P 500 rally
[01:01:48] ahead which would imply we do get a
[01:01:50] bounce from the tech Magnificent Seven
[01:01:53] stocks that have been beat down in as a
[01:01:56] matter of fact that basket after I went
[01:01:58] on and talked about the C change out of
[01:01:59] the Magnificent 7 into the UNM
[01:02:01] magnificent
[01:02:02] 493 um that basket there's an ETF called
[01:02:08] Big
[01:02:10] T uh that is the Magnificent 7 and it
[01:02:14] dropped 15% over the next few weeks the
[01:02:16] Magnificent 7 while the rest of the
[01:02:19] stuff like Banks were up 18% and
[01:02:21] everything else new vehicle total
[01:02:23] inventory this is exactly what we wanted
[01:02:26] to see we're going to start to see more
[01:02:28] incentives and more reasons to get
[01:02:30] people out replacing those 13 and a half
[01:02:32] year old cars uh which is going to be a
[01:02:35] big deal and margins for the oems are
[01:02:38] going to go down because they're going
[01:02:39] to be in price Wars but doing big
[01:02:42] volumes and like like generators when
[01:02:44] your neighbor gets one you want one and
[01:02:46] we're going to get a big refresh cycling
[01:02:48] cars as the prices come down as rates
[01:02:50] come down as incentives go up as
[01:02:53] inventories build it's a good thing for
[01:02:55] for Cooper standard which is not in the
[01:02:58] arms War it's in the arms dealing
[01:03:01] business which is what we want to be
[01:03:04] in
[01:03:08] um okay here's another
[01:03:10] thing from uh Jim Paulson via Seth Seth
[01:03:14] golden uh basically he's talking about
[01:03:17] when the 10year yield Falls and M2 money
[01:03:19] supply Rises like they are now
[01:03:21] historically S&P delivers higher returns
[01:03:23] than when these two variables are not
[01:03:24] moving in opposite opposite directions
[01:03:27] so while everyone knows September Is A
[01:03:30] bad month when both of these things are
[01:03:33] happening 10 yield is falling and money
[01:03:36] supply is rising you often get positive
[01:03:40] months so that could actually throw the
[01:03:43] weakness pre-election weakness idea and
[01:03:45] September weakness and sell the news
[01:03:48] weakness out the window I wouldn't bet
[01:03:50] on that but I
[01:03:52] like the fact that I like the idea
[01:03:55] despite what you saw today I like the
[01:03:57] ideaa
[01:03:59] that um the market holds up into
[01:04:02] September we we will see uh some of that
[01:04:06] will have to do with Apple earnings
[01:04:08] which I think we're okay after hours I'm
[01:04:10] just looking at the screen while I'm
[01:04:11] talking and
[01:04:14] Amazon uh so we'll see how those come in
[01:04:16] if those two can bounce even if Nvidia
[01:04:19] keeps falling uh I think that uh we'll
[01:04:22] get the bounce in the S&P 500
[01:04:26] first time since 2020 that we've seen
[01:04:28] six straight declines in the 10-year
[01:04:31] yield of two basis points or more uh so
[01:04:34] that's that the change in the FED
[01:04:37] statement here uh leads to September for
[01:04:41] sure ADP
[01:04:43] employment I think we're getting close
[01:04:45] to the end
[01:04:46] here and then July performance this is
[01:04:49] very important I just ran these numbers
[01:04:51] in in advance of going on claiming
[01:04:53] tomorrow for July the S&P was only up 1%
[01:04:58] Dow was up 4.5% Russell small caps were
[01:05:02] up
[01:05:02] 10.4% and the NASDAQ was down
[01:05:06] 1.68% small Banks were up
[01:05:10] 18.6% reats were up 75% utilities were
[01:05:14] up 7% Industrials were up 5% and mag 7
[01:05:18] was down 35 basis points semiconductors
[01:05:21] were down 5% here's 80% of global
[01:05:25] Central Bank are expected to be in
[01:05:26] easing mode by the end of 2024 versus
[01:05:28] only 10% in July 2023 that's good news
[01:05:32] but right now
[01:05:34] Japan is tightening and not enough of
[01:05:37] the West
[01:05:39] is uh easing yet so I think you could
[01:05:43] see some choppiness unless they use
[01:05:45] other facilities to paper it over until
[01:05:48] September
[01:05:50] uh consensus 12-month forward EPS growth
[01:05:53] projections continue to Trend up across
[01:05:55] regions that's Asia Pacific Europe and
[01:05:59] the US that's
[01:06:00] positive more often than not the s&p500
[01:06:03] delivered robust returns following the
[01:06:06] first fed cut here's the S&P return
[01:06:09] since 1950 when the US economy did not
[01:06:11] see a recession within a year of the
[01:06:13] first Fed rate cut so first month after
[01:06:17] the average return is negative -3% so we
[01:06:22] want to keep that in mind as we you know
[01:06:24] if we show continued strength into
[01:06:27] mid-september before the FED meeting
[01:06:29] that will be an opportunity for us to
[01:06:31] get more defensive raise some cash maybe
[01:06:34] put on some tactical shorts uh for that
[01:06:37] month into the election and then two
[01:06:39] months after you're up on average 7% 3
[01:06:41] months after up 10% uh 6 months after
[01:06:45] 12% 12 months after 15% so I think this
[01:06:48] time will be similar moving along um
[01:06:52] sentiment survey basically no change
[01:06:54] since last week uh bearishness went down
[01:06:57] bullishness ticked up and then onto some
[01:07:00] China stuff then we'll get to the US and
[01:07:02] then we'll wind up AI race uh Alibaba 10
[01:07:05] cent a quickly adopt meta new llama 3
[01:07:07] Model adid excitement hedge funds post
[01:07:10] biggest Retreat on bearish Yen bets
[01:07:13] since 2011 they were the most short that
[01:07:15] they've ever been and of course you had
[01:07:17] the most abrupt rally ever all of the
[01:07:20] most crowded trades from July have
[01:07:23] Unwound uh long magn magnificent 7 was
[01:07:26] the most crowded trade they got
[01:07:28] shellacked um they had a 15% draw down
[01:07:31] and depending on the company a lot more
[01:07:33] than that if you were in Nvidia it was
[01:07:34] like
[01:07:35] 3540
[01:07:37] 35 you about you lost about a 30 your
[01:07:39] money from that day we put out the pain
[01:07:41] trade article
[01:07:44] um
[01:07:45] then uh short small caps was a crowded
[01:07:48] trade that Unwound short Yen was a
[01:07:51] crowded trade that Unwound and short
[01:07:53] China equities was a trade it's trying
[01:07:55] to unwind but it's just kind of grinding
[01:07:57] sideways uh we'll see what earnings
[01:07:59] season has to uh to do for that
[01:08:03] alibaba's International AI toolkit hits
[01:08:06] half a million Merchant adopters so all
[01:08:08] this stuff happening in the back
[01:08:09] background doesn't matter until it does
[01:08:11] China industrial profits climb showing
[01:08:13] manufacturing strength doesn't matter
[01:08:15] until it does Alibaba share jump on
[01:08:17] plans to Boost service fee for merchants
[01:08:19] doesn't matter until it does uh Japan
[01:08:22] wanted higher inflation it's here and it
[01:08:24] hurts so there you go everyone who
[01:08:26] chased uh Chinese equities after they
[01:08:28] were up uh a gazillion uh are now uh
[01:08:32] starting to Second think that Alibaba

[01:08:40] xiin ping calls for faster measures to

[01:08:45] out of the poit burrow meeting again
[01:08:48] doesn't matter until it does but all
[01:08:50] these things are happening in the
[01:08:51] background and then they're all going to
[01:08:52] matter all at once alibaba's tow bath

[01:09:27] tools could come this summer veteran
[01:09:29] says this was a big mistake to uh cut
[01:09:32] them off because before they were not
[01:09:35] doing aggressive research and were
[01:09:37] dependent on us for their whole growth
[01:09:40] now they've been forced to learn how to
[01:09:41] do it themselves which basically means
[01:09:43] they they pull our best scientists pay
[01:09:45] them a lot more money and steal all of
[01:09:48] our intellectual property whereas before
[01:09:50] we could just sell it to them and make
[01:09:51] money but that's the policy of the the
[01:09:54] current administ
[01:09:55] and we'll see the effect of that as time

[01:10:20] of the opinion the numbers are either

[01:10:25] to to that Financial Times articles we
[01:10:27] referenced 8 weeks ago Japanese stocks
[01:10:30] fall as inv investors fear effects of
[01:10:32] sto stronger Yen that was from this
[01:10:35] morning Japan raises interest rates for
[01:10:37] second time since 2007 Disney Plus Hulu
[01:10:40] and Max launched their new streaming
[01:10:42] bundle at a 38% discount so this is
[01:10:45] going to start to get traction and then
[01:10:46] by the end of the year they're going to
[01:10:47] add ESPN which will be an Unstoppable
[01:10:50] bundle and this is what value act did at
[01:10:54] uh Salesforce New York Times and
[01:10:58] um Spotify and they turned around all
[01:11:01] three companies they're going to do the
[01:11:02] same thing with Disney Disney's getting
[01:11:05] zero credit for its streaming and media
[01:11:08] and theatrical release business uh the
[01:11:12] uh Parks experiences and consumer
[01:11:14] products are worth about $80 to $90 a
[01:11:16] share that's what the Market's pricing
[01:11:18] it's giving zero value for 153 million
[01:11:22] uh subscribers at Disney plus compared
[01:11:25] to Netflix has 277 million and they're
[01:11:28] valued at a quarter of a trillion
[01:11:29] dollars so we think that that business
[01:11:32] is worth uh a lot more okay than zero
[01:11:36] and uh and that's why we think it can be
[01:11:38] $180 $200 stock in the next three or so
[01:11:40] years opinion not advice check your

[01:11:57] Market didn't really respond because of
[01:11:59] everything else going on y3m stock fro
[01:12:02] 23% on Friday uh so all that's coming
[01:12:06] the new CEO is doing a great job we'll
[01:12:08] cover some of that in our article of the
[01:12:10] week Buffett Cuts Bank of America stake
[01:12:12] unloading $3 billion this month so uh
[01:12:15] most crowded trades are getting
[01:12:18] liquidated we saw that coming PayPal
[01:12:21] stock Rises sharply after beat and rais
[01:12:23] quarter we're going to cover that 3M had
[01:12:25] its very best day ever the new CEO
[01:12:27] started with a bang uh we'll cover that
[01:12:30] in a troubled box office premium still
[01:12:32] sells that was the biggest R rated movie
[01:12:34] launch ever uh Deadpool and Wolverine is
[01:12:36] owned by Marvel owned by Disney uh so
[01:12:41] that's two monster Blockbusters in the
[01:12:43] same year markets attributing zero value
[01:12:46] to that inside out was a billion inside
[01:12:48] out to was a billion doll uh deal and
[01:12:50] Deadpool is going to be a beast as well
[01:12:52] Nvidia stock swon didn't slow CEO Jon
[01:12:55] Wong sales so he continues to dump
[01:12:57] stocks on all the retail investors head
[01:12:59] who bought the split Wall Street says
[01:13:01] buy stocks that pay dividends with $6
[01:13:03] trillion doll of cash ready to be
[01:13:05] deployed as rates come down uh they're
[01:13:08] going to be forced out of their money
[01:13:10] markets and everything else and they're
[01:13:11] going to go into dividend stocks and
[01:13:13] that's where value is going to out
[01:13:14] continue to outperform growth PayPal
[01:13:17] stock stores as earnings bring big
[01:13:18] positive surprise on this key number
[01:13:20] what's the key number is transaction
[01:13:22] margin dollars which was the name of the
[01:13:24] game game that everyone was worried
[01:13:26] about and they've turned the corner as
[01:13:28] anticipated that move is just beginning
[01:13:30] Bank of England decision another Central
[01:13:32] Bank Cuts ahead of the FED Disney bets
[01:13:35] on Deadpool Wolverine and dirty jokes to
[01:13:37] save Marvel whatever it takes like I
[01:13:39] told you Bob Iger will play Bible movies
[01:13:42] 24/7 if it means iida will go back up
[01:13:44] they learned their lessons they went
[01:13:46] woke but they don't want to go broke so
[01:13:48] they're pivoting xbo earnings show us
[01:13:51] manufacturing improved shares rise fed
[01:13:55] path for September interest rate cut
[01:13:57] that's after the fact Tim maros the FED
[01:13:59] Whisperer wrote that so it's telling us
[01:14:01] what we already know there's gun laac
[01:14:03] saying they should have cut yesterday we
[01:14:05] agree us productivity rebounds sharply
[01:14:08] in the second quarter which could help a
[01:14:10] soft Landing so you're seeing all these
[01:14:12] mixed things there's enough good
[01:14:14] happening to overcome the FED sucking
[01:14:16] its thumb but uh if they suck for too
[01:14:20] long we're going to wind up with uh some
[01:14:22] issues so uh and it's going to cost them
[01:14:24] much more go down as one of the worst
[01:14:27] fed chairs in history versus one of the
[01:14:29] best and then the difference between
[01:14:31] those two binary outcomes could be you
[01:14:33] know two months difference uh or in this
[01:14:36] case six or eight weeks but I think he
[01:14:37] can get away with uh sitting on his
[01:14:40] hands in July but he won't be able to
[01:14:42] get away with sitting on his hands in
[01:14:43] September initial jobless claims rise to
[01:14:46] onee high as hiring slows that's the key
[01:14:48] message China revs up us up fiscal
[01:14:52] policy support to Spur economic recovery
[01:14:54] so they're back back at it can Kelly
[01:14:56] ortberg turn Boeing around people like
[01:14:59] him from Rockwell Collins uh he had a
[01:15:03] huge run with his stock while he was
[01:15:04] running that I think he's going to do
[01:15:06] the same for Boeing since 1995 value
[01:15:09] stocks have always outperformed when
[01:15:10] they're this cheap by a big
[01:15:13] margin and uh so we covered these two
[01:15:16] charts earlier Intel to cut okay so
[01:15:19] Intel reported after hours their stock
[01:15:21] is down I want to listen to the call
[01:15:23] he's going to be on CNBC tomorrow my
[01:15:25] guess is if he was if it was a disaster
[01:15:27] he would throw his CFO on instead of
[01:15:30] himself so he'll he'll be there tomorrow
[01:15:32] to talk it up but this really does not
[01:15:34] change the long-term strategy so they're
[01:15:36] cutting a bunch of costs they miss bu a
[01:15:38] hair um I'll wait and uh listen to the
[01:15:42] call tonight before we add any shares or
[01:15:44] make a decision whether we're going to
[01:15:45] add any shares but we're comfortable
[01:15:46] with ours if you remember we bought it
[01:15:49] 25 we sold 2/3 at 20 at 48 and then we
[01:15:53] re rebuilt the position between 29 and
[01:15:56] 31 so we've made some money on it the
[01:15:58] question is do we want to add more back
[01:16:00] at 25 or 24 wherever is it is after
[01:16:03] hours and uh after the call I'll make
[01:16:05] that decision but um uh more likely than
[01:16:08] not uh I think it it makes sense and uh
[01:16:13] unless I hear something in the call
[01:16:14] that's uh egregious but the Legacy
[01:16:17] business so they Revenue declined by 1%
[01:16:20] that's not the end of the world um and
[01:16:22] remember the whole growth story story is
[01:16:25] the 45 billion of Grants tax breaks and
[01:16:28] Loans from the US government to to stand
[01:16:30] up a duopoly with Taiwan semiconductor
[01:16:34] that all the Western Fortune 500s are
[01:16:36] going to push their demand through uh
[01:16:39] due to government pressure so um that's
[01:16:42] not in the numbers yet Canada Goose
[01:16:45] reported uh surprising because it
[01:16:47] surprisingly okay given that it's off
[01:16:51] seon they were able so the wholesale
[01:16:53] continues to go down the directed
[01:16:54] consumer continues to go up which is
[01:16:55] going to increase margins over time
[01:16:58] which we like China was up again I was a
[01:17:00] little worried about China because every
[01:17:02] other company had china down uh but
[01:17:04] China was actually up and Asia Pacific
[01:17:08] was up so those were strong reg
[01:17:10] regions
[01:17:12] um uh overall for the company revenues
[01:17:15] were up a few percent and then their
[01:17:17] their margins were a little bit worse
[01:17:20] because they bought a new Factory that
[01:17:22] they have to take the cost out of so
[01:17:24] they had some impact but revenues for
[01:17:26] the quarter were up you know 5%
[01:17:29] basically uh from 84 to 88 million year
[01:17:32] on year so uh so the business continues
[01:17:35] to do well and is what is considered to
[01:17:37] be a week quarter so I'll listen to that
[01:17:39] one that one came out today as well uh
[01:17:41] Pals TRS and towels stock market and
[01:17:44] sentiment results we had some really
[01:17:46] good earnings results in the last week
[01:17:47] pretty excited about
[01:17:49] that um and I think ultimately what
[01:17:52] you're going to see here and what I was
[01:17:54] trying to talk to uh Neil Cavuto about
[01:17:57] was that you've got an AI arms race
[01:17:59] between Microsoft Google and
[01:18:01] Amazon uh and the arms
[01:18:06] dealers look like they're
[01:18:09] winning which is Invidia AMD and Intel
[01:18:12] in the short term but I think you're
[01:18:14] going to
[01:18:15] see um couple of the things is that
[01:18:19] you've got like you saw AMD earnings
[01:18:21] were good because demand for their gpus
[01:18:24] went up so not everyone wants
[01:18:27] only
[01:18:29] um Nvidia and if you
[01:18:32] saw meta's report yeah they were going
[01:18:36] to have like 100,000 uh h100s but then
[01:18:39] another
[01:18:41] 350,000 uh other gpus which you know
[01:18:45] other is could be Intel as we know the
[01:18:49] gouty 3 is 50% faster 50% cheaper and
[01:18:52] uses 40% less energy which is a huge
[01:18:55] operating cost for these data centers
[01:18:57] for the hyperscalers so
[01:19:01] um so I think nvidia's margin is going
[01:19:05] to be
[01:19:06] Intel opportunity and then Microsoft
[01:19:10] Google and Amazon in short term are
[01:19:12] going to have declining margins as they
[01:19:14] continue aggressive cap X until the
[01:19:16] shareholders stop them but seoa put out
[01:19:19] the key article which was the $600
[01:19:20] billion question which says that the
[01:19:22] amount that they're spending right now
[01:19:24] is not even remotely justified by
[01:19:26] earnings so their margins are going to
[01:19:28] crash and that's why you see the
[01:19:30] decelerating earnings in that group and
[01:19:32] that they're uh stock started
[01:19:34] to um move
[01:19:38] down
[01:19:39] okay PayPal update
[01:19:43] so they had their best transaction
[01:19:46] margin dollar growth since 2021 they
[01:19:48] raised their 2024 guidance and increased
[01:19:51] the share repurchase they're coming from
[01:19:53] a position of strength so so what does
[01:19:55] that mean the most important thing that
[01:19:57] came out of this call is that they said
[01:19:59] uh we're not going to do $5 billion of
[01:20:02] free cash flow this year we're actually
[01:20:04] going to do $6 billion of free cash flow
[01:20:07] this year and you can't give away the
[01:20:09] stock it's mind-boggling oh and by the
[01:20:11] way we're not going to buy $5 billion of
[01:20:13] stock back uh this year like we did last
[01:20:16] year we're going to buy $6 billion back
[01:20:19] of stock uh which means you're going to
[01:20:21] own a bigger slice of the pie without
[01:20:23] putting any new money out of pocket
[01:20:26] revenues were up 8% transaction margin
[01:20:28] dollars were up 8% year on year
[01:20:30] operating income was up 17% year on year
[01:20:32] operating margin expanded 126 basis
[01:20:35] points EPS increased 177% that's a
[01:20:38] Growth Company ladies and gentlemen uh
[01:20:41] not a value trap that's a Growth Company
[01:20:43] total payment volume up 11% payment
[01:20:45] transactions 8% they even re accelerated
[01:20:49] active accounts uh by almost 2 million
[01:20:54] SE qu qually from last quarter to this
[01:20:56] quarter and generated 1.4 billion of
[01:20:58] free cash flow in this quarter alone
[01:21:00] they've got $18 billion of cash by the
[01:21:02] way uh net cash about 6 billion 12
[01:21:06] billion of debt returned 1.5 billion to
[01:21:09] stockholders buying 24 million shares of
[01:21:11] common stock at low prices by the way
[01:21:14] which is when you want them to buy it
[01:21:15] which is the name of the game so you can
[01:21:17] see here every metric basically up
[01:21:20] margins up revenues up transactions up
[01:21:23] share count collapsing went from in uh
[01:21:28] 2023 uh 1.1
[01:21:32] billion to uh just over
[01:21:36] 1.04 billion so they've taken out you
[01:21:41] know
[01:21:43] 6 60 million shares give or take no 60
[01:21:48] 58 78 million shares I mean that's
[01:21:51] pretty awesome and that's going to go
[01:21:52] down they're going to be below a billion
[01:21:54] shares which is pretty exciting
[01:21:57] um all right then you got uh adjusted
[01:22:01] free cash flow active accounts were up 2
[01:22:04] million
[01:22:07] sequentially
[01:22:10] um transactions per active account up
[01:22:13] 11% driven by brain free transaction
[01:22:15] growth which is what everyone hated
[01:22:17] because it brought the overall margins
[01:22:18] and take rate down now that's
[01:22:20] reaccelerating remember fast lane
[01:22:22] increased conversion from 50% to 880 %
[01:22:24] that's rolling out in Earnest the second
[01:22:26] half that's going to be huge for the
[01:22:28] company their ad business is rolling out
[01:22:31] they just did a deal with door Dash and
[01:22:33] others uh then you've got uh their
[01:22:35] guidance they took up not only on free
[01:22:37] cash flow and BuyBacks but they took up
[01:22:39] their
[01:22:40] transaction
[01:22:43] um margin dollars uh from before
[01:22:47] slightly positive to low to mid single
[01:22:49] digit growth for fiscal year 2024 for uh
[01:22:54] non-gaap non-transaction operating
[01:22:56] expenses then you've got effective tax
[01:23:00] rate that's not a big deal EPS they went
[01:23:03] from mid to high single digigit growth
[01:23:06] to low to mid teens growth that is a
[01:23:10] monstrous difference and then they took
[01:23:12] up their Gap EPS to 388 to 398 range
[01:23:16] from
[01:23:17] 365 which is another huge jump and then
[01:23:20] free cash flow and share repurchase so
[01:23:22] it's huge absolutely hug huge venmo
[01:23:25] momentum continues to build in monthly
[01:23:27] active accounts increased across PayPal
[01:23:29] and venmo fast lane and ads platform is

[01:24:49] the way they're putting ascribing zero
[01:24:52] to their guidance raise to the benefits
[01:24:54] that fast Lane's going to bring to their
[01:24:55] margin which are going to be off the
[01:24:56] charts fast lane will accelerate
[01:24:58] PayPal's ability to capture roughly 60%

[01:25:40] 8% year-over-year with monthly active
[01:25:42] increasing 5% year over year to nearly
[01:25:45] 62 million both a strong base of
[01:25:47] peer-to-peer users and Adoption of our
[01:25:49] ecosystem of products are driving this
[01:25:51] growth for example both venmo debit card
[01:25:53] and pay with venmo monthly active users
[01:25:55] grew
[01:25:58] 30% uh we launched a push provisioning
[01:26:01] of the venmo debit card to Apple and
[01:26:03] Google wallets and continue to enable
[01:26:05] PayPal pay with venmo with merchants and
[01:26:08] partners including eBay and StubHub
[01:26:11] recently launched venmo teen venmo is
[01:26:13] primed for growth making it easier to
[01:26:14] add PayPal and venmo branded cards to
[01:26:17] Apple and Google Wallets on mobile
[01:26:19] devices etc etc
[01:26:22] so uh we were encouraged to see the
[01:26:24] sustained total active account growing
[01:26:26] growth following a positive inflection
[01:26:28] in the first quarter so they went from
[01:26:30] Contracting to expansion that's what you
[01:26:32] want to see at inflection points um
[01:26:36] transactions per active account which is
[01:26:38] a triling 12mth number with 60.9 in the
[01:26:40] second quarter up 11% transactions per
[01:26:43] active account grew 6% total payment
[01:26:45] volume grew
[01:26:47] 11% uh and total payment volume
[01:26:50] International also grew 11% Etc so
[01:26:54] there's just unbelievable things
[01:26:56] happening since this guy took over
[01:26:58] PayPal generated 1.4 billion in free
[01:26:59] cash flow 1.5 billion in share purchases
[01:27:02] bringing repurchases to 5 billion
[01:27:04] raising our
[01:27:05] guidance uh re accelerating durable
[01:27:08] profitable growth for the company given
[01:27:10] the strong start to the year we are
[01:27:11] raising our free cash flow guidance we
[01:27:13] covered that grew profitably venmo
[01:27:16] customers venmo ecosystem fast lane
[01:27:18] conversion from 50 to 80% we covered um
[01:27:23] okay regarding Apple page let let me
[01:27:25] though set the context of the reality
[01:27:27] today and then how we think about the
[01:27:28] future so reality today we are the
[01:27:30] number one branded experience across all
[01:27:33] platforms and devices if we narrow down
[01:27:35] into desktop web which is still 40 to
[01:27:37] 50% of all checkout we need we see no
[01:27:41] degradation in our share over the past
[01:27:43] four years let me say that again we've
[01:27:45] held share despite competition second if
[01:27:48] we look across browsers there's actually
[01:27:49] no difference in our selection rate
[01:27:52] across different browsers so certain
[01:27:53] buttons moving from one platform to
[01:27:55] another just isn't material to us so
[01:27:57] that's where we are today let us focus
[01:27:59] on our ability branded experience rolled
[01:28:02] out to 80% EXA rate okay so they're
[01:28:06] basically talking about their strategy
[01:28:09] Stanley Black and Decker so I mean these
[01:28:10] have these things are starting to move
[01:28:13] Stanley Black and& Decker up from 77 to
[01:28:16] $107 in the last you know month uh
[01:28:19] that's a pretty big
[01:28:21] move um basically they had lower
[01:28:24] inventory destocking uh costs which is
[01:28:27] going to lead to restocking like we've
[01:28:29] said uh change supply chain
[01:28:31] transformation benefits and reduce
[01:28:33] shipping costs they should just
[01:28:34] Outsource the gxo by the way uh on track
[01:28:37] for expected pre-tax run rate Savings of
[01:28:39] 1.5 billion by the end of 2024 they've
[01:28:41] already done 1.3 and two billion by the
[01:28:43] end of 2025 I think we had done the math
[01:28:46] on that and uh it was
[01:28:50] like it was worth like $80 a share at at
[01:28:54] the normal historic multiple and that
[01:28:56] excludes the business but anyway let's
[01:28:58] just stick to the facts here uh organic
[01:29:01] Revenue growth led by DeWalt which is
[01:29:02] good gross margin was up 600 basis
[01:29:04] points to 28.4 their goal is to get to
[01:29:07] 30 back to 35% which they will um cash
[01:29:11] from operating activities was 573
[01:29:13] million free cash flow was 486 million
[01:29:16] that's what you want to see in a
[01:29:17] turnaround story they have Runway uh
[01:29:20] they raise their earnings guidance to a
[01:29:26] basically 8040 basically 410 midpoint
[01:29:30] from a 4.0 midpoint so 370 to 450 from
[01:29:33] 350 to 450 and they raised their free
[01:29:36] cash flow to uh 750 million midpoint
[01:29:40] from a $700 million midpoint so that's
[01:29:43] huge uh supply chain
[01:29:46] improvements volume growth
[01:29:48] reaccelerating all the things you want
[01:29:50] to
[01:29:52] hear uh Cost Cuts in and then getting
[01:29:54] back to growth and getting getting
[01:29:56] revenues growing again so they're
[01:29:57] focused on all of it 3M again huge move
[01:30:00] here since February or or last you know
[01:30:03] if you go into the fall remember the
[01:30:04] last quarter we had that huge run from
[01:30:06] 68 to 90 then it checked back to 74 it's
[01:30:09] gone from 74 to 128 in the last four
[01:30:12] months this one's a beast plus we also
[01:30:14] got svent for free uh with the spin-off
[01:30:17] so uh you know these things take time
[01:30:19] but when they go they go all at once um
[01:30:22] so their organic growth was up modestly
[01:30:25] their Gap EPS was up
[01:30:28] 117% adjusted EPS up 39% operating CA uh
[01:30:33] cash flow a billion adjusted free cash
[01:30:35] flow was 1.2 billion so they free cash
[01:30:38] flow generative and they are uh
[01:30:42] increasing their guidance from
[01:30:43] [Music]
[01:30:45] a 705 midpoint to a 715 midpoint which
[01:30:49] is really
[01:30:50] good uh and everything's hitting on all
[01:30:53] cylinders again new CEO new jockey
[01:30:55] turnaround story and things moving in
[01:30:57] the right direction they returned 786
[01:31:00] million to shareholders via dividends
[01:31:02] and share
[01:31:04] repurchases um and moved up their end
[01:31:07] point so you can go through some of
[01:31:09] these on the different divisions whether
[01:31:11] it's safety and Industrial
[01:31:12] Transportation Electronics consumer full
[01:31:14] year
[01:31:15] guidance they took their adjusted
[01:31:17] operating margin up uh from a 237 bips
[01:31:23] midpoint increased to a 250 bip so
[01:31:26] they're they're they're going faster
[01:31:28] than they expected which is a good thing
[01:31:30] and uh all is in place so they've talked
[01:31:33] about spinning out the business all the
[01:31:35] things that they've already accomplished
[01:31:37] and uh strong balance sheet we
[01:31:39] repurchased about 400 million of stock
[01:31:41] in the second quarter have the capacity
[01:31:43] to do more in the second half of next
[01:31:45] year they're going to do Acquisitions
[01:31:47] I'll be taking a fresh dispassionate
[01:31:49] look not only at am m&a but uh at our
[01:31:52] portfolio to determine if there's any
[01:31:53] asss that have greater value owned by
[01:31:55] others along the same line what assets
[01:31:57] might be a good fit for 3M I don't have
[01:31:59] anything to say on that yet so he's he's
[01:32:01] doing a portfolio management which is a
[01:32:02] good thing moving on retail earnings top
[01:32:05] 30 weights of the sector uh estimates
[01:32:07] were revised up for next year by three
[01:32:10] bips down for this year by 62 bips
[01:32:13] transports were both both revised down
[01:32:15] for this year and next year 340 bips and
[01:32:18] 360 bips so you have to keep an eye on
[01:32:20] it my guess is that's skewed to one
[01:32:22] company though so Uber uh has come down
[01:32:26] uh no let's see
[01:32:31] here let's see where the big hit was
[01:32:34] FedEx a little bit oh probably UPS
[01:32:36] where's
[01:32:37] UPS yeah UPS was a big contributor to
[01:32:41] that
[01:32:45] um s a a
[01:32:58] and those look like the the big ones all
[01:33:01] right uh tomorrow we've got uh the jobs
[01:33:04] report expected private non-farm
[01:33:07] payrolls expected to be plus
[01:33:10] 176 um we probably want to see a bit
[01:33:14] lower than
[01:33:15] 176 uh in order to keep the September
[01:33:19] guarantee on the table but not so much
[01:33:21] more that people panic that there's no
[01:33:24] back stop before September so uh you
[01:33:27] don't want to see a a super low number
[01:33:30] also watch the revisions downward and
[01:33:33] then finally this is the stuff that's
[01:33:35] holding up the market you know earning
[01:33:37] here are margins are reaccelerating from
[01:33:39] the dstock to the restock cycle and then
[01:33:42] you see uh earnings growth is 9.8 versus
[01:33:45] 88.9% estimates uh as I said
[01:33:48] expectations were High secret happiness
[01:33:50] is low expectations so it's coming in
[01:33:51] higher but not as high above as it had
[01:33:54] in previous quarters so you're getting a
[01:33:56] little chop here and then uh estimates
[01:33:59] have been a little soft the last few
[01:34:00] months so we want to see a little re
[01:34:02] acceleration we saw 1% since the
[01:34:03] beginning of July let's see if that
[01:34:05] persists after we get to the end of this
[01:34:07] week with so many companies having
[01:34:09] reported so let's get on to uh well
[01:34:13] first off uh I great I I want to say I I
[01:34:18] showed gratitude for all the clients and
[01:34:20] all the new clients I want to express my
[01:34:22] gratitude for for all the longtime
[01:34:24] listeners that have been with us since
[01:34:27] the beginning that have recently joined
[01:34:28] us uh but most importantly those that
[01:34:31] take the time to comment and like And
[01:34:33] subscribe on the YouTube channel that
[01:34:35] really drives growth because when they
[01:34:37] see a lot of likes and a lot of
[01:34:39] subscribes and a lot of common activity
[01:34:42] they show it to more people that are
[01:34:43] interested in the stock market when they
[01:34:45] log into YouTube so the more you do that
[01:34:48] the better and especially for those of
[01:34:50] you who have taken the time to just
[01:34:52] share it with one or two friends or
[01:34:54] family members that love the markets
[01:34:57] that you think would benefit from this
[01:34:59] information uh because that also leads
[01:35:01] us to to some great people that wind up
[01:35:04] becoming clients that wind up becoming
[01:35:06] longtime listeners and users and we're
[01:35:08] very very grateful for that so without
[01:35:10] you none of this would be possible I am
[01:35:12] very grateful for whatever level you
[01:35:14] participate at and um with that said uh
[01:35:18] we are going to go on to the ask me
[01:35:20] anything question for those of you who
[01:35:21] just like the podcast part we'll see
[01:35:23] next week for those of you who like the
[01:35:25] ask me anything question here we go
[01:35:27] Edgard Abu says first of all thanks for
[01:35:30] the quality information you provide
[01:35:31] every day and week I've been listening
[01:35:33] for two years Chang my way to investing
[01:35:34] I'd like you to have a look at crowd
[01:35:35] strike very niche market getting bitter
[01:35:37] by the day 18% market share recent
[01:35:40] events provideed by opportunity uh we
[01:35:42] cannot quantify how much they're going
[01:35:44] to have to pay out one Airline asked
[01:35:46] them for a half a billion dollar that's
[01:35:48] number one number two a friend actually
[01:35:51] contacted me on this who owned owned it
[01:35:54] and you know he was saying
[01:35:57] that
[01:35:58] [Music]
[01:35:59] um and and you know my first response to
[01:36:03] him was look I don't own stocks like
[01:36:05] that it when when he contacted me it was
[01:36:08] trading at 75 billion now it's at 54
[01:36:12] billion by the way uh but that was after
[01:36:14] the First full it was trading at 75
[01:36:16] billion and I said look you know it was
[01:36:18] trading at 16 times sales that's that's
[01:36:21] not a business I would ever own in a
[01:36:22] million years
[01:36:24] um irrespective of How High the momentum
[01:36:27] goes or anything else so uh you know so
[01:36:30] would I own it at 11 times
[01:36:33] sales uh and the answer is um 11 times
[01:36:38] sales and 40 times earnings what's the
[01:36:41] earnings growth 20 times no I probably
[01:36:43] wouldn't so
[01:36:46] um could it get a bounce you know with
[01:36:50] uh with a tech bounce sure it could but
[01:36:53] I think there's any way to quantify this
[01:36:55] risk so for me it's a it's a
[01:36:58] pass there's down and down for a reason
[01:37:01] uh so that's that Allen hair uh morning
[01:37:05] Tom been listening for a while really
[01:37:06] enjoy the content no in the past you
[01:37:07] mentioned no interest in Ford or GM but
[01:37:09] after Ford's big drop last week has that
[01:37:11] impacted your opinion okay so Ford and
[01:37:14] GM are annuity and healthcare companies
[01:37:18] with a car business attached on the side
[01:37:21] and for that reason I will never own own
[01:37:23] an oem a union-based business because
[01:37:26] you don't control your margins you don't
[01:37:28] control your future and uh and in that
[01:37:31] regard uh sold to you so um Jim Jones
[01:37:36] would you look at Smith and Wesson uh
[01:37:39] I've looked at this thing a million
[01:37:40] times the numbers look great and the
[01:37:42] stock never does anything so I would say
[01:37:45] no but I'll just take one more look at
[01:37:47] it um because it's been a
[01:37:51] while Smith and
[01:37:55] Wesson well let me just type in
[01:38:01] Wesson all right s
[01:38:06] swbi all right so it's training at about
[01:38:09] half off what's happening with the
[01:38:12] business s swbi so I guess these people
[01:38:15] are are asking me because they think
[01:38:17] it's going to do really well if there's
[01:38:18] a change in administration I think it
[01:38:22] doesn't matter because look look the
[01:38:24] last Administration came in here the
[01:38:26] stock collapsed from 2016 to 2020 it
[01:38:29] went from 20 down to
[01:38:31] three um and then under the current
[01:38:34] Administration where you think it would
[01:38:35] do terrible it went from 3 to 35
[01:38:43] so uh all right well there you go um now
[01:38:47] cash flows re accelerating but revenues
[01:38:49] are
[01:38:50] collapsing uh gross margins collapsing I
[01:38:53] I'm going to say say pass that not for
[01:38:54] me I understand why you're looking at it
[01:38:56] maybe it works but I wouldn't be I
[01:38:58] wouldn't be interested Zack tan like
[01:39:01] your opinion on a potential hedge
[01:39:03] between Cooper standard and Advanced
[01:39:05] Auto Parts given the age of vehicles is
[01:39:07] hting 13 and a half do you agree that
[01:39:08] stock movements could complement each
[01:39:10] other when fundamentals either ship
[01:39:14] bullish or bearish for vehicle
[01:39:15] production besides being backed by
[01:39:16] market fundamentals huge oper that are
[01:39:19] being worked on supply chain they're not
[01:39:22] going to hedge each other they're
[01:39:23] they're discret businesses okay the
[01:39:26] people who who won't be able to get in
[01:39:27] new cars uh you know that aren't the 18
[01:39:32] million people is you know 315 million
[01:39:35] other people that have old crappy cars
[01:39:37] that have to fix them so once they fix
[01:39:39] the business uh it's going to make money
[01:39:41] again and um I think they're both great
[01:39:44] so they're not hedging anything don't
[01:39:46] over complicate it they're two discret
[01:39:48] businesses uh can you take a look at
[01:39:50] global payment
[01:39:52] Network and arsal or Mattel Mattel we
[01:39:54] did I'm not interested in that business
[01:39:56] gpn is uh it's too opaque for me because
[01:40:00] you've got Consumer
[01:40:02] Debt that I can't quantify and I don't
[01:40:05] understand what's on off balance sheet
[01:40:07] on balance sheet so uh for me it's
[01:40:10] probably a pass I I understand s swp not
[01:40:16] swpi um gpn is getting cheap but
[01:40:25] te
[01:40:27] operates Merchant settlement funding
[01:40:30] chargeback
[01:40:31] resolution R of software streamline
[01:40:33] businesses I I've got enough payments
[01:40:35] business with the PayPal well I'll just
[01:40:37] focus on that I
[01:40:41] um gpn
[01:41:13] uh let's see
[01:41:17] here I mean look it's a lowquality
[01:41:19] business it's definitely trading towards
[01:41:21] the low end of its range
[01:41:23] I mean if you want to take a little
[01:41:26] risk I I I don't like the business
[01:41:29] enough I'm just going to tell you I
[01:41:31] looked at it in the past I think it
[01:41:32] could certainly Bounce from here and
[01:41:34] keep going I just I just don't love it
[01:41:36] here so I'm going to pass even though it
[01:41:38] does look attractive and I understand
[01:41:40] how you got there um but it's not for me
[01:41:45] Martin florini love to hear your
[01:41:47] thoughts on tbbb it's a Mexican food
[01:41:51] chain I'm going to along the lines of
[01:41:53] Aldi growing Revenue in
[01:41:59] stores uh
[01:42:01] supermarkets are not good businesses
[01:42:05] unless you're
[01:42:07] Walmart
[01:42:09] so I'm probably a
[01:42:13] pass there's there's really not enough
[01:42:16] information for
[01:42:18] me and not enough of an operating
[01:42:20] history for me to get comfortable um I
[01:42:23] generally only invest in public
[01:42:24] companies that have I I mean you'd have
[01:42:26] to pull up the perspectives and see
[01:42:27] their last 20 years of data I I mean I
[01:42:30] understand wanting to get some exposure
[01:42:31] to Mexico uh don't get me
[01:42:33] wrong
[01:42:40] um gross margins mid
[01:42:47] teens free cash flows
[01:42:50] growing revenues are growing
[01:42:59] yeah it it's just not for me I I don't
[01:43:02] think there's anything wrong with it but
[01:43:04] it's not the kind of business that I
[01:43:06] invest in um doesn't mean it won't work
[01:43:09] it certainly could but it's not it's
[01:43:11] going to work without me Adam thoughts
[01:43:13] on whirpool we've covered this one I
[01:43:15] think it's okay I think you're going to
[01:43:16] get the uh cycle back going here
[01:43:19] again um and you get a dividend while
[01:43:22] you wait
[01:43:24] uh I think there was a problem with cash
[01:43:27] flow with this one
[01:43:29] though yeah so it's just starting to re
[01:43:31] accelerate revenues got
[01:43:34] hammered so you just have to you have to
[01:43:36] do your work and understand what's the
[01:43:38] plan to turn it around and if it's a
[01:43:40] plausible plan and who's doing the
[01:43:43] turnaround and if you can get comfort
[01:43:44] with all those things I mean you
[01:43:46] probably have a decent enough margin of
[01:43:48] safety let's see where the uh balance
[01:43:51] sheet is
[01:44:02] billion doll of cash $6.4 billion of
[01:44:04] debt on one and a half billion of cash
[01:44:06] so you definitely want to uh get a sense
[01:44:09] of when all of those are uh
[01:44:12] [Music]
[01:44:13] maturing like in um the case of Canada
[01:44:17] Goose we've got a couple years to 2027
[01:44:20] same as uh Cooper standard so we're
[01:44:22] comfortable there so you got to get
[01:44:24] Comfort on that but all in you should
[01:44:26] probably be able to make this one work
[01:44:28] Adam after you do your work uh longtime
[01:44:32] listener Stefon from
[01:44:34] Canada paycom we've covered that a bunch
[01:44:38] of times and we passed on it all times
[01:44:42] uh I don't have any Edge as to what
[01:44:44] their mode is so for me it's a pass
[01:44:50] um I don't know how they retain
[01:44:55] share but the numbers look definitely
[01:44:59] attractive even though Revenue growth is
[01:45:00] decelerating so then you're going to get
[01:45:02] multiple
[01:45:03] contraction
[01:45:06] um the question is what was the
[01:45:12] multiple
[01:45:19] so five times sales
[01:45:24] 20 times earnings what's the earnings
[01:45:27] cash flow is probably a cash
[01:45:30] machine
[01:45:34] yes Capital yeah I mean look if you can
[01:45:37] get comfort that they're going to
[01:45:39] maintain their moat and what they have
[01:45:41] is impenetrable then yeah I mean it
[01:45:44] looks great on paper
[01:45:47] um but that's that's a big project to
[01:45:50] get comfort that their mode is gonna not
[01:45:52] not erode
[01:45:53] um and I understand why you got there
[01:45:55] and there's probably something to it but
[01:45:57] you know often times when these things
[01:45:59] break they just take a long time so
[01:46:04] um for that reason I'm I'm going to take
[01:46:06] a pass on that one even though it could
[01:46:08] certainly work for you after you do more
[01:46:10] more
[01:46:11] work uh next
[01:46:13] is Sam R what's your opinion on macro
[01:46:17] Legends like Soros dren Miller and macro
[01:46:19] hedge funds in general hard to be
[01:46:21] consistently good and more oneoff
[01:46:23] amazing trade that defines them
[01:46:26] [Music]
[01:46:28] I I think it's just a different way to
[01:46:30] make money I mean there's a ton of ways
[01:46:32] to make money you know you there's not
[01:46:35] one right way so uh in the case of dren
[01:46:38] Miller and Soros which is basically the
[01:46:40] same thing they had a monster trade
[01:46:43] where they shorted the British pound and
[01:46:45] they got lucky with some policy changes
[01:46:48] but
[01:46:50] um you know over time drun and Miller
[01:46:53] has delivered so that it's a different
[01:46:55] style so has Buffett so has the guy at
[01:46:57] Renaissance who does you know high
[01:46:59] frequency trading it's just many
[01:47:02] different ways to make money so uh I've
[01:47:04] got nothing really to say other than uh
[01:47:07] congratulations on an incredible
[01:47:09] long-term track record you know same
[01:47:10] thing I would say to Buffett and uh and
[01:47:13] many others so River
[01:47:15] Rahi uh you just have to know what
[01:47:17] you're good at that that that's really
[01:47:18] what what it comes down to I like the
[01:47:20] time Arbitrage business buy quality
[01:47:22] businesses IGN the short-term noise as
[01:47:24] long as the fundamentals are improving
[01:47:25] eventually the price will catch up use
[01:47:27] low leverage so you can live and to see
[01:47:30] the realization and over time you're
[01:47:32] going to compound some some double and
[01:47:34] triple much faster than you anticipate
[01:47:37] and some take longer but on balance you
[01:47:40] can outperform if you have a great
[01:47:42] framework uh River Rah uh recent
[01:47:45] listener love your podcast change my
[01:47:47] investing strategy sleep better at night
[01:47:48] what do you think of
[01:47:51] akr at Co
[01:47:53] wor
[01:47:56] um a t
[01:48:04] KR where were you at $10 it's at1 130
[01:48:08] let's take a look
[01:48:09] [Music]
[01:48:11] a
[01:48:13] t
[01:48:19] KR cash flows decelerating revenues are
[01:48:22] decel ating margins have stopped
[01:48:26] improving
[01:48:33] um revenues are decelerating I don't
[01:48:36] like that at all
[01:48:41] um still a free cash flow
[01:48:50] machine cheap in terms of multiple
[01:48:54] compounder Capital what do they
[01:49:00] do electrical safety infrastructure
[01:49:02] products and solutions company with
[01:49:05] conduit cables installation
[01:49:07] accessories metal framing medical pipe
[01:49:11] Tu Cable Systems
[01:49:14] Plastics
[01:49:16] um alticore
[01:49:36] um I would just need to
[01:49:40] understand what's the biggest portion
[01:49:42] you know looks I hate when companies
[01:49:45] have a gazillion things in their
[01:49:46] description find out where most of their
[01:49:48] revenues come from and then do Channel
[01:49:50] checks on the competition and figure out
[01:49:52] why
[01:49:53] why they're growing so fast and if their
[01:49:56] moat can be penetrated and if not then
[01:49:59] you probably have a decent stock but
[01:50:00] it's not something that I would be
[01:50:02] involved in um
[01:50:05] despite the numbers doing okay I'm a
[01:50:09] little weary of that Revenue
[01:50:10] deceleration after a 10 bagger move as
[01:50:12] well that concerns me so for that reason
[01:50:14] I would pass and with that said
[01:50:17] congratulations ladies and gentlemen on
[01:50:20] 250 amazing episodes we'll be back next
