The destocking cycle is ending, and a restocking cycle is beginning, which is positive for cyclicals and manufacturing.

| Destocking Cycle | Bottomed and starting to turn up | This is positive for cyclicals and manufacturing. |
| Earnings Growth | Accelerating in un-magnified stocks and small caps, decelerating in Magnificent Seven | This supports the rotation from growth to value. |

- ⚠️ Potential for a hard landing if the Fed doesn't ease soon enough

## Technical Takeaways
The Russell 2000 is turning the corner, indicating a potential outperformance of small caps. Equity sentiment is mid-level, moving towards extreme, but not there yet. September is historically the worst month of the year for the S&P 500, but positive returns are expected after the first Fed cut.
