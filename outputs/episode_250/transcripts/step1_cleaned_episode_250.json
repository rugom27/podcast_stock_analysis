  "cleaned_transcript": "### MISCELLANEOUS\nwelcome to hedge fun tips with Tom Hayes I'm Tom Hayes and this is your 250th podcast video cast for the week ending August 1st 2024 what an exciting month July was August uh off to a rocky start but uh but that's normal in in the first few days of the month and uh couple of exciting things going on that we'll share with you I want to get right down to it first and foremost want to thank my buddy Chris down in Dallas for sending me this new mug he sent me a two mugs at or actually a bunch of mugs when we did the 200th uh episode and this one says this one's white versus black and then there was also uh blue great Hill Capital ones this one says on one side HED fun tips and on the other side opinions not advice see terms so now I could just say that everything go to hedge fun tips see terms thank you so much for thinking of me\n\nwith that said\n\n### MEDIA_APPEARANCE_RECAP\nlet's get to the markets overview we'll do the media and then we're going to get down to a lot of data a lot of earnings uh this is a catchup I mean I know last week wasn't short but it was shorter than normal so first I want to thank Neil Cavuto and jenet D tomases for having me on Fox Business Cavuto Coast to Coast this week and we're going to listen in now other Thomas I want to go to is Thomas Hayes the chairman of managing member of great Hill Capital Thomas you heard the other Thomas and what he was saying about the environment for this we don't need a cut right now but the markets certainly are anticipating not necessarily from today's meeting uh but Alan ler of course the provides the see they made a credible argument for doing that but but that aside um Market rates are very low it's just looking at a 10e in and out of 4.09% maybe you don't need to do anything maybe the markets are doing the the heavy lifting for the FED what do you think well in anticipation of the cut you do have the FED funds rate over so the 10e yield is compressing and in the event that they walked back the cuts you would see that 10year yield shoot right back up the markets would be down so it's a little bit of uh setting I'm sorry but would that apply if they do nothing in other words if they if they do nothing I guess the big issue today is what they signal or Jerome pal signals when he talks to reporters and if he sets the stage for September cut how do the markets deal with that yeah I think that's baked into the markets right now I think the surprise would be if he said maybe September is not on the table the markets would react but you're seeing it look the rotation has begun July was a turning point we saw the dramatic rotation in anticipation of one cut in September and possibly another in December so the market likes that the the market is acting accordingly but what's interesting is Tech and communication Services up to this point for the month of July were negative while Banks were up 16% real estate was up 7% utilities was up 5% so this is kind of baked into the market at present um let's talk technology real quickly Thomas I mean what what what the market taketh away give it back with a vengeance and Microsoft is getting the credit for this even though its numbers uh failed to impress especially its Cloud database and business and all the rest but the fact of the matter was it did indicate it's spending a heck of a lot of money on artificial intelligence and every facet that was deemed along with the AMD news as a sign that you know uh this this AI spending is still strong and it's lifting all the chip makers so how do you interpret that how how long live do you see this play it out for me yeah well Neil we have an AI arms race between Microsoft Google and Amazon and the AI arms dealers are the short-term winners Nvidia uh Intel and AMD but I think that's going to change so like you said Microsoft's capex was up 7 7.6% while their revenues were only up 15% seoa wrote an article about a month ago called the $600 billion question and basically what they said was uh given the amount of capex that these companies are spending on GPU chips they would need another 600 billion and we're back then I want to thank Melanie schaer of ceo.ca it's out of Toronto for doing a long form interview with me that gives you some context as to what's happening under the surface so we'll listen in [Music] now I'm excited to be joined today by Thomas Hayes chairman and managing member great Hill Capital how are you doing today Tom doing great Mel thanks for having me so we're talking during a huge week for the market the US Federal Reserve is meeting as we speak into tomorrow the central bank will announce its decision on interest rates we also have four companies within the Magnificent Seven reporting earnings we'll get into the rotation that you've been calling for for a long time in a minute but what should investors expect to see from these earnings and the guidance that's issued and will the FED cut rates tomorrow the million dooll question will the FED Cut Rate tomorrow well look I think just as important as the fed's decision is more importantly is actually the bank of Japan because we've had this theme Mel where Bank of Japan has been the global liquidity provider with unlimited quantitative easing not only buying jgbs uh and us treasuries but actually buying domestic and Global equities well that that is uh gig is up and they are now in a tightening period they' wanted inflation for many years they now have it and uh all bets are on that they could be raising rates almost as we speak I know their meeting is happening and and we'll know in the next 24 hours so as they start to withdraw that liquidity from Global markets the pressure is on the fed and the ECB to now step in and uh be a global provider of liquidity I know there are some Traders and investors who think tomorrow uh and this week may be a live meeting for the fed the odds don't favorite uh chair Powell other than his autopilot debacle in December of 2018 uh prefers not to shock the market or surprise the market so my sense is uh it's it's going to be February where uh excuse me in September where consensus current currently is that the first cut will be in September uh based on you know Dudley coming out and a couple of others and some of the weakness that we're seeing in the employment stats it wouldn't be unjustified to cut tomorrow but I think they have not done a good job of preparing the market if that was their intention and therefore we think September is going to be the base case for the first cut and December the second cut and what about for the big Tech earnings coming out this week yeah you know the the big thing here seoa put out a great uh white paper a few weeks ago called the $600 billion do question and what they basically said was all the cap backs that we're seeing on AI chips uh and semiconductors uh is is fine except for the fact that it would require $600 billion of new Revenue to justify the cost and they break down SAS margins and uh Etc and what we saw with alphabet was a concerning Trend where the capex was was very high and the revenues were not yet nearly supportive to justify that capex and you've effectively had an arms race with all of big big Tech trying to hoard as many high-end chips as they possibly could as quickly as they could so that their competition didn't have it but there the revenues that support that level of spend are nowhere to be found so there's a there's a fear about margins there's a fear about how long will it take if ever to fill that $600 billion Revenue hole commencer it with the capex bend that we've seen uh and the front loading of the the chip hoarding so you know I think that big Tech and magn 7 have come in a reasonable amount but it wouldn't surprise me look I would say this it would surprise me if this was another 2000 Tech wre I don't see that coming because these are huge free cash flow generators which was not the case in 2000 so I wouldn't compare it to that uh but I think prospectively certainly for the next 9 to 18 months we should see a scenario where irrespective of tomorrow's earnings or or the day after's earnings where the mag magnificent 7 as a basket underperforms the unmagnify I.E the second half of the year we should see more subdued General indices because of the weights of magnificent 7 within the market cap weight indices and uh huge monstrous opportunities under the surface for the Left Behind stocks I mean you saw a couple today that we've talked a lot about on our podcast and and in public uh TV appearances you know PayPal is up uh seven eight percent today on beating earnings Stanley Black and Decker talk about old world uh is up seven or eight% on beating earnings so there's a lot of great stuff happening under the surface that gets no\n\n### MISCELLANEOUS\nthat would require $600 billion of new Revenue to justify the cost and they break down SAS margins and uh Etc and what we saw with alphabet was a concerning Trend where the capex was was very high and the revenues were not yet nearly supportive to justify that capex and you've

appearances you know PayPal is up uh seven eight percent today on beating earnings Stanley Black and Decker talk about old world uh is up seven or eight% on beating earnings so there's a lot of great stuff happening under the surface that gets no\n### MISCELLANEOUS\nheadlines  while everyone's overcrowded into the mag 7 that the air is leaking out of that balloon I don't I wouldn't say it's going to pop or anything like that I would just say it's it's going to be much more subdued for the near term yeah so you've been calling for a rotation out of the mag s and big Tech into small caps even though as you said there's been a lot of skepticism around that idea now we see that shift appears to have started can you walk us through your thesis and what you see happening into the end of the year and even into next year I know on your podcast you referred to 2025 as the year of the small caps yeah yeah I think well I I think we've started in 2024 and and we'll see more of that in in the second half of 2024 and that should continue into 2025 as a matter of fact historically since World War II small caps outperform large caps by about 11% in the first 12 months after the first cut so if if our base case is correct in September is the first cut that would imply a meaningful outperformance uh again for you know another 14 16 18 months the first part of that easing cycle and and I think that's going to be positive but you know a lot of people are skeptical that you know there have been several fake outs Etc and I think what's different this time is the earnings composition has dramatically changed so we started the year with enormous earnings growth for the Magnificent Seven with the first quarter alone they had 50% earnings growth -0 and the unmagnify had negative 1% so it's it's no wonder that they dramatically uh underperformed the 493 and the mag 7 dramatically outperformed the earnings growth was there well that composition is changing it's expected by the fourth quarter that the unmagnify will have 19% earnings growth and the Magnificent 7 will have 177% earnings growth which is why I say they'll be fine they're just in our view going to underperform because they're decelerating in earnings growth versus the rest of the market is accelerating and then as far as supporting the underlying thesis in small caps in addition to cyclicals and and the unmagnify 493 the earnings growth this year is about 4% uh and next year it's expected to be 177% whereas large caps are going to be 14% earnings growth next year and their 12% this year so uh it's not a hope or a wish uh the only thing that could change that thesis would be a dramatic change in earnings expectations for small caps versus large caps caps and so far we're not seeing that so far it's actually right on schedule and uh and we're going to see more of that I I think in the last few days or so where you saw little hiccup when kamla was announced as the candidate you saw teex start to take off and uh the unmagnify uh take a little rest but I think that was also a function of they mooved so far so fast I think it was something like 133% in a week and a half small caps as a basket moved it was just an excuse to rest so irrespective of the president uh who's elected Etc I think this this trend is going to persist because the composition and the cost of capital cycle supports it well the Russell 2000 is up about 11% since the second quarter ended now how should investors be positioning themselves for a longer term shift and what data should they be paying particular attention to yeah I think a couple of things are are going going to take place number one the UNM magnificent 493 so there will be large caps that do extremely well that have lagged the non non magnificent 7 then you've got anything interest rate sensitive so dividend Growers Stanley Black and& Decker is a great example of that um cyclicals REITs are another one that have been left for dead they're the most under owned since 2009 everyone's calling for commercial real estate uh apocalypse we think there t\n\n earnings growth next year and their 12% this year so uh it's not a hope or a wish uh the only thing that could change that thesis would be a dramatic change in earnings expectations for small caps versus large caps caps and so far we're not seeing that so far it's actually right on schedule and uh and we're going to see more of that I I think in the last few days or so where you saw little hiccup when kamla was announced as the candidate you saw teex start to take off and uh the unmagnify uh take a little rest but I think that was also a function of they mooved so far so fast I think it was something like 133% in a week and a half small caps as a basket moved it was just an excuse to rest so irrespective of the president uh who's elected Etc I think this this trend is going to persist because the composition and the cost of capital cycle supports it well the Russell 2000 is up about 11% since the second quarter ended now how should investors be positioning themselves for a longer term shift and what data should they be paying particular attention to yeah I think a couple of things are are going going to take place number one the UNM magnificent 493 so there will be large caps that do extremely well that have lagged the non non magnificent 7 then you've got anything interest rate sensitive so dividend Growers Stanley Black and& Decker is a great example of that um cyclicals REITs are another one that have been left for dead they're the most under owned since 2009 everyone's calling for commercial real estate uh apocalypse we think there t### FEATURED_COMPANY_DEEP_DIVES\nhere is  some truth to that but it's Mo mostly going to be in the B and C Properties this is analogous analogous to the mall uh debacle you know four or five years ago where the a malls wound up doing better you know the the Simon properties of the world that have Lululemon and Apple Stores and all the things that people want to go to and then the BNC malls that were anchored by JC Penney and Sears uh had been a train wreck I I think this it will be similar for commercial office uh I think there's a little bit of froth in the multifam uh in in certain areas in the country we'll see some of that but I think it'll be a slow motion unwind and lenders incentivized to extend and pretend so it won't be an acute abrupt type of uh pop it will be more of a slow leakage uh that can be contained and the rest of the market can pick up the slack the other thing that's happening in the same at the same time Mel that few people are focused on is we have been in a dramatic recession for the last two years it's just been contained well it started with the two quarters of negative GDP growth uh and and uh in 2002 first quarter second quarter uh and it was supported by a massive manufacturing slowdown the destocking cycle that has now bottomed and is starting to turn up we're starting to see more positive signs slowly green shoots where manufacturing is coming back and we're certainly seeing very green Shoots for the destocking cycle being in the rear view mirror and the restocking cycle just starting and that's not the time that you hit tops in markets or ends of Cycles that's more the time when you hit second legs uh and refreshes a cycle and that's what we're starting to see right now as evidenced in uh Stanley Black and Decker is a great example of that this morning they they spent eight quarters destocking and now they're restocking their free cash flows going through the roof uh they paid down a bunch of debt they've taken the costs out and we're seeing that among all many of the the unmagnify can you give us a rundown of three stocks that you're bullish on into the end of the year yeah I can I can do that for sure I I we love PayPal we've lik that for a while it's been dead money for a number of months uh but I think today was the Breakthrough quarter uh we saw earn we saw the revenues were up 8% their earnings were up 177% their payment volume was up 11% their free cash flow for the quarter was 1.4 billion I mean how many turnaround quote unquote turnaround situations do you see that they're generating six6 billion dollars of cash per year and you can't give the stock away so uh uh and their margins are coming back so they they not only took guidance up they said by the way we're not going to do five billion of free cash flow we're going to do six billion of free cash flow oh and by the way uh remember how we said we're going to buy back $5 billion worth of stock this year yeah we changed our mind we're going to buy back $ billion worth of stock this year so Alex Chris who came from into it he ran the small business division which was responsible for 50% of the revenues of a of a stock that went up you know 20s something times during his tenure 20x plus uh has taken the Reigns of PayPal and he laid out his plan earlier this year it fell flat but he's executing and we saw that and we're seeing the the movement in the stock price today and we believe it's just the beginning of many good things to come uh on PayPal and then uh Stanley Black and Decker as I said they sold a non-core business paid down $1.2 billion of debt their their cost reduction plan to cut $2 billion doll of costs by the end of 2025 is almost 75% done they've taken nearly $1.5 billion of cost out of the business the business is inflection they inflecting they have uh DeWalt they have Craftsman they have Stanley they have black and& Decker so if you believe in construction and you believe in manufacturing and you believe there's going to be an increased demand for tools and you believe in the housing shortage and you believe that uh that the Millennials are going to continue housing formation for the next five years you want to own Stanley Black and& Decker or at least we own it you should do whatever you want to do uh opinion not advice then you know we like you know as you can tell we like durable businesses that are temporarily out of favor we like Disney okay you can't give Disney stock away they just had their greatest box office of a R-rated movie in history uh with Deadpool and Wolverine I I didn't get a chance to see it but uh I guess I'll have to now as an owner of the business and uh and we look at the sum of the parts and what's what's fascinating about Disney there's so much pessimism and noise around Disney but if you do the sum of the parts the parks and the experiences and the consumer products do about 10 billion of eida it's probably a little bit more now so that's worth about $80 a share okay as of a couple of days ago the stock was trading around $9 a share it's bumped up a little bit since the weekend still incredibly cheap what that means is effectively the market is assigning zero value to Disney plus which has 100 53 million subscriptions uh ESPN which is the number one sports property in the world and currently gaining share not losing share you've got Hulu you've got the T TV networks and you have the movie theatrical releases like we saw this weekend and we saw with inside out to which was a huge success uh that's that's going to be another multi-billion dollar Blockbuster and the market is currently assigning for all of those those pieces of the business mail you're the market is assigning zero do of value those business on a normalized run rate are going to do 15 billion of ebit We Believe which implies that the stock could over the next three to five years in our in our opinion could uh be $180 to $200 stock so basically a double uh over a few years as the market starts to recognize that and that's not like wish or hope if you look at Netflix it's got 270 some odd million uh users and they get about a quarter of a billion dollars worth of value attributed to to the value of those uh subscribers so even if you say well Disney are only worth half as much there's a hundred some odd billion dollars that's not not yet priced into the stock we think there's tremendous opportunity and then\n\nokay you can't give Disney stock away they just had their greatest box office of a R-rated movie in history uh with Deadpool and Wolverine I I didn't get a chance to see it but uh I guess I'll have to now as an owner of the business and uh and we look at the sum of the parts and what's what's fascinating about Disney there's so much pessimism and noise around Disney but if you do the sum of the parts the parks and the experiences and the consumer products do about 10 billion of eida it's probably a little bit more now so that's worth about $80 a share okay as of a couple of days ago the stock was trading around $9 a share it's bumped up a little bit since the weekend still incredibly cheap what that means is effectively the market is assigning zero value to Disney plus which has 100 53 million subscriptions uh ESPN which is the number one sports property in the world and currently gaining share not losing share you've got Hulu you've got the T TV networks and you have the movie theatrical releases like we saw this weekend and we saw with inside out to which was a huge success uh that's that's going to be another multi-billion dollar Blockbuster and the market is currently assigning for all of those those pieces of the business mail you're the market is assigning zero do of value those business on a normalized run rate are going to do 15 billion of ebit We Believe which implies that the stock could over the next three to five years in our in our opinion could uh be $180 to $200 stock so basically a double uh over a few years as the market starts to recognize that and that's not like wish or hope if you look at Netflix it's got 270 some odd million uh users and they get about a quarter of a billion dollars worth of value attributed to to the value of those uh subscribers so even if you say well Disney are only worth half as much there's a hundred some odd billion dollars that's not not yet priced into the stock we think there's tremendous opportunity and then\n### FEATURED_COMPANY_DEEP_DIVES\nfinally  is a boring business called gxo Logistics this is one of Brad Jacobs companies and Brad Jacobs has the mightest touch he's done uh if you had invested a million with him when he he got involved with United Rentals you would have made 47 times your money over a number of years if you had gotten involved with xbo Logistics in 2010 when he got involved you would have made 31 times your money so a million becomes 31 million and gxo Logistics was spun out of xbo they do Outsource Logistics supply chain uh reverse Logistics uh order fulfillment Etc and uh they have guided that they're going to nearly double A adjusted iida by 2027 which implies you could get nearly a double in the stock except for the fact that when your growth rate accelerates as it will with these uh assimilations of some recent acquisitions that they've done not only do you get the the doubling in terms of uh stock price you get some multiple expansion as they start growing and continue to grow Top Line and bottom line by double digits the market will pay a premium for growth and that's why we think this this one as well could be double double plus over the next handful of years uh and a huge track record of success and a huge total addressable Market of 430 billion which they've only got about 5% they're the second largest player basically a duopoly with DHL and a fragmented business and uh and huge huge open space for them to grow and lastly Tom um just because we're running out of time and I know this isn't your favorite thing to talk about but as the US election cycle continues to heat up can you tell us what the stock market wants to see in terms of who ends up in the White House and which party or parties take control of the house and the Senate yeah that's a fair question look I I think at the end of the day uh empirically speaking what's worked historically is when no party controls all three branches so the worst case scenario would be if you have either uh all Democratic executive Senate and House or an all Republican executive Senate and House that's bad for the stock market bad meaning it will perform less well than when you have a situation of gridlock where one party controls at least one of those three branches and that's effectively what we want to see whether you're on the right side of of of the spectrum or the left side what you should be hopeful for is that your party does not win all three branches if you own stocks because what works best is gridlock the market likes when politicians are limited in their ability to get stuff done because the more they do the worse it tends to get so we'll leave it at that and uh and let's hope for gridlock and and whomever uh you hope uh gains the executive branch uh just just be hopeful that uh they're checked in Congress it's definitely going to be interesting there's lots to watch over the uh days and weeks ahead yeah again Thomas Hayes chairman and managing member great Hill Capital thanks again for joining us Tom thanks m [Music] [Applause] and we're back and then\n\num for growth and that's why we think this this one as well could be double double plus over the next handful of years uh and a huge track record of success and a huge total addressable Market of 430 billion which they've only got about 5% they're the second largest player basically a duopoly with DHL and a fragmented business and uh and huge huge open space for them to grow and lastly Tom um just because we're running out of time and I know this isn't your favorite thing to talk about but

just just be hopeful that uh they're checked in Congress it's definitely going to be interesting there's lots to watch over the uh days and weeks ahead yeah again Thomas Hayes chairman and managing member great Hill Capital thanks again for joining us Tom thanks m ### MEDIA_APPEARANCE_RECAP\nfinally  I want to thank uh Sean calebs and Ryan Gallagher uh for having me on cgtn America last night to talk about the fed's uh developments we'll listen in now well what the FED does or doesn't do is always big news for talk more about this latest decision on interest rates and what it's going to mean for the US economy moving forward let's bring in Thomas Hayes Thomas is of course the founder and chairman and managing member of great Hill Capital LLC uh a long short Equity manager based in New York City Thomas always a pleasure great to have you back thanks for having me Sean okay let's dissect what Jerome pal had to say uh really no surprise as our John ter just told us that there wasn't a drop in interest rates today but your thoughts on the language that he used about a potential cut in September saying it will be on the table so do markets build in that they're expecting this cut and then if it does or doesn't happen what are we looking for the next eight weeks well Sean I think the market is already built it in uh fed funds Futures had been pricing nearly 100% chance of the first cut in September and what we saw in the month of July was that the great rotation in anticipation of that began in Earnest as a matter of fact if you look at as of this morning you had Tech and Communications services for the month of July were nearly flat were a little bit negative might have closed barely positive but Banks were up 16% on the month real estate was up 6.9% utilities was up 5% uh equal weighted uh S&P was up 5% whereas the cap weighted the normal S&P 500 was only up about 1% uh maybe a little bit more at the close and then small caps were up 10 10% so the market has already started to get ahead of this and the language as you stated Sean did in fact change to be more predictive that he is moving ahead as a matter of fact there were a few fed members he he alluded to that wanted to go in July wow okay so to talk more about what happened what areas of the economy is the US winning uh the fight against inflation in because that obviously is going to be first second third fourth fifth on the list uh leading them to make that decision one way or the other well we're seeing disinflation so we saw McDonald's for example had uh sales down 1% the big two things that have been holding up inflation were auto insurance and auto prices which have started to come down and owners equivalent rent which has been on a lagged basis which has also started to show some signs of weakness uh wages grew at just 0.8% in the second quarter so that was the softest since 2020 so everything is showing signs of disinflation but he did emphasize the Dual mandate and he started to make the case again that he was focusing just as much on inflation as now he is focused on employment he doesn't want to see material cracks in or weakening in the labor market which he's focused on like a hawk which uh you know just a month or two months ago he was only focused on inflation so this is a key turning point and he's seeing what the Market's seeing and that is he's going to have to move uh pretty quickly certainly in September as a matter of fact city was out today saying they start in September and they go all the way down to 3 and a half% which would be you know four or five consecutive Cuts in a row wow that'd be interesting now also uh we've heard the FED talk about it's important to not act too soon but you certainly don't want to act too late which is what you're talking about right now so if the economy is moving moving closer to its 2% inflation Target uh but there's still no question that consumers are feeling the bite you talked about some but people still grousing obviously about grocery prices housing uh talk about some of the problem areas and the frustration that people deal with day in and day out yeah there's no question I mean the real issue is incomes have actually risen slightly faster than overall inflation but it hurts people at the lower end because inflation is taxation without representation is basically what it comes down to it hits everyone and it hits people with the lowest discretionary income the hardest people that have to pay for regular Necessities food gasoline Etc on a daily basis rent on a daily basis uh and those prices unfortunately are not going back to pre-pandemic levels the best we can hope for is that they go down to increasing by 2% a year which is the goal but the FED has indicated they have to move before that Target is hit otherwise you run the risk of deflation and you know the key thing\n\noftest since 2020 so everything is showing signs of disinflation but he did emphasize the Dual mandate and he started to make the case again that he was focusing just as much on inflation as now he is focused on employment he doesn't want to see material cracks in or weakening in the labor market which he's focused on like a hawk which uh you know just a month or two months ago he was only focused on inflation so this is a key turning point and he's seeing what the Market's seeing and that is he's going to have to move uh pretty quickly certainly in September as a matter of fact city was out today saying they start in September and they go all the way down to 3 and a half% which would be you know four or five consecutive Cuts in a row wow that'd be interesting now also uh we've heard the FED talk about it's important to not act too soon but you certainly don't want to act too late which is what you're talking about right now so if the economy is moving moving closer to its 2% inflation Target uh but there's still no question that consumers are feeling the bite you talked about some but people still grousing obviously about grocery prices housing uh talk about some of the problem areas and the frustration that people deal with day in and day out yeah there's no question I mean the real issue is incomes have actually risen slightly faster than overall inflation but it hurts people at the lower end because inflation is taxation without representation is basically what it comes down to it hits everyone and it hits people with the lowest discretionary income the hardest people that have to pay for regular Necessities food gasoline Etc on a daily basis rent on a daily basis uh and those prices unfortunately are not going back to pre-pandemic levels the best we can hope for is that they go down to increasing by 2% a year which is the goal but the FED has indicated they have to move before that Target is hit otherwise you run the risk of deflation and you know the key thing### MISCELLANEOUS\nhere is  it's it's binary if they move too quickly they have a quick tool to bring it back in uh they can they can start hiking again but if they move too slowly and disinflation turns into deflation that can be extremely costly and hurt a lot of people you know the the saying is most people would rather pay an extra dollar for a gallon of milk and still have a job than have no job and he's focused on in on that right now and that's what's causing him to move in September yeah quickly those of with retirement accounts they've had a pretty good year Market's doing well uh now if there's a cut in September and another at the uh end of the year tell us what you believe is going to happen to the markets and if that doesn't happen what's going to happen to the markets well I think you shouldn't think about a retirement account in a quarterly basis you should think of it in years uh however it would be natural to see some short-term volatility ahead of the election which is you know late September early October and that just happens to line up with the FED meeting on the 17th 18 so coincident or causal it wouldn't surprise me if we see some continued strength uh over the next few weeks and then some some fall volatility uh along the lines of the election and or the FED meeting in September it could be and a lot of people are pointing to it could be a shortterm sell the news before a year-end uh rally that would not in fact surprise me at all but I but I wouldn't stay short too long because I think think after you get the certainty around the election regardless of who is elected you're going to see a rally into year end as the market absorbs all the new news so what we like to do over here at Great Hill capital is buy high quality companies when they're on sale and hold on to them for a while excellent advice excellent advice Thomas hay is always a pleasure thank you so much for your Insight thank you Sean and we're back and then\n\n### MEDIA_APPEARANCE_RECAP\nMarket's doing well uh now if there's a cut in

is you know to gun laak's point if you're going to say that you're going in September just go just go now like what's the difference of seven or eight weeks um the key thing that's happening under the surface that no one's really talking about in the US aggressively is that Japan has been a Global liquidity provider for 2 years while the rest of the world was tightening and now they've moved abruptly into being a liquidity extractor by tightening and starting to discontinue their quantitative easing and what is a seamless transition would be if the FED started easing at the same time that

expected you saw the Nik was down 3% overnight and then we opened up strong which made little sense um so let's just see my guess is you're going to see more fed liquidity provisioning in the repurchases of balance sheet rolloff so they'll probably ramp that up for the next 6 weeks until they can\n\nUK manufacturing recovering that's good for gxo uh UK business activity picks up after

US dollar that was key to get the hot money flows that came from China to Japan and India everyone thought those were fundamentally based we disagree um uh and as the Yen strengthens we'll see if those hot money flows flow back into China when it happens it happens all at once we got a taste of that with cyclicals and small caps and banks in the month of July they all just went up all at the

uh they're starting to see some light at the end of the tunnel the other thing that was interesting there were two semiconductor companies I'm trying to remember if it was Qualcomm or nxpi who had like 87% year-on-year growth in semiconductor demand for Autos which is a nice look through for Cooper standard we'll see there was a plant shut down uh in June so you know we time will tell we'll see what the earnings tell us um Texas inum Instruments momentum across all markets United Rentals showing particular strength in manufacturing that's been a key part of our thesis there's been some mixed numbers but I think on balance it's recovering out of a 2-year recession uh Canadian Railways is moving right uh they're they're seeing let's see North America production trending slightly positive um Tesla people are underestimating this demand for grid storage probably by orders of magnitude which helps gener and we saw that uh okay alphabet the risk of underinvestigated the amount that they've been spending hoarding semiconductors uh would have to generate 600 billion of new Revenue in order to maintain margins so what you saw with Microsoft 77% growth in capex and a 15% growth in Revenue means their margins are going to go to hell in the short term which is why this rotation is going to be sustained and you're seeing decelerating earnings growth in uh big Tech and accelerating earnings growth in the unmagnify and small caps um Royal Caribbean robust booking and pricing uh earnings estimates are up 1% since July 1st so so that's a positive thing with um S&P up in aggregate the only group that's down is energy which is kind of interesting uh when you consider the data that just came out we used the most amount of natural gas for energy than we've ever used in history last month so that's positive financials are are the biggest part of the upward revisions we did take some City and Bank of America off in the last week or so um to lock in profits those have been big movers for us and um maybe we can redeploy at lower levels we'll see how that works out but sometimes you got to ring the register uh mentions of weak demand are also and Buffett you saw Buffett out there selling a ton of Bank of America I I don't really pay much attention to that anymore but it's been such aggressive selling uh that it was noted especially when you know they were overbought trading at a premium to book all the things that are the opposite of why I buy but I do want to get back into those because I don't think the banking cycle has even begun yet and um and we've got some still but um less than we did and and booked a nice profit on that if you look at the City chart it was uh a big one for us so okay\n\n### MISCELLANEOUS\nTesla people are underestimating this demand

profit on that if you look at the City chart it was uh a big one for us so okay moving along  mentions of weak demand remain elevated but are rolling over this is what you see after Bottoms like 2009 to 2010 and mid 2000 to two 2020 to 2021 so that that rolling over same as midcycle 2012 and 13 so that's positive uh first EPS growth quarter for the other 493 we've talked about this this is the updated number numbers and what you're basically seeing\n\nmentions of weak demand remain elevated but are rolling over this is what you see after Bottoms like 2009 to 2010 and mid 2000 to two 2020 to 2021 so that that rolling over same as midcycle 2012 and 13 so that's positive uh first EPS growth quarter for the other 493 we've talked about this this is the updated number numbers and what you're basically seeing\nhere is  Q3 mag 78 18% earnings growth but X mag 7 is 5% earnings growth um excuse me h Q2 okay yeah Q2 so this is the one we're seeing right now uh 30% was mag 7 7% was uh the other 493 but what you see here in first quarter of 2023 you had negative for for the 493 negative 1% then Q2 -7% then 0% growth for three quarter so this is the first inflecting quarter for the 493 and that's why you're see starting to see them uh uh tick up and you're going to see them continue to accelerate into Q4 to low double digits and sustain that for uh all the way through uh end of 2025 which is a big deal whereas the mag 7 which started the year at 53% earnings growth are going to decelerate all the way down to High teen still doing good numbers but that changes the multiple profile for some of these stocks especially when margins will uh compress from all the capex and Chip hoarding Q2 is expected okay we did that and that destocking cycle is coming to an end this has been our Core theme to The restocking cycle this is back to the uh midline here this is what you saw in 2010 at the beginning of the cycle in 2001 and two in the beginning of the cycle for multi- years that's very very positive that's why you're seeing Stanley Black and deck or 3M having its biggest one day move in history uh that one was a long time coming and but when it comes it comes all at once uh new orders inventory is ticking up so that's positive decade of underinvestment stuff is old private nonresidential fixed assets and structures um so there's a catch-up trade for cap capex manufacturing capacity starting to grow after 10 years of stagnation that's the onshoring theme earnings estimates we cover that risk reward still favorable to cyclicals this is the S&P 500 versus Russell 2000 relative valuations um large is expensive small is cheap the historical mean is significantly above here and it you can't get anywhere near this low until you go all the way back to when 2001 and small caps had a monster historic Rally from 2001 to 2007 ### TECHNICAL_CHARTS\npositioning across sector groups you're still uh with the Z scores dramatically overweight magnificent s which is why you continue to see that refresh you know um Nvidia got down almost below 100 if you remember we put out the next pain trade article it was 100 got up to 139 that day uh so it's down it's already done it uh it looks like you could get a counter Trend move in some of these tech stocks that have fallen a long way will keep an eye on it but um I think the trend is the rotation is going to stay intact so even if they bounce a bit I think they continue to underperform perform for the next 6 to 12 months while the rest of the market starts to outperform if you look at the positioning of Mega cap growth in Tech it's still extreme here um Equity positioning across sectors we covered that then you got the Russell 2000 to S&P 500 look how this thing turned the corner overnight uh when it comes it comes all at once so you can see that visually and for those those of you listening I you know if you listen that's fantastic if you watch it you will get more value because you can see things that you know I'm just a data person so I like to look at it but look listening is better than not you know not doing anything uh in terms of getting information you can see the equity sentiment was unchanged in in June it's kind of midlevel moving towards extreme but not anywhere near there yet Wake Me Up When September Ends annualized S&P price return by month so July is a great month and that was clear uh with a uh average 22% annualized so if you take it times 12 for those of you who don't aren't familiar with these terms uh August is not that bad it's more like June which can be choppy but tends to be okay September is kind of the worst month of the year so I think if we get continued strength for the next few weeks\n\nEquity positioning across sectors we covered that then you got

strength for the next few weeks um there's also some stats I think I have the chart in here where after the first cut the first month is weak but then you get 3 months and 6 months 12 months it's all good good so that kind of lines up the 17th and 18th maybe we get would be nice to see strength into that if we could get strength into early September that's when we could start to get defensive and maybe put on some tactical shorts ahead of the election ### MISCELLANEOUS\nand then be positioned and create some extra free cash to ride the year-end postelection rally uh similar to uh 2016 for those of you were who were around only 5% of firms uh currently use AI suggesting limited growth I don't know if I agree with that second part of the statement but I think there is  an overstatement as to the current value uh dividends likely to contribute more than during the past decade so in the past decade dividend return was 16% of Total return price return was 84 but if you go back to 19 36 through now uh dividends represented a third of the returns about 36% of the Returns versus price 64 which is in line with the 493 outperforming because most of them are dividend stocks and you see in our portfolio we have a lot of dividend stocks that have started to do exceptionally well so look at this moving forward China bond yields at all-time lows they're starting to defend this as we said watch this as an indicator for equities to start to turn that 26 to 2018 move 29 to 2011 this needs to turn it will all turn at once this is this is an extreme like we saw in 2020 and you got a monster rally into 2021 as well every time uh we expect another owner's equivalent rent in July fine that's great uh Dallas fed manufacturing this this is where you see the mixed stuff regionally uh excess covid related money has waned inflation should maintain its downward Trend Dallas fed manufacturing expected new orders so current new orders were not good expected new orders are looking really really good this is really coming out of a trough here so it's good to see uh little delinquency rate moving up in credit cards at the lower end of the consumer something to keep an eye on um um so noted and I'm sure the FED is looking at you know we hope the FED is looking at that as well but it's historically low even though it's rising share of households planning to move over the over the next 12 months has increased recently so with expectations of rates coming down I think people are\n\ndividends likely to contribute more than during the past decade so in the past decade dividend return was 16% of Total return price return was 84 but if you go back to 19 36 through now uh dividends represented a third of the returns about 36% of the Returns versus price 64 which is in line

credit cards at the lower end of the consumer something to keep an eye on\n\n### MACRO_DATA_SLIDES\nJapanese Yen leverage funds so that was at the extreme China's government bond yield we covered that this is the Bloomberg economic surprise index in purple relative to the S&P 500 so this is starting to turn back up which is what we want to see uh the market came in a little bit to follow that but the market meaning the mag 7 in the capway did everything else went up uh here we have the kbe bank index had a Monster Month by the way up Regional Banks were up 18.3% last month which is unbelievable the basket not just one stock that had a good run the basket which means somewhere up 40% declining share of Americans say they're likely to consider buying an electric car uh weekly CL flows by client and sector so they were starting to flow out of tech\n\n### MACRO_DATA_SLIDES\nfinally move uh Japanese Yen leverage funds so that was at the extreme China's government bond yield we covered that this is the Bloomberg economic surprise index in purple relative to the S&P 500 so this is starting to turn back up which is what we want to see uh the market came in a little bit to follow that but the market meaning the mag 7 in the capway did everything else went up uh here we have the kbe bank index had a Monster Month by the way up Regional Banks were up 18.3% last month which is unbelievable the basket not just one stock that had a good run the basket which means somewhere up 40% declining share of Americans say they're likely to consider buying an electric car uh weekly CL flows by client and sector so they were starting to flow out of tech finally\n\n### MEDIA_APPEARANCE_RECAP\nfinally\n\ntoday's largest seven are cheaper and of higher quality than 2,000 we've covered that in the past that's from NED Davis research uh showing us that we're not going to have another 90% down NASDAQ everyone pointing to the Cisco chart it's nothing like that because these do have earnings power they're decelerating earnings power but huge free cash flow and they'll get to a multiple attractive enough that bids will come in unless they dramatically overspend then they'll come down more uh this is job openings uh jolt has D dropped all the way back down to pre pandemic levels job quitting Falls to nearly fouryear low and job openings dip in sign labor market is cooling uh here's the quit rate collaps Bank of Japan raises Benchmark interest rate outlines road map for trimming Bond buying program so this all happened in the last week we said it was coming it's coming now it's here and that's caused a liquidity shock that we have to keep an eye on but I think the FED will use its other facilities to bridge time over the next six weeks and actually be in the market repurchasing rolloff Securities in size uh to keep the liquidity flowing until they actually do the cut here's the 2-year government bond yield starting to rip higher this year uh dollar Yen recovered 10year government bond yield I think broke below 4% today so that is remember we said 3.75% before 5% when everyone when it was at 490 and everyone was saying it was going back to five we said nope it's going to 375 before it goes to 5 and it's collapsed in that regard TLT is up big time real estate is biggest source of distressed bonds and Loans so everything else is looking good    this is really in the scheme of things 194 billion is is uh chicken feed relative to the overall Market you know $ 1220 trillion doll of assets delinquency rate of cmbs loans there's going to be a pony in the pile here for someone that gets this right but uh I think it's a little early foreclosures on the rise uh value of C's commercial properties again commercial capex growth slowed in 2018 19 amid trade War it's starting to pick pick up again    we covered the decelerating earnings of the mag7 momentum tilt is well above average this is starting to roll over so if you're in all the momo stocks get ready for some more pain if you Haven an experienced enough in Q in uh July this is the sler stuff uh from yesterday looked like Russell's trying to bottom here nasdaq's trying to bottom today check back my sense is um we probably get a bounce from here a lot of these tech stocks look oversold but we we'll see  um just Instinct and it feels like this Market wants to hold up for another four to four four to six weeks into the next fed meeting and then sell the news but    that's not how we make our money anyway it really doesn't impact how many generators are going to be sold how many DeWalt uh uh TRS are uh Stanley TRS and DeWalt jackhammers are going to be sold uh and drill bits and everything else so we don't really worry about the day-to-day but we like to keep an eye on everything 10year yield yeah that broke this down trend line so that's good to see all of the stuff lining up for what we want to see in our portfolio and have started to see aggressively in the last four weeks Banks exposure is still one standard deviation below average so we're going to want to get involved again or or rebuild that position you know you city was a big move pulls back we can add add back uh like we've done with other stocks before uh beta C cyclical bullish exposure is near all-time lows    this is what we want to take advantage of and uh dividend yield is starting to move up we were talking about it for months when it was all the way down here now it's starting to come in as we anticipated hedge fund positioning uh long positions through their estimating short positions Bas total short interest exposure to cyclical versus defensive sectors is at an all-time low so this is why when when hedge funds get this extreme against cyclical that's usually when you get the the move because they're caught off sides and they're the ones that chase uh discretionary is most shorted sector financials is the least shorted which is why it's kind of makes sense to uh shortterm having uh taken a some profits there in the short term uh highest net relative exposure to utilities lowest to energy if you remember we were pounding the tables on utilities a year ago they've had a Monster Run uh and now uh they can't get enough of them they'll probably continue to do well over time I haven't looked at let me just take a look at xlu here real quick but the fact that hedge funds are getting excited and crowding in probably tells me that it's time to take a little bit of a break    and then they hate energy so energy sold off those those will probably start to move uh sooner than we anticipate performance of the Russell 1,000 versus value versus growth uh from starting forward PE spreads 1995 to 2019 so effectively in June 2024 we were at the 95th th percentile of growth over value and from that time period what you see is a dramatic outperformance of value as a matter of fact value outperformed growth by 7% in the month of June alone value was up some 5% growth was down some 2% uh so that was a one of the widest spreads then you see here value outperforms you you haven't seen value cheap relative to growth since 1937 and then next 30 years it was all value uh so    so this is setting up and that's also in line with more of the returns coming from dividends uh and    rates coming down and all of the things that go along with that and people are going to want to see cash flow and Tech margins coming down because they're going to do all this investment in AI    here's a note from J they took the price Target up to 175 from 145 opinion follows Trend    initial jobless claims these are the things that guarantee a cut in September this is Jeremy signal on Liz Clayman show by the way I will be on Fox Business the Clayman countdown live in studio with Liz Clayman tomorrow at 3 P.M very excited about that so tune in if you're free but seagull was on today saying uh 50 basis points is is not off the table in September meaning they might have to play catchup bring out magnificent 7 to decelerated rest is expected to improve so that's a newer chart manufacturing PMI was weak this month so we got to keep an eye on that but there's some seasonality around that it was also weak uh mid last year as well continuing jobless claims really starting to spike up highest since November 27th 2021 initial jobless claims uh highest going all the way back to September    and then more than 50% of 74 us CPI components are running below 2% for 3 months now so uh that's a big deal this is from fun Strat via Seth golden get your small caps uh what he's saying is that small caps early signal early cycle in 11 of 12 trading sessions the Russell 2000 traded plusus 1% only occurred 10 times since 1979 outside of recessions and bare marks early signal given years 8798 2009 2011 2020 uh forward returns and positivity rates 1 month out up 10% we saw that last month 3 months out up 18% 6 months out up 31% 12 months out up 51% uh all with a 100 positivity rate after you get past that first first month which we had in July so expect more to come meaning potentially another 40% more to come in small caps    this is also from Tom Lee via Seth golden 2-year yield minus bed fun funds rate Gap is a big risk on Signal which anticipates a 4 to 5% S&P 500 rally ahead which would imply we do get a bounce from the tech Magnificent Seven stocks that have been beat down in as a matter of fact that basket after I went on and talked about the C change out of the Magnificent 7 into the UNM magnificent 493    that basket there's an ETF called Big T uh that is the Magnificent 7 and it dropped 15% over the next few weeks the Magnificent 7 while the rest of the stuff like Banks were up 18% and everything else new vehicle total inventory this is exactly what we wanted to see we're going to start to see more incentives and more reasons to get people out replacing those 13 and a half year old cars uh which is going to be a big deal and margins for the oems are going to go down because they're going to be in price Wars but doing big volumes and like like generators when your neighbor gets one you want one and we're going to get a big refresh cycling cars as the prices come down as rates come down as incentives go up as inventories build it's a good thing for for Cooper standard which is not in the arms War it's in the arms dealing business which is what we want to be in    okay here's another thing from uh Jim Paulson via Seth Seth golden uh basically he's talking about when the 10year yield Falls and M2 money supply Rises like they are now historically S&P delivers higher returns than when these two variables are not moving in opposite opposite directions so while everyone knows September Is A bad month when both of these things are happening 10 yield is falling and money supply is rising you often get positive months so that could actually throw the weakness pre-election weakness idea and September weakness and sell the news weakness out the window I wouldn't bet on that but I like the fact that I like the idea despite what you saw today I like the ideaa that    the market holds up into September we we will see    some of that will have to do with Apple earnings which I think we're okay after hours I'm just looking at the screen while I'm talking and Amazon uh so we'll see how those come in if those two can bounce even if Nvidia keeps falling    I think that uh we'll get the bounce in the S&P 500 first time since 2020 that we've seen six straight declines in the 10-year yield of two basis points or more uh so that's that the change in the FED statement here uh leads to September for sure ADP employment I think we're getting close to the end here and then July performance this is very important I just ran these numbers in in advance of going on claiming tomorrow for July the S&P was only up 1% Dow was up 4.5% Russell small caps were up 10.4% and the NASDAQ was down 1.68% small Banks were up 18.6% reats were up 75% utilities were up 7% Industrials were up 5% and mag 7 was down 35 basis points semiconductors were down 5% here's 80% of global Central Bank are expected to be in easing mode by the end of 2024 versus only 10% in July 2023 that's good news but right now Japan is tightening and not enough of the West is uh easing yet so I think you could see some choppiness unless they use other facilities to paper it over until September    consensus 12-month forward EPS growth projections continue to Trend up across regions that's Asia Pacific Europe and the US that's positive more often than not the s&p500 delivered robust returns following the first fed cut here's the S&P return since 1950 when the US economy did not see a recession within a year of the first Fed rate cut so first month after the average return is negative -3% so we want to keep that in mind as we you know if we show continued strength into mid-september before the FED meeting that will be an opportunity for us to get more defensive raise some cash maybe put on some tactical shorts uh for that month into the election and then two months after you're up on average 7% 3 months after up 10% uh 6 months after 12% 12 months after 15% so I think this time will be similar\n\nAmazon uh so we'll see how those come in if those two can bounce even if Nvidia keeps falling uh I think that uh we'll get the bounce in the S&P 500 first time since 2020 that we've seen six straight declines in the 10-year yield of two basis points or more uh so that's that the change in the FED statement here uh leads to September for sure ADP employment I think we're getting close to the end here and then July performance this is very important I just ran these numbers in in advance of

2023 that's good news but right now Japan is tightening and not enough of the West is uh easing yet so I think you could see some choppiness unless they use other facilities to paper it over until September uh consensus 12-month forward EPS growth projections continue to Trend up across regions that's Asia Pacific Europe and the US that's positive more often than not the s&p500 delivered robust

this time will be similar\n\num sentiment survey basically no change since last week uh bearishness went down bullishness ticked up and then onto some China stuff then we'll get to the US and then

right China's poet burrow meeting sends Positive Vibes to investors after third Plum disappoint Co so that was their kind of backtrack Market didn't really respond because of everything else going on y3m stock fro 23% on Friday uh so all that's coming the new CEO is doing a great job we'll cover some of that in our article of the week Buffett Cuts Bank of America stake unloading $3 billion this month so uh most crowded trades are getting liquidated we saw that coming PayPal stock Rises sharply after beat and rais quarter we're going to cover that 3M had its very best day ever\nthe new CEO started with a bang uh we'll cover that in a troubled box office premium still sells that was the biggest R rated movie launch ever uh Deadpool and Wolverine is owned by Marvel owned by Disney uh so that's two monster Blockbusters in the same year markets attributing zero value to that inside out was a billion inside out to was a billion doll uh deal and Deadpool is going to be a beast as well Nvidia stock swon didn't slow CEO Jon Wong sales so he continues to dump stocks on all the retail investors head who bought the split Wall Street says buy stocks that pay dividends with $6 trillion doll of cash ready to be deployed as rates come down uh they're going to be forced out of their money markets and everything else and they're going to go into dividend stocks and that's where value is going to out continue to outperform growth PayPal stock stores as earnings bring big positive surprise on this key number what's the key number is transaction margin dollars which was the name of the game game that everyone was worried about and they've turned the corner as anticipated that move is just beginning Bank of England decision another Central Bank Cuts ahead of the FED Disney bets on Deadpool Wolverine and dirty jokes to save Marvel whatever it takes like I told you Bob Iger will play Bible movies 24/7 if it means iida will go back up they learned their lessons they went woke but they don't want to go broke so they're pivoting xbo earnings show us manufacturing improved shares rise fed path for September interest rate cut that's after the fact Tim maros the FED Whisperer wrote that so it's telling us what we already know there's gun laac saying they should have cut yesterday we agree us productivity rebounds sharply in the second quarter which could help a soft Landing so you're seeing all these mixed things there's enough good happening to overcome the FED sucking its thumb but uh if they suck for too long we're going to wind up with uh some issues so uh and it's going to cost them much more go down as one of the worst fed chairs in history versus one of the best and then the difference between those two binary outcomes could be you know two months difference uh or in this case six or eight weeks but I think he can get away with uh sitting on his hands in July but he won't be able to get away with sitting on his hands in September initial jobless claims rise to onee high as hiring slows that's the key message China revs up us up fiscal policy support to Spur economic recovery so they're back back at it can Kelly ortberg turn Boeing around people like him from Rockwell Collins uh he had a huge run with his stock while he was running that I think he's going to do the same for Boeing since 1995 value stocks have always outperformed when they're this cheap by a big margin and uh so we covered these two charts earlier Intel to cut okay so Intel reported after hours their stock is down I want to listen to the call he's going to be on CNBC tomorrow my guess is if he was if it was a disaster he would throw his CFO on instead of himself so he'll he'll be there tomorrow to talk it up but this really does not change the long-term strategy so they're cutting a bunch of costs they miss bu a hair um I'll wait and uh listen to the call tonight before we add any shares or make a decision whether we're going to add any shares but we're comfortable with ours if you remember we bought it 25 we sold 2/3 at 20 at 48 and then we re rebuilt the position between 29 and 31 so we've made some money on it the question is do we want to add more back at 25 or 24 wherever is it is after hours and uh after the call I'll make that decision but um uh more likely than not uh I think it it makes sense and uh unless I hear something in the call that's uh egregious but the Legacy business so they Revenue declined by 1% that's not the end of the world um and remember the whole growth story story is the 45 billion of Grants tax breaks and Loans from the US government to to stand up a duopoly with Taiwan semiconductor that all the Western Fortune 500s are going to push their demand through uh due to government pressure so um that's not in the numbers yet Canada Goose reported uh surprising because it surprisingly okay given that it's off seon they were able so the wholesale continues to go down the directed consumer continues to go up which is going to increase margins over time which we like China was up again I was a little worried about China because every other company had china down uh but China was actually up and Asia Pacific was up so those were strong reg regions um uh overall for the company revenues were up a few percent and then their their margins were a little bit worse because they bought a new Factory that they have to take the cost out of so they had some impact but revenues for the quarter were up you know 5% basically uh from 84 to 88 million year on year so uh so the business continues to do well and is what is considered to be a week quarter so I'll listen to that one that one came out today as well Pals TRS and towels\n\nthey're cutting a bunch of costs they miss bu a hair um I'll wait and uh listen to the

to talk to uh Neil Cavuto about was that you've got an AI arms race between Microsoft Google and Amazon uh and the arms dealers look like they're winning which is Invidia AMD and Intel in the short term but I think you're going to see um couple of the things is that you've got like you saw AMD earnings were good because demand for their gpus went up so not everyone wants only um Nvidia and if you saw meta's report yeah they were going to have like 100,000 uh h100s but then another 350,000 uh other gpus which you know other is could be Intel as we know the gouty 3 is 50% faster 50% cheaper and uses 40% less energy which is a huge operating cost for these data centers for the hyperscalers so um so I think nvidia's margin is going to be Intel opportunity and then Microsoft Google and Amazon in short term are going to have declining margins as they continue aggressive cap X until the shareholders stop them but seoa put out the key article which was the $600 billion question which says that the amount that they're spending right now is not even remotely justified by earnings so their margins are going to crash and that's why you see the decelerating earnings in that group and that they're uh stock started to um move down okay\n### FEATURED_COMPANY_DEEP_DIVES\nPayPal update so they had their best transaction margin dollar growth since 2021 they raised their 2024 guidance and increased the share repurchase they're coming from a position of strength so so what does that mean the most important thing that came out of this call is that they said uh we're not going to do $5 billion of free cash flow this year we're actually going to do $6 billion of free cash flow this year and you can't give away the stock it's mind-boggling oh and by the way we're not going to buy $5 billion of stock back uh this year like we did last year we're going to buy $6 billion back of stock uh which means you're going to own a bigger slice of the pie without putting any new money out of pocket revenues were up 8% transaction margin dollars were up 8% year on year operating income was up 17% year on year operating margin expanded 126 basis points EPS increased 177% that's a Growth Company ladies and gentlemen uh not a value trap that's a Growth Company total payment volume up 11% payment transactions 8% they even re accelerated active accounts uh by almost 2 million SE qu qually from last quarter to this quarter and generated 1.4 billion of free cash flow in this quarter alone they've got $18 billion of cash by the way uh net cash about 6 billion 12 billion of debt returned 1.5 billion to stockholders buying 24 million shares of common stock at low prices by the way which is when you want them to buy it which is the name of the game so you can see here every metric basically up margins up revenues up transactions up share count collapsing went from in uh 2023 uh 1.1 billion to uh just over 1.04 billion so they've taken out you know 6 60 million shares give or take no 60 58 78 million shares I mean that's pretty awesome and that's going to go down they're going to be below a billion shares which is pretty exciting um all right then you got uh adjusted free cash flow active accounts were up 2 million sequentially um transactions per active account up 11% driven by brain free transaction growth which is what everyone hated because it brought the overall margins and take rate down now that's reaccelerating remember fast lane increased conversion from 50% to 880 % that's rolling out in Earnest the second half that's going to be huge for the company their ad business is rolling out they just did a deal with door Dash and others uh then you've got uh their guidance they took up not only on free cash flow and BuyBacks but they took up their transaction um margin dollars uh from before slightly positive to low to mid single digit growth for fiscal year 2024 for uh non-gaap non-transaction operating expenses then you've got effective tax rate that's not a big deal EPS they went from mid to high single digigit growth to low to mid teens growth that is a monstrous difference and then they took up their Gap EPS to 388 to 398 range from 365 which is another huge jump and then free cash flow and share repurchase so it's huge absolutely hug huge venmo momentum continues to build in monthly active accounts increased across PayPal and venmo fast lane and ads platform is a big deal deal uh expand our addressable Market turn into a growth company which is a big deal deepening our partnership they're doing a huge deal with meta okay so one great meta which we already partner with on multiple fronts PayPal is a top payment method for advertisers and consumers globally across meta family of apps meta dominations and charitable giving campaigns now run on on PayPal giving fund platform meta pays out creators and developers using hyperwallet and meta uses brain tree for credit card processing meta is Facebook and Instagram for those of you and WhatsApp we are working closely with meta to optimize the experiences and look forward to deepening our partnership with meta in mutually beneficial ways in months and years ahead foundation for our next phase of growth they also did a renewed our contract with door Dash to expand how we work together Beyond unbranded PSP processing and offering our branded marks door Dash also relies on our risk capabilities to mitigate losses they will be participating with our new ads platform and remember that changed the game for Amazon when they added the ads business and for Uber uh margin of creative helping us to more profitable Dynamic we expect fast lane generally available in the US in the second half of the year so and by the way they're putting ascribing zero to their guidance raise to the benefits that fast Lane's going to bring to their margin which are going to be off the charts fast lane will accelerate PayPal's ability to capture roughly 60% share of e-commerce purchases made without a branded Mark best-in-class checkout experience in the second quarter we launched inapp offers with Major Brands including Best Buy Price Line lyt instacart Ticket Master Walmart and Nordstrom um redesigned vating payment page alone shows a conversion lift of 75 to 111 basis points in fact we drove almost 20 million app logins from our postp purchase experiences in June alone growing More than 70% from a year ago turning to venmo we're building on the business's strong Market position in the second quarter venmo process more than 73\nbillion in total payment volume growing 8% year-over-year with monthly active increasing 5% year over year to nearly 62 million both a strong base of peer-to-peer users and Adoption of our ecosystem of products are driving this growth for example both venmo debit card and pay with venmo monthly active users grew 30% uh we launched a push provisioning of the venmo debit card to Apple and Google wallets and continue to enable PayPal pay with venmo with merchants and partners including eBay and StubHub recently launched venmo teen venmo is primed for growth making it easier to add PayPal and venmo branded cards to Apple and Google Wallets on mobile devices etc etc so uh we were encouraged to see the sustained total active account growing growth following a positive inflection in the first quarter so they went from Contracting to expansion that's what you want to see at inflection points um transactions per active account which is a triling 12mth number with 60.9 in the second quarter up 11% transactions per active account grew 6% total payment volume grew 11% uh and total payment volume International also grew 11% Etc so there's just unbelievable things happening since this guy took over PayPal generated 1.4 billion in free cash flow 1.5 billion in share purchases bringing repurchases to 5 billion raising our guidance uh re accelerating durable profitable growth for the company given the strong start to the year we are raising our free cash flow guidance we covered that grew profitably venmo customers venmo ecosystem fast lane conversion from 50 to 80% we covered ### FEATURED_COMPANY_DEEP_DIVES\nStanley Black and Decker so I mean these have these things are starting to move Stanley Black and& Decker up from 77 to $107 in the last you know month uh that's a pretty big move um basically they had lower inventory destocking uh costs which is going to lead to restocking like we've said uh change supply chain transformation benefits and reduce shipping costs they should just Outsource the gxo by the way uh on track for expected pre-tax run rate Savings of 1.5 billion by the end of 2024 they've already done 1.3 and two billion by the end of 2025 I think we had done the math on that and uh it was like it was worth like $80 a share at at the normal historic multiple and that excludes the business but anyway let's just stick to the facts here uh organic Revenue growth led by DeWalt which is good gross margin was up 600 basis points to 28.4 their goal is to get to 30 back to 35% which they will um cash from operating activities was 573 million free cash flow was 486 million that's what you want to see in a turnaround story they have Runway uh they raise their earnings guidance to a basically 8040 basically 410 midpoint from a 4.0 midpoint so 370 to 450 from 350 to 450 and they raised their free cash flow to uh 750 million midpoint from a $700 million midpoint so that's huge uh supply chain improvements volume growth reaccelerating all the things you want to hear uh Cost Cuts in and then getting back to growth and getting getting revenues growing again so they're focused on all of it 3M again huge move here since February or or last you know if you go into the fall remember the last quarter we had that huge run from 68 to 90 then it checked back to 74 it's gone from 74 to 128 in the last four months this one's a beast plus we also got svent for free uh with the spin-off so uh you know these things take time but when they go they go all at once um so their organic growth was up modestly their Gap EPS was up 117% adjusted EPS up 39% operating CA uh cash flow a billion adjusted free cash flow was 1.2 billion so they free cash flow generative and they are uh increasing their guidance from [Music] a 705 midpoint to a 715 midpoint which is really good uh and everything's hitting on all cylinders again new CEO new jockey turnaround story and things moving in the right direction they returned 786 million to shareholders via dividends and share repurchases um and moved up their end point so you can go through some of these on the different divisions whether it's safety and Industrial Transportation Electronics consumer full year guidance they took their adjusted operating margin up uh from a 237 bips midpoint increased to a 250 bip so they're they're they're going faster than they expected which is a good thing and uh all is in place so they've talked about spinning out the business all the things that they've already accomplished and uh strong balance sheet we repurchased about 400 million of stock in the second quarter have the capacity to do more in the second half of next year they're going to do Acquisitions I'll be taking a fresh dispassionate look not only at am m&a but uh at our portfolio to determine if there's any asss that have greater value owned by others along the same line what assets might be a good fit for 3M I don't have anything to say on that yet so he's he's doing a portfolio management which is a good thing ### MACRO_DATA_SLIDES\nmoving on retail earnings top 30 weights of the sector uh estimates were revised up for next year by three bips down for this year by 62 bips transports were both both revised down for this year and next year 340 bips and 360 bips so you have to keep an eye on it my guess is that's skewed to one company though so Uber uh has come down uh no let's see here let's see where the big hit was FedEx a little bit oh probably UPS where's UPS yeah UPS was a big contributor to that um s a a and those look like the the big ones all right ### HEADLINES_AND_NEWS\nuh tomorrow we've got uh the jobs report expected private non-farm payrolls expected to be plus 176 um we probably want to see a bit lower than 176 uh in order to keep the September guarantee on the table but not so much more that people panic that there's no back stop before September so uh you don't want to see a a super low number also watch the revisions downward and then\n\n they returned 786 million to shareholders via dividends and share repurchases um and moved up their end point so you can go through some of these on the different divisions whether it's safety and Industrial Transportation Electronics consumer full year guidance they took their adjusted operating margin up uh from a 237 bips midpoint increased to a 250 bip so they're they're they're going faster than they expected which is a good thing and uh all is in place so they've talked about spinning out the business all the things that they've already accomplished and uh strong balance sheet we repurchased about 400 million of stock in the second quarter have the capacity to do more in the second half of next year they're going to do Acquisitions I'll be taking a fresh dispassionate

bips down for this year by 62 bips transports were both both revised down for this year and next year 340 bips and 360 bips so you have to keep an eye on it my guess is that's skewed to one company though so Uber uh has come down uh no let's see here let's see where the big hit was FedEx a little bit oh probably UPS where's UPS yeah UPS was a big contributor to that um s a a and those look like

September guarantee on the table but not so much more that people panic that there's no back stop before September so uh you don't want to see a a super low number also watch the revisions downward and then finally  this is the stuff that's holding up the market you know earning here are margins are reaccelerating from the dstock to the restock cycle and then you see uh earnings growth is 9.8 versus 88.9% estimates uh as I said expectations were High secret happiness is low expectations so it's coming in higher but not as high above as it had in previous quarters so you're getting a little chop here and then uh estimates have been a little soft the last few months so we want to see a little re acceleration we saw 1% since the beginning of July let's see if that persists after we get to the end of this week with so many companies having reported so let's get on to\n\n earning here are margins are reaccelerating from the dstock to the restock cycle and then you see uh earnings growth is 9.8 versus 88.9% estimates uh as I said expectations were High secret happiness is low expectations so it's coming in higher but not as high above as it had in previous quarters so you're getting a little chop here and then uh estimates have been a little soft the last few months so we want to see a little re acceleration we saw 1% since the beginning of July let's see if that persists after we get to the end of this week with so many companies having reported so let's get on to uh well first off\n\n### ASK_ME_ANYTHING_QA\nwith that said  uh we are going to go on to the\nask me anything  question for those of you who just like the podcast part we'll see next week for those of you who like the\n\n### ASK_ME_ANYTHING_QA\nask me anything question for those of you who just like the podcast part we'll see next week for those of you who like the\n\n--- OVERLAP CONTINUED ---\n\nask me anything\n\nEdgard Abu says first of all thanks for the quality information you provide every day and week I've been listening for two years Chang my way to investing I'd like you to have a look at crowd strike very niche market getting bitter by the day 18% market share recent events provideed by opportunity uh we cannot quantify how much they're going to have to pay out one Airline asked them for a half a billion dollar that's number one number two a friend actually contacted me on this who owned owned it and you know he was saying that um and and you know my first response to him was look I don't own stocks like that it when when he contacted me it was trading at 75 billion now it's at 54 billion by the way uh but that was after the First full it was trading at 75 billion and I said look you know it was trading at 16 times sales that's that's not a business I would ever own in a million years um irrespective of How High the momentum goes or anything else so uh you know so would I own it at 11 times sales uh and the answer is um 11 times sales and 40 times earnings what's the earnings growth 20 times no I probably wouldn't so um could it get a bounce you know with uh with a tech bounce sure it could but I think there's any way to quantify this risk so for me it's a it's a pass there's down and down for a reason uh so that's that Allen hair uh morning Tom been listening for a while really enjoy the content no in the past you mentioned no interest in Ford or GM but after Ford's big drop last week has that impacted your opinion okay so Ford and GM are annuity and healthcare companies with a car business attached on the side and for that reason I will never own own an oem a union-based business because you don't control your margins you don't control your future and uh and in that regard uh sold to you so um Jim Jones would you look at Smith and Wesson uh I've looked at this thing a million times the numbers look great and the stock never does anything so I would say no but I'll just take one more look at it um because it's been a while Smith and Wesson well let me just type in Wesson all right s swbi all right so it's training at about half off what's happening with the business s swbi so I guess these people are are asking me because they think it's going to do really well if there's a change in administration I think it doesn't matter because look look the last Administration came in here the stock collapsed from 2016 to 2020 it went from 20 down to three um and then under the current Administration where you think it would do terrible it went from 3 to 35 so uh all right well there you go um now cash flows re accelerating but revenues are collapsing uh gross margins collapsing I I'm going to say say pass that not for me I understand why you're looking at it maybe it works but I wouldn't be I wouldn't be interested Zack tan like your opinion on a potential hedge between Cooper standard and Advanced Auto Parts given the age of vehicles is hting 13 and a half do you agree that stock movements could complement each other when fundamentals either ship bullish or bearish for vehicle production besides being backed by market fundamentals huge oper that are being worked on supply chain they're not going to hedge each other they're they're discret businesses okay the people who who won't be able to get in new cars uh you know that aren't the 18 million people is you know 315 million other people that have old crappy cars that have to fix them so once they fix the business uh it's going to make money again and um I think they're both great so they're not hedging anything don't over complicate it they're two discret businesses uh can you take a look at global payment Network and arsal or Mattel Mattel we did I'm not interested in that business gpn is uh it's too opaque for me because you've got Consumer Debt that I can't quantify and I don't understand what's on off balance sheet on balance sheet so uh for me it's probably a pass I I understand s swp not swpi um gpn is getting cheap but te operates Merchant settlement funding chargeback resolution R of software streamline businesses I I've got enough payments business with the PayPal well I'll just focus on that I um gpn uh let's see here I mean look it's a lowquality business it's definitely trading towards the low end of its range I mean if you want to take a little risk I I I don't like the business enough I'm just going to tell you I looked at it in the past I think it could certainly Bounce from here and keep going I just I just don't love it here so I'm going to pass even though it does look attractive and I understand how you got there um but it's not for me Martin florini love to hear your thoughts on tbbb it's a Mexican food chain I'm going to along the lines of Aldi growing Revenue in stores uh supermarkets are not good businesses unless you're Walmart so I'm probably a pass there's there's really not enough information for me and not enough of an operating history for me to get comfortable um I generally only invest in public companies that have I I mean you'd have to pull up the perspectives and see their last 20 years of data I I mean I understand wanting to get some exposure to Mexico uh don't get me wrong um gross margins mid teens free cash flows growing revenues are growing yeah it it's just not for me I I don't think there's anything wrong with it but it's not the kind of business that I invest in um doesn't mean it won't work it certainly could but it's not it's going to work without me Adam thoughts on whirpool we've covered this one I think it's okay I think you're going to get the uh cycle back going here again um and you get a dividend while you wait uh I think there was a problem with cash flow with this one though yeah so it's just starting to re accelerate revenues got hammered so you just have to you have to do your work and understand what's the plan to turn it around and if it's a plausible plan and who's doing the turnaround and if you can get comfort with all those things I mean you probably have a decent enough margin of safety let's see where the uh balance sheet is billion doll of cash $6.4 billion of debt on one and a half billion of cash so you definitely want to uh get a sense of when all of those are uh maturing like in um the case of Canada Goose we've got a couple years to 2027 same as uh Cooper standard so we're comfortable there so you got to get Comfort on that but all in you should probably be able to make this one work Adam after you do your work uh longtime listener Stefon from Canada paycom we've covered that a bunch of times and we passed on it all times uh I don't have any Edge as to what their mode is so for me it's a pass um I don't know how they retain share but the numbers look definitely attractive even though Revenue growth is decelerating so then you're going to get multiple contraction um the question is what was the multiple so five times sales 20 times earnings what's the earnings cash flow is probably a cash machine yes Capital yeah I mean look if you can get comfort that they're going to maintain their moat and what they have is impenetrable then yeah I mean it looks great on paper um but that's that's a big project to get comfort that their mode is gonna not not erode um and I understand why you got there and there's probably something to it but you know often times when these things break they just take a long time so um for that reason I'm I'm going to take a pass on that one even though it could certainly work for you after you do more more work uh next is Sam R what's your opinion on macro Legends like Soros dren Miller and macro hedge funds in general hard to be consistently good and more oneoff amazing trade that defines them I I think it's just a different way to make money I mean there's a ton of ways to make money you know you there's not one right way so uh in the case of dren Miller and Soros which is basically the same thing they had a monster trade where they shorted the British pound and they got lucky with some policy changes but um you know over time drun and Miller has delivered so that it's a different style so has Buffett so has the guy at Renaissance who does you know high frequency trading it's just many different ways to make money so uh I've got nothing really to say other than uh congratulations on an incredible long-term track record you know same thing I would say to Buffett and uh and many others so River Rahi uh you just have to know what you're good at that that that's really what what it comes down to I like the time Arbitrage business buy quality businesses IGN the short-term noise as long as the fundamentals are improving eventually the price will catch up use low leverage so you can live and to see the realization and over time you're going

    "MISCELLANEOUS": "\n\n### MISCELLANEOUS\nwelcome to hedge fun tips with Tom Hayes I'm Tom Hayes and this is your 250th podcast video cast for the week ending August 1st 2024 what an exciting month July was August uh off to a rocky start but uh but that's normal in in the first few days of the month and uh couple of exciting things going on that we'll share with you I want to get right down to it first and foremost want to thank my buddy Chris down in Dallas for sending me this new mug he sent me a two mugs at or actually a bunch of mugs when we did the 200th uh episode and this one says this one's white versus black and then there was also uh blue great Hill Capital ones this one says on one side HED fun tips and on the other side opinions not advice see terms so now I could just say that everything go to hedge fun tips see terms thank you so much for thinking of me\n\n### MISCELLANEOUS\nthat would require $600 billion of new Revenue to justify the cost and they break down SAS margins and uh Etc and what we saw with alphabet was a concerning Trend where the capex was was very high and the revenues were not yet nearly supportive to justify that capex and you've effectively had an arms race with all of big big Tech trying to hoard as many high-end chips as they possibly could as quickly as they could so that their competition didn't have it but there the revenues that support that level of spend are nowhere to be found so there's a there's a fear about margins there's a fear about how long will it take if ever to fill that $600 billion Revenue hole commencer it with the capex bend that we've seen uh and the front loading of the the chip hoarding so you know I think that big Tech and magn 7 have come in a reasonable amount but it wouldn't surprise me look I would say this it would surprise me if this was another 2000 Tech wre I don't see that coming because these are huge free cash flow generators which was not the case in 2000 so I wouldn't compare it to that uh but I think prospectively certainly for the next 9 to 18 months we should see a scenario where irrespective of tomorrow's earnings or or the day after's earnings where the mag magnificent 7 as a basket underperforms the unmagnify I.E the second half of the year we should see more subdued General indices because of the weights of magnificent 7 within the market cap weight indices and uh huge monstrous opportunities under the surface for the Left Behind stocks I mean you saw a couple today that we've talked a lot about on our podcast and and in public uh TV appearances you know PayPal is up uh seven eight percent today on beating earnings Stanley Black and Decker talk about old world uh is up seven or eight% on beating earnings so there's a lot of great stuff happening under the surface that gets no\n### MISCELLANEOUS\nheadlines  while everyone's overcrowded into the mag 7 that the air is leaking out of that balloon I don't I wouldn't say it's going to pop or anything like that I would just say it's it's going to be much more subdued for the near term yeah so you've been calling for a rotation out of the mag s and big Tech into small caps even though as you said there's been a lot of skepticism around that idea now we see that shift appears to have started can you walk us through your thesis and what you see happening into the end of the year and even into next year I know on your podcast you referred to 2025 as the year of the small caps yeah yeah I think well I I think we've started in 2024 and and we'll see more of that in in the second half of 2024 and that should continue into 2025 as a matter of fact historically since World War II small caps outperform large caps by about 11% in the first 12 months after the first cut so if if our base case is correct in September is the first cut that would imply a meaningful outperformance uh again for you know another 14 16 18 months the first part of that easing cycle and and I think that's going to be positive but you know a lot of people are skeptical that you know there have been several fake outs Etc and I think what's different this time is the earnings composition has dramatically changed so we started the year with enormous earnings growth for the Magnificent Seven with the first quarter alone they had 50% earnings growth -0 and the unmagnify had negative 1% so it's it's no wonder that they dramatically uh underperformed the 493 and the mag 7 dramatically outperformed the earnings growth was there well that composition is changing it's expected by the fourth quarter that the unmagnify will have 19% earnings growth and the Magnificent 7 will have 177% earnings growth which is why I say they'll be fine they're just in our view going to underperform because they're decelerating in earnings growth versus the rest of the market is accelerating and then as far as supporting the underlying thesis in small caps in addition to cyclicals and and the unmagnify 493 the earnings growth this year is about 4% uh and next year it's expected to be 177% whereas large caps are going to be 14% earnings growth next year and their 12% this year so uh it's not a hope or a wish uh the only thing that could change that thesis would be a dramatic change in earnings expectations for small caps versus large caps caps and so far we're not seeing that so far it's actually right on schedule and uh and we're going to see more of that I I think in the last few days or so where you saw little hiccup when kamla was announced as the candidate you saw teex start to take off and uh the unmagnify uh take a little rest but I think that was also a function of they mooved so far so fast I think it was something like 133% in a week and a half small caps as a basket moved it was just an excuse to rest so irrespective of the president uh who's elected Etc I think this this trend is going to persist because the composition and the cost of capital cycle supports it well the Russell 2000 is up about 11% since the second quarter ended now how should investors be positioning themselves for a longer term shift and what data should they be paying particular attention to yeah I think a couple of things are are going going to take place number one the UNM magnificent 493 so there will be large caps that do extremely well that have lagged the non non magnificent 7 then you've got anything interest rate sensitive so dividend Growers Stanley Black and& Decker is a great example of that um cyclicals REITs are another one that have been left for dead they're the most under owned since 2009 everyone's calling for commercial real estate uh apocalypse we think there t\n\noftest since 2020 so everything is showing signs of disinflation but he did emphasize the Dual mandate and he started to make the case again that he was focusing just as much on inflation as now he is focused on employment he doesn't want to see material cracks in or weakening in the labor market which he's focused on like a hawk which uh you know just a month or two months ago he was only focused on inflation so this is a key turning point and he's seeing what the Market's seeing and that is he's going to have to move uh pretty quickly certainly in September as a matter of fact city was out today saying they start in September and they go all the way down to 3 and a half% which would be you know four or five consecutive Cuts in a row wow that'd be interesting now also uh we've heard the FED talk about it's important to not act too soon but you certainly don't want to act too late which is what you're talking about right now so if the economy is moving moving closer to its 2% inflation Target uh but there's still no question that consumers are feeling the bite you talked about some but people still grousing obviously about grocery prices housing uh talk about some of the problem areas and the frustration that people deal with day in and day out yeah there's no question I mean the real issue is incomes have actually risen slightly faster than overall inflation but it hurts people at the lower end because inflation is taxation without representation is basically what it comes down to it hits everyone and it hits people with the lowest discretionary income the hardest people that have to pay for regular Necessities food gasoline Etc on a daily basis rent on a daily basis uh and those prices unfortunately are not going back to pre-pandemic levels the best we can hope for is that they go down to increasing by 2% a year which is the goal but the FED has indicated they have to move before that Target is hit otherwise you run the risk of deflation and you know the key thing### MISCELLANEOUS\nhere is  it's it's binary if they move too quickly they have a quick tool to bring it back in uh they can they can start hiking again but if they move too slowly and disinflation turns into deflation that can be extremely costly and hurt a lot of people you know the the saying is most people would rather pay an extra dollar for a gallon of milk and still have a job than have no job and he's focused on in on that right now and that's what's causing him to move in September yeah quickly those of with retirement accounts they've had a pretty good year Market's doing well uh now if there's a cut in September and another at the uh end of the year tell us what you believe is going to happen to the markets and if that doesn't happen what's going to happen to the markets well I think you shouldn't think about a retirement account in a quarterly basis you should think of it in years uh however it would be natural to see some short-term volatility ahead of the election which is you know late September early October and that just happens to line up with the FED meeting on the 17th 18 so coincident or causal it wouldn't surprise me if we see some continued strength uh over the next few weeks and then some some fall volatility uh along the lines of the election and or the FED meeting in September it could be and a lot of people are pointing to it could be a shortterm sell the news before a year-end uh rally that would not in fact surprise me at all but I but I wouldn't stay short too long because I think think after you get the certainty around the election regardless of who is elected you're going to see a rally into year end as the market absorbs all the new news so what we like to do over here at Great Hill capital is buy high quality companies when they're on sale and hold on to them for a while excellent advice excellent advice Thomas hay is always a pleasure thank you so much for your Insight thank you Sean and we're back and then\n\nmonths where everything that you own is up like crazy uh it's easy to think you're a genius but you have to keep an eye on the underlying fundamentals of the business and then in days when things are down dramatically you say to yourself okay what's changed about xyz's ability to sell X and if nothing's changed then you ignore the short-term volatility moving on uh want to get through some of the data now Dudley citing growing recession risk urges fed to cut rates as soon as what would have been yesterday um Jeffrey gunak who runs double line a huge bond shop I think 80 billion under management uh also said the FED should have cut yesterday and then when we saw the weak employment data this morning which kind of threw the market into a tizzy uh people started saying they should have Jeremy seagull was out saying 50 basis points is not off the table for September so they might have to play a little catchup I think they'll be going uh be okay going in September let's see the numbers tomorrow the good news is earnings are still holding up well which will buy them enough time but I think if they go much later than September they're going to get a hard landing and um he couldn't say it any more clearly which is you know to gun laak's point if you're going to say that you're going in September just go just go now like what's the difference of seven or eight weeks um the key thing that's happening under the surface that no one's really talking about in the US aggressively is that Japan has been a Global liquidity provider for 2 years while the rest of the world was tightening and now they've moved abruptly into being a liquidity extractor by tightening and starting to discontinue their quantitative easing and what is a seamless transition would be if the FED started easing at the same time that Japan was tightening but since there's a 6 we 8we window that that's not the case we could see uh issues with short-term liquidity and that will finally  Force the fed's hand so uh this type of uh volatility should be expected you saw the Nik was down 3% overnight and then we opened up strong which made little sense um so let's just see my guess is you're going to see more fed liquidity provisioning in the repurchases of balance sheet rolloff so they'll probably ramp that up for the next 6 weeks until they can\n\nUK manufacturing recovering that's good for gxo uh UK business activity picks up after pre-election low that's good US dollar Japanese Yen Japanese yen is collapsing as we anticipated it started in July it's absolutely rolling over big time and that's going to be good in time for China it's you know it's taking forever but it's uh all of the pieces of the script that we needed to play out are playing out have we gotten a bazooka no but we've gotten a t ton of uh small shotgun rounds that added together could be the equivalent of a cannon with a time lag and then we're getting the 180 million of new buyers so I love seeing this Yen weekend uh I'm sorry strength in relative to the US dollar that was key to get the hot money flows that came from China to Japan and India everyone thought those were fundamentally based we disagree um uh and as the Yen strengthens we'll see if those hot money flows flow back into China when it happens it happens all at once we got a taste of that with cyclicals and small caps and banks in the month of July they all just went up all at the same time as we had been calling for in the sea change ### MISCELLANEOUS\n\n### MISCELLANEOUS\nTesla people are underestimating this demand for grid storage probably by orders of magnitude which helps gener and we saw that uh okay alphabet the risk of underinvestigated the amount that they've been spending hoarding semiconductors uh would have to generate 600 billion of new Revenue in order to maintain margins so what you saw with Microsoft 77% growth in capex and a 15% growth in Revenue means their margins are going to go to hell in the short term which is why this rotation is going to be sustained and you're seeing decelerating earnings growth in uh big Tech and accelerating earnings growth in the unmagnify and small caps um Royal Caribbean robust booking and pricing uh earnings estimates are up 1% since July 1st so so that's a positive thing with um S&P up in aggregate the only group that's down is energy which is kind of interesting uh when you consider the data that just came out we used the most amount of natural gas for energy than we've ever used in history last month so that's positive financials are are the biggest part of the upward revisions we did take some City and Bank of America off in the last week or so um to lock in profits those have been big movers for us and um maybe we can redeploy at lower levels we'll see how that works out but sometimes you got to ring the register uh mentions of weak demand are also and Buffett you saw Buffett out there selling a ton of Bank of America I I don't really pay much attention to that anymore but it's been such aggressive selling uh that it was noted especially when you know they were overbought trading at a premium to book all the things that are the opposite of why I buy but I do want to get back into those because I don't think the banking cycle has even begun yet and um and we've got some still but um less than we did and and booked a nice profit on that if you look at the City chart it was uh a big one for us so okay moving along  mentions of weak demand remain elevated but are rolling over this is what you see after Bottoms like 2009 to 2010 and mid 2000 to two 2020 to 2021 so that that rolling over same as midcycle 2012 and 13 so that's positive uh first EPS growth quarter for the other 493 we've talked about this this is the updated number numbers and what you're basically seeing\n\nEquity positioning across sectors we covered that then you got the Russell 2000 to S&P 500 look how this thing turned the corner overnight uh when it comes it comes all at once so you can see that visually and for those those of you listening I you know if you listen that's fantastic if you watch it you will get more value because you can see things that you know I'm just a data person so I like to look at it but look listening is better than not you know not doing anything uh in terms of getting information you can see the equity sentiment was unchanged in in June it's kind of midlevel moving towards extreme but not anywhere near there yet Wake Me Up When September Ends annualized S&P price return by month so July is a great month and that was clear uh with a uh average 22% annualized so if you take it times 12 for those of you who don't aren't familiar with these terms uh August is not that bad it's more like June which can be choppy but tends to be okay September is kind of the worst month of the year so I think if we get continued strength for the next few weeks um there's also some stats I think I have the chart in here where after the first cut the first month is weak but then you get 3 months and 6 months 12 months it's all good good so that kind of lines up the 17th and 18th maybe we get would be nice to see strength into that if we could get strength into early September that's when we could start to get defensive and maybe put on some tactical shorts ahead of the election ### MISCELLANEOUS\nand then be positioned and create some extra free cash to ride the year-end postelection rally uh similar to uh 2016 for those of you were who were around only 5% of firms uh currently use AI suggesting limited growth I don't know if I agree with that second part of the statement but I think there is  an overstatement as to the current value uh dividends likely to contribute more than during the past decade so in the past decade dividend return was 16% of Total return price return was 84 but if you go back to 19 36 through now uh dividends represented a third of the returns about 36% of the Returns versus price 64 which is in line with the 493 outperforming because most of them are dividend stocks and you see in our portfolio we have a lot of dividend stocks that have started to do exceptionally well so look at this moving forward China bond yields at all-time lows they're starting to defend this as we said watch this as an indicator for equities to start to turn that 26 to 2018 move 29 to 2011 this needs to turn it will all turn at once this is this is an extreme like we saw in 2020 and you got a monster rally into 2021 as well every time uh we expect another owner's equivalent rent in July fine that's great uh Dallas fed manufacturing this this is where you see the mixed stuff regionally uh excess covid related money has waned inflation should maintain its downward Trend Dallas fed manufacturing expected new orders so current new orders were not good expected new orders are looking really really good this is really coming out of a trough here so it's good to see uh little delinquency rate moving up in credit cards at the lower end of the consumer something to keep an eye on um um so noted and I'm sure the FED is looking at you know we hope the FED is looking at that as well but it's historically low even though it's rising share of households planning to move over the over the next 12 months has increased recently so with expectations of rates coming down I think people are\n\nAmazon uh so we'll see how those come in if those two can bounce even if Nvidia keeps falling uh I think that uh we'll get the bounce in the S&P 500 first time since 2020 that we've seen six straight declines in the 10-year yield of two basis points or more uh so that's that the change in the FED statement here uh leads to September for sure ADP employment I think we're getting close to the end here and then July performance this is very important I just ran these numbers in in advance of going on claiming tomorrow for July the S&P was only up 1% Dow was up 4.5% Russell small caps were up 10.4% and the NASDAQ was down 1.68% small Banks were up 18.6% reats were up 75% utilities were up 7% Industrials were up 5% and mag 7 was down 35 basis points semiconductors were down 5% here's 80% of global Central Bank are expected to be in easing mode by the end of 2024 versus only 10% in July 2023 that's good news but right now Japan is tightening and not enough of the West is uh easing yet so I think you could see some choppiness unless they use other facilities to paper it over until September uh consensus 12-month forward EPS growth projections continue to Trend up across regions that's Asia Pacific Europe and the US that's positive more often than not the s&p500 delivered robust returns following the first fed cut here's the S&P return since 1950 when the US economy did not see a recession within a year of the first Fed rate cut so first month after the average return is negative -3% so we want to keep that in mind as we you know if we show continued strength into mid-september before the FED meeting that will be an opportunity for us to get more defensive raise some cash maybe put on some tactical shorts uh for that month into the election and then two months after you're up on average 7% 3 months after up 10% uh 6 months after 12% 12 months after 15% so I think this time will be similar\n\nthey're cutting a bunch of costs they miss bu a hair um I'll wait and uh listen to the call tonight before we add any shares or make a decision whether we're going to add any shares but we're comfortable with ours if you remember we bought it 25 we sold 2/3 at 20 at 48 and then we re rebuilt the position between 29 and 31 so we've made some money on it the question is do we want to add more back at 25 or 24 wherever is it is after hours and uh after the call I'll make that decision but um uh more likely than not uh I think it it makes sense and uh unless I hear something in the call that's uh egregious but the Legacy business so they Revenue declined by 1% that's not the end of the world um and remember the whole growth story story is the 45 billion of Grants tax breaks and Loans from the US government to to stand up a duopoly with Taiwan semiconductor that all the Western Fortune 500s are going to push their demand through uh due to government pressure so um that's not in the numbers yet Canada Goose reported uh surprising because it surprisingly okay given that it's off seon they were able so the wholesale continues to go down the directed consumer continues to go up which is going to increase margins over time which we like China was up again I was a little worried about China because every other company had china down uh but China was actually up and Asia Pacific was up so those were strong reg regions um uh overall for the company revenues were up a few percent and then their their margins were a little bit worse because they bought a new Factory that they have to take the cost out of so they had some impact but revenues for the quarter were up you know 5% basically uh from 84 to 88 million year on year so uh so the business continues to do well and is what is considered to be a week quarter so I'll listen to that one that one came out today as well Pals TRS and towels\n### MISCELLANEOUS\nstock market and sentiment results\n\n earning here are margins are reaccelerating from the dstock to the restock cycle and then you see uh earnings growth is 9.8 versus 88.9% estimates uh as I said expectations were High secret happiness is low expectations so it's coming in higher but not as high above as it had in previous quarters so you're getting a little chop here and then uh estimates have been a little soft the last few months so we want to see a little re acceleration we saw 1% since the beginning of July let's see if that persists after we get to the end of this week with so many companies having reported so let's get on to uh well first off",
    "MEDIA_APPEARANCE_RECAP": "\n\n### MEDIA_APPEARANCE_RECAP\nlet's get to the markets overview we'll do the media and then we're going to get down to a lot of data a lot of earnings uh this is a catchup I mean I know last week wasn't short but it was shorter than normal so first I want to thank Neil Cavuto and jenet D tomases for having me on Fox Business Cavuto Coast to Coast this week and we're going to listen in now other Thomas I want to go to is Thomas Hayes the chairman of managing member of great Hill Capital Thomas you heard the other Thomas and what he was saying about the environment for this we don't need a cut right now but the markets certainly are anticipating not necessarily from today's meeting uh but Alan ler of course the provides the see they made a credible argument for doing that but but that aside um Market rates are very low it's just looking at a 10e in and out of 4.09% maybe you don't need to do anything maybe the markets are doing the the heavy lifting for the FED what do you think well in anticipation of the cut you do have the FED funds rate over so the 10e yield is compressing and in the event that they walked back the cuts you would see that 10year yield shoot right back up the markets would be down so it's a little bit of uh setting I'm sorry but would that apply if they do nothing in other words if they if they do nothing I guess the big issue today is what they signal or Jerome pal signals when he talks to reporters and if he sets the stage for September cut how do the markets deal with that yeah I think that's baked into the markets right now I think the surprise would be if he said maybe September is not on the table the markets would react but you're seeing it look the rotation has begun July was a turning point we saw the dramatic rotation in anticipation of one cut in September and possibly another in December so the market likes that the the market is acting accordingly but what's interesting is Tech and communication Services up to this point for the month of July were negative while Banks were up 16% real estate was up 7% utilities was up 5% so this is kind of baked into the market at present um let's talk technology real quickly Thomas I mean what what what the market taketh away give it back with a vengeance and Microsoft is getting the credit for this even though its numbers uh failed to impress especially its Cloud database and business and all the rest but the fact of the matter was it did indicate it's spending a heck of a lot of money on artificial intelligence and every facet that was deemed along with the AMD news as a sign that you know uh this this AI spending is still strong and it's lifting all the chip makers so how do you interpret that how how long live do you see this play it out for me yeah well Neil we have an AI arms race between Microsoft Google and Amazon and the AI arms dealers are the short-term winners Nvidia uh Intel and AMD but I think that's going to change so like you said Microsoft's capex was up 7 7.6% while their revenues were only up 15% seoa wrote an article about a month ago called the $600 billion question and basically what they said was uh given the amount of capex that these companies are spending on GPU chips they would need another 600 billion and we're back then I want to thank Melanie schaer of ceo.ca it's out of Toronto for doing a long form interview with me that gives you some context as to what's happening under the surface so we'll listen in [Music] now I'm excited to be joined today by Thomas Hayes chairman and managing member great Hill Capital how are you doing today Tom doing great Mel thanks for having me so we're talking during a huge week for the market the US Federal Reserve is meeting as we speak into tomorrow the central bank will announce its decision on interest rates we also have four companies within the Magnificent Seven reporting earnings we'll get into the rotation that you've been calling for for a long time in a minute but what should investors expect to see from these earnings and the guidance that's issued and will the FED cut rates tomorrow the million dooll question will the FED Cut Rate tomorrow well look I think just as important as the fed's decision is more importantly is actually the bank of Japan because we've had this theme Mel where Bank of Japan has been the global liquidity provider with unlimited quantitative easing not only buying jgbs uh and us treasuries but actually buying domestic and Global equities well that that is uh gig is up and they are now in a tightening period they' wanted inflation for many years they now have it and uh all bets are on that they could be raising rates almost as we speak I know their meeting is happening and and we'll know in the next 24 hours so as they start to withdraw that liquidity from Global markets the pressure is on the fed and the ECB to now step in and uh be a global provider of liquidity I know there are some Traders and investors who think tomorrow uh and this week may be a live meeting for the fed the odds don't favorite uh chair Powell other than his autopilot debacle in December of 2018 uh prefers not to shock the market or surprise the market so my sense is uh it's it's going to be February where uh excuse me in September where consensus current currently is that the first cut will be in September uh based on you know Dudley coming out and a couple of others and some of the weakness that we're seeing in the employment stats it wouldn't be unjustified to cut tomorrow but I think they have not done a good job of preparing the market if that was their intention and therefore we think September is going to be the base case for the first cut and December the second cut and what about for the big Tech earnings coming out this week yeah you know the the big thing here seoa put out a great uh white paper a few weeks ago called the $600 billion do question and what they basically said was all the cap backs that we're seeing on AI chips uh and semiconductors uh is is fine except for the fact that it would require $600 billion of new Revenue to justify the cost and they break down SAS margins and uh Etc and what we saw with alphabet was a concerning Trend where the capex was was very high and the revenues were not yet nearly supportive to justify that capex and you've effectively had an arms race with all of big big Tech trying to hoard as many high-end chips as they possibly could as quickly as they could so that their competition didn't have it but there the revenues that support that level of spend are nowhere to be found so there's a there's a fear about margins there's a fear about how long will it take if ever to fill that $600 billion Revenue hole commencer it with the capex bend that we've seen uh and the front loading of the the chip hoarding so you know I think that big Tech and magn 7 have come in a reasonable amount but it wouldn't surprise me look I would say this it would surprise me if this was another 2000 Tech wre I don't see that coming because these are huge free cash flow generators which was not the case in 2000 so I wouldn't compare it to that uh but I think prospectively certainly for the next 9 to 18 months we should see a scenario where irrespective of tomorrow's earnings or or the day after's earnings where the mag magnificent 7 as a basket underperforms the unmagnify I.E the second half of the year we should see more subdued General indices because of the weights of magnificent 7 within the market cap weight indices and uh huge monstrous opportunities under the surface for the Left Behind stocks I mean you saw a couple today that we've talked a lot about on our podcast and and in public uh TV appearances you know PayPal is up uh seven eight percent today on beating earnings Stanley Black and Decker talk about old world uh is up seven or eight% on beating earnings so there's a lot of great stuff happening under the surface that gets no\n\num for growth and that's why we think this this one as well could be double double plus over the next handful of years uh and a huge track record of success and a huge total addressable Market of 430 billion which they've only got about 5% they're the second largest player basically a duopoly with DHL and a fragmented business and uh and huge huge open space for them to grow and lastly Tom um just because we're running out of time and I know this isn't your favorite thing to talk about but as the US election cycle continues to heat up can you tell us what the stock market wants to see in terms of who ends up in the White House and which party or parties take control of the house and the Senate yeah that's a fair question look I I think at the end of the day uh empirically speaking what's worked historically is when no party controls all three branches so the worst case scenario would be if you have either uh all Democratic executive Senate and House or an all Republican executive Senate and House that's bad for the stock market bad meaning it will perform less well than when you have a situation of gridlock where one party controls at least one of those three branches and that's effectively what we want to see whether you're on the right side of of of the spectrum or the left side what you should be hopeful for is that your party does not win all three branches if you own stocks because what works best is gridlock the market likes when politicians are limited in their ability to get stuff done because the more they do the worse it tends to get so we'll leave it at that and uh and let's hope for gridlock and and whomever uh you hope uh gains the executive branch uh just just be hopeful that uh they're checked in Congress it's definitely going to be interesting there's lots to watch over the uh days and weeks ahead yeah again Thomas Hayes chairman and managing member great Hill Capital thanks again for joining us Tom thanks m ### MEDIA_APPEARANCE_RECAP\nfinally  I want to thank uh Sean calebs and Ryan Gallagher uh for having me on cgtn America last night to talk about the fed's uh developments we'll listen in now well what the FED does or doesn't do is always big news for talk more about this latest decision on interest rates and what it's going to mean for the US economy moving forward let's bring in Thomas Hayes Thomas is of course the founder and chairman and managing member of great Hill Capital LLC uh a long short Equity manager based in New York City Thomas always a pleasure great to have you back thanks for having me Sean okay let's dissect what Jerome pal had to say uh really no surprise as our John ter just told us that there wasn't a drop in interest rates today but your thoughts on the language that he used about a potential cut in September saying it will be on the table so do markets build in that they're expecting this cut and then if it does or doesn't happen what are we looking for the next eight weeks well Sean I think the market is already built it in uh fed funds Futures had been pricing nearly 100% chance of the first cut in September and what we saw in the month of July was that the great rotation in anticipation of that began in Earnest as a matter of fact if you look at as of this morning you had Tech and Communications services for the month of July were nearly flat were a little bit negative might have closed barely positive but Banks were up 16% on the month real estate was up 6.9% utilities was up 5% uh equal weighted uh S&P was up 5% whereas the cap weighted the normal S&P 500 was only up about 1% uh maybe a little bit more at the close and then small caps were up 10 10% so the market has already started to get ahead of this and the language as you stated Sean did in fact change to be more predictive that he is moving ahead as a matter of fact there were a few fed members he he alluded to that wanted to go in July wow okay so to talk more about what happened what areas of the economy is the US winning uh the fight against inflation in because that obviously is going to be first second third fourth fifth on the list uh leading them to make that decision one way or the other well we're seeing disinflation so we saw McDonald's for example had uh sales down 1% the big two things that have been holding up inflation were auto insurance and auto prices which have started to come down and owners equivalent rent which has been on a lagged basis which has also started to show some signs of weakness uh wages grew at just 0.8% in the second quarter so that was the softest since 2020 so everything is showing signs of disinflation but he did emphasize the Dual mandate and he started to make the case again that he was focusing just as much on inflation as now he is focused on employment he doesn't want to see material cracks in or weakening in the labor market which he's focused on like a hawk which uh you know just a month or two months ago he was only focused on inflation so this is a key turning point and he's seeing what the Market's seeing and that is he's going to have to move uh pretty quickly certainly in September as a matter of fact city was out today saying they start in September and they go all the way down to 3 and a half% which would be you know four or five consecutive Cuts in a row wow that'd be interesting now also uh we've heard the FED talk about it's important to not act too soon but you certainly don't want to act too late which is what you're talking about right now so if the economy is moving moving closer to its 2% inflation Target uh but there's still no question that consumers are feeling the bite you talked about some but people still grousing obviously about grocery prices housing uh talk about some of the problem areas and the frustration that people deal with day in and day out yeah there's no question I mean the real issue is incomes have actually risen slightly faster than overall inflation but it hurts people at the lower end because inflation is taxation without representation is basically what it comes down to it hits everyone and it hits people with the lowest discretionary income the hardest people that have to pay for regular Necessities food gasoline Etc on a daily basis rent on a daily basis uh and those prices unfortunately are not going back to pre-pandemic levels the best we can hope for is that they go down to increasing by 2% a year which is the goal but the FED has indicated they have to move before that Target is hit otherwise you run the risk of deflation and you know the key thing\n\n### MEDIA_APPEARANCE_RECAP\nMarket's doing well uh now if there's a cut in September and another at the uh end of the year tell us what you believe is going to happen to the markets and if that doesn't happen what's going to happen to the markets well I think you shouldn't think about a retirement account in a quarterly basis you should think of it in years uh however it would be natural to see some short-term volatility ahead of the election which is you know late September early October and that just happens to line up with the FED meeting on the 17th 18 so coincident or causal it wouldn't surprise me if we see some continued strength uh over the next few weeks and then some some fall volatility uh along the lines of the election and or the FED meeting in September it could be and a lot of people are pointing to it could be a shortterm sell the news before a year-end uh rally that would not in fact surprise me at all but I but I wouldn't stay short too long because I think think after you get the certainty around the election regardless of who is elected you're going to see a rally into year end as the market absorbs all the new news so what we like to do over here at Great Hill capital is buy high quality companies when they're on sale and hold on to them for a while\n### QUOTES_OF_THE_WEEK\nBen Graham's teacher said quote individuals who cannot Master their emotions are ill suited to profit from the investment process so on months where everything that you own is up like crazy uh it's easy to think you're a genius but you have to keep an eye on the underlying fundamentals of the business and then in days when things are down dramatically you say to yourself okay what's changed about xyz's ability to sell X and if nothing's changed then you ignore the short-term volatility\n### HEADLINES_AND_NEWS\nDudley citing growing recession risk urges fed to cut rates as soon as what would have been yesterday um Jeffrey gunak who runs double line a huge bond shop I think 80 billion under management uh also said the FED should have cut yesterday and then when we saw the weak employment data this morning which kind of threw the market into a tizzy uh people started saying they should have Jeremy seagull was out saying 50 basis points is not off the table for September so they might have to play a little catchup I think they'll be going uh be okay going in September let's see the numbers tomorrow the good news is earnings are still holding up well which will buy them enough time but I think if they go much later than September they're going to get a hard landing and um he couldn't say it any more clearly which is you know to gun laak's point if you're going to say that you're going in September just go just go now like what's the difference of seven or eight weeks um the key thing that's happening under the surface that no one's really talking about in the US aggressively is that Japan has been a Global liquidity provider for 2 years while the rest of the world was tightening and now they've moved abruptly into being a liquidity extractor by tightening and starting to discontinue their quantitative easing and what is a seamless transition would be if the FED started easing at the same time that Japan was tightening but since there's a 6 we 8we window that that's not the case we could see uh issues with short-term liquidity and that will\n\n### MEDIA_APPEARANCE_RECAP\nfinally\n\n### MEDIA_APPEARANCE_RECAP\nwhat I was trying to talk to uh Neil Cavuto about was that you've got an AI arms race between Microsoft Google and Amazon uh and the arms dealers look like they're winning which is Invidia AMD and Intel in the short term but I think you're going to see um couple of the things is that you've got like you saw AMD earnings were good because demand for their gpus went up so not everyone wants only um Nvidia and if you saw meta's report yeah they were going to have like 100,000 uh h100s but then another 350,000 uh other gpus which you know other is could be Intel as we know the gouty 3 is 50% faster 50% cheaper and uses 40% less energy which is a huge operating cost for these data centers for the hyperscalers so um so I think nvidia's margin is going to be Intel opportunity and then Microsoft Google and Amazon in short term are going to have declining margins as they continue aggressive cap X until the shareholders stop them but seoa put out the key article which was the $600 billion question which says that the amount that they're spending right now is not even remotely justified by earnings so their margins are going to crash and that's why you see the decelerating earnings in that group and that they're uh stock started to um move down okay\n### FEATURED_COMPANY_DEEP_DIVES\nPayPal update so they had their best transaction margin dollar growth since 2021 they raised their 2024 guidance and increased the share repurchase they're coming from a position of strength so so what does that mean the most important thing that came out of this call is that they said uh we're not going to do $5 billion of free cash flow this year we're actually going to do $6 billion of free cash flow this year and you can't give away the stock it's mind-boggling oh and by the way we're not going to buy $5 billion of stock back uh this year like we did last year we're going to buy $6 billion back of stock uh which means you're going to own a bigger slice of the pie without putting any new money out of pocket revenues were up 8% transaction margin dollars were up 8% year on year operating income was up 17% year on year operating margin expanded 126 basis points EPS increased 177% that's a Growth Company ladies and gentlemen uh not a value trap that's a Growth Company total payment volume up 11% payment transactions 8% they even re accelerated active accounts uh by almost 2 million SE qu qually from last quarter to this quarter and generated 1.4 billion of free cash flow in this quarter alone they've got $18 billion of cash by the way uh net cash about 6 billion 12 billion of debt returned 1.5 billion to stockholders buying 24 million shares of common stock at low prices by the way which is when you want them to buy it which is the name of the game so you can see here every metric basically up margins up revenues up transactions up share count collapsing went from in uh 2023 uh 1.1 billion to uh just over 1.04 billion so they've taken out you know 6 60 million shares give or take no 60 58 78 million shares I mean that's pretty awesome and that's going to go down they're going to be below a billion shares which is pretty exciting um all right then you got uh adjusted free cash flow active accounts were up 2 million sequentially um transactions per active account up 11% driven by brain free transaction growth which is what everyone hated because it brought the overall margins and take rate down now that's reaccelerating remember fast lane increased conversion from 50% to 880 % that's rolling out in Earnest the second half that's going to be huge for the company their ad business is rolling out they just did a deal with door Dash and others uh then you've got uh their guidance they took up not only on free cash flow and BuyBacks but they took up their transaction um margin dollars uh from before slightly positive to low to mid single digit growth for fiscal year 2024 for uh non-gaap non-transaction operating expenses then you've got effective tax rate that's not a big deal EPS they went from mid to high single digigit growth to low to mid teens growth that is a monstrous difference and then they took up their Gap EPS to 388 to 398 range from 365 which is another huge jump and then free cash flow and share repurchase so it's huge absolutely hug huge venmo momentum continues to build in monthly active accounts increased across PayPal and venmo fast lane and ads platform is a big deal deal uh expand our addressable Market turn into a growth company which is a big deal deepening our partnership they're doing a huge deal with meta okay so one great meta which we already partner with on multiple fronts PayPal is a top payment method for advertisers and consumers globally across meta family of apps meta dominations and charitable giving campaigns now run on on PayPal giving fund platform meta pays out creators and developers using hyperwallet and meta uses brain tree for credit card processing meta is Facebook and Instagram for those of you and WhatsApp we are working closely with meta to optimize the experiences and look forward to deepening our partnership with meta in mutually beneficial ways in months and years ahead foundation for our next phase of growth they also did a renewed our contract with door Dash to expand how we work together Beyond unbranded PSP processing and offering our branded marks door Dash also relies on our risk capabilities to mitigate losses they will be participating with our new ads platform and remember that changed the game for Amazon when they added the ads business and for Uber uh margin of creative helping us to more profitable Dynamic we expect fast lane generally available in the US in the second half of the year so and by the way they're putting ascribing zero to their guidance raise to the benefits that fast Lane's going to bring to their margin which are going to be off the charts fast lane will accelerate PayPal's ability to capture roughly 60% share of e-commerce purchases made without a branded Mark best-in-class checkout experience in the second quarter we launched inapp offers with Major Brands including Best Buy Price Line lyt instacart Ticket Master Walmart and Nordstrom um redesigned vating payment page alone shows a conversion lift of 75 to 111 basis points in fact we drove almost 20 million app logins from our postp purchase experiences in June alone growing More than 70% from a year ago turning to venmo we're building on the business's strong Market position in the second quarter venmo process more than 73\nbillion in total payment volume growing 8% year-over-year with monthly active increasing 5% year over year to nearly 62 million both a strong base of peer-to-peer users and Adoption of our ecosystem of products are driving this growth for example both venmo debit card and pay with venmo monthly active users grew 30% uh we launched a push provisioning of the venmo debit card to Apple and Google wallets and continue to enable PayPal pay with venmo with merchants and partners including eBay and StubHub recently launched venmo teen venmo is primed for growth making it easier to add PayPal and venmo branded cards to Apple and Google Wallets on mobile devices etc etc so uh we were encouraged to see the sustained total active account growing growth following a positive inflection in the first quarter so they went from Contracting to expansion that's what you want to see at inflection points um transactions per active account which is a triling 12mth number with 60.9 in the second quarter up 11% transactions per active account grew 6% total payment volume grew 11% uh and total payment volume International also grew 11% Etc so there's just unbelievable things happening since this guy took over PayPal generated 1.4 billion in free cash flow 1.5 billion in share purchases bringing repurchases to 5 billion raising our guidance uh re accelerating durable profitable growth for the company given the strong start to the year we are raising our free cash flow guidance we covered that grew profitably venmo customers venmo ecosystem fast lane conversion from 50 to 80% we covered ### FEATURED_COMPANY_DEEP_DIVES\nStanley Black and Decker so I mean these have these things are starting to move Stanley Black and& Decker up from 77 to $107 in the last you know month uh that's a pretty big move um basically they had lower inventory destocking uh costs which is going to lead to restocking like we've said uh change supply chain transformation benefits and reduce shipping costs they should just Outsource the gxo by the way uh on track for expected pre-tax run rate Savings of 1.5 billion by the end of 2024 they've already done 1.3 and two billion by the end of 2025 I think we had done the math on that and uh it was like it was worth like $80 a share at at the normal historic multiple and that excludes the business but anyway let's just stick to the facts here uh organic Revenue growth led by DeWalt which is good gross margin was up 600 basis points to 28.4 their goal is to get to 30 back to 35% which they will um cash from operating activities was 573 million free cash flow was 486 million that's what you want to see in a turnaround story they have Runway uh they raise their earnings guidance to a basically 8040 basically 410 midpoint from a 4.0 midpoint so 370 to 450 from 350 to 450 and they raised their free cash flow to uh 750 million midpoint from a $700 million midpoint so that's huge uh supply chain improvements volume growth reaccelerating all the things you want to hear uh Cost Cuts in and then getting back to growth and getting getting revenues growing again so they're focused on all of it 3M again huge move here since February or or last you know if you go into the fall remember the last quarter we had that huge run from 68 to 90 then it checked back to 74 it's gone from 74 to 128 in the last four months this one's a beast plus we also got svent for free uh with the spin-off so uh you know these things take time but when they go they go all at once um so their organic growth was up modestly their Gap EPS was up 117% adjusted EPS up 39% operating CA uh cash flow a billion adjusted free cash flow was 1.2 billion so they free cash flow generative and they are uh increasing their guidance from [Music] a 705 midpoint to a 715 midpoint which is really good uh and everything's hitting on all cylinders again new CEO new jockey turnaround story and things moving in the right direction they returned 786 million to shareholders via dividends and share repurchases um and moved up their end point so you can go through some of these on the different divisions whether it's safety and Industrial Transportation Electronics consumer full year guidance they took their adjusted operating margin up uh from a 237 bips midpoint increased to a 250 bip so they're they're they're going faster than they expected which is a good thing and uh all is in place so they've talked about spinning out the business all the things that they've already accomplished and uh strong balance sheet we repurchased about 400 million of stock in the second quarter have the capacity to do more in the second half of next year they're going to do Acquisitions I'll be taking a fresh dispassionate look not only at am m&a but uh at our portfolio to determine if there's any asss that have greater value owned by others along the same line what assets might be a good fit for 3M I don't have anything to say on that yet so he's he's doing a portfolio management which is a good thing ### MACRO_DATA_SLIDES\nmoving on retail earnings top 30 weights of the sector uh estimates were revised up for next year by three bips down for this year by 62 bips transports were both both revised down for this year and next year 340 bips and 360 bips so you have to keep an eye on it my guess is that's skewed to one company though so Uber uh has come down uh no let's see here let's see where the big hit was FedEx a little bit oh probably UPS where's UPS yeah UPS was a big contributor to that um s a a and those look like the the big ones all right ### HEADLINES_AND_NEWS\nuh tomorrow we've got uh the jobs report expected private non-farm payrolls expected to be plus 176 um we probably want to see a bit lower than 176 uh in order to keep the September guarantee on the table but not so much more that people panic that there's no back stop before September so uh you don't want to see a a super low number also watch the revisions downward and then",
    "FEATURED_COMPANY_DEEP_DIVES": "\n\n earnings growth next year and their 12% this year so uh it's not a hope or a wish uh the only thing that could change that thesis would be a dramatic change in earnings expectations for small caps versus large caps caps and so far we're not seeing that so far it's actually right on schedule and uh and we're going to see more of that I I think in the last few days or so where you saw little hiccup when kamla was announced as the candidate you saw teex start to take off and uh the unmagnify uh take a little rest but I think that was also a function of they mooved so far so fast I think it was something like 133% in a week and a half small caps as a basket moved it was just an excuse to rest so irrespective of the president uh who's elected Etc I think this this trend is going to persist because the composition and the cost of capital cycle supports it well the Russell 2000 is up about 11% since the second quarter ended now how should investors be positioning themselves for a longer term shift and what data should they be paying particular attention to yeah I think a couple of things are are going going to take place number one the UNM magnificent 493 so there will be large caps that do extremely well that have lagged the non non magnificent 7 then you've got anything interest rate sensitive so dividend Growers Stanley Black and& Decker is a great example of that um cyclicals REITs are another one that have been left for dead they're the most under owned since 2009 everyone's calling for commercial real estate uh apocalypse we think there t### FEATURED_COMPANY_DEEP_DIVES\nhere is  some truth to that but it's Mo mostly going to be in the B and C Properties this is analogous analogous to the mall uh debacle you know four or five years ago where the a malls wound up doing better you know the the Simon properties of the world that have Lululemon and Apple Stores and all the things that people want to go to and then the BNC malls that were anchored by JC Penney and Sears uh had been a train wreck I I think this it will be similar for commercial office uh I think there's a little bit of froth in the multifam uh in in certain areas in the country we'll see some of that but I think it'll be a slow motion unwind and lenders incentivized to extend and pretend so it won't be an acute abrupt type of uh pop it will be more of a slow leakage uh that can be contained and the rest of the market can pick up the slack the other thing that's happening in the same at the same time Mel that few people are focused on is we have been in a dramatic recession for the last two years it's just been contained well it started with the two quarters of negative GDP growth uh and and uh in 2002 first quarter second quarter uh and it was supported by a massive manufacturing slowdown the destocking cycle that has now bottomed and is starting to turn up we're starting to see more positive signs slowly green shoots where manufacturing is coming back and we're certainly seeing very green Shoots for the destocking cycle being in the rear view mirror and the restocking cycle just starting and that's not the time that you hit tops in markets or ends of Cycles that's more the time when you hit second legs uh and refreshes a cycle and that's what we're starting to see right now as evidenced in uh Stanley Black and Decker is a great example of that this morning they they spent eight quarters destocking and now they're restocking their free cash flows going through the roof uh they paid down a bunch of debt they've taken the costs out and we're seeing that among all many of the the unmagnify can you give us a rundown of three stocks that you're bullish on into the end of the year yeah I can I can do that for sure I I we love PayPal we've lik that for a while it's been dead money for a number of months uh but I think today was the Breakthrough quarter uh we saw earn we saw the revenues were up 8% their earnings were up 177% their payment volume was up 11% their free cash flow for the quarter was 1.4 billion I mean how many turnaround quote unquote turnaround situations do you see that they're generating six6 billion dollars of cash per year and you can't give the stock away so uh uh and their margins are coming back so they they not only took guidance up they said by the way we're not going to do five billion of free cash flow we're going to do six billion of free cash flow oh and by the way uh remember how we said we're going to buy back $5 billion worth of stock this year yeah we changed our mind we're going to buy back $ billion worth of stock this year so Alex Chris who came from into it he ran the small business division which was responsible for 50% of the revenues of a of a stock that went up you know 20s something times during his tenure 20x plus uh has taken the Reigns of PayPal and he laid out his plan earlier this year it fell flat but he's executing and we saw that and we're seeing the the movement in the stock price today and we believe it's just the beginning of many good things to come uh on PayPal and then uh Stanley Black and Decker as I said they sold a non-core business paid down $1.2 billion of debt their their cost reduction plan to cut $2 billion doll of costs by the end of 2025 is almost 75% done they've taken nearly $1.5 billion of cost out of the business the business is inflection they inflecting they have uh DeWalt they have Craftsman they have Stanley they have black and& Decker so if you believe in construction and you believe in manufacturing and you believe there's going to be an increased demand for tools and you believe in the housing shortage and you believe that uh that the Millennials are going to continue housing formation for the next five years you want to own Stanley Black and& Decker or at least we own it you should do whatever you want to do uh opinion not advice then you know we like you know as you can tell we like durable businesses that are temporarily out of favor we like Disney okay you can't give Disney stock away they just had their greatest box office of a R-rated movie in history uh with Deadpool and Wolverine I I didn't get a chance to see it but uh I guess I'll have to now as an owner of the business and uh and we look at the sum of the parts and what's what's fascinating about Disney there's so much pessimism and noise around Disney but if you do the sum of the parts the parks and the experiences and the consumer products do about 10 billion of eida it's probably a little bit more now so that's worth about $80 a share okay as of a couple of days ago the stock was trading around $9 a share it's bumped up a little bit since the weekend still incredibly cheap what that means is effectively the market is assigning zero value to Disney plus which has 100 53 million subscriptions uh ESPN which is the number one sports property in the world and currently gaining share not losing share you've got Hulu you've got the T TV networks and you have the movie theatrical releases like we saw this weekend and we saw with inside out to which was a huge success uh that's that's going to be another multi-billion dollar Blockbuster and the market is currently assigning for all of those those pieces of the business mail you're the market is assigning zero do of value those business on a normalized run rate are going to do 15 billion of ebit We Believe which implies that the stock could over the next three to five years in our in our opinion could uh be $180 to $200 stock so basically a double uh over a few years as the market starts to recognize that and that's not like wish or hope if you look at Netflix it's got 270 some odd million uh users and they get about a quarter of a billion dollars worth of value attributed to to the value of those uh subscribers so even if you say well Disney are only worth half as much there's a hundred some odd billion dollars that's not not yet priced into the stock we think there's tremendous opportunity and then\n\nokay you can't give Disney stock away they just had their greatest box office of a R-rated movie in history uh with Deadpool and Wolverine I I didn't get a chance to see it but uh I guess I'll have to now as an owner of the business and uh and we look at the sum of the parts and what's what's fascinating about Disney there's so much pessimism and noise around Disney but if you do the sum of the parts the parks and the experiences and the consumer products do about 10 billion of eida it's

get about a quarter of a billion dollars worth of value attributed to to the value of those uh subscribers so even if you say well Disney are only worth half as much there's a hundred some odd billion dollars that's not not yet priced into the stock we think there's tremendous opportunity and then\n### FEATURED_COMPANY_DEEP_DIVES\nfinally  is a boring business called gxo Logistics this is one of Brad Jacobs companies and Brad Jacobs has the mightest touch he's done uh if you had invested a million with him when he he got involved with United Rentals you would have made 47 times your money over a number of years if you had gotten involved with xbo Logistics in 2010 when he got involved you would have made 31 times your money so a million becomes 31 million and gxo Logistics was spun out of xbo they do Outsource Logistics supply chain uh reverse Logistics uh order fulfillment Etc and uh they have guided that they're going to nearly double A adjusted iida by 2027 which implies you could get nearly a double in the stock except for the fact that when your growth rate accelerates as it will with these uh assimilations of some recent acquisitions that they've done not only do you get the the doubling in terms of uh stock price you get some multiple expansion as they start growing and continue to grow Top Line and bottom line by double digits the market will pay a premium for growth and that's why we think this this one as well could be double double plus over the next handful of years uh and a huge track record of success and a huge total addressable Market of 430 billion which they've only got about 5% they're the second largest player basically a duopoly with DHL and a fragmented business and uh and huge huge open space for them to grow and lastly Tom um just because we're running out of time and I know this isn't your favorite thing to talk about but as the US election cycle continues to heat up can you tell us what the stock market wants to see in terms of who ends up in the White House and which party or parties take control of the house and the Senate yeah that's a fair question look I I think at the end of the day uh empirically speaking what's worked historically is when no party controls all three branches so the worst case scenario would be if you have either uh all Democratic executive Senate and House or an all Republican executive Senate and House that's bad for the stock market bad meaning it will perform less well than when you have a situation of gridlock where one party controls at least one of those three branches and that's effectively what we want to see whether you're on the right side of of of the spectrum or the left side what you should be hopeful for is that your party does not win all three branches if you own stocks because what works best is gridlock the market likes when politicians are limited in their ability to get stuff done because the more they do the worse it tends to get so we'll leave it at that and uh and let's hope for gridlock and and whomever uh you hope uh gains the executive branch uh just just be hopeful that uh they're checked in Congress it's definitely going to be interesting there's lots to watch over the uh days and weeks ahead yeah again Thomas Hayes chairman and managing member great Hill Capital thanks again for joining us Tom thanks m [Music] [Applause] and we're back and then\n\n### MEDIA_APPEARANCE_RECAP\nwhat I was trying to talk to uh Neil Cavuto about was that you've got an AI arms race between Microsoft Google and Amazon uh and the arms dealers look like they're winning which is Invidia AMD and Intel in the short term but I think you're going to see um couple of the things is that you've got like you saw AMD earnings were good because demand for their gpus went up so not everyone wants only um Nvidia and if you saw meta's report yeah they were going to have like 100,000 uh h100s but then another 350,000 uh other gpus which you know other is could be Intel as we know the gouty 3 is 50% faster 50% cheaper and uses 40% less energy which is a huge operating cost for these data centers for the hyperscalers so um so I think nvidia's margin is going to be Intel opportunity and then Microsoft Google and Amazon in short term are going to have declining margins as they continue aggressive cap X until the shareholders stop them but seoa put out the key article which was the $600 billion question which says that the amount that they're spending right now is not even remotely justified by earnings so their margins are going to crash and that's why you see the decelerating earnings in that group and that they're uh stock started to um move down okay\n### FEATURED_COMPANY_DEEP_DIVES\nPayPal update so they had their best transaction margin dollar growth since 2021 they raised their 2024 guidance and increased the share repurchase they're coming from a position of strength so so what does that mean the most important thing that came out of this call is that they said uh we're not going to do $5 billion of free cash flow this year we're actually going to do $6 billion of free cash flow this year and you can't give away the stock it's mind-boggling oh and by the way we're not going to buy $5 billion of stock back uh this year like we did last year we're going to buy $6 billion back of stock uh which means you're going to own a bigger slice of the pie without putting any new money out of pocket revenues were up 8% transaction margin dollars were up 8% year on year operating income was up 17% year on year operating margin expanded 126 basis points EPS increased 177% that's a Growth Company ladies and gentlemen uh not a value trap that's a Growth Company total payment volume up 11% payment transactions 8% they even re accelerated active accounts uh by almost 2 million SE qu qually from last quarter to this quarter and generated 1.4 billion of free cash flow in this quarter alone they've got $18 billion of cash by the way uh net cash about 6 billion 12 billion of debt returned 1.5 billion to stockholders buying 24 million shares of common stock at low prices by the way which is when you want them to buy it which is the name of the game so you can see here every metric basically up margins up revenues up transactions up share count collapsing went from in uh 2023 uh 1.1 billion to uh just over 1.04 billion so they've taken out you know 6 60 million shares give or take no 60 58 78 million shares I mean that's pretty awesome and that's going to go down they're going to be below a billion shares which is pretty exciting um all right then you got uh adjusted free cash flow active accounts were up 2 million sequentially um transactions per active account up 11% driven by brain free transaction growth which is what everyone hated because it brought the overall margins and take rate down now that's reaccelerating remember fast lane increased conversion from 50% to 880 % that's rolling out in Earnest the second half that's going to be huge for the company their ad business is rolling out they just did a deal with door Dash and others uh then you've got uh their guidance they took up not only on free cash flow and BuyBacks but they took up their transaction um margin dollars uh from before slightly positive to low to mid single digit growth for fiscal year 2024 for uh non-gaap non-transaction operating expenses then you've got effective tax rate that's not a big deal EPS they went from mid to high single digigit growth to low to mid teens growth that is a monstrous difference and then they took up their Gap EPS to 388 to 398 range from 365 which is another huge jump and then free cash flow and share repurchase so it's huge absolutely hug huge venmo momentum continues to build in monthly active accounts increased across PayPal and venmo fast lane and ads platform is a big deal deal uh expand our addressable Market turn into a growth company which is a big deal deepening our partnership they're doing a huge deal with meta okay so one great meta which we already partner with on multiple fronts PayPal is a top payment method for advertisers and consumers globally across meta family of apps meta dominations and charitable giving campaigns now run on on PayPal giving fund platform meta pays out creators and developers using hyperwallet and meta uses brain tree for credit card processing meta is Facebook and Instagram for those of you and WhatsApp we are working closely with meta to optimize the experiences and look forward to deepening our partnership with meta in mutually beneficial ways in months and years ahead foundation for our next phase of growth they also did a renewed our contract with door Dash to expand how we work together Beyond unbranded PSP processing and offering our branded marks door Dash also relies on our risk capabilities to mitigate losses they will be participating with our new ads platform and remember that changed the game for Amazon when they added the ads business and for Uber uh margin of creative helping us to more profitable Dynamic we expect fast lane generally available in the US in the second half of the year so and by the way they're putting ascribing zero to their guidance raise to the benefits that fast Lane's going to bring to their margin which are going to be off the charts fast lane will accelerate PayPal's ability to capture roughly 60% share of e-commerce purchases made without a branded Mark best-in-class checkout experience in the second quarter we launched inapp offers with Major Brands including Best Buy Price Line lyt instacart Ticket Master Walmart and Nordstrom um redesigned vating payment page alone shows a conversion lift of 75 to 111 basis points in fact we drove almost 20 million app logins from our postp purchase experiences in June alone growing More than 70% from a year ago turning to venmo we're building on the business's strong Market position in the second quarter venmo process more than 73\nbillion in total payment volume growing 8% year-over-year with monthly active increasing 5% year over year to nearly 62 million both a strong base of peer-to-peer users and Adoption of our ecosystem of products are driving this growth for example both venmo debit card and pay with venmo monthly active users grew 30% uh we launched a push provisioning of the venmo debit card to Apple and Google wallets and continue to enable PayPal pay with venmo with merchants and partners including eBay and StubHub recently launched venmo teen venmo is primed for growth making it easier to add PayPal and venmo branded cards to Apple and Google Wallets on mobile devices etc etc so uh we were encouraged to see the sustained total active account growing growth following a positive inflection in the first quarter so they went from Contracting to expansion that's what you want to see at inflection points um transactions per active account which is a triling 12mth number with 60.9 in the second quarter up 11% transactions per active account grew 6% total payment volume grew 11% uh and total payment volume International also grew 11% Etc so there's just unbelievable things happening since this guy took over PayPal generated 1.4 billion in free cash flow 1.5 billion in share purchases bringing repurchases to 5 billion raising our guidance uh re accelerating durable profitable growth for the company given the strong start to the year we are raising our free cash flow guidance we covered that grew profitably venmo customers venmo ecosystem fast lane conversion from 50 to 80% we covered ### FEATURED_COMPANY_DEEP_DIVES\nStanley Black and Decker so I mean these have these things are starting to move Stanley Black and& Decker up from 77 to $107 in the last you know month uh that's a pretty big move um basically they had lower inventory destocking uh costs which is going to lead to restocking like we've said uh change supply chain transformation benefits and reduce shipping costs they should just Outsource the gxo by the way uh on track for expected pre-tax run rate Savings of 1.5 billion by the end of 2024 they've already done 1.3 and two billion by the end of 2025 I think we had done the math on that and uh it was like it was worth like $80 a share at at the normal historic multiple and that excludes the business but anyway let's just stick to the facts here uh organic Revenue growth led by DeWalt which is good gross margin was up 600 basis points to 28.4 their goal is to get to 30 back to 35% which they will um cash from operating activities was 573 million free cash flow was 486 million that's what you want to see in a turnaround story they have Runway uh they raise their earnings guidance to a basically 8040 basically 410 midpoint from a 4.0 midpoint so 370 to 450 from 350 to 450 and they raised their free cash flow to uh 750 million midpoint from a $700 million midpoint so that's huge uh supply chain improvements volume growth reaccelerating all the things you want to hear uh Cost Cuts in and then getting back to growth and getting getting revenues growing again so they're focused on all of it 3M again huge move here since February or or last you know if you go into the fall remember the last quarter we had that huge run from 68 to 90 then it checked back to 74 it's gone from 74 to 128 in the last four months this one's a beast plus we also got svent for free uh with the spin-off so uh you know these things take time but when they go they go all at once um so their organic growth was up modestly their Gap EPS was up 117% adjusted EPS up 39% operating CA uh cash flow a billion adjusted free cash flow was 1.2 billion so they free cash flow generative and they are uh increasing their guidance from [Music] a 705 midpoint to a 715 midpoint which is really good uh and everything's hitting on all cylinders again new CEO new jockey turnaround story and things moving in the right direction they returned 786 million to shareholders via dividends and share repurchases um and moved up their end point so you can go through some of these on the different divisions whether it's safety and Industrial Transportation Electronics consumer full year guidance they took their adjusted operating margin up uh from a 237 bips midpoint increased to a 250 bip so they're they're they're going faster than they expected which is a good thing and uh all is in place so they've talked about spinning out the business all the things that they've already accomplished and uh strong balance sheet we repurchased about 400 million of stock in the second quarter have the capacity to do more in the second half of next year they're going to do Acquisitions I'll be taking a fresh dispassionate look not only at am m&a but uh at our portfolio to determine if there's any asss that have greater value owned by others along the same line what assets might be a good fit for 3M I don't have anything to say on that yet so he's he's doing a portfolio management which is a good thing ### MACRO_DATA_SLIDES\nmoving on retail earnings top 30 weights of the sector uh estimates were revised up for next year by three bips down for this year by 62 bips transports were both both revised down for this year and next year 340 bips and 360 bips so you have to keep an eye on it my guess is that's skewed to one company though so Uber uh has come down uh no let's see here let's see where the big hit was FedEx a little bit oh probably UPS where's UPS yeah UPS was a big contributor to that um s a a and those look like the the big ones all right ### HEADLINES_AND_NEWS\nuh tomorrow we've got uh the jobs report expected private non-farm payrolls expected to be plus 176 um we probably want to see a bit lower than 176 uh in order to keep the September guarantee on the table but not so much more that people panic that there's no back stop before September so uh you don't want to see a a super low number also watch the revisions downward and then\n\n### MEDIA_APPEARANCE_RECAP\nwhat I was trying to talk to uh Neil Cavuto about was that you've got an AI arms race between Microsoft

from 68 to 90 then it checked back to 74 it's gone from 74 to 128 in the last four months this one's a beast plus we also got svent for free uh with the spin-off so uh you know these things take time but when they go they go all at once um so their organic growth was up modestly their Gap EPS was up 117% adjusted EPS up 39% operating CA uh cash flow a billion adjusted free cash flow was 1.2 billion so they free cash flow generative and they are uh increasing their guidance from [Music] a 705 midpoint to a 715 midpoint which is really good uh and everything's hitting on all cylinders again new CEO new jockey turnaround story and things moving in the right direction they returned 786 million to shareholders via dividends and share repurchases um and moved up their end point so you can go through some of these on the different divisions whether it's safety and Industrial Transportation Electronics consumer full year guidance they took their adjusted operating margin up uh from a 237 bips midpoint increased to a 250 bip so they're they're they're going faster than they expected which is a good thing and uh all is in place so they've talked about spinning out the business all the things that they've already accomplished and uh strong balance sheet we repurchased about 400 million of stock in the second quarter have the capacity to do more in the second half of next year they're going to do Acquisitions I'll be taking a fresh dispassionate look not only at am m&a but uh at our portfolio to determine if there's any asss that have greater value owned by others along the same line what assets might be a good fit for 3M I don't have anything to say on that yet so he's he's doing a portfolio management which is a good thing ### MACRO_DATA_SLIDES\nmoving on retail earnings top 30 weights of the sector uh estimates were revised up for next year by three bips down for this year by 62 bips transports were both both revised down for this year and next year 340 bips and 360 bips so you have to keep an eye on it my guess is that's skewed to one company though so Uber uh has come down uh no let's see here let's see where the big hit was FedEx a little bit oh probably UPS where's UPS yeah UPS was a big contributor to that um s a a and those look like the the big ones all right ### HEADLINES_AND_NEWS\nuh tomorrow we've got uh the jobs report expected private non-farm payrolls expected to be plus 176 um we probably want to see a bit lower than 176 uh in order to keep the September guarantee on the table but not so much more that people panic that there's no back stop before September so uh you don't want to see a a super low number also watch the revisions downward and then",
    "QUOTES_OF_THE_WEEK": "\n\n### MEDIA_APPEARANCE_RECAP\nMarket's doing well uh now if there's a cut in September and another at the uh end of the year tell us what you believe is going to happen to the markets and if that doesn't happen what's going to happen to the markets well I think you shouldn't think about a retirement account in a quarterly basis you should think of it in years uh however it would be natural to see some short-term volatility ahead of the election which is you know late September early October and that just happens to line up with the FED meeting on the 17th 18 so coincident or causal it wouldn't surprise me if we see some continued strength uh over the next few weeks and then some some fall volatility uh along the lines of the election and or the FED meeting in September it could be and a lot of people are pointing to it could be a shortterm sell the news before a year-end uh rally that would not in fact surprise me at all but I but I wouldn't stay short too long because I think think after you get the certainty around the election regardless of who is elected you're going to see a rally into year end as the market absorbs all the new news so what we like to do over here at Great Hill capital is buy high quality companies when they're on sale and hold on to them for a while\n### QUOTES_OF_THE_WEEK\nBen Graham's teacher said quote individuals who

double line a huge bond shop I think 80 billion under management uh also said the FED should have cut yesterday and then when we saw the weak employment data this morning which kind of threw the market into a tizzy uh people started saying they should have Jeremy seagull was out saying 50 basis points is not off the table for September so they might have to play a little catchup I think they'll be going uh be okay going in September let's see the numbers tomorrow the good news is earnings are still holding up well which will buy them enough time but I think if they go much later than September they're going to get a hard landing and um he couldn't say it any more clearly which is you know to gun laak's point if you're going to say that you're going in September just go just go now like what's the difference of seven or eight weeks um the key thing that's happening under the surface that no one's really talking about in the US aggressively is that Japan has been a Global liquidity provider for 2 years while the rest of the world was tightening and now they've moved abruptly into being a liquidity extractor by tightening and starting to discontinue their quantitative easing and what is a seamless transition would be if the FED started easing at the same time that Japan was tightening but since there's a 6 we 8we window that that's not the case we could see uh issues with short-term liquidity and that will\n\nUK manufacturing recovering that's good for gxo uh UK business activity picks up after pre-election low that's good US dollar Japanese Yen Japanese yen is collapsing as we anticipated it started in July it's absolutely rolling over big time and that's going to be good in time for China it's you know it's taking forever but it's uh all of the pieces of the script that we needed to play out are playing out have we gotten a bazooka no but we've gotten a t ton of uh small shotgun rounds that added together could be the equivalent of a cannon with a time lag and then we're getting the 180 million of new buyers so I love seeing this Yen weekend uh I'm sorry strength in relative to the US dollar that was key to get the hot money flows that came from China to Japan and India everyone thought those were fundamentally based we disagree um uh and as the Yen strengthens we'll see if those hot money flows flow back into China when it happens it happens all at once we got a taste of that with cyclicals and small caps and banks in the month of July they all just went up all at the same time as we had been calling for in the sea change ### QUOTES_OF_THE_WEEK\nearnings this week  night Swift Transportation uh the early signs of Market setting up to change so they the transports have been smoked and now uh they're starting to see some light at the end of the tunnel the other thing that was interesting there were two semiconductor companies I'm trying to remember if it was Qualcomm or nxpi who had like 87% year-on-year growth in semiconductor demand for Autos which is a nice look through for Cooper standard we'll see there was a plant shut down uh in June so you know we time will tell we'll see what the earnings tell us um Texas inum Instruments momentum across all markets United Rentals showing particular strength in manufacturing that's been a key part of our thesis there's been some mixed numbers but I think on balance it's recovering out of a 2-year recession uh Canadian Railways is moving right uh they're they're seeing let's see North America production trending slightly positive um Tesla people are underestimating this demand for grid storage probably by orders of magnitude which helps gener and we saw that uh okay alphabet the risk of underinvestigated the amount that they've been spending hoarding semiconductors uh would have to generate 600 billion of new Revenue in order to maintain margins so what you saw with Microsoft 77% growth in capex and a 15% growth in Revenue means their margins are going to go to hell in the short term which is why this rotation is going to be sustained and you're seeing decelerating earnings growth in uh big Tech and accelerating earnings growth in the unmagnify and small caps um Royal Caribbean robust booking and pricing uh earnings estimates are up 1% since July 1st so so that's a positive thing with um S&P up in aggregate the only group that's down is energy which is kind of interesting uh when you consider the data that just came out we used the most amount of natural gas for energy than we've ever used in history last month so that's positive financials are are the biggest part of the upward revisions we did take some City and Bank of America off in the last week or so um to lock in profits those have been big movers for us and um maybe we can redeploy at lower levels we'll see how that works out but sometimes you got to ring the register uh mentions of weak demand are also and Buffett you saw Buffett out there selling a ton of Bank of America I I don't really pay much attention to that anymore but it's been such aggressive selling uh that it was noted especially when you know they were overbought trading at a premium to book all the things that are the opposite of why I buy but I do want to get back into those because I don't think the banking cycle has even begun yet and um and we've got some still but um less than we did and and booked a nice profit on that if you look at the City chart it was uh a big one for us so okay",

at all all right China's poet burrow meeting sends Positive Vibes to investors after third Plum disappoint Co so that was their kind of backtrack Market didn't really respond because of everything

billion this month so uh most crowded trades are getting liquidated we saw that coming PayPal stock Rises sharply after beat and rais quarter we're going to cover that 3M had its very best day ever\nthe new CEO started with a bang uh we'll cover that in a troubled box office premium still sells that was the biggest R rated movie launch ever uh Deadpool and Wolverine is owned by Marvel owned by Disney uh so that's two monster Blockbusters in the same year markets attributing zero value to that inside out was a billion inside out to was a billion doll uh deal and Deadpool is going to be a

where value is going to out continue to outperform growth PayPal stock stores as earnings bring big positive surprise on this key number what's the key number is transaction margin dollars which was the name of the game game that everyone was worried about and they've turned the corner as anticipated that move is just beginning Bank of England decision another Central Bank Cuts ahead of the FED Disney bets on Deadpool Wolverine and dirty jokes to save Marvel whatever it takes like I told you Bob Iger will play Bible movies 24/7 if it means iida will go back up they learned their lessons they went woke but they don't want to go broke so they're pivoting xbo earnings show us manufacturing improved shares rise fed path for September interest rate cut that's after the fact Tim maros the FED Whisperer wrote that so it's telling us what we already know there's gun laac saying they should have cut yesterday we agree us productivity rebounds sharply in the second quarter which could help a soft Landing so you're seeing all these mixed things there's enough good happening to overcome the FED sucking its thumb but uh if they suck for too long we're going to wind up with uh some issues so uh and it's going to cost them much more go down as one of the worst fed chairs in history versus one of the best and then the difference between those two binary outcomes could be you know two months difference uh or in this case six or eight weeks but I think he can get away with uh sitting on his hands in July but he won't be able to get away with sitting on his hands in September initial jobless claims rise to onee high as hiring slows that's the key message China revs up us up fiscal policy support to Spur economic recovery so they're back back at it can Kelly ortberg turn Boeing around people like him from Rockwell Collins uh he had a huge run with his stock while he was running that I think he's going to do the same for Boeing since 1995 value stocks have always outperformed when they're this cheap by a big margin and uh so we covered these two charts earlier Intel to cut okay so Intel reported after hours their stock is down I want to listen to the call he's going to be on CNBC tomorrow my guess is if he was if it was a disaster he would throw his CFO on instead of himself so he'll he'll be there tomorrow to talk it up but this really does not change the long-term strategy so they're cutting a bunch of costs they miss bu a hair um I'll wait and uh listen to the call tonight before we add any shares or make a decision whether we're going to add any shares but we're comfortable with ours if you remember we bought it 25 we sold 2/3 at 20 at 48 and then we re rebuilt the position between 29 and 31 so we've made some money on it the question is do we want to add more back at 25 or 24 wherever is it is after hours and uh after the call I'll make that decision but um uh more likely than not uh I think it it makes sense and uh unless I hear something in the call that's uh egregious but the Legacy business so they Revenue declined by 1% that's not the end of the world um and remember the whole growth story story is the 45 billion of Grants tax breaks and Loans from the US government to to stand up a duopoly with Taiwan semiconductor that all the Western Fortune 500s are going to push their demand through uh due to government pressure so um that's not in the numbers yet Canada Goose reported uh surprising because it surprisingly okay given that it's off seon they were able so the wholesale continues to go down the directed consumer continues to go up which is going to increase margins over time which we like China was up again I was a little worried about China because every other company had china down uh but China was actually up and Asia Pacific was up so those were strong reg regions um uh overall for the company revenues were up a few percent and then their their margins were a little bit worse because they bought a new Factory that they have to take the cost out of so they had some impact but revenues for the quarter were up you know 5% basically uh from 84 to 88 million year on year so uh so the business continues to do well and is what is considered to be a week quarter so I'll listen to that one that one came out today as well Pals TRS and towels\n\n### HEADLINES_AND_NEWS\nstock market and sentiment results\n\n### MEDIA_APPEARANCE_RECAP\nwhat I was trying to talk to uh Neil Cavuto about was that you've got an AI arms race between Microsoft Google and Amazon uh and the arms dealers look like they're winning which is Invidia AMD and Intel in the short term but I think you're going to see um couple of the things is that you've got like you saw AMD earnings were good because demand for their gpus went up so not everyone wants only um Nvidia and if you saw meta's report yeah they were going to have like 100,000 uh h100s but then another 350,000 uh other gpus which you know other is could be Intel as we know the gouty 3 is 50% faster 50% cheaper and uses 40% less energy which is a huge operating cost for these data centers for the hyperscalers so um so I think nvidia's margin is going to be Intel opportunity and then Microsoft Google and Amazon in short term are going to have declining margins as they continue aggressive cap X until the shareholders stop them but seoa put out the key article which was the $600 billion question which says that the amount that they're spending right now is not even remotely justified by earnings so their margins are going to crash and that's why you see the decelerating earnings in that group and that they're uh stock started to um move down okay\n### FEATURED_COMPANY_DEEP_DIVES\nPayPal update so they had their best transaction margin dollar growth since 2021 they raised their 2024 guidance and increased the share repurchase they're coming from a position of strength so so what does that mean the most important thing that came out of this call is that they said uh we're not going to do $5 billion of free cash flow this year we're actually going to do $6 billion of free cash flow this year and you can't give away the stock it's mind-boggling oh and by the way we're not going to buy $5 billion of stock back uh this year like we did last year we're going to buy $6 billion back of stock uh which means you're going to own a bigger slice of the pie without putting any new money out of pocket revenues were up 8% transaction margin dollars were up 8% year on year operating income was up 17% year on year operating margin expanded 126 basis points EPS increased 177% that's a Growth Company ladies and gentlemen uh not a value trap that's a Growth Company total payment volume up 11% payment transactions 8% they even re accelerated active accounts uh by almost 2 million SE qu qually from last quarter to this quarter and generated 1.4 billion of free cash flow in this quarter alone they've got $18 billion of cash by the way uh net cash about 6 billion 12 billion of debt returned 1.5 billion to stockholders buying 24 million shares of common stock at low prices by the way which is when you want them to buy it which is the name of the game so you can see here every metric basically up margins up revenues up transactions up share count collapsing went from in uh 2023 uh 1.1 billion to uh just over 1.04 billion so they've taken out you know 6 60 million shares give or take no 60 58 78 million shares I mean that's pretty awesome and that's going to go down they're going to be below a billion shares which is pretty exciting um all right then you got uh adjusted free cash flow active accounts were up 2 million sequentially um transactions per active account up 11% driven by brain free transaction growth which is what everyone hated because it brought the overall margins and take rate down now that's reaccelerating remember fast lane increased conversion from 50% to 880 % that's rolling out in Earnest the second half that's going to be huge for the company their ad business is rolling out they just did a deal with door Dash and others uh then you've got uh their guidance they took up not only on free cash flow and BuyBacks but they took up their transaction um margin dollars uh from before slightly positive to low to mid single digit growth for fiscal year 2024 for uh non-gaap non-transaction operating expenses then you've got effective tax rate that's not a big deal EPS they went from mid to high single digigit growth to low to mid teens growth that is a monstrous difference and then they took up their Gap EPS to 388 to 398 range from 365 which is another huge jump and then free cash flow and share repurchase so it's huge absolutely hug huge venmo momentum continues to build in monthly active accounts increased across PayPal and venmo fast lane and ads platform is a big deal deal uh expand our addressable Market turn into a growth company which is a big deal deepening our partnership they're doing a huge deal with meta okay so one great meta which we already partner with on multiple fronts PayPal is a top payment method for advertisers and consumers globally across meta family of apps meta dominations and charitable giving campaigns now run on on PayPal giving fund platform meta pays out creators and developers using hyperwallet and meta uses brain tree for credit card processing meta is Facebook and Instagram for those of you and WhatsApp we are working closely with meta to optimize the experiences and look forward to deepening our partnership with meta in mutually beneficial ways in months and years ahead foundation for our next phase of growth they also did a renewed our contract with door Dash to expand how we work together Beyond unbranded PSP processing and offering our branded marks door Dash also relies on our risk capabilities to mitigate losses they will be participating with our new ads platform and remember that changed the game for Amazon when they added the ads business and for Uber uh margin of creative helping us to more profitable Dynamic we expect fast lane generally available in the US in the second half of the year so and by the way they're putting ascribing zero to their guidance raise to the benefits that fast Lane's going to bring to their margin which are going to be off the charts fast lane will accelerate PayPal's ability to capture roughly 60% share of e-commerce purchases made without a branded Mark best-in-class checkout experience in the second quarter we launched inapp offers with Major Brands including Best Buy Price Line lyt instacart Ticket Master Walmart and Nordstrom um redesigned vating payment page alone shows a conversion lift of 75 to 111 basis points in fact we drove almost 20 million app logins from our postp purchase experiences in June alone growing More than 70% from a year ago turning to venmo we're building on the business's strong Market position in the second quarter venmo process more than 73\nbillion in total payment volume growing 8% year-over-year with monthly active increasing 5% year over year to nearly 62 million both a strong base of peer-to-peer users and Adoption of our ecosystem of products are driving this growth for example both venmo debit card and pay with venmo monthly active users grew 30% uh we launched a push provisioning of the venmo debit card to Apple and Google wallets and continue to enable PayPal pay with venmo with merchants and partners including eBay and StubHub recently launched venmo teen venmo is primed for growth making it easier to add PayPal and venmo branded cards to Apple and Google Wallets on mobile devices etc etc so uh we were encouraged to see the sustained total active account growing growth following a positive inflection in the first quarter so they went from Contracting to expansion that's what you want to see at inflection points um transactions per active account which is a triling 12mth number with 60.9 in the second quarter up 11% transactions per active account grew 6% total payment volume grew 11% uh and total payment volume International also grew 11% Etc so there's just unbelievable things happening since this guy took over PayPal generated 1.4 billion in free cash flow 1.5 billion in share purchases bringing repurchases to 5 billion raising our guidance uh re accelerating durable profitable growth for the company given the strong start to the year we are raising our free cash flow guidance we covered that grew profitably venmo customers venmo ecosystem fast lane conversion from 50 to 80% we covered ### FEATURED_COMPANY_DEEP_DIVES\nStanley Black and Decker so I mean these have these things are starting to move Stanley Black and& Decker up from 77 to $107 in the last you know month uh that's a pretty big move um basically they had lower inventory destocking uh costs which is going to lead to restocking like we've said uh change supply chain transformation benefits and reduce shipping costs they should just Outsource the gxo by the way uh on track for expected pre-tax run rate Savings of 1.5 billion by the end of 2024 they've already done 1.3 and two billion by the end of 2025 I think we had done the math on that and uh it was like it was worth like $80 a share at at the normal historic multiple and that excludes the business but anyway let's just stick to the facts here uh organic Revenue growth led by DeWalt which is good gross margin was up 600 basis points to 28.4 their goal is to get to 30 back to 35% which they will um cash from operating activities was 573 million free cash flow was 486 million that's what you want to see in a turnaround story they have Runway uh they raise their earnings guidance to a basically 8040 basically 410 midpoint from a 4.0 midpoint so 370 to 450 from 350 to 450 and they raised their free cash flow to uh 750 million midpoint from a $700 million midpoint so that's huge uh supply chain improvements volume growth reaccelerating all the things you want to hear uh Cost Cuts in and then getting back to growth and getting getting revenues growing again so they're focused on all of it 3M again huge move here since February or or last you know if you go into the fall remember the last quarter we had that huge run from 68 to 90 then it checked back to 74 it's gone from 74 to 128 in the last four months this one's a beast plus we also got svent for free uh with the spin-off so uh you know these things take time but when they go they go all at once um so their organic growth was up modestly their Gap EPS was up 117% adjusted EPS up 39% operating CA uh cash flow a billion adjusted free cash flow was 1.2 billion so they free cash flow generative and they are uh increasing their guidance from [Music] a 705 midpoint to a 715 midpoint which is really good uh and everything's hitting on all cylinders again new CEO new jockey turnaround story and things moving in the right direction they returned 786

about 400 million of stock in the second quarter have the capacity to do more in the second half of next year they're going to do Acquisitions I'll be taking a fresh dispassionate look not only at am

down for this year by 62 bips transports were both both revised down for this year and next year 340 bips and 360 bips so you have to keep an eye on it my guess is that's skewed to one company though so Uber uh has come down uh no let's see here let's see where the big hit was FedEx a little bit oh probably UPS where's UPS yeah UPS was a big contributor to that um s a a and those look like the the

everything else went up uh here we have the kbe bank index had a Monster Month by the way up Regional Banks were up 18.3% last month which is unbelievable the basket not just one stock that had a good

of tech finally\n\n### MEDIA_APPEARANCE_RECAP\nwhat I was trying to talk to uh Neil Cavuto about was that you've got an AI arms race between Microsoft Google and Amazon uh and the arms dealers look like they're winning which is Invidia AMD and Intel in the short term but I think you're going to see um couple of the things is that you've got like you saw AMD earnings were good because demand for their gpus went up so not everyone wants only um Nvidia and if you saw meta's report yeah they were going to have like 100,000 uh h100s but then another 350,000 uh other gpus which you know other is could be Intel as we know the gouty 3 is 50% faster 50% cheaper and uses 40% less energy which is a huge operating cost for these data centers for the hyperscalers so um so I think nvidia's margin is going to be Intel opportunity and then Microsoft Google and Amazon in short term are going to have declining margins as they continue aggressive cap X until the shareholders stop them but seoa put out the key article which was the $600 billion question which says that the amount that they're spending right now is not even remotely justified by earnings so their margins are going to crash and that's why you see the decelerating earnings in that group and that they're uh stock started to um move down okay\n### FEATURED_COMPANY_DEEP_DIVES\nPayPal update so they had their best transaction margin dollar growth since 2021 they raised their 2024 guidance and increased the share repurchase they're coming from a position of strength so so what does that mean the most important thing that came out of this call is that they said uh we're not going to do $5 billion of free cash flow this year we're actually going to do $6 billion of free cash flow this year and you can't give away the stock it's mind-boggling oh and by the way we're not going to buy $5 billion of stock back uh this year like we did last year we're going to buy $6 billion back of stock uh which means you're going to own a bigger slice of the pie without putting any new money out of pocket revenues were up 8% transaction margin dollars were up 8% year on year operating income was up 17% year on year operating margin expanded 126 basis points EPS increased 177% that's a Growth Company ladies and gentlemen uh not a value trap that's a Growth Company total payment volume up 11% payment transactions 8% they even re accelerated active accounts uh by almost 2 million SE qu qually from last quarter to this quarter and generated 1.4 billion of free cash flow in this quarter alone they've got $18 billion of cash by the way uh net cash about 6 billion 12 billion of debt returned 1.5 billion to stockholders buying 24 million shares of common stock at low prices by the way which is when you want them to buy it which is the name of the game so you can see here every metric basically up margins up revenues up transactions up share count collapsing went from in uh 2023 uh 1.1 billion to uh just over 1.04 billion so they've taken out you know 6 60 million shares give or take no 60 58 78 million shares I mean that's pretty awesome and that's going to go down they're going to be below a billion shares which is pretty exciting um all right then you got uh adjusted free cash flow active accounts were up 2 million sequentially um transactions per active account up 11% driven by brain free transaction growth which is what everyone hated because it brought the overall margins and take rate down now that's reaccelerating remember fast lane increased conversion from 50% to 880 % that's rolling out in Earnest the second half that's going to be huge for the company their ad business is rolling out they just did a deal with door Dash and others uh then you've got uh their guidance they took up not only on free cash flow and BuyBacks but they took up their transaction um margin dollars uh from before slightly positive to low to mid single digit growth for fiscal year 2024 for uh non-gaap non-transaction operating expenses then you've got effective tax rate that's not a big deal EPS they went from mid to high single digigit growth to low to mid teens growth that is a monstrous difference and then they took up their Gap EPS to 388 to 398 range from 365 which is another huge jump and then free cash flow and share repurchase so it's huge absolutely hug huge venmo momentum continues to build in monthly active accounts increased across PayPal and venmo fast lane and ads platform is a big deal deal uh expand our addressable Market turn into a growth company which is a big deal deepening our partnership they're doing a huge deal with meta okay so one great meta which we already partner with on multiple fronts PayPal is a top payment method for advertisers and consumers globally across meta family of apps meta dominations and charitable giving campaigns now run on on PayPal giving fund platform meta pays out creators and developers using hyperwallet and meta uses brain tree for credit card processing meta is Facebook and Instagram for those of you and WhatsApp we are working closely with meta to optimize the experiences and look forward to deepening our partnership with meta in mutually beneficial ways in months and years ahead foundation for our next phase of growth they also did a renewed our contract with door Dash to expand how we work together Beyond unbranded PSP processing and offering our branded marks door Dash also relies on our risk capabilities to mitigate losses they will be participating with our new ads platform and remember that changed the game for Amazon when they added the ads business and for Uber uh margin of creative helping us to more profitable Dynamic we expect fast lane generally available in the US in the second half of the year so and by the way they're putting ascribing zero to their guidance raise to the benefits that fast Lane's going to bring to their margin which are going to be off the charts fast lane will accelerate PayPal's ability to capture roughly 60% share of e-commerce purchases made without a branded Mark best-in-class checkout experience in the second quarter we launched inapp offers with Major Brands including Best Buy Price Line lyt instacart Ticket Master Walmart and Nordstrom um redesigned vating payment page alone shows a conversion lift of 75 to 111 basis points in fact we drove almost 20 million app logins from our postp purchase experiences in June alone growing More than 70% from a year ago turning to venmo we're building on the business's strong Market position in the second quarter venmo process more than 73\nbillion in total payment volume growing 8% year-over-year with monthly active increasing 5% year over year to nearly 62 million both a strong base of peer-to-peer users and Adoption of our ecosystem of products are driving this growth for example both venmo debit card and pay with venmo monthly active users grew 30% uh we launched a push provisioning of the venmo debit card to Apple and Google wallets and continue to enable PayPal pay with venmo with merchants and partners including eBay and StubHub recently launched venmo teen venmo is primed for growth making it easier to add PayPal and venmo branded cards to Apple and Google Wallets on mobile devices etc etc so uh we were encouraged to see the sustained total active account growing growth following a positive inflection in the first quarter so they went from Contracting to expansion that's what you want to see at inflection points um transactions per active account which is a triling 12mth number with 60.9 in the second quarter up 11% transactions per active account grew 6% total payment volume grew 11% uh and total payment volume International also grew 11% Etc so there's just unbelievable things happening since this guy took over PayPal generated 1.4 billion in free cash flow 1.5 billion in share purchases bringing repurchases to 5 billion raising our guidance uh re accelerating durable profitable growth for the company given the strong start to the year we are raising our free cash flow guidance we covered that grew profitably venmo customers venmo ecosystem fast lane conversion from 50 to 80% we covered ### FEATURED_COMPANY_DEEP_DIVES\nStanley Black and Decker so I mean these have these things are starting to move Stanley Black and& Decker up from 77 to $107 in the last you know month uh that's a pretty big move um basically they had lower inventory destocking uh costs which is going to lead to restocking like we've said uh change supply chain transformation benefits and reduce shipping costs they should just Outsource the gxo by the way uh on track for expected pre-tax run rate Savings of 1.5 billion by the end of 2024 they've already done 1.3 and two billion by the end of 2025 I think we had done the math on that and uh it was like it was worth like $80 a share at at the normal historic multiple and that excludes the business but anyway let's just stick to the facts here uh organic Revenue growth led by DeWalt which is good gross margin was up 600 basis points to 28.4 their goal is to get to 30 back to 35% which they will um cash from operating activities was 573 million free cash flow was 486 million that's what you want to see in a turnaround story they have Runway uh they raise their earnings guidance to a basically 8040 basically 410 midpoint from a 4.0 midpoint so 370 to 450 from 350 to 450 and they raised their free cash flow to uh 750 million midpoint from a $700 million midpoint so that's huge uh supply chain improvements volume growth reaccelerating all the things you want to hear uh Cost Cuts in and then getting back to growth and getting getting revenues growing again so they're focused on all of it 3M again huge move here since February or or last you know if you go into the fall remember the last quarter we had that huge run from 68 to 90 then it checked back to 74 it's gone from 74 to 128 in the last four months this one's a beast plus we also got svent for free uh with the spin-off so uh you know these things take time but when they go they go all at once um so their organic growth was up modestly their Gap EPS was up 117% adjusted EPS up 39% operating CA uh cash flow a billion adjusted free cash flow was 1.2 billion so they free cash flow generative and they are uh increasing their guidance from [Music] a 705 midpoint to a 715 midpoint which is really good uh and everything's hitting on all cylinders again new CEO new jockey turnaround story and things moving in the right direction they returned 786 million to shareholders via dividends and share repurchases um and moved up their end point so you can go through some of these on the different divisions whether it's safety and Industrial Transportation Electronics consumer full year guidance they took their adjusted operating margin up uh from a 237 bips midpoint increased to a 250 bip so they're they're they're going faster than they expected which is a good thing and uh all is in place so they've talked about spinning out the business all the things that they've already accomplished and uh strong balance sheet we repurchased about 400 million of stock in the second quarter have the capacity to do more in the second half of next year they're going to do Acquisitions I'll be taking a fresh dispassionate look not only at am m&a but uh at our portfolio to determine if there's any asss that have greater value owned by others along the same line what assets might be a good fit for 3M I don't have anything to say on that yet so he's he's doing a portfolio management which is a good thing ### MACRO_DATA_SLIDES\nmoving on retail earnings top 30 weights of the sector uh estimates were revised up for next year by three bips down for this year by 62 bips transports were both both revised down for this year and next year 340 bips and 360 bips so you have to keep an eye on it my guess is that's skewed to one company though so Uber uh has come down uh no let's see here let's see where the big hit was FedEx a little bit oh probably UPS where's UPS yeah UPS was a big contributor to that um s a a and those look like the the big ones all right ### HEADLINES_AND_NEWS\nuh tomorrow we've got uh the jobs report expected private non-farm payrolls expected to be plus 176 um we probably want to see a bit lower than 176 uh in order to keep the September guarantee on the table but not so much more that people panic that there's no back stop before September so uh you don't want to see a a super low number also watch the revisions downward and then",
    "### MACRO_DATA_SLIDES": "\n\ntoday's largest seven are cheaper and of higher quality than 2,000 we've covered that in the past that's from NED Davis research uh showing us that we're not going to have another 90% down NASDAQ everyone pointing to the Cisco chart it's nothing like that because these do have earnings power they're decelerating earnings power but huge free cash flow and they'll get to a multiple attractive enough that bids will come in unless they dramatically overspend then they'll come down more uh this is job openings uh jolt has D dropped all the way back down to pre pandemic levels job quitting Falls to nearly fouryear low and job openings dip in sign labor market is cooling uh here's the quit rate collaps Bank of Japan raises Benchmark interest rate outlines road map for trimming Bond buying program so this all happened in the last week we said it was coming it's coming now it's here and that's caused a liquidity shock that we have to keep an eye on but I think the FED will use its other facilities to bridge time over the next six weeks and actually be in the market repurchasing rolloff Securities in size uh to keep the liquidity flowing until they actually do the cut here's the 2-year government bond yield starting to rip higher this year uh dollar Yen recovered 10year government bond yield I think broke below 4% today so that is remember we said 3.75% before 5% when everyone when it was at 490 and everyone was saying it was going back to five we said nope it's going to 375 before it goes to 5 and it's collapsed in that regard TLT is up big time real estate is biggest source of distressed bonds and Loans so everything else is looking good    this is really in the scheme of things 194 billion is is uh chicken feed relative to the overall Market you know $ 1220 trillion doll of assets delinquency rate of cmbs loans there's going to be a pony in the pile here for someone that gets this right but uh I think it's a little early foreclosures on the rise uh value of C's commercial properties again commercial capex growth slowed in 2018 19 amid trade War it's starting to pick pick up again    we covered the decelerating earnings of the mag7 momentum tilt is well above average this is starting to roll over so if you're in all the momo stocks get ready for some more pain if you Haven an experienced enough in Q in uh July this is the sler stuff uh from yesterday looked like Russell's trying to bottom here nasdaq's trying to bottom today check back my sense is um we probably get a bounce from here a lot of these tech stocks look oversold but we we'll see  um just Instinct and it feels like this Market wants to hold up for another four to four four to six weeks into the next fed meeting and then sell the news but    that's not how we make our money anyway it really doesn't impact how many generators are going to be sold how many DeWalt uh uh TRS are uh Stanley TRS and DeWalt jackhammers are going to be sold uh and drill bits and everything else so we don't really worry about the day-to-day but we like to keep an eye on everything 10year yield yeah that broke this down trend line so that's good to see all of the stuff lining up for what we want to see in our portfolio and have started to see aggressively in the last four weeks Banks exposure is still one standard deviation below average so we're going to want to get involved again or or rebuild that position you know you city was a big move pulls back we can add add back uh like we've done with other stocks before uh beta C cyclical bullish exposure is near all-time lows    this is what we want to take advantage of and uh dividend yield is starting to move up we were talking about it for months when it was all the way down here now it's starting to come in as we anticipated hedge fund positioning uh long positions through their estimating short positions Bas total short interest exposure to cyclical versus defensive sectors is at an all-time low so this is why when when hedge funds get this extreme against cyclical that's usually when you get the the move because they're caught off sides and they're the ones that chase uh discretionary is most shorted sector financials is the least shorted which is why it's kind of makes sense to uh shortterm having uh taken a some profits there in the short term uh highest net relative exposure to utilities lowest to energy if you remember we were pounding the tables on utilities a year ago they've had a Monster Run uh and now uh they can't get enough of them they'll probably continue to do well over time I haven't looked at let me just take a look at xlu here real quick but the fact that hedge funds are getting excited and crowding in probably tells me that it's time to take a little bit of a break    and then they hate energy so energy sold off those those will probably start to move uh sooner than we anticipate performance of the Russell 1,000 versus value versus growth uh from starting forward PE spreads 1995 to 2019 so effectively in June 2024 we were at the 95th th percentile of growth over value and from that time period what you see is a dramatic outperformance of value as a matter of fact value outperformed growth by 7% in the month of June alone value was up some 5% growth was down some 2% uh so that was a one of the widest spreads then you see here value outperforms you you haven't seen value cheap relative to growth since 1937 and then next 30 years it was all value uh so    so this is setting up and that's also in line with more of the returns coming from dividends uh and    rates coming down and all of the things that go along with that and people are going to want to see cash flow and Tech margins coming down because they're going to do all this investment in AI    here's a note from J they took the price Target up to 175 from 145 opinion follows Trend    initial jobless claims these are the things that guarantee a cut in September this is Jeremy signal on Liz Clayman show by the way I will be on Fox Business the Clayman countdown live in studio with Liz Clayman tomorrow at 3 P.M very excited about that so tune in if you're free but seagull was on today saying uh 50 basis points is is not off the table in September meaning they might have to play catchup bring out magnificent 7 to decelerated rest is expected to improve so that's a newer chart manufacturing PMI was weak this month so we got to keep an eye on that but there's some seasonality around that it was also weak uh mid last year as well continuing jobless claims really starting to spike up highest since November 27th 2021 initial jobless claims uh highest going all the way back to September    and then more than 50% of 74 us CPI components are running below 2% for 3 months now so uh that's a big deal this is from fun Strat via Seth golden get your small caps uh what he's saying is that small caps early signal early cycle in 11 of 12 trading sessions the Russell 2000 traded plusus 1% only occurred 10 times since 1979 outside of recessions and bare marks early signal given years 8798 2009 2011 2020 uh forward returns and positivity rates 1 month out up 10% we saw that last month 3 months out up 18% 6 months out up 31% 12 months out up 51% uh all with a 100 positivity rate after you get past that first first month which we had in July so expect more to come meaning potentially another 40% more to come in small caps    this is also from Tom Lee via Seth golden 2-year yield minus bed fun funds rate Gap is a big risk on Signal which anticipates a 4 to 5% S&P 500 rally ahead which would imply we do get a bounce from the tech Magnificent Seven stocks that have been beat down in as a matter of fact that basket after I went on and talked about the C change out of the Magnificent 7 into the UNM magnificent 493    that basket there's an ETF called Big T uh that is the Magnificent 7 and it dropped 15% over the next few weeks the Magnificent 7 while the rest of the stuff like Banks were up 18% and everything else new vehicle total inventory this is exactly what we wanted to see we're going to start to see more incentives and more reasons to get people out replacing those 13 and a half year old cars uh which is going to be a big deal and margins for the oems are going to go down because they're going to be in price Wars but doing big volumes and like like generators when your neighbor gets one you want one and we're going to get a big refresh cycling cars as the prices come down as rates come down as incentives go up as inventories build it's a good thing for for Cooper standard which is not in the arms War it's in the arms dealing business which is what we want to be in    okay here's another thing from uh Jim Paulson via Seth Seth golden uh basically he's talking about when the 10year yield Falls and M2 money supply Rises like they are now historically S&P delivers higher returns than when these two variables are not moving in opposite opposite directions so while everyone knows September Is A bad month when both of these things are happening 10 yield is falling and money supply is rising you often get positive months so that could actually throw the weakness pre-election weakness idea and September weakness and sell the news weakness out the window I wouldn't bet on that but I like the fact that I like the idea despite what you saw today I like the ideaa that    the market holds up into September we we will see    some of that will have to do with Apple earnings which I think we're okay after hours I'm just looking at the screen while I'm talking and Amazon uh so we'll see how those come in if those two can bounce even if Nvidia keeps falling    I think that uh we'll get the bounce in the S&P 500 first time since 2020 that we've seen six straight declines in the 10-year yield of two basis points or more uh so that's that the change in the FED statement here uh leads to September for sure ADP employment I think we're getting close to the end here and then July performance this is very important I just ran these numbers in in advance of going on claiming tomorrow for July the S&P was only up 1% Dow was up 4.5% Russell small caps were up 10.4% and the NASDAQ was down 1.68% small Banks were up 18.6% reats were up 75% utilities were up 7% Industrials were up 5% and mag 7 was down 35 basis points semiconductors were down 5% here's 80% of global Central Bank are expected to be in easing mode by the end of 2024 versus only 10% in July 2023 that's good news but right now Japan is tightening and not enough of the West is uh easing yet so I think you could see some choppiness unless they use other facilities to paper it over until September    consensus 12-month forward EPS growth projections continue to Trend up across regions that's Asia Pacific Europe and the US that's positive more often than not the s&p500 delivered robust returns following the first fed cut here's the S&P return since 1950 when the US economy did not see a recession within a year of the first Fed rate cut so first month after the average return is negative -3% so we want to keep that in mind as we you know if we show continued strength into mid-september before the FED meeting that will be an opportunity for us to get more defensive raise some cash maybe put on some tactical shorts uh for that month into the election and then two months after you're up on average 7% 3 months after up 10% uh 6 months after 12% 12 months after 15% so I think this time will be similar",
    "### TECHNICAL_CHARTS": "\n\ntoday's largest seven are cheaper and of higher quality than 2,000 we've covered that in the past that's from NED Davis research uh showing us that we're not going to have another 90% down NASDAQ everyone pointing to the Cisco chart it's nothing like that because these do have earnings power they're decelerating earnings power but huge free cash flow and they'll get to a multiple attractive enough that bids will come in unless they dramatically overspend then they'll come down more uh this is job openings uh jolt has D dropped all the way back down to pre pandemic levels job quitting Falls to nearly fouryear low and job openings dip in sign labor market is cooling uh here's the quit rate collaps Bank of Japan raises Benchmark interest rate outlines road map for trimming Bond buying program so this all happened in the last week we said it was coming it's coming now it's here and that's caused a liquidity shock that we have to keep an eye on but I think the FED will use its other facilities to bridge time over the next six weeks and actually be in the market repurchasing rolloff Securities in size uh to keep the liquidity flowing until they actually do the cut here's the 2-year government bond yield starting to rip higher this year uh dollar Yen recovered 10year government bond yield I think broke below 4% today so that is remember we said 3.75% before 5% when everyone when it was at 490 and everyone was saying it was going back to five we said nope it's going to 375 before it goes to 5 and it's collapsed in that regard TLT is up big time real estate is biggest source of distressed bonds and Loans so everything else is looking good    this is really in the scheme of things 194 billion is is uh chicken feed relative to the overall Market you know $ 1220 trillion doll of assets delinquency rate of cmbs loans there's going to be a pony in the pile here for someone that gets this right but uh I think it's a little early foreclosures on the rise uh value of C's commercial properties again commercial capex growth slowed in 2018 19 amid trade War it's starting to pick pick up again    we covered the decelerating earnings of the mag7 momentum tilt is well above average this is starting to roll over so if you're in all the momo stocks get ready for some more pain if you Haven an experienced enough in Q in uh July this is the sler stuff uh from yesterday looked like Russell's trying to bottom here nasdaq's trying to bottom today check back my sense is um we probably get a bounce from here a lot of these tech stocks look oversold but we we'll see  um just Instinct and it feels like this Market wants to hold up for another four to four four to six weeks into the next fed meeting and then sell the news but    that's not how we make our money anyway it really doesn't impact how many generators are going to be sold how many DeWalt uh uh TRS are uh Stanley TRS and DeWalt jackhammers are going to be sold uh and drill bits and everything else so we don't really worry about the day-to-day but we like to keep an eye on everything 10year yield yeah that broke this down trend line so that's good to see all of the stuff lining up for what we want to see in our portfolio and have started to see aggressively in the last four weeks Banks exposure is still one standard deviation below average so we're going to want to get involved again or or rebuild that position you know you city was a big move pulls back we can add add back uh like we've done with other stocks before uh beta C cyclical bullish exposure is near all-time lows    this is what we want to take advantage of and uh dividend yield is starting to move up we were talking about it for months when it was all the way down here now it's starting to come in as we anticipated hedge fund positioning uh long positions through their estimating short positions Bas total short interest exposure to cyclical versus defensive sectors is at an all-time low so this is why when when hedge funds get this extreme against cyclical that's usually when you get the the move because they're caught off sides and they're the ones that chase uh discretionary is most shorted sector financials is the least shorted which is why it's kind of makes sense to uh shortterm having uh taken a some profits there in the short term uh highest net relative exposure to utilities lowest to energy if you remember we were pounding the tables on utilities a year ago they've had a Monster Run uh and now uh they can't get enough of them they'll probably continue to do well over time I haven't looked at let me just take a look at xlu here real quick but the fact that hedge funds are getting excited and crowding in probably tells me that it's time to take a little bit of a break    and then they hate energy so energy sold off those those will probably start to move uh sooner than we anticipate performance of the Russell 1,000 versus value versus growth uh from starting forward PE spreads 1995 to 2019 so effectively in June 2024 we were at the 95th th percentile of growth over value and from that time period what you see is a dramatic outperformance of value as a matter of fact value outperformed growth by 7% in the month of June alone value was up some 5% growth was down some 2% uh so that was a one of the widest spreads then you see here value outperforms you you haven't seen value cheap relative to growth since 1937 and then next 30 years it was all value uh so    so this is setting up and that's also in line with more of the returns coming from dividends uh and    rates coming down and all of the things that go along with that and people are going to want to see cash flow and Tech margins coming down because they're going to do all this investment in AI    here's a note from J they took the price Target up to 175 from 145 opinion follows Trend    initial jobless claims these are the things that guarantee a cut in September this is Jeremy signal on Liz Clayman show by the way I will be on Fox Business the Clayman countdown live in studio with Liz Clayman tomorrow at 3 P.M very excited about that so tune in if you're free but seagull was on today saying uh 50 basis points is is not off the table in September meaning they might have to play catchup bring out magnificent 7 to decelerated rest is expected to improve so that's a newer chart manufacturing PMI was weak this month so we got to keep an eye on that but there's some seasonality around that it was also weak uh mid last year as well continuing jobless claims really starting to spike up highest since November 27th 2021 initial jobless claims uh highest going all the way back to September    and then more than 50% of 74 us CPI components are running below 2% for 3 months now so uh that's a big deal this is from fun Strat via Seth golden get your small caps uh what he's saying is that small caps early signal early cycle in 11 of 12 trading sessions the Russell 2000 traded plusus 1% only occurred 10 times since 1979 outside of recessions and bare marks early signal given years 8798 2009 2011 2020 uh forward returns and positivity rates 1 month out up 10% we saw that last month 3 months out up 18% 6 months out up 31% 12 months out up 51% uh all with a 100 positivity rate after you get past that first first month which we had in July so expect more to come meaning potentially another 40% more to come in small caps    this is also from Tom Lee via Seth golden 2-year yield minus bed fun funds rate Gap is a big risk on Signal which anticipates a 4 to 5% S&P 500 rally ahead which would imply we do get a bounce from the tech Magnificent Seven stocks that have been beat down in as a matter of fact that basket after I went on and talked about the C change out of the Magnificent 7 into the UNM magnificent 493    that basket there's an ETF called Big T uh that is the Magnificent 7 and it dropped 15% over the next few weeks the Magnificent 7 while the rest of the stuff like Banks were up 18% and everything else new vehicle total inventory this is exactly what we wanted to see we're going to start to see more incentives and more reasons to get people out replacing those 13 and a half year old cars uh which is going to be a big deal and margins for the oems are going to go down because they're going to be in price Wars but doing big volumes and like like generators when your neighbor gets one you want one and we're going to get a big refresh cycling cars as the prices come down as rates come down as incentives go up as inventories build it's a good thing for for Cooper standard which is not in the arms War it's in the arms dealing business which is what we want to be in    okay here's another thing from uh Jim Paulson via Seth Seth golden uh basically he's talking about when the 10year yield Falls and M2 money supply Rises like they are now historically S&P delivers higher returns than when these two variables are not moving in opposite opposite directions so while everyone knows September Is A bad month when both of these things are happening 10 yield is falling and money supply is rising you often get positive months so that could actually throw the weakness pre-election weakness idea and September weakness and sell the news weakness out the window I wouldn't bet on that but I like the fact that I like the idea despite what you saw today I like the ideaa that    the market holds up into September we we will see    some of that will have to do with Apple earnings which I think we're

the name of the game game that everyone was worried about and they've turned the corner as anticipated that move is just beginning Bank of England decision another Central Bank Cuts ahead of the FED Disney bets on Deadpool Wolverine and dirty jokes to save Marvel whatever it takes like I told you Bob Iger will play Bible movies 24/7 if it means iida will go back up they learned their lessons they went woke but they don't want to go broke so they're pivoting xbo earnings show us manufacturing improved shares rise fed path for September interest rate cut that's after the fact Tim maros the FED Whisperer wrote that so it's telling us what we already know there's gun laac saying they should have cut yesterday we agree us productivity rebounds sharply in the second quarter which could help a soft Landing so you're seeing all these mixed things there's enough good happening to overcome the FED sucking its thumb but uh if they suck for too long we're going to wind up with uh some issues so uh and it's going to cost them much more go down as one of the worst fed chairs in history versus one of the best and then the difference between those two binary outcomes could be you know two months difference uh or in this case six or eight weeks but I think he can get away with uh sitting on his hands in July but he won't be able to get away with sitting on his hands in September initial jobless claims rise to onee high as hiring slows that's the key message China revs up us up fiscal policy support to Spur economic recovery so they're back back at it can Kelly ortberg turn Boeing around people like him from Rockwell Collins uh he had a huge run with his stock while he was running that I think he's going to do the same for Boeing since 1995 value stocks have always outperformed when they're this cheap by a big margin and uh so we covered these two charts earlier Intel to cut okay so Intel reported after hours their stock is down I want to listen to the call he's going to be on CNBC tomorrow my guess is if he was if it was a disaster he would throw his CFO on instead of himself so he'll he'll be there tomorrow to talk it up but this really does not change the long-term strategy so they're cutting a bunch of costs they miss bu a hair um I'll wait and uh listen to the call tonight before we add any shares or make a decision whether we're going to add any shares but we're comfortable with ours if you remember we bought it 25 we sold 2/3 at 20 at 48 and then we re rebuilt the position between 29 and 31 so we've made some money on it the question is do we want to add more back at 25 or 24 wherever is it is after hours and uh after the call I'll make that decision but um uh more likely than not uh I think it it makes sense and uh unless I hear something in the call that's uh egregious but the Legacy business so they Revenue declined by 1% that's not the end of the world um and remember the whole growth story story is the 45 billion of Grants tax breaks and Loans from the US government to to stand up a duopoly with Taiwan semiconductor that all the Western Fortune 500s are going to push their demand through uh due to government pressure so um that's not in the numbers yet Canada Goose reported uh surprising because it surprisingly okay given that it's off seon they were able so the wholesale continues to go down the directed consumer continues to go up which is going to increase margins over time which we like China was up again I was a little worried about China because every other company had china down uh but China was actually up and Asia Pacific was up so those were strong reg regions um uh overall for the company revenues were up a few percent and then their their margins were a little bit worse because they bought a new Factory that they have to take the cost out of so they had some impact but revenues for the quarter were up you know 5% basically uh from 84 to 88 million year on year so uh so the business continues to do well and is what is considered to be a week quarter so I'll listen to that one that one came out today as well Pals TRS and towels",

CONTINUED ---\n\nask me anything\n\nEdgard Abu says first of all thanks for the quality information you provide every day and week I've been listening for two years Chang my way to investing I'd like you to have a look at crowd strike very niche market getting bitter by the day 18% market share recent events provideed by opportunity uh we cannot quantify how much they're going to have to pay out one Airline asked them for a half a billion dollar that's number one number two a friend actually contacted me on this who owned owned it and you know he was saying that um and and you know my first response to him was look I don't own stocks like that it when when he contacted me it was trading at 75 billion now it's at 54 billion by the way uh but that was after the First full it was trading at 75 billion and I said look you know it was trading at 16 times sales that's that's not a business I would ever own in a million years um irrespective of How High the momentum goes or anything else so uh you know so would I own it at 11 times sales uh and the answer is um 11 times sales and 40 times earnings what's the earnings growth 20 times no I probably wouldn't so um could it get a bounce you know with uh with a tech bounce sure it could but I think there's any way to quantify this risk so for me it's a it's a pass there's down and down for a reason uh so that's that Allen hair uh morning Tom been listening for a while really enjoy the content no in the past you mentioned no interest in Ford or GM but after Ford's big drop last week has that impacted your opinion okay so Ford and GM are annuity and healthcare companies with a car business attached on the side and for that reason I will never own own an oem a union-based business because you don't control your margins you don't control your future and uh and in that regard uh sold to you so um Jim Jones would you look at Smith and Wesson uh I've looked at this thing a million times the numbers look great and the stock never does anything so I would say no but I'll just take one more look at it um because it's been a while Smith and Wesson well let me just type in Wesson all right s swbi all right so it's training at about half off what's happening with the business s swbi so I guess these people are are asking me because they think it's going to do really well if there's a change in administration I think it doesn't matter because look look the last Administration came in here the stock collapsed from 2016 to 2020 it went from 20 down to three um and then under the current Administration where you think it would do terrible it went from 3 to 35 so uh all right well there you go um now cash flows re accelerating but revenues are collapsing uh gross margins collapsing I I'm going to say say pass that not for me I understand why you're looking at it maybe it works but I wouldn't be I wouldn't be interested Zack tan like your opinion on a potential hedge between Cooper standard and Advanced Auto Parts given the age of vehicles is hting 13 and a half do you agree that stock movements could complement each other when fundamentals either ship bullish or bearish for vehicle production besides being backed by market fundamentals huge oper that are being worked on supply chain they're not going to hedge each other they're they're discret businesses okay the people who who won't be able to get in new cars uh you know that aren't the 18 million people is you know 315 million other people that have old crappy cars that have to fix them so once they fix the business uh it's going to make money again and um I think they're both great so they're not hedging anything don't over complicate it they're two discret businesses uh can you take a look at global payment Network and arsal or Mattel Mattel we did I'm not interested in that business gpn is uh it's too opaque for me because you've got Consumer Debt that I can't quantify and I don't understand what's on off balance sheet on balance sheet so uh for me it's probably a pass I I understand s swp not swpi um gpn is getting cheap but te operates Merchant settlement funding chargeback resolution R of software streamline businesses I I've got enough payments business with the PayPal well I'll just focus on that I um gpn uh let's see here I mean look it's a lowquality business it's definitely trading towards the low end of its range I mean if you want to take a little risk I I I don't like the business enough I'm just going to tell you I looked at it in the past I think it could certainly Bounce from here and keep going I just I just don't love it here so I'm going to pass even though it does look attractive and I understand how you got there um but it's not for me Martin florini love to hear your thoughts on tbbb it's a Mexican food chain I'm going to along the lines of Aldi growing Revenue in stores uh supermarkets are not good businesses unless you're Walmart so I'm probably a pass there's there's really not enough information for me and not enough of an operating history for me to get comfortable um I generally only invest in public companies that have I I mean you'd have to pull up the perspectives and see their last 20 years of data I I mean I understand wanting to get some exposure to Mexico uh don't get me wrong um gross margins mid teens free cash flows growing revenues are growing yeah it it's just not for me I I don't think there's anything wrong with it but it's not the kind of business that I invest in um doesn't mean it won't work it certainly could but it's not it's going to work without me Adam thoughts on whirpool we've covered this one I think it's okay I think you're going to get the uh cycle back going here again um and you get a dividend while you wait uh I think there was a problem with cash flow with this one though yeah so it's just starting to re accelerate revenues got hammered so you just have to you have to do your work and understand what's the plan to turn it around and if it's a plausible plan and who's doing the turnaround and if you can get comfort with all those things I mean you probably have a decent enough margin of safety let's see where the uh balance sheet is billion doll of cash $6.4 billion of debt on one and a half billion of cash so you definitely want to uh get a sense of when all of those are uh maturing like in um the case of Canada Goose we've got a couple years to 2027 same as uh Cooper standard so we're comfortable there so you got to get Comfort on that but all in you should probably be able to make this one work Adam after you do your work uh longtime listener Stefon from Canada paycom we've covered that a bunch of times and we passed on it all times uh I don't have any Edge as to what their mode is so for me it's a pass um I don't know how they retain share but the numbers look definitely attractive even though Revenue growth is decelerating so then you're going to get multiple contraction um the question is what was the multiple so five times sales 20 times earnings what's the earnings cash flow is probably a cash machine yes Capital yeah I mean look if you can get comfort that they're going to maintain their moat and what they have is impenetrable then yeah I mean it looks great on paper um but that's that's a big project to get comfort that their mode is gonna not not erode um and I understand why you got there and there's probably something to it but you know often times when these things break they just take a long time so um for that reason I'm I'm going to take a pass on that one even though it could certainly work for you after you do more more work uh next is Sam R what's your opinion on macro Legends like Soros dren Miller and macro hedge funds in general hard to be consistently good and more oneoff amazing trade that defines them I I think it's just a different way to make money I mean there's a ton of ways to make money you know you there's not one right way so uh in the case of dren Miller and Soros which is basically the same thing they had a monster trade where they shorted the British pound and they got lucky with some policy changes but um you know over time drun and Miller has delivered so that it's a different style so has Buffett so has the guy at Renaissance who does you know high frequency trading it's just many different ways to make money so uh I've got nothing really to say other than uh congratulations on an incredible long-term track record you know same thing I would say to Buffett and uh and many others so River Rahi uh you just have to know what you're good at that that that's really what what it comes down to I like the time Arbitrage business buy quality businesses IGN the short-term noise as long as the fundamentals are improving eventually the price will catch up use low leverage so you can live and to see the realization and over time you're going to compound some some double and triple much faster than you anticipate and some take longer but on balance you can outperform if you have a great framework uh River Rah uh recent listener love your podcast change my investing strategy sleep better at night

instead of himself so he'll he'll be there tomorrow to talk it up but this really does not change the long-term strategy so they're cutting a bunch of costs they miss bu a hair um I'll wait and uh listen to the call tonight before we add any shares or make a decision whether we're going to add any shares but we're comfortable with ours if you remember we bought it 25 we sold 2/3 at 20 at 48 and then we re rebuilt the position between 29 and 31 so we've made some money on it the question is do we want to add more back at 25 or 24 wherever is it is after hours and uh after the call I'll make that decision but um uh more likely than not uh I think it it makes sense and uh unless I hear something in the call that's uh egregious but the Legacy business so they Revenue declined by 1% that's not the end of the world um and remember the whole growth story story is the 45 billion of Grants tax breaks and Loans from the US government to to stand up a duopoly with Taiwan semiconductor that all the Western Fortune 500s are going to push their demand through uh due to government pressure so um that's not in the numbers yet Canada Goose reported uh surprising because it surprisingly okay given that it's off seon they were able so the wholesale continues to go down the directed consumer continues to go up which is going to increase margins over time which we like China was up again I was a little worried about China because every other company had china down uh but China was actually up and Asia Pacific was up so those were strong reg regions um uh overall for the company revenues were up a few percent and then their their margins were a little bit worse because they bought a new Factory that they have to take the cost out of so they had some impact but revenues for the quarter were up you know 5% basically uh from 84 to 88 million year on year so uh so the business continues to do well and is what is considered to be a week quarter so I'll listen to that one that one came out today as well Pals TRS and towels"
