[0.8s] Welcome to Hedge Fund Tips with Tom
[2.96s] Hayes. I&#39;m Tom Hayes and this is your
[6.359s] 283rd videocast podcast for the week
[8.88s] ending March 20th, 2025. Lot of great
[12.32s] stuff to cover today, but first we&#39;re
[14.16s] going to do family first as always. Uh
[16.8s] this was an incredible photo we had this
[18.8s] week coming home from one of Mimi&#39;s
[21.039s] water polo games. So that was that. Uh,
[24.4s] as for the results, uh, Mimi&#39;s team, 12U
[29.16s] girls played 16U girl tournament and
[34.399s] they lost all four games, which was
[36.64s] surprising as you&#39;re watching because
[38.16s] you&#39;re forgetting that they&#39;re playing
[39.36s] against 16-year-olds until we went into
[42.079s] the parking lot on Sunday night after
[44.399s] the four games and we saw half of the
[47.039s] the girls that they played against get
[49.6s] into the driver&#39;s side door instead of
[52.559s] the passenger side door and put the keys
[54.879s] in the ignition and drive away. Uh so I
[57.68s] think it was a great experience. It was
[59.44s] not a blowout, so they held their own
[61.359s] against girls that were four years older
[63.6s] them than them for the most part. That
[65.84s] was pretty exciting. And then uh
[67.6s] Annabelle set three records this past
[70.0s] weekend at the Southern California age
[72.0s] group championships. Two team records
[74.4s] and one California swimming relay
[76.479s] record. She&#39;s now number one in the
[78.88s] country for 10 and under in both 500
[82.159s] freestyle and 100 backstrokes. So,
[84.88s] awesome stuff there. Uh that&#39;s on the uh
[89.6s] uh Instagram for her team and her
[93.04s] teammates who did an incredible job with
[94.96s] the
[95.72s] relay. Uh and I
[99.64s] think I think that&#39;s that. And these are
[102.64s] the times.
[104.439s] 524.96 on the 500 free and
[111.119s] uh and that&#39;s that. So very very
[113.6s] exciting stuff. And then um we had the
[118.159s] most incredible week and the most
[120.399s] incredible opportunity to interview the
[125.119s] CEO of Cooper Standard, Mr. Jeff
[128.479s] Edwards, the chairman and CEO. And you
[132.36s] know, you&#39;re going to be blown away by
[135.44s] how Jeff explains the company, where
[138.8s] it&#39;s been, where it is, and where it&#39;s
[141.12s] going. Uh, but one of the key themes of
[144.879s] our podcast for the last 5 years has
[147.72s] been to burden yourself with the facts.
[152.08s] And my good friend and client Damian L
[155.76s] got me these caps. They&#39;re Nike. Uh they
[159.519s] say burden yourself with the facts.
[161.2s] Great Hill Capital. Absolutely
[163.08s] incredible. Tag still on. We&#39;ve got 10
[166.959s] of these. And what I want to do this
[170.48s] week is we&#39;re going to run a promotion
[174.28s] for the
[176.2s] 10 or so
[178.92s] best responses. is you&#39;re going to
[181.2s] comment below in the YouTube section of
[184.48s] the comment section and say what was
[187.68s] your number one takeaway or what did you
[190.72s] learn from listening to Jeff Edwards in
[192.879s] this interview which they&#39;ve posted on
[195.12s] their uh investor relations part of
[197.76s] their website you can go to
[198.8s] cooperstandard.com
[200.8s] uh and then we posted afterwards uh on
[203.68s] YouTube and we post it on our site so if
[207.04s] you had a chance to listen to it already
[209.2s] you can skip through this part. If you
[211.68s] didn&#39;t, um, definitely listen in, try to
[215.2s] take some notes. We we found this really
[217.2s] valuable. And out of the comments below,
[221.28s] I&#39;m going to have Jeff pick 10 that are
[224.56s] the top 10 comments, takeaways, and
[227.76s] we&#39;ll reach out to you to get your
[229.36s] address and mail you out one of these
[231.28s] one time only. Nike, burden yourself
[234.319s] with the facts, uh, demonstrating that
[237.2s] you took the time to educate yourself
[239.68s] and look at all this because, uh, a lot
[241.92s] of the stuff that he shares, if you&#39;ve
[244.08s] done your research, uh, or been part of
[246.56s] the podcast and also done your research,
[249.439s] um, you would already know this, but
[251.519s] Jeff did a good job explaining it in a
[255.2s] way for everyone under to understand in
[257.44s] a more granular way. As always, this is
[260.079s] opinion, not advice. check with your
[262.72s] financial advisor, click on terms, uh,
[265.759s] etc. But without further ado, I&#39;m so
[267.919s] grateful. I want to thank, um, uh,
[270.8s] especially Jeff Edwards, John Bannis,
[274.24s] Roger Hendrickson over there at Cooper
[276.72s] Standard for making this all happen.
[278.56s] Here you go. Well, everyone, I&#39;d like to
[281.44s] welcome the chairman and CEO of Cooper
[284.56s] Standard, M, Mr. Jeff Edwards. Thank you
[287.6s] so much, Jeff, for taking the time to be
[289.28s] with us today.
[290.88s] Thanks, Tom. I&#39;m looking forward to our
[292.56s] conversation. Yeah. So, uh, a little
[295.44s] quick background for the listeners here.
[297.199s] Obviously, we are large shareholders of
[299.44s] Cooper Standards, so full disclosure
[301.28s] there. We got involved with the company
[303.44s] in May of 2022. We thought we were
[306.88s] geniuses buying the stock in the fives.
[309.52s] Uh, and then it immediately went into
[311.36s] the threes and we bought more because we
[313.6s] had done our work. Uh, and the stock was
[316.0s] down because they needed to refinance
[317.6s] the debt. They did. that largely gives
[320.0s] them runway uh well to 2027 and beyond.
[323.919s] And we&#39;re going to talk a little bit
[325.12s] about that. We think well beyond. Uh and
[328.88s] uh the idea for getting involved in
[331.44s] Cooper Standard was actually uh a person
[334.639s] that I look up to tremendously who
[336.56s] recently passed is Charlie Mer. And
[339.52s] Charlie Munger did a very similar
[341.52s] investment in the
[343.72s] 2001 recession, a cyclical trough in the
[347.199s] industry. Uh, and this is a pretty
[349.52s] regular occurrence as Jeff will tell you
[351.759s] in the auto business. It is very
[353.8s] cyclical. Uh, and uh, Charlie read an
[356.72s] article in Baronss and he invested $10
[360.0s] million in Tenico when it was down some
[363.08s] 95%. They refinanced the debt. He turned
[366.0s] the 10 million into 80 million in a
[368.8s] reasonable amount of time and then he
[370.319s] gave that 80 million to Leelu who
[372.24s] invested in China which was out of fa
[374.16s] favor and turned it into a half a
[376.4s] billion dollars. So, two chess moves, a
[378.24s] half a billion dollars. That&#39;s the good
[379.919s] news. I think we&#39;re going to do a lot
[381.759s] better with Cooper Standard than Charlie
[383.919s] did in Tenico. And that&#39;s why we have
[386.639s] our very special guest again, chairman
[389.039s] and CEO of Cooper Standard, Mr. Jeff
[391.759s] Edwards. Thank you again. So, I think
[393.84s] I&#39;ll get right down to it here. Uh, and
[396.88s] I want to ask you some questions. I&#39;m
[398.96s] usually on the other side of the
[400.4s] question, so bear with me as an
[402.199s] interviewer. But um first question is in
[405.919s] your most recent conference call, you
[408.16s] provided guidance that suggests Cooper
[410.4s] Standard will continue to expand margins
[413.84s] in 2025 despite an expected decline in
[418.16s] North North American light vehicle
[420.72s] production and essentially flat revenue.
[423.84s] Uh you also mentioned launching new
[425.919s] business at higher variable contribution
[428.639s] margins than in the past. A few
[430.8s] questions here Jeeoff. Uh first is that
[433.28s] how you drive the margin expansion?
[435.599s] What&#39;s driving the higher uh uh margin
[438.56s] expansion the VCM? And how much higher
[442.08s] can this get? That&#39;s a good question,
[444.72s] Tom. And I I&#39;ll start by talking about
[447.28s] the things that we can control, right? I
[449.039s] mean ultimately um I I think the
[451.84s] industry we we talk a lot about uh about
[454.4s] price but to be fair uh with inside
[457.599s] Cooper Standard about four or five years
[459.599s] ago as we were facing what felt like uh
[463.84s] an insurmountable headwind uh be it
[466.88s] pandemics or be it uh industry downturn
[469.599s] whatever you want to call it. uh we
[471.759s] really turned our attention internal and
[474.319s] and started focusing on our our fixed
[476.8s] costs and and really driving fixed costs
[479.039s] to a uh an all-time low level as we sat
[482.8s] here today and our teams everywhere in
[485.52s] every region went to work on this
[487.28s] because basically what we said is we&#39;re
[489.12s] either going to make money in every
[491.12s] region with each of our two products or
[494.0s] we&#39;re going to do something else. Uh so
[496.479s] it really put a laser-like focus on on
[500.16s] uh those fixed costs which we&#39;ve taken
[502.08s] out consistently over the last five
[504.24s] years. So that&#39;s certainly driven a lot
[506.319s] of this margin expansion. Uh the other
[508.639s] thing that we did related to variable
[511.039s] contribution margin is we reestablished
[513.919s] what we felt were our fair hurdle rates
[516.64s] when we went into the customer and
[518.56s] started bidding on programs really in
[520.88s] each region with each each customer. uh
[523.44s] we established these hurdle rates and
[525.6s] and we found very quickly that that with
[528.0s] our technology and with our ability to
[529.92s] execute as well as we do that that those
[533.04s] price points were holding. And so in in
[536.56s] combination with taking the cost down,
[538.64s] controlling what we can control and at
[540.88s] the same time establishing a very clear
[543.279s] process internally so that every
[545.839s] salesperson and every leader, every
[548.32s] plant manager in the world understood
[550.399s] what those hurdle rates were. So they
[552.08s] were doing their part to take the cost
[553.76s] down and those people that go to the
[556.48s] customer to win new business had to make
[558.72s] sure that we did it at a price point
[560.8s] that was fair. Fair for the customer and
[562.8s] fair for us. And those were the two
[564.959s] reasons that you see the margin
[567.04s] expansion that you see. So we&#39;re really
[568.8s] proud of that. I I think probably most
[570.8s] importantly it&#39;s a sustainable uh
[573.279s] business model. So we&#39;ll continue to do
[575.279s] our fair share of taking costs out as we
[578.0s] improve efficiencies in our plants.
[580.24s] There&#39;s still a few things that we would
[581.68s] like to do around the world, but most of
[583.36s] it is is uh where we want it. The last
[587.2s] piece related to to what we can control
[589.6s] is our material cost as a percent of
[592.08s] sale. And this year, we&#39;re really
[594.08s] working with our supply base. Uh working
[597.04s] with our engineering teams to provide us
[599.44s] different options as it relates to the
[601.92s] decisions that we&#39;re taking related to
[604.16s] material costs for both our fluid and
[606.24s] our ceiling business. So we&#39;re not done
[608.16s] yet, but at least uh certainly the trend
[610.72s] is in the right direction. Fantastic.
[613.12s] Fantastic. So let&#39;s assume you can drive
[616.24s] a variable contribution margin of uh
[619.279s] improvement of around 500 basis points
[621.76s] over the next two to three years as
[623.6s] those new contacts uh contracts kick in
[626.24s] and and roll over. Um assuming an
[629.959s] apocalyptic scenario, which is I what I
[632.56s] like to do as an investor. uh if you if
[635.519s] you can underwrite the downside, the
[638.16s] upside will take care of itself. Um that
[641.6s] US production volumes don&#39;t even grow.
[643.839s] So So first cycle, and by the way, this
[646.8s] would be the first cycle peak since the
[649.399s] 1970s. That didn&#39;t peak over 18 million
[653.76s] plus units since 1970. And by the way,
[657.279s] back then the population was 40% less
[660.64s] than it is today. uh and we&#39;ll talk a
[662.88s] little bit about that. But this still
[664.88s] implies this is again apocalyptic
[667.04s] scenarios. We stay in the 15s. Um we&#39;re
[670.56s] looking at uh an additional 135 million
[673.92s] of IBIDA or total 330 million of IBIDA.
[678.72s] So if my math is correct, assuming these
[682.0s] apocalyptic volumes in the mid15s, this
[685.04s] business can earn5 to $6 a share two to
[688.56s] three years out on margin expansion
[690.959s] alone. Uh th this is a testament to how
[693.839s] you&#39;ve managed the business through this
[695.6s] ex extended cycle trough which uh
[698.56s] basically was a one in aundred year
[700.48s] event. I mean the pandemic and uh the
[702.959s] the industry cycle all at the same time.
[705.44s] So number one, is this a reasonable way
[709.2s] to think about the business? This is
[710.72s] kind of my my operating model. And if
[714.44s] so, say a little more how you did that
[717.04s] because it&#39;s it&#39;s just mindboggling to
[718.64s] me that that uh um your execution has
[723.399s] been so quick and so precise to put us
[726.639s] in a position that this is a reality.
[729.2s] Well, thank you. It&#39;s very kind.
[731.12s] I can&#39;t confirm the numbers that you
[732.8s] just rattled off there, but but I can
[734.88s] tell you that directionally you&#39;re
[736.639s] correct. Okay. And then how we how we
[739.6s] accomplish that, I guess, is probably
[741.2s] the most important thing. So really, I I
[743.519s] I mentioned it in the in the first
[745.6s] question, but but in addition to to
[748.88s] focusing on taking the cost down and and
[751.6s] being more consistent about the pricing
[753.76s] side as well, we reorganized here last
[757.92s] year. So we&#39;re we&#39;re about a year and a
[760.399s] quarter into this new organization
[762.399s] structure where where we have three
[764.8s] businesses now. We have our ceiling
[766.399s] business, we have our fluid business,
[768.24s] and then we have our industrial and
[770.48s] specialty product group, which is a much
[772.48s] smaller non-automotive business that we
[774.399s] have some good growth plans for. But
[776.88s] sticking primarily with sealing and
[778.639s] fluid for today&#39;s discussion, Tom, uh it
[781.279s] allowed us to put two presidents in
[782.959s] charge, one each of those businesses,
[785.04s] one for each of those businesses. We
[787.04s] gave them their own dedicated teams from
[789.2s] manufacturing to engineering to
[790.88s] purchasing everything they need uh
[793.2s] within their team to drive the
[795.8s] day-to-day performance of those
[797.76s] businesses. So uh didn&#39;t matter what 20
[800.839s] countries were doing business. It didn&#39;t
[803.279s] matter uh that that 21,000 employees
[807.44s] come to work every day, half of them in
[809.2s] each business. Uh but what are we going
[811.12s] to do? How are we going to get those
[812.8s] teams focused? Give them the resources.
[815.44s] give them the the investment dollars
[817.839s] that they need to grow the business
[819.6s] profitably, but at the same time hold
[821.6s] them accountable uh for driving uh VCM
[825.68s] margin expansion and ultimately
[827.44s] returning this business to double digit
[829.48s] EBIDA and double digit return on
[831.92s] invested capital and and that&#39;s exactly
[833.92s] what we saw happen uh in 2024 and why uh
[839.519s] our guidance for 25 suggests we&#39;re going
[842.0s] to return to those double-digit EBDA
[844.88s] numbers. numbers for both of those
[846.72s] businesses at the end of 25. Uh as we
[850.0s] start 20 uh6 we clearly will be a double
[854.079s] digit IBIDA and a double-digit return on
[857.199s] invested capital company. Okay, that&#39;s
[859.76s] that&#39;s great. Are you going to slide
[861.36s] back down the mountain? No. And why is
[864.0s] because the way we have structured these
[866.16s] two businesses, the leaders that we have
[868.48s] in charge, and we&#39;re not asking people
[870.88s] to do three and four jobs, right? they
[872.72s] they can stay focused within the lanes.
[875.199s] Our plants pretty much are divided up by
[877.519s] sealing and fluid. So there isn&#39;t a lot
[879.519s] of crosspollinization that that ever
[882.24s] really occurred in that business. So uh
[884.639s] I&#39;m very very proud of our plant
[886.88s] managers. You&#39;ve probably heard me say
[888.48s] that many times. We have great people in
[891.44s] those plants and are doing a fantastic
[893.36s] job. And and just keep in mind within
[895.519s] Cooper Standard about 85% of the 21,000
[899.12s] employees that work here every day go to
[901.44s] work for our plan managers. So now you
[904.32s] know why I wanted the focus to be within
[906.8s] those two products driving the
[908.88s] day-to-day execution and all that&#39;s
[911.12s] happening. And I didn&#39;t even get a
[912.639s] chance to talk about innovation, but I&#39;m
[914.24s] sure you&#39;ll ask me a couple questions as
[916.0s] we go forward here and I&#39;ll get into
[917.44s] that as well. Yeah. And you know, it&#39;s
[919.519s] funny as I&#39;ve followed the conference
[920.959s] calls along the way and had the chance
[922.56s] to meet with you at some of the investor
[924.24s] days. Uh I think that people are
[927.44s] surprised by two things. Number one, you
[929.44s] delivered or delivering on the
[932.24s] double-digit margins in such a short
[934.32s] period of time. I think people probably
[936.639s] said, I don&#39;t know, you know, a couple
[938.16s] years ago, a year and a half ago when
[939.92s] you were talking about that, the fact
[941.44s] you could get that done so quickly has
[943.36s] been positive. And I think the bigger
[945.12s] surprise is I think more people would
[947.279s] have guessed that number one you
[948.88s] couldn&#39;t do the double digits and number
[950.639s] two volumes would have been over 16
[953.759s] million. So on lower volumes to be able
[956.56s] to get that there this year is testament
[958.88s] to uh those employees and those plant
[962.0s] managers and yourself uh as referenced
[964.8s] as it relates to volumes though. I mean
[967.68s] I just continue to look at this and I
[969.519s] know you guys like to be conservative
[970.959s] and I hear you sometimes on that call. I
[972.959s] can tell you&#39;re super optimistic and
[974.72s] you&#39;re, you
[975.88s] know, I know you have a little
[977.92s] experience in golf, but I like golf.
[980.079s] There&#39;s something we call sandbagging
[981.68s] when guys come in and they say that
[983.36s] their handicaps are higher than they are
[985.12s] and then they win all the money at the
[986.639s] end of the day. Well, I I think that uh
[989.199s] we we may have something to be said for
[990.88s] that. And that&#39;s a good thing, not a bad
[992.48s] thing. Um, as it relates to just the
[995.519s] industry trends though, uh you&#39;re going
[998.16s] off the industry estimates. I think S&amp;P
[1000.639s] 15.1
[1002.16s] uh million production. But if you just
[1005.04s] step back when these cycles peaked,
[1007.36s] whether it was in
[1009.639s] 2005,
[1011.56s] 2017, 1987, all between 18 and 20 for
[1016.16s] for short periods of the spikes. You
[1018.32s] know, in the 80s, our population, the
[1020.72s] census was 226 million people. Now we&#39;re
[1023.68s] at 331 million people. So, uh, it it,
[1028.4s] you know, we&#39;re just looking for that 16
[1030.4s] to 18 or 17 to 18, but on the basis of
[1034.16s] population and the age of our population
[1036.4s] with so many people being 34, 35 when
[1038.64s] they buy new cars, um, I think we could
[1041.919s] wind up getting surprised dramatically
[1043.839s] to the upside. But that&#39;s just the
[1045.28s] whipped cream. We&#39;re we&#39;re dealing with
[1047.039s] basease scenarios. So, now that we&#39;ve
[1049.76s] gone through an apocalyptic scenario,
[1051.52s] Jeff, let&#39;s um go uh go through what it
[1055.28s] looks like uh for every cycle for the
[1058.32s] past 40 years when we peak between 17 to
[1061.039s] 18 million in production. Let&#39;s call it
[1063.28s] 17.5 million round numbers. By my
[1066.08s] calculation, CPS had approximately $99
[1069.76s] in revenue for every vehicle produced in
[1072.32s] North America in 2024 on a simple
[1075.84s] average basis. So, you know, round
[1078.0s] numbers, uh, let&#39;s call it 190 a carish
[1081.36s] for servicing half of the total cars,
[1083.919s] but let&#39;s just do it simply, 99 a car at
[1086.96s] a more historically normalized 17.5
[1090.08s] million peak production or 2 million
[1092.64s] more vehicles than last year. uh you
[1096.08s] would expect to gain nearly 200 million
[1098.559s] of additional revenue considering this
[1100.32s] is an operating leverage play and your
[1102.08s] break even is call it 15 to 15 and a
[1104.96s] half production free cash flow positive
[1107.6s] with most fixed costs in place we expect
[1110.96s] most of the incremental uh production to
[1113.6s] go to the bottom line at a higher uh VCM
[1117.28s] of approximately 35% this would be
[1119.76s] approximately 70 million in incremental
[1122.48s] profit or nearly four to $5 of $4 of
[1127.039s] additional EPS over our $5 to $6 EPS
[1131.44s] base case. I mean, round numbers at peak
[1134.559s] cycle production if it&#39;s
[1136.679s] 17.59 $10 a share in EPS base case from
[1140.08s] our side, not you know I I I know I know
[1142.559s] the position you&#39;re in. Uh this is re is
[1146.0s] this a reasonable not guaranteed in any
[1149.2s] way uh or any guidance way to think
[1152.0s] about it? In other words, if you were to
[1153.76s] say, &quot;Uh, Tom, look, I can&#39;t guarantee
[1156.0s] that, but your ar your argument is
[1158.0s] flawed here, here, and here.&quot; Uh, do you
[1160.559s] you can you legitimately say your my
[1162.88s] argument is flawed in that way of
[1164.72s] thinking about it if volumes normalize
[1166.96s] the way they have going back every
[1169.12s] single cycle for the last 40 years. And
[1171.76s] also uh not even accounting for the fact
[1174.08s] that the population uh was 32% lower in
[1177.6s] the 1980s.
[1180.0s] Yeah. First, I agree with your premise.
[1181.84s] Let&#39;s let&#39;s say it that way in in terms
[1184.08s] of uh the demand. We believe that that
[1187.28s] there is upside for many of the reasons
[1189.6s] that you you talked about. I I usually
[1192.48s] don&#39;t uh permit that discussion uh in
[1195.36s] this room because obviously uh we don&#39;t
[1197.76s] control it. So we tend to focus our
[1200.08s] attention on what we can control and not
[1203.12s] get too excited about what the what the
[1205.28s] volumes uh could be based on the type of
[1207.76s] of data that you just uh you just
[1209.919s] recited.
[1211.039s] But clearly uh Tom, we believe that
[1213.12s] there&#39;s there&#39;s uh pent-up demand. We
[1216.4s] also believe in in many of the reasons
[1218.72s] that you just described uh that this is
[1221.36s] just around the corner. But but most
[1223.6s] folks um that get paid to forecast
[1226.0s] automotive volume don&#39;t usually uh do
[1228.799s] that in advance. At least that&#39;s my
[1230.64s] experience over 40 years, I guess, is
[1232.96s] that uh we we tend to see them
[1235.76s] forecasting increases after the
[1237.6s] increases have started. uh doesn&#39;t work
[1240.159s] that way when it&#39;s going the other side.
[1241.6s] So, I&#39;m not sure why, but anyway, that&#39;s
[1243.36s] that&#39;s kind of how it how it goes. Your
[1245.679s] estimate for uh VCM is is also in the
[1248.799s] right range. So, we certainly uh are are
[1254.2s] u planning for uh an increase in volume.
[1258.88s] We just don&#39;t know when that&#39;s going to
[1260.32s] come. But, uh you mentioned guidance. So
[1262.72s] when I talked about the guidance here in
[1264.559s] the last earnings call for for 25, I
[1267.2s] mean we we were certainly uh
[1269.6s] conservative in in terms of uh this
[1272.4s] conversation, right? We used the the
[1274.72s] numbers typically all suppliers use uh
[1277.679s] S&amp;P to to help gauge what the what the
[1280.72s] next 12 months going to be and even what
[1282.96s] the next uh two or three years is is
[1285.6s] going to be. and and while there&#39;s some
[1287.52s] increases uh out there forecasted,
[1290.24s] they&#39;re certainly not the level that
[1291.679s] that you and I are hoping for or
[1293.52s] discussing uh with this particular
[1295.6s] question. But I&#39;m sure that uh increases
[1298.72s] are going to be coming. I just don&#39;t
[1300.72s] know when. Uh, but I also will say that
[1303.52s] that the numbers that we talked about on
[1305.84s] that last earnings call in in terms of
[1308.72s] what you&#39;re going to expect to see from
[1310.32s] our increasing EBDA each year, even on
[1313.12s] these suppressed volumes and our return
[1315.76s] on invested capital with these
[1317.76s] suppressed volumes. Um, it&#39;s it&#39;s very
[1320.559s] exciting because we&#39;re we&#39;re able to to
[1323.039s] make money and we&#39;ll be we&#39;ll be
[1324.72s] generating more and more cash each year
[1327.36s] without the increase in volume. So when
[1329.52s] they do come, uh, we&#39;re pretty excited
[1331.6s] about what that means for our company
[1333.2s] and and how much stronger it will be,
[1335.76s] uh, for the next couple decades as a
[1337.52s] result. So it&#39;s very exciting to think
[1339.36s] about, uh, I just don&#39;t really allow it
[1341.679s] to distract us because there&#39;s not much
[1343.36s] I can do about it. Yeah. In in my
[1345.44s] business, we say you you take care of
[1347.12s] the down, you protect the downside, the
[1349.2s] upside will take care of itself. And
[1350.72s] that&#39;s what you&#39;ve done through the
[1352.039s] execution and uh, right sizing the ship
[1354.72s] to be ready for for thing uh, good
[1356.799s] things coming forward. So, we appreciate
[1358.48s] that. Um, three key reasons I invested
[1362.0s] with you in May of 2022 and I remember
[1364.159s] we had a talk in August when we had a
[1366.72s] chance to meet that that time. Uh, and
[1368.96s] I&#39;ve continued to add a significant
[1371.039s] amount of shares uh across accounts and
[1374.0s] personally is number one I I want to
[1376.88s] acknowledge your respect for equity. Uh
[1379.36s] there are actually less shares
[1382.159s] outstanding today than in two 2017.
[1386.4s] uh about 17.56 million versus
[1390.679s] 17.69 on December 31st, 2017. Uh second
[1395.44s] reason was uh part of your compensation
[1397.84s] is tied to return on invested capital.
[1400.24s] That&#39;s a very important metric for me.
[1402.4s] Uh and three, you own a lot of stock.
[1404.48s] You&#39;re a partner. You know, you&#39;re we&#39;re
[1406.4s] investing right alongside with you and
[1408.4s] you have skin in the game, which is very
[1410.48s] important to us. Uh can you speak to
[1413.28s] your and and the board? you are the
[1415.679s] chairman but but the boards as well
[1417.919s] philosophy on all three of these
[1420.08s] concepts and why this culture is
[1422.24s] critical to owners as the cycle
[1424.84s] returns. Thanks. I yeah I think first of
[1427.36s] all the board the management team uh we
[1431.919s] we have a responsibility to behave in
[1435.76s] the best interest of all of our
[1437.36s] stakeholders of course but none more
[1440.48s] important than the shareholders. So, I I
[1442.32s] am very proud uh and you probably have
[1444.72s] seen the recent um insider buying
[1448.24s] activity that that&#39;s gone on. I will
[1450.08s] just say it. Our our lead director and
[1452.0s] our uh chief financial officer here in
[1454.72s] in the in the past month have have added
[1457.76s] to their uh their shares. I own 2% of
[1460.32s] the company sitting here as the chairman
[1462.0s] and CEO of of Cooper Standard. So, I can
[1464.72s] I can assure you that that it&#39;s in our
[1467.52s] own self-interest, but it&#39;s also uh our
[1470.24s] responsibility and we take it uh very
[1472.4s] serious and and I agree with you that
[1474.96s] that most investors um talk to me about
[1478.159s] that. They they want to understand uh
[1481.039s] the ownership and the requirements and
[1483.12s] how we&#39;re paid and what the long-term
[1484.88s] incentive plans are versus the annual
[1486.88s] incentive plans. and and I think we&#39;ve
[1489.12s] always uh prided ourselves all the way
[1491.919s] back to to 2012 to today that that those
[1496.32s] uh metrics and the way we&#39;re were
[1498.96s] measured in and the the compensation for
[1502.48s] for the management team aligns with
[1504.4s] shareholder expectations and values and
[1507.52s] uh obviously the last five or six years
[1509.6s] have been extremely challenging for a
[1511.279s] lot of reasons but uh at the end of the
[1513.84s] day I I&#39;m proud of the company I&#39;m proud
[1515.919s] to be a significant owner in the company
[1518.32s] and I I will continue to uh to make sure
[1521.12s] that we uphold that that standard. Yeah.
[1524.0s] Well, thank thank you for that. And for
[1525.52s] those of you just round numbers to put
[1527.44s] it in English, 2% of the company is, you
[1530.0s] know, give or take 350,000 shares. That
[1532.48s] is a serious partner right there. Uh uh
[1535.279s] we have
[1536.679s] uh more than that and we&#39;re excited to
[1539.36s] be a partner right alongside you. Uh uh
[1542.159s] but but pleased that um that&#39;s that&#39;s
[1544.76s] material. So, uh, next is we&#39;ve
[1547.919s] typically pointed to new vehicle
[1551.08s] incentives as a leading indicator for
[1554.4s] STAR. Uh, after after incentives as a
[1557.679s] percentage of the average transaction
[1559.76s] price bottomed out in September 2022 at
[1564.679s] 2.1%, we&#39;ve seen a strong recovery back
[1567.6s] to
[1568.76s] 7.2%, although that&#39;s still below the
[1571.72s] 9.8% average of the past two decades. In
[1575.2s] English, for those of you who are
[1576.4s] listening, if it&#39;s call it 10% of a
[1578.799s] $50,000 car, they would be giving 5,000
[1581.44s] incentives uh to get you down to the
[1583.76s] dealership to buy one. Uh with new
[1586.24s] vehicle prices seeing a significant jump
[1588.88s] over the past few years and an all-time
[1591.6s] record gap now between new and used
[1595.6s] average total prices. Could you comment
[1598.0s] on the role of incentives as a potential
[1600.48s] catalyst for new vehicle sales and
[1603.2s] improving profitability? And could you
[1605.44s] also share your thoughts on the
[1607.12s] relationship between incentives and
[1609.84s] overall production volumes?
[1613.36s] Sure, I&#39;d be happy to. And it&#39;s
[1614.96s] something that we track so it&#39;s easy for
[1616.72s] me to to tell you what we think there.
[1619.12s] Uh first of all, the constraints on
[1620.799s] produ production that really resulted
[1622.799s] from the from the pandemic and the
[1625.52s] supply chain uh disruptions uh that that
[1628.88s] followed. Uh I mean, I I sure hope it&#39;s
[1631.76s] a once in a-lifetime event. I can assure
[1633.679s] you it&#39;s the first time I&#39;ve seen
[1635.12s] anything like this in in the 40 years
[1637.6s] that I&#39;ve been part of this industry. So
[1639.84s] I I think that that as we move through
[1642.4s] it, um that&#39;s exactly what it&#39;ll be.
[1645.12s] it&#39;ll be history and and I don&#39;t think
[1647.2s] it&#39;s going to repeat itself anytime uh
[1650.08s] anytime soon. Uh but I do believe that
[1653.36s] that as inventories get reestablished
[1657.6s] and as supply chains uh smooth out and
[1660.96s] become normalized again uh that that
[1664.72s] there&#39;s just so many great vehicles. And
[1667.039s] you think about the three powertrains
[1669.52s] today, whether it&#39;s it&#39;s the ice engine,
[1672.72s] whether it&#39;s the battery electric
[1674.32s] vehicle, or whether you like something
[1675.84s] in between with plug-in hybrids. uh
[1679.44s] there&#39;s great great vehicles out there
[1681.6s] and and I think the competition uh has
[1684.48s] never been better and and so for
[1686.32s] consumers I I think that pent-up demand
[1688.72s] that you and I discussed earlier it it&#39;s
[1691.12s] a reality and and what I&#39;ve also seen
[1694.559s] over the course of of a few decades in
[1697.039s] the business is when that competition
[1699.44s] heats up incentives do start uh to build
[1703.2s] in fact we track that as part of a
[1705.6s] leading indicator within our company so
[1708.48s] that we maintain, you know, you get the
[1710.32s] you get the releases from the customers,
[1712.24s] which is what we we go to the bank with,
[1715.12s] uh, so to speak. Uh, but but incentives
[1718.24s] as as you see them increasing across the
[1720.72s] board, you typically see volume, uh,
[1723.76s] increase as well because dealers are
[1725.6s] moving the the product, the product is
[1728.0s] outstanding. It&#39;s world class. About
[1730.08s] anything you want, you can go get. Uh, I
[1732.72s] I do believe that u that we&#39;ve seen
[1735.44s] incentives increase last year. We&#39;ll see
[1737.84s] them increase this year and as a result
[1740.159s] you&#39;ll see u vehicles moving off of
[1743.12s] dealers lots at a faster pace and as a
[1745.84s] result you&#39;ll see production volumes
[1747.76s] increase to support that. That&#39;s what I
[1749.52s] believe. Thank you. And and god forbid
[1751.76s] we actually get uh Donald President
[1754.24s] Trump was talking about tax
[1756.039s] deductibility of uh interest on auto
[1759.84s] loans. That would be an additional
[1761.679s] kicker which is pretty wild. Uh this
[1764.159s] past quarter you announced that fluid
[1767.279s] the fluid handling segment sales are
[1769.2s] expected to increase by more than 50%
[1771.2s] over the next five years with the
[1773.2s] segments weighted average CPV cost per
[1775.679s] vehicle expected to go up by more than
[1777.52s] 30%. I know the ceiling systems business
[1780.48s] is pretty similar in terms of CPV across
[1783.039s] different powertrains, but could you
[1785.2s] share your thoughts on the outlook for
[1786.96s] the ceiling business and what kind of
[1788.72s] opportunities you see over the same time
[1790.48s] frame? Is that 30% uh CPV increase on
[1794.08s] the fluid handling baked into the margin
[1795.919s] expansion we discussed? Yeah. So for
[1798.559s] sealing, it&#39;s it&#39;s an interesting uh
[1800.88s] dynamic there, no pun intended, because
[1803.919s] part of the sealing business is called
[1805.52s] dynamic seals, and the other part is
[1807.2s] called static seals. I won&#39;t bore you
[1809.039s] with which is which, but in many cases,
[1812.08s] the automakers don&#39;t source all of the
[1815.279s] static and all of the dynamic to the
[1817.36s] same ceiling company. So in certain
[1819.44s] vehicles, uh there&#39;s more than one
[1822.159s] sealing company providing those those
[1824.559s] products. Uh so to answer your question,
[1827.039s] yes, there&#39;s an opportunity for us to
[1829.36s] considerably increase whether it&#39;s
[1832.0s] dynamic seal or whether it&#39;s static seal
[1834.48s] depending on which one we happen to have
[1836.24s] on a vehicle. And what would cause that?
[1838.799s] Well, our innovation would cause that
[1841.76s] because we have now just announced uh
[1844.399s] recently that that we have innovation
[1846.44s] for our our new static ceiling system.
[1849.84s] I&#39;m sorry, our dynamic ceiling system
[1852.159s] that would provide uh customers with the
[1854.96s] opportunity to source us for a product
[1857.679s] that would reduce their weight by 40%.
[1860.64s] Wow. And it&#39;s also um more recyclable
[1863.84s] than anything that they have in the
[1865.6s] marketplace. So, a 40% weight reduction
[1869.2s] uh for a particular ceiling system, I
[1871.36s] think, will help differentiate that
[1873.12s] business. So, let&#39;s see. We&#39;ve already
[1875.279s] been sourced on one major EV program.
[1878.48s] It&#39;s just out this year. I mentioned it
[1881.12s] in the last earnings call. So, I&#39;m very
[1882.72s] excited about that. So, uh how do we get
[1885.039s] more ceiling business innovate, provide
[1887.6s] our customers solutions that that they
[1889.84s] can only get from us helps drive their
[1892.399s] cost down, helps them meet their uh
[1894.96s] metrics as well as it relates to
[1896.84s] lightweing. Uh I believe our ceiling
[1899.2s] team will benefit from that all over the
[1901.36s] world. Uh and I know the the Chinese
[1903.6s] OEMs are looking at it right now in a in
[1905.919s] a big way. uh related to uh our fluid
[1909.12s] business. I mentioned that there&#39;s two
[1911.6s] things going on there. If I just use ICE
[1913.84s] vehicles as a baseline for our fluid
[1916.6s] business, if we have an all-electric
[1919.2s] vehicle, because of the complexity and
[1921.36s] the content, that that content per
[1924.24s] vehicle actually goes up about 20%. If
[1927.76s] you look at a ice vehicle versus a
[1930.32s] hybrid electric vehicle, the content of
[1932.96s] our fluid business goes up 80%. Uh so
[1936.399s] yes, we are rooting for more hybrids uh
[1939.84s] to hit the market. Fortunately, that is
[1941.84s] going to be the case, especially here in
[1943.519s] a North American market. And I know many
[1946.0s] people talk about the electric vehicle
[1948.24s] in China and how the perception is that
[1951.679s] it&#39;s just all electric. But I will tell
[1954.24s] you that about half of the vehicles that
[1956.72s] are being produced over there today, and
[1958.96s] it&#39;s a very very important fact for
[1961.679s] Cooper Standard, it&#39;s plug-in hybrid. So
[1965.039s] in addition to battery electric
[1967.08s] vehicles, they also have plug-in
[1969.44s] hybrids. So our fluid business in a
[1971.919s] market where 30 million units are being
[1974.559s] produced as we speak. Uh the opportunity
[1977.12s] to grow our China business is huge. And
[1979.84s] and uh they love our products and and
[1982.159s] we&#39;re doing quite well. We&#39;ve returned
[1983.679s] to a 10% uh EBDA already with our China
[1987.6s] business. Wow. uh despite the fact that
[1990.0s] the western OEMs are losing share and
[1992.72s] that was a big part of our our company
[1994.96s] in China in fact we were probably 90%
[1998.96s] 90% of our revenue was western OE just
[2002.64s] four years ago and obviously their their
[2005.519s] volumes have have come way down if I
[2008.24s] fast forward to 2026
[2011.84s] uh we will have replaced all of that
[2014.559s] revenue that we&#39;ve lost with Chinese
[2017.279s] domestics
[2018.32s] and we&#39;ll have increased it by over
[2020.0s] hund00 million. So our Chinese business
[2023.2s] is doing extremely well. Fluid uh is a
[2026.559s] big part of that, but also our ceiling
[2028.96s] business. So we&#39;re doing quite well in
[2030.799s] that region with our ceiling business
[2032.48s] too. So small fact uh uh related to to
[2036.64s] plug-in hybrids and in the Chinese
[2038.72s] market uh that not many people talk
[2040.96s] about, but but it is a fact. And it&#39;s
[2042.799s] interesting because the North American
[2044.32s] market as you well know uh was predicted
[2048.079s] or at least forecasted uh to go much
[2051.52s] faster related to EVs and you know there
[2053.919s] was the numbers out there 30% by by 2030
[2057.599s] which would have still been good for
[2059.04s] Cooper Standard. I think that&#39;s uh
[2061.839s] slowed down a little bit. I think it&#39;s
[2063.52s] still a fast growing market, but hybrid
[2066.159s] very quickly with every customer here in
[2068.72s] in the North American market, they are
[2071.119s] launching plans for hybrid uh vehicles.
[2073.599s] So again, our content goes up by 80% if
[2076.8s] a hybrid rolls off the end of the line.
[2078.639s] So it&#39;s a pretty cool fact. Yeah, that&#39;s
[2080.96s] absolutely amazing, Jeeoff. I think when
[2082.24s] I originally underwrote the investment
[2083.76s] in 2022, I had China at zero dollars and
[2088.56s] I think I had uh hybrids and EVs uh not
[2091.599s] even factored in into our internal
[2093.52s] models here. So all of this question I I
[2096.159s] guess I didn&#39;t answer the port the
[2097.52s] portion of the question that you said is
[2099.119s] that factored in what I just said for 25
[2101.68s] 26 and 27 and it is not.
[2106.079s] Wow. So there would be upside to that
[2108.079s] because the customers hadn&#39;t announced
[2110.72s] uh all these hybrids yet. They&#39;re just
[2112.48s] talking about um hybrids are coming,
[2115.2s] hybrids are coming and we really didn&#39;t
[2117.2s] have uh enough detail by customer as to
[2120.72s] what that meant and when they were going
[2122.48s] to be launching. Uh so these are the
[2125.599s] facts that we&#39;ll have that type of an
[2127.44s] increase in content per vehicle, but but
[2129.68s] it was too early to model it in in any
[2131.839s] of these financial numbers. So uh as as
[2134.56s] we book this business uh then we will
[2137.04s] update our our forecasts accordingly and
[2139.68s] I think last year the uh about 40% of
[2142.4s] the business that we booked was on on
[2144.88s] hybrid uh vehicles. So uh it&#39;s coming
[2148.56s] fast. Wow. Well that that is super
[2151.76s] exciting. Just just for those of you who
[2153.44s] haven&#39;t been following for for some time
[2155.44s] since 2022,
[2157.359s] um Cooper Standard in 2017 at the peak
[2163.119s] uh uh traded at $146 a share and earned
[2166.88s] about
[2168.119s] $719 a share. So it traded about a 20
[2170.96s] times multiple. We&#39;ve talked about our
[2173.28s] internal uh uh estimates with Jeff here
[2176.48s] of what we think the company can do on
[2178.4s] normalized volumes. So whether the
[2181.359s] market assigns us a 20 times multiple
[2183.68s] again on that bigger number we discussed
[2185.76s] earlier or a 10 times multiple the key
[2188.079s] is we think at Great Hill Capital and
[2190.64s] Tom Hayes opinion not advice uh consult
[2193.359s] with your financial advisor uh the
[2195.76s] upside is is phenomenal and and we just
[2198.48s] keep getting more information and things
[2200.16s] look more and more positive. All the
[2201.68s] things that we had underwritten to zero
[2203.359s] are now showing huge upside growth
[2205.52s] potential and we&#39;re pretty exciting. Uh
[2208.72s] over the past 2 years, Jeeoff, it looks
[2210.56s] like capex as a percentage of sales has
[2212.96s] been much lower, maybe 2 to 3% range
[2215.839s] compared to historically 5 to 6%. Given
[2218.88s] all the new business wins, do you see
[2220.96s] capex staying in this lower range moving
[2223.119s] forward or renormalizing?
[2225.92s] Yeah, we&#39;ve done a nice job of of
[2227.68s] managing capex through this uh this
[2230.32s] period of time. And and while I think
[2232.4s] it&#39;s probably unrealistic to I think we
[2234.32s] finished at 1.8% 8% uh in in
[2238.52s] 24. Uh it was that was a lot to do with
[2241.839s] the timing of the the launches of new
[2243.839s] programs and things like that. I I would
[2245.839s] say consider 3 to 3 and a half%. Uh I
[2249.359s] think that&#39;s probably where we&#39;ll we&#39;ll
[2251.68s] end up being being quote unquote in a
[2254.24s] normal range. And keep in mind a lot of
[2256.8s] that has been driven by just terrific
[2259.2s] work from our our manufacturing
[2261.76s] manufacturing engineering and product
[2263.52s] engineering folks. I mean probably five
[2266.16s] six years ago they started on this this
[2269.119s] uh track uh to make sure that that we
[2271.92s] are able to reuse the capital much more
[2274.4s] than we have in the past. They came up
[2276.56s] with standardized design so we didn&#39;t
[2278.48s] need as much capital variation as we did
[2281.2s] in the past. Worked with our customers
[2283.359s] to to get the specifications that we
[2285.599s] needed uh to really help on the capital
[2288.72s] side of the business. So from from all
[2291.52s] of our engineers to our customers
[2293.44s] engineers, uh this has really been a a
[2296.32s] success story. And in the days of us
[2298.8s] having to spend five or six% uh on on
[2302.56s] capital expenditures are are gone. Uh
[2305.52s] three to three and a half I think is
[2307.119s] probably the the more normal number
[2309.2s] going forward. That that&#39;s that&#39;s
[2311.2s] amazing amazing execution. All I can
[2314.16s] say. Um, a couple more here. After the
[2317.52s] announcement of the one-mon reprieve
[2319.839s] from the 25% tariff for US automakers,
[2322.8s] there&#39;s been talk that many automakers
[2324.64s] might start racing to build out
[2326.4s] inventories as quickly as possible. Is
[2328.64s] the industry expecting to see this trend
[2330.4s] play out? And what&#39;s your take on it?
[2333.92s] Yeah, I think it&#39;s it&#39;s uh interesting
[2336.16s] and and certainly the the volumes here
[2338.56s] in the first quarter uh I think the
[2341.92s] strong volumes in the first quarter
[2343.839s] probably are reflecting some of that
[2346.32s] sentiment. I guess I really don&#39;t I
[2349.04s] really don&#39;t know. I I I tend to to not
[2352.32s] get out ahead of my blockers and have
[2354.079s] these conversations. The blockers here
[2356.4s] are the customers and and the OEMs are
[2358.64s] dealing you know with this directly. But
[2361.2s] as it relates to the the supply base and
[2363.76s] the industry in general, I guess if if
[2365.68s] you&#39;ve been part of it for 40 years, uh
[2368.0s] it&#39;s okay to talk about it in its in its
[2370.68s] uh fullest context. I I really believe
[2374.16s] that that uh there&#39;s good intention, I
[2377.92s] think, being discussed
[2380.0s] um in Washington related to to tariffs
[2383.52s] and the industry. uh but I do think that
[2386.24s] that given the way the supply chain and
[2388.56s] given the way the OEMs
[2390.96s] uh have established the infrastructure
[2393.52s] and the overall business model it would
[2396.72s] be very very destructive in the short
[2399.44s] medium and and probably everything but
[2401.839s] the longest term you could think of uh
[2405.04s] to go this way. So, I I tend to think
[2408.0s] that if that&#39;s the case, and and
[2410.56s] nobody&#39;s looking for it to be that
[2412.4s] destructive, uh that it probably isn&#39;t
[2415.04s] going to be as as long or drawn out as
[2418.48s] maybe it would need to be in order for
[2420.8s] it to be productive. Uh so given that
[2423.68s] situation uh I&#39;m I&#39;m hopeful that uh
[2427.52s] that cooler heads will prevail and and
[2429.599s] we&#39;ll we&#39;ll manage through this in a way
[2431.76s] that that doesn&#39;t uh disrupt the
[2435.04s] momentum really that the industry has
[2437.359s] has built here and and we&#39;re talking
[2440.0s] about pent up demand. We&#39;re talking
[2441.599s] about great vehicles ready for market.
[2444.079s] We&#39;re talking about consumers that that
[2446.48s] for the first time hopefully are are
[2448.64s] going to be in a geopolitical
[2450.0s] environment that that gives them uh hope
[2453.2s] and and secondly in an overall economic
[2456.319s] environment that talks about lower
[2458.079s] interest rates and talks about uh GDP
[2461.359s] and and talks about inflation in
[2463.44s] positive terms and this again will
[2466.16s] create the the desire of for consumers
[2468.8s] to go out and and uh take advantage of
[2471.52s] the great vehicles that are available.
[2473.04s] And I I would just really u hesitate to
[2476.4s] think that that there would be a policy
[2479.359s] coming out of our government that would
[2481.359s] uh that would destroy that value and
[2483.119s] destroy that particular situation for
[2484.88s] the auto industry. It&#39;s just it takes
[2486.88s] too long to make the moves that that
[2489.76s] some folks think can be made uh by
[2492.64s] applying these tariffs. This is just my
[2494.48s] opinion. I&#39;m just a small supplier here
[2496.96s] in Northville, Michigan, so I probably
[2498.64s] don&#39;t catch the whole the drift of the
[2500.88s] whole thing. But, uh, you know, that&#39;s
[2502.72s] my that&#39;s my personal opinion on it,
[2504.48s] Tom. Yeah. And and the question is
[2506.079s] whether people are going to spend tens
[2508.079s] of billions of dollars to stand up
[2509.52s] factories in, you know, Mississippi for
[2511.76s] three and a half years when the
[2513.04s] factories won&#39;t even be built by the
[2514.64s] time the rules change again. But that&#39;s
[2516.64s] another story we could talk about. Um uh
[2520.079s] looking at the current industry outlook,
[2522.88s] North American light vehicle production
[2524.319s] is expected to come in at 15.1 million
[2527.119s] with SAR projected between 16.0 to 16.3.
[2531.359s] And I got to say when that press release
[2533.68s] came out for Q1, I was like, wait a
[2536.319s] second. I I had the uh SAR and
[2539.839s] production numbers overlaid for 20some
[2542.48s] years, and it&#39;s basically the same line.
[2544.24s] And I&#39;m like, how did they get this
[2546.2s] million gap sandbagging me on this call?
[2549.839s] But anyway,
[2552.04s] uh there have been instances. They&#39;re
[2554.88s] not very common, Jeff. I just want to
[2557.04s] say. Uh but if these forecasts hold, it
[2560.64s] would be one of the largest production
[2562.64s] deficits we&#39;ve seen in quite some time
[2564.88s] with the only other times being coming
[2566.64s] out of the pandemic and before that the
[2568.96s] 2008 financial crisis. Every time we&#39;ve
[2572.24s] had a deficit of over 1 million units,
[2575.04s] again, very rare. Jeff, uh, production
[2578.16s] has usually had a hockey stick style
[2580.4s] recovery in the following years. What
[2582.24s] are your thoughts on this kind of
[2583.359s] production catchup? And what sort of
[2585.52s] implications do you expect if current
[2587.599s] forecasts hold true? Yeah. Well, I, as I
[2591.52s] said a couple times, I I believe we&#39;ll
[2593.76s] see a ramp up in production volume. I
[2596.88s] just wish I could predict uh when, but I
[2600.319s] think it&#39;s sooner than than later. I I
[2602.8s] agree with uh with your statement. Uh
[2605.68s] and we&#39;ve certainly changed our
[2608.079s] strategy, right? I I talked about how we
[2610.0s] changed the entire uh organization
[2612.8s] structure of of the company. Uh we&#39;ve
[2615.52s] certainly gone all in as it it relates
[2618.24s] to to our capital strategy and to to
[2621.44s] driving innovation, investing in
[2623.52s] innovation and providing customers with
[2625.52s] solutions that that otherwise they they
[2628.56s] wouldn&#39;t have had. So uh we believe that
[2631.52s] it&#39;s uh that it&#39;s here. We believe that
[2634.319s] we&#39;ll see it. We believe that our
[2635.839s] products will be in a greater demand. Uh
[2638.4s] and certainly any incremental production
[2640.16s] volume over over the period of of the
[2642.88s] next few years is just going to make
[2645.119s] things that much better for us and for
[2646.96s] all suppliers because we all know that
[2649.359s] as volumes go up, suppliers do a whole
[2651.839s] lot better. And uh I think all of us
[2654.24s] have done a very good job of weathering
[2655.839s] the storm. We&#39;ve all managed, you know,
[2658.079s] nobody&#39;s sitting over in the corner
[2659.52s] whining about what&#39;s happened the last
[2661.119s] six years. We&#39;ve focused on what we can
[2663.119s] control. We&#39;ve managed our business. And
[2665.28s] I think the supply base uh is is strong
[2668.48s] as a result of it. But you know, we&#39;re
[2670.72s] not going to be able to absorb tariffs.
[2672.48s] We&#39;re not going to be able to uh absorb
[2675.04s] material economics. We&#39;re not going to
[2676.56s] be able to do those things. But but
[2678.56s] clearly we&#39;re going to be able to run
[2680.16s] our factories very efficiently. And
[2682.079s] we&#39;ll be able to provide great products
[2684.64s] uh and great services to our customers.
[2686.4s] And I think that that&#39;s proven for us to
[2688.48s] be the winner, right? We launch great,
[2690.72s] we execute well, and our customers
[2693.52s] continue to give us more business. They
[2695.04s] all vote with purchase orders, Tom.
[2696.72s] That&#39;s just how it works. Yeah. And and
[2699.04s] over the last two or three years, I
[2700.8s] mean, we&#39;re we&#39;re almost at record highs
[2703.44s] in terms of booking new business. So,
[2705.119s] we&#39;re really proud of that. Yeah. No,
[2707.28s] it&#39;s it&#39;s phenomenal. Um uh last last
[2709.92s] couple here and then we&#39;ll do a couple
[2711.359s] fun ones and wrap it up. As you return
[2713.28s] to double-digit margins and return on
[2715.04s] invested capital and continue to
[2716.8s] generate strong cash flows, you
[2718.56s] mentioned not only the expectation of
[2720.16s] having various options to manage
[2721.68s] upcoming debt and improve the cost of
[2724.0s] capital, but also the goal of reaching
[2725.839s] two times leverage by the end of
[2728.28s] 2027 without even contemplating a refi.
[2732.079s] Since there are no major refinancings
[2734.4s] needed till 2027 and a dimminimous 43
[2737.76s] million in November 2026,
[2740.319s] uh do you need to do you need to address
[2742.96s] the capital structure this year? And
[2745.2s] assuming a bump in production from the
[2747.2s] front-loading production in March or the
[2749.28s] first quarter and a modest continued
[2752.319s] moderation in rates, is there a view to
[2755.2s] possibly wait for a credit upgrade or
[2757.599s] some other event before taking that
[2759.68s] action? That&#39;s a great question and and
[2762.16s] certainly you&#39;re right. We don&#39;t have an
[2764.119s] urgent requirement to deal with it right
[2766.96s] now. I I think if we if I would put a
[2769.28s] time frame on it and I had my magic
[2771.319s] wand, you know, sometime between this
[2774.56s] summer and and next year&#39;s first quarter
[2778.64s] uh would be ideal. And and why do I say
[2780.64s] that? because that that gives us an
[2782.319s] opportunity quarter by quarter to
[2784.079s] continue to put points on the
[2785.56s] scoreboard, continue to show the
[2787.76s] improvement is sustainable within the
[2789.92s] business, continue to improve the the
[2792.48s] EBDA and continue to improve the return
[2794.48s] on invested capital, continue to
[2796.24s] generate uh better cash flow and at the
[2798.88s] same time I I truly believe that the
[2801.44s] geopolitical environment uh in in
[2804.24s] turning down the the temperature of the
[2806.56s] world uh is going to occur during this
[2809.68s] same period of time and I also believe
[2811.839s] that we&#39;ll continue to see uh strong
[2814.56s] economic uh metrics that will allow the
[2818.56s] interest rates to continue to come down
[2820.64s] and at the same time you know you
[2822.72s] mentioned the two time two times
[2824.72s] leverage well you know that&#39;s a journey
[2826.64s] from where we are today to to two times
[2829.04s] but there&#39;s a couple other pretty
[2830.319s] important points along that journey
[2832.72s] right if we got to four times that&#39;s
[2834.319s] better than where we are today and that
[2836.48s] would result in in a significant
[2838.72s] improvement probably in in the rates
[2840.56s] that we would be able to to talk to the
[2842.4s] the institutions about and and certainly
[2845.44s] they they will have visibility uh into
[2848.4s] that that two times or better journey
[2850.48s] that we&#39;ve that we&#39;ve been very open
[2852.64s] openly discussing. Uh and and then as
[2855.68s] we&#39;ve discussed if that is is uh built
[2858.88s] on top of volume improvements then it&#39;s
[2862.24s] just going to make it that much that
[2863.839s] much better. But um I I think we&#39;ve done
[2866.72s] a really good job of getting ourselves
[2868.64s] in a position uh to to be able to be
[2872.0s] patient over the course of the next year
[2874.24s] or so uh and and and hopefully find
[2877.28s] ourselves in a better overall economic
[2879.04s] environment and then the company uh will
[2881.44s] have have probably to your point
[2883.44s] received an upgrade along that journey
[2885.92s] and then that might be the better time
[2887.76s] to to pull it and and I think that&#39;s
[2890.72s] that&#39;s probably how we&#39;re uh thinking
[2892.72s] about it. We certainly uh at the same
[2895.28s] time we don&#39;t want to to let the
[2897.04s] existing long-term debt become current
[2898.88s] debt either. So yeah, you know, there&#39;s
[2900.56s] an incentive on on both sides of this
[2903.52s] and and the relationships we have with
[2905.599s] the banks and and the ability to to do
[2908.24s] what we&#39;ve said we were going to do for
[2909.839s] all these uh many quarters and and many
[2912.88s] years I think will also help in the
[2914.559s] conversation. Yeah. And and I think
[2916.8s] what&#39;s implicit what I was getting to in
[2918.96s] English for our viewers and investors is
[2922.24s] uh implicit in that two times over time
[2924.96s] is is effectively the operating leverage
[2927.2s] in the business. This this thing as
[2929.28s] volumes normalize can print more money
[2931.28s] than the US
[2933.079s] Treasury. Uh you don&#39;t have to comment
[2935.28s] on that one. Uh the the last thing is on
[2937.52s] everyone&#39;s mind. If a good portion of
[2939.52s] your production is in Mexico due to the
[2941.68s] fact that that&#39;s where the OEM factories
[2944.24s] are and that&#39;s where they wanted you to
[2945.92s] be, uh, are you mostly shipping your
[2948.64s] products to the OEM plants in Mexico and
[2951.359s] not across the border? I.e., uh, as it
[2954.319s] stands, you wouldn&#39;t really be impacted
[2956.72s] by tariffs if that is the case. And how
[2959.44s] much impact do you expect from proposed
[2961.68s] tariffs if in fact they go through as
[2964.079s] advertised? and is uh uh if there is any
[2968.24s] material exposure, how do you expect to
[2969.92s] manage it? Yeah. Well, we certainly do
[2972.88s] ship uh a lot of our product uh back
[2975.92s] across the border from Mexico. Uh a lot
[2978.8s] of it is used in Mexico as well. So,
[2981.119s] let&#39;s just say it&#39;s it&#39;s probably a
[2982.96s] little bit over half though that comes
[2984.96s] back uh at the request of our of our
[2987.24s] customers uh here in the US. Uh so, it&#39;s
[2990.88s] it&#39;s significant to us. Uh I think
[2993.68s] that&#39;s probably the good news that it&#39;s
[2995.28s] significant to us and it&#39;s significant
[2997.119s] to the entire industry. So it isn&#39;t a
[2999.92s] sustainable uh situation and and we
[3003.72s] obviously anticipate and so we&#39;ve been
[3006.48s] providing our customers all along with
[3008.8s] this information. So, it&#39;s not a
[3010.52s] surprise. Every single OEM that we&#39;re
[3013.52s] dealing with here in the United States,
[3015.76s] uh, is very aware of of what the impact
[3019.119s] would be to each and every supplier and
[3022.0s] and their vehicles as well. Uh, and
[3024.8s] they&#39;re having conversations with us
[3026.48s] about how do you deal with it? And so,
[3029.119s] uh, there isn&#39;t any way that that a
[3031.92s] supplier can deal with a 25% tariff on
[3034.8s] half the product that that&#39;s coming from
[3037.28s] from Mexico to the US. So in our case,
[3039.68s] like most uh there would have to be a a
[3042.72s] conversation and a and a way that the
[3045.68s] that the OEMs are going to absorb it uh
[3048.48s] in order for it to be u sustainable for
[3051.44s] the for the industry. But it&#39;s so large
[3054.24s] and and ultimately would all be passed
[3056.4s] on to the consumer at the end of the
[3058.24s] day. And that gets into that
[3060.4s] conversation you and I had about wow
[3062.88s] then you would be really destroying
[3065.44s] value. This this isn&#39;t sustainable. it
[3068.0s] doesn&#39;t work even for a minute uh let
[3070.559s] alone a month. Uh so I&#39;m hoping that
[3073.2s] between now and April 2nd uh this gets
[3076.0s] figured out and and uh we don&#39;t have
[3078.319s] this distraction as an industry uh to
[3081.28s] deal with because it wouldn&#39;t be fun.
[3083.359s] Yeah, makes makes perfect sense. Um
[3086.48s] since I know Cooper St a couple fun ones
[3088.8s] here since I know Cooper Standard is is
[3090.96s] doing a lot with AI these days. Uh the
[3094.16s] final two bonus questions are AI
[3096.4s] generated complements of Grock, which is
[3099.119s] Elon Musk&#39;s AI. You know, it&#39;s funny.
[3101.76s] People uh when Nvidia was trading at
[3103.68s] $152,
[3105.359s] uh everyone said, &quot;What are you doing
[3106.559s] for AI?&quot; I said, &quot;I&#39;m doing this company
[3108.559s] called Commtock Resources. They they&#39;re
[3110.64s] a natural gas play and it was $8 and
[3113.44s] change. Now it&#39;s up close to $20.&quot; And
[3116.0s] then people were like, &quot;No, really? What
[3117.28s] are you doing about AI?&quot; I was like,
[3118.48s] &quot;Well, I&#39;m doing this thing called
[3119.839s] Alibaba. It was under well under a
[3121.839s] hundred bucks. Now it&#39;s 145 going to
[3124.24s] 200. It may be that Cooper Standard is
[3126.64s] going to be the AI play of 2025 with
[3129.44s] everything going on. But leaving that
[3131.599s] aside, here&#39;s the first question from
[3133.599s] Grock. Uh suggested that I ask you.
[3136.16s] Again, all of this is opinion, not
[3138.16s] advice. This is not recommendations.
[3140.16s] Talk to your financial advisor. This is
[3142.0s] not guidance. This is a conversation. Uh
[3144.64s] so here&#39;s what Grock says. Jeff, if you
[3147.04s] were an investor or or if if you were an
[3149.28s] investor with $1 million to deploy, why
[3152.079s] would you put it all into Cooper
[3153.76s] Standard stock right now? Now, we would
[3155.839s] never recommend anyone puts 100% of
[3158.079s] anything into one stock, but uh but
[3160.64s] that&#39;s the question. So, give us uh some
[3162.559s] guidelines here, Jeff. Yeah, as I
[3164.64s] mentioned in the conversation, Tom, I
[3166.64s] mean, because we&#39;ve taken care of our
[3168.96s] own business, right? We&#39;ve over the last
[3171.2s] 5 years, we&#39;ve established a cost base
[3173.76s] that allows the company to flourish. Uh
[3176.72s] we&#39;ve already put enough points on the
[3179.04s] scoreboard to tell you that by the end
[3180.88s] of 2025, we&#39;re going to be at double
[3183.68s] digit EBDA and we&#39;re going to be at
[3185.76s] double digit return on invested capital.
[3188.24s] And then when we forecast and just look
[3190.079s] out a few years from that point, uh
[3192.72s] we&#39;ve said that our net leverage is
[3194.4s] going to be uh two times or less. All of
[3198.24s] those statements are on the volumes that
[3200.64s] exist today and a very slight increase
[3203.92s] in forecast over the course of the next
[3206.319s] three years. Uh so if I would look at
[3209.2s] that and and I would be an investor, I
[3211.44s] would say, &quot;Wow, there&#39;s a company
[3212.64s] that&#39;s delivering results. There&#39;s a
[3215.119s] company that that has uh told us that
[3218.16s] the that they&#39;re going to return to the
[3220.0s] type of prosperity that they exist that
[3222.24s] existed back in the
[3224.2s] 2017 period of time that you mentioned
[3226.96s] earlier was $140 stock price. I&#39;m not
[3229.599s] predicting that. I&#39;m just telling you
[3231.44s] that I I know what that feels like and I
[3233.92s] know what it feels like today and I know
[3236.24s] what the industry pent up demand is for
[3238.48s] the next three or four years. So with
[3240.72s] that, uh, it&#39;s pretty tough to find, I
[3243.44s] think, a company in an industry that&#39;s
[3245.599s] better positioned than than what we are.
[3248.0s] Love it. And, uh, this one is is also
[3251.04s] from Grock, and it&#39;s interesting that
[3252.72s] they mentioned Warren Buffett because,
[3254.72s] uh, I look up to him a lot. A lot of our
[3256.48s] framework is similar. Uh, if you had to
[3259.839s] pitch Cooper Standard to Warren Buffett,
[3261.92s] what&#39;s the number one metric you&#39;d want
[3264.24s] to prove this is a cash machine worth
[3266.48s] owning?
[3268.079s] I think we talked about this. Uh I own
[3270.0s] over 350,000 shares of Cooper Standard
[3272.8s] stock. Uh that&#39;s about 2% of the
[3275.2s] company. Uh so that&#39;s I think putting my
[3278.16s] uh money where my mouth is. And it also
[3281.2s] uh for me is probably the most important
[3283.04s] metric. And I I can I could talk to you
[3284.96s] about all the other company metrics, but
[3286.48s] I&#39;ll just stick to that personal one. I
[3288.4s] love it. I love it. And final question,
[3290.079s] Jeff, is there anything else we didn&#39;t
[3291.68s] cover that you&#39;d like to share with our
[3293.28s] audience of investors today? I think
[3295.76s] we&#39;ve covered it all. I just I&#39;m I&#39;m
[3297.599s] excited about the future. I&#39;m excited
[3299.359s] about Cooper Standard. I mean, we have
[3301.119s] great employees. We&#39;ve talked a lot
[3302.559s] about our product. We haven&#39;t talked
[3304.0s] much about our culture today. But it
[3306.16s] isn&#39;t just the what we make, it&#39;s how we
[3308.24s] do it. And and I&#39;m so proud of the uh of
[3311.28s] the 21,000 employees that call this
[3313.92s] home. And we don&#39;t have a lot of
[3315.28s] turnover. Uh we have great people. It&#39;s
[3317.68s] not the sign on the building that makes
[3319.28s] us Tom. It&#39;s the people within the
[3320.8s] buildings. And and I&#39;m really proud of
[3322.48s] that fact. So that&#39;s how I would end it.
[3324.48s] Thank you very much for the
[3325.52s] conversation. Well, well, thank you so
[3327.52s] much for joining us. Very grateful for
[3329.28s] you taking the time. That&#39;s chairman and
[3331.76s] CEO of Cooper Standard, Jeff
[3336.76s] Edwards. And we&#39;re back. So, comment
[3339.76s] below at YouTube with your number one
[3342.839s] takeaway of the interview with Jeff
[3346.319s] Edwards and the top 10 takeaways. We
[3349.92s] will get you out one of these incredible
[3352.799s] hats. So, uh, moving along, want to
[3356.52s] thank Jake Mack and Taylor Riggs for
[3359.52s] having me on the Clayman Countdown Fox
[3361.76s] Business. This week, we got to discuss,
[3364.559s] uh, two of my favorite companies,
[3366.88s] Alibaba and Lip Booan for Intel. Listen
[3371.839s] in here. But are markets, at least
[3374.079s] today, looking through the data and
[3376.88s] focusing on the fundamentals of some of
[3379.28s] these companies, which do indeed remain
[3381.68s] strong. Joining us now, I&#39;m pleased to
[3383.76s] say, region&#39;s chief investment officer
[3385.92s] Alan Mcnite and Great Hill Capital
[3388.48s] Chairman Thomas Hayes. Alan, let me
[3391.44s] start with you because today it does
[3393.52s] feel like that pushpull where you get
[3396.24s] economic data, but then you&#39;re looking
[3398.24s] at the Fed or the tariff put and
[3400.24s] thinking maybe this is actually good
[3402.48s] news for the market. What do you think?
[3404.4s] I think it is and I think what we&#39;re
[3405.599s] seeing today is that markets may have
[3407.2s] been oversold a bit as we went through
[3408.799s] last week and it was just the absence of
[3410.48s] information. So now with a little bit
[3412.0s] more information when you think okay
[3413.68s] retail sales was maybe not as good but
[3416.24s] not horrible when you hear some of the
[3418.16s] commentary coming out from various
[3419.44s] companies I think it gives a little
[3421.28s] confidence to investors to realize that
[3424.24s] it&#39;s not as bad as everyone anticipated
[3426.16s] and the old ruddyard kipping if if you
[3428.559s] can keep your head about you when others
[3429.92s] are losing theirs that&#39;s what we&#39;re
[3431.52s] getting today Tom weigh in here because
[3433.92s] everything that I&#39;ve heard is there&#39;s
[3435.839s] going to be a lot of uncertainty until
[3437.68s] April 2nd but then we&#39;re getting clarity
[3440.16s] around risk reciprocal tariffs. We may
[3442.48s] bottom out later on mid year and then we
[3444.72s] rally into the end of the year. How do
[3446.88s] you think about this
[3448.92s] uncertainty? Well, Taylor, I think
[3450.88s] Warren Buffett said it best. Be greedy
[3452.88s] when others are fearful. And every
[3455.28s] single fear indicator is completely
[3457.119s] washed out. The AI sentiment showed just
[3460.319s] 19% of retail investors were bullish
[3462.88s] last week. They bought record puts after
[3465.92s] the market was down. you want to buy
[3467.52s] that house insurance before the fire. Uh
[3470.88s] and hedge funds were record selling
[3473.2s] stocks in the hole. These are all
[3474.96s] contrarian indicators and this is when
[3476.72s] we look for opportunities. We&#39;re seeing
[3478.88s] the Fed put back in play for June. 82%
[3482.72s] chance of a cut in June. And talking
[3484.64s] about some of the fear gates, you&#39;re
[3485.92s] looking at the VIX which is down with a
[3487.76s] 20 handle which sort of reflects the
[3489.68s] calmness at least today that we see in
[3492.16s] the market. So Alan, I want to know
[3493.68s] what&#39;s on your shopping list because I
[3495.28s] think a lot of people last week were
[3496.96s] getting a little nervous like, &quot;Oh my
[3498.64s] gosh, is the bottom here? Is there more
[3500.96s] room to run?&quot; But on the other hand,
[3502.72s] people are like, &quot;Look, everything is
[3504.559s] 10% on sale now. And if I liked a
[3506.96s] sweater at 100, I like it even more at
[3509.2s] 90.&quot; What&#39;s sort of on your shopping
[3510.96s] list? Well, by the way, I like to
[3512.079s] reinforce that with my three daughters.
[3513.599s] I wish they would follow it more often.
[3515.44s] Um, but the bottom line is that we still
[3517.359s] think communication services, we think
[3519.359s] utilities look cheap here, and it&#39;s all
[3521.119s] about the earnings. And I think we&#39;re
[3522.48s] going to see as we get into first
[3523.92s] quarter earning season, if you can
[3525.68s] continue to buy companies that are
[3527.04s] delivering earnings in excess of 10 15%
[3529.359s] growth, it pays to go shopping when
[3531.44s] things are on sale. And we&#39;re seeing
[3532.88s] utilities and AI play still. It is. And
[3535.2s] I think that&#39;s where utilities is now a
[3536.799s] growth name. And if you had told me 10
[3538.48s] years ago I would buy utilities for the
[3540.079s] growth, I would have said you&#39;re crazy.
[3541.68s] But today you look at the type of growth
[3543.2s] they can generate because of data center
[3545.119s] growth, because of AI that is fueling
[3547.119s] that data center growth. And suddenly
[3548.96s] you&#39;re really seeing an opportunity
[3550.319s] there, particularly in the southeast
[3551.839s] part of the country where you&#39;re seeing
[3553.2s] continued population demand as well.
[3555.599s] Tom, um I&#39;m not calling you crazy, but a
[3559.52s] lot of people might call you crazy when
[3561.68s] I look and one of your top picks right
[3563.359s] now is Intel. This is a great storied
[3566.079s] American company. They just announced, I
[3568.799s] believe on Friday, a new CEO, but this
[3571.359s] is a company that has struggled. Why
[3573.839s] Intel? And why Intel at
[3576.04s] $25?
[3577.76s] Well, Taylor Lip Bhutan is the new CEO.
[3580.72s] He came from Cadence Designs when the
[3583.04s] stock was down
[3584.599s] 86% in 2009. If you had invested $1
[3588.72s] million when he became CEO, by the time
[3591.76s] he stepped down 14 years later in 2023,
[3594.96s] that $1 million became $68 million. Lip
[3599.52s] Bhutan is a miracle worker and Intel
[3602.0s] needs a miracle and I think they&#39;re
[3603.839s] going to get it. You know, the key thing
[3605.52s] here is Nvidia&#39;s growth rate has
[3608.599s] decelerated, not for lack of demand, but
[3611.119s] for lack of supply. TSMC is at capacity.
[3614.48s] Intel in the background has been
[3616.16s] building up the fabs. They&#39;re ready for
[3618.24s] prime time. Nvidia&#39;s testing chips.
[3620.96s] Broadcom is testing chips. And Lip
[3623.44s] Bhutan is going to spike the football in
[3625.28s] the end zone. We&#39;re very excited about
[3627.2s] Intel. And it&#39;s trading just a couple
[3629.119s] bucks over tangible book value. So, if
[3630.96s] they liquidated the whole company today,
[3632.72s] you get most of your money back. And if
[3634.4s] he does what he could do, which we know
[3636.319s] he can, it could be a double and beyond
[3638.0s] in the next 12 to 24 months. But Tom, a
[3640.24s] lot of people are thinking that Intel I
[3642.4s] mean I&#39;ve heard um you know not rumors
[3645.92s] but you know words used like they&#39;re
[3648.319s] selling the car for parts, right? Where
[3650.319s] you had rumors about Broadcom, TSMC
[3653.52s] coming and looking at different portions
[3655.04s] of the business. Do you like it as a sum
[3657.359s] of the whole or do you like it as
[3659.119s] different parts?
[3661.119s] Look, if they sell it off for parts, we
[3663.04s] probably get 3540 bucks when all is said
[3665.119s] and done. Lit Bhutan has stated he&#39;s
[3667.119s] going to run this business. He&#39;s not
[3668.559s] interested in a fire sale. He&#39;s going to
[3670.48s] turn this into a multibagger. Everything
[3672.48s] is there. Actually, Gellzinger did lay
[3674.319s] the found foundry uh uh framework to
[3677.599s] move ahead and to supply the Nvidia and
[3679.76s] the Broadcoms of the world. Lip Bhan is
[3682.079s] going to finish that execution at the
[3684.0s] five yard line, take it in for a
[3686.4s] touchdown. This is going to be, look, it
[3688.799s] was on no one&#39;s bingo card at the
[3690.319s] beginning of this year that Nvidia would
[3691.839s] be among the worst chip producers this
[3694.16s] year in terms of performers. And Intel
[3696.24s] is now the top performing semiconductor
[3699.76s] company for year-to- date 2025.
[3704.24s] Okay. I think people might say that says
[3706.799s] more about Nvidia than it does about
[3709.04s] Intel. We&#39;ll see. But Tom, I do like the
[3711.28s] bull call. Ellen, you know, you talked
[3713.599s] in break with me about just
[3715.599s] diversification is winning right now.
[3717.839s] Fixed income, international, and this
[3720.4s] sort of plays into what we heard from
[3721.76s] Scott Besson over the weekend about how
[3724.0s] ignore some of the volatility. It&#39;ll all
[3726.16s] work out. Take a listen to what he had
[3727.68s] to say.
[3729.92s] I can tell you that corrections are
[3732.319s] healthy. They&#39;re normal. What&#39;s not
[3734.64s] healthy is straight up that you get
[3737.68s] these euphoric markets. That&#39;s how you
[3739.68s] get a financial crisis. It would have
[3741.599s] been much healthier if someone had put
[3743.359s] the brakes on in &#39; 06 07, we are going
[3746.16s] to have a transition and we are not
[3748.64s] going to have a crisis.
[3751.359s] So again, corrections are healthy, but
[3754.16s] if the diversification for you is what&#39;s
[3756.48s] key within navigating the correction,
[3759.52s] that&#39;s exactly right. Secretary Besson
[3761.04s] is spot on in this idea that it&#39;s very
[3763.2s] normal for markets to go down. So if you
[3765.119s] look over history over the last 100
[3766.64s] years, you should expect a 10%
[3768.24s] correction every year and three 5%
[3770.559s] corrections every year. So it&#39;s not
[3772.799s] abnormal. It&#39;s just that we&#39;ve had these
[3774.24s] two excessive years of 23 and 24 where
[3777.44s] everything worked. It&#39;s going to grind a
[3779.44s] little more this year as investors start
[3781.28s] to understand what&#39;s happening and the
[3782.88s] only free lunch investing is
[3784.48s] diversification. So international has
[3786.799s] performed better, fixed income has
[3788.559s] performed better. So a fully diversified
[3790.319s] portfolio actually looks very good right
[3792.0s] now. And then to your point earlier
[3793.359s] about buying some things on sale, you
[3795.039s] can now actually rebalance a little bit
[3796.88s] to pick up some of these domestic names.
[3798.64s] Tom, final thoughts to you.
[3801.599s] Yeah, I look, we continue to like China
[3803.839s] and people said we were crazy when we
[3805.92s] were buying Alibaba in the 90s, in the
[3807.92s] 80s, in the 60s. Now it&#39;s over 145,
[3810.96s] going to over 200 over the next 12 to 24
[3813.52s] months. I&#39;m telling you, Intel is going
[3815.44s] to be the exact same way, Taylor.
[3817.359s] They&#39;re calling me crazy now. when it&#39;s
[3819.2s] at 40 50 60 they&#39;re gonna say wow you
[3822.079s] know it&#39;s is it time to buy at 60 and
[3824.079s] I&#39;m gonna say yeah it&#39;s probably going
[3825.44s] higher lip banan is a miracle worker why
[3827.839s] don&#39;t we make crazy good again sometimes
[3829.839s] my husband calls me a little crazy and
[3831.839s] look I didn&#39;t turn out so bad so maybe a
[3834.24s] little crazy isn&#39;t so bad really
[3836.4s] appreciate both of you Alan Mcnite and
[3838.4s] Thomas Hayes please come back and join
[3840.24s] me thank you Taylor mean
[3844.48s] and we&#39;re back and then I got to join uh
[3848.079s] uh two incredible, well, three
[3850.319s] incredible people on the Money Show
[3852.4s] podcast this week. I want to thank Mike
[3854.559s] Larson for having me on. As always, my
[3856.96s] buddy Kenny Pulcari and Jim Bianco, who
[3860.24s] is a bond expert uh and macroeconomic
[3864.0s] expert was great to be on with the three
[3865.76s] of them. We don&#39;t have time to go
[3867.28s] through the whole half hour, so I cut
[3868.799s] out my clips, which is a broad overview
[3870.799s] of the markets, so we can get through
[3872.92s] that. Accord is how you put it in just a
[3875.44s] minute, but I want to go to Tom first.
[3876.88s] Tom, I know your big bottoms up
[3878.559s] analysis, valuation of individual
[3880.16s] companies, but you got to look at the
[3881.359s] big picture here, too. You know, what
[3883.039s] are your thoughts on just how things
[3884.319s] have changed since the first of the year
[3885.68s] till now? Well, I think this is pretty
[3888.16s] standard, Mike. This is what we see
[3889.839s] pretty much every four years, uh,
[3892.079s] post-election year. You see some
[3893.599s] weakness in February through mid-Marchch
[3896.0s] and then you start to find a bottom. And
[3897.68s] why why is that pretty uniform going
[3899.68s] back, you know, hundred something years
[3901.599s] is because uh people want to get a sense
[3904.16s] of what the policy is. And it doesn&#39;t
[3905.839s] have to be good policy. It just needs to
[3907.839s] be known policy. And I think that&#39;s what
[3910.319s] we&#39;re grappling with uh with Trump right
[3912.799s] now. But I like I I say to many people,
[3914.88s] welcome to Trump 2.0. Same as Trump 1.0.
[3918.0s] New day, new headline, new tweet, new
[3920.48s] volatility resolves higher over time. Uh
[3924.079s] and what I like what we saw last week is
[3926.559s] uh a big flush out. You know, record
[3928.559s] selling by hedge funds. Uh that&#39;s a
[3930.88s] contrarian indicator. Uh a lot of
[3932.96s] momentum followers there. Overlever
[3935.2s] retail uh investors bought record
[3937.839s] insurance, record put buying after the
[3940.079s] house was already burned down. You want
[3941.839s] to buy those insurance premiums before
[3943.76s] the fire starts. Uh so you can&#39;t make
[3946.16s] that up. Then you had the largest drop
[3947.839s] in US equity allocation on record in the
[3950.319s] Bank of America fund manager survey. uh
[3952.96s] which we saw this week. So I I think I
[3955.44s] think we&#39;re finding a a situation where
[3957.839s] we can go in and buy stocks. Uh as for
[3960.319s] the MAG 7, you know, at your events
[3962.16s] towards the end of the year, I was
[3963.599s] saying the theme was going to be a shift
[3965.599s] out of the Mag 7 into the unmagnificent
[3968.079s] 493 and more importantly into into
[3970.599s] international. That&#39;s played out uh as
[3973.24s] anticipated. We think that theme will
[3976.559s] continue. And Mag 7, you got to look at
[3978.88s] two things. Number one, one thing no
[3980.64s] one&#39;s paying attention to that I&#39;ve seen
[3982.48s] is the Japanese carry trade unwind.
[3984.88s] Okay? And all you need to do is look at
[3987.2s] 10-year JGBs and what you see what used
[3989.599s] to be free hot money now has a cost.
[3993.119s] 10-year JGB yields are at
[3995.88s] 20ear highs. Those have continued to
[3998.48s] creep up aggressively in the last four
[4000.4s] weeks. And as a result, the most
[4002.4s] impacted part of the market has been the
[4005.039s] MAG 7 where all that hot money has been
[4007.92s] parked. So, I do think that yes, we are
[4011.28s] due for a technical bounce. Uh, maybe
[4014.16s] MAG 7 will trade back up to the top of
[4016.48s] the range, but I think the theme for
[4018.319s] 2025 will continue. MAG 7 will
[4022.119s] underperform relative to 493 and
[4025.359s] dramatically underperform relative to
[4028.559s] international as we&#39;ve seen. Y, thanks
[4031.039s] Tom. Let me a little bit. I mean, you&#39;ve
[4033.28s] talked international, you mentioned
[4034.319s] Alibaba. Is there anything else that
[4035.52s] that particularly excites you now? I
[4036.88s] know you&#39;ve talked about some names at
[4038.0s] our past events, but we&#39;re getting
[4039.039s] towards the end of Q1, so I figured I&#39;d
[4040.72s] uh I&#39;d see if there&#39;s anything new
[4041.76s] that&#39;s on your radar screen. Look, I I
[4043.52s] think uh Intel is the most underrated
[4047.359s] story. If they liquidated the whole damn
[4048.96s] thing today, you&#39;d probably get about 22
[4050.96s] 23 bucks. It&#39;s trading at 25. Lip Banan
[4054.72s] uh was at Cadence Designs, which makes
[4057.039s] the software for all of these chip
[4059.68s] designers. Lip Bhutan became CEO of
[4062.799s] Cadence Designs in January 2009 after
[4066.079s] the stock was down
[4068.2s] 86%. If you&#39;d put a million dollars with
[4071.039s] this guy, uh by the time he stepped down
[4074.0s] as executive chairman 14 years later in
[4076.72s] 2023, that $1 million became
[4080.2s] $68 million. 68 bagger. This guy is a
[4084.319s] miracle worker. Intel needs a miracle.
[4086.799s] he&#39;s going to deliver and he&#39;s not
[4089.28s] interested in partnerships or selling it
[4091.2s] off for parts. He&#39;s going to run this
[4092.72s] thing up the flag pole. And here&#39;s the
[4094.319s] thing, Nvidia is not down because of
[4096.64s] lack of demand. Nvidia is down because
[4098.96s] of lack of supply. TSMC is at capacity
[4101.92s] and only gives them $4 billion of
[4104.4s] revenue growth per quarter, which on a
[4106.88s] bigger base decelerates the revenue
[4109.12s] growth from 250% down to probably 30 40%
[4112.4s] by the end of this year. They need
[4114.319s] capacity. TSMC could say, &quot;Yes, Mr.
[4117.04s] Trump, we&#39;re going to invest a trillion
[4119.199s] dollars in the United States.&quot; The
[4120.64s] problem is it&#39;s going to take them four
[4122.0s] to five years to get to where Intel is
[4124.48s] with their fabs today. So, love
[4126.48s] Gellzinger or hate him, he did one thing
[4128.319s] over the last four years. He set Intel
[4130.159s] up for success. And Lip Bhan is going to
[4133.12s] come in and spike the football in the
[4135.12s] end zone as uh these this chip
[4137.6s] production comes on on board. Right now,
[4140.48s] Nvidia and Broadcom are testing their
[4142.719s] chip in Intel&#39;s US fabs. And from what
[4146.4s] we have gotten back through media, it&#39;s
[4148.4s] going quite well. This game is just be
[4151.44s] beginning for Intel for everyone saying,
[4152.88s] &quot;Oh, Intel&#39;s going out of business.&quot; I
[4154.719s] mean, give me a break. They&#39;ve done over
[4156.319s] $50 billion of revenue in the last 12
[4158.64s] months being completely mismanaged. And
[4160.719s] now you got someone who can who can ride
[4162.48s] this horse to the promised land, and
[4164.239s] we&#39;re getting on with them. Yeah. As an
[4166.64s] old school person, you know, all I can
[4167.839s] do is reminisce about the Winel days,
[4169.679s] right? Why we only have a couple minutes
[4171.52s] left. I want to make sure just for
[4173.04s] anybody watching, uh Jim is going to be
[4174.719s] joining us in Dallas and Miami. Uh Tom
[4177.12s] and Kenny are going to be joining us at
[4178.159s] the Miami Symposium in May. Guys, if you
[4180.239s] have maybe 30 45 seconds to just give a
[4182.08s] preview preview of what you you think
[4183.679s] you&#39;re going to be talking about. Tom,
[4184.88s] maybe I&#39;ll go to you first and uh let
[4186.48s] you do that now. Yeah. I think one of my
[4188.799s] segments is going to be how the
[4190.759s] uninvestable became investable while we
[4194.0s] were building up our Baba position. and
[4195.679s] everyone said it&#39;s uninvestable. It&#39;s
[4197.12s] uninvestable. It&#39;s uninvestable. We&#39;re
[4198.64s] going to talk about kind of market
[4200.08s] sentiment that goes into that, how you
[4202.08s] can see through the noise, look under
[4203.6s] the cover, uh follow the fundamentals.
[4205.92s] In the short term, the market is a
[4207.6s] voting machine based on emotions like
[4209.52s] you saw in the last two years in China.
[4211.6s] In the long term, it&#39;s a weighing
[4213.12s] machine based on fundamentals like
[4214.96s] you&#39;re seeing right now. Uh and then
[4216.88s] we&#39;re going to talk about some uh in the
[4218.719s] second segment, some year-end picks,
[4220.48s] year-end outlook. A lot of opportunities
[4222.32s] to make money in the second half of this
[4224.32s] year. So, we&#39;re really excited to go
[4225.679s] down to Miami and deliver a lot of
[4227.32s] value. And we&#39;re
[4230.04s] back. And uh and this is the event that
[4234.239s] Mike and I referenced in the Money Show
[4236.48s] interview. I&#39;ll be speaking at the Money
[4239.36s] Show in Miami. The event is from the
[4242.239s] 15th through the 17th. My two segments
[4244.48s] are on Saturday the 17th before I fly to
[4248.48s] go see my friends in Dubai. Uh looking
[4251.6s] forward to that. So you can register
[4253.76s] either at the money show website
[4256.679s] miamimmms.com or go to hedge funips.com
[4259.6s] and just put Miami in the search bar and
[4263.04s] this will come up and you can register
[4264.84s] there. Uh then I had a chance to join
[4268.48s] Diego on um CGTN America. Want to thank
[4273.04s] Diego and Chamellia Kilawan for having
[4275.76s] me on. This was about Tesla and Elon
[4277.76s] Musk. You can go ahead and watch that at
[4281.239s] hedgefundtips.com. And I want to thank
[4283.44s] Yahoo Naomi Buchanan for including me in
[4286.08s] her in her article on Yahoo Finance
[4288.64s] about the carry trade. And now our
[4291.36s] quotes of the week. Um the there has
[4295.12s] never been a more appropriate quote for
[4298.239s] what is happening right now. It it&#39;s
[4300.64s] kind of funny because so many people are
[4303.12s] coming up to me complaining about the
[4305.04s] stock market at the country club and
[4307.199s] everything else and and like when&#39;s this
[4309.04s] going to stop? I&#39;m like what&#39;s what
[4310.32s] going to stop? Like you know I mean
[4312.96s] we&#39;ve just had an exciting period of
[4315.76s] time between what&#39;s going on with uh
[4318.32s] Alibaba and some of the others. And you
[4320.159s] know, it&#39;s interesting as it relates to
[4321.44s] Cooper Standard and I had a number of
[4323.84s] comments, you know, uh today like the
[4326.159s] they really enjoyed the uh CEO interview
[4329.6s] and and everything else. And I said,
[4331.84s] &quot;Look, you know, $2 down or $2 up really
[4335.679s] doesn&#39;t matter. The key
[4338.6s] is how we&#39;re positioned for the
[4343.04s] long-term story.&quot; And Cooper Standard
[4345.04s] couldn&#39;t be better positioned. And
[4347.52s] nothing has changed either really in the
[4350.159s] information, although the information&#39;s
[4351.84s] gotten a little bit better than our
[4353.28s] original thesis than um than when we
[4356.719s] originally got involved in May of 2022.
[4359.199s] It&#39;s just now all the things that we
[4361.28s] said were going to happen when no one
[4363.199s] believed it are now starting to happen
[4365.12s] and people are starting to get excited.
[4366.88s] And I think it&#39;s it&#39;s literally the
[4369.28s] early days of the early days. And when
[4371.36s] this thing turns, it turns all at once
[4373.92s] just like we saw with Alibaba. It takes
[4376.96s] years then it happens all at once just
[4379.12s] like we saw with many many others
[4380.8s] throughout the years of this podcast. So
[4382.88s] this is a very important thing. Uh you
[4385.52s] know I think Buffett likes to say uh the
[4388.08s] guy enjoying the shade today planted the
[4390.48s] seeds many years ago uh um to to create
[4394.0s] that tree and and that&#39;s what we try and
[4395.92s] do. And we be we are very methodical
[4400.679s] about burdening ourselves with the
[4403.04s] facts. And then once we know what we
[4405.44s] own, not getting deterred by short-term
[4407.6s] noise, whether it&#39;s $5 up or $5 down is
[4410.96s] completely immaterial. We know the
[4413.36s] intrinsic value, the price at which we
[4416.0s] are willing to be a seller before we
[4418.08s] even enter the investment, before we
[4420.32s] even enter the position. And I can
[4422.32s] assure you uh with Cooper Standard, we
[4424.719s] are nowhere near that price. Uh uh um
[4431.4s] uh
[4433.159s] it&#39;s anyway if if you I&#39;ll be very
[4436.88s] interested to see the takeaways in the
[4438.64s] comments section and who wins it because
[4440.4s] if you listen very carefully to what
[4444.0s] this business can do both with anem with
[4447.92s] apocalyptic scenario volumes and god
[4450.32s] forbid normalized uh uh volumes.
[4453.88s] Um it&#39;s it&#39;s uh it&#39;s pretty exciting.
[4457.04s] Anyway, Charlie Munger, people calculate
[4459.679s] too much and think too little. I think
[4462.159s] that&#39;s certainly the case. I have people
[4464.4s] saying, &quot;Well, what if this happens and
[4465.92s] what if that happens?&quot; Look, I don&#39;t
[4467.44s] have a crystal ball about policy and all
[4470.239s] this stuff. It will be a short-term bump
[4472.0s] in the road. At the end of the day,
[4473.84s] there&#39;s a there&#39;s a a there&#39;s a
[4476.44s] population. There is a useful life in an
[4479.88s] automobile. And all of those things
[4482.92s] require massive amounts of automobiles.
[4485.44s] And I actually think this cycle is going
[4487.199s] to peak well above 18 just because of
[4489.6s] the size of the population relative to
[4491.52s] previous cycle peaks. number one, the
[4493.84s] age of the fleet, which is the the
[4495.92s] oldest it&#39;s ever been, and some of the
[4499.52s] initiatives that this administration are
[4501.679s] putting in place as it relates to uh
[4504.159s] lowering rates. And we&#39;re going to talk
[4505.84s] about that a little bit, what Bessant is
[4507.6s] doing, um and potentially making uh
[4512.239s] loans on interest pay payments
[4514.6s] taxdeductible, as well as incentives
[4517.76s] starting to pick up massively, and
[4520.0s] they&#39;re only going to go higher. So uh a
[4522.4s] couple charts we want to some data we
[4524.159s] want to cover this week. First and
[4525.76s] foremost average S&amp;P returns following
[4528.48s] 21 corrections of 10% since 1980. So
[4531.92s] when there has been no recession was
[4533.84s] which was 14 out of the 21 times which
[4536.159s] we believe this will be the case this
[4538.4s] time. Uh 12 months later you&#39;re up 11%
[4541.52s] on average. And then want to cover some
[4544.48s] of the Sloomer
[4547.08s] um insights here.
[4554.48s] uh you could see here. I mean, look,
[4556.239s] there&#39;s there&#39;s no question if you take
[4558.56s] a long-term view that this could pull
[4560.159s] back further. I just don&#39;t think at the
[4563.76s] moment, given the given the wash out in
[4566.48s] sentiment and positioning and everything
[4568.0s] else. Uh I think we&#39;ve actually run out
[4571.44s] of sellers in the short term, which is
[4573.12s] why couple weeks ago on Vney, I put
[4575.76s] myself on a limb. I said we&#39;d be much
[4577.28s] higher a few weeks out. I think that&#39;s
[4579.199s] going to be the case. If it&#39;s not
[4580.719s] already the case, I don&#39;t know if we&#39;re
[4582.32s] higher yet, but I think we&#39;ll be much
[4583.76s] higher by the end of the month, uh, as
[4585.84s] it relates to where we were on that
[4587.52s] segment. By the way, I&#39;ll be on Vanney
[4589.36s] tomorrow morning at 10 a.m. Eastern. So,
[4591.28s] check that out. Very excited. Thank you,
[4593.04s] Christian Dagger. Um, this is the
[4596.48s] average path of the S&amp;P you during years
[4599.84s] 1 and two of the election cycle since
[4602.199s] 1928. We&#39;ve talked about this every
[4604.56s] week, which is why we told you in the
[4606.48s] beginning of February, buckle up,
[4607.92s] buttercup, and get your shopping list
[4609.84s] ready. And that&#39;s exactly what happened.
[4613.04s] Um, here&#39;s the blue line here. So, eight
[4616.32s] weeks in, that&#39;s beginning of February.
[4618.159s] And then through the end of March, you
[4620.0s] get another checkback retest, which
[4621.92s] probably what we&#39;re going through right
[4623.12s] now, and then straight up into the
[4625.52s] summer, and then some weakness in the
[4627.44s] end of the year. So, I think that the
[4629.44s] people um you know, we talked about last
[4631.76s] week, by the way, uh we&#39;re going to be
[4634.48s] opening up for the small accounts on uh
[4637.84s] April
[4638.84s] 1st and uh that you could get in the
[4642.159s] queue and start to get your paperwork
[4644.4s] going and get your uh account approved
[4646.8s] by Interactive Brokers so that on April
[4649.44s] 1st when we&#39;re open, you can fund and we
[4651.36s] can start to allocate. Not that you kind
[4653.679s] of missed this whole thing here uh uh
[4656.719s] waiting and a lot of you have jumped on
[4658.64s] that. So excited to get you guys in. Um
[4661.92s] you can fund before the first but we&#39;ll
[4663.92s] start to put the money to work for you
[4665.44s] on April 1st. And for those of you who
[4668.08s] are thinking about coming in uh we&#39;ll be
[4670.64s] open for a few weeks and then we&#39;ll
[4672.32s] close it out for Q2 for the small
[4674.08s] accounts. uh normal size accounts of the
[4676.719s] uh by the way our minimum is 1 million
[4678.88s] and for normalsiz accounts of 5 million
[4682.159s] uh there are no cuto offs you can come
[4683.52s] in whenever you want there&#39;s bes bespoke
[4686.4s] service at that level and then after
[4689.6s] this massive amount of money can be made
[4691.679s] in the first year uh then it starts to
[4694.64s] get you know we&#39;ll be harvesting profits
[4697.12s] at at full value finding some shorts and
[4699.92s] uh getting prepared for the year two of
[4702.0s] the midcycle correction which can be a
[4703.679s] bit more bumpier here and we love those
[4705.36s] type of years as well. But, uh, this is
[4708.08s] where easy money can be made if you&#39;re
[4709.76s] positioned right. Uh, S&amp;P and NASDAQ 100
[4714.8s] again seems to be wanting to put in some
[4717.6s] bottoms here. Maybe we&#39;ll retest before
[4720.08s] we go higher, but uh, you know, you can
[4722.64s] see the equal weight. And by the way, if
[4724.88s] you&#39;re listening to this on audio,
[4726.48s] that&#39;s super. Keep listening. But if you
[4728.88s] can from time to time tune in on YouTube
[4731.76s] and watch and of course like and
[4734.56s] comment. That&#39;s what keeps this thing
[4736.0s] going. The more you like and the more
[4737.76s] you comment, the more they&#39;re going to
[4738.96s] serve it up to people when they log into
[4741.12s] YouTube, which will give us more and
[4742.88s] more people watching, which will make us
[4744.56s] want to do this more and more for uh
[4747.6s] both clients and non-clients alike. We
[4749.84s] will always do something like this for
[4751.44s] clients. Uh but for non-clients who have
[4753.92s] been on the free ride money train uh pay
[4757.84s] you know do your part and um uh like
[4761.44s] subscribe comment and uh and let&#39;s keep
[4764.4s] doing this for a long time. Uh all right
[4767.52s] Europe rocking and rolling here as we
[4770.159s] talked about international versus the US
[4772.32s] that&#39;s been a huge theme coming into the
[4774.08s] year. Uh even UK Germany started to
[4777.04s] rally on big stimulus that they
[4779.199s] announced. Hang Sang has been the, you
[4781.44s] know, Chinese equity&#39;s biggest performer
[4783.679s] from uninvestable to investable. All the
[4786.4s] folks who were downgrading when Baba was
[4788.56s] 70 are now upgrading at 140. Just the
[4791.52s] beginning, ladies and gentlemen, as we
[4793.12s] flip them all over. Japan struggling. I
[4796.719s] think that&#39;s going to persist because
[4798.32s] we&#39;ve talked about the carry trade. Uh
[4801.36s] they have to continue to raise rates
[4803.199s] after printing money for three decades
[4804.96s] as inflation kicks in. So that will be
[4807.76s] uh continued pressure on the reversing
[4810.239s] the carry trade on the MAG 7 on all the
[4812.719s] hot money stocks on all the shiny
[4814.8s] objects that uh people chase that are
[4817.28s] now getting smashed and these are the
[4818.96s] people that come up to me and say when
[4820.88s] will the pain stop? I&#39;m like what pain?
[4822.88s] We we don&#39;t own any mag 7. We sold all
[4825.04s] those in July of last year after buying
[4827.28s] them in in October and November 2022. Um
[4831.84s] so here&#39;s 10-year yield continues to
[4833.6s] roll over. I think this is going to go
[4835.04s] down to the low end of the range. This
[4837.04s] got up to 480. Complete fake out and I
[4839.84s] said we were going to see a three handle
[4841.12s] before we saw a five handle. Everyone
[4843.04s] was so convinced it was going to five.
[4845.28s] Not going to be the case. Um so we&#39;ll
[4848.48s] probably get another fake out here,
[4849.92s] maybe back up to 450 before we go lower.
[4852.48s] But um the trend is your friend. Dollar
[4855.679s] absolutely collapsing after the
[4857.6s] election. It took off, faked everyone
[4859.12s] out. We said, &quot;Guys, after the after the
[4862.8s] inauguration, watch out below.&quot; And here
[4865.12s] we go. This has a lot further to fall.
[4867.199s] That&#39;s also good for even the Looney is
[4869.679s] getting a bounce now. Uh so that&#39;s a
[4872.8s] good thing. You&#39;ve got some new
[4874.0s] leadership there. Not sure it&#39;s better
[4875.679s] than the old leadership, but uh it&#39;s new
[4878.08s] and at least someone someone that we can
[4880.0s] talk to and uh get back to a mutually
[4882.44s] beneficial uh agreement. Uh WTI crude.
[4886.88s] Look, if all else fails, Wayne Gretzky
[4888.96s] will run the 51st state and it&#39;ll be
[4890.8s] absolutely incredible. So, uh, all
[4893.44s] right, there. There we go. I just lost
[4895.04s] all my Canadian viewers. Uh, WTI crude
[4898.8s] oil, it&#39;s in this range. I think this is
[4901.12s] going to probably resolve higher and
[4902.8s] some of the oil stocks are going to go
[4904.159s] with it. Uh, we continue to like our com
[4906.8s] stock resource, which we bought much
[4908.88s] lower. Um,
[4911.719s] uh, WTI crude. So yeah, again, I just
[4915.44s] not finding anything in oil and gas that
[4917.679s] makes me super excited, but they&#39;re all
[4919.12s] going to go up marginally. And when I
[4920.88s] say marginally, they&#39;re not going to be
[4922.08s] doubles and triples other than what we
[4924.159s] have with Commtock. They&#39;re going to be,
[4926.8s] you know, 30 50% and I just won&#39;t risk
[4928.96s] capital for for anemic returns like
[4931.36s] that.
[4933.08s] Um, copper, this is uh doc Dr. Copper
[4936.56s] has a PhD in economics. That&#39;s a leading
[4938.56s] indicator for global growth, which tells
[4940.56s] you that China&#39;s coming back. uh which
[4942.719s] we know from Alibaba, our largest
[4946.6s] position, which has fortunately gone
[4949.44s] straight up this year, which is
[4950.88s] exciting. Higher highs, higher lows. Um
[4954.48s] looks like some of these semis want to
[4958.76s] bounce. PayPal. God, I love it here.
[4961.76s] Every new dollar that comes in, we&#39;re
[4964.0s] we&#39;ve been able to uh pick up some
[4966.639s] PayPal. We&#39;ll be picking up some more VF
[4969.28s] Corp. all these incredible companies
[4971.36s] that we&#39;re excited about. Um, Generrack
[4975.199s] even has come into a point where it
[4976.8s] actually add even though we bought well
[4978.4s] below 100. Uh, I&#39;d love to add more at
[4981.84s] these levels. Pretty excited about that.
[4987.159s] Uh, and what else do we have
[4990.44s] here? I think that&#39;s pretty much it. So,
[4993.04s] that&#39;s Robert Sloomer over at RBC.
[4997.76s] Always puts out some good charts. Thank
[4999.679s] you to my friends over there. Uh, how
[5002.96s] Jack Ma&#39;s pivot to AI rehabilitated
[5005.4s] Alibaba. It&#39;s a great article in the
[5007.6s] Financial Times. I don&#39;t say that very
[5009.28s] often, but as you can see here, we&#39;re
[5010.88s] just getting started and uh, they&#39;re
[5013.6s] talking about the pivot and they&#39;re
[5015.36s] talking about what&#39;s happened. Alibaba
[5017.28s] revenues have risen steadily as profits
[5020.159s] have recovered from its recent dip. So
[5022.0s] you can see here from 2021 till now even
[5025.28s] in the most difficult operating
[5026.96s] environment now that they&#39;ve got the
[5029.199s] governmental tailwinds behind them the
[5031.76s] AI tailwinds and all the other amazing
[5033.679s] things toll taker with domestic
[5035.84s] consumption
[5037.76s] uh as a focus of the government they&#39;re
[5039.679s] just going to mint money and like as I
[5041.44s] like to say print more bills than the US
[5043.639s] Treasury. Uh Alibaba&#39;s capex is going
[5047.28s] up. They&#39;ve they&#39;ve got 80 billion of
[5048.88s] cash. That&#39;s a good thing for them to do
[5050.8s] to just box out the other people and
[5052.639s] gain more and more share. China unveils
[5055.28s] plan to vigorously boost weak
[5058.04s] consumption. Vigorously boost. Uh so
[5061.44s] they&#39;re putting their money where their
[5062.639s] mouth is. Uh that is their game plan.
[5065.36s] They used to build bridges to nowhere
[5067.04s] and empty cities. Now they&#39;re going to
[5068.8s] get people to spend because they want to
[5070.719s] be like America. And Alibaba is the
[5073.84s] number one toll taker for the middle and
[5075.76s] upper class spending in China. And
[5077.679s] that&#39;s the spending that matters. Uh
[5080.239s] like everyone where else in the world,
[5082.32s] the top 10 or 20% make up the vast
[5085.6s] majority of the spending and that&#39;s
[5087.28s] where Alibaba thrives. Teimu sells
[5090.32s] garbage at the low end, which did okay
[5092.159s] for a couple years when they were in
[5093.76s] lockdown and everyone felt poor, but as
[5096.56s] things recover, uh Alibaba is going to
[5098.639s] whip their butts. China banks cut
[5101.199s] consumer loan rates to record low to
[5103.199s] spur demand. Hong Kong stocks hit
[5105.6s] three-year highs on Trump talks could
[5107.44s] ease trade trade tensions. So Trump is
[5110.56s] going to be having a meeting with Xi. Um
[5114.56s] maybe sooner than June, but it
[5116.639s] definitely looks like June. Uh Alibaba
[5119.679s] and other Chinese stocks are crushing US
[5121.679s] shares. Here&#39;s why. This is from a new
[5124.159s] author at journalist at Baron, not the
[5127.12s] one that wrote 135 consecutive negative
[5129.679s] headlines about China and Chinese
[5131.36s] stocks. have not seen her write in
[5133.84s] months now since Alibaba has been going
[5136.159s] straight up and she told everyone to get
[5138.08s] out of it. Uh but uh all the rest of the
[5141.199s] authors have been absolutely phenomenon
[5144.239s] uh Kellum included. Why is China
[5147.04s] spending billions to get people to open
[5148.8s] their wallets is a great article from
[5150.32s] the BBC getting serious about spending.
[5156.36s] Uh and Baba is the key toll taker with
[5159.28s] Tao and T-Mol. US factory production
[5161.44s] rises by the most in a year on auto
[5163.84s] output. So remember as Jeff was talking
[5166.56s] about there may be some pull forward
[5168.719s] into Q1 with everyone getting ahead of
[5171.199s] the tariffs on August 2nd. Uh new
[5174.88s] vehicle affordability approves again in
[5178.12s] February. So incentives are going up,
[5181.12s] prices are going down as they&#39;re more
[5182.8s] reasonably sized cars, hybrids which
[5185.44s] have a greater cost per vehicle. All of
[5187.44s] this is benefiting Cooper Standard.
[5191.28s] Intel is the best chip stock this year
[5195.679s] in a surprising reversal. No one is
[5198.88s] expecting overnight, but investors like
[5201.44s] Intel&#39;s CEO announcement. Um, you know,
[5204.88s] the last shall be first. I I went on
[5206.639s] Charles Payne last year when Nvidia was
[5210.12s] $153 and I said to sell Nvidia and buy
[5213.6s] Intel and after that he didn&#39;t invite me
[5216.08s] on the show for three months. Uh may
[5219.52s] maybe I&#39;ll get back on the show now
[5221.44s] because it&#39;s proved to be the correct
[5222.96s] call. Although they did call me this
[5224.56s] morning. They&#39;re like, &quot;You in New
[5225.52s] York?&quot; I&#39;m like, &quot;Yeah, I&#39;m about 2,000
[5227.199s] miles away. Can I can I be there by 2
[5229.44s] o&#39;clock?&quot; I don&#39;t think so. Uh, so
[5231.6s] hopefully I&#39;ll do some remotes with them
[5233.04s] before getting in studio next month when
[5234.88s] I&#39;m back in the city. Uh, love his show
[5237.28s] for sure. Dell CEO explains why he
[5239.76s] thinks the PC refresh cycle is starting.
[5243.199s] That&#39;s who who&#39;s the number one
[5244.719s] beneficiary of the P PC refresh uh uh is
[5249.6s] Intel
[5251.8s] um the handsdown leader in inferior
[5255.6s] chips.
[5257.679s] uh BFA survey shows biggest ever drop in
[5260.96s] US stock allocation. So all these
[5263.36s] managers selling in the hole. Why
[5265.28s] lowering the yield on the 10-year bonds
[5267.199s] is more important to Trump than the
[5269.04s] stock market or interest rates. This is
[5271.52s] the critical thing. All mortgages are
[5274.08s] tied to the
[5276.04s] 10-year Treasury yield. Uh so if he
[5279.92s] brings that down, number one, he can
[5281.679s] refinance the US debt at a lower rate.
[5283.84s] Number two, he can spur house buying,
[5286.56s] auto buying, everything. Get the game
[5289.12s] going, get nominal growth cranking so
[5291.199s] that debt as a percentage of GDP goes
[5293.52s] down. Uh even if the actual debt in
[5296.639s] dollars does not uh and uh Bessant was
[5300.639s] out talking a little bit about that this
[5302.56s] week, uh about a way that they&#39;re going
[5306.159s] to lower the 10-year yield by another 30
[5308.8s] basis points, and it has to do with the
[5310.719s] supplementary leverage ratio at banks.
[5313.44s] If that is removed, uh, it&#39;ll
[5316.08s] automatically drop 30 basis points to
[5318.0s] the 10-year yield. Each basis point is
[5320.639s] worth a billion dollars a year in
[5322.239s] interest payments. So, uh, that is a
[5324.48s] good thing, not a bad thing. And they
[5326.4s] are all over that. So, when I talked
[5328.32s] about a three handle before a five
[5329.92s] handle, I wasn&#39;t joking. And now we&#39;ve
[5332.08s] got an administration that is deadly
[5334.08s] focused on it. Confidence in German
[5336.0s] economy surges as parliament approves
[5338.88s] huge spending plan.
[5341.44s] Boeing sees cash flow improve as jet
[5343.76s] factories stabilized. That had a nice
[5345.679s] move this week. Crown Castle finally
[5348.0s] completed the sale of the fiber
[5349.76s] business. The stock shot up. Uh that was
[5352.639s] great. Building products. This is huge
[5354.8s] news this week with uh Brad Jacobs over
[5357.679s] at QXO. He finally clinched a deal for
[5360.159s] Beacon Roofing. So he now has his
[5363.12s] platform company and this is where he
[5365.84s] will be able to work his magic as he has
[5368.239s] so many times in the past. Whether it
[5370.719s] was Waste Connections selling to Waste
[5372.8s] Management, Multibagger uh in the late
[5375.36s] 80s or early 90s, whether it was United
[5377.84s] Rentals when he got involved in
[5379.96s] 1997, if you&#39;d put up a million dollars
[5382.48s] with him, it it&#39;s now worth $74 million.
[5386.159s] 74 Bagger. And uh XPO Logistics, if he
[5390.48s] if you had invested side by side with
[5392.4s] him, he came in 2011, he invested $150
[5395.84s] million of his own money. uh and it was
[5399.04s] a 160 bagger that if you had uh invested
[5403.52s] $1 million you&#39;d have 160 million and uh
[5407.199s] right now QXO he didn&#39;t invest 151 150
[5411.84s] of his own money he&#39;s got so much
[5413.76s] conviction in this business plan he&#39;s
[5415.28s] put over a billion dollars of his own
[5416.96s] cash uh which is
[5419.239s] material and um and we&#39;re invested
[5422.8s] alongside of him so kudos to all of my
[5426.4s] investors who are now able to uh
[5430.0s] participate in that and um and the game
[5432.96s] is just beginning. So, we&#39;ll look for
[5435.28s] any opportunities to add more and take
[5438.32s] advantage because this is one that you
[5440.92s] just buy, close your eyes, and in 5
[5444.0s] years you have a multibagger. I think
[5446.0s] this thing&#39;s going to be probably the
[5448.48s] calculations I did when we got involved
[5451.44s] uh sometime back at
[5454.199s] around I don&#39;t know when let&#39;s see when
[5457.28s] was
[5458.12s] it I think our base is around
[5461.159s] $11. I can&#39;t find the mouse for the
[5463.44s] other computer. I think it was 1176 but
[5465.52s] I&#39;m cuffing that. But
[5470.36s] um I think the calculation I have
[5472.8s] internally is like an 8 to10 bagger over
[5475.04s] a
[5476.44s] decade. So I think I was looking at like
[5479.199s] an 80 to $100 stock. So um we&#39;ll see as
[5483.28s] the facts change we could change our
[5484.639s] mind. Usually with Brad the facts get
[5486.56s] better as time goes on. So it could be a
[5488.32s] lot better. So but that&#39;s one you just
[5490.08s] sit there and let him work his magic. No
[5491.679s] one has created more wealth for
[5493.8s] shareholders than Brad Jacobs repeatedly
[5497.36s] over time. Certainly Buffett has created
[5499.84s] fortunes for people, but that was a
[5501.44s] one-trick pony. Uh, and a great pony,
[5504.4s] don&#39;t get me wrong, probably the best
[5505.679s] pony in the world. But, uh, Brad keeps
[5508.32s] doing it over and over, and I love the
[5509.92s] timing, and I love the play, and I love
[5511.84s] the fragmentation, and I see what he
[5514.159s] sees. And then he has this magic touch
[5515.92s] where he not only does good economic
[5518.639s] accretive uh acquisitions, but uh he
[5522.639s] finds a way to put in innovative
[5525.04s] technologies to really juice the margins
[5527.679s] and really get efficiency out of and uh
[5530.56s] uniformity out of all the acquisitions
[5532.48s] and that just drops huge amounts of cash
[5535.28s] to the owners. And uh and that&#39;s all he
[5538.08s] wakes up thinking about every single
[5539.36s] day. If you&#39;ve read his books and you&#39;ve
[5541.44s] listened to him and you&#39;ve seen what
[5542.639s] he&#39;s done for shareholders over the
[5544.08s] years, we&#39;re super excited about that
[5546.639s] and um and glad he finally got that
[5549.12s] done. Uh and that&#39;s what happens.
[5551.12s] Winners win and Brad Jacobs is a winner.
[5553.44s] So, uh US natural gas prices up on
[5556.08s] record flows to LG export plants. Cooler
[5558.32s] weather forecast. So, that helps our
[5560.48s] comm
[5561.88s] stock data center buildout stokes fears
[5564.56s] of overburdening the US grid. again
[5567.6s] comtock but more importantly gener is
[5570.88s] going to be the b beneficiary 75% of
[5573.44s] home standby generators lots of
[5575.36s] penetration to go lots of opportunity
[5577.679s] they own the space the lielo and stitch
[5580.0s] trailer has given Disney another
[5582.12s] bragworthy milestone so that&#39;s another
[5584.88s] hit for them uh we covered that okay
[5589.28s] here&#39;s the article of the week
[5593.04s] um you can find it also at their if you
[5596.32s] want to know more about Cooper Standard.
[5597.76s] You can uh watch it. You can go to their
[5602.0s] website, the investor relations, Cooper
[5603.84s] Standard investor relations site, and
[5606.56s] watch it there or look at all their
[5608.719s] other decks and
[5610.04s] presentations. Um, again, all opinion,
[5612.8s] not
[5613.639s] advice. This just gives the background
[5615.92s] of the thesis when we came out with it
[5617.92s] publicly in 2022.
[5621.36s] uh what we were saying then and some of
[5623.04s] our past articles about it which you can
[5624.96s] find all at hedge
[5627.159s] funfundtips.com and then the Bank of
[5629.52s] America fund manager survey came out
[5631.44s] this week and we put out the summary
[5634.639s] here are the top five points largest
[5637.36s] pullback in sentiment since March of
[5639.84s] 2020 the bottom of the COVID lows people
[5642.0s] are more pessimistic than then uh which
[5644.48s] was unbelievable buying opportunity
[5646.48s] number two record rotation out of US
[5648.56s] stocks falling to a net 23% underweight.
[5651.36s] The lowest allocation since June of 2023
[5654.719s] was on no one&#39;s bingo card coming into
[5656.88s] the new year. I remember speaking at one
[5659.04s] of these conferences and talking with
[5660.639s] some big names that you know very well.
[5662.4s] They were kind of laughing at me.
[5664.239s] They&#39;re like, &quot;Oh, you&#39;re just
[5665.04s] contrarian to be contrarian. You know,
[5667.199s] what&#39;s to say international is going to
[5668.88s] work?&quot; Blah, blah, blah. And these guys
[5670.96s] were the ones that were most overweight
[5673.28s] mag 7 and pounding the table at the top
[5675.28s] with all the shiny objects and um and
[5678.0s] that&#39;s the way it goes. Record rotation
[5680.08s] out of US stocks. We got that. Uh
[5683.36s] opinion follows trend as most managers
[5685.36s] are most bullish on China versus US
[5687.679s] growth since May of 2023. Just
[5690.32s] beginning. Dividend stocks continue to
[5692.08s] get bid. Remember last year we were just
[5694.48s] every single week buy uh with the
[5697.84s] largest monthly rotation on record into
[5700.159s] high versus low dividend yield. FMS cash
[5703.6s] levels went from a 15-year low last
[5705.92s] month to their largest one-month jump
[5707.76s] since 2021 December. Uh, hat tip to my
[5713.719s] buddy PV. Uh, leave him anonymous. Uh,
[5718.32s] China rolled out an action plan for
[5719.84s] boosting consumption, which might be the
[5721.36s] Chinese equivalent of quote doing
[5723.84s] whatever it takes. If you remember
[5725.76s] during the European debt crisis in 2011,
[5728.88s] Draghy came out and said we&#39;ll do
[5730.56s] whatever it takes and squeezed all of
[5732.639s] the shorts and completely destroyed the
[5734.8s] bond vigilantes. That&#39;s exactly what
[5738.08s] China is doing now that you are going to
[5740.639s] see opinion follow trend like nobody&#39;s
[5742.719s] business in the next 12 to 18 months. So
[5745.04s] much money is going to flow into their
[5746.4s] equities. It&#39;s going to your head is
[5748.32s] going to be spinning.
[5756.28s] Um they&#39;re they they basically want to
[5758.96s] get tap into that 20 trillion plus of
[5761.36s] household savings which is on the side
[5763.36s] sidelines which would put quite a few
[5765.04s] dollars in the hands of Alibaba. There
[5766.96s] is a statistic out of there where 40% of
[5770.48s] Chinese consumption goes through Alibaba
[5773.12s] which is unbelievable. I have to verify
[5775.04s] that. It&#39;s why I took it out of the
[5776.56s] article, but uh it doesn&#39;t surprise me
[5779.6s] at all. They&#39;re the leader in e-commerce
[5781.52s] and the percentage of commerce that goes
[5784.639s] through E is at the highest uh in China
[5787.36s] out of any other developed country. Uh
[5789.76s] Crown Castle update, they sold that off,
[5791.679s] which is huge. They&#39;re now going to use
[5793.28s] that cash to buy back. You can see cash
[5795.679s] flow has been great. Stock has been
[5797.6s] down. Why? Because they had a low return
[5799.44s] on investor capital on the fiber
[5801.84s] business was a drag. losing money and
[5804.639s] now they got rid of it and they got $8.5
[5806.88s] billion to boot. So, expect them to
[5809.679s] bring in the share account to invest in
[5811.679s] more uh capex light towers like their
[5814.719s] 40,000 leg legacy which are cash
[5816.96s] machines and the stock goes up. So,
[5819.199s] those of you who listened and locked in
[5820.639s] the seven or eight% dividend yield now
[5822.96s] are going to see uh from those levels
[5825.36s] probably doubles over the next few years
[5827.199s] on top of collecting 7% a year, which is
[5830.56s] uh great. Okay. And
[5833.6s] uh moving along, we&#39;ve got
[5837.88s] uh oh yeah, I want to cover ASOS real
[5841.04s] quick. You can read all that stuff on
[5842.719s] your
[5847.56s] own. Okay, so ASOS, while this has been
[5850.719s] a tiny position for us, we&#39;ve
[5852.08s] consistently been on alert for new
[5853.52s] information that would warrant making it
[5855.04s] at least a half-sized position or even a
[5857.199s] full-size position. We have yet to be
[5859.6s] impressed. Our instincts about whether a
[5861.6s] quote consultant could make a good CEO
[5864.4s] have thus far been proven correct. A lot
[5867.04s] of talk and not enough action. We hope
[5869.199s] we are proven wrong and will upsize if
[5871.36s] he starts to deliver. We do believe this
[5873.28s] is an incredible business that has huge
[5875.52s] upside potential. We don&#39;t know if they
[5877.44s] have the right leader in place or not.
[5879.44s] Uh you know, free cash flow is certainly
[5881.36s] starting to improve. That&#39;s a positive
[5883.04s] thing. He hasn&#39;t turned revenues yet. He
[5885.119s] has a strategy for that. We shall see
[5888.32s] it. you know, I&#39;d really rather have a
[5889.92s] guy like Bracken who has experience with
[5891.92s] brands, uh, a lot of expertise in doing
[5894.8s] that. But, uh, this one, you know, takes
[5898.239s] a little time. I think they&#39;re in a
[5899.52s] decent enough position. They&#39;ve got a
[5900.88s] decent enough runway. It&#39;ll be good.
[5903.04s] And, uh, at any week we could be getting
[5905.119s] on and saying, &quot;Okay, I see the light at
[5906.88s] the end of the tunnel. Let&#39;s make it a
[5908.239s] real position.&quot; But, we&#39;re just simply
[5910.56s] not there yet. Uh, I&#39;m very skeptical
[5912.96s] about this. I I have been, but we very
[5916.719s] rarely ever do a mini position. It&#39;s
[5919.28s] either going to be a full position or
[5920.639s] it&#39;s going to be nothing. But this one
[5922.639s] had all the makings of a perfect
[5924.56s] turnaround situation. I still think it
[5926.32s] does. I hope this guy can execute on it.
[5929.199s] If he can&#39;t, I think there&#39;s plenty of
[5930.96s] runway they could get someone else in
[5932.239s] there that who who can. Uh but there&#39;s
[5935.199s] no reason yet to make it a real
[5936.76s] position. And uh we&#39;ll leave it at that.
[5942.04s] Um, okay. Congratulations to all the new
[5945.28s] clients that came in through our during
[5946.88s] our 2024 and Q1 2025 raises. You could
[5950.0s] not be better positioned for what we
[5951.44s] believe will continue to be a highly
[5953.199s] rewarding year in 2025. Not many people
[5956.0s] can say that this year, which is
[5957.199s] surprise, which is surprising to us
[5959.28s] because it was pretty clear what you had
[5960.88s] to do coming into 2025, which we told
[5963.84s] every single week. Lighten up on Mag 7.
[5966.08s] I mean, we we sounded like a broken
[5967.6s] record.
[5969.239s] Um producers would be like again the
[5971.679s] same message international. Yeah, again
[5974.0s] the same message.
[5976.84s] Um this view is based on what has
[5979.28s] already taken place in 2025 as well as
[5981.04s] the data we&#39;ve shared in recent weeks on
[5982.48s] our podcast videocast coupled with our
[5984.159s] proprietary methods of expressing and
[5986.239s] executing upon those ideas on your
[5988.0s] behalf. The waitings, the derivative
[5989.84s] overlays. I mean, the secret what goes
[5992.56s] beyond what goes on on behalf of the
[5996.08s] clients is stuff that uh you can&#39;t
[5999.44s] reverse engineer from listening to the
[6000.96s] podcast. But if all you did is buy the
[6002.56s] names, uh you know, you&#39;re doing great
[6005.199s] and we&#39;re very very appreciative of uh
[6008.8s] um the names that we&#39;ve made public. Uh
[6011.84s] you guys doing a great job and uh and
[6014.0s] all the kind notes that we&#39;ve been
[6015.679s] getting.
[6017.4s] Um so we will reopen on April 1st. We
[6021.04s] are taking having the conversations
[6023.28s] getting people&#39;s paperwork processed
[6024.88s] before that and we&#39;ll deploy uh starting
[6027.76s] uh April 1st. You can go to the website
[6030.56s] at hedge funfundtips.com click on money
[6032.639s] management or just the article the week
[6035.119s] click there and uh we&#39;ll be in touch. Uh
[6038.88s] consumer discretionary top 30 weights
[6040.88s] earnings are actually down 1.8%
[6043.8s] 8% in the last 60 days and for next year
[6048.0s] down 93 basis points. So again, we&#39;re
[6050.88s] still in sandbagger season where they
[6052.639s] take estimates down the first quarter
[6054.4s] and then they beat all year and take
[6055.92s] them up. 2026 estimates have not come
[6058.719s] down surprisingly. So it&#39;s all backend
[6061.04s] loaded as it is every year. Same thing
[6063.28s] with Staples. Same exact story. That
[6065.44s] just creates opportunity for people like
[6067.28s] us.
[6069.119s] um and you and uh let&#39;s see if there&#39;s
[6072.88s] any major stuff that we wanted to cover
[6075.639s] here as it relates to economic
[6079.88s] data. Uh nothing that stands out this
[6082.88s] week. Earnings came down from 275 to
[6085.28s] 271. That&#39;s held static. And with that
[6087.6s] said, the podcast is over. We&#39;re going
[6089.119s] to stick around for a lot of AMA
[6090.8s] questions for those of you who find
[6092.239s] value in that. Let&#39;s get started. The
[6094.8s] rest of you will see you next week. Uh,
[6096.96s] Griffin Brown asks, &quot;As a recent college
[6098.96s] grad grad, what do you recommend? I look
[6101.44s] at read on a daily basis to stay update
[6103.36s] to date. Uh, don&#39;t have money for tons
[6106.239s] of subscriptions. Still feel like I&#39;m
[6107.76s] out of the loop.&quot; Uh, blah blah blah.
[6110.4s] Very fortunate family friend. Okay, so
[6113.679s] uh, Griffin number one, I mean the first
[6116.88s] of all the basics. Wall Street Journal,
[6118.32s] Bloomberg, CNBC, Barrens, for sure.
[6121.52s] Barren is the best financial publication
[6123.36s] out there.
[6127.88s] Um, and the most important thing you
[6130.08s] want to be reading, the best thing I
[6131.679s] would suggest to you is,
[6134.52s] um, first off, read the book, The
[6136.88s] Intelligent Investor by Ben Graham. Uh,
[6139.84s] second thing is you want to be
[6142.44s] reading annual reports. You should you
[6145.52s] should
[6150.28s] read one annual
[6153.08s] report per day or per week. I mean 50 in
[6156.719s] a year is pretty good. Get to know maybe
[6158.96s] the top 50 weights maybe the top maybe
[6162.48s] just a Dow 30 if you read the annual
[6164.639s] reports of all those that would pre be
[6166.48s] pretty valuable in a half a year and
[6168.96s] then start to work your way down as you
[6170.639s] find companies you&#39;re interested in.
[6172.4s] Just start to learn businesses. Um you
[6174.719s] could read the value line sheets to
[6176.32s] learn you know maybe five businesses a
[6178.4s] day in a cursory way. So then you can
[6180.4s] say oh out of these five businesses I
[6182.48s] really like uh you know whatever it
[6185.92s] happens to be and then you pull their
[6187.52s] annual report and that&#39;s one of your 50.
[6189.84s] Uh that&#39;s the most important thing as
[6191.28s] far as the noise in the headlines. You
[6192.719s] got to know what&#39;s going on. But um the
[6195.6s] way you&#39;re going to make money if you&#39;re
[6197.04s] trying to do uh get into the business is
[6199.6s] to learn companies and uh and be ready
[6202.48s] to act when their price gets dislocated.
[6204.96s] And that&#39;s what we do here. So Lee
[6208.44s] Foster, how do you go about waiting your
[6210.639s] portfolio? Do you have a scoring system?
[6213.04s] Struggle with balance allocation. Yeah,
[6214.96s] that&#39;s kind of special sauce for my
[6216.4s] clients, but um the higher conviction,
[6220.08s] the bigger the weight uh is is part of
[6222.8s] it. But um we also recognize
[6228.28s] that we have a repeatable framework.
[6231.84s] What we can control is how we analyze
[6235.36s] the financials. What we can&#39;t control is
[6238.48s] the timing in which price
[6242.36s] confirms
[6244.28s] the underlying strength of the business
[6247.04s] or the intrinsic value of the business.
[6248.88s] So that&#39;s why we&#39;ll have 8 to 12
[6250.84s] companies because some are going to get
[6253.679s] to intrinsic value and beyond much
[6256.08s] faster than we ever anticipated in less
[6258.639s] than a year. Uh and some take longer
[6261.6s] than we anticipated, you know, 3 to 5
[6264.08s] year range. Uh and they balance out by
[6266.48s] doing that. So um so it&#39;s a combination
[6270.08s] and then there&#39;s like 20 years of
[6271.679s] experience that goes into it. Like why
[6273.28s] would I have the instinct when ASOS is
[6275.679s] fundamentals for instance?
[6279.4s] um passed through my screen. It was a
[6282.239s] little bit hairy, but why would I have
[6284.08s] the instinct to make it such a small
[6286.199s] position is because I I was very
[6288.639s] uncomfortable with the CEO and watching
[6291.36s] him
[6292.84s] talk. He&#39;s fine. He
[6295.639s] believes he believes in what he&#39;s doing.
[6298.159s] I mean, he&#39;s not trying to pull one
[6299.52s] over, but I I I&#39;ve just met these like
[6305.4s] uh these consultant
[6308.6s] types, he he&#39;s
[6310.92s] probably done his part for what he can
[6313.6s] do in terms of the easy stuff, but the
[6316.8s] next phase is probably going to require
[6318.4s] someone else. Um for us to size into it
[6321.679s] is is my guess. Um, but that that just
[6325.04s] comes from experience and seeing the
[6326.719s] types of CEOs that are full of and
[6328.719s] seeing the type of CEOs that actually
[6330.4s] get stuff done. Brad Jacobs is the exact
[6332.96s] opposite end of the of the
[6336.119s] spectrum. Little talk, lots of action,
[6339.119s] huge focuses on what&#39;s ma matters. He
[6342.56s] creates shareholder value and the rest
[6344.239s] takes care of itself. Delights his
[6346.32s] customers uh versus uh try to sound cute
[6349.6s] at investor day meetings. So um uh that
[6353.52s] that&#39;s what I would say about that. It&#39;s
[6356.36s] experience. Uh many thanks for the great
[6359.36s] work. Also great work on the interview.
[6361.76s] What do you think about
[6366.76s] forvia? Aren&#39;t the fundamentals better
[6369.119s] than Cooper Standard? All right, let&#39;s
[6370.88s] see. So these are all the people who
[6372.719s] missed Cooper Standard and didn&#39;t want
[6374.88s] to get in with us when it was at five
[6376.719s] bucks. So now they&#39;re trying to find
[6378.8s] things that are quote unquote better to
[6381.36s] catch up. So,
[6384.6s] uh, number one, this is a French
[6386.8s] company, I guess, which is probably an
[6390.08s] immediate no for
[6391.8s] me.
[6393.48s] Um,
[6396.52s] FR, unless it&#39;s
[6398.84s] LVMH, VI
[6402.199s] A. I can&#39;t find
[6405.639s] this.
[6407.96s] Uh gross margin. Let&#39;s just see
[6413.8s] here. Here we
[6415.96s] go. Description.
[6418.8s] sells techn automotive technology
[6423.4s] solutions, seating, clean mobility,
[6426.56s] electronics,
[6430.679s] lighting, vehicle
[6434.52s] seats, exhaust systems for fuel cell
[6437.84s] ccentric vehicles. No one gives a
[6439.76s] about fuel cell ccentric
[6441.4s] vehicles.
[6445.0s] Um, display technologies
[6448.639s] All right, let&#39;s take a look at the
[6449.92s] financials. It seems like
[6451.719s] it&#39;s generally
[6463.0s] okay. All right. Financial analysis
[6466.4s] return on invested capital.
[6478.88s] free cash
[6482.36s] flow. Let&#39;s take a look at the balance
[6490.679s] sheet. $10 billion of debt, five billion
[6493.6s] of cash.
[6495.52s] income
[6506.119s] statement. Why is there so much dilution
[6512.84s] here? I I hate this. They&#39;ve almost
[6516.159s] doubled their share. I mean,
[6518.44s] not their share counts up 70%. If the
[6521.679s] financials were good, I I don&#39;t like
[6523.28s] this. This this is, by the way, this is
[6524.88s] what angers me about the ASOS CEO. He
[6528.56s] deluded shareholders by about 20%
[6531.44s] because he couldn&#39;t think creatively and
[6533.28s] get the job done. So, I I hate CEOs that
[6535.76s] do this kind of stuff. So, for me, the
[6537.6s] fundamentals are great. This is
[6539.44s] So,
[6541.8s] uh, not for me. And I emphasized
[6546.36s] that on the call with Jeff and
[6550.239s] acknowledged him because if anyone
[6552.56s] should have diluted the shareholders or
[6554.08s] or almost had to during the crisis in
[6556.88s] COVID, it was him and he did not do it.
[6559.84s] Why? Because he&#39;s a partner. He owns
[6561.8s] 350,000 shares, 2% of the company. That
[6564.96s] is material. And that&#39;s why they
[6567.56s] don&#39;t screw us because they would be
[6570.08s] screwing themselves. My guess is if you
[6572.239s] look at management ownership here, uh
[6574.639s] either part of the delusion is them
[6576.239s] giving themselves all these shares.
[6577.6s] Forget it. This is a French scam. Not
[6580.159s] interested. I don&#39;t care how good the
[6581.84s] fundamentals look. When you screw the
[6583.199s] shareholders like this, go to hell.
[6585.92s] Next. Micah Kelsey, your podcast is
[6589.6s] incredible. I listen to every uh video
[6592.48s] cast right when it drops on Thursday
[6594.08s] nights. Well, thank you very much.
[6596.159s] Appreciate that.
[6597.639s] Micah. Uh, the interview with CPS was
[6604.76s] excellent. Okay, so he&#39;s asking why
[6607.44s] doesn&#39;t he own more stock? I mean, the
[6610.08s] guy personally owns 350,000 shares. We
[6612.639s] own a lot lot lot more than that, but
[6616.719s] um, you know, he&#39;s one guy. I mean,
[6618.8s] he&#39;ll he&#39;s going to make I mean, if he
[6622.56s] does this right, the guy&#39;s going to make
[6631.48s] personally. I mean, he could make
[6636.84s] uh 35 to $70 million if he does it
[6641.0s] right. So, uh I don&#39;t think that&#39;s a
[6643.52s] small amount for, you know, if you look
[6645.6s] at his salary. I mean, he&#39;s not running
[6647.199s] Coca-Cola here. I mean, running a small
[6649.28s] cap company to be able to go off into
[6651.84s] the sunset with 70 million bucks is uh
[6654.88s] is nothing to shake a stick at. So, Rue
[6658.92s] Reynolds, awesome interview with Jeff
[6660.96s] Edwards. Thank you
[6662.76s] for and posting online. Yeah. Well, they
[6665.6s] they they posted it first and then we
[6667.679s] posted it after uh based on some of the
[6672.119s] insights. Oh, based on some of the
[6674.08s] insights that weren&#39;t in your base case.
[6675.92s] Look, these were known to us, but we
[6677.92s] always shave off the whipped cream. The
[6679.6s] whipped cream is just going to be extra
[6681.04s] whipped cream for us about the cost per
[6682.88s] vehicle, China mixhift, hybrids, etc.
[6687.4s] Um, but if you listen carefully, which
[6690.239s] is why I&#39;m so interested to see who wins
[6692.96s] this contest with their takeaways from
[6694.8s] the interview,
[6697.0s] because you know there there&#39;s nothing
[6701.52s] if you if you did your
[6704.84s] work, there&#39;s nothing new. It&#39;s just he
[6708.88s] did a really good job of explaining what
[6710.719s] we&#39;ve been talking about here for three
[6712.239s] years because we did our work. So, um,
[6715.199s] and it&#39;s nice to hear it from the CEO
[6717.36s] versus just
[6718.84s] some guy who does his work. You know, if
[6722.239s] you&#39;re going to allocate a lot of money
[6723.36s] to something, you better know it inside
[6724.639s] out and upside down.
[6727.48s] Um, D. So yeah, you know, see what add
[6731.76s] up the two numbers that I gave on the on
[6733.84s] the call and then add a little bit more
[6737.04s] based on some of the things that you
[6738.88s] think are new information that we&#39;ve
[6740.48s] known, you know, that we
[6742.52s] basically were aware of the trends from
[6744.8s] listening to the quarterly conference
[6746.239s] calls, but we don&#39;t factor it in because
[6748.08s] that&#39;s upside like like the sneakers,
[6750.0s] React X. Okay, that&#39;s probably going to
[6751.84s] make some good money, but it&#39;s like we
[6754.08s] have zero attributed to it. So, uh, the
[6756.56s] AI stuff, the consulting that they&#39;re
[6758.32s] doing, all that stuff, they&#39;re going to
[6759.52s] make money on it. It&#39;s, we have it as a
[6761.52s] zero. We had China as a zero. So, now
[6763.52s] it&#39;s going to be more than that. That&#39;s
[6764.639s] great. We had Europe as a zero. It&#39;s
[6766.159s] going to be more than that. So, uh,
[6768.679s] fantastic. Uh but even we we if you
[6772.639s] cover underwrite the downside the upside
[6774.8s] what what I think is amazing from that
[6776.8s] interview is just the fact is if the
[6778.639s] volumes stayed where they are the amount
[6781.119s] of money that they can make 2 3 years
[6783.28s] out blew my mind. And god forbid we go
[6787.52s] up to 1718 with 40% more population. I
[6791.52s] think we could do 1820 if if if
[6793.52s] everything clicks all at once. It takes
[6795.36s] years and then it happens all at once.
[6796.8s] Ladies and gentlemen, Jared Bentley,
[6798.639s] first of all, love your podcast. Really
[6800.0s] appreciate all the hard work you put
[6801.119s] into it. Your insights are incredible. I
[6802.8s] recently tried blah blah
[6807.719s] blah. Okay. Uh, that&#39;s a Okay, cool. Uh,
[6812.48s] Don L, what&#39;s your thoughts on leases
[6815.28s] being treated as debt? Don, who cares?
[6817.44s] It&#39;s like old news. It&#39;s a year and a
[6819.199s] half old. There&#39;s nothing we can do
[6820.32s] about it. We focus on things we can
[6821.679s] control, not things we can&#39;t control.
[6823.28s] Should it be treated as debt? I can see
[6825.52s] the argument for that. I personally
[6827.199s] don&#39;t think it needs to be, but it is.
[6830.119s] So, on to the next uh JT investor. Tom,
[6833.92s] amazing job getting Jeff everywhere on
[6835.52s] the podcast.
[6836.88s] [Music]
[6847.08s] Got Yeah, I they&#39;ll be fine. JT, thanks
[6850.88s] for the advice. Theo Djardin, uh, thanks
[6854.48s] for all the education you&#39;re providing.
[6856.08s] I&#39;m sure you made people,
[6859.04s] uh, I&#39;m sure you made people looking at
[6861.199s] the business and not just stocks, which
[6862.8s] are things that go up and down. The
[6864.639s] Buffett of our age, that&#39;s very kind. I
[6866.96s] I&#39;m there is no other Buffett, period.
[6869.04s] And my name is Tom Hayes. I appreciate
[6871.52s] the compliment, but no one can be
[6873.36s] compared to Buffett. And if you&#39;ve
[6875.92s] noticed our framework while it the core
[6878.32s] principles are the same that Buffett
[6880.639s] took from Graham um we have our own
[6883.44s] flavor of how we like to do things as
[6885.36s] well. Uh my question relates
[6887.639s] to when you see the margin of safety is
[6891.08s] sufficient after recent draw down. What
[6893.28s] do you think about Cloudflare?
[6895.96s] Um, I think Cloudflare is going to be
[6898.32s] like black line and I&#39;m going to, you
[6901.28s] know, like Buffett, it&#39;s like you really
[6904.88s] have to
[6908.28s] be, you
[6915.8s] know, you got to be damn certain that
[6918.639s] you have a defensible mode. So, look,
[6920.4s] this thing is
[6921.88s] up 12x and now it&#39;s pulled back 5 cents
[6926.239s] and you think it&#39;s a bargain. Um, you
[6929.28s] know, it&#39;s funny. One of the questions
[6930.719s] we have
[6932.04s] here, I actually want to address
[6935.4s] it. Uh, so by the way, I don&#39;t even have
[6938.159s] to look at Cloudflare. It&#39;s a no for me.
[6939.84s] But
[6941.239s] um Oh yeah. So this lady Shannon Sha
[6944.639s] Sabin asks uh hindsight being 2020 no
[6948.639s] doubt many of us should have followed
[6950.0s] your opinion not advice sooner but a
[6952.159s] question for you looking back now that
[6954.48s] you know what you know.
[6961.4s] Um anything else you would have done or
[6964.0s] thought about differently if you could
[6964.96s] do it all over again? Well, as it
[6966.56s] relates to Baba, I mean, you know, the
[6969.76s] bad news is I would have bought the bad
[6972.0s] news is I would have preferred to buy my
[6974.159s] first share a lot lower. Uh, the good
[6976.639s] news is the work that I did was so
[6980.679s] comprehensive that I was able to buy
[6983.599s] down every time that it took longer than
[6986.48s] we wanted for it to go and bring our
[6988.4s] basis across all accounts to $83. So, if
[6992.0s] it hadn&#39;t taken so long, I wouldn&#39;t have
[6995.04s] half the position or even a quarter of
[6997.28s] the position that we have today. So,
[6998.88s] it&#39;s been the best thing that ever
[7000.159s] happened to us. Now, that said, what
[7003.119s] would I do differently is um and you
[7005.76s] probably noticed it in the last year is
[7008.599s] broken momentum stocks I stay away from.
[7011.92s] So, um they really have to put in a base
[7015.76s] for a while. Like you know if you look
[7018.08s] at uh PayPal for instance you know this
[7021.04s] was another broken momentum stock and
[7024.159s] you know we were kind of waiting down
[7026.4s] here until it had bottomed for a year
[7028.96s] year and a half before we got aggressive
[7030.719s] about it uh in the low 60s and and high
[7033.84s] 50s. So, uh, I would say that we&#39;re
[7038.0s] quicker
[7039.239s] to recognize when a growth stock is
[7043.599s] broken and wait to be looking after a
[7047.119s] couple of years in here versus at the
[7049.76s] first selloff uh, in here and then
[7052.4s] having to average down before you get
[7054.239s] the recovery back. So, um, and this is a
[7057.199s] kind of a perfect example of with
[7059.8s] Cloudflare is,
[7063.48s] um, you know, and a lot of people send
[7066.08s] us stocks that are up like 20x and they
[7068.239s] just pulled back, you know, 30 or 40%
[7070.32s] and they&#39;re like, they want to jump in
[7072.28s] because they&#39;re stuck in recency bias of
[7076.8s] uh, the success. But these things, you
[7079.4s] know, when they crack, they they tend to
[7083.44s] take a because they hurt. so many
[7085.199s] institutional shareholders, it takes an
[7087.119s] awful long time to rebuild that
[7088.8s] institutional base, which is why a lot
[7090.56s] of these uh take a couple of years to
[7093.36s] build bases and you know, get a new CEO,
[7096.96s] get a new plan, and then after they&#39;ve
[7099.76s] done that, then you get the first move,
[7102.159s] then you get the pullback, and then it
[7103.76s] starts to go. Same thing with
[7106.28s] Baba. And Baba had a couple fake outs
[7108.719s] because of government stuff that you
[7109.84s] can&#39;t control. So, this was a fake out
[7112.719s] here. Um, and then it took another year.
[7116.159s] We bought a ton ton more stock and then
[7118.88s] you got the move here, fake out, and now
[7120.88s] now it just wants to go. And we saw
[7122.32s] something similar in 2017. You can look
[7125.44s] back, you got that fake out, and then
[7126.88s] once it goes, it&#39;s straight up. Daytoday
[7129.119s] you&#39;ll see up $5, down $10, but it&#39;s
[7131.36s] lower highs, uh, higher higher highs and
[7134.32s] higher lows all the way up to the
[7136.08s] promised land. And I think this time
[7137.52s] will be no different. So I would say the
[7140.239s] only thing I would do different but
[7142.0s] that&#39;s why we&#39;ve always had the 8 to 10
[7145.119s] I mean is
[7146.92s] because our work was was really good uh
[7151.199s] and we knew what we owned which is what
[7152.56s] gave us the confidence as it was going
[7154.32s] against us and everyone was crying
[7156.159s] uninvestable and ADR and all that
[7158.159s] that&#39;s completely useless noise
[7161.96s] um we kept adding so on the one hand
[7165.84s] we&#39;re more careful
[7168.679s] about buying broken growth stocks that
[7173.199s] haven&#39;t been broken for more than a year
[7175.04s] or two. Uh on the other hand, nothing&#39;s
[7177.84s] nothing&#39;s changed in our framework.
[7179.28s] That&#39;s just kind of technical
[7180.96s] noise. Uh that&#39;ll just give us a hair
[7183.599s] better timing, but we&#39;ll wind up with
[7185.52s] smaller positions because we have less
[7187.28s] time to know the company and less time
[7189.199s] to accumulate. So, I kind of like how it
[7191.44s] worked out. Uh but that would be the one
[7193.28s] key key uh learning lesson. Uh, thanks
[7196.159s] again for all you do. What are your
[7197.599s] thoughts on Coal Company BTU?
[7201.159s] Um, we&#39;ve gone through this one. I think
[7203.92s] the financials look
[7205.719s] fine. Uh, but it&#39;s not something we
[7208.32s] really want to be involved in. We&#39;ll
[7210.56s] just stick with natural gas for
[7213.48s] now. Interestingly enough, what did this
[7215.679s] thing do under Trump
[7219.159s] 1.0? Well, that was co Well, it started
[7221.84s] crashing before CO actually. So,
[7225.599s] uh, all right. I&#39;ll take a quick look.
[7227.76s] You&#39;re you&#39;re probably going to get a
[7228.8s] bounce here, so I don&#39;t want to tell you
[7230.48s] to to pass on it, but cash flow and
[7232.719s] revenues are all turning negative. So,
[7234.4s] I&#39;m not sure that that gives me a lot of
[7236.32s] confidence. The stock price reflects it.
[7238.159s] Question is, let&#39;s take a look at
[7239.8s] quarterly. See if they&#39;re actually
[7241.76s] turning at
[7249.8s] all. I I I don&#39;t want to be involved in
[7252.48s] this.
[7253.56s] Um, all right, River. River, we&#39;re we&#39;re
[7257.599s] playing that through com stock and we
[7259.04s] have a lot of reasons and a lot of outs
[7260.96s] with that. This one, it&#39;s just too
[7262.96s] binary. I had a friend who bought a ton
[7265.199s] of metal private deals in 2011. Thought
[7268.4s] he was a genius. Lost every penny. Uh,
[7271.199s] River Ray, what do you think of super
[7273.56s] lowro shoe vans? Good step in my opinion
[7277.28s] towards marketing toward women. I I
[7279.36s] leave those hard decisions to bracken. I
[7281.119s] just hire the jockey. He takes care of
[7282.719s] that stuff. I think they look super
[7284.159s] cool. Uh I think he&#39;s going to figure it
[7286.239s] out. All he&#39;s got to do, he told you
[7288.0s] what he wants to do. If you listen to
[7289.28s] all the calls, he wanted to detock. And
[7292.4s] then once he detocked, then he was going
[7294.32s] to get the machine going with
[7295.679s] advertising, influencers, etc. So once
[7298.4s] you see these things on uh Sabrina
[7300.48s] Carpenter or whatever, every single
[7302.08s] 12-year-old girl will buy them and it
[7304.159s] will be off to the races and people will
[7305.599s] say, &quot;Wow, how how did the stock go to
[7307.36s] 40 bucks? It&#39;s too expensive now.&quot; And
[7309.44s] then at 60, they&#39;ll buy it. and uh and
[7312.08s] then at 100 it&#39;ll be disbelief, but this
[7314.48s] is not a guy you want to bet against.
[7316.239s] Daniel Borman, thanks for the awesome
[7318.96s] podcast. Tom, what are your thoughts on
[7320.48s] Generrack rebound? I mean, look, we
[7322.56s] bought it below 100. It&#39;s it&#39;s up huge
[7324.639s] for us. So, uh would we put new money to
[7327.04s] work here? 100%. As new client money
[7329.28s] comes in, probably Generrack will be on
[7331.52s] the list at these levels for sure. Uh
[7334.4s] easy peasy. Jack
[7336.76s] Corners Cornes, thanks for all you do
[7339.28s] for us. Uh, ASOS. Okay, we covered that
[7341.679s] for you this week. Nothing yet for us.
[7344.32s] Patrick Kelly hard. Thanks for all your
[7347.119s] hard work. I found you by accident when
[7348.96s] I told a friend that I was going to
[7350.239s] start a position in Alibaba in early
[7352.08s] 2023. Told me to check out your weekly
[7354.08s] podcast because you were also long baba.
[7356.88s] Uh, thanks for helping me stay the
[7358.56s] course through the long sideways grind.
[7360.239s] You&#39;re welcome. It wasn&#39;t an easy time
[7362.0s] and it was a very lonely voice, but
[7365.11s] [Music]
[7373.719s] uh oh, he says, &quot;I&#39;m curious if there
[7376.239s] are any money managers in the business
[7378.0s] that if you found out we&#39;re on the
[7379.44s] opposite side of one of their trades
[7381.36s] would make you go back and check your
[7382.639s] work.&quot; Uh, answer is no. As a matter of
[7385.28s] fact, I&#39;ve had some of my most
[7387.28s] successful positions have had
[7388.8s] multi-billionaires on the other side of
[7390.239s] the trade. I mean, being long the market
[7391.679s] in 2022, I had Ray Dallio on the other
[7393.76s] side of the trade. I mean, who who who
[7395.44s] could scare you more than Ray Dio, one
[7397.04s] of the best hedge fund managers of all
[7398.48s] time. It&#39;s been bearish the whole way up
[7400.4s] since 2022. So,
[7403.4s] um, no, I do my own work. I I don&#39;t read
[7406.8s] a lot of secondhand material. I always
[7408.48s] go to s source material. Um, and
[7412.44s] uh, you know, just as God didn&#39;t give me
[7415.119s] the FOMO gene, he doesn&#39;t give me the
[7416.96s] distraction gene. I do my own work. I
[7419.28s] draw my own conclusions. I, you know, I
[7421.04s] have my filters. Would I put 100% of my
[7423.44s] net worth into into this to buy the
[7425.199s] whole business if JP Morgan was going to
[7426.88s] finance the debt? And the answer has to
[7428.639s] be yes. And to come to a yes answer is
[7430.639s] not casual. It&#39;s not some technical
[7432.719s] stupid breakout pattern like all these
[7434.8s] schmucks talk about on TV. It&#39;s about
[7437.28s] knowing what you own and what are the
[7439.52s] current prospects of cash generation and
[7442.08s] the future prospects of cash generation
[7444.239s] and the leadership and all that goes
[7445.92s] into it and the channel checks and the
[7448.159s] competition analysis and it and just
[7451.639s] instinct, you know, and seeing what
[7453.52s] works and not, you know,
[7455.56s] um and instinct on people is a is a big
[7458.639s] thing as it relates to uh the jockeyies
[7462.4s] that are running your business for you.
[7464.48s] Axel B could uh cover
[7467.8s] that. Zack
[7475.719s] Hong. Okay. He&#39;s asking which college to
[7478.32s] go to. Okay. Rick
[7486.679s] Richard. Okay. So,
[7490.159s] uh Rick, by the way, Rick&#39;s a super
[7492.719s] smart guy. Um, longtime listener,
[7494.719s] congratulations on winning number one
[7496.36s] podcast recently in the hedge fund
[7499.04s] category by the way. Uh, welld deserved.
[7501.04s] Can you explain a little more about your
[7502.4s] framework for E for setting exit
[7504.159s] valuations? Is a lot of comps based on
[7506.0s] enterprise or no has nothing to do with
[7508.639s] comps or any of that? Uh, how how often
[7512.0s] do you find yourself allowing to reset
[7514.239s] the price higher based on new
[7515.44s] information or vice versa, lower exit
[7517.76s] price?
[7520.599s] Um, if I&#39;m taking my exit price down
[7523.52s] lower, I might be thinking about getting
[7525.04s] about getting out of a position
[7526.48s] completely. Uh, that rarely happens.
[7530.28s] Um, and it I can&#39;t think of any time
[7533.199s] it&#39;s ever happened with a full-size
[7534.719s] position. So, uh, I&#39;ll leave that. As
[7536.96s] far as taking it up, I think with
[7539.599s] Bracken, it&#39;s it&#39;s definitely changed. I
[7542.0s] thought it was going to be a quick
[7542.96s] double to 45. Well, that would have been
[7545.36s] a triple to 45 and we&#39;d be out. looking
[7548.32s] at what he&#39;s doing and how he&#39;s thinking
[7550.4s] about it and his background,
[7552.88s] uh, I do think this he&#39;s going to take
[7555.199s] this thing to new highs and beyond. Um,
[7557.76s] but I have to see quarterto quarter, you
[7559.679s] know, what he says and what he does. So
[7561.199s] far, he&#39;s doing exactly what he says,
[7562.96s] just like Shane O Kelly with Advanced
[7564.639s] Auto Parts, by the way. But,
[7567.8s] um, if if if I get a couple quarters
[7571.32s] where they&#39;re changing what they say or
[7574.719s] taking their expectation down, then I
[7576.32s] have to adjust. I haven&#39;t seen that yet.
[7578.159s] Um, will I take it up? I think that&#39;s
[7581.199s] that&#39;s exactly what Bracken talks, but
[7583.36s] it usually has to do with cash flow. It
[7585.76s] usually and and then there&#39;s just a
[7588.159s] million factors that go into when I know
[7591.04s] it&#39;s reached the crescendo and and a lot
[7593.52s] of you have been with me for these exits
[7595.36s] and and I usually get pretty damn close
[7597.76s] to the top, which is just, you know,
[7599.76s] maybe some of it&#39;s luck, but most of it
[7601.679s] is just experience.
[7604.679s] Um and and often times we don&#39;t it&#39;s not
[7608.96s] binary. We&#39;ll usually keep a trailer on
[7610.96s] because just as these companies
[7613.36s] overshoot to the downside, they tend to
[7615.44s] overshoot to the upside. Overshoot to
[7617.119s] the downside with dispondency, overshoot
[7619.44s] to the upside with euphoria. Um so we&#39;re
[7623.119s] getting in in tranches and getting out
[7625.04s] in tranches uh around that intrinsic
[7627.92s] value.
[7630.84s] Um, but a lot of the secret sauce comes
[7633.76s] down
[7634.52s] to cash generation. How it, you know, in
[7638.32s] the businesses that are cyclical, that&#39;s
[7640.4s] pretty easy for us to know where we want
[7642.0s] to be out. Um, and in
[7645.719s] the but but as far as like oh it&#39;s peers
[7650.239s] are trading at this and that I&#39;d be more
[7652.32s] interested in looking at its historic
[7654.28s] multiple channel than its comp multiple
[7657.679s] channel because there are unique
[7659.28s] attributes to each business that we own
[7661.28s] and u and and proprietary modes based on
[7664.079s] the technology andor the products that
[7666.079s] they have andor the brand equity that
[7668.48s] they have. Uh so it&#39;s not a it&#39;s not a
[7671.36s] simple answer, but we do know when
[7673.92s] things are pushed to the top of ranges
[7675.599s] and we do know kind of what the max out
[7678.4s] earnings power is going to be for the
[7679.92s] type of businesses we&#39;re buying. If
[7681.679s] you&#39;re buying the guess the future
[7683.119s] businesses, there&#39;s no there&#39;s no way to
[7684.719s] tell. There&#39;s absolutely which is why we
[7686.56s] don&#39;t do those. If you notice, all the
[7688.239s] businesses we buy have been around for 5
[7690.719s] 10 20 30 years. So we can see how they
[7693.76s] operate through different cycles and how
[7696.4s] they&#39;re proven to operate through cycles
[7697.679s] and where they tend to peak out in the
[7699.199s] next cycle. And and that&#39;s a little
[7701.04s] easier than saying, you know, this
[7703.84s] thing&#39;s the next future of whatever
[7705.92s] curing cancer or, you know, Bitcoin or
[7710.159s] all these things that you&#39;re just
[7711.599s] guessing. And then you got these people
[7713.52s] looking at charts thinking they have
[7714.88s] some edge. It&#39;s it&#39;s comical. So, uh, I
[7718.239s] buy businesses that I can understand how
[7720.079s] they operate, how they recover and where
[7722.239s] they come out in terms of relationship
[7724.8s] to intrinsic value and in excess of it.
[7728.0s] And that&#39;s kind of how we think about
[7729.92s] where we&#39;re getting out in the future.
[7731.92s] And we adjust based on if management
[7734.32s] does a lot better job. And we might miss
[7736.159s] upside on that, but
[7741.159s] um, that&#39;s okay. We know what we have to
[7743.679s] get out of each investment.
[7746.079s] Uh, what is
[7749.0s] this? Jason
[7752.52s] Patel. Oh, okay. He&#39;s talking about the
[7755.04s] China thing in
[7757.8s] CPS.
[7762.36s] Um, Gleb Sitikov, thanks for your
[7765.92s] podcast. It&#39;s probably the most
[7766.96s] efficient two hours spent per week.
[7768.4s] Tremendous value packed in each episode.
[7770.8s] Five below.
[7773.599s] I think a lot of these tariff hit retail
[7776.56s] retailers
[7778.48s] um are going to make a comeback whether
[7781.04s] it&#39;s Dollar
[7783.32s] General, Dollar
[7786.36s] Tree. Let&#39;s take a look at Five Below.
[7789.28s] Probably five below, maybe even Target.
[7792.159s] I think you&#39;re probably okay there.
[7793.92s] Let&#39;s just see here though. I want to
[7795.679s] see.
[7802.239s] Yeah. So, this is a broken momentum
[7804.0s] stock. This might I mean this could
[7806.0s] certainly bounce back straight back up
[7808.0s] for sure. Um, but it also wouldn&#39;t
[7810.88s] surprise me when it&#39;s broken like this
[7812.56s] if it takes a few years to build a base.
[7814.32s] So, that&#39;s kind of the nuance. So, I
[7818.04s] mean, looking at the financials here, my
[7821.199s] guess is we&#39;re going to come to the
[7822.48s] conclusion that it does make sense to
[7824.239s] buy it. But in terms of the reality of
[7828.079s] all the broken investors in this thing,
[7830.96s] uh this was a 10 bagger that is now
[7834.44s] broken. Uh you know, the one takeaway
[7837.119s] would be, okay, let&#39;s talk about it in a
[7839.119s] year and if it&#39;s between, you know, 40
[7841.36s] and 80, let&#39;s start to build a position.
[7843.52s] And you&#39;re like, why would you do that
[7845.04s] if the revenues continue to go up and
[7847.679s] the earnings continue to go up? Because
[7850.0s] so many people chased up here at
[7852.639s] Euphoria, they&#39;re just broken and
[7854.32s] they&#39;re stuck with recency bias that
[7856.0s] it&#39;s broken forever. Like you&#39;re seeing
[7857.84s] like you saw in Baba as it built the
[7859.76s] base, like you saw in PayPal as it built
[7861.679s] the base. These people are broken mofos.
[7864.4s] They lost a lot of money because they
[7866.0s] chased up here after the 26 bagger and
[7868.32s] they bought this thinking it was cheap
[7870.56s] uh when it was a broken momentum stock.
[7872.48s] So, uh, with this one, I would,
[7876.599s] uh,
[7878.119s] I, you know, let&#39;s just take a look at
[7881.28s] the cash
[7885.159s] flow. Yeah, I mean, everything kind of
[7887.52s] looks
[7897.4s] okay. You know, 1.7 billion in debt, 500
[7900.56s] cash. probably gonna be generally okay,
[7903.28s] but I wouldn&#39;t be in a rush. I&#39;d
[7904.88s] probably pass like if I missed the move
[7906.639s] from 60 back to 200. So, I missed it.
[7909.76s] But like if this thing languishes for a
[7911.92s] couple of years uh and builds a base and
[7915.28s] you know all the hurt people get out of
[7917.04s] the stock at the lows uh then it becomes
[7919.52s] more interesting. So that would be a
[7920.719s] lesson that I took away to answer
[7922.56s] Shavein&#39;s uh uh question which was a
[7925.599s] good one. Uh Jimmy
[7927.96s] Jones, Unilver, we&#39;ve covered that.
[7931.76s] Let&#39;s just kind of
[7934.04s] snore.
[7938.84s] Unilver. Yeah. No, not for me. Um
[7946.44s] next. Why are you sending me two this
[7949.88s] week? Uh
[7952.119s] Jeffy,
[7953.639s] wait. If you&#39;re inclined to build an
[7956.199s] income or covered
[7959.079s] calls,
[7966.28s] look, no. Why? Why are you screwing
[7969.04s] around with this kind of nonsense? I
[7971.119s] look, if you like a company, just buy
[7973.84s] the damn company. Why would you want it
[7975.599s] called away from you? all this
[7978.52s] about, oh, the the stock went down. And
[7981.199s] then you hear them say, but I wrote
[7982.56s] cover calls on it, so I got a dollar and
[7985.119s] the stock&#39;s down $40. It&#39;s like, wow,
[7987.04s] you&#39;re brilliant.
[7991.88s] Like, simplify. That&#39;s all I&#39;m going to
[7994.8s] tell you guys. Just simplify your lives.
[7998.079s] Um, and and you don&#39;t have to screw
[8000.719s] around with that stuff because it works
[8002.239s] for a while and it doesn&#39;t. If you want
[8004.079s] to get into the options game, learn how
[8005.679s] to sell them, not how to buy them. Now,
[8007.44s] what we do for clients with the overlays
[8009.36s] and elongated. If you&#39;re going to be a
[8011.599s] buyer, you want to be over the long
[8013.36s] term. If you&#39;re going to be a seller,
[8014.4s] you want to be in the next 30 days where
[8016.4s] you get the time decay. But that&#39;s
[8018.159s] that&#39;s like a 4hour conversation, which
[8020.239s] I&#39;m not going to have. Uh Jason Zen
[8028.079s] uh Jason goes into trade desk based on
[8031.36s] last week and he has experience with it
[8033.36s] and he&#39;s he&#39;s a pass trying to give me
[8035.599s] some insight on the technology. I
[8037.679s] appreciate that cuz I asked for it. John
[8039.92s] Lou by sheer chance came across your
[8041.76s] weekly podcast confidently say it helped
[8044.4s] me find my footing in investing going
[8046.159s] forward. I appreciate all the work
[8047.36s] you&#39;ve done.
[8049.8s] Uh, okay. So, the CPS question was
[8052.8s] answered. Carolyn H, first, thank you
[8055.44s] for helping us all understand what makes
[8057.76s] Mr. Market tick. You&#39;re welcome. By the
[8060.159s] way, thank you for all these kind
[8061.84s] comments, guys, because a lot of work
[8063.84s] does go into this. And um, all right.
[8067.52s] Grateful to be out of the mainstream
[8068.719s] view of stocks and into the method of
[8070.159s] understanding value in business I own
[8071.76s] part of. There&#39;s been a lot of talk
[8073.52s] about recession lady lately, which got
[8075.52s] me thinking. Obviously, recession
[8078.0s] shouldn&#39;t change the framework for
[8079.199s] picking high quality business at a
[8080.4s] dislocated price, but does it change the
[8082.56s] strategy for inquiring them? Perhaps
[8084.32s] they might take longer for price to
[8085.599s] reach intrinsic value. Anything else to
[8087.44s] be thinking about? I think you answered
[8088.56s] your own question. If you get a
[8089.679s] recession, it just takes longer. Um, but
[8093.119s] if you start getting in the predict a
[8095.36s] recession game, uh, good luck because
[8098.0s] you&#39;ll be in the DIO camp for the last
[8100.0s] three years and miss 100% ups. VSCO
[8104.76s] [Music]
[8107.96s] stock. Uh, Victorious
[8112.92s] Secret. They destroyed this brand. I
[8115.92s] mean, the bottom line
[8118.52s] is there&#39;s no way I&#39;m going to say this
[8120.719s] that is going to sound nice. So, I&#39;m
[8122.4s] probably not going to say everything
[8123.599s] that&#39;s on my mind. But the bottom line
[8125.599s] is lingerie is supposed to be sexy.
[8128.4s] Okay? When you try to make it something
[8130.56s] other than that, then you&#39;re not selling
[8132.4s] lingerie and you lose the cache for the
[8134.32s] whole brand. When Victoria&#39;s Secret
[8136.079s] hummed, they had the supermodels. Now
[8138.32s] they don&#39;t have superm models because
[8139.52s] they don&#39;t want to pay them all that
[8140.56s] money, so they just put women up. And
[8143.36s] long story short, I think this is
[8145.52s] completely destroyed. My guess is
[8147.84s] they&#39;re trying to reverse that. Um, VCO
[8171.84s] Yeah, there&#39;s no thing is there there&#39;s
[8175.28s] some stability here, but there&#39;s no
[8177.84s] inflection yet.
[8180.56s] And
[8182.36s] that&#39;s so all I can tell you is I would
[8186.079s] want to understand is there a new CEO?
[8189.28s] What&#39;s their plan? What is their track
[8191.04s] record of
[8192.359s] success? And on those bases, you know,
[8196.16s] if they if they get back to their roots,
[8198.559s] kind of like what Vans is trying to do
[8200.479s] right now.
[8202.24s] [Music]
[8203.399s] Um, and that&#39;s what Bracken did. He
[8205.76s] spent time getting to know the family
[8207.2s] and learning the business from the 60s
[8209.359s] forward. he knows the business like the
[8210.96s] back of his hand and the culture and
[8212.96s] everything else then I think there&#39;s a
[8214.639s] chance but you know that&#39;s that&#39;s hours
[8216.719s] and hours of conference calls learning
[8218.479s] the whole thing and um it looks like
[8221.28s] they might have troughed here so I think
[8223.04s] it warrants further investigation I do
[8227.2s] and have heard in art right reading
[8230.0s] articles etc that they are moving back
[8232.559s] to toward what made them successful so
[8235.12s] if you can get some confidence around
[8236.719s] that um it&#39;s
[8240.439s] probably worth a look.
[8246.439s] Um, yeah, share count has come down. So,
[8249.359s] some things are going in the right
[8250.559s] direction. Sounds like they&#39;ve got
[8252.16s] someone new running it and doing it
[8254.479s] properly. So, Medi, thank you for
[8256.639s] bringing it to us. I think it warrants
[8258.84s] further
[8264.599s] exploration. All right, I think we got a
[8266.88s] couple more here.
[8273.359s] Oh, Valeris offshore
[8278.92s] driller. Okay, so Vle wants to know
[8282.0s] about Rick Hospitality, which is a
[8284.16s] rollup of nudie bars. Okay, the guy who
[8289.04s] did this, I got pitched on this when I
[8291.76s] was in Puerto Rico, and the pitch is
[8293.92s] fantastic. The guy who actually runs it
[8296.96s] understands return on invested capital,
[8299.439s] understands how to do a rollup,
[8301.2s] understands how to do a business. What
[8302.719s] he doesn&#39;t understand is the fact that
[8304.639s] no institutional money manager that
[8306.559s] wants to keep his job is going to have a
[8308.719s] big position in strip clubs and that&#39;s
[8311.12s] why they&#39;re never going to get the
[8312.24s] sponsorship that they know. So, I would
[8315.439s] bet on the guy if he went into another
[8317.439s] rollup. fact that he&#39;s in this roll up,
[8319.439s] it&#39;s going to be very very very hard to
[8322.08s] get the type of sponsorship you need to
[8324.0s] have a monster winner. So on that basis,
[8326.88s] I&#39;m a pass. Um
[8329.84s] uh let&#39;s take a look at Aaris. These are
[8332.24s] all the guys wanting to get offshore
[8334.679s] drillers. Um the problem with this one
[8337.2s] is it hasn&#39;t been around long enough for
[8338.88s] me to be comfortable with it, but I&#39;ll
[8340.88s] take a quick look at the financials
[8342.16s] because I do think these services are
[8343.84s] going to move. I would pick something
[8345.92s] easier like you know maybe Hallebertton
[8350.519s] or maybe no National Oil Well Varco but
[8353.76s] that one&#39;s a stretch or maybe
[8356.92s] um Slumber I mean that&#39;s one&#39;s kind of a
[8359.76s] no-brainer but the key is there&#39;s not
[8361.679s] enough margin of safety. So this is
[8363.439s] still negative free cash flow revenues
[8365.519s] are going up. It&#39;s too new for me. So
[8368.719s] I&#39;m I&#39;m a pass on this. Um and I&#39;ll
[8372.639s] leave it at that.
[8375.399s] Okay, that&#39;s client
[8379.16s] inquiry. And that&#39;s it. So, we&#39;ll be
[8381.359s] back next week, same time, same place.
[8383.04s] In the meantime, make it a great one.
[8385.359s] Thank you for tuning in. Bye for
