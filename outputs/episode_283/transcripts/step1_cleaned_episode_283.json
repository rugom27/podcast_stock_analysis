  "cleaned_transcript": "### FEATURED_COMPANY_DEEP_DIVES\nwe had the most incredible week and the most incredible opportunity to interview the CEO of Cooper Standard, Mr. Jeff Edwards, the chairman and CEO. And you know, you&#39;re going to be blown away by how Jeff explains the company, where it&#39;s been, where it is, and where it&#39;s going. Uh, but one of the key themes of our podcast for the last 5 years has been to burden yourself with the facts. And my good friend and client Damian L got me these caps. They&#39;re Nike. Uh they say burden yourself with the facts. Great Hill Capital. Absolutely incredible. Tag still on. We&#39;ve got 10 of these. And what I want to do this week is we&#39;re going to run a promotion for the 10 or so best responses. is you&#39;re going to comment below in the YouTube section of the comment section and say what was your number one takeaway or what did you learn from listening to Jeff Edwards in this interview which they&#39;ve posted on their uh investor relations part of their website you can go to cooperstandard.com. Obviously, we are large shareholders of Cooper Standards, so full disclosure there. We got involved with the company in May of 2022. We thought we were geniuses buying the stock in the fives. Uh, and then it immediately went into the threes and we bought more because we had done our work. Uh, and the stock was down because they needed to refinance the debt. They did. that largely gives them runway uh well to 2027 and beyond. And we&#39;re going to talk a little bit about that. We think well beyond. Uh and uh the idea for getting involved in Cooper Standard was actually uh a person that I look up to tremendously who recently passed is Charlie Mer. And Charlie Munger did a very similar investment in the 2001 recession, a cyclical trough in the industry. Uh, and this is a pretty regular occurrence as Jeff will tell you in the auto business. It is very cyclical. Uh, and uh, Charlie read an article in Baronss and he invested $10 million in Tenico when it was down some 95%. They refinanced the debt. He turned the 10 million into 80 million in a reasonable amount of time and then he gave that 80 million to Leelu who invested in China which was out of fa favor and turned it into a half a billion dollars. So, two chess moves, a half a billion dollars. That&#39;s the good news. I think we&#39;re going to do a lot better with Cooper Standard than Charlie did in Tenico.\n\n obviously, we are large shareholders of Cooper Standards, so full disclosure there.

And that&#39;s why we have our very special guest again, chairman and CEO of Cooper Standard, Mr. Jeff Edwards. Thank you again. So, I think I&#39;ll get right down to it here. Uh, and I want to ask you some\n### FEATURED_COMPANY_DEEP_DIVES\nquestions . I&#39;m usually on the other side of the question, so bear with me as an interviewer. But um first question is in your most recent conference call, you provided guidance that suggests Cooper Standard will continue to expand margins in 2025 despite an expected decline in North North American light vehicle production and essentially flat revenue. Uh you also mentioned launching new business at higher variable contribution margins than in the past. A few\n\nquestions . I&#39;m usually on the other side of the question, so bear with me as an interviewer. But um first question is in your most recent conference call, you provided guidance that suggests Cooper Standard will continue to expand margins in 2025 despite an expected decline in North North American light vehicle production and essentially flat revenue. Uh you also mentioned launching new business at higher variable contribution margins than in the past. A few\n### FEATURED_COMPANY_DEEP_DIVES\nquestions  here Jeeoff. Uh first is that how you drive the margin expansion? What&#39;s driving the higher uh uh margin expansion the VCM? And how much higher can this get? That&#39;s a good question, Tom. And I I&#39;ll start by talking about the things that we can control, right? I mean ultimately um I I think the industry we we talk a lot about uh about price but to be fair uh with inside Cooper Standard about four or five years ago as we were facing what felt like uh an insurmountable headwind uh be it pandemics or be it uh industry downturn whatever you want to call it. uh we really turned our attention internal and and started focusing on our our fixed costs and and really driving fixed costs to a uh an all-time low level as we sat here today and our teams everywhere in every region went to work on this because basically what we said is we&#39;re either going to make money in every region with each of our two products or we&#39;re going to do something else. Uh so it really put a laser-like focus on on uh those fixed costs which we&#39;ve taken out consistently over the last five years. So that&#39;s certainly driven a lot of this margin expansion. Uh the other thing that we did related to variable contribution margin is we reestablished what we felt were our fair hurdle rates when we went into the customer and started bidding on programs really in each region with each each customer. uh we established these hurdle rates and and we found very quickly that that with our technology and with our ability to execute as well as we do that that those price points were holding. And so in in combination with taking the cost down, controlling what we can control and at the same time establishing a very clear process internally so that every salesperson and every leader, every plant manager in the world understood what those hurdle rates were. So they were doing their part to take the cost down and those people that go to the customer to win new business had to make sure that we did it at a price point that was fair. Fair for the customer and fair for us. And those were the two reasons that you see the margin expansion that you see. So we&#39;re really proud of that. I I think probably most importantly it&#39;s a sustainable uh business model. So we&#39;ll continue to do our fair share of taking costs out as we improve efficiencies in our plants. There&#39;s still a few things that we would like to do around the world, but most of it is is uh where we want it. The last piece related to to what we can control is our material cost as a percent of sale. And this year, we&#39;re really working with our supply base. Uh working with our engineering teams to provide us different options as it relates to the decisions that we&#39;re taking related to material costs for both our fluid and our ceiling business. So we&#39;re not done yet, but at least uh certainly the trend is in the right direction. Fantastic. Fantastic. So let&#39;s assume you can drive a variable contribution margin of uh improvement of around 500 basis points over the next two to three years as those new contacts uh contracts kick in and and roll over. Um assuming an apocalyptic scenario, which is I what I like to do as an investor. uh if you if you can underwrite the downside, the upside will take care of itself. Um that US production volumes don&#39;t even grow. So So first cycle, and by the way, this would be the first cycle peak since the 1970s. That didn&#39;t peak over 18 million plus units since 1970. And by the way, back then the population was 40% less than it is today. uh and we&#39;ll talk a little bit about that. But this still implies this is again apocalyptic scenarios. We stay in the 15s. Um we&#39;re looking at uh an additional 135 million of IBIDA or total 330 million of IBIDA. So if my math is correct, assuming these apocalyptic volumes in the mid15s, this business can earn5 to $6 a share two to three years out on margin expansion alone. Uh th this is a testament to how you&#39;ve managed the business through this ex extended cycle trough which uh basically was a one in aundred year event. I mean the pandemic and uh the the industry cycle all at the same time. So number one, is this a reasonable way to think about the business? This is kind of my my operating model. And if so, say a little more how you did that because it&#39;s it&#39;s just mindboggling to me that that uh um your execution has been so quick and so precise to put us in a position that this is a reality. Well, thank you. It&#39;s very kind. I can&#39;t confirm the numbers that you just rattled off there, but but I can tell you that directionally you&#39;re correct. Okay. And then how we how we accomplish that, I guess, is probably the most important thing. So really, I I I mentioned it in the in the first question, but but in addition to to focusing on taking the cost down and and being more consistent about the pricing side as well, we reorganized here last year. So we&#39;re we&#39;re about a year and a quarter into this new organization structure where where we have three businesses now. We have our ceiling business, we have our fluid business, and then we have our industrial and specialty product group, which is a much smaller non-automotive business that we have some good growth plans for. But sticking primarily with sealing and fluid for today&#39;s discussion, Tom, uh it allowed us to put two presidents in charge, one each of those businesses, one for each of those businesses. We gave them their own dedicated teams from manufacturing to engineering to purchasing everything they need uh within their team to drive the day-to-day performance of those businesses. So uh didn&#39;t matter what 20 countries were doing business. It didn&#39;t matter uh that that 21,000 employees come to work every day, half of them in each business. Uh but what are we going to do? How are we going to get those teams focused? Give them the resources. give them the the investment dollars that they need to grow the business profitably, but at the same time hold them accountable uh for driving uh VCM margin expansion and ultimately returning this business to double digit EBIDA and double digit return on invested capital and and that&#39;s exactly what we saw happen uh in 2024 and why uh our guidance for 25 suggests we&#39;re going to return to those double-digit EBDA numbers. numbers for both of those businesses at the end of 25. Uh as we start 20 uh6 we clearly will be a double digit IBIDA and a double-digit return on invested capital company. Okay, that&#39;s that&#39;s great. Are you going to slide back down the mountain? No. And why is because the way we have structured these two businesses, the leaders that we have in charge, and we&#39;re not asking people to do three and four jobs, right? they they can stay focused within the lanes. Our plants pretty much are divided up by sealing and fluid. So t\n\n### FEATURED_COMPANY_DEEP_DIVES\nwe reorganized here last year. So we&#39;re we&#39;re about a year and a quarter into this new organization structure where where we have three businesses now. We have our ceiling business, we have our fluid business, and then we have our industrial and specialty product group, which is a much smaller non-automotive business that we have some good growth plans for.

Our plants pretty much are divided up by sealing and fluid. So t\n\nI think S&P 15.1 uh million production. But if you just step back when these cycles peaked, whether it was in 2005, 2017, 1987, all between 18 and 20 for for short periods of the spikes. You know, in the 80s, our population, the census was 226 million people. Now we&#39;re at 331 million people. So, uh, it it, you know, we&#39;re just looking for that 16 to 18 or 17 to 18, but on the basis of population and the age of our population with so many people being 34, 35 when they buy new cars, um, I think we could wind up getting surprised dramatically to the upside. But that&#39;s just the whipped cream. We&#39;re we&#39;re dealing with basease scenarios. So, now that we&#39;ve gone through an apocalyptic scenario, Jeff, let&#39;s um go uh go through what it looks like uh for every cycle for the past 40 years when we peak between 17 to 18 million in production.\n### MISCELLANEOUS\nLet&#39;s call it 17.5 million round numbers. By my calculation, CPS had approximately $99 in revenue for every vehicle produced in North America in 2024 on a simple average basis. So, you know, round numbers, uh, let&#39;s call it 190 a carish for servicing half of the total cars, but let&#39;s just do it simply, 99 a car at a more historically normalized 17.5 million peak production or 2 million more vehicles than last year. uh you would expect to gain nearly 200 million of additional revenue considering this is an operating leverage play and your break even is call it 15 to 15 and a half production free cash flow positive with most fixed costs in place we expect most of the incremental uh production to go to the bottom line at a higher uh VCM of approximately 35% this would be approximately 70 million in incremental profit or nearly four to $5 of $4 of additional EPS over our $5 to $6 EPS base case. I mean, round numbers at peak cycle production if it&#39;s 17.59 $10 a share in EPS base case from our side, not you know I I I know I know the position you&#39;re in. Uh this is re is this a reasonable not guaranteed in any way uh or any guidance way to think about it? In other words, if you were to say, &quot;Uh, Tom, look, I can&#39;t guarantee that, but your ar your argument is flawed here, here, and here.&quot; Uh, do you you can you legitimately say your my argument is flawed in that way of thinking about it if volumes normalize the way they have going back every single cycle for the last 40 years. And also uh not even accounting for the fact that the population uh was 32% lower in the 1980s. Yeah. First, I agree with your premise. Let&#39;s let&#39;s say it that way in in terms of uh the demand. We believe that that t\n\nthrough an apocalyptic scenario, Jeff, let&#39;s um go uh go through what it looks like uh for every cycle for the past 40 years when we peak between 17 to 18 million in production. Let&#39;s call it 17.5 million round numbers. By my calculation, CPS had approximately $99 in revenue for every vehicle produced in North America in 2024 on a simple average basis.

I mean, round numbers at peak cycle production if it&#39;s 17.59 $10 a share in EPS base case from our side, not you know I I I know I know the position you&#39;re in. Uh this is re is this a reasonable not guaranteed in any way uh or any guidance way to think about it? In other words, if you were to say, &quot;Uh, Tom, look, I can&#39;t guarantee that, but your ar your argument is flawed here, here, and here.&quot; Uh, do you you can you legitimately say your my argument is flawed in that way of thinking about it if volumes normalize the way they have going back every single cycle for the last 40 years. And also uh not even accounting for the fact that the population uh was 32% lower in the 1980s. Yeah. First, I agree with your premise. Let&#39;s let&#39;s say it that way in in terms of uh the demand. We believe that that t\n\nupside for many of the reasons that you you talked about. I I usually don&#39;t uh permit that discussion uh in this room because obviously uh we don&#39;t control it. So we tend to focus our attention on what we can control and not get too excited about what the what the volumes uh could be based on the type of of data that you just uh you just recited. But clearly uh Tom, we believe that there&#39;s there&#39;s uh pent-up demand. We also believe in in many of the reasons that you just described uh that this is just around the corner. But but most folks um that get paid to forecast automotive volume don&#39;t usually uh do that in advance. At least that&#39;s my experience over 40 years, I guess, is that uh we we tend to see them forecasting increases after the increases have started. uh doesn&#39;t work that way when it&#39;s going the other side. So, I&#39;m not sure why, but anyway, that&#39;s that&#39;s kind of how it how it goes. Your estimate for uh VCM is is also in the right range. So, we certainly uh are are u planning for uh an increase in volume. We just don&#39;t know when that&#39;s going to come. But, uh you mentioned guidance. So when I talked about the guidance here in the last earnings call for for 25, I mean we we were certainly uh conservative in in terms of uh this conversation, right? We used the the numbers typically all suppliers use uh S&amp;P to to help gauge what the what the next 12 months going to be and even what the next uh two or three years is is going to be. and and while there&#39;s some increases uh out there forecasted, they&#39;re certainly not the level that that you and I are hoping for or discussing uh with this particular question. But I&#39;m sure that uh increases are going to be coming. I just don&#39;t know when. Uh, but I also will say that that the numbers that we talked about on that last earnings call in in terms of what you&#39;re going to expect to see from our increasing EBDA each year, even on these suppressed volumes and our return on invested capital with these suppressed volumes. Um, it&#39;s it&#39;s very exciting because we&#39;re we&#39;re able to to make money and we&#39;ll be we&#39;ll be generating more and more cash each year without the increase in volume. So when they do come, uh, we&#39;re pretty excited about what that means for our company and and how much stronger it will be, uh, for the next couple decades as a result. So it&#39;s very exciting to think about, uh, I just don&#39;t really allow it to distract us because there&#39;s not much I can do about it. Yeah. In in my business, we say you you take care of the down, you protect the downside, the upside will take care of itself. And that&#39;s what you&#39;ve done through the execution and uh, right sizing the ship to be ready for for thing uh, good things coming forward. So, we appreciate that. Um, three key reasons I invested with you in May of 2022 and I remember we had a talk in August when we had a chance to meet that that time. Uh, and I&#39;ve continued to add a significant amount of shares uh across accounts and personally is number one I I want to acknowledge your respect for equity. Uh there are actually less shares outstanding today than in two 2017. uh about 17.56 million versus 17.69 on December 31st, 2017. Uh second reason was uh part of your compensation is tied to return on invested capital. That&#39;s a very important metric for me. Uh and three, you own a lot of stock. You&#39;re a partner. You know, you&#39;re we&#39;re investing right alongside with you and you have skin in the game, which is very important to us. Uh can you speak to your and and the board? you are the chairman but but the boards as well philosophy on all three of these concepts and why this culture is critical to owners as the cycle returns. Thanks. I yeah I think first of all the board the management team uh we we have a responsibility to behave in the best interest of all of our stakeholders of course but none more important than the shareholders. So, I I am very proud uh and you probably have seen the recent um insider buying activity that that&#39;s gone on. I will just say it. Our our lead director and our uh chief financial officer here in in the in the past month have have added to their uh their shares. I own 2% of the company sitting here as the chairman and CEO of of Cooper Standard. So, I can I can assure you that that it&#39;s in our own self-interest, but it&#39;s also uh our responsibility and we take it uh very serious and and I agree with you that that most investors um talk to me about that. They they want to understand uh the ownership and the requirements and how we&#39;re paid and what the long-term incentive plans are versus the annual incentive plans. and and I think we&#39;ve always uh prided ourselves all the way back to to 2012 to today that that those uh metrics and the way we&#39;re were measured in and the the compensation for for the management team aligns with shareholder expectations and values and uh obviously the last five or six years have been extremely challenging for a lot of reasons but uh at the end of the day I I&#39;m proud of the company I&#39;m proud to be a significant owner in the company and I I will continue to uh to make sure that we uphold that that standard. Yeah. Well, thank thank you for that. And for those of you just round numbers to put it in English, 2% of the company is, you know, give or take 350,000 shares. That is a serious partner right there. Uh uh we have uh more than that and we&#39;re excited to be a partner right alongside you. Uh uh but but pleased that um that&#39;s that&#39;s material. So, uh, next is we&#39;ve typically pointed to new vehicle incentives as a leading indicator for STAR. Uh, after after incentives as a percentage of the average transaction price bottomed out in September 2022 at 2.1%, we&#39;ve seen a strong recovery back to 7.2%, although that&#39;s still below the 9.8% average of the past two decades. In English, for those of you who are listening, if it&#39;s call it 10% of a $50,000 car, they would be giving 5,000 incentives uh to get you down to the dealership to buy one. Uh with new vehicle prices seeing a significant jump over the past few years and an all-time record gap now between new and used average total prices. Could you comment on the role of incentives as a potential catalyst for new vehicle sales and improving profitability? And could you also share your thoughts on the relationship between incentives and overall production volumes? Sure, I&#39;d be happy to. And it&#39;s something that we track so it&#39;s easy for me to to tell you what we think there. Uh first of all, the constraints on produ production that really resulted from the from the pandemic and the supply chain uh disruptions uh that that followed. Uh I mean, I I sure hope it&#39;s a once in a-lifetime event. I can assure you it&#39;s the first time I&#39;ve seen anything like this in in the 40 years that I&#39;ve been part of this industry. So I I think that that as we move through it, um that&#39;s exactly what it&#39;ll be. it&#39;ll be history and and I don&#39;t think it&#39;s going to repeat itself anytime uh anytime soon. Uh but I do believe that that as inventories get reestablished and as supply chains uh smooth out and become normalized again uh that that there&#39;s just so many great vehicles. And you think about the three powertrains today, whether it&#39;s it&#39;s the ice engine, whether it&#39;s the battery electric vehicle, or whether you like something in between with plug-in hybrids. uh there&#39;s great great vehicles out there and and I think the competition uh has never been better and and so for consumers I I think that pent-up demand that you and I discussed earlier it it&#39;s a reality and and what I&#39;ve also seen over the course of of a few decades in the business is when that competition heats up incentives do start uh to build in fact we track that as part of a leading indicator within our company so that we maintain, you know, you get the you get the releases from the customers, which is what we we go to the bank with, uh, so to speak. Uh, but but incentives as as you see them increasing across the board, you typically see volume, uh, increase as well because dealers are moving the the product, the product is outstanding. It&#39;s world class. About anything you want, you can go get. Uh, I I do believe that u that we&#39;ve seen incentives increase last year. We&#39;ll see them increase this year and as a result you&#39;ll see u vehicles moving off of dealers lots at a faster pace and as a result you&#39;ll see production volumes increase to support that. That&#39;s what I believe. Thank you. And and god forbid we actually get uh Donald President Trump was talking about tax deductibility of uh interest on auto loans. That would be an additional kicker which is pretty wild. Uh this past quarter you announced that fluid the fluid handling segment sales are expected to increase by more than 50% over the next five years with the segments weighted average CPV cost per vehicle expected to go up by more than 30%. I know the ceiling systems business is pretty similar in terms of CPV across different powertrains, but could you share your thoughts on the outlook for the ceiling business and what kind of opportunities you see over the same time frame? Is that 30% uh CPV increase on the fluid handling baked into the margin expansion we discussed? Yeah. So for sealing, it&#39;s it&#39;s an interesting uh dynamic there, no pun intended, because part of the sealing business is called dynamic seals, and the other part is called static seals. I won&#39;t bore you with which is which, but in many cases, the automakers don&#39;t source all of the static and all of the dynamic to the same ceiling company. So in certain vehicles, uh there&#39;s more than one sealing company providing those those products. Uh so to answer your question, yes, there&#39;s an opportunity for us to considerably increase whether it&#39;s dynamic seal or whether it&#39;s static seal depending on which one we happen to have on a vehicle. And what would cause that? Well, our innovation would cause that because we have now just announced uh recently that that we have innovation for our our new static ceiling system. I&#39;m sorry, our dynamic ceiling system that would provide uh customers with the opportunity to source us for a product that would reduce their weight by 40%. Wow. And it&#39;s also um more recyclable than anything that they have in the marketplace. So, a 40% weight reduction uh for a particular ceiling system, I think, will help differentiate that business. So, let&#39;s see. We&#39;ve already been sourced on one major EV program. It&#39;s just out this year. I mentioned it in the last earnings call. So, I&#39;m very excited about that. So, uh how do we get more ceiling business innovate, provide our customers solutions that that they can only get from us helps drive their cost down, helps them meet their uh metrics as well as it relates to lightweing. Uh I believe our ceiling team will benefit from that all over the world. Uh and I know the the Chinese OEMs are looking at it right now in a in a big way. uh related to uh our fluid business. I mentioned that there&#39;s two things going on there. If I just use ICE vehicles as a baseline for our fluid business, if we have an all-electric vehicle, because of the complexity and the content, that that content per vehicle actually goes up about 20%. If you look at a ice vehicle versus a hybrid electric vehicle, the content of our fluid business goes up 80%. Uh so yes, we are rooting for more hybrids uh to hit the market. Fortunately, that is going to be the case, especially here in a North American market. And I know many people talk about the electric vehicle in China and how the perception is that it&#39;s just all electric. But I will tell you that about half of the vehicles that are being produced over there today, and it&#39;s a very very important fact for Cooper Standard, it&#39;s plug-in hybrid. So in addition to battery electric vehicles, they also have plug-in hybrids. So our fluid business in a market where 30 million units are being produced as we speak. Uh the opportunity to grow our China business is huge. And and uh they love our products and and we&#39;re doing quite well. We&#39;ve returned to a 10% uh EBDA already with our China business. Wow. uh despite the fact that the western OEMs are losing share and that was a big part of our our company in China in fact we were probably 90% 90% of our revenue was western OE just four years ago and obviously their their volumes have have come way down if I fast forward to 2026 uh we will have replaced all of that revenue that we&#39;ve lost with Chinese domestics and we&#39;ll have increased it by over hund00 million. So our Chinese business is doing extremely well. Fluid uh is a big part of that, but also our ceiling business. So we&#39;re doing quite well in that region with our ceiling business too. So small fact uh uh related to to plug-in hybrids and in the Chinese market uh that not many people talk about, but but it is a fact. And it&#39;s interesting because the North American market as you well know uh was predicted or at least forecasted uh to go much faster related to EVs and you know there was the numbers out there 30% by by 2030 which would have still been good for Cooper Standard. I think that&#39;s uh slowed down a little bit. I think it&#39;s still a fast growing market, but hybrid very quickly with every customer here in in the North American market, they are launching plans for hybrid uh vehicles. So again, our content goes up by 80% if a hybrid rolls off the end of the line. So it&#39;s a pretty cool fact. Yeah, that&#39;s absolutely amazing, Jeeoff. I think when I originally underwrote the investment in 2022, I had China at zero dollars and I think I had uh hybrids and EVs uh not even factored in into our internal models here. So all of this question I I guess I didn&#39;t answer the port the portion of the question that you said is that factored in what I just said for 25 26 and 27 and it is not. Wow. So there would be upside to that because the customers hadn&#39;t announced uh all these hybrids yet. They&#39;re just talking about um hybrids are coming, hybrids are coming and we really didn&#39;t have uh enough detail by customer as to what that meant and when they were going to be launching. Uh so these are the facts that we&#39;ll have that type of an increase in content per vehicle, but but it was too early to model it in in any of these financial numbers. So uh as as we book this business uh then we will update our our forecasts accordingly and I think last year the uh about 40% of the business that we booked was on on hybrid uh vehicles. So uh it&#39;s coming fast. Wow. Well that that is super exciting. Just just for those of you who haven&#39;t been following for for some time since 2022, um Cooper Standard in 2017 at the peak uh uh traded at $146 a share and earned about $719 a share. So it traded about a 20 times multiple. We&#39;ve talked about our internal uh uh estimates with Jeff here of what we think the company can do on normalized volumes. So whether the market assigns us a 20 times multiple again on that bigger number we discussed earlier or a 10 times multiple the key is we think at Great Hill Capital and Tom Hayes opinion not advice uh consult with your financial advisor uh the upside is is phenomenal and and we just keep getting more information and things look more and more positive. All the things that we had underwritten to zero are now showing huge upside growth potential and we&#39;re pretty exciting. Uh over the past 2 years, Jeeoff, it looks like capex as a percentage of sales has been much lower, maybe 2 to 3% range compared to historically 5 to 6%. Given all the new business wins, do you see capex staying in this lower range moving forward or renormalizing? Yeah, we&#39;ve done a nice job of of managing capex through this uh this period of time. And and while I think it&#39;s probably unrealistic to I think we finished at 1.8% 8% uh in in 24. Uh it was that was a lot to do with the timing of the the launches of new programs and things like that. I I would say consider 3 to 3 and a half%. Uh I think that&#39;s probably where we&#39;ll we&#39;ll end up being being quote unquote in a normal range. And keep in mind a lot of that has been driven by just terrific work from our our manufacturing manufacturing engineering and product engineering folks. I mean probably five six years ago they started on this this uh track uh to make sure that that we are able to reuse the capital much more than we have in the past. They came up with standardized design so we didn&#39;t need as much capital variation as we did in the past. Worked with our customers to to get the specifications that we needed uh to really help on the capital side of the business. So from from all of our engineers to our customers engineers, uh this has really been a a success story. And in the days of us having to spend five or six% uh on on capital expenditures are are gone. Uh three to three and a half I think is probably the the more normal number going forward. That that&#39;s that&#39;s amazing amazing execution. All I can say. Um, a couple more here. After the announcement of the one-mon reprieve from the 25% tariff for US automakers, there&#39;s been talk that many automakers might start racing to build out inventories as quickly as possible. Is the industry expecting to see this trend play out? And what&#39;s your take on it? Yeah, I think it&#39;s it&#39;s uh interesting and and certainly the the volumes here in the first quarter uh I think the strong volumes in the first quarter probably are reflecting some of that sentiment. I guess I really don&#39;t I really don&#39;t know. I I I tend to to not get out ahead of my blockers and have these conversations. The blockers here are the customers and and the OEMs are dealing you know with this directly. But as it relates to the the supply base and the industry in general, I guess if if you&#39;ve been part of it for 40 years, uh it&#39;s okay to talk about it in its in its uh fullest context. I I really believe that that uh there&#39;s good intention, I think, being discussed um in Washington related to to tariffs and the industry. uh but I do think that that given the way the supply chain and given the way the OEMs uh have established the infrastructure and the overall business model it would be very very destructive in the short medium and and probably everything but the longest term you could think of uh to go this way. So, I I tend to think that if that&#39;s the case, and and nobody&#39;s looking for it to be that destructive, uh that it probably isn&#39;t going to be as as long or drawn out as maybe it would need to be in order for it to be productive. Uh so given that situation uh I&#39;m I&#39;m hopeful that uh that cooler heads will prevail and and we&#39;ll we&#39;ll manage through this in a way that that doesn&#39;t uh disrupt the momentum really that the industry has has built here and and we&#39;re talking about pent up demand. We&#39;re talking about great vehicles ready for market. We&#39;re talking about consumers that that for the first time hopefully are are going to be in a geopolitical environment that that gives them uh hope and and secondly in an overall economic environment that talks about lower interest rates and talks about uh GDP and and talks about inflation in positive terms and this again will create the the desire of for consumers to go out and and uh take advantage of the great vehicles that are available. And I I would just really u hesitate to think that that there would be a policy coming out of our government that would uh that would destroy that value and destroy that particular situation for the auto industry. It&#39;s just it takes too long to make the moves that that some folks think can be made uh by applying these tariffs. This is just my opinion. I&#39;m just a small supplier here in Northville, Michigan, so I probably don&#39;t catch the whole the drift of the whole thing. But, uh, you know, that&#39;s my that&#39;s my personal opinion on it, Tom. Yeah. And and the question is whether people are going to spend tens of billions of dollars to stand up factories in, you know, Mississippi for three and a half years when the factories won&#39;t even be built by the time the rules change again. But that&#39;s another story we could talk about. Um uh looking at the current industry outlook, North American light vehicle production is expected to come in at 15.1 million with SAR projected between 16.0 to 16.3. And I got to say when that press release came out for Q1, I was like, wait a second. I I had the uh SAR and production numbers overlaid for 20some years, and it&#39;s basically the same line. And I&#39;m like, how did they get this million gap sandbagging me on this call? But anyway, uh there have been instances. They&#39;re not very common, Jeff. I just want to say. Uh but if these forecasts hold, it would be one of the largest production deficits we&#39;ve seen in quite some time with the only other times being coming out of the pandemic and before that the 2008 financial crisis. Every time we&#39;ve had a deficit of over 1 million units, again, very rare. Jeff, uh, production has usually had a hockey stick style recovery in the following years. What are your thoughts on this kind of production catchup? And what sort of implications do you expect if current forecasts hold true? Yeah. Well, I, as I said a couple times, I I believe we&#39;ll see a ramp up in production volume. I just wish I could predict uh when, but I think it&#39;s sooner than than later. I I agree with uh with your statement. Uh and we&#39;ve certainly changed our strategy, right? I I talked about how we changed the entire uh organization structure of of the company. Uh we&#39;ve certainly gone all in as it it relates to to our capital strategy and to to driving innovation, investing in innovation and providing customers with solutions that that otherwise they they wouldn&#39;t have had. So uh we believe that it&#39;s uh that it&#39;s here. We believe that we&#39;ll see it. We believe that our products will be in a greater demand. Uh and certainly any incremental production volume over over the period of of the next few years is just going to make things that much better for us and for all suppliers because we all know that as volumes go up, suppliers do a whole lot better. And uh I think all of us have done a very good job of weathering the storm. We&#39;ve all managed, you know, nobody&#39;s sitting over in the corner whining about what&#39;s happened the last six years. We&#39;ve focused on what we can control. We&#39;ve managed our business. And I think the supply base uh is is strong as a result of it. But you know, we&#39;re not going to be able to absorb tariffs. We&#39;re not going to be able to uh absorb material economics. We&#39;re not going to be able to do those things. But but clearly we&#39;re going to be able to run our factories very efficiently. And we&#39;ll be able to provide great products uh and great services to our customers. And I think that that&#39;s proven for us to be the winner, right? We launch great, we execute well, and our customers continue to give us more business. They all vote with purchase orders, Tom. That&#39;s just how it works. Yeah. And and over the last two or three years, I mean, we&#39;re we&#39;re almost at record highs in terms of booking new business. So, we&#39;re really proud of that. Yeah. No, it&#39;s it&#39;s phenomenal. Um uh last last couple here and then we&#39;ll do a couple fun ones and wrap it up. As you return to double-digit margins and return on invested capital and continue to generate strong cash flows, you mentioned not only the expectation of having various options to manage upcoming debt and improve the cost of capital, but also the goal of reaching two times leverage by the end of 2027 without even contemplating a refi. Since there are no major refinancings needed till 2027 and a dimminimous 43 million in November 2026, uh do you need to do you need to address the capital structure this year? And assuming a bump in production from the front-loading production in March or the first quarter and a modest continued moderation in rates, is there a view to possibly wait for a credit upgrade or some other event before taking that action? That&#39;s a great question and and certainly you&#39;re right. We don&#39;t have an urgent requirement to deal with it right now. I I think if we if I would put a time frame on it and I had my magic wand, you know, sometime between this summer and and next year&#39;s first quarter uh would be ideal. And and why do I say that? because that that gives us an opportunity quarter by quarter to continue to put points on the scoreboard, continue to show the improvement is sustainable within the business, continue to improve the the EBDA and continue to improve the return on invested capital, continue to generate uh better cash flow and at the same time I I truly believe that the geopolitical environment uh in in turning down the the temperature of the world uh is going to occur during this same period of time and I also believe that we&#39;ll continue to see uh strong economic uh metrics that will allow the interest rates to continue to come down and at the same time you know you mentioned the two time two times leverage well you know that&#39;s a journey from where we are today to to two times but there&#39;s a couple other pretty important points along that journey right if we got to four times that&#39;s better than where we are today and that would result in in a significant improvement probably in in the rates that we would be able to to talk to the the institutions about and and certainly they they will have visibility uh into that that two times or better journey that we&#39;ve that we&#39;ve been very open openly discussing. Uh and and then as we&#39;ve discussed if that is is uh built on top of volume improvements then it&#39;s just going to make it that much that much better. But um I I think we&#39;ve done a really good job of getting ourselves in a position uh to to be able to be patient over the course of the next year or so uh and and and hopefully find ourselves in a better overall economic environment and then the company uh will have have probably to your point received an upgrade along that journey and then that might be the better time to to pull it and and I think that&#39;s that&#39;s probably how we&#39;re uh thinking about it. We certainly uh at the same time we don&#39;t want to to let the existing long-term debt become current debt either. So yeah, you know, there&#39;s an incentive on on both sides of this and and the relationships we have with the banks and and the ability to to do what we&#39;ve said we were going to do for all these uh many quarters and and many years I think will also help in the conversation. Yeah. And and I think what&#39;s implicit what I was getting to in English for our viewers and investors is uh implicit in that two times over time is is effectively the operating leverage in the business. This this thing as volumes normalize can print more money than the US Treasury. Uh you don&#39;t have to comment on that one. Uh the the last thing is on everyone&#39;s mind. If a good portion of your production is in Mexico due to the fact that that&#39;s where the OEM factories are and that&#39;s where they wanted you to be, uh, are you mostly shipping your products to the OEM plants in Mexico and not across the border? I.e., uh, as it stands, you wouldn&#39;t really be impacted by tariffs if that is the case. And how much impact do you expect from proposed tariffs if in fact they go through as advertised? and is uh uh if t\n\nthe company uh will have have probably to your point received an upgrade along that journey and then that might be the better time to to pull it and and I think that&#39;s that&#39;s probably how we&#39;re uh thinking about it. We certainly uh at the same time we don&#39;t want to to let the existing long-term debt become current debt either. So yeah, you know, there&#39;s an incentive on on both sides of this and and the relationships we have with the banks and and the ability to to do what we&#39;ve said we were going to do for all these uh many quarters and and many years I think will also help in the conversation. Yeah. And and I think what&#39;s implicit what I was getting to in English for our viewers and investors is uh implicit in that two times over time is is effectively the operating leverage in the business. This this thing as volumes normalize can print more money than the US Treasury. Uh you don&#39;t have to comment on that one. Uh the the last thing is on everyone&#39;s mind. If a good portion of your production is in Mexico due to the fact that that&#39;s where the OEM factories are and that&#39;s where they wanted you to be, uh, are you mostly shipping your products to the OEM plants in Mexico and not across the border? I.e., uh, as it stands, you wouldn&#39;t really be impacted by tariffs if that is the case. And how much impact do you expect from proposed tariffs if in fact they go through as advertised? and is uh uh if there is  any material exposure, how do you expect to manage it? Yeah. Well, we certainly do ship uh a lot of our product uh back across the border from Mexico. Uh a lot of it is used in Mexico as well. So, let&#39;s just say it&#39;s it&#39;s probably a little bit over half though that comes back uh at the request of our of our customers uh here in the US. Uh so, it&#39;s it&#39;s significant to us. Uh I think that&#39;s probably the good news that it&#39;s significant to us and it&#39;s significant to the entire industry. So it isn&#39;t a sustainable uh situation and and we obviously anticipate and so we&#39;ve been providing our customers all along with this information. So, it&#39;s not a surprise. Every single OEM that we&#39;re dealing with here in the United States, uh, is very aware of of what the impact would be to each and every supplier and and their vehicles as well. Uh, and they&#39;re having conversations with us about how do you deal with it? And so, uh, t\n\nhere is n't any way that that a supplier can deal with a 25% tariff on half the product that that's coming from from Mexico to the US. So in our case, like most uh there would have to be a a conversation and a and a way that the that the OEMs are going to absorb it uh in order for it to be u sustainable for the for the industry. But it's so large and and ultimately would all be passed on to the consumer at the end of the day. And that gets into that conversation you and I had about wow then you would be really destroying value. This this isn't sustainable. it doesn't work even for a minute uh let alone a month. Uh so I'm hoping that between now and April 2nd uh this gets figured out and and uh we don't have this distraction as an industry uh to deal with because it wouldn't be fun. Yeah, makes makes perfect sense. Um since I know Cooper Standard is is doing a lot with AI these days. Uh the final two bonus\n\nwhen Nvidia was trading at $152, uh everyone said, \"What are you doing for AI?\" I said, \"I'm doing this company called Commtock Resources. They they're a natural gas play and it was $8 and change. Now it's up close to $20.\" And then people were like, \"No, really? What are you doing about AI?\" I was like, \"Well, I'm doing this thing called Alibaba. It was under well under a hundred bucks. Now it's 145 going to 200. It may be that Cooper Standard is going to be the AI play of 2025 with everything going on. But leaving that aside, here's the first question from Grock. Uh suggested that I ask you. Again, all of this is opinion, not advice. This is not recommendations. Talk to your financial advisor. This is not guidance. This is a conversation. Uh so here's what Grock says. Jeff, if you were an investor or or if if you were an investor with $1 million to deploy, why would you put it all into Cooper Standard stock right now? Now, we would never recommend anyone puts 100% of anything into one stock, but uh but that's the question. So, give us uh some guidelines here, Jeff. Yeah, as I mentioned in the conversation, Tom, I mean, because we've taken care of our own business, right? We've over the last 5 years, we've established a cost base that allows the company to flourish. Uh we've already put enough points on the scoreboard to tell you that by the end of 2025, we're going to be at double digit EBDA and we're going to be at double digit return on invested capital. And then when we forecast and just look out a few years from that point, uh we've said that our net leverage is going to be uh two times or less. All of those statements are on the volumes that exist today and a very slight increase in forecast over the course of the next three years. Uh so if I would look at that and and I would be an investor, I would say, \"Wow, there's a company that's delivering results. There's a company that that has uh told us that the that they're going to return to the type of prosperity that they exist that existed back in the 2017 period of time that you mentioned earlier was $140 stock price. I'm not predicting that. I'm just telling you that I I know what that feels like and I know what it feels like today and I know what the industry pent up demand is for the next three or four years. So with that, uh, it's pretty tough to find, I think, a company in an industry that's better positioned than than what we are. Love it. And, uh, this one is is also from Grock, and it's interesting that they mentioned Warren Buffett because, uh, I look up to him a lot. A lot of our framework is similar. Uh, if you had to pitch Cooper Standard to Warren Buffett, what's the number one metric you'd want to prove this is a cash machine worth owning? I think we talked about this. Uh I own over 350,000 shares of Cooper Standard stock. Uh that's about 2% of the company. Uh so that's I think putting my uh money where my mouth is. And it also uh for me is probably the most important metric. And I I can I could talk to you about all the other company metrics, but I'll just stick to that personal one. I love it. I love it. And final question, Jeff, is there anything else we didn't cover that you'd like to share with our audience of investors today? I think we've covered it all. I just I'm I'm excited about the future. I'm excited about Cooper Standard. I mean, we have great employees. We've talked a lot about our product. We haven't talked much about our culture today. But it isn't just the what we make, it's how we do it. And and I'm so proud of the uh of the 21,000 employees that call this home. And we don't have a lot of turnover. Uh we have great people. It's not the sign on the building that makes us Tom. It's the people within the buildings. And and I'm really proud of that fact. So that's how I would end it. Thank you very much for the conversation. Well, well, thank you so much for joining us. Very grateful for you taking the time. That's chairman and CEO of Cooper Standard, Jeff Edwards.\n\n### MEDIA_APPEARANCE_RECAP\nmoving along , want to thank Jake Mack and Taylor Riggs for having me on the Clayman Countdown Fox Business. This week, we got to discuss, uh, two of my favorite companies, Alibaba and Lip Booan for Intel. Listen in here. But are markets, at least today, looking through the data and focusing on the fundamentals of some of these companies, which do indeed remain strong. Joining us now, I&#39;m pleased to say, region&#39;s chief investment officer Alan Mcnite and Great Hill Capital Chairman Thomas Hayes.\n### QUOTES_OF_THE_WEEK\nWell, Taylor, I think Warren Buffett said it best. Be greedy when others are fearful. And every single fear indicator is completely washed out. The AI sentiment showed just 19% of retail investors were bullish last week. They bought record puts after the market was down. you want to buy that house insurance before the fire. Uh and hedge funds were record selling stocks in the hole. These are all contrarian indicators and this is when we look for opportunities. We&#39;re seeing the Fed put back in play for June. 82% chance of a cut in June.\n### MISCELLANEOUS\nAnd we&#39;re seeing utilities and AI play still. It is. And I think that&#39;s where utilities is now a growth name. And if you had told me 10 years ago I would buy utilities for the growth, I would have said you&#39;re crazy. But today you look at the type of growth they can generate because of data center growth, because of AI that is fueling that data center growth. And suddenly you&#39;re really seeing an opportunity there, particularly in the southeast part of the country where you&#39;re seeing continued population demand as well.\n### FEATURED_COMPANY_DEEP_DIVES\nTom, um I&#39;m not calling you crazy, but a lot of people might call you crazy when I look and one of your top picks right now is Intel. This is a great storied American company. They just announced, I believe on Friday, a new CEO, but this is a company that has struggled. Why Intel? And why Intel at $25? Well, Taylor Lip Bhutan is the new CEO. He came from Cadence Designs when the stock was down 86% in 2009. If you had invested $1 million when he became CEO, by the time he stepped down 14 years later in 2023, that $1 million became $68 million. Lip Bhutan is a miracle worker and Intel needs a miracle and I think they&#39;re going to get it. You know, the key thing\n\n### MEDIA_APPEARANCE_RECAP\nlast week were getting a little nervous like, \"Oh my gosh, is the bottom here? Is there more room to run?\" But on the other hand, people are like, \"Look, everything is 10% on sale now. And if I liked a sweater at 100, I like it even more at 90.\" we still think communication services, we think utilities look cheap here, and it's all about the earnings. And I think we're going to see as we get into first quarter earning season, if you can continue to buy companies that are delivering earnings in excess of 10 15% growth, it pays to go shopping when things are on sale. And we're seeing utilities and AI play still. And I think that's where utilities is now a growth name. And if you had told me 10 years ago I would buy utilities for the growth, I would have said you're crazy. But today you look at the type of growth they can generate because of data center growth, because of AI that is fueling that data center growth. And suddenly you're really seeing an opportunity there, particularly in the southeast part of the country where you're seeing continued population demand as well.\n### FEATURED_COMPANY_DEEP_DIVES\nI look and one of your top picks right now is Intel. This is a great storied American company. They just announced, I believe on Friday, a new CEO, but this is a company that has struggled. Why Intel? And why Intel at $25? Well, Taylor Lip Bhutan is the new CEO. He came from Cadence Designs when the stock was down 86% in 2009. If you had invested $1 million when he became CEO, by the time he stepped down 14 years later in 2023, that $1 million became $68 million. Lip Bhutan is a miracle worker and Intel needs a miracle and I think they're going to get it. You know, the key thing here is\n\n### FEATURED_COMPANY_DEEP_DIVES\nNvidia&#39;s growth rate has decelerated, not for lack of demand, but for lack of supply. TSMC is at capacity. Intel in the background has been building up the fabs. They&#39;re ready for prime time. Nvidia&#39;s testing chips. Broadcom is testing chips. And Lip Bhutan is going to spike the football in the end zone. We&#39;re very excited about Intel. And it&#39;s trading just a couple bucks over tangible book value. So, if they liquidated the whole company today, you get most of your money back. And if he does what he could do, which we know he can, it could be a double and beyond in the next 12 to 24 months. But Tom, a lot of people are thinking that Intel I mean I&#39;ve heard um you know not rumors but you know words used like they&#39;re selling the car for parts, right? Where you had rumors about Broadcom, TSMC coming and looking at different portions of the business. Do you like it as a sum of the whole or do you like it as different parts? Look, if they sell it off for parts, we probably get 3540 bucks when all is said and done. Lit Bhutan has stated he&#39;s going to run this business. He&#39;s not interested in a fire sale. He&#39;s going to turn this into a multibagger. Everything is there. Actually, Gellzinger did lay the found foundry uh uh framework to move ahead and to supply the Nvidia and the Broadcoms of the world. Lip Bhan is going to finish that execution at the five yard line, take it in for a touchdown. This is going to be, look, it was on no one&#39;s bingo card at the beginning of this year that Nvidia would be among the worst chip producers this year in terms of performers. And Intel is now the top performing semiconductor company for year-to- date 2025. Okay. I think people might say that says more about Nvidia than it does about Intel. We&#39;ll see. But Tom, I do like the bull call. \n\nYeah, I look, we continue to like China and people said we were crazy when we were buying Alibaba in the 90s, in the 80s, in the 60s. Now it&#39;s over 145, going to over 200 over the next 12 to 24 months. I&#39;m telling you, Intel is going to be the exact same way, Taylor. They&#39;re calling me crazy now. when it&#39;s at 40 50 60 they&#39;re gonna say wow you know it&#39;s is it time to buy at 60 and I&#39;m gonna say yeah it&#39;s probably going higher lip banan is a miracle worker why don&#39;t we make crazy good again sometimes my husband calls me a little crazy and look I didn&#39;t turn out so bad so maybe a little crazy isn&#39;t so bad really appreciate both of you Alan Mcnite and Thomas Hayes please come back and join me thank you Taylor mean and we&#39;re back and then I got to join uh uh two incredible, well, three incredible people on the Money Show podcast this week. I want to thank Mike Larson for having me on. As always, my buddy Kenny Pulcari and Jim Bianco, who is a bond expert uh and macroeconomic expert was great to be on with the three of them.\n\n### MEDIA_APPEARANCE_RECAP\nWell, I think this is pretty standard, Mike. This is what we see pretty much every four years, uh, post-election year. You see some weakness in February through mid-Marchch and then you start to find a bottom. And why why is that pretty uniform going back, you know, hundred something years is because uh people want to get a sense of what the policy is. And it doesn&#39;t have to be good policy. It just needs to be known policy. And I think that&#39;s what we&#39;re grappling with uh with Trump right now. But I like I I say to many people, welcome to Trump 2.0. Same as Trump 1.0. New day, new headline, new tweet, new volatility resolves higher over time. Uh and what I like what we saw last week is uh a big flush out. You know, record selling by hedge funds. Uh that&#39;s a contrarian indicator. Uh a lot of momentum followers there. Overlever retail uh investors bought record insurance, record put buying after the house was already burned down. You want to buy those insurance premiums before the fire starts. Uh so you can&#39;t make that up. Then you had the largest drop in US equity allocation on record in the Bank of America fund manager survey. uh which we saw this week. So I I think I think we&#39;re finding a a situation where we can go in and buy stocks. Uh as for the MAG 7, you know, at your events towards the end of the year, I was saying the theme was going to be a shift out of the Mag 7 into the unmagnificent 493 and more importantly into into international. That&#39;s played out uh as anticipated. We think that theme will continue. And Mag 7, you got to look at two things. Number one, one thing no one&#39;s paying attention to that I&#39;ve seen is the Japanese carry trade unwind. Okay? And all you need to do is look at 10-year JGBs and what you see what used to be free hot money now has a cost. 10-year JGB yields are at 20ear highs. Those have continued to creep up aggressively in the last four weeks. And as a result, the most impacted part of the market has been the MAG 7 where all that hot money has been parked. So, I do think that yes, we are due for a technical bounce. Uh, maybe MAG 7 will trade back up to the top of the range, but I think the theme for 2025 will continue. MAG 7 will underperform relative to 493 and dramatically underperform relative to international as we&#39;ve seen. Y, thanks Tom. Let me a little bit. I mean, you&#39;ve talked international, you mentioned Alibaba. Is there anything else that that particularly excites you now? I know you&#39;ve talked about some names at our past events, but we&#39;re getting towards the end of Q1, so I figured I&#39;d uh I&#39;d see if there&#39;s anything new that&#39;s on your radar screen. Look, I I think uh Intel is the most underrated story. If they liquidated the whole damn thing today, you&#39;d probably get about 22 23 bucks. It&#39;s trading at 25. Lip Banan uh was at Cadence Designs, which makes the software for all of these chip designers. Lip Bhutan became CEO of Cadence Designs in January 2009 after the stock was down 86%. If you&#39;d put a million dollars with this guy, uh by the time he stepped down as executive chairman 14 years later in 2023, that $1 million became $68 million. 68 bagger. This guy is a miracle worker. Intel needs a miracle. he&#39;s going to deliver and he&#39;s not interested in partnerships or selling it off for parts. He&#39;s going to run this thing up the flag pole. And here&#39;s the thing, Nvidia is not down because of lack of demand. Nvidia is down because of lack of supply. TSMC is at capacity and only gives them $4 billion of revenue growth per quarter, which on a bigger base decelerates the revenue growth from 250% down to probably 30 40% by the end of this year. They need capacity. TSMC could say, &quot;Yes, Mr. Trump, we&#39;re going to invest a trillion dollars in the United States.&quot; The problem is it&#39;s going to take them four to five years to get to where Intel is with their fabs today. So, love Gellzinger or hate him, he did one thing over the last four years. He set Intel up for success. And Lip Bhan is going to come in and spike the football in the end zone as uh these this chip production comes on on board. Right now, Nvidia and Broadcom are testing their chip in Intel&#39;s US fabs. And from what we have gotten back through media, it&#39;s going quite well. This game is just be beginning for Intel for everyone saying, &quot;Oh, Intel&#39;s going out of business.&quot; I mean, give me a break. They&#39;ve done over $50 billion of revenue in the last 12 months being completely mismanaged. And now you got someone who can who can ride this horse to the promised land, and we&#39;re getting on with them. Yeah. As an old school person, you know, all I can do is reminisce about the Winel days, right? Why we only have a couple minutes left. I want to make sure just for anybody watching, uh Jim is going to be joining us in Dallas and Miami. Uh Tom and Kenny are going to be joining us at the Miami Symposium in May. Guys, if you have maybe 30 45 seconds to just give a preview preview of what you you think you&#39;re going to be talking about. Tom, maybe I&#39;ll go to you first and uh let you do that now. Yeah. I think one of my segments is going to be how the uninvestable became investable while we were building up our Baba position. and everyone said it&#39;s uninvestable. It&#39;s uninvestable. It&#39;s uninvestable. We&#39;re going to talk about kind of market sentiment that goes into that, how you can see through the noise, look under the cover, uh follow the fundamentals. In the short term, the market is a voting machine based on emotions like you saw in the last two years in China. In the long term, it&#39;s a weighing machine based on fundamentals like you&#39;re seeing right now. Uh and then we&#39;re going to talk about some uh in the second segment, some year-end picks, year-end outlook. A lot of opportunities to make money in the second half of this year. So, we&#39;re really excited to go down to Miami and deliver a lot of value.\n\n### MISCELLANEOUS\nAnd we&#39;re back. And uh and this is the event that Mike and I referenced in the Money Show interview. I&#39;ll be speaking at the Money Show in Miami. The event is from the 15th through the 17th. My two segments are on Saturday the 17th before I fly to go see my friends in Dubai. Uh looking forward to that. So you can register either at the money show website miamimmms.com or go to hedge funips.com and just put Miami in the search bar and this will come up and you can register there. Uh then I had a chance to join Diego on um CGTN America. Want to thank Diego and Chamellia Kilawan for having me on. This was about Tesla and Elon Musk. You can go ahead and watch that at hedgefundtips.com. And I want to thank Yahoo Naomi Buchanan for including me in her in her article on Yahoo Finance about the carry trade. And now our\n\n### MEDIA_APPEARANCE_RECAP\nI think one of my segments is going to be how the uninvestable became investable while we were building up our Baba position. and everyone said it's uninvestable. It's uninvestable. It's uninvestable. We're going to talk about kind of market sentiment that goes into that, how you can see through the noise, look under the cover, uh follow the fundamentals. In the short term, the market is a voting machine based on emotions like you saw in the last two years in China. In the long term, it's a weighing machine based on fundamentals like you're seeing right now.\n\n### QUOTES_OF_THE_WEEK\nwe've just had an exciting period of time between what's going on with uh Alibaba and some of the others. And you know, it's interesting as it relates to Cooper Standard and I had a number of comments, you know, uh today like the they really enjoyed the uh CEO interview and and everything else. And I said, \"Look, you know, $2 down or $2 up really doesn't matter. The key is how we're positioned for the long-term story.\" And Cooper Standard couldn't be better positioned. And nothing has changed either really in the information, although the information's gotten a little bit better than our original thesis than um than when we originally got involved in May of 2022. It's just now all the things that we said were going to happen when no one believed it are now starting to happen and people are starting to get excited. And I think it's it's literally the early days of the early days. And when this thing turns, it turns all at once just like we saw with Alibaba. It takes years then it happens all at once just like we saw with many many others throughout the years of this podcast. So this is a very important thing.\n\nIt takes years then it happens all at once just like we saw with Alibaba. So this is a very important thing. We know what we own, not getting deterred by short-term noise, whether it&#39;s $5 up or $5 down is completely immaterial. I can assure you uh with Cooper Standard, we are nowhere near that price. \n### MACRO_DATA_SLIDES\nFirst and foremost average S&P returns following 21 corrections of 10% since 1980. So when there has been no recession was which was 14 out of the 21 times which we believe this will be the case this time. Uh 12 months later you&#39;re up 11% on average.\n\nFirst and foremost average S&P returns following 21 corrections of 10% since 1980. So when there has been no recession was which was 14 out of the 21 times which we believe this will be the case this time. Uh 12 months later you&#39;re up 11% on average. And then want to cover some of the\n\n### MACRO_DATA_SLIDES\nI think we&#39;ve actually run out of sellers in the short term, which is why couple weeks ago on Vney, I put myself on a limb. I said we&#39;d be much higher a few weeks out. I think that&#39;s going to be the case. If it&#39;s not already the case, I don&#39;t know if we&#39;re higher yet, but I think we&#39;ll be much higher by the end of the month, uh, as it relates to where we were on that segment. By the way, I&#39;ll be on Vanney tomorrow morning at 10 a.m. Eastern. So, check that out. Very excited. Thank you, Christian Dagger. Um, this is the average path of the S&amp;P you during years 1 and two of the election cycle since 1928. We&#39;ve talked about this every week, which is why we told you in the beginning of February, buckle up, buttercup, and get your shopping list ready. And that&#39;s exactly what happened. Um, here&#39;s the blue line here. So, eight weeks in, that&#39;s beginning of February. And then through the end of March, you get another checkback retest, which probably what we&#39;re going through right now, and then straight up into the summer, and then some weakness in the end of the year. So, I think that the people um you know, we talked about last week, by the way, uh we&#39;re going to be opening up for the small accounts on uh April 1st and uh that you could get in the queue and start to get your paperwork going and get your uh account approved by Interactive Brokers so that on April 1st when we&#39;re open, you can fund and we can start to allocate. Not that you kind of missed this whole thing here uh uh waiting and a lot of you have jumped on that. So excited to get you guys in. Um you can fund before the first but we&#39;ll start to put the money to work for you on April 1st. And for those of you who are thinking about coming in uh we&#39;ll be open for a few weeks and then we&#39;ll close it out for Q2 for the small accounts. uh normal size accounts of the uh by the way our minimum is 1 million and for normalsiz accounts of 5 million uh there are no cuto offs you can come in whenever you want there&#39;s bes bespoke service at that level and then after this massive amount of money can be made in the first year uh then it starts to get you know we&#39;ll be harvesting profits at at full value finding some shorts and uh getting prepared for the year two of the midcycle correction which can be a bit more bumpier here and we love those type of years as well. But, uh, this is where easy money can be made if you&#39;re positioned right. Uh, S&amp;P and NASDAQ 100 again seems to be wanting to put in some bottoms here. Maybe we&#39;ll retest before we go higher, but uh, you know, you can see the equal weight. And by the way, if you&#39;re listening to this on audio, that&#39;s super. Keep listening. But if you can from time to time tune in on YouTube and watch and of course like and comment. That&#39;s what keeps this thing going. The more you like and the more you comment, the more they&#39;re going to serve it up to people when they log into YouTube, which will give us more and more people watching, which will make us want to do this more and more for uh both clients and non-clients alike. We will always do something like this for clients. Uh but for non-clients who have been on the free ride money train uh pay you know do your part and um uh like subscribe comment and uh and let&#39;s keep doing this for a long time. Uh all right Europe rocking and rolling here as we talked about international versus the US that&#39;s been a huge theme coming into the year. Uh even UK Germany started to rally on big stimulus that they announced. Hang Sang has been the, you know, Chinese equity&#39;s biggest performer from uninvestable to investable. All the folks who were downgrading when Baba was 70 are now upgrading at 140. Just the beginning, ladies and gentlemen, as we flip them all over. Japan struggling. I think that&#39;s going to persist because we&#39;ve talked about the carry trade. Uh they have to continue to raise rates after printing money for three decades as inflation kicks in. So that will be uh continued pressure on the reversing the carry trade on the MAG 7 on all the hot money stocks on all the shiny objects that uh people chase that are now getting smashed and these are the people that come up to me and say when will the pain stop? I&#39;m like what pain? We we don&#39;t own any mag 7. We sold all those in July of last year after buying them in in October and November 2022. Um so here&#39;s 10-year yield continues to roll over. I think this is going to go down to the low end of the range. This got up to 480. Complete fake out and I said we were going to see a three handle before we saw a five handle. Everyone was so convinced it was going to five. Not going to be the case. Um so we&#39;ll probably get another fake out here, maybe back up to 450 before we go lower. But um the trend is your friend. Dollar absolutely collapsing after the election. It took off, faked everyone out. We said, &quot;Guys, after the after the inauguration, watch out below.&quot; And here we go. This has a lot further to fall. That&#39;s also good for even the Looney is getting a bounce now. Uh so that&#39;s a good thing. You&#39;ve got some new leadership there. Not sure it&#39;s better than the old leadership, but uh it&#39;s new and at least someone someone that we can talk to and uh get back to a mutually beneficial uh agreement. Uh WTI crude. Look, if all else fails, Wayne Gretzky will run the 51st state and it&#39;ll be absolutely incredible. So, uh, all right, there. There we go. I just lost all my Canadian viewers. Uh, WTI crude oil, it&#39;s in this range. I think this is going to probably resolve higher and some of the oil stocks are going to go with it. Uh, we continue to like our com stock resource, which we bought much lower. Um, uh, WTI crude. So yeah, again, I just not finding anything in oil and gas that makes me super excited, but they&#39;re all going to go up marginally. And when I say marginally, they&#39;re not going to be doubles and triples other than what we have with Commtock. They&#39;re going to be, you know, 30 50% and I just won&#39;t risk capital for for anemic returns like that. Um, copper, this is uh doc Dr. Copper has a PhD in economics. That&#39;s a leading indicator for global growth, which tells you that China&#39;s coming back. uh which we know from Alibaba, our largest position, which has fortunately gone straight up this year, which is exciting. Higher highs, higher lows. Um looks like some of these semis want to bounce. PayPal. God, I love it here. Every new dollar that comes in, we&#39;re we&#39;ve been able to uh pick up some PayPal. We&#39;ll be picking up some more VF Corp. all these incredible companies that we&#39;re excited about. Um, Generrack even has come into a point where it actually add even though we bought well below 100. Uh, I&#39;d love to add more at these levels. Pretty excited about that. Uh, and what else do we have here? I think that&#39;s pretty much it. So, that&#39;s Robert\n\n### TECHNICAL_CHARTS\nWTI crude oil, it&#39;s in this range.

So you can see here from 2021 till now even in the most difficult operating environment now that they've got the governmental tailwinds behind them the AI tailwinds and all the other amazing things toll taker with domestic consumption uh as a focus of the government they're just going to mint money and like as I like to say print more bills than the US Treasury. Uh Alibaba's capex is going up. They've they've got 80 billion of cash. That's a good thing for them to do to just box out the other people and gain more and more share. China unveils plan to vigorously boost weak consumption. Vigorously boost. Uh so they're putting their money where their mouth is. Uh that is their game plan. They used to build bridges to nowhere and empty cities. Now they're going to get people to spend because they want to be like America. And Alibaba is the number one toll taker for the middle and upper class spending in China. And that's the spending that matters. Uh like everyone where else in the world, the top 10 or 20% make up the vast majority of the spending and that's where Alibaba thrives. Teimu sells garbage at the low end, which did okay for a couple years when they were in lockdown and everyone felt poor, but as things recover, uh Alibaba is going to whip their butts. China banks cut consumer loan rates to record low to spur demand. Hong Kong stocks hit three-year highs on Trump talks could ease trade trade tensions. So Trump is going to be having a meeting with Xi. Um maybe sooner than June, but it definitely looks like June. Uh Alibaba and other Chinese stocks are crushing US shares. Here's why.

Intel is the best chip stock this year in a surprising reversal. I went on Charles Payne last year when Nvidia was $153 and I said to sell Nvidia and buy Intel and after that he didn&#39;t invite me on the show for three months. Dell CEO explains why he thinks the PC refresh cycle is starting. That&#39;s who who&#39;s the number one beneficiary of the P PC refresh uh uh is Intel.

That&#39;s who who&#39;s the number one beneficiary of the P PC refresh uh uh is Intel um the handsdown leader in inferior chips. uh BFA survey shows biggest ever drop in US stock allocation. So all these managers selling in the hole. Why lowering the yield on the 10-year bonds is more important to Trump than the stock market or interest rates. This is the critical thing. All mortgages are tied to the 10-year Treasury yield. Uh so if he brings that down, number one, he can refinance the US debt at a lower rate. Number two, he can spur house buying, auto buying, everything. Get the game going, get nominal growth cranking so that debt as a percentage of GDP goes down. Uh even if the actual debt in dollars does not uh and uh Bessant was out talking a little bit about that this week, uh about a way that they&#39;re going to lower the 10-year yield by another 30 basis points, and it has to do with the supplementary leverage ratio at banks. If that is removed, uh, it&#39;ll automatically drop 30 basis points to the 10-year yield. Each basis point is worth a billion dollars a year in interest payments. So, uh, that is a good thing, not a bad thing. And they are all over that. So, when I talked about a three handle before a five handle, I wasn&#39;t joking. And now we&#39;ve got an administration that is deadly focused on it. Confidence in German economy surges as parliament approves huge spending plan. Boeing sees cash flow improve as jet factories stabilized. That had a nice move this week. Crown Castle finally completed the sale of the fiber business. The stock shot up. Uh that was great.

Building products. This is huge news this week with uh Brad Jacobs over at QXO. He finally clinched a deal for Beacon Roofing. So he now has his platform company and this is where he will be able to work his magic as he has so many times in the past. Whether it was Waste Connections selling to Waste Management, Multibagger uh in the late 80s or early 90s, whether it was United Rentals when he got involved in 1997, if you'd put up a million dollars with him, it it's now worth $74 million. 74 Bagger. And uh XPO Logistics, if he if you had invested side by side with him, he came in 2011, he invested $150 million of his own money. uh and it was a 160 bagger that if you had uh invested $1 million you'd have 160 million and uh right now QXO he didn't invest 151 150 of his own money he's got so much conviction in this business plan he's put over a billion dollars of his own cash uh which is material and um and we're invested alongside of him so kudos to all of my investors who are now able to uh participate in that and um and the game is just beginning. So, we'll look for any opportunities to add more and take advantage because this is one that you just buy, close your eyes, and in 5 years you have a multibagger.\n\n### FEATURED_COMPANY_DEEP_DIVES\ndollars of his own cash uh which is material and um and we're invested alongside of him so kudos to all of my investors who are now able to uh participate in that and um and the game is just beginning. So, we'll look for any opportunities to add more and take advantage because this is one that you just buy, close your eyes, and in 5 years you have a multibagger. I think this thing's going to be probably the calculations I did when we got involved uh sometime back at around I don't know when let's see when was it I think our base is around $11. I can't find the mouse for the other computer. I think it was 1176 but I'm cuffing that. But um I think the calculation I have internally is like an 8 to10 bagger over a decade. So I think I was looking at like an 80 to $100 stock. So um we'll see as the facts change we could change our mind. Usually with Brad the facts get better as time goes on. So it could be a lot better. So but that's one you just sit there and let him work his magic. No one has created more wealth for shareholders than Brad Jacobs repeatedly over time. Certainly Buffett has created fortunes for people, but that was a one-trick pony. Uh, and a great pony, don't get me wrong, probably the best pony in the world. But, uh, Brad keeps doing it over and over, and I love the timing, and I love the play, and I love the fragmentation, and I see what he sees. And then he has this magic touch where he not only does good economic accretive uh acquisitions, but uh he finds a way to put in innovative technologies to really juice the margins and really get efficiency out of and uh uniformity out of all the acquisitions and that just drops huge amounts of cash to the owners. And uh and that's all he wakes up thinking about every single day. If you've read his books and you've listened to him and you've seen what he's done for shareholders over the years, we're super excited about that and um and glad he finally  got that done. Uh and that's what happens. Winners win and Brad Jacobs is a winner. \n### HEADLINES_AND_NEWS\nSo, uh US natural gas prices up on record flows to LG export plants. Cooler weather forecast.

This just gives the background of the thesis when we came out with it publicly in 2022. uh what we were saying then and some of our past articles about it which you can find all at hedge funfundtips.com and then the Bank of America fund manager survey came out this week and we put out the summary here are the top five points largest pullback in sentiment since March of 2020 the bottom of the COVID lows people are more pessimistic than then uh which was unbelievable buying opportunity number two record rotation out of US stocks falling to a net 23% underweight.

And these guys were the ones that were most overweight mag 7 and pounding the table at the top with all the shiny objects and um and that's the way it goes. Record rotation out of US stocks.

Uh, China rolled out an action plan for boosting consumption, which might be the Chinese equivalent of quote doing whatever it takes. If you remember during the European debt crisis in 2011, Draghy came out and said we'll do whatever it takes and squeezed all of the shorts and completely destroyed the bond vigilantes.

So, expect them to bring in the share account to invest in more uh capex light towers like their 40,000 leg legacy which are cash machines and the stock goes up. So, those of you who listened and locked in the seven or eight% dividend yield now are going to see uh from those levels probably doubles over the next few years on top of collecting 7% a year, which is uh great. Okay. And uh\n### FEATURED_COMPANY_DEEP_DIVES\nmoving along , we've got uh oh yeah, I want to cover ASOS real quick. You can read all that stuff on your own. Okay, so ASOS, while this has been a tiny position for us, we've consistently been on alert for new information that would warrant making it at least a half-sized position or even a full-size position. We have yet to be impressed. Our instincts about whether a quote consultant could make a good CEO have thus far been proven correct. A lot of talk and not enough action. We hope we are proven wrong and will upsize if he starts to deliver. We do believe this is an incredible business that has huge upside potential. We don't know if they have the right leader in place or not. Uh you know, free cash flow is certainly starting to improve. That's a positive thing. He hasn't turned revenues yet. He has a strategy for that. We shall see it. you know, I'd really rather have a guy like Bracken who has experience with brands, uh, a lot of expertise in doing that. But, uh, this one, you know, takes a little time. I think they're in a decent enough position. They've got a decent enough runway. It'll be good. And, uh, at any week we could be getting on and saying, \"Okay, I see the light at the end of the tunnel. Let's make it a real position.\" But, we're just simply not there yet. Uh, I'm very skeptical about this. I I have been, but we very rarely ever do a mini position. It's either going to be a full position or it's going to be nothing. But this one had all the makings of a perfect turnaround situation. I still think it does. I hope this guy can execute on it. If he can't, I think there's plenty of runway they could get someone else in there that who who can. Uh but there's no reason yet to make it a real position. And uh we'll leave it at that. Um,\n### MISCELLANEOUS\nokay. Congratulations to all the new clients that came in through our during our 2024 and Q1 2025 raises. You could not be better positioned for what we believe will continue to be a highly rewarding year in 2025. Not many people can say that this year, which is surprise, which is surprising to us because it was pretty clear what you had to do coming into 2025, which we told every single week. Lighten up on Mag 7. I mean, we we sounded like a broken record. Um producers would be like again the same message international. Yeah, again the same message.

So again, we're still in sandbagger season where they take estimates down the first quarter and then they beat all year and take them up. 2026 estimates have not come down surprisingly. So it's all backend loaded as it is every year. Same thing with Staples. Same exact story. That just creates opportunity for people like us. um and you and uh let's see if there's any major stuff that we wanted to cover here as it relates to economic data.

The rest of you will see you next week. Uh, Griffin Brown asks, &quot;As a recent college grad grad, what do you recommend? I look at read on a daily basis to stay update to date. Uh, don&#39;t have money for tons of subscriptions. Still feel like I&#39;m out of the loop.&quot; Uh, blah blah blah. Very fortunate family friend. Okay, so uh, Griffin number one, I mean the first of all the basics. Wall Street Journal, Bloomberg, CNBC, Barrens, for sure. Barren is the best financial publication out there. Um, and the most important thing you want to be reading, the best thing I would suggest to you is, um, first off, read the book, The Intelligent Investor by Ben Graham. Uh, second thing is you want to be reading annual reports. You should you should read one annual report per day or per week. I mean 50 in a year is pretty good. Get to know maybe the top 50 weights maybe the top maybe just a Dow 30 if you read the annual reports of all those that would pre be pretty valuable in a half a year and then start to work your way down as you find companies you&#39;re interested in. Just start to learn businesses. Um you could read the value line sheets to learn you know maybe five businesses a day in a cursory way. So then you can say oh out of these five businesses I really like uh you know whatever it happens to be and then you pull their annual report and that&#39;s one of your 50.

Uh that&#39;s the most important thing as far as the noise in the headlines\n\nthe way you&#39;re going to make money if you&#39;re trying to do uh get into the business is to learn companies and uh and be ready to act when their price gets dislocated. And that&#39;s what we do here. So Lee Foster, how do you go about waiting your portfolio? Do you have a scoring system? Struggle with balance allocation. Yeah, that&#39;s kind of special sauce for my clients, but um the higher conviction, the bigger the weight uh is is part of it. But um we also recognize that we have a repeatable framework. What we can control is how we analyze the financials. What we can&#39;t control is the timing in which price confirms the underlying strength of the business or the intrinsic value of the business. So that&#39;s why we&#39;ll have 8 to 12 companies because some are going to get to intrinsic value and beyond much faster than we ever anticipated in less than a year. Uh and some take longer than we anticipated, you know, 3 to 5 year range. Uh and they balance out by doing that. So um so it&#39;s a combination and then there&#39;s like 20 years of experience that goes into it. Like why would I have the instinct when ASOS is fundamentals for instance? um passed through my screen. It was a little bit hairy, but why would I have the instinct to make it such a small position is because I I was very uncomfortable with the CEO and watching him talk. He&#39;s fine. He believes he believes in what he&#39;s doing. I mean, he&#39;s not trying to pull one over, but I I I&#39;ve just met these like uh these consultant types, he he&#39;s probably done his part for what he can do in terms of the easy stuff, but the next phase is probably going to require someone else. Um for us to size into it is is my guess. Um, but that that just comes from experience and seeing the types of CEOs that are full of and seeing the type of CEOs that actually get stuff done. Brad Jacobs is the exact opposite end of the of the spectrum. Little talk, lots of action, huge focuses on what&#39;s ma matters. He creates shareholder value and the rest takes care of itself. Delights his customers uh versus uh try to sound cute at investor day meetings. So um uh that that&#39;s what I would say about that. It&#39;s experience. Uh many thanks for the great work. Also great work on the interview. What do you think about forvia? Aren&#39;t the fundamentals better than Cooper Standard? All right, let&#39;s see. So these are all the people who missed Cooper Standard and didn&#39;t want to get in with us when it was at five bucks. So now they&#39;re trying to find things that are quote unquote better to catch up. So, uh, number one, this is a French company, I guess, which is probably an immediate no for me. Um, FR, unless it&#39;s LVMH, VI A. I can&#39;t find this. Uh gross margin. Let&#39;s just see here. Here we go. Description. sells techn automotive technology solutions, seating, clean mobility, electronics, lighting, vehicle seats, exhaust systems for fuel cell ccentric vehicles. No one gives a about fuel cell ccentric vehicles. Um, display technologies All right, let&#39;s take a look at the financials. It seems like it&#39;s generally okay. All right. Financial analysis return on invested capital. free cash flow. Let&#39;s take a look at the balance sheet. $10 billion of debt, five billion of cash. income statement. Why is there so much dilution here? I I hate this. They&#39;ve almost doubled their share. I mean, not their share counts up 70%. If the financials were good, I I don&#39;t like this. This this is, by the way, this is what angers me about the ASOS CEO. He deluded shareholders by about 20% because he couldn&#39;t think creatively and get the job done. So, I I hate CEOs that do this kind of stuff. So, for me, the fundamentals are great. This is So, uh, not for me. And I emphasized that on the call with Jeff and acknowledged him because if anyone should have diluted the shareholders or or almost had to during the crisis in COVID, it was him and he did not do it. Why? Because he&#39;s a partner. He owns 350,000 shares, 2% of the company. That is material. And that&#39;s why they don&#39;t screw us because they would be screwing themselves. My guess is if you look at management ownership here, uh either part of the delusion is them giving themselves all these shares. Forget it. This is a French scam. Not interested. I don&#39;t care how good the fundamentals look. When you screw the shareholders like this, go to hell. Next.\n### ASK_ME_ANYTHING_QA\nMicah Kelsey, your podcast is incredible. I listen to every uh video cast right when it drops on Thursday nights. Well, thank you very much. Appreciate that. Micah. Uh, the interview with CPS was excellent. Okay, so he&#39;s asking why doesn&#39;t he own more stock? I mean, the guy personally owns 350,000 shares. We own a lot lot lot more than that, but um, you know, he&#39;s one guy. I mean, he&#39;ll he&#39;s going to make I mean, if he does this right, the guy&#39;s going to make personally. I mean, he could make uh 35 to $70 million if he does it right. So, uh I don&#39;t think that&#39;s a small amount for, you know, if you look at his salary. I mean, he&#39;s not running Coca-Cola here. I mean, running a small cap company to be able to go off into the sunset with 70 million bucks is uh is nothing to shake a stick at. So, Rue Reynolds, awesome interview with Jeff Edwards. Thank you for and posting online. Yeah. Well, they they they posted it first and then we posted it after uh based on some of the insights. Oh, based on some of the insights that weren&#39;t in your base case. Look, these were known to us, but we always shave off the whipped cream. The whipped cream is just going to be extra whipped cream for us about the cost per vehicle, China mixhift, hybrids, etc. Um, but if you listen carefully, which is why I&#39;m so interested to see who wins this contest with their takeaways from the interview, because you know there there&#39;s nothing if you if you did your work, there&#39;s nothing new. It&#39;s just he did a really good job of explaining what we&#39;ve been talking about here for three years because we did our work. So, um, and it&#39;s nice to hear it from the CEO versus just some guy who does his work. You know, if you&#39;re going to allocate a lot of money to something, you better know it inside out and upside down. Um, D. So yeah, you know, see what add up the two numbers that I gave on the on the call and then add a little bit more based on some of the things that you think are new information that we&#39;ve known, you know, that we basically were aware of the trends from listening to the quarterly conference calls, but we don&#39;t factor it in because that&#39;s upside like like the sneakers, React X. Okay, that&#39;s probably going to make some good money, but it&#39;s like we have zero attributed to it. So, uh, the AI stuff, the consulting that they&#39;re doing, all that stuff, they&#39;re going to make money on it. It&#39;s, we have it as a zero. We had China as a zero. So, now it&#39;s going to be more than that. That&#39;s great. We had Europe as a zero. It&#39;s going to be more than that. So, uh, fantastic. Uh but even we we if you cover underwrite the downside the upside what what I think is amazing from that interview is just the fact is if the volumes stayed where they are the amount of money that they can make 2 3 years out blew my mind. And god forbid we go up to 1718 with 40% more population. I think we could do 1820 if if if everything clicks all at once. It takes years and then it happens all at once. Ladies and gentlemen, Jared Bentley, first of all, love your podcast. Really appreciate all the hard work you put into it. Your insights are incredible. I recently tried blah blah blah. Okay. Uh, that&#39;s a Okay, cool. Uh, Don L, what&#39;s your thoughts on leases being treated as debt? Don, who cares? It&#39;s like old news. It&#39;s a year and a half old. There&#39;s nothing we can do about it. We focus on things we can control, not things we can&#39;t control. Should it be treated as debt? I can see the argument for that. I personally don&#39;t think it needs to be, but it is. So, on to the next uh JT investor. Tom, amazing job getting Jeff everywhere on the podcast. [Music] Got Yeah, I they&#39;ll be fine. JT, thanks for the advice. Theo Djardin, uh, thanks for all the education you&#39;re providing. I&#39;m sure you made people, uh, I&#39;m sure you made people looking at the business and not just stocks, which are things that go up and down. The Buffett of our age, that&#39;s very kind. I I&#39;m t\n\ntrends from listening to the quarterly conference calls, but we don&#39;t factor it in because that&#39;s upside like like the sneakers, React X.

What do you think about Cloudflare? Um, I think Cloudflare is going to be like black line and I&#39;m going to, you know, like Buffett, it&#39;s like you really have to be, you know, you got to be damn certain that you have a defensible mode. So, look, this thing is up 12x and now it&#39;s pulled back 5 cents and you think it&#39;s a bargain. Um, you know, it&#39;s funny. One of the\n\n### ASK_ME_ANYTHING_QA\nwhen you see the margin of safety is sufficient after recent draw down. What do you think about Cloudflare? Um, I think Cloudflare is going to be like black line and I&#39;m going to, you know, like Buffett, it&#39;s like you really have to be, you know, you got to be damn certain that you have a defensible mode. So, look, this thing is up 12x and now it&#39;s pulled back 5 cents and you think it&#39;s a bargain. Um, you know, it&#39;s funny. One of the questions\n\n### ASK_ME_ANYTHING_QA\n\nI would have preferred to buy my first share a lot lower. Uh, the good news is the work that I did was so comprehensive that I was able to buy down every time that it took longer than we wanted for it to go and bring our basis across all accounts to $83. So, if it hadn&#39;t taken so long, I wouldn&#39;t have half the position or even a quarter of the position that we have today. So, it&#39;s been the best thing that ever happened to us. Now, that said, what would I do differently is um and you probably noticed it in the last year is broken momentum stocks I stay away from. So, um they really have to put in a base for a while. Like you know if you look at uh PayPal for instance you know this was another broken momentum stock and you know we were kind of waiting down here until it had bottomed for a year year and a half before we got aggressive about it uh in the low 60s and and high 50s. So, uh, I would say that we&#39;re quicker to recognize when a growth stock is broken and wait to be looking after a couple of years in here versus at the first selloff uh, in here and then having to average down before you get the recovery back. So, um, and this is a kind of a perfect example of with Cloudflare is, um, you know, and a lot of people send us stocks that are up like 20x and they just pulled back, you know, 30 or 40% and they&#39;re like, they want to jump in because they&#39;re stuck in recency bias of uh, the success. But these things, you know, when they crack, they they tend to take a because they hurt. so many institutional shareholders, it takes an awful long time to rebuild that institutional base, which is why a lot of these uh take a couple of years to build bases and you know, get a new CEO, get a new plan, and then after they&#39;ve done that, then you get the first move, then you get the pullback, and then it starts to go. Same thing with Baba. And Baba had a couple fake outs because of government stuff that you can&#39;t control. So, this was a fake out here. Um, and then it took another year. We bought a ton ton more stock and then you got the move here, fake out, and now now it just wants to go. And we saw something similar in 2017. You can look back, you got that fake out, and then once it goes, it&#39;s straight up. Daytoday you&#39;ll see up $5, down $10, but it&#39;s lower highs, uh, higher higher highs and higher lows all the way up to the promised land. And I think this time will be no different. So I would say the only thing I would do different but that&#39;s why we&#39;ve always had the 8 to 10 I mean is because our work was was really good uh and we knew what we owned which is what gave us the confidence as it was going against us and everyone was crying uninvestable and ADR and all that that&#39;s completely useless noise um we kept adding so on the one hand we&#39;re more careful about buying broken growth stocks that haven&#39;t been broken for more than a year or two. Uh on the other hand, nothing&#39;s nothing&#39;s changed in our framework. That&#39;s just kind of technical noise. Uh that&#39;ll just give us a hair better timing, but we&#39;ll wind up with smaller positions because we have less time to know the company and less time to accumulate. So, I kind of like how it worked out. Uh but that would be the one key key uh learning lesson. \n### ASK_ME_ANYTHING_QA\nWhat are your thoughts on Coal Company BTU? Um, we&#39;ve gone through this one. I think the financials look fine. Uh, but it&#39;s not something we really want to be involved in. We&#39;ll just stick with natural gas for now. Interestingly enough, what did this thing do under Trump 1.0? Well, that was co Well, it started crashing before CO actually. So, uh, all right. I&#39;ll take a quick look. You&#39;re you&#39;re probably going to get a bounce here, so I don&#39;t want to tell you to to pass on it, but cash flow and revenues are all turning negative. So, I&#39;m not sure that that gives me a lot of confidence. The stock price reflects it. Question is, let&#39;s take a look at quarterly. See if they&#39;re actually turning at all. I I I don&#39;t want to be involved in this. Um, all right, River. River, we&#39;re we&#39;re playing that through com stock and we have a lot of reasons and a lot of outs with that. This one, it&#39;s just too binary. I had a friend who bought a ton of metal private deals in 2011. Thought he was a genius. Lost every penny. Uh, River Ray, what do you think of super lowro shoe vans? Good step in my opinion towards marketing toward women. I I leave those hard decisions to bracken. I just hire the jockey. He takes care of that stuff. I think they look super cool. Uh I think he&#39;s going to figure it out. All he&#39;s got to do, he told you what he wants to do. If you listen to all the calls, he wanted to detock. And then once he detocked, then he was going to get the machine going with advertising, influencers, etc. So once you see these things on uh Sabrina Carpenter or whatever, every single 12-year-old girl will buy them and it will be off to the races and people will say, &quot;Wow, how how did the stock go to 40 bucks? It&#39;s too expensive now.&quot; And then at 60, they&#39;ll buy it. and uh and then at 100 it&#39;ll be disbelief, but this is not a guy you want to bet against. Daniel Borman, thanks for the awesome podcast. Tom, what are your thoughts on Generrack rebound? I mean, look, we bought it below 100. It&#39;s it&#39;s up huge for us. So, uh would we put new money to work here? 100%. As new client money comes in, probably Generrack will be on the list at these levels for sure. Uh easy peasy. Jack Corners Cornes, thanks for all you do for us. Uh, ASOS. Okay, we covered that for you this week. Nothing yet for us. Patrick Kelly hard. Thanks for all your hard work. I found you by accident when I told a friend that I was going to start a position in Alibaba in early 2023. Told me to check out your weekly podcast because you were also long baba. Uh, thanks for helping me stay the course through the long sideways grind. You&#39;re welcome. It wasn&#39;t an easy time and it was a very lonely voice, but [Music] uh oh, he says, &quot;I&#39;m curious if there are any money managers in the business that if you found out we&#39;re on the opposite side of one of their trades would make you go back and check your work.&quot; Uh, answer is no. As a matter of fact, I&#39;ve had some of my most successful positions have had multi-billionaires on the other side of the trade. I mean, being long the market in 2022, I had Ray Dallio on the other side of the trade. I mean, who who who could scare you more than Ray Dio, one of the best hedge fund managers of all time. It&#39;s been bearish the whole way up since 2022. So, um, no, I do my own work. I I don&#39;t read a lot of secondhand material. I always go to s source material. Um, and uh, you know, just as God didn&#39;t give me the FOMO gene, he doesn&#39;t give me the distraction gene. I do my own work. I draw my own conclusions. I, you know, I have my filters. Would I put 100% of my net worth into into this to buy the whole business if JP Morgan was going to finance the debt? And the answer has to be yes. And to come to a yes answer is not casual. It&#39;s not some technical stupid breakout pattern like all these schmucks talk about on TV. It&#39;s about knowing what you own and what are the current prospects of cash generation and the future prospects of cash generation and the leadership and all that goes into it and the channel checks and the competition analysis and it and just instinct, you know, and seeing what works and not, you know, um and instinct on people is a is a big thing as it relates to uh the jockeyies that are running your business for you. Axel B could uh cover that. Zack Hong. Okay. He&#39;s asking which college to go to. Okay. Rick Richard. Okay. So, uh Rick, by the way, Rick&#39;s a super smart guy. Um, longtime listener, congratulations on winning number one podcast recently in the hedge fund category by the way. Uh, welld deserved. Can you explain a little more about your framework for E for setting exit valuations? Is a lot of comps based on enterprise or no has nothing to do with comps or any of that? Uh, how how often do you find yourself allowing to reset the price higher based on new information or vice versa, lower exit price? Um, if I&#39;m taking my exit price down lower, I might be thinking about getting about getting out of a position completely. Uh, that rarely happens. Um, and it I can&#39;t think of any time it&#39;s ever happened with a full-size position. So, uh, I&#39;ll leave that. As far as taking it up, I think with Bracken, it&#39;s it&#39;s definitely changed. I thought it was going to be a quick double to 45. Well, that would have been a triple to 45 and we&#39;d be out. looking at what he&#39;s doing and how he&#39;s thinking about it and his background, uh, I do think this he&#39;s going to take this thing to new highs and beyond. Um, but I have to see quarterto quarter, you know, what he says and what he does. So far, he&#39;s doing exactly what he says, just like Shane O Kelly with Advanced Auto Parts, by the way. But, um, if if if I get a couple quarters where they&#39;re changing what they say or taking their expectation down, then I have to adjust. I haven&#39;t seen that yet. Um, will I take it up? I think that&#39;s that&#39;s exactly what Bracken talks, but it usually has to do with cash flow. It usually and and then there&#39;s just a million factors that go into when I know it&#39;s reached the crescendo and and a lot of you have been with me for these exits and and I usually get pretty damn close to the top, which is just, you know, maybe some of it&#39;s luck, but most of it is just experience. Um and and often times we don&#39;t it&#39;s not binary. We&#39;ll usually keep a trailer on because just as these companies overshoot to the downside, they tend to overshoot to the upside. Overshoot to the downside with dispondency, overshoot to the upside with euphoria. Um so we&#39;re getting in in tranches and getting out in tranches uh around that intrinsic value. Um, but a lot of the secret sauce comes down to cash generation. How it, you know, in the businesses that are cyclical, that&#39;s pretty easy for us to know where we want to be out. Um, and in the but but as far as like oh it&#39;s peers are trading at this and that I&#39;d be more interested in looking at its historic multiple channel than its comp multiple channel because there are unique attributes to each business that we own and u and and proprietary modes based on the technology andor the products that they have andor the brand equity that they have. Uh so it&#39;s not a it&#39;s not a simple answer, but we do know when things are pushed to the top of ranges and we do know kind of what the max out earnings power is going to be for the type of businesses we&#39;re buying. If you&#39;re buying the guess the future businesses, there&#39;s no there&#39;s no way to tell. There&#39;s absolutely which is why we don&#39;t do those. If you notice, all the businesses we buy have been around for 5 10 20 30 years. So we can see how they operate through different cycles and how they&#39;re proven to operate through cycles and where they tend to peak out in the next cycle. And and that&#39;s a little easier than saying, you know, this thing&#39;s the next future of whatever curing cancer or, you know, Bitcoin or all these things that you&#39;re just guessing. And then you got these people looking at charts thinking they have some edge. It&#39;s it&#39;s comical. So, uh, I buy businesses that I can understand how they operate, how they recover and where they come out in terms of relationship to intrinsic value and in excess of it. And that&#39;s kind of how we think about where we&#39;re getting out in the future. And we adjust based on if management does a lot better job. And we might miss upside on that, but um, that&#39;s okay. We know what we have to get out of each investment. Uh, what is this? Jason Patel. Oh, okay. He&#39;s talking about the China thing in CPS. Um, Gleb Sitikov, thanks for your podcast. It&#39;s probably the most efficient two hours spent per week. Tremendous value packed in each episode. Five below. I think a lot of these tariff hit retail retailers um are going to make a comeback whether it&#39;s Dollar General, Dollar Tree. Let&#39;s take a look at Five Below. Probably five below, maybe even Target. I think you&#39;re probably okay there. Let&#39;s just see here though. I want to see. Yeah. So, this is a broken momentum stock. This might I mean this could certainly bounce back straight back up for sure. Um, but it also wouldn&#39;t surprise me when it&#39;s broken like this if it takes a few years to build a base. So, that&#39;s kind of the nuance. So, I mean, looking at the financials here, my guess is we&#39;re going to come to the conclusion that it does make sense to buy it. But in terms of the reality of all the broken investors in this thing, uh this was a 10 bagger that is now broken. Uh you know, the one takeaway would be, okay, let&#39;s talk about it in a year and if it&#39;s between, you know, 40 and 80, let&#39;s start to build a position. And you&#39;re like, why would you do that if the revenues continue to go up and the earnings continue to go up? Because so many people chased up here at Euphoria, they&#39;re just broken and they&#39;re stuck with recency bias that it&#39;s broken forever. Like you&#39;re seeing like you saw in Baba as it built the base, like you saw in PayPal as it built the base. These people are broken mofos. They lost a lot of money because they chased up here after the 26 bagger and they bought this thinking it was cheap uh when it was a broken momentum stock. So, uh, with this one, I would, uh, I, you know, let&#39;s just take a look at the cash flow. Yeah, I mean, everything kind of looks okay. You know, 1.7 billion in debt, 500 cash. probably gonna be generally okay, but I wouldn&#39;t be in a rush. I&#39;d probably pass like if I missed the move from 60 back to 200. So, I missed it. But like if this thing languishes for a couple of years uh and builds a base and you know all the hurt people get out of the stock at the lows uh then it becomes more interesting. So that would be a lesson that I took away to answer Shavein&#39;s uh uh question which was a good one. Uh Jimmy Jones, Unilver, we&#39;ve covered that. Let&#39;s just kind of snore. Unilver. Yeah. No, not for me. Um next. Why are you sending me two this week? Uh Jeffy, wait. If you&#39;re inclined to build an income or covered calls, look, no. Why? Why are you screwing around with this kind of nonsense? I look, if you like a company, just buy the damn company. Why would you want it called away from you? all this about, oh, the the stock went down. And then you hear them say, but I wrote cover calls on it, so I got a dollar and the stock&#39;s down $40. It&#39;s like, wow, you&#39;re brilliant. Like, simplify. That&#39;s all I&#39;m going to tell you guys. Just simplify your lives. Um, and and you don&#39;t have to screw around with that stuff because it works for a while and it doesn&#39;t. If you want to get into the options game, learn how to sell them, not how to buy them. Now, what we do for clients with the overlays and elongated. If you&#39;re going to be a buyer, you want to be over the long term. If you&#39;re going to be a seller, you want to be in the next 30 days where you get the time decay. But that&#39;s that&#39;s like a 4hour conversation, which I&#39;m not going to have. Uh Jason Zen uh Jason goes into trade desk based on last week and he has experience with it and he&#39;s he&#39;s a pass trying to give me some insight on the technology. I appreciate that cuz I asked for it. John Lou by sheer chance came across your weekly podcast confidently say it helped me find my footing in investing going forward. I appreciate all the work you&#39;ve done. Uh, okay. So, the CPS question was answered. Carolyn H, first, thank you for helping us all understand what makes Mr. Market tick. You&#39;re welcome. By the way, thank you for all these kind comments, guys, because a lot of work does go into this. And um, all right. Grateful to be out of the mainstream view of stocks and into the method of understanding value in business I own part of. There&#39;s been a lot of talk about recession lady lately, which got me thinking. Obviously, recession shouldn&#39;t change the framework for picking high quality business at a dislocated price, but does it change the strategy for inquiring them? Perhaps they might take longer for price to reach intrinsic value. Anything else to be thinking about? I think you answered your own question. If you get a recession, it just takes longer. Um, but if you start getting in the predict a recession game, uh, good luck because you&#39;ll be in the DIO camp for the last three years and miss 100% ups. VSCO [Music] stock. Uh, Victorious Secret. They destroyed this brand. I mean, the bottom line is there&#39;s no way I&#39;m going to say this that is going to sound nice. So, I&#39;m probably not going to say everything that&#39;s on my mind. But the bottom line is lingerie is supposed to be sexy. Okay? When you try to make it something other than that, then you&#39;re not selling lingerie and you lose the cache for the whole brand. When Victoria&#39;s Secret hummed, they had the supermodels. Now they don&#39;t have superm models because they don&#39;t want to pay them all that money, so they just put women up. And long story short, I think this is completely destroyed. My guess is they&#39;re trying to reverse that. Um, VCO Yeah, there&#39;s no thing is there there&#39;s some stability here, but there&#39;s no inflection yet. And that&#39;s so all I can tell you is I would want to understand is there a new CEO? What&#39;s their plan? What is their track record of success? And on those bases, you know, if they if they get back to their roots, kind of like what Vans is trying to do right now. [Music] Um, and that&#39;s what Bracken did. He spent time getting to know the family and learning the business from the 60s forward. he knows the business like the back of his hand and the culture and everything else then I think there&#39;s a chance but you know that&#39;s that&#39;s hours and hours of conference calls learning the whole thing and um it looks like they might have troughed here so I think it warrants further investigation I do and have heard in art right reading articles etc that they are moving back to toward what made them successful so if you can get some confidence around that um it&#39;s probably worth a look. Um, yeah, share count has come down. So, some things are going in the right direction. Sounds like they&#39;ve got someone new running it and doing it properly. So, Medi, thank you for bringing it to us. I think it warrants further exploration. All right, I think we got a couple more here. Oh, Valeris offshore driller. Okay, so Vle wants to know about Rick Hospitality, which is a rollup of nudie bars. Okay, the guy who did this, I got pitched on this when I was in Puerto Rico, and the pitch is fantastic. The guy who actually runs it understands return on invested capital, understands how to do a rollup, understands how to do a business. What he doesn&#39;t understand is the fact that no institutional money manager that wants to keep his job is going to have a big position in strip clubs and that&#39;s why they&#39;re never going to get the sponsorship that they know. So, I would bet on the guy if he went into another rollup. fact that he&#39;s in this roll up, it&#39;s going to be very very very hard to get the type of sponsorship you need to have a monster winner. So on that basis, I&#39;m a pass. Um uh let&#39;s take a look at Aaris. These are all the guys wanting to get offshore drillers. Um the problem with this one is it hasn&#39;t been around long enough for me to be comfortable with it, but I&#39;ll take a quick look at the financials because I do think these services are going to move. I would pick something easier like you know maybe Hallebertton or maybe no National Oil Well Varco but that one&#39;s a stretch or maybe um Slumber I mean that&#39;s one&#39;s kind of a no-brainer but the key is there&#39;s not enough margin of safety. So this is still negative free cash flow revenues are going up. It&#39;s too new for me. So I&#39;m I&#39;m a pass on this. Um and I&#39;ll leave it at that. Okay, that&#39;s client inquiry. And that&#39;s it. So, we&#39;ll be back next week, same time, same place. In the meantime, make it a great one. Thank you for tuning in. Bye for [Music] now. Heat. [Music] Heat. Heat. Heat.

    "FEATURED_COMPANY_DEEP_DIVES": "\n\n### FEATURED_COMPANY_DEEP_DIVES\nwe had the most incredible week and the most incredible opportunity to interview the CEO of Cooper Standard, Mr. Jeff Edwards, the chairman and CEO. And you know, you&#39;re going to be blown away by how Jeff explains the company, where it&#39;s been, where it is, and where it&#39;s going. Uh, but one of the key themes of our podcast for the last 5 years has been to burden yourself with the facts. And my good friend and client Damian L got me these caps. They&#39;re Nike. Uh they say burden yourself with the facts. Great Hill Capital. Absolutely incredible. Tag still on. We&#39;ve got 10 of these. And what I want to do this week is we&#39;re going to run a promotion for the 10 or so best responses. is you&#39;re going to comment below in the YouTube section of the comment section and say what was your number one takeaway or what did you learn from listening to Jeff Edwards in this interview which they&#39;ve posted on their uh investor relations part of their website you can go to cooperstandard.com. Obviously, we are large shareholders of Cooper Standards, so full disclosure there. We got involved with the company in May of 2022. We thought we were geniuses buying the stock in the fives. Uh, and then it immediately went into the threes and we bought more because we had done our work. Uh, and the stock was down because they needed to refinance the debt. They did. that largely gives them runway uh well to 2027 and beyond. And we&#39;re going to talk a little bit about that. We think well beyond. Uh and uh the idea for getting involved in Cooper Standard was actually uh a person that I look up to tremendously who recently passed is Charlie Mer. And Charlie Munger did a very similar investment in the 2001 recession, a cyclical trough in the industry. Uh, and this is a pretty regular occurrence as Jeff will tell you in the auto business. It is very cyclical. Uh, and uh, Charlie read an article in Baronss and he invested $10 million in Tenico when it was down some 95%. They refinanced the debt. He turned the 10 million into 80 million in a reasonable amount of time and then he gave that 80 million to Leelu who invested in China which was out of fa favor and turned it into a half a billion dollars. So, two chess moves, a half a billion dollars. That&#39;s the good news. I think we&#39;re going to do a lot better with Cooper Standard than Charlie did in Tenico.\n\n obviously, we are large shareholders of Cooper Standards, so full disclosure there.

And that&#39;s why we have our very special guest again, chairman and CEO of Cooper Standard, Mr. Jeff Edwards. Thank you again. So, I think I&#39;ll get right down to it here. Uh, and I want to ask you some\n### FEATURED_COMPANY_DEEP_DIVES\nquestions . I&#39;m usually on the other side of the question, so bear with me as an interviewer. But um first question is in your most recent conference call, you provided guidance that suggests Cooper Standard will continue to expand margins in 2025 despite an expected decline in North North American light vehicle production and essentially flat revenue. Uh you also mentioned launching new business at higher variable contribution margins than in the past. A few\n\nquestions . I&#39;m usually on the other side of the question, so bear with me as an interviewer. But um first question is in your most recent conference call, you provided guidance that suggests Cooper Standard will continue to expand margins in 2025 despite an expected decline in North North American light vehicle production and essentially flat revenue. Uh you also mentioned launching new business at higher variable contribution margins than in the past. A few\n### FEATURED_COMPANY_DEEP_DIVES\nquestions  here Jeeoff. Uh first is that how you drive the margin expansion? What&#39;s driving the higher uh uh margin expansion the VCM? And how much higher can this get? That&#39;s a good question, Tom. And I I&#39;ll start by talking about the things that we can control, right? I mean ultimately um I I think the industry we we talk a lot about uh about price but to be fair uh with inside Cooper Standard about four or five years ago as we were facing what felt like uh an insurmountable headwind uh be it pandemics or be it uh industry downturn whatever you want to call it. uh we really turned our attention internal and and started focusing on our our fixed costs and and really driving fixed costs to a uh an all-time low level as we sat here today and our teams everywhere in every region went to work on this because basically what we said is we&#39;re either going to make money in every region with each of our two products or we&#39;re going to do something else. Uh so it really put a laser-like focus on on uh those fixed costs which we&#39;ve taken out consistently over the last five years. So that&#39;s certainly driven a lot of this margin expansion. Uh the other thing that we did related to variable contribution margin is we reestablished what we felt were our fair hurdle rates when we went into the customer and started bidding on programs really in each region with each each customer. uh we established these hurdle rates and and we found very quickly that that with our technology and with our ability to execute as well as we do that that those price points were holding. And so in in combination with taking the cost down, controlling what we can control and at the same time establishing a very clear process internally so that every salesperson and every leader, every plant manager in the world understood what those hurdle rates were. So they were doing their part to take the cost down and those people that go to the customer to win new business had to make sure that we did it at a price point that was fair. Fair for the customer and fair for us. And those were the two reasons that you see the margin expansion that you see. So we&#39;re really proud of that. I I think probably most importantly it&#39;s a sustainable uh business model. So we&#39;ll continue to do our fair share of taking costs out as we improve efficiencies in our plants. There&#39;s still a few things that we would like to do around the world, but most of it is is uh where we want it. The last piece related to to what we can control is our material cost as a percent of sale. And this year, we&#39;re really working with our supply base. Uh working with our engineering teams to provide us different options as it relates to the decisions that we&#39;re taking related to material costs for both our fluid and our ceiling business. So we&#39;re not done yet, but at least uh certainly the trend is in the right direction. Fantastic. Fantastic. So let&#39;s assume you can drive a variable contribution margin of uh improvement of around 500 basis points over the next two to three years as those new contacts uh contracts kick in and and roll over. Um assuming an apocalyptic scenario, which is I what I like to do as an investor. uh if you if you can underwrite the downside, the upside will take care of itself. Um that US production volumes don&#39;t even grow. So So first cycle, and by the way, this would be the first cycle peak since the 1970s. That didn&#39;t peak over 18 million plus units since 1970. And by the way, back then the population was 40% less than it is today. uh and we&#39;ll talk a little bit about that. But this still implies this is again apocalyptic scenarios. We stay in the 15s. Um we&#39;re looking at uh an additional 135 million of IBIDA or total 330 million of IBIDA. So if my math is correct, assuming these apocalyptic volumes in the mid15s, this business can earn5 to $6 a share two to three years out on margin expansion alone. Uh th this is a testament to how you&#39;ve managed the business through this ex extended cycle trough which uh basically was a one in aundred year event. I mean the pandemic and uh the the industry cycle all at the same time. So number one, is this a reasonable way to think about the business? This is kind of my my operating model. And if so, say a little more how you did that because it&#39;s it&#39;s just mindboggling to me that that uh um your execution has been so quick and so precise to put us in a position that this is a reality. Well, thank you. It&#39;s very kind. I can&#39;t confirm the numbers that you just rattled off there, but but I can tell you that directionally you&#39;re correct. Okay. And then how we how we accomplish that, I guess, is probably the most important thing. So really, I I I mentioned it in the in the first question, but but in addition to to focusing on taking the cost down and and being more consistent about the pricing side as well, we reorganized here last year. So we&#39;re we&#39;re about a year and a quarter into this new organization structure where where we have three businesses now. We have our ceiling business, we have our fluid business, and then we have our industrial and specialty product group, which is a much smaller non-automotive business that we have some good growth plans for. But sticking primarily with sealing and fluid for today&#39;s discussion, Tom, uh it allowed us to put two presidents in charge, one each of those businesses, one for each of those businesses. We gave them their own dedicated teams from manufacturing to engineering to purchasing everything they need uh within their team to drive the day-to-day performance of those businesses. So uh didn&#39;t matter what 20 countries were doing business. It didn&#39;t matter uh that that 21,000 employees come to work every day, half of them in each business. Uh but what are we going to do? How are we going to get those teams focused? Give them the resources. give them the the investment dollars that they need to grow the business profitably, but at the same time hold them accountable uh for driving uh VCM margin expansion and ultimately returning this business to double digit EBIDA and double digit return on invested capital and and that&#39;s exactly what we saw happen uh in 2024 and why uh our guidance for 25 suggests we&#39;re going to return to those double-digit EBDA numbers. numbers for both of those businesses at the end of 25. Uh as we start 20 uh6 we clearly will be a double digit IBIDA and a double-digit return on invested capital company. Okay, that&#39;s that&#39;s great. Are you going to slide back down the mountain? No. And why is because the way we have structured these two businesses, the leaders that we have in charge, and we&#39;re not asking people to do three and four jobs, right? they they can stay focused within the lanes. Our plants pretty much are divided up by sealing and fluid. So t\n\n### FEATURED_COMPANY_DEEP_DIVES\nwe reorganized here last year.

So t\n\n### MEDIA_APPEARANCE_RECAP\nmoving along , want to thank Jake Mack and Taylor Riggs for having me on the Clayman Countdown Fox Business. This week, we got to discuss, uh, two of my favorite companies, Alibaba and Lip Booan for Intel. Listen in here. But are markets, at least today, looking through the data and focusing on the fundamentals of some of these companies, which do indeed remain strong. Joining us now, I&#39;m pleased to say, region&#39;s chief investment officer Alan Mcnite and Great Hill Capital Chairman Thomas Hayes.\n### QUOTES_OF_THE_WEEK\nWell, Taylor, I think Warren Buffett said it best. Be greedy when others are fearful. And every single fear indicator is completely washed out. The AI sentiment showed just 19% of retail investors were bullish last week. They bought record puts after the market was down. you want to buy that house insurance before the fire. Uh and hedge funds were record selling stocks in the hole. These are all contrarian indicators and this is when we look for opportunities. We&#39;re seeing the Fed put back in play for June. 82% chance of a cut in June.\n### MISCELLANEOUS\nAnd we&#39;re seeing utilities and AI play still. It is. And I think that&#39;s where utilities is now a growth name. And if you had told me 10 years ago I would buy utilities for the growth, I would have said you&#39;re crazy. But today you look at the type of growth they can generate because of data center growth, because of AI that is fueling that data center growth. And suddenly you&#39;re really seeing an opportunity there, particularly in the southeast part of the country where you&#39;re seeing continued population demand as well.\n### FEATURED_COMPANY_DEEP_DIVES\nTom, um I&#39;m not calling you crazy, but a lot of people might call you crazy when I look and one of your top picks right now is Intel. This is a great storied American company. They just announced, I believe on Friday, a new CEO, but this is a company that has struggled. Why Intel? And why Intel at $25? Well, Taylor Lip Bhutan is the new CEO. He came from Cadence Designs when the stock was down 86% in 2009. If you had invested $1 million when he became CEO, by the time he stepped down 14 years later in 2023, that $1 million became $68 million. Lip Bhutan is a miracle worker and Intel needs a miracle and I think they&#39;re going to get it. You know, the key thing\n\n### MEDIA_APPEARANCE_RECAP\nlast week were getting a little nervous like, \"Oh my gosh, is the bottom here? Is there more room to run?\" But on the other hand, people are like, \"Look, everything is 10% on sale now. And if I liked a sweater at 100, I like it even more at 90.\" we still think communication services, we think utilities look cheap here, and it's all about the earnings. And I think we're going to see as we get into first quarter earning season, if you can continue to buy companies that are delivering earnings in excess of 10 15% growth, it pays to go shopping when things are on sale. And we're seeing utilities and AI play still. And I think that's where utilities is now a growth name. And if you had told me 10 years ago I would buy utilities for the growth, I would have said you're crazy. But today you look at the type of growth they can generate because of data center growth, because of AI that is fueling that data center growth. And suddenly you're really seeing an opportunity there, particularly in the southeast part of the country where you're seeing continued population demand as well.\n### FEATURED_COMPANY_DEEP_DIVES\nI look and one of your top picks right now is Intel.

If you had invested $1 million when he became CEO, by the time he stepped down 14 years later in 2023, that $1 million became $68 million. Lip Bhutan is a miracle worker and Intel needs a miracle and I think they're going to get it. You know, the key thing here is\n\n### FEATURED_COMPANY_DEEP_DIVES\nNvidia&#39;s growth rate has decelerated, not for lack of demand, but for lack of supply. TSMC is at capacity. Intel in the background has been building up the fabs. They&#39;re ready for prime time. Nvidia&#39;s testing chips. Broadcom is testing chips. And Lip Bhutan is going to spike the football in the end zone. We&#39;re very excited about Intel. And it&#39;s trading just a couple bucks over tangible book value. So, if they liquidated the whole company today, you get most of your money back. And if he does what he could do, which we know he can, it could be a double and beyond in the next 12 to 24 months. But Tom, a lot of people are thinking that Intel I mean I&#39;ve heard um you know not rumors but you know words used like they&#39;re selling the car for parts, right? Where you had rumors about Broadcom, TSMC coming and looking at different portions of the business. Do you like it as a sum of the whole or do you like it as different parts? Look, if they sell it off for parts, we probably get 3540 bucks when all is said and done. Lit Bhutan has stated he&#39;s going to run this business. He&#39;s not interested in a fire sale. He&#39;s going to turn this into a multibagger. Everything is there. Actually, Gellzinger did lay the found foundry uh uh framework to move ahead and to supply the Nvidia and the Broadcoms of the world. Lip Bhan is going to finish that execution at the five yard line, take it in for a touchdown. This is going to be, look, it was on no one&#39;s bingo card at the beginning of this year that Nvidia would be among the worst chip producers this year in terms of performers. And Intel is now the top performing semiconductor company for year-to- date 2025. Okay. I think people might say that says more about Nvidia than it does about Intel. We&#39;ll see. But Tom, I do like the bull call. \n\nYeah, I look, we continue to like China and people said we were crazy when we were buying Alibaba in the 90s, in the 80s, in the 60s. Now it&#39;s over 145, going to over 200 over the next 12 to 24 months. I&#39;m telling you, Intel is going to be the exact same way, Taylor. They&#39;re calling me crazy now. when it&#39;s at 40 50 60 they&#39;re gonna say wow you know it&#39;s is it time to buy at 60 and I&#39;m gonna say yeah it&#39;s probably going higher lip banan is a miracle worker why don&#39;t we make crazy good again sometimes my husband calls me a little crazy and look I didn&#39;t turn out so bad so maybe a little crazy isn&#39;t so bad really appreciate both of you Alan Mcnite and Thomas Hayes please come back and join me thank you Taylor mean and we&#39;re back and then I got to join uh uh two incredible, well, three incredible people on the Money Show podcast this week. I want to thank Mike Larson for having me on. As always, my buddy Kenny Pulcari and Jim Bianco, who is a bond expert uh and macroeconomic expert was great to be on with the three of them.\n\n### MEDIA_APPEARANCE_RECAP\nWell, I think this is pretty standard, Mike. This is what we see pretty much every four years, uh, post-election year. You see some weakness in February through mid-Marchch and then you start to find a bottom. And why why is that pretty uniform going back, you know, hundred something years is because uh people want to get a sense of what the policy is. And it doesn&#39;t have to be good policy. It just needs to be known policy. And I think that&#39;s what we&#39;re grappling with uh with Trump right now. But I like I I say to many people, welcome to Trump 2.0. Same as Trump 1.0. New day, new headline, new tweet, new volatility resolves higher over time. Uh and what I like what we saw last week is uh a big flush out. You know, record selling by hedge funds. Uh that&#39;s a contrarian indicator. Uh a lot of momentum followers there. Overlever retail uh investors bought record insurance, record put buying after the house was already burned down. You want to buy those insurance premiums before the fire starts. Uh so you can&#39;t make that up. Then you had the largest drop in US equity allocation on record in the Bank of America fund manager survey. uh which we saw this week. So I I think I think we&#39;re finding a a situation where we can go in and buy stocks. Uh as for the MAG 7, you know, at your events towards the end of the year, I was saying the theme was going to be a shift out of the Mag 7 into the unmagnificent 493 and more importantly into into international. That&#39;s played out uh as anticipated. We think that theme will continue. And Mag 7, you got to look at two things. Number one, one thing no one&#39;s paying attention to that I&#39;ve seen is the Japanese carry trade unwind. Okay? And all you need to do is look at 10-year JGBs and what you see what used to be free hot money now has a cost. 10-year JGB yields are at 20ear highs. Those have continued to creep up aggressively in the last four weeks. And as a result, the most impacted part of the market has been the MAG 7 where all that hot money has been parked. So, I do think that yes, we are due for a technical bounce. Uh, maybe MAG 7 will trade back up to the top of the range, but I think the theme for 2025 will continue. MAG 7 will underperform relative to 493 and dramatically underperform relative to international as we&#39;ve seen. Y, thanks Tom. Let me a little bit. I mean, you&#39;ve talked international, you mentioned Alibaba. Is there anything else that that particularly excites you now? I know you&#39;ve talked about some names at our past events, but we&#39;re getting towards the end of Q1, so I figured I&#39;d uh I&#39;d see if there&#39;s anything new that&#39;s on your radar screen. Look, I I think uh Intel is the most underrated story. If they liquidated the whole damn thing today, you&#39;d probably get about 22 23 bucks. It&#39;s trading at 25. Lip Banan uh was at Cadence Designs, which makes the software for all of these chip designers. Lip Bhutan became CEO of Cadence Designs in January 2009 after the stock was down 86%. If you&#39;d put a million dollars with this guy, uh by the time he stepped down as executive chairman 14 years later in 2023, that $1 million became $68 million. 68 bagger. This guy is a miracle worker. Intel needs a miracle. he&#39;s going to deliver and he&#39;s not interested in partnerships or selling it off for parts. He&#39;s going to run this thing up the flag pole. And here&#39;s the thing, Nvidia is not down because of lack of demand. Nvidia is down because of lack of supply. TSMC is at capacity and only gives them $4 billion of revenue growth per quarter, which on a bigger base decelerates the revenue growth from 250% down to probably 30 40% by the end of this year. They need capacity. TSMC could say, &quot;Yes, Mr. Trump, we&#39;re going to invest a trillion dollars in the United States.&quot; The problem is it&#39;s going to take them four to five years to get to where Intel is with their fabs today. So, love Gellzinger or hate him, he did one thing over the last four years. He set Intel up for success. And Lip Bhan is going to come in and spike the football in the end zone as uh these this chip production comes on on board. Right now, Nvidia and Broadcom are testing their chip in Intel&#39;s US fabs. And from what we have gotten back through media, it&#39;s going quite well. This game is just be beginning for Intel for everyone saying, &quot;Oh, Intel&#39;s going out of business.&quot; I mean, give me a break. They&#39;ve done over $50 billion of revenue in the last 12 months being completely mismanaged. And now you got someone who can who can ride this horse to the promised land, and we&#39;re getting on with them. Yeah. As an old school person, you know, all I can do is reminisce about the Winel days, right? Why we only have a couple minutes left. I want to make sure just for anybody watching, uh Jim is going to be joining us in Dallas and Miami. Uh Tom and Kenny are going to be joining us at the Miami Symposium in May. Guys, if you have maybe 30 45 seconds to just give a preview preview of what you you think you&#39;re going to be talking about. Tom, maybe I&#39;ll go to you first and uh let you do that now. Yeah. I think one of my segments is going to be how the uninvestable became investable while we were building up our Baba position. and everyone said it&#39;s uninvestable. It&#39;s uninvestable. It&#39;s uninvestable. We&#39;re going to talk about kind of market sentiment that goes into that, how you can see through the noise, look under the cover, uh follow the fundamentals. In the short term, the market is a voting machine based on emotions like you saw in the last two years in China. In the long term, it&#39;s a weighing machine based on fundamentals like you&#39;re seeing right now. Uh and then we&#39;re going to talk about some uh in the second segment, some year-end picks, year-end outlook. A lot of opportunities to make money in the second half of this year. So, we&#39;re really excited to go down to Miami and deliver a lot of value.\n\n### MISCELLANEOUS\nAnd we&#39;re back. And uh and this is the event that Mike and I referenced in the Money Show interview. I&#39;ll be speaking at the Money Show in Miami. The event is from the 15th through the 17th. My two segments are on Saturday the 17th before I fly to go see my friends in Dubai. Uh looking forward to that. So you can register either at the money show website miamimmms.com or go to hedge funips.com and just put Miami in the search bar and this will come up and you can register there. Uh then I had a chance to join Diego on um CGTN America. Want to thank Diego and Chamellia Kilawan for having me on. This was about Tesla and Elon Musk. You can go ahead and watch that at hedgefundtips.com. And I want to thank Yahoo Naomi Buchanan for including me in her in her article on Yahoo Finance about the carry trade. And now our\n\n### TECHNICAL_CHARTS\nWTI crude oil, it&#39;s in this range. I think this is going to probably resolve higher and some of the oil stocks are going to go with it. Uh, we continue to like our com stock resource, which we bought much lower. Um, uh, WTI crude. So yeah, again, I just not finding anything in oil and gas that makes me super excited, but they&#39;re all going to go up marginally. \n\n### FEATURED_COMPANY_DEEP_DIVES\ncopper, this is uh doc Dr. Copper has a PhD in economics. That&#39;s a leading indicator for global growth, which tells you that China&#39;s coming back. uh which we know from Alibaba, our largest position, which has fortunately gone straight up this year, which is exciting. Higher highs, higher lows. Um looks like some of these semis want to bounce. PayPal. God, I love it here. Every new dollar that comes in, we&#39;re we&#39;ve been able to uh pick up some PayPal. We&#39;ll be picking up some more VF Corp. all these incredible companies that we&#39;re excited about. Um, Generrack even has come into a point where it actually add even though we bought well below 100. Uh, I&#39;d love to add more at these levels. Pretty excited about that.\n\n### FEATURED_COMPANY_DEEP_DIVES\ndollars of his own cash uh which is material and um and we're invested alongside of him so kudos to all of my investors who are now able to uh participate in that and um and the game is just beginning. So, we'll look for any opportunities to add more and take advantage because this is one that you just buy, close your eyes, and in 5 years you have a multibagger. I think this thing's going to be probably the calculations I did when we got involved uh sometime back at around I don't know when let's see when was it I think our base is around $11. I can't find the mouse for the other computer. I think it was 1176 but I'm cuffing that. But um I think the calculation I have internally is like an 8 to10 bagger over a decade. So I think I was looking at like an 80 to $100 stock. So um we'll see as the facts change we could change our mind. Usually with Brad the facts get better as time goes on. So it could be a lot better. So but that's one you just sit there and let him work his magic. No one has created more wealth for shareholders than Brad Jacobs repeatedly over time. Certainly Buffett has created fortunes for people, but that was a one-trick pony. Uh, and a great pony, don't get me wrong, probably the best pony in the world. But, uh, Brad keeps doing it over and over, and I love the timing, and I love the play, and I love the fragmentation, and I see what he sees. And then he has this magic touch where he not only does good economic accretive uh acquisitions, but uh he finds a way to put in innovative technologies to really juice the margins and really get efficiency out of and uh uniformity out of all the acquisitions and that just drops huge amounts of cash to the owners. And uh and that's all he wakes up thinking about every single day. If you've read his books and you've listened to him and you've seen what he's done for shareholders over the years, we're super excited about that and um and glad he finally  got that done. Uh and that's what happens. Winners win and Brad Jacobs is a winner. \n### HEADLINES_AND_NEWS\nSo, uh US natural gas prices up on record flows to LG export plants. Cooler weather forecast.

You can uh watch it. You can go to their website, the investor relations, Cooper Standard investor relations site, and watch it there or look at all their other decks and presentations. Um, again, all opinion, not advice. This just gives the background of the thesis when we came out with it publicly in 2022. uh what we were saying then and some of our past articles about it which you can find all at hedge funfundtips.com and then the Bank of America fund manager survey came out this week and we put out the summary here are the top five points largest pullback in sentiment since March of 2020 the bottom of the COVID lows people are more pessimistic than then uh which was unbelievable buying opportunity number two record rotation out of US stocks falling to a net 23% underweight. The lowest allocation since June of 2023 was on no one's bingo card coming into the new year. I remember speaking at one of these conferences and talking with some big names that you know very well. They were kind of laughing at me. They're like, \"Oh, you're just contrarian to be contrarian. You know, what's to say international is going to work?\" Blah, blah, blah. And these guys were the ones that were most overweight mag 7 and pounding the table at the top with all the shiny objects and um and that's the way it goes. Record rotation out of US stocks. We got that. Uh opinion follows trend as most managers are most bullish on China versus US growth since May of 2023. Just beginning. Dividend stocks continue to get bid. Remember last year we were just every single week buy uh with the largest monthly rotation on record into high versus low dividend yield. FMS cash levels went from a 15-year low last month to their largest one-month jump since 2021 December. Uh, hat tip to my buddy PV. Uh, leave him anonymous. Uh, China rolled out an action plan for boosting consumption, which might be the Chinese equivalent of quote doing whatever it takes. If you remember during the European debt crisis in 2011, Draghy came out and said we'll do whatever it takes and squeezed all of the shorts and completely destroyed the bond vigilantes. That's exactly what China is doing now that you are going to see opinion follow trend like nobody's business in the next 12 to 18 months. So much money is going to flow into their equities. It's going to your head is going to be spinning. Um they're they they basically want to get tap into that 20 trillion plus of household savings which is on the side sidelines which would put quite a few dollars in the hands of Alibaba.\n\nof the COVID lows people are more pessimistic than then uh which was unbelievable buying opportunity number two record rotation out of US stocks falling to a net 23% underweight.

I have to verify that. It's why I took it out of the article, but uh it doesn't surprise me at all. They're the leader in e-commerce and the percentage of commerce that goes through E is at the highest uh in China out of any other developed country. Uh Crown Castle update, they sold that off, which is huge. They're now going to use that cash to buy back. You can see cash flow has been great. Stock has been down. Why? Because they had a low return on investor capital on the fiber business was a drag. losing money and now they got rid of it and they got $8.5 billion to boot. So, expect them to bring in the share account to invest in more uh capex light towers like their 40,000 leg legacy which are cash machines and the stock goes up. So, those of you who listened and locked in the seven or eight% dividend yield now are going to see uh from those levels probably doubles over the next few years on top of collecting 7% a year, which is uh great.

Okay. And uh\n### FEATURED_COMPANY_DEEP_DIVES\nmoving along , we've got uh oh yeah, I want to cover ASOS real quick. You can read all that stuff on your own. Okay, so ASOS, while this has been a tiny position for us, we've consistently been on alert for new information that would warrant making it at least a half-sized position or even a full-size position. We have yet to be impressed. Our instincts about whether a quote consultant could make a good CEO have thus far been proven correct. A lot of talk and not enough action. We hope we are proven wrong and will upsize if he starts to deliver. We do believe this is an incredible business that has huge upside potential. We don't know if they have the right leader in place or not. Uh you know, free cash flow is certainly starting to improve. That's a positive thing. He hasn't turned revenues yet. He has a strategy for that. We shall see it. you know, I'd really rather have a guy like Bracken who has experience with brands, uh, a lot of expertise in doing that. But, uh, this one, you know, takes a little time. I think they're in a decent enough position. They've got a decent enough runway. It'll be good. And, uh, at any week we could be getting on and saying, \"Okay, I see the light at the end of the tunnel. Let's make it a real position.\" But, we're just simply not there yet. Uh, I'm very skeptical about this. I I have been, but we very rarely ever do a mini position. It's either going to be a full position or it's going to be nothing. But this one had all the makings of a perfect turnaround situation. I still think it does. I hope this guy can execute on it. If he can't, I think there's plenty of runway they could get someone else in there that who who can. Uh but there's no reason yet to make it a real position. And uh we'll leave it at that. Um,\n### MISCELLANEOUS\nokay. Congratulations to all the new clients that came in through our during our 2024 and Q1 2025 raises. You could not be better positioned for what we believe will continue to be a highly rewarding year in 2025. Not many people can say that this year, which is surprise, which is surprising to us because it was pretty clear what you had to do coming into 2025, which we told every single week. Lighten up on Mag 7. I mean, we we sounded like a broken record. Um producers would be like again the same message international. Yeah, again the same message. Um this view is based on what has already taken place in 2025 as well as the data we've shared in recent weeks on our podcast videocast coupled with our proprietary methods of expressing and executing upon those ideas on your behalf. The waitings, the derivative overlays. I mean, the secret what goes beyond what goes on on behalf of the clients is stuff that uh you can't reverse engineer from listening to the podcast. But if all you did is buy the names, uh you know, you're doing great and we're very very appreciative of uh um the names that we've made public. Uh you guys doing a great job and uh and all the kind notes that we've been getting. Um so we will reopen on April 1st. We are taking having the conversations getting people's paperwork processed before that and we'll deploy uh starting uh April 1st. You can go to the website at hedge funfundtips.com click on money management or just the article the week click there and uh we'll be in touch. Uh consumer discretionary top 30 weights earnings are actually down 1.8% 8% in the last 60 days and for next year down 93 basis points. So again, we're still in sandbagger season where they take estimates down the first quarter and then they beat all year and take them up. 2026 estimates have not come down surprisingly. So it's all backend loaded as it is every year. Same thing with Staples. Same exact story. That just creates opportunity for people like us. um and you and uh let's see if there's any major stuff that we wanted to cover here as it relates to economic data. Uh nothing that stands out this week. Earnings came down from 275 to 271. That's held static. And",
    "MISCELLANEOUS": "\n\nI think S&P 15.1 uh million production. But if you just step back when these cycles peaked, whether it was in 2005, 2017, 1987, all between 18 and 20 for for short periods of the spikes. You know, in the 80s, our population, the census was 226 million people. Now we&#39;re at 331 million people. So, uh, it it, you know, we&#39;re just looking for that 16 to 18 or 17 to 18, but on the basis of population and the age of our population with so many people being 34, 35 when they buy new cars, um, I think we could wind up getting surprised dramatically to the upside. But that&#39;s just the whipped cream. We&#39;re we&#39;re dealing with basease scenarios. So, now that we&#39;ve gone through an apocalyptic scenario, Jeff, let&#39;s um go uh go through what it looks like uh for every cycle for the past 40 years when we peak between 17 to 18 million in production.\n### MISCELLANEOUS\nLet&#39;s call it 17.5 million round numbers. By my calculation, CPS had approximately $99 in revenue for every vehicle produced in North America in 2024 on a simple average basis. So, you know, round numbers, uh, let&#39;s call it 190 a carish for servicing half of the total cars, but let&#39;s just do it simply, 99 a car at a more historically normalized 17.5 million peak production or 2 million more vehicles than last year. uh you would expect to gain nearly 200 million of additional revenue considering this is an operating leverage play and your break even is call it 15 to 15 and a half production free cash flow positive with most fixed costs in place we expect most of the incremental uh production to go to the bottom line at a higher uh VCM of approximately 35% this would be approximately 70 million in incremental profit or nearly four to $5 of $4 of additional EPS over our $5 to $6 EPS base case. I mean, round numbers at peak cycle production if it&#39;s 17.59 $10 a share in EPS base case from our side, not you know I I I know I know the position you&#39;re in. Uh this is re is this a reasonable not guaranteed in any way uh or any guidance way to think about it? In other words, if you were to say, &quot;Uh, Tom, look, I can&#39;t guarantee that, but your ar your argument is flawed here, here, and here.&quot; Uh, do you you can you legitimately say your my argument is flawed in that way of thinking about it if volumes normalize the way they have going back every single cycle for the last 40 years. And also uh not even accounting for the fact that the population uh was 32% lower in the 1980s. Yeah. First, I agree with your premise. Let&#39;s let&#39;s say it that way in in terms of uh the demand. We believe that that t\n\n### MEDIA_APPEARANCE_RECAP\nmoving along , want to thank Jake Mack and Taylor Riggs for having me on the Clayman Countdown Fox Business. This week, we got to discuss, uh, two of my favorite companies, Alibaba and Lip Booan for Intel. Listen in here. But are markets, at least today, looking through the data and focusing on the fundamentals of some of these companies, which do indeed remain strong. Joining us now, I&#39;m pleased to say, region&#39;s chief investment officer Alan Mcnite and Great Hill Capital Chairman Thomas Hayes.\n### QUOTES_OF_THE_WEEK\nWell, Taylor, I think Warren Buffett said it best. Be greedy when others are fearful. And every single fear indicator is completely washed out. The AI sentiment showed just 19% of retail investors were bullish last week. They bought record puts after the market was down. you want to buy that house insurance before the fire. Uh and hedge funds were record selling stocks in the hole. These are all contrarian indicators and this is when we look for opportunities. We&#39;re seeing the Fed put back in play for June. 82% chance of a cut in June.\n### MISCELLANEOUS\nAnd we&#39;re seeing utilities and AI play still. It is. And I think that&#39;s where utilities is now a growth name. And if you had told me 10 years ago I would buy utilities for the growth, I would have said you&#39;re crazy. But today you look at the type of growth they can generate because of data center growth, because of AI that is fueling that data center growth. And suddenly you&#39;re really seeing an opportunity there, particularly in the southeast part of the country where you&#39;re seeing continued population demand as well.\n### FEATURED_COMPANY_DEEP_DIVES\nTom, um I&#39;m not calling you crazy, but a lot of people might call you crazy when I look and one of your top picks right now is Intel. This is a great storied American company. They just announced, I believe on Friday, a new CEO, but this is a company that has struggled. Why Intel? And why Intel at $25? Well, Taylor Lip Bhutan is the new CEO. He came from Cadence Designs when the stock was down 86% in 2009. If you had invested $1 million when he became CEO, by the time he stepped down 14 years later in 2023, that $1 million became $68 million. Lip Bhutan is a miracle worker and Intel needs a miracle and I think they&#39;re going to get it. You know, the key thing\n\n### FEATURED_COMPANY_DEEP_DIVES\nNvidia&#39;s growth rate has decelerated, not for lack of demand, but for lack of supply. TSMC is at capacity. Intel in the background has been building up the fabs. They&#39;re ready for prime time. Nvidia&#39;s testing chips. Broadcom is testing chips. And Lip Bhutan is going to spike the football in the end zone. We&#39;re very excited about Intel. And it&#39;s trading just a couple bucks over tangible book value. So, if they liquidated the whole company today, you get most of your money back. And if he does what he could do, which we know he can, it could be a double and beyond in the next 12 to 24 months. But Tom, a lot of people are thinking that Intel I mean I&#39;ve heard um you know not rumors but you know words used like they&#39;re selling the car for parts, right? Where you had rumors about Broadcom, TSMC coming and looking at different portions of the business. Do you like it as a sum of the whole or do you like it as different parts? Look, if they sell it off for parts, we probably get 3540 bucks when all is said and done. Lit Bhutan has stated he&#39;s going to run this business. He&#39;s not interested in a fire sale. He&#39;s going to turn this into a multibagger. Everything is there. Actually, Gellzinger did lay the found foundry uh uh framework to move ahead and to supply the Nvidia and the Broadcoms of the world. Lip Bhan is going to finish that execution at the five yard line, take it in for a touchdown. This is going to be, look, it was on no one&#39;s bingo card at the beginning of this year that Nvidia would be among the worst chip producers this year in terms of performers. And Intel is now the top performing semiconductor company for year-to- date 2025. Okay. I think people might say that says more about Nvidia than it does about Intel. We&#39;ll see. But Tom, I do like the bull call. \n\nYeah, I look, we continue to like China and people said we were crazy when we were buying Alibaba in the 90s, in the 80s, in the 60s. Now it&#39;s over 145, going to over 200 over the next 12 to 24 months. I&#39;m telling you, Intel is going to be the exact same way, Taylor. They&#39;re calling me crazy now. when it&#39;s at 40 50 60 they&#39;re gonna say wow you know it&#39;s is it time to buy at 60 and I&#39;m gonna say yeah it&#39;s probably going higher lip banan is a miracle worker why don&#39;t we make crazy good again sometimes my husband calls me a little crazy and look I didn&#39;t turn out so bad so maybe a little crazy isn&#39;t so bad really appreciate both of you Alan Mcnite and Thomas Hayes please come back and join me thank you Taylor mean and we&#39;re back and then I got to join uh uh two incredible, well, three incredible people on the Money Show podcast this week. I want to thank Mike Larson for having me on. As always, my buddy Kenny Pulcari and Jim Bianco, who is a bond expert uh and macroeconomic expert was great to be on with the three of them.\n\n### MEDIA_APPEARANCE_RECAP\nWell, I think this is pretty standard, Mike. This is what we see pretty much every four years, uh, post-election year. You see some weakness in February through mid-Marchch and then you start to find a bottom. And why why is that pretty uniform going back, you know, hundred something years is because uh people want to get a sense of what the policy is. And it doesn&#39;t have to be good policy. It just needs to be known policy. And I think that&#39;s what we&#39;re grappling with uh with Trump right now. But I like I I say to many people, welcome to Trump 2.0. Same as Trump 1.0. New day, new headline, new tweet, new volatility resolves higher over time. Uh and what I like what we saw last week is uh a big flush out. You know, record selling by hedge funds. Uh that&#39;s a contrarian indicator. Uh a lot of momentum followers there. Overlever retail uh investors bought record insurance, record put buying after the house was already burned down. You want to buy those insurance premiums before the fire starts. Uh so you can&#39;t make that up. Then you had the largest drop in US equity allocation on record in the Bank of America fund manager survey. uh which we saw this week. So I I think I think we&#39;re finding a a situation where we can go in and buy stocks. Uh as for the MAG 7, you know, at your events towards the end of the year, I was saying the theme was going to be a shift out of the Mag 7 into the unmagnificent 493 and more importantly into into international. That&#39;s played out uh as anticipated. We think that theme will continue. And Mag 7, you got to look at two things. Number one, one thing no one&#39;s paying attention to that I&#39;ve seen is the Japanese carry trade unwind. Okay? And all you need to do is look at 10-year JGBs and what you see what used to be free hot money now has a cost. 10-year JGB yields are at 20ear highs. Those have continued to creep up aggressively in the last four weeks. And as a result, the most impacted part of the market has been the MAG 7 where all that hot money has been parked. So, I do think that yes, we are due for a technical bounce. Uh, maybe MAG 7 will trade back up to the top of the range, but I think the theme for 2025 will continue. MAG 7 will underperform relative to 493 and dramatically underperform relative to international as we&#39;ve seen. Y, thanks Tom. Let me a little bit. I mean, you&#39;ve talked international, you mentioned Alibaba. Is there anything else that that particularly excites you now? I know you&#39;ve talked about some names at our past events, but we&#39;re getting towards the end of Q1, so I figured I&#39;d uh I&#39;d see if there&#39;s anything new that&#39;s on your radar screen. Look, I I think uh Intel is the most underrated story. If they liquidated the whole damn thing today, you&#39;d probably get about 22 23 bucks. It&#39;s trading at 25. Lip Banan uh was at Cadence Designs, which makes the software for all of these chip designers. Lip Bhutan became CEO of Cadence Designs in January 2009 after the stock was down 86%. If you&#39;d put a million dollars with this guy, uh by the time he stepped down as executive chairman 14 years later in 2023, that $1 million became $68 million. 68 bagger. This guy is a miracle worker. Intel needs a miracle. he&#39;s going to deliver and he&#39;s not interested in partnerships or selling it off for parts. He&#39;s going to run this thing up the flag pole. And here&#39;s the thing, Nvidia is not down because of lack of demand. Nvidia is down because of lack of supply. TSMC is at capacity and only gives them $4 billion of revenue growth per quarter, which on a bigger base decelerates the revenue growth from 250% down to probably 30 40% by the end of this year. They need capacity. TSMC could say, &quot;Yes, Mr. Trump, we&#39;re going to invest a trillion dollars in the United States.&quot; The problem is it&#39;s going to take them four to five years to get to where Intel is with their fabs today. So, love Gellzinger or hate him, he did one thing over the last four years. He set Intel up for success. And Lip Bhan is going to come in and spike the football in the end zone as uh these this chip production comes on on board. Right now, Nvidia and Broadcom are testing their chip in Intel&#39;s US fabs. And from what we have gotten back through media, it&#39;s going quite well. This game is just be beginning for Intel for everyone saying, &quot;Oh, Intel&#39;s going out of business.&quot; I mean, give me a break. They&#39;ve done over $50 billion of revenue in the last 12 months being completely mismanaged. And now you got someone who can who can ride this horse to the promised land, and we&#39;re getting on with them. Yeah. As an old school person, you know, all I can do is reminisce about the Winel days, right? Why we only have a couple minutes left. I want to make sure just for anybody watching, uh Jim is going to be joining us in Dallas and Miami. Uh Tom and Kenny are going to be joining us at the Miami Symposium in May. Guys, if you have maybe 30 45 seconds to just give a preview preview of what you you think you&#39;re going to be talking about. Tom, maybe I&#39;ll go to you first and uh let you do that now. Yeah. I think one of my segments is going to be how the uninvestable became investable while we were building up our Baba position. and everyone said it&#39;s uninvestable. It&#39;s uninvestable. It&#39;s uninvestable. We&#39;re going to talk about kind of market sentiment that goes into that, how you can see through the noise, look under the cover, uh follow the fundamentals. In the short term, the market is a voting machine based on emotions like you saw in the last two years in China. In the long term, it&#39;s a weighing machine based on fundamentals like you&#39;re seeing right now. Uh and then we&#39;re going to talk about some uh in the second segment, some year-end picks, year-end outlook. A lot of opportunities to make money in the second half of this year. So, we&#39;re really excited to go down to Miami and deliver a lot of value.\n\n### MISCELLANEOUS\nAnd we&#39;re back. And uh and this is the event that Mike and I referenced in the Money Show interview. I&#39;ll be speaking at the Money Show in Miami. The event is from the 15th through the 17th. My two segments are on Saturday the 17th before I fly to go see my friends in Dubai. Uh looking forward to that. So you can register either at the money show website miamimmms.com or go to hedge funips.com and just put Miami in the search bar and this will come up and you can register there. Uh then I had a chance to join Diego on um CGTN America. Want to thank Diego and Chamellia Kilawan for having me on. This was about Tesla and Elon Musk. You can go ahead and watch that at hedgefundtips.com. And I want to thank Yahoo Naomi Buchanan for including me in her in her article on Yahoo Finance about the carry trade. And now our\n\nhere is a statistic out of there where 40% of Chinese consumption goes through Alibaba which is unbelievable. I have to verify that. It's why I took it out of the article, but uh it doesn't surprise me at all. They're the leader in e-commerce and the percentage of commerce that goes through E is at the highest uh in China out of any other developed country. Uh Crown Castle update, they sold that off, which is huge. They're now going to use that cash to buy back. You can see cash flow has been great. Stock has been down. Why? Because they had a low return on investor capital on the fiber business was a drag. losing money and now they got rid of it and they got $8.5 billion to boot. So, expect them to bring in the share account to invest in more uh capex light towers like their 40,000 leg legacy which are cash machines and the stock goes up. So, those of you who listened and locked in the seven or eight% dividend yield now are going to see uh from those levels probably doubles over the next few years on top of collecting 7% a year, which is uh great. Okay. And uh\n### FEATURED_COMPANY_DEEP_DIVES\nmoving along , we've got uh oh yeah, I want to cover ASOS real quick. You can read all that stuff on your own. Okay, so ASOS, while this has been a tiny position for us, we've consistently been on alert for new information that would warrant making it at least a half-sized position or even a full-size position. We have yet to be impressed. Our instincts about whether a quote consultant could make a good CEO have thus far been proven correct. A lot of talk and not enough action. We hope we are proven wrong and will upsize if he starts to deliver. We do believe this is an incredible business that has huge upside potential. We don't know if they have the right leader in place or not. Uh you know, free cash flow is certainly starting to improve. That's a positive thing. He hasn't turned revenues yet. He has a strategy for that. We shall see it. you know, I'd really rather have a guy like Bracken who has experience with brands, uh, a lot of expertise in doing that. But, uh, this one, you know, takes a little time. I think they're in a decent enough position. They've got a decent enough runway. It'll be good. And, uh, at any week we could be getting on and saying, \"Okay, I see the light at the end of the tunnel. Let's make it a real position.\" But, we're just simply not there yet. Uh, I'm very skeptical about this. I I have been, but we very rarely ever do a mini position. It's either going to be a full position or it's going to be nothing. But this one had all the makings of a perfect turnaround situation. I still think it does. I hope this guy can execute on it. If he can't, I think there's plenty of runway they could get someone else in there that who who can. Uh but there's no reason yet to make it a real position. And uh we'll leave it at that. Um,\n### MISCELLANEOUS\nokay. Congratulations to all the new clients that came in through our during our 2024 and Q1 2025 raises. You could not be better positioned for what we believe will continue to be a highly rewarding year in 2025. Not many people can say that this year, which is surprise, which is surprising to us because it was pretty clear what you had to do coming into 2025, which we told every single week. Lighten up on Mag 7. I mean, we we sounded like a broken record. Um producers would be like again the same message international. Yeah, again the same message. Um this view is based on what has already taken place in 2025 as well as the data we've shared in recent weeks on our podcast videocast coupled with our proprietary methods of expressing and executing upon those ideas on your behalf. The waitings, the derivative overlays. I mean, the secret what goes beyond what goes on on behalf of the clients is stuff that uh you can't reverse engineer from listening to the podcast. But if all you did is buy the names, uh you know, you're doing great and we're very very appreciative of uh um the names that we've made public. Uh you guys doing a great job and uh and all the kind notes that we've been getting. Um so we will reopen on April 1st. We are taking having the conversations getting people's paperwork processed before that and we'll deploy uh starting uh April 1st. You can go to the website at hedge funfundtips.com click on money management or just the article the week click there and uh we'll be in touch. Uh consumer discretionary top 30 weights earnings are actually down 1.8% 8% in the last 60 days and for next year down 93 basis points. So again, we're still in sandbagger season where they take estimates down the first quarter and then they beat all year and take them up. 2026 estimates have not come down surprisingly. So it's all backend loaded as it is every year. Same thing with Staples. Same exact story. That just creates opportunity for people like us. um and you and uh let's see if there's any major stuff that we wanted to cover here as it relates to economic data. Uh nothing that stands out this week. Earnings came down from 275 to 271. That's held static. And\n\nLighten up on Mag 7. I mean, we we sounded like a broken record.

    "### FEATURED_COMPANY_DEEP_DIVES": "\n\nwhen Nvidia was trading at $152, uh everyone said, \"What are you doing for AI?\" I said, \"I'm doing this company called Commtock Resources. They they're a natural gas play and it was $8 and change. Now it's up close to $20.\" And then people were like, \"No, really? What are you doing about AI?\" I was like, \"Well, I'm doing this thing called Alibaba. It was under well under a hundred bucks. Now it's 145 going to 200. It may be that Cooper Standard is going to be the AI play of 2025 with everything going on. But leaving that aside, here's the first question from Grock. Uh suggested that I ask you. Again, all of this is opinion, not advice. This is not recommendations. Talk to your financial advisor. This is not guidance. This is a conversation. Uh so here's what Grock says. Jeff, if you were an investor or or if if you were an investor with $1 million to deploy, why would you put it all into Cooper Standard stock right now? Now, we would never recommend anyone puts 100% of anything into one stock, but uh but that's the question. So, give us uh some guidelines here, Jeff. Yeah, as I mentioned in the conversation, Tom, I mean, because we've taken care of our own business, right? We've over the last 5 years, we've established a cost base that allows the company to flourish. Uh we've already put enough points on the scoreboard to tell you that by the end of 2025, we're going to be at double digit EBDA and we're going to be at double digit return on invested capital. And then when we forecast and just look out a few years from that point, uh we've said that our net leverage is going to be uh two times or less. All of those statements are on the volumes that exist today and a very slight increase in forecast over the course of the next three years. Uh so if I would look at that and and I would be an investor, I would say, \"Wow, there's a company that's delivering results. There's a company that that has uh told us that the that they're going to return to the type of prosperity that they exist that existed back in the 2017 period of time that you mentioned earlier was $140 stock price. I'm not predicting that. I'm just telling you that I I know what that feels like and I know what it feels like today and I know what the industry pent up demand is for the next three or four years. So with that, uh, it's pretty tough to find, I think, a company in an industry that's better positioned than than what we are. Love it. And, uh, this one is is also from Grock, and it's interesting that they mentioned Warren Buffett because, uh, I look up to him a lot. A lot of our framework is similar. Uh, if you had to pitch Cooper Standard to Warren Buffett, what's the number one metric you'd want to prove this is a cash machine worth owning? I think we talked about this. Uh I own over 350,000 shares of Cooper Standard stock. Uh that's about 2% of the company. Uh so that's I think putting my uh money where my mouth is. And it also uh for me is probably the most important metric. And I I can I could talk to you about all the other company metrics, but I'll just stick to that personal one. I love it. I love it. And final question, Jeff, is there anything else we didn't cover that you'd like to share with our audience of investors today? I think we've covered it all. I just I'm I'm excited about the future. I'm excited about Cooper Standard. I mean, we have great employees. We've talked a lot about our product. We haven't talked much about our culture today. But it isn't just the what we make, it's how we do it. And and I'm so proud of the uh of the 21,000 employees that call this home. And we don't have a lot of turnover. Uh we have great people. It's not the sign on the building that makes us Tom. It's the people within the buildings. And and I'm really proud of that fact. So that's how I would end it. Thank you very much for the conversation. Well, well, thank you so much for joining us. Very grateful for you taking the time. That's chairman and CEO of Cooper Standard, Jeff Edwards.\n\nAlibaba revenues have risen steadily as profits have recovered from its recent dip. So you can see here from 2021 till now even in the most difficult operating environment now that they&#39;ve got the governmental tailwinds behind them the AI tailwinds and all the other amazing things toll taker with domestic consumption uh as a focus of the government they&#39;re just going to mint money. Alibaba&#39;s capex is going up. They&#39;ve they&#39;ve got 80 billion of cash. China unveils plan to vigorously boost weak consumption. Alibaba is the number one toll taker for the middle and upper class spending in China. Teimu sells garbage at the low end, which did okay for a couple years when they were in lockdown and everyone felt poor, but as things recover, uh Alibaba is going to whip their butts. Hong Kong stocks hit three-year highs on Trump talks could ease trade trade tensions. Trump is going to be having a meeting with Xi. Alibaba and other Chinese stocks are crushing US shares. Alibaba has been going straight up and she told everyone to get out of it. Baba is the key toll taker with Tao and T-Mol. All of this is benefiting Cooper Standard. Intel is the best chip stock this year in a surprising reversal. I went on Charles Payne last year when Nvidia was $153 and I said to sell Nvidia and buy Intel and after that he didn&#39;t invite me on the show for three months. Dell CEO explains why he thinks the PC refresh cycle is starting. That&#39;s who who&#39;s the number one beneficiary of the P PC refresh uh uh is Intel.

    "MEDIA_APPEARANCE_RECAP": "\n\n### MEDIA_APPEARANCE_RECAP\nmoving along , want to thank Jake Mack and Taylor Riggs for having me on the Clayman Countdown Fox Business. This week, we got to discuss, uh, two of my favorite companies, Alibaba and Lip Booan for Intel. Listen in here. But are markets, at least today, looking through the data and focusing on the fundamentals of some of these companies, which do indeed remain strong. Joining us now, I&#39;m pleased to say, region&#39;s chief investment officer Alan Mcnite and Great Hill Capital Chairman Thomas Hayes.\n### QUOTES_OF_THE_WEEK\nWell, Taylor, I think Warren Buffett said it best. Be greedy when others are fearful. And every single fear indicator is completely washed out. The AI sentiment showed just 19% of retail investors were bullish last week. They bought record puts after the market was down. you want to buy that house insurance before the fire. Uh and hedge funds were record selling stocks in the hole. These are all contrarian indicators and this is when we look for opportunities. We&#39;re seeing the Fed put back in play for June. 82% chance of a cut in June.\n### MISCELLANEOUS\nAnd we&#39;re seeing utilities and AI play still. It is. And I think that&#39;s where utilities is now a growth name. And if you had told me 10 years ago I would buy utilities for the growth, I would have said you&#39;re crazy. But today you look at the type of growth they can generate because of data center growth, because of AI that is fueling that data center growth. And suddenly you&#39;re really seeing an opportunity there, particularly in the southeast part of the country where you&#39;re seeing continued population demand as well.\n### FEATURED_COMPANY_DEEP_DIVES\nTom, um I&#39;m not calling you crazy, but a lot of people might call you crazy when I look and one of your top picks right now is Intel. This is a great storied American company. They just announced, I believe on Friday, a new CEO, but this is a company that has struggled. Why Intel? And why Intel at $25? Well, Taylor Lip Bhutan is the new CEO. He came from Cadence Designs when the stock was down 86% in 2009. If you had invested $1 million when he became CEO, by the time he stepped down 14 years later in 2023, that $1 million became $68 million. Lip Bhutan is a miracle worker and Intel needs a miracle and I think they&#39;re going to get it. You know, the key thing\n\n### MEDIA_APPEARANCE_RECAP\nlast week were getting a little nervous like, \"Oh my gosh, is the bottom here? Is there more room to run?\" But on the other hand, people are like, \"Look, everything is 10% on sale now. And if I liked a sweater at 100, I like it even more at 90.\" we still think communication services, we think utilities look cheap here, and it's all about the earnings. And I think we're going to see as we get into first quarter earning season, if you can continue to buy companies that are delivering earnings in excess of 10 15% growth, it pays to go shopping when things are on sale. And we're seeing utilities and AI play still. And I think that's where utilities is now a growth name. And if you had told me 10 years ago I would buy utilities for the growth, I would have said you're crazy. But today you look at the type of growth they can generate because of data center growth, because of AI that is fueling that data center growth.

Lip Bhutan is a miracle worker and Intel needs a miracle and I think they're going to get it. You know, the key thing here is\n\n### FEATURED_COMPANY_DEEP_DIVES\nNvidia&#39;s growth rate has decelerated, not for lack of demand, but for lack of supply. TSMC is at capacity. Intel in the background has been building up the fabs. They&#39;re ready for prime time. Nvidia&#39;s testing chips. Broadcom is testing chips. And Lip Bhutan is going to spike the football in the end zone. We&#39;re very excited about Intel. And it&#39;s trading just a couple bucks over tangible book value. So, if they liquidated the whole company today, you get most of your money back. And if he does what he could do, which we know he can, it could be a double and beyond in the next 12 to 24 months. But Tom, a lot of people are thinking that Intel I mean I&#39;ve heard um you know not rumors but you know words used like they&#39;re selling the car for parts, right? Where you had rumors about Broadcom, TSMC coming and looking at different portions of the business. Do you like it as a sum of the whole or do you like it as different parts? Look, if they sell it off for parts, we probably get 3540 bucks when all is said and done. Lit Bhutan has stated he&#39;s going to run this business. He&#39;s not interested in a fire sale. He&#39;s going to turn this into a multibagger. Everything is there. Actually, Gellzinger did lay the found foundry uh uh framework to move ahead and to supply the Nvidia and the Broadcoms of the world. Lip Bhan is going to finish that execution at the five yard line, take it in for a touchdown. This is going to be, look, it was on no one&#39;s bingo card at the beginning of this year that Nvidia would be among the worst chip producers this year in terms of performers. And Intel is now the top performing semiconductor company for year-to- date 2025. Okay. I think people might say that says more about Nvidia than it does about Intel. We&#39;ll see. But Tom, I do like the bull call. \n\nYeah, I look, we continue to like China and people said we were crazy when we were buying Alibaba in the 90s, in the 80s, in the 60s. Now it&#39;s over 145, going to over 200 over the next 12 to 24 months. I&#39;m telling you, Intel is going to be the exact same way, Taylor. They&#39;re calling me crazy now. when it&#39;s at 40 50 60 they&#39;re gonna say wow you know it&#39;s is it time to buy at 60 and I&#39;m gonna say yeah it&#39;s probably going higher lip banan is a miracle worker why don&#39;t we make crazy good again sometimes my husband calls me a little crazy and look I didn&#39;t turn out so bad so maybe a little crazy isn&#39;t so bad really appreciate both of you Alan Mcnite and Thomas Hayes please come back and join me thank you Taylor mean and we&#39;re back and then I got to join uh uh two incredible, well, three incredible people on the Money Show podcast this week. I want to thank Mike Larson for having me on. As always, my buddy Kenny Pulcari and Jim Bianco, who is a bond expert uh and macroeconomic expert was great to be on with the three of them.\n\n### MEDIA_APPEARANCE_RECAP\nWell, I think this is pretty standard, Mike. This is what we see pretty much every four years, uh, post-election year. You see some weakness in February through mid-Marchch and then you start to find a bottom. And why why is that pretty uniform going back, you know, hundred something years is because uh people want to get a sense of what the policy is. And it doesn&#39;t have to be good policy. It just needs to be known policy. And I think that&#39;s what we&#39;re grappling with uh with Trump right now. But I like I I say to many people, welcome to Trump 2.0. Same as Trump 1.0. New day, new headline, new tweet, new volatility resolves higher over time. Uh and what I like what we saw last week is uh a big flush out. You know, record selling by hedge funds. Uh that&#39;s a contrarian indicator. Uh a lot of momentum followers there. Overlever retail uh investors bought record insurance, record put buying after the house was already burned down. You want to buy those insurance premiums before the fire starts. Uh so you can&#39;t make that up. Then you had the largest drop in US equity allocation on record in the Bank of America fund manager survey. uh which we saw this week. So I I think I think we&#39;re finding a a situation where we can go in and buy stocks. Uh as for the MAG 7, you know, at your events towards the end of the year, I was saying the theme was going to be a shift out of the Mag 7 into the unmagnificent 493 and more importantly into into international. That&#39;s played out uh as anticipated. We think that theme will continue. And Mag 7, you got to look at two things. Number one, one thing no one&#39;s paying attention to that I&#39;ve seen is the Japanese carry trade unwind. Okay? And all you need to do is look at 10-year JGBs and what you see what used to be free hot money now has a cost. 10-year JGB yields are at 20ear highs. Those have continued to creep up aggressively in the last four weeks. And as a result, the most impacted part of the market has been the MAG 7 where all that hot money has been parked. So, I do think that yes, we are due for a technical bounce. Uh, maybe MAG 7 will trade back up to the top of the range, but I think the theme for 2025 will continue. MAG 7 will underperform relative to 493 and dramatically underperform relative to international as we&#39;ve seen. Y, thanks Tom. Let me a little bit. I mean, you&#39;ve talked international, you mentioned Alibaba. Is there anything else that that particularly excites you now? I know you&#39;ve talked about some names at our past events, but we&#39;re getting towards the end of Q1, so I figured I&#39;d uh I&#39;d see if there&#39;s anything new that&#39;s on your radar screen. Look, I I think uh Intel is the most underrated story. If they liquidated the whole damn thing today, you&#39;d probably get about 22 23 bucks. It&#39;s trading at 25. Lip Banan uh was at Cadence Designs, which makes the software for all of these chip designers. Lip Bhutan became CEO of Cadence Designs in January 2009 after the stock was down 86%. If you&#39;d put a million dollars with this guy, uh by the time he stepped down as executive chairman 14 years later in 2023, that $1 million became $68 million. 68 bagger. This guy is a miracle worker. Intel needs a miracle. he&#39;s going to deliver and he&#39;s not interested in partnerships or selling it off for parts. He&#39;s going to run this thing up the flag pole. And here&#39;s the thing, Nvidia is not down because of lack of demand. Nvidia is down because of lack of supply. TSMC is at capacity and only gives them $4 billion of revenue growth per quarter, which on a bigger base decelerates the revenue growth from 250% down to probably 30 40% by the end of this year. They need capacity. TSMC could say, &quot;Yes, Mr. Trump, we&#39;re going to invest a trillion dollars in the United States.&quot; The problem is it&#39;s going to take them four to five years to get to where Intel is with their fabs today. So, love Gellzinger or hate him, he did one thing over the last four years. He set Intel up for success. And Lip Bhan is going to come in and spike the football in the end zone as uh these this chip production comes on on board. Right now, Nvidia and Broadcom are testing their chip in Intel&#39;s US fabs. And from what we have gotten back through media, it&#39;s going quite well. This game is just be beginning for Intel for everyone saying, &quot;Oh, Intel&#39;s going out of business.&quot; I mean, give me a break. They&#39;ve done over $50 billion of revenue in the last 12 months being completely mismanaged. And now you got someone who can who can ride this horse to the promised land, and we&#39;re getting on with them. Yeah. As an old school person, you know, all I can do is reminisce about the Winel days, right? Why we only have a couple minutes left. I want to make sure just for anybody watching, uh Jim is going to be joining us in Dallas and Miami. Uh Tom and Kenny are going to be joining us at the Miami Symposium in May. Guys, if you have maybe 30 45 seconds to just give a preview preview of what you you think you&#39;re going to be talking about. Tom, maybe I&#39;ll go to you first and uh let you do that now. Yeah. I think one of my segments is going to be how the uninvestable became investable while we were building up our Baba position. and everyone said it&#39;s uninvestable. It&#39;s uninvestable. It&#39;s uninvestable. We&#39;re going to talk about kind of market sentiment that goes into that, how you can see through the noise, look under the cover, uh follow the fundamentals. In the short term, the market is a voting machine based on emotions like you saw in the last two years in China. In the long term, it&#39;s a weighing machine based on fundamentals like you&#39;re seeing right now. Uh and then we&#39;re going to talk about some uh in the second segment, some year-end picks, year-end outlook. A lot of opportunities to make money in the second half of this year. So, we&#39;re really excited to go down to Miami and deliver a lot of value.\n\n### MISCELLANEOUS\nAnd we&#39;re back. And uh and this is the event that Mike and I referenced in the Money Show interview. I&#39;ll be speaking at the Money Show in Miami. The event is from the 15th through the 17th. My two segments are on Saturday the 17th before I fly to go see my friends in Dubai. Uh looking forward to that. So you can register either at the money show website miamimmms.com or go to hedge funips.com and just put Miami in the search bar and this will come up and you can register there. Uh then I had a chance to join Diego on um CGTN America. Want to thank Diego and Chamellia Kilawan for having me on. This was about Tesla and Elon Musk. You can go ahead and watch that at hedgefundtips.com. And I want to thank Yahoo Naomi Buchanan for including me in her in her article on Yahoo Finance about the carry trade. And now our\n\n### MEDIA_APPEARANCE_RECAP\nI think one of my segments is going to be how the uninvestable became investable while we were building up our Baba position. and everyone said it's uninvestable. It's uninvestable. It's uninvestable. We're going to talk about kind of market sentiment that goes into that, how you can see through the noise, look under the cover, uh follow the fundamentals. In the short term, the market is a voting machine based on emotions like you saw in the last two years in China. In the long term, it's a weighing machine based on fundamentals like you're seeing right now.\n\n### QUOTES_OF_THE_WEEK\nwe've just had an exciting period of time between what's going on with uh Alibaba and some of the others. And you know, it's interesting as it relates to Cooper Standard and I had a number of comments, you know, uh today like the they really enjoyed the uh CEO interview and and everything else. And I said, \"Look, you know, $2 down or $2 up really doesn't matter. The key is how we're positioned for the long-term story.\" And Cooper Standard couldn't be better positioned. And nothing has changed either really in the information, although the information's gotten a little bit better than our original thesis than um than when we originally got involved in May of 2022. It's just now all the things that we said were going to happen when no one believed it are now starting to happen and people are starting to get excited. And I think it's it's literally the early days of the early days. And when this thing turns, it turns all at once just like we saw with Alibaba. It takes years then it happens all at once just like we saw with many many others throughout the years of this podcast. So this is a very important thing.",
    "QUOTES_OF_THE_WEEK": "\n\n### MEDIA_APPEARANCE_RECAP\nmoving along , want to thank Jake Mack and Taylor Riggs for having me on the Clayman Countdown Fox Business. This week, we got to discuss, uh, two of my favorite companies, Alibaba and Lip Booan for Intel. Listen in here. But are markets, at least today, looking through the data and focusing on the fundamentals of some of these companies, which do indeed remain strong. Joining us now, I&#39;m pleased to say, region&#39;s chief investment officer Alan Mcnite and Great Hill Capital Chairman Thomas Hayes.\n### QUOTES_OF_THE_WEEK\nWell, Taylor, I think Warren Buffett said it best. Be greedy when others are fearful. And every single fear indicator is completely washed out. The AI sentiment showed just 19% of retail investors were bullish last week. They bought record puts after the market was down. you want to buy that house insurance before the fire. Uh and hedge funds were record selling stocks in the hole. These are all contrarian indicators and this is when we look for opportunities. We&#39;re seeing the Fed put back in play for June. 82% chance of a cut in June.\n### MISCELLANEOUS\nAnd we&#39;re seeing utilities and AI play still. It is. And I think that&#39;s where utilities is now a growth name. And if you had told me 10 years ago I would buy utilities for the growth, I would have said you&#39;re crazy. But today you look at the type of growth they can generate because of data center growth, because of AI that is fueling that data center growth. And suddenly you&#39;re really seeing an opportunity there, particularly in the southeast part of the country where you&#39;re seeing continued population demand as well.\n### FEATURED_COMPANY_DEEP_DIVES\nTom, um I&#39;m not calling you crazy, but a lot of people might call you crazy when I look and one of your top picks right now is Intel. This is a great storied American company. They just announced, I believe on Friday, a new CEO, but this is a company that has struggled. Why Intel? And why Intel at $25? Well, Taylor Lip Bhutan is the new CEO. He came from Cadence Designs when the stock was down 86% in 2009. If you had invested $1 million when he became CEO, by the time he stepped down 14 years later in 2023, that $1 million became $68 million. Lip Bhutan is a miracle worker and Intel needs a miracle and I think they&#39;re going to get it. You know, the key thing\n\n### MEDIA_APPEARANCE_RECAP\nI think one of my segments is going to be how the uninvestable became investable while we were building up our Baba position. and everyone said it's uninvestable. It's uninvestable. It's uninvestable. We're going to talk about kind of market sentiment that goes into that, how you can see through the noise, look under the cover, uh follow the fundamentals.

    "MACRO_DATA_SLIDES": "\n\nIt takes years then it happens all at once just like we saw with Alibaba. So this is a very important thing. We know what we own, not getting deterred by short-term noise, whether it&#39;s $5 up or $5 down is completely immaterial. I can assure you uh with Cooper Standard, we are nowhere near that price. \n### MACRO_DATA_SLIDES\nFirst and foremost average S&P returns following 21 corrections of 10% since 1980. So when there has been no recession was which was 14 out of the 21 times which we believe this will be the case this time. Uh 12 months later you&#39;re up 11% on average.\n\n### MACRO_DATA_SLIDES\nI think we&#39;ve actually run out of sellers in the short term, which is why couple weeks ago on Vney, I put myself on a limb. I said we&#39;d be much higher a few weeks out. I think that&#39;s going to be the case. If it&#39;s not already the case, I don&#39;t know if we&#39;re higher yet, but I think we&#39;ll be much higher by the end of the month, uh, as it relates to where we were on that segment. By the way, I&#39;ll be on Vanney tomorrow morning at 10 a.m. Eastern. So, check that out. Very excited. Thank you, Christian Dagger. Um, this is the average path of the S&amp;P you during years 1 and two of the election cycle since 1928. We&#39;ve talked about this every week, which is why we told you in the beginning of February, buckle up, buttercup, and get your shopping list ready. And that&#39;s exactly what happened. Um, here&#39;s the blue line here. So, eight weeks in, that&#39;s beginning of February. And then through the end of March, you get another checkback retest, which probably what we&#39;re going through right now, and then straight up into the summer, and then some weakness in the end of the year. So, I think that the people um you know, we talked about last week, by the way, uh we&#39;re going to be opening up for the small accounts on uh April 1st and uh that you could get in the queue and start to get your paperwork going and get your uh account approved by Interactive Brokers so that on April 1st when we&#39;re open, you can fund and we can start to allocate. Not that you kind of missed this whole thing here uh uh waiting and a lot of you have jumped on that. So excited to get you guys in. Um you can fund before the first but we&#39;ll start to put the money to work for you on April 1st. And for those of you who are thinking about coming in uh we&#39;ll be open for a few weeks and then we&#39;ll close it out for Q2 for the small accounts. uh normal size accounts of the uh by the way our minimum is 1 million and for normalsiz accounts of 5 million uh there are no cuto offs you can come in whenever you want there&#39;s bes bespoke service at that level and then after this massive amount of money can be made in the first year uh then it starts to get you know we&#39;ll be harvesting profits at at full value finding some shorts and uh getting prepared for the year two of the midcycle correction which can be a bit more bumpier here and we love those type of years as well. But, uh, this is where easy money can be made if you&#39;re positioned right. Uh, S&amp;P and NASDAQ 100 again seems to be wanting to put in some bottoms here. Maybe we&#39;ll retest before we go higher, but uh, you know, you can see the equal weight. And by the way, if you&#39;re listening to this on audio, that&#39;s super. Keep listening. But if you can from time to time tune in on YouTube and watch and of course like and comment. That&#39;s what keeps this thing going. The more you like and the more you comment, the more they&#39;re going to serve it up to people when they log into YouTube, which will give us more and more people watching, which will make us want to do this more and more for uh both clients and non-clients alike. We will always do something like this for clients. Uh but for non-clients who have been on the free ride money train uh pay you know do your part and um uh like subscribe comment and uh and let&#39;s keep doing this for a long time. Uh all right Europe rocking and rolling here as we talked about international versus the US that&#39;s been a huge theme coming into the year. Uh even UK Germany started to rally on big stimulus that they announced. Hang Sang has been the, you know, Chinese equity&#39;s biggest performer from uninvestable to investable. All the folks who were downgrading when Baba was 70 are now upgrading at 140. Just the beginning, ladies and gentlemen, as we flip them all over. Japan struggling. I think that&#39;s going to persist because we&#39;ve talked about the carry trade. Uh they have to continue to raise rates after printing money for three decades as inflation kicks in. So that will be uh continued pressure on the reversing the carry trade on the MAG 7 on all the hot money stocks on all the shiny objects that uh people chase that are now getting smashed and these are the people that come up to me and say when will the pain stop? I&#39;m like what pain? We we don&#39;t own any mag 7. We sold all those in July of last year after buying them in in October and November 2022. Um so here&#39;s 10-year yield continues to roll over. I think this is going to go down to the low end of the range. This got up to 480. Complete fake out and I said we were going to see a three handle before we saw a five handle. Everyone was so convinced it was going to five. Not going to be the case. Um so we&#39;ll probably get another fake out here, maybe back up to 450 before we go lower. But um the trend is your friend. Dollar absolutely collapsing after the election. It took off, faked everyone out. We said, &quot;Guys, after the after the inauguration, watch out below.&quot; And here we go. This has a lot further to fall. That&#39;s also good for even the Looney is getting a bounce now. Uh so that&#39;s a good thing. You&#39;ve got some new leadership there. Not sure it&#39;s better than the old leadership, but uh it&#39;s new and at least someone someone that we can talk to and uh get back to a mutually beneficial uh agreement. Uh WTI crude. Look, if all else fails, Wayne Gretzky will run the 51st state and it&#39;ll be absolutely incredible. So, uh, all right, there. There we go. I just lost all my Canadian viewers. Uh, WTI crude oil, it&#39;s in this range. I think this is going to probably resolve higher and some of the oil stocks are going to go with it. Uh, we continue to like our com stock resource, which we bought much lower. Um, uh, WTI crude. So yeah, again, I just not finding anything in oil and gas that makes me super excited, but they&#39;re all going to go up marginally. And when I say marginally, they&#39;re not going to be doubles and triples other than what we have with Commtock. They&#39;re going to be, you know, 30 50% and I just won&#39;t risk capital for for anemic returns like that. Um, copper, this is uh doc Dr. Copper has a PhD in economics. That&#39;s a leading indicator for global growth, which tells you that China&#39;s coming back. uh which we know from Alibaba, our largest position, which has fortunately gone straight up this year, which is exciting. Higher highs, higher lows. Um looks like some of these semis want to bounce. PayPal. God, I love it here. Every new dollar that comes in, we&#39;re we&#39;ve been able to uh pick up some PayPal. We&#39;ll be picking up some more VF Corp. all these incredible companies that we&#39;re excited about. Um, Generrack even has come into a point where it actually add even though we bought well below 100. Uh, I&#39;d love to add more at these levels. Pretty excited about that. Uh, and what else do we have here? I think that&#39;s pretty much it. So, that&#39;s Robert",

    "HEADLINES_AND_NEWS": "\n\n### HEADLINES_AND_NEWS\nRBC . Always puts out some good charts. Alibaba revenues have risen steadily as profits have recovered from its recent dip. So you can see here from 2021 till now even in the most difficult operating environment now that they've got the governmental tailwinds behind them the AI tailwinds and all the other amazing things toll taker with domestic consumption uh as a focus of the government they're just going to mint money and like as I like to say print more bills than the US Treasury. Uh Alibaba's capex is going up. They've they've got 80 billion of cash. That's a good thing for them to do to just box out the other people and gain more and more share. China unveils plan to vigorously boost weak consumption. Vigorously boost. Uh so they're putting their money where their mouth is. Uh that is their game plan. They used to build bridges to nowhere and empty cities. Now they're going to get people to spend because they want to be like America. And Alibaba is the number one toll taker for the middle and upper class spending in China. And that's the spending that matters. Uh like everyone where else in the world, the top 10 or 20% make up the vast majority of the spending and that's where Alibaba thrives. Teimu sells garbage at the low end, which did okay for a couple years when they were in lockdown and everyone felt poor, but as things recover, uh Alibaba is going to whip their butts. China banks cut consumer loan rates to record low to spur demand. Hong Kong stocks hit three-year highs on Trump talks could ease trade trade tensions. So Trump is going to be having a meeting with Xi. Um maybe sooner than June, but it definitely looks like June. Uh Alibaba and other Chinese stocks are crushing US shares. Here's why. This is from a new author at journalist at Baron, not the one that wrote 135 consecutive negative\n\n### HEADLINES_AND_NEWS\nDell CEO explains why he thinks the PC refresh cycle is starting. That&#39;s who who&#39;s the number one beneficiary of the P PC refresh uh uh is Intel um the handsdown leader in inferior chips. uh BFA survey shows biggest ever drop in US stock allocation. So all these managers selling in the hole. Why lowering the yield on the 10-year bonds is more important to Trump than the stock market or interest rates. This is the critical thing. All mortgages are tied to the 10-year Treasury yield. Uh so if he brings that down, number one, he can refinance the US debt at a lower rate. Number two, he can spur house buying, auto buying, everything. Get the game going, get nominal growth cranking so that debt as a percentage of GDP goes down. Uh even if the actual debt in dollars does not uh and uh Bessant was out talking a little bit about that this week, uh about a way that they&#39;re going to lower the 10-year yield by another 30 basis points, and it has to do with the supplementary leverage ratio at banks. If that is removed, uh, it&#39;ll automatically drop 30 basis points to the 10-year yield. Each basis point is worth a billion dollars a year in interest payments. So, uh, that is a good thing, not a bad thing. And they are all over that. So, when I talked about a three handle before a five handle, I wasn&#39;t joking. And now we&#39;ve got an administration that is deadly focused on it. Confidence in German economy surges as parliament approves huge spending plan. Boeing sees cash flow improve as jet factories stabilized. That had a nice move this week. Crown Castle finally completed the sale of the fiber business. The stock shot up. Uh that was great.

Building products. This is huge news this week with uh Brad Jacobs over at QXO. He finally clinched a deal for Beacon Roofing. So he now has his platform company and this is where he will be able to work his magic as he has so many times in the past. Whether it was Waste Connections selling to Waste Management, Multibagger uh in the late 80s or early 90s, whether it was United Rentals when he got involved in 1997, if you'd put up a million dollars with him, it it's now worth $74 million. 74 Bagger. And uh XPO Logistics, if he if you had invested side by side with him, he came in 2011, he invested $150 million of his own money. uh and it was a 160 bagger that if you had uh invested $1 million you'd have 160 million and uh right now QXO he didn't invest 151 150 of his own money he's got so much conviction in this business plan he's put over a billion dollars of his own cash uh which is material and um and we're invested alongside of him so kudos to all of my investors who are now able to uh participate in that and um and the game is just beginning. So, we'll look for any opportunities to add more and take advantage because this is one that you just buy, close your eyes, and in 5 years you have a multibagger.\n\n### FEATURED_COMPANY_DEEP_DIVES\ndollars of his own cash uh which is material and um and we're invested alongside of him so kudos to all of my investors who are now able to uh participate in that and um and the game is just beginning. So, we'll look for any opportunities to add more and take advantage because this is one that you just buy, close your eyes, and in 5 years you have a multibagger. I think this thing's going to be probably the calculations I did when we got involved uh sometime back at around I don't know when let's see when was it I think our base is around $11. I can't find the mouse for the other computer. I think it was 1176 but I'm cuffing that. But um I think the calculation I have internally is like an 8 to10 bagger over a decade. So I think I was looking at like an 80 to $100 stock. So um we'll see as the facts change we could change our mind. Usually with Brad the facts get better as time goes on. So it could be a lot better. So but that's one you just sit there and let him work his magic. No one has created more wealth for shareholders than Brad Jacobs repeatedly over time. Certainly Buffett has created fortunes for people, but that was a one-trick pony. Uh, and a great pony, don't get me wrong, probably the best pony in the world. But, uh, Brad keeps doing it over and over, and I love the timing, and I love the play, and I love the fragmentation, and I see what he sees. And then he has this magic touch where he not only does good economic accretive uh acquisitions, but uh he finds a way to put in innovative technologies to really juice the margins and really get efficiency out of and uh uniformity out of all the acquisitions and that just drops huge amounts of cash to the owners. And uh and that's all he wakes up thinking about every single day. If you've read his books and you've listened to him and you've seen what he's done for shareholders over the years, we're super excited about that and um and glad he finally  got that done. Uh and that's what happens. Winners win and Brad Jacobs is a winner. \n### HEADLINES_AND_NEWS\nSo, uh US natural gas prices up on record flows to LG export plants. Cooler weather forecast.

And these guys were the ones that were most overweight mag 7 and pounding the table at the top with all the shiny objects and um and that's the way it goes. Record rotation out of US stocks.

Uh, China rolled out an action plan for boosting consumption, which might be the Chinese equivalent of quote doing whatever it takes. If you remember during the European debt crisis in 2011, Draghy came out and said we'll do whatever it takes and squeezed all of the shorts and completely destroyed the bond vigilantes.

Um they're they they basically want to get tap into that 20 trillion plus of household savings which is on the side sidelines which would put quite a few dollars in the hands of Alibaba.\n### FEATURED_COMPANY_DEEP_DIVES\nThere is  a statistic out of there where 40% of Chinese consumption goes through Alibaba which is unbelievable. I have to verify that. It's why I took it out of the article, but uh it doesn't surprise me at all. They're the leader in e-commerce and the percentage of commerce that goes through E is at the highest uh in China out of any other developed country. Uh Crown Castle update, they sold that off, which is huge. They're now going to use that cash to buy back. You can see cash flow has been great. Stock has been down. Why? Because they had a low return on investor capital on the fiber business was a drag. losing money and now they got rid of it and they got $8.5 billion to boot. So, expect them to bring in the share account to invest in more uh capex light towers like their 40,000 leg legacy which are cash machines and the stock goes up. So, those of you who listened and locked in the seven or eight% dividend yield now are going to see uh from those levels probably doubles over the next few years on top of collecting 7% a year, which is uh great. Okay. And uh",

So then you can say oh out of these five businesses I really like uh you know whatever it happens to be and then you pull their annual report and that&#39;s one of your 50. Uh that&#39;s the most important thing as far as the noise in the headlines\n\nthe way you&#39;re going to make money if you&#39;re trying to do uh get into the business is to learn companies and uh and be ready to act when their price gets dislocated. And that&#39;s what we do here. So Lee Foster, how do you go about waiting your portfolio? Do you have a scoring system? Struggle with balance allocation. Yeah, that&#39;s kind of special sauce for my clients, but um the higher conviction, the bigger the weight uh is is part of it. But um we also recognize that we have a repeatable framework. What we can control is how we analyze the financials. What we can&#39;t control is the timing in which price confirms the underlying strength of the business or the intrinsic value of the business. So that&#39;s why we&#39;ll have 8 to 12 companies because some are going to get to intrinsic value and beyond much faster than we ever anticipated in less than a year. Uh and some take longer than we anticipated, you know, 3 to 5 year range. Uh and they balance out by doing that. So um so it&#39;s a combination and then there&#39;s like 20 years of experience that goes into it. Like why would I have the instinct when ASOS is fundamentals for instance? um passed through my screen. It was a little bit hairy, but why would I have the instinct to make it such a small position is because I I was very uncomfortable with the CEO and watching him talk. He&#39;s fine. He believes he believes in what he&#39;s doing. I mean, he&#39;s not trying to pull one over, but I I I&#39;ve just met these like uh these consultant types, he he&#39;s probably done his part for what he can do in terms of the easy stuff, but the next phase is probably going to require someone else. Um for us to size into it is is my guess. Um, but that that just comes from experience and seeing the types of CEOs that are full of and seeing the type of CEOs that actually get stuff done. Brad Jacobs is the exact opposite end of the of the spectrum. Little talk, lots of action, huge focuses on what&#39;s ma matters. He creates shareholder value and the rest takes care of itself. Delights his customers uh versus uh try to sound cute at investor day meetings. So um uh that that&#39;s what I would say about that. It&#39;s experience. Uh many thanks for the great work. Also great work on the interview. What do you think about forvia? Aren&#39;t the fundamentals better than Cooper Standard? All right, let&#39;s see. So these are all the people who missed Cooper Standard and didn&#39;t want to get in with us when it was at five bucks. So now they&#39;re trying to find things that are quote unquote better to catch up. So, uh, number one, this is a French company, I guess, which is probably an immediate no for me. Um, FR, unless it&#39;s LVMH, VI A. I can&#39;t find this. Uh gross margin. Let&#39;s just see here. Here we go. Description. sells techn automotive technology solutions, seating, clean mobility, electronics, lighting, vehicle seats, exhaust systems for fuel cell ccentric vehicles. No one gives a about fuel cell ccentric vehicles. Um, display technologies All right, let&#39;s take a look at the financials. It seems like it&#39;s generally okay. All right. Financial analysis return on invested capital. free cash flow. Let&#39;s take a look at the balance sheet. $10 billion of debt, five billion of cash. income statement. Why is there so much dilution here? I I hate this. They&#39;ve almost doubled their share. I mean, not their share counts up 70%. If the financials were good, I I don&#39;t like this. This this is, by the way, this is what angers me about the ASOS CEO. He deluded shareholders by about 20% because he couldn&#39;t think creatively and get the job done. So, I I hate CEOs that do this kind of stuff. So, for me, the fundamentals are great. This is So, uh, not for me. And I emphasized that on the call with Jeff and acknowledged him because if anyone should have diluted the shareholders or or almost had to during the crisis in COVID, it was him and he did not do it. Why? Because he&#39;s a partner. He owns 350,000 shares, 2% of the company. That is material. And that&#39;s why they don&#39;t screw us because they would be screwing themselves. My guess is if you look at management ownership here, uh either part of the delusion is them giving themselves all these shares. Forget it. This is a French scam. Not interested. I don&#39;t care how good the fundamentals look. When you screw the shareholders like this, go to hell. Next.\n### ASK_ME_ANYTHING_QA\nMicah Kelsey, your podcast is incredible. I listen to every uh video cast right when it drops on Thursday nights. Well, thank you very much. Appreciate that. Micah. Uh, the interview with CPS was excellent. Okay, so he&#39;s asking why doesn&#39;t he own more stock? I mean, the guy personally owns 350,000 shares. We own a lot lot lot more than that, but um, you know, he&#39;s one guy. I mean, he&#39;ll he&#39;s going to make I mean, if he does this right, the guy&#39;s going to make personally. I mean, he could make uh 35 to $70 million if he does it right. So, uh I don&#39;t think that&#39;s a small amount for, you know, if you look at his salary. I mean, he&#39;s not running Coca-Cola here. I mean, running a small cap company to be able to go off into the sunset with 70 million bucks is uh is nothing to shake a stick at. So, Rue Reynolds, awesome interview with Jeff Edwards. Thank you for and posting online. Yeah. Well, they they they posted it first and then we posted it after uh based on some of the insights. Oh, based on some of the insights that weren&#39;t in your base case. Look, these were known to us, but we always shave off the whipped cream. The whipped cream is just going to be extra whipped cream for us about the cost per vehicle, China mixhift, hybrids, etc. Um, but if you listen carefully, which is why I&#39;m so interested to see who wins this contest with their takeaways from the interview, because you know there there&#39;s nothing if you if you did your work, there&#39;s nothing new. It&#39;s just he did a really good job of explaining what we&#39;ve been talking about here for three years because we did our work. So, um, and it&#39;s nice to hear it from the CEO versus just some guy who does his work. You know, if you&#39;re going to allocate a lot of money to something, you better know it inside out and upside down. Um, D. So yeah, you know, see what add up the two numbers that I gave on the on the call and then add a little bit more based on some of the things that you think are new information that we&#39;ve known, you know, that we basically were aware of the trends from listening to the quarterly conference calls, but we don&#39;t factor it in because that&#39;s upside like like the sneakers, React X. Okay, that&#39;s probably going to make some good money, but it&#39;s like we have zero attributed to it. So, uh, the AI stuff, the consulting that they&#39;re doing, all that stuff, they&#39;re going to make money on it. It&#39;s, we have it as a zero. We had China as a zero. So, now it&#39;s going to be more than that. That&#39;s great. We had Europe as a zero. It&#39;s going to be more than that. So, uh, fantastic. Uh but even we we if you cover underwrite the downside the upside what what I think is amazing from that interview is just the fact is if the volumes stayed where they are the amount of money that they can make 2 3 years out blew my mind. And god forbid we go up to 1718 with 40% more population. I think we could do 1820 if if if everything clicks all at once. It takes years and then it happens all at once. Ladies and gentlemen, Jared Bentley, first of all, love your podcast. Really appreciate all the hard work you put into it. Your insights are incredible. I recently tried blah blah blah. Okay. Uh, that&#39;s a Okay, cool. Uh, Don L, what&#39;s your thoughts on leases being treated as debt? Don, who cares? It&#39;s like old news. It&#39;s a year and a half old. There&#39;s nothing we can do about it. We focus on things we can control, not things we can&#39;t control. Should it be treated as debt? I can see the argument for that. I personally don&#39;t think it needs to be, but it is. So, on to the next uh JT investor. Tom, amazing job getting Jeff everywhere on the podcast. [Music] Got Yeah, I they&#39;ll be fine. JT, thanks for the advice. Theo Djardin, uh, thanks for all the education you&#39;re providing. I&#39;m sure you made people, uh, I&#39;m sure you made people looking at the business and not just stocks, which are things that go up and down. The Buffett of our age, that&#39;s very kind. I I&#39;m t\n\ntrends from listening to the quarterly conference calls, but we don&#39;t factor it in because that&#39;s upside like like the sneakers, React X.

What do you think about Cloudflare? Um, I think Cloudflare is going to be like black line and I&#39;m going to, you know, like Buffett, it&#39;s like you really have to be, you know, you got to be damn certain that you have a defensible mode. So, look, this thing is up 12x and now it&#39;s pulled back 5 cents and you think it&#39;s a bargain. Um, you know, it&#39;s funny. One of the\n\n### ASK_ME_ANYTHING_QA\nwhen you see the margin of safety is sufficient after recent draw down. What do you think about Cloudflare? Um, I think Cloudflare is going to be like black line and I&#39;m going to, you know, like Buffett, it&#39;s like you really have to be, you know, you got to be damn certain that you have a defensible mode. So, look, this thing is up 12x and now it&#39;s pulled back 5 cents and you think it&#39;s a bargain. Um, you know, it&#39;s funny. One of the questions\n\n### ASK_ME_ANYTHING_QA\n\nI would have preferred to buy my first share a lot lower. Uh, the good news is the work that I did was so comprehensive that I was able to buy down every time that it took longer than we wanted for it to go and bring our basis across all accounts to $83. So, if it hadn&#39;t taken so long, I wouldn&#39;t have half the position or even a quarter of the position that we have today. So, it&#39;s been the best thing that ever happened to us. Now, that said, what would I do differently is um and you probably noticed it in the last year is broken momentum stocks I stay away from. So, um they really have to put in a base for a while. Like you know if you look at uh PayPal for instance you know this was another broken momentum stock and you know we were kind of waiting down here until it had bottomed for a year year and a half before we got aggressive about it uh in the low 60s and and high 50s. So, uh, I would say that we&#39;re quicker to recognize when a growth stock is broken and wait to be looking after a couple of years in here versus at the first selloff uh, in here and then having to average down before you get the recovery back. So, um, and this is a kind of a perfect example of with Cloudflare is, um, you know, and a lot of people send us stocks that are up like 20x and they just pulled back, you know, 30 or 40% and they&#39;re like, they want to jump in because they&#39;re stuck in recency bias of uh, the success. But these things, you know, when they crack, they they tend to take a because they hurt. so many institutional shareholders, it takes an awful long time to rebuild that institutional base, which is why a lot of these uh take a couple of years to build bases and you know, get a new CEO, get a new plan, and then after they&#39;ve done that, then you get the first move, then you get the pullback, and then it starts to go. Same thing with Baba. And Baba had a couple fake outs because of government stuff that you can&#39;t control. So, this was a fake out here. Um, and then it took another year. We bought a ton ton more stock and then you got the move here, fake out, and now now it just wants to go. And we saw something similar in 2017. You can look back, you got that fake out, and then once it goes, it&#39;s straight up. Daytoday you&#39;ll see up $5, down $10, but it&#39;s lower highs, uh, higher higher highs and higher lows all the way up to the promised land. And I think this time will be no different. So I would say the only thing I would do different but that&#39;s why we&#39;ve always had the 8 to 10 I mean is because our work was was really good uh and we knew what we owned which is what gave us the confidence as it was going against us and everyone was crying uninvestable and ADR and all that that&#39;s completely useless noise um we kept adding so on the one hand we&#39;re more careful about buying broken growth stocks that haven&#39;t been broken for more than a year or two. Uh on the other hand, nothing&#39;s nothing&#39;s changed in our framework. That&#39;s just kind of technical noise. Uh that&#39;ll just give us a hair better timing, but we&#39;ll wind up with smaller positions because we have less time to know the company and less time to accumulate. So, I kind of like how it worked out. Uh but that would be the one key key uh learning lesson. \n### ASK_ME_ANYTHING_QA\nWhat are your thoughts on Coal Company BTU? Um, we&#39;ve gone through this one. I think the financials look fine. Uh, but it&#39;s not something we really want to be involved in. We&#39;ll just stick with natural gas for now. Interestingly enough, what did this thing do under Trump 1.0? Well, that was co Well, it started crashing before CO actually. So, uh, all right. I&#39;ll take a quick look. You&#39;re you&#39;re probably going to get a bounce here, so I don&#39;t want to tell you to to pass on it, but cash flow and revenues are all turning negative. So, I&#39;m not sure that that gives me a lot of confidence. The stock price reflects it. Question is, let&#39;s take a look at quarterly. See if they&#39;re actually turning at all. I I I don&#39;t want to be involved in this. Um, all right, River. River, we&#39;re we&#39;re playing that through com stock and we have a lot of reasons and a lot of outs with that. This one, it&#39;s just too binary. I had a friend who bought a ton of metal private deals in 2011. Thought he was a genius. Lost every penny. Uh, River Ray, what do you think of super lowro shoe vans? Good step in my opinion towards marketing toward women. I I leave those hard decisions to bracken. I just hire the jockey. He takes care of that stuff. I think they look super cool. Uh I think he&#39;s going to figure it out. All he&#39;s got to do, he told you what he wants to do. If you listen to all the calls, he wanted to detock. And then once he detocked, then he was going to get the machine going with advertising, influencers, etc. So once you see these things on uh Sabrina Carpenter or whatever, every single 12-year-old girl will buy them and it will be off to the races and people will say, &quot;Wow, how how did the stock go to 40 bucks? It&#39;s too expensive now.&quot; And then at 60, they&#39;ll buy it. and uh and then at 100 it&#39;ll be disbelief, but this is not a guy you want to bet against. Daniel Borman, thanks for the awesome podcast. Tom, what are your thoughts on Generrack rebound? I mean, look, we bought it below 100. It&#39;s it&#39;s up huge for us. So, uh would we put new money to work here? 100%. As new client money comes in, probably Generrack will be on the list at these levels for sure. Uh easy peasy. Jack Corners Cornes, thanks for all you do for us. Uh, ASOS. Okay, we covered that for you this week. Nothing yet for us. Patrick Kelly hard. Thanks for all your hard work. I found you by accident when I told a friend that I was going to start a position in Alibaba in early 2023. Told me to check out your weekly podcast because you were also long baba. Uh, thanks for helping me stay the course through the long sideways grind. You&#39;re welcome. It wasn&#39;t an easy time and it was a very lonely voice, but [Music] uh oh, he says, &quot;I&#39;m curious if there are any money managers in the business that if you found out we&#39;re on the opposite side of one of their trades would make you go back and check your work.&quot; Uh, answer is no. As a matter of fact, I&#39;ve had some of my most successful positions have had multi-billionaires on the other side of the trade. I mean, being long the market in 2022, I had Ray Dallio on the other side of the trade. I mean, who who who could scare you more than Ray Dio, one of the best hedge fund managers of all time. It&#39;s been bearish the whole way up since 2022. So, um, no, I do my own work. I I don&#39;t read a lot of secondhand material. I always go to s source material. Um, and uh, you know, just as God didn&#39;t give me the FOMO gene, he doesn&#39;t give me the distraction gene. I do my own work. I draw my own conclusions. I, you know, I have my filters. Would I put 100% of my net worth into into this to buy the whole business if JP Morgan was going to finance the debt? And the answer has to be yes. And to come to a yes answer is not casual. It&#39;s not some technical stupid breakout pattern like all these schmucks talk about on TV. It&#39;s about knowing what you own and what are the current prospects of cash generation and the future prospects of cash generation and the leadership and all that goes into it and the channel checks and the competition analysis and it and just instinct, you know, and seeing what works and not, you know, um and instinct on people is a is a big thing as it relates to uh the jockeyies that are running your business for you. Axel B could uh cover that. Zack Hong. Okay. He&#39;s asking which college to go to. Okay. Rick Richard. Okay. So, uh Rick, by the way, Rick&#39;s a super smart guy. Um, longtime listener, congratulations on winning number one podcast recently in the hedge fund category by the way. Uh, welld deserved. Can you explain a little more about your framework for E for setting exit valuations? Is a lot of comps based on enterprise or no has nothing to do with comps or any of that? Uh, how how often do you find yourself allowing to reset the price higher based on new information or vice versa, lower exit price? Um, if I&#39;m taking my exit price down lower, I might be thinking about getting about getting out of a position completely. Uh, that rarely happens. Um, and it I can&#39;t think of any time it&#39;s ever happened with a full-size position. So, uh, I&#39;ll leave that. As far as taking it up, I think with Bracken, it&#39;s it&#39;s definitely changed. I thought it was going to be a quick double to 45. Well, that would have been a triple to 45 and we&#39;d be out. looking at what he&#39;s doing and how he&#39;s thinking about it and his background, uh, I do think this he&#39;s going to take this thing to new highs and beyond. Um, but I have to see quarterto quarter, you know, what he says and what he does. So far, he&#39;s doing exactly what he says, just like Shane O Kelly with Advanced Auto Parts, by the way. But, um, if if if I get a couple quarters where they&#39;re changing what they say or taking their expectation down, then I have to adjust. I haven&#39;t seen that yet. Um, will I take it up? I think that&#39;s that&#39;s exactly what Bracken talks, but it usually has to do with cash flow. It usually and and then there&#39;s just a million factors that go into when I know it&#39;s reached the crescendo and and a lot of you have been with me for these exits and and I usually get pretty damn close to the top, which is just, you know, maybe some of it&#39;s luck, but most of it is just experience. Um and and often times we don&#39;t it&#39;s not binary. We&#39;ll usually keep a trailer on because just as these companies overshoot to the downside, they tend to overshoot to the upside. Overshoot to the downside with dispondency, overshoot to the upside with euphoria. Um so we&#39;re getting in in tranches and getting out in tranches uh around that intrinsic value. Um, but a lot of the secret sauce comes down to cash generation. How it, you know, in the businesses that are cyclical, that&#39;s pretty easy for us to know where we want to be out. Um, and in the but but as far as like oh it&#39;s peers are trading at this and that I&#39;d be more interested in looking at its historic multiple channel than its comp multiple channel because there are unique attributes to each business that we own and u and and proprietary modes based on the technology andor the products that they have andor the brand equity that they have. Uh so it&#39;s not a it&#39;s not a simple answer, but we do know when things are pushed to the top of ranges and we do know kind of what the max out earnings power is going to be for the type of businesses we&#39;re buying. If you&#39;re buying the guess the future businesses, there&#39;s no there&#39;s no way to tell. There&#39;s absolutely which is why we don&#39;t do those. If you notice, all the businesses we buy have been around for 5 10 20 30 years. So we can see how they operate through different cycles and how they&#39;re proven to operate through cycles and where they tend to peak out in the next cycle. And and that&#39;s a little easier than saying, you know, this thing&#39;s the next future of whatever curing cancer or, you know, Bitcoin or all these things that you&#39;re just guessing. And then you got these people looking at charts thinking they have some edge. It&#39;s it&#39;s comical. So, uh, I buy businesses that I can understand how they operate, how they recover and where they come out in terms of relationship to intrinsic value and in excess of it. And that&#39;s kind of how we think about where we&#39;re getting out in the future. And we adjust based on if management does a lot better job. And we might miss upside on that, but um, that&#39;s okay. We know what we have to get out of each investment. Uh, what is this? Jason Patel. Oh, okay. He&#39;s talking about the China thing in CPS. Um, Gleb Sitikov, thanks for your podcast. It&#39;s probably the most efficient two hours spent per week. Tremendous value packed in each episode. Five below. I think a lot of these tariff hit retail retailers um are going to make a comeback whether it&#39;s Dollar General, Dollar Tree. Let&#39;s take a look at Five Below. Probably five below, maybe even Target. I think you&#39;re probably okay there. Let&#39;s just see here though. I want to see. Yeah. So, this is a broken momentum stock. This might I mean this could certainly bounce back straight back up for sure. Um, but it also wouldn&#39;t surprise me when it&#39;s broken like this if it takes a few years to build a base. So, that&#39;s kind of the nuance. So, I mean, looking at the financials here, my guess is we&#39;re going to come to the conclusion that it does make sense to buy it. But in terms of the reality of all the broken investors in this thing, uh this was a 10 bagger that is now broken. Uh you know, the one takeaway would be, okay, let&#39;s talk about it in a year and if it&#39;s between, you know, 40 and 80, let&#39;s start to build a position. And you&#39;re like, why would you do that if the revenues continue to go up and the earnings continue to go up? Because so many people chased up here at Euphoria, they&#39;re just broken and they&#39;re stuck with recency bias that it&#39;s broken forever. Like you&#39;re seeing like you saw in Baba as it built the base, like you saw in PayPal as it built the base. These people are broken mofos. They lost a lot of money because they chased up here after the 26 bagger and they bought this thinking it was cheap uh when it was a broken momentum stock. So, uh, with this one, I would, uh, I, you know, let&#39;s just take a look at the cash flow. Yeah, I mean, everything kind of looks okay. You know, 1.7 billion in debt, 500 cash. probably gonna be generally okay, but I wouldn&#39;t be in a rush. I&#39;d probably pass like if I missed the move from 60 back to 200. So, I missed it. But like if this thing languishes for a couple of years uh and builds a base and you know all the hurt people get out of the stock at the lows uh then it becomes more interesting. So that would be a lesson that I took away to answer Shavein&#39;s uh uh question which was a good one. Uh Jimmy Jones, Unilver, we&#39;ve covered that. Let&#39;s just kind of snore. Unilver. Yeah. No, not for me. Um next. Why are you sending me two this week? Uh Jeffy, wait. If you&#39;re inclined to build an income or covered calls, look, no. Why? Why are you screwing around with this kind of nonsense? I look, if you like a company, just buy the damn company. Why would you want it called away from you? all this about, oh, the the stock went down. And then you hear them say, but I wrote cover calls on it, so I got a dollar and the stock&#39;s down $40. It&#39;s like, wow, you&#39;re brilliant. Like, simplify. That&#39;s all I&#39;m going to tell you guys. Just simplify your lives. Um, and and you don&#39;t have to screw around with that stuff because it works for a while and it doesn&#39;t. If you want to get into the options game, learn how to sell them, not how to buy them. Now, what we do for clients with the overlays and elongated. If you&#39;re going to be a buyer, you want to be over the long term. If you&#39;re going to be a seller, you want to be in the next 30 days where you get the time decay. But that&#39;s that&#39;s like a 4hour conversation, which I&#39;m not going to have. Uh Jason Zen uh Jason goes into trade desk based on last week and he has experience with it and he&#39;s he&#39;s a pass trying to give me some insight on the technology. I appreciate that cuz I asked for it. John Lou by sheer chance came across your weekly podcast confidently say it helped me find my footing in investing going forward. I appreciate all the work you&#39;ve done. Uh, okay. So, the CPS question was answered. Carolyn H, first, thank you for helping us all understand what makes Mr. Market tick. You&#39;re welcome. By the way, thank you for all these kind comments, guys, because a lot of work does go into this. And um, all right. Grateful to be out of the mainstream view of stocks and into the method of understanding value in business I own part of. There&#39;s been a lot of talk about recession lady lately, which got me thinking. Obviously, recession shouldn&#39;t change the framework for picking high quality business at a dislocated price, but does it change the strategy for inquiring them? Perhaps they might take longer for price to reach intrinsic value. Anything else to be thinking about? I think you answered your own question. If you get a recession, it just takes longer. Um, but if you start getting in the predict a recession game, uh, good luck because you&#39;ll be in the DIO camp for the last three years and miss 100% ups. VSCO [Music] stock. Uh, Victorious Secret. They destroyed this brand. I mean, the bottom line is there&#39;s no way I&#39;m going to say this that is going to sound nice. So, I&#39;m probably not going to say everything that&#39;s on my mind. But the bottom line is lingerie is supposed to be sexy. Okay? When you try to make it something other than that, then you&#39;re not selling lingerie and you lose the cache for the whole brand. When Victoria&#39;s Secret hummed, they had the supermodels. Now they don&#39;t have superm models because they don&#39;t want to pay them all that money, so they just put women up. And long story short, I think this is completely destroyed. My guess is they&#39;re trying to reverse that. Um, VCO Yeah, there&#39;s no thing is there there&#39;s some stability here, but there&#39;s no inflection yet. And that&#39;s so all I can tell you is I would want to understand is there a new CEO? What&#39;s their plan? What is their track record of success? And on those bases, you know, if they if they get back to their roots, kind of like what Vans is trying to do right now. [Music] Um, and that&#39;s what Bracken did. He spent time getting to know the family and learning the business from the 60s forward. he knows the business like the back of his hand and the culture and everything else then I think there&#39;s a chance but you know that&#39;s that&#39;s hours and hours of conference calls learning the whole thing and um it looks like they might have troughed here so I think it warrants further investigation I do and have heard in art right reading articles etc that they are moving back to toward what made them successful so if you can get some confidence around that um it&#39;s probably worth a look. Um, yeah, share count has come down. So, some things are going in the right direction. Sounds like they&#39;ve got someone new running it and doing it properly. So, Medi, thank you for bringing it to us. I think it warrants further exploration. All right, I think we got a couple more here. Oh, Valeris offshore driller. Okay, so Vle wants to know about Rick Hospitality, which is a rollup of nudie bars. Okay, the guy who did this, I got pitched on this when I was in Puerto Rico, and the pitch is fantastic. The guy who actually runs it understands return on invested capital, understands how to do a rollup, understands how to do a business. What he doesn&#39;t understand is the fact that no institutional money manager that wants to keep his job is going to have a big position in strip clubs and that&#39;s why they&#39;re never going to get the sponsorship that they know. So, I would bet on the guy if he went into another rollup. fact that he&#39;s in this roll up, it&#39;s going to be very very very hard to get the type of sponsorship you need to have a monster winner. So on that basis, I&#39;m a pass. Um uh let&#39;s take a look at Aaris. These are all the guys wanting to get offshore drillers. Um the problem with this one is it hasn&#39;t been around long enough for me to be comfortable with it, but I&#39;ll take a quick look at the financials because I do think these services are going to move. I would pick something easier like you know maybe Hallebertton or maybe no National Oil Well Varco but that one&#39;s a stretch or maybe um Slumber I mean that&#39;s one&#39;s kind of a no-brainer but the key is there&#39;s not enough margin of safety. So this is still negative free cash flow revenues are going up. It&#39;s too new for me. So I&#39;m I&#39;m a pass on this. Um and I&#39;ll leave it at that. Okay, that&#39;s client inquiry. And that&#39;s it. So, we&#39;ll be back next week, same time, same place. In the meantime, make it a great one. Thank you for tuning in. Bye for [Music] now. Heat. [Music] Heat. Heat. Heat.

They did. that largely gives them runway uh well to 2027 and beyond. And we&#39;re going to talk a little bit about that. We think well beyond. Uh and uh the idea for getting involved in Cooper Standard was actually uh a person that I look up to tremendously who recently passed is Charlie Mer. And Charlie Munger did a very similar investment in the 2001 recession, a cyclical trough in the industry. Uh, and this is a pretty regular occurrence as Jeff will tell you in the auto business.

And here&#39;s the thing, Nvidia is not down because of lack of demand. Nvidia is down because of lack of supply. TSMC is at capacity and only gives them $4 billion of revenue growth per quarter, which on a bigger base decelerates the revenue growth from 250% down to probably 30 40% by the end of this year. They need capacity. TSMC could say, &quot;Yes, Mr. Trump, we&#39;re going to invest a trillion dollars in the United States.&quot; The problem is it&#39;s going to take them four to five years to get to where Intel is with their fabs today. So, love Gellzinger or hate him, he did one thing over the last four years. He set Intel up for success. And Lip Bhan is going to come in and spike the football in the end zone as uh these this chip production comes on on board.

But Tom, I do like the bull call. \n\nYeah, I look, we continue to like China and people said we were crazy when we were buying Alibaba in the 90s, in the 80s, in the 60s. Now it&#39;s over 145, going to over 200 over the next 12 to 24 months. I&#39;m telling you, Intel is going to be the exact same way, Taylor.

I want to thank Mike Larson for having me on. As always, my buddy Kenny Pulcari and Jim Bianco, who is a bond expert uh and macroeconomic expert was great to be on with the three of them.",
      "when Nvidia was trading at $152, uh everyone said, \"What are you doing for AI?\" I said, \"I'm doing this company called Commtock Resources. They they're a natural gas play and it was $8 and change. Now it's up close to $20.\" And then people were like, \"No, really? What are you doing about AI?\" I was like, \"Well, I'm doing this thing called Alibaba. It was under well under a hundred bucks. Now it's 145 going to 200. It may be that Cooper Standard is going to be the AI play of 2025 with everything going on. But leaving that aside, here's the first question from Grock. Uh suggested that I ask you. Again, all of this is opinion, not advice. This is not recommendations. Talk to your financial advisor. This is not guidance. This is a conversation. Uh so here's what Grock says. Jeff, if you were an investor or or if if you were an investor with $1 million to deploy, why would you put it all into Cooper Standard stock right now? Now, we would never recommend anyone puts 100% of anything into one stock, but uh but that's the question. So, give us uh some guidelines here, Jeff. Yeah, as I mentioned in the conversation, Tom, I mean, because we've taken care of our own business, right? We've over the last 5 years, we've established a cost base that allows the company to flourish. Uh we've already put enough points on the scoreboard to tell you that by the end of 2025, we're going to be at double digit EBDA and we're going to be at double digit return on invested capital. And then when we forecast and just look out a few years from that point, uh we've said that our net leverage is going to be uh two times or less. All of those statements are on the volumes that exist today and a very slight increase in forecast over the course of the next three years. Uh so if I would look at that and and I would be an investor, I would say, \"Wow, there's a company that's delivering results. There's a company that that has uh told us that the that they're going to return to the type of prosperity that they exist that existed back in the 2017 period of time that you mentioned earlier was $140 stock price. I'm not predicting that. I'm just telling you that I I know what that feels like and I know what it feels like today and I know what the industry pent up demand is for the next three or four years. So with that, uh, it's pretty tough to find, I think, a company in an industry that's better positioned than than what we are. Love it. And, uh, this one is is also from Grock, and it's interesting that they mentioned Warren Buffett because, uh, I look up to him a lot. A lot of our framework is similar. Uh, if you had to pitch Cooper Standard to Warren Buffett, what's the number one metric you'd want to prove this is a cash machine worth owning? I think we talked about this. Uh I own over 350,000 shares of Cooper Standard stock. Uh that's about 2% of the company. Uh so that's I think putting my uh money where my mouth is. And it also uh for me is probably the most important metric. And I I can I could talk to you about all the other company metrics, but I'll just stick to that personal one. I love it. I love it. And final question, Jeff, is there anything else we didn't cover that you'd like to share with our audience of investors today? I think we've covered it all. I just I'm I'm excited about the future. I'm excited about Cooper Standard. I mean, we have great employees. We've talked a lot about our product. We haven't talked much about our culture today. But it isn't just the what we make, it's how we do it. And and I'm so proud of the uh of the 21,000 employees that call this home. And we don't have a lot of turnover. Uh we have great people. It's not the sign on the building that makes us Tom. It's the people within the buildings. And and I'm really proud of that fact. So that's how I would end it. Thank you very much for the conversation. Well, well, thank you so much for joining us. Very grateful for you taking the time. That's chairman and CEO of Cooper Standard, Jeff Edwards.",
      "All of this is benefiting Cooper Standard. Intel is the best chip stock this year in a surprising reversal. No one is expecting overnight, but investors like Intel&#39;s CEO announcement. Um, you know, the last shall be first. I I went on Charles Payne last year when Nvidia was $153 and I said to sell Nvidia and buy Intel and after that he didn&#39;t invite me on the show for three months. Uh may maybe I&#39;ll get back on the show now because it&#39;s proved to be the correct call. Although they did call me this morning.",
      "Nvidia&#39;s growth rate has decelerated, not for lack of demand, but for lack of supply. TSMC is at capacity. Intel in the background has been building up the fabs. They&#39;re ready for prime time. Nvidia&#39;s testing chips. Broadcom is testing chips. And Lip Bhutan is going to spike the football in the end zone. We&#39;re very excited about Intel. And it&#39;s trading just a couple bucks over tangible book value. So, if they liquidated the whole company today, you get most of your money back. And if he does what he could do, which we know he can, it could be a double and beyond in the next 12 to 24 months. But Tom, a lot of people are thinking that Intel I mean I&#39;ve heard um you know not rumors but you know words used like they&#39;re selling the car for parts, right? Where you had rumors about Broadcom, TSMC coming and looking at different portions of the business. Do you like it as a sum of the whole or do you like it as different parts? Look, if they sell it off for parts, we probably get 3540 bucks when all is said and done. Lit Bhutan has stated he&#39;s going to run this business. He&#39;s not interested in a fire sale. He&#39;s going to turn this into a multibagger. Everything is there. Actually, Gellzinger did lay the found foundry uh uh framework to move ahead and to supply the Nvidia and the Broadcoms of the world. Lip Bhan is going to finish that execution at the five yard line, take it in for a touchdown. This is going to be, look, it was on no one&#39;s bingo card at the beginning of this year that Nvidia would be among the worst chip producers this year in terms of performers. And Intel is now the top performing semiconductor company for year-to- date 2025. Okay. I think people might say that says more about Nvidia than it does about Intel. We&#39;ll see.

    "BABA": [
      "RBC . Always puts out some good charts. Alibaba revenues have risen steadily as profits have recovered from its recent dip. So you can see here from 2021 till now even in the most difficult operating environment now that they've got the governmental tailwinds behind them the AI tailwinds and all the other amazing things toll taker with domestic consumption uh as a focus of the government they're just going to mint money and like as I like to say print more bills than the US Treasury. Uh Alibaba's capex is going up. They've they've got 80 billion of cash. That's a good thing for them to do to just box out the other people and gain more and more share. China unveils plan to vigorously boost weak consumption. Vigorously boost. Uh so they're putting their money where their mouth is. Uh that is their game plan. They used to build bridges to nowhere and empty cities. Now they're going to get people to spend because they want to be like America. And Alibaba is the number one toll taker for the middle and upper class spending in China. And that's the spending that matters. Uh like everyone where else in the world, the top 10 or 20% make up the vast majority of the spending and that's where Alibaba thrives. Teimu sells garbage at the low end, which did okay for a couple years when they were in lockdown and everyone felt poor, but as things recover, uh Alibaba is going to whip their butts. China banks cut consumer loan rates to record low to spur demand. Hong Kong stocks hit three-year highs on Trump talks could ease trade trade tensions. So Trump is going to be having a meeting with Xi. Um maybe sooner than June, but it definitely looks like June. Uh Alibaba and other Chinese stocks are crushing US shares. Here's why. This is from a new author at journalist at Baron, not the one that wrote 135 consecutive negative",
      "negative headlines  about China and Chinese stocks. have not seen her write in months now since Alibaba has been going straight up and she told everyone to get out of it. Uh but uh all the rest of the authors have been absolutely phenomenon uh Kellum included. Why is China spending billions to get people to open their wallets is a great article from the BBC getting serious about spending. Uh and Baba is the key toll taker with Tao and T-Mol.",
      "Same thing with Baba. And Baba had a couple fake outs because of government stuff that you can&#39;t control. So, this was a fake out here. Um, and then it took another year. We bought a ton ton more stock and then you got the move here, fake out, and now now it just wants to go. And we saw something similar in 2017. You can look back, you got that fake out, and then once it goes, it&#39;s straight up. Daytoday you&#39;ll see up $5, down $10, but it&#39;s lower highs, uh, higher higher highs and higher lows all the way up to the promised land. And I think this time will be no different. So I would say the only thing I would do different but that&#39;s why we&#39;ve always had the 8 to 10 I mean is because our work was was really good uh and we knew what we owned which is what gave us the confidence as it was going against us and everyone was crying uninvestable and ADR and all that that&#39;s completely useless noise um we kept adding so on the one hand we&#39;re more careful about buying broken growth stocks that haven&#39;t been broken for more than a year or two",

      "here is a statistic out of there where 40% of Chinese consumption goes through Alibaba which is unbelievable. I have to verify that. It's why I took it out of the article, but uh it doesn't surprise me at all. They're the leader in e-commerce and the percentage of commerce that goes through E is at the highest uh in China out of any other developed country. Uh Crown Castle update, they sold that off, which is huge. They're now going to use that cash to buy back. You can see cash flow has been great. Stock has been down. Why? Because they had a low return on investor capital on the fiber business was a drag. losing money and now they got rid of it and they got $8.5 billion to boot. So, expect them to bring in the share account to invest in more uh capex light towers like their 40,000 leg legacy which are cash machines and the stock goes up. So, those of you who listened and locked in the seven or eight% dividend yield now are going to see uh from those levels probably doubles over the next few years on top of collecting 7% a year, which is uh great. Okay. And uh",

You know, 1.7 billion in debt, 500 cash. probably gonna be generally okay, but I wouldn&#39;t be in a rush. I&#39;d probably pass like if I missed the move from 60 back to 200. So, I missed it. But like if this thing languishes for a couple of years uh and builds a base and you know all the hurt people get out of the stock at the lows uh then it becomes more interesting. So that would be a lesson that I took away to answer Shavein&#39;s uh uh question which was a good one",
      "Hang Sang has been the, you know, Chinese equity&#39;s biggest performer from uninvestable to investable. All the folks who were downgrading when Baba was 70 are now upgrading at 140. Just the beginning, ladies and gentlemen, as we flip them all over. Japan struggling. I think that&#39;s going to persist because we&#39;ve talked about the carry trade. Uh they have to continue to raise rates after printing money for three decades as inflation kicks in. So that will be uh continued pressure on the reversing the carry trade on the MAG 7 on all the hot money stocks on all the shiny objects that uh people chase that are now getting smashed and these are the people that come up to me and say when will the pain stop? I&#39;m like what pain? We we don&#39;t own any mag 7. We sold all those in July of last year after buying them in in October and November 2022. Um so here&#39;s 10-year yield continues to roll over. I think this is going to go down to the low end of the range. This got up to 480. Complete fake out and I said we were going to see a three handle before we saw a five handle. Everyone was so convinced it was going to five. Not going to be the case. Um so we&#39;ll probably get another fake out here, maybe back up to 450 before we go lower. But um the trend is your friend. Dollar absolutely collapsing after the election. It took off, faked everyone out. We said, &quot;Guys, after the after the inauguration, watch out below.&quot; And here we go. This has a lot further to fall. That&#39;s also good for even the Looney is getting a bounce now. Uh so that&#39;s a good thing. You&#39;ve got some new leadership there. Not sure it&#39;s better than the old leadership, but uh it&#39;s new and at least someone someone that we can talk to and uh get back to a mutually beneficial uh agreement. Uh WTI crude. Look, if all else fails, Wayne Gretzky will run the 51st state and it&#39;ll be absolutely incredible. So, uh, all right, there. There we go. I just lost all my Canadian viewers. Uh, WTI crude oil, it&#39;s in this range. I think this is going to probably resolve higher and some of the oil stocks are going to go with it. Uh, we continue to like our com stock resource, which we bought much lower. Um, uh, WTI crude. So yeah, again, I just not finding anything in oil and gas that makes me super excited, but they&#39;re all going to go up marginally. And when I say marginally, they&#39;re not going to be doubles and triples other than what we have with Commtock. They&#39;re going to be, you know, 30 50% and I just won&#39;t risk capital for for anemic returns like that. Um, copper, this is uh doc Dr. Copper has a PhD in economics. That&#39;s a leading indicator for global growth, which tells you that China&#39;s coming back. uh which we know from Alibaba, our largest position, which has fortunately gone straight up this year, which is exciting. Higher highs, higher lows. Um looks like some of these semis want to bounce. PayPal. God, I love it here. Every new dollar that comes in, we&#39;re we&#39;ve been able to uh pick up some PayPal. We&#39;ll be picking up some more VF Corp. all these incredible companies that we&#39;re excited about. Um, Generrack even has come into a point where it actually add even though we bought well below 100. Uh, I&#39;d love to add more at these levels. Pretty excited about that. Uh, and what else do we have here? I think that&#39;s pretty much it. So, that&#39;s Robert",
      "when Nvidia was trading at $152, uh everyone said, \"What are you doing for AI?\" I said, \"I'm doing this company called Commtock Resources. They they're a natural gas play and it was $8 and change. Now it's up close to $20.\" And then people were like, \"No, really? What are you doing about AI?\" I was like, \"Well, I'm doing this thing called Alibaba. It was under well under a hundred bucks. Now it's 145 going to 200. It may be that Cooper Standard is going to be the AI play of 2025 with everything going on. But leaving that aside, here's the first question from Grock. Uh suggested that I ask you. Again, all of this is opinion, not advice. This is not recommendations. Talk to your financial advisor. This is not guidance. This is a conversation. Uh so here's what Grock says. Jeff, if you were an investor or or if if you were an investor with $1 million to deploy, why would you put it all into Cooper Standard stock right now? Now, we would never recommend anyone puts 100% of anything into one stock, but uh but that's the question. So, give us uh some guidelines here, Jeff. Yeah, as I mentioned in the conversation, Tom, I mean, because we've taken care of our own business, right? We've over the last 5 years, we've established a cost base that allows the company to flourish. Uh we've already put enough points on the scoreboard to tell you that by the end of 2025, we're going to be at double digit EBDA and we're going to be at double digit return on invested capital. And then when we forecast and just look out a few years from that point, uh we've said that our net leverage is going to be uh two times or less. All of those statements are on the volumes that exist today and a very slight increase in forecast over the course of the next three years. Uh so if I would look at that and and I would be an investor, I would say, \"Wow, there's a company that's delivering results. There's a company that that has uh told us that the that they're going to return to the type of prosperity that they exist that existed back in the 2017 period of time that you mentioned earlier was $140 stock price. I'm not predicting that. I'm just telling you that I I know what that feels like and I know what it feels like today and I know what the industry pent up demand is for the next three or four years. So with that, uh, it's pretty tough to find, I think, a company in an industry that's better positioned than than what we are. Love it. And, uh, this one is is also from Grock, and it's interesting that they mentioned Warren Buffett because, uh, I look up to him a lot. A lot of our framework is similar. Uh, if you had to pitch Cooper Standard to Warren Buffett, what's the number one metric you'd want to prove this is a cash machine worth owning? I think we talked about this. Uh I own over 350,000 shares of Cooper Standard stock. Uh that's about 2% of the company. Uh so that's I think putting my uh money where my mouth is. And it also uh for me is probably the most important metric. And I I can I could talk to you about all the other company metrics, but I'll just stick to that personal one. I love it. I love it. And final question, Jeff, is there anything else we didn't cover that you'd like to share with our audience of investors today? I think we've covered it all. I just I'm I'm excited about the future. I'm excited about Cooper Standard. I mean, we have great employees. We've talked a lot about our product. We haven't talked much about our culture today. But it isn't just the what we make, it's how we do it. And and I'm so proud of the uh of the 21,000 employees that call this home. And we don't have a lot of turnover. Uh we have great people. It's not the sign on the building that makes us Tom. It's the people within the buildings. And and I'm really proud of that fact. So that's how I would end it. Thank you very much for the conversation. Well, well, thank you so much for joining us. Very grateful for you taking the time. That's chairman and CEO of Cooper Standard, Jeff Edwards.",

As a matter of fact, I&#39;ve had some of my most successful positions have had multi-billionaires on the other side of the trade. I mean, being long the market in 2022, I had Ray Dallio on the other side of the trade. I mean, who who who could scare you more than Ray Dio, one of the best hedge fund managers of all time.

Look, I I think uh Intel is the most underrated story. If they liquidated the whole damn thing today, you&#39;d probably get about 22 23 bucks. It&#39;s trading at 25. Lip Banan uh was at Cadence Designs, which makes the software for all of these chip designers. Lip Bhutan became CEO of Cadence Designs in January 2009 after the stock was down 86%.

They need capacity. TSMC could say, &quot;Yes, Mr. Trump, we&#39;re going to invest a trillion dollars in the United States.&quot; The problem is it&#39;s going to take them four to five years to get to where Intel is with their fabs today. So, love Gellzinger or hate him, he did one thing over the last four years. He set Intel up for success. And Lip Bhan is going to come in and spike the football in the end zone as uh these this chip production comes on on board.

All mortgages are tied to the 10-year Treasury yield. Uh so if he brings that down, number one, he can refinance the US debt at a lower rate. Number two, he can spur house buying, auto buying, everything. Get the game going, get nominal growth cranking so that debt as a percentage of GDP goes down. Uh even if the actual debt in dollars does not uh and uh Bessant was out talking a little bit about that this week, uh about a way that they&#39;re going to lower the 10-year yield by another 30 basis points, and it has to do with the supplementary leverage ratio at banks.

So, uh, that is a good thing, not a bad thing. And they are all over that. So, when I talked about a three handle before a five handle, I wasn&#39;t joking.

      "we've just had an exciting period of time between what's going on with uh Alibaba and some of the others. And you know, it's interesting as it relates to Cooper Standard and I had a number of comments, you know, uh today like the they really enjoyed the uh CEO interview and and everything else. And I said, \"Look, you know, $2 down or $2 up really doesn't matter. The key is how we're positioned for the long-term story.\" And Cooper Standard couldn't be better positioned. And nothing has changed either really in the information, although the information's gotten a little bit better than our original thesis than um than when we originally got involved in May of 2022. It's just now all the things that we said were going to happen when no one believed it are now starting to happen and people are starting to get excited. And I think it's it's literally the early days of the early days. And when this thing turns, it turns all at once just like we saw with Alibaba. It takes years then it happens all at once just like we saw with many many others throughout the years of this podcast. So this is a very important thing."

      "Building products. This is huge news this week with uh Brad Jacobs over at QXO. He finally clinched a deal for Beacon Roofing. So he now has his platform company and this is where he will be able to work his magic as he has so many times in the past. Whether it was Waste Connections selling to Waste Management, Multibagger uh in the late 80s or early 90s, whether it was United Rentals when he got involved in 1997, if you'd put up a million dollars with him, it it's now worth $74 million. 74 Bagger. And uh XPO Logistics, if he if you had invested side by side with him, he came in 2011, he invested $150 million of his own money. uh and it was a 160 bagger that if you had uh invested $1 million you'd have 160 million and uh right now QXO he didn't invest 151 150 of his own money he's got so much conviction in this business plan he's put over a billion dollars of his own cash uh which is material and um and we're invested alongside of him so kudos to all of my investors who are now able to uh participate in that and um and the game is just beginning. So, we'll look for any opportunities to add more and take advantage because this is one that you just buy, close your eyes, and in 5 years you have a multibagger."

    "ASOS": [
      "years of experience that goes into it. Like why would I have the instinct when ASOS is fundamentals for instance? um passed through my screen. It was a little bit hairy, but why would I have the instinct to make it such a small position is because I I was very uncomfortable with the CEO and watching him talk. He&#39;s fine. He believes he believes in what he&#39;s doing. I mean, he&#39;s not trying to pull one over, but I I I&#39;ve just met these like uh these consultant types, he he&#39;s probably done his part for what he can do in terms of the easy stuff, but the next phase is probably going to require someone else. Um for us to size into it is is my guess. Um, but that that just comes from experience and seeing the types of CEOs that are full of and seeing the type of CEOs that actually get stuff done. Brad Jacobs is the exact opposite end of the of the spectrum. Little talk, lots of action, huge focuses on what&#39;s ma matters. He creates shareholder value and the rest takes care of itself. Delights his customers uh versus uh try to sound cute at investor day meetings. So um uh that that&#39;s what I would say about that. It&#39;s experience. Uh many thanks for the great work. Also great work on the interview. What do you think about forvia? Aren&#39;t the fundamentals better than Cooper Standard? All right, let&#39;s see. So these are all the people who missed Cooper Standard and didn&#39;t want to get in with us when it was at five bucks. So now they&#39;re trying to find things that are quote unquote better to catch up. So, uh, number one, this is a French company, I guess, which is probably an immediate no for me. Um, FR, unless it&#39;s LVMH, VI A. I can&#39;t find this. Uh gross margin. Let&#39;s just see here. Here we go. Description. sells techn automotive technology solutions, seating, clean mobility, electronics, lighting, vehicle seats, exhaust systems for fuel cell ccentric vehicles. No one gives a about fuel cell ccentric vehicles. Um, display technologies All right, let&#39;s take a look at the financials. It seems like it&#39;s generally okay. All right. Financial analysis return on invested capital. free cash flow. Let&#39;s take a look at the balance sheet. $10 billion of debt, five billion of cash. income statement. Why is there so much dilution here? I I hate this. They&#39;ve almost doubled their share. I mean, not their share counts up 70%. If the financials were good, I I don&#39;t like this. This this is, by the way, this is what angers me about the ASOS CEO. He deluded shareholders by about 20% because he couldn&#39;t think creatively and get the job done. So, I I hate CEOs that do this kind of stuff. So, for me, the fundamentals are great. This is So, uh, not for me. And I emphasized that on the call with Jeff and acknowledged him because if anyone should have diluted the shareholders or or almost had to during the crisis in COVID, it was him and he did not do it. Why? Because he&#39;s a partner. He owns 350,000 shares, 2% of the company. That is material. And that&#39;s why they don&#39;t screw us because they would be screwing themselves. My guess is if you look at management ownership here, uh either part of the delusion is them giving themselves all these shares. Forget it. This is a French scam. Not interested. I don&#39;t care how good the fundamentals look. When you screw the shareholders like this, go to hell. Next."

Well, that was co Well, it started crashing before CO actually. So, uh, all right. I&#39;ll take a quick look. You&#39;re you&#39;re probably going to get a bounce here, so I don&#39;t want to tell you to to pass on it, but cash flow and revenues are all turning negative. So, I&#39;m not sure that that gives me a lot of confidence. The stock price reflects it. Question is, let&#39;s take a look at quarterly. See if they&#39;re actually turning at all. I I I don&#39;t want to be involved in this. Um, all right, River. River, we&#39;re we&#39;re playing that through com stock and we have a lot of reasons and a lot of outs with that"

    "PAYPAL": [
      "momentum stocks I stay away from. So, um they really have to put in a base for a while. Like you know if you look at uh PayPal for instance you know this was another broken momentum stock and you know we were kind of waiting down here until it had bottomed for a year year and a half before we got aggressive about it uh in the low 60s and and high 50s. So, uh, I would say that we&#39;re quicker to recognize when a growth stock is broken and wait to be looking after a couple of years in here versus at the first selloff uh, in here and then having to average down before you get the recovery back. So, um, and this is a kind of a perfect example of with Cloudflare is, um, you know, and a lot of people send us stocks that are up like 20x and they just pulled back, you know, 30 or 40% and they&#39;re like, they want to jump in because they&#39;re stuck in recency bias of uh, the success. But these things, you know, when they crack, they they tend to take a because they hurt. so many institutional shareholders, it takes an awful long time to rebuild that institutional base, which is why a lot of these",
      "Like you&#39;re seeing like you saw in Baba as it built the base, like you saw in PayPal as it built the base. These people are broken mofos. They lost a lot of money because they chased up here after the 26 bagger and they bought this thinking it was cheap uh when it was a broken momentum stock. So, uh, with this one, I would, uh, I, you know, let&#39;s just take a look at the cash flow. Yeah, I mean, everything kind of looks okay. You know, 1.7 billion in debt, 500 cash. probably gonna be generally okay, but I wouldn&#39;t be in a rush. I&#39;d probably pass like if I missed the move from 60 back to 200. So, I missed it. But like if this thing languishes for a couple of years uh and builds a base and you know all the hurt people get out of the stock at the lows uh then it becomes more interesting. So that would be a lesson that I took away to answer Shavein&#39;s uh uh question which was a good one"
