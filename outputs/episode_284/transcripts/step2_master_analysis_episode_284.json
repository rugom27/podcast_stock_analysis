He anticipates a market rally through the summer, driven by factors like the unwinding of the carry trade and potential policy shifts. He emphasizes focusing on high-quality businesses and playing the 'time Arbitrage game'. He also discusses potential for a Mara Lago Accord leading to a Chinese asset price bubble.",
