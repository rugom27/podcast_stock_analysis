[115.2s] going to be playing that one a lot more
[116.92s] frequently uh two of these new buddies

[123.799s] of a friend so super excited that was a
[125.799s] lot of fun uh media want to thank
[128.84s] Christian dagger and Ashley Webster as
[132.76s] well as Stu vanney for having me on
[134.879s] vanney and Co on Friday we&#39;re going to
[136.959s] listen in here let&#39;s check the markets
[139.319s] and again we are moving lower the hour
[141.44s] 460 points down about 1% across the
[144.599s] board the nas act down just 3/4 of 8% uh
[147.44s] Thomas Hayes joins me now good morning
[149.879s] according to you Thomas hey you know if
[152.16s] you got the you know intestinal
[154.0s] fortitude you say it&#39;s time to be a
[155.8s] buyer not a
[157.68s] seller that&#39;s right Ashley as Warren
[160.04s] Buffett famous famously said when it
[162.44s] rains gold pull out a bucket not a
[164.84s] thimble there are a lot of great
[166.4s] companies on sale uh we&#39;re putting in a
[169.239s] bottom here and a bottom is messy you
[171.0s] can go down and retest the lows uh but
[173.56s] there have been 21 Corrections 10% moves
[176.92s] or more downward since 1980 and in the
[180.64s] 14 where there were no recession which
[182.72s] we believe this will be part of 6 months
[185.28s] later the Market&#39;s up 9% on average
[188.159s] we&#39;re seeing sentiment flushed out a aii
[191.0s] sentiment survey this morning there&#39;s
[192.879s] only 21% of retail investors are bullish
[196.879s] 58% are bearish but on the smart money
[200.08s] side what you&#39;re seeing is Corporate
[201.879s] insiders are buying back stock to the
[204.64s] largest extent since the lows in
[206.959s] 2022 so the the concerns is a slowing
[209.92s] economy prices remaining higher um you
[213.48s] know the dreaded stagflation uh concern
[216.76s] and with tariffs it&#39;s just uncertainty
[219.48s] at this point I mean those fears are
[221.68s] they
[223.08s] Justified well certainly they&#39;re
[224.879s] Justified but that that&#39;s what creates
[227.04s] dislocation in prices they don&#39;t give
[229.04s] away doubles for free you have to buy it
[231.12s] when everyone is selling in the hole and
[233.36s] this is one of those opportunities you
[234.959s] saw record Put buying by retail
[238.439s] investors last week they were buying
[240.159s] insurance after the house had burned
[242.079s] down you saw records selling in the hole
[244.599s] by hedge funds these are contrarian
[246.599s] indicators if you buy during these times
[249.0s] and you buy selectively and you buy high
[251.239s] quality and you look 12 months out later
[253.48s] you&#39;ve done really really
[256.12s] well and we&#39;re back uh then we&#39;re going
[259.68s] to start off with some quotes of the
[261.16s] week from Charlie Munger one of my uh
[264.8s] the great people that I look up to he
[266.759s] says a lot of success in life and
[268.6s] business comes from knowing what you
[270.08s] want to avoid I.E early death a bad
[273.44s] marriage uh Etc and uh and this is easy
[276.72s] you know a lot of people always say to
[277.68s] me gosh you look so young I was like
[279.28s] yeah I don&#39;t do drugs and I don&#39;t drink
[281.0s] much like what else do you want to know
[282.759s] so you know things you want to avoid
[285.84s] early death uh Robert arnard in
[288.68s] investing what is comfortable is rarely
[291.639s] profitable and um I think there&#39;s a
[294.479s] corollary to that which goes uh what
[298.12s] starts uncomfortable comes very uncom
[301.24s] becomes very comfortable over time as
[304.0s] we&#39;ve seen in many of the names Through
[305.8s] The Years here on hedge fund tips with
[307.68s] Tom Hayes uh and then David teer in
[310.96s] order to get that Comfort what do you
[312.44s] need to do the key is to wait sometimes
[315.84s] the hardest thing to do is to do nothing
[320.4s] and uh that&#39;s key and that&#39;s why having
[322.44s] a good hobby like golf comes in handy uh
[325.479s] when you&#39;re tempted by the devil of
[328.28s] activity you want to get into to
[330.08s] inactivity when you&#39;ve bought right and
[332.36s] you&#39;ve bought quality at good prices you
[334.759s] just wait and play the time Arbitrage
[337.319s] game and that is a unique advantage in
[339.6s] the market also the hats uh first of all

[412.68s] this is all opinion not advice so uh
[416.8s] let&#39;s go through some charts we haven&#39;t
[418.36s] done in a while relative performance of
[421.479s] sectors I think this has been a unique
[423.68s] year that caught a lot of people by
[426.599s] surprise but no one on the hedge fund
[430.28s] tips with Tom Hayes Money Train was
[433.24s] taken by surprise because uh you were
[436.199s] ready the last shall be first and they
[438.28s] were you can see here uh reach
[441.4s] outperformed the S&amp;P 500 year to date uh
[446.12s] Chinese stocks outperform the S&amp;P
[448.4s] dramatically year to date by the way
[450.68s] this is a secular
[452.599s] turn um uh you know similar to what we
[456.479s] saw 2016 to 2018 then you know 2019 to
[463.319s] 2021 and here we&#39;ve put in even bigger
[466.039s] base the the longer the base the higher
[468.84s] the space and uh this is just getting
[471.28s] going then we&#39;ve got uh bonds have
[473.879s] outperformed the S&amp;P year to date uh
[477.4s] that took a lot of people by surprise no
[478.919s] one here
[479.96s] uh biotech we love this setup here
[483.199s] putting in the bottom just like we saw
[484.96s] here in 2020 you had a bottom kind of a
[488.199s] double bottom type of her or reverse
[490.08s] Head and Shoulders however you want to
[491.24s] look at it I think biotech is poised to
[494.159s] Rocket we&#39;re going to look at some of
[495.879s] that then uh materials outperform the
[498.879s] S&amp;P all the stuff that we talked about
[500.8s] if you remember from our last Shelby
[502.36s] first you can find all the old posts on
[504.639s] hedge fund tips with Tom Hayes just go
[507.159s] down to commentary you can see of our
[509.879s] weekly articles going back five some OD
[512.479s] years or you can just go to video cast
[515.12s] here under categories and see every
[517.479s] single video cast uh or podcast if you
[520.68s] like to
[522.36s] listen uh communication Services looks
[525.6s] like it&#39;s stalling out relative to the
[527.68s] S&amp;P uh energy okay you remember go back
[531.8s] to the podcast in 2020 when oil was
[534.399s] negative we were buying like crazy here
[537.44s] we had more pain and then they just just
[539.64s] took off like crazy I remember buying
[542.399s] Exxon at $33 when oil was negative and
[545.2s] pounding the table on the podcast went a
[547.6s] little against us before it went off
[549.399s] took absolutely took off and then we
[551.32s] were laying off in
[552.8s] 2022 and everyone was getting excited
[555.48s] about it and they basically done nothing
[558.279s] since um so now it looks like it wants
[560.92s] to take another leg higher energy is
[563.68s] again we continue to pay attention to we
[565.519s] continue to have exposure through
[566.88s] Comstock which has been a home run uh
[569.839s] probably be a three bagger within within
[572.2s] a few months from where we bought uh
[574.2s] already two plus and uh just beginning
[577.12s] with that one financials relative to the
[579.32s] S&amp;P has had the huge run we laid off a
[582.079s] lot we still have some Regional exposure
[584.72s] I think on the next major rally we&#39;re
[586.399s] going to take that off uh believe it or
[589.64s] not so we were able to take off the
[591.32s] banks in the summer uh after a huge run
[594.2s] in city and Bank of America after the
[596.399s] March remember the March mini banking
[598.56s] crisis we were hand over fist uh and we
[601.76s] took off uh over the summer so let&#39;s see
[604.04s] what happens with that um but we&#39;re
[606.68s] waiting for the next big rally to get
[608.32s] rid of
[609.2s] regionals uh xli at a very nice profit
[613.8s] xli industrial starting to outperform
[616.6s] relative to so we look at this to find
[620.24s] sectors we want to drill down on to find
[624.04s] Opportunities and the key with the
[626.72s] opportunities is I think what most
[628.36s] people is they&#39;re
[630.36s] they like a a normal business person&#39;s
[633.44s] mindset is you get paid for activity
[635.399s] Massive Action equals massive results
[637.279s] and I think a lot of people just get
[639.16s] distracted by the new shiny object uh
[643.04s] and rather than holding to great quality
[645.0s] businesses unless something has changed
[647.44s] in our thesis if we have a new idea it
[650.44s] has to be so much better than an
[652.56s] existing idea in the portfolio to take
[654.279s] something out that has hasn&#39;t yet
[656.24s] reached full intrinsic value the the the
[659.6s] we determined prior to entering the
[661.6s] position in order to replace it so um uh
[666.24s] but anyway Tech has underperformed
[668.959s] relative to the S&amp;P no surprise to us
[671.12s] surprise to many uh Staples have
[673.639s] outperformed we got a they got a little
[676.24s] defensive um you know we like a little
[679.399s] exposure there through the baers of the
[681.68s] world through the horels of the world
[683.959s] but nothing crazy and um same thing with
[687.32s] utilities this is all going to be a
[689.32s] function of rates continuing to go lower
[691.6s] we&#39;ll talk about that which we have
[693.16s] Healthcare same story a defensive
[696.079s] starting to outperform Baxter I think
[698.48s] biotech is going to pick up into that
[700.72s] very quickly discretionary has
[702.88s] absolutely rolled over with consumer
[704.72s] sentiment relative to the S&amp;P there&#39;s
[706.88s] going to be some opportunity to buy some
[708.68s] stuff there and that&#39;s how we kind of an
[711.36s] overview then we look at bullish
[713.16s] percentage these are the percentage of
[715.56s] stocks in the sector on a point and
[717.48s] figure
[721.8s] Buy Signal we don&#39;t use point and figure
[724.44s] but this is a useful indicator to see
[726.24s] different sectors we have found
[728.2s] communication Services already started
[729.92s] to rebound uh NASDAQ composit starting
[733.16s] to rebound there&#39;s opportunity there
[734.72s] like I said in previous media interviews
[737.959s] uh Tech and mag 7 are going to bounce I
[739.92s] do think they&#39;re going to underperform
[741.199s] for the year maybe trade back up to the
[743.04s] top of the range which most people are
[744.8s] going to say see they&#39;re the best blah
[746.399s] blah blah and then they&#39;ll stall out
[747.839s] again uh consumer discretionary I think
[750.36s] there&#39;s a lot to do here the VF Corps of
[752.519s] the world Nike if we didn&#39;t own VF Corp
[755.24s] but Nike has a little bit bigger in
[759.04s] other words Nike is where VF Corp was a
[762.36s] year and a half ago when we got involved
[764.199s] with Brack and
[765.279s] Daryl um I think it&#39;s going to take a
[768.279s] little longer than people expect but I
[769.839s] think Nike will be back over time uh
[772.6s] just not yet and not as soon as most
[774.6s] people think uh energy again uh starting
[778.68s] to move move gold miners don&#39;t really
[781.36s] care healthc care opportunity there you
[785.16s] know I keep looking at the fisers of the
[786.88s] world and uh continue to pass we have
[789.72s] exposure through biotech and through
[792.399s] Baxter um bullish industry Industrials
[795.839s] this is just getting started the generx
[798.88s] the uh boeings well yeah boeings the um
[803.639s] Stanley Black and Deckers this is all
[805.399s] going to be the way with the
[806.079s] construction trade which we&#39;re going to
[807.199s] spend some time on and it&#39;s funny I&#39;ve
[811.32s] had in my mind two conflicting thoughts
[815.0s] and that&#39;s very common uh as you get
[817.92s] experienced in the business and the the
[820.279s] the one thought is that the economy is
[822.639s] going to continue to do really really
[824.36s] well for the next five years because of
[826.24s] the Baby Boomers because of certain
[827.92s] policies because of a lot of different
[829.92s] things um uh we can expect material
[834.279s] strength at least for another 5 years
[836.519s] before we get a lost decade probably 10
[838.759s] years 8 to 10 years but
[842.519s] um at the same
[848.48s] time I&#39;m in Orange County and I&#39;m I&#39;m
[853.519s] thinking about real estate
[855.72s] here and I continue to say this this
[858.72s] just feels
[863.32s] bubbleisha reset and I&#39;m saying to
[866.12s] myself well how can this possibly be
[868.6s] when we have hous housing shortage of
[870.519s] 3.8 million units how are prices ever
[873.44s] going to come down like part of me is
[875.24s] okay the Chinese own 11% of the housing
[877.48s] stock now that everything&#39;s going back
[878.88s] up in China they&#39;re going to get fomo
[880.44s] they&#39;re going to stop pushing their
[881.48s] money out of uh China and the marginal
[884.44s] bid the marginal buyer in Orange County
[886.88s] and some of these cities around the
[888.12s] country is going to
[890.199s] evaporate and when that evaporates you
[892.279s] hit an air pocket and you get a reset
[894.639s] and the economy can still be strong even
[896.36s] if that resets and that that&#39;s that&#39;s
[899.04s] part of the thesis we&#39;re going to get to
[900.92s] some policy things that may yield a
[905.04s] booming
[906.32s] economy and
[909.8s] either consolidating home prices meaning
[913.0s] they can just run sideways for many
[914.88s] years and not go up uh or actually
[917.36s] correcting home prices but not
[919.839s] correcting in a way where you wind up
[921.92s] with a 2008 once in a 100y year event
[924.56s] correcting in a way like it got ahead of
[926.759s] itself because of Co and some un natural
[929.36s] government intervention that needs to be
[931.68s] flushed through uh and the overall
[934.04s] economy can continue to flourish so
[935.56s] that&#39;s where we see the industrial
[937.6s] opportunity uh Tech again these are
[940.079s] going to bounce there&#39;s a lot to do
[941.56s] there we&#39;ve got a bunch of exposure uh
[944.319s] and then
[945.16s] materials uh this one I think there&#39;s
[948.0s] immense opportunities we&#39;ve got albam
[949.68s] Maro I think that&#39;s going to be a
[950.88s] monster for us uh relatively new
[953.56s] position and then
[956.079s] um nysse is starting to bounce these are
[959.279s] kind of more the industrial
[962.279s] names real estate bounced pulling back a
[965.759s] little bit you&#39;re going to see the CCIS
[968.12s] of the world in the reach continue to
[970.6s] Rally uh bullish percent SPX I think
[974.16s] this is I think you know I&#39;ve said it on
[976.519s] the media for the last week or so and
[978.88s] Market probably bottomed a couple weeks
[980.519s] ago tried to go back and retest didn&#39;t
[982.8s] quite do it I I think we put the bottom
[984.639s] in and uh I&#39;m super glad for the new
[986.959s] people that have come in uh now that
[989.68s] their money&#39;s getting to work right away
[991.8s] because I think we&#39;re going to be
[993.079s] straight up to the summer as I had said
[995.319s] and yes I know we have uh April 2nd
[997.959s] looming so we&#39;ll keep some dry powder to
[1000.399s] put money to work if some crazy thing
[1002.319s] happens but if you look at most of the
[1003.959s] stocks that are going to be affected by
[1006.199s] it um they&#39;ve kind of you know this is
[1009.24s] like this is going to be the biggest
[1010.8s] known surprise in humanity I think it&#39;s
[1012.72s] going to be the sell the rumor by the
[1014.319s] news scenario all over again and most
[1017.639s] people are think they have some Edge
[1019.44s] like tariffs are coming like who the
[1021.319s] hell has not heard about that like turn
[1023.72s] on your local news Fox 5 you don&#39;t need
[1026.959s] to turn on Fox Business for that uh all
[1029.799s] you need to do is have a heartbeat and
[1031.4s] you know that that&#39;s coming which means
[1033.679s] if everyone knows it it&#39;s probably
[1035.72s] priced and if you look at most of the
[1037.039s] industrial stocks uh and Auto Part
[1039.319s] suppliers and everything else uh you
[1041.839s] know a lot of that&#39;s priced so when it
[1043.439s] actually happens or if it happens you
[1045.799s] know less than expected uh there&#39;s only
[1049.36s] upside downsides kind of priced in and
[1051.2s] that that&#39;s our our based case and you
[1053.16s] know you get the Bears that&#39;ll all say
[1055.16s] oh the Market&#39;s being too conservative
[1057.039s] maybe in the short term maybe you get
[1058.72s] some short-term volatility but uh that&#39;s
[1061.36s] that&#39;s not how we think about it the
[1062.919s] businesses that we
[1064.64s] buy uh and I always say you can&#39;t invest
[1067.039s] over things you have no control so the
[1069.679s] businesses that we buy the demand for
[1072.16s] the items and the competitive Moes that
[1075.32s] they have are going to be unchanged
[1078.12s] irrespective of how much of that gets
[1080.2s] passed through the consumer there&#39;s
[1081.559s] there is a fixed amount of demand that&#39;s
[1083.32s] not going to go away now could it hurt
[1085.44s] at the margins for a few weeks or or a
[1087.64s] couple of quarters sure but it&#39;s not
[1089.64s] going to change share because their
[1091.919s] competitors are all going to have the
[1094.039s] same climate that they have to operate
[1096.4s] in so therefore it&#39;s a short-term reset
[1099.64s] for a long-term reward if you get the
[1101.64s] worst case scenario and if you don&#39;t
[1103.679s] then it&#39;s just massive money made to the
[1105.64s] upside overnight and no one gets let in
[1107.88s] so uh you know take your risk like
[1110.52s] modest down downside
[1112.84s] volatility uh because of a a knee-jerk
[1115.28s] reaction in the short term versus
[1117.799s] massive upside if it&#39;s slightly worse
[1120.159s] than expected or it&#39;s known and then the
[1123.24s] weakest hands that haven&#39;t been turning
[1125.36s] on the local news get finally get
[1127.36s] flushed uh we take their shares from
[1129.679s] them and then we we go straight up so I
[1132.88s] think that&#39;s kind of the environment
[1134.36s] here here are a bunch of charts that
[1136.679s] we&#39;ve uh some names that we&#39;ve discussed
[1139.159s] over time and what&#39;s so exciting and
[1141.36s] beautiful as we go through these is
[1143.84s] there you know the the window has closed
[1147.159s] there&#39;s no question that this once in a
[1149.2s] 100e opportunity to put money to work is
[1152.44s] getting narrower and narrower as a lot
[1154.44s] of our names have taken off but there
[1156.72s] are still such
[1159.799s] beautiful generational and when I say
[1161.919s] generational some of these are once in
[1163.6s] 20 years but a lot of them are once in
[1165.12s] 10 or 15 years uh and that&#39;s a lot of
[1168.12s] time to get you know to be able to buy
[1171.84s] it at such amazing prices and get
[1173.32s] doubles triples quadruples over the next
[1174.96s] handful of years and that that Windows
[1176.799s] pretty much closing so um I want to
[1180.039s] congratulate all the uh people who&#39;ve
[1182.28s] come in the last just week and a half
[1185.159s] Alone um and um and many of you have
[1188.36s] already been approved by interactive
[1189.88s] brokers I don&#39;t know what they&#39;re doing
[1190.919s] over there but they&#39;ve got their act
[1192.28s] together and you know these applications
[1193.919s] are getting approved in uh you know day
[1197.2s] or two versus a week which is exciting
[1200.08s] and funded so we&#39;re going to get get
[1201.679s] money to work now get money to work
[1203.4s] after uh April 2nd and and rock and roll
[1207.0s] so but you can see I mean yes Baba a lot
[1210.0s] of people miss that I mean it&#39;s going a
[1212.12s] lot higher there&#39;s no question about it
[1214.2s] but you know we&#39;re now up
[1216.4s] 120% off the lows so um you know
[1220.679s] hopefully for those of you who don&#39;t
[1222.24s] have enough exposure if you&#39;re lucky
[1224.679s] you&#39;ll get you know High 120s to get
[1226.84s] back in maybe mid10
[1229.32s] but don&#39;t hold your breath this thing
[1230.96s] the train has left the station we told
[1232.679s] you that would be happening that&#39;s
[1234.2s] already happened all these other names
[1236.12s] that you guys are pessimistic on they&#39;re
[1238.24s] next so if you thought this was a
[1240.44s] surprise which you shouldn&#39;t think it&#39;s
[1242.28s] a damn surprise because we spent two
[1244.159s] years telling you what was going to
[1245.4s] happen uh just wait till you see the
[1247.64s] next batch and what&#39;s going to take
[1249.6s] place and it&#39;s so funny I had some new
[1251.919s] clients like I&#39;ve been listening to you
[1254.64s] for over a year I thought I knew how you
[1257.48s] invested I had no idea I&#39;m looking at
[1259.799s] the portfolio he&#39;s like I would have
[1261.28s] never figured this out I was like well
[1264.6s] you know what else do you want me to
[1266.24s] tell you uh you know that that the
[1269.679s] you&#39;re a client now it&#39;s a different
[1271.24s] game so uh anyway so
[1274.44s] Baxter um you know again this is a
[1278.52s] defensive stock they take a you know
[1280.679s] year year and a half two years to base
[1282.64s] every cycle here we are and then it just
[1285.08s] goes straight up and it recaptures new
[1286.76s] highs why because it has a moat the IV
[1289.76s] business it&#39;s the switching costs are
[1292.039s] high their pumps are fantastic and they
[1295.039s] got rid of the lowquality business the
[1296.799s] low growth business called the kidney
[1298.2s] business and you can&#39;t give it away and
[1300.08s] that&#39;s what happens right before they go
[1301.279s] to the room now today on Cooper standard
[1303.2s] everyone&#39;s nervous about the tariffs I I
[1305.48s] pray to God we get a 15 handle because I
[1308.48s] really didn&#39;t want to put new clients in
[1310.24s] this thing at 17 bucks even though it&#39;s
[1312.44s] going a lot higher over the next few
[1314.48s] years uh so I pray to God we get some
[1317.039s] serious fear in the next week and I can
[1319.48s] get a 154 handle on this and do one
[1323.279s] final absolute load the boat but I don&#39;t
[1327.799s] think we&#39;re going to get it so we&#39;ll see
[1330.36s] uh
[1331.279s] Disney uh Disney I like here I I would
[1334.6s] put new money to work but
[1336.799s] um uh you know this is going to take a
[1339.279s] few years and it&#39;s going to work its way
[1340.84s] back to New highs and Beyond uh PayPal
[1344.799s] uh or gen rather so look you bought in
[1347.44s] the 90s wrote up to to 195 that&#39;s great
[1350.6s] this is the beginning this is the next
[1352.48s] phase this is what it does so if you
[1354.12s] look back to
[1355.48s] 2016 same exact thing you know you get
[1358.24s] this Panic selloff Fountain double check
[1361.64s] then you rally up everyone gets excited
[1364.6s] gets in at 195 you smoke them out you
[1367.4s] drop 33% and then you just start to move
[1370.48s] up to the next major major move so 3
[1373.64s] years from now this thing&#39;s going to be
[1375.559s] a ton higher uh a lot of people probably
[1378.799s] got knocked out here I would put new
[1380.039s] money to work here for
[1381.88s] sure um and probably will Intel lip
[1387.6s] bhan we&#39;re going to cover some of that
[1389.72s] today this is going to be fantastic
[1393.72s] that&#39;s all I can tell you uh small caps
[1397.08s] final breather before the move
[1399.2s] higher um Banks I think we&#39;re going to
[1401.88s] get another rally here we&#39;ll probably
[1403.6s] lay off on the next rally PayPal same
[1407.679s] exact story you come out of these lows
[1409.919s] you get the check backs scare everyone
[1412.12s] out and then you take your next leg
[1414.6s] higher this time just like we saw with
[1417.0s] Baba by the way this this is this is
[1419.559s] standard Fair ladies and gentlemen
[1421.679s] because you just get the dumb money that
[1423.24s] come in right after you have the massive
[1425.08s] rallies then you take them all out and
[1426.799s] then you take the next huge leg up and
[1428.88s] then they&#39;ll buy up here at 160 take it
[1431.159s] back to 140 before you let them off the
[1434.84s] bus and then you go straight to 200 plus
[1437.159s] and that&#39;s the way the game works so
[1442.36s] um all right where were
[1446.039s] we PayPal this is a home run uh this
[1449.2s] this I&#39;m putting new money to work for
[1450.64s] sure uh Stanley Black and&amp; Decker this
[1452.919s] is the most leveraged play on the
[1454.559s] housing recovery which I&#39;m going to tell
[1456.0s] you why is coming to a theater near you
[1458.08s] very quickly I love this
[1459.919s] play um bonds double head and shoulders
[1464.48s] bottom here started to Rally beginning
[1467.08s] of the year we&#39;ll consolid a little bit
[1469.08s] they&#39;re going to continue to rally for
[1471.399s] the foreseeable future which helps all
[1473.6s] of our thesis whether it be at home
[1475.279s] builders and uh we talked about last
[1477.76s] year with last week with what Scott
[1480.0s] Besson is doing on the um Capital
[1483.2s] charges for banks removing some of those
[1486.679s] restrictions uh is going to lower the 10
[1488.76s] year by another 30 basis points takes it
[1491.72s] on three takes 10e mortgages under six
[1494.36s] and you have not seen anything like a
[1496.6s] housing boom of what you&#39;re going to see
[1497.919s] over the next five years in terms of
[1499.52s] Supply so what how do we want to play
[1502.2s] that again do we want you know just like
[1504.679s] the pent up demand in cars do we want to
[1506.48s] be the one fighting the war where these
[1509.6s] car companies oems are going to be
[1511.399s] fighting against each other for share
[1513.0s] and discounting and offering incentives
[1515.36s] no we want to be the Arms Dealer like
[1517.12s] Cooper standard selling a ceiling as
[1519.679s] they as they lower prices and volumes go
[1521.44s] through the roof with a 13 and a half
[1523.24s] year uh average car on the road let them
[1526.32s] kill each other overprice we&#39;re going to
[1527.799s] sell them the the weapons which is which
[1529.44s] is the ceiling and the fluid transfer
[1531.399s] systems and we&#39;re we get paid on volumes
[1534.08s] it&#39;s going to be the same with the
[1535.08s] housing the home builders um are going
[1538.0s] to be producing tons and tons and tons
[1539.88s] of houses with all the new land
[1542.24s] available to build and uh the ones that
[1544.799s] are going to benefit are going to be the
[1548.399s] um uh homeb Building Supplies
[1551.72s] Distributors and those type of
[1553.88s] businesses like qxo with Brad Jacobs
[1556.679s] which we own and uh had had an
[1559.6s] opportunity to be able to participate in
[1562.48s] the early days that is one that you just
[1564.96s] buy and you wake up in eight years and
[1567.039s] you&#39;ve got a seven to 10 bagger I mean
[1569.159s] that&#39;s how Brad Jacob rolls and uh the
[1571.76s] guy&#39;s a winner he knows how how to do a
[1574.279s] creative Acquisitions he knows how
[1577.24s] to add technology value ad to drive
[1580.6s] profits synergies and then he knows how
[1582.88s] to play the multiple Arbitrage games so
[1584.84s] yes he paid up for Beacon but you can
[1587.12s] you can be sure tucks and
[1590.44s] um
[1593.799s] um Acquisitions in a fragmented Market
[1596.6s] he&#39;s going to be able to buy at lower
[1598.039s] multiples and get the public market
[1600.039s] multiple um Arbitrage and it&#39;s going to
[1603.08s] be fantastic so excited for that VF Corp
[1606.72s] same exact story every single cycle
[1608.679s] rallies off the lows checks back takes
[1611.0s] everyone off the bus and then goes back
[1612.64s] on to new highs same thing here rallies
[1616.159s] makes everyone doubt it and then back to
[1618.24s] to new highs so it takes a little while
[1619.6s] to consolidate and Brad uh Brack and
[1622.279s] Daryl&#39;s going to take this thing back up
[1623.64s] to new highs and it&#39;s going to be you
[1625.2s] know a handful of years but off of a 13
[1628.08s] $15 basis you&#39;re going to wind up with a
[1630.88s] seven bagger so I mean you know uh or
[1635.0s] you can just switch to the next shiny
[1636.52s] object and keep missing great
[1638.159s] opportunities uh biotech same thing
[1640.679s] every cycle you get this bottoming
[1643.24s] another fake out like we had last year
[1645.36s] then you rally up fake them one last
[1647.799s] time and then you another parabolic move
[1650.399s] so 130 140 would not surprise me in a
[1653.919s] reasonable amount of
[1655.399s] time okay chart of the week let&#39;s see
[1658.679s] where we are I thought this was going to
[1660.12s] be a short one because we had them by
[1661.76s] the way if you missed the amazing
[1663.559s] interview with Jeff Edwards CEO of
[1666.64s] Cooper standard last week be sure to
[1668.36s] check in either at our YouTube station
[1671.0s] just go to YouTube and enter hedge fund
[1673.2s] tips uh or uh hedge fund tips with Tom
[1677.159s] Hayes podcast episode
[1680.159s] 283 was phenomenal so let&#39;s talk about
[1683.6s] CTA uh positioning in US
[1686.6s] equities they got this low in the hole
[1689.96s] in 2022 they got this low in uh the
[1693.519s] covid lows when we were pounding the
[1695.36s] table to buy uh in Fall of 2023 all of
[1699.0s] these were great buying opportunities
[1700.32s] they&#39;re down at these levels now that&#39;s
[1701.88s] the reason we&#39;ve been talking this is
[1703.919s] very interesting the road from
[1706.36s] Plaza the Plaza to Mar Lago the dollars
[1709.399s] approaching valuations hit in
[1711.88s] 1985 this is super important because uh
[1715.679s] this was Reagan&#39;s second term first year
[1718.72s] of second term just like it&#39;s Trump
[1720.36s] first year of second term uh dollar was
[1723.08s] weak they wanted they excuse me the
[1725.32s] dollar was record strong they wanted it
[1727.84s] weak and they met at the plaza it was
[1731.64s] named after the Plaza Hotel in New York
[1734.12s] City um which uh I think oddly enough I
[1738.799s] don&#39;t know if Trump owned it at that
[1742.0s] time that&#39;s kind of funny I think he
[1744.159s] owned it at that time uh anyway they
[1747.32s] came to an agreement between France West
[1750.48s] Germany Japan United Kingdom the United
[1752.48s] States to depreciate the US dollar in
[1754.679s] relationship to the Frank the Deutsch
[1757.279s] Mark the Yen and the British pound
[1758.72s] sterling by intervening in currency
[1760.519s] markets the dollar depreciated
[1762.44s] significantly from the time of the
[1764.399s] agreement until it was replaced by the
[1766.0s] Lou Ray Accord the Lou Accord in
[1769.799s] 1987 uh some commentators believe the
[1772.6s] plaza Accord continued to contributed to
[1776.88s] let me highlight this so you guys don&#39;t
[1778.32s] miss it contributed to the Japanese
[1781.559s] asset price bubble of the late 1980s
[1784.64s] ladies and gentlemen I&#39;m going to step
[1787.32s] out on a limb here and say if there
[1790.799s] there are Rumblings about a Mara Lago
[1794.76s] Accord okay and there is obviously Trump
[1798.039s] Trump has shown his hand that he wants a
[1802.12s] weaker dollar to give us an advantage
[1804.96s] with trade with paying off the debt with
[1806.96s] everything else that comes down to it if
[1809.159s] they were to negotiate
[1811.72s] a maral Lago Accord and depreciate the
[1816.08s] US dollar this would not contribute to a
[1818.919s] Japanese asset price bubble over the
[1820.88s] next four years this would contribute to
[1823.399s] a Chinese asset price bubble of the late
[1827.039s] 20
[1829.24s] 22s and I think that all of the pieces
[1832.76s] of the puzzle are coming together that
[1834.679s] this would not surprise me at all and I
[1837.2s] think this could be the fuel for the
[1840.44s] last parabolic move in China before they
[1843.679s] come to two three lost decades like the
[1846.64s] Japanese have due to demographic
[1849.36s] miscalculations that cannot be Unwound
[1852.48s] in the next decade plus so um and and
[1857.519s] and that would certainly cause the
[1859.6s] marginal bid in using US housing
[1861.919s] certainly in areas like Orange County to
[1864.44s] evaporate um and cause a major air
[1867.72s] pocket because if everything is going up
[1869.559s] around them they&#39;re not going to pay the
[1871.6s] friction uh and the risk of getting
[1874.039s] additional money out of the country
[1876.039s] they&#39;ll keep what they got out of China
[1879.24s] here uh because it&#39;s so hard to get it
[1881.44s] out but when you&#39;ve got more opportunity
[1883.96s] domestically and you got friction to get
[1887.36s] money out to to a place where the
[1888.6s] opportunities are not as good in the
[1890.72s] short term uh all you have to do is look
[1893.639s] at people&#39;s incentives and you know how
[1895.44s] they&#39;re going to act but um this is
[1899.2s] setting up
[1900.84s] very very similarly so keep an eye on
[1903.76s] the mara logo Accord moving forward

[2049.639s] we&#39;re forcing them to do business away
[2051.919s] from us uh and to learn how to do it
[2055.24s] themselves and they&#39;ve done it a lot
[2056.879s] sooner than we could have imagined if we
[2058.879s] we had kept them dependent on our chips
[2062.639s] uh they would be a decade behind as we

[2099.72s] $23.96 most of you have basy well better
[2103.88s] than the CEO of the company and you
[2106.44s] probably still have a very limited
[2108.04s] window to lock that in talk about
[2111.04s] aligned interest with a partner super
[2114.44s] exciting news Bank of America mortgage
[2116.599s] applications jumped 80% in q1 says the
[2119.64s] executive which is kind of interesting
[2121.88s] when you think about consumer sentiment
[2123.599s] was in the gutter Etc but you had a few
[2125.76s] weeks there where mortgage rates came
[2127.28s] down wait till they drop below six and
[2130.32s] this thing goes all in this is what I&#39;m
[2134.079s] talking about Trump moves forward with
[2135.96s] plans to use federal land to build
[2137.839s] affordable housing so Nationwide the
[2141.72s] federal government owns about 1 million
[2144.359s] square miles of land or about 27% of the
[2148.24s] country&#39;s total land area the new
[2150.64s] initiative will focus on the roughly 500
[2153.0s] million Acres managed by the department
[2155.24s] of the interior which oversees National
[2157.44s] Park Parks and Wildlife
[2160.88s] refugees so you will get not only a
[2165.119s] beautiful 1800 squ foot home by KB Homes
[2168.24s] but an endangered elk in your backyard
[2170.56s] free of charge all right uh joking not
[2173.599s] joking so
[2176.56s] um so here&#39;s the deal this announ this
[2179.599s] announcement follows a recent report
[2180.88s] from realor.com which found that the
[2183.28s] industry has a housing Supply gap of at
[2185.599s] least $3.8 million units at the current
[2189.24s] pace of construction it would take more
[2190.76s] than seven years for Supply to catch up
[2193.359s] with
[2194.04s] demand
[2197.64s] um in the joint oped in the Wall Street
[2200.44s] Journal bergam and Turner said that the
[2202.359s] inter agency task force would work to
[2204.16s] reduce red tape associated with building
[2206.56s] on Federal Land and cut through the
[2208.4s] bureaucracy to Spur new Housing
[2212.76s] Development so what they&#39;re basically
[2215.56s] saying
[2217.96s] is that we&#39;ve had so much trouble in
[2220.56s] municipalities because people don&#39;t want
[2222.52s] crowding in their own backyard that
[2224.72s] we&#39;re going to just open up this land
[2226.119s] and build there&#39;s another aspect because
[2229.319s] they really struggle in the suburbs more
[2231.04s] than they do in the cities people don&#39;t
[2232.24s] move into the cities because they want
[2234.119s] to be by themselves they move into the
[2235.8s] city because they want proximity they
[2237.88s] want people around them Etc there&#39;s
[2239.72s] another thing that they&#39;re going to do
[2241.4s] with some of the tax credits in the
[2243.16s] cities to force the local uh politicians
[2247.2s] to to cut the red tape so I think you&#39;re
[2248.96s] going to get greater density in the
[2250.44s] cities and I think you&#39;re going to get
[2252.04s] greater density in the excerts uh where
[2254.64s] these Federal lands are where they can
[2256.68s] build massive amounts of houses now that
[2258.52s] a lot of people can work hybrid and and
[2260.4s] that type of thing and businesses will
[2261.72s] pop up just like they did in the suburbs
[2264.16s] uh in the 80s
[2266.4s] so uh we will open up portions of
[2268.56s] federal land for large large scale
[2270.8s] housing construction these zones will be
[2272.44s] ultra low tax ultra low regulation we
[2275.119s] are going to open our country to
[2276.2s] building homes inexpensively young
[2278.0s] people uh and other people can buy homes
[2280.92s] so two things are going to happen one
[2284.28s] you get the Chinese marginal buyer in
[2287.319s] the expensive areas evaporating because
[2289.4s] there&#39;s more opportunities in the short
[2290.88s] term in China to make more money in a
[2292.599s] shorter amount of time number
[2297.4s] two you&#39;re going to get the opening of
[2300.599s] the federal land 500 million acres to
[2303.04s] build these 3.8
[2304.96s] million um and number three
[2316.359s] is we&#39;re going to get to in just a
[2318.72s] minute is
[2322.64s] basically
[2325.04s] here the City Journal piece from Christ
[2328.56s] Christopher Elmendorf and Alex
[2332.72s] arich and he said uh Trump ordered uh
[2336.16s] his departments on day one to deliver
[2337.96s] emergency price relief including action
[2339.8s] to lower the cost of housing and expand
[2341.319s] the housing
[2342.44s] Supply so what they&#39;re proposing is how
[2346.56s] housing is too expensive because its
[2348.44s] development is overregulation yet the
[2350.68s] regulations that drive up housing costs
[2352.2s] Arcane local zoning and building codes
[2354.16s] are not the kinds that Congressional
[2356.0s] Republicans are best to fight however
[2357.92s] many of the local codes protect Suburban
[2361.28s] single family home neighborhoods and a
[2364.079s] residential ideal that Trump has
[2365.96s] pointedly defended in a new paper we
[2368.56s] suggest one way out of this dilemma
[2371.44s] Target big expensive cities for housing
[2375.359s] growth while letting States decide for
[2377.88s] themselves what to do about the suburbs
[2380.8s] specifically we propose to reallocate
[2383.68s] Federal affordable housing tax credits A
[2386.8s] roughly $15 billion subsidy away from
[2390.72s] the nation&#39;s biggest most expensive
[2393.04s] cities unless they adopt a basic set of
[2396.68s] pro housing reform specifically to
[2399.2s] retain their eligibility for the federal
[2400.96s] affordable housing subsidy these cities
[2403.16s] would have to allow development of
[2404.64s] apartment and condo buildings along
[2406.76s] major corridors and in commercial areas
[2409.92s] cap development fees at $10,000 per new
[2412.52s] unit roughly the national average wave
[2415.24s] provide waivers from Price controls that
[2417.24s] render a project infeasible and approve
[2421.359s] projects that conform to applicable
[2423.52s] standards
[2425.2s] ministerially that is without discre
[2427.319s] discretionary reviews and Associated
[2429.4s] conditions of approval that may change a
[2431.48s] Project&#39;s design or increase its cost
[2434.44s] Congress should also task a federal
[2436.28s] agency with developing criteria for
[2438.52s] measuring City&#39;s housing performance
[2440.64s] such as housing stock growth relative to
[2442.48s] potential growth given prices and
[2444.4s] partial characteristics persistently
[2446.079s] poor performers should lose their
[2448.4s] eligibility for federal subsidies
[2450.319s] regardless of whether they have opted
[2452.119s] into the Federal Pro housing reforms our
[2454.76s] proposal is Bud budget neutral and State
[2457.44s] neutral this is important if a city like
[2459.8s] New York chooses not to relax its
[2462.04s] regulations the tax credits it foregoes
[2465.319s] would flow to affordable housing
[2467.079s] projects elsewhere in the state the new
[2469.599s] agency uh the new policy would put
[2471.64s] significant pressure on Big City
[2473.28s] governments to develop pro- housing
[2475.16s] reforms since Progressive City Council
[2477.319s] Members won&#39;t want to be seen forfeiting
[2480.24s] affordable housing funds the suburbs
[2483.16s] would be unaffected however as the new
[2485.88s] policy would apply only to big expensive
[2489.2s] cities so you basically bracket it the
[2491.599s] suburbs where everyone&#39;s nimi not in my
[2494.319s] backyard let them let them have what
[2497.72s] they want you&#39;ve got 500 million of
[2500.48s] federal lands that&#39;s going to be all in
[2502.599s] massive production and then now you
[2504.8s] force the cities into it which um really
[2509.16s] really could be effective and that&#39;s how
[2510.88s] I think we get
[2513.16s] a renewed affordability and housing in a
[2516.88s] Rel relatively short period of time so
[2518.8s] again we&#39;ve got to find some ways to
[2520.359s] play the arms dealers and I think the
[2523.2s] number one company to start with and I
[2527.2s] and and I&#39;ve got a lot more on on my
[2529.079s] radar is going to be qxo okay which we
[2532.319s] have a nice position from lower levels
[2534.28s] and we are going to uh hopefully be able
[2537.52s] to use any opportunities to get
[2541.68s] more and set and forget for a long time
[2545.28s] because he&#39;s he&#39;s going to be in the
[2546.48s] game in a major way and an effective way
[2549.319s] so these are the Articles you can see
[2551.04s] here this shows where all the federal
[2553.28s] land
[2554.52s] is yellow is Bureau of Land Management
[2557.319s] it&#39;s mostly in the
[2558.76s] west
[2560.839s] um Bureau of Indian
[2564.599s] Affairs Department of Defense fish and
[2567.839s] wildlife Service Forest Service etc etc
[2570.64s] etc so this is where you&#39;re going to see
[2573.16s] huge amounts of construction in the
[2575.76s] west sales incentives on home deliveries
[2578.559s] as a percentage of
[2580.559s] Revenue the they&#39;re going to continue to
[2583.359s] produce and build they just don&#39;t know
[2584.8s] it yet uh it&#39;s going to be a race to the
[2586.839s] bottom for their margins and uh the
[2589.64s] building supply companies are going to
[2592.04s] make fortunes uh supplying the arms to
[2595.8s] the Battlers which are going to be the
[2599.48s] uh KB Homes the lenars ETC they&#39;ll make
[2602.319s] money don&#39;t get me wrong they&#39;re going
[2603.599s] to benefit from this as well but I want
[2605.64s] to be on the other side of it Japan
[2607.44s] inflation slows but the uptrend backs
[2609.52s] the case for raid hikes we&#39;ve said this
[2611.8s] over and
[2612.839s] over as a matter of fact we posted on
[2619.28s] Twitter um it&#39;s kind of funny yesterday
[2623.68s] they were all saying
[2629.2s] that oh the Tariff the markets down
[2631.8s] because of the tariffs and if you
[2633.64s] actually looked at the stock market it
[2636.319s] was kind of funny I had to post
[2639.16s] this and I don&#39;t like commenting
[2641.92s] day-to-day must be about the auto
[2644.079s] tariffs
[2645.319s] meanwhile the only stocks that were down
[2647.68s] were the mag 7 everything else in the
[2649.599s] market was up and and every single
[2652.48s] journalist uh on TV was saying it was
[2655.319s] the auto tariffs this is all Trump&#39;s
[2656.92s] fault and these were the stocks that
[2658.119s] were down what was going on the Japanese
[2662.24s] 10-year jgb yield was going to 20y year
[2666.839s] high high and what we&#39;ve talked about
[2669.16s] regularly for the last 6 months is to
[2671.52s] watch the unwind of the carry trade as
[2674.839s] the cost-free money starts to have a
[2677.24s] cost uh all the leverage that was
[2679.559s] embedded in the carry trade you
[2682.92s] you shorting Yen get free currency to
[2686.44s] then put into the most crowded trades
[2687.96s] which is mag 7 is unwinding and that is
[2691.24s] the day but here&#39;s year to date what&#39;s
[2693.839s] down only the mag s so like people keep
[2696.119s] asking me when&#39;s this going to stop I
[2697.2s] was like when&#39;s what going to stop we&#39;re
[2698.4s] up I mean this has been an unbelievable
[2701.079s] year so uh and and this is where most
[2703.96s] people are stuck the passive indexers
[2706.319s] are getting slammed because they&#39;re
[2707.88s] overweight in all these names that have
[2709.52s] been hit the hardest and they don&#39;t
[2711.2s] realize has nothing to do with tariffs
[2712.88s] has nothing to do with customer
[2713.96s] sentiment has to do with the unwind of
[2715.64s] Leverage that was embedded in the carry
[2717.44s] trade so as the Japanese inflation uh
[2719.839s] continues to pick up uh they will have
[2722.44s] to raise carry trade on wines all that
[2724.4s] hot money comes out of the hottest uh
[2726.52s] most crowd trades and you see more of
[2728.4s] this I think we&#39;re probably through
[2730.68s] another phase of this and these are
[2732.359s] going to get a bounce but uh every day
[2735.4s] when you see the market down just go
[2736.64s] look at uh 10year jgbs and that&#39;ll tell
[2739.16s] you the answer and all the commentators
[2741.599s] can you
[2744.48s] know blame policies that are unrelated
[2748.319s] to the stocks that are actually down
[2750.96s] Jack ma backed an TOS a touts AI
[2753.76s] breakthrough using Chinese Chips Alibaba
[2756.559s] stock
[2758.599s] oh we&#39;re okay here we
[2760.559s] go we got so much to cover I thought
[2762.8s] this was going to be an easy one today
[2764.0s] ladies and gentlemen we got a lot to
[2765.52s] cover here uh so this is kind
[2771.72s] of what&#39;s happening with
[2776.4s] cars smaller cars and smaller houses are
[2779.96s] going to be the name of the game for the
[2781.2s] next five years which is going to lead
[2783.2s] to massive volumes which is going to
[2784.8s] help Cooper standard which is a OEM
[2787.839s] supplier and um the building suppliers
[2791.119s] which are OEM suppliers I guess I guess
[2794.04s] lenar and KB and toll are considered
[2796.44s] oems in the housing business uh so what
[2798.96s] you&#39;re seeing is some of the mid the
[2801.079s] compact SUVs are going up subc compact
[2803.64s] the compact cars midsize trucks uh and
[2806.559s] everything going
[2807.76s] down fixed housing affordability index
[2810.88s] housing has not
[2812.28s] been this unaffordable since 20062 7 so
[2817.64s] how does that got res resolved uh last
[2820.079s] time it was through deleveraging and
[2822.48s] helocs coming due and a big crash this
[2825.44s] time it&#39;s going to be more and more
[2827.76s] options becoming available and once you
[2830.44s] have a massive supply of
[2832.599s] options um prices come down and you&#39;re
[2835.079s] going to see the same thing for labor as
[2837.48s] well I ran an ad for a personal
[2840.2s] assistant I I can&#39;t even tell you I need
[2843.68s] an assistant to go through all the
[2845.319s] applications I got for an assistant I
[2847.119s] mean you can&#39;t make this stuff up um
[2850.92s] it&#39;s staggering now so the the shift is
[2854.079s] so so what I&#39;m saying is wage inflation
[2856.44s] is com coming down which we all know uh
[2859.48s] why because there&#39;s a greater supply of
[2861.359s] labor than demand for labor right now
[2864.079s] and the same is going to happen as the
[2865.839s] supply picks up on Federal Land and in
[2868.319s] cities through the coercion tactics that
[2870.599s] I discussed uh and this will finish now
[2873.319s] National home prices change I am a
[2875.52s] master of patterns and I can tell you
[2878.44s] this pattern is pretty obvious ladies
[2880.64s] and gentlemen here is the national home
[2884.8s] price changes and just for
[2888.04s] Simplicity let&#39;s
[2892.72s] use real versus nominal
[2896.64s] prices and what you can see is the first
[2900.44s] part of the 20th century it just went
[2903.24s] back and forth pretty regularly
[2907.2s] that was before the 30-year mortgage by
[2908.839s] the way uh then
[2913.0s] the 18s to the 30s same thing uh then
[2917.839s] post World War
[2919.16s] II this is when the game got interesting
[2922.119s] so you&#39;d have 3 to five years of growth
[2926.52s] followed by 3 to five years of
[2928.28s] contraction 3 to five years of growth
[2929.92s] three to five years of contraction three
[2932.079s] to you know and more back and forth
[2935.079s] every three to five years growth
[2937.24s] contraction you had massive contraction
[2939.64s] people forget uh in real terms from 1989
[2942.88s] to 1996 that was the last Orange County
[2945.44s] housing crisis which was caused by the
[2948.359s] Japanese hot flows coming out after the
[2950.4s] China Market peaked so uh that&#39;s kind of
[2954.0s] an interesting
[2955.319s] parallel
[2957.04s] 97 through 2004 and then 2006 to 2011
[2963.24s] contraction then expansion basically
[2966.04s] since
[2967.48s] 2012 straight up till now that&#39;s one of
[2970.839s] the longest runs post World War II it
[2973.52s] actually is barring 8 97 to 2006 was a
[2978.559s] pretty long run 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 N9 here we
[2983.599s] have 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 then you had
[2988.119s] one year negative in 2022 last two years
[2991.0s] have been flat so these type of this is
[2994.119s] an extreme is what I&#39;m trying to telling
[2995.92s] you and then what the case that I was
[2997.48s] making was what how could you be
[3001.599s] generally constructive on the economy
[3003.28s] even though I see International stocks
[3004.92s] out pering domestic but I&#39;m still
[3006.599s] constructive on the economy because of
[3008.16s] the baby boom demographic Etc else uh
[3010.88s] and yet think housing prices are going
[3012.839s] to compress in certain areas or in
[3015.799s] Aggregate and I think you know there are
[3019.24s] similar examples in the early 90s you
[3022.079s] had you know booms in new technologies
[3025.96s] and and the and General stock market but
[3028.319s] you really had some housing and banking
[3030.88s] crises from just overheating through
[3033.119s] this period of 83 to 88 uh that needed
[3036.319s] to
[3037.72s] consolidate uh and uh and I think that&#39;s
[3040.28s] probably a pretty interesting par uh
[3043.0s] parallel to consider home prices versus
[3046.04s] inflation here&#39;s home price appreciation
[3048.72s] has dramatically exceeded inflation this
[3051.119s] runs in Cycles it under performed in the
[3054.76s] 30s and 40s outperformed in the 60s and
[3058.72s] has outperformed uh last few years this
[3061.52s] will converge and I think for some of
[3063.64s] the reasons that I&#39;m talking about real
[3065.16s] home price appreciation adjusted for
[3067.799s] inflation uh going all the way to 2024
[3070.52s] so you can see this has been a really
[3071.92s] aggressive move uh not none seen like
[3075.4s] this since the 202 2006
[3078.76s] Peak
[3082.359s] um this is and this is only showing to
[3085.319s] 2022 uh I you know it&#39;s funny I look at
[3088.16s] Tik Tok and I see all these Trends in
[3089.96s] 2022 you literally couldn&#39;t get to your
[3092.52s] feed every single person
[3095.599s] was every schmock was making a fortune
[3098.28s] in real estate and selling courses on
[3100.76s] how to make money in real estate etc etc
[3103.2s] etc and
[3105.839s] um that&#39;s what you see in in extreme so
[3109.799s] uh us median housing payment as a
[3111.559s] percentage of median income again
[3114.96s] highest since 2006
[3117.2s] again not calling for that type of Crash
[3119.88s] but I think the early 90s is a really
[3122.16s] really good parallel in terms of housing
[3124.119s] prices uh declining and disruption in
[3127.68s] the housing market price-wise not supply
[3131.2s] wise uh while the economy and the stock
[3133.76s] market does well and international
[3136.119s] stocks do extremely well uh United
[3138.64s] States 57% affordability Gap income
[3141.799s] needed to buy versus actual so this is
[3143.96s] all from Charlie
[3145.4s] Bello uh you can see some of these major
[3147.96s] cities starting to come down
[3151.079s] Tampa or grow at slower Paces I think
[3153.799s] you&#39;re going to see more of those hit
[3154.92s] the list uh increase over the last five
[3157.92s] years average hourly earnings have grown
[3160.559s] 25% us home prices have grown 53% these
[3163.68s] will converge i a mean reversion guy us
[3166.839s] home price growth by
[3170.96s] decade
[3174.92s] uh so I mean this is mindboggling so
[3178.76s] real
[3180.079s] annualized the highest decade was 40
[3183.92s] through
[3184.76s] 49 followed by 2010 to 2019 and 2020 to
[3189.88s] 2024 is double the highest basically at
[3192.559s] 4.6 the average for the last
[3196.48s] 133 years has been half a percent per
[3200.28s] year
[3202.119s] real uh part of the reason for that is
[3204.799s] the American homes have doubled in size
[3208.76s] so uh this is another theme I think
[3211.16s] we&#39;re going to be going to massive
[3213.72s] increase in volume of cars and houses a
[3217.04s] massive reduction in size in both cars
[3219.839s] and houses because we&#39;re meeting the
[3221.44s] needs of the people who need it which is
[3223.28s] our people starting families uh not
[3225.68s] people in their you know mid to late 40s
[3228.44s] early 50s who want to upgrade to the big
[3230.76s] house to you know be the biggest on the
[3233.119s] Block uh Etc so uh that&#39;ll be the next
[3235.96s] phase
[3237.359s] moving
[3241.92s] along all bare markets start with a
[3244.4s] correction but not all Corrections turn
[3246.04s] into a bear I think that is the case
[3247.76s] this time that&#39;s Ryan Dietrich stuff
[3249.4s] over at
[3250.44s] Carson uh investor allocation equities
[3253.52s] at an all-time high uh that&#39;s why you
[3256.839s] had to have some give back here in the
[3258.88s] first
[3259.72s] quarter um and continued under
[3262.72s] performance for mag 7 even if they
[3264.24s] technically Bounce from here which they
[3265.64s] probably will Market funds now at 10
[3268.559s] trillion so there is a lot of dry powder
[3271.68s] ready to be deployed I think a lot of
[3274.44s] that&#39;s going to start to be allocated uh
[3276.079s] by the financial advisors into
[3277.799s] Internationals after Internationals had
[3280.0s] a big move that&#39;ll be the next phase uh
[3283.119s] here is long short uh funds the
[3286.28s] percentage short they always sell at the
[3288.28s] bottom in the hole they were record
[3290.04s] sellers at at the exact bottom in
[3292.359s] February uh now they&#39;re going to have to
[3294.319s] chase up in coming months biggest
[3296.48s] foreign selling of US Stocks since March
[3298.799s] of 2023 so again selling in the
[3302.88s] hole
[3305.28s] um prices this is from Manheim and Cox
[3308.48s] prices of cars ATP is coming down this
[3312.119s] is in line with our thesis uh Let them
[3314.68s] fight the war lower prices increase
[3316.96s] incentives increase volume their margins
[3319.24s] will collapse uh our our volumes and
[3322.839s] margins will improve because we have
[3326.44s] economies of scale through the operating
[3328.119s] leverage of the business relationship
[3331.119s] between valuation and forward
[3334.2s] returns uh equities trade near smallest
[3336.92s] risk premium since 2002 lot of parallels
[3340.16s] to 2002 what
[3341.88s] outperformed uh International small cap
[3345.039s] value we&#39;re starting to see that small
[3347.359s] cap has lagged if you&#39;re if you don&#39;t
[3348.92s] have enough small cap Now&#39;s the Time in
[3350.839s] our opinion we&#39;ve raised our Euro area
[3353.839s] GDP forecast by 1% opinion follows Trend
[3356.52s] Europe is outperformed so now all the
[3358.359s] strategists are catching
[3360.119s] up uh Market implied fed funds
[3366.72s] rate so
[3374.16s] anticipating 369 by the end of the
[3379.2s] year energy consolidating Market is
[3382.28s] approaching key Crossroads what do we
[3384.359s] have here
[3387.079s] okay one of the
[3388.68s] sharpest draw Downs whether you get a
[3392.119s] recession or not and the outcome I think
[3394.28s] this is Son&#39;s recession which means
[3396.359s] we&#39;re going to recover Into Summer uh
[3398.839s] next year will be a bit choppier which
[3400.319s] will create more opportunities we&#39;ll
[3401.599s] probably be
[3402.599s] harvesting I I would think we&#39;re going
[3404.52s] to probably be harvesting about a third
[3406.559s] of our positions by the end of this year
[3409.16s] uh or maybe first quarter next year
[3411.0s] raise a bunch of cash and then next year
[3412.88s] gets choppy a mid midterm year which and
[3415.599s] we&#39;ll be able to put a lot of that cash
[3417.319s] and we&#39;ll probably be able to start the
[3418.64s] year with some nice uh put spreads
[3420.799s] across different sectors and companies
[3422.92s] make some money on the downside and then
[3424.72s] redeploy for the next five years uh and
[3428.0s] uh and have an awesome time large deals
[3430.2s] announced since 2018 so um that&#39;s that
[3435.079s] that&#39;s been anemic that&#39;s going to come
[3436.44s] back quickly inflow into Chinese
[3438.24s] security Rises to record high opinion
[3441.039s] follows Trend growth impact of credit
[3444.039s] impulse in China just beginning ladies
[3446.76s] and gentlemen no one&#39;s been paying
[3447.96s] attention for the last three quarters
[3449.319s] we&#39;ve been pounding the
[3450.839s] table
[3454.839s] um upcoming upcycle in consumer credit
[3462.319s] growth lending standards for Consumer
[3464.64s] grow okay so lending standards for
[3466.44s] Consumer loans have been going down the
[3469.319s] other thing is there&#39;s a lot of equity
[3470.96s] in houses as rates come down people are
[3472.799s] going to use that as the piggy bank
[3474.2s] again like we saw almost 20 years ago
[3477.039s] that&#39;s going to be very um good for the
[3479.96s] general
[3483.48s] economy small C positioning everyone&#39;s
[3486.079s] underway this is it&#39;s it&#39;s been time to
[3488.64s] buy when newsletters sell so not only
[3491.039s] are the hedge funds selling in the whole
[3492.64s] the newsletters are all bearish that&#39;s
[3495.16s] usually what you see at bottoms this was
[3496.64s] the only failed signal in early 2022 so
[3500.079s] everyone&#39;s pulling out their 2022 charts
[3502.92s] why because of recency bias they look at
[3505.28s] the most recent experience that they&#39;ve
[3507.319s] all went through and the 10-year-old
[3508.839s] money managers uh think that&#39;s the only
[3511.119s] one so they&#39;re all looking for this to
[3512.799s] go a lot further I don&#39;t think they&#39;re
[3514.28s] going to be right in this case uh US
[3516.64s] dollar and equities rarely fall sharply
[3518.72s] in tandem for long
[3520.68s] stretches
[3523.0s] um S&amp;P US dollar Index last time it
[3527.319s] happened was
[3528.799s] 20202 again another parallel we&#39;ve
[3531.76s] always talked about 20012 2002 which was
[3534.599s] the time to position where International
[3537.28s] small cap value everything no one wants
[3540.76s] and now they&#39;re starting to want it
[3542.039s] after they&#39;re up a lot but the game is
[3543.839s] actually just
[3545.319s] beginning uh asset return
[3549.24s] expectations oh that&#39;s funny everyone
[3551.28s] expects Japan to have the highest
[3552.839s] returns I think the opposite is going to
[3554.24s] be
[3555.119s] true uh speculators turned short dollar
[3558.119s] first time since October so opinion is
[3560.24s] following Trend as the dollars weakened
[3562.16s] that can be the beginning of a very long
[3564.24s] weakening Cycle Plaza Accord style Mar
[3567.68s] Lago Accord style S&amp;P returns following
[3570.96s] large declines in US sentiment
[3573.839s] indicator uh we covered this you know
[3576.48s] six and 12 months out you&#39;re up double
[3578.359s] digits if there&#39;s no recession we
[3579.839s] believe that is going to be the case
[3581.48s] this year
[3588.61s] [Music]
[3596.64s] do boom was way more extreme I think
[3598.88s] this is kind of
[3600.0s] interesting here showing the parallel a
[3602.88s] lot of people use
[3604.44s] analogs
[3606.16s] um but we could be in the early 90s
[3609.079s] stage which was all which would also be
[3610.839s] very interesting so it&#39;s something to
[3612.2s] put it in perspective when everyone says
[3613.599s] we&#39;re going to crash I I think you&#39;re
[3614.88s] going to see those bounce now not the
[3617.079s] only game in town International starting
[3619.92s] to outperform Country composition of the
[3623.119s] msci all country World index we&#39;ve
[3625.64s] covered before uh us United States is
[3628.799s] 64% of the weight it&#39;s not 64% of the
[3632.0s] earnings power so expect these weights
[3634.079s] to start to of course they were taking
[3635.799s] down China exposure just as the earnings
[3637.72s] start to accelerate so this three just
[3640.839s] this reminds me a lot of um actually go
[3643.92s] back and listen to the podcast in 2020
[3646.839s] during covid I think the energy sector
[3650.76s] had gotten down to
[3652.92s] 2% of the waiting of the S&amp;P 500 down
[3656.28s] from like 10% and I said this is not
[3659.52s] sustainable um and and if you remember
[3662.92s] they were basically threatening pensions
[3665.319s] and money managers if you invested in
[3667.44s] energy uh you&#39;d be cancelled effectively
[3670.4s] and so no one would do it and I said
[3671.88s] look at the end of the day people want
[3673.119s] their lights on so it&#39;s a question how
[3675.039s] much pain they&#39;re going to take before
[3676.319s] they all flip and that&#39;s exactly what
[3678.319s] happened the same thing is going to
[3679.4s] happen with China now uh you&#39;ve
[3681.799s] dramatically underperformed this year if
[3683.559s] you had no International exposure uh if
[3686.4s] you were overweight International you
[3688.119s] are doing extremely well and smiling so
[3690.039s] wide you could eat a banana sideways uh
[3692.68s] so um uh so that&#39;s that and so expect
[3696.599s] these weights to go up this weight to
[3698.48s] come down policy uncertainty waiting on
[3701.72s] us
[3705.079s] exceptionalism okay again these are
[3708.039s] people looking at policy when they
[3709.559s] should be looking at the 10-year
[3712.799s] jgb S&amp;P performance has historically
[3715.359s] Reborn rebounded well following
[3718.96s] Corrections
[3722.2s] so this is from Capital markets
[3725.559s] actually shows greater returns than we
[3727.44s] were talking about but the key is 12
[3728.96s] months out double digit returns if no
[3732.4s] recession we are in that camp double
[3734.68s] digit returns off the low which could
[3736.359s] mean again what we had anticipated for
[3738.88s] the year high single digits overall year
[3741.68s] returns for the passive indexers in the
[3743.359s] S&amp;P 500 which means S&amp;P 500 under
[3746.0s] performs which means stock Pickers win
[3747.92s] the day uh who are good at it China
[3750.68s] consumption picks up at year start in
[3753.119s] line with
[3754.4s] thesis uh Euro USD reduct the
[3757.4s] significance of whatever it takes euro
[3759.599s] is starting to Rally no one&#39;s paying
[3761.079s] attention I also love the the bo the
[3763.48s] rally in Boeing that no one&#39;s paying
[3765.4s] attention to now that&#39;s pretty exciting
[3767.2s] to me I love when stocks start to rally
[3769.2s] and people aren&#39;t paying attention
[3770.96s] because they&#39;re so they got so
[3772.76s] pessimistic at the lows it reminds me
[3774.359s] when we were talking about GE at the
[3776.92s] lows uh and you couldn&#39;t give it
[3779.48s] away uh and that thing had a monster
[3782.359s] rally with no one paying attention
[3784.4s] China&#39;s fiscal stimulus in 2025 will be
[3786.64s] the largest outside the pandemic that&#39;s
[3789.799s] big news no one&#39;s paying attention to it
[3792.16s] this would be the most pension and
[3795.359s] Target date F okay this would be the
[3797.24s] most pension and Target date fund buying
[3800.48s] since March of 2020 okay so they
[3803.279s] rebalance they get triggered on the
[3805.2s] basis of draw Downs all that money is
[3807.319s] flowing in over the next few weeks so
[3809.76s] pay attention to that Target date funds
[3812.039s] and for those of you who have already
[3813.599s] been approved
[3814.88s] congratulations uh who are already in
[3816.68s] and funded we&#39;re we&#39;re putting money to
[3818.319s] work and we&#39;ll put the rest to work next
[3819.72s] week as well uh and those of you who
[3822.359s] want to come in in this opening uh do
[3825.44s] get your inquiries in because it does
[3827.039s] take about a week to get all the
[3828.16s] paperwork done and approved and funded
[3830.76s] and we can start allocating so you can
[3832.48s] take advantage of these opportunities
[3834.039s] we&#39;re discussing um uh Chinese EVS are
[3837.4s] making inroads around the
[3840.839s] world here is oh this is from Seth
[3845.119s] golden this is an S&amp;P chart so we see
[3847.839s] this correction here and then a rally
[3849.64s] and then check back you know like a lot
[3851.68s] of stocks rally checkback here&#39;s the
[3853.44s] checkback that we&#39;re going through right
[3855.0s] now so this this looks pretty uh pretty
[3861.0s] regular conference board one-ear
[3863.96s] expectation of stock prices has
[3866.44s] collapsed biggest decline ever in 40
[3869.359s] years the other big declines were
[3873.88s] co
[3875.92s] uh covid
[3881.92s] lows 2002 so that&#39;s an interesting stat
[3885.799s] from fun
[3889.559s] Strat May soon lose its uh us may soon
[3893.319s] lose its Global stock market leadership
[3896.279s] Crown we&#39;ve been talking about that and
[3899.76s] preparing for a while it&#39;s not because
[3902.039s] us is going to lose their exceptionalism
[3903.76s] us it&#39;s going to do great I think what&#39;s
[3905.799s] going to happen is what happened under
[3907.16s] Trump 1.0 which is that the middle and
[3911.68s] lower class are going to improve more
[3914.52s] than the upper class under Trump uh
[3917.44s] second term so the stock market returns
[3920.039s] will be more subdued in the US they will
[3922.279s] dramatically outperform in
[3924.2s] international uh and they will
[3926.119s] dramatically outperform for stock
[3927.52s] Pickers buying those stocks that do well
[3929.72s] when Trump is in office and avoiding
[3931.559s] those stocks that have already done well
[3934.079s] in the rear viw
[3935.359s] mirror uh and we we do concur here&#39;s
[3938.799s] another situation here to looking at the
[3941.2s] trade weighted dollar Index I really
[3943.839s] like this chart because it talks about
[3945.48s] when the dollar weakens these different
[3947.76s] regimes regime one dollar weekend you
[3950.839s] had us uh you had International
[3952.48s] outperformance then the dollar
[3954.16s] strengthened in Reagan&#39;s first
[3957.44s] term weakened in the second term that
[3960.279s] was the plaza Accord Peak that we talked
[3962.24s] about then you had dramatic
[3963.96s] International equity
[3965.559s] outperformance and what they&#39;re talking
[3967.559s] about
[3968.92s] here uh you can
[3971.559s] see you know International equities
[3974.16s] during that period up
[3975.599s] 17% then you see regime five the dollar
[3978.599s] weaken from
[3980.079s] 20032 2003 to 2009 you had uh dramatic
[3986.359s] uh International outperformance 14%
[3989.2s] compounded per year versus 5% of us then
[3992.72s] you had the dollar strengthening follow
[3994.559s] following 2009 and it what they&#39;re
[3997.88s] talking about here is uh dollar now
[4001.0s] weakening and you&#39;re seeing the
[4002.72s] international outperform the US and
[4004.599s] these things go on for at least a
[4006.599s] handful of years um so more stuff we
[4010.119s] burden oursel with the facts let&#39;s see
[4013.64s] here okay from Sarah eyes and here&#39;s the
[4016.48s] chart on the global imbalance that the
[4018.4s] Trump Administration is trying to adjust
[4020.76s] us makes up 29% of global consumption
[4024.079s] but only 15% of global manufacturing
[4026.76s] China makes up 12% of global consumer
[4028.92s] spending and 32% of global manufacturing
[4032.599s] we have lost a m lot of manufacturing
[4034.319s] share to China well guess what China
[4037.039s] wants to increase their share of global
[4039.88s] consumer spending while we want to
[4041.68s] increase our share of global
[4043.079s] manufacturing so maybe there&#39;s a deal to
[4045.0s] be done there and it comes with a reset
[4047.839s] and a reval of the US dollar to make us
[4050.319s] more competitive globally they get what
[4052.799s] they want we get what we want and uh it
[4056.039s] that how&#39;s that for reciprocal uh so the
[4058.599s] meeting is imminent us durable goods
[4060.76s] orders uh motor vehicles and parts are
[4064.68s] up front loading ahead of tariffs boost
[4067.599s] us durable goods orders so a lot of
[4069.72s] front row uh loaded production should
[4072.359s] help Cooper standard in q1 which is
[4074.76s] pretty exciting
[4076.079s] and uh Jeff Edwards alluded to as much
[4078.559s] on the uh interview we did last week
[4082.16s] growth expectations us has peaked while
[4084.72s] the Euro area is too low according to
[4088.079s] mrb Partners here is the 10-year jgb you
[4092.52s] can see what&#39;s happening with these
[4093.64s] yields you can see why the current why
[4096.0s] the carry trade is
[4099.48s] unwinding Here Is Us sales for each OEM
[4102.52s] by origin of production
[4106.0s] so we&#39;ll see how this shakes
[4108.44s] out but as Jeff Edwards said on the
[4111.96s] earnings call the oems are going to have
[4114.52s] to take it the oems basically pushed all
[4117.159s] the part suppliers down to Mexico
[4119.0s] because they wanted to increase their
[4120.239s] margins so they&#39;re going to have to eat
[4123.48s] that if they want the supplies they need
[4125.0s] to build their cars which they&#39;re going
[4126.4s] to need because competition is coming
[4129.239s] and they don&#39;t want to lose more and
[4130.96s] more share so they&#39;re going to run
[4134.08s] incentives they&#39;re going to to run
[4135.88s] volumes in order to not to lose share
[4138.64s] which cannot be easily
[4140.719s] reversed uh magnificent 7 set for worst
[4143.799s] quarter since
[4145.52s] 2022 on no one&#39;s bingo card other than
[4148.759s] the loyal amazing listeners of hedge
[4151.199s] fund tips with Tom Hayes here is the GDP
[4154.839s] now estimate from the Atlanta fed
[4157.56s] actually coming
[4159.199s] in uh at Nega 1.7 there&#39;s a lot of
[4163.96s] inventory noise in this so I I think if
[4166.239s] you I don&#39;t know that you&#39;re going to
[4167.719s] get an actual negative print for q1 uh
[4170.6s] these are often wrong but even if you do
[4174.759s] you won&#39;t get two in a row because of
[4176.4s] the way the noise and the numbers here
[4179.04s] but it&#39;s something to keep an eye on for
[4181.239s] sure uh okay moving along

[4272.08s] to force them to offer incentives which
[4274.679s] is going to get more people buying cars
[4276.32s] which is going to get more people

[4300.199s] becomes profit Boon for us
[4302.96s] multinationals uh Intel stock could soar
[4306.199s] if this Nvidia rumor is true and here is
[4310.679s] the
[4311.639s] rumor the Intel 18a process node which
[4315.8s] features multiple Technical Innovations
[4318.76s] and should challenge market leader
[4324.44s] tsmc in terms of performance and
[4327.0s] efficiency is ready for production
[4331.28s] ladies and Gentlemen The Challenge now
[4333.92s] is to scale up and fill that capacity
[4336.239s] with new customer orders according to
[4338.159s] UBS analyst Timothy arcury Intel is
[4341.679s] closing in on scoring Nvidia as a
[4344.44s] Foundry cust customer while Intel has
[4346.92s] both Microsoft and Amazon on board as
[4349.719s] Intel 18a customers winning over the
[4352.44s] largest fablous chip designer by Revenue
[4354.6s] would be an enormous vote of confidence
[4356.96s] in Intel&#39;s Foundry business the rumor
[4359.199s] makes sense uh the two are compelling
[4362.04s] reasons why Nvidia may be keen on
[4363.48s] shifting some production away from tsmc
[4365.36s] to Intel first the company is struggling
[4367.04s] to provide enough gaming gpus to meet
[4369.159s] demand Nvidia recently launched its RTX
[4371.44s] 50 Series graphic cards but supply has
[4373.719s] been extremely tight leading to prices
[4375.6s] well above MSRP Nvidia makes a lot more
[4378.08s] money selling data center gpus aimed at
[4380.32s] AI workloads than it does from gaming
[4382.08s] gpus so it makes sense that AI chips
[4384.84s] would be the priority Nvidia only has so
[4386.84s] much manufacturing capacity at tsmc and
[4390.239s] the company would be leaving money on
[4391.92s] the table if it didn&#39;t go all out to
[4393.679s] meet soaring demand for AI
[4398.32s] accelerators if Nvidia were to shift
[4400.52s] gaming GPU production to Intel while
[4402.239s] leaving AI chip production at tsmc the
[4405.48s] company would likely have an easier time
[4406.88s] meeting demand for both products the
[4408.239s] longer it takes Nvidia to meet demand
[4410.32s] from Gamers the more likely it becomes
[4411.84s] that those Gamers give up and move over
[4413.4s] to gpus from AMD amd&#39;s latest RX 9000
[4417.28s] graphics cards are impressive and Nvidia
[4418.92s] may be losing market share thanks to a
[4420.8s] rough Supply situation so Nvidia Intel
[4424.239s] is the only game in town to solve their
[4426.12s] problem uh they can make them an offer
[4428.199s] they can&#39;t refuse

[4796.12s] is over now we&#39;re going to stick around
[4798.0s] for extra credit with the ask me
[4800.32s] anything questions from our audience and
[4803.0s] we&#39;ve got a bunch of good ones this week
[4805.36s] so let&#39;s get the party
[4807.28s] started and we&#39;ve
[4809.84s] got Henry
[4812.96s] Griffin uh the Wall Street Journal
[4815.28s] article on US economic growth
[4816.679s] transitioning from oil towards
[4817.92s] electricity is huge for
[4819.52s] Alamar this switch will create large
[4822.32s] investments in Grid scales and other
[4823.679s] forms of electric tainment distribution
[4825.679s] in which lithium and lithium ion
[4827.4s] batteries dominate lfg lfg baby uh also
[4832.08s] what rap do you listen to was listening
[4834.719s] to an old podcast and you mentioned how
[4836.8s] your jersey Roots instilled rap in you I
[4838.96s] don&#39;t remember that I don&#39;t listen to
[4840.4s] much rap I&#39;m a country guy uh you know I
[4844.04s] like a good rap song but you know Jay-Z
[4846.56s] was good in the day I mean look Kanye
[4848.719s] was amazing in the day until he became a
[4850.96s] anti-semite but um his music was really
[4854.36s] good so I&#39;ll leave it at that but uh you
[4858.28s] know kind of sad what&#39;s happened to him
[4861.04s] but anyway uh deep value investor hey
[4863.679s] Tom great podcast been following you
[4866.56s] since your 30 Minute Podcast and now
[4870.0s] they&#39;re over two hours great work I have
[4871.639s] a small cap I&#39;m watching vant
[4874.679s] technology ticker DSP
[4878.52s] undervalued double digit growth
[4880.36s] profitable cash flow thoughts on this
[4882.96s] and second question any concern with see
[4884.96s] single digit slow growth no they&#39;re in
[4887.159s] their trough they&#39;re generating huge
[4888.679s] amounts of cash if they continue to grow
[4890.639s] slow they&#39;ll just buy in a ton of the
[4892.4s] company uh but more likely than not
[4894.92s] you&#39;re seeing the new platforms having
[4896.8s] high growth rates they&#39;ll figure it out
[4899.08s] and um and until they figure it out
[4901.48s] they&#39;ll just give me bigger and bigger
[4903.36s] slices of the pie uh with no new money
[4906.159s] out of pocket by reducing the
[4909.04s] float so DSP
[4940.8s] yeah I mean if you&#39;ve listened for a
[4942.56s] while so it looks like their cash flow
[4943.8s] is starting to roll over
[4945.12s] over got to figure out if that&#39;s
[4947.159s] temporary or or permanent or cyclical
[4950.32s] thing uh let&#39;s see what they do chances
[4952.679s] are this is a company I would avoid
[4954.32s] because I can have no Edge on whether
[4956.08s] they&#39;re okay provide vant AI a suite of
[4959.56s] AI intelligence products uh blah blah
[4963.639s] blah digital and personal
[4967.04s] identified video level data to power PL
[4969.96s] so yeah so just tell me why they have a
[4973.28s] moat I mean so so that&#39;s why Buffett
[4976.239s] generally avoids software companies uh
[4979.0s] it&#39;s why we do it&#39;s because the barriers
[4982.04s] to
[4982.72s] [Music]
[4983.8s] entry number one it&#39;s tough to really
[4986.199s] get one that stands out and number two
[4988.639s] once you do uh the barrier to entries
[4991.52s] can be pretty low uh and you can be
[4993.96s] disintermediated pretty
[4995.8s] quickly uh so I I don&#39;t have an edge
[4999.4s] here but if you have an edge as to
[5002.88s] why there Stu is the best in class and
[5005.8s] no one can ever compete with them then
[5007.8s] you can start to take a look at it and
[5009.679s] try to understand why their cash flow is
[5013.0s] starting to decelerate so abruptly and
[5016.159s] for for us that&#39;s that&#39;s just a pass
[5018.159s] that goes in the too hard box doesn&#39;t
[5020.04s] mean the price won&#39;t go up but it&#39;s not
[5021.56s] for us Dustin
[5025.159s] Dickerson uh now that more information
[5027.28s] has come to light about CPS and future
[5029.48s] prospects would you ever think about
[5030.719s] increasing your initial underwriting
[5032.08s] intrinsic value price or is this
[5034.0s] something you determine in the beginning
[5035.6s] and don&#39;t change in order to stay
[5037.04s] grounded just curious across the board
[5038.719s] with all Investments you make do you
[5039.84s] ever reconsider intrinsic value and
[5041.8s] therefore exit price uh when additional
[5044.32s] positive information shows up yeah I&#39;ve
[5046.199s] said many times that you know we can
[5047.88s] adjust based on new information up or
[5051.04s] down but on balance I&#39;m probably taking
[5053.52s] some off at where I intended which I
[5056.04s] didn&#39;t publicly disclose uh at all so
[5060.84s] um
[5062.44s] uh all I can say is it&#39;s it&#39;s a ton
[5065.08s] higher from here so and probably a
[5068.159s] meaningful amount of time from here uh
[5071.48s] but um this one&#39;s going to be a f
[5074.84s] fantastic one for us so uh no I I
[5077.96s] generally don&#39;t give credit for the Whi
[5079.36s] cream there&#39;s a lot of new whip cream
[5080.6s] that&#39;s come to light but it the story
[5082.4s] was so attractive even without that you
[5084.48s] know underwriting it on Icees
[5086.48s] underwriting it on zero to the rest of
[5088.639s] the rest of the world uh underwriting it
[5091.36s] on the cost base they had in place in
[5093.84s] 2020 2 2 not the revised cost base so
[5096.76s] yeah but we don&#39;t get in or out of our
[5099.08s] positions all at once so we could have
[5103.52s] tranches of our investment that stay on
[5106.32s] for two times what we thought we would
[5108.56s] get out and maybe 80 of our position uh
[5111.52s] 80% of our initial position could be out
[5113.8s] at or where we determined we would get
[5115.76s] out before we got in and then the 20 we
[5117.76s] just hold as a flyer because it&#39;s up you
[5119.88s] know
[5121.0s] 710x uh and it&#39;s just a free ride at
[5123.44s] that point and even if it falls in half
[5125.56s] we take it off and it&#39;s all free money
[5127.84s] uh and we don&#39;t worry about it but um
[5130.36s] that&#39;s
[5131.96s] that uh don
[5137.8s] Gaffney question is given the average
[5140.119s] age of the vehicle 14 years old record
[5142.159s] high increase uh population 40% what is
[5145.159s] the amount of vehicles that have been
[5146.199s] taken off the road as in how many have
[5148.36s] been sent to the junkyard and sent to be
[5150.719s] scrapped because anecdotally I&#39;ll look
[5152.679s] from I I don&#39;t do any anecdotally
[5155.6s] period okay but here&#39;s what he says
[5157.719s] anecdotally I look from my office
[5160.04s] Schoolcraft College and I can see the
[5161.679s] CPS headquarters at the tra in the
[5163.92s] traffic and don&#39;t see any old rusted out
[5166.56s] junkers with bad Mufflers could it be
[5168.92s] that the car that are being built today
[5171.32s] are better than in the past have a
[5172.92s] longer exporation maybe 20 or more years
[5174.92s] if so production would be lower yeah
[5177.239s] look they&#39;ll run 20 years the question
[5179.4s] is do you want to be in a 20-year-old
[5181.56s] clunker I mean these you know in Cuba
[5184.56s] they run them for 80 years but the point
[5186.639s] is is when they become affordable and
[5190.4s] it&#39;s like gener okay the areas where
[5193.199s] they have the highest growth are the
[5195.0s] areas that they have the highest
[5196.239s] concentration so it&#39;s Keeping Up With
[5198.639s] the Jones it&#39;s when the power goes out
[5200.84s] and you&#39;re the only schmuck sitting in
[5202.159s] the dark with no internet and no ref and
[5204.28s] all your food going rotten and all your
[5206.08s] neighbors are up and running and you
[5207.36s] hear the beautiful hum of their gener
[5209.0s] generator in the neighborhood uh it&#39;s
[5210.96s] the last time that&#39;s happening to you
[5212.6s] and you call them up and you plunk down
[5213.92s] your 25,000 or you finance it as rates
[5216.28s] come down and the game is on so the
[5218.719s] areas that have double digit penetration
[5220.76s] like Michigan and Texas where they have
[5222.6s] a lot of grid failures genra is growing
[5225.0s] at the fastest Pace uh and and it just
[5228.0s] Builds on itself and the areas once you
[5230.76s] start to see the affordability the
[5233.0s] average total price come down which is
[5234.719s] starting to happen and the incentives
[5236.4s] going up which has been happening um
[5240.159s] your neighbors are going to be getting
[5241.32s] new cars and you don&#39;t want to be the
[5242.52s] only schmuck on your block with a 20-
[5244.52s] car uh and uh and then the whole game
[5247.6s] resets and we see this every handful of
[5249.8s] years and you don&#39;t have to look back
[5251.6s] much further than
[5253.08s] 2017 and you don&#39;t have to look back
[5255.08s] much further than that than 2006 2007
[5258.32s] every Schmo had a new car and that same
[5261.159s] thing is going to happen right now so um
[5265.0s] that&#39;s that and yes the cars are built
[5267.44s] better uh but you know they just wear
[5270.0s] out even if they run the style the
[5273.52s] everything just starts to get tired uh
[5275.96s] Tom if you&#39;re ever in the neighborhood
[5277.08s] and visiting CPS I&#39;d happily pick you up
[5278.719s] at the airport uh if I don&#39;t win a hat
[5281.48s] maybe someday I&#39;ll be a client and on
[5283.04s] your Christmas lift VF Court being an
[5285.92s] Irish a green pair of shoes would come
[5287.639s] in handy Don Gaff love it Don uh there
[5290.88s] you go I&#39;ll buy you a Guinness all right
[5293.719s] Rob Crest have you continued buying the
[5297.0s] dip in Advance Auto Parts at these
[5299.36s] prices
[5301.04s] um I think a better way to frame that is
[5304.28s] if new as new clients money is being put
[5307.32s] to work is Advanced Auto Parts in the
[5309.96s] mix and the answer is yes Bill Sherman
[5313.04s] what do you think about Novo at these
[5318.84s] levels my gracious how right were you
[5321.44s] not to jump in during the weight loss
[5323.52s] craze
[5325.36s] uh I don&#39;t even have to look at it Bill
[5328.96s] you&#39;re now jumping on a broken growth
[5333.36s] stock with a ton of competition which is
[5335.4s] what I said would happen so yeah it&#39;s
[5338.0s] down
[5338.84s] 50% uh I think it&#39;s going to take two to
[5342.32s] three years if it&#39;s going to bottom here
[5344.239s] in the 70s to 50s it&#39;s going to take two
[5346.199s] to three years my guess is it&#39;s two to
[5349.6s] three years more and it bottoms 10 to 20
[5352.159s] points lower uh and I&#39;m willing to be
[5354.44s] wrong and miss it so that&#39;s what we call
[5356.96s] a broken growth stock all the people
[5358.92s] that couldn&#39;t get enough at 147 are
[5361.719s] totally screwed and uh rebuilding those
[5366.8s] institutional holders that got smashed
[5369.44s] uh is going to take a long time that is
[5371.639s] a broken growth stock ladies and
[5373.32s] gentlemen Heather Christensen AMA take a
[5376.48s] look at CNM great Tailwinds for the
[5378.199s] industry looks to be priced
[5381.32s] well okay
[5383.96s] CNM core and Maine so again this is one
[5387.679s] of these broken stocks that with recency
[5391.199s] buys you say well it was 55 now it&#39;s 45
[5393.639s] what a bargain but where were you at $20
[5397.28s] you know I mean that&#39;s what that&#39;s the
[5399.4s] discipline you have to start to get I
[5402.56s] have these cell-side guys sending me
[5404.679s] these stupid ideas all the time after
[5406.76s] they&#39;re up 3x and it&#39;s like where the
[5408.44s] hell were you when no one wanted it I&#39;m
[5410.04s] not interested Corin main distributes
[5412.48s] Water waste water storm drainage
[5414.08s] protects related
[5416.0s] service underground water infrastructure
[5432.52s] CNM cash flow is eroding price hasn&#39;t
[5435.56s] eroded commensurate with
[5437.88s] the deterioration in cash flow so tell
[5440.56s] me how they&#39;re going to turn this back
[5441.84s] around and I&#39;ll take another look but
[5444.239s] for now it just looks like it&#39;s you
[5446.28s] missed it Tim D thoughts onf trading at
[5451.56s] seven times
[5452.92s] earnings stop asking two questions per
[5455.679s] thing it&#39;s selfish because it crowds out
[5457.84s] other
[5458.679s] people
[5460.88s] um and
[5468.88s] F I don&#39;t I just don&#39;t like these I&#39;ve
[5472.32s] never ANF is like the
[5476.8s] biggest this thing has historically been
[5479.8s] a piece of garbage okay so maybe they
[5482.88s] had some hot thing during 2022 to 2024
[5485.92s] it&#39;s going to go back to being garbage
[5487.88s] uh this is a the definition of a broken
[5490.0s] growth stock I want nothing to do with
[5491.52s] this thing could trade at one times
[5493.6s] earnings uh I have no interest in that
[5496.719s] UPS I&#39;m interested in but it&#39;s not been
[5499.92s] beaten down enough yet for me to get
[5502.199s] super interested so uh it&#39;s probably at
[5505.52s] a decent area I mean let&#39;s take a look
[5508.199s] at the financials but there&#39;s not enough
[5510.239s] margin of safety for me to get excited
[5512.04s] yet probably bounces for technical trade
[5514.84s] shortterm but longterm to get my double
[5517.36s] and triple I just don&#39;t see it happening
[5519.119s] so for me it&#39;s a pass it&#39;s probably okay
[5522.08s] if you&#39;re thinking in terms of 10 years
[5523.679s] if you&#39;re thinking in terms of three
[5524.92s] years it&#39;s a coin flip Griffin
[5528.199s] Brown going off my question last week
[5530.52s] when do you look through a company&#39;s
[5531.679s] annual report when you look through a
[5533.48s] company&#39;s annual report do you read
[5534.679s] every word of every section or are there
[5536.36s] certain sections you tend to focus on
[5537.88s] more than others uh I assume this
[5540.0s] changes from company to company and
[5541.44s] Industry to industry but in general what
[5542.84s] are the Highlight obviously the
[5544.08s] financials come first but beyond that
[5546.04s] yes I do read every single especially
[5548.159s] the footnotes that&#39;s where all the
[5549.639s] that&#39;s where they try to hide all the
[5551.0s] stuff that&#39;s the most important so uh
[5553.28s] yeah you got to do the work Lee Foster I
[5556.239s] know you&#39;re a single name guy but I was
[5557.88s] wondering if you ever invested in
[5560.48s] National ETFs I&#39;m
[5562.719s] reading contrarian National
[5567.6s] ETFs I&#39;m looking at Vietnam and Brazil
[5571.08s] specifically wondering your thoughts
[5572.8s] well Brazil has a problem problem
[5577.719s] that we don&#39;t tend to do that um Brazil
[5581.36s] has a leadership problem it&#39;s run by a
[5583.719s] socialist kind of funny coming from a
[5585.92s] guy who&#39;s got his biggest position with
[5587.639s] a communist country but you know if you
[5590.36s] can&#39;t take a joke
[5595.88s] um I think you&#39;re going to be right with
[5598.91s] [Music]
[5600.44s] that and I think you&#39;re probably going
[5602.239s] to be right with Vietnam as well
[5605.28s] um but you know that&#39;s like if you&#39;re
[5609.639s] super right with Vietnam you make like
[5611.32s] 70
[5613.28s] 80% which is not enough for me to
[5616.36s] initiate a position like if I if I don&#39;t
[5618.32s] have at least a double I I don&#39;t even
[5620.719s] allocate Capital uh Brazil you really
[5624.639s] need that guy
[5627.119s] out hopefully sooner rather than later
[5629.679s] to get the boom but I think all
[5630.96s] International is going to do well so I
[5632.199s] don&#39;t think those would hurt you VIN
[5634.48s] sentore would love to hear your opinion
[5637.32s] on heyer
[5646.719s] Yale uh probably not yet my
[5654.76s] man what do these guys
[5662.4s] do sir Services a line of trucks
[5665.32s] attachments aftermarket
[5667.8s] parts
[5678.84s] yeah the only thing worse than car parts
[5681.36s] is truck
[5682.15s] [Music]
[5683.84s] parts I would say
[5688.639s] uh maybe ready but I think it&#39;s I don&#39;t
[5692.8s] know I honestly with this thing I would
[5695.32s] be looking at i&#39; I&#39;d probably just set
[5697.28s] an alert at like $35 and if it hit I&#39;d
[5699.92s] start doing work on it because it&#39;s just
[5703.32s] such a shitty business that it just has
[5705.08s] to be left for dead and then I have to
[5706.56s] say okay they&#39;re not going bankrupt let
[5708.0s] me see how they compete competitively
[5710.96s] it&#39;s just there&#39;s not enough margin of
[5712.239s] safety for for this quality of a
[5713.8s] business I mean at $5 with Cooper
[5715.84s] standard if they didn&#39;t go bankrupt I
[5717.6s] knew I had a triple uh and then from
[5720.04s] there as they&#39;ve improved the business I
[5721.679s] know it&#39;s going to be a lot more
[5723.679s] probably from $5 you know 15 25 times so
[5728.84s] uh Matt Mitchell uh thoughts on T at
[5732.28s] these levels high quality business
[5734.36s] two-thirds of the firm&#39;s assets held in
[5735.92s] retirement accounts stick your asset
[5737.639s] piece I don&#39;t like the business
[5744.8s] [Music]
[5745.96s] um I think you&#39;re I think
[5749.76s] you&#39;re right but I don&#39;t like this
[5753.159s] business
[5756.4s] enough to get
[5766.48s] involved I mean this is just a hope that
[5769.36s] they buy in all the stock and you own a
[5771.239s] bigger portion of the company it&#39;s
[5772.6s] probably going to be okay Matt but it&#39;s
[5774.639s] it&#39;s just it&#39;s not a great business uh
[5777.92s] Matt Jack
[5780.36s] trtnik from who knows where ah here we
[5783.88s] go longtime listener big fan of your
[5785.679s] work writing in from Slovenia I&#39;m sure

[5803.199s] podcast my Friday mornings wouldn&#39;t
[5805.679s] would wouldn&#39;t be the same without it uh
[5808.88s] thank you for that since I started
[5810.0s] following you back in 2023 my entire
[5811.6s] view on investing has shifted currently
[5813.679s] I&#39;m managing my portfolios myself as I
[5815.679s] truly enjoy do doing
[5822.719s] that but at the same time I&#39;ve been
[5824.84s] seriously considering having my money
[5826.239s] managed professionally in the future
[5827.8s] summer my wife and family will be
[5829.239s] traveling to Cali all right whatever
[5831.04s] separate note uh curious about your take
[5834.239s] on Pitney bows this is a garbage
[5836.719s] business uh that&#39;s going to be a low
[5839.0s] price stock for a long
[5841.28s] time um and you missed it I mean if
[5844.08s] you&#39;re playing a turnaround you you you
[5845.88s] missed it um hard P hard
[5849.199s] pass uh thanks for all you
[5852.239s] do well thank you from slovania very
[5854.88s] excited when you&#39;re in California look
[5856.44s] me up and um we&#39;ll get together Jacob
[5861.599s] saxo uh last
[5864.0s] week&#39;s podcast you mentioned about Bank
[5866.639s] supplementary leverage ratio Scott
[5868.28s] bessent how significant of a removal we
[5870.44s] told you last week Jacob it&#39;s 30 basis
[5872.44s] points on the 10year tra
[5874.719s] uh Drew
[5876.159s] Robinson what are your thoughts on lft
[5879.44s] uh there&#39;s some activist involvement
[5880.88s] it&#39;s probably okay but I don&#39;t like the
[5883.56s] business y
[5887.52s] ft
[5896.76s] um next
[5899.159s] Lucas what price would you consider Nike
[5901.56s] undervalued in this range
[5904.04s] but it&#39;s going to take a longer time
[5905.44s] than most people think so the question
[5906.84s] is what&#39;s your irr five years out
[5909.96s] OA thank you so much for your product it
[5912.199s] can express how valuable your insights
[5913.639s] manag okay you&#39;re welcome thank you Oz
[5916.679s] I&#39;d love to hear your thoughts on
[5918.2s] [Music]
[5922.56s] Puma I don&#39;t know no one wears Pumas in
[5924.96s] the US other than uh
[5935.48s] that guy who uh that golfer his name
[5939.719s] slips my
[5941.28s] mind
[5942.64s] [Music]
[5943.84s] uh Puma I don&#39;t know Puma is
[5948.76s] like that that must be like a European
[5951.28s] thing no one wears that in America
[5968.639s] let me see the balance sheet I think
[5969.84s] you&#39;re probably going to be right on
[5971.36s] this
[5982.719s] one I mean I&#39;d rather buy Nike and just
[5985.36s] wait five years for it to work than and
[5987.4s] buy this thing so they&#39;ve been eroding
[5991.76s] cash let&#39;s see how much debt do they
[5994.32s] have well Deb&#39;s not bad
[6005.599s] either yeah they generate a lot of cash
[6007.96s] flow I I think you&#39;re probably okay here
[6011.159s] um certainly good good enough for a
[6013.44s] bounce that&#39;s for
[6015.0s] sure
[6020.92s] um thanks for your amazing content
[6026.04s] I&#39;m an asset manager in Columbia and
[6031.88s] Brazil reap
[6036.92s] vehicles in
[6047.119s] decreasing
[6048.96s] Patria P
[6051.52s] ax yeah you really just have to know the
[6053.96s] underlying assets and I&#39;m going to have
[6055.88s] no Edge on the buildings or whatever
[6058.32s] they own in Brazil so therefore it&#39;s a
[6061.679s] pass for
[6063.52s] me um but if you have comfort with the
[6067.56s] buildings and with the financials uh
[6070.599s] yeah it&#39;s another way to play it for
[6072.639s] sure
[6075.56s] um yeah you&#39;re probably right uh but
[6078.8s] it&#39;s not for
[6079.84s] me uh I never take company and Country
[6082.76s] risks
[6083.84s] so you know if I was going to play like
[6086.44s] you know with China I took the best most
[6088.639s] secure company when no one wanted China
[6091.239s] uh with oil and during covid I took the
[6094.08s] best company during the Lowe&#39;s which was
[6096.4s] Exxon uh I took Wells Fargo at $25 when
[6099.679s] you couldn&#39;t give away a bank during
[6101.119s] covid so uh for me to play the country
[6105.08s] and Leadership risk in Brazil with a you
[6108.36s] know a Reit that I have no Edge on is
[6111.88s] not the way I would play it um
[6114.239s] personally but if you&#39;re a regional
[6115.84s] manager I mean it generally looks okay
[6118.88s] if you understand the underlying assets
[6121.199s] perfectly Anna
[6128.96s] gutowski no they want to come on the
[6131.44s] podcast we don&#39;t accept guests unless
[6134.32s] they are rock
