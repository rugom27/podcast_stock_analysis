down just 3/4 of 8% uh Thomas Hayes joins me now good morning according to you Thomas hey you know if you got the you know intestinal fortitude you say it's time to be a buyer not a seller that's right Ashley as Warren Buffett famous famously said when it rains gold pull out a bucket not a thimble there are a lot of great companies on sale uh we're putting in a bottom here and a bottom is messy you can go down and retest the lows uh but there have been 21 Corrections 10% moves or more downward since 1980 and in the 14 where there were no recession which we believe this will be part of 6 months later the Market's up 9% on average we're seeing sentiment flushed out a aii sentiment survey this morning there's only 21% of retail investors are bullish 58% are bearish but on the smart money side what you're seeing is Corporate insiders are buying back stock to the largest extent since the lows in 2022 so the the concerns is a slowing economy prices remaining higher um you know the dreaded stagflation uh concern and with tariffs it's just uncertainty at this point I mean those fears are they Justified well certainly they're Justified but that that's what creates dislocation in prices they don't give away doubles for free you have to buy it when everyone is selling in the hole and this is one of those opportunities you saw record Put buying by retail investors last week they were buying insurance after the house had burned down you saw records selling in the hole by hedge funds these are contrarian indicators if you buy during these times and you buy selectively and you buy high quality and you look 12 months out later you've done really really well and we're back\n\n### MEDIA_APPEARANCE_RECAP\nthat&#39;s right Ashley as Warren Buffett famous famously said when it

you look 12 months out later you&#39;ve done really really well and we&#39;re back uh then we&#39;re going to start off with some\n### QUOTES_OF_THE_WEEK\n\n### QUOTES_OF_THE_WEEK\n\n### QUOTES_OF_THE_WEEK\nfrom Charlie Munger one of my uh the great people that I look up to he says a lot of success in life and business comes from knowing what you want to avoid I.E early death a bad marriage uh Etc and uh and this is easy you know a lot of people always say to me gosh you look so young I was like yeah I don&#39;t do drugs and I don&#39;t drink much like what else do you want to know so you know things you want to avoid early death uh Robert arnard in investing what is comfortable is rarely profitable and um I think there&#39;s a corollary to that which goes uh what starts uncomfortable comes very uncom becomes very comfortable over time as we&#39;ve seen in many of the names Through The Years here on hedge fund tips with Tom Hayes uh and then David teer in order to get that Comfort what do you need to do the key is to wait sometimes the hardest thing to do is to do nothing and uh that&#39;s key and that&#39;s why having a good hobby like golf comes in handy uh when you&#39;re tempted by the devil of activity you want to get into to inactivity when you&#39;ve bought right and you&#39;ve bought quality at good prices you just wait and play the time Arbitrage game and that is a unique advantage in the market\n### TECHNICAL_CHARTS\nrelative performance of sectors I think this has been a unique year that caught a lot of people by surprise but no one on the hedge fund tips with Tom Hayes Money Train was taken by surprise because uh you were ready the last shall be first and they were you can see here uh reach outperformed the S&amp;P 500 year to date uh Chinese stocks outperform the S&amp;P dramatically year to date by the way this is a secular turn um uh you know similar to what we saw 2016 to 2018 then you know 2019 to 2021 and here we&#39;ve put in even bigger base the the longer the base the higher the space and uh this is just getting going then we&#39;ve got uh bonds have outperformed the S&amp;P year to date uh that took a lot of people by surprise no one here uh biotech we love this setup here putting in the bottom just like we saw here in 2020 you had a bottom kind of a double bottom type of her or reverse Head and Shoulders however you want to look at it I think biotech is poised to Rocket we&#39;re going to look at some of that then uh materials outperform the S&amp;P all the stuff that we talked about if you remember from our last Shelby first you can find all the old posts on hedge fund tips with Tom Hayes just go down to commentary you can see of our weekly articles going back five some OD years or you can just go to video cast here under categories and see every single video cast uh or podcast if you like to listen uh communication Services looks like it&#39;s stalling out relative to the S&amp;P uh energy okay you remember go back to the podcast in 2020 when oil was negative we were buying like crazy here we had more pain and then they just just took off like crazy I remember buying Exxon at $33 when oil was negative and pounding the table on the podcast went a little against us before it went off took absolutely took off and then we were laying off in 2022 and everyone was getting excited about it and they basically done nothing since um so now it looks like it wants to take another leg higher energy is again we continue to pay attention to we continue to have exposure through Comstock which has been a home run uh probably be a three bagger within within a few months from where we bought uh already two plus and uh just beginning with that one financials relative to the S&amp;P has had the huge run we laid off a lot we still have some Regional exposure I think on the next major rally we&#39;re going to take that off uh believe it or not so we were able to take off the banks in the summer uh after a huge run in city and Bank of America after the March remember the March mini banking crisis we were hand over fist uh and we took off uh over the summer so let&#39;s see what happens with that um but we&#39;re waiting for the next big rally to get rid of regionals uh xli at a very nice profit xli industrial starting to outperform relative to so we look at this to find sectors we want to drill down on to find Opportunities and the key with the opportunities is I think what most people is they&#39;re they like a a normal business person&#39;s mindset is you get paid for activity Massive Action equals massive results and I think a lot of people just get distracted by the new shiny object uh and rather than holding to great quality businesses unless something has changed in our thesis if we have a new idea it has to be so much better than an existing idea in the portfolio to take something out that has hasn&#39;t yet reached full intrinsic value the the the we determined prior to entering the position in order to replace it so um uh but anyway Tech has underperformed relative to the S&amp;P no surprise to us surprise to many uh Staples have outperformed we got a they got a little defensive um you know we like a little exposure there through the baers of the world through the horels of the world but nothing crazy and um same thing with utilities this is all going to be a function of rates continuing to go lower we&#39;ll talk about that which we have Healthcare same story a defensive starting to outperform Baxter I think biotech is going to pick up into that very quickly discretionary has absolutely rolled over with consumer sentiment relative to the S&amp;P there&#39;s going to be some opportunity to buy some stuff there and that&#39;s how we kind of an overview then we look at bullish percentage these are the percentage of stocks in the sector on a point and figure Buy Signal we don&#39;t use point and figure but this is a useful indicator to see different sectors we have found communication Services already started to rebound uh NASDAQ composit starting to rebound there&#39;s opportunity there like I said in previous media interviews uh Tech and mag 7 are going to bounce I do think they&#39;re going to underperform for the year maybe trade back up to the top of the range which most people are going to say see they&#39;re the best blah blah blah and then they&#39;ll stall out again uh consumer discretionary I think there&#39;s a lot to do here the VF Corps of the world Nike if we didn&#39;t own VF Corp but Nike has a little bit bigger in other words Nike is where VF Corp was a year and a half ago when we got involved with Brack and Daryl um I think it&#39;s going to take a little longer than people expect but I think Nike will be back over time uh just not yet and not as soon as most people think uh energy again uh starting to move move gold miners don&#39;t really care healthc care opportunity there you know I keep looking at the fisers of the world and uh continue to pass we have exposure through biotech and through Baxter um bullish industry Industrials this is just getting started the generx the uh boeings well yeah boeings the um Stanley Black and Deckers this is all going to be the way with the construction trade which we&#39;re going to spend some time on and it&#39;s funny I&#39;ve had in my mind two conflicting thoughts and that&#39;s very common uh as you get experienced in the business and the the the one thought is that the economy is going to continue to do really really well for the next five years because of the Baby Boomers because of certain policies because of a lot of different things um uh we can expect material strength at least for another 5 years before we get a lost decade probably 10 years 8 to 10 years but um at the same time I&#39;m in Orange County and I&#39;m I&#39;m thinking about real estate here and I continue to say this this just feels bubbleisha reset and I&#39;m saying to myself well how can this possibly be when we have hous housing shortage of 3.8 million units how are prices ever going to come down like part of me is okay the Chinese own 11% of the housing stock now that everything&#39;s going back up in China they&#39;re going to get fomo they&#39;re going to stop pushing their money out of uh China and the marginal bid the marginal buyer in Orange County and some of these cities around the country is going to evaporate and when that evaporates you hit an air pocket and you get a reset and the economy can still be strong even if that resets and that that&#39;s part of the thesis we&#39;re going to get to some policy things that may yield a booming economy and either consolidating home prices meaning they can just run sideways for many years and not go up uh or actually correcting home prices but not correcting in a way where you wind up with a 2008 once in a 100y year event correcting in a way like it got ahead of itself because of Co and some un natural government intervention that needs to be flushed through uh and the overall economy can continue to flourish so that&#39;s where we see the industrial opportunity uh Tech again these are going to bounce there&#39;s a lot to do there we&#39;ve got a bunch of exposure uh and then materials uh this one I think there&#39;s immense opportunities we&#39;ve got albam Maro I think that&#39;s going to be a monster for us uh relatively new position and then um nysse is starting to bounce these are kind of more the industrial names real estate bounced pulling back a little bit you&#39;re going to see the CCIS of the world in the reach continue to Rally uh bullish percent SPX I think this is I think you know I&#39;ve said it on the media for the last week or so and Market probably bottomed a couple weeks ago tried to go back and retest didn&#39;t quite do it I I think we put the bottom in and uh I&#39;m super glad for the new people that have come in uh now that their money&#39;s getting to work right away because I think we&#39;re going to be straight up to the summer as I had said and yes I know we have uh April 2nd looming so we&#39;ll keep some dry powder to put money to work if some crazy thing happens but if you look at most of the stocks that are going to be affected by it um they&#39;ve kind of you know this is like this is going to be the biggest known surprise in humanity I think it&#39;s going to be the sell the rumor by the news scenario all over again and most people are think they have some Edge like tariffs are coming like who the hell has not heard about that like turn on your local news Fox 5 you don&#39;t need to turn on Fox Business for that uh all you need to do is have a heartbeat and you know that that&#39;s coming which means if everyone knows it it&#39;s probably priced and if you look at most of the industrial stocks uh and Auto Part suppliers and everything else uh you know a lot of that&#39;s priced so when it actually happens or if it happens you know less than expected uh there&#39;s only upside downsides kind of priced in and that that&#39;s our our based case and you know you get the Bears that&#39;ll all say oh the Market&#39;s being too conservative maybe in the short term maybe you get some short-term volatility but uh that&#39;s that&#39;s not how we think about it the businesses that we buy uh and I always say you can&#39;t invest over things you have no control so the businesses that we buy the demand for the items and the competitive Moes that they have are going to be unchanged irrespective of how much of that gets passed through the consumer there&#39;s t\n\n bullish percent SPX I think this is I think you know I&#39;ve said it on the media for the last week or so and Market probably bottomed a couple weeks ago tried to go back and retest didn&#39;t quite do it I I think we put the bottom in and uh I&#39;m super glad for the new people that have

the businesses that we buy uh and I always say you can&#39;t invest over things you have no control so the businesses that we buy the demand for the items and the competitive Moes that they have are going to be unchanged irrespective of how much of that gets passed through the consumer there is  a fixed amount of demand that&#39;s not going to go away now could it hurt at the margins for a few weeks or or a couple of quarters sure but it&#39;s not going to change share because their competitors are all going to have the same climate that they have to operate in so therefore it&#39;s a short-term reset for a long-term reward if you get the worst case scenario and if you don&#39;t then it&#39;s just massive money made to the upside overnight and no one gets let in so uh you know take your risk like modest down downside volatility uh because of a a knee-jerk reaction in the short term versus massive upside if it&#39;s slightly worse than expected or it&#39;s known and then the weakest hands that haven&#39;t been turning on the local news get\n\n### MISCELLANEOUS\nhere is a fixed amount of demand that's not going to go away now could it hurt at the margins for a few weeks or

on the local news get\n\n### MEDIA_APPEARANCE_RECAP\nfinally\n\nhere are a bunch of charts that we've uh some names that we've discussed over time and what's so exciting and beautiful as we go through these is there you know the the window has closed there's no question that this once in a 100e opportunity to put money to work is getting narrower and narrower as a lot of our names have taken off but there are still such beautiful generational and when I say generational some of these are once in 20 years but a lot of them are once in 10 or 15 years uh and that's a lot of time to get you know to be able to buy it at such amazing prices and get doubles triples quadruples over the next handful of years and that that Windows pretty much closing so um I want to congratulate all the uh people who've come in the last just week and a half Alone um and um and many of you have already been approved by interactive brokers I don't know what they're doing over there but they've got their act together and you know these applications are getting approved in uh you know day or two versus a week which is exciting and funded so we're going to get get money to work now get money to work after uh April 2nd and and rock and roll so but you can see I mean yes Baba a lot of people miss that I mean it's going a lot higher there's no question about it but you know we're now up 120% off the lows so um you know hopefully for those of you who don't have enough exposure if you're lucky you'll get you know High 120s to get back in maybe mid10 but don't hold your breath this thing the train has left the station we told you that would be happening that's already happened all these other names that you guys are pessimistic on they're next so if you thought this was a surprise which you shouldn't think it's a damn surprise because we spent two years telling you what was going to happen uh just wait till you see the next batch and what's going to take place and it's so funny I had some new clients like I've been listening to you for over a year I thought I knew how you invested I had no idea I'm looking at the portfolio he's like I would have never figured this out I was like well you know what else do you want me to tell you uh you know that that the you're a client now it's a different game so uh anyway so Baxter um you know again this is a defensive stock they take a you know year year and a half two years to base every cycle here we are and then it just goes straight up and it recaptures new highs why because it has a moat the IV business it's the switching costs are high their pumps are fantastic and they got rid of the lowquality business the low growth business called the kidney business and you can't give it away and that's what happens right before they go to the room now today on Cooper standard everyone's nervous about the tariffs I I pray to God we get a 15 handle because I really didn't want to put new clients in this thing at 17 bucks even though it's going a lot higher over the next few years uh so I pray to God we get some serious fear in the next week and I can get a 154 handle on this and do one final absolute load the boat but I don't think we're going to get it so we'll see uh Disney uh Disney I like here I I would put new money to work but um uh you know this is going to take a few years and it's going to work its way back to New highs and Beyond uh PayPal uh or gen rather so look you bought in the 90s wrote up to to 195 that's great this is the beginning this is the next phase this is what it does so if you look back to 2016 same exact thing you know you get this Panic selloff Fountain double check then you rally up everyone gets excited gets in at 195 you smoke them out you drop 33% and then you just start to move up to the next major major move so 3 years from now this thing's going to be a ton higher uh a lot of people probably got knocked out here I would put new money to work here for sure um and probably will Intel lip bhan we're going to cover some of that today this is going to be fantastic that's all I can tell you uh small caps final breather before the move higher um Banks I think we're going to get another rally here we'll probably lay off on the next rally PayPal same exact story you come out of these lows you get the check backs scare everyone out and then you take your next leg higher this time just like we saw with Baba by the way this this is this is standard Fair ladies and gentlemen because you just get the dumb money that come in right after you have the massive rallies then you take them all out and then you take the next huge leg up and then they'll buy up here at 160 take it back to 140 before you let them off the bus and then you go straight to 200 plus and that's the way the game works so um all right where were we PayPal this is a home run uh this this I'm putting new money to work for sure uh Stanley Black and&amp; Decker this is the most leveraged play on the housing recovery which I'm going to tell you why is coming to a theater near you very quickly I love this play um bonds double head and shoulders bottom here started to Rally beginning of the year we'll consolid a little bit they're going to continue to rally for the foreseeable future which helps all of our thesis whether it be at home builders and uh we talked about last year with last week with what Scott Besson is doing on the um Capital charges for banks removing some of those restrictions uh is going to lower the 10 year by another 30 basis points takes it on three takes 10e mortgages under six and you have not seen anything like a housing boom of what you're going to see over the next five years in terms of Supply so what how do we want to play that again do we want you know just like the pent up demand in cars do we want to be the one fighting the war where these car companies oems are going to be fighting against each other for share and discounting and offering incentives no we want to be the Arms Dealer like Cooper standard selling a ceiling as they as they lower prices and volumes go through the roof with a 13 and a half year uh average car on the road let them kill each other overprice we're going to sell them the the weapons which is which is the ceiling and the fluid transfer systems and we're we get paid on volumes it's going to be the same with the housing the home builders um are going to be producing tons and tons and tons of houses with all the new land available to build and uh the ones that are going to benefit are going to be the um uh homeb Building Supplies Distributors and those type of businesses like qxo with Brad Jacobs which we own and uh had had an opportunity to be able to participate in the early days that is one that you just buy and you wake up in eight years and you've got a seven to 10 bagger I mean that's how Brad Jacob rolls and uh the guy's a winner he knows how how to do a creative Acquisitions he knows how to add technology value ad to drive profits synergies and then he knows how to play the multiple Arbitrage games so yes he paid up for Beacon but you can you can be sure tucks and um um Acquisitions in a fragmented Market he's going to be able to buy at lower multiples and get the public market multiple um Arbitrage and it's going to be fantastic so excited for that VF Corp same exact story every single cycle rallies off the lows checks back takes everyone off the bus and then goes back on to new highs same thing here rallies makes everyone doubt it and then back to to new highs so it takes a little while to consolidate and Brad uh Brack and Daryl's going to take this thing back up to new highs and it's going to be you know a handful of years but off of a 13 $15 basis you're going to wind up with a seven bagger so I mean you know uh or you can just switch to the next shiny object and keep missing great opportunities uh biotech same thing every cycle you get this bottoming another fake out like we had last year then you rally up fake them one last time and then you another parabolic move so 130 140 would not surprise me in a reasonable amount of time okay chart of the week let's see where we are I thought this was going to be a short one because we had them by the way if you missed the amazing interview with Jeff Edwards CEO of Cooper standard last week be sure to check in either at our YouTube station just go to YouTube and enter hedge fund tips uh or uh hedge fund tips with Tom Hayes podcast episode 283 was phenomenal so let's talk about CTA uh positioning in US equities they got this low in the hole in 2022 they got this low in uh the covid lows when we were pounding the table to buy uh in Fall of 2023 all of these were great buying opportunities they're down at these levels now that's the reason we've been talking this is very interesting the road from Plaza the Plaza to Mar Lago the dollars approaching valuations hit in 1985 this is super important because uh this was Reagan's second term first year of second term just like it's Trump first year of second term uh dollar was weak they wanted they excuse me the dollar was record strong they wanted it weak and they met at the plaza it was named after the Plaza Hotel in New York City um which uh I think oddly enough I don't know if Trump owned it at that time that's kind of funny I think he owned it at that time uh anyway they came to an agreement between France West Germany Japan United Kingdom the United States to depreciate the US dollar in relationship to the Frank the Deutsch Mark the Yen and the British pound sterling by intervening in currency markets the dollar depreciated significantly from the time of the agreement until it was replaced by the Lou Ray Accord the Lou Accord in 1987 uh some commentators believe the plaza Accord continued to contributed to let me highlight this so you guys don't miss it contributed to the Japanese asset price bubble of the late 1980s ladies and gentlemen I'm going to step out on a limb here and say if there there are Rumblings about a Mara Lago Accord okay and t\n\n### MEDIA_APPEARANCE_RECAP\nlast week be sure to check in either at our YouTube station just go to YouTube and enter hedge fund tips uh or uh hedge fund tips with Tom Hayes podcast episode 283 was phenomenal so let&#39;s talk about CTA uh

Japanese asset price bubble of the late 1980s ladies and gentlemen I&#39;m going to step out on a limb here and say if there there are Rumblings about a Mara Lago Accord\n\nTrump has shown his hand that he wants a weaker dollar to give us an advantage with trade with paying off the debt with everything else that comes down to it if they were to negotiate a maral Lago Accord and depreciate the US dollar this would not contribute to a Japanese asset price bubble over the next four years this would contribute to a Chinese asset price bubble of the late 20 22s and I think that all of the pieces of the puzzle are coming together that this would not surprise me at all and I think this could be the fuel for the last parabolic move in China before they come to two three lost decades like the Japanese have due to demographic miscalculations that cannot be Unwound in the next decade plus so um and and and that would certainly cause the marginal bid in using US housing certainly in areas like Orange County to evaporate um and cause a major air pocket because if everything is going up around them they&#39;re not going to pay the friction uh and the risk of getting additional money out of the country they&#39;ll keep what they got out of China here uh because it&#39;s so hard to get it out but when you&#39;ve got more opportunity domestically and you got friction to get money out to to a place where the opportunities are not as good in the short term uh all you have to do is look at people&#39;s incentives and you know how they&#39;re going to act but um this is setting up very very similarly so keep an eye on the mara logo Accord moving forward jackma backed ant TOS touts AI breakthrough using Chinese Chips uh jackma used ant group jackma backed ant Group Company used chinese-made semiconductors to develop techniques for AI training models that would cut cost by 20% according to people familiar with the matter an used domestic chips including from affiliate Alibaba

forcing them to do business away from us uh and to learn how to do it themselves and they&#39;ve done it a lot sooner than we could have imagined if we we had kept them dependent on our chips uh they would be a decade behind as we look out but they are it is what it is CH uh Trump Aly Ally visits Beijing to pave way for X Summit so Trump and X are going to meet uh Intel CEO lip Buu tan completes $25 million stock by and here&#39;s the beauty of it ladies and gentlemen he paid $25 million for 1 million 43,46 shares on March 26 the price per share was $23.96 most of you have basy well better than the CEO of the company and you probably still have a very limited window to lock that in talk about aligned interest with a partner super exciting news Bank of America mortgage applications jumped 80% in q1 says the executive which is kind of interesting when you think about consumer sentiment was in the gutter Etc but you had a few weeks there where mortgage rates came down wait till they drop below six and this thing goes all in this is what I&#39;m talking about Trump moves forward with plans to use federal land to build affordable housing so Nationwide the federal government owns about 1 million square miles of land or about 27% of the country&#39;s total land area the new initiative will focus on the roughly 500 million Acres managed by the department of the interior which oversees National Park Parks and Wildlife refugees so you will get not only a beautiful 1800 squ foot home by KB Homes but an endangered elk in your backyard free of charge all right uh joking not joking so um so here&#39;s the deal this announ this announcement follows a recent report from realor.com which found that the industry has a housing Supply gap of at least $3.8 million units at the current pace of construction it would take more than seven years for Supply to catch up with demand um in the joint oped in the Wall Street Journal bergam and Turner said that the inter agency task force would work to reduce red tape associated with building on Federal Land and cut through the bureaucracy to Spur new Housing Development so what they&#39;re basically saying is that we&#39;ve had so much trouble in municipalities because people don&#39;t want crowding in their own backyard that we&#39;re going to just open up this land and build there&#39;s another aspect because they really struggle in the suburbs more than they do in the cities people don&#39;t move into the cities because they want to be by themselves they move into the city because they want proximity they want people around them Etc there&#39;s another thing that they&#39;re going to do with some of the tax credits in the cities to force the local uh politicians to to cut the red tape so I think you&#39;re going to get greater density in the cities and I think you&#39;re going to get greater density in the excerts uh where these Federal lands are where they can build massive amounts of houses now that a lot of people can work hybrid and and that type of thing and businesses will pop up just like they did in the suburbs uh in the 80s so uh we will open up portions of federal land for large large scale housing construction these zones will be ultra low tax ultra low regulation we are going to open our country to building homes inexpensively young people uh and other people can buy homes so two things are going to happen one you get the Chinese marginal buyer in the expensive areas evaporating because there&#39;s more opportunities in the short term in China to make more money in a shorter amount of time number two you&#39;re going to get the opening of the federal land 500 million acres to build these 3.8 million um and number three is we&#39;re going to get to in just a minute is basically here the City Journal piece from Christ Christopher Elmendorf and Alex arich and he said uh Trump ordered uh his departments on day one to deliver emergency price relief including action to lower the cost of housing and expand the housing Supply so what they&#39;re proposing is how housing is too expensive because its development is overregulation yet the regulations that drive up housing costs Arcane local zoning and building codes are not the kinds that Congressional Republicans are best to fight however many of the local codes protect Suburban single family home neighborhoods and a residential ideal that Trump has pointedly defended in a new paper we suggest one way out of this dilemma Target big expensive cities for housing growth while letting States decide for themselves what to do about the suburbs specifically we propose to reallocate Federal affordable housing tax credits A roughly $15 billion subsidy away from the nation&#39;s biggest most expensive cities unless they adopt a basic set of pro housing reform specifically to retain their eligibility for the federal affordable housing subsidy these cities would have to allow development of apartment and condo buildings along major corridors and in commercial areas cap development fees at $10,000 per new unit roughly the national average wave provide waivers from Price controls that render a project infeasible and approve projects that conform to applicable standards ministerially that is without discre discretionary reviews and Associated conditions of approval that may change a Project&#39;s design or increase its cost Congress should also task a federal agency with developing criteria for measuring City&#39;s housing performance such as housing stock growth relative to potential growth given prices and partial characteristics persistently poor performers should lose their eligibility for federal subsidies regardless of whether they have opted into the Federal Pro housing reforms our proposal is Bud budget neutral and State neutral this is important if a city like New York chooses not to relax its regulations the tax credits it foregoes would flow to affordable housing projects elsewhere in the state the new agency uh the new policy would put significant pressure on Big City governments to develop pro- housing reforms since Progressive City Council Members won&#39;t want to be seen forfeiting affordable housing funds the suburbs would be unaffected however as the new policy would apply only to big expensive cities so you basically bracket it the suburbs where everyone&#39;s nimi not in my backyard let them let them have what they want you&#39;ve got 500 million of federal lands that&#39;s going to be all in massive production and then now you force the cities into it which um really really could be effective and that&#39;s how I think we get a renewed affordability and housing in a Rel relatively short period of time so again we&#39;ve got to find some ways to play the arms dealers and I think the number one company to start with and I and and I&#39;ve got a lot more on on my radar is going to be qxo okay which we have a nice position from lower levels and we are going to uh hopefully be able to use any opportunities to get more and set and forget for a long time because he&#39;s he&#39;s going to be in the game in a major way and an effective way so these are the Articles you can see here this shows where all the federal land is yellow is Bureau of Land Management it&#39;s mostly in the west um Bureau of Indian Affairs Department of Defense fish and wildlife Service Forest Service etc etc etc so this is where you&#39;re going to see huge amounts of construction in the west sales incentives on home deliveries as a percentage of Revenue the they&#39;re going to continue to produce and build they just don&#39;t know it yet uh it&#39;s going to be a race to the bottom for their margins and uh the building supply companies are going to make fortunes uh supplying the arms to the Battlers which are going to be the uh KB Homes the lenars ETC they&#39;ll make money don&#39;t get me wrong they&#39;re going to benefit from this as well but I want to be on the other side of it Japan inflation slows but the uptrend backs the case for raid hikes we&#39;ve said this over and over as a matter of fact we posted on Twitter um it&#39;s kind of funny yesterday they were all saying that oh the Tariff the markets down because of the tariffs and if you actually looked at the stock market it was kind of funny I had to post this and I don&#39;t like commenting day-to-day must be about the auto tariffs meanwhile the only stocks that were down were the mag 7 everything else in the market was up and and every single journalist uh on TV was saying it was the auto tariffs this is all Trump&#39;s fault and these were the stocks that were down what was going on the Japanese 10-year jgb yield was going to 20y year high high and what we&#39;ve talked about regularly for the last 6 months is to watch the unwind of the carry trade as the cost-free money starts to have a cost uh all the leverage that was embedded in the carry trade you you shorting Yen get free currency to then put into the most crowded trades which is mag 7 is unwinding and that is the day but here&#39;s year to date what&#39;s down only the mag s so like people keep asking me when&#39;s this going to stop I was like when&#39;s what going to stop we&#39;re up I mean this has been an unbelievable year so uh and and this is where most people are stuck the passive indexers are getting slammed because they&#39;re overweight in all these names that have been hit the hardest and they don&#39;t realize has nothing to do with tariffs has nothing to do with customer sentiment has to do with the unwind of Leverage that was embedded in the carry trade so as the Japanese inflation uh continues to pick up uh they will have to raise carry trade on wines all that hot money comes out of the hottest uh most crowd trades and you see more of this I think we&#39;re probably through another phase of this and these are going to get a bounce but uh every day when you see the market down just go look at uh 10year jgbs and that&#39;ll tell you the answer and all the commentators can you know blame policies that are unrelated to the stocks that are actually down Jack ma backed an TOS a touts AI breakthrough using Chinese Chips Alibaba stock oh we&#39;re okay here we go we got so much to cover I thought this was going to be an easy one today ladies and gentlemen we got a lot to cover here uh so this is kind of what&#39;s happening with cars smaller cars and smaller houses are going to be the name of the game for the next five years which is going to lead to massive volumes which is going to help Cooper standard which is a OEM supplier and um the building suppliers which are OEM suppliers I guess I guess lenar and KB and toll are considered oems in the housing business uh so what you&#39;re seeing is some of the mid the compact SUVs are going up subc compact the compact cars midsize trucks uh and everything going down fixed housing affordability index housing has not been this unaffordable since 20062 7 so how does that got res resolved uh last time it was through deleveraging and helocs coming due and a big crash this time it&#39;s going to be more and more options becoming available and once you have a massive supply of options um prices come down and you&#39;re going to see the same thing for labor as well I ran an ad for a personal assistant I I can&#39;t even tell you I need an assistant to go through all the applications I got for an assistant I mean you can&#39;t make this stuff up um it&#39;s staggering now so the the shift is so so what I&#39;m saying is wage inflation is com coming down which we all know uh why because there&#39;s a greater supply of labor than demand for labor right now and the same is going to happen as the supply picks up on Federal Land and in cities through the coercion tactics that I discussed uh and this will finish now National home prices change I am a master of patterns and I can tell you this pattern is pretty obvious ladies and gentlemen\n\nar jgbs and that&#39;ll tell you the answer and all the commentators can you know blame policies that are unrelated to the stocks

same is going to happen as the supply picks up on Federal Land and in cities through the coercion tactics that I discussed uh and this will finish now National home prices change I am a master of patterns and I can tell you this pattern is pretty obvious ladies and gentlemen\nhere is  the national home price changes and just for Simplicity let&#39;s use real versus nominal prices and what you can see is the first part of the 20th century it just went back and forth pretty regularly that was before the 30-year mortgage by the way uh then the 18s to the 30s same thing uh then post World War II this is when the game got interesting so you&#39;d have 3 to five years of growth followed by 3 to five years of contraction 3 to five years of growth three to five years of contraction three to you know and more back and forth every three to five years growth contraction you had massive contraction people forget uh in real terms from 1989 to 1996 that was the last Orange County housing crisis which was caused by the Japanese hot flows coming out after the China Market peaked so uh that&#39;s kind of an interesting parallel 97 through 2004 and then 2006 to 2011 contraction then expansion basically since 2012 straight up till now that&#39;s one of the longest runs post World War II it actually is barring 8 97 to 2006 was a pretty long run 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 N9 here we have 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 then you had one year negative in 2022 last two years have been flat so these type of this is an extreme is what I&#39;m trying to telling you and then what the case that I was making was what how could you be generally constructive on the economy even though I see International stocks out pering domestic but I&#39;m still constructive on the economy because of the baby boom demographic Etc else uh and yet think housing prices are going to compress in certain areas or in Aggregate and I think you know there are similar examples in the early 90s you had you know booms in new technologies and and the and General stock market but you really had some housing and banking crises from just overheating through this period of 83 to 88 uh that needed to consolidate uh and uh and I think that&#39;s probably a pretty interesting par uh parallel to consider home prices versus inflation here&#39;s home price appreciation has dramatically exceeded inflation this runs in Cycles it under performed in the 30s and 40s outperformed in the 60s and has outperformed uh last few years this will converge and I think for some of the reasons that I&#39;m talking about real home price appreciation adjusted for inflation uh going all the way to 2024 so you can see this has been a really aggressive move uh not none seen like this since the 202 2006 Peak um this is and this is only showing to 2022 uh I you know it&#39;s funny I look at Tik Tok and I see all these Trends in 2022 you literally couldn&#39;t get to your feed every single person was every schmock was making a fortune in real estate and selling courses on how to make money in real estate etc etc etc and um that&#39;s what you see in in extreme so uh us median housing payment as a percentage of median income again highest since 2006 again not calling for that type of Crash but I think the early 90s is a really really good parallel in terms of housing prices uh declining and disruption in the housing market price-wise not supply wise uh while the economy and the stock market does well and international stocks do extremely well uh United States 57% affordability Gap income needed to buy versus actual so this is all from Charlie Bello uh you can see some of these major cities starting to come down Tampa or grow at slower Paces I think you&#39;re going to see more of those hit the list uh increase over the last five years average hourly earnings have grown 25% us home prices have grown 53% these will converge i a mean reversion guy us home price growth by decade uh so I mean this is mindboggling so real annualized the highest decade was 40 through 49 followed by 2010 to 2019 and 2020 to 2024 is double the highest basically at 4.6 the average for the last 133 years has been half a percent per year real uh part of the reason for that is the American homes have doubled in size so uh this is another theme I think we&#39;re going to be going to massive increase in volume of cars and houses a massive reduction in size in both cars and houses because we&#39;re meeting the needs of the people who need it which is our people starting families uh not people in their you know mid to late 40s early 50s who want to upgrade to the big house to you know be the biggest on the Block uh Etc so uh that&#39;ll be the next phase\n\n### MACRO_DATA_SLIDES\nnot none seen like this since the 202 2006 Peak um this is and this is only showing to 2022 uh I you know it&#39;s funny I look at Tik Tok and I see all these Trends in 2022 you literally couldn&#39;t get to your feed every single person was every schmock was making a fortune in real estate and selling courses on how to make money in real estate etc etc etc and um that&#39;s what you see in in extreme so uh us median housing payment as a

short they always sell at the bottom in the hole they were record sellers at at the exact bottom in February uh now they&#39;re going to have to chase up in coming months biggest foreign selling of US

increase incentives increase volume their margins will collapse uh our our volumes and margins will improve because we have economies of scale through the operating leverage of the business relationship between valuation and forward returns uh equities trade near smallest risk premium since 2002 lot of parallels to 2002 what outperformed uh International small cap value we&#39;re starting to see that small cap has lagged if you&#39;re if you don&#39;t have enough small cap Now&#39;s the Time in our opinion we&#39;ve raised our Euro area GDP forecast by 1% opinion follows Trend Europe is outperformed so now all the strategists are catching up uh Market implied fed funds rate so anticipating 369 by the end of the year energy consolidating Market is approaching key Crossroads what do we have here okay one of the sharpest draw Downs whether you get a recession or not and the outcome I think this is Son&#39;s recession which means we&#39;re going to recover Into Summer uh next year will be a bit choppier which will create more opportunities we&#39;ll probably be harvesting I I would think we&#39;re going to probably be harvesting about a third of our positions by the end of this year uh or maybe first quarter next year raise a bunch of cash and then next year gets choppy a mid midterm year which and we&#39;ll be able to put a lot of that cash and we&#39;ll probably be able to start the year with some nice uh put spreads across different sectors and companies make some money on the downside and then redeploy for the next five years uh and uh and have an awesome time large deals announced since 2018 so um that&#39;s that that&#39;s been anemic that&#39;s going to come back quickly inflow into Chinese security Rises to record high opinion follows Trend growth impact of credit impulse in China just beginning ladies and gentlemen no one&#39;s been paying attention for the last three quarters we&#39;ve been pounding the table um upcoming upcycle in consumer credit growth lending standards for Consumer grow okay so lending standards for Consumer loans have been going down the other thing is there&#39;s a lot of equity in houses as rates come down people are going to use that as the piggy bank again like we saw almost 20 years ago that&#39;s going to be very um good for the general economy small C positioning everyone&#39;s underway this is it&#39;s it&#39;s been time to buy when newsletters sell so not only are the hedge funds selling in the whole the newsletters are all bearish that&#39;s usually what you see at bottoms this was the only failed signal in early 2022 so everyone&#39;s pulling out their 2022 charts why because of recency bias they look at the most recent experience that they&#39;ve all went through and the 10-year-old money managers uh think that&#39;s the only one so they&#39;re all looking for this to go a lot further I don&#39;t think they&#39;re going to be right in this case uh US dollar and equities rarely fall sharply in tandem for long stretches um S&amp;P US dollar Index last time it happened was 20202 again another parallel we&#39;ve always talked about 20012 2002 which was the time to position where International small cap value everything no one wants and now they&#39;re starting to want it after they&#39;re up a lot but the game is actually just beginning uh asset return expectations oh that&#39;s funny everyone expects Japan to have the highest returns I think the opposite is going to be true uh speculators turned short dollar first time since October so opinion is following Trend as the dollars weakened that can be the beginning of a very long weakening Cycle Plaza Accord style Mar Lago Accord style S&amp;P returns following large declines in US sentiment indicator uh we covered this you know six and 12 months out you&#39;re up double digits if there&#39;s no recession we believe that is going to be the case this year [Music] do boom was way more extreme I think this is kind of interesting here showing the parallel a lot of people use analogs um but we could be in the early 90s stage which was all which would also be very interesting so it&#39;s something to put it in perspective when everyone says we&#39;re going to crash I I think you&#39;re going to see those bounce now not the only game in town International starting to outperform Country composition of the msci all country World index we&#39;ve covered before uh us United States is 64% of the weight it&#39;s not 64% of the earnings power so expect these weights to start to of course they were taking down China exposure just as the earnings start to accelerate so this three just this reminds me a lot of um actually go back and listen to the podcast in 2020 during covid I think the energy sector had gotten down to 2% of the waiting of the S&amp;P 500 down from like 10% and I said this is not sustainable um and and if you remember they were basically threatening pensions and money managers if you invested in energy uh you&#39;d be cancelled effectively and so no one would do it and I said look at the end of the day people want their lights on so it&#39;s a question how much pain they&#39;re going to take before they all flip and that&#39;s exactly what happened the same thing is going to happen with China now uh you&#39;ve dramatically underperformed this year if you had no International exposure uh if you were overweight International you are doing extremely well and smiling so wide you could eat a banana sideways uh so um uh so that&#39;s that and so expect these weights to go up this weight to come down policy uncertainty waiting on us exceptionalism okay again these are people looking at policy when they should be looking at the 10-year jgb S&amp;P performance has historically Reborn rebounded well following Corrections so this is from Capital markets actually shows greater returns than we were talking about but the key is 12 months out double digit returns if no recession we are in that camp double digit returns off the low which could mean again what we had anticipated for the year high single digits overall year returns for the passive indexers in the S&amp;P 500 which means S&amp;P 500 under performs which means stock Pickers win the day uh who are good at it China consumption picks up at year start in line with thesis uh Euro USD reduct the significance of whatever it takes euro is starting to Rally no one&#39;s paying attention I also love the the bo the rally in Boeing that no one&#39;s paying attention to now that&#39;s pretty exciting to me I love when stocks start to rally and people aren&#39;t paying attention because they&#39;re so they got so pessimistic at the lows it reminds me when we were talking about GE at the lows uh and you couldn&#39;t give it away uh and that thing had a monster rally with no one paying attention China&#39;s fiscal stimulus in 2025 will be the largest outside the pandemic that&#39;s big news no one&#39;s paying attention to it this would be the most pension and Target date F okay this would be the most pension and Target date fund buying since March of 2020 okay so they rebalance they get triggered on the basis of draw Downs all that money is flowing in over the next few weeks so pay attention to that Target date funds and for those of you who have already been approved congratulations uh who are already in and funded we&#39;re we&#39;re putting money to work and we&#39;ll put the rest to work next week as well uh and those of you who want to come in in this opening uh do get your inquiries in because it does take about a week to get all the paperwork done and approved and funded and we can start allocating so you can take advantage of these opportunities we&#39;re discussing um uh Chinese EVS are making inroads around the world\n\n Corrections so this is from Capital markets actually shows greater returns than we were talking about but the key is 12 months out double digit returns if no recession we are in that camp double digit returns off the low which could mean again what we had anticipated for the year high single digits overall year returns for the passive indexers in the S&amp;P 500 which means S&amp;P 500 under performs which means stock Pickers win the day uh who are good at it China consumption

2025 will be the largest outside the pandemic that&#39;s big news no one&#39;s paying attention to it this would be the most pension and Target date F okay so this this looks pretty uh pretty regular conference board one-ear expectation of stock prices has collapsed biggest decline ever in 40 years the other big declines were co uh covid lows 2002 so that&#39;s an interesting stat from fun Strat May soon lose its uh us may soon lose its Global stock market leadership Crown we&#39;ve been talking about that and preparing for a while it&#39;s not because us is going to lose their exceptionalism us it&#39;s going to do great I think what&#39;s going to happen is what happened under Trump 1.0 which is that the middle and lower class are going to improve more than the upper class under Trump uh second term so the stock market returns will be more subdued in the US they will dramatically outperform in international uh and they will dramatically outperform for stock Pickers buying those stocks that do well when Trump is in office and avoiding those stocks that have already done well in the rear viw mirror\n\nis is an S&amp;P chart so we see this correction here and then a rally and then check back you know like a lot of stocks rally checkback here&#39;s the checkback that we&#39;re going through right now so this this looks pretty uh pretty regular conference board one-ear expectation of stock prices has collapsed biggest decline ever in 40 years the other big declines were co uh covid lows 2002 so that&#39;s an interesting stat from fun Strat May soon lose its uh us may soon lose its Global stock market leadership Crown we&#39;ve been talking about that and preparing for a while it&#39;s not because us is going to lose their exceptionalism us it&#39;s going to do great I think what&#39;s going to happen is what happened under Trump 1.0 which is that the middle and lower class are going to improve more than the upper class under Trump uh second term so the stock market returns will be more subdued in the US they will dramatically outperform in international uh and they will dramatically outperform for stock Pickers buying those stocks that do well when Trump is in office and avoiding those stocks that have already done well in the rear viw mirror uh and we we do concur here&#39;s another situation here to looking at the trade weighted dollar Index I really like this chart because it talks about when the dollar weakens these different regimes regime one dollar weekend you had us uh you had International outperformance then the dollar strengthened in Reagan&#39;s first term weakened in the second term that was the plaza Accord Peak that we talked about then you had dramatic International equity outperformance and what they&#39;re talking about here uh you can see you know International equities during that period up 17% then you see regime five the dollar weaken from 20032 2003 to 2009 you had uh dramatic uh International outperformance 14% compounded per year versus 5% of us then you had the dollar strengthening follow following 2009 and it what they&#39;re talking about here is  uh dollar now weakening and you&#39;re seeing the international outperform the US and these things go on for at least a handful of years um so more stuff we burden oursel with the facts let&#39;s see here okay from Sarah eyes and here&#39;s the chart

32% of global manufacturing we have lost a m lot of manufacturing share to China well guess what China wants to increase their share of global consumer spending while we want to increase our share of global manufacturing so maybe there&#39;s a deal to be done there and it comes with a reset and a reval of the US dollar to make us more competitive globally they get what they want we get what we want and uh it that how&#39;s that for reciprocal uh so the meeting is imminent us durable goods orders uh motor vehicles and parts are up front loading ahead of tariffs boost us durable goods orders

here is  the rumor the Intel 18a process node which features multiple Technical Innovations and should challenge market leader tsmc in terms of performance and efficiency is ready for production ladies and Gentlemen The Challenge now is to scale up and fill that capacity with new customer orders according to UBS analyst Timothy arcury Intel is closing in on scoring Nvidia as a Foundry cust customer while Intel has both Microsoft and Amazon on board as Intel 18a customers winning over the largest fablous chip designer by Revenue would be an enormous vote of confidence in Intel&#39;s Foundry business the rumor makes sense uh the two are compelling reasons why Nvidia may be keen on shifting some production away from tsmc to Intel first the company is struggling to provide enough gaming gpus to meet demand Nvidia recently launched its RTX 50 Series graphic cards but supply has been extremely tight leading to prices well above MSRP Nvidia makes a lot more money selling data center gpus aimed at AI workloads than it does from gaming gpus so it makes sense that AI chips would be the priority Nvidia only has so much manufacturing capacity at tsmc and the company would be leaving money on the table if it didn&#39;t go all out to meet soaring demand for AI accelerators if Nvidia were to shift gaming GPU production to Intel while leaving AI chip production at tsmc the company would likely have an easier time meeting demand for both products the longer it takes Nvidia to meet demand from Gamers the more likely it becomes that those Gamers give up and move over to gpus from AMD amd&#39;s latest RX 9000 graphics cards are impressive and Nvidia may be losing market share thanks to a rough Supply situation so Nvidia Intel is the only game in town to solve their

cash flow thoughts on this and second question any concern with see single digit slow growth no they&#39;re in their trough they&#39;re generating huge amounts of cash if they continue to grow slow they&#39;ll just buy in a ton of the company uh but more likely than not you&#39;re seeing the new platforms having high growth rates they&#39;ll figure it out and um and until they figure it out they&#39;ll just give me bigger and bigger slices of the pie uh with no new money out of pocket by reducing the float so DSP yeah I mean if you&#39;ve listened for a while so it looks like their cash

have no Edge on whether they&#39;re okay provide vant AI a suite of AI intelligence products\nDickerson uh now that more information has come to light about CPS and future prospects would you ever think about increasing your initial underwriting intrinsic value price or is this something you determine in the beginning and don&#39;t change in order to stay grounded just curious across the board with all Investments you make do you ever reconsider intrinsic value and therefore exit price uh when additional positive information shows up yeah I&#39;ve said many times that you know we can adjust based on new information up or down but on balance I&#39;m probably taking some off at where I intended which I didn&#39;t publicly disclose uh at all so um uh all I can say is it&#39;s it&#39;s a ton higher from here so and probably a meaningful amount of time from here uh but um this one&#39;s going to be a f fantastic one for us so uh no I I generally don&#39;t give credit for the Whi cream there&#39;s a lot of new whip cream that&#39;s come to light but it the story was so attractive even without that you know underwriting it on Icees underwriting it on zero to the rest of the rest of the world uh underwriting it on the cost base they had in place in 2020 2 2 not the revised cost base so yeah but we don&#39;t get in or out of our positions all at once so we could have tranches of our investment that stay on for two times what we thought we would get out and maybe 80 of our position uh 80% of our initial position could be out at or where we determined we would get out before we got in and then the 20 we just hold as a flyer because it&#39;s up you know 710x uh and it&#39;s just a free ride at that point and even if it falls in half we take it off and it&#39;s all free money uh and we don&#39;t worry about it but um that&#39;s that\nSchoolcraft College and I can see the CPS headquarters at the tra in the traffic and don&#39;t see any old rusted out junkers with bad Mufflers could it be that the car that are being built today are better than in the past have a longer exporation maybe 20 or more years if so production would be lower yeah look they&#39;ll run 20 years the question is do you want to be in a 20-year-old clunker I mean these you know in Cuba they run them for 80 years but the point is is when they become affordable and it&#39;s like gener okay the areas where they have the highest growth are the areas that they have the highest concentration so it&#39;s Keeping Up With the Jones it&#39;s when the power goes out and you&#39;re the only schmuck sitting in the dark with no internet and no ref and all your food going rotten and all your neighbors are up and running and you hear the beautiful hum of their gener generator in the neighborhood uh it&#39;s the last time that&#39;s happening to you and you call them up and you plunk down your 25,000 or you finance it as rates come down and the game is on so the areas that have double digit penetration like Michigan and Texas where they have a lot of grid failures genra is growing at the fastest Pace uh and and it just Builds on itself and the areas once you start to see the affordability the average total price come down which is starting to happen and the incentives going up which has been happening\nRob Crest have you continued buying the dip in Advance Auto Parts at

during 2022 to 2024 it&#39;s going to go back to being garbage uh this is a the definition of a broken growth stock I want nothing to do with this thing could trade at one times earnings uh I have no interest in that UPS I&#39;m interested in but it&#39;s not been beaten down enough yet for me to get super interested so uh it&#39;s probably at a decent area I mean let&#39;s take a look at the financials but there&#39;s not enough margin of safety for me to get excited yet probably bounces for technical trade shortterm but longterm to get my double and triple I just don&#39;t see it happening so for me it&#39;s a pass\n### ASK_ME_ANYTHING_QA\nLee Foster I know you&#39;re a single name guy but I was wondering if you ever invested in National ETFs I&#39;m reading contrarian National ETFs I&#39;m looking at Vietnam and Brazil specifically wondering your thoughts well Brazil has a problem problem that we don&#39;t tend to do that um Brazil has a leadership problem it&#39;s run by a socialist kind of funny coming from a guy who&#39;s got his biggest position with a communist country but you know if you can&#39;t take a joke um I think you&#39;re going to be right with that and I think you&#39;re probably going to be right with Vietnam as well um but you know that&#39;s like if you&#39;re super right with Vietnam you make like 70 80% which is not enough for me to initiate a position like if I if I don&#39;t have at least a double I I don&#39;t even allocate Capital uh Brazil you really need that guy out hopefully sooner rather than later to get the boom but I think all International is going to do well so I don&#39;t think those would hurt you VIN sentore would love to hear your opinion on heyer Yale uh probably not yet my man what do these guys do sir Services a line of trucks attachments aftermarket parts yeah the only thing worse than car parts is truck [Music] parts I would say uh maybe ready but I think it&#39;s I don&#39;t know I honestly with this thing I would be looking at i&#39; I&#39;d probably just set an alert at like $35 and if it hit I&#39;d start doing work on it because it&#39;s just such a shitty business that it just has to be left for dead and then I have to say okay they&#39;re not going bankrupt let me see how they compete competitively it&#39;s just there&#39;s not enough margin of safety for for this quality of a business I mean at $5 with Cooper standard if they didn&#39;t go bankrupt I knew I had a triple uh and then from there as they&#39;ve improved the business I know it&#39;s going to be a lot more probably from $5 you know 15 25 times so uh Matt Mitchell uh thoughts on T at these levels high quality business two-thirds of the firm&#39;s assets held in retirement accounts stick your asset piece I don&#39;t like the business [Music] um I think you&#39;re I think you&#39;re right but I don&#39;t like this business enough to get involved I mean this is just a hope that they buy in all the stock and you own a bigger portion of the company it&#39;s probably going to be okay Matt but it&#39;s it&#39;s just it&#39;s not a great business uh Matt Jack trtnik from who knows where ah here we go

companies on sale uh we&#39;re putting in a bottom here and a bottom is messy you can go down and retest the lows uh but there have been 21 Corrections 10% moves or more downward since 1980 and in the 14 where there were no recession which we believe this will be part of 6 months later the Market&#39;s up 9% on average we&#39;re seeing sentiment flushed out a aii sentiment survey this morning there&#39;s only 21% of retail investors are bullish 58% are bearish but on the smart money side what you&#39;re seeing is Corporate insiders are buying back stock to the largest extent since the lows in 2022 so the the concerns is a slowing economy prices remaining higher um you know the dreaded stagflation uh concern and with tariffs it&#39;s just uncertainty at this point I mean those fears are they Justified well certainly they&#39;re Justified but that that&#39;s what creates dislocation in prices they don&#39;t give away doubles for free you have to buy it when everyone is selling in the hole and this is one of those opportunities you saw record Put buying by retail investors last week they were buying insurance after the house had burned down you saw records selling in the hole by hedge funds these are contrarian indicators if you buy during these times and you buy selectively and you buy high quality and you look 12 months out later you&#39;ve done really really well and

up to he says a lot of success in life and business comes from knowing what you want to avoid I.E early death a bad marriage uh Etc and uh and this is easy you know a lot of people always say to me gosh you look so young I was like yeah I don&#39;t do drugs and I don&#39;t drink much like what else do you want to know so you know things you want to avoid early death uh Robert arnard in investing what is comfortable is rarely profitable and um I think there&#39;s a corollary to that which goes uh what starts uncomfortable comes very uncom becomes very comfortable over time as we&#39;ve seen in many of the names Through The Years here on hedge fund tips with Tom Hayes uh and then David teer in order to get that Comfort what do you need to do the key is to wait sometimes the hardest thing to do is to do nothing and uh that&#39;s key and that&#39;s why having a good hobby like golf comes in handy uh when you&#39;re tempted by the devil of activity you want to get into to inactivity when you&#39;ve bought right and you&#39;ve bought quality at good prices you just wait and play the time Arbitrage game and that is a unique advantage in the market\n### TECHNICAL_CHARTS\nrelative performance of sectors I think this has been a unique year that caught a lot of people by surprise but no one on the hedge fund tips with Tom Hayes Money Train was taken by surprise because uh you were ready the last shall be first and they were you can see here uh reach outperformed the S&amp;P 500 year to date uh Chinese stocks outperform the S&amp;P dramatically year to date by the way this is a secular turn um uh you know similar to what we saw 2016 to 2018 then you know 2019 to 2021 and here we&#39;ve put in even bigger base the the longer the base the higher the space and uh this is just getting going then we&#39;ve got uh bonds have outperformed the S&amp;P year to date uh that took a lot of people by surprise no one here uh biotech we love this setup here putting in the bottom just like we saw here in 2020 you had a bottom kind of a double bottom type of her or reverse Head and Shoulders however you want to look at it I think biotech is poised to Rocket we&#39;re going to look at some of that then uh materials outperform the S&amp;P all the stuff that we talked about if you remember from our last Shelby first you can find all the old posts on hedge fund tips with Tom Hayes just go down to commentary you can see of our weekly articles going back five some OD years or you can just go to video cast here under categories and see every single video cast uh or podcast if you like to listen uh communication Services looks like it&#39;s stalling out relative to the S&amp;P uh energy okay you remember go back to the podcast in 2020 when oil was negative we were buying like crazy here we had more pain and then they just just took off like crazy I remember buying Exxon at $33 when oil was negative and pounding the table on the podcast went a little against us before it went off took absolutely took off and then we were laying off in 2022 and everyone was getting excited about it and they basically done nothing since um so now it looks like it wants to take another leg higher energy is again we continue to pay attention to we continue to have exposure through Comstock which has been a home run uh probably be a three bagger within within a few months from where we bought uh already two plus and uh just beginning with that one financials relative to the S&amp;P has had the huge run we laid off a lot we still have some Regional exposure I think on the next major rally we&#39;re going to take that off uh believe it or not so we were able to take off the banks in the summer uh after a huge run in city and Bank of America after the March remember the March mini banking crisis we were hand over fist uh and we took off uh over the summer so let&#39;s see what happens with that um but we&#39;re waiting for the next big rally to get rid of regionals uh xli at a very nice profit xli industrial starting to outperform relative to so we look at this to find sectors we want to drill down on to find Opportunities and the key with the opportunities is I think what most people is they&#39;re they like a a normal business person&#39;s mindset is you get paid for activity Massive Action equals massive results and I think a lot of people just get distracted by the new shiny object uh and rather than holding to great quality businesses unless something has changed in our thesis if we have a new idea it has to be so much better than an existing idea in the portfolio to take something out that has hasn&#39;t yet reached full intrinsic value the the the we determined prior to entering the position in order to replace it so um uh but anyway Tech has underperformed relative to the S&amp;P no surprise to us surprise to many uh Staples have outperformed we got a they got a little defensive um you know we like a little exposure there through the baers of the world through the horels of the world but nothing crazy and um same thing with utilities this is all going to be a function of rates continuing to go lower we&#39;ll talk about that which we have Healthcare same story a defensive starting to outperform Baxter I think biotech is going to pick up into that very quickly discretionary has absolutely rolled over with consumer sentiment relative to the S&amp;P there&#39;s going to be some opportunity to buy some stuff there and that&#39;s how we kind of an overview then we look at bullish percentage these are the percentage of stocks in the sector on a point and figure Buy Signal we don&#39;t use point and figure but this is a useful indicator to see different sectors we have found communication Services already started to rebound uh NASDAQ composit starting to rebound there&#39;s opportunity there like I said in previous media interviews uh Tech and mag 7 are going to bounce I do think they&#39;re going to underperform for the year maybe trade back up to the top of the range which most people are going to say see they&#39;re the best blah blah blah and then they&#39;ll stall out again uh consumer discretionary I think there&#39;s a lot to do here the VF Corps of the world Nike if we didn&#39;t own VF Corp but Nike has a little bit bigger in other words Nike is where VF Corp was a year and a half ago when we got involved with Brack and Daryl um I think it&#39;s going to take a little longer than people expect but I think Nike will be back over time uh just not yet and not as soon as most people think uh energy again uh starting to move move gold miners don&#39;t really care healthc care opportunity there you know I keep looking at the fisers of the world and uh continue to pass we have exposure through biotech and through Baxter um bullish industry Industrials this is just getting started the generx the uh boeings well yeah boeings the um Stanley Black and Deckers this is all going to be the way with the construction trade which we&#39;re going to spend some time on and it&#39;s funny I&#39;ve had in my mind two conflicting thoughts and that&#39;s very common uh as you get experienced in the business and the the the one thought is that the economy is going to continue to do really really well for the next five years because of the Baby Boomers because of certain policies because of a lot of different things um uh we can expect material strength at least for another 5 years before we get a lost decade probably 10 years 8 to 10 years but um at the same time I&#39;m in Orange County and I&#39;m I&#39;m thinking about real estate here and I continue to say this this just feels bubbleisha reset and I&#39;m saying to myself well how can this possibly be when we have hous housing shortage of 3.8 million units how are prices ever going to come down like part of me is okay the Chinese own 11% of the housing stock now that everything&#39;s going back up in China they&#39;re going to get fomo they&#39;re going to stop pushing their money out of uh China and the marginal bid the marginal buyer in Orange County and some of these cities around the country is going to evaporate and when that evaporates you hit an air pocket and you get a reset and the economy can still be strong even if that resets and that that&#39;s part of the thesis we&#39;re going to get to some policy things that may yield a booming economy and either consolidating home prices meaning they can just run sideways for many years and not go up uh or actually correcting home prices but not correcting in a way where you wind up with a 2008 once in a 100y year event correcting in a way like it got ahead of itself because of Co and some un natural government intervention that needs to be flushed through uh and the overall economy can continue to flourish so that&#39;s where we see the industrial opportunity uh Tech again these are going to bounce there&#39;s a lot to do there we&#39;ve got a bunch of exposure uh and then materials uh this one I think there&#39;s immense opportunities we&#39;ve got albam Maro I think that&#39;s going to be a monster for us uh relatively new position and then um nysse is starting to bounce these are kind of more the industrial names real estate bounced pulling back a little bit you&#39;re going to see the CCIS of the world in the reach continue to Rally uh bullish percent SPX I think this is I think you know I&#39;ve said it on the media for the last week or so and Market probably bottomed a couple weeks ago tried to go back and retest didn&#39;t quite do it I I think we put the bottom in and uh I&#39;m super glad for the new people that have come in uh now that their money&#39;s getting to work right away because I think we&#39;re going to be straight up to the summer as I had said and yes I know we have uh April 2nd looming so we&#39;ll keep some dry powder to put money to work if some crazy thing happens but if you look at most of the stocks that are going to be affected by it um they&#39;ve kind of you know this is like this is going to be the biggest known surprise in humanity I think it&#39;s going to be the sell the rumor by the news scenario all over again and most people are think they have some Edge like tariffs are coming like who the hell has not heard about that like turn on your local news Fox 5 you don&#39;t need to turn on Fox Business for that uh all you need to do is have a heartbeat and you know that that&#39;s coming which means if everyone knows it it&#39;s probably priced and if you look at most of the industrial stocks uh and Auto Part suppliers and everything else uh you know a lot of that&#39;s priced so when it actually happens or if it happens you know less than expected uh there&#39;s only upside downsides kind of priced in and that that&#39;s our our based case and you know you get the Bears that&#39;ll all say oh the Market&#39;s being too conservative maybe in the short term maybe you get some short-term volatility but uh that&#39;s that&#39;s not how we think about it the businesses that we buy uh and I always say you can&#39;t invest over things you have no control so the businesses that we buy the demand for the items and the competitive Moes that they have are going to be unchanged irrespective of how much of that gets passed through the consumer

but a lot of them are once in 10 or 15 years uh and that's a lot of time to get you know to be able to buy it at such amazing prices and get doubles triples quadruples over the next handful of years and that that Windows pretty much closing so um I want to congratulate all the uh people who've come in the last just week and a half Alone um and um and many of you have already been approved by interactive brokers I don't know what they're doing over there but they've got their act together and you know these applications are getting approved in uh you know day or two versus a week which is exciting and funded so we're going to get get money to work now get money to work after uh April 2nd and and rock and roll so but you can see I mean yes Baba a lot of people miss that I mean it's going a lot higher there's no question about it but you know we're now up 120% off the lows so um you know hopefully for those of you who don't have enough exposure if you're lucky you'll get you know High 120s to get back in maybe mid10 but don't hold your breath this thing the train has left the station we told you that would be happening that's already happened all these other names that you guys are pessimistic on they're next so if you thought this was a surprise which you shouldn't think it's a damn surprise because we spent two years telling you what was going to happen uh just wait till you see the next batch and what's going to take place and it's so funny I had some new clients like I've been listening to you for over a year I thought I knew how you invested I had no idea I'm looking at the portfolio he's like I would have never figured this out I was like well you know what else do you want me to tell you uh you know that that the you're a client now it's a different game so uh anyway so Baxter um you know again this is a defensive stock they take a you know year year and a half two years to base every cycle here we are and then it just goes straight up and it recaptures new highs why because it has a moat the IV business it's the switching costs are high their pumps are fantastic and they got rid of the lowquality business the low growth business called the kidney business and you can't give it away and that's what happens right before they go to the room now today on Cooper standard everyone's nervous about the tariffs I I pray to God we get a 15 handle because I really didn't want to put new clients in this thing at 17 bucks even though it's going a lot higher over the next few years uh so I pray to God we get some serious fear in the next week and I can get a 154 handle on this and do one final absolute load the boat but I don't think we're going to get it so we'll see uh Disney uh Disney I like here I I would put new money to work but um uh you know this is going to take a few years and it's going to work its way back to New highs and Beyond uh PayPal uh or gen rather so look you bought in the 90s wrote up to to 195 that's great this is the beginning this is the next phase this is what it does so if you look back to 2016 same exact thing you know you get this Panic selloff Fountain double check then you rally up everyone gets excited gets in at 195 you smoke them out you drop 33% and then you just start to move up to the next major major move so 3 years from now this thing's going to be a ton higher uh a lot of people probably got knocked out here I would put new money to work here for sure um and probably will Intel lip bhan we're going to cover some of that today this is going to be fantastic that's all I can tell you uh small caps final breather before the move higher um Banks I think we're going to get another rally here we'll probably lay off on the next rally PayPal same exact story you come out of these lows you get the check backs scare everyone out and then you take your next leg higher this time just like we saw with Baba by the way this this is this is standard Fair ladies and gentlemen because you just get the dumb money that come in right after you have the massive rallies then you take them all out and then you take the next huge leg up and then they'll buy up here at 160 take it back to 140 before you let them off the bus and then you go straight to 200 plus and that's the way the game works so um all right where were we PayPal this is a home run uh this this I'm putting new money to work for sure uh Stanley Black and&amp; Decker this is the most leveraged play on the housing recovery which I'm going to tell you why is coming to a theater near you very quickly I love this play um bonds double head and shoulders bottom here started to Rally beginning of the year we'll consolid a little bit they're going to continue to rally for the foreseeable future which helps all of our thesis whether it be at home builders and uh we talked about last year with last week with what Scott Besson is doing on the um Capital charges for banks removing some of those restrictions uh is going to lower the 10 year by another 30 basis points takes it on three takes 10e mortgages under six and you have not seen anything like a housing boom of what you're going to see over the next five years in terms of Supply so what how do we want to play that again do we want you know just like the pent up demand in cars do we want to be the one fighting the war where these car companies oems are going to be fighting against each other for share and discounting and offering incentives no we want to be the Arms Dealer like Cooper standard selling a ceiling as they as they lower prices and volumes go through the roof with a 13 and a half year uh average car on the road let them kill each other overprice we're going to sell them the the weapons which is which is the ceiling and the fluid transfer systems and we're we get paid on volumes it's going to be the same with the housing the home builders um are going to be producing tons and tons and tons of houses with all the new land available to build and uh the ones that are going to benefit are going to be the um uh homeb Building Supplies Distributors and those type of businesses like qxo with Brad Jacobs which we own and uh had had an opportunity to be able to participate in the early days that is one that you just buy and you wake up in eight years and you've got a seven to 10 bagger I mean that's how Brad Jacob rolls and uh the guy's a winner he knows how how to do a creative Acquisitions he knows how to add technology value ad to drive profits synergies and then he knows how to play the multiple Arbitrage games so yes he paid up for Beacon but you can you can be sure tucks and um um Acquisitions in a fragmented Market he's going to be able to buy at lower multiples and get the public market multiple um Arbitrage and it's going to be fantastic so excited for that VF Corp same exact story every single cycle rallies off the lows checks back takes everyone off the bus and then goes back on to new highs same thing here rallies makes everyone doubt it and then back to to new highs so it takes a little while to consolidate and Brad uh Brack and Daryl's going to take this thing back up to new highs and it's going to be you know a handful of years but off of a 13 $15 basis you're going to wind up with a seven bagger so I mean you know uh or you can just switch to the next shiny object and keep missing great opportunities uh biotech same thing every cycle you get this bottoming another fake out like we had last year then you rally up fake them one last time and then you another parabolic move so 130 140 would not surprise me in a reasonable amount of time okay chart of the week let's see where we are I thought this was going to be a short one because we had them by the way if you missed the amazing interview with Jeff Edwards CEO of Cooper standard last week be sure to check in either at our YouTube station just go to YouTube and enter hedge fund tips uh or uh hedge fund tips with Tom Hayes podcast episode 283 was phenomenal so let's talk about CTA uh positioning in US equities they got this low in the hole in 2022 they got this low in uh the covid lows when we were pounding the table to buy uh in Fall of 2023 all of these were great buying opportunities they're down at these levels now that's the reason we've been talking this is very interesting the road from Plaza the Plaza to Mar Lago the dollars approaching valuations hit in 1985 this is super important because uh this was Reagan's second term first year of second term just like it's Trump first year of second term uh dollar was weak they wanted they excuse me the dollar was record strong they wanted it weak and they met at the plaza it was named after the Plaza Hotel in New York City um which uh I think oddly enough I don't know if Trump owned it at that time that's kind of funny I think he owned it at that time uh anyway they came to an agreement between France West Germany Japan United Kingdom the United States to depreciate the US dollar in relationship to the Frank the Deutsch Mark the Yen and the British pound sterling by intervening in currency markets the dollar depreciated significantly from the time of the agreement until it was replaced by the Lou Ray Accord the Lou Accord in 1987 uh some commentators believe the plaza Accord continued to contributed to let me highlight this so you guys don't miss it contributed to the Japanese asset price bubble of the late 1980s ladies and gentlemen I'm going to step out on a limb here and say if there there are Rumblings about a Mara Lago Accord okay and t\n\nis is an S&amp;P chart so we see this correction here and then a rally and then check back you know like a lot of stocks rally checkback here&#39;s the checkback that we&#39;re going through right now so this this looks pretty uh pretty regular conference board one-ear expectation of stock prices has collapsed biggest decline ever in 40 years the other big declines were co uh covid lows 2002 so that&#39;s an interesting stat from fun Strat May soon lose its uh us may soon lose its Global stock market leadership Crown we&#39;ve been talking about that and preparing for a while it&#39;s not because us is going to lose their exceptionalism us it&#39;s going to do great I think what&#39;s going to happen is what happened under Trump 1.0 which is that the middle and lower class are going to improve more than the upper class under Trump uh second term so the stock market returns will be more subdued in the US they will dramatically outperform in international uh and they will dramatically outperform for stock Pickers buying those stocks that do well when Trump is in office and avoiding those stocks that have already done well in the rear viw mirror uh and we we do concur here&#39;s another situation here to looking at the trade weighted dollar Index I really like this chart because it talks about when the dollar weakens these different regimes regime one dollar weekend you had us uh you had International outperformance then the dollar strengthened in Reagan&#39;s first term weakened in the second term that was the plaza Accord Peak that we talked about then you had dramatic International equity outperformance and what they&#39;re talking about here uh you can see you know International equities during that period up 17% then you see regime five the dollar weaken from 20032 2003 to 2009 you had uh dramatic uh International outperformance 14% compounded per year versus 5% of us then you had the dollar strengthening follow following 2009 and it what they&#39;re talking about here is  uh dollar now weakening and you&#39;re seeing the international outperform the US and these things go on for at least a handful of years um so more stuff we burden oursel with the facts let&#39;s see here okay from Sarah eyes and here&#39;s the chart on the global imbalance that the Trump Administration is trying to adjust us makes up 29% of global consumption but only 15% of global manufacturing China makes up 12% of global consumer spending and 32% of global manufacturing we have lost a m lot of manufacturing share to China well guess what China wants to increase their share of global consumer spending while we want to increase our share of global manufacturing so maybe there&#39;s a deal to be done there and it comes with a reset and a reval of the US dollar to make us more competitive globally they get what they want we get what we want and uh it that how&#39;s that for reciprocal uh so the meeting is imminent us durable goods orders uh motor vehicles and parts are up front loading ahead of tariffs boost us durable goods orders so a lot of front row uh loaded production should help Cooper standard in q1 which is pretty exciting and uh Jeff Edwards alluded to as much on the uh interview we did last week growth expectations us has peaked while the Euro area is too low according to mrb Partners",
    "MISCELLANEOUS": "\n\n bullish percent SPX I think this is I think you know I&#39;ve said it on the media for the last week or so and Market probably bottomed a couple weeks ago tried to go back and retest didn&#39;t quite do it I I think we put the bottom in and uh I&#39;m super glad for the new people that have come in uh now that their money&#39;s getting to work right away because I think we&#39;re going to be straight up to the summer as I had said and yes I know we have uh April 2nd looming so we&#39;ll keep some dry powder to put money to work if some crazy thing happens but if you look at most of the stocks that are going to be affected by it um they&#39;ve kind of you know this is like this is going to be the biggest known surprise in humanity I think it&#39;s going to be the sell the rumor by the news scenario all over again and most people are think they have some Edge like tariffs are coming like who the hell has not heard about that like turn on your local news Fox 5 you don&#39;t need to turn on Fox Business for that uh all you need to do is have a heartbeat and you know that that&#39;s coming which means if everyone knows it it&#39;s probably priced and if you look at most of the industrial stocks uh and Auto Part suppliers and everything else uh you know a lot of that&#39;s priced so when it actually happens or if it happens you know less than expected uh there&#39;s only upside downsides kind of priced in and that that&#39;s our our based case and you know you get the Bears that&#39;ll all say oh the Market&#39;s being too conservative maybe in the short term maybe you get some short-term volatility but uh that&#39;s that&#39;s not how we think about it the businesses that we buy uh and I always say you can&#39;t invest over things you have no control so the businesses that we buy the demand for the items and the competitive Moes that they have are going to be unchanged irrespective of how much of that gets passed through the consumer there is  a fixed amount of demand that&#39;s not going to go away now could it hurt at the margins for a few weeks or or a couple of quarters sure but it&#39;s not going to change share because their competitors are all going to have the same climate that they have to operate in so therefore it&#39;s a short-term reset for a long-term reward if you get the worst case scenario and if you don&#39;t then it&#39;s just massive money made to the upside overnight and no one gets let in so uh you know take your risk like modest down downside volatility uh because of a a knee-jerk reaction in the

about a Mara Lago Accord okay and t\n\nTrump has shown his hand that he wants a weaker dollar to give us an advantage with trade with paying off the debt with everything else that comes down to it if they were to negotiate a maral Lago Accord and depreciate the US dollar this would not contribute to a Japanese asset price bubble over the next four years this would contribute to a Chinese asset price bubble of the late 20 22s and I think that all of the pieces of the puzzle are coming together that this would not surprise me at all and I think this could be the fuel for the last parabolic move in China before they come to two three lost decades like the Japanese have due to demographic miscalculations that cannot be Unwound in the next decade plus so um and and and that would certainly cause the marginal bid in using US housing certainly in areas like Orange County to evaporate um and cause a major air pocket because if everything is going up around them they&#39;re not going to pay the friction uh and the risk of getting additional money out of the country they&#39;ll keep what they got out of China here uh because it&#39;s so hard to get it out but when you&#39;ve got more opportunity domestically and you got friction to get money out to to a place where the opportunities are not as good in the short term uh all you have to do is look at people&#39;s incentives and you know how they&#39;re going to act but um this is setting up very very similarly so keep an eye on the mara logo Accord moving forward jackma backed ant TOS touts AI breakthrough using Chinese Chips uh jackma used ant group jackma backed ant Group Company used chinese-made semiconductors to develop techniques for AI training models that would cut cost by 20% according to people familiar with the matter an used domestic chips including from affiliate Alibaba Holding Group and Huawei to train models using the so-called mixture of experts machine learning approach the people said it got results similar to those from Nvidia Corp chips like the h800 they said asking not to be named as the information isn&#39;t public ladies and gentlemen necessity is the mother of invention that is big news Alibaba stocks gains its AI chips could be gaining Traction in China China adviser urges boosting consumption to 70% of GDP by 2035 uh they want to be like the us and what is the biggest toll taker of Chinese consumption for the middle and up upper class it&#39;s called Alibaba tbell t-all Etc and we are poised to benefit from that Alibaba launches new open- source AI model for cost effective AI agents Chinese consumer company signal spending is picking up again forget the mag 7 the terrific 10 are the tech bet for 2025 what are the notice the author is different when we&#39;re talking about

make this stuff up ladies and gentlemen after 100% rally opinion follows Trend and they get to be right for the next year to two years as this thing goes parabolic they&#39;ll get super duper excited when it&#39;s near its top and we will be laying off into their upgrades you us at just as we were buying into their downgrades us adds export restrictions to more Chinese Tech firms over security concerns just make them more for they&#39;re we&#39;re forcing them to do business away from us uh and to learn how to do it themselves and they&#39;ve done it a lot sooner than we could have imagined if we we had kept them dependent on our chips uh they would be a decade behind as we look out but they are it is what it is CH uh Trump Aly Ally visits Beijing to pave way for X Summit so Trump and X are going to meet uh Intel CEO lip Buu tan completes $25 million stock by and here&#39;s the beauty of it ladies and gentlemen he paid $25 million for 1 million 43,46 shares on March 26 the price per share was $23.96 most of you have basy well better than the CEO of the company and you probably still have a very limited window to lock that in talk about aligned interest with a partner super exciting news Bank of America mortgage applications jumped 80% in q1 says the executive which is kind of interesting when you think about consumer sentiment was in the gutter Etc but you had a few weeks there where mortgage rates came down wait till they drop below six and this thing goes all in this is what I&#39;m talking about Trump moves forward with plans to use federal land to build affordable housing so Nationwide the federal government owns about 1 million square miles of land or about 27% of the country&#39;s total land area the new initiative will focus on the roughly 500 million Acres managed by the department of the interior which oversees National Park Parks and Wildlife refugees so you will get not only a beautiful 1800 squ foot home by KB Homes but an endangered elk in your backyard free of charge all right uh joking not joking so um so here&#39;s the deal this announ this announcement follows a recent report from realor.com which found that the industry has a housing Supply gap of at least $3.8 million units at the current pace of construction it would take more than seven years for Supply to catch up with demand um in the joint oped in the Wall Street Journal bergam and Turner said that the inter agency task force would work to reduce red tape associated with building on Federal Land and cut through the bureaucracy to Spur new Housing Development so what they&#39;re basically saying is that we&#39;ve had so much trouble in municipalities because people don&#39;t want crowding in their own backyard that we&#39;re going to just open up this land and build there&#39;s another aspect because they really struggle in the suburbs more than they do in the cities people don&#39;t move into the cities because they want to be by themselves they move into the city because they want proximity they want people around them Etc there&#39;s another thing that they&#39;re going to do with some of the tax credits in the cities to force the local uh politicians to to cut the red tape so I think you&#39;re going to get greater density in the cities and I think you&#39;re going to get greater density in the excerts uh where these Federal lands are where they can build massive amounts of houses now that a lot of people can work hybrid and and that type of thing and businesses will pop up just like they did in the suburbs uh in the 80s so uh we will open up portions of federal land for large large scale housing construction these zones will be ultra low tax ultra low regulation we are going to open our country to building homes inexpensively young people uh and other people can buy homes so two things are going to happen one you get the Chinese marginal buyer in the expensive areas evaporating because there&#39;s more opportunities in the short term in China to make more money in a shorter amount of time number two you&#39;re going to get the opening of the federal land 500 million acres to build these 3.8 million um and number three is we&#39;re going to get to in just a minute is basically here the City Journal piece from Christ Christopher Elmendorf and Alex arich and he said uh Trump ordered uh his departments on day one to deliver emergency price relief including action to lower the cost of housing and expand the housing Supply so what they&#39;re proposing is how housing is too expensive because its development is overregulation yet the regulations that drive up housing costs Arcane local zoning and building codes are not the kinds that Congressional Republicans are best to fight however many of the local codes protect Suburban single family home neighborhoods and a residential ideal that Trump has pointedly defended in a new paper we suggest one way out of this dilemma Target big expensive cities for housing growth while letting States decide for themselves what to do about the suburbs specifically we propose to reallocate Federal affordable housing tax credits A roughly $15 billion subsidy away from the nation&#39;s biggest most expensive cities unless they adopt a basic set of pro housing reform specifically to retain their eligibility for the federal affordable housing subsidy these cities would have to allow development of apartment and condo buildings along major corridors and in commercial areas cap development fees at $10,000 per new unit roughly the national average wave provide waivers from Price controls that render a project infeasible and approve projects that conform to applicable standards ministerially that is without discre discretionary reviews and Associated conditions of approval that may change a Project&#39;s design or increase its cost Congress should also task a federal agency with developing criteria for measuring City&#39;s housing performance such as housing stock growth relative to potential growth given prices and partial characteristics persistently poor performers should lose their eligibility for federal subsidies regardless of whether they have opted into the Federal Pro housing reforms our proposal is Bud budget neutral and State neutral this is important if a city like New York chooses not to relax its regulations the tax credits it foregoes would flow to affordable housing projects elsewhere in the state the new agency uh the new policy would put significant pressure on Big City governments to develop pro- housing reforms since Progressive City Council Members won&#39;t want to be seen forfeiting affordable housing funds the suburbs would be unaffected however as the new policy would apply only to big expensive cities so you basically bracket it the suburbs where everyone&#39;s nimi not in my backyard let them let them have what they want you&#39;ve got 500 million of federal lands that&#39;s going to be all in massive production and then now you force the cities into it which um really really could be effective and that&#39;s how I think we get a renewed affordability and housing in a Rel relatively short period of time so again we&#39;ve got to find some ways to play the arms dealers and I think the number one company to start with and I and and I&#39;ve got a lot more on on my radar is going to be qxo okay which we have a nice position from lower levels and we are going to uh hopefully be able to use any opportunities to get more and set and forget for a long time because he&#39;s he&#39;s going to be in the game in a major way and an effective way so these are the Articles you can see here this shows where all the federal land is yellow is Bureau of Land Management it&#39;s mostly in the west um Bureau of Indian Affairs Department of Defense fish and wildlife Service Forest Service etc etc etc so this is where you&#39;re going to see huge amounts of construction in the west sales incentives on home deliveries as a percentage of Revenue the they&#39;re going to continue to produce and build they just don&#39;t know it yet uh it&#39;s going to be a race to the bottom for their margins and uh the building supply companies are going to make fortunes uh supplying the arms to the Battlers which are going to be the uh KB Homes the lenars ETC they&#39;ll make money don&#39;t get me wrong they&#39;re going to benefit from this as well but I want to be on the other side of it Japan inflation slows but the uptrend backs the case for raid hikes we&#39;ve said this over and over as a matter of fact we posted on Twitter um it&#39;s kind of funny yesterday they were all saying that oh the Tariff the markets down because of the tariffs and if you actually looked at the stock market it was kind of funny I had to post this and I don&#39;t like commenting day-to-day must be about the auto tariffs meanwhile the only stocks that were down were the mag 7 everything else in the market was up and and every single journalist uh on TV was saying it was the auto tariffs this is all Trump&#39;s fault and these were the stocks that were down what was going on the Japanese 10-year jgb yield was going to 20y year high high and what we&#39;ve talked about regularly for the last 6 months is to watch the unwind of the carry trade as the cost-free money starts to have a cost uh all the leverage that was embedded in the carry trade you you shorting Yen get free currency to then put into the most crowded trades which is mag 7 is unwinding and that is the day but here&#39;s year to date what&#39;s down only the mag s so like people keep asking me when&#39;s this going to stop I was like when&#39;s what going to stop we&#39;re up I mean this has been an unbelievable year so uh and and this is where most people are stuck the passive indexers are getting slammed because they&#39;re overweight in all these names that have been hit the hardest and they don&#39;t realize has nothing to do with tariffs has nothing to do with customer sentiment has to do with the unwind of Leverage that was embedded in the carry trade so as the Japanese inflation uh continues to pick up uh they will have to raise carry trade on wines all that hot money comes out of the hottest uh most crowd trades and you see more of this I think we&#39;re probably through another phase of this and these are going to get a bounce but uh every day when you see the market down just go look at uh 10year jgbs and that&#39;ll tell you the answer and all the commentators can you know blame policies that are unrelated to the stocks that are actually down Jack ma backed an TOS a touts AI breakthrough using Chinese Chips Alibaba stock oh we&#39;re okay here we go we got so much to cover I thought this was going to be an easy one today ladies and gentlemen we got a lot to cover here uh so this is kind of what&#39;s happening with cars smaller cars and smaller houses are going to be the name of the game for the next five years which is going to lead to massive volumes which is going to help Cooper standard which is a OEM supplier and um the building suppliers which are OEM suppliers I guess I guess lenar and KB and toll are considered oems in the housing business uh so what you&#39;re seeing is some of the mid the compact SUVs are going up subc compact the compact cars midsize trucks uh and everything going down fixed housing affordability index housing has not been this unaffordable since 20062 7 so how does that got res resolved uh last time it was through deleveraging and helocs coming due and a big crash this time it&#39;s going to be more and more options becoming available and once you have a massive supply of options um prices come down and you&#39;re going to see the same thing for labor as well I ran an ad for a personal assistant I I can&#39;t even tell you I need an assistant to go through all the applications I got for an assistant I mean you can&#39;t make this stuff up um it&#39;s staggering now so the the shift is so so what I&#39;m saying is wage inflation is com coming down which we all know uh why because there&#39;s a greater supply of labor than demand for labor right now and the same is going to happen as the supply picks up on Federal Land and in cities through the coercion tactics that I discussed uh and this will finish now National home prices change I am a master of patterns and I can tell you this pattern is pretty obvious ladies and gentlemen\n\nar jgbs and that&#39;ll tell you the answer and all the commentators can you know

will finish now National home prices change I am a master of patterns and I can tell you this pattern is pretty obvious ladies and gentlemen\nhere is  the national home price changes and just for Simplicity let&#39;s use real versus nominal prices and what you can see is the first part of the 20th century it just went back and forth pretty regularly that was before the 30-year mortgage by the way uh then the 18s to the 30s same thing uh then post World War II this is when the game got interesting so you&#39;d have 3 to five years of growth followed by 3 to five years of contraction 3 to five years of growth three to five years of contraction three to you know and more back and forth every three to five years growth contraction you had massive contraction people forget uh in real terms from 1989 to 1996 that was the last Orange County housing crisis which was caused by the Japanese hot flows coming out after the China Market peaked so uh that&#39;s kind of an interesting parallel 97 through 2004 and then 2006 to 2011 contraction then expansion basically since 2012 straight up till now that&#39;s one of the longest runs post World War II it actually is barring 8 97 to 2006 was a pretty long run 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 N9 here we have 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 then you had one year negative in 2022 last two years have been flat so these type of this is an extreme is what I&#39;m trying to telling you and then what the case that I was making was what how could you be generally constructive on the economy even though I see International stocks out pering domestic but I&#39;m still constructive on the economy because of the baby boom demographic Etc else uh and yet think housing prices are going to compress in certain areas or in Aggregate and I think you know there are similar examples in the early 90s you had you know booms in new technologies and and the and General stock market but you really had some housing and banking crises from just overheating through this period of 83 to 88 uh that needed to consolidate uh and uh and I think that&#39;s probably a pretty interesting par uh parallel to consider home prices versus inflation here&#39;s home price appreciation has dramatically exceeded inflation this runs in Cycles it under performed in the 30s and 40s outperformed in the 60s and has outperformed uh last few years this will converge and I think for some of the reasons that I&#39;m talking about real home price appreciation adjusted for inflation uh going all the way to 2024 so you can see this has been a really aggressive move uh not none seen like this since the 202 2006 Peak um this is and this is only showing to 2022 uh I you know it&#39;s funny I look at Tik Tok and I see all these Trends in 2022 you literally couldn&#39;t get to your feed every single person was every schmock was making a fortune in real estate and selling courses on how to make money in real estate etc etc etc and um that&#39;s what you see in in extreme so uh us median housing payment as a percentage of median income again highest since 2006 again not calling for that type of Crash but I think the early 90s is a really really good parallel in terms of housing prices uh declining and disruption in the housing market price-wise not supply wise uh while the economy and the stock market does well and international stocks do extremely well uh United States 57% affordability Gap income needed to buy versus actual so this is all from Charlie Bello uh you can see some of these major cities starting to come down Tampa or grow at slower Paces I think you&#39;re going to see more of those hit the list uh increase over the last five years average hourly earnings have grown 25% us home prices have grown 53% these will converge i a mean reversion guy us home price growth by decade uh so I mean this is mindboggling so real annualized the highest decade was 40 through 49 followed by 2010 to 2019 and 2020 to 2024 is double the highest basically at 4.6 the average for the last 133 years has been half a percent per year real uh part of the reason for that is the American homes have doubled in size so uh this is another theme I think we&#39;re going to be going to massive increase in volume of cars and houses a massive reduction in size in both cars and houses because we&#39;re meeting the needs of the people who need it which is our people starting families uh not people in their you know mid to late 40s early 50s who want to upgrade to the big house to you know be the biggest on the Block uh Etc so uh that&#39;ll be the next phase\n\n### MACRO_DATA_SLIDES\nnot none seen like this since the 202 2006 Peak um this is and this is only showing to 2022 uh I you know it&#39;s funny I look at Tik Tok and I see all these Trends in

recession we are in that camp double digit returns off the low which could mean again what we had anticipated for the year high single digits overall year returns for the passive indexers in the S&amp;P 500 which means S&amp;P 500 under performs which means stock Pickers win the day uh who are good at it China consumption picks up at year start in line with thesis uh Euro USD reduct the significance of whatever it takes euro is starting to Rally no one&#39;s paying attention I also love the the bo the rally in Boeing that no one&#39;s paying attention to now that&#39;s pretty exciting to me I love when stocks start to rally and people aren&#39;t paying attention because they&#39;re so they got so pessimistic at the lows it reminds me when we were talking about GE at the lows uh and you couldn&#39;t give it away uh and that thing had a monster rally with no one paying attention China&#39;s fiscal stimulus in 2025 will be the largest outside the pandemic that&#39;s big news no one&#39;s paying attention to it this would be the most pension and Target date F okay so this this looks pretty uh pretty regular conference board one-ear expectation of stock prices has collapsed biggest decline ever in 40 years the other big declines were co uh covid lows 2002 so that&#39;s an interesting stat from fun Strat May soon lose its uh us may soon lose its Global stock market leadership Crown we&#39;ve been talking about that and preparing for a while it&#39;s not because us is going to lose their exceptionalism us it&#39;s going to do great I think what&#39;s going to happen is what happened under Trump 1.0 which is that the middle and lower class are going to improve more than the upper class under Trump uh second term so the stock market returns will be more subdued in the US they will dramatically outperform in international uh and they will dramatically outperform for stock Pickers buying those stocks that do well when Trump is in office and avoiding those stocks that have already done well in the rear viw mirror\n\nt fablous chip designer by Revenue would be an enormous vote of confidence in Intel&#39;s Foundry business the rumor makes sense uh the two are compelling reasons why Nvidia may be keen on shifting some production away from tsmc to Intel first the company is struggling to provide enough gaming gpus to meet demand Nvidia recently launched its RTX 50 Series graphic cards but supply has been extremely tight leading to prices well above MSRP Nvidia makes a lot more money selling data center gpus aimed at AI workloads than it does from gaming gpus so it makes sense that AI chips would be the priority Nvidia only has so much manufacturing capacity at tsmc and the company would be leaving money on the table if it didn&#39;t go all out to meet soaring demand for AI accelerators if Nvidia were to shift gaming GPU production to Intel while leaving AI chip production at tsmc the company would likely have an easier time meeting demand for both products the longer it takes Nvidia to meet demand from Gamers the more likely it becomes that those Gamers give up and move over to gpus from AMD amd&#39;s latest RX 9000 graphics cards are impressive and Nvidia may be losing market share thanks to a rough Supply situation so Nvidia Intel is the only game in town to solve their problem uh they can make them an offer they can&#39;t refuse crown castle fires CEO after selling business segments that&#39;s good news not bad news they&#39;ve now got money to buy back stocks pay down debt and that&#39;s why the stock is going up can Healthcare stocks keep outperforming the market we know the answer to that because we were the only ones telling you to buy Healthcare and materials uh which were the worst performers in 2024 into 2025 they would be the best and that&#39;s exactly what we&#39;ve seen in healthcare and materials will soon follow \n### HEADLINES_AND_NEWS\narticle of the week real quick uh this is one definitely want to read at hedge fund tips.com it&#39;s funny it&#39;s uh called times they are a change in stock market and sentiment results  I had a client and friend call and say I didn&#39;t know you were into Bob Dylan and I said neither did I what are you talking about and they&#39;re like your article uh uh has a Bob Dylan reference in it I said oh yeah yeah yeah so kudos to Jeff for pulling that together uh all I care about is the content not the style and the content is phenomenal he&#39;s talking about the Boeing update and all the turnarounds that Kelly um ortberg has brought to bear and how sentiment is starting to shift from pessimism to optimism and from losses to wins and you want to go through this Q&A word for word because when you see what&#39;s happening you&#39;re going to realize why we&#39;ve been pounding the table on Boeing for so long uh whether it was at 138 or 1 this thing is just getting started uh and free cash flow is now starting to gush in 2025 and it will be getting back to as Kelly ortberg said previous levels in 2018 when the stock was $400 revenues were 101 billion earnings per share 17.85% of reading that uh and all the work that goes into that so that&#39;s that \n### MISCELLANEOUS\nquick congratulations to all the new clients that came in last year and uh first quarter of this year you could not be better positioned well you&#39;ve already seen it already this year uh and that&#39;s just beginning for what we believe will continue to be a highly rewarding year in 2025 this view is based on what has already taken place in 2025 as well as well as much of the data we&#39;ve shared in recent weeks on our podcast video cast coupled with our proprietary methods of expressing and executing upon those views on your behalf we will reopen to smaller accounts $1 million plus again uh starting April 1st but as we said for those of you listen to the podcast uh you could start to inquire in the last week or two uh and you can continue to do that which gave a lot of people a jump start so kudos to them congratulations to all of you I had the pleasure to speaking with and onboarding last week when we opened up the queue for inquiry C of you have already had your applications approved by IB so that we can begin deploying capital on your half your behalf imminently uh to see if you qualify and take advantage of this opening click here that&#39;s at hedge fund tips.com larger accounts the five and10 million accounts you&#39;re not limited to the once a quarter openings you can come on anytime you want uh but for the reasons that we discussed in this call you can kind of see that you can wait but the opportunity set&#39;s going to be a little bit different uh there will always be things to do there will be things that are down and out that we can take advantage of but um uh it&#39;s it&#39;s been beautiful getting money to work after this once in a 100 Year event created such unique opportunities in the market for sure uh and they can access bespoke service at their preference so the $1 million counts if you&#39;re coming in this quarter you want to get in the queue now so we can get you approved get you funded and take advantage uh the five And1 million accounts you want to get in now not because it&#39;s the opening you guys can come in whenever you want but because of the opportunity set in r view uh opinion not advice C terms healthc care earnings top 30 weights in the last 60 days earnings estimates have come down modestly that&#39;s a function of sandbagger season they take earnings estimates down every single quarter uh in the first every single year in the first quarter and then they build them back up financials are actually flat to up this year down 25 basis points next year up 95 basis points economic [Music] data uh nothing huge here that we need to spend a lot of time on estimates probably again right around 271 so they were at 275 came down to 271 uh that&#39;s normal these will start to come up and they haven&#39;t taken down 2026 so it&#39;s still backend loaded as always",
    "FEATURED_COMPANY_DEEP_DIVES": "\n\nhere are a bunch of charts that we've uh some names that we've discussed over time and what's so exciting and beautiful as we go through these is there you know the the window has closed there's no question that this once in a 100e opportunity to put money to work is getting narrower and narrower as a lot of our names have taken off but there are still such beautiful generational and when I say generational some of these are once in 20 years but a lot of them are once in 10 or 15 years uh and that's a lot of time to get you know to be able to buy it at such amazing prices and get doubles triples quadruples over the next handful of years and that that Windows pretty much closing so um I want to congratulate all the uh people who've come in the last just week and a half Alone um and um and many of you have already been approved by interactive brokers I don't know what they're doing over there but they've got their act together and you know these applications are getting approved in uh you know day or two versus a week which is exciting and funded so we're going to get get money to work now get money to work after uh April 2nd and and rock and roll so but you can see I mean yes Baba a lot of people miss that I mean it's going a lot higher there's no question about it but you know we're now up 120% off the lows so um you know hopefully for those of you who don't have enough exposure if you're lucky you'll get you know High 120s to get back in maybe mid10 but don't hold your breath this thing the train has left the station we told you that would be happening that's already happened all these other names that you guys are pessimistic on they're next so if you thought this was a surprise which you shouldn't think it's a damn surprise because we spent two years telling you what was going to happen uh just wait till you see the next batch and what's going to take place and it's so funny I had some new clients like I've been listening to you for over a year I thought I knew how you invested I had no idea I'm looking at the portfolio he's like I would have never figured this out I was like well you know what else do you want me to tell you uh you know that that the you're a client now it's a different game so uh anyway so Baxter um you know again this is a defensive stock they take a you know year year and a half two years to base every cycle here we are and then it just goes straight up and it recaptures new highs why because it has a moat the IV business it's the switching costs are high their pumps are fantastic and they got rid of the lowquality business the low growth business called the kidney business and you can't give it away and that's what happens right before they go to the room now today on Cooper standard everyone's nervous about the tariffs I I pray to God we get a 15 handle because I really didn't want to put new clients in this thing at 17 bucks even though it's going a lot higher over the next few years uh so I pray to God we get some serious fear in the next week and I can get a 154 handle on this and do one final absolute load the boat but I don't think we're going to get it so we'll see uh Disney uh Disney I like here I I would put new money to work but um uh you know this is going to take a few years and it's going to work its way back to New highs and Beyond uh PayPal uh or gen rather so look you bought in the 90s wrote up to to 195 that's great this is the beginning this is the next phase this is what it does so if you look back to 2016 same exact thing you know you get this Panic selloff Fountain double check then you rally up everyone gets excited gets in at 195 you smoke them out you drop 33% and then you just start to move up to the next major major move so 3 years from now this thing's going to be a ton higher uh a lot of people probably got knocked out here I would put new money to work here for sure um and probably will Intel lip bhan we're going to cover some of that today this is going to be fantastic that's all I can tell you uh small caps final breather before the move higher um Banks I think we're going to get another rally here we'll probably lay off on the next rally PayPal same exact story you come out of these lows you get the check backs scare everyone out and then you take your next leg higher this time just like we saw with Baba by the way this this is this is standard Fair ladies and gentlemen because you just get the dumb money that come in right after you have the massive rallies then you take them all out and then you take the next huge leg up and then they'll buy up here at 160 take it back to 140 before you let them off the bus and then you go straight to 200 plus and that's the way the game works so um all right where were we PayPal this is a home run uh this this I'm putting new money to work for sure uh Stanley Black and&amp; Decker this is the most leveraged play on the housing recovery which I'm going to tell you why is coming to a theater near you very quickly I love this play um bonds double head and shoulders bottom here started to Rally beginning of the year we'll consolid a little bit they're going to continue to rally for the foreseeable future which helps all of our thesis whether it be at home builders and uh we talked about last year with last week with what Scott Besson is doing on the um Capital charges for banks removing some of those restrictions uh is going to lower the 10 year by another 30 basis points takes it on three takes 10e mortgages under six and you have not seen anything like a housing boom of what you're going to see over the next five years in terms of Supply so what how do we want to play that again do we want you know just like the pent up demand in cars do we want to be the one fighting the war where these car companies oems are going to be fighting against each other for share and discounting and offering incentives no we want to be the Arms Dealer like Cooper standard selling a ceiling as they as they lower prices and volumes go through the roof with a 13 and a half year uh average car on the road let them kill each other overprice we're going to sell them the the weapons which is which is the ceiling and the fluid transfer systems and we're we get paid on volumes it's going to be the same with the housing the home builders um are going to be producing tons and tons and tons of houses with all the new land available to build and uh the ones that are going to benefit are going to be the um uh homeb Building Supplies Distributors and those type of businesses like qxo with Brad Jacobs which we own and uh had had an opportunity to be able to participate in the early days that is one that you just buy and you wake up in eight years and you've got a seven to 10 bagger I mean that's how Brad Jacob rolls and uh the guy's a winner he knows how how to do a creative Acquisitions he knows how to add technology value ad to drive profits synergies and then he knows how to play the multiple Arbitrage games so yes he paid up for Beacon but you can you can be sure tucks and um um Acquisitions in a fragmented Market he's going to be able to buy at lower multiples and get the public market multiple um Arbitrage and it's going to be fantastic so excited for that VF Corp same exact story every single cycle rallies off the lows checks back takes everyone off the bus and then goes back on to new highs same thing here rallies makes everyone doubt it and then back to to new highs so it takes a little while to consolidate and Brad uh Brack and Daryl's going to take this thing back up to new highs and it's going to be you know a handful of years but off of a 13 $15 basis you're going to wind up with a seven bagger so I mean you know uh or you can just switch to the next shiny object and keep missing great opportunities uh biotech same thing every cycle you get this bottoming another fake out like we had last year then you rally up fake them one last time and then you another parabolic move so 130 140 would not surprise me in a reasonable amount of time okay chart of the week let's see where we are I thought this was going to be a short one because we had them by the way if you missed the amazing interview with Jeff Edwards CEO of Cooper standard last week be sure to check in either at our YouTube station just go to YouTube and enter hedge fund tips uh or uh hedge fund tips with Tom Hayes podcast episode 283 was phenomenal so let's talk about CTA uh positioning in US equities they got this low in the hole in 2022 they got this low in uh the covid lows when we were pounding the table to buy uh in Fall of 2023 all of these were great buying opportunities they're down at these levels now that's the reason we've been talking this is very interesting the road from Plaza the Plaza to Mar Lago the dollars approaching valuations hit in 1985 this is super important because uh this was Reagan's second term first year of second term just like it's Trump first year of second term uh dollar was weak they wanted they excuse me the dollar was record strong they wanted it weak and they met at the plaza it was named after the Plaza Hotel in New York City um which uh I think oddly enough I don't know if Trump owned it at that time that's kind of funny I think he owned it at that time uh anyway they came to an agreement between France West Germany Japan United Kingdom the United States to depreciate the US dollar in relationship to the Frank the Deutsch Mark the Yen and the British pound sterling by intervening in currency markets the dollar depreciated significantly from the time of the agreement until it was replaced by the Lou Ray Accord the Lou Accord in 1987 uh some commentators believe the plaza Accord continued to contributed to let me highlight this so you guys don't miss it contributed to the Japanese asset price bubble of the late 1980s ladies and gentlemen I'm going to step out on a limb here and say if there there are Rumblings about a Mara Lago Accord okay and t",
    "HEADLINES_AND_NEWS": "\n\nTrump has shown his hand that he wants a weaker dollar to give us an advantage with trade with paying off the debt with everything else that comes down to it if they were to negotiate a maral Lago Accord and depreciate the US dollar this would not contribute to a Japanese asset price bubble over the next four years this would contribute to a Chinese asset price bubble of the late 20 22s and I think that all of the pieces of the puzzle are coming together that this would not surprise me at all and I think this could be the fuel for the last parabolic move in China before they come to two three lost decades like the Japanese have due to demographic miscalculations that cannot be Unwound in the next decade plus so um and and and that would certainly cause the marginal bid in using US housing certainly in areas like Orange County to evaporate um and cause a major air pocket because if everything is going up around them they&#39;re not going to pay the friction uh and the risk of getting additional money out of the country they&#39;ll keep what they got out of China here uh because it&#39;s so hard to get it out but when you&#39;ve got more opportunity domestically and you got friction to get money out to to a place where the opportunities are not as good in the short term uh all you have to do is look at people&#39;s incentives and you know how they&#39;re going to act but um this is setting up very very similarly so keep an eye on the mara logo Accord moving forward jackma backed ant TOS touts AI breakthrough using Chinese Chips uh jackma used ant group jackma backed ant Group Company used chinese-made semiconductors to develop techniques for AI training models that would cut cost by 20% according to people familiar with the matter an used domestic chips including from affiliate Alibaba Holding Group and Huawei to train models using the so-called mixture of experts machine learning approach the people said it got results similar to those from Nvidia Corp chips like the h800 they said asking not to be named as the information isn&#39;t public ladies and gentlemen necessity is the mother of invention that is big news Alibaba stocks gains its AI chips could be gaining Traction in China China adviser urges boosting consumption to 70% of GDP by 2035 uh they want to be like the us and what is the biggest toll taker of Chinese consumption for the middle and up upper class it&#39;s called Alibaba tbell t-all Etc and we are poised to benefit from that Alibaba launches new open- source AI model for cost effective AI agents Chinese consumer company signal spending is picking up again forget the mag 7 the terrific 10 are the tech bet for 2025 what are the notice the author is different when we&#39;re talking about China these days uh the terrific 10 or Alibaba 10cent mwan Z AI JD nety ba byd G Le and smic China is back as Goldman and Morgan Stanley rush to rate with appetite at post 2021 High uh you can&#39;t make this stuff up ladies and gentlemen after 100% rally opinion follows Trend and they get to be right for the next year to two years as this thing goes parabolic they&#39;ll get super duper excited when it&#39;s near its top and we will be laying off into their upgrades you us at just as we were buying into their downgrades us adds export restrictions to more Chinese Tech firms over security concerns just make them more for they&#39;re we&#39;re forcing them to do business away from us uh and to learn how to do it themselves and they&#39;ve done it a lot sooner than we could have imagined if we we had kept them dependent on our chips uh they would be a decade behind as we look out but they are it is what it is CH uh Trump Aly Ally visits Beijing to pave way for X Summit so Trump and X are going to meet uh Intel CEO lip Buu tan completes $25 million stock by and here&#39;s the beauty of it ladies and gentlemen he paid $25 million for 1 million 43,46 shares on March 26 the price per share was $23.96 most of you have basy well better than the CEO of the company and you probably still have a very limited window to lock that in talk about aligned interest with a partner super exciting news Bank of America mortgage applications jumped 80% in q1 says the executive which is kind of interesting when you think about consumer sentiment was in the gutter Etc but you had a few weeks there where mortgage rates came down wait till they drop below six and this thing goes all in this is what I&#39;m talking about Trump moves forward with plans to use federal land to build affordable housing so Nationwide the federal government owns about 1 million square miles of land or about 27% of the country&#39;s total land area the new initiative will focus on the roughly 500 million Acres managed by the department of the interior which oversees National Park Parks and Wildlife refugees so you will get not only a beautiful 1800 squ foot home by KB Homes but an endangered elk in your backyard free of charge all right uh joking not joking so um so here&#39;s the deal this announ this announcement follows a recent report from realor.com which found that the industry has a housing Supply gap of at least $3.8 million units at the current pace of construction it would take more than seven years for Supply to catch up with demand um in the joint oped in the Wall Street Journal bergam and Turner said that the inter agency task force would work to reduce red tape associated with building on Federal Land and cut through the bureaucracy to Spur new Housing Development so what they&#39;re basically saying is that we&#39;ve had so much trouble in municipalities because people don&#39;t want crowding in their own backyard that we&#39;re going to just open up this land and build there&#39;s another aspect because they really struggle in the suburbs more than they do in the cities people don&#39;t move into the cities because they want to be by themselves they move into the city because they want proximity they want people around them Etc there&#39;s another thing that they&#39;re going to do with some of the tax credits in the cities to force the local uh politicians to to cut the red tape so I think you&#39;re going to get greater density in the cities and I think you&#39;re going to get greater density in the excerts uh where these Federal lands are where they can build massive amounts of houses now that a lot of people can work hybrid and and that type of thing and businesses will pop up just like they did in the suburbs uh in the 80s so uh we will open up portions of federal land for large large scale housing construction these zones will be ultra low tax ultra low regulation we are going to open our country to building homes inexpensively young people uh and other people can buy homes so two things are going to happen one you get the Chinese marginal buyer in the expensive areas evaporating because there&#39;s more opportunities in the short term in China to make more money in a shorter amount of time number two you&#39;re going to get the opening of the federal land 500 million acres to build these 3.8 million um and number three is we&#39;re going to get to in just a minute is basically here the City Journal piece from Christ Christopher Elmendorf and Alex arich and he said uh Trump ordered uh his departments on day one to deliver emergency price relief including action to lower the cost of housing and expand the housing Supply so what they&#39;re proposing is how housing is too expensive because its development is overregulation yet the regulations that drive up housing costs Arcane local zoning and building codes are not the kinds that Congressional Republicans are best to fight however many of the local codes protect Suburban single family home neighborhoods and a residential ideal that Trump has pointedly defended in a new paper we suggest one way out of this dilemma Target big expensive cities for housing growth while letting States decide for themselves what to do about the suburbs specifically we propose to reallocate Federal affordable housing tax credits A roughly $15 billion subsidy away from the nation&#39;s biggest most expensive cities unless they adopt a basic set of pro housing reform specifically to retain their eligibility for the federal affordable housing subsidy these cities would have to allow development of apartment and condo buildings along major corridors and in commercial areas cap development fees at $10,000 per new unit roughly the national average wave provide waivers from Price controls that render a project infeasible and approve projects that conform to applicable standards ministerially that is without discre discretionary reviews and Associated conditions of approval that may change a Project&#39;s design or increase its cost Congress should also task a federal agency with developing criteria for measuring City&#39;s housing performance such as housing stock growth relative to potential growth given prices and partial characteristics persistently poor performers should lose their eligibility for federal subsidies regardless of whether they have opted into the Federal Pro housing reforms our proposal is Bud budget neutral and State neutral this is important if a city like New York chooses not to relax its regulations the tax credits it foregoes would flow to affordable housing projects elsewhere in the state the new agency uh the new policy would put significant pressure on Big City governments to develop pro- housing reforms since Progressive City Council Members won&#39;t want to be seen forfeiting affordable housing funds the suburbs would be unaffected however as the new policy would apply only to big expensive cities so you basically bracket it the suburbs where everyone&#39;s nimi not in my backyard let them let them have what they want you&#39;ve got 500 million of federal lands that&#39;s going to be all in massive production and then now you force the cities into it which um really really could be effective and that&#39;s how I think we get a renewed affordability and housing in a Rel relatively short period of time so again we&#39;ve got to find some ways to play the arms dealers and I think the number one company to start with and I and and I&#39;ve got a lot more on on my radar is going to be qxo okay which we have a nice position from lower levels and we are going to uh hopefully be able to use any opportunities to get more and set and forget for a long time because he&#39;s he&#39;s going to be in the game in a major way and an effective way so these are the Articles you can see here this shows where all the federal land is yellow is Bureau of Land Management it&#39;s mostly in the west um Bureau of Indian Affairs Department of Defense fish and wildlife Service Forest Service etc etc etc so this is where you&#39;re going to see huge amounts of construction in the west sales incentives on home deliveries as a percentage of Revenue the they&#39;re going to continue to produce and build they just don&#39;t know it yet uh it&#39;s going to be a race to the bottom for their margins and uh the building supply companies are going to make fortunes uh supplying the arms to the Battlers which are going to be the uh KB Homes the lenars ETC they&#39;ll make money don&#39;t get me wrong they&#39;re going to benefit from this as well but I want to be on the other side of it Japan inflation slows but the uptrend backs the case for raid hikes we&#39;ve said this over and over as a matter of fact we posted on Twitter um it&#39;s kind of funny yesterday they were all saying that oh the Tariff the markets down because of the tariffs and if you actually looked at the stock market it was kind of funny I had to post this and I don&#39;t like commenting day-to-day must be about the auto tariffs meanwhile the only stocks that were down were the mag 7 everything else in the market was up and and every single journalist uh on TV was saying it was the auto tariffs this is all Trump&#39;s fault and these were the stocks that were down what was going on the Japanese 10-year jgb yield was going to 20y year high high and what we&#39;ve talked about regularly for the last 6 months is to watch the unwind of the carry trade as the cost-free money starts to have a cost uh all the leverage that was embedded in the carry trade you you shorting Yen get free currency to then put into the most crowded trades which is mag 7 is unwinding and that is the day but here&#39;s year to date what&#39;s down only the mag s so like people keep asking me when&#39;s this going to stop I was like when&#39;s what going to stop we&#39;re up I mean this has been an unbelievable year so uh and and this is where most people are stuck the passive indexers are getting slammed because they&#39;re overweight in all these names that have been hit the hardest and they don&#39;t realize has nothing to do with tariffs has nothing to do with customer sentiment has to do with the unwind of Leverage that was embedded in the carry trade so as the Japanese inflation uh continues to pick up uh they will have to raise carry trade on wines all that hot money comes out of the hottest uh most crowd trades and you see more of this I think we&#39;re probably through another phase of this and these are going to get a bounce but uh every day when you see the market down just go look at uh 10year jgbs and that&#39;ll tell you the answer and all the commentators can you know blame policies that are unrelated to the stocks that are actually down Jack ma backed an TOS a touts AI breakthrough using Chinese Chips Alibaba stock oh we&#39;re okay here we go we got so much to cover I thought this was going to be an easy one today ladies and gentlemen we got a lot to cover here uh so this is kind of what&#39;s happening with cars smaller cars and smaller houses are going to be the name of the game for the next five years which is going to lead to massive volumes which is going to help Cooper standard which is a OEM supplier and um the building suppliers which are OEM suppliers I guess I guess lenar and KB and toll are considered oems in the housing business uh so what you&#39;re seeing is some of the mid the compact SUVs are going up subc compact the compact cars midsize trucks uh and everything going down fixed housing affordability index housing has not been this unaffordable since 20062 7 so how does that got res resolved uh last time it was through deleveraging and helocs coming due and a big crash this time it&#39;s going to be more and more options becoming available and once you have a massive supply of options um prices come down and you&#39;re going to see the same thing for labor as well I ran an ad for a personal assistant I I can&#39;t even tell you I need an assistant to go through all the applications I got for an assistant I mean you can&#39;t make this stuff up um it&#39;s staggering now so the the shift is so so what I&#39;m saying is wage inflation is com coming down which we all know uh why because there&#39;s a greater supply of labor than demand for labor right now and the same is going to happen as the supply picks up on Federal Land and in cities through the coercion tactics that I discussed uh and this will finish now National home prices change I am a master of patterns and I can tell you this pattern is pretty obvious ladies and gentlemen\n\nhere is the 10-year jgb you can see what&#39;s happening with these yields you can see why the current why the carry trade is unwinding\n### HEADLINES_AND_NEWS\nHere Is Us sales for each OEM by origin of production so we&#39;ll see how this shakes out but as Jeff Edwards said on the

scale up and fill that capacity with new customer orders according to UBS analyst Timothy arcury Intel is closing in on scoring Nvidia as a Foundry cust customer while Intel has both Microsoft and Amazon on board as Intel 18a customers winning over the largest fablous chip designer by Revenue would be an enormous vote of confidence in Intel&#39;s Foundry business the rumor makes sense uh the two are compelling reasons why Nvidia may be keen on shifting some production away from tsmc to Intel first the company is struggling to provide enough gaming gpus to meet demand Nvidia recently launched its RTX 50 Series graphic cards but supply has been extremely tight leading to prices well above MSRP Nvidia makes a lot more money selling data center gpus aimed at AI workloads than it does from gaming gpus so it makes sense that AI chips would be the priority Nvidia only has so much manufacturing capacity at tsmc and the company would be leaving money on the table if it didn&#39;t go all out to meet soaring demand for AI accelerators if Nvidia were to shift gaming GPU production to Intel while leaving AI chip production at tsmc the company would likely have an easier time meeting demand for both products the longer it takes Nvidia to meet demand from Gamers the more likely it becomes that those Gamers give up and move over to gpus from AMD amd&#39;s latest RX 9000 graphics

HEADLINES_AND_NEWS\narticle of the week real quick uh this is one definitely want to read at hedge fund tips.com it&#39;s funny it&#39;s uh called times they are a change in stock market and sentiment results  I had a client and friend call and say I didn&#39;t know you were into Bob Dylan and I said neither did I what are you talking about and they&#39;re like your article uh uh has a Bob Dylan reference in it I said oh yeah yeah yeah so kudos to Jeff for pulling that together uh all I care about is the content not the style and the content is phenomenal he&#39;s talking about the Boeing update and all the turnarounds that Kelly um ortberg has brought to bear and how sentiment is starting to shift from pessimism to optimism and from losses to wins and you want to go through this Q&A word for word because when you see what&#39;s happening you&#39;re going to realize why we&#39;ve been pounding the table on Boeing for so long uh whether it was at 138 or 1 this thing is just getting started uh and free cash flow is now starting to gush in 2025 and it will be getting back to as Kelly ortberg said previous levels in 2018 when the stock was $400 revenues were 101 billion earnings per share 17.85% of reading that uh and all the work that goes into that so that&#39;s that \n### MISCELLANEOUS\nquick congratulations to all the new clients that came in last year and uh first quarter of this year you could not be better positioned well you&#39;ve already seen it already this year uh and that&#39;s just beginning for what we believe will continue to be a highly rewarding year in 2025 this view is based on what has already taken place in 2025 as well as well as much of the data we&#39;ve shared in recent weeks on our podcast video cast coupled with our proprietary methods of expressing and executing upon those views on your behalf we will reopen to smaller accounts $1 million plus again uh starting April 1st but as we said for those of you listen to the podcast uh you could start to inquire in the last week or two uh and you can continue to do that which gave a lot of people a jump start so kudos to them congratulations to all of you I had the pleasure to speaking with and onboarding last week when we opened up the queue for inquiry C of you have already had your applications approved by IB so that we can begin deploying capital on your half your behalf imminently uh to see if you qualify and take advantage of this opening click here that&#39;s at hedge fund tips.com larger accounts the five and10 million accounts you&#39;re not limited to the once a quarter openings you can come on anytime you want uh but for the reasons that we discussed in this call you can kind of see that you can wait but the opportunity set&#39;s going to be a little bit different uh there will always be things to do there will be things that are down and out that we can take advantage of but um uh it&#39;s it&#39;s been beautiful getting money to work after this once in a 100 Year event created such unique opportunities in the market for sure uh and they can access bespoke service at their preference so the $1 million counts if you&#39;re coming in this quarter you want to get in the queue now so we can get you approved get you funded and take advantage uh the five And1 million accounts you want to get in now not because it&#39;s the opening you guys can come in whenever you want but because of the opportunity set in r view uh opinion not advice C terms healthc care earnings top 30 weights in the last 60 days earnings estimates have come down modestly that&#39;s a function of sandbagger season they take earnings estimates down every single quarter uh in the first every single year in the first quarter and then they build them back up financials are actually flat to up this year down 25 basis points next year up 95 basis points economic [Music] data uh nothing huge here that we need to spend a lot of time on estimates probably again right around 271 so they were at 275 came down to 271 uh that&#39;s normal these will start to come up and they haven&#39;t taken down 2026 so it&#39;s still backend loaded as always",
    "MACRO_DATA_SLIDES": "\n\n### MACRO_DATA_SLIDES\nnot none seen like this since the 202 2006 Peak um this is and this is only showing to 2022 uh I you know it&#39;s funny I look at Tik Tok and I see all these Trends in 2022 you literally couldn&#39;t get to your feed every single person was every schmock was making a fortune in real estate and selling courses on how to make money in real estate etc etc etc and um that&#39;s what you see in in extreme so uh us median housing payment as a percentage of median income again highest since 2006 again not calling for that type of Crash but I think the early 90s is a really really good parallel in terms of housing prices uh declining and disruption in the housing market price-wise not supply wise uh while the economy and the stock market does well and international stocks do extremely well uh United States 57% affordability Gap income needed to buy versus actual so this is all from Charlie Bello uh you can see some of these major cities starting to come down Tampa or grow at slower Paces I think you&#39;re going to see more of those hit the list uh increase over the last five years average hourly earnings have grown 25% us home prices have grown 53% these will converge i a mean reversion guy us home price growth by decade uh so I mean this is mindboggling so real annualized the highest decade was 40 through 49 followed by 2010 to 2019 and 2020 to 2024 is double the highest basically at 4.6 the average for the last 133 years has been half a percent per year real uh part of the reason for that is the American homes have doubled in size so uh this is another theme I think we&#39;re going to be going to massive increase in volume of cars and houses a massive reduction in size in both cars and houses because we&#39;re meeting the needs of the people who need it which is our people starting families uh not people in their you know mid to late 40s early 50s who want to upgrade to the big house to you know be the biggest on the Block uh Etc so uh that&#39;ll be the next phase\n### MISCELLANEOUS\nmoving along  all bare markets start with a correction but not all Corrections turn into a bear I think that is the case this time that&#39;s Ryan Dietrich stuff over at Carson uh investor allocation equities at an all-time high uh that&#39;s why you had to have some give back here in the first quarter um and continued under performance for mag 7 even if they technically Bounce from here which they probably will Market funds now at 10 trillion so t\n\nis is an S&amp;P chart so we see this correction here and then a rally and then check back you know like a lot of stocks rally checkback here&#39;s the checkback that we&#39;re going through right now so this this looks pretty uh pretty regular conference board one-ear expectation of stock prices has collapsed biggest decline ever in 40 years the other big declines were co uh covid lows 2002 so that&#39;s an interesting stat from fun Strat May soon lose its uh us may soon lose its Global stock market leadership Crown we&#39;ve been talking about that and preparing for a while it&#39;s not because us is going to lose their exceptionalism us it&#39;s going to do great I think what&#39;s going to happen is what happened under Trump 1.0 which is that the middle and lower class are going to improve more than the upper class under Trump uh second term so the stock market returns will be more subdued in the US they will dramatically outperform in international uh and they will dramatically outperform for stock Pickers buying those stocks that do well when Trump is in office and avoiding those stocks that have already done well in the rear viw mirror uh and we we do concur here&#39;s another situation here to looking at the trade weighted dollar Index I really like this chart because it talks about when the dollar weakens these different regimes regime one dollar weekend you had us uh you had International outperformance then the dollar strengthened in Reagan&#39;s first term weakened in the second term that was the plaza Accord Peak that we talked about then you had dramatic International equity outperformance and what they&#39;re talking about here uh you can see you know International equities during that period up 17% then you see regime five the dollar weaken from 20032 2003 to 2009 you had uh dramatic uh International outperformance 14% compounded per year versus 5% of us then you had the dollar strengthening follow following 2009 and it what they&#39;re talking about here is  uh dollar now weakening and you&#39;re seeing the international outperform the US and these things go on for at least a handful of years um so more stuff we burden oursel with the facts let&#39;s see here okay from Sarah eyes and here&#39;s the chart on the global imbalance that the Trump Administration is trying to adjust us makes up 29% of global consumption but only 15% of global manufacturing China makes up 12% of global consumer spending and 32% of global manufacturing we have lost a m lot of manufacturing share to China well guess what China wants to increase their share of global consumer spending while we want to increase our share of global manufacturing so maybe there&#39;s a deal to be done there and it comes with a reset and a reval of the US dollar to make us more competitive globally they get what they want we get what we want and uh it that how&#39;s that for reciprocal uh so the meeting is imminent us durable goods orders uh motor vehicles and parts are up front loading ahead of tariffs boost us durable goods orders so a lot of front row uh loaded production should help Cooper standard in q1 which is pretty exciting and uh Jeff Edwards alluded to as much on the uh interview we did last week growth expectations us has peaked while the Euro area is too low according to mrb Partners\n\n### HEADLINES_AND_NEWS\nHere Is Us sales for each OEM by origin of production so we&#39;ll see how this shakes out but as Jeff Edwards said on the earnings call the oems are going to have to take it the oems basically pushed all the part suppliers down to Mexico because they wanted to increase their margins so they&#39;re going to have to eat that if they want the supplies they need to build their cars which they&#39;re going to need because competition is coming and they don&#39;t want to lose more and more share so they&#39;re going to run incentives they&#39;re going to to run volumes in order to not to lose share which cannot be easily reversed uh magnificent 7 set for worst quarter

what outperformed uh International small cap value we&#39;re starting to see that small cap has lagged if you&#39;re if you don&#39;t have enough small cap Now&#39;s the Time in our opinion we&#39;ve raised our Euro area GDP forecast by 1% opinion follows Trend Europe is outperformed so now all the strategists are catching up uh Market implied fed funds rate so anticipating 369 by the end of the year energy consolidating Market is approaching key Crossroads what do we have here okay one of the sharpest draw Downs whether you get a recession or not and the outcome I think this is Son&#39;s recession which means we&#39;re going to recover Into Summer uh next year will be a bit choppier which will create more opportunities we&#39;ll probably be harvesting I I would think we&#39;re going to probably be harvesting about a third of our positions by the end of this year uh or maybe first quarter next year raise a bunch of cash and then next year gets choppy a mid midterm year which and we&#39;ll be able to put a lot of that cash and we&#39;ll probably be able to start the year with some nice uh put spreads across different sectors and companies make some money on the downside and then redeploy for the next five years uh and uh and have an awesome time large deals announced since 2018 so um that&#39;s that that&#39;s been anemic that&#39;s going to come back quickly inflow into Chinese security Rises to record high opinion follows Trend growth impact of credit impulse in China just beginning ladies and gentlemen no one&#39;s been paying attention for the last three quarters we&#39;ve been pounding the table um upcoming upcycle in consumer credit growth lending standards for Consumer grow okay so lending standards for Consumer loans have been going down the other thing is there&#39;s a lot of equity in houses as rates come down people are going to use that as the piggy bank again like we saw almost 20 years ago that&#39;s going to be very um good for the general economy small C positioning everyone&#39;s underway this is it&#39;s it&#39;s been time to buy when newsletters sell so not only are the hedge funds selling in the whole the newsletters are all bearish that&#39;s usually what you see at bottoms this was the only failed signal in early 2022 so everyone&#39;s pulling out their 2022 charts why because of recency bias they look at the most recent experience that they&#39;ve all went through and the 10-year-old money managers uh think that&#39;s the only one so they&#39;re all looking for this to go a lot further I don&#39;t think they&#39;re going to be right in this case uh US dollar and equities rarely fall sharply in tandem for long stretches um S&amp;P US dollar Index last time it happened was 20202 again another parallel we&#39;ve always talked about 20012 2002 which was the time to position where International small cap value everything no one wants and now they&#39;re starting to want it after they&#39;re up a lot but the game is actually just beginning uh asset return expectations oh that&#39;s funny everyone expects Japan to have the highest returns I think the opposite is going to be true uh speculators turned short dollar first time since October so opinion is following Trend as the dollars weakened that can be the beginning of a very long weakening Cycle Plaza Accord style Mar Lago Accord style S&amp;P returns following large declines in US sentiment indicator uh we covered this you know six and 12 months out you&#39;re up double digits if there&#39;s no recession we believe that is going to be the case this year [Music] do boom was way more extreme I think this is kind of interesting here showing the parallel a lot of people use analogs um but we could be in the early 90s stage which was all which would also be very interesting so it&#39;s something to put it in perspective when everyone says we&#39;re going to crash I I think you&#39;re going to see those bounce now not the only game in town International starting to outperform Country composition of the msci all country World index we&#39;ve covered before uh us United States is 64% of the weight it&#39;s not 64% of the earnings power so expect these weights to start to of course they were taking down China exposure just as the earnings start to accelerate so this three just this reminds me a lot of um actually go back and listen to the podcast in 2020 during covid I think the energy sector had gotten down to 2% of the waiting of the S&amp;P 500 down from like 10% and I said this is not sustainable um and and if you remember they were basically threatening pensions and money managers if you invested in energy uh you&#39;d be cancelled effectively and so no one would do it and I said look at the end of the day people want their lights on so it&#39;s a question how much pain they&#39;re going to take before they all flip and that&#39;s exactly what happened the same thing is going to happen with China now uh you&#39;ve dramatically underperformed this year if you had no International exposure uh if you were overweight International you are doing extremely well and smiling so wide you could eat a banana sideways uh so um uh so that&#39;s that and so expect these weights to go up this weight to come down policy uncertainty waiting on us exceptionalism okay again these are people looking at policy when they should be looking at the 10-year jgb S&amp;P performance has historically Reborn rebounded well following Corrections so this is from Capital markets actually shows greater returns than we were talking about but the key is 12 months out double digit returns if no recession we are in that camp double digit returns off the low which could mean again what we had anticipated for the year high single digits overall year returns for the passive indexers in the S&amp;P 500 which means S&amp;P 500 under performs which means stock Pickers win the day uh who are good at it China consumption picks up at year start in line with thesis uh Euro USD reduct the significance of whatever it takes euro is starting to Rally no one&#39;s paying attention I also love the the bo the rally in Boeing that no one&#39;s paying attention to now that&#39;s pretty exciting to me I love when stocks start to rally and people aren&#39;t paying attention because they&#39;re so they got so pessimistic at the lows it reminds me when we were talking about GE at the lows uh and you couldn&#39;t give it away uh and that thing had a monster rally with no one paying attention China&#39;s fiscal stimulus in 2025 will be the largest outside the pandemic that&#39;s big news no one&#39;s paying attention to it this would be the most pension and Target date F okay this would be the most pension and Target

think about increasing your initial underwriting intrinsic value price or is this something you determine in the beginning and don&#39;t change in order to stay grounded just curious across the board with all Investments you make do you ever reconsider intrinsic value and therefore exit price uh when additional positive information shows up yeah I&#39;ve said many times that you know we can adjust

run by a socialist kind of funny coming from a guy who&#39;s got his biggest position with a communist country but you know if you can&#39;t take a joke um I think you&#39;re going to be right with that and I think you&#39;re probably going to be right with Vietnam as well um but you know that&#39;s like if you&#39;re super right with Vietnam you make like 70 80% which is not enough for me to initiate a position like if I if I don&#39;t have at least a double I I don&#39;t even allocate Capital uh Brazil you really need that guy out hopefully sooner rather than later to get the boom but I think all International is going to do well so I don&#39;t think those would hurt you VIN sentore would love to hear your opinion on heyer Yale uh probably not yet my man what do these guys do sir Services a line of trucks attachments aftermarket parts yeah the only thing worse than car parts is truck [Music] parts I would say uh maybe ready but I think it&#39;s I don&#39;t know I honestly with this thing I would be looking at i&#39; I&#39;d probably just set an alert at like $35 and if it hit I&#39;d start doing work on it because it&#39;s just such a shitty business that it just has to be left for dead and then I have to say okay they&#39;re not going bankrupt let me see how they compete competitively it&#39;s just there&#39;s not enough margin of safety for for this quality of a business I mean at $5 with Cooper standard if they didn&#39;t go bankrupt I knew I had a triple uh and then from there as they&#39;ve improved the business I know it&#39;s going to be a lot more probably from $5 you know 15 25 times so uh Matt Mitchell uh thoughts on T at these levels high quality business two-thirds of the firm&#39;s assets held in retirement accounts stick your asset piece I don&#39;t like the business [Music] um I think you&#39;re I think you&#39;re right but I don&#39;t like this business enough to get involved I mean this is just a hope that they buy in all the stock and you own a bigger portion of the company it&#39;s probably going to be okay Matt but it&#39;s it&#39;s just it&#39;s not a great business uh Matt Jack trtnik from who knows where ah here we go longtime listener big fan of your work writing in from Slovenia I&#39;m sure you&#39;ve heard of Luca donik number 77 and your first lady to help put Slovenia on the map first let me say how much I appreciate everything you do and share with us your content is insightful educational and genuinely helpful I especially look forward to your weekly podcast my Friday mornings wouldn&#39;t would wouldn&#39;t be the same without it uh thank you for that since I started following you back in 2023 my entire view on investing has shifted currently I&#39;m managing my portfolios myself as I truly enjoy do doing that but at the same time I&#39;ve been seriously considering having my money managed professionally in the future summer my wife and family will be traveling to Cali all right whatever separate note uh curious about your take on Pitney bows this is a garbage business uh that&#39;s going to be a low price stock for a long time um and you missed it I mean if you&#39;re playing a turnaround you you you missed it um hard P hard pass uh thanks for all you do well thank you from slovania very excited when you&#39;re in California look me up and um we&#39;ll get together Jacob saxo uh last week&#39;s podcast you mentioned about Bank supplementary leverage ratio Scott bessent how significant of a removal we told you last week Jacob it&#39;s 30 basis points on the 10year tra uh Drew Robinson what are your thoughts on lft uh there&#39;s some activist involvement it&#39;s probably okay but I don&#39;t like the business y ft um next Lucas what price would you consider Nike undervalued in this range but it&#39;s going to take a longer time than most people think so the question is what&#39;s your irr five years out OA thank you so much for your product it can express how valuable your insights manag okay you&#39;re welcome thank you Oz I&#39;d love to hear your thoughts on [Music] Puma I don&#39;t know no one wears Pumas in the US other than uh that guy who uh that golfer his name slips my mind [Music] uh Puma I don&#39;t know Puma is like that that must be like a European thing no one wears that in America let me see the balance sheet I think you&#39;re probably going to be right on this one I mean I&#39;d rather buy Nike and just wait five years for it to work than and buy this thing so they&#39;ve been eroding cash let&#39;s see how much debt do they have well Deb&#39;s not bad either yeah they generate a lot of cash flow I I think you&#39;re probably okay here um certainly good good enough for a bounce that&#39;s for sure um thanks for your amazing content I&#39;m an asset manager in Columbia and Brazil reap vehicles in decreasing Patria P ax yeah you really just have to know the underlying assets and I&#39;m going to have no Edge on the buildings or whatever they own in Brazil so therefore it&#39;s a pass for me um but if you have comfort with the buildings and with the financials uh yeah it&#39;s another way to play it for sure um yeah you&#39;re probably right uh but it&#39;s not for me uh I never take company and Country risks so you know if I was going to play like you know with China I took the best most secure company when
