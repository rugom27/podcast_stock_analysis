[0.599s] welcome to hedge fun tips with Tom Hayes
[3.32s] I&#39;m Tom Hayes and this is your
[6.2s] 251st videoast podcast for the week
[8.599s] ending August 6
[10.48s] 2024 lot of great stuff to cover this
[12.92s] week and doing it a bit early because
[15.04s] I&#39;ve got to travel down to Virginia for
[18.48s] the girls zones championship and got
[21.84s] pushed back a day but we&#39;ll get there
[23.519s] first of foremost want to congratulate
[25.56s] Mimi uh we do family first then we get
[27.48s] down to business Mimi and Annabelle swam
[29.679s] the Nutmeg State games this weekend four
[32.8s] Golds and a silver for Mimi four Golds
[36.16s] for Annabelle plus two records in the 50
[39.04s] back and 100 free way to go girls
[42.559s] unbelievable and then they had their uh
[45.84s] that was me at Fox on Friday for Liz
[49.76s] Clayman we did it out of the pod that&#39;s
[51.879s] the main Bullpen I always like to show
[54.44s] people that kind of behind the scenes
[55.96s] for the new listeners like to see what
[58.44s] it looks like to be at fo
[60.48s] and this was their divisional
[62.8s] championship for the uh sumers Swim Club
[67.72s] meet I think they were down at Greenwich
[70.04s] on Monday did a great job down there and
[73.6s] I think that&#39;s all the updates for the
[75.32s] week we&#39;ll have more for you first I
[77.56s] want to thank Liz Clayman and Jake Mack
[81.04s] for having me on the Clayman countdown
[82.84s] on Friday with Nick timos the FED
[85.92s] Whisperer himself from the Wall Street
[88.72s] Journal covered a lot of important stuff
[90.64s] here including the Som rule the labor
[92.479s] report we&#39;re going to listen in now a
[95.04s] rate cut but a jumbo or super siiz rate
[98.28s] cut in September Nick timos is the Wall
[100.28s] Street journal&#39;s all things fed
[101.6s] correspondent who understands the fed&#39;s
[104.04s] thinking better than just about anybody
[105.759s] and Trader Tom Hayes has been
[107.84s] scrutinizing which stocks maybe look
[110.24s] like a Buy in this selloff and Nick I&#39;ll
[112.399s] start with you three days ago fed funds
[114.04s] Futures fully expected a September rate
[116.84s] cut of about 25 basis points right but
[118.84s] saw only a 10% odds of a larger 50 basis
[123.36s] point easing look at fed funds Futures
[126.24s] right now one ugly jobs report it
[128.28s] skyrockets to near 70% for a 50 basis
[132.08s] point cut what do you think chair Powell
[134.2s] is mulling right now and is the market
[136.239s] way ahead of itself versus what the FED
[138.239s] is
[139.879s] thinking well Liz is the market ahead of
[143.68s] itself I mean probably not but there&#39;s
[148.36s] the market is sort of assuming that the
[151.28s] current trends continue uh the FED
[153.959s] doesn&#39;t really have to make up its mind
[156.519s] for another six or seven weeks right
[158.56s] they don&#39;t meet for another seven weeks
[160.519s] so I&#39;m sure we&#39;ll hear from fed
[163.0s] officials uh you know a lot over those
[165.879s] six or seven weeks but they don&#39;t really
[168.44s] have to make up their mind now about
[171.0s] whether the first cut uh will be 25 or
[174.599s] 50 that&#39;s obviously where the debate is
[176.68s] going to be what I&#39;m hearing today from
[178.8s] a lot of analysts is okay you can do
[181.64s] 25 at every meeting there are three
[184.28s] meetings left this year and that&#39;s
[186.599s] probably locked in now as a base case
[188.76s] for the FED there are a number of people
[191.319s] though who have said you need interest
[193.56s] rates to get closer to neutral sooner
[196.56s] you need to be closer to
[198.28s] 4% by the end of this year and so you
[201.319s] saw JP Morgan and City Bank put out
[203.599s] calls uh this morning for 50 basis point
[207.04s] Cuts in September and November and
[209.319s] another quarter point in December I
[212.159s] don&#39;t think you&#39;re going to hear fed
[213.599s] officials talking about that right now
[215.959s] but the next meeting is still a ways
[218.04s] away so you know they&#39;ll have another
[220.159s] jobs report before that meeting they&#39;ll
[222.28s] have we&#39;ll be able to see a lot more uh
[225.08s] than we can
[226.64s] today June July September November of
[230.08s] 2022 you saw jumbo rate hikes so we know
[234.76s] that the FED isn&#39;t afraid of making big
[237.72s] moves of 75 basis points even
[240.4s] but the question is now will City and JP
[243.0s] Morgan be right they are both claiming
[245.28s] that September and November will see um
[248.84s] I guess a 50 basis point cut Tom uh not
[252.079s] only is there no rotation out of Mega
[254.599s] cap Tech and into the Russell the
[256.359s] Russell is getting absolutely slammed
[258.44s] biggest percentage loser here what&#39;s
[260.239s] behind the Panic selling there and if
[262.479s] there&#39;s any money leaving and going into
[264.759s] somewhere where do you think it&#39;s going
[266.96s] well the Market&#39;s afraid of two things
[268.8s] Liz first off is is a recession because
[270.72s] the S rule was triggered today that&#39;s
[273.12s] when the unemployment rate 3-month
[274.759s] moving average moves up a half a percent
[277.32s] higher than the lowest three-month
[279.28s] moving average 12 months before that&#39;s a
[281.08s] mouthful but the markets are worried
[282.759s] about a recession that&#39;s why small caps
[284.44s] are down that&#39;s why yields are down the
[286.72s] second thing that&#39;s happening is the
[288.36s] unwind of the Japanese carry trade the
[290.88s] Nik is down 20% that&#39;s a lot more than
[293.68s] the NASDAQ and that&#39;s because the bank
[295.8s] of Japan has been the global liquidity
[297.8s] provider while the West Titan to fight
[300.12s] inflation but the FED has not stepped in
[302.36s] now that the bank of Japan is tightening
[304.08s] so you have this liquidity dislocation
[306.24s] pocket and guess what&#39;s happening it&#39;s a
[308.639s] big unwinding of the most crowded trades
[311.36s] because liquidity is drying up and the
[313.0s] most crowded trade as you know was the
[315.199s] Magnificent 7 and the second most
[317.32s] crowded trade was short the Japanese Yen
[320.16s] so with yields lower what we&#39;re looking
[322.44s] at Liz is dividend payers that&#39;s where
[324.84s] the opportunity is right
[327.08s] now yeah opportunity in door Dash it&#39;s
[329.96s] up 7% we do have a little bits of green
[332.88s] on the screen here uh Nick before we go
[335.68s] here as you&#39;re looking at this Market
[337.4s] action and specifically the Panic that&#39;s
[339.319s] in the vix I mean that that&#39;s just sort
[341.319s] of a one-day situation but it does
[343.44s] measure some concern about the markets
[345.919s] do you get the sense that the FED is
[347.96s] guided At All by these market minations
[350.199s] and
[351.68s] spasms one day movs Liz no but I think
[355.039s] what what you what I&#39;m paying attention
[356.84s] to here is if this is sustained does it
[359.68s] change sentiment if you change sentiment
[362.199s] you change business&#39;s plans to invest
[365.36s] they slash investment budgets they
[367.599s] decide to fire workers uh labor demand
[370.36s] is clearly weaker than it was some
[372.24s] months ago and so what I would worry
[373.96s] about here is what if businesses have
[375.72s] been holding on to workers because they
[378.0s] work so hard to hire them you know you
[380.319s] heard about all these shortages after
[381.88s] the pandemic and so they&#39;ve been holding
[383.28s] on to them right and now like a beach
[385.44s] ball under the surface of the water if
[388.039s] they just decide at some point to let
[389.84s] people go you know that beach ball it it
[392.599s] jumps up and you you have to wonder if
[396.199s] that creates sort of the the recession
[398.56s] Dynamic that the market is worried about
[401.12s] here and this sort of feeds on itself so
[403.479s] I think that&#39;s I think that&#39;s what you
[405.039s] have to wonder about right
[406.84s] now and a lot of people will be going
[409.319s] into dividend paying stocks right Tom
[411.16s] really quickly can you give us cough up
[412.84s] a couple of names here very quickly
[415.52s] paying out dividends so people can wait
[417.36s] and kind of hang out there yes crown
[419.599s] Castle International 40,000 cell cell
[421.96s] phone towers 52% dividend yield uh
[424.8s] Baxter International medical devices and
[426.8s] supplies 3.2% dividend yield and horl
[430.599s] Foods bringing you world famous Spam at
[433.68s] a 3.5% dividend yield while you wait a
[436.52s] steady
[437.919s] grower all right uh Nick and Tom thank
[441.08s] you very much on a rocking day we are
[443.84s] about 52
[445.68s] minutes and we&#39;re back and then I had
[449.28s] the pleasure to join Charles Payne on
[452.24s] Monday to talk about the Japanese
[455.039s] currency trade Japanese carry trade
[457.879s] unwind some picks and a lot more thanks
[460.96s] to Nick Palazo and Charles for having me
[464.159s] on we&#39;re going to listen in
[467.24s] now all right so the overarching
[469.4s] rationale for the FED not the cut rates
[471.319s] is that it would Panic the markets and
[472.919s] listen I get that in most cases in life
[475.24s] you don&#39;t want to panic but I got to
[477.159s] tell you I have personally been in
[478.52s] positions and play
[480.319s] uh where those knee-jerk moves saved my
[482.28s] life right and and also times it saved
[484.4s] me financially from a lot of Heartache
[486.52s] I&#39;m going to Bringing out great Hill
[487.8s] Capital chairman uh Thomas Hayes Thomas
[489.68s] so I know you&#39;re one of those study Edy
[491.4s] guys check out your posture right just
[492.8s] cool and easy like a modern day Paul
[494.599s] Newman
[495.68s] right but uh you know it&#39;s it&#39;s like the
[499.0s] whole steady crowd doesn&#39;t want the FED
[501.24s] to overreact by the same token though
[503.639s] the markets are pushing them around
[505.12s] right and of course you have to wonder
[507.36s] how much things have changed since the
[508.52s] moves from the bank of Jaan
[509.96s] I mean the feds doesn&#39;t just have to
[512.64s] deal within the context of us but it&#39;s
[515.0s] also got other central banks around the
[516.44s] world that are making aggressive moves
[518.24s] yeah this is a big deal I think the
[519.68s] carry trade onwi is actually pretty
[521.56s] important you had the Nik drop 25% in a
[525.16s] very short amount of time basically what
[527.2s] you have is the funding currency the
[529.12s] Japanese Yen institutions were borrowing
[531.519s] that for free to buy the most crowded
[533.959s] trades the Magnificent Sev so as the
[536.519s] cost of capital went up they had to
[538.88s] return that capital and unwind the The
[541.079s] Magnificent Seven trades so it&#39;s like
[543.48s] the FED as the bank of Japan hiked had
[547.079s] the opportunity to cut to make up that
[549.72s] that ill liquidity they didn&#39;t do that
[551.959s] so where&#39;s the liquidity going to come
[553.48s] from we&#39;ve had 35 Central Bank Cuts
[556.64s] globally in the past 3 months the last
[558.959s] time we had that many Cuts was in 2020
[561.279s] April 2020 we had like 95 have we ever
[564.24s] had this sort of carry tray relationship
[565.8s] with any I mean does do we have like
[567.2s] that with the bank of Pakistan or
[568.88s] something like that you know what I mean
[570.0s] like not being I&#39;m being a little fous
[571.88s] here but I&#39;ve never heard of this sort
[573.279s] of relationship where like Japanese
[574.68s] households were buying buying our tech
[576.8s] stocks and buying our treasuries by the
[578.36s] way and who buys that now yeah so uh
[581.399s] this was pretty big in 2006 and 2007
[584.2s] when you had the lowc cost of capital
[585.76s] with the Japanese Yen it&#39;s it&#39;s reworked
[588.0s] itself I think now you&#39;ve probably going
[589.8s] to find out one or two weeks from now
[591.44s] you&#39;ve been around maybe a couple funds
[593.16s] blew up over the weekend this felt like
[595.44s] abnormal uh selling that we saw
[597.519s] structural selling which creates
[598.76s] opportunity if you have cash to deploy
[600.8s] so let&#39;s talk about that opportunity
[602.399s] right now you say we&#39;ve got a declining
[603.64s] rate environment declining US dollar and
[605.519s] there&#39;s specific areas that historically
[607.44s] really work out that&#39;s right uh first
[609.399s] and foremost dividend payers that&#39;s nice
[610.88s] in a day like today you get a little bit
[612.279s] of safety you get a little bit bit of
[613.68s] yield while you wait but with lowering
[615.399s] rates people want the yield and they&#39;re
[616.72s] going to move back from money markets
[618.36s] into dividend payers for sure cyclicals
[620.92s] we&#39;re seeing the earnings growth of the
[622.839s] UNM magnificent 493 accelerate while the
[625.079s] Magnificent 7 decelerates cuz margins
[627.0s] are compress uh compressing from the cap
[629.56s] expend then small caps started to go and
[632.2s] they just got whacked last week they&#39;ll
[634.519s] be back because the earnings growth is
[636.44s] going to go from 4% this year to 177%
[639.0s] next year even as is a little less also
[641.88s] after the first cut they outperform
[643.76s] large caps by 11% in the first 12 months
[647.0s] and then International guess which group
[649.0s] did the best in the last 5 days China
[652.399s] China was only down a few percent while
[654.519s] you know the N was down 25% would you
[656.959s] buy China specifically or would you buy
[658.639s] like I how would you go about this look
[661.519s] I&#39;ve been bagged in this stock for like
[662.88s] a year and a half I own Alibaba it&#39;s a
[665.0s] huge company a huge out the cheapest AI
[667.639s] play in the world it&#39;s done nothing for
[669.24s] a year and a half I think this is ready
[670.48s] to roll they&#39;re going to report on
[671.959s] August 15th so I like the environment
[674.6s] with a weaker dollar with rates coming
[676.079s] down and with the hot money coming out
[678.079s] of Japan and back into China could be an
[681.16s] opportunity uh we&#39;ve got a minute to go
[683.56s] enough time to go over some of your def
[685.16s] individual ideas that you like here CCI
[688.16s] uh Crown crown castle was on with you uh
[690.639s] earlier this Stock&#39;s come up a little
[692.44s] bit but you still get a 5.5% yield uh
[695.12s] it&#39;s got 40,000 Towers they&#39;re selling
[696.76s] the small sale fiber business to delever
[698.6s] the balance sheet new CEO Steve MOS I&#39;ve
[700.8s] been waiting for this stock to go to the
[701.92s] Moon though for like 10 years like yeah
[703.8s] it&#39;s gone up like from 100 to 115 you
[706.279s] collected a yield in the meantime as
[708.279s] rates come down it&#39;ll stay up there&#39;s
[710.32s] been doing pretty well lately yeah
[711.76s] brought brought to you by spam right I
[713.48s] mean they got spam they got Skippy they
[715.839s] got Planters this is a steady grower got
[718.12s] beat down 3 and half% % yield we like
[720.56s] this particularly in a defensive
[722.079s] environment right now until we figure
[723.399s] out what&#39;s going on and then backer
[725.399s] medical supplies medical devices 3.2%
[728.92s] yield they&#39;re spinning off the kidney
[730.72s] business it&#39;ll rate the multiple back
[732.48s] from 10 to a normalized 15 multiple as
[735.24s] that gets done toward the end of the
[736.32s] year all right so the bottom line though
[737.44s] these are defensive you&#39;re getting paid
[739.44s] you&#39;re holding quality names you
[741.24s] probably sleep better at night that&#39;s
[742.6s] right we&#39;ll get offensive again very
[744.12s] soon but not just yet all right let me
[745.88s] know when thanks a lot Thomas all right
[747.32s] folks so um my next guest
[750.8s] and we&#39;re back and then want to get to
[754.0s] the quote of the week from SE Seth
[756.6s] claran successful investors tend to be
[759.399s] unemotional allowing the greed and fear
[761.88s] of others to play into their hands by
[764.6s] the way this was a great week a great
[766.72s] example for that by having confidence in
[769.12s] their own analysis and judgment and like
[771.68s] we always say know what you own uh they
[774.519s] respond to Market forces not with blind
[776.839s] emotion but with calculated reason
[779.6s] successful investors for example Dem
[781.6s] demonstrate caution in frothy markets
[784.24s] and steadfast conviction in panicky ones
[787.56s] indeed the very way an investor views
[789.959s] the market and its price fluctuations is
[792.399s] a key factor in his or her ultimate
[795.519s] investment success or failure so those
[798.56s] of you who have been with us for a while
[800.24s] know that we live by this philosophy and
[802.399s] many of you have been picking it up for
[803.959s] yourselves and benefiting accordingly
[806.32s] and then final quote of the week is from
[808.68s] Warren Buffett great investment
[810.839s] opportunities come around when excellent
[812.8s] companies are surrounded by unusual
[815.76s] circumstances that cause the stock to be
[838.04s] misappreciation first name wrong uh was
[841.0s] on Charles Payne saying This Time It&#39;s
[843.12s] Different
[844.92s] because immigration and covid hiring
[848.639s] skew the numbers we will see if that&#39;s
[851.56s] the case or not we tend to be in that
[853.48s] camp that there same thing with the
[855.519s] inverted yield curve two years ago
[857.44s] people were saying the curve is inverted
[858.959s] we&#39;re going to get a recession I said
[860.199s] hey we already had the recession q1 and
[862.6s] Q2 of 2022 was a technical recession uh
[867.56s] and I think this will prove to be the
[869.279s] case as well provided the FED steps in
[871.839s] quickly enough and gets that done
[873.399s] because these jobless claims numbers and
[876.04s] unemployment numbers are moving up the
[878.44s] other thing that happened on the jobs
[880.56s] report was that more people entered the
[883.92s] workforce which is also a positive thing
[886.88s] which is why wages are coming down uh
[889.759s] and unemployment is going up because
[891.32s] there&#39;s a new supply of labor which
[893.0s] we&#39;ve been waiting for for uh the excess
[895.6s] savings to run out so people had to go
[897.079s] to work by the way this is my beautiful

[953.56s] forever don&#39;t get sucked into Japan it&#39;s
[956.92s] now down 25 fell 25% in 3 days or four
[961.88s] days the uh topics did and the Nik
[964.639s] similar amounts um economic surprise
[968.519s] index uh UK is going up we like that
[971.639s] recovery story we&#39;ll talk a little bit
[973.079s] about gxo not we&#39;ll maybe go into more
[975.199s] detail with gxo next week and what did
[977.92s] private clients buy last week before uh
[980.92s] Japan collapsed is they bought Japanese
[982.839s] equities at the top and got their faces
[984.639s] ripped off August does well in election
[986.92s] years we&#39;re still of that camp which we
[989.0s] covered last week we think we&#39;re going
[990.279s] to see strength into the first cut which
[992.519s] is late September and then we&#39;re going
[994.399s] to see uh sell the news into the
[996.88s] election and a year-end rally is our
[998.839s] base case this is the chart that I
[1001.16s] referenced with Charles on making money
[1004.16s] with Charles pain on Fox
[1006.24s] Business we there&#39;s a uh back lag of
[1010.0s] global liquidity coming to Bear the most
[1012.639s] Global Central Bank Cuts since May of
[1015.68s] 2020 did you want to be a buyer or a
[1018.44s] seller of equities in May 2020 you
[1021.16s] wanted to be a massive buyer so we&#39;ve
[1023.44s] had 35 Cuts in the last 3 months uh in
[1026.52s] May of 2022 we had 92 Cuts globally and
[1030.679s] in April 2009 we had 76 Cuts so I would
[1034.199s] imagine in the next month two months
[1036.439s] three months we&#39;re going to see this up
[1037.76s] to 60 Cuts around the globe which is the
[1040.88s] perfect environment to be a buyer not a
[1043.199s] seller of
[1044.559s] equities uh that was the NASDAQ I think
[1047.199s] corrected 15% Peak to trough we were
[1050.12s] fortunate as you guys can go back to the
[1052.44s] tapes uh of taking a bunch of the uh
[1055.96s] alphabet and Amazon reluctantly by the
[1059.24s] way saying we hate taking this but we&#39;re
[1061.44s] going to have a chance to buy it a lot
[1062.72s] lower are we buying it back yet no uh
[1066.0s] but um we&#39;re keeping a close eye on it
[1068.44s] there just too many other great things
[1069.799s] to do uh yeah 15% NASDAQ draw down I
[1074.44s] think that wasn&#39;t even as of
[1080.039s] let&#39;s see yeah uh Russell gave back some
[1082.88s] gains too so that happened but keep in
[1086.32s] mind the outperformance the 12 months
[1088.28s] following the first cut number one
[1090.32s] number two this is was kind of a global
[1092.32s] deleveraging scare uh credit unwind
[1095.6s] we&#39;re probably going to find out as I
[1096.919s] shared with uh Charles that a couple of
[1099.08s] funds blew up from margin calls and over
[1101.2s] leverage over the weekend and this stuff
[1103.2s] will get back to normal The Narrative
[1104.6s] will get back to the normal why because
[1106.72s] it&#39;s underpinned by earnings
[1109.52s] and uh uh small cap earnings are going
[1112.76s] to grow dramatically faster than large
[1115.36s] cap uh over the next 12 months which is
[1118.08s] supportive of them outperforming after
[1119.919s] the first
[1122.76s] cut as you can see the Russell fell a
[1125.039s] lot less than the NASDAQ vix got up to
[1129.44s] 65 which is normally a sign of massive
[1132.52s] capitulation on Monday and um it looks
[1137.44s] that way but don&#39;t be shocked if there
[1140.32s] are some after effects for the next few
[1141.96s] days there&#39;ll be funds blowing up Margin
[1145.039s] Call liquidating so you&#39;re going to have
[1147.12s] some aftershocks just accept that use it
[1149.76s] as the opportunity but on balance we
[1152.799s] remain constructive for the next six to
[1155.08s] seven weeks uh cyclicals versus
[1157.799s] defensives you know they got smoked out
[1160.28s] here&#39;s the Nik and it fell a lot more
[1162.44s] than this by the way this is from August
[1166.24s] 5th um unbelievable this is remember all
[1170.0s] through this period I was saying do not
[1171.88s] get trapped everyone wanted wanted to
[1173.84s] buy Japanese equities hand over fist
[1176.24s] their demographics are crap they have no
[1179.96s] the Japan is where China will be five
[1183.76s] years from now okay but we&#39;re going to
[1186.039s] get a parabolic move in China before
[1188.559s] then is our base case and the unwinding
[1191.2s] of the Yen carry trade and getting all
[1192.84s] this hot Chinese money out of Japan uh
[1195.559s] is going to be very positive for Chinese
[1198.2s] equities the Yuan strength positive the
[1201.76s] uh bond yield starting to go up positive
[1204.24s] all the things that we need to see China
[1206.159s] and even CH uh China Services PMI went
[1208.84s] up this week which was positive to see
[1210.96s] we&#39;re going to see some earnings in the
[1212.32s] next few weeks which is also positive
[1214.28s] Nik volatility over 75
[1217.6s] unbelievable Yen absolutely collapsing
[1220.44s] remember all this period here you were
[1222.799s] all probably thinking for two months I
[1224.6s] was saying the yen is going to you want
[1227.12s] to get long the Yen you to get long the
[1229.24s] end and short the dollar and this was
[1230.559s] one of the biggest moves in history that
[1232.24s] we just saw um and it&#39;s setting things
[1235.88s] up for everything we need to do that&#39;s
[1237.4s] the Som rule that we already discussed
[1239.64s] three-month moving anyway we we know
[1241.6s] what that is um go back to the Liz
[1244.0s] claiming tape twoyear inflation swap
[1247.08s] 10year Break Even rate inflation break
[1249.36s] evens are now nearing 2% which mean
[1252.679s] means inflation is not only not a
[1255.08s] problem but deflation is starting to
[1256.76s] come into view if they don&#39;t move
[1258.2s] aggressive ly or they don&#39;t move quickly
[1261.52s] I think all they really need to do is be
[1263.32s] doish like you saw with ghouls be
[1265.64s] yesterday if something breaks will fix
[1267.28s] it which is kind of not the ideal
[1270.88s] strategy uh but da also said that she&#39;s
[1274.159s] not worried about it but we&#39;re still
[1275.679s] going to give accommodative policy very
[1279.36s] soon average hourly warning earnings
[1282.2s] collapsing this is what I talk about
[1283.76s] when I talk about demographics India too
[1286.44s] early The Sweet Spot is 30 to 40 when
[1290.0s] the bulk of the population is 35 to 40
[1291.919s] you get the most amount of equity gains
[1294.2s] and economic gains in the shortest
[1295.6s] amount of time because that&#39;s when
[1296.72s] people spend the most in their life
[1298.08s] cycle China you&#39;ve got that right now uh
[1301.559s] but as you look out five years from now
[1304.919s] they&#39;re all going to be over 40 in ch
[1307.2s] India you&#39;re not even close there India
[1309.559s] is going to be what you want to play
[1311.6s] after you take all your profits in China
[1314.2s] five years out and us is in a great
[1316.48s] situation also with a ton of millennials
[1319.0s] at 35 and that will continue to be
[1321.76s] pretty strong uh throughout 2050 and
[1325.52s] Beyond we have a pretty good situation
[1327.64s] because of immigration because of
[1330.72s] Millennials Etc birth rate is better
[1332.919s] than other places India I think is going
[1335.12s] to be the best place to invest probably
[1338.72s] from
[1340.4s] 20 30
[1342.88s] to 2050 I think you&#39;ll make the most
[1346.0s] amount of money in the shortest amount
[1347.32s] of time in India I think it&#39;s too early
[1350.44s] right now and they need a lot more
[1353.12s] development uh summer olympics of course
[1355.44s] the United States
[1356.84s] dominated Wake Me Up When SE September
[1359.36s] Ends August both normally and in
[1362.76s] election year does fine September is
[1365.12s] when things get spotty worst month of
[1366.76s] the year which is why if we get the
[1368.799s] strength we expect into September that&#39;s
[1370.919s] when we would start to put on some
[1372.159s] tactical Hedges tactical shorts raise
[1374.64s] some cash to buy in the hole in
[1376.44s] September and early October head of the
[1378.84s] election when fear is acute S&amp;P 500
[1383.36s] returns following 5% pullbacks uh this
[1388.039s] shows the percent of time positive is
[1391.88s] more than uh
[1394.36s] 80% 6 months
[1397.84s] out 85% 6 months out
[1400.88s] 80% 3 months out 70% one month out the
[1405.32s] median return one month out is 3%
[1409.2s] um 3 months out is 5% 6 months out is 7%
[1414.279s] and 12 months out is 11% so they&#39;re
[1417.24s] basically saying buy the dip this is
[1419.12s] from macro charts showing that basically
[1421.64s] the put call skew got so lopsided this
[1424.679s] is usually times you want to be a buyer
[1426.48s] not a seller then 5% pullbacks occur
[1430.44s] more than three times a year on average
[1433.44s] so this is pretty normal stuff 10%
[1436.2s] pullbacks occur one time per year on
[1438.64s] average this is all data going back to
[1440.919s] 1930 sometimes when you burden yourself
[1443.08s] with the facts it puts things in
[1445.24s] perspective and puts you at ease during
[1447.159s] these opportunities 15% Corrections
[1449.76s] occur every other year on average and
[1452.36s] 20% pullbacks occur every 3 to four
[1455.44s] years on average which is consistent
[1458.64s] with um with recessions now we&#39;ve
[1463.08s] already had 2 20% pullbacks in the last
[1466.64s] four years so we&#39;re do to not have one
[1469.44s] for some time we had one in 2020 and we
[1472.159s] had one in 2022 both times we had
[1474.88s] recession so we&#39;re actually pulled
[1477.2s] forward a lot of recession and 20%
[1479.559s] drawbacks therefore we should only be
[1481.799s] looking more likely for our average 10%
[1484.039s] a year which we got more than that in
[1485.679s] the NASDAQ I think we came close Peak to
[1487.64s] trough in the
[1489.44s] SNP and um and the 5% pullbacks that
[1492.919s] those are going to come three times a
[1494.2s] year no matter what you do I think we&#39;ve
[1496.32s] had two already we&#39;ll probably get the
[1497.799s] third one in September October this was
[1500.679s] an excerpt from an article in bar uh
[1503.2s] Bloomberg China becoming appealing the
[1505.64s] violent reaction increases the
[1507.32s] probability of rotation to Chinese
[1509.36s] equities from Japan says Frank Ben
[1513.159s] benra strategist at sgen Chinese
[1516.36s] equities have low valuations and tend to
[1518.32s] be relatively more insulated during
[1520.84s] Global stress the quote irrational
[1523.159s] selloff in Asia has made under own China
[1525.96s] an opportunity said William y director
[1528.72s] at Invesco Hong Kong over the last 2 to
[1531.08s] 3 years China&#39;s positioning for fund
[1533.279s] managers has probably been one of the
[1534.799s] lowest in history we covered that with
[1536.6s] Charles in the context of multiple
[1539.0s] Global macro risk emerging recently we
[1540.919s] see mainland China as a relative
[1543.64s] defensive especially since many of the
[1546.679s] country specific risks appear to be
[1548.679s] already priced in you think um Chinese
[1552.96s] stocks outperformed Global during the
[1556.0s] global market route while everything
[1557.6s] else was up Mainland what China while
[1560.159s] everything else was getting shellacked
[1561.88s] the topics Etc uh down 25% Chinese
[1565.52s] stocks were out
[1568.799s] performing which is
[1571.08s] amazing haven&#39;t had it&#39;s it&#39;s exciting
[1573.799s] to see let&#39;s just put it that way ISM
[1575.52s] services are going up new ERS up
[1579.08s] mortgage rates are going down that&#39;s a
[1581.2s] positive thing that&#39;s also going to help
[1583.159s] refinancing uh commercial properties
[1585.36s] that&#39;s going to help refinancing multif
[1586.919s] family where there&#39;s pockets of distress
[1589.24s] that&#39;s going to help refinancing small
[1591.799s] cap companies all positive things uh
[1595.2s] number of Britain&#39;s expecting the
[1596.48s] economy to get better over the next year
[1598.159s] reaches 2-year High we&#39;ve been talking
[1600.679s] about the UK recovery gxo Etc
[1603.44s] magnificent 7 Drew Down uh looks like
[1607.52s] 18% uh so far and uh that was another
[1611.52s] thing we were calling for for a few
[1612.919s] months and then it finally came uh we
[1615.159s] climaxed in uh June 20th when we put out
[1618.36s] the article about Nvidia the new pain
[1620.919s] trade that day it uh opened at 136 went
[1624.72s] up to 139 after we said it was the new
[1626.88s] pain trade of course it always goes
[1628.32s] against us before it goes for us uh and
[1631.039s] then it just collapsed down I think it
[1632.6s] got into the 90s
[1634.279s] yesterday 40% draw down uh Vic straight
[1638.039s] up to 65 let&#39;s pull up some of these RBC
[1640.96s] charts for my friend over
[1643.679s] there this is from slomer this came out
[1647.159s] today so you can see in the scheme of
[1649.919s] things this is not a very big correction
[1651.88s] so does it pull back all the way down to
[1653.64s] 4500 that&#39;s what his chart would imply
[1656.279s] I&#39;m not of that camp I think that this
[1658.12s] is going to be uh more subdued in nature
[1662.24s] quick acute deleveraging among leverag
[1664.84s] funds and um you know maybe that that
[1668.279s] becomes in play in September October but
[1670.72s] I don&#39;t think it&#39;s going to come in now
[1672.679s] this is the monthly seasonality since
[1674.279s] 1928 that we were referencing you can
[1677.0s] see here September is the month that we
[1678.679s] should start to be more concerned
[1680.6s] election year versus non-election year
[1683.32s] uh you can see the correction here he&#39;s
[1685.799s] pointing to 4950 maybe maybe that
[1688.32s] that&#39;ll be the aftershocks I&#39;m not
[1689.96s] really in that camp yet I think earnings
[1692.08s] have been too strong but let&#39;s let&#39;s see
[1693.84s] what happens sometimes it has nothing to
[1695.44s] do with earnings it&#39;s just uh margin
[1697.36s] calls that throw people
[1700.039s] off this other chart he has takes it
[1702.48s] down to
[1703.399s] 5071 NASDAQ already came down to 50 50%
[1707.679s] retrace trement and
[1711.039s] um 20,000 to 177,000 so yeah we covered
[1715.519s] that 18% on the mag
[1718.159s] 7 40% on
[1722.32s] Nvidia
[1725.0s] and let&#39;s see if there&#39;s anything else
[1727.08s] so small caps this you know it look felt
[1729.2s] like a lot it&#39;s not really a lot it&#39;s
[1730.84s] bouncing off this 50-day moving average
[1733.559s] I think it&#39;s already made its move and
[1735.399s] this can start to work higher cup and
[1737.44s] handle back up to new highs uh we like
[1740.32s] that story supported by earnings not by
[1742.32s] hope or by chart patterns uh the topics
[1745.399s] that&#39;s
[1746.64s] down more than this that&#39;s
[1749.36s] 81 why does you have an 81 chart on an
[1751.76s] 86 book that makes that&#39;s lazy uh this
[1755.32s] probably got all the way down to here
[1758.399s] let me just see
[1761.12s] here t o p
[1765.559s] iix oh n
[1777.44s] okay
[1781.96s] n so yeah it got down to 42,000 to
[1790.12s] 30
[1793.32s] 31,000 that&#39;s a big
[1796.159s] drop and now it bounced
[1801.08s] uh topics weekly that was as
[1807.32s] of yeah this is a better view I think he
[1810.48s] just forgot to update that chart this
[1812.88s] here shows that all the year&#39;s gains
[1814.84s] have been erased in Tokyo the Hang sang
[1817.919s] broke out of this downward Trend spiked
[1821.0s] higher earlier in the year checked back
[1823.039s] now it&#39;s starting to go back up that&#39;s
[1825.08s] actually a very nice retracement let&#39;s
[1826.96s] see how that plays out with earnings uh
[1829.24s] 10-year yield collapsed down to 370 and
[1831.84s] change remember we said 375 as a matter
[1834.799s] of fact we did take off a lot of our
[1837.279s] TLT on Friday and Monday when it just
[1840.88s] puked out we had huge profits on some of
[1843.279s] those uh call spreads and uh made many
[1846.44s] multiples on those and
[1851.88s] um I think this will Trend lower but
[1854.08s] it&#39;s due for a bounce here so we may
[1855.96s] just put that back on sometime in
[1858.559s] September and make uh take get two bites
[1860.88s] at that Apple uh this fell off his chart
[1864.0s] which is pretty wild this is what we&#39;d
[1865.679s] expecting looking at the dollar all
[1867.679s] these things why we continue to
[1869.0s] emphasize it because they&#39;re key for the
[1870.48s] China trade uh all falling into place
[1873.32s] the dollar is weakening collapsed
[1878.399s] here the Yen all the hot money coming
[1880.84s] out of Japan Canadian dollar don&#39;t worry
[1882.96s] you Looney you lunatics Looney loonatics
[1887.12s] uh Canadian Looney
[1888.639s] the can Canadian dollar will appreciate
[1890.84s] against the US dollar coming to a
[1892.88s] theater near you that&#39;s going to be a
[1894.48s] great trade uh same thing probably with
[1897.039s] the Australian dollar as China picks
[1898.84s] back up probably same with copper uh
[1901.72s] let&#39;s see if there other any other key
[1903.279s] charts we want to cover here with
[1908.08s] him semiconductor equipment huge
[1912.159s] drop Vago
[1919.32s] Scott&#39;s Miracle Grow we&#39;ve covered that
[1920.76s] a few times we do like that stock
[1926.48s] um all the utilities have absolutely
[1930.639s] rallied we&#39;ve been talking utilities
[1932.32s] forever now the hedge funds are getting
[1934.399s] into them they&#39;re due for a pullback you
[1936.519s] watch what happens with those uh so if
[1939.279s] you&#39;ve run with the utilities that we&#39;ve
[1941.399s] been talking about take some profits
[1943.84s] now uh and you can probably read those
[1946.519s] in September
[1950.32s] and that&#39;s that on that front let&#39;s
[1952.039s] finish up these other charts spreads
[1955.2s] blew out a little bit yesterday Global
[1957.639s] pmis is going up manufacturing that&#39;s
[1959.679s] good Financial stress going up from that
[1961.32s] deleveraging yesterday delinquencies
[1963.88s] going up modestly but not extreme
[1965.88s] relative to history whe except for
[1967.72s] student loans because they&#39;ve all a lot
[1969.96s] of them have been forgiven auto loans
[1972.2s] are going up uh that will also be helped
[1974.88s] by lower rates is financing autos which
[1978.2s] is a big
[1981.2s] deal earning surprise have been better
[1984.08s] than the pre-co
[1985.639s] average Q2 earnings surprise to the
[1988.12s] upside by
[1989.76s] 5.5% uh that is better better than plus
[1994.399s] 3.7% preco average earnings growth
[1999.279s] was uh
[2001.399s] 15.3% X energy and financials that&#39;s
[2004.72s] pretty big uh regular earnings growth
[2008.32s] was
[2009.519s] 11.5% all in we&#39;re going to talk about
[2012.08s] that at the end uh Monday&#39;s vix closing
[2015.48s] level ranks in the 96 percentile since
[2018.84s] 1999 some level of capitulation and
[2021.36s] margin calling going on there which is
[2023.76s] why we don&#39;t use much leverage
[2026.88s] um and the largest calendar year Peak to
[2030.159s] trough S&amp;P draw down uh just about hit
[2033.76s] looks like it hit about 9% probably
[2036.2s] probably Futures hit
[2038.32s] 10% would be my expectation if you do
[2041.6s] from overnight charts uh you would see
[2044.279s] that it actually got to a little
[2046.039s] correction there gxo earnings second
[2049.04s] quarter Revenue increased 19%
[2051.359s] year-over-year to a record 2.8 billion
[2054.119s] with Organic Revenue growth of 2% they
[2056.76s] signed new business wins of
[2058.0s] approximately 270 million in annualized
[2061.28s] revenue and got a sales pipeline
[2063.48s] increase to the 12-month high of 2.3
[2066.56s] billion they completed the the Winton
[2068.56s] acquisition in the UK which we had
[2070.76s] talked about uh all of this is positive
[2073.599s] they generated 115 million of cash flows
[2076.359s] from operations compared to 61 Million
[2078.639s] last year and 31 million of free cash
[2081.639s] flow compared with 3 million of free
[2083.48s] cash flow last year same quarter that&#39;s
[2086.8s] a big deal remember this is troughing it
[2089.76s] the whole world was Goods uh from 2020
[2092.76s] to 2022 lot of pull forward then it was
[2096.56s] uh working through inventory iies from
[2098.24s] 23 and
[2100.4s] 24 and now they&#39;re back on
[2104.68s] track with a more balanced
[2108.68s] situation which is goods and
[2112.52s] services which will be positive for
[2116.599s] their growth going
[2118.52s] forward so just had to get this plugged
[2122.52s] in so we don&#39;t lose power there we go uh
[2126.599s] so we&#39;ll go into gxo the conference call
[2129.28s] Etc next week we&#39;ve got other ones that
[2131.92s] we spent more time on for this week uh
[2135.16s] VF Corp the name of the game with VF
[2137.76s] Corp is the fact that they&#39;re
[2139.359s] deleveraging their balance sheets the
[2140.839s] sales are still down they did have some
[2143.28s] big turnarounds in China was really
[2146.599s] really strong I saw as I was going
[2149.319s] through the numbers today the stock was
[2151.88s] up pretty big because after the
[2153.68s] conference call um but the key thing
[2156.599s] that was important to me okay greater
[2159.68s] China Allin but it was by
[2162.04s] brand it was one of the brands that was
[2164.44s] just off the charts in China we&#39;ll go
[2167.88s] into it in more detail next week but if
[2170.48s] you look at the balance
[2174.52s] sheet
[2177.04s] um number one they
[2183.68s] generated let&#39;s get this here okay
[2186.92s] wanted let&#39;s look at the long-term debt
[2189.52s] it&#39;s gone from in the last three
[2191.24s] quarters it&#39;s gone from 5.7 billion to
[2195.04s] 4.7 billion to 3.9 billion now they got
[2198.96s] the 1.5 billion coming in from the sale
[2201.88s] of supreme which are going to take this
[2204.56s] down again so now their balance Sheet&#39;s
[2206.24s] going to be in good shape which all you
[2208.0s] need is free cash flow and a good
[2211.72s] balance sheet and then you have the
[2213.079s] runway to turn everything around uh and
[2215.96s] you&#39;re back Off to the Races
[2219.359s] so uh let&#39;s see here balance sheet
[2225.04s] review okay free cash
[2229.2s] flow turn
[2236.16s] 31
[2243.92s] margin moderated
[2248.839s] okay so he&#39;s still more energized than
[2250.44s] ever that&#39;s good to see we&#39;re going to
[2252.04s] go into this more the conference call
[2254.0s] was good you could tell by the way the
[2256.2s] stock acted today and the key is the
[2258.88s] balance sheet risk is now off the table
[2260.92s] which is like what we had to go through
[2262.68s] with Cooper standard and by the way
[2264.8s] Cooper standard&#39;s debt got upgraded
[2266.96s] today which is mindboggling and exciting
[2269.64s] to see uh so next week we&#39;re going to go
[2272.76s] into VF Corp in a very detailed way but
[2276.599s] for now
[2279.96s] um we&#39;re pretty pleased with our first
[2282.88s] look in their turnaround because the
[2285.68s] solvency risk which is number one is off
[2287.8s] the table they&#39;ve got free cash flow
[2290.319s] they&#39;ve got a good balance sheet now
[2291.8s] they&#39;re just starting to turn revenues
[2293.48s] region by region um as for Teemu teu
[2297.76s] sellers revolt against fines and
[2299.8s] withheld pay so again we&#39;ve said for
[2302.92s] months that uh pin duo duo and teu is
[2307.079s] the number are either unsustainable or
[2310.04s] unreliable I think it may prove to be a
[2312.4s] combination of both you can refer back
[2313.96s] to that article in the financial times
[2317.48s] this is an article from Barons saying
[2320.64s] that uh talking about Intel we&#39;re going
[2322.96s] to cover a lot of Intel today and you
[2327.079s] know it says from the start G singer
[2329.0s] said his goal was to achieve leadership
[2330.52s] and Chip manufacturing by 2025 sure
[2332.96s] enough Intel&#39;s new processors called
[2335.0s] Panther Lake are scheduled for release
[2337.0s] in the second half of 2025 when I asked
[2339.359s] the senior Intel executive when Intel
[2341.48s] would finally be able to make a
[2342.68s] processor that&#39;s better at performance
[2344.44s] and power efficiency versus amd&#39;s
[2346.24s] offering offerings the person pointed to
[2348.359s] the new Panther Lake chip there&#39;s a
[2350.2s] glimmer of hope for Intel on the horizon
[2352.839s] uh that said I&#39;m not suggesting it&#39;s
[2354.2s] time to buy the stock until it&#39;s had too
[2355.68s] many missteps and false starts PR need
[2357.16s] to wait but basically the case that this
[2359.28s] author is making take him is that a lot
[2363.28s] of these bad decisions were made before
[2365.76s] Ginger Ginger took the helm at 2021 many
[2369.0s] of Intel&#39;s problems stem from decisions
[2370.92s] made by his predecessor take several
[2372.56s] years to hire the right Talent then
[2374.16s] develop then design then make new Chips
[2375.76s] we&#39;re going to go through it line by
[2376.839s] line in the article of the week so just
[2378.359s] hang tight China&#39;s Yuan climbs to
[2381.119s] seven-month high on stronger Yen
[2382.88s] unwinding of global carry trade this is
[2385.319s] what we&#39;ve been waiting for ladies and
[2386.88s] gentlemen we&#39;ve done the overlays over
[2388.72s] and over again uh for months about the
[2391.92s] Yuan needing to appreciate dollar
[2394.2s] depreciate and uh Chinese yield on
[2397.839s] government debt start to go up we&#39;re
[2400.48s] going to we&#39;re going to talk about that
[2402.28s] in just a moment Global car trade y
[2405.28s] gains okay we covered that China&#39;s
[2408.04s] Services activity expands we covered
[2410.52s] that most popular trades are unraveling
[2413.28s] this I covered with Charles so what were
[2414.88s] the four most crowded trades last month
[2417.56s] and for many months before a long
[2419.8s] Magnificent Seven that&#39;s unwinding with
[2421.68s] the carry trade on
[2424.56s] wand second most crowded trade was short
[2427.88s] Yen had the biggest rally in the yen in
[2430.28s] the last two weeks that we&#39;ve ever
[2431.64s] probably seen in history three was short
[2435.52s] small caps that started to unwind last
[2438.68s] month it took a little hiccup this uh
[2441.28s] last week and a half that&#39;s going to re
[2442.88s] accelerate based on fundamentals and the
[2445.2s] fourth most crowded trade was short
[2446.76s] China equities and what did better than
[2449.04s] any other asset class in the last week
[2450.96s] China equities so uh that is what we&#39;ve
[2454.44s] been waiting for Global hedge funds
[2456.079s] actually added
[2457.88s] Chinese domestic stocks in July says
[2461.4s] Goldman Sachs this is daily saying a
[2463.56s] policy adjustment is still coming soon
[2465.04s] or rather than later even though she&#39;s
[2466.64s] not worried about anything at all she&#39;s
[2469.52s] still going to get that policy
[2470.76s] adjustment happening sooner rather than
[2472.359s] later in video which we had talked about
[2474.64s] before it crashed when everyone was
[2476.8s] clamoring all over each other to get
[2479.079s] stock after they did the split and
[2482.4s] sucked in all the new buyers uh Jensen
[2485.44s] Wong sold 323 million a stock in July
[2488.76s] before the decline he dumped it all on
[2490.839s] the retail investors heads so beware
[2493.28s] when that happens again I think people
[2494.839s] got wise to it because super micro or
[2497.92s] some one of those companies reported
[2499.359s] after the bell and they announced a
[2500.599s] split and the stock was down 9% uh
[2503.52s] afterm Market biggest margin debt on
[2506.119s] wine since 1999 spurred Taiwan Taiwan
[2510.079s] stock route that&#39;s why we don&#39;t use much
[2512.64s] leverage Chinese brokerages talk up
[2515.0s] local stocks after global meltdown
[2517.76s] Goldman says buying the S&amp;P after 5%
[2519.88s] drop is usually profitable we showed you
[2521.56s] the data behind
[2524.0s] that Mar here&#39;s from Nick timos from
[2527.44s] yesterday Market sell-offs upends Fed
[2530.72s] rate cut calculus a further slow down in
[2532.64s] the labor market could lead to a larger
[2535.52s] Half Point rate cut next month so the
[2538.4s] FED Whisperer is starting to drop hints
[2541.16s] about 50 basis point Cuts as a trial
[2545.079s] balloon for the feds setting the stage
[2548.119s] that&#39;s pretty interesting China
[2549.92s] defensive SE sectors win favor as Asian
[2552.28s] stocks stage rebound and now onto our
[2555.559s] article of the week like a phoenix From
[2558.599s] the Ashes stock market and sentiment
[2560.48s] results we talked about unwinding the
[2562.28s] carry trades here are the notes from the
[2564.0s] show you can go through but Marcel Munch
[2567.2s] many of you know from Germany he&#39;s had
[2569.2s] me on his podcast several times to talk
[2571.079s] about China and he&#39;s a China expert in
[2573.52s] his own
[2574.559s] right particularly with uh China e s he
[2579.16s] actually reposted an excerpt from a
[2582.4s] podcast I did in March that was
[2586.319s] eerily
[2588.079s] um predictive let&#39;s just put it that way
[2590.76s] it was it was really crazy to hear it uh
[2594.64s] I did on this exact subject about the
[2596.559s] carry trade in March that predicted the
[2598.319s] events that we&#39;ve now seen in the past
[2599.88s] week why I&#39;m going to replay this right
[2602.839s] now is because it also talks about what
[2606.359s] we were waiting for with the Yen and
[2609.119s] with the Chinese Yuan as an indicator
[2611.48s] for what would happen with Chinese
[2612.839s] equities in other words all the pieces
[2614.68s] are coming into the puzzle that should
[2616.559s] make Baba hum where we got earnings
[2618.88s] coming in we got the new buyers coming
[2620.4s] in but now the global macro things are
[2622.76s] actually benefiting to uh also offer
[2625.96s] support more important than the fed this
[2628.079s] week as it relates to central banks
[2630.04s] which is the Bank of Japan just
[2632.599s] handicapped a winning strategy what to
[2634.76s] know about the Yen carry
[2637.72s] trade if you&#39;re in finance you have to
[2640.0s] know about the carry trade so this is a
[2641.72s] great article from Barons that lays it
[2643.599s] out Simply uh what is it it it&#39;s very
[2646.8s] simple you borrow money in a country
[2648.68s] with very low interest rates and then
[2650.44s] invest in a country where you can get
[2652.52s] considerably higher returns Japan&#39;s
[2655.2s] Central Bank interest rate has been
[2656.44s] around zero since 2016 the US uh 10-year
[2659.64s] bond yield by contrast has been higher
[2661.92s] than at at least 2% for most of that
[2664.4s] time the pandemic was a lengthly
[2666.559s] exception
[2667.88s] this is the general idea borrow money at
[2669.68s] 0% interest carry it abroad to invest at
[2672.319s] 2% the difference is your profit it&#39;s a
[2675.079s] sure winner lending to governments is
[2677.4s] considered risk-free because there&#39;s
[2679.16s] virtually no chance they won&#39;t repay
[2681.359s] their debts they can always print more
[2683.359s] money take your cash to other places
[2685.92s] than the US and your profits could be
[2687.76s] even bigger for example Mexico&#39;s 10-year
[2689.96s] Government Bond is currently just shy of
[2692.599s] 10% who does it institutions what could
[2696.079s] go wrong uh while it seems like a sure
[2698.52s] thing and mostly has been there are
[2699.92s] still risk changes in interest rates and
[2701.96s] exchange rates can either reinforce or
[2703.88s] derail the strategy for example the
[2705.52s] boj&#39;s ultral loose policy has driven the
[2708.079s] yend to 30-year lows against the dollar
[2709.96s] which makes the carry trade even more
[2711.839s] profitable because you&#39;re borrowing in
[2713.44s] Yen at zero rates reinvesting in dollars
[2716.76s] uh and making the spread and then
[2718.24s] getting an appreciation in in the dollar
[2720.68s] relative to the Yen throughout that
[2722.64s] whole period but if the Yen starts to
[2724.88s] strengthen now it will cut into carry
[2727.28s] trades earnings Rising interest rates
[2729.559s] tend to strengthen currencies by making
[2731.28s] investments in those currencies more
[2733.4s] attractive the Yen sold off on headlines
[2735.2s] that the boj would keep an accommodated
[2736.88s] policy for a while but recent headlines
[2738.359s] are suggesting that further raid hikes
[2740.68s] may be forthcoming the problem for the
[2743.16s] Yen however is that volatility remains
[2745.16s] exceptionally low and the carry trade
[2746.359s] exceptionally popular is the carry trade
[2748.92s] dead probably not yet interest rates in
[2751.16s] Japan are still much lower than
[2752.28s] elsewhere boj said it will move slowly
[2754.119s] and cautiously but the decision to raise
[2755.8s] rates does change the game especially
[2758.319s] because the next move in interest rates
[2759.839s] in the US and Europe is expected to be
[2763.119s] down the carry trade will almost
[2765.359s] certainly become a lot less popular who
[2768.119s] are the winners this is the most
[2771.0s] important thing and we&#39;ve been hinting
[2773.119s] towards this for months and this is key
[2777.04s] China has the most to gain if the boj
[2780.8s] continues to raise interest rates
[2783.68s] thereby strengthening the Yen China and
[2787.04s] Japan both rely heavily on exports of
[2789.48s] things like electronics and cars for
[2792.04s] economic growth and a stronger Yen
[2794.559s] compared to the Yuan will make Chinese
[2796.96s] Goods more attractively priced it will
[2800.28s] also help to finally take the Chinese
[2803.72s] Yuan off the mat and appreciate the Yuan
[2807.2s] which is the key that we&#39;ve been looking
[2810.24s] at as it related to our exposure in
[2813.359s] China expressed in a position in Alibaba
[2817.8s] and what we&#39;ve been talking about is as
[2820.16s] the fed eases and the dollar weakend
[2822.28s] Emerging Markets will get bid and China
[2824.2s] will be a benefici that is true but what
[2827.72s] I laid out here which is even more
[2829.88s] important is the yuan&#39;s relationship to
[2832.76s] the US dollar and as we can see almost
[2835.88s] perfectly as the Yuan rallied from 2000
[2839.68s] relative to the US dollar the Yuan
[2841.64s] strengthened uh from 2016 to 2018
[2845.319s] Alibaba had a parabolic move the Yuan
[2848.92s] strength is in Black the Alibaba is in
[2851.96s] red and you can see as the Yuan went up
[2854.8s] Alibaba went parabolic the Yuan rolled
[2857.04s] over Alibaba
[2859.319s] crashed down and then uh the final rally
[2863.2s] as the Yuan started to recover you had
[2865.48s] that parabolic move into 2021 with Ali
[2869.44s] Baba Yuan rolled over Alibaba and the
[2872.88s] rest of Chinese and kweb stocks crashed
[2875.64s] it&#39;s been doing this double bottom and
[2878.24s] this could have been the sea change we
[2881.52s] have all been waiting for ladies and
[2884.44s] gentlemen that we get this double bottom
[2886.68s] in like we saw in
[2888.599s] 2019 and 2020 and a parabolic move up
[2893.0s] and we get the Yuan off the mat Yuan
[2895.0s] starts to appreciate because the boj&#39;s
[2897.359s] new policy stance and the fed&#39;s new
[2899.319s] policy stance uh Yuan being appreciative
[2902.96s] stance of tightening rates fed being
[2905.44s] depreciative stance of loosening rates
[2908.28s] strengthening the Yuan which will cause
[2910.96s] the flows into China into Chinese
[2914.48s] equities to explode yet again no one can
[2918.0s] see that right now until it happens and
[2920.48s] then this will be the most hated rally
[2923.64s] all the way up of all time no one will
[2926.839s] believe it until it hits 200 then they
[2929.359s] will hate it and then they will join it
[2931.64s] and that&#39;s what will happen and today
[2934.599s] was the warning
[2937.52s] shot fired all around the world
[2940.92s] following the meeting when the FED
[2943.319s] confirmed they were going to be doish
[2945.52s] and they have no choice Bank of Japan
[2949.559s] has been the liquidity back stop for
[2951.96s] Global central banks while they got
[2954.0s] inflation under control for the last two
[2956.0s] years and now Japan is saying we&#39;ve got
[2960.119s] inflation coming we want to normalize
[2962.559s] our policy it&#39;s time for you to back
[2965.599s] stop us we are going to normalize policy
[2969.599s] and that is the global coordinated
[2972.16s] Central Bank policy that has worked so
[2974.44s] well so now it&#39;s flip-flopping from
[2977.92s] strong dollar weak Yen uh and weak
[2981.16s] foreign currencies to now weaker dollar
[2984.359s] weaker Euro stronger Yen uh Stronger Yen
[2988.839s] stronger Yuan and that will be great for
[2993.16s] Chinese equities and I think the
[2995.52s] misnomer here for everyone chasing
[2998.119s] Japanese equities is the stronger
[3001.119s] Japanese Yen despite all the
[3003.839s] constructive developments as it relates
[3006.16s] to corporate governance and uh spins and
[3010.599s] shareholder friendly policies moving in
[3013.0s] the right direction I do think the
[3015.76s] stronger Yen will be a headwind the
[3020.88s] weekend has been H Tailwind for the
[3023.92s] recent rally in Japanese stocks it will
[3026.48s] now become a headwind and all the
[3028.88s] Chinese flows that have come out of
[3031.44s] China and into Japan are now going to go
[3035.839s] back home as price starts to change
[3039.319s] opinion opinion follows Trend and this
[3043.079s] move here today albeit it doesn&#39;t mean
[3046.16s] that it&#39;s going to do it tomorrow but
[3047.68s] it&#39;s the beginning of this regime change
[3051.64s] that is significantly important for so
[3054.48s] many of the things that we&#39;re doing and
[3056.799s] for the global change uh around the
[3059.52s] world this will also support small caps
[3062.64s] this will also support RS this will also
[3065.96s] support dividend payers code value
[3069.44s] stocks like Stanley Black and&amp; Decker
[3072.599s] genac 3M all these Industrials that have
[3076.079s] been waiting to take off natural gas
[3078.44s] companies like Comstock resources etc
[3081.88s] etc etc so very excited here the 10year
[3086.599s] did not know what to do today um it
[3089.48s] started by collapsing and then it
[3091.04s] started to get bit up I think what
[3092.68s] you&#39;re going to see over the next few
[3095.799s] weeks is while the dollar starts to re
[3099.64s] weaken the Yen starts to get bid the
[3104.119s] Yuan starts to strengthen the 10-year
[3108.319s] bonds are going to slowly climb and
[3111.559s] yields are going to slowly compress now
[3115.359s] just as I always said
[3117.48s] with the FED because most of the time
[3120.28s] the the move is bad after Powell speaks
[3124.2s] and I always say don&#39;t get faked out the
[3126.92s] first move is often the wrong move it
[3130.16s] may in fact be the case that that could
[3132.72s] be true this time as well could we be
[3136.4s] Off to the Races for 19 out of 21 weeks
[3140.64s] up in US equities it could be that would
[3144.04s] be great I mean it was very interesting
[3146.24s] today today I think overall the
[3148.68s] portfolio is up 2.2% and the general
[3151.0s] indices were up between 90 basis points
[3153.2s] and and a buck so you know our Hedges
[3155.599s] were moving against us but the overall
[3157.44s] portfolio was outperforming uh the
[3159.839s] deterioration of the hedges as we&#39;re
[3161.319s] going to discuss in the article of the
[3162.799s] week um and it was a great day 2.2% on
[3165.92s] any day is great
[3168.24s] um uh it was it was interesting to see
[3172.799s] and maybe we&#39;ll get even further follow
[3174.599s] through and this will continue for
[3175.599s] another four weeks who knows I would be
[3179.4s] alert uh that that&#39;s all I was going to
[3181.76s] say as a matter of fact I was going to
[3183.599s] lean into the hedges today but we
[3185.68s] already have full 2% of equity Capital
[3188.48s] that is sufficient to create an extra uh
[3191.88s] um 10% of free Capital if we&#39;re right on
[3194.4s] the four to six% pullback over the next
[3196.28s] couple of months but
[3198.5s] [Music]
[3199.72s] um uh you know I
[3203.599s] wouldn&#39;t number one I wouldn&#39;t be
[3206.52s] pessimistic because a lot of things are
[3208.28s] lining up right and we&#39;re going to go
[3209.4s] through a list of them and number two I
[3212.2s] wouldn&#39;t be chasing if I wasn&#39;t already
[3214.88s] fully invested uh either especially in
[3218.4s] the shiny objects that have already
[3220.359s] run
[3222.76s] um because well you might get a few days
[3225.16s] follow through I would just keep an open
[3228.559s] mind sometimes that first move is a fake
[3230.28s] out and let&#39;s see how how it plays out
[3232.68s] uh in the next few days I think the real
[3235.359s] underlying move should be a you know as
[3239.24s] we look out for to to 12 weeks Yen
[3242.119s] starts to strengthen bonds start to get
[3244.0s] bid dollar starts to weaken uh Emerging
[3246.799s] Markets get bid us maybe flattish to
[3249.68s] down uh could be flat sideways which we
[3252.16s] discussed you know three four weeks ago
[3253.799s] we said probably the move that screws
[3255.28s] the most people is the the indices
[3257.96s] actually just grind sideways so they
[3259.76s] take out all the put premium they take
[3261.319s] out all the call Premium um and and and
[3264.92s] I&#39;d be open-minded to that because that
[3266.839s] implies now moving along to Intel on
[3270.48s] Thursday August
[3272.64s] 2nd uh Intel had reported earnings for
[3275.52s] Q2 revenues dropped 1% year on year and
[3277.76s] the stock dropped 30% which is something
[3280.28s] to keep in mind guys to keep things in
[3282.04s] perspective revenues were down 1% year
[3284.68s] on-ear the stock dropped 30% year onye
[3288.839s] so what does Warren Buffett talk about
[3290.96s] great investment opportunities come
[3292.839s] around when excellent companies are
[3294.119s] surrounded by unusual circumstances that
[3296.68s] caused the stock to be misappreciation
[3326.799s] in 11 years since 2013 the company also
[3329.52s] announced the suspension of the dividend
[3331.16s] starting in Q4 and a layoff of more than
[3333.4s] 15% of the workforce I spoke with CEO
[3335.96s] Pat galinger his only broadcast
[3337.799s] interview right after the analyst call
[3340.319s] last night starting with the
[3342.52s] layoff you know it&#39;s hard this is the
[3344.76s] Intel family so I feel this very deeply
[3348.319s] at the same time making the steps to
[3350.079s] have an efficient Intel for the future
[3353.2s] that has both process and product
[3354.799s] leadership but also Financial
[3357.079s] sustainability in the model you know
[3359.24s] we&#39;re committed to this journey you know
[3361.28s] this is the most substantial you know uh
[3364.28s] restructuring of Intel since the I&#39;ll
[3367.599s] say the memory microprocessor transition
[3370.24s] four decades ago we have laid out on an
[3373.599s] audacious journey of rebuilding this
[3376.2s] company and we&#39;re going to get that done
[3378.599s] and today&#39;s uh announcement is
[3380.4s] accelerating the financial piece of that
[3382.52s] even as we build on the product and
[3384.88s] process capab abilities that we&#39;ve put
[3387.16s] in place I asked Ginger about the
[3389.24s] reasoning Behind These Cuts aside from
[3391.2s] the immediate need to preserve
[3394.0s] cash we&#39;re making these cuts to build a
[3397.359s] more efficient Intel and what happened
[3399.96s] at the beginning of the year was We
[3401.559s] disclosed this new financial model the
[3403.96s] new operating model of Intel a
[3406.64s] worldclass fabulous company and a
[3408.76s] world-class Foundry Company we began a
[3411.88s] clean sheet analysis of the two pieces
[3414.52s] of the business and we said what does
[3416.839s] worldclass look like for each of those
[3419.799s] uh businesses because we were operating
[3421.68s] in the old model for five decades and
[3425.24s] that clean sheet exercise led us to say
[3428.0s] these are the changes that we need to be
[3430.359s] an efficient Nimble company for the
[3432.92s] future that&#39;s what&#39;s driving the
[3435.079s] restructuring that you&#39;ve heard us
[3436.599s] announced today the financial
[3438.599s] performance accelerated that a bit but
[3440.72s] the work was already launched and
[3442.319s] underway from the start of the year and
[3444.64s] now we want to get them done quickly so
[3446.599s] that we have this new operational model
[3448.88s] in place and fully supported by a more
[3451.24s] efficient organization so we expect the
[3453.96s] majority of these will be finished uh
[3455.839s] this year so that we&#39;re able to have a
[3458.2s] more efficient effective Intel Foundry
[3461.319s] Intel products and an overall Intel
[3464.799s] delivering product and process
[3466.52s] leadership with financial performance as
[3469.559s] well I also asked G singer why an
[3472.559s] investor seeing the stock plummet today
[3475.72s] and seeing the dividend suspension would
[3478.119s] put money in
[3479.88s] now well we believe that those
[3482.079s] foundational Investments are
[3484.319s] realizing beginning now right these new
[3487.48s] products we&#39;re seeing them come to life
[3489.88s] you know for instance the aipc is a
[3492.24s] great example of that we have the
[3494.16s] leadership product today with core Ultra
[3496.28s] we&#39;re about to announce the next
[3498.48s] generation of that at the EA show uh
[3501.319s] coming up next month you know lunar Lake
[3503.48s] our second generation core Ultra you
[3505.88s] know unquestioned leadership and
[3507.76s] performance and AI capabilities dramatic
[3510.96s] improvements and power you know our next
[3513.079s] Generation server products are shipping
[3515.119s] this quarter so I&#39;ll say all of this
[3517.24s] hard work that we&#39;ve done starts to
[3519.44s] materialize now and I think we&#39;ve reset
[3522.2s] the financial expectations now and we&#39;ve
[3525.0s] taken the steps that you know the
[3526.839s] markets should look at and say wow they
[3528.559s] are really getting their house in order
[3530.24s] for a efficient Intel building on the
[3534.28s] leadership Intel work of the last three
[3536.68s] years now is the opportunity to start
[3539.0s] benefiting from those and we believe
[3541.16s] that the guidance that we&#39;ve given is
[3543.079s] now you know well placed in the market
[3545.039s] the steps were taking you know well
[3546.88s] respected and with the products and the
[3549.24s] technology we&#39;re now well positioned to
[3551.64s] begin a very solid cycle you know for
[3554.079s] the Intel of the future this has been
[3556.119s] heavy lifting and we&#39;re now confident
[3557.88s] that building on that we can go forward
[3559.96s] effectively in the market for the future
[3562.64s] uh it was a tough quarter a few back and
[3565.16s] the Hope was that there was a trajectory
[3567.92s] after that point that would be more
[3569.599s] predictable we&#39;re here now um and it
[3573.079s] sounds like you&#39;re saying that again at
[3574.48s] what point do we know that those kinds
[3576.76s] of surprises and the needs for
[3578.359s] realignment are out of the way or is
[3581.2s] this just such a a rocky period uh for
[3585.76s] Intel and the the changes that are
[3587.96s] needed in the industry that you can&#39;t
[3589.76s] say clearly you know this has been a
[3592.319s] challenging rebuild this has been an
[3594.16s] audacious rebuilding of Intel one that
[3597.52s] I&#39;m proud of the work that we&#39;ve done
[3599.24s] you know rebuilding a company like this
[3601.319s] is heavy work we always said it was
[3603.76s] going to be a five plus year Journey
[3606.839s] here we are three years in we&#39;ve
[3608.48s] accomplished the most significant
[3610.799s] process technology you know cycle people
[3613.52s] didn&#39;t think it was possible now the end
[3616.2s] is clearly in sight as we&#39;ve released
[3618.319s] the pdk the products have come to life
[3621.64s] These are significant Milestones ones
[3624.319s] that people thought were impossible
[3626.079s] three years ago they&#39;re now done John
[3628.839s] you know and building on that these new
[3630.52s] products that we&#39;re bringing these are
[3632.0s] competitive products you know we&#39;re no
[3633.64s] longer in a position that we&#39;re losing
[3635.359s] market share because we have inadequate
[3637.44s] products and our AI products aipc our
[3641.319s] gouty 3 that we&#39;re beginning to ship
[3643.44s] this quarter you know all of these
[3645.16s] things are now coming together so yes I
[3648.76s] understand some of those concerns but
[3650.319s] I&#39;d also say look at what we&#39;ve gotten
[3652.4s] done this is incredible what we&#39;ve
[3654.96s] gotten done and we&#39;re now combining that
[3656.839s] with the steps to build a more efficient
[3659.0s] Intel this is the most significant
[3660.88s] rebuilding of Intel in four plus decades
[3663.96s] I&#39;m proud of the work we&#39;ve gotten done
[3665.839s] and we&#39;re committed to finish the job
[3667.839s] and we are well on our way to do exactly
[3669.92s] that a lot riding on gudy 3 as that
[3673.16s] launches in Rams and aipc we&#39;ll see
[3675.119s] where Intel goes from
[3678.48s] here and we&#39;re back so I put out a note
[3683.119s] after earnings which I usually don&#39;t do
[3685.599s] by the way
[3688.079s] way on Twitter
[3691.24s] X and I said I quoted him launching in
[3695.079s] Q3 you know the big thing here is people
[3698.119s] are saying wow their numbers are so bad
[3700.039s] but it&#39;s like trying to sell cookies and
[3703.319s] your product is still in the oven so the
[3706.68s] product that everyone wants right now
[3708.28s] are AI chips GPU what are they selling
[3711.559s] is CPUs which has been their legacy
[3714.319s] business which they&#39;re obviously still
[3715.96s] doing you know 12 13 billion a quarter
[3718.48s] not too shabby um but the products that
[3723.2s] are going to really move the needle for
[3725.52s] are going to be the gpus which are
[3728.599s] actually just
[3730.039s] launching this quarter which is which so
[3732.839s] the game hasn&#39;t even started they&#39;re
[3734.799s] holding their own they&#39;re able to
[3736.079s] maintain their revenues basically flat
[3737.76s] year on-ear but they don&#39;t even have the
[3739.48s] products in the market that the market
[3740.92s] wants right now which you could say well
[3743.2s] why don&#39;t they because of all the bad
[3745.119s] decisions that were made
[3746.359s] that Ginger is writing with the four
[3748.319s] nodes in 5 years which is now basically
[3750.52s] complete but the market is too impatient
[3753.0s] which creates the Mis
[3754.359s] appraisal uh that creates the
[3756.52s] opportunity for people like us so
[3758.72s] launching in Q3 Intel&#39;s gouty 3 will
[3760.96s] take accelerated performance to the next
[3762.72s] level at just 2third the cost of
[3765.52s] competitive offerings to put it in
[3767.119s] perspective we expect Intel gouty 3 to
[3769.44s] deliver roughly two times the
[3771.16s] performance per dollar so on both
[3774.52s] inference and training versus is
[3776.079s] nvidia&#39;s h100 Chip so half the cost
[3779.559s] twice the performance 40% more energy
[3782.16s] efficient that&#39;s going to be competitive
[3783.96s] partner product especially because what
[3786.319s] did that Nvidia people used to say well
[3788.319s] it doesn&#39;t matter by the time you have
[3790.88s] your gouty 3 we&#39;re going to have
[3793.079s] Blackwell well Blackwell got delayed due
[3795.0s] to engineering Pro problems so it&#39;s
[3797.52s] going to give Intel a 3-month window to
[3800.119s] get this chip out there where everyone&#39;s
[3801.72s] going to start to say wait a second half
[3803.44s] the cost twice twice as efficient more
[3805.88s] energy efficient which cuts my overhead
[3808.68s] and Intel is going to gain some share
[3810.48s] here
[3812.799s] um so like like I said very hard to
[3815.2s] compete when the desired product is
[3816.559s] still baking in the oven that changes in
[3818.2s] Q3 for Intel which is now second quarter
[3821.119s] Revenue down 1% uh stock drop 30% Q3 is
[3825.44s] expected to be down 8% also weaker for
[3827.44s] the industry then Q4 Intel guides back
[3830.24s] to the Topp of range plus 5% Revenue
[3832.2s] growth year
[3833.44s] on-ear um as much as Intel disappointed
[3837.279s] from what they are communicating it
[3838.48s] looks like a temporary impairment versus
[3840.079s] a p permanent impairment it will take
[3842.68s] longer but time will tell price is what
[3844.24s] you pay value is what you get no one
[3845.96s] knows if price will go lower or higher
[3847.4s] in the short term but I&#39;ll take my
[3848.559s] chances on a firm that is set with
[3850.68s] government backing and support to become
[3852.88s] the leading AI systems Foundry and the
[3855.4s] second largest Foundry in the world by
[3858.0s] 2030 leading AI systems Foundry and
[3860.92s] second largest Foundry in the world by
[3862.559s] 2030 that&#39;s Ginger uh from q1 of of
[3866.64s] 2024 and you can see their products
[3868.92s] we&#39;re not going to go into that right
[3871.079s] now um but I also want to go into before
[3874.279s] I go through all the earnings and the
[3876.2s] transcript and all that other stuff I
[3877.64s] want to go through a couple
[3880.76s] articles that I thought were really
[3884.72s] helpful okay so this is from market
[3887.68s] watch it says Intel&#39;s worst drop in
[3889.119s] decades may have been steeper if not for
[3891.64s] this Factor the US government cannot
[3895.0s] afford to let Intel struggle over the
[3897.319s] longterm one analyst says uh well maybe
[3900.72s] two analyst because I&#39;ve been saying
[3902.119s] that for the last few weeks investors
[3905.279s] may have a sense that the company will
[3906.559s] be safe in the end despite its
[3908.039s] challenges thanks to Intel standing as a
[3910.039s] domestic chip manufacturer at a time
[3912.4s] when governments are interested in
[3913.799s] propping up local players in the chip
[3915.52s] Market in other circumstances we believe
[3918.24s] we would now be having going concern
[3920.319s] conversations with clients Bernstein
[3922.48s] Stacy ragon wrote a note to his clients
[3925.0s] by the way that&#39;s what the stock is
[3926.799s] trading like now and that is not on the
[3928.96s] table quote to just like Cooper standard
[3931.839s] when it was trading at $5 and $4 and $3
[3934.359s] when we were pounding the table to that
[3936.559s] end and perhaps the one positive
[3938.599s] subsidies and partner contributions when
[3940.44s] combined with spending cuts and dividend
[3942.559s] suspension looks set to add $40 billion
[3946.68s] of incremental cash to the company&#39;s
[3948.88s] balance sheet through the end of 2025
[3951.2s] suggesting Intel will survive in some
[3953.16s] form to continue the fight and that&#39;s
[3955.359s] the whole key with turnarounds is Runway
[3957.64s] right the subsidy point is intriguing
[3960.4s] intriguing Intel stuck a struck a deal
[3963.039s] with the US government earlier this year
[3965.119s] that awarded the company 8.5 billion in
[3967.039s] direct funding as well as 11 billion in
[3968.72s] loans through the chips act that&#39;s
[3970.799s] government program that&#39;s meant to
[3972.599s] bolster the US position in chip
[3975.16s] manufacturing and one that shows
[3976.64s] officials are thinking more seriously
[3978.799s] about help how to help players compete
[3980.96s] in this vital industry moving on uh
[3984.92s] given the increas inre inly critical
[3986.359s] role that semiconductors play and the
[3988.64s] precariousness of geopolitics
[3990.48s] governments including the US are making
[3992.039s] domestic chip capabilities more of a
[3994.0s] priority Intel sits in an especially
[3996.68s] important spot for the us because the
[3998.359s] company manufactures the chips itself
[4001.839s] that&#39;s the thing Nvidia and and all
[4004.48s] these other companies that don&#39;t
[4005.559s] manufacture own chips they are going to
[4007.92s] be at the mercy of Intel and Taiwan
[4010.4s] semiconductor which are going to have a
[4013.0s] duopoly our country and government
[4015.16s] cannot afford to let Intel founder and
[4018.079s] really struggle long term ASO desk based
[4020.44s] Jordan Klein said in a note to clients
[4022.799s] but Intel stands out the US government
[4024.64s] has a vested interest in Intel being a
[4026.799s] real player in Foundry and winning at
[4029.319s] the Leading Edge Klein wrote Intel is
[4031.559s] too important of a long-term strategic
[4033.72s] asset this reminds you of what of Boeing
[4037.44s] okay that&#39;s why Boeing hasn&#39;t been taken
[4038.88s] out to the Woodshed because it&#39;s a
[4040.4s] duopoly that&#39;s what Intel is going to be
[4042.839s] with Taiwan semiconductor Taiwan has
[4044.72s] taking us chip business one factor that
[4046.599s] led to a sharp subsequent decline in
[4048.039s] chip stocks though Intel stocks escaped
[4050.039s] that session unscathed demonstrating how
[4051.88s] investors view the company as the one
[4054.0s] that could benefit if nationalism comes
[4055.839s] to play more of a role in the industry
[4058.319s] Intel&#39;s conundrum parallels to that of
[4061.16s] Boeing another domestic Titan besieged
[4064.2s] BY execution issues that have P that
[4066.64s] have pressured financials but while
[4068.559s] Boeing isn&#39;t a major financial
[4070.2s] institution like a too big to fail Banks
[4072.559s] the company operates as the domestic
[4074.48s] half of a du ol with Airbus and it
[4077.4s] occupies a key position in the defense
[4079.44s] and Aerospace markets Boeing is an
[4081.839s] iconic business and major employer and
[4083.88s] the US government likely has a vested
[4085.68s] interest in its success as well as
[4087.76s] Intel&#39;s Intel&#39;s plan is to grow first
[4090.44s] and to shrink Intel&#39;s plan to grow first
[4093.039s] to shrink with layoffs reorganization
[4094.92s] and suspension of its shareholder
[4096.279s] dividend yet the news from Intel&#39;s
[4098.279s] second quarter earnings report on
[4100.159s] Thursday wasn&#39;t all bad Pat gelsinger
[4103.48s] continued to reiterate the company&#39;s
[4105.08s] ambitious plans for five nodes in four
[4107.719s] years to enables its Foundry business
[4110.0s] for both internal and external customers
[4112.159s] to catch up to Taiwan semiconduction
[4113.92s] manufacturing is still on track and
[4116.96s] executing as planned that means the
[4119.719s] critical 18a process node will indeed
[4122.52s] power some of Intel&#39;s most important
[4124.799s] products over the next two years the
[4126.719s] ability for Intel to be a key competitor
[4128.679s] in The Foundry space Remains the primary
[4131.159s] focus of the company&#39;s leadership Intel
[4133.48s] has shipped more has shipped more more
[4135.6s] than 15 million of its first AIP PC
[4139.6s] chips codenamed meteor Lake and is
[4142.279s] confident will have 40 million unit Ship
[4144.56s] by the end of 2024 that&#39;s a huge
[4146.96s] milestone and dwarfs dwarfs what AMD or
[4150.839s] Qualcomm could hope to do in the same
[4153.679s] time
[4155.839s] frame so that&#39;s that let&#39;s cover here
[4159.52s] there&#39;s so much to cover you really if
[4162.159s] you are thinking about owning it or
[4164.239s] already own it you really need to read
[4165.96s] through these parts that I highlighted
[4167.52s] we&#39;ll be here for 5 hours cuz it took me
[4170.159s] 5 hours to do
[4175.759s] um okay as it relates to fourth quarter
[4178.48s] with an expectation of healthier
[4180.08s] inventory positions exiting the quarter
[4182.319s] and continuation of Enterprise refresh
[4184.04s] cycle we should see Revenue growth at
[4186.0s] the high end of seasonal in the fourth
[4188.12s] quarter so this is a short-term blip
[4190.679s] until they get the new products uh and
[4193.44s] and uh a seasonal blip as it relates to
[4196.679s] the next
[4197.719s] quarter uh that you just have to kind of
[4200.32s] see through in the short term uh mobile
[4203.28s] ey Revenue so some of their
[4204.36s] non-controlling businesses weren&#39;t doing
[4206.12s] well mobile ey uh although they&#39;re it
[4209.56s] improved and they expected to get better
[4211.12s] they Altera was a train wreck that hurt
[4213.719s] them a little bit but on balance let
[4216.44s] just get to some of these start
[4217.76s] operating cash flow was 2.3 billion up
[4220.48s] approximately 3.5 billion sequentially
[4222.96s] on better working capital
[4226.44s] um gross capx of 5.7 billion was more
[4229.52s] than offset by 11.5 billion in Grants
[4231.52s] and partner contributions highlighted by
[4233.8s] Apollo&#39;s scip investment in our Ireland
[4236.0s] Factory operations resulting in adjusted
[4238.28s] free cash flow of $8.2 billion the key
[4241.28s] is Runway
[4242.56s] here uh revenues were down 1%
[4245.8s] sequentially oh we&#39;re down 1 point
[4248.04s] year-over-year but their revenues were
[4249.6s] actually up 1%
[4251.76s] sequentially Revenue was in line with
[4254.04s] the range we provided in May after
[4255.6s] receiving notice of an export license
[4257.12s] restriction which negatively impacted
[4258.6s] our business in China Intel products and
[4260.56s] Intel Foundry both delivered 4%
[4263.36s] year-over-year growth offset by
[4265.28s] headwinds in our more cyclical
[4267.08s] businesses so there&#39;s a lot of good
[4268.64s] stuff under the surface it&#39;s just most
[4270.4s] people shoot first ask questions later
[4272.52s] but they can buy it from us down the
[4274.0s] road at 80 or 100 bucks we&#39;ll be happy
[4275.96s] to help them out when they get excited
[4277.88s] and they actually start to read stuff
[4280.239s] launching Q3 launching in Q3 Intel gouty
[4284.239s] 3 will take our accelerator performance
[4286.199s] to the next level at just 2/3 of the
[4288.44s] cost of competitive offerings to put it
[4290.44s] in perspective we expect gy 3 to deliver
[4292.4s] roughly two times performance per dollar
[4294.719s] on both inference and hand and training
[4296.4s] versus h100 nvidia&#39;s h100 gy 3 has a
[4300.36s] strong ecosystem supporting Dell
[4302.36s] Technologies huet Packard Enterprise
[4304.92s] Lenovo super micro foxcon gigabyte
[4308.8s] inventech Quant Cloud technology and
[4313.04s] wion then they talk about their Intel
[4315.76s] Zeon
[4317.44s] 6 code named Sierra
[4320.88s] Forest 25% better performance versus
[4324.08s] competitors Granite rapid Rapids we&#39;ll
[4327.96s] be shipping later this quarter that&#39;s
[4329.44s] also off the 18a server product
[4332.52s] everything is falling in place 130
[4335.32s] million xeons powering data centers
[4337.159s] around the world today greater delivery
[4339.36s] performance efficiency so people forget
[4341.04s] this is a business that&#39;s still doing
[4342.76s] $50 billion a year yes margin have
[4345.679s] contracted yes they didn&#39;t get their the
[4348.08s] new products out quickly enough but they
[4350.0s] still have unbelievable franchise no one
[4352.239s] can compete with them on the aipc
[4354.4s] refresh they&#39;re going to do 40 million
[4356.56s] uh they&#39;ve already done 15 million
[4358.44s] they&#39;re going to get the GPU chips out
[4360.44s] cheaper faster better um Revenue will
[4364.36s] bounce back by
[4365.92s] Q4 and the five nodes in four years are
[4368.44s] done and then the other thing you look
[4369.92s] at adjusted free cash flow you look at
[4371.52s] some of the things that are up certainly
[4373.199s] Data Center and AI was down not good
[4376.28s] total Intel products operating income
[4378.52s] was up operating segment Revenue was up
[4381.76s] so the key things that matter desktop
[4384.48s] notebook everything was up materially it
[4386.88s] was some of these other non-core Altera
[4390.36s] the bed okay and it was down from
[4392.8s] 848 million to 361 it&#39;s in their all
[4396.84s] other category this is their stuff that
[4398.8s] they don&#39;t care about anymore like
[4400.12s] mobile ey uh and eventually they will
[4402.639s] completely divest of so if you put it in
[4407.32s] perspective uh lunar Lake our next
[4409.4s] Generation aipc which achieved
[4411.08s] production release ahead of schedule in
[4412.52s] July will be the next industrywide
[4414.199s] Catalyst for the device refresh lunar
[4415.96s] Lake delivers Superior performance at
[4418.32s] half the power with 50% better graphics
[4420.76s] performance and 40% more power
[4423.0s] efficiency versus the prior generation
[4425.239s] three time more tops gen on gen so each
[4429.239s] thing is getting better and better for
[4431.0s] lower and lower costs which will create
[4433.159s] competition in the marketplace
[4437.12s] uh
[4437.96s] so the long and the short of it is we
[4440.48s] bought more we brought our basis down
[4442.48s] now to low
[4444.12s] 24s and we&#39;ll just stick with it uh
[4446.8s] we&#39;re very happy with that we bought a
[4448.36s] meaningful amount on um some on Friday
[4452.08s] and some on Monday and a little bit
[4454.0s] today and it could go lower from here
[4456.159s] we&#39;d be perfectly fine with that uh
[4458.36s] moving on to Cooper
[4462.32s] standard so I read this Moody upgrading
[4465.76s] by the way see our historic thesis and
[4467.36s] updates for Cooper standard since May of
[4469.36s] 2022 when we entered the position at a
[4472.56s] basis in the low fives um okay so just
[4477.159s] today Cooper standard debt got upgraded
[4480.8s] okay and what they say
[4485.0s] is okay the upgrades reflect a strong
[4488.08s] Rebound in earning since 2022 that has
[4491.12s] led to significantly lower leverage
[4493.239s] improved liquidity and reduced risk of
[4495.44s] further debt restructuring under the
[4497.08s] still burdensome capital structure debt
[4499.76s] capital structure sustainable price
[4501.28s] adjustments and cost recoveries from
[4503.76s] customers a transition to a more
[4505.96s] index-based commodity input cost
[4507.96s] contracts and rigorous focus on
[4509.44s] continuous Improvement Have Been
[4511.08s] instrumental in generating improved
[4512.92s] operating results in addition headcount
[4515.159s] reductions announced in mid 2022 are
[4517.159s] expected to generate 20 to 25 million in
[4519.36s] Savings in the second half of 2024 and
[4521.84s] generate annualized Savings of at least
[4523.6s] 40 million beginning in
[4528.04s] 2 modest returns and our expectation for
[4530.76s] negative free cash flow through
[4532.52s] 2024 since 2023 the company has stemmed
[4535.679s] the margin erosion it had experienced
[4538.08s] prior from operating inefficiencies
[4539.76s] caused by lower and uneven vehicle
[4541.52s] production volumes as well as
[4543.4s] challenging cost input environment
[4545.56s] Cooper standard maintains solid Market
[4547.239s] positions in ceiling systems and Fuel
[4549.84s] and Brake Delivery Systems and fluid
[4551.56s] transfer systems where demand
[4553.6s] fundamentals are largely drivetrain
[4555.679s] agnostic a product M mix skewed towards
[4559.239s] SUVs cuvs and light trucks including
[4561.639s] content on top selling vehicle platforms
[4564.239s] help mitigate the competitive highly
[4566.0s] fragmented nature in core and end
[4568.159s] markets the stable Outlook reflects our
[4570.88s] expectation that supply chain cost
[4572.56s] reductions from lean initiatives and
[4575.0s] heightened focus on continuous
[4576.36s] Improvement will help sustain current
[4578.6s] returns ongoing rationalization of cost
[4580.92s] structure combined with higher margin
[4583.04s] new platform launches replace ing lower
[4585.44s] performing programs should help offset
[4587.12s] the impact of softening Global light
[4589.32s] vehicle production volumes and enable
[4591.08s] margin expansion through
[4594.76s] 2025 um reflects our expectation that
[4597.88s] the company will maintain adequate
[4599.76s] liquidity cash balance of about 100
[4601.84s] million even with the negative free cash
[4603.679s] flow why do they have negative free cash
[4604.88s] flow because they&#39;re now uh they elected
[4606.96s] not to do the pick they&#39;re doing cash
[4608.639s] pay on the debt contributing to cash
[4610.56s] shortfall is the expiration of the pick
[4612.4s] options on the security notes in 2025 we
[4614.679s] do anticipate the company to make
[4616.08s] progress toward generating positive and
[4618.12s] sustainable free cash flow in 2025 the
[4621.12s] undrawn 180 million asset back lending
[4624.159s] facility had availability of 173 million
[4627.6s] at June 30th 2024 the abbl was amended
[4631.719s] in 2024 extending the expiration date to
[4635.08s] 2029 and reducing the facility to 150
[4638.0s] million from 180 million beginning March
[4639.88s] of
[4641.48s] 2025 okay so that&#39;s not me and that&#39;s
[4644.96s] not Cooper standard writing all of those
[4646.88s] good words about Cooper standard that is
[4648.84s] Moody&#39;s a debt rating agency writing
[4651.48s] that about Cooper standard so what did
[4653.52s] they do they dram even though car
[4656.48s] volumes have not come up and they&#39;ve
[4658.52s] actually come down uh they were expected
[4661.04s] to be 16.1 million they&#39;re only 15.8
[4663.679s] million expected they were able to grow
[4666.8s] their margin profile so their gross
[4668.92s] profit uh was 82 million an increase of
[4671.52s] 6.7 versus the same quarter last year
[4675.6s] new business award 60.6 million but the
[4679.639s] key is we&#39;re going to get into some of
[4681.4s] these key things here as we get into the
[4683.12s] earnings called
[4684.56s] transcript um you see the fluid Handling
[4686.88s] Systems grew by about 5 million the
[4689.12s] decline
[4690.56s] in Revenue was just due
[4695.88s] to the business that they sold that was
[4698.56s] no longer included so if you add back
[4700.56s] the business that was in from the
[4701.92s] quarter that they&#39;re comparing to their
[4704.04s] revenues were up modestly even though
[4706.6s] volumes were down because of the
[4708.679s] efficiencies um and because of their
[4710.92s] improved products and improved pricing
[4714.08s] the overall guidance um stayed basically
[4718.08s] the same adjusted eida 180 to0 million
[4720.84s] versus 180 to 210 and that includes the
[4724.36s] cash pay they were deciding whether they
[4726.08s] were going to cash pay they decided to
[4727.56s] cash pay which shows they have
[4729.44s] confidence of the back half of the Year
[4731.04s] business and they&#39;ve got still got
[4733.719s] 266 million doll of liquidity you can
[4737.199s] see where they gained in adjusted eBid
[4739.56s] year on-year was their manufacturing and
[4741.96s] purchasing efficiencies volume and mix
[4744.4s] and their savings from restructuring
[4746.28s] which is going to come up even more this
[4748.0s] year and then year-to date same three
[4750.76s] areas uh improved and you can see why
[4754.0s] the sales were just a hair less 27
[4757.52s] million of the revenues 1.4 billion to
[4760.44s] 1.38 billion you lost 27 million from
[4763.88s] the tire European entire business that
[4765.679s] they sold which was
[4766.96s] non-profitable uh otherwise their net
[4769.08s] sales were actually up year
[4772.6s] on-ear uh so they&#39;ve got more cost
[4774.679s] savings coming you can see the 80% more
[4777.96s] parts for hybrids than
[4781.719s] IC and there are some key points here
[4784.12s] look at the debt maturities uh nothing
[4786.639s] until 2026 they&#39;ve got 43 million and
[4789.679s] then 2027 so they&#39;re going to refinance
[4792.12s] between now and 2027 3 years from now uh
[4795.76s] they get a couple quarters of positive
[4797.239s] free cash flow rates come down if they
[4799.44s] do 250 basis point cuts and refinance
[4802.0s] the whole thing take their debt thing
[4803.4s] down and push it out to 2030 which is
[4805.6s] all the runway they need for volumes to
[4807.28s] come back in the meantime they are
[4809.4s] operating like Simone bils on a uh on a
[4813.199s] on a walking plank uh getting gold
[4815.92s] medals because their margins continue to
[4818.0s] go up they&#39;re extracting more and more
[4820.239s] profits out of less and less volume that
[4822.44s] volume will come back um and they cut
[4825.4s] out another 16 millions of savings
[4827.04s] through Leen it initiatives and other
[4829.239s] cost programs they improved their gross
[4831.6s] margin by 100 basis points compared to
[4834.239s] the second quarter of last year and 61
[4837.239s] million of net new business
[4839.76s] Awards they
[4842.239s] outpaced um Global Automotive production
[4846.0s] which declined by
[4847.6s] 0.5% uh their revenues were actually up
[4850.76s] 1% when you back out the divesture so
[4853.88s] they outper formed by 150 basis points
[4856.28s] in terms of Topline gross profit for the
[4858.92s] second quarter
[4860.52s] was
[4862.08s] 11% 11.7% of sales this compares to
[4865.88s] 10.7% of sales in the second quarter of
[4868.159s] 2023 adjusted eida was 50.9 Million
[4871.28s] compared to 47.9 million um so that&#39;s
[4875.52s] positive they&#39;re getting more with less
[4877.32s] and wait till they have more with more
[4879.6s] is going to be a big deal um
[4884.8s] despite lower
[4887.84s] sales despite lower sales our business
[4890.239s] was actually more efficient as grow
[4892.56s] gross profit increased to 144.5 million
[4896.6s] for the first half of the year and gross
[4898.48s] profit margin improved by 90 basis
[4901.719s] points versus the first half of
[4903.56s] 2023 adjusted evit for the half was 80.3
[4906.56s] Million up 33% versus the prior year 6
[4912.12s] months and the technical rubber fature
[4915.08s] was 15
[4918.6s] million $9 million of improvement for
[4921.28s] the
[4922.48s] quarter
[4925.12s] manufacturing liquidity 267
[4932.04s] million
[4934.76s] okay this is very important um and I&#39;ll
[4937.76s] probably see them at JP Morgan on
[4939.8s] Thursday if I can get to a flight
[4943.08s] afterwards it we got to move some things
[4944.88s] around we&#39;ll see uh let me assure you
[4946.92s] that we&#39;re 100% focused on this task
[4948.44s] they&#39;re talking about deleveraging and
[4949.96s] refinancing given our leadership
[4952.0s] frameless uh ceiling system growing at
[4954.52s] 30% kager for the next 5 years go
[4956.88s] through this at the hedge fund tips.com
[4959.159s] there&#39;s so much amazing stuff in here I
[4961.52s] I saw the headline I was like H that&#39;s a
[4963.0s] mediocre quarter and then as I read
[4964.679s] through it I was pretty excited with
[4966.48s] what I saw and particularly in the
[4968.84s] question and answer
[4970.76s] period uh was especially exciting
[4975.96s] cuz he said hey wanted to follow up on
[4977.76s] Mike&#39;s questions on the margins I guess
[4979.56s] at least 10% EIT a margin without volume
[4982.52s] growth doing the math that would imply
[4983.88s] 270 million of eida exiting 2025 am I
[4987.159s] doing the math right Jeffrey Edwards
[4989.32s] says yes you&#39;re doing the math right I
[4991.08s] mean if they do 270 million of eida
[4993.8s] exiting 2025 remember going back to
[4997.8s] 2027 uh 2017 when they earned $7 a share
[5001.44s] they were doing about 400 million
[5004.639s] you know we&#39;re starting to knock on the
[5006.639s] door here as the quarters move and once
[5008.48s] the volume ramps up to 16 16 and a half
[5011.88s] with all of the cuts and the pricing
[5013.96s] agreements that they have in place I
[5016.04s] think when they&#39;re doing similar volumes
[5017.92s] they&#39;re going to wind up doing a lot
[5019.28s] more than the seven that they were able
[5021.88s] to do so uh this and they continue to
[5026.96s] emphasize getting to double digit return
[5029.56s] on invested Capital doubleit digit
[5032.639s] adjusted eida margins
[5035.679s] and everything else so that&#39;s that fear
[5037.84s] and greed down to 21 that&#39;s times to be
[5039.92s] a buyer not a seller uh and you&#39;ll
[5042.48s] probably get a few opportunities over
[5044.04s] the coming
[5045.28s] days moving along earnings growth 11.5%
[5049.36s] earnings growth versus 88.9% estimated
[5052.96s] that&#39;s not really what you see during
[5055.0s] recessions ladies and gentlemen Som rule
[5057.08s] or not which is why we R remain
[5059.12s] constructive as well as estimates have
[5061.32s] actually gone up in the last few weeks
[5064.48s] over 1% since January 1st so uh for
[5068.639s] those of you who don&#39;t like the AMA
[5070.6s] section we&#39;ll see you next week for
[5072.719s] everyone who likes the ask me anything
[5074.719s] question let&#39;s get right down to it we
[5077.04s] don&#39;t have too many this week cu the
[5079.04s] call is so
[5081.52s] early um but we&#39;re going to cover the
[5083.52s] ones we have we do have like 10 ultas at
[5086.4s] 12 times earnings this is from John five
[5089.4s] very cheap and buying back shares
[5091.52s] looking to expand International any
[5093.08s] thoughts on looking into this business
[5095.159s] yeah I I&#39;ve looked at it and looked at
[5099.76s] it and looked at it and I think this is
[5101.56s] going to be an error of omission where I
[5104.92s] just don&#39;t get
[5108.719s] involved because when all is said and
[5111.08s] done it&#39;s still a bricks and mortar
[5113.88s] retailer
[5115.48s] um but yeah I mean it&#39;s getting to that
[5118.159s] point where it&#39;s attractive you look at
[5119.76s] the free cash flow is kind of holding in
[5121.96s] there revenues are going up return on
[5124.92s] capital is strong margins are holding in
[5127.88s] so would I take a punt on it I think
[5130.8s] you&#39;re probably okay
[5133.159s] but you know at the most you know over
[5136.84s] the next three or four years you&#39;re
[5138.199s] probably barely looking at a double so
[5140.6s] when something&#39;s not
[5143.28s] like super easy and straightforward to
[5145.8s] me and they return over 3 four years is
[5148.84s] less than a double I just immediately
[5150.92s] take a pass but I&#39;ll take a look at a
[5152.639s] couple of these things let&#39;s take a look
[5153.92s] at
[5155.119s] cash
[5162.0s] flow so it&#39;s fine they&#39;re doing a
[5164.48s] billion dollars of cash flow let&#39;s take
[5167.0s] a look at their income statement
[5169.48s] revenues have been flattish but they&#39;re
[5172.36s] going up in the right direction balance
[5174.679s] sheets probably fine 520 million of cash
[5184.719s] is this possible they have no long-term
[5186.56s] debt with uh retail
[5190.8s] stores wow that&#39;s pretty
[5194.0s] amazing um turn on
[5196.36s] Capital I don&#39;t know you know this has
[5198.679s] been on the watch list for a
[5203.84s] while I think you just have to
[5206.119s] understand what&#39;s the growth profile
[5208.0s] moving forward John cuz there&#39;s others
[5209.6s] like Sally Beauty that are really in
[5211.92s] trouble um that haven&#39;t been doing well
[5214.28s] well so if you can understand its
[5215.96s] competitive
[5217.08s] Advantage the and how they&#39;re going to
[5219.92s] sustain that I think you might have
[5221.32s] something here and it might be worth an
[5223.44s] investment um but you know just looking
[5227.28s] at the
[5228.36s] numbers take a look at the
[5233.679s] margins margins are holding in they&#39;re
[5236.239s] down a little bit but if you can get
[5238.52s] comfort with their competitive advantage
[5240.119s] and understand why are they actually
[5242.04s] down almost 50% in the last 6 months uh
[5247.04s] and feel good about that also check
[5249.88s] comparable store sales versus uh overall
[5253.08s] sales that that that could probably be a
[5254.96s] tell as well you know Five Below
[5256.639s] expanded a lot of stores uh to grow
[5259.6s] sales but their comp store sales were
[5261.639s] down and that might be the problem with
[5263.44s] Ulta also people are worried a little
[5265.08s] bit about the consumer so if you can get
[5267.239s] comfort about all those things you might
[5269.08s] have enough margin of safety to make an
[5270.76s] investment here uh and uh I think you
[5273.6s] did pretty good work on that one let&#39;s
[5275.56s] go to Jay
[5276.8s] oare regular listener second time AMA
[5279.52s] questioner with the possible topping of
[5281.32s] Chip stocks like Invidia what do you
[5283.0s] mean possible topping it&#39;s down 40% in
[5286.0s] like six weeks um and AMD would you
[5290.119s] agree that the next big chip stock will
[5291.88s] be an energy or data center company uh
[5295.0s] since they&#39;re power and run massive
[5296.6s] computational power i&#39; play it with
[5298.159s] natural gas J that&#39;s what I would play
[5300.0s] it with I I&#39;d play the energy I wouldn&#39;t
[5301.84s] even go there and I think the the chip
[5304.119s] ship companies with the large enough
[5305.32s] margin of safety like Intel the way I
[5307.04s] would play that Jay I think you&#39;re your
[5309.04s] thinking is right the way we&#39;re playing
[5310.36s] it is through com stock on the natural
[5311.96s] gas side and Intel on the chip side Jack
[5315.0s] McCarthy thanks for the great content
[5316.719s] every week was waiting a long time to
[5318.719s] finally be able to ask you this
[5321.199s] uh but do you think now that the bank of
[5323.679s] Japan has finally had an interest rate
[5325.44s] hike that the Chinese Yuan will have a
[5326.84s] massive rally yeah it&#39;s already
[5328.56s] happening uh which automatically means
[5330.48s] Baba will be bid yes in my opinion that
[5334.32s] was the most important Catalyst which
[5335.639s] had to happen just wanted to see if you
[5337.32s] see it the same way or we&#39;re missing yes
[5339.0s] we&#39;ve covered it a hundred times over
[5341.119s] over three months so yes it&#39;s happening
[5342.96s] Jack uh so let&#39;s hope we get a good
[5345.119s] earnings report and we can finally be
[5346.639s] Off to the Races so yeah thanks for
[5348.48s] hanging in there and these things all
[5350.239s] work out sooner or later as long as the
[5353.199s] framework is correct
[5356.44s] um uh LOM
[5360.0s] vanam is asking about process process is
[5363.88s] u basically a way to buy 10cent at a
[5365.88s] discount the problem is they&#39;ve been
[5367.6s] selling 10cent so I wouldn&#39;t mess with
[5369.719s] it if you want if you like 10cent just
[5371.32s] buy 10cent Jim Jones uh if you want to
[5374.239s] exposure to natural gas and coal what
[5375.719s] would you look at uh we own com stock
[5377.8s] resources Jerry Jones is our partner own
[5379.76s] 66% of the equity also owns the Dallas
[5382.639s] Cowboys and he thinks that com stock is
[5384.4s] more valuable than the Cowboys based on
[5386.56s] past interviews Mark and and based on
[5388.56s] how we think about the reserves we agree
[5390.8s] Mark mayelo thanks for everything
[5392.639s] learned more here than all the books
[5394.199s] podcast I&#39;ve studied what are your
[5396.04s] thoughts on Walgreens stock is their
[5397.56s] debt and Lees too large can they manage
[5399.04s] to comeb back I think they&#39;re probably
[5401.0s] going to be the last man man standing
[5402.679s] but it&#39;s a garbage business and I don&#39;t
[5404.639s] I really don&#39;t want to do it at any
[5406.159s] price so I&#39;m going to pass on that but I
[5408.36s] think you might you
[5409.92s] know I think we&#39;ve covered that one a
[5412.199s] couple
[5413.239s] times um and I think it
[5416.28s] will probably work but you know this
[5420.119s] stuff with
[5421.6s] it&#39;s revenue&#39;s going up
[5424.639s] cash flows negative margins
[5428.0s] negative I mean this is one of those
[5430.08s] that are better for a trade than for
[5433.04s] owning like right Right Aid is bankrupt
[5436.76s] I think this might be the last man
[5438.119s] standing I just don&#39;t want to be in the
[5439.44s] space there&#39;s too many counter wins with
[5442.0s] the pharmacy benefit managers with
[5443.8s] Amazon with direct to Consumer I I just
[5446.239s] don&#39;t want to play there they used to
[5448.44s] make all their money selling cigarettes
[5449.96s] now now that&#39;s gone Christian Dy SIU air
[5455.44s] they&#39;re doop and LCC Air Asia groups s
[5458.96s] suck at
[5460.76s] hammered uh only company did not need to
[5464.199s] restructure The Debs last thing I want
[5465.92s] to buy is an airliner in Asia but let
[5467.88s] let me take a look um SIU if I want to
[5472.0s] buy a garbage Airline I&#39;ll buy one in
[5473.84s] America let&#39;s say SIU
[5481.08s] air I don&#39;t know can I get the regular
[5483.36s] ticker here C
[5492.56s] Ebu yeah massive negative free cash flow
[5495.679s] I I don&#39;t want to mess with this let me
[5497.159s] see about the
[5505.239s] debt okay 250 million of cash
[5514.92s] billion dollars of
[5526.04s] debt negative half a billion of free
[5528.28s] cash flow no this is a train wreck I I&#39;d
[5530.199s] pass Christian at any price
[5533.96s] Jacob what do you think about Intel
[5535.96s] after the latest quarterly results I
[5537.56s] didn&#39;t realized they reported um let me
[5539.8s] look into that kidding actually we just
[5542.08s] covered it thank you for the great
[5543.4s] question
[5544.88s] um all right David Martin found you on
[5548.08s] Tik toks a few months back and have
[5549.48s] become an avid listener podcast thanks
[5550.96s] for helping us out us very sub one
[5553.239s] million accounts curious to hear your
[5555.239s] thoughts about adding to my positions I
[5556.88s] totally understand dollar cost averaging
[5558.4s] at lower prices but when how or and or
[5561.08s] would you add to a position once it
[5562.44s] starts to move up um never that&#39;s me I
[5565.92s] buy down not up I buy red days not green
[5568.56s] days uh if you need an actual stock we
[5571.56s] can use CPS as an example no I just buy
[5573.56s] CP PS when it&#39;s red and I have cash
[5575.679s] period that&#39;s very simple uh I never buy
[5578.92s] it when it&#39;s going up or or green uh and
[5582.199s] we got plenty so we&#39;re happy with our
[5584.08s] positioning we&#39;re happy with our basis
[5586.199s] and now we&#39;re just going to let John
[5587.84s] Edwards and
[5590.0s] team Jeff Edwards and John vanis uh work
[5593.52s] their magic continue to execute until
[5596.119s] the volume I mean they&#39;ve basically got
[5597.88s] this thing running like such a
[5599.36s] well-oiled machine at such low volumes
[5601.96s] that they could be cash flow positive
[5603.32s] next year assuming no growth in volumes
[5605.48s] when volumes are going to grow when the
[5607.56s] average car on the road is 13.5 years
[5610.56s] and the average Millennial is 33 years
[5612.92s] old that&#39;s when they buy they buy the
[5614.719s] most cars and dishwashers with for those
[5617.119s] of you who have asked me about whirlpool
[5619.119s] and homes and baby stuff between 33 and
[5622.56s] 40 and this time will be no different
[5625.0s] and they&#39;re going to be the beneficiary
[5626.48s] so fact they can go cash flow positive
[5628.48s] in the next year assuming no volume
[5630.679s] growth when volume growth is going to
[5632.92s] come back uh rates are going to come
[5635.04s] lower inventories are going to go up uh
[5638.159s] oems are going to start to give
[5639.36s] incentives volumes are going to start to
[5640.92s] go through the roof margins for oems
[5642.84s] will go down but um that all we care
[5646.08s] about is volumes and they will be a key
[5648.119s] beneficiary so uh hope that answers your
[5650.719s] question we&#39;ll be back next week same
[5652.679s] time same place in the mean uh no
[5655.28s] actually we&#39;ll be back at our normal
[5656.719s] time normal place in the meantime make
[5658.92s] it a great one thanks for tuning in have
