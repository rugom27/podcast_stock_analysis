  "cleaned_transcript": "### HEADLINES_AND_NEWS\nlot of great stuff to cover this week and doing it a bit early because I&#39;ve got to travel down to Virginia for the girls zones championship and got pushed back a day but we&#39;ll get there first and foremost want to congratulate Mimi uh we do family first then we get\n\n### MEDIA_APPEARANCE_RECAP\nfirst I want to thank Liz Clayman and Jake Mack for having me on the Clayman countdown on Friday with Nick timos the FED Whisperer himself from the Wall Street Journal covered a lot of important stuff here including the Som rule the labor report we're going to listen in now a rate cut but a jumbo or super siiz rate cut in September Nick timos is the Wall Street journal's all things fed correspondent who understands the fed's thinking better than just about anybody and Trader Tom Hayes has been scrutinizing which stocks maybe look like a Buy in this selloff and Nick I'll start with you three days ago fed funds Futures fully expected a September rate cut of about 25 basis points right but saw only a 10% odds of a larger 50 basis point easing look at fed funds Futures right now one ugly jobs report it skyrockets to near 70% for a 50 basis point cut what do you think chair Powell is mulling right now and is the market way ahead of itself versus what the FED is thinking well Liz is the market ahead of itself I mean probably not but there's the market is sort of assuming that the current trends continue uh the FED doesn't really have to make up its mind for another six or seven weeks right they don't meet for another seven weeks so I'm sure we'll hear from fed officials uh you know a lot over those six or seven weeks but they don't really have to make up their mind now about whether the first cut uh will be 25 or 50 that's obviously where the debate is going to be what I'm hearing today from a lot of analysts is okay you can do 25 at every meeting there are three meetings left this year and that's probably locked in now as a base case for the FED there are a number of people though who have said you need interest rates to get closer to neutral sooner you need to be closer to 4% by the end of this year and so you saw JP Morgan and City Bank put out calls uh this morning for 50 basis point Cuts in September and November and another quarter point in December I don't think you're going to hear fed officials talking about that right now but the next meeting is still a ways away so you know they'll have another jobs report before that meeting they'll have we'll be able to see a lot more uh than we can today June July September November of 2022 you saw jumbo rate hikes so we know that the FED isn't afraid of making big moves of 75 basis points even but the question is now will City and JP Morgan be right they are both claiming that September and November will see um I guess a 50 basis point cut Tom uh not only is there no rotation out of Mega cap Tech and into the Russell the Russell is getting absolutely slammed biggest percentage loser here what's behind the Panic selling there and if there's any money leaving and going into somewhere where do you think it's going well the Market's afraid of two things Liz first off is is a recession because the S rule was triggered today that's when the unemployment rate 3-month moving average moves up a half a percent higher than the lowest three-month moving average 12 months before that's a mouthful but the markets are worried about a recession that's why small caps are down that's why yields are down the second thing that's happening is the unwind of the Japanese carry trade the Nik is down 20% that's a lot more than the NASDAQ and that's because the bank of Japan has been the global liquidity provider while the West Titan to fight inflation but the FED has not stepped in now that the bank of Japan is tightening so you have this liquidity dislocation pocket and guess what's happening it's a big unwinding of the most crowded trades because liquidity is drying up and the most crowded trade as you know was the Magnificent 7 and the second most crowded trade was short the Japanese Yen so with yields lower what we're looking at Liz is dividend payers that's where the opportunity is right now yeah opportunity in door Dash it's up 7% we do have a little bits of green on the screen here uh Nick before we go here as you're looking at this Market action and specifically the Panic that's in the vix I mean that that's just sort of a one-day situation but it does measure some concern about the markets do you get the sense that the FED is guided At All by these market minations and spasms one day movs Liz no but I think what what you what I'm paying attention to\n\n### MEDIA_APPEARANCE_RECAP\nwell the Market&#39;s afraid of two things Liz first off is is a recession because the S rule was triggered today that&#39;s when the unemployment rate 3-month moving average moves up a half a percent higher than the lowest three-month moving average 12 months before that&#39;s a mouthful but the markets are worried about a recession that&#39;s why small caps are down that&#39;s why yields are down the second thing that&#39;s happening is the unwind of the Japanese carry trade the Nik is down 20% that&#39;s a lot more than the NASDAQ and that&#39;s because the bank of Japan has been the global liquidity

Yen so with yields lower what we&#39;re looking at Liz is dividend payers that&#39;s where the opportunity is right now yeah opportunity in door Dash it&#39;s up 7% we do have a little bits of green on the screen here uh Nick before we go here as you&#39;re looking at this Market action and specifically the Panic that&#39;s in the vix I mean that that&#39;s just sort of a one-day situation but it does measure some concern about the markets do you get the sense that the FED is guided At All by these market minations and spasms one day movs Liz no but I think what what you what I&#39;m paying attention to here is  if this is sustained does it change sentiment if you change sentiment you change business&#39;s plans to invest they slash investment budgets they decide to fire workers uh labor demand is clearly weaker than it was some months ago and so what I would worry about\n\nthey slash investment budgets they decide to fire workers uh labor demand is clearly weaker than it was some months ago and so what I would worry about\n\n### MEDIA_APPEARANCE_RECAP\nand then I had the pleasure to join Charles Payne on Monday to talk about the Japanese currency trade Japanese carry trade unwind some picks and a lot more thanks to Nick Palazo and Charles for having me on we&#39;re going to listen in now all right so the overarching rationale for the FED not the cut rates is that it would Panic the markets and listen I get that in most cases in life you don&#39;t want to panic but I got to tell you I have personally been in positions and play uh where those knee-jerk moves saved my life right and and also times it saved me financially from a lot of Heartache I&#39;m going to Bringing out great Hill Capital chairman uh Thomas Hayes Thomas so I know you&#39;re one of those study Edy guys check out your posture right just cool and easy like a modern day Paul Newman right but uh you know it&#39;s it&#39;s like the whole steady crowd doesn&#39;t want the FED to overreact by the same token though the markets are pushing them around right and of course you have to wonder how much things have changed since the moves from the bank of Jaan I mean the feds doesn&#39;t just have to deal within the context of us but it&#39;s also got other central banks around the world that are making aggressive moves yeah this is a big deal I think the carry trade onwi is actually pretty important you had the Nik drop 25% in a very short amount of time basically what you have is the funding currency the Japanese Yen institutions were borrowing that for free to buy the most crowded trades the Magnificent Sev so as the cost of capital went up they had to return that capital and unwind the The Magnificent Seven trades so it&#39;s like the FED as the bank of Japan hiked had the opportunity to cut to make up that that ill liquidity they didn&#39;t do that so where&#39;s the liquidity going to come from we&#39;ve had 35 Central Bank Cuts globally in the past 3 months the last time we had that many Cuts was in 2020 April 2020 we had like 95 have we ever had this sort of carry tray relationship with any I mean does do we have like that with the bank of Pakistan or something like that you know what I mean like not being I&#39;m being a little fous here but I&#39;ve never heard of this sort of relationship where like Japanese households were buying buying our tech stocks and buying our treasuries by the way and who buys that now yeah so uh this was pretty big in 2006 and 2007 when you had the lowc cost of capital with the Japanese Yen it&#39;s it&#39;s reworked itself I think now you&#39;ve probably going to find out one or two weeks from now you&#39;ve been around maybe a couple funds blew up over the weekend this felt like abnormal uh selling that we saw structural selling which creates opportunity if you have cash to deploy so let&#39;s talk about that opportunity right now you say we&#39;ve got a declining rate environment declining US dollar and there&#39;s specific areas that historically really work out that&#39;s right uh first and foremost dividend payers that&#39;s nice in a day like today you get a little bit of safety you get a little bit bit of yield while you wait but with lowering rates people want the yield and they&#39;re going to move back from money markets into dividend payers for sure cyclicals we&#39;re seeing the earnings growth of the UNM magnificent 493 accelerate while the Magnificent 7 decelerates cuz margins are compress uh compressing from the cap expend then small caps started to go and they just got whacked last week they&#39;ll be back because the earnings growth is going to go from 4% this year to 177% next year even as is a little less also after the first cut they outperform large caps by 11% in the first 12 months and then International guess which group did the best in the last 5 days China China was only down a few percent while you know the N was down 25% would you buy China specifically or would you buy like I how would you go about this look I&#39;ve been bagged in this stock for like a year and a half I own Alibaba it&#39;s a huge company a huge out the cheapest AI play in the world it&#39;s done nothing for a year and a half I think this is ready to roll they&#39;re going to report on August 15th so I like the environment with a weaker dollar with rates coming down and with the hot money coming out of Japan and back into China could be an opportunity uh we&#39;ve got a minute to go enough time to go over some of your def individual ideas that you like here CCI uh Crown crown castle was on with you uh earlier this Stock&#39;s come up a little bit but you still get a 5.5% yield uh it&#39;s got 40,000 Towers they&#39;re selling the small sale fiber business to delever the balance sheet new CEO Steve MOS I&#39;ve been waiting for this stock to go to the Moon though for like 10 years like yeah it&#39;s gone up like from 100 to 115 you collected a yield in the meantime as rates come down it&#39;ll stay up there&#39;s been doing pretty well lately yeah brought brought to you by spam right I mean they got spam they got Skippy they got Planters this is a steady grower got beat down 3 and half% % yield we like this particularly in a defensive environment right now until we figure out what&#39;s going on and then backer medical supplies medical devices 3.2% yield they&#39;re spinning off the kidney business it&#39;ll rate the multiple back from 10 to a normalized 15 multiple as that gets done toward the end of the year all right so the bottom line though these are defensive you&#39;re getting paid you&#39;re holding quality names you probably sleep better at night that&#39;s right we&#39;ll get offensive again very soon but not just yet all right let me know when thanks a lot Thomas all right folks so um\n### QUOTES_OF_THE_WEEK\nmy next guest and we&#39;re back and then want to get to the quote of the week from SE Seth claran successful investors tend to be unemotional allowing the greed and fear of others to play into their hands by the way this was a great week a great example for that by having confidence in their own analysis and judgment and like we always say know what you own uh they respond to Market forces not with blind emotion but with calculated reason successful investors for example Dem demonstrate caution in frothy markets and steadfast conviction in panicky ones indeed the very way an investor views the market and its price fluctuations is a key factor in his or her ultimate investment success or failure so those of you who have been with us for a while know that we live by this philosophy and many of you have been picking it up for yourselves and benefiting accordingly and then final quote of the week is from Warren Buffett great investment opportunities come around when excellent companies are surrounded by unusual circumstances that cause the stock to be misappreciation first name wrong uh was on Charles Payne saying This Time It&#39;s Different because immigration and covid hiring skew the numbers we will see if that&#39;s the case or not we tend to be in that camp that there same thing with the inverted yield curve two years ago people were saying the curve is inverted we&#39;re going to get a recession I said hey we already had the recession q1 and Q2 of 2022 was a technical recession uh and I think this will prove to be the case as well provided the FED steps in quickly enough and gets that done because these jobless claims numbers and unemployment numbers are moving up the other thing that happened on the jobs report was that more people entered the workforce which is also a positive thing which is why wages are coming down uh and unemployment is going up because there&#39;s a new supply of labor which we&#39;ve been waiting for for uh the excess savings to run out so people had to go to work by the way this is my beautiful hedge fund tips mug from my friends in Dallas and as always opinions not advice go to hedge fund tips.com and click on terms we deal exclusively with accredited investors and qualified institutions uh check with your financial advisor before you do anything at all labor productivity is going up unit labor costs are going down you can see here Wards Automotive Sales going up that&#39;s a positive thing we&#39;re going to talk about Cooper standard today pretty exciting actually after going through every single word of the transcript and the release uh a lot of good things happening in the way they&#39;re operating and how they&#39;ll benefit\n### HEADLINES_AND_NEWS\nBank of England cutting foreign investors dumped most Japan stocks since September of 2022 this number was as of August 2nd I&#39;m sure this was probably the most Japan stocks ever we&#39;ve been saying forever don&#39;t get sucked into Japan it&#39;s now down 25 fell 25% in 3 days or four days the uh topics did and the Nik similar amounts um economic surprise index uh UK is going up we like that recovery story we&#39;ll talk a little bit about gxo not we&#39;ll maybe go into more detail with gxo next week and what did private clients buy last week before uh Japan collapsed is they bought Japanese equities at the top and got their faces ripped off August does well in election years we&#39;re still of that camp which we covered last week we think we&#39;re going to see strength into the first cut which is late September and then we&#39;re going to see uh sell the news into the election and a year-end rally is our base case this is the chart that I referenced with Charles on making money with Charles pain on Fox Business we there&#39;s a uh back lag of global liquidity coming to Bear the most Global Central Bank Cuts since May of 2020 did you want to be a buyer or a seller of equities in May 2020 you wanted to be a massive buyer so we&#39;ve had 35 Cuts in the last 3 months uh in May of 2022 we had 92 Cuts globally and in April 2009 we had 76 Cuts so I would imagine in the next month two months three months we&#39;re going to see this up to 60 Cuts around the globe which is the perfect environment to be a buyer not a seller of equities uh that was the NASDAQ I think corrected 15% Peak to trough we were fortunate as you guys can go back to the tapes uh of taking a bunch of the uh alphabet and Amazon reluctantly by the way saying we hate taking this but we&#39;re going to have a chance to buy it a lot lower are we buying it back yet no uh but um we&#39;re keeping a close eye on it there just too many other great things to do uh yeah 15% NASDAQ draw down I think that wasn&#39;t even as of let&#39;s see yeah uh Russell gave back some gains too so that happened but keep in mind the outperformance the 12 months following the first cut number one number two this is was kind of a global deleveraging scare uh credit unwind we&#39;re probably going to find out as I shared with uh Charles that a couple of funds blew up from margin calls and over leverage over the weekend and this stuff will get back to normal The Narrative will get back to the normal why because it&#39;s underpinned by earnings and uh uh small cap earnings are going to grow dramatically faster than large cap uh over the next 12 months which is supportive of them outperforming after the first cut as you can see the Russell fell a lot less than the NASDAQ vix got up to 65 which is normally a sign of massive capitulation on Monday and um it looks that way but don&#39;t be shocked if there are some after effects for the next few days there&#39;ll be funds blowing up Margin Call liquidating so you&#39;re going to have some aftershocks just accept that use it as the opportunity but on balance we remain constructive for the next six to seven weeks uh cyclicals versus defensives you know they got smoked out here&#39;s the Nik and it fell a lot more than this by the way this is from August 5th um unbelievable this is remember all through this period I was saying do not get trapped everyone wanted wanted to buy Japanese equities hand over fist their demographics are crap they have no the Japan is where China will be five years from now okay but we&#39;re going to get a parabolic move in China before then is our base case and the unwinding of the Yen carry trade and getting all this hot Chinese money out of Japan uh is going to be very positive for Chinese equities the Yuan strength positive the uh bond yield starting to go up positive all the things that we need to see China and even CH uh China Services PMI went up this week which was positive to see we&#39;re going to see some earnings in the next few weeks which is also positive Nik volatility over 75 unbelievable Yen absolutely collapsing remember all this period here you were all probably thinking for two months I was saying the yen is going to you want to get long the Yen you to get long the end and short the dollar and this was one of the biggest moves in history that we just saw\n### TECHNICAL_CHARTS\nand it&#39;s setting things up for everything we need to do that&#39;s the Som rule that we already discussed three-month moving anyway we we know what that is um go back to the Liz claiming tape twoyear inflation swap 10year Break Even rate inflation break evens are now nearing 2% which mean means inflation is not only not a problem but deflation is starting to come into view if they don&#39;t move aggressive ly or they don&#39;t move quickly I think all they really need to do is be doish like you saw with ghouls be yesterday if something breaks will fix it which is kind of not the ideal strategy uh but da also said that she&#39;s not worried about it but we&#39;re still going to give accommodative policy very soon average hourly warning earnings collapsing this is what I talk about when I talk about demographics India too early The Sweet Spot is 30 to 40 when the bulk of the population is 35 to 40 you get the most amount of equity gains and economic gains in the shortest amount of time because that&#39;s when people spend the most in their life cycle China you&#39;ve got that right now uh but as you look out five years from now they&#39;re all going to be over 40 in ch India you&#39;re not even close there India is going to be what you want to play after you take all your profits in China five years out and us is in a great situation also with a ton of millennials at 35 and that will continue to be pretty strong uh throughout 2050 and Beyond we have a pretty good situation because of immigration because of Millennials Etc birth rate is better than other places India I think is going to be the best place to invest probably from 20 30 to 2050 I think you&#39;ll make the most amount of money in the shortest amount of time in India I think it&#39;s too early right now and they need a lot more development uh summer olympics of course the United States dominated Wake Me Up When SE September Ends August both normally and in election year does fine September is when things get spotty worst month of the year which is why if we get the strength we expect into September that&#39;s when we would start to put on some tactical Hedges tactical shorts raise some cash to buy in the hole in September and early October head of the election when fear is acute S&P 500 returns following 5% pullbacks uh this shows the percent of time positive is more than uh 80% 6 months out 85% 6 months out 80% 3 months out 70% one month out the median return one month out is 3% um 3 months out is 5% 6 months out is 7% and 12 months out is 11% so they&#39;re basically saying buy the dip this is from macro charts showing that basically the put call skew got so lopsided this is usually times you want to be a buyer not a seller then 5% pullbacks occur more than three times a year on average so this is pretty normal stuff 10% pullbacks occur one time per year on average this is all data going back to 1930 sometimes when you burden yourself with the facts it puts things in perspective and puts you at ease during these opportunities 15% Corrections occur every other year on average and 20% pullbacks occur every 3 to four years on average which is consistent with um with recessions now we&#39;ve already had 2 20% pullbacks in the last four years so we&#39;re do to not have one for some time we had one in 2020 and we had one in 2022 both times we had recession so we&#39;re actually pulled forward a lot of recession and 20% drawbacks therefore we should only be looking more likely for our average 10% a year which we got more than that in the NASDAQ I think we came close Peak to trough in the SNP and um and the 5% pullbacks that those are going to come three times a year no matter what you do I think we&#39;ve had two already we&#39;ll probably get the third one in September October this was an excerpt from an article in bar uh Bloomberg China becoming

from slomer this came out today so you can see in the scheme of things this is not a very big correction so does it pull back all the way down to 4500 that&#39;s what his chart would imply I&#39;m not of that camp I think that this is going to be uh more subdued in nature quick acute deleveraging among leverag funds and um you know maybe that that becomes in play in September October but I don&#39;t think it&#39;s going to come in now this is the monthly seasonality since 1928 that we were referencing you can see here September is the month that we should start to be more concerned election year versus non-election year uh you can see the correction here he&#39;s pointing to 4950 maybe maybe that that&#39;ll be the aftershocks I&#39;m not really in that camp yet I think earnings have been too strong but let&#39;s let&#39;s see what happens sometimes it has nothing to do with earnings it&#39;s just uh margin calls that throw people off this other chart he has takes it down to 5071 NASDAQ already came down to 50 50% retrace trement and um 20,000 to 177,000 so yeah we covered that 18% on the mag 7 40% on Nvidia and let&#39;s see if there&#39;s anything else so small caps this you know it look felt like a lot it&#39;s not really a lot it&#39;s bouncing off this 50-day moving average I think it&#39;s already made its move and this can start to work higher cup and handle back up to new highs uh we like that story supported by earnings not by hope or by chart patterns uh the topics that&#39;s down more than this that&#39;s 81 why does you have an 81 chart on an 86 book that makes that&#39;s lazy uh this probably got all the way down to here let me just see here t o p iix oh n okay n so yeah it got down to 42,000 to 30 31,000 that&#39;s a big drop and now it bounced uh topics weekly that was as of yeah this is a better view I think he just forgot to update that chart this here shows that all the year&#39;s gains have been erased in Tokyo the Hang sang broke out of this downward Trend spiked higher earlier in the year checked back now it&#39;s starting to go back up that&#39;s actually a very nice retracement let&#39;s see how that plays out with earnings uh 10-year yield collapsed down to 370 and change remember we said 375 as a matter of fact we did take off a lot of our TLT on Friday and Monday when it just puked out we had huge profits on some of those uh call spreads and uh made many multiples on those and um I think this will Trend lower but it&#39;s due for a bounce here so we may just put that back on sometime in September and make uh take get two bites at that Apple uh this fell off his chart which is pretty wild this is what we&#39;d expecting looking at the dollar all these things why we continue to emphasize it because they&#39;re key for the China trade uh all falling into place the dollar is weakening collapsed here the Yen all the hot money coming out of Japan Canadian dollar don&#39;t worry you Looney you lunatics Looney loonatics uh Canadian Looney the can Canadian dollar will appreciate against the US dollar coming to a theater near you that&#39;s going to be a great trade uh same thing probably with the Australian dollar as China picks back up probably same with copper\n### MISCELLANEOUS\nuh let&#39;s see if there other any other key charts we want to cover here with him semiconductor equipment huge drop Vago Scott&#39;s Miracle Grow we&#39;ve covered that a few times we do like that stock um all the utilities have absolutely rallied we&#39;ve been talking utilities forever now the hedge funds are getting into them they&#39;re due for a pullback you watch what happens with those uh so if you&#39;ve run with the utilities that we&#39;ve been talking about take some profits now uh and you can probably read those in September and that&#39;s that on that front let&#39;s finish up these other charts spreads blew out a little bit yesterday Global pmis is going up manufacturing that&#39;s good Financial stress going up from that deleveraging yesterday delinquencies going up modestly but not extreme relative to history whe except for student loans because they&#39;ve all a lot of them have been forgiven auto loans are going up uh that will also be helped by lower rates is financing autos which is a big deal earning surprise have been better than the pre-co average Q2 earnings surprise to the upside by 5.5% uh that is better better than plus 3.7% preco average earnings growth was uh 15.3% X energy and financials that&#39;s pretty big uh regular earnings growth was 11.5% all in we&#39;re going to talk about that at the end uh Monday&#39;s vix closing level ranks in the 96 percentile since 1999 some level of capitulation and margin calling going on there which is why we don&#39;t use much leverage um and the largest calendar year Peak to trough S&amp;P draw down uh just about hit looks like it hit about 9% probably probably Futures hit 10% would be my expectation if you do from overnight charts uh you would see that it actually got to a little correction there gxo earnings second quarter Revenue increased 19% year-over-year to a record 2.8 billion with Organic Revenue growth of 2% they signed new business wins of approximately 270 million in annualized revenue and got a sales pipeline increase to the 12-month high of 2.3 billion they completed the the Winton acquisition in the UK which we had talked about uh all of this is positive they generated 115 million of cash flows from operations compared to 61 Million last year and 31 million of free cash flow compared with 3 million of free cash flow last year same quarter that&#39;s a big deal remember this is troughing it the whole world was Goods uh from 2020 to 2022 lot of pull forward then it was uh working through inventory iies from 23 and 24 and now they&#39;re back on track with a more balanced situation which is goods and services which will be positive for their growth going forward so just had to get this plugged in so we don&#39;t lose power there we go uh so we&#39;ll go into gxo the conference call Etc next week we&#39;ve got other ones that we spent more time on for this week\n### FEATURED_COMPANY_DEEP_DIVES\nVF Corp the name of the game with VF Corp is the fact that they&#39;re deleveraging their balance sheets the sales are still down they did have some big turnarounds in

China Allin but it was by brand it was one of the brands that was just off the charts in China we&#39;ll go into it in more detail next week but if you look at the balance sheet um number one they generated let&#39;s get this here okay wanted let&#39;s look at the long-term debt it&#39;s gone from in the last three quarters it&#39;s gone from 5.7 billion to 4.7 billion to 3.9 billion now they got the 1.5 billion coming in from the sale of supreme which are going to take this down again so now their balance Sheet&#39;s going to be in good shape which all you need is free cash flow and a

in his own right particularly with uh China e s he actually reposted an excerpt from a podcast I did in March that was eerily um predictive let&#39;s just put it that way it was it was really crazy to hear it uh I did on this exact subject about the carry trade in March that predicted the events that we&#39;ve now seen in the past week why I&#39;m going to replay this right now is because it also talks about what we were waiting for with the Yen and with the Chinese Yuan as an indicator for what would happen with Chinese equities in other words all the pieces are coming into the puzzle that should make Baba hum where we got earnings coming in we got the new buyers coming in but now the global macro things are actually benefiting to uh also offer support more important than the fed this

that time the pandemic was a lengthly exception this is the general idea borrow money at 0% interest carry it abroad to invest at 2% the difference is your profit it&#39;s a sure winner lending to governments is considered risk-free because there&#39;s virtually no chance they won&#39;t repay their debts they can always print more money take your cash to other places than the US and your profits could be even bigger for example Mexico&#39;s 10-year Government Bond is currently just shy of 10% who does it institutions what could go wrong uh while it seems like a sure thing and mostly has been there are still risk changes in interest rates and exchange rates can either reinforce or derail the strategy for example the boj&#39;s ultral loose policy has driven the yend to 30-year lows against the dollar which makes the carry trade even more profitable because you&#39;re borrowing in Yen at zero rates reinvesting in dollars uh and making the spread and then getting an appreciation

been looking at as it related to our exposure in China expressed in a position in Alibaba and what we&#39;ve been talking about is as the fed eases and the dollar weakend Emerging Markets will get bid and China will be a benefici that is true but what I laid out here which is even more important is the yuan&#39;s relationship to the US dollar and as we can see almost perfectly as the Yuan rallied from 2000 relative to the US dollar the Yuan strengthened uh from 2016 to 2018 Alibaba had a parabolic move the Yuan strength is in Black the Alibaba is in red and you can see as the Yuan went up Alibaba went parabolic the Yuan rolled over Alibaba crashed down and then uh the final rally as the Yuan started to recover you had that parabolic move into 2021 with Ali Baba Yuan rolled over Alibaba and the rest of Chinese and kweb stocks crashed it&#39;s been doing this double bottom and this could have been the sea change we have all been waiting for ladies and gentlemen that we get this double bottom in like we saw in 2019 and 2020 and a parabolic move up and we get the Yuan off the mat Yuan starts to appreciate because the boj&#39;s new policy stance and the fed&#39;s new policy stance uh Yuan being appreciative stance of tightening rates fed being depreciative stance of loosening rates strengthening the Yuan which will cause the flows into China into Chinese equities to explode yet again no one can see that right now until it happens and then this will be the most hated rally all the way up of all time no one will believe it until it hits 200 then they will hate it and then they will join it and that&#39;s what will happen and today was the warning shot fired all around the world following the meeting when the FED confirmed they were going to be doish and they have no choice Bank of Japan has been the liquidity back stop for Global central banks while they got inflation under control for the last two years and now Japan is saying we&#39;ve got inflation coming we want to normalize our policy it&#39;s time for you to back stop us we are going to normalize policy and that is the global coordinated Central Bank policy that has worked so well so now it&#39;s flip-flopping from strong dollar weak Yen uh and weak foreign currencies to now weaker dollar weaker Euro stronger Yen uh Stronger Yen stronger Yuan and that will be great for Chinese equities and I think the misnomer here for everyone chasing Japanese equities is the stronger Japanese Yen despite all the constructive developments as it relates to corporate governance and uh spins and shareholder friendly policies moving in the right direction I do think the stronger Yen will be a headwind the weekend has been H Tailwind for the recent rally in Japanese stocks it will now become a headwind and all the Chinese flows that have come out of China and into Japan are now going to go back home as price starts to change opinion opinion follows Trend and this move here today albeit it doesn&#39;t mean that it&#39;s going to do it tomorrow but it&#39;s the beginning of this regime change that is significantly important for so many of the things that we&#39;re doing and for the global change uh around the world this will also support small caps this will also support RS this will also support dividend payers code value stocks like Stanley Black and&amp; Decker genac 3M all these Industrials that have been waiting to take off natural gas companies like Comstock resources etc etc etc so very excited here the 10year did not know what to do today um it started by collapsing and then it started to get bit up I think what you&#39;re going to see over the next few weeks is while the dollar starts to re weaken the Yen starts to get bid the Yuan starts to strengthen the 10-year bonds are going to slowly climb and yields are going to slowly compress now just as I always said with the FED because most of the time the the move is bad after Powell speaks and I always say don&#39;t get faked out the first move is often the wrong move it may in fact be the case that that could be true this time as well could we be Off to the Races for 19 out of 21 weeks up in US equities it could be that would be great I mean it was very interesting today today I think overall the portfolio is up 2.2% and the general indices were up between 90 basis points and and a buck so you know our Hedges were moving against us but the overall portfolio was outperforming uh the deterioration of the hedges as we&#39;re going to discuss in the article of the week um and it was a great day 2.2% on any day is great um uh it was it was interesting to see and maybe we&#39;ll get even further follow through and this will continue for another four weeks who knows I would be alert uh that that&#39;s all I was going to say as a matter of fact I was going to lean into the hedges today but we already have full 2% of equity Capital that is sufficient to create an extra uh um 10% of free Capital if we&#39;re right on the four to six% pullback over the next couple of months but [Music] um uh you know I wouldn&#39;t number one I wouldn&#39;t be pessimistic because a lot of things are lining up right and we&#39;re going to go through a list of them and number two I wouldn&#39;t be chasing if I wasn&#39;t already fully invested uh either especially in the shiny objects that have already run um because well you might get a few days follow through I would just keep an open mind sometimes that first move is a fake out and let&#39;s see how how it plays out uh in the next few days I think the real underlying move should be a you know as we look out for to to 12 weeks Yen starts to strengthen bonds start to get bid dollar starts to weaken uh Emerging Markets get bid us maybe flattish to down uh could be flat sideways which we discussed you know three four weeks ago we said probably the move that screws the most people is the the indices actually just grind sideways so they take out all the put premium they take out all the call Premium um and and and I&#39;d be open-minded to that because that implies now\n\ncould we be Off to the Races for 19 out of 21 weeks up in US equities it could be

Intel had reported earnings for Q2 revenues dropped 1% year on year and the stock dropped 30% which is something to keep in mind guys to keep things in perspective revenues were down 1% year on-ear the stock dropped 30% year onye so what does Warren Buffett talk about great investment opportunities come around when excellent companies are surrounded by unusual circumstances that caused the stock to be misappreciation in 11 years since 2013 the company also announced the suspension of the dividend starting in Q4 and a layoff of more than 15% of the workforce I spoke with CEO Pat galinger his only broadcast interview right after the analyst call last night starting with the layoff you know it&#39;s hard this is the Intel family so I feel this very deeply at the same time making the steps to have an efficient Intel for the future that has both process and product leadership but also Financial sustainability in the model you know we&#39;re committed to this journey you know this is the most substantial you know uh restructuring of Intel since the I&#39;ll say the memory microprocessor transition four decades ago we have laid out on an audacious journey of rebuilding this company and we&#39;re going to get that done and today&#39;s uh announcement is accelerating the financial piece of that even as we build on the product and process capab abilities that we&#39;ve put in place I asked Ginger about the reasoning Behind These Cuts aside from the immediate need to preserve cash we&#39;re making these cuts to build a more efficient Intel and what happened at the beginning of the year was We disclosed this new financial model the new operating model of Intel a worldclass fabulous company and a world-class Foundry Company we began a clean sheet analysis of the two pieces of the business and we said what does worldclass look like for each of those uh businesses because we were operating in the old model for five decades and that clean sheet exercise led us to say these are the changes that we need to be an efficient Nimble company for the future that&#39;s what&#39;s driving the restructuring that you&#39;ve heard us announced today the financial performance accelerated that a bit but the work was already launched and underway from the start of the year and now we want to get them done quickly so that we have this new operational model in place and fully supported by a more efficient organization so we expect the majority of these will be finished uh this year so that we&#39;re able to have a more efficient effective Intel Foundry Intel products and an overall Intel delivering product and process leadership with financial performance as well I also asked G singer why an investor seeing the stock plummet today and seeing the dividend suspension would put money in now well we believe that those foundational Investments are realizing beginning now right these new products we&#39;re seeing them come to life you know for instance the aipc is a great example of that we have the leadership product today with core Ultra we&#39;re about to announce the next generation of that at the EA show uh coming up next month you know lunar Lake our second generation core Ultra you know unquestioned leadership and performance and AI capabilities dramatic improvements and power you know our next Generation server products are shipping this quarter so I&#39;ll say all of this hard work that we&#39;ve done starts to materialize now and I think we&#39;ve reset the financial expectations now and we&#39;ve taken the steps that you know the markets should look at and say wow they are really getting their house in order for a efficient Intel building on the leadership Intel work of the last three years now is the opportunity to start benefiting from those and we believe that the guidance that we&#39;ve given is now you know well placed in the market the steps were taking you know well respected and with the products and the technology we&#39;re now well positioned to begin a very solid cycle you know for the Intel of the future this has been heavy lifting and we&#39;re now confident that building on that we can go forward effectively in the market for the future uh it was a tough quarter a few back and the Hope was that there was a trajectory after that point that would be more predictable we&#39;re here now um and it sounds like you&#39;re saying that again at what point do we know that those kinds of surprises and the needs for realignment are out of the way or is this just such a a rocky period uh for Intel and the the changes that are needed in the industry that you can&#39;t say clearly you know this has been a challenging rebuild this has been an audacious rebuilding of Intel one that I&#39;m proud of the work that we&#39;ve done you know rebuilding a company like this is heavy work we always said it was going to be a five plus year Journey here we are three years in we&#39;ve accomplished the most significant process technology you know cycle people didn&#39;t think it was possible now the end is clearly in sight as we&#39;ve released the pdk the products have come to life These are significant Milestones ones that people thought were impossible three years ago they&#39;re now done John you know and building on that these new products that we&#39;re bringing these are competitive products you know we&#39;re no longer in a position that we&#39;re losing market share because we have inadequate products and our AI products aipc our gouty 3 that we&#39;re beginning to ship this quarter you know all of these things are now coming together so yes I understand some of those concerns but I&#39;d also say look at what we&#39;ve gotten done this is incredible what we&#39;ve gotten done and we&#39;re now combining that with the steps to build a more efficient Intel this is the most significant rebuilding of Intel in four plus decades I&#39;m proud of the work we&#39;ve gotten done and we&#39;re committed to finish the job and we are well on our way to do exactly that a lot riding on gudy 3 as that launches in Rams and aipc we&#39;ll see where Intel goes from here and we&#39;re back so I put out a note after earnings which I usually don&#39;t do by the way way on Twitter X and I said I quoted him launching in Q3 you know the big thing\n\n### FEATURED_COMPANY_DEEP_DIVES\nbe more

this is incredible what we&#39;ve gotten done and we&#39;re now combining that with the steps to build a more efficient Intel this is the most significant rebuilding of Intel in four plus decades I&#39;m proud of the work we&#39;ve gotten done and we&#39;re committed to finish the job and we are well on our way to do exactly that a lot riding on gudy 3 as that launches in Rams and aipc we&#39;ll see where Intel goes from here and we&#39;re back so I put out a note after earnings which I usually don&#39;t do by the way way on Twitter X and I said I quoted him launching in Q3 you know the big thing here is\n\nbut the products that are going to really move the needle for are going to be the gpus which are actually just launching this quarter which is which so the game hasn&#39;t even started they&#39;re holding their own they&#39;re able to maintain their revenues basically flat year on-ear but they don&#39;t even have the products in the market wants right now which you could say well why don&#39;t they because of all the bad decisions that were made that Ginger is writing with the four nodes in 5 years which is now basically complete but the market is too impatient which creates the Mis appraisal uh that creates the opportunity for people like us so launching in Q3 Intel&#39;s gouty 3 will take accelerated performance to the next level at just 2third the cost of competitive offerings to put it in perspective we expect Intel gouty 3 to deliver roughly two times the performance per dollar so on both inference and training versus is nvidia&#39;s h100 Chip so half the cost twice the performance 40% more energy efficient that&#39;s going to be competitive partner product especially because what did that Nvidia people used to say well it doesn&#39;t matter by the time you have your gouty 3 we&#39;re going to have Blackwell well Blackwell got delayed due to engineering Pro problems so it&#39;s going to give Intel a 3-month window to get this chip out there where everyone&#39;s going to start to say wait a second half the cost twice twice as efficient more energy efficient which cuts my overhead and Intel is going to gain some share here um so like like I said very hard to compete when the desired product is still baking in the oven that changes in Q3 for Intel which is now second quarter Revenue down 1% uh stock drop 30% Q3 is expected to be down 8% also weaker for the industry then Q4 Intel guides back to the Topp of range plus 5% Revenue growth year on-ear um as much as Intel disappointed from what they are communicating it looks like a temporary impairment versus a p permanent impairment it will take longer but time will tell price is what you pay value is what you get no one knows if price will go lower or higher in the short term but I&#39;ll take my chances on a firm that is set with government backing and support to become the leading AI systems Foundry and the second largest Foundry in the world by 2030 leading AI systems Foundry and second largest Foundry in the world by 2030 that&#39;s Ginger uh from q1 of of 2024 and you can see their products we&#39;re not going to go into that right now ### HEADLINES_AND_NEWS\nokay so this is from market watch it says Intel&#39;s worst drop in decades may have been steeper if not for this Factor the US government cannot afford to let Intel struggle over the longterm one analyst says uh well maybe two analyst because I&#39;ve been saying that for the last few weeks investors may have a sense that the company will be safe in the end despite its challenges thanks to Intel standing as a domestic chip manufacturer at a time when governments are interested in propping up local players in the chip Market in other circumstances we believe we would now be having going concern conversations with clients Bernstein Stacy ragon wrote a note to his clients by the way that&#39;s what the stock is trading like now and that is not on the table quote to just like Cooper standard when it was trading at $5 and $4 and $3 when we were pounding the table to that end and perhaps the one positive subsidies and partner contributions when combined with spending cuts and dividend suspension looks set to add $40 billion of incremental cash to the company&#39;s balance sheet through the end of 2025 suggesting Intel will survive in some form to continue the fight and that&#39;s the whole key with turnarounds is Runway right the subsidy point is intriguing intriguing Intel stuck a struck a deal with the US government earlier this year that awarded the company 8.5 billion in direct funding as well as 11 billion in loans through the chips act that&#39;s government program that&#39;s meant to bolster the US position in chip manufacturing and one that shows officials are thinking more seriously about help how to help players compete in this vital industry moving on uh given the increas inre inly critical role that semiconductors play and the precariousness of geopolitics governments including the US are making domestic chip capabilities more of a priority Intel sits in an especially important spot for the us because the company manufactures the chips itself that&#39;s the thing Nvidia and and all these other companies that don&#39;t manufacture own chips they are going to be at the mercy of Intel and Taiwan semiconductor which are going to have a duopoly our country and government cannot afford to let Intel founder and really struggle long term ASO desk based Jordan Klein said in a note to clients but Intel stands out the US government has a vested interest in Intel being a real player in Foundry and winning at the Leading Edge Klein wrote Intel is too important of a long-term strategic asset this reminds you of what of Boeing okay that&#39;s why Boeing hasn&#39;t been taken out to the Woodshed because it&#39;s a duopoly that&#39;s what Intel is going to be with Taiwan semiconductor Taiwan has taking us chip business one factor that led to a sharp subsequent decline in chip stocks though Intel stocks escaped that session unscathed demonstrating how investors view the company as the one that could benefit if nationalism comes to play more of a role in the industry Intel&#39;s conundrum parallels to that of Boeing another domestic Titan besieged BY execution issues that have P that have pressured financials but while Boeing isn&#39;t a major financial institution like a too big to fail Banks the company operates as the domestic half of a du ol with Airbus and it occupies a key position in the defense and Aerospace markets Boeing is an iconic business and major employer and the US government likely has a vested interest in its success as well as Intel&#39;s Intel&#39;s plan is to grow first and to shrink Intel&#39;s plan to grow first to shrink with layoffs reorganization and suspension of its shareholder dividend yet the news from Intel&#39;s second quarter earnings report on Thursday wasn&#39;t all bad Pat gelsinger continued to reiterate the company&#39;s ambitious plans for five nodes in four years to enables its Foundry business for both internal and external customers to catch up to Taiwan semiconduction manufacturing is still on track and executing as planned that means the critical 18a process node will indeed power some of Intel&#39;s most important products over the next two years the ability for Intel to be a key competitor in The Foundry space Remains the primary focus of the company&#39;s leadership Intel has shipped more has shipped more more than 15 million of its first AIP PC chips codenamed meteor Lake and is confident will have 40 million unit Ship by the end of 2024 that&#39;s a huge milestone and dwarfs dwarfs what AMD or Qualcomm could hope to do in the same time frame so that&#39;s that let&#39;s cover here there&#39;s so much to cover you really if you are thinking about owning it or already own it you really need to read through these parts that I highlighted we&#39;ll be here for 5 hours cuz it took me 5 hours to do ### MISCELLANEOUS\nokay as it relates to fourth quarter with an expectation of healthier inventory positions exiting the quarter and continuation of Enterprise refresh cycle we should see Revenue growth at the high end of seasonal in the fourth quarter so this is a short-term blip until they get the new products uh and and uh a seasonal blip as it relates to the next quarter uh that you just have to kind of see through in the short term uh mobile ey Revenue so some of their non-controlling businesses weren&#39;t doing well mobile ey uh although they&#39;re it improved and they expected to get better they Altera was a train wreck that hurt them a little bit but on balance let just get to some of these start operating cash flow was 2.3 billion up approximately 3.5 billion sequentially on better working capital um gross capx of 5.7 billion was more than offset by 11.5 billion in Grants and partner contributions highlighted by Apollo&#39;s scip investment in our Ireland Factory operations resulting in adjusted free cash flow of $8.2 billion the key is Runway here uh revenues were down 1% sequentially oh we&#39;re down 1 point year-over-year but their revenues were actually up 1% sequentially Revenue was in line with the range we provided in May after receiving notice of an export license restriction which negatively impacted our business in China Intel products and Intel Foundry both delivered 4% year-over-year growth offset by headwinds in our more cyclical businesses so there&#39;s a lot of good stuff under the surface it&#39;s just most people shoot first ask\n\nand is confident will have 40 million unit Ship by the end of 2024 that&#39;s a huge milestone and dwarfs dwarfs what AMD or Qualcomm could hope to do in the same time frame so that&#39;s that let&#39;s cover here there&#39;s so much to cover you really if you are thinking about owning it or already own

road at 80 or 100 bucks we&#39;ll be happy to help them out when they get excited and they actually start to read stuff launching Q3 launching in Q3 Intel gouty 3 will take our accelerator performance to the next level at just 2/3 of the cost of competitive offerings to put it in perspective we expect gy 3 to deliver roughly two times performance per dollar on both inference and hand and training versus h100 nvidia&#39;s h100 gy 3 has a strong ecosystem supporting Dell Technologies huet Packard Enterprise Lenovo super micro foxcon gigabyte inventech Quant Cloud technology and wion then they talk about their Intel Zeon 6 code named Sierra Forest 25% better performance versus competitors Granite rapid Rapids we&#39;ll be shipping later this quarter that&#39;s also off the 18a server product everything is falling in place 130 million xeons powering data centers around the world today greater delivery performance efficiency so people forget this is a business that&#39;s still doing $50 billion a year yes margin have contracted yes they didn&#39;t get their the new products out quickly enough but they still have unbelievable franchise no one can compete with them on the aipc refresh they&#39;re going to do 40 million uh they&#39;ve already done 15 million they&#39;re going to get the GPU chips out cheaper faster better um Revenue will bounce back by Q4 and the five nodes in four years are done and then the other thing you look at adjusted free cash flow you look at some of the things that are up certainly Data Center and AI was down not good total Intel products operating income was up operating segment Revenue was up so the key things that matter desktop notebook everything was up materially it was some of these other non-core Altera the bed okay and it was down from 848 million to 361 it&#39;s in their all other category this is their stuff that they don&#39;t care about anymore like mobile ey uh and eventually they will completely divest of so if you put it in perspective uh lunar Lake our next Generation aipc which achieved production release ahead of schedule in July will be the next industrywide Catalyst for the device refresh lunar Lake delivers Superior performance at half the power with 50% better graphics performance and 40% more power efficiency versus the prior generation three time more tops gen on gen so each thing is getting better and better for lower and lower costs which will create competition in the marketplace ### FEATURED_COMPANY_DEEP_DIVES\nCooper standard so I read this Moody upgrading by the way see our historic thesis and updates for Cooper standard since May of 2022 when we entered the position at a basis in the low fives    okay so just today Cooper standard debt got upgraded okay and what they say is okay the upgrades reflect a strong Rebound in earning since 2022 that has led to significantly lower leverage improved liquidity and reduced risk of further debt restructuring under the still burdensome capital structure debt capital structure sustainable price adjustments and cost recoveries from customers a transition to a more index-based commodity input cost contracts and rigorous focus on continuous Improvement Have Been instrumental in generating improved operating results in addition headcount reductions announced in mid 2022 are expected to generate 20 to 25 million in Savings in the second half of 2024 and generate annualized Savings of at least 40 million beginning in 2 modest returns and our expectation for negative free cash flow through 2024 since 2023 the company has stemmed the margin erosion it had experienced prior from operating inefficiencies caused by lower and uneven vehicle production volumes as well as challenging cost input environment Cooper standard maintains solid Market positions in ceiling systems and Fuel and Brake Delivery Systems and fluid transfer systems where demand fundamentals are largely drivetrain agnostic a product M mix skewed towards SUVs cuvs and light trucks including content on top selling vehicle platforms help mitigate the competitive highly fragmented nature in core and end markets the stable Outlook reflects our expectation that supply chain cost reductions from lean initiatives and heightened focus on continuous Improvement will help sustain current returns ongoing rationalization of cost structure combined with higher margin new platform launches replace ing lower performing programs should help offset the impact of softening Global light vehicle production volumes and enable margin expansion through 2025    reflects our expectation that the company will maintain adequate liquidity cash balance of about 100 million even with the negative free cash flow why do they have negative free cash flow because they&#39;re now   they elected not to do the pick they&#39;re doing cash pay on the debt contributing to cash shortfall is the expiration of the pick options on the security notes in 2025 we do anticipate the company to make progress toward generating positive and sustainable free cash flow in 2025 the undrawn 180 million asset back lending facility had availability of 173 million at June 30th 2024 the abbl was amended in 2024 extending the expiration date to 2029 and reducing the facility to 150 million from 180 million beginning March of 2025 okay so that&#39;s not me and that&#39;s not Cooper standard writing all of those good words about Cooper standard that is Moody&#39;s a debt rating agency writing that about Cooper standard so what did they do they dram even though car volumes have not come up and they&#39;ve actually come down   they were expected to be 16.1 million they&#39;re only 15.8 million expected they were able to grow their margin profile so their gross profit   was 82 million an increase of 6.7 versus the same quarter last year new business award 60.6 million but the key is we&#39;re going to get into some of these key things here as we get into the earnings called transcript   you see the fluid Handling Systems grew by about 5 million the decline in Revenue was just due to the business that they sold that was no longer included so if you add back the business that was in from the quarter that they&#39;re comparing to their revenues were up modestly even though volumes were down because of the efficiencies   and because of their improved products and improved pricing the overall guidance   stayed basically the same adjusted eida 180 to0 million versus 180 to 210 and that includes the cash pay they were deciding whether they were going to cash pay they decided to cash pay which shows they have confidence of the back half of the Year business and they&#39;ve got still got 266 million doll of liquidity you can see where they gained in adjusted eBid year on-year was their manufacturing and purchasing efficiencies volume and mix and their savings from restructuring which is going to come up even more this year and then year-to date same three areas   improved and you can see why the sales were just a hair less 27 million of the revenues 1.4 billion to 1.38 billion you lost 27 million from the tire European entire business that they sold which was non-profitable   otherwise their net sales were actually up year on-ear   so they&#39;ve got more cost savings coming you can see the 80% more parts for hybrids than IC and there are some key points here look at the debt maturities   nothing until 2026 they&#39;ve got 43 million and then 2027 so they&#39;re going to refinance between now and 2027 3 years from now   they get a couple quarters of positive free cash flow rates come down if they do 250 basis point cuts and refinance the whole thing take their debt thing down and push it out to 2030 which is all the runway they need for volumes to come back in the meantime they are operating like Simone bils on a   on a on a walking plank   getting gold medals because their margins continue to go up they&#39;re extracting more and more profits out of less and less volume that volume will come back   and they cut out another 16 millions of savings through Leen it initiatives and other cost programs they improved their gross margin by 100 basis points compared to the second quarter of last year and 61 million of net new business Awards they outpaced   Global Automotive production which declined by 0.5%   their revenues were actually up 1% when you back out the divesture so they outper formed by 150 basis points in terms of Topline gross profit for the second quarter was 11% 11.7% of sales this compares to 10.7% of sales in the second quarter of 2023 adjusted eida was 50.9 Million compared to 47.9 million   so that&#39;s positive they&#39;re getting more with less and wait till they have more with more is going to be a big deal   despite lower sales despite lower sales our business was actually more efficient as grow gross profit increased to 144.5 million for the first half of the year and gross profit margin improved by 90 basis points versus the first half of 2023 adjusted evit for the half was 80.3 Million up 33% versus the prior year 6 months and the technical rubber fature was 15 million $9 million of improvement for the quarter manufacturing liquidity 267 million okay this is very important   and I&#39;ll probably see them at JP Morgan on Thursday if I can get to a flight afterwards it we got to move some things around we&#39;ll see   let me assure you that we&#39;re 100% focused on this task they&#39;re talking about deleveraging and refinancing given our leadership frameless

ASK_ME_ANYTHING_QA\nask me anything  question let&#39;s get right down to it we don&#39;t have too many this week cu the call is so early um but we&#39;re going to cover the ones we have we do have like 10 ultas at 12 times earnings this is from John five very cheap and buying back shares looking to expand International any thoughts on looking into this business yeah I I&#39;ve looked at it and looked at it and looked at it and I think this is going to be an error of omission where I just don&#39;t get involved because when all is said and done it&#39;s still a bricks and mortar retailer um but yeah I mean it&#39;s getting to that point where it&#39;s attractive you look at the free cash flow is kind of holding in there revenues are going up return on capital is strong margins are holding in so would I take a punt on it I think you&#39;re probably okay but you know at the most you know over the next three or four years you&#39;re probably barely looking at a double so when something&#39;s not like super easy and straightforward to me and they return over 3 four years is less than a double I just immediately take a pass but I&#39;ll take a look at a couple of these things let&#39;s take a look at cash flow so it&#39;s fine they&#39;re doing a billion dollars of cash flow let&#39;s take a look at their income statement revenues have been flattish but they&#39;re going up in the right direction balance sheets probably fine 520 million of cash is this possible they have no long-term debt with uh retail stores wow that&#39;s pretty amazing um turn on Capital I don&#39;t know you know this has been on the watch list for a while I think you just have to understand what&#39;s the growth profile moving forward John cuz there&#39;s others like Sally Beauty that are really in trouble um that haven&#39;t been doing well well so if you can understand its competitive Advantage the and how they&#39;re going to sustain that I think you might have something here and it might be worth an investment um but you know just looking at the numbers take a look at the margins margins are holding in they&#39;re down a little bit but if you can get comfort with their competitive advantage and understand why are they actually down almost 50% in the last 6 months uh and feel good about that also check comparable store sales versus uh overall sales that that that could probably be a tell as well you know Five Below expanded a lot of stores uh to grow sales but their comp store sales were down and that might be the problem with Ulta also people are worried a little bit about the consumer so if you can get comfort about all those things you might have enough margin of safety to make an investment here uh and uh I think you did pretty good work on that one

it's a garbage business and I don't I really don't want to do it at any price so I'm going to pass on that but I think you might you know I think we've covered that one a couple times um and I think it will probably work but you know this stuff with it's revenue's going up cash flows negative margins negative I mean this is one of those that are better for a trade than for owning like right Right Aid is bankrupt I think this might be the last man standing I just don't want to be in the space there's too many counter wins with the pharmacy benefit managers with Amazon with direct to Consumer I I just don't want to play there they used to make all their money selling cigarettes now now that's gone Christian Dy SIU air they're doop and LCC Air Asia groups s suck at hammered uh only company did not need to restructure The Debs last thing I want to buy is an airliner in Asia but let let me take a look um SIU if I want to buy a garbage Airline I'll buy one in America let's say SIU air I don't know can I get the regular ticker here C Ebu yeah massive negative free cash flow I I don't want to mess with this let me see about the debt okay 250 million of cash billion dollars of debt negative half a billion of free cash flow no this is a train wreck I I'd pass Christian at any price Jacob what do you think about Intel after the latest quarterly results I didn't realized they reported um let me look into that kidding actually we just covered it thank you for the great question um all right David Martin found you on Tik toks a few months back and have become an avid listener podcast thanks for helping us out us very sub one million accounts curious to hear your thoughts about adding to my positions I totally understand dollar cost averaging at lower prices but when how or and or would you add to a position once it starts to move up um never that's me I buy down not up I buy red days not green days uh if you need an actual stock we can use CPS as an example no I just buy CP PS when it's red and I have cash period that's very simple uh I never buy it when it's going up or or green uh and we got plenty so we're happy with our positioning we're happy with our basis and now we're just going to let John Edwards and team Jeff Edwards and John vanis uh work their magic continue to execute until the volume I mean they've basically got this thing running like such a well-oiled machine at such low volumes that they could be cash flow positive next year assuming no growth in volumes when volumes are going to grow when the average car on the road is 13.5 years and the average Millennial is 33 years old that's when they buy they buy the most cars and dishwashers with for those of you who have asked me about whirlpool and homes and baby stuff between 33 and 40 and this time will be no different and they're going to be the beneficiary so fact they can go cash flow positive in the next year assuming no volume growth when volume growth is going to come back uh rates are going to come lower inventories are going to go up uh oems are going to start to give incentives volumes are going to start to go through the roof margins for oems will go down but um that all we care about is volumes and they will be a key beneficiary so uh hope that answers your question we'll be back next week same time same place in the mean uh no actually we'll be back at our normal time normal place in the meantime make it a great one thanks for tuning in have a great week a [Music] a [Music] [Music]\n\nbut when how or and or would you add to a position once it starts to move up um never that&#39;s me I buy down not up I buy red days not green days uh if you need an actual stock we can use CPS as an example no I just buy CP PS when it&#39;s red and I have cash period that&#39;s very simple uh I never buy it when it&#39;s going up or or green ### FEATURED_COMPANY_DEEP_DIVES\nuh and we got plenty so we&#39;re happy with our positioning we&#39;re happy with

    "HEADLINES_AND_NEWS": "\n\n### HEADLINES_AND_NEWS\nlot of great stuff to cover this week and doing it a bit early because I&#39;ve got to travel down to Virginia for the girls zones championship and got pushed back a day but we&#39;ll get there first and foremost want to congratulate Mimi uh we do family first then we get\n\n### HEADLINES_AND_NEWS\nyear which we got more than that in the NASDAQ I think we came close Peak to trough in the SNP and um and the 5% pullbacks that those are going to come three times a year no matter what you do I think we've had two already we'll probably get the third one in September October this was an excerpt from an article in bar uh Bloomberg China becoming appealing the violent reaction increases the probability of rotation to Chinese equities from Japan says Frank Ben benra strategist at sgen Chinese equities have low valuations and tend to be relatively more insulated during Global stress the quote irrational selloff in Asia has made under own China an opportunity said William y director at Invesco Hong Kong over the last 2 to 3 years China's positioning for fund managers has probably been one of the lowest in history we covered that with Charles in the context of multiple Global macro risk emerging recently we see mainland China as a relative defensive especially since many of the country specific risks appear to be already priced in you think um Chinese stocks outperformed Global during the global market route while everything else was up Mainland what China while everything else was getting shellacked the topics Etc\n\n### MACRO_DATA_SLIDES\ndown 25% Chinese stocks were out performing which is amazing haven't had it's it's exciting to see let's just put it that way ISM services are going up new ERS up mortgage rates are going down that's a positive thing that's also going to help refinancing uh commercial properties that's going to help refinancing multif family where there's pockets of distress that's going to help refinancing small cap companies all positive things uh number of Britain's expecting the economy to get better over the next year reaches 2-year High we've been talking about the UK recovery gxo Etc magnificent 7 Drew Down uh looks like 18% uh so far and uh that was another thing we were calling for for a few months and then it\n\n### FEATURED_COMPANY_DEEP_DIVES\nfinally  came uh we climaxed in uh June 20th when we put out the article about Nvidia the new pain trade that day it uh opened at 136 went up to 139 after we said it was the new pain trade of course it always goes against us before it goes for us uh and then it just collapsed down I think it got into the 90s yesterday 40% draw down uh Vic straight up to 65 let's pull up some of these\n\n### TECHNICAL_CHARTS\ncharts for my friend over there this is from slomer this came out today so you can see in the scheme of things this is not a very big correction so does it pull back all the way down to 4500 that&#39;s what his chart would imply I&#39;m not of that camp I think that this is going to be uh more subdued in nature quick acute deleveraging among leverag funds and um you know maybe that that becomes in play in September October but I don&#39;t think it&#39;s going to come in now this is the monthly seasonality since 1928 that we were referencing you can see here September is the month that we should start to be more concerned election year versus non-election year uh you can see the correction here he&#39;s pointing to 4950 maybe maybe that that&#39;ll be the aftershocks I&#39;m not really in that camp yet I think earnings have been too strong but let&#39;s let&#39;s see what happens sometimes it has nothing to do with earnings it&#39;s just uh margin calls that throw people off this other chart he has takes it down to 5071 NASDAQ already came down to 50 50% retrace trement and um 20,000 to 177,000 so yeah we covered that 18% on the mag 7 40% on Nvidia and let&#39;s see if there&#39;s anything else so small caps this you know it look felt like a lot it&#39;s not really a lot it&#39;s bouncing off this 50-day moving average I think it&#39;s already made its move and this can start to work higher cup and handle back up to new highs uh we like that story supported by earnings not by hope or by chart patterns uh the topics that&#39;s down more than this that&#39;s 81 why does you have an 81 chart on an 86 book that makes that&#39;s lazy uh this probably got all the way down to here let me just see here t o p iix oh n okay n so yeah it got down to 42,000 to 30 31,000 that&#39;s a big drop and now it bounced uh topics weekly that was as of yeah this is a better view I think he just forgot to update that chart this here shows that all the year&#39;s gains have been erased in Tokyo the Hang sang broke out of this downward Trend spiked higher earlier in the year checked back now it&#39;s starting to go back up that&#39;s actually a very nice retracement let&#39;s see how that plays out with earnings uh 10-year yield collapsed down to 370 and change remember we said 375 as a matter of fact we did take off a lot of our TLT on Friday and Monday when it just puked out we had huge profits on some of those uh call spreads and uh made many multiples on those and um I think this will Trend lower but it&#39;s due for a bounce here so we may just put that back on sometime in September and make uh take get two bites at that Apple uh this fell off his chart which is pretty wild this is what we&#39;d expecting looking at the dollar all these things why we continue to emphasize it because they&#39;re key for the China trade uh all falling into place the dollar is weakening collapsed here the Yen all the hot money coming out of Japan Canadian dollar don&#39;t worry you Looney you lunatics Looney loonatics uh Canadian Looney the can Canadian dollar will appreciate against the US dollar coming to a theater near you that&#39;s going to be a great trade uh same thing probably with the Australian dollar as China picks back up probably same with copper\n### MISCELLANEOUS\nuh let&#39;s see if there other any other key charts we want to cover here with him semiconductor equipment huge drop Vago Scott&#39;s Miracle Grow we&#39;ve covered that a few times we do like that stock um all the utilities have absolutely rallied we&#39;ve been talking utilities forever now the hedge funds are getting into them they&#39;re due for a pullback you watch what happens with those uh so if you&#39;ve run with the utilities that we&#39;ve been talking about take some profits now uh and you can probably read those in September and that&#39;s that on that front let&#39;s finish up these other charts spreads blew out a little bit yesterday Global pmis is going up manufacturing that&#39;s good Financial stress going up from that deleveraging yesterday delinquencies going up modestly but not extreme relative to history whe except for student loans because they&#39;ve all a lot of them have been forgiven auto loans are going up uh that will also be helped by lower rates is financing autos which is a big deal earning surprise have been better than the pre-co average Q2 earnings surprise to the upside by 5.5% uh that is better better than plus 3.7% preco average earnings growth was uh 15.3% X energy and financials that&#39;s pretty big uh regular earnings growth was 11.5% all in we&#39;re going to talk about that at the end uh Monday&#39;s vix closing level ranks in the 96 percentile since 1999 some level of capitulation and margin calling going on there which is why we don&#39;t use much leverage um and the largest calendar year Peak to trough S&amp;P draw down uh just about hit looks like it hit about 9% probably probably Futures hit 10% would be my expectation if you do from overnight charts uh you would see that it actually got to a little correction there gxo earnings second quarter Revenue increased 19% year-over-year to a record 2.8 billion with Organic Revenue growth of 2% they signed new business wins of approximately 270 million in annualized revenue and got a sales pipeline increase to the 12-month high of 2.3 billion they completed the the Winton acquisition in the UK which we had talked about uh all of this is positive they generated 115 million of cash flows from operations compared to 61 Million last year and 31 million of free cash flow compared with 3 million of free cash flow last year same quarter that&#39;s a big deal remember this is troughing it the whole world was Goods uh from 2020 to 2022 lot of pull forward then it was uh working through inventory iies from 23 and 24 and now they&#39;re back on track with a more balanced situation which is goods and services which will be positive for their growth going forward so just had to get this plugged in so we don&#39;t lose power there we go uh so we&#39;ll go into gxo the conference call Etc next week we&#39;ve got other ones that we spent more time on for this week\n### FEATURED_COMPANY_DEEP_DIVES\nVF Corp the name of the game with VF Corp is the fact that they&#39;re deleveraging their balance sheets the sales are still down they did have some big turnarounds in China was really really strong I saw as I was going through the numbers today the stock was up pretty big because after the conference call um but the key thing that was important to me okay greater China Allin but it was by brand it was one of the brands that was just off the charts in China we&#39;ll go into it in more detail next week but if you look at the balance sheet um number one they generated let&#39;s get this here okay wanted let&#39;s look at the long-term debt it&#39;s gone from in the last three quarters it&#39;s gone from 5.7 billion to 4.7 billion to 3.9 billion now they got the 1.5 billion coming in from the sale of supreme which are going to take this down again so now their balance Sheet&#39;s going to be in good shape which all you need is free cash flow and a good balance sheet and then you have the runway to turn everything around uh and you&#39;re back Off to the Races so uh let&#39;s see here balance sheet review okay free cash flow turn 31 margin moderated okay so he&#39;s still more energized than ever that&#39;s good to see we&#39;re going to go into this more the conference call was good you could tell by the way the stock acted today and the key is the balance sheet risk is now off the table which is like what we had to go through with Cooper standard and by the way Cooper standard&#39;s debt got upgraded today which is mindboggling and exciting to see uh so next week we&#39;re going to go into VF Corp in a very detailed way but for now um we&#39;re pretty pleased with our first look in their turnaround because the solvency risk which is number one is off the table they&#39;ve got free cash flow they&#39;ve got a good balance sheet now they&#39;re just starting to turn revenues region by region\n### HEADLINES_AND_NEWS\num as for Teemu teu sellers revolt against fines and withheld pay so again we&#39;ve said for months that uh pin duo duo and teu is the number are either unsustainable or unreliable I think it may prove to be a combination of both you can refer back to that article in the financial times this is an article from Barons saying that uh talking about Intel we&#39;re going to cover a lot of Intel today and you know it says from the start G singer said his goal was to achieve leadership and Chip manufacturing by 2025 sure enough Intel&#39;s new processors called Panther Lake are scheduled for release in the second half of 2025 when I asked the senior Intel executive when Intel would\n\nlet&#39;s look at the long-term debt it&#39;s gone from in the last

Intel&#39;s new processors called Panther Lake are scheduled for release in the second half of 2025 when I asked the senior Intel executive when Intel would\n### HEADLINES_AND_NEWS\nfinally  be able to make a processor that&#39;s better at performance and power efficiency versus amd&#39;s offering offerings the person pointed to the new Panther Lake chip there&#39;s a glimmer of hope for Intel on the horizon uh that said I&#39;m not suggesting it&#39;s time to buy the stock until it&#39;s had too many missteps and false starts PR need to wait but basically the case that this author is making take him is that a lot of these bad decisions were made before Ginger Ginger took the helm at 2021 many of Intel&#39;s problems stem from decisions made by his predecessor take several years to hire the right Talent then develop then design then make new Chips we&#39;re going to go through it line by line in the article of the week so just hang tight China&#39;s Yuan climbs to seven-month high on stronger Yen unwinding of global carry trade this is what we&#39;ve been waiting for ladies and gentlemen we&#39;ve done the overlays over and over again uh for months about the Yuan needing to appreciate dollar depreciate and uh Chinese yield on government debt start to go up we&#39;re going to we&#39;re going to talk about that in just a moment Global car trade y gains okay we covered that China&#39;s Services activity expands we covered that most popular trades are unraveling this I covered with Charles so what were the four most crowded trades last month and for many months before a long Magnificent Seven that&#39;s unwinding with the carry trade on wand second most crowded trade was short Yen had the biggest rally in the yen in the last two weeks that we&#39;ve ever probably seen in history three was short small caps that started to unwind last month it took a little hiccup this uh last week and a half that&#39;s going to re accelerate based on fundamentals and the fourth most crowded trade was short China equities and what did better than any other asset class in the last week China equities so uh that is what we&#39;ve been waiting for Global hedge funds actually added Chinese domestic stocks in July says Goldman Sachs this is daily saying a policy adjustment is still coming soon or rather than later even though she&#39;s not worried about anything at all she&#39;s still going to get that policy adjustment happening sooner rather than later in video which we had talked about before it crashed when everyone was clamoring all over each other to get stock after they did the split and sucked in all the new buyers uh Jensen Wong sold 323 million a stock in July before the decline he dumped it all on the retail investors heads so beware when that happens again I think people got wise to it because super micro or some one of those companies reported after the bell and they announced a split and the stock was down 9% uh afterm Market biggest margin debt on wine since 1999 spurred Taiwan Taiwan stock route that&#39;s why we don&#39;t use much leverage Chinese brokerages talk up local stocks after global meltdown Goldman says buying the S&P after 5% drop is usually profitable we showed you the data behind that Mar here&#39;s from Nick timos from yesterday Market sell-offs upends Fed rate cut calculus a further slow down in the labor market could lead to a larger Half Point rate cut next month so the FED Whisperer is starting to drop hints about 50 basis point Cuts as a trial balloon for the feds setting the stage that&#39;s pretty interesting China defensive SE sectors win favor as Asian stocks stage rebound and now onto our article of the week like a phoenix From the Ashes\n\n### HEADLINES_AND_NEWS\nmore important than the fed this week as it relates to central banks which is the Bank of Japan just handicapped a winning strategy what to know about the Yen carry trade if you&#39;re in finance you have to know about the carry trade so this is a great article from Barons that lays it out Simply uh what is it it it&#39;s very simple you borrow money in a country with very low interest rates and then invest in a country where you can get considerably higher returns Japan&#39;s Central Bank interest rate has been around zero since 2016 the US uh 10-year bond yield by contrast has been higher than at at least 2% for most of that time the pandemic was a lengthly exception this is the general idea borrow money at 0% interest carry it abroad to invest at 2% the difference is your profit it&#39;s a sure winner lending to governments is considered risk-free because there&#39;s virtually no chance they won&#39;t repay their debts they can always print more money take your cash to other places than the US and your profits could be even bigger for example Mexico&#39;s 10-year Government Bond is currently just shy of 10% who does it institutions what could go wrong uh while it seems like a sure thing and mostly has been there are still risk changes in interest rates and exchange rates can either reinforce or derail the strategy for example the boj&#39;s ultral loose policy has driven the yend to 30-year lows against the dollar which makes the carry trade even more profitable because you&#39;re borrowing in Yen at zero rates reinvesting in dollars uh and making the spread and then getting an appreciation in in the dollar relative to the Yen throughout that whole period but if the Yen starts to strengthen now it will cut into carry trades earnings Rising interest rates tend to strengthen currencies by making investments in those currencies more attractive the Yen sold off on headlines  that the boj would keep an accommodated policy for a while but recent\n\nbut the products that are going to really move the needle for are going to be the gpus which are actually just launching this quarter which is which so the game hasn&#39;t even started they&#39;re holding their own they&#39;re able to maintain their revenues basically flat year on-ear but they don&#39;t even have the products in the market wants right now which you could say well why don&#39;t they because of all the bad decisions that were made that Ginger is writing with the four nodes in 5 years which is now basically complete but the market is too impatient which creates the Mis appraisal uh that creates the opportunity for people like us so launching in Q3 Intel&#39;s gouty 3 will take accelerated performance to the next level at just 2third the cost of competitive offerings to put it in perspective we expect Intel gouty 3 to deliver roughly two times the performance per dollar so on both inference and training versus is nvidia&#39;s h100 Chip so half the cost twice the performance 40% more energy efficient that&#39;s going to be competitive partner product especially because what did that Nvidia people used to say well it doesn&#39;t matter by the time you have your gouty 3 we&#39;re going to have Blackwell well Blackwell got delayed due to engineering Pro problems so it&#39;s going to give Intel a 3-month window to get this chip out there where everyone&#39;s going to start to say wait a second half the cost twice twice as efficient more energy efficient which cuts my overhead and Intel is going to gain some share here um so like like I said very hard to compete when the desired product is still baking in the oven that changes in Q3 for Intel which is now second quarter Revenue down 1% uh stock drop 30% Q3 is expected to be down 8% also weaker for the industry then Q4 Intel guides back to the Topp of range plus 5% Revenue growth year on-ear um as much as Intel disappointed from what they are communicating it looks like a temporary impairment versus a p permanent impairment it will take longer but time will tell price is what you pay value is what you get no one knows if price will go lower or higher in the short term but I&#39;ll take my chances on a firm that is set with government backing and support to become the leading AI systems Foundry and the second largest Foundry in the world by 2030 leading AI systems Foundry and second largest Foundry in the world by 2030 that&#39;s Ginger uh from q1 of of 2024 and you can see their products we&#39;re not going to go into that right now ### HEADLINES_AND_NEWS\nokay so this is from market watch it says Intel&#39;s worst drop in decades may have been steeper if not for this Factor the US government cannot afford to let Intel struggle over the longterm one analyst says uh well maybe two analyst because I&#39;ve been saying that for the last few weeks investors may have a sense that the company will be safe in the end despite its challenges thanks to Intel standing as a domestic chip manufacturer at a time when governments are interested in propping up local players in the chip Market in other circumstances we believe we would now be having going concern conversations with clients Bernstein Stacy ragon wrote a note to his clients by the way that&#39;s what the stock is trading like now and that is not on the table quote to just like Cooper standard when it was trading at $5 and $4 and $3 when we were pounding the table to that end and perhaps the one positive subsidies and partner contributions when combined with spending cuts and dividend suspension looks set to add $40 billion of incremental cash to the company&#39;s balance sheet through the end of 2025 suggesting Intel will survive in some form to continue the fight and that&#39;s the whole key with turnarounds is Runway right the subsidy point is intriguing intriguing Intel stuck a struck a deal with the US government earlier this year that awarded the company 8.5 billion in direct funding as well as 11 billion in loans through the chips act that&#39;s government program that&#39;s meant to bolster the US position in chip manufacturing and one that shows officials are thinking more seriously about help how to help players compete in this vital industry moving on uh given the increas inre inly critical role that semiconductors play and the precariousness of geopolitics governments including the US are making domestic chip capabilities more of a priority Intel sits in an especially important spot for the us because the company manufactures the chips itself that&#39;s the thing Nvidia and and all these other companies that don&#39;t manufacture own chips they are going to be at the mercy of Intel and Taiwan semiconductor which are going to have a duopoly our country and government cannot afford to let Intel founder and really struggle long term ASO desk based Jordan Klein said in a note to clients but Intel stands out the US government has a vested interest in Intel being a real player in Foundry and winning at the Leading Edge Klein wrote Intel is too important of a long-term strategic asset this reminds you of what of Boeing okay that&#39;s why Boeing hasn&#39;t been taken out to the Woodshed because it&#39;s a duopoly that&#39;s what Intel is going to be with Taiwan semiconductor Taiwan has taking us chip business one factor that led to a sharp subsequent decline in chip stocks though Intel stocks escaped that session unscathed demonstrating how investors view the company as the one that could benefit if nationalism comes to play more of a role in the industry Intel&#39;s conundrum parallels to that of Boeing another domestic Titan besieged BY execution issues that have P that have pressured financials but while Boeing isn&#39;t a major financial institution like a too big to fail Banks the company operates as the domestic half of a du ol with Airbus and it occupies a key position in the defense and Aerospace markets Boeing is an iconic business and major employer and the US government likely has a vested interest in its success as well as Intel&#39;s Intel&#39;s plan is to grow first and to shrink Intel&#39;s plan to grow first to shrink with layoffs reorganization and suspension of its shareholder dividend yet the news from Intel&#39;s second quarter earnings report on Thursday wasn&#39;t all bad Pat gelsinger continued to reiterate the company&#39;s ambitious plans for five nodes in four years to enables its Foundry business for both internal and external customers to catch up to Taiwan semiconduction manufacturing is still on track and executing as planned that means the critical 18a process node will indeed power some of Intel&#39;s most important products over the next two years the ability for Intel to be a key competitor in The Foundry space Remains the primary focus of the company&#39;s leadership Intel has shipped more has shipped more more than 15 million of its first AIP PC chips codenamed meteor Lake and is confident will have 40 million unit Ship by the end of 2024 that&#39;s a huge milestone and dwarfs dwarfs what AMD or Qualcomm could hope to do in the same time frame so that&#39;s that let&#39;s cover here there&#39;s so much to cover you really if you are thinking about owning it or already own it you really need to read through these parts that I highlighted we&#39;ll be here for 5 hours cuz it took me 5 hours to do ### MISCELLANEOUS\nokay as it relates to fourth quarter with an expectation of healthier inventory positions exiting the quarter and continuation of Enterprise refresh cycle we should see Revenue growth at the high end of seasonal in the fourth quarter so this is a short-term blip until they get the new products uh and and uh a seasonal blip as it relates to the next quarter uh that you just have to kind of see through in the short term uh mobile ey Revenue so some of their non-controlling businesses weren&#39;t doing well mobile ey uh although they&#39;re it improved and they expected to get better they Altera was a train wreck that hurt them a little bit but on balance let just get to some of these start operating cash flow was 2.3 billion up approximately 3.5 billion sequentially on better working capital um gross capx of 5.7 billion was more than offset by 11.5 billion in Grants and partner contributions highlighted by Apollo&#39;s scip investment in our Ireland Factory operations resulting in adjusted free cash flow of $8.2 billion the key is Runway here uh revenues were down 1% sequentially oh we&#39;re down 1 point year-over-year but their revenues were actually up 1% sequentially Revenue was in line with the range we provided in May after receiving notice of an export license restriction which negatively impacted our business in China Intel products and Intel Foundry both delivered 4% year-over-year growth offset by headwinds in our more cyclical businesses so there&#39;s a lot of good stuff under the surface it&#39;s just most people shoot first ask",
    "MEDIA_APPEARANCE_RECAP": "\n\n### MEDIA_APPEARANCE_RECAP\nfirst I want to thank Liz Clayman and Jake Mack for having me on the Clayman countdown on Friday with Nick timos the FED Whisperer himself from the Wall Street Journal covered a lot of important stuff here including the Som rule the labor report we're going to listen in now a rate cut but a jumbo or super siiz rate cut in September Nick timos is the Wall Street journal's all things fed correspondent who understands the fed's thinking better than just about anybody and Trader Tom Hayes has been scrutinizing which stocks maybe look like a Buy in this selloff and Nick I'll start with you three days ago fed funds Futures fully expected a September rate cut of about 25 basis points right but saw only a 10% odds of a larger 50 basis point easing look at fed funds Futures right now one ugly jobs report it skyrockets to near 70% for a 50 basis point cut what do you think chair Powell is mulling right now and is the market way ahead of itself versus what the FED is thinking well Liz is the market ahead of itself I mean probably not but there's the market is sort of assuming that the current trends continue uh the FED doesn't really have to make up its mind for another six or seven weeks right they don't meet for another seven weeks so I'm sure we'll hear from fed officials uh you know a lot over those six or seven weeks but they don't really have to make up their mind now about whether the first cut uh will be 25 or 50 that's obviously where the debate is going to be what I'm hearing today from a lot of analysts is okay you can do 25 at every meeting there are three meetings left this year and that's probably locked in now as a base case for the FED there are a number of people though who have said you need interest rates to get closer to neutral sooner you need to be closer to 4% by the end of this year and so you saw JP Morgan and City Bank put out calls uh this morning for 50 basis point Cuts in September and November and another quarter point in December I don't think you're going to hear fed officials talking about that right now but the next meeting is still a ways away so you know they'll have another jobs report before that meeting they'll have we'll be able to see a lot more uh than we can today June July September November of 2022 you saw jumbo rate hikes so we know that the FED isn't afraid of making big moves of 75 basis points even but the question is now will City and JP Morgan be right they are both claiming that September and November will see um I guess a 50 basis point cut Tom uh not only is there no rotation out of Mega cap Tech and into the Russell the Russell is getting absolutely slammed biggest percentage loser here what's behind the Panic selling there and if there's any money leaving and going into somewhere where do you think it's going well the Market's afraid of two things Liz first off is is a recession because the S rule was triggered today that's when the unemployment rate 3-month moving average moves up a half a percent higher than the lowest three-month moving average 12 months before that's a mouthful but the markets are worried about a recession that's why small caps are down that's why yields are down the second thing that's happening is the unwind of the Japanese carry trade the Nik is down 20% that's a lot more than the NASDAQ and that's because the bank of Japan has been the global liquidity provider while the West Titan to fight inflation but the FED has not stepped in now that the bank of Japan is tightening so you have this liquidity dislocation pocket and guess what's happening it's a big unwinding of the most crowded trades because liquidity is drying up and the most crowded trade as you know was the Magnificent 7 and the second most crowded trade was short the Japanese Yen so with yields lower what we're looking at Liz is dividend payers that's where the opportunity is right now yeah opportunity in door Dash it's up 7% we do have a little bits of green on the screen here uh Nick before we go here as you're looking at this Market action and specifically the Panic that's in the vix I mean that that's just sort of a one-day situation but it does measure some concern about the markets do you get the sense that the FED is guided At All by these market minations and spasms one day movs Liz no but I think what what you what I'm paying attention to\n\n### MEDIA_APPEARANCE_RECAP\nwell the Market&#39;s afraid of two things Liz first off is is a recession because the S rule was triggered today that&#39;s when the unemployment rate 3-month moving average moves up a half a percent higher than the lowest three-month moving average 12 months before that&#39;s a mouthful but the markets are worried about a recession that&#39;s why small caps are down that&#39;s why yields are down the second thing that&#39;s happening is the unwind of the Japanese carry trade the Nik is down 20% that&#39;s a lot more than the NASDAQ and that&#39;s because the bank of Japan has been the global liquidity provider while the West Titan to fight inflation but the FED has not stepped in now that

specifically the Panic that&#39;s in the vix I mean that that&#39;s just sort of a one-day situation but it does measure some concern about the markets do you get the sense that the FED is guided At All by these market minations and spasms one day movs Liz no but I think what what you what I&#39;m paying attention to here is  if this is sustained does it change sentiment if you change sentiment you change business&#39;s plans to invest they slash investment budgets they decide to fire workers uh labor demand is clearly weaker than it was some months ago and so what I would worry about\n\n### MEDIA_APPEARANCE_RECAP\nfinally came uh we climaxed in uh June 20th when we put out the article about Nvidia the new pain trade that day it uh opened at 136 went up to 139 after we said it was the new pain trade of course it always goes against us before it goes for us uh and then it just collapsed down I think it got into the 90s yesterday 40% draw down uh Vic straight up to 65 let&#39;s pull up some of these RBC",
    "### MISCELLANEOUS": "\n\nthey slash investment budgets they decide to fire workers uh labor demand is clearly weaker than it was some months ago and so what I would worry about",
    "### MEDIA_APPEARANCE_RECAP": "\n\n### MEDIA_APPEARANCE_RECAP\nand then I had the pleasure to join Charles Payne on Monday to talk about the Japanese currency trade Japanese carry trade unwind some picks and a lot more thanks to Nick Palazo and Charles for having me on we&#39;re going to listen in now all right so the overarching rationale for the FED not the cut rates is that it would Panic the markets and listen I get that in most cases in life you don&#39;t want to panic but I got to tell you I have personally been in positions and play uh where those knee-jerk moves saved my life right and and also times it saved me financially from a lot of Heartache I&#39;m going to Bringing out great Hill Capital chairman uh Thomas Hayes Thomas so I know you&#39;re one of those study Edy guys check out your posture right just cool and easy like a modern day Paul Newman right but uh you know it&#39;s it&#39;s like the whole steady crowd doesn&#39;t want the FED to overreact by the same token though the markets are pushing them around right and of course you have to wonder how much things have changed since the moves from the bank of Jaan I mean the feds doesn&#39;t just have to deal within the context of us but it&#39;s also got other central banks around the world that are making aggressive moves yeah this is a big deal I think the carry trade onwi is actually pretty important you had the Nik drop 25% in a very short amount of time basically what you have is the funding currency the Japanese Yen institutions were borrowing that for free to buy the most crowded trades the Magnificent Sev so as the cost of capital went up they had to return that capital and unwind the The Magnificent Seven trades so it&#39;s like the FED as the bank of Japan hiked had the opportunity to cut to make up that that ill liquidity they didn&#39;t do that so where&#39;s the liquidity going to come from we&#39;ve had 35 Central Bank Cuts globally in the past 3 months the last time we had that many Cuts was in 2020 April 2020 we had like 95 have we ever had this sort of carry tray relationship with any I mean does do we have like that with the bank of Pakistan or something like that you know what I mean like not being I&#39;m being a little fous here but I&#39;ve never heard of this sort of relationship where like Japanese households were buying buying our tech stocks and buying our treasuries by the way and who buys that now yeah so uh this was pretty big in 2006 and 2007 when you had the lowc cost of capital with the Japanese Yen it&#39;s it&#39;s reworked itself I think now you&#39;ve probably going to find out one or two weeks from now you&#39;ve been around maybe a couple funds blew up over the weekend this felt like abnormal uh selling that we saw structural selling which creates opportunity if you have cash to deploy so let&#39;s talk about that opportunity right now you say we&#39;ve got a declining rate environment declining US dollar and there&#39;s specific areas that historically really work out that&#39;s right uh first and foremost dividend payers that&#39;s nice in a day like today you get a little bit of safety you get a little bit bit of yield while you wait but with lowering rates people want the yield and they&#39;re going to move back from money markets into dividend payers for sure cyclicals we&#39;re seeing the earnings growth of the UNM magnificent 493 accelerate while the Magnificent 7 decelerates cuz margins are compress uh compressing from the cap expend then small caps started to go and they just got whacked last week they&#39;ll be back because the earnings growth is going to go from 4% this year to 177% next year even as is a little less also after the first cut they outperform large caps by 11% in the first 12 months and then International guess which group did the best in the last 5 days China China was only down a few percent while you know the N was down 25% would you buy China specifically or would you buy like I how would you go about this look I&#39;ve been bagged in this stock for like a year and a half I own Alibaba it&#39;s a huge company a huge out the cheapest AI play in the world it&#39;s done nothing for a year and a half I think this is ready to roll they&#39;re going to report on August 15th so I like the environment with a weaker dollar with rates coming down and with the hot money coming out of Japan and back into China could be an opportunity uh we&#39;ve got a minute to go enough time to go over some of your def individual ideas that you like here CCI uh Crown crown castle was on with you uh earlier this Stock&#39;s come up a little bit but you still get a 5.5% yield uh it&#39;s got 40,000 Towers they&#39;re selling the small sale fiber business to delever the balance sheet new CEO Steve MOS I&#39;ve been waiting for this stock to go to the Moon though for like 10 years like yeah it&#39;s gone up like from 100 to 115 you collected a yield in the meantime as rates come down it&#39;ll stay up there&#39;s been doing pretty well lately yeah brought brought to you by spam right I mean they got spam they got Skippy they got Planters this is a steady grower got beat down 3 and half% % yield we like this particularly in a defensive environment right now until we figure out what&#39;s going on and then backer medical supplies medical devices 3.2% yield they&#39;re spinning off the kidney business it&#39;ll rate the multiple back from 10 to a normalized 15 multiple as that gets done toward the end of the year all right so the bottom line though these are defensive you&#39;re getting paid you&#39;re holding quality names you probably sleep better at night that&#39;s right we&#39;ll get offensive again very soon but not just yet all right let me know when thanks a lot Thomas all right folks so um\n### QUOTES_OF_THE_WEEK\nmy next guest and we&#39;re back and then want to get to the quote of the week from SE Seth claran successful investors tend to be unemotional allowing the greed and fear of others to play into their hands by the way this was a great week a great example for that by having confidence in their own analysis and judgment and like we always say know what you own uh they respond to Market forces not with blind emotion but with calculated reason successful investors for example Dem demonstrate caution in frothy markets and steadfast conviction in panicky ones indeed the very way an investor views the market and its price fluctuations is a key factor in his or her ultimate investment success or failure so those of you who have been with us for a while know that we live by this philosophy and many of you have been picking it up for yourselves and benefiting accordingly and then final quote of the week is from Warren Buffett great investment opportunities come around when excellent companies are surrounded by unusual circumstances that cause the stock to be misappreciation first name wrong uh was on Charles Payne saying This Time It&#39;s Different because immigration and covid hiring skew the numbers we will see if that&#39;s the case or not we tend to be in that camp that there same thing with the inverted yield curve two years ago people were saying the curve is inverted we&#39;re going to get a recession I said hey we already had the recession q1 and Q2 of 2022 was a technical recession uh and I think this will prove to be the case as well provided the FED steps in quickly enough and gets that done because these jobless claims numbers and unemployment numbers are moving up the other thing that happened on the jobs report was that more people entered the workforce which is also a positive thing which is why wages are coming down uh and unemployment is going up because there&#39;s a new supply of labor which we&#39;ve been waiting for for uh the excess savings to run out so people had to go to work by the way this is my beautiful hedge fund tips mug from my friends in Dallas and as always opinions not advice go to hedge fund tips.com and click on terms we deal exclusively with accredited investors and qualified institutions uh check with your financial advisor before you do anything at all labor productivity is going up unit labor costs are going down you can see here Wards Automotive Sales going up that&#39;s a positive thing we&#39;re going to talk about Cooper standard today pretty exciting actually after going through every single word of the transcript and the release uh a lot of good things happening in the way they&#39;re operating and how they&#39;ll benefit\n### HEADLINES_AND_NEWS\nBank of England cutting foreign investors dumped most Japan stocks since September of 2022 this number was as of August 2nd I&#39;m sure this was probably the most Japan stocks ever we&#39;ve been saying forever don&#39;t get sucked into Japan it&#39;s now down 25 fell 25% in 3 days or four days the uh topics did and the Nik similar amounts um economic surprise index uh UK is going up we like that recovery story we&#39;ll talk a little bit about gxo not we&#39;ll maybe go into more detail with gxo next week and what did private clients buy last week before uh Japan collapsed is they bought Japanese equities at the top and got their faces ripped off August does well in election years we&#39;re still of that camp which we covered last week we think we&#39;re going to see strength into the first cut which is late September and then we&#39;re going to see uh sell the news into the election and a year-end rally is our base case this is the chart that I referenced with Charles on making money with Charles pain on Fox Business we there&#39;s a uh back lag of global liquidity coming to Bear the most Global Central Bank Cuts since May of 2020 did you want to be a buyer or a seller of equities in May 2020 you wanted to be a massive buyer so we&#39;ve had 35 Cuts in the last 3 months uh in May of 2022 we had 92 Cuts globally and in April 2009 we had 76 Cuts so I would imagine in the next month two months three months we&#39;re going to see this up to 60 Cuts around the globe which is the perfect environment to be a buyer not a seller of equities uh that was the NASDAQ I think corrected 15% Peak to trough we were fortunate as you guys can go back to the tapes uh of taking a bunch of the uh alphabet and Amazon reluctantly by the way saying we hate taking this but we&#39;re going to have a chance to buy it a lot lower are we buying it back yet no uh but um we&#39;re keeping a close eye on it there just too many other great things to do uh yeah 15% NASDAQ draw down I think that wasn&#39;t even as of let&#39;s see yeah uh Russell gave back some gains too so that happened but keep in mind the outperformance the 12 months following the first cut number one number two this is was kind of a global deleveraging scare uh credit unwind we&#39;re probably going to find out as I shared with uh Charles that a couple of funds blew up from margin calls and over leverage over the weekend and this stuff will get back to normal The Narrative will get back to the normal why because it&#39;s underpinned by earnings and uh uh small cap earnings are going to grow dramatically faster than large cap uh over the next 12 months which is supportive of them outperforming after the first cut as you can see the Russell fell a lot less than the NASDAQ vix got up to 65 which is normally a sign of massive capitulation on Monday and um it looks that way but don&#39;t be shocked if there are some after effects for the next few days there&#39;ll be funds blowing up Margin Call liquidating so you&#39;re going to have some aftershocks just accept that use it as the opportunity but on balance we remain constructive for the next six to seven weeks uh cyclicals versus defensives you know they got smoked out here&#39;s the Nik and it fell a lot more than this by the way this is from August 5th um unbelievable this is remember all through this period I was saying do not get trapped everyone wanted wanted to buy Japanese equities hand over fist their demographics are crap they have no the Japan is where China will be five years from now okay but we&#39;re going to get a parabolic move in China before then is our base case and the unwinding of the Yen carry trade and getting all this hot Chinese money out of Japan uh is going to be very positive for Chinese equities the Yuan strength positive the uh bond yield starting to go up positive all the things that we need to see China and even CH uh China Services PMI went up this week which was positive to see we&#39;re going to see some earnings in the next few weeks which is also positive Nik volatility over 75 unbelievable Yen absolutely collapsing remember all this period here you were all probably thinking for two months I was saying the yen is going to you want to get long the Yen you to get long the end and short the dollar and this was one of the biggest moves in history that we just saw\n### TECHNICAL_CHARTS\nand it&#39;s setting things up for everything we need to do that&#39;s the Som rule that we already discussed three-month moving anyway we we know what that is um go back to the Liz claiming tape twoyear inflation swap 10year Break Even rate inflation break evens are now nearing 2% which mean means inflation is not only not a problem but deflation is starting to come into view if they don&#39;t move aggressive ly or they don&#39;t move quickly I think all they really need to do is be doish like you saw with ghouls be yesterday if something breaks will fix it which is kind of not the ideal strategy uh but da also said that she&#39;s not worried about it but we&#39;re still going to give accommodative policy very soon average hourly warning earnings collapsing this is what I talk about when I talk about demographics India too early The Sweet Spot is 30 to 40 when the bulk of the population is 35 to 40 you get the most amount of equity gains and economic gains in the shortest amount of time because that&#39;s when people spend the most in their life cycle China you&#39;ve got that right now uh but as you look out five years from now they&#39;re all going to be over 40 in ch India you&#39;re not even close there India is going to be what you want to play after you take all your profits in China five years out and us is in a great situation also with a ton of millennials at 35 and that will continue to be pretty strong uh throughout 2050 and Beyond we have a pretty good situation because of immigration because of Millennials Etc birth rate is better than other places India I think is going to be the best place to invest probably from 20 30 to 2050 I think you&#39;ll make the most amount of money in the shortest amount of time in India I think it&#39;s too early right now and they need a lot more development uh summer olympics of course the United States dominated Wake Me Up When SE September Ends August both normally and in election year does fine September is when things get spotty worst month of the year which is why if we get the strength we expect into September that&#39;s when we would start to put on some tactical Hedges tactical shorts raise some cash to buy in the hole in September and early October head of the election when fear is acute S&P 500 returns following 5% pullbacks uh this shows the percent of time positive is more than uh 80% 6 months out 85% 6 months out 80% 3 months out 70% one month out the median return one month out is 3% um 3 months out is 5% 6 months out is 7% and 12 months out is 11% so they&#39;re basically saying buy the dip this is from macro charts showing that basically the put call skew got so lopsided this is usually times you want to be a buyer not a seller then 5% pullbacks occur more than three times a year on average so this is pretty normal stuff 10% pullbacks occur one time per year on average this is all data going back to 1930 sometimes when you burden yourself with the facts it puts things in perspective and puts you at ease during these opportunities 15% Corrections occur every other year on average and 20% pullbacks occur every 3 to four years on average which is consistent with um with recessions now we&#39;ve already had 2 20% pullbacks in the last four years so we&#39;re do to not have one for some time we had one in 2020 and we had one in 2022 both times we had recession so we&#39;re actually pulled forward a lot of recession and 20% drawbacks therefore we should only be looking more likely for our average 10% a year which we got more than that in the NASDAQ I think we came close Peak to trough in the SNP and um and the 5% pullbacks that those are going to come three times a year no matter what you do I think we&#39;ve had two already we&#39;ll probably get the third one in September October this was an excerpt from an article in bar uh Bloomberg China becoming appealing the violent reaction increases the probability of rotation to Chinese equities from Japan says Frank Ben benra strategist at sgen Chinese equities have low valuations and tend to be relatively more insulated during Global stress the quote irrational selloff in Asia has made under own China an opportunity said William y director at Invesco Hong Kong over the last 2 to 3 years China&#39;s positioning for fund managers has probably been one of the lowest in history we covered that with Charles in the context of multiple Global macro risk emerging recently we see mainland China as a relative defensive especially since many of the country specific risks appear to be already priced in you think um Chinese stocks outperformed Global during the global market route while everything else was up Mainland what China while everything else was getting shellacked the topics Etc uh down 25% Chinese stocks were out performing which is amazing haven&#39;t had it&#39;s it&#39;s exciting to see let&#39;s just put it that way ISM services are going up new ERS up mortgage rates are going down that&#39;s a positive thing that&#39;s also going to help refinancing uh commercial properties that&#39;s going to help refinancing multif family where there&#39;s pockets of distress that&#39;s going to help refinancing small cap companies all positive things uh number of Britain&#39;s expecting the economy to get better over the next year reaches 2-year High we&#39;ve been talking about the UK recovery gxo Etc magnificent 7 Drew Down uh looks like 18% uh so far and uh that was another thing we were calling for for a few months and then it\n",

supply of labor which we&#39;ve been waiting for for uh the excess savings to run out so people had to go to work by the way this is my beautiful hedge fund tips mug from my friends in Dallas and as

benefit\n### HEADLINES_AND_NEWS\nBank of England cutting foreign investors dumped most Japan stocks since September of 2022 this number was as of August 2nd I&#39;m sure this was probably the most Japan stocks ever we&#39;ve been saying forever don&#39;t get sucked into Japan it&#39;s now down 25 fell 25% in 3 days or four days the uh topics did and the Nik similar amounts um economic surprise index uh UK is going up we like that recovery story we&#39;ll talk a little bit about gxo not we&#39;ll maybe go into more detail with gxo next week and what did private clients buy last week before uh Japan collapsed is they bought Japanese equities at the top and got their faces ripped off August does well in election years we&#39;re still of that camp which we covered last week we think we&#39;re going to see strength into the first cut which is late September and then we&#39;re going to see uh sell the news into the election and a year-end rally is our base case this is the chart that I referenced with Charles on making money with Charles pain on Fox Business we there&#39;s a uh back lag of global liquidity coming to Bear the most Global Central Bank Cuts since May of 2020 did you want to be a buyer or a seller of equities in May 2020 you wanted to be a massive buyer so we&#39;ve had 35 Cuts in the last 3 months uh in May of 2022 we had 92 Cuts globally and in April 2009 we had 76 Cuts so I would imagine in the next month two months three months we&#39;re going to see this up to 60 Cuts around the globe which is the perfect environment to be a buyer not a seller of equities uh that was the NASDAQ I think corrected 15% Peak to trough we were fortunate as you guys can go back to the tapes uh of taking a bunch of the uh alphabet and Amazon reluctantly by the way saying we hate taking this but we&#39;re going to have a chance to buy it a lot lower are we buying it back yet no uh but um we&#39;re keeping a close eye on it there just too many other great things to do uh yeah 15% NASDAQ draw down I think that wasn&#39;t even as of let&#39;s see yeah uh Russell gave back some gains too so that happened but keep in mind the outperformance the 12 months following the first cut number one number two this is was kind of a global deleveraging scare uh credit unwind we&#39;re probably going to find out as I shared with uh Charles that a couple of funds blew up from margin calls and over leverage over the weekend and this stuff will get back to normal The Narrative will get back to the normal why because it&#39;s underpinned by earnings and uh uh small cap earnings are going to grow dramatically faster than large cap uh over the next 12 months which is supportive of them outperforming after the first cut as you can see the Russell fell a lot less than the NASDAQ vix got up to 65 which is normally a sign of massive capitulation on Monday and um it looks that way but don&#39;t be shocked if there are some after effects for the next few days there&#39;ll be funds blowing up Margin Call liquidating so you&#39;re going to have some aftershocks just accept that use it as the opportunity but on balance we remain constructive for the next six to seven weeks uh cyclicals versus defensives you know they got smoked out here&#39;s the Nik and it fell a lot more than this by the way this is from August 5th um unbelievable this is remember all through this period I was saying do not get trapped everyone wanted wanted to buy Japanese equities hand over fist their demographics are crap they have no the Japan is where China will be five years from now okay but we&#39;re going to get a parabolic move in China before then is our base case and the unwinding of the Yen carry trade and getting all this hot Chinese money out of Japan uh is going to be very positive for Chinese equities the Yuan strength positive the uh bond yield starting to go up positive all the things that we need to see China and even CH uh China Services PMI went up this week which was positive to see we&#39;re going to see some earnings in the next few weeks which is also positive Nik volatility over 75 unbelievable Yen absolutely collapsing remember all this period here you were all probably thinking for two months I was saying the yen is going to you want to get long the Yen you to get long the end and short the dollar and this was one of the biggest moves in history that we just saw\n### TECHNICAL_CHARTS\nand it&#39;s setting things up for everything we need to do that&#39;s the Som rule that we already discussed three-month moving anyway we we know what that is um go back to the Liz claiming tape twoyear inflation swap 10year Break Even rate inflation break evens are now nearing 2% which mean means inflation is not only not a problem but deflation is starting to come into view if they don&#39;t move aggressive ly or they don&#39;t move quickly I think all they really need to do is be doish like you saw with ghouls be yesterday if something breaks will fix it which is kind of not the ideal strategy uh but da also said that she&#39;s not worried about it but we&#39;re still going to give accommodative policy very soon average hourly warning earnings collapsing this is what I talk about when I talk about demographics India too early The Sweet Spot is 30 to 40 when the bulk of the population is 35 to 40 you get the most amount of equity gains and economic gains in the shortest amount of time because that&#39;s when people spend the most in their life cycle China you&#39;ve got that right now uh but as you look out five years from now they&#39;re all going to be over 40 in ch India you&#39;re not even close there India is going to be what you want to play after you take all your profits in China five years out and us is in a great situation also with a ton of millennials at 35 and that will continue to be pretty strong uh throughout 2050 and Beyond we have a pretty good situation because of immigration because of Millennials Etc birth rate is better than other places India I think is going to be the best place to invest probably from 20 30 to 2050 I think you&#39;ll make the most amount of money in the shortest amount of time in India I think it&#39;s too early right now and they need a lot more development uh summer olympics of course the United States dominated Wake Me Up When SE September Ends August both normally and in election year does fine September is when things get spotty worst month of the year which is why if we get the strength we expect into September that&#39;s when we would start to put on some tactical Hedges tactical shorts raise some cash to buy in the hole in September and early October head of the election when fear is acute S&P 500 returns following 5% pullbacks uh this shows the percent of time positive is more than uh 80% 6 months out 85% 6 months out 80% 3 months out 70% one month out the median return one month out is 3% um 3 months out is 5% 6 months out is 7% and 12 months out is 11% so they&#39;re basically saying buy the dip this is from macro charts showing that basically the put call skew got so lopsided this is usually times you want to be a buyer not a seller then 5% pullbacks occur more than three times a year on average so this is pretty normal stuff 10% pullbacks occur one time per year on average this is all data going back to 1930 sometimes when you burden yourself with the facts it puts things in perspective and puts you at ease during these opportunities 15% Corrections occur every other year on average and 20% pullbacks occur every 3 to four years on average which is consistent with um with recessions now we&#39;ve already had 2 20% pullbacks in the last four years so we&#39;re do to not have one for some time we had one in 2020 and we had one in 2022 both times we had recession so we&#39;re actually pulled forward a lot of recession and 20% drawbacks therefore we should only be looking more likely for our average 10% a year which we got more than that in the NASDAQ I think we came close Peak to trough in the SNP and um and the 5% pullbacks that those are going to come three times a year no matter what you do I think we&#39;ve had two already we&#39;ll probably get the third one in September October this was an excerpt from an article in bar uh Bloomberg China becoming appealing the violent reaction increases the

    "### HEADLINES_AND_NEWS": "\n\n### MEDIA_APPEARANCE_RECAP\nand then I had the pleasure to join Charles Payne on Monday to talk about the Japanese currency trade Japanese carry trade unwind some picks and a lot more thanks to Nick Palazo and Charles for having me on we&#39;re going to listen in now all right so the overarching rationale for the FED not the cut rates is that it would Panic the markets and listen I get that in most cases in life you don&#39;t want to panic but I got to tell you I have personally been in positions and play uh where those knee-jerk moves saved my life right and and also times it saved me financially from a lot of Heartache I&#39;m going to Bringing out great Hill Capital chairman uh Thomas Hayes Thomas so I know you&#39;re one of those study Edy guys check out your posture right just cool and easy like a modern day Paul Newman right but uh you know it&#39;s it&#39;s like the whole steady crowd doesn&#39;t want the FED to overreact by the same token though the markets are pushing them around right and of course you have to wonder how much things have changed since the moves from the bank of Jaan I mean the feds doesn&#39;t just have to deal within the context of us but it&#39;s also got other central banks around the world that are making aggressive moves yeah this is a big deal I think the carry trade onwi is actually pretty important you had the Nik drop 25% in a very short amount of time basically what you have is the funding currency the Japanese Yen institutions were borrowing that for free to buy the most crowded trades the Magnificent Sev so as the cost of capital went up they had to return that capital and unwind the The Magnificent Seven trades so it&#39;s like the FED as the bank of Japan hiked had the opportunity to cut to make up that that ill liquidity they didn&#39;t do that so where&#39;s the liquidity going to come from we&#39;ve had 35 Central Bank Cuts globally in the past 3 months the last time we had that many Cuts was in 2020 April 2020 we had like 95 have we ever had this sort of carry tray relationship with any I mean does do we have like that with the bank of Pakistan or something like that you know what I mean like not being I&#39;m being a little fous here but I&#39;ve never heard of this sort of relationship where like Japanese households were buying buying our tech stocks and buying our treasuries by the way and who buys that now yeah so uh this was pretty big in 2006 and 2007 when you had the lowc cost of capital with the Japanese Yen it&#39;s it&#39;s reworked itself I think now you&#39;ve probably going to find out one or two weeks from now you&#39;ve been around maybe a couple funds blew up over the weekend this felt like abnormal uh selling that we saw structural selling which creates opportunity if you have cash to deploy so let&#39;s talk about that opportunity right now you say we&#39;ve got a declining rate environment declining US dollar and there&#39;s specific areas that historically really work out that&#39;s right uh first and foremost dividend payers that&#39;s nice in a day like today you get a little bit of safety you get a little bit bit of yield while you wait but with lowering rates people want the yield and they&#39;re going to move back from money markets into dividend payers for sure cyclicals we&#39;re seeing the earnings growth of the UNM magnificent 493 accelerate while the Magnificent 7 decelerates cuz margins are compress uh compressing from the cap expend then small caps started to go and they just got whacked last week they&#39;ll be back because the earnings growth is going to go from 4% this year to 177% next year even as is a little less also after the first cut they outperform large caps by 11% in the first 12 months and then International guess which group did the best in the last 5 days China China was only down a few percent while you know the N was down 25% would you buy China specifically or would you buy like I how would you go about this look I&#39;ve been bagged in this stock for like a year and a half I own Alibaba it&#39;s a huge company a huge out the cheapest AI play in the world it&#39;s done nothing for a year and a half I think this is ready to roll they&#39;re going to report on August 15th so I like the environment with a weaker dollar with rates coming down and with the hot money coming out of Japan and back into China could be an opportunity uh we&#39;ve got a minute to go enough time to go over some of your def individual ideas that you like here CCI uh Crown crown castle was on with you uh earlier this Stock&#39;s come up a little bit but you still get a 5.5% yield uh it&#39;s got 40,000 Towers they&#39;re selling the small sale fiber business to delever the balance sheet new CEO Steve MOS I&#39;ve been waiting for this stock to go to the Moon though for like 10 years like yeah it&#39;s gone up like from 100 to 115 you collected a yield in the meantime as rates come down it&#39;ll stay up there&#39;s been doing pretty well lately yeah brought brought to you by spam right I mean they got spam they got Skippy they got Planters this is a steady grower got beat down 3 and half% % yield we like this particularly in a defensive environment right now until we figure out what&#39;s going on and then backer medical supplies medical devices 3.2% yield they&#39;re spinning off the kidney business it&#39;ll rate the multiple back from 10 to a normalized 15 multiple as that gets done toward the end of the year all right so the bottom line though these are defensive you&#39;re getting paid you&#39;re holding quality names you probably sleep better at night that&#39;s right we&#39;ll get offensive again very soon but not just yet all right let me know when thanks a lot Thomas all right folks so um\n### QUOTES_OF_THE_WEEK\nmy next guest and we&#39;re back and then want to get to the quote of the week from SE Seth claran successful investors tend to be unemotional allowing the greed and fear of others to play into their hands by the way this was a great week a great example for that by having confidence in their own analysis and judgment and like we always say know what you own uh they respond to Market forces not with blind emotion but with calculated reason successful investors for example Dem demonstrate caution in frothy markets and steadfast conviction in panicky ones indeed the very way an investor views the market and its price fluctuations is a key factor in his or her ultimate investment success or failure so those of you who have been with us for a while know that we live by this philosophy and many of you have been picking it up for yourselves and benefiting accordingly and then final quote of the week is from Warren Buffett great investment opportunities come around when excellent companies are surrounded by unusual circumstances that cause the stock to be misappreciation first name wrong uh was on Charles Payne saying This Time It&#39;s Different because immigration and covid hiring skew the numbers we will see if that&#39;s the case or not we tend to be in that camp that there same thing with the inverted yield curve two years ago people were saying the curve is inverted we&#39;re going to get a recession I said hey we already had the recession q1 and Q2 of 2022 was a technical recession uh and I think this will prove to be the case as well provided the FED steps in quickly enough and gets that done because these jobless claims numbers and unemployment numbers are moving up the other thing that happened on the jobs report was that more people entered the workforce which is also a positive thing which is why wages are coming down uh and unemployment is going up because there&#39;s a new

especially because the next move in interest rates in the US and Europe is expected to be down the carry trade will almost certainly become a lot less popular who are the winners this is the most important thing and we've been hinting towards this for months and this is key China has the most to gain if the boj continues to raise interest rates thereby strengthening the Yen China and Japan

specific areas that historically really work out that&#39;s right uh first and foremost dividend payers that&#39;s nice in a day like today you get a little bit of safety you get a little bit bit of yield while you wait but with lowering rates people want the yield and they&#39;re going to move back from money markets into dividend payers for sure cyclicals we&#39;re seeing the earnings growth of the UNM magnificent 493 accelerate while the Magnificent 7 decelerates cuz margins are compress uh compressing from the cap expend then small caps started to go and they just got whacked last week they&#39;ll be back because the earnings growth is going to go from 4% this year to 177% next year even as is a little less also after the first cut they outperform large caps by 11% in the first 12 months and then International guess which group did the best in the last 5 days China China was only down a few percent while you know the N was down 25% would you buy China specifically or would you buy like I how would you go about this look I&#39;ve been bagged in this stock for like a year and a half I own Alibaba it&#39;s a huge company a huge out the cheapest AI play in the world it&#39;s done nothing for a year and a half I think this is ready to roll they&#39;re going to report on August 15th so I like the environment with a weaker dollar with rates coming down and with the hot money coming out of Japan and back into China could be an opportunity uh we&#39;ve got a minute to go enough time to go over some of your def individual ideas that you like here CCI uh Crown crown castle was on with you uh earlier this Stock&#39;s come up a little bit but you still get a 5.5% yield uh it&#39;s got 40,000 Towers they&#39;re selling the small sale fiber business to delever the balance sheet new CEO Steve MOS I&#39;ve been waiting for this stock to go to the Moon though for like 10 years like yeah it&#39;s gone up like from 100 to 115 you collected a yield in the meantime as rates come down it&#39;ll stay up there&#39;s been doing pretty well lately yeah brought brought to you by spam right I mean they got spam they got Skippy they got Planters this is a steady grower got beat down 3 and half% % yield we like this particularly in a defensive environment right now until we figure out what&#39;s going on and then backer medical supplies medical devices 3.2% yield they&#39;re spinning off the kidney business it&#39;ll rate the multiple back from 10 to a normalized 15 multiple as that gets done toward the end of the year all right so the bottom line though these are defensive you&#39;re getting paid you&#39;re holding quality names you probably sleep better at night that&#39;s right we&#39;ll get offensive again very soon but not just yet all right let me know when thanks a lot Thomas all right folks so um\n### QUOTES_OF_THE_WEEK\nmy next guest and we&#39;re back and then want to get to the quote of the week from SE Seth claran successful investors tend to be unemotional allowing the greed and fear of others to play into their hands by the way this was a great week a great example for that by having confidence in their own analysis and judgment and like we always say know what you own uh they respond to Market forces not with blind emotion but with calculated reason successful investors for example Dem demonstrate caution in frothy markets and steadfast conviction in panicky ones indeed the very way an investor views the market and its price fluctuations is a key factor in his or her ultimate investment success or failure so those of you who have been with us for a while know that we live by this philosophy and many of you have been picking it up for yourselves and benefiting accordingly and then final quote of the week is from Warren Buffett great investment opportunities come around when excellent companies are surrounded by unusual circumstances that cause the stock to be misappreciation first name wrong uh was on Charles Payne saying This Time It&#39;s Different because immigration and covid hiring skew the numbers we will see if that&#39;s the case or not we tend to be in that camp that there same thing with the inverted yield curve two years ago people were saying the curve is inverted we&#39;re going to get a recession I said hey we already had the recession q1 and Q2 of 2022 was a technical recession uh and I think this will prove to be the case as well provided the FED steps in quickly enough and gets that done because these jobless claims numbers and unemployment numbers are moving up the other thing that happened on the jobs report was that more people entered the workforce which is also a positive thing which is why wages are coming down uh and unemployment is going up because there&#39;s a new supply of labor which we&#39;ve been waiting for for uh the excess savings to run out so people had to go to work by the way this is my beautiful hedge fund tips mug from my friends in Dallas and as always opinions not advice go to hedge fund tips.com and click on terms we deal exclusively with accredited investors and qualified institutions uh check with your financial advisor before you do anything at all labor productivity is going up unit labor costs are going down you can see here Wards Automotive Sales going up that&#39;s a positive thing we&#39;re going to talk about Cooper standard today pretty exciting actually after going through every single word of the transcript and the release uh a lot of good things happening in the way they&#39;re operating and how they&#39;ll benefit\n### HEADLINES_AND_NEWS\nBank of England cutting foreign investors dumped most Japan stocks since September of 2022 this number was as of August 2nd I&#39;m sure this was probably the most Japan stocks ever we&#39;ve been saying forever don&#39;t get sucked into Japan it&#39;s now down 25 fell 25% in 3 days or four days the uh topics did and the Nik similar amounts um economic surprise index uh UK is going up we like that recovery story we&#39;ll talk a little bit about gxo not we&#39;ll maybe go into more detail with gxo next week and what did private clients buy last week before uh Japan collapsed is they bought Japanese equities at the top and got their faces ripped off August does well in election years we&#39;re still of that camp which we covered last week we think we&#39;re going to see strength into the first cut which is late September and then we&#39;re going to see uh sell the news into the election and a year-end rally is our base case this is the chart that I referenced with Charles on making money with Charles pain on Fox Business we there&#39;s a uh back lag of global liquidity coming to Bear the most Global Central Bank Cuts since May of 2020 did you want to be a buyer or a seller of equities in May 2020 you wanted to be a massive buyer so we&#39;ve had 35 Cuts in the last 3 months uh in May of 2022 we had 92 Cuts globally and in April 2009 we had 76 Cuts so I would imagine in the next month two months three months we&#39;re going to see this up to 60 Cuts around the globe which is the perfect environment to be a buyer not a seller of equities uh that was the NASDAQ I think corrected 15% Peak to trough we were fortunate as you guys can go back to the tapes uh of taking a bunch of the uh alphabet and Amazon reluctantly by the way saying we hate taking this but we&#39;re going to have a chance to buy it a lot lower are we buying it back yet no uh but um we&#39;re keeping a close eye on it there just too many other great things to do uh yeah 15% NASDAQ draw down I think that wasn&#39;t even as of let&#39;s see yeah uh Russell gave back some gains too so that happened but keep in mind the outperformance the 12 months following the first cut number one number two this is was kind of a global deleveraging scare uh credit unwind we&#39;re probably going to find out as I shared with uh Charles that a couple of funds blew up from margin calls and over leverage over the weekend and this stuff will get back to normal The Narrative will get back to the normal why because it&#39;s underpinned by earnings and uh uh small cap earnings are going to grow dramatically faster than large cap uh over the next 12 months which is supportive of them outperforming after the first cut as you can see the Russell fell a lot less than the NASDAQ vix got up to 65 which is normally a sign of massive capitulation on Monday and um it looks that way but don&#39;t be shocked if there are some after effects for the next few days there&#39;ll be funds blowing up Margin Call liquidating so you&#39;re going to have some aftershocks just accept that use it as the opportunity but on balance we remain constructive for the next six to seven weeks uh cyclicals versus defensives you know they got smoked out here&#39;s the Nik and it fell a lot more than this by the way this is from August 5th um unbelievable this is remember all through this period I was saying do not get trapped everyone wanted wanted to buy Japanese equities hand over fist their demographics are crap they have no the Japan is where China will be five years from now okay but we&#39;re going to get a parabolic move in China before then is our base case and the unwinding of the Yen carry trade and getting all this hot Chinese money out of Japan uh is going to be very positive for Chinese equities the Yuan strength positive the uh bond yield starting to go up positive all the things that we need to see China and even CH uh China Services PMI went up this week which was positive to see we&#39;re going to see some earnings in the next few weeks which is also positive Nik volatility over 75 unbelievable Yen absolutely collapsing remember all this period here you were all probably thinking for two months I was saying the yen is going to you want to get long the Yen you to get long the end and short the dollar and this was one of the biggest moves in history that we just saw\n### TECHNICAL_CHARTS\nand it&#39;s setting things up for everything we need to do that&#39;s the Som rule that we already discussed three-month moving anyway we we know what that is um go back to the Liz claiming tape twoyear inflation swap 10year Break Even rate inflation break evens are now nearing 2% which mean means inflation is not only not a problem but deflation is starting to come into view if they don&#39;t move aggressive ly or they don&#39;t move quickly I think all they really need to do is be doish like you saw with ghouls be yesterday if something breaks will fix it which is kind of not the ideal strategy uh but da also said that she&#39;s not worried about it but we&#39;re still going to give accommodative policy very soon average hourly warning earnings collapsing this is what I talk about when I talk about demographics India too early The Sweet Spot is 30 to 40 when the bulk of the population is 35 to 40 you get the most amount of equity gains and economic gains in the shortest amount of time because that&#39;s when people spend the most in their life cycle China you&#39;ve got that right now uh but as you look out five years from now they&#39;re all going to be over 40 in ch India you&#39;re not even close there India is going to be what you want to play after you take all your profits in China five years out and us is in a great situation also with a ton of millennials at 35 and that will continue to be pretty strong uh throughout 2050 and Beyond we have a pretty good situation because of immigration because of Millennials Etc birth rate is better than other places India I think is going to be the best place to invest probably from 20 30 to 2050 I think you&#39;ll make the most amount of money in the shortest amount of time in India I think it&#39;s too early right now and they need a lot more development uh summer olympics of course the United States dominated Wake Me Up When SE September Ends August both normally and in election year does fine September is when things get spotty worst month of the year which is why if we get the strength we expect into September that&#39;s when we would start to put on some tactical Hedges tactical shorts raise some cash to buy in the hole in September and early October head of the election when fear is acute S&P 500 returns following 5% pullbacks uh this shows the percent of time positive is more than uh 80% 6 months out 85% 6 months out 80% 3 months out 70% one month out the median return one month out is 3% um 3 months out is 5% 6 months out is 7% and 12 months out is 11% so they&#39;re basically saying buy the dip this is from macro charts showing that basically the put call skew got so lopsided this is usually times you want to be a buyer not a seller then 5% pullbacks occur more than three times a year on average so this is pretty normal stuff 10% pullbacks occur one time per year on average this is all data going back to 1930 sometimes when you burden yourself with the facts it puts things in perspective and puts you at ease during these opportunities 15% Corrections occur every other year on average and 20% pullbacks occur every 3 to four years on average which is consistent with um with recessions now we&#39;ve already had 2 20% pullbacks in the last four years so we&#39;re do to not have one for some time we had one in 2020 and we had one in 2022 both times we had recession so we&#39;re actually pulled forward a lot of recession and 20% drawbacks therefore we should only be looking more likely for our average 10% a year which we got more than that in the NASDAQ I think we came close Peak to trough in the SNP and um and the 5% pullbacks that those are going to come three times a year no matter what you do I think we&#39;ve had two already we&#39;ll probably get the third one in September October this was an excerpt from an article in bar uh Bloomberg China becoming appealing the violent reaction increases the

yesterday 40% draw down uh Vic straight up to 65 let's pull up some of these\n\n### TECHNICAL_CHARTS\ncharts for my friend over there this is from slomer this came out today so you can see in the scheme of things this is not a very big correction so does it pull back all the way down to 4500 that&#39;s what his chart would imply I&#39;m not of that camp I think that this is going to be uh more subdued in nature quick acute deleveraging among leverag funds and um you know maybe that that becomes in play in September October but I don&#39;t think it&#39;s going to come in now this is the monthly seasonality since 1928 that we were referencing you can see here September is the month that we should start to be more concerned election year versus non-election year uh you can see the correction here he&#39;s pointing to 4950 maybe maybe that that&#39;ll be the aftershocks I&#39;m not really in that camp yet I think earnings have been too strong but let&#39;s let&#39;s see what happens sometimes it has nothing to do with earnings it&#39;s just uh margin calls that throw people off this other chart he has takes it down to 5071 NASDAQ already came down to 50 50% retrace trement and um 20,000 to 177,000 so yeah we covered that 18% on the mag 7 40% on Nvidia and let&#39;s see if there&#39;s anything else so small caps this you know it look felt like a lot it&#39;s not really a lot it&#39;s bouncing off this 50-day moving average I think it&#39;s already made its move and this can start to work higher cup and handle back up to new highs uh we like that story supported by earnings not by hope or by chart patterns uh the topics that&#39;s down more than this that&#39;s 81 why does you have an 81 chart on an 86 book that makes that&#39;s lazy uh this probably got all the way down to here let me just see here t o p iix oh n okay n so yeah it got down to 42,000 to 30 31,000 that&#39;s a big drop and now it bounced uh topics weekly that was as of yeah this is a better view I think he just forgot to update that chart this here shows that all the year&#39;s gains have been erased in Tokyo the Hang sang broke out of this downward Trend spiked higher earlier in the year checked back now it&#39;s starting to go back up that&#39;s actually a very nice retracement let&#39;s see how that plays out with earnings uh 10-year yield collapsed down to 370 and change remember we said 375 as a matter of fact we did take off a lot of our TLT on Friday and Monday when it just puked out we had huge profits on some of those uh call spreads and uh made many multiples on those and um I think this will Trend lower but it&#39;s due for a bounce here so we may just put that back on sometime in September and make uh take get two bites at that Apple uh this fell off his chart which is pretty wild this is what we&#39;d expecting looking at the dollar all these things why we continue to emphasize it because they&#39;re key for the China trade uh all falling into place the dollar is weakening collapsed here the Yen all the hot money coming out of Japan Canadian dollar don&#39;t worry you Looney you lunatics Looney loonatics uh Canadian Looney the can Canadian dollar will appreciate against the US dollar coming to a theater near you that&#39;s going to be a great trade uh same thing probably with the Australian dollar as China picks back up probably same with copper\n### MISCELLANEOUS\nuh let&#39;s see if there other any other key charts we want to cover here with him semiconductor equipment huge drop Vago Scott&#39;s Miracle Grow we&#39;ve covered that a few times we do like that stock um all the utilities have absolutely rallied we&#39;ve been talking utilities forever now the hedge funds are getting into them they&#39;re due for a pullback you watch what happens with those uh so if you&#39;ve run with the utilities that we&#39;ve been talking about take some profits now uh and you can probably read those in September and that&#39;s that on that front let&#39;s finish up these other charts spreads blew out a little bit yesterday Global pmis is going up manufacturing that&#39;s good Financial stress going up from that deleveraging yesterday delinquencies going up modestly but not extreme relative to history whe except for student loans because they&#39;ve all a lot of them have been forgiven auto loans are going up uh that will also be helped by lower rates is financing autos which is a big deal earning surprise have been better than the pre-co average Q2 earnings surprise to the upside by 5.5% uh that is better better than plus 3.7% preco average earnings growth was uh 15.3% X energy and financials that&#39;s pretty big uh regular earnings growth was 11.5% all in we&#39;re going to talk about that at the end uh Monday&#39;s vix closing level ranks in the 96 percentile since 1999 some level of capitulation and margin calling going on there which is why we don&#39;t use much leverage um and the largest calendar year Peak to trough S&amp;P draw down uh just about hit looks like it hit about 9% probably probably Futures hit 10% would be my expectation if you do from overnight charts uh you would see that it actually got to a little correction there gxo earnings second quarter Revenue increased 19% year-over-year to a record 2.8 billion with Organic Revenue growth of 2% they signed new business wins of approximately 270 million in annualized revenue and got a sales pipeline increase to the 12-month high of 2.3 billion they completed the the Winton acquisition in the UK which we had talked about uh all of this is positive they generated 115 million of cash flows from operations compared to 61 Million last year and 31 million of free cash flow compared with 3 million of free cash flow last year same quarter that&#39;s a big deal remember this is troughing it the whole world was Goods uh from 2020 to 2022 lot of pull forward then it was uh working through inventory iies from 23 and 24 and now they&#39;re back on track with a more balanced situation which is goods and services which will be positive for their growth going forward so just had to get this plugged in so we don&#39;t lose power there we go uh so we&#39;ll go into gxo the conference call Etc next week we&#39;ve got other ones that we spent more time on for this week\n### FEATURED_COMPANY_DEEP_DIVES\nVF Corp the name of the game with VF Corp is the fact that they&#39;re deleveraging their balance sheets the sales are still down they did have some big turnarounds in China was really really strong I saw as I was going through the numbers today the stock was up pretty big because after the conference call um but the key thing that was important to me okay greater China Allin but it was by brand it was one of the brands that was just off the charts in China we&#39;ll go into it in more detail next week but if you look at the balance sheet um number one they generated let&#39;s get this here okay wanted let&#39;s look at the long-term debt it&#39;s gone from in the last three quarters it&#39;s gone from 5.7 billion to 4.7 billion to 3.9 billion now they got the 1.5 billion coming in from the sale of supreme which are going to take this down again so now their balance Sheet&#39;s going to be in good shape which all you need is free cash flow and a good balance sheet and then you have the runway to turn everything around uh and you&#39;re back Off to the Races so uh let&#39;s see here balance sheet review okay free cash flow turn 31 margin moderated okay so he&#39;s still more energized than ever that&#39;s good to see we&#39;re going to go into this more the conference call was good you could tell by the way the stock acted today and the key is the balance sheet risk is now off the table which is like what we had to go through with Cooper standard and by the way Cooper standard&#39;s debt got upgraded today which is mindboggling and exciting to see uh so next week we&#39;re going to go into VF Corp in a very detailed way but for now um we&#39;re pretty pleased with our first look in their turnaround because the solvency risk which is number one is off the table they&#39;ve got free cash flow they&#39;ve got a good balance sheet now they&#39;re just starting to turn revenues region by region\n### HEADLINES_AND_NEWS\num as for Teemu teu sellers revolt against fines and withheld pay so again we&#39;ve said for months that uh pin duo duo and teu is the number are either unsustainable or unreliable I think it may prove to be a combination of both you can refer back to that article in the financial times this is an article from Barons saying that uh talking about Intel we&#39;re going to cover a lot of Intel today and you know it says from the start G singer said his goal was to achieve leadership and Chip manufacturing by 2025 sure enough Intel&#39;s new processors called Panther Lake are scheduled for release in the second half of 2025 when I asked the senior Intel executive when Intel would\n\nheadlines  are suggesting that further raid hikes may be forthcoming the problem for the Yen however is that volatility remains exceptionally low and the carry trade exceptionally popular is the carry trade dead probably not yet interest rates in Japan are still much lower than elsewhere boj said it will move slowly and cautiously but the decision to raise rates does change the game especially because the next move in interest rates in the US and Europe is expected to be down the carry trade will almost certainly become a lot less popular who are the winners this is the most important thing and we&#39;ve been hinting towards this for months and this is key China has the most to gain if the boj continues to raise interest rates thereby strengthening the Yen China and Japan both rely heavily on exports of things like electronics and cars for economic growth and a stronger Yen compared to the Yuan will make Chinese Goods more attractively priced it will also help to\n### FEATURED_COMPANY_DEEP_DIVES\nfinally  take the Chinese Yuan off the mat and appreciate the Yuan which is the key that we&#39;ve been looking at as it related to our exposure in China expressed in a position in Alibaba and what we&#39;ve been talking about is as the fed eases and the dollar weakend Emerging Markets will get bid and China will be a benefici that is true but what I laid out here which is even more important is the yuan&#39;s relationship to the US dollar and as we can see almost perfectly as the Yuan rallied from 2000 relative to the US dollar the Yuan strengthened uh from 2016 to 2018 Alibaba had a parabolic move the Yuan strength is in Black the Alibaba is in red and you can see as the Yuan went up Alibaba went parabolic the Yuan rolled over Alibaba crashed down and then uh the final rally as the Yuan started to recover you had that parabolic move into 2021 with Ali Baba Yuan rolled over Alibaba and the rest of Chinese and kweb stocks crashed it&#39;s been doing this double bottom and this could have been the sea change we have all been waiting for ladies and gentlemen that we get this double bottom in like we saw in 2019 and 2020 and a parabolic move up and we get the Yuan off the mat Yuan starts to appreciate because the boj&#39;s new policy stance and the fed&#39;s new policy stance uh Yuan being appreciative stance of tightening rates fed being depreciative stance of loosening rates strengthening the Yuan which will cause the flows into China into Chinese equities to explode yet again no one can see that right now until it happens and then this will be the most hated rally all the way up of all time no one will believe it until it hits 200 then they will hate it and then they will join it and that&#39;s what will happen and today was the warning shot fired all around the world following the meeting when the FED confirmed they were going to be doish and they have no choice Bank of Japan has been the liquidity back stop for Global central banks while they got inflation under control for the last two years and now Japan is saying we&#39;ve got inflation coming we want to normalize our policy it&#39;s time for you to back stop us we are going to normalize policy and that is the global coordinated Central Bank policy that has worked so well so now it&#39;s flip-flopping from strong dollar weak Yen uh and weak foreign currencies to now weaker dollar weaker Euro stronger Yen uh Stronger Yen stronger Yuan and that will be great for Chinese equities and I think the misnomer here for everyone chasing Japanese equities is the stronger Japanese Yen despite all the constructive developments as it relates to corporate governance and uh spins and shareholder friendly policies moving in the right direction I do think the stronger Yen will be a headwind the weekend has been H Tailwind for the recent rally in Japanese stocks it will now become a headwind and all the Chinese flows that have come out of China and into Japan are now going to go back home as price starts to change opinion opinion follows Trend and this move here today albeit it doesn&#39;t mean that it&#39;s going to do it tomorrow but it&#39;s the beginning of this regime change that is significantly important for so many of the things that we&#39;re doing and for the global change uh around the world this will also support small caps this will also support RS this will also support dividend payers code value stocks like Stanley Black and&amp; Decker genac 3M all these Industrials that have been waiting to take off natural gas companies like Comstock resources etc etc etc so very excited here the 10year did not know what to do today um it started by collapsing and then it started to get bit up I think what you&#39;re going to see over the next few weeks is while the dollar starts to re weaken the Yen starts to get bid the Yuan starts to strengthen the 10-year bonds are going to slowly climb and yields are going to slowly compress now just as I always said with the FED because most of the time the the move is bad after Powell speaks and I always say don&#39;t get faked out the first move is often the wrong move it may in fact be the case that that could be true this time as well could we be Off to the Races for 19 out of 21 weeks up in US equities it could be that would be great I mean it was very interesting today today I think overall the portfolio is up 2.2% and the general indices were up between 90 basis points and and a buck so you know our Hedges were moving against us but the overall portfolio was outperforming uh the deterioration of the hedges as we&#39;re going to discuss in the article of the week um and it was a great day 2.2% on any day is great um uh it was it was interesting to see and maybe we&#39;ll get even further follow through and this will continue for another four weeks who knows I would be alert uh that that&#39;s all I was going to say as a matter of fact I was going to lean into the hedges today but we already have full 2% of equity Capital that is sufficient to create an extra uh um 10% of free Capital if we&#39;re right on the four to six% pullback over the next couple of months but [Music] um uh you know I wouldn&#39;t number one I wouldn&#39;t be pessimistic because a lot of things are lining up right and we&#39;re going to go through a list of them and number two I wouldn&#39;t be chasing if I wasn&#39;t already fully invested uh either especially in the shiny objects that have already run um because well you might get a few days follow through I would just keep an open mind sometimes that first move is a fake out and let&#39;s see how how it plays out uh in the next few days I think the real underlying move should be a you know as we look out for to to 12 weeks Yen starts to strengthen bonds start to get bid dollar starts to weaken uh Emerging Markets get bid us maybe flattish to down uh could be flat sideways which we discussed you know three four weeks ago we said probably the move that screws the most people is the the indices actually just grind sideways so they take out all the put premium they take out all the call Premium um and and and I&#39;d be open-minded to that because that implies now\n\ncould we be Off to the Races for 19 out of 21 weeks up in US equities it could be that would be great

Q2 revenues dropped 1% year on year and the stock dropped 30% which is something to keep in mind guys to keep things in perspective revenues were down 1% year on-ear the stock dropped 30% year onye so what does Warren Buffett talk about great investment opportunities come around when excellent companies are surrounded by unusual circumstances that caused the stock to be misappreciation in 11 years since 2013 the company also announced the suspension of the dividend starting in Q4 and a layoff of more than 15% of the workforce I spoke with CEO Pat galinger his only broadcast interview right after the analyst call last night starting with the layoff you know it&#39;s hard this is the Intel family so I feel this very deeply at the same time making the steps to have an efficient Intel for the future that has both process and product leadership but also Financial sustainability in the model you know we&#39;re committed to this journey you know this is the most substantial you know uh restructuring of Intel since the I&#39;ll say the memory microprocessor transition four decades ago we have laid out on an audacious journey of rebuilding this company and we&#39;re going to get that done and today&#39;s uh announcement is accelerating the financial piece of that even as we build on the product and process capab abilities that we&#39;ve put in place I asked Ginger about the reasoning Behind These Cuts aside from the immediate need to preserve cash we&#39;re making these cuts to build a more efficient Intel and what happened at the beginning of the year was We disclosed this new financial model the new operating model of Intel a worldclass fabulous company and a world-class Foundry Company we began a clean sheet analysis of the two pieces of the business and we said what does worldclass look like for each of those uh businesses because we were operating in the old model for five decades and that clean sheet exercise led us to say these are the changes that we need to be an efficient Nimble company for the future that&#39;s what&#39;s driving the restructuring that you&#39;ve heard us announced today the financial performance accelerated that a bit but the work was already launched and underway from the start of the year and now we want to get them done quickly so that we have this new operational model in place and fully supported by a more efficient organization so we expect the majority of these will be finished uh this year so that we&#39;re able to have a more efficient effective Intel Foundry Intel products and an overall Intel delivering product and process leadership with financial performance as well I also asked G singer why an investor seeing the stock plummet today and seeing the dividend suspension would put money in now well we believe that those foundational Investments are realizing beginning now right these new products we&#39;re seeing them come to life you know for instance the aipc is a great example of that we have the leadership product today with core Ultra we&#39;re about to announce the next generation of that at the EA show uh coming up next month you know lunar Lake our second generation core Ultra you know unquestioned leadership and performance and AI capabilities dramatic improvements and power you know our next Generation server products are shipping this quarter so I&#39;ll say all of this hard work that we&#39;ve done starts to materialize now and I think we&#39;ve reset the financial expectations now and we&#39;ve taken the steps that you know the markets should look at and say wow they are really getting their house in order for a efficient Intel building on the leadership Intel work of the last three years now is the opportunity to start benefiting from those and we believe that the guidance that we&#39;ve given is now you know well placed in the market the steps were taking you know well respected and with the products and the technology we&#39;re now well positioned to begin a very solid cycle you know for the Intel of the future this has been heavy lifting and we&#39;re now confident that building on that we can go forward effectively in the market for the future uh it was a tough quarter a few back and the Hope was that there was a trajectory after that point that would be more predictable we&#39;re here now um and it sounds like you&#39;re saying that again at what point do we know that those kinds of surprises and the needs for realignment are out of the way or is this just such a a rocky period uh for Intel and the the changes that are needed in the industry that you can&#39;t say clearly you know this has been a challenging rebuild this has been an audacious rebuilding of Intel one that I&#39;m proud of the work that we&#39;ve done you know rebuilding a company like this is heavy work we always said it was going to be a five plus year Journey here we are three years in we&#39;ve accomplished the most significant process technology you know cycle people didn&#39;t think it was possible now the end is clearly in sight as we&#39;ve released the pdk the products have come to life These are significant Milestones ones that people thought were impossible three years ago they&#39;re now done John you know and building on that these new products that we&#39;re bringing these are competitive products you know we&#39;re no longer in a position that we&#39;re losing market share because we have inadequate products and our AI products aipc our gouty 3 that we&#39;re beginning to ship this quarter you know all of these things are now coming together so yes I understand some of those concerns but I&#39;d also say look at what we&#39;ve gotten done this is incredible what we&#39;ve gotten done and we&#39;re now combining that with the steps to build a more efficient Intel this is the most significant rebuilding of Intel in four plus decades I&#39;m proud of the work we&#39;ve gotten done and we&#39;re committed to finish the job and we are well on our way to do exactly that a lot riding on gudy 3 as that launches in Rams and aipc we&#39;ll see where Intel goes from here and we&#39;re back so I put out a note after earnings which I usually don&#39;t do by the way way on Twitter X and I said I quoted him launching in Q3 you know the big thing\n\n### FEATURED_COMPANY_DEEP_DIVES\nbe more predictable we&#39;re here now um and it sounds like you&#39;re saying that again at what point do we know that those kinds of surprises and the needs for realignment are out of the way or is this just such a a rocky period uh for Intel and the the changes that are needed in the industry that you can&#39;t say clearly you know this has been a challenging rebuild this has been an audacious rebuilding of Intel one that

from here and we&#39;re back so I put out a note after earnings which I usually don&#39;t do by the way way on Twitter X and I said I quoted him launching in Q3 you know the big thing here is\n\nlater but they can buy it from us down the road at 80 or 100 bucks we&#39;ll be happy to help them out when they get excited and they actually start to read stuff launching Q3 launching in Q3 Intel gouty 3 will take our accelerator performance to the next level at just 2/3 of the cost of competitive offerings to put it in perspective we expect gy 3 to deliver roughly two times performance per dollar on both inference and hand and training versus h100 nvidia&#39;s h100 gy 3 has a strong ecosystem supporting Dell Technologies huet Packard Enterprise Lenovo super micro foxcon gigabyte inventech Quant Cloud technology and wion then they talk about their Intel Zeon 6 code named Sierra Forest 25% better performance versus competitors Granite rapid Rapids we&#39;ll be shipping later this quarter that&#39;s also off the 18a server product everything is falling in place 130 million xeons powering data centers around the world today greater delivery performance efficiency so people forget this is a business that&#39;s still doing $50 billion a year yes margin have contracted yes they didn&#39;t get their the new products out quickly enough but they still have unbelievable franchise no one can compete with them on the aipc refresh they&#39;re going to do 40 million uh they&#39;ve already done 15 million they&#39;re going to get the GPU chips out cheaper faster better um Revenue will bounce back by Q4 and the five nodes in four years are done and then the other thing you look at adjusted free cash flow you look at some of the things that are up certainly Data Center and AI was down not good total Intel products operating income was up operating segment Revenue was up so the key things that matter desktop notebook everything was up materially it was some of these other non-core Altera the bed okay and it was down from 848 million to 361 it&#39;s in their all other category this is their stuff that they don&#39;t care about anymore like mobile ey uh and eventually they will completely divest of so if you put it in perspective uh lunar Lake our next Generation aipc which achieved production release ahead of schedule in July will be the next industrywide Catalyst for the device refresh lunar Lake delivers Superior performance at half the power with 50% better graphics performance and 40% more power efficiency versus the prior generation three time more tops gen on gen so each thing is getting better and better for lower and lower costs which will create competition in the marketplace ### FEATURED_COMPANY_DEEP_DIVES\nCooper standard so I read this Moody upgrading by the way see our historic thesis and updates for Cooper standard since May of 2022 when we entered the position at a basis in the low fives    okay so just today Cooper standard debt got upgraded okay and what they say is okay the upgrades reflect a strong Rebound in earning since 2022 that has led to significantly lower leverage improved liquidity and reduced risk of further debt restructuring under the still burdensome capital structure debt capital structure sustainable price adjustments and cost recoveries from customers a transition to a more index-based commodity input cost contracts and rigorous focus on continuous Improvement Have Been instrumental in generating improved operating results in addition headcount reductions announced in mid 2022 are expected to generate 20 to 25 million in Savings in the second half of 2024 and generate annualized Savings of at least 40 million beginning in 2 modest returns and our expectation for negative free cash flow through 2024 since 2023 the company has stemmed the margin erosion it had experienced prior from operating inefficiencies caused by lower and uneven vehicle production volumes as well as challenging cost input environment Cooper standard maintains solid Market positions in ceiling systems and Fuel and Brake Delivery Systems and fluid transfer systems where demand fundamentals are largely drivetrain agnostic a product M mix skewed towards SUVs cuvs and light trucks including content on top selling vehicle platforms help mitigate the competitive highly fragmented nature in core and end markets the stable Outlook reflects our expectation that supply chain cost reductions from lean initiatives and heightened focus on continuous Improvement will help sustain current returns ongoing rationalization of cost structure combined with higher margin new platform launches replace ing lower performing programs should help offset the impact of softening Global light vehicle production volumes and enable margin expansion through 2025    reflects our expectation that the company will maintain adequate liquidity cash balance of about 100 million even with the negative free cash flow why do they have negative free cash flow because they&#39;re now   they elected not to do the pick they&#39;re doing cash pay on the debt contributing to cash shortfall is the expiration of the pick options on the security notes in 2025 we do anticipate the company to make progress toward generating positive and sustainable free cash flow in 2025 the undrawn 180 million asset back lending facility had availability of 173 million at June 30th 2024 the abbl was amended in 2024 extending the expiration date to 2029 and reducing the facility to 150 million from 180 million beginning March of 2025 okay so that&#39;s not me and that&#39;s not Cooper standard writing all of those good words about Cooper standard that is Moody&#39;s a debt rating agency writing that about Cooper standard so what did they do they dram even though car volumes have not come up and they&#39;ve actually come down   they were expected to be 16.1 million they&#39;re only 15.8 million expected they were able to grow their margin profile so their gross profit   was 82 million an increase of 6.7 versus the same quarter last year new business award 60.6 million but the key is we&#39;re going to get into some of these key things here as we get into the earnings called transcript   you see the fluid Handling Systems grew by about 5 million the decline in Revenue was just due to the business that they sold that was no longer included so if you add back the business that was in from the quarter that they&#39;re comparing to their revenues were up modestly even though volumes were down because of the efficiencies   and because of their improved products and improved pricing the overall guidance   stayed basically the same adjusted eida 180 to0 million versus 180 to 210 and that includes the cash pay they were deciding whether they were going to cash pay they decided to cash pay which shows they have confidence of the back half of the Year business and they&#39;ve got still got 266 million doll of liquidity you can see where they gained in adjusted eBid year on-year was their manufacturing and purchasing efficiencies volume and mix and their savings from restructuring which is going to come up even more this year and then year-to date same three areas   improved and you can see why the sales were just a hair less 27 million of the revenues 1.4 billion to 1.38 billion you lost 27 million from the tire European entire business that they sold which was non-profitable   otherwise their net sales were actually up year on-ear   so they&#39;ve got more cost savings coming you can see the 80% more parts for hybrids than IC and there are some key points here look at the debt maturities   nothing until 2026 they&#39;ve got 43 million and then 2027 so they&#39;re going to refinance between now and 2027 3 years from now   they get a couple quarters of positive free cash flow rates come down if they do 250 basis point cuts and refinance the whole thing take their debt thing down and push it out to 2030 which is all the runway they need for volumes to come back in the meantime they are operating like Simone bils on a   on a on a walking plank   getting gold medals because their margins continue to go up they&#39;re extracting more and more profits out of less and less volume that volume will come back   and they cut out another 16 millions of savings through Leen it initiatives and other cost programs they improved their gross margin by 100 basis points compared to the second quarter of last year and 61 million of net new business Awards they outpaced   Global Automotive production which declined by 0.5%   their revenues were actually up 1% when you back out the divesture so they outper formed by 150 basis points in terms of Topline gross profit for the second quarter was 11% 11.7% of sales this compares to 10.7% of sales in the second quarter of 2023 adjusted eida was 50.9 Million compared to 47.9 million   so that&#39;s positive they&#39;re getting more with less and wait till they have more with more is going to be a big deal   despite lower sales despite lower sales our business was actually more efficient as grow gross profit increased to 144.5 million for the first half of the year and gross profit margin improved by 90 basis points versus the first half of 2023 adjusted evit for the half was 80.3 Million up 33% versus the prior year 6 months and the technical rubber fature was 15 million $9 million of improvement for the quarter manufacturing liquidity 267 million okay this is very important   and I&#39;ll probably see them at JP Morgan on Thursday if I can get to a flight afterwards it we got to move some things around we&#39;ll see   let me assure you that we&#39;re 100% focused on this task they&#39;re talking about deleveraging and refinancing given our leadership frameless   ceiling system growing at 30% kager for the next 5 years go through this at the hedge fund tips.com there&#39;s so much amazing stuff in here I I saw the headline I was like H that&#39;s a mediocre quarter and then as I read through it I was pretty excited with what I saw and particularly in the question and answer period   was especially exciting cuz he said hey wanted to follow up on Mike&#39;s\n\n### FEATURED_COMPANY_DEEP_DIVES\nmore and more profits out of less and less volume that volume will come back um

particularly in the question and answer period uh was especially exciting cuz he said hey wanted to follow up on Mike&#39;s questions  on the margins I guess at least 10% EIT a margin without volume growth doing the math that would imply 270 million of eida exiting 2025 am I doing the math right Jeffrey Edwards says yes you&#39;re doing the math right I mean if they do 270 million of eida exiting 2025 remember going back to 2027 uh 2017 when they earned $7 a share they were doing about 400 million you know we&#39;re starting to knock on the door here as the quarters move and once the volume ramps up to 16 16 and a half with all of the cuts and the pricing agreements that they have in place I think when they&#39;re doing similar volumes they&#39;re going to wind up doing a lot more than the seven that they were able to do so uh this and they continue to emphasize getting to double digit return on invested Capital doubleit digit adjusted eida margins and everything else so that&#39;s that fear and greed down to 21 that&#39;s times to be a buyer not a seller uh and you&#39;ll probably get a few opportunities over the coming days\n\nbut when how or and or would you add to a position once it starts to move up um never that&#39;s me I buy down not up I buy red days not green days uh if you need an actual stock we can use CPS as an example no I just buy CP PS when it&#39;s red and I have cash period that&#39;s very simple uh I never buy it when it&#39;s going up or or green ### FEATURED_COMPANY_DEEP_DIVES\nuh and we got plenty so we&#39;re happy with our positioning we&#39;re happy with our basis and now we&#39;re just going to let John Edwards and team Jeff Edwards and John vanis uh work their magic continue to execute until the volume I mean they&#39;ve basically got this thing running like such a well-oiled machine at such low volumes that they could be cash flow positive next year assuming no growth in volumes when volumes are going to grow when the average car on the road is 13.5 years and the average Millennial is 33 years old that&#39;s when they buy they buy the most cars and dishwashers with for those of you who have asked me about whirlpool and homes and baby stuff between 33 and 40 and this time will be no different and they&#39;re going to be the beneficiary so fact they can go cash flow positive in the next year assuming no volume growth when volume growth is going to come back uh rates are going to come lower inventories are going to go up uh oems are going to start to give incentives volumes are going to start to go through the roof margins for oems will go down but um that all we care about is volumes and they will be a key beneficiary so uh hope that answers your question",
    "TECHNICAL_CHARTS": "\n\n### TECHNICAL_CHARTS\ncharts for my friend over there this is from slomer this came out today so you can see in the scheme of things this is not a very big correction so does it pull back all the way down to 4500 that&#39;s what his chart would imply I&#39;m not of that camp I think that this is going to be uh more subdued in nature quick acute deleveraging among leverag funds and um you know maybe that that becomes in play in September October but I don&#39;t think it&#39;s going to come in now this is the monthly seasonality since 1928 that we were referencing you can see here September is the month that we should start to be more concerned election year versus non-election year uh you can see the correction here he&#39;s pointing to 4950 maybe maybe that that&#39;ll be the aftershocks I&#39;m not really in that camp yet I think earnings have been too strong but let&#39;s let&#39;s see what happens sometimes it has nothing to do with earnings it&#39;s just uh margin calls that throw people off this other chart he has takes it down to 5071 NASDAQ already came down to 50 50% retrace trement and um 20,000 to 177,000 so yeah we covered that 18% on the mag 7 40% on Nvidia and let&#39;s see if there&#39;s anything else so small caps this you know it look felt like a lot it&#39;s not really a lot it&#39;s bouncing off this 50-day moving average I think it&#39;s already made its move and this can start to work higher cup and handle back up to new highs uh we like that story supported by earnings not by hope or by chart patterns uh the topics that&#39;s down more than this that&#39;s 81 why does you have an 81 chart on an 86 book that makes that&#39;s lazy uh this probably got all the way down to here let me just see here t o p iix oh n okay n so yeah it got down to 42,000 to 30 31,000 that&#39;s a big drop and now it bounced uh topics weekly that was as of yeah this is a better view I think he just forgot to update that chart this here shows that all the year&#39;s gains have been erased in Tokyo the Hang sang broke out of this downward Trend spiked higher earlier in the year checked back now it&#39;s starting to go back up that&#39;s actually a very nice retracement let&#39;s see how that plays out with earnings uh 10-year yield collapsed down to 370 and change remember we said 375 as a matter of fact we did take off a lot of our TLT on Friday and Monday when it just puked out we had huge profits on some of those uh call spreads and uh made many multiples on those and um I think this will Trend lower but it&#39;s due for a bounce here so we may just put that back on sometime in September and make uh take get two bites at that Apple uh this fell off his chart which is pretty wild this is what we&#39;d expecting looking at the dollar all these things why we continue to emphasize it because they&#39;re key for the China trade uh all falling into place the dollar is weakening collapsed here the Yen all the hot money coming out of Japan Canadian dollar don&#39;t worry you Looney you lunatics Looney loonatics uh Canadian Looney the can Canadian dollar will appreciate against the US dollar coming to a theater near you that&#39;s going to be a great trade uh same thing probably with the Australian dollar as China picks back up probably same with copper\n### MISCELLANEOUS\nuh let&#39;s see if there other any other key charts we want to cover here with him semiconductor equipment huge drop Vago Scott&#39;s Miracle Grow we&#39;ve covered that a few times we do like that stock um all the utilities have absolutely rallied we&#39;ve been talking utilities forever now the hedge funds are getting into them they&#39;re due for a pullback you watch what happens with those uh so if you&#39;ve run with the utilities that we&#39;ve been talking about take some profits now uh and you can probably read those in September and that&#39;s that on that front let&#39;s finish up these other charts spreads blew out a little bit yesterday Global pmis is going up manufacturing that&#39;s good Financial stress going up from that deleveraging yesterday delinquencies going up modestly but not extreme relative to history whe except for student loans because they&#39;ve all a lot of them have been forgiven auto loans are going up uh that will also be helped by lower rates is financing autos which is a big deal earning surprise have been better than the pre-co average Q2 earnings surprise to the upside by 5.5% uh that is better better than plus 3.7% preco average earnings growth was uh 15.3% X energy and financials that&#39;s pretty big uh regular earnings growth was 11.5% all in we&#39;re going to talk about that at the end uh Monday&#39;s vix closing level ranks in the 96 percentile since 1999 some level of capitulation and margin calling going on there which is why we don&#39;t use much leverage um and the largest calendar year Peak to trough S&amp;P draw down uh just about hit looks like it hit about 9% probably probably Futures hit 10% would be my expectation if you do from overnight charts uh you would see that it actually got to a little correction there gxo earnings second quarter Revenue increased 19% year-over-year to a record 2.8 billion with Organic Revenue growth of 2% they signed new business wins of approximately 270 million in annualized revenue and got a sales pipeline increase to the 12-month high of 2.3 billion they completed the the Winton acquisition in the UK which we had talked about uh all of this is positive they generated 115 million of cash flows from operations compared to 61 Million last year and 31 million of free cash flow compared with 3 million of free cash flow last year same quarter that&#39;s a big deal remember this is troughing it the whole world was Goods uh from 2020 to 2022 lot of pull forward then it was uh working through inventory iies from 23 and 24 and now they&#39;re back on track with a more balanced situation which is goods and services which will be positive for their growth going forward so just had to get this plugged in so we don&#39;t lose power there we go uh so we&#39;ll go into gxo the conference call Etc next week we&#39;ve got other ones that we spent more time on for this week\n### FEATURED_COMPANY_DEEP_DIVES\nVF Corp the name of the game with VF Corp is the fact that they&#39;re deleveraging their balance sheets the sales are still down they did have some big turnarounds in China was really really strong I saw as I was going through the numbers today the stock was up pretty big because after the conference call um but the key thing that was important to me okay greater China Allin but it was by brand it was one of the brands that was just off the charts in China we&#39;ll go into it in more detail next week but if you look at the balance sheet um number one they generated let&#39;s get this here okay wanted let&#39;s look at the long-term debt it&#39;s gone from in the last three quarters it&#39;s gone from 5.7 billion to 4.7 billion to 3.9 billion now they got the 1.5 billion coming in from the sale of supreme which are going to take this down again so now their balance Sheet&#39;s going to be in good shape which all you need is free cash flow and a good balance sheet and then you have the runway to turn everything around uh and you&#39;re back Off to the Races so uh let&#39;s see here balance sheet review okay free cash flow turn 31 margin moderated okay so he&#39;s still more energized than ever that&#39;s good to see we&#39;re going to go into this more the conference call was good you could tell by the way the stock acted today and the key is the balance sheet risk is now off the table which is like what we had to go through with Cooper standard and by the way Cooper standard&#39;s debt got upgraded today which is mindboggling and exciting to see uh so next week we&#39;re going to go into VF Corp in a very detailed way but for now um we&#39;re pretty pleased with our first look in their turnaround because the solvency risk which is number one is off the table they&#39;ve got free cash flow they&#39;ve got a good balance sheet now they&#39;re just starting to turn revenues region by region\n### HEADLINES_AND_NEWS\num as for Teemu teu sellers revolt against fines and withheld pay so again

    "MISCELLANEOUS": "\n\n### TECHNICAL_CHARTS\ncharts for my friend over there this is from slomer this came out today so you can see in the scheme of things this is not a very big correction so does it pull back all the way down to 4500 that&#39;s what his chart would imply I&#39;m not of that camp I think that this is going to be uh more subdued in nature quick acute deleveraging among leverag funds and um you know maybe that that becomes in play in September October but I don&#39;t think it&#39;s going to come in now this is the monthly seasonality since 1928 that we were referencing you can see here September is the month that we should start to be more concerned election year versus non-election year uh you can see the correction here he&#39;s pointing to 4950 maybe maybe that that&#39;ll be the aftershocks I&#39;m not really in that camp yet I think earnings have been too strong but let&#39;s let&#39;s see what happens sometimes it has nothing to do with earnings it&#39;s just uh margin calls that throw people off this other chart he has takes it down to 5071 NASDAQ already came down to 50 50% retrace trement and um 20,000 to 177,000 so yeah we covered that 18% on the mag 7 40% on Nvidia and let&#39;s see if there&#39;s anything else so small caps this you know it look felt like a lot it&#39;s not really a lot it&#39;s bouncing off this 50-day moving average I think it&#39;s already made its move and this can start to work higher cup and handle back up to new highs uh we like that story supported by earnings not by hope or by chart patterns uh the topics that&#39;s down more than this that&#39;s 81 why does you have an 81 chart on an 86 book that makes that&#39;s lazy uh this probably got all the way down to here let me just see here t o p iix oh n okay n so yeah it got down to 42,000 to 30 31,000 that&#39;s a big drop and now it bounced uh topics weekly that was as of yeah this is a better view I think he just forgot to update that chart this here shows that all the year&#39;s gains have been erased in Tokyo the Hang sang broke out of this downward Trend spiked higher earlier in the year checked back now it&#39;s starting to go back up that&#39;s actually a very nice retracement let&#39;s see how that plays out with earnings uh 10-year yield collapsed down to 370 and change remember we said 375 as a matter of fact we did take off a lot of our TLT on Friday and Monday when it just puked out we had huge profits on some of those uh call spreads and uh made many multiples on those and um I think this will Trend lower but it&#39;s due for a bounce here so we may just put that back on sometime in September and make uh take get two bites at that Apple uh this fell off his chart which is pretty wild this is what we&#39;d expecting looking at the dollar all these things why we continue to emphasize it because they&#39;re key for the China trade uh all falling into place the dollar is weakening collapsed here the Yen all the hot money coming out of Japan Canadian dollar don&#39;t worry you Looney you lunatics Looney loonatics uh Canadian Looney the can Canadian dollar will appreciate against the US dollar coming to a theater near you that&#39;s going to be a great trade uh same thing probably with the Australian dollar as China picks back up probably same with copper\n### MISCELLANEOUS\nuh let&#39;s see if there other any other key charts we want to cover here with him semiconductor equipment huge drop Vago Scott&#39;s Miracle Grow we&#39;ve covered that a few times we do like that stock um all the utilities have absolutely rallied we&#39;ve been talking utilities forever now the hedge funds are getting into them they&#39;re due for a pullback you watch what happens with those uh so if you&#39;ve run with the utilities that we&#39;ve been talking about take some profits now uh and you can probably read those in September and that&#39;s that on that front let&#39;s finish up these other charts spreads blew out a little bit yesterday Global pmis is going up manufacturing that&#39;s good Financial stress going up from that deleveraging yesterday delinquencies going up modestly but not extreme relative to history whe except for student loans because they&#39;ve all a lot of them have been forgiven auto loans are going up uh that will also be helped by lower rates is financing autos which is a big deal

accelerate based on fundamentals and the fourth most crowded trade was short China equities and what did better than any other asset class in the last week China equities so uh that is what we&#39;ve been waiting for Global hedge funds actually added Chinese domestic stocks in July says Goldman Sachs this is daily saying a policy adjustment is still coming soon or rather than later even though she&#39;s not worried about anything at all she&#39;s still going to get that policy adjustment happening sooner rather than later in video which we had talked about before it crashed when everyone was clamoring all over each other to get stock after they did the split and sucked in all the new buyers uh Jensen Wong sold 323 million a stock in July before the decline he dumped it all on the retail investors heads so beware when that happens again I think people got wise to it because super micro or some one of those companies reported after the bell and they announced a split and the stock was down 9% uh afterm Market biggest margin debt on wine since 1999 spurred Taiwan Taiwan stock route that&#39;s why we don&#39;t use much leverage Chinese brokerages talk up local stocks after

cut calculus a further slow down in the labor market could lead to a larger Half Point rate cut next month so the FED Whisperer is starting to drop hints about 50 basis point Cuts as a trial balloon for the feds setting the stage that&#39;s pretty interesting China defensive SE sectors win favor as Asian stocks stage rebound and now onto our article of the week like a phoenix From the Ashes\n### MISCELLANEOUS\nstock market and sentiment results  we talked about unwinding the carry trades here are the notes from the show you can go through but Marcel Munch many of you know from Germany he&#39;s had me on his podcast several times to talk about China and he&#39;s a China expert in his own right particularly with uh China e s he actually reposted an excerpt from a podcast I did in March that was eerily um predictive let&#39;s just put it that way it was it was really crazy to hear it uh I did on this exact subject about the carry trade in March that predicted the events that we&#39;ve now seen in the past week why I&#39;m going to replay this right now is because it also talks about what we were waiting for with the Yen and with the Chinese Yuan as an indicator for what would happen with Chinese equities in other words all the pieces are coming into the puzzle that should make Baba hum where we got earnings coming in we got the new buyers coming in but now the global macro things are actually benefiting to uh also offer support more important than the fed this week as it relates to central banks which is the Bank of Japan just handicapped a winning strategy what to know about the Yen carry trade if you&#39;re in finance you have to know about the carry trade so this is a great article from Barons that lays it out Simply uh what is it it it&#39;s very simple you borrow money in a country with very low interest rates and then invest in a country where you can get considerably higher returns Japan&#39;s Central Bank interest rate has been around zero since 2016 the US uh 10-year bond yield by contrast has been higher than at at least 2% for most of that time the pandemic was a lengthly exception this is the general idea borrow money at 0% interest carry it abroad to invest at 2% the difference is your profit it&#39;s a sure winner lending to governments is considered risk-free because there&#39;s virtually no chance they won&#39;t repay their debts they can always print more money take your cash to other places than the US and your profits could be even bigger for example Mexico&#39;s 10-year Government Bond is currently just shy of 10% who does it institutions what could go wrong uh while it seems like a sure thing and mostly has been there are still risk changes in interest rates and exchange rates can either reinforce or derail the strategy for example the boj&#39;s ultral loose policy has driven the yend to 30-year lows against the dollar which makes the carry trade even more profitable because you&#39;re borrowing in Yen at zero rates reinvesting in dollars uh and making the spread and then getting an appreciation in in the dollar relative to the Yen throughout that whole period but if the Yen starts to strengthen now it will cut into carry trades earnings Rising interest rates tend to strengthen currencies by making investments in those currencies more attractive the Yen sold off on\n\nbut the products that are going to really move the needle for are going to be the gpus which are actually just launching this quarter which is which so the game hasn&#39;t even started they&#39;re holding their own they&#39;re able to maintain their revenues basically flat year on-ear but they don&#39;t even have the products in the market wants right now which you could say well why don&#39;t they because of all the bad decisions that were made that Ginger is writing with the four nodes in 5 years which is now basically complete but the market is too impatient which creates the Mis appraisal uh that creates the opportunity for people like us so launching in Q3 Intel&#39;s gouty 3 will take accelerated performance to the next level at just 2third the cost of competitive offerings to put it in perspective we expect Intel gouty 3 to deliver roughly two times the performance per dollar so on both inference and training versus is nvidia&#39;s h100 Chip so half the cost twice the performance 40% more energy efficient that&#39;s going to be competitive partner product especially because what did that Nvidia people used to say well it doesn&#39;t matter by the time you have your gouty 3 we&#39;re going to have Blackwell well Blackwell got delayed due to engineering Pro problems so it&#39;s going to give Intel a 3-month window to get this chip out there where everyone&#39;s going to start to say wait a second half the cost twice twice as efficient more energy efficient which cuts my overhead and Intel is going to gain some share here um so like like I said very hard to compete when the desired product is still baking in the oven that changes in Q3 for Intel which is now second quarter Revenue down 1% uh stock drop 30% Q3 is expected to be down 8% also weaker for the industry then Q4 Intel guides back to the Topp of range plus 5% Revenue growth year on-ear um as much as Intel disappointed from what they are communicating it looks like a temporary impairment versus a p permanent impairment it will take longer but time will tell price is what you pay value is what you get no one knows if price will go lower or higher in the short term but I&#39;ll take my chances on a firm that is set with government backing and support to become the leading AI systems Foundry and the second largest Foundry in the world by 2030 leading AI systems Foundry and second largest Foundry in the world by 2030 that&#39;s Ginger uh from q1 of of 2024 and you can see their products we&#39;re not going to go into that right now ### HEADLINES_AND_NEWS\nokay so this is from market watch it says Intel&#39;s worst drop in decades may have been steeper if not for this Factor the US government cannot afford to let Intel struggle over the longterm one analyst says uh well maybe two analyst because I&#39;ve been saying that for the last few weeks investors may have a sense that the company will be safe in the end despite its challenges thanks to Intel standing as a domestic chip manufacturer at a time when governments are interested in propping up local players in the chip Market in other circumstances we believe we would now be having going concern conversations with clients Bernstein Stacy ragon wrote a note to his clients by the way that&#39;s what the stock is trading like now and that is not on the table quote to just like Cooper standard when it was trading at $5 and $4 and $3 when we were pounding the table to that end and perhaps the one positive subsidies and partner contributions when combined with spending cuts and dividend suspension looks set to add $40 billion of incremental cash to the company&#39;s balance sheet through the end of 2025 suggesting Intel will survive in some form to continue the fight and that&#39;s the whole key with turnarounds is Runway right the subsidy point is intriguing intriguing Intel stuck a struck a deal with the US government earlier this year that awarded the company 8.5 billion in direct funding as well as 11 billion in loans through the chips act that&#39;s government program that&#39;s meant to bolster the US position in chip manufacturing and one that shows officials are thinking more seriously about help how to help players compete in this vital industry moving on uh given the increas inre inly critical role that semiconductors play and the precariousness of geopolitics governments including the US are making domestic chip capabilities more of a priority Intel sits in an especially important spot for the us because the company manufactures the chips itself that&#39;s the thing Nvidia and and all these other companies that don&#39;t manufacture own chips they are going to be at the mercy of Intel and Taiwan semiconductor which are going to have a duopoly our country and government cannot afford to let Intel founder and really struggle long term ASO desk based Jordan Klein said in a note to clients but Intel stands out the US government has a vested interest in Intel being a real player in Foundry and winning at the Leading Edge Klein wrote Intel is too important of a long-term strategic asset this reminds you of what of Boeing okay that&#39;s why Boeing hasn&#39;t been taken out to the Woodshed because it&#39;s a duopoly that&#39;s what Intel is going to be with Taiwan semiconductor Taiwan has taking us chip business one factor that led to a sharp subsequent decline in chip stocks though Intel stocks escaped that session unscathed demonstrating how investors view the company as the one that could benefit if nationalism comes to play more of a role in the industry Intel&#39;s conundrum parallels to that of Boeing another domestic Titan besieged BY execution issues that have P that have pressured financials but while Boeing isn&#39;t a major financial institution like a too big to fail Banks the company operates as the domestic half of a du ol with Airbus and it occupies a key position in the defense and Aerospace markets Boeing is an iconic business and major employer and the US government likely has a vested interest in its success as well as Intel&#39;s Intel&#39;s plan is to grow first and to shrink Intel&#39;s plan to grow first to shrink with layoffs reorganization and suspension of its shareholder dividend yet the news from Intel&#39;s second quarter earnings report on Thursday wasn&#39;t all bad Pat gelsinger continued to reiterate the company&#39;s ambitious plans for five nodes in four years to enables its Foundry business for both internal and external customers to catch up to Taiwan semiconduction manufacturing is still on track and executing as planned that means the critical 18a process node will indeed power some of Intel&#39;s most important products over the next two years the ability for Intel to be a key competitor in The Foundry space Remains the primary focus of the company&#39;s leadership Intel has shipped more has shipped more more than 15 million of its first AIP PC chips codenamed meteor Lake and is confident will have 40 million unit Ship by the end of 2024 that&#39;s a huge milestone and dwarfs dwarfs what AMD or Qualcomm could hope to do in the same time frame so that&#39;s that let&#39;s cover here there&#39;s so much to cover you really if you are thinking about owning it or already own it you really need to read through these parts that I highlighted we&#39;ll be here for 5 hours cuz it took me 5 hours to do ### MISCELLANEOUS\nokay as it relates to fourth quarter with an expectation of healthier inventory positions exiting the quarter and continuation of Enterprise refresh cycle we should see Revenue growth at the high end of seasonal in the fourth quarter so this is a short-term blip until they get the new products uh and and uh a seasonal blip as it relates to the next quarter uh that you just have to kind of see through in the short term uh mobile ey Revenue so some of their non-controlling businesses weren&#39;t doing well mobile ey uh although they&#39;re it improved and they expected to get better they Altera was a train wreck that hurt them a little bit but on balance let just get to some of these start operating cash flow was 2.3 billion up approximately 3.5 billion sequentially on better working capital um gross capx of 5.7 billion was more than offset by 11.5 billion in Grants and partner contributions highlighted by Apollo&#39;s scip investment in our Ireland Factory operations resulting in adjusted free cash flow of $8.2 billion the key is Runway here uh revenues were down 1% sequentially oh we&#39;re down 1 point year-over-year but their revenues were actually up 1% sequentially Revenue was in line with the range we provided in May after receiving notice of an export license restriction which negatively impacted our business in China Intel products and Intel Foundry both delivered 4% year-over-year growth offset by headwinds in our more cyclical businesses so there&#39;s a lot of good stuff under the surface it&#39;s just most people shoot first ask\n\nquestions  on the margins I guess at least 10% EIT a margin without volume growth doing the math that would imply 270 million of eida exiting 2025 am I doing the math right Jeffrey Edwards says yes you&#39;re doing the math right I mean if they do 270 million of eida exiting 2025 remember going back to 2027 uh 2017 when they earned $7 a share they were doing about 400 million you know we&#39;re starting to knock on the door here as the quarters move and once the volume ramps up to 16 16 and a half with all of the cuts and the pricing

don&#39;t have too many this week cu the call is so early um but we&#39;re going to cover the ones we have we do have like 10 ultas at 12 times earnings this is from John five very cheap and buying back shares looking to expand International any thoughts on looking into this business yeah I I&#39;ve looked at it and looked at it and looked at it and I think this is going to be an error of omission where I just don&#39;t get involved because when all is said and done it&#39;s still a bricks and mortar retailer um but yeah I mean it&#39;s getting to that point where it&#39;s attractive you look at the free cash flow is kind of holding in there revenues are going up return on capital is strong margins are holding in so would I take a punt on it I think you&#39;re probably okay but you know at the most you know over the next three or four years you&#39;re probably barely looking at a double so when something&#39;s not like super easy and straightforward to me and they return over 3 four years is less than a double I just immediately take a pass but I&#39;ll take a look at a couple of these things let&#39;s take a look at cash flow so it&#39;s fine they&#39;re doing a billion dollars of cash flow let&#39;s take a look at their income statement revenues have been flattish but they&#39;re going up in the right direction balance sheets probably fine 520 million of cash is this possible they have no long-term debt with uh retail stores wow that&#39;s pretty amazing um turn on Capital I don&#39;t know you know this has been on the watch list for a while I think you just have to understand what&#39;s the growth profile moving forward John cuz there&#39;s others like Sally Beauty that are really in trouble um that haven&#39;t been doing well well so if you can

is they've been selling 10cent so I wouldn't mess with it if you want if you like 10cent just buy 10cent Jim Jones uh if you want to exposure to natural gas and coal what would you look at uh we own com stock resources Jerry Jones is our partner own 66% of the equity also owns the Dallas Cowboys and he thinks that com stock is more valuable than the Cowboys based on past interviews Mark and and based on how we think about the reserves we agree Mark mayelo thanks for everything learned more here than all the books podcast I've studied what are your thoughts on Walgreens stock is their debt and Lees too large can they manage to comeb back I think they're probably going to be the last man man standing but it's a garbage business and I don't I really don't want to do it at any price so I'm going to pass on that but I think you might you know I think we've covered that one a couple times um and I think it will probably work but you know this stuff with it's revenue's going up cash flows negative margins negative I mean this is one of those that are better for a trade than for owning like right Right Aid is bankrupt I think this might be the last man standing I just don't want to be in the space there's too many counter wins with the pharmacy benefit managers with Amazon with direct to Consumer I I just don't want to play there they used to make all their money selling cigarettes now now that's gone Christian Dy SIU air they're doop and LCC Air Asia groups s suck at hammered uh only company did not need to restructure The Debs last thing I want to buy is an airliner in Asia but let let me take a look um SIU if I want to buy a garbage Airline I'll buy one in America let's say SIU air I don't know can I get the regular ticker here C Ebu yeah massive negative free cash flow I I don't want to mess with this let me see about the debt okay 250 million of cash billion dollars of debt negative half a billion of free cash flow no this is a train wreck I I'd pass Christian at any price Jacob what do you think about Intel after the latest quarterly results I didn't realized they reported um let me look into that kidding actually we just covered it thank you for the great question um all right David Martin found you on Tik toks a few months back and have become an avid listener podcast thanks for helping us out us very sub one million accounts curious to hear your thoughts about adding to my positions I totally understand dollar cost averaging at lower prices but when how or and or would you add to a position once it starts to move up um never that's me I buy down not up I buy red days not green days uh if you need an actual stock we can use CPS as an example no I just buy CP PS when it's red and I have cash period that's very simple uh I never buy it when it's going up or or green uh and we got plenty so we're happy with our positioning we're happy with our basis and now we're just going to let John Edwards and team Jeff Edwards and John vanis uh work their magic continue to execute until the volume I mean they've basically got this thing running like such a well-oiled machine at such low volumes that they could be cash flow positive next year assuming no growth in volumes when volumes are going to grow when the average car on the road is 13.5 years and the average Millennial is 33 years old that's when they buy they buy the most cars and dishwashers with for those of you who have asked me about whirlpool and homes and baby stuff between 33 and 40 and this time will be no different and they're going to be the beneficiary so fact they can go cash flow positive in the next year assuming no volume growth when volume growth is going to come back uh rates are going to come lower inventories are going to go up uh oems are going to start to give incentives volumes are going to start to go through the roof margins for oems will go down but um that all we care about is volumes and they will be a key beneficiary so uh hope that answers your question we'll be back next week same time same place in the mean uh no actually we'll be back at our normal time normal place in the meantime make it a great one thanks for tuning in have a great week a [Music] a [Music] [Music]\n\nbut when how or and or would you add to a position once it starts to move up um never that&#39;s me I buy down not up I buy red days not green days uh if you

      "finally  take the Chinese Yuan off the mat and appreciate the Yuan which is the key that we&#39;ve been looking at as it related to our exposure in China expressed in a position in Alibaba and what we&#39;ve been talking about is as the fed eases and the dollar weakend Emerging Markets will get bid and China will be a benefici that is true but what I laid out here which is even more important is the yuan&#39;s relationship to the US dollar and as we can see almost perfectly as the Yuan rallied from 2000 relative to the US dollar the Yuan strengthened uh from 2016 to 2018 Alibaba had a parabolic move the Yuan strength is in Black the Alibaba is in red and you can see as the Yuan went up Alibaba went parabolic the Yuan rolled over Alibaba crashed down and then uh the final rally as the Yuan started to recover you had that parabolic move into 2021 with Ali Baba Yuan rolled over Alibaba and the rest of Chinese and kweb stocks crashed it&#39;s been doing this double bottom and this could have been the sea change we have all been waiting for ladies and gentlemen that we get this double bottom in like we saw in 2019 and 2020 and a parabolic move up and we get the Yuan off the mat Yuan starts to appreciate because the boj&#39;s new policy stance and the fed&#39;s new policy stance uh Yuan being appreciative stance of tightening rates fed being depreciative stance of loosening rates strengthening the Yuan which will cause the flows into China into Chinese equities to explode yet again no one can see that right now until it happens and then this will be the most hated rally all the way up of all time no one will believe it until it hits 200 then they will hate it and then they will join it and that&#39;s what will happen and today was the warning shot fired all around the world following the meeting when the FED confirmed they were going to be doish and they have no choice Bank of Japan has been the liquidity back stop for Global central banks while they got inflation under control for the last two years and now Japan is saying we&#39;ve got inflation coming we want to normalize our policy it&#39;s time for you to back stop us we are going to normalize policy and that is the global coordinated Central Bank policy that has worked so well so now it&#39;s flip-flopping from strong dollar weak Yen uh and weak foreign currencies to now weaker dollar weaker Euro stronger Yen uh Stronger Yen stronger Yuan and that will be great for Chinese equities and I think the misnomer here for everyone chasing Japanese equities is the stronger Japanese Yen despite all the constructive developments as it relates to corporate governance and uh spins and shareholder friendly policies moving in the right direction I do think the stronger Yen will be a headwind the weekend has been H Tailwind for the recent rally in Japanese stocks it will now become a headwind and all the Chinese flows that have come out of China and into Japan are now going to go back home as price starts to change opinion opinion follows Trend and this move here today albeit it doesn&#39;t mean that it&#39;s going to do it tomorrow but it&#39;s the beginning of this regime change that is significantly important for so many of the things that we&#39;re doing and for the global change uh around the world this will also support small caps this will also support dividend payers code value stocks like Stanley Black and&amp; Decker genac 3M all these Industrials that have been waiting to take off natural gas companies like Comstock resources etc etc etc so very excited here the 10year did not know what to do today um it started by collapsing and then it started to get bit up I think what you&#39;re going to see over the next few weeks is while the dollar starts to re weaken the Yen starts to get bid the Yuan starts to strengthen the 10-year bonds are going to slowly climb and yields are going to slowly compress now just as I always said with the FED because most of the time the the move is bad after Powell speaks and I always say don&#39;t get faked out the first move is often the wrong move it may in fact be the case that that could be true this time as well could we be Off to the Races for 19 out of 21 weeks up in US equities it could be that would be great I mean it was very interesting today today I think overall the portfolio is up 2.2% and the general indices were up between 90 basis points and and a buck so you know our Hedges were moving against us but the overall portfolio was outperforming uh the deterioration of the hedges as we&#39;re going to discuss in the article of the week um and it was a great day 2.2% on any day is great um uh it was it was interesting to see and maybe we&#39;ll get even further follow through and this will continue for another four weeks who knows I would be alert uh that that&#39;s all I was going to say as a matter of fact I was going to lean into the hedges today but we already have full 2% of equity Capital that is sufficient to create an extra uh um 10% of free Capital if we&#39;re right on the four to six% pullback over the next couple of months but [Music] um uh you know I wouldn&#39;t number one I wouldn&#39;t be pessimistic because a lot of things are lining up right and we&#39;re going to go through a list of them and number two I wouldn&#39;t be chasing if I wasn&#39;t already fully invested uh either especially in the shiny objects that have already run um because well you might get a few days follow through I would just keep an open mind sometimes that first move is a fake out and let&#39;s see how how it plays out uh in the next few days I think the real underlying move should be a you know as we look out for to to 12 weeks Yen starts to strengthen bonds start to get bid dollar starts to weaken uh Emerging Markets get bid us maybe flattish to down uh could be flat sideways which we discussed you know three four weeks ago we said probably the move that screws the most people is the the indices actually just grind sideways so they take out all the put premium they take out all the call Premium um and and and I&#39;d be open-minded to that because that implies now",

      "with Chinese equities in other words all the pieces are coming into the puzzle that should make Baba hum where we got earnings coming in we got the new buyers coming in but now the global macro things are actually benefiting to uh also offer support more important than the fed this week as it relates to central banks which is the Bank of Japan just handicapped a winning strategy what to know about the Yen carry trade if you&#39;re in finance you have to know about the carry trade so this is a great article from Barons that lays it out Simply uh what is it it it&#39;s very simple you borrow money in a country with very low interest rates and then invest in a country where you can get considerably higher returns Japan&#39;s Central Bank interest rate has been around zero since 2016 the US uh 10-year bond yield by contrast has been higher than at at least 2% for most of that time the pandemic was a lengthly exception this is the general idea borrow money at 0% interest carry it abroad to invest at 2% the difference is your profit it&#39;s a sure winner lending to governments is considered risk-free because there&#39;s virtually no chance they won&#39;t repay their debts they can always print more money take your cash to other places than the US and your profits could be even bigger for example Mexico&#39;s 10-year Government Bond is currently just shy of 10% who does it institutions what could go wrong uh while it seems like a sure thing and mostly has been there are still risk changes in interest rates and exchange rates can either reinforce or derail the strategy for example the boj&#39;s ultral loose policy has driven the yend to 30-year lows against the dollar which makes the carry trade even more profitable because you&#39;re borrowing in Yen at zero rates reinvesting in dollars uh and making the spread and then getting an appreciation in in the dollar relative to the Yen throughout that whole period but if the Yen starts to strengthen now it will cut into carry trades earnings Rising interest rates tend to strengthen currencies by making investments in those currencies more attractive the Yen sold off on",

      "financial times this is an article from Barons saying that uh talking about Intel we&#39;re going to cover a lot of Intel today and you know it says from the start G singer said his goal was to achieve leadership and Chip manufacturing by 2025 sure enough Intel&#39;s new processors called Panther Lake are scheduled for release in the second half of 2025 when I asked the senior Intel executive when Intel would finally  be able to make a processor that&#39;s better at performance and power efficiency versus amd&#39;s offering offerings the person pointed to the new Panther Lake chip there&#39;s a glimmer of hope for Intel on the horizon uh that said I&#39;m not suggesting it&#39;s time to buy the stock until it&#39;s had too many missteps and false starts PR need to wait but basically the case that this author is making take him is that a lot of these bad decisions were made before Ginger Ginger took the helm at 2021 many of Intel&#39;s problems stem from decisions made by his predecessor take several years to hire the right Talent then develop then design then make new Chips we&#39;re going to go through it line by line in the article of the week so just hang tight China&#39;s Yuan climbs to seven-month high on stronger Yen unwinding of global carry trade this is what we&#39;ve been waiting for ladies and gentlemen we&#39;ve done the overlays over and over again uh for months about the Yuan needing to appreciate dollar depreciate and uh Chinese yield on government debt start to go up we&#39;re going to we&#39;re going to talk about that in just a moment Global car trade y gains okay we covered that China&#39;s Services activity expands we covered that most popular trades are unraveling this I covered with Charles so what were the four most crowded trades last month and for many months before a long Magnificent Seven that&#39;s unwinding with the carry trade on wand second most crowded trade was short Yen had the biggest rally in the yen in the last two weeks that we&#39;ve ever probably seen in history three was short small caps that started to unwind last month it took a little hiccup this uh last week and a half that&#39;s going to re accelerate based on fundamentals and the fourth most crowded trade was short China equities and what did better than any other asset class in the last week China equities so uh that is what we&#39;ve been waiting for Global hedge funds actually added Chinese domestic stocks in July says Goldman Sachs this is daily saying a policy adjustment is still coming soon or rather than later even though she&#39;s not worried about anything at all she&#39;s still going to get that policy adjustment happening sooner rather than later in video which we had talked about before it crashed when everyone was clamoring all over each other to get stock after they did the split and sucked in all the new buyers uh Jensen Wong sold 323 million a stock in July before the decline he dumped it all on the retail investors heads so beware when that happens again I think people got wise to it because super micro or some one of those companies reported after the bell and they announced a split and the stock was down 9% uh afterm Market biggest margin debt on wine since 1999 spurred Taiwan Taiwan stock route that&#39;s why we don&#39;t use much leverage Chinese brokerages talk up local stocks after global meltdown Goldman says buying the S&P after 5% drop is usually profitable we showed you the data behind that Mar here&#39;s from Nick timos from yesterday Market sell-offs upends Fed rate cut calculus a further slow down in the labor market could lead to a larger Half Point rate cut next month so the FED Whisperer is starting to drop hints about 50 basis point Cuts as a trial balloon for the feds setting the stage that&#39;s pretty interesting China defensive SE sectors win favor as Asian stocks stage rebound and now onto our article of the week like a phoenix From the Ashes",

      "moving along  to Intel on Thursday August 2nd uh Intel had reported earnings for Q2 revenues dropped 1% year on year and the stock dropped 30% which is something to keep in mind guys to keep things in perspective revenues were down 1% year on-ear the stock dropped 30% year onye so what does Warren Buffett talk about great investment opportunities come around when excellent companies are surrounded by unusual circumstances that caused the stock to be misappreciation in 11 years since 2013 the company also announced the suspension of the dividend starting in Q4 and a layoff of more than 15% of the workforce I spoke with CEO Pat galinger his only broadcast interview right after the analyst call last night starting with the layoff you know it&#39;s hard this is the Intel family so I feel this very deeply at the same time making the steps to have an efficient Intel for the future that has both process and product leadership but also Financial sustainability in the model you know we&#39;re committed to this journey you know this is the most substantial you know uh restructuring of Intel since the I&#39;ll say the memory microprocessor transition four decades ago we have laid out on an audacious journey of rebuilding this company and we&#39;re going to get that done and today&#39;s uh announcement is accelerating the financial piece of that even as we build on the product and process capab\nabilities that we&#39;ve put in place I asked Ginger about the reasoning Behind These Cuts aside from the immediate need to preserve cash we&#39;re making these cuts to build a more efficient Intel and what happened at the beginning of the year was We disclosed this new financial model the new operating model of Intel a worldclass fabulous company and a world-class Foundry Company we began a clean sheet analysis of the two pieces of the business and we said what does worldclass look like for each of those uh businesses because we were operating in the old model for five decades and that clean sheet exercise led us to say these are the changes that we need to be an efficient Nimble company for the future that&#39;s what&#39;s driving the restructuring that you&#39;ve heard us announced today the financial performance accelerated that a bit but the work was already launched and underway from the start of the year and now we want to get them done quickly so that we have this new operational model in place and fully supported by a more efficient organization so we expect the majority of these will be finished uh this year so that we&#39;re able to have a more efficient effective Intel Foundry Intel products and an overall Intel delivering product and process leadership with financial performance as well I also asked G singer why an investor seeing the stock plummet today and seeing the dividend suspension would put money in now well we believe that those foundational Investments are realizing beginning now right these new products we&#39;re seeing them come to life you know for instance the aipc is a great example of that we have the leadership product today with core Ultra we&#39;re about to announce the next generation of that at the EA show uh coming up next month you know lunar Lake our second generation core Ultra you know unquestioned leadership and performance and AI capabilities dramatic improvements and power you know our next Generation server products are shipping this quarter so I&#39;ll say all of this hard work that we&#39;ve done starts to materialize now and I think we&#39;ve reset the financial expectations now and we&#39;ve taken the steps that you know the markets should look at and say wow they are really getting their house in order for a efficient Intel building on the leadership Intel work of the last three years now is the opportunity to start benefiting from those and we believe that the guidance that we&#39;ve given is now you know well placed in the market the steps were taking you know well respected and with the products and the technology we&#39;re now well positioned to begin a very solid cycle you know for the Intel of the future this has been heavy lifting and we&#39;re now confident that building on that we can go forward effectively in the market for the future uh it was a tough quarter a few back and the Hope was that there was a trajectory after that point that would be more predictable we&#39;re here now um and it sounds like you&#39;re saying that again at what point do we know that those kinds of surprises and the needs for realignment are out of the way or is this just such a a rocky period uh for Intel and the the changes that are needed in the industry that you can&#39;t say clearly you know this has been a challenging rebuild this has been an audacious rebuilding of Intel one that I&#39;m proud of the work that we&#39;ve done you know rebuilding a company like this is heavy work we always said it was going to be a five plus year Journey here we are three years in we&#39;ve accomplished the most significant process technology you know cycle people didn&#39;t think it was possible now the end is clearly in sight as we&#39;ve released the pdk the products have come to life These are significant Milestones ones that people thought were impossible three years ago they&#39;re now done John you know and building on that these new products that we&#39;re bringing these are competitive products you know we&#39;re no longer in a position that we&#39;re losing market share because we have inadequate products and our AI products aipc our gouty 3 that we&#39;re beginning to ship this quarter you know all of these things are now coming together so yes I understand some of those concerns but I&#39;d also say look at what we&#39;ve gotten done this is incredible what we&#39;ve gotten done and we&#39;re now combining that with the steps to build a more efficient Intel this is the most significant rebuilding of Intel in four plus decades I&#39;m proud of the work we&#39;ve gotten done and we&#39;re committed to finish the job and we are well on our way to do exactly that a lot riding on gudy 3 as that launches in Rams and aipc we&#39;ll see where Intel goes from here and we&#39;re back so I put out a note after earnings which I usually don&#39;t do by the way way on Twitter X and I said I quoted him launching in Q3 you know
