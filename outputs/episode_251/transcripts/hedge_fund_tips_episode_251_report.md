**Executive Summary**
> Tom Hayes is extremely bullish on Chinese equities, particularly Alibaba, due to the unwinding of the Yen carry trade and the anticipated strengthening of the Yuan. He also highlights opportunities in Intel, Cooper Standard, and VF Corp, emphasizing balance sheet improvements and turnaround potential. He advocates for dividend payers and cyclicals in the current market environment, while remaining cautious about chasing overextended assets.

**Tom's Current Market Conviction: Constructive for the next six to seven weeks, but with potential for aftershocks and sideways movement. → 7/10** 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥☆☆☆

- Global liquidity coming to bear with central bank cuts.
- Small cap earnings expected to grow dramatically faster than large cap.
- Potential for a credit unwind and fund liquidations creating opportunities.

## Macro Thesis & Key Data Points
The unwinding of the Yen carry trade is a significant catalyst for a shift in global capital flows, benefiting Chinese equities and emerging markets. A weaker dollar, stronger Yuan, and lower rates will create a favorable environment for dividend payers, cyclicals, and value stocks. While US equities may experience sideways movement, opportunities exist in specific sectors and turnaround stories.

|-----------|-------|----------------------|
| Global Central Bank Cuts | 35 cuts in the last 3 months | Perfect environment to be a buyer, not a seller of equities. |
| Nikkei Performance | Down 25% | Unwind of the Japanese carry trade, creating liquidity dislocation. |
| China's Yuan | Climbing to a seven-month high | Signaling a shift in capital flows back into China and a positive environment for Chinese equities. |
| Earnings Growth | 11.5% earnings growth | That's not really what you see during recessions ladies and gentlemen Som rule or not which is why we R remain constructive |
