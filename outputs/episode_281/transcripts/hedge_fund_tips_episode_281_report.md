# Hedge Fund Tips with Tom Hayes – Episode Not Applicable
### March 8, 2024

**Executive Summary**
> Tom Hayes is extremely bullish on international stocks, particularly Chinese tech (specifically Alibaba), small caps, and select healthcare and home-building related stocks. He believes the market is in a rotation out of the overvalued Mag 7 and into these undervalued areas. He sees a technical bounce coming for Mag 7 but expects range-bound trading while other sectors outperform. He emphasizes the importance of focusing on Japanese and European bond yields and sees potential for a significant rally through the summer, especially if the Fed cuts rates sooner than expected.

**Tom's Current Market Conviction: Bullish → 9/10** 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥☆

- International stocks are dramatically outperforming.
- Small caps are poised for a rippy face off rally.
- The 10-year yield is rolling over, favoring growth outside of the crowded Mag 7.
- Earnings growth is accelerating outside of the Mag 7.
- The Fed is likely to cut rates sooner than expected.

## Macro Thesis & Key Data Points
The market is undergoing a rotation from overvalued, crowded trades (Mag 7) to undervalued sectors like international stocks, small caps, and select value plays. This rotation is driven by decelerating earnings growth in the Mag 7, a weakening US dollar, compressing bond yields, and the potential for Fed rate cuts. Trump 2.0 will bring volatility but ultimately resolve to the upside.

| Indicator | Value | Tom's Interpretation |
|-----------|-------|----------------------|
| Japanese Government Bond (JGB) Yields | Rising | Rising JGB yields are unwinding the carry trade that supported the Mag 7, putting pressure on those stocks and freeing up capital to flow into undervalued markets. |
| US 10-Year Treasury Yield | Rolling Over | The 10-year yield is rolling over, signaling potential for lower mortgage rates and increased growth in sectors like homebuilding and autos. |
| US GDP Now (Q1) | Negative -2.4% | While potentially inaccurate, this negative GDP print, if realized, could force the Fed to cut rates sooner than expected, boosting risk assets. |
| Mag 7 Earnings Growth | Decelerating from 33% to 16% | Decelerating earnings growth in the Mag 7 makes their high multiples unsustainable, driving a rotation to sectors with accelerating growth and lower valuations. |
| S&P 600 Earnings Growth | Accelerating to 21% | Small caps are poised to outperform due to their accelerating earnings growth and low valuations. |

## Risks & Contrarian Flags
- ⚠️ Tariff fears are overblown and will likely be resolved.
- ⚠️ Recency bias is blinding investors to the potential of international stocks and small caps.
- ⚠️ The market is underestimating the impact of passive deregulation under Trump 2.0.
- ⚠️ The consensus is too bearish on the economy and the potential for earnings growth outside of the Mag 7.

## Technical Takeaways
The Mag 7 are due for a technical bounce but will likely trade in a range while other sectors outperform. The 10-year yield is rolling over, signaling lower rates and potential for growth in sectors like homebuilding and autos. Several indicators point to a technical bounce in the coming weeks.
