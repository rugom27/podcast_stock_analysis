I&#39;m looking at a bunch of technical indicators which I don&#39;t spend a lot of time on you know I&#39;m a fundamental analyst we are close to washed out across the board so we are going to be in the market shopping today and this afternoon and maybe tomorrow as well but most likely today we will be putting on materially sized positions all right cleancut decision from Tom Hayes thanks for joining us Tom we appreciate you jumping in here thanks very much indeed for having me still sure thank coming up and we&#39;re back and then I had the pleasure to join my friend Lou bassan you know him from vne and Co you know him from uh mornings with Maria you know him from Cavuto we used to do uh the same show and you know from the big money show on Fox Business he is doing his own live

and uh he does a lot of creative companies like disruptive technology and all kinds of small cap stuff he had a CEO from an electronic devices small electronic devices company on be in the a block before my segment\n\n### MEDIA_APPEARANCE_RECAP\nwe are going to be in the market shopping today and this afternoon and maybe tomorrow as well but most likely today we will be putting on materially sized positions all right cleancut decision from Tom Hayes thanks for joining us Tom we appreciate you jumping in here thanks very much indeed for having me still sure thank coming up and we&#39;re back and then I had the pleasure to join my friend Lou bassan\n\n### HEADLINES_AND_NEWS\nwe&#39;re still cooking with gas we just need to be a little bit more selective uh I think you know if you look at the S&P is actually down now half a percent year to date but if you start to look at International and some of the other stocks which you referenced in the a block uh tremendous outperformance you know Europe up 15% year to date yeah my Italian Breen are up 19% alone so we got to give a shout out to those Italians and Jersey Boys like yourself that&#39;s right that&#39;s right so where do you like in in Europe I mean are you looking at particular opportunities I mean I know you run a more concentrated portfolio wildly successful too by the way folks this is not something Tom would ever say out loud I have no giving him credit he was right about Disney I was wrong he&#39;s probably going to be right about other big stocks but where are you finding value now in Europe yeah in Europe we&#39;re a bit more selective on the big Arbitrage has been in the most unpopular region in the world which is China and I&#39;m going to give you a stat right now Lou that&#39;s going to blow your mind if you look at the tremendous 10 which is the Chinese internet equivalent of the US mag 7 uh the spread of outperformance year to date is 45% in China internet so that&#39;s companies like Alibaba what are what are some of the names that that run down that list yeah so alibaba&#39;s up 64% year to date uh if you if you look at my friend brandan ahern&#39;s uh kweb ETF China ETF up 25% year to date and if you look at the Magnificent 7 in the US down 7.7% year to dat you can look at the uh ETF Ms will give you the year-to-date performance on the basket so what we&#39;re seeing Lou is we&#39;re seeing a weakening of the US dollar we&#39;re seeing the 10year yield uh bond yields come down this all favors International I really love that chart you put out earlier in your show about showing that while US Stock exceptionalism has been the norm for the last 10 13 14 15 years it actually moves in regular Cycles every 10 to 15 years and in the second term of Reagan for instance uh International stocks dramatically outperform the US after a long period of us outperformance so uh we can get caught up in recency bias and say only US Stocks because that&#39;s what&#39;s worked the last 10 years but if we zoom out which is a core of our framework we&#39;ll see that these are regular cycles and and uh you know we&#39;ve been talking for the last few months lighting up on mag 7 and start to get some International exposure and that that&#39;s uh that&#39;s now think it&#39;s a great Point as you said it there I want to make sure people caught the newest start to get some International exposure not bail out of all your us exposure but opportunistically I mean this is what we talk about as a tactical allocation right like you have your your mix and then as opportunities present I mean as you said I mean even the Apple the Beloved apple of my eye is trading at 32 times forward earnings right now that&#39;s rich historically I mean you look at alphabet it&#39;s it&#39;s probably the most affordable at 19 but where&#39;s what valuations are you seeing in China I mean is it you know are we talking 10 to 12 times 14 times earnings like what listen you still can&#39;t give them away this is early days I mean yeah I look and by the way I&#39;m not sitting here to take any Victory lap because uh you know as well as anyone else I&#39;ve been in Baba you know this has been a position that we&#39;ve been building for two years uh and not on purpose okay I mean you know we started buying in the hundreds and when it got honey sorry I bought some more alib Baba yeah yeah when it got down to 60 we backed up the truck so yes we have a basis of 83 across all accounts uh and we&#39;re very excited about that but this is early days I mean basically price is what you pay value is what you get they&#39;re still trading at 12 13 times forward earnings and growth is reaccelerating you know you talk about Apple being expensive uh at 30 times relative to its historic multiple had been 14 times what what what is I say concerning but what is different is the earnings growth is low double digits like 12% earnings growth and paying 33 if it was growing at 20% Then 33 would be very realistic so I think these things are taking a taking a little breather for sure so great overview I mean great specifics on Baba I know everyone is appreciating that I wanted you said something back up the truck I believe this I want to see if you agree because I know we agree at least strategically on this small caps is it a backup up the truck moment yet in small Caps or is it yeah yes unequivocally yes and and by the way you know and this feeds into the mag S as well so why are we why why have we been saying for months trim back the mag seven get some International exposure you nailed it in your a block it all comes down to earnings so mag s earnings growth is decelerating was 33% last year going to be 16% or less this year lot of capex spending unknown return on investment Capital 24 right like you can see that even in the cloud services growth like quarter over quarter for All The Bigs like you know they&#39;re making continual Investments but the growth rate t\n\n### FEATURED_COMPANY_DEEP_DIVES\nan't give them away this is early days I mean yeah I look and by the way I'm not sitting here to take any Victory lap because uh you know as well as anyone else I've been in Baba you know this has been a position that we've been building for two years uh and not on purpose okay I mean you know we started buying in the hundreds and when it got honey sorry I bought some more alib Baba yeah yeah when it got down to 60 we backed up the truck so yes we have a basis of 83 across all accounts uh and we're very excited about that but this is early days I mean

capex spending unknown return on investment Capital 24 right like you can see that even in the cloud services growth like quarter over quarter for All The Bigs like you know they're making continual Investments but the growth rate t\n\n### MISCELLANEOUS\nwhat&#39;s happening with what I love you you I&#39;ve stolen it from you I hope you don&#39;t mind it&#39;s flattery right I mean I&#39;m I&#39;m copying you the UNM magnificent 493 what&#39;s going on with them you know I thought a lot more people would steal that phrase I say it every single week uh you know we do a lot of the same shows together H it hasn&#39;t caught on so so maybe now that you say it you know you&#39;re more handsome people will listen uh that would incredible got a chuckle from everyone here in the studio so they obviously don&#39;t believe that but what yeah what&#39;s the growth rates looking for them I mean is it re accelerating is it stable exactly so it was basically negative for a couple quarters then it then it got low single digits uh towards the end of last year it&#39;s going to accelerate up to low double digits in coming quarters towards the end of the year early next year while the mag 7 is decelerating so there&#39;s huge opportunities under the surface and small caps depending which index you look at Lou uh Russell 2000 because they&#39;re coming off such a low base 40% plus earnings growth uh small caps uh S&P 600 21% earnings growth you can&#39;t give these away they&#39;re in the gutter right now because of the Tariff noise but uh that that&#39;s going to get resolved welcome to Trump 2.0 same as Trump 1.0 daily volatility and we go up 100% I was on vanney on Monday and they asked you know what do you think about tariffs I&#39;m like look they&#39;re going to go into effect tomorrow on Tuesday and I wouldn&#39;t be surprised by Friday if they&#39;re not in effect and we it took till Wednesday until they started repealing or revising some so I think you&#39;re you&#39;re absolutely right great opportunities um I want to go before we we kind of close out\n\nwhat&#39;s your thoughts on the fed&#39;s next move I think Jerome Powell is the Rodney danger field of Finance he gets absolutely no respect and rightfully so CU he&#39;s screwed the pooch on the front side of predicting inflation but what do you think his next move is in light of all the market conditions well it&#39;s interesting looking at today the odds of a June cut just went up to 85% uh you know we talk about all these things that none of which were on people&#39;s Bingo cards at the turn of the year whether it&#39;s International outperformance whether it&#39;s dollar weakening whether it&#39;s yields compressing or whether it&#39;s the FED now cutting which you know just a few weeks ago everyone saying no Cuts in 2025 we&#39;re g to get two cuts at least one to two c so you think two I I&#39;ve been on the record saying it&#39;s maybe one maybe none uh that was a couple weeks ago for me the big sticking points were the categories of inflation that were were stubbornly high so food shelter and energy those are not things you can quickly correct so my thesis has been that look we&#39;re going to get stubbornly higher inflation stuck in the three and a half range and because of that that you know Pal&#39;s going to have to wait but you think possibly two cuts which at the end of the way that fed put&#39;s going to be worth while for stock investors so it&#39;s a net positive for us exactly the more you know look last thing I just want to say keep an eye on the 10year jgb yields this is the most important chart that no one else is paying attention to uh those are climbing because the bank of Japan has to hike to quell inflation which is growing after 10 you know 20 years of printing money crazy right like never ever do we think we would be in the situation in Japan with them coming off zero if you you look at the last Peak was late July before you had that mag seven scare in early August yeah a lot of hot money has come into the mag7 which is a very crowded trade it&#39;s getting it&#39;s starting to uncrowded to quell inflation the more hot money is going to come out of Mag s so that&#39;s why the opportunities in UNM mag 493 small caps International Etc does doesn&#39;t mean you have to get out of these great businesses it just means uh more moderation and I think that&#39;s the going to be a theme in opportunity in 2025 for sure\n### MEDIA_APPEARANCE_RECAP\nand I want to reemphasize something that is critically important that I covered with Lou and that is uh the most important chart that no one is paying attention to uh and I posted this on Twitter so you can see it here uh this is the uh Japanese 10-year bond yield at 152 and I found it comical all day uh every single major commentator was blaming Tech being down 3% on tariffs which has nothing to do with it whatsoever and what what we really have happening and you&#39;re seeing it as the 10-year yield has been going down one thing that people haven&#39;t been paying attention to is European bond yields blowing out and more importantly the Japanese 10-year yield this is the key to the markets continues to go up and what that means is the carry trade is unwinding as the boj has to now raise rates to fight off inflation from 20 continuous years of printing money um uh the free money is drying up and a lot of that hot free money that they were able to borrow in Yen for free and buy Mag 7 the most crowded trade in the world is now evaporating as capital has a cost it&#39;s coming out of the overvalued pockets of the market and finding undervalued pockets of the market like China uh you know whether it&#39;s Baba up 65% year-to date whether it&#39;s kweb up uh 25% Europe up 15% Etc um uh that Trend will continue that said it would not Shock me to see a bounce in the mag 7 what we said for 2025 was that mag 7 would underperform index us index returns would be subdued because mag 7 is such an incredibly High weight uh and for you know a huge opportunity under the surface in UNM magnificent 493 but much more so in international and also believe uh on the Tailwind is going to be small cap you got to pay attention to that but amazing mag s down 7.7% uh and um so keep an eye as long as that those jgb yields keep going up you&#39;re going to see continued pressure on mag 7 I think we&#39;re due for a technical bounce here on mag s they could even go as high as the top of their recent range I wouldn&#39;t bet on it but it wouldn&#39;t surprise me um uh and then we&#39;re going to get through that period of seasonality that we&#39;ve discussed in many uh of the last podcast where February and the first two weeks of March in a postelection year is very weak and then you get a monstrous uh uh uh kind of rally in late March all the way through May June uh and I that would not surprise me whatsoever earnings growth coming in at 18.2% this quarter keeping Ane on GDP down uh GDP now is estimated to come in at negative -2.4 the other thing that few people are paying attention to is now uh uh fed fund Futures 85% chance of a cut in June which is why I was uh leaning with L to one to two cuts um and uh 10year yield and and US dollar continues to fall which favors International then I had the pleasure to join uh Kai Hoffman on sore financially for his podcast uh a few days back and we&#39;re going to listen in here every single dip in Alibaba we bought because it was the cheapest amount of value for the highest earnings growth and upside opportunity and uh when it turns it turns all at once and you know yeah 60% in a few weeks but it&#39;s early days for the China trade for years uh politicians have been substantiating their existence by creating more and more regulation putting more and more Governors against growth uh and um and Trump is throwing that playbook [Music] out hello and welcome to sore financially a channel where we discuss the macro to understand the micro my name is Kai Hoffman I&#39;m the Ed Jr mining guy over on X and of course I&#39;m your host of this Channel and I&#39;m looking forward to welcoming a First Time guest to the program it&#39;s Tom Hayes he&#39;s the chairman of great Hill capital and I&#39;m really looking forward to discussing with him like the General Market Outlook and the state of the economy uh I know he&#39;s strong on the AI side and he&#39;s brought us or he&#39;s bringing us some ideas on where to invest over 2025 what is he looking at and what are some of the ideas that he&#39;s following really looking forward to this discussion um before I switch over to my guest please be reminded to hit that like And subscribe button helps us out tremendously we much appreciate it and thank you for it so Tom it is great to have you on the program it&#39;s good to see you thank you so much for joining us thanks for having me Kai glad to be here yeah really looking forward to this a bit of a different perspective on what we usually talk about so we&#39;re we&#39;re really going to keep it mainstream almost like it&#39;s called mainstream because we were just chatting and you said oh you&#39;re gold Focus Channel I was like yeah but we&#39;re trying to widen the audience a little bit and just cover topics that a I&#39;m maybe personally not as strong in but also interested is just the general markets and you touched on a couple topics Emerging Markets small cap indices like really looking forward to learning more about that Tom um but before we get to that we we really got to start at a high level I&#39;m going to ask you since you&#39;re a First Time guest on the program like what&#39;s your current assessment of the economy and the financial markets I think on balance the economy is strong earnings are very strong we just got through earning season for Q4 the the bulk of it is done uh 16.9% earnings growth which is phenomenal uh that&#39;s the good news the bad news is guidance has been a little weaker than expected and S&amp;P earnings have come down expectations for this year from you know 275 for the S&amp;P down to like below 270 some shops are at 268 uh but it&#39;s not terribly concerning because this is the part of the year that I like to refer to as sandbagger season meaning uh seasonally uh CEOs tend to take down guidance in the first quarter to set expectations low so they can beat for the subsequent three quarters and I think that that will be no different this year it&#39;s where we are we&#39;re in the normal late February volatility chop uh that we see not only most years as February is the second worst month of the year but we see in a pronounced way postelection years on average since 1950 the S&amp;P is down 1.3% in February so here we are uh you know a handful of more days and then we&#39;ll probably start to find a bid on some some of the stocks that have been hammered oh absolutely no it&#39;s a you know seasonality is a big factor we we can get to that but uh I I got a burning question here like 16.9% earnings like growth where does it come from yeah it&#39;s it&#39;s been pretty broad you know the the whole theme for 2025 that we&#39;ve been talking about for you know a number of months on our our podcast and our public appearances has been the mag mag Magnificent Seven earnings that drove the bus in 2024 uh is De decelerating dramatically in 2025 so you had magnificent s grow earnings in 2024 at about 33% and what outperformed in 2024 magnificent 7 it&#39;s not a mystery uh the problem is and the dichotomy in the market is this year earning growth for the mag 7 are going to decelerate from 33% down to now it&#39;s about 16% almost half and the real problem is the multiples have not compressed commensurate with the D celeration in earnings growth so multiples have stayed up they&#39;re starting to come in a little bit but you know if you look at the rest of the market their earnings growth is going to accelerate from you know uh 3 3 4% last year to you know 13 14 15% and the multiple is a lot lower maybe 16 17 times 18 times versus the MA 7 at 33 times so I think people are figuring this out and they&#39;re reallocating which is why the mag 7 is down over one and a half% year to date while uh the S&amp;P is up to and change uh and some of the laggards from last year like materials and healthc Care are up you know five six seven percent year-to dat let&#39;s break that down even more so you&#39;re you&#39;re talking materials is growing there must be some consumer confidence and uh perfect topic for today cuz I wrote down consumer confidence missed expectations like yeah how does that fit together like when you see materials meanings like okay I can spend money on Home Improvement and other things I hope I&#39;m interpreting this right uh Tom but like where&#39;s that confidence coming from that we&#39;re not seeing in the numbers yeah so the consumer confidence is largely a function of a number of things uh number one is tariff fears people have uh been fed this narrative that tariffs will lead to sustainable inflation uh history doesn&#39;t bear that out it&#39;s a one time so let&#39;s say hypothetically all the tariffs that are promised go into place and it&#39;s 25% it&#39;s a one-time bump it&#39;s not 25% compounded at 3% per year uh and that&#39;s not that&#39;s not the way it works so what you find as you saw in 2018 with washing machines you get a short-term bump in price you look intermediate term a year later uh they&#39;re kind of kind of flat and then you know two years out they&#39;re actually down uh so people are are worried about the uncertainty of tariffs they&#39;re worried a little bit about inflation which by the way this time of year the January reports and the February reports tend to come in a little hotter seasonally so you know the last inflation reports were a little concerning for people but that is normal for this time of the year uh and I think a lot of this will be put behind us that said uh are people reallocating to where they can get more more earnings growth for a lower multiple you bet and we&#39;re seeing the move in particular into International stocks which are dramatically outperforming uh you know S&amp;P up two in change European equities up 10% that was on no one&#39;s Bingo cards coming into the year and emerging markets in China Emerging Markets up 7 and a half percent and China absolutely flying China Tech uh and that&#39;s our largest position and we&#39;ve been building that you know it&#39;s not like we just picked it five weeks and it went straight up I mean we&#39;ve been building that position for two years every single dip in Alibaba we bought because it was the cheapest amount of value for the highest earnings growth and upside opportunity and uh when it turns it turns all at once and you know yeah 60% in a few weeks but it&#39;s early days for the China trade very early days it&#39;s as as things seem to be calming down uh towards or like to the aggression towards China seems to be calming down a little bit I don&#39;t know that&#39;s again got feeling that&#39;s what I&#39;m sensing and you&#39;re sort of confirming it I I want to get to Alibaba L when we talk more tech stocks and like investment ideas um I want to stay on the fundamentals for now and I know we&#39;re going to get a lot of flak and people turning off when you said the economy is strong because my audience believes the economy is weak it&#39;s weakening um and there are definitely cracks in the system um visible and it seems like there&#39;s a bit of a uh discrepancy uh there was an article in the Wall Street Journal that I discussed with another guest the other day where like 10% of the spending or sorry the 10% are doing most of the spending while 90% the spending is going down dramatically um if I if I find it I&#39;ll bring it up in a second but I&#39;m curious like how where break that down like the economy is strong like what what do you base yeah so look I mean you had uh two recessions in two years in 2020 during covid you had two negative quarters of GDP growth or lack thereof and you in 2022 they never called it a recession but you had two quarters of NE consecutive quarters of negative GDP growth right now our GDP growth depending what trackers you look at but let&#39;s just say Atlanta fed GDP now is at 2.3% Goldman&#39;s a little more bearish at 1.9% you don&#39;t get a recession with positive GDP okay so whether it comes in at one and a half or two and a half it&#39;s really IMM material the key is it&#39;s growing despite the headwinds now to your point are people at the lower end of the economic spectrum uh struggling a little bit yes we we see all the data we&#39;re not blind to the default rate going up on credit cards a little bit on auto loans uh and and the like you&#39;ve had rates go up dramatically and you&#39;ve had people that became accustomed that weren&#39;t accustomed to being able to spend a lot of discretionary money that were you know force-fed checks from the government and got used to spending and eating out and doing all those things so when the money dried up they kept it going on their credit card so yeah there&#39;s going to be some pain at the low end but that you know that&#39;s that&#39;s been the bell curve since day one and uh not only did the top 10% uh percent make up you know 50% or more of the spending uh they pay a ton of the taxes so it&#39;s always been that way it&#39;s probably going to be that way but what I will say is that in Trump 1.0 uh the lower and middle class did a lot better than they did under Biden and they were really starting in terms of employment rates among minorities in terms of real wages increasing uh in terms of all that that group did the best and I think that&#39;s going to be the case in Trump 2.0 so if the cost of that is a little volatility in the US indices and for those of you who are in exclusively passive indexing in the S&amp;P 500 you&#39;re going to feel it because the mag 7 is you know 35% weight of that and their earnings are decelerating their capex is going up their margins are going to uh start to feel that if if they don&#39;t get the return which I don&#39;t think anyone expects in the next three to four quarters to see a return on the $300 billion doll of AI investment uh and um and you just have to adjust but on balance I think as we get through the fear of the tar tariffs and the reality or lack thereof of the tariffs uh I think you&#39;re going to find that uh doge is very efficient in cutting costs which is deflationary that is going to offset a lot of the fears around inflation and the 10-year yield is telling you exactly that&#39;s going to happen which is why you saw in the last few quarters couple of quarters uh that hedge funds were the most short the 10year treasury than they&#39;ve been since late 2018 and that was the period that preceded one of the biggest Bond rallies in the shortest period of time yields compressed I think we&#39;re going to see the exact same thing the smart Money commercials are short are long bonds uh very long Bonds longest since 2018 and that&#39;s why you&#39;re seeing the 10-year get bid yields are starting to compress the exact opposite of what everyone was calling for a few weeks ago when the 10e yield was at 480 and everyone said it was going to five and we were out publicly and said nope it&#39;s going to four I think we&#39;re going to four and we may not even stop at four we&#39;re going to see a three handle which is going to shock a lot of people and that is going to Spur a level of growth not in mag 7even but in things like Auto industry in things like homeb building which has gotten left for dead in things like homeb building suppliers uh tool producers like Stanley Black and&amp; Decker which is one of our our positions like JRA which has 75% of the home standby generator this is the kind of stuff that&#39;s not sexy today because everyone wants to chase what&#39;s up the shiny objects and they&#39;re getting their heads handed to them but it&#39;s going to be sexy 6 n months from now when everyone is getting excited about DeWalt construction tools mark my words uh that will be a funny day and maybe I&#39;ll be back to celebrate a little bit of that with you doesn&#39;t doesn&#39;t S you know it it reminds me an awful lot of when everyone was pounding the table that China was uninvestable and we were pounding the table to buy it you know backing up the truck in the 60s when Morgan Stanley was downgrading in the hole and maybe you saw it this week up 100% from there and uh now they&#39;re upgrading China stocks I mean you can&#39;t make this stuff up no clear direction to be quite honest bit flip-flopping in the wind\n### MISCELLANEOUS\nI just quickly want to share that chart with you that that I found and uh you know the US consumer is is really really hurting just looking at cumulative excess savings that&#39;s from the article I mentioned and I&#39;m not sure if you can see that Tom but uh top 10% of earners roughly savings 1.3 trillion the other 90% of earners only have $291 billion saved anymore we all know that the US consumer is not a really a big saver savings rate in the US is 3.8% but we&#39;re trending toward zero here you know and the question is like when do we hit the panic button when are we in like fullon Eco trouble mode um you know right now everything seems fine I do agree like the numbers are not lying yes there&#39;s a Divergence and we&#39;re seeing trouble ahead and everybody feels it differently a little bit depending as this shows like what income level you&#39;re in um right now as well like the disparity is just getting bigger the question is like when are we going to see and I&#39;m like purposely overstating it but when are we going to see like riots in the streets yeah never not not anytime soon I mean the Chinese were the closest to having riots in the street and that&#39;s why they went from you know hunting down out you know Jack ma to wanting to basically put him in PR prison two years ago to now inviting him to meet with xinping and shaking his hand and giving him an award at the most recent uh CEO conference in China so uh I&#39;d be more worried about the risk she really push pushed it up to the edge he had 20% of 25 year olds with education unemployed that&#39;s that&#39;s a formula for a tan square and he was able to Pivot just in time because you saw the the protesting increasing around the country and now he&#39;s flipped everyone&#39;s got says okay the guy had a huge tolerance for pain he&#39;s flipped the switch and now we&#39;re back off to the races in China so so that&#39;s in the rearview mirror now what you&#39;re what you&#39;re blinded not you but the person who uh constructed this chart and article are blinded by is the fact that this is no different than anytime else what they&#39;re comparing it to is a one once in 100y year aberation when the government decided to pump the money pump the economy full of s trillion dollars and put it in the hands of people who historically are not Savers and uh and they&#39;ve proven to the point that they&#39;re still not Savers because they spent it as fast as they could now that it&#39;s running out they&#39;re going back to their normal savings level pre pandemic which was effectively zero and that&#39;s the way it&#39;s always been and uh it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s just you know it&#39;s not a commentary good or bad it&#39;s just the way it is uh as far as whether they&#39;ll they&#39;ll uh they&#39;ll be discontent related to that I think that uh you&#39;re going to see an acceleration of real wages and growth in the economy uh and productivity like you saw in Trump 1.0 in Trump 2.0 in coming quarters and they will be the primary beneficiary so while they&#39;re not saving I think you&#39;re going to see their wages continue to creep up uh and um and and uh but but as far as them Having excess savings the last five years was the exception not the rule yeah no absolutely because we gave them free money like corre that uh like to to quote somebody like somebody&#39;s probably I think Adam tager mentions that a lot like the pick is through the python like I think the pick has been digested almost and uh excrement it I don&#39;t know like correct and look you&#39;ll have credit card defaults that level I mean that&#39;s that&#39;s nothing new it h it happens every single cycle but if you look at high yield credit spreads which is what I pay attention to if you want to worry about if the world is coming to an end worry about high yield credit spreads and right now they&#39;re telling you uh all is Quiet on the Western Front it could change tomorrow but for now it&#39;s in good stead and if companies can refinance their debt and they can hit the capital markets all is well talk about inflation and wage growth I think that&#39;s an interesting combination I how worried are you about inflation in general and wage growth is roughly at 5.7% as we&#39;re you know I checked last week it might be different now but roughly around 5.7% like how how does that fit together are you worried about that is that too too much like how does that fit together yeah I mean look uh Elon Musk is basically firing anyone with a pulse that&#39;s willing to leave uh in the in the public sector I think it&#39;s you know probably in some sense maybe they&#39;ll overshoot and have to rehire some people but in some sense it&#39;s long overdue the issue is going to be uh whether or not the bulk of the people who have had jobs in the public sector uh will or will not be absorbed by the private SE sector I.E does their skill set translate to Value ad which is required in the private sector and the answer is we don&#39;t know yet so I think what you&#39;re going to see is a tick up in the unemployment rate uh which will be offsetting the inflationary Tendencies you&#39;re going to see deflation from the decreased government spending you&#39;re going to see inflation from some of the other parts of the economy um you know rents are still elevated uh housing is still elevated but what as bessent and Trump execute on their plan to bring the 10e yield down why would they focus on that versus the short end of the curve they focus on that because all mortgages are priced off of that all long-term loans are priced off of that and their ability to refinance the US debt is priced off of that and\n\n### MACRO_DATA_SLIDES\nlook at high yield credit spreads which is what I pay attention to if you want to worry about if the world is coming to an end worry about high yield credit spreads and right now they&#39;re telling you uh all is Quiet on the Western Front it could change tomorrow but for now it&#39;s in good stead and if companies can refinance their debt and they can hit the capital markets all is well talk about inflation and wage

curve they focus on that because all mortgages are priced off of that all long-term loans are priced off of that and their ability to refinance the US debt is priced off of that and finally\n\n### MEDIA_APPEARANCE_RECAP\nfinally\n\nthe US treasuries are looking to see some semblance of fiscal responsibility and cutting costs so that they can have confidence uh to own hold our debt and and we are showing clear steps in that direction uh we will get to hundreds of billions I don&#39;t know whether we&#39;ll get to a trillion or two trillion for sure I bet against it but the key is Direction and perception and right now that&#39;s moving in the right direction right now that is a deflationary factor offsetting the natural inflationary factors we I think the number one thing is they&#39;re going to have to be careful because at 120% debt to GDP we have not been at this level since post World War II 1948 and how did they bring debt to GDP down from 120% down to 63 by 1956 it&#39;s very simple they ran nominal growth hot GDP ran hot and inflation ran above Trend call it three to four and a half percent over that time period above their 2% Target uh and I think we&#39;re going to have to run it at that level this time and if they do too much on the government spending front uh those deflationary headwinds could offset the needed inflation we need to bring debt to GDP down to a more normalized range uh you look at all the productivity factors that are coming into play Workforce productivity is increasing for a first time in a long time and is going to continue accelerate with some of the Technologies uh that&#39;s going to be super positive for nominal growth I think it was Jensen Wong out there talking about the possibility of 10% GDP growth I mean that&#39;s a little bit uh crazy town but you know you&#39;d be amazed what CEOs will say when they&#39;re selling stock at highs and uh trying to get get people to keep the bid in but uh leaving that aside um on balance there are Crosswinds but um constructive for at least the foreseeable 12 to 24 months that doesn&#39;t preclude normal five to 10% Corrections we get on average 3 5% pullbacks a year you know one 10% correction every year in change one 12% correction every 4.1 years so uh but we did have two of those 20% plus Corrections in two years so we may have pulled forward a few years of those bare markets uh in 2020 and 2022 and maybe we&#39;ve got some blue sky for maybe a few more years than people anticipate right now we definitely don&#39;t anticipate it especially on our Channel like we like we always talk look look for the negatives of course maybe because I&#39;m German as well we always look for the negatives right but uh like I don&#39;t want to say we&#39;re doom and gloom Channel but we&#39;re trying to figure out what is happening and we all know that the debt as is is not sustainable especially interest payment we need to we don&#39;t need to go into that but we&#39;re all I&#39;ll let you in on a little secret Kai uh uh Doom and Gloom gets more views so uh so if that&#39;s the goal uh I would stick with the theme good point good point no no absolutely um you you touched on it like the next topic like I really want to talk about how can we get GDP running hot again like how do we get to the 10% that Jensen W suggested and that you quoted him saying that is actually already an indication of where things might be heading is it AI is it new technology really pushing that like it seems like the US really is betting big on AI to save itself meaning like we&#39;ll have to get GDP up if we can&#39;t get debt under control we have to get GDP up to keep that ratio somewhat in check is AI Our Savior Tom I think I think it&#39;s part of the fact I think that&#39;s part of the formula I think uh we&#39;ve seen an increase in productivity but the number one thing that people don&#39;t talk enough about which really helped in Trump 1.0 is passive deregulation you know for every new regulation I think his rule is he&#39;s got to cut four old regulations and you have no idea the amount of Ingenuity and productivity that can be Unleashed when you just take the governor off the accelerator and for years uh politicians have been substantiating their existence by creating more and more regulation putting more and more Governors against growth uh and and um and and Trump is throwing that playbook out and he&#39;s going to unleash American Ingenuity and American creativity and American productivity by just letting business run and yeah some will run too far and they&#39;ll have to be corrected but he&#39;s a believer of the self-correcting mechanism of the markets and uh and and you don&#39;t need a nanny state to tell everyone what to do in every single aspect of their business certainly you have to have uh uh guide rails and uh a core set of rules but the acceleration of the regulation has just uh really hindered growth and put us at a level that um we&#39;re still a small country you know 330 million people uh certainly the largest uh uh GDP and production but I I think we could grow a lot faster if we Unleash the Beast and uh and that&#39;s what Trump did in Trump in 1.0 and we saw the results and and I think that&#39;s what we&#39;re going to see in 2.0 it&#39;s not going to be tomorrow but it&#39;s probably going to be in a few quarters you&#39;re going to start to see it and you see it in CEO confidence numbers their confidence levels in in the future outlook which were at uh very depressed levels in 2024 uh in terms of investing in terms of growth in terms of confidence uh it&#39;s and and what banks are going to be able to do in terms of lending as they start to ease up some of the uh uh restrictions on banks again so I think that people are really uh have to be careful about looking in the rear view mirror and getting caught up in recency bias meaning um thinking that what has happened in the recent past is going to persist into the future and actually zooming out and looking a little further back and see what happened during different periods of history when a different set of conditions and a different Playbook was put into play and uh and the periods of great growth and great uh economic Prosperity\n### MISCELLANEOUS\nso uh the 300 billion number is just the US mag 7 for 2025 uh the Stargate project you know um masi Yoshi came out from soft Bank talking about 200 billion I mean this guy&#39;s a cowboy he&#39;s a a cat that has nine lives I mean you know he almost blew up with Wei work and flushed a ton of investors money with that and yet the guy goes out and raises billions of dollars like it&#39;s no problem and then you know a week after he promises 200 billion he reports that the company lost some you know multi-billions that quarter alone so you can&#39;t make this stuff up but the point is is the direction okay and the direction is going to be in Investments it&#39;s going to be in capital pack is going to be in data centers deep seek was a game changer because what they said what they showed is that uh you can get similar or better results with a lot less money now the question is how much less money is it 95% is it 50% the point is it&#39;s less so it messed with all of the uh 25-year-old analysts Excel spreadsheets and uh it was like a you know mind blow and now everyone&#39;s reconfiguring and you&#39;re seeing Alibaba had a model quen 2.5 that beat both deep seek and open AI in performance on many if you know the majority of metrics and that&#39;s why you&#39;re seeing uh Alibaba go parabolic so I think there&#39;s going to be a tremendous amount of competition uh and the beauty of deep seek uh which I love is that some of their performance was garnered on inferior chips and when I think about inferior chips I say to myself who is the king of inferior chips is Intel okay so if they can generate performance on inferior chips at a much lower cost imagine the possibilities for inferior companies like Intel that are trading as if they&#39;re going out of business uh but if people seem to forget that they did over 50 billion dollar of Revenue in the last 12 months oh and by the way they&#39;re the only place you can get uh excess capacity you know the whole Nvidia story is very very simple um they have grown data center Revenue if you look at the last six eight quarters uh $4 billion do per quarter that sounds pretty unbelievable except for the fact that the base of the business has gotten much larger so that $4 billion dollar of Revenue growth each quarter uh a year or two ago uh equaled 250% Revenue growth today it&#39;s less than half of that and by the end of the year it will be less than 50% because that it&#39;s not necessarily a demand issue right now it&#39;s more of a supply issue and they are relying on the kindness of strangers and what I&#39;m trying to say is they are not the captain of their own ship they are completely dependent on Taiwan semiconductor&#39;s capacity to produce and Taiwan semiconductor is producing at or Beyond capacity right now which is why they are limited to four billion in growth I think Intel is going to be a solution for that down the road but in the meantime if you have a company trading at 30 times sales and 44 times earnings with d accelerating growth you have to be worried about that and with a CEO filing to sell more than a billion plus dollars in the last few months uh you know I don&#39;t watch what people say I watch what they do and that&#39;s why you&#39;ve seen negative returns for NVIDIA since June and most people would not guess that if you talk to the average Uber driver who&#39;s excited about Nvidia changing the world I don&#39;t know much about Nvidia person I don&#39;t follow their like I don&#39;t read the quarterly or anything like I know what they do obviously and I know but not in detail but it&#39;s like I&#39;m my gut feeling like I I love my gut feeling by the way but I&#39;ve been watching some YouTube channels about graphics card like they they came out with a new 50 Series recently and they&#39;re all negative like too expensive performance not really like where what they promised um MSRP is not achievable and then tariffs on top of it as well like an extra $50 for a graphics card which is supposed to be $579 makes a difference right so like I&#39;d be cautious like I don&#39;t own any viia it&#39;s not part of the market I own or play and but I&#39;d be cautious personally at least like for the next quarter delivery roll out doesn&#39;t seem to be great only influencers getting graphics cards right now everything&#39;s really really interesting signs if you follow that um you you touched on Taiwan I want to take it one further I want to take one Island further east and would need to talk Japan real quick um cuz that&#39;s something we briefly discussed off air and I&#39;ve been trying to fit it in um segue really is inflation in Japan like 4% um La last month and that could really derail things for everybody meaning liquidity is is uh what do you call it like on high alert for for a lack of better term because the Yen carry trade could get unraveled here rather quickly meaning if the Japanese Central Bank decides to raise interest rates the cheap money could disappear that&#39;s been propping up the US market um correct let&#39;s let&#39;s talk about that a little bit and how much of a risk do you see there well all you need to do is look at inflation numbers and look at what the uh Bank of Japan has been doing inflation has been going up and Bank of Japan has been hiking uh and they&#39;ve been trying to hold back hiking as much as they can because of what happened in August uh and they haven&#39;t been able to so they&#39;re going to continue to hike inflation&#39;s going to continue to go up why because they&#39;ve been printing money since I can remember and um and I think what&#39;s going to happen is uh that that free what most people don&#39;t realize is a lot of the um support Behind The Magnificent Seven trade one was attributable to earnings which are now decelerating uh and two was attributable to free money exactly as you hit that nail on the head Kai uh in that that is now going to shrivel up because uh as as uh the jgbs start to have higher and higher yields there&#39;s a cost of of holding that position and people are going to say well now you know when when money is free like it was in 2022 you know when the FED fund rate was a lot lower what did you see you just saw people throwing money at Venture Capital anything that had startup people were throwing money at in 2020 2021 and then 2022 the chickens came home to roost well it&#39;s not that much different with with the carry trade free money now drying up that that carry trade money wasn&#39;t going into startups it was going into mag s and I think that&#39;s going to uh be in question and certainly I&#39;m not I&#39;m not calling for any type of Correction like a lot of people say well all the concentration it&#39;s got to be like the Tech record 2000 I don&#39;t think it&#39;s going to be that I I I just think they&#39;ve had they pulled forward a lot of gains they&#39;re making a huge amount of investment so what has helped the gains well one they&#39;ve been able to buy back unlimited amounts of stock so if if you make the pieces bigger earnings per share uh goes up but now they&#39;re taking that money and they are uh defensively spending in AI where they have not yet definitively produced any type of return t\n\nand Bank of Japan has been hiking uh and they've been trying to hold back hiking as much as they can

to go towards BuyBacks which increased earnings per share is now going into uh data centers and the like uh hoping that they get a return in three years so earnings uh growth is decelerating margins are going to start to decelerate on those companies uh and um and then the the financing of that which was the carry trade uh in in large part is going away so is that where you want to be no and

w\n\nmoney gone it&#39;s gone to International it&#39;s gone to China Tech it&#39;s gone to uh a lot of places that were on not on most people&#39;s Bingo cards coming into the year uh and um you know places that uh we we have aggressively large positions let&#39;s turn it around what should be on our B Bingo cart for the rest of 2025 here Tom like what what are you looking at you you touched on a few things like Emerging Markets you just I don&#39;t want to repeat what you just said here yeah but uh what what else should we be adding what are you looking for like deep values like I wrote down a name that you mentioned somewhere else was PayPal and uh sort of like Intel like the the the uh the vultures are circling I think around PayPal so I&#39;m curious that that&#39;s what&#39;s what I&#39;m picking up there&#39;s so much competition claron many other platforms venmo um and all those direct payment like platforms these days like why why is Paypal for example an interesting one and why should be an our bingo card yeah well the good news of uh of PayPal is that they own venmo so that&#39;s good venmo&#39;s a verb uh number two is uh you know we were pounding the table on that in the 60s it shot up to 90 it&#39;s now come off to 75 or 73 uh because the their guidance was uh lower than the market Market wanted but if you look back to last year Alex Chris did the exact same thing he sandbags he sets expectations low and then he destroys them on the upside and that&#39;s exactly what he&#39;s going to do this year uh on the basis of his sandbagger percentage I mean how much lower did he guide cash flow and earnings last year relative to what he performed we expect that they&#39;re not going to do seven billion of free cash flow this year they&#39;re going to do eight billion of free cash flow this year and they&#39;re going to use that to buy back stock so you know um they&#39;ve just authorized a $5 billion buyback it&#39;s a 7075 billion market cap company they&#39;re going to buy in 20% of the stock so uh other than that how was the play Mrs Lincoln I mean you you&#39;ve got so much positive stuff happening they have their investor day today and they&#39;re explaining brain treat most people don&#39;t understand like when they take an Uber that is Paypal why because they own brain tree okay which does all the Uber processing when they uh order tickets for a concert uh through Ticket Master Etc so you know they&#39;re doing 500 billion dollars of Enterprise Bend that no one knows because it&#39;s not branded checkout their fast lane improves conversion for small business people like yourself from you know sub 50% to 80% uh they have and and uh the other reason that the market why why it&#39;s sold off after you know going up 50% quickly um is that he been firing unprofitable customers so customers that were at margins that the company actually loses money he said oh yeah I have a unique concept we&#39;re in business to make money so any clients that we&#39;re losing money on we&#39;re going to just fire and the the analysts the 24 year olds with their Excel spreadsheets say growth is decelerating meanwhile cash flow per share is going up earnings per share is going up margins uh um transaction margin is going up and it&#39;s just the beginning Alex Chris what ran 50% of into it the small business division uh the stock was like a double digit multibagger over his tenure and he ran 50% of revenues and he&#39;s going to do the exact same thing and he&#39;s going to keep under promising and overd delivering and somewhere around $120 $150 per share people are going to figure it out and you&#39;re gonna have people upgrading at the top and it&#39;ll run you know just like it overshot to the downside at $60 it&#39;s going to overshoot to the upside probably at 175 or 200 and when everyone gets excited and they&#39;re clamoring for it like some of the other shiny objects we&#39;ve seen recently come off the boil uh will help them out and we&#39;ll lay off our stock but until then it&#39;s trading at a dramatic discount to intrinsic value it&#39;s got an incredible Catalyst with Alex Chris running the ship and uh and we&#39;re very excited about PayPal to my defense venmo doesn&#39;t exist in Europe at least as far as I know so I do apologize for being ignorant that actually PayPal owns it I didn&#39;t know that most people don&#39;t actually actually you know probably half the people that are negative on the stock don&#39;t know that they own Beno so nothing to worry about there maybe they should hire a PR Company I don&#39;t know like uh it&#39;s an interesting thought because PR Tre another one as well like I don&#39;t think people always like what I&#39;ve been hearing about PayPal are fully aware what&#39;s going on all they see is like people using venmo and other platforms like there&#39;s other banking platforms like revolute and all those now these days that that they&#39;re competing with and there&#39;s like oh PayPal is dead right yeah but uh like my all my us friends give me doooo for like not using venmo and not being available on venmo to send me money when we go out or something I was like I don&#39;t have it yeah well you know look what we try to do as good investors is burden oursel with the facts so we read the public filings we listen to the conference calls we study the competition and and we don&#39;t enter an investment uh unless we have confidence if if uh we had to put in 100% of our net worth to own the company uh as equity and JP Morgan was going to finance the debt for us to take over the entire company would we do the deal and you know at a company trading at 30 times sales and 44 times earnings I&#39;m probably not going to put up 100% of my net worth to own the company uh because if I&#39;m wrong uh JP Morgan gets the company and I get zero uh but a company like PayPal where it&#39;s generating you know eight seven eight billion dollars of free cash I&#39;d do that every single day of the week I&#39;d put a 100 so hey JP Morgan if you&#39;re listening uh you want to finance the debt I&#39;ll put up 100% of my net worth and have some meaningful equity in it let&#39;s do the deal absolutely no makes a lot of sense and you just really made the point of this channel as well educate yourself and you&#39;ll be ahead of everybody else absolutely that&#39;s right right um Tom last question and again this is not like Financial advice or anything like but I&#39;m going to ask you like the million dollar question is if I were if you were to invest a million dollars today how would you invest that money it&#39;s a good question I mean you know a couple months ago was easy I&#39;d put it all in Alibaba uh that&#39;s been home run that&#39;s our largest position and we&#39;re not Geniuses it took us we built it for two years when no one wanted it every time it dipped we were buyers you know and why why would we have that confidence when everyone else was saying it&#39;s uninvestable and uh Chinese Communist and all that stuff is because it&#39;s the same leader running the country when the stock was at $320 the only difference is uh I could buy it in 2024 at 2014 prices and the revenues are up 10 X the earnings per share are up five or 6X cash flow per share was up five or 6X so there&#39;s not a whole lot to think about there leader in AI leader in Cloud uh top retailer to the middle class and upper class as the economy recovers and the and the government flipped the switch a month a year and a half ago started doing stimulus and dribs and drabs and now it&#39;s building up the beach ball has been held underwater and now it&#39;s exploding upwards so any dips to buy in a company like Alibaba which is our largest position is interesting uh I would also be interested in basic uh simple companies like uh crown castle they own 40,000 cell towers it generates cash they just sold they&#39;re selling off their fiber business generating eight billion dollars of cash they&#39;re going to pay down debt it yields 7% while you wait that&#39;ll probably be up 50% over the next you know year and a half to two years uh boring companies like Baxter International they do uh medical devices IV Solutions infusion pumps Etc they just sold off uh their Kidney Care business to Carlile for 3.4 billion they&#39;re paying down debt they&#39;re going to have a new CEO announced soon and the reason that&#39;s so important is because the kidney care business was the slowest growth division in the company which meant it lowered earnings growth rate which lowered the multiple to low double digits and I think as people start to see in coming quarters what the business looks like and the growth rate looks like without the kidney business and with lower interest EXP more free cash flow uh that multiple is going to rate to 18 or 20 times even if the growth is you know mid single digits uh and that stock could be you know up from 35 to 60 or so again this is opinion not advice but these are the things we own and we share and we deal exclusively with family offices and ultra high net worth individuals so they&#39;re sophisticated investors and they they understand what we&#39;re doing uh but you know these are opportunities for newer investors s or uh people who aren&#39;t uh institutional investors to start to research to companies and see whether or not it makes sense and talk with their financial advisors uh and see whether uh buying more growth for Less dollars is a good strategy and we have found over many years that it&#39;s an incredible strategy have done right yeah no absolutely and you know there&#39;s so many single stocks that you could pick from it once you educate yourself on them you&#39;re way ahead of everybody else that&#39;s that&#39;s one of the reasons I like the mining game because that&#39;s where I feel I have a leg up on on others right and uh it&#39;s the exact same principle no Tom really appreciate the conversation really enjoyed our our interview here like where can we send our audience where can we find more of your

means a lot to us leave a comment leave a like down below how are you positioned in the markets what are you looking at these days how nervous or impacted are you by the tariffs uh something I haven&#39;t heard from my audience before so please put that down below as well uh I talked about graphics cards and $50 being added there as well is that something you see on other products put that down below I would do want to hear from you thank you so much for tuning in we&#39;ll be back with lots more thank [Music] you and we&#39;re back so that&#39;s the broad overview also want to thank fahed Saleem for including me in his article on yaf Yahoo finance about Alibaba you definitely want to read that one when you have a chance on hedge fund tips and as a theme for what we&#39;re going to be discussing today I want you to hear a couple quick minutes from Legend Peter Lynch here we go but you should study history and history is the important thing you learn from what you learn from history is the market goes down it goes down a lot the math is simple there&#39;s been 93 years of century this is easy to do the markets had 50 declines of 10% or more so 50 declines in 93 years about once every two years the market Falls 10% we call that a correction that means that&#39;s a euphemism for losing a lot of money rapidly but we you know we call it a correction and uh uh so 50 declines in 93 years about once every two years the market Falls 10% of those 50 declines 15 have been 25% or more that&#39;s known as a bare market we&#39;ve had 15 declines in 93 years so every six years the Market&#39;s going to have a 25% decline that&#39;s all you need to know you need to know the Market&#39;s going to go down sometime if you&#39;re not ready for that you shouldn&#39;t own stocks and it&#39;s good when it happens if you like a stock at 14 it goes to six that&#39;s great you understand the company you look at the balance sheet and they&#39;re doing fine you hoping to get to 22 with it 14 to 22 is terrific 6 to 22 is exceptional so you take advantage of these declines they&#39;re going to happen no one knows when they&#39;re going to happen it would be very people tell you about it after the fact that they predicted it but they predicted it 53 times and uh so you can take advantage of the volatility Market if you understand what you own uh so I think that&#39;s the key the element another key element is that you have plenty of time people are an unbelievable rush to buy a stock I&#39;ll give you an example of a well-known company Walmart went public in October of 1970 1970 went public already had a great record it had 15 years performance great Bal sheet you could have waited 10 years saying you&#39;re a very conservative investor you&#39;re not sure this Walmart can make it you want to check you&#39;re you see them operate in small towns you&#39;re afraid they can only make it in seven or eight states you want to wait till they go to more States you keep waiting you can bought Walmart 10 years after they went public and made 35 times your money if you bought it when they went public you would have made 500 times your money but you going waited 10 years after wmart went public and made uh 30 over 30 times your money and we&#39;re back and our\n\nyears so every six years the Market&#39;s going to have a 25% decline that&#39;s all you need to

and\n\n### MISCELLANEOUS\nwant to thank my buddy over at RBC\n\n### MISCELLANEOUS\nRBC\n\nMarket taking a little bit of a breather uh I think we're getting close to that bounce and here's what he's looking at you know basically in the uh first year you get into that 10 11 12 weeks we should be getting a bounce here retest we're kind of in this Zone here before we get a monster rally going into effectively the summer before peeking out that's kind of the the model next year will'll be a little more Rocky depending on where you are in the market but uh I think we're going to make a lot of hay while the sunshines here and I'm very very excited and and took advantage uh as we said this week with vanney and I think uh in coming weeks we're going to be a lot higher than we were on the day of that interview so you can see here on the daily kind of getting oversold here uh 10year yield completely rolled over we'll get a little bit of a bounce here I'm sure oversold bounce just like I think we'll get an oversold bounce in mag 7 so you know uh um ### TECHNICAL_CHARTS\nNvidia down almost a third now since we published that article in June uh and we'll get a 10-point bounce and people will say oh this is great blah blah blah uh but you know for all the reasons we've covered in previous podcasts I I think these things are going to be in a Range Consulting a lot a lot of gains for a long period of time and there's going to be a ton of money made Elsewhere on to the charts of the week so want to cover these this I thought was interesting the Commodities to equities ratio versus the US dollar um and you can see here the um different trade weighted index uh and how Commodities are at a bottom like we saw in when 20201 and prior to that in Reagan's second turn term before Commodities turned up and some of the overvalued pockets normalized this is the key to the market the 10-year bond yield that's the chart that you should be looking at every day not Donald Trump's tweets about this tariff or that tariff that's just a sideshow that's got everyone distracted from the real focus at uh heart here which is the carry trade unwind and uh if it if it relates to owning Tech uh are tariffs important yes but you have to keep in mind you know these are not 25% compounded at 10% a year this is a oneoff level up uh uh not compounded every year so it's just going to be a tax on the poor that's effectively what it is if it goes through and I would not make that bet uh I think what you're going to find is some compromise and somewhere in the middle and the market will be relieved and it will move forward just like it does that's why you see in this in the uh first year after the election that January through March early March period gets extremely volatile because the market likes certainty they don't care if the policy is good or bad they just care that they know what it is so they know what the rules of the game are and once Wall Street knows the rules of the game then they get on with making money because that's what Wall Street does this is a chart from the uh from Lou basanes via Charlie Bello and we've covered this many times but it's critically important to understand because people are so stooped in recency bias uh from the zero interest rate policy period that favored uh mag 7 and stocks trading at 10 times sales and all the things that uh uh were were frothy and you can see going back you know 40 50 some odd years every every 10 years it just switches back and forward from us outperformance to International outperformance from us performance to International outperformance which you saw in the second term of Reagan us outperformance International outperformance Etc and this time will be no different we have started a period here uh in recent months of uh us out performance and if this was updated we'd probably start to see the red with International dramatic outperformance um as a matter of fact the spread between mag 7 and the tremendous 10 top internet Giants is 42% of outperformance year to date with mag 7 down uh 7.7 and the tremendous 10 up some 35% uh here's Matt Sur minaro uh oversold vix one month minus vix three months is usually where you get a bounce we agree we're going to show you a bunch of things that point to a bounce in coming weeks and I and I do think we're going to wind up higher a couple weeks out uh than we are now and a and maybe a lot higher this shows some of the stuffing taken out in the last few days uh last La you know year-to dat Amazon down probably at this point down 19 20% uh Microsoft probably 20% Google over 20% ### TECHNICAL_CHARTS\nNvidia closer to 30% maybe now uh Bitcoin probably 30% Palante tier I think was down another 10% today so probably 40% uh maybe 45% uh coinbase that's probably down 50% this was La at the end of last week that he put out these numbers Tesla's probably 50% Etc so um fcoin shockingly down 89% it may be down 95% now and uh that's how it goes here's again just to reminder when you guys feel bumps in the road the next couple of weeks uh just know that this is exactly the playbook for postelection cycle years uh and then get ready buckle up we're going straight up through the summer and and and no one's going to know what hit them and whether you look at this one or you look at Ned Davis research this is just a composite going all the way back uh in this case uh where does he start this data I know most of them are going going back to 1955 um here's uh home builders we want to be looking for buyers as rates come down the the big play that everyone's going to be surprised about is I think home builders will come back but I'd rather play it through the leverage on The Leverage which is uh the Stanley Black and& Decker the generx of the world uh the suppliers that are going to be monsters as rates go down and uh same thing with the car I don't want the Builders of the homes I want the ones that Supply the Builders of the homes I don't want the automakers I want the suppliers of the automakers like Cooper standard and uh we're going to cover some really interesting things that President Trump said in his uh address this to Congress this week about car loans so we'll just keep that Cliffhanger going um and you can see Microsoft's evaluation tracking the 10year real Bond yield inversely uh this is just another way of saying that as yields go up the multiple on Microsoft y Japanese bond yields go up the yield the the multiple paid on Microsoft goes down and they're talking about tariffs to explain why us-based company tech companies are down which makes zero sense uh but that's why you tune in here to get the scoop and to set yourself up for Success dividend players jump to a 2.5 month High versus non-payers we love the dividend payers and all the type of stocks we've talked about uh are are going to benefit from that and many in the whether it's Health Care with the backers whether it's the Stanley Black and Decker dividend Aristocrat type stock you want to have exposure margin debt Rises to 2021 levels well on the one hand that implies that you get a tech wreck like you had in 2022 we've already kind of had it 20% maybe we'll have a little bit more uh in those overvalued Pockets but I do think they're getting close to a technical bounce area and I do think that they will trade in a range for some time bouncing around while other things outperform but what this doesn't account for is the fact that the value of the market is much higher than it was so the the margin debt as a percentage is still lower but I get the point they're trying to make it's just not scaled correctly southbound February buying the most since early 2021 uh so that was a a very positive period for Chinese stocks average price move in the so you can see here on average Mondays and Fridays have been the weakest uh since for for 2025 and then going all the way back to 1928 Mondays have always been the weakest uh with you know Fridays coming in a close second so my guess is we probably do turn around Tuesday however we do have the jobs report tomorrow that could be a catalyst if it comes in week from all the layoffs in Washington then uh maybe you could see expectations for a Fed cut coming in earlier than June and if it's really bad this month is on the table for the FED not probabilistic but from a nonp possibility to a possibility that's going to impact interest rates which is going to impact car loans which is going to impact mortgages which is going to impact the ability for the US to refinance boatloads of debt at lower rates uh some of this uh chaos may be less by accident and more by Design than originally thought so what are we keeping our eyes on Japanese government bond yields followed by European bond yields pay close attention because if those blow out number one you're going to have the ECB cutting okay so that's stimulative that already number two you have uncertainty like 2011 because they have high debt to GDP and they still uh the structurally set up in a very fragile way the way that they are unable to uh issue Bonds in the same way that the U us can um creates complications so we saw that in 2011 if fear about that shows up then there will be a further and stronger bid into us treasuries and that's potentially where we get the three handle on the 10year which again no one's bingo card except the incredible amazing listeners of hedge fun tips with Tom Hayes so uh you see this stuff lots of bears for stocks near new high okay this is Market concentration as it's ever been share of the top five companies by market cap in the S&P 500 so look these are historically unsustainable and all that means is it's going to be a rotation out of what's concentrated and into what's unconcentrated and that doesn't necessarily uh imply a crash uh of the indices it can be a a rotation with those stalling out and others picking up as their earnings growth accelerates and as the concentrated numbers decelerate so theme over and over now playing out in real time um most of the world is is surprised and no one\n\n### MACRO_DATA_SLIDES\nexpectations for a Fed cut coming in earlier than June and if it's really bad this month is on the table for the FED not probabilistic but from a nonp possibility to a possibility

Skyrocket that&#39;s why this if this job Department if this jobs report comes in Weak it&#39;s going to be very constructive from a market standpoint because it brings the FED back into play much sooner than ever you know just a few weeks ago everyone saiding no Cuts because of the CPI report CPI is seasonally strong in January and February uh so that&#39;s a fake out and now we get to see what&#39;s under the surface and we also got to keep a strong eye on this GDP now at negative - 2.4% for q1 that&#39;s a big deal fortunately the GDP now has been wrong of late but you know two quarters is a is a recession and I think that that is low probability right now with 18% earnings growth and I think the numbers of uh uh at ATA fed are probably wrong again but you have to pay attention and keep keep your biases aside and deal with the facts and so far credit spreads are saying uh their numbers are probably wrong uh us initial jobless claims hit highest okay DC we got that bond yields going down we&#39;ve been expecting that that&#39;s happened uh cap backs we&#39;ve covered pening holds uh inflows into Europe everyone&#39;s chasing up so maybe we&#39;ll have some problems with the European bonds and that&#39;ll shake up their market and we&#39;ll see some flows we&#39;ll we&#39ll we&#39ll pay attention to that record outflow from crypto so a lot of um a lot of risk on stuff showing some some fear uh here&#39;s Seth golden with the a aii bull bear spread you can see uh when it gets this extreme um you know year out 6 months out on average you&#39;re up 133% 20 uh a year later you&#39;re up 22% this is international stocks second best month versus US stocks in the last 15 years by the way 15 years every 10 to 15 years it&#39;s it flips from us to International doesn&#39;t mean the international that us does bad it just means International does better what else we got here big rotation from mag 7 to China battic we talked about this tremendous 10 these are going straight up those are coming down they&#39;re going to meet in the middle and then China&#39;s going to exceed it just like China dramatically outperformed and then they caught caught up and one caught up and one caught down we&#39;re going to see mag 7 catch down and Chinese stocks catch up led by which Ali effen Baba bull markets last longer than you think we&#39;re only at 60 the average is 67 months we are only at 28 months so we&#39;re halfway there uh Living on a Prayer and uh there we go uh Europe stocks breaking out this looks pretty healthy even if you get a pullback uh probably a deal with zalinski is what uh what&#39;s what set what sets that up number of unsold completed homes for sale eye on the housing markets you&#39;re seeing a lot of weakness in Florida houses inventory is super high prices being cut 10 20% that is often a precursor for other frothy areas around the country uh so we&#39;ll keep an eye out on that and I will have a front row seat in Orange County we shall see as the chin marginal CH uh Chinese dollar stops flowing in because fomo is happening in China with everything starting to go up um you know maybe we will see some some opportunities abound uh here as well big Tech big decline we got that um this is another analog for the first year of the presidential cycle again some weakness in late February through mid-march and then straight up into summer so there&#39;s the dollar Index just rolling over uh what else do we have here that the Atlanta fed GDP keeping an eye on that Euro Zone loans to households so credit expansion is starting to happen in Europe to businesses as well PMI manufacturing back in expansion in China mag 7 so again I think we&#39;re back down here probably get a technical bounce here so for those of you who really like those stocks probably get a little bit of bargain for us the margin of safety even at these discounted levels is not where we want to see it but they definitely will probably work as a trade for many of you that like to do that stuff it&#39;s not what we do uh let&#39;s see S&P companies outperforming year on year uh this type of acceleration of breath uh is is um is very healthy and it&#39;s actually what we saw in when 2001 when small cap value and international dramatically outperformed even though there was some weakness short-term weakness in the economy and Tech got smashed ### HEADLINES_AND_NEWS\nother periods where you saw this was the second term of trump where well again a second term of Reagan where again International outperformed domestic as we saw the chart earlier Friday&#39;s advancing volume second highest since uh covid 202&#39;s Market recovery interesting uh uh I don&#39;t know why okay uh here we go dollar rolling over oh this is interesting the EU Aerospace and defense index up dramatically relative to the mag7 index a lot of things are up relative it&#39;s it&#39;s not hard to beat 7.7% if you go to mag which is the mag 7 ETF it&#39;s down 7.7% maybe a little more by the close 10year yield down for seven straight weeks remember at 480 everyone was calling for five and I said three handle before five handle and uh we may not see a five handle before Trump is out of office so um that&#39;s that Goldman Sachs top down S&P 500 forecast we talk about guidance coming down home affordability is the lowest it&#39;s been since 20067 8 that doesn&#39;t mean we&#39;re going to have a housing crisis but I do think we are going to have some normalization of prices probably somewhat offset by lower mortgage rates creating demand so it&#39;ll be a wash and that affordability will go up as the cost of ownership goes down you know if you take a 10year from 480 down to 350 and you get 30-year fix rates at 5.5 the affordability from 7 two which it was a week ago not a week ago a month ago for a 30-year fix down to 55 uh you know that&#39;s huge that cuts 25 30% off the monthly payment and uh even if uh prices come down 10% I think you&#39;re going to see huge demand bids so not a housing crisis but an opportunity in the making except where there&#39;s super froth you know there&#39;s some areas where houses doubled after Co then doubled again uh those I could getting hit 30% may you know uh but we&#39;ll see chop frustration is normal we got that uh shortterm sentiment extremely pessimistic that&#39;s just another indicator pointing to a technical bounce here in coming days and weeks put volume second highest Spike of all time um you know so that tends to be a contrarian indicator large caps to small caps S&P 500 uh divided by Russell 2000 haven&#39;t seen it since 2001 I think you are going to see a ripy face off rally in small caps once we get through this tariff noise and going into the close I do think that Trump was saying that he likes the president of Mexico or something and uh he&#39;s going to back off on certain things I you know it&#39;s dayto day welcome to Trump 2.0 same as Trump 1.0 another day another headline another volatility and it resolves to the upside so uh just uh enjoy enjoy the show ladies and gentlemen growth of okay so that&#39;s that uh bull bear spread we covered crowded and cracking it was momentum and it&#39;s getting smashed I think uh paler was down another 10% or 8% today uh mag seven earnings reminder decelerating uh unmagnify accelerating that&#39;s why the opportunities are going to be in the UNM magnificent 493 and uh coming out of the mag even if you get this technical bounce so uh I it&#39;ll be interesting to see when they get this bounce in the next few weeks how many people chase up when they get near back near the top of the recent range and then they get smacked again but uh time will tell uh 50% of stocks outperforming the S&P 500 up from just 30% last year this is what we saw last when 2001 what happened then regime change International outperformed value outperformed growth International outperformed domestic F value outperform growth small cap outperform large cap ### MISCELLANEOUS\nI continue to repeat this because it continues to not be believed and even as it&#39;s happening right under

active investors have moved closer to the Benchmark since uh 2023 all closet index Huggers complete value list uh in that regard and uh smart people know and have figured that out and allocate to people that are uncorrelated with the indes uh or low correlation because they&#39;re actually doing real work uh 10-year treasury yield rolling over retail investors pile on Hong Kong listings through margin loans yeeha let it rip ladies and gentlemen Mainland buying Baba like it&#39;s going out of style uh as we had anticipated last summer and Brendan ahern&#39;s done a good job job of documenting that on his Twitter feed definitely check him out um us 10-year yield testing 2025 lows no one here is\n\nEuropean stocks rally to start 2025 uncertainty at an all-time high that&#39;s when you want to be a buyer not a seller and that&#39;s the GDP estimates gone down to 2.4% uh Wards Automotive US Auto Sales SAR uh was sales were down 2% in February understandable with consumer confidence through the floor with the fears around tariffs creating inflation again it&#39;s not whether the outcome is good or bad it&#39;s whether Wall Street knows the rules and once we have certainty in policy Market&#39;s going to go straight up on that type of 18.2% earnings growth uh guidance was weak it&#39;s expected to be weak the first two weeks every two two months every year but not as bad as I thought the estimates are still holding in at 271 down from Peak 275 which is really not a big downgrade and 2025 six rather has gone up so as always backend loaded set expectations low exceed them everyone&#39;s happy until late summer when we get some seasonal weakness again but in the mean time the party will be on again on no one&#39;s Bingo cards right now but wait and see and that&#39;s what you will see so crypto flows you know the one thing that the crypto community may have overlooked is be careful what you wish for um you know that the thesis behind Bitcoin in particular because uh some of the others have great like great utility I&#39;ve had great conversations with experts in ethereum I think that&#39;s going to be something to pay attention to as a real platform but uh it&#39;s not what I do so I&#39;m not even going to comment on it and I&#39;m not even it&#39;s just it&#39;s like I&#39;m a golfer I I don&#39;t watch basketball that much so like I can enjoy basketball but I I have zero value at around basketball so I I have I&#39;m completely agnostic about this but as it relates to bitcoin because I see sailor a lot on TV and everything uh and leveraging up like it&#39;s going out of style and borrowing money to buy more Bitcoin and all that stuff and maybe it&#39;ll end well and so far it&#39;s going well and everyone thinks he&#39;s a genius um but what they don&#39;t count on if they get what they want which is a crypto-friendly uh Administration putting regulation in um being pro crypto is that the very thing that put them in the position that they are is the perceived scarcity around Bitcoin and what they may not be accounting for is the amount of assets allocated to crypto um that only have you know three or for legitimate places to go whether Bitcoin ethereum a couple others maybe um when the administration does what they want them to do um hundreds if not thousands of new crypto issuers are going to come to bear and compete for that fixed bucket of crypto assets and you could say well the bucket will grow maybe it&#39;ll grow a bit that that that that&#39;s certainly possible possible that wouldn&#39;t surprise me at all but you are going to have thousands of new issuers getting into the gold rush and while everyone thought the particular coin or token was scarce what they didn&#39;t count on is an is an unlimited supply of coins and tokens that may be quote unquote scarce but the overall bucket becomes unlimited and it dilutes the hell out of each individual one and only the ones that actually have utility in terms of transaction owners ship um uh Etc which is you know one or two um we get washed away so that&#39;s where it is uh I have nothing really valuable to say maybe well we we won&#39;t but um so something to keep in mind uh Brent down I keep looking for more opportunities and energy and I keep pointing right back to com stock resources which we have a big position side by side with Jerry Jones uh none of the other stuff is coming out here&#39;s where we are in terms of tariffs again we&#39;ve covered this on TV uh if he does a 100% of everything we&#39;re still nowhere near where we were uh at the we we would be still below where we were in the mid-20s remember they raised tariffs for some 12 straight years of economic Prosperity before you got to smooth Holly um so that&#39;s that&#39;s where we are that&#39;s where we make maybe if if everything happens but already he&#39;s walking back Mexico so that takes it back down uh we are at record low historic tariffs so just keep that in mind ### MACRO_DATA_SLIDES\nnatural gas going straight through the roof we like that okay Logistics managers this is interesting the logistics managers Index this relates to gxo Rose for a second consecutive month to 62.8 making the strongest growth in logistics sector since June 2022 again dstock cycle to restock cycle which we&#39;ve covered many many times on this podcast sharp increase in inventory levels this led to higher inventory costs in warehousing prices while warehousing capacity decreased because they had a glut of warehousing capacity remember they built out too much because everything that happened at Co Peak now it&#39;s being absorbed um and and so on and so forth so that should bode well for gxo in coming quarters once the CMA stuff is pretty much resolved and the new CEO is announced which will be a rock star if passes any prologue as it relates to the type of people that uh Brad Jacobs attracts share of clients expecting the US to be the best performing Global Equity region at the Goldman Sachs Global strategy conference in January the highest percentage of managers expected us to be the best this year and they were all wrong it&#39;s not even a competition S&amp;P up uh excuse me S&amp;P down close to 1% year to date Europe up up 15% uh kweb up 25% Bob up 65% uh you know there you go that&#39;s that chances of a cut we covered us trade policy uncertainty index I mean this is where opportunities are made everything that got hit by tariffs I think is going to be the buy opportunity of a Sentry in coming weeks um and we&#39;ll just wait and see percentage of companies expected to outpace the mag seven up from just 8% at the lows of second half 2023 going straight up and so on and these are also coincidentally um yeah the times you want that that you start to see massive broadening ### FEATURED_COMPANY_DEEP_DIVES\nAlibaba Shar held via southbound stock connect absolutely ramping up every single Mainland Chinese person is buying Alibaba stock like it&#39;s going out of style billions more billions in billions more to come and the international people will slowly but surely start to be forced in not because they want to invest in China but because they want to keep their jobs and the problem is is they&#39;re so underweight China and they&#39;re so underweight International and they&#39;re dramatically underperforming and they now have job risk so all of the sudden their ideology about G and communism and all the excuses uh go out the window just like you saw with all the woke is broke once they start going up everyone chases them and this time will be no different mortgage rates coming down they&#39;re going to go a lot lower China sets official deficit at decades high level they&#39;re going to stimulate till the cows come home deficit spending like it&#39;s going out of style 4% of GDP that is a big deal massive spending program focused on consumption there&#39;s natural gas going through the roof this was don&#39;t have that date infrastructure daily trading sentiment has fallen to extreme pessimism from Ryan Dietrich uh ndr research rather uh this is where you get these technical bounces so pay attention that&#39;s bespoke same thing a lot of different indicators pointing to the same thing that&#39;s the Fed so last year&#39;s we said the last will be first that&#39;s been the case international Healthcare Etc the first shall be last paler Nvidia they&#39;re probably the uh so they were the best last year uh in the last two weeks paler is down 32% Nvidia is down 16% this is probably uh as of March 4th and that&#39;s just the last two weeks year-to date it&#39;s double that probably on both of those um what else is getting smashed broadcom uh Arista networks Marvel Netflix um Tesla and so on Alibaba stock Rose More than 70% since the January low Euro rebounds to four-month high against the US dollar is weakening euro is strengthening dollar is rolling over similar to Trump 1.0 we covered that look at this move in the euro China switches priority to consumption in work report from highquality development they did a complete 180 degree turnaround from last year and look what&#39;s happening um semiconductor cycle that&#39;s the semiconductor cycle we covered last week small cap out performer this is interesting this is that last time we saw these levels were early 2000s and then again in 2009 and then we had an A Monster outperformance in small caps following those periods so it&#39;s definitely worth paying attention to there&#39;s the kweb just getting started cranking uh kudos to Brenan we were in the Foxhole together I remember when we played golf together uh someone and I I put a picture on Twitter I think it was in the late summer or early fall or something like that and uh it was near the lows and someone said uh Tom and brandan getting together is going to Mark the bottom in China and they were right it basically went straight up ever since then so uh so that&#39;s that um here&#39;s another put volume this this is a wash out all these people that record Put volume on the day I was on with vanney those people are going to get flushed the sellers of the puts are going going to be the ones that made all the money the buyers are going to get smoked um you you know just for future reference ladies and gentlemen you want to buy insurance on your house before you have a fire it&#39;s amazing how many people buy puts in the hole when the not only is the price near the bottom but the implied volatility is at record highs and people are buying puts in the hole as if that&#39;s going to protect them uh it&#39;s too late you know you can&#39;t call Chub after after the house is half burning down it&#39;s just one the premiums would be too high and two they don&#39;t protect much because you only get half a house so uh leave it at that want to put this guy on uh he had some interesting things to say about uh daily domestic consumption U David final question for you we&#39;ve we&#39;ve yet to talk about tariffs in this specific conversation and the re the reason I frame it that way is I&#39;m curious to what extent tariffs or the external challenges will be referenced these next few days well I let me be fair Frank okay I I strongly believe this time around tariff is no longer a big issue I would even if you give me a order of three top issues in China or challenges in China I don&#39;t even put top three even among the top three the Tariff from president Trump in fact the whole economy Was preparing for 40% even 60% of tariff hike from president Trump now he&#39;s only imposing 10% of course they indirect tariff upon Chinese uh products from Mexico from Canada from Europe but overall it&#39;s still smaller than people anticipated it&#39;s smaller than uh the year of 2018 so this time around we the Chinese economy is fully fully prepared I do not think the the Tariff is big issue the really to deal with tariff is the same as deal with other issues in Chinese economy that is to boost domestic consumption and on this issue there&#39;s already tremendous tremendous discussions and also a lot of policies will be implemented down the road and we&#39;re back uh ### HEADLINES_AND_NEWS\nAlibaba stock is rising why is Bucking the tech selloff uh obviously

process sources say they&#39;re not doing this out of the kindness to strangers they are doing this in their own self-interest the reason we got bearish on Nvidia in June and wrote the article on June 20th intitled the next pain trade which you can find at hedge fund tips.com uh and while you&#39;re there you should go to uh terms this is opinion not advice talk to your financial advisor uh don&#39;t do anything uh be conservative don&#39;t listen to anything I say uh terms and conditions there um they the the reason it&#39;s not because AI is not going to happen and it&#39;s not because Nvidia is a Bad Company both of those things are are not true a AI is everything that you think great is going to happen in AI is going to happen it&#39;ll probably take a little longer than you think but it will happen most likely number two uh the problem with their decelerating growth rate it&#39;s not declining demand they have more demand than they can produce it&#39;s they are not the captain of their own ship they rely on the kindness of strangers and Taiwan semiconductors is only giving them $4 billion per quarter and that&#39;s their limitation as the base goes larger and they&#39;re still only growing at 4 billion the growth rate is decelerating uh not because they don&#39;t have demand because they don&#39;t have capacity they rely on Taiwan semiconductor if Taiwan semiconductor blew up tomorrow Nvidia would be out of business okay that&#39;s not going to happen but they need intel to be doing it and the good news is Intel is going to do it and it&#39;s going to be a money machine and no one is prepared for that except for the folks listening here I loved this article from Craig Bartlett who was the former CEO and chair of Intel he says Intel is back stop talking about breaking it up what he&#39;s saying was they should fire the board and rehire Ginger and I actually agree with that it&#39;s not going to happen but they fired Ginger at the five yard line you know it takes years to build a Fab okay and the idea of Taiwan semiconductor investing a 100 billion or whatever they&#39;re going to do to build Fabs good luck we&#39;ll see you in 5 to 10 years Intel is there that&#39;s why Nvidia and broadcom are already testing the production in their 18a facility which is showing really good results and will probably be live before the end of the year and hockey stick and no one&#39;s expecting and that&#39;s going to be where the excess capacity when Intel recovers uh Nvidia will catch a bid because there will be capacity for them uh to to to expand beyond that $4 billion a quarter which is decelerating growth rate so um I think this board made a huge mistake Brack and Daryl Besson says housing will unfreeze in weeks seize 2% inflation I don&#39;t know

Advanced Auto Parts we are running long on time so we've got to get through this and basically what we cover here is\n\nthey look at the end of they they&#39;re sitting on a billion one eight 1.8 billion of of cash they pay down their debt they&#39;re closing the stores that they needed to close they&#39;re consolidating the the supply chains uh listen to this interview we&#39;re not going to play this interview with with uh Shane o Kelly on the podcast because we simply don&#39;t have enough time but if you own one share of this stock you should listen to this interview I mean at the end of the day nothing has changed from my original thesis which is very simple 7% operating margin which they&#39;re still affirming couple years out last time that implies 600 million of operating income 630 million dollar of operating income and the last time they had that was 2019 2022 um there were four times that it hit that level of operating income and in those years the stock traded between $186 and $244 and here we have it at $35 you can&#39;t give it away uh with the balance sheet healthy with a competent management executing on the plan and uh so you know no no big deal uh it&#39;s raining gold we&#39;re pulling out the buckets you do whatever you think makes sense uh so go through this with fine tooth comb if you own even one share of that and then PayPal opportunity of a lifetime here uh to take advantage and there was an interview with a guy named Crossroads and he&#39;s basically like he&#39;s just like a college student or PhD student he doesn&#39;t manage any money but he likes stocks and he uh got an interview with Alex Chris and it was a phenomenal interview the full 30 minutes you should listen to the full 30 minutes this is huge uh and we can&#39;t talk too much about the stock price and price AC action but it seems to me as an investor that there&#39;s a disconnect between what the market is seeing for PayPal and it&#39;s reflected in the price action versus the direction that you guys are clearly heading and so what do you think is the biggest factor that the market may be overlooking in PayPal right now [Music] um I have no idea you know I I came here I think the the stock was um significantly undervalued we&#39;re up 20% year-over-year and I think we&#39;re still dramatically undervalued um we we inflected uh a business that had been losing uh money for two years in a row and delivered you know if I&#39;d come to you a year ago and said you know how would you feel about 5% transaction margin 6% transaction margin in 24 I think pretty much everyone would have been like yeah there&#39;s no possible way you can do that and we delivered it um and then we put uh together you know again we&#39;re being prudent I I had a lot of conversations with investors when I got here and um a lot of the feedback was hey in the past the company had been really bullish on projections and then missed and that&#39;s just not my style that&#39;s not the mentality that we have and so we&#39;re going to tell you when we when we say something we&#39;ve got line of sight to it and we&#39;re going to go execute against it my guess is um there&#39;s been a lot of suffering in this stock in the last few years you just have to look at the chart and and understand that you know there was a Peak and then it fell and so we&#39;ve got a lot of investors both retail and and institutional that have lived through that and I think with a brand new leadership team coming in um we&#39;re in a bit of a waitand see mode and the best thing we can do is deliver for customers execute our plan provide you as much transparency as possible as to what we&#39;re doing and have a very high say do ratio um we beat every quarter that we told we were what we were going to do um abely I know everyone wants us to beat by even more and like all of that happens we also have to recognize that the Innovations we&#39;re putting out um take time right I this is just I&#39;ve worked in different businesses this just happens to be one where you know we are at a scale where when we put a merchant Innovation out like these new Innovations we have for for Branded checkout they are crushing it when you look at the conversion rate Improvement it just takes time to roll this out like we&#39;re talking about tens of Millions of merchants and even the largest Enterprise ones it just takes time to get into their ecosystem we make a consumer change we launch PayPal everywhere it takes time I mean the fact that we got three million new PayPal everywhere debit card users in the first you know quarter and a half is it&#39;s insanely fast it is and it&#39;s still not good enough right because because everyone wants more and so absolutely look I don&#39;t know how long it&#39;s going to take for folks to sort of say hey we&#39;re gonna we understand that this leadership team is delivering on their on their commitments um but if you&#39;re looking for you know everything to turn around in in two months this probably isn&#39;t the right stock for you uh this is this is a business that we are building a flywheel that becomes the leader in in Commerce for the next decade and Beyond and that may take a few quarters or a couple of years and I think we were uh again we put out some um I think pretty exciting uh goals at yesterday in terms of what we think our long-term um transaction margin and EPS growth will look like we wouldn&#39;t put those out if we didn&#39;t have L line ofite to if we didn&#39;t know that hey when we execute uh on these growth levers and we&#39;ve got lots of growth levers now uh when we execute on this we&#39;re going to deliver it so you know again apologies that this isn&#39;t a fast you know flip of the switch and all of a sudden everything turns around but 800 basis point Improvement in transaction margin in the first you know year is is pretty significant and uh I think we&#39;re just getting started yeah and the Topline numbers you know may not be what some people are expecting and hoping but the bottom line that&#39;s right I feel like PayPal has been lacking let&#39;s I mean let&#39;s talk about that so I got here and you know we had really good Revenue growth numbers right really good Revenue growth numbers empty calories right Revenue growth numbers with declining transaction margin so look it may be it may be uncomfortable and it may be the hard decisions but I&#39;m going to make the right decisions for the company for the long term and going back and having price to Value conversations I won&#39;t apologize for that I mean our our revenue is absolutely slowing for a period of time until we have these conversations but I can tell you the conversations we&#39;re having are incredible the conversations we&#39;re having with Merchants now to be able to price the value for them to be able to take all the different value added Services we&#39;re bringing together to now have conversations about ads we are having healthy relationships that are building the foundation for growth for the future so it is absolutely the right decision and we&#39;ve been as transparent as we can around hey revenue is going to come down for a couple of quarters and then we&#39;ll inflect and grow back but I would much rather rip the bandid off have the hard decisions and build this company for the long term then grab a couple more quarters of increasing empty calorie Revenue that&#39;s not delivering anything for the company for the long term but it looks really good and I I just don&#39;t want to do that I want to build this for the long term so if you&#39;re interested in in being with us for the longterm which I know you are uh then I think I think uh um this is the right place for you and and you know if you want a quarter of just you know Big Poppy\n\n Improvement in transaction margin in the first you know year is is pretty significant and uh I think

point being quote I fundamentally believe guest checkout is going to be a winner take all Market and the guest check checkout is the largest untapped opportunity there&#39;s also some talk about they

likes that part of our weekly show we're excited to cover that here so let's kick it off with Josh Jacobson thank you for the great work you do every week your consistency is on Match I want to get your opinion on Arista networks uh okay so he said valuation still looks a little Rich does it make sense to get into a great business even if the valuation is a little Rich no why would you get into where the valuation is Rich uh it's not the only stock in the market but let's see if that analysis is accurate uh I'm probably 90% chance I'm going to agree with you on that just pass wait till it comes to you and if it doesn't forget fomo or if it takes off without you so what uh this definitely looks like it's ready to bounce on a technical basis along with the mag 7 and many others so um if you're a Trader then you know have at it if you're an investor let's see what we're looking at here um here we go okay I forgot to turn this back that is default we like to zoom out here at hedge fund tips with Tom Hayes and not get caught up in the daily noise uh no way how's it save you time uh this is a stock that's up you know 30X in a handful of years it's got to rest this looks like a broken momentum stock and uh where you're going to get faked out is the fundamentals are going to come back down quicker well I mean this is this is kind of fascinating I I wouldn't be a buyer here I just just wait for a while and if you miss it you miss it um and I think you already know that so kudos to you from being a loyal listener not chasing shiny objects at the top and let other people be the bag holders on that JT investor could you shed some light on what caused vfc to drop this week uh the Market's going down people are overleveraged and they're getting smoked and nothing's changed in the fundamental uh plan and execution of Brack and Daryl um and uh and by the way if we zoom out I'll bet you can't even see it let's see VF Corp yeah so it's gone straight up for like three straight months it's going to correct and consolidate that's what they do that's what they do every single cycle straight up correct consolidate huge run straight up correct consolidate for here it was a year and then straight up so uh relax next Patrick B what's your take on the IT consulting service base I've never liked it uh gft Technologies and the reason I've never liked it is because your assets go down the elevator every day um so let's see gft Technologies um I you know I I don't like these businesses so I'm going to just pass Mark Callaway uh says hey Tom and thank you for all that you do not lip service truly thank you I know you say it's a great time to pick individual stocks but do you have a preferred ETF to put my adult kids in that are brand new to investing uh so many I've looked at are heavy on the mag 7 uh I would do a combination you know do some us vti is less concentrated in the uh mag 7 and then uh vxus uh xus it's a good place to start with those two if you just want to pass it for the long term maybe some Emerging Markets uh and maybe some small c cap so iwm would be small cap Emerging Markets would be uh vwo or um e and um that's opinion not advice but a great question thanks for listening iore Barry thoughts on Porsche uh we do not M we do not buy car makers we buy part suppliers Daniel Borman what is your th thought on Ray Doo's warning that a US debt crisis could trigger a heart attack in the next three years um let's see Ray Dio crash okay so he said uh three days ago we're going to crash he said let's see market crash basically every two years um look anyway the point is the guy made a lot of money and uh he's effectively a bond commodity guy by training and these guys are always negative and the beauty of that is they get a ton of money because t\n\nVF Corp yeah so it's gone straight up for like three straight months it's going to correct and consolidate that's what they do that's what they do every single cycle straight up correct

Daniel Borman what is your th thought on Ray Doo's warning that a US debt crisis could trigger a heart attack in the next three years um let's see Ray Dio crash okay so he said uh three days ago we're going to crash he said let's see market crash basically every two years um look anyway the point is the guy made a lot of money and uh he's effectively a bond commodity guy by training and these guys are always negative and the beauty of that is they get a ton of money because there is  more AUM in debt instruments than t\n\nhere is more AUM in debt instruments than there is in equity instruments. So, you know, that's just a function of the fact that rates have been so low for so long. And now that rates are starting to normalize, you're seeing some of that money come out of debt instruments and go into equity instruments. So, you know, that's just a function of the fact that rates have been so low for so long. And now that rates are starting to normalize, you're seeing some of that money come out of debt instruments and go into equity instruments.\n\nin credit because they don&#39;t want to take Equity risk and um and that&#39;s that so look uh if you Google you will see every two years he says the Market&#39;s going to crash and the fact of the matter is um he was right in 2008 and he made a ton of money and um and you really only have to be right once or twice in life to make a fortune whether that&#39;s in buying businesses building businesses picking a wife uh you don&#39;t have to be right a million times and uh nor should everyone anyone expect people to be right I mean at the end of the day the guy made 14 billion so so what if he made a few bad calls he made one or two right ones and uh and he made a fortune so I wouldn&#39;t worry about that uh he&#39;s going to be right again at some point I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s in three years or three months or or 20 years but um the message has been consistent let&#39;s just leave it at that Luca Milo thanks for the amazing content every week I share it with everyone that&#39;s interested in financial markets and they started following you too thank you very much uh what do you think leged plat uh it&#39;s a Furniture maker so it&#39;s going to be in the short term going to be hurt I think that uh it did have some balance sheet risk but uh you know it&#39;s in a big downtrend I mean the number one thing you need to do on this company is solvency risk but I think this could wind up being an interesting if not trade investment uh but this is the type of thing where i&#39; I&#39;d probably have to go understand the business really really carefully before so it looks like they&#39;ve got $350 million of cash and how much debt uh two billion so or 1.8 billion so you got to see when all that comes due uh you got to see what they&#39;re generating in terms of this is this is the issue uh let&#39;s see here cash from operations no cash from operations is not bad 305 million uh free cash flow 224 million so you just have to do the math [Music] on see cash from financing cash interest paid 84 million you just have to see when all these come to but I like the idea I definitely like the idea Luca and it&#39;s probably worth some more work ### ASK_ME_ANYTHING_QA\nokay we got that okay this one is from Grayson Harris what sort of path in the finance industry would you recommend college students who enjoy value investing what sort of firm environment would your college grad be able to prosper in a solid value investor without going off on their own number one you can&#39;t you can try to go off on your own but uh uh I I&#39;m going to repeat it I would never suggest taking other people&#39;s money to manage until you have proven that you don&#39;t need any money because you&#39;ve made enough money in markets for yourself and you&#39;ve gone through two or three Cycles working for someone else um and proven that you have lived through enough cycles and you know what you&#39;re doing before you take on that enormous responsibility um because if you do it wrong and you do it early you will not recover uh and um I I don&#39;t I don&#39;t even say that remotely lightly that&#39;s uh you know serious is a heart attack with that advice um and then what what skills do you hone through value investing that are transferable to other sectors I think it&#39;s you know the the language of numbers is critical for any and all businesses as a matter of fact uh I I think it&#39;s critical if you&#39;re in school and you can take accounting courses and you can take finance courses I would say that your odds of success in being an entrepreneur and starting a business are much higher than your odds of success in as an investor and the people who do investing well uh make it look a lot easier than it is because for every word that comes out of their mouth there&#39;s probably 75 thoughts and uh historical Frameworks that are running in in the background that you don&#39;t know and can&#39;t understand without living through 20 plus years of markets so um that&#39;s number one number two um it&#39;s a lot more competitive than you think uh you know you&#39;re going against the smartest you know smart quot smartest students in the world smartest you know people got the highest grades and all all of that stuff so it&#39;s not a walk in the park I mean I if you absolutely love it and it&#39;s what you do you know if you if you wound up at another job and like all night long all you&#39;re doing is studying stocks and you don&#39;t go to bed till you get to your job and like it&#39;s what you love then it&#39;s probably what you should do but if it&#39;s like oh that&#39;s where I should go to make money because I can make more money ah huge huge life mistake uh you won&#39;t be able to compete with people who love to do it 247 uh and you&#39;ll get you&#39;ll get smoked out um so my B best suggestion in your 20s is you don&#39;t have to be a genius you just have to be persistent and consistent and you could build a business that&#39;ll make you so much more money uh before you&#39;re 30 than you would ever make in the finance uh industry um but if you play the turtle hair game you know having the skill of being a a great investor uh when all is said and done by the time you&#39;re 50 uh you know the scales tip and and you got compounding in the rearview mirror and you might might wind up uh a lot further ahead but you really have to love it I would go to youtube.com under the hedge fund tips Channel and put in the search bar University of Bristol I did an hour interview with their investor Club on uh my suggestions if you do want to get into the business um it&#39;s a narrower opening than it was 20 years ago um when regulations were easy and anyone and their mother could start a hedge fund uh in the early 2000s and that all changed when the rules changed uh so it&#39;s a lot more expensive much higher barriers of Entry a lot fewer startups um but uh but also I like that because um it it creates a it creates a moat so uh or a small moat if you&#39;re really good at it and you love it uh so the short answer to your question is if you love it go for it you&#39;ll figure it out if you are just doing it because it looks like an easy way to make money uh absolutely do not go in this direction uh go build a business or or go work for someone first [Music] um I think there&#39;s so many unbelievable opportunities to make a ton of money as an entrepreneur nowadays with all the platforms available to you and all the ways to reach markets that have never existed if you have a good idea go for it and you may fail in two or three businesses in your 20s that&#39;s perfectly normal as an entrepreneur uh in finance you can&#39;t do that you can&#39;t blow up a fund and expect to ever come back I mean people do it but it&#39;s the exception not the rule so that&#39;s that you know on a business you can just rebound and do it again and do it again most entrepreneurs probably fail two or three times before they have their big big hit that would probably be an exciting way to live if if you don&#39;t know if you love investing uh but um but that&#39;s that uh Michael silver Tidewater I just go with Slumber Jay if you have to or um yeah this was obviously delution at some point I I I don&#39;t like that one even rig I don&#39;t like I I would just go up the food chain and go to something like SLB or HP or uh noov if you have to be in the space and you can&#39;t resist that that&#39;s probably more where I would be interested um but I don&#39;t have to so I won&#39;t uh moving on Christopher Williams block not interested we like PayPal I knew no David Martin Philip uh do you have a preference between Bungie or ADM uh I would go for Archer Daniels Midland RCI what is this thing is this a cable operator yeah Communications company wireless cable and media internet access I mean this is kind of like the Comcast story they all look interesting here um I think this probably could this will probably wind up working but uh I would definitely do some work on it here but if you&#39;re totally right you&#39;re going to get a double and I I don&#39;t think it&#39;s a good enough business to take that risk and I don&#39;t like I don&#39;t need to be totally right I like things that I can be half wrong and still make a triple in a few years so uh it&#39;s not for me Kyle Burns uh if you were the CEO of Advanced Auto Parts would you be doing something different than Chanel Kelly or do you feel that he&#39;s doing exact same way you would do things or is there room for improvement I I literally wouldn&#39;t change one thing that Shane o&#39; Kelly is doing as a matter of fact he&#39;s doing a better job than I would and that&#39;s why he&#39;s going to wind up with probably a triple if not more uh and that&#39;s why I just pick the jockeys versus having to implement the execution uh because I pick people who can do it better it&#39;s the same way it&#39;s the same reason that people are who are you know sentim Millionaires and billionaires pick me to manage their money it&#39;s not because they couldn&#39;t learn it and do it it&#39;s because they&#39;re already rich so they&#39;re going to delegate to someone who specialized that they don&#39;t do it all day for 20 years uh and just like I&#39;m going to delegate to Shane o Kelly who&#39;s been doing this stuff for three decades between Home Depot Supply and other successful runs uh and you can hear his whole interview and Brack and Daryl from Old Spice days to Logitech to Proctor and Gamble I mean these guys that&#39;s all they&#39;ve done for decades so I&#39;m going to delegate the execution to them because they&#39;re going to be the best out of it&#39;s not because you know Shane o Kelly is 10 IQ points higher than Tom Hayes therefore he&#39;s doing a better job it&#39;s because that&#39;s all he does uh and and and so on and so forth so the more successful people you meet the more you will realize that they delegate more than you would ever imagine doing you the things that you could do are different than the things you should do the good is the enemy the better is the enemy of the best if you are not doing your highest and best value and you&#39;re not delegate and you&#39;re not delegating you&#39;re doing a disservice to the world so I&#39;m at a stage now where I&#39;m delegating everything that&#39;s not picking stocks or interacting with clients the things that I do best uh everything else is has been effectively delegated now more or less I&#39;d say I&#39;m if I&#39;m not 80% there I&#39;m 80 90% there and all I have to think about nowadays is um picking stocks which is what I love to do which is my highest and best use because you you you don&#39;t outperform by consensus any of the best funds in the world it&#39;s one or two people and usually one person making all the decisions and then they have support staff to get everything else done and operations and excellence and all of that stuff um uh and by the way that was the case for for diio by the way uh and uh I know his number two extremely well played poker with him for 10 years and um they made effectively all the decisions even though they had a thousand people they had a thousand bodies why because when pensions come in to see you uh they have this metric and the more bodies you have in seats doing busy work the bigger the check they&#39;re allowed to write you so if you want you know $200 million from a pension fund you better have 50 people sitting in seats uh whether they&#39;re doing anything or not is immaterial uh it just it just pays to pay them a salary to sit there so you can get a bigger check from a pension I&#39;m not in that game I&#39;ve never optimized for maximum a I&#39;ve always optimized for quality of life doing what I love and making sure that every single partner I have every investor is someone that I enjoy respect and would hang out with whether or not we did business and if I meet that I live happy life they live a happy life everything&#39;s good and if I optimize for AUM and I start dealing with 12-year olds with clipboards counting the number bodies and seeds it takes me away from doing what I do best which is picking stocks so uh that&#39;s how I&#39;ve decided to live my life and it works great for me ### ASK_ME_ANYTHING_QA\num okay so uh David okay thoughts on docu or valet doy sign I I I don&#39;t really have an interest in this I I I don&#39;t all right let&#39;s try valet valet will probably work for a trade but I mean you&#39;re lucky to make a double if everything goes right so uh for me no but I think valy is ready to go Nick thank you for all your wisdom and help with things in stock market I&#39;m an avid listener every week over here in the UK want to ask your thought about Powell Industries uh okay P WL thank you by the way for all of the Avid listeners and particularly those folks uh no no this was a 20 bagger it&#39;s a broken momentum stock I don&#39;t want to buy it up here regardless of how good the fundamentals look now because the stock is telling me that the fundamentals are probably going to deteriorate pretty quickly so uh for me that&#39;s a pass ### ASK_ME_ANYTHING_QA\num David [Music] Gavin look at Denny&#39;s ah these are tough I mean we&#39;re over restaured here in the US all this is is a debt story let&#39;s take a look at the balance sheet here because question is is whether this thing why is the cash so low these numbers have to be wrong if these numbers are right Run for the hills I think these numbers are wrong says they got $3 million of cash and uh $261 million of debt um I don&#39;t know that that can be right let&#39;s see what their free cash flow is this this is this is not for me I mean it looks like it wants to bounce from a trading perspective for sure and it is a legacy brand but uh that&#39;s just going to go in my to Hard Box uh Alex CK Hutchinson Holdings Hong Kong I will not buy any Chinese stock other than Alibaba and if I had to buy one or two more it would be ba and 10 cent uh I I won&#39;t buy any midcaps or small caps I&#39;m not taking country and Company risk I mean our our original thesis with ba baba was if if uh if Baba goes down so does China I mean that&#39;s basically what it comes down to so uh I&#39;ve seen too many frauds in China over the years I&#39;ve seen people get burned by frauds in China every cycle I won&#39;t I mean no way I mean Alibaba has been stress tested over and over there are tons of outs I&#39;m not going to play in other stock so you know if you want a lagard in China because everything else has moved up if I had to take buy put a ton of new money to work in China and I didn&#39;t want to chase up baba uh I&#39;d probably start to take a hard look at Buu um and that&#39;ll be a a lower quality but catch up but as far as betting on like obscure stocks that I have no Edge uh hard pass because we&#39;re going to pull up the numbers they&#39;re going to look great and then there&#39;s a coin flip chance in nine months it turns out to be a fraud and there&#39;s nothing like uh you can do about it you have no Edge ### HEADLINES_AND_NEWS\nJames sent me a nice article in the Ft you can probably check out uh it says investors should be worry of analyst ratings you know and I make the joke of how Morgan Stanley downgraded China and Alibaba at $70 and now they&#39;re upgrading it at $140 so uh this article kind of embodies that and it&#39;s not just Morgan Stanley and it&#39;s not just China it happens over and over and over when the stock is down they all downgrade in the hole when the stock is up they all upgrade at the top uh and that&#39;s and that&#39;s the name of the game so analysts are now flipping on Baba because you know the price has doubled up plus uh but it&#39;s just the beginning they will start to come in herds and after it gets over 200 everyone will be upgrading and you know when it&#39;s beyond that you will see everyone uniformly uh bullish uh in the 200s with price targets over 300 and that&#39;s when you have to start to look carefully at fundamentals but we&#39;re nowhere near that point ### HEADLINES_AND_NEWS\nfour years this is from Matt in North Carolina four years of listening to the best content available on the

it's it's a rounding error and it's going to be passed through to the oems and then through the customers but also if interest rates go down and then you have tax deductibility on the auto loan uh that's a big deal that's a big deal\n### ASK_ME_ANYTHING_QA\nBill McGrew thanks for doing such a great podcast I never miss it wondering what your thought of APA a little cheaper than com stock on a Enterprise Value to free cash flow that is not a metric you would use for an energy company you're looking at proved and improved reserves value um I think it's uh I think apache's okay and I think that uh Comstock has more upside on a multiple basis so we're already at uh double and a half on uh 2 and a half X on comto resources I wouldn't bet on aache even being a double and I think Comstock is going to probably uh double again from here so that'll be like four 5x and um not will not be the case with Apache if you're lucky with aache you'll be up 50% so I would just uh leave it at that that's that's not the way you value this type of company but uh longtime listener can you look at halberton yeah I like halberton better than I like Tidewater um let's just put that in here but I think you you know I think you're taking some kind of risk for a maximum maximum double uh it's it's not that it's not terribly exciting for me but yeah if you want energy exposer it's probably okay uh okay statman emailed in from linta the wonderful high school that I had the pleasure to speak with a few weeks back uh nope that's not his let's see what note did he say no that's the old stuff okay well what he was saying was that his students were doing having a great time listening to it and I'm very grateful that they've stuck with it and I hope it makes a difference for a handful of

great Jimmy Jones when do you suspect ant group IPO uh probably in the next year would be my best guess if not sooner uh we own 35% of it so uh it probably adds initially 2030 billion and then over time probably 100 B billion dollars worth of value that&#39;s not in the stock uh David McLean Gregs g r e g GS uh that&#39;s interesting I think it&#39;s a fast food chain so cash flow has been deteriorating for two straight years while revenue&#39;s been going up margins are going down so just tell me how they&#39;re going to turn this around why are margins down uh how much is a stock down about 40% what&#39;s the balance sheet look like half a billion of leases let&#39;s cash look like what&#39;s the Share account doing looks like they&#39;re expanding they&#39;re probably investing in a lot of new stories is my guess uh where&#39;s the share count yeah I mean this thing looks at first blush is definitely worth more work I think you&#39;re probably okay here or near here uh you know 1500 I&#39;d be probably a lot more interested, 1600 but I I think if you&#39;re longterm you&#39;re probably going to be okay but I don&#39;t know the business so you got to really understand the business like is there something wrong with the business has it fallen out of fashion or is it just a normal cyclical trough um what is it Gregs food on the go retailer in the UK Kingdom you United Kingdom let&#39;s see what they sell okay accept all cookies Craigs nation&#39;s favorite sausage roll uh oh it&#39;s like a fast casual yeah I mean the numbers look okay I I don&#39;t really have an edge here but it generally spes the smell test and would be warranted to do a lot more work before making a material position but uh I you know it&#39;s if you&#39;re 100% right you you have probably a maximum of a double and it&#39;s going to take you a few years which is okay uh hi Tom I&#39;m following this is from uh Pete B bastarts I&#39;m following your show for two years and really like your style and expertise in my quest to educate myself in the investing space your podcast as much watch weekly and by the way you&#39;re the number one reference I share with friends and family because of the unique macro and micro combo could you take a look at umore EUR European material stock uh just wrote off the battery recycling okay yeah the question is whether they fired the CEO who made that decision that&#39;s that&#39;s the key if it&#39;s the same idiot running it uh that&#39;s not ideal to make a enormous bet on battery recycling just tells me that there&#39;s a screw missing in his head so uh umor yeah I mean this is down a lot my guess is the balance Sheet&#39;s going to be looking shaky here no two billion of cash 2.4 billion of debt what&#39;s going on with uh free cash flow investing yeah balance sheet it&#39;s good income statement this is a pretty big drop off revenues have cut in half all right so they made a bet precious metals business minting cash also various other units God I I just want to know how are these revenues going to stabilize um balance sheet looks okay but you got to look and see when does all that debt mature this thing is a falling knife but uh you could have an opportunity there I would really love to see this CEO fired who made an all-in bet on battery recycling oh excuse me former CEO I think he might have some I think this is worth looking into uh good work so I&#39;m going to write that one down yumore all right good work uh and I think I think well s sorry statman I don&#39;t have let&#39;s see CU he sent it to my great Hill Capital email and you got it when you&#39;re trying to get something on the\n\n### ASK_ME_ANYTHING_QA\nto do a lot more work before making a material position but uh I you know

tips.com and click on contact do not okay all right so okay so here&#39;s what cork says uh my kids are having more fun and more and the conversations are better than ever with their stock market game fictitious 10K to start the game ever since you came to lint High School Alibaba is a daily conversation and the kids are generally asking better and more insightful\n\n### ASK_ME_ANYTHING_QA\nquestions than they had in the past stats is always a lively subject anyway uh but you have added to the circus that my classes are in a fun way keep up the great work all right cork well you keep up the great work uh hello to all the students at linta High School uh out here in Orange County and uh very very glad to hear that made a difference all right so let&#39;s see if we have one more uh Alibaba is a daily conversation and the kids are generally asking better and more insightful\n\n### ASK_ME_ANYTHING_QA\nquestion and then we&#39;ll call it a day uh Akamai AK k a m this is from Oz SMA [Music] yeah I mean I think this is going to be one of those where you got to be 100% right to make a 50% return and I I just think that I I like this I I just go for softballs down the middle where I can be half wrong and still make a triple uh these type of things you&#39;re just you&#39;re you&#39;re getting in front of Steamrollers for pennies uh I think you&#39;re going to be fine with this but it&#39;s not something that I would take uh great free cash flow it&#39;s okay I mean I it&#39;s not a great business let me see the balance sheet real quick looks okay two billion two billion income statement yeah it&#39;s okay it&#39;s not something I would do though I need doubles and triples to get interested I don&#39;t think you&#39;re going to get it with Emi uh Dan flicker Tom thank you so much for the value that you provide I&#39;ll continue to spread the word about the incredible podcast thank you Daniel that&#39;s the number one way to pay back uh wondering what your framework is with broken momentum stocks take Celsius for example what are you looking for in a bottom process\n\n### FEATURED_COMPANY_DEEP_DIVES\nrebuild a shareholder base um this one is interesting though so uh I think it just got to be super patient I think this one might be actually okay here we've looked at it a number of times I hate to even take the time to do it I I think this one's generally going to be okay but you just you have to do a lot of work you got to understand like what why first off you need to understand the short story why is it down so much uh and what's the story is it the stuff in it makes you sick or is it something else and what are they doing to resolve and alleviate that what's happening with volumes and why did they have to buy Acquisitions to reignite growth versus continue to grow organically did they stall um but I think the balance is probably okay here uh liability long-term debt looks good let's take a look at income statement uh 1.3 billion so they're kind of stalling I mean this is the problem they were doubling every year and then they stalled out um and sometimes they stall out before they declin sometimes they stall out before they re accelerate so you got to be clear on the international story why are they stalling is it is the market limit or did they was it a fad or is it durable like monster beverage was one of the greatest stocks of all time Hansen uh and uh what are we doing with the share count here they're adding a lot of shares man I don't like that uh this one's definitely worth doing more work on because I do think you can get a doubler triple if you're right um so I'll write that one down again just it's it's very hard to have an edge because you're kind of predicting the future of consumer fads because it's not not been around long enough and there it's a very crowded space unlike when monster beverage came to Market unlike when Red Bull came to Market that doesn't mean it can't be done just uh it's not a guarantee okay and I think we have nailed it and we've done all of the questions  so",

    "MEDIA_APPEARANCE_RECAP": "\n\n### MEDIA_APPEARANCE_RECAP\nwe had that huge flush on Tuesday and I said we are a buyer today in the hole and then sure enough we got a massive rebound on Wednesday uh a retest today Fridays and Mondays have been weak all year so but I do think we&#39;re going to get that turnaround and I do think we&#39;re going to be a lot higher two weeks out so time will tell but here it is let&#39;s see how it plays out tune in here now the m is in correction territory and as of now the Dow is negative for the year Market Watcher Tom Hayes joins me on the phone here&#39;s the negatives we&#39; we got tariffs imposed we&#39;ve got a trade War we&#39;ve got inflation that&#39;s still not beaten and you know there&#39;s other things going wrong as well what&#39;s the is and the Market&#39;s way way down is this a buying opportunity right now Tom unquestionably Stu this is the buying opportunity of the first quarter uh you know we need to step back and keep in mind that tariffs were raised almost every single year following the Spanish Flu in 19 18 all the way up to 1929 before Smoot Holly we are nowhere near those tariff levels that&#39;s number one number two Commerce Secretary Howard lutnick has emphasized these tariffs are fentol related which means t\n\nwhat&#39;s your thoughts on the fed&#39;s next move I think Jerome Powell is the Rodney danger field of Finance he gets absolutely no respect and rightfully so CU he&#39;s screwed the pooch on the front side of predicting inflation but what do you think his next move is in light of all the market conditions well it&#39;s interesting looking at today the odds of a June cut just went up to 85% uh you know we talk about all these things that none of which were on people&#39;s Bingo cards at the turn of the year whether it&#39;s International outperformance whether it&#39;s dollar weakening whether it&#39;s yields compressing or whether it&#39;s the FED now cutting which you know just a few weeks ago everyone saying no Cuts in 2025 we&#39;re g to get two cuts at least one to two c so you think two I I&#39;ve been on the record saying it&#39;s maybe one maybe none uh that was a couple weeks ago for me the big sticking points were the categories of inflation that were were stubbornly high so food shelter and energy those are not things you can quickly correct so my thesis has been that look we&#39;re going to get stubbornly higher inflation stuck in the three and a half range and because of that that you know Pal&#39;s going to have to wait but you think possibly two cuts which at the end of the way that fed put&#39;s going to be worth while for stock investors so it&#39;s a net positive for us exactly the more you know look last thing I just want to say keep an eye on the 10year jgb yields this is the most important chart that no one else is paying attention to uh those are climbing because the bank of Japan has to hike to quell inflation which is growing after 10 you know 20 years of printing money crazy right like never ever do we think we would be in the situation in Japan with them coming off zero if you you look at the last Peak was late July before you had that mag seven scare in early August yeah a lot of hot money has come into the mag7 which is a very crowded trade it&#39;s getting it&#39;s starting to uncrowded to quell inflation the more hot money is going to come out of Mag s so that&#39;s why the opportunities in UNM mag 493 small caps International Etc does doesn&#39;t mean you have to get out of these great businesses it just means uh more moderation and I think that&#39;s the going to be a theme in opportunity in 2025 for sure\n### MEDIA_APPEARANCE_RECAP\nand I want to reemphasize something that is critically important that I covered with Lou and that is uh the most important chart that no one is paying attention to uh and I posted this on Twitter so you can see it here uh this is the uh Japanese 10-year bond yield at 152 and I found it comical all day uh every single major commentator was blaming Tech being down 3% on tariffs which has nothing to do with it whatsoever and what what we really have happening and you&#39;re seeing it as the 10-year yield has been going down one thing that people haven&#39;t been paying attention to is European bond yields blowing out and more importantly the Japanese 10-year yield this is the key to the markets continues to go up and what that means is the carry trade is unwinding as the boj has to now raise rates to fight off inflation from 20 continuous years of printing money um uh the free money is drying up and a lot of that hot free money that they were able to borrow in Yen for free and buy Mag 7 the most crowded trade in the world is now evaporating as capital has a cost it&#39;s coming out of the overvalued pockets of the market and finding undervalued pockets of the market like China uh you know whether it&#39;s Baba up 65% year-to date whether it&#39;s kweb up uh 25% Europe up 15% Etc um uh that Trend will continue that said it would not Shock me to see a bounce in the mag 7 what we said for 2025 was that mag 7 would underperform index us index returns would be subdued because mag 7 is such an incredibly High weight uh and for you know a huge opportunity under the surface in UNM magnificent 493 but much more so in international and also believe uh on the Tailwind is going to be small cap you got to pay attention to that but amazing mag s down 7.7% uh and um so keep an eye as long as that those jgb yields keep going up you&#39;re going to see continued pressure on mag 7 I think we&#39;re due for a technical bounce here on mag s they could even go as high as the top of their recent range I wouldn&#39;t bet on it but it wouldn&#39;t surprise me um uh and then we&#39;re going to get through that period of seasonality that we&#39;ve discussed in many uh of the last podcast where February and the first two weeks of March in a postelection year is very weak and then you get a monstrous uh uh uh kind of rally in late March all the way through May June uh and I that would not surprise me whatsoever earnings growth coming in at 18.2% this quarter keeping Ane on GDP down uh GDP now is estimated to come in at negative -2.4 the other thing that few people are paying attention to is now uh uh fed fund Futures 85% chance of a cut in June which is why I was uh leaning with L to one to two cuts um and uh 10year yield and and US dollar continues to fall which favors International then I had the pleasure to join uh Kai Hoffman on sore financially for his podcast uh a few days back and we&#39;re going to listen in here every single dip in Alibaba we bought because it was the cheapest amount of value for the highest earnings growth and upside opportunity and uh when it turns it turns all at once and you know yeah 60% in a few weeks but it&#39;s early days for the China trade for years uh politicians have been substantiating their existence by creating more and more regulation putting more and more Governors against growth uh and um and Trump is throwing that playbook [Music] out hello and welcome to sore financially a channel where we discuss the macro to understand the micro my name is Kai Hoffman I&#39;m the Ed Jr mining guy over on X and of course I&#39;m your host of this Channel and I&#39;m looking forward to welcoming a First Time guest to the program it&#39;s Tom Hayes he&#39;s the chairman of great Hill capital and I&#39;m really looking forward to discussing with him like the General Market Outlook and the state of the economy uh I know he&#39;s strong on the AI side and he&#39;s brought us or he&#39;s bringing us some ideas on where to invest over 2025 what is he looking at and what are some of the ideas that he&#39;s following really looking forward to this discussion um before I switch over to my guest please be reminded to hit that like And subscribe button helps us out tremendously we much appreciate it and thank you for it so Tom it is great to have you on the program it&#39;s good to see you thank you so much for joining us thanks for having me Kai glad to be here yeah really looking forward to this a bit of a different perspective on what we usually talk about so we&#39;re we&#39;re really going to keep it mainstream almost like it&#39;s called mainstream because we were just chatting and you said oh you&#39;re gold Focus Channel I was like yeah but we&#39;re trying to widen the audience a little bit and just cover topics that a I&#39;m maybe personally not as strong in but also interested is just the general markets and you touched on a couple topics Emerging Markets small cap indices like really looking forward to learning more about that Tom um but before we get to that we we really got to start at a high level I&#39;m going to ask you since you&#39;re a First Time guest on the program like what&#39;s your current assessment of the economy and the financial markets I think on balance the economy is strong earnings are very strong we just got through earning season for Q4 the the bulk of it is done uh 16.9% earnings growth which is phenomenal uh that&#39;s the good news the bad news is guidance has been a little weaker than expected and S&amp;P earnings have come down expectations for this year from you know 275 for the S&amp;P down to like below 270 some shops are at 268 uh but it&#39;s not terribly concerning because this is the part of the year that I like to refer to as sandbagger season meaning uh seasonally uh CEOs tend to take down guidance in the first quarter to set expectations low so they can beat for the subsequent three quarters and I think that that will be no different this year it&#39;s where we are we&#39;re in the normal late February volatility chop uh that we see not only most years as February is the second worst month of the year but we see in a pronounced way postelection years on average since 1950 the S&amp;P is down 1.3% in February so here we are uh you know a handful of more days and then we&#39;ll probably start to find a bid on some some of the stocks that have been hammered oh absolutely no it&#39;s a you know seasonality is a big factor we we can get to that but uh I I got a burning question here like 16.9% earnings like growth where does it come from yeah it&#39;s it&#39;s been pretty broad you know the the whole theme for 2025 that we&#39;ve been talking about for you know a number of months on our our podcast and our public appearances has been the mag mag Magnificent Seven earnings that drove the bus in 2024 uh is De decelerating dramatically in 2025 so you had magnificent s grow earnings in 2024 at about 33% and what outperformed in 2024 magnificent 7 it&#39;s not a mystery uh the problem is and the dichotomy in the market is this year earning growth for the mag 7 are going to decelerate from 33% down to now it&#39;s about 16% almost half and the real problem is the multiples have not compressed commensurate with the D celeration in earnings growth so multiples have stayed up they&#39;re starting to come in a little bit but you know if you look at the rest of the market their earnings growth is going to accelerate from you know uh 3 3 4% last year to you know 13 14 15% and the multiple is a lot lower maybe 16 17 times 18 times versus the MA 7 at 33 times so I think people are figuring this out and they&#39;re reallocating which is why the mag 7 is down over one and a half% year to date while uh the S&amp;P is up to and change uh and some of the laggards from last year like materials and healthc Care are up you know five six seven percent year-to dat let&#39;s break that down even more so you&#39;re you&#39;re talking materials is growing there must be some consumer confidence and uh perfect topic for today cuz I wrote down consumer confidence missed expectations like yeah how does that fit together like when you see materials meanings like okay I can spend money on Home Improvement and other things I hope I&#39;m interpreting this right uh Tom but like where&#39;s that confidence coming from that we&#39;re not seeing in the numbers yeah so the consumer confidence is largely a function of a number of things uh number one is tariff fears people have uh been fed this narrative that tariffs will lead to sustainable inflation uh history doesn&#39;t bear that out it&#39;s a one time so let&#39;s say hypothetically all the tariffs that are promised go into place and it&#39;s 25% it&#39;s a one-time bump it&#39;s not 25% compounded at 3% per year uh and that&#39;s not that&#39;s not the way it works so what you find as you saw in 2018 with washing machines you get a short-term bump in price you look intermediate term a year later uh they&#39;re kind of kind of flat and then you know two years out they&#39;re actually down uh so people are are worried about the uncertainty of tariffs they&#39;re worried a little bit about inflation which by the way this time of year the January reports and the February reports tend to come in a little hotter seasonally so you know the last inflation reports were a little concerning for people but that is normal for this time of the year uh and I think a lot of this will be put behind us that said uh are people reallocating to where they can get more more earnings growth for a lower multiple you bet and we&#39;re seeing the move in particular into International stocks which are dramatically outperforming uh you know S&amp;P up two in change European equities up 10% that was on no one&#39;s Bingo cards coming into the year and emerging markets in China Emerging Markets up 7 and a half percent and China absolutely flying China Tech uh and that&#39;s our largest position and we&#39;ve been building that you know it&#39;s not like we just picked it five weeks and it went straight up I mean we&#39;ve been building that position for two years every single dip in Alibaba we bought because it was the cheapest amount of value for the highest earnings growth and upside opportunity and uh when it turns it turns all at once and you know yeah 60% in a few weeks but it&#39;s early days for the China trade very early days it&#39;s as as things seem to be calming down uh towards or like to the aggression towards China seems to be calming down a little bit I don&#39;t know that&#39;s again got feeling that&#39;s what I&#39;m sensing and you&#39;re sort of confirming it I I want to get to Alibaba L when we talk more tech stocks and like investment ideas um I want to stay on the fundamentals for now and I know we&#39;re going to get a lot of flak and people turning off when you said the economy is strong because my audience believes the economy is weak it&#39;s weakening um and there are definitely cracks in the system um visible and it seems like there&#39;s a bit of a uh discrepancy uh there was an article in the Wall Street Journal that I discussed with another guest the other day where like 10% of the spending or sorry the 10% are doing most of the spending while 90% the spending is going down dramatically um if I if I find it I&#39;ll bring it up in a second but I&#39;m curious like how where break that down like the economy is strong like what what do you base yeah so look I mean you had uh two recessions in two years in 2020 during covid you had two negative quarters of GDP growth or lack thereof and you in 2022 they never called it a recession but you had two quarters of NE consecutive quarters of negative GDP growth right now our GDP growth depending what trackers you look at but let&#39;s just say Atlanta fed GDP now is at 2.3% Goldman&#39;s a little more bearish at 1.9% you don&#39;t get a recession with positive GDP okay so whether it comes in at one and a half or two and a half it&#39;s really IMM material the key is it&#39;s growing despite the headwinds now to your point are people at the lower end of the economic spectrum uh struggling a little bit yes we we see all the data we&#39;re not blind to the default rate going up on credit cards a little bit on auto loans uh and and the like you&#39;ve had rates go up dramatically and you&#39;ve had people that became accustomed that weren&#39;t accustomed to being able to spend a lot of discretionary money that were you know force-fed checks from the government and got used to spending and eating out and doing all those things so when the money dried up they kept it going on their credit card so yeah there&#39;s going to be some pain at the low end but that you know that&#39;s that&#39;s been the bell curve since day one and uh not only did the top 10% uh percent make up you know 50% or more of the spending uh they pay a ton of the taxes so it&#39;s always been that way it&#39;s probably going to be that way but what I will say is that in Trump 1.0 uh the lower and middle class did a lot better than they did under Biden and they were really starting in terms of employment rates among minorities in terms of real wages increasing uh in terms of all that that group did the best and I think that&#39;s going to be the case in Trump 2.0 so if the cost of that is a little volatility in the US indices and for those of you who are in exclusively passive indexing in the S&amp;P 500 you&#39;re going to feel it because the mag 7 is you know 35% weight of that and their earnings are decelerating their capex is going up their margins are going to uh start to feel that if if they don&#39;t get the return which I don&#39;t think anyone expects in the next three to four quarters to see a return on the $300 billion doll of AI investment uh and um and you just have to adjust but on balance I think as we get through the fear of the tar tariffs and the reality or lack thereof of the tariffs uh I think you&#39;re going to find that uh doge is very efficient in cutting costs which is deflationary that is going to offset a lot of the fears around inflation and the 10-year yield is telling you exactly that&#39;s going to happen which is why you saw in the last few quarters couple of quarters uh that hedge funds were the most short the 10year treasury than they&#39;ve been since late 2018 and that was the period that preceded one of the biggest Bond rallies in the shortest period of time yields compressed I think we&#39;re going to see the exact same thing the smart Money commercials are short are long bonds uh very long Bonds longest since 2018 and that&#39;s why you&#39;re seeing the 10-year get bid yields are starting to compress the exact opposite of what everyone was calling for a few weeks ago when the 10e yield was at 480 and everyone said it was going to five and we were out publicly and said nope it&#39;s going to four I think we&#39;re going to four and we may not even stop at four we&#39;re going to see a three handle which is going to shock a lot of people and that is going to Spur a level of growth not in mag 7even but in things like Auto industry in things like homeb building which has gotten left for dead in things like homeb building suppliers uh tool producers like Stanley Black and&amp; Decker which is one of our our positions like JRA which has 75% of the home standby generator this is the kind of stuff that&#39;s not sexy today because everyone wants to chase what&#39;s up the shiny objects and they&#39;re getting their heads handed to them but it&#39;s going to be sexy 6 n months from now when everyone is getting excited about DeWalt construction tools mark my words uh that will be a funny day and maybe I&#39;ll be back to celebrate a little bit of that with you doesn&#39;t doesn&#39;t S you know it it reminds me an awful lot of when everyone was pounding the table that China was uninvestable and we were pounding the table to buy it you know backing up the truck in the 60s when Morgan Stanley was downgrading in the hole and maybe you saw it this week up 100% from there and uh now they&#39;re upgrading China stocks I mean you can&#39;t make this stuff up no clear direction to be quite honest bit flip-flopping in the wind\n### MISCELLANEOUS\nI just quickly want to share that chart with you that that I found and uh you know the US consumer is is really really hurting just looking at cumulative excess savings that&#39;s from the article I mentioned and I&#39;m not sure if you can see that Tom but uh top 10% of earners roughly savings 1.3 trillion the other 90% of earners only have $291 billion saved anymore we all know that the US consumer is not a really a big saver savings rate in the US is 3.8% but we&#39;re trending toward zero here you know and the question is like when do we hit the panic button when are we in like fullon Eco trouble mode um you know right now everything seems fine I do agree like the numbers are not lying yes there&#39;s a Divergence and we&#39;re seeing trouble ahead and everybody feels it differently a little bit depending as this shows like what income level you&#39;re in um right now as well like the disparity is just getting bigger the question is like when are we going to see and I&#39;m like purposely overstating it but when are we going to see like riots in the streets yeah never not not anytime soon I mean the Chinese were the closest to having riots in the street and that&#39;s why they went from you know hunting down out you know Jack ma to wanting to basically put him in PR prison two years ago to now inviting him to meet with xinping and shaking his hand and giving him an award at the most recent uh CEO conference in China so uh I&#39;d be more worried about the risk she really push pushed it up to the edge he had 20% of 25 year olds with education unemployed that&#39;s that&#39;s a formula for a tan square and he was able to Pivot just in time because you saw the the protesting increasing around the country and now he&#39;s flipped everyone&#39;s got says okay the guy had a huge tolerance for pain he&#39;s flipped the switch and now we&#39;re back off to the races in China so so that&#39;s in the rearview mirror now what you&#39;re what you&#39;re blinded not you but the person who uh constructed this chart and article are blinded by is the fact that this is no different than anytime else what they&#39;re comparing it to is a one once in 100y year aberation when the government decided to pump the money pump the economy full of s trillion dollars and put it in the hands of people who historically are not Savers and uh and they&#39;ve proven to the point that they&#39;re still not Savers because they spent it as fast as they could now that it&#39;s running out they&#39;re going back to their normal savings level pre pandemic which was effectively zero and that&#39;s the way it&#39;s always been and uh it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s just you know it&#39;s not a commentary good or bad it&#39;s just the way it is uh as far as whether they&#39;ll they&#39;ll uh they&#39;ll be discontent related to that I think that uh you&#39;re going to see an acceleration of real wages and growth in the economy uh and productivity like you saw in Trump 1.0 in Trump 2.0 in coming quarters and they will be the primary beneficiary so while they&#39;re not saving I think you&#39;re going to see their wages continue to creep up uh and um and and uh but but as far as them Having excess savings the last five years was the exception not the rule yeah no absolutely because we gave them free money like corre that uh like to to quote somebody like somebody&#39;s probably I think Adam tager mentions that a lot like the pick is through the python like I think the pick has been digested almost and uh excrement it I don&#39;t know like correct and look you&#39;ll have credit card defaults that level I mean that&#39;s that&#39;s nothing new it h it happens every single cycle but if you look at high yield credit spreads which is what I pay attention to if you want to worry about if the world is coming to an end worry about high yield credit spreads and right now they&#39;re telling you uh all is Quiet on the Western Front it could change tomorrow but for now it&#39;s in good stead and if companies can refinance their debt and they can hit the capital markets all is well talk about inflation and wage growth I think that&#39;s an interesting combination I how worried are you about inflation in general and wage growth is roughly at 5.7% as we&#39;re you know I checked last week it might be different now but roughly around 5.7% like how how does that fit together are you worried about that is that too too much like how does that fit together yeah I mean look uh Elon Musk is basically firing anyone with a pulse that&#39;s willing to leave uh in the in the public sector I think it&#39;s you know probably in some sense maybe they&#39;ll overshoot and have to rehire some people but in some sense it&#39;s long overdue the issue is going to be uh whether or not the bulk of the people who have had jobs in the public sector uh will or will not be absorbed by the private SE sector I.E does their skill set translate to Value ad which is required in the private sector and the answer is we don&#39;t know yet so I think what you&#39;re going to see is a tick up in the unemployment rate uh which will be offsetting the inflationary Tendencies you&#39;re going to see deflation from the decreased government spending you&#39;re going to see inflation from some of the other parts of the economy um you know rents are still elevated uh housing is still elevated but what as bessent and Trump execute on their plan to bring the 10e yield down why would they focus on that versus the short end of the curve they focus on that because all mortgages are priced off of that all long-term loans are priced off of that and their ability to refinance the US debt is priced off of that and\n\n### MEDIA_APPEARANCE_RECAP\nfinally\n\n###

    "MACRO_DATA_SLIDES": "\n\nand I said we are a buyer today in the hole and then sure enough we got a massive rebound on Wednesday uh a retest today Fridays and Mondays have been weak all year so but I do think we&#39;re going to get that turnaround and I do think we&#39;re going to be a lot higher two weeks out so time will tell but here it is let&#39;s see how it plays out tune in here now the m is in correction territory and as of now the Dow is negative for the year Market Watcher Tom Hayes joins me on the phone here&#39;s the negatives we&#39; we got tariffs imposed we&#39;ve got a trade War we&#39;ve got inflation that&#39;s still not beaten and you know there&#39;s other things going wrong as well what&#39;s the is and the Market&#39;s way way down is this a buying opportunity right now Tom unquestionably Stu this is the buying opportunity of the first quarter uh you know we need to step back and keep in mind that tariffs were raised almost every single year following the Spanish Flu in 19 18 all the way up to 1929 before Smoot Holly we are nowhere near those tariff levels that&#39;s number one number two Commerce Secretary Howard lutnick has emphasized these tariffs are fentol related which means t\n### MACRO_DATA_SLIDES\nhere is  a way out you stop the fentol we will consider stopping the tariffs uh that is a huge factor and I&#39;m going to go out on a limb here I&#39;m going to tell you stu markets are going to be much higher two weeks from now than they are right now I&#39;m looking at a bunch of technical indicators which I don&#39;t spend a lot of time on you know I&#39;m a fundamental analyst we are close to washed out across the board so we are going to be in the market shopping today and this afternoon and maybe tomorrow as well but most likely today we will be putting on materially sized positions all right cleancut decision from Tom Hayes thanks for joining us Tom we appreciate you jumping in here thanks very much indeed for having me still sure thank coming up and we&#39;re back and then I had the pleasure to join my friend Lou bassan you know him from vne and Co you know him from uh mornings with Maria you know him from Cavuto we used to do uh the same show and you know from the big money show on Fox Business he is doing his own live podcast show called The Big Skinny and I had the privilege to join him on his first episode it was great uh you can follow him on Twitter at L Bassin uh he was an investment banker uh now he is an executive with an oil and gas rollup which is pretty exciting and then also doing his show The Big Skinny you could also join his uh email list the Big Skinny with Lou basanes the big skinny.com uh and uh he does a lot of creative companies like disruptive technology and all kinds of small cap stuff he had a CEO from an electronic devices small electronic devices company on be in the a block before my segment\n\n### MACRO_DATA_SLIDES\nlook at high yield credit spreads which is what I pay attention to if you want to worry about if the world is coming to an end worry about high yield credit spreads and right now they&#39;re telling you uh all is Quiet on the Western Front it could change tomorrow but for now it&#39;s in good stead and if companies can refinance their debt and they can hit the capital markets all is well talk about inflation and wage growth I think that&#39;s an

that because all mortgages are priced off of that all long-term loans are priced off of that and their ability to refinance the US debt is priced off of that and finally\n\n### MACRO_DATA_SLIDES\nexpectations for a Fed cut coming in earlier than June and if it's really bad this month is on the table for the FED not probabilistic but from a nonp possibility to a possibility that's going to impact interest rates which is going to impact car loans which is going to impact mortgages which is going to impact the ability for the US to refinance boatloads of debt at lower rates uh some of this uh chaos may be less by accident and more by Design than originally thought so what are we keeping our eyes on Japanese government bond yields followed by European bond yields pay close attention because if those blow out number one you're going to have the ECB cutting okay so that's stimulative that already number two you have uncertainty like 2011 because they have high debt to GDP and they still uh the structurally set up in a very fragile way the way that they are unable to uh issue Bonds in the same way that the us can um creates complications so we saw that in 2011 if fear about that shows up then there will be a further and stronger bid into us treasuries and that's potentially where we get the three handle on the 10year which again no one's bingo card except the incredible amazing listeners of hedge fun tips with Tom Hayes so uh you see this stuff lots of bears for stocks near new high okay this is Market concentration as it's ever been share of the top five companies by market cap in the S&P 500 so look these are historically unsustainable and all that means is it's going to be a rotation out of what's concentrated and into what's unconcentrated and that doesn't necessarily uh imply a crash uh of the indices it can be a a rotation with those stalling out and others picking up as their earnings growth accelerates and as the concentrated numbers decelerate so theme over and over now playing out in real time um most of the world is is surprised and no one\n\n### MACRO_DATA_SLIDES\ninitial jobless claims in Washington DC Skyrocket that&#39;s why this if this job Department if this jobs report comes in Weak it&#39;s going to be very constructive from a market standpoint because it brings the FED back into play much sooner than ever you know just a few weeks ago everyone saiding no Cuts because of the CPI report CPI is seasonally strong in January and February uh so that&#39;s a fake out and now we get to see what&#39;s under the surface and we also got to keep a strong eye on this GDP now at negative - 2.4% for q1 that&#39;s a big deal fortunately the GDP now has been wrong of late but you know two quarters is a is a recession and I think that that is low probability right now with 18% earnings growth and I think the numbers of uh uh at ATA fed are probably wrong again but you have to pay attention and keep keep your biases aside and deal with the facts and so far credit spreads are saying uh their numbers are probably wrong uh us initial jobless claims hit highest okay DC we got that bond yields going down we&#39;ve been expecting that that&#39;s happened uh cap backs we&#39;ve covered pening holds uh inflows into Europe everyone&#39;s chasing up so maybe we&#39;ll have some problems with the European bonds and that&#39;ll shake up their market and we&#39;ll see some flows we&#39;ll we&#39ll we&#39ll pay attention to that record outflow from crypto so a lot of um a lot of risk on stuff showing some some fear uh here&#39;s Seth golden with the a aii bull bear spread you can see uh when it gets this extreme um you know year out 6 months out on average you&#39;re up 133% 20 uh a year later you&#39;re up 22% this is international stocks second best month versus US stocks in the last 15 years by the way 15 years every 10 to 15 years it&#39;s it flips from us to International doesn&#39;t mean the international that us does bad it just means International does better what else we got here big rotation from mag 7 to China battic we talked about this tremendous 10 these are going straight up those are coming down they&#39;re going to meet in the middle and then China&#39;s going to exceed it just like China dramatically outperformed and then they caught caught up and one caught up and one caught down we&#39;re going to see mag 7 catch down and Chinese stocks catch up led by which Ali effen Baba bull markets last longer than you think we&#39;re only at 60 the average is 67 months we are only at 28 months so we&#39;re halfway there uh Living on a Prayer and uh there we go uh Europe stocks breaking out this looks pretty healthy even if you get a pullback uh probably a deal with zalinski is what uh what&#39;s what set what sets that up number of unsold completed homes for sale eye on the housing markets you&#39;re seeing a lot of weakness in Florida houses inventory is super high prices being cut 10 20% that is often a precursor for other frothy areas around the country uh so we&#39;ll keep an eye out on that and I will have a front row seat in Orange County we shall see as the chin marginal CH uh Chinese dollar stops flowing in because fomo is happening in China with everything starting to go up um you know maybe we will see some some opportunities abound uh here as well big Tech big decline we got that um this is another analog for the first year of the presidential cycle again some weakness in late February through mid-march and then straight up into summer so there&#39;s the dollar Index just rolling over uh what else do we have here that the Atlanta fed GDP keeping an eye on that Euro Zone loans to households so credit expansion is starting to happen in Europe to businesses as well PMI manufacturing back in expansion in China mag 7 so again I think we&#39;re back down here probably get a technical bounce here so for those of you who really like those stocks probably get a little bit of bargain for us the margin of safety even at these discounted levels is not where we want to see it but they definitely will probably work as a trade for many of you that like to do that stuff it&#39;s not what we do uh let&#39;s see S&P companies outperforming year on year uh this type of acceleration of breath uh is is um is very healthy and it&#39;s actually what we saw in when 2001 when small cap value and international dramatically outperformed even though there was some weakness short-term weakness in the economy and Tech got smashed ### HEADLINES_AND_NEWS\nother periods where you saw this was the second term of trump where well again a second term of Reagan where again International outperformed domestic as we saw the chart earlier Friday&#39;s advancing volume second highest since uh covid 202&#39;s Market recovery interesting uh uh I don&#39;t know why okay uh here we go dollar rolling over oh this is interesting the EU Aerospace and defense index up dramatically relative to the mag7 index a lot of things are up relative it&#39;s it&#39;s not hard to beat 7.7% if you go to mag which is the mag 7 ETF it&#39;s down 7.7% maybe a little more by the close 10year yield down for seven straight weeks remember at 480 everyone was calling for five and I said three handle before five handle and uh we may not see a five handle before Trump is out of office so um that&#39;s that Goldman Sachs top down S&P 500 forecast we talk about guidance coming down home affordability is the lowest it&#39;s been since 20067 8 that doesn&#39;t mean we&#39;re going to have a housing crisis but I do think we are going to have some normalization of prices probably somewhat offset by lower mortgage rates creating demand so it&#39;ll be a wash and that affordability will go up as the cost of ownership goes down you know if you take a 10year from 480 down to 350 and you get 30-year fix rates at 5.5 the affordability from 7 two which it was a week ago not a week ago a month ago for a 30-year fix down to 55 uh you know that&#39;s huge that cuts 25 30% off the monthly payment and uh even if uh prices come down 10% I think you&#39;re going to see huge demand bids so not a housing crisis but an opportunity in the making except where there&#39;s super froth you know there&#39;s some areas where houses doubled after Co then doubled again uh those I could getting hit 30% may you know uh but we&#39;ll see chop frustration is normal we got that uh shortterm sentiment extremely pessimistic that&#39;s just another indicator pointing to a technical bounce here in coming days and weeks put volume second highest Spike of all time um you know so that tends to be a contrarian indicator large caps to small caps S&P 500 uh divided by Russell 2000 haven&#39;t seen it since 2001 I think you are going to see a ripy face off rally in small caps once we get through this tariff noise and going into the close I do think that Trump was saying that he likes the president of Mexico or something and uh he&#39;s going to back off on certain things I you know it&#39;s dayto day welcome to Trump 2.0 same as Trump 1.0 another day another headline another volatility and it resolves to the upside so uh just uh enjoy enjoy the show ladies and gentlemen growth of okay so that&#39;s that uh bull bear spread we covered crowded and cracking it was momentum and it&#39;s getting smashed I think uh paler was down another 10% or 8% today uh mag seven earnings reminder decelerating uh unmagnify accelerating that&#39;s why the opportunities are going to be in the UNM magnificent 493 and uh coming out of the mag even if you get this technical bounce so uh I it&#39;ll be interesting to see when they get this bounce in the next few weeks how many people chase up when they get near back near the top of the recent range and then they get smacked again but uh time will tell uh 50% of stocks outperforming the S&P 500 up from just 30% last year this is what we saw last when 2001 what happened then regime change International outperformed value outperformed growth International outperformed domestic F value outperform growth small cap outperform large cap ### MISCELLANEOUS\nI continue to repeat this because it continues to not be believed and even as it&#39;s happening right under everyone&#39;s noses in real time and they&#39;re distracted with Trump when they should be paying attention to Japanese bond yields uh active investors have moved closer to the Benchmark since uh 2023 all closet index Huggers complete value list uh in that regard and uh smart people know and have figured that out and allocate to people that are uncorrelated with the indes uh or low correlation because they&#39;re actually doing real work uh 10-year treasury yield rolling over retail investors pile on Hong Kong listings through margin loans yeeha let it rip ladies and gentlemen Mainland buying Baba like it&#39;s going out of style uh as we had anticipated last summer and Brendan ahern&#39;s done a good job job of documenting that on his Twitter feed definitely check him out um us 10-year yield testing 2025 lows no one\n\nEuropean stocks rally to start 2025 uncertainty at an all-time high that&#39;s when you want to be a buyer not a seller and that&#39;s the GDP estimates gone down to 2.4% uh Wards Automotive US Auto Sales SAR uh was sales were down 2% in February understandable with consumer confidence through the floor with the fears around tariffs creating inflation again it&#39;s not whether the outcome is good or bad it&#39;s whether Wall Street knows the rules and once we have certainty in policy Market&#39;s going to go straight up on that type of 18.2% earnings growth uh guidance was weak it&#39;s expected to be weak the first two weeks every two two months every year but not as bad as I thought the estimates are still holding in at 271 down from Peak 275 which is really not a big downgrade and 2025 six rather has gone up so as always backend loaded set expectations low exceed them everyone&#39;s happy until late summer when we get some seasonal weakness again but in the mean time the party will be on again on no one&#39;s Bingo cards right now but wait and see and that&#39;s what you will see so crypto flows you know the one thing that the crypto community may have overlooked is be careful what you wish for um you know that the thesis behind Bitcoin in particular because uh some of the others have great like great utility I&#39;ve had great conversations with experts in ethereum I think that&#39;s going to be something to pay attention to as a real platform but uh it&#39;s not what I do so I&#39;m not even going to comment on it and I&#39;m not even it&#39;s just it&#39;s like I&#39;m a golfer I I don&#39;t watch basketball that much so like I can enjoy basketball but I I have zero value at around basketball so I I have I&#39;m completely agnostic about this but as it relates to bitcoin because I see sailor a lot on TV and everything uh and leveraging up like it&#39;s going out of style and borrowing money to buy more Bitcoin and all that stuff and maybe it&#39;ll end well and so far it&#39;s going well and everyone thinks he&#39;s a genius um but what they don&#39;t count on if they get what they want which is a crypto-friendly uh Administration putting regulation in um being pro crypto is that the very thing that put them in the position that they are is the perceived scarcity around Bitcoin and what they may not be accounting for is the amount of assets allocated to crypto um that only have you know three or for legitimate places to go whether Bitcoin ethereum a couple others maybe um when the administration does what they want them to do um hundreds if not thousands of new crypto issuers are going to come to bear and compete for that fixed bucket of crypto assets and you could say well the bucket will grow maybe it&#39;ll grow a bit that that that that&#39;s certainly possible possible that wouldn&#39;t surprise me at all but you are going to have thousands of new issuers getting into the gold rush and while everyone thought the particular coin or token was scarce what they didn&#39;t count on is an is an unlimited supply of coins and tokens that may be quote unquote scarce but the overall bucket becomes unlimited and it dilutes the hell out of each individual one and only the ones that actually have utility in terms of transaction owners ship um uh Etc which is you know one or two um we get washed away so that&#39;s where it is uh I have nothing really valuable to say maybe well we we won&#39;t but um so something to keep in mind uh Brent down I keep looking for more opportunities and energy and I keep pointing right back to com stock resources which we have a big position side by side with Jerry Jones uh none of the other stuff is coming out here&#39;s where we are in terms of tariffs again we&#39;ve covered this on TV uh if he does a 100% of everything we&#39;re still nowhere near where we were uh at the we we would be still below where we were in the mid-20s remember they raised tariffs for some 12 straight years of economic Prosperity before you got to smooth Holly um so that&#39;s that&#39;s where we are that&#39;s where we make maybe if if everything happens but already he&#39;s walking back Mexico so that takes it back down uh we are at record low historic tariffs so just keep that in mind ### MACRO_DATA_SLIDES\nnatural gas going straight through the roof we like that okay Logistics managers this is interesting the logistics managers Index this relates to gxo Rose for a second consecutive month to 62.8 making the strongest growth in logistics sector since June 2022 again dstock cycle to restock cycle which we&#39;ve covered many many times on this podcast sharp increase in inventory levels this led to higher inventory costs in warehousing prices while warehousing capacity decreased because they had a glut of warehousing capacity remember they built out too much because everything that happened at Co Peak now it&#39;s being absorbed um and and so on and so forth so that should bode well for gxo in coming quarters once the CMA stuff is pretty much resolved and the new CEO is announced which will be a rock star if passes any prologue as it relates to the type of people that uh Brad Jacobs attracts share of clients expecting the US to be the best performing Global Equity region at the Goldman Sachs Global strategy conference in January the highest percentage of managers expected us to be the best this year and they were all wrong it&#39;s not even a competition S&amp;P up uh excuse me S&amp;P down close to 1% year to date Europe up up 15% uh kweb up 25% Bob up 65% uh you know there you go that&#39;s that chances of a cut we covered us trade policy uncertainty index I mean this is where opportunities are made everything that got hit by tariffs I think is going to be the buy opportunity of a Sentry in coming weeks um and we&#39;ll just wait and see percentage of companies expected to outpace the mag seven up from just 8% at the lows of second half 2023 going straight up and so on and these are also coincidentally um yeah the times you want that that you start to see massive broadening ### FEATURED_COMPANY_DEEP_DIVES\nAlibaba Shar held via southbound stock connect absolutely ramping up every single Mainland Chinese person is buying Alibaba stock like it&#39;s going out of style billions more billions in billions more to come and the international people will slowly but surely start to be forced in not because they want to invest in China but because they want to keep their jobs and the problem is is they&#39;re so underweight China and they&#39;re so underweight International and they&#39;re dramatically underperforming and they now have job risk so all of the sudden their ideology about G and communism and all the excuses uh go out the window just like you saw with all the woke is broke once they start going up everyone chases them and this time will be no different mortgage rates coming down they&#39;re going to go a lot lower China sets official deficit at decades high level they&#39;re going to stimulate till the cows come home deficit spending like

daily trading sentiment has fallen to extreme pessimism from Ryan Dietrich uh ndr research rather uh this is where you get these technical bounces so pay attention that&#39;s bespoke same thing a lot of different indicators pointing to the same thing that&#39;s the Fed so last year&#39;s we said the last will be first that&#39;s been the case international Healthcare Etc the first shall be last paler Nvidia they&#39;re probably the uh so they were the best last year uh in the last two weeks paler is down 32% Nvidia is down 16% this is probably uh as of March 4th and that&#39;s just the last two weeks year-to date it&#39;s double that probably on both of those um what else is getting smashed broadcom uh Arista networks Marvel Netflix um Tesla and so on Alibaba stock Rose More than 70% since the January low Euro rebounds to four-month high against the US dollar is weakening euro is strengthening dollar is rolling over similar to Trump 1.0 we covered that look at this move in the euro China switches priority to consumption in work report from highquality development they did a complete 180 degree turnaround from last year and look what&#39;s happening um semiconductor cycle that&#39;s the semiconductor cycle we covered last week small cap out performer this is interesting this is that last time we saw these levels were early 2000s and then again in 2009 and then we had an A Monster outperformance in small caps following those periods so it&#39;s definitely worth paying attention to there&#39;s the kweb just getting started cranking uh kudos to Brenan we were in the Foxhole together I remember when we played golf together uh someone and I I put a picture on Twitter I think it was in the late summer or early fall or something like that and uh it was near the lows and someone said uh Tom and brandan getting together is going to Mark the bottom in China and they were right it basically went straight up ever since then so uh so that&#39;s that um here&#39;s another put volume this this is a wash out all these people that record Put volume on the day I was on with vanney those people are going to get flushed the sellers of the puts are going going to be the ones that made all the money the buyers are going to get smoked um you you know just for future reference ladies and gentlemen you want to buy insurance on your house before you have a fire it&#39;s amazing how many people buy puts in the hole when the not only is the price near the bottom but the implied volatility is at record highs and people are buying puts in the hole as if that&#39;s going to protect them uh it&#39;s too late you know you can&#39;t call Chub after after the house is half burning down it&#39;s just one the premiums would be too high and two they don&#39;t protect much because you only get half a house so uh leave it at that want to put this guy on uh he had some interesting things to say about uh daily domestic consumption U David final question for you we&#39;ve we&#39;ve yet to talk about tariffs in this specific conversation and the re the reason I frame it that way is I&#39;m curious to what extent tariffs or the external challenges will be referenced these next few days well I let me be fair Frank okay I I strongly believe this time around tariff is no longer a big issue I would even if you give me a order of three top issues in China or challenges in China I don&#39;t even put top three even among the top three the Tariff from president Trump in fact the whole economy Was preparing for 40% even 60% of tariff hike from president Trump now he&#39;s only imposing 10% of course they indirect tariff upon Chinese uh products from Mexico from Canada from Europe but overall it&#39;s still smaller than people anticipated it&#39;s smaller than uh the year of 2018 so this time around we the Chinese economy is fully fully prepared I do not think the the Tariff is big issue the really to deal with tariff is the same as deal with other issues in Chinese economy that is to boost domestic consumption and on this issue there&#39;s already tremendous tremendous discussions and also a lot of policies will be implemented down the road and we&#39;re back uh ### HEADLINES_AND_NEWS\nAlibaba stock is rising why is Bucking the tech selloff uh obviously this is not this is the more optimistic writer and he&#39;s

consequence that no one is positioned for thinking tariffs are going to crush Advanced Auto Parts and Crush Cooper standard and and what&#39;s going to happen in reality is it&#39;s going to pull

you know they're making continual Investments but the growth rate t\n\nEuropean stocks rally to start 2025 uncertainty at an all-time high that&#39;s when you want to be a buyer not a seller and that&#39;s the GDP estimates gone down to 2.4% uh Wards Automotive US Auto Sales SAR uh was sales were down 2% in February understandable with consumer confidence through the floor with the fears around tariffs creating inflation again it&#39;s not whether the outcome is good or bad it&#39;s whether Wall Street knows the rules and once we have certainty in policy Market&#39;s going to go straight up on that type of 18.2% earnings growth uh guidance was weak it&#39;s expected to be weak the first two weeks every two two months every year but not as bad as I thought the estimates are still holding in at 271 down from Peak 275 which is really not a big downgrade and 2025 six rather has gone up so as always backend loaded set expectations low exceed them everyone&#39;s happy until late summer when we get some seasonal weakness again but in the mean time the party will be on again on no one&#39;s Bingo cards right now but wait and see and that&#39;s what you will see so crypto flows you know the one thing that the crypto community may have overlooked is be careful what you wish for um you know that the thesis behind Bitcoin in particular because uh some of the others have great like great utility I&#39;ve had great conversations with experts in ethereum I think that&#39;s going to be something to pay attention to as a real platform but uh it&#39;s not what I do so I&#39;m not even going to comment on it and I&#39;m not even it&#39;s just it&#39;s like I&#39;m a golfer I I don&#39;t watch basketball that much so like I can enjoy basketball but I I have zero value at around basketball so I I have I&#39;m completely agnostic about this but as it relates to bitcoin because I see sailor a lot on TV and everything uh and leveraging up like it&#39;s going out of style and borrowing money to buy more Bitcoin and all that stuff and maybe it&#39;ll end well and so far it&#39;s going well and everyone thinks he&#39;s a genius um but what they don&#39;t count on if they get what they want which is a crypto-friendly uh Administration putting regulation in um being pro crypto is that the very thing that put them in the position that they are is the perceived scarcity around Bitcoin and what they may not be accounting for is the amount of assets allocated to crypto um that only have you know three or for legitimate places to go whether Bitcoin ethereum a couple others maybe um when the administration does what they want them to do um hundreds if not thousands of new crypto issuers are going to come to bear and compete for that fixed bucket of crypto assets and you could say well the bucket will grow maybe it&#39;ll grow a bit that that that that&#39;s certainly possible possible that wouldn&#39;t surprise me at all but you are going to have thousands of new issuers getting into the gold rush and while everyone thought the particular coin or token was scarce what they didn&#39;t count on is an is an unlimited supply of coins and tokens that may be quote unquote scarce but the overall bucket becomes unlimited and it dilutes the hell out of each individual one and only the ones that actually have utility in terms of transaction owners ship um uh Etc which is you know one or two um we get washed away so that&#39;s where it is uh I have nothing really valuable to say maybe well we we won&#39;t but um so something to keep in mind uh Brent down I keep looking for more opportunities and energy and I keep pointing right back to com stock resources which we have a big position side by side with Jerry Jones uh none of the other stuff is coming out here&#39;s where we are in terms of tariffs again we&#39;ve covered this on TV uh if he does a 100% of everything we&#39;re still nowhere near where we were uh at the we we would be still below where we were in the mid-20s remember they raised tariffs for some 12 straight years of economic Prosperity before you got to smooth Holly um so that&#39;s that&#39;s where we are that&#39;s where we make maybe if if everything happens but already he&#39;s walking back Mexico so that takes it back down uh we are at record low historic tariffs so just keep that in mind ### MACRO_DATA_SLIDES\nnatural gas going straight through the roof we like that okay Logistics managers this is interesting the logistics managers Index this relates to gxo Rose for a second consecutive month to 62.8 making the strongest growth in logistics sector since June 2022 again dstock cycle to restock cycle which we&#39;ve covered many many times on this podcast sharp increase in inventory levels this led to higher inventory costs in warehousing prices while warehousing capacity decreased because they had a glut of warehousing capacity remember they built out too much because everything that happened at Co Peak now it&#39;s being absorbed um and and so on and so forth so that should bode well for gxo in coming quarters once the CMA stuff is pretty much resolved and the new CEO is announced which will be a rock star if passes any prologue as it relates to the type of people that uh Brad Jacobs attracts share of clients expecting the US to be the best performing Global Equity region at the Goldman Sachs Global strategy conference in January the highest percentage of managers expected us to be the best this year and they were all wrong it&#39;s not even a competition S&amp;P up uh excuse me S&amp;P down close to 1% year to date Europe up up 15% uh kweb up 25% Bob up 65% uh you know there you go that&#39;s that chances of a cut we covered us trade policy uncertainty index I mean this is where opportunities are made everything that got hit by tariffs I think is going to be the buy opportunity of a Sentry in coming weeks um and we&#39;ll just wait and see percentage of companies expected to outpace the mag seven up from just 8% at the lows of second half 2023 going straight up and so on and these are also coincidentally um yeah the times you want

their debt they&#39;re closing the stores that they needed to close they&#39;re consolidating the the supply chains uh listen to this interview we&#39;re not going to play this interview with with uh Shane o Kelly on the podcast because we simply don&#39;t have enough time but if you own one share of this stock you should listen to this interview I mean at the end of the day nothing has changed from my original thesis which is very simple 7% operating margin which they&#39;re still affirming couple years out last time that implies 600 million of operating income 630 million dollar of operating income and the last time they had that was 2019 2022 um there were four times that it hit that level of operating income and in those years the stock traded between $186 and $244 and here we have it at $35 you can&#39;t give it away uh with the balance sheet healthy with a competent management executing on the plan and uh so you know no no big deal uh it&#39;s raining gold we&#39;re pulling out the buckets you do whatever you think makes sense uh so go through this with fine tooth comb if you own even one share of that and then PayPal opportunity of a lifetime here uh to take advantage and there was an interview with a guy named Crossroads and he&#39;s basically like he&#39;s just like a college student or PhD student he doesn&#39;t manage any money but he likes stocks and he uh got an interview with Alex Chris and it was a phenomenal interview the full 30 minutes you should listen to the full 30 minutes this is huge uh and we can&#39;t talk too much about the stock price and price AC action but it seems to me as an investor that there&#39;s a disconnect between what the market is seeing for PayPal and it&#39;s reflected in the price action versus the direction that you guys are clearly heading and so what do you think is the biggest factor that the market may be overlooking in PayPal right now [Music] um I have no idea you know I I came here I think the the stock was um significantly undervalued we&#39;re up 20% year-over-year and I think we&#39;re still dramatically undervalued um we we inflected uh a business that had been losing uh money for two years in a row and delivered you know if I&#39;d come to you a year ago and said you know how would you feel about 5% transaction margin 6% transaction margin in 24 I think pretty much everyone would have been like yeah there&#39;s no possible way you can do that and we delivered it um and then we put uh together you know again we&#39;re being prudent I I had a lot of conversations with investors when I got here and um a lot of the feedback was hey in the past the company had been really bullish on projections and then missed and that&#39;s just not my style that&#39;s not the mentality that we have and so we&#39;re going to tell you when we when we say something we&#39;ve got line of sight to it and we&#39;re going to go execute against it my guess is um there&#39;s been a lot of suffering in this stock in the last few years you just have to look at the chart and and understand that you know there was a Peak and then it fell and so we&#39;ve got a lot of investors both retail and and institutional that have lived through that and I think with a brand new leadership team coming in um we&#39;re in a bit of a waitand see mode and the best thing we can do is deliver for customers execute our plan provide you as much transparency as possible as to what we&#39;re doing and have a very high say do ratio um we beat every quarter that we told we were what we were going to do um abely I know everyone wants us to beat by even more and like all of that happens we also have to recognize that the Innovations we&#39;re putting out um take time right I this is just I&#39;ve worked in different businesses this just happens to be one where you know we are at a scale where when we put a merchant Innovation out like these new Innovations we have for for Branded checkout they are crushing it when you look at the conversion rate Improvement it just takes time to roll this out like we&#39;re talking about tens of Millions of merchants and even the largest Enterprise ones it just takes time to get into their ecosystem we make a consumer change we launch PayPal everywhere it takes time I mean the fact that we got three million new PayPal everywhere debit card users in the first you know quarter and a half is it&#39;s insanely fast it is and it&#39;s still not good enough right because because everyone wants more and so absolutely look I don&#39;t know how long it&#39;s going to take for folks to sort of say hey we&#39;re gonna we understand that this leadership team is delivering on their on their commitments um but if you&#39;re looking for you know everything to turn around in in two months this probably isn&#39;t the right stock for you uh this is this is a business that we are building a flywheel that becomes the leader in in Commerce for the next decade and Beyond and that may take a few quarters or a couple of years and I think we were uh again we put out some um I think pretty exciting uh goals at yesterday in terms of what we think our long-term um transaction margin and EPS growth will look like we wouldn&#39;t put those out if we didn&#39;t have L line ofite to if we didn&#39;t know that hey when we execute uh on these growth levers and we&#39;ve got lots of growth levers now uh when we execute on this we&#39;re going to deliver it so you know again apologies that this isn&#39;t a fast you know flip of the switch and all of a sudden everything turns around but 800 basis point Improvement in transaction margin in the first you know year is is pretty significant and uh I think we&#39;re just getting started yeah and the Topline numbers you know may not be what some people are expecting and hoping but the bottom line that&#39;s right I feel like PayPal has been lacking let&#39;s I mean let&#39;s talk about that so I got here and you know we had really good Revenue growth numbers right really good Revenue growth numbers empty calories right Revenue growth numbers with declining transaction margin so look it may be it may be uncomfortable and it may be the hard decisions but I&#39;m going to make the right decisions for the company for the long term and going back and having price to Value conversations I won&#39;t apologize for that I mean our our revenue is absolutely slowing for a period of time until we have these conversations but I can tell you the conversations we&#39;re having are incredible the conversations we&#39;re having with Merchants now to be able to price the value for them to be able to take all the different value added Services we&#39;re bringing together to now have conversations about ads we are having healthy relationships that are building the foundation for growth for the future so it is absolutely the right decision and we&#39;ve been as transparent as we can around hey revenue is going to come down for a couple of quarters and then we&#39;ll inflect and grow back but I would much rather rip the bandid off have the hard decisions and build this company for the long term then grab a couple more quarters of increasing empty calorie Revenue that&#39;s not delivering anything for the company for the long term but it looks really good and I I just don&#39;t want to do that I want to build this for the long term so if you&#39;re interested in in being with us for the longterm which I know you are uh then I think I think uh um this is the right place for you and and you know if you want a quarter of just you know Big Poppy\n\n### FEATURED_COMPANY_DEEP_DIVES\nrebuild a shareholder base um this one is interesting though so uh I think it just got to be super patient I think this one might be actually okay here we've looked at it a number of times I hate to even take the time to do it I I think this one's generally going to be okay but you just you have to do a lot of work you got to understand like what why first off you need to understand the short story why is it down so much uh and what's the story is it the stuff in it makes you sick or is it something else and what are they doing to resolve and alleviate that what's happening with volumes and why did they have to buy Acquisitions to reignite growth versus continue to grow organically did they stall um but I think the balance is probably okay here uh liability long-term debt looks good let's take a look at income statement uh 1.3 billion so they're kind of stalling I mean this is the problem they were doubling every year and then they stalled out um and sometimes they stall out before they declin sometimes they stall out before they re accelerate so you got to be clear on the international story why are they stalling is it is the market limit or did they was it a fad or is it durable like monster beverage was one of the greatest stocks of all time Hansen uh and uh what are we doing with the share count here they're adding a lot of shares man I don't like that uh this one's definitely worth doing more work on because I do think you can get a doubler triple if you're right um so I'll write that one down again just it's it's very hard to have an edge because you're kind of predicting the future of consumer fads because it's not not been around long enough and there it's a very crowded space unlike when monster beverage came to Market unlike when Red Bull came to Market that doesn't mean it can't be done just uh it's not a guarantee okay and I think we have nailed it and we've done all of the questions  so",
    "MISCELLANEOUS": "\n\n### MISCELLANEOUS\nwhat&#39;s happening with what I love you you I&#39;ve stolen it from you I hope you don&#39;t mind it&#39;s flattery right I mean I&#39;m I&#39;m copying you the UNM magnificent 493 what&#39;s going on with them you know I thought a lot more people would steal that phrase I say it every single week uh you know we do a lot of the same shows together H it hasn&#39;t caught on so so maybe now that you say it you know you&#39;re more handsome people will listen uh that would incredible got a chuckle from everyone here in the studio so they obviously don&#39;t believe that but what yeah what&#39;s the growth rates looking for them I mean is it re accelerating is it stable exactly so it was basically negative for a couple quarters then it then it got low single digits uh towards the end of last year it&#39;s going to accelerate up to low double digits in coming quarters towards the end of the year early next year while the mag 7 is decelerating so there&#39;s huge opportunities under the surface and small caps depending which index you look at Lou uh Russell 2000 because they&#39;re coming off such a low base 40% plus earnings growth uh small caps uh S&P 600 21% earnings growth you can&#39;t give these away they&#39;re in the gutter right now because of the Tariff noise but uh that that&#39;s going to get resolved welcome to Trump 2.0 same as Trump 1.0 daily volatility and we go up 100% I was on vanney on Monday and they asked you know what do you think about tariffs I&#39;m like look they&#39;re going to go into effect tomorrow on Tuesday and I wouldn&#39;t be surprised by Friday if they&#39;re not in effect and we it took till Wednesday until they started repealing or revising some so I think you&#39;re you&#39;re absolutely right great opportunities um I want to go before we we kind of close out\n\nwhat&#39;s your thoughts on the fed&#39;s next move I think Jerome Powell is the Rodney danger field of Finance he gets absolutely no respect and rightfully so CU he&#39;s screwed the pooch on the front side of predicting inflation but what do you think his next move is in light of all the market conditions well it&#39;s interesting looking at today the odds of a June cut just went up to 85% uh you know we talk about all these things that none of which were on people&#39;s Bingo cards at the turn of the year whether it&#39;s International outperformance whether it&#39;s dollar weakening whether it&#39;s yields compressing or whether it&#39;s the FED now cutting which you know just a few weeks ago everyone saying no Cuts in 2025 we&#39;re g to get two cuts at least one to two c so you think two I I&#39;ve been on the record saying it&#39;s maybe one maybe none uh that was a couple weeks ago for me the big sticking points were the categories of inflation that were were stubbornly high so food shelter and energy those are not things you can quickly correct so my thesis has been that look we&#39;re going to get stubbornly higher inflation stuck in the three and a half range and because of that that you know Pal&#39;s going to have to wait but you think possibly two cuts which at the end of the way that fed put&#39;s going to be worth while for stock investors so it&#39;s a net positive for us exactly the more you know look last thing I just want to say keep an eye on the 10year jgb yields this is the most important chart that no one else is paying attention to uh those are climbing because the bank of Japan has to hike to quell inflation which is growing after 10 you know 20 years of printing money crazy right like never ever do we think we would be in the situation in Japan with them coming off zero if you you look at the last Peak was late July before you had that mag seven scare in early August yeah a lot of hot money has come into the mag7 which is a very crowded trade it&#39;s getting it&#39;s starting to uncrowded to quell inflation the more hot money is going to come out of Mag s so that&#39;s why the opportunities in UNM mag 493 small caps International Etc does doesn&#39;t mean you have to get out of these great businesses it just means uh more moderation and I think that&#39;s the going to be a theme in opportunity in 2025 for sure\n### MEDIA_APPEARANCE_RECAP\nand I want to reemphasize something that is critically important that I covered with Lou and that is uh the most important chart that no one is paying attention to uh and I posted this on Twitter so you can see it here uh this is the uh Japanese 10-year bond yield at 152 and I found it comical all day uh every single major commentator was blaming Tech being down 3% on tariffs which has nothing to do with it whatsoever and what what we really have happening and you&#39;re seeing it as the 10-year yield has been going down one thing that people haven&#39;t been paying attention to is European bond yields blowing out and more importantly the Japanese 10-year yield this is the key to the markets continues to go up and what that means is the carry trade is unwinding as the boj has to now raise rates to fight off inflation from 20 continuous years of printing money um uh the free money is drying up and a lot of that hot free money that they were able to borrow in Yen for free and buy Mag 7 the most crowded trade in the world is now evaporating as capital has a cost it&#39;s coming out of the overvalued pockets of the market and finding undervalued pockets of the market like China uh you know whether it&#39;s Baba up 65% year-to date whether it&#39;s kweb up uh 25% Europe up 15% Etc um uh that Trend will continue that said it would not Shock me to see a bounce in the mag 7 what we said for 2025 was that mag 7 would underperform index us index returns would be subdued because mag 7 is such an incredibly High weight uh and for you know a huge opportunity under the surface in UNM magnificent 493 but much more so in international and also believe uh on the Tailwind is going to be small cap you got to pay attention to that but amazing mag s down 7.7% uh and um so keep an eye as long as that those jgb yields keep going up you&#39;re going to see continued pressure on mag 7 I think we&#39;re due for a technical bounce here on mag s they could even go as high as the top of their recent range I wouldn&#39;t bet on it but it wouldn&#39;t surprise me um uh and then we&#39;re going to get through that period of seasonality that we&#39;ve discussed in many uh of the last podcast where February and the first two weeks of March in a postelection year is very weak and then you get a monstrous uh uh uh kind of rally in late March all the way through May June uh and I that would not surprise me whatsoever earnings growth coming in at 18.2% this quarter keeping Ane on GDP down uh GDP now is estimated to come in at negative -2.4 the other thing that few people are paying attention to is now uh uh fed fund Futures 85% chance of a cut in June which is why I was uh leaning with L to one to two cuts um and uh 10year yield and and US dollar continues to fall which favors International then I had the pleasure to join uh Kai Hoffman on sore financially for his podcast uh a few days back and we&#39;re going to listen in here every single dip in Alibaba we bought because it was the cheapest amount of value for the highest earnings growth and upside opportunity and uh when it turns it turns all at once and you know yeah 60% in a few weeks but it&#39;s early days for the China trade for years uh politicians have been substantiating their existence by creating more and more regulation putting more and more Governors against growth uh and um and Trump is throwing that playbook [Music] out hello and welcome to sore financially a channel where we discuss the macro to understand the micro my name is Kai Hoffman I&#39;m the Ed Jr mining guy over on X and of course I&#39;m your host of this Channel and I&#39;m looking forward to welcoming a First Time guest to the program it&#39;s Tom Hayes he&#39;s the chairman of great Hill capital and I&#39;m really looking forward to discussing with him like the General Market Outlook and the state of the economy uh I know he&#39;s strong on the AI side and he&#39;s brought us or he&#39;s bringing us some ideas on where to invest over 2025 what is he looking at and what are some of the ideas that he&#39;s following really looking forward to this discussion um before I switch over to my guest please be reminded to hit that like And subscribe button helps us out tremendously we much appreciate it and thank you for it so Tom it is great to have you on the program it&#39;s good to see you thank you so much for joining us thanks for having me Kai glad to be here yeah really looking forward to this a bit of a different perspective on what we usually talk about so we&#39;re we&#39;re really going to keep it mainstream almost like it&#39;s called mainstream because we were just chatting and you said oh you&#39;re gold Focus Channel I was like yeah but we&#39;re trying to widen the audience a little bit and just cover topics that a I&#39;m maybe personally not as strong in but also interested is just the general markets and you touched on a couple topics Emerging Markets small cap indices like really looking forward to learning more about that Tom um but before we get to that we we really got to start at a high level I&#39;m going to ask you since you&#39;re a First Time guest on the program like what&#39;s your current assessment of the economy and the financial markets I think on balance the economy is strong earnings are very strong we just got through earning season for Q4 the the bulk of it is done uh 16.9% earnings growth which is phenomenal uh that&#39;s the good news the bad news is guidance has been a little weaker than expected and S&amp;P earnings have come down expectations for this year from you know 275 for the S&amp;P down to like below 270 some shops are at 268 uh but it&#39;s not terribly concerning because this is the part of the year that I like to refer to as sandbagger season meaning uh seasonally uh CEOs tend to take down guidance in the first quarter to set expectations low so they can beat for the subsequent three quarters and I think that that will be no different this year it&#39;s where we are we&#39;re in the normal late February volatility chop uh that we see not only most years as February is the second worst month of the year but we see in a pronounced way postelection years on average since 1950 the S&amp;P is down 1.3% in February so here we are uh you know a handful of more days and then we&#39;ll probably start to find a bid on some some of the stocks that have been hammered oh absolutely no it&#39;s a you know seasonality is a big factor we we can get to that but uh I I got a burning question here like 16.9% earnings like growth where does it come from yeah it&#39;s it&#39;s been pretty broad you know the the whole theme for 2025 that we&#39;ve been talking about for you know a number of months on our our podcast and our public appearances has been the mag mag Magnificent Seven earnings that drove the bus in 2024 uh is De decelerating dramatically in 2025 so you had magnificent s grow earnings in 2024 at about 33% and what outperformed in 2024 magnificent 7 it&#39;s not a mystery uh the problem is and the dichotomy in the market is this year earning growth for the mag 7 are going to decelerate from 33% down to now it&#39;s about 16% almost half and the real problem is the multiples have not compressed commensurate with the D celeration in earnings growth so multiples have stayed up they&#39;re starting to come in a little bit but you know if you look at the rest of the market their earnings growth is going to accelerate from you know uh 3 3 4% last year to you know 13 14 15% and the multiple is a lot lower maybe 16 17 times 18 times versus the MA 7 at 33 times so I think people are figuring this out and they&#39;re reallocating which is why the mag 7 is down over one and a half% year to date while uh the S&amp;P is up to and change uh and some of the laggards from last year like materials and healthc Care are up you know five six seven percent year-to dat let&#39;s break that down even more so you&#39;re you&#39;re talking materials is growing there must be some consumer confidence and uh perfect topic for today cuz I wrote down consumer confidence missed expectations like yeah how does that fit together like when you see materials meanings like okay I can spend money on Home Improvement and other things I hope I&#39;m interpreting this right uh Tom but like where&#39;s that confidence coming from that we&#39;re not seeing in the numbers yeah so the consumer confidence is largely a function of a number of things uh number one is tariff fears people have uh been fed this narrative that tariffs will lead to sustainable inflation uh history doesn&#39;t bear that out it&#39;s a one time so let&#39;s say hypothetically all the tariffs that are promised go into place and it&#39;s 25% it&#39;s a one-time bump it&#39;s not 25% compounded at 3% per year uh and that&#39;s not that&#39;s not the way it works so what you find as you saw in 2018 with washing machines you get a short-term bump in price you look intermediate term a year later uh they&#39;re kind of kind of flat and then you know two years out they&#39;re actually down uh so people are are worried about the uncertainty of tariffs they&#39;re worried a little bit about inflation which by the way this time of year the January reports and the February reports tend to come in a little hotter seasonally so you know the last inflation reports were a little concerning for people but that is normal for this time of the year uh and I think a lot of this will be put behind us that said uh are people reallocating to where they can get more more earnings growth for a lower multiple you bet and we&#39;re seeing the move in particular into International stocks which are dramatically outperforming uh you know S&amp;P up two in change European equities up 10% that was on no one&#39;s Bingo cards coming into the year and emerging markets in China Emerging Markets up 7 and a half percent and China absolutely flying China Tech uh and that&#39;s our largest position and we&#39;ve been building that you know it&#39;s not like we just picked it five weeks and it went straight up I mean we&#39;ve been building that position for two years every single dip in Alibaba we bought because it was the cheapest amount of value for the highest earnings growth and upside opportunity and uh when it turns it turns all at once and you know yeah 60% in a few weeks but it&#39;s early days for the China trade very early days it&#39;s as as things seem to be calming down uh towards or like to the aggression towards China seems to be calming down a little bit I don&#39;t know that&#39;s again got feeling that&#39;s what I&#39;m sensing and you&#39;re sort of confirming it I I want to get to Alibaba L when we talk more tech stocks and like investment ideas um I want to stay on the fundamentals for now and I know we&#39;re going to get a lot of flak and people turning off when you said the economy is strong because my audience believes the economy is weak it&#39;s weakening um and there are definitely cracks in the system um visible and it seems like there&#39;s a bit of a uh discrepancy uh there was an article in the Wall Street Journal that I discussed with another guest the other day where like 10% of the spending or sorry the 10% are doing most of the spending while 90% the spending is going down dramatically um if I if I find it I&#39;ll bring it up in a second but I&#39;m curious like how where break that down like the economy is strong like what what do you base yeah so look I mean you had uh two recessions in two years in 2020 during covid you had two negative quarters of GDP growth or lack thereof and you in 2022 they never called it a recession but you had two quarters of NE consecutive quarters of negative GDP growth right now our GDP growth depending what trackers you look at but let&#39;s just say Atlanta fed GDP now is at 2.3% Goldman&#39;s a little more bearish at 1.9% you don&#39;t get a recession with positive GDP okay so whether it comes in at one and a half or two and a half it&#39;s really IMM material the key is it&#39;s growing despite the headwinds now to your point are people at the lower end of the economic spectrum uh struggling a little bit yes we we see all the data we&#39;re not blind to the default rate going up on credit cards a little bit on auto loans uh and and the like you&#39;ve had rates go up dramatically and you&#39;ve had people that became accustomed that weren&#39;t accustomed to being able to spend a lot of discretionary money that were you know force-fed checks from the government and got used to spending and eating out and doing all those things so when the money dried up they kept it going on their credit card so yeah there&#39;s going to be some pain at the low end but that you know that&#39;s that&#39;s been the bell curve since day one and uh not only did the top 10% uh percent make up you know 50% or more of the spending uh they pay a ton of the taxes so it&#39;s always been that way it&#39;s probably going to be that way but what I will say is that in Trump 1.0 uh the lower and middle class did a lot better than they did under Biden and they were really starting in terms of employment rates among minorities in terms of real wages increasing uh in terms of all that that group did the best and I think that&#39;s going to be the case in Trump 2.0 so if the cost of that is a little volatility in the US indices and for those of you who are in exclusively passive indexing in the S&amp;P 500 you&#39;re going to feel it because the mag 7 is you know 35% weight of that and their earnings are decelerating their capex is going up their margins are going to uh start to feel that if if they don&#39;t get the return which I don&#39;t think anyone expects in the next three to four quarters to see a return on the $300 billion doll of AI investment uh and um and you just have to adjust but on balance I think as we get through the fear of the tar tariffs and the reality or lack thereof of the tariffs uh I think you&#39;re going to find that uh doge is very efficient in cutting costs which is deflationary that is going to offset a lot of the fears around inflation and the 10-year yield is telling you exactly that&#39;s going to happen which is why you saw in the last few quarters couple of quarters uh that hedge funds were the most short the 10year treasury than they&#39;ve been since late 2018 and that was the period that preceded one of the biggest Bond rallies in the shortest period of time yields compressed I think we&#39;re going to see the exact same thing the smart Money commercials are short are long bonds uh very long Bonds longest since 2018 and that&#39;s why you&#39;re seeing the 10-year get bid yields are starting to compress the exact opposite of what everyone was calling for a few weeks ago when the 10e yield was at 480 and everyone said it was going to five and we were out publicly and said nope it&#39;s going to four I think we&#39;re going to four and we may not even stop at four we&#39;re going to see a three handle which is going to shock a lot of people and that is going to Spur a level of growth not in mag 7even but in things like Auto industry in things like homeb building which has gotten left for dead in things like homeb building suppliers uh tool producers like Stanley Black and&amp; Decker which is one of our our positions like JRA which has 75% of the home standby generator this is the kind of stuff that&#39;s not sexy today because everyone wants to chase what&#39;s up the shiny objects and they&#39;re getting their heads handed to them but it&#39;s going to be sexy 6 n months from now when everyone is getting excited about DeWalt construction tools mark my words uh that will be a funny day and maybe I&#39;ll be back to celebrate a little bit of that with you doesn&#39;t doesn&#39;t S you know it it reminds me an awful lot of when everyone was pounding the table that China was uninvestable and we were pounding the table to buy it you know backing up the truck in the 60s when Morgan Stanley was downgrading in the hole and maybe you saw it this week up 100% from there and uh now they&#39;re upgrading China stocks I mean you can&#39;t make this stuff up no clear direction to be quite honest bit flip-flopping in the wind\n### MISCELLANEOUS\nI just quickly want to share that chart with you that that I found and uh you know the US consumer is is really really hurting just looking at cumulative excess savings that&#39;s from the article I mentioned and I&#39;m not sure if you can see that Tom but uh top 10% of earners roughly savings 1.3 trillion the other 90% of earners only have $291 billion saved anymore we all know that the US consumer is not a really a big saver savings rate in the US is 3.8% but we&#39;re trending toward zero here you know and the question is like when do we hit the panic button when are we in like fullon Eco trouble mode um you know right now everything seems fine I do agree like the numbers are not lying yes there&#39;s a Divergence and we&#39;re seeing trouble ahead and everybody feels it differently a little bit depending as this shows like what income level you&#39;re in um right now as well like the disparity is just getting bigger the question is like when are we going to see and I&#39;m like purposely overstating it but when are we going to see like riots in the streets yeah never not not anytime soon I mean the Chinese were the closest to having riots in the street and that&#39;s why they went from you know hunting down out you know Jack ma to wanting to basically put him in PR prison two years ago to now inviting him to meet with xinping and shaking his hand and giving him an award at the most recent uh CEO conference in China so uh I&#39;d be more worried about the risk she really push pushed it up to the edge he had 20% of 25 year olds with education unemployed that&#39;s that&#39;s a formula for a tan square and he was able to Pivot just in time because you saw the the protesting increasing around the country and now he&#39;s flipped everyone&#39;s got says okay the guy had a huge tolerance for pain he&#39;s flipped the switch and now we&#39;re back off to the races in China so so that&#39;s in the rearview mirror now what you&#39;re what you&#39;re blinded not you but the person who uh constructed this chart and article are blinded by is the fact that this is no different than anytime else what they&#39;re comparing it to is a one once in 100y year aberation when the government decided to pump the money pump the economy full of s trillion dollars and put it in the hands of people who historically are not Savers and uh and they&#39;ve proven to the point that they&#39;re still not Savers because they spent it as fast as they could now that it&#39;s running out they&#39;re going back to their normal savings level pre pandemic which was effectively zero and that&#39;s the way it&#39;s always been and uh it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s just you know it&#39;s not a commentary good or bad it&#39;s just the way it is uh as far as whether they&#39;ll they&#39;ll uh they&#39;ll be discontent related to that I think that uh you&#39;re going to see an acceleration of real wages and growth in the economy uh and productivity like you saw in Trump 1.0 in Trump 2.0 in coming quarters and they will be the primary beneficiary so while they&#39;re not saving I think you&#39;re going to see their wages continue to creep up uh and um and and uh but but as far as them Having excess savings the last five years was the exception not the rule yeah no absolutely because we gave them free money like corre that uh like to to quote somebody like somebody&#39;s probably I think Adam tager mentions that a lot like the pick is through the python like I think the pick has been digested almost and uh excrement it I don&#39;t know like correct and look you&#39;ll have credit card defaults that level I mean that&#39;s that&#39;s nothing new it h it happens every single cycle but if you look at high yield credit spreads which is what I pay attention to if you want to worry about if the world is coming to an end worry about high yield credit spreads and right now they&#39;re telling you uh all is Quiet on the Western Front it could change tomorrow but for now it&#39;s in good stead and if companies can refinance their debt and they can hit the capital markets all is well talk about inflation and wage growth I think that&#39;s an interesting combination I how worried are you about inflation in general and wage growth is roughly at 5.7% as we&#39;re you know I checked last week it might be different now but roughly around 5.7% like how how does that fit together are you worried about that is that too too much like how does that fit together yeah I mean look uh Elon Musk is basically firing anyone with a pulse that&#39;s willing to leave uh in the in the public sector I think it&#39;s you know probably in some sense maybe they&#39;ll overshoot and have to rehire some people but in some sense it&#39;s long overdue the issue is going to be uh whether or not the bulk of the people who have had jobs in the public sector uh will or will not be absorbed by the private SE sector I.E does their skill set translate to Value ad which is required in the private sector and the answer is we don&#39;t know yet so I think what you&#39;re going to see is a tick up in the unemployment rate uh which will be offsetting the inflationary Tendencies you&#39;re going to see deflation from the decreased government spending you&#39;re going to see inflation from some of the other parts of the economy um you know rents are still elevated uh housing is still elevated but what as bessent and Trump execute on their plan to bring the 10e yield down why would they focus on that versus the short end of the curve they focus on that because all mortgages are priced off of that all long-term loans are priced off of that and their ability to refinance the US debt is priced off of that and\n\nthe US treasuries are looking to see some semblance of fiscal responsibility and cutting costs so that they can have confidence uh to own hold our debt and and we are showing clear steps in that direction uh we will get to hundreds of billions I don&#39;t know whether we&#39;ll get to a trillion or two trillion for sure I bet against it but the key is Direction and perception and right now that&#39;s moving in the right direction right now that is a deflationary factor offsetting the natural inflationary factors we I think the number one thing is they&#39;re going to have to be careful because at 120% debt to GDP we have not been at this level since post World War II 1948 and how did they bring debt to GDP down from 120% down to 63 by 1956 it&#39;s very simple they ran nominal growth hot GDP ran hot and inflation ran above Trend call it three to four and a half percent over that time period above their 2% Target uh and I think we&#39;re going to have to run it at that level this time and if they do too much on the government spending front uh those deflationary headwinds could offset the needed inflation we need to bring debt to GDP down to a more normalized range uh you look at all the productivity factors that are coming into play Workforce productivity is increasing for a first time in a long time and is going to continue accelerate with some of the Technologies uh that&#39;s going to be super positive for nominal growth I think it was Jensen Wong out there talking about the possibility of 10% GDP growth I mean that&#39;s a little bit uh crazy town but you know you&#39;d be amazed what CEOs will say when they&#39;re selling stock at highs and uh trying to get get people to keep the bid in but uh leaving that aside um on balance there are Crosswinds but um constructive for at least the foreseeable 12 to 24 months that doesn&#39;t preclude normal five to 10% Corrections we get on average 3 5% pullbacks a year you know one 10% correction every year in change one 12% correction every 4.1 years so uh but we did have two of those 20% plus Corrections in two years so we may have pulled forward a few years of those bare markets uh in 2020 and 2022 and maybe we&#39;ve got some blue sky for maybe a few more years than people anticipate right now we definitely don&#39;t anticipate it especially on our Channel like we like we always talk look look for the negatives of course maybe because I&#39;m German as well we always look for the negatives right but uh like I don&#39;t want to say we&#39;re doom and gloom Channel but we&#39;re trying to figure out what is happening and we all know that the debt as is is not sustainable especially interest payment we need to we don&#39;t need to go into that but we&#39;re all I&#39;ll let you in on a little secret Kai uh uh Doom and Gloom gets more views so uh so if that&#39;s the goal uh I would stick with the theme good point good point no no absolutely um you you touched on it like the next topic like I really want to talk about how can we get GDP running hot again like how do we get to the 10% that Jensen W suggested and that you quoted him saying that is actually already an indication of where things might be heading is it AI is it new technology really pushing that like it seems like the US really is betting big on AI to save itself meaning like we&#39;ll have to get GDP up if we can&#39;t get debt under control we have to get GDP up to keep that ratio somewhat in check is AI Our Savior Tom I think I think it&#39;s part of the fact I think that&#39;s part of the formula I think uh we&#39;ve seen an increase in productivity but the number one thing that people don&#39;t talk enough about which really helped in Trump 1.0 is passive deregulation you know for every new regulation I think his rule is he&#39;s got to cut four old regulations and you have no idea the amount of Ingenuity and productivity that can be Unleashed when you just take the governor off the accelerator and for years uh politicians have been substantiating their existence by creating more and more regulation putting more and more Governors against growth uh and and um and and Trump is throwing that playbook out and he&#39;s going to unleash American Ingenuity and American creativity and American productivity by just letting business run and yeah some will run too far and they&#39;ll have to be corrected but he&#39;s a believer of the self-correcting mechanism of the markets and uh and and you don&#39;t need a nanny state to tell everyone what to do in every single aspect of their business certainly you have to have uh uh guide rails and uh a core set of rules but the acceleration of the regulation has just uh really hindered growth and put us at a level that um we&#39;re still a small country you know 330 million people uh certainly the largest uh uh GDP and production but I I think we could grow a lot faster if we Unleash the Beast and uh and that&#39;s what Trump did in Trump in 1.0 and we saw the results and and I think that&#39;s what we&#39;re going to see in 2.0 it&#39;s not going to be tomorrow but it&#39;s probably going to be in a few quarters you&#39;re going to start to see it and you see it in CEO confidence numbers their confidence levels in in the future outlook which were at uh very depressed levels in 2024 uh in terms of investing in terms of growth in terms of confidence uh it&#39;s and and what banks are going to be able to do in terms of lending as they start to ease up some of the uh uh restrictions on banks again so I think that people are really uh have to be careful about looking in the rear view mirror and getting caught up in recency bias meaning um thinking that what has happened in the recent past is going to persist into the future and actually zooming out and looking a little further back and see what happened during different periods of history when a different set of conditions and a different Playbook was put into play and uh and the periods of great growth and great uh economic Prosperity\n### MISCELLANEOUS\nso uh the 300 billion number is just the US mag 7 for 2025 uh the Stargate project you know um masi Yoshi came out from soft Bank talking about 200 billion I mean this guy&#39;s a cowboy he&#39;s a a cat that has nine lives I mean you know he almost blew up with Wei work and flushed a ton of investors money with that and yet the guy goes out and raises billions of dollars like it&#39;s no problem and then you know a week after he promises 200 billion he reports that the company lost some you know multi-billions that quarter alone so you can&#39;t make this stuff up but the point is is the direction okay and the direction is going to be in Investments it&#39;s going to be in capital pack is going to be in data centers deep seek was a game changer because what they said what they showed is that uh you can get similar or better results with a lot less money now the question is how much less money is it 95% is it 50% the point is it&#39;s less so it messed with all of the uh 25-year-old analysts Excel spreadsheets and uh it was like a you know mind blow and now everyone&#39;s reconfiguring and you&#39;re seeing Alibaba had a model quen 2.5 that beat both deep seek and open AI in performance on many if you know the majority of metrics and that&#39;s why you&#39;re seeing uh Alibaba go parabolic so I think there&#39;s going to be a tremendous amount of competition uh and the beauty of deep seek uh which I love is that some of their performance was garnered on inferior chips and when I think about inferior chips I say to myself who is the king of inferior chips is Intel okay so if they can generate performance on inferior chips at a much lower cost imagine the possibilities for inferior companies like Intel that are trading as if they&#39;re going out of business uh but if people seem to forget that they did over 50 billion dollar of Revenue in the last 12 months oh and by the way they&#39;re the only place you can get uh excess capacity you know the whole Nvidia story is very very simple um they have grown data center Revenue if you look at the last six eight quarters uh $4 billion do per quarter that sounds pretty unbelievable except for the fact that the base of the business has gotten much larger so that $4 billion dollar of Revenue growth each quarter uh a year or two ago uh equaled 250% Revenue growth today it&#39;s less than half of that and by the end of the year it will be less than 50% because that it&#39;s not necessarily a demand issue right now it&#39;s more of a supply issue and they are relying on the kindness of strangers and what I&#39;m trying to say is they are not the captain of their own ship they are completely dependent on Taiwan semiconductor&#39;s capacity to produce and Taiwan semiconductor is producing at or Beyond capacity right now which is why they are limited to four billion in growth I think Intel is going to be a solution for that down the road but in the meantime if you have a company trading at 30 times sales and 44 times earnings with d accelerating growth you have to be worried about that and with a CEO filing to sell more than a billion plus dollars in the last few months uh you know I don&#39;t watch what people say I watch what they do and that&#39;s why you&#39;ve seen negative returns for NVIDIA since June and most people would not guess that if you talk to the average Uber driver who&#39;s excited about Nvidia changing the world I don&#39;t know much about Nvidia person I don&#39;t follow their like I don&#39;t read the quarterly or anything like I know what they do obviously and I know but not in detail but it&#39;s like I&#39;m my gut feeling like I I love my gut feeling by the way but I&#39;ve been watching some YouTube channels about graphics card like they they came out with a new 50 Series recently and they&#39;re all negative like too expensive performance not really like where what they promised um MSRP is not achievable and then tariffs on top of it as well like an extra $50 for a graphics card which is supposed to be $579 makes a difference right so like I&#39;d be cautious like I don&#39;t own any viia it&#39;s not part of the market I own or play and but I&#39;d be cautious personally at least like for the next quarter delivery roll out doesn&#39;t seem to be great only influencers getting graphics cards right now everything&#39;s really really interesting signs if you follow that um you you touched on Taiwan I want to take it one further I want to take one Island further east and would need to talk Japan real quick um cuz that&#39;s something we briefly discussed off air and I&#39;ve been trying to fit it in um segue really is inflation in Japan like 4% um La last month and that could really derail things for everybody meaning liquidity is is uh what do you call it like on high alert for for a lack of better term because the Yen carry trade could get unraveled here rather quickly meaning if the Japanese Central Bank decides to raise interest rates the cheap money could disappear that&#39;s been propping up the US market um correct let&#39;s let&#39;s talk about that a little bit and how much of a risk do you see there well all you need to do is look at inflation numbers and look at what the uh Bank of Japan has been doing inflation has been going up and Bank of Japan has been hiking uh and they&#39;ve been trying to hold back hiking as much as they can because of what happened in August uh and they haven&#39;t been able to so they&#39;re going to continue to hike inflation&#39;s going to continue to go up why because they&#39;ve been printing money since I can remember and um and I think what&#39;s going to happen is uh that that free what most people don&#39;t realize is a lot of the um support Behind The Magnificent Seven trade one was attributable to earnings which are now decelerating uh and two was attributable to free money exactly as you hit that nail on the head Kai uh in that that is now going to shrivel up because uh as as uh the jgbs start to have higher and higher yields there&#39;s a cost of of holding that position and people are going to say well now you know when when money is free like it was in 2022 you know when the FED fund rate was a lot lower what did you see you just saw people throwing money at Venture Capital anything that had startup people were throwing money at in 2020 2021 and then 2022 the chickens came home to roost well it&#39;s not that much different with with the carry trade free money now drying up that that carry trade money wasn&#39;t going into startups it was going into mag s and I think that&#39;s going to uh be in question and certainly I&#39;m not I&#39;m not calling for any type of Correction like a lot of people say well all the concentration it&#39;s got to be like the Tech record 2000 I don&#39;t think it&#39;s going to be that I I I just think they&#39;ve had they pulled forward a lot of gains they&#39;re making a huge amount of investment so what has helped the gains well one they&#39;ve been able to buy back unlimited amounts of stock so if if you make the pieces

you need to know the Market&#39;s going to go down sometime if you&#39;re not ready for that you shouldn&#39;t own stocks and it&#39;s good when it happens if you like a stock at 14 it goes to six that&#39;s great you understand the company you look at the balance sheet and they&#39;re doing fine you hoping to get to 22 with it 14 to 22 is terrific 6 to 22 is exceptional so you take advantage of these declines they&#39;re going to happen no one knows when they&#39;re going to happen it would be very people tell you about it after the fact that they predicted it but they predicted it 53 times and uh so you can take advantage of the volatility Market if you understand what you own uh so I think that&#39;s the key the element another key element is that you have plenty of time people are an unbelievable rush to buy a stock I&#39;ll give you an example of a well-known company Walmart went public in October of 1970 1970 went public already had a great record it had 15 years performance great Bal sheet you could have waited 10 years saying you&#39;re a very conservative investor you&#39;re not sure this Walmart can make it you want to check you&#39;re you see them operate in small towns you&#39;re afraid they can only make it in seven or eight states you want to wait till they go to more States you keep waiting you can bought Walmart 10 years after they went public and made 35 times your money if you bought it when they went public you would have made 500 times your money but you going waited 10 years after wmart went public and made uh 30 over 30 times your money

MACRO_DATA_SLIDES\ninitial jobless claims in Washington DC Skyrocket that&#39;s why this if this job Department if this jobs report comes in Weak it&#39;s going to be very constructive from a market standpoint because it brings the FED back into play much sooner than ever you know just a few weeks ago everyone saiding no Cuts because of the CPI report CPI is seasonally strong in January and February uh so that&#39;s a fake out and now we get to see what&#39;s under the surface and we also got to keep a strong eye on this GDP now at negative - 2.4% for q1 that&#39;s a big deal fortunately the GDP now has been wrong of late but you know two quarters is a is a recession and I think that that is low probability right now with 18% earnings growth and I think the numbers of uh uh at ATA fed are probably wrong again but you have to pay attention and keep keep your biases aside and deal with the facts and so far credit spreads are saying uh their numbers are probably wrong uh us initial jobless claims hit highest okay DC we got that bond yields going down we&#39;ve been expecting that that&#39;s happened uh cap backs we&#39;ve covered pening holds uh inflows into Europe everyone&#39;s chasing up so maybe we&#39;ll have some problems with the European bonds and that&#39;ll shake up their market and we&#39;ll see some flows we&#39;ll we&#39ll we&#39ll pay attention to that record outflow from crypto so a lot of um a lot of risk on stuff showing some some fear uh here&#39;s Seth golden with the a aii bull bear spread you can see uh when it gets this extreme um you know year out 6 months out on average you&#39;re up 133% 20 uh a year later you&#39;re up 22% this is international stocks second best month versus US stocks in the last 15 years by the way 15 years every 10 to 15 years it&#39;s it flips from us to International doesn&#39;t mean the international that us does bad it just means International does better what else we got here big rotation from mag 7 to China battic we talked about this tremendous 10 these are going straight up those are coming down they&#39;re going to meet in the middle and then China&#39;s going to exceed it just like China dramatically outperformed and then they caught caught up and one caught up and one caught down we&#39;re going to see mag 7 catch down and Chinese stocks catch up led by which Ali effen Baba bull markets last longer than you think we&#39;re only at 60 the average is 67 months we are only at 28 months so we&#39;re halfway there uh Living on a Prayer and uh there we go uh Europe stocks breaking out this looks pretty healthy even if you get a pullback uh probably a deal with zalinski is what uh what&#39;s what set what sets that up number of unsold completed homes for sale eye on the housing markets you&#39;re seeing a lot of weakness in Florida houses inventory is super high prices being cut 10 20% that is often a precursor for other frothy areas around the country uh so we&#39;ll keep an eye out on that and I will have a front row seat in Orange County we shall see as the chin marginal CH uh Chinese dollar stops flowing in because fomo is happening in China with everything starting to go up um you know maybe we will see some some opportunities abound uh here as well big Tech big decline we got that um this is another analog for the first year of the presidential cycle again some weakness in late February through mid-march and then straight up into summer so there&#39;s the dollar Index just rolling over uh what else do we have here that the Atlanta fed GDP keeping an eye on that Euro Zone loans to households so credit expansion is starting to happen in Europe to businesses as well PMI manufacturing back in expansion in China mag 7 so again I think we&#39;re back down here probably get a technical bounce here so for those of you who really like those stocks probably get a little bit of bargain for us the margin of safety even at these discounted levels is not where we want to see it but they definitely will probably work as a trade for many of you that like to do that stuff it&#39;s not what we do uh let&#39;s see S&P companies outperforming year on year uh this type of acceleration of breath uh is is um is very healthy and it&#39;s actually what we saw in when 2001 when small cap value and international dramatically outperformed even though there was some weakness short-term weakness in the economy and Tech got smashed ### HEADLINES_AND_NEWS\nother periods where you saw this was the second term of trump where well again a second term of Reagan where again International outperformed domestic as we saw the chart earlier Friday&#39;s advancing volume second highest since uh covid 202&#39;s Market recovery interesting uh uh I don&#39;t know why okay uh here we go dollar rolling over oh this is interesting the EU Aerospace and defense index up dramatically relative to the mag7 index a lot of things are up relative it&#39;s it&#39;s not hard to beat 7.7% if you go to mag which is the mag 7 ETF it&#39;s down 7.7% maybe a little more by the close 10year yield down for seven straight weeks remember at 480 everyone was calling for five and I said three handle before five handle and uh we may not see a five handle before Trump is out of office so um that&#39;s that Goldman Sachs top down S&P 500 forecast we talk about guidance coming down home affordability is the lowest it&#39;s been since 20067 8 that doesn&#39;t mean we&#39;re going to have a housing crisis but I do think we are going to have some normalization of prices probably somewhat offset by lower mortgage rates creating demand so it&#39;ll be a wash and that affordability will go up as the cost of ownership goes down you know if you take a 10year from 480 down to 350 and you get 30-year fix rates at 5.5 the affordability from 7 two which it was a week ago not a week ago a month ago for a 30-year fix down to 55 uh you know that&#39;s huge that cuts 25 30% off the monthly payment and uh even if uh prices come down 10% I think you&#39;re going to see huge demand bids so not a housing crisis but an opportunity in the making except where there&#39;s super froth you know there&#39;s some areas where houses doubled after Co then doubled again uh those I could getting hit 30% may you know uh but we&#39;ll see chop frustration is normal we got that uh shortterm sentiment extremely pessimistic that&#39;s just another indicator pointing to a technical bounce here in coming days and weeks put volume second highest Spike of all time um you know so that tends to be a contrarian indicator large caps to small caps S&P 500 uh divided by Russell 2000 haven&#39;t seen it since 2001 I think you are going to see a ripy face off rally in small caps once we get through this tariff noise and going into the close I do think that Trump was saying that he likes the president of Mexico or something and uh he&#39;s going to back off on certain things I you know it&#39;s dayto day welcome to Trump 2.0 same as Trump 1.0 another day another headline another volatility and it resolves to the upside so uh just uh enjoy enjoy the show ladies and gentlemen growth of okay so that&#39;s that uh bull bear spread we covered crowded and cracking it was momentum and it&#39;s getting smashed I think uh paler was down another 10% or 8% today uh mag seven earnings reminder decelerating uh unmagnify accelerating that&#39;s why the opportunities are going to be in the UNM magnificent 493 and uh coming out of the mag even if you get this technical bounce so uh I it&#39;ll be interesting to see when they get this bounce in the next few weeks how many people chase up when they get near back near the top of the recent range and then they get smacked again but uh time will tell uh 50% of stocks outperforming the S&P 500 up from just 30% last year this is what we saw last when 2001 what happened then regime change International outperformed value outperformed growth International outperformed domestic F value outperform growth small cap outperform large cap ### MISCELLANEOUS\nI continue to repeat this because it continues to not be believed and even as

previous seven days from uh you know just a small percentage of the research that we do that goes into the portfolios Etc and\n\n### ASK_ME_ANYTHING_QA\nquestions  for everyone who likes that part of our weekly show we're excited to cover that here so let's kick it off with Josh Jacobson thank you for the great work you do every week your consistency is on Match I want to get your opinion on Arista networks uh okay so he said valuation still looks a little Rich does it make sense to get into a great business even if the valuation is a little Rich no why would you get into where the valuation is Rich uh it's not the only stock in the market but let's see if that analysis is accurate uh I'm probably 90% chance I'm going to agree with you on that just pass wait till it comes to you and if it doesn't forget fomo or if it takes off without you so what uh this definitely looks like it's ready to bounce on a technical basis along with the mag 7 and many others so um if you're a Trader then you know have at it if you're an investor let's see what we're looking at here um here we go okay I forgot to turn this back that is default we like to zoom out here at hedge fund tips with Tom Hayes and not get caught up in the daily noise uh no way how's it save you time uh this is a stock that's up you know 30X in a handful of years it's got to rest this looks like a broken momentum stock and uh where you're going to get faked out is the fundamentals are going to come back down quicker well I mean this is this is kind of fascinating I I wouldn't be a buyer here I just just wait for a while and if you miss it you miss it um and I think you already know that so kudos to you from being a loyal listener not chasing shiny objects at the top and let other people be the bag holders on that JT investor could you shed some light on what caused vfc to drop this week uh the Market's going down people are overleveraged and they're getting smoked and nothing's changed in the fundamental uh plan and execution of Brack and Daryl um and uh and by the way if we zoom out I'll bet you can't even see it let's see VF Corp yeah so it's gone straight up for like three straight months it's going to correct and consolidate that's what they do that's what they do every single cycle straight up correct consolidate huge run straight up correct consolidate for here it was a year and then straight up so uh relax next Patrick B what's your take on the IT consulting service base I've never liked it uh gft Technologies and the reason I've never liked it is because your assets go down the elevator every day um so let's see gft Technologies um I you know I I don't like these businesses so I'm going to just pass Mark Callaway uh says hey Tom and thank you for all that you do not lip service truly thank you I know you say it's a great time to pick individual stocks but do you have a preferred ETF to put my adult kids in that are brand new to investing uh so many I've looked at are heavy on the mag 7 uh I would do a combination you know do some us vti is less concentrated in the uh mag 7 and then uh vxus uh xus it's a good place to start with those two if you just want to pass it for the long term maybe some Emerging Markets uh and maybe some small c cap so iwm would be small cap Emerging Markets would be uh vwo or um e and um that's opinion not advice but a great question thanks for listening iore Barry thoughts on Porsche uh we do not M we do not buy car makers we buy part suppliers Daniel Borman what is your th thought on Ray Doo's warning that a US debt crisis could trigger a heart attack in the next three years um let's see Ray Dio crash okay so he said uh three days ago we're going to crash he said let's see market crash basically every two years um look anyway the point is the guy made a lot of money and uh he's effectively a bond commodity guy by training and these guys are always negative and the beauty of that is they get a ton of money because t\n\nVF Corp yeah so it's gone straight up for like three straight months it's going to correct and consolidate that's what they do that's what they do every single cycle straight up correct

Daniel Borman what is your th thought on Ray Doo's warning that a US debt crisis could trigger a heart attack in the next three years um let's see Ray Dio crash okay so he said uh three days ago we're going to crash he said let's see market crash basically every two years um look anyway the point is the guy made a lot of money and uh he's effectively a bond commodity guy by training and these guys are always negative and the beauty of that is they get a ton of money because there is  more AUM in debt instruments than t\n\nin credit because they don&#39;t want to take Equity risk and um and that&#39;s that so look uh if you Google you will see every two years he says the Market&#39;s going to crash and the fact of the matter is um he was right in 2008 and he made a ton of money and um and you really only have to be right once or twice in life to make a fortune whether that&#39;s in buying businesses building businesses picking a wife uh you don&#39;t have to be right a million times and uh nor should everyone anyone expect people to be right I mean at the end of the day the guy made 14 billion so so what if he made a few bad calls he made one or two right ones and uh and he made a fortune so I wouldn&#39;t worry about that uh he&#39;s going to be right again at some point I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s in three years or three months or or 20 years but um the message has been consistent let&#39;s just leave it at that Luca Milo thanks for the amazing content every week I share it with everyone that&#39;s interested in financial markets and they started following you too thank you very much uh what do you think leged plat uh it&#39;s a Furniture maker so it&#39;s going to be in the short term going to be hurt I think that uh it did have some balance sheet risk but uh you know it&#39;s in a big downtrend I mean the number one thing you need to do on this company is solvency risk but I think this could wind up being an interesting if not trade investment uh but this is the type of thing where i&#39; I&#39;d probably have to go understand the business really really carefully before so it looks like they&#39;ve got $350 million of cash and how much debt uh two billion so or 1.8 billion so you got to see when all that comes due uh you got to see what they&#39;re generating in terms of this is this is the issue uh let&#39;s see here cash from operations no cash from operations is not bad 305 million uh free cash flow 224 million so you just have to do the math [Music] on see cash from financing cash interest paid 84 million you just have to see when all these come to but I like the idea I definitely like the idea Luca and it&#39;s probably worth some more work ### ASK_ME_ANYTHING_QA\nokay we got that okay this one is from Grayson Harris what sort of path in the finance industry would you recommend college students who enjoy value investing what sort of firm environment would your college grad be able to prosper in a solid value investor without going off on their own number one you can&#39;t you can try to go off on your own but uh uh I I&#39;m going to repeat it I would never suggest taking other people&#39;s money to manage until you have proven that you don&#39;t need any money because you&#39;ve made enough money in markets for yourself and you&#39;ve gone through two or three Cycles working for someone else um and proven that you have lived through enough cycles and you know what you&#39;re doing before you take on that enormous responsibility um because if you do it wrong and you do it early you will not recover uh and um I I don&#39;t I don&#39;t even say that remotely lightly that&#39;s uh you know serious is a heart attack with that advice um and then what what skills do you hone through value investing that are transferable to other sectors I think it&#39;s you know the the language of numbers is critical for any and all businesses as a matter of fact uh I I think it&#39;s critical if you&#39;re in school and you can take accounting courses and you can take finance courses I would say that your odds of success in being an entrepreneur and starting a business are much higher than your odds of success in as an investor and the people who do investing well uh make it look a lot easier than it is because for every word that comes out of their mouth there&#39;s probably 75 thoughts and uh historical Frameworks that are running in in the background that you don&#39;t know and can&#39;t understand without living through 20 plus years of markets so um that&#39;s number one number two um it&#39;s a lot more competitive than you think uh you know you&#39;re going against the smartest you know smart quot smartest students in the world smartest you know people got the highest grades and all all of that stuff so it&#39;s not a walk in the park I mean I if you absolutely love it and it&#39;s what you do you know if you if you wound up at another job and like all night long all you&#39;re doing is studying stocks and you don&#39;t go to bed till you get to your job and like it&#39;s what you love then it&#39;s probably what you should do but if it&#39;s like oh that&#39;s where I should go to make money because I can make more money ah huge huge life mistake uh you won&#39;t be able to compete with people who love to do it 247 uh and you&#39;ll get you&#39;ll get smoked out um so my B best suggestion in your 20s is you don&#39;t have to be a genius you just have to be persistent and consistent and you could build a business that&#39;ll make you so much more money uh before you&#39;re 30 than you would ever make in the finance uh industry um but if you play the turtle hair game you know having the skill of being a a great investor uh when all is said and done by the time you&#39;re 50 uh you know the scales tip and and you got compounding in the rearview mirror and you might might wind up uh a lot further ahead but you really have to love it I would go to youtube.com under the hedge fund tips Channel and put in the search bar University of Bristol I did an hour interview with their investor Club on uh my suggestions if you do want to get into the business um it&#39;s a narrower opening than it was 20 years ago um when regulations were easy and anyone and their mother could start a hedge fund uh in the early 2000s and that all changed when the rules changed uh so it&#39;s a lot more expensive much higher barriers of Entry a lot fewer startups um but uh but also I like that because um it it creates a it creates a moat so uh or a small moat if you&#39;re really good at it and you love it uh so the short answer to your question is if you love it go for it you&#39;ll figure it out if you are just doing it because it looks like an easy way to make money uh absolutely do not go in this direction uh go build a business or or go work for someone first [Music] um I think there&#39;s so many unbelievable opportunities to make a ton of money as an entrepreneur nowadays with all the platforms available to you and all the ways to reach markets that have never existed if you have a good idea go for it and you may fail in two or three businesses in your 20s that&#39;s perfectly normal as an entrepreneur uh in finance you can&#39;t do that you can&#39;t blow up a fund and expect to ever come back I mean people do it but it&#39;s the exception not the rule so that&#39;s that you know on a business you can just rebound and do it again and do it again most entrepreneurs probably fail two or three times before they have their big big hit that would probably be an exciting way to live if if you don&#39;t know if you love investing uh but um but that&#39;s that uh Michael silver Tidewater I just go with Slumber Jay if you have to or um yeah this was obviously delution at some point I I I don&#39;t like that one even rig I don&#39;t like I I would just go up the food chain and go to something like SLB or HP or uh noov if you have to be in the space and you can&#39;t resist that that&#39;s probably more where I would be interested um but I don&#39;t have to so I won&#39;t uh moving on Christopher Williams block not interested we like PayPal I knew no David Martin Philip uh do you have a preference between Bungie or ADM uh I would go for Archer Daniels Midland RCI what is this thing is this a cable operator yeah Communications company wireless cable and media internet access I mean this is kind of like the Comcast story they all look interesting here um I think this probably could this will probably wind up working but uh I would definitely do some work on it here but if you&#39;re totally right you&#39;re going to get a double and I I don&#39;t think it&#39;s a good enough business to take that risk and I don&#39;t like I don&#39;t need to be totally right I like things that I can be half wrong and still make a triple in a few years so uh it&#39;s not for me Kyle Burns uh if you were the CEO of Advanced Auto Parts would you be doing something different than Chanel Kelly or do you feel that he&#39;s doing exact same way you would do things or is there room for improvement I I literally wouldn&#39;t change one thing that Shane o&#39; Kelly is doing as a matter of fact he&#39;s doing a better job than I would and that&#39;s why he&#39;s going to wind up with probably a triple if not more uh and that&#39;s why I just pick the jockeys versus having to implement the execution uh because I pick people who can do it better it&#39;s the same way it&#39;s the same reason that people are who are you know sentim Millionaires and billionaires pick me to manage their money it&#39;s not because they couldn&#39;t learn it and do it it&#39;s because they&#39;re already rich so they&#39;re going to delegate to someone who specialized that they don&#39;t do it all day for 20 years uh and just like I&#39;m going to delegate to Shane o Kelly who&#39;s been doing this stuff for three decades between Home Depot Supply and other successful runs uh and you can hear his whole interview and Brack and Daryl from Old Spice days to Logitech to Proctor and Gamble I mean these guys that&#39;s all they&#39;ve done for decades so I&#39;m going to delegate the execution to them because they&#39;re going to be the best out of it&#39;s not because you know Shane o Kelly is 10 IQ points higher than Tom Hayes therefore he&#39;s doing a better job it&#39;s because that&#39;s all he does uh and and and so on and so forth so the more successful people you meet the more you will realize that they delegate more than you would ever imagine doing you the things that you could do are different than the things you should do the good is the enemy the better is the enemy of the best if you are not doing your highest and best value and you&#39;re not delegate and you&#39;re not delegating you&#39;re doing a disservice to the world so I&#39;m at a stage now where I&#39;m delegating everything that&#39;s not picking stocks or interacting with clients the things that I do best uh everything else is has been effectively delegated now more or less I&#39;d say I&#39;m if I&#39;m not 80% there I&#39;m 80 90% there and all I have to think about nowadays is um picking stocks which is what I love to do which is my highest and best use because you you you don&#39;t outperform by consensus any of the best funds in the world it&#39;s one or two people and usually one person making all the decisions and then they have support staff to get everything else done and operations and excellence and all of that stuff um uh and by the way that was the case for for diio by the way uh and uh I know his number two extremely well played poker with him for 10 years and um they made effectively all the decisions even though they had a thousand people they had a thousand bodies why because when pensions come in to see you uh they have this metric and the more bodies you have in seats doing busy work the bigger the check they&#39;re allowed to write you so if you want you know $200 million from a pension fund you better have 50 people sitting in seats uh whether they&#39;re doing anything or not is immaterial uh it just it just pays to pay them a salary to sit there so you can get a bigger check from a pension I&#39;m not in that game I&#39;ve never optimized for maximum a I&#39;ve always optimized for quality of life doing what I love and making sure that every single partner I have every investor is someone that I enjoy respect and would hang out with whether or not we did business and if I meet that I live happy life they live a happy life everything&#39;s good and if I optimize for AUM and I start dealing with 12-year olds with clipboards counting the number bodies and seeds it takes me away from doing what I do best which is picking stocks so uh that&#39;s how I&#39;ve decided to live my life and it works great for me ### ASK_ME_ANYTHING_QA\num okay so uh David okay thoughts on docu or valet doy sign I I I don&#39;t really have an interest in this I I I don&#39;t all right let&#39;s try valet valet will probably work for a trade but I mean you&#39;re lucky to make a double if everything goes right so uh for me no but I think valy is ready to go Nick thank you for all your wisdom and help with things in stock market I&#39;m an avid listener every week over here in the UK want to ask your thought about Powell Industries uh okay P WL thank you by the way for all of the Avid listeners and particularly those folks uh no no this was a 20 bagger it&#39;s a broken momentum stock I don&#39;t want to buy it up here regardless of how good the fundamentals look now because the stock is telling me that the fundamentals are probably going to deteriorate pretty quickly so uh for me that&#39;s a pass ### ASK_ME_ANYTHING_QA\num David [Music] Gavin look at Denny&#39;s ah these are tough I mean we&#39;re over restaured here in the US all this is is a debt story let&#39;s take a look at the balance sheet here because question is is whether this thing why is the cash so low these numbers have to be wrong if these numbers are right Run for the hills I think these numbers are wrong says they got $3 million of cash and uh $261 million of debt um I don&#39;t know that that can be right let&#39;s see what their free cash flow is this this is this is not for me I mean it looks like it wants to bounce from a trading perspective for sure and it is a legacy brand but uh that&#39;s just going to go in my to Hard Box uh Alex CK Hutchinson Holdings Hong Kong I will not buy any Chinese stock other than Alibaba and if I had to buy one or two more it would be ba and 10 cent uh I I won&#39;t buy any midcaps or small caps I&#39;m not taking country and Company risk I mean our our original thesis with ba baba was if if uh if Baba goes down so does China I mean that&#39;s basically what it comes down to so uh I&#39;ve seen too many frauds in China over the years I&#39;ve seen people get burned by frauds in China every cycle I won&#39;t I mean no way I mean Alibaba has been stress tested over and over there are tons of outs I&#39;m not going to play in other stock so you know if you want a lagard in China because everything else has moved up if I had to take buy put a ton of new money to work in China and I didn&#39;t want to chase up baba uh I&#39;d probably start to take a hard look at Buu um and that&#39;ll be a a lower quality but catch up but as far as betting on like obscure stocks that I have no Edge uh hard pass because we&#39;re going to pull up the numbers they&#39;re going to look great and then there&#39;s a coin flip chance in nine months it turns out to be a fraud and there&#39;s nothing like uh you can do about it you have no Edge ### HEADLINES_AND_NEWS\nJames sent me a nice article in the Ft you can probably check out uh it says investors should be worry of analyst ratings you know and I make the joke of how Morgan Stanley downgraded China and Alibaba at $70 and now they&#39;re upgrading it at $140 so uh this article kind of embodies that and it&#39;s not just Morgan Stanley and it&#39;s not just China it happens over and over and over when the stock is down they all downgrade in the hole when the stock is up they all upgrade at the top uh and that&#39;s and that&#39;s the name of the game so analysts are now flipping on Baba because you know the price has doubled up plus uh but it&#39;s just the beginning they will start to come in herds and after it gets over 200 everyone will be upgrading and you know when it&#39;s beyond that you will see everyone uniformly uh bullish uh in the 200s with price targets over 300 and that&#39;s when you have to start to look carefully at fundamentals but we&#39;re nowhere near that point ### HEADLINES_AND_NEWS\nfour years this is from Matt in North Carolina four years of listening to the best content available on the internet never miss thank you thank you I appreciate your loyal support Trump suggests get rid of the chips during his speech Taiwan semiconductor going to build foundaries in the US I mean good luck and Boeing is going to build planes for Southwest get in line for 25 years I mean if Taiwan semiconductor starts today they&#39;re going to have to go through 10 of billions like Intel already did four to six years uh before they even have a chance and uh and by then the AI Revolution is long in the tooth so uh Intel&#39;s going to be the beneficiary whether they partner with Taiwan semiconductor to have Taiwan semiconductor operate I wouldn&#39;t bet on it um and I would fire the board and I would bring Ginger back but more likely than not they will bring some big name in and they&#39;ll get the job done and ginger will get no credit even though he did 90% of the work uh and the new face will get all the credit and go to the promised land so sometimes in life better to be lucky than to be good that will be the next CEO of Intel Griffin Brown uh Cooper standard uh you mentioned Paris companies like Coop sandard will not move plans to the US to save money recently I&#39;ve been seeing many\n\n### HEADLINES_AND_NEWS\nheadlines about companies mainly vehicle moving plans to the US due to tariffs what are your thoughts um this has been happening for years some some you know Toyota builds cars in Tennessee I mean the the oems will probably do it will the part suppliers I mean a lot of this is also going to be symbolic to appease the the administration and make the administration look like they're doing the things that they said they're going to do but to invest material amounts of money for three and a half years and by the time the factory is done there's a new Administration in and your competitors are going to be going offshore for cheaper Labor uh you will see it's a cost benefit analysis okay so if they think that they're going to save money on tariffs by building a few factories in the US they will do that uh but they also is time value of money and you're talking about a three and a half year window so it's going to be the headlines are going to be more than you think the reality is going to be less than you think and at the end of the day you still have the average car on the road 13.5 years you still have the bulk of the population at 34 when they all move out to the suburbs have a kid and buy a second car um that's not going to change if the price of uh a piece of rubber goes from you know $190 a car to $210 a car and your MSRP goes from you know $50,000 to $50,000 20 because the rubber got more expensive it it really is is immaterial you know if you're selling Transmissions maybe that's a different story if your part goes from 7,000 to uh 8,500 you might have a problem but if it goes from you know 190 to 2110 it's like it's it's a rounding error and it's going to be passed through to the oems and then through the customers but also if interest rates go down and then you have tax deductibility on the auto loan uh that's a big deal that's a big deal\n### ASK_ME_ANYTHING_QA\nBill McGrew thanks for doing such a great podcast I never miss it wondering what your thought of APA a little cheaper than com stock on a Enterprise Value to free cash flow that is not a metric you would use for an energy company you're looking at proved and improved reserves value um I think it's uh I think apache's okay and I think that uh Comstock has more upside on a multiple basis so we're already at uh double and a half on uh 2 and a half X on comto resources I wouldn't bet on aache even being a double and I think Comstock is going to probably uh double again from here so that'll be like four 5x and um not will not be the case with Apache if you're lucky with aache you'll be up 50% so I would just uh leave it at that that's that's not the way you value this type of company but uh longtime listener can you look at halberton yeah I like halberton better than I like Tidewater um let's just put that in here but I think you you know I think you're taking some kind of risk for a maximum maximum double uh it's it's not that it's not terribly exciting for me but yeah if you want energy exposer it's probably okay uh okay statman emailed in from linta the wonderful high school that I had the pleasure to speak with a few weeks back uh nope that's not his let's see what note did he say no that's the old stuff okay well what he was saying was that his students were doing having a great time listening to it and I'm very grateful that they've stuck with it and I hope it makes a difference for a handful of them that uh go on to have incredible careers and uh do great things Bill C thanks for all you do to help us retail

I&#39;m going to pass uh uh let&#39;s see here we have a lot of questions  this week which is great Jimmy Jones when do you suspect ant group IPO uh probably in the next year would be my best guess if not sooner uh we own 35% of it so uh it probably adds initially 2030 billion and then over time probably 100 B billion dollars worth of value that&#39;s not in the stock uh David McLean Gregs g r e g GS uh that&#39;s interesting I think it&#39;s a fast food chain so cash flow has been deteriorating for two straight years while revenue&#39;s been going up margins are going down so just tell me how they&#39;re going to turn this around why are margins down uh how much is a stock down about 40% what&#39;s the balance sheet look like half a billion of leases let&#39;s cash look like what&#39;s the Share account doing looks like they&#39;re expanding they&#39;re probably investing in a lot of new stories is my guess uh where&#39;s the share count yeah I mean this thing looks at first blush is definitely worth more work I think you&#39;re probably okay here or near here uh you know 1500 I&#39;d be probably a lot more interested, 1600 but I I think if you&#39;re longterm you&#39;re probably going to be okay but I don&#39;t know the business so you got to really understand the business like is there something wrong with the business has it fallen out of fashion or is it just a normal cyclical trough um what is it Gregs food on the go retailer in the UK Kingdom you United Kingdom let&#39;s see what they sell okay accept all cookies Craigs nation&#39;s favorite sausage roll uh oh it&#39;s like a fast casual yeah I mean the numbers look okay I I don&#39;t really have an edge here but it generally spes the smell test and would be warranted to do a lot more work before making a material position but uh I you know it&#39;s if you&#39;re 100% right you you have probably a maximum of a double and it&#39;s going to take you a few years which is okay uh hi Tom I&#39;m following

bottom process",
    "TECHNICAL_CHARTS": "\n\nMarket taking a little bit of a breather uh I think we're getting close to that bounce and here's what he's looking at you know basically in the uh first year you get into that 10 11 12 weeks we should be getting a bounce here retest we're kind of in this Zone here before we get a monster rally going into effectively the summer before peeking out that's kind of the the model next year will'll be a little more Rocky depending on where you are in the market but uh I think we're going to make a lot of hay while the sunshines here and I'm very very excited and and took advantage uh as we said this week with vanney and I think uh in coming weeks we're going to be a lot higher than we were on the day of that interview so you can see here on the daily kind of getting oversold here uh 10year yield completely rolled over we'll get a little bit of a bounce here I'm sure oversold bounce just like I think we'll get an oversold bounce in mag 7 so you know uh um ### TECHNICAL_CHARTS\nNvidia down almost a third now since we published that article in June uh and we'll get a 10-point bounce and people will say oh this is great blah blah blah uh but you know for all the reasons we've covered in previous podcasts I I think these things are going to be in a Range Consulting a lot a lot of gains for a long period of time and there's going to be a ton of money made Elsewhere on to the charts of the week so want to cover these this I thought was interesting the Commodities to equities ratio versus the US dollar um and you can see here the um different trade weighted index uh and how Commodities are at a bottom like we saw in when 20201 and prior to that in Reagan's second turn term before Commodities turned up and some of the overvalued pockets normalized this is the key to the market the 10-year bond yield that's the chart that you should be looking at every day not Donald Trump's tweets about this tariff or that tariff that's just a sideshow that's got everyone distracted from the real focus at uh heart here which is the carry trade unwind and uh if it if it relates to owning Tech uh are tariffs important yes but you have to keep in mind you know these are not 25% compounded at 10% a year this is a oneoff level up uh uh not compounded every year so it's just going to be a tax on the poor that's effectively what it is if it goes through and I would not make that bet uh I think what you're going to find is some compromise and somewhere in the middle and the market will be relieved and it will move forward just like it does that's why you see in this in the uh first year after the election that January through March early March period gets extremely volatile because the market likes certainty they don't care if the policy is good or bad they just care that they know what it is so they know what the rules of the game are and once Wall Street knows the rules of the game then they get on with making money because that's what Wall Street does this is a chart from the uh from Lou basanes via Charlie Bello and we've covered this many times but it's critically important to understand because people are so stooped in recency bias uh from the zero interest rate policy period that favored uh mag 7 and stocks trading at 10 times sales and all the things that uh uh were were frothy and you can see going back you know 40 50 some odd years every every 10 years it just switches back and forward from us outperformance to International outperformance from us performance to International outperformance which you saw in the second term of Reagan us outperformance International outperformance Etc and this time will be no different we have started a period here uh in recent months of uh us out performance and if this was updated we'd probably start to see the red with International dramatic outperformance um as a matter of fact the spread between mag 7 and the tremendous 10 top internet Giants is 42% of outperformance year to date with mag 7 down uh 7.7 and the tremendous 10 up some 35% uh here's Matt Sur minaro uh oversold vix one month minus vix three months is usually where you get a bounce we agree we're going to show you a bunch of things that point to a bounce in coming weeks and I and I do think we're going to wind up higher a couple weeks out uh than we are now and a and maybe a lot higher this shows some of the stuffing taken out in the last few days uh last La you know year-to dat Amazon down probably at this point down 19 20% uh Microsoft probably 20% Google over 20% ### TECHNICAL_CHARTS\nNvidia closer to 30% maybe now uh Bitcoin probably 30% Palante tier I think was down another 10% today so probably 40% uh maybe 45% uh coinbase that's probably down 50% this was La at the end of last week that he put out these numbers Tesla's probably 50% Etc so um fcoin shockingly down 89% it may be down 95% now and uh that's how it goes here's again just to reminder when you guys feel bumps in the road the next couple of weeks uh just know that this is exactly the playbook for postelection cycle years uh and then get ready buckle up we're going straight up through the summer and and and no one's going to know what hit them and whether you look at this one or you look at Ned Davis research this is just a composite going all the way back uh in this case uh where does he start this data I know most of them are going going back to 1955 um here's uh home builders we want to be looking for buyers as rates come down the the big play that everyone's going to be surprised about is I think home builders will come back but I'd rather play it through the leverage on The Leverage which is uh the Stanley Black and& Decker the generx of the world uh the suppliers that are going to be monsters as rates go down and uh same thing with the car I don't want the Builders of the homes I want the ones that Supply the Builders of the homes I don't want the automakers I want the suppliers of the automakers like Cooper standard and uh we're going to cover some really interesting things that President Trump said in his uh address this to Congress this week about car loans so we'll just keep that Cliffhanger going um and you can see Microsoft's evaluation tracking the 10year real Bond yield inversely uh this is just another way of saying that as yields go up the multiple on Microsoft y Japanese bond yields go up the yield the the multiple paid on Microsoft goes down and they're talking about tariffs to explain why us-based company tech companies are down which makes zero sense uh but that's why you tune in here to get the scoop and to set yourself up for Success dividend players jump to a 2.5 month High versus non-payers we love the dividend payers and all the type of stocks we've talked about uh are are going to benefit from that and many in the whether it's Health Care with the backers whether it's the Stanley Black and Decker dividend Aristocrat type stock you want to have exposure margin debt Rises to 2021 levels well on the one hand that implies that you get a tech wreck like you had in 2022 we've already kind of had it 20% maybe we'll have a little bit more uh in those overvalued Pockets but I do think they're getting close to a technical bounce area and I do think that they will trade in a range for some time bouncing around while other things outperform but what this doesn't account for is the fact that the value of the market is much higher than it was so the the margin debt as a percentage is still lower but I get the point they're trying to make it's just not scaled correctly southbound February buying the most since early 2021 uh so that was a a very positive period for Chinese stocks average price move in the so you can see here on average Mondays and Fridays have been the weakest uh since for for 2025 and then going all the way back to 1928 Mondays have always been the weakest uh with you know Fridays coming in a close second so my guess is we probably do turn around Tuesday however we do have the jobs report tomorrow that could be a catalyst if it comes in week from all the layoffs in Washington then uh maybe you could see expectations for a Fed cut coming in earlier than June and if it's really bad this month is on the table for the FED not probabilistic but from a nonp possibility to a possibility that's going to impact interest rates which is going to impact car loans which is going to impact mortgages which is going to impact the ability for the US to refinance boatloads of debt at lower rates uh some of this uh chaos may be less by accident and more by Design than originally thought so what are we keeping our eyes on Japanese government bond yields followed by European bond yields pay close attention because if those blow out number one you're going to have the ECB cutting okay so that's stimulative that already number two you have uncertainty like 2011 because they have high debt to GDP and they still uh the structurally set up in a very fragile way the way that they are unable to uh issue Bonds in the same way that the U us can um creates complications so we saw that in 2011 if fear about that shows up then there will be a further and stronger bid into us treasuries and that's potentially where we get the three handle on the 10year which again no one's bingo card except the incredible amazing listeners of hedge fun tips with Tom Hayes so uh you see this stuff lots of bears for stocks near new high okay this is Market concentration as it's ever been share of the top five companies by market cap in the S&P 500 so look these are historically unsustainable and all that means is it's going to be a rotation out of what's concentrated and into what's unconcentrated and that doesn't necessarily uh imply a crash uh of the indices it can be a a rotation with those stalling out and others picking up as their earnings growth accelerates and as the concentrated numbers decelerate so theme over and over now playing out in real time um most of the world is is surprised and no one",
    "HEADLINES_AND_NEWS": "\n\n### MACRO_DATA_SLIDES\ninitial jobless claims in Washington DC Skyrocket that&#39;s why this if this job Department if this jobs report comes in Weak it&#39;s going to be very constructive from a market standpoint because it brings the FED back into play much sooner than ever you know just a few weeks ago everyone saiding no Cuts because of the CPI report CPI is seasonally strong in January and February uh so that&#39;s a fake out and now we get to see what&#39;s under the surface and we also got to keep a strong eye on this GDP now at negative - 2.4% for q1 that&#39;s a big deal fortunately the GDP now has been wrong of late but you know two quarters is a is a recession and I think that that is low probability right now with 18% earnings growth and I think the numbers of uh uh at ATA fed are probably wrong again but you have to pay attention and keep keep your biases aside and deal with the facts and so far credit spreads are saying uh their numbers are probably wrong uh us initial jobless claims hit highest okay DC we got that bond yields going down we&#39;ve been expecting that that&#39;s happened uh cap backs we&#39;ve covered pening holds uh inflows into Europe everyone&#39;s chasing up so maybe we&#39;ll have some problems with the European bonds and that&#39;ll shake up their market and we&#39;ll see some flows we&#39;ll we&#39ll we&#39ll pay attention to that record outflow from crypto so a lot of um a lot of risk on stuff showing some some fear uh here&#39;s Seth golden with the a aii bull bear spread you can see uh when it gets this extreme um you know year out 6 months out on average you&#39;re up 133% 20 uh a year later you&#39;re up 22% this is international stocks second best month versus US stocks in the last 15 years by the way 15 years every 10 to 15 years it&#39;s it flips from us to International doesn&#39;t mean the international that us does bad it just means International does better what else we got here big rotation from mag 7 to China battic we talked about this tremendous 10 these are going straight up those are coming down they&#39;re going to meet in the middle and then China&#39;s going to exceed it just like China dramatically outperformed and then they caught caught up and one caught up and one caught down we&#39;re going to see mag 7 catch down and Chinese stocks catch up led by which Ali effen Baba bull markets last longer than you think we&#39;re only at 60 the average is 67 months we are only at 28 months so we&#39;re halfway there uh Living on a Prayer and uh there we go uh Europe stocks breaking out this looks pretty healthy even if you get a pullback uh probably a deal with zalinski is what uh what&#39;s what set what sets that up number of unsold completed homes for sale eye on the housing markets you&#39;re seeing a lot of weakness in Florida houses inventory is super high prices being cut 10 20% that is often a precursor for other frothy areas around the country uh so we&#39;ll keep an eye out on that and I will have a front row seat in Orange County we shall see as the chin marginal CH uh Chinese dollar stops flowing in because fomo is happening in China with everything starting to go up um you know maybe we will see some some opportunities abound uh here as well big Tech big decline we got that um this is another analog for the first year of the presidential cycle again some weakness in late February through mid-march and then straight up into summer so there&#39;s the dollar Index just rolling over uh what else do we have here that the Atlanta fed GDP keeping an eye on that Euro Zone loans to households so credit expansion is starting to happen in Europe to businesses as well PMI manufacturing back in expansion in China mag 7 so again I think we&#39;re back down here probably get a technical bounce here so for those of you who really like those stocks probably get a little bit of bargain for us the margin of safety even at these discounted levels is not where we want to see it but they definitely will probably work as a trade for many of you that like to do that stuff it&#39;s not what we do uh let&#39;s see S&P companies outperforming year on year uh this type of acceleration of breath uh is is um is very healthy and it&#39;s actually what we saw in when 2001 when small cap value and international dramatically outperformed even though there was some weakness short-term weakness in the economy and Tech got smashed ### HEADLINES_AND_NEWS\nother periods where you saw this was the second term of trump where well again a second term of Reagan where again International outperformed domestic as we saw the chart earlier Friday&#39;s advancing volume second highest since uh covid 202&#39;s Market recovery interesting uh uh I don&#39;t know why okay uh here we go dollar rolling over oh this is interesting the EU Aerospace and defense index up dramatically relative to the mag7 index a lot of things are up relative it&#39;s it&#39;s not hard to beat 7.7% if you go to mag which is the mag 7 ETF it&#39;s down 7.7% maybe a little more by the close 10year yield down for seven straight weeks remember at 480 everyone was calling for five and I said three handle before five handle and uh we may not see a five handle before Trump is out of office so um that&#39;s that Goldman Sachs top down S&P 500 forecast we talk about guidance coming down home affordability is the lowest it&#39;s been since 20067 8 that doesn&#39;t mean we&#39;re going to have a housing crisis but I do think we are going to have some normalization of prices probably somewhat offset by lower mortgage rates creating demand so it&#39;ll be a wash and that affordability will go up as the cost of ownership goes down you know if you take a 10year from 480 down to 350 and you get 30-year fix rates at 5.5 the affordability from 7 two which it was a week ago not a week ago a month ago for a 30-year fix down to 55 uh you know that&#39;s huge that cuts 25 30% off the monthly payment and uh even if uh prices come down 10% I think you&#39;re going to see huge demand bids so not a housing crisis but an opportunity in the making except where there&#39;s super froth you know there&#39;s some areas where houses doubled after Co then doubled again uh those I could getting hit 30% may you know uh but we&#39;ll see chop frustration is normal we got that uh shortterm sentiment extremely pessimistic that&#39;s just another indicator pointing to a technical bounce here in coming days and weeks put volume second highest Spike of all time um you know so that tends to be a contrarian indicator large caps to small caps S&P 500 uh divided by Russell 2000 haven&#39;t seen it since 2001 I think you are going to see a ripy face off rally in small caps once we get through this tariff noise and going into the close I do think that Trump was saying that he likes the president of Mexico or something and uh he&#39;s going to back off on certain things I you know it&#39;s dayto day welcome to Trump 2.0 same as Trump 1.0 another day another headline another volatility and it resolves to the upside so uh just uh enjoy enjoy the show ladies and gentlemen growth of okay so that&#39;s that uh bull bear spread we covered crowded and cracking it was momentum and it&#39;s getting smashed I think uh paler was down another 10% or 8% today uh mag seven earnings reminder decelerating uh unmagnify accelerating that&#39;s why the opportunities are going to be in the UNM magnificent 493 and uh coming out of the mag even if you get this technical bounce so uh I it&#39;ll be interesting to see when they get this bounce in the next few weeks how many people chase up when they get near back near the top of the recent range and then they get smacked again but uh time will tell uh 50% of stocks outperforming the S&P 500 up from just 30% last year this is what we saw last when 2001 what happened then regime change International outperformed value outperformed growth International outperformed domestic F value outperform growth small cap outperform large cap ### MISCELLANEOUS\nI continue to repeat this because it continues to not be believed and even as it&#39;s happening right under everyone&#39;s noses in real time and they&#39;re distracted with Trump when they should be paying attention to Japanese bond yields uh active investors have moved closer to the Benchmark since uh 2023 all closet index Huggers complete value list uh in that regard and uh smart people know and have figured that out and allocate to people that are uncorrelated with the indes uh or low correlation because they&#39;re actually doing real work uh 10-year treasury yield rolling over retail investors pile on Hong Kong listings through margin loans yeeha let it rip ladies and gentlemen Mainland buying Baba like it&#39;s going out of style uh as we had anticipated last summer and Brendan ahern&#39;s done a good job job of documenting that on his Twitter feed definitely check him out um us 10-year yield testing 2025 lows no one\n\nEuropean stocks rally to start 2025 uncertainty at an all-time high that&#39;s when you want to be a buyer not a seller and that&#39;s the GDP estimates gone down to 2.4% uh Wards Automotive US Auto Sales SAR uh was sales were down 2% in February understandable with consumer confidence through the floor with the fears around tariffs creating inflation again it&#39;s not whether the outcome is good or bad it&#39;s whether Wall Street knows the rules and once we have certainty in policy Market&#39;s going to go straight up on that type of 18.2% earnings growth uh guidance was weak it&#39;s expected to be weak the first two weeks every two two months every year but not as bad as I thought the estimates are still holding in at 271 down from Peak 275 which is really not a big downgrade and 2025 six rather has gone up so as always backend loaded set expectations low exceed them everyone&#39;s happy until late summer when we get some seasonal weakness again but in the mean time the party will be on again on no one&#39;s Bingo cards right now but wait and see and that&#39;s what you will see so crypto flows you know the one thing that the crypto community may have overlooked is be careful what you wish for um you know that the thesis behind Bitcoin in particular because uh some of the others have great like great utility I&#39;ve had great conversations with experts in ethereum I think that&#39;s going to be something to pay attention to as a real platform but uh it&#39;s not what I do so I&#39;m not even going to comment on it and I&#39;m not even it&#39;s just it&#39;s like I&#39;m a golfer I I don&#39;t watch basketball that much so like I can enjoy basketball but I I have zero value at around basketball so I I have I&#39;m completely agnostic about this but as it relates to bitcoin because I see sailor a lot on TV and everything uh and leveraging up like it&#39;s going out of style and borrowing money to buy more Bitcoin and all that stuff and maybe it&#39;ll end well and so far it&#39;s going well and everyone thinks he&#39;s a genius um but what they don&#39;t count on if they get what they want which is a crypto-friendly uh Administration putting regulation in um being pro crypto is that the very thing that put them in the position that they are is the perceived scarcity around Bitcoin and what they may not be accounting for is the amount of assets allocated to crypto um that only have you know three or for legitimate places to go whether Bitcoin ethereum a couple others maybe um when the administration does what they want them to do um hundreds if not thousands of new crypto issuers are going to come to bear and compete for that fixed bucket of crypto assets and you could say well the bucket will grow maybe it&#39;ll grow a bit that that that that&#39;s certainly possible possible that wouldn&#39;t surprise me at all but you are going to have thousands of new issuers getting into the gold rush and while everyone thought the particular coin or token was scarce what they didn&#39;t count on is an is an unlimited supply of coins and tokens that may be quote unquote scarce but the overall bucket becomes unlimited and it dilutes the hell out of each individual one and only the ones that actually have utility in terms of transaction owners ship um uh Etc which is you know one or two um we get washed away so that&#39;s where it is uh I have nothing really valuable to say maybe well we we won&#39;t but um so something to keep in mind uh Brent down I keep looking for more opportunities and energy and I keep pointing right back to com stock resources which we have a big position side by side with Jerry Jones uh none of the other stuff is coming out here&#39;s where we are in terms of tariffs again we&#39;ve covered this on TV uh if he does a 100% of everything we&#39;re still nowhere near where we were uh at the we we would be still below where we were in the mid-20s remember they raised tariffs for some 12 straight years of economic Prosperity before you got to smooth Holly um so that&#39;s that&#39;s where we are that&#39;s where we make maybe if if everything happens but already he&#39;s walking back Mexico so that takes it back down uh we are at record low historic tariffs so just keep that in mind ### MACRO_DATA_SLIDES\nnatural gas going straight through the roof we like that okay Logistics managers this is interesting the logistics managers Index this relates to gxo Rose for a second consecutive month to 62.8 making the strongest growth in logistics sector since June 2022 again dstock cycle to restock cycle which we&#39;ve covered many many times on this podcast sharp increase in inventory levels this led to higher inventory costs in warehousing prices while warehousing capacity decreased because they had a glut of warehousing capacity remember they built out too much because everything that happened at Co Peak now it&#39;s being absorbed um and and so on and so forth so that should bode well for gxo in coming quarters once the CMA stuff is pretty much resolved and the new CEO is announced which will be a rock star if passes any prologue as it relates to the type of people that uh Brad Jacobs attracts share of clients expecting the US to be the best performing Global Equity region at the Goldman Sachs Global strategy conference in January the highest percentage of managers expected us to be the best this year and they were all wrong it&#39;s not even a competition S&amp;P up uh excuse me S&amp;P down close to 1% year to date Europe up up 15% uh kweb up 25% Bob up 65% uh you know there you go that&#39;s that chances of a cut we covered us trade policy uncertainty index I mean this is where opportunities are made everything that got hit by tariffs I think is going to be the buy opportunity of a Sentry in coming weeks um and we&#39;ll just wait and see percentage of companies expected to outpace the mag seven up from just 8% at the lows of second half 2023 going straight up and so on and these are also coincidentally um yeah the times you want that that you start to see massive broadening ### FEATURED_COMPANY_DEEP_DIVES\nAlibaba Shar held via southbound stock connect absolutely ramping up every single Mainland Chinese person is buying Alibaba stock like it&#39;s going out of style billions more billions in billions more to come and the international people will slowly but surely start to be forced in not because they want to invest in China but because they want to keep their jobs and the problem is is they&#39;re so underweight China and they&#39;re so underweight International and they&#39;re dramatically underperforming and they now have job risk so all of the sudden their ideology about G and communism and all the excuses uh go out the window just like you saw with all the woke is broke once they start going up everyone chases them and this time will be no different mortgage rates coming down they&#39;re going to go a lot lower China sets official deficit at decades high level they&#39;re going to stimulate till the cows come home deficit spending like it&#39;s going out of style 4% of GDP that is a big deal massive spending program focused on consumption there&#39;s natural gas going through the roof this was don&#39;t have that date infrastructure daily trading sentiment has fallen to extreme pessimism from Ryan Dietrich uh ndr research rather uh this is where you get these technical bounces so pay attention that&#39;s bespoke same thing a lot of different indicators pointing to the same thing that&#39;s the Fed so last year&#39;s we said the last will be first that&#39;s been the case international Healthcare Etc the first shall be last paler Nvidia they&#39;re probably the uh so they were the best last year uh in the last two weeks paler is down 32% Nvidia is down 16% this is probably uh as of March 4th and that&#39;s just the last two weeks year-to date it&#39;s double that probably on both of those um what else is getting smashed broadcom uh Arista networks Marvel Netflix um Tesla and so on Alibaba stock Rose More than 70% since the January low Euro rebounds to four-month high against the US dollar is weakening euro is strengthening dollar is rolling over similar to Trump 1.0 we covered that look at this move in the euro China switches priority to consumption in work report from highquality development they did a complete 180 degree turnaround from last year and look what&#39;s happening um semiconductor cycle that&#39;s the semiconductor cycle we covered last week small cap out performer this is interesting this is that last time we saw these levels were early 2000s and then again in 2009 and then we had an A Monster outperformance in small caps following those periods so it&#39;s definitely worth paying attention to there&#39;s the kweb just getting started cranking uh kudos to Brenan we were in the Foxhole together I remember when we played golf together uh someone and I I put a picture on Twitter I think it was in the late summer or early fall or something like that and uh it was near the lows and someone said uh Tom and brandan getting together is going to Mark the bottom in China and they were right it basically went straight up ever since then so uh so that&#39;s that um here&#39;s another put volume this this is a wash out all these people that record Put volume on the day I was on with vanney those people are going to get flushed the sellers of the puts are going going to be the ones that made all the money the buyers are going to get smoked um you you know just for future reference ladies and gentlemen you want to buy insurance on your house before you have a fire it&#39;s amazing how many people buy puts in the hole when the not only is the price near the bottom but the implied volatility is at record highs and people are buying puts in the hole as if that&#39;s going to protect them uh it&#39;s too late you know you can&#39;t call Chub after after the house is half burning down it&#39;s just one the premiums would be too high and two they don&#39;t protect much because you only get half a house so uh leave it at that want to put this guy on uh he had some interesting things to say about uh daily domestic consumption U David final question for you we&#39;ve we&#39;ve yet to talk about tariffs in this specific conversation and the re the reason I frame it that way is I&#39;m curious to what extent tariffs or the external challenges will be referenced these next few days well I let me be fair Frank okay I I strongly believe this time around tariff is no longer a big issue I would even if you give me a order of three top issues in China or challenges in China I don&#39;t even put top three even among the top three the Tariff from president Trump in fact the whole economy Was preparing for 40% even 60% of tariff hike from president Trump now he&#39;s only imposing 10% of course they indirect tariff upon Chinese uh products from Mexico from Canada from Europe but overall it&#39;s still smaller than people anticipated it&#39;s smaller than uh the year of 2018 so this time around we the Chinese economy is fully fully prepared I do not think the the Tariff is big issue the really to deal with tariff is the same as deal with other issues in Chinese economy that is to boost domestic consumption and on this issue there&#39;s already tremendous tremendous discussions and also a lot of policies will be implemented down the road and we&#39;re back uh ### HEADLINES_AND_NEWS\nAlibaba stock is rising why is Bucking the tech selloff uh obviously

HEADLINES_AND_NEWS\nstock market and sentiment results this article goes into PayPal investor day with Alex Chris and uh Shane o Kelly with Advanced Auto Parts we are running long on time so we've got to get through this and basically what we cover\n\nin credit because they don&#39;t want to take Equity risk and um and that&#39;s that so look uh if you Google you will see every two years he says the Market&#39;s going to crash and the fact of the matter is um he was right in 2008 and he made a ton of money and um and you really only have to be right once or twice in life to make a fortune whether that&#39;s in buying businesses building businesses picking a wife uh you don&#39;t have to be right a million times and uh nor should everyone anyone expect people to be right I mean at the end of the day the guy made 14 billion so so what if he made a few bad calls he made one or two right ones and uh and he made a fortune so I wouldn&#39;t worry about that uh he&#39;s going to be right again at some point I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s in three years or three months or or 20 years but um the message has been consistent let&#39;s just leave it at that Luca Milo thanks for the amazing content every week I share it with everyone that&#39;s interested in financial markets and they started following you too thank you very much uh what do you think leged plat uh it&#39;s a Furniture maker so it&#39;s going to be in the short term going to be hurt I think that uh it did have some balance sheet risk but uh you know it&#39;s in a big downtrend I mean the number one thing you need to do on this company is solvency risk but I think this could wind up being an interesting if not trade investment uh but this is the type of thing where i&#39; I&#39;d probably have to go understand the business really really carefully before so it looks like they&#39;ve got $350 million of cash and how much debt uh two billion so or 1.8 billion so you got to see when all that comes due uh you got to see what they&#39;re generating in terms of this is this is the issue uh let&#39;s see here cash from operations no cash from operations is not bad 305 million uh free cash flow 224 million so you just have to do the math [Music] on see cash from financing cash interest paid 84 million you just have to see when all these come to but I like the idea I definitely like the idea Luca and it&#39;s probably worth some more work ### ASK_ME_ANYTHING_QA\nokay we got that okay this one is from Grayson Harris what sort of path in the finance industry would you recommend college students who enjoy value investing what sort of firm environment would your college grad be able to prosper in a solid value investor without going off on their own number one you can&#39;t you can try to go off on your own but uh uh I I&#39;m going to repeat it I would never suggest taking other people&#39;s money to manage until you have proven that you don&#39;t need any money because you&#39;ve made enough money in markets for yourself and you&#39;ve gone through two or three Cycles working for someone else um and proven that you have lived through enough cycles and you know what you&#39;re doing before you take on that enormous responsibility um because if you do it wrong and you do it early you will not recover uh and um I I don&#39;t I don&#39;t even say that remotely lightly that&#39;s uh you know serious is a heart attack with that advice um and then what what skills do you hone through value investing that are transferable to other sectors I think it&#39;s you know the the language of numbers is critical for any and all businesses as a matter of fact uh I I think it&#39;s critical if you&#39;re in school and you can take accounting courses and you can take finance courses I would say that your odds of success in being an entrepreneur and starting a business are much higher than your odds of success in as an investor and the people who do investing well uh make it look a lot easier than it is because for every word that comes out of their mouth there&#39;s probably 75 thoughts and uh historical Frameworks that are running in in the background that you don&#39;t know and can&#39;t understand without living through 20 plus years of markets so um that&#39;s number one number two um it&#39;s a lot more competitive than you think uh you know you&#39;re going against the smartest you know smart quot smartest students in the world smartest you know people got the highest grades and all all of that stuff so it&#39;s not a walk in the park I mean I if you absolutely love it and it&#39;s what you do you know if you if you wound up at another job and like all night long all you&#39;re doing is studying stocks and you don&#39;t go to bed till you get to your job and like it&#39;s what you love then it&#39;s probably what you should do but if it&#39;s like oh that&#39;s where I should go to make money because I can make more money ah huge huge life mistake uh you won&#39;t be able to compete with people who love to do it 247 uh and you&#39;ll get you&#39;ll get smoked out um so my B best suggestion in your 20s is you don&#39;t have to be a genius you just have to be persistent and consistent and you could build a business that&#39;ll make you so much more money uh before you&#39;re 30 than you would ever make in the finance uh industry um but if you play the turtle hair game you know having the skill of being a a great investor uh when all is said and done by the time you&#39;re 50 uh you know the scales tip and and you got compounding in the rearview mirror and you might might wind up uh a lot further ahead but you really have to love it I would go to youtube.com under the hedge fund tips Channel and put in the search bar University of Bristol I did an hour interview with their investor Club on uh my suggestions if you do want to get into the business um it&#39;s a narrower opening than it was 20 years ago um when regulations were easy and anyone and their mother could start a hedge fund uh in the early 2000s and that all changed when the rules changed uh so it&#39;s a lot more expensive much higher barriers of Entry a lot fewer startups um but uh but also I like that because um it it creates a it creates a moat so uh or a small moat if you&#39;re really good at it and you love it uh so the short answer to your question is if you love it go for it you&#39;ll figure it out if you are just doing it because it looks like an easy way to make money uh absolutely do not go in this direction uh go build a business or or go work for someone first [Music] um I think there&#39;s so many unbelievable opportunities to make a ton of money as an entrepreneur nowadays with all the platforms available to you and all the ways to reach markets that have never existed if you have a good idea go for it and you may fail in two or three businesses in your 20s that&#39;s perfectly normal as an entrepreneur uh in finance you can&#39;t do that you can&#39;t blow up a fund and expect to ever come back I mean people do it but it&#39;s the exception not the rule so that&#39;s that you know on a business you can just rebound and do it again and do it again most entrepreneurs probably fail two or three times before they have their big big hit that would probably be an exciting way to live if if you don&#39;t know if you love investing uh but um but that&#39;s that uh Michael silver Tidewater I just go with Slumber Jay if you have to or um yeah this was obviously delution at some point I I I don&#39;t like that one even rig I don&#39;t like I I would just go up the food chain and go to something like SLB or HP or uh noov if you have to be in the space and you can&#39;t resist that that&#39;s probably more where I would be interested um but I don&#39;t have to so I won&#39;t uh moving on Christopher Williams block not interested we like PayPal I knew no David Martin Philip uh do you have a preference between Bungie or ADM uh I would go for Archer Daniels Midland RCI what is this thing is this a cable operator yeah Communications company wireless cable and media internet access I mean this is kind of like the Comcast story they all look interesting here um I think this probably could this will probably wind up working but uh I would definitely do some work on it here but if you&#39;re totally right you&#39;re going to get a double and I I don&#39;t think it&#39;s a good enough business to take that risk and I don&#39;t like I don&#39;t need to be totally right I like things that I can be half wrong and still make a triple in a few years so uh it&#39;s not for me Kyle Burns uh if you were the CEO of Advanced Auto Parts would you be doing something different than Chanel Kelly or do you feel that he&#39;s doing exact same way you would do things or is there room for improvement I I literally wouldn&#39;t change one thing that Shane o&#39; Kelly is doing as a matter of fact he&#39;s doing a better job than I would and that&#39;s why he&#39;s going to wind up with probably a triple if not more uh and that&#39;s why I just pick the jockeys versus having to implement the execution uh because I pick people who can do it better it&#39;s the same way it&#39;s the same reason that people are who are you know sentim Millionaires and billionaires pick me to manage their money it&#39;s not because they couldn&#39;t learn it and do it it&#39;s because they&#39;re already rich so they&#39;re going to delegate to someone who specialized that they don&#39;t do it all day for 20 years uh and just like I&#39;m going to delegate to Shane o Kelly who&#39;s been doing this stuff for three decades between Home Depot Supply and other successful runs uh and you can hear his whole interview and Brack and Daryl from Old Spice days to Logitech to Proctor and Gamble I mean these guys that&#39;s all they&#39;ve done for decades so I&#39;m going to delegate the execution to them because they&#39;re going to be the best out of it&#39;s not because you know Shane o Kelly is 10 IQ points higher than Tom Hayes therefore he&#39;s doing a better job it&#39;s because that&#39;s all he does uh and and and so on and so forth so the more successful people you meet the more you will realize that they delegate more than you would ever imagine doing you the things that you could do are different than the things you should do the good is the enemy the better is the enemy of the best if you are not doing your highest and best value and you&#39;re not delegate and you&#39;re not delegating you&#39;re doing a disservice to the world so I&#39;m at a stage now where I&#39;m delegating everything that&#39;s not picking stocks or interacting with clients the things that I do best uh everything else is has been effectively delegated now more or less I&#39;d say I&#39;m if I&#39;m not 80% there I&#39;m 80 90% there and all I have to think about nowadays is um picking stocks which is what I love to do which is my highest and best use because you you you don&#39;t outperform by consensus any of the best funds in the world it&#39;s one or two people and usually one person making all the decisions and then they have support staff to get everything else done and operations and excellence and all of that stuff um uh and by the way that was the case for for diio by the way uh and uh I know his number two extremely well played poker with him for 10 years and um they made effectively all the decisions even though they had a thousand people they had a thousand bodies why because when pensions come in to see you uh they have this metric and the more bodies you have in seats doing busy work the bigger the check they&#39;re allowed to write you so if you want you know $200 million from a pension fund you better have 50 people sitting in seats uh whether they&#39;re doing anything or not is immaterial uh it just it just pays to pay them a salary to sit there so you can get a bigger check from a pension I&#39;m not in that game I&#39;ve never optimized for maximum a I&#39;ve always optimized for quality of life doing what I love and making sure that every single partner I have every investor is someone that I enjoy respect and would hang out with whether or not we did business and if I meet that I live happy life they live a happy life everything&#39;s good and if I optimize for AUM and I start dealing with 12-year olds with clipboards counting the number bodies and seeds it takes me away from doing what I do best which is picking stocks so uh that&#39;s how I&#39;ve decided to live my life and it works great for me ### ASK_ME_ANYTHING_QA\num okay so uh David okay thoughts on docu or valet doy sign I I I don&#39;t really have an interest in this I I I don&#39;t all right let&#39;s try valet valet will probably work for a trade but I mean you&#39;re lucky to make a double if everything goes right so uh for me no but I think valy is ready to go Nick thank you for all your wisdom and help with things in stock market I&#39;m an avid listener every week over here in the UK want to ask your thought about Powell Industries uh okay P WL thank you by the way for all of the Avid listeners and particularly those folks uh no no this was a 20 bagger it&#39;s a broken momentum stock I don&#39;t want to buy it up here regardless of how good the fundamentals look now because the stock is telling me that the fundamentals are probably going to deteriorate pretty quickly so uh for me that&#39;s a pass ### ASK_ME_ANYTHING_QA\num David [Music] Gavin look at Denny&#39;s ah these are tough I mean we&#39;re over restaured here in the US all this is is a debt story let&#39;s take a look at the balance sheet here because question is is whether this thing why is the cash so low these numbers have to be wrong if these numbers are right Run for the hills I think these numbers are wrong says they got $3 million of cash and uh $261 million of debt um I don&#39;t know that that can be right let&#39;s see what their free cash flow is this this is this is not for me I mean it looks like it wants to bounce from a trading perspective for sure and it is a legacy brand but uh that&#39;s just going to go in my to Hard Box uh Alex CK Hutchinson Holdings Hong Kong I will not buy any Chinese stock other than Alibaba and if I had to buy one or two more it would be ba and 10 cent uh I I won&#39;t buy any midcaps or small caps I&#39;m not taking country and Company risk I mean our our original thesis with ba baba was if if uh if Baba goes down so does China I mean that&#39;s basically what it comes down to so uh I&#39;ve seen too many frauds in China over the years I&#39;ve seen people get burned by frauds in China every cycle I won&#39;t I mean no way I mean Alibaba has been stress tested over and over there are tons of outs I&#39;m not going to play in other stock so you know if you want a lagard in China because everything else has moved up if I had to take buy put a ton of new money to work in China and I didn&#39;t want to chase up baba uh I&#39;d probably start to take a hard look at Buu um and that&#39;ll be a a lower quality but catch up but as far as betting on like obscure stocks that I have no Edge uh hard pass because we&#39;re going to pull up the numbers they&#39;re going to look great and then there&#39;s a coin flip chance in nine months it turns out to be a fraud and there&#39;s nothing like uh you can do about it you have no Edge ### HEADLINES_AND_NEWS\nJames sent me a nice article in

downgrade in the hole when the stock is up they all upgrade at the top uh and that&#39;s and that&#39;s the name of the game so analysts are now flipping on Baba because you know the price has doubled up plus uh but it&#39;s just the beginning they will start to come in herds and after it gets over 200 everyone will be upgrading and you know when it&#39;s beyond that you will see everyone uniformly

car and your MSRP goes from you know $50,000 to $50,000 20 because the rubber got more expensive it it really is is immaterial you know if you're selling Transmissions maybe that's a different story if your part goes from 7,000 to uh 8,500 you might have a problem but if it goes from you know 190 to 2110 it's like it's it's a rounding error and it's going to be passed through to the oems and then through the customers but also if interest rates go down and then you have tax deductibility on the auto loan uh that's a big deal that's a big deal\n### ASK_ME_ANYTHING_QA\nBill McGrew thanks for doing such a great podcast I never miss it wondering what your thought of APA a little cheaper than com stock on a Enterprise Value to free cash flow that is not a metric you would use for an energy company you're looking at proved and improved reserves value um I think it's uh I think apache's okay and I think that uh Comstock has more upside on a multiple basis so we're already at uh double and a half on uh 2 and a half X on comto resources I wouldn't bet on aache even being a double and I think Comstock is going to probably uh double again from here so that'll be like four 5x and um not will not be the case with Apache if you're lucky with aache you'll be up 50% so I would just uh leave it at that that's that's not the way you value this type of company but uh longtime listener can you look at halberton yeah I like halberton better than I like Tidewater um let's just put that in here but I think you you know I think you're taking some kind of risk for a maximum maximum double uh

think we&#39;re still dramatically undervalued um we we inflected uh a business that had been losing uh money for two years in a row and delivered you know if I&#39;d come to you a year ago and said you know how would you feel about 5% transaction margin 6% transaction margin in 24 I think pretty much everyone would have been like yeah there&#39;s no possible way you can do that and we delivered it um and then we put uh together you know again we&#39;re being prudent I I had a lot of conversations with investors when I got here and um a lot of the feedback was hey in the past the company had been really bullish on projections and then missed and that&#39;s just not my style that&#39;s not the mentality that we have and so we&#39;re going to tell you when we when we say something we&#39;ve got line of sight to it and we&#39;re going to go execute against it my guess is um there&#39;s been a lot of suffering in this stock in the last few years you just have to look at the chart and and understand that you know there was a Peak and then it fell and so we&#39;ve got a lot of investors both retail and and institutional that have lived through that and I think with a brand new leadership team coming in um we&#39;re in a bit of a waitand see mode and the best thing we can do is deliver for customers execute our plan provide you as much transparency as possible as to what we&#39;re doing and have a very high say do ratio um we beat every quarter that we told we were what we were going to do um abely I know everyone wants us to beat by even more and like all of that happens we also have to recognize that the Innovations we&#39;re putting out um take time right I this is just I&#39;ve worked in different businesses this just happens to be one where you know we are at a scale where when we put a merchant Innovation out like these new Innovations we have for for Branded checkout they are crushing it when you look at the conversion rate Improvement it just takes time to roll this out like we&#39;re talking about tens of Millions of merchants and even the largest Enterprise ones it just takes time to get into their ecosystem we make a consumer change we launch PayPal everywhere it takes time I mean the fact that we got three million new PayPal everywhere debit card users in the first you know quarter and a half is it&#39;s insanely fast it is and it&#39;s still not good enough right because because everyone wants more and so absolutely look I don&#39;t know how long it&#39;s going to take for folks to sort of say hey we&#39;re gonna we understand that this leadership team is delivering on their on their commitments um but if you&#39;re looking for you know everything to turn around in in two months this probably isn&#39;t the right stock for you uh this is this is a business that we are building a flywheel that becomes the leader in in Commerce for the next decade and Beyond and that may take a few quarters or a couple of years and I think we were uh again we put out some um I think pretty exciting uh goals at yesterday in terms of what we think our long-term um transaction margin and EPS growth will look like we wouldn&#39;t put those out if we didn&#39;t have L line ofite to if we didn&#39;t know that hey when we execute uh on these growth levers and we&#39;ve got lots of growth levers now uh when we execute on this we&#39;re going to deliver it so you know again apologies that this isn&#39;t a fast you know flip of the switch and all of a sudden everything turns around but 800 basis point Improvement in transaction margin in the first you know year is is pretty significant and uh I think we&#39;re just getting started yeah and the Topline numbers you know may not be what some people are expecting and hoping but the bottom line that&#39;s right I feel like PayPal has been lacking let&#39;s I mean let&#39;s talk about that so I got here and you know we had really good Revenue growth numbers right really good Revenue growth numbers empty calories right Revenue growth numbers with declining transaction margin so look it may be it may be uncomfortable and it may be the hard decisions but I&#39;m going to make the right decisions for the company for the long term and going back and having price to Value conversations I won&#39;t apologize for that I mean our our revenue is absolutely slowing for a period of time until we have these conversations but I can tell you the conversations we&#39;re having are incredible the conversations we&#39;re having with Merchants now to be able to price the value for them to be able to take all the different value added Services we&#39;re bringing together to now have conversations about ads we are having healthy relationships that are building the foundation for growth for the future so it is absolutely the right decision and we&#39;ve been as transparent as we can around hey revenue is going to come down for a couple of quarters and then we&#39;ll inflect and grow back but I would much rather rip the bandid off have the hard decisions and build this company for the long term then grab a couple more quarters of increasing empty calorie Revenue that&#39;s not delivering anything for the company for the long term but it looks really good and I I just don&#39;t want to do that I want to build this for the long term so if you&#39;re interested in in being with us for the longterm which I know you are uh then I think I think uh um this is the right place for you and and you know if you want a quarter of just you know Big Poppy"
