[61.44s] well boom picking Corners baby uh then I
[66.0s] want to thank Christian dagger and
[68.52s] Preston miselle for having me on vne and
[70.72s] Co with the great Stu vanney and Stu
[74.36s] like he always likes to wants to know
[76.36s] what&#39;s gonna happen today what&#39;s going
[77.96s] to happen tomorrow and uh we had that
[80.68s] huge flush on Tuesday and I said we are
[84.56s] a buyer today in the hole and then sure
[87.159s] enough we got a massive rebound on
[89.079s] Wednesday
[90.479s] uh a retest today Fridays and Mondays
[94.32s] have been weak all year so but I do
[97.119s] think we&#39;re going to get that turnaround
[98.759s] and I do think we&#39;re going to be a lot
[101.159s] higher two weeks out so time will tell
[104.32s] but here it is let&#39;s see how it plays
[107.32s] out tune in here now the m is in
[110.799s] correction territory and as of now the
[113.399s] Dow is negative for the year Market
[115.719s] Watcher Tom Hayes joins me on the phone
[118.28s] here&#39;s the negatives we&#39; we got tariffs
[120.64s] imposed we&#39;ve got a trade War we&#39;ve got
[123.88s] inflation that&#39;s still not beaten and
[127.52s] you know there&#39;s other things going
[128.599s] wrong as well what&#39;s the is and the
[131.16s] Market&#39;s way way down is this a buying
[133.48s] opportunity right now Tom unquestionably
[136.959s] Stu this is the buying opportunity of
[139.68s] the first quarter uh you know we need to
[142.28s] step back and keep in mind that tariffs
[144.76s] were raised almost every single year
[147.959s] following the Spanish Flu in 19 18 all
[151.12s] the way up to 1929 before Smoot Holly we
[154.92s] are nowhere near those tariff levels
[158.16s] that&#39;s number one number two Commerce
[160.44s] Secretary Howard lutnick has emphasized
[163.56s] these tariffs are fentol related which
[166.599s] means there is a way out you stop the
[169.2s] fentol we will consider stopping the
[171.64s] tariffs uh that is a huge factor and I&#39;m
[174.92s] going to go out on a limb here I&#39;m going
[177.2s] to tell you stu markets are going to be
[180.76s] much higher two weeks from now than they
[183.239s] are right now I&#39;m looking at a bunch of
[185.56s] technical indicators which I don&#39;t spend
[187.04s] a lot of time on you know I&#39;m a
[188.28s] fundamental analyst we are close to
[190.92s] washed out across the board so we are
[193.28s] going to be in the market shopping today
[196.36s] and this afternoon and maybe tomorrow as
[198.879s] well but most likely today we will be
[201.08s] putting on materially sized positions
[203.799s] all right cleancut decision from Tom

[311.56s] pleasure I want to introduce you to
[313.44s] Thomas Hayes of great Hill Capital Tom
[316.08s] great thank you for making time my
[317.759s] friend thanks for having me Luke I
[320.199s] wouldn&#39;t be anywhere else this is going
[321.759s] to be uh looking forward to this for a
[323.96s] while yeah no pressure man we&#39;re going
[325.52s] to just you rely on your stock pick so I
[327.199s] gave a speculative micro cap save me
[330.44s] later on in this discussion by giving
[332.319s] some our viewers some good conservative
[334.639s] undervalued plays so um hey if you&#39;re
[337.8s] good with it I wanted to start with a
[339.0s] couple of the topics I started off just
[340.319s] kind of part of the interruption style
[342.28s] quick hit what do you think agree
[343.72s] disagree and and tell me why so is this
[346.36s] bull market cooked or we still cooking
[348.08s] with gas we&#39;re still cooking with gas we
[351.479s] just need to be a little bit more
[353.639s] selective uh I think you know if you
[355.759s] look at the S&amp;P is actually down now
[358.52s] half a percent year to date but if you
[361.12s] start to look at International and some
[362.639s] of the other stocks which you referenced
[364.16s] in the a block uh tremendous
[366.639s] outperformance you know Europe up 15%
[369.8s] year to date yeah my Italian Breen are
[372.24s] up 19% alone so we got to give a shout
[374.599s] out to those Italians and Jersey Boys
[376.12s] like
[376.8s] yourself that&#39;s right that&#39;s right so
[379.28s] where do you like in in Europe I mean
[380.72s] are you looking at particular
[382.12s] opportunities I mean I know you run a
[383.44s] more concentrated portfolio wildly
[385.72s] successful too by the way folks this is
[387.36s] not something Tom would ever say out
[388.8s] loud I have no giving him credit he was
[391.199s] right about Disney I was wrong he&#39;s
[392.88s] probably going to be right about other
[393.88s] big stocks but where are you finding
[395.08s] value now in
[396.28s] Europe yeah in Europe we&#39;re a bit more
[399.52s] selective on the big Arbitrage has been
[402.56s] in the most unpopular region in the
[404.4s] world which is China and I&#39;m going to
[407.319s] give you a stat right now Lou that&#39;s
[408.759s] going to blow your mind if you look at
[411.0s] the tremendous 10 which is the Chinese
[415.12s] internet equivalent of the US mag 7 uh
[419.8s] the spread of outperformance year to
[423.039s] date is
[424.919s] 45% in China internet so that&#39;s
[428.68s] companies like Alibaba what are what are
[430.56s] some of the names that that run down
[432.0s] that list yeah so alibaba&#39;s up 64% year
[435.56s] to date uh if you if you look at my
[437.639s] friend brandan ahern&#39;s uh kweb ETF China
[440.84s] ETF up 25% year to date and if you look
[444.28s] at the Magnificent 7 in the US down
[448.52s] 7.7% year to dat you can look at the uh
[451.319s] ETF Ms will give you the year-to-date
[454.199s] performance on the basket so what we&#39;re
[456.96s] seeing Lou is we&#39;re seeing a weakening
[458.96s] of the US dollar we&#39;re seeing the 10year
[461.52s] yield uh bond yields come down this all
[464.4s] favors International I really love that
[466.96s] chart you put out earlier in your show
[469.96s] about showing that while US Stock
[472.96s] exceptionalism has been the norm for the
[474.919s] last 10 13 14 15 years it actually moves
[479.8s] in regular Cycles every 10 to 15 years
[482.319s] and in the second term of Reagan for
[484.96s] instance uh International stocks
[487.759s] dramatically outperform the US after a
[490.24s] long period of us outperformance so uh
[492.639s] we can get caught up in recency bias and
[494.84s] say only US Stocks because that&#39;s what&#39;s
[496.68s] worked the last 10 years but if we zoom
[498.96s] out which is a core of our framework
[501.879s] we&#39;ll see that these are regular cycles
[503.72s] and and uh you know we&#39;ve been talking
[505.96s] for the last few months lighting up on
[508.639s] mag 7 and start to get some
[510.4s] International exposure and that that&#39;s
[512.2s] uh that&#39;s now think it&#39;s a great Point
[514.24s] as you said it there I want to make sure
[515.479s] people caught the newest start to get
[516.959s] some International exposure not bail out
[518.919s] of all your us exposure but
[520.479s] opportunistically I mean this is what we
[521.919s] talk about as a tactical allocation
[523.76s] right like you have your your mix and
[525.88s] then as opportunities present I mean as
[527.68s] you said I mean even the Apple the
[529.839s] Beloved apple of my eye is trading at 32
[531.92s] times forward earnings right now that&#39;s
[533.56s] rich historically I mean you look at
[535.6s] alphabet it&#39;s it&#39;s probably the most
[537.0s] affordable at 19 but where&#39;s what
[539.519s] valuations are you seeing in China I
[541.0s] mean is it you know are we talking 10 to
[542.959s] 12 times 14 times earnings like
[545.72s] what listen you still can&#39;t give them
[547.959s] away this is early days I mean yeah I
[551.399s] look and by the way I&#39;m not sitting here
[553.279s] to take any Victory lap because uh you
[555.519s] know as well as anyone else I&#39;ve been in
[557.64s] Baba you know this has been a position
[559.32s] that we&#39;ve been building for two years
[562.24s] uh and not on purpose okay I mean you
[564.72s] know we started buying in the hundreds
[566.16s] and when it got honey sorry I bought
[567.8s] some more alib Baba yeah yeah when it
[571.04s] got down to 60 we backed up the truck so
[573.04s] yes we have a basis of 83 across all
[575.079s] accounts uh and we&#39;re very excited about
[577.279s] that but this is early days I mean
[579.839s] basically price is what you pay value is
[581.8s] what you get they&#39;re still trading at 12
[584.56s] 13 times forward earnings and growth is
[587.24s] reaccelerating you know you talk about
[589.12s] Apple being expensive uh at 30 times
[592.48s] relative to its historic multiple had
[595.079s] been 14 times what what what is I say
[599.64s] concerning but what is different is the
[602.24s] earnings growth is low double digits
[604.56s] like 12% earnings growth and paying 33
[607.079s] if it was growing at
[608.64s] 20% Then 33 would be very realistic so I
[612.279s] think these things are taking a taking a
[614.6s] little breather for sure so great
[616.76s] overview I mean great specifics on Baba
[619.04s] I know everyone is appreciating that I
[620.44s] wanted you said something back up the
[622.32s] truck I believe this I want to see if
[624.92s] you agree because I know we agree at
[626.36s] least strategically on this small caps
[628.68s] is it a backup up the truck moment yet
[630.279s] in small Caps or is it yeah yes
[633.2s] unequivocally yes and and by the way you
[635.68s] know and this feeds into the mag S as
[638.279s] well so why are we why why have we been
[640.68s] saying for months trim back the mag
[643.279s] seven get some International exposure
[645.8s] you nailed it in your a block it all
[647.72s] comes down to earnings so mag s earnings
[650.8s] growth is decelerating was 33% last year
[654.36s] going to be 16% or less this year lot of
[657.2s] capex spending unknown return on
[659.32s] investment Capital 24 right like you can
[662.2s] see that even in the cloud services
[663.76s] growth like quarter over quarter for All
[665.279s] The Bigs like you know they&#39;re making
[666.88s] continual Investments but the growth
[668.24s] rate there is just is is decelerating so
[670.8s] that&#39;s happening what&#39;s happening with
[672.399s] what I love you you I&#39;ve stolen it from
[674.2s] you I hope you don&#39;t mind it&#39;s flattery
[675.72s] right I mean I&#39;m I&#39;m copying you the UNM
[678.16s] magnificent 493 what&#39;s going on with
[680.76s] them you know I thought a lot more
[683.079s] people would steal that phrase I say it
[685.6s] every single week uh you know we do a
[688.36s] lot of the same shows together H it
[690.279s] hasn&#39;t caught on so so maybe now that
[691.959s] you say it you know you&#39;re more handsome
[693.76s] people will listen uh that would
[696.12s] incredible got a chuckle from everyone
[698.079s] here in the studio so they obviously
[699.48s] don&#39;t believe that but what yeah what&#39;s
[701.88s] the growth rates looking for them I mean
[703.48s] is it re accelerating is it stable
[705.519s] exactly so it was basically negative for
[707.32s] a couple quarters then it then it got
[709.12s] low single digits uh towards the end of
[711.079s] last year it&#39;s going to accelerate up to
[714.0s] low double digits in coming quarters
[716.279s] towards the end of the year early next
[717.68s] year while the mag 7 is decelerating so
[720.24s] there&#39;s huge opportunities under the
[721.88s] surface and small caps depending which
[724.6s] index you look at Lou uh Russell 2000
[728.2s] because they&#39;re coming off such a low
[729.519s] base 40% plus earnings growth uh small
[733.12s] caps uh S&amp;P 600 21% earnings growth you
[737.88s] can&#39;t give these away they&#39;re in the
[739.8s] gutter right now because of the Tariff
[741.72s] noise but uh that that&#39;s going to get
[743.839s] resolved welcome to Trump 2.0 same as
[746.16s] Trump 1.0 daily volatility and we go up
[749.24s] 100% I was on vanney on Monday and they
[751.56s] asked you know what do you think about
[752.68s] tariffs I&#39;m like look they&#39;re going to
[753.76s] go into effect tomorrow on Tuesday and I
[755.399s] wouldn&#39;t be surprised by Friday if
[757.36s] they&#39;re not in effect and we it took
[759.04s] till Wednesday until they started
[760.76s] repealing or revising some so I think
[762.92s] you&#39;re you&#39;re absolutely right great
[764.88s] opportunities um I want to go before we
[768.079s] we kind of close out here is what&#39;s your
[770.24s] thoughts on the fed&#39;s next move I think
[772.399s] Jerome Powell is the Rodney danger field
[774.199s] of Finance he gets absolutely no respect
[776.959s] and rightfully so CU he&#39;s screwed the
[778.44s] pooch on the front side of predicting
[780.16s] inflation but what do you think his next
[781.68s] move is in light of all the market
[783.16s] conditions well it&#39;s interesting looking
[785.24s] at today the odds of a June cut just
[789.16s] went up to
[791.12s] 85% uh you know we talk about all these
[793.36s] things that none of which were on
[794.88s] people&#39;s Bingo cards at the turn of the
[796.519s] year whether it&#39;s International
[797.639s] outperformance whether it&#39;s dollar
[799.279s] weakening whether it&#39;s yields
[800.6s] compressing or whether it&#39;s the FED now
[803.639s] cutting which you know just a few weeks
[805.56s] ago everyone saying no Cuts in 2025
[807.88s] we&#39;re g to get two cuts at least one to
[809.959s] two c so you think two I I&#39;ve been on
[812.519s] the record saying it&#39;s maybe one maybe
[814.639s] none uh that was a couple weeks ago for
[817.24s] me the big sticking points were the
[818.76s] categories of inflation that were were
[820.279s] stubbornly high so food shelter and
[823.68s] energy those are not things you can
[825.6s] quickly correct so my thesis has been
[827.72s] that look we&#39;re going to get stubbornly
[829.92s] higher inflation stuck in the three and
[831.639s] a half range and because of that that
[833.8s] you know Pal&#39;s going to have to wait but
[835.36s] you think possibly two cuts which at the
[837.56s] end of the way that fed put&#39;s going to
[838.68s] be worth while for stock investors so
[840.24s] it&#39;s a net positive for us exactly the
[843.04s] more you know look last thing I just
[844.839s] want to say keep an eye on the 10year
[848.48s] jgb yields this is the most important
[850.959s] chart that no one else is paying
[852.279s] attention to uh those are climbing
[854.959s] because the bank of Japan has to hike to
[858.04s] quell inflation which is growing after
[860.24s] 10 you know 20 years of printing money
[862.519s] crazy right like never ever do we think
[864.48s] we would be in the situation in Japan
[865.959s] with them coming off zero if you you
[869.32s] look at the last Peak was late July
[871.24s] before you had that mag seven scare in
[873.12s] early August yeah a lot of hot money has
[876.199s] come into the mag7 which is a very
[878.04s] crowded trade it&#39;s getting it&#39;s starting
[880.639s] to
[888.0s] uncrowded to quell inflation the more
[890.48s] hot money is going to come out of Mag s
[892.6s] so that&#39;s why the opportunities in UNM
[894.759s] mag 493 small caps International Etc
[898.88s] does doesn&#39;t mean you have to get out of
[900.12s] these great businesses it just means uh
[903.12s] more moderation and I think that&#39;s the
[905.959s] going to be a theme in opportunity in
[907.759s] 2025 for sure listen man you mentioned a
[910.079s] bingo card I don&#39;t know that you&#39;re old
[911.36s] enough to be playing bingo man we&#39;re not
[912.8s] there yet don&#39;t don&#39;t don&#39;t accelerate
[914.6s] or race to Florida um I I want to I want
[917.959s] to yeah DOD who you&#39;ll meet in the DB
[920.16s] block the dod block is from Florida so
[922.56s] um man I want to thank you I knew it
[924.0s] would be a great conversation I want to
[925.399s] you know we have a little differencing

[1074.36s] many things along the way and that&#39;s

[1080.52s] well and uh let&#39;s go small caps thanks
[1083.559s] buddy all right
[1085.88s] Budd and we&#39;re back and I want to
[1089.919s] reemphasize something that is critically
[1092.159s] important that I covered with Lou and
[1095.0s] that is uh the most important chart that
[1099.96s] no one is paying attention to uh and I
[1103.36s] posted this on
[1105.28s] Twitter so you can see it here
[1109.4s] uh this is the uh Japanese 10-year bond
[1113.559s] yield at 152 and I found it comical all
[1117.24s] day uh every single major commentator
[1120.96s] was blaming Tech being down 3% on
[1126.48s] tariffs which has nothing to do with it
[1128.96s] whatsoever and what what we really have
[1131.12s] happening and you&#39;re seeing it as the
[1133.84s] 10-year yield has been going down one
[1137.2s] thing that people haven&#39;t been paying
[1138.96s] attention to is European bond yields
[1142.559s] blowing out and more importantly the
[1145.76s] Japanese 10-year yield this is the key
[1148.32s] to the markets continues to go up and
[1151.799s] what that means is the carry trade is
[1155.2s] unwinding as the boj has to now raise
[1158.52s] rates to fight off inflation from 20
[1161.12s] continuous years of printing
[1163.08s] money um uh the free money is drying up
[1166.36s] and a lot of that hot free money that
[1169.159s] they were able to borrow in Yen for free
[1171.48s] and buy Mag 7 the most crowded trade in
[1174.32s] the world is now evaporating as capital
[1178.0s] has a cost it&#39;s coming out of the
[1180.36s] overvalued pockets of the market and
[1182.6s] finding undervalued pockets of the
[1184.919s] market like China uh you know whether
[1188.6s] it&#39;s Baba up 65% year-to date whether
[1191.559s] it&#39;s kweb up uh 25% Europe up 15%
[1196.08s] Etc um uh that Trend will continue that
[1201.799s] said it would not Shock me to see a
[1205.36s] bounce in the mag 7 what we said for
[1208.84s] 2025 was that mag 7 would underperform
[1212.4s] index us index returns would be subdued
[1215.84s] because mag 7 is such an incredibly High
[1219.52s] weight uh and for you know a huge
[1222.799s] opportunity under the surface in UNM
[1224.32s] magnificent 493 but much more so in
[1227.72s] international and also believe uh on the
[1230.64s] Tailwind is going to be small cap you
[1233.039s] got to pay attention to that but amazing
[1235.32s] mag s down
[1237.52s] 7.7% uh and um so keep an eye as long as
[1242.12s] that those jgb yields keep going up
[1245.28s] you&#39;re going to see continued pressure
[1247.039s] on mag 7 I think we&#39;re due for a
[1249.76s] technical bounce here on mag s they
[1252.48s] could even go as high as the top of
[1254.32s] their recent range I wouldn&#39;t bet on it
[1256.559s] but it wouldn&#39;t surprise me um uh and
[1259.24s] then we&#39;re going to get through that
[1260.88s] period of seasonality that we&#39;ve
[1263.32s] discussed in many uh of the last podcast
[1267.08s] where February and the first two weeks
[1269.32s] of March in a postelection year is very
[1272.32s] weak and then you get a monstrous uh uh
[1276.0s] uh kind of rally in late March all the
[1278.76s] way through May June uh and I that would
[1281.84s] not surprise me whatsoever earnings
[1283.799s] growth coming in at
[1286.159s] 18.2% this quarter keeping Ane on GDP
[1290.84s] down uh GDP now is estimated to come in
[1293.919s] at negative -2.4 the other thing that
[1295.919s] few people are paying attention to is
[1297.84s] now uh uh fed fund Futures 85% chance of
[1302.24s] a cut in June which is why I was uh
[1305.4s] leaning with L to one to two
[1308.88s] cuts um and uh 10year yield and and US
[1312.6s] dollar continues to fall which favors
[1316.08s] International then I had the pleasure to
[1319.4s] join uh Kai Hoffman on sore financially
[1324.36s] for his podcast uh a few days back and
[1328.4s] we&#39;re going to listen in here every
[1330.64s] single dip in Alibaba we bought because
[1332.96s] it was the cheapest amount of value for
[1335.4s] the highest earnings growth and upside
[1338.279s] opportunity and uh when it turns it
[1340.64s] turns all at once and you know yeah 60%
[1343.039s] in a few weeks but it&#39;s early days for
[1345.039s] the China trade for years uh politicians
[1348.64s] have been substantiating their existence
[1350.72s] by creating more and more regulation
[1352.919s] putting more and more Governors against
[1355.4s] growth uh and um and and Trump is
[1359.36s] throwing that playbook
[1361.81s] [Music]
[1365.279s] out hello and welcome to sore
[1368.24s] financially a channel where we discuss
[1370.2s] the macro to understand the micro my
[1372.679s] name is Kai Hoffman I&#39;m the Ed Jr mining
[1374.52s] guy over on X and of course I&#39;m your

[1391.679s] ideas on where to invest over 2025 what
[1394.48s] is he looking at and what are some of
[1396.279s] the ideas that he&#39;s following really
[1397.919s] looking forward to this discussion um
[1400.2s] before I switch over to my guest please
[1401.88s] be reminded to hit that like And
[1403.159s] subscribe button helps us out
[1404.64s] tremendously we much appreciate it and
[1407.159s] thank you for it so Tom it is great to
[1409.559s] have you on the program it&#39;s good to see
[1410.76s] you thank you so much for joining us
[1412.48s] thanks for having me Kai glad to be here
[1414.48s] yeah really looking forward to this a
[1416.0s] bit of a different perspective on what
[1417.4s] we usually talk about so we&#39;re we&#39;re
[1418.88s] really going to keep it mainstream
[1421.48s] almost like it&#39;s called mainstream
[1423.919s] because we were just chatting and you
[1425.0s] said oh you&#39;re gold Focus Channel I was
[1426.799s] like yeah but we&#39;re trying to widen the
[1428.279s] audience a little bit and just cover
[1430.0s] topics that a I&#39;m maybe personally not
[1431.88s] as strong in but also interested is just
[1434.08s] the general markets and you touched on a
[1435.76s] couple topics Emerging Markets small cap
[1438.64s] indices like really looking forward to
[1440.4s] learning more about that Tom um but
[1442.84s] before we get to that we we really got
[1444.4s] to start at a high level I&#39;m going to
[1445.96s] ask you since you&#39;re a First Time guest
[1447.36s] on the program like what&#39;s your current
[1448.919s] assessment of the economy and the
[1450.24s] financial
[1451.2s] markets I think on balance the economy
[1454.84s] is strong earnings are very strong we
[1458.32s] just got through earning season for Q4
[1461.2s] the the bulk of it is done uh
[1464.679s] 16.9% earnings growth which is
[1466.919s] phenomenal uh that&#39;s the good news the
[1468.76s] bad news is guidance has been a little
[1471.12s] weaker than expected and S&amp;P earnings
[1474.0s] have come down expectations for this
[1476.039s] year from you know 275 for the S&amp;P down
[1479.96s] to like below 270 some shops are at
[1483.559s] 268 uh but it&#39;s not terribly concerning
[1486.72s] because this is the part of the year
[1489.12s] that I like to refer to as sandbagger
[1492.48s] season meaning uh seasonally uh CEOs
[1497.24s] tend to take down guidance in the first
[1499.52s] quarter to set expectations low so they
[1502.0s] can beat for the subsequent three
[1504.279s] quarters and I think that that will be
[1506.0s] no different this year it&#39;s where we are
[1508.52s] we&#39;re in the normal late February
[1511.679s] volatility chop uh that we see not only
[1515.279s] most years as February is the second
[1517.159s] worst month of the year but we see in a
[1520.08s] pronounced way postelection years on
[1522.72s] average since 1950 the S&amp;P is down 1.3%
[1527.72s] in February so here we are uh you know a
[1530.799s] handful of more days and then we&#39;ll
[1532.64s] probably start to find a bid on some
[1534.6s] some of the stocks that have been
[1536.2s] hammered oh absolutely no it&#39;s a you
[1538.6s] know seasonality is a big factor we we
[1540.24s] can get to that but uh I I got a burning
[1542.64s] question here like 16.9% earnings like
[1545.32s] growth where does it come
[1547.48s] from yeah it&#39;s it&#39;s been pretty broad
[1550.52s] you know the the whole theme for
[1553.48s] 2025 that we&#39;ve been talking about for
[1556.36s] you know a number of months on our our
[1558.399s] podcast and our public appearances has
[1561.24s] been the mag mag Magnificent Seven
[1564.76s] earnings that drove the bus in
[1567.279s] 2024 uh is De decelerating dramatically
[1571.039s] in 2025 so you had magnificent s grow
[1574.399s] earnings in 2024 at about
[1577.159s] 33% and what outperformed in 2024
[1580.32s] magnificent 7 it&#39;s not a mystery uh the
[1583.559s] problem is and the dichotomy in the
[1585.84s] market is this year earning growth for
[1588.919s] the mag 7 are going to decelerate from
[1592.44s] 33% down to now it&#39;s about 16% almost
[1596.6s] half and the real problem is the
[1598.919s] multiples have not compressed
[1602.32s] commensurate with the D celeration in
[1605.6s] earnings growth so multiples have stayed
[1607.6s] up they&#39;re starting to come in a little
[1609.76s] bit but you know if you look at the rest
[1611.44s] of the market their earnings growth is
[1614.279s] going to accelerate from you know uh 3 3
[1618.64s] 4% last year to you know 13 14 15% and
[1623.72s] the multiple is a lot lower maybe 16 17
[1627.24s] times 18 times versus the MA 7 at 33
[1630.159s] times so I think people are figuring
[1632.159s] this out and they&#39;re reallocating which
[1634.399s] is why the mag 7 is down over one and a
[1638.279s] half% year to date while uh the S&amp;P is
[1641.76s] up to and change uh and some of the
[1644.159s] laggards from last year like materials
[1646.559s] and healthc Care are up you know five
[1648.52s] six seven percent year-to
[1650.799s] dat let&#39;s break that down even more so
[1653.32s] you&#39;re you&#39;re talking materials is
[1654.919s] growing there must be some consumer
[1657.039s] confidence and uh perfect topic for
[1660.32s] today cuz I wrote down consumer
[1662.159s] confidence missed expectations like yeah
[1665.76s] how does that fit together like when you
[1667.2s] see materials meanings like okay I can
[1669.159s] spend money on Home Improvement and
[1671.0s] other things I hope I&#39;m interpreting
[1672.799s] this right uh Tom but like where&#39;s that
[1675.159s] confidence coming from that we&#39;re not
[1676.279s] seeing in the numbers
[1678.64s] yeah so the consumer confidence is
[1680.64s] largely a function of a number of things
[1683.12s] uh number one is tariff fears people
[1686.32s] have uh been fed this narrative that
[1690.48s] tariffs will lead to sustainable
[1693.6s] inflation uh history doesn&#39;t bear that
[1695.84s] out it&#39;s a one time so let&#39;s say
[1697.799s] hypothetically all the tariffs that are
[1699.64s] promised go into place and it&#39;s 25% it&#39;s
[1702.64s] a one-time bump it&#39;s not 25% compounded
[1705.96s] at 3% per year uh and that&#39;s not that&#39;s
[1709.72s] not the way it works so what you find as
[1711.519s] you saw in 2018 with washing machines
[1714.36s] you get a short-term bump in price you
[1716.159s] look intermediate term a year later uh
[1719.08s] they&#39;re kind of flat and then you know
[1721.159s] two years out they&#39;re actually down uh
[1724.32s] so people are are worried about the
[1725.88s] uncertainty of tariffs they&#39;re worried a
[1728.12s] little bit about inflation which by the
[1730.519s] way this time of year the January
[1733.08s] reports and the February reports tend to
[1735.24s] come in a little hotter seasonally so
[1738.6s] you know the last inflation reports were
[1740.88s] a little concerning for people but that
[1742.88s] is normal for this time of the year uh
[1747.039s] and I think a lot of this will be put
[1749.039s] behind us that said uh are people
[1752.24s] reallocating to where they can get more
[1754.519s] more earnings growth for a lower
[1756.72s] multiple you bet and we&#39;re seeing the
[1758.64s] move in particular into International
[1762.12s] stocks which are dramatically
[1764.0s] outperforming uh you know S&amp;P up two in
[1766.559s] change
[1768.24s] European equities up 10% that was on no
[1770.72s] one&#39;s Bingo cards coming into the year
[1772.96s] and emerging markets in China Emerging
[1775.559s] Markets up 7 and a half percent and
[1777.159s] China absolutely flying China Tech uh
[1780.24s] and that&#39;s our largest position and
[1782.2s] we&#39;ve been building that you know it&#39;s
[1783.48s] not like we just picked it five weeks
[1785.159s] and it went straight up I mean we&#39;ve
[1786.519s] been building that position for two
[1788.0s] years every single dip in Alibaba we
[1791.2s] bought because it was the cheapest
[1793.08s] amount of value for the highest earnings
[1795.84s] growth and upside opportunity and
[1798.559s] uh when it turns it turns all at once
[1800.36s] and you know yeah 60% in a few weeks but
[1802.799s] it&#39;s early days for the China trade very
[1805.76s] early days it&#39;s as as things seem to be
[1807.6s] calming down uh towards or like to the
[1810.32s] aggression towards China seems to be
[1811.64s] calming down a little bit I don&#39;t know
[1813.159s] that&#39;s again got feeling that&#39;s what I&#39;m
[1814.64s] sensing and you&#39;re sort of confirming it
[1816.519s] I I want to get to Alibaba L when we
[1818.24s] talk more tech stocks and like
[1819.799s] investment ideas um I want to stay on
[1821.84s] the fundamentals for now and I know
[1823.559s] we&#39;re going to get a lot of flak and
[1824.72s] people turning off when you said the
[1826.919s] economy is strong because my audience
[1828.84s] believes the economy is weak it&#39;s
[1830.559s] weakening um and there are definitely
[1832.399s] cracks in the system um visible and it
[1835.44s] seems like there&#39;s a bit of a uh
[1837.44s] discrepancy uh there was an article in
[1839.12s] the Wall Street Journal that I discussed
[1840.44s] with another guest the other day where
[1842.36s] like 10% of the spending or sorry the
[1844.559s] 10% are doing most of the spending while
[1847.0s] 90% the spending is going down
[1848.88s] dramatically um if I if I find it I&#39;ll
[1851.24s] bring it up in a second but I&#39;m curious
[1853.32s] like how where break that down like the
[1856.08s] economy is strong like what what do you
[1857.6s] base
[1858.44s] yeah so look I mean you had uh two
[1862.279s] recessions in two years in
[1865.48s] 2020 during covid you had two negative
[1868.279s] quarters of GDP growth or lack thereof
[1871.36s] and you in 2022 they never called it a
[1874.08s] recession but you had two quarters of NE
[1877.48s] consecutive quarters of negative GDP
[1879.36s] growth right now our GDP growth
[1881.76s] depending what trackers you look at but
[1883.44s] let&#39;s just say Atlanta fed GDP now is at
[1886.12s] 2.3% Goldman&#39;s a little more bearish at
[1888.919s] 1.9% you don&#39;t get a recession with
[1892.88s] positive GDP okay so whether it comes in
[1895.159s] at one and a half or two and a half it&#39;s
[1896.919s] really IMM material the key is it&#39;s
[1899.039s] growing despite the headwinds now to
[1901.2s] your point are people at the lower end
[1904.0s] of the economic spectrum uh struggling a
[1907.559s] little bit yes we we see all the data
[1909.679s] we&#39;re not blind to the default rate
[1911.72s] going up on credit cards a little bit on
[1913.679s] auto loans uh and and the like you&#39;ve
[1916.639s] had rates go up dramatically and you&#39;ve
[1918.519s] had people that became accustomed that
[1921.08s] weren&#39;t accustomed to being able to
[1922.519s] spend a lot of discretionary money that
[1924.159s] were you know force-fed checks from the
[1926.48s] government and got used to spending and
[1928.08s] eating out and doing all those things so
[1930.32s] when the money dried up they kept it
[1931.799s] going on their credit card so yeah
[1933.24s] there&#39;s going to be some pain at the low
[1935.12s] end but that you know that&#39;s that&#39;s been
[1937.36s] the bell curve since day one and uh not
[1940.36s] only did the top
[1941.639s] 10% uh percent make up you know 50% or
[1945.24s] more of the spending uh they pay a ton
[1947.72s] of the taxes so it&#39;s always been that
[1950.6s] way it&#39;s probably going to be that way
[1952.32s] but what I will say is that in Trump
[1956.919s] 1.0 uh the lower and middle class did a
[1962.039s] lot better than they did under Biden and
[1965.76s] they were really starting in terms of
[1967.679s] employment rates among minorities in
[1970.159s] terms of real wages
[1972.88s] increasing uh in terms of all that that
[1975.88s] group did the best and I think that&#39;s
[1978.12s] going to be the case in Trump 2.0 so if
[1981.36s] the cost of that is a little volatility
[1983.48s] in the US indices and for those of you
[1986.039s] who are in exclusively passive indexing
[1988.48s] in the S&amp;P 500 you&#39;re going to feel it
[1990.72s] because the mag 7 is you know 35% weight
[1994.6s] of that and their earnings are
[1996.32s] decelerating their capex is going up
[1998.36s] their margins are going to uh start to
[2001.12s] feel that if if they don&#39;t get the
[2003.32s] return which I don&#39;t think anyone
[2004.72s] expects in the next three to four
[2006.0s] quarters to see a return on the $300
[2008.32s] billion doll of AI investment uh and um
[2011.76s] and you just have to adjust but on
[2013.84s] balance I think as we get through the
[2016.159s] fear of the tar tariffs and the reality
[2018.559s] or lack thereof of the tariffs uh I
[2021.96s] think you&#39;re going to find that uh doge
[2025.6s] is very efficient in cutting costs which
[2027.639s] is
[2028.76s] deflationary that is going to offset a
[2031.36s] lot of the fears around inflation and
[2034.24s] the 10-year yield is telling you exactly
[2036.76s] that&#39;s going to happen which is why you
[2039.519s] saw in the last few quarters couple of
[2043.0s] quarters uh that hedge funds were the
[2046.24s] most short the 10year treasury than
[2049.359s] they&#39;ve been since late
[2052.28s] 2018 and that was the period that
[2055.2s] preceded one of the biggest Bond rallies
[2058.119s] in the shortest period of time yields
[2059.76s] compressed I think we&#39;re going to see
[2061.399s] the exact same thing the smart Money
[2063.2s] commercials are short are long bonds uh
[2067.399s] very long Bonds longest since 2018 and
[2069.76s] that&#39;s why you&#39;re seeing the 10-year get
[2072.0s] bid yields are starting to compress the
[2074.639s] exact opposite of what everyone was
[2076.879s] calling for a few weeks ago when the 10e
[2079.48s] yield was at 480 and everyone said it
[2081.04s] was going to five and we were out
[2082.399s] publicly and said nope it&#39;s going to
[2083.919s] four I think we&#39;re going to four and we
[2085.96s] may not even stop at four we&#39;re going to
[2087.72s] see a three handle which is going to
[2089.2s] shock a lot of people and that is going
[2091.24s] to Spur a level of growth not in mag
[2094.159s] 7even but in things like Auto industry
[2097.359s] in things like homeb building which has
[2099.839s] gotten left for dead in things like
[2102.4s] homeb building suppliers uh tool
[2105.44s] producers like Stanley Black and&amp; Decker
[2108.24s] which is one of our our positions like
[2111.0s] JRA which has 75% of the home standby
[2114.52s] generator this is the kind of stuff
[2116.72s] that&#39;s not sexy today because everyone
[2118.64s] wants to chase what&#39;s up the shiny
[2120.52s] objects and they&#39;re getting their heads
[2121.96s] handed to them but it&#39;s going to be sexy
[2124.76s] 6 n months from now when everyone is
[2127.04s] getting excited about DeWalt
[2129.4s] construction tools mark my words uh that
[2132.599s] will be a funny day and maybe I&#39;ll be
[2134.68s] back to celebrate a little bit of that
[2136.2s] with you doesn&#39;t doesn&#39;t S you know it
[2139.079s] it reminds me an awful lot of when
[2141.72s] everyone was pounding the table that
[2143.4s] China was uninvestable and we were
[2145.2s] pounding the table to buy it you know
[2147.599s] backing up the truck in the 60s when
[2149.76s] Morgan Stanley was downgrading in the
[2151.52s] hole and maybe you saw it this week up
[2153.8s] 100% from there and uh now they&#39;re
[2156.2s] upgrading China stocks I mean you can&#39;t
[2158.04s] make this stuff up no clear direction to
[2161.0s] be quite honest bit flip-flopping in the
[2162.52s] wind um I just quickly want to share
[2164.319s] that chart with you that that I found
[2166.2s] and uh you know the US consumer is is
[2169.28s] really really hurting just looking at
[2170.839s] cumulative excess savings that&#39;s from
[2172.72s] the article I mentioned and I&#39;m not sure
[2174.88s] if you can see that Tom but uh top 10%
[2176.96s] of earners roughly savings 1.3 trillion
[2179.28s] the other 90% of earners only have $291
[2182.119s] billion saved anymore we all know that
[2184.4s] the US consumer is not a really a big
[2186.28s] saver savings rate in the US is
[2188.839s] 3.8% but we&#39;re trending toward zero here
[2192.079s] you know and the question is like when
[2193.319s] do we hit the panic button when are we
[2195.079s] in like fullon Eco trouble mode um you
[2198.839s] know right now everything seems fine I
[2200.599s] do agree like the numbers are not lying
[2202.68s] yes there&#39;s a Divergence and we&#39;re
[2204.599s] seeing trouble ahead and everybody feels
[2207.2s] it differently a little bit depending as
[2209.599s] this shows like what income level you&#39;re
[2211.68s] in um right now as well like the
[2213.48s] disparity is just getting bigger the
[2215.28s] question is like when are we going to
[2216.68s] see and I&#39;m like purposely overstating
[2219.44s] it but when are we going to see like
[2220.92s] riots in the
[2222.04s] streets yeah never not not anytime soon
[2224.96s] I mean the Chinese were the closest to
[2227.119s] having riots in the street and that&#39;s
[2228.64s] why they went from you know hunting down
[2230.92s] out you know Jack ma to wanting to
[2232.96s] basically put him in PR prison two years
[2234.88s] ago to now inviting him to meet with
[2237.079s] xinping and shaking his hand and giving
[2238.96s] him an award at the most recent uh CEO
[2241.8s] conference in China so uh I&#39;d be more
[2244.56s] worried about the risk she really push
[2247.52s] pushed it up to the edge he had 20% of
[2249.72s] 25 year olds with education unemployed
[2252.52s] that&#39;s that&#39;s a formula for a tan square
[2255.48s] and he was able to Pivot just in time
[2258.68s] because you saw the the protesting
[2261.079s] increasing around the country and now
[2263.0s] he&#39;s flipped everyone&#39;s got says okay
[2265.56s] the guy had a huge tolerance for pain
[2267.72s] he&#39;s flipped the switch and now we&#39;re
[2269.04s] back off to the races in China so so
[2271.16s] that&#39;s in the rearview mirror now what
[2272.96s] you&#39;re what you&#39;re blinded not you but
[2275.52s] the person who uh constructed this chart
[2277.68s] and article are blinded by is the fact
[2279.92s] that this is no different than anytime
[2281.4s] else what they&#39;re comparing it to is a
[2283.76s] one once in 100y year aberation when the
[2286.44s] government decided to pump the money
[2288.16s] pump the economy full of s trillion
[2290.16s] dollars and put it in the hands of
[2291.96s] people who historically are not Savers
[2294.56s] and uh and they&#39;ve proven to the point
[2296.88s] that they&#39;re still not Savers because
[2298.88s] they spent it as fast as they could now
[2300.599s] that it&#39;s running out they&#39;re going back
[2301.96s] to their normal savings level pre
[2304.16s] pandemic which was effectively zero and
[2306.76s] that&#39;s the way it&#39;s always been and uh
[2309.2s] it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s just you know it&#39;s not a
[2311.64s] commentary good or bad it&#39;s just the way
[2313.88s] it is uh as far as whether they&#39;ll
[2316.24s] they&#39;ll uh they&#39;ll be discontent related
[2318.72s] to that I think that uh you&#39;re going to
[2321.599s] see an
[2323.119s] acceleration of real wages and growth in
[2326.48s] the economy uh and productivity like you
[2329.599s] saw in Trump 1.0 in Trump 2.0 in coming
[2333.0s] quarters and they will be the primary
[2335.16s] beneficiary so while they&#39;re not saving
[2336.92s] I think you&#39;re going to see their wages
[2338.68s] continue to creep up uh and um and and
[2343.599s] uh but but as far as them Having excess
[2346.24s] savings the last five years was the
[2348.24s] exception not the rule yeah no
[2350.839s] absolutely because we gave them free
[2352.079s] money like corre that uh like to to to
[2355.04s] quote somebody like somebody&#39;s probably
[2356.48s] I think Adam tager mentions that a lot
[2358.0s] like the pick is through the python like
[2359.88s] I think the pick has been digested
[2361.88s] almost and uh excrement it I don&#39;t know
[2364.68s] like correct and look you&#39;ll have credit
[2366.68s] card defaults that level I mean that&#39;s
[2369.0s] that&#39;s nothing new it h it happens every
[2371.119s] single cycle but if you look at high
[2372.56s] yield credit spreads which is what I pay
[2374.28s] attention to if you want to worry about
[2376.16s] if the world is coming to an end worry
[2378.2s] about high yield credit spreads and
[2379.64s] right now they&#39;re telling you uh all is
[2381.839s] Quiet on the Western Front it could
[2383.599s] change tomorrow but for now it&#39;s in good
[2386.119s] stead and if companies can refinance
[2388.52s] their debt and they can hit the capital
[2390.44s] markets all is
[2391.88s] well talk about inflation and wage
[2394.0s] growth I think that&#39;s an interesting
[2395.119s] combination I how worried are you about
[2397.64s] inflation in general and wage growth is
[2399.68s] roughly at 5.7% as we&#39;re you know I
[2402.52s] checked last week it might be different
[2403.72s] now but roughly around 5.7% like how how
[2406.8s] does that fit together are you worried
[2408.2s] about that is that too too much like how
[2410.4s] does that fit together yeah I mean look
[2413.76s] uh Elon Musk is basically firing anyone
[2416.28s] with a pulse that&#39;s willing to leave uh
[2418.68s] in the in the public sector I think it&#39;s
[2421.839s] you know probably in some sense maybe
[2424.24s] they&#39;ll overshoot and have to rehire
[2425.72s] some people but in some sense it&#39;s long
[2427.44s] overdue the issue is going to be uh
[2429.88s] whether or not the bulk of the people
[2432.0s] who have had jobs in the public sector
[2435.0s] uh will or will not be absorbed by the
[2437.16s] private SE sector I.E does their skill
[2440.04s] set translate to Value ad which is
[2442.16s] required in the private sector and the
[2444.079s] answer is we don&#39;t know yet so I think
[2446.44s] what you&#39;re going to see is a tick up in
[2448.44s] the unemployment rate uh which will be
[2450.92s] offsetting the inflationary Tendencies
[2453.92s] you&#39;re going to see deflation from the
[2456.48s] decreased government spending you&#39;re
[2458.599s] going to see inflation from some of the
[2461.72s] other parts of the economy um you know
[2464.64s] rents are still elevated uh housing is
[2467.359s] still elevated but what as bessent and
[2471.0s] Trump execute on their plan to bring the
[2472.96s] 10e yield down why would they focus on
[2475.64s] that versus the short end of the curve
[2477.56s] they focus on that because all mortgages
[2479.4s] are priced off of that all long-term
[2481.92s] loans are priced off of that and their
[2484.079s] ability to refinance the US debt is
[2485.96s] priced off of that and finally the go
[2488.52s] the foreigners who invest in the US
[2490.76s] treasuries are looking to see some
[2493.2s] semblance of fiscal responsibility and
[2496.64s] cutting costs so that they can have
[2498.72s] confidence uh to own hold our debt and
[2502.359s] and we are showing clear steps in that
[2505.88s] direction uh we will get to hundreds of
[2509.24s] billions I don&#39;t know whether we&#39;ll get
[2511.28s] to a trillion or two trillion for sure I
[2514.68s] bet against it but the key is Direction
[2516.92s] and perception and right now that&#39;s
[2518.88s] moving in the right direction right now
[2520.76s] that is a deflationary factor offsetting
[2523.96s] the natural inflationary factors we I
[2526.2s] think the number one thing is they&#39;re
[2527.52s] going to have to be careful because at
[2530.119s] 120% debt to GDP we have not been at
[2533.24s] this level since post World War II
[2537.359s] 1948 and how did they bring debt to GDP
[2541.96s] down from 120% down to 63 by 1956
[2547.4s] it&#39;s very simple they ran nominal growth
[2549.52s] hot GDP ran hot and inflation ran above
[2553.04s] Trend call it three to four and a half
[2555.96s] percent over that time period above
[2558.4s] their 2% Target uh and I think we&#39;re
[2561.16s] going to have to run it at that level
[2562.64s] this time and if they do too much on the
[2564.64s] government spending front uh those
[2567.0s] deflationary headwinds could offset the
[2569.68s] needed inflation we need to bring debt
[2572.52s] to GDP down to a more normalized range
[2576.8s] uh you look at all the productivity
[2579.0s] factors that are coming into play
[2580.839s] Workforce productivity is increasing for
[2583.28s] a first time in a long time and is going
[2585.68s] to continue accelerate with some of the
[2588.52s] Technologies uh that&#39;s going to be super
[2590.839s] positive for nominal growth I think it
[2593.559s] was Jensen Wong out there talking about
[2595.8s] the possibility of 10% GDP growth I mean
[2599.04s] that&#39;s a little bit uh crazy town but
[2601.319s] you know you&#39;d be amazed what CEOs will
[2603.24s] say when they&#39;re selling stock at highs
[2605.96s] and uh trying to get get people to keep
[2608.44s] the bid in but uh leaving that aside um
[2612.72s] on balance there are Crosswinds but um
[2616.0s] constructive for at least the
[2617.839s] foreseeable 12 to 24 months that doesn&#39;t
[2620.28s] preclude normal five to 10% Corrections
[2622.92s] we get on average 3 5% pullbacks a year
[2625.64s] you know one 10% correction every year
[2627.839s] in change one 12% correction every 4.1
[2631.04s] years so uh but we did have two of those
[2634.119s] 20% plus Corrections in two years so we
[2637.119s] may have pulled forward a few years of
[2638.76s] those bare markets uh in 2020 and 2022
[2643.2s] and maybe we&#39;ve got some blue sky for
[2645.28s] maybe a few more years than people
[2646.76s] anticipate right
[2648.16s] now we definitely don&#39;t anticipate it
[2650.68s] especially on our Channel like we like
[2652.88s] we always talk look look for the
[2654.16s] negatives of course maybe because I&#39;m
[2655.64s] German as well we always look for the
[2657.079s] negatives right but uh like I don&#39;t want
[2660.16s] to say we&#39;re doom and gloom Channel but
[2661.44s] we&#39;re trying to figure out what is
[2662.48s] happening and we all know that the debt
[2664.599s] as is is not sustainable especially
[2666.48s] interest payment we need to we don&#39;t
[2667.96s] need to go into that but we&#39;re all I&#39;ll
[2669.72s] let you in on a little secret Kai uh uh
[2673.64s] Doom and Gloom gets more views so uh so
[2676.0s] if that&#39;s the goal uh I would stick with
[2678.04s] the
[2679.4s] theme good point good point no no
[2682.119s] absolutely um you you touched on it like
[2684.92s] the next topic like I really want to
[2686.24s] talk about how can we get GDP running
[2687.96s] hot again like how do we get to the 10%
[2689.92s] that Jensen W suggested and that you
[2692.04s] quoted him saying that is actually
[2693.76s] already an indication of where things
[2695.359s] might be heading is it AI is it new
[2697.68s] technology really pushing that like it
[2699.559s] seems like the US really is betting big
[2701.559s] on AI to save itself meaning like we&#39;ll
[2704.64s] have to get GDP up if we can&#39;t get debt
[2706.599s] under control we have to get GDP up to
[2708.28s] keep that ratio somewhat in check is AI
[2710.8s] Our Savior Tom I think I think it&#39;s part
[2713.88s] of the fact I think that&#39;s part of the
[2715.68s] formula I think uh we&#39;ve seen an
[2718.88s] increase in productivity but the number
[2721.2s] one thing that people don&#39;t talk enough
[2723.359s] about which really helped in Trump 1.0
[2726.44s] is passive
[2728.4s] deregulation you know for every new
[2730.559s] regulation I think his rule is he&#39;s got
[2732.48s] to cut four old regulations and you have
[2736.359s] no
[2737.16s] idea the amount of Ingenuity and
[2740.04s] productivity that can be Unleashed when
[2741.8s] you just take the governor off the
[2744.119s] accelerator and for years uh politicians
[2748.4s] have been substantiating their existence
[2750.44s] by creating more and more regulation
[2752.68s] putting more and more Governors against
[2755.4s] growth uh and and um and and Trump is
[2759.119s] throwing that playbook out and he&#39;s
[2761.48s] going to unleash American Ingenuity and
[2764.52s] American creativity and American
[2767.079s] productivity by just letting business
[2769.28s] run and yeah some will run too far and
[2772.16s] they&#39;ll have to be corrected but he&#39;s a
[2774.76s] believer of the self-correcting
[2776.4s] mechanism of the markets and uh and and
[2779.92s] you don&#39;t need a nanny state to tell
[2782.359s] everyone what to do in every single
[2784.64s] aspect of their business certainly you
[2786.28s] have to have
[2787.48s] uh uh guide rails and uh a core set of
[2791.2s] rules but the acceleration of the
[2793.64s] regulation has just uh really hindered
[2796.0s] growth and put us at a level that um
[2800.16s] we&#39;re still a small country you know 330
[2802.44s] million people uh certainly the largest
[2805.119s] uh uh GDP and production but I I think
[2807.68s] we could grow a lot faster if we Unleash
[2810.48s] the Beast and uh and that&#39;s what Trump
[2812.599s] did in Trump in 1.0 and we saw the
[2814.92s] results and and I think that&#39;s what
[2816.24s] we&#39;re going to see in 2.0 it&#39;s not going
[2818.64s] to be tomorrow but it&#39;s probably going
[2820.079s] to be in a few quarters you&#39;re going to
[2821.68s] start to see it and you see it in CEO
[2823.96s] confidence numbers their confidence
[2826.44s] levels in in the future outlook which
[2829.24s] were at uh very depressed levels in
[2832.599s] 2024 uh in terms of investing in terms
[2835.319s] of growth in terms of confidence uh it&#39;s
[2838.599s] and and what banks are going to be able
[2840.24s] to do in terms of lending as they start
[2842.28s] to ease up some of the uh uh
[2844.559s] restrictions on banks again so I think
[2847.44s] that people are really uh have to be
[2850.359s] careful about looking in the rear view
[2853.079s] mirror and getting caught up in recency
[2856.0s] bias meaning um thinking that what has
[2859.8s] happened in the recent past is going to
[2862.0s] persist into the future and actually
[2864.079s] zooming out and looking a little further
[2866.16s] back and see what happened during
[2868.48s] different periods of history when a
[2870.96s] different set of conditions and a
[2873.119s] different Playbook was put into play and
[2875.96s] uh and the periods of great growth and
[2877.559s] great uh economic
[2879.48s] Prosperity no thanks for clarifying that
[2881.76s] really appreciate that like putting
[2883.319s] things into perspective here and uh one
[2885.92s] thing maybe to follow up and it&#39;s a
[2887.76s] question I&#39;ve asked earlier this week on
[2889.079s] the podcast but I personally didn&#39;t
[2890.48s] follow up on the stories project
[2891.64s] Stargate and the impact of deep seek
[2893.839s] like my my number that I had in my head
[2895.44s] was like $500 billion to be spent on AI
[2897.88s] initiatives being infrastructure and
[2899.44s] everything else um you you mentioned 300
[2901.96s] like personally I expected it to be cut
[2903.72s] lower so like your number didn&#39;t seem
[2905.4s] too far off but the question is like the
[2907.88s] impact of deep seek and uh like what do
[2910.76s] you see like and how should we sort of
[2912.64s] factor that into into future earnings as
[2914.48s] well like you touched on like earnings
[2916.8s] um you know revisions moving forward
[2919.559s] here yeah so uh the 300 billion number
[2923.599s] is just the US mag 7 for
[2926.64s] 2025 uh the Stargate project you
[2930.359s] know um masi Yoshi came out from soft
[2934.88s] Bank talking about 200 billion I mean
[2937.119s] this guy&#39;s a cowboy he&#39;s a a cat that
[2941.0s] has nine lives I mean you know he almost
[2943.119s] blew up with Wei work and flushed a ton
[2945.599s] of investors money with that and yet the
[2947.839s] guy goes out and raises billions of
[2949.48s] dollars like it&#39;s no problem and then
[2951.48s] you know a week after he promises 200
[2953.44s] billion he reports that the company lost
[2955.52s] some you know multi-billions that
[2957.839s] quarter alone so you can&#39;t make this
[2959.64s] stuff up but the point is is the
[2961.92s] direction okay and the direction is
[2963.92s] going to be in Investments it&#39;s going to
[2966.079s] be in capital pack is going to be in
[2967.44s] data centers deep seek was a game
[2969.48s] changer because what they said what they
[2971.68s] showed is that uh you can get similar or
[2975.68s] better results with a lot less money now
[2978.52s] the question is how much less money is
[2980.0s] it 95% is it 50% the point is it&#39;s less
[2983.76s] so it messed with all of the uh
[2987.119s] 25-year-old analysts Excel spreadsheets
[2990.28s] and uh it was like a you know mind blow
[2993.559s] and now everyone&#39;s reconfiguring and
[2996.4s] you&#39;re seeing Alibaba had a model quen
[2999.64s] 2.5 that beat both deep seek and open AI
[3004.2s] in performance on many if you know the
[3007.68s] majority of metrics and that&#39;s why
[3009.319s] you&#39;re seeing uh Alibaba go parabolic so
[3013.319s] I think there&#39;s going to be a tremendous
[3014.48s] amount of competition uh and the beauty
[3017.24s] of deep seek uh which I love is that
[3021.04s] some of their performance was garnered
[3024.359s] on inferior chips and when I think about
[3027.76s] inferior chips I say to myself who is
[3030.839s] the king of inferior chips is Intel okay
[3035.559s] so if they can generate performance on
[3038.559s] inferior chips at a much lower cost
[3041.16s] imagine the possibilities for inferior
[3043.4s] companies like Intel that are trading as
[3045.28s] if they&#39;re going out of business uh but
[3047.72s] if people seem to forget that they did
[3049.52s] over 50 billion dollar of Revenue in the
[3051.96s] last 12 months oh and by the way they&#39;re
[3054.559s] the only place you can get uh excess
[3057.16s] capacity you know the whole Nvidia story
[3059.96s] is very very
[3061.319s] simple um they have grown data center
[3066.68s] Revenue if you look at the last six
[3068.48s] eight quarters uh $4 billion do per
[3072.599s] quarter that sounds pretty unbelievable
[3075.44s] except for the fact that the base of the
[3078.76s] business has gotten much larger so that
[3081.64s] $4 billion dollar of Revenue growth each
[3084.88s] quarter uh a year or two ago uh equaled
[3089.88s] 250% Revenue growth today it&#39;s less than
[3094.64s] half of that and by the end of the year
[3096.839s] it will be less than
[3099.04s] 50% because that it&#39;s not necessarily a
[3103.16s] demand issue right now it&#39;s more of a
[3105.68s] supply issue and they are relying on the
[3109.28s] kindness of strangers and what I&#39;m
[3111.4s] trying to say is they are not the
[3114.319s] captain of their own ship they are
[3116.64s] completely dependent on Taiwan
[3119.04s] semiconductor&#39;s capacity to produce and
[3122.319s] Taiwan semiconductor is producing at or
[3125.76s] Beyond capacity right now which is why
[3128.16s] they are limited to four billion in
[3130.16s] growth I think Intel is going to be a
[3133.319s] solution for that down the road but in
[3136.88s] the meantime if you have a company
[3138.599s] trading at 30 times sales and 44 times
[3144.2s] earnings with d accelerating growth you
[3148.44s] have to be worried about that and with a
[3151.559s] CEO filing to sell more than a billion
[3154.839s] plus dollars in the last few months uh
[3158.4s] you know I don&#39;t watch what people say I
[3160.64s] watch what they do and that&#39;s why you&#39;ve
[3163.079s] seen negative returns for NVIDIA since
[3167.44s] June and most people would not guess
[3169.88s] that if you talk to the average Uber
[3171.599s] driver who&#39;s excited about Nvidia
[3173.799s] changing the world I don&#39;t know much
[3176.68s] about Nvidia person I don&#39;t follow their
[3178.359s] like I don&#39;t read the quarterly or
[3179.52s] anything like I know what they do
[3180.839s] obviously and I know but not in detail
[3183.359s] but it&#39;s like I&#39;m my gut feeling like I
[3185.24s] I love my gut feeling by the way but
[3186.92s] I&#39;ve been watching some YouTube channels
[3188.079s] about graphics card like they they came
[3189.76s] out with a new 50 Series recently and
[3191.839s] they&#39;re all negative like too expensive
[3195.16s] performance not really like where what
[3196.839s] they promised um MSRP is not achievable
[3200.119s] and then tariffs on top of it as well
[3202.44s] like an extra $50 for a graphics card
[3204.52s] which is supposed to be $579
[3207.28s] makes a difference right so like I&#39;d be
[3210.28s] cautious like I don&#39;t own any viia it&#39;s
[3211.92s] not part of the market I own or play and
[3214.24s] but I&#39;d be cautious personally at least
[3216.04s] like for the next quarter delivery roll
[3217.839s] out doesn&#39;t seem to be great only
[3219.599s] influencers getting graphics cards right
[3221.52s] now everything&#39;s really really
[3223.559s] interesting signs if you follow that um
[3226.52s] you you touched on Taiwan I want to take
[3228.079s] it one further I want to take one Island
[3229.68s] further east and would need to talk
[3230.96s] Japan real quick um cuz that&#39;s something
[3233.559s] we briefly discussed off air and I&#39;ve
[3235.04s] been trying to fit it in um segue really
[3237.16s] is inflation in Japan like 4% um La last
[3240.96s] month and that could really derail
[3242.96s] things for everybody meaning liquidity
[3245.48s] is is uh what do you call it like on
[3247.96s] high alert for for a lack of better term
[3249.88s] because the Yen carry trade could get
[3251.92s] unraveled here rather quickly meaning if
[3254.319s] the Japanese Central Bank decides to
[3255.96s] raise interest rates the cheap money
[3257.599s] could disappear that&#39;s been propping up
[3259.16s] the US market um correct let&#39;s let&#39;s
[3262.16s] talk about that a little bit and how
[3263.559s] much of a risk do you see there
[3266.64s] well all you need to do is look at
[3268.119s] inflation numbers and look at what the
[3270.28s] uh Bank of Japan has been doing
[3272.24s] inflation has been going up and Bank of
[3273.799s] Japan has been hiking uh and they&#39;ve
[3275.92s] been trying to hold back hiking as much
[3277.68s] as they can because of what happened in
[3279.4s] August uh and they haven&#39;t been able to
[3281.559s] so they&#39;re going to continue to hike
[3282.88s] inflation&#39;s going to continue to go up
[3284.64s] why because they&#39;ve been printing money
[3286.0s] since I can remember and
[3289.4s] um and I think what&#39;s going to happen is
[3292.92s] uh that that free what most people don&#39;t
[3294.96s] realize is a lot of
[3297.599s] the um support Behind The Magnificent
[3301.079s] Seven trade one was attributable to
[3303.359s] earnings which are now decelerating uh
[3305.88s] and two was attributable to free money
[3307.839s] exactly as you hit that nail on the head
[3310.0s] Kai uh in that that is now going to
[3313.04s] shrivel up because uh
[3315.44s] as as uh the jgbs start to have higher
[3319.359s] and higher yields there&#39;s a cost of of
[3321.88s] holding that position and people are
[3323.68s] going to say well now you know when when
[3325.28s] money is free like it was in 2022 you
[3327.96s] know when the FED fund rate was a lot
[3329.24s] lower what did you see you just saw
[3330.92s] people throwing money at Venture Capital
[3333.079s] anything that had startup people were
[3335.079s] throwing money at in 2020 2021 and then
[3338.52s] 2022 the chickens came home to roost
[3341.079s] well it&#39;s not that much different with
[3343.799s] with the carry trade free money now
[3345.2s] drying up that that carry trade money
[3347.799s] wasn&#39;t going into startups it was going
[3349.4s] into mag s and I think that&#39;s going to
[3352.64s] uh be in question and certainly I&#39;m not
[3356.0s] I&#39;m not calling for any type of
[3357.44s] Correction like a lot of people say well
[3359.0s] all the concentration it&#39;s got to be
[3360.64s] like the Tech record 2000 I don&#39;t think
[3363.119s] it&#39;s going to be that I I I just think
[3364.559s] they&#39;ve had they pulled forward a lot of
[3366.039s] gains they&#39;re making a huge amount of
[3367.839s] investment so what has helped the gains
[3370.88s] well one they&#39;ve been able to buy back
[3372.559s] unlimited amounts of stock so if if you
[3375.96s] make the pieces bigger earnings per
[3377.44s] share uh goes up but now they&#39;re taking
[3380.119s] that money and they are uh defensively
[3383.44s] spending in AI where they have not yet
[3387.599s] definitively produced any type of return
[3390.359s] there is hope that they will get a
[3392.4s] return on invested Capital you know
[3394.599s] several years out it remains to be seen
[3397.16s] but in the meantime they&#39;re tying up
[3399.079s] $300 billion do of capital that used to
[3401.2s] go towards BuyBacks which increased
[3403.28s] earnings per share is now going into uh
[3406.559s] data centers and the like uh hoping that
[3408.96s] they get a return in three years so
[3410.359s] earnings uh growth is decelerating
[3412.88s] margins are going to start to decelerate
[3414.96s] on those companies uh and um and then
[3418.559s] the the financing of that which was the
[3420.76s] carry trade uh in in large part is going
[3423.76s] away so is that where you want to be no
[3425.96s] and people have figured that out the
[3427.28s] market is smart It Go money goes where
[3428.88s] it&#39;s treated best and where is money
[3430.28s] gone it&#39;s gone to International it&#39;s
[3432.079s] gone to China Tech it&#39;s gone to uh a lot
[3436.079s] of places that were on not on most
[3438.4s] people&#39;s Bingo cards coming into the
[3440.079s] year uh and um you know places that uh
[3443.52s] we we have aggressively large positions
[3447.68s] let&#39;s turn it around what should be on
[3449.039s] our B Bingo cart for the rest of 2025
[3451.64s] here Tom like what what are you looking
[3453.0s] at you you touched on a few things like
[3454.44s] Emerging Markets you just I don&#39;t want
[3455.92s] to repeat what you just said here yeah
[3457.76s] but uh what what else should we be
[3459.2s] adding what are you looking for like
[3460.359s] deep values like I wrote down a name
[3462.039s] that you mentioned somewhere else was
[3463.599s] PayPal and uh sort of like Intel like
[3467.64s] the the the uh the vultures are circling
[3470.48s] I think around PayPal so I&#39;m curious
[3473.2s] that that&#39;s what&#39;s what I&#39;m picking up
[3474.359s] there&#39;s so much competition claron many
[3476.319s] other platforms venmo um and all those
[3479.4s] direct payment like platforms these days
[3481.839s] like why why is Paypal for example an
[3483.72s] interesting one and why should be an our
[3485.119s] bingo card yeah well the good news of uh
[3488.319s] of PayPal is that they own venmo so
[3490.44s] that&#39;s good venmo&#39;s a verb uh number two
[3493.799s] is uh you know we were pounding the
[3495.2s] table on that in the 60s it shot up to
[3497.28s] 90 it&#39;s now come off to 75 or
[3501.039s] 73 uh because the their guidance was uh
[3505.319s] lower than the market Market wanted but
[3506.88s] if you look back to last year Alex Chris
[3509.559s] did the exact same thing he sandbags he
[3512.52s] sets expectations low and then he
[3514.24s] destroys them on the upside and that&#39;s
[3516.44s] exactly what he&#39;s going to do this year
[3518.72s] uh on the basis of his sandbagger
[3520.559s] percentage I mean how much lower did he
[3523.119s] guide cash flow and earnings last year
[3525.359s] relative to what he performed we expect
[3527.599s] that they&#39;re not going to do seven
[3528.68s] billion of free cash flow this year
[3530.119s] they&#39;re going to do eight billion of
[3531.48s] free cash flow this year and they&#39;re
[3533.24s] going to use that to buy back stock so
[3535.559s] you know um they&#39;ve just authorized a $5
[3538.72s] billion buyback it&#39;s a 7075 billion
[3542.0s] market cap company they&#39;re going to buy
[3543.2s] in 20% of the stock so uh other than
[3546.68s] that how was the play Mrs Lincoln I mean
[3548.4s] you you&#39;ve got so much positive stuff
[3551.359s] happening they have their investor day
[3553.2s] today and they&#39;re explaining brain treat
[3555.64s] most people don&#39;t understand like when
[3557.68s] they take an Uber that is Paypal why
[3560.359s] because they own brain tree okay which
[3562.839s] does all the Uber processing when they
[3565.559s] uh order tickets for a concert uh
[3568.72s] through Ticket Master Etc so you know
[3571.28s] they&#39;re doing 500 billion dollars of
[3573.68s] Enterprise Bend that no one knows
[3575.119s] because it&#39;s not branded checkout their
[3577.2s] fast lane improves conversion for small
[3580.52s] business people like yourself from you
[3582.599s] know sub 50% to
[3584.76s] 80% uh they have and and uh the other
[3587.799s] reason that the market why why it&#39;s sold
[3589.799s] off after you know going up 50% quickly
[3593.88s] um is that he been firing unprofitable
[3599.039s] customers so customers that were at
[3601.319s] margins that the company actually loses
[3604.039s] money he said oh yeah I have a unique
[3606.52s] concept we&#39;re in business to make money
[3608.4s] so any clients that we&#39;re losing money
[3610.28s] on we&#39;re going to just fire and the the
[3613.119s] analysts the 24 year olds with their
[3614.76s] Excel spreadsheets say growth is
[3616.88s] decelerating meanwhile cash flow per
[3619.16s] share is going up earnings per share is
[3621.599s] going up margins uh um transaction
[3625.28s] margin is going up and it&#39;s just the
[3627.2s] beginning Alex Chris what ran 50% of
[3630.319s] into it the small business division uh
[3632.88s] the stock was like a double digit
[3635.079s] multibagger over his tenure and he ran
[3637.52s] 50% of revenues and he&#39;s going to do the
[3639.599s] exact same thing and he&#39;s going to keep
[3641.079s] under promising and overd delivering and
[3643.52s] somewhere around $120 $150 per share
[3647.079s] people are going to figure it out and
[3648.76s] you&#39;re gonna have people upgrading at
[3650.2s] the top and it&#39;ll run you know just like
[3652.079s] it overshot to the downside at $60 it&#39;s
[3654.92s] going to overshoot to the upside
[3656.52s] probably at 175 or 200 and when everyone
[3659.599s] gets excited and they&#39;re clamoring for
[3661.319s] it like some of the other shiny objects
[3662.92s] we&#39;ve seen recently come off the boil uh
[3665.359s] will help them out and we&#39;ll lay off our
[3667.039s] stock but until then it&#39;s trading at a
[3669.0s] dramatic discount to intrinsic value
[3671.44s] it&#39;s got an incredible Catalyst with
[3673.359s] Alex Chris running the ship and uh and
[3675.88s] we&#39;re very excited about PayPal to my
[3678.68s] defense venmo doesn&#39;t exist in Europe at
[3680.76s] least as far as I know so I do apologize
[3683.76s] for being ignorant that actually PayPal
[3685.24s] owns it I didn&#39;t know that most people
[3687.16s] don&#39;t actually actually you know
[3689.079s] probably half the people that are
[3690.2s] negative on the stock don&#39;t know that
[3691.76s] they own Beno so nothing to worry about
[3694.0s] there maybe they should hire a PR
[3696.2s] Company I don&#39;t know like uh it&#39;s an
[3698.28s] interesting thought because PR Tre
[3699.48s] another one as well like I don&#39;t think
[3700.76s] people always like what I&#39;ve been
[3701.88s] hearing about PayPal are fully aware
[3703.68s] what&#39;s going on all they see is like
[3705.52s] people using venmo and other platforms
[3707.64s] like there&#39;s other banking platforms
[3709.039s] like revolute and all those now these
[3710.68s] days that that they&#39;re competing with
[3712.839s] and there&#39;s like oh PayPal is dead right
[3715.16s] yeah but uh like my all my us friends
[3717.279s] give me doooo for like not using venmo
[3719.319s] and not being available on venmo to send
[3720.839s] me money when we go out or something I
[3722.839s] was like I don&#39;t have it yeah well you
[3725.359s] know look what we try to do as good
[3726.72s] investors is burden oursel with the
[3728.4s] facts so we read the public filings we
[3730.68s] listen to the conference calls we study
[3733.039s] the competition and and we don&#39;t enter
[3735.559s] an investment uh unless we have
[3737.839s] confidence if if uh we had to put in
[3740.88s] 100% of our net worth to own the company
[3744.039s] uh as equity and JP Morgan was going to
[3746.24s] finance the debt for us to take over the
[3748.24s] entire company would we do the deal and
[3751.2s] you know at a company trading at 30
[3754.279s] times sales and 44 times earnings I&#39;m
[3756.039s] probably not going to put up 100% of my
[3757.599s] net worth to own the company uh because
[3759.72s] if I&#39;m wrong uh JP Morgan gets the
[3761.52s] company and I get zero uh but a company
[3763.92s] like PayPal where it&#39;s generating you
[3765.68s] know eight seven eight billion dollars
[3767.079s] of free cash I&#39;d do that every single
[3768.92s] day of the week I&#39;d put a 100 so hey JP
[3771.279s] Morgan if you&#39;re listening uh you want
[3773.799s] to finance the debt I&#39;ll put up 100% of
[3775.88s] my net worth and have some meaningful
[3777.839s] equity in it let&#39;s do the deal
[3779.64s] absolutely no makes a lot of sense and
[3781.279s] you just really made the point of this
[3782.88s] channel as well educate yourself and
[3784.599s] you&#39;ll be ahead of everybody else
[3786.2s] absolutely that&#39;s right right um Tom
[3789.039s] last question and again this is not like
[3790.64s] Financial advice or anything like but
[3792.599s] I&#39;m going to ask you like the million
[3793.64s] dollar question is if I were if you were
[3795.52s] to invest a million dollars today how
[3797.72s] would you invest that
[3799.119s] money it&#39;s a good question I mean you
[3801.72s] know a couple months ago was easy I&#39;d
[3803.68s] put it all in Alibaba uh that&#39;s been
[3805.88s] home run that&#39;s our largest position and
[3808.039s] we&#39;re not Geniuses it took us we built
[3809.92s] it for two years when no one wanted it
[3811.72s] every time it dipped we were buyers you
[3813.92s] know and why why would we have that
[3815.72s] confidence when everyone else was saying
[3817.48s] it&#39;s uninvestable and uh Chinese
[3821.359s] Communist and all that stuff is because
[3823.48s] it&#39;s the same
[3824.64s] leader running the country when the
[3826.72s] stock was at $320 the only difference is
[3829.76s] uh I could buy it in 2024 at 2014 prices
[3834.52s] and the revenues are up 10 X the
[3836.279s] earnings per share are up five or 6X
[3839.119s] cash flow per share was up five or 6X so
[3841.0s] there&#39;s not a whole lot to think about
[3842.279s] there leader in AI leader in Cloud uh
[3845.119s] top retailer to the middle class and
[3847.24s] upper class as the economy recovers and
[3849.68s] the and the government flipped the
[3850.96s] switch a month a year and a half ago
[3853.039s] started doing stimulus and dribs and
[3854.799s] drabs and now it&#39;s building up the beach
[3856.76s] ball has been held underwater and now
[3858.24s] it&#39;s exploding upwards so any dips to
[3860.52s] buy in a company like Alibaba which is
[3862.44s] our largest position is interesting uh I
[3865.319s] would also be interested in basic uh
[3867.88s] simple companies like uh crown castle
[3870.44s] they own 40,000 cell towers it generates
[3873.52s] cash they just sold they&#39;re selling off
[3875.119s] their fiber business generating eight
[3876.92s] billion dollars of cash they&#39;re going to
[3878.72s] pay down debt it yields 7% while you
[3880.799s] wait that&#39;ll probably be up 50% over the
[3882.92s] next you know year and a half to two
[3885.079s] years uh boring companies like Baxter
[3887.839s] International they do uh medical devices
[3891.0s] IV Solutions infusion pumps Etc they
[3893.44s] just sold off uh their Kidney Care
[3895.799s] business to Carlile for 3.4 billion
[3898.079s] they&#39;re paying down debt they&#39;re going
[3900.279s] to have a new CEO announced soon and the
[3903.359s] reason that&#39;s so important is because
[3905.88s] the kidney care business was the slowest
[3907.92s] growth division in the company which
[3910.359s] meant it lowered earnings growth rate
[3912.92s] which lowered the multiple to low double
[3916.52s] digits and I think as people start to
[3918.48s] see in coming quarters what the business
[3920.24s] looks like and the growth rate looks
[3921.96s] like without the kidney business and
[3924.0s] with lower interest EXP
[3926.16s] more free cash flow uh that multiple is
[3929.16s] going to rate to 18 or 20 times even if
[3931.559s] the growth is you know mid single digits
[3935.0s] uh and that stock could be you know up
[3936.839s] from 35 to 60 or so again this is
[3939.76s] opinion not advice but these are the
[3941.52s] things we own and we share and we deal
[3943.92s] exclusively with family offices and
[3945.839s] ultra high net worth individuals so
[3947.44s] they&#39;re sophisticated investors and they
[3949.68s] they understand what we&#39;re doing uh but
[3952.68s] you know these are opportunities for
[3954.799s] newer investors s or uh people who
[3957.68s] aren&#39;t uh institutional investors to
[3959.92s] start to research to companies and see
[3961.72s] whether or not it makes sense and talk
[3963.16s] with their financial advisors uh and see
[3966.799s] whether uh buying more growth for Less
[3969.96s] dollars is a good strategy and we have
[3972.079s] found over many years that it&#39;s an
[3973.599s] incredible strategy have done right yeah
[3975.96s] no absolutely and you know there&#39;s so
[3977.799s] many single stocks that you could pick
[3979.359s] from it once you educate yourself on
[3981.119s] them you&#39;re way ahead of everybody else
[3983.119s] that&#39;s that&#39;s one of the reasons I like
[3984.319s] the mining game because that&#39;s where I
[3985.68s] feel I have a leg up on on others right
[3988.92s] and uh it&#39;s the exact same principle no
[3991.039s] Tom really appreciate the conversation

[4083.5s] [Music]
[4090.039s] you and we&#39;re back so that&#39;s the broad
[4093.52s] overview also want to thank fahed Saleem
[4097.48s] for including me in his article on yaf
[4099.56s] Yahoo finance about Alibaba you
[4102.08s] definitely want to read that one when
[4103.44s] you have a chance on hedge fund tips
[4106.48s] and as a theme for what we&#39;re going to
[4108.759s] be discussing today I want you to hear a
[4111.279s] couple quick minutes from Legend Peter
[4113.799s] Lynch here we go but you should study
[4116.4s] history and history is the important
[4118.359s] thing you learn from what you learn from
[4120.04s] history is the market goes down it goes
[4122.799s] down a lot the math is simple there&#39;s
[4125.319s] been 93 years of century this is easy to
[4127.92s] do the markets had 50 declines of 10% or
[4131.719s] more so 50 declines in 93 years about
[4135.52s] once every two years the market Falls
[4137.56s] 10% we call that a correction that means
[4140.44s] that&#39;s a euphemism for losing a lot of
[4141.839s] money rapidly but we you know we call it
[4144.44s] a correction and uh uh so 50 declines in
[4148.359s] 93 years about once every two years the
[4150.359s] market Falls 10% of those 50 declines 15
[4154.92s] have been 25% or more that&#39;s known as a
[4157.319s] bare market we&#39;ve had 15 declines in 93
[4161.04s] years so every six years the Market&#39;s
[4163.319s] going to have a 25% decline that&#39;s all
[4165.719s] you need to know you need to know the
[4167.64s] Market&#39;s going to go down sometime if
[4169.759s] you&#39;re not ready for that you shouldn&#39;t
[4171.6s] own stocks and it&#39;s good when it happens
[4174.4s] if you like a stock at 14 it goes to six
[4177.159s] that&#39;s great you understand the company
[4179.04s] you look at the balance sheet and
[4179.92s] they&#39;re doing fine you hoping to get to
[4181.799s] 22 with it 14 to 22 is terrific 6 to 22
[4185.6s] is exceptional so you take advantage of
[4188.08s] these declines they&#39;re going to happen
[4189.719s] no one knows when they&#39;re going to
[4190.88s] happen it would be very people tell you
[4193.04s] about it after the fact that they
[4193.92s] predicted it but they predicted it 53
[4195.76s] times and uh so you can take advantage
[4199.679s] of the volatility Market if you
[4201.28s] understand what you own uh so I think
[4203.64s] that&#39;s the key the element another key
[4205.719s] element is that you have plenty of time
[4209.0s] people are an unbelievable rush to buy a
[4211.88s] stock I&#39;ll give you an example of a
[4213.92s] well-known company Walmart went public
[4216.4s] in October of
[4218.239s] 1970 1970 went public already had a
[4221.48s] great record it had 15 years performance
[4224.88s] great Bal sheet you could have waited 10
[4228.199s] years saying you&#39;re a very conservative
[4229.56s] investor you&#39;re not sure this Walmart
[4231.12s] can make it you want to check you&#39;re you
[4233.48s] see them operate in small towns you&#39;re
[4234.84s] afraid they can only make it in seven or
[4236.28s] eight states you want to wait till they
[4237.239s] go to more States you keep waiting you
[4239.679s] can bought Walmart 10 years after they
[4241.4s] went public and made 35 times your
[4245.239s] money if you bought it when they went
[4247.08s] public you would have made 500 times
[4248.159s] your money but you going waited 10 years
[4249.88s] after wmart went public and made uh 30
[4252.92s] over 30 times your money
[4255.679s] and we&#39;re back and our quotes of the
[4257.64s] week some entrepreneurs think how can I
[4259.679s] make a lot of money but the better way
[4261.28s] is to think how can I make people&#39;s
[4264.12s] lives a lot better if you get it right
[4266.159s] the money will come that&#39;s from Richard
[4267.88s] Branson and I like to say if you help
[4269.56s] enough PE other people get what they
[4271.96s] want you will get what you want and for
[4275.12s] so many people they get it backwards uh
[4277.96s] and that&#39;s why they never get what they
[4279.48s] want opportunities come in frequently
[4281.64s] when it rains gold put out the bucket
[4284.0s] not the thimble that&#39;s from Buffett this
[4286.36s] week created some of those opportunities
[4289.04s] uh I&#39;m sure several of you that have
[4290.8s] been longtime listeners were were
[4293.0s] definitely plugging into that to take
[4295.64s] advantage and uh and then Jim ran time
[4300.239s] is more valuable than money you can get
[4301.96s] more money but you can&#39;t get more time
[4304.679s] and I know that&#39;s why so many of you
[4306.96s] Uber successful people in the world tune
[4309.6s] in hedge fund tips with Tom Hayes uh
[4312.76s] each
[4313.679s] week uh to to basically in one hour if
[4318.28s] you include the ask me anything
[4319.88s] questions two hours get what takes us
[4323.04s] you know 80 some odd manh hours to
[4325.88s] accumulate over the previous seven days
[4328.88s] from uh you know just a small percentage
[4331.08s] of the research that we do that goes

[4461.36s] come want to thank my buddy over at RBC
[4464.4s] for putting out the sler stuff uh you
[4467.32s] can see here Market taking a little bit
[4469.239s] of a breather uh I think we&#39;re getting
[4472.0s] close to that bounce and here&#39;s what
[4473.92s] he&#39;s looking at you know basically in
[4476.36s] the uh first year you get into that 10
[4481.48s] 11 12 weeks we should be getting a
[4483.44s] bounce here retest we&#39;re kind of in this
[4486.04s] Zone here before we get a monster rally
[4488.8s] going into effectively the summer before
[4493.0s] peeking out that&#39;s kind of the the model
[4495.719s] next year will&#39;ll be a little more Rocky
[4498.08s] depending on where you are in the market
[4500.4s] but uh I think we&#39;re going to make a lot
[4502.4s] of hay while the sunshines here and I&#39;m
[4504.199s] very very excited and and took advantage
[4506.639s] uh as we said this week with vanney and
[4508.96s] I think uh in coming weeks we&#39;re going
[4510.719s] to be a lot higher than we were on the
[4513.0s] day of that interview so you can see
[4515.08s] here on the daily kind of getting
[4517.08s] oversold here uh 10year yield completely
[4521.12s] rolled over we&#39;ll get a little bit of a
[4522.679s] bounce here I&#39;m sure oversold bounce
[4524.639s] just like I think we&#39;ll get an oversold
[4526.04s] bounce in mag 7 so you know uh um Nvidia
[4531.0s] down almost a third now since we
[4532.96s] published that article in June uh and
[4535.719s] we&#39;ll get a 10-point bounce and people
[4537.32s] will say oh this is great blah blah blah
[4540.239s] uh but you know for all the reasons
[4542.6s] we&#39;ve covered in previous podcasts I I
[4544.76s] think these things are going to be in a
[4545.8s] Range Consulting a lot a lot of gains
[4547.6s] for a long period of time and there&#39;s
[4549.96s] going to be a ton of money made
[4551.4s] Elsewhere on to the charts of the week
[4555.12s] so want to
[4557.8s] cover these this I thought was
[4560.32s] interesting the Commodities to equities
[4563.56s] ratio versus the US
[4566.76s] dollar um and you can see here the um
[4572.28s] different trade weighted index
[4575.4s] uh and how Commodities are at a bottom
[4578.679s] like we saw in when 20201 and prior to
[4582.4s] that in Reagan&#39;s second turn term before
[4585.76s] Commodities turned up and some of the
[4589.6s] overvalued pockets normalized this is
[4593.0s] the key to the market the 10-year bond
[4594.88s] yield that&#39;s the chart that you should
[4596.76s] be looking at every day not Donald
[4599.12s] Trump&#39;s tweets about this tariff or that
[4601.44s] tariff that&#39;s just a sideshow that&#39;s got
[4604.76s] everyone distracted from the real focus
[4607.719s] at uh heart here which is the carry
[4609.8s] trade unwind and uh if it if it relates
[4613.159s] to owning Tech uh are tariffs important
[4616.36s] yes but you have to keep in mind you
[4618.88s] know these are not 25% compounded at 10%
[4621.719s] a year this is a oneoff level up uh uh
[4626.32s] not compounded every year so it&#39;s just
[4629.28s] going to be a tax on the poor that&#39;s
[4631.159s] effectively what it is if it goes
[4632.92s] through and I would not make that bet uh
[4635.6s] I think what you&#39;re going to find is
[4636.719s] some compromise and somewhere in the
[4638.88s] middle and the market will be relieved
[4640.56s] and it will move forward just like it
[4642.52s] does that&#39;s why you see in this in the
[4646.239s] uh first year after the election that
[4650.08s] January through March early March period
[4652.88s] gets extremely volatile because the
[4655.28s] market likes certainty they don&#39;t care
[4657.239s] if the policy is good or bad they just
[4659.32s] care that they know what it is so they
[4661.639s] know what the rules of the game are and
[4663.199s] once Wall Street knows the rules of the
[4664.719s] game then they get on with making money
[4667.04s] because that&#39;s what Wall Street does
[4668.639s] this is a chart from the uh from Lou
[4671.639s] basanes via Charlie Bello
[4675.0s] and we&#39;ve covered this many times but
[4676.56s] it&#39;s critically important to understand
[4678.76s] because people are so stooped in recency
[4682.12s] bias uh from the zero interest rate
[4686.239s] policy period that favored uh mag 7 and
[4691.36s] stocks trading at 10 times sales and all
[4693.88s] the things that uh uh were were frothy
[4697.679s] and you can see going back you know 40
[4700.4s] 50 some odd years every every 10 years
[4703.36s] it just switches back and forward from
[4704.96s] us outperformance to International
[4706.76s] outperformance from us performance to
[4709.239s] International outperformance which you
[4710.679s] saw in the second term of Reagan us
[4713.239s] outperformance International
[4714.6s] outperformance Etc and this time will be
[4716.88s] no different we have started a period
[4719.4s] here uh in recent months of uh us out
[4722.719s] performance and if this was updated we&#39;d
[4724.56s] probably start to see the red with
[4727.28s] International dramatic
[4729.44s] outperformance um as a matter of fact
[4731.719s] the spread between mag 7 and the
[4735.0s] tremendous 10 top internet Giants is
[4739.32s] 42% of outperformance year to date with
[4743.239s] mag 7 down uh 7.7 and the tremendous 10
[4749.0s] up some
[4750.08s] 35% uh here&#39;s Matt Sur
[4753.199s] minaro uh oversold vix one month minus
[4756.28s] vix three months is usually where you
[4757.8s] get a bounce we agree we&#39;re going to
[4759.239s] show you a bunch of things that point to
[4760.639s] a bounce in coming weeks and I and I do
[4762.679s] think we&#39;re going to wind up higher a
[4764.8s] couple weeks out uh than we are now and
[4767.199s] a and maybe a lot
[4770.76s] higher this shows some of the stuffing
[4773.04s] taken out in the last few days uh last
[4777.4s] La you know year-to dat Amazon down
[4780.199s] probably at this point down 19 20% uh
[4783.36s] Microsoft probably 20% Google over 20%
[4786.28s] Nvidia closer to 30% maybe now uh
[4790.08s] Bitcoin probably 30% Palante tier I
[4792.719s] think was down another 10% today so
[4794.719s] probably
[4795.8s] 40% uh maybe
[4798.08s] 45% uh coinbase that&#39;s probably down 50%
[4801.239s] this was La at the end of last week that
[4802.84s] he put out these numbers Tesla&#39;s
[4804.12s] probably
[4805.08s] 50% Etc so
[4810.44s] um fcoin shockingly down 89% it may be
[4814.8s] down 95% now and uh that&#39;s how it goes
[4819.48s] here&#39;s again just to reminder when you
[4821.96s] guys feel bumps in the road the next
[4824.159s] couple of weeks uh just know that this
[4827.199s] is exactly the playbook for postelection
[4830.0s] cycle years uh and then get ready buckle
[4833.4s] up we&#39;re going straight up through the
[4835.6s] summer and and and no one&#39;s going to
[4837.8s] know what hit them and whether you look
[4839.32s] at this one or you look at Ned Davis
[4841.6s] research this is just a composite going
[4844.32s] all the way back uh in this
[4849.719s] case uh where does he start this data I
[4853.679s] know most of them are going going back
[4855.0s] to
[4856.92s] 1955 um here&#39;s uh home builders we want
[4860.239s] to be looking for buyers as rates come
[4863.6s] down the the big play that everyone&#39;s
[4865.48s] going to be surprised about is I think
[4867.48s] home builders will come back but I&#39;d
[4868.96s] rather play it through the leverage on
[4871.28s] The Leverage which is uh the Stanley
[4874.4s] Black and&amp; Deckers the generx of the
[4876.36s] world uh the suppliers that are going to
[4879.52s] be monsters as rates go down and uh same
[4883.88s] thing with the car I don&#39;t want the
[4885.12s] Builders of the homes I want the ones
[4886.56s] that Supply the Builders of the homes I
[4888.639s] don&#39;t want the automakers I want the
[4890.8s] suppliers of the automakers like Cooper
[4893.96s] standard and uh we&#39;re going to cover
[4896.36s] some really interesting things that
[4897.719s] President Trump said in his uh address
[4900.92s] this to Congress this week about car
[4904.12s] loans so we&#39;ll just keep that
[4905.88s] Cliffhanger going um and you can see
[4909.44s] Microsoft&#39;s evaluation tracking the
[4912.4s] 10year real Bond yield
[4915.88s] inversely uh this is just another way of
[4919.28s] saying that as yields go up the multiple
[4923.84s] on Microsoft y Japanese bond yields go
[4926.719s] up the yield the the multiple paid on
[4931.0s] Microsoft goes
[4934.239s] down and they&#39;re talking about tariffs
[4938.159s] to
[4939.12s] explain why us-based company tech
[4943.239s] companies are down which makes zero
[4946.719s] sense uh but that&#39;s why you tune in here
[4950.239s] to get the scoop and to set yourself up
[4953.199s] for Success dividend players jump to a
[4956.44s] 2.5 month High versus non-payers we love
[4960.239s] the dividend payers and all the type of
[4962.0s] stocks we&#39;ve talked about uh are are
[4965.0s] going to benefit from that and many in
[4967.32s] the whether it&#39;s Health Care with the
[4969.08s] backers whether it&#39;s the Stanley Black
[4972.0s] and Decker dividend Aristocrat type
[4974.159s] stock
[4975.08s] you want to have exposure margin debt
[4977.199s] Rises to 2021 levels well on the one
[4981.159s] hand that implies that you get a tech
[4983.12s] wreck like you had in 2022 we&#39;ve already
[4985.96s] kind of had it 20% maybe we&#39;ll have a
[4988.04s] little bit more uh in those overvalued
[4991.239s] Pockets but I do think they&#39;re getting
[4993.12s] close to a technical bounce area and I
[4996.44s] do think that they will trade in a range
[4998.199s] for some time bouncing around while
[5001.36s] other things outperform but what this
[5003.96s] doesn&#39;t account for is the fact that the
[5007.96s] value of the market is much higher than
[5009.92s] it was so the the margin debt as a
[5012.6s] percentage is still lower but I get the
[5016.12s] point they&#39;re trying to make it&#39;s just
[5017.719s] not scaled correctly southbound February
[5021.0s] buying the most since early
[5024.719s] 2021 uh so that was a a very positive
[5028.32s] period for Chinese
[5030.04s] stocks average price move in the so you
[5033.36s] can see here on average Mondays and
[5035.32s] Fridays have been the
[5037.159s] weakest uh
[5040.44s] since for for 2025 and then going all
[5043.32s] the way back to 1928 Mondays have always
[5045.199s] been the weakest uh with you know
[5047.719s] Fridays coming in a close second so my
[5051.4s] guess is we probably do turn around
[5054.0s] Tuesday however we do have the jobs
[5056.639s] report tomorrow that could be a catalyst
[5059.12s] if it comes in week from all the layoffs
[5061.28s] in
[5062.8s] Washington then
[5065.239s] uh maybe you could
[5070.04s] see expectations for a Fed cut coming in
[5074.76s] earlier than June and if it&#39;s really bad
[5078.96s] this month is on the table for the FED
[5083.96s] not
[5085.679s] probabilistic but from a nonp
[5088.8s] possibility to a possibility that&#39;s
[5091.52s] going to impact interest rates which is
[5093.6s] going to impact car loans which is going
[5094.92s] to impact mortgages which is going to
[5097.08s] impact the ability for the US to
[5099.639s] refinance boatloads of debt at lower
[5102.88s] rates uh some of this uh
[5107.84s] chaos may be less by accident and more
[5111.52s] by Design than originally thought so
[5116.159s] what are we keeping our eyes
[5118.32s] on
[5119.92s] Japanese government bond yields followed
[5123.92s] by
[5125.159s] European bond yields pay close attention
[5128.719s] because if those blow out number one
[5132.639s] you&#39;re going to have the ECB cutting
[5134.239s] okay so that&#39;s stimulative that already
[5137.159s] number
[5140.8s] two you
[5144.4s] have
[5146.679s] uncertainty like
[5148.8s] 2011 because they have high debt to GDP
[5151.56s] and they still uh
[5154.76s] the structurally set up in a very
[5156.96s] fragile way the way that they are unable
[5160.36s] to uh issue Bonds in the same way that
[5163.8s] the U us can um creates complications so
[5167.48s] we saw that in
[5168.679s] 2011 if fear about that shows
[5173.76s] up then there will be a further and
[5177.159s] stronger bid into us treasuries and
[5180.199s] that&#39;s potentially where we get the
[5181.96s] three handle on the 10year which again
[5185.56s] no one&#39;s bingo card except the
[5188.239s] incredible amazing listeners of hedge
[5192.28s] fun tips with Tom Hayes so uh you see
[5195.119s] this
[5197.32s] stuff lots of bears for stocks near new
[5200.119s] high okay this is Market
[5204.6s] concentration as it&#39;s ever been share of
[5207.4s] the top five companies by market cap in
[5209.119s] the S&amp;P 500 so look these are
[5211.92s] historically unsustainable and all that
[5214.239s] means is it&#39;s going to be a rotation out
[5217.119s] of what&#39;s concentrated and into what&#39;s
[5220.119s] unconcentrated and that doesn&#39;t
[5223.04s] necessarily uh imply a
[5227.199s] crash uh of the indices it can be a a
[5231.48s] rotation with those stalling out and
[5233.84s] others picking up as their earnings
[5235.84s] growth accelerates and as the
[5238.159s] concentrated numbers decelerate so theme
[5241.08s] over and over now playing out in real
[5243.04s] time um most of the world is is
[5245.44s] surprised and no one here is which is
[5248.76s] how we like it uh higher January and
[5251.199s] lower February is common now what a year
[5253.36s] later 12.3% okay that&#39;s from
[5256.4s] Carson initial jobless claims in
[5258.719s] Washington DC Skyrocket that&#39;s why this
[5260.96s] if this job Department if this jobs
[5263.04s] report comes in Weak it&#39;s going to be
[5265.0s] very constructive from a market
[5266.52s] standpoint because it brings the FED
[5268.199s] back into play much sooner than ever you
[5270.159s] know just a few weeks ago everyone
[5271.199s] saiding no Cuts because of the CPI
[5273.239s] report CPI is seasonally strong in
[5275.6s] January and February uh so that&#39;s a fake
[5278.719s] out and now we get to see what&#39;s under
[5280.6s] the surface and we also got to keep a
[5282.4s] strong eye on this GDP now at negative -
[5284.8s] 2.4% for q1 that&#39;s a big deal
[5288.639s] fortunately the GDP now has been wrong
[5291.4s] of late but you know two quarters is a
[5295.4s] is a recession and I think that that is
[5298.239s] low probability right now with 18%
[5300.44s] earnings growth and I think the numbers
[5302.32s] of uh uh at ATA fed are probably wrong
[5305.92s] again but you have to pay attention and
[5308.76s] keep keep your biases aside and deal
[5311.239s] with the facts and so far credit spreads
[5313.36s] are saying uh their numbers are probably
[5316.159s] wrong uh us initial jobless claims hit
[5319.04s] highest okay DC we got that bond yields
[5322.199s] going down we&#39;ve been expecting that
[5323.92s] that&#39;s happened uh cap backs we&#39;ve
[5326.56s] covered pening
[5328.56s] holds uh inflows into Europe everyone&#39;s
[5331.32s] chasing up so maybe we&#39;ll have some
[5333.679s] problems with the European bonds and
[5335.719s] that&#39;ll shake up their market and we&#39;ll
[5337.48s] see some flows we&#39;ll we&#39;ll we&#39;ll pay
[5339.159s] attention to that record outflow from
[5342.119s] crypto so a lot of um a lot of risk on
[5345.96s] stuff showing some some
[5347.719s] fear uh here&#39;s Seth golden with the a
[5351.44s] aii bull bear spread you can see uh when
[5354.32s] it gets this
[5356.8s] extreme um you know year out 6 months
[5360.88s] out on average you&#39;re up 133% 20 uh a
[5364.32s] year later you&#39;re up
[5366.88s] 22% this is international
[5370.32s] stocks second best month versus US
[5373.4s] stocks in the last 15
[5379.239s] years by the way 15 years every 10 to 15
[5382.96s] years it&#39;s it flips from us to
[5385.84s] International doesn&#39;t mean the
[5387.32s] international that us does bad it just
[5389.239s] means International does
[5392.4s] better what else we got here big
[5394.8s] rotation from mag 7 to China battic we
[5397.08s] talked about this tremendous 10 these
[5399.28s] are going straight up those are coming
[5400.84s] down they&#39;re going to meet in the middle
[5402.56s] and then China&#39;s going to exceed it just
[5404.48s] like China dramatically outperformed and
[5406.48s] then they caught caught up and one
[5408.639s] caught up and one caught down we&#39;re
[5410.44s] going to see mag 7 catch down and
[5412.48s] Chinese stocks catch up led by which Ali
[5416.44s] effen
[5418.28s] Baba bull markets last longer than you
[5420.679s] think we&#39;re only at 60 the average is 67
[5423.52s] months we are only at 28 months so we&#39;re
[5426.36s] halfway there uh Living on a Prayer and
[5430.4s] uh there we go uh Europe stocks breaking
[5432.6s] out this looks pretty healthy even if
[5434.0s] you get a pullback uh probably a deal
[5437.199s] with zalinski is what uh what&#39;s what set
[5441.08s] what sets that up number of unsold
[5443.36s] completed homes for sale eye on the
[5446.08s] housing markets you&#39;re seeing a lot of
[5447.56s] weakness in Florida houses inventory is
[5450.96s] super high prices being cut 10 20%
[5459.32s] that is often a precursor for other
[5462.199s] frothy areas around the
[5464.44s] country uh so we&#39;ll keep an eye out on
[5466.719s] that and I will have a front row seat in
[5469.239s] Orange County we shall see as the chin
[5472.8s] marginal CH uh Chinese dollar stops
[5475.76s] flowing in because fomo is happening in
[5478.08s] China with everything starting to go up
[5480.92s] um you know maybe we will see some some
[5483.36s] opportunities abound uh here as well big
[5487.44s] Tech big decline we got that um this is
[5493.44s] another analog for the first year of the
[5496.6s] presidential cycle again some weakness
[5499.08s] in late February through mid-march and
[5501.76s] then straight up into summer so there&#39;s
[5505.639s] the dollar Index just rolling
[5510.36s] over uh what else do we have here that
[5514.119s] the Atlanta fed GDP keeping an eye on
[5517.119s] that Euro Zone loans to households so
[5519.76s] credit expansion is starting to happen
[5521.48s] in Europe to businesses as well PMI
[5524.96s] manufacturing back in expansion in China
[5528.84s] mag 7 so again I think we&#39;re back down
[5532.159s] here probably get a technical bounce
[5535.08s] here so for those of you who really like
[5537.04s] those stocks probably get a little bit
[5538.92s] of bargain for us the margin of safety
[5541.8s] even at these discounted levels is not
[5543.6s] where we want to see it but they
[5545.4s] definitely will probably work as a trade
[5547.639s] for many of you that like to do that
[5550.0s] stuff it&#39;s not what we
[5552.239s] do
[5554.08s] uh let&#39;s see S&amp;P companies outperforming
[5558.159s] year on year uh this type of
[5561.88s] acceleration of
[5565.119s] breath uh is is
[5567.92s] um is very healthy and it&#39;s actually
[5570.4s] what we saw in when 2001 when small cap
[5574.199s] value and international dramatically
[5576.04s] outperformed even though there was some
[5577.719s] weakness short-term weakness in the
[5579.52s] economy and Tech got smashed um other
[5583.04s] periods where you saw this was the
[5585.36s] second term of trump where well again a
[5589.119s] second term of Reagan where again
[5591.239s] International outperformed domestic as
[5593.56s] we saw the chart earlier Friday&#39;s
[5596.88s] advancing volume second highest since uh
[5599.48s] covid 202&#39;s Market
[5601.48s] recovery interesting uh uh I don&#39;t know
[5605.4s] why okay uh here we
[5609.48s] go dollar rolling
[5616.28s] over oh this is
[5618.44s] interesting
[5621.0s] the EU Aerospace and defense index up
[5625.08s] dramatically relative to the mag7 index
[5628.679s] a lot of things are up relative it&#39;s
[5630.28s] it&#39;s not hard to beat 7.7% if you go to
[5633.44s] mag which is the mag 7 ETF it&#39;s down
[5636.52s] 7.7% maybe a little more by the
[5639.239s] close 10year yield down for seven
[5642.48s] straight weeks remember at 480 everyone
[5644.719s] was calling for five and I said three
[5646.4s] handle before five handle and uh we may
[5650.0s] not see a five handle before Trump is
[5652.0s] out of office so um that&#39;s that Goldman
[5656.6s] Sachs top down S&amp;P 500
[5659.639s] forecast we talk about guidance coming
[5662.52s] down home affordability is the lowest
[5665.6s] it&#39;s been since 20067 8 that doesn&#39;t
[5668.8s] mean we&#39;re going to have a housing
[5669.719s] crisis but I do think we are going to
[5671.159s] have some normalization of prices
[5673.6s] probably somewhat offset by lower
[5675.6s] mortgage rates creating demand so it&#39;ll
[5679.239s] be a wash and that affordability will go
[5681.639s] up as the cost of ownership goes down
[5683.36s] you know if you take a 10year from 480
[5686.28s] down to
[5687.52s] 350 and you get 30-year fix rates at 5.5
[5691.8s] the affordability from 7 two which it
[5694.28s] was a week ago not a week ago a month
[5696.8s] ago for a 30-year fix down to
[5699.6s] 55 uh you know that&#39;s huge that cuts 25
[5702.56s] 30% off the monthly payment and uh even
[5706.28s] if uh prices come down 10% I think
[5709.76s] you&#39;re going to see huge demand bids so
[5712.52s] not a housing crisis but an opportunity
[5715.56s] in the making except where there&#39;s super
[5717.719s] froth you know there&#39;s some areas where
[5719.84s] houses doubled after Co then doubled
[5721.76s] again uh those I could getting hit 30%
[5725.6s] may you
[5726.6s] know uh but we&#39;ll see chop frustration
[5729.719s] is normal we got that uh shortterm
[5732.48s] sentiment extremely pessimistic that&#39;s
[5734.4s] just another indicator pointing to a
[5736.08s] technical bounce here in coming days and
[5739.159s] weeks put volume second highest Spike of
[5742.56s] all
[5743.92s] time um you know so that tends to be a
[5747.52s] contrarian indicator large caps to small
[5750.32s] caps S&amp;P 500 uh divided by Russell 2000
[5753.88s] haven&#39;t seen it since 2001 I think you
[5756.28s] are going to see a ripy face off rally
[5758.239s] in small caps once we get through this
[5760.0s] tariff noise and going into the close I
[5762.36s] do think that Trump was saying that he
[5764.52s] likes the president of Mexico or
[5766.56s] something and uh he&#39;s going to back off
[5768.56s] on certain things I you know it&#39;s dayto
[5770.6s] day welcome to Trump 2.0 same as Trump
[5772.719s] 1.0 another day another headline another
[5775.44s] volatility and it resolves to the upside
[5777.92s] so uh just uh enjoy enjoy the show
[5780.92s] ladies and gentlemen growth of
[5786.199s] okay so that&#39;s that uh bull bear spread
[5788.4s] we
[5790.32s] covered crowded and cracking it was
[5793.48s] momentum and it&#39;s getting smashed I
[5795.36s] think uh paler was down another 10% or
[5798.119s] 8% today uh mag seven earnings reminder
[5803.48s] decelerating uh
[5805.28s] unmagnify accelerating that&#39;s why the
[5807.719s] opportunities are going to be in the UNM
[5808.92s] magnificent
[5810.28s] 493 and uh coming out of the mag even if
[5814.159s] you get this technical bounce so uh I
[5819.159s] it&#39;ll be interesting to see when they
[5820.639s] get this bounce in the next few weeks
[5822.04s] how many people chase up when they get
[5824.0s] near back near the top of the recent
[5826.159s] range and then they get smacked again
[5827.88s] but uh time will tell uh 50% of stocks
[5830.84s] outperforming the S&amp;P 500 up from just
[5832.88s] 30% last year this is what we saw last
[5835.88s] when 2001 what happened then regime
[5838.92s] change International outperformed value
[5841.36s] outperformed growth International
[5842.84s] outperformed domestic F value outperform
[5844.44s] growth small cap outperform large cap um
[5848.32s] I continue to repeat this because it
[5850.88s] continues to not be believed and even as
[5853.76s] it&#39;s happening right under everyone&#39;s
[5855.92s] noses in real time and they&#39;re
[5857.76s] distracted with Trump when they should
[5859.199s] be paying attention to Japanese bond
[5862.88s] yields uh active investors have moved
[5866.48s] closer to the Benchmark since uh 2023
[5870.52s] all closet index Huggers complete value
[5873.239s] list uh in that regard and uh smart
[5876.679s] people know and have figured that out
[5878.48s] and allocate to people that are
[5879.8s] uncorrelated with the
[5881.52s] indes uh or low correlation because
[5883.84s] they&#39;re actually doing real work uh
[5886.44s] 10-year treasury yield rolling over
[5888.719s] retail investors pile on Hong Kong
[5891.48s] listings through margin loans yeeha let
[5894.4s] it rip ladies and gentlemen Mainland
[5896.32s] buying Baba like it&#39;s going out of style
[5899.04s] uh as we had anticipated last summer and
[5902.159s] Brendan ahern&#39;s done a good job job of
[5904.08s] documenting that on his Twitter feed
[5906.36s] definitely check him out um us 10-year
[5910.76s] yield testing 2025 lows no one here is
[5914.239s] surprised everyone else seems to be
[5916.36s] European stocks rally to start
[5918.52s] 2025 uncertainty at an all-time high
[5921.0s] that&#39;s when you want to be a buyer not a
[5924.599s] seller and that&#39;s the GDP estimates gone
[5928.04s] down to
[5930.48s] 2.4%
[5932.0s] uh tarff
[5934.599s] okay Wards Automotive US Auto Sales SAR
[5938.599s] uh was sales were down 2% in February
[5941.92s] understandable with consumer confidence
[5943.199s] through the floor with the fears around
[5945.119s] tariffs creating inflation blah blah
[5947.08s] blah again it&#39;s not whether the outcome
[5949.48s] is good or bad it&#39;s whether Wall Street
[5951.28s] knows the rules and once we have
[5952.52s] certainty in policy Market&#39;s going to go
[5954.48s] straight up on that type of 18.2%
[5957.119s] earnings growth uh guidance was weak
[5960.48s] it&#39;s expected to be weak the first two
[5962.119s] weeks every two two months every year
[5964.199s] but not as bad as I thought the
[5965.719s] estimates are still holding in at 271
[5968.199s] down from Peak 275 which is really not a
[5971.199s] big downgrade and
[5973.719s] 2025 six rather has gone up so as always
[5978.28s] backend loaded set expectations low
[5980.88s] exceed them everyone&#39;s happy until late
[5983.56s] summer when we get some seasonal
[5985.679s] weakness again but in the mean time the
[5987.84s] party will be on again on no one&#39;s Bingo
[5990.96s] cards right now but wait and see and
[5993.88s] that&#39;s what you will see so crypto flows
[5996.32s] you know the one thing that the crypto
[5998.92s] community may have overlooked is be
[6002.48s] careful what you wish for um you know
[6004.84s] that the thesis behind Bitcoin in
[6007.4s] particular because uh some of the others
[6010.04s] have great like great utility I&#39;ve had
[6012.76s] great conversations with experts in
[6014.4s] ethereum I think that&#39;s going to be
[6016.239s] something to pay attention to as a real
[6019.599s] platform but uh it&#39;s not what I do so
[6021.88s] I&#39;m not even going to comment on it and
[6023.48s] I&#39;m not even it&#39;s just it&#39;s like I&#39;m a
[6026.4s] golfer I I don&#39;t watch basketball that
[6028.679s] much so like I can enjoy basketball but
[6031.599s] I I have zero value at around basketball
[6033.56s] so I I have I&#39;m completely agnostic
[6035.52s] about this but as it relates to bitcoin
[6037.76s] because I see sailor a lot on TV and
[6039.599s] everything uh and leveraging up like
[6042.04s] it&#39;s going out of style and borrowing
[6043.84s] money to buy more Bitcoin and all that
[6045.48s] stuff and maybe it&#39;ll end well and so
[6047.48s] far it&#39;s going well and everyone thinks
[6048.92s] he&#39;s a genius um but what they don&#39;t
[6052.04s] count on if they get what they want
[6054.159s] which is a crypto-friendly uh
[6057.4s] Administration putting regulation in um
[6060.679s] being pro crypto is that the very thing
[6064.84s] that put them in the position that they
[6067.119s] are is the perceived scarcity around
[6070.599s] Bitcoin and what they may not be
[6073.0s] accounting for is the amount of assets
[6076.159s] allocated to
[6078.48s] crypto um that only have you know three
[6083.04s] or for legitimate places to go whether
[6086.599s] Bitcoin
[6088.239s] ethereum a couple others maybe um when
[6092.28s] the administration does what they want
[6093.96s] them to do um hundreds if not thousands
[6098.48s] of new
[6100.52s] crypto issuers are going to come to bear
[6103.48s] and compete for that fixed bucket of
[6107.599s] crypto assets and you could say well the
[6109.679s] bucket will grow maybe it&#39;ll grow a bit
[6111.76s] that that that that&#39;s certainly possible
[6113.239s] possible that wouldn&#39;t surprise me at
[6114.92s] all but you are going to have thousands
[6117.76s] of new issuers getting into the gold
[6119.599s] rush and while everyone thought the
[6121.96s] particular coin or token was scarce what
[6125.96s] they didn&#39;t count on is an is an
[6128.48s] unlimited supply of coins and tokens
[6131.88s] that may be quote unquote scarce but the
[6133.96s] overall bucket becomes unlimited and it
[6135.88s] dilutes the hell out of each individual
[6137.96s] one and only the ones that actually have
[6140.52s] utility in terms of transaction owners
[6143.639s] ship um uh Etc which is you know one or
[6149.199s] two um we get washed away so that&#39;s
[6153.4s] where it is uh I have nothing really
[6155.679s] valuable to say maybe well we we won&#39;t
[6158.639s] but um so something to keep in mind uh
[6162.679s] Brent down I keep looking for more
[6165.56s] opportunities and energy and I keep
[6166.96s] pointing right back to com stock
[6168.52s] resources which we have a big position
[6170.96s] side by side with Jerry Jones
[6173.8s] uh none of the other stuff is coming out
[6175.599s] here&#39;s where we are in terms of tariffs
[6177.92s] again we&#39;ve covered this on TV uh if he
[6180.76s] does a 100% of everything we&#39;re still
[6182.719s] nowhere near where we were uh at the we
[6186.44s] we would be still below where we were in
[6188.4s] the mid-20s remember they raised tariffs
[6191.239s] for some 12 straight years of economic
[6195.36s] Prosperity before you got to smooth
[6197.96s] Holly
[6200.04s] um so that&#39;s that&#39;s where we are that&#39;s
[6202.599s] where we make maybe if if everything
[6204.4s] happens but already he&#39;s walking back
[6206.28s] Mexico so that takes it back down uh we
[6208.96s] are at record low historic tariffs so
[6210.84s] just keep that in
[6212.239s] mind uh natural gas going straight
[6214.44s] through the roof we like
[6221.4s] that okay Logistics
[6224.599s] managers this is interesting the
[6226.48s] logistics managers Index this relates to
[6229.44s] gxo Rose for a second consecutive month
[6231.84s] to 62.8 making the strongest growth in
[6234.36s] logistics sector since June
[6236.44s] 2022 again dstock cycle to restock cycle
[6239.92s] which we&#39;ve covered many many times on
[6241.56s] this podcast sharp increase in inventory
[6243.719s] levels this led to higher inventory
[6245.28s] costs in warehousing prices while
[6247.0s] warehousing capacity decreased because
[6249.44s] they had a glut of warehousing capacity
[6251.119s] remember they built out too much because
[6253.159s] everything that happened at Co Peak now
[6255.0s] it&#39;s being absorbed
[6257.52s] um and and so on and so forth so that
[6259.8s] should bode well for gxo in coming
[6262.44s] quarters once the CMA stuff is pretty
[6264.639s] much resolved and the new CEO is
[6267.32s] announced which will be a rock star if
[6270.119s] passes any prologue as it relates to the
[6273.48s] type of people that uh Brad Jacobs
[6276.56s] attracts
[6278.199s] share of clients expecting the US to be
[6281.32s] the best performing Global Equity region
[6283.719s] at the Goldman Sachs Global strategy
[6285.52s] conference in January the highest
[6288.48s] percentage of managers expected us to be
[6290.639s] the best this year and they were all
[6293.08s] wrong it&#39;s not even a competition S&amp;P up
[6297.599s] uh excuse me S&amp;P down close to 1% year
[6301.0s] to date Europe up up
[6304.44s] 15% uh kweb up
[6307.159s] 25% Bob up
[6309.84s] 65% uh you know there you
[6312.76s] go that&#39;s that chances of a cut we
[6316.04s] covered us trade policy uncertainty
[6318.96s] index I mean this is where opportunities
[6322.52s] are made everything that got hit by
[6324.36s] tariffs I think is going to be the buy
[6326.28s] opportunity of a Sentry in coming weeks
[6329.199s] um and we&#39;ll just wait and see
[6331.48s] percentage of companies expected to
[6332.719s] outpace the mag seven up from just 8% at
[6335.199s] the lows of second half 2023 going
[6337.639s] straight
[6338.96s] up and so on and these are also
[6343.32s] coincidentally
[6347.48s] um yeah the times you want that that you
[6350.199s] start to see massive broadening Alibaba
[6352.639s] Shar held via southbound stock connect
[6355.52s] absolutely ramping up every single
[6357.239s] Mainland Chinese person is buying
[6359.32s] Alibaba stock like it&#39;s going out of
[6361.04s] style billions more billions in billions
[6364.04s] more to come and the international
[6366.199s] people will slowly but surely start to
[6368.719s] be forced in not because they want to
[6370.88s] invest in China but because they want to
[6372.719s] keep their jobs and the problem is is
[6375.04s] they&#39;re so underweight China and they&#39;re
[6376.599s] so underweight International and they&#39;re
[6378.76s] dramatically underperforming and they
[6381.44s] now have job risk so all of the sudden
[6383.88s] their ideology about G and communism and
[6386.76s] all the excuses uh go out the
[6389.639s] window just like you saw with all the
[6391.119s] woke is broke once they start going up
[6393.52s] everyone chases them and this time will
[6396.159s] be no different mortgage rates coming
[6399.56s] down they&#39;re going to go a lot lower
[6402.04s] China sets official deficit at decades
[6404.719s] high level they&#39;re going to stimulate
[6406.96s] till the cows come home deficit spending
[6409.48s] like it&#39;s going out of style 4% of GDP
[6413.56s] that is a big deal massive spending
[6418.04s] program focused on
[6422.639s] consumption there&#39;s natural gas going
[6424.96s] through the
[6432.88s] roof this
[6435.119s] was don&#39;t have that
[6438.8s] date infrastructure
[6444.52s] daily trading sentiment has fallen to
[6446.84s] extreme pessimism from Ryan Dietrich uh
[6449.599s] ndr research rather uh this is where you
[6452.4s] get these technical bounces so pay
[6454.239s] attention that&#39;s bespoke same
[6458.599s] thing a lot of different indicators
[6460.76s] pointing to the same thing that&#39;s the
[6466.0s] Fed so last year&#39;s we said the last will
[6469.8s] be first that&#39;s been the case
[6471.52s] international Healthcare Etc the first
[6474.08s] shall be last paler Nvidia they&#39;re
[6476.04s] probably the uh so they were the best
[6478.119s] last year uh in the last two weeks paler
[6480.84s] is down
[6481.639s] 32% Nvidia is down 16% this is probably
[6486.76s] uh as of March 4th and that&#39;s just the
[6488.639s] last two weeks year-to date it&#39;s double
[6490.239s] that probably on both of those um what
[6493.239s] else is getting smashed
[6495.679s] broadcom uh Arista networks Marvel
[6499.88s] Netflix um Tesla
[6504.88s] and so
[6507.719s] on Alibaba stock Rose More than 70%
[6510.76s] since the January low Euro rebounds to
[6513.8s] four-month high against the US dollar is
[6517.159s] weakening euro is strengthening dollar
[6520.0s] is rolling
[6523.56s] over similar to Trump 1.0 we covered
[6527.599s] that look at this move in the euro
[6532.96s] China switches priority to consumption
[6535.239s] in work report from highquality
[6537.239s] development they did a complete 180
[6540.0s] degree turnaround from last year and
[6542.92s] look what&#39;s
[6544.4s] happening
[6548.679s] um semiconductor
[6552.88s] cycle that&#39;s the semiconductor cycle we
[6555.679s] covered last
[6561.159s] week small cap out
[6569.88s] performer this is interesting this is
[6572.84s] that last time we saw these levels were
[6574.96s] early 2000s and then again in 2009 and
[6578.199s] then we had an A Monster outperformance
[6580.88s] in small caps following those periods so
[6582.8s] it&#39;s definitely worth paying attention
[6584.28s] to there&#39;s the kweb just getting started
[6587.56s] cranking uh kudos to Brenan we were in
[6590.0s] the Foxhole together I remember when we
[6592.08s] played golf together uh someone and I I
[6595.599s] put a picture on Twitter I think it was
[6597.88s] in the late summer or early fall or
[6600.04s] something like that and uh it was near
[6602.96s] the lows and someone said uh Tom and
[6605.92s] brandan getting together is going to
[6607.239s] Mark the bottom in China and they were
[6610.04s] right it basically went straight up ever
[6611.639s] since then so uh so that&#39;s that
[6619.04s] um here&#39;s another put volume this this
[6622.0s] is a wash out all these people that
[6623.76s] record Put volume on the day I was on
[6626.159s] with vanney those people are going to
[6627.599s] get flushed the sellers of the puts are
[6630.159s] going going to be the ones that made all
[6631.28s] the money the buyers are going to get
[6633.199s] smoked
[6636.159s] um you you know just for future
[6638.32s] reference ladies and gentlemen you want
[6640.239s] to buy insurance on your house before
[6643.4s] you have a fire it&#39;s amazing how many
[6645.48s] people buy puts in the hole when the not
[6648.079s] only is the price near the bottom but
[6649.88s] the implied volatility is at record
[6653.199s] highs and people are buying puts in the
[6654.84s] hole as if that&#39;s going to protect them
[6657.159s] uh it&#39;s too late you know you can&#39;t call
[6661.56s] Chub after after the house is half
[6663.52s] burning down it&#39;s just one the premiums
[6665.84s] would be too high and two they don&#39;t
[6667.32s] protect much because you only get half a
[6668.88s] house so uh leave it at that want to put
[6672.159s] this guy on uh he had some interesting
[6675.04s] things to say about uh daily domestic
[6678.159s] consumption U David final question for
[6680.52s] you we&#39;ve we&#39;ve yet to talk about
[6682.639s] tariffs in this specific conversation
[6685.0s] and the re the reason I frame it that
[6687.04s] way is I&#39;m curious to what extent
[6690.56s] tariffs or the external challenges will
[6692.52s] be referenced these next few days well I
[6696.199s] let me be fair Frank okay I I strongly
[6698.679s] believe this time around tariff is no
[6701.32s] longer a big issue I would even if you
[6704.04s] give me a order of three top issues in
[6706.36s] China or challenges in China I don&#39;t
[6708.599s] even put top three even among the top
[6711.04s] three the Tariff from president Trump in
[6714.04s] fact the whole economy Was preparing for
[6716.56s] 40% even 60% of tariff hike from
[6720.0s] president Trump now he&#39;s only imposing
[6722.199s] 10% of course they indirect tariff upon
[6725.04s] Chinese uh products from Mexico from
[6727.52s] Canada from Europe but overall it&#39;s
[6729.679s] still smaller than people anticipated
[6732.0s] it&#39;s smaller than uh the year of
[6734.44s] 2018 so this time around we the Chinese
[6738.04s] economy is fully fully prepared I do not
[6740.76s] think the the Tariff is big issue the
[6743.079s] really to deal with tariff is the same
[6745.679s] as deal with other issues in Chinese
[6747.719s] economy that is to boost domestic
[6749.8s] consumption and on this issue there&#39;s
[6751.84s] already tremendous tremendous
[6753.599s] discussions and also a lot of policies
[6756.079s] will be implemented down the road and
[6759.88s] we&#39;re back uh Alibaba stock is rising
[6763.159s] why is Bucking the tech selloff uh
[6766.0s] obviously this is not this is the more
[6768.32s] optimistic writer and he&#39;s done a good
[6770.44s] job over at Baron Adam
[6774.32s] Clark
[6776.44s] um the other thing oh by the way
[6779.84s] downloads of
[6782.119s] alibaba&#39;s
[6786.4s] AI not not okay better than deep seek
[6789.04s] and open AI Alibaba touts open source AI
[6792.48s] model that beats Rivals it&#39;s also the
[6794.719s] most downloaded it just overtook deep
[6797.04s] seek in downloads uh JD sales rise the
[6800.719s] most in years after China consumers
[6803.119s] awaken just the beginning and Baba&#39;s
[6805.48s] going to get way more than JD is going
[6807.639s] to do but that&#39;s just symptomatic of the
[6809.32s] whole group they&#39;re all going to do well
[6810.8s] except maybe Teemu will do less well uh
[6813.639s] and pindu Duo China steps up support for
[6816.239s] Tech sector as AI enthusiasm sores

[6846.28s] curbs
[6847.88s] shocker uh with Trump&#39;s tariffs paused
[6851.36s] big three automakers May race to build
[6855.56s] inventories so we may wind up with an
[6858.32s] enormous frontload for Cooper standard
[6862.639s] in perfect timing for them to have a
[6867.159s] blowout first and second quarter while
[6870.92s] rates are coming down to refinance the
[6873.719s] whole damn thing at low rates at the
[6876.719s] perfect time with amazing free cash flow
[6879.079s] which is going to add more cash flow as
[6880.76s] they bring that interest expense down
[6883.239s] and volumes go up so this may be an
[6885.36s] unintended consequence that no one is
[6888.0s] positioned for thinking tariffs are
[6889.719s] going to crush Advanced Auto Parts and
[6892.44s] Crush Cooper standard and and what&#39;s
[6895.079s] going to happen in reality is it&#39;s going
[6896.96s] to pull forward so much in the race and
[6899.52s] the open window as it gets delayed to
[6902.0s] produce as many cars as humanly possible
[6905.44s] uh and they may pull forward a Year&#39;s
[6906.96s] worth of production if uh if there&#39;s any
[6909.119s] Merit to this article which I do think
[6910.8s] that that there is uh dollar ding by
[6913.119s] Trump tariffs Disney stock Rises more

[6923.28s] interest rates dropped to the lowest
[6925.04s] since last year Trump says he wants in
[6928.639s] this is the most important headline of
[6930.599s] the week Trump says he wants interest on
[6933.52s] car loans tax deductible if us made if
[6937.04s] this goes through our estimates on what
[6939.56s] Cooper standard can do are probably 30
[6943.159s] to 50% too conservative Advanced Auto
[6947.239s] Parts revamps Supply Chain in effort to
[6949.48s] reverse sales slump we included an
[6951.8s] interview with Shane o Kelly in this
[6953.92s] week&#39;s article of the week um that Jeff
[6957.76s] found and uh it&#39;s phenomenal and uh
[6962.4s] everything he said he was going to do he
[6964.04s] is doing and people are uh in the short
[6967.679s] term uh voting machine based on emotions
[6970.36s] long-term weighing machine based on
[6972.239s] fundamentals uh I&#39;m excited about this
[6974.32s] one so we&#39;ll leave it at that here is an
[6977.239s] awesome headline as well exclusive
[6980.239s] Nvidia and broadcom testing on Intel
[6983.48s] manufacturing process sources say
[6986.199s] they&#39;re not doing this out of the
[6988.119s] kindness to strangers they are doing
[6990.079s] this in their own self-interest the
[6992.96s] reason we got bearish on Nvidia in June
[6995.599s] and wrote the article on June 20th
[6998.04s] intitled the next pain trade which you
[7000.52s] can find at hedge fund
[7002.84s] tips.com uh and while you&#39;re there you
[7005.4s] should go to uh terms this is opinion
[7009.199s] not advice talk to your financial
[7011.44s] advisor uh don&#39;t do anything uh be
[7014.96s] conservative don&#39;t listen to anything I
[7016.76s] say uh terms and conditions there
[7024.119s] um they the the reason it&#39;s not because
[7028.52s] AI is not going to happen and it&#39;s not
[7030.48s] because Nvidia is a Bad Company both of
[7033.239s] those things are are not true a AI is
[7036.32s] everything that you think great is going
[7038.36s] to happen in AI is going to happen it&#39;ll
[7039.92s] probably take a little longer than you
[7041.079s] think but it will happen most likely
[7043.76s] number
[7044.599s] two uh the problem with their
[7047.92s] decelerating growth rate it&#39;s
[7050.56s] not declining demand they have more
[7054.239s] demand than they can produce it&#39;s they
[7056.76s] are not the captain of their own ship
[7058.92s] they rely on the kindness of
[7060.92s] strangers and Taiwan semiconductors is
[7064.079s] only giving them $4 billion per quarter
[7067.8s] and that&#39;s their limitation as the base
[7070.0s] goes larger and they&#39;re still only
[7072.199s] growing at 4 billion the growth rate is
[7075.4s] decelerating uh not because they don&#39;t
[7077.32s] have demand because they don&#39;t have
[7078.719s] capacity they rely on Taiwan
[7080.56s] semiconductor if Taiwan semiconductor
[7082.0s] blew up tomorrow Nvidia would be out of
[7083.599s] business okay that&#39;s not going to happen
[7086.119s] but they need intel to be doing it and
[7090.04s] the good news is Intel is going to do it
[7092.119s] and it&#39;s going to be a money machine and
[7093.92s] no one is prepared for that except for
[7096.199s] the folks listening here I loved this
[7098.599s] article from Craig Bartlett who was the
[7100.52s] former CEO and chair of Intel
[7102.719s] he says Intel is back stop talking about
[7104.96s] breaking it up what he&#39;s saying was they
[7107.84s] should fire the board and rehire Ginger
[7110.679s] and I actually agree with that it&#39;s not
[7112.36s] going to happen but they fired Ginger at
[7116.52s] the five yard line you know it takes
[7118.8s] years to build a Fab okay and the idea
[7122.079s] of Taiwan semiconductor investing a 100
[7123.96s] billion or whatever they&#39;re going to do
[7125.0s] to build Fabs good luck we&#39;ll see you in
[7126.88s] 5 to 10 years Intel is there that&#39;s why
[7131.56s] Nvidia and broadcom are already testing
[7134.48s] the production in their 18a facility
[7137.079s] which is showing really good results and
[7138.8s] will probably be live before the end of
[7140.679s] the year and hockey stick and no one&#39;s
[7142.92s] expecting and that&#39;s going to be where
[7144.96s] the excess capacity when Intel recovers
[7148.48s] uh Nvidia will catch a bid because there
[7150.239s] will be capacity for them uh to to to
[7155.079s] expand beyond that $4 billion a quarter
[7157.52s] which is decelerating growth rate so um
[7160.599s] I think this board
[7164.04s] made a huge
[7165.28s] mistake uh I think they will announce a
[7167.48s] good CEO I think The Foundry is going to
[7169.599s] work and um and I think they should all
[7172.96s] be fired even if they don&#39;t bring Ginger
[7176.119s] back stop the Northface windbreaker all
[7179.079s] of our favorite celebrities are Co how
[7181.119s] how to shop the Northface windbreaker
[7183.0s] that all of our favorite celebrities are
[7184.639s] coveting uh so that&#39;s that in El
[7187.44s] magazine that is
[7189.8s] uh the hell is her name uh
[7196.0s] um I don&#39;t know but she&#39;s pretty
[7198.679s] popular anyway so more great stuff from
[7201.56s] Brack and Daryl Besson says housing will
[7203.4s] unfreeze in weeks seize 2%
[7207.36s] inflation I don&#39;t know about the 2%
[7209.44s] inflation but I do agree with what
[7211.96s] they&#39;re doing to the 10-year Texas needs
[7214.52s] the equivalent of 30 reactors to meet
[7216.32s] data center power
[7218.56s] demand AI fever in power stocks moves
[7221.52s] from new nulear to plain natural gas
[7225.079s] just beginning uh investors see 2017
[7228.199s] like rally in the making for emerging
[7231.04s] market currencies all the things we were
[7233.239s] pointing to that are now playing out
[7235.28s] humanoid robots finally get jobs uh
[7238.239s] where well they get it at gxo Logistics
[7241.04s] baby uh that&#39;s that uh betting on the
[7245.079s] jockey stock market and sentiment
[7246.56s] results this article goes into PayPal
[7249.599s] investor day with Alex Chris and uh
[7253.92s] Shane o Kelly with Advanced Auto Parts
[7257.0s] we are running long on time so we&#39;ve got
[7260.0s] to get through this and basically what
[7262.96s] we cover here is the turnaround plan
[7266.44s] they look at the end of they they&#39;re
[7268.119s] sitting on a billion one eight 1.8
[7269.84s] billion of of cash they pay down their
[7272.48s] debt they&#39;re closing the stores that
[7274.36s] they needed to close they&#39;re
[7275.44s] consolidating the the supply chains uh
[7278.199s] listen to this interview we&#39;re not going
[7279.88s] to play this interview with with uh
[7282.8s] Shane o Kelly on the podcast because we
[7286.4s] simply don&#39;t have enough time but if you
[7288.0s] own one share of this stock you should
[7289.88s] listen to this interview I mean at the
[7292.239s] end of the day nothing has changed from
[7294.32s] my original thesis which is very simple
[7296.119s] 7% operating margin which they&#39;re still
[7298.639s] affirming couple years out last time
[7301.639s] that implies 600 million of operating
[7304.0s] income 630 million dollar of operating
[7307.0s] income and the last time they had that
[7308.88s] was 2019 2022
[7312.76s] um there were four times that it hit
[7315.44s] that level of operating income and in
[7317.719s] those years the stock traded between
[7319.599s] $186 and $244 and here we have it at $35
[7323.88s] you can&#39;t give it away uh with the
[7325.639s] balance sheet healthy with a competent
[7327.88s] management executing on the plan and uh
[7331.04s] so you know no no big deal uh it&#39;s
[7333.679s] raining gold we&#39;re pulling out the
[7335.079s] buckets you do whatever you think makes
[7336.96s] sense uh so go through this with fine
[7339.4s] tooth comb if you own even one share of
[7342.36s] that and then PayPal opportunity of a
[7344.52s] lifetime here uh to take advantage and
[7347.56s] there was an interview with a guy named
[7350.56s] Crossroads and he&#39;s basically like he&#39;s
[7353.0s] just like a college student or PhD
[7355.119s] student he doesn&#39;t manage any money but
[7357.159s] he likes stocks and he uh got an
[7359.88s] interview with Alex Chris and it was a
[7362.239s] phenomenal interview the full 30 minutes
[7365.44s] you should listen to the full 30 minutes
[7367.159s] this is huge uh and we can&#39;t talk too
[7370.199s] much about the stock price and price AC
[7371.88s] action but it seems to me as an investor
[7374.159s] that there&#39;s a disconnect between what
[7376.04s] the market is seeing for PayPal and it&#39;s
[7378.0s] reflected in the price action versus the
[7380.239s] direction that you guys are clearly
[7381.44s] heading and so what do you think is the
[7382.8s] biggest factor that the market may be
[7384.84s] overlooking in PayPal right
[7387.199s] now
[7388.29s] [Music]
[7390.679s] um I have no idea you know I I came here
[7394.44s] I think the the stock was um
[7396.88s] significantly undervalued we&#39;re up 20%
[7400.0s] year-over-year and I think we&#39;re still
[7401.8s] dramatically
[7402.92s] undervalued um we we
[7406.32s] inflected uh a business that had been
[7409.079s] losing uh money for two years in a row
[7412.32s] and delivered you know if I&#39;d come to
[7413.88s] you a year ago and said you know how
[7415.84s] would you feel about 5% transaction
[7417.76s] margin 6% transaction margin in 24 I
[7420.84s] think pretty much everyone would have
[7422.199s] been like yeah there&#39;s no possible way
[7424.84s] you can do that and we delivered it um
[7427.88s] and then we put uh together you know
[7430.28s] again we&#39;re being prudent I I had a lot
[7432.159s] of conversations with investors when I
[7433.8s] got here and um a lot of the feedback
[7436.119s] was hey in the past the company had been
[7438.4s] really bullish on projections and then
[7440.599s] missed and that&#39;s just not my style
[7443.04s] that&#39;s not the mentality that we have
[7444.719s] and so we&#39;re going to tell you when we
[7446.96s] when we say something we&#39;ve got line of
[7448.639s] sight to it and we&#39;re going to go
[7449.599s] execute against it my guess
[7452.679s] is um there&#39;s been a lot of suffering in
[7456.119s] this stock in the last few years you
[7458.079s] just have to look at the chart and and
[7460.0s] understand that you know there was a
[7461.8s] Peak and then it fell and so we&#39;ve got a
[7465.4s] lot of investors both retail and and
[7468.0s] institutional that have lived through
[7470.239s] that and I think with a brand new
[7472.36s] leadership team coming in um we&#39;re in a
[7475.159s] bit of a waitand see mode and the best
[7478.44s] thing we can do is deliver for
[7480.88s] customers execute our plan provide you
[7483.719s] as much transparency as possible as to
[7485.719s] what we&#39;re doing and have a very high
[7488.36s] say do ratio um we beat every quarter
[7491.119s] that we told we were what we were going
[7493.079s] to do um abely I know everyone wants us
[7495.52s] to beat by even more and like all of
[7497.159s] that happens we also have to recognize
[7499.52s] that the Innovations we&#39;re putting out
[7501.76s] um take time right I this is just I&#39;ve
[7504.04s] worked in different businesses this just
[7505.599s] happens to be one where you know we are
[7507.76s] at a scale where when we put a merchant
[7510.0s] Innovation out like these new
[7511.159s] Innovations we have for for Branded
[7513.36s] checkout they are crushing it when you
[7516.52s] look at the conversion rate Improvement
[7518.28s] it just takes time to roll this out like
[7520.32s] we&#39;re talking about tens of Millions of
[7521.96s] merchants and even the largest
[7523.44s] Enterprise ones it just takes time to
[7525.119s] get into their ecosystem we make a
[7527.079s] consumer change we launch PayPal
[7529.36s] everywhere it takes time I mean the fact
[7531.199s] that we got three million new PayPal
[7533.44s] everywhere debit card users in the first
[7535.92s] you know quarter and a half is it&#39;s
[7538.36s] insanely fast it is and it&#39;s still not
[7540.8s] good enough right because because
[7542.32s] everyone wants more and so absolutely
[7544.239s] look I don&#39;t know how long it&#39;s going to
[7546.8s] take for folks to sort of say hey we&#39;re
[7548.8s] gonna we understand that this leadership
[7551.159s] team is delivering on their on their
[7553.84s] commitments um but if you&#39;re looking for
[7557.52s] you know everything to turn around in in
[7559.599s] two months this probably isn&#39;t the right
[7561.4s] stock for you uh this is this is a
[7563.88s] business that we are building a flywheel
[7566.0s] that becomes the leader in in Commerce
[7569.119s] for the next decade and Beyond and that
[7572.159s] may take a few quarters or a couple of
[7573.8s] years and I think we were uh again we
[7576.719s] put out some um I think pretty exciting
[7580.639s] uh goals at yesterday in terms of what
[7582.88s] we think our long-term um transaction
[7584.84s] margin and EPS growth will look like we
[7587.719s] wouldn&#39;t put those out if we didn&#39;t have
[7589.0s] L line ofite to if we didn&#39;t know that
[7591.719s] hey when we execute uh on these growth
[7594.76s] levers and we&#39;ve got lots of growth
[7596.119s] levers now uh when we execute on this
[7598.36s] we&#39;re going to deliver it so you know
[7600.239s] again apologies that this isn&#39;t a fast
[7602.96s] you know flip of the switch and all of a
[7605.32s] sudden everything turns around but 800
[7608.04s] basis point Improvement in transaction
[7609.88s] margin in the first you know year is is
[7613.4s] pretty significant and uh I think we&#39;re
[7615.52s] just getting started yeah and the
[7618.599s] Topline numbers you know may not be what
[7620.44s] some people are expecting and hoping but
[7622.159s] the bottom line that&#39;s right I feel like
[7624.48s] PayPal has been lacking let&#39;s I mean
[7627.4s] let&#39;s talk about that so I got here and
[7629.8s] you know we had really good Revenue
[7631.36s] growth numbers right really good Revenue
[7633.719s] growth numbers empty calories right
[7636.719s] Revenue growth numbers with declining
[7639.239s] transaction margin so
[7642.559s] look it may be it may be uncomfortable
[7645.88s] and it may be the hard decisions but I&#39;m
[7647.92s] going to make the right decisions for
[7649.36s] the company for the long term and going
[7651.92s] back and having price to Value
[7653.52s] conversations I won&#39;t apologize for that
[7655.639s] I mean our our revenue is absolutely
[7659.32s] slowing for a period of time until we
[7662.88s] have these conversations but I can tell
[7664.199s] you the conversations we&#39;re having are
[7665.88s] incredible the conversations we&#39;re
[7667.76s] having with Merchants now to be able to
[7669.76s] price the value for them to be able to
[7671.239s] take all the different value added
[7673.0s] Services we&#39;re bringing together to now
[7674.599s] have conversations about ads we are
[7676.559s] having healthy relationships that are
[7678.4s] building the foundation for growth for
[7679.92s] the future so it is absolutely the right
[7682.199s] decision and we&#39;ve been as transparent
[7684.079s] as we can around hey revenue is going to
[7686.28s] come down for a couple of quarters and
[7688.159s] then we&#39;ll inflect and grow back but I
[7690.239s] would much rather rip the bandid off
[7692.48s] have the hard decisions and build this
[7694.199s] company for the long term then grab a
[7696.719s] couple more quarters of increasing empty
[7698.719s] calorie Revenue that&#39;s not delivering
[7700.36s] anything for the company for the long
[7701.719s] term but it looks really good and I I
[7704.719s] just don&#39;t want to do that I want to
[7705.92s] build this for the long term so if
[7707.639s] you&#39;re interested in in being with us
[7709.239s] for the longterm which I know you are uh
[7711.48s] then I think I think uh um this is the
[7714.04s] right place for you and and you know if
[7716.04s] you want a quarter of just you know Big
[7717.84s] Poppy headlines um is probably not us
[7720.679s] read uh all of all these um points the
[7725.599s] key key point being quote I
[7728.199s] fundamentally believe guest checkout is
[7730.0s] going to be a winner take all Market and
[7731.639s] the guest check checkout is the largest
[7733.92s] untapped
[7735.48s] opportunity there&#39;s also some talk
[7739.4s] about they
[7741.4s] brought the ad business became a monster
[7744.32s] business for Uber and a monster business
[7747.0s] for Amazon and they brought over the guy
[7749.92s] who ran that to now run ads in the
[7752.639s] PayPal Marketplace that is going to go
[7755.48s] straight to the bottom line there&#39;s so
[7758.199s] much stuff going on with checkout I mean
[7762.119s] uh you know it&#39;s interesting I rarely
[7764.28s] buy up but because you know we were
[7767.8s] aggressive on this in the high 50s uh
[7770.8s] and so on this you know new money coming
[7773.52s] in over the transom from existing
[7775.04s] customers is going right into PayPal
[7777.0s] okay that that&#39;s what I can tell you
[7778.239s] right now uh that I don&#39;t even have to
[7780.719s] think about they&#39;re going to buy back
[7782.079s] 15% of the company in the next two years
[7784.119s] even if none of this new stuff comes
[7785.76s] true which everything he said is going
[7787.4s] to come true is coming true uh and it&#39;s
[7789.88s] early days so I just love what they&#39;re
[7792.48s] doing and I think this thing is going to
[7794.0s] be a monster for us so uh go through the
[7796.4s] details I don&#39;t want to just go through
[7798.639s] the high lines and then there&#39;s some
[7799.96s] stuff on Hormel you can check out their
[7802.0s] cash flow and uh once they announce the
[7804.44s] new CEO this is going to recover and
[7806.28s] it&#39;s going to recover very very quickly
[7807.92s] because they&#39;ve got Legacy amazing
[7809.92s] brands that are right in The Sweet Spot
[7811.52s] here&#39;s extreme fear on the fear and
[7813.119s] greed this is where you want to be a
[7814.639s] buyer not a seller earnings uh top 30
[7818.04s] weights of Biotech down a bit for this
[7820.639s] this year and next next but uh it&#39;s it&#39;s
[7824.639s] already reflected in the price at this
[7826.48s] point same with equal weight and
[7830.52s] um Insider Buys in FMC we&#39;ve been
[7833.8s] talking about a lot of the a stocks uh
[7836.8s] and Insider buying in Advance Auto Parts
[7839.559s] this week so um and that&#39;s from like a
[7842.599s] low-level employee uh HR officer uh went
[7846.32s] into her pocket book and picked up uh I
[7849.639s] don&#39;t know $35 $40,000 $35,000 a stock
[7853.559s] it&#39;s it&#39;s a rounding error but for
[7855.52s] someone who is not an investor that&#39;s
[7858.0s] just an employee to write you know pull
[7860.239s] out their checkbook that&#39;s you know
[7861.679s] that&#39;s that&#39;s not nothing uh we talked
[7864.04s] about the earnings growth okay podcast
[7866.0s] is over now we&#39;re going to do the ask me
[7868.04s] anything questions for everyone who
[7869.679s] likes that part of our weekly show we&#39;re
[7873.079s] excited to cover that
[7875.44s] here so let&#39;s kick it off with
[7886.84s] Josh
[7888.28s] Jacobson thank you for the great work
[7890.159s] you do every week your consistency is on
[7891.679s] Match I want to get your opinion on
[7892.84s] Arista
[7894.04s] networks
[7895.83s] [Music]
[7901.4s] uh okay so he said valuation still looks
[7904.199s] a little Rich does it make sense to get
[7905.44s] into a great business even if the
[7906.559s] valuation is a little Rich no why would
[7908.0s] you get into where the valuation is Rich
[7910.76s] uh it&#39;s not the only stock in the market
[7912.44s] but let&#39;s see if that analysis is
[7915.36s] accurate uh I&#39;m probably 90% chance I&#39;m
[7918.719s] going to agree with you on that just
[7921.44s] pass wait till it comes to you and if it
[7923.0s] doesn&#39;t forget fomo or if it takes off
[7926.0s] without you so what uh this definitely
[7928.719s] looks like it&#39;s ready to bounce on a
[7929.96s] technical basis along with the mag 7 and
[7932.52s] many others so um if you&#39;re a Trader
[7935.0s] then you know have at it if you&#39;re an
[7937.199s] investor let&#39;s see what we&#39;re looking at
[7939.48s] here
[7946.44s] um here we go okay I forgot to turn this
[7950.199s] back that is default we like to zoom out
[7953.679s] here at hedge fund tips with Tom
[7956.679s] Hayes and not get caught up in the daily
[7959.28s] noise uh no way how&#39;s it save you time
[7963.48s] uh this is a stock that&#39;s up you know
[7965.28s] 30X in a handful of years it&#39;s got to
[7967.639s] rest this looks like a broken momentum
[7969.639s] stock and uh where you&#39;re going to get
[7972.199s] faked out is the fundamentals are going
[7974.119s] to come back down
[7976.28s] quicker well I mean this is this is kind
[7980.52s] of fascinating I I wouldn&#39;t be a buyer
[7982.96s] here I just just wait for a while and if
[7985.8s] you miss it you miss it um and I think
[7988.32s] you already know that so kudos to you
[7990.84s] from being a loyal listener not chasing
[7993.4s] shiny objects at the top and let other
[7995.96s] people be the bag holders on that JT
[7999.079s] investor could you shed some light on
[8001.4s] what caused vfc to drop this week uh the
[8006.4s] Market&#39;s going down people are
[8008.32s] overleveraged and they&#39;re getting smoked
[8010.44s] and nothing&#39;s changed in the fundamental
[8012.44s] uh plan and execution of Brack and Daryl
[8016.0s] um and uh and by the way if we zoom out
[8020.4s] I&#39;ll bet you can&#39;t even see it let&#39;s see
[8022.52s] VF Corp yeah so it&#39;s gone straight up
[8025.76s] for like three straight months it&#39;s
[8027.4s] going to correct and consolidate that&#39;s
[8028.84s] what they do that&#39;s what they do every
[8030.119s] single cycle straight up correct
[8032.119s] consolidate huge run straight up correct
[8034.88s] consolidate for here it was a year and
[8037.88s] then straight up so
[8041.239s] uh
[8043.679s] relax next Patrick
[8047.88s] B what&#39;s your take on the IT consulting
[8050.559s] service base I&#39;ve never liked it
[8054.239s] uh gft Technologies and the reason I&#39;ve
[8057.48s] never liked it is because your assets go
[8058.76s] down the elevator every day
[8061.44s] um so let&#39;s
[8063.09s] [Music]
[8064.559s] see
[8066.199s] gft
[8069.19s] [Music]
[8088.14s] [Music]
[8089.32s] Technologies um
[8093.0s] I you
[8096.36s] know I I don&#39;t like these businesses so
[8098.76s] I&#39;m going to just pass Mark
[8104.88s] Callaway uh says hey Tom and thank you
[8108.159s] for all that you do not lip service
[8109.559s] truly thank you I know you say it&#39;s a
[8111.92s] great time to pick individual stocks but
[8113.44s] do you have a preferred ETF to put my
[8115.44s] adult kids in that are brand new to
[8118.04s] investing uh so many I&#39;ve looked at are
[8121.719s] heavy on the mag 7
[8124.96s] uh I would do a combination you know do
[8128.28s] some us vti is less concentrated in the
[8132.159s] uh mag 7 and then uh vxus uh xus it&#39;s a
[8137.88s] good place to start with those two if
[8139.36s] you just want to pass it for the long
[8140.8s] term maybe some Emerging Markets uh and
[8144.04s] maybe some small c cap so iwm would be
[8147.559s] small cap Emerging Markets would be uh
[8151.599s] vwo or um
[8154.559s] e and um that&#39;s opinion not advice but a
[8159.44s] great question thanks for
[8161.88s] listening iore Barry thoughts on Porsche
[8165.96s] uh we do not M we do not buy car makers
[8169.599s] we
[8170.8s] buy part
[8172.96s] suppliers Daniel
[8175.0s] Borman what is your th thought on Ray
[8177.4s] Doo&#39;s warning that a US debt crisis
[8179.32s] could trigger a heart attack in the next
[8182.079s] three years
[8184.239s] um let&#39;s see Ray Dio
[8191.92s] crash
[8193.8s] okay so he said uh three days ago we&#39;re
[8197.2s] going to
[8198.359s] crash he
[8206.92s] said let&#39;s see market crash basically
[8209.719s] every two years
[8213.439s] um look anyway the point is the guy made
[8216.479s] a lot of money and uh he&#39;s
[8220.0s] effectively a bond commodity guy by
[8223.24s] training and these guys are always
[8225.359s] negative and the beauty of that is they
[8228.8s] get a ton of money because there is more
[8231.2s] AUM in debt instruments than there is in
[8234.479s] equities as the debt markets are much
[8236.399s] bigger than the credit markets and the
[8238.519s] way that you get people to invest in
[8240.559s] credit
[8241.679s] is by scaring the out of them and
[8243.84s] then they give you all their money and
[8245.08s] credit because they don&#39;t want to take
[8246.359s] Equity risk and
[8249.599s] um and that&#39;s that so look uh if you
[8253.519s] Google you will see every two years he
[8255.28s] says the Market&#39;s going to crash and the
[8257.599s] fact of the matter is
[8260.76s] um he was right in 2008 and he made a
[8264.16s] ton of
[8265.0s] money and um and you really only have to
[8268.08s] be right once or twice in life to make a
[8269.8s] fortune whether that&#39;s in buying
[8271.2s] businesses building businesses picking a
[8273.319s] wife uh you don&#39;t have to be right a
[8275.84s] million times and uh nor should everyone
[8279.88s] anyone expect people to be right I mean
[8281.76s] at the end of the day the guy made 14
[8283.24s] billion so so what if he made a few bad
[8285.639s] calls he made one or two right ones and
[8288.2s] uh and he made a fortune so I wouldn&#39;t
[8290.12s] worry about that uh he&#39;s going to be
[8291.679s] right again at some point I don&#39;t know
[8293.2s] if it&#39;s in three years or three months
[8295.0s] or or 20 years but um the message has
[8298.439s] been consistent let&#39;s just leave it at
[8299.88s] that Luca Milo
[8301.28s] thanks for the amazing content every
[8302.639s] week I share it with everyone that&#39;s
[8303.719s] interested in financial markets and they
[8305.16s] started following you too thank you very
[8307.04s] much uh what do you think leged plat uh
[8309.399s] it&#39;s a Furniture maker so it&#39;s going to
[8311.12s] be in the short term going to be hurt I
[8314.519s] think that uh it did have some balance
[8318.439s] sheet risk but
[8322.479s] uh you know it&#39;s in a big downtrend I
[8325.359s] mean the number one thing you need to do
[8326.8s] on this
[8328.439s] company is
[8335.559s] solvency
[8337.639s] risk but I think this could wind up
[8340.479s] being an interesting if not trade
[8344.0s] investment uh but this is the type of
[8347.04s] thing where i&#39; I&#39;d probably have to go
[8349.08s] understand the business really really
[8350.88s] carefully before so it looks like
[8352.96s] they&#39;ve got $350 million of cash and how
[8358.04s] much debt
[8361.24s] uh two billion so or 1.8 billion so you
[8363.519s] got to see when all that comes
[8365.559s] due uh you got to see what they&#39;re
[8367.84s] generating in terms of this is this is
[8370.519s] the
[8371.399s] issue uh let&#39;s see here cash from
[8373.88s] operations no cash from operations is
[8375.599s] not bad 305
[8378.12s] million uh free cash flow 224
[8382.92s] million so you just have to do the math
[8386.23s] [Music]
[8389.359s] on see cash from
[8400.439s] financing cash interest paid 84
[8407.8s] million you just have to see when all
[8409.92s] these come to but I like the idea I
[8412.08s] definitely like the idea Luca and it&#39;s
[8413.52s] probably worth some more
[8415.52s] work
[8419.12s] uh okay we got
[8427.52s] that okay this one is from Grayson
[8432.399s] Harris what sort of path in the finance
[8434.6s] industry would you recommend college
[8435.68s] students who enjoy value investing what
[8437.2s] sort of firm environment would your
[8438.56s] college grad be able to prosper in a
[8440.04s] solid value investor without going off
[8441.68s] on their own number one you can&#39;t you
[8444.28s] can try to go off on your own but
[8447.04s] uh uh I I&#39;m going to repeat it I would
[8451.359s] never suggest taking other people&#39;s
[8454.12s] money to manage until you have proven
[8456.56s] that you don&#39;t need any money because
[8457.96s] you&#39;ve made enough money in markets for
[8459.52s] yourself and you&#39;ve gone through two or
[8461.68s] three Cycles working for someone else um
[8465.399s] and proven that you have lived through
[8468.08s] enough cycles and you know what you&#39;re
[8469.6s] doing before you take on that enormous
[8472.72s] responsibility um because if you do it
[8474.92s] wrong and you do it early you will not
[8477.12s] recover uh and um I I don&#39;t I don&#39;t even
[8481.16s] say that remotely lightly that&#39;s uh you
[8484.0s] know serious is a heart attack with that
[8485.92s] advice um and then
[8489.96s] what what skills do you hone through
[8492.16s] value investing that are transferable to
[8493.88s] other sectors I think it&#39;s you know the
[8496.56s] the language of numbers is critical for
[8499.08s] any and all businesses as a matter of
[8501.0s] fact uh I I think it&#39;s critical if
[8503.84s] you&#39;re in school and you can take
[8506.0s] accounting courses and you can take
[8507.6s] finance courses I would say that your
[8511.2s] odds of success in being an entrepreneur
[8514.359s] and starting a business are much higher
[8517.28s] than your odds of success in as an
[8519.64s] investor and the people who do investing
[8522.88s] well uh make it look a lot easier than
[8527.88s] it is because for every word that comes
[8531.2s] out of their mouth there&#39;s probably
[8533.68s] 75 thoughts and uh historical Frameworks
[8538.56s] that are running in in the background
[8541.6s] that you don&#39;t know and can&#39;t understand
[8544.72s] without living through 20 plus years of
[8547.319s] markets so um that&#39;s number one number
[8552.52s] two
[8557.2s] um it&#39;s a lot more competitive than you
[8561.0s] think uh you know you&#39;re going against
[8564.08s] the
[8565.399s] smartest you
[8567.2s] know
[8568.96s] smart quot smartest students in the
[8571.92s] world smartest you know people got the
[8574.64s] highest grades and all all of that stuff
[8576.8s] so it&#39;s not a walk in the park I mean I
[8579.56s] if you absolutely love it and it&#39;s what
[8581.88s] you do you know if you if you wound up
[8583.72s] at another job and like all night long
[8585.68s] all you&#39;re doing is studying stocks and
[8587.479s] you don&#39;t go to bed till you get to your
[8588.76s] job and like it&#39;s what you love then
[8590.2s] it&#39;s probably what you should do but if
[8591.92s] it&#39;s like oh that&#39;s where I should go to
[8593.08s] make money because I can make more money
[8594.84s] ah huge huge life mistake uh you won&#39;t
[8597.359s] be able to compete with people who love
[8598.76s] to do it 247
[8600.76s] uh and you&#39;ll get you&#39;ll get smoked out
[8604.72s] um so my B best suggestion in your 20s
[8609.96s] is you don&#39;t have to be a
[8612.72s] genius you just have to be persistent
[8615.439s] and consistent and you could build a
[8617.6s] business that&#39;ll make you so much more
[8619.96s] money uh before you&#39;re 30 than you would
[8622.359s] ever make in the finance uh
[8625.04s] industry um but if you play the turtle
[8628.04s] hair game you know having the skill of
[8630.16s] being a a great investor uh when all is
[8632.56s] said and done by the time you&#39;re 50 uh
[8635.399s] you know the scales tip and and you got
[8637.52s] compounding in the rearview mirror and
[8639.0s] you might might wind up uh a lot further
[8640.96s] ahead but you really have to love it I
[8642.92s] would go to
[8644.359s] youtube.com under the hedge fund tips
[8646.479s] Channel and put in the search bar
[8648.68s] University of Bristol I did an hour
[8650.52s] interview with their investor Club on uh
[8653.68s] my suggestions if you do want to get
[8655.12s] into the business
[8658.2s] um it&#39;s a narrower
[8661.52s] opening than it was 20 years
[8664.84s] ago um when regulations were easy and
[8669.72s] anyone and their mother could start a
[8671.2s] hedge fund uh in the early 2000s and
[8673.56s] that all changed when the rules changed
[8676.24s] uh so it&#39;s a lot more expensive much
[8678.16s] higher barriers of Entry a lot fewer
[8681.56s] startups
[8683.52s] um but uh but also I like that because
[8688.279s] um
[8691.12s] it it creates a it creates a moat so uh
[8694.16s] or a small moat if you&#39;re really good at
[8695.68s] it and you love it uh so the short
[8699.2s] answer to your question is if you love
[8701.319s] it go for it you&#39;ll figure it out if you
[8704.08s] are just doing it because it looks like
[8705.76s] an easy way to make money uh absolutely
[8708.68s] do not go in this direction uh go build
[8712.04s] a business or or go work for someone
[8714.88s] first
[8715.99s] [Music]
[8717.72s] um I think there&#39;s so many unbelievable
[8720.319s] opportunities to make a ton of money as
[8722.12s] an entrepreneur nowadays with all the
[8725.08s] platforms available to you and all the
[8728.08s] ways to reach markets that have never
[8730.08s] existed if you have a good idea go for
[8732.399s] it and you may fail in two or three
[8733.84s] businesses in your 20s that&#39;s perfectly
[8735.52s] normal as an entrepreneur uh in finance
[8738.279s] you can&#39;t do that you can&#39;t blow up a
[8739.96s] fund and expect to ever come back I mean
[8742.359s] people do it but it&#39;s the exception not
[8744.72s] the rule so that&#39;s that you know on a
[8746.76s] business you can just rebound and do it
[8748.52s] again and do it again most entrepreneurs
[8749.96s] probably fail two or three times before
[8751.479s] they have their big big hit that would
[8754.0s] probably be an exciting way to live if
[8755.88s] if you don&#39;t know if you love investing
[8759.08s] uh but um but that&#39;s that uh Michael
[8762.84s] silver
[8767.279s] Tidewater I just go with Slumber Jay if
[8770.2s] you have to or
[8776.84s] um yeah
[8780.359s] this was obviously delution at some
[8783.12s] point I I I don&#39;t like that one even rig
[8786.24s] I don&#39;t like I I would just go up the
[8788.72s] food chain and go to something like SLB
[8791.92s] or
[8792.68s] HP or uh
[8795.08s] noov if you have to be in the space and
[8797.64s] you can&#39;t resist that that&#39;s probably
[8799.479s] more where I would be interested um but
[8802.0s] I don&#39;t have to so I won&#39;t uh moving
[8807.479s] on Christopher Williams block not
[8812.88s] interested we like PayPal I knew
[8821.399s] no David
[8837.0s] Martin Philip
[8841.96s] uh do you have a preference between
[8843.319s] Bungie or
[8845.16s] ADM uh I would go for Archer Daniels
[8856.56s] Midland
[8864.68s] RCI what is this thing is this a cable
[8867.439s] operator
[8887.52s] yeah Communications company wireless
[8889.399s] cable and media internet access I mean
[8892.12s] this is kind of like the Comcast story
[8893.92s] they all look interesting
[8895.96s] here
[8897.96s] um I think this probably could this will
[8901.399s] probably wind up working but uh I would
[8903.84s] definitely do some work on it here but
[8905.8s] if you&#39;re totally right you&#39;re going to
[8907.04s] get a double and I I don&#39;t think it&#39;s a
[8908.64s] good enough business to take that risk
[8910.279s] and I don&#39;t like I don&#39;t need to be
[8912.479s] totally right I like things that I can
[8914.279s] be half wrong and still make a triple in
[8916.479s] a few years so uh it&#39;s not for me Kyle
[8920.08s] Burns uh if you were the CEO of Advanced
[8922.439s] Auto Parts would you be doing something
[8923.72s] different than Chanel Kelly or do you
[8925.08s] feel that he&#39;s doing exact same way you
[8927.56s] would do things or is there room for
[8928.92s] improvement I I literally wouldn&#39;t
[8931.08s] change one thing that Shane o&#39; Kelly is
[8933.0s] doing as a matter of fact he&#39;s doing a
[8934.72s] better job than I would and that&#39;s why
[8936.8s] he&#39;s going to wind up with probably a
[8938.479s] triple if not more uh and that&#39;s why I
[8941.399s] just pick the jockeys versus having to
[8943.399s] implement the
[8944.6s] execution uh because I pick people who
[8946.8s] can do it better it&#39;s the same way it&#39;s
[8948.6s] the same reason that people are who are
[8951.64s] you know sentim Millionaires and
[8953.8s] billionaires pick me to manage their
[8955.479s] money it&#39;s not because they couldn&#39;t
[8957.8s] learn it and do it it&#39;s because they&#39;re
[8960.279s] already rich so they&#39;re going to
[8961.279s] delegate to someone who specialized that
[8963.399s] they don&#39;t do it all day for 20 years uh
[8966.52s] and just like I&#39;m going to delegate to
[8968.479s] Shane o Kelly who&#39;s been doing this
[8971.16s] stuff for three decades between Home
[8973.2s] Depot Supply and other successful runs
[8975.96s] uh and you can hear his whole interview
[8978.359s] and Brack and Daryl from Old Spice days
[8981.0s] to Logitech to Proctor and Gamble I mean
[8984.16s] these guys that&#39;s all they&#39;ve done for
[8985.84s] decades so I&#39;m going to delegate the
[8987.88s] execution to them because they&#39;re going
[8989.2s] to be the best out of it&#39;s not because
[8991.24s] you know Shane o Kelly is 10 IQ points
[8994.64s] higher than Tom Hayes therefore he&#39;s
[8996.12s] doing a better job it&#39;s because that&#39;s
[8997.399s] all he does uh and and and so on and so
[9001.0s] forth so the the
[9003.6s] more successful people you meet the more
[9006.8s] you will realize that they delegate more
[9011.399s] than you would ever imagine doing
[9014.0s] you the things that you could do are
[9018.2s] different than the things you should do
[9021.08s] the good is the enemy the better is the
[9022.68s] enemy of the best if you are not doing
[9024.68s] your highest and best
[9028.16s] value and you&#39;re not
[9031.24s] delegate and you&#39;re not delegating
[9033.359s] you&#39;re doing a disservice to the world
[9035.08s] so I&#39;m at a stage now where I&#39;m
[9037.92s] delegating everything that&#39;s not picking
[9041.52s] stocks or interacting with clients the
[9044.399s] things that I do best uh everything else
[9047.84s] is has been effectively
[9050.72s] delegated now more or less I&#39;d say I&#39;m
[9054.359s] if I&#39;m not 80% there I&#39;m 80 90% there
[9058.24s] and all I have to think about nowadays
[9061.52s] is um picking stocks which is what I
[9065.16s] love to do which is my highest and best
[9066.56s] use because you you you don&#39;t outperform
[9068.92s] by consensus any of the best funds in
[9070.72s] the world it&#39;s one or two people and
[9072.479s] usually one person making all the
[9073.96s] decisions and then they have support
[9075.56s] staff to get everything else done and
[9077.439s] operations and excellence and all of
[9079.52s] that stuff
[9081.04s] um uh and by the way that was the case
[9083.319s] for for diio by the way uh and uh I know
[9086.6s] his number two extremely well played
[9088.12s] poker with him for 10 years and um they
[9091.399s] made effectively all the decisions even
[9093.479s] though they had a thousand people they
[9094.6s] had a thousand bodies why because when
[9096.92s] pensions come in to see you uh they have
[9101.52s] this metric and the more bodies you have
[9103.359s] in seats doing busy work the bigger the
[9105.56s] check they&#39;re allowed to write you so if
[9107.64s] you want you know $200 million from a
[9110.479s] pension fund you better have 50 people
[9113.359s] sitting in seats uh whether they&#39;re
[9115.359s] doing anything or not is immaterial uh
[9118.68s] it just it just pays to pay them a
[9120.479s] salary to sit there so you can get a
[9121.88s] bigger check from a pension I&#39;m not in
[9123.479s] that game I&#39;ve never optimized for
[9125.439s] maximum a I&#39;ve always optimized for
[9128.479s] quality of life doing what I love and
[9130.88s] making sure that every single partner I
[9132.92s] have every investor is someone that I
[9134.64s] enjoy respect and would hang out with
[9137.12s] whether or not we did business and if I
[9139.08s] meet that I live happy life they live a
[9140.92s] happy life everything&#39;s good and if I
[9143.0s] optimize for AUM and I start dealing
[9145.479s] with 12-year olds with clipboards
[9147.24s] counting the number bodies and seeds it
[9148.84s] takes me away from doing what I do best
[9150.68s] which is picking stocks so uh that&#39;s how
[9152.76s] I&#39;ve decided to live my life and it
[9154.2s] works great for me um okay
[9159.68s] so uh
[9162.359s] David
[9165.2s] okay thoughts on docu or valet
[9173.279s] doy
[9175.92s] sign I I I don&#39;t really have an interest
[9178.479s] in this I I don&#39;t all right let&#39;s try
[9186.96s] valet valet will probably work for a
[9189.279s] trade but I mean you&#39;re lucky to make a
[9190.88s] double if everything goes right so uh
[9194.04s] for me no but I think valy is ready to
[9198.479s] go Nick
[9201.92s] thank you for all your wisdom and help
[9203.0s] with things in stock market I&#39;m an avid
[9204.68s] listener every week over here in the UK
[9206.2s] want to ask your thought about Powell
[9209.439s] Industries
[9211.359s] uh okay P
[9214.439s] WL thank you by the way for all of the
[9217.8s] Avid listeners and particularly those
[9220.6s] folks uh
[9222.279s] no no this was a 20 bagger it&#39;s a broken
[9225.479s] momentum stock I don&#39;t want to buy it up
[9227.52s] here regardless of how good the
[9228.68s] fundamentals look now because the stock
[9231.16s] is telling me that the fundamentals are
[9232.68s] probably going to deteriorate pretty
[9234.04s] quickly so uh for me that&#39;s a
[9236.52s] pass um David
[9238.7s] [Music]
[9240.359s] Gavin look at
[9242.64s] Denny&#39;s ah these are
[9247.08s] tough I mean we&#39;re over restaured here
[9249.6s] in the US all this is is a debt story
[9268.56s] let&#39;s take a look at the balance sheet
[9269.96s] here
[9273.92s] because question is is whether this
[9276.399s] thing why is the cash so low these
[9278.52s] numbers have to be
[9282.479s] wrong if these numbers are right Run for
[9284.88s] the hills I think these numbers are
[9286.8s] wrong says they got $3 million of cash
[9290.359s] and uh $261 million of debt um I don&#39;t
[9295.12s] know that that can be right let&#39;s see
[9297.0s] what their free cash flow
[9300.12s] is this this
[9302.439s] is this is not for me I mean it looks
[9305.2s] like it wants to bounce from a trading
[9306.6s] perspective for sure and it is a legacy
[9309.2s] brand but uh that&#39;s just going to go in
[9311.399s] my to Hard
[9313.279s] Box uh
[9316.359s] Alex CK Hutchinson Holdings Hong Kong I
[9319.96s] will not buy any Chinese stock other
[9321.64s] than Alibaba and if I had to buy one or
[9324.04s] two more it would be ba and 10 cent uh I
[9328.439s] I don&#39;t I won&#39;t buy any midcaps or small
[9330.0s] caps I&#39;m not taking country and Company
[9331.6s] risk I mean our our original thesis with
[9333.84s] ba baba was if if uh if Baba goes down
[9338.2s] so does China I mean that&#39;s basically
[9340.04s] what it comes down to so
[9342.8s] uh I&#39;ve seen too many frauds in China
[9345.6s] over the years I&#39;ve seen people get
[9347.0s] burned by frauds in China every cycle I
[9349.68s] won&#39;t I mean no way I mean Alibaba has
[9353.84s] been stress tested over and over there
[9355.6s] are tons of outs I&#39;m not going to play
[9357.319s] in other stock so you know if you want a
[9359.12s] lagard in China because everything else
[9361.2s] has moved up if I had to take buy put a
[9364.08s] ton of new money to work in China and I
[9366.04s] didn&#39;t want to chase up baba uh I&#39;d
[9368.6s] probably start to take a hard look at
[9370.96s] Buu um and that&#39;ll be a a lower quality
[9374.2s] but catch up but as far as betting on
[9376.2s] like obscure stocks that I have no Edge
[9379.359s] uh hard pass because we&#39;re going to pull
[9381.96s] up the numbers they&#39;re going to look
[9383.12s] great and then there&#39;s a coin flip
[9385.16s] chance in nine months it turns out to be
[9386.76s] a fraud and there&#39;s nothing like uh you
[9389.72s] can do about it you have no
[9391.8s] Edge
[9393.88s] um James sent me a nice article in the
[9397.56s] Ft you can probably check
[9401.479s] out uh it says investors should be worry
[9405.439s] of analyst ratings
[9409.8s] you know and I make the joke of
[9412.92s] how Morgan Stanley downgraded China and
[9416.04s] Alibaba at $70 and now they&#39;re upgrading
[9418.279s] it at $140 so uh this article kind of
[9421.479s] embodies that and it&#39;s not just Morgan
[9423.24s] Stanley and it&#39;s not just China it
[9425.2s] happens over and over and over when the
[9427.0s] stock is down they all downgrade in the
[9428.64s] hole when the stock is up they all
[9430.12s] upgrade at the top uh and that&#39;s and
[9433.16s] that&#39;s the name of the game so analysts
[9435.0s] are now flipping on Baba because you
[9436.84s] know the price has doubled up plus uh
[9439.56s] but it&#39;s just the beginning they will
[9440.8s] start to come in herds and after it gets
[9443.479s] over 200 everyone will be upgrading and
[9445.92s] you
[9446.6s] know when it&#39;s beyond that you will see
[9449.24s] everyone uniformly uh bullish uh in the
[9453.12s] 200s with price targets over 300 and
[9456.0s] that&#39;s when you have to start to look
[9457.68s] carefully at fundamentals but we&#39;re
[9459.399s] nowhere near that point four years this
[9462.359s] is from Matt in North Carolina four
[9464.12s] years of listening to the best content
[9465.64s] available on the internet never miss
[9467.6s] thank you thank you I appreciate your
[9469.76s] loyal support Trump suggests get rid of
[9472.24s] the chips during his speech Taiwan
[9474.56s] semiconductor going to build foundaries
[9475.84s] in the US I mean good luck and Boeing is
[9478.52s] going to build planes for Southwest get
[9480.08s] in line for 25 years I mean if Taiwan
[9482.64s] semiconductor starts today they&#39;re going
[9484.479s] to have to go through 10 of billions
[9486.04s] like Intel already did four to six years
[9489.16s] uh before they even have a chance and uh
[9492.279s] and by then the AI Revolution is long in
[9494.72s] the tooth so uh Intel&#39;s going to be the
[9497.88s] beneficiary whether they partner with
[9500.0s] Taiwan semiconductor to have Taiwan
[9502.72s] semiconductor operate I wouldn&#39;t bet on
[9504.52s] it um and I would fire the board and I
[9508.12s] would bring Ginger back but more likely
[9510.399s] than not they will bring some big name
[9513.439s] in and they&#39;ll get the job done and
[9515.279s] ginger will get no credit even though he
[9517.08s] did 90% of the work uh and the new face
[9519.96s] will get all the credit and go to the
[9522.2s] promised land so sometimes in life
[9523.76s] better to be lucky than to be good that
[9525.64s] will be the next CEO of Intel Griffin
[9532.2s] Brown
[9533.76s] uh Cooper
[9541.88s] standard uh you mentioned Paris
[9544.76s] companies like Coop sandard will not
[9546.359s] move plans to the US to save money
[9547.8s] recently I&#39;ve been seeing many headlines
[9549.84s] about companies mainly vehicle moving
[9551.399s] plans to the US due to tariffs what are
[9553.0s] your
[9553.68s] thoughts
[9555.399s] um this has been happening for years
[9557.76s] some some you know Toyota builds cars in
[9560.399s] Tennessee I mean the the oems will
[9563.0s] probably do it will the part suppliers I
[9566.88s] mean a lot of this is also going to be
[9569.2s] symbolic to appease the the
[9571.279s] administration and make the
[9572.76s] administration look like they&#39;re doing
[9574.08s] the things that they said they&#39;re going
[9575.0s] to do but to invest material amounts of
[9578.68s] money for three and a half years and by
[9580.279s] the time the factory is done there&#39;s a
[9582.04s] new Administration in and your
[9583.72s] competitors are going to be going
[9584.8s] offshore for cheaper Labor uh you will
[9587.8s] see
[9590.04s] it&#39;s a cost benefit analysis okay so if
[9592.92s] they think that they&#39;re going to save
[9594.24s] money on tariffs by building a few
[9595.88s] factories in the US they will do that uh
[9599.52s] but they also is time value of money and
[9601.56s] you&#39;re talking about a three and a half
[9602.6s] year window so it&#39;s going to be the
[9604.439s] headlines are going to be more than you
[9605.72s] think the reality is going to be less
[9607.359s] than you think and at the end of the day
[9609.96s] you still have the average car on the
[9612.04s] road 13.5 years you still have the bulk
[9614.439s] of the population at 34 when they all
[9616.76s] move out to the suburbs have a kid and
[9618.52s] buy a second car
[9620.359s] um that&#39;s not going to change if the
[9622.399s] price of uh a piece of rubber goes from
[9626.92s] you know $190 a car to $210 a car and
[9630.8s] your MSRP goes from you know $50,000 to
[9633.92s] $50,000 20 because the rubber got more
[9636.56s] expensive it it really is is immaterial
[9638.64s] you know if you&#39;re selling Transmissions
[9639.88s] maybe that&#39;s a different story if your
[9641.84s] part goes from 7,000 to uh 8,500 you
[9645.52s] might have a problem but if it goes from
[9646.92s] you know 190 to 2110 it&#39;s like it&#39;s it&#39;s
[9649.359s] a rounding error and it&#39;s going to be
[9650.52s] passed through to the oems and then
[9654.2s] through the customers but also if
[9656.0s] interest rates go down and then you have
[9657.439s] tax deductibility on the auto loan uh
[9660.6s] that&#39;s a big deal that&#39;s a big deal Bill
[9663.72s] McGrew thanks for doing such a great
[9665.84s] podcast I never miss it wondering what
[9667.319s] your thought of
[9669.2s] APA a little cheaper than com stock on a
[9672.72s] Enterprise Value to free cash flow that
[9674.399s] is not a metric you would use for an
[9676.6s] energy company you&#39;re looking at proved
[9678.92s] and improved reserves value um I think
[9682.96s] it&#39;s uh I think apache&#39;s okay and I
[9686.64s] think that uh Comstock has more upside
[9689.92s] on a multiple basis so we&#39;re already at
[9692.399s] uh double and a half
[9694.76s] on
[9697.279s] uh 2 and a half X on comto resources I
[9701.439s] wouldn&#39;t bet on aache even being a
[9704.04s] double and I think Comstock is going to
[9706.96s] probably uh double again from here
[9709.8s] so that&#39;ll be like four 5x and um not
[9713.6s] will not be the case with Apache if
[9716.96s] you&#39;re lucky with aache you&#39;ll be up 50%
[9719.12s] so I would just uh leave it at that
[9721.52s] that&#39;s that&#39;s not the way you value this
[9724.64s] type of company but uh longtime listener
[9726.92s] can you look at
[9728.08s] halberton yeah I like halberton better
[9731.2s] than I like Tidewater um let&#39;s just put
[9735.319s] that in here but I think you you know I
[9738.64s] think you&#39;re taking some kind of risk
[9740.0s] for a maximum maximum double uh
[9745.0s] it&#39;s it&#39;s not that it&#39;s not terribly
[9747.8s] exciting for me but yeah if you want
[9749.24s] energy exposer it&#39;s probably
[9753.279s] okay
[9755.319s] uh okay statman emailed in from linta
[9759.84s] the wonderful high school that I had the
[9761.68s] pleasure to speak with a few weeks
[9765.56s] back uh nope that&#39;s not his let&#39;s see
[9770.12s] what note did he
[9772.76s] say no that&#39;s the old stuff
[9776.64s] okay well what he was saying was
[9786.279s] that his students were doing having a
[9788.76s] great time listening to it and I&#39;m very
[9791.319s] grateful that they&#39;ve stuck with it and
[9792.88s] I hope it makes a difference for a
[9794.359s] handful of them that uh go on to have
[9797.359s] incredible careers and uh
[9804.0s] do great things Bill
[9808.04s] C thanks for all you do to help us
[9810.8s] retail investors I know you were bullish
[9812.68s] on healthc care uh thesis has already
[9815.56s] played out in a large cap healthc care
[9818.2s] space uh xbi yes we like xbi we own
[9824.52s] xbi uh small cap value ETFs absolutely
[9829.88s] uh your spot on
[9838.72s] there Paul Rosenberg is asking about
[9841.68s] that gaming company in Europe again
[9844.96s] Evo uh I don&#39;t like those businesses
[9848.96s] because they are very cyclical this is
[9853.56s] broken it&#39;s going to take a year or two
[9855.279s] to
[9855.96s] base uh so you know if it&#39;s between $2
[9858.56s] and $4 in a year send it back in and
[9861.0s] we&#39;ll probably buy it or at least say
[9862.96s] yes buy it but I think it&#39;s too early
[9865.2s] Chinese stock GDs no
[9867.6s] interest uh Tara Smith Terry Smith love
[9871.72s] your podcast boo Allen Hamilton no don&#39;t
[9875.8s] like it I I don&#39;t like the Consulting
[9877.92s] businesses when they run they&#39;re
[9879.64s] unbelievable but
[9882.08s] um not for me I&#39;m going to
[9885.04s] pass
[9886.56s] uh uh let&#39;s see
[9897.04s] here we have a lot of questions this
[9902.399s] week which is
[9904.439s] great Jimmy
[9906.84s] Jones when do you suspect ant group IPO
[9910.56s] uh probably in the next year would be my
[9912.279s] best guess if not sooner uh we own 35%
[9915.76s] of it so uh it probably adds
[9922.68s] initially 2030 billion and then over
[9925.52s] time probably 100 B billion dollars
[9927.56s] worth of value that&#39;s not in the stock
[9930.279s] uh David
[9936.52s] McLean
[9939.2s] Gregs g r e g
[9944.479s] GS uh that&#39;s interesting
[9950.08s] I think it&#39;s a fast food
[9961.12s] chain so cash flow has been
[9963.08s] deteriorating for two straight years
[9964.84s] while revenue&#39;s been going up margins
[9966.76s] are going down so just tell me how
[9968.84s] they&#39;re going to turn this around why
[9970.16s] are margins
[9971.84s] down
[9975.12s] uh how much is a stock down
[9980.439s] about
[9982.479s] 40% what&#39;s the balance sheet look
[10001.24s] like half a billion of
[10007.16s] leases let&#39;s cash look
[10026.12s] like what&#39;s the Share account
[10029.0s] doing looks like they&#39;re expanding
[10031.359s] they&#39;re probably investing in a lot of
[10032.52s] new stories is my
[10034.84s] guess uh where&#39;s the share count
[10039.24s] yeah I mean this thing looks at first
[10041.319s] blush is definitely worth more work I
[10043.04s] think you&#39;re probably okay here or near
[10046.04s] here uh you know 1500 I&#39;d be probably a
[10050.479s] lot more interested, 1600 but I I think
[10053.0s] if you&#39;re longterm you&#39;re probably going
[10054.52s] to be okay but I don&#39;t know the business
[10056.359s] so you got to really understand the
[10057.64s] business like is there something wrong
[10059.319s] with the business has it fallen out of
[10060.88s] fashion or is it just a normal cyclical
[10064.24s] trough um what is it
[10067.16s] Gregs food on the go retailer in the UK
[10070.04s] Kingdom you United Kingdom let&#39;s see
[10073.2s] what they
[10076.399s] sell okay accept all
[10079.96s] cookies
[10086.64s] Craigs nation&#39;s favorite sausage
[10091.68s] roll uh
[10098.88s] oh it&#39;s like a fast
[10102.479s] casual yeah I mean the numbers look okay
[10104.92s] I I don&#39;t really have an edge here but
[10107.88s] it generally spes the smell test and
[10109.92s] would be warranted to do a lot more work
[10112.479s] before making a material position but
[10115.88s] uh I you know it&#39;s if you&#39;re 100% right
[10120.68s] you you have probably a maximum of a
[10122.279s] double and it&#39;s going to take you a few
[10123.6s] years which is okay uh
[10132.72s] hi Tom I&#39;m following this is from uh
[10136.439s] Pete B
[10138.479s] bastarts I&#39;m following your show for two
[10140.56s] years and really like your style and
[10141.76s] expertise in my quest to educate myself
[10143.6s] in the investing space your podcast as
[10145.2s] much watch weekly and by the way you&#39;re
[10147.04s] the number one reference I share with
[10148.2s] friends and family because of the unique
[10150.359s] macro and micro combo could you take a
[10152.279s] look at umore EUR European material
[10155.6s] stock
[10163.479s] uh just wrote off the battery recycling
[10167.2s] okay yeah the question is whether they
[10169.359s] fired the CEO who made that decision
[10172.88s] that&#39;s that&#39;s the key if it&#39;s the same
[10175.12s] idiot running it uh that&#39;s not ideal
[10190.319s] to make a enormous bet on battery
[10192.92s] recycling just tells me that there&#39;s a
[10194.76s] screw missing in his head so uh
[10204.12s] umor yeah I mean this is down a lot my
[10206.96s] guess is the balance Sheet&#39;s going to be
[10208.439s] looking shaky here
[10226.16s] no two billion of cash 2.4 billion of
[10230.04s] debt what&#39;s going on with uh free cash
[10239.6s] flow
[10246.16s] investing yeah balance
[10249.88s] sheet it&#39;s good income
[10254.84s] statement this is a pretty big drop off
[10257.399s] revenues have cut in
[10264.12s] half all right so they made a
[10269.68s] bet precious metals business minting
[10275.399s] cash also various other units
[10280.0s] God I I just want to know how are these
[10282.52s] revenues going to
[10283.8s] stabilize um balance sheet looks okay
[10287.08s] but you got to look and see when does
[10288.64s] all that debt mature this thing is a
[10291.16s] falling knife but uh you could have an
[10295.12s] opportunity there I would really love to
[10296.96s] see this CEO
[10299.279s] fired who made an all-in bet on battery
[10302.16s] recycling oh excuse me former
[10306.72s] CEO I think he might have some I think
[10309.0s] this is worth looking into uh good
[10311.52s] work so I&#39;m going to write that one down
[10317.359s] yumore all right good
[10319.8s] work
[10327.279s] uh and I think
[10351.239s] I think well s sorry statman I don&#39;t
[10353.56s] have let&#39;s see CU he sent it to my great
[10356.8s] Hill Capital email and you got it when
[10359.2s] you&#39;re trying to get something on the
[10360.439s] ask me anything guys please uh send it
[10364.319s] to go to hedge fund tips.com and click
[10366.479s] on contact do not
[10372.439s] okay all right so okay so here&#39;s what
[10374.8s] cork
[10376.16s] says uh my kids are having more fun and
[10378.92s] more and the conversations are better
[10380.279s] than ever with their stock market game
[10382.56s] fictitious 10K to start the game ever
[10384.279s] since you came to lint High School
[10386.0s] Alibaba is a daily conversation and the
[10387.68s] kids are generally asking better and
[10389.04s] more insightful questions than they had
[10390.479s] in the past stats is always a lively
[10393.279s] subject
[10395.2s] anyway
[10397.279s] uh but you have added to the circus that
[10400.319s] my classes are in a fun way keep up the
[10401.84s] great work all right cork well you keep
[10403.72s] up the great work uh hello to all the
[10405.8s] students at linta High School uh out
[10409.08s] here in Orange County and uh very very
[10412.88s] glad to hear that made a difference all
[10414.92s] right so let&#39;s see if we have one
[10416.64s] more uh ask me anything question and
[10419.319s] then we&#39;ll call it a
[10424.479s] day uh
[10427.04s] Akamai AK k a m this is
[10430.359s] from Oz SMA
[10441.02s] [Music]
[10473.16s] yeah I mean I think this is going to be
[10474.52s] one of those where you got to be 100%
[10476.52s] right to make a 50% return and I I just
[10480.08s] think that I I like this I I just go for
[10483.239s] softballs down the middle where I can be
[10485.08s] half wrong and still make a triple uh
[10487.52s] these type of things you&#39;re just you&#39;re
[10489.359s] you&#39;re getting in front of Steamrollers
[10490.96s] for pennies uh I think you&#39;re going to
[10493.239s] be fine with this but it&#39;s not something
[10496.72s] that I would take uh great free cash
[10499.8s] flow it&#39;s okay I mean I it&#39;s not a great
[10503.88s] business let me see the balance sheet
[10505.399s] real quick looks
[10511.76s] okay two billion two billion income
[10515.76s] statement
[10520.479s] yeah it&#39;s okay it&#39;s not something I
[10521.96s] would do though I need doubles and
[10523.8s] triples to get interested I don&#39;t think
[10525.12s] you&#39;re going to get it with Emi uh Dan
[10529.96s] flicker Tom thank you so much for the
[10532.279s] value that you provide I&#39;ll continue to
[10533.92s] spread the word about the incredible
[10535.04s] podcast thank you Daniel that&#39;s the
[10537.2s] number one way to pay back uh wondering
[10539.6s] what your framework is with broken
[10541.0s] momentum stocks take Celsius for example
[10543.56s] what are you looking for in a bottom
[10546.279s] process uh I could care about price
[10548.92s] multiples at that point I want to see
[10550.92s] balance sheet cash flow statement they
[10552.56s] just tend to take a while because they
[10554.439s] you know so many in institutions and
[10558.2s] Retail
[10561.92s] Traders
[10571.96s] Celsius got smoked you know so it&#39;s
[10574.72s] going to take a long time to rebuild
[10579.04s] a shareholder
[10584.96s] base
[10588.479s] um this one is interesting though so uh
[10592.96s] I think it just got to be super patient
[10596.16s] I think this one might be actually okay
[10598.319s] here we&#39;ve looked at it a number of
[10599.88s] times I hate to even take the time to do
[10602.359s] it I I think this one&#39;s generally going
[10603.92s] to be
[10605.12s] okay but
[10608.88s] you just you have to do a lot of work
[10611.239s] you got to understand like what
[10614.92s] why first off you need to understand the
[10617.64s] short story why is it down so much uh
[10620.479s] and what&#39;s the story is it the stuff in
[10622.16s] it makes you sick or is it something
[10625.04s] else and what are they doing to resolve
[10626.96s] and alleviate that what&#39;s happening with
[10628.92s] volumes and why did they have to buy
[10630.96s] Acquisitions to reignite growth versus
[10633.52s] continue to grow organically did they
[10635.64s] stall um but I think the balance is
[10638.56s] probably okay
[10640.08s] here uh liability long-term debt looks
[10643.52s] good let&#39;s take a look at income
[10647.16s] statement uh
[10649.0s] 1.3
[10650.56s] billion so they&#39;re kind of stalling I
[10652.84s] mean this is the problem they were
[10653.88s] doubling every year and then they
[10655.16s] stalled
[10656.399s] out um and sometimes they stall out
[10659.399s] before they declin sometimes they stall
[10661.399s] out before they re accelerate so you got
[10663.279s] to be clear on the international story
[10665.8s] why are they stalling is it is the
[10667.56s] market limit or did they was it a fad or
[10670.88s] is it durable like monster beverage was
[10673.2s] one of the greatest stocks of all time
[10675.359s] Hansen uh and uh what are we doing with
[10678.359s] the share count
[10684.16s] here they&#39;re adding a lot of shares man
[10687.319s] I don&#39;t like
[10689.52s] that uh
[10701.239s] this one&#39;s definitely worth doing more
[10702.64s] work
[10703.439s] on because I do think you can get a
[10705.6s] doubler triple if you&#39;re
[10707.399s] right um so I&#39;ll write that one down
[10711.68s] again just it&#39;s it&#39;s very hard to have
[10714.56s] an edge because you&#39;re kind of
[10715.64s] predicting the future of consumer fads
[10717.68s] because it&#39;s not not been around long
[10719.04s] enough and there it&#39;s a very crowded
[10720.72s] space unlike when monster beverage came
[10723.0s] to Market unlike when Red Bull came to
[10725.439s] Market that doesn&#39;t mean it can&#39;t be
[10726.84s] done just
[10728.72s] uh it&#39;s not a
[10738.2s] guarantee
[10740.399s] okay and I
[10747.16s] think we have nailed it and we&#39;ve done
[10750.0s] all of the questions so with that said
[10752.92s] uh very very grateful to all of you who
[10755.52s] have been tuning in getting in
[10756.68s] tremendous value all I ask
[10759.0s] uh um is to like subscribe and share to
[10763.359s] the YouTube YouTube channel and that&#39;ll
[10765.2s] keep the machine going and we&#39;ll be able
[10767.319s] to do this for many years to come thank
[10769.439s] any of my clients when you see them
[10771.239s] wearing green Vans uh around they all
[10774.08s] got green Vans for Christmas uh so uh
[10777.359s] definitely thank them for uh indirectly
[10779.92s] underwriting and uh grateful all around
[10782.479s] so thank you we&#39;ll be back next week
[10784.04s] same time same place in the meantime
[10785.8s] make it a great one bye for now
