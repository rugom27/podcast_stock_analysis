welcome to hedge fun tips with Tom Hayes I'm Tom Hayes and this is your 277th videoast podcast for the week ending February 6 2025 got a lot to get to this week a lot of exciting stuff but family first as always uh that's me with Annabelle the girls had something like eight games between them this weekend for water polo pretty exciting I had the pleasure to speak to an amazing group about 4 or 500 high school students at linta High School in Westminster California home of the Aztecs uh really incredible time we're going to go into that a little bit here today want to thank cork Snider the AP Statistics teacher over at linta high school he has a Tik Tock Channel called statman for those of you who want amazing tutorials on statistics definitely check out statman on Tik Tok thanks again cork for organizing everything he's been a longtime listener uh very grateful for that uh this was a just a picture showing Chinese retaliation against us tariffs you can see 15% tariff on us LNG and coal Imports 10% on us oil pickup trucks farm equipment and uh restrict critical mineral exports and antimonopoly probe into to Google the consensus on this was that China's response implied they have more to lose than we do it appears there will not be an escalation Beyond this uh as it relates to China so that's a constructive outcome and we're seeing it there here were the students as uh they were finishing up I this must no this is when they were just coming in or just leaving anyway uh this was packed once we got going and uh this shows the uh trade differential uh by country so China's the biggest euro is the second biggest Mexico Vietnam and Taiwan and that's one of the other teachers and then uh in one of the games had one goal just to show one of their kids' goals I love this one from Mimi she gets a breakway way incredible pass from her team we puts it away and we're off to it the other thing since I had the privilege to talk to these amazing students uh cork students over there at linta I wanted to just kind of go through some books that I thought were important as a reading list we get that question quite a bit uh so first Seth clar's margin of safety Ben Grahams intelligent investor Ben Graham security analysis Peter Lynch one up on Wall Street Peter Lynch beating the street Joel greenblat you can be a stock market genius thoron OG glove the quality of earnings Lawrence Cunningham essays of Warren Buffett Robert hagstrom the Warren Buffett way and Christine Richard Confidence Game uh and then finally a few others here uh inside the Investments of Warren Buffett 20 cases from Lou uh margin of safety with claran we covered that measuring the moat by malbus I think he's over at Morgan Stanley he writes some really good stuff uh value investing by Greenwald poor Charlie's Almanac of course uh psychology of human misjudgment by Munger The Outsiders by Thorndike for sure uh quality investing by I Cunningham and why Moes matter by Collins and Brilliant so those are some things for the students to read if they want to go in this direction for sure then I would like to thank Christian dagger Preston miselle and the great Stuart vanney for having me on Monday when the market was down I think the D was down like 500 points or 600 points in the morning they texted me hey can you do a phoner real quick and tell us what's going on so I was grateful and happy to do that we did that so we're going to listen in here on that market it is a sell-off we're not coming back much at all the Dow's off 600 Nas NASDAQ down 470 S&P is down 110 uh on the phone joining us now to cover this Market Thomas Hayes all right Thomas um this is a big sell-off do you see any buying are you buying anything this is a big dip you're buying anything I've got my shopping list ready stew I think this is a great opportunity look Goldman Sachs was out this morning saying if this is fully implemented and they don't come to any agreements today you're looking at EPS dropping 2 to 3% and maximum on the S&P 500 down 5% so I think the way to look at this is we're looking across our positions in the portfolio things that we love before Friday we still love we're going to be slowly adding in over the next couple of days we're going to be looking for new opportunities I mean look earnings have been phenomenal you you know we we're 77% beat rate 13.2% earnings growth we had a positive January if history is any prolog that means the uh S&P is up 89% of the time so there's a lot to like here and then we just saw the ISM Manufacturing Index come in better than expected we're coming out of a 2year manufacturing depression in the United States this is a positive thing okay give me a name or two what are you buying well look I'll tell you one that I've talked about with your viewers on the show uh it's up about 10% with since we started talking about it is Etsy is the beneficiary of this di Minimus uh exemption that teu and Sheen has been taking advantage of they're no longer going to get away with shipping junk into this country under 800 bucks with no tariff so Etsy who has the uh domestic people make the products is up today on this news tremendous company billion dollar buyback recovering internationally growing the men's business growing the gifting business so that's one that we want to add to on this uh sell off Etsy I shall remember that the chotsky store as I tend to call it Thomas H thanks very much indeed and we're back and then on Wednesday I had the privilege of doing a normal spot um which was a great segment uh right here also with Stuart thanks to Christian and to Preston we're going to listen in here an investigation into Apple's App Store and that's taken 2% off Apple stock down to 227 Thomas Hayes joins us this morning Apple's down on this possible China probe the Europeans May retaliate against big Tech American big tech for tariffs imposed by Trump big picture question is Big Tech in trouble Tom well it's February stew buckle up buttercup and get your shopping list ready I think we've been suggesting to trim your magnificent 7 as a theme for 2025 and part of that is rooted in this in this trade issue but part of it is earnings growth has been decelerating going to decelerate from 33% last year to 21% this year but the multiples are still elevated and you're seeing all this capex you saw it with alphabet last night they took their capex estimates from 60 billion to 75 billion and they missed on cloud service Revenue so this is a lot of defensive spending we have yet to see the return on invested capital for all this capex so I think Mag 7 is take a little bit of a breather and you want to play that rotation theme that began in summer of last year let's take these two big stocks in turn first of all Apple uh are they now mixed up in Trump's dispute with China and if so uh are they going up or are they going down some more yeah I think US Stock Market exceptionalism has been tied to the mag 7 the concentration is a third I do think they're going to be Target number one not only for China but for the EU has put together this anti- coercive instrument they're readying if Trump levies tariffs they're going to hit back with that Apple has a monopoly with the App Store they get 30% Vig on every single app so that's going to be an easy target for some of these foreign governments as uh tariffs are Levy for sure Google is way down they're spending $75 billion in this year this financial year on AI do they need to spend so much money when China comes along with deep seek and does it much cheaper it's an existential threat and this is defensive spending I think you've got to lower your overweight to mag 7 I think you want to take advantage of some of the unmagnify because the the bottom line is go where the earnings growth is accelerating it's accelerating this year in the rest of the market last year was the mag s story lighten up just a little bit light you know if you're in IND sees you are overweight mag 7 you want to start to look at some of the cheaper stocks for 2025 for sure got it Tom Hayes thanks for joining us this morning big day thank you Tom now this demonstrators and we're back and then we're going to go into this presentation to the students at linta I think it's valuable number one understanding the difference between value and growth investing and the history behind that and then number two I got some really great life questions that I think many of you will find uh useful and valuable in terms of the kind of impromptu responses so we're going to listen in here so our principal from Harvard there you go they're all right currently accredited investors and qualified institutions accredited investors is people that have lots of money that's how that works okay he regularly appears on television such as netw Fox Yahoo business blomberg BBC and others he is regularly coed in the Wall Street Journal baren Financial Times reuter USA Today and US News and World Report his podcast video cast called hedge fun tips with Thomas a runs weekly and clips of it often appear in Mr Snider's stat of the day segments at the beginning of class um he's on X Instagram all that kind of stuff uh he lives in he just moved to to Huntington Beach so we're going to [Music] walk the [Music] of so this is awesome he loves to golf that's golf love golf okay sometimes he might miss work of golf okay let let's welcome Mr Thomas Hayes all right thank you wow well that is a very warm welcome it's it's wonderful to be here uh wonderful to be in Southern California we bought a house a couple months ago my daughters are very competitive water polo players swimmers anyone to hear swim no mostly just statistics in uh I into swimmer over there what's your stroke all right which one50 50 and 100 good for you awesome [Applause] um so I I grew up in New Jersey uh went to school in New York City we have houses in Connecticut and now we're residents of California so uh really honored to be here my wife came up with this crazy idea in September and I saidwell if we're going to live in Southern California we got to be able to see the beach from our house and we got to be able to walk to the beach from our house and uh we've been blessed to do that and and meet some wonderful people along the way so um I'm going to go through a presentation and I wish I had seen a presentation like this when I was your age because uh it could have probably sped up my career even more so than it has been uh I look a lot younger than I than I am and uh uh I won't correct you so uh I I go on Neil Cavuto are are you guys familiar with a TV station called Fox Business so there's a legendary broadcaster named Neil Cavuto and I'd go on his show as recent as a couple months ago before he retired and he would always say this young man is the smartest guy I've ever and I just said I don't correct Mr Neil Cavuto he's an absolute Legend but I'm not much of a Young Man um so we want to talk about the fundamentals of value investing and some of the edges that I've developed over the years um as cork was saying I run my own firm it's called great Hill Capital uh his AUM numbers he's projecting into the future we're not quite that big at this point but we're going to get there for sure uh the way things are going with performance and with uh everything we've been able to build prior to that are any of you old enough to remember the movie The Big Short it was with Brad Pit it chronicled the housing crisis so prior to going on my own I worked for one of the firms featured in that movie uh called Cornwall Capital they were one of the few who got the housing crisis correct made a tremendous amount of money on that trade and then before that the first fund I was at was a a fund called Bedford Oak advisers and the principal of that firm was a man named Harvey Eisen and he was friends with Warren Buffett for 40 years uh so I got to learn and cut my teeth in the value investing philosophy we would uh fly out on Mario gabelli's jet every single year and that was exciting for me I was you know late 20s early 30s going on a private jet to the birkshire hathway annual meeting as I like to say off to see the wizard the wonderful Wizard of Oz which was Warren Buffett and though those meetings and those uh Berkshire annual meetings really and the mentorship of Harvey uh laid the foundation of my investing philosophy uh and it completely changed my life and for a couple of you in this room today you're going to hear something or see something and you're going to say that makes perfect sense to me and then you're going to read a couple of books and you're going to get some experience and um you're going to wind up becoming very very successful investors and I will say uh it's a lifestyle second to none if you love it and you learn the few principles that will set you apart so our philosophy in a nutshell is kind of unpopular these days right now everyone wants to chase the shiny objects which crypto coin which inidia which uh uh trumpcoin Melania coin I mean there's all kinds of crazy things and that's a sign of froth in a market and the these are the type of areas often times you want to avoid and stick to basic principles we make our money buying on weakness and selling on strength what you're seeing in the marketplace right now uh due to recency bias is people are buying those things that are popular in the news today uh that are already up a lot hoping that someone comes in behind them and pays more for the asset even though the intrinsic value is not there um that will work until it doesn't and when it ends it ends badly uh our confidence to step in when others are bailing is root rooted in deep research and the premise that the more price becomes dislocated the more risk has been removed we're going to talk about a company today called VF Corp and VF Corp owns a few Brands you might be familiar with uh anyone wearing vans today anyone okay we've got huge opportunity for turnaround uh how many of you were wearing bands two three years ago okay all right so the trend hasn't come back to linta high school yet how about Northface okay pretty much everyone's wearing Northface how about Timberland okay we have our okay uh how about do you have a backpack Jansport East pack any you carry books around okay so VF Corp owns all that and the cool thing about investing is you can learn how to invest in things that you know and make a tremendous amount of money doing it particularly if you do it for other people as well uh over time so a lot of times when most Mar Market participants see volatility as increased risk we view it as increased opportunity okay when a stock is down a lot what do most people say about that stock don't invest in that stock it's risky right okay um however if you pick up a few skills that we're going to talk about here and you actually learn to see under the hood and see what the business is worth sometimes those dislocations in price are opportunities in a lifetime and what we try to do is we look for businesses that are marked down sometimes 60% 70% 80% that we can make two three four times our money in a few years uh of that stock would you guys be interested in making two three four times your money from time to time would that be valuable okay okay so it's interest did did the clap light go on or something because uh something you know I heard that this is a caffeine-free campus uh we might have to change that ladies and gentlemen I know you just had lunch um the philosophy of our firm and what I learned from Warren Buffett and from my first Mentor is great inv opportunities come around when excellent companies are surrounded by unusual circumstances that cause the stock to be stocks and I have no view on crypto uh either way I said to him uh let me ask you a question Terry if you put all your money into Bitcoin tonight and you walk up tomorrow and it was worth zero would you be surprised and he looked at me and he goes if I'm being honest probably not I wouldn't be I'd be disappointed but I wouldn't be surprised I said okay I said how about this Terry uh we're here close to an Anaheim California I said Disney stock price is down about 55% from its recent High 55% if you put 100% of your money into Disney stock down 55% and you walk up tomorrow and it was Zero would you be surprised and he said I would be shocked and I said well that's exactly how we manage risk so when you get an opportunity to buy a highquality asset like Disney okay does everyone love Disney here okay Anaheim California how many of you have been to Disney uh more than once raise your hand okay a lot more of you than than wear Vans that's for sure uh twice three times this is never going to change because the way it works is if you're a parent and I've got two daughters 10 years old and 12 years old and you don't take your children to Disney at least once Social Services comes to your house and they remove the children from the house and they say that you are not a fit parent you're abusing your child by not bringing them to Disney this is the American way it it's always been that way it's it's uh always going to be that way um but Disney has running cycles for many many years uh in 1984 the stock also fell over 55% the bass family which is a large wealthy oil family from Texas bought a controlling stake in Disney uh made about uh five times their money over 10 years made a few billion dollars doing that and the reason that Disney had fallen so much in the 80s is very similar to the reason it had fallen so much recently is they had to find a new way to sell their legacy IP Library their Content Library and back in 1984 they were transitioning to something called the VHS cassette no one here is going to know does anyone here know what a VHS cassette is oh my goodness okay okay so that's uh what do they call that retro guys okay so uh they figured out that they were to take the Content Library that had preceded for 20 years and put it on this device called a VHS tape stock was down they're like that's going to cost too much much money that won't be profitable sounds very similar to what the transition from DVDs to streaming and for the last few years Disney lost money streaming now they're starting to make money and the stock is going to double over the next few years again all this is opinion not advice thanks to uh thanks for putting that together Mr Snider uh so that's that now how many of you actually are uh interested in stocks and making money in the stock market quite a few of you okay how many of you have tried your hand at day trading okay how many of you prefer investing over day trading okay so I've Got the Right audience this is very good um so how does value investing work I mean the concept is very simp simp and what's easier said than done is to buy low sell high and investing with a margin of safety by purchasing stocks below their intrinsic value you know it's interesting with Disney for instance down 55% do you think their revenues fell 55% no okay did their cash flow is temporarily impaired because of the investment in streaming yes uh but on balance we see these normal cycles that repeat over and over when you buy long-term durable businesses that have lasted decades and you can buy them during these cyclical troughs and sell them when everyone gets excited in two three years you're going to remember this you'll be in college everyone will be like have you seen Disney's stock it's up like a 100% in the last few years should should I buy Disney stock my doorman will be coming to me in three years and be like you know Disney's now $250 should I buy Disney stock I'm going to say no we had that conversation like three years ago you should have bought it then let's talk about something else that's that's down a lot um so we seek high quality companies that are temporarily out of favor uh some things that are down a lot deserve to be down and may be going out of business and your job as an investor is going to be to figure out which ones are quality businesses that are temporarily impaired and which ones are actually permanently impaired maybe they've been disrupted maybe they don't have a competitive moat maybe their technology is no longer relevant which is why we tend to avoid most technology stocks we learned that from Buffett because you can get disrupted in a heartbeat because the barrier to entry is very low um and then this strategy when you're buying stocks with low and I and I'm going to emphasize this word normalized price to earnings ratios normalized Price to Book price to cash flow uh good I saved that don't know where that went um this favors reversion to the mean okay and how many of you know what reversion to the mean is any statistics who wants to throw out a a broad definition for us how about you yeah yeah that's that's absolutely right give him a hand by the way the company that owns Vans and Timberland and North Face how long do you think they've been in business any idea any guesses when do you think they started1 1899 here's a smart guy right in the front row so they've been around for 120 years trading in and out of different portfolio Brands that's the type of durable business that over time if you can buy it you know it was down 88% after the last cycle why because they loaded the Channel with Vans all of you probably have two three pairs of vans in your in your closet from three years ago that's all getting worked through and then the next cycle will come back and your probably your younger brothers and sisters are are buying what the new school Vans which have the puffy thing on the side and they'll come back and it'll be another thing um growth investing varies from value and investing and that growth is more chasing the shiny objects betting on the future trying to predict the future uh I can tell you that I've been around for a while and I've seen a lot of money made and a lot of money lost there are a lot more people certainly if you look at the Forbes 400 list there's only one guy on that list who has made it as a growth investor uh but there are probably a couple dozen value investors on the Forbes 400 and for those of you who think musk is the wealthiest guy in the world he is uh and he's absolutely changed the world but Buffett I mean I know he's only worth 150 billion uh but what people forget is he already gave away half of his wealth to charity so if you add that back uh Buffett's done pretty well following a simple strategy buying things like Coca-Cola company uh buying things like uh American Express buying durable businesses that last through Cycles so growth you're chasing the nvidias of the world if you remember June 20th there was a picture of uh how we doing on time cor 45 minutes okay so um June 20th there was a picture of Jensen Wong signing for the whole thing including Q&A okay uh signing someone's uh I don't know the right way to say it bikini top let's just put it that way like he was a rock star like he had that level of fandom and that level of euphoria and the minute I saw that level of excitement I put out an article on my website hedone tips.com which said the next pain trade okay and I didn't get the timing right it went from 140 to 153 and then I went on Stuart Varney's show on Fox Business and I said uh there's a story called there's there's a story of Icarus Icarus flew too close to the Sun and what happened to the wings the wings started to melt and I said the good news is uh his wings haven't started to melt yet the bad news is competition is coming and we're starting to see that and what happened in the past week with AI deep seek competition's coming they can generate similar type of models similar type of returns with much uh more inferior chips and that's just the beginning which is going to be good for Humanity it's it's probably going to be a little bit of a headwind for NVIDIA and Nvidia was pricing in great things Nvidia will do great things but price is what you pay values what you get so what we try to do is distinguish facts from reality so right now everyone thinks if I can just pick the next Tesla if I can pick the next Nvidia if I can pick the next uh Etc uh I will do better than everyone else if you go back to 1927 value has outperformed growth the strategy of buying low and selling High versus buying high and selling Higher by 4.5% per year for over a hundred years only in the last 10 years has growth outperformed value and part of that was a function of zero interest rate policy from the FED which is no longer going to persist we're moving to a more normalized rate environment so unless you believe rates are going back down to zero you want to look at the long-term data which favors and write this down if you remember nothing from that tall guy who came to your high school class five years ago when you buy high quality assets at good prices good things tend to happen if that's all you remember from Tom Hayes for the rest of your life by High quality assets at good prices good things will happen over time that is the most important message and this proves it so let's say you set aside a certain amount of money every single month like you hear about to retire you put it in the S&P 500 all this means the 4 and a half% a year doesn't sound like much what it means in real terms is over that time period your money would have doubled four times more if you were invested in value than if you were invested in growth okay so instead of getting to two you would have got to four to 8 to 16 to 32 You' probably have 32 million more if you just pick the right strategy over the long term uh than if you were chasing the shiny objects and getting hit by buses when when the fever breaks uh when we're buying things down I'll cover a couple of things here uh we tried to do solvency risk analysis so key thing is you know we did a simple example about Disney and VF Corp are they going out of business because if it stock's down 80% there are people in the market that think that company is going out of business so you have to look at the balance sheet you have to look at their cash flows you have to look at their revenues and once you can get confidence they're not going out of business and they have Runway then you start to look does the business have a moat does it have a competitive Advantage uh how's management in the case of VF Corp they got a new manager named Daryl Bracken okay Daryl previous pre previously ran a company called Logitech are you guys familiar with or Logitech do you guys any gamers in the room okay Logitech makes this little simple thing called a mouse and they make this other thing called a camera are there any other companies be besides Logitech that you can buy a mouse or camera from it's like unlimited right it's a commodity product but Bracken is a special manager Bracken came in as the manager of Logitech the CEO when the stock was 80 down 82% in 2013 over the next seven years he turned the company out around the stock went up 26 times now Logitech was not curing cancer okay what they were doing was selling little plastic mouses that anyone could manufacture in China they were they were they had these little cameras but due to his management his positioning Etc if you had invested $100,000 that would have turned into 2.6 million in about seven years is that pretty impressive so when he came into VF Corp and the stock was down 88% down from some $90 down to 13 12 $11 we got extremely interested in VF cour because number one we had done the solvency analysis we've done the mode analysis we we done the uh we had the management Catalyst and then near-term Catalyst was Brack and Daryl taking over uh our basis was $15 in change it's it got up to $27 recently and it's just getting started so we'll probably make three or four bags on that three or four times over time and that's all we do rinse and repeat um two things that give us an advantage over our competitors number one time Horizon we we take it a long-term view uh our average holding period is one to five years I know that's not fancy nowadays it's h one to five minutes if you follow Tik Tok uh they want you in in the afternoon with zero day options and out by 4M uh that gambling sooner or later always catches up uh there will be one out of a few million that Mak some money but they always give it back to the casino so just you know have patience you'll see what see how that works and and then the temperament is the ability to drown out noise a gentleman asked me earlier today like don't you watch your portfolio you've got tariffs today and all that stuff and the answer is I know the price that we're getting out of a company before we even get into a company because I've looked under the hood and done the fundamental analysis and we're going to talk about some things to take advantage of that um we we started to cover VF Corp I wanted to cover a few names with you here um that's Brack and Daryl by the way and he did a couple of things straight out of the gate number one is he took bankruptcy risk or solvency risk off the table the minute he came in and he sold off the Supreme brand okay is a supreme Grand going up or going down down okay so he sold it for 1.5 billion he sold it to pay off debt and now there solvency risk is no longer off the table he can focus on turning around Vans which is improving sequentially the Improvement starts in Europe it starts in Asia and then eventually it'll get to the US watch uh within one to one and a half years I'll bet when I ask who's wearing Vans probably a third of this room is going to raise their hands again it's going to be like 2000 when did you all own Vans 2021 2020 is that basically when they were hot yeah 1982 that's a durable brand yeah yeah and they still got the building there on the highway I see when I drive the girls to Irvine to swim um so that's a big thing uh North Face is a no-brainer everyone wears North Face it's huge in Asia and by the way they're going to benefit immensely from the turnaround in Asia okay as China comes back which is starting to a lot of stimulus over the past uh two years in fits and starts and now it's all starting to come together um so we think this can you know short-term conservatively probably move up from you know it's moved up from 15 or 13 to uh 27 we think it goes to 40 and then from there we'll look and see how the execution is what the fundamentals look like but I was listening to Bracken after last week's earnings and uh I think he's going to run this thing back up to new highs and it's going to take a few years and he's going to build an incredible franchise and he's an incredible leader uh second one Alibaba has anyone ever heard of this company oh a lot of you okay good so uh Alibaba is basically the Amazon of China and the most important thing you need to know about this because we're going to want to open for what about 30 minutes for questions is that yeah okay great great what do you guys like lectures or questions questions okay good so so lecture questions all right hands up if you like questions hands up if you like lectures and the rest of you are probably in the lecture Camp because you're sleeping now kidding all right so this is a perfect example of prices what you pay values what you get so during The covid Surge the stock hit uh just over $320 per share and postco it dropped down to about $58 a share okay so more than you know how much of a drop is that all the math wizzes in here 320 down to 58 you can ballpark it if you want all [Music] right all right let's call it over 80% we love we love the 80 round number um so it's like why would the price drop 80% I mean if you saw this stock price if you saw this stock chart and someone Saidi got a great stock for you and you looked at the chart what would you say to them I mean the thing is Fallen it looks like it's gone out of business is that correct okay you think most people if you walk down the street and show them this chart would say yeah that's a stock I want to buy no okay so let's talk about what's happened in terms of financials over that time period if you look back the company ipoed in 2014 back at around these prices it was around $88 so that's all the way on the left side of the chart as you guys are looking at it since then price is basically around the same it's it started to rebound off the bottom it's up about it's around $100 now but it's basically trading for the same price as it did 10 years ago the difference is revenues are up close to now 10x or a th% earnings in cash flow are up about 6X or 600% so you're getting 600% more free cash flow and all that really means is money left to you as the owner of the business because if you own one share of a company you are an owner of the business um for the same price and these type of divergences between intrinsic value and price are where fortunes are made there's no other sure way in my view uh candidly to make insane amounts of money than buying high quality assets when they're temporarily out of favor there's there's nothing like it like if if you were to walk into the board of this company and say I will buy the entire company at the price that it is quoted in the public markets today I'm financed by JP Morgan and I'll put up some equity on my own uh will you sell me the company they would call security and have you removed from the building because they would think you were absolutely lost your mind they would think you're crazy and yet every single day in the public markets prices react so extreme to the short-term headlines to the short-term noise to the short-term fashion show okay like certain clothes go in favor out of favor certain stocks go in favor and out of favor unrelated to the underlying fundamental so if you don't wear vans today forget about the fashion because no influencers are are ramped up yet we'll get the influencers going it's going to happen in about 12 months uh do you think the quality of the van's product is good like when you wear it is it durable does it or is it garbage and it falls apart it's durable right it's a good quality thing it's a reasonable price it's just temporarily out of favor that's that's what the sneaker is it's the same thing that's happening with the stock and then all the sudden you're going to see in nine months 12 months uh my girls are 10 and 12 let's see Sabrina Carpenter is going to put on a pair of Vans and half of this room is gonna buy a pair of Vans she won a Grammy last night right that you guys watch the you guys only do statistics up here all right good stuff all right so Alibaba is basically the Amazon of China and and it's effectively an AI ETF in China so if you want to own a piece of every single AI startup in China you want to own Alibaba why because they give startups compute power they give them cloud services for free tokens in exchange for equity in their company and most people aren't aware of this so it's not priced yet into the stock but when you uh see things like uh quen 2. their model actually beat deep seek they put out the data last week that's why the stock is up that's why it's just getting started so uh any of you play poker yeah so a lot of you good so in poker there's something known as out okay and in Alibaba we have a lot of outs number one it's the number one cloud provider in China number two it's the number one retailer to the middle class so in the last two years when the economy was down who did well the companies like Teemu selling the cheap junk that no one really cares you buy it all and then you never use it and you put it under your bed um Alibaba caters to the middle class and the upper class the higher-end luxury brands are all on alibaba's platforms uh you have tbow you have t-all international businesses growing 30 40% uh like a weed and their AI model is faster than open AI it's faster than deep seek and it's just beginning and you can buy it at five six seven times earnings which it's uh historic normalized multiple is like 25 to 30 times when it gets back into the fashion show and people get excited and Sabrina Carpenter starts wearing Vans and all that stuff so that's these are the type of things so this one um it's trading at about $220 billion market cap it's got 7080 billion dollar of cash and five six seven times earnings that doesn't exist you compare that to something like Nvidia is trading at uh 50 times earnings so price is what you pay values what you get you can pay a lower multiple for more earnings with something like Alibaba or you can chase the shiny object and get your face ripped out like uh nvidia's down 24% in the last few weeks since deep sea um couple tips anyone looking to get into the investment business hedge fund World okay about 10 20 of you okay so I would say a couple of things um NBA can help I think CFA is more important if that's what if that's the route you want to go um I think certainly statistics background is useful you got to have math you got to have accounting Finance economics we've got basically all those teachers in here um and for me I would say part of the reason that I'm here doing this speech is because a guy named Warren Buffett was generous enough to share his ideas uh and uh if if he wasn't so generous with the population and sharing his ideas is I wouldn't have a career and I've been able to build an amazing life uh for my family for myself for my clients as a result of the principles that he taught and the principles that he learned from a gentleman named Ben Graham who wrote the book The intelligent investor and my best suggestion to everyone in this room is read the book The intelligent investor by Benjamin Graham and one of two things is going to happen either one a light bulb is going to go off and it's going to change your life and you're going to go on to become an incredible investor over time make all your dreams come true or number two you're going to say I don't really understand what that Ben Graham was talking about in 1923 or whenever he wrote the book I'm not interested and then you're going to go off and become an entrepreneur and create things that are going to change the world um and uh either way is a great path I I very grateful for the path that I got into partially by accident and I hope that makes a difference but I think uh that's one way to kind of get some education if what you read in that book set a light off I would suggest you read every single annual letter Warren Buffett has written since he started managing money in the 50s and those lessons and I've done that um will absolutely almost guarantee that you will be a successful investor over time uh because no one does it you'd be amazed the amount of money that's managed by people that don't know basic fundamentals and basic principles that uh Ben Graham started Warren Buffett uh implemented and uh few I mean there's probably couple hundred people around the world that Implement those principles well and uh you know who they are uh by their results so with that said let's open it up for some Q&A okay have a question come on down okay over here okay here we go this will be good I'm a little nervous yeah yeah yeah I think that's a great question by the way give her a hand um I think the number one thing you can do at any age if you're just getting started investing is decide every single month that you're going to pay yourself first and you're going to set aside uh you know whatever it is200 $400 $500 a month and buy the S&P index Index Fund or the vti Vanguard all Market ETF low cost it'll give you exposure to the top 500 stocks and just do it every month because when when the Market's High you will buy less shares automatically when the Market's low you will buy more shares because it's the same amount of money and that will compound over time and then that gives you the runway and the security of savings where you can start to learn about individual stocks and maybe start to outperform over time as you enjoy that but that's probably the best advice I would give uh although it's all opinion not advice how much money do you make uh I will say uh I I will say first off it's a reasonable question it's the wrong question how no so the right question is how much are you worth okay so how many of you have read the book Rich Dad Poor Dad by ro Robert kosaki okay that's a life-changing book that's that's a book that you all need to read Because I grew up poor like lower middle class when I was 10 years old I was I had a paper route you don't even know what that means but you like delivered these physical things called newspapers to people's doors and asked them for money uh I was a dishwasher from 11 to 12 I was a golf caddy from 12 to 17 and when you grow up poor the only thing you think about is uh how much money can I make so I can buy some piece of bling or this or that once you get rich and you uh have done that then all you think about is what assets can I buy that generate more cash that continue to build more wealth etc etc etc so you're thinking less about ordinary income and you're thinking more about Investments That generate cash that can pay for everything that you want over time so uh I'll I'll leave it at this um it's beyond anything I could have possibly ever imagined uh I didn't plan it uh I was always ambitious I was always willing to do the work but um I think the best answer is I make 75% less than my than than my clients make because in order for me to get paid I got they've got to make money and the way my business is set up is if they don't make money in a given year how much do you think I make zero we have no management fee zero only performance fee uh and we set it up that way because we simply copied what Warren Buffett did when he was managing outside money uh we don't believe we should get paid for watching people's money we believe we should get paid for results and once you think about how much value can I deliver to other people you will get more money than you could ever possibly imagine uh so whoever asked that question and it's and it's a good question and um and the other thing is you'll get to a point when you don't have to work anymore um then it's one it's about Freedom two it's about making a contribution and three if you're an athlete it's honestly about competing and winning like there's there's a real joy in doing the best work you are humanly capable of and I hope you maybe have that a little bit in your school studies right now it's not just like I got to get good grades to get a good job to make my parents happy it's like no let me see what is the best I can possibly do given the genetic Lottery that you won to be here in beautiful Southern California I mean you could have been born in Bangladesh with no food and no water right instead you got Bor somehow you were born in sunny beautiful California in America with a beautiful school with teachers that care about you enough to call this guy for three months to say come speak to my students uh we don't realize how lucky we have it to be born where we are and have the opportunity so um a lot all right go uh first thing is statman of course I follow statman who doesn't follow statman everyone follows that what was the second question was one and what do you you think about is Tik Tok I'm I'm still trying to understand lessons uh you know one of these days I'm going to understand statistics so well I can really make some money but for now I I'm learning every single week I listen to his lesson so next question um how big is your house which one [Music] you said you didn't come from a um what you lack in capital you can make up in labor so what I decided at 10 years old I was just going to outwork everyone around me I mean the one thing that my parents did right and they did many things right was believed in education and uh they pushed me to go school even though I didn't want to but everything that I wanted to do for myself I had to earn and I would just Embrace work uh I I think being a golf caddy was the best thing that ever happened to me because I realized that a very young age I never ever want to have to do manual labor I want to get paid for my mind and I learned that at a very young age and a lot of people Coast through the cool kids in school and all that stuff and the uh you'll be shocked all the people that uh you think are going to be the stars of of real life that are the stars right now are going to be working for you so when when you know when people are tough on you and Etc just use it as motivation to work harder become better pursue your dreams and no matter how many times you get kicked in the face and you fall down get back up one more time good [Applause] question can you explain the differ between momentum investing and turn around investing what's the second one turn around investing yeah that's a great question uh you tried to cover it a little bit so momentum is kind of chasing things where the price has gone up a lot not necessarily grounded in fundamentals often times you know high price of sales multiple earning little to no money but everyone thinks it's going to be the next big thing by the way amazon.com in 2000 um was trading similar to like how in Nvidia was today everything that people thought Amazon was going to do it actually did the problem was in 2000 you were already paying the price for what would happen eventually 15 years later you know on and app stuff comes to your house the next day or if you're downtown huntingt and Beach it comes to you that day or in like an hour it's crazy uh the cloud computing all those things so what happened the stock ran up because all these great things were going to be happening everyone was right all the great things happened from Amazon everything we thought they could do they did and more the difference was they got too excited too early the stock fell 92% from 2000 to 2003 even though the fundamentals of the business were improving very similar to what's happening with Alibaba now before they recovered and went on to do great things so uh you can be right about the narrative but if you pay too much for an asset you're going to get hurt and uh so what we try to do is take the opposite side invert like Charlie Munger says and say well if that's gonna if that's what's going to hurt you the most in business what's going to help you the most is buying a great quality asset when no one wants it and then riding it back up and that's that's what we try to do and play the mean revers over time great question what was the biggest in your career when youer biggest what a biggest break in your career oh biggest break uh probably meeting well I think the biggest break in my life was uh probably uh marrying the right woman yeah yeah cuz um that's that's probably the most important decision you'll make in your life by the way because I was willing to take risk and she was never like oh if we do that what if we lose this what if we lose that she was always like try it we'll figure it out try it we'll figure it out so I never had that like nagging like what if this what if that she was always just willing to be like let's let's go for it and I think that's number one pick the right partner uh I would say my first hedge fund boss was you know taking me into that value Mafia World bringing me around to the meetings the hedge fund lunches with Lee cooperman and Mario gabelli and the annual meetings with Warren Buffett that was lifechanging and kind of just learning by immersion he never really sat me down and said learn this learn I I learned by immersion and I had to self-generate the motivation because he was already very wealthy he didn't have the motivation to train an analyst and and everything else so I think that was a break I would say the other advice I would give that took me longer to learn was you know hard work uh and effort and persistence that's kind of and smarts that's kind of table Stakes if you want to perform at the highest levels the quantum leaps if I have to look back uh happen in the Social Circle and that's hard to understand so two things I would say about the Social Circle Number One is hang around with people who are better than you if you want to be a better golfer play with better golfers if you want to be smarter hang around with the smartest kids if you want to be faster swim with the fast I mean I'm in here in California because this is the best water polo in the world and my girls are serious about water polo and swimming so this is where they need to be they got to be around the fastest people because being number one in you know wherever that doesn't matter is not going to help them so I think you have to I'm I'm not social by Nature I once I realized that all the quantum leaps in my life came as a function of Social Circle um I forced myself to be in situations around people who are smarter than I am fast better golfers than I am wealthier than I am not not to climb it's just to become the best you can possibly be in whatever you're up to if you want to become a fashion designer don't hang around with people that have no fashion sense you know that that's really what it comes down to uh if you want to be a a fast track star run with the fastest kids so you feel like you're slow don't run with the slowest kids so you feel like you're a champion because you'll never get better that way [Applause] yeah that's hard uh I would say you know econ is a good major business undergradu is a good major um if you're going to go to Business School school I would go to if you want to get into this I'd either go to if you can get into Columbia or if you can get into Wharton for business school if you want to be an investor those are probably good places but honestly if you the CFA uh designation you can study on your own you probably have the books in your library and if you don't you can get them at the public library start to study for the CFA and educate yourself formal education will make you a living self-education will make you a fortune any anyone who's achieved things that you think you want in life uh they're exceptional yes they know the basics that you all learned in college but they developed an edge or a method or a way of doing things from experience and from selfstudy from self-learning on top of the basic learning that really push him ahead so yeah I've seen it I've seen everything you know it could be it could be English it could be history you learn how to write and communicate and then you take the CFA on the side and you develop skills and that type of thing but I would say accounting is the language of numbers very important I know there's an accounting teacher in the back uh econ business all fine have some statistics courses and that type of thing yeah thank you we got probably time for about one or two more okay how do you use AI your job good question um it's it's currently not at the level I wanted it when I ask it the questions I want it to answer uh but it will be and I'll use it more and more I mean for me the number one thing is I'm not interested in secondhand interpretations of analysis on the assets I'm looking at I want Source materials I want public company materials and I draw my own conclusions um and some of that comes from experience simple answer I need to get better uh second simple answer is so does the technology but yeah I'm going to explore that with you I mean right there tells you why the playing field is leveling and if you can Master some of these things you can disrupt uh things that have been in place for many many years so get after it you you'll do great okay last question um what Ro have relationship yeah this I learned later in life I think it's probably the most important thing you can do other than table Stakes learn the skills um and invest so I would spend a lot of time doing that and do it with people who make you grow and people who want to see you succeed and people who push you to be better and if you if you're focused on that I think the guy's the limit so yeah great question okay I want to thank a couple people Mr Gold Jennifer back there and Company back there thank you very much Mr and of course Mr thank you and we're back on to the data we've got a lot to cover this week uh first and foremost let's kick it off with this chart this is not really what you see at Market tops even though we are in February and February is the second weakest month of the year so just keep an eye on that the the global policy rate Cuts easing cycle has peaked at 62 Cuts last year uh that is now going down but that doesn't mean that bad things happen to the market if anything that means that thing good things start to happen last time few times it peaked April 2009 May of 2000 those were really generational buys automotive sales volume again beat the last two years in j January down from December that happens every single year so that was good to see European stocks still trade at a much lower earnings multiple than their us peers people looking at this chart would say well that's the way it's always been but if you go back 30 years you will see that it International and US exceptionalism runs in normal cyclical Peaks and troughs just like value and growth and this time will be no different Trump's tariff plans would bring rates to highest in decades so if all of the US Mexico and Canada kick in it would take us back to not holy Smoot levels but those levels in early 2020 uh excuse me those levels in early like 1920 and then you had another eight years of robust economic growth until Holly Smoot uh at the end of the 20s early 30s which most people attribute to the Great Depression but we were raising tariffs for 12 years beforehand and had a period of excess Prosperity so I don't think all of these will hold so therefore I don't even think we're going up to the levels that preceded a decade of prosperity but uh we know which direction we are going is up off of historically um many Century low levels European Banks and secular bull this is interesting that shows some of the value trade in Europe starting to take off European value stocks outperforming growth stocks um us uh Europe growth versus value rolling over uh this tends to you know that's interesting because they rolled over in the same way in 20201 ahead of us growth uh rolling over value we've been talking about this for a long time it's now starting to move toward a consensus point of view we and the listeners here were ahead of the Curve on that new orders inventories pointing to upside in global pmis manufacturing recovery we talked about with Stu exceptional us growth driven by exceptional government spending that is going down ladies and gentlemen if you haven't been paying attention to Doge follow Elon Musk on X and you can see example after example of egregious um waste of taxpayers dollars it's it's uh it's really disgusting what what had been going on and it's good that it's getting cleaned up it's going to be good for Bon yields it's going to be good for the country uh it's it's going to be good all around meanwhile intelligent bull investor bull bear ratio remained relatively low bullish for stocks that's from yard Denny your investment ah this is funny this is in a meeting between Jeff Bezos and Warren Buffett Jeff Bezos asked Warren Buffett your investment thesis is so simple you're one of the richest guys in the world and it's so simple why doesn't everyone just copy you and barn Buffett responds quote because no one wants to get rich slowly and um so there you go and there are a few of us that are that have copied and added our own twist and everything else and as you can tell Works quite well uh a positive January is a good thing for 20124 this is from Dietrich over at Carson uh negative January is tend to end up negative for the year with a negative 1.8 positive January the average tends to be 16.8% going all the way back to 1950 we're not that optimistic we think AG at 12 this year but you know we'll take it uh if it comes I think flows here this is showing flow of funds that tends to peek out mid mid-February the last two weeks of February tends to be bumpy so buckle up buttercup uh moving on economic policy uncertainty has soared so that's what you see when in 2001 which we continue to reference as a good great analog for a lot of the things that we're doing and then in May 2020 which was just an unbelievable year for us so uh we love conditions like this this is uh makes a smile so wide we could eat a banana sideways earnings growth as a friendly Public Service Announcement ladies and gentlemen go where the earnings growth is and uh accelerating and that is where small cap dramatically more that followed by midcap followed by large cap the exact opposite of what's happened last year when mag 7 outperformed now Val value uh small cap midcap International is going to is already and will continue to outperform uh Industrials even better when PMI is less than 50 and Rising this is from fun Strat uh and this is the condition that we're in right now and shows how Industrials outperform these are the month return stats as you can see February is the second worst month of the year behind September and tends to be excessively weak uh early February like this week and then uh end of the month also here is TLT treasury bonds we've been saying bonds will get bid in 2025 that's already started to happen and you can see all the dumb money piled into short interest which is what they do at every single bottom right before big Bond rallies crowded trades a theme of what we like to cover uh this is the Goldman Sachs manufacturing survey tracker preds manufacturing ISM coming out of a 2year depression in manufacturing this is going to be a critical theme uh median 2E S&P 500 since 1950 as you can see here the second half of February second half of June second half of September uh tends to be ter and the first half tends to be okay in February so that is what it is um don't be surprised if indices are bad and many stocks we own are good I know that continues to be a contradiction but it continues to happen in real time uh January was phenomenal and I think we're going to see more of the same throughout the year people in passive uh overweight mag 7 without knowing it by owning the indices are going to be unhappy and people who have done work and bought great businesses that were marked down are going to be generationally happy uh and that's exciting so us share of global indices has risen recently but the earnings has not R risen commensurate to that and what happens like you saw in 2000 when it gets too far ahead and the earnings growth lags it catches up and that's going to be all the mag 7 coming back down to reality when everyone realizes the emperor has no close and all the cap backs has led to negative return on invested capital and decelerated earnings growth uh that's the bad news the good news is all the Miracles that we expect AI is going to do uh are going to happen they're going to one take a little longer than everyone expects and number two um you're already paying for all those Miracles that you expect so price is what you pay value what you get the good news is it's got to happen the bad news is you already paid for it and uh and that's why they're coming in and people are surprised until they're not corporate sentiment hits record highs Dow Jones 10year cycle as you could see on an average years that end in five tend to be one of the best years of the decade we'll see if that holds true this time as well uh this is interesting about the prices of goods the Tariff premium uh US states imposed tariffs on washing machines from February 2018 to 23 here's how it affected prices compared with overall inflation and appliances as a whole so they did initially uh they went up then they went down and on balance they have underperformed overall inflation and O and in line with overall appliances what they're saying is in the short term it's inflationary in the intermediate to long term it actually has no difference strong BuyBacks despite elevated rates in valuations uh growth is lagging value by 3 percentage points year to date that's good that's normal this is abnormal 19 uh 2015 to 2023 is abnormal if you look back through the rest of history and then go all the way back to 1927 value outperforms growth by 4.4% per year we are moving back into that regime uh number of companies expressed optim optimism and this is the reason for the broadening I continue to remind you and to Enlighten new viewers the reason is magnificent 7even earnings growth is decelerating dark blue unmagnify components of the S&P 500 earnings growth accelerating and you're paying half the multiple so price is what you pay value is what you get faster earnings growth for half the price that's where I want to be um covered this this is interesting the dollar Index is back to levels that killed tech stocks in 2000 I don't think this is a great chart but I do think it's worth noting and I'm not calling for this type of tech wreck that we saw in 2000 I am calling for an underperformance and we're already seeing it effectively since last July but certainly more pronounced in 2025 and I think this dollar is rolling over just like you saw in 2001 it will persist week which is going to help the small caps going to help the international going to help the value over growth as this dollar weekends and probably continue to create an environment where mag 7 will underperform February isn't a fan of postelection years negative 1.3% on average probably skewed towards the second half of the year here's from Seth golden the key to 2025 five in one all to relevant chart equal weighted S&P 500 versus cap weighted Tech triple bottom he's showing here in this box uh speaks to broadening rally projects Magnificent Seven dominance fading suggests small mid unprofitable Tech Rising equal weight and down cap tier out performance I.E small cap midcap and what he's leaving out there because it's not reflected in the chart is international outperformance and we continue to be in that camp uh jobless claims ticking up this uh we'll see what happens tomorrow but signs are pointing towards a weaker jobs report tomorrow in which case we would see a continued bid in 10-year bonds I.E yields compress uh Trump and Bessant said as much they're not really going to be on top of the FED to cut because he's out next year anyway they're going to focus on bringing down the 10-year yield and they're going to do so obviously by cutting expenses with Doge giving the market confidence that spending is under control uh maybe being in the market buying I don't I don't I don't think so but uh because that is the rate that controls mortgage rates and which controls the housing market which is why they want to focus on that and and obviously refinancing the government debt and that's a critical Factor revision suggests more moderate us payrolls growth so that we haven't seen a revision this large since Obama in 2009 um volatility is the toll we pay to invest this is a very important chart from Ryan Dietrich over at Carson uh since 1928 various declines per year on average you are going to get 7.23% dips every single year in the indices you are going to get 3.45% correction every single year every 1.1 years you are going to get a 10% correction intra year these are normal this is the toll we pay to invest and get outsize returns above inflation over time 15% severe correction one every half uh I'm sorry half of uh half of one every single year so every two years you're going to get a 15% correction on average and every 3.5 years you are going to get a 20% bare Market the good news is I think we pulled forward two of them since we had one in 20120 and we had a second one after the um technical recession in 2022 we had a 25% draw down so we had two of those in a period of three years basically two years um and you should get two of those every seven years so we pulled forward five years of 20% Corrections so you know something to keep in mind if you get too bearish on any given day here is Ryan Dietrich very strong January for stocks but be aware the first quarter of a postelection year usually isn't all that strong barely positive that's going back to 1950 so expect that volatility you could see a lot of those losses and volatility in the top seven stocks and even though the indices are down or flat seeing enormous great things happening with the UNM magnificent 493 and other groups we've been talking about and telling you to get position for or even better if you're a client positioning you for so a good start for 2025 could mean the bull continues average gain uh when you get a greater than 2% year-to-date return in January uh the final 11 months of the year on average tend to be up 8.1 I'm sorry 12.3% as opposed to the normal year of 8.1% uh and for the calendar year tends to be up 18.4% so we shall see extreme stress for the auto supply chain if tariffs last John Murphy estimates that auto prices would have to increase 33 00 on average to offset the proposed 25% tariffs uh imported from Canada would be more such prices would exacer the affordability challenges for the autoc consumer us typically Imports 78 light vehicles per year 4 million come from Canada and Mexico Etc so a lot of people have asked like is Cooper standard going to be hurt by this is Stanley Black and& Decker going to be hurt by this is Whirlpool going to be hurt by this yes yes and yes and yes it's probably mostly priced in at this point and the reason is is like people still need cars and washing machines and all this stuff all this is is a tax on the poor that's all inflation and price increases ever are so um you know it's it's like okay we're going to create an external Revenue Service and we're going to collect more money from tariffs so we can lower taxes okay okay great money is fungible so now what happens is the tariffs increase the cost of goods in the short term uh which is a tax on the poor and then you lower their taxes to offset it and make them think that they have uh lower taxes but in effect they have lower purchasing power which effectively is a wash so at the end of the day um there aren't many people signing up to manufacture Hammers and DeWalt chainsaws and uh uh ceing systems around the doors and the windows at $5 an hour in uh you know Detroit Michigan or Mississippi or any of those places so uh what's basically going to happen is it's going to be passed through to the customer and at a higher price because no one's going to set up shop and say oh Stanley is in trouble I'll just manufacture in the US and undercut them on price it's simply not going to happen even after the tariffs Stanley is still going to have have a competitive advantage and uh uh and the moat so all of this stuff is just noise to take you out of great companies that you own and many of you have fallen for it and I'm very sorry for you but we have used the opportunity to pick up some of those shares and we will continue to do so thank you very much uh this shows the US import many key goods from tariff hip Nations beer fruit vegetables distilled Spirits poultry I mean do you think people are going to not eat fruit and avocados and beer and vegetables because it's up an extra 25 cents at the end of the day they're going to eat what they're going to eat they can't get it anywhere else they're not going to get it cheaper no one's going to just stand up a plant in five minutes and say it's cheaper no tariff avocados it's just that's not the way it works uh top five imports from by value from Mexico vehicle parts that's just going to be across the board I think that's will be partially offset if the tariffs stay I mean at the end of the day Kevin hasset who's a member of the I think he's heading the National Economic Council under Trump came on and said this is different this is not a tariff War this is a drug war so as soon as the president of Mexico and Canada prime minister of Canada said we're going to send 10,000 troops to the border and stop fentol from coming in Trump backed off so I guess if they keep those troops there there's a decent chance that the uh tariffs will de be delayed for Canada and Mexico and the Chinese ones the market took it like a champ and uh uh and that's that I mean that that's really what it comes down to so select recent notes addressing tariffs on China Mexico and Canada more noise there this is interesting the a AI sentiment survey this turned somewhat bullish in my view because the retail investor got very bearish this week um maybe that comes down a little bit further but but um again this is not things you see really at tops you see it closer to Bottoms ISM Services was a little weaker than expected uh so servic is coming down goods coming back that's good for a lot of our positions 10-year government bond yield everyone said it was going to five we said nope not going to happen again just like we said back here and we're down to 442 headed much lower Japanese Yen starting to strin these are the things that we T to keep an eye on as the carry trade unwinds which means billions upon billions of free do free Yen that has been parked in mag 7 is coming out this is the story not deep seek it's the carry trade onwi and no one's paying attention to it and when you try to talk about it no one wants to hear about it so I don't talk about it but I just benefit from it uh Argentina vehicle sales year on year this is what happens when you get good government policy in place it turns around the country and and uh that's a positive thing for Latin American Auto Sales China's crude imports from the US elevated here so they basically put a tariff on themselves because they don't have any real natural resources of of size to sustain their population question is how much are they going to get from Russia uh and we'll see uh China's crude imports from Canada and Mexico so Canada has been the big beneficiary from this trade War as far as uh what looks like a continued Trend Canada will send uh China more money their their uh uh costs are a little bit higher because they have whatever it's called the dirtier harder to refine type stuff but anyway the point is uh and Mexico will be a small beneficiary of that as well International markets still trading at a discount to the US cheapest being emerging markets in China we're going to continue to take advantage of that here shows the uh data centers around the world 11,800 us has 5,400 of them China only has 449 so we've got a big lead there job openings coming down declined sharply in December to 7.6 million is probably in line with an expectation of a weaker jobs report tomorrow Japan wages grow by the most since 1997 helping boj rate path and Yen so yen is getting stronger rates are going up in Japan IE carry trade is unwinding mag 7 will continue to be Under Pressure so long as that Trend continues this time is different the Trump trade war in 2018 uh us represented 19% of China's total exports now it's down to 15% so doesn't hurt them as much they have less incentive to negotiate and they haven't they could basically destroy Apple in one Fell Swoop and it's already happening on its own their sales were down 11% they blamed it on not having uh uh AI which their AI product is crap right now it will get better but um preview of Coming Attractions and then they went after Google which has uh for an antitrust thing so they will take down and Europe will take down and all these guys will take down to the extent that Trump wants to do tariffs these bureaucratic bodies will just start to shake down the mag 7 for antitrust anti-monopoly and fines so that's how they will hit back we estimate that a 10 percentage Point increase in US tariffs on Chinese good would weigh on China's real GDP by 50 basis points so last year they did 5.4% GDP growth we did 2.5 according to this if these tariffs sustain they'll be down to you know 50 basis points less than estimates let's call it you know around 5% double our growth China's LNG imports from the US has uh accelerated and continues to accelerate so again these are not things that help uh drill baby drill so let's see if they get to a discussion I do think as much as Trump wants to see income from foreign tariffs I think he really wants to see an absolute um stop of any type of drugs fallowing across the border more than anything else and I think that's what ultimately he's going to get to save face book a huge win for the American people stopping the drug trade stopping the illegal immigration not getting much by way of tariffs but um and then uh in addition he will say okay we'll get rid of the tariffs but you're going to take a ton of our a you're going to take a ton of our LNG and most of them will say yes as they need it anyway so it's not in their interest to have tariffs on things that they need and um they will do that Google's revenue growth slows their cloud service missed expectations and their cap backs going from 60 to 75 billion with a negative return on invested Capital was not received as positive news anymore uh here is Morgan Stanley's estimates of the FED funds rate going down looks like about two cuts this year we agree with that then they're expecting another 100 basis points the year after we disagree that would imply a serious recession we do not think that is in the cards video is taking over over from text you can see YouTube continues to grow Tik Tok uh and the Facebooks and the Twitter's of the world are declining because they're not as focused on video Auto unit inventory level this is what I'm talking about when I say that yeah it may increase the cost uh if if he puts the tars back on which are now delayed may increase the cost of the car a few thousand bucks but the demand is still there and number one and number two the theme moving forward is going to be like houses it's going to be smaller cars as we've seen with the hybrids and uh the rav 4S and the Corollas and all that stuff versus the Escalades which was in 2020 uh and this has to get back up to a normalized level this is you know well below cash for clunker level before the last run so the man the demand here is just ramping up even if it's a few extra thousand bucks a car they'll just build smaller cheaper cars and yes that will hurt OEM margins it will not hurt as much the auto supplier margins to the same extent here's the North American SAR just like we saw January is always weak January is always weak January is always weak every single year January is always weak going all the way back January is always weak and then the back half of the year go goes the key is that it's going up year on year us trade balance with major Partners so you can see here uh in ch in 2016 which much bigger for China than it is now Euro Europe has a lot to lose with the trade War more than anyone else uh and same with Mexico and same with Canada you can see the top five Goods imported by value from Mexico vehicle parts trucks buses ET Etc special purpose Vehicles Canada is crude oil uh China is cell phones and computers analysts are slashing us earnings forecast we said this would be happening seasonally it happens this time of year every single year covered the record short interest in bonds the most crowded trade here's the 10day sum of the advanced decline ratio shows the health of the market the broadening of the market the greater participation here's consumer staples relative to the S&P 500 forward PE you haven't seen this low of a relative PE ratio for Staples uh than in 20120 and then going back to 2009 and then going back to 2001 I think there's going to be a lot of stuff happening as a matter of fact if you looked at the notes that we sent over for vanney on Wednesday we were going to pitch two defensive Staples uh or yield sensitive uh stocks that will benefit as bonds get bid and yields go lower that's Staples and that's reach so we had crown castle International and we had horel Foods the makers of spam Skippy uh all the type of protein foods you need to eat if you're on gp1s uh Apple Wood Bacon uh horl pepperoni Hormel chili uh spam okay all this incredible stuff so lot lot of Staples are going to get bid here no one's position for it that's going to be an opportunity equal weight to market cap weight this is another way of showing Seth Golden's chart here Tokyo food CPI year onye inflation is coming back in Earnest in Tokyo a lot of that related to input cost because they have no real natural resources and uh that's always been their problem along with demographics and population decline so this as this goes up the carry trade on wines which hurts mag 7 Tokyo inflation hits the fastest Pace in a year supporting bog Vu to continue hiking here's the bond yield this all this means is carry trade unwind mag seven pressure over and over our base case remains that data centers could drive 3 to four billion cubic feet per day of natural gas demand growth by 2030 we love it we love our com stock we still love our range resources and uh we'll continue to do so single stocks Trail the S&P 500 by the most since 1999 this was the period ladies and gentlemen to flip the switch where value dramatically outperformed growth for the next seven years International over uh domestic and small over large boom bus semiconductor cycle I wish this chart went back to 2000 but what it's showing here is the cycle is peaking for these highflying semiconductor stocks now starting to get smashed um world semiconductor sales year on-ear followed by Philadelphia Stock Exchange semiconductor index you can see that pointing down and that tends to follow quote we have got a lot of great quotes of the week so I want to cover these uh this is from Warren Buffett no matter how great the talent or effort some things just take time you can't produce a baby in one month by getting nine women pregnant okay and that's the that's the key with turnarounds once you do the solvent analysis you see they have the runway you know they have a durable moat then it's just a question of time before you get your doubles and triples and we play the time Arbitrage game that is one of our major edges long ago Ben Graham taught me that price is what you pay value is what you get whether we're talking about socks or stocks I like buying quality merchandise when it's marked down not crap from Teemu okay Benjamin Graham in the short run the market is a voting machine and I'm going to add based on on technicals based on price but in the long run it is a weighing machine based on fundamentals and underlying business growth and intrinsic value and then finally another classic from Charlie Munger a young man comes up to mosart and says with your help I want to compose Symphonies mosart looks at him a bit perplexed and says you're too young to be composing Symphonies the young man suddenly feels thrown off too young he quickly replies look you were doing Symphonies when you were 10 years of age well I'm 21 and mosart grins politely and says yes but I wasn't running around asking other people how to do it so there you go Charlie Monger classic uh on to the news of the week why Chinese Tech keeps surprising the West deep seek is the latest product from China to shock the US tech oligarch bro oligarchy uh and it won't be the last I think we did this to ourselves with the premature ideological sanctions we took a country that was dependent on us and now made them independent of us necessity is the mother of invention and we've unleashed the genie out of the bottle here so uh unintended consequence of bad ill-thought out knee-jerk policy not the first time won't be the last time alphabet tumbles as Cloud growth slows missing estimates we covered that UBS wealth reiterated it's 6600 Target for the S&P tariffs unlikely to be sustained us manufacturing activity expands for the first time since 2022 this is a theme we've been talking about for months we would be coming out of the manufacturing depression and we are destock to restock here we go baby clients are positioned for this and benefiting Dollar General is no Walmart by the stock anyway I kind of like this one I keep looking at it haven't done it because we've got enough uh low-end retail with Advanced Auto Parts which is making a nice move by the way uh this is interesting it's so funny how they changed the head lines after the fact if the stock price goes up they say uh Intel turnaround happening despite no finding not finding a new CEO now it says Intel falls on disappointing first quarter revenue forecast so uh you can't make this stuff up these people blow with the wind like a tree but nothing this is just dead money until they announce a new CEO and we can see what the plan is uh but at the end of the day it's so cheap we continue to like it we continue to add and uh we're comfortable with that position don't count on the Magnificent Seven stocks competing their winning streak this year's these Wall Street gurus warn the the thing I love about Intel is now as we're seeing with uh deep seek you can outperform or perform in line with the advanced chips if you can get the inference right and uh the model correct and what I love about Intel is it is the it is the leader of inferior chips so I think the future belongs to to them I think the superior chips are going to have the harder time as all these startups start clamoring for inferior chips and uh Intel is the name of the game don't count on the Magnificent Seven stocks repeating their winning streak this year says the these Wall Street gurus worn uh we agree with that we've been saying it for two months plus Trump tariffs risk 29,000 price rise in us home building costs so that's another factor that has to be considered and why that probably will be less inclined to reinstitute those tariffs provided the president follows through on her promise to keep 10,000 troops at the border and drugs and illegal immigration out of our country and I think that uh that will be a good quidd Pro quot China retaliates against us tariff Trump G phone call expected we'll see what happens Estee louder to cut up to 7,000 jobs in corporate overhaul these are normal things you see in a turnaround the key is the family owns 38% of the stock they'll fix it just like the Walmart family they've not been doing this for five years they've been doing this for decades and they will continue to do it this is just a play on the Emerging Market middle class growth which is just beginning Trudeau Benz KN Canada will send 10,000 troops to the Border Nam fent andol Zar to delay Trump tariffs Alibaba offers deep seek on cloud service after Microsoft Amazon and Huawei uh also we talked about last week how their quen 2.5 is faster on all counts faster than open AI faster than deep seek so that's why the stock is up my guess is it takes a rest in February it's had a huge move from 58 to 100 uh so if you can get it in the low 90s or mid 90s probably the last opportunity I wouldn't hold my breath but I think you might get a look in the mid 90s for sure uh Trump's 2.0 trade war is fundamentally different from 1.0 we covered the reasons why let's cover here what is this here are all the ways Trump tariffs could hit stocks so Goldman was out on Monday we covered it with Stu basically saying it would affect if if they stay which right now they haven't uh it would lead to a 3% drop in earnings a 5% drop in the S&P 500 that was your worst case so when you see some stocks down a lot more than that it's it's uh great the beauty of the Trump tariffs in CH is that the DI Minimus uh exemption that timu and Sheen have been using to ship goods under $800 into the US with no uh tariffs is now been closed and that you know people say well Alibaba has AliExpress but it's so small in comparison their growth is xus in Alibaba so what's beautiful is the cash machine from teu and Shen is now going to dry up up which is going to give Alibaba more relative strength uh in all the other areas which is which is great so I'm glad to see that uh on to the next PayPal earnings show refresh is working while the stock is dropping anyway and uh we covered that in the article this week we'll get to that in a second again sandbagger and chief Alex Chris is setting expectations low to absolutely crush it once again oh and by the way he said we're going to buy back $15 billion of stock uh and for those of you wondering what does that mean in English $15 billion of stock is about give or take 77 billion do so uh 20% of the company and the stock is down so you can't make this up this is beautiful opportunities um unfortunately our basis is much much lower than this so we're not buying a ton here but new money came in we'd probably start we'd probably include that as one of the new positions uh say goodbye to teamu we covered that Alibaba stock is a winner we covered that that's coming out of Barons now it's not coming from the lady who was the China Basher for the last three years uh it's coming out of new people who have taken over the beat strategist who coined the Magnificent 7 warns us Tech is set to lag that is from Michael hartnet one of the best strategist on the cell side for sure moving along sandbagger in the mouse stock market and sentiment results we covered this stuff uh the names we were going to cover that didn't have time was horel with a 3.7% yield and crown castle with a 7% yield we love that here was a picture with the full Auditorium and Estee louder look this is a kitchen sink quarter with the new CEO Stephanie de la favier and this one we like and want to build more it's a relatively small position we're hoping to make it a bigger position over the next few months uh the next one was PayPal thing I like here you can read through all of this is um I like what Jeff did here he says sandbag guidance ever since Alex Chris has shocked the world CNBC interview he seems to have figured out that the secret to happiness both on Wall Street and in life is low expectations here's what he originally guided for fiscal year 2024 uh non-gaap EPS of 383 free cash flow of 5 billion and share repe purchases of at least 5 billion here's what the team actually delivered non-gaap EPS of 465 so he did 21% better than he promised free cash flow of 6.6 billion which was 32% better than he promised in 2024 and share repurchases of 6 billion 20% more than he promised so he under promised he overd delivered taken to the extreme once again Alex appear Chris appears to be using the same strategy for fiscal year 2025 after seeing just how well it worked in 2024 the company is guiding for non-gaap EPS of 495 to 510 free cash flow of 6 to7 billion and a share repurchase of 6 billion but if we see similar upside to priz to last year when PayPal was still in transition phase whereas 2025 is about Partnerships and scaling product adoption EPS could Land north of $6 free cash flow around 8 billion and BuyBacks reaching 7.2 billion history doesn't repeat but it often Rhymes uh love that analysis and I think that's the key way to think about PayPal moving forward Disney doing great you can see here free cash flow price is lagging free cash flow recovery that's going to continue price is going to continue to climb and we'll wind up with our double from much lower levels than here out uh you know two years out and that will meet our IR our hurdles and what we like to see happen in our turnaround Tom special so you can go through all the highlighted points from the conference call and every all the other work that we do internally if you are serious about your positions all of this is opinion not advice go to hedge fund tips.com click on terms we deal exclusively with qu qualified clients and institutions uh and sophisticated investors etc etc Etc uh so we covered that and then finally Stanley Black and& Decker same story everyone nervous about the tariffs completely unfounded and uh will prove to be an incredible generational buy opportunity for a durable moat that has been around for decades and decades the type of businesses we like to buy fear down to 39 on the fear and greed index not what you see near top same thing with National Association of active investment managers puked out of their stocks last week so uh that's that Arc the Kathy Wood ETF top 30 weights earnings estimates are up 2.2% in the last 60 days oil and gas equipment and services uh ETF uh earnings power was revised down almost 10% for the top 30 weights in the last 60 days so we've not been in a rush on the servicers we think a few of them are getting cheap but we're just comfortable with our com stock EXP exposure for energy for the time being but we'll keep our eye on a few of the servicers estimates came down from 275 to 27363 that's what happens this time of year and we've covered earnings growth by sector so with that said let's get on to the ask me anything questions those of you who enjoy that and get value from viewer questions stick around those of you who just like the podcast thanks for tuning in we'll be back next week and here we go for for question number one is coming from Kyle M uh could you explain please explain how blackout periods work for corporate share repurchase programs usually you have to wait uh 3 days or so after uh information is publicly disseminated he's asking as it relates to PayPal and to Goose um at the end of the day who cares if they do it in 3 days or 30 days if they're if they can buy in 20% of the company uh in the case of PayPal or 10% the company in the case of goose you want it at lower prices not you know Panic knee jerking elf down 75% from high still growth trading under 20 forward multiple for 30% growth looks pretty attractive here in the 60s we've covered this a few times I think I've said no a few times and been right let's see if anything has changed I mean these are the traps that people forget so here is a 40 bagger that just because it's down 100% they got recency biased they say oh 5 minutes ago it was 200 now it's only 100 what these broken momentum stocks they tend to go back to where they started uh I'm not saying that's necessarily the case with elf let's see what's happening with the fundamentals but I wouldn't touch this this is a broken Momo stock and I want nothing to do with it so let's just see if the fundamentals make me wrong um but usually this now cash flows eroding uh yeah we don't really care about pees what we care about is normalized earnings power and a normalized multiple on that normalized earnings power so there's no way to tell what the actual PE is because the business is just in its nent stages of deceleration and this has been a promote so let's see John marmo uh what's your opinion on Celsius and Charles River Celsius we've covered probably looking interesting I look uh we're not going to do anything with it but I think that's probably interesting Charles River uh I like stuff in the medical device this is probably another highquality business I'd be interested in let's take crl yeah definitely interested in Charles River so uh we have exposure to medical devices through Baxter uh but this is probably one worth looking at as well I like Baxter because it's more of a turnaround story but this one uh is also pretty solid business let's see what the balance sheet looks like uh this might be where you have your risk yeah uh $200 million in cash 2.2 billion of debt let's see if the share count has been [Music] okay it's just they can't get their revenues moving that that's been their problem uh let's just take a look at annual yeah actually it's okay uh let's take a look at at share count all right not bad yeah I think this one's definitely worth doing some work on uh that's probably pretty decent find uh not when I'm in a rush but I think it's uh definitely worth looking at John Robert wanan Advanced Auto Parts in Stanley Black and Decker made in Mexico and China tff's Canna influence the stock performance in a negative way it's already done it that's I mean if you're at the Market discounts so it's like sell the rumor buy the news everyone's known tariffs are coming then once you get the flush on that then you can actually buy the stock um so I think it's fine and we covered kind of why thoughts on selones we've covered that a million times Alex we kind of like it here uh worth doing some work on FMC we kind of like it here that's from that Philipe pinkos FMC same story we like that uh Marlin staltz AMD uh what people expected do you think this come uh I'd rather stay with Intel uh Dale Wilson Walgreens I'm not interested in that business it'll probably be okay but I'm not interested it's just you know the world has changed it there probably be one or two left standing if it's two it's going to be CVS and Walmart uh Walgreens if it's one it's going to be CVS so um that's more of a trade than some something I want to own they'll sell off the Walgreens boots Alliance that's fine they'll pay down debt I still don't think it's a great business uh asking why I don't mention Intel I I did mention Intel I just said it's going to be dead money until they announce a new CEO and that's what it's been Tim D Celsius holding same story definitely worth doing some work we're not doing anything with it but I understand why you like it uh love your podcast you set up stop losses on positions no it's uh that's for retail Traders Robert War tanan Stanis no auto companies are Healthcare and annuity companies masquerading as vehicle producers and never want to be on the OEM side I'll be in the arms dealer side on Cooper standard Jimmy Jones uh Apple decline of sales in China due to regulation that and he's getting out competed by Huawei I mean you can google pictures of Jensen Wong with the Huawei full in phones they're 100 times better than Apple phones I mean it's just mindboggling uh what's going on and uh Apple's looking to partner with China Ai and Cloud to bypass these issues due to regulation what are your thought some Baba Baba's going up there's apple or not okay that's the bottom line uh JP ding how much will the 25% H tariffs her cooperon look there's not another what do you think is going to happen Okay do you think someone's going to say oh you know what I want to do let me go raise $100 million to set up a plant to make rubber sealers for US Auto cars uh in the middle of Mississippi at $50 an hour plus all kinds of regulations and OSHA and whoever knows what uh so I can get competed Away by people who can ship it in cheaper even after paying the tariffs at the end of the day the demand is not going to change for the type of products that Cooper standard sells the question is how much is the end consumer going to pay for it and that's up to Trump uh you know but uh inflation is just a tax on the poor and that's exactly what that will create in a short term so um you guys got to think think this through a little bit Gunther van arcott uh then thank you blah blah blah yeah same question everyone's asking the same question it's mindboggling uh Rahul batia congrats on BF Corp have you looked at Crocs or bird we have looked at Crocs have zero interest all birds is a garbage company um complete fad that's going to be toast uh on to the next that's it so one of these days I'll tell you how I really feel but in the meantime I want to thank you for tuning in uh we'll be back next week same time same place in the meantime make it a great one bye for now oh [Music] [Music] oh [Music] [Music]
