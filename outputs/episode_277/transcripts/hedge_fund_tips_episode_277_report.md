## Macro Thesis & Key Data Points
The market is transitioning from a growth-dominated environment to one where value and international stocks will outperform. Tariffs and regulatory pressures will negatively impact the Magnificent 7. Focus should be on companies with strong fundamentals and those benefiting from the manufacturing recovery and global policy shifts.

| Indicator | Value | Tom's Interpretation |
|-----------|-------|----------------------|
| Global Policy Rate Cuts | Peaked at 62 cuts last year, now declining | This is a positive sign, indicating good things start to happen in the market. |
| European Stocks Earnings Multiple | Lower than US peers | International and US exceptionalism runs in normal cyclical peaks and troughs, and this time will be no different. |
| US Manufacturing Activity | Expanding for the first time since 2022 | Coming out of a 2-year manufacturing depression in the United States, this is a positive thing. |
| Earnings Growth | Accelerating in small cap, mid cap, and international stocks | Go where the earnings growth is accelerating. |
| Consumer Staples Relative PE | Lowest relative PE ratio since 2001 | A lot of stuff is going to get bid here, no one's positioned for it, that's going to be an opportunity. |
| Japanese Yen | Starting to strengthen | These are the things that we tend to keep an eye on as the carry trade unwinds which means billions upon billions of free Yen that has been parked in mag 7 is coming out this is the story not deep seek it's the carry trade onwi and no one's paying attention to it and when you try to talk about it no one wants to hear about it so I don't talk about it but I just benefit from it |
