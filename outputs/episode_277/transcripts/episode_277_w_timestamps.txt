[00:00:00] welcome to hedge fun tips with Tom Hayes
[00:00:03] I'm Tom Hayes and this is your
[00:00:06] 277th videoast podcast for the week
[00:00:08] ending February 6 2025 got a lot to get
[00:00:12] to this week a lot of exciting stuff but
[00:00:14] family first as always uh that's me with
[00:00:18] Annabelle the girls had something like
[00:00:20] eight games between them this weekend
[00:00:22] for water polo pretty exciting I had the
[00:00:24] pleasure to speak to an amazing group
[00:00:27] about 4 or 500 high school students at
[00:00:30] linta High School in Westminster
[00:00:33] California home of the
[00:00:35] Aztecs uh really incredible time we're
[00:00:38] going to go into that a little bit here
[00:00:40] today want to thank cork Snider the AP
[00:00:44] Statistics teacher over at linta high
[00:00:47] school he has a Tik Tock Channel called
[00:00:51] statman for those of you who want
[00:00:53] amazing tutorials on statistics
[00:00:56] definitely check out statman on Tik Tok
[00:00:59] thanks again cork for organizing
[00:01:01] everything he's been a longtime listener
[00:01:03] uh very grateful for that uh this was a
[00:01:07] just a picture showing Chinese
[00:01:09] retaliation against us tariffs you can
[00:01:12] see 15% tariff on us LNG and coal
[00:01:15] Imports 10% on us oil pickup trucks farm
[00:01:19] equipment
[00:01:21] and uh restrict critical mineral exports
[00:01:26] and antimonopoly probe into to Google
[00:01:29] the consensus on this was that China's
[00:01:31] response implied they have more to lose
[00:01:34] than we do it appears there will not be
[00:01:37] an escalation Beyond this uh as it
[00:01:40] relates to China so that's a
[00:01:42] constructive outcome and we're seeing it
[00:01:44] there here were the students as uh they
[00:01:47] were finishing up I this must no this is
[00:01:51] when they
[00:01:52] were just coming in or just leaving
[00:01:55] anyway uh this was packed once we got
[00:01:57] going and uh
[00:02:01] this shows
[00:02:03] the
[00:02:05] uh
[00:02:07] trade
[00:02:08] differential uh by country so China's
[00:02:11] the biggest euro is the second biggest
[00:02:13] Mexico Vietnam and
[00:02:16] Taiwan and that's one of the other
[00:02:19] teachers and then uh in one of the games
[00:02:22] had one goal just to show one of their
[00:02:25] kids' goals I love this one from
[00:02:27] Mimi she gets a breakway way incredible
[00:02:30] pass from her team we puts it
[00:02:33] away and we're off to it the other thing
[00:02:36] since I had the privilege to talk to
[00:02:38] these amazing students uh cork students
[00:02:41] over there at linta I wanted to just
[00:02:44] kind of go through some books that I
[00:02:46] thought were important as a reading list
[00:02:48] we get that question quite a bit uh so
[00:02:50] first Seth clar's margin of safety Ben
[00:02:54] Grahams intelligent investor Ben Graham
[00:02:56] security analysis Peter Lynch one up on
[00:02:58] Wall Street Peter Lynch beating the
[00:03:00] street Joel greenblat you can be a stock
[00:03:03] market genius thoron OG glove the
[00:03:05] quality of earnings Lawrence Cunningham
[00:03:08] essays of Warren Buffett Robert hagstrom
[00:03:11] the Warren Buffett way and Christine
[00:03:14] Richard Confidence Game uh and then
[00:03:17] finally a few others
[00:03:19] here
[00:03:20] uh inside the Investments of Warren
[00:03:23] Buffett 20 cases from
[00:03:25] Lou uh margin of safety with claran we
[00:03:28] covered that measuring the moat by
[00:03:31] malbus I think he's over at Morgan
[00:03:33] Stanley he writes some really good stuff
[00:03:36] uh value investing by Greenwald poor
[00:03:38] Charlie's Almanac of
[00:03:41] course
[00:03:43] uh psychology of human misjudgment by
[00:03:46] Munger The Outsiders by Thorndike for
[00:03:49] sure uh quality investing by I
[00:03:52] Cunningham and why Moes matter by
[00:03:55] Collins and Brilliant so those are some
[00:03:57] things for the students to read if they
[00:04:00] want to go in this direction for sure
[00:04:02] then I would like to
[00:04:05] thank Christian dagger Preston miselle
[00:04:09] and the great Stuart vanney for having
[00:04:12] me on Monday when the market was down I
[00:04:16] think the D was down like 500 points or
[00:04:18] 600 points in the morning they texted me
[00:04:20] hey can you do a phoner real quick and
[00:04:22] tell us what's going on so I was
[00:04:24] grateful and happy to do that we did
[00:04:26] that so we're going to listen in here
[00:04:29] on that market it is a sell-off we're
[00:04:32] not coming back much at all the Dow's
[00:04:33] off 600 Nas NASDAQ down 470 S&P is down
[00:04:38] 110 uh on the phone joining us now to
[00:04:40] cover this Market Thomas Hayes all right
[00:04:42] Thomas um this is a big sell-off do you
[00:04:46] see any buying are you buying anything
[00:04:49] this is a big dip you're buying
[00:04:51] anything I've got my shopping list ready
[00:04:54] stew I think this is a great opportunity
[00:04:56] look Goldman Sachs was out this morning
[00:04:58] saying if this is fully implemented and
[00:05:01] they don't come to any agreements today
[00:05:02] you're looking at EPS dropping 2 to 3%
[00:05:06] and maximum on the S&P 500 down 5% so I
[00:05:10] think the way to look at this is we're
[00:05:12] looking across our positions in the
[00:05:14] portfolio things that we love before
[00:05:16] Friday we still love we're going to be
[00:05:19] slowly adding in over the next couple of
[00:05:21] days we're going to be looking for new
[00:05:23] opportunities I mean look earnings have
[00:05:25] been phenomenal you you know we we're
[00:05:28] 77% beat rate
[00:05:30] 13.2% earnings growth we had a positive
[00:05:33] January if history is any prolog that
[00:05:36] means the uh S&P is up 89% of the time
[00:05:39] so there's a lot to like here and then
[00:05:41] we just saw the ISM Manufacturing Index
[00:05:44] come in better than expected we're
[00:05:46] coming out of a 2year manufacturing
[00:05:49] depression in the United States this is
[00:05:50] a positive thing okay give me a name or
[00:05:52] two what are you buying well look I'll
[00:05:55] tell you one that I've talked about with
[00:05:56] your viewers on the show uh it's up
[00:05:58] about 10% with since we started talking
[00:06:00] about it is Etsy is the beneficiary of
[00:06:04] this di Minimus uh exemption that teu
[00:06:08] and Sheen has been taking advantage of
[00:06:10] they're no longer going to get away with
[00:06:12] shipping junk into this country under
[00:06:14] 800 bucks with no tariff so Etsy who has
[00:06:17] the uh domestic people make the products
[00:06:20] is up today on this news tremendous
[00:06:22] company billion dollar buyback
[00:06:24] recovering internationally growing the
[00:06:26] men's business growing the gifting
[00:06:28] business so that's one that we want to
[00:06:29] add to on this uh sell off Etsy I shall
[00:06:32] remember that the chotsky store as I
[00:06:35] tend to call it Thomas H thanks very
[00:06:37] much
[00:06:38] indeed and we're back and then on
[00:06:41] Wednesday I had the privilege of doing a
[00:06:43] normal spot um which was a great segment
[00:06:47] uh right here also with Stuart thanks to
[00:06:49] Christian and to Preston we're going to
[00:06:52] listen in here an investigation into
[00:06:55] Apple's App Store and that's taken 2%
[00:06:58] off Apple stock down to 227 Thomas Hayes
[00:07:01] joins us this morning Apple's down on
[00:07:03] this possible China probe the Europeans
[00:07:05] May retaliate against big Tech American
[00:07:08] big tech for tariffs imposed by Trump
[00:07:10] big picture question is Big Tech in
[00:07:12] trouble
[00:07:14] Tom well it's February stew buckle up
[00:07:17] buttercup and get your shopping list
[00:07:19] ready I think we've been suggesting to
[00:07:22] trim your magnificent 7 as a theme for
[00:07:25] 2025 and part of that is rooted in this
[00:07:28] in this trade issue but part of it is
[00:07:30] earnings growth has been decelerating
[00:07:32] going to decelerate from 33% last year
[00:07:36] to 21% this year but the multiples are
[00:07:38] still elevated and you're seeing all
[00:07:40] this capex you saw it with alphabet last
[00:07:42] night they took their capex estimates
[00:07:45] from 60 billion to 75 billion and they
[00:07:48] missed on cloud service Revenue so this
[00:07:51] is a lot of defensive spending we have
[00:07:54] yet to see the return on invested
[00:07:56] capital for all this capex so I think
[00:07:58] Mag 7 is take a little bit of a breather
[00:08:00] and you want to play that rotation theme
[00:08:03] that began in summer of last year let's
[00:08:06] take these two big stocks in turn first
[00:08:08] of all Apple uh are they now mixed up in
[00:08:11] Trump's dispute with China and if so uh
[00:08:15] are they going up or are they going down
[00:08:16] some
[00:08:18] more yeah I think US Stock Market
[00:08:21] exceptionalism has been tied to the mag
[00:08:23] 7 the concentration is a third I do
[00:08:26] think they're going to be Target number
[00:08:28] one not only for China but for the EU
[00:08:31] has put together this anti- coercive
[00:08:33] instrument they're readying if Trump
[00:08:35] levies tariffs they're going to hit back
[00:08:37] with that Apple has a monopoly with the
[00:08:40] App Store they get 30% Vig on every
[00:08:42] single app so that's going to be an easy
[00:08:44] target for some of these foreign
[00:08:45] governments as uh tariffs are Levy for
[00:08:48] sure Google is way down they're spending
[00:08:51] $75 billion in this year this financial
[00:08:55] year on AI do they need to spend so much
[00:08:59] money when China comes along with deep
[00:09:01] seek and does it much
[00:09:04] cheaper it's an existential threat and
[00:09:07] this is defensive spending I think
[00:09:09] you've got to lower your overweight to
[00:09:12] mag 7 I think you want to take advantage
[00:09:14] of some of the
[00:09:16] unmagnify because the the bottom line is
[00:09:18] go where the earnings growth is
[00:09:20] accelerating it's accelerating this year
[00:09:22] in the rest of the market last year was
[00:09:25] the mag s story lighten up just a little
[00:09:27] bit light you know if you're in IND sees
[00:09:29] you are overweight mag 7 you want to
[00:09:31] start to look at some of the cheaper
[00:09:33] stocks for 2025 for sure got it Tom
[00:09:36] Hayes thanks for joining us this morning
[00:09:37] big day thank you Tom now this
[00:09:41] demonstrators and we're back and then
[00:09:44] we're going to go into this presentation
[00:09:48] to the students at linta I think it's
[00:09:51] valuable number one understanding the
[00:09:53] difference between value and growth
[00:09:55] investing and the history behind that
[00:09:57] and then number two I got some really
[00:09:58] great life questions that I think many
[00:10:01] of you will find uh useful and valuable
[00:10:05] in terms of the kind of impromptu
[00:10:07] responses so we're going to listen in
[00:10:10] here so our principal from Harvard there

[00:12:25] residents of California so uh really
[00:12:28] honored to be here my wife came up with
[00:12:30] this crazy idea in September and I
[00:12:33] saidwell if we're going to live in
[00:12:34] Southern California we got to be able to
[00:12:36] see the beach from our house and we got
[00:12:37] to be able to walk to the beach from our
[00:12:38] house and uh we've been blessed to do
[00:12:41] that and and meet some wonderful people
[00:12:43] along the way so um I'm going to go
[00:12:46] through a
[00:12:47] presentation and I wish I had seen a
[00:12:50] presentation like this when I was your
[00:12:52] age because uh it could have probably
[00:12:54] sped up my career even more so than it
[00:12:56] has been uh I look a lot younger than I
[00:12:59] than I am and uh uh I won't correct you
[00:13:03] so uh I I go on Neil Cavuto are are you
[00:13:07] guys familiar with a TV station called
[00:13:09] Fox
[00:13:10] Business so there's a legendary
[00:13:13] broadcaster named Neil Cavuto and I'd go
[00:13:15] on his show as recent as a couple months
[00:13:17] ago before he retired and he would
[00:13:19] always say this young man is the
[00:13:21] smartest guy I've ever and I just said I
[00:13:24] don't correct Mr Neil Cavuto he's an
[00:13:26] absolute Legend but I'm not much of a
[00:13:28] Young Man
[00:13:30] um so we want to talk about the
[00:13:32] fundamentals of value investing and some
[00:13:35] of the edges that I've developed over
[00:13:37] the years um as cork was saying I run my
[00:13:41] own firm it's called great Hill Capital
[00:13:44] uh his AUM numbers he's projecting into
[00:13:46] the future we're not quite that big at
[00:13:48] this point but we're going to get there
[00:13:50] for sure uh the way things are going
[00:13:52] with performance and with uh everything
[00:13:54] we've been able to build prior to that
[00:13:57] are any of you old enough to remember
[00:13:59] the movie The Big Short it was with Brad
[00:14:03] Pit it chronicled the housing crisis so
[00:14:06] prior to going on my own I worked for
[00:14:08] one of the firms featured in that movie
[00:14:10] uh called Cornwall Capital they were one
[00:14:12] of the few who got the housing crisis
[00:14:15] correct made a tremendous amount of
[00:14:17] money on that trade and then before that
[00:14:20] the first fund I was at was a a fund
[00:14:22] called Bedford Oak advisers and the
[00:14:25] principal of that firm was a man named
[00:14:27] Harvey Eisen and he was friends with
[00:14:29] Warren Buffett for 40 years uh so I got
[00:14:32] to learn and cut my teeth in the value
[00:14:35] investing philosophy we would uh fly out
[00:14:38] on Mario gabelli's jet every single year
[00:14:40] and that was exciting for me I was you
[00:14:42] know late 20s early 30s going on a
[00:14:44] private jet to the birkshire hathway
[00:14:46] annual meeting as I like to say off to
[00:14:49] see the wizard the wonderful Wizard of
[00:14:50] Oz which was Warren Buffett and though
[00:14:53] those meetings and those uh Berkshire
[00:14:56] annual meetings really and the
[00:14:59] mentorship of Harvey uh laid the
[00:15:02] foundation of my investing philosophy uh
[00:15:05] and it completely changed my life and
[00:15:07] for a couple of you in this room today
[00:15:10] you're going to hear something or see
[00:15:12] something and you're going to say that
[00:15:14] makes perfect sense to me and then
[00:15:15] you're going to read a couple of books
[00:15:16] and you're going to get some experience
[00:15:18] and um you're going to wind up becoming
[00:15:21] very very successful investors and I
[00:15:24] will say uh it's a lifestyle second to
[00:15:26] none if you love it and you learn the
[00:15:29] few principles that will set you
[00:15:32] apart so our philosophy in a nutshell is
[00:15:37] kind of unpopular these days right now
[00:15:40] everyone wants to chase the shiny
[00:15:42] objects which crypto coin which inidia
[00:15:45] which uh uh trumpcoin Melania coin I
[00:15:49] mean there's all kinds of crazy things
[00:15:51] and that's a sign of froth in a market
[00:15:53] and the these are the type of areas
[00:15:56] often times you want to avoid and stick
[00:15:58] to basic
[00:15:59] principles we make our money buying on
[00:16:02] weakness and selling on strength what
[00:16:04] you're seeing in the marketplace right
[00:16:06] now uh due to recency bias is people are
[00:16:09] buying those things that are popular in
[00:16:11] the news today uh that are already up a
[00:16:14] lot hoping that someone comes in behind
[00:16:17] them and pays more for the asset even
[00:16:19] though the intrinsic value is not there
[00:16:23] um that will work until it doesn't and
[00:16:25] when it ends it ends badly uh
[00:16:29] our confidence to step in when others
[00:16:31] are bailing is root rooted in deep
[00:16:32] research and the premise that the more
[00:16:35] price becomes dislocated the more risk
[00:16:37] has been removed we're going to talk
[00:16:39] about a company today called VF Corp and
[00:16:43] VF Corp owns a few Brands you might be
[00:16:46] familiar with uh anyone wearing vans
[00:16:50] today
[00:16:53] anyone okay we've got huge opportunity
[00:16:55] for
[00:16:56] turnaround uh how many of you were
[00:16:58] wearing bands two three years
[00:17:01] ago okay all right so the trend hasn't
[00:17:03] come back to linta high school yet how
[00:17:06] about
[00:17:08] Northface okay pretty much everyone's
[00:17:10] wearing Northface how about
[00:17:15] Timberland okay we have our okay uh how
[00:17:20] about do you have a backpack Jansport
[00:17:23] East pack any you carry books around
[00:17:26] okay so VF Corp owns all that
[00:17:29] and the cool thing about investing is
[00:17:31] you can learn how to invest in things
[00:17:33] that you know and make a tremendous
[00:17:35] amount of money doing it particularly if
[00:17:36] you do it for other people as well uh
[00:17:38] over time so a lot of times when most
[00:17:43] Mar Market participants see volatility
[00:17:45] as increased risk we view it as
[00:17:48] increased opportunity okay when a stock
[00:17:50] is down a lot what do most people say
[00:17:53] about that stock don't invest in that
[00:17:55] stock it's risky right okay um however
[00:18:00] if you pick up a few skills that we're
[00:18:02] going to talk about here and you
[00:18:03] actually learn to see under the hood and
[00:18:05] see what the business is worth sometimes
[00:18:08] those dislocations in price are
[00:18:10] opportunities in a lifetime and what we
[00:18:12] try to do is we look for businesses that
[00:18:14] are marked down sometimes 60% 70% 80%
[00:18:18] that we can make two three four times
[00:18:20] our money in a few years uh of that
[00:18:23] stock would you guys be interested in
[00:18:24] making two three four times your money
[00:18:26] from time to time would that be valuable
[00:18:28] okay
[00:18:36] okay so it's interest did did the clap
[00:18:40] light go on or something because uh
[00:18:43] something you know I heard that this is
[00:18:45] a caffeine-free
[00:18:47] campus uh we might have to change that
[00:18:49] ladies and gentlemen I know you just had
[00:18:51] lunch um the philosophy of our firm and
[00:18:55] what I learned from Warren Buffett and
[00:18:56] from my first Mentor is great inv
[00:18:59] opportunities come around when excellent
[00:19:00] companies are surrounded by unusual
[00:19:03] circumstances that cause the stock to be
[00:19:28] stocks and I have no view on crypto uh
[00:19:31] either way I said to
[00:19:32] him uh let me ask you a question Terry
[00:19:36] if you put all your money into Bitcoin
[00:19:38] tonight and you walk up tomorrow and it
[00:19:41] was worth zero would you be
[00:19:44] surprised and he looked at me and he
[00:19:46] goes if I'm being honest probably not I
[00:19:49] wouldn't be I'd be disappointed but I
[00:19:50] wouldn't be surprised I said okay I said
[00:19:52] how about this Terry uh we're here close
[00:19:55] to an Anaheim California I said Disney
[00:19:58] stock price is down about 55% from its
[00:20:01] recent High
[00:20:03] 55% if you put 100% of your money into
[00:20:07] Disney stock down 55% and you walk up
[00:20:09] tomorrow and it was Zero would you be
[00:20:13] surprised and he said I would be shocked
[00:20:16] and I said well that's exactly how we
[00:20:17] manage risk so when you get an
[00:20:20] opportunity to buy a highquality asset
[00:20:22] like Disney okay does everyone love
[00:20:23] Disney here okay Anaheim California how
[00:20:26] many of you have been to Disney uh more
[00:20:29] than once raise your
[00:20:31] hand okay a lot more of you than than
[00:20:34] wear Vans that's for sure uh twice three
[00:20:37] times this is never going to change
[00:20:39] because the way it works is if you're a
[00:20:41] parent and I've got two daughters 10
[00:20:43] years old and 12 years old and you don't
[00:20:46] take your children to Disney at least
[00:20:47] once Social Services comes to your house
[00:20:50] and they remove the children from the
[00:20:52] house and they say that you are not a
[00:20:54] fit parent you're abusing your child by
[00:20:56] not bringing them to Disney this is the
[00:20:58] American way it it's always been that
[00:21:00] way it's it's uh always going to be that
[00:21:03] way um but Disney has running cycles for
[00:21:06] many many years uh in 1984 the stock
[00:21:10] also fell over
[00:21:11] 55% the bass family which is a large
[00:21:14] wealthy oil family from Texas bought a
[00:21:17] controlling stake in Disney uh made
[00:21:19] about uh five times their money over 10
[00:21:24] years made a few billion dollars doing
[00:21:26] that and the reason that Disney had
[00:21:28] fallen so much in the 80s is very
[00:21:29] similar to the reason it had fallen so
[00:21:31] much recently is they had to find a new
[00:21:35] way to sell their legacy IP Library
[00:21:38] their Content Library and back in
[00:21:41] 1984 they were transitioning to
[00:21:43] something called the VHS cassette no one
[00:21:46] here is going to know does anyone here
[00:21:47] know what a VHS cassette is oh my
[00:21:50] goodness
[00:21:51] okay okay so that's uh what do they call
[00:21:54] that retro guys okay so uh they figured
[00:21:57] out that they were to take the Content
[00:21:59] Library that had preceded for 20 years
[00:22:01] and put it on this device called a VHS
[00:22:03] tape stock was down they're like that's
[00:22:05] going to cost too much much money that
[00:22:07] won't be profitable sounds very similar
[00:22:09] to what the transition from DVDs to
[00:22:12] streaming and for the last few years
[00:22:14] Disney lost money streaming now they're
[00:22:16] starting to make money and the stock is
[00:22:18] going to double over the next few years
[00:22:20] again all this is opinion not advice
[00:22:22] thanks to uh thanks for putting that
[00:22:25] together Mr Snider uh so that's that
[00:22:31] now how many of you actually
[00:22:34] are uh interested in stocks and making
[00:22:37] money in the stock
[00:22:39] market quite a few of you okay how many
[00:22:42] of you have tried your hand at day
[00:22:46] trading okay how many of you prefer
[00:22:48] investing over day
[00:22:50] trading okay so I've Got the Right
[00:22:52] audience this is very good um so how
[00:22:55] does value investing work I mean the
[00:22:57] concept is very simp simp and what's
[00:22:59] easier said than done is to buy low sell
[00:23:03] high and investing with a margin of
[00:23:05] safety by purchasing stocks below their
[00:23:07] intrinsic value you know it's
[00:23:10] interesting with Disney for instance
[00:23:12] down 55% do you think their revenues
[00:23:14] fell
[00:23:16] 55% no okay did their cash flow is
[00:23:19] temporarily impaired because of the
[00:23:21] investment in streaming yes uh but on
[00:23:23] balance we see these normal cycles that
[00:23:26] repeat over and over when you buy
[00:23:28] long-term durable businesses that have
[00:23:30] lasted decades and you can buy them
[00:23:33] during these cyclical troughs and sell
[00:23:35] them when everyone gets excited in two
[00:23:37] three years you're going to remember
[00:23:38] this you'll be in college everyone will
[00:23:40] be like have you seen Disney's stock
[00:23:42] it's up like a 100% in the last few
[00:23:44] years should should I buy Disney stock
[00:23:46] my doorman will be coming to me in three
[00:23:48] years and be like you know Disney's now
[00:23:50] $250 should I buy Disney stock I'm going
[00:23:52] to say no we had that conversation like
[00:23:54] three years ago you should have bought
[00:23:55] it then let's talk about something else
[00:23:57] that's that's down a lot um so we seek
[00:24:02] high quality companies that are
[00:24:03] temporarily out of favor uh some things
[00:24:06] that are down a lot deserve to be down
[00:24:08] and may be going out of business and
[00:24:10] your job as an investor is going to be
[00:24:13] to figure out which ones are quality
[00:24:15] businesses that are temporarily impaired
[00:24:18] and which ones are actually permanently
[00:24:20] impaired maybe they've been disrupted
[00:24:22] maybe they don't have a competitive moat
[00:24:24] maybe their technology is no longer
[00:24:25] relevant which is why we tend to avoid
[00:24:29] most technology stocks we learned that
[00:24:31] from Buffett because you can get
[00:24:32] disrupted in a heartbeat because the
[00:24:34] barrier to entry is very low um and then
[00:24:38] this strategy when you're buying stocks
[00:24:41] with low and I and I'm going to
[00:24:43] emphasize this word normalized price to
[00:24:46] earnings ratios normalized Price to Book
[00:24:49] price to cash flow uh good I saved that
[00:24:52] don't know where that went
[00:24:55] um this favors reversion to the mean
[00:24:59] okay and how many of you know what
[00:25:01] reversion to the mean is any statistics
[00:25:05] who wants to throw out a a broad
[00:25:07] definition for
[00:25:09] us how about you
[00:25:16] yeah yeah that's that's absolutely
[00:25:20] right give him a hand
[00:25:28] by the way the company that owns Vans
[00:25:32] and Timberland and North Face how long
[00:25:35] do you think they've been in
[00:25:39] business any idea any guesses when do
[00:25:41] you think they
[00:25:45] started1 1899 here's a smart guy right
[00:25:47] in the front row so they've been around
[00:25:49] for 120 years trading in and out of
[00:25:52] different portfolio Brands that's the
[00:25:55] type of durable business that over time
[00:25:58] if you can buy it you know it was down
[00:26:02] 88% after the last cycle why because
[00:26:05] they loaded the Channel with Vans all of
[00:26:07] you probably have two three pairs of
[00:26:09] vans in your in your closet from three
[00:26:11] years ago that's all getting worked
[00:26:12] through and then the next cycle will
[00:26:14] come back and your probably your younger
[00:26:16] brothers and sisters are are buying what
[00:26:18] the new school Vans which have the puffy
[00:26:21] thing on the side and they'll come back
[00:26:22] and it'll be another thing um growth
[00:26:26] investing varies from value and
[00:26:28] investing and that growth is more
[00:26:30] chasing the shiny objects betting on the
[00:26:32] future trying to predict the future uh I
[00:26:35] can tell you that I've been around for a
[00:26:39] while and I've seen a lot of money made
[00:26:41] and a lot of money lost there are a lot
[00:26:44] more people certainly if you look at the
[00:26:46] Forbes 400
[00:26:47] list there's only one guy on that list
[00:26:51] who has made it as a growth
[00:26:53] investor uh but there are probably a
[00:26:56] couple
[00:26:57] dozen value investors on the Forbes 400
[00:27:00] and for those of you who think musk is
[00:27:03] the wealthiest guy in the world he is uh
[00:27:06] and he's absolutely changed the world
[00:27:08] but Buffett I mean I know he's only
[00:27:10] worth 150 billion uh but what people
[00:27:13] forget is he already gave away half of
[00:27:14] his wealth to charity so if you add that
[00:27:17] back uh Buffett's done pretty well
[00:27:19] following a simple strategy buying
[00:27:21] things like Coca-Cola company uh buying
[00:27:24] things like uh American Express buying
[00:27:28] durable businesses that last through
[00:27:30] Cycles so growth you're chasing the
[00:27:33] nvidias of the world if you
[00:27:35] remember June 20th there was a picture
[00:27:39] of uh how we doing on time
[00:27:44] cor 45 minutes okay so um June 20th
[00:27:49] there was a picture of Jensen
[00:27:52] Wong signing for the whole thing
[00:27:54] including Q&A okay uh signing
[00:27:59] someone's uh I don't know the right way
[00:28:01] to say it bikini top let's just put it
[00:28:04] that way like he was a rock star like he
[00:28:06] had that level of fandom and that level
[00:28:08] of euphoria and the minute I saw that
[00:28:10] level of excitement I put out an article
[00:28:12] on my website hedone tips.com which said
[00:28:16] the next pain trade okay and I didn't
[00:28:19] get the timing right it went from 140 to
[00:28:21] 153 and then I went on Stuart Varney's
[00:28:23] show on Fox Business and I said uh
[00:28:26] there's a story called there's there's a
[00:28:28] story of Icarus Icarus flew too close to
[00:28:32] the Sun and what happened to the
[00:28:34] wings the wings started to melt and I
[00:28:36] said the good news is uh his wings
[00:28:39] haven't started to melt yet the bad news
[00:28:41] is competition is coming and we're
[00:28:43] starting to see that and what happened
[00:28:44] in the past week with
[00:28:48] AI deep
[00:28:50] seek competition's coming they can
[00:28:54] generate similar type of models similar
[00:28:56] type of returns with much
[00:28:59] uh more inferior chips and that's just
[00:29:03] the beginning which is going to be good
[00:29:04] for Humanity it's it's probably going to
[00:29:06] be a little bit of a headwind for NVIDIA
[00:29:09] and Nvidia was pricing in great things
[00:29:11] Nvidia will do great things but price is
[00:29:13] what you pay values what you get so what
[00:29:15] we try to
[00:29:16] do is
[00:29:18] distinguish facts from reality so right
[00:29:21] now everyone thinks if I can just pick
[00:29:23] the next Tesla if I can pick the next
[00:29:25] Nvidia if I can pick the next uh
[00:29:28] Etc uh I will do better than everyone
[00:29:33] else if you go back to
[00:29:37] 1927 value has outperformed growth the
[00:29:40] strategy of buying low and selling High
[00:29:42] versus buying high and selling Higher by
[00:29:46] 4.5% per year for over a hundred years
[00:29:50] only in the last 10 years has growth
[00:29:52] outperformed value and part of that was
[00:29:55] a function of zero interest rate policy
[00:29:58] from the FED which is no longer going to
[00:30:00] persist we're moving to a more
[00:30:02] normalized rate environment so unless
[00:30:04] you believe rates are going back down to
[00:30:05] zero you want to look at the long-term
[00:30:07] data which favors and write this down if
[00:30:09] you remember nothing from that tall guy
[00:30:12] who came to your high school class five
[00:30:14] years ago when you buy high quality
[00:30:18] assets at good prices good things tend
[00:30:21] to
[00:30:22] happen if that's all you remember from
[00:30:25] Tom Hayes for the rest of your life by
[00:30:27] High quality assets at good prices good
[00:30:31] things will happen over time that is the
[00:30:33] most important message and this proves
[00:30:35] it
[00:30:36] so let's say you set aside a certain
[00:30:39] amount of money every single month like
[00:30:40] you hear about to retire you put it in
[00:30:43] the S&P
[00:30:44] 500 all this means the 4 and a half% a
[00:30:47] year doesn't sound like much what it
[00:30:50] means in real terms is over that time
[00:30:52] period your money would have doubled
[00:30:55] four times more
[00:30:58] if you were invested in value than if
[00:31:01] you were invested in
[00:31:03] growth okay so instead of getting to two
[00:31:06] you would have got to four to 8 to 16 to
[00:31:09] 32 You' probably have 32 million more if
[00:31:13] you just pick the right strategy over
[00:31:14] the long term uh than if you were
[00:31:16] chasing the shiny objects and getting
[00:31:18] hit by buses when when the fever
[00:31:22] breaks uh when we're buying things down
[00:31:25] I'll cover a couple of things here uh we
[00:31:27] tried to do solvency risk analysis so
[00:31:30] key thing is you know we did a simple
[00:31:32] example about Disney and VF Corp are
[00:31:35] they going out of business because if it
[00:31:36] stock's down 80% there are people in the
[00:31:39] market that think that company is going
[00:31:41] out of business so you have to look at
[00:31:42] the balance sheet you have to look at
[00:31:44] their cash flows you have to look at
[00:31:45] their revenues and once you can get
[00:31:47] confidence they're not going out of
[00:31:48] business and they have Runway then you
[00:31:50] start to look does the business have a
[00:31:53] moat does it have a competitive
[00:31:54] Advantage uh how's management in the
[00:31:58] case of VF Corp they got a new manager
[00:32:00] named Daryl Bracken okay Daryl previous
[00:32:05] pre previously ran a company called
[00:32:08] Logitech are you guys familiar with or
[00:32:10] Logitech do you guys any gamers in the
[00:32:13] room
[00:32:15] okay Logitech makes this little simple
[00:32:18] thing called a mouse and they make this
[00:32:20] other thing called a camera are there
[00:32:23] any other companies be besides Logitech
[00:32:25] that you can buy a mouse or camera from
[00:32:27] it's like unlimited right it's a
[00:32:29] commodity product but Bracken is a
[00:32:31] special manager Bracken came in as the
[00:32:34] manager of Logitech the CEO when the
[00:32:37] stock was 80 down 82% in
[00:32:40] 2013 over the next seven years he turned
[00:32:44] the company out around the stock went up
[00:32:47] 26 times now Logitech was not curing
[00:32:50] cancer okay what they were doing was
[00:32:53] selling little plastic mouses that
[00:32:54] anyone could manufacture in China they
[00:32:57] were they were they had these little
[00:32:58] cameras but due to his management his
[00:33:01] positioning Etc if you had invested
[00:33:05] $100,000 that would have turned into 2.6
[00:33:08] million in about seven years is that
[00:33:10] pretty impressive so when he came into
[00:33:14] VF Corp and the stock was down 88% down
[00:33:18] from some $90 down to 13 12 $11 we got
[00:33:23] extremely interested in VF cour because
[00:33:25] number one we had done the solvency
[00:33:27] analysis we've done the mode analysis we
[00:33:29] we done the uh we had the management
[00:33:32] Catalyst and then near-term Catalyst was
[00:33:34] Brack and Daryl taking over uh our basis
[00:33:36] was $15 in change it's it got up to $27
[00:33:40] recently and it's just getting started
[00:33:42] so we'll probably make three or four
[00:33:43] bags on that three or four times over
[00:33:46] time and that's all we do rinse and
[00:33:49] repeat um two things that give us an
[00:33:52] advantage over our competitors number
[00:33:55] one time Horizon we we take it a
[00:33:58] long-term view uh our average holding
[00:34:00] period is one to five years I know
[00:34:02] that's not fancy nowadays it's h one to
[00:34:04] five minutes if you follow Tik Tok uh
[00:34:08] they want you in in the afternoon with
[00:34:10] zero day options and out by
[00:34:12] 4M uh that gambling sooner or later
[00:34:18] always catches up uh there will be one
[00:34:20] out of a few million that Mak some money
[00:34:22] but they always give it back to the
[00:34:23] casino so just you know have patience
[00:34:25] you'll see what see how that works and
[00:34:27] and then the temperament is the ability
[00:34:29] to drown out noise a gentleman asked me
[00:34:31] earlier today like don't you watch your
[00:34:33] portfolio you've got tariffs today and
[00:34:35] all that stuff and the answer is I know
[00:34:39] the price that we're getting out of a
[00:34:41] company before we even get into a
[00:34:43] company because I've looked under the
[00:34:44] hood and done the fundamental analysis
[00:34:46] and we're going to talk about some
[00:34:47] things to take advantage of that um we
[00:34:52] we started to cover VF Corp I wanted to
[00:34:54] cover a few names with you here
[00:34:58] um that's Brack and Daryl by the way and
[00:35:01] he did a couple of things straight out
[00:35:02] of the gate number one is he took
[00:35:06] bankruptcy risk or solvency risk off the
[00:35:08] table the minute he came in and he sold
[00:35:11] off the Supreme brand okay is a supreme
[00:35:14] Grand going up or going
[00:35:16] down down okay so he sold it for 1.5
[00:35:19] billion he sold it to pay off debt and
[00:35:22] now there solvency risk is no longer off
[00:35:24] the table he can focus on turning around
[00:35:26] Vans which is improving sequentially the
[00:35:29] Improvement starts in Europe it starts
[00:35:31] in Asia and then eventually it'll get to
[00:35:32] the US watch
[00:35:35] uh within one to one and a half years
[00:35:39] I'll bet when I ask who's wearing Vans
[00:35:42] probably a third of this room is going
[00:35:43] to raise their hands again it's going to
[00:35:45] be like 2000 when did you all own Vans
[00:35:47] 2021 2020 is that basically when they
[00:35:50] were hot
[00:35:54] yeah
[00:35:56] 1982 that's a durable brand
[00:36:02] yeah yeah and they still got the
[00:36:04] building there on the highway I see when
[00:36:06] I drive the girls to Irvine to swim um
[00:36:09] so that's a big thing uh North Face is a
[00:36:11] no-brainer everyone wears North Face
[00:36:13] it's huge in Asia and by the way they're
[00:36:15] going to benefit immensely from the
[00:36:16] turnaround in Asia okay as China comes
[00:36:19] back which is starting to a lot of
[00:36:21] stimulus over the past uh two years in
[00:36:24] fits and starts and now it's all
[00:36:26] starting to come together um so we think
[00:36:28] this can you know short-term
[00:36:30] conservatively probably move up from you
[00:36:32] know it's moved up from 15 or 13 to uh
[00:36:36] 27 we think it goes to 40 and then from
[00:36:39] there we'll look and see how the
[00:36:40] execution is what the fundamentals look
[00:36:42] like but I was listening to Bracken
[00:36:44] after last week's earnings and uh I
[00:36:48] think he's going to run this thing back
[00:36:49] up to new highs and it's going to take a
[00:36:50] few years and he's going to build an
[00:36:52] incredible franchise and he's an
[00:36:53] incredible leader uh second one Alibaba
[00:36:57] has anyone ever heard of this
[00:37:00] company oh a lot of you okay good so uh
[00:37:05] Alibaba is basically the Amazon of
[00:37:07] China and the most important thing you
[00:37:10] need to know about this because we're
[00:37:11] going to want to open for what about 30
[00:37:12] minutes for questions is
[00:37:18] that yeah okay great
[00:37:21] great what do you guys like lectures or
[00:37:25] questions questions okay good so so
[00:37:30] lecture
[00:37:31] questions all right hands up if you like
[00:37:35] questions hands up if you like
[00:37:39] lectures and the rest of you are
[00:37:41] probably in the lecture Camp because
[00:37:42] you're sleeping now
[00:37:44] kidding all right so this is a perfect
[00:37:48] example of prices what you pay values
[00:37:50] what you get so during The covid Surge
[00:37:53] the stock hit uh just over
[00:37:55] $320 per share
[00:37:58] and postco it dropped down to about $58
[00:38:02] a share okay so more than you know how
[00:38:06] much of a drop is that all the math
[00:38:07] wizzes in here 320 down to
[00:38:11] 58 you can ballpark it if you
[00:38:15] want all
[00:38:17] [Music]
[00:38:18] right all right let's call it over 80%
[00:38:21] we love we love the 80 round number um
[00:38:24] so it's like why would the price drop
[00:38:28] 80% I mean if you saw this stock price
[00:38:30] if you saw this stock chart and someone
[00:38:31] Saidi got a great stock for you and you
[00:38:33] looked at the chart what would you say
[00:38:34] to them I mean the thing is Fallen it
[00:38:36] looks like it's gone out of business is
[00:38:37] that
[00:38:39] correct okay you think most people if
[00:38:42] you walk down the street and show them
[00:38:44] this
[00:38:44] chart would say yeah that's a stock I
[00:38:47] want to
[00:38:48] buy no okay so let's talk about what's
[00:38:52] happened in terms of financials over
[00:38:54] that time period if you look back the
[00:38:57] company ipoed in
[00:38:59] 2014 back at around these prices it was
[00:39:02] around $88 so that's all the way on the
[00:39:04] left side of the chart as you guys are
[00:39:06] looking at
[00:39:07] it since then price is basically around
[00:39:11] the same it's it started to rebound off
[00:39:13] the bottom it's up about it's around
[00:39:15] $100 now but it's basically trading for
[00:39:17] the same price as it did 10 years
[00:39:20] ago the difference is revenues are up
[00:39:25] close to now 10x or a
[00:39:30] th% earnings in cash flow are up about
[00:39:34] 6X or 600% so you're getting 600% more
[00:39:39] free cash flow and all that really means
[00:39:41] is money left to you as the owner of the
[00:39:43] business because if you own one share of
[00:39:45] a company you are an owner of the
[00:39:48] business um for the same price and these
[00:39:52] type of divergences between intrinsic
[00:39:55] value and price are where fortunes are
[00:39:58] made there's no other sure way in my
[00:40:00] view uh candidly to make insane amounts
[00:40:04] of money than buying high quality assets
[00:40:07] when they're temporarily out of favor
[00:40:09] there's there's nothing like it like if
[00:40:11] if you were to walk into the board of
[00:40:14] this company and say I will buy the
[00:40:17] entire company at the price that it is
[00:40:20] quoted in the public markets today I'm
[00:40:23] financed by JP Morgan and I'll put up
[00:40:25] some equity on my own
[00:40:27] uh will you sell me the company they
[00:40:30] would call security and have you removed
[00:40:32] from the building because they would
[00:40:33] think you were absolutely lost your mind
[00:40:36] they would think you're crazy and yet
[00:40:37] every single day in the public markets
[00:40:40] prices react so extreme to the
[00:40:43] short-term headlines to the short-term
[00:40:45] noise to the short-term fashion show
[00:40:49] okay like certain clothes go in favor
[00:40:51] out of favor certain stocks go in favor
[00:40:54] and out of favor unrelated to the
[00:40:56] underlying fundamental so if you don't
[00:40:58] wear vans
[00:40:59] today forget about the fashion because
[00:41:01] no influencers are are ramped up yet
[00:41:03] we'll get the influencers going it's
[00:41:05] going to happen in about 12 months uh do
[00:41:08] you think the quality of the van's
[00:41:10] product is
[00:41:11] good like when you wear it is it durable
[00:41:14] does it or is it garbage and it falls
[00:41:16] apart it's durable right it's a good
[00:41:18] quality thing it's a reasonable price
[00:41:20] it's just temporarily out of favor
[00:41:22] that's that's what the sneaker is it's
[00:41:24] the same thing that's happening with the
[00:41:26] stock and then all the sudden you're
[00:41:27] going to see in nine months 12 months uh
[00:41:31] my girls are 10 and 12 let's see Sabrina
[00:41:34] Carpenter is going to put on a pair of
[00:41:35] Vans and half of this room is gonna buy
[00:41:38] a pair of Vans she won a Grammy last
[00:41:39] night right that you guys watch the you
[00:41:43] guys only do statistics up
[00:41:45] here all right good
[00:41:47] stuff all right so Alibaba is
[00:41:51] basically
[00:41:53] the Amazon of
[00:41:56] China and
[00:41:58] and it's effectively an AI ETF in China
[00:42:03] so if you want to own a piece of every
[00:42:05] single AI startup in China you want to
[00:42:08] own Alibaba why because they give
[00:42:11] startups compute power they give them
[00:42:14] cloud services for free tokens in
[00:42:17] exchange for equity in their company and
[00:42:19] most people aren't aware of this so it's
[00:42:21] not priced yet into the stock but when
[00:42:23] you uh see things like uh quen 2. their
[00:42:27] model actually beat deep seek they put
[00:42:29] out the data last week that's why the
[00:42:31] stock is up that's why it's just getting
[00:42:32] started so uh any of you play
[00:42:36] poker yeah so a lot of you good so in
[00:42:39] poker there's something known as out
[00:42:41] okay and in Alibaba we have a lot of
[00:42:44] outs number one it's the number one
[00:42:46] cloud provider in China number two it's
[00:42:48] the number one retailer to the middle
[00:42:50] class so in the last two years when the
[00:42:52] economy was down who did well the
[00:42:54] companies like Teemu selling the cheap
[00:42:56] junk that no one really cares you buy it
[00:42:58] all and then you never use it and you
[00:42:59] put it under your bed um Alibaba caters
[00:43:02] to the middle class and the upper class
[00:43:04] the higher-end luxury brands are all on
[00:43:06] alibaba's platforms uh you have tbow you
[00:43:09] have t-all international businesses
[00:43:11] growing 30 40% uh like a weed and their
[00:43:16] AI model is faster than open AI it's
[00:43:19] faster than deep seek and it's just
[00:43:20] beginning and you can buy it at five six
[00:43:22] seven times earnings which it's uh
[00:43:25] historic normalized multiple is like 25
[00:43:27] to 30 times when it gets back into the
[00:43:29] fashion show and people get excited and
[00:43:31] Sabrina Carpenter starts wearing Vans
[00:43:33] and all that stuff so that's these are
[00:43:36] the type of things so this
[00:43:37] one um it's trading at about $220
[00:43:40] billion market cap it's got 7080 billion
[00:43:43] dollar of cash and five six seven times
[00:43:46] earnings that doesn't exist you compare
[00:43:48] that to something like Nvidia is trading
[00:43:50] at
[00:43:52] uh 50 times
[00:43:54] earnings so price is what you pay values
[00:43:57] what you get you can pay a lower
[00:43:58] multiple for more earnings with
[00:43:59] something like Alibaba or you can chase
[00:44:01] the shiny object and get your face
[00:44:03] ripped out like uh nvidia's down 24% in
[00:44:06] the last few weeks since deep
[00:44:08] sea
[00:44:10] um couple tips anyone looking to get
[00:44:13] into the investment business hedge fund
[00:44:15] World
[00:44:16] okay about 10 20 of you okay so I would
[00:44:20] say a couple of things
[00:44:22] um NBA can help I think CFA is more
[00:44:25] important if that's what if that's the
[00:44:27] route you want to go um I think
[00:44:30] certainly statistics background is
[00:44:31] useful you got to have math you got to
[00:44:33] have accounting Finance economics we've
[00:44:36] got basically all those teachers in here
[00:44:39] um and for
[00:44:42] me I would say part of the reason that
[00:44:45] I'm here doing this speech is because a
[00:44:48] guy named Warren Buffett was generous
[00:44:49] enough to share his ideas uh and uh if
[00:44:53] if he wasn't so generous with the
[00:44:55] population and sharing his ideas is I
[00:44:57] wouldn't have a career and I've been
[00:44:59] able to build an amazing life uh for my
[00:45:02] family for myself for my clients as a
[00:45:05] result of the
[00:45:06] principles that he taught and the
[00:45:09] principles that he learned from a
[00:45:10] gentleman named Ben Graham who wrote the
[00:45:12] book The intelligent investor and my
[00:45:14] best suggestion to everyone in this room
[00:45:17] is read the book The intelligent
[00:45:19] investor by Benjamin Graham and one of
[00:45:21] two things is going to happen either one
[00:45:24] a light bulb is going to go off and it's
[00:45:26] going to change your life and you're
[00:45:27] going to go on to become an incredible
[00:45:28] investor over time make all your dreams
[00:45:31] come true or number two you're going to
[00:45:32] say I don't really understand what that
[00:45:35] Ben Graham was talking about in 1923 or
[00:45:37] whenever he wrote the book I'm not
[00:45:39] interested and then you're going to go
[00:45:40] off and become an entrepreneur and
[00:45:42] create things that are going to change
[00:45:43] the world um and uh either way is a
[00:45:47] great path I I very grateful for the
[00:45:49] path that I got into partially by
[00:45:51] accident and I hope that makes a
[00:45:53] difference but I
[00:45:55] think uh that's one way to kind of get
[00:45:57] some education if what you read in that
[00:46:01] book set a light off I would suggest you
[00:46:04] read every single annual letter Warren
[00:46:07] Buffett has written since he started
[00:46:09] managing money in the 50s and those
[00:46:12] lessons and I've done that
[00:46:15] um will
[00:46:18] absolutely almost guarantee that you
[00:46:20] will be a successful investor over time
[00:46:23] uh because no one does it you'd be
[00:46:24] amazed the amount of money that's
[00:46:26] managed by people that don't know basic
[00:46:27] fundamentals and basic principles that
[00:46:30] uh Ben Graham started Warren Buffett uh
[00:46:33] implemented and uh
[00:46:35] few I mean there's
[00:46:38] probably couple hundred people around
[00:46:40] the world that Implement those
[00:46:41] principles well and uh you know who they
[00:46:44] are uh by their results so with that
[00:46:49] said let's open it up for some
[00:46:53] Q&A
[00:46:55] okay have a question come on down okay
[00:47:00] over
[00:47:12] here okay here we go this will be
[00:47:15] good I'm a little
[00:47:24] nervous yeah
[00:47:32] yeah yeah I think that's a great
[00:47:33] question by the way give her a
[00:47:35] hand
[00:47:38] um I think the number one thing you can
[00:47:40] do at any age if you're just getting
[00:47:43] started investing is decide every single
[00:47:46] month that you're going to pay yourself
[00:47:48] first and you're going to set aside uh
[00:47:51] you know whatever it is200 $400 $500 a
[00:47:55] month and buy the S&P index Index Fund
[00:47:57] or the vti Vanguard all Market ETF low
[00:48:01] cost it'll give you exposure to the top
[00:48:03] 500 stocks and just do it every month
[00:48:05] because when when the Market's High you
[00:48:07] will buy less shares automatically when
[00:48:09] the Market's low you will buy more
[00:48:11] shares because it's the same amount of
[00:48:12] money and that will compound over time
[00:48:14] and then that gives you the runway and
[00:48:17] the security of savings where you can
[00:48:19] start to learn about individual stocks
[00:48:21] and maybe start to outperform over time
[00:48:23] as you enjoy that but that's probably
[00:48:25] the best advice I would give
[00:48:27] uh although it's all opinion not
[00:48:30] advice how much money do you make uh I
[00:48:34] will
[00:48:36] say
[00:48:38] uh I I will say first off it's a
[00:48:41] reasonable question it's the wrong
[00:48:44] question how no so the right question is
[00:48:48] how much are you
[00:48:49] worth okay
[00:48:53] so how many of you have read the book
[00:48:56] Rich Dad Poor Dad by ro Robert
[00:49:00] kosaki okay that's a life-changing book
[00:49:02] that's that's a book that you all need
[00:49:04] to read Because I grew up poor like
[00:49:06] lower middle class when I was 10 years
[00:49:09] old I was I had a paper route you don't
[00:49:11] even know what that means but you like
[00:49:13] delivered these physical things called
[00:49:14] newspapers to people's doors and asked
[00:49:17] them for money uh I was a
[00:49:20] dishwasher from 11 to 12 I was a golf
[00:49:23] caddy from 12 to 17 and when you grow up
[00:49:25] poor the only thing you think about is
[00:49:29] uh how much money can I make so I can
[00:49:31] buy some piece of bling or this or that
[00:49:34] once you get rich and
[00:49:37] you uh have done that then all you think
[00:49:39] about is what assets can I buy that
[00:49:41] generate more cash that continue to
[00:49:44] build more wealth etc etc etc so you're
[00:49:46] thinking less about ordinary income and
[00:49:49] you're thinking more about Investments
[00:49:50] That generate cash that can pay for
[00:49:53] everything that you want over time so uh
[00:49:55] I'll I'll leave it at this
[00:49:57] um it's beyond anything I could have
[00:49:59] possibly ever imagined uh I didn't plan
[00:50:02] it uh I was always ambitious I was
[00:50:05] always willing to do the work but um I
[00:50:08] think the best answer is I make 75% less
[00:50:13] than my than than my clients make
[00:50:16] because in order for me to get paid I
[00:50:17] got they've got to make money and the
[00:50:19] way my business is set up is if they
[00:50:22] don't make money in a given year how
[00:50:24] much do you think I make
[00:50:28] zero we have no management fee zero only
[00:50:32] performance fee uh and we set it up that
[00:50:35] way because we simply copied what Warren
[00:50:37] Buffett did when he was managing outside
[00:50:39] money uh we don't believe we should get
[00:50:42] paid for watching people's money we
[00:50:43] believe we should get paid for results
[00:50:45] and once you think
[00:50:47] about how much value can I deliver to
[00:50:49] other people you will get more money
[00:50:52] than you could ever possibly imagine uh
[00:50:54] so whoever asked that question and it's
[00:50:56] and it's a good question and um and the
[00:51:00] other thing is you'll get to a
[00:51:02] point when you don't have to work
[00:51:06] anymore um then it's one it's about
[00:51:10] Freedom two it's about making a
[00:51:12] contribution and three if you're an
[00:51:14] athlete it's honestly about competing
[00:51:16] and winning like there's there's a real
[00:51:18] joy in doing the best work you are
[00:51:20] humanly capable of and I
[00:51:23] hope you maybe have that a little bit in
[00:51:25] your school studies right now it's not
[00:51:28] just like I got to get good grades to
[00:51:29] get a good job to make my parents happy
[00:51:31] it's like no let me see what is the best
[00:51:33] I can possibly do given the genetic
[00:51:37] Lottery that you won to be here in
[00:51:38] beautiful Southern California I mean you
[00:51:40] could have been born in Bangladesh with
[00:51:42] no food and no water right instead you
[00:51:45] got Bor somehow you were born in sunny
[00:51:47] beautiful California in America with a
[00:51:50] beautiful school with teachers that care
[00:51:52] about you enough to call this guy for
[00:51:54] three months to say come speak to my
[00:51:55] students
[00:51:57] uh we don't realize how lucky we have it
[00:52:00] to be born where we are and have the
[00:52:02] opportunity so
[00:52:05] um a lot all right
[00:52:15] go uh first thing is statman of course I
[00:52:18] follow statman who doesn't follow
[00:52:19] statman everyone follows
[00:52:21] that what was the second question was
[00:52:25] one and what do you you think about is
[00:52:27] Tik
[00:52:28] Tok I'm I'm still trying to understand
[00:52:31] lessons uh you know one of these days
[00:52:33] I'm going to understand statistics so
[00:52:35] well I can really make some money but
[00:52:36] for now I I'm learning every single week
[00:52:39] I listen to his lesson so next question
[00:52:42] um how big is your
[00:52:46] house which one
[00:52:58] [Music]
[00:53:03] you said you didn't come from
[00:53:10] a
[00:53:13] um what you lack in capital you can make
[00:53:16] up in labor so what I decided at 10
[00:53:19] years old I was just going to outwork
[00:53:21] everyone around me I mean the one thing
[00:53:22] that my parents did right and they did
[00:53:24] many things right was believed in
[00:53:27] education and uh they pushed me to go
[00:53:30] school even though I didn't want to but
[00:53:31] everything that I wanted to do for
[00:53:33] myself I had to earn and I would just
[00:53:35] Embrace work uh I I think being a golf
[00:53:38] caddy was the best thing that ever
[00:53:39] happened to me because I realized that a
[00:53:42] very young age I never ever want to have
[00:53:44] to do manual labor I want to get paid
[00:53:46] for my mind and I learned that at a very
[00:53:47] young age and a lot of people Coast
[00:53:49] through the cool kids in school and all
[00:53:52] that stuff and the uh you'll be shocked
[00:53:56] all the people that
[00:53:59] uh you think are going to be the stars
[00:54:01] of of real life that are the stars right
[00:54:04] now are going to be working for you so
[00:54:09] when when you know when people are tough
[00:54:13] on you and Etc just use it as motivation
[00:54:15] to work harder become better pursue your
[00:54:18] dreams and no matter how many
[00:54:20] times you get kicked in the face and you
[00:54:23] fall down get back up one more time
[00:54:27] good
[00:54:30] [Applause]
[00:54:33] question can you explain the differ
[00:54:36] between momentum investing and turn
[00:54:39] around investing what's the second one
[00:54:41] turn around investing yeah that's a
[00:54:43] great question uh you tried to cover it
[00:54:46] a little bit so momentum is kind of
[00:54:48] chasing things where the price has gone
[00:54:49] up a lot not necessarily grounded in
[00:54:51] fundamentals often times you know high
[00:54:53] price of sales multiple earning little
[00:54:56] to no money but everyone thinks it's
[00:54:57] going to be the next big thing by the
[00:55:00] way amazon.com in
[00:55:04] 2000 um was trading similar to like how
[00:55:09] in Nvidia was today everything that
[00:55:11] people thought Amazon was going to do it
[00:55:13] actually did the problem was in
[00:55:17] 2000 you were already
[00:55:20] paying the price for what would happen
[00:55:23] eventually 15 years later you know on
[00:55:26] and app stuff comes to your house the
[00:55:27] next day or if you're downtown huntingt
[00:55:29] and Beach it comes to you that day or in
[00:55:31] like an hour it's crazy uh the cloud
[00:55:33] computing all those things so what
[00:55:35] happened the stock ran up because all
[00:55:37] these great things were going to be
[00:55:38] happening everyone was right all the
[00:55:41] great things happened from Amazon
[00:55:42] everything we thought they could do they
[00:55:44] did and more the difference was they got
[00:55:47] too excited too early the stock fell
[00:55:50] 92% from 2000 to 2003 even though the
[00:55:55] fundamentals of the business were
[00:55:56] improving very similar to what's
[00:55:58] happening with Alibaba now before they
[00:56:00] recovered and went on to do great things
[00:56:01] so uh you can be right about the
[00:56:04] narrative but if you pay too much for an
[00:56:06] asset you're going to get hurt and uh so
[00:56:09] what we try to do is take the opposite
[00:56:12] side invert like Charlie Munger says and
[00:56:14] say well if that's gonna if that's
[00:56:16] what's going to hurt you the most in
[00:56:17] business what's going to help you the
[00:56:19] most is buying a great quality asset
[00:56:21] when no one wants it and then riding it
[00:56:23] back up and that's that's what we try to
[00:56:25] do and play the mean revers over time
[00:56:28] great
[00:56:30] question what was the biggest in your
[00:56:32] career when youer biggest what a biggest
[00:56:35] break in your career oh biggest
[00:56:40] break
[00:56:46] uh probably meeting well I think the
[00:56:49] biggest break in my life was
[00:56:51] uh probably uh marrying the right
[00:56:54] woman yeah
[00:56:58] yeah cuz
[00:57:02] um that's that's probably the most
[00:57:04] important decision you'll make in your
[00:57:05] life by the way because I was willing to
[00:57:07] take risk and she was never like oh if
[00:57:09] we do that what if we lose this what if
[00:57:11] we lose that she was always like try it
[00:57:12] we'll figure it out try it we'll figure
[00:57:14] it out so I never had that like nagging
[00:57:16] like what if this what if that she was
[00:57:18] always just willing to be like let's
[00:57:19] let's go for it and I think that's
[00:57:22] number one pick the right partner uh
[00:57:26] I would say my first hedge fund boss was
[00:57:28] you know taking me into that value Mafia
[00:57:30] World bringing me around to the meetings
[00:57:32] the hedge fund lunches with Lee
[00:57:34] cooperman and Mario gabelli and the
[00:57:36] annual meetings with Warren Buffett that
[00:57:38] was lifechanging and kind of just
[00:57:40] learning by immersion he never really
[00:57:43] sat me down and said learn this learn I
[00:57:45] I learned by immersion and I had to
[00:57:47] self-generate the motivation because he
[00:57:49] was already very wealthy he didn't have
[00:57:51] the motivation to train an analyst and
[00:57:53] and everything else so I think that was
[00:57:55] a break I would say the other advice I
[00:57:58] would give that took me longer to
[00:58:01] learn
[00:58:03] was you know hard
[00:58:06] work uh and effort and persistence
[00:58:08] that's kind of and smarts that's kind of
[00:58:10] table Stakes if you want to perform at
[00:58:12] the highest levels the quantum leaps if
[00:58:14] I have to look
[00:58:16] back uh happen in the Social
[00:58:20] Circle and that's hard to understand so
[00:58:23] two things I would say about the Social
[00:58:25] Circle Number One
[00:58:26] is hang around with people who are
[00:58:28] better than you if you want to be a
[00:58:30] better golfer play with better golfers
[00:58:31] if you want to be smarter hang around
[00:58:33] with the smartest kids if you want to be
[00:58:34] faster swim with the fast I mean I'm in
[00:58:36] here in California because this is the
[00:58:39] best water polo in the world and my
[00:58:41] girls are serious about water polo and
[00:58:42] swimming so this is where they need to
[00:58:44] be they got to be around the fastest
[00:58:45] people because being number one in you
[00:58:48] know wherever that doesn't matter is not
[00:58:50] going to help them so I think you have
[00:58:53] to I'm I'm not social by Nature I once I
[00:58:56] realized that all the quantum leaps in
[00:58:58] my life came as a function of Social
[00:59:00] Circle um I forced myself to be in
[00:59:02] situations around people who are smarter
[00:59:05] than I am fast better golfers than I am
[00:59:07] wealthier than I am not not to climb
[00:59:10] it's just to become the best you can
[00:59:12] possibly be in whatever you're up to if
[00:59:14] you want to become a fashion designer
[00:59:16] don't hang around with people that have
[00:59:17] no fashion sense you know that that's
[00:59:19] really what it comes down to uh if you
[00:59:21] want to be a a fast track star run with
[00:59:25] the fastest kids so you feel like you're
[00:59:28] slow don't run with the slowest kids so
[00:59:29] you feel like you're a champion because
[00:59:31] you'll never get better that way
[00:59:34] [Applause]
[00:59:43] yeah that's hard uh I would
[00:59:47] say you know econ is a good major
[00:59:50] business undergradu is a good
[00:59:52] major um if you're going to go to
[00:59:55] Business School school I would go to if
[00:59:57] you want to get into this I'd either go
[00:59:59] to if you can get into Columbia or if
[01:00:01] you can get into Wharton for business
[01:00:04] school if you want to be an investor
[01:00:05] those are probably good places but
[01:00:07] honestly if you the
[01:00:10] CFA uh designation you can study on your
[01:00:13] own you probably have the books in your
[01:00:15] library and if you don't you can get
[01:00:16] them at the public library start to
[01:00:19] study for the CFA and educate yourself
[01:00:21] formal education will make you a living
[01:00:23] self-education will make you a fortune
[01:00:25] any anyone who's achieved things that
[01:00:27] you think you want in life uh they're
[01:00:32] exceptional yes they know the basics
[01:00:34] that you all learned in college but they
[01:00:35] developed an edge or a method or a way
[01:00:40] of doing things from experience and from
[01:00:41] selfstudy from self-learning on top of
[01:00:44] the basic learning that really push him
[01:00:46] ahead so yeah I've seen it I've seen
[01:00:48] everything you know it could be it could
[01:00:50] be English it could be history you learn
[01:00:52] how to write and communicate and then
[01:00:54] you take the CFA on the side and you
[01:00:56] develop skills and that type of thing
[01:00:58] but I would say accounting is the
[01:00:59] language of numbers very important I
[01:01:01] know there's an accounting teacher in
[01:01:02] the back uh econ business all fine have
[01:01:06] some statistics courses and that type of
[01:01:08] thing yeah thank you we got probably
[01:01:11] time for about one or two more
[01:01:13] okay how do you use AI your
[01:01:17] job good question
[01:01:20] um it's it's currently not at the level
[01:01:25] I wanted it when I ask it the questions
[01:01:28] I want it to
[01:01:30] answer uh but it will be and I'll use it
[01:01:32] more and more I mean for me the number
[01:01:34] one thing is I'm not interested in
[01:01:36] secondhand interpretations of analysis
[01:01:40] on the assets I'm looking at I want
[01:01:41] Source materials I want public company
[01:01:44] materials and I draw my own
[01:01:45] conclusions um and some of that comes
[01:01:47] from
[01:01:48] experience simple answer I need to get
[01:01:51] better uh second simple answer is so
[01:01:54] does the technology
[01:01:56] but yeah I'm going to explore that with
[01:01:58] you I mean right there tells you
[01:02:01] why the playing field is leveling and if
[01:02:05] you can Master some of these things you
[01:02:06] can disrupt uh things that have been in
[01:02:08] place for many many years so get after
[01:02:10] it you you'll do
[01:02:12] great okay last
[01:02:14] question um what Ro have
[01:02:18] relationship yeah this I learned later
[01:02:20] in life I think it's
[01:02:23] probably the most important thing you
[01:02:25] can do other than table Stakes learn the
[01:02:28] skills
[01:02:31] um and invest so I would spend a lot of
[01:02:34] time doing that and do it with people
[01:02:36] who make you grow and people who want to
[01:02:38] see you succeed and people who push you
[01:02:40] to be better and if you if you're
[01:02:43] focused on that I think the guy's the
[01:02:45] limit so yeah great question okay I want
[01:02:47] to thank a couple people Mr Gold
[01:02:50] Jennifer back there and Company back
[01:02:52] there thank you very much Mr and of
[01:02:54] course Mr
[01:02:57] thank
[01:03:03] you and we're back on to the data we've
[01:03:07] got a lot to cover this week uh first
[01:03:10] and foremost let's kick it off with this
[01:03:14] chart this is not really what you see at
[01:03:17] Market tops even though we are in
[01:03:19] February and February is the second
[01:03:21] weakest month of the year so just keep
[01:03:24] an eye on that the the
[01:03:28] global policy
[01:03:30] rate Cuts easing cycle has peaked at 62
[01:03:35] Cuts last year uh that is now going down
[01:03:38] but that doesn't mean that bad things
[01:03:40] happen to the market if anything that
[01:03:41] means that thing good things start to
[01:03:43] happen last time few times it peaked
[01:03:45] April 2009 May of 2000 those were really
[01:03:49] generational buys automotive sales
[01:03:52] volume again beat the last two years in
[01:03:55] j January down from December that
[01:03:57] happens every single year so that was
[01:03:58] good to see European stocks still trade
[01:04:01] at a much lower earnings multiple than
[01:04:03] their us peers people looking at this
[01:04:05] chart would say well that's the way it's
[01:04:08] always been but if you go back 30 years
[01:04:10] you will see that it International and
[01:04:13] US exceptionalism runs in normal
[01:04:16] cyclical Peaks and troughs just like
[01:04:18] value and growth and this time will be
[01:04:20] no
[01:04:24] different Trump's tariff plans would
[01:04:26] bring rates to highest in decades so if
[01:04:31] all of the US Mexico and Canada kick in
[01:04:35] it would take us back to not holy Smoot
[01:04:38] levels but those levels in early 2020 uh
[01:04:43] excuse me those levels in early like
[01:04:46] 1920 and then you had another eight
[01:04:48] years of robust economic growth until
[01:04:50] Holly Smoot uh at the end of the 20s
[01:04:54] early 30s which most people attribute to
[01:04:56] the Great Depression but we were raising
[01:04:58] tariffs for 12 years beforehand and had
[01:05:01] a period of excess Prosperity so I don't
[01:05:05] think all of these will hold so
[01:05:07] therefore I don't even think we're going
[01:05:09] up to the levels that preceded a decade
[01:05:11] of prosperity but uh we know which
[01:05:13] direction we are going is up off of
[01:05:16] historically um many Century low
[01:05:20] levels European Banks and secular bull
[01:05:23] this is interesting that shows some of
[01:05:25] the value trade in Europe starting to
[01:05:27] take off European value stocks
[01:05:29] outperforming growth
[01:05:31] stocks um us uh Europe growth versus
[01:05:34] value rolling over uh this tends to you
[01:05:38] know that's interesting because they
[01:05:40] rolled over in the same way in 20201
[01:05:43] ahead of us growth uh rolling over value
[01:05:46] we've been talking about this for a long
[01:05:47] time it's now starting to move toward a
[01:05:51] consensus point of view we and the
[01:05:53] listeners here were ahead of the Curve
[01:05:55] on that new orders inventories pointing
[01:05:58] to upside in global pmis manufacturing
[01:06:01] recovery we talked about with Stu
[01:06:03] exceptional us growth driven by
[01:06:05] exceptional government spending that is
[01:06:08] going down ladies and gentlemen if you
[01:06:10] haven't been paying attention to Doge
[01:06:12] follow Elon Musk on X and you can see
[01:06:16] example after example of
[01:06:19] egregious
[01:06:21] um waste of taxpayers dollars it's it's
[01:06:25] uh it's really disgusting what what had
[01:06:28] been going on and it's good that it's
[01:06:30] getting cleaned up it's going to be good
[01:06:31] for Bon yields it's going to be good for
[01:06:33] the country uh it's it's going to be
[01:06:36] good all around meanwhile intelligent
[01:06:40] bull investor bull bear ratio remained
[01:06:42] relatively
[01:06:44] low bullish for stocks that's from yard
[01:06:46] Denny your
[01:06:48] investment ah this is funny this is in a
[01:06:50] meeting between Jeff Bezos and Warren
[01:06:53] Buffett Jeff Bezos asked Warren Buffett
[01:06:55] your investment thesis is so simple
[01:06:57] you're one of the richest guys in the
[01:06:58] world and it's so simple why doesn't
[01:07:00] everyone just copy you and barn Buffett
[01:07:03] responds quote because no one wants to
[01:07:05] get rich slowly and um so there you go
[01:07:09] and there are a few of us that are that
[01:07:11] have copied and added our own twist and
[01:07:13] everything else and as you can tell
[01:07:15] Works quite well uh a positive January
[01:07:18] is a good thing for 20124 this is from
[01:07:20] Dietrich over at Carson uh negative
[01:07:23] January is tend to end up negative for
[01:07:25] the year with a negative 1.8 positive
[01:07:28] January the average tends to be 16.8%
[01:07:32] going all the way back to 1950 we're not
[01:07:34] that optimistic we think AG at 12 this
[01:07:36] year but you know we'll take it uh if it
[01:07:38] comes I think flows here this is showing
[01:07:41] flow of funds that tends to peek out mid
[01:07:43] mid-February the last two weeks of
[01:07:45] February tends to be bumpy so buckle up
[01:07:48] buttercup uh moving on economic policy
[01:07:51] uncertainty has soared so that's what
[01:07:54] you see when in 2001 which we continue
[01:07:58] to reference as a good great analog for
[01:08:01] a lot of the things that we're doing and
[01:08:02] then in May 2020 which was just an
[01:08:05] unbelievable year for us so uh we love
[01:08:09] conditions like this this is uh makes a
[01:08:11] smile so wide we could eat a banana
[01:08:13] sideways earnings growth as a friendly
[01:08:16] Public Service Announcement ladies and
[01:08:17] gentlemen go where the earnings growth
[01:08:20] is and uh accelerating and that is where
[01:08:24] small cap dramatically more that
[01:08:27] followed by midcap followed by large cap
[01:08:30] the exact opposite of what's happened
[01:08:32] last year when mag 7 outperformed now
[01:08:36] Val value uh small cap midcap
[01:08:39] International is going to is already and
[01:08:42] will continue to
[01:08:43] outperform uh Industrials even better
[01:08:46] when PMI is less than 50 and Rising this
[01:08:48] is from fun Strat uh and this is the
[01:08:50] condition that we're in right now and
[01:08:52] shows how Industrials outperform these
[01:08:54] are the month return stats as you can
[01:08:56] see February is the second worst month
[01:08:59] of the year behind September and tends
[01:09:02] to be excessively weak uh early February
[01:09:05] like this week and then uh end of the
[01:09:07] month also here is TLT treasury bonds
[01:09:12] we've been saying bonds will get bid in
[01:09:13] 2025 that's already started to happen
[01:09:16] and you can see all the dumb money piled
[01:09:19] into short interest which is what they
[01:09:21] do at every single bottom right before
[01:09:24] big Bond rallies crowded trades a theme
[01:09:29] of what we like to
[01:09:31] cover uh this is the Goldman Sachs
[01:09:34] manufacturing survey tracker preds
[01:09:36] manufacturing ISM coming out of a 2year
[01:09:40] depression in manufacturing this is
[01:09:42] going to be a critical theme uh median
[01:09:45] 2E S&P 500 since 1950 as you can see
[01:09:49] here the second half of February second
[01:09:52] half of June second half of September
[01:09:56] uh tends to be ter and the first half
[01:09:59] tends to be okay in February so that is
[01:10:02] what it is um don't be surprised if
[01:10:06] indices are bad and many stocks we own
[01:10:10] are good I know that continues to be a
[01:10:13] contradiction but it continues to happen
[01:10:15] in real time uh January was phenomenal
[01:10:19] and I think we're going to see more of
[01:10:20] the same throughout the year people in
[01:10:23] passive uh overweight mag 7 without
[01:10:26] knowing it by owning the indices are
[01:10:27] going to be unhappy and people who have
[01:10:30] done work and bought great businesses
[01:10:32] that were marked down are going to be
[01:10:33] generationally happy uh and that's
[01:10:36] exciting so us share of global indices
[01:10:39] has risen recently but the earnings has
[01:10:41] not R risen commensurate to that and
[01:10:44] what happens like you saw in 2000 when
[01:10:46] it gets too far ahead and the earnings
[01:10:48] growth lags it catches up and that's
[01:10:51] going to be all the mag 7 coming back
[01:10:53] down to reality when everyone realizes
[01:10:55] the emperor has no close and all the cap
[01:10:58] backs has led to negative return on
[01:11:00] invested capital and decelerated
[01:11:02] earnings growth uh that's the bad news
[01:11:05] the good news is all the Miracles that
[01:11:07] we expect AI is going to do uh are going
[01:11:10] to happen they're going to one take a
[01:11:11] little longer than everyone expects and
[01:11:13] number
[01:11:14] two um you're already paying for all
[01:11:17] those Miracles that you expect so price
[01:11:20] is what you pay value what you get the
[01:11:21] good news is it's got to happen the bad
[01:11:23] news is you already paid for it and uh
[01:11:25] and that's why they're coming in and
[01:11:26] people are surprised until they're not
[01:11:28] corporate sentiment hits record highs
[01:11:31] Dow Jones 10year cycle as you could see
[01:11:33] on an average years that end in five
[01:11:35] tend to be one of the best years of the
[01:11:37] decade we'll see if that holds true this
[01:11:40] time as
[01:11:41] well
[01:11:43] uh this is interesting about the prices
[01:11:46] of goods the Tariff premium uh US states
[01:11:49] imposed tariffs on washing machines from
[01:11:51] February 2018 to 23 here's how it
[01:11:54] affected prices compared with overall
[01:11:55] inflation and appliances as a whole so
[01:12:00] they did
[01:12:02] initially
[01:12:04] uh they went up then they went down and
[01:12:09] on balance they have
[01:12:11] underperformed overall inflation and O
[01:12:14] and in line with overall appliances what
[01:12:16] they're saying is in the short term it's
[01:12:18] inflationary in the intermediate to long
[01:12:20] term it actually has no difference
[01:12:23] strong BuyBacks despite elevated rates
[01:12:24] in
[01:12:27] valuations uh growth is lagging value by
[01:12:30] 3 percentage points year to date that's
[01:12:32] good that's normal this is abnormal 19
[01:12:36] uh 2015 to
[01:12:38] 2023 is abnormal if you look back
[01:12:41] through the rest of history and then go
[01:12:43] all the way back to 1927 value
[01:12:45] outperforms growth by
[01:12:47] 4.4% per year we are moving back into
[01:12:49] that regime uh number of companies
[01:12:52] expressed optim optimism and this is the
[01:12:55] reason for the broadening I continue to
[01:12:57] remind you and to Enlighten new viewers
[01:13:01] the reason is magnificent 7even earnings
[01:13:04] growth is
[01:13:06] decelerating dark
[01:13:08] blue
[01:13:10] unmagnify components of the S&P 500
[01:13:13] earnings growth
[01:13:15] accelerating and you're paying half the
[01:13:17] multiple so price is what you pay value
[01:13:19] is what you
[01:13:20] get faster earnings growth for half the
[01:13:23] price that's where I want to be
[01:13:27] um covered this this is interesting the
[01:13:30] dollar Index is back to levels that
[01:13:32] killed tech stocks in 2000 I don't think
[01:13:35] this is a great chart but I do think
[01:13:36] it's worth noting and I'm not calling
[01:13:39] for this type of tech wreck that we saw
[01:13:40] in 2000 I am calling for an
[01:13:43] underperformance and we're already
[01:13:45] seeing it effectively since last July
[01:13:47] but certainly more pronounced in
[01:13:49] 2025 and I think this dollar is rolling
[01:13:51] over just like you saw in 2001 it will
[01:13:54] persist week which is going to help the
[01:13:56] small caps going to help the
[01:13:58] international going to help the value
[01:14:01] over growth as this dollar weekends and
[01:14:03] probably continue to create an
[01:14:06] environment where mag 7 will
[01:14:12] underperform February isn't a fan of
[01:14:14] postelection years negative 1.3% on
[01:14:18] average probably skewed towards the
[01:14:20] second half of the year here's from Seth
[01:14:22] golden the key to 2025 five in one all
[01:14:26] to relevant chart equal weighted S&P 500
[01:14:29] versus cap weighted Tech triple bottom
[01:14:33] he's showing here in this box uh speaks
[01:14:36] to broadening rally projects Magnificent
[01:14:39] Seven dominance fading suggests small
[01:14:41] mid unprofitable Tech Rising equal
[01:14:43] weight and down cap tier out performance
[01:14:46] I.E small cap midcap and what he's
[01:14:48] leaving out there because it's not
[01:14:50] reflected in the chart is international
[01:14:52] outperformance and we continue to be in
[01:14:54] that camp
[01:14:55] uh jobless claims ticking up this uh
[01:14:58] we'll see what happens tomorrow but
[01:15:00] signs are pointing towards a weaker jobs
[01:15:02] report tomorrow in which case we would
[01:15:04] see a continued bid in 10-year bonds I.E
[01:15:09] yields compress uh Trump and Bessant
[01:15:12] said as much they're not really going to
[01:15:13] be on top of the FED to cut because he's
[01:15:15] out next year anyway they're going to
[01:15:17] focus on bringing down the 10-year
[01:15:20] yield and they're going to do so
[01:15:23] obviously by cutting expenses with Doge
[01:15:25] giving the market confidence that
[01:15:26] spending is under control uh maybe being
[01:15:30] in the market buying I don't I don't I
[01:15:32] don't think so but uh because that is
[01:15:36] the rate that controls mortgage rates
[01:15:38] and which controls the housing market
[01:15:40] which is why they want to focus on that
[01:15:42] and and obviously refinancing the
[01:15:44] government debt and that's a critical
[01:15:48] Factor revision suggests more moderate
[01:15:51] us payrolls growth so that we haven't
[01:15:53] seen a revision this large
[01:15:55] since Obama in
[01:15:58] 2009 um volatility is the toll we pay to
[01:16:02] invest this is a very important chart
[01:16:03] from Ryan Dietrich over at
[01:16:05] Carson uh since
[01:16:07] 1928 various declines per year on
[01:16:10] average you are going to get
[01:16:14] 7.23% dips every single year in the
[01:16:18] indices you are going to get
[01:16:23] 3.45% correction
[01:16:25] every single
[01:16:29] year every 1.1 years you are going to
[01:16:32] get a 10% correction intra year these
[01:16:37] are normal this is the toll we pay to
[01:16:40] invest and get outsize returns above
[01:16:42] inflation over time 15% severe
[01:16:46] correction one every half uh I'm sorry
[01:16:50] half of uh half of one every single year
[01:16:53] so every two years you're going to get a
[01:16:55] 15% correction on average and every 3.5
[01:17:00] years you are going to get a
[01:17:03] 20% bare Market the good news is I think
[01:17:07] we pulled forward two of them since we
[01:17:09] had one in
[01:17:11] 20120 and we had a second one after the
[01:17:15] um technical recession in
[01:17:17] 2022 we had a 25% draw down so we had
[01:17:21] two of those in a period of three
[01:17:26] years basically two years
[01:17:30] um and you should get two of those every
[01:17:33] seven years so we pulled forward five
[01:17:36] years of 20% Corrections so you know
[01:17:38] something to keep in mind if you get too
[01:17:40] bearish on any given
[01:17:42] day here is Ryan Dietrich very strong
[01:17:46] January for stocks but be aware the
[01:17:48] first quarter of a postelection year
[01:17:49] usually isn't all that strong barely
[01:17:52] positive that's going back to 1950 so
[01:17:55] expect that volatility you could see a
[01:17:57] lot of those losses and volatility in
[01:17:59] the top seven stocks and even though the
[01:18:01] indices are down or flat seeing enormous
[01:18:04] great things happening with the UNM
[01:18:06] magnificent 493 and other groups we've
[01:18:08] been talking about and telling you to
[01:18:10] get position
[01:18:13] for or even better if you're a client
[01:18:16] positioning you for so a good start for
[01:18:19] 2025 could mean the bull continues
[01:18:22] average
[01:18:23] gain uh when you get a greater than 2%
[01:18:27] year-to-date return in January uh the
[01:18:30] final 11 months of the year on average
[01:18:32] tend to be up
[01:18:34] 8.1 I'm sorry
[01:18:36] 12.3% as opposed to the normal year of
[01:18:39] 8.1% uh and for the calendar year tends
[01:18:42] to be up
[01:18:44] 18.4% so we shall see extreme stress for
[01:18:49] the auto supply chain if tariffs last
[01:18:52] John Murphy estimates that auto prices
[01:18:53] would have to increase 33 00 on average
[01:18:55] to offset the proposed 25%
[01:18:58] tariffs uh imported from Canada would be
[01:19:01] more such prices would exacer the
[01:19:03] affordability challenges for the autoc
[01:19:05] consumer us typically Imports 78 light
[01:19:08] vehicles per year 4 million come from
[01:19:11] Canada and Mexico Etc so a lot of people
[01:19:15] have asked like is Cooper standard going
[01:19:18] to be hurt by this is Stanley Black and&
[01:19:21] Decker going to be hurt by this is
[01:19:23] Whirlpool going to be hurt by this yes
[01:19:25] yes and yes and yes it's probably mostly
[01:19:27] priced in at this point and the reason
[01:19:30] is is
[01:19:32] like people still need cars and washing
[01:19:35] machines and all this stuff all this is
[01:19:38] is a tax on the poor that's all
[01:19:40] inflation and price increases ever are
[01:19:42] so um you know it's it's like okay we're
[01:19:46] going to create an external Revenue
[01:19:49] Service and we're going to collect more
[01:19:50] money from tariffs so we can lower taxes
[01:19:54] okay okay great money is fungible so now
[01:19:58] what happens is the tariffs increase the
[01:20:01] cost of goods in the short term uh which
[01:20:03] is a tax on the poor and then you lower
[01:20:05] their taxes to offset it and make them
[01:20:07] think that they have uh lower taxes but
[01:20:10] in effect they have lower purchasing
[01:20:12] power which effectively is a wash so at
[01:20:14] the end of the
[01:20:16] day um there aren't many people signing
[01:20:19] up to manufacture Hammers and DeWalt
[01:20:22] chainsaws and uh uh ceing systems around
[01:20:25] the doors and the windows at $5 an hour
[01:20:28] in uh you know Detroit Michigan or
[01:20:32] Mississippi or any of those places so uh
[01:20:36] what's basically going to happen is it's
[01:20:38] going to be passed through to the
[01:20:39] customer and at a higher price because
[01:20:42] no one's going to set up shop and say oh
[01:20:44] Stanley is in trouble I'll just
[01:20:46] manufacture in the US and undercut them
[01:20:49] on price it's simply not going to happen
[01:20:51] even after the tariffs Stanley is still
[01:20:54] going to have have a competitive
[01:20:55] advantage and uh uh and the moat so all
[01:20:59] of this stuff is just noise to take you
[01:21:01] out of great companies that you own and
[01:21:04] many of you have fallen for it and I'm
[01:21:06] very sorry for you but we have used the
[01:21:08] opportunity to pick up some of those
[01:21:10] shares and we will continue to do so
[01:21:12] thank you very much uh this shows the US
[01:21:15] import many key goods from tariff hip
[01:21:18] Nations beer fruit vegetables distilled
[01:21:22] Spirits poultry I mean do you think
[01:21:23] people are going to not eat fruit and
[01:21:28] avocados and beer and vegetables because
[01:21:31] it's up an extra 25 cents at the end of
[01:21:34] the day they're going to eat what
[01:21:34] they're going to eat they can't get it
[01:21:36] anywhere else they're not going to get
[01:21:37] it cheaper no one's going to just stand
[01:21:38] up a plant in five minutes and say it's
[01:21:41] cheaper no tariff avocados it's just
[01:21:44] that's not the way it works uh top five
[01:21:47] imports from by value from Mexico
[01:21:49] vehicle parts that's just going to be
[01:21:51] across the board I think that's will be
[01:21:53] partially offset if the tariffs stay I
[01:21:56] mean at the end of the day Kevin hasset
[01:21:59] who's a member of the I think he's
[01:22:00] heading the National Economic Council
[01:22:02] under Trump came on and said this is
[01:22:04] different this is not a tariff War this
[01:22:08] is a drug war so as soon as the
[01:22:11] president of Mexico and Canada prime
[01:22:14] minister of Canada said we're going to
[01:22:15] send 10,000 troops to the border and
[01:22:17] stop fentol from coming in Trump backed
[01:22:20] off so I guess if they keep those troops
[01:22:22] there there's a decent chance that the
[01:22:25] uh tariffs will de be delayed for Canada
[01:22:27] and Mexico and the Chinese ones the
[01:22:29] market took it like a champ and uh uh
[01:22:33] and that's that I mean that that's
[01:22:34] really what it comes down to so select
[01:22:36] recent notes addressing tariffs on China
[01:22:38] Mexico and Canada more noise there this
[01:22:41] is interesting the a AI sentiment survey
[01:22:44] this turned somewhat bullish in my view
[01:22:47] because the retail investor got very
[01:22:50] bearish this week um maybe that comes
[01:22:53] down a little bit further but but um
[01:22:55] again this is not things you see really
[01:22:57] at tops you see it closer to Bottoms ISM
[01:23:00] Services was a little weaker than
[01:23:03] expected uh so servic is coming down
[01:23:06] goods coming back that's good for a lot
[01:23:07] of our positions 10-year government bond
[01:23:09] yield everyone said it was going to five
[01:23:11] we said nope not going to happen again
[01:23:14] just like we said back here and we're
[01:23:16] down to
[01:23:17] 442 headed much
[01:23:21] lower Japanese Yen starting to strin
[01:23:25] these are the things that we T to keep
[01:23:26] an eye on as the carry trade unwinds
[01:23:29] which means billions upon billions of
[01:23:31] free do free Yen that has been parked in
[01:23:34] mag 7 is coming out this is the story
[01:23:37] not deep seek it's the carry trade onwi
[01:23:40] and no one's paying attention to it and
[01:23:42] when you try to talk about it no one
[01:23:43] wants to hear about it so I don't talk
[01:23:45] about it but I just benefit from it uh
[01:23:47] Argentina vehicle sales year on year
[01:23:49] this is what happens when you get good
[01:23:50] government policy in place it turns
[01:23:53] around the country and and uh that's a
[01:23:55] positive thing for Latin American Auto
[01:23:57] Sales China's crude imports from the US
[01:24:00] elevated here so they basically put a
[01:24:02] tariff on themselves because they don't
[01:24:04] have any real natural resources of of
[01:24:06] size to sustain their population
[01:24:08] question is how much are they going to
[01:24:10] get from Russia uh and we'll see uh
[01:24:13] China's crude imports from Canada and
[01:24:15] Mexico so Canada has been the big
[01:24:17] beneficiary from this trade War as far
[01:24:19] as uh what looks like a continued Trend
[01:24:21] Canada will send uh China more money
[01:24:24] their their
[01:24:26] uh uh costs are a little bit higher
[01:24:29] because they have whatever it's called
[01:24:31] the
[01:24:32] dirtier harder to refine type stuff but
[01:24:35] anyway the point is uh and Mexico will
[01:24:37] be a small beneficiary of that as well
[01:24:40] International markets still trading at a
[01:24:41] discount to the US cheapest being
[01:24:43] emerging markets in China we're going to
[01:24:45] continue to take advantage of that here
[01:24:47] shows the uh data centers around the
[01:24:50] world
[01:24:51] 11,800 us has 5,400 of them
[01:24:55] China only has
[01:24:57] 449 so we've got a big lead there job
[01:25:00] openings coming down declined sharply in
[01:25:03] December to 7.6 million is probably in
[01:25:07] line with an expectation of a weaker
[01:25:09] jobs report tomorrow Japan wages grow by
[01:25:12] the most since 1997 helping boj rate
[01:25:16] path and Yen so yen is getting stronger
[01:25:18] rates are going up in Japan IE carry
[01:25:21] trade is unwinding mag 7 will continue
[01:25:23] to be Under Pressure so long as that
[01:25:25] Trend
[01:25:27] continues this time is different the
[01:25:29] Trump trade war in
[01:25:31] 2018 uh us represented 19% of China's
[01:25:35] total exports now it's down to 15% so
[01:25:38] doesn't hurt them as much they have less
[01:25:40] incentive to negotiate and they haven't
[01:25:43] they could basically destroy Apple in
[01:25:45] one Fell Swoop and it's already
[01:25:47] happening on its own their sales were
[01:25:48] down 11% they blamed it on not having uh
[01:25:52] uh AI which their AI product is crap
[01:25:55] right now it will get better but um
[01:25:58] preview of Coming Attractions and then
[01:26:00] they went after Google which has uh for
[01:26:03] an antitrust thing so they will take
[01:26:05] down and Europe will take down and all
[01:26:08] these guys will take down to the extent
[01:26:09] that Trump wants to do tariffs these
[01:26:12] bureaucratic bodies will just start to
[01:26:14] shake down the mag 7 for antitrust
[01:26:17] anti-monopoly and fines so that's how
[01:26:21] they will hit back we estimate that a 10
[01:26:24] percentage Point increase in US tariffs
[01:26:26] on Chinese good would weigh on China's
[01:26:28] real GDP by 50 basis points so last year
[01:26:31] they did 5.4% GDP growth we did
[01:26:34] 2.5 according to this if these tariffs
[01:26:37] sustain they'll be down to you know 50
[01:26:39] basis points less than estimates let's
[01:26:41] call it you know around
[01:26:44] 5% double our growth China's LNG imports
[01:26:48] from the US has uh accelerated and
[01:26:52] continues to accelerate so again these
[01:26:54] are not things that help uh drill baby
[01:26:57] drill so let's see if they get to a
[01:27:00] discussion I do think as much as Trump
[01:27:03] wants to
[01:27:04] see income from foreign tariffs I think
[01:27:08] he really wants to see an
[01:27:12] absolute um stop of any type of drugs
[01:27:16] fallowing across the border more than
[01:27:17] anything else and I think that's what
[01:27:19] ultimately he's going to get to save
[01:27:21] face book a huge win for the American
[01:27:23] people stopping the drug trade stopping
[01:27:26] the illegal immigration not getting much
[01:27:28] by way of
[01:27:29] tariffs but um and then uh in addition
[01:27:33] he will say okay we'll get rid of the
[01:27:36] tariffs but you're going to take a ton
[01:27:37] of our a you're going to take a ton of
[01:27:39] our LNG and most of them will say yes as
[01:27:43] they need it anyway so it's not in their
[01:27:45] interest to have tariffs on things that
[01:27:47] they need and um they will do that
[01:27:49] Google's revenue growth slows their
[01:27:52] cloud service missed
[01:27:54] expectations and their cap backs going
[01:27:56] from 60 to 75 billion with a negative
[01:27:59] return on invested Capital was not
[01:28:02] received as positive news
[01:28:04] anymore uh here is Morgan Stanley's
[01:28:07] estimates of the FED funds rate going
[01:28:10] down looks like about two cuts this year
[01:28:13] we agree with that then they're
[01:28:14] expecting another 100 basis points the
[01:28:16] year after we disagree that would imply
[01:28:18] a serious recession we do not think that
[01:28:20] is in the cards video is taking over
[01:28:24] over from text you can see YouTube
[01:28:25] continues to grow Tik Tok uh and the
[01:28:28] Facebooks and the Twitter's of the world
[01:28:30] are declining because they're not as
[01:28:31] focused on video Auto unit inventory
[01:28:35] level this is what I'm talking about
[01:28:37] when I
[01:28:38] say
[01:28:41] that yeah it may increase the cost uh if
[01:28:44] if he puts the tars back on which are
[01:28:46] now
[01:28:49] delayed may increase the cost of the car
[01:28:52] a few thousand bucks but the demand is
[01:28:54] still there and number one and number
[01:28:57] two the theme moving forward is going to
[01:29:00] be like houses it's going to be smaller
[01:29:02] cars as we've seen with the hybrids and
[01:29:05] uh the rav 4S and the Corollas and all
[01:29:08] that stuff versus the Escalades which
[01:29:09] was in
[01:29:11] 2020 uh and this has to get back up to a
[01:29:14] normalized level this is you know well
[01:29:17] below cash for clunker level before the
[01:29:19] last run so the man the demand here is
[01:29:22] just ramping up even if it's a few extra
[01:29:25] thousand bucks a car they'll just build
[01:29:27] smaller cheaper cars and yes that will
[01:29:30] hurt OEM margins it will not hurt as
[01:29:33] much the auto supplier margins to the
[01:29:37] same extent here's the North American
[01:29:40] SAR just like we saw January is always
[01:29:42] weak January is always weak January is
[01:29:45] always weak every single year January is
[01:29:48] always weak going all the way back
[01:29:51] January is always weak and then the back
[01:29:52] half of the year go goes the key is that
[01:29:54] it's going up year on
[01:29:57] year us trade balance with major
[01:30:00] Partners so you can see here uh in ch in
[01:30:03] 2016 which much bigger for China than it
[01:30:06] is now Euro Europe has a lot to lose
[01:30:09] with the trade War more than anyone else
[01:30:12] uh and same with Mexico and same with
[01:30:17] Canada you can see the top five Goods
[01:30:19] imported by value from Mexico vehicle
[01:30:22] parts trucks buses ET Etc special
[01:30:24] purpose Vehicles Canada is crude
[01:30:27] oil uh China is cell phones and
[01:30:31] computers analysts are slashing us
[01:30:34] earnings forecast we said this would be
[01:30:35] happening seasonally it happens this
[01:30:37] time of year every single year covered
[01:30:40] the record short interest in bonds the
[01:30:41] most crowded trade here's the 10day sum
[01:30:44] of the advanced decline ratio shows the
[01:30:47] health of the market the broadening of
[01:30:49] the market the greater participation
[01:30:52] here's consumer staples relative to the
[01:30:54] S&P 500 forward PE you haven't seen this
[01:30:57] low of a relative PE ratio for Staples
[01:31:00] uh than in 20120 and then going back to
[01:31:03] 2009 and then going back to 2001 I think
[01:31:06] there's going to be a lot of stuff
[01:31:07] happening as a matter of fact if you
[01:31:09] looked at the notes that we sent over
[01:31:11] for vanney on Wednesday we were going to
[01:31:14] pitch two defensive Staples uh or yield
[01:31:17] sensitive uh stocks that will benefit as
[01:31:20] bonds get bid and yields go lower that's
[01:31:22] Staples and that's reach so we had crown
[01:31:24] castle International and we had horel
[01:31:27] Foods the makers of spam
[01:31:30] Skippy uh all the type of protein foods
[01:31:33] you need to eat if you're on
[01:31:35] gp1s uh Apple Wood Bacon
[01:31:41] uh horl pepperoni Hormel
[01:31:44] chili uh spam okay all this incredible
[01:31:49] stuff so lot lot of Staples are going to
[01:31:52] get bid here no one's position for it
[01:31:54] that's going to be an
[01:31:55] opportunity equal weight to market cap
[01:31:57] weight this is another way of showing
[01:31:59] Seth Golden's chart
[01:32:02] here Tokyo food CPI year onye inflation
[01:32:07] is coming back in Earnest in Tokyo a lot
[01:32:10] of that related to input cost because
[01:32:12] they have no real natural resources and
[01:32:15] uh that's always been their problem
[01:32:17] along with demographics and population
[01:32:19] decline so this as this goes up the
[01:32:24] carry trade on wines which hurts mag 7
[01:32:27] Tokyo inflation hits the fastest Pace in
[01:32:29] a year supporting bog Vu to continue
[01:32:32] hiking here's the bond yield this all
[01:32:35] this means is carry trade unwind mag
[01:32:38] seven pressure over and over our base
[01:32:42] case remains that data centers could
[01:32:43] drive 3 to four billion cubic feet per
[01:32:46] day of natural gas demand growth by 2030
[01:32:49] we love it we love our com stock we
[01:32:51] still love our range resources and uh
[01:32:55] we'll continue to do so single stocks
[01:32:57] Trail the S&P 500 by the most since
[01:33:00] 1999 this was the period ladies and
[01:33:02] gentlemen to flip the switch where value
[01:33:04] dramatically outperformed growth for the
[01:33:07] next seven years International over uh
[01:33:10] domestic and small over large boom bus
[01:33:14] semiconductor cycle I wish this chart
[01:33:16] went back to
[01:33:18] 2000 but what it's showing here is the
[01:33:22] cycle is peaking for these highflying
[01:33:25] semiconductor stocks now starting to get
[01:33:27] smashed um world semiconductor sales
[01:33:30] year on-ear followed by Philadelphia
[01:33:32] Stock Exchange semiconductor index you
[01:33:34] can see that pointing down and that
[01:33:36] tends to follow quote we have got a lot
[01:33:38] of great quotes of the week so I want to
[01:33:39] cover these uh this is from Warren
[01:33:41] Buffett no matter how great the talent
[01:33:43] or effort some things just take time you
[01:33:46] can't produce a baby in one month by
[01:33:48] getting nine women pregnant okay and
[01:33:50] that's the that's the key with
[01:33:51] turnarounds once you do the solvent
[01:33:53] analysis you see they have the runway
[01:33:55] you know they have a durable moat then
[01:33:57] it's just a question of time before you
[01:33:59] get your doubles and triples and we play
[01:34:01] the time Arbitrage game that is one of
[01:34:04] our major edges long ago Ben Graham
[01:34:06] taught me that price is what you pay
[01:34:08] value is what you get whether we're
[01:34:09] talking about socks or stocks I like
[01:34:12] buying quality merchandise when it's
[01:34:13] marked down not crap from Teemu okay
[01:34:17] Benjamin Graham in the short run the
[01:34:20] market is a voting machine and I'm going
[01:34:22] to add based on on technicals based on
[01:34:26] price but in the long run it is a
[01:34:29] weighing machine based on fundamentals
[01:34:33] and underlying business growth and
[01:34:35] intrinsic value and then finally another
[01:34:38] classic from Charlie Munger a young man
[01:34:40] comes up to mosart and says with your
[01:34:42] help I want to compose Symphonies mosart
[01:34:44] looks at him a bit perplexed and says
[01:34:46] you're too young to be composing
[01:34:48] Symphonies the young man suddenly feels
[01:34:50] thrown off too young he quickly replies
[01:34:52] look you were doing Symphonies when you
[01:34:54] were 10 years of age well I'm 21 and
[01:34:58] mosart grins politely and says yes but I
[01:35:01] wasn't running around asking other
[01:35:03] people how to do it so there you go
[01:35:05] Charlie Monger classic uh on to the news
[01:35:08] of the week why Chinese Tech keeps
[01:35:10] surprising the West deep seek is the
[01:35:12] latest product from China to shock the
[01:35:13] US tech oligarch bro oligarchy uh and it
[01:35:18] won't be the last I think we did this to
[01:35:20] ourselves with the premature ideological
[01:35:23] sanctions we took a country that was
[01:35:26] dependent on us and now made them
[01:35:27] independent of us necessity is the
[01:35:30] mother of invention and we've unleashed
[01:35:31] the genie out of the bottle here so uh
[01:35:34] unintended consequence of bad
[01:35:36] ill-thought out knee-jerk policy not the
[01:35:39] first time won't be the last time
[01:35:41] alphabet tumbles as Cloud growth slows
[01:35:43] missing estimates we covered that UBS
[01:35:47] wealth reiterated it's 6600 Target for
[01:35:49] the S&P tariffs unlikely to be
[01:35:52] sustained us manufacturing activity
[01:35:54] expands for the first time since 2022
[01:35:57] this is a theme we've been talking about
[01:35:58] for months we would be coming out of the
[01:36:00] manufacturing depression and we are
[01:36:03] destock to restock here we go baby
[01:36:05] clients are positioned for this and
[01:36:06] benefiting Dollar General is no Walmart
[01:36:09] by the stock anyway I kind of like this
[01:36:10] one I keep looking at it haven't done it
[01:36:12] because we've got enough uh low-end
[01:36:14] retail with Advanced Auto Parts which is
[01:36:16] making a nice move by the way uh this is
[01:36:20] interesting it's so funny how they
[01:36:22] changed the head lines after the fact if
[01:36:25] the stock price goes up they say uh
[01:36:27] Intel turnaround happening despite no
[01:36:30] finding not finding a new CEO now it
[01:36:31] says Intel falls on disappointing first
[01:36:33] quarter revenue forecast so uh you can't
[01:36:36] make this stuff up these people blow
[01:36:38] with the wind like a tree but nothing
[01:36:40] this is just dead money until they
[01:36:41] announce a new CEO and we can see what
[01:36:43] the plan is uh but at the end of the day
[01:36:46] it's so cheap we continue to like it we
[01:36:48] continue to add and uh we're comfortable
[01:36:50] with that position don't count on the
[01:36:52] Magnificent Seven stocks competing their
[01:36:53] winning streak this year's these Wall
[01:36:56] Street gurus warn the the thing I love
[01:36:58] about Intel is now as we're seeing with
[01:37:00] uh deep seek you can outperform or
[01:37:04] perform in line with the advanced chips
[01:37:08] if you can get the inference right and
[01:37:12] uh the model correct and what I love
[01:37:16] about Intel is it is the it is the
[01:37:19] leader of inferior chips so I think the
[01:37:22] future belongs to to them I think the
[01:37:24] superior chips are going to have the
[01:37:26] harder time as all these startups start
[01:37:28] clamoring for inferior chips and uh
[01:37:31] Intel is the name of the game don't
[01:37:32] count on the Magnificent Seven stocks
[01:37:34] repeating their winning streak this year
[01:37:36] says the these Wall Street gurus
[01:37:39] worn uh we agree with that we've been
[01:37:42] saying it for two months plus Trump
[01:37:45] tariffs risk 29,000 price rise in us
[01:37:48] home building costs so that's another
[01:37:51] factor that has to be considered and why
[01:37:53] that probably will be less inclined to
[01:37:56] reinstitute those tariffs provided the
[01:37:58] president follows through on her promise
[01:38:00] to keep 10,000 troops at the border and
[01:38:02] drugs and illegal immigration out of our
[01:38:05] country and I think that uh that will be
[01:38:08] a good quidd Pro quot China retaliates
[01:38:11] against us tariff Trump G phone call
[01:38:15] expected we'll see what happens Estee
[01:38:17] louder to cut up to 7,000 jobs in
[01:38:19] corporate overhaul these are normal
[01:38:21] things you see in a turnaround the key
[01:38:24] is the family owns 38% of the stock
[01:38:26] they'll fix it just like the Walmart
[01:38:27] family they've not been doing this for
[01:38:29] five years they've been doing this for
[01:38:30] decades and they will continue to do it
[01:38:33] this is just a play on the Emerging
[01:38:34] Market middle class growth which is just
[01:38:37] beginning Trudeau Benz KN Canada will
[01:38:39] send 10,000 troops to the Border Nam
[01:38:42] fent andol Zar to delay Trump
[01:38:45] tariffs Alibaba offers deep seek on
[01:38:49] cloud service after Microsoft Amazon and
[01:38:55] Huawei uh also we talked about last week
[01:38:58] how their quen 2.5 is faster on all
[01:39:00] counts faster than open AI faster than
[01:39:03] deep seek so that's why the stock is up
[01:39:06] my guess is it takes a rest in February
[01:39:07] it's had a huge move from 58 to 100 uh
[01:39:11] so if you can get it in the low 90s or
[01:39:13] mid 90s probably the last opportunity I
[01:39:16] wouldn't hold my breath but I think you
[01:39:17] might get a look in the mid 90s for sure
[01:39:20] uh Trump's 2.0 trade war is
[01:39:22] fundamentally different from 1.0 we
[01:39:24] covered the reasons why let's cover here
[01:39:27] what is this here are all the ways Trump
[01:39:29] tariffs could hit stocks so Goldman was
[01:39:32] out on Monday we covered it with Stu
[01:39:35] basically saying it would affect if if
[01:39:37] they stay which right now they haven't
[01:39:39] uh it would lead to a 3% drop in
[01:39:42] earnings a 5% drop in the S&P 500 that
[01:39:44] was your worst case so when you see some
[01:39:46] stocks down a lot more than that it's
[01:39:48] it's uh great the beauty of the Trump
[01:39:52] tariffs in CH is that the DI
[01:39:56] Minimus uh exemption that timu and Sheen
[01:39:59] have been using to ship goods under $800
[01:40:02] into the US with no uh tariffs is now
[01:40:06] been closed and that you know people say
[01:40:09] well Alibaba has AliExpress but it's so
[01:40:12] small in comparison their growth is xus
[01:40:15] in Alibaba so what's beautiful is the
[01:40:19] cash machine from teu and Shen is now
[01:40:22] going to dry up up which is going to
[01:40:24] give Alibaba more relative strength uh
[01:40:27] in all the other areas which is which is
[01:40:30] great so I'm glad to see that uh on to
[01:40:32] the next PayPal earnings show refresh is
[01:40:35] working while the stock is dropping
[01:40:36] anyway and uh we covered that in the
[01:40:39] article this week we'll get to that in a
[01:40:41] second again sandbagger and chief Alex
[01:40:43] Chris is setting expectations low to
[01:40:46] absolutely crush it once again oh and by
[01:40:48] the way he said we're going to buy back
[01:40:50] $15 billion of stock uh and for those of
[01:40:54] you wondering what does that mean in
[01:40:55] English $15 billion of stock is
[01:41:00] about give or
[01:41:04] take 77 billion do so uh 20% of the
[01:41:10] company and the stock is down so you
[01:41:12] can't make this up this is beautiful
[01:41:14] opportunities um unfortunately our basis
[01:41:16] is much much lower than this so we're
[01:41:19] not buying a ton here but new money came
[01:41:22] in we'd probably start we'd probably
[01:41:24] include that as one of the new positions
[01:41:26] uh say goodbye to teamu we covered that
[01:41:29] Alibaba stock is a winner we covered
[01:41:31] that that's coming out of Barons now
[01:41:33] it's not coming from the lady who was
[01:41:34] the China Basher for the last three
[01:41:36] years uh it's coming out of new people
[01:41:38] who have taken over the beat strategist
[01:41:41] who coined the Magnificent 7 warns us
[01:41:43] Tech is set to lag that is from Michael
[01:41:46] hartnet one of the best strategist on
[01:41:48] the cell side for sure moving along
[01:41:52] sandbagger in the mouse stock market and
[01:41:54] sentiment results we covered this
[01:41:57] stuff uh the names we were going to
[01:41:59] cover that didn't have time was horel
[01:42:01] with a 3.7% yield and crown castle with
[01:42:05] a 7% yield we love that here was a
[01:42:08] picture with the full
[01:42:11] Auditorium and Estee louder look this is
[01:42:15] a kitchen sink quarter with the new CEO
[01:42:19] Stephanie de la
[01:42:21] favier and this one we like and want to
[01:42:25] build more it's a relatively small
[01:42:27] position we're hoping to make it a
[01:42:28] bigger position over the next few months
[01:42:31] uh the next one was PayPal thing I like
[01:42:35] here you can read through all of this is
[01:42:45] um I like what Jeff did here he says
[01:42:49] sandbag guidance ever since Alex Chris
[01:42:51] has shocked the world CNBC interview he
[01:42:53] seems to have figured out that the
[01:42:54] secret to happiness both on Wall Street
[01:42:56] and in life is low expectations here's
[01:42:58] what he originally guided for fiscal
[01:43:00] year
[01:43:01] 2024 uh non-gaap EPS of 383 free cash
[01:43:04] flow of 5 billion and share repe
[01:43:06] purchases of at least 5 billion here's
[01:43:08] what the team actually delivered
[01:43:09] non-gaap EPS of 465 so he did 21% better
[01:43:14] than he promised free cash flow of 6.6
[01:43:17] billion which was 32% better than he
[01:43:19] promised in 2024 and share repurchases
[01:43:22] of 6 billion
[01:43:23] 20% more than he promised so he under
[01:43:26] promised he overd delivered taken to the
[01:43:28] extreme once again Alex appear Chris
[01:43:30] appears to be using the same strategy
[01:43:31] for fiscal year 2025 after seeing just
[01:43:34] how well it worked in 2024 the company
[01:43:36] is guiding for non-gaap EPS of 495 to
[01:43:40] 510 free cash flow of 6 to7 billion and
[01:43:43] a share repurchase of 6 billion but if
[01:43:45] we see similar upside to priz to last
[01:43:47] year when PayPal was still in transition
[01:43:49] phase whereas 2025 is about Partnerships
[01:43:51] and scaling product adoption EPS could
[01:43:54] Land north of $6 free cash flow around 8
[01:43:56] billion and BuyBacks reaching 7.2
[01:43:59] billion history doesn't repeat but it
[01:44:01] often Rhymes uh love that analysis and I
[01:44:04] think that's the key way to think about
[01:44:06] PayPal moving forward Disney doing great
[01:44:09] you can see here free cash flow price is
[01:44:11] lagging free cash flow recovery that's
[01:44:13] going to continue price is going to
[01:44:14] continue to climb and we'll wind up with
[01:44:16] our double from much lower levels than
[01:44:18] here out uh you know two years out and
[01:44:21] that will meet our IR our hurdles and
[01:44:24] what we like to see happen in our
[01:44:27] turnaround Tom special so you can go
[01:44:29] through all the highlighted points from
[01:44:31] the conference call and every all the
[01:44:33] other work that we do internally if you
[01:44:36] are serious about your positions all of
[01:44:39] this is opinion not advice go to hedge
[01:44:42] fund tips.com click on terms we deal
[01:44:45] exclusively with qu qualified clients
[01:44:47] and
[01:44:49] institutions uh and sophisticated
[01:44:51] investors etc etc
[01:44:53] Etc uh so we covered that and then
[01:44:57] finally Stanley Black and& Decker same
[01:44:59] story everyone nervous about the tariffs
[01:45:02] completely unfounded
[01:45:05] and uh will prove to be an incredible
[01:45:08] generational buy opportunity for a
[01:45:10] durable moat that has been around for
[01:45:11] decades and decades the type of
[01:45:13] businesses we like to buy fear down to
[01:45:15] 39 on the fear and greed index not what
[01:45:17] you see near top same thing with
[01:45:19] National Association of active
[01:45:21] investment managers puked out of their
[01:45:22] stocks last week so uh that's that Arc
[01:45:26] the Kathy Wood ETF top 30 weights
[01:45:28] earnings estimates are up 2.2% in the
[01:45:31] last 60 days oil and gas equipment and
[01:45:35] services uh ETF uh earnings power was
[01:45:39] revised down almost 10% for the top 30
[01:45:42] weights in the last 60
[01:45:44] days so we've not been in a rush on the
[01:45:47] servicers we think a few of them are
[01:45:48] getting cheap but we're just comfortable
[01:45:50] with our com stock EXP exposure for
[01:45:54] energy for the time being but we'll keep
[01:45:56] our eye on a few of the servicers
[01:45:58] estimates came down from 275 to
[01:46:02] 27363 that's what happens this time of
[01:46:04] year and we've covered earnings growth
[01:46:07] by sector so with that said let's get on
[01:46:10] to the ask me anything questions those
[01:46:12] of you who enjoy that and get value from
[01:46:15] viewer questions stick around those of
[01:46:17] you who just like the podcast thanks for
[01:46:19] tuning in we'll be back next week and
[01:46:22] here we go for for question number one
[01:46:24] is coming from Kyle M uh could you
[01:46:29] explain please explain how blackout
[01:46:31] periods work for corporate share
[01:46:32] repurchase programs usually you have to
[01:46:34] wait uh 3 days or so after uh
[01:46:38] information is publicly disseminated
[01:46:40] he's asking as it relates to PayPal and
[01:46:42] to
[01:46:43] Goose um at the end of the day who cares
[01:46:46] if they do it in 3 days or 30 days if
[01:46:48] they're if they can buy in 20% of the
[01:46:50] company uh in the case of PayPal or 10%
[01:46:53] the company in the case of goose you
[01:46:54] want it at lower prices not you know
[01:46:56] Panic knee jerking elf down 75% from
[01:46:59] high still growth trading under 20
[01:47:02] forward multiple for 30% growth looks
[01:47:04] pretty attractive here in the 60s we've
[01:47:06] covered this a few times I think I've
[01:47:08] said no a few times and been right let's
[01:47:11] see if anything has changed I mean these
[01:47:14] are the traps that people forget so here
[01:47:16] is a 40 bagger that just because it's
[01:47:19] down 100% they got recency biased they
[01:47:22] say oh 5 minutes ago it was 200 now it's
[01:47:24] only 100 what these broken momentum
[01:47:27] stocks they tend to go back to where
[01:47:28] they started uh I'm not saying that's
[01:47:30] necessarily the case with elf let's see
[01:47:32] what's happening with the fundamentals
[01:47:34] but I wouldn't touch this this is a
[01:47:36] broken Momo stock and I want nothing to
[01:47:38] do with it so let's just see if the
[01:47:40] fundamentals make me
[01:47:42] wrong um but usually this now cash flows
[01:47:47] eroding
[01:47:49] uh yeah we don't really care about pees
[01:47:52] what we care about is normalized
[01:47:53] earnings power and a normalized multiple
[01:47:56] on that normalized earnings power so
[01:47:57] there's no way to tell what the actual
[01:47:59] PE is because the business is just in
[01:48:01] its nent stages of
[01:48:04] deceleration and this has been a promote
[01:48:06] so let's see John
[01:48:09] marmo uh what's your opinion on Celsius
[01:48:11] and Charles River Celsius we've covered
[01:48:14] probably looking interesting I look uh
[01:48:16] we're not going to do anything with it
[01:48:18] but I think that's probably interesting
[01:48:20] Charles River uh I like stuff in the
[01:48:23] medical device this is probably another
[01:48:26] highquality business I'd be interested
[01:48:27] in let's take
[01:48:36] crl yeah definitely interested in
[01:48:38] Charles River so uh we have exposure to
[01:48:42] medical devices through Baxter uh but
[01:48:45] this is probably one worth looking at as
[01:48:46] well I like Baxter because it's more of
[01:48:49] a turnaround story but this one uh is
[01:48:52] also pretty solid business let's see
[01:48:54] what the balance sheet looks
[01:48:56] like uh this might be where you have
[01:48:58] your
[01:48:59] risk yeah uh $200 million in cash 2.2
[01:49:03] billion of debt let's see if the share
[01:49:06] count has been
[01:49:07] [Music]
[01:49:08] okay it's just they can't get their
[01:49:10] revenues moving that that's been their
[01:49:12] problem uh let's just take a look at
[01:49:19] annual yeah actually it's okay uh let's
[01:49:22] take a look at at share
[01:49:25] count all right not bad yeah I think
[01:49:28] this one's definitely worth doing some
[01:49:29] work on uh that's probably pretty decent
[01:49:31] find uh not when I'm in a rush but I
[01:49:34] think it's uh definitely worth looking
[01:49:37] at John Robert
[01:49:43] wanan Advanced Auto Parts in Stanley
[01:49:45] Black and Decker made in Mexico and
[01:49:47] China tff's Canna influence the stock
[01:49:49] performance in a negative way it's
[01:49:50] already done it that's I mean
[01:49:53] if you're at the Market discounts so
[01:49:56] it's like sell the rumor buy the news
[01:49:58] everyone's known tariffs are coming then
[01:50:01] once you get the flush on that then you
[01:50:03] can actually buy the stock um so I think
[01:50:07] it's fine and we covered kind of why
[01:50:08] thoughts on selones we've covered that a
[01:50:10] million times Alex we kind of like it
[01:50:12] here uh worth doing some work on FMC we
[01:50:15] kind of like it here that's from that
[01:50:18] Philipe pinkos FMC same story we like
[01:50:21] that uh Marlin staltz
[01:50:26] AMD uh what people expected do you think
[01:50:29] this come uh I'd rather stay with
[01:50:32] Intel uh Dale
[01:50:34] Wilson Walgreens I'm not interested in
[01:50:37] that business it'll probably be okay but
[01:50:39] I'm not interested it's just you know
[01:50:41] the world has changed it there probably
[01:50:43] be one or two left standing if it's two
[01:50:46] it's going to be CVS and Walmart uh
[01:50:48] Walgreens if it's one it's going to be
[01:50:50] CVS so um that's more of a trade than
[01:50:53] some something I want to own they'll
[01:50:55] sell off the Walgreens boots Alliance
[01:50:58] that's fine they'll pay down debt I
[01:51:00] still don't think it's a great
[01:51:02] business uh asking why I don't mention
[01:51:04] Intel I I did mention Intel I just said
[01:51:07] it's going to be dead money until they
[01:51:08] announce a new CEO and that's what it's
[01:51:09] been Tim D Celsius holding same story
[01:51:13] definitely worth doing some work we're
[01:51:14] not doing anything with it but I
[01:51:16] understand why you like it uh love your
[01:51:18] podcast you set up stop losses on
[01:51:20] positions no it's uh that's for retail
[01:51:23] Traders Robert War
[01:51:27] tanan Stanis no auto companies are
[01:51:30] Healthcare and annuity companies
[01:51:32] masquerading as vehicle producers and
[01:51:34] never want to be on the OEM side I'll be
[01:51:36] in the arms dealer side on Cooper
[01:51:38] standard Jimmy
[01:51:40] Jones
[01:51:42] uh Apple decline of sales in China due
[01:51:44] to regulation that and he's getting out
[01:51:47] competed by Huawei I mean you can google
[01:51:49] pictures of Jensen Wong with the Huawei
[01:51:52] full in phones they're 100 times better
[01:51:54] than Apple phones I mean it's just
[01:51:56] mindboggling uh what's going
[01:51:58] on
[01:52:01] and uh Apple's looking to partner with
[01:52:03] China Ai and Cloud to bypass these
[01:52:06] issues due to regulation what are your
[01:52:07] thought some Baba Baba's going up
[01:52:09] there's apple or not okay that's the
[01:52:12] bottom line uh JP ding how much will the
[01:52:15] 25% H tariffs her cooperon look there's
[01:52:18] not another what do you think is going
[01:52:20] to happen Okay do you think someone's
[01:52:22] going to say oh you know what I want to
[01:52:24] do let me go raise $100 million to set
[01:52:27] up a plant to make rubber sealers for US
[01:52:32] Auto cars uh in the middle of
[01:52:34] Mississippi at $50 an hour plus all
[01:52:37] kinds of regulations and OSHA
[01:52:39] and whoever knows what uh so I can get
[01:52:42] competed Away by people who can ship it
[01:52:44] in cheaper even after paying the tariffs
[01:52:46] at the end of the day the demand is not
[01:52:48] going to change for the type of products
[01:52:50] that Cooper standard sells the question
[01:52:52] is how much is the end consumer going to
[01:52:53] pay for it and that's up to Trump uh you
[01:52:56] know but uh inflation is just a tax on
[01:52:58] the poor and that's exactly what that
[01:53:01] will create in a short term so um you
[01:53:05] guys got to think think this through a
[01:53:06] little bit Gunther van
[01:53:09] arcott uh then thank you blah blah
[01:53:13] blah yeah same question everyone's
[01:53:15] asking the same question it's
[01:53:17] mindboggling uh Rahul
