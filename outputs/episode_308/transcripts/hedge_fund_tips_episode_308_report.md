# Hedge Fund Tips with Tom Hayes – Episode N/A
### Week Ending November 26, 2025

**Executive Summary**
> This episode is extremely bullish, focusing on identifying undervalued opportunities and capitalizing on market dislocations. Tom emphasizes patience, a sound framework, and not trading on margin. He highlights the importance of understanding the underlying business and avoiding the 'shiniest objects' that lead to FOMO. He is particularly excited about Alibaba, PayPal, Hormel and Dagio.

**Tom's Current Market Conviction: Bullish, with a focus on specific sectors and companies. → 9/10** 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥☆

- Anticipation of Fed rate cuts.
- Undervalued opportunities in defensive sectors.
- Potential for significant gains in specific companies like Alibaba and PayPal.

## Macro Thesis & Key Data Points
The market is in a mid-cycle expansion, with potential for consolidation before a year-end rally. Fed rate cuts are expected to drive further expansion, benefiting rate-sensitive sectors and small caps. Defensive sectors like staples, healthcare, and energy are currently overlooked and represent generational opportunities.

| Indicator | Value | Tom's Interpretation |
|-----------|-------|----------------------|
| Mortgage Rates | 30-year fixed below 6%, Option ARMs at 5.62% | Confirms the thesis that rates are coming down, fueling the housing market. |
| ETF Market Share US Small Caps | Record lows going back 30 years | Small caps are just getting started. |
| S&P 500 Quarterly Year-on-Year EPS Growth | 11% vs 4% consensus expectations | Earnings growth is strong and likely to continue. |
| PPI | 2.6% vs 3.3% expected | Preview of coming attractions. The Fed could go 50 bips without blinking an eye, but they won't. They'll do 25 and then they'll have to play catch-up later. |
