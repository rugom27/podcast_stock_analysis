I'm Tom Hayes. Your second weekly recap. What ways can we stay tomorrow by the news ladies and gentlemen? So why you could eat a banana side? Three bananas sideways watermelon sideways. 200 video and I think I said history doesn't repeat but it often runs video. Burden yourself with the facts. Burden yourself with the facts. the number one podcast in the hedge fun category.\n\n### MISCELLANEOUS\n\nAnd I'm sure we'll be doing some uh some projects with him and really really grateful for that and it couldn't come out a better week with all that's been happening with Cooper Standard and Baba and all the others. So uh super excited for that. I want to thank Stephen Nellis and Aditia Sony for including me in their article on Reuters. Some\n\n### QUOTES_OF_THE_WEEK\nI want to thank Stephen Nellis and Aditia Sony for including me in their article on Reuters.\n\n### QUOTES_OF_THE_WEEK\n\nPeter Lynch, when stocks are attractive, you buy them. Sure, they can go lower. I bought stocks at $12 that went to $2, but then later went on to $30. You just don't know when you can find the bottom. That's from Peter Lynch, legendary fund manager, Fidelity Mellan Fund, Bruce Cobner. Through bitter experience, I've learned that a mistaken position correlation is the root of some of the most serious problems in trading. If you have eight highly correlated positions, then you are really trading one position that is eight times as large. and those clients know obviously seeing the incredible returns that we've had and the low low correlation that we have to the indices uh has been a blessing and then the bespoke individual positions and then how we do the overlays so um super super uh excited and then Buffett I will tell you how to become rich close the doors be fearful when others are greedy be greedy when others are fearful and you know it's interesting I think so Many people apply this because they look at the indices every day and they say, \"Oh, the market is high or the market is low.\" And what they totally miss is that on every given day, the market serves up prices. And we get to decide whether or not they're correctly priced, overpriced, or misappraised. And even in a market where the tape feels frothy, if you look at what's out of favor, defensives, which by the way are going to abruptly come back into favor, and we're positioned to take advantage of that as well. Um, uh, you'd be absolutely amazed the things that can be done on a daily basis, even when when the market and the problem is is when the market is frothy, everyone crowds into the frothiest items within that, and that's how they get hurt over and over and over. they get FOMO, they chase the wrong things and uh and they're highly correlated. And here we do the exact opposite as you know, as you've been following for so many years. Uh and we're grateful for that support. And we're going to do more of it today. We've got an awful lot of stuff to cover today. I just want to uh uh give you guys a clue and understand why the smart money and the clients that have the most amount of money with me have been putting a lot more money with me. Um, and the ones that uh don't have money are saying when's the right time and this and that. Um, but have been uh really lining up for for October for sure. But I want to just kind of walk you through some of the names that we've talked about over months and years and kind of like if you step back and zoom out and understand where we are in the process. We're not chasing the Palunteers. We're not chasing the Nvidas. We're not chasing some of the ones that are at at levels where I'd be very very nervous every night going to sleep. Um, we're we're in the ones that are just getting started. Now, you take a look at Advanced Auto Parts, which is up double off the lows in a few months. Sure, could it consolidate for, you know, four, six weeks before making the next move to 100? Sure, uh, before it doubles again. Um, but this is not a stock that you're buying at the top. This is a stock you're buying close to the bottom. You know, even Baba, look at this move from 64, actually 55 to now 155. Um, more than beyond more than double, even now double off the basis. We brought the basis down to to 82 and change. And by the way, you know, it's unbelievable. We got a ton of options expiring in uh in January that were spreads that we bought between 65 and 70, and we were taking off. You know, the max expected value on those is 7x. And we were taking off a ton, millions upon millions of dollars between 5 and a half and 6x. So, we could wait for the seventh X. But when you're up 450 to 550% on millions upon millions of million, you ring the register. Did we sell one single share? No. the the move in Alibaba is just beginning, but it's so far past the spread of our strikes when we bought at 65 and 70 cents when everyone was puking in the hole and now we can sell close to $4. Uh, you know, you don't want to be a pig waiting for that fifth and then you get, you know, a little pullback before January or whatever. And we'll we have a ton ton left to to get 450 and even $5. We'll have some that that uh we just allow to expire at max value of 7x. But if we're getting out at 6.25 six times the our money on a huge huge enormous position and and what's so unbelievable, it's not just, you know, it's not just being right in the right stock because the stocks, you know, that's great. We're up double, but the expression of how we do this is like all of the returns. if we were just buying eight stocks and waiting like, okay, that's great. We do better. You know, we get our doubles and triples uh over a couple years. It's not that. It's this it's the secret sauce of what we're doing with the uh overlays that is generating huge amounts of return with very little amount of excess risk. And um the amount of money that we've made in Baba with the POS with the move not even halfway done um is just staggering. And we booked a ton of that and and we got a ton more to book between now in January. But you know, we've got so many multiples of our money off the table um uh just from what we've been able to harvest at uh not the full seven times, but the five and a half, six plus times. it. The point that I'm trying to make to you ladies and gentlemen is if you follow a sound framework and you get um and you're patient and you don't trade on margin and um you know for my clients especially that hung in there and are getting so unbelievably rewarded um you earned it. And that's, you know, what we say since the beginning is they don't give away multiaggers for free. Okay. Was it fun, you know, buying uh Cooper Standard at $5 and change and watching it go to 3.85 before going to 15 before dropping back to 9 before going to 25 before dropping back to 13 and now at, you know, whatever it is. What the hell is it? it's at uh almost $40 and on its way to 80 and beyond. Uh but that's why you're rewarded and that's why most people aren't. You know, they buy things up like, you know, the shiniest objects and then they miss a quarter and the stock's down 40% and they did it on margin and they blow themselves up and uh because they don't know what they owned. Backter, does this look like it's it's it's you're you're buying it frothy? Like if the market corrected 15% next month, my money is that not only would this not correct 15%. This would probably be up 20 to 30% because it's a defensive uh and you can see it did the exact same thing in the early 2000s. It has these cyclical dramatic flushes uncertainty over healthcare and then it works its way back up to new highs and this will be a four bagger. Uh and we've been loading out. Look at, you know, Cooper standard. People like, \"Oh, it's too high.\" Well, deconstruct it and you tell me if if we get to, forget 18 million, which is what we hit every cycle for the last 45 years. If we get to 17 million shares, the thing earns 10 to12. So, you know, is a 10 times multiple too rich on on on 1012? That's $120 stock. What if it gets to a 20 times multiple like it did back here? 140. Oh, should I invest? You know, the market's frothy. Depends what you're buying. Disney, we've had a huge move in there. We bought a ton at 85, so it's 120, 117. This thing hasn't even started. This is going to work its way to new highs. Streaming is profitable. They got a moat around their businesses, the parks, the cruises, the whole thing. Generrack has had it double over the last couple of months. This is just beginning its cycle. This is going to go work its way back 200, 300, and beyond. and maybe back to new highs with what's happening with the um uh data center business that we covered in in recent weeks. Intel, we've got gone through this. Do you think you're overpaying here? I mean, this is early days. We're going to talk a little bit about that this week. government's going to force force people to take stuff implicit coercion to take Intel's 14A stuff and sign up for big orders and you are going to see this thing back over 60 back over a 100red and beyond as this thing works out over time small caps. Okay, now people are getting interested that it's just breaking out to all-time highs after this, you know, cup and handle for all the technicians. Measured move implies another $90. So that would be 243. Uh so 34 330 minimum and and this is just early days for small caps. We've been talking about it. All you got skeptical on me here when we were just buying everything under the sun and now here we are breaking out to new highs. Same with regional banks. Everyone was chasing the megas. The regionals are just breaking out. You're going to see a huge amount of consolidation. PayPal. This thing is generating more cash than they know what to do with. This one is going to be another Alibaba where you're you get patient. You know, here we Let's just pull it up again for the 87th time. You know what? We're going to skip commodities today. We'll do them next week because we got too many\n\n What if it gets to a 20 times multiple like it did back here? 140. Oh, should I invest? You know, the market's frothy. Depends what you're buying. ### FEATURED_COMPANY_DEEP_DIVES Disney, we've had a huge move in there. We bought a ton at 85, so it's 120, 117. This thing hasn't even started.

We'll do them next week because we got too many ### ASK_ME_ANYTHING_QA\n\nquestions . But I want you to look at this. We went over it a million times with Alibaba and I said, \"Hang in there, ladies and gentlemen. Hang in there, ladies and gentlemen.\" Well, let me tell you where we are with Alibaba. Okay, we just broke through here. We just got out of denial. Now we are starting the parabolic move all the way back up to new highs with returning confidence. I'll show you the chart once again so you can see this. Okay, you had aversion. This is denial and now we are into moving up here. Remember this. Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom. We are in the parabolic move stage. This is going to go well over $200 and everyone's going to start getting excited once there's a two handle on it. And we've already made we'll have by that time made six and a half, 7x on our options. we'll be up 3x on our stock and um you know not not a bad day for the largest position by far in the portfolio although Cooper Standard has moved so much that that's a huge position uh not because of that's what where it started but you know with uh four five six seven and a halfx that that kind of stuff happens. So um so where are we with PayPal? Okay, everyone's super skeptical. Alex Chris is doing everything he said he was going to do and then some. But people can't wait. So here you are. You had your break big breakdown. This is exactly where we are, ladies and gentlemen. Ready? We are in right here. Aversion. Okay, we shot up to 90 anxiety back to aversion. We're going to get to denial pretty quickly like we just got through with Baba. And then we're going to get to return confidence when we have the parabolic move. So new money comes in today. I'd be buying the out of PayPal. I'd be buying it till my fingers bled while everyone's saying, \"Is the market too high? Should I sell my indexes? Should I sell my mag seven?\" I don't know. I'm not your money manager. You go go talk to uh uh you know, someone else. Okay? We do serious underwriting here. Private equity in the public markets. If we wouldn't buy 100% of the company with 100% of our net worth, we won't buy one share. PayPal. There's nothing to think about with free cash flow. Stanley Black & Decker. Okay. Oh, it's had this, you know, 60% move off the lows. Okay. So, what? Did the exact same thing in the early 2000s. Big fake out we had uh in April. Now, we're just getting started. We're going to work back up to new highs over the next couple years. Housing rates lower, the whole game. We've been talking about this. It's happening in real time, but it's early days. And um it's like people are like, \"Well, how do you put new money to work?\" There's nothing to think. I mean, I could still buy VFC Corp at $16. Are you kidding me? Like, how many shares can I possibly get my hands on? I got Brack and Daryl. This is going to be a four bagger plus on the stock. Probably another five bagger on the options. I mean, actually, it's going to be more than a five bagger on the options. It's going to be eight or nine bagger on the options because we were able to buy so many in the in the twelves and the spreads that we did. Yeah. Anyway, it it's I I just love this business. I mean, I absolutely I mean, if I loved golf as much as I loved doing this business, I'd be a scratch already. I got down to a 93, by the way. I hit my low index earlier in this week and then the next day I went out and shot a 95 because my rib muscles are bothering me again. But we got a hyperbaric chamber. I'm all good. I'm going to go back out and shoot 8283 like I did last weekend. So, um, anyway, mortgage rates, here we go. What have we been saying? By the end of the year, 30-year fix below six. Well, where are we? 628 and we haven't even got the cut yet. What about these option arms? They're now 562. Um, ladies and gentlemen, this is the the game is very close to being on. ETF market share US small caps record lows going back 30 years. This game is just getting started. Uh, hiring well short of expectations. We know the million revisions now. What a complete train wreck. I can't believe that stuff happened. I mean, those people should be hunted down anyway. It's It's sad, but new leadership is coming. We're going to get better numbers. There's always going to be revisions, but that that just was absolutely egregious. Um, can you find the trend? Jobs created, so it continues to go down. Mainland China margin debt levels versus market cap just getting out of the the just getting out of the gate here. Not yet massively elevated. S&P 500 quarterly year-on-year EPS growth relative to consensus expectations 11 versus 4 uh earnings growth expectations for next quarter 7%. Uh so we'll see where it comes in. Probably greater than double digits again. By the way, biotech just getting started here. I mean this is exciting. This has been consolidating for two years. This looks like it's just $5 away from denial. Once we get up to 100 105, we're right here, denial. And then we get our parabolic move and people say, \"What happened?\" And all of a sudden, everyone that bailed out down\n\n### MACRO_DATA_SLIDES\nmortgage rates, here we go. What have we been saying? By the end of the year, 30-year fix below six. Well, where are we? 628 and we haven't even got the cut yet. What about these option arms? They're now 562. ETF market share US small caps record lows going back 30 years. This game is just getting started. Uh, hiring well short of expectations. Mainland China margin debt levels versus market cap just getting out of the the just getting out of the gate here. Not yet massively elevated. S&P 500 quarterly year-on-year EPS growth relative to consensus expectations 11 versus 4 earnings growth expectations for next quarter 7%. Biotech just getting started here. This has been consolidating for two years. This looks like it's just $5 away from denial. Once we get up to 100 105, we're right here, denial. And then we get our parabolic move and people say, \"What happened?\" AI net bulls unprecedented bearishness despite all-time highs. Falling construction spend lead equals recession signal. Equities as a share of household assets, US is 49%. China is 9%. This is going to shift dramatically. China is going to be accelerating more and more. Russell 2000 breaking out. Transports breaking out.\n### FEATURED_COMPANY_DEEP_DIVES\nSpeaking of transport, I keep looking at UPS. We haven't done anything yet, but uh that's interesting. Target, uh, UPS, looking at Starbucks because coffee prices are going to come down and their margins are going to go up just like Hormeell, the the meat prices are going to come down and their margins are going to go back up. Restaurants are getting hurt because of meat prices. All those stocks are going to absolutely double and triple. There's so much to do in restaurants. Change in sector waiting since 48. Everyone's dumped out of healthcare and staples. These are going to get bid when you see a little volatility in the market, which you will. We're positioned for it. We love it. Diverging path, profitable small caps have outperformed their money losing peers this year. Total infrastructure investment spend needs 68 trillion. margins continue to improve back up to 11.3 from a 7% trough in 2021. Fallen job openings. Nixon analog. Value and small caps outperformed in the 1970s.\n\n### MACRO_DATA_SLIDES\nChange in sector waiting since 48. Uh, you could see here everyone's dumped out of healthcare and staples. These are going to get bid. uh when when you see a little volatility in the market, which you will. We're positioned for it. We love it. margins continue to improve back up to 11.3 from a 7% trough in 2021. Uh four-year cycle, these are the air years that uh we we tend to do extremely well when there's a lot of turmoil, whether it was buying lows in uh tech in October 2022 and March of 2023 or COVID or this year in April. Um, so the third year of the presidential cycle tends to have volatility. That's where we just absolutely crush it. So, we're excited to get into that period. Uh, dollar stores have outperformed Nvidia in 2025, by the way. You know, that was those were names we were talking about um when they were really beaten down in April. Fallen job openings. So, yeah, they got to get on with the cuts. Hopefully a 50, but more likely a 25. Uh Nixon analog. What's this about? Oh, this is Hartnet being bearish. Value and small caps outperformed in the 1970s. Okay, so he's using this as an analog uh talking about the easing and then what happened with value, small caps, REITs, commodities, real estate. I do think this is a good analog. This is also a similar analog that we saw from 2001 to 2006. Uh and in this period actually uh tech started to underperform. So I do think there's something to be said there.\n\n### HEADLINES_AND_NEWS\n\n### TECHNICAL_CHARTS\n\n### ASK_ME_ANYTHING_QA\n\n### MACRO_DATA_SLIDES\nUS equity inflows still dominating year to date. China big move. So China has got the most performance 3 to one over the US and they have the least inflows. It's like the money is just going to be cascading there. Once you get the Xi handshake, if you think the move to 155 was exciting, wait till you see what happens after this. Uh market typically rises when Fed resumes cutting alongside a growing economy. We agree. Uh Athletic Apparel stocks, Lulu, Nike, VF Corp. They've all been weak. These are going to absolutely rip higher. The reason we don't own Nike and not taking a serious look at Lulu is because we have VFC Corp. The reason we have VF Corp is a huge bet on Bracken who had the 28 bagger at the Logitech turnaround is doing an incredible job doing everything he says and he had a lot more outs. He had the Supreme which helped deliver the balance sheet. He's got five other brands a lot of things he can buy and sell in this environment and he will uh and we don't want to be correlated going back to the Bruce Cner quote. So overcorrelated we we've got our exposure in that group. Um keep looking at Dow haven't done anything yet. keep looking at Centine. They just have too much of that Medicaid expo exposure, but it's interesting at these levels because it's pricing that it's like going out of business and it's not. Um seasonality of September, you tend to get a bump early, a little volatility at the end before the year- end rally. Um this shows September versus the rate cut. Contrary to consensus, we think September is going to be an up month. And that's because the Fed been on hold all year and is going to cut for the first time in September. That's only happened twice in the last 50 years. And markets did well both times. Uh so you see the cut starts. This would probably be the better analog, which was 2024, the cut starts, and you get follow through. Car dealership guy, automaker, winners and losers in August. You see a lot of these guys. Toyota up 14%. Honda, Ford is up. SUVs, crossovers, and hybrids continue to carry the market. Household leverage is at a 50-year low. This is unbelievable. This $35 trillion of trapped equity helock game is going to be on. That's going to be consumer mania, restaurant mania, housing mania. It and and these haven't even started. Russell large cap value benchmark is close to a record discount to growth by uh PE ratio going back to when? 2021. This is going to be so much fun the next 5 to seven years. We are going to make so much money. It's going to be insane. Um if by the way most of you are already smiling. So why do you eat four bananas sideways this year? I mean, borrow my glasses. What's going to take place in the next five years is going to be unreal. And um okay, Fed cut equals expansion. That's fun. Here's what the period we're in right now. Kind of bouncing up to the high end of the range, get a little bit of consolidation, year-end rally. That's normal this time of year. So, next couple of weeks, we'll be talking about that consolidation. Those of you who have new money in, we'll be able to take advantage of that. Um, Russell 2000 small cap flows just beginning. You can see here as it's breaking out to new highs. Mainland cap cap China capital inflows into Hong Kong stocks have reached 1 trillion Hong Kong dollars so far this year. Divide that by 850 billion. That's exciting. Speculators are net short across US stock futures. Um, yeah, that's unreal. I mean, that's that's why it's hard to say we're gonna like see any meaningful pullback in September and October beyond, you know, a normal garden variety 5 to 8% which I don't even think uh you'll get as much as that because people are just so skeptical and they so missed so much. So, they're going to just they're going to have to buy the unmagnificent 493 to just they're going to have to buy every single weakness into year end. uh elevated pipeline of deals with issuance. Uh buy performance and buyback aristocrats versus equal weight gross and net buybacks. We have this Russell 2000 just getting ready to break out again. And when they break out, it's it's it's usually multiple multiple years, not weeks or months. Large stocks haven't always dominated the markets. Um, you can see the cycles we've done this international versus US. Small, you can see here the biggest rally in the shortest amount of time from 2000 to 2006. This is where we are, ladies and gentlemen. In my view, you see it in the 70s. You also see it in the early 90s. Uh, which is midcycle, which we've been saying we're probably midcycle another 9 years or so till 2032, 2034. uh until the millennials age up to um early to mid-40s and their spending slows down. Um Alibaba's short interest declines after new chip report. Shorts getting squeezed left and right. European and UK value stocks are now ahead of the S&P 500 over the past 1, three, and five years. How do you like that? Early industry gains drove the largest productivity booms. Today's productivity is historically low. That's going to help regular businesses. All this AI stuff. Wait till you see how it applies to the most boring businesses in the 493. And you're going to your minds are going to be blown with all the flows into China with all the move in China. You can see here it's just now breaking out of this long cup and handle. Uh short interest is just rolling over. Emerging market stocks traded highest level since 2021. We've been pounding the table on that for a while. Two years now. Now we look like everyone's saying, \"Wow, great job down here.\" People were saying you're don't know what you're talking about. said the dollar was going to weaken. People said you don't know what you're talking about. And uh those of you who tuned in every week knew we were knew what we were talking about and you've reaped the benefits. Um BLS erases 911,000 jobs and largest revision on record. That's unbelievable. says the largest revision on record since the Obama administration 2009 and 2010. Alibaba Hong Kong stock price and net flow from southbound stock connect. This was part of our core thesis last August. We were saying it's coming, it's coming. There were no signs of it and now it's all come at once. Alibaba share price has surged since hitting lows last year. here. That's the front page of the Financial Times. S&P 500 trend channel since October 2022. Low end of the trend channel. Top end is well over 7,000. Commercial CNI loans just starting. Restaurant year-on-year spending growth accelerated month-on-month from 2.5 in July to 3.7 in August. Wait till people start tapping those helocks. Uh producer price changes. We'll cover that. Came in a lot. PPI came in a lot lower than expected. That's a lead indicator. The um Fed could go 50 bips without blinking an eye, but they won't. They'll do 25 and then they'll have to play catch-up later. And hopefully it's not too late. Returns after first Fed cuts. S&P past 12 month after starting with cutting cycles. Earnings growth multiple expansion 9.6%. Data center power demand is projected to increase 165% by 2030. There's your comtock. There's your range resources. There's your gener backup CNI generators for the data centers. weight of tech as a percent of total market. I don't want to be overweight tech here, guys. You're going to get hurt. It's just a matter of when. Maybe it goes up another three years. So, kudos to you. You gamble and win, but eventually they're going to take you out on the stretcher. Equal weight versus cap weight. This is a level if you're not a buyer, you're going to miss the boat. You're already seeing it this year. CPI subdued. Okay, so that's the point, ladies and gentlemen. You're here on Baba breaking out of denial into the parabolic move. You're right down here for PayPal getting ready to hit denial and then we'll start to go parabolic by year end, end of year. Still a lot of stock we can buy in that one. A lot. And then the overlays is going to be the bigger deal. Here's overall index barometers that we take a look at each day and each week just to kind of get a feel for where we're at. I'm looking at the option skew.

And you can see the inverse relationship at an inflection point. Now, uh cyclical versus defensive flows since the October uh since the April 8th low. And high y high dividend yield still cheap and underowned, the cheapest since 2001. We've covered this. It's starting to this is going to be a core theme for the next 24 months. You're going to see it happening. Dividend yield is neglected by active managers. A key driver of this view is the fact that dividend yield remains cheap and neglected, a trend we've we expect to reverse quickly as the Fed enters this easing cycle once rate cuts begin. The 7.4 trillion sitting on the sidelines earning 4% risk-f free will be forced to find yield elsewhere. When that happens, these sleepy, boring dividend payers will be in high demand, triggering a rotation that brings defenses back into vogue and will be more than happy to help investors get exposure. Two of the names we believe are well positioned to benefit from this rotation and the focus of this week's article are Hormel and Dagio.\n### FEATURED_COMPANY_DEEP_DIVES\nHormel just reported his fastest topline growth in nearly 3 years plus 6% yearonear. Let me repeat that. Fastest topline growth in nearly 3 years. 6% yearonear as the protein craze continues to show no signs of slowing. Unfortunately, a steep and unexpected rise in commodity costs caught Horell off sides, erasing much of that benefit and putting earnings under pressure. Par for the course this earnings season, the market overreacted, sending shares down 13%, we were in the market buying as many shares as we could. And for those who sold us shares in the whole, we thank you for your service. So you can see here hogs they do you know bacon and all that stuff live cattle horell dinty beef stew uh and feeder cattle has gone parabolic it's now starting to break down when these commodities break like you saw in 2014 and you in live and feeder they don't break down a little they break down abruptly and the trend continues for three years that's when you're going to see the restaurant stocks the horses of the world absolutely go straight up at the End of the day, Hormel has been compounding wealth since 1891, not 2021, 1891. They've been doing this for a while, ladies and gentlemen. To think this is the first time it has faced rising input costs over 130 years is laughable. As it has done many times before, Hormeell will work through a handful of quarters of margin volatility while passing through costs. Zoom out and this will be nothing more than a blip on the radar. On top of that, you have a proven CEO, Jeff Edinger, back at the helm to write the ship through October 2026 with plenty of time to work his magic and position the new CEO to step in as a hero. In the meantime, we'll continue to add shares where we can collect the five 4.5% dividend yield and growing by the way and watch this sleepy name recover. Okay, under Etinger last tenure during 11 years he had an a five bagger in 11 years. He came in when the stock was $7. He left when the stock was $38. Uh I think he's going to have at least a double if not a triple. Uh but probably between now and 2026, probably a double. Uh and then the new CEO will take it from there. In the meantime, you get a growing dividend yield and you get to lock in that dividend yield. And the reason that's important is because they are a dividend aristocrat. So, not only are you locking in that yield, but it keeps growing every single year. And when you can lock in a 4.5% dividend yield on Hormeell, uh, you know, 10 years from now, you're you've got a 10% yield on your basis and you've got a triple stock and a and a a perennial compounder for 130 plus years. So, we've highlighted some of the key points. They've had 59 consecutive years of dividend increases, 97 years of dividend payments without interruption. Their dividend yield grows at a 5% compound annual growth rate. So basically every uh 12 every 14 years the dividend doubles at that pace. So in 14 years you'd be getting a 9% yield on your basis and growing. So call it, you know, 15, 16 years, your dividend will have doubled. The stock will have probably quadrupled. Uh and uh and your income keeps going up every year above the pace of inflation. It's unbelievable. Uh and people are clamoring to buy tea bills. So they took their sales guidance up from 2.1 billion to 2.15 billion mean uh net sales organic net sales growth up 2.3 2 to 3% operating income growth up 5 to 7%. 10 key points organic net sales rose 6% year-on-year to 3.3 3.03 03 billion accelerating for the third straight quarter and sharply above Q2's 1% growth. Growth was driven by volume plus 3% and pricing plus 2% and positive performance across all three segments. Two adjusted operating margins fell 80 basis points yearon-year to 8.4% as steep runup in commodity inflation completely eroded the benefits from the strong runup in topline growth. Beef costs remain near all-time highs. Pork bellies are up 30%, wholesale pork up 10%, driving a 400 basis points increase in raw material cost inflation in Q3 alone. Management is implementing targeted pricing actions and evaluating additional measures with profit recovery expected to lag into next year as cost pressures persist in Q4 and price hikes only partially benefit the the upcoming quarter. However, this is not the first time Hormell has faced high commodity prices in it 130 year operating history. They have a track record of successfully passing on costs in the past and we expect this time will be no different. Number three, the transform and modernize initiative rem remains on track delivering results in line with management expectations of 90 b 90 projects contributing measurable val value and earnings. Management continues to expect incremental benefits for fiscal years 2025 of 100 to 150 million is currently tracking toward the high end of the range. Retail segment delivered 5% volume growth, 5% net sales growth and segments of profit uh and segment profits of negative4%. Topline strength was broad-based with five of six brands posting year-on-year growth. Geno was a standout, up 13% year-on-year, continuing to outpace the broader category and gain market share on top of its number one position. Spam also delivered another quarter year-on-year volume and net sales growth. Segment profitability was pressured by input costs with management expecting profits to begin to recover in 2026 as pricing actions take effect. The food service segment delivered 2% organic volume growth, 7% organic net sales growth, and segment profits down 1% year-on-year. Hormemell outpaced the broader industry despite ongoing pressure, including declining restaurant traffic and soft, higher margin convenience store visits. Premium pepperoni was a standout, posting over 20% volume growth. Management expects the pass through nature of costs in the food service portfolio to drive a faster recovery of profitability, which is key as the segment typically commands mid- teens operating margin versus high single digits at retail. Six, the international segment delivered 8% volume growth, 6% net sales growth, but its segment profitability fell 13% year-on-year. Topline strength was driven by thriving Chinese market and positive export results led by chi global the the global spam brand profitability was primarily impacted by ongoing competitive pressures in Brazil. Seven Planters acquired by Hormel in 2021 for 3.35 billion continues its turnaround achieving higher year-on-year growth in distribution, household penetration, and turning dollar sales positive by quarter end with capacity now in place to meet demand. Management expects continued sales momentum. On the bottom line, profit recovery is lagging expectations, though Q3 profit did grow, albeit more slowly, than topline gains. Eight. Management continues to prioritize the company's dividend aristocrat status, returning $159 million to shareholders this quarter alone through dividend payments, bringing total dividends to $474 million through Q3. This marks 59 consecutive years of dividend increases and the 388th consecutive quarterly dividend with a 5-year dividend growth kagger of 5%. Capex for the quarter totaled 72 million or 2.4% of net sales up from 65 million last year. The largest investments remain focused on expanding capacity and optimizing the manufacturing footprint with management forecasting fullear capex of 300 million. And 10 management revised fullear guidance narrowing net sales to 2.15 billion from 2.1 billion implying 2 to 3% organic net sales growth due to steep commodity cost increases. Adjusted operating income is now expected at 1.05 5 to 1.07 billion with adjusted EPS midpoint reduced to 1.44 from 1.63. Most importantly, management reiterated that long-term algorithm remains intact. 2 to 3% organic net sales\nStill generating 2.7 billion of free cash. Now moving on to Dagio. This is yet another straw hat. Buying straw hats in the winter. That's what we like to do, ladies and gentlemen. We buy straw hats when no one wants them in the wintertime. And then when everyone wants them in the summertime, uh we sell them at double. Shares have been cut in half as if consumers will never drink again. We're more than happy to take the other side of that trade. While consumers may be moderating, the real trend is clear. They are drinking less but drinking better. No company is better positioned to capitalize on this long-term premium immization than Diagio. Dagio is a classic story of cyclical downturns playing out within a long-term secular uptrend and we expect this cycle to be no different. The number one thing we can look for in a turnaround is free cash flow recovering and that is already well underway with management targeting $3 billion of free cash flow for the coming year. In the meantime, as management waits for the inevitable cycle to turn, they continue to focus on what they can control, cutting costs and positioning the company for the next leg of growth. Zoom out a few years and Dagio will be leaner, stronger, and benefiting from margin tailwinds tied to premiumization. It will be growing at a mid singledigit clip and trading above $200 tomorrow. In our opinion, again, you're at hedge fun.com. Uh, scroll to the top, click on terms. This is all opinion, not advice. Consult with your financial advisor, psychic, guru, magic eightball, whatever you need to do before doing anything. Let's go here. Number one thing we look for is free cash flow coming in in the meantime. Ah, okay. Mids singledigit clip trading above 200 tomorrow's newspaper today. Until then, we sit on our hands and collect our 4% dividend and wait. Top 10 uh points. Number one, organic net sales rose 1.7% ahead of street consensus of 1.4 driven by.9% volume growth and8 price mix growth. Management noted that the tariff driven pull forward behind last quarter's 5.9% year-on-year growth has largely cycled through with inventory levels now normalized. Number two, Diagio gained or maintained share in 65% of total net sales across measured markets including the US and delivered organic growth in four or five regions. Sales rose 1.5% in North America, 9.2% in Latin America and Caribbean. If you remember, that's where they had all the problems when the stock tanked. Uh so that's now recovering.3% in Europe, 10.5% in Africa, while Asia-Pacific declined 3.2% on weaker China and travel retail. I can tell you one thing in Africa where they've got 10.5% growth they're not worried about ompic and they're not worried about uh zero calorie zero alcohol Dagio they're selling the real stuff and they're selling it by the boatload three Guinness remained a standout during the quarter delivering 13% organic net sales growth and gaining share in its top three markets Great Britain Ireland and the US Guinness 0.0 Zero continues to expand, driving 40% growth in Diagio's non-alcoholic portfolio, where the company leads the market at four times the size of its nearest competitor. Don Julio was another highlight, up 38% organically and gaining share in 90% plus of measured markets. Number four, management raised its cost savings target under the Accelerate program to $625 million from $500 million over three years. 50% of the savings are expected to flow through to the bottom line, supporting mids singledigit organic operating profit growth for fiscal year 2026 and sustaining a 29% sectorle leading EBIT margin with the remainder reinvested for growth. Diagio generated 2.75 billion in free cash flow for the year, up 139 million year. Improving cash flow remains a top priority for management with guidance for at least $3 billion annually starting in 2026, which includes a one-time accelerate program cost with upside potential as the business recover at current prices. This implies free cash flow yield of at least 5%. Six, cleaning up the balance sheet remains a top priority with DI Dagio ending the quarter with 21.9 billion in net debt and 3.4 times net leverage ratio in line with prior guidance of 3.3 to 3.5. management retrain remains on track to hit 2.5 to three times net debt to IBID target by fiscal year 2028 at the latest seven% of Dagio's business is unaffected by US tariffs with most products exempt under USMCA management expects a $200 million annualized operating profit hit but aims to mitigate 50% in year one before broader tariff specific pricing actions Eight management expects capex of 1.2 to 1.3 billion for the coming year, down from 1.5 in fiscal year 2025 as they continue to focus on improving return on invested capital and higher growth opportunities over the next three years. Capex is projected to decline to a mid singledigit percent of next sales versus 7.7 in fiscal year 20259. Diagio has a track record of active portfolio management and remains committed to pursuing disposals of non-core assets. However, despite earlier rumors, management has no plans to sell Guinness or its stake in Moet Hennessy at this time 10 for fiscal year 2026. Management expects organic net se sales growth near fiscal 2025 levels uh ne negative one uh which is 1.7% with slowly slightly negative first half and accelerating second half which would imply organic sales growth in the 4% range. They anticipate a return to positive operating leverage as cost savings kick in driving mids singledigit organic profit growth which includes the current impact of tariffs. So that's the story there. Can read all the key highlights from the earnings call. Fear and greed is at neutral levels. National Association of Active Investment Managers a little fear in there. Healthcare top 30 weights revised down 2.44%. That's why people are so bearish on it. The biggest downward revisions have been the insurers like Elevance, Sigma, UNH, and then a few drug companies. But for the most part, on a company by company basis, most of them have been revised up. PPI, as we discussed, was expected to come in at 3.3%, came in at 2.6%. That's a preview of coming attractions. They might be late with these cuts, but if they if they get caught up quickly, it'll be fine.

You can see earnings are now back over not only at 300, but remember they got down to like 293 for next year. They're now at 303. Uh, and that's a big deal. So, uh, with that said , we're going to move on to the\n\n### ASK_ME_ANYTHING_QA\nwith that said , we're going to move on to the ask me anything\n\n### ASK_ME_ANYTHING_QA\nquestions\n\n### ASK_ME_ANYTHING_QA\n\n### FEATURED_COMPANY_DEEP_DIVES\nI'm aware of your position in China's equity on Chinese equities uh xbaba, but please hear me out. Outrage bull market in China. DE K be cream of the crop. Uh look man, you want to dance with the devil, you might win, but just know you can do all the work in the world and wind up with an empty bag. Obvious this looks beautifully beautiful technically. Um, it's probably going to rise. I mean, look, if you want to play with fire, just get out before the building is on fire. But, um, financially, I'm sure this is going to look incredible. But, it's not a national champion like Alibaba. So, if if BK or BEK blew up tomorrow, no one would give a And um, and that that concerns me. So if Baba was destroyed tomorrow, so would Xiinping be destroyed tomorrow and he would be out of office. So uh I'm not taking company and country risk. And you know, look, we're in a bull market, so everyone's going to get excited about all these names and they're going to make money in them for a while because it's early stage of the bull market. I'm not going to be one of them. I got all my eggs in a basket with a lot of outs that's made me a unbelievable amount of money now. and uh on the options like insane amounts of money and uh cuz we've done it we've had like multiple bites of the apple at that over the last couple of years and uh and now it's going to make me an insane amount of money also on the stock and that's going to take you know we're just excited. Okay. Um revenues look good. Share count got a little out of control. They got they reigned it back in. It's not It's not generating a good return on capital for owners. So, I don't like that. Let's take a look at the balance sheet. I'm sure it's fine. 7 billion of cash. Basically, zero debt, generates a billion dollars of cash. Yeah. Look, again, I mean, yes, but it's China and and and people are going to forget that this cycle. and there's going to be a lot of new paper issued and uh people are going to get burned, but that's three years from now. So, if you want to, you know, when the music's playing, you got to get up and dance. You can probably get away with this one for a couple years and double or triple your money. But um the hell do they do here? Housing transactions and services. So, housing coming back. It's probably early for that bet, but look, I think you're fine, Goran, but I'm not taking that gamble with you, even though I think it'll probably work for you. Um, rule number one for Look, here's here's the bottom line, Goran. If JP Morgan were going to finance you to buy the entire business, they were going to give you debt financing to buy 100% of BEK with the only caveat is you had to put 100% of your net worth as the equity slug. So if it worked, you would make not double or triple your money, but 10 or 20x your money. But if it didn't work, JP Morgan gets the business, you get wiped out, hole in the donut, you go become a greeter at Walmart, would you do the deal? And if the answer is yes, and you've done enough work that you would risk everything on it because you think you're going to make 20x, then you should buy one share. If you don't feel that way, and you're just like, China's going up, so where can I gamble and hope that it goes up with China? Uh, have at it. But, you know, eventually you're going to get taken out on a stretcher. Maybe not from BK. It'll be the next one. And BK, you'll 10x your money and you'll say, \"I'm so brilliant because, you know, I saw China was going up and I bought a leverage play and I gambled and won.\" And then you're going to say, \"Because I'm so brilliant, I'm going to gamble and win again.\" But you're not going to call it gambling. You're going to say, \"I'm a sophisticated investor.\" That's old school. They make doubles and triples. I'm new school. I make eight baggers. and you're going to put the whole damn thing in and you're going to get wiped and I'm going to be waving to you. Not when I walk into Walmart, when I drive by Walmart, cuz I don't walk into Walmart. So, that's all I have to tell you. Uh, your analysis is fine, but it's China and it's you got to understand it's a different game and you haven't been long enough to realize um that. So, dance while the music stops, but you better be damn right when the music is ending. It's not yet. It's not near, but it's coming uh in a matter of years. And it'll probably be the last time they turn on the music for a long time in China, by the way. This is the last cycle.\nInspire turnaround in healthcare. This looks pretty interesting. This is from Paul Hul Hul. Paul Hul Paul Paul's been with us for a long time. I watch his comments. I I see all your comments and your hearts and your all that stuff. And uh I see it. I appreciate it. I remember it. I'm grateful for it. And um talk about a broken growth stock. This one's going to take a long time to rebuild an institutional shareholder base. [Music] Okay, so this is a tiny company that's gone from losing money. Oh, sorry. This is the cash flow statement. Let's see what it's doing on cash flow. All right. Yeah, it's gone from burning cash to now huge inflection. Revenues are growing. Shares outstanding are growing, but not not insanely. Um, on face value, I like this a lot. Paul 445 no debt. Okay. So what do they do? Medical technology company development and commercialization of minimally invasive solutions for patients with obstructive sleep apnea. Uh provides safe treatment for moderate and severe nerve st maintain open airway. Yeah. So, I think the name of the game is, you know, what's their moat? How do they maintain their moat? What's their competition? Looks like things are going in the right direction, but you're making you're making a binary bet here. Uh, and you're kind of having to predict the future, which I don't love, but I think you probably have a decent enough margin of safety. It's worth doing more research, but you really better understand everything about the competition and the moat and talk to doctors, do channel checks, uh, find out why there's nothing else like this because, you know, this thing is in the early stages of breakdown even though the fundamentals are improving. kind of reminds me of Amazon in 2000 to 2002 when the fundamentals were improving but it was a broken growth stock and the stock fell 90% before you know it went on to do all the great things that it did. Um I think this one I'd probably explore again in the 60s or 50s. May never get it but in the meantime do your work be patient and wait for for an opportunity. I just think it's I still think it's a little early even though it's down 70 something 75%. 90% I'd be more interested. Um but good one. Good one. That's on the watch list for sure.\n Alexandre French new to the podcast and love it. Well, thank you. Welcome Alexandre Corll. CRV CRVL. How about Carell? We'll have some soft serve.

So, for this one, it's not for us, but I'll just take a look at it. Maybe you want to own it as a long-term compounder and go to the beach. seems to be uh reasonably positioned to do that. No debt, plenty of cash. Generating cash. Great income statement. Growing revenues again. Share count steady. This looks pretty okay. Let's uh see what the hell they do. Provides workers comp. Oh, I hate workers comp. Uh general and auto liability. That's great. Hospital bill auditing payment in integrity solutions AI is a care related to healthcare costs. Uh yeah, bring it back up if it gets down to like $50. But this is not it's just not there's higher and better uses of my money. I think your analysis is sound and I think the idea is okay and it probably works over time but I need doubles or triples in a few years and this is not going to be one of them.\n### ASK_ME_ANYTHING_QA\n Al Rudell ANF, I have zero interest in this stock. This is already this was a 10. This is a broken tenbagger. Um, this is where people get hurt because they buy newly broken shiny objects and they catch a falling knife at the exact wrong time. Everything looks fine. This is a broken stock. I would not be interested in this at the moment. Uh, let's move on. Um, but thank you for the question.\n### MISCELLANEOUS\nconstellation Brands this is from uh Eduardo Gonzalez. This is in the basket of um Dagio. I think I think they're all going to work. Uh but I think Dagio is going to be the highest and best use of capital. I would be less focused on um companies that have a lot of beer exposure like Corona. Modello. I mean, that's huge in Mexico, obviously, but I'd be more in the high-end, high margin spirits. So, that's that our play is Dagio in that space. Stephen Laz, I'll get back to you on that. Uh, another investor looking to come in. All right, Lars Lond, have you found your pick in the chemicals massacre? Uh, he's looking at EMN. We have enough exposure, but we we you'll know when you know. Let's just put it that way. Uh, Eastman's fine. We've covered it a couple times. It's not super dislocated, so we wouldn't be in this one. But this one will be fine long term. I don't think there's enough dislocation in this relative to the fundamental erosion for me to be interested in that. There are much better players in that space, but we've made no announcements on that. Stephen Laz. Oh, we covered that. Okay, here's another person who wants to be my video producer. I got Stephen. He's doing great, but thank you. Um, can you do a buy analysis on uh Troy Aman? Troy, we've already covered National Oil Wellvarco and we'll probably write that one up again in coming weeks. LBRT. [Music] We not only own that. So, a welcome to the podcast. Uh, we own Varco. We've talked about Varco. We've covered it in articles. Go back and look. Um, LBRT hydraulic fracking services. I mean, why would you buy this when you could buy Schlumbumberge or Hallebertton or National Oil Well, Varco? You don't need to own six of them. Pick the best and buy it. I would buy if you're going to buy services. As far as value per dollar, I think it's Varco. I don't think it's Liberty Energy. Let me just see here. got 20 million of cash and 190 million of debt. And you know, free cash flow is starting to crank. Revenues are down a little bit, but that's no problem. It's cyclical. They issued a ton of stock in the last few years. This is not for me. I I I don't like these type of people that issue a ton of stock at the wrong time. Um Daryl like Oh, Daryl. Okay. Enjoy listening to your show every week. Someone inquired about Starbucks. Uh are you still buyer? Said you'd be a buyer at $80. Uh let's see. Daryl Lyset. Uh I don't think I said 80. I think I said 60, but I don't think I'm going to get 60. I mean, look, here's a stock that's off 20 30%. I I'm not like that doesn't excite me. I don't think I don't think Starbucks is going to $200 anytime soon. So, if I can't double my money in three years, I'm not going to commit a dollar. Like, if you want, you know, dividend yielder with Brian McNichol, he's a brilliant CEO. You know, you can have $80 go to $130 in three years. That's great. But this is like this is this is a snoozefest for me. Uh great CEO, great company, not enough dislocation. If it got down to like 50 or 60, which it won't. Look, the other thing that's going to happen is commodity prices are coming down for coffee. Okay, coffee is here. We'll just cover this for you real quick. Okay, so here's coffee. This is the same story as Horell and uh every single restaurant that's getting margins killed by live cattle and feeder cattle. So in the case of uh Starbucks, here's your coffee chart.\n\n### FEATURED_COMPANY_DEEP_DIVES\nwe own Varco. We've talked about Varco. We've covered it in articles. Go back and look. Um, LBRT hydraulic fracking services. I mean, why would you buy this when you could buy Schlumbumberge or Hallebertton or National Oil Well, Varco? You don't need to own six of them.

This is the same story as Horell and uh every single restaurant that's getting margins killed by live cattle and feeder cattle. So in the case of uh Starbucks, here's your coffee chart.\n\n### HEADLINES_AND_NEWS\n\n### TECHNICAL_CHARTS\n\n### ASK_ME_ANYTHING_QA\n\n### ASK_ME_ANYTHING_QA\nwe are. We are at near record all-time high coffee prices, which is a margin compression environment for Starbucks. This looks very much like 2011. You get your top, you get your retest, and then you collapse for the next 3 or 4 years. As you collapse for the next 3 or 4 years, you can see what happened to Starbucks from 2011 to 2014. I don't even have to look at the chart to see what happened. And what you're going to find is 2011 to 2014, the stock went from $10 to $50, four baggers. So yeah, I think your timing is right. I just don't think you're going to get the multibags that I need to commit a dollar of capital. But if you want a safe stock that's marked down a few pennies that you can get on a half a sale, then that's fine.\n\nWe've covered this one a few times and I've continued to say no. Um, I think this is, you know, you've got a basically a you got a broken growth stock is what you have. And um, you know, you you have to be damn sure that their moat is impenetrable against the likes of Amazon and Google. Their revenues and free cash flow keep growing. Their margins are compressing a little bit. Um, this one has been a pass for me. I think it's going to continue to be a pass for me. I think it's very hard to understand uh how they maintain the moat. And I'm willing to be completely wrong. This would be an error of omission, not commission. I understand it looks cheap, but uh for me, when these type of things break, they tend to take an awful long time to uh build a new shareholder base. So, I'm going to pass Caesars CZ RP. Uh, interesting. My guess is they have a lot of debt to refinance yet again. Like every cycle with these casinos, revenues have been flat following COVID. Free cash flow is just barely positive. See here, revenues declining a little bit year on year. They doubled the share count in 2020 to 2021. They must have done an a big acquisition. Um yeah, and look what happened to shareholder value. Dropped 80%. free cash flow negative big time last year. Let's see about quarterly. Yeah, start to come back. So, they got 860 million of cash. They have 12 billion dollar of debt. That's a big problem. Yeah. If you're barely free cash flow positive and you got 12 billion dollars of debt that you have to refinance, they might get bailed out by the easing cycle, but that's not an ideal scenario. Let's see what they bought. Maybe they explained it to us here.\n\nMichael Costa, for a stock to look at, curious on your opinion of Lulu. Lulu is like Starbucks and Nike. Great business. Down on its luck. You know, I continue to channel check this stuff. Um, so actually, my assistant helped me understand what's going on in terms of culturally with it. I think Lulu is going to be fine. I just I I I'd never really understood the moat. Well, I did on I look, I get it, but this one's hard because the CEO was a hard charger. It's kind of like when the Under Armour was run by the founder and the thing just took off. He was hungry. Then he started buying vineyards and doing all this with horses and took his eye off the ball. Kind of same as Lulu. Um, the top design person went to Vans. I am so tempted by this one and I'm not going to do anything because I don't want overlapping correlated bets and I've already got VF and that for me is a huge winner. So, um, for that reason, I'm going to pass. But um let's just look at some numbers here. Free cash flow is great. Revenues are still growing. Shares outstanding fine. Good return on capital balance sheet. Great. I don't know. I I think you I I don't think you're going to get really hurt buying this at this level. I don't think you can be certain, but I think it's it's pretty close to the level where you you really want to be a buyer of this. I I would do some channel checks and really understand what's happening because there were some issues about what it does to hormones and like some stupid stuff was said uh uh um cultural mishaps that they did. So, you got to make an assessment whether whether that's temporary or permanent. Uh, in the case of Bud Light, the reverse version of this, it was kind of a permanent impairment, but um, most of the others have been temporary. I think this one is going to be pretty good from these levels, but it's not a pound the table one where I can make multiags. I don't think they're going to be multi-bags. You may get a bag or a bag and a half if everything goes great. Um, and that's why I prefer VFC Corp. Good question. The answer is I think you're right. Edgar Abru, uh, Lulu Louise just covered UPS. I agree and I'm not doing anything with it yet and I'm going to be okay missing it, but I definitely like UPS and I definitely have an eye on it.\n\nMichael Costa, can we look at opportunities and potential market reactions for the September Fed meeting and maybe fall season volatility? Also, maybe even talk about potential hedging strategies if it's needed. No, I think number one any volatility is going to be shortterm and you wind up just wasting 1 to 2% of equity just so you can have a short-term marktomarket benefit. It's a waste of time. Um this year uh it's not always a waste of time but uh in this year I think it is. I think, you know, we've been able to raise millions and millions of capital just with the six, five, six, and soon to be 7x in uh some of our options positions. So, we've got a lot of cash now uh that we're not needing. You know, this is cash we can put to work right away in in certain names tomorrow and we will uh and we'll have some cash. I I don't think you're going to get a lot of people missed April, so they're hoping September. They were hoping September or early October would be that April again because of recency bias. And I think they're going to be wrong. I think the market pushes too much higher. Not not much higher. I I think the market pushes higher into year end is is what I'm trying to say. And it may be masked. Maybe the indices don't do so much better. Uh but I think there going to be a lot of names that do really well. So, if we're, you know, if we're not buying PayPal at $66 because we think or Baxter or some of the others, uh, or Horell because we think that the indices, which is basically MAG 7, might stumble a little bit. I think we're making a huge mistake because if those stumble, the defensives are going to get bid. So um there are things to do right now irrespective of the Fed, irrespective of volatility. Um I don't want to miss buying a PayPal or others that were in the market aggressively on in the last few days because I'm guessing about whether the index might correct 3% or 6% or not at all or just keep moving higher. Um, you know, the reason we took a lot of profits on the options is because we're basically at at or near the max value. If you can get five and a half or 6x now and your max possible value of the spread is 7x and you got to wait 3 months and everything has to happen perfectly for one more turn. You take some off and yeah, we'll get some that'll be 7x, the full 7x, but not all, you know. and uh world's smallest violin. Elliot Simmons. It's asking me about Cholu Mexican Grill. Is there a multiple? I'd like that. I I I don't think I ever look at multiples. I look at free creek cash flow. No, I No, it's No, it's nowhere like at $30. I would take a look. It's never gonna It's very unlikely it gets to $30. I mean, here's a stock that went up 14x in seven years and now it's pulled back a little bit and people want to jump on the train. You can jump on the train. It It's a great business. I'd rather be, if I'm going to be in restaurants, I want bigger upside than a a 50% move because the restaurant business is a tough business and when these type of things break, um, it can take a little while to repair and it might be indicative of other things going on. But long-term, I would 100% bet on Chipotle and Scott Boatight. And I know all a lot of these people live here. Uh, great business, great company, great leadership. Uh, for me, I need to see massive dislocation in price for me to allocate a dollar. And this is a pullback. And and for me, I don't get enough bags by buying at this level. and and for this quality of a business, I'm probably never going to get an opportunity to buy when there's massive dislocations. So, for me, it's a pass. Uh but I generally think the business is great and it's going to continue to grow. Um here's another uh investor inquiry. I will get back to you. Thank you so much. Uh Elliot, another one. Yeah. Again, uh Scott Boatright is great. The company's great. Everything's great.\n Marco Staltari. All right. So, this guy wants to play robots through a plastic company or something. Let's take a look. I don't know what this is. I I I don't even have a ticker. If is this is like China. Send me a ticker because it's not coming up anywhere. So, um Kagra Brands. This is similar story to um Hormell. This this one hasn't come down enough for me to get interested. So, I'm going to pass. I need multi bags otherwise like I'm not I'm not interested in 50% in three years. That that doesn't move the needle. Nikolai Johnson Tech again. No, we're not going to get involved in that one. I'm sure it's fine. There's no way to really understand the moat there, but it's probably good. All right. So, here's TJ Vandermir. Uh, thanks for the podcast. Great value sharing in Europe. Thank you for that. Couple years been investing great results. Uh Baba Cooper Standard. What would you do? I' You You know what to do. Own great businesses and sit on your hands. You You already listed all the names. I mean, yeah, tune in, buy them, sit on your hands. That's what you do. Um check with your consultant first. thoughts on Tim asking about constellation again. We covered that. Jimmy Jones target getting close to consideration. Yes. Am I going to do anything about it? Probably not, but maybe. Uh, new CEO is fine. Brendan Garvey. Okay. So, this guy's saying, \"I'm in college. My uh professor is a big um poster boy for passive investing. Efficient market theory is written on his forehead. Uh D. What's something you'd say to this professor to throw him off his skates and prove that outperforming is doing? Just show them your results. I mean, if you're following what we're doing, you should be up at least three times the index and just show them your statements. That's all you need to do. But you're not going to convince someone like that. They're, you know, that their whole livelihood depends on espousing that and brainwashing you that that's the only way to go. And statistically, he's right because there's only going to be a very few number of people that can do what we do here. and uh that's why you tune in every week. So uh if he thinks the majority underperform, he's absolutely correct and he's part of the majority and he'll continue to underperform or buy an index and perform in line or buy a closet indexer and perform in line minus fees. But that's not what we do here. We do private equity in public markets. We underwrite the whole business as if we were buying the whole thing. Uh and we don't buy shares for the sake of buying shares because of some headline or some trend or some flavor of the month. Uh, Scott's Miracle Grow. Yeah, like it. By the way, don't send in more than one question a week. It's kind of selfish for other people. Uh, Lachland Neo, love your podcast. Well done on the amazing results. Thoughts on Porsche? No, we don't buy waring factions, we buy arms dealers. Lee Foster, how do you feel about Buffett's comments on the Craft Hinds de merger? Look, they screwed up. I mean, he got seduced by 5G's zerocost and uh it didn't work. So now they're going to they're in desperation. They got to do something. The brands, you know, look, they've spent 10 years working day and night to destroy two great brands. They couldn't do it. So now they're going to split them up. They're going to get two CEOs that are going to work full-time trying to destroy the brands. but they won't be able to do it because the brands are so good. So the answer to your question is buff it out. We'll remove the overhang on the stock. Hines will be fine. Craft will be fine. Oscar Meyer will be fine. They'll figure it out. And um and we'll look at it when it's separated. But uh all in I think that's going to be okay. Tom Bar for terra healthcare exposure picks and shovels ft egative free cash flow. I'm going to pass next Uh, John Reio asking about pool corp. I think you're I think you'll be okay with this one. I've looked at it. I don't think I'm going to do anything with it, but um yeah, you just want to make sure this trend is actually reversing. And so far, it's not showing signs of it yet, but on balance, this is a long-term compounder. Let's take a look at the balance sheet first. 79 million. Well, this is your problem. You got 79 million of cash. What are the receivables? 314. Okay, so they can borrow against that. I guess 900 million in debt. They've paid down some revenues are still not recovering. Let's see. Quarterly, okay, they're up year on year. That's good. She's outstanding. Okay. Um, I think you're generally okay here. I don't think there's a quick double in it, John, but I think you're generally okay. Pool Corp. Keep it on the watch list. Good job. Uh Jason Resi Honeywell spin-off. Oh, wrangled up a few last minute votes for your future Olympian. Thank you very much. By the way, if you want to This thing is like the neverending contest. She's in the quarterfinals now. If you want to vote for Annabelle each week, I think they email you. Just do the free votes. I know they have this thing where they you can pay for votes. Don't do that. Um, you'll see that once we post this video cast, we'll put the link here. If you want to vote for Annabelle Hayes for Youth Athlete of the Year, please submit your vote there. Every free vote here. Every single vote matters. We are very grateful. We know a lot of you have been getting the emails and voting every single week and we are grateful for that. She is working hard and going to have an incredible season. So, let's take a look at resi. Rezi, this thing is already breaking out. Uh, Jason, hey Jason, why weren't you bringing this to me when no one wanted it at 15? Um, you've been around for a while. You should know that. Um, yeah. Nothing not to really love here. Revenue is growing. Free cash flow is growing. Balance sheet I'm sure is fine, but I don't buy up. So, enjoy. I will not be jumping on this bandwagon, but I'm It looks like you have a pretty decent business here. Uh, but I would not be a buyer up. Next, Eric F again. Lulu, it's fine. It's just I'm not going to get a quick double. What level would you be a buyer of? Cat. It's not going to get to a level that I'd be a buyer. I'd probably be a buyer around 150 or 140 and it's not getting there anytime soon. So, I don't buy things that are way up couple standard deviations above the long-term mean. Don't do it. I sell at these levels. Gasper Mohoric, thanks for the amazing content. Uh, Western Union, I get asked every week. I'm not interested. Agri reality is a lowquality re I think gre someone is pushing the out of Western Union on social media or something. I get this question every week. Agri, I have no interest at these levels. Western Union, I know they're doing a turnaround and everyone's excited. I I I'm not interested in this stock at all. Um that's a trade. If you want to take it for the trade, you probably make a few bucks. Uh, LRN, Stride, Inc. Okay. So, you're giving me a stock that's up uh 25x. No, thank you. Welcome to the podcast, Wesley. Hang around. You're going to learn a lot. That is the antithesis of what we do here. Uh insights on American Axle, it's a it's a completely different business.

I This is not This is not one we want to be involved in. Um, Phipe Pinkos, that doesn't mean it's not going to bounce with the cycle, but it's just Cooper is a better deal. Uh, FMC, that's from Phipe Andrew Pinkos, who has been a longtime supporter. FMC. Yeah, I like FMC. Let's take a look here. This is a a play and chemicals trying to turn the corner. Not doing it yet, but when these turn, they turn really aggressively in this sector. You know the the issue is everyone's looking for a cookie cutter and the only cookie cutter is 20 or 25 years of experience and understanding what are the exceptions in each sector, each company and the only way you can get that is through a lot of experience. Um 3 billion of debt, 350 million, but they got 3 billion of receivables. Revenues are down a lot, but all everyone in this sector is sharing. Okay, it's 600 million of free cash for last year. Quarterly looks okay. What? Wait, what the hell? Sorry. Quarterly looks really good, actually. Yeah, I think this one's going to be fine. I actually really like it here.

Burden yourself with the facts. the number one podcast in the hedge fun category.\n\n### MISCELLANEOUS\n\nAnd I'm sure we'll be doing some uh some projects with him and really really grateful for that and it couldn't come out a better week with all that's been happening with Cooper Standard and Baba and all the others. So uh super excited for that. I want to thank Stephen Nellis and Aditia Sony for including me in their article on Reuters. Some\n\nPeter Lynch, when stocks are attractive, you buy them. Sure, they can go lower. I bought stocks at $12 that went to $2, but then later went on to $30. You just don't know when you can find the bottom. That's from Peter Lynch, legendary fund manager, Fidelity Mellan Fund, Bruce Cobner. Through bitter experience, I've learned that a mistaken position correlation is the root of some of the most serious problems in trading. If you have eight highly correlated positions, then you are really trading one position that is eight times as large. and those clients know obviously seeing the incredible returns that we've had and the low low correlation that we have to the indices uh has been a blessing and then the bespoke individual positions and then how we do the overlays so um super super uh excited and then Buffett I will tell you how to become rich close the doors be fearful when others are greedy be greedy when others are fearful and you know it's interesting I think so Many people apply this because they look at the indices every day and they say, \"Oh, the market is high or the market is low.\" And what they totally miss is that on every given day, the market serves up prices. And we get to decide whether or not they're correctly priced, overpriced, or misappraised. And even in a market where the tape feels frothy, if you look at what's out of favor, defensives, which by the way are going to abruptly come back into favor, and we're positioned to take advantage of that as well. Um, uh, you'd be absolutely amazed the things that can be done on a daily basis, even when when the market and the problem is is when the market is frothy, everyone crowds into the frothiest items within that, and that's how they get hurt over and over and over. they get FOMO, they chase the wrong things and uh and they're highly correlated. And here we do the exact opposite as you know, as you've been following for so many years. Uh and we're grateful for that support. And we're going to do more of it today. We've got an awful lot of stuff to cover today. I just want to uh uh give you guys a clue and understand why the smart money and the clients that have the most amount of money with me have been putting a lot more money with me. Um, and the ones that uh don't have money are saying when's the right time and this and that. Um, but have been uh really lining up for for October for sure. But I want to just kind of walk you through some of the names that we've talked about over months and years and kind of like if you step back and zoom out and understand where we are in the process. We're not chasing the Palunteers. We're not chasing the Nvidas. We're not chasing some of the ones that are at at levels where I'd be very very nervous every night going to sleep. Um, we're we're in the ones that are just getting started. Now, you take a look at Advanced Auto Parts, which is up double off the lows in a few months. Sure, could it consolidate for, you know, four, six weeks before making the next move to 100? Sure, uh, before it doubles again. Um, but this is not a stock that you're buying at the top. This is a stock you're buying close to the bottom. You know, even Baba, look at this move from 64, actually 55 to now 155. Um, more than beyond more than double, even now double off the basis. We brought the basis down to to 82 and change. And by the way, you know, it's unbelievable. We got a ton of options expiring in uh in January that were spreads that we bought between 65 and 70, and we were taking off. You know, the max expected value on those is 7x. And we were taking off a ton, millions upon millions of dollars between 5 and a half and 6x. So, we could wait for the seventh X. But when you're up 450 to 550% on millions upon millions of million, you ring the register. Did we sell one single share? No. the the move in Alibaba is just beginning, but it's so far past the spread of our strikes when we bought at 65 and 70 cents when everyone was puking in the hole and now we can sell close to $4. Uh, you know, you don't want to be a pig waiting for that fifth and then you get, you know, a little pullback before January or whatever. And we'll we have a ton ton left to to get 450 and even $5. We'll have some that that uh we just allow to expire at max value of 7x. But if we're getting out at 6.25 six times the our money on a huge huge enormous position and and what's so unbelievable, it's not just, you know, it's not just being right in the right stock because the stocks, you know, that's great. We're up double, but the expression of how we do this is like all of the returns. if we were just buying eight stocks and waiting like, okay, that's great. We do better. You know, we get our doubles and triples uh over a couple years. It's not that. It's this it's the secret sauce of what we're doing with the uh overlays that is generating huge amounts of return with very little amount of excess risk. And um the amount of money that we've made in Baba with the POS with the move not even halfway done um is just staggering. And we booked a ton of that and and we got a ton more to book between now in January. But you know, we've got so many multiples of our money off the table um uh just from what we've been able to harvest at uh not the full seven times, but the five and a half, six plus times. it. The point that I'm trying to make to you ladies and gentlemen is if you follow a sound framework and you get um and you're patient and you don't trade on margin and um you know for my clients especially that hung in there and are getting so unbelievably rewarded um you earned it. And that's, you know, what we say since the beginning is they don't give away multiaggers for free. Okay. Was it fun, you know, buying uh Cooper Standard at $5 and change and watching it go to 3.85 before going to 15 before dropping back to 9 before going to 25 before dropping back to 13 and now at, you know, whatever it is. What the hell is it? it's at uh almost $40 and on its way to 80 and beyond. Uh but that's why you're rewarded and that's why most people aren't. You know, they buy things up like, you know, the shiniest objects and then they miss a quarter and the stock's down 40% and they did it on margin and they blow themselves up and uh because they don't know what they owned. Backter, does this look like it's it's it's you're you're buying it frothy? Like if the market corrected 15% next month, my money is that not only would this not correct 15%. This would probably be up 20 to 30% because it's a defensive uh and you can see it did the exact same thing in the early 2000s. It has these cyclical dramatic flushes uncertainty over healthcare and then it works its way back up to new highs and this will be a four bagger. Uh and we've been loading out. Look at, you know, Cooper standard. People like, \"Oh, it's too high.\" Well, deconstruct it and you tell me if if we get to, forget 18 million, which is what we hit every cycle for the last 45 years. If we get to 17 million shares, the thing earns 10 to12. So, you know, is a 10 times multiple too rich on on on 1012? That's $120 stock. What if it gets to a 20 times multiple like it did back here? 140. Oh, should I invest? You know, the market's frothy. Depends what you're buying. Disney, we've had a huge move in there. We bought a ton at 85, so it's 120, 117. This thing hasn't even started. This is going to work its way to new highs. Streaming is profitable. They got a moat around their businesses, the parks, the cruises, the whole thing. Generrack has had it double over the last couple of months. This is just beginning its cycle. This is going to go work its way back 200, 300, and beyond. and maybe back to new highs with what's happening with the um uh data center business that we covered in in recent weeks. Intel, we've got gone through this. Do you think you're overpaying here? I mean, this is early days. We're going to talk a little bit about that this week. government's going to force force people to take stuff implicit coercion to take Intel's 14A stuff and sign up for big orders and you are going to see this thing back over 60 back over a 100red and beyond as this thing works out over time small caps. Okay, now people are getting interested that it's just breaking out to all-time highs after this, you know, cup and handle for all the technicians. Measured move implies another $90. So that would be 243. Uh so 34 330 minimum and and this is just early days for small caps. We've been talking about it. All you got skeptical on me here when we were just buying everything under the sun and now here we are breaking out to new highs. Same with regional banks. Everyone was chasing the megas. The regionals are just breaking out. You're going to see a huge amount of consolidation. PayPal. This thing is generating more cash than they know what to do with. This one is going to be another Alibaba where you're you get patient. You know, here we Let's just pull it up again for the 87th time. You know what? We're going to skip commodities today. We'll do them next week because we got too many\n\n### MACRO_DATA_SLIDES\nUS equity inflows still dominating year to date. China big move. So China has got the most performance 3 to one over the US and they have the least inflows. It's like the money is just going to be cascading there. Once you get the Xi handshake, if you think the move to 155 was exciting, wait till you see what happens after this. Uh market typically rises when Fed resumes cutting alongside a growing economy. We agree. Uh Athletic Apparel stocks, Lulu, Nike, VF Corp. They've all been weak. These are going to absolutely rip higher. The reason we don't own Nike and not taking a serious look at Lulu is because we have VFC Corp. The reason we have VF Corp is a huge bet on Bracken who had the 28 bagger at the Logitech turnaround is doing an incredible job doing everything he says and he had a lot more outs. He had the Supreme which helped deliver the balance sheet. He's got five other brands a lot of things he can buy and sell in this environment and he will uh and we don't want to be correlated going back to the Bruce Cner quote. So overcorrelated we we've got our exposure in that group. Um keep looking at Dow haven't done anything yet. keep looking at Centine. They just have too much of that Medicaid expo exposure, but it's interesting at these levels because it's pricing that it's like going out of business and it's not. Um seasonality of September, you tend to get a bump early, a little volatility at the end before the year- end rally. Um this shows September versus the rate cut. Contrary to consensus, we think September is going to be an up month. And that's because the Fed been on hold all year and is going to cut for the first time in September. That's only happened twice in the last 50 years. And markets did well both times. Uh so you see the cut starts. This would probably be the better analog, which was 2024, the cut starts, and you get follow through. Car dealership guy, automaker, winners and losers in August. You see a lot of these guys. Toyota up 14%. Honda, Ford is up. SUVs, crossovers, and hybrids continue to carry the market. Household leverage is at a 50-year low. This is unbelievable. This $35 trillion of trapped equity helock game is going to be on. That's going to be consumer mania, restaurant mania, housing mania. It and and these haven't even started. Russell large cap value benchmark is close to a record discount to growth by uh PE ratio going back to when? 2021. This is going to be so much fun the next 5 to seven years. We are going to make so much money. It's going to be insane. Um if by the way most of you are already smiling. So why do you eat four bananas sideways this year? I mean, borrow my glasses. What's going to take place in the next five years is going to be unreal. And um okay, Fed cut equals expansion. That's fun. Here's what the period we're in right now. Kind of bouncing up to the high end of the range, get a little bit of consolidation, year-end rally. That's normal this time of year. So, next couple of weeks, we'll be talking about that consolidation. Those of you who have new money in, we'll be able to take advantage of that. Um, Russell 2000 small cap flows just beginning. You can see here as it's breaking out to new highs. Mainland cap cap China capital inflows into Hong Kong stocks have reached 1 trillion Hong Kong dollars so far this year. Divide that by 850 billion. That's exciting. Speculators are net short across US stock futures. Um, yeah, that's unreal. I mean, that's that's why it's hard to say we're gonna like see any meaningful pullback in September and October beyond, you know, a normal garden variety 5 to 8% which I don't even think uh you'll get as much as that because people are just so skeptical and they so missed so much. So, they're going to just they're going to have to buy the unmagnificent 493 to just they're going to have to buy every single weakness into year end. uh elevated pipeline of deals with issuance. Uh buy performance and buyback aristocrats versus equal weight gross and net buybacks. We have this Russell 2000 just getting ready to break out again. And when they break out, it's it's it's usually multiple multiple years, not weeks or months. Large stocks haven't always dominated the markets. Um, you can see the cycles we've done this international versus US. Small, you can see here the biggest rally in the shortest amount of time from 2000 to 2006. This is where we are, ladies and gentlemen. In my view, you see it in the 70s. You also see it in the early 90s. Uh, which is midcycle, which we've been saying we're probably midcycle another 9 years or so till 2032, 2034. uh until the millennials age up to um early to mid-40s and their spending slows down. Um Alibaba's short interest declines after new chip report. Shorts getting squeezed left and right. European and UK value stocks are now ahead of the S&P 500 over the past 1, three, and five years. How do you like that? Early industry gains drove the largest productivity booms. Today's productivity is historically low. That's going to help regular businesses. All this AI stuff. Wait till you see how it applies to the most boring businesses in the 493. And you're going to your minds are going to be blown with all the flows into China with all the move in China. You can see here it's just now breaking out of this long cup and handle. Uh short interest is just rolling over. Emerging market stocks traded highest level since 2021. We've been pounding the table on that for a while. Two years now. Now we look like everyone's saying, \"Wow, great job down here.\" People were saying you're don't know what you're talking about. said the dollar was going to weaken. People said you don't know what you're talking about. And uh those of you who tuned in every week knew we were knew what we were talking about and you've reaped the benefits. Um BLS erases 911,000 jobs and largest revision on record. That's unbelievable. says the largest revision on record since the Obama administration 2009 and 2010. Alibaba Hong Kong stock price and net flow from southbound stock connect. This was part of our core thesis last August. We were saying it's coming, it's coming. There were no signs of it and now it's all come at once. Alibaba share price has surged since hitting lows last year. here. That's the front page of the Financial Times. S&P 500 trend channel since October 2022. Low end of the trend channel. Top end is well over 7,000. Commercial CNI loans just starting. Restaurant year-on-year spending growth accelerated month-on-month from 2.5 in July to 3.7 in August. Wait till people start tapping those helocks. Uh producer price changes. We'll cover that. Came in a lot. PPI came in a lot lower than expected. That's a lead indicator. The um Fed could go 50 bips without blinking an eye, but they won't. They'll do 25 and then they'll have to play catch-up later. And hopefully it's not too late. Returns after first Fed cuts. S&P past 12 month after starting with cutting cycles. Earnings growth multiple expansion 9.6%. Data center power demand is projected to increase 165% by 2030. There's your comtock. There's your range resources. There's your gener backup CNI generators for the data centers. weight of tech as a percent of total market. I don't want to be overweight tech here, guys. You're going to get hurt. It's just a matter of when. Maybe it goes up another three years. So, kudos to you. You gamble and win, but eventually they're going to take you out on the stretcher. Equal weight versus cap weight. This is a level if you're not a buyer, you're going to miss the boat. You're already seeing it this year. CPI subdued. Okay, so that's the point, ladies and gentlemen. You're here on Baba breaking out of denial into the parabolic move. You're right down here for PayPal getting ready to hit denial and then we'll start to go parabolic by year end, end of year. Still a lot of stock we can buy in that one. A lot. And then the overlays is going to be the bigger deal. Here's overall index barometers that we take a look at each day and each week just to kind of get a feel for where we're at. I'm looking at the option skew. It's getting a little bit elevated, but not at a level where I'd get very very nervous about a big major sell-off. Paying attention to it, but um pretty comfortable with these levels. option skew. For those of you who haven't been around for a while, basically the cost to ensure catastrophic events, one and two standard deviation moves down, uh, call it 10% plus out of the money index puts versus VIX is at the money.\n### MISCELLANEOUS\n\n### MACRO_DATA_SLIDES\ndefensives uh staples, energy, healthcare, and utilities um relative to the the tech. And you can see the inverse relationship at an inflection point. Now, uh cyclical versus defensive flows since the October uh since the April 8th low. And high y high dividend yield still cheap and underowned, the cheapest since 2001. We've covered this. It's starting to this is going to be a core theme for the next 24 months. You're going to see it happening. Dividend yield is neglected by active managers. A key driver of this view is the fact that dividend yield remains cheap and neglected, a trend we've we expect to reverse quickly as the Fed enters this easing cycle once rate cuts begin. The 7.4 trillion sitting on the sidelines earning 4% risk-f free will be forced to find yield elsewhere. When that happens, these sleepy, boring dividend payers will be in high demand, triggering a rotation that brings defenses back into vogue and will be more than happy to help investors get exposure. Two of the names we believe are well positioned to benefit from this rotation and the focus of this week's article are Hormel and Dagio.\n### FEATURED_COMPANY_DEEP_DIVES\nHormel just reported his fastest topline growth in nearly 3 years plus 6% yearonear. Let me repeat that. Fastest topline growth in nearly 3 years. 6% yearonear as the protein craze continues to show no signs of slowing. Unfortunately, a steep and unexpected rise in commodity costs caught Horell off sides, erasing much of that benefit and putting earnings under pressure. Par for the course this earnings season, the market overreacted, sending shares down 13%, we were in the market buying as many shares as we could. And for those who sold us shares in the whole, we thank you for your service. So you can see here hogs they do you know bacon and all that stuff live cattle horell dinty beef stew uh and feeder cattle has gone parabolic it's now starting to break down when these commodities break like you saw in 2014 and you in live and feeder they don't break down a little they break down abruptly and the trend continues for three years that's when you're going to see the restaurant stocks the horses of the world absolutely go straight up at the End of the day, Hormel has been compounding wealth since 1891, not 2021, 1891. They've been doing this for a while, ladies and gentlemen. To think this is the first time it has faced rising input costs over 130 years is laughable. As it has done many times before, Hormeell will work through a handful of quarters of margin volatility while passing through costs. Zoom out and this will be nothing more than a blip on the radar. On top of that, you have a proven CEO, Jeff Edinger, back at the helm to write the ship through October 2026 with plenty of time to work his magic and position the new CEO to step in as a hero. In the meantime, we'll continue to add shares where we can collect the five 4.5% dividend yield and growing by the way and watch this sleepy name recover. Okay, under Etinger last tenure during 11 years he had an a five bagger in 11 years. He came in when the stock was $7. He left when the stock was $38. Uh I think he's going to have at least a double if not a triple. Uh but probably between now and 2026, probably a double. Uh and then the new CEO will take it from there. In the meantime, you get a growing dividend yield and you get to lock in that dividend yield. And the reason that's important is because they are a dividend aristocrat. So, not only are you locking in that yield, but it keeps growing every single year. And when you can lock in a 4.5% dividend yield on Hormeell, uh, you know, 10 years from now, you're you've got a 10% yield on your basis and you've got a triple stock and a and a a perennial compounder for 130 plus years. So, we've highlighted some of the key points. They've had 59 consecutive years of dividend increases, 97 years of dividend payments without interruption. Their dividend yield grows at a 5% compound annual growth rate. So basically every uh 12 every 14 years the dividend doubles at that pace. So in 14 years you'd be getting a 9% yield on your basis and growing. So call it, you know, 15, 16 years, your dividend will have doubled. The stock will have probably quadrupled. Uh and uh and your income keeps going up every year above the pace of inflation. It's unbelievable. Uh and people are clamoring to buy tea bills. So they took their sales guidance up from 2.1 billion to 2.15 billion mean uh net sales organic net sales growth up 2.3 2 to 3% operating income growth up 5 to 7%. 10 key points organic net sales rose 6% year-on-year to 3.3 3.03 03 billion accelerating for the third straight quarter and sharply above Q2's 1% growth. Growth was driven by volume plus 3% and pricing plus 2% and positive performance across all three segments. Two adjusted operating margins fell 80 basis points yearon-year to 8.4% as steep runup in commodity inflation completely eroded the benefits from the strong runup in topline growth. Beef costs remain near all-time highs. Pork bellies are up 30%, wholesale pork up 10%, driving a 400 basis points increase in raw material cost inflation in Q3 alone. Management is implementing targeted pricing actions and evaluating additional measures with profit recovery expected to lag into next year as cost pressures persist in Q4 and price hikes only partially benefit the the upcoming quarter. However, this is not the first time Hormell has faced high commodity prices in it 130 year operating history. They have a track record of successfully passing on costs in the past and we expect this time will be no different. Number three, the transform and modernize initiative rem remains on track delivering results in line with management expectations of 90 b 90 projects contributing measurable val value and earnings. Management continues to expect incremental benefits for fiscal years 2025 of 100 to 150 million is currently tracking toward the high end of the range. Retail segment delivered 5% volume growth, 5% net sales growth and segments of profit uh and segment profits of negative4%. Topline strength was broad-based with five of six brands posting year-on-year growth. Geno was a standout, up 13% year-on-year, continuing to outpace the broader category and gain market share on top of its number one position. Spam also delivered another quarter year-on-year volume and net sales growth. Segment profitability was pressured by input costs with management expecting profits to begin to recover in 2026 as pricing actions take effect. The food service segment delivered 2% organic volume growth, 7% organic net sales growth, and segment profits down 1% year-on-year. Hormemell outpaced the broader industry despite ongoing pressure, including declining restaurant traffic and soft, higher margin convenience store visits. Premium pepperoni was a standout, posting over 20% volume growth. Management expects the pass through nature of costs in the food service portfolio to drive a faster recovery of profitability, which is key as the segment typically commands mid- teens operating margin versus high single digits at retail. Six, the international segment delivered 8% volume growth, 6% net sales growth, but its segment profitability fell 13% year-on-year. Topline strength was driven by thriving Chinese market and positive export results led by chi global the the global spam brand profitability was primarily impacted by ongoing competitive pressures in Brazil. Seven Planters acquired by Hormel in 2021 for 3.35 billion continues its turnaround achieving higher year-on-year growth in distribution, household penetration, and turning dollar sales positive by quarter end with capacity now in place to meet demand. Management expects continued sales momentum. On the bottom line, profit recovery is lagging expectations, though Q3 profit did grow, albeit more slowly, than topline gains. Eight. Management continues to prioritize the company's dividend aristocrat status, returning $159 million to shareholders this quarter alone through dividend payments, bringing total dividends to $474 million through Q3. This marks 59 consecutive years of dividend increases and the 388th consecutive quarterly dividend with a 5-year dividend growth kagger of 5%. Capex for the quarter totaled 72 million or 2.4% of net sales up from 65 million last year. The largest investments remain focused on expanding capacity and optimizing the manufacturing footprint with management forecasting fullear capex of 300 million. And 10 management revised fullear guidance narrowing net sales to 2.15 billion from 2.1 billion implying 2 to 3% organic net sales growth due to steep commodity cost increases. Adjusted operating income is now expected at 1.05 5 to 1.07 billion with adjusted EPS midpoint reduced to 1.44 from 1.63. Most importantly, management reiterated that long-term algorithm remains intact. 2 to 3% organic net sales\nStill generating 2.7 billion of free cash. Now moving on to Dagio. This is yet another straw hat. Buying straw hats in the winter. That's what we like to do, ladies and gentlemen. We buy straw hats when no one wants them in the wintertime. And then when everyone wants them in the summertime, uh we sell them at double. Shares have been cut in half as if consumers will never drink again. We're more than happy to take the other side of that trade. While consumers may be moderating, the real trend is clear. They are drinking less but drinking better. No company is better positioned to capitalize on this long-term premium immization than Diagio. Dagio is a classic story of cyclical downturns playing out within a long-term secular uptrend and we expect this cycle to be no different. The number one thing we can look for in a turnaround is free cash flow recovering and that is already well underway with management targeting $3 billion of free cash flow for the coming year. In the meantime, as management waits for the inevitable cycle to turn, they continue to focus on what they can control, cutting costs and positioning the company for the next leg of growth. Zoom out a few years and Dagio will be leaner, stronger, and benefiting from margin tailwinds tied to premiumization. It will be growing at a mid singledigit clip and trading above $200 tomorrow. In our opinion, again, you're at hedge fun.com. Uh, scroll to the top, click on terms. This is all opinion, not advice. Consult with your financial advisor, psychic, guru, magic eightball, whatever you need to do before doing anything. Let's go here. Number one thing we look for is free cash flow coming in in the meantime. Ah, okay. Mids singledigit clip trading above 200 tomorrow's newspaper today. Until then, we sit on our hands and collect our 4% dividend and wait. Top 10 uh points. Number one, organic net sales rose 1.7% ahead of street consensus of 1.4 driven by.9% volume growth and8 price mix growth. Management noted that the tariff driven pull forward behind last quarter's 5.9% year-on-year growth has largely cycled through with inventory levels now normalized. Number two, Diagio gained or maintained share in 65% of total net sales across measured markets including the US and delivered organic growth in four or five regions. Sales rose 1.5% in North America, 9.2% in Latin America and Caribbean. If you remember, that's where they had all the problems when the stock tanked. Uh so that's now recovering.3% in Europe, 10.5% in Africa, while Asia-Pacific declined 3.2% on weaker China and travel retail. I can tell you one thing in Africa where they've got 10.5% growth they're not worried about ompic and they're not worried about uh zero calorie zero alcohol Dagio they're selling the real stuff and they're selling it by the boatload three Guinness remained a standout during the quarter delivering 13% organic net sales growth and gaining share in its top three markets Great Britain Ireland and the US Guinness 0.0 Zero continues to expand, driving 40% growth in Diagio's non-alcoholic portfolio, where the company leads the market at four times the size of its nearest competitor. Don Julio was another highlight, up 38% organically and gaining share in 90% plus of measured markets. Number four, management raised its cost savings target under the Accelerate program to $625 million from $500 million over three years. 50% of the savings are expected to flow through to the bottom line, supporting mids singledigit organic operating profit growth for fiscal year 2026 and sustaining a 29% sectorle leading EBIT margin with the remainder reinvested for growth. Diagio generated 2.75 billion in free cash flow for the year, up 139 million year. Improving cash flow remains a top priority for management with guidance for at least $3 billion annually starting in 2026, which includes a one-time accelerate program cost with upside potential as the business recover at current prices. This implies free cash flow yield of at least 5%. Six, cleaning up the balance sheet remains a top priority with DI Dagio ending the quarter with 21.9 billion in net debt and 3.4 times net leverage ratio in line with prior guidance of 3.3 to 3.5. management retrain remains on track to hit 2.5 to three times net debt to IBID target by fiscal year 2028 at the latest seven% of Dagio's business is unaffected by US tariffs with most products exempt under USMCA management expects a $200 million annualized operating profit hit but aims to mitigate 50% in year one before broader tariff specific pricing actions Eight management expects capex of 1.2 to 1.3 billion for the coming year, down from 1.5 in fiscal year 2025 as they continue to focus on improving return on invested capital and higher growth opportunities over the next three years. Capex is projected to decline to a mid singledigit percent of next sales versus 7.7 in fiscal year 20259. Diagio has a track record of active portfolio management and remains committed to pursuing disposals of non-core assets. However, despite earlier rumors, management has no plans to sell Guinness or its stake in Moet Hennessy at this time 10 for fiscal year 2026. Management expects organic net se sales growth near fiscal 2025 levels uh ne negative one uh which is 1.7% with slowly slightly negative first half and accelerating second half which would imply organic sales growth in the 4% range. They anticipate a return to positive operating leverage as cost savings kick in driving mids singledigit organic profit growth which includes the current impact of tariffs. So that's the story there. Can read all the key highlights from the earnings call. Fear and greed is at neutral levels. National Association of Active Investment Managers a little fear in there. Healthcare top 30 weights revised down 2.44%. That's why people are so bearish on it. The biggest downward revisions have been the insurers like Elevance, Sigma, UNH, and then a few drug companies. But for the most part, on a company by company basis, most of them have been revised up. PPI, as we discussed, was expected to come in at 3.3%, came in at 2.6%. That's a preview of coming attractions. They might be late with these cuts, but if they if they get caught up quickly, it'll be fine. You can see earnings are now back over not only at 300, but remember they got down to like 293 for next year. They're now at 303. Uh,\n\n### FEATURED_COMPANY_DEEP_DIVES\nI'm aware of your position in China's equity on Chinese equities uh xbaba, but please hear me out. Outrage bull market in China. DE K be cream of the crop. Uh look man, you want to dance with the devil, you might win, but just know you can do all the work in the world and wind up with an empty bag. Obvious this looks beautifully beautiful technically. Um, it's probably going to rise. I mean, look, if you want to play with fire, just get out before the building is on fire. But, um, financially, I'm sure this is going to look incredible. But, it's not a national champion like Alibaba. So, if if BK or BEK blew up tomorrow, no one would give a And um, and that that concerns me. So if Baba was destroyed tomorrow, so would Xiinping be destroyed tomorrow and he would be out of office. So uh I'm not taking company and country risk. And you know, look, we're in a bull market, so everyone's going to get excited about all these names and they're going to make money in them for a while because it's early stage of the bull market. I'm not going to be one of them. I got all my eggs in a basket with a lot of outs that's made me a unbelievable amount of money now. and uh on the options like insane amounts of money and uh cuz we've done it we've had like multiple bites of the apple at that over the last couple of years and uh and now it's going to make me an insane amount of money also on the stock and that's going to take you know we're just excited. Okay. Um revenues look good. Share count got a little out of control. They got they reigned it back in. It's not It's not generating a good return on capital for owners. So, I don't like that. Let's take a look at the balance sheet. I'm sure it's fine. 7 billion of cash. Basically, zero debt, generates a billion dollars of cash. Yeah. Look, again, I mean, yes, but it's China and and and people are going to forget that this cycle. and there's going to be a lot of new paper issued and uh people are going to get burned, but that's three years from now. So, if you want to, you know, when the music's playing, you got to get up and dance. You can probably get away with this one for a couple years and double or triple your money. But um the hell do they do here? Housing transactions and services. So, housing coming back. It's probably early for that bet, but look, I think you're fine, Goran, but I'm not taking that gamble with you, even though I think it'll probably work for you. Um, rule number one for Look, here's here's the bottom line, Goran. If JP Morgan were going to finance you to buy the entire business, they were going to give you debt financing to buy 100% of BEK with the only caveat is you had to put 100% of your net worth as the equity slug. So if it worked, you would make not double or triple your money, but 10 or 20x your money. But if it didn't work, JP Morgan gets the business, you get wiped out, hole in the donut, you go become a greeter at Walmart, would you do the deal? And if the answer is yes, and you've done enough work that you would risk everything on it because you think you're going to make 20x, then you should buy one share. If you don't feel that way, and you're just like, China's going up, so where can I gamble and hope that it goes up with China? Uh, have at it. But, you know, eventually you're going to get taken out on a stretcher. Maybe not from BK. It'll be the next one. And BK, you'll 10x your money and you'll say, \"I'm so brilliant because, you know, I saw China was going up and I bought a leverage play and I gambled and won.\" And then you're going to say, \"Because I'm so brilliant, I'm going to gamble and win again.\" But you're not going to call it gambling. You're going to say, \"I'm a sophisticated investor.\" That's old school. They make doubles and triples. I'm new school. I make eight baggers. and you're going to put the whole damn thing in and you're going to get wiped and I'm going to be waving to you. Not when I walk into Walmart, when I drive by Walmart, cuz I don't walk into Walmart. So, that's all I have to tell you. Uh, your analysis is fine, but it's China and it's you got to understand it's a different game and you haven't been long enough to realize um that. So, dance while the music stops, but you better be damn right when the music is ending. It's not yet. It's not near, but it's coming uh in a matter of years. And it'll probably be the last time they turn on the music for a long time in China, by the way. This is the last cycle.\nInspire turnaround in healthcare. This looks pretty interesting. This is from Paul Hul Hul. Paul Hul Paul Paul's been with us for a long time. I watch his comments. I I see all your comments and your hearts and your all that stuff. And uh I see it. I appreciate it. I remember it. I'm grateful for it. And um talk about a broken growth stock. This one's going to take a long time to rebuild an institutional shareholder base. [Music] Okay, so this is a tiny company that's gone from losing money. Oh, sorry. This is the cash flow statement. Let's see what it's doing on cash flow. All right. Yeah, it's gone from burning cash to now huge inflection. Revenues are growing. Shares outstanding are growing, but not not insanely. Um, on face value, I like this a lot. Paul 445 no debt. Okay. So what do they do? Medical technology company development and commercialization of minimally invasive solutions for patients with obstructive sleep apnea. Uh provides safe treatment for moderate and severe nerve st maintain open airway. Yeah. So, I think the name of the game is, you know, what's their moat? How do they maintain their moat? What's their competition? Looks like things are going in the right direction, but you're making you're making a binary bet here. Uh, and you're kind of having to predict the future, which I don't love, but I think you probably have a decent enough margin of safety. It's worth doing more research, but you really better understand everything about the competition and the moat and talk to doctors, do channel checks, uh, find out why there's nothing else like this because, you know, this thing is in the early stages of breakdown even though the fundamentals are improving. kind of reminds me of Amazon in 2000 to 2002 when the fundamentals were improving but it was a broken growth stock and the stock fell 90% before you know it went on to do all the great things that it did. Um I think this one I'd probably explore again in the 60s or 50s. May never get it but in the meantime do your work be patient and wait for for an opportunity. I just think it's I still think it's a little early even though it's down 70 something 75%. 90% I'd be more interested. Um but good one. Good one. That's on the watch list for sure.\n Alexandre French new to the podcast and love it. Well, thank you. Welcome Alexandre Corll. CRV CRVL. How about Carell? We'll have some soft serve. I mean, this thing is barely off its highs. This looks like a long-term compounder. This is not what we do. We We look for massive dislocation. This is nowhere near that. So, for this one, it's not for us, but I'll just take a look at it. Maybe you want to own it as a long-term compounder and go to the beach. seems to be uh reasonably positioned to do that.

I mean, that's huge in Mexico, obviously, but I'd be more in the high-end, high margin spirits. So, that's that our play is Dagio in that space. Stephen Laz, I'll get back to you on that.

We have enough exposure, but we we you'll know when you know. Let's just put it that way. Uh, Eastman's fine. We've covered it a couple times. It's not super dislocated, so we wouldn't be in this one. But this one will be fine long term. I don't think there's enough dislocation in this relative to the fundamental erosion for me to be interested in that. There are much better players in that space, but we've made no announcements on that. Stephen Laz. Oh, we covered that. Okay, here's another person who wants to be my video producer. I got Stephen. He's doing great, but thank you. Um, can you do a buy analysis on uh Troy Aman? Troy, we've already covered National Oil Wellvarco and we'll probably write that one up again in coming weeks. LBRT.

I mean, why would you buy this when you could buy Schlumbumberge or Hallebertton or National Oil Well, Varco? You don't need to own six of them. Pick the best and buy it. I would buy if you're going to buy services. As far as value per dollar, I think it's Varco. I don't think it's Liberty Energy. Let me just see here. got 20 million of cash and 190 million of debt. And you know, free cash flow is starting to crank. Revenues are down a little bit, but that's no problem. It's cyclical. They issued a ton of stock in the last few years. This is not for me.

I mean, look, here's a stock that's off 20 30%. I I'm not like that doesn't excite me. I don't think I don't think Starbucks is going to $200 anytime soon. So, if I can't double my money in three years, I'm not going to commit a dollar. Like, if you want, you know, dividend yielder with Brian McNichol, he's a brilliant CEO. You know, you can have $80 go to $130 in three years. That's great. But this is like this is this is a snoozefest for me. Uh great CEO, great company, not enough dislocation. If it got down to like 50 or 60, which it won't. Look, the other thing that's going to happen is commodity prices are coming down for coffee. Okay, coffee is here.

You don't get customers, your your your 9 billion is evaporated.\" And uh I think they knew that prior to inking the deal. And I think it's a quid proquo. And I think there's going to be an awful lot of pressure uh to push orders into this 14A in 2026. And once that game starts, you got a multibagger. It's just a question of how many bags you want.

    "QUOTES_OF_THE_WEEK": "\n\n### QUOTES_OF_THE_WEEK\nI want to thank Stephen Nellis and Aditia Sony for including me in their article on Reuters.\n\n### QUOTES_OF_THE_WEEK\n\nPeter Lynch, when stocks are attractive, you buy them. Sure, they can go lower. I bought stocks at $12 that went to $2, but then later went on to $30. You just don't know when you can find the bottom. That's from Peter Lynch, legendary fund manager, Fidelity Mellan Fund, Bruce Cobner. Through bitter experience, I've learned that a mistaken position correlation is the root of some of the most serious problems in trading. If you have eight highly correlated positions, then you are really trading one position that is eight times as large. and those clients know obviously seeing the incredible returns that we've had and the low low correlation that we have to the indices uh has been a blessing and then the bespoke individual positions and then how we do the overlays so um super super uh excited and then Buffett I will tell you how to become rich close the doors be fearful when others are greedy be greedy when others are fearful and you know it's interesting I think so Many people apply this because they look at the indices every day and they say, \"Oh, the market is high or the market is low.\" And what they totally miss is that on every given day, the market serves up prices. And we get to decide whether or not they're correctly priced, overpriced, or misappraised. And even in a market where the tape feels frothy, if you look at what's out of favor, defensives, which by the way are going to abruptly come back into favor, and we're positioned to take advantage of that as well. Um, uh, you'd be absolutely amazed the things that can be done on a daily basis, even when when the market and the problem is is when the market is frothy, everyone crowds into the frothiest items within that, and that's how they get hurt over and over and over. they get FOMO, they chase the wrong things and uh and they're highly correlated. And here we do the exact opposite as you know, as you've been following for so many years. Uh and we're grateful for that support. And we're going to do more of it today. We've got an awful lot of stuff to cover today. I just want to uh uh give you guys a clue and understand why the smart money and the clients that have the most amount of money with me have been putting a lot more money with me. Um, and the ones that uh don't have money are saying when's the right time and this and that. Um, but have been uh really lining up for for October for sure. But I want to just kind of walk you through some of the names that we've talked about over months and years and kind of like if you step back and zoom out and understand where we are in the process. We're not chasing the Palunteers. We're not chasing the Nvidas. We're not chasing some of the ones that are at at levels where I'd be very very nervous every night going to sleep. Um, we're we're in the ones that are just getting started. Now, you take a look at Advanced Auto Parts, which is up double off the lows in a few months. Sure, could it consolidate for, you know, four, six weeks before making the next move to 100? Sure, uh, before it doubles again. Um, but this is not a stock that you're buying at the top. This is a stock you're buying close to the bottom. You know, even Baba, look at this move from 64, actually 55 to now 155. Um, more than beyond more than double, even now double off the basis. We brought the basis down to to 82 and change. And by the way, you know, it's unbelievable. We got a ton of options expiring in uh in January that were spreads that we bought between 65 and 70, and we were taking off. You know, the max expected value on those is 7x. And we were taking off a ton, millions upon millions of dollars between 5 and a half and 6x. So, we could wait for the seventh X. But when you're up 450 to 550% on millions upon millions of million, you ring the register. Did we sell one single share? No. the the move in Alibaba is just beginning, but it's so far past the spread of our strikes when we bought at 65 and 70 cents when everyone was puking in the hole and now we can sell close to $4. Uh, you know, you don't want to be a pig waiting for that fifth and then you get, you know, a little pullback before January or whatever. And we'll we have a ton ton left to to get 450 and even $5. We'll have some that that uh we just allow to expire at max value of 7x. But if we're getting out at 6.25 six times the our money on a huge huge enormous position and and what's so unbelievable, it's not just, you know, it's not just being right in the right stock because the stocks, you know, that's great. We're up double, but the expression of how we do this is like all of the returns. if we were just buying eight stocks and waiting like, okay, that's great. We do better. You know, we get our doubles and triples uh over a couple years. It's not that. It's this it's the secret sauce of what we're doing with the uh overlays that is generating huge amounts of return with very little amount of excess risk. And um the amount of money that we've made in Baba with the POS with the move not even halfway done um is just staggering. And we booked a ton of that and and we got a ton more to book between now in January. But you know, we've got so many multiples of our money off the table um uh just from what we've been able to harvest at uh not the full seven times, but the five and a half, six plus times. it. The point that I'm trying to make to you ladies and gentlemen is if you follow a sound framework and you get um and you're patient and you don't trade on margin and um you know for my clients especially that hung in there and are getting so unbelievably rewarded um you earned it. And that's, you know, what we say since the beginning is they don't give away multiaggers for free. Okay. Was it fun, you know, buying uh Cooper Standard at $5 and change and watching it go to 3.85 before going to 15 before dropping back to 9 before going to 25 before dropping back to 13 and now at, you know, whatever it is. What the hell is it? it's at uh almost $40 and on its way to 80 and beyond. Uh but that's why you're rewarded and that's why most people aren't. You know, they buy things up like, you know, the shiniest objects and then they miss a quarter and the stock's down 40% and they did it on margin and they blow themselves up and uh because they don't know what they owned. Backter, does this look like it's it's it's you're you're buying it frothy? Like if the market corrected 15% next month, my money is that not only would this not correct 15%. This would probably be up 20 to 30% because it's a defensive uh and you can see it did the exact same thing in the early 2000s. It has these cyclical dramatic flushes uncertainty over healthcare and then it works its way back up to new highs and this will be a four bagger. Uh and we've been loading out. Look at, you know, Cooper standard. People like, \"Oh, it's too high.\" Well, deconstruct it and you tell me if if we get to, forget 18 million, which is what we hit every cycle for the last 45 years. If we get to 17 million shares, the thing earns 10 to12. So, you know, is a 10 times multiple too rich on on on 1012? That's $120 stock. What if it gets to a 20 times multiple like it did back here? 140. Oh, should I invest? You know, the market's frothy. Depends what you're buying. Disney, we've had a huge move in there.

When that happens, these sleepy, boring dividend payers will be in high demand, triggering a rotation that brings defenses back into vogue and will be more than happy to help investors get exposure. Two of the names we believe are well positioned to benefit from this rotation and the focus of this week's article are Hormel and Dagio.\n### FEATURED_COMPANY_DEEP_DIVES\nHormel just reported his fastest topline growth in nearly 3 years plus 6% yearonear. Let me repeat that. Fastest topline growth in nearly 3 years. 6% yearonear as the protein craze continues to show no signs of slowing. Unfortunately, a steep and unexpected rise in commodity costs caught Horell off sides, erasing much of that benefit and putting earnings under pressure. Par for the course this earnings season, the market overreacted, sending shares down 13%, we were in the market buying as many shares as we could. And for those who sold us shares in the whole, we thank you for your service. So you can see here hogs they do you know bacon and all that stuff live cattle horell dinty beef stew uh and feeder cattle has gone parabolic it's now starting to break down when these commodities break like you saw in 2014 and you in live and feeder they don't break down a little they break down abruptly and the trend continues for three years that's when you're going to see the restaurant stocks the horses of the world absolutely go straight up at the End of the day, Hormel has been compounding wealth since 1891, not 2021, 1891. They've been doing this for a while, ladies and gentlemen. To think this is the first time it has faced rising input costs over 130 years is laughable. As it has done many times before, Hormeell will work through a handful of quarters of margin volatility while passing through costs. Zoom out and this will be nothing more than a blip on the radar. On top of that, you have a proven CEO, Jeff Edinger, back at the helm to write the ship through October 2026 with plenty of time to work his magic and position the new CEO to step in as a hero. In the meantime, we'll continue to add shares where we can collect the five 4.5% dividend yield and growing by the way and watch this sleepy name recover. Okay, under Etinger last tenure during 11 years he had an a five bagger in 11 years. He came in when the stock was $7. He left when the stock was $38. Uh I think he's going to have at least a double if not a triple. Uh but probably between now and 2026, probably a double. Uh and then the new CEO will take it from there. In the meantime, you get a growing dividend yield and you get to lock in that dividend yield. And the reason that's important is because they are a dividend aristocrat. So, not only are you locking in that yield, but it keeps growing every single year. And when you can lock in a 4.5% dividend yield on Hormeell, uh, you know, 10 years from now, you're you've got a 10% yield on your basis and you've got a triple stock and a and a a perennial compounder for 130 plus years. So, we've highlighted some of the key points. They've had 59 consecutive years of dividend increases, 97 years of dividend payments without interruption. Their dividend yield grows at a 5% compound annual growth rate. So basically every uh 12 every 14 years the dividend doubles at that pace. So in 14 years you'd be getting a 9% yield on your basis and growing. So call it, you know, 15, 16 years, your dividend will have doubled. The stock will have probably quadrupled. Uh and uh and your income keeps going up every year above the pace of inflation. It's unbelievable. Uh and people are clamoring to buy tea bills. So they took their sales guidance up from 2.1 billion to 2.15 billion mean uh net sales organic net sales growth up 2.3 2 to 3% operating income growth up 5 to 7%. 10 key points organic net sales rose 6% year-on-year to 3.3 3.03 03 billion accelerating for the third straight quarter and sharply above Q2's 1% growth. Growth was driven by volume plus 3% and pricing plus 2% and positive performance across all three segments. Two adjusted operating margins fell 80 basis points yearon-year to 8.4% as steep runup in commodity inflation completely eroded the benefits from the strong runup in topline growth. Beef costs remain near all-time highs. Pork bellies are up 30%, wholesale pork up 10%, driving a 400 basis points increase in raw material cost inflation in Q3 alone. Management is implementing targeted pricing actions and evaluating additional measures with profit recovery expected to lag into next year as cost pressures persist in Q4 and price hikes only partially benefit the the upcoming quarter. However, this is not the first time Hormell has faced high commodity prices in it 130 year operating history. They have a track record of successfully passing on costs in the past and we expect this time will be no different. Number three, the transform and modernize initiative rem remains on track delivering results in line with management expectations of 90 b 90 projects contributing measurable val value and earnings. Management continues to expect incremental benefits for fiscal years 2025 of 100 to 150 million is currently tracking toward the high end of the range. Retail segment delivered 5% volume growth, 5% net sales growth and segments of profit uh and segment profits of negative4%. Topline strength was broad-based with five of six brands posting year-on-year growth. Geno was a standout, up 13% year-on-year, continuing to outpace the broader category and gain market share on top of its number one position. Spam also delivered another quarter year-on-year volume and net sales growth. Segment profitability was pressured by input costs with management expecting profits to begin to recover in 2026 as pricing actions take effect. The food service segment delivered 2% organic volume growth, 7% organic net sales growth, and segment profits down 1% year-on-year. Hormemell outpaced the broader industry despite ongoing pressure, including declining restaurant traffic and soft, higher margin convenience store visits. Premium pepperoni was a standout, posting over 20% volume growth. Management expects the pass through nature of costs in the food service portfolio to drive a faster recovery of profitability, which is key as the segment typically commands mid- teens operating margin versus high single digits at retail. Six, the international segment delivered 8% volume growth, 6% net sales growth, but its segment profitability fell 13% year-on-year. Topline strength was driven by thriving Chinese market and positive export results led by chi global the the global spam brand profitability was primarily impacted by ongoing competitive pressures in Brazil. Seven Planters acquired by Hormel in 2021 for 3.35 billion continues its turnaround achieving higher year-on-year growth in distribution, household penetration, and turning dollar sales positive by quarter end with capacity now in place to meet demand. Management expects continued sales momentum. On the bottom line, profit recovery is lagging expectations, though Q3 profit did grow, albeit more slowly, than topline gains. Eight. Management continues to prioritize the company's dividend aristocrat status, returning $159 million to shareholders this quarter alone through dividend payments, bringing total dividends to $474 million through Q3. This marks 59 consecutive years of dividend increases and the 388th consecutive quarterly dividend with a 5-year dividend growth kagger of 5%. Capex for the quarter totaled 72 million or 2.4% of net sales up from 65 million last year. The largest investments remain focused on expanding capacity and optimizing the manufacturing footprint with management forecasting fullear capex of 300 million. And 10 management revised fullear guidance narrowing net sales to 2.15 billion from 2.1 billion implying 2 to 3% organic net sales growth due to steep commodity cost increases. Adjusted operating income is now expected at 1.05 5 to 1.07 billion with adjusted EPS midpoint reduced to 1.44 from 1.63. Most importantly, management reiterated that long-term algorithm remains intact. 2 to 3% organic net sales\nStill generating 2.7 billion of free cash. Now moving on to Dagio. This is yet another straw hat. Buying straw hats in the winter. That's what we like to do, ladies and gentlemen. We buy straw hats when no one wants them in the wintertime. And then when everyone wants them in the summertime, uh we sell them at double. Shares have been cut in half as if consumers will never drink again. We're more than happy to take the other side of that trade. While consumers may be moderating, the real trend is clear. They are drinking less but drinking better. No company is better positioned to capitalize on this long-term premium immization than Diagio. Dagio is a classic story of cyclical downturns playing out within a long-term secular uptrend and we expect this cycle to be no different. The number one thing we can look for in a turnaround is free cash flow recovering and that is already well underway with management targeting $3 billion of free cash flow for the coming year. In the meantime, as management waits for the inevitable cycle to turn, they continue to focus on what they can control, cutting costs and positioning the company for the next leg of growth. Zoom out a few years and Dagio will be leaner, stronger, and benefiting from margin tailwinds tied to premiumization. It will be growing at a mid singledigit clip and trading above $200 tomorrow. In our opinion, again, you're at hedge fun.com. Uh, scroll to the top, click on terms. This is all opinion, not advice. Consult with your financial advisor, psychic, guru, magic eightball, whatever you need to do before doing anything. Let's go here. Number one thing we look for is free cash flow coming in in the meantime. Ah, okay. Mids singledigit clip trading above 200 tomorrow's newspaper today. Until then, we sit on our hands and collect our 4% dividend and wait. Top 10 uh points. Number one, organic net sales rose 1.7% ahead of street consensus of 1.4 driven by.9% volume growth and8 price mix growth. Management noted that the tariff driven pull forward behind last quarter's 5.9% year-on-year growth has largely cycled through with inventory levels now normalized. Number two, Diagio gained or maintained share in 65% of total net sales across measured markets including the US and delivered organic growth in four or five regions. Sales rose 1.5% in North America, 9.2% in Latin America and Caribbean. If you remember, that's where they had all the problems when the stock tanked. Uh so that's now recovering.3% in Europe, 10.5% in Africa, while Asia-Pacific declined 3.2% on weaker China and travel retail. I can tell you one thing in Africa where they've got 10.5% growth they're not worried about ompic and they're not worried about uh zero calorie zero alcohol Dagio they're selling the real stuff and they're selling it by the boatload three Guinness remained a standout during the quarter delivering 13% organic net sales growth and gaining share in its top three markets Great Britain Ireland and the US Guinness 0.0 Zero continues to expand, driving 40% growth in Diagio's non-alcoholic portfolio, where the company leads the market at four times the size of its nearest competitor. Don Julio was another highlight, up 38% organically and gaining share in 90% plus of measured markets. Number four, management raised its cost savings target under the Accelerate program to $625 million from $500 million over three years. 50% of the savings are expected to flow through to the bottom line, supporting mids singledigit organic operating profit growth for fiscal year 2026 and sustaining a 29% sectorle leading EBIT margin with the remainder reinvested for growth. Diagio generated 2.75 billion in free cash flow for the year, up 139 million year. Improving cash flow remains a top priority for management with guidance for at least $3 billion annually starting in 2026, which includes a one-time accelerate program cost with upside potential as the business recover at current prices. This implies free cash flow yield of at least 5%. Six, cleaning up the balance sheet remains a top priority with DI Dagio ending the quarter with 21.9 billion in net debt and 3.4 times net leverage ratio in line with prior guidance of 3.3 to 3.5. management retrain remains on track to hit 2.5 to three times net debt to IBID target by fiscal year 2028 at the latest seven% of Dagio's business is unaffected by US tariffs with most products exempt under USMCA management expects a $200 million annualized operating profit hit but aims to mitigate 50% in year one before broader tariff specific pricing actions Eight management expects capex of 1.2 to 1.3 billion for the coming year, down from 1.5 in fiscal year 2025 as they continue to focus on improving return on invested capital and higher growth opportunities over the next three years. Capex is projected to decline to a mid singledigit percent of next sales versus 7.7 in fiscal year 20259. Diagio has a track record of active portfolio management and remains committed to pursuing disposals of non-core assets. However, despite earlier rumors, management has no plans to sell Guinness or its stake in Moet Hennessy at this time 10 for fiscal year 2026. Management expects organic net se sales growth near fiscal 2025 levels uh ne negative one uh which is 1.7% with slowly slightly negative first half and accelerating second half which would imply organic sales growth in the 4% range. They anticipate a return to positive operating leverage as cost savings kick in driving mids singledigit organic profit growth which includes the current impact of tariffs. So that's the story there. Can read all the key highlights from the earnings call. Fear and greed is at neutral levels. National Association of Active Investment Managers a little fear in there. Healthcare top 30 weights revised down 2.44%. That's why people are so bearish on it. The biggest downward revisions have been the insurers like Elevance, Sigma, UNH, and then a few drug companies. But for the most part, on a company by company basis, most of them have been revised up. PPI, as we discussed, was expected to come in at 3.3%, came in at 2.6%. That's a preview of coming attractions. They might be late with these cuts, but if they if they get caught up quickly, it'll be fine. You can see earnings are now back over not only at 300, but remember they got down to like 293 for next year. They're now at 303. Uh,\n\n### MACRO_DATA_SLIDES\ndefensives uh staples, energy, healthcare, and utilities um relative to the the tech. And you can see the inverse relationship at an inflection point. Now, uh cyclical versus defensive flows since the October uh since the April 8th low. And high y high dividend yield still cheap and underowned, the cheapest since 2001. We've covered this. It's starting to this is going to be a core theme for the next 24 months. You're going to see it happening. Dividend yield is neglected by active managers. A key driver of this view is the fact that dividend yield remains cheap and neglected, a trend we've we expect to reverse quickly as the Fed enters this easing cycle once rate cuts begin.

Uh,\n\n### FEATURED_COMPANY_DEEP_DIVES\nI'm aware of your position in China's equity on Chinese equities uh xbaba, but please hear me out. Outrage bull market in China. DE K be cream of the crop. Uh look man, you want to dance with the devil, you might win, but just know you can do all the work in the world and wind up with an empty bag. Obvious this looks beautifully beautiful technically. Um, it's probably going to rise. I mean, look, if you want to play with fire, just get out before the building is on fire. But, um, financially, I'm sure this is going to look incredible. But, it's not a national champion like Alibaba. So, if if BK or BEK blew up tomorrow, no one would give a And um, and that that concerns me. So if Baba was destroyed tomorrow, so would Xiinping be destroyed tomorrow and he would be out of office. So uh I'm not taking company and country risk. And you know, look, we're in a bull market, so everyone's going to get excited about all these names and they're going to make money in them for a while because it's early stage of the bull market. I'm not going to be one of them. I got all my eggs in a basket with a lot of outs that's made me a unbelievable amount of money now. and uh on the options like insane amounts of money and uh cuz we've done it we've had like multiple bites of the apple at that over the last couple of years and uh and now it's going to make me an insane amount of money also on the stock and that's going to take you know we're just excited. Okay. Um revenues look good. Share count got a little out of control. They got they reigned it back in. It's not It's not generating a good return on capital for owners. So, I don't like that. Let's take a look at the balance sheet. I'm sure it's fine. 7 billion of cash. Basically, zero debt, generates a billion dollars of cash. Yeah. Look, again, I mean, yes, but it's China and and and people are going to forget that this cycle. and there's going to be a lot of new paper issued and uh people are going to get burned, but that's three years from now. So, if you want to, you know, when the music's playing, you got to get up and dance. You can probably get away with this one for a couple years and double or triple your money. But um the hell do they do here? Housing transactions and services. So, housing coming back. It's probably early for that bet, but look, I think you're fine, Goran, but I'm not taking that gamble with you, even though I think it'll probably work for you. Um, rule number one for Look, here's here's the bottom line, Goran. If JP Morgan were going to finance you to buy the entire business, they were going to give you debt financing to buy 100% of BEK with the only caveat is you had to put 100% of your net worth as the equity slug. So if it worked, you would make not double or triple your money, but 10 or 20x your money. But if it didn't work, JP Morgan gets the business, you get wiped out, hole in the donut, you go become a greeter at Walmart, would you do the deal? And if the answer is yes, and you've done enough work that you would risk everything on it because you think you're going to make 20x, then you should buy one share. If you don't feel that way, and you're just like, China's going up, so where can I gamble and hope that it goes up with China? Uh, have at it. But, you know, eventually you're going to get taken out on a stretcher. Maybe not from BK. It'll be the next one. And BK, you'll 10x your money and you'll say, \"I'm so brilliant because, you know, I saw China was going up and I bought a leverage play and I gambled and won.\" And then you're going to say, \"Because I'm so brilliant, I'm going to gamble and win again.\" But you're not going to call it gambling. You're going to say, \"I'm a sophisticated investor.\" That's old school. They make doubles and triples. I'm new school. I make eight baggers. and you're going to put the whole damn thing in and you're going to get wiped and I'm going to be waving to you. Not when I walk into Walmart, when I drive by Walmart, cuz I don't walk into Walmart. So, that's all I have to tell you. Uh, your analysis is fine, but it's China and it's you got to understand it's a different game and you haven't been long enough to realize um that. So, dance while the music stops, but you better be damn right when the music is ending. It's not yet. It's not near, but it's coming uh in a matter of years. And it'll probably be the last time they turn on the music for a long time in China, by the way. This is the last cycle.\nInspire turnaround in healthcare. This looks pretty interesting.

[Music] Okay, so this is a tiny company that's gone from losing money. Oh, sorry. This is the cash flow statement. Let's see what it's doing on cash flow. All right. Yeah, it's gone from burning cash to now huge inflection. Revenues are growing. Shares outstanding are growing, but not not insanely. Um, on face value, I like this a lot. Paul 445 no debt. Okay. So what do they do? Medical technology company development and commercialization of minimally invasive solutions for patients with obstructive sleep apnea. Uh provides safe treatment for moderate and severe nerve st maintain open airway. Yeah. So, I think the name of the game is, you know, what's their moat? How do they maintain their moat? What's their competition? Looks like things are going in the right direction, but you're making you're making a binary bet here. Uh, and you're kind of having to predict the future, which I don't love, but I think you probably have a decent enough margin of safety. It's worth doing more research, but you really better understand everything about the competition and the moat and talk to doctors, do channel checks, uh, find out why there's nothing else like this because, you know, this thing is in the early stages of breakdown even though the fundamentals are improving. kind of reminds me of Amazon in 2000 to 2002 when the fundamentals were improving but it was a broken growth stock and the stock fell 90% before you know it went on to do all the great things that it did. Um I think this one I'd probably explore again in the 60s or 50s. May never get it but in the meantime do your work be patient and wait for for an opportunity. I just think it's I still think it's a little early even though it's down 70 something 75%. 90% I'd be more interested. Um but good one. Good one.

    "ASK_ME_ANYTHING_QA": "\n\n What if it gets to a 20 times multiple like it did back here? 140. Oh, should I invest? You know, the market's frothy. Depends what you're buying. ### FEATURED_COMPANY_DEEP_DIVES Disney, we've had a huge move in there. We bought a ton at 85, so it's 120, 117. This thing hasn't even started. This is going to work its way to new highs. Streaming is profitable. They got a moat around their businesses, the parks, the cruises, the whole thing. Generrack has had it double over the last couple of months. This is just beginning its cycle. This is going to go work its way back 200, 300, and beyond. and maybe back to new highs with what's happening with the um uh data center business that we covered in in recent weeks. Intel, we've got gone through this. Do you think you're overpaying here? I mean, this is early days. We're going to talk a little bit about that this week. government's going to force force people to take stuff implicit coercion to take Intel's 14A stuff and sign up for big orders and you are going to see this thing back over 60 back over a 100red and beyond as this thing works out over time small caps. Okay, now people are getting interested that it's just breaking out to all-time highs after this, you know, cup and handle for all the technicians. Measured move implies another $90. So that would be 243. Uh so 34 330 minimum and and this is just early days for small caps. We've been talking about it. All you got skeptical on me here when we were just buying everything under the sun and now here we are breaking out to new highs. Same with regional banks. Everyone was chasing the megas. The regionals are just breaking out. You're going to see a huge amount of consolidation. PayPal. This thing is generating more cash than they know what to do with. This one is going to be another Alibaba where you're you get patient. You know, here we Let's just pull it up again for the 87th time. You know what? We're going to skip commodities today. We'll do them next week because we got too many ### ASK_ME_ANYTHING_QA\n\nquestions . But I want you to look at this. We went over it a million times with Alibaba and I said, \"Hang in there, ladies and gentlemen. Hang in there, ladies and gentlemen.\" Well, let me tell you where we are with Alibaba. Okay, we just broke through here. We just got out of denial. Now we are starting the parabolic move all the way back up to new highs with returning confidence. I'll show you the chart once again so you can see this. Okay, you had aversion. This is denial and now we are into moving up here. Remember this. Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom. We are in the parabolic move stage. This is going to go well over $200 and everyone's going to start getting excited once there's a two handle on it. And we've already made we'll have by that time made six and a half, 7x on our options. we'll be up 3x on our stock and um you know not not a bad day for the largest position by far in the portfolio although Cooper Standard has moved so much that that's a huge position uh not because of that's what where it started but you know with uh four five six seven and a halfx that that kind of stuff happens. So um so where are we with PayPal? Okay, everyone's super skeptical. Alex Chris is doing everything he said he was going to do and then some. But people can't wait. So here you are. You had your break big breakdown. This is exactly where we are, ladies and gentlemen. Ready? We are in right here. Aversion. Okay, we shot up to 90 anxiety back to aversion. We're going to get to denial pretty quickly like we just got through with Baba. And then we're going to get to return confidence when we have the parabolic move. So new money comes in today. I'd be buying the out of PayPal. I'd be buying it till my fingers bled while everyone's saying, \"Is the market too high? Should I sell my indexes? Should I sell my mag seven?\" I don't know. I'm not your money manager. You go go talk to uh uh you know, someone else. Okay? We do serious underwriting here. Private equity in the public markets. If we wouldn't buy 100% of the company with 100% of our net worth, we won't buy one share. PayPal. There's nothing to think about with free cash flow. Stanley Black & Decker. Okay. Oh, it's had this, you know, 60% move off the lows. Okay. So, what? Did the exact same thing in the early 2000s. Big fake out we had uh in April. Now, we're just getting started. We're going to work back up to new highs over the next couple years. Housing rates lower, the whole game. We've been talking about this. It's happening in real time, but it's early days. And um it's like people are like, \"Well, how do you put new money to work?\" There's nothing to think. I mean, I could still buy VFC Corp at $16. Are you kidding me? Like, how many shares can I possibly get my hands on? I got Brack and Daryl. This is going to be a four bagger plus on the stock. Probably another five bagger on the options. I mean, actually, it's going to be more than a five bagger on the options. It's going to be eight or nine bagger on the options because we were able to buy so many in the in the twelves and the spreads that we did. Yeah. Anyway, it it's I I just love this business. I mean, I absolutely I mean, if I loved golf as much as I loved doing this business, I'd be a scratch already. I got down to a 93, by the way. I hit my low index earlier in this week and then the next day I went out and shot a 95 because my rib muscles are bothering me again. But we got a hyperbaric chamber. I'm all good. I'm going to go back out and shoot 8283 like I did last weekend. So, um, anyway, mortgage rates, here we go. What have we been saying? By the end of the year, 30-year fix below six. Well, where are we? 628 and we haven't even got the cut yet. What about these option arms? They're now 562. Um, ladies and gentlemen, this is the the game is very close to being on. ETF market share US small caps record lows going back 30 years. This game is just getting started. Uh, hiring well short of expectations. We know the million revisions now. What a complete train wreck. I can't believe that stuff happened. I mean, those people should be hunted down anyway. It's It's sad, but new leadership is coming. We're going to get better numbers. There's always going to be revisions, but that that just was absolutely egregious. Um, can you find the trend? Jobs created, so it continues to go down. Mainland China margin debt levels versus market cap just getting out of the the just getting out of the gate here. Not yet massively elevated. S&P 500 quarterly year-on-year EPS growth relative to consensus expectations 11 versus 4 uh earnings growth expectations for next quarter 7%. Uh so we'll see where it comes in. Probably greater than double digits again. By the way, biotech just getting started here. I mean this is exciting. This has been consolidating for two years. This looks like it's just $5 away from denial. Once we get up to 100 105, we're right here, denial. And then we get our parabolic move and people say, \"What happened?\" And all of a sudden, everyone that bailed out down\n\n### HEADLINES_AND_NEWS\n\n### TECHNICAL_CHARTS\n\n### ASK_ME_ANYTHING_QA\n\n### HEADLINES_AND_NEWS\n\n### TECHNICAL_CHARTS\n\n### ASK_ME_ANYTHING_QA\n\n### ASK_ME_ANYTHING_QA\nwith that said , we're going to move on to the ask me anything\n\n### ASK_ME_ANYTHING_QA\nquestions\n\n### ASK_ME_ANYTHING_QA\n\n### FEATURED_COMPANY_DEEP_DIVES\nI'm aware of your position in China's equity on Chinese equities uh xbaba, but please hear me out. Outrage bull market in China. DE K be cream of the crop. Uh look man, you want to dance with the devil, you might win, but just know you can do all the work in the world and wind up with an empty bag. Obvious this looks beautifully beautiful technically. Um, it's probably going to rise. I mean, look, if you want to play with fire, just get out before the building is on fire. But, um, financially, I'm sure this is going to look incredible. But, it's not a national champion like Alibaba. So, if if BK or BEK blew up tomorrow, no one would give a And um, and that that concerns me. So if Baba was destroyed tomorrow, so would Xiinping be destroyed tomorrow and he would be out of office. So uh I'm not taking company and country risk. And you know, look, we're in a bull market, so everyone's going to get excited about all these names and they're going to make money in them for a while because it's early stage of the bull market. I'm not going to be one of them. I got all my eggs in a basket with a lot of outs that's made me a unbelievable amount of money now. and uh on the options like insane amounts of money and uh cuz we've done it we've had like multiple bites of the apple at that over the last couple of years and uh and now it's going to make me an insane amount of money also on the stock and that's going to take you know we're just excited. Okay. Um revenues look good. Share count got a little out of control. They got they reigned it back in. It's not It's not generating a good return on capital for owners. So, I don't like that. Let's take a look at the balance sheet. I'm sure it's fine. 7 billion of cash. Basically, zero debt, generates a billion dollars of cash. Yeah. Look, again, I mean, yes, but it's China and and and people are going to forget that this cycle. and there's going to be a lot of new paper issued and uh people are going to get burned, but that's three years from now. So, if you want to, you know, when the music's playing, you got to get up and dance. You can probably get away with this one for a couple years and double or triple your money. But um the hell do they do here? Housing transactions and services. So, housing coming back. It's probably early for that bet, but look, I think you're fine, Goran, but I'm not taking that gamble with you, even though I think it'll probably work for you. Um, rule number one for Look, here's here's the bottom line, Goran. If JP Morgan were going to finance you to buy the entire business, they were going to give you debt financing to buy 100% of BEK with the only caveat is you had to put 100% of your net worth as the equity slug. So if it worked, you would make not double or triple your money, but 10 or 20x your money. But if it didn't work, JP Morgan gets the business, you get wiped out, hole in the donut, you go become a greeter at Walmart, would you do the deal? And if the answer is yes, and you've done enough work that you would risk everything on it because you think you're going to make 20x, then you should buy one share. If you don't feel that way, and you're just like, China's going up, so where can I gamble and hope that it goes up with China? Uh, have at it. But, you know, eventually you're going to get taken out on a stretcher. Maybe not from BK. It'll be the next one. And BK, you'll 10x your money and you'll say, \"I'm so brilliant because, you know, I saw China was going up and I bought a leverage play and I gambled and won.\" And then you're going to say, \"Because I'm so brilliant, I'm going to gamble and win again.\" But you're not going to call it gambling. You're going to say, \"I'm a sophisticated investor.\" That's old school. They make doubles and triples. I'm new school. I make eight baggers. and you're going to put the whole damn thing in and you're going to get wiped and I'm going to be waving to you. Not when I walk into Walmart, when I drive by Walmart, cuz I don't walk into Walmart. So, that's all I have to tell you. Uh, your analysis is fine, but it's China and it's you got to understand it's a different game and you haven't been long enough to realize um that. So, dance while the music stops, but you better be damn right when the music is ending. It's not yet. It's not near, but it's coming uh in a matter of years.

So in the case of uh Starbucks, here's your coffee chart.\n\n### FEATURED_COMPANY_DEEP_DIVES\nwe own Varco. We've talked about Varco. We've covered it in articles. Go back and look. Um, LBRT hydraulic fracking services. I mean, why would you buy this when you could buy Schlumbumberge or Hallebertton or National Oil Well, Varco? You don't need to own six of them. Pick the best and buy it. I would buy if you're going to buy services. As far as value per dollar, I think it's Varco. I don't think it's Liberty Energy.\n### ASK_ME_ANYTHING_QA\nSomeone inquired about Starbucks. Uh are you still buyer? Said you'd be a buyer at $80. Uh let's see. Daryl Lyset. Uh I don't think I said 80. I think I said 60, but I don't think I'm going to get 60. I mean, look, here's a stock that's off 20 30%. I I'm not like that doesn't excite me. I don't think I don't think Starbucks is going to $200 anytime soon. So, if I can't double my money in three years, I'm not going to commit a dollar. Like, if you want, you know, dividend yielder with Brian McNichol, he's a brilliant CEO. You know, you can have $80 go to $130 in three years. That's great. But this is like this is this is a snoozefest for me. Uh great CEO, great company, not enough dislocation. If it got down to like 50 or 60, which it won't. Look, the other thing that's going to happen is commodity prices are coming down for coffee.\n### TECHNICAL_CHARTS\nOkay, so here's coffee. This is the same story as Horell and uh every single restaurant that's getting margins killed by live cattle and feeder cattle. So in the case of uh Starbucks, here's your coffee chart.\n\n### HEADLINES_AND_NEWS\n\n### TECHNICAL_CHARTS\n\n### ASK_ME_ANYTHING_QA\n\n### ASK_ME_ANYTHING_QA\nwe are. We are at near record all-time high coffee prices, which is a margin compression environment for Starbucks. This looks very much like 2011. You get your top, you get your retest, and then you collapse for the next 3 or 4 years. As you collapse for the next 3 or 4 years, you can see what happened to Starbucks from 2011 to 2014. I don't even have to look at the chart to see what happened. And what you're going to find is 2011 to 2014, the stock went from $10 to $50, four baggers. So yeah, I think your timing is right. I just don't think you're going to get the multibags that I need to commit a dollar of capital. But if you want a safe stock that's marked down a few pennies that you can get on a half a sale, then that's fine.\n\nWe've covered this one a few times and I've continued to say no. Um, I think this is, you know, you've got a basically a you got a broken growth stock is what you have. And um, you know, you you have to be damn sure that their moat is impenetrable against the likes of Amazon and Google. Their revenues and free cash flow keep growing. Their margins are compressing a little bit. Um, this one has been a pass for me. I think it's going to continue to be a pass for me. I think it's very hard to understand uh how they maintain the moat. And I'm willing to be completely wrong. This would be an error of omission, not commission. I understand it looks cheap, but uh for me, when these type of things break, they tend to take an awful long time to uh build a new shareholder base. So, I'm going to pass Caesars CZ RP. Uh, interesting. My guess is they have a lot of debt to refinance yet again. Like every cycle with these casinos, revenues have been flat following COVID. Free cash flow is just barely positive. See here, revenues declining a little bit year on year. They doubled the share count in 2020 to 2021. They must have done an a big acquisition. Um yeah, and look what happened to shareholder value. Dropped 80%. free cash flow negative big time last year. Let's see about quarterly. Yeah, start to come back. So, they got 860 million of cash. They have 12 billion dollar of debt. That's a big problem. Yeah. If you're barely free cash flow positive and you got 12 billion dollars of debt that you have to refinance, they might get bailed out by the easing cycle, but that's not an ideal scenario. Let's see what they bought. Maybe they explained it to us here.\n\nMichael Costa, for a stock to look at, curious on your opinion of Lulu. Lulu is like Starbucks and Nike. Great business. Down on its luck. You know, I continue to channel check this stuff. Um, so actually, my assistant helped me understand what's going on in terms of culturally with it. I think Lulu is going to be fine. I just I I I'd never really understood the moat. Well, I did on I look, I get it, but this one's hard because the CEO was a hard charger. It's kind of like when the Under Armour was run by the founder and the thing just took off. He was hungry. Then he started buying vineyards and doing all this with horses and took his eye off the ball. Kind of same as Lulu. Um, the top design person went to Vans. I am so tempted by this one and I'm not going to do anything because I don't want overlapping correlated bets and I've already got VF and that for me is a huge winner. So, um, for that reason, I'm going to pass. But um let's just look at some numbers here. Free cash flow is great. Revenues are still growing. Shares outstanding fine. Good return on capital balance sheet. Great. I don't know. I I think you I I don't think you're going to get really hurt buying this at this level. I don't think you can be certain, but I think it's it's pretty close to the level where you you really want to be a buyer of this. I I would do some channel checks and really understand what's happening because there were some issues about what it does to hormones and like some stupid stuff was said uh uh um cultural mishaps that they did. So, you got to make an assessment whether whether that's temporary or permanent. Uh, in the case of Bud Light, the reverse version of this, it was kind of a permanent impairment, but um, most of the others have been temporary. I think this one is going to be pretty good from these levels, but it's not a pound the table one where I can make multiags. I don't think they're going to be multi-bags. You may get a bag or a bag and a half if everything goes great. Um, and that's why I prefer VFC Corp. Good question. The answer is I think you're right. Edgar Abru, uh, Lulu Louise just covered UPS. I agree and I'm not doing anything with it yet and I'm going to be okay missing it, but I definitely like UPS and I definitely have an eye on it.\n\nMichael Costa, can we look at opportunities and potential market reactions for the September Fed meeting and maybe fall season volatility? Also, maybe even talk about potential hedging strategies if it's needed. No, I think number one any volatility is going to be shortterm and you wind up just wasting 1 to 2% of equity just so you can have a short-term marktomarket benefit. It's a waste of time. Um this year uh it's not always a waste of time but uh in this year I think it is. I think, you know, we've been able to raise millions and millions of capital just with the six, five, six, and soon to be 7x in uh some of our options positions. So, we've got a lot of cash now uh that we're not needing. You know, this is cash we can put to work right away in in certain names tomorrow and we will uh and we'll have some cash. I I don't think you're going to get a lot of people missed April, so they're hoping September. They were hoping September or early October would be that April again because of recency bias. And I think they're going to be wrong. I think the market pushes too much higher. Not not much higher. I I think the market pushes higher into year end is is what I'm trying to say. And it may be masked. Maybe the indices don't do so much better. Uh but I think there going to be a lot of names that do really well. So, if we're, you know, if we're not buying PayPal at $66 because we think or Baxter or some of the others, uh, or Horell because we think that the indices, which is basically MAG 7, might stumble a little bit. I think we're making a huge mistake because if those stumble, the defensives are going to get bid. So um there are things to do right now irrespective of the Fed, irrespective of volatility. Um I don't want to miss buying a PayPal or others that were in the market aggressively on in the last few days because I'm guessing about whether the index might correct 3% or 6% or not at all or just keep moving higher. Um, you know, the reason we took a lot of profits on the options is because we're basically at at or near the max value. If you can get five and a half or 6x now and your max possible value of the spread is 7x and you got to wait 3 months and everything has to happen perfectly for one more turn. You take some off and yeah, we'll get some that'll be 7x, the full 7x, but not all, you know. and uh world's smallest violin. Elliot Simmons. It's asking me about Cholu Mexican Grill. Is there a multiple? I'd like that. I I I don't think I ever look at multiples. I look at free creek cash flow. No, I No, it's No, it's nowhere like at $30. I would take a look. It's never gonna It's very unlikely it gets to $30. I mean, here's a stock that went up 14x in seven years and now it's pulled back a little bit and people want to jump on the train. You can jump on the train. It It's a great business. I'd rather be, if I'm going to be in restaurants, I want bigger upside than a a 50% move because the restaurant business is a tough business and when these type of things break, um, it can take a little while to repair and it might be indicative of other things going on. But long-term, I would 100% bet on Chipotle and Scott Boatight. And I know all a lot of these people live here. Uh, great business, great company, great leadership. Uh, for me, I need to see massive dislocation in price for me to allocate a dollar. And this is a pullback. And and for me, I don't get enough bags by buying at this level. and and for this quality of a business, I'm probably never going to get an opportunity to buy when there's massive dislocations. So, for me, it's a pass. Uh but I generally think the business is great and it's going to continue to grow. Um here's another uh investor inquiry. I will get back to you. Thank you so much. Uh Elliot, another one. Yeah. Again, uh Scott Boatright is great. The company's great. Everything's great.\n Marco Staltari. All right. So, this guy wants to play robots through a plastic company or something. Let's take a look. I don't know what this is. I I I don't even have a ticker. If is this is like China. Send me a ticker because it's not coming up anywhere. So, um Kagra Brands. This is similar story to um Hormell. This this one hasn't come down enough for me to get interested. So, I'm going to pass. I need multi bags otherwise like I'm not I'm not interested in 50% in three years. That that doesn't move the needle. Nikolai Johnson Tech again. No, we're not going to get involved in that one. I'm sure it's fine. There's no way to really understand the moat there, but it's probably good. All right. So, here's TJ Vandermir. Uh, thanks for the podcast. Great value sharing in Europe. Thank you for that. Couple years been investing great results. Uh Baba Cooper Standard. What would you do? I' You You know what to do. Own great businesses and sit on your hands. You You already listed all the names. I mean, yeah, tune in, buy them, sit on your hands. That's what you do. Um check with your consultant first. thoughts on Tim asking about constellation again. We covered that. Jimmy Jones target getting close to consideration. Yes. Am I going to do anything about it? Probably not, but maybe. Uh, new CEO is fine. Brendan Garvey. Okay. So, this guy's saying, \"I'm in college. My uh professor is a big um poster boy for passive investing. Efficient market theory is written on his forehead. Uh D. What's something you'd say to this professor to throw him off his skates and prove that outperforming is doing? Just show them your results. I mean, if you're following what we're doing, you should be up at least three times the index and just show them your statements. That's all you need to do. But you're not going to convince someone like that. They're, you know, that their whole livelihood depends on espousing that and brainwashing you that that's the only way to go. And statistically, he's right because there's only going to be a very few number of people that can do what we do here. and uh that's why you tune in every week. So uh if he thinks the majority underperform, he's absolutely correct and he's part of the majority and he'll continue to underperform or buy an index and perform in line or buy a closet indexer and perform in line minus fees. But that's not what we do here. We do private equity in public markets. We underwrite the whole business as if we were buying the whole thing. Uh and we don't buy shares for the sake of buying shares because of some headline or some trend or some flavor of the month. Uh, Scott's Miracle Grow. Yeah, like it. By the way, don't send in more than one question a week. It's kind of selfish for other people. Uh, Lachland Neo, love your podcast. Well done on the amazing results. Thoughts on Porsche? No, we don't buy waring factions, we buy arms dealers. Lee Foster, how do you feel about Buffett's comments on the Craft Hinds de merger? Look, they screwed up. I mean, he got seduced by 5G's zerocost and uh it didn't work. So now they're going to they're in desperation. They got to do something. The brands, you know, look, they've spent 10 years working day and night to destroy two great brands. They couldn't do it. So now they're going to split them up. They're going to get two CEOs that are going to work full-time trying to destroy the brands. but they won't be able to do it because the brands are so good. So the answer to your question is buff it out. We'll remove the overhang on the stock. Hines will be fine. Craft will be fine. Oscar Meyer will be fine. They'll figure it out. And um and we'll look at it when it's separated. But uh all in I think that's going to be okay. Tom Bar for terra healthcare exposure picks and shovels ft egative free cash flow. I'm going to pass next Uh, John Reio asking about pool corp. I think you're I think you'll be okay with this one. I've looked at it. I don't think I'm going to do anything with it, but um yeah, you just want to make sure this trend is actually reversing. And so far, it's not showing signs of it yet, but on balance, this is a long-term compounder. Let's take a look at the balance sheet first. 79 million. Well, this is your problem. You got 79 million of cash. What are the receivables? 314. Okay, so they can borrow against that. I guess 900 million in debt. They've paid down some revenues are still not recovering. Let's see. Quarterly, okay, they're up year on year. That's good. She's outstanding. Okay. Um, I think you're generally okay here. I don't think there's a quick double in it, John, but I think you're generally okay. Pool Corp. Keep it on the watch list. Good job. Uh Jason Resi Honeywell spin-off. Oh, wrangled up a few last minute votes for your future Olympian. Thank you very much. By the way, if you want to This thing is like the neverending contest. She's in the quarterfinals now. If you want to vote for Annabelle each week, I think they email you. Just do the free votes. I know they have this thing where they you can pay for votes. Don't do that. Um, you'll see that once we post this video cast, we'll put the link here. If you want to vote for Annabelle Hayes for Youth Athlete of the Year, please submit your vote there. Every free vote here. Every single vote matters. We are very grateful. We know a lot of you have been getting the emails and voting every single week and we are grateful for that. She is working hard and going to have an incredible season. So, let's take a look at resi. Rezi, this thing is already breaking out. Uh, Jason, hey Jason, why weren't you bringing this to me when no one wanted it at 15? Um, you've been around for a while. You should know that. Um, yeah. Nothing not to really love here. Revenue is growing. Free cash flow is growing. Balance sheet I'm sure is fine, but I don't buy up. So, enjoy. I will not be jumping on this bandwagon, but I'm It looks like you have a pretty decent business here. Uh, but I would not be a buyer up. Next, Eric F again. Lulu, it's fine. It's just I'm not going to get a quick double. What level would you be a buyer of? Cat. It's not going to get to a level that I'd be a buyer. I'd probably be a buyer around 150 or 140 and it's not getting there anytime soon. So, I don't buy things that are way up couple standard deviations above the long-term mean. Don't do it. I sell at these levels. Gasper Mohoric, thanks for the amazing content. Uh, Western Union, I get asked every week. I'm not interested. Agri reality is a lowquality re I think gre someone is pushing the out of Western Union on social media or something. I get this question every week. Agri, I have no interest at these levels. Western Union, I know they're doing a turnaround and everyone's excited. I I I'm not interested in this stock at all. Um that's a trade. If you want to take it for the trade, you probably make a few bucks. Uh, LRN, Stride, Inc. Okay. So, you're giving me a stock that's up uh 25x. No, thank you. Welcome to the podcast, Wesley. Hang around. You're going to learn a lot. That is the antithesis of what we do here. Uh insights on American Axle, it's a it's a completely different business. Uh [Music] I mean, this has just been in secular decline. They didn't even make money when the cycle like they didn't even have a huge run when the cycle was hot. I This is not This is not one we want to be involved in. Um, Phipe Pinkos, that doesn't mean it's not going to bounce with the cycle, but it's just Cooper is a better deal. Uh, FMC, that's from Phipe Andrew Pinkos, who has been a longtime supporter. FMC. Yeah, I like FMC. Let's take a look here. This is a a play and chemicals trying to turn the corner. Not doing it yet, but when these turn, they turn really aggressively in this sector. You know the the issue is everyone's looking for a cookie cutter and the only cookie cutter is 20 or 25 years of experience and understanding what are the exceptions in each sector, each company and the only way you can get that is through a lot of experience. Um 3 billion of debt, 350 million, but they got 3 billion of receivables. Revenues are down a lot, but all everyone in this sector is sharing. Okay, it's 600 million of free cash for last year. Quarterly looks okay. What? Wait, what the hell? Sorry. Quarterly looks really good, actually. Yeah, I think this one's going to be fine. I actually really like it here.

And statistically, he's right because there's only going to be a very few number of people that can do what we do here. and uh that's why you tune in every week. So uh if he thinks the majority underperform, he's absolutely correct and he's part of the majority and he'll continue to underperform or buy an index and perform in line or buy a closet indexer and perform in line minus fees. But that's not what we do here. We do private equity in public markets. We underwrite the whole business as if we were buying the whole thing. Uh and we don't buy shares for the sake of buying shares because of some headline or some trend or some flavor of the month. Uh, Scott's Miracle Grow. Yeah, like it. By the way, don't send in more than one question a week. It's kind of selfish for other people. Uh, Lachland Neo, love your podcast. Well done on the amazing results. Thoughts on Porsche? No, we don't buy waring factions, we buy arms dealers. Lee Foster, how do you feel about Buffett's comments on the Craft Hinds de merger? Look, they screwed up. I mean, he got seduced by 5G's zerocost and uh it didn't work. So now they're going to they're in desperation. They got to do something. The brands, you know, look, they've spent 10 years working day and night to destroy two great brands. They couldn't do it. So now they're going to split them up. They're going to get two CEOs that are going to work full-time trying to destroy the brands. but they won't be able to do it because the brands are so good. So the answer to your question is buff it out. We'll remove the overhang on the stock. Hines will be fine. Craft will be fine. Oscar Meyer will be fine. They'll figure it out. And um and we'll look at it when it's separated. But uh all in I think that's going to be okay. Tom Bar for terra healthcare exposure picks and shovels ft egative free cash flow. I'm going to pass next Uh, John Reio asking about pool corp. I think you're I think you'll be okay with this one. I've looked at it. I don't think I'm going to do anything with it, but um yeah, you just want to make sure this trend is actually reversing. And so far, it's not showing signs of it yet, but on balance, this is a long-term compounder. Let's take a look at the balance sheet first. 79 million. Well, this is your problem. You got 79 million of cash. What are the receivables? 314. Okay, so they can borrow against that. I guess 900 million in debt. They've paid down some revenues are still not recovering. Let's see.

I don't think there's a quick double in it, John, but I think you're generally okay. Pool Corp. Keep it on the watch list. Good job. Uh Jason Resi Honeywell spin-off.

Revenue is growing. Free cash flow is growing. Balance sheet I'm sure is fine, but I don't buy up. So, enjoy.

Transports breaking out.\n### FEATURED_COMPANY_DEEP_DIVES\nSpeaking of transport, I keep looking at UPS. We haven't done anything yet, but uh that's interesting. Target, uh, UPS, looking at Starbucks because coffee prices are going to come down and their margins are going to go up just like Hormeell, the the meat prices are going to come down and their margins are going to go back up.

These are going to get bid. uh when when you see a little volatility in the market, which you will. We're positioned for it. We love it. margins continue to improve back up to 11.3 from a 7% trough in 2021. Uh four-year cycle, these are the air years that uh we we tend to do extremely well when there's a lot of turmoil, whether it was buying lows in uh tech in October 2022 and March of 2023 or COVID or this year in April. Um, so the third year of the presidential cycle tends to have volatility. That's where we just absolutely crush it. So, we're excited to get into that period. Uh, dollar stores have outperformed Nvidia in 2025, by the way. You know, that was those were names we were talking about um when they were really beaten down in April. Fallen job openings. So, yeah, they got to get on with the cuts. Hopefully a 50, but more likely a 25. Uh Nixon analog. What's this about? Oh, this is Hartnet being bearish. Value and small caps outperformed in the 1970s. Okay, so he's using this as an analog uh talking about the easing and then what happened with value, small caps, REITs, commodities, real estate. I do think this is a good analog. This is also a similar analog that we saw from 2001 to 2006. Uh and in this period actually uh tech started to underperform. So I do think there's something to be said there.\n\n### MACRO_DATA_SLIDES\nUS equity inflows still dominating year to date. China big move. So China has got the most performance 3 to one over the US and they have the least inflows. It's like the money is just going to be cascading there. Once you get the Xi handshake, if you think the move to 155 was exciting, wait till you see what happens after this. Uh market typically rises when Fed resumes cutting alongside a growing economy. We agree. Uh Athletic Apparel stocks, Lulu, Nike, VF Corp. They've all been weak. These are going to absolutely rip higher. The reason we don't own Nike and not taking a serious look at Lulu is because we have VFC Corp. The reason we have VF Corp is a huge bet on Bracken who had the 28 bagger at the Logitech turnaround is doing an incredible job doing everything he says and he had a lot more outs. He had the Supreme which helped deliver the balance sheet. He's got five other brands a lot of things he can buy and sell in this environment and he will uh and we don't want to be correlated going back to the Bruce Cner quote. So overcorrelated we we've got our exposure in that group. Um keep looking at Dow haven't done anything yet. keep looking at Centine. They just have too much of that Medicaid expo exposure, but it's interesting at these levels because it's pricing that it's like going out of business and it's not. Um seasonality of September, you tend to get a bump early, a little volatility at the end before the year- end rally. Um this shows September versus the rate cut. Contrary to consensus, we think September is going to be an up month. And that's because the Fed been on hold all year and is going to cut for the first time in September. That's only happened twice in the last 50 years. And markets did well both times. Uh so you see the cut starts. This would probably be the better analog, which was 2024, the cut starts, and you get follow through. Car dealership guy, automaker, winners and losers in August. You see a lot of these guys. Toyota up 14%. Honda, Ford is up. SUVs, crossovers, and hybrids continue to carry the market. Household leverage is at a 50-year low. This is unbelievable.

We are going to make so much money. It's going to be insane. Um if by the way most of you are already smiling. So why do you eat four bananas sideways this year? I mean, borrow my glasses. What's going to take place in the next five years is going to be unreal. And um okay, Fed cut equals expansion. That's fun. Here's what the period we're in right now. Kind of bouncing up to the high end of the range, get a little bit of consolidation, year-end rally. That's normal this time of year. So, next couple of weeks, we'll be talking about that consolidation. Those of you who have new money in, we'll be able to take advantage of that. Um, Russell 2000 small cap flows just beginning. You can see here as it's breaking out to new highs. Mainland cap cap China capital inflows into Hong Kong stocks have reached 1 trillion Hong Kong dollars so far this year. Divide that by 850 billion. That's exciting. Speculators are net short across US stock futures. Um, yeah, that's unreal. I mean, that's that's why it's hard to say we're gonna like see any meaningful pullback in September and October beyond, you know, a normal garden variety 5 to 8% which I don't even think uh you'll get as much as that because people are just so skeptical and they so missed so much. So, they're going to just they're going to have to buy the unmagnificent 493 to just they're going to have to buy every single weakness into year end. uh elevated pipeline of deals with issuance. Uh buy performance and buyback aristocrats versus equal weight gross and net buybacks. We have this Russell 2000 just getting ready to break out again. And when they break out, it's it's it's usually multiple multiple years, not weeks or months. Large stocks haven't always dominated the markets. Um, you can see the cycles we've done this international versus US. Small, you can see here the biggest rally in the shortest amount of time from 2000 to 2006. This is where we are, ladies and gentlemen. In my view, you see it in the 70s. You also see it in the early 90s. Uh, which is midcycle, which we've been saying we're probably midcycle another 9 years or so till 2032, 2034. uh until the millennials age up to um early to mid-40s and their spending slows down.

We have long argued that the Fed has been over a 100 basis points too restrictive and the data continues to confirm that view.

The only question is whether it will be 25 or 50 basis points. And as we enter this easing cycle, investors are already tripping over themselves to add exposure exactly where you'd expect.

And you can see the inverse relationship at an inflection point. Now, uh cyclical versus defensive flows since the October uh since the April 8th low. And high y high dividend yield still cheap and underowned, the cheapest since 2001. We've covered this. It's starting to this is going to be a core theme for the next 24 months. You're going to see it happening. Dividend yield is neglected by active managers. A key driver of this view is the fact that dividend yield remains cheap and neglected, a trend we've we expect to reverse quickly as the Fed enters this easing cycle once rate cuts begin. The 7.4 trillion sitting on the sidelines earning 4% risk-f free will be forced to find yield elsewhere. When that happens, these sleepy, boring dividend payers will be in high demand, triggering a rotation that brings defenses back into vogue and will be more than happy to help investors get exposure. Two of the names we believe are well positioned to benefit from this rotation and the focus of this week's article are Hormel and Dagio.\n### FEATURED_COMPANY_DEEP_DIVES\nHormel just reported his fastest topline growth in nearly 3 years plus 6% yearonear. Let me repeat that. Fastest topline growth in nearly 3 years. 6% yearonear as the protein craze continues to show no signs of slowing. Unfortunately, a steep and unexpected rise in commodity costs caught Horell off sides, erasing much of that benefit and putting earnings under pressure. Par for the course this earnings season, the market overreacted, sending shares down 13%, we were in the market buying as many shares as we could. And for those who sold us shares in the whole, we thank you for your service. So you can see here hogs they do you know bacon and all that stuff live cattle horell dinty beef stew uh and feeder cattle has gone parabolic it's now starting to break down when these commodities break like you saw in 2014 and you in live and feeder they don't break down a little they break down abruptly and the trend continues for three years that's when you're going to see the restaurant stocks the horses of the world absolutely go straight up at the End of the day, Hormel has been compounding wealth since 1891, not 2021, 1891. They've been doing this for a while, ladies and gentlemen. To think this is the first time it has faced rising input costs over 130 years is laughable. As it has done many times before, Hormeell will work through a handful of quarters of margin volatility while passing through costs. Zoom out and this will be nothing more than a blip on the radar. On top of that, you have a proven CEO, Jeff Edinger, back at the helm to write the ship through October 2026 with plenty of time to work his magic and position the new CEO to step in as a hero. In the meantime, we'll continue to add shares where we can collect the five 4.5% dividend yield and growing by the way and watch this sleepy name recover. Okay, under Etinger last tenure during 11 years he had an a five bagger in 11 years. He came in when the stock was $7. He left when the stock was $38. Uh I think he's going to have at least a double if not a triple. Uh but probably between now and 2026, probably a double. Uh and then the new CEO will take it from there. In the meantime, you get a growing dividend yield and you get to lock in that dividend yield. And the reason that's important is because they are a dividend aristocrat. So, not only are you locking in that yield, but it keeps growing every single year. And when you can lock in a 4.5% dividend yield on Hormeell, uh, you know, 10 years from now, you're you've got a 10% yield on your basis and you've got a triple stock and a and a a perennial compounder for 130 plus years. So, we've highlighted some of the key points. They've had 59 consecutive years of dividend increases, 97 years of dividend payments without interruption. Their dividend yield grows at a 5% compound annual growth rate. So basically every uh 12 every 14 years the dividend doubles at that pace. So in 14 years you'd be getting a 9% yield on your basis and growing. So call it, you know, 15, 16 years, your dividend will have doubled. The stock will have probably quadrupled. Uh and uh and your income keeps going up every year above the pace of inflation. It's unbelievable. Uh and people are clamoring to buy tea bills. So they took their sales guidance up from 2.1 billion to 2.15 billion mean uh net sales organic net sales growth up 2.3 2 to 3% operating income growth up 5 to 7%. 10 key points organic net sales rose 6% year-on-year to 3.3 3.03 03 billion accelerating for the third straight quarter and sharply above Q2's 1% growth. Growth was driven by volume plus 3% and pricing plus 2% and positive performance across all three segments. Two adjusted operating margins fell 80 basis points yearon-year to 8.4% as steep runup in commodity inflation completely eroded the benefits from the strong runup in topline growth. Beef costs remain near all-time highs. Pork bellies are up 30%, wholesale pork up 10%, driving a 400 basis points increase in raw material cost inflation in Q3 alone. Management is implementing targeted pricing actions and evaluating additional measures with profit recovery expected to lag into next year as cost pressures persist in Q4 and price hikes only partially benefit the the upcoming quarter. However, this is not the first time Hormell has faced high commodity prices in it 130 year operating history. They have a track record of successfully passing on costs in the past and we expect this time will be no different. Number three, the transform and modernize initiative rem remains on track delivering results in line with management expectations of 90 b 90 projects contributing measurable val value and earnings. Management continues to expect incremental benefits for fiscal years 2025 of 100 to 150 million is currently tracking toward the high end of the range. Retail segment delivered 5% volume growth, 5% net sales growth and segments of profit uh and segment profits of negative4%. Topline strength was broad-based with five of six brands posting year-on-year growth. Geno was a standout, up 13% year-on-year, continuing to outpace the broader category and gain market share on top of its number one position. Spam also delivered another quarter year-on-year volume and net sales growth. Segment profitability was pressured by input costs with management expecting profits to begin to recover in 2026 as pricing actions take effect. The food service segment delivered 2% organic volume growth, 7% organic net sales growth, and segment profits down 1% year-on-year. Hormemell outpaced the broader industry despite ongoing pressure, including declining restaurant traffic and soft, higher margin convenience store visits. Premium pepperoni was a standout, posting over 20% volume growth. Management expects the pass through nature of costs in the food service portfolio to drive a faster recovery of profitability, which is key as the segment typically commands mid- teens operating margin versus high single digits at retail. Six, the international segment delivered 8% volume growth, 6% net sales growth, but its segment profitability fell 13% year-on-year. Topline strength was driven by thriving Chinese market and positive export results led by chi global the the global spam brand profitability was primarily impacted by ongoing competitive pressures in Brazil. Seven Planters acquired by Hormel in 2021 for 3.35 billion continues its turnaround achieving higher year-on-year growth in distribution, household penetration, and turning dollar sales positive by quarter end with capacity now in place to meet demand. Management expects continued sales momentum. On the bottom line, profit recovery is lagging expectations, though Q3 profit did grow, albeit more slowly, than topline gains. Eight. Management continues to prioritize the company's dividend aristocrat status, returning $159 million to shareholders this quarter alone through dividend payments, bringing total dividends to $474 million through Q3. This marks 59 consecutive years of dividend increases and the 388th consecutive quarterly dividend with a 5-year dividend growth kagger of 5%. Capex for the quarter totaled 72 million or 2.4% of net sales up from 65 million last year. The largest investments remain focused on expanding capacity and optimizing the manufacturing footprint with management forecasting fullear capex of 300 million. And 10 management revised fullear guidance narrowing net sales to 2.15 billion from 2.1 billion implying 2 to 3% organic net sales growth due to steep commodity cost increases. Adjusted operating income is now expected at 1.05 5 to 1.07 billion with adjusted EPS midpoint reduced to 1.44 from 1.63. Most importantly, management reiterated that long-term algorithm remains intact. 2 to 3% organic net sales\nStill generating 2.7 billion of free cash. Now moving on to Dagio. This is yet another straw hat. Buying straw hats in the winter. That's what we like to do, ladies and gentlemen. We buy straw hats when no one wants them in the wintertime. And then when everyone wants them in the summertime, uh we sell them at double. Shares have been cut in half as if consumers will never drink again. We're more than happy to take the other side of that trade. While consumers may be moderating, the real trend is clear. They are drinking less but drinking better. No company is better positioned to capitalize on this long-term premium immization than Diagio. Dagio is a classic story of cyclical downturns playing out within a long-term secular uptrend and we expect this cycle to be no different. The number one thing we can look for in a turnaround is free cash flow recovering and that is already well underway with management targeting $3 billion of free cash flow for the coming year. In the meantime, as management waits for the inevitable cycle to turn, they continue to focus on what they can control, cutting costs and positioning the company for the next leg of growth. Zoom out a few years and Dagio will be leaner, stronger, and benefiting from margin tailwinds tied to premiumization. It will be growing at a mid singledigit clip and trading above $200 tomorrow. In our opinion, again, you're at hedge fun.com. Uh, scroll to the top, click on terms. This is all opinion, not advice. Consult with your financial advisor, psychic, guru, magic eightball, whatever you need to do before doing anything. Let's go here. Number one thing we look for is free cash flow coming in in the meantime. Ah, okay. Mids singledigit clip trading above 200 tomorrow's newspaper today. Until then, we sit on our hands and collect our 4% dividend and wait. Top 10 uh points. Number one, organic net sales rose 1.7% ahead of street consensus of 1.4 driven by.9% volume growth and8 price mix growth. Management noted that the tariff driven pull forward behind last quarter's 5.9% year-on-year growth has largely cycled through with inventory levels now normalized. Number two, Diagio gained or maintained share in 65% of total net sales across measured markets including the US and delivered organic growth in four or five regions. Sales rose 1.5% in North America, 9.2% in Latin America and Caribbean. If you remember, that's where they had all the problems when the stock tanked. Uh so that's now recovering.3% in Europe, 10.5% in Africa, while Asia-Pacific declined 3.2% on weaker China and travel retail. I can tell you one thing in Africa where they've got 10.5% growth they're not worried about ompic and they're not worried about uh zero calorie zero alcohol Dagio they're selling the real stuff and they're selling it by the boatload three Guinness remained a standout during the quarter delivering 13% organic net sales growth and gaining share in its top three markets Great Britain Ireland and the US Guinness 0.0 Zero continues to expand, driving 40% growth in Diagio's non-alcoholic portfolio, where the company leads the market at four times the size of its nearest competitor. Don Julio was another highlight, up 38% organically and gaining share in 90% plus of measured markets. Number four, management raised its cost savings target under the Accelerate program to $625 million from $500 million over three years. 50% of the savings are expected to flow through to the bottom line, supporting mids singledigit organic operating profit growth for fiscal year 2026 and sustaining a 29% sectorle leading EBIT margin with the remainder reinvested for growth. Diagio generated 2.75 billion in free cash flow for the year, up 139 million year. Improving cash flow remains a top priority for management with guidance for at least $3 billion annually starting in 2026, which includes a one-time accelerate program cost with upside potential as the business recover at current prices. This implies free cash flow yield of at least 5%. Six, cleaning up the balance sheet remains a top priority with DI Dagio ending the quarter with 21.9 billion in net debt and 3.4 times net leverage ratio in line with prior guidance of 3.3 to 3.5. management retrain remains on track to hit 2.5 to three times net debt to IBID target by fiscal year 2028 at the latest seven% of Dagio's business is unaffected by US tariffs with most products exempt under USMCA management expects a $200 million annualized operating profit hit but aims to mitigate 50% in year one before broader tariff specific pricing actions Eight management expects capex of 1.2 to 1.3 billion for the coming year, down from 1.5 in fiscal year 2025 as they continue to focus on improving return on invested capital and higher growth opportunities over the next three years. Capex is projected to decline to a mid singledigit percent of next sales versus 7.7 in fiscal year 20259. Diagio has a track record of active portfolio management and remains committed to pursuing disposals of non-core assets. However, despite earlier rumors, management has no plans to sell Guinness or its stake in Moet Hennessy at this time 10 for fiscal year 2026. Management expects organic net se sales growth near fiscal 2025 levels uh ne negative one uh which is 1.7% with slowly slightly negative first half and accelerating second half which would imply organic sales growth in the 4% range. They anticipate a return to positive operating leverage as cost savings kick in driving mids singledigit organic profit growth which includes the current impact of tariffs. So that's the story there. Can read all the key highlights from the earnings call. Fear and greed is at neutral levels. National Association of Active Investment Managers a little fear in there. Healthcare top 30 weights revised down 2.44%. That's why people are so bearish on it. The biggest downward revisions have been the insurers like Elevance, Sigma, UNH, and then a few drug companies. But for the most part, on a company by company basis, most of them have been revised up. PPI, as we discussed, was expected to come in at 3.3%, came in at 2.6%. That's a preview of coming attractions. They might be late with these cuts, but if they if they get caught up quickly, it'll be fine. You can see earnings are now back over not only at 300, but remember they got down to like 293 for next year. They're now at 303. Uh,",

We brought the basis down to to 82 and change. And by the way, you know, it's unbelievable. We got a ton of options expiring in uh in January that were spreads that we bought between 65 and 70, and we were taking off. You know, the max expected value on those is 7x. And we were taking off a ton, millions upon millions of dollars between 5 and a half and 6x. So, we could wait for the seventh X. But when you're up 450 to 550% on millions upon millions of million, you ring the register. Did we sell one single share? No. the the move in Alibaba is just beginning, but it's so far past the spread of our strikes when we bought at 65 and 70 cents when everyone was puking in the hole and now we can sell close to $4.

And we booked a ton of that and and we got a ton more to book between now in January.

You don't get customers, your your your 9 billion is evaporated.\" And uh I think they knew that prior to inking the deal. And I think it's a quid proquo.

So, we've highlighted some of the key points. They've had 59 consecutive years of dividend increases, 97 years of dividend payments without interruption. Their dividend yield grows at a 5% compound annual growth rate. So basically every uh 12 every 14 years the dividend doubles at that pace. So in 14 years you'd be getting a 9% yield on your basis and growing. So call it, you know, 15, 16 years, your dividend will have doubled. The stock will have probably quadrupled. Uh and uh and your income keeps going up every year above the pace of inflation. It's unbelievable. Uh and people are clamoring to buy tea bills. So they took their sales guidance up from 2.1 billion to 2.15 billion mean uh net sales organic net sales growth up 2.3 2 to 3% operating income growth up 5 to 7%. 10 key points organic net sales rose 6% year-on-year to 3.3 3.03 03 billion accelerating for the third straight quarter and sharply above Q2's 1% growth. Growth was driven by volume plus 3% and pricing plus 2% and positive performance across all three segments. Two adjusted operating margins fell 80 basis points yearon-year to 8.4% as steep runup in commodity inflation completely eroded the benefits from the strong runup in topline growth. Beef costs remain near all-time highs. Pork bellies are up 30%, wholesale pork up 10%, driving a 400 basis points increase in raw material cost inflation in Q3 alone. Management is implementing targeted pricing actions and evaluating additional measures with profit recovery expected to lag into next year as cost pressures persist in Q4 and price hikes only partially benefit the the upcoming quarter. However, this is not the first time Hormell has faced high commodity prices in it 130 year operating history. They have a track record of successfully passing on costs in the past and we expect this time will be no different. Number three, the transform and modernize initiative rem remains on track delivering results in line with management expectations of 90 b 90 projects contributing measurable val value and earnings.

Topline strength was broad-based with five of six brands posting year-on-year growth. Geno was a standout, up 13% year-on-year, continuing to outpace the broader category and gain market share on top of its number one position. Spam also delivered another quarter year-on-year volume and net sales growth. Segment profitability was pressured by input costs with management expecting profits to begin to recover in 2026 as pricing actions take effect. The food service segment delivered 2% organic volume growth, 7% organic net sales growth, and segment profits down 1% year-on-year. Hormemell outpaced the broader industry despite ongoing pressure, including declining restaurant traffic and soft, higher margin convenience store visits. Premium pepperoni was a standout, posting over 20% volume growth. Management expects the pass through nature of costs in the food service portfolio to drive a faster recovery of profitability, which is key as the segment typically commands mid- teens operating margin versus high single digits at retail. Six, the international segment delivered 8% volume growth, 6% net sales growth, but its segment profitability fell 13% year-on-year. Topline strength was driven by thriving Chinese market and positive export results led by chi global the the global spam brand profitability was primarily impacted by ongoing competitive pressures in Brazil. Seven Planters acquired by Hormel in 2021 for 3.35 billion continues its turnaround achieving higher year-on-year growth in distribution, household penetration, and turning dollar sales positive by quarter end with capacity now in place to meet demand. Management expects continued sales momentum. On the bottom line, profit recovery is lagging expectations, though Q3 profit did grow, albeit more slowly, than topline gains. Eight. Management continues to prioritize the company's dividend aristocrat status, returning $159 million to shareholders this quarter alone through dividend payments, bringing total dividends to $474 million through Q3. This marks 59 consecutive years of dividend increases and the 388th consecutive quarterly dividend with a 5-year dividend growth kagger of 5%. Capex for the quarter totaled 72 million or 2.4% of net sales up from 65 million last year.

      "Two of the names we believe are well positioned to benefit from this rotation and the focus of this week's article are Hormel and Dagio.\n### FEATURED_COMPANY_DEEP_DIVES\nHormel just reported his fastest topline growth in nearly 3 years plus 6% yearonear. Let me repeat that. Fastest topline growth in nearly 3 years. 6% yearonear as the protein craze continues to show no signs of slowing. Unfortunately, a steep and unexpected rise in commodity costs caught Horell off sides, erasing much of that benefit and putting earnings under pressure. Par for the course this earnings season, the market overreacted, sending shares down 13%, we were in the market buying as many shares as we could. And for those who sold us shares in the whole, we thank you for your service. So you can see here hogs they do you know bacon and all that stuff live cattle horell dinty beef stew uh and feeder cattle has gone parabolic it's now starting to break down when these commodities break like you saw in 2014 and you in live and feeder they don't break down a little they break down abruptly and the trend continues for three years that's when you're going to see the restaurant stocks the horses of the world absolutely go straight up at the End of the day, Hormel has been compounding wealth since 1891, not 2021, 1891. They've been doing this for a while, ladies and gentlemen. To think this is the first time it has faced rising input costs over 130 years is laughable. As it has done many times before, Hormeell will work through a handful of quarters of margin volatility while passing through costs. Zoom out and this will be nothing more than a blip on the radar. On top of that, you have a proven CEO, Jeff Edinger, back at the helm to write the ship through October 2026 with plenty of time to work his magic and position the new CEO to step in as a hero. In the meantime, we'll continue to add shares where we can collect the five 4.5% dividend yield and growing by the way and watch this sleepy name recover. Okay, under Etinger last tenure during 11 years he had an a five bagger in 11 years. He came in when the stock was $7. He left when the stock was $38. Uh I think he's going to have at least a double if not a triple. Uh but probably between now and 2026, probably a double. Uh and then the new CEO will take it from there. In the meantime, you get a growing dividend yield and you get to lock in that dividend yield. And the reason that's important is because they are a dividend aristocrat. So, not only are you locking in that yield, but it keeps growing every single year. And when you can lock in a 4.5% dividend yield on Hormeell, uh, you know, 10 years from now, you're you've got a 10% yield on your basis and you've got a triple stock and a and a a perennial compounder for 130 plus years.

Their dividend yield grows at a 5% compound annual growth rate. So basically every uh 12 every 14 years the dividend doubles at that pace. So in 14 years you'd be getting a 9% yield on your basis and growing. So call it, you know, 15, 16 years, your dividend will have doubled. The stock will have probably quadrupled.

Management is implementing targeted pricing actions and evaluating additional measures with profit recovery expected to lag into next year as cost pressures persist in Q4 and price hikes only partially benefit the the upcoming quarter. However, this is not the first time Hormell has faced high commodity prices in it 130 year operating history. They have a track record of successfully passing on costs in the past and we expect this time will be no different. Number three, the transform and modernize initiative rem remains on track delivering results in line with management expectations of 90 b 90 projects contributing measurable val value and earnings.

Topline strength was broad-based with five of six brands posting year-on-year growth. Geno was a standout, up 13% year-on-year, continuing to outpace the broader category and gain market share on top of its number one position. Spam also delivered another quarter year-on-year volume and net sales growth. Segment profitability was pressured by input costs with management expecting profits to begin to recover in 2026 as pricing actions take effect. The food service segment delivered 2% organic volume growth, 7% organic net sales growth, and segment profits down 1% year-on-year. Hormemell outpaced the broader industry despite ongoing pressure, including declining restaurant traffic and soft, higher margin convenience store visits. Premium pepperoni was a standout, posting over 20% volume growth. Management expects the pass through nature of costs in the food service portfolio to drive a faster recovery of profitability, which is key as the segment typically commands mid- teens operating margin versus high single digits at retail. Six, the international segment delivered 8% volume growth, 6% net sales growth, but its segment profitability fell 13% year-on-year. Topline strength was driven by thriving Chinese market and positive export results led by chi global the the global spam brand profitability was primarily impacted by ongoing competitive pressures in Brazil.

      "Still generating 2.7 billion of free cash. Now moving on to Dagio. This is yet another straw hat. Buying straw hats in the winter. That's what we like to do, ladies and gentlemen. We buy straw hats when no one wants them in the wintertime. And then when everyone wants them in the summertime, uh we sell them at double. Shares have been cut in half as if consumers will never drink again. We're more than happy to take the other side of that trade. While consumers may be moderating, the real trend is clear. They are drinking less but drinking better. No company is better positioned to capitalize on this long-term premium immization than Diagio. Dagio is a classic story of cyclical downturns playing out within a long-term secular uptrend and we expect this cycle to be no different. The number one thing we can look for in a turnaround is free cash flow recovering and that is already well underway with management targeting $3 billion of free cash flow for the coming year. In the meantime, as management waits for the inevitable cycle to turn, they continue to focus on what they can control, cutting costs and positioning the company for the next leg of growth. Zoom out a few years and Dagio will be leaner, stronger, and benefiting from margin tailwinds tied to premiumization. It will be growing at a mid singledigit clip and trading above $200 tomorrow. In our opinion, again, you're at hedge fun.com. Uh, scroll to the top, click on terms. This is all opinion, not advice. Consult with your financial advisor, psychic, guru, magic eightball, whatever you need to do before doing anything. Let's go here. Number one thing we look for is free cash flow coming in in the meantime. Ah, okay. Mids singledigit clip trading above 200 tomorrow's newspaper today. Until then, we sit on our hands and collect our 4% dividend and wait. Top 10 uh points. Number one, organic net sales rose 1.7% ahead of street consensus of 1.4 driven by.9% volume growth and8 price mix growth. Management noted that the tariff driven pull forward behind last quarter's 5.9% year-on-year growth has largely cycled through with inventory levels now normalized. Number two, Diagio gained or maintained share in 65% of total net sales across measured markets including the US and delivered organic growth in four or five regions. Sales rose 1.5% in North America, 9.2% in Latin America and Caribbean. If you remember, that's where they had all the problems when the stock tanked. Uh so that's now recovering.3% in Europe, 10.5% in Africa, while Asia-Pacific declined 3.2% on weaker China and travel retail. I can tell you one thing in Africa where they've got 10.5% growth they're not worried about ompic and they're not worried about uh zero calorie zero alcohol Dagio they're selling the real stuff and they're selling it by the boatload three Guinness remained a standout during the quarter delivering 13% organic net sales growth and gaining share in its top three markets Great Britain Ireland and the US Guinness 0.0 Zero continues to expand, driving 40% growth in Diagio's non-alcoholic portfolio, where the company leads the market at four times the size of its nearest competitor. Don Julio was another highlight, up 38% organically and gaining share in 90% plus of measured markets. Number four, management raised its cost savings target under the Accelerate program to $625 million from $500 million over three years. 50% of the savings are expected to flow through to the bottom line, supporting mids singledigit organic operating profit growth for fiscal year 2026 and sustaining a 29% sectorle leading EBIT margin with the remainder reinvested for growth. Diagio generated 2.75 billion in free cash flow for the year, up 139 million year. Improving cash flow remains a top priority for management with guidance for at least $3 billion annually starting in 2026, which includes a one-time accelerate program cost with upside potential as the business recover at current prices. This implies free cash flow yield of at least 5%. Six, cleaning up the balance sheet remains a top priority with DI Dagio ending the quarter with 21.9 billion in net debt and 3.4 times net leverage ratio in line with prior guidance of 3.3 to 3.5. management retrain remains on track to hit 2.5 to three times net debt to IBID target by fiscal year 2028 at the latest seven% of Dagio's business is unaffected by US tariffs with most products exempt under USMCA management expects a $200 million annualized operating profit hit but aims to mitigate 50% in year one before broader tariff specific pricing actions Eight management expects capex of 1.2 to 1.3 billion for the coming year, down from 1.5 in fiscal year 2025 as they continue to focus on improving return on invested capital and higher growth opportunities over the next three years. Capex is projected to decline to a mid singledigit percent of next sales versus 7.7 in fiscal year 20259. Diagio has a track record of active portfolio management and remains committed to pursuing disposals of non-core assets. However, despite earlier rumors, management has no plans to sell Guinness or its stake in Moet Hennessy at this time 10 for fiscal year 2026. Management expects organic net se sales growth near fiscal 2025 levels uh ne negative one uh which is 1.7% with slowly slightly negative first half and accelerating second half which would imply organic sales growth in the 4% range. They anticipate a return to positive operating leverage as cost savings kick in driving mids singledigit organic profit growth which includes the current impact of tariffs. So that's the story there. Can read all the key highlights from the earnings call. Fear and greed is at neutral levels. National Association of Active Investment Managers a little fear in there."
