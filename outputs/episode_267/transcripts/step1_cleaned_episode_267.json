  "cleaned_transcript": "Split Decision here Dow&#39;s down 218 and the NASDAQ is up 109 points with me now is great Hill Capital chairman Thomas Hayes Trump wants to impose a 25% tariff on Canada and Mexico and to just to stem the flow of drugs and migrants across the border how come this major tariffs he&#39;s proposing here yeah how come the Market&#39;s not selling off well I think two things number one it looks like not only Mexico but also Canada is going to pay for that wall is is happening I think look Canada&#39;s had a free ride all the people that we&#39;ve rejected from coming in go through Canada it&#39;s like a Civ so this is his ask this is the starting point it&#39;ll come down if you look at the China tariffs overnight he said 10% more but there was a caveat because you&#39;re not imposing the death penalty on fentanyl Smugglers we are putting this 10% tarff that&#39;s a lot lower than advertised during the campaign isn&#39;t it so China&#39;s stocks were up overnight on that it&#39;s more moderate and I think this whole fear about tariffs do we are at the lowest tariffs in more than a century okay we had higher tariffs uh under Clinton under Carter than we have under Trump 2 to 3% of All Imports we have duties on they had four or 5% under under Carter and under Clinton and going back to 1918 everyone says oh tariffs holy Smoot this is going to be a huge problem he&#39;s going to put tariffs and we&#39;re going to crash tariffs in 1980 right after the Spanish Flu were 5% of all they grew for over a decade to 20% before Holly Smoot so there was a decade of increasing tariffs with a huge economy with a growing economy before Holly Smoot so this is a complete misnomer of history that the minute you put any tariffs on the market crashes you have a 10year Runway at least and we&#39;re starting at a much lower base than we did in 1918 you brought some stock picks with you I want to concentr right in just one and that&#39;s gener yes um I I have a gener generator and I kind of like this thing oh no question about it everyone needs a gener generator we came on the show in August the stock was $137 it&#39;s all the way up to 180 180 189 today uh some 40% since then this is going to go not only over 200 it&#39;s going to keep pushing higher 250 this thing was close to a $500 stock during covid they have 70% of the home standby generator uh system so you&#39;re not the only one that has it but you&#39;ve got more hurricanes you&#39;ve got more strain on the power grid they&#39;re the only game in town it&#39;s like the kleenex of Home standby generators Kleenex of home very good one a nice analogy there Tom good to see you thanks for being with us I hope you and your family have a wonderful Thanksgiving you too thank you staff and we&#39;re back and we&#39;re going to get to that data chart later so you can see what I&#39;m talking about uh and uh and the data behind a 100 Years of Duties on Imports and and how we are at that 100 year low so there&#39;s a lot of Runway ### MEDIA_APPEARANCE_RECAP\nand then I got a chance to join uh Liz Neo want to thank on CNA which is the BBC of uh Asia and based in Singapore huge audience and Audrey Tay for having me on the producer [Music] um and we have Thomas Hayes chairman and managing member at Great Hill Capital joining us for more now uh Thomas let&#39;s just have take a look at why investors are pivoting back to Cy cyclicals and and stocks and those names tie to the economy uh which of course help to push the down the S&P 500 higher overnight well Liz this is a theme that started o over the summer and basically what you&#39;ve been seeing since the beginning of the year is The Magnificent Seven or large cap Tech had 50% earnings growth and that is decelerating to about mid teens earning growth gr by the beginning of 2025 whereas the unmagnify or the the uh economically sensitive stocks as you reference to to uh their earnings growth has been accelerating it was negative in the beginning of the year and it&#39;s turning positive and it&#39;s going to move into mid double digits next year so I think people want to start to uh slowly add into the economically sensitive stocks they&#39;re more cheaply valued and their earnings growth is going up versus going yeah yeah and so with that comes the rotation out of big Tech at the same time um the tech names they continue to say that the AI theme is very much intact still uh despite some worries in the semiconductor sector how are you approaching investing in this sector and also um you know the sort of approach that the new Trump Administration could take with the tech industry yeah well I think people were eager to get through the Nvidia earnings report it missed the whisper numbers the guidance was a little bit mixed but it was good enough uh to get the market through they are the the issue with Nvidia is there was a time that as the stock went up it became cheaper because the multiple was coming down due to growth and growth in profit margins that&#39;s no longer the case the profit margins have stopped increasing the growth is decreasing the multiple is going up so while they could probably have maybe a couple quarters of of some stock appreciation uh I think a lot of that slowing down and managers as they get into the next year are probably going to have to lighten up as it&#39;s become a larger and larger part of their portfolio um as far as big Tech I think people are finding other opportunities if you looked at Deer today was a big Gainer but the biggest gainer you mentioned the Dow uh you mentioned the S&P you mentioned the NASDAQ and the difference in performance but the biggest performer was small cap stocks they were up 1 and a half% today and those are the biggest bang for your buck moving forward you get the most amount of growth over the next year for the least amount of multiple and I think you&#39;re starting to see more and more people Bren out looking for opportunities under the surface as maybe the indices gains led by large Tech start to slow down a little bit or certainly normalized relative to the past two years yeah and actually we see small cap you know starting to pick up pa um as you know calls for a trump Victory kind of firmed up and so you know when we look at the so-called Trump trade it&#39;s you know has been a bit of a a volatile movement I mean right after the election it was really good of course you know could be fed by by sentiment as well but then we saw B softness and now it&#39;s back up um where do you expect them to go from here uh and and and what is exactly that investors are searching for right now yeah Liz well it&#39;s interesting because there were two Trump trades in Trump 1.0 so you had the election in November of 2016 followed by the inauguration in January 2017 what happened after the election was different from what happened after the inauguration meaning uh the dollar rose right away after he was elected and bonds fell yields went up but after the inauguration the dollar re weakened and bonds got bid and yields came down and I think the two biggest surprises of 2025 Liz are going to be yields come down and the dollar goes down and right now people are positioned in the exact opposite way and we might be at the peak of that uh the other thing that people expect from a trump Administration is that energy will do exceptionally well that was not the case in Trump 1.0 if from the election to the inauguration energy stocks did extremely well after the inauguration in January energy did very very poorly in that first year of the Trump Administration as you get more Supply margins are compressed earnings power is compressed for the energy companies and I&#39;ll tell you another thing that did extremely well that again did poorly after the election and did very well after the inauguration was Emerging Markets stocks they did extremely poorly once he was elected and extremely well uh from 2017 to 2018 after he was in office you had one of the biggest rallies in emerging market stocks in the shortest period of time and that&#39;s including he was elected on tar who was elected on protectionism and those stocks still did well so we&#39;re in for a lot of positive surprises in 2025 that people may not yet be positioned for all right Thomas appreciate your insights and help us look ahead what we can expect uh when inauguration rolls around Thomas he chairman and managing member great Hill capital and that&#39;s that and then it says far more this is Peter Lynch\n\nwhat happened after the inauguration meaning uh the dollar rose right away after he was elected and bonds fell yields went up but after the inauguration the dollar re weakened and bonds got bid and yields came down and I think the two biggest surprises of 2025 Liz are going to be yields come down and the dollar goes down and right now people are positioned in the exact opposite way and we might be at the peak of that uh the other thing that people expect from a trump Administration is that energy will do exceptionally well that was not the case in Trump 1.0 if from the election to the inauguration energy stocks did extremely well after the inauguration in January energy did very very poorly in that first year of the Trump Administration as you get more Supply margins are compressed earnings power is compressed for the energy companies and I&#39;ll tell you another thing that did extremely well that again did poorly after the election and did very well after the inauguration was Emerging Markets stocks they did extremely poorly once he was elected and extremely well uh from 2017 to 2018 after he was in office you had one of the biggest rallies in emerging market stocks in the shortest period of time and that&#39;s including he was elected on tar who was elected on protectionism and those stocks still did well so we&#39;re in for a lot of positive surprises in 2025 that people may not yet be positioned for\n### QUOTES_OF_THE_WEEK\nfar more money has been lost by investors preparing for Corrections or trying to anticipate Corrections than has been lost in Corrections themselves that&#39;s an important thing to remember because you got this Cadre of folks that are always calling for Corrections for the last 15 years and kept people out of the market missing hundreds of percents of return doubling tripling their money and uh and potentially retiring earlier uh we had a late night uh that the club had uh the anything but Thanksgiving dinner last night so I was up till 2:30 a.m. doing the article of the week for you guys which I think you&#39;re going to find great and my lovely wife drove out to Duncan to uh get us some uh by the way they&#39;re not paying me uh I&#39;m not a Starbucks guy so um I keep it simple I grew up in Jersey uh got me this beautiful iced coffee so I could get this podcast out before our guests come and uh whether we&#39;re talking about stocks or or socks I like buying quality merchandise when it&#39;s markdown that&#39;s from the all-time great Warren Buffett who I&#39;ve learned so much from over the years and we followed that as well and the key thing here that I think people get messed up with with uh value investing and or quality value value and growth are joined at the hip it the key is quality merchandise growing earnings growing cash flow and then what do you pay for that growth what do you pay for that because far too often people get caught in businesses uh that are you know value traps and and only buying it on the basis of liquidation value with no plan for re acceleration of growth and and that&#39;s where people get tripped up or that&#39;s where a negative connotation comes from value and you have to be able to distinguish the two and then\n\n### QUOTES_OF_THE_WEEK\nfar more money has been lost by investors preparing for Corrections or trying to anticipate Corrections than has been lost in Corrections themselves that&#39;s an important thing to remember because you got this Cadre of folks that are always calling for Corrections for the last 15 years and kept people out of the market missing hundreds of percents of return doubling tripling their money and uh and potentially retiring earlier\n### TECHNICAL_CHARTS\nstop do better under reelected presidents early in their second terms so in theory we have a reelected president in president Trump uh there was a four-year Hiatus so that year one and year two this is consistent with um the presidential cycle in general where year one tends to be okay a little bit weaker in the first half of the Year followed by strength in the second half and then that midterm year tends to be the weakest of the four-year presidential cycle so um I think in uh next year our kind of base case is like a 7 to 133% on the S&P type of range uh and enor But but so much easier to make money because all the big gains will be under the surface in the non mag 7 so those stocks can be up 40 50 70 some 100% And The indices subdued and that&#39;s the environment where we can absolutely take advantage of so I&#39;m I&#39;m very very excited this is the Russell 2000 relative to the Russell 1000 seasonal patterns since 1979 um so the 2000 really picks up in December and into the first quarter that small caps we&#39;re excited about that they&#39;re also breaking out here this is Allstar charts uh just a standard small cap index and then biotech which is really interesting because we have exposure to the xbi if you remember we bought it in the hole here in 2022 uh it immediately rallied we thought we were geniuses then it Consolidated sideways went back and retested we held our ground we added more in the hole and now it&#39;s breaking out and what&#39;s interesting you see going all the way back is this converges with small caps with small caps taken off we are going to see a massive catch-up trade in xbi in 2017 and Beyond uh just like you saw in the early Trump presidency as well risk appetite comes back the game gets on so not only are small caps going to keep pushing higher as they did during that period but biotechs are going to catch up and we&#39;re going to Mint on both sides super excited for those of you who are with me US versus China equities this chart was posted by Scott granis to show the American exceptionalism and we 100% agree with American exceptionalism however what I look at and where I&#39;ve made my career is in capturing benefits of dislocated periods and divergences that is my knitting I do it very well in my view and um and I think what you see here that&#39;s more interesting than showing the US exceptionalism is the catchup trade how China both overshoots and unders shoots the US from time to time and the last time we had this dramatic of an shoot was in 2001 to 2002 which I continue to reference and you get this double bottom down here uh and then uh it starts to break out and checks back and then you have one of the most parabolic moves in China and emerging market equities in the shortest amount of time in history also under Republican Administration by the way uh and um not to by the way I mean US Stock markets do exceptionally well under Democrat presidents as well so I&#39;m not saying that to to make a point a partisan point I&#39;m saying that to make a point that the hawkishness expectations are sometimes overrated and this is setting up exactly like that period to rhyme like it&#39;s going out of style and to catch up and then overshoot the US performance I think we&#39;re going to see that and I think that&#39;s going to be one of the biggest surprise is of the Trump Administration very similar to the catchup we saw 2000 after the uh elected and then inaugurated and then catch CAU up to the US China performance and then overshot so that&#39;s a good thing um the 10year yield seems capped at five so bessent got elected and then it rolled over the interesting thing about bessent that was a coincident not a causal thing by the way what was underlying it was the excessive positioning that we&#39;ve covered in recent weeks as it relates to the commitments of Traders report and people the most offside on the bond trade hedge funds the most short bonds that they&#39;ve been since October 2018 which preceded one of the largest Bond rallies compression of yields that we&#39;ve seen in many many years and I think we&#39;re nearing that same type of thing and this has come in even a little bit more uh Economist upgrade China&#39;s exports and growth Outlook dollar advance may be tempered by bent nomination says nothing to do with the bessent that&#39;s is coincident it&#39;s helpful it doesn&#39;t matter matter what the Catalyst was going to be if it was going to be Russia lobbing a bomb into the Ukraine and bonds get bid it doesn&#39;t matter the positioning was so off sides that the market disciplines that type of excessive behavior and that&#39;s exactly what happened as far as the coincident all you needed to look is at is the commitments of Traders on the dollar and on the bonds and you knew it was too crowded large Traders headcut funds on the ex alongside the boat so dollar will re weaken bond yields will start to come down and those will be the two biggest surprises of 20205 S&P versus healthc care sector performance last 12 months there&#39;s a lot of opportunities in healthcare we&#39;re positioned through xbi we&#39;re open-minded to pick up some more Health Care opportunities and um I think there&#39;s going to be a lot a big catch-up trade in the health care sector\n\nthe 10year yield seems capped at five so bessent got elected and then it rolled over the interesting thing about bessent that was a coincident not a causal thing by the way what was underlying it was the excessive positioning that we've covered in recent weeks as it relates to the commitments of Traders report and people the most offside on the bond trade hedge funds the most short bonds that they've been since October 2018 which preceded one of the largest Bond rallies compression of yields that we've seen in many many years and I think we're nearing that same type of thing and this has come in even a little bit more uh Economist upgrade China's exports and growth Outlook dollar advance may be tempered by bent nomination says nothing to do with the bessent that's is coincident it's helpful it doesn't matter matter what the Catalyst was going to be if it was going to be Russia lobbing a bomb into the Ukraine and bonds get bid it doesn't matter the positioning was so off sides that the market disciplines that

going to be a lot a big catch-up trade in the health care sector\n### MISCELLANEOUS\nmoving along\n\n### MACRO_DATA_SLIDES\ninitial jobless claims went down that&#39;s good May uh affect odds of a cut in December although it&#39;s been moving around it got down to a coin flip uh before I delete this one sentiment came down on the a aaii sentiment survey uh bullishness came down to 30% 37% bearishness went up so that&#39;s good there&#39;s not Euphoria so I think we can push High and there&#39;s just like who are the natural sellers in a year like this there&#39;s not much tax loss people don&#39;t want to pay the taxes until next year so like expecting a big correction in December just because we&#39;re quote unquote overvalued look at this this must be from the FED minutes these odds dramatically changed a week ago you had 55% odds of a December cut now you&#39;re back up to 70% cut uh chance of a cut in December so that&#39;s really good if they get this cut in uh I think they can be done for a while at least till after March uh they can just wait and see which would be really good because it will cement the idea that they are not a politically based organization that they did two cuts after the election and then they can just wait and wait and wait and maybe they&#39;ll only need one more in 2025 by frontloading them very smart uh and maximum maybe two but uh that&#39;s the perfect mid cycle Playbook like we saw in 1995 another Regional manufacturing ticking up Japan inflation holds above boj Target Fanning December rate hike bets we&#39;ve been talking about this ladies and gentlemen stronger Yen weaker dollar money flows out of Japan back into China this is the theme this is happening in real time natural gas prices turning around like nobody&#39;s business I mean by the way what about Comstock resources like I say we we rarely spend time on the winners but that thing&#39;s up from $9 to $15 in like the last five weeks that&#39;s like a you know 55 50 6 six times about 60% gain uh and we don&#39;t even talk about it but we love that that&#39;s going to continue to work higher intrinsic values a lot higher and uh a few bags from here biggest outflow from healthc care since December 2023 it&#39;s one of the reasons I love Healthcare right now we also saw the exact same thing right after Trump got elected and what outperformed xbi afterwards dollar is expensive we agree going to roll back over re weaken probably related to the cut the hike that&#39;s coming from boj in December globalization to isolationism this is the chart ladies and gentlemen this is what I was referring to with Stuart vanney and um this is absolutely amazing because not only are us duties collected as a percentage of total Imports near 130e lows but they are lower than they were under Clinton under Carter for sure under JFK under all the favorite Democrats had higher duties and tariffs collected as a percentage of total Imports and for those folks saying if we do tariffs the Market&#39;s going to crash just like Holly Smoot go read a history book they put the tariffs on in 1930 and we got a great depression and the stock market crashed 90% well when you burden yourself with the facts you can see that right after the Spanish Flu which is just like we just had covid uh tariffs increased from a many decade low which they bottomed at about 6% and over the next 12 years prior to Holly Smoot the percentage of Duties collected on total Imports Grew From 56% to 20% okay uh Forex 300% increase in tariffs for 12 years before Smoot Holly was announced in 1930 and you got your crash so put it in perspective number one we&#39;re starting from a much lower base and for those of you who don&#39;t know the 20s was one of the greatest booms in history economically speaking uh growth GDP the whole thing new Industries same thing we have it was called The Roaring 20s and we are going to have the Roaring and having the Roaring 2020s so you have a 10-year Runway even if Trump went crazy with tariffs which he won&#39;t because he likes to see the stock market go up um we&#39;ve got 10year Runway and this could go from 3% to probably 15% before we had a massive problem people like well how how can that happen because you&#39;re going to see a lot of massive real and nominal GDP growth over the next four years plus and um so put this chart print it out put it on your wall and for the next two years every time you hear the word Smoot Holly you can Snicker and buy stocks so uh two years in a row isn&#39;t a reason to be bearish when the Market&#39;s up 20% two years in a row uh this is Ryan Dietrich at Carson showing the average return for the next year is 12.3% median 12.8% my favorite chart of all time this is emerging market stocks relative to US Stocks going back and all I can say is again the these are the opportunities where fortunes are generational fortunes are made when you can catch these lows these divergences like you haven&#39;t had since the Reagan error second term of the Reagan error second term of the Trump error when Emerging Markets relative to us markets were as cheap as they are and Bush to in 2001 again two Republican administrations uh and then you also had Carter you had uh Nixon before Carter and you saw this come off the bo come off the lows uh Emerging Markets being the Rock Bottom cheap relative to the US and the big analogy I like to use is 2001 we&#39;re we&#39;re lower than that level and the fortunes that are going to be made by the people that take advantage of this and look we could be wrong and it could take two more years to bottom out but it doesn&#39;t matter when you&#39;re buying with that margin of safety and you&#39;re not on Leverage I&#39;m going to bet we&#39;re there now okay and um and once it gets started it is so it&#39;s unreal it is unreal so there we are consumers are bullish on stocks this was posted um this is from Renaissance macro as a reason to get cautious except for the fact that when you see consumers get bullish on stocks after the these great despondent levels like 2009 like 2011 like 1991 recession that first spike is just the beginning of good things to come when you&#39;re coming off those lows same thing with 2003 beginning of good things to come 2009 2011 and so on so this extreme is is the beginning because you&#39;re coming off such lows it over overshoots on the low end overshoots on the upper end big gains after big gains return tend to be more moderate okay well we saw Ryan stuff that&#39;s actually more empirical this is also interesting during the 2018 to 2019 trade War margins came in below what volume growth implied so what they&#39;re trying to say is because of the trade War margins deteriorated except for the fact that margins were still higher than they were under Clinton in the late 90s and the stock market did well after the midcycle correction in 1995 uh so again coincident versus causal are two different stories and you have to be wary of getting faked out and the secret to not getting faked out in my experience is uh zoom out okay so don&#39;t just look oh well that if margins are going to contract I better get out of stocks because of the trade War if you go back you can see when tariffs were higher on Clinton the market had the biggest growth in the shortest amount of time from the midcycle correction 95 and the FED stepped in did a few cuts and We R even though margins were even lower than they were during the quote unquote trade War so we&#39;re tariffs by the way under under Clinton uh consumer confidence index turning back up Global money market funds elevated that money is going to come back in demographics are tailing to housing demand look how many 33 year olds this is why we&#39;ve been pounding the table un roaring 2020s demographics Drive spending you buy a house you buy a car you buy uh a crib you buy diapers you buy uh stuff to show off in your 30s when you care about that stuff uh buy your 40s you&#39;re already comfortable with what what you&#39;ve accomplished and uh and who you are and then you just do it for the love of the game but um but that drives spending and this is where we are ladies and gentlemen and by the way China&#39;s similar they&#39;re a little bit older but they got you three to five years and by the way for everyone who thinks I&#39;m a China Dove and I love China and all that stuff nothing of the sort let me tell you something I will be twice as pessimistic on China as I am on Japan right now five years from now when their demographics change I just deal with data I don&#39;t care about ideology and narratives and feelings and all that stuff I deal exclusively with data and right now it&#39;s time to buy China and it&#39;s time to buy the US and that&#39;s going to persist for at least 5 to seven years Plus in the US probably it could go as much as 10 years in China I think it&#39;s a fiveyear window we&#39;re going to see massive growth in a short amount of time and then we are going to be out of China and for those who think China is going to be the next great power uh it&#39;s going to be the next great Japan after that last parabolic move go back and look at the Nik index and the demographics of the late 80s for Japan same exact story their toast the one Child Left Behind is going to hit them it&#39;s not going to hit them in the next five years they&#39;re still golden it&#39;s going to hit them after that and they&#39;ll never be able to recover so don&#39;t worry about that us homes are getting smaller I should do more of these podcasts on coffee this is wild this is a theme we&#39;ve been talking about think levit Town we&#39;re going to solve the housing thing under Trump they&#39;re going to build so many small homes it&#39;s going to knock your socks off they&#39;re going to get the zoning uh thing so people can get reson they can build the houses get people in houses raise families rock and roll absorb new new positive immigration which this country makes this country great You&#39; got to have massive immigration you just want to have a a a a um systems in place to make sure you&#39;re not letting in the wrong things and if you look at Trump&#39;s tariff threats all three of them were related to Fentanyl and I think if you know anything about Trump and you read the art of the deal uh or you watch a movie I watched this movie called The Apprentice it was a hitpiece on Trump before the election I didn&#39;t find it to be a hitpiece actually I learned a lot about it watching it and I thought it was pretty useful um but you know they showed how his brother died because he was an alcoholic and I think this is an important issue for Trump uh in that he is so focused on keeping the Fentanyl and JD Vance who grew up in a drug uh I think his mother had drug problems uh keeping that stuff out of this country that Trump&#39;s announcement of China tariffs wasn&#39;t like CH China we&#39;re going to tariff you ideologically because we don&#39;t like you like you know other ideological uh groups had been doing he&#39;s saying you have not kept your word on the death penalty for people pushing fanol into our country through the Mexico and Canada borders therefore we&#39;re going to increase another 10% by the way not 60% another 10% which is a lot less than advertised he also said the same thing to Mexico and he said the same thing to Canada you&#39;re going to keep letting these drugs pour into the country and kill our people in the midwest who are struggling then the hardworking people then you&#39;re 25% tariff 25% tariff all of a sudden the lady got on the phone president of Mexico she said I&#39;m sorry we&#39;re going to we&#39;re going to close it down now it&#39;s not that simple it&#39;s not like a door they can just lock the door but it&#39;s moving them in the right direction Trudeau same story they&#39;ll get it right they&#39;ll come to some accommodation but you know the free lunch is over and uh and I think that&#39;s going to be a great thing for the country in the near term and look for those of you who are not in accordance with that benefit from the ride everything reverts to the mean so it&#39;s going to it it&#39;ll go back to the center in a couple of years maximum four years probably two years but I think it&#39;s going to lay a framework for many many years of growth ahead and jobs and and people that are not in the top 1% and not in the top 5% and not in the top 10% the people that actually build stuff with their hands that have made this country at the amazing country that it is are going to start doing exceptionally well like they did from 20167 to 2019 uh before the the flu came in uh and there&#39;s nothing like it I mean you can just feel the excitement in the air when you&#39;re out there people are you know in in the stock market we call it animal spirits we&#39;re going to see some data on that but just generally people are happy they feel good and I think that&#39;s going to go a long way that confidence ticking back up to uh really having a great great run the next four plus years economically speaking for a lot of people not just a few people for a lot of people and uh Bank of America so they&#39;re looking at GDP uh they&#39;ve taken their estimates up a little bit uh higher for 2025 GDP up to 2.3 I think they&#39;re going to be low there unemployment rate they&#39;ve taken it down from 4.5 to 44 inflation they&#39;ve taken it up okay so they&#39;re kind of that thing but if you actually look at the first Trump Administration inflation actually trended lower you get 3 million barrels excess of energy back on the market from increasing land leases and all that stuff uh that is going to be a big deflationary factor the second thing is if they cut 50% of what they&#39;re talking about at Doge and if you&#39;re betting against VC and elon&#39;s ability to get stuff done uh you&#39;re making a strong mistake I you know I think that especially because it&#39;s going to come down to the Supreme Court and uh I you know I can&#39;t see two trillion but these guys continue especially Elon has continue to surprise us it always takes longer than than he says it&#39;s going to take but he eventually gets it done so uh I don&#39;t know about two trillion that would be deflationary and Trump likes to see the market the stock market go up but a trillion to 500 billion I think is in the bag and that&#39;s deflationary bring inflation down will be offset by some of the stimulatory practices deregulation Etc home equity lines of credit have increased the regredi if that&#39;s a word of the American Consumer is just beginning you&#39;re going to see consumption come back in spades that&#39;s going to help a lot of our consumer discretionary Etc one of which we&#39;re going to talk about today US Stock Market concentration record high that&#39;s going to be changing 75y year high in US Stocks versus rest of the world that&#39;s going to be changing doesn&#39;t mean US Stocks crash means that rest of world starts to outperform in a meaningful way BFA forecasting 124 rate cuts by global central banks in 2025 that could be part of the reason why uh out us uh xus starts to outperform and these are periods as we&#39;ve covered before when you see these plus Century marks of global fed Cuts it&#39;s time to be buyers in the whole not sellers you don&#39;t want to be selling stocks in 2009 with 205 Cuts you don&#39;t want to be selling stocks in uh 2020 Co lows when there&#39;s 162 Global Cuts same thing in 2024 153 plus 154 this may be the most amount of cuts in the shortest period of time in history you want to be a seller of this no you want to be a buyer and you want to be a buyer of international to get the most value for your buck price is what you pay value is what you&#39;re going to get this major Chinese ETF set for record monthly outflows they&#39;re selling in the hole we&#39;re buying in the hole we now have meaningfully more options on Baba than we did before the September Spike where we took off uh I think it was like 80 90% we still have a few of those by the way um at monstrous profits so um I&#39;ve never been more excited and I&#39;m so grateful if you remember when teer went on TV and said buy everything buy everything and uh I&#39;m going over my position limits blah blah blah and um and he said I&#39;m praying that we get a massive pullback here so that I can go way over my position limits and buy way more than I&#39;ve already bought and Baba is his number one position by the way uh and what now that we got that pullback okay and this week everyone was under the table round trip okay we were buying and I&#39;m sure terer was also buying in the hole and you&#39;re going to over the next 12 months what happens after the inauguration we&#39;re very excited about that I mean I was so excited to see what happened in September October and so grateful for that uh it just went parabolic we had to hit the window on the options we didn&#39;t sell a share of stock by the way so yeah we you know so uh but I didn&#39;t think we&#39;d get an opportunity to extend out and to get this type of exposure in the hole it&#39;s super duper exciting uh pce prices going down moving in the right direction continuing job jobless claims moving up that is probably what got the um maybe I should switch to water too much energy here uh that is probably what got the FED odds back up to 70% which is huge four-week average coming down of the jobless claims Services PMI continue to climb that&#39;s massive expansion just like you see off major lows uh consumer sentiment index turning up last month or so turning up household consumption consensus forecast turning up since the election Japan department store sales collapsing below the zero line everyone piled into Japan last year they&#39;re getting taken out to the Woodshed that doesn&#39;t preclude buying cheap Japanese companies that do most of their business abroad there are opportunities there and smart people know where to find them but um chasing the crowd after the move is not the way to go net bullish opened option strategies so you&#39;re seeing this uh but that&#39;s just at the nent early stages of animal spirits biggest outflow in the past two week from treasuries again exact wrong time when did you see that late 2018 before the biggest rally in bonds

markets eia says we&#39;ve seen it in the natural gas prices here&#39;s the Russell 2000 breaking out to all-time highs couldn&#39;t give it away last year we kept pounding the table everything thing everyone said shut up with your small caps already there were two guys talking small caps three guys uh Tom Hayes Ryan Dietrich and Tom Lee in big ways everyone gave Tom Lee a lot of you know what because they didn&#39;t go up 50% in 5 minutes so it&#39;s taking a year and a half uh maybe 18 months and uh and now people are like oh yeah that that makes sense uh midcaps versus large caps just starting to turn the corner this is a proxy for small cap relative value as well uh and that huge opportunity last time we saw was in 2020 it&#39;s happening all over again small cat uh us S&amp;P price index um who is this Deutsche Bank is saying it&#39;s going to get to 7,000 by the end of next year I think that&#39;s a little optimistic I think that takes two years or a year and a half at least uh then you&#39;ve got S&amp;P 500 sector groups earnings growth for next year forecast so they&#39;re seeing huge earnings growth in uh in materials we&#39;ve got album Mar we got to get more materials exposure if we can find some maybe some in the a space those are so cyclical but they might get interesting you also saw Carl icon do that uh here&#39;s the 10year rolling over as we had anticipated it&#39;ll be fits and starts but that&#39;s the direction of path fomc men mentions of restrictive or related words and phrases collapsing so but they are still restrictive they do have to come down probably a couple of cuts more to be in neutral territory but they don&#39;t have to come down six more that&#39;s for sure three is a terminal 3% terminal rate is not going to happen consumer conference board confidence just spiked up in the last month consumer expectations spiked up in the last few months consumer board one-year inflation expectations still going down Advanced decline this is the S&P 500 shows how breath is improving midcaps breaking out Advanced decline small caps breaking out Advanced decline cap growth going up uh options Traders Target higher US Treasury yields this is the perfect example of the crowd being doing the exact wrong thing at the exact wrong time so just as 10-year yield Trump got elected 10 year yield went up to 4.4 and change what did they do like Lemmings they all went out and bought options on 465 485 and these are all the macro funds all you know they just because they wear ties and have fancy credentials doesn&#39;t mean they&#39;re not Lemmings and they don&#39;t crowd into the wrong things at the wrong time and uh and that&#39;s exactly what happened here so what&#39;s going to happen all of this premium is going to evaporate and the Schmucks who bought it are going to be left with goose egg and the Geniuses who sold it are going to M mint money and uh and that&#39;s the way the game works rolling four-year average flows positive the last two weeks this is net buys of us equities uh uh they&#39;ve been selling all year long while the indices have gone up and now they&#39;re playing the catch-up trade into year end Average stock trades as a wide discount to the index this is where the fortunes are going to be made ladies and gentlemen in the next year uh in the uh Average stock valuation relative to the S&P is so inexpensive and we didn&#39;t haven&#39;t seen this since 2001 which has been a template for what we&#39;re talking about in in coming years top seven S&P companies account for 30% of The Benchmark that is going to change uh Peak growth priced in for the Magnificent 7 you haven&#39;t seen this level of extreme since two late 2021 before the mag 7 dramatically underperformed in 2022 and a lot of people got smoke chasing at the end of 2021 when they didn&#39;t want to buy in 2020 I&#39;m not saying mag 7 is going to crash I am saying they are are going to underperform over the next two years uh no and they have been for the last six months by the way um valuations currently suggests 0 to 1% per anom price returns over the next decade I love this this is so beautiful ladies and gentlemen because they&#39;re basically saying all the gains for the next decade are gone you&#39;re going to get no gains from S&P and you see this lost decade every few years the uh I&#39;m not even G to point out but just Google lost decade and you&#39;ll see all the people from uh the lows in 2009 who have been saying it for the last 15 years and uh they used to manage trillions of dollars of money and these guys were just getting it wrong for a decade and we haven&#39;t been this low in terms of expectations the secret to happiness is low expectations since when since 2001 and you had the biggest growth in the shortest amount of time in emerging market stocks when expectations for US Stocks were at zero for the next 10 years and that&#39;s exactly where we are now and people are using this as a reason to say get out of stocks at the exact wrong time uh and you wanted to be getting into stocks in 2001 not only us to a lesser extent but to a larger extent xus Emerging Markets lower financial leverage than the 1990s and 2000s so healthy balance sheets higher quality composition than prior decades more asset light so you it warrants higher multiples as the point they&#39;re making economic data surprises have turned more positive we covered the margin issue m&amp;a tracking above 2022 and 2023 levels uh that&#39;s going to persist the question is how much of it&#39;s priced into the big Banks which is why we took profits on City over the summer which basically has done nothing since um so if we get some type of pullback scare which usually you do in February people start taking gains um and raising cash for taxes and all that stuff so February you usually get weakness in the market maybe we&#39;ll have an opportunity to re-enter some of the bigger Banks then typically IPOs outperform in both the short medium and long term uh so you see the first few months they do well and by so there&#39;s an opportunity to look at IPOs that are three years old and left for dead there were a ton of them in 2021s and and now a bunch of them are getting cheap enough that it&#39;s it is getting very interesting so that&#39;s going to be an area of focus next old economy sector stand to benefit most from regulatory laxity materials industrial consumer discretionary we&#39;re positioned for all of those uh growth for materials Tech and healthc care this is earnings growth for next year so materials again we got to pay attention to healthc care biotech Industrials consumer services Etc uh opportunities there goods and services consumption remain depressed but is likely bottoming this is going to be great for for the likes of um the gooses of the world the van the VF corpse of the world Etc including the mag 7 consensus expects just 2.5% volume growth in 2025 against easy comp of just plus five uh. five% in 2024 so there was basically a retail and consumer you know mini recession in 2024 that probably uh troughed in uh this most quarter that&#39;s just been reported and we&#39;ll re accelerate in Q4 I think we&#39;re going to have a solid holiday season and uh a lot of those retailers and consumer discretionary names are going to do better than people expected after a soft Q3 with the weakness into the election uh anticipating and you can see the expected growth moving forward consumer services Health Care uh real estate utilities Etc volume growth since hiking cycle has been negative but demand recovery equals margin expansion we&#39;re seeing that materials Industrials and Tech are expected to drive the biggest margin expansion in 2025 same story the worst of the inventory destocking cycle is likely behind us again for those of you think you missed it it&#39;s just starting we&#39;re kind of at the 2010 level uh and the 2002 level and you had many more years of rally Runway and if you think about it in terms of cars uh its early days of the recovery of volumes semis and Autos saw the biggest decline days sales of inventory year on year by S&amp;P across sectors this is going to reverse easing rate pressure should TR translate into pickup in manufacturing we agree uh mag 7 earnings are expected to slow while other 493 are expected to accelerate we&#39;ve been saying this is coming for the last six months it has come it is going to accelerate through 2025 indicator suggests 14% year on year EPS growth in Q4 versus 9% consensus that&#39;s a big deal we did 5.8% relative to 4.2% in Q3 we&#39;re going to jump in Q4 to uh 14% so selling stocks before the end of the year when no one has a reason to because they don&#39;t want to book the taxes and anticipating great earnings results for Q4 you don&#39;t want to be a seller probably through late January or February if you want to take profits take them then corporate Mis by the way all this is opinion not advice um uh go to hedge fund tips.com click on terms talk to your financial advisor Etc corporate misery index remains weak uh yeah week just like 2001 before biggest move in the shortest amount of time week just like 2009 week just like 1991 week just like 1982 you want to buy when the corporate misery indicator remains weak you don&#39;t want to buy when it&#39;s at the peak necessarily so uh labor productivity we covered that break out domestic investment is picking up after 10 years of under Investments mentions of reshoring increased sharply off the charts construction spent on manufacturing sword in recent years interest rates coming off 5,000 year lows yeah not fivey year 5,000 year lows uh rate cycl can last for four years so people are trying to extrapolate this is going to go up and up and up it&#39;s not going to go up and up and up because uh population in the developed world is is flatlining this is going to remain subdued you get these Spike UPS like in 1895 back when I was only three years old I&#39;m just joking uh and then it spikes back down but in the 18 1800s you saw tons of these uh there was one example here in 1930 to 1968 where it went straight up uh I don&#39;t think you&#39;re going to see a repeat of that because we&#39;ve got too much debt we first need to bring the debt to GDP down which we will we&#39;ll grow our way out of it which Bin&#39;s 3x3 plan let me see if I can remember this uh bring the budget deficit down to 3% um budget deficit three million more barrels of oil and they&#39;re going to bring the budget deficit down through um through the Doge cuts and through other other factors and they want to run real GDP hot which has been the Playbook that I&#39;ve been talking about post World War II why I love bessent because he&#39;s a student of History like I am like we are he understands the postor War II Playbook which I said they&#39;re going to run this Playbook I thought I thought Powell would figure it out Bon&#39;s going to be the guy to do it just like minutian knew the Playbook and they&#39;re going to run inflation and they&#39;re going to run uh nominal growth through the roof the next few years and that debt to GDP is going to start to collapse from 122 to down to uh below 100 and then beyond like from 1948 to 19 uh 56 went it went from 120 down to 63 inflation ran 3 to 5% nominal growth was was high single digits and we&#39;re going to see that type of environment and bessent knows the Playbook so that&#39;s his 3x3 plan perfect pick kudos to the administration for getting that right more than one in three Russell companies is unprofitable they say that like like it&#39;s a bad thing when&#39;s the last time you saw that was in 2010 you wanted to be a buyer of small caps you saw it in 2001 when you had the biggest rally in the shortest amount of time in small caps history and they&#39;re saying that like it&#39;s a bad thing it&#39;s a great thing that&#39;s what you see at the beginning of every small cap cycle uh you number of US Stock shrinking since the late 1990s so there&#39;s no Supply don&#39;t worry Wall Street when the Ducks are cracking Wall Street feeds them you&#39;ll see a ton of IPOs in the next two years forecast predict an 11% kager for electrical demand among data centers nuclear is going to take 10 years to get online where&#39;s all that power going to come from it&#39;s not going to come from solar panels ladies and gentlemen it&#39;s going to come from natural gas com stock resources corporate capex is consistent multiple of fiscal spend and is slated to grow not shrink uh valuations and positioning for Value over growth again once in a generation opportunity haven&#39;t seen since 2001 deep discount on PE to growth that&#39;s the PEG ratio haven&#39;t seen since 2001 this low price to book haven&#39;t seen in decades uh price to sales haven&#39;t been this low since 2001 these are just you get these opportunities once or twice in a career and everyone&#39;s at the wheel you know sleeping and trying to chase the the momo stocks that they&#39;re going to get their faces ripped off and and lose 80% of their money uh accelerating profits growth would historically favor value uh we expect earnings to accelerate in 2025 small cap earnings guidance now above average on a three-month basis same with midcap small caps remain relatively cheap to large caps back to 2001 again midcap same story materials trade below its historical premium again that materials narrative free cash flow yield is yes less compelling than it once was it&#39;s higher it&#39;s still higher it&#39;s still still a better opportunity than it&#39;s been in 25 years um communication Services relative to forward PE versus uh forward PE versus the S&P 500 again not a better opportunity since 2009 and then back to 2001 we uh so there&#39;s opportunity to find in there mag 7even earns expected to slow other 493 accelerate that&#39;s been happening and then macro cycle set to shift from recovery in 2024 to Boom in 2025 that&#39;s from haret one of the best in the business all this cash and money market 6.2 trillion has to put to work and they talk about bubbles over the last 50 years gold in the 70s Japan in the 90s Asia internet in the late 2000s housing in the early two uh late 99 late 1990s for internet housing in the early 2000s China in the mid 2000s biotech in 2014 uh uh Bitcoin came down Arc was a big bubble in 21 Fang and magnificent 7 so there you go ladies and gentlemen that&#39;s a lot of data for a holiday week fed odds we got merging markets we got November 2024 Auto Sale US Auto Sales showing signs of progress thanks to my buddy who sent that over uh basically what they&#39;re saying is November is up to 1 .31 units a growth of 6% from the year ago level that&#39;s with record high interest rates wait till rates continue to come down um credit is is starting to flow and that translates into uh a 15.9 million SAR in November on Trend with the 16 million unit Mark realized in October so remember everyone was pessimistic after September it bounced right back fed Williams sees inflation Cooling and interest rates falling further we like the story on that that&#39;s confirmed by the December uh odds billionaire investor Howard marks is snapping up quote uninvestable Chinese assets legend in the business no one wants it he&#39;s going in and and uh and doing it how I learned to stop worrying about the national debt even though it&#39;s 35 trillion this is an article in the New York Post by Ken Fischer and he goes through all the data and inflation adjustments Etc it&#39;s worth reading um I&#39;m not comfortable with it because I I&#39;m comfortable with it not for the reasons that he lays out but he does lay out good reasons in terms of the the servicing and how they&#39;re going to deal with that uh I&#39;m excited because Bon&#39;s going to run the post World War II Playbook and bring that ratio down bond market Hal halts brutal run as buyers pounce on 4.5% yields us treasuries rally on bets that bessent will soften Trump&#39;s plans that and half the world is off sides on the bond trade this is super important the AI race is entering a new stage Nvidia won&#39;t be the only winner this time okay now why is that important ladies and gentlemen we are see okay at some point ai&#39;s emphasis will shift from training that&#39;s the large language models that take up all that compute power all that energy all the data centers to inference the process of generating answers from results from the model so the models will be built that&#39;s the capital intensive phase many in the industry now believe that dedicating more Computing C power to inference can provide similar benefits to training it&#39;s cheaper less energy different type of chips what we are seeing we are seeing the emergence of a new scaling law with inference time compute nadela said at Microsoft&#39;s ignite conference the inference Focus has big implications for NVIDIA while training is uniquely suited for the company&#39;s gpus inference might be more readily handled by AI processors from Nvidia peers like Advanced Micro Devices and and Intel Intel ladies and gentlemen Intel Intel buy custom chips from Amazon or buy a range of Chip startups um this is huge because you&#39;re going to start to hear more and more from these hyperscalers talking about inference versus training the models training the models Nvidia wins inference Intel wins and this game is just beginning and it&#39;s going to be part driven by cost part driven by energy part driven by efficiency part driven by demands from shareholders for Returns on investments from the hyperscalers and we&#39;re going to move into the inference phase now that a lot of the language the model training is the majority is done there&#39;ll be more model training of course but the inference is where they&#39;re going to get the value for their Investments and Intel is going to be there to service that demand that is just getting started by the way they got their $8 billion from the government which is awesome stimulus rumors as insurance companies told to buy stocks this is China this is from my friend Brendan Ahern

we&#39;ll see how that plays out which means probably less tariffs than advertised China needs 1.4 trillion to boost domestic consumption amid impending trade War 2.0 so I think this is going to be a positive thing it&#39;s going to get maybe at this meeting that Brendan&#39;s talking about maybe it&#39;ll get them to do they did the 1.4 trillion uh in an indirect way they need to do it in a consumer way and maybe we&#39;ll see some of that in coming weeks uh last trump point1 it took till till after January 1st before the inauguration for China to start to take off maybe this time will

accounts is a little little over $111 a share this was a growth story that turned into a value story when we initiated and has a chance to turn back into a growth story if they execute on their plan and catch a little Tailwind in the Asia recovery as well as cyclicality they&#39;ve been through these Cycles many year many times since they started in 1957 so while it is still a small position for us I&#39;m looking for Windows that will make sense to upssize it into a full-size holding as the data confirms the original Outlook and thesis we&#39;ve been modestly topping up on weakness but have yet to lean in with a cannon so far we may never do it but I think uh we&#39;ll be paying close attention to opportunities as the data comes in so 10 key points from Canada Goose November 7th earnings results and call first off Revenue uh 192 million beat Expectations by 7.86 despite a 4.9% year-over-year decline uh EPS estimate beat estimates a company expanded its permanent store count to 72 locations if you remember from the long-term plan was to grow the DTC and reduce the wholesale inventory levels decreased by 9% uh net debt was decreased by about 25 million spring and summer collection was well received indicating potential for a robust annual lineup not just the heavy down lines e-commerce traffic increase suggesting growing online interest in the brand companies broadening its product range with plans to launch an eyewear line uh positive Trends have been observed in the Chinese market particularly during events like golden week and singles day the company&#39;s focusing on expanding the non- heavyweight down categories and diversifying into non-seasonal app Parable which could lead to yearr round Revenue opportunities the Cornerstone in other words the business is very cyclical I&#39;m going to show you the data and you&#39;ll see cornerstones of the turnaround plan are twofold reduce the wholesale and two make up the difference with broader product off offering and more DTC stores and high margin opportunities the expected long-term benefits of the DTC plan for Canada Goose include higher profit margins by eliminating intermediaries Canada Goose can capture a larger sale of the retail price leading to improved profitability over time enhanced brand control the DTC model allows Canada Goose to take greater control of its brand narrative and product distribution improve consumer engagement reduced wholesale presence allows for dependency less dependency on markdowns often seen in wholesale partners ship better Inventory management the shift to DDC enables more efficient inventory control as evidenced by the 9% decrease in inventory levels valuable consumer insights direct interaction with customers provides data that can inform product development and marketing strategies increased operational efficiency as Canada Goose optimizes DTC operations it may benefit from economies to scale in retail and e-commerce channels Global expansion opportunities the DTC model facilitates easier entry into new markets particular Ally through e-commerce enhanc customer lifetime value a strong DTC presence can potentially increase brand loyalty and customer retention agility and product offering direct sales allow for quicker adaptation to market trends and consumer preferences price is what you pay value is what you get while free cash flow has materially recovered price has remained subdued I built my career on capturing divergences like this and you can see free cash flow trailing 12 months accelerating when that happens historically what happens the price follows recovery in cash flow price follows recovery and cash flow price not following yet and will follow revenues continue to climb return on invested capital is still high single digits despite that we are in a trough recovery cycle destocking turning into restocking as the inventory management under control with reducing wholesalers gross margin still at 68% which is an unbelievable business and uh and then I want to get into more granular numbers and as I like to as I say on this uh article this is the Farah facet of financial pictures in my view in that the sales per share continue to go up the cash flow per share continues to go up the earnings per share continue to go up the sales continue to go up the operating margin what the only thing that has gone down is the price and we believe that that will start to play catchup look it&#39;s not all peaches and cream revenues were down 4% year on year but this is a cyclical enough business that you have to accept and trust that they will figure it out as they&#39;ve done since 1957 anytime you find yourself in a situation where the financials continue to recover and improve and the price continues to decline count your lucky blessings Mr Market is serving up one of his manic bouts to deliver you an opportunity to benefit from a rare Divergence in

Thanksgiving enjoy the football fun and family and here we go llan llan Neo Tom is this is more of a career question is the CFA useful to break into Finance how does one get into value investing career like yourself um yeah I think if you don&#39;t have any experience that&#39;s table Stakes so go get your CFA and if you&#39;re doing it to get a job save yourself time uh if you&#39;re doing it because you love it and you want to learn as much as possible as an investment in your future I would highly recommend that um next Eric first of all thanks for the amazing content you&#39;re putting out I can&#39;t find another podcast that even comes close as for the question of the week this is from sampy commas I okay um I know these are too large for you but Google and lvmh seem to me to be undervalued here valuations look good to me uh good cash flowing businesses with Good Financial Health that can perform great would love to hear your thoughts in any case thanks for so much for all the content you&#39;re putting out all right sampy thank you for writing in um you&#39;re probably newer so um you don&#39;t know our Google history but we were massive buyers of Google in the whole in late 2022 and early 2023 when no one wanted it in the 80s and 90s and we took profits this summer uh with more than a double bag in that and now that&#39;s you know up here everyone&#39;s getting interested uh I&#39;m not going to argue with you on that but uh you know we have to book wins and we were happy to book it and we have no urgency to get back in especially when we&#39;re using chat GPT and perplexity and uh meta AI uh a lot more than we have been in um recent years so I think Google will be fine I just don&#39;t think I think the opportunity would to buy it was when no one wanted it not when everyone wanted it as it relates to lvmh I think you&#39;re spot on but we have enough um consumer exposure and China exposure which this is basically just a play on the China recovery which we have through goose and Baba so um let&#39;s just take a look at here the financials all right so cash flow dropped it&#39;s recovering revenues gross margins same as goose 68% turn invested Capital so the stock&#39;s down about 40% I mean this is such a super high quality business that um I think you&#39;re going to be super right um but I think you might be a little bit early so yeah I I think you&#39;re probably okay with this I mean I think there are higher better uses for us but um I don&#39;t think you&#39;re wrong here I just think you got to wait a little longer than you think I I like that one better than Google to be honest with you um but not enough to get involved all right that&#39;s that Julian Julian Glock I see an increasing amount of people I follow expecting not only a pullback but rather a crash in q1 or Q2 of 2025 as markets seem stretched melting up to them now I was of course wondering about your take on this and if it should come to that whether you would hold long-term positions through such times or are there moments when you would go entirely to cash uh okay good question number one is the people calling for crashes are the ones that missed the rally number two I do expect a pullback in the first quarter probably 8 to 10% probably around February completely guessing and because of that no we would not sell any of our long-term positions uh unless they were at or fully invalu irrespective of our guess about when the next correction is going to come I don&#39;t believe it&#39;ll be a crash I don&#39;t believe it&#39;ll be 20% I do think we&#39;re due for an 8 to 10% pullback and I don&#39;t think it&#39;s going to come until at least uh Late July January early February at the earliest uh or mid you know late late January February at the earliest and the way that we will potentially participate in that is we&#39;ll use part of our options bucket to hedge or fine tactical shorts in the short term and the only benefit of that is just dampening volatility and creating some excess cash to go long um but um no we don&#39;t we don&#39;t guess about when the Market&#39;s going to pull back and try to be nimble and and silly about that because going back to Peter Lynch&#39;s more money has been lost preparing for Corrections than the actual Corrections themselves number two we don&#39;t run High leverage so we just deal through the volatility it&#39;s like would you sell your jersey mics uh if you own 20 Jersey mics uh stores and you know some Economist said there was going to be a you know 20% pullback in the stock market therefore people are going to have less money to buy sandwiches or less consumer confidence so for the next six months sales are going to be down sell all your your franchises in the whole at low price no you would say if you&#39;re smart and you want to get rich you would say oh I wonder if any of my competitors are going to sell at lower multiples in the next six months when sales go down so I can have 40 stores instead of 10 stores and buy up those opportunities because when it comes back I&#39;ll make even more money that&#39;s the way to think about it not going to cash and all this nonsense and and pretending to predict the markets so uh hope that helps and um good question ad guard after the latest meltdown do you think target can be a good entry opportunity do you think an activist investor might be eminent there thanks for the amazing content well I think number one is they got to start catching criminals who who are stealing all their merchandise because somehow uh Walmart has not had the same problem number two uh stop offering ridiculous products to children but we&#39;ll leave that aside uh I don&#39;t think that&#39;s the core I well I wouldn&#39;t count against it but let&#39;s just let&#39;s just focus on the numbers here um so you&#39;re seeing a Slowdown uh and you&#39;re seeing it reflected in the stock price both in free cash flow revenues stalling um I think they&#39;ve become a me too Rea retailer their G gross margins haven&#39;t recovered yet uh they don&#39;t have anything exciting or fresh is really what it comes down to I think they&#39;ve gotten sidetracked uh and I don&#39;t think that this is one I want to rush into just yet um and I think retailers if you remember from our last few podcast did poorly after the inauguration in Trump 1 um I think there will be a time to get involved I just think it&#39;s nowhere near ready yet um send it back in if it gets below 100 I&#39;ll take another look moving on Peter Webster here&#39;s one for your Emerging Markets banko Colombia is a well-run bank paying 10.4% dividends like Argentina t\n\nafter the latest meltdown do you think target can be a good entry opportunity do you think an activist investor might be eminent there thanks for the amazing content well I think number one is they got to start catching criminals who who are stealing all their merchandise because somehow uh Walmart has not had the same problem number two uh stop offering ridiculous products to children but we'll leave that aside uh I don't think that's the core I well I wouldn't count against it but let's just let's just focus on the numbers here um so you're seeing a Slowdown uh and you're seeing it reflected in the stock price both in free cash flow revenues stalling ### ASK_ME_ANYTHING_QA\nI think they've become a me too Rea retailer their G gross margins haven't recovered yet uh they don't have anything exciting or fresh is really what it comes down to I think they've gotten sidetracked uh and I don't think that this is one I want to rush into just yet um and I think retailers if you remember from our last few podcast did poorly after the inauguration in Trump 1 um I think there will be a time to get involved I just think it's nowhere near ready yet um send it back in if it gets below 100 I'll take another look moving on Peter Webster here's one for your Emerging Markets banko Colombia is a well-run bank paying 10.4% dividends like Argentina there is  an uplift if there's a change in government CIB I'm told is the best bank in Columbia Pete okay Pete well thanks for that I don't think there's a question there um I don't bet on potential changes in government and I don't tend to trust double digigit uh dividends staying intact it may prove to be correct but just taking a brief look this is already had a big run off the bottom uh it's a little late for my liking Greg altimari uh thanks for your input on oxy please take a look at di diio we own diio we like it it's going to be a bit of a track turnaround uh this is a new position for us we're not writing about it yet again this has China exposure this is going to benefit from Emerging Markets it did the exact same thing in when 2001 um so this is the best quality business yeah glp 1's have an impact but really this is a turnaround China recovery play and just looking at the numbers you can see that the stock price has overshot the deterioration in the financials they had a lot of pull forward during uh covid in terms of demand and now they're working through that and they had some issues in South America so prices come down with free cash flow revenues have been flat they need to re accelerate margins are holding up uh return on invested capital is solid continues to be double digits so this is just a waiting game it's the best game in town if you want to bet people will never drink again then you should get short the stock in the hole if you want to say people with you know people continue to like to escape you know I always tell my the one thing I like about what Trump did with his kids is no drinking no drugs no alcohol no tattoos there's nothing wrong with any of those stuff things in moderation I guess um uh but um the fact of the matter is since the beginning of time people have wanted to escape from reality and alcohol is one way they do it and glp ones or not glp ones I think they're still going to want to do it and I think diio is going to provide for that service so is it the investment that I'm the most proud of in my life no uh but again I don't deal in ideology I deal in numbers and the fact is there's a demand in the marketplace for this there's going to be a continued demand there's a growing new middle class in emerging market that is growing like a weed that is going to get involved in this space and they're going to have celebrations and they're going to have social Gatherings and they're going to have uh even if they're drinking less they're going to be more people drinking and diio is positioned to benefit from that so uh let people be happy the way they want to be happy and uh and we'll be happy uh taking it all the way to the banks so uh we like diio and good one there and we own it uh n n deep basine thanks for everything you and your podcast have been a blessing uh for your restaurant play could the ticket Yelp qualify Tech play to cover overall eatout dollars rising over the next four years kind of off the- wall but love to hear your thoughts you thankfully butchered my last beyond meat suggestion exactly uh there we go um all right thanks Nate happy to do this one let's do Yelp this is a trading vehicle this has been a crap business that continues to trade in a Range let's see if anything is changed in the numbers that can change our mind um all right cash flows going up or had gone up price gone up revenues went up turn on Capital margins are down uh this is a tricky one my friend I'd have to understand what the turnaround plan is and why it's sustainable why are the numbers modestly improving uh did they buy something did they consolidate the industry how's the balance sheet balance Sheet's great yeah the good news is you're probably right the bad news is it's probably only going to be a cyclical uh short-term trade uh back up to 50 but uh I hope I'm wrong about that I think you got a good uh trade uh I don't think you have a good long-term business let's move to Jimbo uh all right so he's saying know I like your buy of etsy at $48 uh what's your Target price uh we're not going to publish that that's for our current because then people are going to try to front run our exit but I can tell you this that we don't get involved in any stock that we don't anticipate a double inside of three years uh and um some of them are have much more than a double and then when you add our options overlays they all have more than that uh so I would say no less than a double in three years and uh and on most of them a lot more and then certainly a lot more when you add in the option overlay so we'll leave it at that um Matt tumbo says I've been in mmt uh yeah so that's something you've been in congratulations on a good trade uh ack short okay so he just wanted to pat on the back great trades Matt awesome glad you're listening glad to be helpful David mlan uh he's asking about alibaba's B2B isn't it incred yes it's all incredible that's not going to be the primary mover it's going to be a contributor as the economy recovers Alibaba is the Tollgate for the China recovery so if you believe like every cycle they recover uh dollar gets weaker Emerging Markets fly and all the case that we've made around that uh that's just going to be one of the factors that absolutely flies for Alibaba the only thing this time that's going to make it better than all the other times is they are the number one way to play AI in China uh most amount of value for the cheapest amount why because they have equity in every single AI startup in China because they just offer them compute Credit in exchange for equity and you're going to have things that you don't even know know you own as an Alibaba shareholder wind up being thousand Baggers and contributing materially to intrinsic value uh that's not even accounted for in addition to dominating uh uh Cloud compute AI e-commerce coming back when the middle class comes back and the higher end stuff comes in demand we're already seeing signs of that in the recent quarter as teu gets smashed and

    "MEDIA_APPEARANCE_RECAP": "\n\nSplit Decision here Dow&#39;s down 218 and the NASDAQ is up 109 points with me now is great Hill Capital chairman Thomas Hayes Trump wants to impose a 25% tariff on Canada and Mexico and to just to stem the flow of drugs and migrants across the border how come this major tariffs he&#39;s proposing here yeah how come the Market&#39;s not selling off well I think two things number one it looks like not only Mexico but also Canada is going to pay for that wall is is happening I think look Canada&#39;s had a free ride all the people that we&#39;ve rejected from coming in go through Canada it&#39;s like a Civ so this is his ask this is the starting point it&#39;ll come down if you look at the China tariffs overnight he said 10% more but there was a caveat because you&#39;re not imposing the death penalty on fentanyl Smugglers we are putting this 10% tarff that&#39;s a lot lower than advertised during the campaign isn&#39;t it so China&#39;s stocks were up overnight on that it&#39;s more moderate and I think this whole fear about tariffs do we are at the lowest tariffs in more than a century okay we had higher tariffs uh under Clinton under Carter than we have under Trump 2 to 3% of All Imports we have duties on they had four or 5% under under Carter and under Clinton and going back to 1918 everyone says oh tariffs holy Smoot this is going to be a huge problem he&#39;s going to put tariffs and we&#39;re going to crash tariffs in 1980 right after the Spanish Flu were 5% of all they grew for over a decade to 20% before Holly Smoot so there was a decade of increasing tariffs with a huge economy with a growing economy before Holly Smoot so this is a complete misnomer of history that the minute you put any tariffs on the market crashes you have a 10year Runway at least and we&#39;re starting at a much lower base than we did in 1918 you brought some stock picks with you I want to concentr right in just one and that&#39;s gener yes um I I have a gener generator and I kind of like this thing oh no question about it everyone needs a gener generator we came on the show in August the stock was $137 it&#39;s all the way up to 180 180 189 today uh some 40% since then this is going to go not only over 200 it&#39;s going to keep pushing higher 250 this thing was close to a $500 stock during covid they have 70% of the home standby generator uh system so you&#39;re not the only one that has it but you&#39;ve got more hurricanes you&#39;ve got more strain on the power grid they&#39;re the only game in town it&#39;s like the kleenex of Home standby generators Kleenex of home very good one a nice analogy there Tom good to see you thanks for being with us I hope you and your family have a wonderful Thanksgiving you too thank you staff and we&#39;re back and we&#39;re going to get to that data chart later so you can see what I&#39;m talking about uh and uh and the data behind a 100 Years of Duties on Imports and and how we are at that 100 year low so there&#39;s a lot of Runway ### MEDIA_APPEARANCE_RECAP\nand then I got a chance to join uh Liz Neo want to thank on CNA which is the BBC of uh Asia and based in Singapore huge audience and Audrey Tay for having me on the producer [Music] um and we have Thomas Hayes chairman and managing member at Great Hill Capital joining us for more now uh Thomas let&#39;s just have take a look at why investors are pivoting back to Cy cyclicals and and stocks and those names tie to the economy uh which of course help to push the down the S&P 500 higher overnight well Liz this is a theme that started o over the summer and basically what you&#39;ve been seeing since the beginning of the year is The Magnificent Seven or large cap Tech had 50% earnings growth and that is decelerating to about mid teens earning growth gr by the beginning of 2025 whereas the unmagnify or the the uh economically sensitive stocks as you reference to to uh their earnings growth has been accelerating it was negative in the beginning of the year and it&#39;s turning positive and it&#39;s going to move into mid double digits next year so I think people want to start to uh slowly add into the economically sensitive stocks they&#39;re more cheaply valued and their earnings growth is going up versus going yeah yeah and so with that comes the rotation out of big Tech at the same time um the tech names they continue to say that the AI theme is very much intact still uh despite some worries in the semiconductor sector how are you approaching investing in this sector and also um you know the sort of approach that the new Trump Administration could take with the tech industry yeah well I think people were eager to get through the Nvidia earnings report it missed the whisper numbers the guidance was a little bit mixed but it was good enough uh to get the market through they are the the issue with Nvidia is there was a time that as the stock went up it became cheaper because the multiple was coming down due to growth and growth in profit margins that&#39;s no longer the case the profit margins have stopped increasing the growth is decreasing the multiple is going up so while they could probably have maybe a couple quarters of of some stock appreciation uh I think a lot of that slowing down and managers as they get into the next year are probably going to have to lighten up as it&#39;s become a larger and larger part of their portfolio um as far as big Tech I think people are finding other opportunities if you looked at Deer today was a big Gainer but the biggest gainer you mentioned the Dow uh you mentioned the S&P you mentioned the NASDAQ and the difference in performance but the biggest performer was small cap stocks they were up 1 and a half% today and those are the biggest bang for your buck moving forward you get the most amount of growth over the next year for the least amount of multiple and I think you&#39;re starting to see more and more people Bren out looking for opportunities under the surface as maybe the indices gains led by large Tech start to slow down a little bit or certainly normalized relative to the past two years yeah and actually we see small cap you know starting to pick up pa um as you know calls for a trump Victory kind of firmed up and so you know when we look at the so-called Trump trade it&#39;s you know has been a bit of a a volatile movement I mean right after the election it was really good of course you know could be fed by by sentiment as well but then we saw B softness and now it&#39;s back up um where do you expect them to go from here uh and and and what is exactly that investors are searching for right now yeah Liz well it&#39;s interesting because there were two Trump trades in Trump 1.0 so you had the election in November of 2016 followed by the inauguration in January 2017 what happened after the election was different from what happened after the inauguration meaning uh the dollar rose right away after he was elected and bonds fell yields went up but after the inauguration the dollar re weakened and bonds got bid and yields came down and I think the two biggest surprises of 2025 Liz are going to be yields come down and the dollar goes down and right now people are positioned in the exact opposite way and we might be at the peak of that uh the other thing that people expect from a trump Administration is that energy will do exceptionally well that was not the case in Trump 1.0 if from the election to the inauguration energy stocks did extremely well after the inauguration in January energy did very very poorly in that first year of the Trump Administration as you get more Supply margins are compressed earnings power is compressed for the energy companies and I&#39;ll tell you another thing that did extremely well that again did poorly after the election and did very well after the inauguration was Emerging Markets stocks they did extremely poorly once he was elected and extremely well uh from 2017 to 2018 after he was in office you had one of the biggest rallies in emerging market stocks in the shortest period of time and that&#39;s including he was elected on tar who was elected on protectionism and those stocks still did well so we&#39;re in for a lot of positive surprises in 2025 that people may not yet be positioned for all right Thomas appreciate your insights and help us look ahead what we can expect uh when inauguration rolls around Thomas he chairman and managing member great Hill capital and that&#39;s that and then it says far more this is Peter Lynch\n\n### MEDIA_APPEARANCE_RECAP\nyesterday I quote unquote caught my buddy Lou Bassin on Cavuto Coast to Coast on Fox Business yesterday giving me a shout out on Disney and I

to be okay a little bit weaker in the first half of the Year followed by strength in the second half and then that midterm year tends to be the weakest of the four-year presidential cycle so um I think in uh next year our kind of base case is like a 7 to 133% on the S&P type of range uh and enor But but so much easier to make money because all the big gains will be under the surface in the non mag 7 so those stocks can be up 40 50 70 some 100% And The indices subdued and that&#39;s the environment where we can absolutely take advantage of so I&#39;m I&#39;m very very excited this is the

and what&#39;s interesting you see going all the way back is this converges with small caps with small caps taken off we are going to see a massive catch-up trade in xbi in 2017 and Beyond uh just like you saw in the early Trump presidency as well risk appetite comes back the game gets on so not only are small caps going to keep pushing higher as they did during that period but biotechs are going to catch up and we&#39;re going to Mint on both sides super excited for those of you who are with me US versus China equities this chart was posted by Scott granis to show the American

could tighten natural gas markets eia says we&#39;ve seen it in the natural gas prices here&#39;s the Russell 2000 breaking out to all-time highs couldn&#39;t give it away last year we kept pounding the table everything thing everyone said shut up with your small caps already there were two guys talking small caps three guys uh Tom Hayes Ryan Dietrich and Tom Lee in big ways everyone gave Tom Lee a lot of you know what because they didn&#39;t go up 50% in 5 minutes so it&#39;s taking a year and a half uh maybe 18 months and uh and now people are like oh yeah that that makes sense uh midcaps versus large caps just starting to turn the corner this is a proxy for small cap relative value as well uh and that huge opportunity last time we saw was in 2020 it&#39;s happening all over again small cat uh us S&amp;P price index um who is this Deutsche Bank is saying it&#39;s going to get to 7,000 by the end of next year I think that&#39;s a little optimistic I think that takes two years or a year and a half at least uh then you&#39;ve got S&amp;P 500 sector groups earnings growth for next year forecast so they&#39;re seeing huge earnings growth in uh in materials we&#39;ve got album Mar we got to get more materials exposure if we can find some maybe some in the a space those are so cyclical but they might get interesting you also saw Carl icon do that uh here&#39;s the 10year rolling over as we had anticipated it&#39;ll be fits and starts but that&#39;s the direction of path fomc men mentions of restrictive or related words and phrases collapsing so but they are still restrictive they do have to come down probably a couple of cuts more to be in neutral territory but they don&#39;t have to come down six more that&#39;s for sure three is a terminal 3% terminal rate is not going to happen consumer conference board confidence just spiked up in the last month consumer expectations spiked up in the last few months consumer board one-year inflation expectations still going down Advanced decline this is the S&P 500 shows how breath is improving midcaps breaking out Advanced decline small caps breaking out Advanced decline cap growth going up uh options Traders Target higher US Treasury yields this is the perfect example of the crowd being doing the exact wrong thing at the exact wrong time so just as 10-year yield Trump got elected 10 year yield went up to 4.4 and change what did they do like Lemmings they all went out and bought options on 465 485 and these are all the macro funds all you know they just because they wear ties and have fancy credentials doesn&#39;t mean they&#39;re not Lemmings and they don&#39;t crowd into the wrong things at the wrong time and uh and that&#39;s exactly what happened here so what&#39;s going to happen all of this premium is going to evaporate and the Schmucks who bought it are going to be left with goose egg and the Geniuses who sold it are going to M mint money and uh and that&#39;s the way the game works rolling four-year average flows positive the last two weeks this is net buys of us equities uh uh they&#39;ve been selling all year long while the indices have gone up and now they&#39;re playing the catch-up trade into year end Average stock trades as a wide discount to the index this is where the fortunes are going to be made ladies and gentlemen in the next year uh in the uh Average stock valuation relative to the S&P is so inexpensive and we didn&#39;t haven&#39;t seen this since 2001 which has been a template for what we&#39;re talking about in in coming years top seven S&P companies account for 30% of The Benchmark that is going to change uh Peak growth priced in for the Magnificent 7 you haven&#39;t seen this level of extreme since two late 2021 before the mag 7 dramatically underperformed in 2022 and a lot of people got smoke chasing at the end of 2021 when they didn&#39;t want to buy in 2020 I&#39;m not saying mag 7 is going to crash I am saying they are are going to underperform over the next two years uh no and they have been for the last six months by the way um valuations currently suggests 0 to 1% per anom price returns over the next decade I love this this is so beautiful ladies and gentlemen because they&#39;re basically saying all the gains for the next decade are gone you&#39;re going to get no gains from S&P and you see this lost decade every few years the uh I&#39;m not even G to point out but just Google lost decade and you&#39;ll see all the people from uh the lows in 2009 who have been saying it for the last 15 years and uh they used to manage trillions of dollars of money and these guys were just getting it wrong for a decade and we haven&#39;t been this low in terms of expectations the secret to happiness is low expectations since when since 2001 and you had the biggest growth in the shortest amount of time in emerging market stocks when expectations for US Stocks were at zero for the next 10 years and that&#39;s exactly where we are now and people are using this as a reason to say get out of stocks at the exact wrong time uh and you wanted to be getting into stocks in 2001 not only us to a lesser extent but to a larger extent xus Emerging Markets lower financial leverage than the 1990s and 2000s so healthy balance sheets higher quality composition than prior decades more asset light so you it warrants higher multiples as the point they&#39;re making economic data surprises have turned more positive we covered the margin issue m&amp;a tracking above 2022 and 2023 levels uh that&#39;s going to persist the question is how much of it&#39;s priced into the big Banks which is why we took profits on City over the summer which basically has done nothing since um so if we get some type of pullback scare which usually you do in February people start taking gains um and raising cash for taxes and all that stuff so February you usually get weakness in the market maybe we&#39;ll have an opportunity to re-enter some of the bigger Banks then typically IPOs outperform in both the short medium and long term uh so you see the first few months they do well and by so there&#39;s an opportunity to look at IPOs that are three years old and left for dead there were a ton of them in 2021s and and now a bunch of them are getting cheap enough that it&#39;s it is getting very interesting so that&#39;s going to be an area of focus next old economy sector stand to benefit most from regulatory laxity materials industrial consumer discretionary we&#39;re positioned for all of those uh growth for materials Tech and healthc care this is earnings growth for next year so materials again we got to pay attention to healthc care biotech Industrials consumer services Etc uh opportunities there goods and services consumption remain depressed but is likely bottoming this is going to be great for for the likes of um the gooses of the world the van the VF corpse of the world Etc including the mag 7 consensus expects just 2.5% volume growth in 2025 against easy comp of just plus five uh. five% in 2024 so there was basically a retail and consumer you know mini recession in 2024 that probably uh troughed in uh this most quarter that&#39;s just been reported and we&#39;ll re accelerate in Q4 I think we&#39;re going to have a solid holiday season and uh a lot of those retailers and consumer discretionary names are going to do better than people expected after a soft Q3 with the weakness into the election uh anticipating and you can see the expected growth moving forward consumer services Health Care uh real estate utilities Etc volume growth since hiking cycle has been negative but demand recovery equals margin expansion we&#39;re seeing that materials Industrials and Tech are expected to drive the biggest margin expansion in 2025 same story the worst of the inventory destocking cycle is likely behind us again for those of you think you missed it it&#39;s just starting we&#39;re kind of at the 2010 level uh and the 2002 level and you had many more years of rally Runway and if you think about it in terms of cars uh its early days of the recovery of volumes semis and Autos saw the biggest decline days sales of inventory year on year by S&amp;P across sectors this is going to reverse easing rate pressure should TR translate into pickup in manufacturing we agree uh mag 7 earnings are expected to slow while other 493 are expected to accelerate we&#39;ve been saying this is coming for the last six months it has come it is going to accelerate through 2025 indicator suggests 14% year on year EPS growth in Q4 versus 9% consensus that&#39;s a big deal we did 5.8% relative to 4.2% in Q3 we&#39;re going to jump in Q4 to uh 14% so selling stocks before the end of the year when no one has a reason to because they don&#39;t want to book the taxes and anticipating great earnings results for Q4 you don&#39;t want to be a seller probably through late January or February if you want to take profits take them then corporate Mis by the way all this is opinion not advice um uh go to hedge fund tips.com click on terms talk to your financial advisor Etc corporate misery index remains weak uh yeah week just like 2001 before biggest move in the shortest amount of time week just like 2009 week just like 1991 week just like 1982 you want to buy when the corporate misery indicator remains weak you don&#39;t want to buy when it&#39;s at the peak necessarily so uh labor productivity we covered that break out domestic investment is picking up after 10 years of under Investments mentions of reshoring increased sharply off the charts construction spent on manufacturing sword in recent years interest rates coming off 5,000 year lows yeah not fivey year 5,000 year lows uh rate cycl can last for four years so people are trying to extrapolate this is going to go up and up and up it&#39;s not going to go up and up and up because uh population in the developed world is is flatlining this is going to remain subdued you get these Spike UPS like in 1895 back when I was only three years old I&#39;m just joking uh and then it spikes back down but in the 18 1800s you saw tons of these uh there was one example here in 1930 to 1968 where it went straight up uh I don&#39;t think you&#39;re going to see a repeat of that because we&#39;ve got too much debt we first need to bring the debt to GDP down which we will we&#39;ll grow our way out of it which Bin&#39;s 3x3 plan let me see if I can remember this uh bring the budget deficit down to 3% um budget deficit three million more barrels of oil and they&#39;re going to bring the budget deficit down through um through the Doge cuts and through other other factors and they want to run real GDP hot which has been the Playbook that I&#39;ve been talking about post World War II why I love bessent because he&#39;s a student of History like I am like we are he understands the postor War II Playbook which I said they&#39;re going to run this Playbook I thought I thought Powell would figure it out Bon&#39;s going to be the guy to do it just like minutian knew the Playbook and they&#39;re going to run inflation and they&#39;re going to run uh nominal growth through the roof the next few years and that debt to GDP is going to start to collapse from 122 to down to uh below 100 and then beyond like from 1948 to 19 uh 56 went it went from 120 down to 63 inflation ran 3 to 5% nominal growth was was high single digits and we&#39;re going to see that type of environment and bessent knows the Playbook so that&#39;s his 3x3 plan perfect pick kudos to the administration for getting that right more than one in three Russell companies is unprofitable they say that like like it&#39;s a bad thing when&#39;s the last time you saw that was in 2010 you wanted to be a buyer of small caps you saw it in 2001 when you had the biggest rally in the shortest amount of time in small caps history and they&#39;re saying that like it&#39;s a bad thing it&#39;s a great thing that&#39;s what you see at the beginning of every small cap cycle uh you number of US Stock shrinking since the late 1990s so there&#39;s no Supply don&#39;t worry Wall Street when the Ducks are cracking Wall Street feeds them you&#39;ll see a ton of IPOs in the next two years forecast predict an 11% kager for electrical demand among data centers nuclear is going to take 10 years to get online where&#39;s all that power going to come from it&#39;s not going to come from solar panels ladies and gentlemen it&#39;s going to come from natural gas com stock resources corporate capex is consistent multiple of fiscal spend and is slated to grow not shrink uh valuations and positioning for Value over growth again once in a generation opportunity haven&#39;t seen since 2001 deep discount on PE to growth that&#39;s the PEG ratio haven&#39;t seen since 2001 this low price to book haven&#39;t seen in decades uh price to sales haven&#39;t been this low since 2001 these are just you get these opportunities once or twice in a career and everyone&#39;s at the wheel you know sleeping and trying to chase the the momo stocks that they&#39;re going to get their faces ripped off and and lose 80% of their money uh accelerating profits growth would historically favor value uh we expect earnings to accelerate in 2025 small cap earnings guidance now above average on a three-month basis same with midcap small caps remain relatively cheap to large caps back to 2001 again midcap same story materials trade below its historical premium again that materials narrative free cash flow yield is yes less compelling than it once was it&#39;s higher it&#39;s still higher it&#39;s still still a better opportunity than it&#39;s been in 25 years um communication Services relative to forward PE versus uh forward PE versus the S&P 500 again not a better opportunity since 2009 and then back to 2001 we uh so there&#39;s opportunity to find in there mag 7even earns expected to slow other 493 accelerate that&#39;s been happening and then macro cycle set to shift from recovery in 2024 to Boom in 2025 that&#39;s from haret one of the best in the business all this cash and money market 6.2 trillion has to put to work and they talk about bubbles over the last 50 years gold in the 70s Japan in the 90s Asia internet in the late 2000s housing in the early two uh late 99 late 1990s for internet housing in the early 2000s China in the mid 2000s biotech in 2014 uh uh Bitcoin came down Arc was a big bubble in 21 Fang and magnificent 7 so there you go ladies and gentlemen that&#39;s a lot of data for a holiday week fed odds we got merging markets we got November 2024 Auto Sale US Auto Sales showing signs of progress thanks to my buddy who sent that over uh basically what they&#39;re saying is November is up to 1 .31 units a growth of 6% from the year ago level that&#39;s with record high interest rates wait till rates continue to come down um credit is is starting to flow and that translates into uh a 15.9 million SAR in November on Trend with the 16 million unit Mark realized in October so remember everyone was pessimistic after September it bounced right back fed Williams sees inflation Cooling and interest rates falling further we like the story on that that&#39;s confirmed by the December uh odds billionaire investor Howard marks is snapping up quote uninvestable Chinese assets legend in the business no one wants it he&#39;s going in and and uh and doing it how I learned to stop worrying about the national debt even though it&#39;s 35 trillion this is an article in the New York Post by Ken Fischer and he goes through all the data and inflation adjustments Etc it&#39;s worth reading um I&#39;m not comfortable with it because I I&#39;m comfortable with it not for the reasons that he lays out but he does lay out good reasons in terms of the the servicing and how they&#39;re going to deal with that uh I&#39;m excited because Bon&#39;s going to run the post World War II Playbook and bring that ratio down bond market Hal halts brutal run as buyers pounce on 4.5% yields us treasuries rally on bets that bessent will soften Trump&#39;s plans that and half the world is off sides on the bond trade this is super important the AI race is entering a new stage Nvidia won&#39;t be the only winner this time okay now why is that important ladies and gentlemen we are see okay at some point ai&#39;s emphasis will shift from training that&#39;s the large language models that take up all that compute power all that energy all the data centers to inference the process of generating answers from results from the model so the models will be built that&#39;s the capital intensive phase many in the industry now believe that dedicating more Computing C power to inference can provide similar benefits to training it&#39;s cheaper less energy different type of chips what we are seeing we are seeing the emergence of a new scaling law with inference time compute nadela said at Microsoft&#39;s ignite conference the inference Focus has big implications for NVIDIA while training is uniquely suited for the company&#39;s gpus inference might be more readily handled by AI processors from Nvidia peers like Advanced Micro Devices and and Intel Intel ladies and gentlemen Intel Intel buy custom chips from Amazon or buy a range of Chip startups um this is huge because you&#39;re going to start to hear more and more from these hyperscalers talking about inference versus training the models training the models Nvidia wins inference Intel wins and this game is just beginning and it&#39;s going to be part driven by cost part driven by energy part driven by efficiency part driven by demands from shareholders for Returns on investments from the hyperscalers and we&#39;re going to move into the inference phase now that a lot of the language the model training is the majority is done there&#39;ll be more model training of course but the inference is where they&#39;re going to get the value for their Investments and Intel is going to be there to service that demand that is just getting started by the way they got their $8 billion from the government which is awesome stimulus rumors as insurance companies told to buy stocks this is China this is from my friend Brendan Ahern over at kweb uh and what he&#39;s saying is the chatter is that the China economic work Council which usually takes place in mid December will will occur in early December with further speculation that the fiscal deficit will be expanded from the 2024&#39;s 3% to 4.5% hopefully the rumors are true one factor that likely contributed significantly was a release from Lee yunzi of the state

hot after Drake is forgotten and um for the US money managers that don&#39;t realize that this the the big game is in Asia on the Canada **Goose** and it will come back to the US with cool stuff like this so this was launched the 26th they&#39;re going to do they did they held back on Advertising the first two um fiscal quarters of the Year 2025 year they don&#39;t operate on a calendar quarter and uh so they&#39;re going to push this into the holiday season I think it&#39;s going to be huge home run right thing at the right time jet pick up the uh advertising spend and they&#39;re going to have a monster quarter so we&#39;ll talk about that in a little bit Trump says Mexico president has agreed to stop migrants Crossing into the us through her country very productive conversation we&#39;ll see how that plays out which means probably less tariffs than advertised China needs 1.4 trillion to boost domestic consumption amid impending trade War 2.0 so I think this is going to be a positive thing it&#39;s going to get maybe at this meeting that Brendan&#39;s talking about maybe it&#39;ll get them to do they did the 1.4 trillion uh in an indirect way they need to do it in a consumer way and maybe we&#39;ll see some of that in coming weeks uh last trump point1 it took till till after January 1st before the inauguration for China to start to take off maybe this time will be a little different rhyming but uh maybe a little bit early we&#39;ll see **Intel** received 7.9 billion in chips sa funding they\n\nhere is the cyclicality of the business this is going to change now that they&#39;re getting into lightwear it&#39;s not going to be so dependent on the fourth quarter cold winter and holiday season but you can see going back to 2016 the story is the same every year uh they they basically do nothing uh up until the third quarter calendar quarter they start to ramp and the fourth quarter they shoot the lights out fourth quarter they shoot the lights out that&#39;s when they generate all the free cash flow and the same will be true this year as we see the spike up cash comes in everyone&#39;s happy and maybe accelerated by the ad spend and the big push of something new uh first time you&#39;re having something big new in the heavy down uh in a while and uh I think they&#39;re going to push this hard and I think it&#39;s going to be well received Haider aurman releases his first snow goose by Canada capsule collection we are going to know a lot more in 60 days if this was the hit they needed to reignite their heavyweight down part of the business I wouldn&#39;t bet against a 67y old brand of this caliber trading at these levels ### MISCELLANEOUS\nCanada Goose was big before Drake and will be big again before Drake is long forgotten in the meantime free cash flow is recovering nicely General market fear in greed&#39;s at 64 uh getting elevated but not yet extreme National Association of Act of invest managers pretty flatlined at 90% up there again not an extreme probably more room to run into end of year S&amp;P earnings basically revisions last 60 days Flatline down 27 basis points Russell same story 55 basis

    "MACRO_DATA_SLIDES": "\n\n### MACRO_DATA_SLIDES\ninitial jobless claims went down that&#39;s good May uh affect odds of a cut in December although it&#39;s been moving around it got down to a coin flip uh before I delete this one sentiment came down on the a aaii sentiment survey uh bullishness came down to 30% 37% bearishness went up so that&#39;s good there&#39;s not Euphoria so I think we can push High and there&#39;s just like who are the natural sellers in a year like this there&#39;s not much tax loss people don&#39;t want to pay the taxes until next year so like expecting a big correction in December just because we&#39;re quote unquote overvalued look at this this must be from the FED minutes these odds dramatically changed a week ago you had 55% odds of a December cut now you&#39;re back up to 70% cut uh chance of a cut in December so that&#39;s really good if they get this cut in uh I think they can be done for a while at least till after March uh they can just wait and see which would be really good because it will cement the idea that they are not a politically based organization that they did two cuts after the election and then they can just wait and wait and wait and maybe they&#39;ll only need one more in 2025 by frontloading them very smart uh and maximum maybe two but uh that&#39;s the perfect mid cycle Playbook like we saw in 1995 another Regional manufacturing ticking up Japan inflation holds above boj Target Fanning December rate hike bets we&#39;ve been talking about this ladies and gentlemen stronger Yen weaker dollar money flows out of Japan back into China this is the theme this is happening in real time natural gas prices turning around like nobody&#39;s business I mean by the way what about Comstock resources like I say we we rarely spend time on the winners but that thing&#39;s up from $9 to $15 in like the last five weeks that&#39;s like a you know 55 50 6 six times about 60% gain uh and we don&#39;t even talk about it but we love that that&#39;s going to continue to work higher intrinsic values a lot higher and uh a few bags from here biggest outflow from healthc care since December 2023 it&#39;s one of the reasons I love Healthcare right now we also saw the exact same thing right after Trump got elected and what outperformed xbi afterwards dollar is expensive we agree going to roll back over re weaken probably related to the cut the hike that&#39;s coming from boj in December globalization to isolationism this is the chart ladies and gentlemen this is what I was referring to with Stuart vanney and um this is absolutely amazing because not only are us duties collected as a percentage of total Imports near 130e lows but they are lower than they were under Clinton under Carter for sure under JFK under all the favorite Democrats had higher duties and tariffs collected as a percentage of total Imports and for those folks saying if we do tariffs the Market&#39;s going to crash just like Holly Smoot go read a history book they put the tariffs on in 1930 and we got a great depression and the stock market crashed 90% well when you burden yourself with the facts you can see that right after the Spanish Flu which is just like we just had covid uh tariffs increased from a many decade low which they bottomed at about 6% and over the next 12 years prior to Holly Smoot the percentage of Duties collected on total Imports Grew From 56% to 20% okay uh Forex 300% increase in tariffs for 12 years before Smoot Holly was announced in 1930 and you got your crash so put it in perspective number one we&#39;re starting from a much lower base and for those of you who don&#39;t know the 20s was one of the greatest booms in history economically speaking uh growth GDP the whole thing new Industries same thing we have it was called The Roaring 20s and we are going to have the Roaring and having the Roaring 2020s so you have a 10-year Runway even if Trump went crazy with tariffs which he won&#39;t because he likes to see the stock market go up um we&#39;ve got 10year Runway and this could go from 3% to probably 15% before we had a massive problem people like well how how can that happen because you&#39;re going to see a lot of massive real and nominal GDP growth over the next four years plus and um so put this chart print it out put it on your wall and for the next two years every time you hear the word Smoot Holly you can Snicker and buy stocks so uh two years in a row isn&#39;t a reason to be bearish when the Market&#39;s up 20% two years in a row uh this is Ryan Dietrich at Carson showing the average return for the next year is 12.3% median 12.8% my favorite chart of all time this is emerging market stocks relative to US Stocks going back and all I can say is again the these are the opportunities where fortunes are generational fortunes are made when you can catch these lows these divergences like you haven&#39;t had since the Reagan error second term of the Reagan error second term of the Trump error when Emerging Markets relative to us markets were as cheap as they are and Bush to in 2001 again two Republican administrations uh and then you also had Carter you had uh Nixon before Carter and you saw this come off the bo come off the lows uh Emerging Markets being the Rock Bottom cheap relative to the US and the big analogy I like to use is 2001 we&#39;re we&#39;re lower than that level and the fortunes that are going to be made by the people that take advantage of this and look we could be wrong and it could take two more years to bottom out but it doesn&#39;t matter when you&#39;re buying with that margin of safety and you&#39;re not on Leverage I&#39;m going to bet we&#39;re there now okay and um and once it gets started it is so it&#39;s unreal it is unreal so there we are consumers are bullish on stocks this was posted um this is from Renaissance macro as a reason to get cautious except for the fact that when you see consumers get bullish on stocks after the these great despondent levels like 2009 like 2011 like 1991 recession that first spike is just the beginning of good things to come when you&#39;re coming off those lows same thing with 2003 beginning of good things to come 2009 2011 and so on so this extreme is is the beginning because you&#39;re coming off such lows it over overshoots on the low end overshoots on the upper end big gains after big gains return tend to be more moderate okay well we saw Ryan stuff that&#39;s actually more empirical this is also interesting during the 2018 to 2019 trade War margins came in below what volume growth implied so what they&#39;re trying to say is because of the trade War margins deteriorated except for the fact that margins were still higher than they were under Clinton in the late 90s and the stock market did well after the midcycle correction in 1995 uh so again coincident versus causal are two different stories and you have to be wary of getting faked out and the secret to not getting faked out in my experience is uh zoom out okay so don&#39;t just look oh well that if margins are going to contract I better get out of stocks because of the trade War if you go back you can see when tariffs were higher on Clinton the market had the biggest growth in the shortest amount of time from the midcycle correction 95 and the FED stepped in did a few cuts and We R even though margins were even lower than they were during the quote unquote trade War so we&#39;re tariffs by the way under under Clinton uh consumer confidence index turning back up Global money market funds elevated that money is going to come back in demographics are tailing to housing demand look how many 33 year olds this is why we&#39;ve been pounding the table un roaring 2020s demographics Drive spending you buy a house you buy a car you buy uh a crib you buy diapers you buy uh stuff to show off in your 30s when you care about that stuff uh buy your 40s you&#39;re already comfortable with what what you&#39;ve accomplished and uh and who you are and then you just do it for the love of the game but um but that drives spending and this is where we are ladies and gentlemen and by the way China&#39;s similar they&#39;re a little bit older but they got you three to five years and by the way for everyone who thinks I&#39;m a China Dove and I love China and all that stuff nothing of the sort let me tell you something I will be twice as pessimistic on China as I am on Japan right now five years from now when their demographics change I just deal with data I don&#39;t care about ideology and narratives and feelings and all that stuff I deal exclusively with data and right now it&#39;s time to buy China and it&#39;s time to buy the US and that&#39;s going to persist for at least 5 to seven years Plus in the US probably it could go as much as 10 years in China I think it&#39;s a fiveyear window we&#39;re going to see massive growth in a short amount of time and then we are going to be out of China and for those who think China is going to be the next great power uh it&#39;s going to be the next great Japan after that last parabolic move go back and look at the Nik index and the demographics of the late 80s for Japan same exact story their toast the one Child Left Behind is going to hit them it&#39;s not going to hit them in the next five years they&#39;re still golden it&#39;s going to hit them after that and they&#39;ll never be able to recover so don&#39;t worry about that us homes are getting smaller I should do more of these podcasts on coffee this is wild this is a theme we&#39;ve been talking about think levit Town we&#39;re going to solve the housing thing under Trump they&#39;re going to build so many small homes it&#39;s going to knock your socks off they&#39;re going to get the zoning uh thing so people can get reson they can build the houses get people in houses raise families rock and roll absorb new new positive immigration which this country makes this country great You&#39; got to have massive immigration you just want to have a a a a um systems in place to make sure you&#39;re not letting in the wrong things and if you look at Trump&#39;s tariff threats all three of them were related to Fentanyl and I think if you know anything about Trump and you read the art of the deal uh or you watch a movie I watched this movie called The Apprentice it was a hitpiece on Trump before the election I didn&#39;t find it to be a hitpiece actually I learned a lot about it watching it and I thought it was pretty useful um but you know they showed how his brother died because he was an alcoholic and I think this is an important issue for Trump uh in that he is so focused on keeping the Fentanyl and JD Vance who grew up in a drug uh I think his mother had drug problems uh keeping that stuff out of this country that Trump&#39;s announcement of China tariffs wasn&#39;t like CH China we&#39;re going to tariff you ideologically because we don&#39;t like you like you know other ideological uh groups had been doing he&#39;s saying you have not kept your word on the death penalty for people pushing fanol into our country through the Mexico and Canada borders therefore we&#39;re going to increase another 10% by the way not 60% another 10% which is a lot less than advertised he also said the same thing to Mexico and he said the same thing to Canada you&#39;re going to keep letting these drugs pour into the country and kill our people in the midwest who are struggling then the hardworking people then you&#39;re 25% tariff 25% tariff all of a sudden the lady got on the phone president of Mexico she said I&#39;m sorry we&#39;re going to we&#39;re going to close it down now it&#39;s not that simple it&#39;s not like a door they can just lock the door but it&#39;s moving them in the right direction Trudeau same story they&#39;ll get it right they&#39;ll come to some accommodation but you know the free lunch is over and uh and I think that&#39;s going to be a great thing for the country in the near term and look for those of you who are not in accordance with that benefit from the ride everything reverts to the mean so it&#39;s going to it it&#39;ll go back to the center in a couple of years maximum four years probably two years but I think it&#39;s going to lay a framework for many many years of growth ahead and jobs and and people that are not in the top 1% and not in the top 5% and not in the top 10% the people that actually build stuff with their hands that have made this country at the amazing country that it is are going to start doing exceptionally well like they did from 20167 to 2019 uh before the the flu came in uh and there&#39;s nothing like it I mean you can just feel the excitement in the air when you&#39;re out there people are you know in in the stock market we call it animal spirits we&#39;re going to see some data on that but just generally people are happy they feel good and I think that&#39;s going to go a long way that confidence ticking back up to uh really having a great great run the next four plus years economically speaking for a lot of people not just a few people for a lot of people and uh Bank of America so they&#39;re looking at GDP uh they&#39;ve taken their estimates up a little bit uh higher for 2025 GDP up to 2.3 I think they&#39;re going to be low there unemployment rate they&#39;ve taken it down from 4.5 to 44 inflation they&#39;ve taken it up okay so they&#39;re kind of that thing but if you actually look at the first Trump Administration inflation actually trended lower you get 3 million barrels excess of energy back on the market from increasing land leases and all that stuff uh that is going to be a big deflationary factor the second thing is if they cut 50% of what they&#39;re talking about at Doge and if you&#39;re betting against VC and elon&#39;s ability to get stuff done uh you&#39;re making a strong mistake I you know I think that especially because it&#39;s going to come down to the Supreme Court and uh I you know I can&#39;t see two trillion but these guys continue especially Elon has continue to surprise us it always takes longer than than he says it&#39;s going to take but he eventually gets it done so uh I don&#39;t know about two trillion that would be deflationary and Trump likes to see the market the stock market go up but a trillion to 500 billion I think is in the bag and that&#39;s deflationary bring inflation down will be offset by some of the stimulatory practices deregulation Etc home equity lines of credit have increased the regredi if that&#39;s a word of the American Consumer is just beginning you&#39;re going to see consumption come back in spades that&#39;s going to help a lot of our consumer discretionary Etc one of which we&#39;re going to talk about today US Stock Market concentration record high that&#39;s going to be changing 75y year high in US Stocks versus rest of the world that&#39;s going to be changing doesn&#39;t mean US Stocks crash means that rest of world starts to outperform in a meaningful way BFA forecasting 124 rate cuts by global central banks in 2025 that could be part of the reason why uh out us uh xus starts to outperform and these are periods as we&#39;ve covered before when you see these plus Century marks of global fed Cuts it&#39;s time to be buyers in the whole not sellers you don&#39;t want to be selling stocks in 2009 with 205 Cuts you don&#39;t want to be selling stocks in uh 2020 Co lows when there&#39;s 162 Global Cuts same thing in 2024 153 plus 154 this may be the most amount of cuts in the shortest period of time in history you want to be a seller of this no you want to be a buyer and you want to be a buyer of international to get the most value for your buck price is what you pay value is what you&#39;re going to get this major Chinese ETF set for record monthly outflows they&#39;re selling in the hole we&#39;re buying in the hole we now have meaningfully more options on Baba than we did before the September Spike where we took off uh I think it was like 80 90% we still have a few of those by the way um at monstrous profits so um I&#39;ve never been more excited and I&#39;m so grateful if you remember when teer went on TV and said buy everything buy everything and uh I&#39;m going over my position limits blah blah blah and um and he said I&#39;m praying that we get a massive pullback here so that I can go way over my position limits and buy way more than I&#39;ve already bought and Baba is his number one position by the way uh and what now that we got that pullback okay and this week everyone was under the table round trip okay we were buying and I&#39;m sure terer was also buying in the hole and you&#39;re going to over the next 12 months what happens after the inauguration we&#39;re very excited about that I mean I was so excited to see what happened in September October and so grateful for that uh it just went parabolic we had to hit the window on the options we didn&#39;t sell a share of stock by the way so yeah we you know so uh but I didn&#39;t think we&#39;d get an opportunity to extend out and to get this type of exposure in the hole it&#39;s super duper exciting uh pce prices going down moving in the right direction continuing job jobless claims moving up that is probably what got the um maybe I should switch to water too much energy here uh that is probably what got the FED odds back up to 70% which is huge four-week average coming down of the jobless claims Services PMI continue to climb that&#39;s massive expansion just like you see off major lows uh consumer sentiment index turning up last month or so turning up household consumption consensus forecast turning up since the election Japan department store sales collapsing below the zero line everyone piled into Japan last year they&#39;re getting taken out to the Woodshed that doesn&#39;t preclude buying cheap Japanese companies that do most of their business abroad there are opportunities there and smart people know where to find them but um chasing the crowd after the move is not the way to go net bullish opened option strategies so you&#39;re seeing this uh but that&#39;s just at the nent early stages of animal spirits biggest outflow in the past two week from treasuries again exact wrong time when did you see that late 2018 before the biggest rally in bonds top five offered payment methods in the global eCommerce market last year well

breaking out to all-time highs couldn&#39;t give it away last year we kept pounding the table everything thing everyone said shut up with your small caps already there were two guys talking small caps three guys uh Tom Hayes Ryan Dietrich and Tom Lee in big ways everyone gave Tom Lee a lot of you know what because they didn&#39;t go up 50% in 5 minutes so it&#39;s taking a year and a half uh maybe 18 months and uh and now people are like oh yeah that that makes sense uh midcaps versus large caps just starting to turn the corner this is a proxy for small cap relative value as well uh and that huge opportunity last time we saw was in 2020 it&#39;s happening all over again small cat uh us S&amp;P price index um who is this Deutsche Bank is saying it&#39;s going to get to 7,000 by the end of next year I think that&#39;s a little optimistic I think that takes two years or a year and a half at least uh then you&#39;ve got S&amp;P 500 sector groups earnings growth for next year forecast so they&#39;re seeing huge earnings growth in uh in materials we&#39;ve got album Mar we got to get more materials exposure if we can find some maybe some in the a space those are so cyclical but they might get interesting you also saw Carl icon do that uh here&#39;s the 10year rolling over as we had anticipated it&#39;ll be fits and starts but that&#39;s the direction of path fomc men mentions of restrictive or related words and phrases collapsing so but they are still restrictive they do have to come down probably a couple of cuts more to be in neutral territory but they don&#39;t have to come down six more that&#39;s for sure three is a terminal 3% terminal rate is not going to happen consumer conference board confidence just spiked up in the last month consumer expectations spiked up in the last few months consumer board one-year inflation expectations still going down Advanced decline this is the S&P 500 shows how breath is improving midcaps breaking out Advanced decline small caps breaking out Advanced decline cap growth going up uh options Traders Target higher US Treasury yields this is the perfect example of the crowd being doing the exact wrong thing at the exact wrong time so just as 10-year yield Trump got elected 10 year yield went up to 4.4 and change what did they do like Lemmings they all went out and bought options on 465 485 and these are all the macro funds all you know they just because they wear ties and have fancy credentials doesn&#39;t mean they&#39;re not Lemmings and they don&#39;t crowd into the wrong things at the wrong time and uh and that&#39;s exactly what happened here so what&#39;s going to happen all of this premium is going to evaporate and the Schmucks who bought it are going to be left with goose egg and the Geniuses who sold it are going to M mint money and uh and that&#39;s the way the game works rolling four-year average flows positive the last two weeks this is net buys of us equities uh uh they&#39;ve been selling all year long while the indices have gone up and now they&#39;re playing the catch-up trade into year end Average stock trades as a wide discount to the index this is where the fortunes are going to be made ladies and gentlemen in the next year uh in the uh Average stock valuation relative to the S&P is so inexpensive and we didn&#39;t haven&#39;t seen this since 2001 which has been a template for what we&#39;re talking about in in coming years top seven S&P companies account for 30% of The Benchmark that is going to change uh Peak growth priced in for the Magnificent 7 you haven&#39;t seen this level of extreme since two late 2021 before the mag 7 dramatically underperformed in 2022 and a lot of people got smoke chasing at the end of 2021 when they didn&#39;t want to buy in 2020 I&#39;m not saying mag 7 is going to crash I am saying they are are going to underperform over the next two years uh no and they have been for the last six months by the way um valuations currently suggests 0 to 1% per anom price returns over the next decade I love this this is so beautiful ladies and gentlemen because they&#39;re basically saying all the gains for the next decade are gone you&#39;re going to get no gains from S&P and you see this lost decade every few years the uh I&#39;m not even G to point out but just Google lost decade and you&#39;ll see all the people from uh the lows in 2009 who have been saying it for the last 15 years and uh they used to manage trillions of dollars of money and these guys were just getting it wrong for a decade and we haven&#39;t been this low in terms of expectations the secret to happiness is low expectations since when since 2001 and you had the biggest growth in the shortest amount of time in emerging market stocks when expectations for US Stocks were at zero for the next 10 years and that&#39;s exactly where we are now and people are using this as a reason to say get out of stocks at the exact wrong time uh and you wanted to be getting into stocks in 2001 not only us to a lesser extent but to a larger extent xus Emerging Markets lower financial leverage than the 1990s and 2000s so healthy balance sheets higher quality composition than prior decades more asset light so you it warrants higher multiples as the point they&#39;re making economic data surprises have turned more positive we covered the margin issue m&amp;a tracking above 2022 and 2023 levels uh that&#39;s going to persist the question is how much of it&#39;s priced into the big Banks which is why we took profits on City over the summer which basically has done nothing since um so if we get some type of pullback scare which usually you do in February people start taking gains um and raising cash for taxes and all that stuff so February you usually get weakness in the market maybe we&#39;ll have an opportunity to re-enter some of the bigger Banks then typically IPOs outperform in both the short medium and long term uh so you see the first few months they do well and by so there&#39;s an opportunity to look at IPOs that are three years old and left for dead there were a ton of them in 2021s and and now a bunch of them are getting cheap enough that it&#39;s it is getting very interesting so that&#39;s going to be an area of focus next old economy sector stand to benefit most from regulatory laxity materials industrial consumer discretionary we&#39;re positioned for all of those uh growth for materials Tech and healthc care this is earnings growth for next year so materials again we got to pay attention to healthc care biotech Industrials consumer services Etc uh opportunities there goods and services consumption remain depressed but is likely bottoming this is going to be great for for the likes of um the gooses of the world the van the VF corpse of the world Etc including the mag 7 consensus expects just 2.5% volume growth in 2025 against easy comp of just plus five uh. five% in 2024 so there was basically a retail and consumer you know mini recession in 2024 that probably uh troughed in uh this most quarter that&#39;s just been reported and we&#39;ll re accelerate in Q4 I think we&#39;re going to have a solid holiday season and uh a lot of those retailers and consumer discretionary names are going to do better than people expected after a soft Q3 with the weakness into the election uh anticipating and you can see the expected growth moving forward consumer services Health Care uh real estate utilities Etc volume growth since hiking cycle has been negative but demand recovery equals margin expansion we&#39;re seeing that materials Industrials and Tech are expected to drive the biggest margin expansion in 2025 same story the worst of the inventory destocking cycle is likely behind us again for those of you think you missed it it&#39;s just starting we&#39;re kind of at the 2010 level uh and the 2002 level and you had many more years of rally Runway and if you think about it in terms of cars uh its early days of the recovery of volumes semis and Autos saw the biggest decline days sales of inventory year on year by S&amp;P across sectors this is going to reverse easing rate pressure should TR translate into pickup in manufacturing we agree uh mag 7 earnings are expected to slow while other 493 are expected to accelerate we&#39;ve been saying this is coming for the last six months it has come it is going to accelerate through 2025 indicator suggests 14% year on year EPS growth in Q4 versus 9% consensus that&#39;s a big deal we did 5.8% relative to 4.2% in Q3 we&#39;re going to jump in Q4 to uh 14% so selling stocks before the end of the year when no one has a reason to because they don&#39;t want to book the taxes and anticipating great earnings results for Q4 you don&#39;t want to be a seller probably through late January or February if you want to take profits take them then corporate Mis by the way all this is opinion not advice um uh go to hedge fund tips.com click on terms talk to your financial advisor Etc corporate misery index remains weak uh yeah week just like 2001 before biggest move in the shortest amount of time week just like 2009 week just like 1991 week just like 1982 you want to buy when the corporate misery indicator remains weak you don&#39;t want to buy when it&#39;s at the peak necessarily so uh labor productivity we covered that break out domestic investment is picking up after 10 years of under Investments mentions of reshoring increased sharply off the charts construction spent on manufacturing sword in recent years interest rates coming off 5,000 year lows yeah not fivey year 5,000 year lows uh rate cycl can last for four years so people are trying to extrapolate this is going to go up and up and up it&#39;s not going to go up and up and up because uh population in the developed world is is flatlining this is going to remain subdued you get these Spike UPS like in 1895 back when I was only three years old I&#39;m just joking uh and then it spikes back down but in the 18 1800s you saw tons of these uh there was one example here in 1930 to 1968 where it went straight up uh I don&#39;t think you&#39;re going to see a repeat of that because we&#39;ve got too much debt we first need to bring the debt to GDP down which we will we&#39;ll grow our way out of it which Bin&#39;s 3x3 plan let me see if I can remember this uh bring the budget deficit down to 3% um budget deficit three million more barrels of oil and they&#39;re going to bring the budget deficit down through um through the Doge cuts and through other other factors and they want to run real GDP hot which has been the Playbook that I&#39;ve been talking about post World War II why I love bessent because he&#39;s a student of History like I am like we are he understands the postor War II Playbook which I said they&#39;re going to run this Playbook I thought I thought Powell would figure it out Bon&#39;s going to be the guy to do it just like minutian knew the Playbook and they&#39;re going to run inflation and they&#39;re going to run uh nominal growth through the roof the next few years and that debt to GDP is going to start to collapse from 122 to down to uh below 100 and then beyond like from 1948 to 19 uh 56 went it went from 120 down to 63 inflation ran 3 to 5% nominal growth was was high single digits and we&#39;re going to see that type of environment and bessent knows the Playbook so that&#39;s his 3x3 plan perfect pick kudos to the administration for getting that right more than one in three Russell companies is unprofitable they say that like like it&#39;s a bad thing when&#39;s the last time you saw that was in 2010 you wanted to be a buyer of small caps you saw it in 2001 when you had the biggest rally in the shortest amount of time in small caps history and they&#39;re saying that like it&#39;s a bad thing it&#39;s a great thing that&#39;s what you see at the beginning of every small cap cycle uh you number of US Stock shrinking since the late 1990s so there&#39;s no Supply don&#39;t worry Wall Street when the Ducks are cracking Wall Street feeds them you&#39;ll see a ton of IPOs in the next two years forecast predict an 11% kager for electrical demand among data centers nuclear is going to take 10 years to get online where&#39;s all that power going to come from it&#39;s not going to come from solar panels ladies and gentlemen it&#39;s going to come from natural gas com stock resources corporate capex is consistent multiple of fiscal spend and is slated to grow not shrink uh valuations and positioning for Value over growth again once in a generation opportunity haven&#39;t seen since 2001 deep discount on PE to growth that&#39;s the PEG ratio haven&#39;t seen since 2001 this low price to book haven&#39;t seen in decades uh price to sales haven&#39;t been this low since 2001 these are just you get these opportunities once or twice in a career and everyone&#39;s at the wheel you know sleeping and trying to chase the the momo stocks that they&#39;re going to get their faces ripped off and and lose 80% of their money uh accelerating profits growth would historically favor value uh we expect earnings to accelerate in 2025 small cap earnings guidance now above average on a three-month basis same with midcap small caps remain relatively cheap to large caps back to 2001 again midcap same story materials trade below its historical premium again that materials narrative free cash flow yield is yes less compelling than it once was it&#39;s higher it&#39;s still higher it&#39;s still still a better opportunity than it&#39;s been in 25 years um communication Services relative to forward PE versus uh forward PE versus the S&P 500 again not a better opportunity since 2009 and then back to 2001 we uh so there&#39;s opportunity to find in there mag 7even earns expected to slow other 493 accelerate that&#39;s been happening and then macro cycle set to shift from recovery in 2024 to Boom in 2025 that&#39;s from haret one of the best in the business all this cash and money market 6.2 trillion has to put to work and they talk about bubbles over the last 50 years gold in the 70s Japan in the 90s Asia internet in the late 2000s housing in the early two uh late 99 late 1990s for internet housing in the early 2000s China in the mid 2000s biotech in 2014 uh uh Bitcoin came down Arc was a big bubble in 21 Fang and magnificent 7 so there you go ladies and gentlemen that&#39;s a lot of data for a holiday week fed odds we got merging markets we got November 2024 Auto Sale US Auto Sales showing signs of progress thanks to my buddy who sent that over uh basically what they&#39;re saying is November is up to 1 .31 units a growth of 6% from the year ago level that&#39;s with record high interest rates wait till rates continue to come down um credit is is starting to flow and that translates into uh a 15.9 million SAR in November on Trend with the 16 million unit Mark realized in October so remember everyone was pessimistic after September it bounced right back fed Williams sees inflation Cooling and interest rates falling further we like the story on that that&#39;s confirmed by the December uh odds billionaire investor Howard marks is snapping up quote uninvestable Chinese assets legend in the business no one wants it he&#39;s going in and and uh and doing it how I learned to stop worrying about the national debt even though it&#39;s 35 trillion this is an article in the New York Post by Ken Fischer and he goes through all the data and inflation adjustments Etc it&#39;s worth reading um I&#39;m not comfortable with it because I I&#39;m comfortable with it not for the reasons that he lays out but he does lay out good reasons in terms of the the servicing and how they&#39;re going to deal with that uh I&#39;m excited because Bon&#39;s going to run the post World War II Playbook and bring that ratio down bond market Hal halts brutal run as buyers pounce on 4.5% yields us treasuries rally on bets that bessent will soften Trump&#39;s plans that and half the world is off sides on the bond trade this is super important the AI race is entering a new stage Nvidia won&#39;t be the only winner this time okay now why is that important ladies and gentlemen we are see okay at some point ai&#39;s emphasis will shift from training that&#39;s the large language models that take up all that compute power all that energy all the data centers to inference the process of generating answers from results from the model so the models will be built that&#39;s the capital intensive phase many in the industry now believe that dedicating more Computing C power to inference can provide similar benefits to training it&#39;s cheaper less energy different type of chips what we are seeing we are seeing the emergence of a new scaling law with inference time compute nadela said at Microsoft&#39;s ignite conference the inference Focus has big implications for NVIDIA while training is uniquely suited for the company&#39;s gpus inference might be more readily handled by AI processors from Nvidia peers like Advanced Micro Devices and and Intel Intel ladies and gentlemen Intel Intel buy custom chips from Amazon or buy a range of Chip startups um this is huge because you&#39;re going to start to hear more and more from these hyperscalers talking about inference versus training the models training the models Nvidia wins inference Intel wins and this game is just beginning and it&#39;s going to be part driven by cost part driven by energy part driven by efficiency part driven by demands from shareholders for Returns on investments from the hyperscalers and we&#39;re going to move into the inference phase now that a lot of the language the model training is the majority is done there&#39;ll be more model training of course but the inference is where they&#39;re going to get the value for their Investments and Intel is going to be there to service that demand that is just getting started by the way they got their $8 billion from the government which is awesome stimulus rumors as insurance companies told to buy stocks this is China this is from my friend Brendan Ahern over at kweb uh and what he&#39;s saying is the chatter is that the China economic work Council which usually takes place in mid December will will occur in early December with further speculation that the fiscal deficit will be expanded from the 2024&#39;s 3% to 4.5% hopefully the rumors are true one factor that likely contributed significantly was a release from Lee yunzi of the state Administration for financial regulation stating that the insurance industry should quote increase investment in areas such as strategic emerging Industries Advanced manufacturing and new infrastructure as an FYI you will only read about this here uh this would explain why the mainland&#39;s pure technology play the starboard gained 3.61% versus the partial technology shenzhen&#39;s gain of 2.07% and the technology light shanghai&#39;s gain of 1.53% insurance companies putting money to work would help stem the stock market&#39;s recent slide after ripping post stimulus announcement remember L Hefe said the stock Market is higher through Mainland margin balances have fallen significantly insurance companies are being told to buy stock to buy the stock market would help interestingly the national team&#39;s favored ETF had below average volumes again so this is from Brandon aharn giving us the inside

going to get the value for their Investments and **Intel** is going to be there to service that demand that is just getting started by the way they got their $8 billion from the government which is awesome stimulus rumors as insurance companies told to buy stocks this is China this is from my friend Brendan Ahern over at kweb uh and what he&#39;s saying is the chatter is that the China economic work Council which usually takes place in mid December will will occur in early December with further speculation that the fiscal deficit will be expanded from the 2024&#39;s 3% to 4.5% hopefully the rumors are true one factor that likely contributed significantly was a release from Lee yunzi of the state Administration for financial regulation stating that the insurance industry should quote increase investment in areas such as strategic emerging Industries Advanced manufacturing and new infrastructure as an FYI you will only read about this here uh this would explain why the mainland&#39;s pure technology play the starboard gained 3.61% versus the partial technology shenzhen&#39;s gain of 2.07% and the technology light shanghai&#39;s gain of 1.53% insurance companies putting money to work would help stem the stock market&#39;s recent slide after ripping post stimulus announcement remember L Hefe said the stock Market is higher through Mainland margin balances have fallen significantly insurance companies are being told to buy stock to buy the stock market would help interestingly the national team&#39;s favored ETF had below average volumes again so this is from Brandon aharn giving us the inside scoop which is why we read him every day and uh great work there\n\n### MISCELLANEOUS\nCanada **Goose** has been around since 1957 it was hot before Drake was

they&#39;re going to have a monster quarter so we&#39;ll talk about that in a little bit Trump says Mexico president has agreed to stop migrants Crossing into the us through her country very productive conversation we&#39;ll see how that plays out which means probably less tariffs than advertised China needs 1.4 trillion to boost domestic consumption amid impending trade War 2.0 so I think this is going to be a positive thing it&#39;s going to get maybe at this meeting that Brendan&#39;s talking about maybe it&#39;ll get them to do they did the 1.4 trillion uh in an indirect way they need to do it in a consumer way and maybe we&#39;ll see some of that in coming weeks uh last trump point1 it took till till after January 1st before the inauguration for China to start to take

growth story that turned into a value story when we initiated and has a chance to turn back into a growth story if they execute on their plan and catch a little Tailwind in the Asia recovery as well as cyclicality they&#39;ve been through these Cycles many year many times since they started in 1957 so while it is still a small position for us I&#39;m looking for Windows that will make sense to upssize it into a full-size holding as the data confirms the original Outlook and thesis we&#39;ve been modestly topping up on weakness but have yet to lean in with a cannon so far we may never do it but I think uh we&#39;ll be paying close attention to opportunities as the data comes in so 10 key points from Canada Goose November 7th earnings results and call first off Revenue uh 192 million beat Expectations by 7.86 despite a 4.9% year-over-year decline uh EPS estimate beat estimates a company expanded its permanent store count to 72 locations if you remember from the long-term plan was to grow the DTC and reduce the wholesale inventory levels decreased by 9% uh net debt was decreased by about 25 million spring and summer collection was well received indicating potential for a robust annual lineup not just the heavy down lines e-commerce traffic increase suggesting growing online interest in the brand companies broadening its product range with plans to launch an eyewear line uh positive Trends have been observed in the Chinese market particularly during events like golden week and singles day the company&#39;s focusing on expanding the non- heavyweight down categories and diversifying into non-seasonal app Parable which could lead to yearr round Revenue opportunities the Cornerstone in other words the business is very cyclical I&#39;m going to show you the data and you&#39;ll see cornerstones of the turnaround plan are twofold reduce the wholesale and two make up the difference with broader product off offering and more DTC stores and high margin opportunities the expected long-term benefits of the DTC plan for Canada Goose include higher profit margins by eliminating intermediaries Canada Goose can capture a larger sale of the retail price leading to improved profitability over time enhanced brand control the DTC model allows Canada Goose to take greater control of its brand narrative and product distribution improve consumer engagement reduced wholesale presence allows for dependency less dependency on markdowns often seen in wholesale partners ship better Inventory management the shift to DDC enables more efficient inventory control as evidenced by the 9% decrease in inventory levels valuable consumer insights direct interaction with customers provides data that can inform product development and marketing strategies increased operational efficiency as Canada Goose optimizes DTC operations it may benefit from economies to scale in retail and e-commerce channels Global expansion opportunities the DTC model facilitates easier entry into new markets particular Ally through e-commerce enhanc customer lifetime value a strong DTC presence can potentially increase brand loyalty and customer retention agility and product offering direct sales allow for quicker adaptation to market trends and consumer preferences price is what you pay value is what you get while free cash flow has materially recovered price has remained subdued I built my career on capturing divergences like this and you can see free cash flow trailing 12 months accelerating when that happens historically what happens the price follows recovery in cash flow price follows recovery and cash flow price not following yet and will follow revenues continue to climb return on invested capital is still high single digits despite that we are in a trough recovery cycle destocking turning into restocking as the inventory management under control with reducing wholesalers gross margin still at 68% which is an unbelievable business and uh and then I want to get into more granular numbers and as I like to as I say on this uh article this is the Farah facet of financial pictures in my view in that the sales per share continue to go up the cash flow per share continues to go up the earnings per share continue to go up the sales continue to go up the operating margin what the only thing that has gone down is the price and we believe that that will start to play catchup look it&#39;s not all peaches and cream revenues were down 4% year on year but this is a cyclical enough business that you have to accept and trust that they will figure it out as they&#39;ve done since 1957 anytime you find yourself in a situation where the financials continue to recover and improve and the price continues to decline count your lucky blessings

Happy Thanksgiving enjoy the football fun and family and here we go llan llan Neo Tom is this is more of a career question is the CFA useful to break into Finance how does one get into value investing career like yourself um yeah I think if you don&#39;t have any experience that&#39;s table Stakes so go get your CFA and if you&#39;re doing it to get a job save yourself time uh if you&#39;re doing it because you love it and you want to learn as much as possible as an investment in your future I would highly recommend that um next Eric first of all thanks for the amazing content you&#39;re putting out I can&#39;t find another podcast that even comes close as for the question of the week this is from sampy commas I okay um I know these are too large for you but Google and lvmh seem to me to be undervalued here valuations look good to me uh good cash flowing businesses with Good Financial Health that can perform great would love to hear your thoughts in any case thanks for so much for all the content you&#39;re putting out all right sampy thank you for writing in um you&#39;re probably newer so um you don&#39;t know our Google history but we were massive buyers of Google in the whole in late 2022 and early 2023 when no one wanted it in the 80s and 90s and we took profits this summer uh with more than a double bag in that and now that&#39;s you know up here everyone&#39;s getting interested uh I&#39;m not going to argue with you on that but uh you know we have to book wins and we were happy to book it and we have no urgency to get back in especially when we&#39;re using chat GPT and perplexity and uh meta AI uh a lot more than we have been in um recent years so I think Google will be fine I just don&#39;t think I think the opportunity would to buy it was when no one wanted it not when everyone wanted it as it relates to lvmh I think you&#39;re spot on but we have enough um consumer exposure and China exposure which this is basically just a play on the China recovery which we have through goose and Baba so um let&#39;s just take a look at here the financials all right so cash flow dropped it&#39;s recovering revenues gross margins same as goose 68% turn invested Capital so the stock&#39;s down about 40% I mean this is such a super high quality business that um I think you&#39;re going to be super right um but I think you might be a little bit early so yeah I I think you&#39;re probably okay with this I mean I think there are higher better uses for us but um I don&#39;t think you&#39;re wrong here I just think you got to wait a little longer than you think I I like that one better than Google to be honest with you um but not enough to get involved all right that&#39;s that Julian Julian Glock I see an increasing amount of people I follow expecting not only a pullback but rather a crash in q1 or Q2 of 2025 as markets seem stretched melting up to them now I was of course wondering about your take on this and if it should come to that whether you would hold long-term positions through such times or are there moments when you would go entirely to cash uh okay good question number one is the people calling for crashes are the ones that missed the rally number two I do expect a pullback in the first quarter probably 8 to 10% probably around February completely guessing and because of that no we would not sell any of our long-term positions uh unless they were at or fully invalu irrespective of our guess about when the next correction is going to come I don&#39;t believe it&#39;ll be a crash I don&#39;t believe it&#39;ll be 20% I do think we&#39;re due for an 8 to 10% pullback and I don&#39;t think it&#39;s going to come until at least uh Late July January early February at the earliest uh or mid you know late late January February at the earliest and the way that we will potentially participate in that is we&#39;ll use part of our options bucket to hedge or fine tactical shorts in the short term and the only benefit of that is just dampening volatility and creating some excess cash to go long um but um no we don&#39;t we don&#39;t guess about when the Market&#39;s going to pull back and try to be nimble and and silly about that because going back to Peter Lynch&#39;s more money has been lost preparing for Corrections than the actual Corrections themselves number two we don&#39;t run High leverage so we just deal through the volatility it&#39;s like would you sell your jersey mics uh if you own 20 Jersey mics uh stores and you know some Economist said there was going to be a you know 20% pullback in the stock market therefore people are going to have less money to buy sandwiches or less consumer confidence so for the next six months sales are going to be down sell all your your franchises in the whole at low price no you would say if you&#39;re smart and you want to get rich you would say oh I wonder if any of my competitors are going to sell at lower multiples in the next six months when sales go down so I can have 40 stores instead of 10 stores and buy up those opportunities because when it comes back I&#39;ll make even more money that&#39;s the way to think about it not going to cash and all this nonsense and and pretending to predict the markets so uh hope that helps and um good question ad guard after the latest meltdown do you think target can be a good entry

here's one for your Emerging Markets banko Colombia is a well-run bank paying 10.4% dividends like Argentina there is  an uplift if there's a change in government CIB I'm told is the best bank in Columbia Pete okay Pete well thanks for that I don't think there's a question there um I don't bet on potential changes in government and I don't tend to trust double digigit uh dividends staying intact it may prove to be correct but just taking a brief look this is already had a big run off the bottom uh it's a little late for my liking Greg altimari uh thanks for your input on oxy please take a look at di diio we own diio we like it it's going to be a bit of a track turnaround uh this is a new position for us we're not writing about it yet again this has China exposure this is going to benefit from Emerging Markets it did the exact same thing in when 2001 um so this is the best quality business yeah glp 1's have an impact but really this is a turnaround China recovery play and just looking at the numbers you can see that the stock price has overshot the deterioration in the financials they had a lot of pull forward during uh covid in terms of demand and now they're working through that and they had some issues in South America so prices come down with free cash flow revenues have been flat they need to re accelerate margins are holding up uh return on invested capital is solid continues to be double digits so this is just a waiting game it's the best game in town if you want to bet people will never drink again then you should get short the stock in the hole if you want to say people with you know people continue to like to escape you know I always tell my the one thing I like about what Trump did with his kids is no drinking no drugs no alcohol no tattoos there's nothing wrong with any of those stuff things in moderation I guess um uh but um the fact of the matter is since the beginning of time people have wanted to escape from reality and alcohol is one way they do it and glp ones or not glp ones I think they're still going to want to do it and I think diio is going to provide for that service so is it the investment that I'm the most proud of in my life no uh but again I don't deal in ideology I deal in numbers and the fact is there's a demand in the marketplace for this there's going to be a continued demand there's a growing new middle class in emerging market that is growing like a weed that is going to get involved in this space and they're going to have celebrations and they're going to have social Gatherings and they're going to have uh even if they're drinking less they're going to be more people drinking and diio is positioned to benefit from that so uh let people be happy the way they want to be happy and uh and we'll be happy uh taking it all the way to the banks so uh we like diio and good one there and we own it uh n n deep basine thanks for everything you and your podcast have been a blessing uh for your restaurant play could the ticket Yelp qualify Tech play to cover overall eatout dollars rising over the next four years kind of off the- wall but love to hear your thoughts you thankfully butchered my last beyond meat suggestion exactly uh there we go um all right thanks Nate happy to do this one let's do Yelp this is a trading vehicle this has been a crap business that continues to trade in a Range let's see if anything is changed in the numbers that can change our mind um all right cash flows going up or had gone up price gone up revenues went up turn on Capital margins are down uh this is a tricky one my friend I'd have to understand what the turnaround plan is and why it's sustainable why are the numbers modestly improving uh did they buy something did they consolidate the industry how's the balance sheet balance Sheet's great yeah the good news is you're probably right the bad news is it's probably only going to be a cyclical uh short-term trade uh back up to 50 but uh I hope I'm wrong about that I think you got a good uh trade uh I don't think you have a good long-term business let's move to Jimbo uh all right so he's saying know I like your buy of etsy at $48 uh what's your Target price uh we're not going to publish that that's for our current because then people are going to try to front run our exit but I can tell you this that we don't get involved in any stock that we don't anticipate a double inside of three years uh and um some of them are have much more than a double and then when you add our options overlays they all have more than that uh so I would say no less than a double in three years and uh and on most of them a lot more and then certainly a lot more when you add in the option overlay so we'll leave it at that um Matt tumbo says I've been
