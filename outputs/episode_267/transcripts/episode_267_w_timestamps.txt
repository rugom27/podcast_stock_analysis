[0.799s] welcome to hedge fun tips with Tom Hayes
[3.56s] I&#39;m Tom Hayes and this is your
[6.56s] 267th videoast podcast for the week
[9.32s] ending November 28 2024 Happy
[13.24s] Thanksgiving everyone very very grateful
[17.199s] uh for your consistent support and uh
[20.56s] all the amazing stuff we&#39;ve gone through
[22.56s] together over the years uh and I&#39;m going
[25.32s] to make this one much better than I
[27.519s] expected the secret to happiness is low
[29.64s] expect ations I was shocked the amount
[32.2s] of data out there this week so as much
[35.0s] as I thought this would be a 30 minute
[36.96s] deal this is going to probably be a
[38.6s] little bit longer and a lot more value
[41.16s] uh and that&#39;s what we try to do each and
[42.6s] every week so uh as always family
[45.68s] first uh this is Mimi and Annabelle uh
[49.879s] they got this amazing Spanish Water Polo
[52.48s] stuff from Annie espar she won a gold
[55.359s] medal uh in water polo in the Paris
[58.559s] Olympics in 20 24 for Spain so these are
[62.12s] the type of folks they&#39;re training with
[64.239s] in California super exciting and uh very
[68.52s] kind of Annie these pictures here the
[71.56s] girls heard about this amazing teacher
[73.68s] who was trying to raise money and get
[75.119s] help for friends giving for her students
[77.6s] who may not get a Thanksgiving so they
[80.88s] took it on their own initiative to help
[82.88s] make it happen here are some photos of
[85.32s] the kids uh this one we&#39;ll get to in a
[87.759s] second these are not the kids these are

[110.719s] raspberries they hesitated to take one
[112.96s] because they didn&#39;t know what it was but
[115.24s] I told them to try it and they loved it
[117.24s] and they also had freshly made juice
[119.36s] with Italian parsley lime juice chia
[121.6s] seeds and monk fruit sugar also they
[123.68s] learned how to make spring rolls without

[358.08s] that to the girls as well super amazing
[360.919s] lady this was us in front of the
[362.6s] Christmas tree at Fox this was probably
[364.639s] the most fun day of my entire year being
[367.08s] in the city with the girls this is
[368.759s] Bryant Park uh right next to our place
[371.84s] there that&#39;s the ice rink that&#39;s
[374.319s] Annabelle and the tree and uh Bryant
[378.12s] Park Hotel right over there and then
[380.639s] Bryant Park Grill right across the
[382.52s] street and we got to sit next to the
[384.24s] Christmas tree I mean there&#39;s nothing
[386.28s] like New York City at Christmas time
[389.039s] what an amazing couple of days we had
[391.68s] there uh and then uh as as it as it goes
[395.599s] let&#39;s get down to the media here uh we
[398.72s] talked about some very important things
[400.199s] because overnight uh before getting on
[402.599s] with
[403.759s] Stewart uh president-elect Trump
[406.96s] announced that he was going to tariff uh
[409.56s] Mexico and Canada and China and I think
[413.599s] it&#39;s important here to listen in and
[416.72s] separate the facts from the p ception of
[420.16s] the facts and we got a chance to go into
[422.56s] that with Stu so let&#39;s listen in here
[425.199s] with me now is uh I&#39;ll check the markets
[427.56s] first of all please uh Split Decision
[429.68s] here Dow&#39;s down 218 and the NASDAQ is up
[433.8s] 109 points with me now is great Hill
[436.56s] Capital chairman Thomas Hayes Trump
[439.16s] wants to impose a 25% tariff on Canada
[441.919s] and Mexico and to just to stem the flow
[444.599s] of drugs and migrants across the border
[446.8s] how come this major tariffs he&#39;s
[449.0s] proposing here yeah how come the
[450.639s] Market&#39;s not selling off well I think
[452.8s] two things number one it looks like not
[454.72s] only Mexico but also Canada is going to
[456.72s] pay for that wall is is happening I
[458.599s] think look Canada&#39;s had a free ride all
[460.36s] the people that we&#39;ve rejected from
[461.68s] coming in go through Canada it&#39;s like a
[463.319s] Civ so this is his ask this is the
[465.56s] starting point it&#39;ll come down if you
[467.24s] look at the China tariffs overnight he
[468.759s] said 10% more but there was a caveat
[471.479s] because you&#39;re not imposing the death
[473.52s] penalty on fentanyl Smugglers we are
[476.28s] putting this 10% tarff that&#39;s a lot
[478.0s] lower than advertised during the
[479.68s] campaign isn&#39;t it so China&#39;s stocks were
[482.08s] up overnight on that it&#39;s more moderate
[484.599s] and I think this whole fear about
[486.8s] tariffs do we are at the lowest tariffs
[489.72s] in more than a century okay we had
[492.08s] higher tariffs uh under Clinton under
[494.759s] Carter than we have under Trump 2 to 3%
[497.28s] of All Imports we have duties on they
[499.52s] had four or 5% under under Carter and
[502.28s] under Clinton and going back to 1918
[505.08s] everyone says oh tariffs holy Smoot this
[507.24s] is going to be a huge problem he&#39;s going
[508.4s] to put tariffs and we&#39;re going to crash
[510.199s] tariffs in 1980 right after the Spanish
[512.2s] Flu were 5% of all they grew for over a
[516.039s] decade to 20% before Holly Smoot so
[519.399s] there was a decade of increasing tariffs
[521.8s] with a huge economy with a growing
[523.519s] economy before Holly Smoot so this is a
[526.2s] complete misnomer of history that the
[527.959s] minute you put any tariffs on the market
[530.08s] crashes you have a 10year Runway at
[533.88s] least and we&#39;re starting at a much lower
[535.68s] base than we did in 1918 you brought
[537.6s] some stock picks with you I want to
[539.079s] concentr right in just one and that&#39;s
[540.72s] gener yes um I I have a gener generator
[544.92s] and I kind of like this thing oh no
[546.88s] question about it everyone needs a gener
[548.839s] generator we came on the show in August
[550.519s] the stock was
[551.72s] $137 it&#39;s all the way up to 180 180 189
[555.12s] today uh some 40% since then this is
[558.48s] going to go not only over 200 it&#39;s going
[560.76s] to keep pushing higher 250 this thing
[562.48s] was close to a $500 stock during covid
[564.959s] they have 70% of the home standby
[567.079s] generator uh system so you&#39;re not the
[568.839s] only one that has it but you&#39;ve got more
[570.64s] hurricanes you&#39;ve got more strain on the
[572.32s] power grid they&#39;re the only game in town
[574.399s] it&#39;s like the kleenex of Home standby
[576.32s] generators Kleenex of home very good one
[578.56s] a nice analogy there Tom good to see you
[580.76s] thanks for being with us I hope you and
[582.04s] your family have a wonderful
[583.0s] Thanksgiving you too thank you
[586.0s] staff and we&#39;re back and we&#39;re going to
[588.519s] get to that data chart later so you can
[590.32s] see what I&#39;m talking about uh and uh and
[593.399s] the data behind a 100 Years of Duties on
[596.0s] Imports and and how we are at that 100
[598.72s] year low so there&#39;s a lot of Runway uh
[602.36s] and then I got a chance to
[606.0s] join uh Liz Neo want to thank on CNA
[609.88s] which is the BBC of uh Asia and based in
[613.72s] Singapore huge audience and Audrey Tay
[616.92s] for having me on the
[618.72s] producer
[619.85s] [Music]
[621.64s] um and we have Thomas Hayes chairman and
[624.72s] managing member at Great Hill Capital
[627.16s] joining us for more now uh Thomas let&#39;s
[628.92s] just have take a look at why investors
[630.76s] are pivoting back to Cy cyclicals and
[633.959s] and stocks and those names tie to the
[635.88s] economy uh which of course help to push
[638.2s] the down the S&amp;P 500 higher
[642.44s] overnight well Liz this is a theme that
[644.839s] started o over the summer and basically
[647.44s] what you&#39;ve been seeing since the
[648.639s] beginning of the year is The Magnificent
[651.2s] Seven or large cap Tech had 50% earnings
[654.959s] growth and that is decelerating to about
[658.0s] mid teens earning growth gr by the
[660.04s] beginning of 2025 whereas the
[663.36s] unmagnify or the the uh economically
[666.399s] sensitive stocks as you reference to to
[669.36s] uh their earnings growth has been
[671.6s] accelerating it was negative in the
[673.399s] beginning of the year and it&#39;s turning
[674.92s] positive and it&#39;s going to move into mid
[676.519s] double digits next year so I think
[678.639s] people want to start to uh slowly add
[682.2s] into the economically sensitive stocks
[684.44s] they&#39;re more cheaply valued and their
[686.76s] earnings growth is going up versus going
[689.399s] yeah yeah and so with that comes the
[691.959s] rotation out of big Tech at the same
[694.32s] time um the tech names they continue to
[696.56s] say that the AI theme is very much
[698.32s] intact still uh despite some worries in
[700.959s] the semiconductor sector how are you
[703.12s] approaching investing in this sector and
[704.959s] also um you know the sort of approach
[707.76s] that the new Trump Administration could
[709.48s] take with the tech
[713.12s] industry yeah well I think people were
[715.079s] eager to get through the Nvidia earnings
[717.44s] report it missed the whisper numbers the
[719.6s] guidance was a little bit mixed but it
[721.72s] was good enough uh to get the market
[724.44s] through they are the the issue with
[727.32s] Nvidia is there was a time that as the
[730.24s] stock went up it became cheaper because
[732.839s] the multiple was coming down due to
[734.6s] growth and growth in profit margins
[736.56s] that&#39;s no longer the case the profit
[737.92s] margins have stopped increasing the
[740.279s] growth is decreasing the multiple is
[742.24s] going up so while they could probably
[744.32s] have maybe a couple quarters of of some
[746.48s] stock appreciation uh I think a lot of
[748.959s] that slowing down and managers as they
[752.16s] get into the next year are probably
[753.279s] going to have to lighten up as it&#39;s
[754.68s] become a larger and larger part of their
[756.76s] portfolio um as far as big Tech I think
[759.6s] people are finding other opportunities
[761.44s] if you looked at Deer today was a big
[763.44s] Gainer but the biggest gainer you
[764.92s] mentioned the Dow uh you mentioned the
[766.959s] S&amp;P you mentioned the NASDAQ and the
[768.76s] difference in performance but the
[769.959s] biggest performer was small cap stocks
[773.32s] they were up 1 and a half% today and
[775.8s] those are the biggest bang for your buck
[777.959s] moving forward you get the most amount
[780.0s] of growth over the next year for the
[782.0s] least amount of multiple and I think
[784.199s] you&#39;re starting to see more and more
[785.8s] people Bren out looking for
[787.399s] opportunities under the surface as maybe
[789.76s] the indices gains led by large Tech
[792.44s] start to slow down a little bit or
[794.839s] certainly normalized relative to the
[796.6s] past two years yeah and actually we see
[799.079s] small cap you know starting to pick up
[801.04s] pa um as you know calls for a trump
[804.0s] Victory kind of firmed up and so you
[806.839s] know when we look at the so-called Trump
[808.76s] trade it&#39;s you know has been a bit of a
[811.32s] a volatile movement I mean right after
[813.399s] the election it was really good of
[815.279s] course you know could be fed by by
[817.44s] sentiment as well but then we saw B
[819.12s] softness and now it&#39;s back up um where
[821.8s] do you expect them to go from here uh
[825.199s] and and and what is exactly that
[827.8s] investors are searching for right
[831.839s] now yeah Liz well it&#39;s interesting
[834.32s] because there were two Trump trades in
[836.68s] Trump 1.0 so you had the election in
[839.8s] November of 2016 followed by the
[842.36s] inauguration in January 2017 what
[845.32s] happened after the election was
[846.88s] different from what happened after the
[849.199s] inauguration meaning uh the dollar rose
[852.32s] right away after he was elected and
[854.24s] bonds fell yields went up but after the
[857.839s] inauguration the dollar re weakened and
[861.399s] bonds got bid and yields came down and I
[864.44s] think the two biggest surprises of 2025
[867.079s] Liz are going to be yields come down and
[871.079s] the dollar goes down and right now
[873.0s] people are positioned in the exact
[875.04s] opposite way and we might be at the peak
[876.639s] of that uh the other thing that people
[879.399s] expect from a trump Administration is
[881.56s] that energy will do exceptionally well
[884.399s] that was not the case in Trump 1.0 if
[887.68s] from the election to the inauguration
[889.959s] energy stocks did extremely well after
[892.36s] the inauguration in January energy did
[895.12s] very very poorly in that first year of
[897.079s] the Trump Administration as you get more
[899.279s] Supply margins are compressed earnings
[901.36s] power is compressed for the energy
[903.24s] companies and I&#39;ll tell you another
[904.8s] thing that did extremely well that again
[907.56s] did poorly after the election and did
[909.48s] very well after the inauguration was
[911.959s] Emerging Markets stocks they did
[915.16s] extremely poorly once he was elected and
[917.32s] extremely well uh from 2017 to 2018
[921.399s] after he was in office you had one of
[922.839s] the biggest rallies in emerging market
[924.48s] stocks in the shortest period of time
[926.759s] and that&#39;s including he was elected on
[928.639s] tar who was elected on protectionism and
[931.44s] those stocks still did well so we&#39;re in
[933.16s] for a lot of positive surprises in 2025
[936.68s] that people may not yet be positioned
[938.759s] for all right Thomas appreciate your
[941.199s] insights and help us look ahead what we
[943.639s] can expect uh when inauguration rolls
[945.519s] around Thomas he chairman and managing
[947.68s] member great Hill
[952.6s] capital and that&#39;s that and then it says
[955.6s] far more this is Peter Lynch quotes of
[957.92s] the week far more money has been lost by
[960.079s] investors preparing for Corrections or
[962.12s] trying to anticipate Corrections than
[964.56s] has been lost in Corrections themselves
[967.839s] that&#39;s an important thing to remember
[969.279s] because you got this Cadre of folks that
[971.639s] are always calling for Corrections for
[973.48s] the last 15 years and kept people out of
[975.68s] the market missing hundreds of percents
[977.319s] of return doubling tripling their money
[979.759s] and uh and potentially retiring earlier
[982.68s] uh we had a late night uh that the club
[986.12s] had uh the anything but Thanksgiving
[988.92s] dinner last night so I was up till 2:30
[991.279s] a.m. doing the article of the week for
[993.759s] you guys which I think you&#39;re going to
[995.0s] find great and my lovely wife drove out
[997.36s] to Duncan to uh get us some uh by the
[1000.759s] way they&#39;re not paying me uh I&#39;m not a
[1002.88s] Starbucks guy so um I keep it simple I
[1005.519s] grew up in Jersey uh got me this
[1008.0s] beautiful iced coffee so I could get
[1009.519s] this podcast out before our guests come
[1012.319s] and uh whether we&#39;re talking about
[1013.8s] stocks or or socks I like buying quality
[1017.92s] merchandise when it&#39;s markdown that&#39;s
[1019.72s] from the all-time great Warren Buffett
[1022.079s] who I&#39;ve learned so much from over the
[1023.72s] years and we followed that as well and
[1026.4s] the key thing here that I think people
[1028.36s] get messed up with with uh value
[1031.48s] investing and or quality value value and
[1034.48s] growth are joined at the hip it the key
[1037.919s] is quality merchandise growing earnings
[1041.88s] growing cash flow and then what do you
[1044.4s] pay for that growth what do you pay for
[1046.0s] that because far too often people get
[1047.559s] caught in businesses uh that are you
[1051.52s] know value traps and and only buying it
[1054.16s] on the basis of liquidation value with
[1055.799s] no plan for re acceleration of growth
[1058.72s] and and that&#39;s where people get tripped
[1060.6s] up or that&#39;s where a negative
[1062.12s] connotation comes from value and you
[1064.16s] have to be able to distinguish the two
[1066.2s] and then finally Buffett your mind is
[1067.88s] like a bank what you deposit you can is
[1069.88s] what you can withdraw and I think people
[1071.799s] always ask me like well how do you get
[1073.48s] into the career how do you do
[1075.96s] this why is Buffett so great blah blah
[1078.44s] blah
[1079.4s] it&#39;s because we read more than anyone
[1081.12s] else I mean and and it compounds over
[1084.08s] years just like money so I can see
[1086.799s] things in two minutes because I have 20
[1089.559s] years of data points 20 years of doing
[1091.84s] it wrong doing it right overcoming
[1094.159s] obstacles seeing uh how things work
[1097.039s] seeing how things rhyme versus repeat uh
[1099.84s] seeing patterns that&#39;s that&#39;s the
[1101.48s] biggest thing that you get over time and
[1102.96s] experience so you just have to put in
[1104.32s] the time and the only way you&#39;re going
[1105.919s] to be willing to put in the time is not
[1107.6s] if you&#39;re looking to get rich overnight
[1109.559s] but if you absolutely love what you do
[1112.32s] and you feel like you&#39;re hopping
[1113.64s] skipping and jumping to work every day
[1116.08s] uh going through a treasure hunt which
[1118.039s] is exactly what I feel like every single
[1120.24s] day so you got to love what you do to be
[1122.88s] the to be to be great at it so uh let&#39;s
[1125.48s] get to the charts of the week this is
[1127.159s] where I was shocked with how much data
[1128.88s] we have to cover this week but it is so
[1131.08s] good and it&#39;s going to set us up for the
[1133.08s] next 12 plus months and I&#39;m super
[1136.159s] excited about that so stop do better
[1139.52s] under reelected presidents early in
[1141.919s] their second terms so in theory we have
[1144.88s] a reelected president in president Trump
[1147.799s] uh there was a four-year Hiatus so that
[1149.679s] year one and year two this is consistent
[1153.08s] with um the presidential cycle in
[1156.44s] general where year one tends to be okay
[1159.32s] a little bit weaker in the first half of
[1160.96s] the Year followed by strength in the
[1162.52s] second half and then that midterm year
[1164.159s] tends to be the weakest of the four-year
[1165.919s] presidential cycle so um I think
[1169.32s] in uh next year our kind of base case is
[1173.32s] like a 7 to 133% on the S&amp;P type of
[1179.0s] range uh and enor But but so much easier
[1183.919s] to make money because all the big gains
[1187.559s] will be under the surface in the non mag
[1191.12s] 7 so those stocks can be up 40 50 70
[1195.24s] some 100% And The indices subdued and
[1198.76s] that&#39;s the environment where we can
[1200.44s] absolutely take advantage of so I&#39;m I&#39;m
[1203.0s] very very excited this is the Russell
[1205.44s] 2000 relative to the Russell 1000
[1208.039s] seasonal patterns since
[1211.28s] 1979 um so the 2000 really picks up in
[1215.2s] December and into the first quarter that
[1217.48s] small caps we&#39;re excited about that
[1219.28s] they&#39;re also breaking out here this is
[1221.159s] Allstar charts uh just a standard small
[1224.559s] cap index and then biotech which is
[1227.72s] really interesting because we have
[1229.32s] exposure to the xbi if you remember we
[1231.919s] bought it in the hole here in
[1234.32s] 2022 uh it immediately rallied we
[1237.159s] thought we were geniuses then it
[1238.799s] Consolidated sideways went back and
[1241.0s] retested we held our ground we added
[1243.76s] more in the hole and now it&#39;s breaking
[1245.52s] out and what&#39;s interesting you see going
[1247.88s] all the way back is this converges with
[1250.24s] small caps with small caps taken off we
[1252.4s] are going to see a massive catch-up
[1254.0s] trade in xbi in 2017 and Beyond
[1259.36s] uh just like you saw in the early Trump
[1261.36s] presidency as well risk appetite comes
[1264.039s] back the game gets on so not only are
[1265.88s] small caps going to keep pushing higher
[1267.72s] as they did during that period but
[1269.64s] biotechs are going to catch up and we&#39;re
[1271.32s] going to Mint on both sides super
[1273.48s] excited for those of you who are with me
[1275.72s] US versus China equities this chart was
[1279.6s] posted by Scott granis to show the
[1281.64s] American exceptionalism and we 100%
[1283.72s] agree with American
[1286.88s] exceptionalism however
[1289.2s] what I look at and where I&#39;ve made my
[1291.2s] career is in capturing benefits of
[1293.799s] dislocated periods and divergences that
[1296.64s] is my knitting I do it very well in my
[1299.76s] view and um and I think what you see
[1302.919s] here that&#39;s more interesting than
[1305.48s] showing the US exceptionalism is the
[1308.2s] catchup trade how China both overshoots
[1312.24s] and unders shoots the US from time to
[1315.32s] time and the last time we had this
[1317.36s] dramatic of an shoot was in 2001 to 2002
[1323.2s] which I continue to reference and you
[1324.919s] get this double bottom down here uh and
[1328.159s] then uh it starts to break out and
[1330.24s] checks back and then you have one of the
[1331.48s] most parabolic moves in China and
[1333.6s] emerging market equities in the shortest
[1335.159s] amount of time in history also under
[1336.96s] Republican Administration by the way uh
[1340.0s] and um not to by the way I mean US Stock
[1344.4s] markets do exceptionally well under
[1345.679s] Democrat presidents as well so I&#39;m not
[1347.84s] saying that to to make a point a
[1349.679s] partisan point I&#39;m saying that to make a
[1351.559s] point that the hawkishness expectations
[1355.279s] are sometimes overrated and this is
[1358.24s] setting up exactly like that period to
[1360.52s] rhyme like it&#39;s going out of style and
[1363.159s] to catch up and then overshoot the US
[1365.64s] performance I think we&#39;re going to see
[1366.84s] that and I think that&#39;s going to be one
[1367.84s] of the biggest surprise is of the Trump
[1370.919s] Administration very similar to the
[1372.6s] catchup we saw 2000 after the uh elected
[1376.08s] and then inaugurated and then catch CAU
[1378.72s] up to the US China performance and then
[1381.039s] overshot so that&#39;s a good
[1383.559s] thing
[1385.24s] um the 10year yield seems capped at five
[1388.08s] so bessent got elected and then it
[1390.24s] rolled over the interesting thing about
[1392.12s] bessent that was a coincident not a
[1394.52s] causal thing by the way what was
[1397.48s] underlying it was the excessive
[1401.64s] positioning that we&#39;ve covered in recent
[1403.24s] weeks as it relates to the commitments
[1405.84s] of Traders report and people the most
[1407.84s] offside on the bond trade hedge funds
[1410.12s] the most short bonds that they&#39;ve been
[1411.96s] since October
[1414.799s] 2018 which preceded one of the largest
[1417.96s] Bond rallies compression of yields that
[1419.64s] we&#39;ve seen in many many years and I
[1422.159s] think we&#39;re nearing that same type of
[1424.039s] thing and this has come in even a little
[1425.72s] bit more uh Economist upgrade China&#39;s
[1428.76s] exports and growth Outlook dollar
[1430.96s] advance may be tempered by bent
[1432.76s] nomination says nothing to do with the
[1434.64s] bessent that&#39;s is coincident it&#39;s
[1436.679s] helpful it doesn&#39;t matter matter what
[1439.279s] the Catalyst was going to be if it was
[1442.08s] going to
[1443.279s] be Russia lobbing a bomb into the
[1446.2s] Ukraine and bonds get bid it doesn&#39;t
[1448.48s] matter the positioning was so off sides
[1451.12s] that the
[1453.0s] market disciplines that type of
[1455.919s] excessive behavior and that&#39;s exactly
[1457.559s] what happened as far as the coincident
[1460.0s] all you needed to look is at is the
[1462.0s] commitments of Traders on the dollar and
[1463.96s] on the bonds and you knew it was too
[1465.559s] crowded large Traders headcut funds on
[1468.0s] the ex alongside the boat so dollar will
[1470.279s] re weaken bond yields will start to come
[1472.96s] down and those will be the two biggest
[1474.52s] surprises of
[1476.559s] 20205 S&amp;P versus healthc care sector
[1479.76s] performance last 12 months there&#39;s a lot
[1481.679s] of opportunities in healthcare we&#39;re
[1483.2s] positioned through xbi we&#39;re open-minded
[1485.76s] to pick up some more Health Care
[1489.279s] opportunities and
[1491.64s] um I think there&#39;s going to be a lot a
[1494.2s] big catch-up trade in the health care
[1496.12s] sector
[1499.08s] moving along we&#39;ve got initial jobless
[1501.76s] claims went down that&#39;s good May uh
[1505.6s] affect odds of a cut
[1508.2s] in December although it&#39;s been moving
[1511.32s] around it got down to a coin flip uh
[1513.88s] before I delete this one sentiment came
[1515.96s] down on the a aaii sentiment
[1518.76s] survey uh bullishness came down to 30%
[1522.039s] 37% bearishness went up so that&#39;s good
[1525.24s] there&#39;s not Euphoria so I think we can
[1527.88s] push High and there&#39;s just like who are
[1530.559s] the natural sellers in a year like this
[1532.24s] there&#39;s not
[1533.64s] much tax loss people don&#39;t want to pay
[1536.52s] the taxes until next year so like
[1539.039s] expecting a big correction in December
[1540.679s] just because we&#39;re quote unquote
[1541.88s] overvalued look at this this must be
[1544.039s] from the FED minutes these odds
[1547.159s] dramatically changed a week ago you had
[1550.159s] 55% odds of a December cut now you&#39;re
[1552.399s] back up to 70% cut uh chance of a cut in
[1556.32s] December so that&#39;s really good if they
[1558.08s] get this cut in uh I think they can be
[1560.799s] done for a while at least till after
[1562.96s] March uh they can just wait and see
[1565.88s] which would be really good because it
[1568.0s] will cement the idea that they are not a
[1571.84s] politically based
[1573.52s] organization that they did two cuts
[1575.679s] after the election and then they can
[1577.2s] just wait and wait and wait and maybe
[1579.36s] they&#39;ll only need one more in 2025 by
[1581.679s] frontloading them very smart uh and
[1584.88s] maximum maybe two but uh that&#39;s the
[1587.32s] perfect mid cycle Playbook like we saw
[1589.84s] in 1995 another Regional manufacturing
[1592.72s] ticking up Japan inflation holds above
[1595.399s] boj Target Fanning December rate hike
[1598.919s] bets we&#39;ve been talking about this
[1600.32s] ladies and gentlemen stronger Yen weaker
[1603.279s] dollar money flows out of Japan back
[1606.36s] into China this is the theme this is
[1608.88s] happening in real time natural gas
[1611.399s] prices turning around like nobody&#39;s
[1613.679s] business I mean by the way what about
[1615.559s] Comstock resources like I say we we
[1617.64s] rarely spend time on the winners but
[1619.12s] that thing&#39;s up from $9 to $15 in like
[1621.6s] the last five weeks that&#39;s like a you
[1624.32s] know 55 50 6 six times about 60% gain uh
[1631.159s] and we don&#39;t even talk about it but we
[1632.84s] love that that&#39;s going to continue to
[1634.039s] work higher intrinsic values a lot
[1636.2s] higher and uh a few bags from here
[1639.64s] widespread snowfall and icy conditions
[1641.44s] sweep across Europe with arrival of
[1643.12s] polar coldfront that&#39;s good they need to
[1645.679s] buy their Goose Canada Goose now called
[1648.76s] snow goose we&#39;re going to talk about
[1650.44s] that
[1651.52s] jackets I ordered one awesome vest to go
[1654.919s] play paddle in the winter and also you
[1657.48s] can wear it underneath a top coat when
[1659.52s] it&#39;s super cold so I&#39;m excited to get
[1661.44s] that in biggest outflow from healthc
[1663.24s] care since December 2023 it&#39;s one of the
[1665.399s] reasons I love Healthcare right now we
[1667.6s] also saw the exact same thing right
[1669.159s] after Trump got elected and what
[1670.76s] outperformed xbi afterwards dollar is
[1673.84s] expensive we agree going to roll back
[1675.72s] over re weaken probably related to the
[1678.44s] cut the hike that&#39;s coming from
[1681.84s] boj in December globalization to
[1687.0s] isolationism this is the chart ladies
[1689.08s] and gentlemen this is what I was
[1691.279s] referring to with Stuart vanney and um
[1696.44s] this is absolutely amazing because not
[1699.24s] only are us duties collected as a
[1703.399s] percentage of total Imports near
[1707.12s] 130e
[1708.679s] lows but they are lower than they were
[1712.64s] under Clinton under Carter for sure
[1716.72s] under
[1717.88s] JFK under all the favorite Democrats had
[1723.08s] higher duties and tariffs collected as a
[1726.279s] percentage of total Imports and for
[1728.679s] those folks saying if we do tariffs the
[1731.679s] Market&#39;s going to crash just like Holly
[1734.32s] Smoot go read a history book they put
[1737.08s] the tariffs on in 1930 and we got a
[1739.559s] great depression and the stock market
[1741.159s] crashed 90% well when you burden
[1743.96s] yourself with the facts you can see that
[1746.559s] right after the Spanish Flu which is
[1749.159s] just like we just had covid uh tariffs
[1753.159s] increased from a many decade low which
[1757.36s] they bottomed at about 6% and over the
[1761.0s] next 12 years prior to Holly Smoot the
[1765.799s] percentage of Duties collected on total
[1768.36s] Imports Grew From 56% to
[1772.72s] 20% okay uh Forex 300% increase in
[1777.36s] tariffs for 12 years before Smoot Holly
[1781.799s] was announced in 1930 and you got your
[1784.12s] crash so put it in perspective number
[1787.12s] one we&#39;re starting from a much lower
[1789.679s] base and for those of you who don&#39;t know
[1793.32s] the 20s was one of the greatest booms in
[1796.32s] history economically speaking
[1798.96s] uh growth GDP the whole thing new
[1801.64s] Industries same thing we have it was
[1803.519s] called The
[1805.0s] Roaring 20s and we are going to have the
[1808.6s] Roaring and having the Roaring 2020s so
[1812.279s] you have a 10-year Runway even if Trump
[1814.32s] went crazy with tariffs which he won&#39;t
[1817.08s] because he likes to see the stock market
[1818.64s] go up um we&#39;ve got 10year Runway and
[1822.679s] this could go from 3% to probably 15%
[1826.48s] before we had a massive problem people
[1828.2s] like well how how can that happen
[1829.6s] because you&#39;re going to see a lot of
[1831.159s] massive real and nominal GDP growth over
[1833.64s] the next four years plus and um so put
[1837.08s] this chart print it out put it on your
[1839.559s] wall and for the next two years every
[1841.72s] time you hear the word Smoot Holly you
[1844.12s] can Snicker and buy stocks so uh two
[1847.96s] years in a row isn&#39;t a reason to be
[1850.76s] bearish when the Market&#39;s up 20% two
[1852.6s] years in a row uh this is Ryan Dietrich
[1855.76s] at Carson showing the average return for
[1858.0s] the next year is
[1859.679s] 12.3% median 12.8% my favorite chart of
[1863.519s] all time this is emerging market stocks
[1866.6s] relative to US Stocks going back and all
[1869.76s] I can say
[1871.279s] is again the these are the opportunities
[1875.08s] where fortunes are generational fortunes
[1877.639s] are made when you can catch these lows
[1880.44s] these divergences like you haven&#39;t had
[1882.96s] since the Reagan error second term of
[1885.08s] the Reagan error second term of the
[1886.76s] Trump error when Emerging Markets
[1889.12s] relative to us markets were as cheap as
[1892.72s] they are and Bush to in 2001 again two
[1897.639s] Republican
[1898.84s] administrations uh and then you also had
[1900.84s] Carter you had uh Nixon before Carter
[1903.72s] and you saw this come off the bo come
[1906.44s] off the lows uh Emerging Markets being
[1909.399s] the Rock Bottom cheap relative to the US
[1913.44s] and the big analogy I like to use is
[1915.36s] 2001 we&#39;re we&#39;re lower than that level
[1917.919s] and the fortunes that are going to be
[1919.36s] made by the people that take advantage
[1920.76s] of this and look we could be wrong and
[1922.639s] it could take two more years to bottom
[1924.96s] out but it doesn&#39;t matter when you&#39;re
[1926.48s] buying with that margin of safety and
[1927.72s] you&#39;re not on
[1929.039s] Leverage I&#39;m going to bet we&#39;re there
[1931.36s] now okay and
[1933.84s] um and once it gets started it is so
[1937.72s] it&#39;s unreal it is unreal so there we are
[1940.76s] consumers are bullish on stocks this was
[1944.159s] posted um this is from Renaissance macro
[1946.96s] as a reason to get cautious except for
[1949.0s] the fact that when you see consumers get
[1951.679s] bullish on stocks after the these great
[1955.159s] despondent levels like 2009 like 2011
[1959.32s] like 1991 recession that first spike is
[1963.12s] just the beginning of good things to
[1964.639s] come when you&#39;re coming off those lows
[1966.6s] same thing with 2003 beginning of good
[1968.639s] things to come 2009 2011 and so on so
[1972.76s] this extreme is is the beginning because
[1975.76s] you&#39;re coming off such lows it over
[1977.84s] overshoots on the low end overshoots on
[1979.88s] the upper end big gains after big gains
[1983.44s] return tend to be more moderate okay
[1985.32s] well we saw Ryan stuff that&#39;s actually
[1987.279s] more empirical this is also interesting
[1990.2s] during the 2018 to 2019 trade War
[1993.44s] margins came in below what volume growth
[1995.919s] implied so what they&#39;re trying to say is
[1998.039s] because of the trade War margins
[2001.36s] deteriorated except for the fact that
[2004.159s] margins were still higher than they were
[2007.44s] under Clinton in the late 90s and the
[2009.399s] stock market did well after the midcycle
[2011.0s] correction in
[2012.32s] 1995 uh so again coincident versus
[2017.36s] causal are two different stories and you
[2019.32s] have to be wary of getting faked out and
[2023.24s] the secret to not getting faked out in
[2025.279s] my experience is uh zoom out okay so
[2029.919s] don&#39;t just look oh well that if margins
[2031.84s] are going to contract I better get out
[2033.08s] of stocks because of the trade War if
[2035.12s] you go back you can see when tariffs
[2037.159s] were higher on Clinton the market had
[2039.279s] the biggest growth in the shortest
[2040.559s] amount of time from the midcycle
[2041.88s] correction 95 and the FED stepped in did
[2044.399s] a few cuts and We R even though margins
[2047.76s] were even lower than they were during
[2049.2s] the quote unquote trade War so we&#39;re
[2051.32s] tariffs by the way under under Clinton
[2054.24s] uh consumer confidence index turning
[2056.159s] back up Global money market funds
[2059.04s] elevated that money is going to come
[2060.52s] back in demographics are tailing to
[2062.679s] housing demand look how many 33 year
[2064.879s] olds this is why we&#39;ve been pounding the
[2067.24s] table un roaring 2020s demographics
[2070.839s] Drive spending you buy a house you buy a
[2073.599s] car you buy uh a crib you buy diapers
[2077.399s] you buy uh stuff to show off in your 30s
[2080.639s] when you care about that stuff uh buy
[2083.28s] your 40s you&#39;re already comfortable with
[2085.0s] what what you&#39;ve accomplished and uh and
[2087.2s] who you are and then you just do it for
[2088.679s] the love of the game but um but that
[2091.359s] drives spending and this is where we are
[2093.24s] ladies and gentlemen and by the way
[2094.879s] China&#39;s similar they&#39;re a little bit
[2096.56s] older but they got you three to five
[2098.48s] years and by the way for everyone who
[2100.04s] thinks I&#39;m a China Dove and I love China
[2101.88s] and all that stuff nothing of the sort
[2104.079s] let me tell you something I will be
[2106.24s] twice as pessimistic on China as I am on
[2108.56s] Japan right now five years from now when
[2110.88s] their demographics change I just deal
[2112.88s] with data I don&#39;t care about ideology
[2115.72s] and narratives and feelings and all that
[2118.52s] stuff I deal exclusively with data and
[2120.96s] right now it&#39;s time to buy China and
[2123.2s] it&#39;s time to buy the US and that&#39;s going
[2124.88s] to persist for at least 5 to seven years
[2127.96s] Plus in the US probably it could go as
[2129.96s] much as 10 years in China I think it&#39;s a
[2132.359s] fiveyear window we&#39;re going to see
[2134.24s] massive growth in a short amount of time
[2136.72s] and then we are going to be out of China
[2138.52s] and for those who think China is going
[2140.119s] to be the next great power uh it&#39;s going
[2142.16s] to be the next great Japan after that
[2144.04s] last parabolic move go back and look at
[2145.88s] the Nik index and the demographics of
[2148.48s] the late 80s for Japan same exact story
[2151.24s] their toast the one Child Left Behind is
[2153.76s] going to hit them it&#39;s not going to hit
[2154.92s] them in the next five years they&#39;re
[2156.0s] still golden it&#39;s going to hit them
[2157.72s] after that and they&#39;ll never be able to
[2158.96s] recover so don&#39;t worry about that us
[2161.52s] homes are getting smaller I should do
[2163.16s] more of these podcasts on coffee this is
[2166.119s] wild this is a theme we&#39;ve been talking
[2168.52s] about think levit Town we&#39;re going to
[2171.2s] solve the housing thing under Trump
[2172.72s] they&#39;re going to build so many small
[2173.839s] homes it&#39;s going to knock your socks off
[2175.64s] they&#39;re going to get the zoning uh thing
[2177.839s] so people can get reson they can build
[2179.44s] the houses get people in houses raise
[2181.16s] families rock and roll absorb new new
[2184.16s] positive immigration which this country
[2186.2s] makes this country great You&#39; got to
[2188.4s] have massive immigration you just want
[2189.92s] to have a a a a um systems in place to
[2194.839s] make sure you&#39;re not letting in the
[2195.96s] wrong things and if you look at Trump&#39;s
[2198.0s] tariff threats all three of them were
[2200.04s] related to Fentanyl and I think if you
[2202.04s] know anything about Trump and you read
[2203.72s] the art of the deal uh or you watch a
[2206.44s] movie I watched this movie called The
[2207.839s] Apprentice it was a hitpiece on Trump
[2209.52s] before the election I didn&#39;t find it to
[2211.88s] be a hitpiece actually I learned a lot
[2213.359s] about it watching it and I thought it
[2215.24s] was pretty
[2216.359s] useful um
[2218.24s] but you know they showed how his brother
[2219.8s] died because he was an alcoholic and I
[2222.04s] think this is an important issue for
[2224.119s] Trump uh in that he
[2227.56s] is so focused on keeping the Fentanyl
[2230.72s] and JD Vance who grew up in a drug uh I
[2233.64s] think his mother had drug problems uh
[2236.04s] keeping that stuff out of this country
[2238.24s] that Trump&#39;s announcement of China
[2240.68s] tariffs wasn&#39;t like CH China we&#39;re going
[2243.68s] to tariff you ideologically because we
[2245.72s] don&#39;t like you like you know other
[2247.96s] ideological uh groups had been doing
[2250.72s] he&#39;s saying you have not kept your word
[2252.96s] on the death penalty for people pushing
[2255.48s] fanol into our country through the
[2257.119s] Mexico and Canada borders therefore
[2259.16s] we&#39;re going to increase another 10% by
[2260.76s] the way not 60% another 10% which is a
[2263.319s] lot less than advertised he also said
[2265.88s] the same thing to Mexico and he said the
[2268.68s] same thing to Canada you&#39;re going to
[2269.96s] keep letting these drugs pour into the
[2271.359s] country and kill our people in the
[2272.76s] midwest who are struggling then the
[2275.44s] hardworking people then you&#39;re 25%
[2278.56s] tariff 25% tariff all of a sudden the
[2280.52s] lady got on the phone president of
[2282.2s] Mexico she said I&#39;m sorry we&#39;re going to
[2284.0s] we&#39;re going to close it down now it&#39;s
[2285.359s] not that simple it&#39;s not like a door
[2287.119s] they can just lock the door but it&#39;s
[2289.24s] moving them in the right direction
[2291.0s] Trudeau same story they&#39;ll get it right
[2293.72s] they&#39;ll come to some accommodation but
[2295.96s] you know the free lunch is over and uh
[2298.4s] and I think that&#39;s going to be a great
[2299.64s] thing for the country in the near term
[2302.68s] and look for those of you who are not in
[2304.8s] accordance with that benefit from the
[2307.119s] ride
[2308.04s] everything reverts to the mean so it&#39;s
[2310.0s] going to it it&#39;ll go back to the center
[2313.16s] in a couple of years maximum four years
[2316.079s] probably two years but I think it&#39;s
[2318.52s] going to lay a framework for many many
[2320.28s] years of growth ahead and jobs and and
[2323.68s] people that are not in the top 1% and
[2326.44s] not in the top 5% and not in the top 10%
[2329.24s] the people that actually build stuff
[2330.64s] with their hands that have made this
[2332.119s] country at the amazing country that it
[2334.16s] is are going to start doing
[2335.839s] exceptionally well like they did from
[2338.76s] 20167 to
[2341.0s] 2019 uh before the the flu came in uh
[2345.92s] and there&#39;s nothing like it I mean you
[2348.4s] can just feel the excitement in the air
[2351.24s] when you&#39;re out there people are you
[2353.76s] know in in the stock market we call it
[2355.839s] animal spirits we&#39;re going to see some
[2357.319s] data on that but just generally people
[2360.92s] are happy they feel good and I think
[2364.359s] that&#39;s going to go a long way that
[2366.04s] confidence ticking back up to uh really
[2368.599s] having a great great run the next four
[2370.48s] plus years economically speaking for a
[2372.599s] lot of people not just a few people for
[2374.319s] a lot of people and uh I grew up
[2376.64s] carrying golf bags I grew up washing
[2378.92s] dishes I grew up with the newspaper
[2380.76s] route I grew up with all that so that is
[2382.88s] important to me because I know what it
[2385.319s] is to grind I know what it is to have
[2387.4s] grit I know what it is to you know be in
[2389.96s] your early 20s and figure out how am I
[2391.599s] going to pay my electric bill uh I know
[2394.119s] all that stuff and um you know a lot of
[2396.599s] people don&#39;t know that about me and they
[2398.119s] think oh it just you know it&#39;s funny I
[2399.96s] get comments on Twitter and uh this and
[2402.48s] that and people are saying oh you know
[2405.0s] must have been hard to come from mommy
[2406.4s] and daddy&#39;s money I wish you know
[2408.56s] actually I don&#39;t wish because if that
[2411.359s] had been the case uh I don&#39;t think I
[2413.76s] would have had the joy and the uh
[2417.24s] fulfillment that comes from overcoming
[2419.079s] massive obstacles and scraping by and
[2421.359s] the appreciation that comes with that so
[2424.48s] um um all right we&#39;re off track up 20
[2429.16s] okay we covered that from Carson summary
[2431.4s] of our forecast changes versus
[2434.52s] consensus this is from Bank of America
[2436.96s] so they&#39;re looking at
[2439.52s] GDP uh they&#39;ve taken their
[2443.04s] estimates up a little bit uh higher for
[2446.64s] 2025 GDP up to 2.3 I think they&#39;re going
[2449.28s] to be low there unemployment rate
[2451.48s] they&#39;ve taken it down from 4.5 to 44
[2454.56s] inflation they&#39;ve taken it up okay so
[2456.52s] they&#39;re kind of that thing but if you
[2458.64s] actually look at the first Trump
[2459.8s] Administration inflation actually
[2461.68s] trended lower you get 3 million barrels
[2463.96s] excess of energy back on the market from
[2466.16s] increasing land leases and all that
[2467.92s] stuff uh that is going to be a big
[2471.24s] deflationary factor the second thing is
[2474.04s] if they cut 50% of what they&#39;re talking
[2476.64s] about at Doge and if you&#39;re betting
[2478.8s] against VC and elon&#39;s ability to get
[2481.599s] stuff done uh you&#39;re making a strong
[2484.64s] mistake I you know I think that
[2487.28s] especially because it&#39;s going to come
[2488.24s] down to the Supreme Court and uh I you
[2491.44s] know I can&#39;t see two trillion but these
[2493.079s] guys continue especially Elon has
[2494.92s] continue to surprise us it always takes
[2496.96s] longer than than he says it&#39;s going to
[2498.48s] take but he eventually gets it done so
[2500.88s] uh I don&#39;t know about two trillion that
[2502.119s] would be deflationary and Trump likes to
[2503.72s] see the market the stock market go up
[2505.68s] but a trillion to 500 billion I think is
[2508.119s] in the bag and that&#39;s deflationary bring
[2510.839s] inflation down will be offset by some of
[2513.44s] the stimulatory practices deregulation
[2515.92s] Etc home equity lines of credit have
[2518.44s] increased the
[2520.599s] regredi if that&#39;s a word of the American
[2523.319s] Consumer is just beginning you&#39;re going
[2525.44s] to see consumption come back in spades
[2527.2s] that&#39;s going to help a lot of our
[2528.72s] consumer discretionary Etc one of which
[2530.72s] we&#39;re going to talk about today US Stock
[2532.64s] Market concentration record high that&#39;s
[2534.44s] going to be changing 75y year high in US
[2537.92s] Stocks versus rest of the world that&#39;s
[2539.559s] going to be changing doesn&#39;t mean US
[2541.319s] Stocks crash means that rest of world
[2543.359s] starts to
[2545.319s] outperform in a meaningful way
[2548.96s] BFA forecasting 124 rate cuts by global
[2552.0s] central banks in 2025 that could be part
[2554.119s] of the reason why uh out us uh xus
[2557.559s] starts to
[2559.52s] outperform and these are periods as
[2561.96s] we&#39;ve covered before when you see these
[2564.8s] plus Century marks of global fed Cuts
[2568.24s] it&#39;s time to be buyers in the whole not
[2570.64s] sellers you don&#39;t want to be selling
[2572.52s] stocks in 2009 with 205 Cuts you don&#39;t
[2575.319s] want to be selling stocks in
[2577.64s] uh 2020 Co lows when there&#39;s 162 Global
[2581.72s] Cuts same thing in 2024 153 plus 154
[2585.72s] this may be the most amount of cuts in
[2587.119s] the shortest period of time in history
[2588.68s] you want to be a seller of this no you
[2590.28s] want to be a buyer and you want to be a
[2592.24s] buyer of international to get the most
[2594.599s] value for your buck price is what you
[2596.68s] pay value is what you&#39;re going to get
[2598.4s] this major Chinese ETF set for record
[2601.64s] monthly outflows they&#39;re selling in the
[2604.079s] hole we&#39;re buying in the hole we now
[2606.28s] have meaningfully more options on Baba
[2610.76s] than we did before the September Spike
[2613.839s] where we took off uh I think it was like
[2616.68s] 80 90% we still have a few of those by
[2618.8s] the way um at monstrous profits so
[2624.839s] um I&#39;ve never been more excited and I&#39;m
[2627.28s] so grateful if you remember when teer
[2631.119s] went on TV and said buy everything buy
[2633.96s] everything and uh I&#39;m going over my
[2636.16s] position limits blah blah blah and um
[2639.839s] and he said I&#39;m praying that we get a
[2642.8s] massive pullback here so that I can go
[2646.52s] way over my position limits and buy way
[2649.319s] more than I&#39;ve already bought and Baba
[2651.16s] is his number one position by the way uh
[2654.24s] and what now that we got that pullback
[2657.72s] okay and this week everyone was under
[2659.0s] the table round trip okay we
[2663.2s] were buying and I&#39;m sure terer was also
[2665.359s] buying in the hole and you&#39;re going to
[2667.24s] over the next 12 months what happens
[2668.64s] after the inauguration we&#39;re very
[2670.119s] excited about that I
[2672.359s] mean I was so excited to see what
[2674.68s] happened in September October and so
[2677.0s] grateful for that uh it just went
[2679.52s] parabolic we had to hit the window on
[2681.4s] the options we didn&#39;t sell a share of
[2682.68s] stock by the way so yeah we you know so
[2686.559s] uh but I didn&#39;t think we&#39;d get an
[2688.64s] opportunity to extend out and to get
[2692.0s] this type of exposure in the hole it&#39;s
[2695.76s] super duper exciting uh pce
[2699.319s] prices going down moving in the right
[2701.559s] direction continuing job jobless claims
[2703.72s] moving up that is probably what got the
[2708.72s] um maybe I should switch to water too
[2711.0s] much energy
[2712.72s] here uh that is probably what got the
[2716.48s] FED odds back up to 70% which is
[2720.359s] huge four-week average coming down of
[2723.88s] the jobless claims
[2727.28s] Services PMI continue to climb that&#39;s
[2729.599s] massive expansion just like you see off
[2731.76s] major
[2732.72s] lows uh consumer sentiment index turning
[2738.119s] up last month or so turning
[2742.2s] up household consumption consensus
[2744.88s] forecast turning up since the election
[2748.119s] Japan department store sales collapsing
[2751.04s] below the zero line everyone piled into
[2755.2s] Japan last year they&#39;re getting taken
[2757.599s] out to the Woodshed that doesn&#39;t
[2759.319s] preclude buying cheap Japanese companies
[2761.28s] that do most of their business abroad
[2762.68s] there are opportunities there and smart
[2764.559s] people know where to find them but
[2768.24s] um chasing the crowd after the move is
[2771.72s] not the way to go net bullish opened
[2774.2s] option strategies so you&#39;re seeing this
[2777.48s] uh but that&#39;s just at the nent early
[2779.68s] stages of animal spirits biggest outflow
[2781.92s] in the past two week from treasuries
[2783.52s] again exact wrong time when did you see
[2786.64s] that late 2018 before the biggest rally

[2819.4s] blah and then we&#39;d go back down to 58
[2821.76s] and we&#39;d be like ladies and gentlemen
[2823.92s] cash flow going up buying back six
[2825.8s] billion of shares generating six billion

[2854.079s] excellent shape so everyone&#39;s saying oh
[2856.48s] uh defaults and car loans and all this

[2861.88s] disposable income is near alltime
[2865.2s] lows uh this is the gas power
[2868.16s] composition natural gas is the name of
[2869.8s] the game love you com stock all as other
[2873.0s] crime slow shoplifting sores this has
[2875.48s] hurt retailers 24% of increase in
[2878.76s] shoplifting this game is going to be
[2880.92s] over in the Trump Administration yeah it
[2883.16s] needs to be dealt with on a local level
[2885.28s] but there was a message sent in the last
[2887.2s] four weeks that this stuff is no longer
[2889.119s] acceptable the American people are
[2890.92s] demanding people take action it is not
[2894.52s] okay to steal less than ,000 of

[2900.079s] unscathed uh I&#39;m not saying we need the
[2902.2s] fentol death penalty but there needs to
[2904.24s] be some teeth this is unacceptable uh
[2907.28s] this is stealing from jobs this is
[2908.8s] stealing from people&#39;s pockets this is
[2910.319s] stealing from owner pockets and uh and
[2912.96s] not a good thing so uh this will get
[2915.0s] fixed this will help consumer
[2916.359s] discretionary this will help some of the
[2918.04s] retailers on their last legs and save a
[2919.96s] lot of jobs Dallas fed Manufacturing
[2922.839s] Index another Regional index going up

[2935.559s] accelerate just like we saw at the
[2937.359s] beginning of the last Trump
[2938.68s] Administration 1.0 you have not seen
[2941.319s] this many quote Animal Spirits
[2943.119s] references since the first Trump
[2945.319s] Administration which means risk is on
[2947.319s] which means m&amp;a which means deals which
[2950.68s] means refinancing which means All Good
[2953.64s] Things economically speaking
[2956.0s] ideologically that&#39;s wrong podcast
[2958.16s] ladies and gentlemen I could care less
[2959.559s] about that um economically that&#39;s why
[2963.48s] you tuned in Chinese exports are on
[2965.839s] track for another bump year so this is
[2968.16s] not you know this is buried in the
[2969.64s] headlines no one wants to talk about
[2971.839s] that that will continue for another few
[2974.24s] years in my view linia cold weather
[2976.799s] could tighten natural gas markets eia
[2978.96s] says we&#39;ve seen it in the natural gas
[2980.64s] prices here&#39;s the Russell 2000 breaking
[2982.44s] out to all-time highs couldn&#39;t give it
[2984.44s] away last year we kept pounding the
[2985.839s] table everything thing everyone said
[2987.48s] shut up with your small caps already
[2989.559s] blah blah blah there were two guys
[2991.079s] talking small caps three guys uh Tom
[2994.28s] Hayes Ryan Dietrich and Tom Lee in big
[2996.92s] ways everyone gave Tom Lee a lot of you
[2999.16s] know what because they didn&#39;t go up 50%
[3002.0s] in 5 minutes so it&#39;s taking a year and a
[3004.119s] half uh maybe 18 months and uh and now
[3007.96s] people are like oh yeah that that makes
[3010.119s] sense uh midcaps versus large caps just
[3013.24s] starting to turn the corner this is a
[3015.24s] proxy for small cap relative value as
[3018.0s] well uh and that huge opportunity last
[3021.359s] time we saw was in 2020 it&#39;s happening
[3024.079s] all over again small cat uh us S&amp;P price
[3028.28s] index um who is this Deutsche Bank is
[3031.48s] saying it&#39;s going to get to 7,000 by the
[3033.16s] end of next year I think that&#39;s a little
[3035.04s] optimistic I think that takes two years
[3037.76s] or a year and a half at least uh then
[3040.319s] you&#39;ve got S&amp;P 500 sector groups
[3043.24s] earnings growth for next year forecast
[3047.04s] so they&#39;re seeing huge earnings growth
[3050.119s] in uh in materials we&#39;ve got album Mar
[3054.72s] we got to get more materials exposure
[3058.359s] if we can find some maybe some in the a
[3060.28s] space those are so cyclical but they
[3062.0s] might get interesting you also saw Carl
[3064.799s] icon do that uh here&#39;s the 10year
[3067.2s] rolling over as we had anticipated it&#39;ll
[3069.68s] be fits and starts but that&#39;s the
[3071.16s] direction of path fomc men mentions of
[3075.76s] restrictive or related words and phrases
[3078.119s] collapsing so but they are still
[3079.92s] restrictive they do have to come down
[3082.04s] probably a couple of cuts more to be in
[3084.44s] neutral territory but they don&#39;t have to
[3086.119s] come down six more that&#39;s for sure three
[3088.64s] is a terminal 3% terminal rate is not
[3092.24s] going to happen consumer conference
[3094.2s] board confidence just spiked up in the
[3096.48s] last month consumer expectations spiked
[3100.0s] up in the last few months consumer board
[3102.76s] one-year inflation expectations still
[3104.68s] going down Advanced decline this is the
[3107.839s] S&amp;P 500 shows how breath is improving
[3110.72s] midcaps breaking out Advanced decline
[3112.839s] small caps breaking out Advanced
[3115.24s] decline cap growth going up uh options
[3119.24s] Traders Target higher US Treasury yields
[3122.839s] this is the perfect example of the crowd
[3126.079s] being doing the exact wrong thing at the
[3128.28s] exact wrong time so just as 10-year
[3131.0s] yield Trump got elected 10 year yield
[3133.119s] went up to 4.4 and change what did they
[3136.28s] do like Lemmings they all went out and
[3138.24s] bought options on
[3141.4s] 465
[3142.92s] 485 and these are all the macro funds
[3145.319s] all you know they just because they wear
[3147.799s] ties and have fancy credentials doesn&#39;t
[3150.0s] mean they&#39;re not Lemmings and they don&#39;t
[3151.559s] crowd into the wrong things at the wrong
[3153.28s] time and uh and that&#39;s exactly what
[3155.88s] happened here so what&#39;s going to happen
[3157.799s] all of this premium is going to
[3159.319s] evaporate and the Schmucks who bought it
[3161.079s] are going to be left with goose egg and
[3162.799s] the Geniuses who sold it are going to M
[3164.96s] mint money and uh and that&#39;s the way the
[3167.88s] game works rolling four-year average
[3170.04s] flows positive the last two weeks this
[3172.92s] is net buys of us equities uh
[3177.2s] uh they&#39;ve been selling all year long
[3180.76s] while the indices have gone up and now
[3182.839s] they&#39;re playing the catch-up trade into
[3184.2s] year end Average stock trades as a wide
[3186.839s] discount to the index this is where the
[3188.88s] fortunes are going to be made ladies and
[3191.04s] gentlemen in the next year uh in the uh
[3194.96s] Average stock valuation relative to the
[3197.04s] S&amp;P is so inexpensive and we didn&#39;t
[3200.16s] haven&#39;t seen this since 2001 which has
[3203.24s] been a template for what we&#39;re talking
[3205.92s] about in in coming years top seven S&amp;P
[3209.079s] companies account for 30% of The
[3210.839s] Benchmark that is going to change uh
[3213.04s] Peak growth priced in for the
[3214.799s] Magnificent
[3216.28s] 7 you haven&#39;t seen this level of extreme
[3219.599s] since two late 2021 before the mag 7
[3224.4s] dramatically underperformed in 2022 and
[3228.52s] a lot of people got smoke chasing at the
[3230.28s] end of 2021 when they didn&#39;t want to buy
[3232.52s] in 2020 I&#39;m not saying mag 7 is going to
[3234.92s] crash I am saying they are are going to
[3236.799s] underperform over the next two years uh
[3239.559s] no and they have been for the last six
[3241.28s] months by the way
[3244.72s] um water now my favorite mug for my
[3247.28s] buddies in
[3248.359s] Dallas hedge
[3250.28s] fund tips and that was when we were at
[3253.44s] episode 200 now we&#39;re at
[3256.64s] 267 November Global fund manager survey
[3259.76s] long magnificent 7 is still the most
[3261.92s] crowded
[3264.119s] trade globalization contributed to
[3266.599s] margin expansion in the 20 in the
[3270.24s] 2000s uh 1980s to early 2000s labor
[3275.44s] efficiency gains we&#39;ve just broken out
[3278.4s] uh this is what you saw starting in the
[3280.079s] Reagan Administration all the way
[3281.44s] through the Clinton Administration where
[3283.88s] the revenue per worker just absolutely
[3286.559s] accelerated we&#39;ve been consolidating
[3288.52s] sideways for over a decade and a half
[3291.04s] and we just broke out labor efficiency
[3293.559s] is growing that is the magic ingredient
[3297.16s] uh productivity and efficiency gains for
[3300.64s] long-term bull markets of which we are
[3303.079s] in smack dab in the middle of uh and
[3306.119s] will probably end in the early
[3309.119s] 2030s uh bullishness is Extreme but not
[3312.64s] excessive we&#39;re nowhere near where we
[3314.559s] were in the early
[3316.28s] 2000s uh this is the PE which is skewed
[3320.359s] by mag 7 so the opportunities under the
[3323.76s] hood valuation currently suggests 0 to
[3327.64s] 1% per anom price returns over the next
[3330.52s] decade I love this this is so beautiful
[3333.039s] ladies and gentlemen because they&#39;re
[3335.68s] basically saying all the gains for the
[3337.44s] next decade are gone you&#39;re going to get
[3339.0s] no gains from S&amp;P and you see this lost
[3341.64s] decade every few years the uh
[3345.96s] I&#39;m not even G to point out but just
[3348.839s] Google lost decade and you&#39;ll see all
[3351.16s] the people from uh the lows in 2009 who
[3354.76s] have been saying it for the last 15
[3356.52s] years and uh they used to manage
[3359.4s] trillions of dollars of money and these
[3361.839s] guys were just getting it wrong for a
[3363.88s] decade and we haven&#39;t been this low in
[3367.88s] terms of expectations the secret to
[3369.76s] happiness is low expectations since when
[3372.359s] since 2001 and you had the biggest
[3375.76s] growth in the shortest amount of time in
[3377.88s] emerging market stocks when expectations
[3380.599s] for US Stocks were at zero for the next
[3383.16s] 10 years and that&#39;s exactly where we are
[3386.039s] now and people are using this as a
[3387.68s] reason to say get out of stocks at the
[3389.48s] exact wrong time uh and you wanted to be
[3392.4s] getting into stocks in 2001 not only us
[3395.319s] to a lesser extent but to a larger
[3397.2s] extent xus Emerging Markets lower
[3400.2s] financial leverage than the 1990s and
[3402.319s] 2000s so healthy balance sheets higher
[3405.079s] quality composition than prior decades
[3407.079s] more asset light so you it warrants
[3409.44s] higher multiples as the point they&#39;re
[3410.839s] making economic data surprises have
[3413.319s] turned more positive uh we covered the
[3416.44s] margin issue m&amp;a tracking above 2022 and
[3420.96s] 2023 levels uh that&#39;s going to persist
[3424.2s] the question is how much of it&#39;s priced
[3425.599s] into the big Banks which is why we took
[3427.2s] profits on City over the summer which
[3429.319s] basically has done nothing since um so
[3432.2s] if we get some type of pullback
[3434.52s] scare which usually you do in February
[3437.92s] people start taking
[3439.64s] gains um and raising cash for taxes and
[3443.52s] all that stuff so February you usually
[3445.64s] get weakness in the market maybe we&#39;ll
[3446.92s] have an opportunity to re-enter some of
[3448.319s] the bigger Banks then um typically IPOs
[3451.839s] outperform in both the short medium and
[3454.4s] long
[3455.28s] term uh so you see the first few months
[3458.119s] they do well and by so there&#39;s an
[3460.319s] opportunity to look at IPOs that are
[3462.52s] three years old and left for dead there
[3464.359s] were a ton of them in 2021s and and now
[3467.319s] a bunch of them are getting cheap enough
[3468.96s] that it&#39;s it is getting very interesting
[3470.68s] so that&#39;s going to be an area of focus
[3474.119s] um next old economy sector stand to
[3477.24s] benefit most from regulatory
[3481.0s] laxity materials industrial consumer
[3483.839s] discretionary we&#39;re positioned for all
[3485.68s] of those uh growth for materials Tech
[3488.079s] and healthc care this is earnings growth
[3491.119s] for next year so materials again we got
[3493.559s] to pay attention to healthc care biotech
[3496.359s] Industrials consumer services Etc uh
[3499.92s] opportunities there goods and services
[3501.92s] consumption remain depressed but is
[3503.68s] likely bottoming this is going to be
[3505.68s] great for for the likes of um the gooses
[3509.88s] of the world the van the VF corpse of
[3512.24s] the world
[3513.44s] Etc uh including the mag 7 consensus
[3516.24s] expects just 2.5% volume growth in 2025
[3519.28s] against easy comp of just plus five uh.
[3523.559s] five% in 2024 so there was basically a
[3526.68s] retail and consumer you know mini
[3528.799s] recession in 2024 that probably uh
[3532.24s] troughed in uh this most quarter that&#39;s
[3535.839s] just been reported and we&#39;ll re
[3538.44s] accelerate in Q4 I think we&#39;re going to
[3540.079s] have a solid holiday
[3542.52s] season and uh a lot of those retailers
[3545.64s] and consumer discretionary names are
[3547.2s] going to do better than people expected
[3548.92s] after a soft Q3 with the weakness into
[3552.319s] the election uh anticipating and you can
[3554.68s] see the expected growth moving forward
[3557.0s] consumer services Health Care uh real
[3560.559s] estate utilities
[3562.24s] Etc volume growth since hiking cycle has
[3565.599s] been negative but demand recovery equals
[3567.799s] margin expansion we&#39;re seeing that
[3570.68s] materials Industrials and Tech are
[3572.4s] expected to drive the biggest margin
[3573.839s] expansion in
[3575.039s] 2025 same story the worst of the
[3577.599s] inventory destocking cycle is likely
[3579.359s] behind us again for those of you think
[3581.359s] you missed it it&#39;s just starting we&#39;re
[3584.599s] kind of at the 2010 level uh and the
[3588.68s] 2002 level and you had many more years
[3591.28s] of rally Runway and if you think about
[3593.48s] it in terms of cars uh its early days of
[3597.799s] the recovery of volumes semis and Autos
[3600.359s] saw the biggest decline days sales of
[3603.2s] inventory year on year by S&amp;P across
[3605.319s] sectors this is going to reverse easing
[3608.76s] rate pressure should TR translate into
[3610.96s] pickup in manufacturing we agree uh mag
[3614.16s] 7 earnings are expected to slow while
[3615.96s] other 493 are expected to accelerate
[3617.839s] we&#39;ve been saying this is coming for the
[3619.119s] last six months it has come it is going
[3621.28s] to accelerate through
[3622.839s] 2025 indicator suggests 14% year on year
[3626.319s] EPS growth in Q4 versus 9% consensus
[3630.0s] that&#39;s a big deal we did 5.8% relative
[3633.079s] to 4.2% in Q3 we&#39;re going to jump in Q4
[3637.039s] to uh 14% so selling stocks before the
[3640.559s] end of the year when no one has a reason
[3642.48s] to because they don&#39;t want to book the
[3643.799s] taxes and anticipating great earnings
[3646.799s] results for Q4 you don&#39;t want to be a
[3648.799s] seller probably through late January or
[3651.72s] February if you want to take profits
[3653.24s] take them then corporate Mis by the way
[3656.16s] all this is opinion not advice um uh go
[3660.079s] to hedge fund tips.com click on terms
[3662.48s] talk to your financial
[3664.72s] advisor Etc corporate misery index
[3667.76s] remains
[3669.48s] weak uh yeah week just like 2001 before
[3673.52s] biggest move in the shortest amount of
[3675.0s] time week just like 2009 week just like
[3678.44s] 1991 week just like 1982 you want to buy
[3682.119s] when the corporate misery indicator
[3683.88s] remains weak you don&#39;t want to buy when
[3685.559s] it&#39;s at the peak necessarily so uh labor
[3688.92s] productivity we covered that break out
[3690.839s] domestic investment is picking up after
[3692.52s] 10 years of under
[3695.16s] Investments mentions of reshoring
[3697.2s] increased sharply off the charts
[3699.079s] construction spent on manufacturing
[3700.599s] sword in recent
[3702.28s] years interest rates coming off 5,000
[3705.16s] year lows yeah not fivey year 5,000 year
[3708.28s] lows uh rate cycl can last for four
[3710.68s] years so people are trying to
[3711.64s] extrapolate this is going to go up and
[3712.88s] up and up it&#39;s not going to go up and up
[3714.72s] and up because
[3716.48s] uh population in the developed world is
[3718.96s] is flatlining this is going to remain
[3721.16s] subdued you get these Spike UPS like in
[3724.0s] 1895 back when I was only three years
[3726.559s] old I&#39;m just joking uh and then it
[3728.96s] spikes back down but in the 18 1800s you
[3731.64s] saw tons of these uh there was one
[3734.319s] example here in 1930 to
[3738.319s] 1968 where it went straight up uh I
[3741.16s] don&#39;t think you&#39;re going to see a repeat
[3742.279s] of that because we&#39;ve got too much debt
[3744.279s] we first need to bring the debt to GDP
[3746.2s] down which we will we&#39;ll grow our way
[3748.119s] out of it which Bin&#39;s 3x3 plan let me
[3751.72s] see if I can remember this
[3754.92s] uh bring the budget deficit down to
[3758.76s] 3% um budget deficit three million more
[3762.88s] barrels of oil and they&#39;re going to
[3765.559s] bring the budget deficit
[3768.64s] down through um through the Doge cuts
[3772.799s] and through other other factors and they
[3775.599s] want to run real GDP hot which has been
[3779.52s] the Playbook that I&#39;ve been talking
[3780.68s] about post World War II why I love
[3782.16s] bessent because he&#39;s a student of
[3783.92s] History like I am like we are he
[3787.16s] understands the postor War II Playbook
[3789.039s] which I said they&#39;re going to run this
[3790.119s] Playbook I thought I thought Powell
[3791.72s] would figure it out Bon&#39;s going to be
[3793.319s] the guy to do it just like minutian knew
[3795.079s] the Playbook and they&#39;re going to run
[3797.52s] inflation and they&#39;re going to run uh
[3800.119s] nominal growth through the roof the next
[3802.039s] few years and that debt to GDP is going
[3804.079s] to start to collapse from 122 to down to
[3807.76s] uh below 100 and then beyond like from
[3809.96s] 1948 to 19 uh 56 went it went from 120
[3814.76s] down to 63 inflation ran 3 to 5% nominal
[3818.359s] growth was was high single digits and
[3821.319s] we&#39;re going to see that type of
[3822.44s] environment and bessent knows the
[3824.039s] Playbook so that&#39;s his 3x3 plan perfect
[3826.72s] pick kudos to the administration for
[3828.359s] getting that
[3830.119s] right more than one in three Russell
[3832.88s] companies is unprofitable they say that
[3835.0s] like like it&#39;s a bad thing when&#39;s the
[3837.44s] last time you saw that was in 2010 you
[3839.319s] wanted to be a buyer of small caps you
[3841.52s] saw it in 2001 when you had the biggest
[3844.119s] rally in the shortest amount of time in
[3846.0s] small caps history and they&#39;re saying
[3847.88s] that like it&#39;s a bad thing it&#39;s a great
[3850.119s] thing that&#39;s what you see at the
[3851.039s] beginning of every small cap cycle uh

[3905.96s] in decades uh price to sales haven&#39;t
[3908.64s] been this low since 2001 these are just
[3911.119s] you get these opportunities once or
[3912.599s] twice in a career and everyone&#39;s at the
[3914.119s] wheel you know sleeping and trying to
[3916.079s] chase the the momo stocks that they&#39;re
[3917.88s] going to get their faces ripped off and
[3919.48s] and lose 80% of their money uh
[3922.319s] accelerating profits growth would
[3923.96s] historically favor value
[3926.76s] uh we expect earnings to accelerate in

[3931.92s] above average on a three-month basis
[3933.68s] same with midcap small caps remain

[3944.839s] that materials narrative free cash flow
[3947.76s] yield is yes less compelling than it
[3950.2s] once
[3952.319s] was it&#39;s higher it&#39;s still higher it&#39;s

[3967.359s] not a better opportunity since 2009 and

[3980.279s] happening and then macro cycle set to
[3983.76s] shift from recovery in 2024 to Boom in

[3990.4s] in the business all this cash and money
[3992.359s] market 6.2 trillion has to put to work
[3995.319s] and they talk about bubbles over the

[4010.279s] 2000s China in the mid 2000s biotech in
[4013.799s] 2014
[4016.039s] uh uh Bitcoin came down Arc was a big
[4020.279s] bubble in 21 Fang and magnificent 7 so
[4023.76s] there you go ladies and gentlemen that&#39;s
[4025.4s] a lot of data for a holiday
[4029.4s] week fed odds we
[4031.76s] got merging markets we got November 2024
[4035.88s] Auto Sale US Auto Sales showing signs of
[4038.4s] progress thanks to my buddy who sent
[4039.96s] that over uh basically what they&#39;re
[4042.279s] saying is November is up to 1 .31 units
[4046.559s] a growth of 6% from the year ago level
[4049.92s] that&#39;s with record high interest rates
[4051.4s] wait till rates continue to come down um
[4054.4s] credit is is starting to flow and that
[4057.079s] translates into uh a 15.9 million SAR in
[4061.279s] November on Trend with the 16 million
[4064.4s] unit Mark realized in
[4068.839s] October so remember everyone was
[4071.0s] pessimistic after September it bounced
[4072.72s] right
[4073.92s] back never order this pricey cut of meat
[4076.72s] at a steakhouse New York Chefs say
[4079.319s] here&#39;s the one to try it instead so
[4082.039s] they&#39;re saying avoid the fan they&#39;ve got
[4084.039s] to put you know I&#39;m a steak guy they
[4086.079s] have to put all these sauces on to make
[4087.4s] it taste good get the bone and rib eye
[4089.72s] ladies and gentlemen I I learned that
[4091.24s] not from this article for many years of
[4093.2s] eating steak but I also want to thank my
[4095.119s] buddies Isaac and Jacob uh when we
[4098.359s] they&#39;ve been long time uh listeners and
[4100.48s] Friends Etc uh we went out to steak
[4103.679s] dinner together and uh this was a few
[4105.839s] years ago now and they&#39;re like you got
[4107.799s] to get the bone and ribey I was like the
[4109.12s] ribeye really it&#39;s like that&#39;s not like
[4110.56s] a lower cut I would always get the
[4112.0s] Porter House on the bone and the whole
[4113.279s] thing it&#39;s so much more tasty so for
[4116.0s] those of you uh who have been eating too
[4118.159s] many vegetables order yourself a bone
[4120.56s] and ribeye and live the dream uh fed
[4123.08s] Williams sees inflation Cooling and
[4124.719s] interest rates falling further we like
[4126.52s] the story on that that&#39;s confirmed by
[4128.44s] the December uh odds billionaire
[4131.56s] investor Howard marks is snapping up
[4133.88s] quote uninvestable Chinese assets legend
[4137.88s] in the business no one wants it he&#39;s
[4139.679s] going in and and uh and doing it how I
[4142.6s] learned to stop worrying about the
[4143.92s] national debt even though it&#39;s 35
[4145.719s] trillion this is an article in the New
[4147.799s] York Post by Ken Fischer and he goes
[4149.48s] through all the data and inflation
[4150.92s] adjustments Etc it&#39;s worth reading um
[4154.0s] I&#39;m not comfortable with it because I
[4155.92s] I&#39;m comfortable with it not for the
[4157.12s] reasons that he lays out but he does lay
[4159.759s] out good reasons in terms of the the
[4161.88s] servicing and how they&#39;re going to deal
[4163.4s] with that uh
[4166.0s] I&#39;m excited because Bon&#39;s going to run
[4167.52s] the post World War II Playbook and bring
[4169.319s] that ratio down bond market Hal halts
[4171.92s] brutal run as buyers pounce on 4.5%
[4174.6s] yields us treasuries rally on bets that
[4177.839s] bessent will soften Trump&#39;s plans that
[4179.96s] and half the world is off sides on the
[4181.52s] bond trade this is super
[4185.08s] important the AI race is entering a new
[4187.719s] stage Nvidia won&#39;t be the only winner
[4189.839s] this
[4193.239s] time okay now
[4196.48s] why is that important ladies and
[4201.48s] gentlemen we are see okay at some point
[4205.96s] ai&#39;s emphasis will shift from training
[4209.56s] that&#39;s the large language models that
[4211.199s] take up all that compute power all that
[4212.84s] energy all the data centers to
[4216.36s] inference the process of generating
[4218.8s] answers from results from the model so
[4220.56s] the models will be built that&#39;s the
[4221.96s] capital intensive phase
[4226.48s] many in the industry now believe that
[4228.04s] dedicating more Computing C power to
[4230.6s] inference can provide similar benefits
[4232.84s] to training it&#39;s cheaper less energy
[4235.84s] different type of chips what we are
[4238.4s] seeing we are seeing the emergence of a
[4240.679s] new scaling law with inference time
[4243.76s] compute nadela said at Microsoft&#39;s
[4246.4s] ignite conference the inference Focus
[4250.36s] has big implications for NVIDIA while
[4253.92s] training is uniquely suited for the
[4256.199s] company&#39;s
[4257.4s] gpus inference might be more readily
[4261.08s] handled by AI processors from Nvidia
[4263.56s] peers like Advanced Micro Devices and
[4268.159s] and
[4270.28s] Intel Intel ladies and gentlemen Intel
[4274.08s] Intel buy custom chips from Amazon or
[4277.199s] buy a range of Chip
[4279.08s] startups um this is huge because you&#39;re
[4282.8s] going to start to hear more and more
[4284.88s] from these hyperscalers talking about
[4287.0s] inference versus training the models
[4289.159s] training the models Nvidia wins
[4291.64s] inference Intel wins and this game is
[4294.76s] just beginning and it&#39;s going to be part
[4296.64s] driven by cost part driven by energy
[4299.239s] part driven by efficiency part driven by
[4301.88s] demands from shareholders for Returns on
[4304.159s] investments from the hyperscalers and
[4306.239s] we&#39;re going to move into the inference
[4307.48s] phase now that a lot of the language the
[4309.28s] model training
[4311.199s] is the majority is done there&#39;ll be more
[4313.84s] model training of course but the
[4315.6s] inference is where they&#39;re going to get
[4316.96s] the value for their Investments and
[4319.04s] Intel is going to be there to service
[4320.719s] that demand that is just getting started
[4323.52s] by the way they got their $8 billion
[4325.4s] from the government which is awesome
[4327.08s] stimulus
[4328.28s] rumors
[4331.719s] as insurance companies told to buy
[4334.52s] stocks this is China this is from my
[4336.04s] friend Brendan Ahern over at kweb uh and
[4340.12s] what he&#39;s saying is the chatter is that
[4342.32s] the China economic work Council which
[4344.88s] usually takes place in mid December will
[4347.84s] will occur in early December with
[4350.8s] further speculation that the fiscal
[4352.88s] deficit will be expanded from the
[4355.52s] 2024&#39;s 3% to 4.5% hopefully the rumors
[4359.199s] are true one factor that likely
[4361.32s] contributed significantly was a release
[4364.12s] from Lee yunzi of the state
[4366.84s] Administration for financial regulation
[4369.8s] stating that the insurance industry
[4372.159s] should quote increase investment in
[4375.52s] areas such as strategic emerging
[4377.56s] Industries Advanced manufacturing and
[4379.719s] new infrastructure as an FYI you will
[4382.12s] only read about this here uh this would
[4384.8s] explain why the mainland&#39;s pure
[4386.12s] technology play the starboard gained
[4388.239s] 3.61% versus the partial technology
[4390.48s] shenzhen&#39;s gain of 2.07% and the
[4392.96s] technology light shanghai&#39;s gain of
[4396.679s] 1.53% insurance companies putting money
[4398.88s] to work would help stem the stock
[4400.36s] market&#39;s recent slide after ripping post
[4402.199s] stimulus announcement remember L Hefe
[4404.52s] said the stock Market is higher through
[4406.28s] Mainland margin balances have fallen
[4408.239s] significantly insurance companies are
[4410.12s] being told to buy stock to buy the stock
[4412.76s] market would help interestingly the
[4415.0s] national team&#39;s favored ETF had below
[4417.48s] average volumes again so this is from
[4419.6s] Brandon aharn giving us the inside scoop
[4421.52s] which is why we read him every day and
[4423.8s] uh great work there Haider Akerman
[4426.239s] releases his first snow goose by Canada
[4429.159s] Goose capsule collection right here is
[4431.639s] Ethan Hawk in the Ryder Parker these are
[4434.56s] cool
[4435.639s] because like um I like the fact that the
[4439.44s] Canada Goose thing is the same color as
[4441.32s] the jacket so it&#39;s more like hidden and
[4444.52s] they&#39;re going with the original for
[4445.88s] those of you who don&#39;t know Canada Goose
[4447.28s] has been around since 1957 it was hot
[4450.04s] before Drake was hot and it&#39;ll be hot
[4451.88s] after Drake is forgotten and
[4455.719s] um for the US money managers that don&#39;t
[4458.239s] realize that this the the big game is in
[4460.36s] Asia on the Canada Goose and it will
[4462.36s] come back to the US with cool stuff like
[4464.159s] this so this was launched the 26th
[4467.48s] they&#39;re going to do they did they held
[4469.159s] back on Advertising the first two um
[4473.04s] fiscal quarters of the Year 2025 year
[4475.679s] they don&#39;t operate on a calendar
[4478.52s] quarter and uh so they&#39;re going to push
[4480.84s] this into the holiday season I think
[4482.639s] it&#39;s going to be huge home run right
[4484.44s] thing at the right time jet pick up the
[4487.199s] uh advertising spend and they&#39;re going
[4488.8s] to have a monster quarter so we&#39;ll talk
[4490.88s] about that in a little bit Trump says
[4492.92s] Mexico president has agreed to stop
[4494.52s] migrants Crossing into the us through
[4496.199s] her country very productive conversation
[4498.76s] we&#39;ll see how that plays out which means
[4500.52s] probably less tariffs than advertised
[4502.639s] China needs 1.4 trillion to boost
[4504.84s] domestic consumption amid impending
[4506.8s] trade War 2.0 so I think this is going
[4509.44s] to be a positive thing it&#39;s going to get
[4511.12s] maybe at this meeting that Brendan&#39;s
[4513.08s] talking about maybe it&#39;ll get them to do
[4514.84s] they did the 1.4
[4516.719s] trillion uh in an indirect way they need
[4520.199s] to do it in a consumer way and maybe
[4522.719s] we&#39;ll see some of that in coming weeks
[4525.56s] uh last trump point1 it took till till
[4527.84s] after January 1st before the
[4529.84s] inauguration for China to start to take
[4531.84s] off maybe this time will be a little
[4533.92s] different rhyming but uh maybe a little
[4536.04s] bit early we&#39;ll see Intel received 7.9
[4539.32s] billion in chips sa funding they finally
[4541.08s] got that that is
[4542.52s] huge turkey or Goose stock market and
[4545.88s] sentiment results uh here&#39;s my buddy and
[4548.36s] client Damian on his uh snowmobile and I
[4551.96s] decided to put this as the um
[4555.239s] uh article of the week photo because he
[4557.679s] was wearing his Canada Goose Parker here
[4561.08s] and he said he was in 20 degree weather
[4563.08s] in Utah uh he&#39;s built a great
[4565.52s] unbelievable real estate business in
[4567.04s] California he was in Utah 20 degree
[4569.239s] weather going 20 30 miles an hour on his
[4572.0s] snowmobile he said he was warm as warm
[4574.44s] could be best jacket in the business uh
[4577.4s] okay so we covered that covered
[4579.84s] that uh here we go uh I&#39;ll be a little
[4583.199s] informal today since it&#39;s a holiday and
[4585.4s] all so here it goes while there&#39;s a
[4587.56s] sizable contingent of family offices
[4589.84s] ultra high net worth business people and
[4591.76s] investment professionals that listen to
[4593.679s] my podcast every week there&#39;s also a
[4595.48s] very large group of young listeners who
[4597.8s] have helped push my podcast to the top
[4599.88s] of the charts in the hedge fund
[4603.6s] category in my weekly podcast video cast
[4606.679s] not only do we talk about companies and
[4608.48s] economic data but I try to share some
[4610.88s] career and life lessons I&#39;ve learned
[4612.679s] along the way to be helpful to
[4616.0s] so the one one thing I&#39;ve learned is
[4619.159s] that you&#39;re going to come across two
[4621.12s] types of people in the path towards your
[4623.199s] goals the first is the phony type who
[4625.96s] are waiting to see you make mistakes or
[4627.92s] slip up and will be quick to point them
[4630.36s] out and the second type of friends uh
[4632.8s] who are going to try to help you and are
[4634.44s] rooting for you every single step of the
[4636.36s] way I&#39;ve aimed to not only be part of
[4638.96s] the latter group be that type of friend
[4641.52s] but recognize and befriend those who
[4643.52s] display similar characteristics
[4645.76s] part of the secret to success quote
[4647.4s] unquote is to avoid or disassociate from
[4650.44s] the former and to befriend and nurture
[4653.08s] relationships with the latter the old
[4655.36s] cliche is 100% true quote you become who
[4658.96s] you hang around I&#39;m blessed to have
[4660.96s] great family friends and business
[4663.04s] partners in my life and on this day
[4664.84s] Thanksgiving my favorite holiday uh of
[4668.36s] the year I wanted to
[4670.96s] acknowledge uh
[4676.04s] I wanted to acknowledge one friend who
[4677.84s] embodies what I&#39;m describing above so
[4680.96s] yesterday I quote unquote caught my
[4683.44s] buddy Lou Bassin on Cavuto Coast to
[4686.679s] Coast on Fox Business yesterday giving
[4688.92s] me a shout out on Disney and I wanted to
[4692.4s] point this out because it&#39;s very rare
[4694.679s] for someone to point out the ones that
[4696.44s] work people are quick to point out the
[4698.44s] ones that take longer and uh give us a
[4700.92s] tough time but lose a different kind of
[4703.44s] guy and everyone knows it A+ in my book
[4706.08s] it really doesn&#39;t get any better than
[4707.4s] Lou uh so I&#39;m going to play the short
[4709.199s] clip here how badly does Disney need Mo
[4711.96s] 2 to be a hit like Deadpool and
[4713.239s] Wolverine look I got to be
[4714.76s] intellectually honest in August of 23 I
[4716.84s] called Disney a dumpster fire for
[4718.679s] Capital and I wasn&#39;t wrong it really was
[4720.88s] when Bob AER came on but after suffering
[4723.28s] 11 billion of losses they&#39;ve turned
[4724.8s] around the streaming they&#39;re starting to
[4726.159s] make profits strong growth they&#39;ve had
[4728.12s] big hits Moana too this could add uh
[4730.8s] significantly to their profitability I
[4732.639s] think they absolutely need the momentum
[4734.44s] to continue in this business uh the
[4736.52s] thing that&#39;s always kept me away from
[4738.12s] Disney is that it&#39;s so consumer based
[4740.4s] and driven and right now at a time when
[4741.84s] the consumer is very strap but that
[4743.639s] being said if you look this stock has
[4745.28s] definitely bottomed out I got to give
[4746.48s] credit to my friend and Wall Street
[4748.04s] colleague Tom Hayes from great Hill
[4750.0s] Capital he&#39;s picked this bottom early
[4751.56s] and been right uh I think there&#39;s much
[4753.4s] more room that Disney can go under Bob
[4755.96s] Iger and I think there is a there is a
[4757.76s] window right he is going to step down in
[4761.4s] 2026 and we&#39;re back uh Lou president and
[4765.159s] chief Market strategist at MDB Capital
[4768.32s] so you can click there and see all about
[4769.92s] him and and what they do uh over at MDB
[4773.159s] very interesting story and a lot of you
[4775.32s] could probably benefit from what he does
[4777.159s] as well uh goose cooked or Goose loose
[4781.52s] the featured picture is another friend
[4783.76s] and client Damian from Los Angeles who
[4785.4s] built an amazing real estate business in
[4786.96s] California he posted a picture and I
[4789.239s] thought it was the perfect header for
[4790.32s] this week&#39;s note given the fact that he
[4791.84s] happened to have a Canada Goose jacket
[4793.28s] on unlike Lou who likes to highlight my
[4796.04s] winners for those of you who have been
[4797.92s] around the podcast videoast for some
[4799.76s] time you know I spend 80% or more time
[4801.88s] on the Holdings that have yet to take
[4803.679s] off and less than 20% of the time on the
[4806.199s] ones that are and were home runs Canada
[4809.239s] Goose falls into the former
[4811.12s] category uh our basis across all
[4813.48s] accounts is a little little over $111 a
[4815.88s] share this was a growth story that
[4817.92s] turned into a value story when we
[4819.639s] initiated and has a chance to turn back
[4821.8s] into a growth story if they execute on
[4824.36s] their plan and catch a little Tailwind
[4826.92s] in the Asia recovery as well as
[4828.48s] cyclicality they&#39;ve been through these
[4830.04s] Cycles many year many times since they
[4832.36s] started in
[4835.76s] 1957 so while it is still a small
[4839.12s] position for us I&#39;m looking for Windows
[4841.12s] that will make sense to upssize it into
[4843.28s] a full-size holding as the data confirms
[4846.199s] the original Outlook and thesis we&#39;ve
[4848.159s] been modestly topping up on weakness but
[4850.88s] have yet to lean in with a cannon so far
[4853.679s] we may never do it but I think uh we&#39;ll
[4856.159s] be paying close attention to
[4857.92s] opportunities as the data comes
[4861.52s] in so 10 key points from Canada Goose
[4865.32s] November 7th earnings results and
[4867.84s] call first off Revenue uh 192 million
[4872.12s] beat Expectations by 7.86 despite a 4.9%
[4876.08s] year-over-year decline uh EPS estimate
[4879.04s] beat estimates a company expanded its
[4881.679s] permanent store count to 72 locations if
[4883.96s] you remember from the long-term plan was
[4886.679s] to grow the DTC and reduce the wholesale
[4889.36s] inventory levels decreased by 9% uh net
[4893.56s] debt was decreased by about 25 million
[4897.0s] spring and summer collection was well
[4898.92s] received indicating potential for a
[4900.639s] robust annual lineup not just the heavy
[4903.96s] down lines e-commerce traffic increase
[4907.28s] suggesting growing online interest in
[4908.96s] the brand companies broadening its
[4910.679s] product range with plans to launch an
[4912.52s] eyewear line uh positive Trends have
[4915.679s] been observed in the Chinese market
[4917.6s] particularly during events like golden
[4919.679s] week and singles day the company&#39;s
[4921.44s] focusing on expanding the non-
[4923.28s] heavyweight down categories and
[4924.6s] diversifying into non-seasonal app
[4926.239s] Parable which could lead to yearr round
[4929.199s] Revenue opportunities the Cornerstone in
[4931.76s] other words the business is very
[4932.92s] cyclical I&#39;m going to show you the data
[4935.4s] and you&#39;ll
[4937.08s] see cornerstones of the turnaround plan
[4939.6s] are twofold reduce the wholesale and two
[4942.6s] make up the difference with broader
[4944.0s] product off offering and more DTC stores
[4946.08s] and high margin
[4948.199s] opportunities the expected long-term
[4951.04s] benefits of the DTC plan for Canada
[4953.36s] Goose include higher profit margins by
[4955.6s] eliminating intermediaries Canada Goose
[4957.56s] can capture a larger sale of the retail
[4959.56s] price leading to improved profitability
[4961.84s] over time enhanced brand control the DTC
[4964.28s] model allows Canada Goose to take
[4966.0s] greater control of its brand narrative
[4968.08s] and product
[4971.12s] distribution improve consumer engagement
[4973.56s] by the way it&#39;s interesting
[4975.52s] you&#39;re seeing this because I ordered um
[4979.0s] that
[4980.239s] um uh Canada Goose vest uh yesterday I
[4984.6s] you couldn&#39;t really find any Black
[4986.239s] Friday deals and all the Black Friday
[4987.679s] started a week ago because it&#39;s a
[4989.28s] shorter holiday season uh so they have
[4991.639s] controlled their price there were no
[4992.8s] real discounts online and I like that
[4994.92s] because their margins are going to
[4995.96s] continue to stay
[4997.719s] high uh reduced wholesale presence
[4999.96s] allows for dependency less dependency on
[5002.52s] markdowns often seen in wholesale
[5004.08s] partners ship better Inventory
[5006.199s] management the shift to DDC enables more
[5008.44s] efficient inventory control as evidenced
[5010.92s] by the 9% decrease in inventory levels
[5014.0s] valuable consumer insights direct
[5016.28s] interaction with customers provides data
[5018.199s] that can inform product development and
[5019.719s] marketing strategies increased
[5021.4s] operational efficiency as Canada Goose
[5023.239s] optimizes DTC operations it may benefit
[5026.08s] from economies to scale in retail and
[5027.76s] e-commerce channels Global expansion
[5030.0s] opportunities the DTC model facilitates
[5032.56s] easier entry into new markets particular
[5034.56s] Ally through e-commerce enhanc customer
[5036.96s] lifetime value a strong DTC presence can
[5038.96s] potentially increase brand loyalty and
[5041.199s] customer retention agility and product
[5042.88s] offering direct sales allow for quicker
[5044.36s] adaptation to market trends and consumer
[5046.44s] preferences at the end of the day that&#39;s
[5049.96s] just a bunch of words the numbers tell
[5053.239s] the whole story which is why on golf
[5055.92s] cards they make the box so small so you
[5058.28s] can&#39;t fit in the story just the number
[5062.8s] price is what you pay value is what you
[5065.6s] get while free cash flow has materially
[5068.52s] recovered price has remained subdued I
[5072.04s] built my career on capturing divergences
[5074.96s] like this and you can see free cash flow
[5077.96s] trailing 12 months accelerating when
[5080.239s] that happens historically what happens
[5082.48s] the price follows recovery in cash flow
[5085.96s] price follows recovery and cash flow
[5088.6s] price not following yet and will follow
[5091.119s] revenues continue to
[5092.84s] climb return on invested capital is
[5095.239s] still high single digits despite that we
[5097.08s] are in a trough recovery cycle
[5099.36s] destocking turning into restocking as
[5101.88s] the inventory management under control
[5103.679s] with reducing wholesalers gross margin
[5106.119s] still at 68% which is an unbelievable
[5109.119s] business and uh and then I want to get
[5112.48s] into more granular numbers and as I like
[5115.119s] to as I say on this uh article this is
[5119.44s] the Farah facet of financial pictures in
[5123.28s] my view and if you&#39;re under 40 years old
[5125.6s] and don&#39;t get the reference just Google
[5127.44s] Farah faucet and here&#39;s a lovely picture
[5130.4s] of Farah faucet uh from Charlie&#39;s Angels
[5134.28s] and um and and as lovely as that picture
[5136.92s] is the value line financials for the
[5140.32s] last decade are even more lovely than
[5142.8s] that beautiful smile H in that the sales
[5146.239s] per share continue to go up the cash
[5148.04s] flow per share continues to go up the
[5149.88s] earnings per share continue to go up the
[5152.239s] sales continue to go up the operating
[5155.0s] margin what the only thing that has gone
[5156.679s] down is the price and we believe that
[5160.92s] that will start to play catchup look
[5162.76s] it&#39;s not all peaches and cream revenues
[5164.239s] were down 4% year on year but this is a
[5166.84s] cyclical enough business that you have
[5168.56s] to accept and
[5170.199s] trust that they will figure it out as
[5173.04s] they&#39;ve done since
[5175.04s] 1957 anytime you find yourself in a
[5177.88s] situation where the financials continue
[5179.6s] to recover and improve and the price
[5181.52s] continues to decline count your lucky
[5184.32s] blessings Mr Market is serving up one of
[5186.679s] his manic bouts to deliver you an
[5189.199s] opportunity to benefit from a rare
[5191.28s] Divergence in dislocation if you don&#39;t
[5193.239s] understand the manic nature of Mr Market
[5196.08s] read the intelligent investor by
[5198.199s] Benjamin Graham uh Warren Buffett&#39;s
[5200.76s] favorite book changed my life in the
[5203.36s] case of Canada
[5205.08s] Goose North American money managers
[5207.96s] think it&#39;s over because Drake lost his
[5210.92s] Canada Goose jacket while they miss the
[5213.239s] fact that sales are doubling in certain
[5215.4s] parts of Asia and the amount of cash the
[5217.76s] business generates per share has never
[5219.84s] been higher or cheaper to purchase an
[5222.239s] interest in price is what you pay value
[5225.0s] is what you get as we know Goose
[5227.199s] generates the Lion Share of its revenue
[5229.32s] and profits in the fourth qu calendar
[5232.48s] quarter of the year due to the holidays
[5235.56s] they also have held back on normal
[5237.6s] marketing spend this year to focus on
[5239.84s] this quarter&#39;s launch of the first
[5241.4s] seasonal capsule collection from new
[5243.56s] creative dor Haider aurman designed
[5246.92s] under the Brand&#39;s Heritage label snow
[5249.679s] goose and there&#39;s Ethan Hawk and here is
[5252.76s] the cyclicality of the business this is
[5255.159s] going to change now that they&#39;re getting
[5256.88s] into lightwear it&#39;s not going to be so
[5259.239s] dependent on the fourth quarter cold
[5261.119s] winter and holiday season but you can
[5262.52s] see going back to 2016 the story is the
[5265.52s] same every year uh they they basically
[5268.239s] do nothing uh up until the third quarter
[5271.6s] calendar quarter they start to ramp and
[5273.679s] the fourth quarter they shoot the lights
[5275.28s] out fourth quarter they shoot the lights
[5276.6s] out that&#39;s when they generate all the
[5277.92s] free cash flow and the same will be true
[5280.8s] this year as we see the spike up cash
[5283.719s] comes in everyone&#39;s happy and maybe
[5286.199s] accelerated by the ad spend and the big
[5288.6s] push of something new uh first time
[5291.0s] you&#39;re having something big new in the
[5292.639s] heavy down uh in a while and uh I think
[5295.8s] they&#39;re going to push this hard and I
[5297.159s] think it&#39;s going to be well
[5300.199s] received Haider aurman releases his
[5303.28s] first snow goose by Canada capsule
[5304.88s] collection we are going to know a lot
[5306.96s] more in 60 days if this was the hit they
[5309.32s] needed to reignite their heavyweight
[5311.0s] down part of the business I wouldn&#39;t bet
[5313.28s] against a 67y old brand of this caliber
[5315.88s] trading at these levels Canada Goose was
[5318.199s] big before Drake and will be big again
[5320.36s] before Drake is long forgotten in the
[5322.8s] meantime free cash flow is recovering
[5325.96s] nicely General market fear in greed&#39;s at
[5328.679s] 64 uh getting elevated but not yet
[5331.28s] extreme National Association of Act of
[5333.8s] invest managers pretty flatlined at 90%
[5336.84s] up there again not an extreme probably
[5338.76s] more room to run into end of year S&amp;P
[5341.44s] earnings basically revisions last 60
[5343.679s] days Flatline down 27 basis points
[5346.239s] Russell same story 55 basis points
[5349.4s] economic data we&#39;ve covered most of this
[5351.639s] earnings now starting to re accelerate
[5353.8s] estimates back up to 275 for next year
[5357.639s] and uh we&#39;re done with the podcast now
[5359.679s] we&#39;re going to do the ask me anything
[5361.639s] questions so for those of you who love
[5364.159s] you ask me anything stick around for
[5366.239s] those of you who don&#39;t we&#39;ll see you
[5367.8s] next week have a Happy Thanksgiving
[5370.0s] enjoy the football fun and
[5372.36s] family and here we go
[5375.639s] llan llan
[5377.8s] Neo Tom is this is more of a career
[5381.32s] question is the CFA useful to break into
[5383.36s] Finance how does one get into value
[5385.6s] investing career like yourself um yeah I
[5388.88s] think if you don&#39;t have any experience
[5390.52s] that&#39;s table Stakes so go get your CFA
[5393.84s] and if you&#39;re doing it to get a job save
[5396.08s] yourself time uh if you&#39;re doing it
[5398.32s] because you love it and you want to
[5399.92s] learn as much as possible as an
[5401.639s] investment in your future I would highly
[5403.679s] recommend that
[5406.239s] um next
[5409.36s] Eric first of all thanks for the amazing
[5411.48s] content you&#39;re putting out I can&#39;t find
[5413.0s] another podcast that even comes close as
[5416.6s] for the question of the week this is
[5418.96s] from sampy commas I okay um I know these
[5424.159s] are too large for you but Google and
[5426.76s] lvmh seem to me to be undervalued here
[5430.199s] valuations look good to me uh good cash
[5433.639s] flowing businesses with Good Financial
[5435.56s] Health that can perform great would love
[5437.08s] to hear your thoughts in any case thanks
[5439.04s] for so much for all the content you&#39;re
[5440.6s] putting out all right sampy thank you
[5442.92s] for writing in um you&#39;re probably newer
[5446.44s] so um you don&#39;t know our Google history
[5450.679s] but we were massive buyers of Google in
[5453.199s] the whole in late
[5455.52s] 2022 and early 2023 when no one wanted
[5458.96s] it in the 80s and 90s and we took
[5461.28s] profits this summer uh with more than a
[5464.239s] double bag in that and now that&#39;s you
[5466.76s] know up here everyone&#39;s getting
[5468.639s] interested uh I&#39;m not going to argue
[5470.719s] with you on that but uh you know we have
[5474.0s] to book wins and we were happy to book
[5476.28s] it and we have no urgency to get back in
[5478.6s] especially when we&#39;re using chat GPT and
[5482.04s] perplexity and uh meta
[5484.8s] AI uh a lot more than we have
[5490.04s] been in um recent years so I think
[5494.36s] Google will be fine I just don&#39;t think I
[5496.32s] think the opportunity would to buy it
[5498.0s] was when no one wanted it not when
[5499.679s] everyone wanted it as it relates to
[5502.36s] lvmh I think you&#39;re spot on but we have
[5506.8s] enough um consumer
[5512.44s] exposure and
[5516.119s] China exposure which this is basically
[5518.96s] just a play on the China recovery which
[5521.159s] we have through goose and Baba so um
[5525.76s] let&#39;s just take a look
[5529.84s] at
[5534.0s] here the
[5536.36s] financials all right so cash flow
[5538.36s] dropped it&#39;s recovering revenues gross
[5541.0s] margins same as goose 68% turn invested
[5544.4s] Capital so the stock&#39;s
[5547.08s] down about
[5551.88s] 40% I mean this is such a super high
[5554.32s] quality business that
[5559.159s] um I think you&#39;re going to be super
[5564.32s] right um but I think you might be a
[5567.199s] little bit
[5568.639s] early so
[5580.679s] yeah I I think you&#39;re probably okay with
[5582.76s] this I
[5586.04s] mean I think there are higher better
[5588.199s] uses for us but um I don&#39;t think you&#39;re
[5590.92s] wrong here I just think you got to wait
[5593.36s] a little longer than you think I I like
[5595.239s] that one better than Google to be honest
[5596.679s] with you um but not enough to get
[5600.92s] involved all right that&#39;s that
[5604.52s] Julian Julian
[5606.96s] Glock I see an increasing amount of
[5609.44s] people I follow expecting not only a
[5612.28s] pullback but rather a crash in q1 or Q2
[5614.84s] of 2025 as markets seem stretched
[5617.44s] melting up to them now I was of course
[5621.159s] wondering about your take on this and if
[5623.48s] it should come to that whether you would
[5625.32s] hold long-term positions through such
[5627.36s] times or are there moments when you
[5629.119s] would go entirely to cash uh okay good
[5632.52s] question number one
[5634.76s] is the people calling for crashes are
[5636.239s] the ones that missed the rally number
[5638.28s] two I do expect a pullback in the first
[5640.8s] quarter probably 8 to 10% probably
[5643.92s] around February completely guessing and
[5646.76s] because of that no we would not sell any
[5649.08s] of our long-term positions uh unless
[5651.96s] they were at or fully invalu
[5654.119s] irrespective of our guess about when the
[5656.639s] next correction is going to come I don&#39;t
[5659.32s] believe it&#39;ll be a crash I don&#39;t believe
[5660.84s] it&#39;ll be 20% I do think we&#39;re due for an
[5662.76s] 8 to 10%
[5665.36s] pullback and I don&#39;t think it&#39;s going to
[5667.36s] come until at least uh Late July January
[5670.199s] early February at the earliest uh or mid
[5673.36s] you know late late January February at
[5675.28s] the earliest and the way that we will
[5677.92s] potentially participate in that is we&#39;ll
[5679.76s] use part of our options bucket to hedge
[5682.04s] or fine tactical shorts in the short
[5684.56s] term and the only benefit of that is
[5686.8s] just dampening volatility and creating
[5688.52s] some excess cash to go long um but um no
[5692.92s] we don&#39;t we don&#39;t guess about when the
[5695.04s] Market&#39;s going to pull back and try to
[5696.48s] be nimble and and silly about that
[5699.32s] because going back to Peter Lynch&#39;s more
[5701.28s] money has been lost preparing for
[5702.56s] Corrections than the actual Corrections
[5704.119s] themselves number two we don&#39;t run High
[5705.8s] leverage so we just deal through the
[5707.119s] volatility it&#39;s like would you sell your
[5709.92s] jersey mics uh if you own 20 Jersey mics
[5713.84s] uh stores and you know some Economist
[5716.52s] said there was going to be a you know
[5718.719s] 20% pullback in the stock market
[5720.8s] therefore people are going to have less
[5722.08s] money to buy sandwiches or less consumer
[5724.119s] confidence so for the next six months
[5726.08s] sales are going to be down sell all your
[5728.0s] your franchises in the whole at low
[5730.44s] price no you would say if you&#39;re smart
[5733.239s] and you want to get rich you would say
[5734.8s] oh I wonder if any of my competitors are
[5737.28s] going to sell at lower multiples in the
[5739.159s] next six months when sales go down so I
[5741.0s] can have 40 stores instead of 10 stores
[5743.92s] and buy up those opportunities because
[5745.6s] when it comes back I&#39;ll make even more
[5747.159s] money that&#39;s the way to think about it
[5749.32s] not going to cash and all this nonsense
[5751.84s] and and pretending to predict the
[5753.239s] markets so uh hope that helps and um
[5757.239s] good question ad guard after the latest
[5761.239s] meltdown do you think target can be a
[5763.679s] good entry
[5765.48s] opportunity do you think an activist
[5768.04s] investor might be eminent there thanks
[5769.639s] for the amazing content well I think
[5773.0s] number one is they got to start catching
[5775.199s] criminals who who are stealing all their
[5777.08s] merchandise because
[5779.119s] somehow uh Walmart has not had the same
[5782.0s] problem number two
[5784.8s] uh stop offering ridiculous products to
[5787.199s] children but we&#39;ll leave that aside uh I
[5789.84s] don&#39;t think that&#39;s the
[5791.119s] core I well I wouldn&#39;t count against it
[5794.159s] but let&#39;s just let&#39;s just focus on the
[5796.04s] numbers here
[5798.08s] um so you&#39;re seeing a
[5800.84s] Slowdown uh and you&#39;re seeing it
[5802.639s] reflected in the stock price both in
[5804.48s] free cash flow revenues
[5807.639s] stalling um I think they&#39;ve become a me
[5810.6s] too Rea retailer their G gross margins
[5813.679s] haven&#39;t recovered
[5815.52s] yet uh they don&#39;t have anything exciting
[5818.239s] or fresh is really what it comes down to
[5820.719s] I think they&#39;ve gotten
[5822.36s] sidetracked uh and I don&#39;t think that
[5825.48s] this is one I want to rush into just
[5831.119s] yet
[5833.28s] um and I think retailers if you remember
[5836.119s] from our last few podcast did poorly
[5839.0s] after the inauguration in Trump
[5842.239s] 1 um
[5847.719s] I think there will be a time to get
[5849.04s] involved I just think it&#39;s nowhere near
[5851.88s] ready yet um send it back in if it gets
[5855.44s] below 100 I&#39;ll take another
[5858.199s] look moving
[5861.8s] on Peter Webster here&#39;s one for your
[5864.76s] Emerging Markets banko Colombia is a
[5866.88s] well-run bank paying 10.4% dividends
[5869.32s] like Argentina there is an uplift if
[5871.84s] there&#39;s a change in government CIB I&#39;m
[5874.44s] told is the best bank in Columbia Pete
[5877.239s] okay Pete well thanks for that I don&#39;t
[5878.84s] think there&#39;s a question there um I
[5881.639s] don&#39;t bet on potential changes in
[5883.239s] government and I don&#39;t tend to trust
[5886.719s] double
[5887.679s] digigit uh dividends staying intact it
[5891.639s] may prove to be correct but just taking
[5896.32s] a brief look this is already had a big
[5897.92s] run off the bottom uh it&#39;s a little late
[5899.96s] for my liking Greg altimari
[5905.32s] uh thanks for your input on oxy please
[5906.8s] take a look at di diio we own diio we
[5910.04s] like it it&#39;s going to be
[5911.96s] a bit of a track
[5914.32s] turnaround uh this is a new position for
[5917.679s] us we&#39;re not writing about it yet again
[5920.639s] this has China exposure this is going to
[5922.52s] benefit from Emerging Markets it did the
[5925.199s] exact same thing in when
[5928.28s] 2001 um so this is the best quality
[5932.0s] business yeah glp 1&#39;s have an impact but
[5934.32s] really this is a turnaround China
[5936.28s] recovery play and just looking at the
[5938.639s] numbers you can see that the stock price
[5941.239s] has overshot the
[5943.08s] deterioration in the financials they had
[5946.28s] a lot of pull forward during uh covid in
[5950.159s] terms of demand and now they&#39;re working
[5952.119s] through that and they had some issues in
[5953.84s] South America so prices come down with
[5956.239s] free cash flow revenues have been flat
[5958.159s] they need to re accelerate margins are
[5960.36s] holding up uh return on invested capital
[5964.239s] is solid continues to be double digits
[5967.08s] so this is just a waiting game it&#39;s the
[5968.84s] best game in town if you want to bet
[5970.48s] people will never drink again then you
[5972.56s] should get short the stock in the
[5974.76s] hole if you want to say people with you
[5978.96s] know people continue to like to
[5982.36s] escape you know I always tell my the one
[5985.08s] thing I like about what Trump did with
[5986.36s] his kids is no drinking no drugs no
[5989.48s] alcohol no tattoos there&#39;s nothing wrong
[5992.48s] with any of those stuff things in
[5993.88s] moderation I guess
[5995.76s] um
[5998.84s] uh but um the fact of the matter is
[6002.639s] since the beginning of time people have
[6004.239s] wanted to escape from reality and
[6006.28s] alcohol is one way they do it and glp
[6009.44s] ones or not glp ones I think they&#39;re
[6011.4s] still going to want to do it and I think
[6012.76s] diio is going to provide for that
[6014.28s] service so is it the investment that I&#39;m
[6016.76s] the most proud of in my life no uh but
[6020.36s] again I don&#39;t deal in ideology I deal in
[6022.76s] numbers and the fact is there&#39;s a demand
[6025.0s] in the marketplace for this there&#39;s
[6026.719s] going to be a continued demand there&#39;s a
[6028.28s] growing new middle class in emerging
[6030.84s] market that is growing like a weed that
[6034.159s] is going to get involved in this space
[6036.36s] and they&#39;re going to have celebrations
[6037.84s] and they&#39;re going to have social
[6039.0s] Gatherings and they&#39;re going to have uh
[6041.08s] even if they&#39;re drinking less they&#39;re
[6042.36s] going to be more people drinking and
[6044.08s] diio is positioned to benefit from that
[6046.28s] so uh let people be happy the way they
[6048.44s] want to be happy and uh and we&#39;ll be
[6051.08s] happy uh taking it all the way to the
[6052.84s] banks so uh we like diio and good one
[6056.92s] there and we own it uh n n deep
[6061.56s] basine thanks for everything you and
[6064.159s] your podcast have been a blessing uh for
[6066.44s] your restaurant play could the ticket
[6068.679s] Yelp qualify Tech play to cover overall
[6071.28s] eatout dollars rising over the next four
[6073.119s] years kind of off the- wall but love to
[6075.32s] hear your thoughts you thankfully
[6077.28s] butchered my last beyond meat
[6080.04s] suggestion
[6081.639s] exactly uh there we go
[6086.199s] um all right thanks Nate happy to do
[6089.8s] this one let&#39;s
[6092.119s] do
[6100.719s] Yelp this is a trading vehicle this has
[6103.239s] been a crap business that continues to
[6104.96s] trade in a Range let&#39;s see if anything
[6107.08s] is changed in the numbers that can
[6108.76s] change our
[6110.36s] mind um
[6123.84s] all right cash flows going up or had
[6126.0s] gone up price gone up revenues went up
[6128.48s] turn on Capital margins are
[6132.159s] down uh this is a tricky one my
[6137.199s] friend I&#39;d have to understand what the
[6140.599s] turnaround plan is and why it&#39;s
[6142.56s] sustainable why are the numbers modestly
[6147.239s] improving uh did they buy something did
[6150.4s] they consolidate the
[6152.88s] industry how&#39;s the balance
[6158.84s] sheet balance Sheet&#39;s
[6161.88s] great yeah the good news is you&#39;re
[6165.04s] probably right the bad news is it&#39;s
[6167.04s] probably only going to be a cyclical uh
[6168.8s] short-term trade uh back up to 50 but uh
[6172.52s] I hope I&#39;m wrong about that I think you
[6174.28s] got a good uh trade uh I don&#39;t think you
[6177.639s] have a good long-term
[6179.599s] business let&#39;s move to
[6182.32s] Jimbo
[6191.56s] uh all right so he&#39;s saying know I like
[6195.44s] your buy of etsy at
[6198.239s] $48 uh what&#39;s your Target price uh we&#39;re
[6201.08s] not going to publish that
[6203.96s] that&#39;s for our current because then
[6205.8s] people are going to try to front run our
[6207.28s] exit but I can tell you this
[6210.96s] that we don&#39;t get involved in any stock
[6215.199s] that we don&#39;t anticipate a double inside
[6217.239s] of three years uh and um some of them
[6221.52s] are have much more than a double and
[6224.119s] then when you add our options overlays
[6225.88s] they all have more than that uh so I
[6229.28s] would say no less than a double in three
[6231.199s] years and uh and on most of them a lot
[6234.639s] more and then certainly a lot more when
[6236.36s] you add in the option overlay so we&#39;ll
[6238.4s] leave it at that um
[6241.239s] Matt tumbo says I&#39;ve been in
[6248.92s] mmt uh yeah so that&#39;s something you&#39;ve
[6252.0s] been in congratulations on a good
[6254.04s] trade
[6256.36s] uh ack
[6260.159s] short okay so he just wanted to pat on
[6262.56s] the back great trades Matt awesome glad
[6264.8s] you&#39;re listening glad to be helpful
[6266.84s] David
[6267.84s] mlan
[6271.159s] uh he&#39;s asking about alibaba&#39;s B2B isn&#39;t
[6274.239s] it incred yes it&#39;s all incredible that&#39;s
[6276.159s] not going to be the primary mover it&#39;s
[6277.92s] going to be a contributor as the economy
[6280.36s] recovers Alibaba is the Tollgate for the
[6282.4s] China recovery so if you believe like
[6284.88s] every cycle they recover uh dollar gets
[6287.599s] weaker Emerging Markets fly and all the
[6289.719s] case that we&#39;ve made around that uh
[6291.56s] that&#39;s just going to be one of the
[6292.599s] factors that absolutely flies for
[6294.04s] Alibaba the only thing this time that&#39;s
[6295.84s] going to make it better than all the
[6296.84s] other times is they are the number one
[6298.8s] way to play AI in China uh most amount
[6301.44s] of value for the cheapest amount why
[6303.92s] because they have equity in every single
[6305.48s] AI startup in China because they just
[6307.8s] offer them compute Credit in exchange
[6309.639s] for equity and you&#39;re going to have
[6311.599s] things that you don&#39;t even know know you
[6313.599s] own as an Alibaba shareholder wind up
[6315.88s] being thousand Baggers and contributing
[6318.159s] materially to intrinsic value uh that&#39;s
[6320.88s] not even accounted for in addition to
[6323.56s] dominating uh uh Cloud compute AI
[6328.32s] e-commerce coming back when the middle
[6330.0s] class comes back and the higher end
[6331.639s] stuff comes in demand we&#39;re already
[6333.159s] seeing signs of that in the recent
[6334.52s] quarter as teu gets smashed and Alibaba
[6338.04s] uh maintains it share and starts to
[6340.4s] actually recover share uh and all of the
[6343.0s] international growth and all the things
[6344.4s] that they put in place so thanks for
[6346.0s] that Dave thank you for all the amazing
[6347.92s] AMA questions and people contributed
