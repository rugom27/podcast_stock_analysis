welcome to hedge fun tips with Tom Hayes I&#39;m Tom Hayes and this is your 254th videoast podcast for the week ending August 29 2024 we&#39;ll kick it off with some pictures and some family stuff then we&#39;ll get right down to it last week&#39;s podcast was absolutely incredible with special guest Brendan Ahern who runs the kweb China internet ETF if you didn&#39;t get a chance to listen to it over the weekend I would suggest you spend the time and listen to it Go On A Long Walk go on a long bike ride it was awesome this week I&#39;m going to try to cut that in more than half and do a short one because I know everyone wants to get away for the holidays but we do have a lot of important stuff to cover so we&#39;re going to get right down to it first and foremost want to let everyone know I&#39;m going to need a new admin that does all the posts on the blog every day the uh indicator of the day the where is money flowing uh on Thursdays you&#39;d be very busy doing all the syndication of the article of the week onto substack and talk markets and Seeking Alpha you basically copy and paste it onto LinkedIn uh uh and then the earnings reports uh by sector we teach you how to do that basically once you figure it all out it&#39;s literally 5 to seven hours a week uh you need to be around midday to do some of the live postings between 10: a.m. and 2 pm so probably ideal for maybe a work uh stay-at-home mom or uh someone younger who doesn&#39;t have a day job uh and I think you&#39;ll find it enjoyable and long lasting the people that I&#39;ve had had in that position have lasted a long time and they either go back to college or they go uh to a full-time job or whatever it happens to be but uh we&#39;re going to move on that so if you&#39;re interested and for all of you who applied for the video editor job uh first off we want to uh welcome Steve Frampton and um if you applied for that job and uh didn&#39;t get it then you will have significantly more weight if you apply for this gig and you can just click on contact enter your information we&#39;ll get back to you over the weekend and uh and get you started as early as Tuesday we have this pretty automated now you watch a few videos you&#39;ll know exactly what to do and Off to the Races so ah this is the boys we got out uh in New Jersey Kevin man had us out to his Club uh uh Rockaway in uh in Denville New Jersey Country Club which was awesome and you probably recognize these guys that&#39;s Kevin man he&#39;s on everything Fox Business CNBC Lou Bassin regular on vanney and Cavuto Mark Cher regular on mornings with Maria on Fox Business and uh vanney and then me uh so that was just a tremendous amount of fun this is at Yahoo finance that&#39;s the whole control Booth where all the magic happens on on Tuesday uh behind the scenes and that&#39;s that then we had over the weekend the girls got awards for high point for swimming uh high points for their age group uh for their team and that&#39;s Annabelle receiving her medal and that is an out of uh uh order picture but that&#39;s Caitlyn and I having date night while the girls were at Sleepaway Camp in Pennsylvania so that was fun we don&#39;t get to do that enough there was uh Yahoo finance offices and that was me doing walking the streets at night to get some exercise um uh Channel checking that&#39;s Canada Goose on Fifth Avenue and I&#39;m taking that picture I think from the van store I had a great conversation with the guy in the van store about how well the Avenue sneaker is doing because like one of these top skateboarders uses it so every skateboarder has to have it it&#39;s kind of like Tony Hawk back in my day and uh and the new school he can&#39;t even keep on the Shelf all the kids are coming in all the parents are coming in to buy for their kids for school so that was really good to see and then uh that&#39;s also Yahoo that&#39;s the high point okay and then today Kelly O&#39;Grady uh got to be on the claiming countdown Fox Business that&#39;s a picture I also had a picture on Twitter with Brad Smith the exact same picture at Yahoo so you can look that up on my Twitter feed I don&#39;t know where that got lost in the fold uh but first thing I want to bring on the Cavuto Coast to Coast segment from Monday it was actually two segments one in the beginning one at the end of the show and it really covers our whole perspective for the next few months so I want to listen in here record uh in the opening hour and a half or so it looks like we were going to uh be Off to the Races then all of a sudden after breaching that record we have since come down barely changed on the day what to make of that of course uh this is a time where a lot of Traders are trying to reassess what happens next month with the Federal Reserve most everyone agrees that a rate cut is coming what we don&#39;t know is how big a rate cut it will be kindly enough uh Thomas Hayes to answer some of those questions brilliant young man the chairman and the managing member great Hill Capital Thomas great to see you I&#39;m going to get a twofer with you today so I&#39;m excited let me ask you a little bit about how the market is digesting all of this news on the fed the of course the attention on Nvidia we got a lot going on this week yeah I think Friday at Jackson Hole that confirmed a regime change so with the FED cutting different groups in the stock market are going to be able to outperform for example uh small caps the first 12 months after the first cut they tend to outperform large caps by 11 full percentage points why because most small caps have leverage on their balance sheet and when they can refinance at lower rates they have a a higher propensity to survive but they outperform by that much how far does this go back this goes back to 1955 get out of town yeah it&#39;s wild and then on the but haven&#39;t they had a there was this transition going on yeah um so that it&#39;s going to go even beyond that yeah it started in July and then it cooled off with the Yen carry trade on wine for 24 hours but it&#39;s interesting the FED said they they&#39;re going to cut so now Bank of Japan what did they say now we can start to raise again so you&#39;re going to see groups like small cap start to out perform you&#39;re going to see International stocks uh start to outperform as as the Yen carry trade uh unwinds the dollar weakening rates coming down dividend payers start to outperform so what if the yen is becomes the world&#39;s Premier currency in this interim um how does that affect us wouldn&#39;t wouldn&#39;t that be good for us multinationals and their stocks in an environment like that yes us multinationals will do well uh it won&#39;t become the premier currency because their demographics don&#39;t support it but it could strengthen relative to the dollar in the near we saw a similar situation in the early 2000s if you remember emerging markets were were out small caps were out and then all of a sudden from 2002 to 2007 you had one of the biggest rallies in history in emerging markets in small caps actually in value over growth we had that concentration of tech going into that right so I don&#39;t think Tech is going to crash I just think they&#39;re going to underperform because their earnings growth is decelerating from 30% this year to 18% next year while the unmagnify they went from I like that the Magnificent Seven and the unmagic but they could be a little bit more magnificent now right that&#39;s right they&#39;re they&#39;re going from negative earnings growth they just inflected to positive earnings growth that is going to continue into 2025 so you can see with the waiting of tech the indices are a little bit more subdued but under the surface there&#39;s a tremendous amount of money to be made in individual high quality companies that are temporarily marked down now and I think reports Wednesday after closing bell and and normally it&#39;s been a good trade to buy up ahead of an earnings announcement because it does very well right afterwards I don&#39;t know how long that&#39;s held to be honest what do you expect this time I&#39;ll tell you it&#39;s priced for Perfection yeah I think that they&#39;ll probably have good earnings but the the analysts are saying they got to beat Revenue by $2 billion in order to move the needle they&#39;ve got to raise guidance by at least $2 billion people are a little worried about the Blackwell delay the new chip delay by mon want gu but if you I was I&#39;m old school I was always taught if you bu high quality assets when they&#39;re reasonable valuations good things tend to happen over time this is trading at 29 times sales $3.2 trillion valuation just to put that in perspective our entire GDP is 25 trillion Nvidia is 3.2 the upside potential in your eyes is limited it&#39;s a little more what about those who are existing Nvidia shareholders and have been riding this way would you tell them to cash out with part some of the shares look you you will have time okay so even if the if the report came in poorly I don&#39;t I don&#39;t know that it will because we did see from the hyperscalers a lot of demand for spend I think what we&#39;re what we&#39;re also seeing is margins are declining for the Magnificent 7 because of all that spend and at some point like you you remember Mark Zucker Brook with uh meta he said I&#39;m going to invest all this money in the metaverse and then all of a sudden the shareholders said we don&#39;t like that and they took the stock down below $100 all of a sudden he says you know what I&#39;m no longer going to invest that much in the metaverse and the stock went back up I think we&#39;re seeing a similar situation but he&#39;s actually one of the St performers of the meta yeah because he stopped all this all the spend on meta and I think investors are starting to ask where&#39;s the return on investment for all this AI spend on Nvidia chips and that&#39;s not a today story but as margins decelerate a couple quarters out and I think the Market&#39;s starting to see that uh we could see a situation where the spend for NVIDIA chips slows down and more competition comes up for for the GPU chips from other companies real quickly on the political race and how that&#39;s factoring in normally gets to be a big issue after Labor Day in October yeah um we were getting a lot of minations much earlier this year I don&#39;t know if that has anything to do with the race but what do you think okay election year seasonality going back to World War II we see strength on average through early to mid-september this year that happens to coincide with the first cut which historically it&#39;s sell the first cut so you have the election year seasonality which gets a little choppy in late September early October and sell the first cut so we think we&#39;ll Cruise along here for a few weeks maybe we&#39;ll get to New highs across the board and then get a little conservative before the election I think year and rally after the election hang on to that brilliant th because I do want to pursue this election thing with you because there&#39;s a raging debate going who takes credit when the markets go up who gets it when it goes down more Thomas Hayes in just a second we were mentioning this presidential race and where it sorts out we&#39;re getting indication right all right to here Donald Trump tell it markets go up it&#39;s because of him when they go down it&#39;s because of the other guy or gal bottom line is it&#39;s not quite that B white but but back with Thomas Hayes on on what factors the markets could be looking for and you were raising something interesting during the break it&#39;s not about who&#39;s at the top when it comes to the White House but the makeup of Washington explain empirically if you look back throughout history the stock market performs best when one party does not have have the executive the Senate and the house so what the markets really want to see is gridlock and what that is is a check on power in simple terms the less the politicians can do the better it is for the markets let the markets be free let business be free and and that will power things through and the stock market performs best in those environments now I was looking into a little bit of the history on this it&#39;s ideal if it&#39;s a democrat in the White House and the house Andor Senate are under Republican control or both and it has happened um that was a an ideal environment under Bill Clinton um how do you see it going now and what would be the ideal environment now well that is true empirically some of that was demographically based but if I was going to write a book on how to cause a Great Depression the first chapter would be entitled start taxing unrealized capital gains I mean you can&#39;t make this up who thinks of this that that you would run on that platform so uh the the number one thing that we want you&#39;re talking about kamla Harris&#39;s plan kamla Harris plan like you can&#39;t imagine you have one candidate that&#39;s Pro bus you have one candidate that&#39;s Pro just taking aside the politics out of it just from an economic standpoint the platforms of what&#39;s going to be better for employment what&#39;s going to be better for the economy I mean if you started taxing unrealized capital gains and people grasping for liquidity it would be the quickest way to a Great Depression normally you ta your capital gains once you the trade is commenced and all of that but if this would be obviously people would be less acclaiming at the markets now Democrats could come back and say well that&#39;s not our cup of te we don&#39;t like the markets uh but it&#39;s interesting you chose that issue rather than her wanting to raise the corporate tax rate to 28% well we&#39;ve been there uh there right we&#39;ve been there the corporate ta a lot higher we were at 35 I mean let&#39;s be fair some people like to borrow and spend politicians some people like to tax and spend politicians the key is all politicians like to spend that&#39;s how they retain their power so so that&#39;s that&#39;s a risk but uh in terms of uh the market in terms terms of uh corporate tax rates it still has to get through Congress so they&#39;ve got to have a grand slam Senate house and executive branch to push that through so the Market&#39;s kind of like okay 28% you&#39;re not going to get it uh even if you&#39;re elected as long as there are checks and balances the markets and the economy will be okay what do you think I&#39;ve talked to a lot of people from the markets Tom who say uh Donald Trump is far more Market friendly issues wise than he was as a president than Joe Biden or what we hear out of K Harris but their big pause is he&#39;s crazy and he&#39;ll do crazy things and that will defeat all the other good stuff he&#39;s doing and that gives them their trepidation is that justified okay this is hysterical so when Trump was elected everyone said energy stocks are going to do incredible China stocks are going to collapse and solar stocks are going to collapse the exact opposite happened energy stocks dramatically underperformed under Trump they did well under bid China had one of its biggest rallies uh uh during the Trump Administration and solar stocks did well what&#39;s happened under Biden energy stocks have done well Chinese stocks have collapsed they thought he would be weak on China he was tougher on China Trump just wanted to do a deal with China he saids we&#39;re going to T tariff you 60% and then he brings them to the table they cut a deal he wants to make money he wants to do business he wants to create jobs for Americans uh and and uh and so the obvious quid pro don&#39;t always pan out just like under Barack Obama that the drug makers and then the big pharmaceutical companies would tank they soared under him so sometimes goes against pattern how do you see it going uh if if if Donald Trump were to return well I think the Trump trade would be back I think what we saw after he was elected uh 2016 you saw small caps start to outperform you saw Industrials out outperform you start to the market started to price in A Better Tax environment uh which increases earnings look if you move the corporate tax rate up to 28% that&#39;s going to have an impact on earnings per share so then if you don&#39;t get multiple expansion you&#39;re going to have the market St falling on on the basis of lower earnings so I think that initially the market will like the idea also of no Wars under the Trump Administration there were there were no real geopolitical wars it was relatively peaceful geopolitical environment you don&#39;t have to worry right now we&#39;ve got kind of too far so they&#39;d lose sight of some of the crazier features uh in the case of kamla Harris they would dread some of that but again if she&#39;s held in check by a republican Congress house or Senate it&#39;s it&#39;s another game right yeah look at the end of the day earnings power is strong we we have projections of 15% earnings growth next year that&#39;s likely going to come around in the ballpark irrespective of who&#39;s elected is that right the the the key is going to be the policies moving forward and then the Outlook moving forward on the basis of those policies so if you could say if you have Pro bus policies then 2026 looks a lot better than prover policies 2026 maybe starts to look a little bit worse depending who&#39;s elected in which case the market will begin to price that after the election uh but on balance uh given the seasonality of election years as we touched on I think a little choppiness in October and we probably will get a year-end rally just because of the underlying strength and more likely than not whoever&#39;s elected we&#39;re going to wind up with gridlock and that&#39;s a good thing for the stock market well watch closely Tom great catching up with you Thomas Hayes following all of that uh one thing we left out with Tom is real estate and we&#39;re back and then I got to join Brad Smith uh who I just mentioned at Yahoo we had a great talk about Nvidia and all the other factors going into year end prior to Nvidia earnings and what we were saying might happen but first the fed&#39;s path forward here the central bank is expected to lower interest rates in September as inflation moderates and the job market sees signs of cooling so how should you be positioning your portfolio ahead of rate Cuts here to weigh in in studio we&#39;ve got Tom Hayes he is the great Hill Capital chair chairman and managing member here great to have you here with us in studio so first and foremost what type of pivot should investors be positioning for especially going into this first potential cut here come September as we&#39;re all expecting well I think Brad we&#39;ve got some seasonality factors at play in an election year since 1955 we generally have pretty good strength into early September into mid-september and then as we get closer to the election we get a little volatility late September October that happens to coincide with the first cut mid September and historically uh the first two three weeks after the first cut tends to be a little bit weaker so you you have the headwinds so I think you dance while the music&#39;s playing right now I think we&#39;re going to get uh probably some new highs we saw in the Dow yesterday uh we&#39;ll see what happens with Nvidia tomorrow maybe the S&amp;P and the NASDAQ will catch up a little bit and then I think as you look at all those profits and your smiling so wide you could eat a banana sideways in early September you say wait a second Cuts coming election volatility coming and maybe Harvest a few profits have a little cash on the sidelines late October deploy into urine rally you know it&#39;s really interesting because I I hesitate to ever cast any doubt on Nvidia especially in this day and age and in this market right now and in the performance that they&#39;ve exhibited but those Nvidia earnings are going to be out Wednesday that report itself if it is a dud then what does that signal for the back half of this year well initially because of the weight 6% 7% depending on the index initially you&#39;ll get some weakness but what we have seen since we got some clarity that the fed&#39;s going to be cutting is a regime change that started in July was temporarily impaired by the Yen carry trade on wine for a minute until boj relented and say wait we&#39;ll we&#39;ll wait to raise rates until the FED actually starts cutting so we don&#39;t get the liquidity mismatch um so I I think the focus is uh take the shift is going to be from large caps to small caps large caps underperform small caps in the first 12 months after a cut by 11% so small caps outperform by 11% and that&#39;s also consistent with earnings growth so this year small caps are expected to grow earnings at 7% next year 37% and and uh mag 7 earnings growth decelerates from 30% this year down to 18% next year so so if Nvidia it does less well than people think I think you&#39;re going to start to see a lot of the stocks under the surface start to pick up the slack so even if mag 7 underperforms uh you can make a tremendous amount of money under the surface just to just to put a fine point on this as well here I mean the information technology sector and according some to some data from fax set information techology is the reporting the second highest year-over-year earnings growth rate of all 11 sectors at 18.9% right now and Nvidia is the largest contributor to year-over-year growth right now so for investors trying to figure out whether or not even given the runup that we&#39;ve seen in Nvidia this is still a ripe investment opportunity what would you say to them okay it&#39;s nuanced I think the earnings are going to be okay tomorrow the reason is we saw all the hyperscalers were spending like crazy that&#39;s why their margins are going down the Magnificent margins are going down earnings growth is going down because they&#39;re giving all the money to Nvidia uh I think there&#39;s going to come a time where investors say where&#39;s the return on our investment that&#39;s two quarters out but right now Nvidia is price for Perfection uh 3.2 $2 trillion valuation our entire GDP is 28 trillion so you&#39;re saying it&#39;s worth 11% of our total GDP like trees don&#39;t grow to the sky it can grow a little higher but you have to keep in mind uh 28 times sales is pretty rich 37 times earnings is pretty rich yes you&#39;d say the earnings growth is 38% long-term growth but then you look at the numbers and it just doesn&#39;t make sense because Rule of 72 is it really going to double every two years that would imply it&#39;s going to be half a GDP before we know it uh doesn&#39;t make a lot of sense all right while we have you here just lastly because there are a lot of people who were trying to figure this one out and and you have some thoughts on it as well Boeing Boeing has a windy road of challenges that we&#39;ve seen over the course of this year the stock is down what 33% year-to date I think we have a chart we can toss up for the viewers at home do you see this as a buying opportunity I think it&#39;s phenomenal Kelly ortberg came from Rockwell Collins when he got involved with Rockwell Collins it was a$7 billion doll company six years later he sold it to for $30 billion four and a half bagger this guy knows how to run business the second thing is he&#39;s actually an engineer so for the F first time in a while we get to have Boeing run by an actual engineer versus a Salesman uh which is helpful when you want to keep doors on planes and keep thing you know fuselages together and all that stuff that&#39;s important uh but the key thing is it operates in a duopoly okay so at the end of the day you can say I don&#39;t like Boeing they&#39;ve been sloppy the last few years okay we&#39;ll get online at Airbus and you can wait 20 years for your next plane they&#39;ve got 6,000 plus backlog they just said oh by the way we underestimated the demand because China&#39;s uh China&#39;s flying is picking up the middle class is growing uh they&#39;re going to need another 8,000 planes so what you like to see with stocks that have Relentless everyday bad news is that they sto going down and that&#39;s happened to Boeing in the last few weeks uh headlines have been bad every single day and the stock stopped going down NASA saying that they&#39;re going to use SpaceX it couldn&#39;t get any worse like like you couldn&#39;t make this stuff up every single day they screw something up and the stock has stopped going down which tells you that most of the problems are in the rearview mirror Kelly ortberg is going to turn around this ship the duopoly is in place the backlog of over a decade is in place so we like this as a high quality business that&#39;s temporarily impaired yeah I should just clarify as well for those who are are viewing as well and you know the full story on the NASA the as well NASA&#39;s astronauts they used Boeing and Starliner to get them up there uh to the ISS and now we&#39;re trying to get them back and they&#39;re going to SpaceX for that anyway all these things considered still a Boeing story Tom you&#39;re still great great Hill Capital chairman and managing member Tom Hayes great to see you thanks so much apprciate it and then today I got to speak to Kelly ogrady uh my new nickname for her is Kelly o great g a t y I think she&#39;s doing a phenomenal job over at Fox Business and was happy to get on the show uh we covered Nvidia after the fact and the regime change we&#39;ve been consistently speaking about publicly that&#39;s starting to take shape in Earnest so we&#39;re going to listen in here brought up the the Blackwell chip piece cuz Tom I want to bring you in here on this right I know that that&#39;s something that you were watching closely to kind of get a sense of are are they going to elay fears right CEO Jensen Wong he said look we&#39;re still expecting revenue from this chip um in in 2024 was it enough for you I don&#39;t think so you know when I hear about watch parties for NVIDIA I I mean this thing was priced for Perfection it&#39;s like the inmates are running the Asylum this business is is valued at $3 trillion the entire US GDP is 20 trillion and here&#39;s what&#39;s better estimates of 40% long-term growth rate that implies the business is going to double every 2 years so in four years it would be worth $12 trillion or half of GDP I think it&#39;s a great business I think it&#39;s going to grow I think there&#39;s going to be demand I think price is what you pay value is what you get and 29 times sales is not interesting to me yeah no I mean look I hear you it&#39;s a great business suan pointed it out if if you have big tech companies saying spending spending spending it&#39;s clearly going to keep growing I&#39;m just bring out uh Scott you know jobless claims out today better than expected pce out tomorrow um the rate Cup&#39;s coming we&#39;re on Dow record watch a lot of Traders are fading this rally where do you stand on that I I agree with that and and not so much fading it because you know things are dire or things are bad but I think we&#39;ve certainly come so far so quickly since those lows three or so weeks ago and listen volatility is not going away obviously with the election just few months away with the FED in in 3 weeks and then we get the FED again early November volatility is there so when you have an opportunity to buy some protection in the marketplace with vixs now down back around 15 or so there&#39;s no reason not to do that so I don&#39;t know a lot of these guys back here and I talk to them all the all the time throughout the day that are shorting the market as much as they are hedging the market because there is an opportunity to hedge the market right now that&#39;s a Point sort of great context there Scott I Tom I I just want to bring you in here to end um R cuts are coming right a lot of our viewers are probably sitting in money markets thinking when do I get in when do I take advantage of this a lot of talk about the rotation trade so our small caps the place to be looking at as you sort of play this out over the rest of the year Well history since World War II tells us that is the play because uh for the 12 month following the First Rate cut small caps outperform large caps by 11% and that&#39;s consistent with what we&#39;re seeing with the deceleration of earnings growth of the Magnificent 7 and the reacceleration of the earnings power earnings growth of the unmagnify so the top seven they could kind of consolidate the gains that they&#39;ve had and there are going to be tremendous opportunities under the surface including small caps including dividend payers including emerging markets and I mean you know you you see that Trend coming in the Russell people are excited um we will see gentlemen we&#39;re going to have to leave it there Tom Scott appreciate your time today thank you okay look AI uh and we&#39;re back and just to give proper acknowledgement want to thank kellyo Grady Jake Mack and Katherine Myers for having me on the claim and countdown Fox Business want to thank Brad Smith Sarah Smith and Kristen suban for having me on Yahoo finance and want to thank Neil Cavuto Jenna Jenna D tomases Kevin Fitzgerald and Matt Hassen for having me on Cavuto on Monday I will be on Varney tomorrow morning Friday the 30th at 9:25 a.m. so please tune in if you&#39;re available and moving on to the quote of the week the intelligent investor is a realist who sells to Optimist and buys from pessimist and I think Nvidia is a good case study of this because we&#39;re going to see in a minute that fomo kicked in and Retail buyers were buying this thing hand over fist into earnings uh and you got kind of our view from uh kellyo Grady segment on what we think about that uh let&#39;s go into some data here and there&#39;s plenty of stuff to buy from pessimist too these days we&#39;re going to cover two of them in our oil cans and vans stock market and sentiment results article of the week uh by the way I&#39;ll also be on I don&#39;t know if you&#39;ll get this in time cgtn America tonight at 8m uh if you want to tune into that initial jobless claims Rising all this is pointing to the market is priced in about 100 basis points between now and the end of the year backend loaded and all this stuff matters uh the shift has Focus the focus has shift from inflation to jobs and um the jobs report will be more important than the pce tomorrow the jobs report next Friday will determine whether we start with 25 or 5050 I think we&#39;re going to start with 25 but we could go to 50 quick if the jobs are weak or stay at 25 and more likely do 25 25 25 before the end of the year uh this is all cover for the FED next households done with the leveraging debt to disposable income again is near uh all-time lows going all the way back 20 years uh Debt Service ratio is even goes back maybe 40 50 years so the deleveraging began when the great financial crisis in 2009 so the consumer is in better shape than uh advertised but you do have situations where the low-end consumer $75,000 and under is in pain uh their defaults are going up a bit and you saw it in Dollar General today getting smashed we&#39;re keeping an eye on that one for opportunities but it is kind of a similar situation to Advanced Auto Parts which is is also the lower-end consumer uh getting hit the difference between Dollar General and Advanced Auto Parts is there are 287 million vehicles that are average aged 12.7 years uh on the road and in order for people to drive their job their car needs to work so the spend at Advanced Auto Parts for the lower-end customer is less discretionary than buying Mike and IES at Dollar General and Advanced Auto Parts priced in the worst of the worst Dollar General is a massive growth stock that has just begun to crack in Earnest uh but we&#39;ll keep an eye for possible opportunities I think it&#39;s some time away number of times the word recession was mentioned in earnings calls that&#39;s collapsed just like you saw after the great financial crisis and just like you saw after Nvidia uh excuse me just like you saw after covid uh S&amp;P Global UK manufacturing PMI is is rocketing higher that&#39;s what we&#39;ve talked about as far as the UK recovery with gxo Etc uh UK manufacturing pmis employment same thing Services PMI turning back up UK firms see faster growth cooler inflation in Boon for Boe uh UK consumer confidence has rocketed up since T 2022 moving on private clients bought Reit financials and Tech ETFs in the last four weeks they sold Japan they sold Healthcare they sold Staples uh US dollar breaking below this channel this has been core to our thesis for everything we&#39;ve been talking about what outperforms which we actually mentioned with uh kellyo gradon Fox Business which was small caps emerging markets in our case China and uh dividend payers like the Stanley Black &amp; Deckers of the world and value as well Global junk uh Bond maturity wall records an historic decline so everyone was worried about refinancing and guess what they all got refinanced uh and rates are coming down they&#39;re going to refinance again and again uh 2024 already the third largest year for policy rate Cuts there have been 84 Cuts so far in 2024 which means what which means we are going to get a reti a reigniting of a global liquidity wave that help groups like biotech which have had a great run and we are enjoying and I think it&#39;s going to continue to run for a couple more years uh with this just beginning Bank of America let&#39;s see here 30-year fixed mortgage rates versus 10year yields what this is saying is that when the spread gets this wide mortgage rates collapse that will also be good for the generx of the world it will be good for the Stanley Black and Deckers of the world construction Etc um Industrials Etc so there&#39;s there&#39;s a lot to do here and you&#39;re going to see this absolutely roll over in coming months I think we could see a five handle back on the 30-year fixed rate mortgage which I think is going to have a different effect than most people think I think most people think that when mortgage rates drop housing prices are going to go up I I think the opposite is true I think when mortgage rates drop you&#39;re going to see a massive amount of Supply come onto the market for people that have been stuck and didn&#39;t want to trade out trade out and get stuck with a 7% mortgage when they&#39;re in a 3% mortgage uh it&#39;s not worth taking the double in California and moving to Texas or or the triple or you know the triple in New York and moving to uh you know sou South Carolina or something like that um but moving from a 3% mortgage to a 5% mortgage you&#39;re going to see a lot of baby boomers listing you&#39;re going to see an abundance of supply and I think that&#39;s going to help people who want to be buyers for those sellers waiting to be a seller you are going to be stuck in a crowd right now there is no Supply or limited Supply it&#39;s it&#39;s increasing but you still have a little bit of power if you list I look I&#39;m not a real estate agent but I&#39;m just telling you that maybe initially you&#39;ll get out if you&#39;re trying to sell by waiting for rates to go down but shortly thereafter whether it&#39;s weeks or months all of a sudden you&#39;re going to be competing with like a hundred properties in your town and you&#39;re going to wish you sold while rates were High um meaning we may start to see a realistic buying Market in the next 6 to 12 months Americans aren&#39;t being laid off yet so that&#39;s positive but obviously the FED is you know SE the writing on the wall and they want to get ahead of it which is nice oversold dollar is the furthest below the long-term Trend in 13 months this is just getting started so we&#39;re uh again we could have counter Trend moves like we talked about last week uh so we&#39;re certain then jumbo cut ahead in less than two months a 50 basis point cut has gone from impossible to certain implicit chance of at least one cut in 150 basis point cut in 2024 has gone up to over 100% that&#39;s kind of mind boggling when you think about it uh 5year tips yield is collapsed along with inflation dollar has collapsed same thing all the things that we were planning for equal weighted index breaking out to new highs while the na NASDAQ is showing weakness again things that we&#39;ve been talking about tomorrow&#39;s newspaper today China 2024 industrial production year onye uh 5.3% so this is recovering that&#39;s a good thing in China the industrial leads the rest here Dallas manufacturing is starting to turn up uh small caps ratio relative to QQQ this has gone up even more since this chart uh small cap starting to outperform the NASDAQ and why is that because earnings are going to outperform and in the first 12 months after the First Rate cut small caps are up on average 26.6% versus um large caps which are up 15% 11% spread we covered that on a couple of the shows that&#39;s a big deal uh this is from Bank Goldman Sachs saying that their estimate of Break Even rate of job creation has to be 50% otherwise you are that&#39;s uh assuming 1.5 million net immigration in 2025 if you get below 150,000 new jobs created in the reports you got a problem Latin America earnings Vision ratio is going up they troughed in 2022 latam is reaccelerating dramatically that&#39;s a good sign earnings growth here mag 7 versus unmagnify uh if you look UNM magnificent 493 started the year negative while mag 7 was up 50% by this quarter mag 7 was 29% uh unmagnify turned positive to plus 6% and by the end of of the year we&#39;re going to be plus 16% for the unag and down to plus 18% for the mag next year it uh it goes to 18% for the mag 7 um 15% for the S&amp;P overall including the mag 7 forward PE ratios you can see small cap and midcap are a huge bargain relative to large cap and historically you can see from 2010 to 2018 uh small cap and large cap got the premium I&#39;m sorry small cap and midcap got the multiple premium over large cap that has reversed it will mean revert stocks that split tend to be beat the index um unless Jensen Wong is selling a half a billion dollars of stocks into the hungry retail investors right after the split and then you get a different result and by the way if you can&#39;t get enough of Nvidia Jensen Wong will help you out he&#39;s got another 80 something billion dollars a stock that he&#39;s happy to to sell as He adjusted his plan to be able to sell more to everyone who wants it um St S&amp;P 500 this is the price rate of change from sentiment CH Trader you only see these dramatic extremes few times uh in in a period of years you got it at the bottom in 19 the bottom in 20 or 18 rather when uh Powell said autopilot and then you recently got it on the Yen carry trade and now we&#39;re back off Off to the Races which is a positive thing sector composition of the S&amp;P 500 by Equity capitalization it goes by sector you can see that Tech is now up uh 32% financials is 12% and what he&#39;s trying to communicate here is all the times that a sector has been in a bubble is when it&#39;s over 20% so energy in 1980 was 26% waiting then you had Tech in 2000 was 33% waiting then you had financials in 2006 and 2007 was 22% waiting so right now if you look at what&#39;s got heavy waiting infotex got 32% and nothing else even comes close so all the ones that are down in these low single digits expect them to gain more share expect Tech to moderate some whatat evolution of equity sector composition and Bubbles over time uh so this just looks at it in a different way which is the do was 25% then you had housing in that was in uh 2000 housing in 2029 China in 20072 2008 had a 25% waiting that was a bubble uh and now these are uh in at the exact opposite where Tech is at an extreme 33 and China is um China&#39;s very low and uh ready for mean reversion us durable goods orders month- on-month shot the lights out highest in four years uh that is including Transportation items wink wink core durable goods orders X Transportation were down 210 of 1% this table shows what happens to the S&amp;P one week two weeks 3 weeks one month 3 months 6 months one year after the first cut and as we&#39;ve been saying number one election year seasonality which we&#39;ve covered uh points to weaker second half of September and October followed by a yearend rally that&#39;s election year cyclicality and then if you look compound that with uh the uh first three weeks you know certain first two weeks show weakness on average up to the first three weeks after the first cut and then as you get three months out six months out one year out you tend to get uh more meaningful upsides so that&#39;s positive uh S&amp;P and first cut historically so little weakness and Then followed by strength that&#39;s from renmac durable goods orders you can just see here visually how dramatic that was uh orders for transportation equipment Skyrocket this is an interesting thing worldwide dating apps monthly active users have absolutely collapsed from 155 million pre in uh 2021 during covid now down to 135 million which is pretty anemic I guess everyone Found Love online during covid pending sales of starter homes up double digits starter home Inventory sores outpacing growth and tears we talked about this for many many months we said that the new theme was going to be not everyone needed to live in a 7,000 square foot starter home people could actually start in one in 2,000 square feet houses like levit Town post World War II when we had another demographic boom just like we&#39;re having now which is going to drive the economy and equities through the end of this decade and probably into the beginning of next decade the Roaring 20s I believe will be a slight understat mag 7&#39;s contribution to the S&amp;P 500 EPS growth started to shrink as the other 493 came out of its earnings season that&#39;s the name of the game that&#39;s The Core theme if you understand that you&#39;re going to have a very happy 24 months Futures implied fed terminal rate is down to 3% which implies what implies a mortgages with a for handle it also implies um nine cuts which would be a lot I&#39;m not sure if they&#39;re going to need all that but they may very well I could see a situation where they do four Cuts or three or four cuts and then you get a three and a half% inflation print and they stop cutting and they keep the terminal rate at four and they let inflation run between three and four for the next five years and you&#39;re going to wake up and whoever is President is going to say I&#39;m a genius debt to GDP is only 80% it used to be 120% Pat myself on the back trying not to break my hand and um and they&#39;ll take credit for it but a lot more of it has to do with demographics and being in the right place in the right time than them controlling their spending because politicians like to spend Prime book Global equities um monthly notional trading flows so they&#39;re short out the Wazoo just like they were in the hole in 2020 so be mindful of that consumer board com consumer confidence is turning up Rises on views of economy and inflation up to 103.3 from 101.9 dollar we showed that already dollar to yen broke this key trend line expect this trend to persist what happens after you break the trend a lot of times you go test the line again to fake people out and then over to sler at RBC let&#39;s take a look at the big picture here weekly technical chart book that that is from two days ago which is about the same as right now S&amp;P knocking on knocking on the door knocking on Heaven door here I think we go to new highs before midep and before rolling over I think you got to get everyone in the boat and then you open the trap door September and October when everyone thinks everything is perfect um NASDAQ similar thing maybe NASDAQ makes new highs too I would imagine so um you know that is going to be a harder question because you saw today the Dow and the Russell doing really well while NASDAQ and Tech weigh uh and Nvidia Weighing on the S&amp;P so we&#39;ll we&#39;ll see jurries out on that uh equal weight breaking out to new highs already knocked and heaven&#39;s door was open at the prle gates S&amp;P midcap same story S&amp;T small caps coming off the mat with that fake out with the carry trade uh quote unquote unwind I think this is going to be the story for the next three weeks breaking back above here I don&#39;t know if we get I doubt we get to 2500 in the next few weeks but maybe we do and then during October November we come back and test this or come back and test this before a long-term upside um on to the next small cap index we covered that that&#39;s uh Toronto uh that here&#39;s Tokyo I don&#39;t see this one going to new highs this one I think it&#39;s going to fail uh if you have been listening and the Hang saying I love this guess what broke out the trend line retested now breaking back up and I think the game is just beginning uh we&#39;ll cover Alibaba got the Dual listing approved in the general meeting on the 22nd which means uh that it it can be included in the southbound stock connect on September 9th which will enable 180 million new buyers to buy Alibaba for the first time from mainland China what we&#39;re seeing in terms of flows is people are raising some cash from Pino Duo and 10 cent uh so my guess is some of this money is allocated to be able to purchase Alibaba for the first time and we&#39;ll be excited to welcome those fellow co-owners for the longterm very soon and that could be if you listened to last week with Brendan somewhere between 20 to4 billion dollar of buying power over time so we&#39;re very very excited about that and you can see that this trend line downtrend broke and now we did the retest and now we&#39;re going back to the promised land uh bullish sentiment we&#39;ve covered that a million times uh 10year yield rolling over everything we need to say probably see a counter Trend move here I would imagine 10-year yield uh same thing dollar same thing all the things are in place Japanese Yen probably get a counter Trend move but uh that is going to strengthen over time Canadian dollar the Looney is getting strong ladies and gentlemen that is good news not bad news dollar getting weak for all of our Canadian viewers they are smiling so wide they could eat a banana sideways uh gold I think this is going to prove to be a fake out over time uh copper Futures this is turning back up with China turning back up that&#39;s gonna that that move is probably just getting started um and I think that&#39;s all we need to cover from this by the way SMH I don&#39;t know if I have that article yeah I do I do um it was funny Nvidia every time Nvidia goes down Intel goes up and we&#39;re going to talk about why and that&#39;s pretty exciting as well um I could see a scenario where the SMH goes down and Intel goes up a lot but uh we&#39;ll talk about that in future episodes because I want to get you out of here and get you to wherever you&#39;re going in my case it&#39;s called the golf course in many of your cases I&#39;m sure it&#39;s called the beach and uh I think that&#39;s all we need to cover CCI look at this beautiful breakout back test moving higher it&#39;s going to keep moving higher this thing is just getting started we&#39;re so excited about this one uh you guys hung in there while we build that base and now we&#39;re back off to the promis land and let&#39;s see what else did he cover here he covered a lot of stocks this guy&#39;s busier than a one-arm paper hanger all right moving along let&#39;s see what else we got here Nvidia market cap of course it can grow at 40% it&#39;ll be 100% of GDP in eight years that makes a lot of sense but the sell side thinks that makes sense and that&#39;s why they&#39;re the they&#39;re holding the bag today um all right retail investor purchases of Nvidia before earnings of course after it hits2 and a53 trillion dollar everyone wants it when it&#39;s at500 billion and a trillion no one wants it it&#39;s just the way it goes and they couldn&#39;t get enough Nvidia so they had to buy a triple levered Nvidia levered right into earnings and get smoke absolute smoke show as Jensen Wong is selling more of his stock to you uh oh and by the way in order to absorb all the stock that he&#39;s selling to you he was so kind to authorize another $50 billion of buyback in order to create a market for him to sell stock on the market at 29 times sales that makes a lot of sense where was the $50 billion when it was at you know a hundred billion valuation nowhere to be found where&#39;s the $50 billion now it&#39;s AT3 trillion valuation all right uh cumulative S&amp;P 500 performance for September starting in 1954 so this is exactly in line with what we&#39;ve been saying further strength possible new highs into mid-mon right before the buy the rumor sell the news of the cut and then some weakness into month end uh same thing with the dollar this counter Trend move that that we may get here and then weakness into September October uh expected F fed funds expected rate change uh 200 basis points now uh at the beginning uh last September it was only 33 basis points it&#39;s amazing opinion follows Trend ladies and gentlemen initial joob claims this is what the fed&#39;s worried about this is why the fed&#39;s taking action we talked about the performance after the first cut I was supposed to talk about PayPal and Disney today on Clayman but we ran out of time um and by the way I was on with Scott Bower who&#39;s a really good guy and I like him a lot I didn&#39;t know that he was going to be bullish Nvidia and I was going to be bearish so Scott if you&#39;re listening no offense it&#39;s just my view on the stock I may be wrong and you may be right but uh always love going on with you and uh didn&#39;t expect to be uh taking the other side of you on that on that one but uh all right Disney M puts Morgan Stanley James Gorman in charge of finding Bob iger&#39;s successor this I believe is the next Catalyst for Disney stock besides all the things that we&#39;ve talked about in terms of the pricing in terms of value Act and the other thing that&#39;s very interesting besides the fact that value act an activist investor in Disney besides the fact that they uh turned around Salesforce turned around New York Times and turned around Spotify through changing their pricing uh uh packages and everything else and completely multiplied the stock when they were involved in an activist and they&#39;re doing that with Disney one of their biggest successes was actually playing a role in getting the new CEO for Microsoft his name was SAA nadela and SAA was a catalyst for a huge multibagger over many years I believe the next Catalyst for Disney and I also believe uh value Act is going to play a significant role in addition to James Gorman and may have actually chosen G James Gorman for the job of picking the CEO the next Catalyst will be the announcement of who will succeed Bob Iger and I can assure you with Val value act involved and James Gorman involved it&#39;s going to be a big name a name like uh uh this the Chipotle guy going over to Starbuck that type of impact I don&#39;t know who it&#39;s going to be but it&#39;s going to be a major major player that everyone loves a high-end operator that can absolutely rock it and I think that&#39;s the next Catalyst for Disney because they&#39;ve already put all the mechanisms in place in terms of the highest return on uh invested Capital uh allocations to the parks and to the cruises and then raising the prices for Disney plus and blockbuster movies they&#39;re they&#39;re hitting on all cylinders I have a couple weak quarters because the the lowend customer is a little bit uh weak but that will come back and uh and they&#39;ll have a new CEO that everyone&#39;s going to be excited about and I can&#39;t wait to see who it&#39;s going to be Intel hiring Morgan Stanley and other advisers for activist events I gotta say it would not Shock me to wake up one morning and see Elliott has taken a 10 not a 10 a couple billion dollar position two to five billion dollars in Intel trading at tangible Book value and shake the tree like nobody&#39;s business and if that happens this is going to be a $40 stock much faster than we expect and uh then have the runway to of ultimately be an80 and $100 stock if they get The Foundry uh deal correct and speaking of getting The Foundry deal correct uh today there was an announcement and this is what we&#39;ve all been waiting for it well first off the we saw from Best Buys shoot the lights out earnings is that they can&#39;t believe the demand for aip&#39;s and who is the leader in aip&#39;s that is going to ship 40 million this year is Intel and what else happened with Intel today IBM Cloud to offer Intel&#39;s gouty 3 AI chips next year what does that mean it&#39;s half the price from of the Nvidia h100 it&#39;s twice as fast and it&#39;s 40% more energy efficient so if you think that investors are going to stand by and allow the hyperscalers to spend unlimited amounts of money on Nvidia chips uh with no clear return on investment and if you go back to the the seoa article the $600 billion question given the amount that mag 7 have spent on Nvidia chips it would require $600 billion of new Revenue that&#39;s not there to justify to spend so they&#39;re going to want to keep investing in AI but they&#39;re going to want to do so in a way where they can get closer to a return on investment sooner otherwise shareholders are going to force them to stop just as I mentioned on Cavuto if you remember when Mark Zuckerberg was spending uh I think 1010 billion on the metaverse and all of a sudden shareholders said there&#39;s no return on this and they sold the stock down from like 300 down to $80 uh all of a sudden he said oh did I say I was going to spend a lot on a metaverse I must I was mistaken now the Stock&#39;s at $80 uh I decided not to do that anymore because there&#39;s no clear return on investment uh and all of a sudden the stock rebounded from 80 up to 4 500 wherever it is right now I think you&#39;re going to see the same thing with hyperscalers Google uh Amazon Etc that will either have to justify the return on investment or find new ways of doing more with less and Intel is the way to do that to get more for less money and IBM is ahead of the curve on this with the gouty gouty 3 twice as fast half the money uh etc etc etc so what is that going to do it&#39;s going to impair nvidia&#39;s margins and I think this is very much like the gp1 Eli L came out this week and said oh by the way we&#39;re not going to charge you $1,000 for Zep bound we&#39;re going to charge you $399 for zound why because this little company called hims and hers was selling one at $200 a month that you know they paid a PR machine to go out and say that&#39;s dangerous it doesn&#39;t work except everyone was buying it and probably there were people getting results and all of a sudden they said well just out of the kindness of our heart we&#39;re going to drop our prices by 60% because we&#39;re such a great beautiful company and uh and all of a sudden we realize what we knew from the beginning that glps are a commodity and you can get them anywhere and it&#39;s a race for the bottom with price uh and they can be life-changing that the JW is still out on that but so far so good it looks great we&#39;ll see uh over the long term uh but what we do know is it&#39;s no longer the Holy Grail because it can be replicated and the same is going to be through the case with Intel and the uh GPU chips that everyone thinks only Nvidia can make except for the fact that others are going to catch them or make something at least close enough good at such a lower price that buyers pressured by their shareholders are either going to have to stop their spend which makes them less potentially less competitive or modify their spend so they can keep pedal in the metal for AI and AI training and data centers and all of that but do it at a more reasonable cost Which Intel has always been a commodity producer and uh will have the Machinery that none of them have with foundaries and be able to produce it&#39;s going to be awesome so um uh I&#39;ll let you know how I really feel about it in just a minute I&#39;m kidding all right uh what else do we have here the big number 88,000 revisions tomorrow&#39;s newspaper today we&#39;ve been talking about that for a year we say they&#39;ve already misreported 500,000 more jobs it turned out to be 88,000 more jobs uh hedge funds are consciously uncoupling from the mag s so they&#39;re seeing the writing on the wall you saw duck and Miller selling out many others feds Powell declares the time has come for rate Cuts uh we all know that&#39;s coming why Disney plus has succeeded while Netflix Rivals struggle and we know the answer to that is because they&#39;ve got the best content Li library in the world and I was also slated to speak about Disney didn&#39;t get time but the key thing there is that the parks and the experiences and the cruises and the consumer products are valued at about $80 a share the stocks trading at 90 which implies the 153 million subscribers that by the way their prices went up dramatically uh are worth zero and the billion dollar Blockbusters called Deadpool and Wolverine and Inside Out 2 are worth nothing and ESPN is worth nothing and we&#39;re taking a a wildly crazy position that they&#39;re actually worth something and uh you could say well they have half the subscribers of Netflix okay well Netflix is worth $300 billion so could we be worth 50 billion could be we be worth a 100 billion oh and by the way have a double in the stock in the meantime the answer is yes and um there you go fomo returns to the options Market says Traders Chase stocks higher maybe we&#39;ll get some gamma squeeze into the first half of September and we&#39;ll continue to harvest profits like we did earlier in the summer for our two mag s Holdings which we sold off um meaningfully um and our banks which we also had big runs we sold off and uh we&#39;ll get a chance to reload some of those potentially in late October before the election when everyone&#39;s panicked as if it&#39;s going to matter at the end of the day gridlock is the name of the game and for the markets for the markets for other things there there are things that are very important to people and I get it and um I&#39;m you know that&#39;s not what we do at hedge fund tips with Tom Hayes we talk about business the starter home is making a comeback as the housing market thoughts for firsttime buyers we talked about that Teemu parent PDD stocks suffering a record plunge after record after Revenue misses forecast we&#39;ve been saying for months either unsustainable or unreliable so far it&#39;s only turned out to be the former unsustainable you can&#39;t keep selling crap at a loss uh and and expect it to work and uh and we may find also based on the Ft article down the road that it was also the numbers were also unreliable uh we have no position long or short uh we just know that the competition they&#39;re referring to is Alibaba got off their ass and said no Moss we&#39;re bigger we&#39;re better we&#39;re smarter we&#39;re coming at you and they did and they stopped the bleeding they are regaining share and uh teu is going to be uh a competitor but they&#39;re not in the same league and as the Chinese economy recovers and people actually buy normal stuff versus cheap stuff that goes in the garbage bin after a week uh Alibaba is going to reign supreme tool up for lower rates with Stanley Black and&amp; Decker this is a huge article from The Wall Street Journal this thing I mean we&#39;ve had a big move in it but it&#39;s just getting started and um and we&#39;re excited to see all these thesis continually play out one by one fed cut could lift Chinese stocks here who could benefit we know who could benefit this I&#39;ll continue to remind my wealthy investor friends who are listening there are opportunities in beating down Office Buildings and in this off and in this article uh and Barons they&#39;re talking about certain REITs and so on but you you all know what I&#39;m talking about and you&#39;re probably ahead of the pack on that the key is just holding period and burn until it turns and what&#39;s going to cause it to turn is a higher R employment rate where people get scared and they want FaceTime they go back to the office but more important than that every boss knows they get twice the productivity from people when they come to the office and the collaboration and the magic that comes from 1 plus one is three but they don&#39;t have any leverage to force people back to the office when the labor market is not is still tight that is changing once it does they&#39;ll just say you don&#39;t want to come to the office you know mail in your your security pass and let&#39;s call it a day and that&#39;s going to be happening more and more and more and that&#39;s where Office Buildings are going to fly met uh a person uh when I was out to dinner the other night and um she was saying she&#39;s doing leases at like 140 a foot in New York for a properties B andc are still spotty but like it&#39;s it&#39;s hotter than ever so uh there you go and Boeing says a travel boom in China will double demand for planes Yeah so basically Boeing was saying yeah you know how we said we had 10 years of backlog with 6600 plan planes yeah we messed that up too it&#39;s actually another 8,000 planes that we don&#39;t think we&#39;re going to be able to provide because we don&#39;t have enough capacity we in other words we have more people throwing money at us than we&#39;ll ever be able to possibly handle and you can&#39;t give the stock away and those are the things we like the common sense things the cigar butts that are sitting down there and before long it&#39;s a double in everyone says oh how can I get call opt daily and weekly call options at on Boeing when it&#39;s at $400 and it&#39;ll be sold to them the dumb money poured into Nvidia ahead of its results it could have been worse so that&#39;s from Steve Goldstein over at market watch Canada Goose known for heavyweight parkas leans into t-shirts and shorts um we&#39;ll see we&#39;ll see we&#39;re going to cover this one maybe in detail next week um obviously their APAC is shooting the lights out I think that&#39;s going to continue to even grow further uh China vows to Quick Quicken buying unsold homes for public housing so again they&#39;re they continue to make these incremental moves so that&#39;s good Nvidia tumbles after disappointing forecast Blackwell chip snags the gouty 3 is working just fine here was an analyst saying that uh Neen said Rivals such as Intel could quote unquote chip away at nvidia&#39;s market share if they developed a better product which they have with gouty 3 certainly over the h100 not quite at Blackwell levels yet but you know Blackwell&#39;s delayed that&#39;s going to give in uh Intel some time but twice the speed half the price 40% more energy efficient energy is a huge input cost for the whole uh training game for AI so that&#39;s that but IBM going with Intel here is a big deal ladies and gentlemen because if you remember IBM is the OG of Intel you remember wat of um AI if you remember Watson and Jeopardy and all that stuff so uh so they know know a thing or two about training models Alibaba 10-cent cast wide net for AI upstarts since 2023 40% of alibaba&#39;s deals in China and 30% 10 cents of targeted AI startups I think we&#39;re going to find out some where 12 24 36 months down the road that a lot of our gains were attributable to something that we didn&#39;t even know that we didn&#39;t even know something they owned wound up being a thousand bagger and we had 10% of the company through our ownership in Alibaba because they give them cloud computing credits in exchange for equity which is a brilliant deal uh Alibaba shareholders approved dual primary listing Paving the way for September southbound inclusion we talked about that that&#39;s a big deal pind Duo suffers a 55 billion market cap wipe out after flagging uncertain market and The Comedy of this is that Intel you know pindu do I think sold off 30 something percent and intel was uh not Intel Baba was down like 4% on that day thinking oh the Chinese consumer is weak that&#39;s not the reason timu was down the reason timu was down is because Alibaba said no MOS and took the share back started taking share back and they can&#39;t compete with them because they&#39;re bigger they&#39;re stronger they&#39;re meaner and now that they&#39;re focused they&#39;re going to destroy them so um other than that how was the play Mrs Lincoln so let&#39;s get down to our article of the week oil cans and vans stock market and sentiment results let&#39;s see where we are on time we got to get you guys to the beach uh we covered all that all right I will go through the key points for the Advanced Auto Parts update so key points for the continued turnaround number one solvency risk is off the table they they sold the one point .5 billion World pack business they&#39;ll get 1.2 billion net and they will use that to bring down the debt ratio to 2.5 times and reignite growth by opening a 100 stores per year they&#39;ve got a new real estate team so this is not just a stay alive story this is a growth story a stay alive story makes it a double over the next three to five years which they just guaranteed with that sale and paying down the debt a growth story of opening another hundred stores a year and shutting the ones that are cash flow negative which is a creative to free cash flow is the story that story that we want to hear which is what this guy is doing who ran Shane Kelly Shane o Kelly who ran HD Supply S7 billion do business for Home Depot he knows how to run this type of business and he&#39;s taken the steps to move it and it&#39;s going to happen over time yes the 75,000 and under is weak yes it&#39;s weak but they were still able to increased com store sales by 4% EUR over-year despite the Challenge lowend Customer also they had a ton of stuff uh that was just mispriced relative to the competition now they&#39;re not racing to the bottom but what they are doing is matching their competitors at the prices that there where they are so they&#39;ve got an equal shot to get the business and he tells a story about a radiator that was like $50 more than any of his competitors and he was wondering why they weren&#39;t selling radiators well du you got to be in line with the market and they&#39;ve done that now across the board so they&#39;re getting products to people quick and the most important thing that they&#39;re doing that their competitors have been less good at doing is paying up for their Frontline people in order to have people that can talk to the professionals remember it&#39;s a blended box half of it&#39;s from the do-it-yourselfers walking in to buy a battery and putting it in the parking lot and the other half is the professionals down the street with their garage need a part right away because they got to get the the car off the lift or they lose money by tying up the bay so Advance needs to get know what the parts are get on the parts quickly add a reasonable competitive price and that&#39;s what they&#39;re now doing and they&#39;re the only ones that have these specialized Frontline people who actually have experience in the business versus hiring someone who worked at Carl Jr the week before who knows about lettuce rfts but doesn&#39;t know anything about you know alternators and uh sounds like an idiot when the professionals call so I think over time they&#39;re going to build that Goodwill with the professionals and be the go-to place in selected regions that they dominate uh the other thing that they&#39;re trying to do is they&#39;re going to shut down areas uh that they&#39;re not the leader and they&#39;re going to reinvest around areas where they are uh so they can keep keep the growth and keep every store uh growing free cash flow which is the name of the game this guy knows his stuff the Distribution Center consolidation down to 14 from 38 and they&#39;ll have these nodes and hubs all over the country that&#39;s going to lead to at least 50 million of procurement savings next year and then finally he talk to uh a achieving 100 million of free cash flow this year this is what we talk about every single uh company all we need to know is that solvency risk is off the table and they&#39;ve got some level of they&#39;re getting to cash flow positive or even generating free cash flow and then if it&#39;s priced in for death and it doesn&#39;t die that&#39;s when you get doubles and triples and that&#39;s that&#39;s going to be the case here just as it was with Cooper standard and then once they get going they take on a life of their own and that&#39;s when you get multi-baggers and um by the way while we&#39;re on to it uh go to hedgefund tips.com click on terms this is all opinion not advice speak to your financial advisor etc etc etc we deal exclusively with accredited investors qualified clients family offices Etc and uh so you can go through these 30 pages of stuff that I outlined oneon-one um this is how you become a good investor so most of you are going to blow through this and just take those eight points and run with it and that&#39;s perfectly fine but those of you who are serious about honing your craft when you read thousands of these over a career and you pay attention to every single word you start to large language model develop inputs where 3 years down the road you&#39;re going to see a different company and and a certain series of actions and you&#39;re going to say I&#39;m going to make a fortune on this because this is what I saw happen in the past and this is what happens when this aals bals C equals D but you can only do that from doing the work consistently over a long period of time there&#39;s no quick fix uh and if you get a a quick double or triple and you haven&#39;t done any of the work you&#39;ll give it back to the casino because you don&#39;t know how you got there um all right so you can see we did a ton of work on this but let&#39;s go on to VF Corp so we did oil cans now let&#39;s do vans the key key points for a continued turnaround free cash flow plus proceeds from non-core physical asset sales is $600 million for this year that&#39;s excluding the $1.5 billion Supreme sale they brought their debt down 587 million so far this year uh Northface had a direct to Consumer UPS 6% their us wholesale was the weak point uh they got 1.5 billion so again these are key things we&#39;ve been saying we going to come are now happening with Advanced Auto Parts getting rid of wh pack deleveraging the balance sheet getting back to growth hundred stores a year VF Corp taking solvency risk off the table selling the Supreme getting a decent price paying down debt putting some into the business for growth on track for $300 million The Cost Cuts on top of it Vans quote while the headline numbers remain weak several indicators are showing we&#39;re headed in the right direction EMA is once again the region which is showing clear early encouraging signs with wholesale up in the quarter for the first time in six quarters with particularly positive momentum in key accounts and he said last quarter that EU was kind of the canary in the coal mine when that starts to turn it&#39;s the beginning of the entire world turning and he reemphasized that on this quarter&#39;s call Vans quote our new products which are performing well across regions the new school continued to gain momentum and is performing well across regions and is now the number two franchise globally it&#39;s exactly what the guy in the store the skater dude who puts the skateboards together was telling me I spent an hour and a half talking to him about every single shoe and traffic and where people are coming from and what are the age of people and what are they excited about and why do they buy and all the other things that you would do in a channel check next new products and marketing efforts are resonating with consumers and contributing to further progress in Google search Trends which continue to move in the right direction across our markets nine Northface quote ac across both channels and regionally the standout continues to be APAC which grew strongly up 35% even as we com comped the postco opening quarter last year that&#39;s China ladies and gentlemen where the consumer is quote unquote dead but has more cash than ever they will thaw they will get excited again when all their friends start to have new clothes they will too quote at Vans we still see modest sequential Improvement as we did this quarter moving forward so each quarter look it&#39;s not exciting to be down so much and say wow we&#39;re doing great we&#39;re down less this quarter than we were last quarter it&#39;s like take them around back and shoot them already but it&#39;s it&#39;s a turnaround process we knew exactly what the plan was and as you know despondent as some of the numbers look when they&#39;re saying them that was all part of the plan so don&#39;t shoot him just yet he&#39;s doing a great job the uh the new platform in the Americas approved from adopted from Europe This was another key part of the plan is moving strongly in the right direction and at Vans we&#39;re seeing prog the progress we&#39;re expected next Vans the new franchises are doing well and we&#39;ve got two of our new franchises that are now in the top five so Ultra range and new school One&#39;s number two and one&#39;s number five Vans quote our Grassroots campaign is well underway as is our influencer campaign you may have seen a few celebrities caught wearing Vans just recently if you Google it you&#39;ll see it we covered it last week I think it was Jennifer Lawrence and two other young it girls that I have no idea who they are I&#39;ll ask my daughters vfc quote some Emily Rakowski was one I know who she is and then um I forget the other one uh quote something that some of you may not have realized we are moving super fast here and a lot of what we&#39;re doing for example right now I can&#39;t tell you what we&#39;re doing but we&#39;re doing a lot right now that we&#39;re not disclosing for example at this point last quarter we didn&#39;t tell you about Sun that&#39;s the lady that&#39;s going to run vans that came from from Lulu you didn&#39;t know about Carolyn who&#39;s running North Face uh you didn&#39;t know about Supreme which they got one and a half billion dollars and I&#39;m I&#39;m not suggesting we&#39;ve got people changes or portfolio changing my point is we just got big activities that are happening all the time now and the pace is not going to let up this guy this is his last run this is his Jerry Seinfeld go at the top go out at the top Brack and Daryl is winner and he&#39;s going to turn this thing and it&#39;s going to be a multibagger and everyone&#39;s going to look back at actually you know it&#39;s funny no one&#39;s going to look back and say wow that was such a great call you only hear when it&#39;s not working you never hear when people cash in for a five bagger and they&#39;re like wow that was unbelievable you never get that call it&#39;s always like when is this one gonna work you know it&#39;s like unbelievable uh the gift that never gives all right uh Van&#39;s plan quote so what are we doing we so we&#39;re innovating and also putting in franchise management so innovating by bringing out new Styles uh so you&#39;ve seen you&#39;re starting to see them come out one at a time now AV 2.0 that&#39;s what the skater guy was talking to me about on Fifth Avenue the new school three new Styles this quarter and we&#39;ll have more coming and then some really key collaborations to give energy and then franchise management when you&#39;re going to see us take the gas out of some of the older styles for a while and then Rego them when we first at the very top of the culture chain with key influencers and then flow them down so what are they doing everyone and their mother bought Vans three years ago they got every color of checkerboard uh slip-ons in their in their uh closet because it was hot it was trendy and that&#39;s what Vans does since the 1950s is it runs in cycles and so they&#39;re not going to jam something that people have in their closet what are they doing they&#39;re coming out with brand new stuff to get people excited about the Vans brand like they&#39;re doing with new school like they&#39;re doing with AV 2.0 like they&#39;re doing with the ultra long or whatever that&#39;s called um uh maybe I got the wrong ones the C the uh lowlands which I think are cool as hell and um so they keep putting these out and then once they hit Peak excitement and everyone wants Vans then they&#39;re going to flow through the classic stuff that goes bananas and you&#39;re going to see revenues just hockey stick like nobody&#39;s business but they&#39;re creating the buzz they&#39;re laying the foundation and then they&#39;re going to jam the channels but they&#39;re not going to do that right now so they&#39;re going to degas it and then Rego it and look I&#39;ve never run a footwear company but I&#39;ll tell you what I like hearing that he has a plan and he knows exactly how this is going to go just like he said what was going to happen with Europe just like he said what was going to happen by bringing the platform over just like he said he was going to sell a key part of the portfolio to delever the balance sheet and invest in growth just like he said dot dot dot dot dot both Shane o Kelly and Brack and Daryl bet on the jockey they&#39;re doing exactly what they said it&#39;s just it&#39;s the day Traders and the emotional morons that it doesn&#39;t go fast enough lose out the opportunity so we&#39;ll sell a piece of our stock to them at $50 and we&#39;ll sell some more to them at $80 and will give them as much as they want at $100 and sold to you and it&#39;ll go up to1 110 and they&#39;ll hold it to 50 because they&#39;re so excited about the story at 110 just like everyone&#39;s so excited about $3 trillion Nvidia that&#39;s going to grow at 40% a year just do some math ladies and gentlemen rule is 72 72 divided by 40 which means the company&#39;s going to double every 1.75 years so in three and a half years the company will go from three trillion to 6 trillion to 12 trillion 50% of GDP in 3 and a half years based on current cell side estimates for long-term growth you can&#39;t make this stuff up and when I said to Kelly it&#39;s like the inmates are running the Asylum welcome to Crazy Town I mean you you literally can&#39;t make this stuff up like how people sync that math is beyond me so leaving that aside unless we can start eating gpus and building houses with gpus I think the probability is low so uh gross margin uh quote we do expect gross margin to improve throughout the year so that&#39;s all good there a million things here you can go through we are going to get you to the beach we&#39;re already an hour and change in and we got to get to uh fear and greed is still neutral that&#39;s a good thing if we expect a couple more weeks of strength earnings came in a little bit uh but this doesn&#39;t account for weightings of stocks but just an aggregate Dow down 1.92 for this year 1.21 for next year it&#39;s probably skewed into one stock you can look at it on the website NASDAQ came down a bunch more uh this has to be one company 7.6 76 which is why we&#39;ve been saying mag 7 decelerating UNM mag 493 accelerating where do you want to put your money UNM mag 493 divid and pay small caps Emerging Markets IE China uh be interested to see which company is respons I for a lot of this H he did the numbers wrong here all right well all right we&#39;ll get this redone we&#39;ll get it posted this is getting deleted all right moving on uh economic data durable goods orders this shot the lights out that&#39;s a good sign retail sales had been good that&#39;s not this week I&#39;m talking about last week so it&#39;s confirmatory that there&#39;s still some strength there Atlanta GDP now at 2% uh initial jobless claims today were in line with expectations but still with the two handles so that&#39;s uh you know that&#39;s what&#39;s got the FED in action here 231 versus 233 last print pce prices came down tomorrow we&#39;re going to see pce which people think is important I think it&#39;s less important than the jobs report at this point let&#39;s move on to the ask me anything questions so for those of you who don&#39;t like ask me anything questions thank you for tuning in we&#39;ll be back next week for those of you who do like ask me anything questions here we go and thanks for submitting them okay number one John Manza why is GX appearing to dilute shareholders a shelf offering number one you do a shelf offering proactively so if they have you know if I&#39;m a CEO and I expect really good things to happen in a in a reasonable amount of time I want a shelf offering in place because if I get to some ridiculous valuation before the fundamentals support it I want to be able to say sold to you in the Shelf offering that I viewed there was no Clarity around size or Price or anything I think they just did it as a kind of like you buy in Insurance in the future or they could be doing a shelf offering if they have to uh if they want to buy a company and use stock to do it as well so it&#39;s unclear whether at all any delution is going to be the case I&#39;m not worried about those guys because they have decades worth of history in creating shareholder wealth not destroying it not doing dumb deals not diluting shareholders and this time will be no different moving on uh etay Naman loyal listener yes etay I know you&#39;ve been with us for a long time excited to see a Fed cut soon POS gdq stock conect weakening dollar com together all at once uh would love to Ticker on Z oom d all right let&#39;s see what this is I I wonder if he&#39;s referring to regular Zoom no Zoom d h this is a tiny trading vehicle we would never put clients in something like this but I&#39;ll take a quick look at it z o m d oh it&#39;s a Canadian company all right cash flow revenues are rolling over free cashow has gone up a little bit growth margins are up this is a strange company what are these guys doing marketing technology user acquisition engagement platforms worldwide that&#39;s more ambiguous than any anything I&#39;ve ever heard in my life operates a mobile app user acquisition platform that integrates with various digital media Outlets unified view of mar resources comprehensive the only word they don&#39;t have in here is AI I mean this sounds like a big promote so if you want to play the I&#39;ll be smarter than the suckers game have at it for me I don&#39;t know I see declining revenues I see I&#39;m sure they have a decent balance sheet 4 million of cash zero debt cash flow from operations is spotty but I think that&#39;re free cash flow positive yes uh I have to see the composition of that this is a $3 million company I mean I can&#39;t really say anything about this um yeah it&#39;s not for me it doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s not going to work I mean I&#39;d have to do 10 hours of work on this for me to even look at it and I don&#39;t I&#39;m not able to do that so um so for me it&#39;s a pass uh doesn&#39;t mean it won&#39;t work Philip Andrew Andrew pinkos hey Tom thank you for the invaluable insights you provide you&#39;ve unknowingly become a significant mentor to me what are your thoughts on Dollar General and Dollar Tree I&#39;m curious about your entry point for Dollar General I appre okay I&#39;ll I&#39;ll tell you my exact entry point before I do it now uh uh we&#39;re not close to doing anything with this but we are uh paying attention to it so the answer is not yet and more likely than not not ever but um you know 50 60 bucks I would take a I would take I would start to do real work on it but for now this is a broken growth stock and these things take forever uh I&#39;ll probably be buying it in one and a half to two years a lot lower although Dollar Tree looks better I mean In fairness Dollar General could could snap back but let let me just take a look at the fundamentals I mean I think their com store sales were up 1.4% I had a busy day today so I didn&#39;t get to dig into that one but um let&#39;s see so they started recovering free cash flow Revenue so they must have said something really bad I&#39;m GNA spend some time on this this week because this is my knitting but I really don&#39;t think I would feel I would love to see it puke for another couple days down to like a six handle I mean at 60 bucks even if I buy it at that price and I have to wait three years for it to build a base or two years like we did with Baba and then it goes back to you know 150 or something like that then that that&#39;s a good irr but I think you&#39;re going to have plenty of time to buy it and uh my guess is they&#39;re going to be in the store closing business because this is discretionary versus necessity like Advanced Auto Parts is you don&#39;t go into Advanced Auto Parts you know they don&#39;t have Advanced Auto Parts at the local mall because you want to browse like you do for Lululemon or apple watches uh you go to Advanced Auto Parts because your car is not working and you need to get to work so that&#39;s why we like that part of the turnaround story even though the weekend of the customer is weak um but this could get cheap enough quickly that we would just definitely take a flyer uh we&#39;re just not close to those levels right now and we probably have to do an analysis between them and Dollar Tree and F uh Five Below and all those guys and see which is that got in this pull position because when a when a sector is dislocated meaningfully we like to buy the highest quality in the most dislocated kind of like 2022 when we were buying Banks and energy we bought Exxon and we bought uh Wells Fargo uh in China highest quality we bought Alibaba uh and when that sector starts to recover they&#39;re going to do fantastic um and I think it&#39;s gonna be sooner than everyone expects but Philipe you are right on and you&#39;re early will e do you think Advanced Auto Parts can reach a similar evaluation AutoZone no I don&#39;t um I think advance Auto can be a pretty easy double over the next few years and more likely you know even a triple if this guy really runs it right but um AutoZone is a much bigger business and there&#39;s no way this thing is going to be uh 40 bagger you know let let&#39;s just put that to rest I mean I like your optimism will but it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s got a lot of lifting to do we&#39;re we&#39;re looking for a double or triple in a reasonable amount of time and then we&#39;ll look at the financials then and we&#39;ll look at the things maybe we get a four or five bagger if we&#39;re lucky but I don&#39;t think we get from uh you know just to pull these two together quickly here I think uh you got Advance which is you know a two and a half 2 .7 billion business and you have AutoZone which is like 20 times that 54 billion business I I don&#39;t think it&#39;s going to get to a 54 billion business I definitely think it&#39;s getting back I think it&#39;s getting easily not easily but I think it&#39;s getting to to a 10 billion dollar business for sure uh I think they can do that if they do it well and um and we&#39;ll be perfectly happy with that and then when everyone says it&#39;s going to be the next Auto Zone we will be saying sold to you uh said uh just made a statement to thank me for everything thank you for listening onen uh again just a reminder for all these people that applied for the video job gig and didn&#39;t get it video editor uh I do need an admin for all those posts that we talked about early on if you applied for the video job and you want the admin job you will have greater waiting than all the other people applying for the admin job um all right Carrie jessen I&#39;d be interested in you on Foot Locker you often talking about the jockey and Matt Dylan the new CEO came from Ulta Bea Beauty with 16% kager seems to be doing a lot of great things and they have this quar a return to growth and expecting 8% ebit margin in a couple years oh this is interesting uh wow good work car k a a e says by the way their CCO name is Frank Bracken and mentioned on this quarter&#39;s call that quote and while the vulcanized Footwear category remains challenged overall we&#39;re seeing encouraging Trends out of the Vans brand especially through their new school franchise so there you go Foot Locker let&#39;s take a look at some point I don&#39;t want so many retailers I having Advanced Auto par is enough um this has also turned a lot off the bottom so I kind of missed the boat on this so I&#39;ll take a quick look but for me uh I wouldn&#39;t put this in my portfolio if you&#39;re just looking discreetly at this without the context of a portfolio yes they are turning that&#39;s why the stocks doubled revenues are still weak gross margins are still declining uh let&#39;s see free cash flow oh just turned up uh yeah I just don&#39;t think there&#39;s enough upside relative to the risk it&#39;s still going to be a lowquality business that&#39;s going to be cyclical so you&#39;ll probably catch the next cycle but you already miss half the move even if it goes to 60 you have a double I mean from 14 to 16 is a four bagger I just uh not for me no I I don&#39;t like it but I like the fact that you&#39;re on VF with us and I think you&#39;re going to do just fine there over time um Eric Albright if you had no Ali Bob exposure would you consider taking a punt on PDD hell no unreliable or unsustainable uh also given the risk of poorly reported numbers what are your best resources tips on learning how to decode suspicious financials there are books on that um God I read them all probably when I was your age um Google Books on accounting irregularities um I would say this stay out of Chinese stocks except for the biggest and the best that&#39;ll save 90% of your problems with accounting fraud and uh other than that if it looks too good to be true uh you better do your work and you better do your channels checks um but there are techniques for it if that&#39;s the game that you want to play and there are several books uh maybe I&#39;ll post them on the website or something when I think of it um all right AMA okay this is from Bob Gman thank you for your time and education you give every week with lots of other fund managers and analysts predicting the dollars loss of fiat currency status what in your view happens if and when this takes place Bob gesman it&#39;s not going to happen um you&#39;ll consistently be able to get less for the same dollar over time I guarantee you that but you&#39;re not going to lose lose it and everyone else that&#39;s telling you you are they&#39;re either selling Bitcoin gold or books and um the only one that&#39;s going to benefit from taking that framework is the one selling you those things so I would just pass on that flawed framework that um is just not going to happen all right let&#39;s see here uh Matt Hiller says I was wondering why alibab is down 4% when PDD is having bad earnings I just said why because thought it was related to the Chinese consumer what it&#39;s related to is Alibaba is back to ass kicking and um Ronald Ronald I&#39;ll call you about what you had inquired about here&#39;s from Adam Hawk thanks for your question uh AAP number one Co targeted operating margin mid single digits as opposed to competitors AO riy why is he aiming so low uh because it&#39;s been mismanaged for five years plus uh is there fundamental reason for it there probably lower end uh in terms of the consumers and it&#39;s going to take some time to turn that around customers complaining about price not being competitive so they&#39;re not in line and and he says so they sell at higher prices only produce less profits yes because people don&#39;t buy at higher prices and they hadn&#39;t done the proper analysis World pack sale new CEO and third Point pushing but is that enough maybe not for you it&#39;s plenty for me because I&#39;ve done the work so I&#39;d suggest go through the article of the week or even more importantly go through the source materials you listen to the call you read the transcript you determine what&#39;s important you go through the last 12 calls you go through the last public three years of uh of annual reports and then you&#39;ll determine whether it&#39;s worth your dollar of investment that&#39;s where you win is when you go through the work what I try to do here is sh share 10% of my framework to what I do to get you started on the right path But ultimately you just have to put in the leg work in the time it&#39;s like golf you know you can read the best book on golf if you don&#39;t play two times a week and practice two three times a week you are not getting to a single digit handicap but by the way I got my swing back just in time for my chipping to go to but uh it&#39;s all going to come together I will find a way to get to wear my goal by the end of the year even if I&#39;m playing in a snow hat and gloves um appreciate your input doing my best to share your content in Israel all right thank you Adam I&#39;m very grateful for my uh Israeli viewers and listeners and um uh hope everyone is uh doing the best they can over there right now uh okay Sagar been a loyal listen to your podcast two years love your content oh no okay yeah so have her apply for the um all right never mind James ran okay that&#39;s for the video Brett what are your thoughts on top golf Callaway modg uh disaster they uh they&#39;re struggling with the um they&#39;ve got a good driver Paradigm other than that um from what I understand I don&#39;t play Callaway but um they&#39;re getting they&#39;re getting hit on the top golf piece and shutting a lot down I this has always been a garbage business the ticker used to be El I would never buy this business it&#39;s a it&#39;s a terrible business so um even though the demographic should be favor favorable see I still type in e y o g call me if it gets well it&#39;s already getting below 10 I was gonna say call me if it gets below 10 it&#39;s already there um I won&#39;t buy this business this is a trading vehicle so if it gets back down to like seven and a half or five buy it and just sit on it and sell it when it gets back up to 20 I I don&#39;t their margins continue to deteriorate th this is a garbage business don&#39;t go into the golf equipment business if you can avoid it um that&#39;s it we&#39;ll be back next week same time same place in the meantime make it a great one bye for now oh [Music] [Music] [Music] have a great long exciting holiday weekend
