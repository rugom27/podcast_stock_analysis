### N/A

He also highlights Boeing and Advanced Auto Parts as turnaround stories. He believes gridlock in Washington is good for the markets.

**Tom's Current Market Conviction: Cautiously Optimistic → 7/10** 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥☆☆☆

- Election year seasonality suggests strength into early September, followed by volatility.
- Expected Fed rate cuts provide a tailwind, but the initial cut may lead to short-term weakness.
- Underlying strength in earnings power supports a year-end rally.

## Macro Thesis & Key Data Points
The market is transitioning from being driven by a few large tech companies to a broader base of stocks. Fed rate cuts will favor small caps, emerging markets, and dividend payers. A weaker dollar will further support international stocks and emerging markets. Gridlock in Washington is viewed as a positive for the markets.

| Indicator | Value | Tom's Interpretation |
|-----------|-------|----------------------|
| Small Cap Outperformance | Historically outperform large caps by 11% in the 12 months following the first rate cut. | Small caps are poised to benefit from the expected Fed rate cuts and reacceleration of earnings growth. |
| Earnings Growth Divergence | Mag 7 earnings growth decelerating from 30% to 18%, while unmagnify accelerating. | Indicates a shift in market leadership from large tech to a broader range of companies. |
| Mortgage Rates | Potential for 30-year fixed mortgage rates to fall to a five handle. | This could lead to a surge in housing supply as baby boomers list their homes, creating a more realistic buying market. |
| China Industrial Production | Up 5.3% year-on-year. | Sign of recovery in China, benefiting related sectors like copper. |
