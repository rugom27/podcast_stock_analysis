[0.68s] welcome to hedge fun tips with Tom Hayes
[3.48s] I&#39;m Tom Hayes and this is your
[6.04s] 254th videoast podcast for the week
[8.679s] ending August 29 2024 we&#39;ll kick it off
[12.4s] with some pictures and some family stuff
[13.92s] then we&#39;ll get right down to it last
[15.719s] week&#39;s podcast was absolutely incredible
[19.039s] with special guest Brendan Ahern who
[21.08s] runs the kweb China internet ETF if you
[23.599s] didn&#39;t get a chance to listen to it over
[25.48s] the weekend I would suggest you spend
[27.16s] the time and listen to it Go On A Long
[28.92s] Walk go on a long bike ride it was
[31.48s] awesome this week I&#39;m going to try to
[33.239s] cut that in more than half and do a
[35.12s] short one because I know everyone wants
[36.52s] to get away for the holidays but we do
[38.16s] have a lot of important stuff to cover
[39.84s] so we&#39;re going to get right down to it
[41.68s] first and foremost want to let everyone
[44.16s] know I&#39;m going to need a new admin that
[46.52s] does all the posts on the blog every day
[49.199s] the uh indicator of the day the where is
[52.28s] money flowing uh on Thursdays you&#39;d be
[55.6s] very busy doing all the syndication of
[57.84s] the article of the week onto substack
[60.92s] and talk markets and Seeking Alpha you
[63.6s] basically copy and paste it onto
[66.28s] LinkedIn uh uh and then the earnings
[69.32s] reports uh by sector we teach you how to
[72.32s] do that basically once you figure it all
[74.08s] out it&#39;s literally 5 to seven hours a
[76.24s] week uh you need to be around midday to
[79.32s] do some of the live postings between 10:
[81.119s] a.m. and 2 pm so probably ideal for
[84.56s] maybe a work uh stay-at-home mom or uh
[87.96s] someone younger who doesn&#39;t have a day
[90.24s] job uh and I think you&#39;ll find it
[92.96s] enjoyable and long lasting the people
[95.68s] that I&#39;ve had had in that position have
[97.88s] lasted a long time and they either go
[99.439s] back to college or they go uh to a
[102.479s] full-time job or whatever it happens to
[104.64s] be but uh we&#39;re going to move on that so
[107.439s] if you&#39;re interested and for all of you

[174.04s] just a tremendous amount of fun this is
[175.28s] at Yahoo finance that&#39;s the whole
[176.92s] control Booth where all the magic
[178.84s] happens on on Tuesday uh behind the
[182.28s] scenes and that&#39;s that then we had over
[185.72s] the weekend the girls got awards for
[188.92s] high point for swimming uh high points
[192.159s] for their age group uh for their team
[195.72s] and that&#39;s Annabelle receiving her medal

[201.84s] picture but that&#39;s Caitlyn and I having
[203.799s] date night while the girls were at
[206.159s] Sleepaway Camp in Pennsylvania so that
[208.84s] was fun we don&#39;t get to do that enough
[210.879s] there was uh Yahoo finance
[213.439s] offices and that was me doing walking
[216.12s] the streets at night to get some
[218.04s] exercise um uh Channel checking that&#39;s
[221.68s] Canada Goose on Fifth Avenue and I&#39;m
[224.2s] taking that picture I think from the van
[226.4s] store I had a great conversation with
[228.2s] the guy in the van store about how well
[232.079s] the Avenue sneaker is doing because like
[235.76s] one of these top skateboarders uses it
[237.64s] so every skateboarder has to have it
[239.319s] it&#39;s kind of like Tony Hawk back in my
[241.04s] day and uh and the new school he can&#39;t
[244.2s] even keep on the Shelf all the kids are
[245.959s] coming in all the parents are coming in
[247.4s] to buy for their kids for school so that
[249.959s] was really good to see and then uh
[253.239s] that&#39;s also Yahoo that&#39;s the high point
[256.44s] okay and then today Kelly
[258.239s] O&#39;Grady uh got to be on the claiming
[260.959s] countdown Fox Business that&#39;s a picture
[263.04s] I also had a picture on Twitter with
[265.6s] Brad Smith the exact same picture at
[267.96s] Yahoo so you can look that up on my
[269.88s] Twitter feed I don&#39;t know where that got
[271.52s] lost in the fold uh but first thing I
[274.16s] want to bring on the Cavuto Coast to
[277.919s] Coast segment from Monday it was
[279.52s] actually two segments one in the
[281.8s] beginning one at the end of the show and
[284.84s] it really covers our whole perspective
[287.96s] for the next few months so I want to
[290.039s] listen in here record uh in the opening
[292.8s] hour and a half or so it looks like we
[294.28s] were going to uh be Off to the Races
[296.28s] then all of a sudden after breaching
[298.16s] that record we have since come down
[300.08s] barely changed on the day what to make
[302.24s] of that of course uh this is a time
[304.28s] where a lot of Traders are trying to
[305.96s] reassess what happens next month with
[307.84s] the Federal Reserve most everyone agrees
[309.759s] that a rate cut is coming what we don&#39;t
[311.52s] know is how big a rate cut it will be
[313.68s] kindly enough uh Thomas Hayes to answer
[315.88s] some of those questions brilliant young
[317.44s] man the chairman and the managing member
[319.0s] great Hill Capital Thomas great to see
[320.919s] you I&#39;m going to get a twofer with you
[322.24s] today so I&#39;m excited let me ask you a
[324.28s] little bit about how the market is
[326.88s] digesting all of this news on the fed
[329.44s] the of course the attention on Nvidia we
[331.4s] got a lot going on this week yeah I
[333.84s] think Friday at Jackson Hole that
[336.199s] confirmed a regime change so with the
[338.479s] FED cutting different groups in the
[340.88s] stock market are going to be able to
[342.44s] outperform for example uh small caps the
[345.319s] first 12 months after the first cut they
[347.96s] tend to outperform large caps by 11 full
[350.8s] percentage points why because most small
[352.96s] caps have leverage on their balance
[354.56s] sheet and when they can refinance at
[356.24s] lower rates they have a a higher
[358.24s] propensity to survive but they
[360.12s] outperform by that much how far does
[362.199s] this go back this goes back to 1955 get
[364.8s] out of town yeah it&#39;s wild and then on
[366.96s] the but haven&#39;t they had a there was
[368.84s] this transition going on yeah um so that
[372.36s] it&#39;s going to go even beyond that yeah
[374.36s] it started in July and then it cooled
[376.639s] off with the Yen carry trade on wine for
[378.759s] 24 hours but it&#39;s interesting the FED
[381.16s] said they they&#39;re going to cut so now
[383.28s] Bank of Japan what did they say now we
[385.36s] can start to raise again so you&#39;re going
[387.12s] to see groups like small cap start to
[389.16s] out perform you&#39;re going to see
[390.12s] International stocks uh start to
[391.759s] outperform as as the Yen carry trade uh
[394.319s] unwinds the dollar weakening rates
[396.36s] coming down dividend payers start to
[398.479s] outperform so what if the yen is becomes
[400.599s] the world&#39;s Premier currency in this
[402.639s] interim um how does that affect us
[404.84s] wouldn&#39;t wouldn&#39;t that be good for us
[406.72s] multinationals and their stocks in an
[408.72s] environment like that yes us
[410.479s] multinationals will do well uh it won&#39;t
[413.44s] become the premier currency because
[415.24s] their demographics don&#39;t support it but
[417.0s] it could strengthen relative to the
[418.72s] dollar in the near we saw a similar
[420.8s] situation in the early 2000s if you
[423.199s] remember emerging markets were were out
[425.479s] small caps were out and then all of a
[427.039s] sudden from 2002 to 2007 you had one of
[430.68s] the biggest rallies in history in
[432.599s] emerging markets in small caps actually
[435.12s] in value over growth we had that
[437.16s] concentration of tech going into that
[439.36s] right so I don&#39;t think Tech is going to
[440.879s] crash I just think they&#39;re going to
[442.36s] underperform because their earnings
[445.24s] growth is decelerating from 30% this
[447.96s] year to 18% next year while the
[451.759s] unmagnify they went from I like that the
[454.199s] Magnificent Seven and the unmagic but
[456.08s] they could be a little bit more
[457.08s] magnificent now right that&#39;s right
[458.8s] they&#39;re they&#39;re going from negative
[459.84s] earnings growth they just inflected to
[461.84s] positive earnings growth that is going
[463.639s] to continue into 2025 so you can see
[466.84s] with the waiting of tech the indices are
[470.72s] a little bit more subdued but under the
[472.68s] surface there&#39;s a tremendous amount of
[474.4s] money to be made in individual high
[476.56s] quality companies that are temporarily
[477.96s] marked down now and I think reports
[480.319s] Wednesday after closing bell and and
[482.28s] normally it&#39;s been a good trade to buy
[484.68s] up ahead of an earnings announcement
[486.199s] because it does very well right
[487.319s] afterwards I don&#39;t know how long that&#39;s
[488.479s] held to be honest what do you expect
[490.599s] this time I&#39;ll tell you it&#39;s priced for
[492.879s] Perfection yeah I think that they&#39;ll
[495.08s] probably have good earnings but the the
[497.28s] analysts are saying they got to beat
[499.0s] Revenue by $2 billion in order to move
[502.28s] the needle they&#39;ve got to raise guidance
[504.199s] by at least $2 billion people are a
[506.36s] little worried about the Blackwell delay
[508.24s] the new chip delay by mon want gu but if
[511.68s] you I was I&#39;m old school I was always
[514.08s] taught if you bu high quality assets
[516.08s] when they&#39;re reasonable valuations good
[518.0s] things tend to happen over time this is
[519.839s] trading at 29 times sales $3.2 trillion
[525.36s] valuation just to put that in
[526.56s] perspective our entire GDP is 25
[529.279s] trillion Nvidia is 3.2 the upside
[532.8s] potential in your eyes is limited it&#39;s a
[534.64s] little more what about those who are
[536.0s] existing Nvidia shareholders and have
[538.32s] been riding this way would you tell them
[540.16s] to cash out with part some of the shares
[543.04s] look you you will have time okay so even
[545.76s] if the if the report came in poorly I
[548.079s] don&#39;t I don&#39;t know that it will because
[549.32s] we did see from the hyperscalers a lot
[551.04s] of demand for spend I think what we&#39;re
[553.6s] what we&#39;re also seeing is margins are
[555.44s] declining for the Magnificent 7 because
[557.56s] of all that spend and at some point like
[559.88s] you you remember Mark Zucker Brook with
[562.36s] uh meta he said I&#39;m going to invest all
[564.0s] this money in the metaverse and then all
[565.44s] of a sudden the shareholders said we
[567.04s] don&#39;t like that and they took the stock
[568.48s] down below $100 all of a sudden he says
[570.44s] you know what I&#39;m no longer going to
[571.92s] invest that much in the metaverse and
[573.2s] the stock went back up I think we&#39;re
[574.68s] seeing a similar situation but he&#39;s
[576.279s] actually one of the St performers of the
[577.92s] meta yeah because he stopped all this
[580.079s] all the spend on meta and I think
[582.279s] investors are starting to ask where&#39;s
[583.68s] the return on investment for all this AI
[585.68s] spend on Nvidia chips and that&#39;s not a
[588.519s] today story but as margins decelerate a
[591.0s] couple quarters out and I think the
[592.56s] Market&#39;s starting to see that uh we
[595.0s] could see a situation where the spend
[596.8s] for NVIDIA chips slows down and more
[599.36s] competition comes up for for the GPU
[601.519s] chips from other companies real quickly
[603.36s] on the political race and how that&#39;s
[605.24s] factoring in normally gets to be a big
[606.959s] issue after Labor Day in October yeah um
[610.12s] we were getting a lot of minations much
[611.8s] earlier this year I don&#39;t know if that
[613.279s] has anything to do with the race but
[614.88s] what do you think okay election year
[617.279s] seasonality going back to World War II
[620.079s] we see strength on average through early
[623.399s] to mid-september this year that happens
[625.64s] to coincide with the first cut which
[627.959s] historically it&#39;s sell the first cut so
[630.0s] you have the election year seasonality
[632.0s] which gets a little choppy in late
[633.399s] September early October and sell the
[635.8s] first cut so we think we&#39;ll Cruise along
[638.0s] here for a few weeks maybe we&#39;ll get to
[640.12s] New highs across the board and then get
[642.2s] a little conservative before the
[643.48s] election I think year and rally after
[645.0s] the election hang on to that brilliant
[646.68s] th because I do want to pursue this
[647.92s] election thing with you because there&#39;s
[649.0s] a raging debate going who takes credit
[650.88s] when the markets go up who gets it when
[652.44s] it goes down more Thomas Hayes in just a
[654.72s] second we were mentioning this
[656.079s] presidential race and where it sorts out
[658.279s] we&#39;re getting indication right all right
[660.76s] to here Donald Trump tell it markets go
[662.32s] up it&#39;s because of him when they go down
[663.8s] it&#39;s because of the other guy or gal
[666.079s] bottom line is it&#39;s not quite that B
[668.48s] white but but back with Thomas Hayes on
[670.76s] on what factors the markets could be
[673.04s] looking for and you were raising
[674.839s] something interesting during the break
[676.12s] it&#39;s not about who&#39;s at the top when it
[679.279s] comes to the White House but the makeup
[680.92s] of Washington explain empirically if you
[683.76s] look back throughout history the stock
[685.959s] market performs best when one party does
[688.72s] not have have the executive the Senate
[691.16s] and the house so what the markets really
[692.959s] want to see is gridlock and what that is
[694.92s] is a check on power in simple terms the
[698.8s] less the politicians can do the better
[701.12s] it is for the markets let the markets be
[702.839s] free let business be free and and that
[705.04s] will power things through and the stock
[706.56s] market performs best in those
[708.2s] environments now I was looking into a
[710.2s] little bit of the history on this it&#39;s
[711.72s] ideal if it&#39;s a democrat in the White
[713.8s] House and the house Andor Senate are
[715.519s] under Republican control or both and it
[717.32s] has happened um that was a an ideal
[719.76s] environment under Bill Clinton um how do
[722.44s] you see it going now and what would be
[724.639s] the ideal environment now well that is
[728.0s] true empirically some of that was
[729.6s] demographically based but if I was going
[731.92s] to write a book on how to cause a Great
[734.56s] Depression the first chapter would be
[736.36s] entitled start taxing unrealized capital
[739.12s] gains I mean you can&#39;t make this up who
[740.92s] thinks of this that that you would run
[742.6s] on that platform so uh the the number
[745.519s] one thing that we want you&#39;re talking
[746.8s] about kamla Harris&#39;s plan kamla Harris
[749.32s] plan like you can&#39;t imagine you have one
[751.959s] candidate that&#39;s Pro bus you have one
[754.04s] candidate that&#39;s Pro just taking aside
[756.48s] the politics out of it just from an
[758.36s] economic standpoint the platforms of
[760.24s] what&#39;s going to be better for employment
[762.0s] what&#39;s going to be better for the
[763.04s] economy I mean if you started taxing
[764.8s] unrealized capital gains and people
[766.6s] grasping for liquidity it would be the
[768.6s] quickest way to a Great Depression
[770.0s] normally you ta your capital gains once
[772.12s] you the trade is commenced and all of
[773.839s] that but if this would be obviously
[775.32s] people would be less acclaiming at the
[776.399s] markets now Democrats could come back
[778.279s] and say well that&#39;s not our cup of te we
[780.56s] don&#39;t like the markets uh but it&#39;s
[782.8s] interesting you chose that issue rather
[785.48s] than her wanting to raise the corporate
[787.6s] tax rate to
[788.8s] 28% well we&#39;ve been there uh there right
[792.04s] we&#39;ve been there the corporate ta a lot
[793.639s] higher we were at 35 I mean let&#39;s be
[796.04s] fair some people like to borrow and
[797.56s] spend politicians some people like to
[799.24s] tax and spend politicians the key is all
[801.399s] politicians like to spend that&#39;s how
[802.92s] they retain their power so so that&#39;s
[805.0s] that&#39;s a risk but uh in terms of uh the
[808.44s] market in terms terms of uh corporate
[810.16s] tax rates it still has to get through
[812.0s] Congress so they&#39;ve got to have a grand
[813.88s] slam Senate house and executive branch
[816.44s] to push that through so the Market&#39;s
[817.8s] kind of like okay 28% you&#39;re not going
[819.639s] to get it uh even if you&#39;re elected as
[821.839s] long as there are checks and balances
[823.04s] the markets and the economy will be okay
[824.839s] what do you think I&#39;ve talked to a lot
[825.92s] of people from the markets Tom who say
[828.76s] uh Donald Trump is far more Market
[831.36s] friendly issues wise than he was as a
[833.36s] president than Joe Biden or what we hear
[836.279s] out of K Harris but their big pause is
[839.68s] he&#39;s crazy and he&#39;ll do crazy things and
[842.519s] that will defeat all the other good
[844.36s] stuff he&#39;s doing and that gives them
[846.24s] their trepidation is that justified okay
[848.639s] this is hysterical so when Trump was
[850.399s] elected everyone said energy stocks are
[852.639s] going to do incredible China stocks are
[855.079s] going to collapse and solar stocks are
[857.0s] going to collapse the exact opposite
[859.16s] happened energy stocks dramatically
[861.04s] underperformed under Trump they did well
[863.079s] under bid China had one of its biggest
[865.279s] rallies uh uh during the Trump
[867.36s] Administration and solar stocks did well
[869.24s] what&#39;s happened under Biden energy
[870.92s] stocks have done well Chinese stocks
[873.12s] have collapsed they thought he would be
[874.279s] weak on China he was tougher on China
[875.92s] Trump just wanted to do a deal with
[877.199s] China he saids we&#39;re going to T tariff
[879.079s] you 60% and then he brings them to the
[881.24s] table they cut a deal he wants to make
[882.639s] money he wants to do business he wants
[883.92s] to create jobs for Americans uh and and
[886.92s] uh and so the obvious quid pro don&#39;t
[889.279s] always pan out just like under Barack
[891.079s] Obama that the drug makers and then the
[892.92s] big pharmaceutical companies would tank
[894.759s] they soared under him so sometimes goes
[897.519s] against pattern how do you see it going
[900.6s] uh if if if Donald Trump were to return
[904.16s] well I think the Trump trade would be
[905.6s] back I think what we saw after he was
[907.72s] elected uh 2016 you saw small caps start
[910.56s] to outperform you saw Industrials out
[912.72s] outperform you start to the market
[915.0s] started to price in A Better Tax
[917.32s] environment uh which increases earnings
[919.68s] look if you move the corporate tax rate
[921.24s] up to 28% that&#39;s going to have an impact
[923.519s] on earnings per share so then if you
[925.8s] don&#39;t get multiple expansion you&#39;re
[927.56s] going to have the market St falling on
[929.72s] on the basis of lower earnings so I
[931.88s] think that initially the market will
[935.8s] like the idea also of no Wars under the
[938.88s] Trump Administration there were there
[940.279s] were no real geopolitical wars it was
[942.839s] relatively peaceful geopolitical
[944.6s] environment you don&#39;t have to worry
[945.68s] right now we&#39;ve got kind of too far so
[947.079s] they&#39;d lose sight of some of the crazier
[949.0s] features uh in the case of kamla Harris
[952.079s] they would dread some of that but again
[954.04s] if she&#39;s held in check by a republican
[956.88s] Congress house or Senate it&#39;s it&#39;s
[959.079s] another game right yeah look at the end
[961.079s] of the day earnings power is strong we
[963.0s] we have projections of 15% earnings
[965.319s] growth next year that&#39;s likely going to
[967.16s] come around in the ballpark irrespective
[969.079s] of who&#39;s elected is that right the the
[971.079s] the key is going to be the policies
[973.72s] moving forward and then the Outlook
[975.399s] moving forward on the basis of those
[976.839s] policies so if you could say if you have
[978.759s] Pro bus policies then 2026 looks a lot
[981.399s] better than prover policies 2026 maybe
[984.0s] starts to look a little bit worse
[985.319s] depending who&#39;s elected in which case
[987.199s] the market will begin to price that
[989.24s] after the election uh but on balance uh
[992.319s] given the seasonality of election years
[994.0s] as we touched on I think a little
[995.92s] choppiness in October and we probably
[997.959s] will get a year-end rally just because
[999.56s] of the underlying strength and more
[1000.92s] likely than not whoever&#39;s elected we&#39;re
[1002.72s] going to wind up with gridlock and
[1003.959s] that&#39;s a good thing for the stock market
[1005.48s] well watch closely Tom great catching up
[1007.44s] with you Thomas Hayes following all of
[1009.44s] that uh one thing we left out with Tom
[1011.759s] is real
[1013.12s] estate and we&#39;re back and then I got to
[1016.199s] join Brad Smith uh who I just mentioned
[1019.199s] at Yahoo we had a great talk about
[1022.279s] Nvidia and all the other factors going
[1025.12s] into year end prior to Nvidia earnings
[1028.72s] and what we were saying might happen but
[1031.079s] first the fed&#39;s path forward here the
[1032.88s] central bank is expected to lower
[1034.919s] interest rates in September as inflation
[1037.72s] moderates and the job market sees signs
[1039.959s] of cooling so how should you be
[1042.079s] positioning your portfolio ahead of rate
[1044.0s] Cuts here to weigh in in studio we&#39;ve
[1046.039s] got Tom Hayes he is the great Hill
[1048.199s] Capital chair chairman and managing
[1050.48s] member here great to have you here with
[1052.039s] us in studio so first and foremost what
[1054.96s] type of pivot should investors be
[1058.039s] positioning for especially going into
[1060.72s] this first potential cut here come
[1062.919s] September as we&#39;re all expecting well I
[1065.32s] think Brad we&#39;ve got some seasonality
[1067.24s] factors at play in an election year
[1069.36s] since 1955 we generally have pretty good
[1073.76s] strength into early September into
[1076.6s] mid-september and then as we get closer
[1078.48s] to the election we get a little
[1079.84s] volatility late September October that
[1082.12s] happens to coincide with the first cut
[1085.159s] mid September and historically uh the
[1088.32s] first two three weeks after the first
[1090.36s] cut tends to be a little bit weaker so
[1092.28s] you you have the headwinds so I think
[1094.44s] you dance while the music&#39;s playing
[1096.2s] right now I think we&#39;re going to get uh
[1098.559s] probably some new highs we saw in the
[1099.96s] Dow yesterday uh we&#39;ll see what happens
[1101.96s] with Nvidia tomorrow maybe the S&amp;P and
[1104.2s] the NASDAQ will catch up a little bit
[1106.0s] and then I think as you look at all
[1107.84s] those profits and your smiling so wide
[1109.6s] you could eat a banana sideways in early
[1111.2s] September you say wait a second Cuts
[1113.44s] coming election volatility coming and
[1115.4s] maybe Harvest a few profits have a
[1116.919s] little cash on the sidelines late
[1118.28s] October deploy into urine rally you know
[1120.36s] it&#39;s really interesting because I I
[1121.96s] hesitate to ever cast any doubt on
[1123.88s] Nvidia especially in this day and age
[1125.52s] and in this market right now and in the
[1127.159s] performance that they&#39;ve exhibited but
[1128.919s] those Nvidia earnings are going to be
[1130.2s] out Wednesday that report itself if it
[1133.28s] is a dud then what does that signal for
[1136.52s] the back half of this year well
[1138.919s] initially because of the weight 6% 7%
[1141.84s] depending on the index initially you&#39;ll
[1143.6s] get some weakness but what we have seen
[1146.28s] since we got some clarity that the fed&#39;s
[1147.96s] going to be cutting is a regime change
[1150.12s] that started in July was temporarily
[1152.96s] impaired by the Yen carry trade on wine
[1155.44s] for a minute until boj relented and say
[1157.64s] wait we&#39;ll we&#39;ll wait to raise rates
[1159.88s] until the FED actually starts cutting so
[1161.48s] we don&#39;t get the liquidity mismatch um
[1164.36s] so I I think the focus is uh take the
[1168.76s] shift is going to be from large caps to
[1171.559s] small caps large caps underperform small
[1174.799s] caps in the first 12 months after a cut
[1177.28s] by 11% so small caps outperform by 11%
[1180.32s] and that&#39;s also consistent with earnings
[1182.0s] growth so this year small caps are
[1183.559s] expected to grow earnings at 7% next
[1185.96s] year 37% and and uh mag 7 earnings
[1189.919s] growth decelerates from 30% this year
[1192.0s] down to 18% next year so so if Nvidia it
[1196.24s] does less well than people think I think
[1198.12s] you&#39;re going to start to see a lot of
[1199.36s] the stocks under the surface start to
[1201.6s] pick up the slack so even if mag 7
[1203.96s] underperforms uh you can make a
[1205.52s] tremendous amount of money under the
[1206.88s] surface just to just to put a fine point
[1208.559s] on this as well here I mean the
[1209.76s] information technology sector and
[1211.72s] according some to some data from fax set
[1214.12s] information techology is the reporting
[1216.72s] the second highest year-over-year
[1218.0s] earnings growth rate of all 11 sectors
[1220.44s] at 18.9% right now and Nvidia is the
[1224.039s] largest contributor to year-over-year
[1225.84s] growth right now so for investors trying
[1228.24s] to figure out whether or not even given
[1230.679s] the runup that we&#39;ve seen in Nvidia this
[1232.52s] is still a ripe investment opportunity
[1235.72s] what would you say to them okay it&#39;s
[1237.28s] nuanced I think the earnings are going
[1238.679s] to be okay tomorrow the reason is we saw
[1240.44s] all the hyperscalers were spending like
[1242.0s] crazy that&#39;s why their margins are going
[1243.84s] down the Magnificent margins are going
[1245.28s] down earnings growth is going down
[1246.52s] because they&#39;re giving all the money to
[1248.12s] Nvidia uh I think there&#39;s going to come
[1250.0s] a time where investors say where&#39;s the
[1253.039s] return on our investment that&#39;s two
[1254.559s] quarters out but right now Nvidia is
[1256.6s] price for Perfection uh 3.2 $2 trillion
[1259.64s] valuation our entire GDP is 28 trillion
[1262.24s] so you&#39;re saying it&#39;s worth 11% of our
[1264.08s] total GDP like trees don&#39;t grow to the
[1266.12s] sky it can grow a little higher but you
[1268.48s] have to keep in mind uh 28 times sales
[1272.08s] is pretty rich 37 times earnings is
[1274.4s] pretty rich yes you&#39;d say the earnings
[1276.08s] growth is 38% long-term growth but then
[1278.32s] you look at the numbers and it just
[1279.48s] doesn&#39;t make sense because Rule of 72 is
[1281.88s] it really going to double every two
[1283.12s] years that would imply it&#39;s going to be
[1284.559s] half a GDP before we know it uh doesn&#39;t
[1287.48s] make a lot of sense all right while we
[1289.279s] have you here just lastly because there
[1290.96s] are a lot of people who were trying to
[1292.48s] figure this one out and and you have
[1294.24s] some thoughts on it as well Boeing
[1295.559s] Boeing has a windy road of challenges
[1297.72s] that we&#39;ve seen over the course of this
[1298.88s] year the stock is down what 33% year-to
[1301.679s] date I think we have a chart we can toss
[1302.919s] up for the viewers at home do you see
[1304.559s] this as a buying opportunity I think
[1306.2s] it&#39;s phenomenal Kelly ortberg came from
[1308.36s] Rockwell Collins when he got involved
[1309.919s] with Rockwell Collins it was a$7 billion
[1311.799s] doll company six years later he sold it
[1313.64s] to for $30 billion four and a half
[1316.24s] bagger this guy knows how to run
[1317.64s] business the second thing is he&#39;s
[1319.32s] actually an engineer so for the F first
[1321.12s] time in a while we get to have Boeing
[1322.559s] run by an actual engineer versus a
[1324.559s] Salesman uh which is helpful when you
[1326.36s] want to keep doors on planes and keep
[1327.96s] thing you know fuselages together and
[1329.48s] all that stuff that&#39;s important uh but
[1331.32s] the key thing is it operates in a
[1332.88s] duopoly okay so at the end of the day
[1334.76s] you can say I don&#39;t like Boeing they&#39;ve
[1336.36s] been sloppy the last few years okay
[1338.039s] we&#39;ll get online at Airbus and you can
[1339.48s] wait 20 years for your next plane
[1341.08s] they&#39;ve got 6,000 plus backlog they just
[1343.799s] said oh by the way we underestimated the
[1345.44s] demand because China&#39;s uh China&#39;s flying
[1347.64s] is picking up the middle class is
[1349.039s] growing uh they&#39;re going to need another
[1350.64s] 8,000 planes so what you like to see
[1353.08s] with stocks that have Relentless
[1355.08s] everyday bad news is that they sto going
[1357.76s] down and that&#39;s happened to Boeing in
[1359.44s] the last few weeks uh headlines have
[1361.4s] been bad every single day and the stock
[1362.76s] stopped going down NASA saying that
[1364.88s] they&#39;re going to use SpaceX it couldn&#39;t
[1366.279s] get any worse like like you couldn&#39;t
[1368.159s] make this stuff up every single day they
[1369.84s] screw something up and the stock has
[1371.44s] stopped going down which tells you that
[1373.12s] most of the problems are in the rearview
[1374.559s] mirror Kelly ortberg is going to turn
[1376.32s] around this ship the duopoly is in place
[1379.0s] the backlog of over a decade is in place
[1381.24s] so we like this as a high quality
[1382.72s] business that&#39;s temporarily impaired
[1384.36s] yeah I should just clarify as well for
[1386.6s] those who are are viewing as well and
[1388.88s] you know the full story on the NASA the
[1390.84s] as well NASA&#39;s astronauts they used
[1393.08s] Boeing and Starliner to get them up
[1395.039s] there uh to the ISS and now we&#39;re trying
[1397.48s] to get them back and they&#39;re going to
[1399.76s] SpaceX for that anyway all these things
[1401.36s] considered still a Boeing story Tom
[1403.12s] you&#39;re still great great Hill Capital
[1405.159s] chairman and managing member Tom Hayes
[1407.2s] great to see you thanks so much
[1408.48s] apprciate it and then today I got to
[1412.4s] speak to Kelly
[1414.24s] ogrady uh my new nickname for her is
[1417.0s] Kelly o great g a t y I think she&#39;s
[1420.44s] doing a phenomenal job over at Fox
[1422.0s] Business and was happy to get on the
[1424.88s] show uh we covered Nvidia after the fact
[1429.76s] and the regime change we&#39;ve been
[1431.96s] consistently speaking about publicly
[1433.88s] that&#39;s starting to take shape in Earnest
[1436.48s] so we&#39;re going to listen in here brought
[1438.24s] up the the Blackwell chip piece cuz Tom
[1439.88s] I want to bring you in here on this
[1441.72s] right I know that that&#39;s something that
[1443.12s] you were watching closely to kind of get
[1445.039s] a sense of are are they going to elay
[1448.0s] fears right CEO Jensen Wong he said look
[1450.279s] we&#39;re still expecting revenue from this
[1452.279s] chip um in in 2024 was it enough for you
[1455.96s] I don&#39;t think so you know when I hear
[1457.6s] about watch parties for NVIDIA I I mean
[1460.12s] this thing was priced for Perfection
[1461.48s] it&#39;s like the inmates are running the
[1462.72s] Asylum this business is is valued at $3
[1465.48s] trillion the entire US GDP is 20
[1468.559s] trillion and here&#39;s what&#39;s better
[1470.24s] estimates of 40% long-term growth rate
[1473.44s] that implies the business is going to
[1474.799s] double every 2 years so in four years it
[1477.039s] would be worth $12 trillion or half of
[1479.96s] GDP I think it&#39;s a great business I
[1481.96s] think it&#39;s going to grow I think there&#39;s
[1483.24s] going to be demand I think price is what
[1485.279s] you pay value is what you get and 29
[1487.52s] times sales is not interesting to me
[1489.559s] yeah no I mean look I hear you it&#39;s a
[1491.279s] great business suan pointed it out if if
[1493.2s] you have big tech companies saying
[1494.84s] spending spending spending it&#39;s clearly
[1496.52s] going to keep growing I&#39;m just bring out
[1498.96s] uh Scott you know jobless claims out
[1500.76s] today better than expected pce out
[1503.0s] tomorrow um the rate Cup&#39;s coming we&#39;re
[1505.279s] on Dow record watch a lot of Traders are
[1507.88s] fading this rally where do you stand on
[1510.919s] that I I agree with that and and not so
[1513.72s] much fading it because you know things
[1516.72s] are dire or things are bad but I think
[1519.399s] we&#39;ve certainly come so far so quickly
[1522.64s] since those lows three or so weeks ago
[1524.96s] and listen volatility is not going away
[1526.919s] obviously with the election just few
[1528.52s] months away with the FED in in 3 weeks
[1531.159s] and then we get the FED again early
[1532.88s] November volatility is there so when you
[1535.76s] have an opportunity to buy some
[1538.559s] protection in the marketplace with vixs
[1540.52s] now down back around 15 or so there&#39;s no
[1543.799s] reason not to do that so I don&#39;t know a
[1546.159s] lot of these guys back here and I talk
[1548.0s] to them all the all the time throughout
[1550.159s] the day that are shorting the market as
[1552.399s] much as they are hedging the market
[1554.88s] because there is an opportunity to hedge
[1556.64s] the market right now that&#39;s a Point sort
[1558.88s] of great context there Scott I Tom I I
[1561.2s] just want to bring you in here to end um
[1563.559s] R cuts are coming right a lot of our
[1565.76s] viewers are probably sitting in money
[1567.6s] markets thinking when do I get in when
[1569.559s] do I take advantage of this a lot of
[1571.84s] talk about the rotation trade so our
[1574.32s] small caps the place to be looking at as
[1577.2s] you sort of play this out over the rest
[1578.88s] of the year Well history since World War
[1580.76s] II tells us that is the play because uh
[1583.399s] for the 12 month following the First
[1585.72s] Rate cut small caps outperform large
[1587.88s] caps by 11% and that&#39;s consistent with
[1590.88s] what we&#39;re seeing with the deceleration
[1593.24s] of earnings growth of the Magnificent 7
[1595.48s] and the reacceleration of the earnings
[1597.88s] power earnings growth of the
[1599.96s] unmagnify so the top seven they could
[1602.88s] kind of consolidate the gains that
[1604.08s] they&#39;ve had and there are going to be
[1605.36s] tremendous opportunities under the
[1607.039s] surface including small caps including
[1609.12s] dividend payers including emerging
[1610.679s] markets and I mean you know you you see
[1613.0s] that Trend coming in the Russell people
[1614.52s] are excited um we will see gentlemen
[1616.76s] we&#39;re going to have to leave it there
[1617.919s] Tom Scott appreciate your time today
[1620.76s] thank you okay look AI
[1624.08s] uh and we&#39;re back and just to give
[1627.36s] proper acknowledgement want to thank
[1629.559s] kellyo Grady Jake Mack and Katherine
[1632.12s] Myers for having me on the claim and
[1633.679s] countdown Fox Business want to thank
[1635.72s] Brad Smith Sarah Smith and Kristen suban
[1639.6s] for having me on Yahoo finance and want
[1641.76s] to thank Neil Cavuto Jenna Jenna D
[1646.36s] tomases Kevin Fitzgerald and Matt Hassen
[1649.159s] for having me on Cavuto on Monday I will
[1652.279s] be on Varney tomorrow morning Friday the
[1654.919s] 30th at 9:25 a.m. so please tune in if
[1659.039s] you&#39;re available and moving on to the
[1662.08s] quote of the week the intelligent
[1664.0s] investor is a realist who sells to
[1667.039s] Optimist and buys from pessimist and I
[1670.559s] think Nvidia is a good case study of
[1672.72s] this because we&#39;re going to see in a
[1674.44s] minute that fomo kicked in and Retail
[1677.6s] buyers were buying this thing hand over
[1679.48s] fist into earnings uh and you got kind
[1682.559s] of our view from uh kellyo Grady segment
[1685.919s] on what we think about that uh let&#39;s go
[1689.08s] into some data
[1692.039s] here and there&#39;s plenty of stuff to buy
[1694.2s] from pessimist too these days we&#39;re
[1695.64s] going to cover two of them in our oil
[1697.76s] cans and vans stock market and sentiment
[1700.399s] results article of the week uh by the
[1703.2s] way I&#39;ll also be on I don&#39;t know if
[1705.12s] you&#39;ll get this in time cgtn America
[1707.44s] tonight at
[1708.76s] 8m uh if you want to tune into that
[1711.12s] initial jobless claims Rising all this
[1713.159s] is pointing to the market is priced in
[1715.64s] about 100 basis points between now and
[1717.679s] the end of the year backend loaded and
[1720.279s] all this stuff matters uh the shift has
[1723.2s] Focus the focus has shift from inflation
[1725.799s] to jobs and um the jobs report will be
[1730.64s] more important than the pce tomorrow the
[1733.12s] jobs report next Friday will determine
[1735.399s] whether we start with 25 or 5050 I think
[1737.44s] we&#39;re going to start with 25 but we
[1739.36s] could go to 50 quick if the jobs are
[1740.96s] weak or stay at 25 and more likely do 25
[1744.64s] 25 25 before the end of the year uh this
[1749.0s] is all cover for the
[1750.72s] FED next households done with the
[1754.08s] leveraging debt to disposable income
[1757.039s] again is
[1758.279s] near uh all-time lows going all the way
[1761.919s] back 20 years uh Debt Service ratio is
[1765.88s] even goes back maybe 40 50 years so the
[1769.039s] deleveraging began when the great
[1771.32s] financial crisis in 2009 so the consumer
[1774.36s] is in better shape than uh advertised
[1777.24s] but you do have situations where the
[1779.48s] low-end consumer $75,000 and under is in
[1784.36s] pain uh their defaults are going up a
[1787.2s] bit and you saw it in Dollar General
[1789.279s] today getting smashed we&#39;re keeping an
[1791.32s] eye on that one for opportunities but it
[1793.559s] is kind of a similar situation to
[1796.0s] Advanced Auto Parts which is is also the
[1798.76s] lower-end consumer uh getting hit the
[1801.799s] difference between Dollar General and
[1804.24s] Advanced Auto Parts is there are 287
[1807.279s] million vehicles that are average aged
[1809.44s] 12.7 years uh on the road and in order
[1812.64s] for people to drive their job their car
[1814.32s] needs to work so the spend at Advanced
[1817.36s] Auto Parts for the lower-end customer is
[1819.64s] less discretionary than buying Mike and
[1821.919s] IES at Dollar General
[1826.0s] and Advanced Auto Parts priced in the
[1828.6s] worst of the worst Dollar General is a
[1831.24s] massive growth stock that has just begun
[1833.159s] to crack in Earnest uh but we&#39;ll keep an
[1835.799s] eye for possible opportunities I think
[1837.799s] it&#39;s some time
[1839.44s] away number of times the word recession
[1841.799s] was mentioned in earnings calls that&#39;s
[1843.36s] collapsed just like you saw after the
[1844.84s] great financial
[1846.279s] crisis and just like you saw after
[1849.159s] Nvidia uh excuse me just like you saw
[1852.039s] after covid uh S&amp;P Global UK
[1858.0s] manufacturing PMI is is rocketing higher
[1860.799s] that&#39;s what we&#39;ve talked about as far as
[1862.08s] the UK recovery with gxo Etc uh UK
[1866.24s] manufacturing pmis employment same thing
[1869.0s] Services PMI turning back up UK firms
[1871.72s] see faster growth cooler inflation in
[1873.96s] Boon for Boe uh UK consumer confidence
[1877.36s] has rocketed up since T
[1879.96s] 2022 moving on private clients bought
[1883.279s] Reit financials and Tech ETFs in the
[1886.36s] last four weeks they sold Japan they
[1889.2s] sold Healthcare they sold
[1891.559s] Staples uh US dollar breaking below this
[1894.72s] channel this has been core to our thesis
[1896.88s] for everything we&#39;ve been talking about
[1898.919s] what outperforms which we actually
[1900.519s] mentioned with uh kellyo gradon Fox
[1903.6s] Business which was small caps emerging
[1906.48s] markets in our case China and uh
[1909.32s] dividend payers like the Stanley Black &amp;
[1911.36s] Deckers of the world and value as well
[1914.24s] Global junk uh Bond maturity wall
[1917.12s] records an historic decline so everyone
[1919.639s] was worried about refinancing and guess
[1921.96s] what they all got refinanced uh and
[1924.519s] rates are coming down they&#39;re going to
[1925.88s] refinance again and again uh 2024
[1930.08s] already the third largest year for
[1932.12s] policy rate Cuts there have been 84 Cuts
[1935.519s] so far in 2024 which means what which
[1938.84s] means we are going to get a reti a
[1943.32s] reigniting of a global liquidity wave
[1947.48s] that help
[1948.36s] groups like biotech which have had a
[1950.519s] great run and we are enjoying and I
[1953.72s] think it&#39;s going to continue to run for
[1956.0s] a couple more years uh with this just
[1959.88s] beginning Bank of America let&#39;s see here
[1963.919s] 30-year fixed mortgage rates versus
[1966.519s] 10year yields what this is
[1969.08s] saying is that when the spread gets this
[1972.039s] wide mortgage rates collapse that will
[1975.279s] also be good for the generx of the world
[1978.2s] it will be good for the Stanley Black
[1979.679s] and Deckers of the world construction
[1982.72s] Etc um Industrials Etc so there&#39;s
[1986.76s] there&#39;s a lot to do here and you&#39;re
[1988.399s] going to see this absolutely roll over
[1990.96s] in coming months I think we could see a
[1993.12s] five handle back on the 30-year fixed
[1995.799s] rate mortgage which I think is going to
[1999.32s] have a different effect than most people
[2002.039s] think I think most people think that
[2004.08s] when mortgage rates drop housing prices
[2006.559s] are going to go up I I think the
[2008.159s] opposite is true I think when mortgage
[2010.36s] rates drop you&#39;re going to see a massive
[2012.88s] amount of Supply come onto the market
[2015.799s] for people that have been stuck and
[2017.399s] didn&#39;t want to trade out trade out and
[2019.519s] get stuck with a 7% mortgage when
[2021.36s] they&#39;re in a 3% mortgage uh it&#39;s not
[2024.2s] worth taking the double in California
[2026.36s] and moving to Texas or or the triple or
[2029.799s] you know the triple in New York and
[2031.76s] moving to uh you know sou South Carolina
[2035.32s] or something like that um but moving
[2038.399s] from a 3% mortgage to a 5% mortgage
[2041.2s] you&#39;re going to see a lot of baby
[2042.36s] boomers listing you&#39;re going to see an
[2043.76s] abundance of supply and I think that&#39;s
[2045.559s] going to help people who want to be
[2048.2s] buyers for those sellers waiting to be a
[2052.0s] seller you are going to be stuck in a
[2055.079s] crowd right now there is no Supply or
[2057.679s] limited Supply it&#39;s it&#39;s increasing but
[2060.599s] you still have a little bit of power if
[2062.48s] you list I look I&#39;m not a real estate
[2064.679s] agent but I&#39;m just telling you that
[2067.76s] maybe initially you&#39;ll get out if you&#39;re
[2069.52s] trying to sell by waiting for rates to
[2071.599s] go down but shortly thereafter whether
[2074.679s] it&#39;s weeks or months all of a sudden
[2076.52s] you&#39;re going to be competing with like a
[2078.0s] hundred properties in your town and
[2079.96s] you&#39;re going to wish you sold while
[2081.24s] rates were
[2082.32s] High um meaning we may start to see a
[2088.079s] realistic buying Market in the next 6 to
[2090.72s] 12
[2092.079s] months Americans aren&#39;t being laid off
[2094.56s] yet so that&#39;s positive but obviously the
[2096.679s] FED is you know SE the writing on the
[2098.4s] wall and they want to get ahead of it
[2099.839s] which is nice oversold dollar is the
[2102.72s] furthest below the long-term Trend in 13
[2104.64s] months this is just getting started so
[2107.4s] we&#39;re uh again we could have counter
[2109.119s] Trend moves like we talked about last
[2111.079s] week uh so we&#39;re certain then jumbo cut
[2114.16s] ahead in less than two months a 50 basis
[2116.359s] point cut has gone from impossible to
[2118.68s] certain implicit chance of at least one
[2121.079s] cut in 150 basis point cut in 2024 has
[2124.839s] gone up to over 100% that&#39;s kind of mind
[2127.72s] boggling when you think about it uh
[2130.48s] 5year tips yield is collapsed along with
[2133.4s] inflation dollar has collapsed same
[2135.599s] thing all the things that we were
[2137.2s] planning for equal weighted index
[2138.72s] breaking out to new highs while the na
[2140.64s] NASDAQ is showing weakness again things
[2143.44s] that we&#39;ve been talking about tomorrow&#39;s
[2145.16s] newspaper today China 2024 industrial
[2148.2s] production year onye uh 5.3% so this is
[2152.119s] recovering that&#39;s a good thing in China
[2154.04s] the industrial leads the rest here
[2157.16s] Dallas manufacturing is starting to turn
[2159.96s] up uh small caps ratio relative to QQQ
[2165.16s] this has gone up even more since this
[2167.0s] chart uh small cap starting to
[2169.04s] outperform the NASDAQ and why is that
[2171.4s] because earnings are going to outperform
[2174.28s] and in the first 12 months after the
[2177.0s] First Rate cut small caps are up on
[2179.48s] average
[2181.599s] 26.6%
[2183.2s] versus um large caps which are up 15%
[2188.56s] 11% spread we covered that on a couple
[2190.72s] of the shows that&#39;s a big
[2194.28s] deal uh this is from Bank Goldman Sachs
[2197.72s] saying that their estimate of Break Even
[2199.96s] rate of job creation has to be 50%
[2204.2s] otherwise you are that&#39;s uh assuming 1.5
[2207.8s] million net immigration in 2025 if you
[2210.599s] get below 150,000 new jobs created in
[2213.96s] the reports you got a problem Latin
[2216.56s] America earnings Vision ratio is going
[2219.839s] up they troughed in
[2222.24s] 2022 latam is reaccelerating
[2225.319s] dramatically that&#39;s a good sign earnings
[2228.16s] growth here mag 7 versus
[2232.2s] unmagnify uh if you look UNM magnificent
[2234.44s] 493 started the year negative while mag
[2236.599s] 7 was up 50% by this quarter mag 7 was
[2241.48s] 29% uh unmagnify turned positive to plus
[2246.4s] 6% and by the end of of the year we&#39;re
[2247.96s] going to be plus 16% for the unag and
[2250.68s] down to plus 18% for the mag next year
[2254.4s] it uh it goes to 18% for the mag
[2258.28s] 7 um 15% for the S&amp;P overall including
[2262.72s] the mag 7 forward PE ratios you can see
[2265.76s] small cap and midcap are a huge bargain
[2268.96s] relative to large cap and historically
[2272.16s] you can see from 2010 to
[2275.2s] 2018 uh small cap and large cap got the
[2278.079s] premium I&#39;m sorry small cap and midcap
[2280.319s] got the multiple premium over large cap
[2282.359s] that has reversed it will mean revert
[2284.96s] stocks that split tend to be beat the
[2287.44s] index um unless Jensen Wong is selling a
[2290.359s] half a billion dollars of stocks into
[2292.079s] the hungry retail investors right after
[2293.839s] the split and then you get a different
[2295.64s] result and by the way if you can&#39;t get
[2297.96s] enough of Nvidia Jensen Wong will help
[2300.04s] you out he&#39;s got another 80 something
[2302.2s] billion dollars a stock that he&#39;s happy
[2303.96s] to to sell as He adjusted his plan to be
[2306.04s] able to sell more to everyone who wants
[2309.2s] it
[2311.4s] um St S&amp;P
[2314.319s] 500 this is the price rate of change
[2317.68s] from sentiment CH Trader you only see
[2320.28s] these dramatic extremes few times uh in
[2325.04s] in a period of years you got it at the
[2327.52s] bottom in 19 the bottom in 20 or 18
[2330.839s] rather when uh Powell said autopilot and
[2333.44s] then you recently got it on the Yen
[2335.119s] carry trade and now we&#39;re back off Off
[2337.56s] to the Races which is a positive thing
[2339.76s] sector composition of the S&amp;P 500 by
[2342.24s] Equity capitalization it goes by sector
[2344.96s] you can see that Tech is now up uh
[2350.839s] 32% financials is
[2353.8s] 12% and what he&#39;s trying to communicate
[2356.72s] here is all the times that a sector has
[2358.96s] been in a bubble is when it&#39;s over 20%
[2362.76s] so energy in 1980 was
[2365.48s] 26% waiting then you had Tech in 2000
[2370.52s] was 33% waiting then you had financials
[2373.839s] in 2006 and 2007 was 22% waiting so
[2378.72s] right now if you look at what&#39;s got
[2380.24s] heavy waiting infotex got 32% and
[2383.359s] nothing else even comes close so all the
[2385.48s] ones that are down in these low single
[2386.96s] digits expect them to gain more share
[2389.44s] expect Tech to moderate some
[2392.72s] whatat evolution of equity sector
[2395.48s] composition and Bubbles over time
[2398.119s] uh so this just looks at it in a
[2399.68s] different way which is the do was
[2402.88s] 25% then you had housing in that was in
[2406.4s] uh 2000 housing in
[2408.8s] 2029 China in 20072 2008 had a 25%
[2414.2s] waiting that was a bubble uh and now
[2417.04s] these are uh in at the exact opposite
[2421.359s] where Tech is at an extreme 33 and China
[2428.04s] is
[2429.96s] um China&#39;s very low and uh ready for
[2433.16s] mean reversion us durable goods orders
[2435.72s] month- on-month shot the lights out
[2438.0s] highest in four years uh that is
[2441.319s] including Transportation items wink wink
[2444.68s] core durable goods orders X
[2446.599s] Transportation were down 210 of
[2450.44s] 1% this table shows what
[2455.119s] happens to the S&amp;P
[2458.88s] one week two weeks 3 weeks one month 3
[2462.119s] months 6 months one year after the first
[2464.8s] cut and as we&#39;ve been saying number one
[2467.119s] election year seasonality which we&#39;ve
[2468.92s] covered uh points to weaker second half
[2472.44s] of September and October followed by a
[2476.2s] yearend rally that&#39;s election year
[2478.839s] cyclicality and then if you look
[2480.96s] compound that with uh the uh first three
[2485.56s] weeks you know certain first two weeks
[2488.56s] show weakness on average up to the first
[2491.52s] three weeks after the first cut and then
[2493.68s] as you get three months out six months
[2496.24s] out one year out you tend to get uh more
[2500.0s] meaningful upsides so that&#39;s positive uh
[2504.2s] S&amp;P and first cut historically so little
[2507.24s] weakness and Then followed by strength
[2509.319s] that&#39;s from renmac durable goods orders
[2511.8s] you can just see here visually how
[2513.319s] dramatic that was uh orders for
[2515.839s] transportation equipment Skyrocket this
[2518.839s] is an interesting thing worldwide dating
[2521.28s] apps monthly active users have
[2523.319s] absolutely collapsed from 155 million
[2526.8s] pre in uh 2021 during covid now down to
[2531.599s] 135 million which is pretty anemic I
[2535.44s] guess everyone Found Love online during
[2538.68s] covid pending sales of starter homes up
[2542.2s] double
[2543.319s] digits starter home Inventory sores
[2546.079s] outpacing growth and tears we talked
[2548.839s] about this for many many months we said
[2551.4s] that the new theme was going to be not
[2553.24s] everyone needed to live in a 7,000
[2554.92s] square foot starter home people could
[2556.96s] actually start in one in 2,000 square
[2558.96s] feet houses like levit Town post World
[2561.319s] War II when we had another demographic
[2563.76s] boom just like we&#39;re having now which is
[2565.88s] going to drive the economy and equities
[2568.68s] through the end of this decade and
[2570.52s] probably into the beginning of next
[2572.68s] decade the Roaring 20s I believe will be
[2575.68s] a slight understat
[2577.76s] mag 7&#39;s contribution to the S&amp;P 500 EPS
[2581.16s] growth started to shrink as the other
[2583.4s] 493 came out of its earnings season
[2587.559s] that&#39;s the name of the game that&#39;s The
[2589.04s] Core theme if you understand that you&#39;re
[2590.76s] going to have a very happy 24 months
[2593.96s] Futures implied fed terminal rate is
[2596.2s] down to 3% which implies what implies a
[2600.16s] mortgages with a for handle it also
[2603.64s] implies um
[2607.96s] nine cuts which would be a lot I&#39;m not
[2610.44s] sure if they&#39;re going to need all that
[2611.599s] but they may very well I could see a
[2614.76s] situation where they do four Cuts or
[2618.0s] three or four cuts and then you get a
[2620.52s] three and a half% inflation print and
[2623.119s] they stop cutting and they keep the
[2625.28s] terminal rate at four and they let
[2628.359s] inflation run between three and four for
[2630.319s] the next five years and you&#39;re going to
[2631.92s] wake up and whoever is President is
[2633.8s] going to say I&#39;m a genius debt to GDP is
[2636.68s] only 80% it used to be
[2639.24s] 120% Pat myself on the back trying not
[2641.88s] to break my hand and um and they&#39;ll take
[2644.8s] credit for it but a lot more of it has
[2646.8s] to do with demographics and being in the
[2648.4s] right place in the right time than them
[2650.44s] controlling their spending because
[2652.64s] politicians like to spend Prime book
[2655.4s] Global
[2656.44s] equities um monthly notional trading
[2659.48s] flows so they&#39;re short out the Wazoo
[2662.64s] just like they were in the hole in 2020
[2665.359s] so be mindful of that consumer board com
[2669.2s] consumer confidence is turning up Rises
[2672.559s] on views of economy and inflation up to
[2675.16s] 103.3 from
[2677.44s] 101.9 dollar we showed that already
[2680.04s] dollar to yen broke this key trend line
[2682.839s] expect this trend to persist what
[2684.839s] happens after you break the trend a lot
[2686.24s] of times you go test the line again to
[2688.319s] fake people out and then over to sler at
[2691.72s] RBC let&#39;s take a look at the big picture
[2694.16s] here weekly technical chart book that
[2697.119s] that is from two days ago which is about
[2700.48s] the same as right now S&amp;P knocking on
[2703.16s] knocking on the door knocking on Heaven
[2705.119s] door here I think we go to new highs
[2707.4s] before midep and before rolling over I
[2710.52s] think you got to get everyone in the
[2711.96s] boat and then you open the trap door
[2714.76s] September and October when everyone
[2716.44s] thinks everything is
[2718.64s] perfect um NASDAQ similar thing maybe
[2722.96s] NASDAQ makes new highs too I would
[2724.72s] imagine so um
[2730.28s] you know that is going to be a harder
[2732.119s] question because you saw today the Dow
[2734.319s] and the Russell doing really well while
[2736.16s] NASDAQ and Tech weigh uh and Nvidia
[2739.4s] Weighing on the S&amp;P so we&#39;ll we&#39;ll see
[2741.319s] jurries out on that uh equal weight
[2744.079s] breaking out to new highs already
[2746.28s] knocked and heaven&#39;s door was open at
[2748.559s] the prle gates S&amp;P midcap same story S&amp;T
[2752.92s] small caps coming off the mat with that
[2755.319s] fake out with the carry trade
[2757.559s] uh quote unquote unwind I think this is
[2759.599s] going to be the story for the next three
[2761.16s] weeks breaking back above here I don&#39;t
[2763.119s] know if we get I doubt we get to 2500 in
[2765.28s] the next few weeks but maybe we do and
[2767.559s] then during October November we come
[2769.359s] back and test this or come back and test
[2771.2s] this before a long-term
[2773.839s] upside um on to the next small cap index
[2777.359s] we covered that that&#39;s uh Toronto uh
[2780.559s] that here&#39;s Tokyo I don&#39;t see this one
[2783.64s] going to new highs this one I think it&#39;s
[2785.4s] going to fail uh if you have been
[2789.2s] listening and the Hang saying I love
[2790.96s] this guess what broke out the trend line
[2793.16s] retested now breaking back up and I
[2795.839s] think the game is just beginning uh
[2797.88s] we&#39;ll cover Alibaba got the Dual listing
[2800.359s] approved in the general meeting on the
[2802.359s] 22nd which means uh that it it can be
[2806.559s] included in the southbound stock connect
[2809.28s] on September 9th which will enable 180
[2812.359s] million new buyers to buy Alibaba for
[2814.599s] the first time from mainland China what
[2817.079s] we&#39;re seeing in terms of flows is people
[2818.839s] are raising some cash from Pino Duo and
[2821.96s] 10 cent uh so my guess is some of this
[2825.48s] money is allocated to be able to
[2827.28s] purchase Alibaba for the first time and
[2829.76s] we&#39;ll be excited to welcome those fellow
[2832.88s] co-owners for the longterm very soon and
[2836.92s] that could be if you listened to last
[2838.599s] week with Brendan somewhere between 20
[2841.559s] to4 billion dollar of buying power over
[2844.92s] time so we&#39;re very very excited about
[2847.119s] that and you can see that this trend
[2849.16s] line downtrend broke and now we did the
[2852.0s] retest and now we&#39;re going back to the
[2854.04s] promised land uh bullish sentiment we&#39;ve
[2857.2s] covered that a million times uh 10year
[2859.8s] yield rolling over everything we need to
[2861.8s] say probably see a counter Trend move
[2864.0s] here I would imagine 10-year yield uh
[2867.52s] same
[2868.44s] thing dollar same thing all the things
[2871.24s] are in place Japanese Yen probably get a
[2874.319s] counter Trend move but uh that is going
[2877.44s] to strengthen over time Canadian dollar
[2879.359s] the Looney is getting strong ladies and
[2881.48s] gentlemen that is good news not bad news
[2884.4s] dollar getting weak for all of our
[2886.079s] Canadian viewers they are smiling so
[2888.16s] wide they could eat a banana sideways uh
[2891.28s] gold I think this is going to prove to
[2892.96s] be a fake out over time uh copper
[2896.359s] Futures this is turning back up with
[2898.28s] China turning back up that&#39;s gonna that
[2900.359s] that move is probably just getting
[2902.28s] started
[2904.52s] um and I think that&#39;s all we need to
[2907.599s] cover from
[2909.4s] this by the way SMH I don&#39;t know if I
[2913.119s] have that article yeah I do I do um it
[2915.839s] was funny Nvidia every time Nvidia goes
[2918.52s] down Intel goes up and we&#39;re going to
[2920.119s] talk about why and that&#39;s pretty
[2921.72s] exciting as
[2923.079s] well um I could see a scenario where the
[2925.92s] SMH goes down and Intel goes up a lot
[2928.28s] but uh we&#39;ll talk about that in future
[2930.48s] episodes because I want to get you out
[2931.799s] of here and get you to wherever you&#39;re
[2933.079s] going in my case it&#39;s called the golf
[2935.119s] course in many of your cases I&#39;m sure
[2936.839s] it&#39;s called the beach and
[2944.24s] uh I think that&#39;s all we need to cover
[2946.96s] CCI look at this
[2949.119s] beautiful breakout back test moving
[2952.16s] higher it&#39;s going to keep moving higher
[2953.64s] this thing is just getting started we&#39;re
[2955.079s] so excited about this one uh you guys
[2957.559s] hung in there while we build that base
[2959.2s] and now we&#39;re back off to the promis
[2961.16s] land and let&#39;s see what else did he
[2963.96s] cover here he covered a lot of stocks
[2966.319s] this guy&#39;s busier than a one-arm paper
[2968.04s] hanger all right moving along let&#39;s see
[2970.68s] what else we got here Nvidia market cap
[2974.119s] of course it can grow at 40% it&#39;ll be
[2976.119s] 100% of GDP in eight years that makes a
[2978.48s] lot of sense but the sell side thinks
[2980.0s] that makes sense and that&#39;s why they&#39;re
[2981.48s] the they&#39;re holding the bag today
[2984.559s] um all right retail investor purchases
[2988.359s] of Nvidia before
[2990.559s] earnings of course after it hits2 and
[2993.119s] a53 trillion dollar everyone wants it
[2995.48s] when it&#39;s at500 billion and a trillion
[2998.0s] no one wants it it&#39;s just the way it
[2999.76s] goes and they couldn&#39;t get enough Nvidia
[3002.799s] so they had to buy a triple levered
[3004.359s] Nvidia levered right into earnings and
[3006.28s] get smoke absolute smoke show as Jensen
[3009.64s] Wong is selling more of his stock to you
[3012.88s] uh oh and by the way in order to absorb
[3014.799s] all the stock that he&#39;s selling to you
[3016.319s] he was so kind to authorize another $50
[3019.28s] billion of buyback in order to create a
[3022.44s] market for him to sell stock on the
[3024.68s] market at 29 times sales that makes a
[3027.559s] lot of sense where was the $50 billion
[3029.72s] when it was at you know a hundred
[3031.96s] billion valuation nowhere to be found
[3034.28s] where&#39;s the $50 billion now it&#39;s AT3
[3036.319s] trillion
[3038.48s] valuation all
[3042.24s] right uh cumulative S&amp;P 500 performance
[3045.559s] for September starting in
[3047.319s] 1954 so this is exactly in line with
[3049.839s] what we&#39;ve been saying further strength
[3051.76s] possible new highs into mid-mon right
[3053.48s] before the buy the rumor sell the news
[3055.0s] of the cut and then some weakness into
[3057.079s] month end uh same thing with the dollar
[3060.24s] this counter Trend move that that we may
[3062.24s] get here and then weakness into
[3064.2s] September October uh expected F fed
[3067.359s] funds expected rate change uh 200 basis
[3071.0s] points now uh at the beginning uh last
[3074.24s] September it was only 33 basis points
[3077.0s] it&#39;s amazing opinion follows Trend
[3078.72s] ladies and gentlemen initial joob claims
[3081.64s] this is what the fed&#39;s worried about
[3083.2s] this is why the fed&#39;s taking action we
[3085.96s] talked about the performance after the
[3087.48s] first
[3088.88s] cut I was supposed to talk about PayPal
[3092.799s] and Disney today on Clayman but we ran
[3095.04s] out of time
[3097.2s] um and by the way I was on with Scott
[3099.4s] Bower who&#39;s a really good guy and I like
[3101.28s] him a lot I didn&#39;t know that he was
[3102.839s] going to be bullish Nvidia and I was
[3105.68s] going to be bearish so Scott if you&#39;re
[3107.799s] listening no offense it&#39;s just my view
[3111.0s] on the stock I may be wrong and you may
[3112.88s] be right but uh always love going on
[3115.799s] with you and uh didn&#39;t expect to be uh
[3119.76s] taking the other side of you on that on
[3122.079s] that one but uh all right Disney M puts
[3125.24s] Morgan Stanley James Gorman in charge of
[3127.68s] finding Bob iger&#39;s successor this I
[3130.96s] believe is the next Catalyst for Disney
[3133.04s] stock besides all the things that we&#39;ve
[3134.96s] talked about in terms of the pricing in
[3136.52s] terms of value Act and the other thing
[3138.359s] that&#39;s very interesting besides the fact
[3140.48s] that value act an activist investor in
[3143.079s] Disney besides the fact that they
[3147.04s] uh turned around Salesforce turned
[3149.68s] around New York Times and turned around
[3152.2s] Spotify through changing their pricing
[3156.0s] uh uh packages and everything else and
[3158.96s] completely multiplied the stock when
[3160.92s] they were involved in an activist and
[3162.559s] they&#39;re doing that with Disney one of
[3165.04s] their biggest successes was actually
[3167.92s] playing a role in getting the new CEO
[3171.799s] for Microsoft his name was SAA nadela
[3176.0s] and
[3177.28s] SAA was a catalyst for a huge
[3179.359s] multibagger over many years I believe
[3182.079s] the next Catalyst for Disney and I also
[3184.68s] believe uh value Act is going to play a
[3186.92s] significant role in addition to James
[3188.88s] Gorman and may have actually chosen G
[3190.76s] James Gorman for the job of picking the
[3193.4s] CEO the next Catalyst will be the
[3196.319s] announcement of who will succeed Bob
[3199.319s] Iger and I can assure you with Val value
[3202.079s] act involved and James Gorman involved
[3204.52s] it&#39;s going to be a big name a name like
[3208.559s] uh uh this the Chipotle guy going over
[3213.0s] to
[3214.72s] Starbuck that type of impact I don&#39;t
[3217.2s] know who it&#39;s going to be but it&#39;s going
[3218.799s] to be a major major player that everyone
[3221.92s] loves a high-end operator that can
[3225.079s] absolutely rock it and I think that&#39;s
[3226.88s] the next Catalyst for Disney because
[3229.079s] they&#39;ve already put all the mechanisms
[3230.52s] in place in terms of the highest return
[3232.799s] on uh invested Capital uh allocations to
[3236.839s] the parks and to the cruises and then
[3240.16s] raising the prices for Disney plus and
[3242.72s] blockbuster movies they&#39;re they&#39;re
[3244.52s] hitting on all cylinders I have a couple
[3246.799s] weak quarters because the the lowend
[3248.96s] customer is a little bit uh weak but
[3251.64s] that will come back and uh and they&#39;ll
[3254.119s] have a new CEO that everyone&#39;s going to
[3255.76s] be excited about and I can&#39;t wait to see
[3257.799s] who it&#39;s going to
[3259.72s] be Intel hiring Morgan Stanley and other
[3263.04s] advisers for activist events I gotta say
[3266.44s] it would not Shock me to wake up one
[3268.76s] morning and see Elliott has taken a 10
[3271.48s] not a
[3272.839s] 10 a couple billion dollar position two
[3276.0s] to five billion dollars in Intel trading
[3278.48s] at tangible Book value and shake the
[3281.319s] tree like nobody&#39;s business and if that
[3284.119s] happens this is going to be a $40 stock
[3286.68s] much faster than we expect and uh then
[3290.16s] have the runway to of ultimately be an80
[3293.48s] and $100 stock if they get The Foundry
[3296.16s] uh deal correct and speaking of getting
[3298.559s] The Foundry deal correct uh today there
[3301.559s] was an announcement and this is what
[3303.72s] we&#39;ve all been waiting for it well first
[3305.48s] off the we saw from Best Buys shoot the
[3308.92s] lights out earnings is that they can&#39;t
[3311.28s] believe the demand for aip&#39;s and who is
[3314.0s] the leader in aip&#39;s that is going to
[3316.04s] ship 40 million this year is Intel and
[3320.359s] what else happened with Intel today IBM
[3323.839s] Cloud to offer Intel&#39;s gouty 3 AI chips
[3328.079s] next year what does that mean it&#39;s half
[3330.68s] the price from of the Nvidia h100 it&#39;s
[3334.559s] twice as fast and it&#39;s 40% more energy
[3338.24s] efficient so if you think that investors
[3341.92s] are going to stand by and allow the
[3344.68s] hyperscalers to spend unlimited amounts
[3346.72s] of money on Nvidia
[3349.039s] chips uh with no clear return on
[3353.359s] investment and if you go back to the the
[3358.28s] seoa article the $600 billion question
[3361.92s] given the amount that mag 7 have spent
[3364.44s] on Nvidia chips it would require $600
[3367.48s] billion of new Revenue that&#39;s not there
[3369.24s] to justify to spend so they&#39;re going to
[3371.359s] want to keep investing in AI but they&#39;re
[3373.119s] going to want to do so in a way where
[3375.16s] they can get closer to a return on
[3376.64s] investment sooner otherwise shareholders
[3379.319s] are going to force them to stop just as
[3381.68s] I mentioned on Cavuto if you remember
[3384.039s] when Mark Zuckerberg was spending uh I
[3386.4s] think 1010 billion on the metaverse and
[3389.24s] all of a sudden shareholders said
[3390.48s] there&#39;s no return on this and they sold
[3392.0s] the stock down from like 300 down to
[3394.559s] $80 uh all of a sudden he said oh did I
[3397.4s] say I was going to spend a lot on a
[3398.48s] metaverse I must I was mistaken now the
[3401.44s] Stock&#39;s at $80 uh I decided not to do
[3404.24s] that anymore because there&#39;s no clear
[3405.92s] return on investment uh and all of a
[3408.2s] sudden the stock rebounded from 80 up to
[3410.079s] 4 500 wherever it is right now I think
[3412.4s] you&#39;re going to see the same thing with
[3414.039s] hyperscalers Google
[3416.72s] uh Amazon Etc that
[3419.76s] will either have to justify the return
[3423.2s] on investment or find new ways of doing
[3426.24s] more with less and Intel is the way to
[3428.079s] do that to get more for less money and
[3430.48s] IBM is ahead of the curve on this with
[3433.039s] the gouty gouty 3 twice as fast half the
[3435.88s] money uh etc etc etc so what is that
[3438.839s] going to do it&#39;s going to impair
[3440.68s] nvidia&#39;s margins and I think this is
[3443.0s] very much like the gp1 Eli L came out
[3447.24s] this week and said oh by the way we&#39;re
[3449.16s] not going to charge you $1,000 for Zep
[3451.64s] bound we&#39;re going to charge you
[3453.52s] $399 for zound why because this little
[3456.72s] company called hims and hers was selling
[3459.0s] one at $200 a month that you know they
[3462.96s] paid a PR machine to go out and say
[3464.839s] that&#39;s dangerous it doesn&#39;t work except
[3466.599s] everyone was buying it and probably
[3468.4s] there were people getting results and
[3470.76s] all of a sudden they said well just out
[3472.16s] of the kindness of our heart we&#39;re going
[3473.839s] to drop our prices by 60% because we&#39;re
[3476.72s] such a great beautiful company and uh
[3479.96s] and all of a sudden we realize what we
[3481.96s] knew from the beginning that glps are a
[3484.4s] commodity and you can get them anywhere
[3485.76s] and it&#39;s a race for the bottom with
[3487.079s] price uh and they can be life-changing
[3489.4s] that the JW is still out on that but so
[3491.88s] far so good it looks great we&#39;ll see uh
[3495.319s] over the long term uh but what we do
[3498.359s] know is it&#39;s no longer the Holy Grail
[3500.88s] because it can be replicated and the
[3503.48s] same is going to be through the case
[3506.559s] with Intel and the uh GPU chips that
[3511.64s] everyone thinks only Nvidia can make
[3513.48s] except for the fact that others are
[3515.599s] going to catch them or make something at
[3517.48s] least close enough good at such a lower
[3519.64s] price
[3521.64s] that
[3523.24s] buyers pressured by their shareholders
[3525.799s] are either going to have to stop their
[3527.319s] spend which makes them less potentially
[3529.68s] less competitive or modify their spend
[3532.76s] so they can keep pedal in the metal for
[3535.039s] AI and AI training and data centers and
[3538.039s] all of that but do it at a more
[3539.68s] reasonable cost Which Intel has always
[3541.48s] been a commodity producer and uh will
[3544.16s] have the Machinery that none of them
[3545.76s] have with foundaries and be able to
[3547.72s] produce it&#39;s going to be awesome so
[3551.44s] um uh I&#39;ll let you know how I really
[3553.64s] feel about it in just a minute I&#39;m
[3555.96s] kidding all right uh what else do we
[3558.72s] have here the big number 88,000
[3561.599s] revisions tomorrow&#39;s newspaper today
[3563.319s] we&#39;ve been talking about that for a year
[3565.24s] we say they&#39;ve
[3567.119s] already misreported 500,000 more jobs it
[3570.76s] turned out to be 88,000 more jobs uh
[3574.359s] hedge funds are consciously uncoupling
[3576.039s] from the mag s so they&#39;re seeing the
[3577.64s] writing on the wall you saw duck and
[3579.2s] Miller selling out many others feds
[3582.079s] Powell declares the time has come for
[3583.52s] rate Cuts uh we all know that&#39;s coming
[3586.319s] why Disney plus has succeeded while
[3587.92s] Netflix Rivals struggle and we know the
[3590.64s] answer to that is because they&#39;ve got
[3591.839s] the best content Li library in the world
[3594.039s] and I was also slated to speak about
[3595.799s] Disney didn&#39;t get time but the key thing
[3598.119s] there is that the parks and the
[3602.359s] experiences and the cruises and the
[3604.28s] consumer products are valued at about
[3606.16s] $80 a share the stocks trading at 90
[3608.76s] which implies the 153 million
[3611.52s] subscribers that by the way their prices
[3613.64s] went up dramatically uh are worth zero
[3616.52s] and the billion dollar Blockbusters
[3618.359s] called Deadpool and Wolverine and Inside
[3621.2s] Out 2 are worth nothing and ESPN is
[3624.599s] worth nothing and we&#39;re taking a a
[3627.079s] wildly crazy position that they&#39;re
[3628.839s] actually worth something and uh you
[3631.319s] could say well they have half the
[3632.599s] subscribers of Netflix okay well Netflix
[3634.839s] is worth $300 billion so could we be
[3637.52s] worth 50 billion could be we be worth a
[3640.2s] 100 billion oh and by the way have a
[3642.039s] double in the stock in the meantime the
[3643.92s] answer is yes and um there you go fomo
[3648.119s] returns to the options Market says
[3649.76s] Traders Chase stocks higher maybe we&#39;ll
[3652.0s] get some gamma squeeze into the first
[3654.039s] half of September and we&#39;ll continue to
[3656.68s] harvest profits like we did earlier in
[3659.72s] the summer for our two mag s Holdings
[3663.24s] which we sold off um meaningfully um and
[3668.16s] our banks which we also had big runs we
[3670.799s] sold off and uh we&#39;ll get a chance to
[3673.359s] reload some of those potentially in late
[3675.48s] October before the election when
[3677.0s] everyone&#39;s panicked as if it&#39;s going to
[3679.079s] matter at the end of the day gridlock is
[3681.319s] the name of the game and for the markets
[3684.16s] for the markets for other things there
[3686.2s] there are things that are very important
[3687.4s] to people and I get it and um I&#39;m you
[3691.28s] know that&#39;s not what we do at hedge fund
[3695.119s] tips with Tom Hayes we talk about
[3697.92s] business the starter home is making a
[3699.88s] comeback as the housing market thoughts
[3701.559s] for firsttime buyers we talked about
[3703.559s] that Teemu parent PDD stocks suffering a
[3706.359s] record plunge after record after Revenue
[3709.48s] misses forecast we&#39;ve been saying for
[3712.16s] months either unsustainable or
[3714.76s] unreliable so far it&#39;s only turned out
[3717.319s] to be the former unsustainable you can&#39;t
[3719.96s] keep selling crap at a loss uh and and
[3724.24s] expect it to work and uh and we may find
[3728.0s] also based on the Ft article down the
[3730.799s] road that it was also the numbers were
[3733.119s] also unreliable uh we have no position
[3735.799s] long or short uh we just know that the
[3739.119s] competition they&#39;re referring to is
[3741.64s] Alibaba got off their ass and said no
[3744.48s] Moss we&#39;re bigger we&#39;re better we&#39;re
[3746.52s] smarter we&#39;re coming at you and they did
[3749.2s] and they stopped the bleeding they are
[3751.279s] regaining share and uh teu is going to
[3754.92s] be uh a competitor but they&#39;re not in
[3757.64s] the same league and as the Chinese
[3759.559s] economy recovers and people actually buy
[3762.039s] normal stuff versus cheap stuff that
[3764.559s] goes in the garbage bin after a week uh
[3767.44s] Alibaba is going to reign supreme tool
[3770.359s] up for lower rates with Stanley Black
[3772.2s] and&amp; Decker this is a huge article from
[3774.44s] The Wall Street Journal this thing I
[3776.599s] mean we&#39;ve had a big move in it but it&#39;s
[3778.279s] just getting started and um and we&#39;re
[3781.24s] excited to see all these thesis
[3782.799s] continually play out one by one fed cut
[3785.76s] could lift Chinese stocks here who could
[3787.839s] benefit we know who could benefit this
[3790.44s] I&#39;ll continue to remind my wealthy
[3792.2s] investor friends who are listening there
[3794.2s] are opportunities in beating down Office
[3796.839s] Buildings and in this off and in this
[3800.44s] article uh and Barons they&#39;re talking
[3803.119s] about certain REITs and so on but you
[3804.96s] you all know what I&#39;m talking about and
[3806.2s] you&#39;re probably ahead of the pack on
[3807.72s] that the key is just holding period and
[3809.839s] burn until it turns and what&#39;s going to
[3812.24s] cause it to turn is a higher R
[3813.76s] employment rate where people get scared
[3816.24s] and they want FaceTime they go back to
[3817.799s] the office but more important than that
[3819.88s] every boss knows they get twice the
[3821.76s] productivity from people when they come
[3823.4s] to the office and the collaboration and
[3825.92s] the magic that comes from 1 plus one is
[3828.599s] three but they don&#39;t have any leverage
[3830.72s] to force people back to the office when
[3832.839s] the labor market is not is still tight
[3835.88s] that is changing once it does they&#39;ll
[3837.799s] just say you don&#39;t want to come to the
[3839.119s] office you know mail in your your
[3842.039s] security pass and let&#39;s call it a day
[3844.48s] and that&#39;s going to be happening more
[3845.72s] and more and more and that&#39;s where
[3847.279s] Office Buildings are going to fly met uh
[3849.96s] a person uh when I was out to dinner the
[3851.96s] other night and
[3854.52s] um she was saying she&#39;s doing leases at
[3857.0s] like 140 a foot in New York for a
[3859.079s] properties B andc are still spotty but
[3861.16s] like it&#39;s it&#39;s hotter than ever so uh
[3864.4s] there you go
[3866.64s] and Boeing says a travel boom in China
[3868.44s] will double demand for planes Yeah so
[3870.68s] basically Boeing was saying yeah you
[3871.92s] know how we said we had 10 years of
[3873.559s] backlog with 6600 plan planes yeah we
[3876.24s] messed that up too it&#39;s actually another
[3877.68s] 8,000 planes that we don&#39;t think we&#39;re
[3880.119s] going to be able to provide because we
[3882.119s] don&#39;t have enough capacity we in other
[3883.76s] words we have more people throwing money
[3885.64s] at us than we&#39;ll ever be able to
[3886.96s] possibly handle and you can&#39;t give the
[3888.48s] stock away and those are the things we
[3890.2s] like the common sense things the cigar
[3892.079s] butts that are sitting down there and
[3894.2s] before long it&#39;s a double in everyone
[3896.079s] says oh how can I get call opt daily and
[3899.799s] weekly call options at on Boeing when
[3902.48s] it&#39;s at $400 and it&#39;ll be sold to them
[3906.16s] the dumb money poured into Nvidia ahead
[3908.119s] of its results it could have been worse
[3910.279s] so that&#39;s from Steve Goldstein over at
[3913.119s] market watch Canada Goose known for
[3915.44s] heavyweight parkas leans into t-shirts
[3917.68s] and shorts
[3920.2s] um we&#39;ll see we&#39;ll see we&#39;re going to
[3922.96s] cover this one maybe in detail next week
[3925.52s] um obviously their APAC is shooting the
[3927.44s] lights out I think that&#39;s going to
[3928.96s] continue to even grow further uh China
[3931.72s] vows to Quick Quicken buying unsold
[3934.24s] homes for public housing so again
[3936.799s] they&#39;re they continue to make these
[3938.079s] incremental moves so that&#39;s good Nvidia
[3940.799s] tumbles after disappointing forecast
[3942.72s] Blackwell chip snags the gouty 3 is
[3945.2s] working just fine here was an analyst
[3947.24s] saying
[3948.44s] that
[3953.92s] uh Neen said Rivals such as Intel could
[3958.76s] quote unquote chip away at nvidia&#39;s
[3961.44s] market share if they developed a better
[3964.119s] product which they have with gouty 3
[3966.039s] certainly over the h100 not quite at
[3968.4s] Blackwell levels yet but you know
[3970.799s] Blackwell&#39;s delayed that&#39;s going to give
[3972.16s] in uh Intel some time but twice the
[3975.64s] speed half the price 40% more energy
[3977.559s] efficient energy is a huge input cost
[3979.279s] for the whole uh training game for AI so
[3982.839s] that&#39;s that but IBM going with Intel
[3985.2s] here is a big deal ladies and gentlemen
[3987.76s] because if you
[3989.799s] remember IBM is the OG of Intel you
[3993.24s] remember wat of um AI if you remember
[3996.72s] Watson and Jeopardy and all that stuff
[3999.599s] so uh so they know know a thing or two
[4001.599s] about training models Alibaba 10-cent
[4004.079s] cast wide net for AI upstarts since 2023
[4007.599s] 40% of alibaba&#39;s deals in China and 30%
[4010.44s] 10 cents of targeted AI startups I think
[4013.44s] we&#39;re going to find out some where 12 24
[4017.0s] 36 months down the road that a lot of
[4020.4s] our gains were attributable to something
[4022.079s] that we didn&#39;t even know that we didn&#39;t
[4023.4s] even know something they owned wound up
[4025.119s] being a thousand bagger and we had 10%
[4027.359s] of the company through our ownership in
[4029.559s] Alibaba because they give them cloud
[4031.64s] computing credits in exchange for equity
[4034.279s] which is a brilliant deal uh Alibaba
[4037.119s] shareholders approved dual primary
[4038.799s] listing Paving the way for September
[4040.4s] southbound inclusion we talked about
[4042.24s] that that&#39;s a big deal pind Duo suffers
[4045.24s] a 55 billion market cap wipe out after
[4049.0s] flagging uncertain market and The Comedy
[4051.319s] of this is that Intel you know pindu do
[4054.96s] I think sold off 30 something percent
[4057.319s] and intel was uh not Intel Baba was down
[4060.079s] like 4% on that day thinking oh the
[4062.839s] Chinese consumer is weak that&#39;s not the
[4065.24s] reason timu was down the reason timu was
[4067.279s] down is because Alibaba said no MOS and
[4070.4s] took the share back started taking share
[4072.319s] back and they can&#39;t compete with them
[4074.24s] because they&#39;re bigger they&#39;re stronger
[4075.799s] they&#39;re meaner and now that they&#39;re
[4077.079s] focused they&#39;re going to destroy them so
[4079.799s] um other than that how was the play Mrs
[4082.279s] Lincoln so let&#39;s get down to our article
[4084.359s] of the week oil cans and vans stock
[4087.079s] market and sentiment results let&#39;s see
[4089.039s] where we are on time we got to get you
[4090.52s] guys to the beach uh we covered all that
[4094.52s] all right I will go through the key
[4096.08s] points for the Advanced Auto Parts
[4098.159s] update so key points for the continued
[4101.279s] turnaround number one solvency risk is
[4103.159s] off the table they they sold the one
[4105.199s] point .5 billion World pack business
[4108.159s] they&#39;ll get 1.2 billion net and they
[4110.96s] will use that to bring down the debt
[4113.799s] ratio to 2.5 times and reignite growth
[4117.359s] by opening a 100 stores per year they&#39;ve
[4120.359s] got a new real estate team so this is
[4122.279s] not just a stay alive story this is a
[4125.52s] growth story a stay alive story makes it
[4127.759s] a double over the next three to five
[4129.6s] years which they just guaranteed with
[4131.52s] that sale and paying down the debt a
[4134.279s] growth story of opening another hundred
[4136.4s] stores a year and shutting the ones that
[4138.199s] are cash flow negative which is a
[4139.719s] creative to free cash flow is the story
[4142.12s] that story that we want to hear which is
[4144.279s] what this guy is doing who ran Shane
[4147.159s] Kelly Shane o Kelly who ran HD Supply S7
[4150.48s] billion do business for Home Depot he
[4152.56s] knows how to run this type of business
[4154.64s] and he&#39;s taken the steps to move it and
[4156.799s] it&#39;s going to happen over time yes the
[4159.759s] 75,000 and under is weak yes it&#39;s weak
[4163.52s] but they were still able to increased
[4165.799s] com store sales by 4% EUR over-year
[4168.52s] despite the Challenge lowend Customer
[4171.719s] also they had a ton of
[4173.88s] stuff uh that was just mispriced
[4176.52s] relative to the competition now they&#39;re
[4178.319s] not racing to the bottom but what they
[4179.799s] are doing is matching their competitors
[4183.08s] at the prices that there where they are
[4185.199s] so they&#39;ve got an equal shot to get the
[4187.199s] business and he tells a story about a
[4189.159s] radiator that was like $50 more than any
[4191.88s] of his competitors and he was wondering
[4193.319s] why they weren&#39;t selling radiators well
[4195.04s] du you got to be in line with the market
[4197.44s] and they&#39;ve done that now across the
[4199.159s] board so they&#39;re getting products to
[4201.0s] people quick and the most important
[4202.719s] thing that they&#39;re doing that their
[4203.8s] competitors have been less good at doing
[4206.08s] is paying up for their Frontline people
[4208.679s] in order to have people that can talk to
[4211.12s] the professionals remember it&#39;s a
[4212.52s] blended box half of it&#39;s from the
[4214.719s] do-it-yourselfers walking in to buy a
[4216.44s] battery and putting it in the parking
[4217.84s] lot and the other half is the
[4219.84s] professionals down the street with their
[4221.239s] garage need a part right away because
[4223.6s] they got to get the the car off the lift
[4225.44s] or they lose money by tying up the bay
[4228.4s] so Advance needs to get know what the
[4230.6s] parts are get on the parts quickly add a
[4233.0s] reasonable competitive price and that&#39;s
[4235.44s] what they&#39;re now doing and they&#39;re the
[4237.12s] only ones that have these specialized
[4239.8s] Frontline people who actually have
[4241.76s] experience in the business versus hiring
[4244.239s] someone who worked at Carl Jr the week
[4247.0s] before who knows about lettuce rfts but
[4249.28s] doesn&#39;t know anything about you know
[4251.64s] alternators and uh sounds like an idiot
[4253.92s] when the professionals call so I think
[4256.04s] over time they&#39;re going to build that
[4258.56s] Goodwill with the professionals and be
[4260.6s] the go-to place in selected regions that
[4263.0s] they dominate uh the other thing that
[4264.84s] they&#39;re trying to do is they&#39;re going to
[4266.32s] shut down areas uh that they&#39;re not the
[4268.88s] leader and they&#39;re going to reinvest
[4271.08s] around areas where they are uh so they
[4274.08s] can keep keep the growth and keep every
[4276.239s] store uh growing free cash flow which is
[4279.08s] the name of the game this guy knows his
[4281.4s] stuff the Distribution Center
[4282.92s] consolidation down to 14 from 38 and
[4285.44s] they&#39;ll have these nodes and hubs all
[4287.159s] over the country that&#39;s going to lead to
[4289.159s] at least 50 million of procurement
[4290.76s] savings next year and then finally he
[4293.28s] talk to uh a achieving 100 million of
[4296.88s] free cash flow this year this is what we
[4298.36s] talk about every single uh company all
[4301.44s] we need to know is that solvency risk is
[4304.28s] off the table and they&#39;ve got some level
[4307.56s] of they&#39;re getting to cash flow positive
[4309.92s] or even generating free cash flow and
[4312.4s] then if it&#39;s priced in for death and it
[4314.6s] doesn&#39;t die that&#39;s when you get doubles
[4316.36s] and triples and that&#39;s that&#39;s going to
[4317.88s] be the case here just as it was with
[4320.08s] Cooper standard and then once they get
[4321.76s] going they take on a life of their own
[4323.48s] and that&#39;s when you get
[4324.679s] multi-baggers and um by the way while
[4327.6s] we&#39;re on to it uh go to hedgefund
[4329.88s] tips.com click on terms this is all
[4333.159s] opinion not advice speak to your
[4335.6s] financial advisor etc etc etc we deal
[4339.199s] exclusively with accredited investors
[4340.8s] qualified clients family offices Etc and
[4345.52s] uh so you can go
[4347.199s] through these 30 pages of stuff that I
[4350.04s] outlined oneon-one
[4352.48s] um this is how you become a good
[4354.76s] investor so most of you are going to
[4356.52s] blow through this and just take those
[4358.199s] eight points and run with it and that&#39;s
[4359.719s] perfectly fine but those of you who are
[4362.04s] serious about honing your craft when you
[4364.52s] read thousands of these over a career
[4367.0s] and you pay attention to every single
[4368.8s] word you start to large language model
[4372.679s] develop inputs where 3 years down the
[4375.56s] road you&#39;re going to see a different
[4376.52s] company and and a certain series of
[4379.159s] actions and you&#39;re going to say I&#39;m
[4380.6s] going to make a fortune on this because
[4383.08s] this is what I saw happen in the past
[4384.719s] and this is what happens when this aals
[4387.12s] bals C equals D but you can only do that
[4389.6s] from doing the work consistently over a
[4391.36s] long period of time there&#39;s no quick fix
[4393.679s] uh and if you get a a quick double or
[4396.76s] triple and you haven&#39;t done any of the
[4398.159s] work you&#39;ll give it back to the casino
[4400.08s] because you don&#39;t know how you got there
[4402.52s] um
[4406.0s] all right so you can see we did a ton of
[4408.88s] work on this but let&#39;s go on to VF Corp
[4411.56s] so we did oil cans now let&#39;s do vans the
[4413.76s] key key points for a continued
[4415.28s] turnaround free cash flow plus proceeds
[4418.08s] from non-core physical asset sales is
[4420.52s] $600 million for this year that&#39;s
[4424.199s] excluding the $1.5 billion Supreme sale
[4428.199s] they brought their debt down 587 million
[4430.719s] so far this year uh Northface had a
[4433.8s] direct to Consumer UPS 6% their us
[4436.52s] wholesale was the weak point uh they got
[4440.28s] 1.5 billion so again these are key
[4442.679s] things we&#39;ve been saying we going to
[4444.199s] come are now happening with Advanced
[4447.48s] Auto Parts getting rid of wh pack
[4449.32s] deleveraging the balance sheet getting
[4450.96s] back to growth hundred stores a year VF
[4453.679s] Corp taking solvency risk off the table
[4455.84s] selling the Supreme getting a decent
[4458.639s] price paying down debt putting some into
[4462.0s] the business for growth on track for
[4463.96s] $300 million The Cost Cuts on top of it
[4466.92s] Vans quote while the headline numbers
[4469.48s] remain weak several indicators are
[4471.08s] showing we&#39;re headed in the right
[4472.28s] direction EMA is once again the region
[4475.56s] which is showing clear early encouraging
[4478.8s] signs with wholesale up in the quarter
[4481.36s] for the first time in six quarters with
[4483.96s] particularly positive momentum in key
[4486.92s] accounts and he said last quarter that
[4489.32s] EU was kind of the canary in the coal
[4491.88s] mine when that starts to turn it&#39;s the
[4493.639s] beginning of the entire world turning
[4495.6s] and he reemphasized that on this
[4497.08s] quarter&#39;s call Vans quote our new
[4500.0s] products which are performing well
[4501.28s] across regions the new school continued
[4503.719s] to gain momentum and is performing well
[4505.719s] across regions and is now the number two
[4507.88s] franchise globally it&#39;s exactly what the
[4509.96s] guy in the store the skater dude who
[4512.4s] puts the skateboards together was
[4513.84s] telling me I spent an hour and a half
[4515.4s] talking to him about every single shoe
[4517.32s] and traffic and where people are coming
[4519.679s] from and what are the age of people and
[4521.84s] what are they excited about and why do
[4523.56s] they buy and all the other things that
[4525.56s] you would do in a channel check next new
[4528.639s] products and marketing efforts are
[4530.4s] resonating with consumers and
[4531.84s] contributing to further progress in
[4534.08s] Google search Trends which continue to
[4536.28s] move in the right direction across our
[4538.56s] markets nine Northface quote ac across
[4542.12s] both channels and regionally the
[4544.159s] standout continues to be APAC which grew
[4546.76s] strongly up
[4548.48s] 35% even as we com comped the postco
[4552.48s] opening quarter last year that&#39;s China
[4556.239s] ladies and gentlemen where the consumer
[4557.84s] is quote unquote dead but has more cash
[4560.08s] than ever they will thaw they will get
[4562.719s] excited again when all their friends
[4564.719s] start to have new clothes they will too
[4567.159s] quote at Vans we still see modest
[4569.92s] sequential Improvement as we did this
[4572.56s] quarter moving forward so each quarter
[4575.92s] look it&#39;s not exciting to be down so
[4577.96s] much and say wow we&#39;re doing great we&#39;re
[4580.04s] down less this quarter than we were last
[4581.92s] quarter it&#39;s like take them around back
[4583.48s] and shoot them already but it&#39;s it&#39;s a
[4586.56s] turnaround process we knew exactly what
[4590.28s] the plan was and as you know despondent
[4593.32s] as some of the numbers look when they&#39;re
[4595.28s] saying them that was all part of the
[4597.239s] plan so don&#39;t shoot him just yet he&#39;s
[4600.12s] doing a great job the uh the new
[4602.88s] platform in the Americas approved from
[4604.96s] adopted from Europe This was another key
[4606.639s] part of the plan is moving strongly in
[4608.719s] the right direction and at Vans we&#39;re
[4610.8s] seeing prog the progress we&#39;re expected
[4613.639s] next Vans the new franchises are doing
[4617.0s] well and we&#39;ve got two of our new
[4619.28s] franchises that are now in the top five
[4621.76s] so Ultra range and new school One&#39;s
[4624.6s] number two and one&#39;s number five Vans
[4627.96s] quote our Grassroots campaign is well
[4630.04s] underway as is our influencer campaign
[4632.6s] you may have seen a few celebrities
[4634.04s] caught wearing Vans just recently if you
[4636.28s] Google it you&#39;ll see it we covered it
[4637.76s] last week I think it was Jennifer
[4639.4s] Lawrence and two other young it girls
[4642.6s] that I have no idea who they are I&#39;ll
[4644.56s] ask my daughters vfc quote some Emily
[4647.52s] Rakowski was one I know who she is and
[4649.76s] then
[4650.96s] um I forget the other one uh quote
[4654.04s] something that some of you may not have
[4656.679s] realized we are moving super fast here
[4659.32s] and a lot of what we&#39;re doing for
[4661.4s] example right now I can&#39;t tell you what
[4663.76s] we&#39;re doing but we&#39;re doing a lot right
[4665.84s] now that we&#39;re not disclosing for
[4668.08s] example at this point last quarter we
[4670.36s] didn&#39;t tell you about Sun that&#39;s the
[4672.8s] lady that&#39;s going to run vans that came
[4674.679s] from from Lulu you didn&#39;t know about
[4676.6s] Carolyn who&#39;s running North Face uh you
[4680.56s] didn&#39;t know about Supreme which they got
[4682.48s] one and a half billion dollars and I&#39;m
[4684.639s] I&#39;m not suggesting we&#39;ve got people
[4685.92s] changes or portfolio changing my point
[4688.0s] is we just got big activities that are
[4692.08s] happening all the time now and the pace
[4694.52s] is not going to let up this guy this is
[4698.199s] his last run this is his Jerry Seinfeld
[4701.159s] go at the top go out at the top Brack
[4704.08s] and Daryl is winner and he&#39;s going to
[4705.92s] turn this thing and it&#39;s going to be a
[4707.28s] multibagger and everyone&#39;s going to look
[4709.12s] back at actually you know it&#39;s funny no
[4712.44s] one&#39;s going to look back and say wow
[4713.76s] that was such a great call you only hear
[4716.32s] when it&#39;s not working you never hear
[4718.04s] when people cash in for a five bagger
[4719.639s] and they&#39;re like wow that was
[4720.639s] unbelievable you never get that call
[4722.52s] it&#39;s always like when is this one gonna
[4724.239s] work you know it&#39;s like unbelievable uh
[4726.719s] the gift that never gives all right uh
[4730.76s] Van&#39;s plan quote so what are we doing we
[4733.6s] so we&#39;re innovating and also putting in
[4735.719s] franchise management so innovating by
[4737.76s] bringing out new Styles uh so you&#39;ve
[4740.52s] seen you&#39;re starting to see them come
[4742.6s] out one at a time now AV 2.0 that&#39;s what
[4745.8s] the skater guy was talking to me about
[4747.36s] on Fifth Avenue the new school three new
[4750.08s] Styles this quarter and we&#39;ll have more
[4752.56s] coming and then some really key
[4755.0s] collaborations to give energy and then
[4757.56s] franchise management when you&#39;re going
[4760.199s] to see us take the gas out of some of
[4763.32s] the older styles for a while and then
[4766.36s] Rego them when we
[4769.159s] first at the very top of the culture
[4772.32s] chain with key influencers and then flow
[4775.639s] them down so what are they
[4777.88s] doing everyone and their mother bought
[4780.159s] Vans three years ago they got every
[4781.92s] color of checkerboard uh slip-ons in
[4784.52s] their in their uh closet because it was
[4788.0s] hot it was trendy and that&#39;s what Vans
[4790.679s] does since the 1950s is it runs in
[4793.28s] cycles and so they&#39;re not going to jam
[4796.4s] something that people have in their
[4799.04s] closet what are they doing they&#39;re
[4800.48s] coming out with brand new stuff to get
[4802.36s] people excited about the Vans brand like
[4805.48s] they&#39;re doing with new school like
[4807.199s] they&#39;re doing with AV 2.0 like they&#39;re
[4810.199s] doing with the ultra long or whatever
[4812.04s] that&#39;s called um uh maybe I got the
[4815.159s] wrong ones the C the uh lowlands which I
[4818.08s] think are cool as hell and
[4820.96s] um so they keep putting these out and
[4823.52s] then once they hit Peak
[4826.12s] excitement and everyone wants Vans then
[4830.08s] they&#39;re going to flow through the
[4831.4s] classic stuff that goes bananas and
[4833.6s] you&#39;re going to see revenues just hockey
[4835.36s] stick like nobody&#39;s business but they&#39;re
[4837.48s] creating the buzz they&#39;re laying the
[4838.88s] foundation and then they&#39;re going to jam
[4840.44s] the channels but they&#39;re not going to do
[4842.08s] that right now so they&#39;re going to degas
[4844.0s] it and then Rego it and look I&#39;ve never
[4847.239s] run a footwear company but I&#39;ll tell you
[4849.0s] what I like hearing that he has a plan
[4851.12s] and he knows exactly how this is going
[4852.679s] to go just like he said what was going
[4854.08s] to happen with Europe just like he said
[4855.96s] what was going to happen by bringing the
[4857.28s] platform over just like he said he was
[4859.0s] going to sell a key part of the
[4860.52s] portfolio to delever the balance sheet
[4862.199s] and invest in growth just like he said
[4864.48s] dot dot dot dot dot both Shane o Kelly
[4867.52s] and Brack and Daryl bet on the jockey
[4870.12s] they&#39;re doing exactly what they said
[4872.52s] it&#39;s just it&#39;s the day Traders and the
[4874.32s] emotional morons that it doesn&#39;t go fast
[4877.28s] enough lose out the opportunity so we&#39;ll
[4879.6s] sell a piece of our stock to them at $50
[4882.28s] and we&#39;ll sell some more to them at $80
[4884.36s] and will give them as much as they want
[4885.679s] at $100 and sold to you and it&#39;ll go up
[4888.4s] to1 110 and they&#39;ll hold it to 50
[4891.159s] because they&#39;re so excited about the
[4892.639s] story at 110 just like everyone&#39;s so
[4895.159s] excited about $3 trillion Nvidia that&#39;s
[4898.52s] going to grow at 40% a year just do some
[4901.4s] math ladies and gentlemen rule is 72 72
[4905.04s] divided by 40 which means the company&#39;s
[4907.32s] going to double every 1.75 years so in
[4910.56s] three and a half years the company will
[4912.88s] go from three trillion to 6 trillion to
[4915.28s] 12 trillion 50% of GDP in 3 and a half
[4920.76s] years based on current cell side
[4922.88s] estimates for long-term growth you can&#39;t
[4925.239s] make this stuff up and when I said to
[4926.8s] Kelly it&#39;s like the inmates are running
[4928.56s] the Asylum welcome to Crazy Town I mean
[4931.04s] you you literally can&#39;t make this stuff
[4932.719s] up like how people sync that math is
[4935.6s] beyond me so leaving that aside unless
[4939.159s] we can start eating gpus and building
[4941.28s] houses with gpus I think the probability
[4943.6s] is low so uh gross
[4946.88s] margin
[4949.32s] uh quote we do expect gross margin to
[4952.32s] improve throughout the year so that&#39;s
[4954.0s] all good there a million things here you
[4956.0s] can go through we are going to get you
[4957.92s] to the beach we&#39;re already an hour and
[4959.36s] change in and we got to get to uh fear
[4961.88s] and greed is still neutral that&#39;s a good
[4963.44s] thing if we expect a couple more weeks
[4964.84s] of
[4965.84s] strength earnings came in a little bit
[4969.44s] uh but this doesn&#39;t account for
[4970.52s] weightings of stocks but just an
[4971.96s] aggregate Dow down 1.92 for this year
[4975.76s] 1.21 for next year it&#39;s probably skewed
[4977.92s] into one stock you can look at it on the
[4979.679s] website NASDAQ came down a bunch more uh
[4983.08s] this has to be one company
[4985.44s] 7.6 76 which is why we&#39;ve been
[4988.84s] saying mag 7 decelerating UNM mag 493
[4993.12s] accelerating where do you want to put
[4994.28s] your money UNM mag 493 divid and pay
[4997.12s] small caps Emerging Markets IE
[4999.36s] China uh be interested to see which
[5002.56s] company is respons I for a lot of
[5010.28s] this H he did the numbers wrong here all
[5013.88s] right
[5019.639s] well all right we&#39;ll get this redone
[5021.76s] we&#39;ll get it posted this is getting
[5026.56s] deleted all right moving
[5030.56s] on uh
[5037.56s] economic
[5038.679s] data durable goods orders this shot the
[5041.159s] lights out that&#39;s a good sign retail
[5043.159s] sales had been good that&#39;s not this week
[5044.88s] I&#39;m talking about last week so it&#39;s
[5046.199s] confirmatory that there&#39;s still some
[5047.639s] strength there Atlanta GDP now at
[5050.92s] 2% uh initial jobless claims today were
[5055.76s] in line with expectations but still with
[5057.679s] the two handles so that&#39;s uh you know
[5060.0s] that&#39;s what&#39;s got the FED in action here
[5062.96s] 231 versus 233 last print pce prices
[5066.84s] came down tomorrow we&#39;re going to see
[5069.36s] pce which people think is important I
[5071.6s] think it&#39;s less important than the jobs
[5073.08s] report at this point let&#39;s move on to
[5075.12s] the ask me anything questions so for
[5076.56s] those of you who don&#39;t like ask me
[5077.6s] anything questions thank you for tuning
[5079.679s] in we&#39;ll be back next week for those of
[5081.56s] you who do like ask me anything
[5083.199s] questions here we go and thanks for
[5085.32s] submitting
[5087.08s] them okay number
[5091.28s] one John Manza why is GX appearing to
[5095.0s] dilute shareholders a shelf offering
[5096.96s] number
[5097.88s] one you do a shelf offering proactively
[5101.04s] so if they have you know if I&#39;m a CEO
[5104.28s] and I expect really good things to
[5105.679s] happen in a in a reasonable amount of
[5107.679s] time I want a shelf offering in place
[5109.639s] because if I get to some ridiculous
[5111.36s] valuation before the fundamentals
[5113.36s] support it I want to be able to say sold
[5115.119s] to you in the Shelf offering that I
[5117.4s] viewed there was no Clarity around size
[5119.96s] or Price or anything I think they just
[5121.719s] did it as a kind of like you buy in
[5124.32s] Insurance in the future or they could be
[5126.92s] doing a shelf offering if they have to
[5130.4s] uh if they want to buy a company and use
[5132.44s] stock to do it as well so it&#39;s unclear
[5134.92s] whether at all any delution is going to
[5137.32s] be the case I&#39;m not worried about those
[5139.4s] guys because they have decades worth of
[5142.28s] history in creating shareholder wealth
[5144.8s] not destroying it not doing dumb deals
[5147.4s] not diluting shareholders and this time
[5149.88s] will be no different moving
[5152.52s] on uh
[5155.04s] etay Naman loyal listener yes etay I
[5158.52s] know you&#39;ve been with us for a long time
[5159.96s] excited to see a Fed cut soon POS gdq
[5162.28s] stock conect weakening dollar com
[5164.239s] together all at
[5165.52s] once uh would love to Ticker
[5171.639s] on
[5173.32s] Z oom d
[5188.4s] all right let&#39;s see what this is I I
[5191.119s] wonder if he&#39;s referring to regular
[5194.4s] Zoom no
[5196.52s] Zoom
[5200.88s] d h this is a tiny trading vehicle we
[5205.239s] would never put clients in something
[5206.639s] like this but I&#39;ll take a quick look at
[5208.4s] it z o
[5211.76s] m d
[5214.56s] oh it&#39;s a Canadian
[5217.239s] company all right cash flow revenues are
[5219.92s] rolling
[5221.679s] over free cashow has gone up a little
[5224.84s] bit growth margins are up this is a
[5227.44s] strange company what are these guys
[5236.28s] doing marketing technology user
[5239.04s] acquisition engagement platforms
[5241.28s] worldwide that&#39;s more ambiguous than any
[5244.199s] anything I&#39;ve ever heard in my life
[5245.239s] operates a mobile app user acquisition
[5247.4s] platform that integrates with various
[5249.199s] digital media Outlets unified view of
[5251.6s] mar resources
[5253.639s] comprehensive the only word they don&#39;t
[5255.56s] have in here is AI I mean this sounds
[5258.04s] like a big promote so if you want to
[5260.84s] play
[5262.32s] the I&#39;ll be smarter than the suckers
[5264.92s] game have at it for
[5267.32s] me I don&#39;t know I see declining
[5271.56s] revenues I see
[5274.48s] I&#39;m sure they have a decent balance
[5276.239s] sheet 4 million of
[5280.88s] cash zero
[5283.36s] debt cash flow from
[5287.4s] operations is spotty but I think that&#39;re
[5290.48s] free cash flow positive
[5294.0s] yes uh I have to see the composition of
[5299.88s] that this is a $3 million company I mean
[5302.679s] I can&#39;t really say anything about
[5305.199s] this
[5308.08s] um yeah it&#39;s not for me it doesn&#39;t mean
[5310.32s] it&#39;s not going to work I mean I&#39;d have
[5311.56s] to do 10 hours of work on this for me to
[5313.36s] even look at it and I don&#39;t I&#39;m not able
[5315.76s] to do that so um so for me it&#39;s a pass
[5319.92s] uh doesn&#39;t mean it won&#39;t work Philip
[5321.92s] Andrew Andrew pinkos hey Tom thank you
[5324.639s] for the invaluable insights you provide
[5326.32s] you&#39;ve unknowingly become a significant
[5327.76s] mentor to me what are your thoughts on
[5329.32s] Dollar General and Dollar Tree I&#39;m
[5331.4s] curious about your entry point for
[5332.719s] Dollar General I appre okay I&#39;ll I&#39;ll
[5334.88s] tell you my exact entry point before I
[5336.88s] do it now uh uh we&#39;re not close to doing
[5340.28s] anything with this but we are uh paying
[5342.76s] attention to it so the answer is not yet
[5346.28s] and more likely than not not ever but
[5354.08s] um you know 50 60 bucks I would take a I
[5357.48s] would take I would start to do real work
[5359.04s] on it but for now this is a broken
[5360.88s] growth stock and these things take
[5362.76s] forever uh I&#39;ll probably be buying it in
[5366.239s] one and a half to two years a lot lower
[5369.48s] although Dollar Tree looks better I mean
[5371.48s] In fairness Dollar
[5373.56s] General could could snap back but let
[5376.28s] let me just take a look at the
[5377.239s] fundamentals I mean I think their com
[5378.96s] store sales were up 1.4% I had a busy
[5381.8s] day today so I didn&#39;t get to dig into
[5383.639s] that one but
[5386.639s] um let&#39;s see so they started recovering
[5390.48s] free cash flow Revenue so they must have
[5392.48s] said something really bad I&#39;m GNA spend
[5394.92s] some time on this this week because this
[5396.56s] is my knitting but I really don&#39;t think
[5400.199s] I would feel I would love to see it puke
[5402.199s] for another couple days down to like a
[5403.76s] six handle I mean at 60 bucks even if I
[5406.679s] buy it at that price and I have to wait
[5408.679s] three years for it to build a base or
[5410.36s] two years like we did with Baba and then
[5412.119s] it goes back to you know 150 or
[5414.76s] something like that then that that&#39;s a
[5416.159s] good irr but I think you&#39;re going to
[5418.48s] have plenty of time to buy it and uh my
[5422.44s] guess is they&#39;re going to be in the
[5423.48s] store closing business because this is
[5425.44s] discretionary versus necessity like
[5427.76s] Advanced Auto Parts is you don&#39;t go into
[5429.84s] Advanced Auto Parts you know they don&#39;t
[5432.08s] have Advanced Auto Parts at the local
[5433.639s] mall because you want to browse like you
[5435.239s] do for Lululemon or apple watches uh you
[5438.48s] go to Advanced Auto Parts because your
[5440.0s] car is not working and you need to get
[5441.32s] to work so that&#39;s why we like that part
[5443.96s] of the turnaround story even though the
[5445.36s] weekend of the customer is weak um but
[5449.4s] this could get cheap enough quickly that
[5451.08s] we would just definitely take a flyer uh
[5454.08s] we&#39;re just not close to those levels
[5456.28s] right now and we probably have to do an
[5459.52s] analysis between them and Dollar Tree
[5461.76s] and F
[5466.08s] uh Five Below and all those guys and
[5469.76s] see which is that got in this pull
[5473.639s] position because when a when a sector is
[5475.6s] dislocated meaningfully we like to buy
[5477.8s] the highest quality in the most
[5479.679s] dislocated kind of like 2022 when we
[5482.239s] were buying Banks and energy we bought
[5484.28s] Exxon and we bought uh Wells Fargo uh in
[5487.84s] China highest quality we bought
[5490.48s] Alibaba uh and when that sector starts
[5493.679s] to recover they&#39;re going to do
[5495.84s] fantastic um and I think it&#39;s gonna be
[5497.76s] sooner than everyone
[5499.199s] expects but Philipe you are right on and
[5502.679s] you&#39;re early will e do you think
[5506.119s] Advanced Auto Parts can reach a similar
[5507.88s] evaluation AutoZone no I don&#39;t um I
[5512.84s] think advance Auto can be a pretty easy
[5516.199s] double over the next few years and more
[5519.56s] likely you know even a triple if this
[5522.36s] guy really runs it right
[5524.96s] but um AutoZone is a much bigger
[5529.4s] business and there&#39;s no way this thing
[5531.44s] is going to be uh 40 bagger you know let
[5535.08s] let&#39;s just put that to rest I
[5539.4s] mean I like your optimism will but it&#39;s
[5542.44s] it&#39;s it&#39;s got a lot of lifting to do
[5544.199s] we&#39;re we&#39;re looking for a double or
[5546.84s] triple in a reasonable amount of time
[5548.76s] and then we&#39;ll look at the financials
[5550.08s] then and we&#39;ll look at the things maybe
[5551.92s] we get a four or five bagger if we&#39;re
[5554.36s] lucky but I don&#39;t think we get from uh
[5557.199s] you know just to pull these two
[5562.119s] together quickly here I think
[5566.4s] uh you got
[5568.96s] Advance which
[5571.28s] is you know a two and a half 2 .7
[5574.36s] billion business and you have AutoZone
[5576.44s] which is like 20 times that 54 billion
[5580.92s] business I I don&#39;t think it&#39;s going to
[5582.8s] get to a 54 billion business I
[5585.04s] definitely think it&#39;s getting back I
[5586.4s] think it&#39;s getting easily not easily but
[5589.28s] I think it&#39;s getting to to a 10 billion
[5591.8s] dollar business for sure uh I think they
[5594.36s] can do that if they do it well and um
[5598.639s] and we&#39;ll be perfectly happy with that
[5600.639s] and then when everyone says it&#39;s going
[5601.88s] to be the next Auto Zone we will be
[5603.4s] saying
[5604.6s] sold to
[5609.719s] you uh said uh just made a statement to
[5614.199s] thank me for everything thank you for
[5615.679s] listening
[5619.639s] onen
[5621.52s] uh again just a reminder for all these
[5623.92s] people that applied for the video job
[5626.08s] gig and didn&#39;t get it video editor uh I
[5629.32s] do need an admin for all those posts
[5631.08s] that we talked about early on if you
[5632.92s] applied for the video job and you want
[5634.96s] the admin job you will have greater
[5637.159s] waiting than all the other people
[5639.0s] applying for the admin
[5641.679s] job
[5644.679s] um all right Carrie jessen I&#39;d be
[5647.92s] interested in you on Foot Locker you
[5649.44s] often talking about the jockey and Matt
[5650.88s] Dylan the new CEO came from Ulta Bea
[5653.32s] Beauty with 16% kager seems to be doing
[5656.08s] a lot of great things and they have this
[5657.76s] quar a return to growth and expecting 8%
[5660.04s] ebit margin in a couple years
[5679.84s] oh this is
[5680.88s] interesting uh wow good work car k a a e
[5687.199s] says by the way their CCO name is Frank
[5690.719s] Bracken
[5694.56s] and mentioned on this quarter&#39;s call
[5696.6s] that quote and while the vulcanized
[5699.32s] Footwear category remains challenged
[5701.719s] overall we&#39;re seeing encouraging Trends
[5704.48s] out of the Vans brand especially through
[5707.719s] their new school
[5710.92s] franchise so there you go Foot Locker
[5713.8s] let&#39;s take a
[5718.52s] look at some point I don&#39;t want so many
[5721.28s] retailers I having Advanced Auto par is
[5724.199s] enough um this has also turned a lot off
[5727.4s] the bottom so I kind of missed the boat
[5729.679s] on this so I&#39;ll take a quick look but
[5731.679s] for me uh I wouldn&#39;t put this in my
[5734.44s] portfolio if you&#39;re just looking
[5736.0s] discreetly at this without the context
[5738.48s] of a portfolio yes they are turning
[5740.08s] that&#39;s why the stocks doubled revenues
[5741.92s] are still weak gross margins are still
[5744.36s] declining uh let&#39;s see free cash flow oh
[5747.96s] just turned
[5749.239s] up uh yeah I just don&#39;t think there&#39;s
[5752.4s] enough upside relative to the risk it&#39;s
[5754.44s] still going to be a lowquality business
[5756.0s] that&#39;s going to be cyclical so you&#39;ll
[5757.639s] probably catch the next cycle but you
[5760.32s] already miss half the move even if it
[5762.679s] goes to
[5763.719s] 60 you have a
[5766.0s] double I mean from 14 to 16 is a four
[5769.08s] bagger I just uh not for me no I I don&#39;t
[5773.52s] like it but I like the fact that you&#39;re
[5774.84s] on VF with us and I think you&#39;re going
[5776.88s] to do just fine there over
[5778.88s] time um Eric Albright if you had no Ali
[5783.639s] Bob exposure would you consider taking a
[5785.199s] punt on PDD hell no unreliable or
[5791.0s] unsustainable uh also given the risk of
[5793.92s] poorly reported numbers what are your
[5796.44s] best resources tips on learning how to
[5798.08s] decode suspicious financials there are
[5800.719s] books on that
[5803.159s] um God I read them all probably when I
[5805.8s] was your age um Google Books on
[5809.28s] accounting
[5811.0s] irregularities um I would say this stay
[5814.239s] out of Chinese stocks except for the
[5816.159s] biggest and the best that&#39;ll save 90% of
[5818.76s] your problems with accounting fraud and
[5821.44s] uh other than that if it looks too good
[5823.679s] to be true uh you better do your work
[5826.719s] and you better do your channels checks
[5830.28s] um but there are techniques for it if
[5834.0s] that&#39;s the game that you want to play
[5835.88s] and there are several books uh maybe
[5837.679s] I&#39;ll post them on the website or
[5838.96s] something when I think of it um all
[5842.32s] right
[5848.36s] AMA okay this is from Bob Gman thank you
[5851.679s] for your time and education you give
[5852.84s] every week with lots of other fund
[5854.08s] managers and analysts predicting the
[5855.44s] dollars loss of fiat currency
[5858.88s] status what in your view happens if and
[5861.44s] when this takes
[5863.36s] place Bob gesman it&#39;s not going to
[5865.76s] happen um you&#39;ll consistently be able to
[5868.719s] get less for the same dollar over time I
[5871.08s] guarantee you that but you&#39;re not going
[5873.159s] to lose lose it and everyone else that&#39;s
[5875.159s] telling you you are they&#39;re either
[5876.44s] selling Bitcoin gold or books and um the
[5880.92s] only one that&#39;s going to benefit from
[5882.44s] taking that framework is the one selling
[5884.159s] you those things so I would just pass on
[5886.239s] that flawed framework that um is just
[5889.719s] not going to
[5890.88s] happen all
[5894.52s] right let&#39;s see
[5897.119s] here uh Matt Hiller says I was wondering
[5899.679s] why alibab is down 4% when PDD is having
[5901.8s] bad earnings I just said why because
[5903.599s] thought it was related to the Chinese
[5904.88s] consumer what it&#39;s related to is Alibaba
[5907.159s] is back to ass kicking and
[5917.159s] um Ronald Ronald I&#39;ll call you about
[5921.44s] what you had inquired
[5926.48s] about here&#39;s from Adam
[5931.159s] Hawk thanks for your question uh AAP
[5934.48s] number one Co targeted operating margin
[5936.88s] mid single digits as opposed to
[5939.04s] competitors AO riy why is he aiming so
[5941.96s] low uh because it&#39;s been mismanaged for
[5945.0s] five years plus uh is there fundamental
[5948.159s] reason for it there probably lower end
[5951.239s] uh in terms of the consumers and it&#39;s
[5953.84s] going to take some time to turn that
[5955.199s] around customers complaining about price
[5957.28s] not being competitive so they&#39;re not in
[5961.04s] line and and he says so they sell at
[5963.679s] higher prices only produce less profits
[5965.599s] yes because people don&#39;t buy at higher
[5967.159s] prices and they hadn&#39;t done the proper
[5968.88s] analysis World pack sale new CEO and
[5972.84s] third Point pushing but is that enough
[5975.159s] maybe not for you it&#39;s plenty for me
[5976.88s] because I&#39;ve done the work so I&#39;d
[5978.159s] suggest go through the article of the
[5979.96s] week or even more importantly go through
[5982.159s] the source materials you listen to the
[5984.36s] call you read the transcript you
[5986.84s] determine what&#39;s important you go
[5988.8s] through the last 12 calls you go through
[5991.199s] the last public three years of uh
[5993.96s] of annual reports and then you&#39;ll
[5996.36s] determine whether it&#39;s worth your dollar
[5998.76s] of investment that&#39;s where you win is
[6001.4s] when you go through the work what I try
[6002.84s] to do here is sh share 10% of my
[6006.4s] framework to what I do to get you
[6008.28s] started on the right path But ultimately
[6010.719s] you just have to put in the leg work in
[6012.36s] the time it&#39;s like golf you know you can
[6014.32s] read the best book on golf if you don&#39;t
[6016.32s] play two times a week and practice two
[6019.44s] three times a week you are not getting
[6021.239s] to a single digit handicap but by the
[6023.48s] way I got my swing back just in time for
[6025.08s] my chipping to go to but uh it&#39;s
[6027.719s] all going to come together I will find a
[6030.599s] way to get to wear my goal by the end of
[6032.96s] the year even if I&#39;m playing in a snow

[6092.88s] getting hit on the top golf
[6098.08s] piece and shutting a lot down I this has
[6101.199s] always been a garbage business the
[6102.679s] ticker used to be
[6104.599s] El I would never buy this business it&#39;s
[6107.08s] a it&#39;s a terrible business so um even
[6110.96s] though the demographic should be favor
[6113.32s] favorable see I still type in e y o
[6119.88s] g call me if it
[6122.04s] gets well it&#39;s already getting below 10

[6126.44s] 10 it&#39;s already there
[6131.04s] um I won&#39;t buy this business this is a
[6133.56s] trading vehicle so if it gets back down
[6135.88s] to like seven and a half or five buy it
[6138.52s] and just sit on it and sell it when it
[6140.08s] gets back up to 20 I I don&#39;t
[6144.4s] their margins continue to
[6146.32s] deteriorate th this is a garbage
