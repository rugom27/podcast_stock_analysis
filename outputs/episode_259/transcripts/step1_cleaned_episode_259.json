  "cleaned_transcript": "### MISCELLANEOUS\nwelcome to hedge fun tips with Tom Hayes I&#39;m Tom Hayes and this is your 259th podcast video cast for the week ending October 2nd 2024 we&#39;re going to try to keep this one under an hour these things have been going two hours every week because we&#39;ve had so much to talk about what but when everything&#39;s working and you have a record uh uh unbelievable situation going on there&#39;s not a whole lot to talk about as I as I always like to say we spend 80% of the time talking about the ones that haven&#39;t moved yet and uh you know five or 10% celebrating our winners so uh for everyone listening in China&#39;s working we don&#39;t have to spend a lot of time on that\n\n### MISCELLANEOUS\nwe&#39;re going to try to keep this one under an hour these things have been going two hours every week because we&#39;ve had so much to talk about what but when everything&#39;s working and you have a record uh uh unbelievable situation going on there&#39;s not a whole lot to talk about as I as I always like to say we spend 80% of the time talking about the ones that haven&#39;t moved yet and uh you know five or 10% celebrating our winners so uh for everyone listening in China&#39;s working we don&#39;t have to spend a lot of time on that\n\nthis is a photo with Walt Disney uh his statue when we just got in and there&#39;s a quote here you can enlarge it says uh it&#39;s from Disney himself quote we&#39;re just getting started and it&#39;s so appropo for what is happening with China\n\n### MEDIA_APPEARANCE_RECAP\nlet's just get to the floor show because it's Friday joining me now a great Hill Capital chairman Tom hay and the Fitzgerald group principal Keith Fitzgerald who said that Costco analysts have got it all wrong he sees a positive here first I'm going to turn to Tom Hayes though and get the macro picture as we finish up a week that's had so much news and a few decent records and gains yeah I think we've had two regime changes in two weeks livz so the first was the FED frontloading 50 basis point cuts which implies a couple of things are going to happen we're going to see follow through with the to see continued outperformance of small caps versus large caps first 12 months after a cut you get 11% outperformance of small caps and everyone's loaded into defensives I think we're going to move back to Consumer discretionary over consumer staples and that second regime change was the fiscal stimulus bazooka Emerging Markets now outperforming developed markets with China on the tear okay but you say Russell 2000 the small and midcaps when you say the UNM magnificent 493 and magnificent 7 so UNM magnificent 493 will outperform continue to outperform the Magnificent 7 which is Amazon Google meta Etc okay so you're saying the rest of the S&P is much more magnificent it's much more magnificent it's a c change that started to take place in the last few weeks and now accelerated with the 50 Bas oh you're talking to Keith Fitzgerald and he's been loving and making a lot of money off Nvidia Keith um what's your answer there to to what Tom's just said I think that is just pure genius the unmagnified credit of course I think that Tech is not all the same Liz and so as you know certain companies are going to do better than others so Amazon's got its challenges made has got his challenges but companies like Nvidia for example are going to run right back to the front of the pack whether it's the UNM magnificent or magnificent remains to be seen but plenty of party starting proposition here okay uh I got to get your thought on Costco because because while the official earning season has not yet begun it begins in a week or so with the big Banks Costco came out with numbers what are you saying the analyst got wrong that's sending the stock lower well here's the thing right Costco is one of those things you know trade the nudes or trade the reality and the reality situation is I'm not sure they were looking at the same report I was because I saw sales up I saw earnings up in the billions of dollars but the key takeaway\n\n### MEDIA_APPEARANCE_RECAP\nto see continued outperformance of small caps versus large caps first 12 months after a cut you get 11% outperformance of small caps and everyone&#39;s loaded into defensives I think we&#39;re going to move back to Consumer discretionary over consumer staples and that second regime change was the fiscal stimulus bazooka Emerging Markets now outperforming developed markets with China on the tear okay but you say Russell

reality and the reality situation is I&#39;m not sure they were looking at the same report I was because I saw sales up I saw earnings up in the billions of dollars but the key takeaway here is  they didn&#39;t even glance at this 50% of the new membership that Costco is selling if to under 40 age consumers that suggests to me t\n\n### MISCELLANEOUS\nthat suggests to me another group of costara in the blooming that could power this thing for decades to come the fact that it&#39;s down today is purely a technical move and an opportunity Tom&#39;s going to steal cost karate so you guys will be you guys will be even here U what&#39;s your counter to that Tom I mean how do you feel about the US economy we do obviously see that inflation is moderating continuing to moderate although the Core year-over-year pce 2 .7 while it matched it&#39;s still hotter than a year ago it it it&#39;s Goldilocks I mean things look good the only thing I&#39;m a little worried about by the way whenever Keith talks I listen Keith is a good buddy of mine so take a look at those names um the skew option skew is the cost to ensure one and two standard deviation d uh uh Corrections is at 10year highs so it doesn&#39;t mean you&#39;re automatically going to get a correction but you know pre-election volatility is pretty typical going back to 1955 in the in the month of October so we are staying fully invested but if you&#39;re on margin I would get off margin we&#39;re going to write out these bumps and then once the election clears we&#39;ll get a yearend rally okay a yearend rally I&#39;m wondering if that would include Keith Intel Intel of course has been at the center of individual stock\n\nhere is another group of costara in the blooming that could power this thing for decades to come the fact that it&#39;s down today is purely a technical move and an opportunity Tom&#39;s going to steal cost karate so you guys will be you guys will be even here U what&#39;s your counter to

we&#39;re going to write out these bumps and then once the election clears we&#39;ll get a yearend rally okay a yearend rally I&#39;m wondering if that would include Keith Intel ### HEADLINES_AND_NEWS\nIntel of course has been at the center of individual stock headlines\n\n### HEADLINES_AND_NEWS\n\n### HEADLINES_AND_NEWS\nthis week and at the end of last week Bloomberg&#39;s got a report the Wall Street journal&#39;s got a report that you know private Equity might come in and maybe Qualcomm maybe who knows what arm but but one thing that&#39;s been reported is that Intel&#39;s pretty much rebuffed a lot of this you know I got to tell you Pat gelsinger I&#39;ve met him several times is as bright as they come he&#39;s the right guy at the right time for that company the problem why I mean he&#39;s lagging here he&#39;s been at the helm for a couple of years so I think unfortunately Intel remains dead money I don&#39;t know why they rebuffed these offers because that could have been salvation it seems to me that there&#39;s a lot of blunt thinking inside their headquarters right now and it&#39;s going to be bad for shareholders okay well at least for the week I see Intel up about 88.7%\n\n### HEADLINES_AND_NEWS\nTom said listen to Keith&#39;s picks and I will tell you that had our viewers listened to you a couple of years ago about one particular stock stay in it stay in it stay in it they would have made a lot of money and that is Palante teer and we look at some of the gains here uh it&#39;s it&#39;s quite unbelievable hitting brand new records uh not unbelievable because you&#39;ve been here telling us about that where does the stock go you&#39;re you&#39;re very kind to remember that thank you I think we&#39;re going to take out 50 pretty quickly I&#39;m starting to think about 85 but three to five years from now there&#39;s zero doubt in my mind we&#39;re looking at a hundred bucks a share so it&#39;s going to be volatile going to be a tough stock to own but I encourage people to stay with it if you can yeah big Daya aggregator great to see you both have a good weekend gentlemen\n\n### HEADLINES_AND_NEWS\nplease pull up the DOW Industrials the smmp and the NASDAQ please they&#39;re they&#39;re moving south that is because the US has indications that Iran is preparing to launch a ballistic missile attack against Israel that would be a very very serious development in international relations an extension of the war and we&#39;d like to know what our response what America&#39;s response would be if this happened I think that&#39;s Weighing on the market now let&#39;s get back to the dock strike uh 45,000 workers on strike Tom Hayes joins me uh to watch the market for us do you expect Biden to intervene within a week as I&#39;m I&#39;m suggesting that in my opinion piece there what do you say I absolutely agree with you you Ste I think Biden&#39;s going to intervene he just doesn&#39;t know it yet because effectively the last thing you want to see going into an election is 401ks going down and the cost of eggs and wood and all the supplies to North Carolina going up this could be if they fumble the ball the best thing that ever happened to Donald Trump in terms of the election because uh right now we front-loaded a lot of shipping into the East Coast so for the next week it&#39;s only going to cost $34 billion after the first week it could start to cost $4 billion a day people are going to feel that and we&#39;re in a seasonally weak period of the stock market as a matter of fact in elections the next 10 days election years since 1955 are the most volatile and the lowest returns of the year of an election year so you compound that with Israel Iran you compound that with the strike I think he comes in in a week and a half and say if it&#39;s not resolved beforehand and says we&#39;re going to let this cool down to I don&#39;t know sometime in November well thank you right right but so you are telling me that if the strike lasts you know two weeks say the market will take a hit regardless of what President Biden does no question about it yeah I think the Market&#39;s going to start to extrapolate what that means uh in terms of you know 50% of the port shutting down can&#39;t get Goods Walmart&#39;s going to be hit Home Depot&#39;s going to be hit uh and then people will worry about the holidays as well so uh certainly the Public Public will even though a lot of the holiday supply has come in by the end of September uh as things run out as Price look consumer confidence it&#39;s been kind of dead on the mat why because prices are up so prices start to tick up again uh and they associate that with the Harris Biden Administration uh it&#39;s really going to bode well for Trump going into the election I want to get back to this breaking story the US has indications that Iran is preparing to launch a ballistic missile attack against Israel I&#39;m saying that that is part of the reason for the Market&#39;s decline we&#39;re down 3 30 now on the DOW Industrials is it a is it a big negative for the overall Market I think so we had indications of this headline uh midn next mid last week and we saw this type of volatility mid last week uh this is a factor and you have to think about see that on the screen right now uh the yield on the 10-year treasury is down that is the result of a flight to safety that&#39;s people putting money into dead safe 10year Treasures is that 10 yes it is the 10 year forcing the price up and the yield down right to safety that&#39;s my opinion vix is up oil is up 3% oil is at $70 a barrel I think on this breaking store it&#39;s happening as we speak it&#39;s interesting uh that last time I was on I said if you&#39;re on margin come off margin and the reason I said that is the skew which is the price to ensure against a one standard deviation correction think of 10% correction hit 10year highs in the last week that doesn&#39;t guarantee a correction but it indicates that uh we&#39;re fully invested but we&#39;re off of margin we we&#39;ll write out these short-term bumps through the election I think we we&#39;ll do fine after the election but you have to keep that in mind uh we made a lot of money don&#39;t borrow money to buy stocks it&#39;s not a good not right now\n\n### QUOTES_OF_THE_WEEK\nto buy when others are despondently selling and sell when others are euphorically buying takes the greatest courage but provides the greatest profit I can&#39;t tell you how many of you uh came to me and um have have uh expressed your gratitude for hanging in there and buying in the hole when no one was and we were buying every single week it was red and now you guys have made a ton of money\n\n### FEATURED_COMPANY_DEEP_DIVES\nas great and most incredible as things are rocking and rolling uh just want to keep in mind that uh we&#39;re just getting started as Walt Disney would say cuz most of our great picks are just now beginning to leave the station you know Baba as much as it&#39;s moved 70% off the lows in a handful of minutes uh you know this will consolidate and this will work higher there&#39;s no question about it uh Baxter same thing it&#39;s moved a lot from 32 to 40 but again just getting started this thing&#39;s going to work higher over the next few years with the turnaround plan two billion dollars of cost out of the business um $13 reducing cost they did they did what they said they were going to do as far as selling deleveraging doing all the plans CPS we just got great Auto Sales in September up from 151 run rate in August to 157 in September and that&#39;s before the cuts and incentives even start into year end so very excited about that my goodness it would have been the best quarter of ever uh it might have been but uh might have been the best quarter of ever um uh if you had CPS also but I think CPS is going to be the fourth quarter story which we&#39;re very excited about Disney I can&#39;t tell you how crowded the parks were and how amazing the experience was nothing to think about there they&#39;re raising the prices at uh Disney plus people have to have Disney if they have children if they don&#39;t Social Services comes in and takes your children away that thing is Off to the Races gener same story sad story for the people in Florida I hope everyone is doing well um uh managing through it but this demand is going to continue to increase and increase with the unstable grid and electricity demand Intel opportunity of a lifetime we bought in the High Teens as it flushed out we&#39;ll probably buy some more if it goes back and retests small caps just working their way higher I think this is again a fourth quarter story after the election like it usually is November December favors small caps and that&#39;s when we break to new highs which is pretty exciting as you know we got rid of the big Banks over the summer took profits uh but we kept our regionals this is going to work higher with small caps over time and to new highs we&#39;re excited about that PayPal rocketing off the bottom from 50 to 80 however it&#39;s just getting started ladies and gentlemen yes it&#39;s a huge move and yes it&#39;ll consolidate and yes it will work higher this is a huge position for us as well as Baba uh Stanley black and&amp; deck are breaking out here from this consolidation range it&#39;ll consolidate and work higher to new highs over the next few years this is the most exciting time ever to be involved in markets and picking stocks because this once in a 100 year uh situation with Co created the most incredible amazing opportunity that&#39;s slipping away from us by the way if you don&#39;t get new money in uh you know in the next couple of quarters uh you can still do well but but the wholesale opportunities that are still out there yes they&#39;re moving up and yes we are uh super excited about that but we want everyone on the train with us to take full advantage and um uh it&#39;s it&#39;s unbelievable because you know in the case of Baba it&#39;s like yeah yo so you bring your basis all the way down to the low 80s and then you know boom it shoots up to 115 but the options we had it&#39;s it&#39;s staggering what&#39;s happening with some of these four five 6X 7x and taking a little bit of uh WIS on those that expire in January it&#39;s unbelievable and um and VF Corp VF little little old VF Corp is now knocking on the door 20 we haven&#39;t even had a time to talk about it it&#39;s up from 10 to 20 and no one is even paying attention to it I love this stuff uh biotech also starting to break out I mean it&#39;s been all of this stuff and remember we kept saying wait till the FED Cuts wait till the fed well it&#39;s here ladies and gentlemen small caps China biotech small capat the the whole thing is playing out according to plan\n\n### MACRO_DATA_SLIDES\nlet&#39;s talk about some of the data for the week consecutive weekly declines in US 30-year mortgage rate uh eight weekly declines this is going to continue I think we&#39;ll see a it went from 7.2 to 6.12 I think we will see a high five handle maybe by the end of the year certainly by first quarter and that&#39;s going to ignite the housing market which will benefit uh further benefit Stanley Black and&amp; Decker further benefit um JRA and others gaval put this out over the last two decades China has had five big Equity rallies three of which have been fueled by stimulus we could be at the beginning of a fourth stimulus rally which raises expectations of 50 to 100% gains it&#39;s so interesting to see all the groups that were excessively negative on China and bearish now that they&#39;re up you know 50 70% a lot of these stocks off the bottom in a matter of weeks uh they&#39;re all saying uh they&#39;re excited and just getting started and uh so they were telling people to sell 50% ago and now they&#39;re telling them to buy which means we probably consolidate at some point in the next few weeks and then um uh punish all the ones chasing at you know 120 130 and um uh and then they&#39;ll sell back at 110 and and and um and then it&#39;ll take up take back off to 150 so we covered that last week uh HSI shares has triggered its strongest breath advance in history a classic bull market initiation signal so that&#39;s good news the cost of bearish bets slumps as China stocks rally Global monetary easing September saw the biggest month of easing since April of 2020 this is something we&#39;ve been talking about for months that&#39;s playing out if you did you want to be a buyer or seller uh when this type of easing happened in the first quarter of 2020 you wanted to be a buyer and we were go back to the podcast tapes we were one of the few and it was one of the biggest most incredible years ever uh and then um uh 2009 same story so that that&#39;s that this is shows the seasonality of the first 10 days of October in an election presidential election year from 1928 this is the most volatile um a negative uh period of the Year doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;ll uh necessarily repeat but uh it&#39;s nice that uh we we built up some cash we sold Centum in the last couple of weeks we sold um and we took a lot of uh profits across a slew of options that were up four five 6 7x spreads Etc and um and uh and then after the first 10 days you move into a more favorable period and then following the election straight up that&#39;s a positive thing\n\n### MISCELLANEOUS\nokay so this is talking about if the market does well from July through October then the existing party stays in power if it does poorly the new party gets in power that makes sense we&#39;ll see how it plays out this time there&#39;s this consumer conf confidence factor and as I said on vanney if they fumble the strike and and stock prices 401K start to go down and prices start to go up uh that could change the whole Dynamics if they get to it quickly you know it&#39;s it&#39;s probably um we&#39;ll we&#39;ll see how it plays out but uh I think as it stands the Republicans will get the Senate the Democrats probably get the house and the presidency is a coin flip based on what happens in the next few weeks weeks uh economic surprise Index this is turning up that&#39;s what you see in expansions not contractions median floor area decreased remember we&#39;ve been covering this for three years we said not every starter home needs to be 5,000 square foot with an indoor pool uh that you know people can actually have a th000 and 2,000 square foot homes and like they did in um I think levit town in the 50s that&#39;s starting to play out that&#39;s going to allow a lot more people into the starter home land which is a good thing uh long dated US Treasury returns near 62- we lows so we&#39;ve had that huge rally off the bottom I think that&#39;s going to consolidate for a while um uh us large cap 10year rolling returns well above historical average I think that&#39;s overdone a little bit give small caps a chance give Emerging Markets Emerging Markets outperform developed which we covered on Liz uh small small greater than large um small greater than large Emerging Markets greater than developed markets value over growth unmagnify over Consumer Staples that&#39;s those are the themes going forward China msci earnings per share um trading at uh forward p ps is 6.5 times it&#39;s unbelievable and uh this is uh just showing at the bottom of the range msci profit margins are going up in the last two years not down this is msci China by the way this is all from yardeni uh valuation multiple again High single digit still even after this rally which is super exciting\n\n### MACRO_DATA_SLIDES\nEconomic surprise Index this is turning up that&#39;s what you see in expansions not contractions median floor area decreased remember we&#39;ve been covering this for three years we said not every starter home needs to be 5,000 square foot with an indoor pool uh that you know people can actually have a th000 and

a list of draw downs from Wisdom Tree Russell still trading below we like Russ small caps Russell 2000 and Emerging Markets these are your two big money opportunities ladies and gentlemen for the next 18 months that&#39;s going to continue I love I can&#39;t stop posting this chart uh with China short China equities was one of the most crowded trades for the last few months uh that they can&#39;t even get out of their shorts it&#39;s I mean could you imagine these guys are upside down 100% in a matter of weeks you&#39;re going to see a lot of them blow up the people that have been short and and um and that&#39;s the story Emerging Markets versus developed markets performance you can see it here hockey stick straight up cyclicals versus defensive starting to pick up now uh everyone crowded into defensives ahead of the cut we covered the economic surprise index here&#39;s the composition of S&P Equity capitalization you can see Tech at 32% but they&#39;re only 21% of the earnings so that&#39;s why we say large cap underperforms or magnificent 7even underperforms un magnificent 493 you can see sector by sector I think uh an interesting story here would be uh financials at 21% of the earnings and 133% of the weight so that uh speaks to the small cap uh that speaks to the um uh um Regional Bank index that we we still hold\n\nhere is a list of draw downs from Wisdom Tree Russell still trading below we like Russ small caps Russell 2000 and Emerging Markets these are your two big money opportunities ladies and gentlemen for the next 18 months that&#39;s going to

was September uh strongest Q3 since 2020 marked by a big rotation equal weight S&amp;P jumped 99.4% versus the cap weighted S&amp;P five 5.5 what does that mean UNM magnificent 493 outperformed magnificent 7 which has been our theme for weeks and weeks and weeks we&#39;ve been talking about this it&#39;s played out 67% of the stocks in the S&amp;P 500 outperformed the index in Q3 998th percentile in history his ly only 31% of the stocks in the S&amp;P ever outperform the index value over growth for the first quarter since fourth quarter of 2022 dividend shine midcaps break out of the middle of the to lead September midcaps were up uh let&#39;s see like wrest after leaving the corter okay so midcaps are taking off stocks you don&#39;t pick make all of the difference uh so 69% outperform this quarter which is exciting and then indices so this is interesting I highlighted energy because it&#39;s doing so poorly uh energy and materials are two areas I&#39;ve got my eyes on as it relates to energy we have com stock we think that&#39;s going to work higher that&#39;s plenty but we are looking at some of we&#39;re not looking at the integrated they&#39;re not cheap enough for us uh we are looking at some of the servicers we may have more to say about that in coming weeks but for now we have nothing to say uh materials we&#39;re looking in that space we have a small position we&#39;ve talked about in albamar that&#39;s starting to take off uh off the mat uh but nothing um there but that&#39;s an area that we&#39;re starting to spend more time looking at and then um index relative price return distribution analysis so yeah you can see energy and materials have underperformed so we think that&#39;s going to be the story maybe late this year and certainly next year Healthcare a lot of opportunities biotech is going to work higher raising materials to overweight from Market weight again that&#39;s from Bank of America because of China stimulus because fed cutting in F cutting into an accelerating profit cycle means reflation long onlys are underweight materials a decade of underinvestment in manufacturing we&#39;re seeing that construction manufacturing start to take off Dr copper is turning up and new household formation is next because why engagement recovery is happening searches for engagement rings are up significantly in recent months according to Signet CEO dros on September 12th this makes sense to Lorraine Hutchinson uh typical three-year cycle of meet date engagement was stalled by covid but likely recovered by 2021 new household formation generally follows which is linked to materials returns new housing formation materials so we want to take advantage underinvestment in structure tangible cap capex since 1990 that&#39;s starting to pick back up um materials trades below its historical premium so again we want to look let me make another note to myself find some action in materials find some action in oil servicers and uh we&#39;ll see how uh the opportunity presents itself in coming weeks Bank of America analyst positive in the last three months on Industrials and materials so do they&#39;re doing more upgrades than downgrades uh sectors that do well uh after the first cut looking out healthc care is W so that biotech that we have is going to be phenomenal and we&#39;re going to get paid just like Baba for waiting and we&#39;re going to be paid bigly as they say uh biggest relative overweight in defensive versus cyclical since May TW 20 this is what we&#39;ve been talking about that&#39;s started to change now the discretionary are outperforming the Staples I think we&#39;ll we&#39;ll have some opport opportunities in uh October to pick some up on the cheap which is why we&#39;ve raised some cash which we&#39;re excited about uh and risk appetite is at 11-month low so dips are to be bought people are still skeptical then you&#39;ve also got tax loss harvesting brace for Red October uh tax loss harvesting from institutional investors became increasingly prevalent after the tax reform act in 1986 which mandated October 31st as the cut off for most mutual funds to realize capital gains tax loss selling by institutional investors October is also empirically borne out by flows and performance since 1986 stocks down 10% or more as of September month end have consistently lagged the S&amp;P in October by an average of 85 basis points and a stable ended performance hit rate of 63% before November&#39;s bounceback we screen for S&amp;P stocks down over 10% year-to date underweight by long only and they go through a bunch of lists so um US stocks that can this is not that list this is a different list first US stocks that can benefit from a rally in Chinese equities for those of you who are scared to own China equities and missed out on all this what comes to the to the top of the list J Estee louder and Stanley Black and&amp; Decker so we&#39;re getting two three bites at the Apple US Stocks with sales exposure to China uh that are going to benefit Qualcomm is interesting I wouldn&#39;t mind seeing the Qualcomm Intel I don&#39;t think it&#39;s going to come together I&#39;d probably buy Qualcomm discreetly but Intel is a better deal for me uh but if they came came together I would hold hoddle till the cows come home um other companies that uh have sales exposure to China I China recovers they&#39;ll benefit Las Vegas Sands um Intel uh let&#39;s see here APD I want to look at that one eBay I didn&#39;t realize that that&#39;s interesting Starbucks obviously Nike Lululemon um wi Resorts obviously all right dividends likely to contribute more to Total returns during than during the last decade we&#39;ve covered this dividend payers are dividend yield is still inexpensive relative to history it hasn&#39;t been this cheap since 2001 this goes back to our repeated analog 2002 to 2007 hedge funds exposure to cyclical versus defensives is just off an all-time low which is why you want to own cyclicals they&#39;ve been underweight they will be chasing up just like they&#39;re chasing in China and late to the park and then long and short the longest and shortest sectors the shortest is energy um so again I think we&#39;re going to see some opportunity there hedge funds have the highest relative exposure versus the S&amp;P to industrial&#39;s lowest to energy so again energy there&#39;s got to be a pony in that pile we have com stock we&#39;re going to probably out a serer and uh we&#39;ll take it from there Commodities 10year rolling returns uh ju yes it&#39;s at 10e Highs but it&#39;s coming like off depression death from 2000 and a long way to run in that story um fund manager survey underweight resources Commodities Emerging Markets versus history they&#39;re going to have to play catchup so energy again Industrials um Emerging Markets what do they overweight utilities uh so you know we&#39;ve talked about utilities uh no one wanted them in October when we were pounding the table uh last year and everyone wants them up 50 60% now we think that&#39;s going to a little bit long in the tooth as to consolidate those gains jobless claims sync to four-month low businesses aren&#39;t hiring or firing many people maau Hotel occupancy rate back to pre pandemic levels this is a big big deal that&#39;s a indicative of China consumer and VIPs and the wealthy feeling better about things energy sector versus the S&amp;P broke this downtrend I most technical analysts say this is terrible this is bad I think this is still uh I think this is representing an opportunity retail continues to have significant size bias in favor of large over smid smid and M cap uh that&#39;s exactly what you want to take the opposite side is retail chases the large cap uh the nvidias ETC and uh the opportuni is going to be in the small and mid and already is uh consumer sentiment starting to tick back up this Port strike will see how it&#39;s handled could could take it back down uh temporarily manufacturing and Warehouse construction going through the roof in line with our themes we&#39;ve been talking about construction spending is now ticking back up uh Stanley gener Etc we&#39;ve been positioned for that job openings are ticking back up that&#39;s a good sign probably because of the rate cut and uh some positive outlook there job openings monthly change the biggest ad is been in construction and food services and local government excluding education manufacturing we covered that uh GDP now estimates for Q3 are at 2.5% economic surprise index Just Hockey sticking up that&#39;s what you see in expansions not contraction ports affected by the strike handle about 25% of total us Goods Imports 2.8% of GDP and 27% of total us good exports 1.9% of GDP so it&#39;s not it&#39;s totally material it&#39;s not completely devastating it&#39;s going to be a key of time they can let it go for a week because uh they already front loaded all the shipping to the West Coast and to the east coast ahead of this deadline but after a week it&#39;s going to start to cost four or five billion a day and then you&#39;re going to see the pain in the Walmarts the Ikeas the Samsungs Bob&#39;s Discount Furniture Home Depot Etc we covered this last week head fund billionaire David teer says he&#39;s loading up on China stocks after the nation stimulus bazooka so after they&#39;re up 50 60% but he also had Baba as his number one position in recent quarters so welcome to the party Intel and US race to finalize 8.5 billion in chips funding by Year&#39;s End uh that is going to continue um uh and be a very positive thing for Intel moving forward um moving on China&#39;s poet burrow super supercharges stimulus with housing rate valves Etc so they did the rates they lowered the mortgage rates uh on trillions Yuan of mortgages they did the uh Bond issuance for a quarter trillion dollars of fiscal stimulus and it&#39;s just beginning they keep saying we&#39;ll do more we&#39;ll do more we&#39;ll do more and uh the market is\n\n### MACRO_DATA_SLIDES\nstruction going through the roof in

hedge funds snap up Chinese equities on stimulus optimism uh add to that after up 50% China&#39;s Yuan continues upward climb after Beijing stimulus rollout so all the late money that&#39;s come in will have to get punished a little bit U my guess is we push maybe a little bit higher and then bang them out 101 15% let them sell in the hole again and then just run it up uh parabolically probably into year end and uh and the first quarter hang sang and China internet outperforming the S&P year-to date that&#39;s funny China is now out performing the S&P year-to date pretty wild alibaba&#39;s AI powered cancer detection tool recognized on Fortune uh 2024 Change the World list uh is the Japanese Yen reversing upward the answer is yes ladies and gentlemen we&#39;ve been calling for that for months hedging goes out the door with burst of China stock Euphoria opinion follows Trend ladies and gentlemen uh there&#39;s David terer Central Bank comments exceeded expectations those calling Intel a company in Decline are missing the point entirely it&#39;s now a corporate actor on the geopolitical stage uh recent narrative coverage narrative uh the sad decline of a once- great American company continue to Outlook dim but the story is really a high stakes Thriller leading to an uncertain resolution that could carry Global implication may take years to play out but seeing the big picture takes each day&#39;s news far more interesting um they do the backstory inel today virgin story most interest okay the most interesting part the grand strategy great Powers geopolitics element semiconductors are crucial uh for both America&#39;s and China&#39;s national security only three companies can make leading extra chips Taiwan semiconductor Samsung and Intel which ranks in a distant third in output that&#39;s why bipartisan Congressional majorities in 2022 passed the chips and science acts which subsidizes new chip factories in America uh Gina romond in February explained why we cannot allow ourselves to be overly riant on one part of the world for the most important piece of Hardware in the 21st century [Music] um so effectively what this article is telling you is what I&#39;ve been saying for months which is oh by the way here&#39;s what&#39;s interesting uh quote I fully expect that we&#39;ll need a chips act too so they&#39;re going to get more more money why because they&#39;re the only game in town so Taiwan semiconductor uh is is not the region they want to fund Samsung is not the region they fund Intel is the only one that can produce these and they&#39;ve actually just started delivering their gouty 3 chip uh which we&#39;ve covered many times and the government will continue to stand behind them because it&#39;s a ma matter of National Security top shell boss says us unusually vulnerable to Middle East oil shock I think the the stage is set with everyone so pessimistic they all wanted energy stocks at the top no one wanted them at the bottom in 2020 when we were buying everyone wanted them at the top in 2023 uh and now they&#39;re pessimistic again I think that creates opportunity Chinese home buyers Scout showrooms after midnight at midnight after easing so the minute the policy stepped in the Chinese are back to what they love to do which is by real estate and uh and the game is back on and it was just a question of how long it took them to cry uncle they took about 12 months more than we anticipated but it forced us to buy a ton more stock at lower prices so the Christmas card is in the mail to xiin Ping Boeing stock Rose despite effort saying a uh a share offering is coming so they got to raise about 10 billion of equity somewhat deluded probably already priced in uh but once they turn the spets back on and the cash flow goes they&#39;ll just buy that stock in uh and what that does is it saves their credit rating and gives them a little bit more leverage because at the end of the day with all these strikes as strong as they are and as as organized as they are at the end of the day workers run out of money and they blink and uh you know I don&#39;t mean to sound callous I&#39;m telling you how this works out the company can raise 10 billion doar the workers can&#39;t and um so sooner or later they&#39;re going to come to a reasonable solution I mean I think what&#39;s on the table with Boeing was up 30% in Pay what&#39;s on you know the the uh long shoremen are already making $150,000 a year to load packages interesting enough if you go to China all of these ports are completely automated they have these automated elevators that take the cargo container off the ship it goes on a truck that has an autonomous driver that takes the stuff where it needs to go I mean you can&#39;t make this stuff up so you know no one likes change we all have to deal with it um I think that Boeing will come to a reasonable solution like the UAW and the car makers did but um eventually these things get resolved because people have their rent doesn&#39;t stop coming in their cell phone bill doesn&#39;t stop coming in their car payment doesn&#39;t stop coming in and usually it&#39;s about at a month of savings that most of the workers have and then everyone blinks and wants to vote so that&#39;s where it comes they&#39;ll get more they should get more prices have gone up but like some of the requests uh on both sides you know they get everyone starts with a big ask and then they come to a deal that neither party likes and that&#39;s the sign of a good deal when no one&#39;s happy the workers won&#39;t be perfectly happy the company won&#39;t be work perfectly happy they&#39;ll have given more money than they wanted to the workers have will have gotten uh probably slightly less than they wanted to and everyone goes home and and uh everything gets back to normal China retail investors scramble back to the stock market I don&#39;t want to miss the boat there you go that&#39;s

now the stock is going down stock is 20 uh okay so let&#39;s see what&#39;s happening with human we haven&#39;t done anything with this yet we&#39;re not in a rush to do anything we&#39;ve got a lot of companies that we love uh what is going on here all right well it&#39;s more on our radar now than it was the when when we uh talked about it a week or so ago uh yeah there was something about the ah what the heck was it it was something about the uh reimbursements that they&#39;re going to get hit for a few billion dollars or something like that I think was the news 2025 membership for its top rated Medicare plan Medicare star ratings okay so I&#39;ll look into that that probably creates an opportunity let me put that down next to oil services materials and human not doing anything on that yet no real change I mean we just look at the fundamentals on this call that&#39;s like 1% of the work then you got to really dig into the business and we haven&#39;t done that yet because we we simply don&#39;t have a place for it yet so uh we&#39;re happy with our current holding Tim felmingham we&#39;re you know we get I&#39;ve covered this a million times but let me emphasize for the new

positives what needs to happen for Intel become a buy now there is  no buy now think you&#39;re going to get the perfect day or the perfect week you&#39;re out of your mind you don&#39;t get multi-baggers that way you get multi-baggers because you apply a framework you look at solvency risk you know we&#39;re looking at the the guarantee the implicit government guarantee and um you know they&#39;re going to ship the gouty 3 people are going to see how incredible it is the lunar lake is going the 18a they&#39;ll get the8 billion from the chips sa all these things will start to click but you&#39;re not going to pick the buy now you&#39;re going to buy some at 23 you&#39;re going to buy some at maybe at 17 you&#39;re going to buy some at 25 maybe uh and then you know two three four years out it&#39;s $40 50 $60 and if they actually start producing these uh competitive chips the gpus versus the CPUs of their legacy business which is worth 40 to 50 bucks uh then you can have a hundred bucks but uh we don&#39;t know yet they&#39;ve got to deliver but in the meantime you know we look at our downsides pretty much protected if they liquidated the company today uh You&#39; probably get back you know full 20 25 bucks it&#39;s trading below tangible book uh oh and by the way their company doing 50 some OD billion dollars of Revenue that the US government is dependent on uh for geopolitical uh strategic uh safety uh so the last time you had a company that was fully backstopped by the government it was called Tesla because they were so intent on on pushing these EVs and Tesla was subsidized billions upon billions of dollar and created one of the greatest companies in the world I think Intel has the opportunity to take advantage of that single-minded because people can&#39;t just set up a Fab I mean Intel is so far ahead of what anyone else could do so as much as everyone wants to buy the arms and the nvidias and the um um Le amds and all that stuff they are the designer they are so dependent on the ability of tsmc Samsung or Intel to produce their stuff they can design all day long if they can&#39;t produce they&#39;re worthless so for me that puts uh and Intel is the only game in town so effectively what&#39;s setting up with Intel is a monopoly uh government-backed Monopoly which are the greatest kinds of Monopoly which is effectively what happened with Tesla uh during its run and um so uh so tell me how you really feel about Intel Tom all right\n\nlunar lake is going the 18a they&#39;ll get the8 billion from the chips sa all these things will start to click but you&#39;re not going to pick the buy now you&#39;re going to buy some at 23 you&#39;re going to buy some at maybe at 17 you&#39;re going to buy some at 25 maybe uh and

are fine but it&#39;s like you know it&#39;s a literal cigar butt you know uh Ben Graham and Warren Buffett talked about cigar butts that&#39;s a cigar butt it&#39;s a declining business but they buy back stock they generate a ton of free cash flow from all the people that are addicted and it&#39;ll continue for some time and they&#39;ll buy some more uh addictive businesses like vaping and all the other stuff that&#39;s bad for people and they&#39;ll continue to pay the dividend but you know it look if it was cheaper I would buy it but I I don&#39;t really love uh that stuff Lou R Rue Reynolds love the show recommended to all my friends thank you very much and for all of you that have been listening in and getting tremendous value uh the number one compliment you can pay me is to share it with one friend or more who loves the markets and help them out as well um does Cooper standard have big risk exposure to the Port strike which started October 1st or do revenues just keep getting booked and customers get their orders later uh there&#39;s risk there&#39;s obviously risk 28% of goods go through there however um their risk is not as big as 90% of the other companies that have the risk and uh you have to make bets on um kind of game theory and and I would assume that if this goes for more than a week and a half or two Biden is going to have to step in or they&#39;re going to lose the election and um now Biden may say listen these guys push me out against my will uh payback&#39;s a I mean there&#39;s something to be said for that but I doubt the powers that be will allow that to happen and therefore I would bet on the obvious which is it either gets resolved or more likely he can save face and say look uh this is holiday season we have to get the goods in for Christmas therefore I&#39;m going to Institute Taft heartley just until November to get maybe November 6th or thereabouts just to get enough Goods in for Christmas so all the little boys and girls can be happy with their gifts and then they can go back to fighting November 6 right after the election um all right hi Tom Ronan bitten from Israel big fan hey Ronan look uh sorry to hear about everything that&#39;s going on over there I hope you&#39;re staying safe um would like your opinion on a thank you a is Alexandria real estate Equity ah I don&#39;t ah yeah I&#39;m not really in love yes I like okay so we did the Vornado quick double last year vado&#39;s now back it&#39;s going I&#39;m not in love with multif family because there&#39;s so much new Supply on the market and coming on the market and starts um let me just look at their balance sheet I think this one&#39;s going to be okay but um balance sheet financial analysis balance sheet 61 debt is 12 billion cash is half a billion but secured by property what&#39;s the asset value 33 billion uh 33 billion or 38 is gross let&#39;s see all right let&#39;s look at this yeah this one&#39;s probably all right um I have to do a lot more work but it certainly warrants doing more work um my general view is there&#39;s going to be a counter Trend move in these rats and utilities so maybe rates back up a little bit for the short term and that&#39;ll be your opportunity to buy very small yield for what it is though 4.4 and you&#39;re not really going to get yeah I I think it&#39;s okay see if we get a little yield backup uh see if you when you get a correction in utilities this would be a time to buy this um but it looks not bad I just um not for me uh Kyle M first off you mentioned during your vfc Deep dive podcast you rarely hear from folks oh you rarely hear from folks about calls that go right and usually only hear the ones that haven&#39;t uh started moving yet uh thanks for the education on Baba and congrats on the call uh okay so he&#39;s asking about Advanced Auto Parts Advanced Auto Parts fine they risk the problem is is what&#39;s the eida moving forward and they&#39;re doing we went we did a deep dive on that like a month ago nothing&#39;s really changed he&#39;s asking if I&#39;ve added we have added at the margins but not like Baba added uh When Baba was down this has never been a core position this has been a good size position but not huge uh but we&#39;re comfortable with it here maybe we maybe we&#39;ll add a few more shares there&#39;s just no Catalyst until the next earnings call because they already told you that uh they&#39;re going to be weak this quarter so it&#39;s just going to languish until it\n\num my general view is there&#39;s going to be a counter Trend move

that haven&#39;t uh started moving yet uh thanks for the education on Baba and congrats on the call uh okay so he&#39;s asking about Advanced Auto Parts Advanced Auto Parts fine they risk the problem

we&#39;ll add a few more shares there&#39;s just no Catalyst until the next earnings call because they already told you that uh they&#39;re going to be weak this quarter so it&#39;s just going to languish until it finally  takes off and people realize the significance of the sale and the deleverage and the impact of cash flow and the turnaround so it&#39;ll just hang there but uh no change other than he&#39;s executing exactly what he promised he would and we&#39;re we&#39;re comfortable with that um that&#39;s Shane o Kelly who ran HD Supply for Home Depot 7 billion doll business that was a beast and still is uh I wanted to ask you about WBA this is from Jan Jan I cover this every week it&#39;s not for me until they take the locks off the doors and they do some type of criminal reform where if you steal something from a store you actually go to jail I&#39;m not really interested this is a complete they&#39;re going to figure it out there&#39;s an enormous amount of value and there&#39;s only two players left but um they&#39;re just they&#39;re just hiring better uses um so all that would be is just a trade you&#39;re looking for a double bounce off the bottom and uh it&#39;s not what I do Yuki Nish Nisha I mean here&#39;s how I think about it by the way it&#39;s very simple this is the way you should go into every company if JP Morgan was going to finance me to to take private the entire Walgreens boot boots allons they would give me a credit line uh for whatever it&#39;s worth now tens of billions of dollars uh and I had to be the equity and put up 90% of my net worth to take the company private with JP Morgan&#39;s financing would I put 90% of my net worth up to buy Walgreens boots Alliance at these discounted levels and the answer is no therefore I&#39;m not going to play it for a double trade off the bottom um thanks for the great lessons you teach um all right so he&#39;s asking what this is from Yuki and Japan what has to happen for Advanced Auto Parts to get the same multiple as AutoZone and all that stuff it&#39;s going to take time but um I don&#39;t know if they&#39;ll ever get that multiple but they don&#39;t need to for it to be you know a double triple plus um it&#39;s just going to take a few years Jimbo Jones uh could you review valet okay I keep looking at valet and I keep passing and I keep wondering why I keep passing let me just see because this is a materials play I think you&#39;ll be okay here I just think that there are better plays in this base and um yeah I mean I think these cash I think the cash flow on revenues are going to pick back up but that&#39;s why the stock is down so it&#39;s not a big surprise I just think it&#39;s milk toast it it&#39;s not like I can&#39;t see myself getting a multibagger here so why even why even tie up the capital uh ocidental petroleum because they&#39;re doing carbon capture this is from Eric I I don&#39;t oxy is not going to move because they&#39;re doing car carbon capture I have no interest I don&#39;t think the integrated have come down enough for me to be interested and everyone keeps getting faked out because uh Buffett keeps buying it the problem is what they don&#39;t realize is Buffett is exercising warrants that he got here in 2019 look it up he did a debt financing and got a ton of free warrants at $59 so he&#39;s exercising those warrants he&#39;s not buying new stock uh as everyone thinks he is so for me you know the time to buy it was in 2020 when we were buying Exxon Mobile hand over fist in the hole now that it&#39;s up eight bagger everyone can you know oh no it&#39;s it&#39;s not for me because it&#39;s not going to double from here over I mean it might double from here but it&#39;s like Comstock could be a multibagger uh in my view and that&#39;s where I want to take risk in the space and I think some of the servicers are getting uh to the point where they could be um at least doubles or triples what amazing week in China this is from um Sagar uh kanakia thanks seagar I know you&#39;ve been listening for a long time uh so he&#39;s asking about Stanis the answer is no they keep asking me about the car makers I don&#39;t want to be in the car maker business because effectively all all they are is annuity companies and health insurance companies that happen to make automobiles they&#39;re controlled by the unions their margins are going to go down they&#39;re going to be forced to produce more cars it&#39;s going to be a race to the bottom and we are going to benefit from that race to the bottom because we are the Arms Dealer with Cooper standard so not interested in that am interested in higher volumes as they race to the bottom and we will take advantage could you please take a look at coals no interest in Coals that thing has been dead money for a while and I think will continue to be amazing past week for China okay we covered that it&#39;s amazing how exciting everyone is now by the way good stuff on Baba thanks Kayla human has taken a precipitous drop yeah I&#39;m looking at it uh not doing anything with it yet uh Boeing management potentially diluting shares a concern no that&#39;s a positive because they keep their investment rating they get more staying power against the unions they&#39;ll negotiate a better deal turn the spets back Lo back on deal with their backlog start to generate cash flow and buy back the stock Damian Langer oh sorry okay so\n\nfor me you know the time to buy it was in 2020 when we were buying Exxon Mobile hand over fist in the

to try to keep this one under an hour these things have been going two hours every week because we&#39;ve had so much to talk about what but when everything&#39;s working and you have a record uh uh unbelievable situation going on there&#39;s not a whole lot to talk about as I as I always like to say we spend 80% of the time talking about the ones that haven&#39;t moved yet and uh you know five or 10% celebrating our winners so uh for everyone listening in China&#39;s working we don&#39;t have to spend a lot of time on that\n\n### MISCELLANEOUS\nwe&#39;re going to try to keep this one under an hour these things have been going two hours every week because we&#39;ve had so much to talk about what but when everything&#39;s working and you have a record uh uh unbelievable situation going on there&#39;s not a whole lot to talk about as I as I always like to say we spend 80% of the time talking about the ones that haven&#39;t moved yet and uh you know five or 10% celebrating our winners so uh for everyone listening in China&#39;s working we don&#39;t have to spend a lot of time on that\n\nthis is a photo with Walt Disney uh his statue when we just got in and there&#39;s a quote here you can enlarge it says uh it&#39;s from Disney himself quote we&#39;re just getting started and it&#39;s so appropo for what is happening with China\n\n### MISCELLANEOUS\nthat suggests to me another group of costara in the blooming that could power this thing for decades to come the fact that it&#39;s down today is purely a technical move and an opportunity Tom&#39;s going to steal cost karate so you guys will be you guys will be even here U what&#39;s your counter to that Tom I mean how do you feel about the US economy we do obviously see that inflation is moderating continuing to moderate although the Core year-over-year pce 2 .7 while it matched it&#39;s still hotter than a year ago it it it&#39;s Goldilocks I mean things look good the only thing I&#39;m a little worried about by the way whenever Keith talks I listen Keith is a good buddy of mine so take a look at those names um the skew option skew is the cost to ensure one and two standard deviation d uh uh Corrections is at 10year highs so it doesn&#39;t mean you&#39;re automatically going to get a correction but you know pre-election volatility is pretty typical going back to 1955 in the in the month of October so we are staying fully invested but if you&#39;re on margin I would get off margin we&#39;re going to write out these bumps and then once the election clears we&#39;ll get a yearend rally okay a yearend rally I&#39;m wondering if that would include Keith Intel Intel of course has been at the center of individual stock\n\n### HEADLINES_AND_NEWS\nthis week and at the end of last week Bloomberg&#39;s got a report the Wall Street journal&#39;s got a report that you know private Equity might come in and maybe Qualcomm maybe who knows what arm but but one thing that&#39;s been reported is that Intel&#39;s pretty much rebuffed a lot of this you know I got to tell you Pat gelsinger I&#39;ve met him several times is as bright as they come he&#39;s the right guy at the right time for that company the problem why I mean he&#39;s lagging here he&#39;s been at the helm for a couple of years so I think unfortunately Intel remains dead money I don&#39;t know why they rebuffed these offers because that could have been salvation it seems to me that there&#39;s a lot of blunt thinking inside their headquarters right now and it&#39;s going to be bad for shareholders okay well at least for the week I see Intel up about 88.7%\n\n### HEADLINES_AND_NEWS\nTom said listen to Keith&#39;s picks and I will tell you that had our viewers listened to you a couple of years ago about one particular stock stay in it stay in it stay in it they would have made a lot of money and that is Palante teer and we look at some of the gains here uh it&#39;s it&#39;s quite unbelievable hitting brand new records uh not unbelievable because you&#39;ve been here telling us about that where does the stock go you&#39;re you&#39;re very kind to remember that thank you I think we&#39;re going to take out 50 pretty quickly I&#39;m starting to think about 85 but three to five years from now there&#39;s zero doubt in my mind we&#39;re looking at a hundred bucks a share so it&#39;s going to be volatile going to be a tough stock to own but I encourage people to stay with it if you can yeah big Daya aggregator great to see you both have a good weekend gentlemen\n\n### HEADLINES_AND_NEWS\nplease pull up the DOW Industrials the smmp and the NASDAQ please they&#39;re they&#39;re moving south that is because the US has indications that Iran is preparing to launch a ballistic missile attack against Israel that would be a very very serious development in international relations an extension of the war and we&#39;d like to know what our response what America&#39;s response would be if this happened I think that&#39;s Weighing on the market now let&#39;s get back to the dock strike uh 45,000 workers on strike Tom Hayes joins me uh to watch the market for us do you expect Biden to intervene within a week as I&#39;m I&#39;m suggesting that in my opinion piece there what do you say I absolutely agree with you you Ste I think Biden&#39;s going to intervene he just doesn&#39;t know it yet because effectively the last thing you want to see going into an election is 401ks going down and the cost of eggs and wood and all the supplies to North Carolina going up this could be if they fumble the ball the best thing that ever happened to Donald Trump in terms of the election because uh right now we front-loaded a lot of shipping into the East Coast so for the next week it&#39;s only going to cost $34 billion after the first week it could start to cost $4 billion a day people are going to feel that and we&#39;re in a seasonally weak period of the stock market as a matter of fact in elections the next 10 days election years since 1955 are the most volatile and the lowest returns of the year of an election year so you compound that with Israel Iran you compound that with the strike I think he comes in in a week and a half and say if it&#39;s not resolved beforehand and says we&#39;re going to let this cool down to I don&#39;t know sometime in November well thank you right right but so you are telling me that if the strike lasts you know two weeks say the market will take a hit regardless of what President Biden does no question about it yeah I think the Market&#39;s going to start to extrapolate what that means uh in terms of you know 50% of the port shutting down can&#39;t get Goods Walmart&#39;s going to be hit Home Depot&#39;s going to be hit uh and then people will worry about the holidays as well so uh certainly the Public Public will even though a lot of the holiday supply has come in by the end of September uh as things run out as Price look consumer confidence it&#39;s been kind of dead on the mat why because prices are up so prices start to tick up again uh and they associate that with the Harris Biden Administration uh it&#39;s really going to bode well for Trump going into the election I want to get back to this breaking story the US has indications that Iran is preparing to launch a ballistic missile attack against Israel I&#39;m saying that that is part of the reason for the Market&#39;s decline we&#39;re down 3 30 now on the DOW Industrials is it a is it a big negative for the overall Market I think so we had indications of this headline uh midn next mid last week and we saw this type of volatility mid last week uh this is a factor and you have to think about see that on the screen right now uh the yield on the 10-year treasury is down that is the result of a flight to safety that&#39;s people putting money into dead safe 10year Treasures is that 10 yes it is the 10 year forcing the price up and the yield down right to safety that&#39;s my opinion vix is up oil is up 3% oil is at $70 a barrel I think on this breaking store it&#39;s happening as we speak it&#39;s interesting uh that last time I was on I said if you&#39;re on margin come off margin and the reason I said that is the skew which is the price to ensure against a one standard deviation correction think of 10% correction hit 10year highs in the last week that doesn&#39;t guarantee a correction but it indicates that uh we&#39;re fully invested but we&#39;re off of margin we we&#39;ll write out these short-term bumps through the election I think we we&#39;ll do fine after the election but you have to keep that in mind uh we made a lot of money don&#39;t borrow money to buy stocks it&#39;s not a good not right now\n\n### QUOTES_OF_THE_WEEK\nto buy when others are despondently selling and sell when others are euphorically buying takes the greatest courage but provides the greatest profit I can&#39;t tell you how many of you uh came to me and um have have uh expressed your gratitude for hanging in there and buying in the hole when no one was and we were buying every single week it was red and now you guys have made a ton of money\n\n### FEATURED_COMPANY_DEEP_DIVES\nas great and most incredible as things are rocking and rolling uh just want to keep in mind that uh we&#39;re just getting started as Walt Disney would say cuz most of our great picks are just now beginning to leave the station you know Baba as much as it&#39;s moved 70% off the lows in a handful of minutes uh you know this will consolidate and this will work higher there&#39;s no question about it uh Baxter same thing it&#39;s moved a lot from 32 to 40 but again just getting started this thing&#39;s going to work higher over the next few years with the turnaround plan two billion dollars of cost out of the business um $13 reducing cost they did they did what they said they were going to do as far as selling deleveraging doing all the plans CPS we just got great Auto Sales in September up from 151 run rate in August to 157 in September and that&#39;s before the cuts and incentives even start into year end so very excited about that my goodness it would have been the best quarter of ever uh it might have been but uh might have been the best quarter of ever um uh if you had CPS also but I think CPS is going to be the fourth quarter story which we&#39;re very excited about Disney I can&#39;t tell you how crowded the parks were and how amazing the experience was nothing to think about there they&#39;re raising the prices at uh Disney plus people have to have Disney if they have children if they don&#39;t Social Services comes in and takes your children away that thing is Off to the Races gener same story sad story for the people in Florida I hope everyone is doing well um uh managing through it but this demand is going to continue to increase and increase with the unstable grid and electricity demand Intel opportunity of a lifetime we bought in the High Teens as it flushed out we&#39;ll probably buy some more if it goes back and retests small caps just working their way higher I think this is again a fourth quarter story after the election like it usually is November December favors small caps and that&#39;s when we break to new highs which is pretty exciting as you know we got rid of the big Banks over the summer took profits uh but we kept our regionals this is going to work higher with small caps over time and to new highs we&#39;re excited about that PayPal rocketing off the bottom from 50 to 80 however it&#39;s just getting started ladies and gentlemen yes it&#39;s a huge move and yes it&#39;ll consolidate and yes it will work higher this is a huge position for us as well as Baba uh Stanley black and&amp; deck are breaking out here from this consolidation range it&#39;ll consolidate and work higher to new highs over the next few years this is the most exciting time ever to be involved in markets and picking stocks because this once in a 100 year uh situation with Co created the most incredible amazing opportunity that&#39;s slipping away from us by the way if you don&#39;t get new money in uh you know in the next couple of quarters uh you can still do well but but the wholesale opportunities that are still out there yes they&#39;re moving up and yes we are uh super excited about that but we want everyone on the train with us to take full advantage and um uh it&#39;s it&#39;s unbelievable because you know in the case of Baba it&#39;s like yeah yo so you bring your basis all the way down to the low 80s and then you know boom it shoots up to 115 but the options we had it&#39;s it&#39;s staggering what&#39;s happening with some of these four five 6X 7x and taking a little bit of uh WIS on those that expire in January it&#39;s unbelievable and um and VF Corp VF little little old VF Corp is now knocking on the door 20 we haven&#39;t even had a time to talk about it it&#39;s up from 10 to 20 and no one is even paying attention to it I love this stuff uh biotech also starting to break out I mean it&#39;s been all of this stuff and remember we kept saying wait till the FED Cuts wait till the fed well it&#39;s here ladies and gentlemen small caps China biotech small capat the the whole thing is playing out according to plan\n\n### MACRO_DATA_SLIDES\nlet&#39;s talk about some of the data for the week consecutive weekly declines in US 30-year mortgage rate uh eight weekly declines this is going to continue I think we&#39;ll see a it went from 7.2 to 6.12 I think we will see a high five handle maybe by the end of the year certainly by first quarter and that&#39;s going to ignite the housing market which will benefit uh further benefit Stanley Black and&amp; Decker further benefit um JRA and others gaval put this out over the last two decades China has had five big Equity rallies three of which have been fueled by stimulus we could be at the beginning of a fourth stimulus rally which raises expectations of 50 to 100% gains it&#39;s so interesting to see all the groups that were excessively negative on China and bearish now that they&#39;re up you know 50 70% a lot of these stocks off the bottom in a matter of weeks uh they&#39;re all saying uh they&#39;re excited and just getting started and uh so they were telling people to sell 50% ago and now they&#39;re telling them to buy which means we probably consolidate at some point in the next few weeks and then um uh punish all the ones chasing at you know 120 130 and um uh and then they&#39;ll sell back at 110 and and and um and then it&#39;ll take up take back off to 150 so we covered that last week uh HSI shares has triggered its strongest breath advance in history a classic bull market initiation signal so that&#39;s good news the cost of bearish bets slumps as China stocks rally Global monetary easing September saw the biggest month of easing since April of 2020 this is something we&#39;ve been talking about for months that&#39;s playing out if you did you want to be a buyer or seller uh when this type of easing happened in the first quarter of 2020 you wanted to be a buyer and we were go back to the podcast tapes we were one of the few and it was one of the biggest most incredible years ever uh and then um uh 2009 same story so that that&#39;s that this is shows the seasonality of the first 10 days of October in an election presidential election year from 1928 this is the most volatile um a negative uh period of the Year doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;ll uh necessarily repeat but uh it&#39;s nice that uh we we built up some cash we sold Centum in the last couple of weeks we sold um and we took a lot of uh profits across a slew of options that were up four five 6 7x spreads Etc and um and uh and then after the first 10 days you move into a more favorable period and then following the election straight up that&#39;s a positive thing\n\n### MISCELLANEOUS\nokay so this is talking about if the market does well from July through October then the existing party stays in power if it does poorly the new party gets in power that makes sense we&#39;ll see how it plays out this time there&#39;s this consumer conf confidence factor and as I said on vanney if they fumble the strike and and stock prices 401K start to go down and prices start to go up uh that could change the whole Dynamics if they get to it quickly you know it&#39;s it&#39;s probably um we&#39;ll we&#39;ll see how it plays out but uh I think as it stands the Republicans will get the Senate the Democrats probably get the house and the presidency is a coin flip based on what happens in the next few weeks weeks uh economic surprise Index this is turning up that&#39;s what you see in expansions not contractions median floor area decreased remember we&#39;ve been covering this for three years we said not every starter home needs to be 5,000 square foot with an indoor pool uh that you know people can actually have a th000 and 2,000 square foot homes and like they did in um I think levit town in the 50s that&#39;s starting to play out that&#39;s going to allow a lot more people into the starter home land which is a good thing uh long dated US Treasury returns near 62- we lows so we&#39;ve had that huge rally off the bottom I think that&#39;s going to consolidate for a while um uh us large cap 10year rolling returns well above historical average I think that&#39;s overdone a little bit give small caps a chance give Emerging Markets Emerging Markets outperform developed which we covered on Liz uh small small greater than large um small greater than large Emerging Markets greater than developed markets value over growth unmagnify over Consumer Staples that&#39;s those are the themes going forward China msci earnings per share um trading at uh forward p ps is 6.5 times it&#39;s unbelievable and uh this is uh just showing at the bottom of the range msci profit margins are going up in the last two years not down this is msci China by the way this is all from yardeni uh valuation multiple again High single digit still even after this rally which is super exciting\n\nhere is a list of draw downs from Wisdom Tree Russell still trading below we like Russ small caps Russell 2000 and Emerging Markets these are your two big money opportunities ladies and gentlemen for the next 18 months that&#39;s going to continue I love I can&#39;t stop posting this chart uh with China short China equities was one of the most crowded trades for the last few months uh that they can&#39;t even get out of their shorts it&#39;s I mean could you imagine these guys are upside down 100% in a matter of weeks you&#39;re going to see a lot of them blow up the people that have been short and and um and that&#39;s the story Emerging Markets versus developed markets performance you can see it here hockey stick straight up cyclicals versus defensive starting to pick up now uh everyone crowded into defensives ahead of the cut we covered the economic surprise index here&#39;s the composition of S&P Equity capitalization you can see Tech at 32% but they&#39;re only 21% of the earnings so that&#39;s why we say large cap underperforms or magnificent 7even underperforms un magnificent 493 you can see sector by sector I think uh an interesting story here would be uh financials at 21% of the earnings and 133% of the weight so that uh speaks to the small cap uh that speaks to the um uh um Regional Bank index that we we still hold\n\nfinally recovering in 2024 and of course earnings growth still projected 15% Plus for next year the seasonality after the first 10 days of October turns positive uh etc etc earnings uh for the consumer staples top 30 weights in the last 30 days were revised down by 2.82% so we got to see Staples well there you go everyone wanted Staples and earnings are going down so that&#39;ll probably as for discretionary they were revised down less negative 1.37 uh let&#39;s see where that concentration is looks like Amazon okay well we took profits on that in the summer uh Tesla so the mag 7 is what&#39;s getting hit there and now uh economic calendar let&#39;s just cover any major things that happened this week we already covered the jolts uh we covered uh total vehicle sales were were 15.1 last print uh expected to be 15.6 for this month in September actually came in at 15.8 151 to 158 this is unbelievable this is before the impact of cuts this is before the impact of end of year incentives we&#39;re super excited um all right uh let&#39;s go to the\n\nuh David Martin uh inmd they do uh okay let's take a look at inmd I think it's medical device is all right this is a broken stock let's see if they're generating any cash they are generating a lot of cash uh margins are holding in uh financial analysis let's see here all right so the only thing we have to do with a company like this is figure out uh what's the bare thesis because this looks good so it's going right underneath my oil services research my materials research my human and my inmd so I want to understand this there might be a comp competitive threat but this is definitely worth uh exploring so good job on that David Martin all right um Paul found cone I think oh by the way Paul says uh two more weeks and you'll hit the fiveyear mark for your podcast pretty incredible pretty awesome been great to watch you and protect your craft over the last few years thanks Paul uh pzza I don't know if we covered this or not I've never liked it since the the founder uh got kicked out but um I can see let me just see if they're doing okay with revenues and cash flow I think this is going to work because this is going to fall in the discretionary bucket and I've wanted to find some restaurants now that everyone hates them uh looks like cash flow is kind of okay gross margins okay yeah this one definitely deserves a look so uh good find Paul and just make sure here txt this is from JT um I think that's Textron yeah okay uh now for me I don't buy things that are up 5x uh in a in three years that someone else already took the juice out of that trade so I'm going to pass fundamentals are okay cash flows declining stock pric is going up revenues are flat um pass so",

    "HEADLINES_AND_NEWS": "\n\nhere is another group of costara in the blooming that could power this thing for decades to come the fact that it&#39;s down today is purely a technical move and an opportunity Tom&#39;s going to steal cost karate so you guys will be you guys will be even here U what&#39;s your counter to that Tom I mean how do you feel about the US economy we do obviously see that inflation is moderating continuing to moderate although the Core year-over-year pce 2 .7 while it matched it&#39;s still hotter than a year ago it it it&#39;s Goldilocks I mean things look good the only thing I&#39;m a little worried about by the way whenever Keith talks I listen Keith is a good buddy of mine so take a look at those names um the skew option skew is the cost to ensure one and two standard deviation d uh uh Corrections is at 10year highs so it doesn&#39;t mean you&#39;re automatically going to get a correction but you know pre-election volatility is pretty typical going back to 1955 in the in the month of October so we are staying fully invested but if you&#39;re on margin I would get off margin we&#39;re going to write out these bumps and then once the election clears we&#39;ll get a yearend rally okay a yearend rally I&#39;m wondering if that would include Keith Intel ### HEADLINES_AND_NEWS\nIntel of course has been at the center of individual stock headlines\n\n### HEADLINES_AND_NEWS\n\n### HEADLINES_AND_NEWS\nthis week and at the end of last week Bloomberg&#39;s got a report the Wall Street journal&#39;s got a report that you know private Equity might come in and maybe Qualcomm maybe who knows what arm but but one thing that&#39;s been reported is that Intel&#39;s pretty much rebuffed a lot of this you know I got to tell you Pat gelsinger I&#39;ve met him several times is as bright as they come he&#39;s the right guy at the right time for that company the problem why I mean he&#39;s lagging here he&#39;s been at the helm for a couple of years so I think unfortunately Intel remains dead money I don&#39;t know why they rebuffed these offers because that could have been salvation it seems to me that there&#39;s a lot of blunt thinking inside their headquarters right now and it&#39;s going to be bad for shareholders okay well at least for the week I see Intel up about 88.7%\n\n### HEADLINES_AND_NEWS\nTom said listen to Keith&#39;s picks and I will tell you that had our viewers listened to you a couple of years ago about one particular stock stay in it stay in it stay in it they would have made a lot of money and that is Palante teer and we look at some of the gains here uh it&#39;s it&#39;s quite unbelievable hitting brand new records uh not unbelievable because you&#39;ve been here telling us about that where does the stock go you&#39;re you&#39;re very kind to remember that thank you I think we&#39;re going to take out 50 pretty quickly I&#39;m starting to think about 85 but three to five years from now there&#39;s zero doubt in my mind we&#39;re looking at a hundred bucks a share so it&#39;s going to be volatile going to be a tough stock to own but I encourage people to stay with it if you can yeah big Daya aggregator great to see you both have a good weekend gentlemen\n\n### HEADLINES_AND_NEWS\nplease pull up the DOW Industrials the smmp and the NASDAQ please they&#39;re they&#39;re moving south that is because the US has indications that Iran is preparing to launch a ballistic missile attack against Israel that would be a very very serious development in international relations an extension of the war and we&#39;d like to know what our response what America&#39;s response would be if this happened I think that&#39;s Weighing on the market now let&#39;s get back to the dock strike uh 45,000 workers on strike Tom Hayes joins me uh to watch the market for us do you expect Biden to intervene within a week as I&#39;m I&#39;m suggesting that in my opinion piece there what do you say I absolutely agree with you you Ste I think Biden&#39;s going to intervene he just doesn&#39;t know it yet because effectively the last thing you want to see going into an election is 401ks going down and the cost of eggs and wood and all the supplies to North Carolina going up this could be if they fumble the ball the best thing that ever happened to Donald Trump in terms of the election because uh right now we front-loaded a lot of shipping into the East Coast so for the next week it&#39;s only going to cost $34 billion after the first week it could start to cost $4 billion a day people are going to feel that and we&#39;re in a seasonally weak period of the stock market as a matter of fact in elections the next 10 days election years since 1955 are the most volatile and the lowest returns of the year of an election year so you compound that with Israel Iran you compound that with the strike I think he comes in in a week and a half and say if it&#39;s not resolved beforehand and says we&#39;re going to let this cool down to I don&#39;t know sometime in November well thank you right right but so you are telling me that if the strike lasts you know two weeks say the market will take a hit regardless of what President Biden does no question about it yeah I think the Market&#39;s going to start to extrapolate what that means uh in terms of you know 50% of the port shutting down can&#39;t get Goods Walmart&#39;s going to be hit Home Depot&#39;s going to be hit uh and then people will worry about the holidays as well so uh certainly the Public Public will even though a lot of the holiday supply has come in by the end of September uh as things run out as Price look consumer confidence it&#39;s been kind of dead on the mat why because prices are up so prices start to tick up again uh and they associate that with the Harris Biden Administration uh it&#39;s really going to bode well for Trump going into the election I want to get back to this breaking story the US has indications that Iran is preparing to launch a ballistic missile attack against Israel I&#39;m saying that that is part of the reason for the Market&#39;s decline we&#39;re down 3 30 now on the DOW Industrials is it a is it a big negative for the overall Market I think so we had indications of this headline uh midn next mid last week and we saw this type of volatility mid last week uh this is a factor and you have to think about see that on the screen right now uh the yield on the 10-year treasury is down that is the result of a flight to safety that&#39;s people putting money into dead safe 10year Treasures is that 10 yes it is the 10 year forcing the price up and the yield down right to safety that&#39;s my opinion vix is up oil is up 3% oil is at $70 a barrel I think on this breaking store it&#39;s happening as we speak it&#39;s interesting uh that last time I was on I said if you&#39;re on margin come off margin and the reason I said that is the skew which is the price to ensure against a one standard deviation correction think of 10% correction hit 10year highs in the last week that doesn&#39;t guarantee a correction but it indicates that uh we&#39;re fully invested but we&#39;re off of margin we we&#39;ll write out these short-term bumps through the election I think we we&#39;ll do fine after the election but you have to keep that in mind uh we made a lot of money don&#39;t borrow money to buy stocks it&#39;s not a good not right now\n\n### QUOTES_OF_THE_WEEK\nto buy when others are despondently selling and sell when others are euphorically buying takes the greatest courage but provides the greatest profit I can&#39;t tell you how many of you uh came to me and um have have uh expressed your gratitude for hanging in there and buying in the hole when no one was and we were buying every single week it was red and now you guys have made a ton of money\n\n### FEATURED_COMPANY_DEEP_DIVES\nas great and most incredible as things are rocking and rolling uh just want to keep in mind that uh we&#39;re just getting started as Walt Disney would say cuz most of our great picks are just now beginning to leave the station you know Baba as much as it&#39;s moved 70% off the lows in a handful of minutes uh you know this will consolidate and this will work higher there&#39;s no question about it uh Baxter same thing it&#39;s moved a lot from 32 to 40 but again just getting started this thing&#39;s going to work higher over the next few years with the turnaround plan two billion dollars of cost out of the business um $13 reducing cost they did they did what they said they were going to do as far as selling deleveraging doing all the plans CPS we just got great Auto Sales in September up from 151 run rate in August to 157 in September and that&#39;s before the cuts and incentives even start into year end so very excited about that my goodness it would have been the best quarter of ever uh it might have been but uh might have been the best quarter of ever um uh if you had CPS also but I think CPS is going to be the fourth quarter story which we&#39;re very excited about Disney I can&#39;t tell you how crowded the parks were and how amazing the experience was nothing to think about there they&#39;re raising the prices at uh Disney plus people have to have Disney if they have children if they don&#39;t Social Services comes in and takes your children away that thing is Off to the Races gener same story sad story for the people in Florida I hope everyone is doing well um uh managing through it but this demand is going to continue to increase and increase with the unstable grid and electricity demand Intel opportunity of a lifetime we bought in the High Teens as it flushed out we&#39;ll probably buy some more if it goes back and retests small caps just working their way higher I think this is again a fourth quarter story after the election like it usually is November December favors small caps and that&#39;s when we break to new highs which is pretty exciting as you know we got rid of the big Banks over the summer took profits uh but we kept our regionals this is going to work higher with small caps over time and to new highs we&#39;re excited about that PayPal rocketing off the bottom from 50 to 80 however it&#39;s just getting started ladies and gentlemen yes it&#39;s a huge move and yes it&#39;ll consolidate and yes it will work higher this is a huge position for us as well as Baba uh Stanley black and&amp; deck are breaking out here from this consolidation range it&#39;ll consolidate and work higher to new highs over the next few years this is the most exciting time ever to be involved in markets and picking stocks because this once in a 100 year uh situation with Co created the most incredible amazing opportunity that&#39;s slipping away from us by the way if you don&#39;t get new money in uh you know in the next couple of quarters uh you can still do well but but the wholesale opportunities that are still out there yes they&#39;re moving up and yes we are uh super excited about that but we want everyone on the train with us to take full advantage and um uh it&#39;s it&#39;s unbelievable because you know in the case of Baba it&#39;s like yeah yo so you bring your basis all the way down to the low 80s and then you know boom it shoots up to 115 but the options we had it&#39;s it&#39;s staggering what&#39;s happening with some of these four five 6X 7x and taking a little bit of uh WIS on those that expire in January it&#39;s unbelievable and um and VF Corp VF little little old VF Corp is now knocking on the door 20 we haven&#39;t even had a time to talk about it it&#39;s up from 10 to 20 and no one is even paying attention to it I love this stuff uh biotech also starting to break out I mean it&#39;s been all of this stuff and remember we kept saying wait till the FED Cuts wait till the fed well it&#39;s here ladies and gentlemen small caps China biotech small capat the the whole thing is playing out according to plan\n\n### MACRO_DATA_SLIDES\nlet&#39;s talk about some of the data for the week consecutive weekly declines in US 30-year mortgage rate uh eight weekly declines this is going to continue I think we&#39;ll see a it went from 7.2 to 6.12 I think we will see a high five handle maybe by the end of the year certainly by first quarter and that&#39;s going to ignite the housing market which will benefit uh further benefit Stanley Black and&amp; Decker further benefit um JRA and others gaval put this out over the last two decades China has had five big Equity rallies three of which have been fueled by stimulus we could be at the beginning of a fourth stimulus rally which raises expectations of 50 to 100% gains it&#39;s so interesting to see all the groups that were excessively negative on China and bearish now that they&#39;re up you know 50 70% a lot of these stocks off the bottom in a matter of weeks uh they&#39;re all saying uh they&#39;re excited and just getting started and uh so they were telling people to sell 50% ago and now they&#39;re telling them to buy which means we probably consolidate at some point in the next few weeks and then um uh punish all the ones chasing at you know 120 130 and um uh and then they&#39;ll sell back at 110 and and and um and then it&#39;ll take up take back off to 150 so we covered that last week uh HSI shares has triggered its strongest breath advance in history a classic bull market initiation signal so that&#39;s good news the cost of bearish bets slumps as China stocks rally Global monetary easing September saw the biggest month of easing since April of 2020 this is something we&#39;ve been talking about for months that&#39;s playing out if you did you want to be a buyer or seller uh when this type of easing happened in the first quarter of 2020 you wanted to be a buyer and we were go back to the podcast tapes we were one of the few and it was one of the biggest most incredible years ever uh and then um uh 2009 same story so that that&#39;s that this is shows the seasonality of the first 10 days of October in an election presidential election year from 1928 this is the most volatile um a negative uh period of the Year doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;ll uh necessarily repeat but uh it&#39;s nice that uh we we built up some cash we sold Centum in the last couple of weeks we sold um and we took a lot of uh profits across a slew of options that were up four five 6 7x spreads Etc and um and uh and then after the first 10 days you move into a more favorable period and then following the election straight up that&#39;s a positive thing\n\n### MISCELLANEOUS\nokay so this is talking about if the market does well from July through October then the existing party stays in power if it does poorly the new party gets in power that makes sense we&#39;ll see how it plays out this time there&#39;s this consumer conf confidence factor and as I said on vanney if they fumble the strike and and stock prices 401K start to go down and prices start to go up uh that could change the whole Dynamics if they get to it quickly you know it&#39;s it&#39;s probably um we&#39;ll we&#39;ll see how it plays out but uh I think as it stands the Republicans will get the Senate the Democrats probably get the house and the presidency is a coin flip based on what happens in the next few weeks weeks uh economic surprise Index this is turning up that&#39;s what you see in expansions not contractions median floor area decreased remember we&#39;ve been covering this for three years we said not every starter home needs to be 5,000 square foot with an indoor pool uh that you know people can actually have a th000 and 2,000 square foot homes and like they did in um I think levit town in the 50s that&#39;s starting to play out that&#39;s going to allow a lot more people into the starter home land which is a good thing uh long dated US Treasury returns near 62- we lows so we&#39;ve had that huge rally off the bottom I think that&#39;s going to consolidate for a while um uh us large cap 10year rolling returns well above historical average I think that&#39;s overdone a little bit give small caps a chance give Emerging Markets Emerging Markets outperform developed which we covered on Liz uh small small greater than large um small greater than large Emerging Markets greater than developed markets value over growth unmagnify over Consumer Staples that&#39;s those are the themes going forward China msci earnings per share um trading at uh forward p ps is 6.5 times it&#39;s unbelievable and uh this is uh just showing at the bottom of the range msci profit margins are going up in the last two years not down this is msci China by the way this is all from yardeni uh valuation multiple again High single digit still even after this rally which is super exciting\n\nbelieving them because they are doing what they say they&#39;re going to do um next hedge funds snap up Chinese equities on stimulus optimism uh add to that after up 50% China&#39;s Yuan continues upward climb after Beijing stimulus rollout so all the late money that&#39;s come in will have to get punished a little bit U my guess is we push maybe a little bit higher and then bang them out 101 15% let them sell in the hole again and then just run it up uh parabolically probably into year end and uh and the first quarter hang sang and China internet outperforming the S&P year-to date that&#39;s funny China is now out performing the S&P year-to date pretty wild alibaba&#39;s AI powered cancer detection tool recognized on Fortune uh 2024 Change the World list uh is the Japanese Yen reversing upward the answer is yes ladies and gentlemen we&#39;ve been calling for that for months hedging goes out the door with burst of China stock Euphoria opinion follows Trend ladies and gentlemen uh there&#39;s David terer Central Bank comments exceeded expectations those calling Intel a company in Decline are missing the point entirely it&#39;s now a corporate actor on the geopolitical stage uh recent narrative coverage narrative uh the sad decline of a once- great American company continue to Outlook dim but the story is really a high stakes Thriller leading to an uncertain resolution that could carry Global implication may take years to play out but seeing the big picture takes each day&#39;s news far more interesting um they do the backstory inel today virgin story most interest okay the most interesting part the grand strategy great Powers geopolitics element semiconductors are crucial uh for both America&#39;s and China&#39;s national security only three companies can make leading extra chips Taiwan semiconductor Samsung and Intel which ranks in a distant third in output that&#39;s why bipartisan Congressional majorities in 2022 passed the chips and science acts which subsidizes new chip factories in America uh Gina romond in February explained why we cannot allow ourselves to be overly riant on one part of the world for the most important piece of Hardware in the 21st century [Music] um so effectively what this article is telling you is what I&#39;ve been saying for months which is oh by the way here&#39;s what&#39;s interesting uh quote I fully expect that we&#39;ll need a chips act too so they&#39;re going to get more more money why because they&#39;re the only game in town so Taiwan semiconductor uh is is not the region they want to fund Samsung is not the region they fund Intel is the only one that can produce these and they&#39;ve actually just started delivering their gouty 3 chip uh which we&#39;ve covered many times and the government will continue to stand behind them because it&#39;s a ma matter of National Security top shell boss says us unusually vulnerable to Middle East oil shock I think the the stage is set with everyone so pessimistic they all wanted energy stocks at the top no one wanted them at the bottom in 2020 when we were buying everyone wanted them at the top in 2023 uh and now they&#39;re pessimistic again I think that creates opportunity Chinese home buyers Scout showrooms after midnight at midnight after easing so the minute the policy stepped in the Chinese are back to what they love to do which is by real estate and uh and the game is back on and it was just a question of how long it took them to cry uncle they took about 12 months more than we anticipated but it forced us to buy a ton more stock at lower prices so the Christmas card is in the mail to xiin Ping Boeing stock Rose despite effort saying a uh a share offering is coming so they got to raise about 10 billion of equity somewhat deluded probably already priced in uh but once they turn the spets back on and the cash flow goes they&#39;ll just buy that stock in uh and what that does is it saves their credit rating and gives them a little bit more leverage because at the end of the day with all these strikes as strong as they are and as as organized as they are at the end of the day workers run out of money and they blink and uh you know I don&#39;t mean to sound callous I&#39;m telling you how this works out the company can raise 10 billion doar the workers can&#39;t and um so sooner or later they&#39;re going to come to a reasonable solution I mean I think what&#39;s on the table with Boeing was up 30% in Pay what&#39;s on you know the the uh long shoremen are already making $150,000 a year to load packages interesting enough if you go to China all of these ports are completely automated they have these automated elevators that take the cargo container off the ship it goes on a truck that has an autonomous driver that takes the stuff where it needs to go I mean you can&#39;t make this stuff up so you know no one likes change we all have to deal with it um I think that Boeing will come to a reasonable solution like the UAW and the car makers did but um eventually these things get resolved because people have their rent doesn&#39;t stop coming in their cell phone bill doesn&#39;t stop coming in their car payment doesn&#39;t stop coming in and usually it&#39;s about at a month of savings that most of the workers have and then everyone blinks and wants to vote so that&#39;s where it comes they&#39;ll get more they should get more prices have gone up but like some of the requests uh on both sides you know they get everyone starts with a big ask and then they come to a deal that neither party likes and that&#39;s the sign of a good deal when no one&#39;s happy the workers won&#39;t be perfectly happy the company won&#39;t be work perfectly happy they&#39;ll have given more money than they wanted to the workers have will have gotten uh probably slightly less than they wanted to and everyone goes home and and uh everything gets back to normal China retail investors scramble back to the stock market I don&#39;t want to miss the boat

October has been the worst month of election years worse than September and then um uh\nhere is  Ned Davis the cycle composite for the election year 2024 you see here beginning of October gets weak all the way to the last week of October mid-mon Spike and then you get the election clear and the thing absolutely rips off the bottom into year end we expect a similar type of uh analog for this year uh this is from Ryan Dietrich uh talking about the October return after you&#39;ve had a big start average is 3% so um Max lust harvesting we covered uh but those are the reasons to be pessimistic shortterm here are the reasons to be optimistic into year end China pushes for faster local Bond sales to boost growth I.E more fiscal stimulus coming to a theater near you Global liquidity is picking

Q4 on balance up 2.3% uh so um so even if you have a weaker October you&#39;re going to see some recovery meaningful recovery in November and December uh other reason to be excited uh this is the most amount of cuts uh that we&#39;ve seen since March of 2020 and if you were a buyer when we did that article in market watch on March 23rd when everyone was hunkered under the table uh you can find it

    "QUOTES_OF_THE_WEEK": "\n\n### HEADLINES_AND_NEWS\nthis week and at the end of last week Bloomberg&#39;s got a report the Wall Street journal&#39;s got a report that you know private Equity might come in and maybe Qualcomm maybe who knows what arm but but one thing that&#39;s been reported is that Intel&#39;s pretty much rebuffed a lot of this you know I got to tell you Pat gelsinger I&#39;ve met him several times is as bright as they come he&#39;s the right guy at the right time for that company the problem why I mean he&#39;s lagging here he&#39;s been at the helm for a couple of years so I think unfortunately Intel remains dead money I don&#39;t know why they rebuffed these offers because that could have been salvation it seems to me that there&#39;s a lot of blunt thinking inside their headquarters right now and it&#39;s going to be bad for shareholders okay well at least for the week I see Intel up about 88.7%\n\n### HEADLINES_AND_NEWS\nTom said listen to Keith&#39;s picks and I will tell you that had our viewers listened to you a couple of years ago about one particular stock stay in it stay in it stay in it they would have made a lot of money and that is Palante teer and we look at some of the gains here uh it&#39;s it&#39;s quite unbelievable hitting brand new records uh not unbelievable because you&#39;ve been here telling us about that where does the stock go you&#39;re you&#39;re very kind to remember that thank you I think we&#39;re going to take out 50 pretty quickly I&#39;m starting to think about 85 but three to five years from now there&#39;s zero doubt in my mind we&#39;re looking at a hundred bucks a share so it&#39;s going to be volatile going to be a tough stock to own but I encourage people to stay with it if you can yeah big Daya aggregator great to see you both have a good weekend gentlemen\n\n### HEADLINES_AND_NEWS\nplease pull up the DOW Industrials the smmp and the NASDAQ please they&#39;re they&#39;re moving south that is because the US has indications that Iran is preparing to launch a ballistic missile attack against Israel that would be a very very serious development in international relations an extension of the war and we&#39;d like to know what our response what America&#39;s response would be if this happened I think that&#39;s Weighing on the market now let&#39;s get back to the dock strike uh 45,000 workers on strike Tom Hayes joins me uh to watch the market for us do you expect Biden to intervene within a week as I&#39;m I&#39;m suggesting that in my opinion piece there what do you say I absolutely agree with you you Ste I think Biden&#39;s going to intervene he just doesn&#39;t know it yet because effectively the last thing you want to see going into an election is 401ks going down and the cost of eggs and wood and all the supplies to North Carolina going up this could be if they fumble the ball the best thing that ever happened to Donald Trump in terms of the election because uh right now we front-loaded a lot of shipping into the East Coast so for the next week it&#39;s only going to cost $34 billion after the first week it could start to cost $4 billion a day people are going to feel that and we&#39;re in a seasonally weak period of the stock market as a matter of fact in elections the next 10 days election years since 1955 are the most volatile and the lowest returns of the year of an election year so you compound that with Israel Iran you compound that with the strike I think he comes in in a week and a half and say if it&#39;s not resolved beforehand and says we&#39;re going to let this cool down to I don&#39;t know sometime in November well thank you right right but so you are telling me that if the strike lasts you know two weeks say the market will take a hit regardless of what President Biden does no question about it yeah I think the Market&#39;s going to start to extrapolate what that means uh in terms of you know 50% of the port shutting down can&#39;t get Goods Walmart&#39;s going to be hit Home Depot&#39;s going to be hit uh and then people will worry about the holidays as well so uh certainly the Public Public will even though a lot of the holiday supply has come in by the end of September uh as things run out as Price look consumer confidence it&#39;s been kind of dead on the mat why because prices are up so prices start to tick up again uh and they associate that with the Harris Biden Administration uh it&#39;s really going to bode well for Trump going into the election I want to get back to this breaking story the US has indications that Iran is preparing to launch a ballistic missile attack against Israel I&#39;m saying that that is part of the reason for the Market&#39;s decline we&#39;re down 3 30 now on the DOW Industrials is it a is it a big negative for the overall Market I think so we had indications of this headline uh midn next mid last week and we saw this type of volatility mid last week uh this is a factor and you have to think about see that on the screen right now uh the yield on the 10-year treasury is down that is the result of a flight to safety that&#39;s people putting money into dead safe 10year Treasures is that 10 yes it is the 10 year forcing the price up and the yield down right to safety that&#39;s my opinion vix is up oil is up 3% oil is at $70 a barrel I think on this breaking store it&#39;s happening as we speak it&#39;s interesting uh that last time I was on I said if you&#39;re on margin come off margin and the reason I said that is the skew which is the price to ensure against a one standard deviation correction think of 10% correction hit 10year highs in the last week that doesn&#39;t guarantee a correction but it indicates that uh we&#39;re fully invested but we&#39;re off of margin we we&#39;ll write out these short-term bumps through the election I think we we&#39;ll do fine after the election but you have to keep that in mind uh we made a lot of money don&#39;t borrow money to buy stocks it&#39;s not a good not right now\n\n### QUOTES_OF_THE_WEEK\nto buy when others are despondently selling and sell when others are euphorically buying takes the greatest courage but provides the greatest profit I can&#39;t tell you how many of you uh came to me and um have have uh expressed your gratitude for hanging in there and buying in the hole when no one was and we were buying every single week it was red and now you guys have made a ton of money\n\n### FEATURED_COMPANY_DEEP_DIVES\nas great and most incredible as things are rocking and rolling uh just want to keep in mind that uh we&#39;re just getting started as Walt Disney would say cuz most of our great picks are just now beginning to leave the station you know Baba as much as it&#39;s moved 70% off the lows in a handful of minutes uh you know this will consolidate and this will work higher there&#39;s no question about it uh Baxter same thing it&#39;s moved a lot from 32 to 40 but again just getting started this thing&#39;s going to work higher over the next few years with the turnaround plan two billion dollars of cost out of the business um $13 reducing cost they did they did what they said they were going to do as far as selling deleveraging doing all the plans CPS we just got great Auto Sales in September up from 151 run rate in August to 157 in September and that&#39;s before the cuts and incentives even start into year end so very excited about that my goodness it would have been the best quarter of ever uh it might have been but uh might have been the best quarter of ever um uh if you had CPS also but I think CPS is going to be the fourth quarter story which we&#39;re very excited about Disney I can&#39;t tell you how crowded the parks were and how amazing the experience was nothing to think about there they&#39;re raising the prices at uh Disney plus people have to have Disney if they have children if they don&#39;t Social Services comes in and takes your children away that thing is Off to the Races gener same story sad story for the people in Florida I hope everyone is doing well um uh managing through it but this demand is going to continue to increase and increase with the unstable grid and electricity demand Intel opportunity of a lifetime we bought in the High Teens as it flushed out we&#39;ll probably buy some more if it goes back and retests small caps just working their way higher I think this is again a fourth quarter story after the election like it usually is November December favors small caps and that&#39;s when we break to new highs which is pretty exciting as you know we got rid of the big Banks over the summer took profits uh but we kept our regionals this is going to work higher with small caps over time and to new highs we&#39;re excited about that PayPal rocketing off the bottom from 50 to 80 however it&#39;s just getting started ladies and gentlemen yes it&#39;s a huge move and yes it&#39;ll consolidate and yes it will work higher this is a huge position for us as well as Baba uh Stanley black and&amp; deck are breaking out here from this consolidation range it&#39;ll consolidate and work higher to new highs over the next few years this is the most exciting time ever to be involved in markets and picking stocks because this once in a 100 year uh situation with Co created the most incredible amazing opportunity that&#39;s slipping away from us by the way if you don&#39;t get new money in uh you know in the next couple of quarters uh you can still do well but but the wholesale opportunities that are still out there yes they&#39;re moving up and yes we are uh super excited about that but we want everyone on the train with us to take full advantage and um uh it&#39;s it&#39;s unbelievable because you know in the case of Baba it&#39;s like yeah yo so you bring your basis all the way down to the low 80s and then you know boom it shoots up to 115 but the options we had it&#39;s it&#39;s staggering what&#39;s happening with some of these four five 6X 7x and taking a little bit of uh WIS on those that expire in January it&#39;s unbelievable and um and VF Corp VF little little old VF Corp is now knocking on the door 20 we haven&#39;t even had a time to talk about it it&#39;s up from 10 to 20 and no one is even paying attention to it I love this stuff uh biotech also starting to break out I mean it&#39;s been all of this stuff and remember we kept saying wait till the FED Cuts wait till the fed well it&#39;s here ladies and gentlemen small caps China biotech small capat the the whole thing is playing out according to plan\n\n### MACRO_DATA_SLIDES\nlet&#39;s talk about some of the data for the week consecutive weekly declines in US 30-year mortgage rate uh eight weekly declines this is going to continue I think we&#39;ll see a it went from 7.2 to 6.12 I think we will see a high five handle maybe by the end of the year certainly by first quarter and that&#39;s going to ignite the housing market which will benefit uh further benefit Stanley Black and&amp; Decker further benefit um JRA and others gaval put this out over the last two decades China has had five big Equity rallies three of which have been fueled by stimulus we could be at the beginning of a fourth stimulus rally which raises expectations of 50 to 100% gains it&#39;s so interesting to see all the groups that were excessively negative on China and bearish now that they&#39;re up you know 50 70% a lot of these stocks off the bottom in a matter of weeks uh they&#39;re all saying uh they&#39;re excited and just getting started and uh so they were telling people to sell 50% ago and now they&#39;re telling them to buy which means we probably consolidate at some point in the next few weeks and then um uh punish all the ones chasing at you know 120 130 and um uh and then they&#39;ll sell back at 110 and and and um and then it&#39;ll take up take back off to 150 so we covered that last week uh HSI shares has triggered its strongest breath advance in history a classic bull market initiation signal so that&#39;s good news the cost of bearish bets slumps as China stocks rally Global monetary easing September saw the biggest month of easing since April of 2020 this is something we&#39;ve been talking about for months that&#39;s playing out if you did you want to be a buyer or seller uh when this type of easing happened in the first quarter of 2020 you wanted to be a buyer and we were go back to the podcast tapes we were one of the few and it was one of the biggest most incredible years ever uh and then um uh 2009 same story so that that&#39;s that this is shows the seasonality of the first 10 days of October in an election presidential election year from 1928 this is the most volatile um a negative uh period of the Year doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;ll uh necessarily repeat but uh it&#39;s nice that uh we we built up some cash we sold Centum in the last couple of weeks we sold um and we took a lot of uh profits across a slew of options that were up four five 6 7x spreads Etc and um and uh and then after the first 10 days you move into a more favorable period and then following the election straight up that&#39;s a positive thing\n\n### MISCELLANEOUS\nokay so this is talking about if the market does well from July through October then the existing party stays in power if it does poorly the new party gets in power that makes sense we&#39;ll see how it plays out this time there&#39;s this consumer conf confidence factor and as I said on vanney if they fumble the strike and and stock prices 401K start to go down and prices start to go up uh that could change the whole Dynamics if they get to it quickly you know it&#39;s it&#39;s probably um we&#39;ll we&#39;ll see how it plays out but uh I think as it stands the Republicans will get the Senate the Democrats probably get the house and the presidency is a coin flip based on what happens in the next few weeks weeks uh economic surprise Index this is turning up that&#39;s what you see in expansions not contractions median floor area decreased remember we&#39;ve been covering this for three years we said not every starter home needs to be 5,000 square foot with an indoor pool uh that you know people can actually have a th000 and 2,000 square foot homes and like they did in um I think levit town in the 50s that&#39;s starting to play out that&#39;s going to allow a lot more people into the starter home land which is a good thing uh long dated US Treasury returns near 62- we lows so we&#39;ve had that huge rally off the bottom I think that&#39;s going to consolidate for a while um uh us large cap 10year rolling returns well above historical average I think that&#39;s overdone a little bit give small caps a chance give Emerging Markets Emerging Markets outperform developed which we covered on Liz uh small small greater than large um small greater than large Emerging Markets greater than developed markets value over growth unmagnify over Consumer Staples that&#39;s those are the themes going forward China msci earnings per share um trading at uh forward p ps is 6.5 times it&#39;s unbelievable and uh this is uh just showing at the bottom of the range msci profit margins are going up in the last two years not down this is msci China by the way this is all from yardeni uh valuation multiple again High single digit still even after this rally which is super exciting",

Social Services comes in and takes your children away that thing is Off to the Races gener same story sad story for the people in Florida I hope everyone is doing well um uh managing through it but this demand is going to continue to increase and increase with the unstable grid and electricity demand Intel opportunity of a lifetime we bought in the High Teens as it flushed out we&#39;ll probably buy some more if it goes back and retests small caps just working their way higher I think this is again a fourth quarter story after the election like it usually is November December favors small caps and that&#39;s when we break to new highs which is pretty exciting as you know we got rid of the big Banks over the summer took profits uh but we kept our regionals this is going to work higher with small caps over time and to new highs we&#39;re excited about that PayPal rocketing off the bottom from 50 to 80 however it&#39;s just getting started ladies and gentlemen yes it&#39;s a huge move and yes it&#39;ll consolidate and yes it will work higher this is a huge position for us as well as Baba uh Stanley black and&amp; deck are breaking out here from this consolidation range it&#39;ll consolidate and work higher to new highs over the next few years this is the most exciting time ever to be involved in markets and picking stocks because this once in a 100 year uh situation with Co created the most incredible amazing opportunity that&#39;s slipping away from us by the way if you don&#39;t get new money in uh you know in the next couple of quarters uh you can still do well but but the wholesale opportunities that are still out there yes they&#39;re moving up and yes we are uh super excited about that but we want everyone on the train with us to take full advantage and um uh it&#39;s it&#39;s unbelievable because you know in the case of Baba it&#39;s like yeah yo so you bring your basis all the way down to the low 80s and then you know boom it shoots up to 115 but the options we had it&#39;s it&#39;s staggering what&#39;s happening with some of these four five 6X 7x and taking a little bit of uh WIS on those that expire in January it&#39;s unbelievable and um and VF Corp VF little little old VF Corp is now knocking on the door 20 we haven&#39;t even had a time to talk about it it&#39;s up from 10 to 20 and no one is even paying attention to it I love this stuff uh biotech also starting to break out I mean it&#39;s been all of this stuff and remember we kept saying wait till the FED Cuts wait till the fed well it&#39;s here ladies and gentlemen small caps China biotech small capat the the whole thing is playing out according to plan\n\n### MACRO_DATA_SLIDES\nlet&#39;s talk about some of the data for the week consecutive weekly declines in US 30-year mortgage rate uh eight weekly declines this is going to continue I think we&#39;ll see a it went from 7.2 to 6.12 I think we will see a high five handle maybe by the end of the year certainly by first quarter and that&#39;s going to ignite the housing market which will benefit uh further benefit Stanley Black and&amp; Decker further benefit um JRA and others gaval put this out over the last two decades China has had five big Equity rallies three of which have been fueled by stimulus we could be at the beginning of a fourth stimulus rally which raises expectations of 50 to 100% gains it&#39;s so interesting to see all the groups that were excessively negative on China and bearish now that they&#39;re up you know 50 70% a lot of these stocks off the bottom in a matter of weeks uh they&#39;re all saying uh they&#39;re excited and just getting started and uh so they were telling people to sell 50% ago and now they&#39;re telling them to buy which means we probably consolidate at some point in the next few weeks and then um uh punish all the ones chasing at you know 120 130 and um uh and then they&#39;ll sell back at 110 and and and um and then it&#39;ll take up take back off to 150 so we covered that last week uh HSI shares has triggered its strongest breath advance in history a classic bull market initiation signal so that&#39;s good news the cost of bearish bets slumps as China stocks rally Global monetary easing September saw the biggest month of easing since April of 2020 this is something we&#39;ve been talking about for months that&#39;s playing out if you did you want to be a buyer or seller uh when this type of easing happened in the first quarter of 2020 you wanted to be a buyer and we were go back to the podcast tapes we were one of the few and it was one of the biggest most incredible years ever uh and then um uh 2009 same story so that that&#39;s that this is shows the seasonality of the first 10 days of October in an election presidential election year from 1928 this is the most volatile um a negative uh period of the Year doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;ll uh necessarily repeat but uh it&#39;s nice that uh we we built up some cash we sold Centum in the last couple of weeks we sold um and we took a lot of uh profits across a slew of options that were up four five 6 7x spreads Etc and um and uh and then after the first 10 days you move into a more favorable period and then following the election straight up that&#39;s a positive thing\n\n### MISCELLANEOUS\nokay so this is talking about if the market does well from July through October then the existing party stays in power if it does poorly the new party gets in power that makes sense we&#39;ll see how it plays out this time there&#39;s this consumer conf confidence factor and as I said on vanney if they fumble the strike and and stock prices 401K start to go down and prices start to go up uh that could change the whole Dynamics if they get to it quickly you know it&#39;s it&#39;s probably um we&#39;ll we&#39;ll see how it plays out but uh I think as it stands the Republicans will get the Senate the Democrats probably get the house and the presidency is a coin flip based on what happens in the next few weeks weeks uh economic surprise Index this is turning up that&#39;s what you see in expansions not contractions median floor area decreased remember we&#39;ve been covering this for three years we said not every starter home needs to be 5,000 square foot with an indoor pool uh that you know people can actually have a th000 and 2,000 square foot homes and like they did in um I think levit town in the 50s that&#39;s starting to play out that&#39;s going to allow a lot more people into the starter home land which is a good thing uh long dated US Treasury returns near 62- we lows so we&#39;ve had that huge rally off the bottom I think that&#39;s going to consolidate for a while um uh us large cap 10year rolling returns well above historical average I think that&#39;s overdone a little bit give small caps a chance give Emerging Markets Emerging Markets outperform developed which we covered on Liz uh small small greater than large um small greater than large Emerging Markets greater than developed markets value over growth unmagnify over Consumer Staples that&#39;s those are the themes going forward China msci earnings per share um trading at uh forward p ps is 6.5 times it&#39;s unbelievable and uh this is uh just showing at the bottom of the range msci profit margins are going up in the last two years not down this is msci China by the way this is all from yardeni uh valuation multiple again High single digit still even after this rally which is super exciting",
    "MACRO_DATA_SLIDES": "\n\n### HEADLINES_AND_NEWS\nthis week and at the end of last week Bloomberg&#39;s got a report the Wall Street journal&#39;s got a report that you know private Equity might come in and maybe Qualcomm maybe who knows what arm but but one thing that&#39;s been reported is that Intel&#39;s pretty much rebuffed a lot of this you know I got to tell you Pat gelsinger I&#39;ve met him several times is as bright as they come he&#39;s the right guy at the right time for that company the problem why I mean he&#39;s lagging here he&#39;s been at the helm for a couple of years so I think unfortunately Intel remains dead money I don&#39;t know why they rebuffed these offers because that could have been salvation it seems to me that there&#39;s a lot of blunt thinking inside their headquarters right now and it&#39;s going to be bad for shareholders okay well at least for the week I see Intel up about 88.7%\n\n### HEADLINES_AND_NEWS\nTom said listen to Keith&#39;s picks and I will tell you that had our viewers listened to you a couple of years ago about one particular stock stay in it stay in it stay in it they would have made a lot of money and that is Palante teer and we look at some of the gains here uh it&#39;s it&#39;s quite unbelievable hitting brand new records uh not unbelievable because you&#39;ve been here telling us about that where does the stock go you&#39;re you&#39;re very kind to remember that thank you I think we&#39;re going to take out 50 pretty quickly I&#39;m starting to think about 85 but three to five years from now there&#39;s zero doubt in my mind we&#39;re looking at a hundred bucks a share so it&#39;s going to be volatile going to be a tough stock to own but I encourage people to stay with it if you can yeah big Daya aggregator great to see you both have a good weekend gentlemen\n\n### HEADLINES_AND_NEWS\nplease pull up the DOW Industrials the smmp and the NASDAQ please they&#39;re they&#39;re moving south that is because the US has indications that Iran is preparing to launch a ballistic missile attack against Israel that would be a very very serious development in international relations an extension of the war and we&#39;d like to know what our response what America&#39;s response would be if this happened I think that&#39;s Weighing on the market now let&#39;s get back to the dock strike uh 45,000 workers on strike Tom Hayes joins me uh to watch the market for us do you expect Biden to intervene within a week as I&#39;m I&#39;m suggesting that in my opinion piece there what do you say I absolutely agree with you you Ste I think Biden&#39;s going to intervene he just doesn&#39;t know it yet because effectively the last thing you want to see going into an election is 401ks going down and the cost of eggs and wood and all the supplies to North Carolina going up this could be if they fumble the ball the best thing that ever happened to Donald Trump in terms of the election because uh right now we front-loaded a lot of shipping into the East Coast so for the next week it&#39;s only going to cost $34 billion after the first week it could start to cost $4 billion a day people are going to feel that and we&#39;re in a seasonally weak period of the stock market as a matter of fact in elections the next 10 days election years since 1955 are the most volatile and the lowest returns of the year of an election year so you compound that with Israel Iran you compound that with the strike I think he comes in in a week and a half and say if it&#39;s not resolved beforehand and says we&#39;re going to let this cool down to I don&#39;t know sometime in November well thank you right right but so you are telling me that if the strike lasts you know two weeks say the market will take a hit regardless of what President Biden does no question about it yeah I think the Market&#39;s going to start to extrapolate what that means uh in terms of you know 50% of the port shutting down can&#39;t get Goods Walmart&#39;s going to be hit Home Depot&#39;s going to be hit uh and then people will worry about the holidays as well so uh certainly the Public Public will even though a lot of the holiday supply has come in by the end of September uh as things run out as Price look consumer confidence it&#39;s been kind of dead on the mat why because prices are up so prices start to tick up again uh and they associate that with the Harris Biden Administration uh it&#39;s really going to bode well for Trump going into the election I want to get back to this breaking story the US has indications that Iran is preparing to launch a ballistic missile attack against Israel I&#39;m saying that that is part of the reason for the Market&#39;s decline we&#39;re down 3 30 now on the DOW Industrials is it a is it a big negative for the overall Market I think so we had indications of this headline uh midn next mid last week and we saw this type of volatility mid last week uh this is a factor and you have to think about see that on the screen right now uh the yield on the 10-year treasury is down that is the result of a flight to safety that&#39;s people putting money into dead safe 10year Treasures is that 10 yes it is the 10 year forcing the price up and the yield down right to safety that&#39;s my opinion vix is up oil is up 3% oil is at $70 a barrel I think on this breaking store it&#39;s happening as we speak it&#39;s interesting uh that last time I was on I said if you&#39;re on margin come off margin and the reason I said that is the skew which is the price to ensure against a one standard deviation correction think of 10% correction hit 10year highs in the last week that doesn&#39;t guarantee a correction but it indicates that uh we&#39;re fully invested but we&#39;re off of margin we we&#39;ll write out these short-term bumps through the election I think we we&#39;ll do fine after the election but you have to keep that in mind uh we made a lot of money don&#39;t borrow money to buy stocks it&#39;s not a good not right now\n\n### QUOTES_OF_THE_WEEK\nto buy when others are despondently selling and sell when others are euphorically buying takes the greatest courage but provides the greatest profit I can&#39;t tell you how many of you uh came to me and um have have uh expressed your gratitude for hanging in there and buying in the hole when no one was and we were buying every single week it was red and now you guys have made a ton of money\n\n### FEATURED_COMPANY_DEEP_DIVES\nas great and most incredible as things are rocking and rolling uh just want to keep in mind that uh we&#39;re just getting started as Walt Disney would say cuz most of our great picks are just now beginning to leave the station you know Baba as much as it&#39;s moved 70% off the lows in a handful of minutes uh you know this will consolidate and this will work higher there&#39;s no question about it uh Baxter same thing it&#39;s moved a lot from 32 to 40 but again just getting started this thing&#39;s going to work higher over the next few years with the turnaround plan two billion dollars of cost out of the business um $13 reducing cost they did they did what they said they were going to do as far as selling deleveraging doing all the plans CPS we just got great Auto Sales in September up from 151 run rate in August to 157 in September and that&#39;s before the cuts and incentives even start into year end so very excited about that my goodness it would have been the best quarter of ever uh it might have been but uh might have been the best quarter of ever um uh if you had CPS also but I think CPS is going to be the fourth quarter story which we&#39;re very excited about Disney I can&#39;t tell you how crowded the parks were and how amazing the experience was nothing to think about there they&#39;re raising the prices at uh Disney plus people have to have Disney if they have children if they don&#39;t Social Services comes in

after this rally which is super exciting\n### TECHNICAL_CHARTS\nhere is  a list of draw downs from Wisdom Tree Russell still trading below we like Russ small caps Russell 2000 and Emerging Markets these are your two big money opportunities ladies and gentlemen for the next 18 months that&#39;s going to continue I love I can&#39;t stop posting this chart uh with China short China equities was one of the most crowded trades for the last few months uh that they can&#39;t even get out of their shorts it&#39;s I mean could you imagine these guys are upside down 100% in a matter of weeks you&#39;re going to see a lot of them blow up the people that have been short and and um and that&#39;s the story Emerging Markets versus developed markets performance you can see it here hockey stick straight up cyclicals versus defensive starting to pick up now uh everyone crowded into defensives ahead of the cut we covered the economic surprise index here&#39;s the composition of S&P Equity capitalization you can see Tech at 32% but they&#39;re only 21% of the earnings so that&#39;s why we say large cap underperforms or magnificent 7even underperforms un magnificent 493 you can see sector by sector I think uh an interesting story here would be uh financials at 21% of the earnings and 133% of the weight so that uh speaks to the small cap uh that speaks to the um uh um Regional Bank index that we we still hold\n\n### MACRO_DATA_SLIDES\nstruction going through the roof in line with our themes we've been talking about construction spending is now ticking back up uh Stanley gener Etc we've been positioned for that job openings are ticking back up that's a good sign probably because of the rate cut and uh some positive outlook there job openings monthly change the biggest ad is been in construction and food services and local government excluding education manufacturing we covered that uh GDP now estimates for Q3 are at 2.5% economic surprise index Just Hockey sticking up that's what you see in expansions not contraction ports affected by the strike handle about 25% of total us Goods Imports 2.8% of GDP and 27% of total us good exports 1.9% of GDP so it's not it's totally material it's not completely devastating it's going to be a key of time they can let it go for a week because uh they already front loaded all the shipping to the West Coast and to the east coast ahead of this deadline but after a week it's going to start to cost four or five billion a day and then you're going to see the pain in the Walmarts the Ikeas the Samsungs Bob's Discount Furniture Home Depot Etc we covered this last week head fund billionaire David teer says he's loading up on China stocks after the nation stimulus bazooka so after they're up 50 60% but he also had Baba as his number one position in recent quarters so welcome to the party Intel and US race to finalize 8.5 billion in chips funding by Year's End uh that is going to continue um uh and be a very positive thing for Intel moving forward um moving on China's poet burrow super supercharges stimulus with housing rate valves Etc so they did the rates they lowered the mortgage rates uh on trillions Yuan of mortgages they did the uh Bond issuance for a quarter trillion dollars of fiscal stimulus and it's just beginning they keep saying we'll do more we'll do more we'll do more and uh the market is\n\n### MACRO_DATA_SLIDES\nhere is  Ned Davis the cycle composite for the election year 2024 you see here beginning of October gets weak all the way to the last week of October mid-mon Spike and then you get the election clear and the thing absolutely rips off the bottom into year end we expect a similar type of uh analog for this year uh this is from Ryan Dietrich uh talking about the October return after you&#39;ve had a big start average is 3% so um but those are the reasons to be pessimistic shortterm here are the reasons to be optimistic into year end China pushes for faster local Bond sales to boost growth I.E more fiscal stimulus coming to a theater near you Global liquidity is picking up after troughing in 2 late 2022 2023 has isn&#39;t anywhere near euphoric levels and probably will hit Peak around 2026 to passes any prologue price returns during the presidential cycle since 1945 Q4 on balance up 2.3% uh so um so even if you have a weaker October you&#39;re going to see some recovery meaningful recovery in November and December uh other reason to be excited uh this is the most amount of cuts uh that we&#39;ve seen since March of 2020 and if you were a buyer when we did that article in market watch on March 23rd when everyone was hunkered under the table uh you can find it on on the website by the way you can just go go into the search bar type market watch and you it&#39;ll come up uh scroll back to 2020 March 23rd Market bottom the next day uh this is a similar situation you get this kind of easing early 2009 in March of 2020 those were

    "### MACRO_DATA_SLIDES": "\n\nfrom Bank of America S&amp;P divides gravity in seasonally weakest month so that was September uh strongest Q3 since 2020 marked by a big rotation equal weight S&amp;P jumped 99.4% versus the cap weighted S&amp;P five 5.5 what does that mean UNM magnificent 493 outperformed magnificent 7 which has been our theme for weeks and weeks and weeks we&#39;ve been talking about this it&#39;s played out 67% of the stocks in the S&amp;P 500 outperformed the index in Q3 998th percentile in history his ly only 31% of the stocks in the S&amp;P ever outperform the index value over growth for the first quarter since fourth quarter of 2022 dividend shine midcaps break out of the middle of the to lead September midcaps were up uh let&#39;s see like wrest after leaving the corter okay so midcaps are taking off stocks you don&#39;t pick make all of the difference uh so 69% outperform this quarter which is exciting and then indices so this is interesting I highlighted energy because it&#39;s doing so poorly uh energy and materials are two areas I&#39;ve got my eyes on as it relates to energy we have com stock we think that&#39;s going to work higher that&#39;s plenty but we are looking at some of we&#39;re not looking at the integrated they&#39;re not cheap enough for us uh we are looking at some of the servicers we may have more to say about that in coming weeks but for now we have nothing to say uh materials we&#39;re looking in that space we have a small position we&#39;ve talked about in albamar that&#39;s starting to take off uh off the mat uh but nothing um there but that&#39;s an area that we&#39;re starting to spend more time looking at and then um index relative price return distribution analysis so yeah you can see energy and materials have underperformed so we think that&#39;s going to be the story maybe late this year and certainly next year Healthcare a lot of opportunities biotech is going to work higher raising materials to overweight from Market weight again that&#39;s from Bank of America because of China stimulus because fed cutting in F cutting into an accelerating profit cycle means reflation long onlys are underweight materials a decade of underinvestment in manufacturing we&#39;re seeing that construction manufacturing start to take off Dr copper is turning up and new household formation is next because why engagement recovery is happening searches for engagement rings are up significantly in recent months according to Signet CEO dros on September 12th this makes sense to Lorraine Hutchinson uh typical three-year cycle of meet date engagement was stalled by covid but likely recovered by 2021 new household formation generally follows which is linked to materials returns new housing formation materials so we want to take advantage underinvestment in structure tangible cap capex since 1990 that&#39;s starting to pick back up um materials trades below its historical premium so again we want to look let me make another note to myself find some action in materials find some action in oil servicers and uh we&#39;ll see how uh the opportunity presents itself in coming weeks Bank of America analyst positive in the last three months on Industrials and materials so do they&#39;re doing more upgrades than downgrades uh sectors that do well uh after the first cut looking out healthc care is W so that biotech that we have is going to be phenomenal and we&#39;re going to get paid just like Baba for waiting and we&#39;re going to be paid bigly as they say uh biggest relative overweight in defensive versus cyclical since May TW 20 this is what we&#39;ve been talking about that&#39;s started to change now the discretionary are outperforming the Staples I think we&#39;ll we&#39;ll have some opport opportunities in uh October to pick some up on the cheap which is why we&#39;ve raised some cash which we&#39;re excited about uh and risk appetite is at 11-month low so dips are to be bought people are still skeptical then you&#39;ve also got tax loss harvesting brace for Red October uh tax loss harvesting from institutional investors became increasingly prevalent after the tax reform act in 1986 which mandated October 31st as the cut off for most mutual funds to realize capital gains tax loss selling by institutional investors October is also empirically borne out by flows and performance since 1986 stocks down 10% or more as of September month end have consistently lagged the S&amp;P in October by an average of 85 basis points and a stable ended performance hit rate of 63% before November&#39;s bounceback we screen for S&amp;P stocks down over 10% year-to date underweight by long only and they go through a bunch of lists so um US stocks that can this is not that list this is a different list first US stocks that can benefit from a rally in Chinese equities for those of you who are scared to own China equities and missed out on all this what comes to the to the top of the list J Estee louder and Stanley Black and&amp; Decker so we&#39;re getting two three bites at the Apple US Stocks with sales exposure to China uh that are going to benefit Qualcomm is interesting I wouldn&#39;t mind seeing the Qualcomm Intel I don&#39;t think it&#39;s going to come together I&#39;d probably buy Qualcomm discreetly but Intel is a better deal for me uh but if they came came together I would hold hoddle till the cows come home um other companies that uh have sales exposure to China I China recovers they&#39;ll benefit Las Vegas Sands um Intel uh let&#39;s see here APD I want to look at that one eBay I didn&#39;t realize that that&#39;s interesting Starbucks obviously Nike Lululemon um wi Resorts obviously all right dividends likely to contribute more to Total returns during than during the last decade we&#39;ve covered this dividend payers are dividend yield is still inexpensive relative to history it hasn&#39;t been this cheap since 2001 this goes back to our repeated analog 2002 to 2007 hedge funds exposure to cyclical versus defensives is just off an all-time low which is why you want to own cyclicals they&#39;ve been underweight they will be chasing up just like they&#39;re chasing in China and late to the park and then long and short the longest and shortest sectors the shortest is energy um so again I think we&#39;re going to see some opportunity there hedge funds have the highest relative exposure versus the S&amp;P to industrial&#39;s lowest to energy so again energy there&#39;s got to be a pony in that pile we have com stock we&#39;re going to probably out a serer and uh we&#39;ll take it from there Commodities 10year rolling returns uh ju yes it&#39;s at 10e Highs but it&#39;s coming like off depression death from 2000 and a long way to run in that story um fund manager survey underweight resources Commodities Emerging Markets versus history they&#39;re going to have to play catchup so energy again Industrials um Emerging Markets what do they overweight utilities uh so you know we&#39;ve talked about utilities uh no one wanted them in October when we were pounding the table uh last year and everyone wants them up 50 60% now we think that&#39;s going to a little bit long in the tooth as to consolidate those gains jobless claims sync to four-month low businesses aren&#39;t hiring or firing many people maau Hotel occupancy rate back to pre pandemic levels this is a big big deal that&#39;s a indicative of China consumer and VIPs and the wealthy feeling better about things energy sector versus the S&amp;P broke this downtrend I most technical analysts say this is terrible this is bad I think this is still uh I think this is representing an opportunity retail continues to have significant size bias in favor of large over smid smid and M cap uh that&#39;s exactly what you want to take the opposite side is retail chases the large cap uh the nvidias ETC and uh the opportuni is going to be in the small and mid and already is uh consumer sentiment starting to tick back up this Port strike will see how it&#39;s handled could could take it back down uh temporarily manufacturing and Warehouse construction going through the roof in line with our themes we&#39;ve been talking about construction spending is now ticking back up uh Stanley gener Etc we&#39;ve been positioned for that job openings are ticking back up that&#39;s a good sign probably because of the rate cut and uh some positive outlook there job openings monthly change the biggest ad is been in construction and food services and local government excluding education manufacturing we covered that uh GDP now estimates for Q3 are at 2.5% economic surprise index Just Hockey sticking up that&#39;s what you see in expansions not contraction ports affected by the strike handle about 25% of total us Goods Imports 2.8% of GDP and 27% of total us good exports 1.9% of GDP so it&#39;s not it&#39;s totally material it&#39;s not completely devastating it&#39;s going to be a key of time they can let it go for a week because uh they already front loaded all the shipping to the West Coast and to the east coast ahead of this deadline but after a week it&#39;s going to start to cost four or five billion a day and then you&#39;re going to see the pain in the Walmarts the Ikeas the Samsungs Bob&#39;s Discount Furniture Home Depot Etc we covered this last week head fund billionaire David teer says he&#39;s loading up on China stocks after the nation stimulus bazooka so after they&#39;re up 50 60% but he also had Baba as his number one position in recent quarters so welcome to the party Intel and US race to finalize 8.5 billion in chips funding by Year&#39;s End uh that is going to continue um uh and be a very positive thing for Intel moving forward um moving on China&#39;s poet burrow super supercharges stimulus with housing rate valves Etc so they did the rates they lowered the mortgage rates uh on trillions Yuan of mortgages they did the uh Bond issuance for a quarter trillion dollars of fiscal stimulus and it&#39;s just beginning they keep saying we&#39;ll do more we&#39;ll do more we&#39;ll do more and uh the market is",

your podcast a long time love the disciplined approach and framework many thanks for sharing your wisdom well many thanks for listening uh podcast human is on your radar what are your thoughts on Humanity now the stock is going down stock is 20 uh okay so let&#39;s see what&#39;s happening with human we haven&#39;t done anything with this yet we&#39;re not in a rush to do anything we&#39;ve got a lot of companies that we love uh what is going on here all right well it&#39;s more on our radar now than it was the when when we uh talked about it a week or so ago uh yeah there was something about the ah what the heck was it it was something about the uh reimbursements that they&#39;re going to get hit for a few billion dollars or something like that I think was the news 2025 membership for its top rated Medicare plan Medicare star ratings okay so I&#39;ll look into that that probably creates an opportunity let me put that down next to oil services materials and human not doing anything on that yet no real change I mean we just look at the fundamentals on this call that&#39;s like 1% of the work then you got to really dig into the business and we haven&#39;t done that yet because we we simply don&#39;t have a place for it yet so uh we&#39;re happy with our current holding Tim felmingham we&#39;re you know we get I&#39;ve covered this a million times but let me emphasize for the new listeners because if you&#39;re on this it&#39;s you know we have a ton of people on this call a lot of family offices a lot of ultra high net worth ctim millionaires half billionaires and multi-billionaires on this call and most of them got very very successful as entrepreneurs um and the way you become successful as an entrepreneur is through Massive Action and in

positives what needs to happen for Intel become a buy now there is  no buy now think you&#39;re going to get the perfect day or the perfect week you&#39;re out of your mind you don&#39;t get multi-baggers that way you get multi-baggers because you apply a framework you look at solvency risk you know we&#39;re looking at the the guarantee the implicit government guarantee and um you know they&#39;re going to ship the gouty 3 people are going to see how incredible it is the lunar lake is going the 18a they&#39;ll get the8 billion from the chips sa all these things will start to click but you&#39;re not going to pick the buy now you&#39;re going to buy some at 23 you&#39;re going to buy some at maybe at 17 you&#39;re going to buy some at 25 maybe uh and then you know two three four years out it&#39;s $40 50 $60 and if they actually start producing these uh competitive chips the gpus versus the CPUs of their legacy business which is worth 40 to 50 bucks uh then you can have a hundred bucks but uh we don&#39;t know yet they&#39;ve got to deliver but in the meantime you know we look at our downsides pretty much protected if they liquidated the company today uh You&#39; probably get back you know full 20 25 bucks it&#39;s trading below tangible book uh oh and by the way their company doing 50 some OD billion dollars of Revenue that the US government is dependent on uh for geopolitical uh strategic uh safety uh so the last time you had a company that was fully backstopped by the government it was called Tesla because they were so intent on on pushing these EVs and Tesla was subsidized billions upon billions of dollar and created one of the greatest companies in the world I think Intel has the opportunity to take advantage of that single-minded because people can&#39;t just set up a Fab I mean Intel is so far ahead of what anyone else could do so as much as everyone wants to buy the arms and the nvidias and the um um Le amds and all that stuff they are the designer they are so dependent on the ability of tsmc Samsung or Intel to produce their stuff they can design all day long if they can&#39;t produce they&#39;re worthless so for me that puts uh and Intel is the only game in town so effectively what&#39;s setting up with Intel is a monopoly uh government-backed Monopoly which are the greatest kinds of Monopoly which is effectively what happened with Tesla uh during its run and um so uh so tell me how you really feel about Intel Tom all right\n\nlunar lake is going the 18a they&#39;ll get the8 billion from the chips sa all these

Mark Mello interested in your thoughts on British American Tobacco uh look cheap stock with the dividend uh I you know it&#39;s had this move you know these it&#39;s F there are better ways to use your money like if it was it&#39;ll probably grind sideways and pay your dividend but there are uh higher and better uses of capital than that and we&#39;ve covered that in recent weeks the financials are fine but it&#39;s like you know it&#39;s a literal cigar butt you know uh Ben Graham and Warren Buffett talked about cigar butts that&#39;s a cigar butt it&#39;s a declining business but they buy back stock they generate a ton of free cash flow from all the people that are addicted and it&#39;ll continue for some time and they&#39;ll buy some more uh addictive businesses like vaping and all the other stuff that&#39;s bad for people and they&#39;ll continue to pay the dividend but you know it look if it was cheaper I would buy it but I I don&#39;t really love uh that stuff Lou R Rue Reynolds love the show recommended to all my friends thank you very much and for all of you that have been listening in and getting tremendous value uh the number one compliment you can pay me is to share it with one friend or more who loves the markets and help them out as well um does Cooper standard have big risk exposure to the Port strike which started October 1st or do revenues just keep getting booked and customers get their orders later uh there&#39;s risk there&#39;s obviously risk 28% of goods go through there however um their risk is not as big as 90% of the other companies that have the risk and uh you have to make bets on um kind of game theory and and I would assume that if this goes for more than a week and a half or two Biden is going to have to step in or they&#39;re going to lose the election and um now Biden may say listen these guys push me out against my will uh payback&#39;s a I mean there&#39;s something to be said for that but I doubt the powers that be will allow that to happen and therefore I would bet on the obvious which is it either gets resolved or more likely he can save face and say look uh this is holiday season we have to get the goods in for Christmas therefore I&#39;m going to Institute Taft heartley just until November to get maybe November 6th or thereabouts just to get enough Goods in for Christmas so all the little boys and girls can be happy with their gifts and then they can go back to fighting November 6 right after the election um all right hi Tom Ronan bitten from Israel big fan hey Ronan look uh sorry to hear about

yes I like okay so we did the Vornado quick double last year vado&#39;s now back it&#39;s going I&#39;m not in love with multif family because there&#39;s so much new Supply on the market and coming on the market and starts um let me just look at their balance sheet I think this one&#39;s going to be okay but um balance sheet financial analysis balance sheet 61 debt is 12 billion cash is half a billion but secured by property what&#39;s the asset value 33 billion uh 33 billion or 38 is gross let&#39;s see all right let&#39;s look at this yeah this one&#39;s probably all right um I have to do a lot more work but it certainly warrants doing more work um my general view is there&#39;s going to be a counter Trend move in these rats and utilities so maybe rates back up a little bit for the short term and that&#39;ll be your opportunity to buy very small yield for what it is though 4.4 and you&#39;re not really going to get yeah I I think it&#39;s okay see if we get a little yield backup

other than he&#39;s executing exactly what he promised he would and we&#39;re we&#39;re comfortable with that um that&#39;s Shane o Kelly who ran HD Supply for Home Depot 7 billion doll business that was a beast and still is uh I wanted to ask you about WBA this is from Jan Jan I cover this every week it&#39;s not for me until they take the locks off the doors and they do some type of criminal reform where if you steal something from a store you actually go to jail I&#39;m not really interested this is a complete they&#39;re going to figure it out there&#39;s an enormous amount of value and there&#39;s only two players left but um they&#39;re just they&#39;re just hiring better uses um so all that would be is just a trade you&#39;re looking for a double bounce off the bottom and uh it&#39;s not what I do Yuki Nish Nisha I mean here&#39;s how I think about it by the way it&#39;s very simple this is the way you should go into every company if JP Morgan was going to finance me to to take private the entire Walgreens boot boots allons they would give me a credit line uh for whatever it&#39;s worth now tens of billions of dollars uh and I had to be the equity and put up 90% of my net worth to take the company private with JP Morgan&#39;s financing would I put 90% of my net worth up to buy Walgreens boots Alliance at these discounted levels and the answer is no therefore I&#39;m not going to play it for a double trade off the bottom um thanks for the great lessons you teach um all right so he&#39;s asking what this is from Yuki and Japan what has to happen for Advanced Auto Parts to get the same multiple as AutoZone and all that stuff it&#39;s going to take time but um I don&#39;t know if they&#39;ll ever get that multiple but they don&#39;t need to for it to be you know a double triple plus um it&#39;s just going to take a few years Jimbo Jones uh could you review valet okay I keep looking at valet and I keep passing and I keep wondering why I keep passing let me just see because this is a materials play I think you&#39;ll be okay here I just think that there are better plays in this base and um yeah I mean I think these cash I think the cash flow on revenues are going to pick back up but that&#39;s why the stock is down so it&#39;s not a big surprise I just think it&#39;s milk toast it it&#39;s not like I can&#39;t see myself getting a multibagger here so why even why even tie up the capital uh ocidental petroleum because they&#39;re doing carbon capture this is from Eric I I don&#39;t oxy is not going to move because they&#39;re doing car carbon capture I have no interest I don&#39;t think the integrated have come down enough for me to be interested and everyone keeps getting faked out because uh Buffett keeps buying it the problem is what they don&#39;t realize is Buffett is exercising warrants that he got here in 2019 look it up he did a debt financing and got a ton of free warrants at $59 so he&#39;s exercising those warrants he&#39;s not buying new stock uh as everyone thinks he is so for me you know the time to buy it was in 2020 when we were buying Exxon Mobile hand over fist in the hole now that it&#39;s up eight bagger everyone can you know oh no it&#39;s it&#39;s not for me because it&#39;s not going to double from here over I mean it might double from here but it&#39;s like Comstock could be a

amazing week in China this is from um Sagar uh kanakia thanks seagar I know you&#39;ve been listening for a long time uh so he&#39;s asking about Stanis the answer is no they keep asking me about the car makers I don&#39;t want to be in the car maker business because effectively all all they are is annuity companies and health insurance companies that happen to make automobiles they&#39;re controlled by the unions their margins are going to go down they&#39;re going to be forced to produce more cars it&#39;s going to be a race to the bottom and we are going to benefit from that race to the bottom because we are the Arms Dealer with Cooper standard so not interested in that am interested in higher volumes as they race to the bottom and we will take advantage could you please take a look at coals no interest in Coals that thing has been dead money for a while and I think will continue to be amazing past week for China okay we covered that it&#39;s amazing how exciting everyone is now by the way good stuff on Baba thanks Kayla human has taken a precipitous drop yeah I&#39;m looking at it uh not doing anything with it yet uh Boeing management potentially diluting shares a concern no that&#39;s a positive because they keep their investment rating they get more staying power against the unions they&#39;ll negotiate a better deal turn the spets back Lo back on deal with their backlog start to generate cash flow and buy back the stock Damian Langer oh sorry okay so\n\nfor me you know the time to buy it was in 2020 when we were buying Exxon Mobile hand over fist in the hole now that it&#39;s up eight bagger everyone can you know oh no it&#39;s it&#39;s not for me because it&#39;s not going to double from here over I mean it might double from here but it&#39;s like Comstock could be a multibagger uh in my view and that&#39;s where I want to take risk in the space and I think some of the servicers are getting uh to the point where they could be um at least

back on deal with their backlog start to generate cash flow and buy back the stock Damian Langer oh sorry okay so\n### ASK_ME_ANYTHING_QA\nwith that said  just make sure I&#39;m not missing anything uh yeah that was from Nolan about the AutoZone P just going to take time uh n deep uh be Beyond me Beyond not interested I don&#39;t care if it&#39;s down n he says it&#39;s down 96% it could be down 99% you couldn&#39;t pay me to eat that leather with your mouth so hard pass uh David Martin uh inmd they do uh okay let&#39;s take a look at inmd I think it&#39;s medical device is all right this is a broken stock let&#39;s see if they&#39;re generating any cash they are generating a lot of cash uh margins are holding in uh financial analysis let&#39;s see here all right so the only thing we have to do with a company like this is figure out uh what&#39;s the bare thesis because this looks good so it&#39;s going right underneath my oil services research my materials research my human and my inmd so I want to understand this there might be a comp competitive threat but this is definitely worth uh exploring so good job on that David Martin all right um Paul found cone I think oh by the way Paul says uh two more weeks and you&#39;ll hit the fiveyear mark for your podcast pretty incredible pretty awesome been great to watch you and protect your craft over the last few years thanks Paul uh pzza I don&#39;t know if we covered this or not I&#39;ve never liked it since the the founder uh got kicked out but um I can see let me just see if they&#39;re doing okay with revenues and cash flow I think this is going to work because this is going to fall in the discretionary bucket and I&#39;ve wanted to find some restaurants now that everyone hates them uh looks like cash flow is kind of okay gross margins okay yeah this one definitely deserves a look so uh good find Paul and just make sure here txt this is from JT um I think that&#39;s Textron yeah okay uh now for me I don&#39;t buy things that are up 5x uh in a in three years that someone else already took the juice out of that trade so I&#39;m going to pass fundamentals are okay cash flows declining stock pric is going up revenues are flat um pass so"

exposure to China I China recovers they&#39;ll benefit Las Vegas Sands um Intel uh let&#39;s see here APD I want to look at that one eBay I didn&#39;t realize that that&#39;s interesting Starbucks obviously Nike Lululemon um wi Resorts obviously all right dividends likely to contribute more to Total returns during than during the last decade we&#39;ve covered this dividend payers are dividend yield is still inexpensive relative to history it hasn&#39;t been this cheap since 2001 this goes back to our repeated analog 2002 to 2007 hedge funds exposure to cyclical versus defensives is just off an all-time low which is why you want to own cyclicals they&#39;ve been underweight they will be chasing up just like they&#39;re chasing in China and late to the park and then long and short the longest and shortest sectors the shortest is energy um so again I think we&#39;re going to see some opportunity there hedge funds have the highest relative exposure versus the S&amp;P to industrial&#39;s lowest to energy so again energy there&#39;s got to be a pony in that pile we have com stock we&#39;re going to probably out a serer and uh we&#39;ll take it from there Commodities

Commodities Emerging Markets versus history they&#39;re going to have to play catchup so energy again Industrials um Emerging Markets what do they overweight utilities uh so you know we&#39;ve talked about utilities uh no one wanted them in October when we were pounding the table uh last year and everyone wants them up 50 60% now we think that&#39;s going to a little bit long in the tooth as to consolidate those gains jobless claims sync to four-month low businesses aren&#39;t hiring or firing many people maau Hotel occupancy rate back to pre pandemic levels this is a big big deal that&#39;s a indicative of China consumer and VIPs and the wealthy feeling better about things energy sector versus the S&amp;P broke this downtrend I most technical analysts say this is terrible this is bad I think this is still uh I think this is representing an opportunity retail continues to have significant size bias in favor of large over smid smid and M cap uh that&#39;s exactly what you want to take the opposite side is retail chases the large cap uh the nvidias ETC and uh the opportuni is going to be in the small and mid and already is uh consumer sentiment starting to tick back up this Port strike will see how it&#39;s handled could could take it back down uh temporarily manufacturing and Warehouse construction going through the roof in line with our themes we&#39;ve been talking about construction spending is now ticking back up uh Stanley gener Etc we&#39;ve been positioned for that job openings are ticking back up that&#39;s a good sign probably because of the rate cut and uh some positive outlook there job openings monthly change the biggest ad is been in construction and food services and local government excluding education manufacturing we covered that uh GDP now estimates for Q3 are at 2.5% economic surprise index Just Hockey sticking up that&#39;s what you see in expansions not contraction ports affected by the strike handle about 25% of total us Goods Imports 2.8% of GDP and 27% of total us good exports 1.9% of GDP so it&#39;s not it&#39;s totally material it&#39;s not completely devastating it&#39;s going to be a key of time they can let it go for

      "sectors that do well uh after the first cut looking out healthc care is W so that biotech that we have is going to be phenomenal and we&#39;re going to get paid just like Baba for waiting and we&#39;re going to be paid bigly as they say uh biggest relative overweight in defensive versus cyclical since May TW 20 this is what we&#39;ve been talking about that&#39;s started to change now the discretionary are outperforming the Staples I think we&#39;ll we&#39;ll have some opport opportunities in uh October to pick some up on the cheap which is why we&#39;ve raised some cash which we&#39;re excited about uh and risk appetite is at 11-month low so dips are to be bought people are still skeptical then you&#39;ve also got tax loss harvesting brace for Red October uh tax loss harvesting from institutional investors became increasingly prevalent after the tax reform act in 1986 which mandated October 31st as the cut off for most mutual funds to realize capital gains tax loss selling by institutional investors October is also empirically borne out by flows and performance since 1986 stocks down 10% or more as of September month end have consistently lagged the S&amp;P in October by an average of 85 basis points and a stable ended performance hit rate of 63% before November&#39;s bounceback we screen for S&amp;P stocks down over 10% year-to date underweight by long only and they go through a bunch of lists so um US stocks that can this is not that list this is a different list first US stocks that can benefit from a rally in Chinese equities for those of you who are scared to own China equities and missed out on all this what comes to the to the top of the list J Estee louder and Stanley Black and&amp; Decker so we&#39;re getting two three bites at the Apple US Stocks with sales exposure to China uh that are going to benefit Qualcomm is interesting I wouldn&#39;t mind seeing the Qualcomm Intel I don&#39;t think it&#39;s going to come together I&#39;d probably buy Qualcomm discreetly but Intel is a better deal for me uh but if they came came together I would hold hoddle till the cows come home um other companies that uh have sales exposure to China I China recovers they&#39;ll benefit Las Vegas Sands um Intel uh let&#39;s see here APD I want to look at that one eBay I didn&#39;t realize that that&#39;s interesting Starbucks obviously Nike Lululemon um wi Resorts obviously all right dividends likely to contribute more to Total returns during than during the last decade we&#39;ve covered this dividend payers are dividend yield is still inexpensive relative to history it hasn&#39;t been this cheap since 2001 this goes back to our repeated analog 2002 to 2007 hedge funds exposure to cyclical versus defensives is just off an all-time low which is why you want to own cyclicals they&#39;ve been underweight they will be chasing up just like they&#39;re chasing in China and late to the park and then long and short the longest and shortest sectors the shortest is energy um so again I think we&#39;re going to see some opportunity there hedge funds have the highest relative exposure versus the S&amp;P to industrial&#39;s lowest to energy so again energy there&#39;s got to be a pony in that pile we have com stock we&#39;re going to probably out a serer and uh we&#39;ll take it from there Commodities 10year rolling returns uh ju yes it&#39;s at 10e Highs but it&#39;s coming like off depression death from 2000 and a long way to run in that story um fund manager survey underweight resources Commodities Emerging Markets versus history they&#39;re going to have to play catchup so energy again Industrials um Emerging Markets what do they overweight utilities uh so you know we&#39;ve talked about utilities uh no one wanted them in October when we were pounding the table uh last year and everyone wants them up 50 60% now we think that&#39;s going to a little bit long in the tooth as to consolidate those gains jobless claims sync to four-month low businesses aren&#39;t hiring or firing many people maau Hotel occupancy rate back to pre pandemic levels this is a big big deal that&#39;s a indicative of China consumer and VIPs and the wealthy feeling better about things energy sector versus the S&amp;P broke this downtrend I most technical analysts say this is terrible this is bad I think this is still uh I think this is representing an opportunity retail continues to have significant size bias in favor of large over smid smid and M cap uh that&#39;s exactly what you want to take the opposite side is retail chases the large cap uh the nvidias ETC and uh the opportuni is going to be in the small and mid and already is uh consumer sentiment starting to tick back up this Port strike will see how it&#39;s handled could could take it back down uh temporarily manufacturing and Warehouse construction going through the roof in line with our themes we&#39;ve been talking about construction spending is now ticking back up uh Stanley gener Etc we&#39;ve been positioned for that job openings are ticking back up that&#39;s a good sign probably because of the rate cut and uh some positive outlook there job openings monthly change the biggest ad is been in construction and food services and local government excluding education manufacturing we covered that uh GDP now estimates for Q3 are at 2.5% economic surprise index Just Hockey sticking up that&#39;s what you see in expansions not contraction ports affected by the strike handle about 25% of total us Goods Imports 2.8% of GDP and 27% of total us good exports 1.9% of GDP so it&#39;s not it&#39;s totally material it&#39;s not completely devastating it&#39;s going to be a key of time they can let it go for a week because uh they already front loaded all the shipping to the West Coast and to the east coast ahead of this deadline but after a week it&#39;s going to start to cost four or five billion a day and then you&#39;re going to see the pain in the Walmarts the Ikeas the Samsungs Bob&#39;s Discount Furniture Home Depot Etc we covered this last week head fund billionaire David teer says he&#39;s loading up on China stocks after the nation stimulus bazooka so after they&#39;re up 50 60% but he also had Baba as his number one position in recent quarters so welcome to the party Intel and US race to finalize 8.5 billion in chips funding by Year&#39;s End uh that is going to continue um uh and be a very positive thing for Intel moving forward um moving on China&#39;s poet burrow super supercharges stimulus
