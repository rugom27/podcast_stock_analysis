[162.04s] Clayman for having me on Friday with
[164.04s] Keith Keith
[165.48s] Fitzgerald uh friend of mine for sure
[168.599s] completely different strategies but uh
[170.959s] like I said there&#39;s many ways to skin
[172.64s] the cat so let&#39;s listen in here let&#39;s
[174.8s] just get to the floor show because it&#39;s
[176.48s] Friday joining me now a great Hill
[178.56s] Capital chairman Tom hay and the
[180.4s] Fitzgerald group principal Keith
[182.0s] Fitzgerald who said that Costco analysts
[185.0s] have got it all wrong he sees a positive
[187.36s] here first I&#39;m going to turn to Tom
[188.72s] Hayes though and get the macro picture
[190.76s] as we finish up a week that&#39;s had so
[192.84s] much news and a few decent records and
[195.239s] gains yeah I think we&#39;ve had two regime
[198.04s] changes in two weeks livz so the first
[200.12s] was the FED frontloading 50 basis point
[202.239s] cuts which implies a couple of things
[204.319s] are going to happen we&#39;re going to see
[205.239s] follow through with the
[209.84s] to see continued outperformance of small
[211.879s] caps versus large caps first 12 months
[214.36s] after a cut you get 11% outperformance
[216.72s] of small caps and everyone&#39;s loaded into
[219.68s] defensives I think we&#39;re going to move
[221.08s] back to Consumer discretionary over
[222.72s] consumer staples and that second regime
[225.04s] change was the fiscal stimulus bazooka
[227.64s] Emerging Markets now outperforming
[229.76s] developed markets with China on the tear
[232.2s] okay but you say Russell 2000 the small
[234.439s] and midcaps when you say the
[239.799s] UNM magnificent 493 and magnificent 7 so
[243.04s] UNM magnificent 493 will outperform
[245.079s] continue to outperform the Magnificent 7
[247.4s] which is Amazon Google meta Etc okay so
[251.12s] you&#39;re saying the rest of the S&amp;P is
[253.079s] much more magnificent it&#39;s much more
[254.879s] magnificent it&#39;s a c change that started
[257.32s] to take place in the last few weeks and
[258.88s] now accelerated with the 50 Bas oh
[260.919s] you&#39;re talking to Keith Fitzgerald and
[262.6s] he&#39;s been loving and making a lot of
[264.28s] money off Nvidia Keith um what&#39;s your
[266.52s] answer there to to what Tom&#39;s just said
[270.24s] I think that is just pure genius the
[276.039s] unmagnified credit of course I think
[278.84s] that Tech is not all the same Liz and so
[281.199s] as you know certain companies are going
[283.12s] to do better than others so Amazon&#39;s got
[284.96s] its challenges made has got his
[286.24s] challenges but companies like Nvidia for
[287.8s] example are going to run right back to
[289.84s] the front of the pack whether it&#39;s the
[291.24s] UNM magnificent or magnificent remains
[292.84s] to be seen but plenty of party starting
[295.8s] proposition here okay uh I got to get
[298.44s] your thought on Costco because because
[300.28s] while the official earning season has
[302.639s] not yet begun it begins in a week or so
[305.0s] with the big Banks Costco came out with
[307.759s] numbers what are you saying the analyst
[309.88s] got wrong that&#39;s sending the stock
[311.919s] lower well here&#39;s the thing right Costco
[314.16s] is one of those things you know trade
[315.24s] the nudes or trade the reality and the
[316.8s] reality situation is I&#39;m not sure they
[318.44s] were looking at the same report I was
[320.0s] because I saw sales up I saw earnings up
[322.28s] in the billions of dollars but the key
[324.84s] takeaway here is they didn&#39;t even glance
[326.84s] at this 50% of the new membership that
[329.84s] Costco is selling if to under 40 age
[332.039s] consumers that suggests to me there is
[334.319s] another group of costara in the blooming
[337.199s] that could power this thing for decades
[339.08s] to come the fact that it&#39;s down today is
[340.919s] purely a technical move and an
[342.479s] opportunity Tom&#39;s going to steal cost
[344.36s] karate so you guys will be you guys will
[346.639s] be even here U what&#39;s your counter to
[348.8s] that Tom I mean how do you feel about
[350.039s] the US economy we do obviously see that
[353.28s] inflation is moderating continuing to
[355.96s] moderate although the Core
[357.199s] year-over-year pce 2 .7 while it matched
[361.44s] it&#39;s still hotter than a year ago it
[363.919s] it&#39;s it&#39;s Goldilocks I mean things look
[366.039s] good the only thing I&#39;m a little worried
[367.36s] about by the way whenever Keith talks I
[369.24s] listen Keith is a good buddy of mine so
[371.12s] take a look at those names um the skew
[373.759s] option skew is the cost to ensure one
[376.4s] and two standard deviation d uh uh
[378.68s] Corrections is at 10year highs so it
[381.56s] doesn&#39;t mean you&#39;re automatically going
[382.8s] to get a correction but you know
[384.16s] pre-election volatility is pretty
[385.759s] typical going back to
[387.44s] 1955 in the in the month of October so
[390.4s] we are staying fully invested but if
[391.919s] you&#39;re on margin I would get off margin
[393.759s] we&#39;re going to write out these bumps and
[395.039s] then once the election clears we&#39;ll get
[396.4s] a yearend rally okay a yearend rally I&#39;m
[398.759s] wondering if that would include Keith
[400.56s] Intel Intel of course has been at the
[402.84s] center of individual stock headlines
[405.759s] this week and at the end of last week
[407.88s] Bloomberg&#39;s got a report the Wall Street
[409.479s] journal&#39;s got a report that you know
[411.12s] private Equity might come in and maybe
[413.56s] Qualcomm maybe who knows what arm but
[416.84s] but one thing that&#39;s been reported is
[419.199s] that
[420.28s] Intel&#39;s pretty much rebuffed a lot of
[423.12s] this you know I got to tell you Pat
[425.759s] gelsinger I&#39;ve met him several times is
[427.84s] as bright as they come he&#39;s the right
[429.28s] guy at the right time for that company
[430.84s] the problem why I mean he&#39;s lagging here
[433.039s] he&#39;s been at the helm for a couple of
[435.039s] years we like Pat to we like him too I
[437.8s] know but but you cannot turn a huge ship
[441.759s] on a dime the problem is the company has
[444.24s] missed mobile missed AI missed the cloud
[446.879s] missed a lot of things that are a lot of
[448.36s] years in the making so so I think
[450.319s] unfortunately Intel remains dead money I
[452.36s] don&#39;t know why they rebuffed these
[453.8s] offers because that could have been
[454.96s] salvation it seems to me that there&#39;s a
[457.36s] lot of blunt thinking inside their
[459.0s] headquarters right now and it&#39;s going to
[460.4s] be bad for shareholders okay well at
[462.96s] least for the week I see Intel up about
[466.08s] 88.7% uh guys give me your sense next
[469.28s] week as we Barrel toward what will be
[472.159s] the September jobs report it&#39;s really
[474.879s] become labor that&#39;s at the focus for the
[477.24s] FED is it not Tom yeah no question about
[479.72s] I I think that&#39;s where you could
[481.319s] potentially see some volatility you have
[483.319s] obviously the inflation numbers later in
[484.96s] the month but the jobs report is
[486.639s] critical and everyone&#39;s pretty happy
[488.4s] right now sentiment is still mixed you
[490.56s] know when I look for things to hedge or
[492.36s] short I found it very difficult to find
[494.599s] in the portfolio the only things that
[496.039s] were ready in my view that seemed
[497.599s] overvalued were utilities and Staples
[499.96s] which you don&#39;t want to short defensives
[501.36s] into a correction so I think uh let&#39;s
[503.879s] see what the labor numbers are things
[505.56s] look pretty solid don&#39;t expect we expect
[508.199s] a little bit of bumpiness in October but
[510.36s] again as long as we get gridlocked from
[511.879s] that election Liz we&#39;re going to be fine
[513.399s] into your end okay uh Keith we got to go
[515.719s] but Tom said listen to Keith&#39;s picks and
[519.2s] I will tell you that had our viewers
[521.76s] listened to you a couple of years ago
[524.0s] about one particular stock stay in it
[526.56s] stay in it stay in it they would have
[527.92s] made a lot of money and that is Palante
[530.16s] teer and we look at some of the gains
[532.6s] here uh it&#39;s it&#39;s quite unbelievable
[535.12s] hitting brand new records uh not
[537.48s] unbelievable because you&#39;ve been here
[539.44s] telling us about that where does the
[541.24s] stock go you&#39;re you&#39;re very kind to
[543.48s] remember that thank you I think we&#39;re
[544.44s] going to take out 50 pretty quickly I&#39;m
[545.959s] starting to think about 85 but three to
[547.68s] five years from now there&#39;s zero doubt
[549.04s] in my mind we&#39;re looking at a hundred
[550.64s] bucks a share so it&#39;s going to be
[552.32s] volatile going to be a tough stock to
[553.68s] own but I encourage people to stay with
[555.76s] it if you can yeah big Daya aggregator
[557.76s] great to see you both have a good
[559.68s] weekend gentlemen the maker of
[563.399s] O and we&#39;re back and then on Tuesday I
[567.48s] came into the uh is Israeli uh War
[571.48s] situation and the Port strike and talked
[573.8s] about that in real time with Stuart
[575.399s] vanney and Lauren Simonetti I want to
[577.92s] thank Christian dagger and Preston
[580.76s] miselle and obviously Stewart and Stuart
[583.959s] vanney and Lauren Simonetti uh and also
[587.72s] Liz Clayman as well for the previous one
[590.68s] so here we go please pull up the DOW
[592.56s] Industrials the smmp and the NASDAQ
[594.399s] please they&#39;re they&#39;re moving south that
[596.76s] is because the US has indications that
[599.6s] Iran is preparing to launch a ballistic
[601.92s] missile attack against Israel that would
[604.0s] be a very very serious development in
[606.2s] international relations an extension of
[608.32s] the war and we&#39;d like to know what our
[610.48s] response what America&#39;s response would
[612.24s] be if this happened I think that&#39;s
[614.32s] Weighing on the market now let&#39;s get
[616.12s] back to the dock strike uh 45,000
[618.64s] workers on strike Tom Hayes joins me uh
[621.2s] to watch the market for us do you expect
[623.48s] Biden to intervene within a week as I&#39;m
[625.519s] I&#39;m suggesting that in my opinion piece
[627.2s] there what do you say I absolutely agree
[629.12s] with you you Ste I think Biden&#39;s going
[630.6s] to intervene he just doesn&#39;t know it yet
[632.44s] because effectively the last thing you
[634.72s] want to see going into an election is
[637.16s] 401ks going down and the cost of eggs
[640.36s] and wood and all the supplies to North
[642.079s] Carolina going up this could be if they
[645.399s] fumble the ball the best thing that ever
[647.48s] happened to Donald Trump in terms of the
[649.76s] election because uh right now we
[652.88s] front-loaded a lot of shipping into the
[654.639s] East Coast so for the next week it&#39;s
[656.519s] only going to cost $34 billion after the
[658.76s] first week it could start to cost $4
[660.68s] billion a day people are going to feel
[663.04s] that and we&#39;re in a seasonally weak
[665.76s] period of the stock market as a matter
[667.399s] of fact in elections the next 10 days
[669.839s] election years since 1955 are the most
[672.24s] volatile and the lowest returns of the
[674.04s] year of an election year so you compound
[675.8s] that with Israel Iran you compound that
[678.2s] with the strike I think he comes in in a
[680.48s] week and a half and say if it&#39;s not
[682.04s] resolved beforehand and says we&#39;re going
[683.88s] to let this cool down to I don&#39;t know
[686.16s] sometime in
[687.399s] November well thank you right right but
[691.36s] so you are telling me that if the strike
[694.32s] lasts you know two weeks say the market
[697.88s] will take a hit regardless of what
[699.56s] President Biden does no question about
[701.72s] it yeah I think the Market&#39;s going to
[703.16s] start to extrapolate what that means uh
[705.76s] in terms of you know 50% of the port
[707.639s] shutting down can&#39;t get Goods Walmart&#39;s
[709.519s] going to be hit Home Depot&#39;s going to be
[711.32s] hit uh and then people will worry about
[713.92s] the holidays as well so uh certainly the
[716.16s] Public Public will even though a lot of
[717.639s] the holiday supply has come in by the
[720.0s] end of September uh as things run out as
[723.24s] Price look consumer confidence it&#39;s been
[725.16s] kind of dead on the mat why because
[726.92s] prices are up so prices start to tick up
[728.92s] again uh and they associate that with
[731.399s] the Harris Biden Administration uh it&#39;s
[733.88s] really going to bode well for Trump
[735.079s] going into the election I want to get
[736.56s] back to this breaking story the US has
[739.16s] indications that Iran is preparing to
[741.68s] launch a ballistic missile attack
[743.839s] against Israel I&#39;m saying that that is
[746.399s] part of the reason for the Market&#39;s
[747.92s] decline we&#39;re down 3 30 now on the DOW
[750.32s] Industrials is it a is it a big negative
[752.76s] for the overall Market I think so we had
[754.76s] indications of this headline uh midn
[756.959s] next mid last week and we saw this type
[759.72s] of volatility mid last week uh this is a
[762.44s] factor and you have to think about see
[764.04s] that on the screen right now uh the
[766.12s] yield on the 10-year treasury is down
[768.56s] that is the result of a flight to safety
[770.839s] that&#39;s people putting money into dead
[772.519s] safe 10year Treasures is that 10 yes it
[774.68s] is the 10 year forcing the price up and
[776.959s] the yield down right to safety that&#39;s my
[779.36s] opinion vix is up oil is up 3% oil is at
[782.079s] $70 a barrel I think on this breaking
[784.44s] store it&#39;s happening as we speak it&#39;s
[787.6s] interesting uh that last time I was on I
[790.88s] said if you&#39;re on margin come off margin
[793.32s] and the reason I said that is the skew
[795.72s] which is the price to ensure against a
[798.32s] one standard deviation correction think
[800.12s] of 10% correction hit 10year highs in
[804.04s] the last week that doesn&#39;t guarantee a
[807.079s] correction but it indicates that uh
[809.32s] we&#39;re fully invested but we&#39;re off of
[810.8s] margin we we&#39;ll write out these
[812.48s] short-term bumps through the election I
[813.959s] think we we&#39;ll do fine after the
[815.16s] election but you have to keep that in
[816.8s] mind uh we made a lot of money don&#39;t
[818.88s] borrow money to buy stocks it&#39;s not a
[820.48s] good not right now yes Tom Hayes good
[822.959s] stuff today thank you very much indeed
[825.519s] uh and we&#39;re back and here&#39;s the quote
[829.32s] of the week to buy when others are
[831.0s] despondently selling and sell when
[832.8s] others are euphorically buying takes the
[834.68s] greatest courage but provides the
[836.199s] greatest profit I can&#39;t tell you how
[838.759s] many of you uh came to me and um have
[844.399s] have uh expressed your gratitude for
[847.079s] hanging in there and buying in the hole
[848.72s] when no one was and we were buying every
[850.36s] single week it was red and now you guys
[852.759s] have made a ton of money uh Damian new
[856.24s] buddy out in uh Santa Monica same story
[860.639s] uh started in the hundreds brought his
[862.32s] basis all the way down to the mid 80s
[864.639s] also and uh and he&#39;s smiling so wi he
[867.56s] could eat a banana sideways and all
[869.279s] great emails very grateful but you did
[871.36s] it you stuck in there you did the work
[874.0s] and uh and now you know this thing will
[876.079s] run up everyone will want to buy it at
[878.079s] you know 120 and then we&#39;ll consolidate
[880.519s] for a little while and everyone will say
[882.16s] oh it&#39;s just another fake out and
[883.68s] that&#39;ll be your final opportunity before
[885.6s] takeoff so uh very excited on that front
[888.88s] as great and most incredible as things
[891.079s] are rocking and rolling uh just want to
[893.639s] keep in mind that uh we&#39;re just getting
[896.12s] started as Walt Disney would say cuz
[898.56s] most of our great picks are just now
[901.48s] beginning to leave the station you know
[903.6s] Baba as much as it&#39;s moved 70% off the
[906.16s] lows in a handful of minutes uh you know
[909.44s] this will consolidate and this will work
[911.04s] higher there&#39;s no question about it uh
[913.44s] Baxter same thing it&#39;s moved a lot from
[916.0s] 32 to 40 but again just getting started
[919.04s] this thing&#39;s going to work higher over
[920.32s] the next few years with the turnaround
[921.959s] plan two billion dollars of cost out of
[924.199s] the business um
[927.279s] $13 reducing cost they did they did what
[930.16s] they said they were going to do as far
[931.319s] as selling deleveraging doing all the
[933.44s] plans CPS we just got great Auto Sales
[936.36s] in September up from 151 run rate in
[940.24s] August to 157 in September and that&#39;s
[943.079s] before the cuts and incentives even
[944.519s] start into year end so very excited
[946.399s] about that my goodness it would have
[948.839s] been the best quarter of ever uh it
[952.639s] might have been but uh might have been
[954.72s] the best quarter of ever um uh if you
[958.12s] had CPS also but I think CPS is going to
[960.04s] be the fourth quarter story which we&#39;re
[961.519s] very excited about Disney I can&#39;t tell
[964.199s] you how crowded the parks were and how
[966.079s] amazing the experience was nothing to
[968.319s] think about there they&#39;re raising the
[969.68s] prices at uh Disney plus people have to
[973.079s] have Disney if they have children if
[974.519s] they don&#39;t Social Services comes in and
[976.36s] takes your children away that thing is
[978.319s] Off to the Races gener same story sad
[982.12s] story for the people in Florida I hope
[983.8s] everyone is doing well um uh managing
[987.24s] through it but this demand is going to
[988.92s] continue to increase and increase with
[990.48s] the unstable grid and electricity demand
[992.839s] Intel opportunity of a lifetime we
[995.079s] bought in the High Teens as it flushed
[996.88s] out we&#39;ll probably buy some more if it
[998.8s] goes back and retests small caps just
[1001.48s] working their way higher I think this is
[1003.519s] again a fourth quarter story after the
[1005.399s] election like it usually is November
[1007.24s] December favors small caps and that&#39;s
[1009.839s] when we break to new highs which is
[1011.519s] pretty exciting as you know we got rid
[1014.04s] of the big Banks over the summer took
[1015.72s] profits uh but we kept our regionals
[1018.24s] this is going to work higher with small
[1019.8s] caps over time and to new highs we&#39;re
[1021.92s] excited about that PayPal rocketing off
[1025.16s] the bottom from 50 to 80 however it&#39;s
[1028.28s] just getting started ladies and
[1029.88s] gentlemen yes it&#39;s a huge move and yes
[1032.16s] it&#39;ll consolidate and yes it will work
[1034.88s] higher this is a huge position for us as
[1036.919s] well as Baba uh Stanley black and&amp; deck
[1039.48s] are breaking out here from this
[1040.88s] consolidation range it&#39;ll consolidate
[1042.76s] and work higher to new highs over the
[1044.36s] next few years this is the most exciting
[1047.199s] time ever to be involved in markets and
[1049.96s] picking stocks because this once in a
[1052.32s] 100 year uh situation with Co created
[1055.799s] the most incredible amazing opportunity
[1058.32s] that&#39;s slipping away from us by the way
[1060.12s] if you don&#39;t get new money in uh you
[1062.4s] know in the next couple of quarters uh
[1064.52s] you can still do well but but the
[1066.919s] wholesale opportunities that are still
[1068.84s] out there yes they&#39;re moving up and yes
[1071.12s] we are uh super excited about that but
[1073.44s] we want everyone on the train with us to
[1075.72s] take full
[1076.84s] advantage and um uh it&#39;s it&#39;s
[1079.88s] unbelievable because you know in the
[1081.559s] case of Baba it&#39;s like yeah yo so you
[1083.36s] bring your basis all the way down to the
[1084.76s] low 80s and then you know boom it shoots
[1087.64s] up to 115 but the options we had it&#39;s
[1090.919s] it&#39;s staggering what&#39;s happening with
[1092.88s] some of these four five 6X 7x and taking
[1096.0s] a little bit of uh WIS on those that
[1098.52s] expire in January it&#39;s unbelievable and
[1101.76s] um and VF Corp VF little little old VF
[1105.28s] Corp is now knocking on the door 20 we
[1107.159s] haven&#39;t even had a time to talk about it
[1109.559s] it&#39;s up from 10 to 20 and no one is even
[1112.0s] paying attention to it I love this stuff
[1114.88s] uh biotech also starting to break out I
[1117.679s] mean it&#39;s been all of this stuff and
[1119.679s] remember we kept saying wait till the
[1121.039s] FED Cuts wait till the fed well it&#39;s
[1122.48s] here ladies and gentlemen small caps
[1124.12s] China biotech small capat the the whole
[1127.48s] thing is playing out according to plan
[1130.28s] let&#39;s talk about some of the data for
[1131.799s] the week consecutive weekly declines in
[1133.88s] US 30-year mortgage rate uh eight weekly
[1137.44s] declines this is going to continue I
[1140.08s] think we&#39;ll see
[1142.159s] a it went from 7.2 to
[1146.84s] 6.12 I think we will see a high five
[1149.4s] handle maybe by the end of the year
[1151.4s] certainly by first quarter and that&#39;s
[1153.08s] going to ignite the housing market which
[1155.799s] will benefit uh further benefit Stanley
[1158.44s] Black and&amp; Decker further benefit um JRA
[1162.4s] and others gaval put this out over the
[1165.08s] last two decades China has had five big
[1167.4s] Equity rallies three of which have been
[1168.96s] fueled by stimulus we could be at the
[1170.64s] beginning of a fourth stimulus rally
[1172.32s] which raises expectations of 50 to 100%
[1174.76s] gains it&#39;s so interesting to see all the
[1178.12s] groups that were excessively negative on
[1180.72s] China and bearish now that they&#39;re up
[1183.4s] you know 50 70% a lot of these stocks
[1185.96s] off the bottom in a matter of weeks uh
[1188.36s] they&#39;re all saying uh they&#39;re excited
[1190.24s] and just getting started and uh so they
[1192.32s] were telling people to sell 50% ago and
[1195.24s] now they&#39;re telling them to buy which
[1196.76s] means we probably consolidate at some
[1198.32s] point in the next few weeks and then um
[1201.679s] uh punish all the ones chasing at you
[1204.32s] know 120 130 and um uh and then they&#39;ll
[1208.84s] sell back at 110 and and and um and then
[1212.0s] it&#39;ll take up take back off to 150 so we
[1214.799s] covered that last week uh HSI shares has
[1218.36s] triggered its strongest breath advance
[1220.52s] in history a classic bull market
[1222.36s] initiation signal so that&#39;s good news
[1225.0s] the cost of bearish bets slumps as China
[1227.559s] stocks rally
[1230.0s] Global monetary easing September saw the
[1232.44s] biggest month of easing since April of
[1234.28s] 2020 this is something we&#39;ve been
[1235.919s] talking about for months that&#39;s playing
[1237.44s] out if you did you want to be a buyer or
[1240.12s] seller uh when this type of easing
[1242.24s] happened in the first quarter of 2020
[1244.88s] you wanted to be a buyer and we were go
[1246.72s] back to the podcast tapes we were one of
[1248.64s] the few and it was one of the biggest
[1250.36s] most incredible years ever uh and then
[1253.6s] um uh 2009 same story so that that&#39;s
[1257.559s] that this is shows the seasonality of
[1260.559s] the first 10 days of October in an
[1262.28s] election presidential election year from
[1264.159s] 1928 this is the most
[1266.36s] volatile um a negative uh period of the
[1270.24s] Year doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;ll uh necessarily
[1272.679s] repeat but uh it&#39;s nice that uh we we
[1275.96s] built up some cash we sold Centum in the
[1279.24s] last couple of weeks we sold um and we
[1282.039s] took a lot of uh profits across a slew
[1284.919s] of options that were up four five 6 7x
[1287.44s] spreads Etc
[1289.159s] and um and uh and now and then after the
[1293.08s] first 10 days you move into a more
[1294.559s] favorable period and then following the
[1296.039s] election straight up that&#39;s a positive
[1298.76s] thing
[1300.88s] uh okay so this is talking about if the
[1303.64s] market does well from July through
[1306.24s] October then the existing party stays in
[1310.44s] power if it does poorly the new party
[1313.32s] gets in power that makes sense we&#39;ll see
[1315.84s] how it plays out this time there&#39;s this
[1317.799s] consumer conf confidence factor and as I
[1320.679s] said on vanney if they fumble the strike
[1324.039s] and and stock prices 401K start to go
[1326.48s] down and prices start to go up uh that
[1329.64s] could change the whole Dynamics if they
[1332.12s] get to it quickly you know it&#39;s it&#39;s
[1335.48s] probably um we&#39;ll we&#39;ll see how it plays
[1338.2s] out but uh I think as it stands the
[1340.52s] Republicans will get the Senate the
[1342.279s] Democrats probably get the house and the
[1345.0s] presidency is a coin flip based on what
[1347.48s] happens in the next few weeks weeks uh
[1349.679s] economic surprise Index this is turning
[1351.88s] up that&#39;s what you see in expansions not
[1354.08s] contractions median floor area decreased
[1356.919s] remember we&#39;ve been covering this for
[1358.24s] three years we said not every starter
[1360.44s] home needs to be 5,000 square foot with
[1362.679s] an indoor pool uh that you know people
[1365.64s] can actually have a th000 and 2,000
[1367.72s] square foot homes and like they did in
[1370.6s] um I think levit town in the 50s that&#39;s
[1372.559s] starting to play out that&#39;s going to
[1373.84s] allow a lot more people into the starter
[1376.039s] home land which is a good thing uh long
[1379.52s] dated US Treasury returns near 62- we
[1382.2s] lows so we&#39;ve had that huge rally off
[1383.679s] the bottom I think that&#39;s going to
[1385.08s] consolidate for a while
[1390.799s] um uh us large cap 10year rolling
[1394.279s] returns well above historical average I
[1396.48s] think that&#39;s overdone a little bit give
[1398.52s] small caps a chance give Emerging
[1400.72s] Markets Emerging Markets outperform
[1402.52s] developed which we covered on Liz uh
[1405.559s] small small greater than large
[1409.24s] um small greater than
[1414.52s] large Emerging Markets greater than
[1418.4s] developed markets value over growth
[1427.36s] unmagnify over Consumer Staples that&#39;s
[1429.96s] those are the themes going forward China
[1432.2s] msci earnings per
[1434.44s] share um trading at uh forward p ps is
[1439.32s] 6.5 times it&#39;s
[1441.6s] unbelievable and uh this
[1445.36s] is uh just showing at the bottom of the
[1447.799s] range msci profit margins are going up
[1450.919s] in the last two years not down this is
[1452.96s] msci China by the way this is all from
[1455.24s] yardeni uh valuation multiple again High
[1458.2s] single digit still even after this rally
[1460.76s] which is super exciting here is a list
[1462.679s] of draw downs from Wisdom Tree Russell
[1465.679s] still trading below we like Russ small
[1468.96s] caps Russell 2000 and Emerging Markets
[1471.6s] these are your two big money
[1473.559s] opportunities ladies and gentlemen for
[1475.2s] the next 18 months that&#39;s going to
[1477.2s] continue I love I can&#39;t stop posting
[1479.72s] this chart uh with China short China
[1482.88s] equities was one of the most crowded
[1485.32s] trades for the last few months uh that
[1488.52s] they can&#39;t even get out of their shorts
[1490.36s] it&#39;s I mean could you imagine these guys
[1492.12s] are upside down 100% in a matter of
[1494.399s] weeks you&#39;re going to see a lot of them
[1495.799s] blow up the people that have been short
[1498.159s] and and um and that&#39;s the story Emerging
[1501.2s] Markets versus developed markets
[1502.559s] performance you can see it here hockey
[1504.159s] stick straight up cyclicals versus
[1506.399s] defensive starting to pick up now uh
[1509.039s] everyone crowded into defensives ahead
[1510.88s] of the cut we covered the economic
[1512.919s] surprise index here&#39;s the composition of
[1515.0s] S&amp;P Equity capitalization you can see
[1517.279s] Tech at 32% but they&#39;re only 21% of the
[1520.48s] earnings so that&#39;s why we say large cap
[1522.76s] underperforms or magnificent 7even
[1524.6s] underperforms un magnificent 493 you can
[1527.679s] see sector by sector I think uh an
[1530.44s] interesting story here would
[1533.84s] be uh financials at 21% of the earnings
[1537.08s] and 133% of the weight so that uh speaks
[1540.559s] to the small cap uh that speaks to the
[1544.919s] um uh um Regional Bank index that we we
[1550.32s] still hold here is from Bank of America
[1552.72s] S&amp;P divides gravity in seasonally
[1555.08s] weakest month so that was September uh
[1557.919s] strongest Q3 since 2020 marked by a big
[1561.279s] rotation equal weight S&amp;P jumped
[1565.36s] 99.4% versus the cap weighted S&amp;P five
[1569.039s] 5.5 what does that mean UNM magnificent
[1571.799s] 493 outperformed magnificent 7 which has
[1575.44s] been our theme for weeks and weeks and
[1577.88s] weeks we&#39;ve been talking about this it&#39;s
[1579.799s] played out 67% of the stocks in the S&amp;P
[1582.72s] 500 outperformed the index in Q3 998th
[1586.36s] percentile in history his ly only 31% of
[1589.559s] the stocks in the S&amp;P ever outperform
[1592.279s] the index value over growth for the
[1594.72s] first quarter since fourth quarter of
[1596.679s] 2022 dividend shine midcaps break out of
[1600.039s] the middle of the to lead September
[1602.799s] midcaps were up uh let&#39;s see like wrest
[1608.679s] after leaving the
[1610.399s] corter okay so midcaps are taking off
[1612.799s] stocks you don&#39;t pick make all of the
[1615.76s] difference uh so 69% outperform this
[1619.0s] quarter which is exciting and then
[1622.76s] indices so this is interesting I
[1625.159s] highlighted energy because it&#39;s doing so
[1627.76s] poorly uh energy and materials are two
[1630.6s] areas I&#39;ve got my eyes on as it relates
[1632.399s] to energy we have com stock we think
[1634.279s] that&#39;s going to work higher that&#39;s
[1635.36s] plenty but we are looking at some of
[1637.36s] we&#39;re not looking at the integrated
[1639.0s] they&#39;re not cheap enough for us uh we
[1641.32s] are looking at some of the servicers we
[1643.919s] may have more to say about that in
[1645.64s] coming weeks but for now we have nothing
[1647.679s] to say
[1648.679s] uh materials we&#39;re looking in that space
[1650.48s] we have a small position we&#39;ve talked
[1652.2s] about in albamar that&#39;s starting to take
[1654.039s] off uh off the mat uh but nothing um
[1658.64s] there but that&#39;s an area that we&#39;re
[1659.84s] starting to spend more time looking at
[1662.32s] and then
[1665.24s] um index relative price return
[1667.76s] distribution analysis so yeah you can
[1669.799s] see energy and materials have
[1670.96s] underperformed so we think that&#39;s going
[1672.24s] to be the story maybe late this year and
[1674.2s] certainly next year Healthcare a lot of
[1676.0s] opportunities biotech is going to work
[1677.44s] higher raising materials to overweight
[1679.76s] from Market weight again that&#39;s from
[1681.24s] Bank of America because of China
[1683.6s] stimulus because fed cutting in F
[1686.88s] cutting into an accelerating profit
[1688.559s] cycle means reflation long onlys are
[1691.679s] underweight materials a decade of
[1693.96s] underinvestment in manufacturing we&#39;re
[1695.96s] seeing that construction manufacturing
[1697.519s] start to take off Dr copper is turning
[1700.279s] up and new household formation is next
[1703.559s] because why engagement recovery is
[1705.919s] happening searches for engagement rings
[1707.64s] are up significantly in recent months
[1709.64s] according to Signet CEO dros on
[1712.6s] September 12th this makes sense to
[1714.279s] Lorraine Hutchinson uh typical
[1716.399s] three-year cycle of meet date engagement
[1718.96s] was stalled by covid but likely
[1721.2s] recovered by
[1722.6s] 2021 new household formation generally
[1725.36s] follows which is linked to materials
[1727.88s] returns new housing formation materials
[1729.72s] so we want to take advantage
[1731.279s] underinvestment in structure tangible
[1733.44s] cap capex since 1990 that&#39;s starting to
[1736.36s] pick back up um materials trades below
[1739.2s] its historical premium so again we want
[1741.519s] to look let me make another note to
[1743.559s] myself find some action in materials
[1746.159s] find some action in oil
[1748.76s] servicers and uh we&#39;ll see how uh the
[1752.519s] opportunity presents itself in coming
[1754.519s] weeks Bank
[1756.559s] of America analyst positive in the last
[1759.88s] three months on Industrials and
[1762.08s] materials so do they&#39;re doing more
[1763.559s] upgrades than downgrades uh sectors that
[1766.279s] do well uh after the first cut looking
[1770.159s] out healthc care is W so that biotech
[1772.919s] that we have is going to be phenomenal
[1775.519s] and we&#39;re going to get paid just like
[1778.279s] Baba for waiting and we&#39;re going to get
[1780.6s] paid bigly as they say uh biggest
[1783.679s] relative overweight in defensive versus
[1785.64s] cyclical since May TW 20 this is what
[1788.84s] we&#39;ve been talking about that&#39;s started
[1790.159s] to change
[1792.24s] now the discretionary are outperforming
[1795.48s] the Staples I think we&#39;ll we&#39;ll have
[1797.6s] some opport opportunities in uh October
[1800.559s] to pick some up on the cheap which is
[1801.96s] why we&#39;ve raised some cash which we&#39;re
[1803.84s] excited about uh and risk appetite is at
[1806.76s] 11-month low so dips are to be bought
[1808.76s] people are still skeptical then you&#39;ve
[1810.36s] also got tax loss harvesting brace for
[1812.679s] Red October uh tax loss harvesting from
[1815.84s] institutional investors became
[1817.08s] increasingly prevalent after the tax
[1818.559s] reform act in 1986 which mandated
[1820.96s] October 31st as the cut off for most
[1822.72s] mutual funds to realize capital
[1824.84s] gains tax loss selling by institutional
[1827.44s] investors October is also empirically
[1829.2s] borne out by flows and performance since
[1831.84s] 1986 stocks down 10% or more as of
[1834.24s] September month end have consistently
[1836.039s] lagged the S&amp;P in October by an average
[1838.2s] of 85 basis points and a stable ended
[1840.519s] performance hit rate of 63% before
[1842.72s] November&#39;s bounceback we screen for S&amp;P
[1846.12s] stocks down over 10% year-to date
[1848.84s] underweight by long only and they go
[1850.88s] through a bunch of lists so um US stocks
[1854.24s] that can this is not that list this is a
[1856.36s] different list first US stocks that can
[1858.08s] benefit from a rally in Chinese equities
[1860.399s] for those of you who are scared to own
[1862.679s] China equities and missed out on all
[1864.84s] this what comes to the to the top of the
[1866.96s] list J Estee louder and Stanley Black
[1870.72s] and&amp; Decker so we&#39;re getting two three
[1872.679s] bites at the Apple US Stocks with sales
[1875.24s] exposure to China uh that are going to
[1877.88s] benefit Qualcomm is interesting I
[1879.48s] wouldn&#39;t mind seeing the Qualcomm Intel
[1881.2s] I don&#39;t think it&#39;s going to come
[1882.32s] together I&#39;d probably buy Qualcomm
[1884.279s] discreetly but Intel is a better deal
[1886.279s] for me uh but if they came came together
[1888.44s] I would hold hoddle till the cows come
[1890.88s] home um other companies that uh have
[1895.6s] sales exposure to China I China recovers
[1898.279s] they&#39;ll benefit Las Vegas
[1900.12s] Sands
[1902.2s] um
[1904.08s] Intel uh let&#39;s see
[1908.32s] here APD I want to look at that one eBay
[1911.6s] I didn&#39;t realize that that&#39;s interesting
[1913.279s] Starbucks obviously Nike
[1916.039s] Lululemon um
[1919.039s] wi Resorts obviously all right dividends
[1922.08s] likely to contribute more to Total
[1923.559s] returns during than during the last
[1924.96s] decade we&#39;ve covered this dividend
[1926.679s] payers are dividend yield is still
[1928.88s] inexpensive relative to history it
[1930.32s] hasn&#39;t been this cheap since 2001 this
[1932.88s] goes back to our repeated analog 2002 to
[1935.96s] 2007 hedge funds exposure to cyclical
[1938.24s] versus defensives is just off an
[1940.44s] all-time low which is why you want to
[1942.0s] own cyclicals they&#39;ve been underweight
[1943.88s] they will be chasing up just like
[1945.24s] they&#39;re chasing in China and late to the
[1947.639s] park
[1948.679s] and then long and short the longest and
[1951.96s] shortest sectors the shortest is
[1957.0s] energy um so again I think we&#39;re going
[1960.44s] to see some opportunity there hedge
[1962.12s] funds have the highest relative exposure
[1964.76s] versus the S&amp;P to industrial&#39;s lowest to
[1967.24s] energy so again energy there&#39;s got to be
[1968.919s] a pony in that pile we have com stock
[1971.44s] we&#39;re going to probably out a serer and
[1974.039s] uh we&#39;ll take it from there Commodities
[1975.76s] 10year rolling returns uh ju yes it&#39;s at
[1979.24s] 10e Highs but it&#39;s coming like off
[1981.48s] depression death from 2000 and a long
[1985.159s] way to run in that
[1987.6s] story
[1989.799s] um fund manager survey underweight
[1992.36s] resources Commodities Emerging Markets
[1994.6s] versus history they&#39;re going to have to
[1995.88s] play catchup so energy again
[1999.84s] Industrials um Emerging Markets what do
[2003.039s] they overweight
[2005.12s] utilities uh so you know we&#39;ve talked
[2007.84s] about utilities uh no one wanted them in
[2009.639s] October when we were pounding the table
[2011.799s] uh last year and everyone wants them up
[2013.519s] 50 60% now we think that&#39;s going to a
[2015.84s] little bit long in the tooth as to
[2017.679s] consolidate those gains jobless claims
[2019.399s] sync to four-month low businesses aren&#39;t
[2021.279s] hiring or firing many people maau Hotel
[2024.039s] occupancy rate back to pre pandemic
[2026.32s] levels this is a big big deal that&#39;s a
[2029.159s] indicative of China consumer and VIPs
[2032.08s] and the wealthy feeling better about
[2033.72s] things energy sector versus the S&amp;P
[2036.08s] broke this downtrend I most technical
[2038.399s] analysts say this is terrible this is
[2040.24s] bad I think this is still uh I think
[2042.679s] this is representing an opportunity
[2044.72s] retail continues to have significant
[2046.639s] size bias in favor of large over smid
[2049.76s] smid and M cap uh that&#39;s exactly what
[2052.96s] you want to take the opposite side is
[2054.76s] retail chases the large cap uh the
[2057.2s] nvidias ETC and uh the opportuni is
[2060.24s] going to be in the small and mid and
[2062.599s] already is uh consumer sentiment
[2064.879s] starting to tick back up this Port
[2066.76s] strike will see how it&#39;s handled could
[2069.159s] could take it back down uh temporarily
[2072.0s] manufacturing and Warehouse construction
[2074.079s] going through the roof in line with our
[2076.079s] themes we&#39;ve been talking about
[2077.839s] construction spending is now ticking
[2079.679s] back up uh Stanley gener Etc we&#39;ve been
[2083.679s] positioned for that job openings are
[2085.639s] ticking back up that&#39;s a good sign
[2088.0s] probably because of the rate cut and uh
[2090.639s] some positive outlook there job openings
[2092.8s] monthly change the biggest ad is been in
[2097.079s] construction
[2098.44s] and food services and local government
[2100.96s] excluding education manufacturing we
[2104.04s] covered that uh GDP now estimates for Q3
[2107.92s] are at
[2110.16s] 2.5% economic surprise index Just Hockey
[2113.2s] sticking up that&#39;s what you see in
[2114.599s] expansions not contraction ports
[2116.76s] affected by the strike handle about 25%
[2119.32s] of total us Goods Imports 2.8% of GDP
[2122.92s] and 27% of total us good exports 1.9% of
[2126.76s] GDP so it&#39;s not it&#39;s totally material
[2130.0s] it&#39;s not completely devastating it&#39;s
[2131.72s] going to be a key of time they can let
[2134.2s] it go for a week because uh they already
[2136.56s] front loaded all the shipping to the
[2138.2s] West Coast and to the east coast ahead
[2140.119s] of this deadline but after a week it&#39;s
[2142.28s] going to start to cost four or five
[2143.68s] billion a day and then you&#39;re going to
[2145.4s] see the pain in the Walmarts the Ikeas
[2147.56s] the Samsungs Bob&#39;s Discount Furniture
[2149.96s] Home Depot Etc we covered this last week
[2152.72s] head fund billionaire David teer says
[2154.4s] he&#39;s loading up on China stocks after
[2156.079s] the nation stimulus bazooka so after
[2158.079s] they&#39;re up 50 60% but he also had Baba
[2161.56s] as his number one position in recent
[2163.4s] quarters so welcome to the party Intel
[2166.52s] and US race to finalize 8.5 billion in
[2169.52s] chips funding by Year&#39;s End uh that is
[2172.319s] going to
[2174.44s] continue um uh and be a very positive
[2179.04s] thing for Intel moving
[2182.359s] forward
[2184.48s] um moving on China&#39;s poet burrow super
[2188.2s] supercharges stimulus with housing rate
[2190.2s] valves Etc so they did the rates they
[2192.24s] lowered the mortgage rates uh on
[2194.52s] trillions Yuan of mortgages they did the
[2198.119s] uh Bond issuance for a quarter trillion
[2200.44s] dollars of fiscal stimulus and it&#39;s just
[2202.64s] beginning they keep saying we&#39;ll do more
[2204.28s] we&#39;ll do more we&#39;ll do more and uh the
[2206.56s] market is finally believing them because
[2208.8s] they are doing what they say they&#39;re
[2210.28s] going to do
[2212.48s] um next hedge funds snap up Chinese
[2215.04s] equities on stimulus optimism uh add to
[2218.319s] that after up 50% China&#39;s Yuan continues
[2221.56s] upward climb after Beijing stimulus
[2223.44s] rollout so all the late money that&#39;s
[2225.72s] come in will have to get punished a
[2227.56s] little bit U my guess is we push maybe a
[2230.56s] little bit higher and then bang them out
[2232.72s] 101 15% let them sell in the hole again
[2235.88s] and then just run it up uh parabolically
[2238.24s] probably into year end and uh and the
[2240.96s] first quarter hang sang and China
[2243.319s] internet outperforming the S&amp;P year-to
[2245.56s] date that&#39;s funny China is now out
[2247.68s] performing the S&amp;P year-to date pretty
[2250.44s] wild alibaba&#39;s AI powered cancer
[2252.76s] detection tool recognized on Fortune uh
[2255.599s] 2024 Change the World list uh is the
[2259.359s] Japanese Yen reversing upward the answer
[2262.599s] is yes ladies and gentlemen we&#39;ve been
[2264.599s] calling for that for months hedging goes
[2267.599s] out the door with burst of China stock
[2269.8s] Euphoria opinion follows Trend ladies
[2272.16s] and gentlemen uh there&#39;s David terer
[2274.68s] Central Bank comments exceeded
[2276.56s] expectations
[2278.079s] those calling Intel a company in Decline
[2280.16s] are missing the point entirely it&#39;s now
[2282.72s] a corporate actor on the geopolitical
[2286.68s] stage uh recent narrative coverage
[2289.44s] narrative uh the sad decline of a once-
[2291.64s] great American company continue to
[2293.24s] Outlook dim but the story is really a
[2295.319s] high stakes Thriller leading to an
[2297.119s] uncertain resolution that could carry
[2298.52s] Global implication may take years to
[2300.2s] play out but seeing the big picture
[2301.48s] takes each day&#39;s news far more
[2303.76s] interesting um
[2308.44s] they do the
[2313.56s] backstory inel today virgin story most
[2317.24s] interest okay the most interesting part
[2320.04s] the grand strategy great Powers
[2322.24s] geopolitics element semiconductors are
[2324.56s] crucial uh for both America&#39;s and
[2326.48s] China&#39;s national security only three
[2328.119s] companies can make leading extra chips
[2329.88s] Taiwan semiconductor Samsung and Intel
[2332.599s] which ranks in a distant third in output
[2334.2s] that&#39;s why bipartisan Congressional
[2335.88s] majorities in 2022 passed the chips and
[2337.839s] science acts which subsidizes new chip
[2340.0s] factories in America uh Gina romond in
[2342.56s] February explained why we cannot allow
[2344.119s] ourselves to be overly riant on one part
[2346.839s] of the world for the most important
[2348.359s] piece of Hardware in the 21st
[2350.359s] century
[2351.41s] [Music]
[2353.359s] um so effectively what this article is
[2356.359s] telling you is what I&#39;ve been saying for
[2358.44s] months which is oh by the way here&#39;s
[2361.04s] what&#39;s
[2361.88s] interesting uh quote I fully expect that
[2364.64s] we&#39;ll need a chips act too so they&#39;re
[2366.64s] going to get more more money why because
[2368.72s] they&#39;re the only game in town so Taiwan
[2371.839s] semiconductor uh is is not the region
[2374.24s] they want to fund Samsung is not the
[2375.92s] region they fund Intel is the only one
[2377.92s] that can produce these and they&#39;ve
[2379.599s] actually just started delivering their
[2381.88s] gouty 3 chip uh which we&#39;ve covered many
[2385.079s] times and the government will continue
[2387.079s] to stand behind them because it&#39;s a ma
[2389.119s] matter of National Security top shell
[2391.4s] boss says us unusually vulnerable to
[2393.56s] Middle East oil shock I think the the
[2395.839s] stage is set with everyone so
[2397.96s] pessimistic they all wanted energy
[2399.599s] stocks at the top no one wanted them at
[2401.16s] the bottom in 2020 when we were buying
[2403.0s] everyone wanted them at the top in
[2405.48s] 2023 uh and now they&#39;re pessimistic
[2408.359s] again I think that creates opportunity
[2410.079s] Chinese home buyers Scout showrooms
[2411.92s] after midnight at midnight after easing
[2414.319s] so the minute the policy stepped
[2417.48s] in the Chinese are back to what they
[2419.96s] love to do which is by real estate and
[2423.16s] uh and the game is back on and it was
[2425.48s] just a question of how long it took them
[2426.92s] to cry uncle they took about 12 months
[2429.56s] more than we anticipated but it forced
[2432.16s] us to buy a ton more stock at lower
[2434.2s] prices so the Christmas card is in the
[2436.2s] mail to xiin Ping Boeing stock Rose
[2439.16s] despite effort saying a uh a share
[2442.28s] offering is coming so they got to raise
[2443.88s] about 10 billion of equity somewhat
[2446.16s] deluded probably already priced in uh
[2449.319s] but once they turn the spets back on and
[2451.4s] the cash flow goes they&#39;ll just buy that
[2453.24s] stock in uh and what that does is it
[2456.16s] saves their credit rating and gives them
[2458.319s] a little bit more leverage because at
[2459.64s] the end of the day with all these
[2461.44s] strikes as strong as they are and as as
[2464.079s] organized as they are at the end of the
[2466.319s] day workers run out of money and they
[2467.839s] blink and uh you know I don&#39;t mean to
[2471.72s] sound callous I&#39;m telling you how this
[2474.72s] works out the company can raise 10
[2476.48s] billion doar the workers can&#39;t and um so
[2479.839s] sooner or later they&#39;re going to come to
[2481.2s] a reasonable solution I mean I think
[2483.0s] what&#39;s on the table with Boeing was up
[2484.68s] 30% in Pay what&#39;s on you know the the uh
[2487.88s] long shoremen are already making
[2489.56s] $150,000 a year to load packages
[2492.599s] interesting enough if you go to China
[2495.28s] all of these ports are completely
[2496.839s] automated they have these automated
[2498.68s] elevators that take the cargo container
[2501.44s] off the ship it goes on a truck that has
[2503.68s] an autonomous driver that takes the
[2506.04s] stuff where it needs to go I mean you
[2507.72s] can&#39;t make this stuff up so you know no
[2510.76s] one likes change we all have to deal
[2512.56s] with it um I think that Boeing will come
[2516.079s] to a reasonable solution like the UAW
[2518.359s] and the car makers did but
[2524.079s] um eventually these things get resolved
[2527.64s] because people have their rent doesn&#39;t
[2530.079s] stop coming in their cell phone bill
[2532.839s] doesn&#39;t stop coming in their car payment
[2534.56s] doesn&#39;t stop coming in and usually it&#39;s
[2536.52s] about at a month of savings that most of
[2538.839s] the workers have and then everyone
[2540.319s] blinks and wants to vote so that&#39;s where
[2542.44s] it comes they&#39;ll get more they should
[2544.24s] get more prices have gone up but like
[2546.319s] some of the requests
[2548.079s] uh on both sides you know they get
[2550.24s] everyone starts with a big ask and then
[2551.839s] they come to a deal that neither party
[2553.64s] likes and that&#39;s the sign of a good deal
[2555.16s] when no one&#39;s happy the workers won&#39;t be
[2557.0s] perfectly happy the company won&#39;t be
[2558.48s] work perfectly happy they&#39;ll have given
[2560.48s] more money than they wanted to the
[2562.0s] workers have will have gotten
[2565.319s] uh probably slightly less than they
[2567.44s] wanted to and everyone goes home and and
[2570.359s] uh everything gets back to normal China
[2572.4s] retail investors scramble back to the
[2574.0s] stock market I don&#39;t want to miss the
[2575.48s] boat there you go that&#39;s everything you
[2577.8s] need to know ADP jobs report shows
[2580.16s] 143,000 gain Cooling in US Labor Market
[2582.4s] leads to slower wage
[2584.079s] increases um next from Pearl Harbor to
[2588.119s] September 11th here&#39;s how to stocks
[2589.96s] typically react to outbreak of
[2592.16s] Wars so you can see here in the first
[2595.599s] day uh you get mostly negative uh and
[2599.119s] then the to Total draw down range is
[2601.24s] between 0% to 19% I think we&#39;ll have
[2604.68s] some mid single digits in October here
[2607.44s] and uh they&#39;ll try to shore it up before
[2609.559s] the election one way or another and then
[2612.04s] China rally Spurs 7 billion doll loss
[2614.52s] for shorts of us listed stocks um
[2617.92s] world&#39;s smallest crocodile tiers for
[2620.24s] that and uh moving
[2624.4s] on here&#39;s the article of the week sell
[2626.88s] Rush hosana buy yam kapor question mark
[2630.119s] So Rush hosana starts today it ends uh
[2634.0s] it goes to yam kapor which is on the
[2636.04s] 11th this is historically a seasonally
[2638.64s] weak period we uh going back to the
[2642.16s] notes on um for the shows that I was on
[2646.0s] we didn&#39;t get to cover all of that you
[2647.319s] can go through these notes but as far as
[2650.16s] Baba nothing has changed and nothing&#39;s
[2651.839s] changed for the year plus that I&#39;ve been
[2653.559s] talking about it every single week the
[2655.319s] end of the day you can buy it at 2014
[2657.839s] prices even after this rally the only
[2660.4s] difference is sales are up now
[2663.4s] 1,300% and earnings in cash flow are up
[2666.359s] 650 50% so you tell me what else is
[2669.2s] there to talk about seasonal weakness on
[2671.4s] tap question mark here&#39;s the data from
[2673.64s] Jeff hirs over at the stock Traders
[2675.48s] Almanac on average the next 11 days down
[2678.52s] a half a percent so we&#39;ll get a little
[2680.8s] volatility here uh also in an election
[2683.88s] year that tends to be exacerbated here&#39;s
[2686.0s] from a gentleman named Scott Brown uh
[2689.44s] October has been the worst month of
[2691.24s] election years worse than September and
[2694.2s] then
[2695.88s] um uh here is Ned Davis the cycle
[2699.119s] composite for the election year 2024 you
[2701.68s] see here beginning of October gets weak
[2704.04s] all the way to the last week of October
[2706.24s] mid-mon Spike and then you get the
[2708.119s] election clear and the thing absolutely
[2710.119s] rips off the bottom into year end we
[2712.079s] expect a similar type of uh analog for
[2715.48s] this year uh this is from Ryan Dietrich
[2718.88s] uh talking about the October return
[2720.52s] after you&#39;ve had a big start average is
[2724.52s] 3% so um Max lust harvesting we covered
[2729.599s] uh but those are the reasons to be
[2730.839s] pessimistic shortterm here are the
[2732.119s] reasons to be optimistic into year end
[2734.559s] China pushes for faster local Bond sales
[2736.76s] to boost growth I.E more fiscal stimulus
[2739.28s] coming to a theater near you Global
[2741.28s] liquidity is picking up after troughing
[2743.92s] in 2 late 2022 2023 has isn&#39;t anywhere
[2748.079s] near euphoric levels and probably will
[2750.48s] hit Peak around 2026 to passes any
[2754.04s] prologue price returns during the
[2755.839s] presidential cycle since 1945 Q4 on
[2759.44s] balance up
[2762.04s] 2.3% uh so um so even if you have a
[2765.16s] weaker October you&#39;re going to see some
[2767.64s] recovery meaningful recovery in November
[2769.8s] and December uh other reason to be
[2772.2s] excited uh this is the most amount of
[2774.319s] cuts uh that we&#39;ve seen since March of
[2776.559s] 2020 and if you were a buyer when we did
[2778.68s] that article in market watch on March
[2781.04s] 23rd when everyone was hunkered under
[2782.8s] the table uh you can find it on on the
[2785.28s] website by the way you can just go go
[2787.0s] into the search bar type market watch
[2789.119s] and you it&#39;ll come up uh scroll back to
[2792.0s] 2020 March 23rd Market bottom the next

[2917.319s] things that happened this week we

[2920.48s] jolts uh we covered uh total vehicle
[2923.8s] sales were were
[2926.2s] 15.1 last print uh expected to be 15.6
[2931.04s] for this month in September actually
[2933.04s] came in at 15.8 151 to 158 this is
[2937.119s] unbelievable this is before the impact
[2940.88s] of cuts this is before the impact of end
[2944.2s] of year incentives we&#39;re super excited
[2947.88s] um all right uh let&#39;s go to the
[2950.64s] questions of the week ask me anything
[2953.319s] questions uh let&#39;s tune in here the
[2957.04s] first one comes
[2958.72s] from
[2960.799s] Ray
[2962.599s] catrib five Monon listener wish I&#39;d
[2965.0s] heard about your podcast a long time
[2966.48s] love the disciplined approach and
[2968.28s] framework many thanks for sharing your
[2969.72s] wisdom well many thanks for listening uh
[2972.4s] podcast human is on your radar what are
[2974.359s] your thoughts on Humanity now the stock
[2975.96s] is going down stock is 20
[2980.079s] uh okay so let&#39;s see what&#39;s happening
[2984.2s] with
[2987.079s] human we haven&#39;t done anything with this
[2989.96s] yet we&#39;re not in a rush to do anything
[2992.28s] we&#39;ve got a lot of companies that we
[2993.92s] love uh
[2996.799s] what is going on here all right well
[2998.96s] it&#39;s more on our radar now than it was
[3001.2s] the when when we uh talked about it a
[3003.92s] week or so ago uh yeah there was
[3007.68s] something about
[3010.839s] the ah what the heck was it it was
[3013.319s] something about the uh
[3016.319s] reimbursements that they&#39;re going to get
[3017.96s] hit for a few billion dollars or
[3019.559s] something like that I think was the
[3022.88s] news 2025 membership for its top rated
[3026.2s] Medicare
[3028.16s] plan Medicare star
[3032.96s] ratings okay so I&#39;ll look into that that
[3035.64s] probably creates an opportunity let me
[3037.64s] put that down next to oil services
[3039.64s] materials and human not doing anything
[3042.48s] on that yet no real change I mean we
[3044.559s] just look at the fundamentals on this
[3045.92s] call that&#39;s like 1% of the work then you
[3049.359s] got to really dig into the business and
[3051.2s] we haven&#39;t done that yet because we we
[3052.799s] simply don&#39;t have a place for it yet so
[3055.28s] uh we&#39;re happy with our current holding
[3056.96s] Tim felmingham we&#39;re you know we get
[3060.599s] I&#39;ve covered this a million times but
[3062.04s] let me emphasize for the new listeners
[3064.319s] because if you&#39;re on this it&#39;s you know
[3067.799s] we have a ton of people on this call a
[3070.119s] lot of family offices a lot of ultra
[3072.52s] high net worth ctim millionaires half
[3075.04s] billionaires and multi-billionaires on
[3077.28s] this call and most of them got very very
[3080.76s] successful as
[3083.04s] entrepreneurs um and the way you become
[3085.359s] successful as an entrepreneur is through
[3087.359s] Massive Action and in this business and
[3090.68s] that&#39;s why most incredible entrepreneurs
[3094.079s] uh don&#39;t do well as investors
[3096.64s] because the biggest attribute of an
[3099.4s] investor to do well is massive inaction
[3102.599s] sitting on your hands doing a skilled
[3105.64s] framework and you know it&#39;s funny the
[3109.079s] smart wealthy people are great investors
[3112.119s] the super wealthy people are great
[3115.24s] Pickers of great invest you know I was
[3117.28s] looking uh across you know um my
[3121.44s] accounts and all the incredible people
[3122.96s] who have invested with me and I&#39;m like
[3125.599s] wow you know this has been amazing
[3127.24s] what&#39;s taking place here with Baba and
[3129.2s] everything else just starting everything
[3130.72s] is clicking on all cylinders I say as
[3133.319s] great as I feel about picking these
[3135.16s] stocks these guys were much smarter than
[3137.96s] me they just picked the right manager
[3139.559s] they don&#39;t have to do this every day uh
[3142.68s] I love doing it every day but like as as
[3145.04s] smart as some of these picks of been
[3147.4s] they&#39;re a 100 times smarter for picking
[3149.48s] the right manager like they must be
[3151.28s] saying my goodness like look at look at
[3153.4s] what&#39;s happening and all I had to do was
[3155.48s] pick the right guy so uh very very
[3158.16s] grateful for that all right um Tom
[3162.0s] thanks always for the useful information
[3163.799s] you provide is very much appreciated
[3165.319s] here in the UK uh you covered Intel a
[3167.64s] lot over the last few weeks you see many
[3171.92s] positives what needs to happen for Intel
[3174.2s] become a buy now there is no buy now
[3176.599s] think you&#39;re going to get the perfect
[3177.72s] day or the perfect week you&#39;re out of
[3179.2s] your mind you don&#39;t get multi-baggers
[3181.04s] that way you get multi-baggers because
[3182.88s] you apply a framework you look at
[3185.04s] solvency risk you know we&#39;re looking at
[3187.0s] the the guarantee the implicit
[3189.04s] government guarantee and um you know
[3192.4s] they&#39;re going to ship the gouty 3 people
[3194.119s] are going to see how incredible it is
[3195.559s] the lunar lake is going the 18a they&#39;ll
[3198.4s] get the8 billion from the chips sa all
[3201.4s] these things will start to click but
[3203.119s] you&#39;re not going to pick the buy now
[3204.48s] you&#39;re going to buy some at 23 you&#39;re
[3206.64s] going to buy some at maybe at 17 you&#39;re
[3209.0s] going to buy some at 25 maybe uh and
[3212.559s] then you know two three four years out
[3214.2s] it&#39;s $40 50 $60 and if they actually
[3216.799s] start producing these uh competitive
[3219.16s] chips the gpus versus the CPUs of their
[3221.76s] legacy business which is worth 40 to 50
[3224.319s] bucks uh then you can have a hundred
[3226.24s] bucks but uh we don&#39;t know yet they&#39;ve
[3228.319s] got to deliver but in the meantime you
[3231.4s] know we look at our downsides pretty
[3233.92s] much protected if they liquidated the
[3235.48s] company today uh You&#39; probably get back
[3238.24s] you know full 20 25 bucks it&#39;s trading
[3240.799s] below tangible book uh oh and by the way
[3243.839s] their company doing 50 some OD billion
[3245.76s] dollars of Revenue that the US
[3247.68s] government is dependent on uh for
[3250.16s] geopolitical uh strategic uh safety uh
[3254.64s] so the last time you had a company that
[3256.72s] was fully backstopped by the government
[3258.16s] it was called Tesla because they were so
[3260.72s] intent on on pushing these EVs and Tesla
[3264.119s] was subsidized billions upon billions of
[3266.119s] dollar
[3267.24s] and created one of the greatest
[3268.599s] companies in the world I think Intel has
[3270.599s] the opportunity to take advantage of
[3272.799s] that single-minded because people can&#39;t
[3275.52s] just set up a Fab I mean Intel is so far
[3278.4s] ahead of what anyone else could do so as
[3280.4s] much as everyone wants to buy the arms
[3283.359s] and the nvidias and the um um Le amds
[3290.079s] and all that stuff they are the designer
[3292.96s] they are so dependent on the ability of
[3295.359s] tsmc
[3296.88s] Samsung or Intel to produce their stuff
[3299.44s] they can design all day long if they
[3300.88s] can&#39;t produce they&#39;re worthless so for
[3303.4s] me that puts uh and Intel is the only
[3306.359s] game in town so effectively what&#39;s
[3307.96s] setting up with Intel is a monopoly uh
[3311.4s] government-backed Monopoly which are the
[3313.44s] greatest kinds of Monopoly which is
[3315.0s] effectively what happened with Tesla uh
[3317.76s] during its run and um so uh so tell me
[3321.799s] how you really feel about Intel Tom all
[3324.0s] right moving along uh thought this is
[3327.119s] from Mark Mello interested in your
[3329.599s] thoughts on British American Tobacco uh
[3332.28s] look cheap stock with the dividend
[3338.16s] uh I you know it&#39;s had this move you
[3341.24s] know
[3342.64s] these it&#39;s F there are better ways to
[3345.2s] use your money like if it
[3348.28s] was it&#39;ll probably grind sideways and
[3350.839s] pay your dividend but there are uh
[3353.559s] higher and better uses of capital than
[3356.4s] that and we&#39;ve covered that in recent
[3357.76s] weeks the financials are fine but it&#39;s
[3359.839s] like you know it&#39;s a literal cigar butt
[3362.599s] you know uh Ben Graham and Warren
[3365.24s] Buffett talked about cigar butts that&#39;s
[3366.76s] a cigar butt it&#39;s a declining business
[3369.2s] but they buy back stock they generate a
[3371.4s] ton of free cash flow from all the
[3372.839s] people that are addicted and it&#39;ll
[3375.0s] continue for some time and they&#39;ll buy
[3376.76s] some more uh addictive businesses like
[3379.44s] vaping and all the other stuff that&#39;s
[3381.2s] bad for people and they&#39;ll continue to
[3382.799s] pay the dividend but you know it look if
[3386.039s] it was cheaper I would buy it but I I
[3387.72s] don&#39;t really love uh that stuff Lou R
[3391.839s] Rue Reynolds love the show recommended
[3393.96s] to all my friends thank you very much
[3395.72s] and for all of you that have been
[3397.559s] listening in and getting tremendous
[3399.079s] value uh the number one compliment you
[3401.359s] can pay me is to share it with one
[3404.76s] friend or more who loves the markets and
[3407.72s] help them out as well um does Cooper
[3410.559s] standard have big risk exposure to the
[3412.24s] Port strike which started October 1st or
[3414.359s] do revenues just keep getting booked and
[3415.88s] customers get their orders later uh
[3418.16s] there&#39;s risk there&#39;s obviously risk 28%
[3420.319s] of goods go through there however um
[3424.72s] their risk is not as big as 90% of the
[3426.839s] other companies that have the risk and
[3429.68s] uh you have to make bets on
[3432.88s] um kind of game theory and and I would
[3435.68s] assume that if this goes for more than a
[3438.2s] week and a half or two Biden is going to
[3440.96s] have to step in or they&#39;re going to lose
[3442.72s] the election and um now Biden may say
[3446.68s] listen these guys push me out against my
[3448.319s] will uh payback&#39;s a I mean there&#39;s
[3450.599s] something to be said for that but I
[3451.96s] doubt the powers that be will allow that
[3454.0s] to happen and therefore I would bet on
[3456.799s] the obvious which is it either gets
[3458.48s] resolved or more likely he can save face
[3461.76s] and say look uh this is holiday season
[3465.039s] we have to get the goods in for
[3466.2s] Christmas therefore I&#39;m going to
[3468.24s] Institute Taft heartley just until
[3470.68s] November to get maybe November 6th or
[3473.96s] thereabouts just to get enough Goods in
[3475.599s] for Christmas so all the little boys and
[3477.2s] girls can be happy with their gifts and
[3479.119s] then they can go back to fighting
[3480.76s] November 6 right after the election um
[3484.039s] all right hi Tom Ronan bitten from
[3486.64s] Israel big fan hey Ronan look uh sorry
[3489.64s] to hear about everything that&#39;s going on
[3491.2s] over there I hope you&#39;re staying safe um
[3494.64s] would like your opinion on
[3496.799s] a thank you
[3499.44s] a is Alexandria real estate Equity ah
[3506.24s] I don&#39;t ah yeah I&#39;m not really in love
[3511.039s] yes I like okay so we did the Vornado
[3514.72s] quick double last year vado&#39;s now back
[3517.16s] it&#39;s
[3518.079s] going I&#39;m not in love with multif family
[3521.359s] because there&#39;s so much new Supply on
[3523.52s] the market and coming on the market and
[3527.079s] starts
[3529.319s] um let me just look at their balance
[3531.559s] sheet I think this one&#39;s going to be
[3533.119s] okay
[3534.52s] but um
[3537.319s] balance sheet financial analysis balance
[3545.039s] sheet
[3547.799s] 61 debt is 12 billion cash is half a
[3551.599s] billion but secured by property what&#39;s
[3553.839s] the asset
[3560.559s] value 33 billion uh 33 billion
[3567.64s] or 38 is
[3572.16s] gross let&#39;s
[3580.799s] see all
[3583.0s] right let&#39;s look at
[3588.0s] this yeah this one&#39;s probably all right
[3591.039s] um I have to do a lot more work but it
[3592.88s] certainly warrants
[3597.44s] doing more work
[3600.0s] um my general view is there&#39;s going to
[3602.72s] be a counter Trend move in these rats
[3604.28s] and utilities so maybe rates back up a
[3606.72s] little bit for the short term and
[3608.24s] that&#39;ll be your opportunity to buy very
[3609.96s] small yield for what it is though 4.4
[3612.319s] and you&#39;re not really going to
[3614.119s] get yeah I I think it&#39;s okay see if we
[3617.559s] get a little yield backup uh see if you
[3620.92s] when you get a correction in utilities
[3622.64s] this would be a time to buy this um but
[3625.44s] it looks not bad I just um not for me uh
[3630.359s] Kyle M first
[3633.24s] off you mentioned during your vfc Deep
[3636.799s] dive podcast you rarely hear from folks
[3638.799s] oh you rarely hear from folks about
[3640.319s] calls that go right and usually only
[3641.96s] hear the ones that haven&#39;t uh started
[3644.4s] moving yet uh thanks for the education
[3647.119s] on Baba and congrats on the
[3648.88s] call
[3650.839s] uh okay so he&#39;s asking about Advanced
[3653.68s] Auto Parts Advanced Auto Parts fine they
[3656.2s] risk the problem is is what&#39;s the eida
[3658.68s] moving forward and they&#39;re doing we went
[3661.16s] we did a deep dive on that like a month
[3662.76s] ago nothing&#39;s really changed he&#39;s asking
[3664.64s] if I&#39;ve added we have added at the
[3666.2s] margins but not like Baba added uh When
[3669.2s] Baba was down this has never been a core
[3671.64s] position this has been a good size
[3673.48s] position but not huge uh but we&#39;re
[3676.48s] comfortable with it here maybe we maybe
[3678.52s] we&#39;ll add a few more shares there&#39;s just
[3680.44s] no Catalyst until the next earnings call
[3682.559s] because they already told you that uh
[3684.88s] they&#39;re going to be weak this quarter so
[3687.079s] it&#39;s just going to languish until it
[3688.599s] finally takes off and people realize the
[3691.599s] significance of the sale and the
[3693.72s] deleverage and the impact of cash flow
[3696.24s] and the turnaround so it&#39;ll just hang
[3698.359s] there but uh no change other than he&#39;s
[3701.039s] executing exactly what he promised he
[3702.72s] would and we&#39;re we&#39;re comfortable with
[3704.68s] that um that&#39;s Shane o Kelly who ran HD
[3709.2s] Supply for Home Depot 7 billion doll
[3711.24s] business that was a beast and still is
[3713.68s] uh I wanted to ask you about WBA this is
[3715.559s] from Jan Jan I cover this every week
[3718.0s] it&#39;s not for me until they take the
[3719.88s] locks off the doors and they do some
[3721.68s] type of criminal reform where if you
[3723.16s] steal something from a store you
[3724.599s] actually go to jail I&#39;m not really
[3726.44s] interested this is a complete they&#39;re
[3728.68s] going to figure it out there&#39;s an
[3730.0s] enormous amount of value and there&#39;s
[3731.52s] only two players left but
[3735.599s] um they&#39;re just they&#39;re just hiring
[3737.92s] better uses
[3740.599s] um so all that would be is just a trade
[3743.44s] you&#39;re looking for a double bounce off
[3744.92s] the bottom and
[3746.64s] uh it&#39;s not what I do Yuki Nish
[3753.72s] Nisha I mean here&#39;s how I think about it
[3756.119s] by the way it&#39;s very
[3758.48s] simple this is the way you should go
[3760.48s] into every
[3763.359s] company if JP Morgan was going to
[3765.68s] finance me to to take private the entire
[3771.16s] Walgreens boot boots allons they would
[3773.52s] give me a credit line uh for whatever
[3776.319s] it&#39;s worth now tens of billions of
[3779.039s] dollars uh and I had to be the equity
[3782.96s] and put up 90% of my net worth to take
[3786.079s] the company private with JP Morgan&#39;s
[3788.76s] financing would I put 90% of my net
[3791.2s] worth up to buy Walgreens boots Alliance
[3794.76s] at these discounted levels and the
[3797.039s] answer is no therefore I&#39;m not going to
[3799.799s] play it for a double trade off the
[3801.839s] bottom um thanks for the great lessons
[3804.799s] you teach
[3807.2s] um all right so he&#39;s asking what this is
[3810.16s] from Yuki and Japan what has to happen
[3812.599s] for Advanced Auto Parts to get the same
[3815.119s] multiple as AutoZone and all that stuff
[3817.119s] it&#39;s going to take time but um I don&#39;t
[3819.359s] know if they&#39;ll ever get that multiple
[3820.96s] but they don&#39;t need to for it to be you
[3823.039s] know a double triple plus um it&#39;s just
[3826.64s] going to take a few years Jimbo
[3828.96s] Jones uh could you review valet okay I
[3832.76s] keep looking at valet and I keep passing
[3834.68s] and I keep wondering why I keep passing
[3837.559s] let me just see because this is a
[3839.24s] materials play I think you&#39;ll be okay
[3842.279s] here I just think that there are better
[3845.119s] plays in this base and
[3853.48s] um yeah I
[3855.92s] mean I think these cash I think the cash
[3858.359s] flow on revenues are going to pick back
[3859.52s] up but that&#39;s why the stock is down so
[3861.2s] it&#39;s not a big surprise I just think
[3862.96s] it&#39;s milk toast it it&#39;s not like I can&#39;t
[3865.319s] see myself getting a multibagger here so
[3867.359s] why even why even tie up the capital uh
[3870.88s] ocidental petroleum because they&#39;re
[3873.2s] doing carbon capture this is from Eric I
[3875.68s] I don&#39;t oxy is not going to move because
[3877.559s] they&#39;re doing car carbon capture I have
[3879.44s] no interest I don&#39;t think the integrated
[3881.559s] have come down enough for me to be
[3882.76s] interested and everyone keeps getting
[3884.0s] faked out because uh Buffett keeps
[3886.559s] buying it the problem is what they don&#39;t
[3888.4s] realize is Buffett is exercising
[3889.96s] warrants that he got here in 2019 look
[3893.92s] it up he did a debt financing and got a
[3896.839s] ton of free warrants at $59 so he&#39;s
[3899.68s] exercising those warrants he&#39;s not
[3901.799s] buying new stock uh as everyone thinks
[3904.76s] he is so for me you know the time to buy
[3907.0s] it was in 2020 when we were buying Exxon
[3910.079s] Mobile hand over fist in the hole now
[3912.52s] that it&#39;s up eight bagger everyone can
[3915.119s] you know oh no it&#39;s it&#39;s not for me
[3918.0s] because it&#39;s not going to double from
[3919.44s] here over I mean it might double from
[3921.48s] here but it&#39;s like Comstock could be a
[3924.279s] multibagger uh in my view and that&#39;s
[3926.599s] where I want to take risk in the space
[3928.4s] and I think some of the servicers are
[3930.88s] getting uh to the point where they could
[3933.4s] be um at least doubles or triples what
[3936.64s] amazing week in China this is from um
[3940.52s] Sagar uh kanakia thanks seagar I know
[3944.4s] you&#39;ve been listening for a long time uh
[3946.52s] so he&#39;s asking about Stanis the answer
[3949.319s] is no they keep asking me about the car
[3951.68s] makers I don&#39;t want to be in the car
[3953.2s] maker business because effectively all
[3955.64s] all they are is annuity companies and
[3958.119s] health insurance companies that happen
[3959.88s] to make automobiles they&#39;re controlled
[3962.039s] by the unions their margins are going to
[3963.92s] go down they&#39;re going to be forced to
[3965.2s] produce more cars it&#39;s going to be a
[3966.599s] race to the bottom and we are going to
[3968.4s] benefit from that race to the bottom
[3970.48s] because we are the Arms Dealer with
[3973.0s] Cooper standard so not interested in
[3975.599s] that am interested in higher volumes as
[3978.4s] they race to the bottom and we will take
[3980.64s] advantage could you please take a look
[3982.039s] at coals no interest in Coals that thing
[3984.52s] has been dead money for a while and I
[3987.319s] think will continue to be amazing past
[3990.24s] week for
[3991.48s] China okay we covered that it&#39;s amazing
[3994.96s] how exciting everyone is now by the way
[3997.24s] good stuff on Baba thanks Kayla human
[4000.119s] has taken a precipitous drop yeah I&#39;m
[4002.279s] looking at it uh not doing anything with
[4004.559s] it yet uh Boeing management potentially
[4007.4s] diluting shares a concern no that&#39;s a
[4009.599s] positive because they keep their
[4010.88s] investment rating they get more staying
[4013.039s] power against the unions they&#39;ll
[4014.44s] negotiate a better deal turn the spets
[4016.799s] back Lo back on deal with their backlog
[4020.44s] start to generate cash flow and buy back
[4023.24s] the stock
[4024.96s] Damian
[4026.559s] Langer oh sorry okay so with that
[4032.48s] said just make sure I&#39;m not missing
[4035.319s] anything
[4037.24s] uh yeah that was from Nolan about the
[4039.559s] AutoZone P just going to take time uh n
[4044.079s] deep uh be Beyond me Beyond not
[4047.68s] interested I don&#39;t care if it&#39;s down n
[4049.839s] he says it&#39;s down 96% it could be down
[4051.92s] 99% you couldn&#39;t pay me to eat that
[4054.16s] leather with your mouth so hard pass uh
[4058.2s] David
[4059.119s] Martin uh
[4063.119s] inmd they do
[4069.2s] uh okay let&#39;s take a look at
[4073.24s] inmd I think it&#39;s medical device
[4079.24s] is all right this is a broken stock
[4082.24s] let&#39;s see if they&#39;re generating any
[4099.52s] cash they are generating a lot of
[4102.319s] cash uh margins are holding in
[4111.279s] uh financial analysis let&#39;s see
[4118.719s] here all right so the only thing we have
[4121.759s] to do with a company like this is figure
[4126.759s] out uh what&#39;s the bare thesis because
[4129.279s] this looks good so it&#39;s going right
[4130.839s] underneath my oil services research my
[4133.64s] materials research my human and my
[4138.04s] inmd so I want to understand this there
[4140.4s] might be a comp competitive threat but
[4142.839s] this is definitely worth uh exploring so
[4146.199s] good job on that David Martin all right
[4150.799s] um Paul found
[4156.839s] cone I
[4159.08s] think oh by the way Paul says uh two
[4161.56s] more weeks and you&#39;ll hit the fiveyear
[4163.199s] mark for your podcast pretty incredible
[4165.56s] pretty awesome been great to watch you
[4167.04s] and protect your craft over the last few
[4168.759s] years thanks Paul uh pzza I don&#39;t know
[4171.679s] if we covered this or
[4174.719s] not I&#39;ve never liked it since the the
[4177.159s] founder uh got kicked out but um I can
[4181.12s] see let me just see if they&#39;re doing
[4183.6s] okay with revenues and cash flow I think
[4185.359s] this is going to work because this is
[4186.359s] going to fall in the discretionary
[4187.56s] bucket and I&#39;ve wanted to find some
[4190.12s] restaurants now that everyone hates them
[4193.4s] uh looks like cash flow is kind of
[4196.12s] okay gross margins okay yeah this one
[4199.159s] definitely deserves a look so uh good
[4201.52s] find
[4203.44s] Paul
[4205.8s] and just make sure here txt this is from
[4210.96s] JT um I think that&#39;s
[4215.44s] Textron
[4222.48s] yeah okay
[4229.199s] uh now for me I don&#39;t buy things that
[4231.199s] are up 5x uh in a in three years that
[4234.52s] someone else already took the juice out
[4236.0s] of that trade so I&#39;m going to pass
[4237.8s] fundamentals are okay cash flows
[4239.32s] declining stock pric is going up
[4241.0s] revenues are flat um pass so with that
[4244.84s] said I want to thank everyone for tuning
