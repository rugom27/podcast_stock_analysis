## Macro Thesis & Key Data Points
The market is undergoing a regime change with small caps and emerging markets outperforming. Fiscal stimulus in China and potential rate cuts will drive growth. Short-term volatility is expected due to pre-election jitters and geopolitical events, but a year-end rally is anticipated.

| Indicator | Value | Tom's Interpretation |
|-----------|-------|----------------------|
| US 30-year mortgage rate | Declined for eight consecutive weeks, from 7.2 to 6.12 | This will continue, potentially reaching a high 5 handle by year-end or Q1, igniting the housing market. |
| China Equity Rallies | Historically fueled by stimulus | Expectations of 50-100% gains are reasonable. |
| Global Monetary Easing | Largest month of easing since April 2020 | This is a buying opportunity, similar to Q1 2020 and 2009. |
| Economic Surprise Index | Turning up | This is indicative of expansions, not contractions. |
| China MSCI earnings per share | Trading at 6.5 times forward p/e | Unbelievable valuation, profit margins are going up. |
| Total vehicle sales | Increased from 15.1 to 15.8 | This is unbelievable, before the impact of cuts and end of year incentives. |
