  "cleaned_transcript": "Want to thank Christian Dagger and the great Stuart Vney for having me on Fox Business this morning to talk the Fed, talk a couple picks, talk a couple names, talk a little bit of outlook. We&#39;re going to listen in here. Remember, the markets are closed for the Junth holiday. Dow&#39;s off 300, NASDAQ&#39;s down 200 points. Tom Hayes joins me now to check out the market even though it&#39;s closed today. All right, Tom. Uh Trump says that J. pow at the Fed should lower rates right now. Is he right? He&#39;s not only right, he&#39;s been right every single step of the way, Stu, about too late Powell. So, the good news is we&#39;re going to get two cuts this year. 64% chance starting in September. They&#39;ll probably set the table at Jackson Hole. The bad news is in the meantime we&#39;re paying 200 basis points above inflation in terms of our debt service which equates to about $600 billion a year. Who pays that Stu? We pay that as taxpayers. It&#39;s completely unnecessary. You know who else is getting hurt from this wrong-minded policy? The millennials. 72 million millennials are trying to start a house, a family, family formation. They can&#39;t do it at 7.25% 25% 30-year fixed rate mortgage. Home builders can&#39;t take the risk with their capital at 7% uh and speculate that people are going to buy it. They&#39;ll just sit there in inventory. We need to come down 200 basis points. And President Trump has made the case if he&#39;s right about his prediction that inflation is going up, he can always hype 25 basis points. It&#39;s much easier to quell inflation than to deal with deflation or unemployment by being too late. Maybe this is a technical question, but the president wants one full percentage point drop in interest rates. If he did that, would the yield on the 10-year Treasury come down one full percentage point, 100 basis points, and would that lead to a drop in the mortgage rate of one full percentage point? Well, they can issue shortterm notes. So, that can bring down financing costs. As far as the long end of the curve, uh, uh, Secretary Bessant is working on that with bank capital requirements this summer. They&#39;ll they&#39;ll create a lot of demand for banks to hold treasuries once again. Uh, they can issue on the short short end and do an operation twist type of situation where they buy in the long end of the curve, bring down 10-year yields, bring down 30-year fixed rate mortgages. And by the way, I I I don&#39;t know if Powell will be will be successful, but I do think Bessant will be successful in bringing down the 10-year yield, which is going to bring mortgage rates below 6% before the end of the year, and that&#39;s going to be a good thing, as well as the stable coin demand for treasuries, the bill that was just passed yesterday, the Genius Act. Okay, you brought two stock picks with you. We got to get through them fast. Uh, first off, GXO Logistics. GXO. Yes. This is a Brad Jacobs company. The last Brad Jacobs company I came to your audience with two months ago was QXO. It&#39;s up 65% in the last two months. This one we believe is just taking off. It&#39;s a worldwide logistics company. Two catalysts. Number one, the CEO announced he was retiring several months back. So, we&#39;re going to get an announcement of a new CEO. That&#39;s going to be a positive catalyst. And number two, on June 25th, the CMA, the UK regulatory body, is going to rule on their Winkitin acquisition whether or not they need to divest the grocery business. The grocery business is only 6% of the revenues of Winkitin. So once that is completed, they can integrate, get the cost synergies, generate over 800 million of IBIDA this year. We think the stock&#39;s going from 42 to over 60 before the end of the year. Uh that&#39;s a good one. Okay. And the second one I got for you, you&#39;ve only got you got 20 seconds cuz we&#39;re almost out of time. Albamar, lithium miner. Albamar, go. Lowest cost, one of the largest lithium producers, very cyclical business. Prices are in a trough state. This happens every 5 to 8 years.

He&#39;s founder, chairman, and managing member of Great Hill Capital. Welcome back to the show, Thomas. Uh first off, I&#39;d like to get your reaction to the decision. Uh it was expected, but is the Fed getting it right? I don&#39;t think they are. I think Powell has unintentionally put him him himself in the position of being a lame duck for the remainder of his term. I think you&#39;re going to see President Trump start to allude to the next Fed chair which will create a shadow Fed situation which is going to be a dovish Fed moving forward. And I think President Trump made a couple important points today. Number one is Powell is about 200 basis points too restrictive. meaning the Fed funds rate is about 200 basis points more than inflation and that&#39;s going going to catch up and the the concept of too late Powell uh whether you love it or don&#39;t love it, President Trump has been right every single time and I think this this situation is going to be the case this time. That&#39;s the bad news. The good news is Powell was slightly more dovish. It originally looked as if the meeting was hawkish, but he did adjust language from the firming language to the adjustments language. And I would say one last thing, Diego, is that uh the Fed is supposed to be data dependent. And the whole meeting was about him predicting that inflation was going to go up because of tariffs, even though that simply was not the case in 2018. And I think pal uh President Trump has made the point in past appearances where he said, &quot;Listen, why don&#39;t you just cut and if you&#39;re right about inflation, you can always raise rates. He could always do a 25 or 50 point raise if inflation ticks up from tariffs.&quot; But if he&#39;s wrong, he&#39;s certainly going to be too late. And that is a risk to the economy. And uh and somewhat reflected in the projections, they&#39;re still projecting two cuts towards the end of the year. If they&#39;re so sure about that, why don&#39;t they just go ahead with it? Yeah, there was a lot of caution about the effect of tariffs uh during Powell&#39;s speech today and his uh and while he fielded uh journalist\n\n was expected, but is the Fed getting it right? I don&#39;t think they are. I think Powell has unintentionally put him him himself in the position of being a lame duck for the remainder of his term. I think you&#39;re going to see President Trump start to allude to the next Fed chair which will create a shadow Fed situation which is going to be a dovish Fed moving forward.

Number one is Powell is about 200 basis points too restrictive. meaning the Fed funds rate is about 200 basis points more than inflation and that&#39;s going going to catch up and the the concept of too late Powell uh whether you love it or don&#39;t love it, President Trump has been right every single time and I think this this situation is going to be the case this time. That&#39;s the bad news. The good news is Powell was slightly more dovish. It originally looked as if the meeting was hawkish, but he did adjust language from the firming language to the adjustments language. And I would say one last thing, Diego, is that uh the Fed is supposed to be data dependent. And the whole meeting was about him predicting that inflation was going to go up because of tariffs, even though that simply was not the case in 2018. And I think pal uh President Trump has made the point in past appearances where he said, &quot;Listen, why don&#39;t you just cut and if you&#39;re right about inflation, you can always raise rates. He could always do a 25 or 50 point raise if inflation ticks up from tariffs.&quot; But if he&#39;s wrong, he&#39;s certainly going to be too late. And that is a risk to the economy. And uh and somewhat reflected in the projections, they&#39;re still projecting two cuts towards the end of the year. If they&#39;re so sure about that, why don&#39;t they just go ahead with it? Yeah, there was a lot of caution about the effect of tariffs uh during Powell&#39;s speech today and his uh and while he fielded uh journalist\n### MISCELLANEOUS\nquestions , but GDP numbers have not been showing signs of tariffs impact so far. Uh we also got some better data uh about dropping, you know, sharply earlier this week. How how how trade uncertainty is shaping consumer spending right now? Yeah, look, we saw consumer confidence was okay. The GDP now numbers look strong. We will not have two consecutive quarters of negative GDP growth. So all of that is constructive. But at the same time, you have 72 millennials, million millennials, the largest segment of our population now, who have had to delay their lives because of Jerome Powell. They cannot afford houses because mortgage rates are too high. uh and uh and that&#39;s that&#39;s going to have knock-on effects for many generations to come if they don&#39;t move quickly. Uh again, the the the Fed is appointed to be data dependent. He is predicting and he continued to predict that inflation is going to go up and he may be right, but if he&#39;s right, he can adjust. It&#39;s much easier to bring down inflation through rate cuts than to ward off deflation if you get it wrong and you&#39;re too late because the cost of bringing the economy out of recession and the cost the societal cost of unemployment uh is far too great particularly when you have debt to GDP of 120%. and we&#39;re paying $600 billion more per year in interest than we need to be doing given the rate of inflation and given the rate of uh employment at the moment. Yes, Thomas. During his speech or during his speaking this afternoon, Powell spoke about when he addressed the the real estate market about first the rates and second about housing supply and new home construction here in the US fell in May to a 5-year low with economists saying the housing sector is struggling to add overall economic growth this year. How do I look at that? Because that&#39;s a longer term thing. This no this is the unintended consequence of wrongminded decisions by the Fed. Who&#39;s going to build a house when rates are 7 725 and risk capital and hope that it sells? I&#39;m telling you, if rates come down below 30-year fix comes below 6%, in other words, if the Fed funds rate was at a reasonable level, uh the demand for housing would be unlimited. And you couple that with the uh current administration looking to deregulate. They&#39;re going to open 500 something thousand acres of federal land. By the way, most of which in metropolitan areas where there&#39;s demand for starter home construction. The only thing that&#39;s missing right now, the only one that&#39;s delaying everything is our predictor and chief Jay Powell, who is predicting what he thinks might happen to inflation. If he&#39;s so certain about his predictions, why doesn&#39;t he look at his real GDP expectations, which he cut down to 1.4% real GDP for 2025 if he believes in his predictions so much that he thinks real GDP is going to be 1.4%. He should have done 50 basis points today. So, right now, it looks like he&#39;s getting away with it. Everything&#39;s good. GDP is okay. Earnings are okay. Employment looks okay. mixed data on that front, but once it starts to turn the other way, it turns hard. And he has the runway right now to take action. He didn&#39;t take advantage of today. My sense is maybe he&#39;ll get two more months to get get through it. He&#39;ll announce something at Jackson Hole or set the table for the next cut in September. And he&#39;ll probably squeak through and thread the needle. Okay. A few months too late, but he&#39;ll squeak through uh and it will be okay. But uh there would there would have been no downside of doing it today other than saving taxpayers three months of excessive interest on our treasury. We&#39;ll certainly speak again then. In the meantime, thank you Thomas Hayes. Great having you. Thank you Diego. Much more and we&#39;re back and then on to the uh\n\nWho&#39;s going to build a house when rates are 7.725 and risk capital and hope that it sells? I&#39;m telling you, if rates come down below 30-year fix comes below 6%, in other words, if the Fed funds rate was at a reasonable level, uh the demand for housing would be unlimited. And you couple that with the uh current administration looking to deregulate. They&#39;re going to open 500 something thousand acres of federal land.

And he&#39;ll probably squeak through and thread the needle. Okay. A few months too late, but he&#39;ll squeak through uh and it will be okay. But uh there would there would have been no downside of doing it today other than saving taxpayers three months of excessive interest on our treasury. ### QUOTES_OF_THE_WEEK The intelligent investor is a realist who sells to optimists and buys from pessimists. Those of you who have been with me for a while know that this is what we do every single week. Warren Buffett, most people get interested in stocks when everyone else is. The time to get interested is when no one else is. You can&#39;t buy what is popular and do well. This is critically important, ladies and gentlemen. and uh and very different from, you know, I can always tell from the\n\n### QUOTES_OF_THE_WEEK\nquotes of the week  from Benjamin Graham. The intelligent investor is a realist who sells to optimists and buys from pessimists. Those of you who have been with me for a while know that this is what we do every single week. Warren Buffett, most people get interested in stocks when everyone else is. The time to get interested is when no one else is. You can&#39;t buy what is popular and do well.\n### ASK_ME_ANYTHING_QA\n\n### ASK_ME_ANYTHING_QA\nquestions  each week who is new to the podcast because they're asking\n\nquestions  each week who is new to the podcast because they're asking\n\n--- OVERLAP CONTINUED ---\n\nquestions  about the stocks that are in the\n\nquestions about the stocks that are in the\n\nheadlines  that week and the ones that have been around for one, two, three years. Uh number one, they're cool as a cucumber because by now they're they're wealthy relative to where they were. Uh and number two, they ask all the right questions\n\n### ASK_ME_ANYTHING_QA\n\n### MACRO_DATA_SLIDES\nlong only funds cyclical versus defensive positioning is very low versus history. So when we think about cyclicals think consumer discretionary like the the VF corpse etc. Energy tech industrials like the Generax like the Stanley Black & Deckers materials like the Albamaro tech like the Intels. We're going to talk about some developments there. Hedge funds are underweight cyclicals relative to defensives. always want to take the other side of the trade where the boat is crowded. Relative positioning at historic lows, which means we're going to see rip your face off moves uh in these baskets, which we have great exposure to. US dollar early stage secular bare market deterioration of the US government balance sheet, Fed policy, credibility and independence, new catalyst for China, Europe and Japan equities. Uh we can this has been a theme for us. We came into the year talking weak dollar. Everyone thought we were crazy. It continues to persist. Uh this is probably the most important data point of the week. And some of you are going to have a tough time understanding this one. Um uh and that's okay. Don't worry about it. I'll do my best to explain it. But what this chart is, it shows select growth and quality factors, percentage of respondents. This is the uh institutional manager survey. Percentage of respondents using return on equity edged higher in 2024. So what you can see is the quote unquote value investor of yestery year um has been forced into this new framework which basically means they've become closet indexers and they have justified it by calling it quality uh or growth at a reasonable price and uh it's masqueraded in the concept of return on equity or more commonly return on invested capital. Now return on equity and return on invested capital are critically important variables. Um however they tend to be um emphasized more so as it relates to what they call quality or durable secular growers which in effect has been mag seven. It's just a code. It's a fancy way of saying I'm not a closet indexer, but when you'll look at my book, I've been I've been basically bagged in the most crowded trades uh for a while. And if you look at the greatest value investors of all time, uh, that made billions in the 70s when the stock market did nothing from 1968 to 1972, whether it was Buffett or Cooperman or Gabelli, uh, kind of the value mafia I grew up with. Um, uh, no one is talking in those terms. No one is talking about the investing style of turnaround Tom that Buffett did when he was running his partnerships and shot the lights out before rolling his LPs into a permanent capital vehicle called Berkshire Hathaway. And uh what I'm the point that I'm making with this chart is that um and I was I was texting with a friend. I said so so these annotations are my own. The red being everyone now focused on quote unquote quality, return on equity. Uh whereas these periods in green are cyclicals value and turnaround turnaround Tom type of stuff. And um you can see the dramatic outperformance from 2001 to 2007. We've talked about that a lot. And then in the early 90s also in the 80s and then in a big way in the 70s. As a matter of fact, you know, we've we've talked about it. uh value has outperformed growth uh including this aberrational zerp period by 4% and change per year since 1927 including the last 10 years when we had zero interest rate policy which means if you had invested a million dollars in 1927 in value or growth uh you would have 68 million more dollars if you chose value. So what I told my friend is another way to look at it is follows. Quote, \"If I were looking in the rear view mirror, what would be the most important metric to be overweight?\" And what everyone was going to say is quality, uh, high return on equity, secular grower, aka code for mag 7, what worked yesterday. Uh, the church of what worked yesterday. Now much of the value quote unquote community is now singing from the same himnil because they've been forced to in order to survive. Most do don't do turnarounds well. They don't understand the the the framework and the formula that works. Um so they they and the and the value traps that they had been in uh certainly didn't work. So they've kind of moved into being growth investors without admitting it and just closet indexing. We are taking the exact opposite tact and believe those who have overweight exposure to the green cyclicals value turnarounds that are just starting to uh rock and roll following the once in aundredyear uh situation created by co uh will dramatically outperform the next 3 to 5 years. Even those who take the view that capital light has changed the game. So everyone that's now chasing what worked yesterday and focused on quality secular growers, high return on invested capital, high return on equity, which over time is a good formula to have except when everyone else is doing it. Um would be advised to at least hedge that view with solid green exposure in case the historical cycle proves to be recurrent. And I say in case to be gentle when the historic recurrent cycle proves to come back. Uh and it's already started to happen this year as you saw and and which has been a core to our theme. International would outperform US, dollar would get weaker. Now you're going to start to see smalls outperform large. Uh record short interest in small caps. Cyclical turnarounds. We're already seeing these home runs. Whether it's uh QXO, which is a cyclical, whether it's uh uh Comtock Resource is a cyclical, that's almost up uh eight times four, that's almost up four bags now. Um and on and on. So, the the game is just beginning here. So, you know, you might feel like you missed it when you look at indices because all you're looking at is this, which is due to take a continued breather. And we've talked about Max 7 trading back to the top of the range, but not more because their earnings growth is cut in half and their capex is going through the roof. Uh the fortunes are are going to continue to be made here uh for existing clients yearto date, you know what I'm talking about and so on. So, leaving that aside, even if you're of the view uh chasing what everyone else is doing and calling it something else, you'd be very wise if you're a large capital allocator to hedge that bet and have someone who's exceptionally skilled, which is a dying breed, by the way, in these areas right here. I would say in five years, you're going to see a huge crowd get very interested in this area, but by then all the money will be made by people like me. So, um, and you, so that's the name of the game. Uh, huge reversal in fund manager survey recession expectations in the last two months. Went from the tariffs to not the tariffs. So, this weekend, maybe Trump drops a a bunker bomb, maybe he doesn't. Market's a little jittery, but we'll get through that and we'll have an outcome by Monday for sure. Uh, FMS investors view corporate balance sheets as the best health since March of 2016. They've delevered. That's a good thing. Just like household balance sheets had. Oh, and by the way, uh here's my beautiful hedge fund tips with Tom Hayes mug. Price is what you pay. Value is what you get. Uh thanks for everyone sending in pictures. We got a new photo. Thanks just for sending it in, but the guy sent a picture of his cat. So, I don't know if that counts, but we did post them up with some of the other photos we've already gotten in. When you place an order, uh and I think the golf shirts are back in. Uh the t-shirts have been a big hit. obviously the hats and mugs, but um send your picture to we we have so many orders and so few pictures. So, stop being shy. If you want, just put a fake name or whatever and we'll we'll post you. But, uh we covered these last week. Uh a lot of hats and t-shirts. So this is our latest from Don G who is a cat reading the intelligent investor by Ben Graham and uh sitting next to his hedge fund tips hat. Best performing asset in the next 5 years fund manager survey says international stocks opinion follows trend. What a difference a half a year makes. Couldn't give away international when we were pounding the table. Now everyone wants it. It's just getting started ladies and gentlemen. uh asset quilt of total returns. Uh MSCI EA is up 18% year-to date. Emerging markets up 13.9%. Uh S&P up only 3%. REITs up 5%. Uh global high yield cash and commodities. So that's that. We've seen very few instances where gold is at the top of the range for more than two years. The last time that happened was uh 2010 to 2011. The next year it fell to third to the bottom. The following year after that it had the absolute worst performance. So for everyone chasing gold up here, God help you. Investors on EPS and leverage net percent of FMS investors think that global corporate profit growth will improve. That's coming off the lows, but it's at levels like you saw in COVID, like you saw in the tech wreck in 2022, and like you saw in the great financial crisis and the tech wreck of 20201. The sentiment is still subdued. Midcap ETFs accelerating in inflows. This is the theme. small and midcap starting to play just like you saw in 2001 to 2003 and then straight through outperformance to 2007. Lower financial leverage than 20 thou uh 1990s and 2000s. You can look at the balance sheet here. We haven't had this low leverage since the mid80s for corporate balance sheets. Global materials still dramatically underweight. That's where Albamaro in a quasi related sense, Comtock Resources, that's why you're starting to see huge moves there. Uh, household holdings as equity of equities as a percentage of total financial assets. This is US equities, ladies and gentlemen. And honestly, we haven't had this highest percentage since ' 68. Um, market kind of topped out in ' 68 and certainly started to collapse from 72 to 74. uh 2000 and 2024. Now you have to consider that top 10 stocks is still 40% of the S&P 500. So what this means is the overweight relative to everything else. Same thing in 2000 if you remember the magazine covers uh in 1999 saying has Warren Buffett lost his touch and Warren Buffett was buying Proctor and Gamble. he was buying all these defensive stocks, uh, staple stocks, boring stocks, industrial stocks at the top of the quote unquote market in 2000. And in 2001 and 2002, while the NASDAQ crashed 90, his stocks rocketed. So, you're thinking like, well, if the market crashes, um, would, you know, wouldn't everything crash? And the answer is no when you have such a concentrated period, if you are in the right things. And that's why you need to hedge out with especially if you're a large allocator with someone who is a specialist in the greens unless you think this is going to be the exception where this doesn't revert to the mean and those top 10 weights meaning 40% don't underperform for the next handful of years and our case is that they will and they have and you've seen it year to date even though they're bouncing back in the range. We had said that they will bounce back to the top of the range and in aggregate not overtake if you take a mags versus you know one stock someone will say well what about Microsoft or what about one of these that's making new highs yeah there will be one or two but you you know you look at uh Tesla is still down Google's still down even Amazon which is probably a buy um so so you want to f to make massive amounts of money in the next two to three years you need to find what's not in these percentages that are going going to be a uh at the effect of mean reversion. Bank of America global fund manager survey investor sentiment improves slightly from May uh via bearish April level. Again, you see these levels only at the 2022 lows, the COVID lows, uh the first trade war, the EU debt crisis, great financial crisis and 9/11. So, uh, for those who think that everyone's too bullish and therefore we're going to crash, uh, they're absolutely incorrect. I I think after we get through this Iran volatility, uh, we're going to push to new highs before the end of summer, probably before the end of July. Bubbles, uh, you can see past bubbles, ARC, and Bitcoin, which is an interesting one that Bank of America points out here. uh you had uh smaller China in the late uh uh 2010s or 2000s 2007 to 2009 that is going to recur in our view uh over the next two years. There will be a final blowoff for China just like you had the final blowoff for Japan in the late 80s and we're going to benefit from that with Baba. Growth has underperformed value by 7 percentage points so far this year. Uh that was also part of the theme. Value dispersion peaks usually precede value cycles. the cycles we talked about. What's the cycle is making sure you have a manager that's expert in these areas because the cycle value cycle is just beginning. Uh and if you know what you're doing, it's like it's literally like a treasure hunt every single day. Uh value trades well below historic average versus growth. You can see here this is plus or minus two standard deviations. We're probably about halfway there. And then valuation strategies for information technology. Uh price to free cash flow outperformed the index the most over the last uh 45 40 years. And that's buying low price to free cash flow is the name of the game right now. That's not popular. That will come back very very it's already coming back. This year has been the inflection point. Large caps relative performance total return of growth versus value. You can see here this extreme not seen since 2000. And then prior to that 1980 and we know what happened next. Value dramatically outperformed. S&P 500 increasingly topheavy. again top 10 largest S&P companies as a percentage of the S&P almost 40% 38% this will revert in 2000 it was 25% you'll have your people come out and say well this time it's different cap light blah blah blah I heard the same story about eyeballs in 1999 AI is certainly going to change the world just like the internet did the question is how much have you already\nShort interest has risen in 2025 that creates the next buyers which is why I&#39;m been pushing we&#39;re going to new highs before the end of summer. FMS investors are net 38% underweight US equities, the most since May of 2023. This has hockey stick since the beginning of the year. We called this on the podcast aggressively in the fourth quarter of last year. Go back and look at the tapes. More downside for dollar expected. Opinion follows trend. That&#39;s from Bloomberg. Economists raise China growth exports outlook for 2025. composition of the $81 trillion global equity market. You can see here US is 64%. The earnings power is nowhere near that percentage of the overall equity pie and that will revert and we&#39;ve seen the beginnings of that this year. Long emerging markets again one standard deviation below the means. Uh, and the last times you got to this was 20201, which was you never made more money in a shorter period of time than being long emerging markets, small caps in value from 2001 to 2007. Everything&#39;s pointing to the same thing. Very similar. Why did you see a lot of these managers make billions in the 70s when the stock market did nothing? Small caps outperformed. It was a stock picker paradise. Same thing&#39;s going to happen now. Um and by the way, same thing in the second um term of uh Reagan uh in the late 80s from 85 to 90 and early part of Bush one. Target rate probabilities for September 17th meeting up to 64% now. first cut. We covered that on Vney AI. Bulls minus bears. Again, not at extreme. We push higher, ladies and gentlemen. Uh 6 months later on average 10%, one year later, 21%. S&amp;P 500, you can see here, making an aggressive what they call a cup and handle. Measured move would imply 4900 to 6,000 is,00 measured move would imply 7,100 probably by sometime in 2026. Yet another sign this is a bull market. Uh after 2 months of gains in the S&amp;P of 20% or more 1950 to today, one year out on average up 30%, 6 months out on average 16%. Economists expect Germany to grow again this year. that is from negative earnings growth to positive earnings growth starting this year and reacelerating 2026 2027. That helps the European theme that helps our GXO position which we talked about with Stew. Uh by the way, I got some incredible news. I&#39;m going to just skip to it right now. uh literally it must have been either while I was talking to Vney uh or shortly thereafter GXO announces completion of the UK regulatory review of Winkitin acquisition and raises full year 2025 guidance. So this is what I said as one of the two catalyst for GXO to get to 60 before the end of the year and probably more by the way. uh largest pure play contract logistics provider announced that the UK competition markets CMA has cleared GXO&#39;s acquisition of Winkitin subject to the devestment of a small number of Wikington grocery contracts in the UK which is less than probably less than 3% of total revenues of Winkitin uh and that invest integration will be permitted with the vast majority of the Winkutin business once certain administrative conditions are met. The company also announced today that it is raising fullear guidance on organic revenue growth, adjusted IBIDA and adjusted diluted EPS. We are pleased with the regulatory review. Excited to bring the two businesses together combination offering uh customers across the UK, Ireland bring presence in strategic verticals that will serve as a springboard for growth. Well positioned to move forward swiftly and look forward to welcoming the Winkington team to GXO. updated fullear guidance organic revenue growth. Uh the midpoint was brought up to 5% from 4 a.5% organic revenue growth. IBIDA midpoint uh from 850 to 870. So 20 more million of adjusted IBIDA. EPS midpoint 253 from 250 and uh free cash flow conversion to 30% mid-range. So all of this super exciting news. Pretty timely for that interview this morning. Uh better to be lucky than to be good sometimes. So uh earnings of MCI China continue to uh shoot upward. compound annual growth rate over the next seven years expected to be uh let&#39;s see here what are we talking about somewhere around 9 10% US uh with the implication being the value intrinsic value of the businesses off of normalized value multiples would be double off of depressed multiples will probably be quadruple FYI so Um, Goldman holdings in Chinese equities as a percentage of total AUM is uh 1.6% the benchmark is 5% managers are 3.4% underweight Chinese equities. The catch-up is going to be violent violent to the upside if you don&#39;t have it. Uh, can&#39;t help you. An overlooked boom in China. 15 major economies with the highest growth rate of household spending in this century. Uh that game is back on. We&#39;re going to cover a couple of things about that. China&#39;s consumption gets a boost from tradein subsidies, household appliances and video equipment, furniture, communication appliance, automobiles, retail sales. This is called Alibaba is the toll taker. 40 cents of every retail dollar spent on e-commerce goes through Taoba T- Mall. Uh the government has committed to 70% internal consumption. uh and Baba is best positioned to take advantage of that. Particularly the middle class Timu and that garbage PDD got uh a share of the pie when people were poor during COVID and bought garbage. Now that the middle class is reemerging and getting their confidence back, Taoba Teeal controls the middle class spend and is the preeminent toll taker. International stock seen as the best asset class over the next five years. uh opinion follows trend. It&#39;s amazing when you have 15 percentage of outperformance. Goldman Sachs top down S&amp;P 500 forecast 12 months out 6500. So that&#39;s opinion follows trend. They went down when the market went down. Now they&#39;re back up. They blow like a you know in California now I understand blowing like like the wind like a palm tree in the wind. Uh that&#39;s most of the sell side earnings growth. And by the way, that&#39;s why they keep their jobs. If they were like an oak tree, uh and they and they fought the wind, they would snap. Uh these guys blow with the wind. So like a palm tree, they always bounce back and keep their jobs. uh earnings growth proform earnings uh year-over-year. You can see uh unmagnificent 493 accelerating mag 7 collapsing. That&#39;s not new. We&#39;ve covered that almost every week. China retail sales year reacelerating like we haven&#39;t seen since 2022 and prior to that uh 2020 when all the equities were off the charts. game is just beginning. Retail flows have recently been stronger than average and they&#39;ve been right. Okay, by the way, they were uh buying the dip in COVID uh international relative to the rest of the world stocks since 1950. So, you can see here this concentration that&#39;s going to get smacked already has this year. It&#39;s going to continue to get smacked when you have this concentration like you saw in 2019. And most people don&#39;t know that they&#39;re still stuck in this and they&#39;re all on one side of the boat about to get drowned um because they think they own 500 stocks and they don&#39;t understand what a cap weight it is index is relative to an equal weight uh relative to exposure to a manager that specializes in the green area which is looking through the windshield versus the rear view mirror. Median twoe S&amp;P 500 return since 1950. uh second half of June. Okay. Tends to be weak. We&#39;ll see what happens. GS social I I I think we pulled forward a lot of the weakness that was supposed to happen in June and got it in um April and May, but let&#39;s see. GS social media economic sentiment index starting to move back up. FMS most underweight the US dollar in 20 years. This goes all the way back to the early 2000s, which was when what happened? International outperformed, value outperformed, small caps outperformed. What do you know? Retail investors have been selling in the last three weeks. Uh, every single consistent. Okay. Well, it&#39;s something to keep an eye on. Household allocation to US equities across global regions. US has the most concentration, which means they&#39;re overweight. those seven stocks, which by the way, the carry trade continues to unwind. We&#39;ve warned you about that. And all that hot money is coming out of those seven stocks. Underweight China, that will play catchup. More opinion follows trend. Stock market around breath thrust, which we just had 12 months later on average up 15.5%. So basically, here we are. Here&#39;s where we have to go after this level of breath thrust for the technicians out there. Investor allocation to equities at an all-time high which basically means still mag seven because of the waitings even though the earnings growth is collapsing in those kind of call it 10 names central underweight debt which is going to change now the demand for treasuries is going up. Uh Bowen and Bessant are going to get the uh SLR intact probably in coming weeks. The Genius Act was passed yesterday that&#39;ll create another trillion dollars of demand to two trillion of demand of treasuries over the next two years. Uh the game is on and then uh Trump will probably start to appoint or announce uh trial balloon names of new Fed chair. So that will act as what we call a shadow Fed chair. So Powell has effectively made himself a lame duck uh for the remainder of his term once Trump starts to announce a you know very throw very dovish names out there. The market will start to discount 100 to 200 basis points of immediate cuts uh that will come into play May of 2026. It&#39;ll start to discount it uh the third or fourth quarter of this year. So be on the lookout for that. central bank cuts at fastest pace in 2025 last month. Everyone except for Powell. Too late Powell. Um and that&#39;s that. He&#39;ll he&#39;ll he&#39;ll get away with it. He&#39;ll set the table in in Jackson Hole. He&#39;ll do the first cut in September and probably second in December and then he will be off to play congressional five days a week. I hear he&#39;s a pretty good golfer by the way. Um S&amp;P price to sales over time. Again, this is skewed by those 10 names. Decade worth of volatility in the 2020s. Uh that&#39;s interesting. Wow. More volat almost double the volatility of the 70s. The stories I heard about the 70s. That&#39;s pretty wild. Consumer balance sheet very healthy. $190 trillion of assets, $20 trillion of liabilities. That&#39;s pretty damn healthy. Fed call as of 610 2025. There&#39;s a lot of room to lever up once they get the rates under control. Powell&#39;s just kind of delaying things, but it is what it is. Fed call as of 610. That&#39;s immaterial. Results for buying S&amp;P on the last day of loss exceeds 12%. No one cares. cumulative retail sales January through May. Total short interest ticking up. So, last time we saw short interest get this high was like the the whole in 2016 and you had a monster rally the next couple of years. Um, you know, these guys are forced buyers. this amount of short interest the whole way up from 2020 from 2022 higher. They just kept shorting and shorting shorting. So now they&#39;re going to be forced buyers as this thing pushes to new highs. Huge move into Euro zone and emerging markets out of US and US dollar. We&#39;ve been calling for that for a while. into the euro, into healthcare, by the way, into industrials, slowly out of tech, out of Japan, uh, out of the US dollar. Record high foreign ownership of the US stock market that&#39;s starting to decline, underweight energy, we see it in the comm stocks, Christmas in July, NASDAQ&#39;s 12-day midyear rally. So markets tend to have a massive rally in the first 12 trading days of July. You do not want to get short ahead of that. If you want to lighten up, do so after alltime highs sometime in August. But basically, it just grinds sideways till the end of year rally or net. Uh Russell 1000 versus Russell 2000. This is large cap versus small cap. This is going to mean revert like nobody&#39;s business. We have not been at this level of an extreme since 2001. Hold on to your seat belts. If you don&#39;t have small cap exposure, just, you know, look, all this is opinion, not advice, but at least get yourself uh an ETF if you don&#39;t have a manager who can pick the best stocks for you.

Companies that reduce shares at low valuations tend to outperform annualized performance 1986 to 2025. Uh the per the the greatest example of this under the sun is what Alibaba did buying back stock between $60 and $80. I mean they couldn&#39;t have done any better. I&#39;d say another one that did a good job was 10 cent. It&#39;s amazing these Chinese companies, they were smart enough to have cash reserves and they were twice as smart to deploy them in the hole when everyone was ducked under the desk. And uh you know now these stocks are up 100% and not even starting to move yet. They&#39;re the the beginning of their moves is just now. Um but they did the exact right thing. You rarely see that with US managers. What you see with US managers unfortunately is after the stock has had you know a huge run 4x 5x they start buying back stocks so they can sell their ESOP plans into the liquidity created by the company which is you know a crime. It&#39;s it&#39;s not a literal crime. It&#39;s a figurative crime and it&#39;s ripping you off as as owners. But uh it is what it is. Companies that reduce shares at low. Okay. Valuation matters. It didn&#39;t it just didn&#39;t for the 2010s. Uh so if you go back IBIDA enterprise value dramatically outperform from 86 to 2006. We&#39;ve been through this and that&#39;s that on the data front. So, a lot of great stuff there. Some\n\nCompanies that reduce shares at low valuations tend to outperform annualized performance 1986 to 2025.

We put the summary out on Tuesday. 22 222 managers running 587 billion AUM. Here are the top five points. Opinion follows trend. 54% of managers now expect international stocks to be the best performing over the next 5 years. You couldn't give away an international stock in Q4 when we were pounding the table. Managers are now the most underweight. The US dollar uh they&#39;ve been since 20 years. What was the narrative last year? King dollar. Materials and energy remain unloved with managers net 26% underweight. energy up from last month&#39;s record low allocation and 15% underweight materials. Uh there&#39;s your com stock and Albamaro just getting started. Four of the doomsday recession expectations we saw in April have collapsed, reversing from 42% of managers saying global recession was likely to now a net 36% saying it is unlikely. Trapped bears continue to fuel the pain trade to the upside. And five managers are 28% net overweight emerging market equities. How you like that? 28% overweight emerging market equities, up from last month&#39;s net 11% and the highest allocation since August 2023. Here&#39;s Albamaro. Each week we try to cover one to two companies we&#39;ve discussed in previous podcast vidcast uh and or own for clients including personally. So you can see here free cash flows recovering but still lagging prices doing exactly what it should based on that. Our favorite theme heading into 2025 was the last shall be first with healthcare and materials as our top two sectors. Both had been left for dead after posting anemic returns in 2024, but earnings for the two were expected to recover handsomely in 2025. Healthcare was projected to grow by 20.7, materials by 18.9, both ranking among top four overall sectors. Six months into the year, healthcare has largely held up, now projected to deliver 14.5% earnings growth and rank third overall. Materials stumbled out of the gates partially on the tariffs. uh took it on the chin from tariffs with earnings growth now expected to be 7.8%. Uh but as they say, being too early is indistinguish from being wrong. Uh that&#39;s exactly how this one has played out so far with the materials recovery looking more like a 2026 story. Uh and if we zoom out, the delay in the recovery could end up being more like a blessing in disguise. That&#39;s because our number one pick for the theme is Albamaro, a position that at the time wasn&#39;t large enough yet because the price had run away from us. We don&#39;t buy up and we&#39;re hoping to get a second bite at the apple. Luckily, we&#39;ve gotten the opportunity served on a silver platter to size in accordingly. Albamaro is the world&#39;s largest and lowest cost lithium producer. The roller coaster story of lithium over the past 5 years goes something like this. Demand went through the roof in 2021 and through 2022 as the EV and renewables boom took off in full force. Automakers were scaling production and stockpile on lithium. All while supply was heavily constrained from years of underinvestment and logistical bottlenecks. This perfect storm sent prices up more than eight 8x, reaching all-time highs of north of 80,000 per metric ton. And Albamaro was minting more cash than they knew what to do with. But the high prices quickly brought a wave of new supply. Small-cale producers in China, many fully subsidized, flooded the market and created massive supply glut. Lithium prices came crashing down. uh and Albamaro&#39;s stock fell with them down more than 80% to where it is today. The good news for Albamaro is that as we mentioned they are the largest and lowest cost producer worldwide. This has allowed them to cut operating costs in capex and pretty much sit on their hands and wait for cycllically low lithium prices to recover. Meanwhile, the longer prices stay in the pain zone, the more lowquality marginal producers will get taken out on a stretcher. To put this into context, Albamaro Management estimates that 40% of global current lithium capacity is at or below break even only with onethird of that supply having come on coming off having come offline so far. This should continue to support Albamaro and lithium prices from the supply side with analysts expecting the supply glut to shrink and largely be gone by 2026. So with supply starting to dry up and marginal producers coming offline, this the focus now shifts to the other side of the equation, demand. And what becomes immediately clear is that demand has never been the issue for lithium. It has gone up and to the right with no signs of slowing with consensus still calling for 15 to 20% kagger over the next decade. Meanwhile, all the noise about slowing EV growth in North America still up 17% yearonear has created a catharsis among investors. That but that completely misses the point. The reality is that North America accounts for just 10% of global EV sales. The real story is China, which makes up more than 60% of the market. It&#39;s a government subsidized market, and the government will not stop when it has its mind set on something, and just posted a 41% growth in the first quarter. Meanwhile, while everyone stays focused on the EV narrative, they are missing what may be the biggest shift happening under the surface. Data centers and stationary storage. Just a few years ago, this segment was expected to make up around 5% of total lithium demand. Today, projections are closer to 30%. Few weeks ago, Ken Hoffman, shout out by the way to Brad\nKen Hoffman is an expert in lithium and battery materials, formerly at McKenzie, laid out the case for a lithium recovery. He sees the bottom in 2025 and a gradual recovery starting in 2026. prices reaching 15 to 20,000 per metric ton by year end. While the market obsesses over the temporary supply glut, Hoffman&#39;s thesis is built on something you won&#39;t hear anyone else, underappreciated demand. He projects global demand could reach 6 to 10 million metric tonses by 2035. We&#39;ve been talking about it going from 1.2 to 3.2. So, if this happens, this thing could be a five bagger. But let&#39;s just be realistic here. Um, or conservative again. Demand in 2024 was about 1.2 million and Alba Mar&#39;s high-end forecast for 2030 is 3.3. That&#39;s in line with our forecast. This guy&#39;s talking double or triple that. And we see a threebagger just on on the conservative estimates. If that scenario plays out, Albero isn&#39;t just a double, it&#39;s a multiagger. \n### FEATURED_COMPANY_DEEP_DIVES\nNow on to Albero earnings. Here&#39;s everything you need to know following the Q1 report. You can go through this step by step. Uh break even free cash flow in 2025. That&#39;s key in trough prices. is the fact that they can be break even. By the way, this is a dividend aristocrat. They&#39;ve raised a dividend every single year for over 30 years. Uh that&#39;s going to continue to happen. You can lock in a very uh low basis so that um as the dividend, you know, you&#39;ll lock in whatever it is 2 and a half or 3% whatever it is now. But even as the price goes up, the dividend yield on your basis is going to keep going up as they keep increasing the dividend. And then if you reinvest it, you can really compound money. Anyway, here are the 10 key points. Through April, management achieved 90% run rate against the midpoint of their 350 million cost and productivity savings program. More importantly, they&#39;ve identified additional opportunities to reach the high end of 300 to $400 million range with potential for even more upside. Adjusted Ebida margins in Q1 came in at 25% up 400 basis points year-on-year in a trough cycle. This is unbelievable. With SGNA costs down over 20% as the cost savings program continues to bear fruit. Three, in light of cycllically low prices, management continues to cut back on capex with full year 2025 expectations of 700 to 800 million, down more than 50% year-on-year. This comes down from an already low base in 2024. That was reduced by over 450 million compared to 2023&#39;s 2.1 billion of capex. The long-term midcycle capex target remains around 6% of revenues. cash from operations uh in Q1 totaled four $545 million including a 350 million customer prepayment resulting in an operating cash flow conversion of 204% excluding the prepaid pay payment conversion still came in at 73% above above the long-term average of 60 or 70% bringing fullear 2025 expectations to north of 80% five not only did management maintain their full year 2025 outlook they also reiterated their expectation of break even free cash flow for for the year after delivering slightly positive free cash flow in Q1 with positive free cash flow expected during 2026. Six, the direct impact of tariffs is expected to be minimal, totaling 30 to 40 million for the full year before any mitigations. This is largely due to Albamaro&#39;s global footprint with most lithium production sold directly to Asia and the critical mineral exemptions that are currently in place. Management has mitigations underway to significantly reduce the overall realized impact, including increased sales to lower tariff countries and optimizing supply chain. Seven management has estimated that 40% of the current global lithium capacity is at or below break even with only a third of that supply having come offline. Aka the number of the longer prices remain in the pain zone the more lowquality marginal producers will get taken out on a stretcher. Eight for the full year lithium demand is expected to grow between 15 to 40% with management currently forecasting growth around the mid 20% range. Long-term demand growth remains strong with lithium demand projected to more than 2x 2030 from 1.2 million metric tonses in 2024 and up to 3.3 million metric tonses growing at a near 20% kagger. Despite the headline noise, global EV demand continues to remain strong, up 34% yearonear. Strong sales in China continue to weigh lead the way up up 41% year-onear and remain over 60% of the total EV global EV market. Long-term demand expectations remained intact with EV market penetration expected to exceed IC by the end of the decade reaching about 54% global penetration and 10 stationary storage continues to be one of the main drivers for lithium. The market is expected to grow at 20 to 30% kagger through 2030. Uh growing from 190 to in 2024 to between 600 and 970 in 2030. Earnings call highlights you can go through at hedge funtips.com. And then um here&#39;s an article from Morning Star with a fair value. Lithium prices will rebound then remain well above the marginal cost of production through the at least the remainder of decade leading to excess profits and return on invested capital for Albamaro. Therefore, they have a $200 fair value on the stock down from 225. The stock is trading at about $60 right now. So, they&#39;re looking at a threebagger plus uh in a handful of years or less. I think it&#39;s going to be more and uh we&#39;re excited about it. So, that&#39;s that.\n\nmanagement has mitigations underway to significantly reduce the overall realized impact, including increased sales to lower tariff countries and optimizing supply chain.

Now, we&#39;re going to move on to the ask me anything\n\n### ASK_ME_ANYTHING_QA\nquestions  for those of you get a lot of value from\n\nNate Kelsey uh your podcasts have been extremely educational and I&#39;ve looked forward to the weekly updates for more than two years now. Big beautiful bill currently under consideration includes a roll off of solar tax credit. Okay, so he&#39;s asking about Nphase. I&#39;ve been asked about Nphase every week for the last two years. I&#39;ve continued to say no. It&#39;s continued to go lower. Um, you know, these stocks did do well under Trump 1.0. So, counterintuitively and energy stocks did not. and PH the problem is I think all their balance sheets are toast and if there&#39;s going to be no subsidies uh from the government I mean that that&#39;s the big thing that&#39;s why Elon got pissed is because the bill guts all the climate spend and um so they&#39;ve got some free cash flow how&#39;s this balance sheet 1.6 billion of cash, $1.2 billion of debt. Yeah, I mean the big problem with this is, you know, it was a 300 bagger off the lows. It is a broken growth stock. It&#39;s going to take an awfully long time to build a new set of shareholders. And looking at the financials, I think it looks okay, but I&#39;m not inclined to do anything with this at the moment, but I am inclined to start to do some work on it. So, I&#39;ll leave it there, but uh nothing really exciting about that.\n### ASK_ME_ANYTHING_QA\nYork Bourgeoa, uh hope your week has been going well. I had a question regarding your approach of enterprise value versus equity value. Wondering what you valued more, especially Thank that&#39;s not it&#39;s not even a framework way to think about it. You always have to consider enterprise value uh debt plus equity minus cash uh because that&#39;s total capital invested and you have to consider the total return on invested capital. Uh I do look at equity value. I tend to favor that a little bit more as an equity investor but I also analyze it on the basis of enterprise value because I want to I want to calculate total capital and the return on total capital. So, um I don&#39;t think it&#39;s relevant to getting the outcome that&#39;s going to give you alpha, but I do think you need to do both is the answer to your question. Kyler Johnson, uh I don&#39;t touch this one. Focus right ticker tune. Let&#39;s take a look at that. Uh, right. It&#39;s not a US stock, I guess. T N E. Yeah, it&#39;s British stock. All right, cool. [Music] Wow. Complete round trip. Let&#39;s see. [Music] Huh? I mean this is a tiny business. Uh what do they do for let&#39;s say 28 million? All right. What do they actually do development manufacturer market professional audio and electric music products? [Music] This is a niche tiny little small cap business. Um, yeah. I just don&#39;t know the business. I mean, you really have to understand what is their mo what&#39;s their competitive advantage. Is this the go-to? Like, no one really competes with them for these products. Are they that good? Why is growth slowown so much? What&#39;s the plan to reacelerate? Or does every guitar player already have one of these synthesizers? But I do like that the turnaround story looks interesting for sure. Um I just I would just have to have confidence in the product and understand the moat, which I don&#39;t think I&#39;m ever going to have a real edge on. Uh but if you do, you know, know what you own, I think you got something here. You just really have to go through all the public filings and the last maybe eight conference calls, see what management has said, see what they&#39;ve done, see what they&#39;re promising, how are they going to turn around, how are they going to reacelerate growth, and you might have something here. So, I think uh I think Kyler Johnson is on to something and finding a niche opportunity there that may turn out to be something good for him. So, good work. Uh let&#39;s move to the next one. Mark Callaway, thanks for all you do. I sing your praises to anyone who will listen and they all thank me for it later. Well, thank you for that. By the way, uh very grateful for your support and uh tuning in each week. If you&#39;re getting value, which I know so many of you are from the beautiful notes that you send in uh and testimonials which you can find on the website and on the YouTube uh every week on the videos. All I can ask is one, at the very least, go to YouTube and write a um uh comment and give your feedback. That helps push it up. The more people that view this, the longer we&#39;re going to do it for non-clients. Um uh you know, like, subscribe to the channel. Just go to YouTube, type in the search bar hedge fun tips. The hedge fun tip channel will come up. And then the best compliment you could pay me uh if you&#39;re not a client or not able to do business with us uh is to share it with one person you like and loves and you know loves markets and would really benefit from this framework and help them make a lot of money. So um grateful for you doing that and um I invite the rest of you uh if you want to give back that&#39;s that&#39;s one great way to do it. Uh so his question is do you think Coinbase entering the payment market for e-commerce and Robin Hood rumored to do so in the fall will affect PayPal? Uh I PayPal has such a mode at this point that the amount of stock they&#39;re going to buy in 20% of the company. Uh they are the sixth largest stable coin. I&#39;m watching that part of the business. They have margin recovery. Alex Chris what he created at into it running 50% of the revenues. Multi multi multibagger. Uh, I&#39;d bet on Alex Chris way before I bet on either of these two CEOs. As much as the success that they&#39;ve had, Coinbase, I think, is going to get commoditized at some point. Uh, brokerages, uh, uh, everyone&#39;s super excited about Robin Hood, uh, and it&#39;s had a good run, and Vlad seems to be a good CEO, but all of that gets gets mar the margins just get eroded. The brokerage business has never been a durable competitive moat that doesn&#39;t get competed away over time. Robin Hood and Coinbase will be no different. Uh so yeah, I I continue to like PayPal over those. Sagar Kaya curious your preference about Intel over AMD. Uh very simple. How many fabs does AMD have in Arizona or Ohio? And that&#39;s all you need to know is that the government, whether they like Intel or hate Intel, needs Intel. And we need to produce chips in the US. Yes, Taiwan Semiconductor uh has fabs, but they&#39;re going to need unlimited numbers. And in Intel has the 5-year runway. This will be one of the greatest hockey stick stories from most hated to most loved in the shortest period of time. When it turns, it&#39;s going to turn all at once. uh AMD there&#39;s too much downside. I understand what the upside is, but the downside is material and there&#39;s nothing to back them up because there&#39;s nothing they have that their customers can&#39;t find another solution elsewhere. Whereas Intel, once their fabs are rolling, they&#39;re going to have a US duopoly with TSMC. So that&#39;s that. But you you&#39;ll notice that a number of these\n\n### ASK_ME_ANYTHING_QA\nthink Coinbase entering the payment market for e-commerce and Robin Hood rumored to do so in the fall will affect PayPal?

But you you&#39;ll notice that a number of these\n\n### HEADLINES_AND_NEWS\nquestions , just note the names and what was in the headlines\n\n### HEADLINES_AND_NEWS\n\n### ASK_ME_ANYTHING_QA\nPaul Girtz. Hey, Paul. Uh could you look at Clorox? Yeah, we&#39;ve looked at this one. We do like this one. I&#39;m not sold on the CEO. she&#39;s kind of been fussing around FUTZ uh for too long. So, I would like to see a replacement of the CEO if that hasn&#39;t already happened. But yeah, this is a long-term compounder with a moat. Um that&#39;s just been a little bit mismanaged of late. So, free cash flow. I mean, look, the revenues haven&#39;t begun to recover. Margins are recovering. Uh, I I I think I think this one is probably fine here. If you could get it at a 100 bucks or 110 bucks, that would be even better. But I think for the long term, this one&#39;s generally going to be okay. And I like the thing. It&#39;s one that keeps popping up that I&#39;m not doing anything with because it&#39;s not an easy double in a reasonable amount of time, but um I think you&#39;ll get nice returns and um pretty handsome dividend while you wait if I&#39;m not mistaken. Let me just see here. four 4% dividend yield while you wait. My guess, let&#39;s see what they&#39;ve been doing with the dividend.\nSimon Stazzy, Icon Enterprises, no thank you. Where there&#39;s smoke, there might be fire. absolute legend, but there was too much intercomp financial chicainery going. I&#39;m not interested, even though I love what he&#39;s done over the years. I love his framework. Uh, that one makes me a little nervous. Uh, stumbled upon Zeta Global. Let&#39;s take a look. Lucas. [Music] Well, All right. So, first thing I want to figure out is why the margins have come down so much. Let&#39;s take a look at uh let&#39;s take a look at All right. So, the revenues are growing like a weed. I mean what the share count&#39;s gone from 31 million to 186 million. So congratulations they so okay so revenues have grown 3x the share count has grown uh 6x. So the share counts grown twice the pace of the revenue and the business. What&#39;s cash flow done? Forex balance sheet&#39;s probably clean. Yeah, I just I do not like that kind of growth in in the share count [Music] marketing automation. Yeah. Uh, no. I I just don&#39;t think I mean I have no confidence in knowing they&#39;re not going to take the share count to 700 million. So I Yeah, I I don&#39;t I don&#39;t like these type of managements. So not for me. Uh John H loving the podcast. Pittney Bose. No, no. There&#39;s a lot of people promoting Pney Bows and the story&#39;s changed and it looks better, blah, blah, blah. It&#39;s not for me. [Music] And it&#39;s already moved anyway, so you&#39;re kind of late. Let&#39;s take a look at the story here. We We&#39;ve done this one before. I I I don&#39;t like it. I know the business has changed. I know they&#39;ve got all this story about how it&#39;s going to be better. They have this every five years, and every five years it&#39;s the exact same result. pops up, insiders sell stock, reverts back. Not for me. Uh, Eric C, love listening to your podcast. Do you think Merc is doing more? Fears of the two products having competition. Generic&#39;s not doing well. Ah, I Yeah, I I keep looking at Mkin doing nothing, but I think it&#39;s probably ready. it. Yeah, it just hasn&#39;t come in enough for me to get super interested, but it&#39;s on my watch list. I&#39; I&#39;d be a pass here. I&#39; I needed to come down more before I&#39;d get interested, and it may not do. So, Tommo of the podcast. Uh, what small caps? We We Jack, we&#39;ve already covered like Comtock, we&#39;ve covered uh Cooper Standard, we&#39;ve I mean, we have a lot of small caps. Um, we own Canada Goose is a tiny position. So, all the small caps we&#39;ve covered. Otherwise, just buy an emer uh small cap uh ETF. Opinion not advice, but you got to get exposure to small caps and just don&#39;t think about it for the next three to five years. Matt Dell Priori, uh, I covered this somewhat recently, but have you thought about Nike? Yes, I&#39;ve thought about it and I have VF Corp is a better uh, riskreward. I mean, Nike is probably going to take longer than everyone thinks. Uh, Nike could be a double or triple. I think it&#39;s going to take five years. I think VF Corp can be a multibagger in three or less. So, for that reason, I I think Nike is good here. I We&#39;re just We&#39;re just not going to own it at the moment. We higher and better use. Raph Goldburn safe store in the UK. Um, s a fe.l. All right. Cut in half. Free cash flow peaked three years ago along pretty much along with revenues. Return on capitals continued to erode. Margins have continued to erode. What do they do? They are self storage group 209 stores. Yeah, I I have no edge on this because I don&#39;t know what the supply demand situation is on that. Um, you&#39;d really have to study the industry to to have an informed opinion on that. Uh, let me just see something here. Again, this is a broken growth stock, but it may be it may be close. Let&#39;s just take a look. I&#39;m sure there&#39;s Yeah, I mean, there&#39;s a billion dollars of debt. It&#39;s supported by the assets, but you&#39;re cutting it. What&#39;s happening with the free cash flow? Yeah, it&#39;s pretty steady. I I don&#39;t really have an edge on that business in Europe, so for that reason, I&#39;d probably pass. But it might be worth you doing more work if if uh you think there&#39;s an opportunity there. Let&#39;s just see here. Yeah, just just you might have something. It&#39;s not something that I would look at, but I appreciate you sending it in. Joshua Kaplan Sprouts Farmers Market SFM. This has always been a bad business, but let&#39;s see what it looks like now. [Music] Looks like it&#39;s recovering. SFM. Wow. Wow. Wow. Wow. Wow. Wow. This is absolutely I mean the [Music] What I can tell you is supermarkets are never a good business. So you have a run here, you&#39;re expanding, everything looks good. Eventually, you&#39;re going to hit a brick wall and you&#39;re going to crash just like you see in the Tik Tok memes where the where the 18-wheeler, you know, tests like a Land Rover test a Tesla and they all smash into the wall like an accordion. That&#39;s what happens when you own uh grocery store stock. So, I would I would just uh avoid it like the plague. It&#39;s almost as bad as airlines, except airlines you can buy cyclical troughs if their balance sheets are okay and play make a quick double or triple. But uh uh supermarkets are just bad news. So I I wouldn&#39;t touch it. James Deers, unless you think that you&#39;re going to get a lot of inflation, uh and their inventory value goes up, but that&#39;s that&#39;s a sucker game. I wouldn&#39;t play it. Uh Tom, appreciate your wise uh council opinion. Thanks for all you do. Uh wondering if you&#39;d have time to talk to Jeff Edwards about the China tease that he gave on the previous interview. Yeah, look, everything he needed to say was on there. The business is great. Be patient. Stop looking at price on a day basis. You&#39;ll be fine. Um, and by the way, you&#39;re already up four 4x, so chillax. Um, sorry it&#39;s not 10x in two minutes, but thank you for the question. Um, UD Audit, thanks for all the great insights for your podcast. You&#39;re just amazing. Thank you very much, Odd. That&#39;s very nice. Um, safe doubles, triples. Yeah, Dagio and Crown Castle. Absolutely fine. Uh, Terry S and we own both of them. Thank you for your content and hosting the podcast. Love it. Question. How can I learn to analyze and see markets like you do? Uh, 20 years in the business. Uh, listen to the podcast every week. Get your CFA I think is key. if you&#39;re young. Um, Warren Buffett&#39;s annual letters, must readad books is intelligent investor by Ben Graham for starters. And we&#39;ve covered like lists of like 10 or 20 books in the past. But that&#39;s the starting point and then go from there. Enjoy the journey. You&#39;ll find out after reading the intelligent investor whether this is what you should do with your life. Uh, if you&#39;re just joining because you think it&#39;s going to be a great way to only a great way to make money, I would go into another business, be an entrepreneur. If you&#39;re joining because it&#39;s what you want to do 247, um then you might have a chance after 10 or 20 years to get an edge and find your own unique style that um that can deliver value for your clients. Uh John Martin, Omegalex, gas piping in residential construction. O F L X. This business is low quality. OF LX and very very small. [Music] margins are holding up. Let me just see here. Pretty good balance sheet. I mean, the revenues haven&#39;t gone anywhere in six years. They&#39;re actually down. So, I just don&#39;t know what the growth story is from a stock perspective. Um, share counts been pretty steady. I mean, this is the kind of business that 20 million of free cash flow, [Music] 4% dividend yield. They don&#39;t expect growth either, paying out that kind of dividend. So you&#39;re paying enterprise value is 282 million for 20 million of free cash flow for a flat flattish business that shows no signs of growth. Uh yeah, it has definitely operating leverage relative to housing recovery, but I want to start to understand the turnaround story from management before I even look at it. I I think I mean this could easily go to 10 before it starts to recover. So management better start to show some signs of recovery because if it&#39;s if it&#39;s going to continue to have flat to negative revenue and financials, uh there&#39;s no telling how low it can go. It it had its run. It&#39;s a broken stock. You know, here we are five years later. It fits with the theme, but it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s too small of a business that it&#39;s there&#39;s no there&#39;s no moat. It&#39;s not like it was huge and it got hit, but everyone still needs their products. This is like a hundred million dollar business. It&#39;s like if if it ceased to exist tomorrow, it wouldn&#39;t affect anyone. If like Cooper Standard ceased to exist, it would hurt a lot of OEMs. It would like delay their lines, all the value ad that they&#39;ve done. So, I don&#39;t see why this business needs to exist, but at some price, it makes sense. I just don&#39;t know if this is the price yet. And you&#39;d have to listen to four to eight conference calls and really understand why and how they believe they can turn this around and it better be uh unassalable.\nEmil Bamante, any plans to get some exposure to rapidly growing commercial space industry? Already have it through Boeing? Uh Dave Burgerer, thoughts on Boston Beer Company, Hard Pass? Uh, Mark Dory 212 Retail UK brokerage. Uh, I I don&#39;t like the brokerage business at all. Even as excited as everyone is about Robin Hood and crypto and all that stuff, it&#39;s not what I say. Uh, you didn&#39;t send me a ticker, so I&#39;m going to pass on this one. I I just don&#39;t like the brokerage business generally. Cork Snyder uh talked about Ray Dallio a bit. Why his countries go broke? He&#39;s sees America blah blah blah. Uh we&#39;re in the 2030s we begin to have issues due to population issues. Yeah. Look, Cork, uh here&#39;s what I can tell you. When the music is playing, get up and dance. I think the music is going to be playing at least to 2030 and beyond. Uh and uh if Dalio&#39;s pessimistic about the 2030s, I tend to agree, but by then we&#39;ll have made so much money and cashed out uh and be sitting in cash and defensive in the early 2030s when the population falls off in the US that uh we&#39;ll be buying bargains like it&#39;s going out of style from probably 2034 to 2040 uh and God willing and um and make an absolute killing on on uh beyond that. But but for now, like that&#39;s so far off. I don&#39;t you know, Dalio predicting the 2030s are going to be bad.

    "### MEDIA_APPEARANCE_RECAP": "\n\nWant to thank Christian Dagger and the great Stuart Vney for having me on Fox Business this morning to talk the Fed, talk a couple picks, talk a couple names, talk a little bit of outlook. We&#39;re going to listen in here. Remember, the markets are closed for the Junth holiday. Dow&#39;s off 300, NASDAQ&#39;s down 200 points. Tom Hayes joins me now to check out the market even though it&#39;s closed today. All right, Tom. Uh Trump says that J. pow at the Fed should lower rates right now. Is he right? He&#39;s not only right, he&#39;s been right every single step of the way, Stu, about too late Powell. So, the good news is we&#39;re going to get two cuts this year. 64% chance starting in September. They&#39;ll probably set the table at Jackson Hole. The bad news is in the meantime we&#39;re paying 200 basis points above inflation in terms of our debt service which equates to about $600 billion a year. Who pays that Stu? We pay that as taxpayers. It&#39;s completely unnecessary. You know who else is getting hurt from this wrong-minded policy? The millennials. 72 million millennials are trying to start a house, a family, family formation. They can&#39;t do it at 7.25% 25% 30-year fixed rate mortgage. Home builders can&#39;t take the risk with their capital at 7% uh and speculate that people are going to buy it. They&#39;ll just sit there in inventory. We need to come down 200 basis points. And President Trump has made the case if he&#39;s right about his prediction that inflation is going up, he can always hype 25 basis points. It&#39;s much easier to quell inflation than to deal with deflation or unemployment by being too late. Maybe this is a technical question, but the president wants one full percentage point drop in interest rates. If he did that, would the yield on the 10-year Treasury come down one full percentage point, 100 basis points, and would that lead to a drop in the mortgage rate of one full percentage point? Well, they can issue shortterm notes. So, that can bring down financing costs. As far as the long end of the curve, uh, uh, Secretary Bessant is working on that with bank capital requirements this summer. They&#39;ll they&#39;ll create a lot of demand for banks to hold treasuries once again. Uh, they can issue on the short short end and do an operation twist type of situation where they buy in the long end of the curve, bring down 10-year yields, bring down 30-year fixed rate mortgages. And by the way, I I I don&#39;t know if Powell will be will be successful, but I do think Bessant will be successful in bringing down the 10-year yield, which is going to bring mortgage rates below 6% before the end of the year, and that&#39;s going to be a good thing, as well as the stable coin demand for treasuries, the bill that was just passed yesterday, the Genius Act. Okay, you brought two stock picks with you. We got to get through them fast. Uh, first off, GXO Logistics. GXO. Yes. This is a Brad Jacobs company. The last Brad Jacobs company I came to your audience with two months ago was QXO. It&#39;s up 65% in the last two months. This one we believe is just taking off. It&#39;s a worldwide logistics company. Two catalysts. Number one, the CEO announced he was retiring several months back. So, we&#39;re going to get an announcement of a new CEO. That&#39;s going to be a positive catalyst. And number two, on June 25th, the CMA, the UK regulatory body, is going to rule on their Winkitin acquisition whether or not they need to divest the grocery business. The grocery business is only 6% of the revenues of Winkitin. So once that is completed, they can integrate, get the cost synergies, generate over 800 million of IBIDA this year. We think the stock&#39;s going from 42 to over 60 before the end of the year. Uh that&#39;s a good one. Okay. And the second one I got for you, you&#39;ve only got you got 20 seconds cuz we&#39;re almost out of time. Albamar, lithium miner. Albamar, go.

He&#39;s founder, chairman, and managing member of Great Hill Capital. Welcome back to the show, Thomas. Uh first off, I&#39;d like to get your reaction to the decision. Uh it was expected, but is the Fed getting it right? I don&#39;t think they are. I think Powell has unintentionally put him him himself in the position of being a lame duck for the remainder of his term. I think you&#39;re going to see President Trump start to allude to the next Fed chair which will create a shadow Fed situation which is going to be a dovish Fed moving forward. And I think President Trump made a couple important points today. Number one is Powell is about 200 basis points too restrictive. meaning the Fed funds rate is about 200 basis points more than inflation and that&#39;s going going to catch up and the the concept of too late Powell uh whether you love it or don&#39;t love it, President Trump has been right every single time and I think this this situation is going to be the case this time. That&#39;s the bad news. The good news is Powell was slightly more dovish. It originally looked as if the meeting was hawkish, but he did adjust language from the firming language to the adjustments language. And I would say one last thing, Diego, is that uh the Fed is supposed to be data dependent. And the whole meeting was about him predicting that inflation was going to go up because of tariffs, even though that simply was not the case in 2018. And I think pal uh President Trump has made the point in past appearances where he said, &quot;Listen, why don&#39;t you just cut and if you&#39;re right about inflation, you can always raise rates. He could always do a 25 or 50 point raise if inflation ticks up from tariffs.&quot; But if he&#39;s wrong, he&#39;s certainly going to be too late. And that is a risk to the economy. And uh and somewhat reflected in the projections, they&#39;re still projecting two cuts towards the end of the year. If they&#39;re so sure about that, why don&#39;t they just go ahead with it? Yeah, there was a lot of caution about the effect of tariffs uh during Powell&#39;s speech today and his uh and while he fielded uh journalist\n\n### MACRO_DATA_SLIDES\nlong only funds cyclical versus defensive positioning is very low versus history. So when we think about cyclicals think consumer discretionary like the the VF corpse etc. Energy tech industrials like the Generax like the Stanley Black & Deckers materials like the Albamaro tech like the Intels. We're going to talk about some developments there. Hedge funds are underweight cyclicals relative to defensives. always want to take the other side of the trade where the boat is crowded. Relative positioning at historic lows, which means we're going to see rip your face off moves uh in these baskets, which we have great exposure to. US dollar early stage secular bare market deterioration of the US government balance sheet, Fed policy, credibility and independence, new catalyst for China, Europe and Japan equities. Uh we can this has been a theme for us. We came into the year talking weak dollar. Everyone thought we were crazy. It continues to persist. Uh this is probably the most important data point of the week. And some of you are going to have a tough time understanding this one. Um uh and that's okay. Don't worry about it. I'll do my best to explain it. But what this chart is, it shows select growth and quality factors, percentage of respondents. This is the uh institutional manager survey. Percentage of respondents using return on equity edged higher in 2024. So what you can see is the quote unquote value investor of yestery year um has been forced into this new framework which basically means they've become closet indexers and they have justified it by calling it quality uh or growth at a reasonable price and uh it's masqueraded in the concept of return on equity or more commonly return on invested capital. Now return on equity and return on invested capital are critically important variables. Um however they tend to be um emphasized more so as it relates to what they call quality or durable secular growers which in effect has been mag seven. It's just a code. It's a fancy way of saying I'm not a closet indexer, but when you'll look at my book, I've been I've been basically bagged in the most crowded trades uh for a while. And if you look at the greatest value investors of all time, uh, that made billions in the 70s when the stock market did nothing from 1968 to 1972, whether it was Buffett or Cooperman or Gabelli, uh, kind of the value mafia I grew up with. Um, uh, no one is talking in those terms. No one is talking about the investing style of turnaround Tom that Buffett did when he was running his partnerships and shot the lights out before rolling his LPs into a permanent capital vehicle called Berkshire Hathaway. And uh what I'm the point that I'm making with this chart is that um and I was I was texting with a friend. I said so so these annotations are my own. The red being everyone now focused on quote unquote quality, return on equity. Uh whereas these periods in green are cyclicals value and turnaround turnaround Tom type of stuff. And um you can see the dramatic outperformance from 2001 to 2007. We've talked about that a lot. And then in the early 90s also in the 80s and then in a big way in the 70s. As a matter of fact, you know, we've we've talked about it. uh value has outperformed growth uh including this aberrational zerp period by 4% and change per year since 1927 including the last 10 years when we had zero interest rate policy which means if you had invested a million dollars in 1927 in value or growth uh you would have 68 million more dollars if you chose value. So what I told my friend is another way to look at it is follows. Quote, \"If I were looking in the rear view mirror, what would be the most important metric to be overweight?\" And what everyone was going to say is quality, uh, high return on equity, secular grower, aka code for mag 7, what worked yesterday. Uh, the church of what worked yesterday. Now much of the value quote unquote community is now singing from the same himnil because they've been forced to in order to survive. Most do don't do turnarounds well. They don't understand the the the framework and the formula that works. Um so they they and the and the value traps that they had been in uh certainly didn't work. So they've kind of moved into being growth investors without admitting it and just closet indexing. We are taking the exact opposite tact and believe those who have overweight exposure to the green cyclicals value turnarounds that are just starting to uh rock and roll following the once in aundredyear uh situation created by co uh will dramatically outperform the next 3 to 5 years. Even those who take the view that capital light has changed the game. So everyone that's now chasing what worked yesterday and focused on quality secular growers, high return on invested capital, high return on equity, which over time is a good formula to have except when everyone else is doing it. Um would be advised to at least hedge that view with solid green exposure in case the historical cycle proves to be recurrent. And I say in case to be gentle when the historic recurrent cycle proves to come back. Uh and it's already started to happen this year as you saw and and which has been a core to our theme. International would outperform US, dollar would get weaker. Now you're going to start to see smalls outperform large. Uh record short interest in small caps. Cyclical turnarounds. We're already seeing these home runs. Whether it's uh QXO, which is a cyclical, whether it's uh uh Comtock Resource is a cyclical, that's almost up uh eight times four, that's almost up four bags now. Um and on and on. So, the the game is just beginning here. So, you know, you might feel like you missed it when you look at indices because all you're looking at is this, which is due to take a continued breather. And we've talked about Max 7 trading back to the top of the range, but not more because their earnings growth is cut in half and their capex is going through the roof. Uh the fortunes are are going to continue to be made here uh for existing clients yearto date, you know what I'm talking about and so on. So, leaving that aside, even if you're of the view uh chasing what everyone else is doing and calling it something else, you'd be very wise if you're a large capital allocator to hedge that bet and have someone who's exceptionally skilled, which is a dying breed, by the way, in these areas right here. I would say in five years, you're going to see a huge crowd get very interested in this area, but by then all the money will be made by people like me. So, um, and you, so that's the name of the game. Uh, huge reversal in fund manager survey recession expectations in the last two months. Went from the tariffs to not the tariffs. So, this weekend, maybe Trump drops a a bunker bomb, maybe he doesn't. Market's a little jittery, but we'll get through that and we'll have an outcome by Monday for sure. Uh, FMS investors view corporate balance sheets as the best health since March of 2016. They've delevered. That's a good thing. Just like household balance sheets had. Oh, and by the way, uh here's my beautiful hedge fund tips with Tom Hayes mug. Price is what you pay. Value is what you get. Uh thanks for everyone sending in pictures. We got a new photo. Thanks just for sending it in, but the guy sent a picture of his cat. So, I don't know if that counts, but we did post them up with some of the other photos we've already gotten in. When you place an order, uh and I think the golf shirts are back in. Uh the t-shirts have been a big hit. obviously the hats and mugs, but um send your picture to we we have so many orders and so few pictures. So, stop being shy. If you want, just put a fake name or whatever and we'll we'll post you. But, uh we covered these last week. Uh a lot of hats and t-shirts. So this is our latest from Don G who is a cat reading the intelligent investor by Ben Graham and uh sitting next to his hedge fund tips hat. Best performing asset in the next 5 years fund manager survey says international stocks opinion follows trend. What a difference a half a year makes. Couldn't give away international when we were pounding the table. Now everyone wants it. It's just getting started ladies and gentlemen. uh asset quilt of total returns. Uh MSCI EA is up 18% year-to date. Emerging markets up 13.9%. Uh S&P up only 3%. REITs up 5%. Uh global high yield cash and commodities. So that's that. We've seen very few instances where gold is at the top of the range for more than two years. The last time that happened was uh 2010 to 2011. The next year it fell to third to the bottom. The following year after that it had the absolute worst performance. So for everyone chasing gold up here, God help you. Investors on EPS and leverage net percent of FMS investors think that global corporate profit growth will improve. That's coming off the lows, but it's at levels like you saw in COVID, like you saw in the tech wreck in 2022, and like you saw in the great financial crisis and the tech wreck of 20201. The sentiment is still subdued. Midcap ETFs accelerating in inflows. This is the theme. small and midcap starting to play just like you saw in 2001 to 2003 and then straight through outperformance to 2007. Lower financial leverage than 20 thou uh 1990s and 2000s. You can look at the balance sheet here. We haven't had this low leverage since the mid80s for corporate balance sheets. Global materials still dramatically underweight. That's where Albamaro in a quasi related sense, Comtock Resources, that's why you're starting to see huge moves there. Uh, household holdings as equity of equities as a percentage of total financial assets. This is US equities, ladies and gentlemen. And honestly, we haven't had this highest percentage since ' 68. Um, market kind of topped out in ' 68 and certainly started to collapse from 72 to 74. uh 2000 and 2024. Now you have to consider that top 10 stocks is still 40% of the S&P 500. So what this means is the overweight relative to everything else. Same thing in 2000 if you remember the magazine covers uh in 1999 saying has Warren Buffett lost his touch and Warren Buffett was buying Proctor and Gamble. he was buying all these defensive stocks, uh, staple stocks, boring stocks, industrial stocks at the top of the quote unquote market in 2000. And in 2001 and 2002, while the NASDAQ crashed 90, his stocks rocketed. So, you're thinking like, well, if the market crashes, um, would, you know, wouldn't everything crash? And the answer is no when you have such a concentrated period, if you are in the right things. And that's why you need to hedge out with especially if you're a large allocator with someone who is a specialist in the greens unless you think this is going to be the exception where this doesn't revert to the mean and those top 10 weights meaning 40% don't underperform for the next handful of years and our case is that they will and they have and you've seen it year to date even though they're bouncing back in the range. We had said that they will bounce back to the top of the range and in aggregate not overtake if you take a mags versus you know one stock someone will say well what about Microsoft or what about one of these that's making new highs yeah there will be one or two but you you know you look at uh Tesla is still down Google's still down even Amazon which is probably a buy um so so you want to f to make massive amounts of money in the next two to three years you need to find what's not in these percentages that are going going to be a uh at the effect of mean reversion. Bank of America global fund manager survey investor sentiment improves slightly from May uh via bearish April level. Again, you see these levels only at the 2022 lows, the COVID lows, uh the first trade war, the EU debt crisis, great financial crisis and 9/11. So, uh, for those who think that everyone's too bullish and therefore we're going to crash, uh, they're absolutely incorrect. I I think after we get through this Iran volatility, uh, we're going to push to new highs before the end of summer, probably before the end of July. Bubbles, uh, you can see past bubbles, ARC, and Bitcoin, which is an interesting one that Bank of America points out here. uh you had uh smaller China in the late uh uh 2010s or 2000s 2007 to 2009 that is going to recur in our view uh over the next two years. There will be a final blowoff for China just like you had the final blowoff for Japan in the late 80s and we're going to benefit from that with Baba. Growth has underperformed value by 7 percentage points so far this year. Uh that was also part of the theme. Value dispersion peaks usually precede value cycles. the cycles we talked about. What's the cycle is making sure you have a manager that's expert in these areas because the cycle value cycle is just beginning. Uh and if you know what you're doing, it's like it's literally like a treasure hunt every single day. Uh value trades well below historic average versus growth. You can see here this is plus or minus two standard deviations. We're probably about halfway there. And then valuation strategies for information technology. Uh price to free cash flow outperformed the index the most over the last uh 45 40 years. And that's buying low price to free cash flow is the name of the game right now. That's not popular. That will come back very very it's already coming back. This year has been the inflection point. Large caps relative performance total return of growth versus value. You can see here this extreme not seen since 2000. And then prior to that 1980 and we know what happened next. Value dramatically outperformed. S&P 500 increasingly topheavy. again top 10 largest S&P companies as a percentage of the S&P almost 40% 38% this will revert in 2000 it was 25% you'll have your people come out and say well this time it's different cap light blah blah blah I heard the same story about eyeballs in 1999 AI is certainly going to change the world just like the internet did the question is how much have you already\nShort interest has risen in 2025 that creates the next buyers which is why I&#39;m been pushing we&#39;re going to new highs before the end of summer. FMS investors are net 38% underweight US equities, the most since May of 2023. This has hockey stick since the beginning of the year. We called this on the podcast aggressively in the fourth quarter of last year. Go back and look at the tapes. More downside for dollar expected. Opinion follows trend. That&#39;s from Bloomberg. Economists raise China growth exports outlook for 2025. composition of the $81 trillion global equity market. You can see here US is 64%. The earnings power is nowhere near that percentage of the overall equity pie and that will revert and we&#39;ve seen the beginnings of that this year. Long emerging markets again one standard deviation below the means. Uh, and the last times you got to this was 20201, which was you never made more money in a shorter period of time than being long emerging markets, small caps in value from 2001 to 2007. Everything&#39;s pointing to the same thing. Very similar. Why did you see a lot of these managers make billions in the 70s when the stock market did nothing? Small caps outperformed. It was a stock picker paradise. Same thing&#39;s going to happen now. Um and by the way, same thing in the second um term of uh Reagan uh in the late 80s from 85 to 90 and early part of Bush one. Target rate probabilities for September 17th meeting up to 64% now. first cut. We covered that on Vney AI. Bulls minus bears. Again, not at extreme. We push higher, ladies and gentlemen. Uh 6 months later on average 10%, one year later, 21%. S&amp;P 500, you can see here, making an aggressive what they call a cup and handle. Measured move would imply 4900 to 6,000 is,00 measured move would imply 7,100 probably by sometime in 2026. Yet another sign this is a bull market. Uh after 2 months of gains in the S&amp;P of 20% or more 1950 to today, one year out on average up 30%, 6 months out on average 16%. Economists expect Germany to grow again this year. that is from negative earnings growth to positive earnings growth starting this year and reacelerating 2026 2027. That helps the European theme that helps our GXO position which we talked about with Stew. Uh by the way, I got some incredible news. I&#39;m going to just skip to it right now. uh literally it must have been either while I was talking to Vney uh or shortly thereafter GXO announces completion of the UK regulatory review of Winkitin acquisition and raises full year 2025 guidance. So this is what I said as one of the two catalyst for GXO to get to 60 before the end of the year and probably more by the way. uh largest pure play contract logistics provider announced that the UK competition markets CMA has cleared GXO&#39;s acquisition of Winkitin subject to the devestment of a small number of Wikington grocery contracts in the UK which is less than probably less than 3% of total revenues of Winkitin uh and that invest integration will be permitted with the vast majority of the Winkutin business once certain administrative conditions are met. The company also announced today that it is raising fullear guidance on organic revenue growth, adjusted IBIDA and adjusted diluted EPS. We are pleased with the regulatory review. Excited to bring the two businesses together combination offering uh customers across the UK, Ireland bring presence in strategic verticals that will serve as a springboard for growth. Well positioned to move forward swiftly and look forward to welcoming the Winkington team to GXO. updated fullear guidance organic revenue growth. Uh the midpoint was brought up to 5% from 4 a.5% organic revenue growth. IBIDA midpoint uh from 850 to 870. So 20 more million of adjusted IBIDA. EPS midpoint 253 from 250 and uh free cash flow conversion to 30% mid-range. So all of this super exciting news. Pretty timely for that interview this morning. Uh better to be lucky than to be good sometimes. So uh earnings of MCI China continue to uh shoot upward. compound annual growth rate over the next seven years expected to be uh let&#39;s see here what are we talking about somewhere around 9 10% US uh with the implication being the value intrinsic value of the businesses off of normalized value multiples would be double off of depressed multiples will probably be quadruple FYI so Um, Goldman holdings in Chinese equities as a percentage of total AUM is uh 1.6% the benchmark is 5% managers are 3.4% underweight Chinese equities. The catch-up is going to be violent violent to the upside if you don&#39;t have it. Uh, can&#39;t help you. An overlooked boom in China. 15 major economies with the highest growth rate of household spending in this century. Uh that game is back on. We&#39;re going to cover a couple of things about that. China&#39;s consumption gets a boost from tradein subsidies, household appliances and video equipment, furniture, communication appliance, automobiles, retail sales. This is called Alibaba is the toll taker. 40 cents of every retail dollar spent on e-commerce goes through Taoba T- Mall. Uh the government has committed to 70% internal consumption. uh and Baba is best positioned to take advantage of that. Particularly the middle class Timu and that garbage PDD got uh a share of the pie when people were poor during COVID and bought garbage. Now that the middle class is reemerging and getting their confidence back, Taoba Teeal controls the middle class spend and is the preeminent toll taker. International stock seen as the best asset class over the next five years. uh opinion follows trend. It&#39;s amazing when you have 15 percentage of outperformance. Goldman Sachs top down S&amp;P 500 forecast 12 months out 6500. So that&#39;s opinion follows trend. They went down when the market went down. Now they&#39;re back up. They blow like a you know in California now I understand blowing like like the wind like a palm tree in the wind. Uh that&#39;s most of the sell side earnings growth. And by the way, that&#39;s why they keep their jobs. If they were like an oak tree, uh and they and they fought the wind, they would snap. Uh these guys blow with the wind. So like a palm tree, they always bounce back and keep their jobs. uh earnings growth proform earnings uh year-over-year. You can see uh unmagnificent 493 accelerating mag 7 collapsing. That&#39;s not new. We&#39;ve covered that almost every week. China retail sales year reacelerating like we haven&#39;t seen since 2022 and prior to that uh 2020 when all the equities were off the charts. game is just beginning. Retail flows have recently been stronger than average and they&#39;ve been right. Okay, by the way, they were uh buying the dip in COVID uh international relative to the rest of the world stocks since 1950. So, you can see here this concentration that&#39;s going to get smacked already has this year. It&#39;s going to continue to get smacked when you have this concentration like you saw in 2019. And most people don&#39;t know that they&#39;re still stuck in this and they&#39;re all on one side of the boat about to get drowned um because they think they own 500 stocks and they don&#39;t understand what a cap weight it is index is relative to an equal weight uh relative to exposure to a manager that specializes in the green area which is looking through the windshield versus the rear view mirror. Median twoe S&amp;P 500 return since 1950. uh second half of June. Okay. Tends to be weak. We&#39;ll see what happens. GS social I I I think we pulled forward a lot of the weakness that was supposed to happen in June and got it in um April and May, but let&#39;s see. GS social media economic sentiment index starting to move back up. FMS most underweight the US dollar in 20 years. This goes all the way back to the early 2000s, which was when what happened? International outperformed, value outperformed, small caps outperformed. What do you know? Retail investors have been selling in the last three weeks. Uh, every single consistent. Okay. Well, it&#39;s something to keep an eye on. Household allocation to US equities across global regions. US has the most concentration, which means they&#39;re overweight. those seven stocks, which by the way, the carry trade continues to unwind. We&#39;ve warned you about that. And all that hot money is coming out of those seven stocks. Underweight China, that will play catchup. More opinion follows trend. Stock market around breath thrust, which we just had 12 months later on average up 15.5%. So basically, here we are. Here&#39;s where we have to go after this level of breath thrust for the technicians out there. Investor allocation to equities at an all-time high which basically means still mag seven because of the waitings even though the earnings growth is collapsing in those kind of call it 10 names central underweight debt which is going to change now the demand for treasuries is going up. Uh Bowen and Bessant are going to get the uh SLR intact probably in coming weeks. The Genius Act was passed yesterday that&#39;ll create another trillion dollars of demand to two trillion of demand of treasuries over the next two years. Uh the game is on and then uh Trump will probably start to appoint or announce uh trial balloon names of new Fed chair. So that will act as what we call a shadow Fed chair. So Powell has effectively made himself a lame duck uh for the remainder of his term once Trump starts to announce a you know very throw very dovish names out there. The market will start to discount 100 to 200 basis points of immediate cuts uh that will come into play May of 2026. It&#39;ll start to discount it uh the third or fourth quarter of this year. So be on the lookout for that. central bank cuts at fastest pace in 2025 last month. Everyone except for Powell. Too late Powell. Um and that&#39;s that. He&#39;ll he&#39;ll he&#39;ll get away with it. He&#39;ll set the table in in Jackson Hole. He&#39;ll do the first cut in September and probably second in December and then he will be off to play congressional five days a week. I hear he&#39;s a pretty good golfer by the way. Um S&amp;P price to sales over time. Again, this is skewed by those 10 names. Decade worth of volatility in the 2020s. Uh that&#39;s interesting. Wow. More volat almost double the volatility of the 70s. The stories I heard about the 70s. That&#39;s pretty wild. Consumer balance sheet very healthy. $190 trillion of assets, $20 trillion of liabilities. That&#39;s pretty damn healthy. Fed call as of 610 2025. There&#39;s a lot of room to lever up once they get the rates under control. Powell&#39;s just kind of delaying things, but it is what it is. Fed call as of 610. That&#39;s immaterial. Results for buying S&amp;P on the last day of loss exceeds 12%. No one cares. cumulative retail sales January through May. Total short interest ticking up. So, last time we saw short interest get this high was like the the whole in 2016 and you had a monster rally the next couple of years. Um, you know, these guys are forced buyers. this amount of short interest the whole way up from 2020 from 2022 higher. They just kept shorting and shorting shorting. So now they&#39;re going to be forced buyers as this thing pushes to new highs. Huge move into Euro zone and emerging markets out of US and US dollar. We&#39;ve been calling for that for a while. into the euro, into healthcare, by the way, into industrials, slowly out of tech, out of Japan, uh, out of the US dollar. Record high foreign ownership of the US stock market that&#39;s starting to decline, underweight energy, we see it in the comm stocks, Christmas in July, NASDAQ&#39;s 12-day midyear rally. So markets tend to have a massive rally in the first 12 trading days of July. You do not want to get short ahead of that. If you want to lighten up, do so after alltime highs sometime in August. But basically, it just grinds sideways till the end of year rally or net. Uh Russell 1000 versus Russell 2000. This is large cap versus small cap. This is going to mean revert like nobody&#39;s business. We have not been at this level of an extreme since 2001. Hold on to your seat belts. If you don&#39;t have small cap exposure, just, you know, look, all this is opinion, not advice, but at least get yourself uh an ETF if you don&#39;t have a manager who can pick the best stocks for you. Um, so click on terms here, opinion, not advice. Talk to your financial adviser be before doing anything. Speaking of which, we are going to be opening up again for Q3 uh for the smaller accounts, the $1 million and above. So, those of you who are interested in getting in queue for that and having a conversation so you can be ready to go Jy 1st, uh click on go to headphone tips, click on money management, uh and we&#39;ll have a chat. This is uh not a solicitation. All this is opinion, not advice. Do whatever you want. Check with your financial advisor first. Uh Bloomberg trade policy index S&amp;P year to date trade policy uncertainty. So that&#39;s that&#39;s getting more certain. Companies that reduce shares at low valuations tend to outperform annualized performance 1986 to 2025. Uh the per the the greatest example of this under the sun is what Alibaba did buying back stock between $60 and $80. I mean they couldn&#39;t have done any better. I&#39;d say another one that did a good job was 10 cent. It&#39;s amazing these Chinese companies, they were smart enough to have cash reserves and they were twice as smart to deploy them in the hole when everyone was ducked under the desk. And uh you know now these stocks are up 100% and not even starting to move yet. They&#39;re the the beginning of their moves is just now. Um but they did the exact right thing. You rarely see that with US managers. What you see with US managers unfortunately is after the stock has had you know a huge run 4x 5x they start buying back stocks so they can sell their ESOP plans into the liquidity created by the company which is you know a crime. It&#39;s it&#39;s not a literal crime. It&#39;s a figurative crime and it&#39;s ripping you off as as owners. But uh it is what it is. Companies that reduce shares at low. Okay. Valuation matters. It didn&#39;t it just didn&#39;t for the 2010s. Uh so if you go back IBIDA enterprise value dramatically outperform from 86 to 2006. We&#39;ve been through this and that&#39;s that on the data front. So, a lot of great stuff there. Some\n\nBank of America fund manager survey update. We put the summary out on Tuesday. 22 222 managers running 587 billion AUM. Here are the top five points. Opinion follows trend. 54% of managers now expect international stocks to be the best performing over the next 5 years. You couldn't give away an international stock in Q4 when we were pounding the table. Managers are now the most underweight. The US dollar uh they&#39;ve been since 20 years. What was the narrative last year? King dollar. Materials and energy remain unloved with managers net 26% underweight. energy up from last month&#39;s record low allocation and 15% underweight materials. Uh there&#39;s your com stock and Albamaro just getting started. Four of the doomsday recession expectations we saw in April have collapsed, reversing from 42% of managers saying global recession was likely to now a net 36% saying it is unlikely. Trapped bears continue to fuel the pain trade to the upside. And five managers are 28% net overweight emerging market equities. How you like that? 28% overweight emerging market equities, up from last month&#39;s net 11% and the highest allocation since August 2023. Here&#39;s Albamaro. Each week we try to cover one to two companies we&#39;ve discussed in previous podcast vidcast uh and or own for clients including personally. So you can see here free cash flows recovering but still lagging prices doing exactly what it should based on that. Our favorite theme heading into 2025 was the last shall be first with healthcare and materials as our top two sectors. Both had been left for dead after posting anemic returns in 2024, but earnings for the two were expected to recover handsomely in 2025. Healthcare was projected to grow by 20.7, materials by 18.9, both ranking among top four overall sectors. Six months into the year, healthcare has largely held up, now projected to deliver 14.5% earnings growth and rank third overall. Materials stumbled out of the gates partially on the tariffs. uh took it on the chin from tariffs with earnings growth now expected to be 7.8%. Uh but as they say, being too early is indistinguish from being wrong. Uh that&#39;s exactly how this one has played out so far with the materials recovery looking more like a 2026 story. Uh and if we zoom out, the delay in the recovery could end up being more like a blessing in disguise. That&#39;s because our number one pick for the theme is Albamaro, a position that at the time wasn&#39;t large enough yet because the price had run away from us. We don&#39;t buy up and we&#39;re hoping to get a second bite at the apple. Luckily, we&#39;ve gotten the opportunity served on a silver platter to size in accordingly. Albamaro is the world&#39;s largest and lowest cost lithium producer. The roller coaster story of lithium over the past 5 years goes something like this. Demand went through the roof in 2021 and through 2022 as the EV and renewables boom took off in full force. Automakers were scaling production and stockpile on lithium. All while supply was heavily constrained from years of underinvestment and logistical bottlenecks. This perfect storm sent prices up more than eight 8x, reaching all-time highs of north of 80,000 per metric ton. And Albamaro was minting more cash than they knew what to do with. But the high prices quickly brought a wave of new supply. Small-cale producers in China, many fully subsidized, flooded the market and created massive supply glut. Lithium prices came crashing down. uh and Albamaro&#39;s stock fell with them down more than 80% to where it is today. The good news for Albamaro is that as we mentioned they are the largest and lowest cost producer worldwide. This has allowed them to cut operating costs in capex and pretty much sit on their hands and wait for cycllically low lithium prices to recover. Meanwhile, the longer prices stay in the pain zone, the more lowquality marginal producers will get taken out on a stretcher. To put this into context, Albamaro Management estimates that 40% of global current lithium capacity is at or below break even only with onethird of that supply having come on coming off having come offline so far. This should continue to support Albamaro and lithium prices from the supply side with analysts expecting the supply glut to shrink and largely be gone by 2026. So with supply starting to dry up and marginal producers coming offline, this the focus now shifts to the other side of the equation, demand. And what becomes immediately clear is that demand has never been the issue for lithium. It has gone up and to the right with no signs of slowing with consensus still calling for 15 to 20% kagger over the next decade. Meanwhile, all the noise about slowing EV growth in North America still up 17% yearonear has created a catharsis among investors. That but that completely misses the point. The reality is that North America accounts for just 10% of global EV sales. The real story is China, which makes up more than 60% of the market. It&#39;s a government subsidized market, and the government will not stop when it has its mind set on something, and just posted a 41% growth in the first quarter. Meanwhile, while everyone stays focused on the EV narrative, they are missing what may be the biggest shift happening under the surface. Data centers and stationary storage. Just a few years ago, this segment was expected to make up around 5% of total lithium demand. Today, projections are closer to 30%. Few weeks ago, Ken Hoffman, shout out by the way to Brad\nKen Hoffman is an expert in lithium and battery materials, formerly at McKenzie, laid out the case for a lithium recovery. He sees the bottom in 2025 and a gradual recovery starting in 2026. prices reaching 15 to 20,000 per metric ton by year end. While the market obsesses over the temporary supply glut, Hoffman&#39;s thesis is built on something you won&#39;t hear anyone else, underappreciated demand. He projects global demand could reach 6 to 10 million metric tonses by 2035. We&#39;ve been talking about it going from 1.2 to 3.2. So, if this happens, this thing could be a five bagger. But let&#39;s just be realistic here. Um, or conservative again. Demand in 2024 was about 1.2 million and Alba Mar&#39;s high-end forecast for 2030 is 3.3. That&#39;s in line with our forecast. This guy&#39;s talking double or triple that. And we see a threebagger just on on the conservative estimates. If that scenario plays out, Albero isn&#39;t just a double, it&#39;s a multiagger. \n### FEATURED_COMPANY_DEEP_DIVES\nNow on to Albero earnings. Here&#39;s everything you need to know following the Q1 report. You can go through this step by step. Uh break even free cash flow in 2025. That&#39;s key in trough prices. is the fact that they can be break even. By the way, this is a dividend aristocrat. They&#39;ve raised a dividend every single year for over 30 years. Uh that&#39;s going to continue to happen. You can lock in a very uh low basis so that um as the dividend, you know, you&#39;ll lock in whatever it is 2 and a half or 3% whatever it is now. But even as the price goes up, the dividend yield on your basis is going to keep going up as they keep increasing the dividend. And then if you reinvest it, you can really compound money. Anyway, here are the 10 key points. Through April, management achieved 90% run rate against the midpoint of their 350 million cost and productivity savings program. More importantly, they&#39;ve identified additional opportunities to reach the high end of 300 to $400 million range with potential for even more upside. Adjusted Ebida margins in Q1 came in at 25% up 400 basis points year-on-year in a trough cycle. This is unbelievable. With SGNA costs down over 20% as the cost savings program continues to bear fruit. Three, in light of cycllically low prices, management continues to cut back on capex with full year 2025 expectations of 700 to 800 million, down more than 50% year-on-year. This comes down from an already low base in 2024. That was reduced by over 450 million compared to 2023&#39;s 2.1 billion of capex. The long-term midcycle capex target remains around 6% of revenues. cash from operations uh in Q1 totaled four $545 million including a 350 million customer prepayment resulting in an operating cash flow conversion of 204% excluding the prepaid pay payment conversion still came in at 73% above above the long-term average of 60 or 70% bringing fullear 2025 expectations to north of 80% five not only did management maintain their full year 2025 outlook they also reiterated their expectation of break even free cash flow for for the year after delivering slightly positive free cash flow in Q1 with positive free cash flow expected during 2026. Six, the direct impact of tariffs is expected to be minimal, totaling 30 to 40 million for the full year before any mitigations. This is largely due to Albamaro&#39;s global footprint with most lithium production sold directly to Asia and the critical mineral exemptions that are currently in place. Management has mitigations underway to significantly reduce the overall realized impact, including increased sales to lower tariff countries and optimizing supply chain. Seven management has estimated that 40% of the current global lithium capacity is at or below break even with only a third of that supply having come offline. Aka the number of the longer prices remain in the pain zone the more lowquality marginal producers will get taken out on a stretcher. Eight for the full year lithium demand is expected to grow between 15 to 40% with management currently forecasting growth around the mid 20% range. Long-term demand growth remains strong with lithium demand projected to more than 2x 2030 from 1.2 million metric tonses in 2024 and up to 3.3 million metric tonses growing at a near 20% kagger. Despite the headline noise, global EV demand continues to remain strong, up 34% yearonear. Strong sales in China continue to weigh lead the way up up 41% year-onear and remain over 60% of the total EV global EV market. Long-term demand expectations remained intact with EV market penetration expected to exceed IC by the end of the decade reaching about 54% global penetration and 10 stationary storage continues to be one of the main drivers for lithium. The market is expected to grow at 20 to 30% kagger through 2030. Uh growing from 190 to in 2024 to between 600 and 970 in 2030. Earnings call highlights you can go through at hedge funtips.com. And then um here&#39;s an article from Morning Star with a fair value. Lithium prices will rebound then remain well above the marginal cost of production through the at least the remainder of decade leading to excess profits and return on invested capital for Albamaro. Therefore, they have a $200 fair value on the stock down from 225. The stock is trading at about $60 right now. So, they&#39;re looking at a threebagger plus uh in a handful of years or less. I think it&#39;s going to be more and uh we&#39;re excited about it. So, that&#39;s that.",
    "MEDIA_APPEARANCE_RECAP": "\n\nThey&#39;ll they&#39;ll create a lot of demand for banks to hold treasuries once again. Uh, they can issue on the short short end and do an operation twist type of situation where they buy in the long end of the curve, bring down 10-year yields, bring down 30-year fixed rate mortgages. And by the way, I I I don&#39;t know if Powell will be will be successful, but I do think Bessant will be successful in bringing down the 10-year yield, which is going to bring mortgage rates below 6% before the end of the year, and that&#39;s going to be a good thing, as well as the stable coin demand for treasuries, the bill that was just passed yesterday, the Genius Act. \n### FEATURED_COMPANY_DEEP_DIVES\nOkay, you brought two stock picks with you. We got to get through them fast. Uh, first off, GXO Logistics. GXO. Yes. This is a Brad Jacobs company. The last Brad Jacobs company I came to your audience with two months ago was QXO. It&#39;s up 65% in the last two months. This one we believe is just taking off. It&#39;s a worldwide logistics company. Two catalysts. Number one, the CEO announced he was retiring several months back. So, we&#39;re going to get an announcement of a new CEO. That&#39;s going to be a positive catalyst. And number two, on June 25th, the CMA, the UK regulatory body, is going to rule on their Winkitin acquisition whether or not they need to divest the grocery business. The grocery business is only 6% of the revenues of Winkitin. So once that is completed, they can integrate, get the cost synergies, generate over 800 million of IBIDA this year. We think the stock&#39;s going from 42 to over 60 before the end of the year. Uh that&#39;s a good one. Okay. And the second one I got for you, you&#39;ve only got you got 20 seconds cuz we&#39;re almost out of time. Albamar, lithium miner. Albamar, go. Lowest cost, one of the largest lithium producers, very cyclical business. Prices are in a trough state. This happens every 5 to 8 years. The story here is  energy storage systems. The demand is going to go from 1.2 million metric tonses to 3.2 million metric tonses by 2030. Albamaro is best positioned even with trough prices. They&#39;re cash flow positive. Three billion dollars of liquidity. This can be a double to triple over the next three to four years.\n### MEDIA_APPEARANCE_RECAP\nAnd joining us now to discuss the latest Fed rate decision is Thomas Hayes. He&#39;s founder, chairman, and managing member of Great Hill Capital. Welcome back to the show, Thomas. Uh first off, I&#39;d like to get your reaction to the decision. Uh it was expected, but is the Fed getting it right? I don&#39;t think they are. I think Powell has unintentionally put him him himself in the position of being a lame duck for the remainder of his term. I think you&#39;re going to see President Trump start to allude to the next Fed chair which will create a shadow Fed situation which is going to be a dovish Fed moving forward. And I think President Trump made a couple important points today. Number one is Powell is about 200 basis points too restrictive. meaning the Fed funds rate is about 200 basis points more than inflation and that&#39;s going going to catch up and the the concept of too late Powell uh whether you love it or don&#39;t love it, President Trump has been right every single time and I think this this situation is going to be the case this time. That&#39;s the bad news. The good news is Powell was slightly more dovish. It originally looked as if the meeting was hawkish, but he did adjust language from the firming language to the adjustments language. And I would say one last thing, Diego, is that uh the Fed is supposed to be data dependent. And the whole meeting was about him predicting that inflation was going to go up because of tariffs, even though that simply was not the case in 2018. And I think pal uh President Trump has made the point in past appearances where he said, &quot;Listen, why don&#39;t you just cut and if you&#39;re right about inflation, you can always raise rates. He could always do a 25 or 50 point raise if inflation ticks up from tariffs.&quot; But if he&#39;s wrong, he&#39;s certainly going to be too late. And that is a risk to the economy. And uh and somewhat reflected in the projections, they&#39;re still projecting two cuts towards the end of the year. If they&#39;re so sure about that, why don&#39;t they just go ahead with it? Yeah, there was a lot of caution about the effect of tariffs uh during Powell&#39;s speech today and his uh and while he fielded uh journalist",

Yeah, there was a lot of caution about the effect of tariffs uh during Powell&#39;s speech today and his uh and while he fielded uh journalist\n### MISCELLANEOUS\nquestions , but GDP numbers have not been showing signs of tariffs impact so far. Uh we also got some better data uh about dropping, you know, sharply earlier this week. How how how trade uncertainty is shaping consumer spending right now? Yeah, look, we saw consumer confidence was okay. The GDP now numbers look strong. We will not have two consecutive quarters of negative GDP growth. So all of that is constructive. But at the same time, you have 72 millennials, million millennials, the largest segment of our population now, who have had to delay their lives because of Jerome Powell. They cannot afford houses because mortgage rates are too high. uh and uh and that&#39;s that&#39;s going to have knock-on effects for many generations to come if they don&#39;t move quickly. Uh again, the the the Fed is appointed to be data dependent. He is predicting and he continued to predict that inflation is going to go up and he may be right, but if he&#39;s right, he can adjust. It&#39;s much easier to bring down inflation through rate cuts than to ward off deflation if you get it wrong and you&#39;re too late because the cost of bringing the economy out of recession and the cost the societal cost of unemployment uh is far too great particularly when you have debt to GDP of 120%. and we&#39;re paying $600 billion more per year in interest than we need to be doing given the rate of inflation and given the rate of uh employment at the moment. Yes, Thomas. During his speech or during his speaking this afternoon, Powell spoke about when he addressed the the real estate market about first the rates and second about housing supply and new home construction here in the US fell in May to a 5-year low with economists saying the housing sector is struggling to add overall economic growth this year. How do I look at that? Because that&#39;s a longer term thing. This no this is the unintended consequence of wrongminded decisions by the Fed. Who&#39;s going to build a house when rates are 7 725 and risk capital and hope that it sells? I&#39;m telling you, if rates come down below 30-year fix comes below 6%, in other words, if the Fed funds rate was at a reasonable level, uh the demand for housing would be unlimited. And you couple that with the uh current administration looking to deregulate. They&#39;re going to open 500 something thousand acres of federal land. By the way, most of which in metropolitan areas where there&#39;s demand for starter home construction. The only thing that&#39;s missing right now, the only one that&#39;s delaying everything is our predictor and chief Jay Powell, who is predicting what he thinks might happen to inflation. If he&#39;s so certain about his predictions, why doesn&#39;t he look at his real GDP expectations, which he cut down to 1.4% real GDP for 2025 if he believes in his predictions so much that he thinks real GDP is going to be 1.4%. He should have done 50 basis points today. So, right now, it looks like he&#39;s getting away with it. Everything&#39;s good. GDP is okay. Earnings are okay. Employment looks okay. mixed data on that front, but once it starts to turn the other way, it turns hard. And he has the runway right now to take action. He didn&#39;t take advantage of today. My sense is maybe he&#39;ll get two more months to get get through it. He&#39;ll announce something at Jackson Hole or set the table for the next cut in September. And he&#39;ll probably squeak through and thread the needle. Okay. A few months too late, but he&#39;ll squeak through uh and it will be okay. But uh there would there would have been no downside of doing it today other than saving taxpayers three months of excessive interest on our treasury. We&#39;ll certainly speak again then. In the meantime, thank you Thomas Hayes. Great having you. Thank you Diego. Much more and we&#39;re back and then on to the uh\n\nquestions  each week who is new to the podcast because they're asking\n\n--- OVERLAP CONTINUED ---\n\nquestions  about the stocks that are in the\n\nheadlines  that week and the ones that have been around for one, two, three years. Uh number one, they're cool as a cucumber because by now they're they're wealthy relative to where they were. Uh and number two, they ask all the right questions\n\nmanagement has mitigations underway to significantly reduce the overall realized impact, including increased sales to lower tariff countries and optimizing supply chain. Seven management has estimated that 40% of the current global lithium capacity is at or below break even with only a third of that supply having come offline. Aka the number of the longer prices remain in the pain zone the more lowquality marginal producers will get taken out on a stretcher. Eight for the full year lithium demand is expected to grow between 15 to 40% with management currently forecasting growth around the mid 20% range. Long-term demand growth remains strong with lithium demand projected to more than 2x 2030 from 1.2 million metric tonses in 2024 and up to 3.3 million metric tonses growing at a near 20% kagger. Despite the headline noise, global EV demand continues to remain strong, up 34% yearonear. Strong sales in China continue to weigh lead the way up up 41% year-onear and remain over 60% of the total EV global EV market. Long-term demand expectations remained intact with EV market penetration expected to exceed IC by the end of the decade reaching about 54% global penetration and 10 stationary storage continues to be one of the main drivers for lithium. The market is expected to grow at 20 to 30% kagger through 2030. Uh growing from 190 to in 2024 to between 600 and 970 in 2030. Earnings call highlights you can go through at hedge funtips.com. And then um here&#39;s an article from Morning Star with a fair value. Lithium prices will rebound then remain well above the marginal cost of production through the at least the remainder of decade leading to excess profits and return on invested capital for Albamaro. Therefore, they have a $200 fair value on the stock down from 225. The stock is trading at about $60 right now. So, they&#39;re looking at a threebagger plus uh in a handful of years or less. I think it&#39;s going to be more and uh we&#39;re excited about it. So, that&#39;s that.\n### MISCELLANEOUS\nMoving along , earnings top 30 weights of financials last 60 days revised up uh 0.19% and 06% for 2025.

Big beautiful bill currently under consideration includes a roll off of solar tax credit. Okay, so he&#39;s asking about Nphase. I&#39;ve been asked about Nphase every week for the last two years. I&#39;ve continued to say no. It&#39;s continued to go lower. Um, you know, these stocks did do well under Trump 1.0. So, counterintuitively and energy stocks did not. and PH the problem is I think all their balance sheets are toast and if there&#39;s going to be no subsidies uh from the government I mean that that&#39;s the big thing that&#39;s why Elon got pissed is because the bill guts all the climate spend and um so they&#39;ve got some free cash flow how&#39;s this balance sheet 1.6 billion of cash, $1.2 billion of debt. Yeah, I mean the big problem with this is, you know, it was a 300 bagger off the lows. It is a broken growth stock. It&#39;s going to take an awfully long time to build a new set of shareholders. And looking at the financials, I think it looks okay, but I&#39;m not inclined to do anything with this at the moment, but I am inclined to start to do some work on it. So, I&#39;ll leave it there, but uh nothing really exciting about that.\n### ASK_ME_ANYTHING_QA\nYork Bourgeoa, uh hope your week has been going well. I had a question regarding your approach of enterprise value versus equity value. Wondering what you valued more, especially Thank that&#39;s not it&#39;s not even a framework way to think about it. You always have to consider enterprise value uh debt plus equity minus cash uh because that&#39;s total capital invested and you have to consider the total return on invested capital. Uh I do look at equity value. I tend to favor that a little bit more as an equity investor but I also analyze it on the basis of enterprise value because I want to I want to calculate total capital and the return on total capital. So, um I don&#39;t think it&#39;s relevant to getting the outcome that&#39;s going to give you alpha, but I do think you need to do both is the answer to your question. Kyler Johnson, uh I don&#39;t touch this one. Focus right ticker tune. Let&#39;s take a look at that. Uh, right. It&#39;s not a US stock, I guess. T N E. Yeah, it&#39;s British stock. All right, cool. [Music] Wow. Complete round trip. Let&#39;s see. [Music] Huh? I mean this is a tiny business. Uh what do they do for let&#39;s say 28 million? All right. What do they actually do development manufacturer market professional audio and electric music products? [Music] This is a niche tiny little small cap business. Um, yeah. I just don&#39;t know the business. I mean, you really have to understand what is their mo what&#39;s their competitive advantage. Is this the go-to? Like, no one really competes with them for these products. Are they that good? Why is growth slowown so much? What&#39;s the plan to reacelerate? Or does every guitar player already have one of these synthesizers? But I do like that the turnaround story looks interesting for sure. Um I just I would just have to have confidence in the product and understand the moat, which I don&#39;t think I&#39;m ever going to have a real edge on. Uh but if you do, you know, know what you own, I think you got something here. You just really have to go through all the public filings and the last maybe eight conference calls, see what management has said, see what they&#39;ve done, see what they&#39;re promising, how are they going to turn around, how are they going to reacelerate growth, and you might have something here. So, I think uh I think Kyler Johnson is on to something and finding a niche opportunity there that may turn out to be something good for him. So, good work. Uh let&#39;s move to the next one. Mark Callaway, thanks for all you do. I sing your praises to anyone who will listen and they all thank me for it later. Well, thank you for that. By the way, uh very grateful for your support and uh tuning in each week. If you&#39;re getting value, which I know so many of you are from the beautiful notes that you send in uh and testimonials which you can find on the website and on the YouTube uh every week on the videos. All I can ask is one, at the very least, go to YouTube and write a um uh comment and give your feedback. That helps push it up. The more people that view this, the longer we&#39;re going to do it for non-clients. Um uh you know, like, subscribe to the channel. Just go to YouTube, type in the search bar hedge fun tips.

And then the best compliment you could pay me uh if you&#39;re not a client or not able to do business with us uh is to share it with one person you like and loves and you know loves markets and would really benefit from this framework and help them make a lot of money. So um grateful for you doing that and um I invite the rest of you uh if you want to give back that&#39;s that&#39;s one great way to do it. Uh so his question is do you think Coinbase entering the payment market for e-commerce and Robin Hood rumored to do so in the fall will affect PayPal? Uh I PayPal has such a mode at this point that the amount of stock they&#39;re going to buy in 20% of the company. Uh they are the sixth largest stable coin. I&#39;m watching that part of the business. They have margin recovery. Alex Chris what he created at into it running 50% of the revenues. Multi multi multibagger. Uh, I&#39;d bet on Alex Chris way before I bet on either of these two CEOs. As much as the success that they&#39;ve had, Coinbase, I think, is going to get commoditized at some point. Uh, brokerages, uh, uh, everyone&#39;s super excited about Robin Hood, uh, and it&#39;s had a good run, and Vlad seems to be a good CEO, but all of that gets gets mar the margins just get eroded. The brokerage business has never been a durable competitive moat that doesn&#39;t get competed away over time. Robin Hood and Coinbase will be no different. Uh so yeah, I I continue to like PayPal over those. Sagar Kaya curious your preference about Intel over AMD. Uh very simple. How many fabs does AMD have in Arizona or Ohio? And that&#39;s all you need to know is that the government, whether they like Intel or hate Intel, needs Intel. And we need to produce chips in the US. Yes, Taiwan Semiconductor uh has fabs, but they&#39;re going to need unlimited numbers. And in Intel has the 5-year runway. This will be one of the greatest hockey stick stories from most hated to most loved in the shortest period of time. When it turns, it&#39;s going to turn all at once. uh AMD there&#39;s too much downside. I understand what the upside is, but the downside is material and there&#39;s nothing to back them up because there&#39;s nothing they have that their customers can&#39;t find another solution elsewhere. Whereas Intel, once their fabs are rolling, they&#39;re going to have a US duopoly with TSMC. So that&#39;s that. But you you&#39;ll notice that a number of these\n\n### ASK_ME_ANYTHING_QA\nthink Coinbase entering the payment market for e-commerce and Robin Hood rumored to do so in the fall will affect PayPal?

I&#39;m not sold on the CEO. she&#39;s kind of been fussing around FUTZ uh for too long. So, I would like to see a replacement of the CEO if that hasn&#39;t already happened. But yeah, this is a long-term compounder with a moat. Um that&#39;s just been a little bit mismanaged of late. So, free cash flow. I mean, look, the revenues haven&#39;t begun to recover. Margins are recovering. Uh, I I I think I think this one is probably fine here. If you could get it at a 100 bucks or 110 bucks, that would be even better. But I think for the long term, this one&#39;s generally going to be okay. And I like the thing. It&#39;s one that keeps popping up that I&#39;m not doing anything with because it&#39;s not an easy double in a reasonable amount of time, but um I think you&#39;ll get nice returns and um pretty handsome dividend while you wait if I&#39;m not mistaken. Let me just see here. four 4% dividend yield while you wait. My guess, let&#39;s see what they&#39;ve been doing with the dividend.\nSimon Stazzy, Icon Enterprises, no thank you. Where there&#39;s smoke, there might be fire. absolute legend, but there was too much intercomp financial chicainery going. I&#39;m not interested, even though I love what he&#39;s done over the years. I love his framework. Uh, that one makes me a little nervous. Uh, stumbled upon Zeta Global. Let&#39;s take a look. Lucas. [Music] Well, All right. So, first thing I want to figure out is why the margins have come down so much. Let&#39;s take a look at uh let&#39;s take a look at All right. So, the revenues are growing like a weed. I mean what the share count&#39;s gone from 31 million to 186 million. So congratulations they so okay so revenues have grown 3x the share count has grown uh 6x. So the share counts grown twice the pace of the revenue and the business. What&#39;s cash flow done? Forex balance sheet&#39;s probably clean. Yeah, I just I do not like that kind of growth in in the share count [Music] marketing automation. Yeah. Uh, no. I I just don&#39;t think I mean I have no confidence in knowing they&#39;re not going to take the share count to 700 million. So I Yeah, I I don&#39;t I don&#39;t like these type of managements. So not for me. Uh John H loving the podcast. Pittney Bose. No, no. There&#39;s a lot of people promoting Pney Bows and the story&#39;s changed and it looks better, blah, blah, blah. It&#39;s not for me. [Music] And it&#39;s already moved anyway, so you&#39;re kind of late. Let&#39;s take a look at the story here. We We&#39;ve done this one before. I I I don&#39;t like it. I know the business has changed. I know they&#39;ve got all this story about how it&#39;s going to be better. They have this every five years, and every five years it&#39;s the exact same result. pops up, insiders sell stock, reverts back. Not for me. Uh, Eric C, love listening to your podcast. Do you think Merc is doing more? Fears of the two products having competition. Generic&#39;s not doing well. Ah, I Yeah, I I keep looking at Mkin doing nothing, but I think it&#39;s probably ready. it. Yeah, it just hasn&#39;t come in enough for me to get super interested, but it&#39;s on my watch list. I&#39; I&#39;d be a pass here. I&#39; I needed to come down more before I&#39;d get interested, and it may not do. So, Tommo of the podcast. Uh, what small caps? We We Jack, we&#39;ve already covered like Comtock, we&#39;ve covered uh Cooper Standard, we&#39;ve I mean, we have a lot of small caps. Um, we own Canada Goose is a tiny position. So, all the small caps we&#39;ve covered. Otherwise, just buy an emer uh small cap uh ETF. Opinion not advice, but you got to get exposure to small caps and just don&#39;t think about it for the next three to five years. Matt Dell Priori, uh, I covered this somewhat recently, but have you thought about Nike? Yes, I&#39;ve thought about it and I have VF Corp is a better uh, riskreward. I mean, Nike is probably going to take longer than everyone thinks. Uh, Nike could be a double or triple. I think it&#39;s going to take five years. I think VF Corp can be a multibagger in three or less. So, for that reason, I I think Nike is good here. I We&#39;re just We&#39;re just not going to own it at the moment. We higher and better use. Raph Goldburn safe store in the UK. Um, s a fe.l. All right. Cut in half. Free cash flow peaked three years ago along pretty much along with revenues. Return on capitals continued to erode. Margins have continued to erode. What do they do? They are self storage group 209 stores. Yeah, I I have no edge on this because I don&#39;t know what the supply demand situation is on that. Um, you&#39;d really have to study the industry to to have an informed opinion on that. Uh, let me just see something here. Again, this is a broken growth stock, but it may be it may be close. Let&#39;s just take a look. I&#39;m sure there&#39;s Yeah, I mean, there&#39;s a billion dollars of debt. It&#39;s supported by the assets, but you&#39;re cutting it. What&#39;s happening with the free cash flow? Yeah, it&#39;s pretty steady. I I don&#39;t really have an edge on that business in Europe, so for that reason, I&#39;d probably pass. But it might be worth you doing more work if if uh you think there&#39;s an opportunity there. Let&#39;s just see here. Yeah, just just you might have something. It&#39;s not something that I would look at, but I appreciate you sending it in. Joshua Kaplan Sprouts Farmers Market SFM. This has always been a bad business, but let&#39;s see what it looks like now. [Music] Looks like it&#39;s recovering. SFM. Wow. Wow. Wow. Wow. Wow. Wow. This is absolutely I mean the [Music] What I can tell you is supermarkets are never a good business. So you have a run here, you&#39;re expanding, everything looks good. Eventually, you&#39;re going to hit a brick wall and you&#39;re going to crash just like you see in the Tik Tok memes where the where the 18-wheeler, you know, tests like a Land Rover test a Tesla and they all smash into the wall like an accordion. That&#39;s what happens when you own uh grocery store stock. So, I would I would just uh avoid it like the plague. It&#39;s almost as bad as airlines, except airlines you can buy cyclical troughs if their balance sheets are okay and play make a quick double or triple. But uh uh supermarkets are just bad news. So I I wouldn&#39;t touch it. James Deers, unless you think that you&#39;re going to get a lot of inflation, uh and their inventory value goes up, but that&#39;s that&#39;s a sucker game. I wouldn&#39;t play it. Uh Tom, appreciate your wise uh council opinion. Thanks for all you do. Uh wondering if you&#39;d have time to talk to Jeff Edwards about the China tease that he gave on the previous interview. Yeah, look, everything he needed to say was on there. The business is great. Be patient. Stop looking at price on a day basis. You&#39;ll be fine. Um, and by the way, you&#39;re already up four 4x, so chillax. Um, sorry it&#39;s not 10x in two minutes, but thank you for the question. Um, UD Audit, thanks for all the great insights for your podcast. You&#39;re just amazing. Thank you very much, Odd. That&#39;s very nice. Um, safe doubles, triples. Yeah, Dagio and Crown Castle. Absolutely fine. Uh, Terry S and we own both of them. Thank you for your content and hosting the podcast. Love it. Question. How can I learn to analyze and see markets like you do? Uh, 20 years in the business. Uh, listen to the podcast every week. Get your CFA I think is key. if you&#39;re young. Um, Warren Buffett&#39;s annual letters, must readad books is intelligent investor by Ben Graham for starters. And we&#39;ve covered like lists of like 10 or 20 books in the past. But that&#39;s the starting point and then go from there. Enjoy the journey. You&#39;ll find out after reading the intelligent investor whether this is what you should do with your life. Uh, if you&#39;re just joining because you think it&#39;s going to be a great way to only a great way to make money, I would go into another business, be an entrepreneur. If you&#39;re joining because it&#39;s what you want to do 247, um then you might have a chance after 10 or 20 years to get an edge and find your own unique style that um that can deliver value for your clients. Uh John Martin, Omegalex, gas piping in residential construction. O F L X. This business is low quality. OF LX and very very small. [Music] margins are holding up. Let me just see here. Pretty good balance sheet. I mean, the revenues haven&#39;t gone anywhere in six years. They&#39;re actually down. So, I just don&#39;t know what the growth story is from a stock perspective. Um, share counts been pretty steady. I mean, this is the kind of business that 20 million of free cash flow, [Music] 4% dividend yield. They don&#39;t expect growth either, paying out that kind of dividend. So you&#39;re paying enterprise value is 282 million for 20 million of free cash flow for a flat flattish business that shows no signs of growth. Uh yeah, it has definitely operating leverage relative to housing recovery, but I want to start to understand the turnaround story from management before I even look at it. I I think I mean this could easily go to 10 before it starts to recover. So management better start to show some signs of recovery because if it&#39;s if it&#39;s going to continue to have flat to negative revenue and financials, uh there&#39;s no telling how low it can go. It it had its run. It&#39;s a broken stock. You know, here we are five years later. It fits with the theme, but it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s too small of a business that it&#39;s there&#39;s no there&#39;s no moat. It&#39;s not like it was huge and it got hit, but everyone still needs their products. This is like a hundred million dollar business. It&#39;s like if if it ceased to exist tomorrow, it wouldn&#39;t affect anyone. If like Cooper Standard ceased to exist, it would hurt a lot of OEMs. It would like delay their lines, all the value ad that they&#39;ve done. So, I don&#39;t see why this business needs to exist, but at some price, it makes sense. I just don&#39;t know if this is the price yet. And you&#39;d have to listen to four to eight conference calls and really understand why and how they believe they can turn this around and it better be uh unassalable.\nEmil Bamante, any plans to get some exposure to rapidly growing commercial space industry? Already have it through Boeing? Uh Dave Burgerer, thoughts on Boston Beer Company, Hard Pass? Uh, Mark Dory 212 Retail UK brokerage. Uh, I I don&#39;t like the brokerage business at all. Even as excited as everyone is about Robin Hood and crypto and all that stuff, it&#39;s not what I say. Uh, you didn&#39;t send me a ticker, so I&#39;m going to pass on this one. I I just don&#39;t like the brokerage business generally. Cork Snyder uh talked about Ray Dallio a bit. Why his countries go broke? He&#39;s sees America blah blah blah. Uh we&#39;re in the 2030s we begin to have issues due to population issues. Yeah. Look, Cork, uh here&#39;s what I can tell you. When the music is playing, get up and dance. I think the music is going to be playing at least to 2030 and beyond. Uh and uh if Dalio&#39;s pessimistic about the 2030s, I tend to agree, but by then we&#39;ll have made so much money and cashed out uh and be sitting in cash and defensive in the early 2030s when the population falls off in the US that uh we&#39;ll be buying bargains like it&#39;s going out of style from probably 2034 to 2040 uh and God willing and um and make an absolute killing on on uh beyond that. But but for now, like that&#39;s so far off. I don&#39;t you know, Dalio predicting the 2030s are going to be bad. I I I tend to agree with him, but what precedes that is a booming 2020s and that&#39;s at least five to seven years more of non-stop money-m. Uh ride the bull while you got it. and uh and there&#39;s no all the factors are lined up for things to be super amazingly strong till the early 2030s and then after that then Dalio might be right and and we might have a problem but uh we&#39;ll deal with that then I wouldn&#39;t worry about it now unless you&#39;re trying to sell a book. So uh Jimmy Jones Windtock wish your family blessings. Thank you. Wish your family blessings. Win stock. I think you&#39;re okay here. But this is just like this. This thing just trades in a range back and forth. You&#39;re probably at the low end of the range. It&#39;s a good business. Best in class, but you&#39;re not going to make a ton of money on this. Yeah, go for it. It&#39;s okay. It&#39;s a trade. It&#39;s not one that I want to hold for a while, and I don&#39;t think you&#39;re going to get a double off it.

    "MACRO_DATA_SLIDES": "\n\n### MACRO_DATA_SLIDES\nlong only funds cyclical versus defensive positioning is very low versus history. So when we think about cyclicals think consumer discretionary like the the VF corpse etc. Energy tech industrials like the Generax like the Stanley Black & Deckers materials like the Albamaro tech like the Intels. We're going to talk about some developments there. Hedge funds are underweight cyclicals relative to defensives. always want to take the other side of the trade where the boat is crowded. Relative positioning at historic lows, which means we're going to see rip your face off moves uh in these baskets, which we have great exposure to. US dollar early stage secular bare market deterioration of the US government balance sheet, Fed policy, credibility and independence, new catalyst for China, Europe and Japan equities. Uh we can this has been a theme for us. We came into the year talking weak dollar. Everyone thought we were crazy. It continues to persist. Uh this is probably the most important data point of the week. And some of you are going to have a tough time understanding this one. Um uh and that's okay. Don't worry about it. I'll do my best to explain it. But what this chart is, it shows select growth and quality factors, percentage of respondents. This is the uh institutional manager survey. Percentage of respondents using return on equity edged higher in 2024. So what you can see is the quote unquote value investor of yestery year um has been forced into this new framework which basically means they've become closet indexers and they have justified it by calling it quality uh or growth at a reasonable price and uh it's masqueraded in the concept of return on equity or more commonly return on invested capital. Now return on equity and return on invested capital are critically important variables. Um however they tend to be um emphasized more so as it relates to what they call quality or durable secular growers which in effect has been mag seven. It's just a code. It's a fancy way of saying I'm not a closet indexer, but when you'll look at my book, I've been I've been basically bagged in the most crowded trades uh for a while. And if you look at the greatest value investors of all time, uh, that made billions in the 70s when the stock market did nothing from 1968 to 1972, whether it was Buffett or Cooperman or Gabelli, uh, kind of the value mafia I grew up with. Um, uh, no one is talking in those terms. No one is talking about the investing style of turnaround Tom that Buffett did when he was running his partnerships and shot the lights out before rolling his LPs into a permanent capital vehicle called Berkshire Hathaway. And uh what I'm the point that I'm making with this chart is that um and I was I was texting with a friend. I said so so these annotations are my own. The red being everyone now focused on quote unquote quality, return on equity. Uh whereas these periods in green are cyclicals value and turnaround turnaround Tom type of stuff. And um you can see the dramatic outperformance from 2001 to 2007. We've talked about that a lot. And then in the early 90s also in the 80s and then in a big way in the 70s. As a matter of fact, you know, we've we've talked about it. uh value has outperformed growth uh including this aberrational zerp period by 4% and change per year since 1927 including the last 10 years when we had zero interest rate policy which means if you had invested a million dollars in 1927 in value or growth uh you would have 68 million more dollars if you chose value. So what I told my friend is another way to look at it is follows. Quote, \"If I were looking in the rear view mirror, what would be the most important metric to be overweight?\" And what everyone was going to say is quality, uh, high return on equity, secular grower, aka code for mag 7, what worked yesterday. Uh, the church of what worked yesterday. Now much of the value quote unquote community is now singing from the same himnil because they've been forced to in order to survive. Most do don't do turnarounds well. They don't understand the the the framework and the formula that works. Um so they they and the and the value traps that they had been in uh certainly didn't work. So they've kind of moved into being growth investors without admitting it and just closet indexing. We are taking the exact opposite tact and believe those who have overweight exposure to the green cyclicals value turnarounds that are just starting to uh rock and roll following the once in aundredyear uh situation created by co uh will dramatically outperform the next 3 to 5 years. Even those who take the view that capital light has changed the game. So everyone that's now chasing what worked yesterday and focused on quality secular growers, high return on invested capital, high return on equity, which over time is a good formula to have except when everyone else is doing it. Um would be advised to at least hedge that view with solid green exposure in case the historical cycle proves to be recurrent. And I say in case to be gentle when the historic recurrent cycle proves to come back. Uh and it's already started to happen this year as you saw and and which has been a core to our theme. International would outperform US, dollar would get weaker. Now you're going to start to see smalls outperform large. Uh record short interest in small caps. Cyclical turnarounds. We're already seeing these home runs. Whether it's uh QXO, which is a cyclical, whether it's uh uh Comtock Resource is a cyclical, that's almost up uh eight times four, that's almost up four bags now. Um and on and on. So, the the game is just beginning here. So, you know, you might feel like you missed it when you look at indices because all you're looking at is this, which is due to take a continued breather. And we've talked about Max 7 trading back to the top of the range, but not more because their earnings growth is cut in half and their capex is going through the roof. Uh the fortunes are are going to continue to be made here uh for existing clients yearto date, you know what I'm talking about and so on. So, leaving that aside, even if you're of the view uh chasing what everyone else is doing and calling it something else, you'd be very wise if you're a large capital allocator to hedge that bet and have someone who's exceptionally skilled, which is a dying breed, by the way, in these areas right here. I would say in five years, you're going to see a huge crowd get very interested in this area, but by then all the money will be made by people like me. So, um, and you, so that's the name of the game. Uh, huge reversal in fund manager survey recession expectations in the last two months. Went from the tariffs to not the tariffs. So, this weekend, maybe Trump drops a a bunker bomb, maybe he doesn't. Market's a little jittery, but we'll get through that and we'll have an outcome by Monday for sure. Uh, FMS investors view corporate balance sheets as the best health since March of 2016. They've delevered. That's a good thing. Just like household balance sheets had. Oh, and by the way, uh here's my beautiful hedge fund tips with Tom Hayes mug. Price is what you pay. Value is what you get. Uh thanks for everyone sending in pictures. We got a new photo. Thanks just for sending it in, but the guy sent a picture of his cat. So, I don't know if that counts, but we did post them up with some of the other photos we've already gotten in. When you place an order, uh and I think the golf shirts are back in. Uh the t-shirts have been a big hit. obviously the hats and mugs, but um send your picture to we we have so many orders and so few pictures. So, stop being shy. If you want, just put a fake name or whatever and we'll we'll post you. But, uh we covered these last week. Uh a lot of hats and t-shirts. So this is our latest from Don G who is a cat reading the intelligent investor by Ben Graham and uh sitting next to his hedge fund tips hat. Best performing asset in the next 5 years fund manager survey says international stocks opinion follows trend. What a difference a half a year makes. Couldn't give away international when we were pounding the table. Now everyone wants it. It's just getting started ladies and gentlemen. uh asset quilt of total returns. Uh MSCI EA is up 18% year-to date. Emerging markets up 13.9%. Uh S&P up only 3%. REITs up 5%. Uh global high yield cash and commodities. So that's that. We've seen very few instances where gold is at the top of the range for more than two years. The last time that happened was uh 2010 to 2011. The next year it fell to third to the bottom. The following year after that it had the absolute worst performance. So for everyone chasing gold up here, God help you. Investors on EPS and leverage net percent of FMS investors think that global corporate profit growth will improve. That's coming off the lows, but it's at levels like you saw in COVID, like you saw in the tech wreck in 2022, and like you saw in the great financial crisis and the tech wreck of 20201. The sentiment is still subdued. Midcap ETFs accelerating in inflows. This is the theme. small and midcap starting to play just like you saw in 2001 to 2003 and then straight through outperformance to 2007. Lower financial leverage than 20 thou uh 1990s and 2000s. You can look at the balance sheet here. We haven't had this low leverage since the mid80s for corporate balance sheets. Global materials still dramatically underweight. That's where Albamaro in a quasi related sense, Comtock Resources, that's why you're starting to see huge moves there. Uh, household holdings as equity of equities as a percentage of total financial assets. This is US equities, ladies and gentlemen. And honestly, we haven't had this highest percentage since ' 68. Um, market kind of topped out in ' 68 and certainly started to collapse from 72 to 74. uh 2000 and 2024. Now you have to consider that top 10 stocks is still 40% of the S&P 500. So what this means is the overweight relative to everything else. Same thing in 2000 if you remember the magazine covers uh in 1999 saying has Warren Buffett lost his touch and Warren Buffett was buying Proctor and Gamble. he was buying all these defensive stocks, uh, staple stocks, boring stocks, industrial stocks at the top of the quote unquote market in 2000. And in 2001 and 2002, while the NASDAQ crashed 90, his stocks rocketed. So, you're thinking like, well, if the market crashes, um, would, you know, wouldn't everything crash? And the answer is no when you have such a concentrated period, if you are in the right things. And that's why you need to hedge out with especially if you're a large allocator with someone who is a specialist in the greens unless you think this is going to be the exception where this doesn't revert to the mean and those top 10 weights meaning 40% don't underperform for the next handful of years and our case is that they will and they have and you've seen it year to date even though they're bouncing back in the range. We had said that they will bounce back to the top of the range and in aggregate not overtake if you take a mags versus you know one stock someone will say well what about Microsoft or what about one of these that's making new highs yeah there will be one or two but you you know you look at uh Tesla is still down Google's still down even Amazon which is probably a buy um so so you want to f to make massive amounts of money in the next two to three years you need to find what's not in these percentages that are going going to be a uh at the effect of mean reversion. Bank of America global fund manager survey investor sentiment improves slightly from May uh via bearish April level. Again, you see these levels only at the 2022 lows, the COVID lows, uh the first trade war, the EU debt crisis, great financial crisis and 9/11. So, uh, for those who think that everyone's too bullish and therefore we're going to crash, uh, they're absolutely incorrect. I I think after we get through this Iran volatility, uh, we're going to push to new highs before the end of summer, probably before the end of July. Bubbles, uh, you can see past bubbles, ARC, and Bitcoin, which is an interesting one that Bank of America points out here. uh you had uh smaller China in the late uh uh 2010s or 2000s 2007 to 2009 that is going to recur in our view uh over the next two years. There will be a final blowoff for China just like you had the final blowoff for Japan in the late 80s and we're going to benefit from that with Baba. Growth has underperformed value by 7 percentage points so far this year. Uh that was also part of the theme. Value dispersion peaks usually precede value cycles. the cycles we talked about. What's the cycle is making sure you have a manager that's expert in these areas because the cycle value cycle is just beginning. Uh and if you know what you're doing, it's like it's literally like a treasure hunt every single day. Uh value trades well below historic average versus growth. You can see here this is plus or minus two standard deviations. We're probably about halfway there. And then valuation strategies for information technology. Uh price to free cash flow outperformed the index the most over the last uh 45 40 years. And that's buying low price to free cash flow is the name of the game right now. That's not popular. That will come back very very it's already coming back. This year has been the inflection point. Large caps relative performance total return of growth versus value. You can see here this extreme not seen since 2000. And then prior to that 1980 and we know what happened next. Value dramatically outperformed. S&P 500 increasingly topheavy. again top 10 largest S&P companies as a percentage of the S&P almost 40% 38% this will revert in 2000 it was 25% you'll have your people come out and say well this time it's different cap light blah blah blah I heard the same story about eyeballs in 1999 AI is certainly going to change the world just like the internet did the question is how much have you already\nShort interest has risen in 2025 that creates the next buyers which is why I&#39;m been pushing we&#39;re going to new highs before the end of summer. FMS investors are net 38% underweight US equities, the most since May of 2023. This has hockey stick since the beginning of the year. We called this on the podcast aggressively in the fourth quarter of last year. Go back and look at the tapes. More downside for dollar expected. Opinion follows trend. That&#39;s from Bloomberg. Economists raise China growth exports outlook for 2025. composition of the $81 trillion global equity market. You can see here US is 64%. The earnings power is nowhere near that percentage of the overall equity pie and that will revert and we&#39;ve seen the beginnings of that this year. Long emerging markets again one standard deviation below the means. Uh, and the last times you got to this was 20201, which was you never made more money in a shorter period of time than being long emerging markets, small caps in value from 2001 to 2007. Everything&#39;s pointing to the same thing. Very similar. Why did you see a lot of these managers make billions in the 70s when the stock market did nothing? Small caps outperformed. It was a stock picker paradise. Same thing&#39;s going to happen now. Um and by the way, same thing in the second um term of uh Reagan uh in the late 80s from 85 to 90 and early part of Bush one. Target rate probabilities for September 17th meeting up to 64% now. first cut. We covered that on Vney AI. Bulls minus bears. Again, not at extreme. We push higher, ladies and gentlemen. Uh 6 months later on average 10%, one year later, 21%. S&amp;P 500, you can see here, making an aggressive what they call a cup and handle. Measured move would imply 4900 to 6,000 is,00 measured move would imply 7,100 probably by sometime in 2026. Yet another sign this is a bull market. Uh after 2 months of gains in the S&amp;P of 20% or more 1950 to today, one year out on average up 30%, 6 months out on average 16%. Economists expect Germany to grow again this year. that is from negative earnings growth to positive earnings growth starting this year and reacelerating 2026 2027. That helps the European theme that helps our GXO position which we talked about with Stew. Uh by the way, I got some incredible news. I&#39;m going to just skip to it right now. uh literally it must have been either while I was talking to Vney uh or shortly thereafter GXO announces completion of the UK regulatory review of Winkitin acquisition and raises full year 2025 guidance. So this is what I said as one of the two catalyst for GXO to get to 60 before the end of the year and probably more by the way. uh largest pure play contract logistics provider announced that the UK competition markets CMA has cleared GXO&#39;s acquisition of Winkitin subject to the devestment of a small number of Wikington grocery contracts in the UK which is less than probably less than 3% of total revenues of Winkitin uh and that invest integration will be permitted with the vast majority of the Winkutin business once certain administrative conditions are met. The company also announced today that it is raising fullear guidance on organic revenue growth, adjusted IBIDA and adjusted diluted EPS. We are pleased with the regulatory review. Excited to bring the two businesses together combination offering uh customers across the UK, Ireland bring presence in strategic verticals that will serve as a springboard for growth. Well positioned to move forward swiftly and look forward to welcoming the Winkington team to GXO. updated fullear guidance organic revenue growth. Uh the midpoint was brought up to 5% from 4 a.5% organic revenue growth. IBIDA midpoint uh from 850 to 870. So 20 more million of adjusted IBIDA. EPS midpoint 253 from 250 and uh free cash flow conversion to 30% mid-range. So all of this super exciting news. Pretty timely for that interview this morning. Uh better to be lucky than to be good sometimes. So uh earnings of MCI China continue to uh shoot upward. compound annual growth rate over the next seven years expected to be uh let&#39;s see here what are we talking about somewhere around 9 10% US uh with the implication being the value intrinsic value of the businesses off of normalized value multiples would be double off of depressed multiples will probably be quadruple FYI so Um, Goldman holdings in Chinese equities as a percentage of total AUM is uh 1.6% the benchmark is 5% managers are 3.4% underweight Chinese equities. The catch-up is going to be violent violent to the upside if you don&#39;t have it. Uh, can&#39;t help you. An overlooked boom in China. 15 major economies with the highest growth rate of household spending in this century. Uh that game is back on. We&#39;re going to cover a couple of things about that. China&#39;s consumption gets a boost from tradein subsidies, household appliances and video equipment, furniture, communication appliance, automobiles, retail sales. This is called Alibaba is the toll taker. 40 cents of every retail dollar spent on e-commerce goes through Taoba T- Mall. Uh the government has committed to 70% internal consumption. uh and Baba is best positioned to take advantage of that. Particularly the middle class Timu and that garbage PDD got uh a share of the pie when people were poor during COVID and bought garbage. Now that the middle class is reemerging and getting their confidence back, Taoba Teeal controls the middle class spend and is the preeminent toll taker. International stock seen as the best asset class over the next five years. uh opinion follows trend. It&#39;s amazing when you have 15 percentage of outperformance. Goldman Sachs top down S&amp;P 500 forecast 12 months out 6500. So that&#39;s opinion follows trend. They went down when the market went down. Now they&#39;re back up. They blow like a you know in California now I understand blowing like like the wind like a palm tree in the wind. Uh that&#39;s most of the sell side earnings growth. And by the way, that&#39;s why they keep their jobs. If they were like an oak tree, uh and they and they fought the wind, they would snap. Uh these guys blow with the wind. So like a palm tree, they always bounce back and keep their jobs. uh earnings growth proform earnings uh year-over-year. You can see uh unmagnificent 493 accelerating mag 7 collapsing. That&#39;s not new. We&#39;ve covered that almost every week. China retail sales year reacelerating like we haven&#39;t seen since 2022 and prior to that uh 2020 when all the equities were off the charts. game is just beginning. Retail flows have recently been stronger than average and they&#39;ve been right. Okay, by the way, they were uh buying the dip in COVID uh international relative to the rest of the world stocks since 1950. So, you can see here this concentration that&#39;s going to get smacked already has this year. It&#39;s going to continue to get smacked when you have this concentration like you saw in 2019. And most people don&#39;t know that they&#39;re still stuck in this and they&#39;re all on one side of the boat about to get drowned um because they think they own 500 stocks and they don&#39;t understand what a cap weight it is index is relative to an equal weight uh relative to exposure to a manager that specializes in the green area which is looking through the windshield versus the rear view mirror. Median twoe S&amp;P 500 return since 1950. uh second half of June. Okay. Tends to be weak. We&#39;ll see what happens. GS social I I I think we pulled forward a lot of the weakness that was supposed to happen in June and got it in um April and May, but let&#39;s see. GS social media economic sentiment index starting to move back up. FMS most underweight the US dollar in 20 years. This goes all the way back to the early 2000s, which was when what happened? International outperformed, value outperformed, small caps outperformed. What do you know? Retail investors have been selling in the last three weeks. Uh, every single consistent. Okay. Well, it&#39;s something to keep an eye on. Household allocation to US equities across global regions. US has the most concentration, which means they&#39;re overweight. those seven stocks, which by the way, the carry trade continues to unwind. We&#39;ve warned you about that. And all that hot money is coming out of those seven stocks. Underweight China, that will play catchup. More opinion follows trend. Stock market around breath thrust, which we just had 12 months later on average up 15.5%. So basically, here we are. Here&#39;s where we have to go after this level of breath thrust for the technicians out there. Investor allocation to equities at an all-time high which basically means still mag seven because of the waitings even though the earnings growth is collapsing in those kind of call it 10 names central underweight debt which is going to change now the demand for treasuries is going up. Uh Bowen and Bessant are going to get the uh SLR intact probably in coming weeks. The Genius Act was passed yesterday that&#39;ll create another trillion dollars of demand to two trillion of demand of treasuries over the next two years. Uh the game is on and then uh Trump will probably start to appoint or announce uh trial balloon names of new Fed chair. So that will act as what we call a shadow Fed chair. So Powell has effectively made himself a lame duck uh for the remainder of his term once Trump starts to announce a you know very throw very dovish names out there. The market will start to discount 100 to 200 basis points of immediate cuts uh that will come into play May of 2026. It&#39;ll start to discount it uh the third or fourth quarter of this year. So be on the lookout for that. central bank cuts at fastest pace in 2025 last month. Everyone except for Powell. Too late Powell. Um and that&#39;s that. He&#39;ll he&#39;ll he&#39;ll get away with it. He&#39;ll set the table in in Jackson Hole. He&#39;ll do the first cut in September and probably second in December and then he will be off to play congressional five days a week. I hear he&#39;s a pretty good golfer by the way. Um S&amp;P price to sales over time. Again, this is skewed by those 10 names. Decade worth of volatility in the 2020s. Uh that&#39;s interesting. Wow. More volat almost double the volatility of the 70s. The stories I heard about the 70s. That&#39;s pretty wild. Consumer balance sheet very healthy. $190 trillion of assets, $20 trillion of liabilities. That&#39;s pretty damn healthy. Fed call as of 610 2025. There&#39;s a lot of room to lever up once they get the rates under control. Powell&#39;s just kind of delaying things, but it is what it is. Fed call as of 610. That&#39;s immaterial. Results for buying S&amp;P on the last day of loss exceeds 12%. No one cares. cumulative retail sales January through May. Total short interest ticking up. So, last time we saw short interest get this high was like the the whole in 2016 and you had a monster rally the next couple of years. Um, you know, these guys are forced buyers. this amount of short interest the whole way up from 2020 from 2022 higher. They just kept shorting and shorting shorting. So now they&#39;re going to be forced buyers as this thing pushes to new highs. Huge move into Euro zone and emerging markets out of US and US dollar. We&#39;ve been calling for that for a while. into the euro, into healthcare, by the way, into industrials, slowly out of tech, out of Japan, uh, out of the US dollar. Record high foreign ownership of the US stock market that&#39;s starting to decline, underweight energy, we see it in the comm stocks, Christmas in July, NASDAQ&#39;s 12-day midyear rally. So markets tend to have a massive rally in the first 12 trading days of July. You do not want to get short ahead of that. If you want to lighten up, do so after alltime highs sometime in August. But basically, it just grinds sideways till the end of year rally or net. Uh Russell 1000 versus Russell 2000. This is large cap versus small cap. This is going to mean revert like nobody&#39;s business. We have not been at this level of an extreme since 2001. Hold on to your seat belts. If you don&#39;t have small cap exposure, just, you know, look, all this is opinion, not advice, but at least get yourself uh an ETF if you don&#39;t have a manager who can pick the best stocks for you. Um, so click on terms here, opinion, not advice. Talk to your financial adviser be before doing anything. Speaking of which, we are going to be opening up again for Q3 uh for the smaller accounts, the $1 million and above. So, those of you who are interested in getting in queue for that and having a conversation so you can be ready to go Jy 1st, uh click on go to headphone tips, click on money management, uh and we&#39;ll have a chat. This is uh not a solicitation. All this is opinion, not advice. Do whatever you want. Check with your financial advisor first. Uh Bloomberg trade policy index S&amp;P year to date trade policy uncertainty. So that&#39;s that&#39;s getting more certain. Companies that reduce shares at low valuations tend to outperform annualized performance 1986 to 2025. Uh the per the the greatest example of this under the sun is what Alibaba did buying back stock between $60 and $80. I mean they couldn&#39;t have done any better. I&#39;d say another one that did a good job was 10 cent. It&#39;s amazing these Chinese companies, they were smart enough to have cash reserves and they were twice as smart to deploy them in the hole when everyone was ducked under the desk. And uh you know now these stocks are up 100% and not even starting to move yet. They&#39;re the the beginning of their moves is just now. Um but they did the exact right thing. You rarely see that with US managers. What you see with US managers unfortunately is after the stock has had you know a huge run 4x 5x they start buying back stocks so they can sell their ESOP plans into the liquidity created by the company which is you know a crime. It&#39;s it&#39;s not a literal crime. It&#39;s a figurative crime and it&#39;s ripping you off as as owners. But uh it is what it is. Companies that reduce shares at low. Okay. Valuation matters. It didn&#39;t it just didn&#39;t for the 2010s. Uh so if you go back IBIDA enterprise value dramatically outperform from 86 to 2006. We&#39;ve been through this and that&#39;s that on the data front. So, a lot of great stuff there. Some\n\n### MACRO_DATA_SLIDES\nlong only funds cyclical versus defensive positioning is very low versus history. So when we think about cyclicals think consumer discretionary like the the VF corpse etc. Energy tech industrials like the Generax like the Stanley Black & Deckers materials like the Albamaro tech like the Intels. We're going to talk about some developments there. Hedge funds are underweight cyclicals relative to defensives. always want to take the other side of the trade where the boat is crowded. Relative positioning at historic lows, which means we're going to see rip your face off moves uh in these baskets, which we have great exposure to. US dollar early stage secular bare market deterioration of the US government balance sheet, Fed policy, credibility and independence, new catalyst for China, Europe and Japan equities. Uh we can this has been a theme for us. We came into the year talking weak dollar. Everyone thought we were crazy. It continues to persist. Uh this is probably the most important data point of the week. And some of you are going to have a tough time understanding this one. Um uh and that's okay. Don't worry about it. I'll do my best to explain it. But what this chart is, it shows select growth and quality factors, percentage of respondents. This is the uh institutional manager survey. Percentage of respondents using return on equity edged higher in 2024. So what you can see is the quote unquote value investor of yestery year um has been forced into this new framework which basically means they've become closet indexers and they have justified it by calling it quality uh or growth at a reasonable price and uh it's masqueraded in the concept of return on equity or more commonly return on invested capital. Now return on equity and return on invested capital are critically important variables. Um however they tend to be um emphasized more so as it relates to what they call quality or durable secular growers which in effect has been mag seven. It's just a code. It's a fancy way of saying I'm not a closet indexer, but when you'll look at my book, I've been I've been basically bagged in the most crowded trades uh for a while. And if you look at the greatest value investors of all time, uh, that made billions in the 70s when the stock market did nothing from 1968 to 1972, whether it was Buffett or Cooperman or Gabelli, uh, kind of the value mafia I grew up with. Um, uh, no one is talking in those terms. No one is talking about the investing style of turnaround Tom that Buffett did when he was running his partnerships and shot the lights out before rolling his LPs into a permanent capital vehicle called Berkshire Hathaway. And uh what I'm the point that I'm making with this chart is that um and I was I was texting with a friend. I said so so these annotations are my own. The red being everyone now focused on quote unquote quality, return on equity. Uh whereas these periods in green are cyclicals value and turnaround turnaround Tom type of stuff. And um you can see the dramatic outperformance from 2001 to 2007. We've talked about that a lot. And then in the early 90s also in the 80s and then in a big way in the 70s. As a matter of fact, you know, we've we've talked about it. uh value has outperformed growth uh including this aberrational zerp period by 4% and change per year since 1927 including the last 10 years when we had zero interest rate policy which means if you had invested a million dollars in 1927 in value or growth uh you would have 68 million more dollars if you chose value. So what I told my friend is another way to look at it is follows. Quote, \"If I were looking in the rear view mirror, what would be the most important metric to be overweight?\" And what everyone was going to say is quality, uh, high return on equity, secular grower, aka code for mag 7, what worked yesterday. Uh, the church of what worked yesterday. Now much of the value quote unquote community is now singing from the same himnil because they've been forced to in order to survive. Most do don't do turnarounds well. They don't understand the the the framework and the formula that works. Um so they they and the and the value traps that they had been in uh certainly didn't work. So they've kind of moved into being growth investors without admitting it and just closet indexing. We are taking the exact opposite tact and believe those who have overweight exposure to the green cyclicals value turnarounds that are just starting to uh rock and roll following the once in aundredyear uh situation created by co uh will dramatically outperform the next 3 to 5 years. Even those who take the view that capital light has changed the game. So everyone that's now chasing what worked yesterday and focused on quality secular growers, high return on invested capital, high return on equity, which over time is a good formula to have except when everyone else is doing it. Um would be advised to at least hedge that view with solid green exposure in case the historical cycle proves to be recurrent. And I say in case to be gentle when the historic recurrent cycle proves to come back. Uh and it's already started to happen this year as you saw and and which has been a core to our theme. International would outperform US, dollar would get weaker. Now you're going to start to see smalls outperform large. Uh record short interest in small caps. Cyclical turnarounds. We're already seeing these home runs. Whether it's uh QXO, which is a cyclical, whether it's uh uh Comtock Resource is a cyclical, that's almost up uh eight times four, that's almost up four bags now. Um and on and on. So, the the game is just beginning here. So, you know, you might feel like you missed it when you look at indices because all you're looking at is this, which is due to take a continued breather. And we've talked about Max 7 trading back to the top of the range, but not more because their earnings growth is cut in half and their capex is going through the roof. Uh the fortunes are are going to continue to be made here uh for existing clients yearto date, you know what I'm talking about and so on. So, leaving that aside, even if you're of the view uh chasing what everyone else is doing and calling it something else, you'd be very wise if you're a large capital allocator to hedge that bet and have someone who's exceptionally skilled, which is a dying breed, by the way, in these areas right here. I would say in five years, you're going to see a huge crowd get very interested in this area, but by then all the money will be made by people like me. So, um, and you, so that's the name of the game. Uh, huge reversal in fund manager survey recession expectations in the last two months. Went from the tariffs to not the tariffs. So, this weekend, maybe Trump drops a a bunker bomb, maybe he doesn't. Market's a little jittery, but we'll get through that and we'll have an outcome by Monday for sure. Uh, FMS investors view corporate balance sheets as the best health since March of 2016. They've delevered. That's a good thing. Just like household balance sheets had. Oh, and by the way, uh here's my beautiful hedge fund tips with Tom Hayes mug. Price is what you pay. Value is what you get. Uh thanks for everyone sending in pictures. We got a new photo. Thanks just for sending it in, but the guy sent a picture of his cat. So, I don't know if that counts, but we did post them up with some of the other photos we've already gotten in. When you place an order, uh and I think the golf shirts are back in. Uh the t-shirts have been a big hit. obviously the hats and mugs, but um send your picture to we we have so many orders and so few pictures. So, stop being shy. If you want, just put a fake name or whatever and we'll we'll post you. But, uh we covered these last week. Uh a lot of hats and t-shirts. So this is our latest from Don G who is a cat reading the intelligent investor by Ben Graham and uh sitting next to his hedge fund tips hat. Best performing asset in the next 5 years fund manager survey says international stocks opinion follows trend. What a difference a half a year makes. Couldn't give away international when we were pounding the table. Now everyone wants it. It's just getting started ladies and gentlemen. uh asset quilt of total returns. Uh MSCI EA is up 18% year-to date. Emerging markets up 13.9%. Uh S&P up only 3%. REITs up 5%. Uh global high yield cash and commodities. So that's that. We've seen very few instances where gold is at the top of the range for more than two years. The last time that happened was uh 2010 to 2011. The next year it fell to third to the bottom. The following year after that it had the absolute worst performance. So for everyone chasing gold up here, God help you. Investors on EPS and leverage net percent of FMS investors think that global corporate profit growth will improve. That's coming off the lows, but it's at levels like you saw in COVID, like you saw in the tech wreck in 2022, and like you saw in the great financial crisis and the tech wreck of 20201. The sentiment is still subdued. Midcap ETFs accelerating in inflows. This is the theme. small and midcap starting to play just like you saw in 2001 to 2003 and then straight through outperformance to 2007. Lower financial leverage than 20 thou uh 1990s and 2000s. You can look at the balance sheet here. We haven't had this low leverage since the mid80s for corporate balance sheets. Global materials still dramatically underweight. That's where Albamaro in a quasi related sense, Comtock Resources, that's why you're starting to see huge moves there. Uh, household holdings as equity of equities as a percentage of total financial assets. This is US equities, ladies and gentlemen. And honestly, we haven't had this highest percentage since ' 68. Um, market kind of topped out in ' 68 and certainly started to collapse from 72 to 74. uh 2000 and 2024. Now you have to consider that top 10 stocks is still 40% of the S&P 500. So what this means is the overweight relative to everything else. Same thing in 2000 if you remember the magazine covers uh in 1999 saying has Warren Buffett lost his touch and Warren Buffett was buying Proctor and Gamble. he was buying all these defensive stocks, uh, staple stocks, boring stocks, industrial stocks at the top of the quote unquote market in 2000. And in 2001 and 2002, while the NASDAQ crashed 90, his stocks rocketed. So, you're thinking like, well, if the market crashes, um, would, you know, wouldn't everything crash? And the answer is no when you have such a concentrated period, if you are in the right things. And that's why you need to hedge out with especially if you're a large allocator with someone who is a specialist in the greens unless you think this is going to be the exception where this doesn't revert to the mean and those top 10 weights meaning 40% don't underperform for the next handful of years and our case is that they will and they have and you've seen it year to date even though they're bouncing back in the range. We had said that they will bounce back to the top of the range and in aggregate not overtake if you take a mags versus you know one stock someone will say well what about Microsoft or what about one of these that's making new highs yeah there will be one or two but you you know you look at uh Tesla is still down Google's still down even Amazon which is probably a buy um so so you want to f to make massive amounts of money in the next two to three years you need to find what's not in these percentages that are going going to be a uh at the effect of mean reversion. Bank of America global fund manager survey investor sentiment improves slightly from May uh via bearish April level. Again, you see these levels only at the 2022 lows, the COVID lows, uh the first trade war, the EU debt crisis, great financial crisis and 9/11. So, uh, for those who think that everyone's too bullish and therefore we're going to crash, uh, they're absolutely incorrect. I I think after we get through this Iran volatility, uh, we're going to push to new highs before the end of summer, probably before the end of July. Bubbles, uh, you can see past bubbles, ARC, and Bitcoin, which is an interesting one that Bank of America points out here. uh you had uh smaller China in the late uh uh 2010s or 2000s 2007 to 2009 that is going to recur in our view uh over the next two years. There will be a final blowoff for China just like you had the final blowoff for Japan in the late 80s and we're going to benefit from that with Baba. Growth has underperformed value by 7 percentage points so far this year. Uh that was also part of the theme. Value dispersion peaks usually precede value cycles. the cycles we talked about. What's the cycle is making sure you have a manager that's expert in these areas because the cycle value cycle is just beginning. Uh and if you know what you're doing, it's like it's literally like a treasure hunt every single day. Uh value trades well below historic average versus growth. You can see here this is plus or minus two standard deviations. We're probably about halfway there. And then valuation strategies for information technology. Uh price to free cash flow outperformed the index the most over the last uh 45 40 years. And that's buying low price to free cash flow is the name of the game right now. That's not popular. That will come back very very it's already coming back. This year has been the inflection point. Large caps relative performance total return of growth versus value. You can see here this extreme not seen since 2000. And then prior to that 1980 and we know what happened next. Value dramatically outperformed. S&P 500 increasingly topheavy. again top 10 largest S&P companies as a percentage of the S&P almost 40% 38% this will revert in 2000 it was 25% you'll have your people come out and say well this time it's different cap light blah blah blah I heard the same story about eyeballs in 1999 AI is certainly going to change the world just like the internet did the question is how much have you already\nShort interest has risen in 2025 that creates the next buyers which is why I&#39;m been pushing we&#39;re going to new highs before the end of summer. FMS investors are net 38% underweight US equities, the most since May of 2023. This has hockey stick since the beginning of the year. We called this on the podcast aggressively in the fourth quarter of last year. Go back and look at the tapes. More downside for dollar expected. Opinion follows trend. That&#39;s from Bloomberg. Economists raise China growth exports outlook for 2025. composition of the $81 trillion global equity market. You can see here US is 64%. The earnings power is nowhere near that percentage of the overall equity pie and that will revert and we&#39;ve seen the beginnings of that this year. Long emerging markets again one standard deviation below the means. Uh, and the last times you got to this was 20201, which was you never made more money in a shorter period of time than being long emerging markets, small caps in value from 2001 to 2007. Everything&#39;s pointing to the same thing. Very similar. Why did you see a lot of these managers make billions in the 70s when the stock market did nothing? Small caps outperformed. It was a stock picker paradise. Same thing&#39;s going to happen now. Um and by the way, same thing in the second um term of uh Reagan uh in the late 80s from 85 to 90 and early part of Bush one. Target rate probabilities for September 17th meeting up to 64% now. first cut. We covered that on Vney AI. Bulls minus bears. Again, not at extreme. We push higher, ladies and gentlemen. Uh 6 months later on average 10%, one year later, 21%. S&amp;P 500, you can see here, making an aggressive what they call a cup and handle. Measured move would imply 4900 to 6,000 is,00 measured move would imply 7,100 probably by sometime in 2026. Yet another sign this is a bull market. Uh after 2 months of gains in the S&amp;P of 20% or more 1950 to today, one year out on average up 30%, 6 months out on average 16%. Economists expect Germany to grow again this year. that is from negative earnings growth to positive earnings growth starting this year and reacelerating 2026 2027. That helps the European theme that helps our GXO position which we talked about with Stew. Uh by the way, I got some incredible news. I&#39;m going to just skip to it right now. uh literally it must have been either while I was talking to Vney uh or shortly thereafter GXO announces completion of the UK regulatory review of Winkitin acquisition and raises full year 2025 guidance. So this is what I said as one of the two catalyst for GXO to get to 60 before the end of the year and probably more by the way. uh largest pure play contract logistics provider announced that the UK competition markets CMA has cleared GXO&#39;s acquisition of Winkitin subject to the devestment of a small number of Wikington grocery contracts in the UK which is less than probably less than 3% of total revenues of Winkitin uh and that invest integration will be permitted with the vast majority of the Winkutin business once certain administrative conditions are met. The company also announced today that it is raising fullear guidance on organic revenue growth, adjusted IBIDA and adjusted diluted EPS. We are pleased with the regulatory review. Excited to bring the two businesses together combination offering uh customers across the UK, Ireland bring presence in strategic verticals that will serve as a springboard for growth. Well positioned to move forward swiftly and look forward to welcoming the Winkington team to GXO. updated fullear guidance organic revenue growth. Uh the midpoint was brought up to 5% from 4 a.5% organic revenue growth. IBIDA midpoint uh from 850 to 870. So 20 more million of adjusted IBIDA. EPS midpoint 253 from 250 and uh free cash flow conversion to 30% mid-range. So all of this super exciting news. Pretty timely for that interview this morning. Uh better to be lucky than to be good sometimes. So uh earnings of MCI China continue to uh shoot upward. compound annual growth rate over the next seven years expected to be uh let&#39;s see here what are we talking about somewhere around 9 10% US uh with the implication being the value intrinsic value of the businesses off of normalized value multiples would be double off of depressed multiples will probably be quadruple FYI so Um, Goldman holdings in Chinese equities as a percentage of total AUM is uh 1.6% the benchmark is 5% managers are 3.4% underweight Chinese equities. The catch-up is going to be violent violent to the upside if you don&#39;t have it. Uh, can&#39;t help you. An overlooked boom in China. 15 major economies with the highest growth rate of household spending in this century. Uh that game is back on. We&#39;re going to cover a couple of things about that. China&#39;s consumption gets a boost from tradein subsidies, household appliances and video equipment, furniture, communication appliance, automobiles, retail sales. This is called Alibaba is the toll taker. 40 cents of every retail dollar spent on e-commerce goes through Taoba T- Mall. Uh the government has committed to 70% internal consumption. uh and Baba is best positioned to take advantage of that. Particularly the middle class Timu and that garbage PDD got uh a share of the pie when people were poor during COVID and bought garbage. Now that the middle class is reemerging and getting their confidence back, Taoba Teeal controls the middle class spend and is the preeminent toll taker. International stock seen as the best asset class over the next five years. uh opinion follows trend. It&#39;s amazing when you have 15 percentage of outperformance. Goldman Sachs top down S&amp;P 500 forecast 12 months out 6500. So that&#39;s opinion follows trend. They went down when the market went down. Now they&#39;re back up. They blow like a you know in California now I understand blowing like like the wind like a palm tree in the wind. Uh that&#39;s most of the sell side earnings growth. And by the way, that&#39;s why they keep their jobs. If they were like an oak tree, uh and they and they fought the wind, they would snap. Uh these guys blow with the wind. So like a palm tree, they always bounce back and keep their jobs. uh earnings growth proform earnings uh year-over-year. You can see uh unmagnificent 493 accelerating mag 7 collapsing. That&#39;s not new. We&#39;ve covered that almost every week. China retail sales year reacelerating like we haven&#39;t seen since 2022 and prior to that uh 2020 when all the equities were off the charts. game is just beginning. Retail flows have recently been stronger than average and they&#39;ve been right. Okay, by the way, they were uh buying the dip in COVID uh international relative to the rest of the world stocks since 1950. So, you can see here this concentration that&#39;s going to get smacked already has this year. It&#39;s going to continue to get smacked when you have this concentration like you saw in 2019. And most people don&#39;t know that they&#39;re still stuck in this and they&#39;re all on one side of the boat about to get drowned um because they think they own 500 stocks and they don&#39;t understand what a cap weight it is index is relative to an equal weight uh relative to exposure to a manager that specializes in the green area which is looking through the windshield versus the rear view mirror. Median twoe S&amp;P 500 return since 1950. uh second half of June. Okay. Tends to be weak. We&#39;ll see what happens. GS social I I I think we pulled forward a lot of the weakness that was supposed to happen in June and got it in um April and May, but let&#39;s see. GS social media economic sentiment index starting to move back up. FMS most underweight the US dollar in 20 years. This goes all the way back to the early 2000s, which was when what happened? International outperformed, value outperformed, small caps outperformed. What do you know? Retail investors have been selling in the last three weeks. Uh, every single consistent. Okay. Well, it&#39;s something to keep an eye on. Household allocation to US equities across global regions. US has the most concentration, which means they&#39;re overweight. those seven stocks, which by the way, the carry trade continues to unwind. We&#39;ve warned you about that. And all that hot money is coming out of those seven stocks. Underweight China, that will play catchup. More opinion follows trend. Stock market around breath thrust, which we just had 12 months later on average up 15.5%. So basically, here we are. Here&#39;s where we have to go after this level of breath thrust for the technicians out there. Investor allocation to equities at an all-time high which basically means still mag seven because of the waitings even though the earnings growth is collapsing in those kind of call it 10 names central underweight debt which is going to change now the demand for treasuries is going up. Uh Bowen and Bessant are going to get the uh SLR intact probably in coming weeks. The Genius Act was passed yesterday that&#39;ll create another trillion dollars of demand to two trillion of demand of treasuries over the next two years. Uh the game is on and then uh Trump will probably start to appoint or announce uh trial balloon names of new Fed chair. So that will act as what we call a shadow Fed chair. So Powell has effectively made himself a lame duck uh for the remainder of his term once Trump starts to announce a you know very throw very dovish names out there. The market will start to discount 100 to 200 basis points of immediate cuts uh that will come into play May of 2026. It&#39;ll start to discount it uh the third or fourth quarter of this year. So be on the lookout for that. central bank cuts at fastest pace in 2025 last month. Everyone except for Powell. Too late Powell. Um and that&#39;s that. He&#39;ll he&#39;ll he&#39;ll get away with it. He&#39;ll set the table in in Jackson Hole. He&#39;ll do the first cut in September and probably second in December and then he will be off to play congressional five days a week. I hear he&#39;s a pretty good golfer by the way. Um S&amp;P price to sales over time. Again, this is skewed by those 10 names. Decade worth of volatility in the 2020s. Uh that&#39;s interesting. Wow. More volat almost double the volatility of the 70s. The stories I heard about the 70s. That&#39;s pretty wild. Consumer balance sheet very healthy. $190 trillion of assets, $20 trillion of liabilities. That&#39;s pretty damn healthy. Fed call as of 610 2025. There&#39;s a lot of room to lever up once they get the rates under control. Powell&#39;s just kind of delaying things, but it is what it is. Fed call as of 610. That&#39;s immaterial. Results for buying S&amp;P on the last day of loss exceeds 12%. No one cares. cumulative retail sales January through May. Total short interest ticking up. So, last time we saw short interest get this high was like the the whole in 2016 and you had a monster rally the next couple of years. Um, you know, these guys are forced buyers. this amount of short interest the whole way up from 2020 from 2022 higher. They just kept shorting and shorting shorting. So now they&#39;re going to be forced buyers as this thing pushes to new highs. Huge move into Euro zone and emerging markets out of US and US dollar. We&#39;ve been calling for that for a while. into the euro, into healthcare, by the way, into industrials, slowly out of tech, out of Japan, uh, out of the US dollar. Record high foreign ownership of the US stock market that&#39;s starting to decline, underweight energy, we see it in the comm stocks, Christmas in July, NASDAQ&#39;s 12-day midyear rally. So markets tend to have a massive rally in the first 12 trading days of July. You do not want to get short ahead of that. If you want to lighten up, do so after alltime highs sometime in August. But basically, it just grinds sideways till the end of year rally or net. Uh Russell 1000 versus Russell 2000. This is large cap versus small cap. This is going to mean revert like nobody&#39;s business. We have not been at this level of an extreme since 2001. Hold on to your seat belts. If you don&#39;t have small cap exposure, just, you know, look, all this is opinion, not advice, but at least get yourself uh an ETF if you don&#39;t have a manager who can pick the best stocks for you. Um, so click on terms here, opinion, not advice. Talk to your financial adviser be before doing anything. Speaking of which, we are going to be opening up again for Q3 uh for the smaller accounts, the $1 million and above. So, those of you who are interested in getting in queue for that and having a conversation so you can be ready to go Jy 1st, uh click on go to headphone tips, click on money management, uh and we&#39;ll have a chat. This is uh not a solicitation. All this is opinion, not advice. Do whatever you want. Check with your financial advisor first. Uh Bloomberg trade policy index S&amp;P year to date trade policy uncertainty. So that&#39;s that&#39;s getting more certain. Companies that reduce shares at low valuations tend to outperform annualized performance 1986 to 2025. Uh the per the the greatest example of this under the sun is what Alibaba did buying back stock between $60 and $80. I mean they couldn&#39;t have done any better. I&#39;d say another one that did a good job was 10 cent. It&#39;s amazing these Chinese companies, they were smart enough to have cash reserves and they were twice as smart to deploy them in the hole when everyone was ducked under the desk. And uh you know now these stocks are up 100% and not even starting to move yet. They&#39;re the the beginning of their moves is just now. Um but they did the exact right thing. You rarely see that with US managers. What you see with US managers unfortunately is after the stock has had you know a huge run 4x 5x they start buying back stocks so they can sell their ESOP plans into the liquidity created by the company which is you know a crime. It&#39;s it&#39;s not a literal crime. It&#39;s a figurative crime and it&#39;s ripping you off as as owners. But uh it is what it is. Companies that reduce shares at low. Okay. Valuation matters. It didn&#39;t it just didn&#39;t for the 2010s. Uh so if you go back IBIDA enterprise value dramatically outperform from 86 to 2006. We&#39;ve been through this and that&#39;s that on the data front. So, a lot of great stuff there. Some\n\nearnings top 30 weights of financials last 60 days revised up uh 0.19% and 06% for 2025. What was one of those companies that got revised up was PayPal, baby. Healthcare top 30 weights revisions last 60 days down 3% and 2.85% 8 5% in 2025 and 2026 respectively. Let&#39;s see what were the biggest downs. Lily. Uh so pro probably a lot of these um GLP1s. Okay, if you remember uh that let&#39;s see here Sigma probably a little unh there. ### MACRO_DATA_SLIDES retail sales were down. So, you know, Powell has all the cover to act if he wants to. He doesn&#39;t want to because he doesn&#39;t understand history. He thinks this is the 70s. This has no resemblance to the 70s, but it&#39;ll be what it&#39;ll be. Powell, Trump will start name dropping, doing some trial bombs for a shadow Fed. Everyone will ignore Powell will be a lame duck till the end of his term, and people will start to price in 200 basis points of cuts for next May uh in the coming two quarters. Uh earnings growth low bar for Q2. Expectations are 4.9% earnings growth down from 9.3% at the end of March which sets up the stage for earnings beat and a continuation of the rally through midsummer before we get into the normal chop sideways stuff August, September, October prior to year end rally.",
    "TECHNICAL_CHARTS": "\n\n### MACRO_DATA_SLIDES\nlong only funds cyclical versus defensive positioning is very low versus history. So when we think about cyclicals think consumer discretionary like the the VF corpse etc. Energy tech industrials like the Generax like the Stanley Black & Deckers materials like the Albamaro tech like the Intels. We're going to talk about some developments there. Hedge funds are underweight cyclicals relative to defensives. always want to take the other side of the trade where the boat is crowded. Relative positioning at historic lows, which means we're going to see rip your face off moves uh in these baskets, which we have great exposure to. US dollar early stage secular bare market deterioration of the US government balance sheet, Fed policy, credibility and independence, new catalyst for China, Europe and Japan equities. Uh we can this has been a theme for us. We came into the year talking weak dollar. Everyone thought we were crazy. It continues to persist. Uh this is probably the most important data point of the week. And some of you are going to have a tough time understanding this one. Um uh and that's okay. Don't worry about it. I'll do my best to explain it. But what this chart is, it shows select growth and quality factors, percentage of respondents. This is the uh institutional manager survey. Percentage of respondents using return on equity edged higher in 2024. So what you can see is the quote unquote value investor of yestery year um has been forced into this new framework which basically means they've become closet indexers and they have justified it by calling it quality uh or growth at a reasonable price and uh it's masqueraded in the concept of return on equity or more commonly return on invested capital. Now return on equity and return on invested capital are critically important variables. Um however they tend to be um emphasized more so as it relates to what they call quality or durable secular growers which in effect has been mag seven. It's just a code. It's a fancy way of saying I'm not a closet indexer, but when you'll look at my book, I've been I've been basically bagged in the most crowded trades uh for a while. And if you look at the greatest value investors of all time, uh, that made billions in the 70s when the stock market did nothing from 1968 to 1972, whether it was Buffett or Cooperman or Gabelli, uh, kind of the value mafia I grew up with. Um, uh, no one is talking in those terms. No one is talking about the investing style of turnaround Tom that Buffett did when he was running his partnerships and shot the lights out before rolling his LPs into a permanent capital vehicle called Berkshire Hathaway. And uh what I'm the point that I'm making with this chart is that um and I was I was texting with a friend. I said so so these annotations are my own. The red being everyone now focused on quote unquote quality, return on equity. Uh whereas these periods in green are cyclicals value and turnaround turnaround Tom type of stuff. And um you can see the dramatic outperformance from 2001 to 2007. We've talked about that a lot. And then in the early 90s also in the 80s and then in a big way in the 70s. As a matter of fact, you know, we've we've talked about it. uh value has outperformed growth uh including this aberrational zerp period by 4% and change per year since 1927 including the last 10 years when we had zero interest rate policy which means if you had invested a million dollars in 1927 in value or growth uh you would have 68 million more dollars if you chose value. So what I told my friend is another way to look at it is follows. Quote, \"If I were looking in the rear view mirror, what would be the most important metric to be overweight?\" And what everyone was going to say is quality, uh, high return on equity, secular grower, aka code for mag 7, what worked yesterday. Uh, the church of what worked yesterday. Now much of the value quote unquote community is now singing from the same himnil because they've been forced to in order to survive. Most do don't do turnarounds well. They don't understand the the the framework and the formula that works. Um so they they and the and the value traps that they had been in uh certainly didn't work. So they've kind of moved into being growth investors without admitting it and just closet indexing. We are taking the exact opposite tact and believe those who have overweight exposure to the green cyclicals value turnarounds that are just starting to uh rock and roll following the once in aundredyear uh situation created by co uh will dramatically outperform the next 3 to 5 years. Even those who take the view that capital light has changed the game. So everyone that's now chasing what worked yesterday and focused on quality secular growers, high return on invested capital, high return on equity, which over time is a good formula to have except when everyone else is doing it. Um would be advised to at least hedge that view with solid green exposure in case the historical cycle proves to be recurrent. And I say in case to be gentle when the historic recurrent cycle proves to come back. Uh and it's already started to happen this year as you saw and and which has been a core to our theme. International would outperform US, dollar would get weaker. Now you're going to start to see smalls outperform large. Uh record short interest in small caps. Cyclical turnarounds. We're already seeing these home runs. Whether it's uh QXO, which is a cyclical, whether it's uh uh Comtock Resource is a cyclical, that's almost up uh eight times four, that's almost up four bags now. Um and on and on. So, the the game is just beginning here. So, you know, you might feel like you missed it when you look at indices because all you're looking at is this, which is due to take a continued breather. And we've talked about Max 7 trading back to the top of the range, but not more because their earnings growth is cut in half and their capex is going through the roof. Uh the fortunes are are going to continue to be made here uh for existing clients yearto date, you know what I'm talking about and so on. So, leaving that aside, even if you're of the view uh chasing what everyone else is doing and calling it something else, you'd be very wise if you're a large capital allocator to hedge that bet and have someone who's exceptionally skilled, which is a dying breed, by the way, in these areas right here. I would say in five years, you're going to see a huge crowd get very interested in this area, but by then all the money will be made by people like me. So, um, and you, so that's the name of the game. Uh, huge reversal in fund manager survey recession expectations in the last two months. Went from the tariffs to not the tariffs. So, this weekend, maybe Trump drops a a bunker bomb, maybe he doesn't. Market's a little jittery, but we'll get through that and we'll have an outcome by Monday for sure. Uh, FMS investors view corporate balance sheets as the best health since March of 2016. They've delevered. That's a good thing. Just like household balance sheets had. Oh, and by the way, uh here's my beautiful hedge fund tips with Tom Hayes mug. Price is what you pay. Value is what you get. Uh thanks for everyone sending in pictures. We got a new photo. Thanks just for sending it in, but the guy sent a picture of his cat. So, I don't know if that counts, but we did post them up with some of the other photos we've already gotten in. When you place an order, uh and I think the golf shirts are back in. Uh the t-shirts have been a big hit. obviously the hats and mugs, but um send your picture to we we have so many orders and so few pictures. So, stop being shy. If you want, just put a fake name or whatever and we'll we'll post you. But, uh we covered these last week. Uh a lot of hats and t-shirts. So this is our latest from Don G who is a cat reading the intelligent investor by Ben Graham and uh sitting next to his hedge fund tips hat. Best performing asset in the next 5 years fund manager survey says international stocks opinion follows trend. What a difference a half a year makes. Couldn't give away international when we were pounding the table. Now everyone wants it. It's just getting started ladies and gentlemen. uh asset quilt of total returns. Uh MSCI EA is up 18% year-to date. Emerging markets up 13.9%. Uh S&P up only 3%. REITs up 5%. Uh global high yield cash and commodities. So that's that. We've seen very few instances where gold is at the top of the range for more than two years. The last time that happened was uh 2010 to 2011. The next year it fell to third to the bottom. The following year after that it had the absolute worst performance. So for everyone chasing gold up here, God help you. Investors on EPS and leverage net percent of FMS investors think that global corporate profit growth will improve. That's coming off the lows, but it's at levels like you saw in COVID, like you saw in the tech wreck in 2022, and like you saw in the great financial crisis and the tech wreck of 20201. The sentiment is still subdued. Midcap ETFs accelerating in inflows. This is the theme. small and midcap starting to play just like you saw in 2001 to 2003 and then straight through outperformance to 2007. Lower financial leverage than 20 thou uh 1990s and 2000s. You can look at the balance sheet here. We haven't had this low leverage since the mid80s for corporate balance sheets. Global materials still dramatically underweight. That's where Albamaro in a quasi related sense, Comtock Resources, that's why you're starting to see huge moves there. Uh, household holdings as equity of equities as a percentage of total financial assets. This is US equities, ladies and gentlemen. And honestly, we haven't had this highest percentage since ' 68. Um, market kind of topped out in ' 68 and certainly started to collapse from 72 to 74. uh 2000 and 2024. Now you have to consider that top 10 stocks is still 40% of the S&P 500. So what this means is the overweight relative to everything else. Same thing in 2000 if you remember the magazine covers uh in 1999 saying has Warren Buffett lost his touch and Warren Buffett was buying Proctor and Gamble. he was buying all these defensive stocks, uh, staple stocks, boring stocks, industrial stocks at the top of the quote unquote market in 2000. And in 2001 and 2002, while the NASDAQ crashed 90, his stocks rocketed. So, you're thinking like, well, if the market crashes, um, would, you know, wouldn't everything crash? And the answer is no when you have such a concentrated period, if you are in the right things. And that's why you need to hedge out with especially if you're a large allocator with someone who is a specialist in the greens unless you think this is going to be the exception where this doesn't revert to the mean and those top 10 weights meaning 40% don't underperform for the next handful of years and our case is that they will and they have and you've seen it year to date even though they're bouncing back in the range. We had said that they will bounce back to the top of the range and in aggregate not overtake if you take a mags versus you know one stock someone will say well what about Microsoft or what about one of these that's making new highs yeah there will be one or two but you you know you look at uh Tesla is still down Google's still down even Amazon which is probably a buy um so so you want to f to make massive amounts of money in the next two to three years you need to find what's not in these percentages that are going going to be a uh at the effect of mean reversion. Bank of America global fund manager survey investor sentiment improves slightly from May uh via bearish April level. Again, you see these levels only at the 2022 lows, the COVID lows, uh the first trade war, the EU debt crisis, great financial crisis and 9/11. So, uh, for those who think that everyone's too bullish and therefore we're going to crash, uh, they're absolutely incorrect. I I think after we get through this Iran volatility, uh, we're going to push to new highs before the end of summer, probably before the end of July. Bubbles, uh, you can see past bubbles, ARC, and Bitcoin, which is an interesting one that Bank of America points out here. uh you had uh smaller China in the late uh uh 2010s or 2000s 2007 to 2009 that is going to recur in our view uh over the next two years. There will be a final blowoff for China just like you had the final blowoff for Japan in the late 80s and we're going to benefit from that with Baba. Growth has underperformed value by 7 percentage points so far this year. Uh that was also part of the theme. Value dispersion peaks usually precede value cycles. the cycles we talked about. What's the cycle is making sure you have a manager that's expert in these areas because the cycle value cycle is just beginning. Uh and if you know what you're doing, it's like it's literally like a treasure hunt every single day. Uh value trades well below historic average versus growth. You can see here this is plus or minus two standard deviations. We're probably about halfway there. And then valuation strategies for information technology. Uh price to free cash flow outperformed the index the most over the last uh 45 40 years. And that's buying low price to free cash flow is the name of the game right now. That's not popular. That will come back very very it's already coming back. This year has been the inflection point. Large caps relative performance total return of growth versus value. You can see here this extreme not seen since 2000. And then prior to that 1980 and we know what happened next. Value dramatically outperformed. S&P 500 increasingly topheavy. again top 10 largest S&P companies as a percentage of the S&P almost 40% 38% this will revert in 2000 it was 25% you'll have your people come out and say well this time it's different cap light blah blah blah I heard the same story about eyeballs in 1999 AI is certainly going to change the world just like the internet did the question is how much have you already\nShort interest has risen in 2025 that creates the next buyers which is why I&#39;m been pushing we&#39;re going to new highs before the end of summer. FMS investors are net 38% underweight US equities, the most since May of 2023. This has hockey stick since the beginning of the year. We called this on the podcast aggressively in the fourth quarter of last year. Go back and look at the tapes. More downside for dollar expected. Opinion follows trend. That&#39;s from Bloomberg. Economists raise China growth exports outlook for 2025. composition of the $81 trillion global equity market. You can see here US is 64%. The earnings power is nowhere near that percentage of the overall equity pie and that will revert and we&#39;ve seen the beginnings of that this year. Long emerging markets again one standard deviation below the means. Uh, and the last times you got to this was 20201, which was you never made more money in a shorter period of time than being long emerging markets, small caps in value from 2001 to 2007. Everything&#39;s pointing to the same thing. Very similar. Why did you see a lot of these managers make billions in the 70s when the stock market did nothing? Small caps outperformed. It was a stock picker paradise. Same thing&#39;s going to happen now. Um and by the way, same thing in the second um term of uh Reagan uh in the late 80s from 85 to 90 and early part of Bush one. Target rate probabilities for September 17th meeting up to 64% now. first cut. We covered that on Vney AI. Bulls minus bears. Again, not at extreme. We push higher, ladies and gentlemen. Uh 6 months later on average 10%, one year later, 21%. S&amp;P 500, you can see here, making an aggressive what they call a cup and handle. Measured move would imply 4900 to 6,000 is,00 measured move would imply 7,100 probably by sometime in 2026. Yet another sign this is a bull market. Uh after 2 months of gains in the S&amp;P of 20% or more 1950 to today, one year out on average up 30%, 6 months out on average 16%. Economists expect Germany to grow again this year. that is from negative earnings growth to positive earnings growth starting this year and reacelerating 2026 2027. That helps the European theme that helps our GXO position which we talked about with Stew. Uh by the way, I got some incredible news. I&#39;m going to just skip to it right now. uh literally it must have been either while I was talking to Vney uh or shortly thereafter GXO announces completion of the UK regulatory review of Winkitin acquisition and raises full year 2025 guidance. So this is what I said as one of the two catalyst for GXO to get to 60 before the end of the year and probably more by the way. uh largest pure play contract logistics provider announced that the UK competition markets CMA has cleared GXO&#39;s acquisition of Winkitin subject to the devestment of a small number of Wikington grocery contracts in the UK which is less than probably less than 3% of total revenues of Winkitin uh and that invest integration will be permitted with the vast majority of the Winkutin business once certain administrative conditions are met. The company also announced today that it is raising fullear guidance on organic revenue growth, adjusted IBIDA and adjusted diluted EPS. We are pleased with the regulatory review. Excited to bring the two businesses together combination offering uh customers across the UK, Ireland bring presence in strategic verticals that will serve as a springboard for growth. Well positioned to move forward swiftly and look forward to welcoming the Winkington team to GXO. updated fullear guidance organic revenue growth. Uh the midpoint was brought up to 5% from 4 a.5% organic revenue growth. IBIDA midpoint uh from 850 to 870. So 20 more million of adjusted IBIDA. EPS midpoint 253 from 250 and uh free cash flow conversion to 30% mid-range. So all of this super exciting news. Pretty timely for that interview this morning. Uh better to be lucky than to be good sometimes. So uh earnings of MCI China continue to uh shoot upward. compound annual growth rate over the next seven years expected to be uh let&#39;s see here what are we talking about somewhere around 9 10% US uh with the implication being the value intrinsic value of the businesses off of normalized value multiples would be double off of depressed multiples will probably be quadruple FYI so Um, Goldman holdings in Chinese equities as a percentage of total AUM is uh 1.6% the benchmark is 5% managers are 3.4% underweight Chinese equities. The catch-up is going to be violent violent to the upside if you don&#39;t have it. Uh, can&#39;t help you. An overlooked boom in China. 15 major economies with the highest growth rate of household spending in this century. Uh that game is back on. We&#39;re going to cover a couple of things about that. China&#39;s consumption gets a boost from tradein subsidies, household appliances and video equipment, furniture, communication appliance, automobiles, retail sales. This is called Alibaba is the toll taker. 40 cents of every retail dollar spent on e-commerce goes through Taoba T- Mall. Uh the government has committed to 70% internal consumption. uh and Baba is best positioned to take advantage of that. Particularly the middle class Timu and that garbage PDD got uh a share of the pie when people were poor during COVID and bought garbage. Now that the middle class is reemerging and getting their confidence back, Taoba Teeal controls the middle class spend and is the preeminent toll taker. International stock seen as the best asset class over the next five years. uh opinion follows trend. It&#39;s amazing when you have 15 percentage of outperformance. Goldman Sachs top down S&amp;P 500 forecast 12 months out 6500. So that&#39;s opinion follows trend. They went down when the market went down. Now they&#39;re back up. They blow like a you know in California now I understand blowing like like the wind like a palm tree in the wind. Uh that&#39;s most of the sell side earnings growth. And by the way, that&#39;s why they keep their jobs. If they were like an oak tree, uh and they and they fought the wind, they would snap. Uh these guys blow with the wind. So like a palm tree, they always bounce back and keep their jobs. uh earnings growth proform earnings uh year-over-year. You can see uh unmagnificent 493 accelerating mag 7 collapsing. That&#39;s not new. We&#39;ve covered that almost every week. China retail sales year reacelerating like we haven&#39;t seen since 2022 and prior to that uh 2020 when all the equities were off the charts. game is just beginning. Retail flows have recently been stronger than average and they&#39;ve been right. Okay, by the way, they were uh buying the dip in COVID uh international relative to the rest of the world stocks since 1950. So, you can see here this concentration that&#39;s going to get smacked already has this year. It&#39;s going to continue to get smacked when you have this concentration like you saw in 2019. And most people don&#39;t know that they&#39;re still stuck in this and they&#39;re all on one side of the boat about to get drowned um because they think they own 500 stocks and they don&#39;t understand what a cap weight it is index is relative to an equal weight uh relative to exposure to a manager that specializes in the green area which is looking through the windshield versus the rear view mirror. Median twoe S&amp;P 500 return since 1950. uh second half of June. Okay. Tends to be weak. We&#39;ll see what happens. GS social I I I think we pulled forward a lot of the weakness that was supposed to happen in June and got it in um April and May, but let&#39;s see. GS social media economic sentiment index starting to move back up. FMS most underweight the US dollar in 20 years. This goes all the way back to the early 2000s, which was when what happened? International outperformed, value outperformed, small caps outperformed. What do you know? Retail investors have been selling in the last three weeks. Uh, every single consistent. Okay. Well, it&#39;s something to keep an eye on. Household allocation to US equities across global regions. US has the most concentration, which means they&#39;re overweight. those seven stocks, which by the way, the carry trade continues to unwind. We&#39;ve warned you about that. And all that hot money is coming out of those seven stocks. Underweight China, that will play catchup. More opinion follows trend. Stock market around breath thrust, which we just had 12 months later on average up 15.5%. So basically, here we are. Here&#39;s where we have to go after this level of breath thrust for the technicians out there. Investor allocation to equities at an all-time high which basically means still mag seven because of the waitings even though the earnings growth is collapsing in those kind of call it 10 names central underweight debt which is going to change now the demand for treasuries is going up. Uh Bowen and Bessant are going to get the uh SLR intact probably in coming weeks. The Genius Act was passed yesterday that&#39;ll create another trillion dollars of demand to two trillion of demand of treasuries over the next two years. Uh the game is on and then uh Trump will probably start to appoint or announce uh trial balloon names of new Fed chair. So that will act as what we call a shadow Fed chair. So Powell has effectively made himself a lame duck uh for the remainder of his term once Trump starts to announce a you know very throw very dovish names out there. The market will start to discount 100 to 200 basis points of immediate cuts uh that will come into play May of 2026. It&#39;ll start to discount it uh the third or fourth quarter of this year. So be on the lookout for that. central bank cuts at fastest pace in 2025 last month. Everyone except for Powell. Too late Powell. Um and that&#39;s that. He&#39;ll he&#39;ll he&#39;ll get away with it. He&#39;ll set the table in in Jackson Hole. He&#39;ll do the first cut in September and probably second in December and then he will be off to play congressional five days a week. I hear he&#39;s a pretty good golfer by the way. Um S&amp;P price to sales over time. Again, this is skewed by those 10 names. Decade worth of volatility in the 2020s. Uh that&#39;s interesting. Wow. More volat almost double the volatility of the 70s. The stories I heard about the 70s. That&#39;s pretty wild. Consumer balance sheet very healthy. $190 trillion of assets, $20 trillion of liabilities. That&#39;s pretty damn healthy. Fed call as of 610 2025. There&#39;s a lot of room to lever up once they get the rates under control. Powell&#39;s just kind of delaying things, but it is what it is. Fed call as of 610. That&#39;s immaterial. Results for buying S&amp;P on the last day of loss exceeds 12%. No one cares. cumulative retail sales January through May. Total short interest ticking up. So, last time we saw short interest get this high was like the the whole in 2016 and you had a monster rally the next couple of years. Um, you know, these guys are forced buyers. this amount of short interest the whole way up from 2020 from 2022 higher. They just kept shorting and shorting shorting. So now they&#39;re going to be forced buyers as this thing pushes to new highs. Huge move into Euro zone and emerging markets out of US and US dollar. We&#39;ve been calling for that for a while. into the euro, into healthcare, by the way, into industrials, slowly out of tech, out of Japan, uh, out of the US dollar. Record high foreign ownership of the US stock market that&#39;s starting to decline, underweight energy, we see it in the comm stocks, Christmas in July, NASDAQ&#39;s 12-day midyear rally. So markets tend to have a massive rally in the first 12 trading days of July. You do not want to get short ahead of that. If you want to lighten up, do so after alltime highs sometime in August. But basically, it just grinds sideways till the end of year rally or net. Uh Russell 1000 versus Russell 2000. This is large cap versus small cap.

I&#39;m going to just skip to it right now. uh literally it must have been either while I was talking to Vney uh or shortly thereafter GXO announces completion of the UK regulatory review of Winkitin acquisition and raises full year 2025 guidance. So this is what I said as one of the two catalyst for GXO to get to 60 before the end of the year and probably more by the way. uh largest pure play contract logistics provider announced that the UK competition markets CMA has cleared GXO&#39;s acquisition of Winkitin subject to the devestment of a small number of Wikington grocery contracts in the UK which is less than probably less than 3% of total revenues of Winkitin uh and that invest integration will be permitted with the vast majority of the Winkutin business once certain administrative conditions are met. The company also announced today that it is raising fullear guidance on organic revenue growth, adjusted IBIDA and adjusted diluted EPS. We are pleased with the regulatory review. Excited to bring the two businesses together combination offering uh customers across the UK, Ireland bring presence in strategic verticals that will serve as a springboard for growth.

Tom Hayes, thank you very much indeed. We&#39;ll see you again real soon. And we&#39;re back then. I want to thank Chamilleia Kilawan and Diego Lahi for having me on CGTN America last night to talk Fed day. We&#39;ll listen in here. And joining us now to discuss the latest Fed rate decision is Thomas Hayes. He&#39;s founder, chairman, and managing member of Great Hill Capital. Welcome back to the show, Thomas. Uh first off, I&#39;d like to get your reaction to the decision. Uh it was expected, but is the Fed getting it right? I don&#39;t think they are. I think Powell has unintentionally put him him himself in the position of being a lame duck for the remainder of his term. I think you&#39;re going to see President Trump start to allude to the next Fed chair which will create a shadow Fed situation which is going to be a dovish Fed moving forward. And I think President Trump made a couple important points today. Number one is Powell is about 200 basis points too restrictive. meaning the Fed funds rate is about 200 basis points more than inflation and that&#39;s going going to catch up and the the concept of too late Powell uh whether you love it or don&#39;t love it, President Trump has been right every single time and I think this this situation is going to be the case this time. That&#39;s the bad news. The good news is Powell was slightly more dovish. It originally looked as if the meeting was hawkish, but he did adjust language from the firming language to the adjustments language. And I would say one last thing, Diego, is that uh the Fed is supposed to be data dependent. And the whole meeting was about him predicting that inflation was going to go up because of tariffs, even though that simply was not the case in 2018. And I think pal uh President Trump has made the point in past appearances where he said, \"Listen, why don&#39;t you just cut and if you&#39;re right about inflation, you can always raise rates. He could always do a 25 or 50 point raise if inflation ticks up from tariffs.\" But if he&#39;s wrong, he&#39;s certainly going to be too late. And that is a risk to the economy. And uh and somewhat reflected in the projections, they&#39;re still projecting two cuts towards the end of the year. If they&#39;re so sure about that, why don&#39;t they just go ahead with it? Yeah, there was a lot of caution about the effect of tariffs uh during Powell&#39;s speech today and his uh and while he fielded uh journalist",
      "Demand in 2024 was about 1.2 million and Alba Mar&#39;s high-end forecast for 2030 is 3.3. That&#39;s in line with our forecast. This guy&#39;s talking double or triple that.

Here&#39;s everything you need to know following the Q1 report. You can go through this step by step. Uh break even free cash flow in 2025. That&#39;s key in trough prices. is the fact that they can be break even. By the way, this is a dividend aristocrat. They&#39;ve raised a dividend every single year for over 30 years. Uh that&#39;s going to continue to happen. You can lock in a very uh low basis so that um as the dividend, you know, you&#39;ll lock in whatever it is 2 and a half or 3% whatever it is now. But even as the price goes up, the dividend yield on your basis is going to keep going up as they keep increasing the dividend. And then if you reinvest it, you can really compound money. Anyway, here are the 10 key points. Through April, management achieved 90% run rate against the midpoint of their 350 million cost and productivity savings program. More importantly, they&#39;ve identified additional opportunities to reach the high end of 300 to $400 million range with potential for even more upside. Adjusted Ebida margins in Q1 came in at 25% up 400 basis points year-on-year in a trough cycle. This is unbelievable. With SGNA costs down over 20% as the cost savings program continues to bear fruit. Three, in light of cycllically low prices, management continues to cut back on capex with full year 2025 expectations of 700 to 800 million, down more than 50% year-on-year. This comes down from an already low base in 2024. That was reduced by over 450 million compared to 2023&#39;s 2.1 billion of capex. The long-term midcycle capex target remains around 6% of revenues. cash from operations uh in Q1 totaled four $545 million including a 350 million customer prepayment resulting in an operating cash flow conversion of 204% excluding the prepaid pay payment conversion still came in at 73% above above the long-term average of 60 or 70% bringing fullear 2025 expectations to north of 80% five not only did management maintain their full year 2025 outlook they also reiterated their expectation of break even free cash flow for for the year after delivering slightly positive free cash flow in Q1 with positive free cash flow expected during 2026. Six, the direct impact of tariffs is expected to be minimal, totaling 30 to 40 million for the full year before any mitigations. This is largely due to Albamaro&#39;s global footprint with most lithium production sold directly to Asia and the critical mineral exemptions that are currently in place. Management has mitigations underway to significantly reduce the overall realized impact, including increased sales to lower tariff countries and optimizing supply chain. Seven management has estimated that 40% of the current global lithium capacity is at or below break even with only a third of that supply having come offline. Aka the number of the longer prices remain in the pain zone the more lowquality marginal producers will get taken out on a stretcher. Eight for the full year lithium demand is expected to grow between 15 to 40% with management currently forecasting growth around the mid 20% range. Long-term demand growth remains strong with lithium demand projected to more than 2x 2030 from 1.2 million metric tonses in 2024 and up to 3.3 million metric tonses growing at a near 20% kagger. Despite the headline noise, global EV demand continues to remain strong, up 34% yearonear. Strong sales in China continue to weigh lead the way up up 41% year-onear and remain over 60% of the total EV global EV market. Long-term demand expectations remained intact with EV market penetration expected to exceed IC by the end of the decade reaching about 54% global penetration and 10 stationary storage continues to be one of the main drivers for lithium. The market is expected to grow at 20 to 30% kagger through 2030. Uh growing from 190 to in 2024 to between 600 and 970 in 2030. Earnings call highlights you can go through at hedge funtips.com. And then um here&#39;s an article from Morning Star with a fair value. Lithium prices will rebound then remain well above the marginal cost of production through the at least the remainder of decade leading to excess profits and return on invested capital for Albamaro. Therefore, they have a $200 fair value on the stock down from 225. The stock is trading at about $60 right now. So, they&#39;re looking at a threebagger plus uh in a handful of years or less. I think it&#39;s going to be more and uh we&#39;re excited about it. So, that&#39;s that.",

      "metric ton. And Albamaro was minting more cash than they knew what to do with. But the high prices quickly brought a wave of new supply. Small-cale producers in China, many fully subsidized, flooded the market and created massive supply glut. Lithium prices came crashing down. uh and Albamaro&#39;s stock fell with them down more than 80% to where it is today. The good news for Albamaro is that as we mentioned they are the largest and lowest cost producer worldwide. This has allowed them to cut operating costs in capex and pretty much sit on their hands and wait for cycllically low lithium prices to recover. Meanwhile, the longer prices stay in the pain zone, the more lowquality marginal producers will get taken out on a stretcher. To put this into context, Albamaro Management estimates that 40% of global current lithium capacity is at or below break even only with onethird of that supply having come on coming off having come offline so far. This should continue to support Albamaro and lithium prices from the supply side with analysts expecting the supply glut to shrink and largely be gone by 2026."

      "Sagar Kaya curious your preference about Intel over AMD. Uh very simple. How many fabs does AMD have in Arizona or Ohio? And that&#39;s all you need to know is that the government, whether they like Intel or hate Intel, needs Intel. And we need to produce chips in the US. Yes, Taiwan Semiconductor uh has fabs, but they&#39;re going to need unlimited numbers. And in Intel has the 5-year runway.

I&#39;m not sold on the CEO. she&#39;s kind of been fussing around FUTZ uh for too long. So, I would like to see a replacement of the CEO if that hasn&#39;t already happened. But yeah, this is a long-term compounder with a moat. Um that&#39;s just been a little bit mismanaged of late. So, free cash flow. I mean, look, the revenues haven&#39;t begun to recover. Margins are recovering. Uh, I I I think I think this one is probably fine here. If you could get it at a 100 bucks or 110 bucks, that would be even better. But I think for the long term, this one&#39;s generally going to be okay. And I like the thing. It&#39;s one that keeps popping up that I&#39;m not doing anything with because it&#39;s not an easy double in a reasonable amount of time, but um I think you&#39;ll get nice returns and um pretty handsome dividend while you wait if I&#39;m not mistaken. Let me just see here. four 4% dividend yield while you wait. My guess, let&#39;s see what they&#39;ve been doing with the dividend."

This has always been a bad business, but let&#39;s see what it looks like now. [Music] Looks like it&#39;s recovering. SFM. Wow. Wow. Wow. Wow. Wow. Wow. This is absolutely I mean the [Music] What I can tell you is supermarkets are never a good business. So you have a run here, you&#39;re expanding, everything looks good. Eventually, you&#39;re going to hit a brick wall and you&#39;re going to crash just like you see in the Tik Tok memes where the where the 18-wheeler, you know, tests like a Land Rover test a Tesla and they all smash into the wall like an accordion. That&#39;s what happens when you own uh grocery store stock. So, I would I would just uh avoid it like the plague. It&#39;s almost as bad as airlines, except airlines you can buy cyclical troughs if their balance sheets are okay and play make a quick double or triple. But uh uh supermarkets are just bad news."

[Music] margins are holding up. Let me just see here. Pretty good balance sheet. I mean, the revenues haven&#39;t gone anywhere in six years. They&#39;re actually down. So, I just don&#39;t know what the growth story is from a stock perspective. Um, share counts been pretty steady. I mean, this is the kind of business that 20 million of free cash flow, [Music] 4% dividend yield. They don&#39;t expect growth either, paying out that kind of dividend. So you&#39;re paying enterprise value is 282 million for 20 million of free cash flow for a flat flattish business that shows no signs of growth. Uh yeah, it has definitely operating leverage relative to housing recovery, but I want to start to understand the turnaround story from management before I even look at it. I I think I mean this could easily go to 10 before it starts to recover. So management better start to show some signs of recovery because if it&#39;s if it&#39;s going to continue to have flat to negative revenue and financials, uh there&#39;s no telling how low it can go. It it had its run. It&#39;s a broken stock. You know, here we are five years later."
