[0.719s] Welcome to Hedge Fund Tips with Tom
[2.879s] Hayes. I&#39;m Tom Hayes and this is your
[5.44s] 296 video cast podcast for the week
[7.919s] ending June 19th, 2025. A lot of great
[11.2s] stuff to cover today, but as always,
[13.2s] family first. Let&#39;s get down to it. Uh
[15.519s] Annabelle concluded her 10us swim season
[18.0s] with remarkable achievements. She
[19.84s] secured an impressive 11 number one
[23.6s] national rankings this season. Set seven
[26.8s] Nova Aquatics team records, broke two
[30.08s] Southern California records in the 50
[32.48s] free and 50 back. That&#39;s all time, baby.
[35.6s] Additionally, she achieved relay
[37.68s] national records in both the long course
[39.76s] and shortc course medley relay.
[41.6s] Annabelle&#39;s birthday was this week.
[43.12s] Since turning 11, she already leads the
[45.36s] nation this season for 11year-olds in
[48.239s] the 200 IM, 400 free, and 100 back. Uh
[52.879s] Mimi had an incredible week as well,
[56.16s] enjoying the experience of a lifetime.
[58.0s] On her 13th birthday, water polo
[60.32s] superstar and gold medalist Annie Espar
[64.0s] from team Spain arranged for Mimi to be
[66.799s] the only guest at a closed scrimmage
[69.68s] between the US Olympic team and the
[72.4s] Spanish Olympic team. After the game,
[74.72s] Mimi met both the US and Spanish Olympic
[77.2s] coaches, got photos with both teams, and
[80.24s] then Tara apprentice from the USA
[82.08s] Olympic team, arranged a birthday tunnel
[84.479s] for Mimi. Mimi was given suits and caps
[87.28s] as gifts and even received an invitation
[89.2s] to come train with the Spanish team the
[91.28s] next time she is in Barcelona. It was
[93.52s] the best 13th birthday gift ever and we
[97.36s] are so grateful to Annie and Tara. So
[100.72s] there&#39;s Annabelle opening some of her
[102.4s] gifts this week. That&#39;s uh Annabelle at
[105.759s] the pool after doing all those great
[107.84s] things. That&#39;s underwater from the
[110.159s] underwater cam. Uh oh, that&#39;s Father&#39;s
[113.119s] Day. We celebrated that at Bayside in
[115.28s] Newport. Great restaurant uh on the
[117.28s] harbor there. That&#39;s me with Annabelle
[119.6s] and Mimi. This was MAC Cosmetics over at
[122.159s] Pacific City, by the way. Uh exciting.
[125.68s] Number one, that my daughter wanted to
[127.439s] go in and number two that there were
[129.119s] actually people in the store because
[131.28s] Estee Lauder owns this brand. And I was
[134.64s] asking Mimi, apparently it&#39;s getting hot
[136.4s] on social media again, even for young
[138.72s] people, after being dead in the water
[141.12s] for a while. So, continue to do my
[143.44s] channel checks. Uh, there was some of
[145.52s] Anna Mimi&#39;s birthday gifts. They&#39;re
[147.52s] they&#39;re one day apart. Uh, this is me
[150.0s] with my buddy Ralph. And by the way, I
[151.52s] want to thank Matt uh over at Mesa Verde
[155.2s] Country Club for hosting us on Tuesday.
[157.68s] Unbelievable. Ladies and gentlemen, I
[159.519s] got my first ever eagle on number four.
[163.68s] Uh, it was a 510 yard par five hit
[167.68s] driver, fiveiron, 20ft putt. Absolutely
[171.599s] unbelievable. I think it&#39;s the new
[173.2s] Bridgestone Balls. It must be the
[174.8s] equipment, right? And then this weekend
[177.599s] at the Huntington Club, uh, shot my
[180.8s] second ever 80. I still can&#39;t break 80,
[184.879s] but I shot 80 again. 3941.
[188.239s] Uh, so I&#39;m I&#39;m chipping away, ladies and
[190.879s] gentlemen. I did not give up on my goal
[192.959s] to um to break 80 and to become a high
[197.519s] singledigit handicapper. Uh the question
[200.72s] is going to be timing. So um so really
[203.04s] grateful to uh Matt over there at Mesa
[205.68s] Verde for hosting us. Uh then let&#39;s see
[209.28s] what else do we have here. Got the
[212.08s] gifts.
[214.08s] Then we&#39;ve got uh oh that&#39;s Mimi with
[218.72s] Annie Espar from the Spanish Olympic
[222.0s] team. Uh that&#39;s the USA Olympic coach
[226.56s] Adam. Then uh more great photos. That&#39;s
[230.72s] with team Spain.
[232.959s] Uh that&#39;s us at the Brandt, which is a
[235.68s] great restaurant. My friend Kenny&#39;s a
[237.519s] partial owner uh in Huntington Beach at
[240.4s] Pacific City. Definitely check out The
[242.239s] Brand. And then uh that is Team USA. So
[248.08s] pretty exciting stuff. On to it. Want to
[251.2s] thank Christian Dagger and the great
[254.319s] Stuart Vney for having me on Fox
[256.16s] Business this morning to talk the Fed,
[258.639s] talk a couple picks, talk a couple
[260.799s] names, talk a little bit of outlook.
[262.4s] We&#39;re going to listen in here. Remember,
[264.32s] the markets are closed for the Junth
[267.12s] holiday. Dow&#39;s off 300, NASDAQ&#39;s down
[270.4s] 200 points. Tom Hayes joins me now to
[272.8s] check out the market even though it&#39;s
[274.24s] closed today. All right, Tom. Uh Trump
[276.56s] says that J. pow at the Fed should lower
[278.96s] rates right now. Is he right?
[282.88s] He&#39;s not only right, he&#39;s been right
[284.72s] every single step of the way, Stu, about
[287.44s] too late Powell. So, the good news is
[289.919s] we&#39;re going to get two cuts this year.
[292.08s] 64% chance starting in September.
[294.56s] They&#39;ll probably set the table at
[296.88s] Jackson Hole. The bad news is in the
[299.44s] meantime we&#39;re paying 200 basis points
[302.56s] above inflation in terms of our debt
[306.32s] service which equates to about $600
[308.56s] billion a year. Who pays that Stu? We
[311.199s] pay that as taxpayers. It&#39;s completely
[313.28s] unnecessary. You know who else is
[314.88s] getting hurt from this wrong-minded
[316.4s] policy? The millennials. 72 million
[319.36s] millennials are trying to start a house,
[321.6s] a family, family formation. They can&#39;t
[323.919s] do it at 7.25% 25% 30-year fixed rate
[326.88s] mortgage. Home builders can&#39;t take the
[329.12s] risk with their capital at 7% uh and
[332.24s] speculate that people are going to buy
[334.0s] it. They&#39;ll just sit there in inventory.
[335.919s] We need to come down 200 basis points.
[338.56s] And President Trump has made the case if
[341.68s] he&#39;s right about his prediction that
[343.759s] inflation is going up, he can always
[345.44s] hype 25 basis points. It&#39;s much easier
[347.52s] to quell inflation than to deal with
[349.6s] deflation or unemployment by being too
[351.52s] late. Maybe this is a technical
[353.039s] question, but the president wants one
[355.44s] full percentage point drop in interest
[358.24s] rates. If he did that, would the yield
[361.199s] on the 10-year Treasury come down one
[364.0s] full percentage point, 100 basis points,
[366.24s] and would that lead to a drop in the
[368.319s] mortgage rate of one full percentage
[370.08s] point?
[371.84s] Well, they can issue shortterm notes.
[374.4s] So, that can bring down financing costs.
[376.639s] As far as the long end of the curve, uh,
[378.96s] uh, Secretary Bessant is working on that
[381.039s] with bank capital requirements this
[383.12s] summer. They&#39;ll they&#39;ll create a lot of
[385.12s] demand for banks to hold treasuries once
[387.44s] again. Uh, they can issue on the short
[389.6s] short end and do an operation twist type
[392.88s] of situation where they buy in the long
[394.72s] end of the curve, bring down 10-year
[396.24s] yields, bring down 30-year fixed rate
[398.56s] mortgages. And by the way, I I I don&#39;t
[400.56s] know if Powell will be will be
[401.759s] successful, but I do think Bessant will
[403.759s] be successful in bringing down the
[405.84s] 10-year yield, which is going to bring
[407.28s] mortgage rates below 6% before the end
[410.96s] of the year, and that&#39;s going to be a
[412.16s] good thing, as well as the stable coin
[414.639s] demand for treasuries, the bill that was
[416.24s] just passed yesterday, the Genius Act.
[418.24s] Okay, you brought two stock picks with
[420.319s] you. We got to get through them fast.
[422.16s] Uh, first off, GXO Logistics. GXO.
[426.4s] Yes. This is a Brad Jacobs company. The
[428.479s] last Brad Jacobs company I came to your
[430.24s] audience with two months ago was QXO.
[433.199s] It&#39;s up 65% in the last two months. This
[436.319s] one we believe is just taking off. It&#39;s
[438.24s] a worldwide logistics company. Two
[440.72s] catalysts. Number one, the CEO announced
[443.199s] he was retiring several months back. So,
[444.88s] we&#39;re going to get an announcement of a
[446.4s] new CEO. That&#39;s going to be a positive
[448.0s] catalyst. And number two, on June 25th,
[451.52s] the CMA, the UK regulatory body, is
[454.639s] going to rule on their Winkitin
[456.8s] acquisition whether or not they need to
[459.12s] divest the grocery business. The grocery
[461.28s] business is only 6% of the revenues of
[463.28s] Winkitin. So once that is completed,
[465.759s] they can integrate, get the cost
[467.36s] synergies, generate over 800 million of
[469.68s] IBIDA this year. We think the stock&#39;s
[471.28s] going from 42 to over 60 before the end
[473.919s] of the year. Uh that&#39;s a good one. Okay.
[476.4s] And the second one I got for you, you&#39;ve
[478.0s] only got you got 20 seconds cuz we&#39;re
[479.759s] almost out of time. Albamar, lithium
[482.08s] miner. Albamar, go. Lowest cost, one of
[484.96s] the largest lithium producers, very
[486.879s] cyclical business. Prices are in a
[488.96s] trough state. This happens every 5 to 8
[491.28s] years. The story here is energy storage
[494.4s] systems. The demand is going to go from
[496.319s] 1.2 million metric tonses to 3.2 million
[499.599s] metric tonses by 2030. Albamaro is best
[502.319s] positioned even with trough prices.
[504.319s] They&#39;re cash flow positive. Three
[505.84s] billion dollars of liquidity. This can
[507.36s] be a double to triple over the next
[509.28s] three to four years. Sue, well, that was
[510.96s] 40 seconds, but we&#39;ll let you get away
[512.8s] with it. Tom Hayes, thank you very much
[514.8s] indeed. We&#39;ll see you again real soon.
[517.76s] And we&#39;re back then. I want to thank
[521.039s] Chamilleia Kilawan and Diego Lahi for
[524.159s] having me on CGTN America last night to
[527.279s] talk Fed day. We&#39;ll listen in here. And
[529.519s] joining us now to discuss the latest Fed
[532.0s] rate decision is Thomas Hayes. He&#39;s
[534.48s] founder, chairman, and managing member
[536.64s] of Great Hill Capital. Welcome back to
[539.2s] the show, Thomas. Uh first off, I&#39;d like
[542.0s] to get your reaction to the decision. Uh
[544.64s] it was expected, but is the Fed getting
[547.279s] it right? I don&#39;t think they are. I
[550.399s] think Powell has unintentionally put him
[553.68s] him himself in the position of being a
[556.08s] lame duck for the remainder of his term.
[559.519s] I think you&#39;re going to see President
[560.88s] Trump start to allude to the next Fed
[563.44s] chair which will create a shadow Fed
[566.16s] situation which is going to be a dovish
[569.12s] Fed moving forward. And I think
[570.64s] President Trump made a couple important
[572.48s] points today. Number one is Powell is
[575.6s] about 200 basis points too restrictive.
[578.88s] meaning the Fed funds rate is about 200
[581.12s] basis points more than inflation and
[584.32s] that&#39;s going going to catch up and the
[586.08s] the concept of too late Powell uh
[589.6s] whether you love it or don&#39;t love it,
[591.519s] President Trump has been right every
[593.279s] single time and I think this this
[596.0s] situation is going to be the case this
[597.2s] time. That&#39;s the bad news. The good news
[598.72s] is Powell was slightly more dovish. It
[602.48s] originally looked as if the meeting was
[604.32s] hawkish, but he did adjust language from
[607.6s] the firming language to the adjustments
[611.2s] language. And I would say one last
[613.68s] thing, Diego, is that uh the Fed is
[616.88s] supposed to be data dependent. And the
[620.079s] whole meeting was about him predicting
[623.519s] that inflation was going to go up
[626.56s] because of tariffs, even though that
[628.32s] simply was not the case in 2018. And I
[631.68s] think pal uh President Trump has made
[633.68s] the point in past appearances where he
[636.64s] said, &quot;Listen, why don&#39;t you just cut
[639.2s] and if you&#39;re right about inflation, you
[641.12s] can always raise rates. He could always
[643.36s] do a 25 or 50 point raise if inflation
[645.68s] ticks up from tariffs.&quot; But if he&#39;s
[647.68s] wrong, he&#39;s certainly going to be too
[649.6s] late. And that is a risk to the economy.
[652.24s] And uh and somewhat reflected in the
[654.16s] projections, they&#39;re still projecting
[656.079s] two cuts towards the end of the year. If
[657.76s] they&#39;re so sure about that, why don&#39;t
[658.959s] they just go ahead with it? Yeah, there
[661.12s] was a lot of caution about the effect of
[663.12s] tariffs uh during Powell&#39;s speech today
[666.16s] and his uh and while he fielded uh
[668.88s] journalist questions, but GDP numbers
[672.48s] have not been showing signs of tariffs
[674.72s] impact so far. Uh we also got some
[678.24s] better data uh about dropping, you know,
[681.519s] sharply earlier this week. How how how
[684.48s] trade uncertainty is shaping consumer
[687.279s] spending right now?
[690.48s] Yeah, look, we saw consumer confidence
[692.8s] was okay. The GDP now numbers look
[696.079s] strong. We will not have two consecutive
[698.56s] quarters of negative GDP growth. So all
[700.56s] of that is constructive. But at the same
[703.68s] time, you have 72 millennials, million
[707.12s] millennials, the largest segment of our
[708.64s] population now, who have had to delay
[711.36s] their lives because of Jerome Powell.
[713.44s] They cannot afford houses because
[715.36s] mortgage rates are too high. uh and uh
[719.04s] and that&#39;s that&#39;s going to have knock-on
[720.8s] effects for many generations to come if
[722.88s] they don&#39;t move quickly. Uh again, the
[725.92s] the the Fed is appointed to be data
[728.88s] dependent. He is predicting and he
[731.44s] continued to predict that inflation is
[733.839s] going to go up and he may be right, but
[735.36s] if he&#39;s right, he can adjust. It&#39;s much
[738.56s] easier to bring down inflation through
[740.8s] rate cuts than to ward off deflation if
[744.079s] you get it wrong and you&#39;re too late
[745.6s] because the cost of bringing the economy
[747.839s] out of recession and the cost the
[749.76s] societal cost of unemployment
[752.32s] uh is far too great particularly when
[754.079s] you have debt to GDP of 120%. and we&#39;re
[757.04s] paying $600 billion more per year in
[760.8s] interest than we need to be doing given
[763.279s] the rate of inflation and given the rate
[765.839s] of uh employment at the moment. Yes,
[768.079s] Thomas. During his speech or during his
[770.48s] speaking this afternoon, Powell spoke
[772.399s] about when he addressed the the real
[775.44s] estate market about first the rates and
[778.32s] second about housing supply and new home
[780.88s] construction here in the US fell in May
[783.839s] to a 5-year low with economists saying
[786.16s] the housing sector is struggling to add
[789.6s] overall economic growth this year. How
[792.399s] do I look at that? Because that&#39;s a
[794.16s] longer term thing. This no this is the
[797.36s] unintended consequence of wrongminded
[800.32s] decisions by the Fed. Who&#39;s going to
[801.839s] build a house when rates are 7 725 and
[804.56s] risk capital and hope that it sells? I&#39;m
[807.2s] telling you, if rates come down below
[809.519s] 30-year fix comes below 6%, in other
[811.839s] words, if the Fed funds rate was at a
[814.16s] reasonable level, uh the demand for
[816.8s] housing would be unlimited. And you
[818.56s] couple that with the uh current
[821.2s] administration looking to deregulate.
[823.839s] They&#39;re going to open 500 something
[825.68s] thousand acres of federal land. By the
[827.68s] way, most of which in metropolitan areas
[831.279s] where there&#39;s demand for starter home
[833.76s] construction. The only thing that&#39;s
[835.2s] missing right now, the only one that&#39;s
[836.88s] delaying everything is our predictor and
[839.6s] chief Jay Powell, who is predicting what
[842.48s] he thinks might happen to inflation. If
[845.04s] he&#39;s so certain about his predictions,
[847.839s] why doesn&#39;t he look at his real GDP
[850.399s] expectations, which he cut down to 1.4%
[854.72s] real GDP for 2025 if he believes in his
[857.44s] predictions so much that he thinks real
[859.92s] GDP is going to be 1.4%. He should have
[862.24s] done 50 basis points today. So, right
[864.639s] now, it looks like he&#39;s getting away
[866.16s] with it. Everything&#39;s good. GDP is okay.
[868.399s] Earnings are okay. Employment looks
[870.56s] okay. mixed data on that front, but once
[874.639s] it starts to turn the other way, it
[876.48s] turns hard. And he has the runway right
[878.399s] now to take action. He didn&#39;t take
[879.92s] advantage of today. My sense is maybe
[882.56s] he&#39;ll get two more months to get get
[884.48s] through it. He&#39;ll announce something at
[886.399s] Jackson Hole or set the table for the
[889.12s] next cut in September. And he&#39;ll
[891.279s] probably squeak through and thread the
[893.92s] needle. Okay. A few months too late, but
[896.16s] he&#39;ll squeak through uh and it will be
[899.04s] okay. But uh there would there would
[900.959s] have been no downside of doing it today
[903.68s] other than saving taxpayers three months
[905.76s] of excessive interest on our treasury.
[908.24s] We&#39;ll certainly speak again then. In the
[910.639s] meantime, thank you Thomas Hayes. Great
[913.04s] having you. Thank you Diego. Much more
[917.44s] and we&#39;re back and then on to the uh
[922.959s] quotes of the week from Benjamin Graham.
[925.36s] The intelligent investor is a realist
[927.76s] who sells to optimists and buys from
[930.639s] pessimists. Those of you who have been
[932.0s] with me for a while know that this is
[934.959s] what we do every single week. Warren
[938.24s] Buffett, most people get interested in
[940.16s] stocks when everyone else is. The time
[942.72s] to get interested is when no one else
[945.6s] is. You can&#39;t buy what is popular and do
[949.759s] well. This is critically important,
[952.959s] ladies and gentlemen. and uh and very
[955.92s] different from, you know, I can always
[957.92s] tell from the ask me anything questions
[959.759s] each week who is new to the podcast
[962.399s] because they&#39;re asking questions about
[963.759s] the stocks that are in the headlines
[965.279s] that week and the ones that have been
[967.12s] around for one, two, three years. Uh
[969.44s] number one, they&#39;re cool as a cucumber
[970.88s] because by now they&#39;re they&#39;re wealthy
[972.72s] relative to where they were. Uh and
[975.04s] number two, they ask all the right
[976.32s] questions. So, uh I&#39;m glad to see that
[978.48s] value is getting delivered. Uh Charlie
[980.959s] Munger, great investment, great
[982.8s] investing requires a lot of delayed
[985.6s] gratification. That is the name of the
[987.839s] game, ladies and gentlemen. By the way,
[989.36s] delayed gratification also happens to be
[991.92s] very taxefficient.
[995.279s] So that&#39;s the name of the game. Let&#39;s
[997.36s] talk about some of the data here.
[1000.079s] This is a concept that I&#39;ve been focused
[1002.399s] on in some of my public appearances of
[1004.399s] late. long only funds cyclical versus
[1007.759s] defensive positioning is very low versus
[1010.959s] history. So when we think about
[1012.56s] cyclicals think consumer discretionary
[1014.639s] like the the VF corpse etc. Energy tech
[1018.56s] industrials like the Generax like the
[1021.6s] Stanley Black &amp; Deckers materials like
[1023.44s] the Albamaro tech like the Intels. We&#39;re
[1027.439s] going to talk about some developments
[1028.72s] there. Hedge funds are underweight
[1030.799s] cyclicals relative to defensives. always
[1033.039s] want to take the other side of the trade
[1035.12s] where the boat is crowded. Relative
[1037.439s] positioning at historic lows, which
[1039.76s] means we&#39;re going to see rip your face
[1042.24s] off moves uh in these baskets, which we
[1046.0s] have great exposure to. US dollar early
[1049.44s] stage secular bare market deterioration
[1051.919s] of the US government balance sheet, Fed
[1054.08s] policy, credibility and independence,
[1055.679s] new catalyst for China, Europe and Japan
[1058.48s] equities. Uh we can this has been a
[1061.039s] theme for us. We came into the year
[1063.28s] talking weak dollar. Everyone thought we
[1065.12s] were crazy. It continues to persist. Uh
[1068.72s] this is probably the most important data
[1071.2s] point of the week. And some of you are
[1074.32s] going to have a tough time understanding
[1075.679s] this one. Um uh and that&#39;s okay. Don&#39;t
[1078.96s] worry about it. I&#39;ll do my best to
[1080.96s] explain it. But what this chart is,
[1084.559s] it shows select growth and quality
[1088.32s] factors, percentage of respondents. This
[1091.28s] is the uh institutional manager survey.
[1094.4s] Percentage of respondents using return
[1096.72s] on equity edged higher in 2024. So what
[1101.44s] you can see is
[1104.4s] the quote unquote value investor of
[1108.4s] yestery year um has been forced into
[1113.039s] this new framework which basically means
[1116.48s] they&#39;ve become closet indexers and they
[1119.919s] have justified it by calling it quality
[1125.28s] uh or growth at a reasonable price and
[1127.76s] uh it&#39;s masqueraded in the concept of
[1130.96s] return on equity or more commonly return
[1133.76s] on invested capital. Now return on
[1136.4s] equity and return on invested capital
[1138.16s] are critically important variables. Um
[1141.2s] however
[1142.72s] they tend to be
[1145.6s] um emphasized
[1148.4s] more so as it relates to what they call
[1151.84s] quality or durable secular growers which
[1154.72s] in effect has been mag seven. It&#39;s just
[1156.799s] a code. It&#39;s a fancy way of saying I&#39;m
[1158.96s] not a closet indexer, but when you&#39;ll
[1160.96s] look at my book, I&#39;ve been I&#39;ve been
[1162.799s] basically bagged in the most crowded
[1164.4s] trades uh for a while. And if you look
[1167.919s] at the greatest value investors of all
[1170.4s] time, uh, that made billions in the 70s
[1173.12s] when the stock market did nothing from
[1175.28s] 1968 to 1972, whether it was Buffett or
[1178.64s] Cooperman or Gabelli, uh, kind of the
[1181.36s] value mafia I grew up with. Um,
[1185.52s] uh, no one is talking in those terms. No
[1188.32s] one is talking about the investing style
[1191.039s] of turnaround Tom that Buffett did when
[1193.6s] he was running his partnerships and shot
[1195.6s] the lights out before rolling his LPs
[1198.24s] into a permanent capital vehicle called
[1200.48s] Berkshire Hathaway. And uh what I&#39;m the
[1204.32s] point that I&#39;m making with this chart is
[1207.6s] that um and I was I was texting with a
[1210.48s] friend. I said so so these annotations
[1212.799s] are my own. The red being everyone now
[1215.12s] focused on quote unquote quality, return
[1217.039s] on equity. Uh whereas these periods in
[1221.12s] green are cyclicals value and turnaround
[1223.679s] turnaround Tom type of stuff. And um you
[1227.76s] can see the dramatic outperformance from
[1230.0s] 2001 to 2007. We&#39;ve talked about that a
[1232.4s] lot. And then in the early 90s also in
[1234.72s] the 80s and then in a big way in the
[1236.799s] 70s. As a matter of fact, you know,
[1238.32s] we&#39;ve we&#39;ve talked about it. uh value
[1240.64s] has outperformed growth uh including
[1243.28s] this aberrational zerp period by 4% and
[1247.36s] change per year since 1927 including the
[1250.72s] last 10 years when we had zero interest
[1252.24s] rate policy which means if you had
[1254.4s] invested a million dollars in 1927 in
[1257.28s] value or growth uh you would have 68
[1259.84s] million more dollars if you chose value.
[1262.96s] So what I told my friend is another way
[1264.72s] to look at it is follows. Quote, &quot;If I
[1267.52s] were looking in the rear view mirror,
[1270.48s] what would be the most important metric
[1272.4s] to be overweight?&quot; And what everyone was
[1274.159s] going to say is quality, uh, high return
[1277.36s] on equity, secular grower, aka code for
[1281.44s] mag 7, what worked yesterday. Uh, the
[1284.799s] church of what worked yesterday. Now
[1287.28s] much of the value quote unquote
[1289.36s] community is now singing from the same
[1291.52s] himnil because they&#39;ve been forced to in
[1294.559s] order to survive. Most do don&#39;t do
[1296.4s] turnarounds well. They don&#39;t understand
[1298.96s] the the the framework and the formula
[1300.799s] that works. Um so they they and the and
[1305.28s] the value traps that they had been in uh
[1307.919s] certainly didn&#39;t work. So they&#39;ve kind
[1310.0s] of moved into being growth investors
[1311.679s] without admitting it and just closet
[1313.44s] indexing. We are taking the exact
[1316.88s] opposite tact and believe those who have
[1320.48s] overweight exposure to the green
[1323.36s] cyclicals value turnarounds that are
[1325.6s] just starting to uh rock and roll
[1328.64s] following the once in aundredyear uh
[1330.72s] situation created by co uh will
[1333.679s] dramatically outperform the next 3 to 5
[1335.44s] years. Even those who take the view that
[1338.559s] capital light has changed the game. So
[1341.2s] everyone that&#39;s now chasing what worked
[1343.679s] yesterday and focused on quality secular
[1347.2s] growers, high return on invested
[1348.88s] capital, high return on equity, which
[1350.72s] over time is a good formula to have
[1352.32s] except when everyone else is doing it.
[1354.4s] Um
[1356.32s] would be advised to at least hedge that
[1360.48s] view with solid green exposure in case
[1364.0s] the historical cycle proves to be
[1367.2s] recurrent.
[1369.6s] And I say in case to be gentle when the
[1375.039s] historic recurrent cycle proves to come
[1378.32s] back. Uh and it&#39;s already started to
[1380.559s] happen this year as you saw and and
[1382.72s] which has been a core to our theme.
[1384.24s] International would outperform US,
[1385.84s] dollar would get weaker. Now you&#39;re
[1387.52s] going to start to see smalls outperform
[1389.2s] large. Uh record short interest in small
[1391.52s] caps. Cyclical turnarounds. We&#39;re
[1393.36s] already seeing these home runs. Whether
[1395.2s] it&#39;s uh QXO, which is a cyclical,
[1398.159s] whether it&#39;s uh uh Comtock Resource is a
[1401.28s] cyclical, that&#39;s almost up uh eight
[1403.84s] times four, that&#39;s almost up four bags
[1405.919s] now. Um and on and on. So, the the game
[1410.159s] is just beginning here. So, you know,
[1412.64s] you might feel like you missed it when
[1414.32s] you look at indices because all you&#39;re
[1416.24s] looking at is this, which is due to take
[1419.44s] a continued breather. And we&#39;ve talked
[1421.12s] about Max 7 trading back to the top of
[1422.88s] the range, but not more because their
[1424.32s] earnings growth is cut in half and their
[1425.919s] capex is going through the roof. Uh the
[1429.039s] fortunes are are going to continue to be
[1431.12s] made here uh for existing clients yearto
[1434.4s] date, you know what I&#39;m talking about
[1436.32s] and so on. So, leaving that aside, even
[1439.679s] if you&#39;re of the view uh chasing what
[1442.72s] everyone else is doing and calling it
[1444.96s] something else, you&#39;d be very wise if
[1447.84s] you&#39;re a large capital allocator to
[1449.84s] hedge that bet and have someone who&#39;s
[1452.88s] exceptionally skilled, which is a dying
[1454.64s] breed, by the way, in these areas right
[1456.96s] here. I would say in five years, you&#39;re
[1459.76s] going to see a huge crowd get very
[1462.48s] interested in this area, but by then all
[1464.4s] the money will be made by people like
[1466.24s] me. So, um, and you, so that&#39;s the name
[1469.36s] of the game. Uh, huge reversal in fund
[1472.72s] manager survey recession expectations in
[1474.72s] the last two months. Went from the
[1476.64s] tariffs to not the tariffs. So, this
[1478.4s] weekend, maybe Trump drops a a bunker
[1480.48s] bomb, maybe he doesn&#39;t. Market&#39;s a
[1482.32s] little jittery, but we&#39;ll get through
[1483.679s] that and we&#39;ll have an outcome by Monday
[1486.0s] for sure. Uh, FMS investors view
[1488.799s] corporate balance sheets as the best
[1490.24s] health since March of 2016. They&#39;ve
[1492.88s] delevered. That&#39;s a good thing. Just
[1494.64s] like household balance sheets had. Oh,
[1496.799s] and by the way, uh here&#39;s my beautiful
[1499.2s] hedge fund tips with Tom Hayes mug.
[1501.12s] Price is what you pay. Value is what you
[1502.88s] get. Uh thanks for everyone sending in
[1505.44s] pictures. We got a new photo. Thanks
[1507.36s] just for sending it in, but the guy sent
[1509.12s] a picture of his cat. So, I don&#39;t know
[1512.159s] if that counts, but we did post them up
[1514.0s] with some of the other photos we&#39;ve
[1515.36s] already gotten in. When you place an
[1517.36s] order, uh and I think the golf shirts
[1519.36s] are back in. Uh the t-shirts have been a
[1521.44s] big hit. obviously the hats and mugs,
[1524.159s] but um
[1527.039s] send your picture to we we have so many
[1529.76s] orders and so few pictures. So, stop
[1531.679s] being shy. If you want, just put a fake
[1534.4s] name or whatever and we&#39;ll we&#39;ll post
[1536.159s] you. But, uh we covered these last week.
[1540.4s] Uh a lot of hats and t-shirts. So this
[1542.559s] is our latest from Don G who is a cat
[1546.159s] reading the intelligent investor by Ben
[1548.0s] Graham and uh sitting next to his hedge
[1550.799s] fund tips hat. Best performing asset in
[1554.08s] the next 5 years
[1556.159s] fund manager survey says international
[1558.72s] stocks opinion follows trend. What a
[1561.44s] difference a half a year makes. Couldn&#39;t
[1564.24s] give away international when we were
[1565.52s] pounding the table. Now everyone wants
[1566.96s] it. It&#39;s just getting started ladies and
[1569.279s] gentlemen. uh asset quilt of total
[1572.08s] returns. Uh
[1574.799s] MSCI EA is up 18% year-to date. Emerging
[1579.44s] markets up 13.9%.
[1583.12s] Uh S&amp;P up only 3%. REITs up 5%.
[1587.919s] Uh global high yield cash and
[1590.08s] commodities. So that&#39;s that. We&#39;ve seen
[1593.2s] very few instances where gold is at the
[1595.44s] top of the range for more than two
[1597.36s] years. The last time that happened was
[1600.32s] uh 2010 to 2011. The next year it fell
[1604.559s] to third to the bottom. The following
[1605.919s] year after that it had the absolute
[1607.44s] worst performance. So for everyone
[1608.96s] chasing gold up here, God help you.
[1611.6s] Investors on EPS and leverage net
[1614.559s] percent of FMS investors think that
[1616.799s] global corporate profit growth will
[1619.12s] improve. That&#39;s coming off the lows, but
[1621.679s] it&#39;s at levels like you saw in COVID,
[1624.4s] like you saw in the tech wreck in 2022,
[1627.039s] and like you saw in the great financial
[1628.88s] crisis and the tech wreck of 20201.
[1632.72s] The sentiment is still subdued. Midcap
[1635.44s] ETFs accelerating in inflows. This is
[1637.76s] the theme. small and midcap starting to
[1640.0s] play
[1644.159s] just like you saw in 2001 to 2003 and
[1648.24s] then straight through outperformance to
[1651.12s] 2007. Lower financial leverage than 20
[1653.919s] thou uh 1990s and 2000s. You can look at
[1657.36s] the balance sheet here. We haven&#39;t had
[1659.84s] this low leverage since the mid80s for
[1662.24s] corporate balance sheets. Global
[1664.0s] materials still dramatically
[1665.84s] underweight. That&#39;s where Albamaro in a
[1670.48s] quasi related sense, Comtock Resources,
[1672.96s] that&#39;s why you&#39;re starting to see huge
[1674.64s] moves there. Uh, household holdings as
[1678.0s] equity of equities as a percentage of
[1679.76s] total financial assets. This is US
[1681.919s] equities, ladies and gentlemen. And
[1684.399s] honestly, we haven&#39;t had this highest
[1685.919s] percentage since &#39; 68. Um,
[1690.159s] market kind of topped out in &#39; 68 and
[1692.399s] certainly started to collapse from 72 to
[1694.64s] 74. uh 2000 and 2024. Now you have to
[1699.36s] consider that top 10 stocks is still 40%
[1703.679s] of the S&amp;P 500. So what this means is
[1706.64s] the overweight relative to everything
[1709.84s] else. Same thing in 2000 if you remember
[1712.24s] the magazine covers uh in 1999 saying
[1715.6s] has Warren Buffett lost his touch and
[1717.919s] Warren Buffett was buying Proctor and
[1719.52s] Gamble. he was buying all these
[1721.12s] defensive stocks, uh, staple stocks,
[1724.08s] boring stocks, industrial stocks at the
[1726.32s] top of the quote unquote market in 2000.
[1729.039s] And in 2001 and 2002, while the NASDAQ
[1732.559s] crashed 90, his stocks rocketed. So,
[1735.52s] you&#39;re thinking like, well, if the
[1736.72s] market crashes,
[1738.559s] um, would,
[1741.52s] you know, wouldn&#39;t everything crash? And
[1742.96s] the answer is no when you have such a
[1745.36s] concentrated period, if you are in the
[1747.52s] right things. And that&#39;s why you need to
[1748.96s] hedge out with especially if you&#39;re a
[1751.44s] large allocator with someone who is a
[1753.44s] specialist in the greens unless you
[1755.44s] think this is going to be the exception
[1758.24s] where this doesn&#39;t revert to the mean
[1759.919s] and those top 10 weights meaning 40%
[1762.159s] don&#39;t underperform for the next handful
[1764.559s] of years and our case is that they will
[1767.279s] and they have and you&#39;ve seen it year to
[1769.44s] date even though they&#39;re bouncing back
[1771.2s] in the range. We had said that they will
[1773.12s] bounce back to the top of the range and
[1775.12s] in aggregate not overtake if you take a
[1778.48s] mags versus you know one stock someone
[1780.64s] will say well what about Microsoft or
[1782.32s] what about one of these that&#39;s making
[1783.6s] new highs yeah there will be one or two
[1785.679s] but you you know you look at uh Tesla is
[1788.64s] still down Google&#39;s still down even
[1790.88s] Amazon which is probably a buy um
[1795.52s] so so you want to f to make massive
[1798.559s] amounts of money in the next two to
[1800.399s] three years you need to find what&#39;s not
[1802.64s] in these percentages that are going
[1804.64s] going to be a uh at the effect of mean
[1807.84s] reversion. Bank of America global fund
[1810.159s] manager survey investor sentiment
[1811.76s] improves slightly from May uh via
[1815.039s] bearish April level. Again, you see
[1816.96s] these levels only at the 2022 lows, the
[1819.76s] COVID lows, uh the first trade war, the
[1824.159s] EU debt crisis, great financial crisis
[1826.32s] and 9/11. So, uh, for those who think
[1828.799s] that everyone&#39;s too bullish and
[1831.039s] therefore we&#39;re going to crash, uh,
[1833.36s] they&#39;re absolutely incorrect. I I think
[1836.0s] after we get through this Iran
[1837.36s] volatility, uh, we&#39;re going to push to
[1839.44s] new highs before the end of summer,
[1841.039s] probably before the end of July.
[1842.799s] Bubbles, uh, you can see past bubbles,
[1846.32s] ARC, and Bitcoin, which is an
[1848.0s] interesting one that Bank of America
[1849.36s] points out here. uh you had uh smaller
[1853.52s] China in the late uh uh 2010s
[1858.799s] or 2000s 2007 to 2009 that is going to
[1863.36s] recur in our view uh over the next two
[1866.559s] years. There will be a final blowoff for
[1868.08s] China just like you had the final
[1869.2s] blowoff for Japan in the late 80s and
[1872.0s] we&#39;re going to benefit from that with
[1873.36s] Baba. Growth has underperformed value by
[1876.0s] 7 percentage points so far this year.
[1880.399s] Uh that was also part of the theme.
[1884.88s] Value dispersion peaks usually precede
[1887.36s] value cycles. the cycles we talked
[1889.76s] about. What&#39;s the cycle is making sure
[1892.159s] you have a manager that&#39;s expert in
[1894.159s] these areas because the cycle value
[1896.72s] cycle is just beginning. Uh and if you
[1900.48s] know what you&#39;re doing, it&#39;s like
[1903.679s] it&#39;s literally like a treasure hunt
[1905.519s] every single day. Uh value trades well
[1909.519s] below historic average versus growth.
[1911.44s] You can see here
[1915.76s] this is plus or minus two standard
[1918.48s] deviations. We&#39;re probably about halfway
[1921.2s] there. And then valuation strategies for
[1924.559s] information technology. Uh price to free
[1928.08s] cash flow outperformed the index the
[1930.72s] most over the last uh 45 40 years. And
[1934.96s] that&#39;s buying low price to free cash
[1938.48s] flow is the name of the game right now.
[1940.96s] That&#39;s not popular. That will come back
[1943.12s] very very it&#39;s already coming back. This
[1945.679s] year has been the inflection point.
[1947.6s] Large caps relative performance total
[1949.36s] return of growth versus value. You can
[1952.24s] see here this extreme not seen since
[1955.6s] 2000. And then prior to that 1980 and we
[1958.72s] know what happened next. Value
[1961.12s] dramatically outperformed. S&amp;P 500
[1964.159s] increasingly topheavy. again top 10
[1966.72s] largest S&amp;P companies as a percentage of
[1969.039s] the S&amp;P almost 40% 38% this will revert
[1973.76s] in 2000 it was 25% you&#39;ll have your
[1976.88s] people come out and say well this time
[1978.24s] it&#39;s different cap light blah blah blah
[1980.799s] I heard the same story about eyeballs in
[1984.08s] 1999 AI is certainly going to change the
[1986.799s] world just like the internet did the
[1988.32s] question is how much have you already
[1989.679s] paid for and who are going to be the
[1991.519s] winners and if you think you exactly
[1993.2s] know uh it&#39;s what you don&#39;t know that
[1995.44s] you don&#39;t know uh
[1998.24s] that that can hurt you and no one knows
[2000.48s] and that that&#39;s really what it comes
[2001.84s] down to. So you want to buy the
[2003.76s] beneficiaries that are beaten down that
[2005.6s] are going to benefit from all this while
[2007.2s] all the innovators get flushed out in
[2009.519s] the early cycle of changing the world
[2011.76s] which happens every single cycle. Short
[2013.679s] interest has risen in 2025 that creates
[2016.24s] the next buyers which is why I&#39;m been
[2018.159s] pushing we&#39;re going to new highs before
[2019.919s] the end of summer. FMS investors are net
[2022.96s] 38% underweight US equities, the most
[2026.72s] since May of 2023. This has hockey stick
[2030.32s] since the beginning of the year. We
[2031.84s] called this on the podcast aggressively
[2033.76s] in the fourth quarter of last year. Go
[2035.6s] back and look at the tapes. More
[2037.279s] downside for dollar expected. Opinion
[2039.279s] follows trend. That&#39;s from Bloomberg.
[2041.2s] Economists raise China growth exports
[2043.519s] outlook for 2025.
[2045.919s] composition of the $81 trillion global
[2049.599s] equity market. You can see here US is
[2052.639s] 64%.
[2054.159s] The earnings power is nowhere near that
[2056.96s] percentage of the overall equity pie and
[2059.52s] that will revert and we&#39;ve seen the
[2061.359s] beginnings of that this year. Long
[2065.359s] emerging markets again one standard
[2067.599s] deviation below the means. Uh, and the
[2070.879s] last times you got to this was 20201,
[2074.079s] which was you never made more money in a
[2076.079s] shorter period of time than being long
[2077.52s] emerging markets, small caps in value
[2080.0s] from 2001 to 2007. Everything&#39;s pointing
[2082.639s] to the same thing. Very similar. Why did
[2085.04s] you see a lot of these managers make
[2086.72s] billions in the 70s when the stock
[2088.399s] market did nothing? Small caps
[2090.079s] outperformed. It was a stock picker
[2091.679s] paradise. Same thing&#39;s going to happen
[2093.44s] now. Um and by the way, same thing in
[2096.159s] the second um term of uh Reagan uh in
[2100.88s] the late 80s from 85 to 90 and early
[2104.4s] part of Bush one. Target rate
[2107.359s] probabilities for September 17th meeting
[2110.32s] up to 64% now. first cut. We covered
[2112.8s] that on Vney AI. Bulls minus bears.
[2116.96s] Again, not at extreme. We push higher,
[2118.96s] ladies and gentlemen. Uh 6 months later
[2122.0s] on average 10%, one year later, 21%. S&amp;P
[2126.079s] 500, you can see here, making an
[2127.76s] aggressive what they call a cup and
[2129.839s] handle. Measured move would imply 4900
[2133.76s] to 6,000 is,00 measured move would imply
[2136.32s] 7,100 probably by sometime in 2026.
[2142.64s] Yet another sign this is a bull market.
[2144.64s] Uh after 2 months of gains in the S&amp;P of
[2147.2s] 20% or more 1950 to today, one year out
[2150.4s] on average up 30%, 6 months out on
[2153.04s] average 16%. Economists expect Germany
[2155.76s] to grow again this year. that is from
[2158.64s] negative earnings growth to positive
[2160.16s] earnings growth starting this year and
[2162.16s] reacelerating 2026 2027. That helps the
[2165.2s] European theme that helps our GXO
[2168.24s] position which we talked about with
[2169.839s] Stew. Uh by the way, I got some
[2171.92s] incredible news. I&#39;m going to just skip
[2173.2s] to it right now. uh literally it must
[2175.599s] have been either while I was talking to
[2177.68s] Vney
[2179.28s] uh or shortly thereafter
[2182.8s] GXO announces completion of the UK
[2185.68s] regulatory review of Winkitin
[2187.839s] acquisition and raises full year 2025
[2192.0s] guidance. So this is what I said as one
[2194.16s] of the two catalyst for GXO to get to 60
[2196.72s] before the end of the year and probably
[2198.0s] more by the way. uh largest pure play
[2200.48s] contract logistics provider announced
[2202.0s] that the UK competition markets CMA has
[2204.56s] cleared GXO&#39;s acquisition of Winkitin
[2207.2s] subject to the devestment of a small
[2209.04s] number of Wikington grocery contracts in
[2210.8s] the UK which is less than probably less
[2213.04s] than 3% of total revenues of Winkitin uh
[2215.76s] and that invest integration will be
[2217.68s] permitted with the vast majority of the
[2219.359s] Winkutin business once certain
[2221.04s] administrative conditions are met. The
[2222.8s] company also announced today that it is
[2225.119s] raising fullear guidance on organic
[2227.44s] revenue growth, adjusted IBIDA and
[2229.04s] adjusted diluted EPS.
[2231.92s] We are pleased with the regulatory
[2233.52s] review. Excited to bring the two
[2235.599s] businesses together combination offering
[2238.32s] uh customers across the UK, Ireland
[2240.48s] bring presence in strategic verticals
[2242.0s] that will serve as a springboard for
[2243.2s] growth. Well positioned to move forward
[2244.72s] swiftly and look forward to welcoming
[2246.4s] the Winkington team to GXO. updated
[2250.32s] fullear guidance organic revenue growth.
[2252.96s] Uh the midpoint was brought up to
[2256.72s] 5% from 4 a.5% organic revenue growth.
[2261.52s] IBIDA midpoint
[2263.599s] uh from 850 to 870. So 20 more million
[2267.839s] of adjusted IBIDA. EPS
[2270.88s] midpoint 253 from 250 and uh free cash
[2276.4s] flow conversion to 30% mid-range. So all
[2280.4s] of this super exciting news. Pretty
[2282.72s] timely for that interview this morning.
[2284.72s] Uh better to be lucky than to be good
[2286.72s] sometimes. So uh earnings of MCI China
[2290.16s] continue to uh shoot upward. compound
[2294.0s] annual growth rate over the next seven
[2296.0s] years expected to be uh let&#39;s see here
[2300.56s] what are we talking about somewhere
[2303.04s] around 9 10%
[2305.839s] US uh with the implication being
[2310.88s] the value intrinsic value of the
[2312.64s] businesses off of normalized value
[2315.52s] multiples would be double off of
[2318.0s] depressed multiples will probably be
[2320.24s] quadruple FYI so Um,
[2324.72s] Goldman holdings in Chinese equities as
[2326.96s] a percentage of total AUM is uh 1.6%
[2332.32s] the benchmark is 5% managers are 3.4%
[2336.24s] underweight Chinese equities. The
[2337.839s] catch-up is going to be violent violent
[2341.28s] to the upside if you don&#39;t have it. Uh,
[2344.4s] can&#39;t help you. An overlooked boom in
[2346.56s] China. 15 major economies with the
[2348.72s] highest growth rate of household
[2350.32s] spending in this century. Uh that game
[2352.96s] is back on. We&#39;re going to cover a
[2354.16s] couple of things about that. China&#39;s
[2355.44s] consumption gets a boost from tradein
[2358.64s] subsidies, household appliances and
[2360.96s] video equipment, furniture,
[2362.56s] communication appliance, automobiles,
[2364.079s] retail sales. This is called Alibaba is
[2367.359s] the toll taker. 40 cents of every retail
[2369.839s] dollar spent on e-commerce goes through
[2372.32s] Taoba T- Mall. Uh the government has
[2375.52s] committed to 70% internal consumption.
[2379.44s] uh and Baba is best positioned to take
[2381.599s] advantage of that. Particularly the
[2382.8s] middle class Timu and that garbage PDD
[2386.4s] got uh a share of the pie when people
[2388.8s] were poor during COVID and bought
[2390.64s] garbage. Now that the middle class is
[2392.64s] reemerging and getting their confidence
[2394.32s] back, Taoba Teeal controls the middle
[2398.32s] class spend and is the preeminent toll
[2402.56s] taker. International stock seen as the
[2404.8s] best asset class over the next five
[2406.48s] years. uh opinion follows trend. It&#39;s
[2409.119s] amazing when you have 15 percentage of
[2411.04s] outperformance.
[2416.4s] Goldman Sachs top down S&amp;P 500 forecast
[2419.359s] 12 months out 6500.
[2422.96s] So that&#39;s opinion follows trend. They
[2424.8s] went down when the market went down. Now
[2426.24s] they&#39;re back up. They blow like a you
[2428.4s] know in California now I understand
[2430.16s] blowing like like the wind like a palm
[2432.4s] tree in the wind. Uh that&#39;s most of the
[2434.8s] sell side earnings growth. And by the
[2437.76s] way, that&#39;s why they keep their jobs. If
[2439.839s] they were like an oak tree, uh and they
[2442.079s] and they fought the wind, they would
[2443.359s] snap. Uh these guys blow with the wind.
[2445.52s] So like a palm tree, they always bounce
[2447.359s] back and keep their jobs. uh earnings
[2449.839s] growth
[2451.839s] proform earnings uh year-over-year.
[2456.16s] You can see
[2459.119s] uh unmagnificent 493 accelerating mag 7
[2462.079s] collapsing. That&#39;s not new. We&#39;ve
[2464.16s] covered that almost every week. China
[2466.16s] retail sales year reacelerating like we
[2469.28s] haven&#39;t seen since 2022 and prior to
[2472.24s] that uh 2020 when all the equities were
[2475.839s] off the charts. game is just beginning.
[2478.96s] Retail flows have recently been stronger
[2480.88s] than average
[2483.119s] and they&#39;ve been right. Okay, by the
[2485.119s] way, they were uh
[2488.079s] buying the dip in COVID uh international
[2491.2s] relative to the rest of the world stocks
[2493.119s] since 1950. So, you can see here this
[2495.359s] concentration that&#39;s going to get
[2496.64s] smacked already has this year. It&#39;s
[2498.48s] going to continue to get smacked when
[2500.079s] you have this concentration like you saw
[2502.0s] in 2019. And most people don&#39;t know that
[2505.119s] they&#39;re still stuck in this and they&#39;re
[2506.96s] all on one side of the boat about to get
[2508.64s] drowned um because they think they own
[2511.2s] 500 stocks and they don&#39;t understand
[2513.44s] what a cap weight it is index is
[2515.92s] relative to an equal weight uh relative
[2518.96s] to exposure to a manager that
[2521.92s] specializes in the green area which is
[2524.079s] looking through the windshield versus
[2525.68s] the rear view mirror. Median twoe S&amp;P
[2528.4s] 500 return since 1950.
[2532.56s] uh second half of June. Okay. Tends to
[2535.44s] be weak. We&#39;ll see what happens. GS
[2538.56s] social I I I think we pulled forward a
[2540.4s] lot of the weakness that was supposed to
[2542.16s] happen in June and got it in um April
[2546.72s] and May, but let&#39;s see. GS social media
[2549.359s] economic sentiment index
[2553.2s] starting to move back up. FMS most
[2556.24s] underweight the US dollar in 20 years.
[2558.88s] This goes all the way back to the early
[2560.8s] 2000s, which was when what happened?
[2562.64s] International outperformed, value
[2564.0s] outperformed, small caps outperformed.
[2566.079s] What do you know? Retail investors have
[2567.839s] been selling in
[2570.24s] the last three weeks.
[2572.72s] Uh, every single consistent. Okay. Well,
[2576.96s] it&#39;s something to keep an eye on.
[2578.319s] Household allocation to US equities
[2580.079s] across global regions.
[2582.72s] US has the most concentration, which
[2585.04s] means they&#39;re overweight. those seven
[2586.56s] stocks, which by the way, the carry
[2588.88s] trade continues to unwind. We&#39;ve warned
[2590.56s] you about that. And all that hot money
[2592.56s] is coming out of those seven stocks.
[2595.359s] Underweight China, that will play
[2596.88s] catchup. More opinion follows trend.
[2599.92s] Stock market around breath thrust, which
[2603.52s] we just had
[2605.76s] 12 months later
[2609.68s] on average up 15.5%. So basically, here
[2614.56s] we are. Here&#39;s where we have to go after
[2617.119s] this
[2618.72s] level of breath thrust for the
[2620.16s] technicians out there. Investor
[2621.52s] allocation to equities at an all-time
[2623.359s] high which basically means still mag
[2625.44s] seven because of the waitings even
[2626.96s] though the earnings growth is collapsing
[2629.28s] in those kind of call it 10 names
[2633.04s] central underweight debt which is going
[2634.96s] to change now the demand for treasuries
[2637.44s] is going up. Uh Bowen and Bessant are
[2640.96s] going to get the uh SLR intact probably
[2644.24s] in coming weeks. The Genius Act was
[2646.64s] passed yesterday that&#39;ll create another
[2648.24s] trillion dollars of demand to two
[2649.92s] trillion of demand of treasuries over
[2651.68s] the next two years. Uh the game is on
[2654.8s] and then uh Trump will probably start to
[2657.52s] appoint or announce uh trial balloon
[2660.64s] names of new Fed chair. So that will act
[2663.839s] as what we call a shadow Fed chair. So
[2667.76s] Powell has effectively made himself a
[2670.0s] lame duck uh for the remainder of his
[2672.48s] term once Trump starts to announce a you
[2675.28s] know very throw very dovish names out
[2677.76s] there. The market will start to discount
[2680.48s] 100 to 200 basis points of immediate
[2682.72s] cuts uh that will come into play May of
[2685.76s] 2026. It&#39;ll start to discount it uh the
[2688.72s] third or fourth quarter of this year. So
[2691.52s] be on the lookout for that. central bank
[2694.24s] cuts at fastest pace in 2025 last month.
[2698.319s] Everyone except for Powell. Too late
[2700.16s] Powell. Um
[2702.72s] and that&#39;s that. He&#39;ll he&#39;ll he&#39;ll get
[2705.28s] away with it. He&#39;ll set the table in in
[2707.839s] Jackson Hole. He&#39;ll do the first cut in
[2710.8s] September and probably second in
[2712.56s] December and then he will be off to play
[2716.16s] congressional five days a week. I hear
[2718.0s] he&#39;s a pretty good golfer by the way. Um
[2721.28s] S&amp;P price to sales over time. Again,
[2724.0s] this is skewed by those 10 names. Decade
[2726.16s] worth of volatility in the 2020s.
[2729.599s] Uh that&#39;s interesting.
[2732.4s] Wow. More volat almost double the
[2734.079s] volatility of the 70s. The stories I
[2735.92s] heard about the 70s. That&#39;s pretty wild.
[2737.68s] Consumer balance sheet
[2740.48s] very healthy.
[2746.64s] $190 trillion of assets, $20 trillion of
[2749.599s] liabilities.
[2751.52s] That&#39;s pretty damn healthy. Fed call as
[2754.88s] of 610 2025. There&#39;s a lot of room to
[2757.119s] lever up once they get the rates under
[2758.64s] control. Powell&#39;s just kind of delaying
[2761.28s] things, but it is what it is. Fed call
[2763.839s] as of 610. That&#39;s immaterial.
[2768.48s] Results for buying S&amp;P on the last day
[2771.44s] of loss exceeds 12%. No one cares.
[2774.64s] cumulative retail sales
[2783.44s] January through May.
[2786.64s] Total short interest ticking up.
[2789.52s] So, last time we saw short interest get
[2791.44s] this high was like the the whole in 2016
[2794.72s] and you had a monster rally
[2797.599s] the next couple of years.
[2800.16s] Um,
[2801.76s] you know, these guys are forced buyers.
[2803.599s] this amount of short interest the whole
[2805.44s] way up from 2020 from 2022 higher. They
[2808.64s] just kept shorting and shorting
[2809.68s] shorting. So now they&#39;re going to be
[2811.119s] forced buyers as this thing pushes to
[2812.72s] new highs.
[2817.28s] Huge move
[2820.48s] into Euro zone and emerging markets out
[2822.8s] of US and US dollar. We&#39;ve been calling
[2825.28s] for that for a while.
[2827.52s] into the euro, into healthcare, by the
[2829.599s] way, into industrials, slowly out of
[2832.56s] tech, out of Japan,
[2835.119s] uh, out of the US dollar. Record high
[2838.72s] foreign ownership of the US stock market
[2841.28s] that&#39;s starting to decline, underweight
[2844.4s] energy, we see it in the comm stocks,
[2848.56s] Christmas in July, NASDAQ&#39;s 12-day
[2851.04s] midyear rally. So markets tend to have a
[2853.2s] massive rally in the first 12 trading
[2855.839s] days of July. You do not want to get
[2858.96s] short ahead of that. If you want to
[2861.04s] lighten up, do so after alltime highs
[2863.2s] sometime in August. But basically, it
[2865.68s] just grinds sideways till the end of
[2867.119s] year rally or net. Uh Russell 1000
[2870.319s] versus Russell 2000.
[2874.079s] This is large cap versus small cap. This
[2877.2s] is going to mean revert like nobody&#39;s
[2879.599s] business. We have not been at this level
[2881.04s] of an extreme since 2001. Hold on to
[2884.8s] your seat belts. If you don&#39;t have small
[2886.079s] cap exposure, just, you know, look, all
[2888.4s] this is opinion, not advice, but at
[2890.0s] least get yourself uh an ETF if you
[2892.88s] don&#39;t have a manager who can pick the
[2894.16s] best stocks for you. Um, so click on
[2897.52s] terms here, opinion, not advice. Talk to
[2899.359s] your financial adviser be before doing
[2901.04s] anything. Speaking of which, we are
[2903.04s] going to be opening up again for Q3

[2909.52s] million and above. So, those of you who
[2912.319s] are interested in getting in queue for
[2915.359s] that and having a conversation so you
[2917.2s] can be ready to go Jy

[2923.2s] click on money management, uh and we&#39;ll
[2925.92s] have a chat. This is uh not a
[2927.68s] solicitation. All this is opinion, not
[2929.52s] advice. Do whatever you want. Check with
[2931.28s] your financial advisor first. Uh
[2934.0s] Bloomberg trade policy index
[2938.4s] S&amp;P year to date trade policy
[2940.079s] uncertainty. So that&#39;s that&#39;s getting
[2941.599s] more certain.
[2947.52s] Companies that reduce shares at low
[2949.68s] valuations tend to outperform annualized
[2952.319s] performance 1986 to 2025.
[2955.68s] Uh the per the the greatest example of
[2958.8s] this under the sun is what Alibaba did
[2962.8s] buying back stock between $60 and $80. I
[2965.76s] mean they couldn&#39;t have done any better.
[2968.64s] I&#39;d say another one that did a good job
[2970.48s] was 10 cent. It&#39;s amazing these Chinese
[2972.72s] companies, they were smart enough to
[2974.559s] have cash reserves and they were twice
[2977.359s] as smart to deploy them in the hole when
[2980.319s] everyone was ducked under the desk. And
[2983.2s] uh you know now these stocks are up 100%
[2985.599s] and not even starting to move yet.
[2988.16s] They&#39;re the the beginning of their moves
[2989.76s] is just now. Um but they did the exact
[2992.559s] right thing. You rarely see that with US
[2994.16s] managers. What you see with US managers
[2996.559s] unfortunately is after the stock has had
[2998.8s] you know a huge run 4x 5x they start
[3001.92s] buying back stocks so they can sell
[3003.76s] their ESOP plans into the liquidity
[3006.88s] created by the company which is you know
[3008.8s] a crime.
[3011.04s] It&#39;s it&#39;s not a literal crime. It&#39;s a
[3012.96s] figurative crime and it&#39;s ripping you
[3014.64s] off as as owners. But uh it is what it
[3017.28s] is. Companies that reduce shares at low.
[3019.359s] Okay. Valuation matters. It didn&#39;t it
[3022.64s] just didn&#39;t for the 2010s. Uh so if you
[3025.839s] go back IBIDA enterprise value
[3030.079s] dramatically outperform from 86 to 2006.
[3032.8s] We&#39;ve been through this
[3040.319s] and that&#39;s that on the data front. So, a
[3042.64s] lot of great stuff there. Some
[3044.079s] headlines,
[3045.839s] China&#39;s May retail sales grow at fastest
[3050.319s] pace since December 2023 as subsidies
[3053.76s] help boost consumption. Alibaba, how you
[3056.64s] doing? So, let me repeat that. China&#39;s
[3059.2s] May retail sales grow at fastest pace
[3061.04s] since December 2023. Um,
[3064.8s] retail sales jumped 6.4% from a year
[3068.0s] earlier, sharply beating analyst
[3070.319s] estimates for 5% growth and accelerating
[3072.4s] from the 5.1. What they underestimate is
[3074.96s] the the ability of a basically unelected
[3078.8s] official uh who has unlimited runway to
[3083.04s] affect policy change quickly and
[3086.4s] massively which you can&#39;t do in a
[3088.96s] democracy where people get voted out of
[3090.72s] office every two years. So, so when they
[3093.76s] said they are driving internal
[3095.28s] consumption, believe them. And then all
[3097.839s] you have to do is reverse engineer who&#39;s
[3099.44s] going to be the biggest beneficiary and
[3101.44s] it&#39;s unquestionably Alibaba. So that&#39;s
[3104.4s] the name of the game just beginning.
[3106.559s] China to loosen IPO restrictions by
[3108.559s] reinstating listings of unprofitable
[3110.24s] startups. That&#39;s the CSRC. More IPOs
[3113.04s] game on. Beijing&#39;s reform could bring
[3115.119s] Hong Kong listed Alibaba and 10-centent
[3117.44s] to the Shenzhen exchange. So Stock
[3120.4s] Connect plus Shenzen. Lots and lots of
[3122.88s] pentup buyers. China eases doubts on
[3124.96s] consumer subsidies with funding
[3126.319s] assurance. Alibaba movie units pivot
[3129.52s] rebrand bring $2 billion of value gain,
[3132.0s] i.e. not priced into the stock either.
[3134.319s] Alibaba updates open source quen 3
[3136.48s] models to support AI deployment on Apple
[3139.76s] devices. QXO offers to buy building
[3142.88s] materials firm GMS for 5 billion. I&#39;m
[3145.599s] telling you ladies and gentlemen, do not
[3148.0s] sleep on QXO. I know it&#39;s up some 70s
[3151.839s] something% since we put it out. I think
[3154.559s] we&#39;ve got $1310 or whatever. Um
[3160.48s] it&#39;s probably going to take a breather
[3161.92s] at some point because it&#39;s up so much in
[3164.0s] such a short period of time. But you
[3165.52s] look a handful of years out, this is uh
[3168.24s] you know somewhere between 80 and 100
[3170.0s] and probably more. So um that one you
[3173.119s] know some of them take longer, some of
[3174.48s] them happen quicker. That one was
[3175.839s] happened quicker than expected. Uh, the
[3177.92s] housing market is finally buyer friendly
[3179.839s] as more sellers slash prices. Here&#39;s
[3181.52s] where you can find a deal.
[3184.48s] Uh, Senate passes stable coin bill in
[3187.04s] the big win for crypto industry. That&#39;s
[3188.96s] going to create two trillion in demand
[3190.8s] for treasuries,
[3193.599s] compressed yields. PayPal is the sixth
[3196.64s] largest issuer of stable coins. That
[3198.8s] will help them. A lot of great stuff
[3201.2s] happening. Stable coins market cap
[3202.559s] surges to record high as US Senate bill
[3204.88s] passes bill. Fed announced its meeting
[3206.96s] to discuss easing bank leverage rules.
[3209.599s] This is what I talked about with the SLR
[3212.079s] with uh Bowman. When is that meeting?
[3215.44s] June 25th.
[3218.48s] So the game is on ladies and gentlemen.
[3220.88s] Fed officials hold rates again. Still
[3223.28s] see two cuts before year end. According
[3225.2s] to the summary of economic projections
[3227.44s] and sharp pal&#39;s predictions,
[3230.24s] dollar slump is the worst since 1980s.
[3232.48s] Don&#39;t expect a quick rebound. that&#39;s
[3234.48s] from Baronss. US exceptionalism in
[3237.2s] markets is diminished but far from dead.
[3239.92s] And I think that&#39;s the key thing um is
[3243.28s] in markets. It&#39;s just a reversion. It
[3246.24s] means nothing about our exceptionalism
[3248.079s] as a nation. We are the best. We&#39;re
[3250.079s] going to continue to be the best because
[3251.599s] we get the best from everywhere in the
[3253.04s] world. It is a melting pot of the best
[3254.72s] ideas and the best people from all over
[3256.88s] the world in one place. By the way, if
[3259.28s] that&#39;s true, that they sold 70,000 of
[3261.76s] the $5 million passports, that is
[3264.0s] insanity. 300 something billion dollars
[3267.2s] uh into the Treasury with rich people
[3269.28s] that&#39;ll create jobs. Uh and um you know,
[3274.079s] we&#39;re we&#39;re going to I I like the fact
[3276.0s] that Trump backed off on the people who
[3278.319s] have been working here for a while. uh
[3280.559s] is key because uh you know
[3285.2s] I we might we need immigrants. There&#39;s
[3288.8s] no question. We need immigrants. Let&#39;s
[3290.319s] find a way to fasttrack it so more
[3292.88s] people can come in at all levels, not
[3294.64s] just at $5 million, but poor, hungry,
[3297.2s] honest people that want to work hard. Uh
[3300.0s] we should be letting in by the boatload,
[3301.599s] not just people with $5 million checks.
[3303.839s] Uh but they&#39;ve got to be legal and
[3305.599s] they&#39;ve got to be vetted and um maybe
[3308.16s] there&#39;s some common ground in the middle
[3310.96s] of the road where uh we can do that and
[3313.359s] maybe some penalty for people who&#39;ve
[3314.72s] been here illegally but that are
[3316.24s] hardworking noncriminals uh pay some
[3319.04s] type of uh upfront tax uh and then you
[3322.72s] know get to stay or something. But
[3324.16s] anyway, that&#39;s all political stuff. We
[3325.76s] need population growth to continue our
[3328.4s] hegemony and uh we will we will get it.
[3331.76s] Intel brings new engineering leaders to
[3334.079s] help AI come back. This is really wild.
[3336.72s] You saw the stock up yesterday.
[3339.44s] Shinyas, Shiny Vasan,
[3343.119s] Jean Ddier, Aligruchi and Shalendra
[3347.52s] Desai. Okay, none of these three are
[3349.92s] Irishmen. Okay, we need immigrants.
[3354.0s] Said the halfirishman. So um you know
[3357.76s] Lip Bhutan is tapping veterans of
[3360.64s] Cadence Design Systems. You know the
[3362.48s] story with Cadence
[3365.119s] superund
[3367.04s] something bag or whatever it was when he
[3368.64s] ran it. Apple and Google uh all these
[3372.4s] guys have huge chip development
[3374.48s] experience. This this is going to be the
[3376.319s] biggest shock.
[3378.24s] Um energy stocks have had a mixed start
[3380.48s] to 2025. Natural gas is hot and oil is
[3383.359s] not. We agree, which is why we&#39;ve sat on
[3385.839s] our hands uh on the oil and uh just gone
[3389.52s] crazy on the By the way, range
[3395.92s] this week. Um
[3399.04s] range resources,
[3401.2s] there&#39;s one that took longer, but again,
[3403.68s] if you&#39;re patient with these things, I
[3405.92s] think I&#39;ve told the story. Um we bought
[3408.48s] it at $11 in 2018. It immediately shot
[3413.119s] up to we we determined intrinsic value
[3415.28s] was around 60 approved and unapproved
[3417.359s] reserves. Uh immediately shot to 18. We
[3419.76s] thought we were geniuses. COVID came, it
[3421.68s] shot down to a$110
[3424.319s] uh or something like that. We br we
[3426.319s] backed up the truck, bought as much as
[3428.72s] we could possibly get, brought our bases
[3430.559s] down to 410. Uh I think it got to over
[3433.52s] 41. So it&#39;s a 10 bagger in seven years.
[3438.4s] Okay. So the first three years it was a
[3442.319s] bad quote unquote if you&#39;re early you&#39;re
[3444.559s] wrong bad investment that&#39;s just the
[3446.72s] stupidest nonsense from people who don&#39;t
[3448.4s] do fundamental research. Um
[3452.64s] and now it&#39;s you know now it&#39;s a
[3453.92s] 10bagger and then you got the comm stock
[3456.0s] which is already almost a four bagger.
[3458.24s] Uh so if if if
[3461.04s] you do if you know what you own sooner
[3464.24s] or later in the in the short term the
[3466.64s] market is a voting machine based on
[3468.72s] emotion. In the long term it&#39;s a
[3470.319s] weighing machine based on fundamentals.
[3472.64s] If you master understanding knowing what
[3475.44s] you own in the fundamentals like we
[3476.96s] cover here every week uh and you&#39;re
[3479.119s] patient and you don&#39;t run on leverage uh
[3481.76s] or any material leverage, there&#39;s
[3484.319s] nothing you can&#39;t accomplish is really
[3485.839s] what it comes down to. Trend followers
[3487.92s] stumble into one of their worst years
[3489.44s] ever. Uh, world&#39;s smallest violin.
[3492.64s] Global EV sales rise in May as China
[3495.52s] hits 2025 peak row motion. Uh, that&#39;s
[3499.599s] going to help our Albamaro.
[3503.04s] And then speaking of which, it plays out
[3504.96s] in cycle stock market and sentiment
[3506.64s] results. Bank of America fund manager
[3509.359s] survey update. We put the summary out on
[3511.68s] Tuesday. 22 222 managers running 587
[3516.48s] billion AUM. Here are the top five
[3518.319s] points. Opinion follows trend. 54% of
[3521.2s] managers now expect international stocks
[3522.88s] to be the best performing over the next
[3524.4s] 5 years. You couldn&#39;t give away an
[3526.0s] international stock in Q4 when we were
[3527.68s] pounding the table. Managers are now the
[3529.839s] most underweight. The US dollar uh
[3532.319s] they&#39;ve been since 20 years. What was
[3533.76s] the narrative last year? King dollar.
[3535.839s] Materials and energy remain unloved with
[3538.0s] managers net 26% underweight. energy up
[3541.04s] from last month&#39;s record low allocation
[3542.559s] and 15% underweight materials. Uh
[3545.28s] there&#39;s your com stock and Albamaro just
[3547.52s] getting started. Four of the doomsday
[3549.76s] recession expectations we saw in April
[3551.52s] have collapsed, reversing from 42% of
[3553.44s] managers saying global recession was
[3555.119s] likely to now a net 36% saying it is
[3558.48s] unlikely. Trapped bears continue to fuel
[3560.319s] the pain trade to the upside. And five
[3562.799s] managers are 28% net overweight emerging
[3565.68s] market equities. How you like that? 28%
[3568.88s] overweight emerging market equities, up
[3571.04s] from last month&#39;s net 11% and the
[3573.119s] highest allocation since August 2023.
[3576.16s] Here&#39;s Albamaro. Each week we try to
[3578.0s] cover one to two companies we&#39;ve
[3579.28s] discussed in previous podcast vidcast uh
[3582.16s] and or own for clients including
[3584.24s] personally.
[3585.92s] So you can see here free cash flows
[3588.16s] recovering but still lagging prices
[3590.72s] doing exactly what it should based on
[3592.48s] that. Our favorite theme heading into
[3594.48s] 2025 was the last shall be first with
[3596.079s] healthcare and materials as our top two
[3597.52s] sectors. Both had been left for dead
[3599.2s] after posting anemic returns in 2024,
[3601.44s] but earnings for the two were expected
[3603.359s] to recover handsomely in 2025.
[3605.119s] Healthcare was projected to grow by
[3606.559s] 20.7, materials by 18.9, both ranking
[3608.88s] among top four overall sectors. Six
[3611.119s] months into the year, healthcare has
[3612.559s] largely held up, now projected to
[3614.079s] deliver 14.5% earnings growth and rank
[3616.64s] third overall. Materials stumbled out of
[3618.319s] the gates partially on the tariffs. uh
[3621.04s] took it on the chin from tariffs with
[3622.72s] earnings growth now expected to be 7.8%.
[3625.839s] Uh but as they say, being too early is
[3627.839s] indistinguish from being wrong. Uh
[3630.559s] that&#39;s exactly how this one has played
[3633.119s] out so far with the materials recovery
[3634.88s] looking more like a 2026 story. Uh and
[3638.319s] if we zoom out, the delay in the
[3640.24s] recovery could end up being more like a
[3641.68s] blessing in disguise. That&#39;s because our
[3643.2s] number one pick for the theme is
[3645.52s] Albamaro, a position that at the time
[3647.92s] wasn&#39;t large enough yet because the
[3649.28s] price had run away from us. We don&#39;t buy
[3651.119s] up and we&#39;re hoping to get a second bite
[3653.28s] at the apple. Luckily, we&#39;ve gotten the
[3654.88s] opportunity served on a silver platter
[3656.559s] to size in accordingly. Albamaro is the
[3658.799s] world&#39;s largest and lowest cost lithium
[3660.72s] producer. The roller coaster story of
[3662.079s] lithium over the past 5 years goes
[3664.16s] something like this. Demand went through
[3665.44s] the roof in 2021 and through 2022 as the
[3668.559s] EV and renewables boom took off in full
[3670.96s] force. Automakers were scaling
[3672.96s] production and stockpile on lithium. All
[3674.72s] while supply was heavily constrained
[3676.319s] from years of underinvestment and
[3677.76s] logistical bottlenecks. This perfect
[3679.28s] storm sent prices up more than eight 8x,
[3682.079s] reaching all-time highs of north of
[3683.839s] 80,000 per metric ton. And Albamaro was
[3686.24s] minting more cash than they knew what to
[3687.92s] do with. But the high prices quickly
[3689.76s] brought a wave of new supply. Small-cale
[3691.599s] producers in China, many fully
[3694.24s] subsidized, flooded the market and
[3696.0s] created massive supply glut. Lithium
[3698.079s] prices came crashing down. uh and
[3700.48s] Albamaro&#39;s stock fell with them down
[3702.4s] more than 80% to where it is today.
[3706.24s] The good news for Albamaro is that as we
[3708.24s] mentioned they are the largest and
[3709.44s] lowest cost producer worldwide. This has
[3711.2s] allowed them to cut operating costs in
[3712.72s] capex and pretty much sit on their hands
[3714.559s] and wait for cycllically low lithium
[3716.319s] prices to recover. Meanwhile, the longer
[3718.4s] prices stay in the pain zone, the more
[3720.24s] lowquality marginal producers will get
[3722.319s] taken out on a stretcher. To put this
[3724.64s] into context, Albamaro Management
[3726.559s] estimates that 40% of global current
[3729.28s] lithium capacity is at or below break
[3731.76s] even only with onethird of that supply
[3733.76s] having come on coming off having come
[3737.2s] offline so far. This should continue to
[3739.119s] support Albamaro and lithium prices from
[3741.52s] the supply side with analysts expecting
[3743.52s] the supply glut to shrink and largely be
[3745.76s] gone by 2026.
[3751.76s] So with supply starting to dry up and
[3754.72s] marginal producers coming offline, this
[3756.4s] the focus now shifts to the other side
[3758.079s] of the equation, demand. And what
[3759.68s] becomes immediately clear is that demand
[3761.44s] has never been the issue for lithium. It
[3763.599s] has gone up and to the right with no
[3765.119s] signs of slowing with consensus still
[3766.72s] calling for 15 to 20% kagger over the
[3768.88s] next decade. Meanwhile, all the noise
[3771.2s] about slowing EV growth in North America
[3773.04s] still up 17% yearonear has created a
[3775.44s] catharsis among investors. That but that
[3778.16s] completely misses the point. The reality
[3780.96s] is that North America accounts for just
[3782.72s] 10% of global EV sales. The real story
[3784.88s] is China, which makes up more than 60%
[3787.68s] of the market. It&#39;s a government
[3789.28s] subsidized market, and the government
[3791.119s] will not stop when it has its mind set
[3792.96s] on something, and just posted a 41%
[3795.599s] growth in the first quarter. Meanwhile,
[3797.76s] while everyone stays focused on the EV
[3799.28s] narrative, they are missing what may be
[3800.88s] the biggest shift happening under the
[3802.4s] surface. Data centers and stationary
[3804.799s] storage. Just a few years ago, this
[3806.799s] segment was expected to make up around
[3808.4s] 5% of total lithium demand. Today,
[3810.64s] projections are closer to 30%. Few weeks
[3813.28s] ago, Ken Hoffman, shout out by the way
[3815.52s] to Brad K, uh client in OC, an ex uh um
[3821.039s] who sent me this. Uh Ken Hoffman is an
[3823.359s] expert in lithium and battery materials,
[3826.079s] formerly at McKenzie, laid out the case
[3827.599s] for a lithium recovery. He sees the
[3829.119s] bottom in 2025 and a gradual recovery
[3830.96s] starting in 2026. prices reaching 15 to
[3833.52s] 20,000 per metric ton by year end. While
[3836.64s] the market obsesses over the temporary
[3838.4s] supply glut, Hoffman&#39;s thesis is built
[3840.4s] on something you won&#39;t hear anyone else,
[3842.559s] underappreciated demand. He projects
[3845.2s] global demand could reach 6 to 10
[3846.88s] million metric tonses by 2035. We&#39;ve
[3850.72s] been talking about it going from 1.2 to
[3852.88s] 3.2. So, if this happens, this thing
[3855.119s] could be a five bagger. But let&#39;s just
[3857.119s] be realistic here. Um, or conservative
[3860.0s] again. Demand in 2024 was about 1.2
[3862.64s] million and Alba Mar&#39;s high-end forecast
[3864.72s] for 2030 is 3.3. That&#39;s in line with our
[3867.599s] forecast. This guy&#39;s talking double or
[3869.2s] triple that. And we see a threebagger
[3871.119s] just on on the conservative estimates.
[3873.44s] If that scenario plays out, Albero isn&#39;t
[3875.68s] just a double, it&#39;s a multiagger. Now on
[3877.28s] to Albero earnings. Here&#39;s everything
[3878.72s] you need to know following the Q1
[3880.079s] report. You can go through this step by
[3882.079s] step. Uh break even free cash flow in
[3885.839s] 2025. That&#39;s key in trough prices. is
[3888.88s] the fact that they can be break even. By
[3890.64s] the way, this is a dividend aristocrat.
[3892.24s] They&#39;ve raised a dividend every single
[3894.079s] year for over 30 years. Uh that&#39;s going
[3896.88s] to continue to happen. You can lock in a
[3898.559s] very uh low basis so that um
[3903.119s] as the dividend, you know, you&#39;ll lock
[3905.76s] in whatever it is 2 and a half or 3%
[3908.319s] whatever it is now. But even as the
[3910.4s] price goes up, the dividend yield on
[3913.2s] your basis is going to keep going up as
[3914.88s] they keep increasing the dividend. And
[3916.72s] then if you reinvest it, you can really
[3919.2s] compound money. Anyway, here are the 10
[3921.2s] key points. Through April, management
[3922.799s] achieved 90% run rate against the
[3924.319s] midpoint of their 350 million cost and
[3926.4s] productivity savings program. More
[3928.319s] importantly, they&#39;ve identified
[3929.599s] additional opportunities to reach the
[3930.88s] high end of 300 to $400 million range
[3932.88s] with potential for even more upside.
[3934.799s] Adjusted Ebida margins in Q1 came in at
[3937.599s] 25% up 400 basis points year-on-year in
[3940.48s] a trough cycle. This is unbelievable.
[3942.48s] With SGNA costs down over 20% as the
[3945.039s] cost savings program continues to bear
[3946.799s] fruit. Three, in light of cycllically
[3948.559s] low prices, management continues to cut
[3950.24s] back on capex with full year 2025
[3952.24s] expectations of 700 to 800 million, down
[3954.96s] more than 50% year-on-year. This comes
[3956.96s] down from an already low base in 2024.
[3959.76s] That was reduced by over 450 million
[3961.599s] compared to 2023&#39;s 2.1 billion of capex.
[3964.559s] The long-term midcycle capex target
[3966.4s] remains around 6% of revenues. cash from
[3968.72s] operations uh in Q1 totaled four $545
[3972.72s] million including a 350 million customer
[3975.359s] prepayment resulting in an operating
[3977.039s] cash flow conversion of 204% excluding
[3979.76s] the prepaid pay payment conversion still
[3982.319s] came in at 73% above above the long-term
[3984.799s] average of 60 or 70% bringing fullear
[3987.2s] 2025 expectations to north of 80% five
[3990.48s] not only did management maintain their
[3992.0s] full year 2025 outlook they also
[3994.079s] reiterated their expectation of break
[3996.319s] even free cash flow for for the year
[3998.16s] after delivering slightly positive free
[3999.68s] cash flow in Q1 with positive free cash
[4001.52s] flow expected during 2026. Six, the
[4005.359s] direct impact of tariffs is expected to
[4007.039s] be minimal, totaling 30 to 40 million
[4008.799s] for the full year before any
[4010.24s] mitigations. This is largely due to
[4011.68s] Albamaro&#39;s global footprint with most
[4013.76s] lithium production sold directly to Asia
[4016.0s] and the critical mineral exemptions that
[4017.76s] are currently in place. Management has
[4019.599s] mitigations underway to significantly
[4022.0s] reduce the overall realized impact,
[4023.68s] including increased sales to lower
[4025.039s] tariff countries and optimizing supply
[4026.72s] chain. Seven management has estimated
[4029.2s] that 40% of the current global lithium
[4031.359s] capacity is at or below break even with
[4034.0s] only a third of that supply having come
[4035.359s] offline. Aka the number of the longer
[4039.119s] prices remain in the pain zone the more
[4040.799s] lowquality marginal producers will get
[4042.48s] taken out on a stretcher. Eight for the
[4044.4s] full year lithium demand is expected to
[4046.079s] grow between 15 to 40% with management
[4049.359s] currently forecasting growth around the
[4051.2s] mid 20% range. Long-term demand growth
[4053.839s] remains strong with lithium demand
[4055.839s] projected to more than 2x 2030 from 1.2
[4061.2s] million metric tonses in 2024 and up to
[4064.319s] 3.3 million metric tonses growing at a
[4067.28s] near 20% kagger. Despite the headline
[4069.76s] noise, global EV demand continues to
[4072.0s] remain strong, up 34% yearonear. Strong
[4074.799s] sales in China continue to weigh lead
[4076.72s] the way up up 41% year-onear and remain
[4079.44s] over 60% of the total EV global EV
[4081.92s] market. Long-term demand expectations
[4083.92s] remained intact with EV market
[4085.44s] penetration expected to exceed IC by the
[4088.48s] end of the decade reaching about 54%
[4090.559s] global penetration and 10 stationary
[4093.44s] storage continues to be one of the main
[4095.28s] drivers for lithium. The market is
[4097.359s] expected to grow at 20 to 30% kagger
[4099.679s] through 2030. Uh growing
[4103.279s] from 190 to in 2024 to between 600 and
[4106.799s] 970 in 2030.
[4109.199s] Earnings call highlights you can go
[4110.88s] through at hedge funtips.com.
[4114.159s] And then
[4116.08s] um here&#39;s an article from Morning Star
[4119.12s] with a fair value. Lithium prices will
[4122.319s] rebound then remain well above the
[4123.92s] marginal cost of production through the
[4125.44s] at least the remainder of decade leading
[4126.88s] to excess profits and return on invested
[4129.04s] capital for Albamaro. Therefore, they
[4131.04s] have a $200 fair value on the stock down
[4135.359s] from 225. The stock is trading at about
[4138.4s] $60 right now. So, they&#39;re looking at a
[4140.319s] threebagger plus uh in a handful of
[4143.52s] years or less. I think it&#39;s going to be
[4145.279s] more and uh we&#39;re excited about it. So,
[4148.159s] that&#39;s that. Moving along, earnings top
[4151.279s] 30 weights of financials last 60 days
[4154.0s] revised up uh 0.19% and 06% for 2025.
[4162.88s] What was one of those companies that got
[4164.88s] revised up was PayPal, baby. How you
[4168.56s] like that? Healthcare top 30 weights
[4171.6s] revisions last 60 days down 3% and 2.85%
[4176.319s] 8 5% in 2025 and 2026 respectively.
[4180.719s] Let&#39;s see what were the biggest downs.
[4184.08s] Lily. Uh so pro probably a lot of these
[4187.04s] um GLP1s. Okay, if you remember uh
[4193.04s] that let&#39;s see here
[4198.0s] Sigma probably a little unh there. All
[4200.719s] right, moving along.
[4203.36s] Retail sales were down. So, you know,
[4205.28s] Powell has all the cover to act if he
[4208.0s] wants to. He doesn&#39;t want to because he
[4210.159s] doesn&#39;t understand history. He thinks
[4211.44s] this is the 70s. This has no resemblance
[4213.92s] to the 70s, but it&#39;ll be what it&#39;ll be.
[4216.56s] Powell, Trump will start name dropping,
[4219.12s] doing some trial bombs for a shadow Fed.
[4221.199s] Everyone will ignore Powell will be a
[4222.8s] lame duck till the end of his term, and
[4225.04s] people will start to price in 200 basis
[4227.44s] points of cuts for next May uh in the
[4230.0s] coming two quarters. Uh earnings growth
[4233.12s] low bar for Q2. Expectations are 4.9%
[4237.199s] earnings growth down from 9.3% at the
[4240.48s] end of March which sets up the stage for
[4243.28s] earnings beat and a continuation of the
[4245.44s] rally through midsummer before we get
[4247.92s] into the normal chop sideways stuff
[4250.32s] August, September, October prior to year
[4253.28s] end rally. With that said, the podcast
[4255.6s] is over. Now, we&#39;re going to move on to
[4257.52s] the ask me anything questions for those
[4259.44s] of you get a lot of value from questions
[4261.6s] from our audience as we go through
[4263.36s] individual companies. The rest of you
[4265.04s] will see you next week, same time,
[4267.52s] different place. I&#39;ll be in New York,
[4269.76s] uh, and Connecticut. So, Evore Barry,
[4273.52s] uh, if you had a gun to your head, what
[4274.88s] new stock would you add to the portfolio
[4276.4s] and why? Uh, that&#39;s like asking me
[4278.719s] what&#39;s my favorite kid. The answer is
[4280.56s] you can&#39;t take it discreetly. We always
[4282.48s] take it into context of our 8 to 12
[4285.04s] companies that we want to be
[4286.159s] concentrated at the moment and uh our
[4288.56s] new clients will find out which ones
[4290.159s] they are on July 1st. So that&#39;s that.
[4293.52s] Our existing clients already know which
[4295.12s] ones they are. Nate Kelsey uh your
[4298.0s] podcasts have been extremely educational
[4299.52s] and I&#39;ve looked forward to the weekly
[4300.96s] updates for more than two years now. Big
[4303.199s] beautiful bill currently under
[4304.4s] consideration includes a roll off of
[4305.92s] solar tax credit. Okay, so he&#39;s asking
[4307.76s] about Nphase. I&#39;ve been asked about
[4309.199s] Nphase every week for the last two
[4311.44s] years. I&#39;ve continued to say no. It&#39;s
[4313.28s] continued to go lower. Um, you know,
[4316.0s] these stocks
[4318.88s] did do well under Trump 1.0.
[4328.8s] So,
[4330.56s] counterintuitively and energy stocks did
[4332.88s] not.
[4334.64s] and PH the problem is I think all their
[4336.96s] balance sheets are toast and if there&#39;s
[4338.64s] going to be no subsidies
[4340.8s] uh from the government I mean that
[4343.28s] that&#39;s the big thing that&#39;s why Elon got
[4345.6s] pissed is because the bill guts all the
[4348.0s] climate spend and um
[4352.32s] so they&#39;ve got some free cash flow how&#39;s
[4354.239s] this balance sheet
[4375.92s] 1.6 billion of cash, $1.2 billion of
[4378.719s] debt.
[4394.159s] Yeah, I mean the big problem with this
[4396.159s] is, you know, it was a 300 bagger off
[4398.239s] the lows. It is a broken growth stock.
[4401.12s] It&#39;s going to take an awfully long time
[4402.8s] to build a new set of shareholders. And
[4406.0s] looking at the financials, I think it
[4407.6s] looks okay, but I&#39;m not inclined to do
[4409.76s] anything with this at the moment, but I
[4411.84s] am inclined to start to do some work on
[4413.76s] it. So, I&#39;ll leave it there, but uh
[4416.8s] nothing really
[4419.28s] exciting about that. York Bourgeoa,
[4422.64s] uh hope your week has been going well. I
[4424.56s] had a question regarding your approach
[4426.159s] of enterprise value versus equity value.
[4428.64s] Wondering what you valued more,
[4429.92s] especially Thank that&#39;s not it&#39;s not
[4435.12s] even a framework way to think about it.
[4437.36s] You always have to consider enterprise
[4438.88s] value
[4440.56s] uh debt plus equity minus cash uh
[4443.04s] because that&#39;s
[4445.28s] total capital invested and you have to
[4447.52s] consider the total return on invested
[4449.36s] capital. Uh I do look at equity value. I
[4453.36s] tend to favor that a little bit more as
[4454.8s] an equity investor but I also analyze it
[4457.28s] on the basis of enterprise value because
[4459.44s] I want to I want to calculate total
[4461.28s] capital and the return on total capital.
[4463.12s] So, um
[4466.0s] I don&#39;t think it&#39;s relevant to getting
[4468.239s] the outcome that&#39;s going to give you
[4470.4s] alpha,
[4472.64s] but I do think you need to do both is
[4474.48s] the answer to your question. Kyler
[4476.0s] Johnson,
[4478.64s] uh
[4480.48s] I don&#39;t touch this one. Focus right
[4484.239s] ticker tune. Let&#39;s take a look at that.
[4503.679s] Uh, right. It&#39;s not a US stock, I guess.
[4508.719s] T N E.
[4513.04s] Yeah, it&#39;s British stock. All right,
[4515.12s] cool.
[4523.0s] [Music]
[4537.36s] Wow. Complete round trip. Let&#39;s see.
[4556.2s] [Music]
[4564.159s] Huh?
[4576.56s] I mean this is a tiny business. Uh what
[4578.719s] do they do for let&#39;s say 28 million?
[4596.56s] All right. What do they actually do
[4614.64s] development manufacturer market
[4616.159s] professional audio and electric music
[4618.64s] products?
[4622.46s] [Music]
[4627.6s] This is a niche tiny little small cap
[4629.679s] business.
[4631.76s] Um,
[4634.64s] yeah. I just don&#39;t know the business. I
[4636.48s] mean,
[4639.36s] you really have to understand what is
[4641.76s] their mo what&#39;s their competitive
[4643.28s] advantage. Is this the go-to? Like, no
[4645.199s] one really competes with them for these
[4646.96s] products. Are they that good? Why is
[4649.199s] growth slowown so much? What&#39;s the plan
[4651.199s] to reacelerate? Or does every guitar
[4653.199s] player already have one of these
[4654.56s] synthesizers? But I do like that the
[4657.28s] turnaround story looks interesting for
[4659.28s] sure. Um I just I would just have to
[4662.88s] have confidence in the product and
[4665.04s] understand the moat, which I don&#39;t think
[4666.4s] I&#39;m ever going to have a real edge on.
[4668.48s] Uh but if you do, you know, know what
[4670.56s] you own, I think you got something here.
[4672.64s] You just really have to go through all
[4675.04s] the public filings and the last maybe
[4678.159s] eight conference calls, see what
[4679.76s] management has said, see what they&#39;ve
[4681.28s] done, see what they&#39;re promising, how
[4682.8s] are they going to turn around, how are
[4684.0s] they going to reacelerate growth, and
[4686.159s] you might have something here. So, I
[4688.08s] think uh I think Kyler Johnson is on to
[4692.239s] something and finding a niche
[4693.679s] opportunity there that may turn out to
[4695.92s] be something good for him. So, good
[4697.44s] work. Uh let&#39;s move to the next one.
[4700.719s] Mark Callaway, thanks for all you do. I
[4703.52s] sing your praises to anyone who will
[4704.8s] listen and they all thank me for it
[4706.159s] later. Well, thank you for that. By the
[4708.08s] way, uh very grateful for your support
[4711.04s] and uh tuning in each week. If you&#39;re
[4713.52s] getting value, which I know so many of
[4715.84s] you are from the beautiful notes that
[4717.52s] you send in uh and testimonials which
[4720.239s] you can find on the website and on the
[4722.239s] YouTube uh every week on the videos. All
[4725.199s] I can ask is one, at the very least, go
[4727.28s] to YouTube and write a um uh comment and
[4732.64s] give your feedback. That helps push it
[4734.64s] up. The more people that view this, the
[4736.32s] longer we&#39;re going to do it for
[4737.28s] non-clients. Um uh you know, like,
[4741.28s] subscribe to the channel. Just go to
[4743.44s] YouTube, type in the search bar hedge
[4745.04s] fun tips. The hedge fun tip channel will
[4746.64s] come up. And then the best compliment
[4748.8s] you could pay me uh if you&#39;re not a
[4751.36s] client or not able to do business with
[4752.96s] us uh is to share it with one person you
[4756.64s] like and loves and you know loves
[4759.52s] markets and would really benefit from
[4761.28s] this framework and help them make a lot
[4762.88s] of money. So um grateful for you doing
[4765.679s] that and um I invite the rest of you uh
[4768.96s] if you want to give back that&#39;s that&#39;s
[4770.32s] one great way to do it. Uh so his
[4772.56s] question is do you think Coinbase
[4773.84s] entering the payment market for
[4775.12s] e-commerce and Robin Hood rumored to do
[4777.199s] so in the fall will affect PayPal? Uh I
[4780.64s] PayPal has such a mode at this point
[4782.56s] that the amount of stock they&#39;re going
[4784.4s] to buy in 20% of the company. Uh they
[4787.12s] are the sixth largest stable coin. I&#39;m
[4788.96s] watching that part of the business. They
[4790.96s] have margin recovery. Alex Chris what he
[4793.679s] created at into it running 50% of the
[4796.159s] revenues. Multi multi multibagger. Uh,
[4799.44s] I&#39;d bet on Alex Chris way before I bet
[4803.04s] on either of these two CEOs. As much as
[4805.44s] the success that they&#39;ve had, Coinbase,
[4807.84s] I think, is going to get commoditized at
[4809.92s] some point. Uh, brokerages, uh, uh,
[4814.56s] everyone&#39;s super excited about Robin
[4816.239s] Hood, uh, and it&#39;s had a good run, and
[4818.56s] Vlad seems to be a good CEO, but all of
[4821.04s] that gets gets mar the margins just get
[4824.32s] eroded. The brokerage business has never
[4826.239s] been a durable competitive moat that
[4828.56s] doesn&#39;t get competed away over time.
[4830.32s] Robin Hood and Coinbase will be no
[4831.92s] different. Uh so yeah, I I continue to
[4834.56s] like PayPal over those.
[4837.199s] Sagar
[4839.04s] Kaya
[4841.679s] curious your preference about Intel over
[4843.6s] AMD. Uh very simple.
[4847.36s] How many fabs does AMD have in Arizona
[4850.8s] or Ohio? And that&#39;s all you need to know
[4853.679s] is that the government, whether they
[4855.44s] like Intel or hate Intel, needs Intel.
[4858.159s] And we need to produce chips in the US.
[4860.08s] Yes, Taiwan Semiconductor uh has fabs,
[4863.199s] but they&#39;re going to need unlimited
[4865.199s] numbers. And in Intel has the 5-year
[4868.4s] runway. This will be
[4871.6s] one of the greatest hockey stick stories
[4873.92s] from most hated to most loved in the
[4875.92s] shortest period of time. When it turns,
[4877.52s] it&#39;s going to turn all at once. uh AMD
[4880.96s] there&#39;s too much downside. I understand
[4883.6s] what the upside is, but
[4887.679s] the downside is material and there&#39;s
[4889.44s] nothing to back them up because there&#39;s
[4890.88s] nothing they have that their customers
[4893.76s] can&#39;t find another solution elsewhere.
[4896.4s] Whereas Intel, once their fabs are
[4898.239s] rolling,
[4904.0s] they&#39;re going to have a US duopoly with
[4905.84s] TSMC.
[4907.84s] So that&#39;s that. But you you&#39;ll notice
[4911.44s] that a number of these
[4913.679s] questions, just note the names and what
[4916.719s] was in the headlines this week. You have
[4918.4s] to just keep that in mind, ladies and
[4919.84s] gentlemen. Uh that&#39;s Brandon coming in.
[4922.56s] Thank you, Paul Gritz. Girtz. Paul
[4925.679s] Girtz. Hey, Paul. Uh could you look at
[4927.84s] Clorox? Yeah, we&#39;ve looked at this one.
[4930.0s] We do like this one. I&#39;m not sold on the
[4933.28s] CEO. she&#39;s kind of been fussing around
[4937.44s] FUTZ
[4939.04s] uh for too long. So, I would like to see
[4941.76s] a replacement of the CEO if that hasn&#39;t
[4945.28s] already happened. But yeah, this is a
[4947.04s] long-term compounder with a moat. Um
[4950.96s] that&#39;s just been a little bit mismanaged
[4952.719s] of late.
[4955.36s] So, free cash flow. I mean, look, the
[4957.12s] revenues haven&#39;t begun to recover.
[4959.04s] Margins are recovering. Uh, I I I think
[4962.88s] I think this one is probably fine here.
[4965.199s] If you could get it at a 100 bucks or
[4967.679s] 110 bucks, that would be even better.
[4969.36s] But I think for the long term, this
[4971.36s] one&#39;s generally going to be okay. And I
[4973.28s] like the thing. It&#39;s one that keeps
[4974.88s] popping up that I&#39;m not doing anything
[4976.32s] with because it&#39;s not an easy double in
[4978.56s] a reasonable amount of time, but um I
[4981.199s] think you&#39;ll get nice returns and um
[4983.52s] pretty handsome dividend while you wait
[4985.28s] if I&#39;m not mistaken. Let me just see
[4988.159s] here.
[5007.36s] four 4% dividend yield while you wait.
[5009.76s] My guess,
[5013.12s] let&#39;s see what they&#39;ve been doing with
[5014.48s] the dividend.
[5032.08s] Can&#39;t even get in. All right. Um I think
[5035.199s] they&#39;ve been increasing it quite a bit
[5036.719s] over time. So that&#39;s a good one. Or an
[5040.56s] okay one rather.
[5045.199s] Okay. Allan sending me the bull bear.
[5047.6s] That&#39;s Thank you. Uh, hope this email
[5051.92s] finds you well. Wanted to chat about the
[5053.679s] jobs numbers, retirees, blah blah blah.
[5056.96s] Frank, none of that&#39;s going to make us
[5058.239s] any money. We deal with companies.
[5059.76s] That&#39;s all just macro noise. Uh, Simon
[5063.84s] Stazzy,
[5066.48s] Icon Enterprises, no thank you. Where
[5069.679s] there&#39;s smoke, there might be fire.
[5071.44s] absolute legend, but there was too much
[5073.84s] intercomp financial chicainery going.
[5077.199s] I&#39;m not interested, even though I love
[5079.44s] what he&#39;s done over the years. I love
[5080.96s] his framework. Uh, that one makes me a
[5083.84s] little nervous. Uh, stumbled upon Zeta
[5086.08s] Global.
[5089.36s] Let&#39;s take a look. Lucas.
[5091.61s] [Music]
[5117.199s] Well, All
[5124.0s] right. So, first thing I want to figure
[5125.36s] out is why the margins have come down so
[5127.52s] much. Let&#39;s take a look at uh let&#39;s take
[5132.32s] a look at
[5140.56s] All right. So, the revenues are growing
[5142.0s] like a weed.
[5147.84s] I mean what
[5150.4s] the share count&#39;s gone from 31 million
[5152.32s] to 186 million. So
[5155.52s] congratulations they so okay so revenues
[5158.719s] have grown 3x the share count has grown
[5162.88s] uh
[5165.199s] 6x. So the share counts grown twice the
[5168.239s] pace of the revenue and
[5176.4s] the business.
[5180.159s] What&#39;s cash flow done?
[5184.32s] Forex
[5189.12s] balance sheet&#39;s probably clean.
[5204.32s] Yeah, I just I do not like that kind of
[5207.6s] growth in in the share count
[5214.04s] [Music]
[5215.28s] marketing automation.
[5217.36s] Yeah. Uh,
[5220.239s] no. I I just don&#39;t think I mean I have
[5222.159s] no confidence in knowing they&#39;re not
[5223.44s] going to take the share count to 700
[5225.04s] million. So I Yeah, I I don&#39;t I don&#39;t
[5228.56s] like these type of managements. So not
[5230.719s] for me. Uh John H
[5235.12s] loving the podcast.
[5240.56s] Pittney Bose. No, no. There&#39;s a lot of
[5243.6s] people promoting Pney Bows and the
[5245.28s] story&#39;s changed and it looks better,
[5247.04s] blah, blah, blah. It&#39;s not for me.
[5249.77s] [Music]
[5251.44s] And it&#39;s already moved anyway, so you&#39;re
[5253.199s] kind of late. Let&#39;s take a look at the
[5254.96s] story here. We We&#39;ve done this one
[5256.719s] before. I I I don&#39;t like it. I know the
[5259.199s] business has changed. I know they&#39;ve got
[5260.48s] all this story about how it&#39;s going to
[5262.239s] be better. They have this every five
[5264.0s] years, and every five years it&#39;s the
[5265.6s] exact same result. pops up, insiders
[5268.96s] sell stock, reverts back. Not for me.
[5273.12s] Uh,
[5274.719s] Eric C,
[5276.88s] love listening to your podcast. Do you
[5278.239s] think Merc is doing more?
[5281.92s] Fears of the two products having
[5283.36s] competition.
[5285.12s] Generic&#39;s not doing well. Ah, I Yeah, I
[5288.48s] I keep looking at Mkin doing nothing,
[5291.52s] but I think it&#39;s probably ready.
[5298.159s] it. Yeah, it just hasn&#39;t come in enough
[5301.12s] for me to get super interested, but it&#39;s
[5302.8s] on my watch list. I&#39; I&#39;d be a pass here.
[5305.6s] I&#39; I needed to come down more before I&#39;d
[5307.52s] get interested, and it may not do. So,
[5309.12s] Tommo of the podcast.
[5313.199s] Uh, what small caps? We We Jack, we&#39;ve
[5315.28s] already covered like Comtock, we&#39;ve
[5318.08s] covered uh Cooper Standard, we&#39;ve I
[5321.04s] mean, we have a lot of small caps. Um,
[5324.4s] we own Canada Goose is a tiny position.
[5327.199s] So, all the small caps we&#39;ve covered.
[5328.8s] Otherwise, just buy an emer uh small cap
[5332.48s] uh ETF. Opinion not advice, but you got
[5334.96s] to get exposure to small caps and just
[5337.04s] don&#39;t think about it for the next three
[5338.32s] to five years. Matt Dell Priori,
[5344.08s] uh, I covered this somewhat recently,
[5345.76s] but have you thought about Nike? Yes,
[5347.36s] I&#39;ve thought about it and I have VF Corp
[5350.32s] is a better uh, riskreward. I mean, Nike
[5354.56s] is probably going to take longer than
[5356.159s] everyone thinks. Uh, Nike could be a
[5359.199s] double or triple. I think it&#39;s going to
[5360.32s] take five years. I think VF Corp can be
[5362.159s] a multibagger in three or less. So, for
[5365.76s] that reason, I I think Nike is good
[5367.52s] here. I We&#39;re just We&#39;re just not going
[5369.44s] to own it at the moment. We higher and
[5371.92s] better use. Raph Goldburn
[5376.56s] safe store in the UK.
[5381.52s] Um,
[5384.239s] s a fe.l.
[5389.52s] All right. Cut in half.
[5400.48s] Free cash flow peaked
[5403.199s] three years ago along pretty much along
[5406.159s] with revenues. Return on capitals
[5408.08s] continued to erode. Margins have
[5409.76s] continued to erode. What do they do?
[5412.719s] They are self storage group 209 stores.
[5424.4s] Yeah, I I have no edge on this because I
[5426.48s] don&#39;t know what the supply demand
[5427.6s] situation is on that. Um,
[5432.48s] you&#39;d really have to study the industry
[5434.159s] to to have an informed opinion on that.
[5437.76s] Uh,
[5441.84s] let me just see something here.
[5450.08s] Again, this is a broken growth stock,
[5452.96s] but it may be it may be close. Let&#39;s
[5455.679s] just take a look. I&#39;m sure there&#39;s Yeah,
[5457.679s] I mean, there&#39;s a billion dollars of
[5458.88s] debt. It&#39;s supported by the assets, but
[5462.639s] you&#39;re cutting it. What&#39;s happening with
[5464.8s] the free cash flow?
[5476.719s] Yeah, it&#39;s pretty steady. I I don&#39;t
[5479.04s] really have
[5481.6s] an edge on that business in Europe, so
[5485.92s] for that reason, I&#39;d probably pass. But
[5488.88s] it might be worth you doing more work if
[5490.96s] if uh you think there&#39;s an opportunity
[5493.28s] there. Let&#39;s just see here.
[5503.679s] Yeah, just just
[5510.8s] you might have something. It&#39;s not
[5512.4s] something that I would look at, but I
[5514.08s] appreciate you sending it in. Joshua
[5515.6s] Kaplan Sprouts Farmers Market
[5520.32s] SFM.
[5522.0s] This has always been a bad business, but
[5524.0s] let&#39;s see what it looks like now.
[5527.45s] [Music]
[5536.32s] Looks like it&#39;s recovering.
[5540.159s] SFM.
[5542.88s] Wow.
[5546.08s] Wow. Wow. Wow. Wow. Wow. This is
[5548.239s] absolutely I mean the
[5555.72s] [Music]
[5584.0s] What I can tell you is supermarkets are
[5585.679s] never a good business. So you have a run
[5587.36s] here, you&#39;re expanding, everything looks
[5589.52s] good. Eventually, you&#39;re going to hit a
[5591.199s] brick wall and you&#39;re going to crash
[5592.8s] just like you see in the Tik Tok memes
[5594.719s] where the where the 18-wheeler, you
[5597.92s] know, tests like a Land Rover test a
[5601.28s] Tesla and they all smash into the wall
[5603.04s] like an accordion. That&#39;s what happens
[5604.8s] when you own uh grocery store stock. So,
[5607.36s] I would I would just uh avoid it like
[5610.239s] the plague. It&#39;s almost as bad as
[5611.6s] airlines, except airlines you can buy
[5613.199s] cyclical troughs if their balance sheets
[5614.96s] are okay and play make a quick double or
[5617.28s] triple. But uh uh supermarkets are just
[5620.96s] bad news. So I I wouldn&#39;t touch it.
[5623.199s] James Deers, unless you think that
[5625.44s] you&#39;re going to get a lot of inflation,
[5627.6s] uh and their inventory value goes up,
[5629.36s] but that&#39;s that&#39;s a sucker game. I
[5630.96s] wouldn&#39;t play it. Uh Tom, appreciate
[5632.96s] your wise uh council opinion. Thanks for
[5635.76s] all you do.
[5638.159s] Uh wondering if you&#39;d have time to talk
[5640.4s] to Jeff Edwards about
[5643.04s] the China tease that he gave on the
[5644.639s] previous interview. Yeah, look,
[5646.719s] everything he needed to say was on
[5648.159s] there. The business is great. Be
[5649.679s] patient. Stop looking at price on a day
[5652.239s] basis. You&#39;ll be fine. Um, and by the
[5655.6s] way, you&#39;re already up four 4x, so
[5658.0s] chillax. Um, sorry it&#39;s not 10x in two
[5661.28s] minutes, but thank you for the question.
[5663.92s] Um, UD Audit, thanks for all the great
[5667.76s] insights for your podcast. You&#39;re just
[5669.12s] amazing. Thank you very much, Odd.
[5670.719s] That&#39;s very nice.
[5672.88s] Um, safe doubles, triples.
[5680.56s] Yeah, Dagio and Crown Castle. Absolutely
[5684.08s] fine. Uh, Terry S and we own both of
[5688.08s] them. Thank you for your content and
[5689.84s] hosting the podcast. Love it. Question.
[5693.76s] How can I learn to analyze and see
[5695.12s] markets like you do? Uh, 20 years in the
[5698.0s] business. Uh, listen to the podcast
[5700.08s] every week. Get your CFA I think is key.
[5702.32s] if you&#39;re young. Um, Warren Buffett&#39;s
[5705.679s] annual letters, must readad books is
[5707.92s] intelligent investor by Ben Graham for
[5709.84s] starters. And we&#39;ve covered like lists
[5712.48s] of like 10 or 20 books in the past. But
[5715.04s] that&#39;s the starting point and then go
[5717.12s] from there. Enjoy the journey. You&#39;ll
[5719.76s] find out after reading the intelligent
[5721.28s] investor whether this is what you should
[5722.639s] do with your life. Uh, if you&#39;re just
[5724.719s] joining because you think it&#39;s going to
[5726.08s] be a great way to only a great way to
[5728.4s] make money, I would go into another
[5730.0s] business, be an entrepreneur. If you&#39;re
[5731.6s] joining because it&#39;s what you want to do
[5733.04s] 247,
[5734.56s] um then you might have a chance after 10
[5736.32s] or 20 years to get an edge and find your
[5738.88s] own unique style that um that can
[5741.36s] deliver value for your clients. Uh John
[5743.92s] Martin,
[5745.92s] Omegalex,
[5748.48s] gas piping in residential
[5755.76s] construction.
[5759.84s] O F L X.
[5775.52s] This business is low quality.
[5781.44s] OF LX and very very small.
[5787.0s] [Music]
[5799.04s] margins are holding up. Let me just see
[5801.76s] here.
[5812.0s] Pretty good balance sheet.
[5819.119s] I mean, the revenues haven&#39;t gone
[5820.48s] anywhere
[5822.08s] in six years.
[5824.639s] They&#39;re actually down. So, I just don&#39;t
[5827.119s] know what the growth story is from a
[5828.56s] stock perspective. Um,
[5831.52s] share counts been pretty steady. I mean,
[5834.0s] this is the kind of business that
[5842.48s] 20 million of free cash flow,
[5851.98s] [Music]
[5856.56s] 4% dividend yield. They don&#39;t expect
[5858.88s] growth either, paying out that kind of
[5860.4s] dividend.
[5868.8s] So you&#39;re paying
[5871.119s] enterprise value is 282 million for 20
[5874.48s] million of free cash flow for a flat
[5877.76s] flattish business that shows no signs of
[5880.56s] growth.
[5881.92s] Uh
[5884.48s] yeah, it has definitely
[5888.32s] operating leverage relative to housing
[5890.4s] recovery,
[5895.76s] but I want to start to understand the
[5897.44s] turnaround story from management before
[5899.28s] I even look at it. I I think I mean this
[5903.679s] could easily go to 10 before it starts
[5905.52s] to recover. So management better start
[5907.44s] to show some signs of recovery because
[5909.6s] if it&#39;s if it&#39;s going to continue to
[5911.04s] have flat to negative revenue and
[5915.84s] financials,
[5917.6s] uh there&#39;s no telling how low it can go.
[5920.32s] It it had its run. It&#39;s a broken stock.
[5923.04s] You know, here we are five years later.
[5927.36s] It fits with the theme, but it&#39;s it&#39;s
[5929.119s] it&#39;s too small of a business that it&#39;s
[5933.44s] there&#39;s no there&#39;s no moat. It&#39;s not
[5935.199s] like it was huge and it got hit, but
[5937.52s] everyone still needs their products.
[5938.96s] This is like a hundred million dollar
[5940.48s] business. It&#39;s like if if it ceased to
[5942.08s] exist tomorrow, it wouldn&#39;t affect
[5943.44s] anyone. If like Cooper Standard ceased
[5945.44s] to exist, it would hurt a lot of OEMs.
[5947.6s] It would like delay their lines, all the
[5949.6s] value ad that they&#39;ve done. So, I don&#39;t
[5951.76s] see why this business needs to exist,
[5953.52s] but at some price, it makes sense. I
[5956.0s] just don&#39;t know if this is the price
[5957.44s] yet. And you&#39;d have to listen to four to
[5959.92s] eight conference calls and really
[5961.119s] understand why and how they believe they
[5964.159s] can turn this around and it better be uh
[5967.52s] unassalable.
[5969.28s] Terry S, big follower of Tom and his
[5970.96s] podcast. Love the analyst. Oh, this guy
[5973.76s] wants to build a website for me. Terry,
[5976.159s] send a mockup to info@
[5977.44s] hedgefundtips.com. I&#39;ll take a look at
[5979.119s] it. As long as it doesn&#39;t affect the
[5980.96s] functionality, I&#39;m open-minded. But at
[5982.88s] the end of the day, I&#39;m, you know,
[5985.76s] there&#39;s an old saying, big big hat, no
[5988.719s] cattle. You know, fancy website, no
[5990.719s] substance. I have an ugly website, tons
[5992.8s] of substance. I kind of like to keep it
[5994.239s] that way. If you look at Bergkshire
[5995.44s] Hathaway&#39;s website, it looks like it was
[5998.48s] done by a three-year-old 30 years ago.
[6000.88s] Uh, and they&#39;ve done just fine. So, uh,
[6003.36s] I&#39;m open-minded, but, uh, not a top
[6005.6s] priority unless you completely wow me.
[6008.32s] And thank you for the offer. Uh Emil
[6013.36s] Bamante,
[6016.48s] any plans to get some exposure to
[6018.8s] rapidly growing commercial space
[6020.32s] industry? Already have it through
[6021.679s] Boeing?
[6024.159s] Uh Dave Burgerer, thoughts on Boston
[6027.92s] Beer Company, Hard Pass?
[6032.159s] Uh,
[6033.84s] Mark Dory
[6039.76s] 212 Retail UK brokerage.
[6043.92s] Uh, I I don&#39;t like the brokerage
[6045.44s] business at all. Even as excited as
[6048.08s] everyone is about Robin Hood and crypto
[6049.84s] and all that stuff, it&#39;s not what I say.
[6051.6s] Uh, you didn&#39;t send me a ticker, so I&#39;m
[6053.52s] going to pass on this one.
[6056.8s] I I just don&#39;t like the brokerage
[6058.239s] business generally. Cork Snyder
[6063.92s] uh talked about Ray Dallio a bit. Why
[6066.48s] his countries go broke? He&#39;s sees
[6068.639s] America blah blah blah.
[6072.239s] Uh we&#39;re in the 2030s we begin to have
[6074.8s] issues due to population issues. Yeah.
[6077.52s] Look, Cork, uh here&#39;s what I can tell
[6080.48s] you. When the music is playing, get up
[6082.08s] and dance. I think the music is going to
[6083.6s] be playing at least to 2030 and beyond.
[6086.32s] Uh and uh if Dalio&#39;s pessimistic about
[6089.28s] the 2030s, I tend to agree, but by then
[6092.0s] we&#39;ll have made so much money and cashed
[6093.679s] out uh and be sitting in cash and
[6096.88s] defensive in the early 2030s when the
[6099.04s] population falls off in the US that uh
[6102.4s] we&#39;ll be buying bargains like it&#39;s going
[6103.92s] out of style from probably 2034 to 2040
[6108.719s] uh and God willing and um and make an
[6111.76s] absolute
[6113.52s] killing on on
[6116.159s] uh beyond that. But but for now, like
[6118.08s] that&#39;s so far off. I don&#39;t you know,
[6119.52s] Dalio predicting the 2030s are going to
[6121.36s] be bad. I I I tend to agree with him,
[6123.36s] but what precedes that is a booming
[6126.88s] 2020s and that&#39;s at least five to seven
[6129.52s] years more of non-stop money-m. Uh
[6134.96s] ride the bull while you got it. and uh
[6137.04s] and there&#39;s no
[6139.36s] all the factors are lined up for things
[6141.52s] to be super amazingly strong till the
[6144.239s] early 2030s and then after that then
[6145.84s] Dalio might be right and and we might
[6147.6s] have a problem but uh we&#39;ll deal with
[6149.28s] that then I wouldn&#39;t worry about it now
[6152.159s] unless you&#39;re trying to sell a book. So
[6155.679s] uh Jimmy Jones
[6158.96s] Windtock
[6163.119s] wish your family blessings. Thank you.
[6165.36s] Wish your family blessings. Win stock. I
[6168.0s] think you&#39;re okay here. But this is just
[6169.52s] like this. This thing just trades in a
[6171.92s] range back and forth. You&#39;re probably at
[6173.76s] the low end of the range. It&#39;s a good
[6175.36s] business. Best in class, but you&#39;re not
[6178.48s] going to make a ton of money on this.
[6186.159s] Yeah, go for it. It&#39;s okay. It&#39;s a
[6188.159s] trade. It&#39;s not one that I want to hold
[6189.6s] for a while, and I don&#39;t think you&#39;re
[6190.639s] going to get a double off it. Um,
[6194.8s] next
[6205.84s] question on uh, Crown Castle. Just be
[6209.36s] patient with this, Theo. This is this is
[6212.08s] just an interest rate play. It&#39;s going
[6213.76s] to work. They have a moat. Um, you don&#39;t
[6216.96s] want to over complicate things with
[6218.32s] that. And then got Paul
[6222.48s] And that&#39;s it. We&#39;ll be back next week.
[6224.96s] Same time, different place. In the
[6226.4s] meantime, make it a great one. Bye for
[6228.96s] now. Thanks for tuning in.
