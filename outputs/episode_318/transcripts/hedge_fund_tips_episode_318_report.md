**Tom's Current Market Conviction: Cautiously Optimistic → 6/10** 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥☆☆☆☆

- AI trade is overheated in certain names.
- Retail investors are chasing the story while institutions are selling.
- Potential accounting issues with Nvidia raise concerns.
- Opportunities exist in unloved sectors with improving fundamentals.
- Market correction is possible, but long-term opportunities remain.

## Macro Thesis & Key Data Points
The market is in a state of rotation, with crowded trades like AI potentially facing a correction. Opportunities exist in unloved sectors like consumer discretionary, healthcare, and energy. The US consumer remains resilient, and a potential Fed easing cycle could further support these sectors. Emerging markets, particularly China, offer value. A focus on margin of safety and businesses with improving fundamentals is crucial.

| Indicator | Value | Tom's Interpretation |
|-----------|-------|----------------------|
| Fund Manager Survey - Consumer Discretionary Allocation | Cut by the most on record, lowest since December 2022 | Contrarian indicator suggesting opportunity in consumer discretionary stocks. "Betting against the US consumer when they have jobs rarely works out." |
| Fund Manager Survey - Cash Levels | Dropped to 3.7%, lowest in 15 years | Implies yields are going to compress which will help rates and defensives. |
| Healthcare Sector PE vs. S&P 500 | Lowest relative multiple since 2009 | A once in a 25-year opportunity in healthcare. |
| Energy Sector Market Cap Weight in S&P 500 | Down to 2020 lows | Opportunity in energy services, particularly National Oil Well Varco (NOV). |

## Featured Company Deep Dives
### VF Corp – 8 Conviction
VF Corp is a turnaround story with improving fundamentals, a strong management team (Bracken Daryl), and a clear path to margin expansion. The market is currently undervaluing the company's potential due to short-term macro noise.

**Key Metrics:**
- Revenues up 2% year-on-year
- Adjusted operating margins expanded by 40 basis points year on year to 11.8%
- Net debt down 1.5 billion or 21% year-on-year
- Medium-term targets of 55% gross margins and 10% operating margins remain firmly on track

**Valuation / Target:** Consensus still modeling a little over 8% operating margins for fiscal year 2028, presenting upside.
**Action:** Buy. "We sit on our hands, stay patient, and let Turnaround Bracken, or growth bracken as he prefers, do what he does best."

### Canada Goose – 7 Conviction
Canada Goose is a four-season brand with record free cash flow and revenues, but a low stock price. The company is cleaning up its inventory position and has a strong direct-to-consumer business.

**Key Metrics:**
- Q2 direct to consumer revenues up 21.8%
- Gross margin expanding 110 basis points year-on-year to 62.4%
- Net debt fell to 77 million
