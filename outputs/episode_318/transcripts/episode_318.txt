Welcome to Hedge Fund Tips with Tom Hayes. I'm Tom Hayes and this is your 318th videocast podcast for the week ending November 20th, 2025. We got a lot of great stuff to cover today, but as always, family first. Good to be back in California after a long long trip. Uh first and foremost, Annabelle had a meet this weekend and swam personal best in the 100 IM, 50 back, and 100 free. She was excited about going 55 seconds in her 100 free and 103 in her 100 IM. Congratulations. Uh this is uh me and Mimi hanging out last night. There's the Christmas tree. Uh and then we went to dinner. Uh this is some extra pictures from Scotland at the castle. Was there for some business strategy. Absolutely amazing time. Yes, that's me in a dress. Uh, and uh, that's the castle, which was a lot of fun. Then in uh, Edinburg, this was the Johnny Walker store. And the reason I bring this up, one, I was getting a gift for someone, but two, this is owned by Dagio. And it was such an incredible experience. It was like an Apple store. Um, and what was cool about it, I guess I don't have it in the photos, is they had this machine. So, you buy a bottle as a gift. uh Johnny Walker or whatever. And then you you know they said you want to get a custom message engraved and you bring it over to this machine and uh you know the host that I was bringing it to. I just you know wrote a message in the glass had it wrapped right in the store and was able to bring it. It was absolutely phenomenal. Uh which is there's Dagio. Here's here's Vans doing some channel checks. It was like 8 in the morning though, so they weren't uh open yet. Uh oh yeah, here's the machine right here where they etch it right on site, which is pretty cool. You can watch it being etched uh in the machine, which is great. Uh giving gifts. Uh here are some more photos from Edinburg, or as they say, Edinburghough. Uh and uh I guess they stole a British telephone uh booth there. Uh then I got a chance to, this is from last week, uh talk with my friend Kenny Pulcari on Yahoo Finance. We're going to tune in here. Welcome to Trader Talk, where we dish out the latest Wall Street buzz to keep your portfolio sizzling. I'm Kenny Pulkari, and I'm coming to you live from the Yahoo Finance headquarters here in the heart of New York City, a global hub where deals are made, fortunes are built, and the next market move is always just around the corner. Coming up, I'm going to share my thoughts on the AI bubble, or maybe not. Chat with my good friend Tom Hayes, and share my baked talion with peas, ponchetta, and a creamy bashameal sauce. It is outstanding. Now, let's just jump into my big take. Every time markets explode around a new technology, the comparisons start flying. This feels like the dot bubble, they say, pointing to soaring valuations, overhyped startups, and wild speculation. Sure, the AI rally has some of that froth, but let's be clear, this is not pets.com 2.0. This is the next industrial revolution. In fact, I call it the fourth industrial revolution. The dotcom era was built on potential, on what the internet might one day become. Back then, companies were raising billions on buzzwords and business plans with absolutely zero revenues. Today, AI isn't a theory. It's already here, embedded in everything from healthcare and logistics to energy grids and financial systems. The infrastructure demand and cash flow are real. Now, look at the difference in scale. When the dotcom bubble popped in 2000, global internet adoption was under 10%. Today, AI is being deployed by trillion dollar companies with decades of profit history. Nvidia, Microsoft, Amazon, Apple, these aren't startups burning cash. Oh no, they are global titans building the picks and the shovels of the next economy. And here's the key point. The AI story isn't hype. It's about productivity. It's not simply new software. It's a force multiplier for every industry. AI doesn't just add value, it compounds it. It's cutting costs, improving decision-making, and accelerating innovation at a pace that we have never seen. That's not a speculative promise. That's margin expansion in motion. Now, will we see some shakeouts? 100% absolutely. Some startups will vanish. Some valuations will crash. But that's how every technological revolution evolves. Creative destruction is the toll we pay for progress. The winners that survive will define the next generation of market leadership. Just like Amazon and Google did after the last bubble burst. The bottom line, the dotcom bubble was about possibility. The AI boom is about execution. This isn't the birth of a fad. It's the rewiring of the global economy. And if you're still waiting for the bubble to pop before you get involved, you might just miss the next decade of growth. Okay, my next guest is my very good friend. He's a powerhouse in the world of hedge funds. He's the founder and chairman of managing member of Great Hill Capital here in New York City and California where he's been at the forefront of long short equity investing and he's known for delivering real actionable ideas for traders and investors. He also hosts a popular hedge fund tips with Tom Hayes. It's a video cast and podcast. A go-to resource for anyone trying to make sense of these markets. A Columbia University alum and dedicated community leader. He's a dynamic and influential voice in finance. And I get to call him my friend. Please join me in welcoming Tom Hayes back to the show. Tom, it is such a pleas. You have to be here. You have no idea. It's perfect because I think you know there's a lot to talk about. you and I have I think the last time you run was at the very beginning part of of this podcast back in January, February. So, it's exciting to have you back now that we've gone, you know, six or seven months into the not only into the podcast, but into kind of the economic cycle, what we've been through over the last six and seven months, you know. So, let's just let's just put this out in the open at the very moment. In your opinion, is the AI trade too crowded? Oo, that's that's a different question than is the AI trade a bubble? Okay. I don't think it's a bubble. I think we're in the early to midstages and I agree. I think in the short term it might be a little bit overheated. Okay. Uh you know it's interesting stat uh the hyperscalers capex to operating cash flow is now 60%. Do you know what other industry has that level of capex? I don't. Big oil. Uh-huh. Now big oil trades at 15 times earnings. The hypers scale tra trade at 33. Now I'm not comparing the businesses but what I'm saying is the free cash flow of this group in aggregate since Q4 of 2024 till Q1 of next year is down 43% because of all this investment. Right? and the market is saying we're going to give you time to see the return on investment except in the case of Meta. No, no time for you. Okay. So, I think we're going to see more instances of that. And even if you look at this great earning season, Kenny, the biggest and it has been so far fairly good earning season. Yeah. The biggest detractor was communication services because of Meta and because of Netflix. Okay. Those are two two big misses in the Mag 7, right? uh and believe it or not, financials has been the largest contributor, right? Uh because they they had uh a big big contribution in terms of exceeding expectations, right? But let me ask you, let's just go back to for one minute and talk about I want to talk about the meta story because I think that's interesting what they did to Meta last week when they you know, I didn't necessarily think that the report was so horrible, but they didn't, you know, it was priced to perfection at the that that the miss that they had suddenly caused everyone to say, I got to get out. They sold the stock up what 11 or 12% in one day. Yeah, 11 and a half% I think. Well, here's the thing. When when you're in the flavor, you know, you've been around. It's the Wall Street fashion show. Okay. Flavor of the month. Flavor of the month right now is AI. And when you're in these trades, you know, Palanteer is going to report tonight. Palanteer might be great, okay? And it might keep going up. Here's the thing, though. There was an upgrade on the stock and and at Wed Bush. And we we know Dan, brilliant guy. He's got a home run, billion dollars in in his ETF. Dan Ies. Dan. and he's upgraded to a trillion dollar valuation and he certainly could will pro I don't know if he'll be right or he won't but here's what I know they're going to report a billion dollars in revenue this quarter not a billion dollars in profits so last time I checked there's four quarters in a year that's $4 billion in revenue right 250 times sales that works until it doesn't because you know what everything all the great things that Palanteer is doing and is going to do in the future right the question is how many years of that are you paying for today. Amazon, not to compare, this is not like a bubble. Amazon did everything they promised us that they would do in 2000 and more, right? The problem was in 2000, you were paying for it as if it had happened. And that's why over the next four years from 2000 to 2004, even though their fundamentals got better, revenues went up, cash flow went up, earnings went up, the stock went down 80%. Amazon did. It did. Right. Right. And so now the question is, let's talk about Meta. Where do you think Meta goes after after what we just heard? You think it continues to trade back a little bit? You think it kind of finds its stability and starts to move ahead? I'm not a Meta. Listen, I don't own Meta. I never did. I was not a Facebook person. I never was. Um, so so I'm not in that game, right? I I got I got no skin in the Meta game. Yeah. But I thought it was very interesting that after those earnings came out and I didn't necessarily think that the earnings were that horrible but they punished the stock really bad. It it's similar to when he did the massive investment in the metaverse in the metaverse. And you know the question we have to look at is all of this spending offensive or defensive. Right. Okay. And do they have a choice in the matter to or are they afraid of seating seating uh seating share effectively if they don't make all these investments. So that's when you look at capex levels at the same level as oil. You know, if you remember the stories of these multiples, what was the thing? They're capex light, right? That's no longer the case. So, you know, when you see cash flow deteriorating, on the one hand, you could say the fact that they're buying back less shares and investing tells you that they had a better return on capital through investing in AI or at least they believe they're going to have a better return on capital than in buying back their own shares. For years, it was buy back your own shares because you can invest at a higher rate of return. So on that side, it's positive. on the side of Facebook has yet to show or meta has yet to show the return on invested capital just like when they were investing in the metaverse and then all of a sudden he cried uncle and he said okay the stock's down too much we're going to stop spending on metaverse and all of a sudden the stock recovered right I don't know that we're at that point you know from a trading perspective you say do I buy uh meta today sell meta today I don't think in those terms uh but for me I think there are ways to invest in the benefits of AI uh without taking the risk i.e. having a greater margin of safety where you can sleep well at night and put large amounts of money to work not worrying if god forbid one of these companies training at 200 times sales misses by 1% the stock doesn't go down 1%. Yeah. No, it doesn't. It goes down 50%. Cuz it's like yelling fire in a crowded theater. Exactly. Right. Which is always the part that's interesting to me. You know, people will say, you know, but it w but it missed it by you know a small fraction. Yeah, I know. But it was so overvalued to begin with that it creates that angst in the market. So it works until it doesn't. And by the way, I'm not saying my framework is the only framework. I'm very good at one framework, okay? It doesn't mean you can't make a lot of money buying momentum stocks and riding them and buying breakouts and doing all the things that that momentum uh traders or investors do. That's a great it's just a different discipline, right? You know, like one guy's an orthopedist, one guy's a heart surgeon. You know, you don't try to have the heart surgeon do, you know, you don't want the heart surgeon doing my knee replacement. I don't want the the knee replacement guy doing my heart operation either. So, because I have one framework doesn't mean the other frameworks are wrong or right. They're different. Right. Yeah. And and they work for people who are wired to do that. So, when God was handing out FOMO jeans, he didn't give me one. Okay. And I like I like to buy businesses that are down in price, fundamentals are improving, play the divergence, rinse, repeat. Listen, and just so the audience understands, when Tom says he wasn't given a FOMO gene, that it's that fear of missing out gene, right? When people get excited and they're not in, they think they've missed it and they all run right in is typically also the wrong time to do it. But that's a whole another conversation. In any event, hold on one second. We'll take a quick break. We'll be right back. Okay, so Tom, we're back and thank you. And we just ended up with that the whole FOMO conversation with I thought was very very funny and apppropo. Listen, let's talk about retail versus institution in some of these AI names. Who do you think is really driving the flow into the big leaders? Is it institutional or is it in fact retail because I know we've gotten some very interesting retail data that you know that we're going to discuss. Yeah, institutions have been net sellers in the last few weeks. Retails have been aggressive buyers, right? uh and it's the longest 25 week streak of retail buying uh call options and the the slug of the massive concentration is expiring in November. It's unlikely those people get paid. Okay. So explain that that concept explain what that concept means so that the listener understands. Okay. So retail is chasing the story. Okay. Uh that's not to say investor institutions always get it right because they were net sellers in the hole and they missed the whole ride up and retail has been basically right since uh co right okay but when you see this concentration of call premium that signals froth okay uh and when you when you have that amount of premium that that are written by dealers that are written by sophisticated investors that are doing option pricing it's very rare that you see all of those late money high implied volatility calls pay out. Okay, usually those people don't get paid. So what does that mean? It means that the likelihood is between now and expiration, you probably see a little bit of volatility or or prices stop going up. So so the bulk of those expire worthless. So the sellers made the money on the calls, not the buyers. Right. And so the expiration would be the third Friday of the month. Correct. Right. So that's uh that's two weeks from now. Yeah. And then you know, you look at even active investment managers, they had 35% equity exposure in the hole in April. Now they're 90%. There's a lot of year end chase here, right? So, so that's one data point. Then we had the data point about uh uh the investor survey, wasn't it? Saying that yeah, 44% bullish, which is the highest in a couple of months. Okay. So, a lot of these data points while they they appear, oh god, look at how bullish it is. All these people are in can actually be a contra indicator. Correct. Correct. You want to you want to look for extremes uh and when everyone's crowded on one side of the boat. So when you asked me is AI a bubble I said no it's not not a bubble but but but there might be a concentration in in a a few names you know if AI is going to work as well as everyone anticipated the 493 are going to be the beneficiaries and the mag 7 are going to be the cost centers right cuz the 493 are going to get margin expansion if this works if it works and I understand that it's working it is working of course you know you know if I got to go through uh 30 articles about what's happening before I I go do a show I can get through that in an hour versus, you know, a day. That's right. Listen, I'm also in the camp and I think you're in the same camp. We're very much in my mind at the beginning of this story. Like, like I still think we're in the batting cage, I don't think the game has begun, honestly, yet. Even if you take the model of uh the dot boom, right? Um we're now realizing what that was. Now, the question is, did do you get a massive hiccup in innings four through seven before you get through seven to nine? And the answer is no one knows. Yeah, you don't know. No, no one knows. But as far as uh where is this going in terms of quality of life and implementation, super early days. Question is what do you pay for that? Right. And that's going to vary yearbyear, right? Okay. So, let's talk about second derivatives of AI. And in your mind, where do you think where do you see some of the opportunities beyond maybe the obvious mega cap name that we've already talked about, right? Uh uh in infrastructure and chips and software. Do you have a kind of a a short list in your head? Well, we've had four major AI plays that didn't look like AI plays until everyone figured out they were AI plays. Okay. One is called Alibaba. You couldn't give this stock away because it was China was uninvestable. The thing went down. We started buying above 100. It went down to 60. We bought every share we could buy until our fingers bled. Not because we're geniuses, because the thing had $80 billion of cash on the balance sheet. Number one thing with the turnaround, Kenny, is solveny risk. Okay. Not only did they have 80 billion, they were generating 25 billion a year of free cash flow, controlled e-commerce, controlled the cloud business, uh has 33% of Ant Financial, largest financial services business in Asia. Oh, and by the way, they have this thing called AI, which is growing at triple digits a year, and you couldn't give the stock away. So, for us, that was kind of a no-brainer. And with these unloved stocks, in the short term, it's a voting machine based on emotion. The emotion was China's uninvestable. It's communist. We're going to decouple. They're going to get delisted. All the nonsense that got people out of their stock at the exact wrong time. And then when it turns, it goes up overnight to 180. Tripled off the lows in less than a year, right? And it's probably going to double again over the next 3 to 5 years as the AI story actualizes versus theorizes. Um, then Intel. Okay. Intel you couldn't give away. It was a dead dead horse. Right. Right. Okay. So, 1819 bucks. I look under the hood, I was like, "Oh, wait. It's in book value is $22. You know, if they liquidate the damn thing tomorrow, I make three a bucks." So, my downside's protected, right? Their legacy business on the CPUs, we were in a trough of the cycle. The boring stuff that goes in computers and servers was uh worth 40 45 bucks a share. So, I got a double if AI fails and the fabs fail. And then uh if they actually produce advanced chips, which Nvidia needs more than anything in the world, uh then I could have a five beggger plus, right? So downside's protected, upside is is good and possibly unlimited if the story plays out, right? And it didn't hurt then that the government got behind it. That was key. But but if you if you thought about it, the government had no choice. It doesn't matter if it was the current administration, the previous administration. The only difference between the last administration and this administration is the last administration says, "We're going to give you $9 billion and we want nothing." Right? Trump says, "We're going to give you $9 billion." says, "Oh, and by the way, we're getting stock because that's the taxpayers's money and I'm going to the taxpayer is going to wind up making a five bagger on this thing." That's right. Okay. And when when you have Donald Trump rooting for a stock to go up, that's a good thing because you know how many Boeing planes he sold? Imagine how many Intel chips he's going to sell because he's got skin in the game. Yeah. Well, we He's got it, but we've got We look This is a guy that doesn't take a salary. That's right. Why Why is he doing this? Right. So, Right. It's a good thing. He doesn't make a He doesn't take a salary and he's making deal after deal after deal. I mean, honestly, for the benefit of who? For the benefit of the country. Correct. And every time you turn around, it is a new deal after new deal. Over the weekend, they announced that new deal again with China about the rare earth, how China's now completely taken those export controls off and they've come to the table and whatever you need and here you go. Yeah. I think it's amazing. Yeah. And by the way, I mean, it's it's it's not dissimilar. It's not because they wanted to make a deal. It's because they had to. to make a deal. And it's the same with intel. So if you get into these situations like Boeing, right? A year ago, planes are falling out of the sky, doors are falling off. You can't give away the thing. Okay, so Southwest goes to Boeing. I hate you. You're screwing up my business. Okay, go to Airbus. Your next plane will be ready in 25 years in one month. And by the way, you won't be in business by then, right? So, you know, buying int buying Boeing at $135 was not rocket science, right? So, we do simple things. We don't have to predict the future. You're unbelievable. Listen, let's just talk about maybe really quickly because then because then we're coming to the end. This retails new new handbook maybe on how how either retail or traders are using ETFs and social media to pile into or maybe hedge some of their AI exposure. Do you have a sense of that? Yeah, it's just going to exacerbate the moves. Okay. So, this earning season, earnings are good. 64% reported uh 10.7% earnings growth versus 8% expectations. Yeah, but of the ones that reported, we have like an 84% beat rate. 83% beat rate on the bottom line, 79% uh on the top line. All is good. So your question is the retail exacerbates moves. The average beat is up 30 basis points. The average miss is down 6.4%. Right? Okay. So this is what what happens in the in the short term. voting machine based on emotion, based on people crowding in, crowding out, based on social media, all of these things, whether it's AI, whether it's this or that, will never replace fully human judgment. It'll allow us to assimilate more. Agreed. But, uh, that short-term emotionalism, there's always going to be humans making making the end decision. The people that are going to benefit are going to be the people who know what they own and play the time arbitrage game. If you got a business where the fundamentals are improving and the price has deteriorated and you can figure out that why the business will continue to improve. That's how you can make a lot of money. And a computer or AI uh is going to be more inclined to chase the short-term fluctuations. Well, it does. When the algorithms kick in and they take a good stock and they dislocate the price because there's nervousness and and big asset managers are raising money and and and the algorithms are going into a sell mode. If the story fundamentally hasn't changed, there's a huge opportunity. Yeah. And a lot of it, the benefits come from structural, which is why I never do private deals because I don't think the private markets will ever offer the opportunities in terms of price relative to value that the public markets do from time to time because structurally active managers can't show certain stocks on their books at the end of the quarter because it went down. Even if they love the company and they think the company's going to do well, they they're forced to sell it because it's it's about survival and and keeping their jobs. They're forced to sell it. And that's what they call window dressing at the end of the quarter, right? They sell the names that they can't have on their on their books, but and they all buy the names that they want to have and they buy the ones that are up. They buy the ones that are already up. But then at the end of the month or at the end of the quarter, look look what we own. This is why we bought it yesterday. We just saw it at the end of October. It's the end of the year for mutual funds. They were doing all their tax laws selling. So whatever was down this year got down more. Now you're going to see them rebound huge in November, December. In November, December. So Tom, it's always a pleasure to talk to you. I am so I want you to come back. You know, every six months we have this conversation one way or the other. Thank you because now and we're back. Uh and then this morning bright and early had a chance to talk with Brian Sazi, Brooke Deama uh on all things Nvidia, Walmart, um VF Corp, and a couple others, Intel, etc. We're going to listen in here. Tom, are you on board with that? Well, I think the big breakthrough this this quarter was supply, not demand. Demand has never been a problem for Nvidia. The key was supply. They had been capped at $4 billion per quarter uh of revenue growth since Q2 of 2024. Even last quarter contracted, it was down to two uh two billion uh two quarterly revenue growth. Now you saw a huge jump of 10 billion revenue growth in the quarter. And what did Jensen attribute it to? To new US wafer production is running and partners are ready to build. So what does that tell you, Brian? It tells you that the US facilities for Taiwan semiconductor are humming and partners are ready to build. What does that tell you about Intel? Even including today's pre-market gains, uh Nvidia is up 43% year-to date, but Intel is up 85% year-to- date. That is the dark horse. This is the key providing the supply for Nvidia. Uh is exciting to see because that they were really capacity constrained from Taiwan Semiconductor for so many quarters, which is why their growth rate was declining. This is certainly a big breakthrough. Somehow capacity and supply has come on and it's come on in the United States. Big deal for Nvidia. Jim, is it AI trade back on? If uh you liked Palunteer but didn't want to get involved now that it's well below the 52- week high, do you use this Nvidia report to get in? Uh not for me. Listen, Nvidia is up, you know, 3, four, 5%. It's back to the level it was 10 days ago. Uh I, you know, I wouldn't chase it. I would say in terms of the general market, this is part for the course. The last time we were on, we said, look, in years you get these 15% plus draw downs mid year. We got 20% in April. Uh, and then you reach all-time highs. The secondary correction averages over the last 50 years 6.5%. Well, guess what? That's effectively what we had intraday. Get some relief in the general indices. Do you chase AI? Do you chase Palunteer still at uh uh, you know, 125 time sales? Uh, not for us. Not to say it won't work as a trading vehicle, uh, but you know, price is what you pay, value is what you get. We like a higher margin of safety. Kim, um, I don't know if it's a bell weather on the outlook for tech, but I will say their execution is crushing it. You know, a lot of people see Walmart earnings and they say, "Oh, wealthier people are shopping at Walmart. The economy must be bad." I wouldn't make that assumption. I think they're executing a lot better from a technology standpoint. If you look at uh their e-commerce business was up double digits 27%. So the wealthier uh customer goes to their website, they get uh great delivery, they get great access. I think Target uh by contrast execution has been very poor and it's reflected in their numbers. Their traffic is down. Uh Lowe's and Home Depot, same thing. A contrast to what we're seeing in Walmart. So they are executing the store revamps. They're they're nicer stores, the e-commerce growth, uh everything that they're bringing to the table. It doesn't necessarily mean that the economy is bad. It just means that they're doing a better job at reaching out to all demographics. Uh both the poor demographics have done okay that the snap hit them a little bit, but now those payments are coming back at the low end and the upper end they're appealing to them in ways that they want to shop with nicer stores with better e-commerce and employing that technology that you referenced. Yeah, I have no problem going to Walmart by all means right now. Tom Macy's is a growth stock. You like it? Yeah. Well, uh, this was a case of it's so bad, it's good. Uh, this was a left for dead real estate play that activists had been circling around for years trying to get them to just close the stores and sell off the real estate. So, there was always a downside protection if it was liquidated. Now, they've actually got someone in there who can execute. You had same same store sales growth last quarter of up about 1%, some store revamp, some store closings, some uh better execution. Obviously, they have the higherend Bloomingdales, which that consumer has generally held up. Uh so, yes, it's it's up a lot off the lows, but uh we're basically back to the future. I mean, this is below levels it was years ago. I wouldn't bet the ranch on this one, Jim. What uh what is amazing to me is we've been talking about Walmart all morning long. You like into the holiday season. I like, you know, it's interesting. The Bank of America fund manager survey uh had consumer discretionary stocks. managers cut them by the by the most on record. I think there's a lot of opportunity in the discretionary stocks. I maybe one step removed. I like the turnaround story in VF Corp with Bracken Daryl. That's Timberland, Northface, and Vans. Vans has been the drag. It's starting to show signs of positivity. Uh we don't own Nike, but I think Nike is a turnaround play you could start to pay attention to in the consumer distra discretionary place and some of the uh restaurant stock. So, I wouldn't I wouldn't bet against the consumer. Uh we do like consumer discretionary here because it's been hit so hard. As far as straight up retail, we're going to take a pass on that. Yeah, I like uh Bracken as well. He's uh he's done some good work there to refocus the company, sell off some assets. All right, then Jerome Pal and the Federal Reserve. Well, it's interesting today for sure this is a huge theme and as Jim pointed out, the waiting in the S&P is so large for the S&P to go back up. This group, this theme has to work. But if we look at the Fed, the odds of a rate cut in December, they've actually jumped from 30 to 42% in the last day, which is surprising to me. So that doesn't hurt either. Uh part of that probably related to the jobs report, etc. Uh the unemployment rate ticking up, but uh as as it relates to today and probably the next few days, if we get follow through in the AI trade, we're going to get follow through in the indices for sure. Brooke, weigh in. And we're back. Uh reminder, we'll see a few of you uh or more in Sarasota, the Ritz Carlton. If you want to go, you can still get registered. Just uh go to hedge funips.com and search money show. You'll find the one December uh 1st through 3rd in Sarasota at the Ritz Carlton or you can just go to their website and do that. Uh quote of the week, uh most people get interested in stocks when everyone else is. The time to get interested is when no one else is. You can't buy what's popular and do well. That's from Warren Buffett. Uh the GOAT, greatest of all time. Many of you have been sending in your photos. Um you know, we continue to encourage you. Get a hat, get a mug, get a hoodie, whatever. Uh because that's how we spread the word. And as this thing keeps growing, we're going to keep um uh uh providing it for non-clients. And uh you guys have been doing an absolutely incredible job. Uh the hats and the the shirts and all that stuff create a lot of buzz and you can just tell them about it and help us grow. Let's look at markets here. We got um now SNP down I think around almost 7% peak to trough. Um, people looked at me crazy when I started talking about that several weeks back, but we're kind of in the sweet spot here. Uh, NASDAQ down 8% peaked to trough. So, we were making this assertion when everyone was exceedingly bullish. Now, the bearishness has come in. So, we want to kind of look at, are we close? I can tell you I was putting a decent amount of money to work today and uh a lot of the names that are unrelated to AI etc. Um lot of lot of great stuff to do. Does that mean it's the bottom? Let's take a look at some of the internal stuff. It is normal after a 15% or more correction that then goes on to make new highs that the mean secondary correction is 6.4%. So we are right there. Uh and in looking at some of the names that we bought, it really doesn't matter if they go lower. They're perfectly incredible places to buy for the long term to get our double pluses uh in three or four years, which is what we look for to some take two, some take five, but uh we want to be in it for about a a couple of years. um the albamaro which was absolutely on a tear yesterday. Uh I don't know if it was by dumb luck or by um just kind of doing this forever. We took all of our option spreads off. We made between three and 4x on the album options uh in a relatively short period of time. Uh quicker than we expected. And the stock though, for those of you who think I'm a a genius for doing that yesterday, we we own 100% of the stock. We have not sold one share, nor do we intend to. Um uh but when we get that kind of parabolic move in that short a period of time, the way we we can benefit from that is is in the case when we have spreads and and take that off now wait versus you know wait another year and a half to get you know 8x on it. Uh take three or four off now three or 4x off now and then the stock we're going to continue to hold for a long time. We believe that is just uh well it's it's obviously already up more than double but uh uh has a lot more upside to it. So we remain fully in the stock and you you know that we've done that with a number of stocks. We made a lot of money on the Boeing options uh still hold the stock. We will hold that long-term uh etc. So we we've done that many Baba was the same thing. We took off between six and 7x haven't sold a share of stock. So that is is the name of the game. Um the 10day put call it is getting elevated to the point where you see toward troughs. Um so we're keeping an eye on that. Here's the NYSE 10% volume index. It's kind of at the level where you see near bottoms, but it could also go a lot lower. So it's at negative 100. It could go to -200 before you get a bottom. Doesn't mean it has to. Same with this 1% EMA advanced decline ratio. you know, that can be a point where you get bottoms, but it could go lower. So, these things are getting close to worn out on the downside, but not necessarily at guaranteed inflection levels. So, you keep an eye on it. Uh, we're going to talk quite a bit more about Nvidia today. uh some issues on the accounts receivable, some issues on some of the accounting things that the market's starting to call into question uh that uh may portend for a little bit more downside in the near term, particularly on the crowded trades. You're seeing crypto unwinding a little bit. You're seeing uh Palunteer uh down pretty big off the peak from when we were talking about it with uh uh Kenny and even well before that as you know. um this intermediate term midcap volume momentum again it's down but it's not really yet at an extreme you would see at an absolute low these are all getting closer whether it's the MLEN summation um you know look you could see active investment managers we said last week at 100% or a week and a half ago whenever it was because we were doing it early uh sure enough they bought at the top they they're now puking down. Um, which is why we're seeing individual discrete opportunities in the market to buy, but not a wholesale buy everything type of environment. I mean, even today with Nvidia up 5% when I was on with Szy and he's like, "Would you buy it now?" I'm like, "No, price is what you pay. Value is what you get." Like, and then sure enough, the thing rolled right over an hour later. So um uh same with Palunteer. Uh here's the bullish percent S snp. So this is the bullish percent meaning uh the point and figure chart. We don't use any of that, but we do use this as an indicator. This is down. It doesn't mean it can't, you know, you'll only have 40% bullish. I mean the definite bottoms are when you get down to 10 to 20%, but you could get bounces off these levels. So, we're kind of in no man's land. And that's why you have to take it on a company by company basis. And just know that as long as you're buying well below intrinsic value, even if it goes lower in the short term, who cares in the long term? Uh if it's clear that they're doubles or triples, what's the difference? Uh national uh the NASDAQ Mlen oscillator uh -50. This could go to 80 before a clear clear bounce. the NASDAQ MLEN summation index. Again, this is negative -400. You know, you could see this down to negative a,000. So, I I think there's a little bit more to do in the NASDAQ uh in particular, which will bring down the S&P a little bit, but um you know, some of these are washed out enough where you could get a bounce, but it looks like there's a little bit more work to do. Even the uh NYSE MLEN summation index, this does look washed out on a day basis. this uh advanced decline volume on the NY. This is down to negative 3,000. You always get a short-term bounce. So that would in that would imply we definitely do bounce tomorrow. Whether the total correction is over at 7% for the S&P or 6 and a half and 8% for the NASDAQ. Uh unclear if you're buying indices. If you're buying companies and you're not putting to work on a one by one basis, then you're missing something. I think there's going to be a little bit more work to do here in coming days and weeks. Uh bounce tomorrow probably, although I'm not sure if people want to go long into the weekend, but my guess is bounce tomorrow. Uh VIX is starting to ease off. Then it went back up to 26. So, uh so that's that. Okay. Uh here are some things I wanted to cover today on Yahoo, but we didn't have time. Um expectations, this was from the fund manager survey. Expectations for emerging markets to outperform again next year even though they've outperformed already this year 2 to1 relative to the US I think are probably rational because more and more money is going to flow into China and the valuations are still relatively low uh meaningfully lower. Uh US equities seen trailing other regions over the next decade. So they have them at emerging markets being the greatest performance of 11% compounded versus US at 7% compounded. I you know I I I like the direction. I'm not sure about the spread. Uh managers cut disc consumer discretionary stocks by the most on record. Uh we continue to like that that trade. We did um you know for those of you who have been following us for a while, you know that we have been looking aggressively for one more way to get exposure to health care because its relative performance was uh at 25-y year lows and waiting in the S&P and all that stuff. And we had the biotech basket that's come up quite quite a bit. U Baxter hasn't worked yet, but we've added to it and we're comfortable with that rebound in 2026 and we think it's going to be very very aggressive with the new CEO and everything else. All they need is the announcement that one announcement and the thing's going to be up 15 bucks um on the pumps. And then uh we added one more uh stock in healthcare which we'll probably be talking about in the next few weeks. We have some more money uh big money has come in to uh in the last few days to go to work from existing clients. Uh and those clients over uh coming in over 5 million can come in intraquarter. So we're putting money to work in the new ideas and in uh existing accounts where there's space. And we also uh know that we've been looking for more consumer discretionary particularly in the restaurant space. We did get exposure to a new name in the restaurant space which we will be um uh probably announcing in the next few weeks uh after uh all the new money is uh put to work. Uh for the existing clients that have space in the accounts, you you you've seen this show up in your accounts. Uh for the ones that don't, if you're, you know, in an IRA and you you have uh no margin capacity, um uh you feel free if you want to know the names to just email us and we'll give you the the two names. If you want to either add money to your account or um uh get some exposure on your own, feel free to do that. um one standard deviation below historic waiting for staples and defensives opportunity. I think the defenses are going to start to get bid. You did see even uh you know backers, diagos, a lot of these things positive on a down day. That's that's normal. Healthcare etc. Uh global so that's uh uh 16% underweight one standard deviation below normal on the staples and defensives. two standard deviations below normal on the energy. Uh you know we have uh national oil wellvarco and uh comtock which have all been you know moving up a decent amount in the last few weeks. We're not putting new money to work in comtock because our original basis was uh between $8 and $9. Uh on national oil varco, it's come up a lot off the bottom. So we'd probably look for a little more weakness before we put new money to work there. Uh defensive sectors market cap weighted. So you can see defensive sectors haven't been uh this low in waiting since 2000 and prior to that 1980. And what's interesting is you see from 1980 to 1990, which was a big bull run, uh, defensives did fine even in a a bullant market. Same thing with 2000 to 2008. So I think you're going to see defensives absolutely cook. Clorox was up a lot today. That's one to keep in mind. We've got the Dagios. Hormel I think was even green today. forward healthcare uh PE sector versus the S&P 500 lowest relative multiple since 2009. Uh this is the relative performance. You got to go all the way back. This is a once in a 25-y year opportunity in healthcare, which is why we got a third position, meaningful position, and we expressed it as a stock replacement versus a stock so we could get meaningfully more exposure for less money than a normalsized position. Uh, and we thought that made sense given the other exposures. Um, so that's that. Moving along, let's go down to the market data. So, PayPal did a um hosted meetings with Alex Chris. They talked about uh PayPal's very well positioned to win buy now pay later and Agentic, two important secular growth areas that are developing quickly, causing PayPal to invest short-term to drive habituation and win big long-term. Buy now pay later seeing good momentum at scale growing 20% plus from being behind the PayPal button and CEO believes there's incremental growth to grab by investing in placement upstream on the product page. Investing in placement will step up in Q4 2025 and early 2026 and be treated as a contra revenue item that reduces TMD on Aentic. Expect PayPal to invest in incentivizing customers to choose PayPal as their default wallet for Agentic payments starting in 2026. also treated as contra revenue. Magnitude of investment spend is still to be determined and PayPal doesn't expect these investments to turn uh TMD negative in 2026. So, we'll be watching closely to see how this develops. Um, PayPal believes Agentic will be significant. Uh, question is timing. CEO believes PayPal brings a lot to the Agentic table as evidenced by deals with Google, Open AI, and Perplexity. These deals will allow PayPal to be the orchestration layer for merchants to have one connection to PayPal for their merchant cataloges to be distributed to LLMs. On the other on the consumer side, Chris believes wallets are going to win in Agentic and PayPal's scale as staged wallet and authentication authenticated consumers that have loaded multiple payment instruments, debit, credit, buy now pay later, AC, crypto can bring intelligent payment decision-making to agents complete with buyer protection plus receipt and package tracking. Um, blah blah blah blah blah. So, that was that. Um, we've been buying PayPal uh pretty aggressively in the last two days. Um, here's Nvidia's movement today. Went straight up 450 billion in market cap and gave it all back away by by lunchtime. And I want to talk about some of these things. It was funny that a reporter called me today. Why is the market uh doing whatever? And I said, you know, the Fed person, Cook, spoke and warned about private credit and the market being in a bubble, blah blah blah. Uh, that was part of it. But the other thing I said that stood out for me from PayPal's earnings, I had a chance to read them after um going on Yahoo, is the accounts receivable. Uh, pretty dramatic increase. And a friend of mine sent me over this article from Substack. And basically what it says is on November 20th, trading algorithms identified what may become the largest accounting fraud in technology history. Not in months or years, but in 18 hours. This is the story of how artificial intelligence discovered that the AI boom itself was built on phantom revenue. Okay, obviously a sensational title. I think there's probably, you know, 15% validity to some of this. Uh but the key points that this author makes is the receivables anomaly hidden on page 8 of Nvidia's uh 10Q buried in the standard financial statement lies a number that algorithmic systems flagged within minutes of the release accounts receivable of 33.4 billion which is mindboggling because that was the number that stood out to me in terms cuz like they were only growing $4 billion a quarter. So did like Taiwan semi you know miraculously get six billion of excess capacity? Did they pay off Taiwan to screw their smaller clients? Uh what exactly happened? Uh and this is starting to make a little bit more sense to what happened, how they could go uh from well they were doing 4 billion uh a quarter revenue growth capped by Taiwan Semiconductor, but last quarter it went down to two and that's when the market didn't like it. So they were really up against the wall to have a good quarter. Um but miraculously the accounts receivable jumped up. So, um, to understand why this matters, we must examine day sales outstanding, a metric measuring how long it takes for a company to collect payment after making a sale for Nvidia's third quarter of fiscal year 2026, covering the period ending October 27th, 2025. The calculation is straightforward. Uh, daily day sales outstanding equals accounts receivable divided by revenue times days in the period. So, that would been 33.4 billion divided by 57.01* 01 * 91 days equals 53.3 days. Nvidia's historical DSO uh from 2020 2024 stood at 46. So that's a 15%.9% degradation in collection efficiency. By itself seems unremarkable. Extended payment terms are common in enterprise technology sales. Um, as of their most recent quarterly reports though, AMD shows a 42-day DSO, Intel 38 days, Taiwan Semiconductor 35, and Micron shows 44. Nvidia is the outlier, and in forensic accounting, outliers demand explanation. The math reveals the magnitude. Nvidia's daily revenue equals 624,57.01 by 91. A 7-day collection delay represents 4.3 billion per quarter. That's a pretty magical number, ladies and gentlemen. Extract extrapolated across three quarters since Blackwell Architecture launched in Q1 fiscal 20 26 and the cumulative gap reaches 13.2 billion. Bloomberg terminals flagged this within 45 minutes of the filing. Quantitative hedge funds activated short positions within 2 hours. By market opening November 20th, institutional order flow had reversed from buying to net selling. The algorithms had detected something human analyst would take days recognize. Nvidia's customers aren't paying for chips they've already received. The inventory par paradox second anomaly appeared simultaneously in the same financial statement. Nvidia reported inventory of 19.8 billion up from 15 billion the prior quarter. This represents a 32% quarter-over-arter growth. During the earnings call, Jensen Wong described demand as quote insane unquote and characterized supply constraints as the primary limitation for revenue growth. CFO Colette Crest cited lead times exceeding 10 weeks for certain GPU configurations. The inventory paradox is this. The companies experiencing genuine demand constraints with extended lead times reduce inventory as they convert stock piles into sales. They don't build inventory by 32% in a single quarter. Historical precedent supports this principle. When Nvidia launched Hopper 1 H100 architecture in Q2 2023, also amid reported supply constraints and strong demand, inventory declined 18% quarter-over-arter as the company fulfilled backlogged order. The current inventory trajectory suggests one of two scenarios. Either demand is weaker than management claims and chips are accumulating unsold or customers are accepting delivery without payment capability causing inventory to convert to receivables rather than to cash. Channel checks conducted by by this author support the latter hypothesis. Arrow Electronics, a major semiconductor distributor, reported in its Q3 2025 earnings that Nvidia product inventory days stood at 78 compared to a 52day average for other product lines. This represents a 50% higher inventory holding periods, indicating distribution channel satur saturation. GPU spot pricing on third-party compute marketplaces provides additional evidence. VAS.ai AI and runpod.io platforms where users rent GPU compute capacity by the hour show H100 spot prices declining from 3 $3.20 per hour in August 2025 to $212 per hour as of November 20th, 2025. This 34% price decline directly contradicts the claims of insatiable demand. Cash flow signal operating cash flow provides the 30. By the way, uh let me give you the name of this author on Substack. Shanaka Anslam Pereira. Every now and then these bearish folks have something good to say. Operating cash flow provides the third party verification point. Nvidia generated 4.5 billion in cash flow operations during Q3 fiscal 2026 while reporting net income of 19.3 billion resulting in a 75.1% cash conversion ratio falls well below semiconductor industry standards. Taiwan semiconductor the world's largest chip manufacturing consistently maintains operating cash flow at 100% to 105% of net net income. AMD is at 97%. Even Intel currently executing a costly turnaround strategy maintains 91%. A 75% conversion ratio indicates working capital consumption. The specific components appear in the cash flow statement increasing in accounts receivable and inventory absorbed of 11.2 billion in cash during the quarter. Meanwhile, Nvidia deployed 9.5 billion on share repurchases. The capital allocation decision meets scrutiny. The company The company prioritizing stock buybacks over cash collection signals confidence in reported earnings, but reveals actual cash generation insufficient to support both shareholder returns and operational growth. Veteran short seller Michael Barry, known for predicting 2008 subprime crisis, has publicly disclosed put option positions and Nvidia uh with a strike price of $148 and March 2026 expiration. The position implies conviction that Nvidia stock will fall by at least 25% within four months, precisely the time frame when aging receivables would force reserve increases and potential restatements. It's funny, I watched a big short on the plane home from London and um I remember his whole thesis being predicated on the option arms coming due in the first quarter of 2027 when all hell broke loose. and while his investors were giving him hell uh uh on the way up and he says just wait till Q1 when all of that stuff um resets and sure enough he was right. Circular financing structure we've heard enough about that. Um well on October 8th 2025 XAI announced a $20 billion funding round structured as a special purpose vehicle. The capital structure consisted of 7.5 billion in equity, 12.5 billion in debt. Nvidia contributed to up to two billion of the equity tranch. The debt covenant requires XAI to maintain GPU utilization above 70% or face default. XAI uses the capital to lease GPUs from Nvidia. Nvidia books this on as revenue, but Nvidia also holds equity in XAI creating a circular flow. Nvidia provides capital to XAI which uses that capital to buy Nvidia products which Nvidia records as revenue which support Nvidia's valuation which enables the the equity stake in XAI to appear valuable on Nvidia's balance sheet. The structure extends throughout the AI ecosystem. Microsoft invested 13 billion in OpenAI. OpenAI committed 50 billion to Microsoft Azure cloud service over 5 years. Microsoft uses those committed dollars to purchase NVIDIA GPUs for Azure data centers. Data Nvidia books the GPU sales as revenue. Oracle announced $300 billion 5-year cloud infrastructure partnership with OpenAI. This partnership requires Oracle to deploy NVIDIA GPUs. Oracle has pre-ordered 8 billion in Blackwell architecture chips from Nvidia. OpenAI's ability to fill 300 billion Oracle commitment depends on OpenAI generating revenue that currently runs at 3.7 billion annually, a gap of 56.3 billion per year. The total network spans 610 billion in circular commitments according to an analyst of SEC filings. Venture capital deal databases and disclosed partnerships. The money flows in loops. Nvidia invests in AI startups. Startups commit to cloud spending. Cloud providers purchase Nvidia hardware. Nvidia recognizes revenue, but the cash never completes the circuit because the underlying economic activity AI applications generating profit remains insufficient. Vibe revenue. Brian Chesy, CEO of Airbnb stated, "There's a lot of vibe revenue and AI companies are talking about billions in the pipeline that may never materialize." Blah blah blah. Sam Alman, we're in uncharted territory. No one knows if this scales to AGI or hits a wall at GPT5. These admissions carry weight because they contradict a growth narrative supporting current valuation. Open AAI valued at 157 billion in most recent round 3.7 billion in revenue simultaneously disclosed operating expenses of 13 billion resulting in a 9.3 billion annual cash burn historical precedent. So he talks about Lucent, Worldcom, Enron. This is interesting. Lucent, once America's largest telecom communications equipment manufacturing, grew revenue through vendor financing agreements. The company lent money to telecom carriers to purchase Lucent Equipment, booking the equipment sales as revenue, while the loans appeared as receivables. When carriers couldn't repay, Lucent took 8.7 billion in write-offs. Lucence's DSO peaked at 64 days before the fraud became public. Nvidia's current 53-day DSO remains below that threshold, but exceeds its historical baseline by the same percentage that preceded Lucen's collapse. Enron used special purpose vehicles to hide uh debt and inflate revenue. These entities existed as legally separate companies but were economically controlled by Enron. structure created artificial revenue through transactions with entities Enron itself funded. The XAI SPV structure mirrors this approach. Nvidia provides equity capital to an entity that exists primarily to purchase Nvidia products. Transaction appears at arms length in Nvidia's accountant, but economically Nvidia is funding its own revenue. Margin compression evidence. Nvidia's gross margin for Q3 2026 came in at 73.4% on a gap basis. The prior quarter showed 74.6 represents 120 basis points decline. uh 57 H 400% selling price in industry analysts initially dismissed this as product uh shift mix lower margin data center sales growing faster than higher margin and professional util visualization segments but product mix analysis doesn't support this explanation. The Blackwell GB200 architecture carries an average selling price of approximately $70,000 per unit compared to 30,000 for the prior generation H100. The new architecture should improve, not reduce gross margins. Advanced packaging costs using TSMC's co-ass chip on wafer on substrate technology add roughly $400 per chip, representing less than 1% of the selling price. A 120 basis point margin decline on 57 billion revenue equals 684 million annualized. represents 2.7 billion in margin deterioration that product mix cannot explain. Forensic analysis suggests three possible explanation. First, channel incentives to move inventory effectively discounting to distributors and cloud providers. Second, warranty reserves for potential blackwell thermal issues that multiple sources have reported. Third, bad debt reserves for aging receivables that management has not yet disclosed at appropriate levels. Michael Bur's public thesis focuses on the depreciation policy. Nvidia depreciates property, plant, and equipment at approximately 6.6% annually based on disclosed asset values of 63.8 billion and depreciated expense of 4.2 billion. Industry standards for semiconductor equipment run between 12% and 15% annually, reflecting the rapid obsolescence of chip manufacturing and testing equipment. If Nvidia normalized depreciation to 12%, annual depreciation expense would increase by approximately 3.4 4 billion, reducing net income by 18%. This accounting choice may partially explain why Nvidia's earnings exceed its cash generation by such a wide margin. Smart money exit. Okay. Peter Theal's uh sold 100 million at at $182. Uh the believes internal memo obtained by Wall Street Journal indicated Theo believes quote AI monetization remains 3 to 5 years away and current valuations price uncertainty that doesn't really exist. SoftBank disposed of 5.8 billion in Nvidia holdings at an average price of 178. Attributed the sale to rebalancing in preparation for the ARM holdings IPO offering lock up. However, timing 8 days before earnings suggests access to information indicating upcoming results would disappoint. Bur scion uh management filed uh the put options. We all know about that. uh centralized. So there's more and more here. You can read the Securities and Exchange Commission has not yet announced a formal investigation into Nvidia's accounting practices. However, several indicators suggest regulatory scrutiny has begun. On November 18, 2025, two days before Nvidia's earnings release, the SEC's Division of Corporate Finance sent comment letters to three cloud infrastructure companies requesting additional disclosure on revenue recognition policies for cloud credit arrangements. While the SEC hasn't confirmed the connection, the timing and specificity of the requests align with concerns about circular financing. The PCAOB, which oversees audit firms, has initiated a review of revenue recognition practices in the technology sector, according to sources familiar with the matter. Price Waterhouse Cooper serves as Nvidia's auditor. Historically regulatory timeliness provide guidance on likely progression. SEC typically requires 12 to 18 months from the initial inquiry to formal wells notice indicating intent to file charges. If the November 18th comment letters represent the beginning of the SEC scrutiny, formal charges would likely emerge between November 2026 and May 2027. Broader AI industry faces a $3.1 trillion question. Can artificial intelligence applications generate sufficient economic value to justify current infrastructure investment? The answer will determine whether the current correction represents temporary volatility or the beginning of a fundamental revaluation. Uh what the machines detected in 18 hours on November 2025, human markets will spend the next 18 months processing. The algorithm that identified fraud has set in motion a reckoning that will reshape technology investing for the next decade. Uh author has no positions in any position security. So Shanaka an Selm slam Pereira uh wrote this article really interesting. I think he's probably extreme on a couple of these points but uh where there's smoke there can be fire. Um you know we have no positions on Nvidia or Palunteer. We do have those uh put spreads that we put in to uh uh in the beginning of October expecting a 6 to 9% pullback. So, we're getting close. We took off some of those today. Um but we'll keep some more for uh additional protection. Remember that was a 1% position with expected value, high expected value to dampen volatility in a bumpy market which is now coming in handy. Here's from Michael Bur. Understanding depreciation by extending useful life of assets artificially boosts earnings. One of the more common frauds of the modern era. Massively ramping capex through purchase of Nvidia chips servers on a 2 to threeyear product cycle should not result in the extension of the useful lives of compute equipment. Yet this is exactly what all hyperscalers have done. By my estimates they will understate depreciation by 1676 billion in 2026 to 2028. By 28, Oracle will overstate earnings by 26.9%, Meta by 20.8%, but it gets worse. More detail coming November 25th. Stay tuned. Uh, so that's that. Here's more from Michael Bur. Since the beginning of 2018, Nvidia earned about 205 billion of net income and 188 billion of free cash flow, assuming all capex growth was capex as stockbased compensation amounted to 20.5 billion, but it bought back 112.5 billion worth of stock and there were 47 million more shares outstanding. The true cost of stockbased compensation dilution was 112 billion reducing owners earnings by 50%. They're absolutely pigs. And you can see it, which we went over it two weeks ago. If you're wondering who was selling alongside um Peter Theal and selling alongside SoftBank while the company was buying shares, the number one seller was Jensen Wong himself who sold an average of 13 billion 13 million a day as far as the eye can see. So, let's just take a look while the company is buying. Here we go. All the way up into the dark period. 5 million. 5 million. 14 million. This is all Well, let's just do Jensen. Forget forget all the other insiders. October 29th, 5 million, 5 million, 13 million. This is This is daily, guys. Four 4.7 4.8 4.8 4.7 13.9 13.6 6 13.4 13 This is every day, ladies and gentlemen. October 23rd 13.6 13.4 13.6 13.6. This goes all the way back. Every single day 134 million every single day. 134 million. Just going all the way back all the way back to the to to June of 2025. And then he did the exact same thing before that. But big time selling like nonstop as much as he's able to sell through his plan every single day. 12 to 13 million for literally every, you know, 150 consecutive trading days um while he's out on the road, you know, pitching all this stuff. Um so anyway, it is what it is. Maybe the stock bottoms tomorrow, but uh I just thought that was a lot. Uh here's more from Michael Bur. Every company listed below as a specialist revenue recognition. The actual chart with all will give and take deals will be unreadable. The future will regard this as a picture of fraud, not a flywheel. True end demand is ridiculously small. Almost all customers are funded by their dealers. If you came can name open AAI's auditor in one hour, you win some pride. Okay. All right. So, enough on that. Let's get down to uh other stuff. Nearly 600 brands surpass 100 million yuan in sales. Over 30,000 achieved double digit growth. T- mall records best uh 1111 growth in 4 years. So that's some news on Baba. Um S&P returns into year end following greater than 15% trough through October. So, it points to some year-end possible strength. We'll see. Here's the PE of the health care sector versus the S&P 500. You can see here trough, lowest since 2000. That's why we had to get one more position on in the healthc care sector. Defensive, same story. Best value since 25 years from now. We've got enough defenses between um the stocks we've discussed. Uh household leverage is good. That's positive. Uh then we've got share of companies mentioning layoffs has ticked up. So the key is going to be whether the Fed cuts in December. The odds of a cut went up about 10% today. So hopefully that's followed through. There was a lady cook out talking about bubbles and all this stuff and concerns. Uh so we'll see fewer inflation concerns. market breath has been poor poorest since the 2022 lows. Uh here are when you have this kind of poor breath what happens looking 12 months out on average you're up 10% which is lower than without declines in breath. Uh one month later you're up zero. 3 months later you're up one, six months later you're up one. So it could be some some consolidation in the indices which means tech down the rest holding their holding the holding uh water. Uh here are the food companies basic necessities worst three years on record worst since uh 2000 right before the tech wreck and then they just took off like nobody's business. So if you don't have any defensive exposure, you want to get some uh high quality stocks underperformance is at 1990 ex 999 extremes. So these are the divergences we look for where huge money can be made. Um, we're not bearish, but we are um we're looking to what will perform if the indices take a breather, which is aka the AI trade takes a breather, what's going to do great, and that's how we're positioned. So, uh, that I think with some of the things that we just talked about and some of the conditions of these, I think sets up for really exciting things for us in 2026, irrespective of what the indices do in a midterm election year, which tends to be spotty. Confidence in the economy is running high. Lithium extends winning streak. S&P 500 is at record highs while private equity breaks down. Total return basket of Blackstone, KKR and Carlile is rolling over. Oracle last 12 months free cash flow absolutely uh collapsed. Okay, this is uh kind of a signal indicator. The CDS cost to ensure their debt has gone straight up. Uh these are not things you want to see uh if you're in the AI trade. energy sector market cap weight in the S&P 500 down to 2020 lows. Those of you who were with us in the beginning of the podcast five years ago know we were monster buyers of Exxon at 33 bucks the last time it got this low made a ton of money on that and I think now the better play than the EMP or the integrated is uh the national oil well Varco because you're less sensitive to the price of oil. I mean, what what's interesting about it, I was talking with a friend today is um I look at the setup and I want to buy every exploration and production company I could get my hands on. And then when I look at the individual names, I don't think they've come up down enough relative to the price of oil. It's not an obvious no-brainer like it was in 2020. So therefore, it's like how do I play what I think is going to be a resurgence in the sector without overpaying for the opportunity? And that came in servicesers. Uh and the best balance sheet with the most uh exposure was a national oil wellvarco. And then the uh natural gas play being compoc resources uh which will fuel the whole to whatever extent AI turns out to be the big deal which it will uh but but in a tempered way. And the question is how much are they paying for that? Look the whole buildout of all the global crossing and all the wire that that was true. We needed all that for the uh for the internet, but what they were paying for that in 2009 and etc. Uh and the amount of excess uh stuff that they laid proved to be an error. Okay. Sales growth and margin expansion powering S&P 500 returns in 2025 much more so than multiple expansion. So there is some underlying health. Natural gas moving up on cold weather. Credit card spend rose following a fall in September. So that's positive. Market cap of the largest stock relative to the 75th percentile stock way to top 10 stocks in the S&P 500 is now well over uh 2000 before the techre, well over 1973, well over 1964, and well over um the early 30s. So you just have to watch it if you're in the crowded trades is my view. We're in none of the crowded trades. Uh but we are beneficiaries of AI through reasonably valued plays with Intel, you know, outperforming um Nvidia by 2 to1 this year and with um uh Alibaba outperforming all the other AI players this year as well. So, we played the theme with margin of safety, and the ones that have that have played it with no margin of safety are getting a little bit monkey hammered lately. Uh, and um, and that's the way it goes. Nothing new under the sun, ladies and gentlemen. Uh, here's US big tech CDS brid spreads hit two-year highs. So this this is the highest level since the October 2022 lows when we were huge buyers of Google and Amazon and those were quick doubles in a year and a half or so. Um we're not there yet, but if we get a you know if we get a huge selloff in tech in 2026, uh we may be aggressive buyers of tech once again. Maybe we will be buying the AI trade just at lot lower levels. We will see. Uh number of completed unsold new homes. So, this is a function of mortgage rates. We're going to talk about a couple proposals on the table in Washington to help with that. The portability of mortgages and uh assumability. We'll see how that goes. Okay. A little bit underweight. So, people are getting knocked out here. You're seeing uh the Prime Book now down to 2022 levels. That's uh hotels, restaurants, and leisure. That's why we put on finally got a restaurant trade on. It's a restaurant. I'll give you a hint. You don't you don't sit in this restaurant, but there's food comes to your house. So, we'll put it that way. You might walk into the restaurant to get your food. It's restaurant themed. And we pounded our head. We look, we almost bought Dine Brands, which is uh Applebee's. They're doing these stores Applebee's and IHOP uh combos so you can eat 24 hours a day if you want pancakes at 7 at night. If you want uh uh I don't know, cheesy pull strings, whatever the hell out. Applebee uh Oreo shake. What's that country song? Anyway, uh if you want your Oreo shake at 6:00 in the morning, you can now get it cuz it's two in one. It's working. The problem with the reason we didn't pull the trigger on Dine Brands as opposed to the one we did pull the trigger on is because this CEO that's in is a real estate guy and the stock has collapsed underneath him. He got in in 2001 and you know it's like asking asking the arsonist to put out the fire is not always the best move. Um maybe he'll catch a break with this uh new initiative. But what I didn't want to do is put myself in a position where they f the board finally dumps them because the stock is down so much. Then I got to wait two quarters for the new CEO to find the coffee maker, do his kitchen sink quarter, stock goes down another 15% before it doubles or triples. So that's why we passed on dine. I think it's possible he's going to get lucky and it turns around under his leadership, but I think you need a restaurant operator in there. I think the real estate plays that he was brought in to do have already been done at at the expense of the operating culture and and he just doesn't know it. I mean, you know, so uh so that's that AI data center funding sources. Let's see. No less than 5.3 trillion will be spent on global data source and AI infrastructure and related power supplies over the next five years. That'll help Generrack glooier outlook is not holding back retail stock buying. A AI investor asset allocation. More US markets cutting rents today than at the height of COVID. That's interesting to see. I think multif family is in for a stretch of uh I think there's some over capacity. Multif family. Maybe multif family becomes the next office. As office recovers, multif family starts to weaken a little bit. Uh it depends where in the country are. I I've got some clients that are just rock stars with multif family and they pick the right areas and they they do well through every cycle. Um months not years performance gap between China and the US generative AI is narrow narrowing aka BABA short interest in small caps as it's moving to new highs is at record high. This is going to get unwound. I think that could be a good year for small caps next year. Certainly relative to large caps follow through on that trend that started in July with small caps outperforming large caps. City Economic Surprise Index versus S&P 500 cyclical sectors total return. So the cyclical sector's return has been terrible, but the economic surprise index has been good. Usually when the economic surprise index is good, the uh sector catches back up. So, I think that's the point that Jim Pollson is trying to make here and his points are worth following. He is a rock star. Jim Pollson's a legend. Uh, Trouble in Paradise. This is the CDS on the uh Oracle got up 60 basis points in a matter of weeks. That's uh that's pretty intense. US small cap at multi-deades low versus large cap last time was 86 and then 2001 and you had monster moves after both and you got to go back to 1956. So this is setting up for a historic run. Biggest inflow into healthcare since January 2021. We've been pounding the table on this uh all year and positioning and now it's starting to happen early stages which is why we wanted to get that last piece on and uh we're very pleased that we did. We'll be finishing out on some of the excess money, getting getting more and more exposure. But for existing clients, if you didn't have space and you don't have it and you want it, email me. We'll get you the names. You can do what you want uh on your own. Um or add money to your account. Um S&P 500 cycle composite for 2025. Yeah, that that's that. But none of that has worked this year. Uh, mortgage applications are up as rates are going down. That'll start to leak through to housing for next year. Um, what else we got here? We got a lot of stuff. Historic outperformance of healthcare over the past three days. It's crushing it. Defense defensives are starting to outperform offensive stocks. Improving earnings momentum. That's that bodess pretty well. Biotech breaking out. This took a little while. Uh, I remember um I remember buying a bunch down here and then it shot up. I thought I was a genius and then two years later it rechecked and it's just been grinding sideways and now it's breaking out and taking off. So, we're excited about that. Healthcare relative to the S&P 500. This is generational opportunity. This is why we got a third position going in this. We haven't seen this in 25 years. So, we want we want that exposure. You're going to see it next year. It's going to be monstrous. Uh, global funds have been reducing their underweight exposure to emerging markets. This is an early trend. Biggest weight in emerging markets is China. Everyone's behind the eightball. They're going to chase into that. Uh, San Francisco Fed study examines 150 years of US tariffs and find that they lead to lower inflation and weaker aggregate demand, which is lower rates, which helps housing. Foreign investors are putting more money into Chinese equities. You can see this trough in 2023 starting to take off again in 2025. Will be even more next year as people chase 2026. Cyclical growth is expected to pick up discretionary investor equity. I don't take me positioning. So underweight, discretionary, we like those opportunities in the spaces we've discussed, two of which we covered today, the FC Corp and Goose, which we'll get to the article of the week. Percent of US level four sectors with forward pees greater than 20. You haven't seen that since 200. And before that 1997 1998 data center power demand to quintuple over 10 years that helps our national oil well varco and comtock positions. This is amazing. Annual realized and bottom-up consensus EPS growth estimates for small caps next year is 59%. Earnings growth for S&P is 13%. NASDAQ is 17%. Midterm years tend to bottom later in the year and see larger corrections. Average correction to midterm correction is uh midterm year is 17%. I think this is going to be another one of those data things that people rely on like all the data that they were talking about this year that didn't work when everyone was on TV saying straight up after uh um in September and the exact opposite has happened. Everyone's saying end of year rally November, December. We'll see. I mean, we've definitely gotten a pullback here in November. Uh whether it's done yet is unknown, but uh should bottom in coming weeks and uh and lead to some first quarter strength. Um but midterm years tend to be weaker. The only problem I have with that this is that we had a 20% correction this year and we've had three 20% corrections over the last five years. Uh when you get it on average historically going back 70 years every 3.5 years. So, we've pulled forward 10 years of 20% corrections into five, which uh leads me to believe everyone looking for a horrible year next year might be surprised uh that things are better than expected uh and you only get a normal 10 to 14% correction, which is uh on average every year. Midterm years see the largest intraear pullback. So uh average is 17.5% and then the return after the lows is 31%. First year in office average is 12.9 we got 20. So it might be uh basswards this time. We get the 20% the first year and we get the 12% in the second year. I think that makes a lot more sense. Uh AI related revenues and capex. So here's the amount that Microsoft spending 80 billion on capex and 13 billion in AI revenues. Amazon spending 105 billion in capex, 5 billion in AI revenues. Alphabet spending 75 billion in capex, 7.7 billion in revenue. Meta is spending 72 billion in capex, 3 billion in AI revenue. overall 332 trill uh billion dollars of capex this year for only 28% um 28 billion of AI related revenue retail options. So they've they've bought longest retail weekly option buying streak on record. Uh you know now it's like 25 some odd weeks buying calls. Uh obviously they didn't get paid out in November as we said would be the case and we'll see what happens in December. There's a cluster there as well. Longest retail weekly Main Street Meter 1955 to 2025 ratio of US consumer confidence divided by labor unemployment rate. Okay. Got a lot of data for you guys this week. We should get paid overtime for this one. Uh 20% more than zero is still zero. Oh well. Uh Schiller cyclally adjusted price to earnings again getting frothy as uh concentrated by the AI trade the cape in December 1999 right before the tech wreck was 44. It's 40 right now. That's all concentrated in the AI names. And if 5% of what that author was saying about Nvidia's accounting proves to be problematic, and we probably won't know for a year, year and a half, um, that's not ideal. But if the demand continues to be phenomenal, it may not matter. They'll get away with it for years before all the chickens come home to roost five years out. And that's probably the more likely scenario. Record number of fund manager survey investors say companies are overinvesting. You can see here in the chart by the way if you listen to this podcast you get value. If you watch it uh you will get 10x the value because you can actually see and visualize and see the patterns. This whole business the edge over a couple of decades is mastering pattern recognition of different data points and seeing same stories repeat. So the more you can watch it the better. But but listening is better than nothing at all. Uh while you're at hedge fund tips, click on terms. This is all opinion, not advice as always. Um UNI University of Michigan consumer confidence. This makes me bullish when I see consumer confidence. This flushed out like in May of 1980, October of 1990 recession, November of 2008, you had two more months of weakness there. August of 2011, you had two more months of weakness there. uh but they were at or near bottoms before you got huge uh recovery rallies in the stock market. People are getting the message four-week flows for tech stocks at all-time lows. So people are getting out. So that's what's creating a liquidity issue. Now on the flip side, you have to keep in mind they're stopping quantitative tightening in December. So you're going to get and you got 313 cuts globally, central bank cuts. So there's there you're gonna start to see a liquidity flood come in sometime in December. So if you get further weakness, you got to be careful not to get too bearish. Again, it's just going to come down to buying those stocks that are so cheap relative to intrinsic value when you look two to three years out that even if you buy it and it goes down another 5%, you could care less because it's going to double or triple over a few years. And that's that's the way you got to play it. If you think you're going to time the exact bottom or any of that stuff, you're gonna make a huge mistake. You got to get good quality B. You know, Buffett in his later years was known for buying great businesses at good prices. Uh his best performance a and most of his outperformance in terms of the waitings was when he was running separately managed accounts like I do and he was buying good businesses at great prices. And that's what we do here, which is implies turnaround stories. Um, uh, and um, so something to keep in mind. His his philosophy changed when his structure changed. When you have unlimited amounts of free insurance float coming in that you have to invest, the only way you get exposure is through large caps, which by definition are great businesses and hopefully you're buying them at good prices on pullbacks versus uh what what put him on the map uh and made his first, you know, 20 30 million that he rolled into Birkshire was um good businesses at great prices and that's what we do here as of October 202. 25 53% of homes have lost value over the past year as measured by their estimate. I told you affordability was coming to a theater near you. It's early stages. My wife thinks we got the most amazing deal on a house we just bought. I told her, "Congratulations, we did. A year from now, it'll be worth less than what we paid for it, but a house is not an investment." and you know water polo yada yada yada happy wife all that stuff. So um easy financial conditions point to a reaceleration in the economy. This is Alibaba. Net purchases in the last handful of weeks have been going straight up. So we'd like to see that pent up buyers. Uh retail net buys are almost the lowest year to date. uh which kind of starts to imply that uh we might be towards we're closer to the end than the beginning of this pullback that that that I will say uh generally have that view but it's funny I go through different pockets of the market pockets of the market I mean they were asking me this morning when Nvidia was up 5% you know are you buyer no price is what you pay value is what you get I mean uh Palunteer same anyway it's the same story over and over. Now it's playing out. Probability of a 25 basis point cut in December. That's just this has just jumped up from what was 20% a few few days ago to now 40%. Man, there's a lot of data this week. I guess that next week they're all putting it out this week because next week is Thanksgiving. It's going to be more sparse. biggest pileup of shorts on record. Spending on holiday items is significantly ahead of 2023 and 2024 levels. That's good to see. That points to uh discretionary items. Hopefully, they're buying a lot of vans in Timberland and North Face. That would be incredible. Uh Atlanta, Atlanta Fed GDP now for Q3 is up over 4%. So even if the shutdown hits by 1%, we're still in good shape there. Economic activity running along trend defenses relative to tech spread. The last time you saw this type of what we call an open fishmouth was uh 2000, right before tech rolled over. I think we're early. I think the spread's going to get a little bit wider, but um just note the divergence. You don't you don't really want to be a buyer here, even if the spread continues a little longer before it reverses. Nvidia's inventory is exploding. We talked about that. Okay, articles. Let's uh Alibaba prep's big revamp of flagship app AI app to rival chat GPT. It's going to resemble OpenAI's chat GPT and plans to rename it Quen. Company will add aentic AI features to support shopping on platforms including the main Tao marketplace and aims to make Quen a fully functional AI agent. The revamped Quen app will remain free until you for users for now, but building a user base will help Alibaba charge for consumerf facing services in the future. Love it.

We'll just pay the money out. We're not returning the money and then we'll get a work around you with other rules to reinstate the tariffs. The deals are already done. They're not going to flip them back. Rotation from tech leads investors to dividend paying stocks. Amen. Hallelujah. Uh we've got a number of them in the portfolio. We've discussed earnings. M&A potential have small cap investors turning bullish. We agree. Worried about AI stocks? Look abroad for dividends and value. Amen. Uh, trillion dollar AI valuations, yes. Productivity boom, not yet. Nvidia says there's quote, "No assurance of a final agreement with Open AI despite a hundred billion dollar pact."

Buffett Berkshire Hathaway, I'm going quiet. And article of the week, don't let the gloom fool you. Stock market and sentiment results. Uh so here are the key points from the Bank of America fund manager survey. For the first time, the survey began in 2025. The majority of fund manager surveys with a net 20% now say companies are over investing in the AI capex boom. Until now, the market has been willing to give hyperscalers time to show the R in return on invested capital. But with hyperscaler free cash flow set to drop by 43% through Q1 2026 and 60% of their operating cash flow going to capex levels on par with big oil, investors are starting to say, "Show me the money." Number two, opinion follows trend. Now that emerging markets are outperforming the US by more than 2 to1, 37% of FMS investors now expect emerging markets to outperform in 2026 compared to just 6% who expect the S&P to outperform. Three fund managers cut their allocation to consumer discretionary stocks by the most on record, taking exposure down by 16 percentage points and to the lowest level since December 2022. Betting against the US consumer when they have jobs rarely works out and we're happy to take the other side of that trade. We you we've covered uh we're going to cover two discretionary names and we added a restaurant um brand. It's not a restaurant you eat in. I'm not going to say more about that now until everyone's fully positioned. Fund managers expectations for global growth turn positive in to a net 3% for the first time this year as economic expectations continue to catch up to stock prices. With sentiment still essentially neutral, there's plenty of room for expectations to move higher. Fund managers average cash level dropped to only 3.7% the lowest in 15 years. There have been 20 instances of cash levels 3.7% or lower since 2002. And in every case stocks delivered negative returns while treasuries outperformed over the following 1 to 3 months. That implies yields are going to compress which will help rates and defensives. Um so keep that in mind. Consumer gloom not so fast. Back in September, right after the Fed finally acknowledged a dual mandate and delivered the first rate cut, investors began tripping over themselves to pile into the obvious trades, discretionary small caps, and rate sensitives, all catching a bid after being left for dead. The market quickly convinced itself that this was now an all or nothing regime as the pendulum swung risk on leaving the boring defensive corners of the market completely forgotten. We pushed back on that idea in our view, our view then and now is that the current environment is one where both trades can work. When the rubber band gets stretched to one extreme and everyone crowds into one side of the boat, reversion to the mean becomes inevitable. Or as we like to say in plain English, the market tends to inflict the most pain on the most people at any point in time. With that in mind, we went hunting in the ignored defensive areas of the market, whether it was healthcare, staples, or energy, topping off existing positions and picking up new names from the clearance rack. Fast forward to today and the pendulum has swung all the way back as tech has started to wobble and airs leaked out of the shiny objects on the AI trade. Exactly the type of rotation you would expect has started to happen. The unloved dividend payers and defensive corners of the market that we've been pounding the table on are starting to catch a bid. Biggest inflow to healthcare since January 2021. Rotation from tech leads investors to dividend paying stocks. But just like September, the market has overreacted once again. Investors have crowded into one side and thrown out the baby with bath water. This time it just so happens to be consumer discretionary. Uh monthly allocation cut by the most since 2005, 16 percentage point. It's now the lowest since December 2022. Net 23% underweight. Fund managers have cut exposure to discretionary by the most on record. The new consensus is simple. The consumer is dead. We think that's a mistake with some of these names priced at panic levels as if consumers will never spend again. In fact, sentiment around the consumer is as washed out as we've seen it in decades at levels unheard of outside of major recessions. Yet, nearly every data point in earnings call tell you the same story. The consumer may complain, but they keep spending. Or, as Brack and Daryl likes to call them, the stubbornly positive consumer. Consu consumers may say the world is ending, but the next day they go out and buy a car, shop for the holidays, or take the family to Disney. Pay attention to what they do, not what they say. If there's one thing we have learned time and time again, never bid against the US consumer when they have jobs. The reports of my death are greatly exaggerated by Mark Twain. All here is the k and here is the kicker. Deflation disc discretionary is being left for dead exactly as we enter a Fed easing cycle. What has historically outperformed in the 12 months following the start of Fed cuts exactly what investors have abandoned. Discretionary has been the top performing sector performing 75% of the time uh outperforming 75% of the time and by 300 basis points annually across past easing cycles. Unbelievable. The whipped cream uh and the cherry would be if the proposed $2,000 tariff dividend checks make it to the finish line. If that happens, investors will be tripping over themselves to get exposure back into the sector, at which point we will be happy to help them out. Whether that happens or not is anyone's guess. But until then, we are more than happy to stand pat and take the doomsday crowd up on their offer of a second bite at the Apple opportunity in some of our favorite names. VF Corp update. VF delivered another solid quarter as the turnaround continues to take shape. Revenues of 2.8 8 billion up 2% year-onear or down 1% or down 1% came in Canadian dollar came in ahead of expectations and prior guidance nearly oh constant dollar constant currency near nearly 70% of the portfolio is now back to topline growth compared to just 10% at this point last year adjusting operating margins the single adjusted operating margins the single most important metric in the turnaround expanded by 40 basis points year on year to 11.8%. Net debt is down 1.5 billion or 21% year-onear. Inventories are cleaner. Free cash flow is still on track to grow this year. But none of that progress mattered to the short-term voting machine. Instead of focusing on the clearly improving fundamentals, the stock sold off on the quarter uh on quartertoarter macro noise around tariffs and the final stages of cleanup actions that weighed on a conservatively guided Q3. Investors wanted an overnight return to growth and when they didn't get it, they lost patience and threw in the towel. For us, this is silly season and a reminder of the advantage that comes from zooming out. Good operations don't chase good operators don't chase short-term revenue to beat the next quarter. They build a foundation that creates durable earnings power for years to come. That is exactly what Bracken Daryl is doing. And if anyone had doubts, he spelled it out plainly on the call. Quote, "We're really trying to think in terms of driving growth longer term, not just what we can do this holiday." and in Q4. It's our that's our mindset for the entire business. I hope you're starting to get a feel for that. We're going to execute in the key commercial moments, but our real game plan is longer term than that. We're going to systematically put the building blocks in place that are going to deliver for years to come. When you step back and burden yourself with the facts, the story becomes obvious. Cleanup actions are nearly lapped. The product pipeline is ramping. Brand heat is building. Most importantly, the medium-term targets of 55% gross margins and 10% operating margins remain firmly on track. And here is what the market continues to overlook. Those targets assume zero topline growth through fiscal year 2028. Let me repeat, the path to 10% operating margins is driven entirely by cost savings, not revenue growth. That is about as low a bar as you will find for a business already showing signs of inflection. When Voffcorf does return to growth, operating leverage kicks in and each dollar $1 billion of incremental revenue lifts operating margins by 1.5 to2%. It doesn't take a genius to look at the chart below and see how close that inflection actually is. The market continues to ignore this with consensus still modeling a little over 8% operating margins for fiscal year 2028. And if there's one thing we've learned is that you do not want to bet against Brack and Daryl. Until then, we sit on our hands, stay patient, and let Turnaround Bracken, or growth bracken as he prefers, do what he does best. Here's the earnings call uh breakdown in the deck. We highlighted the most important parts um and the 10 key points. Number one, Q2 revenues were 2.8 8 billion up 2% year-on-year or down 1% in constant currency, beating estimates by 70 million and coming in ahead of management's guidance for a 4% to 2% decline in constant currency. The upside was driven by better than expected back- to-school performance and early wholesale demand. Adjusted EPS of 52 cents beat consensus by 10 cents. Two, Timberland delivered its fourth consecutive quarter of global growth across both across both DTC and wholesale, posting 7% growth or 4% constant currency driven by continued strength in the Americas. The re region grew 11% year-on-year supported by a strong back to school season and remains a major opportunity for the brand. Management noted that Timberland is still terribly un under distributed in the US with only six fullric stores. The plan is to expand DTC deliberately beginning in Q3 and continuing into Q4 rather than aggressively expanding into the wholesale channel. Three, Northace delivered topline growth across all regions and across both DTC and wholesale with revenue up 6% or 4% constant currency. Footwear grew by double digits in every region region as management executes on the long-term plan to triple the footwear business and double apparel and equipment all while working to make the North Face a true four-season brand. Four vans revenues improved sequentially but still declined 9% or 11% constant currency with more than 20% of the drop tied to intentional channel rationalization efforts that are expected to be fully lapped in Q4. Management noted the early influence of Vans president Sun Cho in the product pipeline which first appeared during back to school and will ramp through the holiday season and into next year. Product newness is driving higher sell through with women's old school styles up more than 20% an important focus for Vans as women's revenue sits near an 8-year low. The pearlized old school shoe Bracken highlighted on the call is another early hit launching online and in stores in the past week and already selling out in both colors and sizes. Management also expects the multi-year partnership with SZA to be a key catalyst and a major influence on upcoming products and the upgraded marketing push in seasons ahead. Five Ultra continues to fire on all cylinders, delivering more than 35% growth and making its third consecutive quarter of double-digit gains. The brand is now on track to exceed 250 million in revenue this year compared to about 50 million at this time at the time of acquisition in early 2018 and is still operating with less than 10% brand awareness in the US and even lower levels internationally early early days. Six, the Dicki sale, which closed last week is expected to generate more than 600 million in overall cash benefit through reduced capex and lower net interest expenses. From a price standpoint, the deal was highly attractive with management's fiscal year 2026 estimates implying an enterprise value to sales multiple of 1.2 times and an EV to Ebida multiple north of 20 times for a brand that had posted three straight years of double-digit revenue declines and was margin dilutive. This sale was a no-brainer. Management plans to use all of the proceeds to pay down debt, which will accelerate the path toward the medium-term target of net leverage below 2.5 times. Seven adjusted operating income of 330 million came in well above management's prior guidance of 260 to 290 million. Adjusted operating margins the key metric in the VF turnaround reached 11.8% up 40 basis points yearonear. Most importantly management reiterated confidence in reaching the medium-term targets of 55% gross margins and 10% adjusted operating margins by fiscal year 2028 compared to 53.5 and 5.9% last fiscal year. Eight. Management continues to make progress cleaning up the balance sheet with net debt down uh 1.5 billion, a 21% reduction, and down 27% year-on-year when excluding lease liabilities. Net inventories excluding Dickies were down 4% or 86 million year as management continues to improve inventory quality with further progress on inventories days expected ahead. 9 management guided to a softer than expected Q3 with revenues projected to decline by 3% uh to 1% constant currency and adjusted gross margins continued expected to be down yearon-year. The primary driver is tariff headwinds with initial pricing actions underway, but the majority not taking effect till Q4. Management continues to expect to fully offset the tariff impact within fiscal year 2027 and 10. For the full year, management still expects to deliver a yearover-year improvement in free cash flow, which was 313 million in fiscal year 2025. Current free cash flow is an outflow of 453 million, which is in line with expectations and historical seasonality since VFC Corp. typically starts generating free cash flow in Q3. This is even more impressive given that the year-over-year improvement includes the 60 million tariff expense headwind and the negative impact from the sale of Dickies, which is estimated to be 35 million. Management also expects adjusted operating income to be up year-over-year compared to 556 million last year, aka uh s ton of cash coming in in the next quarter. Hallelujah. All right, moving on. We cover we highlighted all the key points from the earnings call and now we're on to Canada Goose update. Record free cash flow, record revenues, uh low stock price. We love these all day long. So, uh, we got all this outlined to the 10 key points. Number one, Q2 direct to consumer revenues came in at 126 million, up 21.8% or 20.5% in constant currency with comps up 10.2% on strong demand in North America and mainland China. It was the third straight quarter and the 10th month in a row of positive DTC comps supported by better conversion across all regions. management noted the momentum has continued in Q3 and has a high degree of confidence in strong topline performance as we head into the holiday season. Two, wholesale revenues declined 1% or 4.8% in constant currency to 135.9 million, which was in line with management expectations as the mix continues to shift toward higher margin DTC. Wholesale still accounted for nearly half of total revenue in the quarter with Q2 typically the seasonally high point for the channel. Sell through at the top wholesale partners was higher year-over-year across every region. Three, by region, North America posted revenues of 112 million, down 7% or 8% in constant currently, mainly due to timing shift of wholesale orders into Q3. AP pack revenue rose 20% year-onear to 79.3 million driven by stronger DTC and wholesale demand with mainland China leading the way. Mainland China leading the way. EMA revenue increased 1% or declined 7% in constant currency to 81.2 two as results were affected by wholesale timing shift and tougher consumer backdrop in the UK. I went to Selfridges in UK. I didn't see any tough consumer backdrop whatsoever. Uh there was spending like there's nobody's business, but uh we'll leave that aside. Number four, management's effort to position Canada Goose as a true four-season brand continues to gain traction. Revenues from new styles more than doubled as share of total sales. And in the DTC channel, newness now represents 40% of sales versus 10% last year. Apparel remains the fastest growing category. Five, SGNA expenses rose 16% year-on-year to 187 million and increase 730 basis points as a percentage of revenue to 67.6. The higher expense base drove an adjusted operating loss of 14.2 million versus operating income of 2.5 million last year. Management noted the step up reflects a deliberate ramp in marketing and store investments that are expected to drive growth in the second half and beyond. Corporate expenses continue to grow at a much lower pace than overall revenues and management remains confident in the medium to long-term opportunity for margin expansion as operating leverage kicks in. Six, gross profit rose 3.7% to 170 million with gross margin expanding 110 basis points year-on-year to 62.4 as goose continues to benefit from higher mix of DTC sales. Seven, management announced the early renewal of the normal course issuer bid, allowing the company to repurchase up to 10% of the public float over the next 12 months. Over the past 5 years, shares outstanding have been reduced by about 12%, increasing our slice of the pie without any additional capital. Eight, management continues to clean up the inventory position with inventory down 3% year-on-year to 460 million, making the eighth straight quarter of declines. Inventory turns remained stable during the quarter at.9 times. Nine net debt fell to 77 million from 826 million a year ago, bringing net leverage down to 2.6 from 2.9, driven by stronger operating cash flow and lower credit facility borrowings. Management also refinanced a term loan during the quarter, extending its maturity to 2032 and 10. C Canada Goose completed two strategic store relocations in Paris and Beijing and opened a new permanent store in Macau which has been off to a strong start. The global network now stands at 77 permanent stores. We highlighted all the key points from the earnings call. Fear and greed down to nine which is usually where you see a bounce. I think we see a bounce tomorrow. Uh earnings exploration and production top 30 weights down 4% in the last uh 60 days. That's at EMP. Industrials uh revised down by 50 basis points in the last 60 days. Economic data unemployment rate uh on the September report went up to 4.4 from 4.3. Maybe that pushes uh the Fed in the right direction in 10 in 20 days. We shall see. Uh earnings estimates continue to go up. And now we move on to ask me anything questions from our incredible audience. Question number one comes from Zack P. Listener for three years. I tell anyone that'll listen to tune in and watch. Such great uh market context outlook for investing. Are you able to push your weight around and get an overview? Are you saying something about my weight? All right. And get an interview. I ate a little too much in Europe. That's for sure. Uh interview with Brad Jacobs, similar to what you did with the CEO of VF earlier this year. Would be a great interview. Uh look, you should email Brad and tell him to come on the podcast. I've been talking to them. They're they're they're doing great stuff. Uh and they're working uh day and night on our behalf as owners and shareholders. Um so that uh that could come to pass at over some point. We're going to have something pretty damn close coming uh in December. On December 11th, we're going to have one of our CEOs on the podcast, which will be absolutely incredible. But, uh, if you want someone on, just reach out and email them and say you need to go on and, uh, hopefully they'll get enough messages and and want to take that action, uh, when the time is right. But I think it's in their queue and I have a great relationship with those folks. As a matter of fact, his team invited me to go see him uh, at the Economic Club of New York on Tuesday um, when he's speaking to Sarah Eisen. I would have loved to do that more than anything else. The problem is I will be speaking at the money show in Sarasota and flying into New York that night. So it is what it is. Um but uh we are very very lucky to have an operator like that in our stable. Uh second to none in creating shareholder value. Uh okay. Some guy wants to be a guest on our podcast. Not going to happen. Uh Tom Farrell, thanks for putting these videos together weekly. I enjoy watching your updates. I got my dad to be a loyal watcher now. Why should we stick to 12 stocks in a portfolio is about to get to 13 to 15. No, not really. But if you get over 15, it really gets hard to outperform uh mathematically. Next, Daryl Lyset. Hey buddy. Uh hey Tom, thanks for your weekly insights. Two quick questions. are you adding to your position of PayPal at current levels? Yes, we've been adding uh very very meaningfully. And uh second, he's asking about Whirlpool. Whirlpool we cover almost every week and we continue to find it attractive looking and then when we look under the surface, we continue to have absolutely zero confidence in putting it in the portfolio. And uh part of the reason is there's absolutely no sign of a turnaround. So the top the stock is down more than 50% but so are the revenues. I mean that's a hard ass thing to turn around. Free cash flows barely staying positive. So you really need a housing miracle and a company miracle for those two miracles is uh lower probability than one and therefore we are still a pass. Good question. Alex K. Uh Tom love the podcast. Thank you for all the amazing info you share each week. Could you have a look at eat please? Uh we looked at this one too. It was not our choice in the housing sector but um uh no this definitely wasn't. No this this No. Uh this thing has I I I see the free cash flow. I see the revenue growth acceleration. I think it's all priced in at these levels. It's not for me. Matt G, what do you think of tenable revenue growing blah blah blah? T N B All right, let's look at the balance sheet. Share count's growing. Wait a second. Hold on for a second. What What are we looking at here? No, I'm looking for debt. Balance sheets. Fine. Business is generally Let's see here. Revenues are growing. Negative earnings. Let's take a look at free cash flow. Stockbased comp. This is insane. It's quadrupled. What about the share count? Share count's only up 20%. I mean, that's a lot, but revenues have doubled. What do they do? What? Let's look at cash flow. Free cash flow is growing. This looks like a software company. What are they doing here? Provides cyber exposure management solutions. Cloud delivered software as a service. Traditional modern attack service. So this is a cyber security. Yeah, I uh I think you're I think you're probably right, but we generally try to avoid some of these software companies, especially with with the AI risk. So, I I think it's very hard to have an edge, but I I think you probably do okay. I just wouldn't do it. Uh John Reio asked about Pool Corp. I mean, I think you're getting closer. Obviously, you had this peak during COVID. Everyone put in pools. Take a look at the balance sheet. got a billion dollars of debt. So, you got to see when they have to refinance that because they've only got they've got 128 of cash, 440 of receivables, free cash flow 400. Let's take a look at uh bal where's the income statement? So they peaked out in 20 2022 and they're down about uh 12% the revenues but up 20% precoid. See what's happened to the share count has been they've been buying in shares. Um I think you're getting close. I wouldn't pull the trigger on this just yet. Matt Tumbbo, TMDX. No, we don't buy things up. All right, so they're negative free cash flow. They just turned positive. What do these guys do? transforming organ transplant therapy for endstage organ failure patients. So organ transplants So they must have done some acquisitions here because the revenues have gone bananas. The share count going up a lot. Earnings I mean this is more of a growth story. They just finally got positive free cash flow for the first time. stockbased compensation. I It's okay. It's a growth story. It's not what we do. I mean, I would have been more interested at $20 when no one wanted it than at $123 when everyone's starting to want it. But it could probably go higher. Not for me, though. Tim and welcome to the podcast. Tim Cowan uh leading service provider in specialty foods. It's Brazil. a zealous group. NB. The revenues have dropped like 25 30%. Wait, that that must have been cash flow. Let's take a look at the cash flow. Yeah, it's cash flow drop, but it's still pretty robust. Uh 4.9 billion sheet. I think it's worth exploring more, but um you're gonna have to do a lot of work. I mean, on the surface, it looks okay. Albert, thanks for sending in. Albert Ruddle. Uh, I hope all the people that view your podcast for your opinions will also take away your example as how you properly raise your girls. Well, thank you. I mean, my wife has a lot to do that with that as well, so give credit where credit's due with Caitlyn. Um, I just try to lead by example. Uh, as for my AMA query back in May, I inquired about Owings Cordon. You said maybe interesting under 100. It's now in the high 90s. Would you be interested at this level now? See you in Sarasota. Okay. Who's that? Albert. Okay. Oh, see getting closer. Maybe in the 90. Maybe in the low 90s. Um, let's take a look here. They do have a lot of debt. Four billion of debt. 1.4 billion in receivables. 280 million in cash. What's going on with the free cash flow? It's decent. A billion. Revenues are growing. negative earnings share count coming down. Yeah, I think maybe another 10% lower I'd get more interested, but probably wouldn't do anything anyway. Chris Williamson. Relley Global. What do they do? digital financial crossber remittances. Yeah. I mean I just don't So this is people sending money back to the people at home. The problem is all the people that use these things like Western Union are all getting deported. So I I wouldn't the numbers look fine but I don't think I I think the trend is away from you. Sea Star Medical 80% chance of a $5 billion market at 90% margins available for $1 million. Uh this is a guess on the future. Let's see. And in the meantime, it burns non-stop cash. Hard pass. If I want to gamble, I'll go to Vegas. And chances are, if I'm in Vegas, I'm going to just be eating steaks and going to shows anyway. I I I'll play poker, though, because I actually have a chance of doing something there. But, um, all right. Thoughts? All unemployment indications increasing big tech layoffs. Challenger ADP increase a tipping point mass layoffs as spending dives. Something more benign. Something more benign. Uh Alibaba dips after White House memo claims it's helping Chinese military target US. Yeah. And then the next day said we might have a US China deal in the next two weeks. So that was a leak for the purpose of putting pressure on getting a deal done and all of a sudden that went away. Tim Wang, listener of your podcast every week for a few years now. Thank you. Thank you for continuing to provide so much value to the audience through your podcast every single week so consistently. Uh would you please look at Souls spin-off from Honeywell? Thank you. All right, Tim. Let's take a look. Thanks for your loyal support and I'm glad you are getting great value cooling technology. Is this it? Oh, souls. S O L S. Okay. Yeah, this is an early spin. Let me see if the balance if they loaded it with debt or not. Billion of cash and receivables. No, that looks okay. Looks okay. Specialty chemicals and advanced materials company operates refrigerants and applied solutions. Special material, low global warming, refrigerants, blow agents, aerosol, blowing aerosol, cleaning solvents, packaging materials, laboratories, or planes. So, it's a spin-off from Honeywell. Um, it's not something I would do, but I, you know, spin-offs tend to outperform over time. If you read the, u book from Joel Greenblat, it's that yellow book. I forget what it's called. Um, this looks okay. It's not something I would do. John Rodriguez, Mr. Hayes, I saw on your YouTube stating that Steph Curry And now, okay, so you were right. Okay, so yeah, I I basically said if Under Armour can't sell shoes with Steph Curry and Tom Brady, there's no hope for them. And two days later, Steph Curry resigned and went signed with Nike. So that tells you everything you need to know. Thanks. Uh, appreciate that. Um, Ivan, no, it's a guy that wants me on the podcast. Michael Gibbons. Oh, yeah. I already talked to you about getting started. What's your opinion on the new Koi earnings call AI summary? Shortcuts don't work. You need to understand the nuance. You could do it for a quick read, but you got to do the real work. Tim D. Uh Tim, I'll answer that another time. So, the fact that you sent in that uh gives you some benefit. Uh Andrew, hi Tom, your podcast is the best one out there. Thank you. Uh can't wait for Thursdays. Can you take a look at Mandi Mndi? Yes, I can. Andrew Rutherford and thank you for the kind words. Negative free cash flow. What do they do? Packaging and paper solutions in Africa. Yeah, I don't really like the paper business. I know it's down a lot, but I'm going to pass on that one. It would have to come down a lot more for me to get interested. Let me just take a look at the free cash. Oh, first the balance sheet. 197 million 2.5 billion. It's a little overlevered, too. No, I'm going to pass on that one. LGH. This is from Eet Nam Homebuilder. I don't know if these have come down enough. Not yet. Still burning too much cash. Let's see. One quarter positive cash flow and we'll talk. Um, okay. Frederick Frederick Hammerstrom. Hey, Tom. Frederick from Beers and Baba here. I remember these guys. Take a look at TUI. They changed their operating model which drives higher margins unlock value. Also, big thanks for all you've taught me. It has made me financially stable enough to quit my job at a big four and launch a startup together with a friend. Congratulations. That's exciting. All right, TUI. Huh? Okay, this is a tiny company, so you're dealing with some risk here, partner. But, uh, let's take a look at solveny risk first. 1.7 billion of debt. They've got a lot of cash. out of free cash flow. This Why did they Why did they dilute you so much? I mean, the share count is up 10x in five years. This is your problem. The business looks fine. I don't I just don't know why the share count 10xed. So, they must have done some deals or something. Let's see. Was there an abrupt jump in revenues? Yeah. So, they did a lot. They did a big deal for stock. Uh, hotels and resorts. Oh, this is the Ryu. This is the whole vacation resort business. Yeah. Uh, I just don't like that they use that much stock for an acquisition. I don't love this type of business. I know why you're interested. It's It's probably okay. It's not for me, partner. But, um, let's just see here. I don't know. It's It's not the type of business I like, but If you can get comfortable that they're done deluding you and that the business is going to continue to improve, I don't have a problem with it. I think your general analysis of it is okay and uh on that basis, good luck with your startup and um thank you for your support. Bob Balmart. Puma turnaround candidate. This has to be a European guy. I I just have at it. I just don't like Puma, period. It's just uh I know it's a European thing like Adidas, but I don't understand it. I'm going to pass. It doesn't mean it won't work. Looks generally okay, but it's not for me. Looks like it's another Reebok headed to the toilet, but I I think I'll be wrong about that. Uh, whirlpool stock. No. Uh, McKenzie Osine, just wanted to say I appreciate I'm appreciative of what you do. Look forward to your video cast every week. Do not miss an episode. When the student is ready, the teacher appear. hoping you could give me your opinion on Oscar health. This is uh Kushner's brother's thing. This is a complicated thing because it's a new entrant and all the numbers seem to look okay healthcare technology platform systems campaign. I mean the other thing you got to be careful if the subsidies are going away what what kind of impact there there's too much guesswork in this for me to be interested but the numbers look okay assuming none of the policy changes it's a grower free cash yeah I mean I don't have anything overtly wrong with it, but it's not for me because you're just guessing on the future. And um but again, I don't think you get hurt, but it's I think there are higher and better uses. Paul Hal BWXT. Yeah. No, Paul. Absolutely not. I I wouldn't be a buyer this year at all. Uh NBIS. This is from Matt Del Priori. No. What the hell is this? Some type of promoted stock? Just No. No. Um Ryan Church and Dwight. Ryan, on a side note, I was re So he asked about church and Dwight. On a side note, I was recommended your podcast earlier this year and found it incredibly valuable. I've learned so much. I've already recommended the podcast to at least five different people. Thank you, Ryan. I appreciate that. Let's do Church and Dwight. I mean, this one I mean, this fits exactly what we're talking about with um you're not going to get a double anytime soon, but you can make 50% over the next few years and not get hurt. Um, and this fits the defensive shoot first, ask questions later, consistent compounder over time. I think it's okay here. I mean, if you could get it at 80, you know, you're you're splitting hairs here. I mean, if you can get a few bucks lower, but you're not going to make a fortune off this either. Uh, but it's a compounder over time, I think it's a solid pick. This is what you'd buy if you were Warren Buffett and had billions of free float coming in every single month and had to buy great businesses at good prices. But if you want to make buy good businesses at great prices and and get doubles and triples every few years, uh this is not going to qualify. Uh great. Thanks for the great This is from Matt Gower. Thanks for the great podcast you consistently put out. Great to hear your ideas and perspective. Can you look at United Homes Group? Uh small southeast home builder. I think you guys are a little earlier on the early on these home builders. 25 million of cash, 140 million of debt. Just got to see when that debt is due. Revenue is holding up. What is this share share growth though? This is the problem. They're just issuing shares like it's going out of style, giving a bunch of them to themselves. That's problematic. I don't like that. No, I'm going to pass on this one. Alex asks about NOV versus uh slumberj. We chose NOV because it had more upside. Slumberge had less risk but um the balance sheet and the free cash flow improved and we liked it. So that's why we got involved there. So slumberj is another good option but it's not as good as uh national oil well vvarco in terms of upside and uh it got to the point also that I mean slumberj you could buy here but it got to the point also that um the conditions were setting up for an inflection in the sector at extremes and it was time to find what could we make the most amount of money uh per dollar invested and it was a better return with equivalent if not probably equivalent risk. So that's why we went with Varco over slumberj even though slumberj is a bit higher quality. Um I don't know what day see what day did we do the last podcast was on December 11th. Okay. So, I don't have to do the ones on the 11th, I guess. Let's just make sure. HT Oh, this is from Lucas. HTLD. It must have come in after the podcast. Yeah, I'm gonna pass on this. Been listening four years. Appreciate all the insight. Recommend the podcast. Trex. Uh, dine. I I talked about earlier. We almost did that one, but we don't like the CEO. and um TX. I think we covered that one. Yeah, I think it's early though. That is a falling knife. Wait for a quarter of free cash before you play with that one. Um wondering if you have any opinions on emerging market ETFs. Really like K web for Chinat. Yeah, ETFs it's fine. Brendan does a good job running that. Brendan Ahernie is a friend. If you like ETFs should be fine. Uh UV, this is from Basim Hussein. What's the other one? Axia A. I mean, you're asking me to buy stocks that are breaking out. That's not what we do here. Um, yeah, it's fine. I mean, you might be paying for a lot of that already, so I don't think you're going to make a lot of money off those, but I don't think you're going to get too hurt either. We covered that. Okay, we're done. We'll be back next week. Same time, same place. In the meantime, uh well, I don't know if it's going to be the same day. I think next week is Thanksgiving, so we'll probably do it a day before. Uh, in the meantime, make it a great one. Bye for now. [Music] [Music] Heat. Heat. [Music] [Music]
