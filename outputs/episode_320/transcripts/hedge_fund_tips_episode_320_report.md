### December 4th, 2025

**Executive Summary**
> Tom Hayes is extremely bullish on healthcare, dividend payers, and small caps, particularly in the face of a potentially choppy midterm election year. He emphasizes buying 'good businesses at great prices,' focusing on companies with strong cash flow and turnaround potential. He highlights Fizer, Papa John's, Crown Castle, Baxter International, Comstock Resources, and Cooper Standard as key opportunities.

**Tom's Current Market Conviction: Bullish, but selective → 8/10** 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥☆☆

- 90% chance of a Fed cut
- Quantitative tightening is over
- 316 global central bank cuts in 2025
- Double-digit earnings growth for 2026

## Macro Thesis & Key Data Points
Hayes believes that the market has already priced in much of the expected volatility, and that the Fed is likely to cut rates, providing further liquidity and support for growth. He anticipates a rotation into defensive sectors and dividend-paying stocks as rates recompress and investors seek yield. He also sees a potential for small caps to outperform as the Fed eases.

| Indicator | Value | Tom's Interpretation |
|-----------|-------|----------------------|
| Midterm Election Years S&P Performance | Historically up 2.4% with a 17.3% drawdown | Believes this time will be different due to corrections already experienced. |
| Global Central Bank Cuts | 316 in 2025 | Hard to fight that amount of liquidity. |
| Money Market Funds | $7 trillion earning 4% | This money will be forced into the market looking for yield as rates recompress. |
