[00:00:00] Welcome to Hedge Fund Tips with Tom Hayes. I'm Tom Hayes and this is your 320th videocast podcast for the
[00:00:08] weekending December 4th, 2025. Live from New York City. Excited to get back to
[00:00:13] California tonight after a week of travel. Uh as always, family first and we'll get down to business. Uh that's
[00:00:19] Caitlyn and I at uh one of the events. Uh then with the girls at the hockey
[00:00:24] game. Unbelievable time at the Anaheim Ducks, by the way. Was super. Got those tickets. Uh, I wanted a charity auction.
[00:00:30] We're going to be going to more Ducks games moving forward. Didn't realize how popular hockey was in California. That's
[00:00:36] the fam in front of the Christmas tree. Uh, beautiful picture of Mimi and Annabelle. That's my new buddy George,
[00:00:43] who I got to play golf with in uh in Florida with Mike Bennett. You all know Mike Bennett. Uh, friend of mine that I
[00:00:50] play with all the time and um uh just one of the best ball strikers in the history of golf. Uh, look him up. Mike
[00:00:58] Bennett Stack and Tilt. He wrote the book. This is Caitlyn going crazy with the holiday decorations this year, which
[00:01:03] is always great. Then my fam came to see me over in Sarasota at the Money Show.
[00:01:09] That's Uncle Joe, Aunt Rilene, my cousin Leticia, who is just incredible. Uh, and
[00:01:16] we just had a fun time and they got to see some of the stuff. That's Caitlyn, uh, who lives by the credo. Uh, there
[00:01:23] can never be enough ornaments on one Christmas tree. and uh she did a phenomenal job. Of course, that's at the
[00:01:29] money show in Sarasota. That's the half of the breakout room. I was that was
[00:01:34] amazing. Uh we had uh quite a lot of people in the breakout room because that's not advertised. It's not like the
[00:01:40] keynote two uh sections that I had where the room is, you know, a thousand people uh to fill that was very very humbling
[00:01:47] and uh very grateful for that. Uh that's down on the New York Stock Exchange.
[00:01:52] There's Diane King Hall in the background. Uh, there's Diane. That's the Christmas tree out front. New York
[00:01:59] Stock Exchange. I It never gets old for me. Uh, there's Annabelle skating in California. While I was gone, she said
[00:02:05] it was fake ice. You can see here it's probably that plastic ice, but what an incredible job they did over there.
[00:02:10] There's Caitlyn at the same event with Annabelle. Ah, there's Rob came with his
[00:02:16] hedge fund tips hat to Sarasota. Super excited. Uh, he got up on the website.
[00:02:22] We'll talk about that. There's Albert and his wife Joanne with their not only their hat, shirt, and mug. And I always
[00:02:30] say, guys, it's just so helpful. If for nothing else, uh if you never do any
[00:02:36] business with me, which is which is fine. Uh just if you're getting value,
[00:02:41] all I ask is share it with one person you care about who loves markets. And as we continue to grow, we'll continue to
[00:02:48] do these for you, whether you're ever a client or not. Uh and uh um it really
[00:02:54] makes a difference because we've gotten so many great people into the community out of your generosity in sharing, not
[00:03:01] being selfish and keeping it to yourself, but actually sharing as we try to do here in the community has been
[00:03:06] phenomenal. So, uh that's that. And then finally, uh back in New York, you can
[00:03:12] see the holiday spirit at uh News Corp. Ah, that's with my mom. Uh had her in
[00:03:17] for dinner last night with my brother. We had a great time. Uh, and what else? Ah, there's Kristen
[00:03:25] Scher. Always enjoy talking to her at NYSC live. That's the Christmas tree at
[00:03:30] Fox. The holiday spirit is in full blast. New York Stock Exchange. Uh, and
[00:03:36] so on. So, down to business. Uh, first I joined I'm going to go in order this
[00:03:42] week. I joined Diane King Hall on Schwab Network live at the New York Stock
[00:03:49] Exchange. uh covered some new names that a lot of you guys have been trying to ask me. Uh they're out. Uh we were able
[00:03:57] to get everyone set up and uh so now we're um going to go through that. Well,
[00:04:03] uh first off, thanks to Diane, thanks to Maya for having me on and the whole team over there at Schwab Network listening
[00:04:09] here. A look at the outlook for markets into next year. Let's welcome in our next guest. We've got Tom Hayes, chairman and
[00:04:15] managing member at Great Hill Capital joining us. Tom, it is so good to see you. Great to be here, Dan.
[00:04:21] Um, okay. So, let's talk before we get into outlook for next year, let's talk a little bit about December. Uh, is
[00:04:28] seasonality on the side of the bulls? It tends to be. You know, uh, we've got
[00:04:33] now a 90% chance of a Fed cut. If we don't get that cut for some crazy reason, then I'd be worried. Other than
[00:04:39] that, I think liquidity is there. Quantitative tightening is over, which means potentially quantitative easing
[00:04:46] could be coming in. certainly more liquidity. We had 316
[00:04:52] global central bank cuts in 2025. So, it's hard to fight that amount of
[00:04:57] liquidity and then you've got earnings growth for 2026. Pretty pretty uh well set double-digit earnings growth. Uh
[00:05:04] hard to get bearish, but you know, you can have some pockets of surprises and I think that's why you want to be selective.
[00:05:10] Okay, so you want to be selective. What does that mean? Well, if we look at the
[00:05:17] uh midterm election years historically, it tends to be the worst year of the
[00:05:23] presidential cycle. Uh on average up 2.4% for the S&P on average draw down of
[00:05:30] 17.3%. So that doesn't sound too good. However, I think we're going to get a little bit
[00:05:36] of relief this time. And that's because historically you get a 20% correction
[00:05:42] every 3.5 years since 2028. We've had three of since 20 2018.
[00:05:48] 1928. 1928. I was like 2028, we're not there yet. We in crystal ball territory.
[00:05:54] My flight got in. So, uh, okay. Since 1928, go ahead. So we've had
[00:06:01] average every 3.5 years. We've had three of those in the last 5 years. I think we've pulled forward a lot of that 10
[00:06:08] years worth of 20% corrections. So would it be normal to get um you know 10%
[00:06:13] correction? Sure. We get one every 13 months. Um I do think while the S&P underperforms in those midterm election
[00:06:20] years, you know what outperforms is what's been the most dramatic unper underperformer in recent years, which is
[00:06:27] healthcare. While the S&P does 2.4% 4% you know it does 9% in a midterm
[00:06:33] election year is healthcare. So we want to we want to look there and we also want to look defensives because uh the
[00:06:40] dividend payers are what's going to start to work in a defensive environment and in a central bank easing
[00:06:46] environment. So okay so let's dive into it for healthcare. Um I'm not surprised to hear
[00:06:51] you say healthcare and I can see it as a basket but there's one that you like and this does surprise me. That's fizer. I'll
[00:06:58] give it away. Um because listen, Fizer hasn't performed in years, even during co times. Yes, it performed well, but
[00:07:06] not as well as at the time that this is obviously a different cycle now, but like Merna um and so at the time that
[00:07:12] was obviously about vaccines. Fiser doesn't have a weight loss drug contender to compete with, you know, uh
[00:07:18] Eli Liy. I'm putting Novo, but even though Novo has strengthened it, it's
[00:07:24] it's not strengthened the share price. Yes. So, what is it about Fizer that you like? Okay. Uh, number one, they just did the
[00:07:30] Metsera deal for $10 billion, which has a monthly GLP1, so you don't have to do
[00:07:36] it uh every week or or whatever is the normal case. Uh, they also have the possibility of an oral GLP1. And if
[00:07:44] they're the ones to do it, it is game over, lights out. Now, that's all speculative. We're not worried about
[00:07:49] that. We're That's just the cherry on the Sunday. What are we talking about here? CGEN, four new uh oncology drugs.
[00:07:57] They've cut a tremendous amount of costs. People are worried about the patent cliff for Eloquis and some of the
[00:08:03] other drugs. They're take they've taken $7.2 billion of costs out of the business. They're paying a dividend of
[00:08:10] 7% while you wait. It's trading at eight times forward earnings. And guess what's been happening in the last couple years?
[00:08:16] Cheap. It's cheap. And margins are reacelerating.
[00:08:21] growth is reacelerating. So, people looked at this. The great thing about co is they built
[00:08:27] up a lot of cash to do deals like CGen, like Meter, they're back in the game. Uh
[00:08:32] Borla, I could take them or leave them. You know, Warren Buffett once said, uh, you know, buy a business that's so good
[00:08:38] a ham sandwich could run it because one day a ham sandwich will run it. Look, he got us the vaccine, uh, during co, so
[00:08:44] give him credit for that. But to your point, it's been a sleeper for a long time. Yeah. But there's there's there's that's
[00:08:50] when activists show up. That's when things get shaken up. That's why he's been doing the cost cuts. That's why he's been doing the deals. They've got
[00:08:56] the urgency on it. And uh and it's and it's reacelerating. So I think he can even pull it off. And uh on that basis,
[00:09:03] we'll collect the seven 7% dividend till those weight loss drugs kick in. 2028, the oncology drugs kick in, the cost
[00:09:10] cuts kick in, the buybacks kick in, and I collect 7%. We'll keep revisiting this one because I want you have been right
[00:09:16] on some that that I've and that's why I love listening because there have been some I'm like okay you were right on
[00:09:21] that one. Let's talk you also like um Papa John's right. Papa John's baby this is a new one.
[00:09:28] People are going to go crazy for this. So uh consumer discretionary managers cut it by the most in history. That
[00:09:34] sector uh people are down on the consumer. Consumer sentiment is low. I'm telling you the consumer is doing well.
[00:09:40] They've got a new CEO that was from Wendy's. He ran Wendy's when Nelson Peltz was turning around the company.
[00:09:47] Three Bagger during his tenure from 2016 to 2024. They are refin uh refranchising
[00:09:55] uh 85 units in the UK that were company owned. Getting rid of all the company owned. That doesn't work. They're a cap
[00:10:00] cap uh capex light business cuz it's all franchising fees. Uh better ingredients
[00:10:06] comp store sales. They sound like they're commercial. Better ingredients, better pizza. Sorry. Listen,
[00:10:13] uh, comp store sales up 2% and by the way, you get a 4.5%
[00:10:18] dividend yield while you wait. Why am I so keen on the dividend? Because in a, uh, dividend payers as a whole and
[00:10:24] defensives, uh, are the most undervalued that they've been in 25 years, uh, as
[00:10:30] rates recompress, all that money, $7 trillion of money markets is going to be forced into the market. What are they
[00:10:36] looking for? They're looking for yield. Your downside is protected with these inexpensive stocks. Your upside is is
[00:10:42] meaningful. Uh you get paid while you wait. And I love a good turnaround story. As you know,
[00:10:47] you do. I'm more convinced on Fizer. I'm a I'm still I'm going to do this for
[00:10:53] We sent out almost a hundred gift cards to our clients. Every year we send them something from one of our portfolio
[00:10:59] holdings. All these wealthy guy guys and gals are eating Papa John's for the
[00:11:04] holidays. Last year I sent them van shoes for VF court. Okay. And uh it's
[00:11:09] going to be a good year for Papa John's. And what happens if you do get those tariff dividend checks? If the Supreme Court votes against tariffs and he pays
[00:11:16] that out, where does all that go? It goes straight into consumer discretionary. They're going to be buying vans from Brack and Daryl over
[00:11:22] court. They're going to be buying Papa John's like it's going out of business. All right, we'll have to leave a we'll
[00:11:28] have to bookmark our conversation for Tom. Tom, I always enjoy talking to you. Wonderful D. Yes. I love it. That's Tom
[00:11:36] Hayes, managing member at Grey Hill Capital and chairman over there.
[00:11:41] And we're back. Then I had the pleasure right after to join uh Kristen Scher
[00:11:47] who's just phenomenal. Uh and uh covered in a little different twist. Uh terrific
[00:11:54] information here. Thanks to Kristen and Mel Montana. We'll listen in here. And joining me now with more is Thomas
[00:12:00] Hayes. He's chairman and managing member at Grey Hill Capital. Thomas, great to see you. Great to be back. Thanks, Kristen.
[00:12:06] Uh, good to talk in early December. Historically, a strong month for stocks.
[00:12:11] What do you see in the markets right now? I think we have gotten through the worst of it. You know, normally when you have
[00:12:16] those 15% intraear corrections, uh, and then you rally to all-time highs. The secondary correction is 6.5%. That's
[00:12:24] exactly what we got. So, the only thing that could mess this up if is if we get a surprise next week with the Fed. It
[00:12:29] doesn't look like that. Even after the the jobs numbers this morning, uh 88% chance of a cut. If that's the case,
[00:12:35] you've got quantitative tightening ended uh in December, which uh usually precedes the beginning of uh some level
[00:12:42] of quantitative easing. We'll see what happens there. Uh we've had 316 global
[00:12:47] central banks cutting this year, which is even more than the great financial crisis. Very tough to fight that
[00:12:53] liquidity, double-digit earnings growth. So that's all the good news, rainbows and unicorns. What's the bad news? The bad news is midterm election years tend
[00:13:00] to be the worst year of the 4-year presidential cycle. Uh S&P 500 up on average 2.4% only. Average correction in
[00:13:08] a midterm election year 17.3%. Uh I don't think we're going to get that
[00:13:14] though. Do you know why? On average uh every 3.5 years you get a 20%
[00:13:20] correction. We've had three of those in the last 5 years. I think we've pulled forward a lot of that 10 years worth of
[00:13:26] 20% corrections. So, I think a more modest uh 10% pullbacks is normal every 13 months. Uh but there is one
[00:13:34] particular group, Kristen, that while the S&P underperforms 2.4%
[00:13:39] tends to outperform at 9% in and that is
[00:13:44] that is healthare. Healthcare. Yeah. Which you couldn't give away. You couldn't give away healthcare for
[00:13:49] the last three years. Lowest weight in the S&P in years. lowest relative PE
[00:13:55] relative to the S&P 500 in 25 years. It had uh lowest relative valuation hasn't
[00:14:01] been this hated since 2000, the last time we had this level of concentration
[00:14:07] in the top 10 stocks and for the next 5 6 7 years healthcare dramatically
[00:14:13] outperformed. The other benefit of healthcare, a lot of them are dividend payers which tend to excel in easing
[00:14:20] cycles because people get forced out uh on the risk curve as those money markets
[00:14:25] go from 4 and a half with your eyes closed to four to three and a half to three and people say I need dividend
[00:14:31] yield. Where do they go? They go to defensives like healthcare. They go to uh staples. They go to dividend payers
[00:14:37] which are also at their lowest valuation most hated in 25 years. We love those
[00:14:42] areas that no one wants and then when they want them it it happens all at once. It's interesting, Thomas, and I'm
[00:14:48] curious in terms of your perspective as to how many rate cuts we might be getting next year that could boost this
[00:14:54] thesis. Ah, let me pull out my crystal ball. Uh, look, I think we've got to go to 3% uh
[00:15:00] is kind of the neutral rate. So, a couple more cuts uh after December would be uh part for the course. However, we
[00:15:06] do have this this gentleman named Kevin Hasset coming to bear. And uh I think the the theme is uh as low as you can
[00:15:13] get without inflation starting to aggressively creep above 3%. That 2%
[00:15:19] target is going to be a forgotten figure I think in the foreseeable future. I think 3 325 I think they'll be even
[00:15:26] comfortable with 3 1/2. And it's interesting postw World War II was the last time we have we had debt to GDP
[00:15:33] 120%. They did run inflation hot for the next half a decade. uh 3 to 5% and that
[00:15:40] brought down that aggressive growth and deregulatory policies brought down debt to GDP from 120% down to 63%
[00:15:49] by 1957. So maybe that's the playbook. Let it run a little hot, but let growth run hot. Let animal spirits come back.
[00:15:56] Uh make a favorable environment with interest rates. Companies can refinance. Companies can invest and uh and that
[00:16:02] would be a very positive thing. I'm curious to hear your view on cryptocurrency because amid some of the
[00:16:07] choppiness that we saw in November, at the same time, we had seen Bitcoin drop pretty dramatically. Now, of course, the
[00:16:13] past few days, it has shown signs of bouncing back. But do you see a correlation at all between the
[00:16:19] cryptocurrency market, Bitcoin in particular, and what's happening in equities? I I do think so because there's a lot of
[00:16:25] embedded leverage in both trades. It's kind of a risk on asset uh when animal spirits come back. Although, you did
[00:16:31] have this recent divergence. So people are like, "What's going on? Was there deleveraging? Was someone blowing up?" When people don't know, they get
[00:16:37] nervous. They shoot first, ask questions later. Um, you know, so it's it's a proky proxy for risk appetite. I I
[00:16:44] really won't say a lot more than that because it's outside of my lane. Uh, I just like buying great companies when
[00:16:50] they're on sale. Yeah. What else are you watching to that end? Well, I like two defensive Well, one's
[00:16:56] defensive, one's a little bit defensive dividend payers. One pays 7% yield, one pays 4.5% yield with tremendous upside
[00:17:04] potential in the price on top of it. First is Fizer. You can't give away Fizer. Uh they collected a lot of money
[00:17:11] during co that's now uh uh decelerated. It's only 14% of revenues, but they did
[00:17:17] the $10 billion Medsera deal, which is going to be a once a month uh GLP uh
[00:17:22] both uh shot and eventually oral, which would be an absolute gamecher. The CGEN deal is starting to bear fruit for
[00:17:28] oncology drugs. They've cut a tremendous amount of cost. There's activist involvement. Margins are reacelerating.
[00:17:34] Revenues are reacelerating. Uh trading just at eight times earnings and 7%
[00:17:39] yield while you wait. We love that on the dividend payer theme, on the healthcare theme, on the choppy midterm
[00:17:44] election year theme. It fits. It checks all the boxes. The second one is pizza. Papa John's. Okay. Turnaround story. The
[00:17:51] CEO came from Wendy's. While he was there under Nelson Peltz turning around the company threebagger under his
[00:17:56] toutelage he's now at Papa John's refinancing stores uh uh selling company
[00:18:02] stores all franchising model comp stores are now growing 2% ingredients are better everyone loves pizza and god
[00:18:08] forbid you get the Trump dividend if the Supreme Court votes against tariffs all that $2,000 is going to Papa John's
[00:18:14] pizza I'm telling you that right now Thomas hey joining me in studio he's chairman and managing member of Great
[00:18:20] Hill Capital Thomas thank you as Always. Thank you. All right, everyone.
[00:18:25] And we're back. And then I got to join the Big Money Show, which is a lot of
[00:18:31] fun. We cut out uh a lot of the segments so we could just get down to the the parts that uh you might want to hear.
[00:18:38] And we'll listen. I want to thank as always Madison Myrtto who's been
[00:18:44] phenomenal. Obviously, Brian Brenberg and Jackie D'Angelus uh and Taylor Riggs and and Dan McDow.
[00:18:52] Thanks for having me on. We're gonna listen in here. Time's up for Vanian Company.
[00:18:58] Be paying income tax. Welcome to the Big Money Show. I'm Dan McDow along with my co-hosts Taylor
[00:19:05] Riggs, Brian Benberg, Jackie D'Angelus, and with us for this hour, Great Hill Capital Chairman Thomas Hayes. Great to
[00:19:12] see you. Not only is the that is less than two months of that is the definition of insanity.
[00:19:18] I think this is all about direction not destination. We know the math doesn't add up but it's it's the idea of
[00:19:25] progrowth policies. And furthermore, this is really just an advertisement to the Supreme Court. If you unwind these
[00:19:32] tariffs, I'm just going to pay it out as dividends, baby. If you keep it, I'm going to pay I'm going to pay down debt.
[00:19:38] So, we can pay down the debt one of two ways. We can have massive growth through handing out these dividend checks, in
[00:19:44] which case we're going to inflate it away, or we can be responsible about it and keep the tariff income coming in and
[00:19:50] we will use that money to pay down debt. Up to you, Mr. and Mrs. Supreme Court. That's the way it's going to be. But the
[00:19:56] the name of the game here is people are afraid afraid of inflation. They're afraid of yields and it's recency bias.
[00:20:02] What we had with COVID inflation was a unique situation of ongoing checks and
[00:20:09] supply chain disruption and people locked in their house with nothing else to do but order goods. Uh that's not
[00:20:15] going to be the case this time predominantly because of the most important policy which is the energy policy. You keep energy low.
[00:20:22] The Saudis respect this administration. They have been towing the line and
[00:20:27] keeping production up. If oil stays down, they can get away with murder. They can hand out dividend checks till
[00:20:32] the cows come home. The supply chain is not going to be disrupted and we are going to grow above trend just like we
[00:20:38] did post World War II. The last time we had debt to GDP at 120% we basically
[00:20:44] grew our way and inflated a little bit 3 to 5% inflation within by 1957 debt to
[00:20:50] GDP dropped to 63% from growth and letting the economy run hot like Larry
[00:20:55] Cuddlo always says let it rip. And that's exactly what this administration's going to do with the
[00:21:01] dream team of Hasset and Bessant. Um Oh, that's your prediction.
[00:21:07] I think that's the way it's going to go. He's going to go as low. He He's going to be like, "We shall discuss this."
[00:21:12] Yeah. Yeah. The getting away with murder. That was figurative. Um we have yet to have a response from
[00:21:19] Amazon. But it is a scenario that is playing out across the country. And in many cases, city and county leaders say,
[00:21:26] "You know what? The upside of these data centers is just too good to turn down,
[00:21:31] guys. Back to you, Ashley Webster. Appreciate it. Tom, do you agree? Is the upside too good to
[00:21:36] pass up or do you hear the the risks? I think the upside is too good to pass
[00:21:42] up, but you can't play the obvious plays. You have to pay play the derivative plays, the pick and shovels. Uh we've played this this year massively
[00:21:49] through comtock resources, natural gas play, cheapest, lowest cost producer of natural gas. That's going to drive the
[00:21:54] energy for for the data center boom. We played it through the least popular play which was Intel which happened to be the
[00:22:01] second best AI performer this year. Outperformed Nvidia this year. They make
[00:22:06] basic chips for data centers. Then you got GenerRack. They have the number one standby generator commercial generator
[00:22:13] backup power for these data centers which is absolutely critical. No one's even paying attention because they say,
[00:22:18] "Oh, there weren't hurricanes in Florida. Therefore, sell Generrack." They're thinking about the home standby generators. They've got a half a billion
[00:22:24] dollar backlog just in data center backup demand. And then finally, you you take uh a simple company like Brad
[00:22:31] Jacobs, QXO, building supplies. All of these are going to need roofs. They're going to need building materials. And uh
[00:22:37] and this this game, this theme is just beginning. So don't play the obvious. The the data center uh vehicles are very
[00:22:44] very crowded. The obvious AI players are very very crowded, overvalued. Play the
[00:22:49] nonobvious players where you're going to see margin expansion. You're going to see revenue growth and you're going to see earnings go go really accelerate and
[00:22:56] the stock go up. Den, one thing that was we all know that stubborn inflation, a slowing job market and a fractured board of governors
[00:23:03] making America's fiscal future very uncertain. So, you hinted to that a little bit before, Tom. You believe that
[00:23:09] it was not some sort of a slip up, but that it was intentional. That's who the Fed chair will be. talk to me about what
[00:23:14] you think um the world will look like in 2026 with Kevin Hasset at as a Fed chair
[00:23:20] as we're dealing with um ADP data today that showed a little bit of a slow private sector employment shed 32,000
[00:23:28] jobs 32,000 in November. It gives them cover. If you've uh if you
[00:23:33] know a little bit about limbo, if you went to college and frat parties, it's going to be President Trump on one side
[00:23:38] of the stick, Scott Besson on the other side, and Kevin Hasset, and they're going to be saying, "How low can you go?
[00:23:43] How low can you go?" And Hasset's going to say, "I can go lower. I can go lower." That's what he's going to do. You really
[00:23:49] think Hass is just going to be a cut cut all politics? Not all politics. All grounded in
[00:23:55] economic data. We've got to get people into starter homes. We've got to get the housing economy, 18% of GDP, back
[00:24:03] humming again. We've got to get small businesses humming. You know what thrives when you cut rates? Small caps.
[00:24:09] Smaller businesses can refinance debt, take solveny risk off the table, grow, expand. You want these data centers to
[00:24:15] build out to give us a competitive advantage. You need low debt financing. Okay? Uh and uh and they're going to do
[00:24:22] this all. And if they get a little inflation, they'll produce more oil. If that doesn't work, they can stop cutting. But uh you're also going to
[00:24:28] have um uh Secretary Bessant uh working the long end of the curve. They have tools in their toolbox like uh Operation
[00:24:36] Twist. If they need to if the if the long end starts to blow out, they can control the short end. If the bond end
[00:24:41] doesn't cooperate on the long end, the the Treasury can get in there. Okay. A couple of points there that Tom
[00:24:46] makes, Brian. Um I like this idea of lower rates if it's warranted based on the data. But then when you start
[00:24:52] talking about operation twist y and other engineering, I'm starting to think back to 2008 after the crisis. We took
[00:25:00] interest rates down to zero. We were expanding the balance sheet. I I I don't actually like all of that massaging to
[00:25:06] make it work. I think the pieces should come together a little bit more naturally. So you let's have transparent targets.
[00:25:14] Here's what we're going to do. Actually invite more public comment, right? but narrow the mandate of the Fed down,
[00:25:20] which I think everybody can agree. They shouldn't be talking about climate change or whatever else. So, I I I think
[00:25:25] that critics of Hassid and Trump want to paint him as a just cut cut to appease
[00:25:30] the president. I don't think he's going to be that kind of guy. Yeah. I I think there's something else that is a major development in December,
[00:25:36] which is quantitative tightening has ended. Okay. So, they're not no longer selling into the market. there's
[00:25:43] actually going to be a bid and that's going to help control the long end a little bit and give them a more natural
[00:25:48] latitude because they're not natural sellers into the market uh to for the for the uh further end out on the curve
[00:25:54] to be tame while they move into this more normalized uh position. Remember,
[00:26:00] we're still 100 basis points uh above inflation restrictive uh on policy. So,
[00:26:06] there's some room to cut and to really drive growth here. I'm not saying we need to go back down to zero. If we go down to zero, it's because the economy
[00:26:12] has collapsed. So, that's not where we're going to go. But, we got to go to neutral and let growth and animal
[00:26:17] spirits back into the picture. And uh and I think that's going to happen pretty quickly. Taylor, what say you about the wages?
[00:26:23] We're up 4.4% year-over-year. That's better than the overall average when we look at it.
[00:26:28] Right. A lot of that is, you know, for small businesses, their debt service has doubled in the last two years from
[00:26:34] Powell. And we're waiting for a massive refinancing wave, which I think we're going to start to see in 2026 because
[00:26:39] the market once you once you know it's the market's going to start to price that in. They'll be able to hit the market and they'll be able to go back
[00:26:45] into expansion mode versus survival mode with huge debt service payments. It's it's been uh very ownorous particularly
[00:26:51] on small caps which tend to be the most leveraged unfortunately. What do you think? Um we can't let China do it. We can't
[00:26:58] let Russia do it. Everybody wants to do it. But let's show the world how smart we truly are. And we are also the
[00:27:04] wealthiest nation in the world. So, put your money where your mouth is and get it done. Tom, quick last thought.
[00:27:09] Well, if SpaceX is the Uber of space, Blue Origin is now the lift. Uh, it's
[00:27:14] the Pepsi space. Look, it's it's it's going to be the new Persian Gulf over time in terms of minerals, in terms of
[00:27:21] helium, in terms of possibility of data centers and cooling and all the things. So, it is an aggressive race. It's
[00:27:28] better that we have two than one. Uh hopefully we have three or four, but um
[00:27:33] it's progress and uh and it's and it's good for the government to have multiple bids for sure. Uh and uh and it's it's
[00:27:41] uh it's improving the technology and some of these uh simple technologies that that can be used are fantastic.
[00:27:47] Two men with their and they're not am thrilled to be doing this with you, Dan. Three hours a day.
[00:27:54] Get excited. Was that a dad joke? I I love dad jokes. I love Tom Hayes. He's a dad. Thanks for being here for
[00:28:00] the hour, man. Thank you for having me. I appreciate that. Coming up, Making America. And we're back.
[00:28:06] And then uh not every one of you could get on a plane and come see me in Sarasota. Obviously, there's huge
[00:28:12] benefits to doing that and things that you can uh benefit from, but I want to get you the information
[00:28:18] uh that we were able to give out this first segment. The producer uh first
[00:28:24] off, I want to thank uh Kim Gitler. I want to thank Mike Larson, Debbie Olsen,
[00:28:29] the whole Charlotte, uh, the whole crew down there. They're always so welcoming and helpful and grateful to speak at
[00:28:35] their event. They get a tremendous amount of people down there. This was probably the biggest one that I've seen.
[00:28:41] Um, and I know they do uh even bigger, but there's like a thousand people at this keynote and then the breakout room
[00:28:47] was probably a hundred, which is just uh phenomenal. Got to see many of my
[00:28:52] existing clients. got to see uh new people coming on board this quarter uh with some of the smaller accounts the
[00:28:58] the million plus and uh excited for that. So this first segment Mike called
[00:29:04] me on Friday before the event and he goes hey I noticed you got 33 slides and you got a 15minute segment. Uh do you
[00:29:11] want to cut any of the slides? I was like I was like packing getting ready to go on the plane. I was like no Mike
[00:29:16] that's that's by design. I'll just talk fast. So, if this segment is a little rushed, um, that's okay. You can hit the
[00:29:24] pause button because there's a tremendous amount of great information. I had so many people come up to me and Mike afterwards and, uh, uh, just happy
[00:29:32] to hear actionable stuff. All of this, as you know, is opinion, not advice. Go to hedge fund tips, click on terms.
[00:29:38] While you're there, get a hat and tell your friends and family. Uh, so we'll listen into this first segment in super
[00:29:45] fast speed. Maybe you can hit slower speed to listen to it. Here we go. Value investing. Please welcome to the
[00:29:51] stage. All right.
[00:29:57] Good morning everyone. Good morning. So, did everyone grab their coffee?
[00:30:03] We have one hour worth of information to cover in 15 minutes. Are you ready? All right, let's rock and roll. So, uh,
[00:30:11] we're going to talk about once in 25 year opportunities here. Uh, as Mike was
[00:30:16] saying, Great Hill Capital is our firm. We manage money for accredited investors, family offices, and small
[00:30:23] institutions. Prior to that, I was with Cornwall Capital, if you remember the Big Short. Uh, who saw that movie? I
[00:30:30] worked for the guy played by Brad Pitt. Uh, and before that, I was with Bedford Oak Adviserss. Uh, the principal was
[00:30:37] friends with Warren Buffett for 40 years. So, as Mike said, I'm steeped in the value culture for sure. Uh we profit
[00:30:44] from buying on weakness and selling on strength. I know that's unpopular these days. People want to buy strength and
[00:30:50] sell more strength. Uh but our strategy is driven by deep research and the
[00:30:57] belief that the greater price dislocation reduces risk. Most people
[00:31:02] think when the price goes down, risk goes up. When you're buying a good
[00:31:08] business, when the price goes down, risk actually goes down. Okay. Okay, who
[00:31:13] agrees with that? Who disagrees? Okay, well maybe I can convert you over the
[00:31:18] next 14 minutes. Uh, so that's where we see opportunity. Our firm's philosophy
[00:31:23] is great investment opportunities come around when excellent companies are surrounded by unusual circumstances that
[00:31:30] cause the stock price to be misappraised. We're going to give you three of those ideas. So hang tight with
[00:31:36] us. Um, the podcast is Hedge Fund Tips with Tom Hayes. It is number one in the
[00:31:41] hedge fund category. It's been going on for six years. How many of my followers are here? We got a handful. All right.
[00:31:49] Super excited. I know a bunch of you said you were coming. So, uh, we look
[00:31:55] for one foot bars we can step over, not seven foot bars we have to jump. As you
[00:32:00] can tell, I've adopted a lot lot of Warren Buffett's philosophy. So in companies where the stock price is down
[00:32:07] a lot there are four key components. First of all we have to do solveny risk.
[00:32:13] If a stock has fallen 50 60 70% the market thinks they're in trouble. So
[00:32:19] first we look at balance sheet and cash flow and debt servicing. When we get comfortable with that we look at
[00:32:26] management. Is there a catalyst? Is there a change that's going to turn around the company's fortunes or in some
[00:32:31] case just just the company price? Because if you look under the surface, often times the free cash flow is just
[00:32:38] fine. What's the near-term catalyst? We don't want to be stuck in a value trap.
[00:32:44] We want to be in a company that can turn around quickly. And what is the
[00:32:49] competitive advantage of the company? Has the moat been permanently breached
[00:32:54] or is it temporarily impaired? These are some key things that differentiate great
[00:33:00] value investors from value investors. And it's a whole different world. So
[00:33:07] what's our edge? Every trade has a buyer and seller and both think they're right.
[00:33:13] Okay. So first and foremost is we play the time arbitrage game. Our average
[00:33:19] holding period is three to five years per position. So, we sit through the noise and people always joke Tom Hayes
[00:33:27] has ice in his veins because the short-term noise doesn't affect us. Why?
[00:33:33] Because we have underwritten the entire business as if we're buying the entire company, not just buying a ticker that's
[00:33:41] moving on a screen. Does that make sense? Okay, let's move forward.
[00:33:47] Next, we're recency bias dominates today's market. Yet, history shows that
[00:33:53] leadership is cyclical and trees don't grow to the sky. We look forward, not backward, positioning into rotations
[00:34:01] grounded in research and long-term market patterns. So, what's recency bias right now? The ZERP, zero interest rate
[00:34:09] policy error, was dominated by technology stocks and the MAG 7. Since
[00:34:14] the launch of Chat GPT, they've grown earnings six times faster than the
[00:34:19] general market than the unmagnificent 493. Uh, and outperformed the S&P by 4.5
[00:34:26] times. Who's owned some Mag Seven and done okay? Okay. Uh, all right. Pay attention. I
[00:34:33] got some news for you. So, while AI related names have accounted for over 80% of the total uh earnings growth for
[00:34:40] the index, so they've done better because they've earned more. Does that make sense? Price always follows earnings. So,
[00:34:47] here's what's changing, ladies and gentlemen. This stretch of outperformance has pushed US equities to
[00:34:54] the most concentrated levels in modern history with the top 10 stocks now making up over 40% of the index. Breath
[00:35:01] has collapsed for three straight years, matching 1998 for the narrowest leadership in decades and running well
[00:35:07] below the 48% historical median of outperformers. So what does this mean in
[00:35:13] English? It means that when the top 10 concentration in the indices reaches
[00:35:20] above 23%, history overwhelmingly favors the rest
[00:35:26] of the index, the unmagnificent 493, with the bottom 490 outperforming 88% of
[00:35:34] the time. Meanwhile, the MAG7 earnings engine is decelerating and set to converge with the other 493 by Q3 of
[00:35:42] this year, 2026, uh, positioning leadership to broaden. So, this dark
[00:35:48] blue line that's going down, that's Magnificent 7 earnings. The, um, the
[00:35:55] light blue, the aqua going up, that's the other 493 earnings. One group the earnings are going down, earnings growth
[00:36:02] is going down, the multiple is still high. The other group earnings growth is going up and the multiple is still low.
[00:36:09] What do you want to buy? The former or the latter? The coffee machine. No. Okay. All right.
[00:36:17] The ladder. Not only are MAG7 earnings slowing, but
[00:36:23] capex capital expenditures has jumped from 4% to 15% of revenue with
[00:36:29] aggressive balance sheet growers historically outperforming uh underperforming by 8.4% annually. So
[00:36:35] historically, the ones that are increasing capex massively underperform by 8 8.4%.
[00:36:42] with 60% of operating cash flow going to capex and free cash flow of the Mag 7
[00:36:49] set to drop by 43% by Q1 of 2026. That's in just a year's
[00:36:55] time. The free cash flow of the Mag 7 has dropped by 43% and multiples are
[00:37:00] still expansion because of all the capex. We prefer the AI beneficiaries
[00:37:07] versus over the hyperscalers that are footing the bill. So the ones that can benefit from the technology versus the
[00:37:13] one that are picking up the tab. Does that make sense? Okay.
[00:37:18] So we see opportunities in healthcare, energy, and small caps for 2026. Healthcare is priced at panic levels
[00:37:25] with valuation curing many ills, pun intended. Energy offers a backdoor play on AI and
[00:37:32] the data center buildout is at a fraction of the price. Uh and small caps are entering an earnings up cycle with
[00:37:39] the Fed's wind at their backs. Small caps do very well in easing cycles.
[00:37:48] Policy and regulatory uncertainty has driven a mass exodus from the healthcare se uh sector with 17 billion dollars of
[00:37:55] year-to-ate outflows in healthcare, an annualized record, and fund managers
[00:38:01] cutting exposure to multi-year lows. This sector is now on track for a third
[00:38:06] straight year of underperformance with a cumulative 54 point lag, the worst stretch on record. Are you excited about
[00:38:14] healthcare? Okay, I'm going to explain why you might want to rethink that.
[00:38:20] Healthcare uh with investors shooting first and asking questions later, many high uh quality healthcare names have
[00:38:27] ended up on the clearance rack. We think these record low valuations cure a lot of ills and offer a rare chance to buy
[00:38:34] durable businesses with demand that isn't going anywhere. Look at the health care waiting of the S&P 500. You can see
[00:38:40] it's the lowest since 2000. Remember the last time tech was that concentrated?
[00:38:46] Healthcare was at the lowest weight in the S&P. The next 5 years it dramatically outperformed.
[00:38:54] Okay, you get everyone see that chart on the left? Okay, that's an important one. First pick, Baxter International.
[00:39:03] We began building a position in Baxter after an illtimed uh acquisition and GLP1 fears gave the stock a 60% haircut
[00:39:12] uh created an attractive entry. We have leaned in further on weaknesses. This remains a classic health self-help story
[00:39:19] facing temporary headwinds yet priced as if it's on life support. Okay, looking
[00:39:25] at this chart, how many of you get excited? zero. How many of you should get
[00:39:31] excited? We'll talk. I'll I'll let you guys make your own decisions by the end of the presentation here. Okay. Founded
[00:39:39] in 1931. That's almost a hundred years, ladies and gentlemen. They've been through a
[00:39:45] few cycles. They started during the depression. I think they're going to be okay. Uh Baxter is a global leader in IV
[00:39:50] fluids, inhaled anesthetics, and everyday hospital essentials from infusion pumps to hospital beds.
[00:39:56] Opportunities to buy this serial compounder from the clearance rack are rare with only four 50% plus drawd downs
[00:40:05] on record since 1931. Uh and each down cycle going on to deliver multi-bagger returns. So if you
[00:40:13] bought this bad boy when it was down, you made boku bucks. Is everyone interested in that? Okay. So Baxter bit
[00:40:20] off more than it can chew with the 12.5 billion HillROM deal. That was a dumb
[00:40:25] deal. Okay. Since then, devestatures of BioParma at 4.25 billion, kidney at 3.8
[00:40:32] billion have taken solveny risk off the table. Remember, one of the four components, putting leverage on track
[00:40:38] for under three times by 2026. Two temporary headwinds still weigh on
[00:40:44] the stock, though both are fixable, and the market has simply lost patience. We
[00:40:49] love benefiting from others impatience. Okay. The stock market is a device for
[00:40:55] transferring wealth from the impatient investor to the patient investor. If you
[00:41:01] learn nothing else from me today, take that one home with you and think about it on the plane.
[00:41:08] Now, we see CEO Andrew Hitter as the next major catalyst for Baxter. most
[00:41:13] recently led ATS and automated solutions leader where he delivered a five bagger
[00:41:19] meaning you put in a million bucks you made 5 million bucks in six years. Before that he spent a decade at Danaher
[00:41:25] mastering the Danaher way which is a culture of executional discipline and
[00:41:31] continuous improvement that Baxter has been long overdue for as evidenced in
[00:41:37] their stock price. Right. Okay. Next. As Baxter proves it can
[00:41:42] return to four to 5% topline growth and near tame head near-term headwinds resolved, we see operating margins
[00:41:49] moving back to the high teens on a normalized earnings power of at least $3.50 per share and a return toward
[00:41:56] historical valuation levels. We think the stock can work back towards $60 over the next few years. This is an $18
[00:42:04] stock, ladies and gentlemen. This is all opinion, not advice, but this is how we underwrite businesses internally and
[00:42:09] we're sharing that information with you. Is it valuable? Yes. Okay.
[00:42:16] Moving along. Energy hated at historical extremes.
[00:42:21] Sentiment around energy has collapsed and left to left for dead levels with fund managers nearly two standard
[00:42:27] deviations under weight and the sector at just 2.6% waiting in the S&P 500. Oil
[00:42:34] short interest is at an all-time highs and the oil to S&P ratio is back at 1999
[00:42:41] levels. Generational buy opportunity conditions that set up a 10-year stretch
[00:42:46] of outperformance. Who wants to be in a sector that's due for a 10-year stretch
[00:42:51] of outperformance? Anyone? Okay, I know some of you are here for
[00:42:56] 10-minute stretches of outperformance. Uh, wrong seminar room. Okay. Uh, okay.
[00:43:02] Data center demand is expected to rise from 5% to 12% of the US electricity use
[00:43:07] by 2030, lifting total load to 31% over the next 15 years. The unprecedented
[00:43:14] demand is set to create a 20% shortfall by 2028, leading our view that natural
[00:43:21] gas is a secular, underappreciated theme with massive runway ahead. If you like
[00:43:27] AI, you're going to love natural gas. We built our com stock re resource
[00:43:33] position late 2023 when over supply, weak demand, and LG delays pushed
[00:43:38] natural gas to multi-deade lows and left the stock for dead at 8 or $9. While shares have started to recover, we
[00:43:45] continue to see this as best-in-class operator as materially undervalued and in the early innings of a secular-driven
[00:43:53] GRA gas super cycle. Comtock is the leading pureplay Hannesville gas
[00:43:59] producer with prime access to the Gulf Coast LG corer and a backdoor way to
[00:44:04] play rising AI and power demand in data center alley with LG export capacity set
[00:44:10] to double an acreage 100 miles from Dallas and Houston. Comtock has one of
[00:44:15] the most advantaged gas footprints in North America.
[00:44:21] I'm co-investors with Jerry Jones because he owns 71% of the stock. He invested $1.2 billion of his own money
[00:44:30] and he has said that his holdings in Comtock are worth far more than his Dallas Cowboys which are now worth 13
[00:44:37] billion. If he's halfright, we're going to make a ton more money on this position in our view.
[00:44:45] Comtock is also the lowest cost producer in the industry which gives a tremendous
[00:44:52] opportunity. In down markets they gain share in up markets they mint money. So
[00:44:58] you don't have to be you know fixated at the price of natural gas to own this
[00:45:03] stock. Um so we think this can work its way up to 45 to 50 over the next few years. I
[00:45:10] actually think a little bit more. My analyst is being conservative here. Uh but uh that's okay. Uh and finally is
[00:45:18] small caps. You staying with me? We got just a few more minutes left. Uh small caps underperformance uh after a decade
[00:45:26] pushed small caps to a dislocation seen only in the nifty50 and dotcom errors
[00:45:32] each followed by years of small cap outperformance. Small caps have led by 2.85%
[00:45:38] annually per year since 1927. It doesn't feel that way the last 10 years, does
[00:45:43] it? The next 10 years is going to be different and there's going to be a big catch up. And at today's 7 times
[00:45:50] relative PE ratio, history points to at least 5% annual outperformance for small
[00:45:57] caps over large caps in the next 5 years. Who's interested in that? Yeah.
[00:46:03] Okay. So, we've got a name for you here. And this name
[00:46:11] PS. I I just want to add one thing here. A dovish Fed adds another tailwind with small caps outperforming in every
[00:46:18] postcut window since 1990, delivering 11.2% 12-month returns versus 3.3%
[00:46:27] for large cap. So, in the next 12 months, this is more pronounced than even it is over the next 5 years
[00:46:33] compounded. Cooper Standard, who's heard of this company? Okay, just uh followers because
[00:46:39] they bought it at $5. So, it's at 30, it's going a lot higher. Um this we
[00:46:45] began building a position in the 2022 downturn. Uh they are an auto parts supplier to
[00:46:52] Ford, GM, Stellantis. They do the ceiling systems, the fluid transfer systems, etc. The stock was down from
[00:47:00] 146 down to $5 when we started building the position. May of 2022, they refinanced the debt. It's up to 30.
[00:47:07] Their earnings power hasn't even kicked in. Uh when they were at $146, the bit
[00:47:13] the peak of the last cycle, they were earning $7.29 a share. We believe with
[00:47:19] the amount of cost that they've taken out of the business in the last few years, $680 million of cost reductions,
[00:47:26] when the cycle returns, and it always does for the last 45 years. The average car on the road is 14.5 years old. We
[00:47:33] think they're going to earn $10 a share this cycle. So, the question only is what multiple do you put on it? A trough
[00:47:40] multiple of 10 times, which is a $100 stock, or a peak multiple like they had in 2017 of 20 times. uh we tend to be
[00:47:48] more conservative. The key is yes, it's up 6x and yes, we think it can be a few
[00:47:53] more multibags from here. We're very excited about comtock resources management, what they've done. They make
[00:47:59] more money per hybrid than they do to internal combustion engines. That helps
[00:48:05] the secular theme. We don't even have that in our models. That adds additional value. 80% cost per vehicle, 20% on the
[00:48:13] EVs. And this is how you reach me if you have any questions. Uh the podcast is Hedge Fund Tips with Tom Hayes on
[00:48:19] YouTube and wherever you get your podcast. Twitter is at hedge fund tips. Uh and that's my email and phone number.
[00:48:25] So with that said, I want to thank you. I think I got it done in 15 minutes
[00:48:32] and we did it. Couple question. Okay. Couple quick questions.
[00:48:38] If you want to raise your hand and ask questions on the screen.
[00:48:43] Yep. I got it right here. I'm gonna ask a question. The small cap
[00:48:50] under performance besides the Federal Reserve and lowering interest rates, what other catalysts do you think are
[00:48:56] going to be helping that part of the market as we roll into? Yeah, I think that's a great question. Number one is the earnings growth
[00:49:04] expectations are more than double that for the large cap indices. And number two, the reason that small caps tend to
[00:49:10] trade down is when interest rates go up because they tend to be more leveraged balance sheets. So it's not just that
[00:49:17] Fed cutting creates a risk on situation. It's that it creates a refinance situation which brings down debt service
[00:49:24] costs which increased earnings even more because if you're paying less interest, you have better growth and it takes
[00:49:30] solveny risk off the table for a lot of those companies. So it's going to be a really really positive thing. Any one more question?
[00:49:38] Do you think Oh yeah. Chat GPT is going to continue to go up as it's increasing and using
[00:49:45] chat GPT in terms of the amount of people using it. Well, no. And for investing in related
[00:49:53] if you're buying shares in the private uh OpenAI business, uh I can't speak to
[00:49:59] that because I'll give you a perfect example. Amazon.com in 2000. Okay. uh it
[00:50:06] made these bold promises. They were going to be a store of everything. They were going to sell everything to everybody. They actually did more than
[00:50:13] they promised. However, over the next 24 months from
[00:50:19] 2000 to 2002, Amazon stock was down 90%. Even though their revenues grew those
[00:50:26] years, their free cash flow grew those years, their earnings grew those years. And the reason was because despite the
[00:50:32] fact that they did everything they promised they would over the next decade, decade and a half, you were already paying as if it had happened in
[00:50:40] 2000. So that's what I we we try to just kind of hedge and and be careful. It doesn't mean that these things won't
[00:50:46] keep going up in price. The question is how many years of value are you already paying for today? We don't like to pay
[00:50:53] for that many years of value ahead. We like to get paid today. Uh and uh and we we operate in that conservative manner.
[00:50:59] But I I can't say like it's like asking me how high is bitco bitcoin gonna go. No idea. Wrong wrong wrong speaker. But
[00:51:06] uh the theme is I think we're mid to early innings of the gen generally the
[00:51:11] theme just as we were Amazon in 2000. The question is the price and for us we
[00:51:17] don't play in in the super high valuation areas. Yeah. Wonderful. Thank you. Thank you.
[00:51:28] And just And we're back. And then I was on a panel that was entitled keynote panel
[00:51:35] again in the main room. Uh 10 key stocks. Only Scott and I gave stocks. Uh
[00:51:41] so we cut it down to the ones you'll want to hear. We'll listen in here. Got it. Tom, I want to go to you. You've been patiently waiting here. We're
[00:51:47] talking, you know, as a value focused investor versus growth maybe versus some of the AI names. You had some sectors
[00:51:53] you were looking at earlier and some names. So what would you add to this discussion? Yeah, I think we're in a very bifurcated market. You have the
[00:51:59] concentrated stocks which uh I think you you run the larger risk. Okay, I
[00:52:05] definitely agree that we're in the roaring uh 20 2020s and the the story is just getting started, but uh outside of
[00:52:12] that, you could basically throw a dart at a board uh to Scott Martin's point and find a tremendous amount of
[00:52:18] opportunities to put money to work at reasonable valuations. And a theme at our firm at Great Hill Capital, uh we
[00:52:25] are looking to benefit from uh and and focus on and invest in the AI
[00:52:30] beneficiaries versus the AI cost centers, the companies that are going to
[00:52:37] uh increase margin as a result of implementation of the technology versus the ones that are absorbing all of the
[00:52:43] capex. Uh and I think to Scott's point, Scott uh Z's point is uh the earnings
[00:52:50] growth rate of the Mag 7 is actually aggressively decelerating and the cash flow uh generation is aggressively
[00:52:58] decelerating. So you you have a situation where you have uh expanded multiples in this tiny little area of
[00:53:04] the market uh with declining earnings growth and then you have the rest of the market that you could throw a dart at
[00:53:11] where the earnings growth is accelerating and is going to be parry pursu the growth rate with the this
[00:53:17] concentrated level but the multiple is meaningfully lower which is a point that uh Scott Z made uh so I think there's
[00:53:25] really unlimited opportunity uh one company I don't know if you want to go into companies yet that uh that is
[00:53:31] holding for us is GXO Logistics. This is a Brad Jacobs company. Does anyone know
[00:53:37] who Brad Jacobs is? Okay. Brad Jacobs has probably created more wealth for
[00:53:43] shareholders than any other operator in the business. Um he did United Rentals,
[00:53:48] the equipment leasing company. If you'd invested with him when he got involved, you made 200 times your money. So if you
[00:53:54] put in a million dollars, 18 years later, you had $200 million. If you did XBO Logistics with Brad Jacobs and you
[00:54:01] put in a million bucks, you had 50 million in about 10 years. Uh he is still the chairman of GXO Logistics,
[00:54:08] which was spun out of XPO Logistics. They just put in a new CEO. If you
[00:54:14] remember from this morning, the new jockey is critical. Uh the new CEO is Patrick Keller. He ran DHL US. Okay. and
[00:54:24] uh for 33 years he knows what he's doing. 75% of GXO's current revenues are
[00:54:31] outside the US. So it's it's a weak dollar play which is good, but there's a
[00:54:37] tremendous amount of blue sky in the United States with the free trade zones where people are shipping to get around
[00:54:43] the tariffs. They can keep them in warehouses until they actually ship to the customers. They're taking advantage
[00:54:48] of that. They've brought on a lot of new clients, Nike, Boeing, Apple, etc. Uh,
[00:54:54] trading at a very low multiple. And the stock got hammered. Uh, it was a $100 at the COVID peak when everyone was
[00:55:00] shipping everything, you know, e-commerce, logistics, uh, contract logistics,
[00:55:06] reverse logistics, etc. And then you went into the everyone was buying goods
[00:55:11] during COVID. Then you went into the Dtock cycle. Uh, that bottomed out the end of 2023. They are now uh
[00:55:19] reacelerating in terms of margins, in terms of revenues. Uh everything is hitting on all cylinders. We have the
[00:55:25] new CEO and they just got the approval in the United Kingdom for the Winkington
[00:55:30] acquisition which the CMA was holding up for a while. That's going to add another 60 million of cost synergies and their
[00:55:37] return on operating capital has been north of 30% consistently. So, uh this is a $50 stock. Uh we've built a a
[00:55:44] pretty sizable position here. Uh we think this can be a double over the next three years at least. Uh and uh and
[00:55:50] we're pretty sanguin about that. And that's one that you don't have to worry about being at nosebleleed levels. If they miss a quarter, the stock's down
[00:55:56] 50%. You're not going to find that with the GXL logistics with that leadership and with that opportunity with the
[00:56:03] reaceleration uh of the industry and the margin expansion. By the way, they use more robots in their picking in their
[00:56:09] warehouses than any other company there there is. So talk about AI and robotics
[00:56:14] and agentics and all of that. They are a leader in that and Brad Jacobs has done that throughout his career is he rolls
[00:56:21] up industries and then he implements technologies to double Ibida and he's doing the exact same thing at GXO.
[00:56:28] Well, Scott Martin since time we want to make sure you get your one or two, three, four questions in before uh we
[00:56:33] have to wrap this up. What? Oh, I'm sorry. I got I got one more. Um who was here
[00:56:38] two years ago or at the Money Show a couple years ago? Uh, okay, great. Quite a actually, no, a decent amount. Uh, I
[00:56:45] pitched a stock called Alibaba. It was quote uninvestable. It was China. Uh,
[00:56:50] it's now up triple. Uh, the options we did are up 7x. I've got a new one for you and it's going to make you want to
[00:56:58] get a, you know, one of those airplane bags exactly the way you got an airplane bag two years ago with Alibaba. It's
[00:57:05] called PayPal. Okay. Stock's down 80% from its COVID highs. Uh it's generating
[00:57:10] record- free cash flow. No one's paying attention. They generate six to7 billion. Oh, and by the way, they're
[00:57:16] buying back 10% of the company every single year. They're uh um they have
[00:57:21] record users, 438 million. They they fired all their nonprofitable customers.
[00:57:27] Alex Chris came from in it where he ran the small business unit. This was one of our catalysts this morning, a new
[00:57:33] jockey. uh it was a 38 bagger while he was running that division into it stock.
[00:57:39] So now he's applying those. They brought over the guy from Amazon who started the whole ad business on Amazon. They're
[00:57:44] doing that uh on on PayPal. Uh Venmo's now got 100 million users. It's like the
[00:57:52] Kleenex of peer-to-peer uh thing. Buy now pay later is growing at 20% and you
[00:57:57] can't give the stock away. $67 billion of free cash flow. I mean, it's just a
[00:58:02] cash machine. It's reacelerating. Margins are expanding. Revenue is expanding. No one's paying attention.
[00:58:08] This is exactly what was happening with Baba two years ago when everyone said, "China, China's uninvestable." PayPal,
[00:58:14] that's yesterday's news. I'm telling you, we'll come back in two years. This stock is going to be $60 now. It
[00:58:21] probably be 120 to 150. And people will just be starting to pay attention to it. The sell side will just be putting out
[00:58:27] their buy by buy ratings at 130 saying it's going to 150. And if you were here at the money show, you'll have a little
[00:58:33] bit. Your downside's protected. Your upsides uh uh meaningful. And um and
[00:58:39] that's one we like. This is all opinion, not advice. I'm just sharing what we ownation
[00:58:45] back when they did it. And also the fact that they too are starting to show some of this great. By the way, you brought up Brainree, which is a great point. Uh people are
[00:58:52] like, I haven't used PayPal in 5 years. Did you take did you take an Uber here by the way? Uh that's powered by
[00:58:57] Brainree, which is owned by PayPal. Okay. Did you uh book a trip lately? All
[00:59:03] the websites are powered by Brainree which is owned by PayPal. Most people don't know that. So could be an Inquisition too. Acquisition
[00:59:08] target potentially if they keep you know turning at such a cheaper level. Yeah. Yeah. So uh well I would have
[00:59:14] something to say to the board. I mean the worst thing that can ever happen with a turnaround is that the idiot board takes a 20% premium bid when the
[00:59:22] stock is going to be a triple over the next few years because they're hitting on all cylinders. I don't think Alex Chris would go for that. Um, and um, uh,
[00:59:30] actually GXO had a a takeout offer at $60 and I got all over them. If you
[00:59:36] accept this, I'm I'm I'm never Let's just say I I was not going to be accepting because I own it at 50. I
[00:59:43] didn't get into it for 20% return. This is going to be a double double plus. It's going to be a $100 stock. Why the hell would you even entertain selling it
[00:59:50] at $60? And sure enough, they rejected the offer. It's going to be a double to a triple over the next few years. Same
[00:59:56] thing with PayPal. they'd be absolutely out of their minds to accept except except uh by the way the the fifth
[01:00:02] largest issuer of stable coins 3.6 6 billion. They are hitting on all cylinders. This Alex Chris, the rewards
[01:00:08] that he's doing on the debit cards, the university branding. Every university now has a Venmo debit card with the
[01:00:15] branding of their football team. I mean, kids are getting into the habit. People have no idea what Alex Chris has done in
[01:00:22] YouTube considerably. I mean, it's the UI is a lot easier that just the interfacing the the cards is really good actually.
[01:00:27] Yeah. So, you're passionate about that one. Yeah. I want to
[01:00:33] look every year my position gets 10% bigger and I didn't put a new dollar in. I mean, you can't ask for anything more than that.
[01:00:39] Scott Martin, I wanted to ask you for Okay, and we're back. And then, uh, this
[01:00:44] was the panel room that you're all probably going to want to hear about the road map for the midterm election. Here
[01:00:50] we had 28 slides, but we got a full 45 minutes with question and answer. Uh,
[01:00:57] phenomenal job. Want to thank Jeff for putting together all these incredible slide decks and write up. He does an
[01:01:03] incredible job and he's going to be working uh nonstop uh in the next uh uh
[01:01:10] few weeks. We are going full boore here. We got a lot of exciting stuff going on and um so if you ever get a chance to
[01:01:17] meet him, thank him for all the hard work that goes on behind the scenes. Uh we're going to listen in here at a more
[01:01:22] normalized pace with questions and uh really going through each idea. Here we go.
[01:01:28] Uh, yesterday we had 33 slides to get through in 15 minutes. Uh, today we have
[01:01:34] 28 slides to get through in 45 minutes. So, we've got plenty of time to talk. We
[01:01:40] can take questions uh throughout. If you need to ask questions throughout, that's fine. But I think we'll open it up at
[01:01:46] the end for 10 or 15 minutes for questions. Um, but if anything is really nagging you as we go through this,
[01:01:52] please feel free to uh to raise your hand and and we'll get this done. if you remember that from from school days. Uh
[01:01:59] what what was it? Morehouse Muenberg. Muenberg. There you go. Uh so we're
[01:02:05] moving into an ele midterm election year. There is one gentleman in here
[01:02:12] that has a sense of what that could mean. Uh anyone else uh have an idea of
[01:02:17] what happens in midterm election years in the stock market generally?
[01:02:23] All right. Yeah, that's right. That's right. Good. You will get the free
[01:02:30] virtual prize. It's so virtual you're not even gonna be able to see it. Uh
[01:02:36] little bit about my background. Not everyone was here yesterday uh or saw saw me in the morning. Uh Great Hill
[01:02:42] Capital is my firm. We manage money for um high net worth individuals, for
[01:02:48] family offices, and for institutions. Um, prior to that, I was at a firm
[01:02:53] called Cornwall Capital Management. Uh, any of you see The Big Short, the movie?
[01:03:00] Uh, the, um, I worked for the gentleman played by Brad Pitt. His name was Ben
[01:03:07] Rickett in the movie, Ben Hockett in real life, uh, probably four times as
[01:03:12] smart as, uh, Brad Pitt, uh, and 1/4 as handsome in real life. Uh, but super
[01:03:19] guy. I still talk to him to this day. I learned a lot about derivatives uh at Cornwall. Uh they were great and s guys.
[01:03:28] Prior to that, uh I was at a firm called Bedford Oak Advisors. Uh the principal
[01:03:33] was friends with Warren Buffett for 40 some odd years. So I kind of got steeped in the value methodology early on. Uh go
[01:03:41] flying out to Omaha and Gabelli's Jet every year. They they were close friends. And that fund was seated by uh
[01:03:50] Sandy While put in 25 million, Sam Zel put in 25 million, Mike Bloomberg put in
[01:03:57] 25 uh and a guy named Phil Frost put in 25 which was the uh founder of Tea for
[01:04:04] those of you who have been around for a little while. So uh so cut my cloth there. We had a portfolio company
[01:04:12] uh that preceded me coming in that was kind of beat down small cap after the great financial crisis. He said, "Hey, I
[01:04:19] got great news for you. You're going to become COO of a public company." And I was 31 years old or something like that.
[01:04:26] I was like, "This is incredible. Uh bad news is you got a lot of work to do. You're going to clean up this shell.
[01:04:31] You're going to sell off all the non-core assets which was a hardware company uh a distribution company that
[01:04:38] supplied to all the Ace Hardware a piece of land in Pauling New York uh all these disparit assets sell that off use the
[01:04:45] and then take the 30 million or so and buy an asset management business. So for a year I spent going all around I
[01:04:54] interviewed over a hundred different asset management firms. I saw all the strategies under the sun. What worked?
[01:05:00] What didn't worked? what was durable, what was non-durable. I looked under the kimono of the industry. Uh, and I did
[01:05:06] get a deal done. We bought a firm that had 1.6 billion under management. The stock doubled immediately. Uh, and um,
[01:05:14] so that was just an incredible experience and learned quite a quite a lot about managing money. A lot of hedge
[01:05:19] fund dinners with Lee Cooperman and and that whole crew and uh, very very grateful for that opportunity.
[01:05:27] Uh, went to Colombia. That doesn't mean anything anymore. uh results results are the name of the
[01:05:34] game. So uh we're predominantly concentrated long only 8 to 12 stocks uh
[01:05:41] makes up 85 to 90% of the portfolio. 10 to 15% of the portfolio we use for
[01:05:47] derivative overlay in English uh you know that that means we'll do longdated
[01:05:53] options on core positions and we or spreads uh and we also use that bucket
[01:05:59] for hedging from time to time if we think the market is excessively overvalued but our core positions are
[01:06:06] not at fully valued and we don't want to realize profits before full maturity uh we'll use that bucket to dampen
[01:06:12] volatility uh sometimes times put spreads on the indices on individual names or sectors. So that's um that's
[01:06:19] how we do that. But I I think I referenced yesterday when we were talking about BABA, it's like yeah, the
[01:06:25] stocks up 3x off the bottom, but the options we did uh we closed out at 6 to 7x. So that adds a lot of alpha even if
[01:06:31] they're one and two% position. So that's what we like to do for clients. Um the
[01:06:37] philosophy of the firm comes straight from Warren Buffett both both in what we
[01:06:43] believe and and what we charge. Uh we don't charge a management fee which is
[01:06:48] very unusual. So, we get paid zero until the account goes up. And then when the account goes up, we get a percentage of
[01:06:54] the profits based on the size of the account. And then uh to get paid again, we have to earn back 100% of what we
[01:07:02] were paid uh which is what we call a high watermark uh before we get paid again. So, very few people do that. Uh
[01:07:09] I'd love to take credit for it, but I just copied what Warren did when he was running his partnerships.
[01:07:14] Uh and the philosophy is that great investment opportunities come around
[01:07:19] when excellent companies are surrounded by unusual circumstances that cause the
[01:07:25] stock to be misappraised. So uh how many of you were here a couple years ago when I was really pounding the table on Baba?
[01:07:33] Yeah, a few of you. So you know, excellent is uh in the eye of the
[01:07:38] beholder. You know, some people think excellent is some company's going to change the future, but they're losing a
[01:07:44] billion dollars a year. Um, we like to bet on sure things. At the time, uh,
[01:07:50] Alibaba had $80 billion of cash on its balance sheet. It was generating $25
[01:07:55] billion of free cash flow uh, and growing and you could not give the stock away because of all the noise about
[01:08:01] uninvestable, about China and all of that stuff. Um, the other thing that we do that
[01:08:08] people find pretty valuable is Hedge Fund Tips with Tom Hayes is the number
[01:08:13] one ranked uh podcast in the hedge fund category by FeedSpot. Uh, you can find
[01:08:19] that on YouTube. Uh, how many of you um have listened to one of my podcasts or more? Okay, handful of you. That's
[01:08:27] great. Um, do you listen or watch? Watch. You watch it. Did you start by listening
[01:08:33] and then you switched to watching or you always watched? Always watched. Listen or watch?
[01:08:39] Both. Yeah. Uh listening's great because you can do other things. Watching we go through a tremendous amount of data
[01:08:44] every single week, market data, so you'll absorb it a little bit better. I'm I'm more of a visual learner, so you can find it on YouTube. Uh it's
[01:08:51] definitely if you had an idea of the people who listen to that this both in
[01:08:56] the industry and out of the industry, it would it would blow your mind. Uh I'm humbled by that. And uh 6 years later,
[01:09:02] that's the kind of stuff that happens when you get the snowball going. Uh we
[01:09:08] profit by buying on weakness and selling on strength. That's kind of unpopular nowadays. Uh buy low, sell high.
[01:09:15] Everyone knows that's the way to do it. It's like losing weight, eat less, exercise more. We all know it. None of us do it. Uh uh but it's driven by deep
[01:09:23] research and the belief that the greater price dislocation reduces the risk. And
[01:09:28] where others see volatility as danger, we see it as opportunity. Um and and the key thing here is it's
[01:09:36] not just a stock that goes down in price. It's a stock that goes down in price
[01:09:41] relative to value. So how do we define value? We we tend to define value uh by
[01:09:48] the amount of cash the business generates either at present or on a
[01:09:53] normalized basis. We tend to be in pretty boring, durable businesses that have been around for a very long time.
[01:09:59] So, if they're having a temporary impairment of cash flow, we we use our
[01:10:06] our expertise to determine is this a temporary impairment and down um not for
[01:10:12] a good reason or is it a permanent impairment and it deserves to be down and it's never coming back. And that's kind of the key distinction. It's not
[01:10:19] just buying stocks that are down. It's buying stock great businesses that are down for specific reasons. Um,
[01:10:27] you know, people ask me, do you do private deals? Do you invest in private companies? And I say, I never really do
[01:10:33] private deals because the prices that the public markets quote from time to
[01:10:39] time for some of the best businesses in the world are deals that would never be entertained in the private markets. You
[01:10:46] know, one of the filters that we use uh when we go into a business, the first filter is if JP Morgan was going to
[01:10:53] finance me to buy this entire company, they were going to give me debt financing with one catch. The catch is I
[01:11:00] had to be 100% of the equity with 100% of my net worth. So, if I'm right,
[01:11:07] because the equity slug is so small, I'll make 20x if the stock doubles. If I'm wrong, I'll be applying for a job as
[01:11:15] a Walmart greeter because I'll be completely wiped out. And if if I wouldn't do that deal, we will not buy
[01:11:24] one share of stock. So sometimes people think in investing business act you get
[01:11:30] paid for activity because in the real world you know many of the people that come to me are exceptionally successful
[01:11:36] people 100 200 500 some 3 4 5 billion and they became wealthy
[01:11:43] through massive action right in the real world massive action equals massive results
[01:11:49] in the investing world it's the exact opposite massive inaction leads to massive
[01:11:57] results once you've underwritten the company properly and you've done your research and you're getting it at an
[01:12:02] exceptional value. Um the opportunities in the public markets are can't be
[01:12:08] matched. The second filter that we go to with a business is if we were to go to
[01:12:16] the board of directors and offer to buy the entire company
[01:12:21] today at the price it was quoted in the public markets,
[01:12:28] would they call security to have me escorted out of the building because they think I was crazy? And if the
[01:12:34] answer is no, they would entertain the offer. We wouldn't do the deal. If the
[01:12:39] answer is yes, why would they ever consider selling at the ridiculous price it's quoted in the market? Then it's
[01:12:45] something that we want to do. And the thing about public markets that creates these opportunities is what most people
[01:12:52] don't understand is there are structural mechanisms that force great companies to
[01:12:57] price at absurd levels from time to time. And that's the active manager syndrome. They need at the end of the
[01:13:04] quarter to show that they were in those stocks that went up the most. And frequently those are the ones that are
[01:13:10] fully valued or nearing full value. When they have a stock that's down 20% that quarter, they tend to sell it down and
[01:13:18] that creates additional pressure, selling pressure on the stock, that creates these aberrationally low prices
[01:13:23] because the institutions are structurally forced to get it off their books. At the end of the year, they don't want to show five stocks on their
[01:13:30] books that had the worst performance in the S&P 500. and yet they should be
[01:13:35] buying those potentially in December for the next year, but they don't want to put those on the their book. So that
[01:13:40] creates a unique opportunity for us to take advantage of from time to time.
[01:13:47] Midterm years are the choppiest. So if you thought next year was going to
[01:13:54] be as easy as the last three years by buying an index fund and going to the beach, uh you might be mistaken. if
[01:14:02] history has any bearing on the future. This chart on the left is the S&P
[01:14:08] seasonal composite 4-year election cycle. And you can kind of see we're a
[01:14:14] little bit past where this red line is. Um, you know, and we've seen this kind of choppiness after the 50% plus run off
[01:14:22] the bottom in April. We've seen this choppiness. And what's interesting, this is a composite going back 98 years, and
[01:14:28] it looks exactly like what we've seen in this particular presidential cycle, which implies kind of a sideways
[01:14:35] consolidation move after a big move. Um, with the weakness culminating around
[01:14:41] September of 2026. Um, and you can see here the Aqua is the
[01:14:49] past 10 cycles since 1985. The average returns for the S&P are 2.2
[01:14:57] and percent. And if you go back since 1950, the average returns are 4.6%.
[01:15:05] That's from U. Ryan Dietrich over at Carson, by the way. So, as we move into
[01:15:11] a midterm year, political noise tends to creep into the markets, making these years the weakest of the four-year
[01:15:17] cycle. Since 1950, they've averaged 4.6% 6% versus 11% in other years, by the
[01:15:23] way. That's meaningful underperformance. And the past 10 cycles have been weaker at just 2.2% with stocks usually
[01:15:30] remaining under pressure until late September. Midterm volatility pays off.
[01:15:39] Uh midterm years tend to see the largest intrayear
[01:15:45] pullback and it averages 17.5%.
[01:15:52] Is anyone looking forward to a 17.5% pullback next year? No. Uh I am actually
[01:16:00] more sanguin than most uh next year. And the reason is uh you tend to get a you
[01:16:06] don't you don't 10 the average is you get a 20% correction every 3.5 years.
[01:16:13] We have had three 20% corrections in the last 5 years. So it effectively if if
[01:16:21] the long-term average means anything we've pulled forward 10 years of 20% corrections in the last five years.
[01:16:28] That's why I think uh next year might be more modest in terms of volatility than than history would suggest. But I think
[01:16:35] it would be natural to get a 10% pullback because you get one of those every 13 months on average and it always
[01:16:44] feels like the world is ending. Uh midterm years are volatile, tend to deliver the largest draw downs, uh
[01:16:51] averaging 17.5 compared with other years which average 12.3%
[01:16:57] in the other three years. Yet those sell-offs have consistently been buying opportunities with stocks never lower
[01:17:03] one year after the midterm low and up 31.7% on average going back to 1950.
[01:17:11] So, if you have some dry powder next September and we're down 10 15% in the
[01:17:17] general indices and you weren't in defensives that are up a lot, we're going to get to that in a second. Uh
[01:17:23] that that is generally a very good time to put money to work. And guess what?
[01:17:29] If the market's down in September and the Republicans sweep, would it be a
[01:17:35] good time to put money to work?
[01:17:41] Yes. No. No. Okay, I'm gonna say yes.
[01:17:47] If we're down 10 or 15% in September and the Democrats sweep, would that be a good time to put money to work?
[01:17:56] Yes, it doesn't matter. Hate to break it to you, but I can tell
[01:18:01] we have more Democrats than Republicans in this room. Um, which is a-okay uh by
[01:18:07] me. Uh surprising, but that's the numbers. Uh and we're filling up pretty quick.
[01:18:13] Thanks for thanks for coming in, ladies and gentlemen. Uh okay, midterms favor defensive. So, there's a way around this
[01:18:20] perceived and possible index pain that we're going to see. If the S&P 500 is
[01:18:27] down 10% or more at some point during the year, what stocks would you guess
[01:18:32] are getting hit worse than 10% for that to be the case?
[01:18:38] What? Big tech. Yeah, that's exactly right. Probably big tech because they have the biggest weight in the index.
[01:18:46] Um, so midterms favor defensive stocks. Defensive stocks in this case we're
[01:18:52] going to talk about is healthcare. Durable demand at a discount.
[01:18:59] And my friend Sam was saying, well, what about utilities? Utilities, the game has changed because that used to be
[01:19:05] defensives. Now, it's kind of an AI trade, so it's gotten all confused. So, we're just going to leave those out for
[01:19:10] right now because we can't find any bargains anyway. Uh, consumer staples, boring works when volatility rises. And
[01:19:18] dividend payers, cash on the sidelines is coming home. Uh, the other thing that
[01:19:24] helps with dividend payers is the beginning of an easing cycle. as rates
[01:19:29] go down and people can't collect four four and a half percent with their eyes closed, they will be forced out on the
[01:19:35] risk curve to get that yield. And that will be found in uh dividend payers,
[01:19:40] three of which we're going to cover today. Uh with volatility likely elevated and
[01:19:46] markets grinding sideways, we see opportunity in the neglected defensive areas of the market. Healthcare and
[01:19:51] consumer staples have consistently been top performers in midterm election years and falling rates should pull sideline
[01:19:58] cash towards these sectors and towards dividend stocks.
[01:20:04] So here's another visual. defensive sectors
[01:20:10] market cap weight uh relative to uh in the S&P 500 has
[01:20:16] fallen to lows not seen in over 25 years
[01:20:22] since 2000. And if you remember 2000 was a very concentrated techdriven market.
[01:20:28] Defensive have had a very low waiting. You saw what happened next. defensives waiting went up dramatically as demand
[01:20:34] for them increased materially and the Fed began easing. So def defensive
[01:20:40] sectors sit at their lowest S&P weight on record and trade at the valuation discounts last seen in the early 2000s
[01:20:47] which preceded a multi-year stretch of outperformance. We expect defensives to catch a bid as volatility rises, having
[01:20:54] outperformed cyclicals by 7% in seven of the past eight midterm cycles leading
[01:21:02] into the elections. So 7% outperformance by defensives in a
[01:21:10] midterm election year. Is that meaningful? So if you follow the crowd, you're
[01:21:16] likely to have, if history is any forecaster, underperformance and probably some pain.
[01:21:24] If you go against the crowd right now, you can't give away defensive stocks and you can't give away staples. Uh you have
[01:21:30] a chance to do exceptionally well next year. And buying really businesses that are so durable and have been around for
[01:21:36] so long and you can sleep like a baby at night. You don't have to predict who's going to cure cancer. You don't have to predict who's going to win the AI race.
[01:21:42] You don't have to have a crystal ball. All you have to know is people are going to brush their teeth. They're going to drink alcohol. They're going to uh um
[01:21:50] what else they do? They're going to bathe themselves. They're going to shave. They're going to uh take their
[01:21:55] pharmaceuticals. They're going to go to the doctor. All these things that are easy, predictable
[01:22:01] uh and defensible. Health care.
[01:22:08] Uh what we see here in the left chart, healthc care versus S&P 500 returns by
[01:22:13] presidential cycle. You can see healthcare outperforms since 1973 by
[01:22:20] just about 9%. So that's even more than the overall basket of defensives in a midterm
[01:22:26] election year. And you can also see this visual chart
[01:22:35] uh which I'll just point out. This is kind of you are here like when you're at the mall. Okay. Uh that's the that's the
[01:22:43] kind of the map. So if there's ever a year to own health care relative to the
[01:22:48] other four years in the presidential cycle, the second year of the cycle is it.
[01:22:53] Healthcare has beaten the S&P 500 in 11 of the last 13 midterm years, delivering
[01:23:00] 9.03% 03% returns on average versus 62 basis points for the S&P 500 with record
[01:23:06] outflows, its worst three-year relative stretch on on record. Multi-year low
[01:23:11] exposure and valuations at historic discounts, healthc care stands out as one of the most attractive sectors for
[01:23:18] 2026.
[01:23:26] Volatility also sets up consumer staples. Um you can see in the Bank of America
[01:23:33] fund manager survey they have their lowest exposure to Staples before the
[01:23:38] great financial crisis and that quickly changed once volatility picked up.
[01:23:44] Sentiment around Staples is washed out with exposure sitting about one standard deviation below its historical average
[01:23:50] and the group's relative ratio to the S&P 500 at a record low with only 5% of
[01:23:55] staples outperforming over the past 6 months. one of the weakest readings in 50 years. We think rising volatility
[01:24:03] sets the stage for a rotation. So most people say, "Well, healthcare is not performing anymore. I don't I want
[01:24:10] to avoid that." We see that and we say healthcare is not going away if there
[01:24:15] was ever a time to buy it. You know, I always joke Wall Street is the only place in the only market in the world
[01:24:21] when they throw a clearance sale, everyone runs out of the store. I mean, you can't make this stuff up. Black
[01:24:26] Friday, they're waiting outside tackling each other for a clearance sale on a big screen TV. Wall Street, you get a
[01:24:32] clearance sale, they run out of they run out of the building. So, uh, I suggest you run in.
[01:24:39] Dividend yield is back in play. High dividend yield still cheap and
[01:24:44] underowned. You can see going back to 2001, one of the best opportunities in
[01:24:50] 25 years. So, when we're talking about generational buy opportunities, we're not trying to be hyperbolic. We're just
[01:24:56] dealing with the facts. Dividend payers remain neglected with the S&P 500's
[01:25:01] dividend yield down to 1.17%, its lowest level since 2000. While
[01:25:07] nearly 7.5 trillion sits in money market funds earning 4% risk-free. As rates
[01:25:12] move lower and investors get pushed out of cash, the search for yield should put dividend and other defensive stocks back
[01:25:20] in favor. Okay. Defensive pick number one,
[01:25:28] Fizer. Here's a stock you haven't heard of in a while. People are very, very uh, by the
[01:25:34] way, I had them turn up the lights before this because I knew the Fiser name was going to put you to sleep. Uh,
[01:25:40] and that's where we like to traffic in in the places that no one's paying attention to at the particular time we
[01:25:45] build our position. Um, is this the first time you're
[01:25:51] hearing about it? Yeah. Yeah. Very recently.
[01:25:57] Yeah. Very very recently. Um
[01:26:02] it's a m Yeah. So uh we built our position in this iconic American blue chip as forced selling and uh Fiser
[01:26:10] specific headaches pushed the stock to life support valuations. Uh you can see it uh recently had a big flush out and
[01:26:19] then uh had another flush out and we we've been able to um really build a
[01:26:25] nice size position with a long-term view. Um down to down more than 60%
[01:26:34] from its 2021 highs. The market remains fixated on the COVID hangover and patent
[01:26:39] fears, missing the rebuild in the pipeline, the deals and the margins that we expect to drive meaningful upside.
[01:26:52] Force selling earlier in the presentation. No, just didn't you just say one reason for
[01:26:57] selling is when active managers are forced to sell because the stock performance is down and it's kind of a perpetual. It's the same thing when a
[01:27:03] stock goes up, it's almost forced buyers or or what you saw from April through um
[01:27:09] basically September, you had forced buyers. People who missed the first 30% move were forced back into the market
[01:27:15] because they had sold the bottom if you look at data and then they had to buy the top in September, October, etc.
[01:27:22] Good question. Uh Fizer founded in 1849.
[01:27:28] So, they've been through a couple midterm election year cycles in their day. They've been through a couple
[01:27:35] depressions, a couple great financial crisises. This is a durable company, is one of the world's largest
[01:27:41] pharmaceutical companies with a broad portfolio across vaccines, oncology, and
[01:27:46] immunology. The company markets nine blockbuster products led by Eloquist and
[01:27:51] Prevnar and famously delivered the top selling COVID vaccine and leading treatment paxid during the pandemic.
[01:28:01] 45 billion in revenues in 2025. 200 countries 101 projects in the
[01:28:07] pipeline. Nine products with sales greater than a billion in 2025.
[01:28:15] uh CEO Albert Borla. I could take him or leave him to be honest with you, but you
[01:28:20] know, Warren Buffett taught me or taught us all buy a business that's so great
[01:28:25] even a ham sandwich could run it because one day a ham sandwich will run it. Uh I'm not saying whether that's Borla or
[01:28:31] not, but uh I I wouldn't lose sleep if they replaced him and uh and I think it'll do well in spite of them. So,
[01:28:38] let's just leave it at that. Uh FISA reaped a massive financial windfall from its COVID franchise, generating $90
[01:28:45] billion in supplemental revenue and $40 billion in incremental free cash flow from 2021 to 2022, pushing earnings to a
[01:28:53] record $6.58 per share. When COVID demand evaporated in 2023,
[01:28:59] revenue fell by 40% and the company absorbed large inventory and intangible write downs, sending adjusted EPS down
[01:29:06] 72% to a buck 84 with COVID volatility and uncertainty now largely behind
[01:29:12] Fizer. The top line has stabilized above 62 billion essentially back to prepandemic levels. Plus, acquisitions
[01:29:19] and earnings have recovered toward the $3.13 expected per year. For those of you who
[01:29:24] are good with math, $25 stock is trading at about eight times forward earnings.
[01:29:30] Not 80, not 80, not 200 times sales, ladies and gentlemen, eight times
[01:29:36] earnings. Uh Fizer dominated the COVID era
[01:29:44] with CO franchise pushing revenue above 100 billion accounting for 57% of sales in 2022. Today, CO represents less than
[01:29:51] 14% of revenue and the volatility has largely passed, leaving behind a stabilized business and the windfall
[01:29:58] fund to fund the company's next phase of growth and blockbuster products.
[01:30:08] Fizer faces a late decade pack patent cliff with key blockbusters like IBR,
[01:30:14] Eloquis, uh, Xandandy, and Prevnar losing exclusivity between 2026 and
[01:30:19] 2028, putting 17 to 18 billion of annual revenue at risk. So, the stock's down.
[01:30:25] There's some reasons behind that. Uh, to offset this pressure, management has launched a cost savings plan targeting
[01:30:32] 7.2 2 billion in net savings in 2027 while reinvesting $500 million to strengthen R&D productivity.
[01:30:40] Management is on track to deliver 4.5 billion of savings by year end supporting the goal of restoring Fizer's
[01:30:46] operating margins to their preandemic high 20% range. Margin expansion is the
[01:30:53] name of the game for rerating a stock. Rerating just means multiple expansion
[01:30:59] re reaceleration. Fiser enters the patent cycles from a stronger base than peers with no product
[01:31:06] above 12% of sales. The market is overly pessimistic and missing the 7.2 billion
[01:31:11] right sizing effort and the pipeline and deals aimed at countering the patent pressure. Together, these offsets give
[01:31:17] Fizer a clear and credible path to navigate the cycle and restore margins.
[01:31:26] Yeah. the president $30 million a year.
[01:31:32] Yeah. Well, his stock goes down. Um, you know,
[01:31:39] that that is something we do keep an eye on. It's um compensation to management.
[01:31:45] Uh, it's in line. Does he deserve that much money? It's a pretty big company, so it's kind of a rounding error. But,
[01:31:51] uh, to your point, maybe this guy doesn't, maybe the next guy does. We'll see.
[01:31:57] Uh after Fizer's homegrown obesity programs flopped and the company appeared out of the race, the 10 billion
[01:32:03] Metera acquisition provides the missing piece, a differentiated once monthly GLP1 platform in a rapidly growing
[01:32:09] hundred billion dollar market. Early data is promising with products potentially hitting the market by 2028
[01:32:15] and delivering 5 billion plus in peak annual sales once a month versus, you know, more regular and also oral
[01:32:23] optionality as well. If you could get an oral pill, you know, it changed the world. Uh the four $43 billion CGEN deal
[01:32:30] added four approved cancer drugs and a leading ADC pipeline that Fiser believes can grow from 2 billion in annual sales
[01:32:38] at purchase to more than 10 billion by 2030, strengthening the oncology growth engine as legacy drugs approach
[01:32:44] expiration. Fiser's pipeline and recent deals are materially underappreciated with Metser's once monthly GLP1 platform
[01:32:52] and the 43 billion CGEN deal driving the next leg of growth together with Arena Biohaven GBT and others. These assets
[01:32:59] should add $25 billion in 2030 revenue, offset expirations, and set up a path
[01:33:06] toward greater than $80 billion in non-COVID sales by 2030.
[01:33:14] valuation yields set the floor. Fiser trades at just eight times forward earnings, a steep discount to the mid-
[01:33:19] teens industry average, making it one of the cheapest large cap farmer names to own. The stock offers a it's about a 7%
[01:33:27] dividend yield right now, more than four times the sector average. Its 86-year-old dividend record and 16
[01:33:34] consecutive years of increases are supported by 15 billion in cash and $13
[01:33:39] billion in annual free cash flow. Okay. Is this a stock where you have to lay up
[01:33:45] at night staring at the ceiling wondering if you're going to lose all your money because they miss a quarter and they they didn't uh win the AI race?
[01:33:53] No. This is one you can sleep like a baby. It's been around since the 1800s. They always figure it out and um they
[01:34:00] they'll do that again. At eight times earnings, Fiser's priced for disaster with almost no positive expectations.
[01:34:07] The bar is extremely low and we expect upside surprises as execution improves and new growth engines show through. In
[01:34:14] the meantime, investors collect almost a 7% dividend yield while they wait for what we believe could be a double over
[01:34:20] the next few years. It's my kind of story. Downside protected, upside meaningful uh and low lower risk.
[01:34:30] Second defensive pick is Crown Castle, which we got to move through. It's a highquality Tower REIT that we began
[01:34:37] building a position during 2024 after a rate driven selloff cut the stock by more than half. The unwind in rate
[01:34:43] sensitive equities left Crown Castle at levels we view as overdone and we see it
[01:34:49] as a clean levered way to play the rate cycle and capital rotation back toward income as yields move lower. So this is
[01:34:57] a dividend payer. It's the leading pure play ta US tower company with 40,000 wireless towers
[01:35:04] nationwide. It leases space on its towers to the big three carriers which make up 75% of revenue creating durable
[01:35:12] demand and recurring revenue that have made towers one of the most attractive business models in the communications
[01:35:18] infrastructure. Strong mobile data growth along with
[01:35:23] rising AIdriven network needs leads us to expect five 5% organic same tower
[01:35:29] revenue growth over our forecast period with low capital requirements and massive operating leverage. Much of that
[01:35:34] growth should flow to the bottom line and support long-term compounding.
[01:35:40] So they got rid of the fiber business which was kind of a drag on investment. Uh and the second thing that they did
[01:35:49] was uh ju just a couple things on mobile data. Demand has grown by more than 30% annually for the past three years. Most
[01:35:56] people wouldn't guess that uh and is projected to compound at 15% through 2030. This sustained growth requires
[01:36:02] ongoing carrier investment to support higher traffic. And with 5G still in its early 20-year cycle, long run demand for
[01:36:09] tower infrastructure remains strong.
[01:36:15] So, Crown Castle's removed the two biggest overhangs, devesting the value destructive fiber segment and placing
[01:36:22] proven industry veteran Chris Hildebrand in the CEO role, which we view as a key catalyst to the turnaround. Together,
[01:36:29] these moves create a higher margin pure play tower operator that can return
[01:36:34] capital to shareholders on a massive scale through buybacks, through dividends, etc. They invested $19
[01:36:42] billion into the fiber with poor returns. They sold the segment for 8.5 billion. They will use the proceeds to
[01:36:49] delever the balance sheet and fund buybacks, making CCI a leaner, higher
[01:36:54] margin tower company with a very nice dividend. Uh leadership had been a revolving door.
[01:37:01] Hildebrandt is an industry veteran with more than three decades of telecom experience.
[01:37:07] rate relief ahead. Like REITs, like all REITs, CCI trades on interest rates and
[01:37:13] the 348 basis points rise in the 10-year from late 2021 to 2023 drove a nearly
[01:37:20] 60% draw down in the stock. Falling yields will unlock cheaper financing, lower interest rate burden for companies
[01:37:26] like CCI, which carries 24 billion in net debt and nearly 1 billion in annual
[01:37:31] interest expense. While the dividend remains neglected today, we expect CCI's
[01:37:37] 4.5% yield with total shareholder yield above 6% to become far more attractive
[01:37:42] as rates move lower and sideline capital is pushed back into yield. CCI is a pure
[01:37:48] play on the rate easing cycle with lower rates cutting interest costs, improving
[01:37:53] refinancing terms, strengthening tenant activity, and drawing investors back to dividend payers with total shareholder
[01:37:59] yield above 6% and a 50% price upside by our estimates. CCI stands out as a
[01:38:05] highquality name in a volatile midterm year. By the way, as always, this is all
[01:38:11] opinion, not advice. Consult with your psychic before doing anything. Yeah.
[01:38:24] going down. Yeah. A lot of the speakers this week have been talking about how evenffect.
[01:38:34] Yeah. What if I think there are another uh a lot that
[01:38:40] that's consensus right now. I think there are a lot of other factors at play. You have uh uh Besson has some
[01:38:46] programs to work on the 10-year yield explicitly, some some some programs that they're doing in terms of what they buy,
[01:38:52] where they sell along the curve. Uh stable coin demand is going to add an additional meaningful amount of demand
[01:38:58] for treasuries. Uh you can you can count on this administration getting rates
[01:39:03] down one way or another. and Hasset he I mean he's he's a complete uh in line
[01:39:09] let's just put it mildly in line with the ideas uh coming from the top as to where interest rates should be uh
[01:39:15] inflation be damned I mean they're going to bring rates down that that's what's going to happen and and at the long end
[01:39:21] I mean they can manage the curve by where they issue and what they buy in I you know we stop quantitative tightening
[01:39:27] in December uh that usually precedes the re recurrence of quantitative easing I'm
[01:39:33] not saying that we're going into quantitative easing, but I am saying there have been programs in the past that would be considered operation twist
[01:39:40] uh and the like, which a few of us with a couple of gray hairs remember. Uh so I'm I'm much more sanguin about rates
[01:39:47] because unlocking the housing market is dependent upon that and that is priority number one in the administration. So um
[01:39:54] I would keep that in mind. And finally, defensive pick number three is Hormemell
[01:40:00] Foods. started building this position 2024
[01:40:05] after rising input costs and poor execution push pushed the stock to multi-year lows. We've added on further weakness as this self-help story is
[01:40:12] priced like it's going out of business with protein demand for GLP1's trends as tailwinds. We see meaningful upside from
[01:40:19] here. Founded in 1891, something called the Lindy effect. Does
[01:40:25] anyone know what the Lindy effect is? The longer something has been in existence, the higher likelihood it it's
[01:40:32] to stay in existence for an equivalent amount of time. Uh, Google it or whatever, chat GP it grocket. Uh,
[01:40:39] founded uh, global branded food company with 12 billion in revenue across 80 countries and leading brands like
[01:40:45] Planters, Skippy, Spam, uh, Go and Applegate. The company holds the number one and number two share positions in
[01:40:52] more than 40 categories with retail making up about twothirds of the sales. food service 30% and international the
[01:40:59] rest. So you know since 1891 how many depressions how many recessions how many great financial crisis this business has
[01:41:07] endured and it will continue to too. Hormel is a dividend aristocrat having paid an uninterrupted quarterly dividend
[01:41:14] since 1928. They didn't even cut the dividend during the great depression. Never meant the great financial crisis.
[01:41:21] Oh, and by the way, they not only paid it, they raised it for 60 straight years, which makes it a dividend
[01:41:28] aristocrat. Today's yield is above 5%, the highest in decades with average net leverage at 1.5% and a payout ratio just
[01:41:35] under 80%. We view the dividend as highly secured with room for continued growth over time.
[01:41:41] Hormill's heavy exposure to perishable input 72% of 2024 sales has driven major
[01:41:47] commodity pressure with uh last quarter's beef near record highs. Pork bellies up 30% and wholesale pork up 10%
[01:41:54] resulting in a 400 basis points margin hit. Relief now appears underway as key
[01:41:59] input cost roll over and tariffs on 200 plus food products are rolled back. Uh
[01:42:05] if you look at the chart of hogs, if you start to look at feeder cattle and live cattle, they are rolling over. And when
[01:42:11] commodities turn, it's not like a modest pullback. It's like they collapse. And when they collapse, the margin of
[01:42:17] Hormell doubles and triples. It's it's a big big factor. Hormel is in the early
[01:42:22] innings of a margin recovery. As input costs ease, pricing actions catch up, and the TNM initiative drives meaningful
[01:42:29] cost savings. With recent operational hiccups fading and uh efficiency gains taking hold, we see a clear path back
[01:42:36] toward midcycle 10% plus margins over the next few years. Hormel is entering a
[01:42:41] new phase of growth supported by durable c customer shifts toward lean high protein eating, a core competitive
[01:42:47] advantage for Hormell with a decade low valuation, a clear path to 2 to 3% annual sales growth and margin recovery
[01:42:53] underway. We see the setup as highly attractive with material upside in a bumpy midterm year. So this is how you
[01:43:02] contact me. As I said, the the podcast on YouTube, hedge fun with Tom Hayes, or anywhere you get your podcast, Twitter,
[01:43:09] hedge fun. Our website is hedge fun.com if you want to contact us. And there's
[01:43:14] my email and phone number. We have exactly two minutes for questions. So if anyone has any, speak now or forever.
[01:43:20] Hold your peace. in your fund and what the lock
[01:43:25] uh million dollars and no lock up quarterly liquidity full transparency is a hedge fun
[01:43:32] uh we run it as separately managed accounts through interactive brokers so you own the account you can technically
[01:43:37] log in every day and see what's in your account uh full transparency full liquidity no no no lockup great capital
[01:43:45] is the management company it's an LLC there's no pass
[01:43:50] no there's no pass because you you own account, whether it's in your name or in your IRA or in a corporation or trust.
[01:43:56] Uh you'll set it up with Interactive Brokers. All we do is manage it. We have uh investing privileges only. Um if you
[01:44:04] want to take money out, you just log into your account and take money out. Yeah. And what what is your fee on like a
[01:44:11] million dollar portfolio? Are you invested in a thousand stocks or
[01:44:16] No, we we run a concentrated portfolio of 8 to 12 stocks. um that makes up 85
[01:44:21] to 90% of the portfolio. 10% is a derivative overlay for excess returns on
[01:44:26] the core positions and also hedging to dampen volatility when we think the market's overvalued. Uh the per
[01:44:32] performance fee ranges from 25% down to 15% depending on the size of the account. And then there's also something
[01:44:38] we call a high watermark. So not only do we not get paid until your account goes up, we don't get paid again until we
[01:44:44] earn back 100% of what we got paid. Um, so, um, it's, you know, I set it up that
[01:44:50] way. One, I copied Buffett when he was running his partnerships, and two, it's the only deal that I would accept on the other side of the table. I wouldn't want
[01:44:55] people getting paid whether my account went up or down. I want them getting paid when it goes up. So,
[01:45:02] pay out or what's that? How long did you get paid? Well, the the Interactive Brokers looks
[01:45:08] at it quarterly and it just looks back infinite quarters to see what is the highest level that the account has ever
[01:45:14] closed at. And if it's above the highest level the account has ever closed at, it's the split whether it's 8020 to the
[01:45:20] client uh or or less or more depending on the size of the account and you would get paid through a
[01:45:25] separate uh payment outside the account. No, it's it's done within the account. Yeah, it's a retirement account.
[01:45:32] Yeah, correct. It's it's automatically done by Interactive Brokers. Yeah.
[01:45:39] So, we can discuss that on Friday when we talk. Yeah. Go ahead. You ever play an ETF or just model? No,
[01:45:45] because you can't really do derivatives, right? And um the reason we run in separate, this is a key point. I'm glad
[01:45:51] you brought it up. The reason we run in separately managed accounts versus a co-mingled fund is because we want to
[01:45:58] put new clients in those stocks that we believe are just leaving the station versus the stocks that are up 50 60 70%
[01:46:04] in the last 6 or 12 months. So we, you know, cuz if if we put them in the ones like in a co-mingled fund, you're forced
[01:46:10] into everything that's already gone up a lot. Whereas with separately managed accounts, I can put them in the eight or
[01:46:16] 12 that that I think are just getting ready to take off. And that has a huge impact on IRRa because, you know, I
[01:46:23] could put them in Alibaba at 160 when everyone else has a 70 or $80 basis, but
[01:46:29] the move from 70 to 160. Um, you know, as it goes from 160 to
[01:46:36] 320, the IRRa is not as aggressive versus if they had that low basis. So
[01:46:42] that's that's not one that we would aggressively put a brand new one in because it's already made half of its
[01:46:47] move. We want to put them in the horses of the world and the things that are just getting going. Yeah.
[01:46:54] Yeah. What is your minimum investment? It's a million bucks. 1 million.
[01:47:00] Yeah. Yeah. Uh 1 million for individuals, 5 million for family offices, 10 million for
[01:47:06] institutions.
[01:47:11] turns to have higher debt levels than it depends. Uh some of them do, some of
[01:47:18] them don't. Uh you know, Baba had no net debt. Um but the first thing we do, as we covered yesterday, is we we deal with
[01:47:25] solveny risk. We look at the balance sheet first because if it's down a lot, there's a reason the market's afraid of
[01:47:30] certain things. Uh and then once we get comfortable with free cash flow relative to interest debt service and the trae
[01:47:36] trajectory of the turnaround then we can feel comfortable going into it. Yeah. And you know that debt you know you got
[01:47:42] to understand it's secured by assets too. The towers it's like it's like someone looks at a REIT like look at all
[01:47:47] the debt but look at all the real estate that's that's you know uh the over coverage of that
[01:47:53] debt relative to the underlying asset. So in terms of like REITs it can be misleading. Yeah.
[01:48:00] Was there one more question? Yeah. Both taxable and non-T taxable. Yeah, we do both. Yeah. Our average
[01:48:07] holding period is three years. So even for taxable accounts, you're you're dealing with long-term capital gains for the most part. We don't like to sell
[01:48:14] stuff. Yeah. And we're back. And the quote of the week uh from Buffett, you
[01:48:19] do things when the opportunities come along. I've had periods in my life when I've had a bundle of ideas come along
[01:48:25] and I've had long dry spells. If I get an idea next week, I'll do something. If not, I won't do a damn thing. And that's
[01:48:30] exactly how we operate here. That's why it took us so long to get the additional healthcare name, the additional
[01:48:36] discretionary name, the restaurant name that we wanted to get. It took a long time to find out which was the right one
[01:48:41] at the right time at the right price with the upside. That makes sense. You cover the downside, the upside takes care of itself.
[01:48:49] Second quote from Seth Clarman. There's so much thing there's no such thing as a value company. Price is all that
[01:48:55] matters. At some price, an asset is a buy. at another it's a hold and at another it's a sell. And finally, uh,
[01:49:03] two new inductees into our hedge fun tips community, Albert and Joanne and
[01:49:08] Robert. Awesome job. Awesome meeting you down there. Keep the photos coming in coming in, ladies and gentlemen. Um, and
[01:49:16] uh, appreciate you guys being generous and unselfish and uh, and getting that over. Appreciate the orders. you know,
[01:49:23] if you're not comfortable, uh, we we just put your first initial of your last name, but, uh, it's very much
[01:49:29] appreciated. All right, let's get down to data. LG exports to hit monthly record. Cppler data shows we love that,
[01:49:35] Mr. Comtock Resources Fed put is alive and well. You can see when the odds of a
[01:49:40] hike went, excuse me, when the odds of a cut went up, the market rebounded for the follow-through I covered on Vney
[01:49:47] this morning. You'll see that next week when Ze is done with it. Um, we talked
[01:49:53] about the only thing that could screw up strength into end of year would be Jay Powell if he uh shocks the market with a
[01:50:01] hold versus a cut uh when 90% is baked in. I don't think he will. He gets to go
[01:50:08] out like Seinfeld if he does it right at the top of his game. And um and that
[01:50:13] would bode well for year end uh strength. uh small caps being the strongest during this time of year
[01:50:19] starting on the 15th of the month and going through March. Uh number of IPOs has been picking up year-to- date on
[01:50:25] track for the best year since 2014. Very good to see. Uh here is US commodity
[01:50:32] price index versus total relative return. Uh inflation sensitive stock index.
[01:50:40] So um commodity index has that come down and oil the index has come down. It looks
[01:50:47] like it's at or near an inflection uh which we agree. Fed set to shift from
[01:50:52] large seller of treasuries to one of the largest buyers in 2026. That will help
[01:50:58] the long end of the curve. That'll help real estate. That will help a lot of our plays levered to interest rates along with the Fed following through with
[01:51:05] another few cuts. quantitative tightening and September
[01:51:11] 2019 was the start of a 17% rally in equities.
[01:51:16] Uh so that's what we're seeing and we'll see if we get a similar type of
[01:51:22] situation. Four of four times December is positive.
[01:51:28] Small cap ETF inflow starting to rip, ladies and gentlemen. But if you look out on the longer term,
[01:51:37] that's the rolling 65 days. If you look over the one year, it looks like it's bottoming out just like it did in uh
[01:51:44] 2020 before rip roaring rally. Number of public companies fell precipitously
[01:51:49] marking a bull case for stocks. You see the uh because there's no supply. That supply is going to change. You've heard
[01:51:55] rumblings. There was an article this morning about Open AI and some of the others needing to go public to retain talent. that game will just get started.
[01:52:03] That should help the banks. If we can find a period where we get weakness again, we would be a buyer. Uh you're
[01:52:08] going to benefit from that. Even buying uh small caps because you'll have exposure to regional banks at the
[01:52:15] very least, which is levered to that. Uh tech sector versus midcap stocks. You can see this divergence always closes
[01:52:22] and I think the real economy is going to rip. That's going to be the theme in 2026. Healthc care sector waiting in the
[01:52:28] S&P 500. You can see the lowest since 2000 and then going back to 1994. Both
[01:52:34] preceded multi-year historic long rallies which is why we wanted to
[01:52:39] supplement Baxter with Fizer uh along with the um
[01:52:45] uh remaining XBI basket of biotech which has just been on a complete rip roaring
[01:52:51] rally. US faces impending power crisis. uh peak supply needed, peak supply
[01:52:58] anticipated. That's where Generrack and Comtock come in. Deep down discounts Europe versus US 12-month forward price
[01:53:05] to earnings ratio. Uh the biggest discount is consumer discretionary and
[01:53:10] energy uh in Europe relative to the US. So there's some opportunities there.
[01:53:17] Tech capex as a percentage of the S&P 500 higher than the peak in 2000.
[01:53:23] Equities typically rise following midterm elections. We covered that with
[01:53:28] Stu. You tend to get some weakness in the pre uh uh midterm election years.
[01:53:34] Tends to be the worst. We covered it on the money show. S&P on average up only 2.4%. Healthcare up on average 9%.
[01:53:41] That's why we wanted to make sure we were positioned ahead of that. Um private investors have found more value
[01:53:48] in public equity in recent years. We agree. value stocks uh more frequently
[01:53:53] taken private especially during the year of rising rates and lower marks. US data center buildout status by year of
[01:54:00] construction or planning and gigawatts capacity uh cloud foreign investor ownership
[01:54:07] share of US equity market it's at a record high at 18%. This is now changing with the weakening dollar because if
[01:54:14] they get a you know 10% return uh when adjusted for currency it starts to be
[01:54:20] less attractive and I think you're going to see continued theme into emerging markets uh which is going to be uh and
[01:54:27] and XUS that we've already seen that was a big theme coming into 2025
[01:54:34] and it uh outperformed the US by 2 to one China 3 to one uh I think we see a
[01:54:39] continuation of that theme moving forward. Cloud sales growth who's number
[01:54:46] one Google 108% who's number two is Alibaba 93% cloud sales growth AWS is
[01:54:55] only 54% Microsoft is 44% bu is 18%.
[01:55:00] Hyperscalers are now more capital intensive than oil majors. Uh so uh and
[01:55:06] yet they have a high multiple we've covered that last week. 6 million65 plus
[01:55:12] households live in relatively large houses. I think those are going to get hit the hardest. Um uh when they all hit
[01:55:20] the market at once. All it takes is one or two negative comps. You're seeing it already in Florida. You're seeing it in parts of Texas. It will spread. Uh US
[01:55:29] real GDP. Yes, that's in the face of rates going lower, ladies and gentlemen, because that's going to actually create
[01:55:34] more supply this cycle. That's going to be the big surprise, but uh no one believes it. So, we'll just talk about
[01:55:39] it like when we talked about the dollar getting weaker and no one believed that and when we talked about uh a three
[01:55:46] handle on the 10-year before a five handle when it was at 492 uh no one believed that but um rinse and repeat
[01:55:54] ladies and gentlemen US real GDP growth uh troughing next year uh is the
[01:55:59] expectation by morning star and then reacelerating into the end which would imply weaker indices and uh stock
[01:56:07] picking uh being a highly prized skill set. Our framework has led us into a
[01:56:14] number of staples and healthcare and defensive stocks. That's not because we're taking a guess on whether the
[01:56:20] market is going to be choppy. That's because that's where the value is showing up and that's what usually
[01:56:25] happens preceding a period of outperformance. uh
[01:56:32] forward 12-month net income estimates continue to rise with small caps exhibiting the strongest trend, ladies
[01:56:38] and gentlemen. Highest earnings growth, lowest multiple. That's where you want to put your money and you want to get
[01:56:43] your money in before December 15th because that's the inflection point where small caps start to outperform for
[01:56:49] the next three and a half months. If you're a tactical trader, we are not, but this is a good entry point.
[01:56:58] Fed cut plus expansion on average 12 months out 16.5%.
[01:57:04] Right now GDP now is at 3.9%. So that implies a continued expansion which implies a less bad midterm election year
[01:57:12] than normal. The normal midterm election years have 17.3% draw downs on average.
[01:57:18] Um I think that since we've had 320% in the last 5 years when you generally get
[01:57:23] one every three and a half years, it's pulled forward a lot of that stuff. people have recency bias so they expect it again. I think the 10 to 15 you know
[01:57:31] normal 10 11 percent 13% um which happen every 13 months is more likely in 2026
[01:57:40] then is a big uh um hard correction
[01:57:49] relative return during interest rate regimes biotech and other potentially rate sensitive cohorts
[01:57:56] um when it's high and falling biotech tends to do the best
[01:58:04] uh and uh and biotech generally. So we have exposure there increase in data
[01:58:10] center power demand outlook again that's a com stock story clue that December
[01:58:15] could be strong when the market's up 10% uh by the end of October December is better than normal usually it's 1.2% 2%
[01:58:23] for the S&P. Uh in that these conditions it tends to be 2%. So we'll see if that
[01:58:28] holds true this year.
[01:58:34] Fed funds policy tracks consumer sentiment on jobs. More cuts to come. So consumer sentiment uh has been very low.
[01:58:43] Fed's funds coming down and will continue to come down. uh I covered on
[01:58:50] the big money show. Uh it'll be the limbo. How low can you go if Hassid is the pick? In fact, uh annual change in
[01:58:58] hyperscaler long-term debt, bonds, loans, and leases. Uh it's gone up 5x.
[01:59:05] No, no, it's gone up 10x in the last 12 months. Uh most capex, cash flow
[01:59:11] declining. We covered it all on the uh third presentation at the money show. Uh
[01:59:17] that's not where I want to be, ladies and gentlemen. I can tell you that right now. Cash flow declining, earnings growth declining. Uh interest expense
[01:59:24] increasing. It's uh formula for a re dating, not a rerating. PayPal rerating.
[01:59:30] Baba rerated. Intel rerated. Mag 7, you're going to see some drating in
[01:59:36] 2026. U and you already saw a little bit of it in November for sure.
[01:59:42] US 10-year bond yield versus relative total return.
[01:59:47] How low will bond yields go once bond investors follow equity investors and
[01:59:53] finally give up the inflation ghost? And I think the answer is
[02:00:00] a lot lower. And I think that uh I don't know if we're going to get that. Uh
[02:00:06] we'll see what happens after the Fed meeting. I'd been saying when when mortgage rates were 7% earlier, I said
[02:00:14] we're going to see a five handle like 599 on a 30-year fix before the end of the year. We got down to 615. We were
[02:00:22] damn close. Let's see what happens in the next few weeks if the Fed does the right thing. Uh could be pretty exciting. Relative price of S&P cyclical
[02:00:29] sectors versus 10-year yield. Less Fed funds yield curve. You can see here
[02:00:34] again at an inflection for cyclical sectors which we love to hear.
[02:00:42] Uh Microsoft's capex to sales ratio dwarfs Exxons.
[02:00:48] Santa comes later in September. You can see a bottoming around the 15th and then a rally into year end. That's from
[02:00:53] Carson. Black Friday spending over the years. We
[02:01:00] had a good year in 2025, up 8.33%.
[02:01:05] CBO estimates that one big beautiful bill will boost GDP growth by 9/10en of
[02:01:10] a percent in 2026. The tax refunds, there is a lot of stimulus and I think that's going to offset the normal very
[02:01:18] aggressive um volatility in a midterm election year. I think it will be more
[02:01:23] subdued volatility, yes, but less so due to the fiscal input impulse and um and
[02:01:31] the Fed easing cycle and the end of quantitative tightening and the resumption of uh uh bond buying in the
[02:01:37] market, lowering yields, 12-month trailing return contribution,
[02:01:44] earnings and contribution in local currency. Uh you can see here emerging
[02:01:50] markets topping S&P at the bottom. This is earnings
[02:01:55] growth and where it came from. Worst performing stocks in the S&P 500.
[02:02:01] Look in this list for opportunities for 2026. A lot of healthc care. Copart is one of
[02:02:07] the best businesses uh out there. That's come down a lot. That might be worth uh us taking a look at. uh note to team uh
[02:02:17] Dow potentially worth taking a look at note to team uh those are the two I like from there
[02:02:25] earnings acceleration you can see here in 2025 we've been
[02:02:31] covering that it's now happening natural gas turning up aggressively on the cold
[02:02:37] weather home D-listings hit the highest September level since 2020 2017 they're
[02:02:43] realizing It's now moving from a sellers market to a buyer's market and they'll
[02:02:49] they will delist and then one of their neighbors will not delist and the
[02:02:56] purchase price will come in much lower than anyone would expected and people
[02:03:01] will panic and start to all list at once which will drive the comps down further.
[02:03:07] No one is expecting this. this will be the case from a guy who's not a real estate guy, but I'm telling you, we we
[02:03:14] will see this over the next 12 to 18 months. Um, yes, I bought the top. Uh,
[02:03:21] but it was not a financial decision. Although I did I did get a really good deal on it and uh I think I got a strong
[02:03:27] enough margin of safety and it was a very creative thing that I did. But nonetheless, it I was against the trend it anyway.
[02:03:35] Happy wife, happy life. So, move along. Uh, Kobe letter buy now pay later sales
[02:03:41] are now expected to hit a record 20 billion between November 1st and December 31st. Uh, this helps who? It
[02:03:48] helps uh PayPal who has 20% growth in buy now pay later.
[02:03:58] 2026 forecast. Deutsche Bank at the top. First time I've ever seen a European bank the most bullish on record, which
[02:04:05] makes me very damn skeptical because they're always bearish. They're even more bearish in the hole. So now they've
[02:04:12] drank the Kool-Aid. I would say it's going to be much more subdued than Deutsche Bank thinks. Um,
[02:04:18] and that's that. All right, we covered this. When the market's up
[02:04:24] through, you know, October, you get a better than average December. We'll see if that happens. This year has been the
[02:04:29] year of opposites. So, I look, I could see Powell screw it up. I could literally see that happen. Market dump
[02:04:35] 10% the end of the year. Um, I wouldn't I wouldn't make major bets on that at
[02:04:41] all. Uh, I'm more inclined to think we're going to get the natural Santa Claus rally, but that's consensus right now. And I've seen Powell do some stupid
[02:04:48] things over the years, particularly December two, 2018 when he said autopilot and the market tanked like 18%
[02:04:55] in three weeks um until Minutian had to come bail him out and call all the banks
[02:05:00] together on the Sunday before Christmas. Listed global REITs are trading near historically cheap relative valuations
[02:05:06] to equities going all the way back to the financial crisis. There's some opportunity there. We have it through
[02:05:12] Crown Castle, baby. All right, rolling four-week average. Communication service
[02:05:17] flows record lows since 2018. Institutional clients were the biggest buyers ne last week. Hedge funds were
[02:05:25] the largest net sellers. We'll see who wins that argument. Money market assets
[02:05:30] surpass 8 trillion. That's going to change aggressively as rates go down and the 4% with your eyes closed goes away
[02:05:38] turns to 3%. They will be pushed into dividend payers which have been neglected and we will be the
[02:05:43] beneficiaries.
[02:05:48] Seasonal pattern for uh this is from Hirs over at Stock Traders Almanac. You
[02:05:53] can see here where small caps bottom mid December and they go straight up through March. So that should help um
[02:06:02] number of the positions that we have as small caps, the goosees, the Coopers, Standards, etc.
[02:06:08] Short interest at a record high in treasuries. We like that. This means bond yields lower. This means uh
[02:06:14] quantitative tightening over and buyers in the market.
[02:06:20] New medium home price divided by average hourly earnings is going down making it
[02:06:27] more affordable. So that means wage growth is outpacing home price growth. So that's positive to see.
[02:06:35] It's healthy. non-farm payrolls versus ADP. That's
[02:06:40] going in a direction that should continue to force the hand. We do have PCE inflation tomorrow, which is a
[02:06:45] worry. If that came in super hot, it might give Powell the uh opportunity to
[02:06:50] uh leave Trump uh u unhealthy present on his front doormat, but uh more likely
[02:06:57] than not, it'll come around in line and they will follow through with what the market expects. GDP now 3.9%

[02:11:38] delivered a softer than expected third quarter revenue with$ 1.1 billion dollars down 5% year-on-year missing
[02:11:44] estimates by 79 million and adjusted EPS of 183 down 19% missing estimates of 37
[02:11:52] uh cents the misforced management missing by 37 cents the misforced management to lower fullear guidance net
[02:11:59] sales now expected flat yearon-year uh and adj previously plus 2 to 5%
[02:12:04] adjusted eBay of margins tracking to 17% previously 18 to 19%. On the surface,
[02:12:10] the numbers look ugly, but the story is far less dramatic than the headline suggests. The entire shortfall was
[02:12:16] driven by an unusually quiet hurricane season that weighed heavily on Generrack's high highest margin
[02:12:21] breadandbut home standby generator business. While great weather is a win for almost everyone, when your core
[02:12:28] product only sell when the lights go out, sunshine can be a gut punch to demand. Q3 delivered the lowest outage
[02:12:33] hours since 2015, running 75 to 80% below the long-term average. All against
[02:12:40] a tough comp from last year's three major storms and the highest outage quarter since 2012. Tough setup, zero
[02:12:47] help from mother nature, entirely predictable outcome.
[02:12:54] When mother nature is your business partner, these lumpy quarters are unavoidable. They can cut both ways. We
[02:13:00] have zero to do with management exe. They have zero to do with management execution and are simply table stakes in
[02:13:07] backup power. Always have been, always will be. Zoom out. And this quote unquote weak quarter is pure noise. We
[02:13:15] didn't buy gener to play the weather prediction business. We bought a highquality secular compounder with 75%
[02:13:21] plus share in a market where US house household penetration is still only 6.5%.
[02:13:28] Every additional point of penetration is a $4 billion opportunity waiting to be
[02:13:34] captured. Until that math changes, we're happy to hold the Kleenex of generators and leave the weather forecasting to
[02:13:42] someone else. What we do care about and what led the market to look past the soft hurricane season and shrug off the
[02:13:48] myths in about five minutes is that investors are beginning to sniff out that Gener has quietly become a backdoor
[02:13:55] way to play the data center buildout and the AI infrastructure arms race. Even better, it offers that exposure at a
[02:14:02] reasonable valuation. The new large megawatt generations generators which management calls the biggest
[02:14:07] needlemoving opportunity in company history. biggest needle moving opportunity in company history began
[02:14:14] shipping in Q3 with the global backlog more than doubling o to over 300 million
[02:14:20] in the last 90 days. This these school busiz units, $1.5 to $2 million each,
[02:14:27] could drive what management views as a potentially doubling of the uh commercial and industrial business, CNI,
[02:14:35] which is $1.5 billion today. Over the next three to five years, Gener is
[02:14:41] already preparing to ramp up capacity from a $500 million run rate today to nearly $1 billion to capture what they
[02:14:48] believe is a structural $5 billion plus supply deficit. With data center power
[02:14:54] demand exploding, even Uncle Sam is starting to take notice and exploring whether large-scale generators can
[02:15:00] bridge as much as 35 gigawatts of the projected shortfall while the
[02:15:06] grid catches up. With only a handful of credible players able to build these at scale, one phone call from the
[02:15:12] government would max out Generrack's production capacity overnight. Here's the article. USDI's diesel generators to
[02:15:19] meet growing AI power demand.
[02:15:26] Uh let's see why this got stuck while we're waiting for that to re.
[02:15:32] Okay, site back up. So with data pan center power demand exploding, even
[02:15:38] Uncle Sam is starting to take notice and exploring whether large scale generators can bridge as much as 35 gawatts of the
[02:15:44] projected shortfall with only a handful of credible players to build these at scale. One phone call from the government can max out generics
[02:15:50] production capacity overnight. We are waiting for that phone call. This is what happens when you own a great
[02:15:56] business as a reasonable price. Upside surprises tend to show up along the way. Gener is a textbook example in real time
[02:16:02] and our expectations for this high quality secular grower continue to power higher.
[02:16:08] Nice pun there. Uh top 10 key points. We're going to let you go through those
[02:16:14] at your own at hedge funfips.com. Uh we've got a lot of content this week.
[02:16:20] So read through these. Uh it's a summary of what we've covered. Go through the uh
[02:16:26] earnings call which we uh highlighted the key important parts. Stanley Black & Decker update key points we want to
[02:16:32] cover with you. Number one, Stanley Black & Decker boasted 3.8 billion in third quarter revenue, flat
[02:16:37] year-over-year and in line with expectations. Adjusted earnings growth came in at 143, up from 122 last year
[02:16:42] ahead of consensus by 24 cents. Reported a 25-cent tax benefit that had previously been expected to fall in the
[02:16:48] fourth quarter. Two, adjusted gross margins, the key metric in the turnaround story, reached 31.6 in the
[02:16:54] quarter, up 110 basis points year-on-year by pricing gains and supply chain transformation. management expects
[02:17:00] further expansion in QR Q4 tracking near 33% and believes the company is on pace
[02:17:05] to achieve or be very close to its long-term 35% gross margin target by the end of 2026. Last time it traded back
[02:17:11] there a handful of years ago. At those margins, the stock was 150 bucks. So three engineered fastening statement
[02:17:18] posted uh net sales of 51 million, up 3% year-on-year and 5% organically.
[02:17:24] performance was driven by continued strength in aerospace with more than 25% organic growth and better than expected
[02:17:30] results in automotive which delivered low singledigit organic growth. Four tools and outdoor segment delivered 3.26
[02:17:37] billion in sales in line with last year's third quarter price. Uh uh the business continues to operate in a
[02:17:43] subdued but relatively stable DI DIY market with another low round of low singledigit price increases going into
[02:17:50] effect in Q4. Devault, the $7 billion franchise brand focused on the pro
[02:17:55] market, delivered another strong quarter of organic growth, outpacing the broader marketplace on the back of resilient professional demand. Six, management
[02:18:02] continues to advance tariff mitigation strategies, aiming to reduce the share of US supply source from China down to
[02:18:07] 5% by year end. At the same time, they're rapidly increasing USMCA compliant production in Mexico and see
[02:18:12] no structural hurdles to reaching average MSAA compliance for industrial companies over the medium term.
[02:18:21] Taken together, management believes these efforts can remove the 200 to $300 million of tariff expense from the
[02:18:26] system in 2026. Seven, the global cost reduction program launched in 2022, targeting 2 billion in savings, remains
[02:18:33] on track for completion by the end of 2025. The quarter added another 120 million of incremental pre-tax run rate
[02:18:38] savings, bringing the total savings to 1.9 billion, spread across the 155 million shares outstanding. The program
[02:18:43] works out to just under $13 per share in savings by year end 2025.
[02:18:50] Wait till topline in flex. How that just pours to the bottom line to the owners,
[02:18:56] which we are eight. Stanley Black & Generate 155 million of free cash flow
[02:19:02] in the quarter, bringing year-to- date uh cash flow to an outflow of 195. Management still expects to generate
[02:19:08] $600 million of free cash flow for the full year, unchanged from prior guidance supported by more than 500 million of
[02:19:13] working capital reductions in Q4. Looking ahead to 2026, they plan to reduce inventories by at least 200
[02:19:19] million, setting up another solid year of cash flow generation. Nine, management's near-term priority remains debt reduction to maintain its
[02:19:25] investment grade credit rating with a 500 million maturity coming up in Q126. They're targeting an asset sale in the
[02:19:32] next 12 months to support additional deleveraging and once leverage moves below 2.5 times excess capital will
[02:19:38] shift toward opportunistic buybacks and 10 management loaded full gear guidance trimming 2025 adjusted EPS to 455 from
[02:19:45] 465 due to higher than expected production cost tied to tariffs and supply changes chain changes. They now
[02:19:51] expect total revenue to be flat to down 1% and are tracking toward the low end of that range. Most importantly, the long-term targets laid out at the
[02:19:58] November 2024 capital markets day remain appropriate and achievable. They'll likely push out by one year to 2028
[02:20:04] because of tariffs. So, that's the story. Enabled us to increase our position. Thank you, President Trump. Uh
[02:20:11] and um that's the story. Fear is at 26. That sets up nicely into the Fed
[02:20:17] meeting. Uh catch catch people off sides and and hopefully some strength into year end as long as Powell follows
[02:20:24] through. So load let's do healthcare earnings uh top 30 stocks revised down 36 basis
[02:20:31] points for next year. Uh and then the second group is financials earnings
[02:20:38] revised up 2.89% uh in the last 60 days. So that's
[02:20:43] positive to see. Let's see if we can get this article back online.
[02:20:49] Okay, looking at data, the ISM manufacturing came in a little bit of weaker. Manufacturing prices came in a
[02:20:55] little weaker on Monday. Uh ADP non-farm payroll came in much weaker than expected. So now the only
[02:21:02] hurdle to guaranteeing uh continuing claims and initial jobless claims were
[02:21:07] lower than expected. So that's um showing some strength. Uh GDP now still
[02:21:13] at 3.8%. So the big thing is tomorrow this core PC price index provided this
[02:21:19] is not egregiously over 3% uh or egregiously over.3% expectations
[02:21:26] are 0.2% month-on-month 2.9% year-onear we will get the cut. I mean if this came
[02:21:31] in at 3536 uh that might be a little jarring uh for
[02:21:37] the market but um it should be okay should be okay based on the other stuff we look at. All right, now let's get on
[02:21:44] to the ask me anything questions and then I'm going to get on a flight. Here we go. Uh, Marcel
[02:21:50] Bala, chemical stock, company stocks are are very cheap right now. Do you think this
[02:21:56] will turn around and the sector will become profitable again? Never. We are never going to use chemicals again ever
[02:22:02] in our life. It's over. They're all going to zero. I would stay away.
[02:22:08] I'm kidding. Of course, they're going to come back. You just got to pick the right ones that can withstand if the
[02:22:14] cycle takes longer than you expect. Diane Stiller, could you give me your thoughts on DXY for 2026? Lower over
[02:22:21] time. No change there. Gasper Mohoric
[02:22:27] question about PayPal.
[02:22:34] Yeah, this is the exact type of questions that we got on Baba. What if this time is different? Blah blah blah.
[02:22:39] Bottom line, free cash flow is going up, earnings are going up, revenues are going up, margins are going up. No one
[02:22:44] wants the stock. It's trading at half its historic multiple with reaceleration, 100 million active users
[02:22:52] on Venmo, uh 1.7 billion, 438
[02:22:58] uh globally, uh largest P2P system, buy now pay later growing. They brought in
[02:23:03] the ad guy from Amazon Web Services. Uh the business is hitting on all
[02:23:08] cylinders. Al Alex Chris is doing what he needs to do and this thing will be back. And and by the way, they keep
[02:23:14] buying in 10% of the company every year with their $7 billion of free cash flow. So, you know, after a handful of years,
[02:23:20] each slice is going to be so big without putting new money anyway, even if they don't execute, but they are executing.
[02:23:26] So, that's why we continue to buy more. I wish it would just go down to 49 to get rid of all the whiny little
[02:23:33] so then we can go straight up to 150, but you know, it is what it is. X-ray. Uh, this looks like a death now. Let's
[02:23:40] just see here. This is going to take a long time to build a base, even if we like it. Let's take a look.
[02:23:49] Uh, free cash flow and revenues are showing no signs of recovering yet. So,
[02:23:54] just keep an eye on it. My guess is, um, let's just see the balance sheet
[02:24:00] here.
[02:24:20] All right. So, they got a billion of cash and receivables. Long-term debts two billion. So, you
[02:24:26] just have to find out when all that matures. What's the free cash flow?
[02:24:37] 80 million. Yeah, this is not one that I'm in love with. I think uh
[02:24:47] I think it could work, but I think it's going to take longer
[02:24:55] than you think. So,
[02:25:01] I'd like I'd like to see a couple quarters of um I would like to see a couple of quarters
[02:25:07] of uh accelerating free cash flow, earnings, and revenue,
[02:25:13] and then uh it'll build a base from there. All right, next question.
[02:25:19] Jay apt, what platform do you use? Um we're using Koifin for this exercise. K
[02:25:26] O Y F I N Michael U. My friends and I tune into
[02:25:31] the pot every week now.
[02:25:39] Uh he's asking about free cash flow and refinancing. They'll be fine. Uh Michael K, can you look at salonies? We look at
[02:25:46] it all the time. There's some risk, but it probably works over time. Uh I think
[02:25:52] it's okay. CE balance sheets a little levered. That's where you could get hit. If it takes longer to turn than
[02:25:58] expected, um, you could have a donut hole, but I don't foresee that happening, and I kind of like it. So,
[02:26:06] uh, let's just take a look here.
[02:26:12] 1.4 billion. So, three billion there. What's the debt?
[02:26:19] So, they got a billion due. They got 11 billion of debt. That's the problem. It's just a little bit levered, but it's
[02:26:25] kind of okay. What's the free cash flow? Yeah, billion.
[02:26:31] Let's take a look at the income statement.
[02:26:39] 10 billion.
[02:26:48] Yeah, I think you're I think it's it's interesting. It's a little bit risky on the balance sheet side. Um,
[02:26:57] which is why we'd probably hesitate to do it for clients, but uh, I think it's certainly Okay, let's look at the next
[02:27:04] one, which is Tyler Hung, longtime listener, watcher, saw your
[02:27:10] segment on Fizer. How do you view them versus Merc Bristol
[02:27:15] Myers Roen down? Blah blah blah. uh less downside
[02:27:20] better upside in our view. We picked it for a reason. We always look at the the peers and that was the best one. Luke
[02:27:27] Garnett Garnett uh at college learning multiples DCF approaches to valuations
[02:27:34] uh put a bigger emphasis on it multiples ignoring them. No, you do it all and
[02:27:39] then you learn from experience what what's most salient in each industry, in
[02:27:44] each company, what moves the needle. You got to learn all of it and then over time and experience you'll figure out
[02:27:50] what works best for your framework. But yeah, you have to know how to do a DCF. That's uh investing 101. Manfred man, uh
[02:27:57] Tom, like your show, like your spirit. Uh Ivonic Industries.
[02:28:04] Let's try that. Uh
[02:28:16] well, it's not coming up at all. So, um
[02:28:21] that's odd. Okay, I'll try advanced search.
[02:28:28] Evanick. Oh, here we go.
[02:28:37] Wait a second. E B O N I K.
[02:28:43] It's a pink sheets in the US.
[02:28:50] Uh what do they do?
[02:28:56] Specialty chemicals.
[02:29:10] Uh there are there are a ton of better chemical companies than that. Uh I'd, you know, look at uh
[02:29:21] Dow, Lionel, Basil, etc. I'd look at a bunch of those before that. Nomad Foods.
[02:29:26] This has been a dog forever. I don't think I would buy this one. Let's take a look.
[02:29:56] This is a very low compounder. Um, see what the what do they actually do,
[02:30:15] Bird's Eye, Green Cuisine, Aunt Bessie's Good Fellas. I, you know,
[02:30:22] I don't, this hasn't been around long enough for me to be excited. I I would say um
[02:30:32] I think it's going to work for a bounce. I don't think it's a good enough quality business that I want to own it. Or would I buy the whole company? So therefore,
[02:30:38] I'm a pass. Mario Gersonner
[02:30:44] A R E
[02:30:50] Alexandria realy this is apartments
[02:30:58] uh you really have to underwrite the buildings multifamily in aggregate I mean people
[02:31:04] who know what they're doing it's always going to be a great time uh this one.
[02:31:18] I kind of like it, but say that that being said, I don't know the building. So, I'd have to go through
[02:31:24] every single building and underwrite it and understand what was in this. Um, in
[02:31:31] which case you're probably better off just buying, you know, IYR if you want to play a rates
[02:31:38] or even better CCI, which is Comtock. Uh, not Comtock, Crown Castle. Um,
[02:31:53] 13 billion of debt.
[02:32:00] 32 billion of assets.
[02:32:05] I mean, this one's probably okay. I I just would have to do a ton more work to
[02:32:12] buy a share, and I'm not going to do that. So, Bob
[02:32:17] Balmarked, been following your podcast
[02:32:23] since 25 years. We've only been going for six, but okay. I like it a lot.
[02:32:29] Intel, Baba, Albamaro, VF Corp are the best stocks ever. Uh,
[02:32:37] if you had new money, do you have any new horses to unleash? Well, we covered two today.
[02:32:46] Uh, Crown Castle, Orl, Dagio, Baxter, would you bet your last dime on them. I'd never bet my last dime on anything.
[02:32:53] I I own a basket of them uh with 98% of my net worth right alongside clients. So
[02:32:59] uh along with the others that have been up huge. So I think these are going to be the winners in 2026.
[02:33:05] Um and by the way, don't ask six questions in one email, please, because that's uh not allowing enough time for
[02:33:13] other people to ask questions. Uh Bristol Meyers uh it's not for us, but um we like
[02:33:21] Fizer, but thank you. Thank you so much for finally sending in a question, Bob. I hope that was helpful. Joe
[02:33:27] Jolo SBA, I don't like any of the cable uh
[02:33:33] companies, no matter how cheap they get.
[02:33:43] Take a quick look at it for fun.
[02:33:59] Oh, wireless communication infrastructure towers building rooftop distributed small. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[02:34:05] Okay. SBAC. Uh, I mean,
[02:34:12] it's a lower quality, similar story. We prefer
[02:34:18] what we have um in terms of management, in terms of
[02:34:24] assets, etc. We've looked at this one in the past. Uh we'd stick with uh with
[02:34:29] what we have for that kind of group in the re Nathan K started listening to the
[02:34:35] pod recently after a recommendation from a friend. Thank you very much and thank you to the friend. Really enjoying it.
[02:34:41] Question on ATI. Thanks and best wishes. Well, welcome Nathan ATI.
[02:34:48] Welcome to the foldy technologies.
[02:35:04] By the way, any of the ask me anything questions that we don't get to today?
[02:35:10] Uh, look, a lot of good things are happening. A lot of it's already priced in. Uh you might get some incremental
[02:35:16] gains out of this, but if we can't double or triple our money over a few years, we're not interested. And I don't think you're going to double or triple
[02:35:21] your money over this ever. So, uh hard pass. Uh Matthew from South Africa.
[02:35:29] Uh health equity.
[02:35:40] I think we covered this last week. Send in a ticker when you do this
[02:35:47] so we can save everyone's time
[02:35:54] HQ. As a rule of thumb, you want to avoid
[02:35:59] stocks that have Q in their tickers. Uh those of you, some of you will get
[02:36:05] that joke. Uh all right, cash flow is good.
[02:36:10] Revenues are good. HQY.
[02:36:22] Yeah, everything's good and everyone already knows it. It's up 5x off the
[02:36:28] lows or 4x three 4x off the lows. Uh
[02:36:33] yeah, look, you can you can buy it, but it's not going to get you a double or triple. So, for that reason, we're out.
[02:36:39] Brian buy we buy it when no one wants it right now. Everyone wants this. It could go a little higher. It's got some
[02:36:44] momentum. Tom, uh, got a question on this. Uh, Wendy's. No, don't like it.
[02:36:51] Uh, that we got the CEO who actually grew it 3x. Uh, he's now at Papa John's.
[02:36:58] Started listening. Loving the podcast. Take two. TTW. Welcome, Jeb McDonald.
[02:37:05] Uh, TTWO.
[02:37:11] You probably know more about this stock than I do because all your friends probably play video games in college
[02:37:17] instead of studying. But, uh, this one has already run. And it's not what we
[02:37:23] like to do. We like to buy it when no one wants it. If you had given this to me at $5 after down from 27, I'd be
[02:37:31] interested in maybe at 90 down from 210 214, but I doubt it. Uh, still negative
[02:37:37] free cash flow, trading near all-time highs. Uh, not for me. Revenues look
[02:37:42] pretty flat the last few years. So, no, the juice is out of that lemon, even if it goes a little higher.
[02:37:50] Next, Lachland Neo, GameStop.
[02:38:00] Going to reserve judgment and burden myself with the facts, but uh I'm going
[02:38:07] to say no.
[02:38:19] revenues continue to collapse. Free cash flow is starting to kick up.
[02:38:24] Um I I I don't I don't want to mess with this thing. I know they're trying to reinvent themselves, but do it on
[02:38:29] someone else's dime. Um next is Sunonny Chan.
[02:38:36] Thanks for all you do for the investors community. Keen to hear your thoughts on BU. Um, that's not one we've talked
[02:38:42] about publicly, but we do own in a number of accounts. Um, because that was a lagard after Baba had took taken off.
[02:38:50] Uh, no problem there. It's not as good as Baba, but it'll it'll play the China theme pretty well over time. Glenn Arid
[02:38:59] Ard Grimby, been a listener for a few years. Thank you. Uh, love listening to your podcast
[02:39:05] when I'm cutting down trees. Ferguson Enterprises. Okay, Ferguson.
[02:39:12] You must have some pretty good headphones to listen while you cut down trees. Uh, Ferguson Enterprises.
[02:39:26] Let's try the British version. We don't buy breakouts, guys. We buy things when
[02:39:31] they're down and out. So, um, I would suggest you watch a few of
[02:39:38] the video casts on YouTube because this is the antithesis of what we do. We buy things when they're down, not when
[02:39:44] they're up. I'm sure the fundamentals are fine and maybe you'll get a 20 30% move, but uh, that's what we do. Uh,
[02:39:50] Jimmy Jones asked, could you look at Fizer? We uh, we went to it in detail.
[02:39:56] That is a new holding um, in the last month. Katherine Paul
[02:40:04] wants to be. Yeah. No, we don't do guests unless you're worth a billion plus or we really really really like
[02:40:11] you. Uh Molina, uh or you're CEO of one of our holdings, Daniel Borman. Uh
[02:40:18] Molina, uh this has uh Medicaid risk.
[02:40:23] Um so we, you know, it's probably going to work, but we we can't predict what
[02:40:28] the policy is going to be, so we just stay away. Same with Centine. I think if you bought both of them and one went
[02:40:34] bankrupt, the other one's going to triple and you you do fine. So, if you had to play the Medicaid gamble, I would
[02:40:41] buy both of them and hope for the best. Uh, but that's not what we do here. Delivery Hero. This is from Theo
[02:40:47] Djardan.
[02:40:54] Is this a food service thing? I hate these businesses.
[02:40:59] I had a friend in Maitan and I was like, "Why would you ever do
[02:41:04] this?" But they did it anyway. Now they're out. Um,
[02:41:09] Dher because their analyst told them to do
[02:41:15] it. Um, all right. DH ER.
[02:41:25] This one looks like it's inflecting. That's kind of interesting. Uh, what do we got here?
[02:41:31] Online food ordering, quick commerce and delivery services. Look, I love the financials. I hate the business, so I'm
[02:41:37] going to pass. Um, Scott Wilson.
[02:41:46] Okay.
[02:41:52] MPW from Thomas Bar.
[02:42:04] Uh, this is a medical properties re.
[02:42:10] I don't like medical properties. They always seem to screw up a great business. Yeah, I I get
[02:42:18] it. This probably works, but I I don't want to be involved. You just don't There's always something
[02:42:24] lurking under the surface with those. Chris Williamson, happy holidays. Question is, Papa
[02:42:30] John's. We covered that and we own it. So, kudos on you. A lot of you have
[02:42:35] asked about it the last few weeks. We couldn't respond. Uh, great Thanksgiving.
[02:42:44] Yeah, Joe, just keep watching the podcast. You'll figure out what we're doing there. That's pretty straightforward.
[02:42:49] um Chinese military companies. JT, this is
[02:42:55] nonsense. Um about Baba military company. Trump is going to Beijing in
[02:43:01] April. They're going to have a beautiful deal. This is all posturing. When Xi tries to sloww walk them, we say, "We're
[02:43:08] going to put you on the military list." No one gives a if they're on the military list. They don't do business in the US. 10 cent is on the military list.
[02:43:15] No one gives a The stock's doing fine. So, it's just a waste of time nonsense to get you out of your stock.
[02:43:21] Uh, Strawberry, uh, love the show, Tom. You're a gem of a guy and a hell of an analyst. Alex Cole, he's probably
[02:43:27] British with that type of talk. Uh,
[02:43:32] Strawberry Fields, nursing home re. No, I don't I don't like these. I don't like healthcare reets. They just always have
[02:43:40] a tendency to blow up at the wrong time.
[02:43:49] Yeah, I'm going to pass. I mean, do your work. Underwrite each individual property. Maybe you can make it work, but the odds are against you. Anthony
[02:43:57] Ellerman, Domino's Pizza. I like the upside in Papa John's better. Domino's
[02:44:02] is a better business. Buffett says, "Buy great businesses at good prices." That's when he had hundreds of billions of
[02:44:09] dollars of permanent free float capital. Before that, when he was managing outside money, he bought good businesses
[02:44:15] at great prices and that's when he had the best performance of his career. We buy good businesses at great prices. Uh
[02:44:22] Domino's is a great business at a good price. Papa John's is a good business at a great price. We prefer good business
[02:44:27] at great price. Much more upside. We can make doubles in three plus years. And that's what we do uh at uh Hedge Fund
[02:44:34] Tips with Tom Hayes and for our clients at Great Hill Capital. Uh that's the goal. We are grateful for you being
[02:44:41] here. We'll be back next week live from California. In the meantime, make it a great one. Bye for now.
[02:45:22] Heat. Heat.
