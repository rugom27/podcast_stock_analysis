    "transcript_context": "comfortable with 3 1/2. And it's interesting postw World War II was the last time we have we had debt to GDP 120%. They did run inflation hot for the next half a decade. uh 3 to 5% and that brought down that aggressive growth and deregulatory policies brought down debt to GDP from 120% down to 63% by 1957. So maybe that's the playbook. Let it run a little hot, but let growth run hot. Let animal spirits come back. Uh make a favorable environment with interest rates. Companies can refinance. Companies can invest and uh and that would be a very positive thing. I'm curious to hear your view on cryptocurrency because amid some of the choppiness that we saw in November, at the same time, we had seen Bitcoin drop pretty dramatically. Now, of course, the past few days, it has shown signs of bouncing back. But do you see a correlation at all between the cryptocurrency market, Bitcoin in particular, and what's happening in equities? I I do think so because there's a lot of embedded leverage in both trades. It's kind of a risk on asset uh when animal spirits come back. Although, you did have this recent divergence. So people are like, \"What's going on? Was there deleveraging? Was someone blowing up?\" When people don't know, they get nervous. They shoot first, ask questions later. Um, you know, so it's it's a proky proxy for risk appetite. I I really won't say a lot more than that because it's outside of my lane. Uh, I just like buying great companies when they're on sale. Yeah. What else are you watching to that end? Well, I like two defensive Well, one's defensive, one's a little bit defensive dividend payers. One pays 7% yield, one pays 4.5% yield with tremendous upside potential in the price on top of it. First is Fizer. You can't give away Fizer. Uh they collected a lot of money during co that's now uh uh decelerated. It's only 14% of revenues, but they did the $10 billion Medsera deal, which is going to be a once a month uh GLP uh both uh shot and eventually oral, which would be an absolute gamecher. The CGEN deal is starting to bear fruit for oncology drugs. They've cut a tremendous amount of cost. There's activist involvement. Margins are reacelerating. Revenues are reacelerating. Uh trading just at eight times earnings and 7% yield while you wait. We love that on the dividend payer theme, on the healthcare theme, on the choppy midterm election year theme. It fits. It checks all the boxes. The second one is pizza. Papa John's. Okay. Turnaround story. The CEO came from Wendy's. While he was there under Nelson Peltz turning around the company threebagger under his toutelage he's now at Papa John's refinancing stores uh uh selling company stores all franchising model comp stores are now growing 2% ingredients are better everyone loves pizza and god forbid you get the Trump dividend if the Supreme Court votes against tariffs all that $2,000 is going to Papa John's pizza I'm telling you that right now Thomas hey joining me in studio he's chairman and managing member of Great Hill Capital Thomas thank you as Always. Thank you. All right, everyone. And we're back. And then I got to join the Big Money Show, which is a lot of"

The supply chain is not going to be disrupted and we are going to grow above trend just like we did post World War II. The last time we had debt to GDP at 120% we basically grew our way and inflated a little bit 3 to 5% inflation within by 1957 debt to GDP dropped to 63% from growth and letting the economy run hot like Larry Cuddlo always says let it rip.

He He's going to be like, \"We shall discuss this.\" Yeah. Yeah. The getting away with murder. That was figurative. Um we have yet to have a response from Amazon. But it is a scenario that is playing out across the country. And in many cases, city and county leaders say, \"You know what? The upside of these data centers is just too good to turn down, guys. Back to you, Ashley Webster. Appreciate it. Tom, do you agree? Is the upside too good to pass up or do you hear the the risks? I think the upside is too good to pass up, but you can't play the obvious plays. You have to pay play the derivative plays, the pick and shovels. Uh we've played this this year massively through comtock resources, natural gas play, cheapest, lowest cost producer of natural gas. That's going to drive the energy for for the data center boom. We played it through the least popular play which was Intel which happened to be the second best AI performer this year. Outperformed Nvidia this year. They make basic chips for data centers. Then you got GenerRack. They have the number one standby generator commercial generator backup power for these data centers which is absolutely critical. No one's even paying attention because they say, \"Oh, there weren't hurricanes in Florida. Therefore, sell Generrack.\" They're thinking about the home standby generators. They've got a half a billion dollar backlog just in data center backup demand. And then finally, you you take uh a simple company like Brad Jacobs, QXO, building supplies. All of these are going to need roofs. They're going to need building materials. And uh and this this game, this theme is just beginning. So don't play the obvious. The the data center uh vehicles are very very crowded. The obvious AI players are very very crowded, overvalued. Play the nonobvious players where you're going to see margin expansion. You're going to see revenue growth and you're going to see earnings go go really accelerate and the stock go up. Den, one thing that was we all know that stubborn inflation, a slowing job market and a fractured board of governors making America's fiscal future very uncertain. So, you hinted to that a little bit before, Tom. You believe that it was not some sort of a slip up, but that it was intentional.

Remember, we're still 100 basis points uh above inflation restrictive uh on policy. So, there's some room to cut and to really drive growth here. I'm not saying we need to go back down to zero. If we go down to zero, it's because the economy has collapsed. So, that's not where we're going to go. But, we got to go to neutral and let growth and animal spirits back into the picture. And uh and I think that's going to happen pretty quickly. Taylor, what say you about the wages? We're up 4.4% year-over-year. That's better than the overall average when we look at it. Right. A lot of that is, you know, for small businesses, their debt service has doubled in the last two years from Powell. And we're waiting for a massive refinancing wave, which I think we're going to start to see in 2026 because the market once you once you know it's the market's going to start to price that in. They'll be able to hit the market and they'll be able to go back into expansion mode versus survival mode with huge debt service payments. It's it's been uh very ownorous particularly on small caps which tend to be the most leveraged unfortunately. What do you think? Um we can't let China do it. We can't let Russia do it. Everybody wants to do it. But let's show the world how smart we truly are. And we are also the wealthiest nation in the world. So, put your money where your mouth is and get it done.

Look, it's it's it's going to be the new Persian Gulf over time in terms of minerals, in terms of helium, in terms of possibility of data centers and cooling and all the things. So, it is an aggressive race. It's better that we have two than one. Uh hopefully we have three or four, but um it's progress and uh and it's and it's good for the government to have multiple bids for sure.

So, as Mike said, I'm steeped in the value culture for sure. Uh we profit from buying on weakness and selling on strength. I know that's unpopular these days. People want to buy strength and sell more strength. Uh but our strategy is driven by deep research and the belief that the greater price dislocation reduces risk. Most people think when the price goes down, risk goes up. When you're buying a good business, when the price goes down, risk actually goes down. Okay. Okay, who agrees with that? Who disagrees? Okay, well maybe I can convert you over the next 14 minutes. Uh, so that's where we see opportunity. Our firm's philosophy is great investment opportunities come around when excellent companies are surrounded by unusual circumstances that cause the stock price to be misappraised. We're going to give you three of those ideas. So hang tight with us. Um, the podcast is Hedge Fund Tips with Tom Hayes. It is number one in the hedge fund category. It's been going on for six years. How many of my followers are here? We got a handful. All right. Super excited. I know a bunch of you said you were coming. So, uh, we look for one foot bars we can step over, not seven foot bars we have to jump. As you can tell, I've adopted a lot lot of Warren Buffett's philosophy. So in companies where the stock price is down a lot there are four key components. First of all we have to do solveny risk. If a stock has fallen 50 60 70% the market thinks they're in trouble. So first we look at balance sheet and cash flow and debt servicing. When we get comfortable with that we look at management. Is there a catalyst? Is there a change that's going to turn around the company's fortunes or in some case just just the company price? Because if you look under the surface, often times the free cash flow is just fine. What's the near-term catalyst? We don't want to be stuck in a value trap. We want to be in a company that can turn around quickly. And what is the competitive advantage of the company? Has the moat been permanently breached or is it temporarily impaired? These are some key things that differentiate great value investors from value investors. And it's a whole different world. So what's our edge? Every trade has a buyer and seller and both think they're right. Okay. So first and foremost is we play the time arbitrage game. Our average holding period is three to five years per position. So, we sit through the noise and people always joke Tom Hayes has ice in his veins because the short-term noise doesn't affect us. Why?"

Meanwhile, the MAG7 earnings engine is decelerating and set to converge with the other 493 by Q3 of this year, 2026, uh, positioning leadership to broaden. So, this dark blue line that's going down, that's Magnificent 7 earnings. The, um, the light blue, the aqua going up, that's the other 493 earnings. One group the earnings are going down, earnings growth is going down, the multiple is still high. The other group earnings growth is going up and the multiple is still low. What do you want to buy? The former or the latter? The coffee machine. No. Okay. All right. The ladder. Not only are MAG7 earnings slowing, but capex capital expenditures has jumped from 4% to 15% of revenue with aggressive balance sheet growers historically outperforming uh underperforming by 8.4% annually. So historically, the ones that are increasing capex massively underperform by 8 8.4%. with 60% of operating cash flow going to capex and free cash flow of the Mag 7 set to drop by 43% by Q1 of 2026. That's in just a year's time. The free cash flow of the Mag 7 has dropped by 43% and multiples are still expansion because of all the capex. We prefer the AI beneficiaries versus over the hyperscalers that are footing the bill. So the ones that can benefit from the technology versus the one that are picking up the tab. Does that make sense? Okay. So we see opportunities in healthcare, energy, and small caps for 2026. Healthcare is priced at panic levels with valuation curing many ills, pun intended. Energy offers a backdoor play on AI and the data center buildout is at a fraction of the price. Uh and small caps are entering an earnings up cycle with the Fed's wind at their backs. Small caps do very well in easing cycles. Policy and regulatory uncertainty has driven a mass exodus from the healthcare se uh sector with 17 billion dollars of year-to-ate outflows in healthcare, an annualized record, and fund managers cutting exposure to multi-year lows. This sector is now on track for a third straight year of underperformance with a cumulative 54 point lag, the worst stretch on record. Are you excited about healthcare? Okay, I'm going to explain why you might want to rethink that. Healthcare uh with investors shooting first and asking questions later, many high uh quality healthcare names have ended up on the clearance rack. We think these record low valuations cure a lot of ills and offer a rare chance to buy"

Two temporary headwinds still weigh on the stock, though both are fixable, and the market has simply lost patience. We love benefiting from others impatience. Okay. The stock market is a device for transferring wealth from the impatient investor to the patient investor. If you learn nothing else from me today, take that one home with you and think about it on the plane. Now, we see CEO Andrew Hitter as the next major catalyst for Baxter. most recently led ATS and automated solutions leader where he delivered a five bagger meaning you put in a million bucks you made 5 million bucks in six years. Before that he spent a decade at Danaher mastering the Danaher way which is a culture of executional discipline and continuous improvement that Baxter has been long overdue for as evidenced in their stock price. Right. Okay. Next. As Baxter proves it can return to four to 5% topline growth and near tame head near-term headwinds resolved, we see operating margins moving back to the high teens on a normalized earnings power of at least $3.50 per share and a return toward historical valuation levels. We think the stock can work back towards $60 over the next few years. This is an $18 stock, ladies and gentlemen. This is all opinion, not advice, but this is how we underwrite businesses internally and we're sharing that information with you. Is it valuable? Yes. Okay. Moving along.

The average car on the road is 14.5 years old. We think they're going to earn $10 a share this cycle. So, the question only is what multiple do you put on it?

The question is how many years of value are you already paying for today? We don't like to pay for that many years of value ahead. We like to get paid today. Uh and uh and we we operate in that conservative manner. But I I can't say like it's like asking me how high is bitco bitcoin gonna go. No idea. Wrong wrong wrong speaker. But uh the theme is I think we're mid to early innings of the gen generally the theme just as we were Amazon in 2000. The question is the price and for us we don't play in in the super high valuation areas. Yeah. Wonderful. Thank you. Thank you. And just And we're back. And then I was on a panel that was entitled keynote panel again in the main room. Uh 10 key stocks. Only Scott and I gave stocks. Uh so we cut it down to the ones you'll want to hear. We'll listen in here. Got it. Tom, I want to go to you. You've been patiently waiting here. We're talking, you know, as a value focused investor versus growth maybe versus some of the AI names. You had some sectors you were looking at earlier and some names. So what would you add to this discussion? Yeah, I think we're in a very bifurcated market. You have the concentrated stocks which uh I think you you run the larger risk. Okay, I definitely agree that we're in the roaring uh 20 2020s and the the story is just getting started, but uh outside of that, you could basically throw a dart at a board uh to Scott Martin's point and find a tremendous amount of opportunities to put money to work at reasonable valuations. And a theme at our firm at Great Hill Capital, uh we are looking to benefit from uh and and focus on and invest in the AI beneficiaries versus the AI cost centers, the companies that are going to uh increase margin as a result of implementation of the technology versus the ones that are absorbing all of the capex. Uh and I think to Scott's point, Scott uh Z's point is uh the earnings growth rate of the Mag 7 is actually aggressively decelerating and the cash flow uh generation is aggressively decelerating. So you you have a situation where you have uh expanded multiples in this tiny little area of the market uh with declining earnings growth and then you have the rest of the market that you could throw a dart at where the earnings growth is accelerating and is going to be parry pursu the growth rate with the this concentrated level but the multiple is meaningfully lower which is a point that uh Scott Z made uh so I think there's really unlimited opportunity uh one company I don't know if you want to go into companies yet that uh that is holding for us is GXO Logistics. This is a Brad Jacobs company. Does anyone know who Brad Jacobs is? Okay. Brad Jacobs has probably created more wealth for"

Uh we've built a a pretty sizable position here. Uh we think this can be a double over the next three years at least. Uh and uh and we're pretty sanguin about that. And that's one that you don't have to worry about being at nosebleleed levels. If they miss a quarter, the stock's down 50%. You're not going to find that with the GXL logistics with that leadership and with that opportunity with the reaceleration uh of the industry and the margin expansion. By the way, they use more robots in their picking in their warehouses than any other company there there is. So talk about AI and robotics and agentics and all of that. They are a leader in that and Brad Jacobs has done that throughout his career is he rolls up industries and then he implements technologies to double Ibida and he's doing the exact same thing at GXO. Well, Scott Martin since time we want to make sure you get your one or two, three, four questions in before uh we have to wrap this up. What? Oh, I'm sorry. I got I got one more. Um who was here two years ago or at the Money Show a couple years ago? Uh, okay, great. Quite a actually, no, a decent amount. Uh, I pitched a stock called Alibaba. It was quote uninvestable. It was China. Uh, it's now up triple. Uh, the options we did are up 7x. I've got a new one for you and it's going to make you want to get a, you know, one of those airplane bags exactly the way you got an airplane bag two years ago with Alibaba. It's called PayPal. Okay. Stock's down 80% from its COVID highs. Uh it's generating record- free cash flow. No one's paying attention. They generate six to7 billion. Oh, and by the way, they're buying back 10% of the company every single year. They're uh um they have record users, 438 million. They they fired all their nonprofitable customers. Alex Chris came from in it where he ran the small business unit. This was one of our catalysts this morning, a new jockey. uh it was a 38 bagger while he was running that division into it stock. So now he's applying those. They brought over the guy from Amazon who started the whole ad business on Amazon. They're doing that uh on on PayPal. Uh Venmo's now got 100 million users. It's like the Kleenex of peer-to-peer uh thing. Buy now pay later is growing at 20% and you can't give the stock away. $67 billion of free cash flow. I mean, it's just a cash machine. It's reacelerating. Margins are expanding. Revenue is expanding. No one's paying attention. This is exactly what was happening with Baba two years ago when everyone said, \"China, China's uninvestable.\" PayPal, that's yesterday's news. I'm telling you, we'll come back in two years. This stock is going to be $60 now. It probably be 120 to 150. And people will just be starting to pay attention to it. The sell side will just be putting out their buy by buy ratings at 130 saying it's going to 150. And if you were here at the money show, you'll have a little"

It's so virtual you're not even gonna be able to see it. Uh little bit about my background. Not everyone was here yesterday uh or saw saw me in the morning. Uh Great Hill Capital is my firm. We manage money for um high net worth individuals, for family offices, and for institutions. Um, prior to that, I was at a firm called Cornwall Capital Management. Uh, any of you see The Big Short, the movie? Uh, the, um, I worked for the gentleman played by Brad Pitt. His name was Ben Rickett in the movie, Ben Hockett in real life, uh, probably four times as smart as, uh, Brad Pitt, uh, and 1/4 as handsome in real life. Uh, but super guy. I still talk to him to this day. I learned a lot about derivatives uh at Cornwall. Uh they were great and s guys. Prior to that, uh I was at a firm called Bedford Oak Advisors.

So uh we're predominantly concentrated long only 8 to 12 stocks uh makes up 85 to 90% of the portfolio. 10 to 15% of the portfolio we use for derivative overlay in English uh you know that that means we'll do longdated options on core positions and we or spreads uh and we also use that bucket for hedging from time to time if we think the market is excessively overvalued but our core positions are not at fully valued and we don't want to realize profits before full maturity uh we'll use that bucket to dampen volatility uh sometimes times put spreads on the indices on individual names or sectors. So that's um that's how we do that. But I I think I referenced yesterday when we were talking about BABA, it's like yeah, the stocks up 3x off the bottom, but the options we did uh we closed out at 6 to 7x. So that adds a lot of alpha even if they're one and two% position. So that's what we like to do for clients. Um the philosophy of the firm comes straight from Warren Buffett both both in what we believe and and what we charge. Uh we don't charge a management fee which is very unusual. So, we get paid zero until the account goes up. And then when the account goes up, we get a percentage of the profits based on the size of the account. And then uh to get paid again, we have to earn back 100% of what we were paid uh which is what we call a high watermark uh before we get paid again. So, very few people do that. Uh I'd love to take credit for it, but I just copied what Warren did when he was running his partnerships. Uh and the philosophy is that great investment opportunities come around when excellent companies are surrounded by unusual circumstances that cause the stock to be misappraised. So uh how many of you were here a couple years ago when I was really pounding the table on Baba? Yeah, a few of you. So you know, excellent is uh in the eye of the beholder. You know, some people think excellent is some company's going to change the future, but they're losing a billion dollars a year. Um, we like to bet on sure things. At the time, uh, Alibaba had $80 billion of cash on its balance sheet. It was generating $25 billion of free cash flow uh, and growing and you could not give the stock away because of all the noise about uninvestable, about China and all of that stuff. Um, the other thing that we do that people find pretty valuable is Hedge Fund Tips with Tom Hayes is the number one ranked uh podcast in the hedge fund category by FeedSpot.

Uh, they also have the possibility of an oral GLP1. And if they're the ones to do it, it is game over, lights out. Now, that's all speculative. We're not worried about that. We're That's just the cherry on the Sunday. What are we talking about here? CGEN, four new uh oncology drugs. They've cut a tremendous amount of costs. People are worried about the patent cliff for Eloquis and some of the other drugs. They're take they've taken $7.2 billion of costs out of the business. They're paying a dividend of 7% while you wait. It's trading at eight times forward earnings. And guess what's been happening in the last couple years? Cheap. It's cheap.

And what's interesting, this is a composite going back 98 years, and it looks exactly like what we've seen in this particular presidential cycle, which implies kind of a sideways consolidation move after a big move. Um, with the weakness culminating around September of 2026. Um, and you can see here the Aqua is the past 10 cycles since 1985. The average returns for the S&P are 2.2 and percent. And if you go back since 1950, the average returns are 4.6%. That's from U. Ryan Dietrich over at Carson, by the way. So, as we move into a midterm year, political noise tends to creep into the markets, making these years the weakest of the four-year cycle. Since 1950, they've averaged 4.6% 6% versus 11% in other years, by the way. That's meaningful underperformance. And the past 10 cycles have been weaker at just 2.2% with stocks usually remaining under pressure until late September. Midterm volatility pays off. Uh midterm years tend to see the largest intrayear pullback and it averages 17.5%. Is anyone looking forward to a 17.5% pullback next year? No. Uh I am actually more sanguin than most uh next year. And the reason is uh you tend to get a you don't you don't 10 the average is you get a 20% correction every 3.5 years. We have had three 20% corrections in the last 5 years. So it effectively if if the long-term average means anything we've pulled forward 10 years of 20% corrections in the last five years. That's why I think uh next year might be more modest in terms of volatility than than history would suggest. But I think it would be natural to get a 10% pullback because you get one of those every 13 months on average and it always feels like the world is ending. Uh midterm years are volatile, tend to deliver the largest draw downs, uh averaging 17.5 compared with other years which average 12.3% in the other three years. Yet those sell-offs have consistently been buying opportunities with stocks never lower one year after the midterm low and up 31.7% on average going back to 1950.

So here's another visual. defensive sectors market cap weight uh relative to uh in the S&P 500 has fallen to lows not seen in over 25 years since 2000. And if you remember 2000 was a very concentrated techdriven market. Defensive have had a very low waiting. You saw what happened next. defensives waiting went up dramatically as demand for them increased materially and the Fed began easing. So def defensive sectors sit at their lowest S&P weight on record and trade at the valuation discounts last seen in the early 2000s which preceded a multi-year stretch of outperformance. We expect defensives to catch a bid as volatility rises, having outperformed cyclicals by 7% in seven of the past eight midterm cycles leading into the elections. So 7% outperformance by defensives in a midterm election year. Is that meaningful? So if you follow the crowd, you're likely to have, if history is any forecaster, underperformance and probably some pain. If you go against the crowd right now, you can't give away defensive stocks and you can't give away staples. Uh you have a chance to do exceptionally well next year. And buying really businesses that are so durable and have been around for so long and you can sleep like a baby at night. You don't have to predict who's going to cure cancer. You don't have to predict who's going to win the AI race. You don't have to have a crystal ball. All you have to know is people are going to brush their teeth. They're going to drink alcohol. They're going to uh um"

Uh, to offset this pressure, management has launched a cost savings plan targeting 7.2 2 billion in net savings in 2027 while reinvesting $500 million to strengthen R&D productivity. Management is on track to deliver 4.5 billion of savings by year end supporting the goal of restoring Fizer's operating margins to their preandemic high 20% range. Margin expansion is the name of the game for rerating a stock. Rerating just means multiple expansion re reaceleration. Fiser enters the patent cycles from a stronger base than peers with no product above 12% of sales. The market is overly pessimistic and missing the 7.2 billion right sizing effort and the pipeline and deals aimed at countering the patent pressure. Together, these offsets give Fizer a clear and credible path to navigate the cycle and restore margins. Yeah. the president $30 million a year. Yeah. Well, his stock goes down. Um, you know, that that is something we do keep an eye on. It's um compensation to management. Uh, it's in line. Does he deserve that much money? It's a pretty big company, so it's kind of a rounding error. But, uh, to your point, maybe this guy doesn't, maybe the next guy does. We'll see. Uh after Fizer's homegrown obesity programs flopped and the company appeared out of the race, the 10 billion Metera acquisition provides the missing piece, a differentiated once monthly GLP1 platform in a rapidly growing hundred billion dollar market. Early data is promising with products potentially hitting the market by 2028 and delivering 5 billion plus in peak annual sales once a month versus, you know, more regular and also oral optionality as well. If you could get an oral pill, you know, it changed the world. Uh the four $43 billion CGEN deal added four approved cancer drugs and a leading ADC pipeline that Fiser believes can grow from 2 billion in annual sales at purchase to more than 10 billion by 2030, strengthening the oncology growth engine as legacy drugs approach expiration. Fiser's pipeline and recent deals are materially underappreciated with Metser's once monthly GLP1 platform and the 43 billion CGEN deal driving the next leg of growth together with Arena Biohaven GBT and others. These assets should add $25 billion in 2030 revenue, offset expirations, and set up a path toward greater than $80 billion in non-COVID sales by 2030. valuation yields set the floor. Fiser trades at just eight times forward earnings, a steep discount to the mid- teens industry average, making it one of the cheapest large cap farmer names to own.

They sound like they're commercial. Better ingredients, better pizza. Sorry. Listen, uh, comp store sales up 2% and by the way, you get a 4.5% dividend yield while you wait. Why am I so keen on the dividend? Because in a, uh, dividend payers as a whole and defensives, uh, are the most undervalued that they've been in 25 years, uh, as rates recompress, all that money, $7 trillion of money markets is going to be forced into the market.

    "transcript_context": "revenue growth over our forecast period with low capital requirements and massive operating leverage. Much of that growth should flow to the bottom line and support long-term compounding. So they got rid of the fiber business which was kind of a drag on investment. Uh and the second thing that they did was uh ju just a couple things on mobile data. Demand has grown by more than 30% annually for the past three years. Most people wouldn't guess that uh and is projected to compound at 15% through 2030. This sustained growth requires ongoing carrier investment to support higher traffic. And with 5G still in its early 20-year cycle, long run demand for tower infrastructure remains strong. So, Crown Castle's removed the two biggest overhangs, devesting the value destructive fiber segment and placing proven industry veteran Chris Hildebrand in the CEO role, which we view as a key catalyst to the turnaround. Together, these moves create a higher margin pure play tower operator that can return capital to shareholders on a massive scale through buybacks, through dividends, etc. They invested $19 billion into the fiber with poor returns. They sold the segment for 8.5 billion. They will use the proceeds to delever the balance sheet and fund buybacks, making CCI a leaner, higher margin tower company with a very nice dividend. Uh leadership had been a revolving door. Hildebrandt is an industry veteran with more than three decades of telecom experience. rate relief ahead. Like REITs, like all REITs, CCI trades on interest rates and the 348 basis points rise in the 10-year from late 2021 to 2023 drove a nearly 60% draw down in the stock. Falling yields will unlock cheaper financing, lower interest rate burden for companies like CCI, which carries 24 billion in net debt and nearly 1 billion in annual interest expense. While the dividend remains neglected today, we expect CCI's 4.5% yield with total shareholder yield above 6% to become far more attractive as rates move lower and sideline capital is pushed back into yield. CCI is a pure play on the rate easing cycle with lower rates cutting interest costs, improving refinancing terms, strengthening tenant activity, and drawing investors back to dividend payers with total shareholder yield above 6% and a 50% price upside by our estimates. CCI stands out as a highquality name in a volatile midterm year. By the way, as always, this is all opinion, not advice. Consult with your psychic before doing anything. Yeah. going down. Yeah. A lot of the speakers this week have been talking about how evenffect."

Hold your peace. in your fund and what the lock uh million dollars and no lock up quarterly liquidity full transparency is a hedge fun uh we run it as separately managed accounts through interactive brokers so you own the account you can technically log in every day and see what's in your account uh full transparency full liquidity no no no lockup great capital is the management company it's an LLC there's no pass no there's no pass because you you own account, whether it's in your name or in your IRA or in a corporation or trust. Uh you'll set it up with Interactive Brokers. All we do is manage it. We have uh investing privileges only. Um if you want to take money out, you just log into your account and take money out. Yeah. And what what is your fee on like a million dollar portfolio? Are you invested in a thousand stocks or No, we we run a concentrated portfolio of 8 to 12 stocks. um that makes up 85 to 90% of the portfolio. 10% is a derivative overlay for excess returns on the core positions and also hedging to dampen volatility when we think the market's overvalued. Uh the per performance fee ranges from 25% down to 15% depending on the size of the account. And then there's also something we call a high watermark. So not only do we not get paid until your account goes up, we don't get paid again until we earn back 100% of what we got paid. Um, so, um, it's, you know, I set it up that way. One, I copied Buffett when he was running his partnerships, and two, it's the only deal that I would accept on the other side of the table. I wouldn't want people getting paid whether my account went up or down. I want them getting paid when it goes up. So, pay out or what's that? How long did you get paid? Well, the the Interactive Brokers looks at it quarterly and it just looks back infinite quarters to see what is the highest level that the account has ever closed at. And if it's above the highest level the account has ever closed at, it's the split whether it's 8020 to the client uh or or less or more depending on the size of the account and you would get paid through a separate uh payment outside the account. No, it's it's done within the account. Yeah, it's a retirement account."

Go ahead. You ever play an ETF or just model? No, because you can't really do derivatives, right? And um the reason we run in separate, this is a key point. I'm glad you brought it up. The reason we run in separately managed accounts versus a co-mingled fund is because we want to put new clients in those stocks that we believe are just leaving the station versus the stocks that are up 50 60 70% in the last 6 or 12 months. So we, you know, cuz if if we put them in the ones like in a co-mingled fund, you're forced into everything that's already gone up a lot. Whereas with separately managed accounts, I can put them in the eight or 12 that that I think are just getting ready to take off. And that has a huge impact on IRRa because, you know, I could put them in Alibaba at 160 when everyone else has a 70 or $80 basis, but the move from 70 to 160. Um, you know, as it goes from 160 to 320, the IRRa is not as aggressive versus if they had that low basis. So that's that's not one that we would aggressively put a brand new one in because it's already made half of its move. We want to put them in the horses of the world and the things that are just getting going. Yeah. Yeah. What is your minimum investment? It's a million bucks. 1 million. Yeah. Yeah.

Papa John's baby this is a new one. People are going to go crazy for this. So uh consumer discretionary managers cut it by the most in history. That sector uh people are down on the consumer. Consumer sentiment is low. I'm telling you the consumer is doing well. They've got a new CEO that was from Wendy's. He ran Wendy's when Nelson Peltz was turning around the company. Three Bagger during his tenure from 2016 to 2024. They are refin uh refranchising uh 85 units in the UK that were company owned. Getting rid of all the company owned. That doesn't work. They're a cap cap uh capex light business cuz it's all franchising fees. Uh better ingredients comp store sales. They sound like they're commercial. Better ingredients, better pizza. Sorry. Listen, uh, comp store sales up 2% and by the way, you get a 4.5% dividend yield while you wait. Why am I so keen on the dividend? Because in a, uh, dividend payers as a whole and defensives, uh, are the most undervalued that they've been in 25 years, uh, as rates recompress, all that money, $7 trillion of money markets is going to be forced into the market. What are they looking for? They're looking for yield. Your downside is protected with these inexpensive stocks. Your upside is is meaningful. Uh you get paid while you wait. And I love a good turnaround story. As you know, you do. I'm more convinced on Fizer. I'm a I'm still I'm going to do this for We sent out almost a hundred gift cards to our clients. Every year we send them something from one of our portfolio holdings. All these wealthy guy guys and gals are eating Papa John's for the holidays. Last year I sent them van shoes for VF court. Okay. And uh it's going to be a good year for Papa John's. And what happens if you do get those tariff dividend checks? If the Supreme Court votes against tariffs and he pays that out, where does all that go? It goes straight into consumer discretionary. They're going to be buying vans from Brack and Daryl over court. They're going to be buying Papa John's like it's going out of business. All right, we'll have to leave a we'll have to bookmark our conversation for Tom. Tom, I always enjoy talking to you. Wonderful D. Yes. I love it. That's Tom Hayes, managing member at Grey Hill Capital and chairman over there. And we're back. Then I had the pleasure right after to join uh Kristen Scher who's just phenomenal. Uh and uh covered in a little different twist. Uh terrific information here. Thanks to Kristen and Mel Montana. We'll listen in here. And joining me now with more is Thomas Hayes. He's chairman and managing member at Grey Hill Capital. Thomas, great to see you. Great to be back. Thanks, Kristen. Uh, good to talk in early December. Historically, a strong month for stocks. What do you see in the markets right now? I think we have gotten through the worst of it. You know, normally when you have those 15% intraear corrections, uh, and then you rally to all-time highs. The secondary correction is 6.5%. That's"

There's so much thing there's no such thing as a value company. Price is all that matters. At some price, an asset is a buy. at another it's a hold and at another it's a sell. And finally, uh, two new inductees into our hedge fun tips community, Albert and Joanne and Robert. Awesome job. Awesome meeting you down there. Keep the photos coming in coming in, ladies and gentlemen. Um, and uh, appreciate you guys being generous and unselfish and uh, and getting that over. Appreciate the orders. you know, if you're not comfortable, uh, we we just put your first initial of your last name, but, uh, it's very much appreciated. All right, let's get down to data. LG exports to hit monthly record. Cppler data shows we love that, Mr. Comtock Resources Fed put is alive and well. You can see when the odds of a hike went, excuse me, when the odds of a cut went up, the market rebounded for the follow-through I covered on Vney this morning. You'll see that next week when Ze is done with it. Um, we talked about the only thing that could screw up strength into end of year would be Jay Powell if he uh shocks the market with a hold versus a cut uh when 90% is baked in. I don't think he will. He gets to go out like Seinfeld if he does it right at the top of his game. And um and that would bode well for year end uh strength. uh small caps being the strongest during this time of year starting on the 15th of the month and going through March. Uh number of IPOs has been picking up year-to- date on track for the best year since 2014. Very good to see. Uh here is US commodity price index versus total relative return. Uh inflation sensitive stock index. So um commodity index has that come down and oil the index has come down. It looks like it's at or near an inflection uh which we agree. Fed set to shift from large seller of treasuries to one of the largest buyers in 2026. That will help the long end of the curve. That'll help real estate. That will help a lot of our plays levered to interest rates along with the Fed following through with another few cuts. quantitative tightening and September 2019 was the start of a 17% rally in equities. Uh so that's what we're seeing and we'll see if we get a similar type of situation. Four of four times December is positive. Small cap ETF inflow starting to rip, ladies and gentlemen. But if you look out on the longer term, that's the rolling 65 days. If you look over the one year, it looks like it's bottoming out just like it did in uh 2020 before rip roaring rally.

Number of public companies fell precipitously marking a bull case for stocks. You see the uh because there's no supply. That supply is going to change. You've heard rumblings. There was an article this morning about Open AI and some of the others needing to go public to retain talent. that game will just get started. That should help the banks. If we can find a period where we get weakness again, we would be a buyer. Uh you're going to benefit from that. Even buying uh small caps because you'll have exposure to regional banks at the very least, which is levered to that. Uh tech sector versus midcap stocks. You can see this divergence always closes and I think the real economy is going to rip. That's going to be the theme in 2026. Healthc care sector waiting in the S&P 500. You can see the lowest since 2000 and then going back to 1994. Both preceded multi-year historic long rallies which is why we wanted to supplement Baxter with Fizer uh along with the um uh remaining XBI basket of biotech which has just been on a complete rip roaring rally. US faces impending power crisis. uh peak supply needed, peak supply anticipated. That's where Generrack and Comtock come in. Deep down discounts Europe versus US 12-month forward price to earnings ratio. Uh the biggest discount is consumer discretionary and energy uh in Europe relative to the US. So there's some opportunities there. Tech capex as a percentage of the S&P 500 higher than the peak in 2000. Equities typically rise following midterm elections. We covered that with Stu. You tend to get some weakness in the pre uh uh midterm election years."

And what happens if you do get those tariff dividend checks? If the Supreme Court votes against tariffs and he pays that out, where does all that go? It goes straight into consumer discretionary. They're going to be buying vans from Brack and Daryl over court. They're going to be buying Papa John's like it's going out of business. All right, we'll have to leave a we'll have to bookmark our conversation for Tom. Tom, I always enjoy talking to you. Wonderful D. Yes. I love it. That's Tom Hayes, managing member at Grey Hill Capital and chairman over there. And we're back. Then I had the pleasure right after to join uh Kristen Scher who's just phenomenal. Uh and uh covered in a little different twist. Uh terrific information here. Thanks to Kristen and Mel Montana. We'll listen in here. And joining me now with more is Thomas Hayes. He's chairman and managing member at Grey Hill Capital. Thomas, great to see you. Great to be back. Thanks, Kristen. Uh, good to talk in early December. Historically, a strong month for stocks. What do you see in the markets right now? I think we have gotten through the worst of it. You know, normally when you have those 15% intraear corrections, uh, and then you rally to all-time highs. The secondary correction is 6.5%. That's exactly what we got. So, the only thing that could mess this up if is if we get a surprise next week with the Fed. It doesn't look like that. Even after the the jobs numbers this morning, uh 88% chance of a cut. If that's the case, you've got quantitative tightening ended uh in December, which uh usually precedes the beginning of uh some level of quantitative easing. We'll see what happens there. Uh we've had 316 global central banks cutting this year, which is even more than the great financial crisis. Very tough to fight that liquidity, double-digit earnings growth. So that's all the good news, rainbows and unicorns. What's the bad news? The bad news is midterm election years tend to be the worst year of the 4-year presidential cycle. Uh S&P 500 up on average 2.4% only. Average correction in a midterm election year 17.3%. Uh I don't think we're going to get that though. Do you know why? On average uh every 3.5 years you get a 20% correction. We've had three of those in the last 5 years. I think we've pulled forward a lot of that 10 years worth of 20% corrections. So, I think a more modest uh 10% pullbacks is normal every 13 months. Uh but there is one particular group, Kristen, that while the S&P underperforms 2.4% tends to outperform at 9% in and that is that is healthare. Healthcare. Yeah. Which you couldn't give away. You couldn't give away healthcare for the last three years. Lowest weight in the S&P in years. lowest relative PE relative to the S&P 500 in 25 years. It had uh lowest relative valuation hasn't been this hated since 2000, the last time we had this level of concentration in the top 10 stocks and for the next 5 6 7 years healthcare dramatically"

While great weather is a win for almost everyone, when your core product only sell when the lights go out, sunshine can be a gut punch to demand. Q3 delivered the lowest outage hours since 2015, running 75 to 80% below the long-term average. All against a tough comp from last year's three major storms and the highest outage quarter since 2012. Tough setup, zero help from mother nature, entirely predictable outcome. When mother nature is your business partner, these lumpy quarters are unavoidable. They can cut both ways. We have zero to do with management exe. They have zero to do with management execution and are simply table stakes in backup power. Always have been, always will be. Zoom out.

And and by the way, they keep buying in 10% of the company every year with their $7 billion of free cash flow. So, you know, after a handful of years, each slice is going to be so big without putting new money anyway, even if they don't execute, but they are executing. So, that's why we continue to buy more.

Uh, if you had new money, do you have any new horses to unleash? Well, we covered two today. Uh, Crown Castle, Orl, Dagio, Baxter, would you bet your last dime on them. I'd never bet my last dime on anything. I I own a basket of them uh with 98% of my net worth right alongside clients. So uh along with the others that have been up huge. So I think these are going to be the winners in 2026. Um and by the way, don't ask six questions in one email, please, because that's uh not allowing enough time for other people to ask questions. Uh Bristol Meyers uh it's not for us, but um we like Fizer, but thank you. Thank you so much for finally sending in a question, Bob. I hope that was helpful. Joe"
