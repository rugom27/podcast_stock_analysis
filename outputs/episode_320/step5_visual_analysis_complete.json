So we've had average every 3.5 years. We've had three of those in the last 5 years. I think we've pulled forward a lot of that 10 years worth of 20% corrections.

Uh, number one, they just did the Metsera deal for $10 billion, which has a monthly GLP1, so you don't have to do it uh every week or or whatever is the normal case. Uh, they also have the possibility of an oral GLP1. And if they're the ones to do it, it is game over, lights out. Now, that's all speculative. We're not worried about that.

You know, normally when you have those 15% intraear corrections, uh, and then you rally to all-time highs. The secondary correction is 6.5%. That's exactly what we got. So, the only thing that could mess this up if is if we get a surprise next week with the Fed. It doesn't look like that. Even after the the jobs numbers this morning, uh 88% chance of a cut. If that's the case, you've got quantitative tightening ended uh in December, which uh usually precedes the beginning of uh some level of quantitative easing. We'll see what happens there. Uh we've had 316 global central banks cutting this year, which is even more than the great financial crisis. Very tough to fight that liquidity, double-digit earnings growth. So that's all the good news, rainbows and unicorns. What's the bad news? The bad news is midterm election years tend to be the worst year of the 4-year presidential cycle. Uh S&P 500 up on average 2.4% only. Average correction in a midterm election year 17.3%. Uh I don't think we're going to get that though. Do you know why? On average uh every 3.5 years you get a 20% correction. We've had three of those in the last 5 years. I think we've pulled forward a lot of that 10 years worth of 20% corrections.

They did run inflation hot for the next half a decade. uh 3 to 5% and that brought down that aggressive growth and deregulatory policies brought down debt to GDP from 120% down to 63% by 1957. So maybe that's the playbook. Let it run a little hot, but let growth run hot. Let animal spirits come back. Uh make a favorable environment with interest rates. Companies can refinance. Companies can invest and uh and that would be a very positive thing. I'm curious to hear your view on cryptocurrency because amid some of the choppiness that we saw in November, at the same time, we had seen Bitcoin drop pretty dramatically. Now, of course, the past few days, it has shown signs of bouncing back. But do you see a correlation at all between the cryptocurrency market, Bitcoin in particular, and what's happening in equities? I I do think so because there's a lot of embedded leverage in both trades. It's kind of a risk on asset uh when animal spirits come back. Although, you did have this recent divergence. So people are like, \"What's going on? Was there deleveraging? Was someone blowing up?\" When people don't know, they get nervous. They shoot first, ask questions later. Um, you know, so it's it's a proky proxy for risk appetite. I I really won't say a lot more than that because it's outside of my lane. Uh, I just like buying great companies when they're on sale. Yeah. What else are you watching to that end? Well, I like two defensive Well, one's defensive, one's a little bit defensive dividend payers. One pays 7% yield, one pays 4.5% yield with tremendous upside potential in the price on top of it. First is Fizer. You can't give away Fizer. Uh they collected a lot of money during co that's now uh uh decelerated. It's only 14% of revenues, but they did the $10 billion Medsera deal, which is going to be a once a month uh GLP uh both uh shot and eventually oral, which would be an absolute gamecher. The CGEN deal is starting to bear fruit for oncology drugs. They've cut a tremendous amount of cost. There's activist involvement. Margins are reacelerating. Revenues are reacelerating. Uh trading just at eight times earnings and 7% yield while you wait. We love that on the dividend payer theme, on the healthcare theme, on the choppy midterm election year theme. It fits. It checks all the boxes. The second one is pizza. Papa John's. Okay. Turnaround story. The CEO came from Wendy's. While he was there under Nelson Peltz turning around the company threebagger under his toutelage he's now at Papa John's refinancing stores uh uh selling company stores all franchising model comp stores are now growing 2% ingredients are better everyone loves pizza and god forbid you get the Trump dividend if the Supreme Court votes against tariffs all that $2,000 is going to Papa John's pizza I'm telling you that right now Thomas hey joining me in studio he's chairman and managing member of Great Hill Capital Thomas thank you as Always.

A couple of points there that Tom makes, Brian. Um I like this idea of lower rates if it's warranted based on the data. But then when you start talking about operation twist y and other engineering, I'm starting to think back to 2008 after the crisis. We took interest rates down to zero. We were expanding the balance sheet. I I I don't actually like all of that massaging to make it work. I think the pieces should come together a little bit more naturally. So you let's have transparent targets. Here's what we're going to do. Actually invite more public comment, right? but narrow the mandate of the Fed down, which I think everybody can agree.

So, as Mike said, I'm steeped in the value culture for sure. Uh we profit from buying on weakness and selling on strength. I know that's unpopular these days. People want to buy strength and sell more strength. Uh but our strategy is driven by deep research and the belief that the greater price dislocation reduces risk. Most people think when the price goes down, risk goes up. When you're buying a good business, when the price goes down, risk actually goes down. Okay. Okay, who agrees with that? Who disagrees? Okay, well maybe I can convert you over the next 14 minutes. Uh, so that's where we see opportunity. Our firm's philosophy is great investment opportunities come around when excellent companies are surrounded by unusual circumstances that cause the stock price to be misappraised. We're going to give you three of those ideas. So hang tight with us. Um, the podcast is Hedge Fund Tips with Tom Hayes. It is number one in the hedge fund category. It's been going on for six years.

So in companies where the stock price is down a lot there are four key components. First of all we have to do solveny risk. If a stock has fallen 50 60 70% the market thinks they're in trouble. So first we look at balance sheet and cash flow and debt servicing. When we get comfortable with that we look at management. Is there a catalyst? Is there a change that's going to turn around the company's fortunes or in some case just just the company price? Because if you look under the surface, often times the free cash flow is just fine. What's the near-term catalyst? We don't want to be stuck in a value trap. We want to be in a company that can turn around quickly. And what is the competitive advantage of the company? Has the moat been permanently breached or is it temporarily impaired? These are some key things that differentiate great value investors from value investors. And it's a whole different world. So what's our edge? Every trade has a buyer and seller and both think they're right. Okay. So first and foremost is we play the time arbitrage game. Our average holding period is three to five years per position. So, we sit through the noise and people always joke Tom Hayes has ice in his veins because the short-term noise doesn't affect us.

The speaker notes that the earnings growth of the MAG7 is decelerating, while the earnings growth of the other 493 is increasing. He suggests that this divergence presents an investment opportunity in the latter group, as their earnings growth is rising while their multiples remain low, contrasting with the MAG7's high multiples despite slowing earnings growth. The speaker also mentions that the MAG7's capital expenditures have increased significantly, which historically leads to underperformance.",

Meanwhile, the MAG7 earnings engine is decelerating and set to converge with the other 493 by Q3 of this year, 2026, uh, positioning leadership to broaden. So, this dark blue line that's going down, that's Magnificent 7 earnings. The, um, the light blue, the aqua going up, that's the other 493 earnings. One group the earnings are going down, earnings growth is going down, the multiple is still high. The other group earnings growth is going up and the multiple is still low. What do you want to buy? The former or the latter? The coffee machine. No. Okay. All right. The ladder. Not only are MAG7 earnings slowing, but capex capital expenditures has jumped from 4% to 15% of revenue with aggressive balance sheet growers historically outperforming uh underperforming by 8.4% annually. So historically, the ones that are increasing capex massively underperform by 8 8.4%. with 60% of operating cash flow going to capex and free cash flow of the Mag 7 set to drop by 43% by Q1 of 2026. That's in just a year's time. The free cash flow of the Mag 7 has dropped by 43% and multiples are still expansion because of all the capex. We prefer the AI beneficiaries versus over the hyperscalers that are footing the bill. So the ones that can benefit from the technology versus the one that are picking up the tab. Does that make sense? Okay. So we see opportunities in healthcare, energy, and small caps for 2026. Healthcare is priced at panic levels with valuation curing many ills, pun intended. Energy offers a backdoor play on AI and the data center buildout is at a fraction of the price. Uh and small caps are entering an earnings up cycle with the Fed's wind at their backs. Small caps do very well in easing cycles. Policy and regulatory uncertainty has driven a mass exodus from the healthcare se uh sector with 17 billion dollars of year-to-ate outflows in healthcare, an annualized record, and fund managers cutting exposure to multi-year lows. This sector is now on track for a third straight year of underperformance with a cumulative 54 point lag, the worst stretch on record. Are you excited about healthcare? Okay, I'm going to explain why you might want to rethink that. Healthcare uh with investors shooting first and asking questions later, many high uh quality healthcare names have ended up on the clearance rack.

He does an incredible job and he's going to be working uh nonstop uh in the next uh uh few weeks. We are going full boore here. We got a lot of exciting stuff going on and um so if you ever get a chance to meet him, thank him for all the hard work that goes on behind the scenes. Uh we're going to listen in here at a more normalized pace with questions and uh really going through each idea. Here we go. Uh, yesterday we had 33 slides to get through in 15 minutes. Uh, today we have 28 slides to get through in 45 minutes. So, we've got plenty of time to talk. We can take questions uh throughout. If you need to ask questions throughout, that's fine. But I think we'll open it up at the end for 10 or 15 minutes for questions. Um, but if anything is really nagging you as we go through this, please feel free to uh to raise your hand and and we'll get this done. if you remember that from from school days. Uh what what was it? Morehouse Muenberg. Muenberg. There you go. Uh so we're moving into an ele midterm election year. There is one gentleman in here that has a sense of what that could mean. Uh anyone else uh have an idea of what happens in midterm election years in the stock market generally? All right. Yeah, that's right. That's right. Good. You will get the free virtual prize. It's so virtual you're not even gonna be able to see it. Uh little bit about my background. Not everyone was here yesterday uh or saw saw me in the morning. Uh Great Hill Capital is my firm. We manage money for um high net worth individuals, for family offices, and for institutions. Um, prior to that, I was at a firm called Cornwall Capital Management. Uh, any of you see The Big Short, the movie? Uh, the, um, I worked for the gentleman played by Brad Pitt. His name was Ben Rickett in the movie, Ben Hockett in real life, uh, probably four times as smart as, uh, Brad Pitt, uh, and 1/4 as handsome in real life. Uh, but super guy. I still talk to him to this day. I learned a lot about derivatives uh at Cornwall. Uh they were great and s guys. Prior to that, uh I was at a firm called Bedford Oak Advisors. Uh the principal was friends with Warren Buffett for 40 some odd years. So I kind of got steeped in the value methodology early on. Uh go"

So uh we're predominantly concentrated long only 8 to 12 stocks uh makes up 85 to 90% of the portfolio. 10 to 15% of the portfolio we use for derivative overlay in English uh you know that that means we'll do longdated options on core positions and we or spreads uh and we also use that bucket for hedging from time to time if we think the market is excessively overvalued but our core positions are not at fully valued and we don't want to realize profits before full maturity uh we'll use that bucket to dampen volatility uh sometimes times put spreads on the indices on individual names or sectors. So that's um that's how we do that. But I I think I referenced yesterday when we were talking about BABA, it's like yeah, the stocks up 3x off the bottom, but the options we did uh we closed out at 6 to 7x. So that adds a lot of alpha even if they're one and two% position. So that's what we like to do for clients. Um the philosophy of the firm comes straight from Warren Buffett both both in what we believe and and what we charge. Uh we don't charge a management fee which is very unusual. So, we get paid zero until the account goes up. And then when the account goes up, we get a percentage of the profits based on the size of the account. And then uh to get paid again, we have to earn back 100% of what we were paid uh which is what we call a high watermark uh before we get paid again. So, very few people do that. Uh I'd love to take credit for it, but I just copied what Warren did when he was running his partnerships. Uh and the philosophy is that great investment opportunities come around when excellent companies are surrounded by unusual circumstances that cause the stock to be misappraised. So uh how many of you were here a couple years ago when I was really pounding the table on Baba? Yeah, a few of you. So you know, excellent is uh in the eye of the beholder. You know, some people think excellent is some company's going to change the future, but they're losing a billion dollars a year. Um, we like to bet on sure things. At the time, uh, Alibaba had $80 billion of cash on its balance sheet. It was generating $25 billion of free cash flow uh, and growing and you could not give the stock away because of all the noise about uninvestable, about China and all of that stuff. Um, the other thing that we do that people find pretty valuable is Hedge Fund Tips with Tom Hayes is the number one ranked uh podcast in the hedge fund category by FeedSpot. Uh, you can find that on YouTube. Uh, how many of you um have listened to one of my podcasts or more? Okay, handful of you. That's great. Um, do you listen or watch? Watch. You watch it.

Um, with the weakness culminating around September of 2026. Um, and you can see here the Aqua is the past 10 cycles since 1985. The average returns for the S&P are 2.2 and percent. And if you go back since 1950, the average returns are 4.6%. That's from U. Ryan Dietrich over at Carson, by the way. So, as we move into a midterm year, political noise tends to creep into the markets, making these years the weakest of the four-year cycle. Since 1950, they've averaged 4.6% 6% versus 11% in other years, by the way. That's meaningful underperformance. And the past 10 cycles have been weaker at just 2.2% with stocks usually remaining under pressure until late September. Midterm volatility pays off.

So if there's ever a year to own health care relative to the other four years in the presidential cycle, the second year of the cycle is it. Healthcare has beaten the S&P 500 in 11 of the last 13 midterm years, delivering 9.03% 03% returns on average versus 62 basis points for the S&P 500 with record outflows, its worst three-year relative stretch on on record. Multi-year low exposure and valuations at historic discounts, healthc care stands out as one of the most attractive sectors for 2026. Volatility also sets up consumer staples. Um you can see in the Bank of America fund manager survey they have their lowest exposure to Staples before the great financial crisis and that quickly changed once volatility picked up. Sentiment around Staples is washed out with exposure sitting about one standard deviation below its historical average and the group's relative ratio to the S&P 500 at a record low with only 5% of staples outperforming over the past 6 months. one of the weakest readings in 50 years. We think rising volatility sets the stage for a rotation. So most people say, \"Well, healthcare is not performing anymore. I don't I want to avoid that.\" We see that and we say healthcare is not going away if there was ever a time to buy it. You know, I always joke Wall Street is the only place in the only market in the world when they throw a clearance sale, everyone runs out of the store. I mean, you can't make this stuff up. Black Friday, they're waiting outside tackling each other for a clearance sale on a big screen TV. Wall Street, you get a clearance sale, they run out of they run out of the building.

Margin expansion is the name of the game for rerating a stock. Rerating just means multiple expansion re reaceleration. Fiser enters the patent cycles from a stronger base than peers with no product above 12% of sales. The market is overly pessimistic and missing the 7.2 billion right sizing effort and the pipeline and deals aimed at countering the patent pressure.

Much of that growth should flow to the bottom line and support long-term compounding. So they got rid of the fiber business which was kind of a drag on investment. Uh and the second thing that they did was uh ju just a couple things on mobile data. Demand has grown by more than 30% annually for the past three years. Most people wouldn't guess that uh and is projected to compound at 15% through 2030. This sustained growth requires ongoing carrier investment to support higher traffic. And with 5G still in its early 20-year cycle, long run demand for tower infrastructure remains strong. So, Crown Castle's removed the two biggest overhangs, devesting the value destructive fiber segment and placing proven industry veteran Chris Hildebrand in the CEO role, which we view as a key catalyst to the turnaround. Together, these moves create a higher margin pure play tower operator that can return capital to shareholders on a massive scale through buybacks, through dividends, etc. They invested $19 billion into the fiber with poor returns. They sold the segment for 8.5 billion. They will use the proceeds to delever the balance sheet and fund buybacks, making CCI a leaner, higher margin tower company with a very nice dividend. Uh leadership had been a revolving door. Hildebrandt is an industry veteran with more than three decades of telecom experience. rate relief ahead. Like REITs, like all REITs, CCI trades on interest rates and the 348 basis points rise in the 10-year from late 2021 to 2023 drove a nearly 60% draw down in the stock. Falling yields will unlock cheaper financing, lower interest rate burden for companies like CCI, which carries 24 billion in net debt and nearly 1 billion in annual interest expense. While the dividend remains neglected today, we expect CCI's 4.5% yield with total shareholder yield above 6% to become far more attractive as rates move lower and sideline capital is pushed back into yield. CCI is a pure play on the rate easing cycle with lower rates cutting interest costs, improving refinancing terms, strengthening tenant activity, and drawing investors back to dividend payers with total shareholder yield above 6% and a 50% price upside by our estimates. CCI stands out as a highquality name in a volatile midterm year. By the way, as always, this is all opinion, not advice. Consult with your psychic before doing anything. Yeah. going down. Yeah.

The reason we run in separately managed accounts versus a co-mingled fund is because we want to put new clients in those stocks that we believe are just leaving the station versus the stocks that are up 50 60 70% in the last 6 or 12 months. So we, you know, cuz if if we put them in the ones like in a co-mingled fund, you're forced into everything that's already gone up a lot. Whereas with separately managed accounts, I can put them in the eight or 12 that that I think are just getting ready to take off. And that has a huge impact on IRRa because, you know, I could put them in Alibaba at 160 when everyone else has a 70 or $80 basis, but the move from 70 to 160. Um, you know, as it goes from 160 to 320, the IRRa is not as aggressive versus if they had that low basis. So that's that's not one that we would aggressively put a brand new one in because it's already made half of its move. We want to put them in the horses of the world and the things that are just getting going. Yeah. Yeah. What is your minimum investment? It's a million bucks. 1 million. Yeah. Yeah.

You can see this divergence always closes and I think the real economy is going to rip. That's going to be the theme in 2026. Healthc care sector waiting in the S&P 500. You can see the lowest since 2000 and then going back to 1994. Both preceded multi-year historic long rallies which is why we wanted to supplement Baxter with Fizer uh along with the um uh remaining XBI basket of biotech which has just been on a complete rip roaring rally. US faces impending power crisis. uh peak supply needed, peak supply anticipated. That's where Generrack and Comtock come in. Deep down discounts Europe versus US 12-month forward price to earnings ratio. Uh the biggest discount is consumer discretionary and energy uh in Europe relative to the US. So there's some opportunities there. Tech capex as a percentage of the S&P 500 higher than the peak in 2000. Equities typically rise following midterm elections. We covered that with Stu. You tend to get some weakness in the pre uh uh midterm election years."

Uh and then the second group is financials earnings revised up 2.89% uh in the last 60 days. So that's positive to see. Let's see if we can get this article back online. Okay, looking at data, the ISM manufacturing came in a little bit of weaker. Manufacturing prices came in a little weaker on Monday. Uh ADP non-farm payroll came in much weaker than expected. So now the only hurdle to guaranteeing uh continuing claims and initial jobless claims were lower than expected. So that's um showing some strength. Uh GDP now still at 3.8%. So the big thing is tomorrow this core PC price index provided this is not egregiously over 3% uh or egregiously over.3% expectations are 0.2% month-on-month 2.9% year-onear we will get the cut. I mean if this came in at 3536 uh that might be a little jarring uh for the market but um it should be okay should be okay based on the other stuff we look at. All right, now let's get on to the ask me anything questions and then I'm going to get on a flight. Here we go. Uh, Marcel Bala, chemical stock, company stocks are are very cheap right now. Do you think this will turn around and the sector will become profitable again? Never. We are never going to use chemicals again ever in our life. It's over. They're all going to zero. I would stay away. I'm kidding. Of course, they're going to come back. You just got to pick the right ones that can withstand if the cycle takes longer than you expect. Diane Stiller, could you give me your thoughts on DXY for 2026? Lower over time. No change there. Gasper Mohoric question about PayPal. Yeah, this is the exact type of questions that we got on Baba. What if this time is different? Blah blah blah. Bottom line, free cash flow is going up, earnings are going up, revenues are going up, margins are going up. No one wants the stock. It's trading at half its historic multiple with reaceleration, 100 million active users on Venmo, uh 1.7 billion, 438 uh globally, uh largest P2P system, buy now pay later growing. They brought in the ad guy from Amazon Web Services. Uh the business is hitting on all cylinders. Al Alex Chris is doing what he needs to do and this thing will be back. And and by the way, they keep buying in 10% of the company every year with their $7 billion of free cash flow. So, you know, after a handful of years, each slice is going to be so big without putting new money anyway, even if they don't execute, but they are executing. So, that's why we continue to buy more. I wish it would just go down to 49 to get rid of all the whiny little"
