business\n\nfinally\n\n### MISCELLANEOUS\nfinally\n\nmy golf swing is actually come back I&#39;m striking the ball really well uh do booking a lot of 41s and 43s but just not putting them together yet for two times in a row but uh back in the right gear and pretty excited I think I&#39;m going to dial that in and get it done before the end of the year want to thank uh now on to the media want to thank Preston Melle Christian dagger and Stuart vanney for having me on vanney and Company on Friday we talked about Intel which is a very controversial stock right now we&#39;re not going to go into a lot of it because there&#39;s going to be a board meeting midt there are activists circling around this stock and once we identify who they are and their track recorded turnarounds we&#39;re going to ride that train uh and they&#39;re selling off mobile ey they they just announced thank God what took you know took them long enough uh they won&#39;t do the Germany Factory which is perfectly fine we care about the US factories and um you know and they&#39;re swirling about getting rid of Ginger I I&#39;m kind of I&#39;m not really in that camp yet I know everyone wants to blame Ginger but uh let&#39;s see what happens in the next few weeks it&#39;s trading at tangible book what does that mean in English if they were to liquidate the company today in other words they&#39;re attributing no value for the organic growth of the business and we spent 3 hours explaining why that was a a false narrative uh but um that creates the opportunity to buy down here which we took advantage of uh so uh let&#39;s tune into Stu premarket action on a Friday morning right before a long holiday weekend solid gain for the NASDAQ look at that up 166 points that is 86% Tom hay is back with us to look at the markets this morning all right margins uh profits and profit margins have been good this earning season does that mean the rally continues I think the theme Here stew is stay alive till 2025 what do I mean by that the music&#39;s playing right now we&#39;re going to dance until that first cut which is usually historically a buy the rumor sell the news so we might get a little choppiness before the election that&#39;s also in line with election year seasonality since World War II so if you&#39;re on margin if you&#39;re on Leverage come off margin and leverage uh stay invested enjoy the volatility in October and will get a year-end rally once we know that uh gridlock is in regardless of which party wins the executive branch we just want to see gridlock the less politicians can do the better for the stock market you love some gridlock when you always does well for the market that&#39;s true now you got two stocks that you like I want to start with gener the generate of people 70% of the market the stock is down 70% from its covid highs why they over inventoried because they thought they couldn&#39;t get parts they worked through that inventory it troughed in the fourth quarter of last year it&#39;s reacel ating it&#39;s up off off the lows of $780 it&#39;s up to 155 we think this can go much higher this was a $500 stock they&#39;ll be generating similar cash flows within the next 12 to 24 months that they were at their Peak interest rates lowering is going to help this because people Finance the per purchases and we&#39;ve got hurricane season right around the corner so that&#39;s good for Gen 70% of the market yeah and the grid ain&#39;t doing too well is it so nice to have a gen in the backyard you got it exactly okay the other one is Intel I noticed that it&#39;s got to 21 I say this every day in it&#39;s got to $21 a share or it&#39;s reached 20 is it a buy it is a buy you know it&#39;s G down a lot it&#39;s trading a tangible book okay the government has back stopped this they need Intel&#39;s Foundry to succeed to compete with Taiwan semiconductor so they&#39;ve given them money they&#39;re going to stand behind The Foundry and they announced today they might separate The Foundry business they&#39;re going to be activists around this stock they&#39;ve hired someone to defend against activists which means stuff is going to start to happen so they&#39;ve got their legacy business the aipc business they&#39;re going to ship 40 million still a leader in that business and the gouty 3 competes with the Nvidia 100 chip it&#39;s half the price for twice the performance 40% more energy efficient so if you think Nvidia is going to have a monopoly on this think again we&#39;ve gone through the semiconductor cycle sooner or later it becomes a commodity product Intel is going to be able to compete and chip away at Nvidia going to get back to 30 or 35 I think over the next 12 to 24 months this stock can get not only to 30 I think the Legacy business excluding the promise of GP pus I think their legacy business alone is worth $40 a share okay well take a look at it Tom thanks for being here appreciate it and we&#39;re back and then I had the pleasure of joining uh Sean calebs on cgtn America thanks to Sean and T gabron for having me on we&#39;ll listen in here okay lot to unpack talking about the US economy and for that we turn to Thomas Hayes he is the founder chairman and managing member of great Hill Capital at Equity management company based in New York Thomas great to have you on I certainly appreciate it and a lot as I mentioned to get to overall the report very encouraging want to get your take away from it uh American consumers obviously spending do they have the money uh what about this latest data what are the bright spots and what areas if any do you think are out there for a concern well the good news Sean is that when the US consumer has a job they spend money you never want to bet against the US consumer what we are seeing in terms of mixed results is companies like Dollar General that cater to lower income consumers are really getting hurt that stock had its biggest one-day drop I believe ever today wow uh because the lower-end consumer is struggling a little bit little bit you&#39;re seeing with the fast lower and fast food restaurants in the value Wars trying to offer lower and lower prices for those consumers that are hurting the most and then at the upper ends you saw Best Buy today have one of its best days ever because more and more people people are buying AI PCS and refreshing their PC Cycles so it&#39;s A Tale of Two Cities but on balance we saw with that GDP number things are generally okay let&#39;s talk a bit more about The Tale of Two Cities because anytime you have a wealth Gap that&#39;s obviously a reason uh for concern what about the do-it-yourself operations Home Depot entities such as that because frequently when times are tough people will try to do it themselves rather than hire out a contractor do we see anything like that yeah I think these will do well they&#39;re kind of insulated their businesses are broad enough but what&#39;s really going to benefit the Home Depot and the Lowe&#39;s of the world uh and even some of the companies that are suppliers there like the Stanley Black and Deckers the gener is lower interest rates that is going to reignite housing that&#39;s going to reignite projects that&#39;s going to reignite construction that is a big deal that&#39;s coming to a theater near you the FED is going to start cutting in September and they are going to be one of the initial immediate beneficiaries well for all those folks out there who do work construction that&#39;s great news for them let&#39;s talk about the data for the labor markets as well clean energy jobs doing well but what&#39;s the overall state of the labor market right now especially given other recent information that shows the US economy simply did not add as many jobs any kind of jobs good jobs or or or however you want to classify it as previous readings yeah that was a big shocker for a lot of people the 800 18,000 downward revision over the year uh what we&#39;re finding though is the Fed has a dual mandate and they&#39;ve now shifted their focus uh they were exclusively F I would say exclusively F focused on inflation they have now shifted and what&#39;s caused them to move is their concerns about the labor market the initial jobless claims that Karina mentioned while it came in better than they are elevated and the FED has their eye on it and that&#39;s why they&#39;re going to go in September because that is a lot harder to recover once it starts falling apart okay we also know wages have coming up in in the past year or so but the price of groceries has gone up 21% the price overall of of goods about 19% but still the economy has been boosted by this consumer spending it comes as a surprise given the prices that I just talked about so what is driving consumers uh is this their confidence out there that we&#39;re going to turn the corner I think there&#39;s something to to that that number one they have jobs number two they are deleveraged if you look at The deleveraging Debt Service as a percentage of disposable income uh it&#39;s really fallen off of a cliff since 2009 it&#39;s come down and down and down the moral of the story is people have a lot less debt they have a lot more cash and albeit t\n\nthe FED is going to start cutting in September and they are going to be one of the initial immediate beneficiaries well for all those folks out there who do work construction that&#39;s great news for them let&#39;s talk about the data for the labor markets as well clean energy jobs doing

deleveraging Debt Service as a percentage of disposable income uh it&#39;s really fallen off of a cliff since 2009 it&#39;s come down and down and down the moral of the story is people have a lot less debt they have a lot more cash and albeit there is  a demographic at the lower end that&#39;s starting to struggle and we&#39;re seeing default Spike up and auto loans and things like that by and large 80 some OD perc of the population is doing generally okay but a little bit worried and that&#39;s why the FED is taking a move they don&#39;t want to see layoff start uh there had been some data out two weeks ago that the unemployment rate if you back out the immigration could be as potentially as low as 3.6 3.7% uh it&#39;s the immigration that has uh caused the 4.3% print as of present you know we really can&#39;t talk about all this new data with without talking about the upcoming US election ### MISCELLANEOUS\nKLA Harris has made it clear she really wants to Target price couging uh Donald Trump has been looking overseas uh wants more tariffs especially on China uh coming in what are your thoughts on the US race what are people looking at to distinguish themselves from an economic standpoint from these two candidates well look the name of the game is as as it relates to stock markets and generally the economy is everyone does better when there&#39;s gridlock I.E no one power has no one party has too much power so uh as it relates to uh taxing unrealized capital gains that&#39;s a bad idea if I was going to write a book called How to cause a Great Depression the first chapter one would be entitled let&#39;s start taxing unrealized Capital but isn&#39;t that some but hang on a second isn&#39;t that taken out of context to a degree because as I understand it it&#39;s just aimed at people who have $100 million or more yeah and the people that have $100 million or more are the people who invest in companies that create jobs and if you take away their incentive to invest in companies you&#39;re going to have a lot less jobs so I don&#39;t think that will get through Congress so I don&#39;t think that&#39;s a material thing uh as it relates to Trump on the other hand uh threatening tariffs he did the same thing in his first term what we saw was that Chinese relations uh certainly Chinese stocks did a lot better under the Trump Administration than they did under the Biden Administration uh they actually had one of their worst crashes ever under the Biden Administration so I think the jury is out often times if you make bets based on politic I you lose everyone thought energy stocks would do well under Trump they underperformed they did well under Biden everyone thought solar stocks would go to zero under Trump they actually did quite well they did poorly under Biden so I wouldn&#39;t make your bets on uh politics I would make your bets on the fact that earnings continue to grow estimates are up fif for plus 15% for next year so on balance as long as we have checks and balances and one party does not win all three branches we&#39;re going to be just okay okay Thomas Hayes good stuff is always we can&#39;t thank you enough we appreciate it thank you Sean and we&#39;re back and then\n\n### MEDIA_APPEARANCE_RECAP\nrelations uh certainly Chinese stocks did a lot better under the Trump Administration than they did under the Biden Administration uh they actually had one of their worst crashes ever under the Biden Administration so I think the jury is out often times if you make bets based on politic I you lose everyone

we have checks and balances and one party does not win all three branches we&#39;re going to be just okay okay\n### MEDIA_APPEARANCE_RECAP\nI think we&#39;re setting up very close to a situation like 2001 to 2007 where where Tech underperformed we&#39;re not going to crash like we did back then because we they actually have earnings power but underperformed and uh some of these groups outperform as the dollar [Music] weakend hello and welcome to our latest money show Money Masters podcast segment Mike Larson editor-in Chief at money show 2024 has been a strong year for the stock market we&#39;re seeing a lot more volatility in August and September today we have a huge list of potential Market catalysts right around the corner that includes the first likely Federal Reserve interest rate cut in four plus years and of course the upcoming presidential election joining me to cut through the Clutter and give you some actional opinions about what is likely to happen is Tom Hayes Tom is founder chairman and managing member of great Hill Capital as well as the man behind the informative and entertaining Market commentary site hedge fund tips Tom how are you I&#39;m doing great good to good to be with you Mike yeah I&#39;m glad to have you here I mean gez a lot going on in the market so I guess I kind of have to start with the most obvious question right is September going to be one of those moments where we all want to run and hide or do you think this seasonally weak period for markets talk is a littleit overblown you know it&#39;s interesting uh when everyone&#39;s looking for correction is when you usually don&#39;t get it you know we we&#39;ve been of the view that it could get a little choppy in late September and early October I think the I think the potential surprise here Mike uh is that the jobs report should come in in a fashion on Friday that will cement the FED doing obviously the 25 basis points and maybe 50 basis points but more likely 25 no matter how bad the jobs report is on Friday and we&#39;ve got two coincident factors number one is the election year seasonality if you look back to World War II uh it tends to actually be markets tend to be strong into mid September not September 1st midt uh that doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s going to work uh exactly that way this year but the other thing that we notice is when a Fed starts the easing cycle the first cut has a high propensity to be a buy the rumor sell the news so our base case is actually that we start to see some strength into that first cut so you know maybe yesterday and today being a oneoff uh the short-term volatility we get the jobs report people start to look forward to the cut and maybe we even touch you know we did with the Dow or relook at near New highs on the S&amp;P and then we move into that normal pre-election Jitters from late September through the end of October which will be an opportunity to buy into a yearend rally uh that is fostered by a hopeful gridlock outcome irrespective of who&#39;s elected not having one power with absolute one party with absolute control is the key for the stock market got it got it well let&#39;s talk a little bit about the the fed and kind of the economic news I mean as we&#39;re speaking we just got a pretty lousy looking jolts report you know we won&#39;t have the NFP by the time this this airs um but we&#39;ve seen some some squishier softer numbers not terribly recessionary in my opinion uh of late so how do you think that you know the FED reacts what do you see them doing again in September and maybe as we roll into the final couple of meetings here in 2024 yeah I I you know Jay Powell has a history of not liking to shock markets I think he learned that early on in December of 2018 when he said autopilot and by Christmas Eve everyone was wondering if uh the stock market was going to fall through the floor it fell something like 19% like overnight uh I was at Disneyland looking at my cell phone like what the hell is he doing uh and fortunately uh minutian stepped in and got the banks together and and recovered everything so since then he tends to avoid major surprises and um in that on that basis I think he&#39;s going to do 25 even if the jobs report is weak and from there uh we could see uh the Market&#39;s pricing in a 100 this year I don&#39;t know you know that would kind of concern me in the sense that if they do a 50 cut maybe the economy is a little worse than everyone expects maybe it&#39;s not a soft Landing so base case is actually uh more conservative 50 to 75 I think 75 probably gets done 25 2525 uh and then we see where it is uh in you know 2025 got it you know one of the things obviously I follow your work at hedge fund tips it&#39;s fantastic everybody who&#39;s watching this please make sure you sign up for some of that commentary because it&#39;s very insightful and enjoyable one thing I know you&#39;ve been talking about there and elsew\n\n### MACRO_DATA_SLIDES\nnot having one power with absolute one party with absolute control is the key for the stock market got it got it well let&#39;s talk a little bit about the the fed and kind of the

make sure you sign up for some of that commentary because it&#39;s very insightful and enjoyable one thing I know you&#39;ve been talking about there and elsewhere is  the rotation that we&#39;ve seen in this market for the last couple of months right I mean it was an alltech all the time market for a while since July that&#39;s been changing what do you think&#39;s going on there and what do you think that means going forward I think it&#39;s very very healthy the market is broadening out and it&#39;s not just some hope like we&#39;ve had some fake outs in the past this time it&#39;s actually uh backstopped and substantiated by the trends in earnings you know you had the Magnificent Seven earnings growth in the first quarter of this year was 50% uh that&#39;s dropping down to 18 to 20% by by fourth quarter of this year uh and year on year it&#39;ll go from 30% this year to 18% next year at the same time the unmagnify in the first half of this year had negative earnings growth so when people say well why are only seven stocks performing because only seven stocks have meaningful enough earnings growth to perform that is changing that&#39;s now inflecting to positive earnings growth and that&#39;s why you&#39;re starting to see the broadening that&#39;s why you&#39;re starting to see the movement under the surface small caps for instance uh expected to grow 7% earnings growth this year how about 37% earnings growth next year and that is also in line with the first six and 12 months after a f fed cut value outperforms growth in the first six month and small caps outperform large caps by over 11 percentage points in the first 12 months after the first cut from the Federal Reserve that&#39;s some great insights there and I wanted to ask you you know while we&#39;re on that subject within sort of the the small cap space or some of the non-tech sectors is what looks particularly attractive to you I mean is it financials is it industrial something else that you&#39;re watching it&#39;s across the board you know we specialize in turnarounds my nickname is kind of turnaround Tom uh you know one company that&#39;s not a small cap it&#39;s not a dividend pair you know the groups that tend to outperform after the first cut uh we&#39;ve got a weakening dollar we got lower rates so that means uh Emerging Market should do better it means small cap should do better it means dividend payers should do better uh and and it means value should do better and I think one of the stocks that has become a value stock is called uh that we own is called PayPal and and we own it lower from from these levels it&#39;s had a recent move but we think just getting started and the name of the game t\n\nthat&#39;s dropping down to 18 to 20% by by fourth quarter of this year uh and year on year it&#39;ll go from 30% this year to 18% next year at the same time the unmagnify in the first half of this year had negative earnings growth so when people say well why are only seven

it&#39;s had a recent move but we think just getting started and the name of the game t\n### MISCELLANEOUS\n\nmargins are reaccelerating and you know he came in and cleared the deck he&#39;s he&#39;s uh uh barely coming on one year and um you know he he basically took took expectations down he said we&#39;re going to do five billion of free cash for we&#39;ll buy back five billion of stock well he just came out this quarter and he said you know that five billion I I I got that wrong we&#39;re actually going to generate billion of free cash flow this year and we&#39;re going to buy $6 billion worth of stock then you got this other business called venmo which is basically the kleenex of peer-to-peer payments that&#39;s growing like a weed they&#39;ve got a a a venmo for teens that&#39;s growing like a weed and there&#39;s a lot to do there so it&#39;s really just the beginning so some of these Fallen Angels uh are really a tremendous opportunity here I I love you brought up the turnaround Tom nickname I&#39;m going to get to that in a second towards the end but I wanted to ask first uh you know you&#39;ve you&#39;ve been a proponent of some looking outside of us borders at some of the cheaper stocks you can find around the world even in a place like China which had fallen out of favor for a long time are we at the point where that you know those types of markets are going to play catchup here if so why and what would you do about it yeah so uh two two things uh 100% dollars weakening yields are coming down that is a magic formula for Emerging Markets I think we&#39;re setting up very close to a situation like 2001 to 2007 where where Tech underperformed we&#39;re not going to crash like we did back then because we they actually have earnings power but underperformed and uh some of these groups outperform as the dollar weakend so uh China we want exposure and look we&#39;ve been bagged in this Alibaba for a year and a half it&#39;s been dead money completely done nothing but uh I think the time is now and alibaba&#39;s proxy for emerging markets but more than that a proxy for China it&#39;s the national champion and something very important just happened the shareholders voted on August 22nd to approve a dual primary listing in Hong Kong that enables it to join the southbound connect on September 9th what does that mean it means for the first time ever mainland China investors and there are 220 million of them they anticipate about 180 million as a potential Market to buy Alibaba stock uh will be able to buy Alibaba stock for the first time ever starting September 9th what&#39;s more important than that is that alibaba&#39;s got about 80 billion dollars of cash on their balance sheet and rather than they couldn&#39;t get that cash out of China to do buyback so they would have to issue non-dilutive convertible uh stock uh in order to get US dollars to buy the stock back back even though they had $80 billion sitting at home they will now be able to buy back stock through the southbound connect and you see just in the last few days since that dual primary listing was approved uh that they&#39;re reporting how much stock that they&#39;re buying back and we&#39;re going to see that accelerate so I think look uh you know everyone feels that China&#39;s uninvestable but if you look at the Hang sang for the last 20 years you have these huge Corrections every two to four years and uh the bigger the correction the longer it takes usually takes about two years to build the base but when it turns and it starts to move up it tends to be parabolic and you know you got to keep in mind through all the noise the country is still growing at 5% GDP and and here we are American exceptionalism no question about it but we&#39;re growing at two and a half percent. so there&#39;s opportunity there they will recover and I think demographically speaking they&#39;ve got another huge parabolic run before maybe they do run out of time three to five years out like Japan did in the late 80s because they didn&#39;t make enough babies for for so long but for now they&#39;ve got a huge portion of their population age 34 and their spending should should increase and uh Peak out at around age 40 got it Tom uh you&#39;re gonna be joining us for the 24 money Show Master Symposium in Sarasota this December um you know we talked about this sort of turnaround approach I just want to know when it comes to methodology why do you find that style of investing so attractive and what do you think people were looking look to be value investors or turnaround investors need to know when it comes to pointers or advice well number one uh a stock that falls 90% can fall another 50% before you get a five bagger so so it&#39;s uh uh there&#39;s something to be said there but what we like is we&#39;re we&#39;re not predict the next great thing people we are buying durable business that have been down around through many cycles and have have had multiple turnaround situations and have proven they have a durable Mo so even when the stock&#39;s down 60 or 80% or whatever it happens to be when we&#39;re getting involved we we&#39;re looking and we&#39;re seeing okay well the free cash flow and the revenues are kind of holding in there or in some cases they might might be down modestly they&#39;re not down 80% that I can assure you uh revenues are usually flat are growing and uh and free cash flow is usually positive and then you get some Catalyst with a new CEO that has talent to take this beautiful Legacy franchise that has been through multiple cycle Cycles over decades and turn it turn it back into something great and we like it because uh the margin of safety is much greater once we have comfort with the balance sheet Etc that we can make a double or triple in a handful of years versus uh business that&#39;s already up quite a bit you know we we had talked about uh you may have caught our note in uh June of this year when we said envidia was the new pain trade you can look it up on the website it was like June 22nd that day uh it opened at 136 it went up to 140 against us and has since Fallen about 30 40% uh because you know it&#39;s a great business but at $3.2 trillion valuation when you have a a total GDP of 28 trillion and an expected growth rate from the sell side of 40% a year what they&#39;re basically trying to convince you is that it&#39;s going to be half of GDP in four years which is absolutely makes no sense if you&#39;re interested and believe in something called math so um you know so those are the type of things that we avoid and uh and and other things that we can have a sense of certainty two three years out we can make a double or triple if it&#39;s a smaller business sometimes we can make a multibagger got it got it well just one last question I guess um you know beyond what we&#39;ve talked about here any other sneak peek or uh you know tidbits about what you think you might be talking about in Sarasota I know December&#39;s still a few months off so it&#39;s a little bit tough who knows what the market will do between now and then all I can tell you is in the unmagnify there are tremendous opportunities still that have been created by once in a 100y year event called covid and these are durable multi-decade franchises so we&#39;re going to talk about a few of our ideas for 2025 we&#39;re very excited about that we&#39;re going to talk about our General Market Outlook and we&#39;re gonna have a lot of fun well Tom listen thank you so much for your advice and your insights here viewers if you&#39;re watching and you want to learn more from Tom he is going to be joining us at that money Show Master and osum in Sarasota it runs December 5th to 7th at the Hiatt regeny Sarasota here in sunny Southwest Florida if you&#39;ve been to this part of the country uh in December you know how great the weather is going to be it&#39;s going to be a wonderful time uh enjoy the outside enjoy the knowledge you&#39;re going to get inside and learn from experts like Tom so uh click the link below look at the description if you need some more details and Tom I look forward to seeing you there in a couple of months thanks Mike and one finals Tom caveat opinion not advice thanks so much for having me got it sounds good take care Tom [Music] bye-bye [Music] and I want to go through couple of things now that we&#39;ve uh as many of you have been following us uh we bought a lot of uh Amazon in October of uh 2022 and then again in March of uh 2023 that has more than double we took off a uh the majority of the position in uh July as we talked about on the podcast and we&#39;ve taken off the rest of the position uh in um in the last week so you know Blended out of the thing somewhere around 190 and we got in down here so that&#39;s more than a double in a year and a half and some of these things uh you know they like like this one only took you know B basically a year and a half some of these work really really fast and others work more slowly and that&#39;s the name of the game well let&#39;s to look at anothers that we harvested we talked that we had sold out of uh um uh Bank of America I mean this was nearly a double off the lows uh and we took off the final 25% around 40 so Blended you know 401 two three range uh and that&#39;s not quite a double from the lows but that was a good trade and then city were fully out of uh this was a monster lows were 36 in change um uh we had some in the 30s some in the low 40s and um took off most of that and took off the rest this week at you know in the around 60 so that was close to a double and again these are this one was less than a year or or just a little bit over a year rather and you know whether it&#39;s so you just see over and over the framework works sometimes it takes longer sometimes okay now Google is one that we took off the majority of the position again in July perfectly timed right after we put that article out on Nvidia where we said uh the next pain trade and we had the picture of Jensen Wong signing some fans uh breast with his signature and and the stock that day opened at 136 went to 139 it since collapsed close to 100 it&#39;s bouncing around the bottom um so we got R out of most of Google at that we we still have that 25 30% tiny small stub in Google we&#39;re not going to sell Down in the Hole here but on the next strength up to 170 180 maybe it makes new highs if we get a rally into the the uh first cut but I doubt it uh will&#39;ll probably extinguish the rest of that position so again you see here late October 2022 and then again in March of 2023 when it was down at 90 you know got up to 190 when we were talking about it in July uh 180 and now it&#39;s at 160 again no matter where you slice it more than a double year and a half the framework continues to work uh smtc entered below 20 we took off the full position uh with a for handle some in July some in the last week uh same with uh C limited the reason we took this one off that one has gone from 32 uh lows to 83 and change uh we don&#39;t like the business enough and we have enough exposure to Asia e-commerce through Alibaba so we just booked that and then uh 3M we already told you uh this has been a monster we took we got out of this at 125 it went up to 135 now it&#39;s back to 130 uh would we consider reing this below 100 yes may we get that opportunity we don&#39;t know but again this is a huge move in a relatively short period of time and you book The win so the framework works over and over and over and sometimes it goes against you before it goes for you as a matter of fact every time it goes against you before it goes for you if you&#39;re doing a good job and um so so just some updates there now we&#39;ve got a tremendous amount of data and now we&#39;ve got our new batch that are bouncing around the lows and they&#39;re going to be our next batch of harvesting in the next year year and a half we&#39;re going to be doing this type of stuff for those of you who&#39;ve been following along and it&#39;s just going to work I mean 3M looked like it would never work in a million years by the way we still own all the svent that we got for free uh so that&#39;s exciting for for that and um all right so uh sentiment survey D data this came in at 45% bullish 24% bearish so look there&#39;s some bullishness it&#39;s being taken out of the market I think the look it all comes down to the jobs report I think the jobs report is going to come in uh week enough for to to to give people no doubt in their mind that the fed&#39;s going at least 25 possibly 50 I don&#39;t think they go 50 as I talked about with Mike because um he doesn&#39;t want to shock the market but I mean if it was unbelievably weak they might do 50 that would probably not be good for the market I think it&#39;s going to be um Goldilocks not too hot not too cold enough to guarantee the 25 and if that&#39;s turns out to be correct tomorrow and maybe the unemployment rate goes from 43 to 42 as as expected um we get the 25 it looks like the world&#39;s not falling apart and I think we probably see Equity strength into the first cut uh which would be a week and a half two weeks of super strength to suck every last person back in until we fall into some serious seasonal weakness both from an election year standpoint and a sell sell the news so uh we will use any of that strength to raise some more cash from some of our winners uh and be ready to either tactically hedge or have that catch ready to deploy in late October early November right before we get the election uh uh clearing up and end of year monster rally is our expectation uh auto sales volume thanks to Allen over there you know \n\n\nupdates there now we've got a tremendous amount of data and now we've got our new batch that are bouncing around the lows and they're going to be our next batch of harvesting in the next year year and a half we're going to be doing this type of stuff for those of you who've been following along and it's just going to work I mean 3M looked like it would never work in a million years by the way we still own all the svent that we got for free uh so that's exciting for for that and um all right so uh sentiment survey

going to come in uh week enough for to to to give people no doubt in their mind that the fed's going at least 25 possibly 50 I don't think they go 50 as I talked about with Mike because um he doesn't

hedge or have that catch ready to deploy in late October early November right before we get the election uh uh clearing up and end of year monster rally is our expectation uh auto sales volume thanks to Allen over there you know uhhere is  August numbers uh we're really uh August numbers to be announced so they they have been moving you know they were at 158 I think they're at 151 now which is not ideal but what do we have happening we have rates having rates coming down uh starting in um 20 starting in two weeks and you have incentives going up and as we move to the end of the year because of all the EV inventories and all that stuff they're going to just fire sale it start doing 10 15 10 12% incentives certainly on the EVs and probably 8 9% incentives on the regular cars which means in in round terms a $50,000 car is going to cost you $45,000 and rates are going to be lower and they're going to incentivize that in anticipation of maybe 100 basis points lower uh so you know you could see a situation where as we move towards the end of the year you see a lot of uh uh car ads that look something like this MSRP 50,000 5,000 incentives net 45,000 2.9% APR and that's going to get people off the couch that's going to get a lot of uh uh inventories flush through and that's going to get production ramping back up which is what we need to see to get the operating leverage humming in Cooper standard which we will US market breath is improving relative performance S&P equal weighted index has risen from the lows uh that's why a lot of these names have been big winners for us and we are going to uh look at that City chart that's amazing uh and we have harvested those ### MISCELLANEOUS\n3M I mean it's it's uh it's it's exciting to see th those working and I'm more excited to see the ones that we have are going to be much bigger uh in aggregate than than uh even those election years are different average Dow Jones Industrial monthly return since 1896 uh don't love going back to 1896 because the post pre-World War II data tends to be skewed however what they're implying\n\nwe have rates coming down uh starting in um 20 starting in two weeks and you have incentives going up and as we move to the end of the year because of all the EV inventories and all that stuff they&#39;re going to just fire sale it start doing 10 15 10 12% incentives certainly on the EVs and

MISCELLANEOUS\nthat in all years including election year September is uh 1% on average in election years it&#39;s better than um uh uh it&#39;s a positive month barely a positive month but a positive month uh so so that&#39;s that okay what 2024 looks like a lot like 2023 that&#39;s from Dietrich over at Carson I don&#39;t think that&#39;s really relevant but it it does look similar in which case it would be weakness into the end of October which is our base case followed by super uh strong year end rally I just think we&#39;re going to see a little bit of strength before that first cut and the Catalyst will probably be my guess is tomorrow&#39;s jobs report so\n\nhere is that in all years including election year September is uh 1% on average in election years it's better than um uh uh it's a positive month barely a positive month but a positive month uh so so that's that okay what 2024 looks like a lot like 2023 that's from Dietrich over at Carson I don't think that's really

little bit of strength before that first cut and the Catalyst will probably be my guess is tomorrow's jobs report so here is more seasonality from 1976 through 2023 this is a presidential year and you do see a big popup here into uh mid to late September before the rollover into late October prior to the election and that is more in line with how we're thinking about it let's see what happens August does well in election years yeah we know that but uh so what they're saying\n\n### MACRO_DATA_SLIDES\nhere is more seasonality from 1976 through 2023 this is a presidential year and you do see a big popup here into uh mid to late September before the rollover into late October prior to the election and that is more in line with how we're thinking about it let's see what happens August does well in election years yeah we know that but uh so what they're saying\n\nSeptember uh is a little weaker and that would be correct uh that also allows for the rally in late September and then a rollover before the end of the month which is what we like here&#39;s more good data from Carson this shows that that you do get this like early weakness and uncertainty and then a rally oddly into the 19th the FED meeting I believe is the 17th so this would be a natural moving back up to highs uh and then you just roll over after the 19th which um which is kind of how we&#39;re thinking about it does that mean we sell everything risk on risk off of course not most of our stuff uh now that we new new positions that we&#39;ve been able to put on it&#39;s so cheap it probably rallies when the market gets gets weak uh because money has to go somewhere as it rotates out of the mag 7 which will cause the market to uh to be weak in October because of the waiting GDP revisions from initial percentage uh consumer spending was the big thing that revised GDP up to 2.5% so everyone&#39;s saying that the uh GDP uh the consumer&#39;s dead it&#39;s not fully reflected I think in the case of you know the companies that have been hit Dollar General Dollar Tree Advanced Auto Parts by the way uh for sure uh by the lower-end consumer I think that was largely due to mismanagement the difference between Advanced Auto Parts and Dollar General and Dollar Tree is Advanced Auto Parts has a new jockey that&#39;s turning it around and they what&#39;s comical about the way the stock is acting right now and we&#39;ve taken advantage of it uh is that what um Shane o Kelly did in the last few weeks by selling off world pack is he took solvy risk off the table in other words bankruptcy is off the table okay and the stock was down from whatever 250 down to 60 or 50 now it&#39;s in the 40s um uh what with comp store sales Rising by the way and they&#39;re going to be using that money not just to pay down the debt which takes solvency risk off the table but to start to grow 100 new stores a year get back growth uh they&#39;ve they&#39;ve stabilized the existing business the market didn&#39;t like the soft guidance for the next two quarters same as Disney they didn&#39;t like the soft guidance for the next two quarters same as Dollar General same as Dollar Tree but it&#39;s temporary not permanent and don&#39;t count out this consumer as long as the fed&#39;s not too late and we believe so long as they go the 25 uh my our base case is 25 25 25 I would not be surprised if we do 75 to 100 and even though inflation is only you know is is much lower I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if they don&#39;t have to do more than 75 or 100 because I think inflation is going to oscillate between two and four and four and a half% for the next three to five years and they could probably hold the FED funds at 350 to four and get away with it um and that&#39;s the environment actually that value does well as well so um consumer spending contribution to GDP growth Services good look oh this is really interesting ladies and gentlemen this is what I was talking about dstock restock Goods demand is coming back and normalizing uh after it went negative in the first quarter it&#39;s back so that was our trough base case which was in fourth quarter of last year initial jobl claims climbing up that&#39;s why the FED is taking action uh let&#39;s see here yeah consumer spending still a big part of it S&P monthly returns going back to 1928 again this really pre-World War II data is not terribly helped full uh with September being the worst month that&#39;s from the mly flu full down 1.17% on average US pending home sales at historic lows what&#39;s going to change very quickly to change that is you know here&#39;s the thing a lot of people have an enormous amount of equity Boomers trapped in their houses and they can&#39;t get out because they don&#39;t want to trade a 3% mortgage for a 7% mortgage well what&#39;s going to happen is mortgage rates are going to go in drop into a five handle pretty damn quickly maybe it&#39;s 5&#39;9 it doesn&#39;t matter it&#39;s it&#39;s uh psychological with the 5% and while they weren&#39;t willing to do 7% they&#39;re going to be willing to trade 3 to five particularly if they book a seven fig profit on a house that they bought for you know an apple pie and two slices of ice cream 40 years ago is now worth a couple mil and maybe they&#39;ve taken a million of equity out at 3% and they can book a Mill and then buy a townhouse for a mill cash or or or or Finance one at five and change and uh and uh invest the the mill of profits uh and live happily ever after so the thing where I think they&#39;re going to get hurt that most of them don&#39;t realize is that as rates go down I think there&#39;s going to be a mad rush of supply pushed on the market massive amount of supply and for those who think well my my price is going to go even higher as rates go down because it trades like a bond I think they&#39;re going to be uh surprised that um uh they&#39;re going to have an enormous amount of competition with so many houses coming on all at once us pending home sales tumbled a record low in July that&#39;s going to change very quickly Japanese CPI going back up which means boj going to be hiking which means Yen going higher Juan going higher dollar going lower Japanese equities probably going lower Chinese Yuan strongest against the dollar since the beginning of the year moving in the right direction this is what we see when Chinese equities start going going up Chinese exports up 2.6% since October 2023 where it&#39;s going to the rest of the world they are much lower to the us but they are holding steady to the rest of the world so the rest of the world benefits from their sweat shops while we are not benefiting as much um that&#39;s a little bit of an exaggeration but I also think that&#39;s probably related to believe it or not automobiles we&#39;re not allowing Chinese cars in the US anytime soon uh so um and you know Germany&#39;s shutting down factories because they&#39;re letting the Chinese cars in so we&#39;ll see what happens there I think they&#39;re going to be a lot more tariffs coming to a theater nearu against the Chinese cars uh economic grievances fuel protests in China this is what we need to see to cause a bazooka type stimulus and we&#39;re going to talk we&#39;re going to show you some of the things they&#39;ve been doing in the last week top 10 cities for economic Pro protest shenzen leading the way uh and uh you can go down the list here protest linked to China&#39;s former real estate Giants Country Garden everr Etc the natives are getting restless uh moving on private clients bought Reit financials MLPs so opinion follows Trend they&#39;re dumping out of CH uh Japan rather not China there&#39;s no one left to sell China they&#39;re getting out of Japan buying financials what were we doing selling financials to you and uh fed easing history and SNP price return so everyone says that the um when the fed eases you get a recession that is not the case you did not get one the three times in 1980s 80 looks like 83 85 887 Market went up uh same thing with the midcycle cuts in 9598 same thing and I think we&#39;re going to be mid cycle here the probably the closest thing to this would be 80 to 83 we got the recession like in 2020 and 2022 and then the second one 83 easing Cy uh paves away for bull market and good things to come fed easing history and 10-year note yield well while equities go up and midcycle cuts bond yields go down every single time so we like that that&#39;s part of our core thesis treasury yields stay down dollar goes down Emerging Markets go up dividend pairs go up small caps go up value goes up mag 7 moderates we&#39;ve already started seeing that us real consumer spending Trends continue to go up services Goods durable goods are rocking and rolling again after a huge trough they had the huge Peak off the uh covid lows then they trough for multiple years and now they&#39;re picking back up cars uh washing machines you know we got we keep keeping an eye on Whirlpool that&#39;s one in our sites um that&#39;ll be a function of the housing recovery and you know we&#39;re kind of levered to that with j and Stanley Black and&amp; Decker anyway uh fed favored inflation gauges mild gain set stage for rate cut and okay consumer inflation expectations are at multi-year lows both on the uh uh oneyear expectations below three at 2.8 5year inflation expectations at three City economic surprise index in the Euro zone is turning back up that favors International stocks even the China Kon manufacturing PMI\n\nMLPs so opinion follows Trend they're dumping out of CH uh Japan rather not China there's no one left to sell China they're getting out of Japan buying financials

them back out there revering um mag 7 still owned by 70% or more of funds that bank of America tracks They are feeling some serious pain in the last two months like meaningful pain uh mag 7 earnings decelerating other 493 accelerating by the way you may want to go back to that article that I wrote in on June 20th you can just go to commentary and uh pull up the one that has Jensen Wong signing there you go the next pain trade and we talked about Nvidia and we talked about the mag 7 we&#39;re going to roll over when they&#39;re trading at all-time highs and that&#39;s what&#39;s taking

royal blue and aqua blue and you can see here the unmagnify have been flat to negative for over a year and they just inflected positive and they&#39;re re accelerating for the next 5 six quarters and Beyond while the mag 7 peaked all the way in 2021 declined we got that Tech recession in 2022 then they re accelerated uh last year to early this year and now they&#39;re going to decline from 50% down to 18% and maybe a little lower if they keep um uh spending all this money on uh AI chips that can&#39;t produce anywhere in line with the revenues required to make them have any positive return on investment which means they&#39;re having a negative return on Capital which uh is what&#39;s crushing margins which is what&#39;s causing their earnings to go down which is what&#39;s going to cause their stock prices to go down in in the near term uh which they already have breath is widening we saw that earlier magnificent 7 have underperformed the other 493 by 14 full percentage points since mid July okay go back to the next pain trade article when we talked about that hedge funds exposure to cyclicals versus defensive sectors is just off an all-time low this trade is reaccelerating this is just starting I love these extremes and the thing about extremes whether it&#39;s you know uh you know buying look this was an extreme buying Google down in October of 2023 when it was down 50% and uh March of I&#39;m sorry October 2022 and March 2023 look you know you could have bought it at 100 and it dropped another 20% to 80 you could buy Advanced Auto Parts at 50 or 60 it drops another 20% to 40 before you put in this base which takes you know in this case it took 6 months and then it was an easy double plus uh over the next year and a half and it&#39;s just over and over City you could buy at 42 it dropped down to 36 another 20% against you and then boom double off the lows so this stuff happens over and over Amazon same thing you could bought it at 90 or 100 it dropped to 80 20% against you all of a sudden back to 200 so you just have to have patience with this stuff if you know what you own and you buy good assets at good prices good things happen over time that&#39;s why you just take very limited leverage to no leverage and you play the time Arbitrage game you don&#39;t play the trade these silly little blips up and down and get your face ripped off you play the I bought a great business at a good price now I just wait for it to recover and sure enough when you do that framework over and over it works some of them just take a year some of them take three years some take longer but the framework works over and over I mean 3M felt like it was going to take forever and then when it happens it happens all at once this is what I think we&#39;re going to see in Alibaba I don&#39;t know when I think it&#39;s sooner than we all think but you know this thing took a year and a half year to build a base and then it happens all at once and I think the upside magnitude is going to be greater and by the way I don&#39;t know that 3M is over but you got to book some profits and then you know 3M drops back down to 100 we&#39;ll take another look at it but in the meantime we hold svent them free of charge thank you very much um last three months biotech saw the largest increase in relative relative weight we love that we still own our xbi there&#39;s another one by the way that&#39;s taken a long time okay xbi all right take a look at this thing this took this one is the one that takes longer and it by the way it&#39;s been trading kind of like the Chinese equities because of their interest rate sensitive what&#39;s starting in the next two weeks interest rates are going down what&#39;s going to go up China and biotech this looks like the Baba chart okay so let&#39;s just pull it up this looks exactly like the Boba chart okay so you have update come on baby yeah so this is wild so you have this collapse from $320 down to $70 and then um you get this rebound to 123 then it falls to $56 then it doubles to 2018 and it basically does nothing for a year and a half it&#39;s around $80 right look at xbi this is biotch collaps from 174 down to 61 uh then you get this rally then it grinds sideways and then you get what you get this big retest down like we got earlier this year uh and then boom a rally from 60 to 100 and now it&#39;s just starting to break out and recover that&#39;s the bio Tech and the same thing will start to happen just starting to recover here we&#39;re going to see this thing break over 90 and then We&#39;re Off to the Races uh and um and it&#39;s going to be exciting because it&#39;s going to be so hated all the way up I mean you&#39;re going to just have people criticizing and then I&#39;m telling you uh I Remember by the way in June um there were big Talking Heads getting super excited about Amazon at $200 because it had just broken out okay or I think it was 190 it just broken out they said I&#39;m buying the breakout and that&#39;s when we were just laying the off left and right uh the majority of the position and sold the rest of the position down here at 180 and change this week uh and um and you&#39;re going to see that with Alibaba when there&#39;s a two- handle on it you&#39;re all the people that hate it are going to be pounding the table on it uh and it&#39;s going to be fun and we&#39;re going to start laying off in the mid2 200s and hopefully uh some a lot higher moving on um boy we&#39;ve got a lot of great stuff this week uh hedge funds exposure to utilities is elevated versus history when we were pounding the table on utilities no one wanted them now what&#39;s happened after they&#39;re up 50% everyone wants them they can&#39;t get enough it&#39;s it&#39;s just over that&#39;s not it xlu okay no one wanted them last fall at 50 bucks now at 75 bucks they can&#39;t get enough uh I&#39;m not saying it&#39;s over I&#39;m just saying that there are times to buy and um and and and to outperform over time you have to buy when no one else wants it um private sector jobs at recessionary levels and credit need fresh hiring private X payrolls X Education Health contributions total payroll um all right so that&#39;s that bull and be indicator is not yet at an extreme that&#39;s why I think we&#39;re going to get some strength into that first cut we&#39;ll see uh secular bull Mark in in Commodities is just getting started we agree and we think this is set up to uh very similarly to that 2000 period 2000 to 2007 that&#39;s when emerging markets do exceptionally well well when Commodities take off this is fantastic this chart here Tech Telecom Healthcare versus Financial energy materials so basically growth versus value you can see and people forget these are normal regular Cycles you&#39;re just blinded by recency bias of the last handful of years when it looked like the only thing that could work is Tech Telecom Healthcare but if you look back um from two 2000 to 2007 it only looked like financials energies and materials could work while Microsoft was in the gutter and Cisco was in the gutter and Intel all the Darlings Amazon all the Darlings were of the of the &#39;90s tech boom were in the gutter and value was going like crazy Emerging Markets we&#39;re right at the same level and and what does that mean uh is the waiting of tech Telecom and health cares 44% it hit that high at the peak in 2000 here we are back at the peak in 2024 and what were the low levels and the peak levels for financials energy materials the lows were 24 in 2000 before it got up to 44% the same level the magic 44 doesn&#39;t mean this doesn&#39;t go to 50 and this doesn&#39;t go to 20 before you get the turnaround but these Cycles happen over and over again and when I&#39;ve been pounding the table is starting to be substantiated by earnings power now and soon we will see flows with the FED changing the regime new orders and inventory suggest ism is back at 52 by October so new orders and inventories restock cycle is picked back up um people are flying into re out of Japan we covered that the bullish indicator is not yet at extreme this is from slomer uh markets and S&amp;P Cycles what does best at the beginning of a new cycle bottoming in early uptrends China Canadian dollar energy transports small caps Emerging Markets this is where the big money will be in the next 24 months ladies and gentlemen and and what&#39;s finishing up their outperformance is the tech is winding down as these things are ramping up over and over what else happens in Industry Group Autos energy Pharma you know start looking at fizer some of these left for dead Pharma companies uh food and tobacco the horels of the world so anyway pretty exciting now this chart I mean I&#39;m so excited about this stuff and uh this chart shows how history repeats itself when one company gets too concentrated in the index how it doesn&#39;t last never has has never will General Motors was 10% uh all the way back in 1968 and it collapsed down to 0% uh IBM same thing got up to 3% of the total market cap of all stocks collapsed down to less than a half a percent Altria got up to 2 and a half% in 1993 collapsed down to less than a half a percent Cisco got up to 4% of total total market cap of of all US stocks and and then collapsed down to less than half a percent General Electric hit that magic 4% in 2000 collapsed down to nothing Exxon hit that magic 4% uh 4 a half% in uh 2009 collapsed all the way down Apple just hit 75% is rolling over Microsoft 7% we&#39;ll see Nvidia 6% starting to weaken so history Rhymes pay attention to the lyrics ladies and gentlemen uh Hong Kong retail sales volume index turning uh so this shows the normal sequence so everyone&#39;s saying oh it&#39;s weak it&#39;s weak it&#39;s always weak in the summer and then it turns back up every single year so the back half going to start to see this e-commerce kick up retail sales kick up and people are going to say what happened oh the economy turning well there&#39;s some seasonality around it as well household debt to disposable income we&#39;ve been covering this look how deleveraged total debt service ratio it&#39;s it&#39;s at historic lows okay it peaked in 2008 it&#39;s collapsed they can relever up all of this percentage and and the economy can Boom for the next 8 to 10 years and uh that&#39;s the base case as the young people take out mortgages to uh start families Etc median path of the S&amp;P 1984 to 2023 again more seasonality shows a little rally mid-september collapse and then endof year Rally from late October office vacancy rate is a record high this is changing in some areas I continue to say there are going to be some super wealthy clients of mine that listen to this every week that are going to figure out when and how to hold some of these higher class Office Buildings not buying the marginal stuff the BNC like the malls they&#39;re still vacant But the A and the B+ stuff that have 20% vacancy rates right now I&#39;m telling you when the unemployment rate goes up to 4 and a half 5% everyone is going to Scurry back to work and want FaceTime with their boss and these vacancy rates are going to go probably to 15% or 10% and if you bought some of these properties uh you&#39;re going to make double your money I mean it&#39;s going to be unreal and then because you&#39;re in real estate you don&#39;t pay any taxes and you&#39;re can do a 1035 Exchange and you&#39;re going to pull out you know a few hundred million out of it and uh and hopefully when you make your half a billion on your next office uh uh uh properties you know don&#39;t forget me send me send me 20 30 okay you know let you diversify some of that risk after you do your office trade all right China valued at just 40% of us markets this is like this is the kind of stuff where dreams are made of ladies and gentlemen when you can buy the mean two standard deviations out and even if it doesn&#39;t even get back to the mean you double and triple your money and that&#39;s where we are with China right now uh if it takes another six months God bless I could care less uh if it happens in 6 weeks that would be even better maybe I&#39;ll buy some Office Buildings with my friend who actually know what they&#39;re doing um anyway Costco again showing the [Music] um uh Costco is showing oh by the way welcome to Jeff a who&#39;s just texting me uh Jeff a and Stephen F who have just joined the team doing a great job on their respective roles um super excited to have them on board Costco these same tourist comp sales are off the the charts fantastic the total companies&#39;s 5% year onye uh e-commerce is up 22% so the consumer is not totally Dead uh this is from Mike zardi Global EPS estimates are ticking decidedly higher even China exclamation point and China is trading at just nine times earnings which is the name of the game Chinese estimates picking up not down up capex from all major hyperscale 191 billion so far this is why their margins are going down their spending is going up dramatically faster than their revenues declining margins they they need 600 billion of new Revenue to justify the amount of money they&#39;ve spent already never mind what they&#39;re going to spend this is like Global Crossing laying all those pipes in the late 1990s eventually those pipes came to use but by then Global Crossing was toast labor force growth native and immigration contribution uh basically foreign born immigration is having the biggest contribution to job growth earnings growth\n\nChina valued at just 40% of us markets this is like this is the kind of stuff where dreams are made of ladies and gentlemen when you can buy the mean two standard deviations out and even if it doesn't even get back to the mean you double and triple your money and that's where we are with China right now. \n### FEATURED_COMPANY_DEEP_DIVES\nCostco again showing the tourist comp sales are off the charts fantastic the total companies's 5% year onye uh e-commerce is up 22% so the consumer is not totally Dead. \n### MACRO_DATA_SLIDES\nGlobal EPS estimates are ticking decidedly higher even China exclamation point and China is trading at just nine times earnings which is the name of the game Chinese estimates picking up not down up capex from all major hyperscale 191 billion so far this is why their margins are going down their spending is going up dramatically faster than their revenues declining margins they they need 600 billion of new Revenue to justify the amount of money they've spent already never mind what they're going to spend this is like Global Crossing laying all those pipes in the late 1990s eventually those pipes came to use but by then Global Crossing was toast labor force growth native and immigration contribution uh basically foreign born immigration is having the biggest contribution to job growth earnings growth here is\n\nagain I keep emphasizing because this theme will make you the most money in the next couple of years mag 7 growth went from 50% to 35% to 18% next quarter to 19% what happened with UNM magificent 493 -2 to 6 next quarter will be+ 1 then plus 15% in the fourth quarter and uh and more next year PE ratio of the top 10 and remaining stocks in the S&amp;P 500 so if you back out the mag 7 which are going to come down or underperform the rest of the market is relatively cheap 18.4 times with 15% earnings growth is bar you know 1 two times Peg price price to earnings growth is pretty good pickings weight of the top 10 stocks in the S&amp;P 500 36% again mean reversion earnings contribution of the top 10 in the S&amp;P 500 is only 28% so they&#39;ve got 36% call it of the waiting at the peak with only 28% of the earnings growth and his historically what you see is that mean reverts very very quickly value versus growth in different interest rate environments what does value outperform best in it outperforms growth in environments between 4 to 5% and greater than 5% so that&#39;s why we could see a situation where we only go 125 to 150 for the whole cycle and that&#39;s an environment for like 2021 to 2027 value out performed dramatically for five six seven years along with Emerging Markets which in my book is value on any metric and um dividend payers and small caps median path of the S&amp;P around an uninversity % GDP growth uh this is the path which is upward why everyone worries is because often that happens and causes a recession uh I think this time has proven well one we already had the recession that everyone&#39;s waiting for in 20122 they just didn&#39;t declare it despite two quarters of negative GDP growth which we&#39;ve covered at infinitum on this podcast uh technology jobs are where all the cuts are happening you&#39;re seeing it already 40,000 some OD Cuts since July uh that&#39;s going to continue us equities versus Commodities at 2 and 1/2 year High We Believe Commodities are just reaccelerating there&#39;s going to be huge opportunities right now we&#39;re expressed through um comto which we love we have albamar which is a smaller newer position uh we haven&#39;t leaned into yet but we&#39;re actively looking for more opportunity to get exposure uh seasonality of since 1976 Presidential year we covered this again rally into midt rollover after secular bull market in Commodities just beginning we&#39;re covered that GDP growth boost due to AI will boost oil Demand by 200,000 barrels per day in 5 years 700,000 barrels per day in 10 years we are in the middle of a rough patch this is from Dietrich over at Carson but the rough patch doesn&#39;t begin until the 17th it shows the average return per day from 1950 to 2023 as you can see all the red comes from the 18th to the 30th of September all the green is beforehand with a little bit of spottiness early in the month which we saw this week so that&#39;s data like there&#39;s nobody&#39;s business \n### QUOTES_OF_THE_WEEK\nmoving on to the quote of the weeks you from Buffett you can&#39;t reach success in investment if you do not think independently uh you know people could fault me for a lot of things but no one will ever accuse me of not thinking independently that I can damn assure you uh there&#39;s no uh her following uh here that&#39;s for sure Charlie Munger a lot of people with high IQs are terrible investors because they&#39;ve got terrible temp forments and by the way not just highq but super successful entrepreneurs who get paid for Massive Action yielding massive results and in our business we have to have the discipline to take inaction massive inaction gets the best results when you&#39;ve done your work you just sit on your butt and wait and don&#39;t get faked out like everyone trading the short-term noise\n### HEADLINES_AND_NEWS\nChina&#39;s internet users near 1.1 billion that is still a growing Market driven by short videos mobile payments alibaba&#39;s participating on both fronts Alibaba wins beijing&#39;s approval ending years long scrutiny so what began with this antitrust Watchdog in 2021 which caused the stock to collapse from 320 down to 56 uh is now officially over this was announced on Friday uh uh August 30th and Baba secured the Endor M of China&#39;s Anti-Trust Watchdog more than 3 years after a landmark probe into its online Behavior suggesting Beijing is Keen to Signal its support for the country&#39;s giant internet sector amen hallelujah Alibaba shares rise after it completes threeyear regulatory overhaul uh Alibaba is completely stopped the quote choose one of two Monopoly Behavior the SM samr said uh completed the rectification process that started in 2021 China&#39;s Market regulator said on Friday it&#39;s an interesting timing considering they&#39;re in the market buying bonds I and they&#39;re in the market buying equities it wouldn&#39;t surprise me if I&#39;m the government I want to use the southbound connect opportunity When Baba starts to move to juice that stock if they juice the the alab Baba stock the entire world will start to flow back into China uh and all they have to do is move one stock and it&#39;s not even moving it it&#39;s you know it&#39;s funny someone said to me like oh um see people think that alibaba&#39;s business has to double from here for the stock to double from here and that couldn&#39;t be further from the truth the business is actually grown since the stock has been $300 what you had was multiple like unprecedented multiple contraction because of government interference once in a 100y Year events you name it all the that we know about is now over so what&#39;s going to happen as earnings go up is all of these higher quality Chinese companies are going to start to get multiple doesn&#39;t we don&#39;t even have to say multiple expansion multiple normalization would be a double alone with no improvement in business performance and then uh markets uh overshoot on both sides despondency on the downside Euphoria so you&#39;re not going to get a reversion to the mean you&#39;re going to get a reversion well above the mean and at the same time the business is going to continue to improve they stop they stop P pinu Duo dead in their tracks we saw in the last two quarters if you read both transcripts you&#39;re going to realize uh they&#39;re competition picked up from Alibaba Alibaba fell asleep at the wheel and they walk up right before they drove the car over the bridge and they said no MOS and they went brutal guns blazing at pindu Duo and pushed them back and now they&#39;re back on a run and the game is back on so uh then you get the Tailwind of the economy then you get the government you know uh starting to move on policy because protests are happening etc etc and we&#39;re We&#39;re Off to the Races but this is a huge message at an interesting time with the southbound connect expected to go live as soon as next week which means both the company will be able to buy back shares without issuing convert because they can buy it uh with their local currency uh the Chinese government would have an easier time buying it and uh and 180 to 220 million new retail investors who have not been able to buy the Amazon of their own country for 10 years will now be able to Own It For the First Time their National Champion Ali Baba only one National Champion ladies and gentlemen Chinese e-commerce giant pindu Duo updates rules to kick out sellers of shotty products this is hysterical which basically means they will have no more sellers I mean you can&#39;t make this stuff off uh China is trading its own bonds to stifle a runaway Bond rally yields are going to start going up that we talked about that Yuan goes up yields go up stocks go up uh Yen goes up China stocks listed in Us near cheapest levels ever versus NASDAQ peers uh Golden Dragon index valued at record discount to NASDAQ 100 this always mean reverts the last time it got this low was 2014 and not only did it mean revert it overshot then the same thing in 2008 2009 not only did it mean revert it overshoots this is the PE spread last time it was this close was again 2014 2015 and then back in 2006 uh Etc so pretty exciting stuff there Biden uh okay so Intel when&#39;s the next Catalyst number one I think we&#39;re going to wake up one morning and someone like Elliott or some other major activist is going to be in the stock why because if they liquidate the whole company they get their money back if they follow through on the plan and create value they get double or triple their money back so all they have to do is shake a few trees and the stock will go up so this is a no-brainer for an activist but the board is having a meeting midt according to people familiar with the matter this is in Bloomberg um and um so we&#39;ll get stuff like maybe not doing the German Factory um selling off some of these non-core uh assets like Mobil ey and uh there was a a couple other non-core that they talked about uh and really the plan forward and then whether G singer&#39;s head goes on the chopping block or not I don&#39;t know that that&#39;s the right move I I um I mean unless they announce like just an unbelievable name but um we&#39;ll see but change is coming and that&#39;s a good thing especially when you have a stock trading a tangible book China weighs cutting mortgage rates in two steps to Shield Banks officials proposed rate cuts of about 80 basis points move to boost household consumption ease pressure on banks who is the toll taker for household consumption in China the answer is tabba t-all Alibaba China hundred billion doll short against dollar enriches hedge fund state owned banks are helping support the Yuan and the tra and they are doing so with a hundred billion doll short on the US dollar Chip War Taiwan accuses eight Mainland Chinese firms of poaching talent and stealing Secrets what did you expect them to do with the sanctions again just to reiterate all we did was take them off our tit they were they were dependent on us to buy all their chips and we said we are not selling you chips anymore in the name of National Security and the result is now they&#39;re going to poach all the talent around the world pay these guys four times not only are they going to poach Taiwanese they&#39;re going to poach Americans and they&#39;re going to get all the intellectual property and instead of being dependent and giving us all the money uh sooner or later we&#39;re going to be giving them all the money and that was just bad policy uh shortsightedness and um you know so for everyone worried about them not having the chips for AI they already got them Microsoft rolled out AI PCS that can&#39;t play Top Games and there&#39;s no quick fix it&#39;s the Qualcomm arm processor chips what&#39;s their Quick Fix notice the the one company that is not in this article is Intel who shipped 40 million AIP PCS this year the leader in aip&#39;s no problemos with intellos chios so the moral of the story is they do have value and Moes Etc uh here&#39;s whether they&#39;re going to get rid of gelsinger or not we&#39;ll see uh Intel is trading at tangible books says Thomas Hayes on Fox Business Intel uh more on Intel oh working a variety of options uh anyways and activist defense Yuan hits strongest in over a year as flows offset fundamentals that will be more the case after the first cut this is what we need to see Northface parent VF Corp sees big Insider stock by so one of the board member you know Bracken made a million of purchases we know that and former Chief Financial of Yum brands who sits on the board bought 350,000 I mean this guy it&#39;s not a huge amount of money but he&#39;s a CFO of young Brands probably worth five or 10 million

my friend in Dallas got me this beautiful cup opinions not advice booya hedge fun tips what a thoughtful amazing gift and then they also got me this when I did episode 200 um all right world smallest violin so when you look and you find this article click on commentary or click on most popular post it&#39;s the number one most popular post today and probably will be tomorrow as well so this shows the chart since 1974 and you&#39;re looking at uh 50 years five decades and what you see is it keeps having these Corrections and it keeps recovering to new highs and it keeps having these Corrections and it keeps recovering to new highs it keeps having these Corrections keeps recovering to new highs keeps having these Corrections keeps recovering to new highs and this time will be no different why because it&#39;s a duopoly and people like to fly and they can only get their planes from two companies which have 99% of the market Bombardier tried to do it they got smoked okay the US government said you can do it but we&#39;re going to charge you 300% tariffs so tells you everything you need to know um you also see the table and the chart above are all you need to know about duopolistic Boeing for decades it has had periods of negative free cash flow followed by free cash flow recoveries negative free cash flow free cash flow recovery negative free cash flow free cash flow recovery negative free cash flow free cash flow recovery it has had periods of dips in revenues followed by recoveries to new highs in revenues that&#39;s called a cyclical business not a secular grower a cyclical grower here you saw in the mid90s a dip in recovery followed by a Rec recovery in revenues dip in revenues followed by a recovery in 2000 dip in revenues 2004 followed by a recovery dip in revenues 2008 followed by recovery dip in revenues 2011 followed by recovery dip in revenues in a one in 100 Year event in 2021 starting to recover and it goes on and on it has had periods of dips in stock price followed by recoveries to new highs in stock price this time will be no different okay so you got a160 stock that over time will be a $436 stock at least and probably higher than that we don&#39;t know if that&#39;s in 3 years we don&#39;t know if that&#39;s in 5 years so if it goes to 100 before it goes to 400 and you own it at $160 is that a life-threatening thing no unless you own it on margin and leverage or you&#39;re impatient or don&#39;t understand what you own uh more likely than not maybe it goes to 150 we add a few more shares and then it starts to work its way towards 300 over the next three plus years and we make it double over three years which is in line with our uh acceptable irr over time and uh and we can sleep at well at night putting siiz on in a pos position like this because now we actually have an engineer running the company who created a four bagger while he did in six years in Rockwell Collins which which is in a similar business or an ancillary business uh so that&#39;s that Tuesday&#39;s downgrade by a short-termist cide analyst was comical quote Boeing delays its1 billion a year free cash flow Target by one year from 2026 to 2027 for those slow with math the market cap is just a hundred billion dollar right now or 10 times two years out free cash flow a 10% free cash flow yield here was the Reuters article citing one of the most ridiculous analyst reports I&#39;ve seen in my years in the business annual cash flow may be delayed to 2027 2028 and it would have to raise $30 billion before developing a new aircraft Wells Fargo said in the downgraded stock shares in the Dell component fell 7% Boeing carries about 45 billion in net debt it must address this before it kicks off the next aircraft development cycle cutting the debt would consume its cash flow through 2030 here&#39;s he goes on to say given a likely new aircraft launch Boeing will need to shore up the balance sheet sooner uh said XYZ analyst who is rated three out of five stars for estimate accuracy on lseg workspace I wouldn&#39;t even go to a taco place rated three out of five never mind invest based on their opinion all right we estimate roughly 30 billion Equity raise to get back to zero net debt by 2027 number one is Dave Ramsey Boeing&#39;s new financial advisor like who the hell said anything about net debt getting to zero why would you ever do that I mean it you can&#39;t even make this stuff up like this guy just got out of a Tony Robins seminar is walking on coals talking about being debt free it doesn&#39;t work that way in the real world my man so let&#39;s talk about the Five Points number one this is the silliest statement I&#39;ve ever seen an analyst put in writing quote we estimate a roughly 30 billion Equity raised to get back to zero net debt why would they ever go into zero net debt when did Dave Ramsey become Boeing&#39;s new financial adviser number two why is RO Reuters quoting an analyst who is ranked quote three out of five stars for accuracy you can&#39;t make this stuff up number three why would they start a new plane in fears of losing share when their competitor already has a backlog as large as theirs spanning a decade out for plane models they already produce it&#39;s like oh let&#39;s start a new plane that we can&#39;t afford to start even though we can&#39;t even deliver 10 years worth of orders worth $500 billion do of backlog let&#39;s start a new product you can&#39;t make this stuff up and furthermore let&#39;s raise $30 billion of equity and dude our shareholders for a product that we don&#39;t even need for a decade okay common sense is the most uncommon thing so number four even the analyst seeds quote their free cash flow could Spike to 20 billion dollars a year if they delay their next airplane development cycle duh I wonder what they&#39;re going to do number five I will be sending this analyst a Christmas card for allowing us to expand our position in the high 150s we are grateful for your service please write several more notes so we can add more size at lower prices and number six total company backlog is $516 billion including over 5,400 commercial airplanes for those worried about the quote health of Boeing may I offer you the world&#39;s smallest violin they&#39;ll be just fine only a matter of when not if and we scroll up so you can see the world&#39;s smallest violin moving on key catalyst is the new CEO Kelly ortberg who started on August 8th as CEO of Rockwell Collins he doubled sales in six years and quadrupled 4x the value of the company for shareholders before selling it at a price premium to United Technologies in 2019 um and so on so then we go into a nice report from Morning Star I like morning star&#39;s framework because they&#39;re all Buffet ties if you go out to the annual meetings they&#39;re always there they have a good investment framework and I you know we&#39;re running 112 all right we could go through some of these points but you can read it on your own the key\n\n### FEATURED_COMPANY_DEEP_DIVES\ncan&#39;t make this stuff up number three why would they start a new plane in fears of losing share when

know we&#39;re running 112 all right we could go through some of these points but you can read it on your own the key here is  that there are only two players in town they have 99% of the market there&#39;s a Chinese player that&#39;s uh their their planes go Boeing&#39;s planes go 75% further they don&#39;t compete on any metric so they&#39;ll sell a bunch of crappy planes to their own Chinese Airlines no one outside of China is going to buy a Chinese airplane that I can guarantee you and even the ones inside if they want to be competitive they got to have Boeing and Airbus so uh um the Chinese company will maybe take if they&#39;re lucky uh let&#39;s see arj21 that&#39;s a company called comac they&#39;ve been trying to do this for 10 15 years Chinese carrier uh carriers took delivery of 30 almost 30 aircraft per month on average we have no reason to believe that ramping up the larger and more complex c919 will be an easier process than ramping up arj which has taken them you know 15 plus years and um the 737 Max 7 for instance can travel roughly 75% more nautical miles than than comx similar size c919 and the economics Drive Airline purchase decisions in some the technical complexity of aircraft manufacturing is a material barrier to entry which we believe constitutes intangible Boeing and Airbus are the only two capable suppliers of globally competitive aircraft larger than 130 seats and we don&#39;t see any Global competitive new entrance entering the market anytime soon therefore we believe it&#39;s reasonable to assume that almost all Global demand for new air CL will flow through the income statement of a comment incumbents that we conc that some Chinese demand will likely move toward com back um Market is large enough and unders supplied enough to support two wide modes we built a 20-year aviation forecast for deliveries Etc Market will return to undersupplied state that both manufacturers will continue to benefit from barriers to entry and switching costs from lack of alternative suppliers I mean this is this is a business made in heaven\n### MACRO_DATA_SLIDES\nearnings Russell small cap earnings estimates last 60 days up 2.19% for next year this year Le becomes less we only got three more months left uh and for next year on S&P up 76% which is also Al positive so estimates keep going up not down everyone&#39;s been waiting for them to go down they&#39;re going up up up tomorrow what are we looking for estimates are 164,000 non-farm payroll so I think below 100 people would get nervous and start to price in a 50 basis point cut I think at uh above 200 maybe people would get a little nervous about no cut but I they already told you they&#39;re going to do a cut so I think you want to see a number above 164 like I think 140 to 180 is good and that probably gets the market back uh getting bid again for the next week and a half uh below 100 I don&#39;t know above 250 I don&#39;t know but you know

details on macro and individual companies I also look forward to Thursday when your video cast and H quick notes it&#39;s great education for me the last eight months I do share the link with my friends and family thank you very much that helps by the way if you&#39;re W uh if you&#39;re watching on YouTube or if you&#39;re not watching on YouTube go to YouTube find the video click like And subscribe add a comment below that programs YouTube&#39;s algorithm to show it to more people more people that see it the longer I&#39;m going to do it for non-clients so do that and benefit and uh and share it with your friends if you got value the best thing you can do rather than the compliment is email the link tonight to one of your friends that loves markets and uh preferably has some money and after they listen to me for a year or two they&#39;ll become an investor but uh at the just anyone you can help is really what it comes down to uh okay my question is broader view of options you had mentioned in a call that you made 3 to 4X on options and we&#39;ve made a lot more than that by the way uh on others uh to understand and learn options how you work on call spread versus put spread as these turnaround takes 12 months plus if it&#39;s a client uh high level knowledge read all the McMillan books options as a in strategy you got to learn all the Greeks and then it&#39;s just experience um yeah I I mean everyone wants one year sentences the key is start with the base knowledge that&#39;s all the McMillan books on options first you have to have the base framework then you have to understand markets then you have to understand the underlying fundamentals of the stock and and the spreads are just a way to magnify the return on an individual idea which we do uh exclusively for clients and that&#39;s the secret sauce that they get over time uh and benefit from so you&#39;re not getting everything for free clients have an edge uh and they largely underwrite the benefits that you get from the podcast but uh that&#39;s where I would start and thank you so much for watching listening and sharing Frank Brown I hope you had a great holiday weekend really L listening to your recent podcast with Brendan Ahern as well by the way in your pod I was laughing so hard when you mentioned I don&#39;t use Callaway while reviewing Top Golf I just wanted to your overall thoughts on Gap by the way I got that new driver from Crank it&#39;s the one that um Bryson D Shambo uses crank golf think it sounds like an eastn baseball bat and what&#39;s amazing about it is because I play blades I play misso blades for my irons and I I got the ultra jumbo grips too the ultra light don&#39;t get the regular ones because it messes up the swing weight um and that&#39;s kept my hands so quiet which is why I think I&#39;m hitting the ball great again um but that crank driver you get away with murder and the thing just smashes so uh check that out too I know a lot of you have picked up lab Putters and uh are are loving it as much as I do so look I&#39;m just sharing my process I I you know I&#39;m the guy asking the am asking the amas when it comes to golf not answering them uh so uh uh you know if you&#39;re following my process H you know that I&#39;m just telling you what I&#39;m I&#39;m benefiting from these days all right wanted your oval TOS on Gap as a consumer discretionary oh this is the perennial train wreck of a company they never seem to get it right and it always looks attractive uh we did this a few weeks ago and I said no I I&#39;m still not going to change my mind on that but thanks Frank I know it&#39;s cheap I know all that stuff they just seem to continually snatch Victory from the jaws of defeat or excuse me snatch defeat from the jaws of Victory uh uh venod we covered you Kayla Smith enjoy the show uh here&#39;s an odd one do you have any thoughts on Western Union uh we covered this one like two or three months ago the answer was no it is cheap it&#39;ll probably stay cheap it&#39;s maybe a trading vehicle up to 20 but uh I don&#39;t not for me thanks for tuning in and thanks for the kind words Sam Boeing you like Boeing but Airbus has a similar market cap and less debt similar Revenue also why don&#39;t you prefer Airbus the only thing I like from France is their cheese next question Drew burn appreciate your first class weekly content and media appearances I keep spreading the word grateful for your thoughts on initiating the small qxo position it&#39;s not that small by the way uh don&#39;t take it that I&#39;m jock yeah we bought it after the dilution so our basis is $12.69 I think um and its liquidation value is $670 uh so I&#39;m giving the guy 100% credit 100% premium because he&#39;s Brad Jacobs and he&#39;s the only guy that&#39;s ever compounded money at double digits consistently overtime across five companies and made tens of billions of dollars for his owners so it would be basically like saying hey there&#39;s a guy named Warren Buffett you know if Warren Buffett started a new insurance vehicle and said I&#39;m going to rebuild birkshire uh I&#39;d be interested so this guy&#39;s done it five times creates multi Baggers every time he does it and I got to pay two times cash to have a free option on him doing another deal and a roll up in the Home Building Supply business which is going to Boom for the next 10 years because of the the starter home explosion from the Millennials or biggest generation for the next 10 years and I get to bet on the best jockey who&#39;s ever done it in history who doesn&#39;t do stupid deals who does a creative deals and um and uh respects ownership and put up a billion dollars of his own money side by side so oh excuse me he&#39;s got it $2 cheaper than I do and if you do the math he gets 10 to 15% of the industry which is $60 billion with a 10 to 15% free cash flow yield you basically have a 10 bagger over a decade so for me if I pay $6 or I paid $12 I&#39;d rather pay six that was never on the table some people got in at nine and change God bless them they&#39;re smarter than I am so they got a $3 better deal I&#39;m paying over cash but I&#39;m betting on a winner so there&#39;s nothing to think about here so yeah we bought it after the delution when it fell from whatever it was 60 to 10 or whatever qxo yeah there were some idiots when there was no float traded up to 290 when a crash down to 10 we started building and and got again at 12269 it could easily go to to cash value if he doesn&#39;t do a deal and if he does do a deal it could pop to $20 overnight so I like it um next by Gman uh thank you for your data and historically driven opinion I have several of your client stocks in my portfolio well you don&#39;t know exactly what my client stocks are uh your opinion on o xlc o xlc Oxford Lane Capital Corp no interest in anything like this too opaque you&#39;re never going to know what&#39;s in their portfolio so pass but thank you for sending it John Lee uh thanks for your insights as always my question is if you had a small sum of money would you rather buy a great business at a fair price or an average business at a great price if neither what approach would you generally follow if you had a small sum of money uh I take all that money and invest in education because you&#39;re not going to compound a small amount of money into anything meaningful so invest in your own skill sets get your earnings power up so you have a large amount of money to compound and um look I like turnarounds turnaround Tom and that doesn&#39;t mean I&#39;m buying the best best businesses I&#39;m just buying businesses that are down enough with a margin of safety where solvency risk is at or off near or off the table and then I just play the time Arbitrage game and get a double or triple in a few years and on to the next uh that&#39;s what I do so you could say oh why don&#39;t you just buy businesses with a 20% return on Capital and hold them forever because nothing&#39;s forever so people are going to see those and they&#39;re going to Rod at their things and you know everyone looks in hindsight bias if you just bought monster beverage I mean look at Celsius the thing is down 75% same same story as Monster and completely different results so hindsight bias is is very misleading Davis but when I buy with a margin save I know can get that double or triple in a few years in aggregate I&#39;ll do that all day long that&#39;s all I need to do everyone&#39;s happy Divas lung Tom I&#39;ve been listening to your podcast for a while enjoying every moment of free content was wondering ing what your opinion is on B&#39;s recent drop is there enough margin of safety for you to take a look yes I&#39;m only going to participate in China through Alibaba I mean I think there are a lot of risk for search they&#39;re the Google of um China uh and I&#39;m not smart enough to figure out how big how great their mode is my guess is this when China goes up B is going to do just fine and go up as well but for me I have outs we talk about this every week poker lots of outs I got the cloud I got the the non-core business I got all the AI stuff that we own that I don&#39;t even know uh every single startup AI startup equity&#39;s got uh alibaba&#39;s got equity in through exchanging them credits with the AI with um compute power so um for shipo I&#39;ve got uh aidc growing at 32% a year tbell and te- all turning around so there&#39;s a lot of ways to win with bu do it&#39;s binary there search uh it stays competitive or it doesn&#39;t and I&#39;m not smart enough to figure that out so um or predict that future next uh it&#39;s talking about autosar which we covered do you think that the rate Cuts along with dealer incentives can move enough vehicles that are piling up over ice and hybrid yes sooner or later and the key thing is don&#39;t do it on Leverage they&#39;ve got their cost basis down to a decent level we&#39;d rather it sooner rather than later but it&#39;ll happen and when it happens it happens all at once um okay next is that&#39;s it we&#39;re done see you next week same time same place I&#39;ll be back in New York by then in the meantime client potential clients out in California Coffee 30 minutes in Orange County maybe even LA County but really Orange County happy to do it um and thank you all for tuning in in the meantime make it a great one\n\nDivas lung Tom I&#39;ve been listening to your podcast for a while enjoying every moment of free content was wondering ing

    "HEADLINES_AND_NEWS": "\n\n### HEADLINES_AND_NEWS\nfor the weekending September 5th 2024 a lot of great stuff to cover uh first we'll start with family then we'll get right\n\nagain I keep emphasizing because this theme will make you the most money in the next couple of years mag 7 growth went from 50% to 35% to 18% next quarter to 19% what happened with UNM magificent 493 -2 to 6 next quarter will be+ 1 then plus 15% in the fourth quarter and uh and more next year PE ratio of the top 10 and remaining stocks in the S&amp;P 500 so if you back out the mag 7 which are going to come down or underperform the rest of the market is relatively cheap 18.4 times with 15% earnings growth is bar you know 1 two times Peg price price to earnings growth is pretty good pickings weight of the top 10 stocks in the S&amp;P 500 36% again mean reversion earnings contribution of the top 10 in the S&amp;P 500 is only 28% so they&#39;ve got 36% call it of the waiting at the peak with only 28% of the earnings growth and his historically what you see is that mean reverts very very quickly value versus growth in different interest rate environments what does value outperform best in it outperforms growth in environments between 4 to 5% and greater than 5% so that&#39;s why we could see a situation where we only go 125 to 150 for the whole cycle and that&#39;s an environment for like 2021 to 2027 value out performed dramatically for five six seven years along with Emerging Markets which in my book is value on any metric and um dividend payers and small caps median path of the S&amp;P around an uninversity % GDP growth uh this is the path which is upward why everyone worries is because often that happens and causes a recession uh I think this time has proven well one we already had the recession that everyone&#39;s waiting for in 20122 they just didn&#39;t declare it despite two quarters of negative GDP growth which we&#39;ve covered at infinitum on this podcast uh technology jobs are where all the cuts are happening you&#39;re seeing it already 40,000 some OD Cuts since July uh that&#39;s going to continue us equities versus Commodities at 2 and 1/2 year High We Believe Commodities are just reaccelerating there&#39;s going to be huge opportunities right now we&#39;re expressed through um comto which we love we have albamar which is a smaller newer position uh we haven&#39;t leaned into yet but we&#39;re actively looking for more opportunity to get exposure uh seasonality of since 1976 Presidential year we covered this again rally into midt rollover after secular bull market in Commodities just beginning we&#39;re covered that GDP growth boost due to AI will boost oil Demand by 200,000 barrels per day in 5 years 700,000 barrels per day in 10 years we are in the middle of a rough patch this is from Dietrich over at Carson but the rough patch doesn&#39;t begin until the 17th it shows the average return per day from 1950 to 2023 as you can see all the red comes from the 18th to the 30th of September all the green is beforehand with a little bit of spottiness early in the month which we saw this week so that&#39;s data like there&#39;s nobody&#39;s business \n### QUOTES_OF_THE_WEEK\nmoving on to the quote of the weeks you from Buffett you can&#39;t reach success in investment if you do not think independently uh you know people could fault me for a lot of things but no one will ever accuse me of not thinking independently that I can damn assure you uh there&#39;s no uh her following uh here that&#39;s for sure Charlie Munger a lot of people with high IQs are terrible investors because they&#39;ve got terrible temp forments and by the way not just highq but super successful entrepreneurs who get paid for Massive Action yielding massive results and in our business we have to have the discipline to take inaction massive inaction gets the best results when you&#39;ve done your work you just sit on your butt and wait and don&#39;t get faked out like everyone trading the short-term noise\n### HEADLINES_AND_NEWS\nChina&#39;s internet users near 1.1 billion that is still a growing Market driven by short videos mobile payments alibaba&#39;s participating on both fronts Alibaba wins beijing&#39;s approval ending years long scrutiny so what began with this antitrust Watchdog in 2021 which caused the stock to collapse from 320 down to 56 uh is now officially over this was announced on Friday uh uh August 30th and Baba secured the Endor M of China&#39;s Anti-Trust Watchdog more than 3 years after a landmark probe into its online Behavior suggesting Beijing is Keen to Signal its support for the country&#39;s giant internet sector amen hallelujah Alibaba shares rise after it completes threeyear regulatory overhaul uh Alibaba is completely stopped the quote choose one of two Monopoly Behavior the SM samr said uh completed the rectification process that started in 2021 China&#39;s Market regulator said on Friday it&#39;s an interesting timing considering they&#39;re in the market buying bonds I and they&#39;re in the market buying equities it wouldn&#39;t surprise me if I&#39;m the government I want to use the southbound connect opportunity When Baba starts to move to juice that stock if they juice the the alab Baba stock the entire world will start to flow back into China uh and all they have to do is move one stock and it&#39;s not even moving it it&#39;s you know it&#39;s funny someone said to me like oh um see people think that alibaba&#39;s business has to double from here for the stock to double from here and that couldn&#39;t be further from the truth the business is actually grown since the stock has been $300 what you had was multiple like unprecedented multiple contraction because of government interference once in a 100y Year events you name it all the that we know about is now over so what&#39;s going to happen as earnings go up is all of these higher quality Chinese companies are going to start to get multiple doesn&#39;t we don&#39;t even have to say multiple expansion multiple normalization would be a double alone with no improvement in business performance and then uh markets uh overshoot on both sides despondency on the downside Euphoria so you&#39;re not going to get a reversion to the mean you&#39;re going to get a reversion well above the mean and at the same time the business is going to continue to improve they stop they stop P pinu Duo dead in their tracks we saw in the last two quarters if you read both transcripts you&#39;re going to realize uh they&#39;re competition picked up from Alibaba Alibaba fell asleep at the wheel and they walk up right before they drove the car over the bridge and they said no MOS and they went brutal guns blazing at pindu Duo and pushed them back and now they&#39;re back on a run and the game is back on so uh then you get the Tailwind of the economy then you get the government you know uh starting to move on policy because protests are happening etc etc and we&#39;re We&#39;re Off to the Races but this is a huge message at an interesting time with the southbound connect expected to go live as soon as next week which means both the company will be able to buy back shares without issuing convert because they can buy it uh with their local currency uh the Chinese government would have an easier time buying it and uh and 180 to 220 million new retail investors who have not been able to buy the Amazon of their own country for 10 years will now be able to Own It For the First Time their

means they will have no more sellers I mean you can&#39;t make this stuff off uh China is trading its own bonds to stifle a runaway Bond rally yields are going to start going up that we talked about that Yuan goes up yields go up stocks go up uh Yen goes up China stocks listed in Us near cheapest levels ever versus NASDAQ peers uh Golden Dragon index valued at record discount to NASDAQ 100 this always mean reverts the last time it got this low was 2014 and not only did it mean revert it overshot then the same thing in 2008 2009 not only did it mean revert it overshoots this is the PE spread last time it was this close was again 2014 2015 and then back in 2006 uh Etc so pretty exciting stuff there Biden uh okay so Intel when&#39;s the next Catalyst number one I think we&#39;re going to wake up one morning and someone like Elliott or some other major activist is going to be in the stock why because if they liquidate the whole company they get their money back if they follow through on the plan and create value they get double or triple their money back so all they have to do is shake a few trees and the stock will go up so this is a no-brainer for an activist but the board is having a meeting midt according to people familiar with the matter this is in Bloomberg um and um so we&#39;ll get stuff like maybe not doing the German Factory um selling off some of these non-core uh assets like Mobil ey and uh there was a a couple other non-core that they talked about uh and really the plan forward and then whether G singer&#39;s head goes on the chopping block or not I don&#39;t know that that&#39;s the right move I I um I mean unless they announce like just an unbelievable name but um we&#39;ll see but change is coming and that&#39;s a good thing especially when you have a stock trading a tangible book China weighs cutting mortgage rates in two steps to Shield Banks officials proposed rate cuts of about 80 basis points move to boost household consumption ease

Secrets what did you expect them to do with the sanctions again just to reiterate all we did was take them off our tit they were they were dependent on us to buy all their chips and we said we are not selling you chips anymore in the name of National Security and the result is now they&#39;re going to poach all the talent around the world pay these guys four times not only are they going to poach Taiwanese they&#39;re going to poach Americans and they&#39;re going to get all the intellectual property and instead of being dependent and giving us all the money uh sooner or later we&#39;re going to be giving them all the money and that was just bad policy uh shortsightedness and um you know so for everyone worried about them not having the chips for AI they already got them Microsoft rolled out AI PCS that can&#39;t play Top Games and there&#39;s no quick fix it&#39;s the Qualcomm arm processor chips what&#39;s their Quick Fix notice the the one company that is not in this article is Intel who shipped 40 million AIP PCS this year the leader in aip&#39;s no problemos with intellos chios so the moral of the story is they do have value and Moes Etc uh here&#39;s whether they&#39;re going to get rid of gelsinger or not we&#39;ll see uh Intel is trading at tangible books says Thomas Hayes on Fox Business Intel uh more on Intel oh working a variety of options uh anyways and

    "MISCELLANEOUS": "\n\n### MISCELLANEOUS\ndown to business\n\n### MISCELLANEOUS\nfinally\n\nthe FED is going to start cutting in September and they are going to be one of the initial immediate beneficiaries well for all those folks out there who do work construction that&#39;s great news for them let&#39;s talk about the data for the labor markets as well clean energy jobs doing well but what&#39;s the overall state of the labor market right now especially given other recent information that shows the US economy simply did not add as many jobs any kind of jobs good jobs or or or however you want to classify it as previous readings yeah that was a big shocker for a lot of people the 800 18,000 downward revision over the year uh what we&#39;re finding though is the Fed has a dual mandate and they&#39;ve now shifted their focus uh they were exclusively F I would say exclusively F focused on inflation they have now shifted and what&#39;s caused them to move is their concerns about the labor market the initial jobless claims that Karina mentioned while it came in better than they are elevated and the FED has their eye on it and that&#39;s why they&#39;re going to go in September because that is a lot harder to recover once it starts falling apart okay we also know wages have coming up in in the past year or so but the price of groceries has gone up 21% the price overall of of goods about 19% but still the economy has been boosted by this consumer spending it comes as a surprise given the prices that I just talked about so what is driving consumers uh is this their confidence out there that we&#39;re going to turn the corner I think there&#39;s something to to that that number one they have jobs number two they are deleveraged if you look at The deleveraging Debt Service as a percentage of disposable income uh it&#39;s really fallen off of a cliff since 2009 it&#39;s come down and down and down the moral of the story is people have a lot less debt they have a lot more cash and albeit there is  a demographic at the lower end that&#39;s starting to struggle and we&#39;re seeing default Spike up and auto loans and things like that by and large 80 some OD perc of the population is doing generally okay but a little bit worried and that&#39;s why the FED is taking a move they don&#39;t want to see layoff start uh there had been some data out two weeks ago that the unemployment rate if you back out the immigration could be as potentially as low as 3.6 3.7% uh it&#39;s the immigration that has uh caused the 4.3% print as of present you know we really can&#39;t talk about all this new data with without talking about the upcoming US election ### MISCELLANEOUS\nKLA Harris has made it clear she really wants to Target price couging uh Donald Trump has been looking overseas uh wants more tariffs especially on China uh coming in what are your thoughts on the US race what are people looking at to distinguish themselves from an economic standpoint from these two candidates well look the name of the game is as as it relates to stock markets and generally the economy is everyone does better when there&#39;s gridlock I.E no one power has no one party has too much power so uh as it relates to uh taxing unrealized capital gains that&#39;s a bad idea if I was going to write a book called How to cause a Great Depression the first chapter one would be entitled let&#39;s start taxing unrealized Capital but isn&#39;t that some but hang on a second isn&#39;t that taken out of context to a degree because as I understand it it&#39;s just aimed at people who have $100 million or more yeah and the people that have $100 million or more are the people who invest in companies that create jobs and if you take away their incentive to invest in companies you&#39;re going to have a lot less jobs so I don&#39;t think that will get through Congress so I don&#39;t think that&#39;s a material thing uh as it relates to Trump on the other hand uh threatening tariffs he did the same thing in his first term what we saw was that Chinese relations uh certainly Chinese stocks did a lot better under the Trump Administration than they did under the Biden Administration uh they actually had one of their worst crashes ever under the Biden Administration so I think the jury is out often times if you make bets based on politic I you lose everyone thought energy stocks would do well under Trump they underperformed they did well under Biden everyone thought solar stocks would go to zero under Trump they actually did quite well they did poorly under Biden so I wouldn&#39;t make your bets on uh politics I would make your bets on the fact that earnings continue to grow estimates are up fif for plus 15% for next year so on balance as long as we have checks and balances and one party does not win all three branches we&#39;re going to be just okay okay Thomas Hayes good stuff is always we can&#39;t thank you enough we appreciate it thank you Sean and we&#39;re back and then\n\nthat&#39;s dropping down to 18 to 20% by by fourth quarter of this year uh and year on year it&#39;ll go from 30% this year to 18% next year at the same time the unmagnify in the first half of this year had negative earnings growth so when people say well why are only seven stocks performing because only seven stocks have meaningful enough earnings growth to perform that is changing that&#39;s now inflecting to positive earnings growth and that&#39;s why you&#39;re starting to see the broadening that&#39;s why you&#39;re starting to see the movement under the surface small caps for instance uh expected to grow 7% earnings growth this year how about 37% earnings growth next year and that is also in line with the first six and 12 months after a f fed cut value outperforms growth in the first six month and small caps outperform large caps by over 11 percentage points in the first 12 months after the first cut from the Federal Reserve that&#39;s some great insights there and I wanted to ask you you know while we&#39;re on that subject within sort of the the small cap space or some of the non-tech sectors is what looks particularly attractive to you I mean is it financials is it industrial something else that you&#39;re watching it&#39;s across the board you know we specialize in turnarounds my nickname is kind of turnaround Tom uh you know one company that&#39;s not a small cap it&#39;s not a dividend pair you know the groups that tend to outperform after the first cut uh we&#39;ve got a weakening dollar we got lower rates so that means uh Emerging Market should do better it means small cap should do better it means dividend payers should do better uh and and it means value should do better and I think one of the stocks that has become a value stock is called uh that we own is called PayPal and and we own it lower from from these levels it&#39;s had a recent move but we think just getting started and the name of the game t\n### MISCELLANEOUS\n\nmargins are reaccelerating and you know he came in and cleared the deck he&#39;s he&#39;s uh uh barely coming on one year and um you know he he basically took took expectations down he said we&#39;re going to do five billion of free cash for we&#39;ll buy back five billion of stock well he just came out this quarter and he said you know that five billion I I I got that wrong we&#39;re actually going to generate billion of free cash flow this year and we&#39;re going to buy $6 billion worth of stock then you got this other business called venmo which is basically the kleenex of peer-to-peer payments that&#39;s growing like a weed they&#39;ve got a a a venmo for teens that&#39;s growing like a weed and there&#39;s a lot to do there so it&#39;s really just the beginning so some of these Fallen Angels uh are really a tremendous opportunity here I I love you brought up the turnaround Tom nickname I&#39;m going to get to that in a second towards the end but I wanted to ask first uh you know you&#39;ve you&#39;ve been a proponent of some looking outside of us borders at some of the cheaper stocks you can find around the world even in a place like China which had fallen out of favor for a long time are we at the point where that you know those types of markets are going to play catchup here if so why and what would you do about it yeah so uh two two things uh 100% dollars weakening yields are coming down that is a magic formula for Emerging Markets I think we&#39;re setting up very close to a situation like 2001 to 2007 where where Tech underperformed we&#39;re not going to crash like we did back then because we they actually have earnings power but underperformed and uh some of these groups outperform as the dollar weakend so uh China we want exposure and look we&#39;ve been bagged in this Alibaba for a year and a half it&#39;s been dead money completely done nothing but uh I think the time is now and alibaba&#39;s proxy for emerging markets but more than that a proxy for China it&#39;s the national champion and something very important just happened the shareholders voted on August 22nd to approve a dual primary listing in Hong Kong that enables it to join the southbound connect on September 9th what does that mean it means for the first time ever mainland China investors and there are 220 million of them they anticipate about 180 million as a potential Market to buy Alibaba stock uh will be able to buy Alibaba stock for the first time ever starting September 9th what&#39;s more important than that is that alibaba&#39;s got about 80 billion dollars of cash on their balance sheet and rather than they couldn&#39;t get that cash out of China to do buyback so they would have to issue non-dilutive convertible uh stock uh in order to get US dollars to buy the stock back back even though they had $80 billion sitting at home they will now be able to buy back stock through the southbound connect and you see just in the last few days since that dual primary listing was approved uh that they&#39;re reporting how much stock that they&#39;re buying back and we&#39;re going to see that accelerate so I think look uh you know everyone feels that China&#39;s uninvestable but if you look at the Hang sang for the last 20 years you have these huge Corrections every two to four years and uh the bigger the correction the longer it takes usually takes about two years to build the base but when it turns and it starts to move up it tends to be parabolic and you know you got to keep in mind through all the noise the country is still growing at 5% GDP and and here we are American exceptionalism no question about it but we&#39;re growing at two and a half percent. so there&#39;s opportunity there they will recover and I think demographically speaking they&#39;ve got another huge parabolic run before maybe they do run out of time three to five years out like Japan did in the late 80s because they didn&#39;t make enough babies for for so long but for now they&#39;ve got a huge portion of their population age 34 and their spending should should increase and uh Peak out at around age 40 got it Tom uh you&#39;re gonna be joining us for the 24 money Show Master Symposium in Sarasota this December um you know we talked about this sort of turnaround approach I just want to know when it comes to methodology why do you find that style of investing so attractive and what do you think people were looking look to be value investors or turnaround investors need to know when it comes to pointers or advice well number one uh a stock that falls 90% can fall another 50% before you get a five bagger so so it&#39;s uh uh there&#39;s something to be said there but what we like is we&#39;re we&#39;re not predict the next great thing people we are buying durable business that have been down around through many cycles and have have had multiple turnaround situations and have proven they have a durable Mo so even when the stock&#39;s down 60 or 80% or whatever it happens to be when we&#39;re getting involved we we&#39;re looking and we&#39;re seeing okay well the free cash flow and the revenues are kind of holding in there or in some cases they might might be down modestly they&#39;re not down 80% that I can assure you uh revenues are usually flat are growing and uh and free cash flow is usually positive and then you get some Catalyst with a new CEO that has talent to take this beautiful Legacy franchise that has been through multiple cycle Cycles over decades and turn it turn it back into something great and we like it because uh the margin of safety is much greater once we have comfort with the balance sheet Etc that we can make a double or triple in a handful of years versus uh business that&#39;s already up quite a bit you know we we had talked about uh you may have caught our note in uh June of this year when we said envidia was the new pain trade you can look it up on the website it was like June 22nd that day uh it opened at 136 it went up to 140 against us and has since Fallen about 30 40% uh because you know it&#39;s a great business but at $3.2 trillion valuation when you have a a total GDP of 28 trillion and an expected growth rate from the sell side of 40% a year what they&#39;re basically trying to convince you is that it&#39;s going to be half of GDP in four years which is absolutely makes no sense if you&#39;re interested and believe in something called math so um you know so those are the type of things that we avoid and uh and and other things that we can have a sense of certainty two three years out we can make a double or triple if it&#39;s a smaller business sometimes we can make a multibagger got it got it well just one last question I guess um you know beyond what we&#39;ve talked about here any other sneak peek or uh you know tidbits about what you think you might be talking about in Sarasota I know December&#39;s still a few months off so it&#39;s a little bit tough who knows what the market will do between now and then all I can tell you is in the unmagnify there are tremendous opportunities still that have been created by once in a 100y year event called covid and these are durable multi-decade franchises so we&#39;re going to talk about a few of our ideas for 2025 we&#39;re very excited about that we&#39;re going to talk about our General Market Outlook and we&#39;re gonna have a lot of fun well Tom listen thank you so much for your advice and your insights here viewers if you&#39;re watching and you want to learn more from Tom he is going to be joining us at that money Show Master and osum in Sarasota it runs December 5th to 7th at the Hiatt regeny Sarasota here in sunny Southwest Florida if you&#39;ve been to this part of the country uh in December you know how great the weather is going to be it&#39;s going to be a wonderful time uh enjoy the outside enjoy the knowledge you&#39;re going to get inside and learn from experts like Tom so uh click the link below look at the description if you need some more details and Tom I look forward to seeing you there in a couple of months thanks Mike and one finals Tom caveat opinion not advice thanks so much for having me got it sounds good take care Tom [Music] bye-bye [Music] and I want to go through couple of things now that we&#39;ve uh as many of you have been following us uh we bought a lot of uh Amazon in October of uh 2022 and then again in March of uh 2023 that has more than double we took off a uh the majority of the position in uh July as we talked about on the podcast and we&#39;ve taken off the rest of the position uh in um in the last week so you know Blended out of the thing somewhere around 190 and we got in down here so that&#39;s more than a double in a year and a half and some of these things uh you know they like like this one only took you know B basically a year and a half some of these work really really fast and others work more slowly and that&#39;s the name of the game well let&#39;s to look at anothers that we harvested we talked that we had sold out of uh um uh Bank of America I mean this was nearly a double off the lows uh and we took off the final 25% around 40 so Blended you know 401 two three range uh and that&#39;s not quite a double from the lows but that was a good trade and then city were fully out of uh this was a monster lows were 36 in change um uh we had some in the 30s some in the low 40s and um took off most of that and took off the rest this week at you know in the around 60 so that was close to a double and again these are this one was less than a year or or just a little bit over a year rather and you know whether it&#39;s so you just see over and over the framework works sometimes it takes longer sometimes okay now Google is one that we took off the majority of the position again in July perfectly timed right after we put that article out on Nvidia where we said uh the next pain trade and we had the picture of Jensen Wong signing some fans uh breast with his signature and and the stock that day opened at 136 went to 139 it since collapsed close to 100 it&#39;s bouncing around the bottom um so we got R out of most of Google at that we we still have that 25 30% tiny small stub in Google we&#39;re not going to sell Down in the Hole here but on the next strength up to 170 180 maybe it makes new highs if we get a rally into the the uh first cut but I doubt it uh will&#39;ll probably extinguish the rest of that position so again you see here late October 2022 and then again in March of 2023 when it was down at 90 you know got up to 190 when we were talking about it in July uh 180 and now it&#39;s at 160 again no matter where you slice it more than a double year and a half the framework continues to work uh smtc entered below 20 we took off the full position uh with a for handle some in July some in the last week uh same with uh C limited the reason we took this one off that one has gone from 32 uh lows to 83 and change uh we don&#39;t like the business enough and we have enough exposure to Asia e-commerce through Alibaba so we just booked that and then uh 3M we already told you uh this has been a monster we took we got out of this at 125 it went up to 135 now it&#39;s back to 130 uh would we consider reing this below 100 yes may we get that opportunity we don&#39;t know but again this is a huge move in a relatively short period of time and you book The win so the framework works over and over and over and sometimes it goes against you before it goes for you as a matter of fact every time it goes against you before it goes for you if you&#39;re doing a good job and um so so just some updates there now we&#39;ve got a tremendous amount of data and now we&#39;ve got our new batch that are bouncing around the lows and they&#39;re going to be our next batch of harvesting in the next year year and a half we&#39;re going to be doing this type of stuff for those of you who&#39;ve been following along and it&#39;s just going to work I mean 3M looked like it would never work in a million years by the way we still own all the svent that we got for free uh so that&#39;s exciting for for that and um all right so uh sentiment survey D data this came in at 45% bullish 24% bearish so look there&#39;s some bullishness it&#39;s being taken out of the market I think the look it all comes down to the jobs report I think the jobs report is going to come in uh week enough for to to to give people no doubt in their mind that the fed&#39;s going at least 25 possibly 50 I don&#39;t think they go 50 as I talked about with Mike because um he doesn&#39;t want to shock the market but I mean if it was unbelievably weak they might do 50 that would probably not be good for the market I think it&#39;s going to be um Goldilocks not too hot not too cold enough to guarantee the 25 and if that&#39;s turns out to be correct tomorrow and maybe the unemployment rate goes from 43 to 42 as as expected um we get the 25 it looks like the world&#39;s not falling apart and I think we probably see Equity strength into the first cut uh which would be a week and a half two weeks of super strength to suck every last person back in until we fall into some serious seasonal weakness both from an election year standpoint and a sell sell the news so uh we will use any of that strength to raise some more cash from some of our winners uh and be ready to either tactically hedge or have that catch ready to deploy in late October early November right before we get the election uh uh clearing up and end of year monster rally is our expectation uh auto sales volume thanks to Allen over there you know \n\n\nupdates there now we've got a tremendous amount of data and now we've got our new batch that are bouncing around the lows and they're going to be our next batch of harvesting in the next year year and a half we're going to be doing this type of stuff for those of you who've been following along and it's just going to work I mean 3M looked like it would never work in a million years by the way we still own all the svent that we got for free uh so that's exciting for for that and um all right so uh sentiment survey D data this came in at 45%

mean if it was unbelievably weak they might do 50 that would probably not be good for the market I think it's going to be um Goldilocks not too hot not too cold enough to guarantee the 25 and if that's turns out to be correct tomorrow and maybe the unemployment rate goes from 43 to 42 as as expected um we get the 25 it looks like the world's not falling apart and I think we probably see Equity strength into the first cut uh which would be a week and a half two weeks of super strength to suck every last person back in until we fall into some serious seasonal weakness both from an election year standpoint and a sell sell the news so uh we will use any of that strength to raise some more cash from some of our winners uh and be ready to either tactically hedge or have that catch ready to deploy in late October early November right before we get the election uh uh clearing up and end of year monster rally is our expectation uh auto sales volume thanks to Allen over there you know uhhere is  August numbers uh we're really uh August numbers to be announced so they they have been moving you know they were at 158 I think they're at 151 now which is not ideal but what do we have happening we have rates having rates coming down uh starting in um 20 starting in two weeks and you have incentives going up and as we move to the end of the year because of all the EV inventories and all that stuff they're going to just fire sale it start doing 10 15 10 12% incentives certainly on the EVs and probably 8 9% incentives on the regular cars which means in in round terms a $50,000 car is going to cost you $45,000 and rates are going to be lower and they're going to incentivize that in anticipation of maybe 100 basis points lower uh so you know you could see a situation where as we move towards the end of the year you see a lot of uh uh car ads that look something like this MSRP 50,000 5,000 incentives net 45,000 2.9% APR and that's going to get people off the couch that's going to get a lot of uh uh inventories flush through and that's going to get production ramping back up which is what we need to see to get the operating leverage humming in Cooper standard which we will US market breath is improving relative performance S&P equal weighted index has risen from the lows uh that's why a lot of these names have been big winners for us and we are going to uh look at that City chart that's amazing uh and we have harvested those ### MISCELLANEOUS\n3M I mean it's it's uh it's it's exciting to see th those working and I'm more excited to see the ones that we have are going to be much bigger uh in aggregate than than uh even those election years are different average Dow Jones Industrial monthly return since 1896 uh don't love going back to 1896 because the post pre-World War II data tends to be skewed however what they're implying\n\nwe have rates coming down uh starting in um 20 starting in two weeks and you have incentives going up and as we move to the end of the year because of all the EV inventories and all that stuff they&#39;re going to just fire sale it start doing 10 15 10 12% incentives certainly on the EVs and probably 8 9% incentives on the regular cars which means in in round terms a $50,000 car is going to cost you $45,000 and rates are going to be lower and they&#39;re going to incentivize that in anticipation of maybe 100 basis points lower uh so you know you could see a situation where as we move towards the end of the year you see a lot of uh car ads that look something like this MSRP 50,000 5,000

which is what we need to see to get the operating leverage humming in Cooper standard which we will US market breath is improving relative performance S&P equal weighted index has risen from the lows uh that&#39;s why a lot of these names have been big winners for us and we are going to uh look at that City chart that&#39;s amazing uh and we have harvested those 3M\n### MISCELLANEOUS\nthat in all years including election year September is uh 1% on average in election years it&#39;s better than um uh uh it&#39;s a positive month barely a positive month but a positive month uh so so that&#39;s that okay what 2024 looks like a lot like 2023 that&#39;s from Dietrich over at Carson I don&#39;t think that&#39;s really relevant but it it does look similar in which case it would be weakness into the end of October which is our base case followed by super uh strong year end rally I just think we&#39;re going to see a little bit of strength before that first cut and the Catalyst will probably be my guess is tomorrow&#39;s jobs report so",
    "MEDIA_APPEARANCE_RECAP": "\n\n### MEDIA_APPEARANCE_RECAP\nrelations uh certainly Chinese stocks did a lot better under the Trump Administration than they did under the Biden Administration uh they actually had one of their worst crashes ever under the Biden Administration so I think the jury is out often times if you make bets based on politic I you lose everyone thought energy stocks would do well under Trump they underperformed they did well under Biden everyone thought solar stocks would go to zero under Trump they actually did quite well they did poorly under Biden so I wouldn&#39;t make your bets on uh politics I would make your bets on the fact that earnings continue to grow estimates are up fif for plus 15% for next year so on balance as long as we have checks and balances and one party does not win all three branches we&#39;re going to be just okay okay\n### MEDIA_APPEARANCE_RECAP\nI think we&#39;re setting up very close to a situation like 2001 to 2007 where where Tech underperformed we&#39;re not going to crash like we did back then because we they actually have earnings power but underperformed and uh some of these groups outperform as the dollar [Music] weakend hello and welcome to our latest money show Money Masters podcast segment Mike Larson editor-in Chief at money show 2024 has been a strong year for the stock market we&#39;re seeing a lot more volatility in August and September today we have a huge list of potential Market catalysts right around the corner that includes the first likely Federal Reserve interest rate cut in four plus years and of course the upcoming presidential election joining me to cut through the Clutter and give you some actional opinions about what is likely to happen is Tom Hayes Tom is founder chairman and managing member of great Hill Capital as well as the man behind the informative and entertaining Market commentary site hedge fund tips Tom how are you I&#39;m doing great good to good to be with you Mike yeah I&#39;m glad to have you here I mean gez a lot going on in the market so I guess I kind of have to start with the most obvious question right is September going to be one of those moments where we all want to run and hide or do you think this seasonally weak period for markets talk is a littleit overblown you know it&#39;s interesting uh when everyone&#39;s looking for correction is when you usually don&#39;t get it you know we we&#39;ve been of the view that it could get a little choppy in late September and early October I think the I think the potential surprise here Mike uh is that the jobs report should come in in a fashion on Friday that will cement the FED doing obviously the 25 basis points and maybe 50 basis points but more likely 25 no matter how bad the jobs report is on Friday and we&#39;ve got two coincident factors number one is the election year seasonality if you look back to World War II uh it tends to actually be markets tend to be strong into mid September not September 1st midt uh that doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s going to work uh exactly that way this year but the other thing that we notice is when a Fed starts the easing cycle the first cut has a high propensity to be a buy the rumor sell the news so our base case is actually that we start to see some strength into that first cut so you know maybe yesterday and today being a oneoff uh the short-term volatility we get the jobs report people start to look forward to the cut and maybe we even touch you know we did with the Dow or relook at near New highs on the S&amp;P and then we move into that normal pre-election Jitters from late September through the end of October which will be an opportunity to buy into a yearend rally uh that is fostered by a hopeful gridlock outcome irrespective of who&#39;s elected not having one power with absolute one party with absolute control is the key for the stock market got it got it well let&#39;s talk a little bit about the the fed and kind of the economic news I mean as we&#39;re speaking we just got a pretty lousy looking jolts report you know we won&#39;t have the NFP by the time this this airs um but we&#39;ve seen some some squishier softer numbers not terribly recessionary in my opinion uh of late so how do you think that you know the FED reacts what do you see them doing again in September and maybe as we roll into the final couple of meetings here in 2024 yeah I I you know Jay Powell has a history of not liking to shock markets I think he learned that early on in December of 2018 when he said autopilot and by Christmas Eve everyone was wondering if uh the stock market was going to fall through the floor it fell something like 19% like overnight uh I was at Disneyland looking at my cell phone like what the hell is he doing uh and fortunately uh minutian stepped in and got the banks together and and recovered everything so since then he tends to avoid major surprises and um in that on that basis I think he&#39;s going to do 25 even if the jobs report is weak and from there uh we could see uh the Market&#39;s pricing in a 100 this year I don&#39;t know you know that would kind of concern me in the sense that if they do a 50 cut maybe the economy is a little worse than everyone expects maybe it&#39;s not a soft Landing so base case is actually uh more conservative 50 to 75 I think 75 probably gets done 25 2525 uh and then we see where it is uh in you know 2025 got it you know one of the things obviously I follow your work at hedge fund tips it&#39;s fantastic everybody who&#39;s watching this please make sure you sign up for some of that commentary because it&#39;s very insightful and enjoyable one thing I know you&#39;ve been talking about there and elsew\n\nmargins are reaccelerating and you know he came in and cleared the deck he&#39;s he&#39;s uh uh barely coming on one year and um you know he he basically took took expectations down he said we&#39;re going to do five billion of free cash for we&#39;ll buy back five billion of stock well he just came out this quarter and he said you know that five billion I I I got that wrong we&#39;re actually going to generate billion of free cash flow this year and we&#39;re going to buy $6 billion worth of stock then you got this other business called venmo which is basically the kleenex of peer-to-peer payments that&#39;s growing like a weed they&#39;ve got a a a venmo for teens that&#39;s growing like a weed and there&#39;s a lot to do there so it&#39;s really just the beginning so some of these Fallen Angels uh are really a tremendous opportunity here I I love you brought up the turnaround Tom nickname I&#39;m going to get to that in a second towards the end but I wanted to ask first uh you know you&#39;ve you&#39;ve been a proponent of some looking outside of us borders at some of the cheaper stocks you can find around the world even in a place like China which had fallen out of favor for a long time are we at the point where that you know those types of markets are going to play catchup here if so why and what would you do about it yeah so uh two two things uh 100% dollars weakening yields are coming down that is a magic formula for Emerging Markets I think we&#39;re setting up very close to a situation like 2001 to 2007 where where Tech underperformed we&#39;re not going to crash like we did back then because we they actually have earnings power but underperformed and uh some of these groups outperform as the dollar weakend so uh China we want exposure and look we&#39;ve been bagged in this Alibaba for a year and a half it&#39;s been dead money completely done nothing but uh I think the time is now and alibaba&#39;s proxy for emerging markets but more than that a proxy for China it&#39;s the national champion and something very important just happened the shareholders voted on August 22nd to approve a dual primary listing in Hong Kong that enables it to join the southbound connect on September 9th what does that mean it means for the first time ever mainland China investors and there are 220 million of them they anticipate about 180 million as a potential Market to buy Alibaba stock uh will be able to buy Alibaba stock for the first time ever starting September 9th what&#39;s more important than that is that alibaba&#39;s got about 80 billion dollars of cash on their balance sheet and rather than they couldn&#39;t get that cash out of China to do buyback so they would have to issue non-dilutive convertible uh stock uh in order to get US dollars to buy the stock back back even though they had $80 billion sitting at home they will now be able to buy back stock through the southbound connect and you see just in the last few days since that dual primary listing was approved uh that they&#39;re reporting how much stock that they&#39;re buying back and we&#39;re going to see that accelerate so I think look uh you know everyone feels that China&#39;s uninvestable but if you look at the Hang sang for the last 20 years you have these huge Corrections every two to four years and uh the bigger the correction the longer it takes usually takes about two years to build the base but when it turns and it starts to move up it tends to be parabolic and you know you got to keep in mind through all the noise the country is still growing at 5% GDP and and here we are American exceptionalism no question about it but we&#39;re growing at two and a half percent. so there&#39;s opportunity there they will recover and I think demographically speaking they&#39;ve got another huge parabolic run before maybe they do run out of time three to five years out like Japan did in the late 80s because they didn&#39;t make enough babies for for so long but for now they&#39;ve got a huge portion of their population age 34 and their spending should should increase and uh Peak out at around age 40 got it Tom uh you&#39;re gonna be joining us for the 24 money Show Master Symposium in Sarasota this December um you know we talked about this sort of turnaround approach I just want to know when it comes to methodology why do you find that style of investing so attractive and what do you think people were looking look to be value investors or turnaround investors need to know when it comes to pointers or advice well number one uh a stock that falls 90% can fall another 50% before you get a five bagger so so it&#39;s uh uh there&#39;s something to be said there but what we like is we&#39;re we&#39;re not predict the next great thing people we are buying durable business that have been down around through many cycles and have have had multiple turnaround situations and have proven they have a durable Mo so even when the stock&#39;s down 60 or 80% or whatever it happens to be when we&#39;re getting involved we we&#39;re looking and we&#39;re seeing okay well the free cash flow and the revenues are kind of holding in there or in some cases they might might be down modestly they&#39;re not down 80% that I can assure you uh revenues are usually flat are growing and uh and free cash flow is usually positive and then you get some Catalyst with a new CEO that has talent to take this beautiful Legacy franchise that has been through multiple cycle Cycles over decades and turn it turn it back into something great and we like it because uh the margin of safety is much greater once we have comfort with the balance sheet Etc that we can make a double or triple in a handful of years versus uh business that&#39;s already up quite a bit you know we we had talked about uh you may have caught our note in uh June of this year when we said envidia was the new pain trade you can look it up on the website it was like June 22nd that day uh it opened at 136 it went up to 140 against us and has since Fallen about 30 40% uh because you know it&#39;s a great business but at $3.2 trillion valuation when you have a a total GDP of 28 trillion and an expected growth rate from the sell side of 40% a year what they&#39;re basically trying to convince you is that it&#39;s going to be half of GDP in four years which is absolutely makes no sense if you&#39;re interested and believe in something called math so um you know so those are the type of things that we avoid and uh and and other things that we can have a sense of certainty two three years out we can make a double or triple if it&#39;s a smaller business sometimes we can make a multibagger got it got it well just one last question I guess um you know beyond what we&#39;ve talked about here any other sneak peek or uh you know tidbits about what you think you might be talking about in Sarasota I know December&#39;s still a few months off so it&#39;s a little bit tough who knows what the market will do between now and then all I can tell you is in the unmagnify there are tremendous opportunities still that have been created by once in a 100y year event called covid and these are durable multi-decade franchises so we&#39;re going to talk about a few of our ideas for 2025 we&#39;re very excited about that we&#39;re going to talk about our General Market Outlook and we&#39;re gonna have a lot of fun well Tom listen thank you so much for your advice and your insights here viewers if you&#39;re watching and you want to learn more from Tom he is going to be joining us at that money Show Master and osum in Sarasota it runs December 5th to 7th at the Hiatt regeny Sarasota here in sunny Southwest Florida if you&#39;ve been to this part of the country uh in December you know how great the weather is going to be it&#39;s going to be a wonderful time uh enjoy the outside enjoy the knowledge you&#39;re going to get inside and learn from experts like Tom so uh click the link below look at the description if you need some more details and Tom I look forward to seeing you there in a couple of months thanks Mike and one finals Tom caveat opinion not advice thanks so much for having me got it sounds good take care Tom [Music] bye-bye [Music] and I want to go through couple of things now that we&#39;ve uh as many of you have been following us uh we bought a lot of uh Amazon in October of uh 2022 and then again in March of uh 2023 that has more than double we took off a uh the majority of the position in uh July as we talked about on the podcast and we&#39;ve taken off the rest of the position uh in um in the last week so you know Blended out of the thing somewhere around 190 and we got in down here so that&#39;s more than a double in a year and a half and some of these things uh you know they like like this one only took you know B basically a year and a half some of these work really really fast and others work more slowly and that&#39;s the name of the game well let&#39;s to look at anothers that we harvested we talked that we had sold out of uh um uh Bank of America I mean this was nearly a double off the lows uh and we took off the final 25% around 40 so Blended you know 401 two three range uh and that&#39;s not quite a double from the lows but that was a good trade and then city were fully out of uh this was a monster lows were 36 in change um uh we had some in the 30s some in the low 40s and um took off most of that and took off the rest this week at you know in the around 60 so that was close to a double and again these are this one was less than a year or or just a little bit over a year rather and you know whether it&#39;s so you just see over and over the framework works sometimes it takes longer sometimes okay now Google is one that we took off the majority of the position again in July perfectly timed right after we put that article out on Nvidia where we said uh the next pain trade and we had the picture of Jensen Wong signing some fans uh breast with his signature and and the stock that day opened at 136 went to 139 it since collapsed close to 100 it&#39;s bouncing around the bottom um so we got R out of most of Google at that we we still have that 25 30% tiny small stub in Google we&#39;re not going to sell Down in the Hole here but on the next strength up to 170 180 maybe it makes new highs if we get a rally into the the uh first cut but I doubt it uh will&#39;ll probably extinguish the rest of that position so again you see here late October 2022 and then again in March of 2023 when it was down at 90 you know got up to 190 when we were talking about it in July uh 180 and now it&#39;s at 160 again no matter where you slice it more than a double year and a half the framework continues to work uh smtc entered below 20 we took off the full position uh with a for handle some in July some in the last week uh same with uh C limited the reason we took this one off that one has gone from 32 uh lows to 83 and change uh we don&#39;t like the business enough and we have enough exposure to Asia e-commerce through Alibaba so we just booked that and then uh 3M we already told you uh this has been a monster we took we got out of this at 125 it went up to 135 now it&#39;s back to 130 uh would we consider reing this below 100 yes may we get that opportunity we don&#39;t know but again this is a huge move in a relatively short period of time and you book The win so the framework works over and over and over and sometimes it goes against you before it goes for you as a matter of fact every time it goes against you before it goes for you if you&#39;re doing a good job and um so so just some updates there now we&#39;ve got a tremendous amount of data and now we&#39;ve got our new batch that are bouncing around the lows and they&#39;re going to be our next batch of harvesting in the next year year and a half we&#39;re going to be doing this type of stuff for those of you who&#39;ve been following along and it&#39;s just going to work I mean 3M looked like it would never work in a million years by the way we still own all the svent that we got for free uh so that&#39;s exciting for for that and um all right so uh sentiment survey D data this came in at 45% bullish 24% bearish so look there&#39;s some bullishness it&#39;s being taken out of the market I think the look it all comes down to the jobs report I think the jobs report is going to come in uh week enough for to to to give people no doubt in their mind that the fed&#39;s going at least 25 possibly 50 I don&#39;t think they go 50 as I talked about with Mike because um he doesn&#39;t want to shock the market but I mean if it was unbelievably weak they might do 50 that would probably not be good for the market I think it&#39;s going to be um Goldilocks not too hot not too cold enough to guarantee the 25 and if that&#39;s turns out to be correct tomorrow and maybe the unemployment rate goes from 43 to 42 as as expected um we get the 25 it looks like the world&#39;s not falling apart and I think we probably see Equity strength into the first cut uh which would be a week and a half two weeks of super strength to suck every last person back in until we fall into some serious seasonal weakness both from an election year standpoint and a sell sell the news so uh we will use any of that strength to raise some more cash from some of our winners uh and be ready to either tactically hedge or have that catch ready to deploy in late October early November right before we get the election uh uh clearing up and end of year monster rally is our expectation uh auto sales volume thanks to Allen over there you know \n",

everybody who&#39;s watching this please make sure you sign up for some of that commentary because it&#39;s very insightful and enjoyable one thing I know you&#39;ve been talking about there and elsewhere is  the rotation that we&#39;ve seen in this market for the last couple of months right I mean it was an alltech all the time market for a while since July that&#39;s been changing what do you think&#39;s going on there and what do you think that means going forward I think it&#39;s very very healthy the market is broadening out and it&#39;s not just some hope like we&#39;ve had some fake outs in the past this time it&#39;s actually uh backstopped and substantiated by the trends in earnings you know you had the Magnificent Seven earnings growth in the first quarter of this year was 50% uh that&#39;s dropping down to 18 to 20% by by fourth quarter of this year uh and year on year it&#39;ll go from 30% this year to 18% next year at the same time the unmagnify in the first half of this year had negative earnings growth so when people say well why are only seven stocks performing because only seven stocks have meaningful enough earnings growth to perform that is changing that&#39;s now inflecting to positive earnings growth and that&#39;s why you&#39;re starting to see the broadening that&#39;s why you&#39;re starting to see the movement under the surface small caps for instance uh expected to grow 7% earnings growth this year how about 37% earnings growth next year and that is also in line with the first six and 12 months after a f fed cut value outperforms growth in the first six month and small caps outperform large caps by over 11 percentage points in the first 12 months after the first cut from the Federal Reserve that&#39;s some great insights there and I wanted to ask you you know while we&#39;re on that subject within sort of the the small cap space or some of the non-tech sectors is what looks particularly attractive to you I mean is it financials is it industrial something else that you&#39;re watching it&#39;s across the board you know we specialize in turnarounds my nickname is kind of turnaround Tom uh you know one company that&#39;s not a small cap it&#39;s not a dividend pair you know the groups that tend to outperform after the first cut uh we&#39;ve got a weakening dollar we got lower rates so that means uh Emerging Market should do better it means small cap should do better it means dividend payers should do better uh and and it means value should do better and I think one of the stocks that has become a value stock is called uh that we own is called PayPal and and we own it lower from from these levels it&#39;s had a recent move but we think just getting started and the name of the game t\n\n### MACRO_DATA_SLIDES\nhere is more seasonality from 1976 through 2023 this is a presidential year and you do see a big popup here into uh mid to late September before the rollover into late October prior to the election and that is more in line with how we're thinking about it let's see what happens August does well in election years yeah we know that but uh so what they're saying\n\nSeptember uh is a little weaker and that would be correct uh that also allows for the rally in late September and then a rollover before the end of the month which is what we like here&#39;s more good data from Carson this shows that that you do get this like early weakness and uncertainty and then a rally oddly into the 19th the FED meeting I believe is the 17th so this would be a natural moving back up to highs uh and then you just roll over after the 19th which um which is kind of how we&#39;re thinking about it does that mean we sell everything risk on risk off of course not most of our stuff uh now that we new new positions that we&#39;ve been able to put on it&#39;s so cheap it probably rallies when the market gets gets weak uh because money has to go somewhere as it rotates out of the mag 7 which will cause the market to uh to be weak in October because of the waiting GDP revisions from initial percentage uh consumer spending was the big thing that revised GDP up to 2.5% so everyone&#39;s saying that the uh GDP uh the consumer&#39;s dead it&#39;s not fully reflected I think in the case of you know the companies that have been hit Dollar General Dollar Tree Advanced Auto Parts by the way uh for sure uh by the lower-end consumer I think that was largely due to mismanagement the difference between Advanced Auto Parts and Dollar General and Dollar Tree is Advanced Auto Parts has a new jockey that&#39;s turning it around and they what&#39;s comical about the way the stock is acting right now and we&#39;ve taken advantage of it uh is that what um Shane o Kelly did in the last few weeks by selling off world pack is he took solvy risk off the table in other words bankruptcy is off the table okay and the stock was down from whatever 250 down to 60 or 50 now it&#39;s in the 40s um uh what with comp store sales Rising by the way and they&#39;re going to be using that money not just to pay down the debt which takes solvency risk off the table but to start to grow 100 new stores a year get back growth uh they&#39;ve they&#39;ve stabilized the existing business the market didn&#39;t like the soft guidance for the next two quarters same as Disney they didn&#39;t like the soft guidance for the next two quarters same as Dollar General same as Dollar Tree but it&#39;s temporary not permanent and don&#39;t count out this consumer as long as the fed&#39;s not too late and we believe so long as they go the 25 uh my our base case is 25 25 25 I would not be surprised if we do 75 to 100 and even though inflation is only you know is is much lower I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if they don&#39;t have to do more than 75 or 100 because I think inflation is going to oscillate between two and four and four and a half% for the next three to five years and they could probably hold the FED funds at 350 to four and get away with it um and that&#39;s the environment actually that value does well as well so um consumer spending contribution to GDP growth Services good look oh this is really interesting ladies and gentlemen this is what I was talking about dstock restock Goods demand is coming back and normalizing uh after it went negative in the first quarter it&#39;s back so that was our trough base case which was in fourth quarter of last year initial jobl claims climbing up that&#39;s why the FED is taking action uh let&#39;s see here yeah consumer spending still a big part of it S&P monthly returns going back to 1928 again this really pre-World War II data is not terribly helped full uh with September being the worst month that&#39;s from the mly flu full down 1.17% on average US pending home sales at historic lows what&#39;s going to change very quickly to change that is you know here&#39;s the thing a lot of people have an enormous amount of equity Boomers trapped in their houses and they can&#39;t get out because they don&#39;t want to trade a 3% mortgage for a 7% mortgage well what&#39;s going to happen is mortgage rates are going to go in drop into a five handle pretty damn quickly maybe it&#39;s 5&#39;9 it doesn&#39;t matter it&#39;s it&#39;s uh psychological with the 5% and while they weren&#39;t willing to do 7% they&#39;re going to be willing to trade 3 to five particularly if they book a seven fig profit on a house that they bought for you know an apple pie and two slices of ice cream 40 years ago is now worth a couple mil and maybe they&#39;ve taken a million of equity out at 3% and they can book a Mill and then buy a townhouse for a mill cash or or or or Finance one at five and change and uh and uh invest the the mill of profits uh and live happily ever after so the thing where I think they&#39;re going to get hurt that most of them don&#39;t realize is that as rates go down I think there&#39;s going to be a mad rush of supply pushed on the market massive amount of supply and for those who think well my my price is going to go even higher as rates go down because it trades like a bond I think they&#39;re going to be uh surprised that um uh they&#39;re going to have an enormous amount of competition with so many houses coming on all at once us pending home sales tumbled a record low in July that&#39;s going to change very quickly Japanese CPI going back up which means boj going to be hiking which means Yen going higher Juan going higher dollar going lower Japanese equities probably going lower Chinese Yuan strongest against the dollar since the beginning of the year moving in the right direction this is what we see when Chinese equities start going going up Chinese exports up 2.6% since October 2023 where it&#39;s going to the rest of the world they are much lower to the us but they are holding steady to the rest of the world so the rest of the world benefits from their sweat shops while we are not benefiting as much um that&#39;s a little bit of an exaggeration but I also think that&#39;s probably related to believe it or not automobiles we&#39;re not allowing Chinese cars in the US anytime soon uh so um and you know Germany&#39;s shutting down factories because they&#39;re letting the Chinese cars in so we&#39;ll see what happens there I think they&#39;re going to be a lot more tariffs coming to a theater nearu against the Chinese cars uh economic grievances fuel protests in China this is what we need to see to cause a bazooka type stimulus and we&#39;re going to talk we&#39;re

$500 billion do of backlog let&#39;s start a new product you can&#39;t make this stuff up and furthermore let&#39;s raise $30 billion of equity and dude our shareholders for a product that we

are grateful for your service please write several more notes so we can add more size at lower prices and number six total company backlog is $516 billion including over 5,400 commercial airplanes for those worried about the quote health of Boeing may I offer you the world&#39;s smallest violin they&#39;ll be just fine only a matter of when not if and we scroll up so you can see the world&#39;s smallest violin moving on key catalyst is the new CEO Kelly ortberg who started on August 8th as CEO of Rockwell Collins he doubled sales in six years and quadrupled 4x the value of the company for shareholders before selling it at a price premium to United Technologies in 2019 um and so on so then we go into a nice report from Morning Star I like morning star&#39;s framework because they&#39;re all Buffet ties if you go out to the annual meetings they&#39;re always there they have a good investment framework and I you know we&#39;re running 112 all right we could go through some of these points but you can read it on your own the key here is  that there are only two players in town they have 99% of the market there&#39;s a Chinese player that&#39;s uh their their planes go Boeing&#39;s planes go 75% further they don&#39;t compete on any metric so they&#39;ll sell a bunch of crappy planes to their own Chinese Airlines no one outside of China is going to buy a Chinese airplane that I can guarantee you and even the ones inside if they want to be competitive they got to have Boeing and Airbus so uh um the Chinese company will maybe take if they&#39;re lucky uh let&#39;s see arj21 that&#39;s a company called comac they&#39;ve been trying to do this for 10 15 years Chinese carrier uh carriers took delivery of 30 almost 30 aircraft per month on average we have no reason to believe that ramping up the larger and more complex c919 will be an easier process than ramping up arj which has taken them you know 15 plus years and um the 737 Max 7 for instance can travel roughly 75% more nautical miles than than comx similar size c919 and the economics Drive Airline purchase decisions in some the technical complexity of aircraft manufacturing is a material barrier to entry which we believe constitutes intangible Boeing and Airbus are the only two capable suppliers of globally competitive aircraft larger than 130 seats and we don&#39;t see any Global competitive new entrance entering the market anytime soon therefore we believe it&#39;s reasonable to assume that almost all Global demand for new air CL will flow through the income statement of a comment incumbents that we conc that some Chinese demand will likely move toward com back um Market is large enough and unders supplied enough to support two wide modes we built a 20-year aviation

    "FEATURED_COMPANY_DEEP_DIVES": "\n\nmargins are reaccelerating and you know he came in and cleared the deck he&#39;s he&#39;s uh uh barely coming on one year and um you know he he basically took took expectations down he said we&#39;re going to do five billion of free cash for we&#39;ll buy back five billion of stock well he just came out this quarter and he said you know that five billion I I I got that wrong we&#39;re actually going to generate billion of free cash flow this year and we&#39;re going to buy $6 billion worth of stock then you got this other business called venmo which is basically the kleenex of peer-to-peer payments that&#39;s growing like a weed they&#39;ve got a a a venmo for teens that&#39;s growing like a weed and there&#39;s a lot to do there so it&#39;s really just the beginning so some of these Fallen Angels uh are really a tremendous opportunity here I I love you brought up the turnaround Tom nickname I&#39;m going to get to that in a second towards the end but I wanted to ask first uh you know you&#39;ve you&#39;ve been a proponent of some looking outside of us borders at some of the cheaper stocks you can find around the world even in a place like China which had fallen out of favor for a long time are we at the point where that you know those types of markets are going to play catchup here if so why and what would you do about it yeah so uh two two things uh 100% dollars weakening yields are coming down that is a magic formula for Emerging Markets I think we&#39;re setting up very close to a situation like 2001 to 2007 where where Tech underperformed we&#39;re not going to crash like we did back then because we they actually have earnings power but underperformed and uh some of these groups outperform as the dollar weakend so uh China we want exposure and look we&#39;ve been bagged in this Alibaba for a year and a half it&#39;s been dead money completely done nothing but uh I think the time is now and alibaba&#39;s proxy for emerging markets but more than that a proxy for China it&#39;s the national champion and something very important just happened the shareholders voted on August 22nd to approve a dual primary listing in Hong Kong that enables it to join the southbound connect on September 9th what does that mean it means for the first time ever mainland China investors and there are 220 million of them they anticipate about 180 million as a potential Market to buy Alibaba stock uh will be able to buy Alibaba stock for the first time ever starting September 9th what&#39;s more important than that is that alibaba&#39;s got about 80 billion dollars of cash on their balance sheet and rather than they couldn&#39;t get that cash out of China to do buyback so they would have to issue non-dilutive convertible uh stock uh in order to get US dollars to buy the stock back back even though they had $80 billion sitting at home they will now be able to buy back stock through the southbound connect and you see just in the last few days since that dual primary listing was approved uh that they&#39;re reporting how much stock that they&#39;re buying back and we&#39;re going to see that accelerate so I think look uh you know everyone feels that China&#39;s uninvestable but if you look at the Hang sang for the last 20 years you have these huge Corrections every two to four years and uh the bigger the correction the longer it takes usually takes about two years to build the base but when it turns and it starts to move up it tends to be parabolic and you know you got to keep in mind through all the noise the country is still growing at 5% GDP and and here we are American exceptionalism no question about it but we&#39;re growing at two and a half percent. so there&#39;s opportunity there they will recover and I think demographically speaking they&#39;ve got another huge parabolic run before maybe they do run out of time three to five years out like Japan did in the late 80s because they didn&#39;t make enough babies for for so long but for now they&#39;ve got a huge portion of their population age 34 and their spending should should increase and uh Peak out at around age 40 got it Tom uh you&#39;re gonna be joining us for the 24 money Show Master Symposium in Sarasota this December um you know we talked about this sort of turnaround approach I just want to know when it comes to methodology why do you find that style of investing so attractive and what do you think people were looking look to be value investors or turnaround investors need to know when it comes to pointers or advice well number one uh a stock that falls 90% can fall another 50% before you get a five bagger so so it&#39;s uh uh there&#39;s something to be said there but what we like is we&#39;re we&#39;re not predict the next great thing people we are buying durable business that have been down around through many cycles and have have had multiple turnaround situations and have proven they have a durable Mo so even when the stock&#39;s down 60 or 80% or whatever it happens to be when we&#39;re getting involved we we&#39;re looking and we&#39;re seeing okay well the free cash flow and the revenues are kind of holding in there or in some cases they might might be down modestly they&#39;re not down 80% that I can assure you uh revenues are usually flat are growing and uh and free cash flow is usually positive and then you get some Catalyst with a new CEO that has talent to take this beautiful Legacy franchise that has been through multiple cycle Cycles over decades and turn it turn it back into something great and we like it because uh the margin of safety is much greater once we have comfort with the balance sheet Etc that we can make a double or triple in a handful of years versus uh business that&#39;s already up quite a bit you know we we had talked about uh you may have caught our note in uh June of this year when we said envidia was the new pain trade you can look it up on the website it was like June 22nd that day uh it opened at 136 it went up to 140 against us and has since Fallen about 30 40% uh because you know it&#39;s a great business but at $3.2 trillion valuation when you have a a total GDP of 28 trillion and an expected growth rate from the sell side of 40% a year what they&#39;re basically trying to convince you is that it&#39;s going to be half of GDP in four years which is absolutely makes no sense if you&#39;re interested and believe in something called math so um you know so those are the type of things that we avoid and uh and and other things that we can have a sense of certainty two three years out we can make a double or triple if it&#39;s a smaller business sometimes we can make a multibagger got it got it well just one last question I guess um you know beyond what we&#39;ve talked about here any other sneak peek or uh you know tidbits about what you think you might be talking about in Sarasota I know December&#39;s still a few months off so it&#39;s a little bit tough who knows what the market will do between now and then all I can tell you is in the unmagnify there are tremendous opportunities still that have been created by once in a 100y year event called covid and these are durable multi-decade franchises so we&#39;re going to talk about a few of our ideas for 2025 we&#39;re very excited about that we&#39;re going to talk about our General Market Outlook and we&#39;re gonna have a lot of fun well Tom listen thank you so much for your advice and your insights here viewers if you&#39;re watching and you want to learn more from Tom he is going to be joining us at that money Show Master and osum in Sarasota it runs December 5th to 7th at the Hiatt regeny Sarasota here in sunny Southwest Florida if you&#39;ve been to this part of the country uh in December you know how great the weather is going to be it&#39;s going to be a wonderful time uh enjoy the outside enjoy the knowledge you&#39;re going to get inside and learn from experts like Tom so uh click the link below look at the description if you need some more details and Tom I look forward to seeing you there in a couple of months thanks Mike and one finals Tom caveat opinion not advice thanks so much for having me got it sounds good take care Tom [Music] bye-bye [Music] and I want to go through couple of things now that we&#39;ve uh as many of you have been following us uh we bought a lot of uh Amazon in October of uh 2022 and then again in March of uh 2023 that has more than double we took off a uh the majority of the position in uh July as we talked about on the podcast and we&#39;ve taken off the rest of the position uh in um in the last week so you know Blended out of the thing somewhere around 190 and we got in down here so that&#39;s more than a double in a year and a half and some of these things uh you know they like like this one only took you know B basically a year and a half some of these work really really fast and others work more slowly and that&#39;s the name of the game well let&#39;s to look at anothers that we harvested we talked that we had sold out of uh um uh Bank of America I mean this was nearly a double off the lows uh and we took off the final 25% around 40 so Blended you know 401 two three range uh and that&#39;s not quite a double from the lows but that was a good trade and then city were fully out of uh this was a monster lows were 36 in change um uh we had some in the 30s some in the low 40s and um took off most of that and took off the rest this week at you know in the around 60 so that was close to a double and again these are this one was less than a year or or just a little bit over a year rather and you know whether it&#39;s so you just see over and over the framework works sometimes it takes longer sometimes okay now Google is one that we took off the majority of the position again in July perfectly timed right after we put that article out on Nvidia where we said uh the next pain trade and we had the picture of Jensen Wong signing some fans uh breast with his signature and and the stock that day opened at 136 went to 139 it since collapsed close to 100 it&#39;s bouncing around the bottom um so we got R out of most of Google at that we we still have that 25 30% tiny small stub in Google we&#39;re not going to sell Down in the Hole here but on the next strength up to 170 180 maybe it makes new highs if we get a rally into the the uh first cut but I doubt it uh will&#39;ll probably extinguish the rest of that position so again you see here late October 2022 and then again in March of 2023 when it was down at 90 you know got up to 190 when we were talking about it in July uh 180 and now it&#39;s at 160 again no matter where you slice it more than a double year and a half the framework continues to work uh smtc entered below 20 we took off the full position uh with a for handle some in July some in the last week uh same with uh C limited the reason we took this one off that one has gone from 32 uh lows to 83 and change uh we don&#39;t like the business enough and we have enough exposure to Asia e-commerce through Alibaba so we just booked that and then uh 3M we already told you uh this has been a monster we took we got out of this at 125 it went up to 135 now it&#39;s back to 130 uh would we consider reing this below 100 yes may we get that opportunity we don&#39;t know but again this is a huge move in a relatively short period of time and you book The win so the framework works over and over and over and sometimes it goes against you before it goes for you as a matter of fact every time it goes against you before it goes for you if you&#39;re doing a good job and um so so just some updates there now we&#39;ve got a tremendous amount of data and now we&#39;ve got our new batch that are bouncing around the lows and they&#39;re going to be our next batch of harvesting in the next year year and a half we&#39;re going to be doing this type of stuff for those of you who&#39;ve been following along and it&#39;s just going to work I mean 3M looked like it would never work in a million years by the way we still own all the svent that we got for free uh so that&#39;s exciting for for that and um all right so uh sentiment survey D data this came in at 45% bullish 24% bearish so look there&#39;s some bullishness it&#39;s being taken out of the market I think the look it all comes down to the jobs report I think the jobs report is going to come in uh week enough for to to to give people no doubt in their mind that the fed&#39;s going at least 25 possibly 50 I don&#39;t think they go 50 as I talked about with Mike because um he doesn&#39;t want to shock the market but I mean if it was unbelievably weak they might do 50 that would probably not be good for the market I think it&#39;s going to be um Goldilocks not too hot not too cold enough to guarantee the 25 and if that&#39;s turns out to be correct tomorrow and maybe the unemployment rate goes from 43 to 42 as as expected um we get the 25 it looks like the world&#39;s not falling apart and I think we probably see Equity strength into the first cut uh which would be a week and a half two weeks of super strength to suck every last person back in until we fall into some serious seasonal weakness both from an election year standpoint and a sell sell the news so uh we will use any of that strength to raise some more cash from some of our winners uh and be ready to either tactically hedge or have that catch ready to deploy in late October early November right before we get the election uh uh clearing up and end of year monster rally is our expectation uh auto sales volume thanks to Allen over there you know \n\n\nChina valued at just 40% of us markets this is like this is the kind of stuff where dreams are made of ladies and gentlemen when you can buy the mean two standard deviations out and even if it doesn't even get back to the mean you double and triple your money and that's where we are with China right now. \n### FEATURED_COMPANY_DEEP_DIVES\nCostco

here is\n\n### FEATURED_COMPANY_DEEP_DIVES\ncan&#39;t make this stuff up number three why would they start a new plane in fears of losing share when their competitor already has a backlog as large as theirs spanning a decade out for plane models they already produce it&#39;s like oh let&#39;s start a new plane that we can&#39;t afford to start even though we can&#39;t even deliver 10 years worth of orders worth $500 billion do of backlog let&#39;s start a new product you can&#39;t make this stuff up and furthermore let&#39;s raise $30 billion of equity and dude our shareholders for a product that we don&#39;t even need for a decade okay common sense is the most uncommon thing so number four even the analyst seeds quote their free cash flow could Spike to 20 billion dollars a year if they delay their next airplane development cycle duh I wonder what they&#39;re going to do number five I will be sending this analyst a Christmas card for allowing us to expand our position in the high 150s we are grateful for your service please write several more notes so we can add more size at lower prices and number six total company backlog is $516 billion including over 5,400 commercial airplanes for those worried about the quote health of Boeing may I offer you the world&#39;s smallest violin they&#39;ll be just fine only a matter of when not if and we scroll up so you can see the world&#39;s smallest violin moving on key catalyst is the new CEO Kelly ortberg who started on August 8th as CEO of Rockwell Collins he doubled sales in six years and quadrupled 4x the value of the company for shareholders before selling it at a price premium to United Technologies in 2019 um and so on so then we go into a nice report from Morning Star I like morning star&#39;s framework because they&#39;re all Buffet ties if you go out to the annual meetings they&#39;re always there they have a good investment framework and I you know we&#39;re running 112 all right we could go through some of these points but you can read it on your own the key here is  that there are only two players in town they have 99% of the market there&#39;s a Chinese player that&#39;s uh their their planes go Boeing&#39;s planes go 75% further they don&#39;t compete on any metric so they&#39;ll sell a bunch of crappy planes to their own Chinese Airlines no one outside of China is going to buy a Chinese airplane that I can guarantee you and even the ones inside if they want to be competitive they got to have Boeing and Airbus so uh um the Chinese company will maybe take if they&#39;re lucky uh let&#39;s see arj21 that&#39;s a company called comac they&#39;ve been trying to do this for 10 15 years Chinese carrier uh carriers took delivery of 30 almost 30 aircraft per month on average we have no reason to believe that ramping up the larger and more complex c919 will be an easier process than ramping up arj which has taken them you know 15 plus years and um the 737 Max 7 for instance can travel roughly 75% more nautical miles than than comx similar size c919 and the economics Drive Airline purchase decisions in some the technical complexity of aircraft manufacturing is a material barrier to entry which we believe constitutes intangible Boeing and Airbus are the only two capable suppliers of globally competitive aircraft larger than 130 seats and we don&#39;t see any Global competitive new entrance entering the market anytime soon therefore we believe it&#39;s reasonable to assume that almost all Global demand for new air CL will flow through the income statement of a comment incumbents that we conc that some Chinese demand will likely move toward com back um Market is large enough and unders supplied enough to support two wide modes we built a 20-year aviation forecast for deliveries Etc Market will return to undersupplied state that both manufacturers will continue to benefit from barriers to entry and switching costs from lack of alternative suppliers I mean this is this is a business made in heaven\n### MACRO_DATA_SLIDES\nearnings Russell small cap earnings estimates last 60 days up 2.19% for next year this year Le becomes less we only got three more months left uh and for next year on S&P up 76% which is also Al positive so estimates keep going up not down everyone&#39;s been waiting for them to go down they&#39;re going up up up tomorrow what are we looking for estimates are 164,000 non-farm payroll so I think below 100 people would get nervous and start to price in a 50 basis point cut I think at uh above 200 maybe people would get a little nervous about no cut but I they already told you they&#39;re going to do a cut so I think you want to see a number above 164 like I think 140 to 180 is good and that probably gets the market back uh getting bid again for the next week and a half uh below 100 I don&#39;t know above 250 I don&#39;t know but you know anywhere in the middle Market&#39;s going to like it\n\n###

    "### MISCELLANEOUS": "\n\nhere is that in all years including election year September is uh 1% on average in election years it's better than um uh uh it's a positive month barely a positive month but a positive month uh so so that's that okay what 2024 looks like a lot like 2023 that's from Dietrich over at Carson I don't think that's really relevant but it it does look similar in which case it would be weakness into the end of October which is our base case followed by super uh strong year end rally I just think we're going to see a little bit of strength before that first cut and the Catalyst will probably be my guess is tomorrow's jobs report so here is more seasonality from 1976 through 2023 this is a presidential year and you do see a big popup here into uh mid to late September before the rollover into late October prior to the election and that is more in line with how we're thinking about it let's see what happens August does well in election years yeah we know that but uh so what they're saying\n\nhere is like trillions and trillions of Rel leverage availability coming to a theater near you and Americans will figure out a way to tap that as long as rates go down 100 150 basis points which uh which will be plenty to get them back out there revering um mag 7 still owned by 70% or more of funds that bank of America tracks They are feeling some serious pain in the last two months like meaningful pain uh mag 7 earnings decelerating other 493 accelerating by the way you may want to go back to that article that I wrote in on June 20th you can just go to commentary and uh pull up the one that has Jensen Wong signing there you go the next pain trade and we talked about Nvidia and we talked about the mag 7 we're going to roll over when they're trading at all-time highs and that's what's taking taking place um and uh and I think more of that to come because if you look again here to remind you mag 7 earnings decelerating other 493 accelerating\n\nAsos is up 15% today um we still haven&#39;t leaned into the position but we were really happy to see that with our existing position this thing starting to move we&#39;ve been talking about the turn around in UK we&#39;ve played it through a real siiz position in gxo logistics which gets 50% of their revenues over there uh and Asos in a smaller position we are going to spend some more time and determine whether or not this becomes a serious position or just a small position but it&#39;s nice to see some life that they got from finally selling the top stock sh stop Top Shop stake that we&#39;ve been talking about and they were supposed to do nine months ago they",
    "QUOTES_OF_THE_WEEK": "\n\nagain I keep emphasizing because this theme will make you the most money in the next couple of years mag 7 growth went from 50% to 35% to 18% next quarter to 19% what happened with UNM magificent 493 -2 to 6 next quarter will be+ 1 then plus 15% in the fourth quarter and uh and more next year PE ratio of the top 10 and remaining stocks in the S&amp;P 500 so if you back out the mag 7 which are going to come down or underperform the rest of the market is relatively cheap 18.4 times with 15% earnings growth is bar you know 1 two times Peg price price to earnings growth is pretty good pickings weight of the top 10 stocks in the S&amp;P 500 36% again mean reversion earnings contribution of the top 10 in the S&amp;P 500 is only 28% so they&#39;ve got 36% call it of the waiting at the peak with only 28% of the earnings growth and his historically what you see is that mean reverts very very quickly value versus growth in different interest rate environments what does value outperform best in it outperforms growth in environments between 4 to 5% and greater than 5% so that&#39;s why we could see a situation where we only go 125 to 150 for the whole cycle and that&#39;s an environment for like 2021 to 2027 value out performed dramatically for five six seven years along with Emerging Markets which in my book is value on any metric and um dividend payers and small caps median path of the S&amp;P around an uninversity % GDP growth uh this is the path which is upward why everyone worries is because often that happens and causes a recession uh I think this time has proven well one we already had the recession that everyone&#39;s waiting for in 20122 they just didn&#39;t declare it despite two quarters of negative GDP growth which we&#39;ve covered at infinitum on this podcast uh technology jobs are where all the cuts are happening you&#39;re seeing it already 40,000 some OD Cuts since July uh that&#39;s going to continue us equities versus Commodities at 2 and 1/2 year High We Believe Commodities are just reaccelerating there&#39;s going to be huge opportunities right now we&#39;re expressed through um comto which we love we have albamar which is a smaller newer position uh we haven&#39;t leaned into yet but we&#39;re actively looking for more opportunity to get exposure uh seasonality of since 1976 Presidential year we covered this again rally into midt rollover after secular bull market in Commodities just beginning we&#39;re covered that GDP growth boost due to AI will boost oil Demand by 200,000 barrels per day in 5 years 700,000 barrels per day in 10 years we are in the middle of a rough patch this is from Dietrich over at Carson but the rough patch doesn&#39;t begin until the 17th it shows the average return per day from 1950 to 2023 as you can see all the red comes from the 18th to the 30th of September all the green is beforehand with a little bit of spottiness early in the month which we saw this week so that&#39;s data like there&#39;s nobody&#39;s business \n### QUOTES_OF_THE_WEEK\nmoving on to the quote of the weeks you from Buffett you can&#39;t reach success in investment if you do not think independently uh you know people could fault me for a lot of things but no one will ever accuse me of not thinking independently that I can damn assure you uh there&#39;s no uh her following uh here that&#39;s for sure Charlie Munger a lot of people with high IQs are terrible investors because they&#39;ve got terrible temp forments and by the way not just highq but super successful entrepreneurs who get paid for Massive Action yielding massive results and in our business we have to have the discipline to take inaction massive inaction gets the best results when you&#39;ve done your work you just sit on your butt and wait and don&#39;t get faked out like everyone trading the short-term noise\n### HEADLINES_AND_NEWS\nChina&#39;s internet users near 1.1 billion that is still a growing Market driven by short videos mobile payments alibaba&#39;s participating on both fronts Alibaba wins beijing&#39;s approval ending years long scrutiny so what began with this antitrust Watchdog in 2021 which caused the stock to collapse from 320 down to 56 uh is now officially over this was announced on Friday uh uh August 30th and Baba secured the Endor M of China&#39;s Anti-Trust Watchdog more than 3 years after a landmark probe into its online Behavior suggesting Beijing is Keen to Signal its support for the country&#39;s giant internet sector amen hallelujah Alibaba shares rise after it completes threeyear regulatory overhaul uh Alibaba is completely stopped the quote choose one of two Monopoly Behavior the SM samr said uh completed the rectification process that started in 2021 China&#39;s Market regulator said on Friday it&#39;s an interesting timing considering they&#39;re in the market buying bonds I and they&#39;re in the market buying equities it wouldn&#39;t surprise me if I&#39;m the government I want to use the southbound connect opportunity When Baba starts to move to juice that stock if they juice the the alab Baba stock the entire world will start to flow back into China uh and all they have to do is move one stock and it&#39;s not even moving it it&#39;s you know it&#39;s funny someone said to me like oh um see people think that alibaba&#39;s business has to double from here for the stock to double from here and that couldn&#39;t be further from the truth the business is actually grown since the stock has been $300 what you had was multiple like unprecedented multiple contraction because of government interference once in a 100y Year events you name it all the that we know about is now over so what&#39;s going to happen as earnings go up is all of these higher quality Chinese companies are going to start to get multiple doesn&#39;t we don&#39;t even have to say multiple expansion multiple normalization would be a double alone with no improvement in business performance and then uh markets uh overshoot on both sides despondency on the downside Euphoria so you&#39;re not going to get a reversion to the mean you&#39;re going to get a reversion well above the mean and at the same time the business is going to continue to improve they stop they stop P pinu Duo dead in their tracks we saw in the last two quarters if you read both transcripts you&#39;re going to realize uh they&#39;re competition picked up from Alibaba Alibaba fell asleep at the wheel and they walk up right before they drove the car over the bridge and they said no MOS and they went brutal guns blazing at pindu Duo and pushed them back and now they&#39;re back on a run and the game is back on so uh then you get the Tailwind of the economy then you get the government you know uh starting to move on policy because protests are happening etc etc and we&#39;re We&#39;re Off to the Races but this is a huge message at an interesting time with the southbound connect expected to go live as soon as next week which means both the company will be able to buy back shares without issuing convert because they can buy it uh with their local currency uh the Chinese government would have an easier time buying it and uh and 180 to 220 million new retail investors who have not been able to buy the Amazon of their own country for 10 years will now be able to Own It For the First Time their National Champion Ali Baba only one National Champion ladies and gentlemen Chinese e-commerce giant pindu Duo updates rules to kick out sellers of shotty products this is hysterical which basically means they will have no more sellers I mean you can&#39;t make this stuff off uh China is trading its own bonds to stifle a runaway Bond rally yields are going to start going up that we talked about that Yuan goes up yields go up stocks go up uh Yen goes up China stocks listed in Us near cheapest levels ever versus NASDAQ peers uh Golden Dragon index valued at record discount to NASDAQ 100 this always mean reverts the last time it got this low was 2014 and not only did it mean revert it overshot then the same thing in 2008 2009 not only did it mean revert it overshoots this is the PE spread last time it was this close was again 2014 2015 and then back in 2006 uh Etc so pretty exciting stuff there Biden uh okay so Intel when&#39;s the next Catalyst number one I think we&#39;re going to wake up one morning and someone like Elliott or some other major activist is going to be in the stock why because if they liquidate the whole company they get their money back if they follow through on the plan and create value they get double or triple their money back so all they have to do is shake a few trees and the stock will go up so this is a no-brainer for an activist but the board is having a meeting midt according to people familiar with the matter this is in Bloomberg um and um so we&#39;ll get stuff like maybe not doing the German Factory um selling off some of these non-core uh assets like Mobil ey and uh there was a a couple other non-core that they talked about uh and really the plan forward and then whether G singer&#39;s head goes on the chopping block or not I don&#39;t know that that&#39;s the right move I I um I mean unless they announce like just an unbelievable name but um we&#39;ll see but change is coming and that&#39;s a good thing especially when you have a stock trading a tangible book China weighs cutting mortgage rates in two steps to Shield Banks officials proposed rate cuts of about 80 basis points move to boost household consumption ease pressure on banks who is the toll taker for household consumption in China the answer is tabba t-all Alibaba China hundred billion doll short against dollar enriches hedge fund state owned banks are helping support the Yuan and the tra and they are doing so with a hundred billion doll short on the US dollar Chip War Taiwan accuses eight Mainland Chinese firms of poaching talent and stealing Secrets what did you expect them to do with the sanctions again just to reiterate all we did was take them off our tit they were they were dependent on us to buy all their chips and we said we are not selling you chips anymore in the name of National Security and the result is now they&#39;re going to poach all the talent around the world pay these guys four times not only are they going to poach Taiwanese they&#39;re going to poach Americans and they&#39;re going to get all the intellectual property and instead of being dependent and giving us all the money uh sooner or later we&#39;re going to be giving them all the money and that was just bad policy uh shortsightedness and um you know so for everyone worried about them not having the chips for AI they already got them Microsoft rolled out AI PCS that can&#39;t play Top Games and there&#39;s no quick fix it&#39;s the Qualcomm arm processor chips what&#39;s their Quick Fix notice the the one company that is not in this article is Intel who shipped 40 million AIP PCS this year the leader in aip&#39;s no problemos with intellos chios so the moral of the story is they do have value and Moes Etc uh here&#39;s whether they&#39;re going to get rid of gelsinger or not we&#39;ll see uh Intel is trading at tangible books says Thomas Hayes on Fox Business Intel uh more on Intel oh working a variety of options uh anyways and activist defense Yuan hits strongest in over a year as flows offset fundamentals that will be more the case after the first cut this is what we need to see Northface parent VF Corp sees big Insider stock by so one of the board member you know Bracken made a million of purchases we know that and former Chief Financial of Yum brands who sits on the board bought 350,000 I mean this guy it&#39;s not a huge amount of money but he&#39;s a CFO of young Brands probably worth five or 10 million bucks um so it&#39;s not nothing he raised Disney park prices and fans still love him now he&#39;s on the CE show short list this is the next Catalyst for Disney his name is Josh dearo diaro he is an experiences master and uh one of the two key candidates for Disney Boeing investors weigh cost of strike as clock ticks on contract this is part of the reason for some of the weight on the stock they do this over and over they&#39;ll get it resolved if the UAW can resolve with GM and Ford then uh Boeing can resolve with their workers as well and they will with the new CEO biotech stocks are showing signs of Life why the rally could continue we covered that earlier with the chart great to have you back uh Jim Grant The Perennial pessimist is now saying 50 basis Cuts is more likely now uh if they&#39;re going to do 50 my guess it was is it will be on the second cut in November versus the first cut but we&#39;ll see no one has a perfect crystal ball us SA regulator calls for probe of teu and shine over deadly baby and toddler products I mean this thing is a complete disaster and uh remember we&#39;ve been saying since day one unsustainable numbers or unreliable numbers it doesn&#39;t matter the key is they&#39;re slowing and declining boj board member Tata sees need to shift gears which is code for uh raise rate so as soon as the FED starts cutting boj is going to start re unwinding the carry trade uh I.E hiking rates I.E unwinding the mag s trade where you borrowed for nothing and you shorted Yen and you bought mag 7 Boeing says China commercial air fleet predicted to double in the next two decades demand for 8830 new planes Google is losing market share to chat GPT what it means for alphabet stock um you know better to be lucky than to be good uh we sold the majority of the position uh after that pain trade article in early July uh and uh we&#39;ll look to get out of the rest it&#39;s not so much I think when all is said and done they&#39;re going to do great in AI uh I think that some point sometimes you got to ring the register and we&#39;d like to do it and we&#39;d like to reinitiate maybe at much lower levels and maybe it&#39;ll just keep running away from against us and that&#39;s fine too but we got plenty of plenty of new ideas so uh Boeing speeds 737 deliveries to China in respit for new CEO Intel is we covered that this is tonight they&#39;re selling part of Mobile ey and also um their Network and Edge business uh which is uh w",
    "### FEATURED_COMPANY_DEEP_DIVES": "\n\nmoving on to Boeing so these two charts are critical and if you&#39;re listening go to hedge fun tips.com when while you&#39;re there click on terms this is all opinion not advice my friend in Dallas got me this beautiful cup opinions not advice booya hedge fun tips what a thoughtful amazing gift and then they also got me this when I did episode 200 um all right world smallest violin so when you look and you find this article click on commentary or click on most popular post it&#39;s the number one most popular post today and probably will be tomorrow as well so this shows the chart since 1974 and you&#39;re looking at uh 50 years five decades and what you see is it keeps having these Corrections and it keeps recovering to new highs and it keeps having these Corrections and it keeps recovering to new highs it keeps having these Corrections keeps recovering to new highs keeps having these Corrections keeps recovering to new highs and this time will be no different why because it&#39;s a duopoly and people like to fly and they can only get their planes from two companies which have 99% of the market Bombardier tried to do it they got smoked okay the US government said you can do it but we&#39;re going to charge you 300% tariffs so tells you everything you need to know um you also see the table and the chart above are all you need to know about duopolistic Boeing for decades it has had periods of negative free cash flow followed by free cash flow recoveries negative free cash flow free cash flow recovery negative free cash flow free cash flow recovery negative free cash flow free cash flow recovery it has had periods of dips in revenues followed by recoveries to new highs in revenues that&#39;s called a cyclical business not a secular grower a cyclical grower here you saw in the mid90s a dip in recovery followed by a Rec recovery in revenues dip in revenues followed by a recovery in 2000 dip in revenues 2004 followed by a recovery dip in revenues 2008 followed by recovery dip in revenues 2011 followed by recovery dip in revenues in a one in 100 Year event in 2021 starting to recover and it goes on and on it has had periods of dips in stock price followed by recoveries to new highs in stock price this time will be no different okay so you got a160 stock that over time will be a $436 stock at least and probably higher than that we don&#39;t know if that&#39;s in 3 years we don&#39;t know if that&#39;s in 5 years so if it goes to 100 before it goes to 400 and you own it at $160 is that a life-threatening thing no unless you own it on margin and leverage or you&#39;re impatient or don&#39;t understand what you own uh more likely than not maybe it goes to 150 we add a few more shares and then it starts to work its way towards 300 over the next three plus years and we make it double over three years which is in line with our uh acceptable irr over time and uh and we can sleep at well at night putting siiz on in a pos position like this because now we actually have an engineer running the company who created a four bagger while he did in six years in Rockwell Collins which which is in a similar business or an ancillary business uh so that&#39;s that Tuesday&#39;s downgrade by a short-termist cide analyst was comical quote Boeing delays its1 billion a year free cash flow Target by one year from 2026 to 2027 for those slow with math the market cap is just a hundred billion dollar right now or 10 times two years out free cash flow a 10% free cash flow yield here was the Reuters article citing one of the most ridiculous analyst reports I&#39;ve seen in my years in the business annual cash flow may be delayed to 2027 2028 and it would have to raise $30 billion before developing a new aircraft Wells Fargo said in the downgraded stock shares in the Dell component fell 7% Boeing carries about 45 billion in net debt it must address this before it kicks off the next aircraft development cycle cutting the debt would consume its cash flow through 2030 here&#39;s he goes on to say given a likely new aircraft launch Boeing will need to shore up the balance sheet sooner uh said XYZ analyst who is rated three out of five stars for estimate accuracy on lseg workspace I wouldn&#39;t even go to a taco place rated three out of five never mind invest based on their opinion all right we estimate roughly 30 billion Equity raise to get back to zero net debt by 2027 number one is Dave Ramsey Boeing&#39;s new financial advisor like who the hell said anything about net debt getting to zero why would you ever do that I mean it you can&#39;t even make this stuff up like this guy just got out of a Tony Robins seminar is walking on coals talking about being debt free it doesn&#39;t work that way in the real world my man so let&#39;s talk about the Five Points number one this is the silliest statement I&#39;ve ever seen an analyst put in writing quote we estimate a roughly 30 billion Equity raised to get back to zero net debt why would they ever go into zero net debt when did Dave Ramsey become Boeing&#39;s new financial adviser number two why is RO Reuters quoting an analyst who is ranked quote three out of five stars for accuracy you can&#39;t make this stuff up number three why would they start a new plane in fears of losing share when their competitor already has a backlog as large as theirs spanning a decade out for plane models they already produce it&#39;s like oh let&#39;s start a new plane that we can&#39;t afford to start even though we can&#39;t even deliver 10 years worth of orders worth $500 billion do of backlog let&#39;s start a new product you can&#39;t make this stuff up and furthermore let&#39;s raise $30 billion of equity and dude our shareholders for a product that we don&#39;t even need for a decade okay common sense is the most uncommon thing so number four even the analyst seeds quote their free cash flow could Spike to 20 billion dollars a year if they delay their next airplane development cycle duh I wonder what they&#39;re going to do number five I will be sending this analyst a Christmas card for allowing us to expand our position in the high 150s we are grateful for your service please write several more notes so we can add more size at lower prices and number six total company backlog is $516 billion including over 5,400 commercial airplanes for those worried about the quote health of Boeing may I offer you the world&#39;s smallest violin they&#39;ll be just fine only a matter of when not if and we scroll up so you can see the world&#39;s smallest violin moving on key catalyst is the new CEO Kelly ortberg who started on August 8th as CEO of Rockwell Collins he doubled sales in six years and quadrupled 4x the value of the company for shareholders before selling it at a price premium to United Technologies in 2019 um and so on so then we go into a nice report from Morning Star I

      "the existing business the market didn&#39;t like the soft guidance for the next two quarters same as Disney they didn&#39;t like the soft guidance for the next two quarters same as Dollar General same as Dollar Tree but it&#39;s temporary not permanent and don&#39;t count out this consumer as long as the fed&#39;s not too late and we believe so long as they go the 25 uh my our base case is 25 25 25 I would not be surprised if we do 75 to 100 and even though inflation is only you know is is much lower I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if they don&#39;t have to do more than 75 or 100 because I think inflation is going to oscillate between two and four and four and a half% for the next three to five years and they could probably hold the FED funds at 350 to four and get away with it um and that&#39;s the environment actually that value does well as well so um consumer spending contribution to GDP growth Services good look oh this is really interesting ladies and gentlemen this is what I was talking about dstock restock Goods demand is coming back and normalizing uh after it went negative in the first quarter it&#39;s back so that was our trough base case which was in fourth quarter of last year initial jobl claims climbing up that&#39;s why the FED is taking action uh let&#39;s see here yeah consumer spending still a big part of it S&P monthly returns going back to 1928 again this really pre-World War II data is not terribly helped full uh with September being the worst month that&#39;s from the mly flu full down 1.17% on average US pending home sales at historic lows what&#39;s going to change very quickly to change that is you know here&#39;s the thing a lot of people have an enormous amount of equity Boomers trapped in their houses and they can&#39;t get out because they don&#39;t want to trade a 3% mortgage for a 7% mortgage well what&#39;s going to happen is mortgage rates are going to go in drop into a five handle pretty damn quickly maybe it&#39;s 5&#39;9 it doesn&#39;t matter it&#39;s it&#39;s uh psychological with the 5% and while they weren&#39;t willing to do 7% they&#39;re going to be willing to trade 3 to five particularly if they book a seven fig profit on a house that they bought for you know an apple pie and two slices of ice cream 40 years ago is now worth a couple mil and maybe they&#39;ve taken a million of equity out at 3% and they can book a Mill and then buy a townhouse for a mill cash or or or or Finance one at five and change and uh and uh invest the the mill of profits uh and live happily ever after so the thing where I think they&#39;re going to get hurt that most of them don&#39;t realize is that as rates go down I think there&#39;s going to be a mad rush of supply pushed on the market massive amount of supply and for those who think well my my price is going to go even higher as rates go down because it trades like a bond I think they&#39;re going to be uh surprised that um uh they&#39;re going to have an enormous amount of competition with so many houses coming on all at once us pending home sales tumbled a record low in July that&#39;s going to change very quickly Japanese CPI going back up which means boj going to be hiking which means Yen going higher Juan going higher dollar going lower Japanese equities probably going lower Chinese Yuan strongest against the dollar since the beginning of the year moving in the right direction this is what we see when Chinese equities start going going up Chinese exports up 2.6% since October 2023 where it&#39;s going to the rest of the world they are much lower to the us but they are holding steady to the rest of the world so the rest of the world benefits from their sweat shops while we are not benefiting as much um that&#39;s a little bit of an exaggeration but I also think that&#39;s probably related to believe it or not automobiles we&#39;re not allowing Chinese cars in the US anytime soon uh so um and you know Germany&#39;s shutting down factories because they&#39;re letting the Chinese cars in so we&#39;ll see what happens there I think they&#39;re going to be a lot more tariffs coming to a theater nearu against the Chinese cars uh economic grievances fuel protests in China this is what we need to see to cause a bazooka type stimulus and we&#39;re going to talk we&#39;re going to show you some of the things they&#39;ve been doing in the last week top 10 cities for economic Pro protest shenzen leading the way uh and uh you can go down the list here protest linked to China&#39;s former real estate Giants Country Garden everr Etc the natives are getting restless uh moving on private clients bought Reit financials MLPs so opinion follows Trend they&#39;re dumping out of CH uh Japan rather not China there&#39;s no one left to sell China they&#39;re getting out of Japan buying financials what were we doing selling financials to you and uh fed easing history and SNP price return so everyone says that the um when the fed eases you get a recession that is not the case you did not get one the three times in 1980s 80 looks like 83 85 887 Market went up uh same thing with the midcycle cuts in 9598 same thing and I think we&#39;re going to be mid cycle here the probably the closest thing to this would be 80 to 83 we got the recession like in 2020 and 2022 and then the second one 83 easing Cy uh paves away for bull market and good things to come fed easing history and 10-year note yield well while equities go up and midcycle cuts bond yields go down every single time so we like that that&#39;s part of our core thesis treasury yields stay down dollar goes down Emerging Markets go up dividend pairs go up small caps go up value goes up mag 7 moderates we&#39;ve already started seeing that us real consumer

know we&#39;re kind of levered to that with j and Stanley Black and&amp; Decker anyway uh fed favored inflation gauges mild gain set stage for rate cut and okay consumer inflation expectations are at

Dallas got me this beautiful cup opinions not advice booya hedge fun tips what a thoughtful amazing gift and then they also got me this when I did episode 200 um all right world smallest violin so when you look and you find this article click on commentary or click on most popular post it&#39;s the number one most popular post today and probably will be tomorrow as well so this shows the chart since 1974 and you&#39;re looking at uh 50 years five decades and what you see is it keeps having these Corrections and it keeps recovering to new highs and it keeps having these Corrections and it keeps recovering to new highs it keeps having these Corrections keeps recovering to new highs keeps having these Corrections keeps recovering to new highs and this time will be no different why because it&#39;s a duopoly and people like to fly and they can only get their planes from two companies which have 99% of the market Bombardier tried to do it they got smoked okay the US government said you can do it but we&#39;re going to charge you 300% tariffs so tells you everything you need to know um you also see the table and the chart above are all you need to know about duopolistic Boeing for decades it has had periods of negative free cash flow followed by free cash flow recoveries negative free cash flow free cash flow recovery negative free cash flow free cash flow recovery negative free cash flow free cash flow recovery it has had periods of dips in revenues followed by recoveries to new highs in revenues that&#39;s called a cyclical business not a secular grower a cyclical grower here you saw in the mid90s a dip in recovery followed by a Rec recovery in revenues dip in revenues followed by a recovery in 2000 dip in revenues 2004 followed by a recovery dip in revenues 2008 followed by recovery dip in revenues 2011 followed by recovery dip in revenues in a one in 100 Year event in 2021 starting to recover and it goes on and on it has had periods of dips in stock price followed by recoveries to new highs in stock price this time will be no different okay so you got a160 stock that over time will be a $436 stock at least and probably higher than that we don&#39;t know if that&#39;s in 3 years we don&#39;t know if that&#39;s in 5 years so if it goes to 100 before it goes to 400 and you own it at $160 is that a life-threatening thing no unless you own it on margin and leverage or you&#39;re impatient or don&#39;t understand what you own uh more likely than not maybe it goes to 150 we add a few more shares and then it starts to work its way towards 300 over the next three plus years and we make it double over three years which is in line with our uh acceptable irr over time and uh and we can sleep at well at night putting siiz on in a pos position like this because now we actually have an engineer running the company who created a four bagger while he did in six years in Rockwell Collins which which is in a similar business or an

for those slow with math the market cap is just a hundred billion dollar right now or 10 times two years out free cash flow a 10% free cash flow yield here was the Reuters article citing one of the most ridiculous analyst reports I&#39;ve seen in my years in the business annual cash flow may be delayed to 2027 2028 and it would have to raise $30 billion before developing a new aircraft Wells Fargo said in the downgraded stock shares in the Dell component fell 7% Boeing carries about 45 billion in net debt it must address this before it kicks off the next aircraft development cycle cutting the debt would consume its cash flow through 2030 here&#39;s he goes on to say given a likely new aircraft launch Boeing will need to shore up the balance sheet sooner uh said XYZ analyst who is rated three out of five stars for estimate accuracy on lseg workspace I wouldn&#39;t even go to a taco place rated three out of five never mind invest based on their opinion all right we estimate roughly 30 billion Equity raise to get back to zero net debt by 2027 number one is Dave Ramsey Boeing&#39;s new financial advisor like who the hell said anything about net debt getting to zero why would you ever do that I mean it you can&#39;t even make this stuff up like this guy just got out of a Tony Robins seminar is walking on coals talking about being debt free it doesn&#39;t work that way in the real world my man so let&#39;s talk about the Five Points number one this is the silliest statement I&#39;ve ever seen an analyst put in writing quote we estimate a roughly 30 billion Equity raised to get back to zero net debt why would they ever go into zero net debt when did Dave Ramsey become Boeing&#39;s new financial adviser number two why is RO Reuters quoting an analyst who is ranked quote three out of five stars for accuracy you can&#39;t make this stuff up number three why would they start a new plane in fears of losing share when their competitor already has a backlog as large as theirs spanning a decade out for plane models they already produce it&#39;s like oh let&#39;s start a new plane that we can&#39;t afford to start even though we can&#39;t even deliver 10 years worth of orders worth $500 billion do of backlog let&#39;s start a new product you can&#39;t make this stuff up and furthermore let&#39;s raise $30 billion of equity and dude our shareholders for a product that we don&#39;t even need for a decade okay common sense is the most uncommon thing so number four even the analyst seeds quote their free cash flow could Spike to 20 billion dollars a year if they delay their next airplane development cycle duh I wonder what they&#39;re going to do number five I will be sending this analyst a Christmas card for allowing us to expand our position in the high 150s we are grateful for your service please write several more notes so we can add more size at lower prices and number six total company backlog is $516 billion including over 5,400 commercial airplanes for those worried about the quote health of Boeing may I offer you the world&#39;s smallest violin they&#39;ll be just fine only a matter of when not if and we scroll up so you can see the world&#39;s smallest violin moving on key catalyst is the new CEO Kelly ortberg who started on August 8th as CEO of Rockwell Collins he doubled sales in six years and quadrupled 4x the value of the company for shareholders before selling it at a price premium to United Technologies in 2019 um and so on so then we go into a nice report from Morning Star I like morning star&#39;s framework because they&#39;re all Buffet ties if you go out to the annual meetings they&#39;re always there they have a good investment framework and I you know we&#39;re running 112 all right we could go through some of these points but you can read it on your own the key",
