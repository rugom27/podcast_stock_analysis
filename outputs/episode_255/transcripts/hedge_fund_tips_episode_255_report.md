# Hedge Fund Tips with Tom Hayes – Episode N/A
### September 5th 2024

**Executive Summary**
> Tom Hayes is extremely bullish on value stocks, small caps, and emerging markets, particularly China. He believes the Fed will cut rates, leading to a weaker dollar and a rotation out of the Magnificent 7 into undervalued sectors. He is pounding the table on Alibaba, seeing it as a generational opportunity due to its dual listing and the potential for mainland Chinese investors to buy the stock. He also likes Boeing, viewing it as a duopoly with a new CEO poised to turn the company around. He is selling Google and is cautious on Nvidia.

**Tom's Current Market Conviction: Bullish, expecting a rally into the first rate cut followed by seasonal weakness and then a year-end rally. → 8/10** 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥☆☆

- Fed is likely to cut rates, which is historically positive for markets.
- Earnings estimates are up 15% for next year.
- Market breadth is improving, with a rotation out of the Magnificent 7.
- Household balance sheets are deleveraged, with potential for releveraging.

## Macro Thesis & Key Data Points
The Fed will cut rates due to concerns about the labor market, leading to a weaker dollar, lower treasury yields, and a rotation into value stocks, small caps, and emerging markets. The consumer is generally healthy, but there is a tale of two cities, with lower-income consumers struggling. A restock cycle is beginning, and housing will recover as mortgage rates fall.

| Indicator | Value | Tom's Interpretation |
|-----------|-------|----------------------|
| Jobs Report | Expected to be weak enough to guarantee a 25 basis point cut, possibly 50. | A Goldilocks jobs report will lead to equity strength into the first cut. |
| Consumer Spending | Revised GDP up to 2.5% due to consumer spending. | The consumer is not dead, despite some weakness at the lower end. |
| Household Debt to Disposable Income | At historic lows. | Households are deleveraged and can releverage, boosting the economy. |
| China's Economic Protests | Increasing in top cities. | This will cause a bazooka-type stimulus from the Chinese government. |
| US Pending Home Sales | At historic lows. | This will change quickly as mortgage rates drop into a five handle. |
