[99.96s] of 41s and 43s but just not putting them
[103.36s] together yet for two times in a row but
[106.119s] uh back in the right gear and pretty
[109.68s] excited I think I&#39;m going to dial that
[111.24s] in and get it done before the end of the
[112.92s] year want to thank uh now on to the
[115.28s] media want to thank Preston Melle
[118.52s] Christian dagger and Stuart vanney for
[120.92s] having me on vanney and Company on
[122.92s] Friday we talked about Intel which is a
[125.24s] very controversial stock right now we&#39;re
[127.68s] not going to go into a lot of it because
[129.72s] there&#39;s going to be a board meeting
[132.12s] midt there are activists circling around
[135.56s] this stock and once we identify who they
[138.4s] are and their track recorded turnarounds
[140.8s] we&#39;re going to ride that train uh and
[143.519s] they&#39;re selling off mobile ey they they
[145.44s] just announced thank God what took you
[147.16s] know took them long enough uh they won&#39;t
[150.28s] do the Germany Factory which is
[152.319s] perfectly fine we care about the US
[154.44s] factories and um you know and they&#39;re
[157.0s] swirling about getting rid of
[159.04s] Ginger I I&#39;m kind of I&#39;m not really in
[164.0s] that camp yet I know everyone wants to
[165.68s] blame Ginger but uh let&#39;s see what
[168.84s] happens in the next few weeks it&#39;s
[170.56s] trading at tangible book what does that
[172.239s] mean in English if they were to
[173.879s] liquidate the company today in other
[176.44s] words they&#39;re attributing no value for
[179.28s] the organic growth of the business and
[180.8s] we spent 3 hours explaining why that was
[183.239s] a a false narrative uh but um that
[186.76s] creates the opportunity to buy down here
[188.64s] which we took advantage of uh so uh
[191.12s] let&#39;s tune into
[194.2s] Stu premarket action on a Friday morning
[196.76s] right before a long holiday weekend
[198.48s] solid gain for the NASDAQ look at that
[200.08s] up 166 points that is 86% Tom hay is
[204.159s] back with us to look at the markets this
[205.56s] morning all right margins uh profits and
[208.56s] profit margins have been good this
[210.159s] earning season does that mean the rally
[212.84s] continues I think the theme Here stew is
[215.2s] stay alive till 2025 what do I mean by
[217.56s] that the music&#39;s playing right now we&#39;re
[219.04s] going to dance until that first cut
[220.92s] which is usually historically a buy the
[222.879s] rumor sell the news so we might get a
[225.04s] little choppiness before the election
[226.84s] that&#39;s also in line with election year
[228.68s] seasonality since World War II so if
[231.4s] you&#39;re on margin if you&#39;re on Leverage
[232.959s] come off margin and leverage uh stay
[235.76s] invested enjoy the volatility in October
[239.159s] and will get a year-end rally once we
[241.159s] know that uh gridlock is in regardless
[243.519s] of which party wins the executive branch
[245.84s] we just want to see gridlock the less
[247.84s] politicians can do the better for the
[249.799s] stock market you love some gridlock when
[251.2s] you always does well for the market
[252.519s] that&#39;s true now you got two stocks that
[254.04s] you like I want to start with gener the
[255.959s] generate of people 70% of the market the
[258.72s] stock is down 70% from its covid highs
[261.759s] why they over inventoried because they
[263.759s] thought they couldn&#39;t get parts they
[265.08s] worked through that inventory it
[266.6s] troughed in the fourth quarter of last
[268.44s] year it&#39;s reacel ating it&#39;s up off off
[270.919s] the lows of $780 it&#39;s up to 155 we think
[274.0s] this can go much higher this was a $500
[276.08s] stock they&#39;ll be generating similar cash
[278.36s] flows within the next 12 to 24 months
[280.28s] that they were at their Peak interest
[281.96s] rates lowering is going to help this
[283.52s] because people Finance the per purchases
[285.8s] and we&#39;ve got hurricane season right
[287.24s] around the corner so that&#39;s good for Gen
[289.36s] 70% of the market yeah and the grid
[291.039s] ain&#39;t doing too well is it so nice to
[292.68s] have a gen in the backyard you got it
[294.28s] exactly okay the other one is Intel I
[296.6s] noticed that it&#39;s got to 21 I say this
[298.8s] every day in it&#39;s got to $21 a share or
[301.68s] it&#39;s reached 20 is it a buy it is a buy
[304.68s] you know it&#39;s G down a lot it&#39;s trading
[306.68s] a tangible book okay the government has
[308.8s] back stopped this they need Intel&#39;s
[310.8s] Foundry to succeed to compete with
[312.759s] Taiwan semiconductor so they&#39;ve given
[314.72s] them money they&#39;re going to stand behind
[316.08s] The Foundry and they announced today
[317.68s] they might separate The Foundry business
[319.759s] they&#39;re going to be activists around
[321.0s] this stock they&#39;ve hired someone to
[322.199s] defend against activists which means
[324.0s] stuff is going to start to happen so
[325.36s] they&#39;ve got their legacy business the
[327.0s] aipc business they&#39;re going to ship 40
[329.16s] million still a leader in that business
[331.52s] and the gouty 3 competes with the Nvidia
[334.919s] 100 chip it&#39;s half the price for twice
[338.0s] the performance 40% more energy
[340.12s] efficient so if you think Nvidia is
[341.479s] going to have a monopoly on this think
[342.919s] again we&#39;ve gone through the
[344.24s] semiconductor cycle sooner or later it
[346.199s] becomes a commodity product Intel is
[348.039s] going to be able to compete and chip
[349.28s] away at Nvidia going to get back to 30
[351.44s] or 35 I think over the next 12 to 24
[354.56s] months this stock can get not only to 30
[356.56s] I think the Legacy business excluding
[358.759s] the promise of GP pus I think their
[360.4s] legacy business alone is worth $40 a
[362.479s] share okay well take a look at it Tom
[365.88s] thanks for being here appreciate
[367.84s] it and we&#39;re back and then I had the
[371.199s] pleasure of
[372.56s] joining uh Sean calebs on cgtn America
[376.44s] thanks to Sean and T gabron for having
[378.759s] me on we&#39;ll listen in here okay lot to
[381.12s] unpack talking about the US economy and
[382.96s] for that we turn to Thomas Hayes he is
[385.12s] the founder chairman and managing member
[387.24s] of great Hill Capital at Equity
[389.08s] management company based in New York
[390.88s] Thomas great to have you on I certainly
[392.319s] appreciate it and a lot as I mentioned
[394.56s] to get to overall the report very
[396.72s] encouraging want to get your take away
[398.56s] from it uh American consumers obviously
[400.8s] spending do they have the money uh what
[403.52s] about this latest data what are the
[404.68s] bright spots and what areas if any do
[407.4s] you think are out there for a
[409.08s] concern well the good news Sean is that
[411.72s] when the US consumer has a job they
[414.52s] spend money you never want to bet
[415.879s] against the US consumer what we are
[418.12s] seeing in terms of mixed results is
[420.639s] companies like Dollar General that cater
[423.319s] to lower income consumers are really
[426.639s] getting hurt that stock had its biggest
[428.639s] one-day drop I believe ever today wow uh
[431.639s] because the lower-end consumer is
[433.12s] struggling a little bit little bit
[434.8s] you&#39;re seeing with the fast lower and
[436.759s] fast food restaurants in the value Wars
[439.759s] trying to offer lower and lower prices
[442.08s] for those consumers that are hurting the
[444.12s] most and then at the upper ends you saw
[446.199s] Best Buy today have one of its best days
[448.4s] ever because more and more people people
[449.68s] are buying AI PCS and refreshing their
[452.599s] PC Cycles so it&#39;s A Tale of Two Cities
[455.68s] but on balance we saw with that GDP
[457.52s] number things are generally okay let&#39;s
[461.8s] talk a bit more about The Tale of Two
[463.639s] Cities because anytime you have a wealth
[465.759s] Gap that&#39;s obviously a reason uh for
[468.199s] concern what about the do-it-yourself
[470.28s] operations Home Depot entities such as
[472.84s] that because frequently when times are
[475.4s] tough people will try to do it
[477.199s] themselves rather than hire out a
[479.0s] contractor do we see anything like
[482.0s] that yeah I think these will do well
[484.72s] they&#39;re kind of insulated their
[486.0s] businesses are broad enough but what&#39;s
[487.599s] really going to benefit the Home Depot
[490.12s] and the Lowe&#39;s of the world uh and even
[492.479s] some of the companies that are suppliers
[494.159s] there like the Stanley Black and Deckers
[496.319s] the gener is lower interest rates that
[499.36s] is going to reignite housing that&#39;s
[501.919s] going to reignite projects that&#39;s going
[504.12s] to reignite construction that is a big
[507.319s] deal that&#39;s coming to a theater near you
[509.8s] the FED is going to start cutting in
[511.759s] September and they are going to be one
[513.479s] of the initial immediate beneficiaries
[516.36s] well for all those folks out there who
[517.64s] do work construction that&#39;s great news
[519.2s] for them let&#39;s talk about the data for
[520.919s] the labor markets as well clean energy
[522.959s] jobs doing well but what&#39;s the overall
[525.519s] state of the labor market right now
[526.959s] especially given other recent
[528.519s] information that shows the US economy
[530.12s] simply did not add as many
[532.24s] jobs any kind of jobs good jobs or or or
[535.519s] however you want to classify it as
[537.48s] previous readings
[539.68s] yeah that was a big shocker for a lot of
[541.92s] people the 800 18,000 downward revision
[545.8s] over the year uh what we&#39;re finding
[548.44s] though is the Fed has a dual mandate and
[551.72s] they&#39;ve now shifted their focus uh they
[554.279s] were exclusively F I would say
[556.279s] exclusively F focused on inflation they
[558.76s] have now shifted and what&#39;s caused them
[560.44s] to move is their concerns about the
[563.68s] labor market the initial jobless claims
[566.48s] that Karina mentioned while it came in
[568.76s] better than they are elevated and the
[571.44s] FED has their eye on it and that&#39;s why
[572.839s] they&#39;re going to go in September because
[574.56s] that is a lot harder to recover once it
[576.88s] starts falling apart okay we also know
[578.72s] wages have coming up in in the past year
[581.12s] or so but the price of groceries has
[583.12s] gone up 21% the price overall of of
[586.0s] goods about 19% but still the economy
[588.32s] has been boosted by this consumer
[589.72s] spending it comes as a surprise given
[592.279s] the prices that I just talked about so
[594.92s] what is driving consumers uh is this
[597.56s] their confidence out there that we&#39;re
[598.839s] going to turn the
[600.399s] corner I think there&#39;s something to to
[603.32s] that that number one they have jobs
[605.519s] number two they are deleveraged if you
[607.76s] look at The deleveraging Debt Service as
[610.279s] a percentage of disposable income uh
[612.88s] it&#39;s really fallen off of a cliff since
[615.68s] 2009 it&#39;s come down and down and down
[617.76s] the moral of the story is people have a
[619.76s] lot less debt they have a lot more cash
[622.68s] and albeit there is a demographic at the
[625.279s] lower end that&#39;s starting to struggle
[627.24s] and we&#39;re seeing default Spike up and
[629.32s] auto loans and things like that by and
[631.279s] large 80 some OD perc of the population
[634.04s] is doing generally okay but a little bit
[637.079s] worried and that&#39;s why the FED is taking
[638.839s] a move they don&#39;t want to see layoff
[641.12s] start uh there had been some data out
[643.48s] two weeks ago that the unemployment rate
[645.6s] if you back out the immigration could be
[648.399s] as potentially as low as 3.6
[651.079s] 3.7% uh it&#39;s the immigration that has uh
[654.079s] caused the 4.3% print as of present you
[657.2s] know we really can&#39;t talk about all this
[658.68s] new data with without talking about the
[660.24s] upcoming US election uh KLA Harris has
[663.399s] made it clear she really wants to Target
[665.04s] price couging uh Donald Trump has been
[667.04s] looking overseas uh wants more tariffs
[669.76s] especially on China uh coming in what
[671.88s] are your thoughts on the US race what
[673.92s] are people looking at to distinguish
[676.68s] themselves from an economic standpoint
[678.839s] from these two
[680.16s] candidates well look the name of the
[682.079s] game is as as it relates to stock
[684.079s] markets and generally the economy is
[686.48s] everyone does better when there&#39;s
[687.92s] gridlock I.E
[689.959s] no one power has no one party has too
[692.6s] much power so uh as it relates to uh
[696.519s] taxing unrealized capital gains that&#39;s a
[698.6s] bad idea if I was going to write a book
[700.36s] called How to cause a Great Depression
[702.2s] the first chapter one would be entitled
[704.12s] let&#39;s start taxing unrealized Capital
[705.959s] but isn&#39;t that some but hang on a second
[707.56s] isn&#39;t that taken out of context to a
[709.04s] degree because as I understand it it&#39;s
[710.76s] just aimed at people who have $100
[712.12s] million or more yeah and the people that
[715.0s] have $100 million or more are the people
[716.88s] who invest in companies that create jobs
[719.24s] and if you take away their incentive to
[720.839s] invest in companies you&#39;re going to have
[722.2s] a lot less jobs so I don&#39;t think that
[724.16s] will get through Congress so I don&#39;t
[725.48s] think that&#39;s a material thing uh as it
[727.92s] relates to Trump on the other hand uh
[730.16s] threatening tariffs he did the same
[731.6s] thing in his first term what we saw was
[734.079s] that Chinese relations uh certainly
[736.32s] Chinese stocks did a lot better under
[738.16s] the Trump Administration than they did
[739.68s] under the Biden Administration uh they
[742.0s] actually had one of their worst crashes
[743.36s] ever under the Biden Administration so I
[745.56s] think the jury is out often times if you
[747.72s] make bets based on politic I you lose
[750.36s] everyone thought energy stocks would do
[752.199s] well under Trump they underperformed
[754.04s] they did well under Biden everyone
[755.44s] thought solar stocks would go to zero
[757.32s] under Trump they actually did quite well
[759.0s] they did poorly under Biden so I
[760.92s] wouldn&#39;t make your bets on uh politics I
[763.88s] would make your bets on the fact that
[765.519s] earnings continue to grow estimates are
[767.68s] up fif for plus 15% for next year so on
[771.199s] balance as long as we have checks and
[772.76s] balances and one party does not win all
[775.16s] three branches we&#39;re going to be just
[777.079s] okay okay Thomas Hayes good stuff is
[778.839s] always we can&#39;t thank you enough we
[780.279s] appreciate it thank you
[790.92s] Sean and we&#39;re back and then finally I
[794.519s] got a call from Mike lson uh wanted me
[797.68s] to join him on the money Show podcast
[800.68s] this week which was phenomenal uh really
[803.399s] enjoyed talking with Mike he always puts
[805.44s] out great stuff we&#39;re going to listen in
[807.639s] here I think we&#39;re setting up very close
[809.88s] to a situation like 2001 to 2007 where
[813.6s] where Tech underperformed we&#39;re not
[815.36s] going to crash like we did back then
[816.8s] because we they actually have earnings
[818.04s] power but underperformed and uh some of
[821.32s] these groups outperform as the dollar
[823.35s] [Music]
[828.92s] weakend hello and welcome to our latest
[831.079s] money show Money Masters podcast segment
[833.519s] Mike Larson editor-in Chief at money
[835.199s] show 2024 has been a strong year for the
[837.839s] stock market we&#39;re seeing a lot more
[839.48s] volatility in August and September today
[841.56s] we have a huge list of potential Market
[843.56s] catalysts right around the corner that
[845.399s] includes the first likely Federal
[846.72s] Reserve interest rate cut in four plus
[848.759s] years and of course the upcoming
[850.519s] presidential election joining me to cut
[852.639s] through the Clutter and give you some
[853.839s] actional opinions about what is likely
[855.639s] to happen is Tom Hayes Tom is founder
[858.36s] chairman and managing member of great
[859.959s] Hill Capital as well as the man behind
[861.8s] the informative and entertaining Market
[863.519s] commentary site hedge fund tips Tom how
[866.04s] are you I&#39;m doing great good to good to
[867.839s] be with you Mike yeah I&#39;m glad to have
[869.92s] you here I mean gez a lot going on in
[871.44s] the market so I guess I kind of have to
[872.839s] start with the most obvious question
[874.519s] right is September going to be one of
[875.92s] those moments where we all want to run
[877.12s] and hide or do you think this seasonally
[878.959s] weak period for markets talk is a
[880.92s] littleit overblown you know it&#39;s
[883.16s] interesting uh when everyone&#39;s looking
[885.24s] for correction is when you usually don&#39;t
[887.16s] get it you know we we&#39;ve been of the
[888.839s] view that it could get a little choppy
[890.959s] in late September and early October I
[893.12s] think the I think the potential surprise
[895.36s] here Mike uh is that
[899.16s] the jobs report should come in in a
[902.48s] fashion on Friday that will cement the
[905.759s] FED doing obviously the 25 basis points
[908.519s] and maybe 50 basis points but more
[910.279s] likely 25 no matter how bad the jobs
[912.279s] report is on Friday and we&#39;ve got two
[916.56s] coincident factors number one is the
[919.16s] election year seasonality if you look
[921.8s] back to World War II uh it tends to
[924.56s] actually be markets tend to be strong
[926.759s] into mid September not September 1st
[930.639s] midt uh that doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s going to
[932.8s] work uh exactly that way this year but
[935.68s] the other thing that we notice is when a
[938.759s] Fed starts the easing cycle the first
[940.92s] cut has a high propensity to be a buy
[944.959s] the rumor sell the news so our base case
[949.6s] is actually that we start to see some
[953.04s] strength into that first cut so you know
[956.519s] maybe yesterday and today being a oneoff
[959.24s] uh the short-term volatility we get the
[961.519s] jobs report people start to look forward
[963.12s] to the cut and maybe we even touch you
[965.519s] know we did with the Dow or relook at
[969.12s] near New highs on the S&amp;P and then we
[973.56s] move into that normal pre-election
[976.279s] Jitters from late September through the
[978.88s] end of October which will be an
[980.839s] opportunity to buy into a yearend rally
[983.959s] uh that is fostered by a hopeful
[987.12s] gridlock outcome irrespective of who&#39;s
[989.959s] elected not having one power with
[992.6s] absolute one party with absolute control
[995.12s] is the key for the stock market got it
[997.8s] got it well let&#39;s talk a little bit
[999.0s] about the the fed and kind of the
[1000.68s] economic news I mean as we&#39;re speaking
[1002.12s] we just got a pretty lousy looking jolts
[1003.959s] report you know we won&#39;t have the NFP by
[1006.16s] the time this this airs um but we&#39;ve
[1008.36s] seen some some squishier softer numbers
[1010.68s] not terribly recessionary in my opinion
[1013.199s] uh of late so how do you think that you
[1014.959s] know the FED reacts what do you see them
[1016.36s] doing again in September and maybe as we
[1018.04s] roll into the final couple of meetings
[1019.839s] here in
[1021.24s] 2024 yeah I I you know Jay Powell has a
[1024.439s] history of not liking to shock markets I
[1026.559s] think he learned that early on in
[1028.16s] December of 2018 when he said autopilot
[1031.199s] and by Christmas Eve everyone was
[1032.679s] wondering if uh the stock market was
[1034.36s] going to fall through the floor it fell
[1036.199s] something like 19% like overnight uh I
[1039.079s] was at Disneyland looking at my cell
[1040.72s] phone like what the hell is he doing uh
[1043.4s] and fortunately uh minutian stepped in
[1046.559s] and got the banks together and and
[1048.16s] recovered everything so since then he
[1050.36s] tends to avoid major surprises and um in
[1055.08s] that on that basis I think he&#39;s going to
[1057.44s] do 25 even if the jobs report is weak
[1061.0s] and from there uh we could see uh the
[1064.4s] Market&#39;s pricing in a 100 this year I
[1067.16s] don&#39;t know you know that would kind of
[1069.2s] concern me in the sense that if they do
[1071.84s] a 50 cut maybe the economy is a little
[1074.76s] worse than everyone expects maybe it&#39;s
[1076.88s] not a soft Landing so base case is
[1079.96s] actually uh more conservative 50 to 75 I
[1084.12s] think 75 probably gets done 25
[1087.44s] 2525 uh and then we see where it is uh
[1090.4s] in you know
[1092.4s] 2025 got it you know one of the things
[1095.32s] obviously I follow your work at hedge
[1096.559s] fund tips it&#39;s fantastic everybody who&#39;s
[1098.72s] watching this please make sure you sign
[1100.159s] up for some of that commentary because
[1101.24s] it&#39;s very insightful and enjoyable one
[1104.28s] thing I know you&#39;ve been talking about
[1105.44s] there and elsewhere is the rotation that
[1107.48s] we&#39;ve seen in this market for the last
[1109.08s] couple of months right I mean it was an
[1110.679s] alltech all the time market for a while
[1112.64s] since July that&#39;s been changing what do
[1114.799s] you think&#39;s going on there and what do
[1116.12s] you think that means going
[1117.76s] forward I think it&#39;s very very healthy
[1120.28s] the market is broadening out and it&#39;s
[1122.919s] not just some hope like we&#39;ve had some
[1125.4s] fake outs in the past this time it&#39;s
[1128.24s] actually uh backstopped and
[1130.84s] substantiated by the trends in earnings
[1133.72s] you know you had the Magnificent Seven
[1135.64s] earnings growth in the first quarter of
[1137.559s] this year was
[1140.28s] 50% uh that&#39;s dropping down to 18 to 20%
[1145.48s] by by fourth quarter of this year uh and
[1148.799s] year on year it&#39;ll go from 30% this year
[1151.6s] to 18% next year at the same time the
[1156.12s] unmagnify in the first half of this year
[1158.28s] had negative earnings growth so when
[1160.84s] people say well why are only seven
[1162.48s] stocks performing because only seven
[1164.24s] stocks have meaningful enough earnings
[1166.36s] growth to perform that is changing
[1168.88s] that&#39;s now inflecting to positive
[1171.36s] earnings growth and that&#39;s why you&#39;re
[1172.96s] starting to see the broadening that&#39;s
[1174.32s] why you&#39;re starting to see the movement
[1175.52s] under the surface small caps for
[1177.919s] instance uh expected to grow 7% earnings
[1181.48s] growth this year how about 37% earnings
[1185.159s] growth next year and that is also in
[1188.6s] line with the first six and 12 months
[1192.6s] after a f fed cut value outperforms
[1196.48s] growth in the first six month and small
[1199.2s] caps outperform large caps by over 11
[1203.4s] percentage points in the first 12 months
[1206.72s] after the first cut from the Federal
[1208.919s] Reserve that&#39;s some great insights there
[1211.0s] and I wanted to ask you you know while
[1212.4s] we&#39;re on that subject within sort of the
[1214.36s] the small cap space or some of the
[1216.36s] non-tech sectors is what looks
[1218.24s] particularly attractive to you I mean is
[1219.6s] it financials is it industrial something
[1221.64s] else that you&#39;re
[1222.6s] watching it&#39;s across the board you know
[1225.28s] we specialize in turnarounds my nickname
[1227.799s] is kind of turnaround Tom uh you know
[1230.84s] one company that&#39;s not a small cap it&#39;s
[1232.919s] not a dividend pair you know the groups
[1235.159s] that tend to outperform after the first
[1236.919s] cut uh we&#39;ve got a weakening dollar we
[1238.799s] got lower rates so that means uh
[1241.039s] Emerging Market should do better it
[1242.88s] means small cap should do better it
[1245.08s] means dividend payers should do better
[1248.88s] uh and and it means value should do
[1251.48s] better and I think one of the stocks
[1253.36s] that has become a value stock is called
[1256.0s] uh that we own is called PayPal and and
[1258.24s] we own it lower from from these levels
[1260.08s] it&#39;s had a recent move but we think just
[1262.159s] getting started and the name of the game
[1264.24s] there is you know 490 some odd uh users
[1267.48s] around the world uh but more than that
[1270.24s] that this why is the stock down why why
[1272.6s] did the stock fall 80% from the uh covid
[1275.36s] highs is because margins were
[1277.24s] compressing and they got this new CEO in
[1280.72s] named Alex Chris he came from into it he
[1284.279s] uh ran 50% of the revenues there the
[1286.279s] small business division while he was
[1287.96s] there in 10 years the stock was a 38
[1289.919s] bagger he&#39;s going to apply some of those
[1291.72s] principles to PayPal and the first thing
[1293.6s] that he&#39;s focused on is something called
[1296.2s] Fast Lane so you have a business at the
[1299.2s] money show and what if I could tell you
[1302.159s] that uh instead of having 50% conversion
[1305.84s] when people check out to buy a ticket it
[1308.159s] goes to 80% conversion and it reduces
[1311.919s] the amount of time that they&#39;re on the
[1314.0s] site uh and and closes the conversion
[1316.48s] that much faster would you be willing
[1319.039s] to pay brain tree or PayPal
[1322.72s] 2.2% take rate versus 2.0% take rate if
[1327.32s] your uh conversion went from 50 to 80%
[1330.279s] would that make sense for you as a
[1331.36s] business person yeah sounds exciting
[1333.559s] complete complete no-brainer and it&#39;s
[1335.52s] gotten so good that it&#39;s not even just
[1338.88s] PayPal using it now their competitors
[1341.32s] like Aiden which is one of the biggest
[1343.12s] payment processors in Europe uh is now
[1345.76s] licensing the fast lane checkout from
[1348.799s] PayPal uh ferve which is a multi-billion
[1352.279s] dollar company is licensing that service
[1355.32s] from PayPal so what&#39;s happening margins
[1357.96s] are reaccelerating and you know he came
[1360.6s] in and cleared the deck he&#39;s he&#39;s uh uh
[1363.52s] barely coming on one year and um you
[1367.2s] know he he basically took took
[1369.12s] expectations down he said we&#39;re going to
[1371.36s] do five billion of free cash for we&#39;ll
[1373.12s] buy back five billion of stock well he
[1374.72s] just came out this quarter and he said
[1376.559s] you know that five billion I I I got
[1378.279s] that wrong we&#39;re actually going to
[1379.84s] generate billion of free cash flow this
[1382.76s] year and we&#39;re going to buy $6 billion
[1385.76s] worth of stock then you got this other
[1388.0s] business called venmo which is basically
[1390.48s] the kleenex of peer-to-peer payments
[1393.32s] that&#39;s growing like a weed they&#39;ve got a
[1395.32s] a a venmo for teens that&#39;s growing like
[1398.12s] a weed and there&#39;s a lot to do there so
[1400.48s] it&#39;s really just the beginning so some
[1401.88s] of these Fallen Angels uh are really a
[1405.52s] tremendous opportunity here I I love you
[1408.64s] brought up the turnaround Tom nickname
[1410.039s] I&#39;m going to get to that in a second
[1411.4s] towards the end but I wanted to ask
[1412.96s] first uh you know you&#39;ve you&#39;ve been a
[1415.6s] proponent of some looking outside of us
[1417.6s] borders at some of the cheaper stocks
[1419.12s] you can find around the world even in a
[1420.64s] place like China which had fallen out of
[1422.36s] favor for a long time are we at the
[1424.08s] point where that you know those types of
[1425.679s] markets are going to play catchup here
[1427.88s] if so why and what would you do about it
[1430.279s] yeah so uh two two things uh 100%
[1434.559s] dollars weakening yields are coming down
[1436.559s] that is a magic formula for Emerging
[1438.919s] Markets I think we&#39;re setting up very
[1440.96s] close to a situation like 2001 to 2007
[1444.72s] where where Tech underperformed we&#39;re
[1446.64s] not going to crash like we did back then
[1448.2s] because we they actually have earnings
[1449.4s] power but
[1450.32s] underperformed and uh some of these
[1452.799s] groups outperform as the dollar weakend
[1455.12s] so uh China we want exposure and look
[1459.0s] we&#39;ve been bagged in this Alibaba for a
[1461.4s] year and a half it&#39;s been dead money
[1463.48s] completely done nothing but uh I think
[1466.44s] the time is now and alibaba&#39;s proxy for
[1469.159s] emerging markets but more than that a
[1470.919s] proxy for China it&#39;s the national
[1473.2s] champion and something very important
[1475.64s] just happened the shareholders voted on
[1478.84s] August 22nd to approve a dual primary
[1482.64s] listing in Hong Kong that enables it to
[1485.919s] join the southbound connect on September
[1488.64s] 9th what does that mean it means for the
[1491.12s] first time ever mainland China investors
[1494.64s] and there are 220 million of them they
[1497.76s] anticipate about 180 million as a
[1500.48s] potential Market to buy Alibaba stock uh
[1503.36s] will be able to buy Alibaba stock for
[1505.799s] the first time ever starting September
[1508.0s] 9th what&#39;s more important than that is
[1510.919s] that alibaba&#39;s got about 80 billion
[1513.48s] dollars of cash on their balance sheet
[1515.84s] and rather than they couldn&#39;t get that
[1518.039s] cash out of China to do buyback so they
[1519.96s] would have to issue non-dilutive
[1522.52s] convertible uh stock uh in order to get
[1525.84s] US dollars to buy the stock back back
[1528.559s] even though they had $80 billion sitting
[1530.08s] at home they will now be able to buy
[1532.88s] back stock through the southbound
[1534.84s] connect and you see just in the last few
[1536.96s] days since that dual primary listing was
[1538.96s] approved uh that they&#39;re reporting how
[1541.559s] much stock that they&#39;re buying back and
[1542.96s] we&#39;re going to see that accelerate so I
[1545.679s] think look uh you know everyone feels
[1548.08s] that China&#39;s uninvestable but if you
[1549.559s] look at the Hang sang for the last 20
[1552.08s] years you have these huge Corrections
[1555.559s] every two to four years and uh the
[1558.44s] bigger the correction the longer it
[1559.799s] takes usually takes about two years to
[1562.32s] build the base but when it turns and it
[1565.039s] starts to move up it tends to be
[1566.44s] parabolic and you know you got to keep
[1567.919s] in mind through all the noise the
[1570.039s] country is still growing at 5% GDP and
[1572.36s] and here we are American exceptionalism
[1574.799s] no question about it but we&#39;re growing
[1576.36s] at two and a half percent. so there&#39;s
[1578.52s] opportunity there they will recover and
[1581.24s] I think demographically speaking they&#39;ve
[1583.2s] got another huge parabolic run before
[1586.279s] maybe they do run out of time three to
[1588.96s] five years out like Japan did in the
[1591.52s] late 80s because they didn&#39;t make enough
[1594.039s] babies for for so long but for now
[1596.52s] they&#39;ve got a huge portion of their
[1598.24s] population age 34 and their spending
[1600.48s] should should increase and uh Peak out
[1602.679s] at around age 40 got it Tom uh you&#39;re
[1605.559s] gonna be joining us for the 24 money
[1607.36s] Show Master Symposium in Sarasota this
[1609.44s] December um you know we talked about
[1611.12s] this sort of turnaround approach I just
[1612.559s] want to know when it comes to
[1613.399s] methodology why do you find that style
[1615.32s] of investing so attractive and what do
[1617.039s] you think people were looking look to be
[1618.88s] value investors or turnaround investors
[1620.6s] need to know when it comes to pointers
[1622.039s] or
[1622.799s] advice well number one uh a stock that
[1625.799s] falls 90% can fall another 50% before
[1628.48s] you get a five bagger so so it&#39;s uh uh
[1631.44s] there&#39;s something to be said there but
[1632.919s] what we like is we&#39;re we&#39;re not predict
[1636.0s] the next great thing people we are
[1638.08s] buying durable business that have been
[1639.84s] down around through many cycles and have
[1642.039s] have had multiple turnaround situations
[1644.799s] and have proven they have a durable Mo
[1646.799s] so even when the stock&#39;s down 60 or 80%
[1649.159s] or whatever it happens to be when we&#39;re
[1651.0s] getting involved we we&#39;re looking and
[1652.679s] we&#39;re seeing okay well the free cash
[1654.64s] flow and the revenues are kind of
[1656.2s] holding in there or in some cases they
[1658.799s] might might be down modestly they&#39;re not
[1660.32s] down 80% that I can assure you uh
[1662.96s] revenues are usually flat are growing
[1665.44s] and uh and free cash flow is usually
[1667.84s] positive and then you get some Catalyst
[1670.32s] with a new CEO that has talent to take
[1673.159s] this beautiful Legacy franchise that has
[1675.24s] been through multiple cycle Cycles over
[1677.24s] decades and turn it turn it back into
[1679.519s] something great and we like it because
[1682.799s] uh the margin of safety is much greater
[1685.36s] once we have comfort with the balance
[1686.919s] sheet Etc that we can make a double or
[1688.64s] triple in a handful of years versus uh
[1692.24s] business that&#39;s already up quite a bit
[1694.0s] you know we we had talked about uh you
[1696.399s] may have caught our note in uh June of
[1700.799s] this year when we said envidia was the
[1703.0s] new pain trade you can look it up on the
[1704.88s] website it was like June 22nd that day
[1708.72s] uh it opened at 136 it went up to 140
[1712.919s] against us and has since Fallen about 30
[1715.6s] 40% uh because you know it&#39;s a great
[1718.32s] business but at $3.2 trillion valuation
[1722.44s] when you have a a total GDP of 28
[1725.799s] trillion and an expected growth rate
[1728.36s] from the sell side of 40% a year what
[1730.48s] they&#39;re basically trying to convince you
[1732.36s] is that it&#39;s going to be half of GDP in
[1734.6s] four years which is absolutely makes no
[1736.96s] sense if you&#39;re interested and believe
[1738.679s] in something called math so um you know
[1742.24s] so those are the type of things that we
[1744.919s] avoid and uh and and other things that
[1748.039s] we can have a sense of certainty two
[1750.36s] three years out we can make a double or
[1751.76s] triple if it&#39;s a smaller business
[1753.519s] sometimes we can make a multibagger got
[1755.6s] it got it well just one last question I
[1757.08s] guess um you know beyond what we&#39;ve
[1758.399s] talked about here any other sneak peek
[1759.919s] or uh you know tidbits about what you
[1761.799s] think you might be talking about in
[1762.799s] Sarasota I know December&#39;s still a few
[1764.2s] months off so it&#39;s a little bit tough
[1765.76s] who knows what the market will do
[1766.84s] between now and then all I can tell you
[1769.36s] is in the
[1771.24s] unmagnify there are tremendous
[1773.519s] opportunities still that have been
[1775.84s] created by once in a 100y year event
[1777.72s] called covid and these are durable
[1779.679s] multi-decade franchises so we&#39;re going
[1781.44s] to talk about a few of our ideas for
[1783.08s] 2025 we&#39;re very excited about that we&#39;re

[1826.559s] got it sounds good take care Tom
[1829.05s] [Music]
[1832.64s] bye-bye
[1833.95s] [Music]
[1835.2s] and I want to go
[1838.88s] through couple of things now that we&#39;ve
[1842.12s] uh as many of you have been following us
[1844.919s] uh we bought a lot of uh Amazon in
[1848.519s] October of uh 2022 and then again in
[1852.399s] March of uh
[1855.519s] 2023 that has more than double we took
[1858.44s] off a uh the majority of the position in
[1862.08s] uh July as we talked about on the
[1864.2s] podcast and we&#39;ve taken off the rest of
[1867.0s] the
[1867.84s] position uh in um in the last week so
[1872.12s] you know Blended out of the thing
[1874.6s] somewhere around 190 and we got in down
[1877.32s] here so that&#39;s more than a double in a
[1878.96s] year and a half and some of these things
[1881.639s] uh you
[1883.279s] know
[1884.88s] they like like this one only took you
[1887.48s] know B basically a year and a half some
[1890.08s] of these work really really fast and
[1891.88s] others work more slowly and that&#39;s the
[1893.88s] name of the game well let&#39;s to look at
[1895.36s] anothers that we harvested we talked
[1897.44s] that we had sold out of uh um uh Bank of
[1901.519s] America I mean this was nearly a double
[1903.96s] off the lows uh and we took off the
[1906.799s] final 25% around 40 so Blended you know
[1911.36s] 401 two three range uh and that&#39;s not
[1916.08s] quite a double from the lows but that
[1918.279s] was a good trade and then city were
[1920.44s] fully out of uh this was a monster lows
[1923.32s] were 36 in
[1925.639s] change
[1927.639s] um uh we had some in the 30s some in the
[1930.159s] low 40s and um took off most of that and
[1934.08s] took off the rest this week at you know
[1936.559s] in the around 60 so that was close to a
[1939.36s] double and again these are this one was
[1941.44s] less than a year or or just a little bit
[1944.279s] over a year rather and you know whether
[1946.919s] it&#39;s so you just see over and over the
[1949.48s] framework works sometimes it takes
[1952.2s] longer sometimes okay now Google is one
[1955.32s] that we took off the majority of the
[1956.96s] position again in July perfectly timed
[1959.519s] right after we put that article out on
[1961.6s] Nvidia where we said uh the next pain
[1964.76s] trade and we had the picture of Jensen
[1967.72s] Wong signing some fans uh breast with
[1971.44s] his signature and and the stock that day
[1974.36s] opened at 136 went to 139 it since
[1976.919s] collapsed close to 100 it&#39;s bouncing
[1979.159s] around the bottom um so we got R out of
[1981.84s] most of Google at that we we still have
[1986.639s] that 25 30% tiny small stub in Google
[1991.0s] we&#39;re not going to sell Down in the Hole
[1992.88s] here but on the next strength up to 170
[1996.84s] 180 maybe it makes new highs if we get a
[1999.6s] rally into the the uh first cut but I
[2002.76s] doubt it uh will&#39;ll probably extinguish
[2005.159s] the rest of that position so again you
[2007.88s] see here late October 2022 and then
[2011.639s] again in March of 2023 when it was down
[2013.799s] at 90 you know got up to 190 when we
[2016.88s] were talking about it in July uh 180 and
[2020.36s] now it&#39;s at 160 again no matter where
[2022.799s] you slice it more than a double year and
[2025.12s] a half the framework continues to work
[2028.399s] uh smtc entered below 20 we took off the
[2032.88s] full position uh with a for handle some
[2035.96s] in July some in the last week uh same
[2040.24s] with uh C limited the reason we took
[2043.48s] this one off that one has gone from
[2046.48s] 32 uh lows to 83 and
[2050.24s] change uh we don&#39;t like the business
[2053.879s] enough and we have enough exposure to
[2055.639s] Asia e-commerce through Alibaba so we
[2059.56s] just booked that and then uh 3M we
[2062.28s] already told you uh this has been a
[2064.639s] monster we took we got out of this at
[2066.72s] 125 it went up to 135 now it&#39;s back to
[2070.76s] 130 uh would we consider reing this
[2074.599s] below 100 yes may we get that
[2077.24s] opportunity we don&#39;t know but again this
[2080.0s] is a huge move in a relatively short
[2082.919s] period of time and you book The win so
[2084.839s] the framework works over and over and
[2086.72s] over and sometimes it goes against you
[2088.44s] before it goes for you as a matter of
[2089.839s] fact every time it goes against you
[2091.159s] before it goes for you if you&#39;re doing a
[2093.28s] good job and um so so just some updates
[2097.28s] there now we&#39;ve got a tremendous amount
[2099.68s] of data and now we&#39;ve got our new batch
[2102.0s] that are bouncing around the lows and
[2103.72s] they&#39;re going to be our next batch of
[2105.28s] harvesting in the next year year and a
[2107.119s] half we&#39;re going to be doing this type
[2109.0s] of stuff for those of you who&#39;ve been
[2110.56s] following along and it&#39;s just going to
[2112.2s] work I mean 3M looked like it would
[2113.96s] never work in a million years by the way
[2115.359s] we still own all the svent that we got
[2117.52s] for free uh so that&#39;s exciting for for
[2120.599s] that and
[2122.599s] um all right so uh sentiment survey D
[2126.28s] data this came in at 45% bullish 24%
[2129.76s] bearish so look there&#39;s some bullishness
[2132.2s] it&#39;s being taken out of the market I
[2134.359s] think the look it all comes down to the
[2136.56s] jobs report I think the jobs report is
[2140.079s] going to come
[2141.28s] in uh week enough for to to to give
[2146.28s] people no doubt in their mind that the
[2148.28s] fed&#39;s going at least 25 possibly 50 I
[2151.359s] don&#39;t think they go 50 as I talked about
[2153.8s] with Mike because um he doesn&#39;t want to
[2156.8s] shock the market
[2158.359s] but I mean if it was unbelievably weak
[2161.52s] they might do 50 that would probably not
[2163.52s] be good for the market I think it&#39;s
[2165.4s] going to be um Goldilocks not too hot
[2169.48s] not too cold enough to guarantee the 25
[2172.76s] and if that&#39;s turns out to be correct
[2175.079s] tomorrow and maybe the unemployment rate
[2177.0s] goes from 43 to 42 as as
[2180.56s] expected um we get the 25 it looks like
[2184.839s] the world&#39;s not falling apart and I
[2187.16s] think we probably see Equity strength
[2191.319s] into the first cut uh which would be a
[2194.96s] week and a half two weeks of super
[2196.96s] strength to suck every last person back
[2199.68s] in until we fall into some serious
[2202.079s] seasonal weakness both from an election
[2203.64s] year standpoint and a sell sell the news
[2206.44s] so uh we will use any of that strength
[2209.76s] to raise some more cash from some of our
[2212.64s] winners uh and be ready to either
[2215.72s] tactically hedge or have that catch
[2217.68s] ready to deploy in late October early
[2220.48s] November right before we get the
[2222.44s] election uh uh clearing up and end of
[2225.079s] year monster rally is our
[2227.4s] expectation uh auto sales volume thanks
[2230.079s] to Allen over there you know uh here
[2234.92s] is August numbers uh we&#39;re really
[2240.24s] uh August
[2242.4s] numbers to be announced so they they
[2245.76s] have been moving you know
[2248.079s] they were at 158 I think they&#39;re at
[2251.48s] 151 now which is not ideal but what do
[2254.96s] we have happening we have rates having
[2260.319s] rates coming down uh starting in um 20
[2265.599s] starting in two weeks and you have
[2268.96s] incentives going up and as we move to
[2271.88s] the end of the year because of all the
[2273.359s] EV inventories and all that stuff
[2275.079s] they&#39;re going to just fire sale it start
[2277.92s] doing 10 15 10 12% incentives certainly
[2282.079s] on the EVs and probably 8 9% incentives
[2285.88s] on the regular cars which means in in
[2289.52s] round terms a $50,000 car is going to
[2291.88s] cost you
[2293.04s] $45,000 and rates are going to be lower
[2295.599s] and they&#39;re going to incentivize that in
[2297.2s] anticipation of maybe 100 basis points
[2300.16s] lower uh so you know you could see a
[2302.48s] situation where as we move towards the
[2305.56s] end of the year you see a lot of
[2308.4s] uh car ads that look something like this
[2310.96s] MSRP 50,000 5,000 incentives net 45,000
[2315.72s] 2.9% APR and that&#39;s going to get people
[2319.2s] off the couch that&#39;s going to get a lot
[2321.8s] of uh uh inventories flush through and
[2325.359s] that&#39;s going to get production ramping
[2326.8s] back up which is what we need to see to
[2329.96s] get the operating leverage humming in
[2332.119s] Cooper standard which we will US market
[2334.68s] breath is improving relative performance
[2337.52s] S&amp;P equal weighted index has risen from
[2339.68s] the lows uh that&#39;s why a lot of these
[2341.96s] names have been big winners for us and
[2345.44s] we are going to uh look at that City
[2348.04s] chart that&#39;s amazing uh and we have
[2350.52s] harvested those 3M I mean it&#39;s it&#39;s uh
[2354.76s] it&#39;s it&#39;s exciting to see th those
[2356.839s] working and I&#39;m more excited to see the
[2359.72s] ones that we have are going to be much
[2361.68s] bigger uh in aggregate than than uh even
[2365.079s] those election years are different
[2367.599s] average Dow Jones Industrial monthly
[2370.0s] return since
[2371.319s] 1896 uh don&#39;t love going back to 1896
[2376.599s] because the post pre-World War II data
[2380.079s] tends to be skewed however what they&#39;re
[2383.119s] implying here is that in all years
[2387.72s] including election year September is uh
[2390.96s] 1% on average in election years it&#39;s
[2394.28s] better than um uh uh it&#39;s a positive
[2399.319s] month barely a positive month but a
[2401.56s] positive
[2403.52s] month uh
[2406.96s] so so that&#39;s that okay what 2024 looks
[2411.04s] like a lot like 2023 that&#39;s from
[2412.92s] Dietrich over at Carson I don&#39;t think
[2415.2s] that&#39;s really relevant but it it does
[2417.48s] look similar in which case it would be
[2419.16s] weakness into the end of October which
[2420.96s] is our base case followed by super uh
[2423.88s] strong year end rally I just think we&#39;re
[2426.119s] going to see a little bit of strength
[2427.839s] before that first cut and the Catalyst
[2430.64s] will probably be my guess is tomorrow&#39;s
[2434.319s] jobs report so here is more seasonality
[2438.24s] from
[2439.839s] 1976 through 2023 this is a presidential
[2444.4s] year and you do see a big popup here
[2450.2s] into uh mid to late September before the
[2453.56s] rollover into late October prior to the
[2456.72s] election and that is more in line with
[2459.28s] how we&#39;re thinking about it let&#39;s see
[2461.28s] what happens August does well in
[2463.599s] election years yeah we know that but uh
[2466.72s] so what they&#39;re saying here is
[2469.0s] September uh is a little weaker and that
[2471.96s] would be
[2472.96s] correct uh that also allows for the
[2476.88s] rally in late September and then a
[2478.68s] rollover before the end of the month
[2480.48s] which is what we like here&#39;s more good
[2484.0s] data from Carson this shows that that
[2487.88s] you do get this like early weakness and
[2490.76s] uncertainty and then a rally oddly into
[2493.599s] the 19th the FED meeting I believe is
[2496.0s] the 17th so this would be a natural
[2498.64s] moving back up to highs uh and then you
[2501.56s] just roll over after the 19th which um
[2504.64s] which is kind of how we&#39;re thinking
[2505.92s] about it does that mean we sell
[2507.24s] everything risk on risk off of course
[2509.0s] not most of our stuff uh now that we new
[2512.0s] new positions that we&#39;ve been able to
[2513.68s] put on it&#39;s so cheap it probably rallies
[2516.52s] when the market gets gets weak uh
[2518.72s] because money has to go somewhere as it
[2520.839s] rotates out of the mag 7 which will
[2522.96s] cause the market to uh to be weak in
[2526.119s] October because of the waiting GDP
[2528.72s] revisions from initial percentage uh
[2531.16s] consumer spending was the big thing that
[2533.16s] revised GDP up to
[2537.96s] 2.5% so everyone&#39;s saying that the uh
[2541.4s] GDP uh the consumer&#39;s dead it&#39;s not
[2544.24s] fully reflected I think in the case of
[2547.76s] you know the companies that have been
[2548.96s] hit Dollar General Dollar Tree Advanced
[2552.52s] Auto Parts by the way uh for sure uh by
[2556.28s] the lower-end consumer I think that was
[2559.079s] largely due to mismanagement the
[2560.76s] difference between Advanced Auto Parts
[2562.96s] and Dollar General and Dollar Tree is
[2565.559s] Advanced Auto Parts has a new jockey
[2567.28s] that&#39;s turning it around and they what&#39;s
[2570.44s] comical about the way the stock is
[2572.16s] acting right now and we&#39;ve taken
[2573.64s] advantage of it uh is that
[2578.11s] [Music]
[2581.079s] what um Shane o Kelly did in the last
[2585.599s] few weeks by selling off world pack is
[2589.319s] he took solvy risk off the table in
[2591.599s] other words bankruptcy is off the table
[2594.88s] okay and the stock was down from
[2596.48s] whatever 250 down to 60 or 50 now it&#39;s
[2600.64s] in the
[2601.599s] 40s
[2603.599s] um
[2605.64s] uh what with comp store sales Rising by
[2609.079s] the way and they&#39;re going to be using
[2610.68s] that money not just to pay down the debt
[2612.559s] which takes solvency risk off the table
[2614.48s] but to start to grow 100 new stores a
[2617.0s] year get back growth uh they&#39;ve they&#39;ve
[2620.28s] stabilized the existing business the
[2622.24s] market didn&#39;t like the soft guidance for
[2625.16s] the next two quarters same as Disney
[2627.76s] they didn&#39;t like the soft guidance for
[2629.2s] the next two quarters same as Dollar
[2631.48s] General same as Dollar Tree but it&#39;s
[2635.079s] temporary not permanent and don&#39;t count
[2637.48s] out this consumer as long as the fed&#39;s
[2640.2s] not too late and we believe so long as
[2642.559s] they go the
[2643.92s] 25 uh my our base case is 25 25 25 I
[2648.319s] would not be
[2650.16s] surprised if we do 75 to 100 and even
[2655.0s] though inflation is only you know is is
[2657.76s] much lower I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if
[2660.28s] they don&#39;t have to do more than 75 or
[2662.92s] 100 because I think inflation is going
[2665.839s] to oscillate between two and four and
[2669.319s] four and a half% for the next three to
[2670.96s] five years and they could probably hold
[2673.319s] the FED funds at 350 to four and get
[2676.04s] away with it um and that&#39;s the
[2679.839s] environment actually that value does
[2681.28s] well as well so um consumer spending
[2685.88s] contribution to GDP growth Services good
[2689.119s] look oh this is really interesting
[2690.599s] ladies and gentlemen this is what I was
[2692.44s] talking about dstock restock Goods
[2694.28s] demand is coming back and normalizing
[2697.44s] uh after it went negative in the first
[2699.599s] quarter it&#39;s back so that was our trough
[2702.16s] base case which was in fourth quarter of
[2704.8s] last year initial jobl claims climbing
[2707.48s] up that&#39;s why the FED is taking
[2711.28s] action uh let&#39;s see
[2715.44s] here yeah consumer spending still a big
[2717.92s] part of it S&amp;P monthly returns going
[2720.52s] back to 1928 again this really pre-World
[2724.599s] War II data is not terribly helped full
[2727.92s] uh with September being the worst month
[2729.559s] that&#39;s from the mly flu full down
[2733.2s] 1.17% on average US pending home sales
[2737.4s] at historic lows what&#39;s going to change
[2740.8s] very quickly to change that is you know
[2743.2s] here&#39;s the thing a lot of people have an
[2745.319s] enormous amount of equity Boomers
[2747.68s] trapped in their houses and they can&#39;t
[2749.359s] get out because they don&#39;t want to trade
[2751.0s] a 3% mortgage for a 7% mortgage well
[2754.48s] what&#39;s going to happen is
[2757.48s] mortgage rates are going to go in drop
[2759.559s] into a five handle pretty damn quickly
[2761.96s] maybe it&#39;s 5&#39;9 it doesn&#39;t matter it&#39;s
[2763.96s] it&#39;s uh psychological with the 5% and
[2768.119s] while they weren&#39;t willing to do 7%
[2770.16s] they&#39;re going to be willing to trade 3
[2773.04s] to five particularly if they book a
[2775.24s] seven fig profit on a house that they
[2777.52s] bought for you know an apple pie and two
[2779.8s] slices of ice cream 40 years ago is now
[2782.559s] worth a couple mil and maybe they&#39;ve
[2784.92s] taken a million of equity out at 3% and
[2788.64s] they can book a Mill and then buy a
[2790.52s] townhouse for a mill cash or or or or
[2795.2s] Finance one at five and change and uh
[2798.68s] and uh invest the the mill of profits uh
[2802.48s] and live happily ever after
[2805.0s] so the thing where I think they&#39;re going
[2807.44s] to get hurt that most of them don&#39;t
[2809.28s] realize is that as rates go down I think
[2814.24s] there&#39;s going to be a mad rush of supply
[2817.119s] pushed on the market massive amount of
[2820.92s] supply and for those who think well my
[2823.8s] my price is going to go even higher as
[2826.72s] rates go down because it trades like a
[2828.64s] bond I think they&#39;re going to be uh
[2831.68s] surprised that
[2834.64s] um uh they&#39;re going to have an enormous
[2837.48s] amount of competition with so many
[2839.0s] houses coming on all at once us pending
[2841.88s] home which is good for the people trying
[2843.4s] to buy houses us pending home sales
[2845.24s] tumbled a record low in July that&#39;s
[2846.96s] going to change very quickly Japanese
[2849.839s] CPI going back up which means boj going
[2853.96s] to be hiking which means Yen going
[2858.04s] higher Juan going higher dollar going
[2861.68s] lower Japanese equities probably going
[2867.599s] lower Chinese Yuan strongest against the
[2870.96s] dollar since the beginning of the year
[2872.92s] moving in the right direction this is
[2874.72s] what we see when Chinese equities start
[2876.64s] going going up Chinese exports up
[2880.559s] 2.6% since October
[2883.839s] 2023 where it&#39;s going to the rest of the
[2887.52s] world they are much lower to the us but
[2893.24s] they are holding steady to the rest of
[2896.52s] the world so the rest of the world
[2900.119s] benefits from their sweat shops while we
[2902.839s] are not benefiting as much um that&#39;s a
[2907.44s] little bit of an exaggeration but I also
[2909.28s] think that&#39;s probably related to believe
[2911.64s] it or not automobiles we&#39;re not allowing
[2914.559s] Chinese cars in the US anytime soon uh
[2918.52s] so um and you know Germany&#39;s shutting
[2921.92s] down factories because they&#39;re letting
[2923.24s] the Chinese cars in so we&#39;ll see what
[2925.359s] happens there I think they&#39;re going to
[2926.64s] be a lot more tariffs coming to a
[2928.24s] theater nearu against the Chinese cars
[2931.72s] uh economic grievances fuel protests in
[2935.24s] China this is what we need to see to
[2937.88s] cause a bazooka type stimulus and we&#39;re
[2940.799s] going to talk we&#39;re going to show you
[2942.079s] some of the things they&#39;ve been doing in
[2943.28s] the last week top 10 cities for economic
[2946.4s] Pro protest shenzen leading the way uh
[2950.24s] and uh you can go down the list here
[2952.76s] protest linked to China&#39;s former real
[2954.92s] estate Giants Country Garden everr Etc
[2958.16s] the natives are getting
[2959.64s] restless uh moving on private clients
[2962.68s] bought Reit financials MLPs so opinion
[2966.72s] follows Trend they&#39;re dumping out of CH
[2968.72s] uh Japan rather not China there&#39;s no one
[2972.0s] left to sell
[2974.0s] China they&#39;re getting out of Japan
[2977.28s] buying financials what were we doing
[2979.359s] selling financials to you and uh fed
[2982.92s] easing history and SNP price return so
[2986.92s] everyone says that
[2991.24s] the um when the fed eases you get a
[2996.079s] recession that is not the case you did
[2998.079s] not get one the three times in 1980s 80
[3002.4s] looks like 83 85 887 Market went up uh
[3007.28s] same thing with the midcycle cuts in
[3009.799s] 9598 same thing and I think we&#39;re going
[3012.48s] to be mid cycle here the probably the
[3014.76s] closest thing to this would be 80 to 83
[3019.48s] we got the recession like in 2020 and
[3022.52s] 2022 and then the second one 83 easing
[3026.319s] Cy
[3027.599s] uh paves away for bull market and good
[3029.28s] things to come fed easing history and
[3031.72s] 10-year note yield well while equities
[3034.76s] go up and midcycle cuts bond yields go
[3039.68s] down every single time so we like that
[3043.44s] that&#39;s part of our core thesis treasury
[3046.68s] yields stay down dollar goes down
[3049.4s] Emerging Markets go up dividend pairs go
[3052.079s] up small caps go up value goes up mag 7
[3056.64s] moderates we&#39;ve already started seeing
[3058.64s] that us real consumer spending Trends
[3062.04s] continue to go up services Goods durable
[3066.119s] goods are rocking and rolling again
[3068.64s] after a huge trough they had the huge
[3071.359s] Peak off the uh covid lows then they
[3073.92s] trough for multiple years and now
[3075.359s] they&#39;re picking back up cars uh washing
[3078.88s] machines you know we got we keep keeping
[3081.079s] an eye on Whirlpool that&#39;s one in our
[3083.64s] sites um that&#39;ll be a function of the
[3087.0s] housing recovery and you know we&#39;re kind
[3089.079s] of levered to that with j and Stanley
[3092.16s] Black and&amp; Decker
[3095.92s] anyway uh fed favored inflation although
[3099.72s] gener 200 maybe we anyway fed favored
[3103.559s] inflation gauges mild gain set stage for
[3106.599s] rate cut and okay consumer inflation
[3110.64s] expectations are at multi-year lows both
[3113.079s] on
[3115.0s] the uh
[3118.24s] uh oneyear expectations below three at
[3122.359s] 2.8 5year inflation expectations at
[3125.52s] three City economic surprise index in
[3128.2s] the Euro zone is turning back up that
[3130.44s] favors International stocks even the
[3133.52s] China Kon manufacturing PMI finally
[3136.839s] turned up above 50 expansion
[3140.079s] level um forward PE ratios of msci China
[3145.0s] index Tech sector is back to like 12
[3148.839s] times all other sectors are trading at
[3151.2s] like seven times this is an historic
[3154.52s] aberration which is going to mean revert
[3157.799s] uh GFC pushed stock allocations below
[3160.48s] the traditional 60 to 65% banned that&#39;s
[3164.079s] very interesting so everyone&#39;s saying oh
[3166.0s] stock allocations are so high because
[3167.799s] they keep looking at from like the last
[3171.24s] 10 years where being above 55 looks like
[3175.559s] you&#39;re too over weight equities but from
[3177.72s] an historical standpoint we&#39;re still
[3179.76s] dramatically below uh the mean which is
[3184.079s] 60% and uh the peak which was in you
[3187.28s] know
[3188.16s] 2022 of
[3190.48s] 71% so there&#39;s a lot more to lever up
[3193.319s] and the other thing when you look at
[3194.68s] household balance sheets we haven&#39;t even
[3197.92s] started the Rel leveraging cycle that
[3201.599s] has been delevering since 2007 2008
[3205.96s] collapse ing uh there is like trillions
[3210.04s] and trillions of dollars of Rel leverage
[3212.839s] availability coming to a theater near
[3215.16s] you and Americans will figure out a way
[3217.64s] to tap that as long as rates go down 100
[3221.92s] 150 basis points which uh which will be
[3225.0s] plenty to get them back out there
[3227.48s] revering
[3231.16s] um mag 7 still owned by 70% or more of
[3235.76s] funds that bank of America tracks They
[3237.96s] are feeling some serious pain in the
[3239.92s] last two months like meaningful pain uh
[3243.72s] mag 7 earnings decelerating other 493
[3247.96s] accelerating by the way you may want to
[3251.44s] go back to that article that I wrote
[3257.24s] in on June 20th you can just go to
[3261.319s] commentary and uh pull up the one that
[3264.28s] has
[3266.559s] Jensen
[3268.4s] Wong signing there you go the next pain
[3272.28s] trade and we talked about Nvidia and we
[3274.68s] talked about the mag 7 we&#39;re going to
[3276.92s] roll over when they&#39;re trading at
[3278.319s] all-time highs and that&#39;s what&#39;s taking
[3281.2s] taking place um and uh and I think more
[3285.319s] of that to come because if you look
[3287.079s] again here to remind you mag 7 earnings
[3290.48s] decelerating other 493 accelerating here
[3293.48s] is the data in I would say black and
[3295.799s] white but it&#39;s light blue and dark blue
[3298.0s] royal blue and aqua blue and you can see
[3301.52s] here the unmagnify have been flat to
[3305.04s] negative for over a year and they just
[3309.04s] inflected positive and they&#39;re re
[3310.88s] accelerating for the next 5 six quarters
[3313.839s] and Beyond while the mag 7 peaked all
[3317.96s] the way in
[3319.68s] 2021 declined we got that Tech recession
[3322.64s] in
[3323.319s] 2022 then they re accelerated uh last
[3326.48s] year to early this year and now they&#39;re
[3327.92s] going to decline from 50% down to
[3331.799s] 18% and maybe a little lower if they
[3334.119s] keep um uh spending all this money on uh
[3337.72s] AI chips that can&#39;t produce anywhere in
[3339.92s] line with the revenues required to make
[3342.48s] them have any positive return on
[3344.72s] investment which means they&#39;re having a
[3346.799s] negative return on Capital which uh is
[3350.48s] what&#39;s crushing margins which is what&#39;s
[3352.16s] causing their earnings to go down which
[3353.799s] is what&#39;s going to cause their stock
[3355.24s] prices to go down in in the near term uh
[3358.119s] which they already have breath is
[3359.839s] widening we saw that
[3362.16s] earlier magnificent 7 have
[3365.079s] underperformed the other 493 by 14 full
[3369.559s] percentage points since mid July okay go
[3373.16s] back to the next pain trade article when
[3376.2s] we talked about that hedge funds
[3378.2s] exposure to cyclicals versus defensive
[3380.559s] sectors is just off an all-time low this
[3383.839s] trade is reaccelerating
[3386.599s] this is just starting I love these
[3389.359s] extremes and the thing about extremes
[3391.4s] whether it&#39;s you know uh you know buying
[3395.839s] look this was an extreme buying Google
[3398.4s] down in October of 2023 when it was down
[3402.64s] 50% and uh March of I&#39;m sorry October
[3406.039s] 2022 and March 2023 look you know you
[3409.319s] could have bought it at 100 and it
[3411.68s] dropped another 20% to 80 you could buy
[3414.319s] Advanced Auto Parts at 50 or 60 it drops
[3416.68s] another 20% to 40 before you put in this
[3420.24s] base which takes you know in this case
[3421.88s] it took 6 months and then it was an easy
[3425.2s] double plus uh over the next year and a
[3428.119s] half and it&#39;s just over and over City
[3431.76s] you could buy at 42 it dropped down to
[3434.559s] 36 another 20% against you and then boom
[3438.52s] double off the lows so this stuff
[3441.2s] happens over and over Amazon same thing
[3443.76s] you could bought it at 90 or 100 it
[3447.039s] dropped to 80 20% against you all of a
[3449.799s] sudden back to 200 so you just have to
[3452.599s] have patience with this stuff if you
[3454.44s] know what you own and you buy good
[3456.559s] assets at good prices good things happen
[3459.4s] over time that&#39;s why you just take very
[3461.799s] limited leverage to no leverage and you
[3464.2s] play the time Arbitrage game you don&#39;t
[3466.039s] play the trade these silly little blips
[3468.52s] up and down and get your face ripped off
[3470.76s] you play the I bought a great business
[3472.559s] at a good price now I just wait for it
[3474.359s] to recover and sure enough when you do
[3476.88s] that framework over and over it works
[3479.039s] some of them just take a year some of
[3480.96s] them take three years some take longer
[3483.359s] but the framework works over and over I
[3485.88s] mean 3M felt like it was going to take
[3487.52s] forever and then when it happens it
[3489.039s] happens all at once this is what I think
[3491.72s] we&#39;re going to see in Alibaba I don&#39;t
[3493.599s] know when I think it&#39;s sooner than we
[3495.48s] all think but you know this thing took a
[3497.76s] year and a half year to build a base and
[3500.28s] then it happens all at once and I think
[3502.28s] the upside magnitude is going to be
[3504.0s] greater and by the way I don&#39;t know that
[3505.4s] 3M is over but you got to book some
[3508.0s] profits and then you know 3M drops back
[3510.16s] down to 100 we&#39;ll take another look at
[3512.52s] it but in the meantime we hold svent
[3514.4s] them free of charge thank you very much
[3517.76s] um last three months biotech saw the
[3520.0s] largest increase in relative relative
[3521.92s] weight we love that we still own our xbi
[3525.319s] there&#39;s another one by the way that&#39;s
[3527.2s] taken a long time okay
[3530.96s] xbi all right take a look at this thing
[3534.319s] this took
[3537.039s] this one is the one that takes longer
[3538.88s] and it by the way it&#39;s been trading kind
[3540.88s] of like the Chinese equities because of
[3542.48s] their interest rate sensitive what&#39;s
[3545.079s] starting in the next two weeks interest
[3548.039s] rates are going down what&#39;s going to go
[3550.4s] up China and biotech this looks like the
[3555.319s] Baba chart okay so let&#39;s just pull it
[3559.319s] up this looks exactly like the Boba
[3563.28s] chart okay so you have
[3571.72s] update come on
[3578.2s] baby yeah so this is wild so you have
[3583.039s] this collapse from
[3585.119s] $320 down to
[3587.359s] $70 and then um you get this rebound to
[3591.52s] 123 then it falls to
[3593.96s] $56 then it doubles to 2018 and it
[3597.44s] basically does nothing for a year and a
[3599.72s] half it&#39;s around $80 right look at xbi
[3603.359s] this is biotch collaps from
[3606.24s] 174 down to
[3608.559s] 61 uh then you get this rally then it
[3611.52s] grinds sideways and then you get what
[3613.839s] you get this big retest down like we got
[3617.0s] earlier this year uh and then boom a
[3620.96s] rally from 60 to 100 and now it&#39;s just
[3623.599s] starting to break out and recover that&#39;s
[3625.44s] the bio Tech and the same thing will
[3629.24s] start to happen just starting to recover
[3631.16s] here we&#39;re going to see this thing break
[3632.559s] over 90 and then We&#39;re Off to the Races
[3635.839s] uh and um and it&#39;s going to be exciting
[3637.96s] because it&#39;s going to be so hated all
[3640.359s] the way up I mean you&#39;re going to just
[3642.079s] have people criticizing and then I&#39;m
[3643.64s] telling you uh I Remember by the way in
[3648.16s] June um there were big Talking Heads
[3651.92s] getting super excited about Amazon at
[3656.64s] $200 because it had just broken out okay
[3660.52s] or I think it was 190 it just broken out
[3663.039s] they said I&#39;m buying the breakout and
[3665.079s] that&#39;s when we were just laying the
[3666.88s] off left and right uh the majority of
[3670.0s] the position and sold the rest of the
[3671.48s] position down here at 180 and change
[3673.96s] this week
[3677.079s] uh and um and you&#39;re going to see that
[3680.319s] with Alibaba when there&#39;s a two- handle
[3682.68s] on it you&#39;re all the people that hate it
[3684.599s] are going to be pounding the table on it
[3687.079s] uh and it&#39;s going to be fun and we&#39;re
[3688.64s] going to start laying off in the mid2
[3690.799s] 200s and hopefully uh some a lot
[3694.44s] higher moving on
[3698.24s] um boy we&#39;ve got a lot of great stuff
[3702.039s] this week uh hedge funds exposure to
[3704.44s] utilities is elevated versus history
[3706.48s] when we were pounding the table on
[3707.88s] utilities no one wanted them now what&#39;s
[3710.44s] happened after they&#39;re up
[3713.0s] 50% everyone wants them they can&#39;t get
[3715.48s] enough it&#39;s it&#39;s just over that&#39;s not it
[3723.119s] xlu okay no one wanted them last fall at
[3726.359s] 50 bucks now at 75 bucks they can&#39;t get
[3729.319s] enough uh I&#39;m not saying it&#39;s over I&#39;m
[3731.88s] just saying that there are times to buy
[3735.64s] and um and and and to outperform over
[3738.799s] time you have to buy when no one else
[3740.839s] wants it um private sector jobs at
[3744.559s] recessionary levels and credit need
[3747.24s] fresh hiring private X payrolls X
[3749.119s] Education Health contributions total
[3751.76s] payroll um all right so that&#39;s that bull
[3755.559s] and be indicator is not yet at an
[3757.119s] extreme that&#39;s why I think we&#39;re going
[3758.44s] to get some strength into that first cut
[3760.319s] we&#39;ll see uh secular bull Mark in in
[3763.72s] Commodities is just getting started we
[3765.88s] agree and we think this is set up to uh
[3769.16s] very similarly to that 2000 period 2000
[3772.2s] to 2007 that&#39;s when emerging markets do
[3775.16s] exceptionally well well when Commodities
[3776.88s] take off this is fantastic this chart
[3780.319s] here Tech Telecom Healthcare versus
[3783.44s] Financial energy materials so basically
[3785.96s] growth versus value you can see and
[3788.799s] people forget these are normal regular
[3792.359s] Cycles you&#39;re just blinded by recency
[3795.52s] bias of the last handful of years when
[3798.079s] it looked like the only thing that could
[3799.64s] work is Tech Telecom Healthcare but if
[3802.64s] you look back um from two 2000 to
[3807.72s] 2007 it only looked like financials
[3810.96s] energies and materials could work while
[3813.64s] Microsoft was in the gutter and Cisco
[3816.0s] was in the gutter and Intel all the
[3818.24s] Darlings Amazon all the Darlings were of
[3821.599s] the of the &#39;90s tech boom were in the
[3825.24s] gutter and value was going like crazy
[3827.44s] Emerging Markets we&#39;re right at the same
[3829.799s] level and and what does that mean uh is
[3833.4s] the waiting of tech Telecom and health
[3835.839s] cares 44% it hit that high at the peak
[3839.799s] in 2000 here we are back at the peak in
[3843.559s] 2024 and what were the low levels and
[3847.44s] the peak levels for financials energy
[3850.039s] materials the lows were 24 in 2000
[3853.279s] before it got up to 44% the same level
[3856.319s] the magic 44 doesn&#39;t mean this doesn&#39;t
[3858.72s] go to 50 and this doesn&#39;t go to 20
[3861.0s] before you get the turnaround but these
[3862.92s] Cycles happen over and over again and
[3864.88s] when I&#39;ve been pounding the table is
[3867.039s] starting to be substantiated by earnings
[3869.24s] power now and soon we will see flows
[3872.319s] with the FED changing the regime new
[3874.52s] orders and inventory suggest ism is back
[3877.119s] at 52 by October so new orders and
[3881.24s] inventories restock cycle is picked back
[3884.72s] up um people are flying into re out of
[3887.839s] Japan we covered that the bullish
[3890.119s] indicator is not yet at extreme this is
[3892.52s] from slomer uh markets and S&amp;P Cycles
[3895.96s] what does best at the beginning of a new
[3898.88s] cycle bottoming in early uptrends China
[3902.72s] Canadian dollar energy transports small
[3907.119s] caps Emerging Markets this is where the
[3910.4s] big money will be in the next 24 months
[3913.16s] ladies and gentlemen and and what&#39;s
[3915.96s] finishing up their outperformance is the
[3918.88s] tech is winding down as these things are
[3921.64s] ramping up over and over what else
[3924.279s] happens in Industry Group
[3926.72s] Autos energy Pharma you know start
[3930.0s] looking at fizer some of these left for
[3932.039s] dead Pharma companies uh food and
[3934.76s] tobacco the horels of the world so
[3937.839s] anyway pretty exciting now this chart I
[3942.16s] mean I&#39;m so excited about this stuff and
[3944.76s] uh this chart shows how history repeats
[3949.279s] itself when one company gets too
[3951.96s] concentrated in the index how it doesn&#39;t
[3954.68s] last never has has never will General
[3957.799s] Motors was
[3959.16s] 10% uh all the way back in
[3962.96s] 1968 and it collapsed down to
[3965.48s] 0% uh IBM same thing got up to 3% of the
[3970.52s] total market cap of all stocks collapsed
[3973.64s] down to less than a half a percent
[3975.72s] Altria got up to 2 and a half% in 1993
[3979.44s] collapsed down to less than a half a
[3981.319s] percent Cisco got up to
[3983.96s] 4% of total total market cap of of all
[3989.0s] US stocks and and then collapsed down to
[3992.079s] less than half a percent General
[3993.559s] Electric hit that magic 4% in 2000
[3997.039s] collapsed down to nothing Exxon hit that
[3999.44s] magic 4% uh 4 a half% in uh
[4005.4s] 2009 collapsed all the way down Apple
[4008.88s] just hit 75% is rolling over Microsoft
[4013.799s] 7% we&#39;ll see Nvidia 6% starting to
[4018.559s] weaken so
[4021.4s] history Rhymes pay attention to the
[4024.72s] lyrics ladies and gentlemen uh Hong Kong
[4027.599s] retail sales volume index
[4029.72s] turning uh so this shows the normal
[4032.359s] sequence so everyone&#39;s saying oh it&#39;s
[4033.799s] weak it&#39;s weak it&#39;s always weak in the
[4035.359s] summer and then it turns back up every
[4038.079s] single year so the back half going to
[4039.92s] start to see this e-commerce kick up
[4042.52s] retail sales kick up and people are
[4044.279s] going to say what happened oh the
[4045.559s] economy turning well there&#39;s some
[4046.76s] seasonality around it as well household
[4050.0s] debt to disposable income we&#39;ve been
[4052.68s] covering this look how deleveraged total
[4056.599s] debt service ratio it&#39;s it&#39;s at historic
[4060.96s] lows okay it peaked in 2008 it&#39;s
[4064.799s] collapsed they can relever up all of
[4068.039s] this percentage and and the economy can
[4070.44s] Boom for the next 8 to 10 years and uh
[4074.079s] that&#39;s the base case as the young people
[4075.92s] take out mortgages to uh start families
[4078.799s] Etc median path of the S&amp;P 1984 to 2023
[4083.76s] again more seasonality shows a little
[4086.4s] rally mid-september collapse and then
[4089.2s] endof year Rally from late October
[4092.079s] office vacancy rate is a record
[4094.64s] high this is changing in some areas I
[4097.799s] continue to say there are going to be
[4100.239s] some super wealthy clients of mine that
[4102.199s] listen to this every week that are going
[4104.159s] to figure out when and how to hold some
[4107.12s] of these higher class Office Buildings
[4110.56s] not buying the marginal stuff the BNC
[4113.52s] like the malls they&#39;re still vacant But
[4115.56s] the A and the B+ stuff that have 20%
[4118.64s] vacancy rates right now I&#39;m telling you
[4120.719s] when the unemployment rate goes up to 4
[4122.719s] and a half 5% everyone is going to
[4125.759s] Scurry back to work and want FaceTime
[4127.759s] with their boss and these vacancy rates
[4130.44s] are going to go probably to 15% or 10%
[4134.359s] and if you bought some of these
[4136.12s] properties uh you&#39;re going to make
[4137.719s] double your money I mean it&#39;s going to
[4139.56s] be unreal and then because you&#39;re in
[4142.199s] real estate you don&#39;t pay any taxes and
[4144.159s] you&#39;re can do a 1035 Exchange and you&#39;re
[4146.08s] going to pull out you know a few hundred
[4148.12s] million out of it and uh and hopefully
[4151.56s] when you make your half a billion on
[4153.64s] your next office uh uh uh properties you
[4157.279s] know don&#39;t forget me send me send me 20
[4160.359s] 30 okay you know let you diversify some
[4163.04s] of that risk after you do your office
[4164.719s] trade all right China valued at just 40%
[4167.679s] of us markets this is like this is the
[4171.239s] kind of stuff where dreams are made of
[4172.839s] ladies and gentlemen when you can buy
[4175.159s] the mean two standard deviations out and
[4179.159s] even if it doesn&#39;t even get back to the
[4181.08s] mean you double and triple your money
[4183.0s] and that&#39;s where we are with China right
[4184.92s] now uh if it takes another six months
[4188.04s] God bless I could care less uh if it
[4190.679s] happens in 6 weeks that would be even
[4192.88s] better maybe I&#39;ll buy some Office
[4194.36s] Buildings with my friend who actually
[4195.96s] know what they&#39;re doing um anyway Costco
[4200.0s] again
[4201.08s] showing the
[4203.11s] [Music]
[4204.28s] um uh Costco is showing oh by the way
[4207.36s] welcome to Jeff a who&#39;s just texting me
[4211.239s] uh Jeff a and Stephen F who have just
[4213.84s] joined the team doing a great job on
[4215.88s] their respective roles um super excited
[4219.08s] to have them on board Costco these same
[4222.96s] tourist comp sales are off the the
[4225.48s] charts fantastic the total companies&#39;s
[4228.36s] 5% year onye uh e-commerce is up 22% so
[4232.84s] the consumer is not totally Dead uh this
[4235.12s] is from Mike zardi Global EPS estimates
[4238.04s] are ticking decidedly higher even China
[4242.08s] exclamation point and China is trading
[4244.48s] at just nine times earnings which is the
[4247.32s] name of the game Chinese estimates
[4249.36s] picking up not down
[4252.52s] up capex from all major hyperscale
[4256.44s] 191 billion so far this is why their
[4259.64s] margins are going down their spending is
[4262.8s] going up dramatically faster than their
[4265.0s] revenues declining margins they they
[4268.159s] need 600 billion of new Revenue to
[4271.719s] justify the amount of money they&#39;ve
[4273.159s] spent already never mind what they&#39;re
[4275.04s] going to spend this is like Global
[4277.36s] Crossing laying all those pipes in the
[4279.88s] late
[4281.199s] 1990s eventually those pipes came to use
[4284.239s] but by then Global Crossing was toast
[4288.44s] labor force growth native and
[4290.719s] immigration
[4292.159s] contribution uh basically foreign born
[4296.0s] immigration is having the biggest
[4298.32s] contribution to job growth earnings
[4301.76s] growth here is again I keep emphasizing
[4305.0s] because this theme will make you the
[4307.04s] most money in the next couple of years
[4309.96s] mag 7 growth went from 50% to 35% to 18%
[4314.84s] next quarter to 19% what happened with
[4317.84s] UNM magificent
[4319.199s] 493 -2 to 6 next quarter will be+ 1 then
[4323.679s] plus 15% in the fourth quarter and uh
[4328.28s] and more next year PE ratio of the top
[4331.679s] 10 and remaining stocks in the S&amp;P 500
[4334.719s] so if you back out the mag 7 which are
[4336.76s] going to come down or underperform the
[4339.719s] rest of the market is relatively cheap
[4342.44s] 18.4 times with 15% earnings growth is
[4346.32s] bar you know 1 two times Peg price price
[4351.52s] to earnings growth is pretty good
[4353.88s] pickings weight of the top 10 stocks in
[4356.28s] the S&amp;P 500 36% again mean reversion
[4360.36s] earnings contribution of the top 10 in
[4362.36s] the S&amp;P 500 is only 28% so they&#39;ve got
[4367.32s] 36% call it of the waiting at the peak
[4370.76s] with only 28% of the earnings growth and
[4374.8s] his historically what you see is that
[4378.56s] mean reverts very very quickly value
[4381.0s] versus growth in different interest rate
[4382.6s] environments what does value outperform
[4386.0s] best in it outperforms growth in
[4389.04s] environments between 4 to 5% and greater
[4393.04s] than 5% so that&#39;s why we could see a
[4397.12s] situation where we only go 125 to 150
[4401.4s] for the whole cycle and that&#39;s an
[4403.76s] environment for like 2021 to 2027 value
[4408.08s] out performed dramatically for five six
[4410.84s] seven years along with Emerging Markets
[4413.88s] which in my book is value on any metric
[4416.719s] and um dividend payers and small caps
[4419.92s] median path of the S&amp;P around an
[4422.639s] uninversity
[4435.159s] % GDP growth uh this is the path which
[4438.719s] is upward why everyone worries is
[4441.44s] because often that happens and causes a
[4444.56s] recession uh I think this time has
[4447.199s] proven well one we already had the
[4449.4s] recession that everyone&#39;s waiting for in
[4450.88s] 20122 they just didn&#39;t declare it
[4452.76s] despite two quarters of negative GDP
[4454.84s] growth which we&#39;ve covered at infinitum
[4457.36s] on this podcast uh technology jobs are
[4460.719s] where all the cuts are happening you&#39;re
[4462.159s] seeing it already 40,000 some OD Cuts
[4464.639s] since July uh that&#39;s going to continue
[4468.56s] us equities versus Commodities at 2 and
[4470.92s] 1/2 year High We Believe Commodities are
[4474.44s] just reaccelerating there&#39;s going to be
[4476.84s] huge opportunities right now we&#39;re
[4478.639s] expressed through
[4482.92s] um comto which we love we have albamar
[4487.639s] which is a smaller newer
[4489.719s] position uh we haven&#39;t leaned into yet
[4492.6s] but we&#39;re actively looking for more
[4495.8s] opportunity to get
[4499.04s] exposure uh seasonality of since 1976
[4503.84s] Presidential year we covered this again
[4506.0s] rally into midt rollover after secular
[4509.84s] bull market in Commodities just
[4511.08s] beginning we&#39;re covered that GDP growth
[4514.56s] boost due to AI will boost oil Demand by
[4519.56s] 200,000 barrels per day in 5 years
[4522.639s] 700,000 barrels per day in 10 years we
[4527.0s] are in the middle of a rough patch this
[4529.639s] is from Dietrich over at Carson but the
[4533.199s] rough patch doesn&#39;t begin until the 17th
[4536.639s] it shows the average return per day from
[4539.239s] 1950 to 2023 as you can see all the red
[4543.0s] comes from the 18th to the 30th of
[4545.12s] September all the green is beforehand
[4548.239s] with a little bit of spottiness early in
[4550.36s] the month which we saw this week so
[4554.56s] that&#39;s data like there&#39;s nobody&#39;s
[4557.719s] business uh moving on to the quote of
[4560.0s] the weeks you from Buffett you can&#39;t
[4562.679s] reach success in investment if you do
[4564.6s] not think independently uh you know
[4567.4s] people could fault me for a lot of
[4568.719s] things but no one will ever accuse me of
[4570.44s] not thinking independently that I can
[4572.36s] damn assure you uh there&#39;s no uh her
[4576.44s] following uh here that&#39;s for sure
[4579.159s] Charlie Munger a lot of people with high
[4581.04s] IQs are terrible investors because
[4583.12s] they&#39;ve got terrible temp forments and
[4585.88s] by the way not just highq but super
[4588.56s] successful entrepreneurs who get paid
[4592.08s] for Massive Action yielding massive
[4594.639s] results and in our business we have to
[4597.04s] have the discipline to take inaction
[4599.6s] massive inaction gets the best results
[4601.92s] when you&#39;ve done your work you just sit
[4603.6s] on your butt and wait and don&#39;t get
[4605.32s] faked out like everyone trading the
[4607.48s] short-term noise China&#39;s internet users
[4610.159s] near 1.1 billion that is still a growing
[4613.12s] Market driven by short videos mobile
[4615.08s] payments alibaba&#39;s participating on both
[4617.76s] fronts Alibaba wins beijing&#39;s approval
[4620.76s] ending years long scrutiny so what began
[4625.04s] with this antitrust Watchdog in 2021
[4627.96s] which caused the stock to collapse from
[4629.44s] 320 down to
[4631.52s] 56 uh is now officially over this was
[4634.679s] announced on Friday uh uh August
[4639.96s] 30th
[4642.48s] and Baba secured the Endor M of China&#39;s
[4645.84s] Anti-Trust Watchdog more than 3 years
[4647.96s] after a landmark probe into its online
[4650.04s] Behavior suggesting Beijing is Keen to
[4652.679s] Signal its support for the country&#39;s
[4655.639s] giant internet sector amen hallelujah
[4660.0s] Alibaba shares rise after it completes
[4662.12s] threeyear regulatory
[4664.76s] overhaul
[4673.08s] uh Alibaba is completely stopped the
[4675.84s] quote choose one of two Monopoly
[4678.12s] Behavior the SM samr said uh completed
[4682.52s] the rectification process that started
[4685.32s] in 2021 China&#39;s Market regulator said on
[4688.28s] Friday it&#39;s an interesting timing
[4692.719s] considering they&#39;re in the market buying
[4694.84s] bonds I and they&#39;re in the market buying
[4697.56s] equities it wouldn&#39;t surprise me if I&#39;m
[4701.08s] the government I want to use the
[4703.12s] southbound connect opportunity
[4705.6s] When Baba starts to move to juice that
[4707.679s] stock if they juice the the alab Baba
[4710.36s] stock the entire world will start to
[4713.08s] flow back into China uh and all they
[4715.52s] have to do is move one stock and it&#39;s
[4717.6s] not even moving it it&#39;s you know it&#39;s
[4719.639s] funny someone said to me like oh
[4723.36s] um see people think that alibaba&#39;s
[4727.159s] business has to double from here for the
[4729.52s] stock to double from here and that
[4731.239s] couldn&#39;t be further from the truth the
[4733.44s] business is actually grown since the
[4736.36s] stock has been $300 what you had was
[4739.639s] multiple like unprecedented multiple
[4743.239s] contraction because of government
[4745.0s] interference once in a 100y Year events
[4747.679s] you name it all the that we
[4749.36s] know about is now over so what&#39;s going
[4752.12s] to happen as earnings go up is all of
[4756.239s] these higher quality Chinese companies
[4758.84s] are going to start to get multiple
[4761.12s] doesn&#39;t we don&#39;t even have to say
[4762.48s] multiple expansion multiple
[4765.92s] normalization would be a double alone
[4768.679s] with no improvement in business
[4770.8s] performance and then uh markets uh
[4775.239s] overshoot on both sides despondency on
[4777.44s] the downside Euphoria so you&#39;re not
[4778.92s] going to get a reversion to the mean
[4780.44s] you&#39;re going to get a reversion well
[4781.6s] above the mean and at the same time the
[4783.96s] business is going to continue to improve
[4786.8s] they stop they stop P pinu Duo dead in
[4789.719s] their tracks we saw in the last two
[4791.159s] quarters if you read both transcripts
[4792.719s] you&#39;re going to realize uh they&#39;re
[4794.719s] competition picked up from Alibaba
[4796.36s] Alibaba fell asleep at the wheel and
[4798.719s] they walk up right before they drove the
[4800.36s] car over the bridge and they said no MOS
[4802.8s] and they went brutal guns blazing at
[4805.679s] pindu Duo and pushed them back and now
[4808.92s] they&#39;re back on a run and the game is
[4811.28s] back on so uh then you get the Tailwind
[4813.679s] of the economy then you get the
[4814.76s] government you know uh starting to move
[4817.159s] on policy because protests are happening
[4819.6s] etc etc and we&#39;re We&#39;re Off to the Races
[4822.159s] but this is a huge message at an
[4824.12s] interesting time with the southbound
[4826.4s] connect expected to go live as soon as
[4828.719s] next week which means both the company
[4831.239s] will be able to buy back shares without
[4832.84s] issuing convert because they can buy it
[4835.199s] uh with their local currency uh the
[4838.36s] Chinese government would have an easier
[4840.0s] time buying it and uh and 180 to 220
[4843.6s] million new retail investors who have
[4845.6s] not been able to buy the Amazon of their
[4847.4s] own country for 10 years will now be
[4849.88s] able to Own It For the First Time their
[4851.719s] National Champion Ali Baba only one
[4855.12s] National Champion ladies and gentlemen
[4857.12s] Chinese e-commerce giant pindu Duo
[4860.159s] updates rules to kick out sellers of
[4862.719s] shotty products this is hysterical which
[4865.48s] basically means they will have no more
[4867.92s] sellers I mean you can&#39;t make this stuff
[4870.32s] off uh China is trading its own bonds to
[4873.639s] stifle a runaway Bond rally yields are
[4875.679s] going to start going up that we talked
[4877.28s] about that Yuan goes up yields go up
[4879.48s] stocks go up uh Yen goes up China stocks
[4883.4s] listed in Us near cheapest levels ever
[4886.679s] versus NASDAQ peers uh Golden Dragon
[4890.159s] index valued at record discount to
[4892.239s] NASDAQ 100 this always mean reverts the
[4895.88s] last time it got this low was
[4898.0s] 2014 and not only did it mean revert it
[4901.6s] overshot then the same thing in 2008
[4904.719s] 2009 not only did it mean revert it
[4907.92s] overshoots this is the PE spread last
[4910.48s] time it was this close was again 2014
[4913.52s] 2015 and then back in
[4916.199s] 2006 uh Etc so pretty exciting stuff
[4919.88s] there Biden uh okay so Intel when&#39;s the
[4923.92s] next Catalyst number one I think we&#39;re
[4925.679s] going to wake up one morning and someone
[4927.32s] like Elliott or some other major
[4930.04s] activist is going to be in the stock why
[4932.92s] because if they liquidate the whole
[4935.0s] company they get their money back if
[4937.12s] they follow through on the plan and
[4939.12s] create value they get double or triple
[4941.639s] their money back so all they have to do
[4943.36s] is shake a few trees and the stock will
[4945.28s] go up so this is a no-brainer for an
[4947.199s] activist but the board is having a
[4951.36s] meeting midt according to people
[4954.12s] familiar with the matter this is in
[4955.88s] Bloomberg
[4957.44s] um and
[4959.8s] um so we&#39;ll get stuff like maybe not
[4963.0s] doing the German
[4964.44s] Factory um selling off some of these
[4967.28s] non-core uh assets like Mobil ey and uh
[4971.48s] there was a a couple other non-core that
[4973.4s] they talked about uh and really the plan
[4975.56s] forward and then whether G singer&#39;s head
[4977.199s] goes on the chopping block or not I
[4979.28s] don&#39;t know that that&#39;s the right move I
[4982.88s] I
[4984.719s] um I mean unless they announce like just
[4987.28s] an unbelievable name but
[4991.4s] um we&#39;ll see but change is coming and
[4994.04s] that&#39;s a good thing especially when you
[4995.239s] have a stock trading a tangible book

[5034.639s] talent and stealing Secrets what did you
[5037.199s] expect them to do with the sanctions
[5040.0s] again just to
[5042.88s] reiterate all we did was take them off
[5046.199s] our tit they were they were dependent on
[5049.08s] us to buy all their chips and we said we
[5052.199s] are not selling you chips anymore in the
[5054.239s] name of National Security and the result
[5056.4s] is now they&#39;re going to poach all the
[5057.88s] talent around the world pay these guys
[5059.96s] four times not only are they going to
[5061.56s] poach Taiwanese they&#39;re going to poach
[5063.12s] Americans and they&#39;re going to get all
[5065.199s] the intellectual property and instead of
[5066.8s] being dependent and giving us all the
[5068.679s] money uh sooner or later we&#39;re going to
[5070.639s] be giving them all the money and that
[5072.6s] was just bad policy uh shortsightedness
[5076.679s] and um you know so for everyone worried
[5078.8s] about them not having the chips for AI
[5080.44s] they already got them Microsoft rolled
[5082.76s] out AI PCS that can&#39;t play Top Games and
[5085.76s] there&#39;s no quick fix it&#39;s the Qualcomm
[5088.52s] arm processor chips what&#39;s their Quick
[5090.76s] Fix notice the the one company that is
[5093.56s] not in this article is Intel who shipped
[5098.0s] 40 million AIP PCS this year the leader
[5102.92s] in aip&#39;s no problemos with intellos
[5107.4s] chios so the moral of the story is they
[5111.0s] do have value and Moes Etc uh here&#39;s
[5115.719s] whether they&#39;re going to get rid of
[5117.199s] gelsinger or not we&#39;ll see uh Intel is
[5120.0s] trading at tangible books says Thomas
[5122.239s] Hayes on Fox Business
[5125.36s] Intel uh more on Intel oh working a
[5128.4s] variety of
[5130.239s] options uh anyways and activist defense
[5133.92s] Yuan hits strongest in over a year as
[5136.56s] flows offset fundamentals that will be
[5139.32s] more the case after the first cut this
[5142.199s] is what we need to see Northface parent
[5145.48s] VF Corp sees big Insider stock by so one
[5151.0s] of the board member you know Bracken
[5153.04s] made a million of purchases we know that
[5155.719s] and former Chief Financial of Yum brands
[5159.719s] who sits on the board bought 350,000 I
[5164.52s] mean this guy it&#39;s not a huge amount of
[5167.0s] money but he&#39;s a CFO of young Brands
[5169.92s] probably worth five or 10 million bucks
[5173.28s] um so it&#39;s not nothing he raised Disney
[5176.88s] park prices and fans still love him now
[5179.28s] he&#39;s on the CE show short list this is
[5181.28s] the next Catalyst for Disney his name is
[5183.84s] Josh dearo diaro he is an experiences
[5188.4s] master and uh one of the two key
[5191.119s] candidates for
[5193.199s] Disney Boeing investors weigh cost of
[5196.48s] strike as clock ticks on contract this
[5198.44s] is part of the reason for some of the
[5200.36s] weight on the stock they do this over
[5203.96s] and over they&#39;ll get it resolved if the
[5206.88s] UAW can resolve with GM and Ford then uh
[5212.679s] Boeing can resolve with their workers as
[5214.84s] well and they will with the new CEO
[5217.56s] biotech stocks are showing signs of Life
[5219.639s] why the rally could continue we covered
[5222.36s] that earlier with the chart great to
[5224.48s] have you back uh Jim Grant The Perennial
[5227.08s] pessimist is now saying 50 basis Cuts is
[5229.76s] more likely now uh if they&#39;re going to
[5233.119s] do 50 my guess it was is it will be on
[5236.56s] the second cut in November versus the
[5238.84s] first cut but we&#39;ll see no one has a
[5241.719s] perfect crystal ball us SA regulator
[5244.88s] calls for probe of teu and shine over
[5248.239s] deadly baby and toddler products I mean
[5251.159s] this thing is a complete disaster and uh
[5254.96s] remember we&#39;ve been saying since day one
[5257.6s] unsustainable numbers or unreliable
[5260.159s] numbers it doesn&#39;t matter the key is
[5262.52s] they&#39;re slowing and declining boj board
[5266.36s] member Tata sees need to shift gears
[5269.04s] which is code for
[5272.56s] uh raise rate
[5274.639s] so as soon as the FED starts cutting boj
[5277.28s] is going to start re unwinding the carry
[5280.56s] trade uh I.E hiking rates I.E unwinding
[5285.76s] the mag s trade where you borrowed for
[5287.76s] nothing and you shorted Yen and you
[5289.719s] bought mag 7 Boeing says China
[5293.44s] commercial air fleet predicted to double
[5295.52s] in the next two decades demand for 8830
[5298.239s] new planes Google is losing market share
[5300.76s] to chat GPT what it means for alphabet
[5303.239s] stock
[5304.719s] um you know better to be lucky than to
[5307.119s] be good uh we sold the majority of the
[5310.0s] position uh after that pain trade
[5312.639s] article in early
[5314.4s] July uh and uh we&#39;ll look to get out of
[5317.88s] the rest it&#39;s not so much I think when
[5320.56s] all is said and done they&#39;re going to do
[5322.639s] great in
[5323.88s] AI uh I think that some point sometimes
[5327.0s] you got to ring the register and we&#39;d
[5328.6s] like to do it and we&#39;d like to
[5331.4s] reinitiate maybe at much lower levels
[5334.159s] and maybe it&#39;ll just keep running away
[5335.719s] from against us and that&#39;s fine too but
[5338.239s] we got plenty of plenty of new ideas so
[5340.96s] uh Boeing speeds 737 deliveries to China
[5344.4s] in respit for new CEO Intel is we
[5348.239s] covered that this is tonight they&#39;re
[5349.44s] selling part of Mobile ey and also um
[5353.119s] their Network and Edge business uh which
[5356.04s] is
[5357.8s] uh where is that
[5367.119s] all right Asos is up 15% today
[5371.56s] um we still haven&#39;t leaned into the
[5374.36s] position but we were really happy to see
[5376.639s] that with our existing position this
[5378.159s] thing starting to move we&#39;ve been
[5379.239s] talking about the turn around in UK
[5381.159s] we&#39;ve played it through a real siiz
[5383.0s] position in gxo logistics which gets 50%
[5386.76s] of their revenues over there uh and Asos
[5390.0s] in a smaller position we are going to
[5392.6s] spend some more time and determine
[5394.48s] whether or not this becomes a serious
[5396.36s] position or just a small position but
[5398.96s] it&#39;s nice to see some life that they got
[5401.52s] from finally selling the top stock sh
[5404.4s] stop Top Shop stake that we&#39;ve been
[5408.239s] talking about and they were supposed to
[5409.679s] do nine months ago they finally did it
[5411.44s] so um that turnaround is in progress
[5414.159s] world&#39;s smallest violin stock market and
[5416.199s] sentiment
[5417.719s] results uh we covered the kellyo Grady
[5420.32s] last week so thanks to Jake Mack Liz
[5422.96s] Clayman and Kell for having me on we
[5425.6s] played that in last week&#39;s podcast cuz
[5427.4s] we had done that on Thursday and then uh
[5430.92s] we we we did all this moving on to
[5433.639s] Boeing
[5435.199s] so these two charts are critical and if
[5438.08s] you&#39;re listening go to hedge fun
[5440.4s] tips.com when while you&#39;re there click
[5443.199s] on terms this is all opinion not advice
[5446.0s] my friend in Dallas got me this
[5448.96s] beautiful cup opinions not advice
[5455.32s] booya hedge fun tips what a thoughtful
[5458.28s] amazing
[5459.36s] gift and then they also got me this when
[5461.639s] I did episode
[5464.239s] 200
[5467.36s] um all right world smallest violin
[5470.52s] so when you look and you find this
[5472.8s] article click on commentary or click on
[5475.159s] most popular post it&#39;s the number one
[5476.8s] most popular post today and probably
[5479.52s] will be tomorrow as
[5481.56s] well so this shows the chart since
[5494.28s] 1974 and you&#39;re looking at uh 50 years
[5498.52s] five decades and what you see is it
[5500.84s] keeps having these Corrections and it
[5503.04s] keeps recovering to new highs and it
[5504.679s] keeps having these Corrections and it
[5505.8s] keeps recovering to new highs it keeps
[5507.239s] having these Corrections keeps
[5508.239s] recovering to new highs keeps having
[5509.52s] these Corrections keeps recovering to
[5511.119s] new highs and this time will be no
[5512.719s] different why because it&#39;s a duopoly and
[5514.92s] people like to fly and they can only get
[5516.639s] their planes from two companies which
[5518.679s] have 99% of the market Bombardier tried
[5522.76s] to do it they got smoked okay the US
[5525.119s] government said you can do it but we&#39;re
[5527.52s] going to charge you 300% tariffs so
[5529.92s] tells you everything you need to know um
[5532.96s] you also see the table and the chart
[5535.639s] above are all you need to know about
[5537.719s] duopolistic Boeing for decades it has
[5540.44s] had periods of negative free cash flow
[5543.32s] followed by free cash flow recoveries
[5546.4s] negative free cash flow free cash flow
[5548.6s] recovery negative free cash flow free
[5551.04s] cash flow recovery negative free cash
[5553.52s] flow free cash flow recovery it has had
[5556.88s] periods of dips in revenues followed by
[5559.6s] recoveries to new highs in revenues
[5562.08s] that&#39;s called a cyclical business not a
[5564.88s] secular grower a cyclical grower here
[5568.199s] you saw in the mid90s a dip in recovery
[5571.76s] followed by a Rec recovery in revenues
[5575.28s] dip in revenues followed by a recovery
[5577.28s] in 2000 dip in revenues 2004 followed by
[5580.92s] a recovery dip in revenues 2008 followed
[5583.48s] by recovery dip in revenues 2011
[5585.76s] followed by recovery dip in revenues in
[5587.84s] a one in 100 Year event in 2021 starting
[5591.0s] to recover and it goes on and on it has
[5594.96s] had periods of dips in stock price
[5597.8s] followed by recoveries to new highs in
[5600.44s] stock price this time will be no
[5604.36s] different okay so you got
[5607.84s] a160 stock that over time will be a
[5613.56s] $436 stock at least and probably higher
[5616.32s] than that we don&#39;t know if that&#39;s in 3
[5618.4s] years we don&#39;t know if that&#39;s in 5 years
[5621.04s] so if it goes to 100 before it goes to
[5624.159s] 400 and you own it at
[5626.239s] $160 is that a life-threatening thing no
[5630.84s] unless you own it on margin and leverage
[5632.56s] or you&#39;re impatient or don&#39;t understand
[5634.56s] what you own uh more likely than not
[5637.679s] maybe it goes to 150 we add a few more
[5639.96s] shares and then it starts to work its
[5641.96s] way towards 300 over the next three plus
[5644.48s] years and we make it double over three
[5646.119s] years which is in line with our uh
[5648.32s] acceptable irr over time and uh and we
[5651.48s] can sleep at well at night putting siiz
[5653.6s] on in a pos position like this because
[5656.159s] now we actually have an engineer running
[5658.08s] the company who created a four bagger
[5660.48s] while he did in six years in Rockwell
[5662.96s] Collins which which is in a similar
[5664.52s] business or an ancillary
[5667.0s] business uh so that&#39;s that Tuesday&#39;s
[5669.76s] downgrade by a short-termist cide
[5672.159s] analyst was comical quote Boeing delays
[5676.32s] its1 billion a year free cash flow
[5679.679s] Target by one year from 2026 to 2027 for
[5684.92s] those slow with math the market cap is
[5687.679s] just a hundred billion dollar right now
[5689.84s] or 10 times two years out free cash flow
[5693.76s] a 10% free cash flow yield here was the
[5696.96s] Reuters article citing one of the most
[5699.159s] ridiculous analyst reports I&#39;ve seen in
[5701.48s] my years in the business annual cash
[5704.159s] flow may be delayed to
[5706.639s] 2027 2028 and it would have to raise $30
[5711.159s] billion before developing a new aircraft
[5714.44s] Wells Fargo said in the downgraded stock
[5717.679s] shares in the Dell component fell 7%
[5720.679s] Boeing carries about 45 billion in net
[5722.76s] debt it must address this before it
[5725.199s] kicks off the next aircraft development
[5727.0s] cycle cutting the debt would consume its
[5729.28s] cash flow through
[5732.92s] 2030 here&#39;s he goes on to say given a
[5735.8s] likely new aircraft launch Boeing will
[5738.04s] need to shore up the balance sheet
[5739.76s] sooner uh said XYZ analyst who is rated
[5743.76s] three out of five stars for estimate
[5747.159s] accuracy on lseg workspace I wouldn&#39;t
[5750.719s] even go to a taco place rated three out
[5752.76s] of five never mind invest based on their
[5757.56s] opinion all right we estimate roughly 30
[5762.119s] billion Equity raise to get back to zero
[5764.679s] net debt by
[5766.04s] 2027 number
[5768.28s] one is Dave Ramsey Boeing&#39;s new
[5771.28s] financial advisor like who the hell said
[5773.44s] anything about net debt getting to zero
[5776.639s] why would you ever do that I mean it you
[5779.36s] can&#39;t even make this stuff up like this
[5781.56s] guy just got out of a Tony Robins
[5783.159s] seminar is walking on coals talking
[5785.0s] about being debt free it doesn&#39;t work
[5787.08s] that way in the real world my man so
[5789.239s] let&#39;s talk about the Five Points number
[5791.36s] one this is the silliest statement I&#39;ve
[5793.6s] ever seen an analyst put in writing
[5795.36s] quote we estimate a roughly 30 billion
[5797.08s] Equity raised to get back to zero net
[5798.84s] debt why would they ever go into zero
[5800.679s] net debt when did Dave Ramsey become
[5802.48s] Boeing&#39;s new financial adviser number
[5804.4s] two why is RO Reuters quoting an analyst
[5807.28s] who is ranked quote three out of five
[5809.6s] stars for accuracy you can&#39;t make this
[5812.56s] stuff up number three
[5814.32s] why would they start a new plane in
[5816.4s] fears of losing share when their
[5818.159s] competitor already has a backlog as
[5820.159s] large as theirs spanning a decade out
[5822.6s] for plane models they already produce
[5825.239s] it&#39;s like oh let&#39;s start a new plane
[5827.52s] that we can&#39;t afford to start even
[5829.199s] though we can&#39;t even deliver 10 years
[5831.639s] worth of orders worth $500 billion do of
[5835.199s] backlog let&#39;s start a new
[5837.239s] product you can&#39;t make this stuff up and
[5839.88s] furthermore let&#39;s raise $30 billion of
[5842.44s] equity and dude our shareholders for a
[5845.08s] product that we don&#39;t even need for a
[5848.84s] decade okay common sense is the most
[5851.199s] uncommon thing so number four even the
[5855.04s] analyst seeds quote their free cash flow
[5858.119s] could Spike to 20 billion dollars a year
[5860.719s] if they delay their next airplane
[5862.679s] development cycle duh I wonder what
[5865.4s] they&#39;re going to do number five I will
[5868.599s] be sending this analyst a Christmas card
[5870.96s] for allowing us to expand our position
[5872.96s] in the high 150s we are grateful for
[5875.52s] your service please write several more
[5877.679s] notes so we can add more size at lower
[5880.0s] prices and number six total company
[5883.119s] backlog is
[5885.08s] $516 billion including over 5,400
[5889.28s] commercial airplanes for those worried
[5891.52s] about the quote health of Boeing may I
[5894.639s] offer you the world&#39;s smallest violin
[5897.679s] they&#39;ll be just fine only a matter of
[5900.639s] when not if and we scroll up so you can
[5905.32s] see the world&#39;s smallest violin moving
[5913.84s] on key catalyst is the new CEO Kelly
[5917.56s] ortberg who started on August 8th as CEO
[5921.4s] of Rockwell Collins he doubled sales in
[5923.32s] six years and quadrupled 4x the value of
[5925.679s] the company for shareholders before
[5927.52s] selling it at a price premium to United
[5929.48s] Technologies in 2019
[5935.04s] um and so on so then we go into a nice
[5938.4s] report from Morning Star I like morning
[5940.28s] star&#39;s framework because they&#39;re all
[5941.719s] Buffet ties if you go out to the annual
[5943.28s] meetings they&#39;re always there they have
[5945.04s] a good investment framework and I you
[5948.4s] know we&#39;re running 112 all right we
[5950.48s] could go through some of these points
[5951.719s] but you can read it on your own the key
[5954.08s] here is
[5955.84s] that there are only two players in town
[5958.32s] they have 99% of the market there&#39;s a
[5960.04s] Chinese player that&#39;s uh their their
[5962.52s] planes go
[5964.0s] Boeing&#39;s planes go 75% further they
[5966.76s] don&#39;t compete on any metric so they&#39;ll
[5968.52s] sell a bunch of crappy planes to their
[5970.0s] own Chinese Airlines no one outside of
[5972.04s] China is going to buy a Chinese airplane
[5974.08s] that I can guarantee you and even the
[5976.44s] ones inside if they want to be
[5977.84s] competitive they got to have Boeing and
[5979.08s] Airbus so uh
[5982.0s] um the Chinese company will maybe take
[5984.88s] if they&#39;re lucky uh let&#39;s see arj21
[5990.199s] that&#39;s a company called comac they&#39;ve
[5993.159s] been trying to do this for 10 15 years
[5996.28s] Chinese carrier uh carriers took
[5998.679s] delivery of
[6000.44s] 30 almost 30 aircraft per month on
[6003.88s] average we have no reason to believe
[6005.199s] that ramping up the larger and more
[6007.0s] complex c919 will be an easier process
[6009.719s] than ramping up arj which has taken them
[6011.96s] you know 15 plus years and um the 737
[6016.52s] Max 7 for instance can travel roughly
[6019.159s] 75% more nautical miles than than comx
[6023.36s] similar size c919 and the economics
[6025.639s] Drive Airline purchase
[6028.159s] decisions in some the technical
[6030.28s] complexity of aircraft manufacturing is
[6032.719s] a material barrier to entry which we
[6034.32s] believe constitutes intangible Boeing
[6036.08s] and Airbus are the only two capable
[6037.44s] suppliers of globally competitive
[6039.08s] aircraft larger than 130 seats and we
[6041.08s] don&#39;t see any Global competitive new
[6042.36s] entrance entering the market anytime
[6043.76s] soon therefore we believe it&#39;s
[6044.76s] reasonable to assume that almost all
[6046.32s] Global demand for new air CL will flow
[6048.04s] through the income statement of a
[6049.28s] comment incumbents that we conc that
[6051.32s] some Chinese demand will likely move
[6052.719s] toward com
[6054.239s] back um Market is large enough and
[6057.679s] unders supplied enough to support two
[6059.32s] wide modes we built a 20-year aviation
[6061.4s] forecast for
[6062.8s] deliveries Etc Market will return to
[6065.28s] undersupplied state that both
[6066.84s] manufacturers will continue to benefit
[6068.36s] from barriers to entry and switching
[6070.08s] costs from lack of alternative suppliers
[6072.36s] I mean this is this is a business made
[6073.92s] in
[6075.52s] heaven
[6077.44s] uh they talk about the military business
[6080.4s] etc etc so it&#39;s a great read there
[6084.8s] talk about the backlog talk about the
[6087.599s] Outlook uh traffic is back to where it&#39;s
[6090.0s] projected continued growth continued
[6092.56s] demand uh continued Monopoly what else
[6095.28s] could you ask for earnings Russell small
[6098.08s] cap earnings estimates last 60 days up
[6101.56s] 2.19% for next year this year Le becomes
[6104.52s] less we only got three more months left
[6107.119s] uh and for next year on S&amp;P up 76% which
[6112.84s] is also Al positive so estimates keep
[6115.119s] going up not down everyone&#39;s been
[6116.639s] waiting for them to go down they&#39;re
[6117.719s] going up up up tomorrow what are we
[6120.76s] looking for estimates are 164,000
[6124.159s] non-farm payroll so I think below 100
[6127.119s] people would get nervous and start to
[6128.599s] price in a 50 basis point cut I think at
[6131.88s] uh above 200 maybe people would get a
[6135.32s] little nervous about no cut but I they
[6138.08s] already told you they&#39;re going to do a
[6139.239s] cut so I think you want to see a number
[6141.599s] above 164
[6145.52s] like I think 140 to 180 is good and that
[6151.159s] probably gets the market back uh getting
[6153.719s] bid again for the next week and a half
[6156.32s] uh below 100 I don&#39;t know above
[6160.4s] 250 I don&#39;t know but you know anywhere
[6163.84s] in the middle Market&#39;s going to like
[6166.92s] it all
[6169.119s] right podcast is over now we do ask me

[6213.719s] that see it the longer I&#39;m going to do
[6214.96s] it for non-clients so do that and
[6217.84s] benefit and uh and share it with your
[6220.159s] friends if you got value the best thing
[6222.639s] you can do rather than the compliment is
[6225.92s] email the link tonight to one of your
[6227.92s] friends that loves markets and uh
[6230.719s] preferably has some money and after they
[6233.239s] listen to me for a year or two they&#39;ll
[6234.599s] become an investor but uh at the just
[6237.639s] anyone you can help is really what it
[6238.96s] comes down to uh okay my question is
[6241.88s] broader view of options you had
[6243.4s] mentioned in a call that you made 3 to
[6245.04s] 4X on options and we&#39;ve made a lot more
[6247.44s] than that by the way uh on others uh to
[6251.08s] understand and learn options how you
[6252.52s] work on call spread versus put spread as
[6255.04s] these turnaround takes 12 months plus if
[6257.32s] it&#39;s a client uh high level knowledge
[6260.52s] read all the McMillan books options as a
[6262.8s] in strategy you got to learn all the
[6265.679s] Greeks and then it&#39;s just
[6267.88s] experience um yeah I I mean everyone
[6271.92s] wants one year sentences the key is
[6273.639s] start with the base knowledge that&#39;s all
[6275.239s] the McMillan books on options first you
[6277.56s] have to have the base framework then you
[6279.28s] have to understand markets then you have
[6280.8s] to understand the underlying
[6281.76s] fundamentals of the stock and and the
[6283.679s] spreads are just a way to magnify the
[6286.52s] return on an individual idea which we do
[6289.56s] uh exclusively for clients and that&#39;s
[6291.239s] the secret sauce that they get over time
[6294.119s] uh and benefit from so you&#39;re not
[6295.639s] getting everything for free clients have
[6297.119s] an edge uh and they largely underwrite
[6299.48s] the benefits that you get from the
[6301.48s] podcast but uh that&#39;s where I would
[6303.119s] start and thank you so much for watching
[6305.36s] listening and sharing Frank Brown I hope
[6307.84s] you had a great holiday weekend really L
[6309.76s] listening to your recent podcast with
[6311.8s] Brendan Ahern as well by the way in your
[6314.92s] pod I was laughing so hard when you
[6316.32s] mentioned I don&#39;t use Callaway while
[6318.52s] reviewing Top Golf I just wanted to your
[6321.599s] overall thoughts on Gap
[6323.88s] by the way I got that new driver from
[6326.56s] Crank it&#39;s the one that um Bryson D
[6330.0s] Shambo uses crank golf think it sounds
[6332.84s] like an eastn baseball bat and what&#39;s
[6335.8s] amazing about it is because I play
[6337.679s] blades I play misso blades for my irons
[6340.8s] and I I got the ultra jumbo grips too
[6342.88s] the ultra light don&#39;t get the regular
[6344.36s] ones because it messes up the swing
[6345.679s] weight um and that&#39;s kept my hands so
[6348.0s] quiet which is why I think I&#39;m hitting
[6349.199s] the ball great again um
[6353.159s] but that crank driver you get away with
[6355.119s] murder and the thing just smashes so uh
[6358.92s] check that out too I know a lot of you
[6360.599s] have picked up lab Putters and uh are
[6363.36s] are loving it as much as I do so look
[6365.92s] I&#39;m just sharing my process I I you know
[6368.239s] I&#39;m the guy asking the am asking the
[6370.36s] amas when it comes to golf not answering
[6372.56s] them uh so uh uh you know if you&#39;re
[6375.52s] following my process H you know that I&#39;m
[6377.76s] just telling you what I&#39;m I&#39;m benefiting
[6379.36s] from these days all right wanted your
[6381.52s] oval TOS on Gap as a consumer
[6385.92s] discretionary oh this is the
[6388.119s] perennial train wreck of a company they
[6391.04s] never seem to get it
[6392.44s] right and it always looks
[6395.239s] attractive uh we did this a few weeks
[6397.36s] ago and I said no I I&#39;m still not going
[6399.52s] to change my mind on that but thanks
[6401.159s] Frank I know it&#39;s cheap I know all that
[6403.119s] stuff they just seem to continually
[6405.639s] snatch Victory from the jaws of
[6408.08s] defeat or excuse me snatch defeat from
[6410.88s] the jaws of Victory uh uh venod we
[6414.239s] covered
[6417.36s] you Kayla Smith enjoy the
[6421.36s] show uh here&#39;s an odd one do you have
[6424.04s] any thoughts on Western
[6426.36s] Union uh we covered this one like two or
[6428.92s] three months ago the answer was no it is
[6431.56s] cheap it&#39;ll probably stay cheap it&#39;s
[6434.44s] maybe a trading vehicle up to 20 but uh
[6437.44s] I don&#39;t not for
[6439.28s] me thanks for tuning in and thanks for
[6441.96s] the kind words
[6449.4s] Sam Boeing you like Boeing but Airbus
[6452.56s] has a similar market cap and less debt
[6454.719s] similar Revenue also why don&#39;t you
[6457.08s] prefer Airbus the only thing I like from
[6459.28s] France is their cheese next question
[6462.52s] Drew burn appreciate your first class
[6464.84s] weekly content and media appearances I
[6467.639s] keep spreading the word grateful for
[6469.159s] your thoughts on initiating the small
[6471.4s] qxo position it&#39;s not that small by the
[6474.08s] way uh don&#39;t take it that
[6478.56s] I&#39;m
[6480.119s] jock yeah we bought it after the
[6482.28s] dilution so our basis is
[6485.159s] $12.69 I think um and its liquidation
[6490.239s] value is
[6492.239s] $670 uh so I&#39;m giving the guy 100%
[6495.56s] credit 100% premium because he&#39;s Brad
[6498.239s] Jacobs and he&#39;s the only guy that&#39;s ever
[6499.92s] compounded money at double digits
[6502.239s] consistently overtime across five
[6503.92s] companies and made tens of billions of
[6506.239s] dollars for his owners so it would be
[6508.28s] basically like saying hey there&#39;s a guy
[6510.159s] named Warren Buffett you know if Warren
[6512.199s] Buffett started a new insurance vehicle
[6514.48s] and said I&#39;m going to rebuild birkshire
[6516.8s] uh I&#39;d be interested so this guy&#39;s done
[6518.639s] it five times creates multi Baggers
[6520.8s] every time he does it and I got to pay
[6523.239s] two times cash to have a free option on
[6526.36s] him doing another deal and a roll up in
[6528.119s] the Home Building Supply business which
[6530.719s] is going to Boom for the next 10 years
[6532.32s] because of the the starter home
[6534.8s] explosion from the Millennials or
[6536.719s] biggest generation for the next 10 years
[6538.96s] and I get to bet on the best jockey
[6540.4s] who&#39;s ever done it in history who
[6541.76s] doesn&#39;t do stupid deals who does a
[6543.56s] creative deals and um and uh respects
[6547.08s] ownership and put up a billion dollars
[6549.199s] of his own money side by side so oh
[6552.239s] excuse me he&#39;s got it $2 cheaper than I
[6554.639s] do and if you do the math he gets 10 to
[6557.76s] 15% of the industry which is $60 billion
[6561.119s] with a 10 to 15% free cash flow yield
[6565.56s] you basically have a 10 bagger over a
[6567.52s] decade so for me if I pay $6 or I paid
[6571.52s] $12 I&#39;d rather pay six that was never on
[6575.08s] the table some people got in at nine and
[6577.48s] change God bless them they&#39;re smarter
[6579.4s] than I am so they got a $3 better deal
[6582.36s] I&#39;m paying over cash but I&#39;m betting on
[6584.48s] a winner so there&#39;s nothing to think
[6586.8s] about here so yeah we bought it after
[6588.92s] the delution when it fell from whatever
[6590.92s] it was 60 to
[6593.159s] 10 or whatever
[6595.92s] qxo yeah there were some idiots when
[6597.92s] there was no float traded up to 290 when
[6600.32s] a crash down to 10 we started building
[6602.719s] and and got again at 12269 it could
[6606.56s] easily go to to cash value if he doesn&#39;t
[6608.56s] do a deal and if he does do a deal it
[6610.32s] could pop to $20 overnight
[6612.639s] so I like it
[6617.36s] um
[6621.48s] next by Gman uh thank you for your data
[6625.48s] and historically driven
[6627.04s] opinion I have
[6631.239s] several of your client stocks in my
[6633.44s] portfolio well you don&#39;t know exactly
[6635.199s] what my client stocks are uh your
[6637.639s] opinion on o
[6640.92s] xlc o
[6646.48s] xlc Oxford Lane Capital Corp no interest
[6649.36s] in anything like this too opaque you&#39;re
[6651.76s] never going to know what&#39;s in their
[6652.88s] portfolio so pass but thank you for
[6655.76s] sending it John
[6657.8s] Lee uh thanks for your insights as
[6660.52s] always my question is if you had a small
[6662.719s] sum of money would you rather buy a
[6664.239s] great business at a fair price or an
[6665.56s] average business at a great price if
[6667.44s] neither what approach would you
[6669.04s] generally follow if you had a small sum
[6671.84s] of money uh I take all that money and
[6674.599s] invest in education because you&#39;re not
[6676.32s] going to compound a small amount of
[6677.56s] money into anything meaningful so invest
[6679.76s] in your own skill sets get your earnings
[6681.48s] power up so you have a large amount of
[6683.0s] money to compound and um look I like
[6687.04s] turnarounds turnaround Tom and that
[6689.0s] doesn&#39;t mean I&#39;m buying the best best
[6690.639s] businesses I&#39;m just buying businesses
[6692.119s] that are down enough with a margin of
[6693.679s] safety where solvency risk is at or off
[6697.0s] near or off the table and then I just
[6699.36s] play the time Arbitrage game and get a
[6701.079s] double or triple in a few years and on
[6702.96s] to the next uh that&#39;s what I do so you
[6705.719s] could say oh why don&#39;t you just buy
[6707.119s] businesses with a 20% return on Capital
[6709.119s] and hold them forever because nothing&#39;s
[6710.719s] forever so people are going to see those
[6712.92s] and they&#39;re going to Rod at their things
[6714.48s] and you know everyone looks in hindsight
[6716.36s] bias if you just bought monster beverage
[6718.56s] I mean look at Celsius the thing is down
[6720.56s] 75% same same story as Monster and
[6723.4s] completely different results so
[6725.199s] hindsight bias is is very
[6727.599s] misleading Davis but when I buy with a
[6730.36s] margin save I know can get that double
[6732.079s] or triple in a few years in aggregate
[6734.199s] I&#39;ll do that all day long that&#39;s all I
[6735.56s] need to do everyone&#39;s happy Divas lung
[6738.8s] Tom I&#39;ve been listening to your podcast
[6740.159s] for a while enjoying every moment of
[6741.48s] free content was wondering ing what your
[6743.4s] opinion is on B&#39;s recent drop is there
[6745.52s] enough margin of safety for you to take
[6746.8s] a look yes I&#39;m only going to participate
[6749.28s] in China through Alibaba I mean I think
[6752.079s] there are a lot of risk for search
[6753.8s] they&#39;re the Google of
[6756.56s] um China uh and I&#39;m not smart enough to
[6760.52s] figure out how big how great their mode
[6763.52s] is my guess is this when China goes up B
[6767.639s] is going to do just fine and go up as
[6769.199s] well but for me I have outs we talk
[6772.04s] about this every week poker lots of outs
[6774.199s] I got the cloud I got the the non-core
[6776.76s] business I got all the AI stuff that we
[6778.96s] own that I don&#39;t even know uh every
[6781.159s] single startup AI startup equity&#39;s got
[6784.159s] uh alibaba&#39;s got equity in through
[6786.36s] exchanging them credits with the AI with
[6789.159s] um compute power so um for shipo I&#39;ve
[6794.159s] got uh aidc growing at 32% a year tbell
[6798.079s] and te- all turning around so there&#39;s a
[6799.639s] lot of ways to win with bu do it&#39;s
[6801.48s] binary there search uh it stays
[6803.159s] competitive or it doesn&#39;t and I&#39;m not
[6805.32s] smart enough to figure that out so
[6808.239s] um or predict that
[6812.36s] future
[6817.48s] next
[6819.599s] uh it&#39;s talking about autosar which we
[6824.0s] covered do you think that the rate Cuts
[6826.119s] along with dealer incentives can move
[6827.8s] enough vehicles that are piling up over
[6829.96s] ice and hybrid yes sooner or later and
[6832.719s] the key thing is don&#39;t do it on Leverage
[6834.48s] they&#39;ve got their cost basis down to a
[6836.04s] decent level we&#39;d rather it sooner
[6837.92s] rather than later but it&#39;ll happen and
[6839.679s] when it happens it happens all at
[6841.56s] once
[6845.52s] um okay next is that&#39;s it we&#39;re done see
[6851.48s] you next week same time same place I&#39;ll
[6853.92s] be back in New York by then in the
[6855.8s] meantime client potential clients out in
[6858.239s] California Coffee 30 minutes in Orange
[6861.079s] County maybe even LA County but really
[6864.28s] Orange County happy to do it um and
[6867.88s] thank you all for tuning in in the
[6870.079s] meantime make it a great one bye for now
