### August 22nd 2024

**Executive Summary**
> This episode is extremely bullish on Alibaba, highlighting its potential for significant growth due to policy changes, new buyers, and a weakening dollar. It also emphasizes the importance of being contrarian and taking advantage of market dislocations, particularly in value stocks and emerging markets. Tom is also pounding the table on Cooper Standard.

**Tom's Current Market Conviction: Constructive in the intermediate term, with short-term strength followed by potential weakness ahead of the election, and then a year-end rally. → 8/10** 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥☆☆

- Earnings are strong enough to justify a year-end rally.
- Rates are down far enough to justify a year-end rally.
- Estimated 15.2% earnings growth for 2025.
- Increased money supply (half a trillion dollars since the beginning of the year).
- The FED will start to ease.

## Macro Thesis & Key Data Points
The macro thesis revolves around a weakening dollar, increased money supply, and a potential shift in market leadership from US equities to emerging markets, particularly China. The FED is expected to cut rates, which will further weaken the dollar and benefit emerging markets. There is also a focus on value stocks and the potential for significant outperformance in the unmagnified 493 stocks of the S&P 500.

| Indicator | Value | Tom's Interpretation |
|-----------|-------|----------------------|
| Money Supply | Increased by half a trillion dollars since the beginning of the year | You cannot fight the increased money supply. |
| Earnings Growth (Unmagnified S&P 493) | -4% in 2023 to +6.5% this year to 13.5% next year | The good news is you can make a tremendous amount of money in the 493 that have lagged where you can find Value. |
| Small Cap Earnings Growth | -12.2% in 2023, +7.3% this year, +37.6% next year | If you're skeptical about small caps because because they had a little sell down because of the Yen nonsense uh you're going to miss the boat ladies and gentlemen it's going to move bigly in our view |
| Vehicle Incentives | 7% of total purchase price, highest in 3 years | Incentives are the name of the game when you want volume. We are not in the business of Ford and GM making as much money per car as possible we are in the business of Ford and GM making as many cars as possible that is the critical name of the game |
| Initial Jobless Claims | Big Numbers | FED is going to move this is big news and that supports all of our portfolio we're we're lined up for it |
