[134.68s] that ETF K kweb has five billion of
[138.519s] assets under management uh so we&#39;re
[140.72s] going to get to that what we&#39;re first
[142.519s] going to do quickly in the first 10
[144.44s] minutes here is do the US overview
[147.08s] because I know a lot of you want to get
[148.8s] to that right now uh the first one we&#39;re
[151.0s] going to cover is vne and Company I want
[153.56s] to thank Stuart vanney Christian dagger
[156.04s] and Preston Melle for having me on we
[159.72s] discussed um PayPal and gxo and PayPal
[163.319s] is important PayPal&#39;s been up went from
[165.159s] 59 to 72 in the last couple of two three
[168.12s] weeks uh you want to hear about that and
[171.239s] here we go cuz we have a nice rally
[173.56s] going on our hands here Dow up 300
[175.84s] NASDAQ up 250 it&#39;s come down a little
[178.12s] bit from where we open the market but
[179.84s] that&#39;s still solid rally Thomas Hayes
[181.959s] joins me to inspect this market gain
[184.92s] here um let me get this right I read
[187.44s] your stuff you&#39;re suggesting we get a
[189.879s] bit of a dip in the relatively near term
[192.519s] and then at the end of the year a nice
[194.36s] solid re year end rally is that it I
[197.2s] think in the short term stew when the
[199.0s] music is playing you got to get up and
[200.48s] dance that&#39;s what we&#39;re going to do for
[201.799s] the next few weeks however we&#39;ve got the
[204.2s] first fed cut coming in September I
[206.72s] think it&#39;s going to be a case of buy the
[208.239s] rumor sell the news a little volatility
[211.2s] after that first cut a little volatility
[213.239s] into the uncertainty of the election
[215.2s] once that&#39;s resolved we get a year- end
[216.879s] rally no we get a year end rally we get
[219.12s] a year profits are strong enough to
[220.72s] justify that and rates are down far
[222.519s] enough to justify that year-end rally
[224.319s] that&#39;s right we&#39;ve got estimated 15.2%
[227.239s] earnings growth for
[228.92s] 2025 uh things are strong we just saw
[231.12s] earning season up 10.8% versus 88.9%
[234.319s] estimates margins are holding in there
[236.239s] so and estimates are actually steadily
[237.76s] climbing up so on balance Things Are
[240.0s] strong little strength here enjoy the
[241.84s] fun the next few weeks get a little
[243.599s] defensive ahead of the election and then
[245.2s] year end rally uh we&#39;re constructive uh
[247.68s] looking out in the intermediate term do
[249.28s] we get a year-end rally of carel Harris
[251.2s] is the next president of the United
[252.28s] States I don&#39;t want to get political
[253.48s] with you but that&#39;s an important
[254.72s] question it&#39;s no question I think the
[256.68s] number one thing for the stock market
[258.0s] look one candidate is pro business one
[260.68s] candidate is pro government so there is
[262.72s] that dichotomy right there what the
[264.8s] stock market needs to see historically
[266.479s] is gridlock they want politicians to be
[268.6s] able to do less so so long as one party
[271.759s] doesn&#39;t get all three branches then
[273.72s] we&#39;ll be certainly okay you got a couple
[275.84s] of stock picks I want to start with gxo
[278.639s] Logistics where is it now 48 bucks a
[281.32s] share where&#39;s it going okay this stock
[283.44s] fell 50% why they do Outsource supply
[285.84s] chain and Logistics management the
[287.68s] reason is because you saw the shift from
[289.919s] Goods during covid to Services that&#39;s
[292.12s] balancing out that trough in Q4 of 2023
[296.639s] we&#39;ve gone from the destocking cycle to
[298.8s] the restocking cycle the operating
[300.479s] leverage in this business is huge
[302.12s] management is expecting iida to nearly
[304.56s] double by 2027 so that implies the stock
[307.56s] could not only double but you get
[309.24s] multiple expansion once they get the
[310.919s] double digigit earnings growth and
[312.24s] double digigit Revenue growth back so we
[314.28s] think this stock can go up to $100 over
[317.039s] the next 24 to 36 months too no you
[319.28s] really do like it the next one is Paypal
[322.36s] okay everyone hates this yeah uh this is
[324.56s] a great business why is it a great
[326.08s] business cuz Alex Chris came from into
[328.12s] it he ran half the business at into it
[330.039s] the stock was a 38 bagger while he was
[332.52s] there he&#39;s coming to PayPal he&#39;s
[334.6s] increasing the margins he&#39;s got this uh
[336.6s] branded checkout called uh that
[338.84s] increases conversion to 50% at at the
[341.759s] checkout to 80% what does that mean it
[343.919s] means he can charge more so margins are
[345.919s] going up they were supposed to do $5
[347.8s] billion of free cash flow this year he
[349.52s] said no we&#39;re not going to do five
[350.639s] billion we&#39;re going to do six billion oh
[352.24s] and by the way we&#39;re not going to buy
[353.56s] back $5 billion of stock we&#39;re going to
[355.4s] buy back $6 billion of stock this thing
[357.72s] is turning the corner $4 29 million
[360.4s] accounts 10% of global Enterprise spend
[363.0s] when you take an Uber stew I know you
[364.56s] love to take Ubers that goes through
[366.759s] PayPal through brain tree you don&#39;t see
[368.56s] PayPal but PayPal&#39;s getting a piece that
[370.44s] action $500 billion of of A5 trillion
[373.919s] over the
[375.16s] stock sorry you went through all this
[377.919s] very complicated reasoning on those two
[379.759s] stocks you never look down you haven&#39;t
[381.12s] got any notes in front of you falling
[382.56s] your head very impressive it&#39;s amazing
[384.56s] when you have money at stake how serious
[386.44s] you get about the stocks well said some
[389.24s] well said Thomas thanks for joining us
[391.039s] Thomas for soon all right and we&#39;re back
[395.319s] and then on Friday I joined Charles
[398.36s] Payne on Fox Business want to thank
[400.28s] Charles Nick Palazo for having me on
[403.919s] this was an exciting segment we
[405.8s] discussed all kinds of seasonality and
[407.44s] everything else the elections but we
[409.319s] discussed Boeing and we discussed Cooper
[411.599s] standard I want you to listen closely to
[413.36s] this one this is another one that&#39;s on
[415.039s] the move again excited about that
[418.76s] [Music]
[420.039s] all right so my next see notes that
[421.4s] earnings margins and estimates that
[422.96s] they&#39;ve held up but the Cavalry has to
[426.28s] come no later than September joining me
[428.199s] now great Hill Capital chairman Thomas
[429.96s] Hayes all right Thomas who&#39;s coming to
[432.0s] the rescue well I think it&#39;s time for
[433.879s] the FED to come to the rescue uh we have
[436.12s] a little bit of election year
[437.52s] seasonality right now we&#39;ve got this
[439.16s] August strength which is normal since
[441.639s] 1955 August is strong the early part of
[444.56s] in in in election years years since 1955
[448.24s] so you get a strong August you get
[449.68s] strong first half of September but
[451.319s] interestingly enough it rolls over late
[453.919s] September early October which is
[455.639s] coincident with the Cavalry coming doing
[458.199s] the first cut and what we also know
[459.96s] historically is the market tends to sell
[462.12s] off after the first cut even though it&#39;s
[464.479s] often up 12 months out Etc so I think uh
[468.039s] a little bit of strength let&#39;s let&#39;s
[469.479s] dance while they&#39;re playing the music
[471.039s] right and then get a little conservative
[472.8s] ahead of the election and and year and
[474.44s] rally so that&#39;s interesting because I I
[476.639s] I&#39;ve always kind of seen you as a Buy
[477.879s] and Hold not necessar guy who says hey
[479.759s] we&#39;ve got to be a little bit Nimble here
[481.44s] yeah uh also though uh you&#39;re not big on
[483.8s] a ma 7even you do point out that their
[485.759s] earnings growth is decelerating while
[487.759s] the rest of the S&amp;P is going up but I
[489.96s] I&#39;m going to put on the screen now this
[491.159s] is just one of the it&#39;s decelerating but
[493.72s] for next year Max 7 that 20% is still
[496.8s] the best outside the Russell 2000 right
[498.96s] so even though equal weight is going to
[501.479s] go to 12% from 5% and overall S&amp;P 7 14%
[505.44s] from 7% 20% is nothing to sneeze at is
[508.319s] it no it&#39;s absolutely not and I think
[510.599s] the theme Here is that they&#39;re going to
[512.88s] have relative underperformance so under
[515.839s] the surface the unmagnify you&#39;re going
[518.08s] to see some stocks double you&#39;re going
[519.519s] to see some stock triple there aren&#39;t
[520.959s] many mag s stocks you&#39;re going to see
[522.44s] double and triple over the next 12 18 24
[524.8s] months you&#39;re actually seeing it with
[526.08s] all these activists buying up these
[527.64s] cheap stocks that we&#39;re talking about
[529.04s] you know like Nike you saw Amman like
[530.88s] Ulta you saw birkshire like Starbucks
[533.399s] you see Elliott so you see the activist
[535.279s] starting to get into this cheap value
[537.24s] and I think that&#39;s going to be the theme
[538.399s] for the next 18 months I&#39;ve been
[540.0s] pointing that out to my subscribers as
[541.56s] well you could see it in some of these
[543.32s] been some of these sessions we like whoa
[544.92s] this is and these are names that are
[547.04s] huge and just you know that you can
[549.16s] sleep at night right and you know listen
[551.32s] new management is amazing I love when a
[553.32s] company brings on New Management um okay
[555.959s] let&#39;s talk about money supply before we
[557.519s] get to the stocks because money supply
[559.24s] you saying is picking up so between
[561.04s] money supply picking up and a friendly
[562.76s] or fed isn&#39;t that a pretty good gust of
[565.32s] win in the Sounds in the market no
[567.2s] question about it so I think we get
[568.839s] through this period here little bit of
[570.519s] strength little weakness a little
[571.76s] uncertainty ahead of the election but
[573.24s] you cannot fight the increased money
[575.36s] supply half a trillion dollars since the
[577.12s] beginning of the year the FED will start
[579.24s] to ease all the risk that we&#39;re seeing
[581.2s] the cracks onto the surface defaults
[582.839s] increasing auto loans delinquencies Etc
[586.079s] they need the Cavalry needs to come to
[588.399s] ameliorate that because if you get into
[590.04s] a situation we saw little cracks in the
[592.04s] labor market if they let that go we
[594.079s] could start to face deflation and
[596.079s] deflation is very hard to fix inflation
[597.8s] they can manage I got one minute let&#39;s
[599.44s] go over two stocks Boeing speaking of
[601.2s] New Management now it wasn&#39;t Larry col
[603.519s] which I&#39;m glad because I own G stock but
[605.959s] this guy&#39;s got a got a pretty good
[607.48s] resume yeah Kelly ortberg he uh Rockwell
[610.16s] Collins he got there it was A7 billion
[612.839s] market cap in 2012 he sold the business
[615.36s] for 30 billion 6 years later this this
[617.72s] guy knows how to create shareholder
[619.72s] value in Industrials and the does he
[621.399s] know how to keep a door on a plane well
[623.839s] this is the beauty finally at Boeing
[625.72s] we&#39;re going to have an engineer versus a
[627.64s] Salesman running the company his first
[629.72s] day he spent on the floor of the factory
[632.839s] and the United CEO he met with yesterday
[634.68s] he says I&#39;ve got renewed confidence in
[636.519s] Boeing now that I&#39;ve met with the new
[638.279s] CEO this is a great thing at the end of
[640.2s] the day it&#39;s a duopoly it&#39;s good to be
[641.8s] the king if you don&#39;t want to play it&#39;s
[643.399s] not only a duopoly but if you look at
[645.2s] the demand for aircraft commercial
[646.88s] aircraft for the next 20 years this was
[649.079s] a stock that I used to tell people never
[650.76s] to sell and it&#39;s almost going to get
[652.16s] back there less than 30 seconds um uh
[655.0s] Cooper standard what is yeah we bought
[656.6s] this in May of 2022 at $510 s they
[659.72s] refinanced the debt went up to 22 now
[661.92s] it&#39;s back down to 13 we haven&#39;t sold a
[663.519s] share we bought more shares and I&#39;ll
[665.12s] tell you why every single cycle in the
[667.32s] last 45 years you&#39;ve had 18 million SAR
[670.32s] is the peak the sell through total
[672.04s] vehicle sales in the United States we&#39;re
[673.72s] at 15.8 right now if they just get to
[676.44s] 16.1 forget about 18 which they&#39;ll do
[678.639s] this cycle the the business is going to
[680.399s] earn $3 a share you add a trough
[682.36s] multiple of 10 times you got a $30 stock
[684.56s] you add a peak multiple of 20 times you
[686.2s] have a $60 stock and God forbid we
[688.24s] actually get to $18 million SAR Peak
[690.8s] this thing could fly so we&#39;re excited
[692.24s] about this one all right good stuff man
[694.04s] I like that you bring these ideas that
[695.72s] no one else is talking about appreciate
[698.2s] it all right folks K
[700.399s] Harris and we&#39;re back and then finally I
[704.04s] went over to Yahoo finance to talk with
[707.6s] Julie Heyman uh about uh one stock to uh
[713.56s] one stock that we like and one one stock
[716.48s] sector that we would avoid want to thank
[718.6s] Haley mark and Julie Hyman for having me
[720.639s] on
[722.37s] [Music]
[727.44s] there it&#39;s a big noisy Universe of
[730.04s] stocks out there welcome to goodbye or
[731.88s] goodbye our goal to help cut through
[734.199s] that noise to navigate the best moves
[735.639s] for your portfolio today we&#39;re taking a
[737.639s] look at cyclical and defensive stocks
[739.8s] I&#39;m here with Thomas Hayes Great Hall
[741.399s] Capital chairman and managing member
[743.6s] thanks for being this home good to see
[744.839s] you so the your buy stock is a cyclical
[747.76s] stock right so we&#39;re talking about
[749.68s] gxo Logistics this stock has not done
[752.68s] great over the past year it&#39;s down a
[754.12s] little more than 20% this is one of the
[756.56s] spins of the former XPO Logistics which
[759.519s] is Brad Jacobs creation and um you like
[763.92s] that uh he is involved in this
[765.76s] particular company as well yeah Brad
[767.88s] Jacobs has the mightest touch if you got
[769.56s] involved when he did United Rentals you
[772.279s] made a 47 bagger if you got involved
[775.0s] when he got involved in xbo logistics if
[777.639s] you invested 1 million you got 30 1
[779.48s] million so he knows how to create value
[781.48s] for shareholders so you ask well then
[783.279s] why is the stock down so much that would
[785.199s] be my next question yes so um this
[787.639s] business does well they get paid for
[789.519s] Outsource Goods okay so they do supply
[792.079s] chain Outsource Logistics and there was
[794.48s] a huge demand for goods during covid and
[797.079s] then the demand shifted to services and
[799.44s] their business the stock basically
[800.839s] collapsed the business did okay and now
[803.399s] that has troughed Okay so we&#39;ve gone
[805.399s] from the destocking cycle which troughed
[807.92s] in Q4 of 2023 and now we&#39;re starting the
[810.88s] restocking cycle and they have huge
[813.24s] Tailwinds behind them and basically
[814.76s] operate in a duopoly with DHL so let&#39;s
[817.56s] talk about the potential growth then
[819.68s] you&#39;re looking iida basically doubling
[822.24s] by 2027 this is guidance from the
[824.639s] company they expect eida to nearly
[826.519s] double by 2027 and what&#39;s interesting
[828.72s] about that Julie is not just W well if
[830.68s] eida doubles maybe the stock could
[832.079s] double when you get that type of double
[834.16s] digit growth rate back both on the top
[836.079s] line and the bottom line you get
[837.639s] multiple expansions so not only will the
[840.399s] business do well but the multiple
[842.079s] applied to the stock could actually
[843.8s] expand in the meantime and that&#39;s why we
[845.279s] see reasonably significant upside to
[847.399s] this over the next two to three years
[848.839s] that&#39;s we kind of jumped the third point
[850.279s] a little bit in terms of that restocking
[852.8s] cycle just starting but it&#39;s interesting
[854.959s] when you talk about gxo and DHL I mean
[856.88s] if what&#39;s also interesting about that is
[858.759s] like I think everybody knows DHL as a
[860.72s] household name gxo is sort of less known
[863.959s] or recognized yeah he&#39;s not great with
[866.519s] branding but he makes billions of
[867.839s] dollars for his owners I got to be
[869.279s] honest I mean he consistently does that
[870.92s] you know they said something on the most
[872.199s] recent conference call last holiday
[874.6s] season was actually kind of a
[876.079s] disappointment for gxo for the retailers
[879.199s] Etc and what they&#39;re seeing right now in
[880.959s] the month of August he&#39;s saying the
[882.399s] clients are getting ready for a good
[884.12s] holiday season it won&#39;t be shoot the
[885.56s] lights out holiday season but it will be
[887.72s] more in line with a normalized holiday
[889.56s] season not a disappointment restocking
[891.839s] is happening this is very positive
[893.36s] Tailwind for gxo and uh they just
[896.279s] completed the Winton acquisition in the
[898.399s] UK so they they get close over 50% of
[901.04s] their business from Europe UK is
[903.04s] recovering Europe&#39;s recovering they just
[904.72s] did a huge warehouse for Levis in
[906.92s] Germany they&#39;re getting industrial
[909.04s] business from uh different manufacturers
[911.8s] like Boeing Etc uh all over the world so
[914.68s] they&#39;re expanding verticals they&#39;re
[916.759s] increasing the duration of contracts
[918.839s] with their clients and it&#39;s a very
[920.399s] sticky business once they outsourc their
[922.04s] business to you you got them for life
[923.68s] all right so what could go wrong well if
[926.68s] it&#39;s a cyclical stock yeah and that you
[929.68s] know restocking cycle doesn&#39;t
[931.88s] materialize that would be bad news yeah
[934.36s] that&#39;s a big thing I I think right now
[936.24s] the only thing that could cause the
[937.399s] recession is If the Fed Dithers uh they
[939.72s] do need to go in September we saw
[942.519s] starting to see some cracks in the labor
[944.04s] market starting to see some cracks and
[945.68s] defaults Rising even though they&#39;re
[947.04s] historically low auto loan defaults Etc
[949.88s] so if they move in September I think
[951.759s] we&#39;ve got the head we&#39;ve got the
[952.959s] Tailwinds from earnings we&#39;ve got the
[954.399s] Tailwinds from GDP and this will be Off
[956.44s] to the Races but if they get too cute
[958.48s] with their Cuts uh that could be a
[960.839s] problem gotcha okay now let&#39;s get to
[962.519s] your goodbye stock and this one&#39;s a
[963.88s] little contrarian here Tom we&#39;re talking
[966.36s] about utilities the XL you know this
[968.8s] group has been one of the winners of the
[970.56s] year right and it&#39;s up almost 20% over
[972.68s] the past year but you say let&#39;s hit the
[975.399s] pause button and in part is that after
[978.04s] the big runup that we have had yeah we
[980.12s] were pounding the table last fall when
[981.639s] you couldn&#39;t give away utilities
[982.959s] everyone said no one needs energy anym I
[984.68s] don&#39;t know what people were thinking but
[986.24s] basically there was an expectation about
[987.88s] rates that&#39;s different than the
[989.0s] expectation right now so this has
[990.959s] rallied on two basic things first of all
[994.12s] as a group this is a defensive sector
[996.44s] it&#39;s up 5050
[999.399s] % in less than a year so that tells me
[1002.399s] it&#39;s a little bit overdone here uh you
[1005.04s] know that that&#39;s a significant move and
[1007.6s] the the basis for this runup uh the AI
[1010.839s] narrative which is slowing down that
[1012.519s] that trade is cooling uh and cutting
[1015.6s] rates it&#39;s almost a buy the rumor maybe
[1018.48s] sell the news here right in other words
[1020.36s] people were buying an anticipation of
[1022.199s] the rate Cuts perhaps once they arrive
[1025.36s] the trade will lose some steam you think
[1027.24s] and finally it&#39;s a defensive stock and
[1029.72s] if you look at earnings if you look at
[1031.439s] GDP Etc I don&#39;t think you want to be
[1034.48s] overly defensive right now you&#39;ve seen
[1037.24s] Staples have run up a lot utilities have
[1039.24s] run up a lot um and you see it in fund
[1042.16s] managers and this is usually contrarian
[1044.24s] indicator they&#39;re 1.4 standard
[1046.36s] deviations overweight utilities above
[1048.52s] the long term average so it&#39;s what we
[1050.08s] like to call a crowded trade in other
[1051.679s] words it it is getting a little bit
[1053.36s] crowded and uh and I think it&#39;s a little
[1055.4s] bit overdone at the moment interesting
[1057.24s] okay so what could go right for
[1059.32s] utilities the exact it&#39;s the opposite of
[1061.72s] the other ones it&#39;s opposite day if we
[1064.12s] if the fed dids and we go into a
[1065.799s] recession you want to be in defensives
[1068.28s] and this would do well although given
[1070.24s] the multiple expansion that they&#39;ve had
[1071.84s] already it&#39;s like I don&#39;t see where the
[1073.48s] additional upside comes from well or or
[1076.2s] I guess if you have the continuation of
[1078.28s] the AI trade and you know is are the
[1081.08s] fortunes of Nvidia The Fortunes of the
[1083.28s] utilities for example as we continue to
[1085.2s] see a build out of AI infrastructure and
[1086.96s] the demand for power yeah it&#39;s part of
[1089.6s] it yes uh but I think a better
[1092.32s] derivative way to play that is through
[1093.96s] natural gas and I think those stocks are
[1095.72s] beaten down so these have priced in the
[1097.799s] possibility of great things happen the
[1099.36s] natural gas stocks are are trading like
[1101.0s] they&#39;re dead all right save that for
[1102.799s] another goodbye or goodbye I guess thank
[1106.08s] you so much for coming in appreciate it
[1108.159s] we we&#39;ll leave wanting more won&#39;t we on

[1155.64s] tell you we covered so much in detail
[1158.4s] about China the economy policy Alibaba
[1161.4s] other companies this chart right here uh
[1164.88s] the hangsang index I refer to numerous
[1168.44s] times during the conversation so you
[1170.679s] want to have this in front of you so you
[1173.36s] can see what I&#39;m referencing uh this is
[1176.28s] critically important to getting the most
[1178.08s] value so with that said here we go all
[1183.039s] right well we have a very special guest
[1185.039s] that we promised for you last week with
[1187.48s] Brendan Ahern from crane shares and I&#39;m
[1190.32s] so honored to have him on he runs the
[1192.919s] largest China Tech ETF I think somewhere
[1196.84s] around5 billion of assets under
[1199.32s] management so Brendan why don&#39;t you just
[1201.76s] uh tell our audience a little bit about
[1203.64s] yourself a little bit about your
[1205.159s] background and how you got involved with
[1207.28s] China of all things yeah yeah it was uh
[1210.12s] totally fortuitous um you know I I you
[1213.799s] know from the New York area and after
[1215.88s] college worked for a a big us uh mutual
[1219.08s] fund family ended up moving to San
[1221.919s] Francisco in a firm called Barkley&#39;s
[1223.799s] Global Investors which was the largest
[1227.12s] institutional passive an index
[1229.44s] quantitative manager globally was
[1231.64s] starting a thing called ey shares and I
[1234.48s] just had the kind of dumb luck of being
[1237.08s] a part of a small team probably two
[1239.12s] dozen people that uh you know they
[1241.84s] brought in all these very senior kind of
[1243.88s] captains of industry and and little old
[1246.72s] me um it&#39;s very clear it was a startup
[1249.88s] with a kind of a rich uncle that we were
[1251.679s] in a different building than the rest of
[1253.32s] the company so if it didn&#39;t work they
[1254.559s] were just gonna kind of unplug us but it
[1257.12s] turned out to be an incredible
[1259.24s] success um and I had this great learning
[1262.0s] experience of being a younger person
[1263.4s] being a sponge and just wanting to learn
[1266.48s] you know you had you know the former
[1269.2s] head of marketing from a very large US
[1271.24s] fund family you had the head of trading
[1273.32s] head of portfolio
[1274.679s] management the head of sales heads of
[1277.08s] marketing you know I&#39;m in this little
[1278.919s] room with all these incredible people um
[1282.08s] so you know learn the ETF industry
[1284.32s] through and through uh ultimately our
[1286.559s] parent Barkley&#39;s Bank ran into some
[1288.799s] problems in the financial crisis uh sold
[1292.6s] uh I shares and bgi to to Black Rock and
[1297.039s] um you know I&#39;m from New York so uh I&#39;d
[1299.76s] come back and just walked up the street
[1302.64s] you know with my box to uh to Black Rock
[1305.2s] worked for them for a few years great
[1307.039s] great company uh incredibly successful
[1309.919s] company and uh but wanted to do
[1311.88s] something more entrepreneural so
[1313.24s] happened to meet John Crane who American
[1315.48s] who had lived in China built a
[1317.12s] successful business geared to China&#39;s
[1319.96s] growing Urban middle class but wanted to
[1322.64s] take what he did in the retail retail
[1324.84s] space apply it to finance and he was
[1327.4s] looking for someone to help build the
[1329.24s] company and I was like hey if you want
[1330.799s] to build an ETF firm I I I can help do
[1333.48s] that wow uh so you know really back uh
[1336.919s] quit my job in the beginning of 2013 and
[1340.159s] you know there&#39;s really just a handful
[1341.679s] of us zero clients zero assets zero
[1345.52s] brand uh started started the company
[1348.12s] from nothing really based on John&#39;s
[1350.4s] vision and gumption and um you know so
[1353.76s] my job was to help make that vision
[1355.24s] investable and that big part of that was
[1358.08s] launching uh you know kweb our China
[1361.159s] internet ETF uh uh but also really
[1364.12s] trying to provide a balanced perspective
[1366.0s] on China&#39;s economy and capital markets
[1368.08s] so U that that&#39;s a big part of what we
[1370.2s] aim to do and obviously we&#39;ve done more
[1371.72s] things besides China climate and a few
[1374.32s] other things uh um but really my my
[1378.64s] day-to-day focus is is on the China
[1380.72s] China investment business so your timing
[1383.679s] was impeccable for a number of reasons
[1385.96s] one you basically got in on the
[1388.12s] beginning of the ETF wave at granted we
[1391.039s] had the qes and we had the spiders but
[1393.6s] really you were ahead of the crowd and
[1395.799s] you picked a niche which uh which had an
[1399.159s] incredible run and you know one of the
[1401.48s] things that I was looking over the
[1403.2s] hangsang as I was uh getting ready for
[1406.08s] this call and it&#39;s it&#39;s almost symmetric
[1409.32s] pretty much every two to four years
[1411.76s] China has these you know abysmal crashes
[1415.159s] followed by parabolic rallies and and
[1417.72s] here we are uh effectively two years
[1420.679s] into an abysmal crash uh in China and uh
[1425.08s] you can&#39;t convince anyone that there&#39;s
[1427.32s] any green shoot or any light at the end
[1429.88s] of the tunnel This Time It&#39;s Different
[1432.679s] uh you&#39;ve been doing this for a number
[1434.08s] of years over over a decade now in China
[1437.159s] uh how is this different or how is it
[1439.08s] actually the
[1440.44s] same I I I don&#39;t think it&#39;s different
[1443.44s] you know we we like to your brains are
[1447.039s] kind of wired I&#39;m I&#39;m into behavioral
[1449.08s] finance and uh our brains are wired to
[1452.039s] find easy solutions to complex problems
[1454.96s] like the stock market um and I think I
[1457.72s] think if you if you step back big
[1460.679s] picture um you know from
[1462.88s] 19 I ran these numbers just now I um you
[1466.48s] know if you go back and look at you know
[1469.12s] there&#39;s a time period from you know
[1472.919s] basically the end of
[1474.399s] 1999 through the end of 2009 you know us
[1478.52s] equities had a negative negative return
[1482.039s] wow non non us
[1484.44s] equities vastly outperformed
[1487.32s] particularly Emerging Markets
[1489.159s] particularly China um over that 10year
[1492.559s] time period and um that I think you know
[1495.96s] one this abysmal Market the
[1499.399s] US uh where people gave up on us
[1502.48s] equities during the financial crisis
[1504.52s] because that was the second 50% draw
[1506.76s] down that was the foundation for this
[1509.159s] bull market and so you know in in the
[1512.44s] 2000s you had non us equities
[1514.799s] particularly em and China um and then
[1518.0s] and then it kind of flipped right when
[1519.6s] people were least prepared for it we&#39;ve
[1521.84s] gone backwards where now the S&amp;P 500
[1525.88s] from the GFC low is up over a
[1529.679s] th% non us equities aren&#39;t even up a
[1533.12s] third so all country world xus is not
[1536.12s] even up 300% it&#39;s up
[1539.12s] 280 em is not even up 250 China&#39;s not
[1542.96s] even up uh
[1545.6s] 150 um and so people say hey like you
[1548.399s] know this is American exceptionalism but
[1551.279s] but you you forgot about the decade
[1553.52s] before and what if the next decade it
[1556.44s] flip-flops again I and and the one
[1559.36s] factor I&#39;ve been following Tom um is the
[1562.559s] is the dollar yeah that the US dollar
[1566.0s] was uh you know went from being in those
[1570.32s] 2000s deae gating so non you know non
[1574.919s] non dooll denominated assets pre you
[1577.52s] know to flip-flopping we&#39;ve had this
[1579.36s] incredible bull market just using uh the
[1584.24s] dxy um you know as a proxy the US dollar
[1588.72s] actually from its its bottom in April of
[1592.36s] 2011 actually went up uh just about
[1596.64s] 56% the the Dollar&#39;s actually come off
[1600.039s] it&#39;s U its highs in 2022 but but if you
[1604.08s] think about a 50% return over you know
[1607.679s] you know call it you know basically uh
[1610.12s] 11 years you know this is yeah this is
[1613.919s] like a three a 3% Tailwind US Stock STS
[1619.159s] get every year versus non US dollar
[1622.36s] denominated so so so there&#39;s actually
[1624.919s] some signs that the dollar is weakening
[1627.44s] and you know you know we don&#39;t have to
[1629.52s] go into you know us deficits 34 trillion
[1633.919s] and uh uh you know maybe you know the
[1636.6s] election and all that but but you&#39;d say
[1638.399s] there&#39;s not a lot of fiscal
[1640.159s] responsibility in in Washington DC and
[1643.52s] yeah you there&#39;s an argument that dollar
[1645.48s] is starting to reflect that and if you
[1647.12s] believe not you know the FED cuts and to
[1649.76s] what extent you know that would be you
[1651.24s] know uh a negative for the dollar so so
[1654.0s] anyway I&#39;m just saying that you can kind
[1656.2s] of see some of this regime change
[1659.2s] potentially taking place just in terms
[1661.48s] of US versus non- us and certainly China
[1664.6s] you know China has had some real issues
[1666.76s] I&#39;m not not saying China&#39;s it&#39;s all
[1669.12s] rainbow and unicorns over there it&#39;s
[1671.36s] it&#39;s it&#39;s not um at the same time the
[1674.44s] Western media narrative I don&#39;t think is
[1677.48s] necessarily
[1678.64s] um fair and balance let&#39;s put it that
[1681.159s] way yeah I agree you know it&#39;s funny in
[1683.279s] the podcast one of the periods we
[1685.2s] continue to reference as an analog is
[1688.399s] the 2001 to 2007 period and you had a
[1692.12s] lot of similar conditions that you know
[1694.32s] Tech got overvalued as a percentage of
[1696.32s] the S&amp;P uh the earnings Etc the dollar
[1699.6s] actually was super strong in 99 2000
[1702.08s] then it rolled over as it rolled over
[1704.559s] you saw emerging markets in China have
[1706.84s] it&#39;s its most historic Rally from 2003
[1710.32s] to 2007 uh commodity started to move
[1713.679s] with the weak dollar uh the the whole
[1716.12s] story and if you look back it&#39;s
[1717.919s] interesting you said about flipflop
[1719.64s] flopping decades back and forth because
[1721.44s] in the 80s emerging markets and
[1723.559s] international did extremely well and
[1725.64s] then 90s you had this uh outperformance
[1728.48s] and if you look at kind of the US
[1730.799s] narrative uh of late decelerating
[1734.24s] earnings growth for the mag 7
[1736.6s] accelerating earnings grow grow for the
[1739.64s] unmagnify the good news is you can make
[1741.88s] a tremendous amount of money in the 493
[1744.559s] that have lagged where you can find
[1746.159s] Value and you&#39;re seeing activists go
[1747.64s] into you know Starbucks and maybe not
[1750.44s] Lulu yet but I&#39;m sure there you know
[1752.84s] Disney all these value stocks that are
[1755.2s] not going anywhere um but with the
[1758.84s] weakening dollar whether it&#39;s due to
[1761.279s] deficits whether it&#39;s due to uh fed
[1763.919s] policy uh Etc historically you you you
[1768.159s] have to look very hard to find an
[1769.72s] environment where the dollar weakens and
[1772.159s] emerging markets in China don&#39;t do well
[1775.32s] um having been through Cycles you know
[1777.48s] you had these big draw Downs obviously
[1780.159s] 2009 2011 right before you guys got
[1783.88s] started uh
[1787.159s] 20156
[1788.679s] 2019 Etc you you know over and over and
[1792.72s] then obviously the the the only one that
[1795.0s] replicated what we&#39;re seeing right now
[1797.2s] in terms of Max magnitude besides 2009
[1800.48s] was that 2001 to 2003 can can you give
[1805.08s] maybe your probably most recent
[1807.76s] recollection is that uh
[1812.08s] 20156 kind of what was going on there
[1814.6s] what was sentiment what was unemployment
[1817.279s] like uh uh policy prescriptives and how
[1820.72s] they similar or different to maybe what
[1823.12s] we&#39;re seeing right now and how you think
[1826.48s] about lights at the end of the tunnel or
[1828.76s] it&#39;s it&#39;s just too hard to discern and
[1830.519s] you just got to hang in there with low
[1831.96s] valuations until something clicks yeah
[1834.96s] that that was an interesting time period
[1837.6s] because you had a uh you China&#39;s economy
[1841.48s] was doing well I mean some of the
[1843.2s] western media that there was ghost
[1845.12s] cities and Shadow banking uh but but in
[1849.08s] China know and believe that if if
[1852.039s] anything um the preceding time period
[1855.279s] was an incredible bull Market
[1859.6s] particularly in uh mainland China so so
[1862.919s] one one important thing is that we
[1865.279s] always differentiate between mainland
[1868.0s] China the Chinese Asia so Shanghai Shen
[1870.76s] Zen stocks
[1872.639s] predominantly only owned by investors in
[1876.679s] China and compare that with Hong Kong
[1879.48s] and us adrs which are predominantly
[1882.44s] owned by Foreign
[1884.84s] investors um and the mainland went
[1888.24s] through a huge bull market really driven
[1891.44s] by uh margin driven debth MH and that
[1896.279s] Bubble Burst and and when the bubble
[1899.36s] burst in the mainland Market uh that
[1902.48s] market you know June July August of 2015
[1906.279s] I&#39;ve never seen any I mean that market
[1907.6s] went down for three months almost
[1911.519s] consecutively and and it it took out
[1914.279s] kind of the even though the the offshore
[1917.039s] Market had none of this debt
[1919.24s] driven U it kind of the perception and
[1922.36s] then you had the Chinese devaluation of
[1925.32s] the currency which again you know you&#39;d
[1928.76s] say I mean and this is what&#39;s kind of
[1930.36s] interesting is you&#39;d say well what&#39;s you
[1932.399s] know China devalued its currency by you
[1934.159s] know it was like 1% or two percent but
[1937.44s] just as we saw a few weeks ago with the
[1939.24s] Yen
[1941.24s] de okay if you&#39;re a normal investor you
[1944.519s] know you&#39;re not using leverage you if
[1947.2s] you&#39;re lever 10 to one 100 to one a
[1952.08s] thousand to one yeah even what we just
[1954.72s] saw with the Yen de you know this that
[1957.799s] Yen carry trade
[1959.96s] unwind uh just shows you know the people
[1963.0s] that are really levered up I mean
[1965.799s] they&#39;re getting carried out feet first
[1968.6s] and even though China didn&#39;t devalue the
[1970.919s] currency which is you know was kind of a
[1973.12s] currency adjustment I would argue more
[1974.799s] than a outright
[1976.519s] Deval um it&#39;s took out highly levered
[1980.24s] players and uh the knock on effect
[1983.639s] rippled through through the global
[1985.48s] markets and it was you know like like
[1987.279s] the Yen yeah it was shortlived so so it
[1990.919s] wasn&#39;t that was not really an economic
[1993.36s] Malay was just it was actually the
[1995.559s] almost the opposite of what we&#39;re seeing
[1997.44s] today you know today you couldn&#39;t give
[1999.799s] the shares of China away on the street
[2002.88s] you know no one be like you know you
[2004.519s] know please you know take it away yeah
[2007.279s] and and some of this I would argue it&#39;s
[2009.639s] just if you think about if you think
[2013.639s] about you know 15 years you that 15
[2018.639s] years is we&#39;re talking about 60
[2022.32s] quarterly you know times you open up
[2024.679s] your you know brokerage statement um or
[2028.039s] your investment committee meets or your
[2030.24s] board meets or your
[2032.2s] trust I mean it&#39;s really hard and this
[2035.919s] isn&#39;t in China or
[2038.24s] but but really non us
[2040.519s] equities is is it&#39;s really really I mean
[2044.88s] you get on you know as a professional
[2046.88s] investor you g under a lot of pressure
[2050.04s] hey why do you own this stuff that
[2052.44s] always is a drag and you start whittling
[2056.359s] it down and all of a sudden it&#39;s gone
[2059.879s] and and I think I think you know you
[2061.879s] know my little joke is you know
[2062.96s] unfortunately Harry Martz passed away uh
[2066.159s] not too long ago but but verification
[2068.24s] has died for many investors I mean
[2070.159s] there&#39;s one game in town it&#39;s us
[2072.879s] equities and then I would argue you know
[2076.399s] yeah there&#39;s a few pockets asml in the
[2078.919s] Netherlands or TSD in Taiwan or Samsung
[2082.679s] in South Korea but you almost got to
[2084.639s] cherry pick these individual names or
[2087.72s] these little markets but it&#39;s there&#39;s
[2090.04s] one game in town in US equities and you
[2092.52s] know that bredth is even narrow you know
[2094.8s] to kind of the mag seven and it&#39;s a GL
[2097.72s] Global phen it&#39;s not just us investors
[2100.079s] it&#39;s a global phenomenon in my opinion
[2102.8s] yeah yeah until it changes and and you
[2105.839s] know one could say that the US
[2109.68s] exceptional was certainly Justified
[2112.48s] because the earnings power supported it
[2115.599s] okay uh but now with the capex
[2117.839s] investment margins are coming down and
[2120.44s] they have to do it because if they&#39;re
[2121.88s] not that&#39;s their game the digital game
[2124.24s] so uh with margins decelerating and and
[2127.88s] the dollar weakening the other thing
[2129.48s] that you said about uh Chinese Deval on
[2132.44s] their currency the other thing that we
[2135.16s] focused on on the podcast historically
[2137.4s] is that we need to see bond yields go up
[2142.16s] in China and we need to see the currency
[2144.56s] start to appreciate in China and just as
[2147.359s] they on on a dime could devalue their
[2150.599s] currency do you think we could see
[2152.2s] strength in there now they might be
[2154.96s] holding back on the basis of well if if
[2158.359s] Trump&#39;s come trump it doesn&#39;t matter
[2160.44s] Trump or Cala they&#39;ve both been tough on
[2162.16s] China yeah uh comes in and wants to do
[2165.68s] huge tariffs you know we&#39;re going to
[2167.56s] devalue to just offset the the tariffs
[2170.24s] so you you can do all you want we&#39;ll
[2171.8s] just cut our prices by using our
[2173.96s] currency um so so tariffs are not going
[2176.44s] to be terribly effective against China
[2178.48s] as a matter of fact I read something
[2180.48s] that if they did a 60% tariff on China
[2183.599s] it would affect Chinese GDP by two
[2185.88s] percentage points so effectively go from
[2188.0s] 5% to 3% which is still faster than the
[2190.48s] US so it doesn&#39;t really serve anyone
[2192.52s] because we don&#39;t have uh any any willing
[2195.24s] workers to go into uh uh you know the to
[2200.28s] to go into factories and and deliver the
[2202.119s] type of stuff that we need yeah yeah
[2204.68s] Diplomat we&#39;re definitely skeptical of
[2207.079s] the uh you know let&#39;s bring back
[2209.119s] pollution and and let&#39;s destroy the
[2212.16s] environment and you know if you want to
[2214.4s] bring it back then volunteer to have a
[2216.2s] rare earth process and Factory in your
[2219.16s] in your town and there&#39;s just there&#39;s
[2220.92s] just no way I mean you know we rich
[2223.16s] people Outsource our pollution to these
[2225.44s] poor people if it&#39;s Emerging Markets if
[2228.079s] it&#39;s if it&#39;s China or India or
[2229.92s] Bangladesh and yeah I mean we&#39;re very
[2232.24s] skeptical you know we think some of the
[2233.92s] Tariff rhetoric is this is the art of
[2236.4s] the deal and if you think 60% tariffs
[2239.28s] are you should short Walmart and Costco
[2242.24s] and home
[2243.96s] Apple yeah I mean and and yeah I mean
[2247.079s] you know just unfortunately you know the
[2249.599s] you know some of the data gets lost in
[2251.88s] some of the political hyperbole but but
[2254.76s] you know we don&#39;t we think it&#39;s you know
[2257.079s] re you resurrecting Smoot and Holly is
[2259.72s] is not a very good idea for any
[2261.48s] political leader and so we&#39;re very
[2263.119s] skeptical of some of the the Tariff
[2265.04s] rhetoric and by the way as it relates to
[2268.56s] Japan I I think yes it&#39;s over and I
[2271.76s] think it&#39;s it&#39;s more couched than over
[2274.56s] because effectively the J Japanese trade
[2277.48s] it&#39;s not based on true underlying
[2279.16s] fundamentals or demographics if anything
[2281.16s] it&#39;s just the opposite what it was is we
[2283.64s] have to have Asia exposure we&#39;re not
[2285.48s] willing to have China where do we go we
[2287.24s] go to India and we go to Japan now the
[2290.44s] fact of the matter is is they&#39;ve got
[2292.839s] inflation now and they have to hike they
[2295.319s] hiked the FED didn&#39;t hike on that same
[2297.76s] day you had a liquidity mismatch and you
[2300.96s] saw what happens how levered it is and
[2302.839s] the Mitch Match the only reason it&#39;s
[2304.64s] quote unquote over is because the boj
[2306.839s] came out and said our bad we&#39;re going
[2309.24s] back but they still have to move in that
[2311.48s] direction they just have to wait for the
[2312.92s] Fed so the FED 100% has to go in
[2315.64s] September because J Japan was the global
[2318.8s] liquidity provider for the West for two
[2320.8s] plus years while we were fighting
[2322.079s] inflation buying bonds buying equities
[2324.119s] printing money now they need our help we
[2326.48s] didn&#39;t come to their rescue in August we
[2328.56s] dropped the ball uh Howell maybe
[2331.0s] underestimated the impact of the
[2333.04s] leverage uh but now in September I think
[2336.079s] the FED goes Cuts I think you&#39;re going
[2338.52s] to see boj shortly thereafter hike
[2340.8s] because they don&#39;t want to you know let
[2342.16s] inflation out a spiral out of control
[2344.0s] that&#39;s going to slowly let the air out
[2346.079s] of the carry trade that money&#39;s got to
[2347.52s] go somewhere in Asia India&#39;s
[2350.0s] overvalued uh China is going to go back
[2352.599s] to in in our view um yeah yeah I I agree
[2358.2s] 100 perc I mean I think a lot of the
[2359.68s] money in Japan and and India came out of
[2362.8s] out of China I think a lot a lot of
[2365.56s] money you know from Asia&#39;s gone into mag
[2368.96s] s yeah and and I think as the FED Cuts
[2373.64s] you know that that dollar weakness it&#39;s
[2376.319s] really going to weigh on these Asian
[2378.24s] investors particularly you know in the
[2380.24s] EM world you know those those em central
[2382.96s] banks are raising rates you know you
[2385.359s] know around China we see uh See you know
[2388.839s] them wanting to ease but but you know
[2391.64s] they&#39;ve not wanted to depre you know
[2393.48s] every time the currency deap reci they
[2395.44s] get labeled a currency manipulator
[2397.92s] so they&#39;re very hesitant to to allow
[2400.52s] that but they&#39;ll the pboc will wait wait
[2404.76s] for the FED to cut and likely follow
[2407.0s] suit they&#39;ve been uh they&#39;ve they&#39;ve you
[2409.92s] they&#39;ve cut different intra Bank lending
[2412.2s] rates and the loan prime rate and bank
[2414.64s] reserve rate but they&#39;ve really not cut
[2416.64s] broad interest because they&#39;re worried
[2418.0s] about the currency effect and and and a
[2421.2s] lot of things you mentioned you know
[2423.44s] China&#39;s the Chinese government&#39;s been
[2425.359s] very worried about strong fiscal
[2427.52s] stimulus because of the creating more
[2429.96s] debt in China and we&#39;re starting to see
[2432.64s] a little bit of a change in tune there
[2435.8s] um it&#39;s it&#39;s slow you know they&#39;ve not
[2438.28s] wanted to do you know free checks in the
[2440.839s] mail modern monetary Theory as we did
[2443.8s] here because of the effect on debt and
[2445.56s] inflation so so they&#39;re being much more
[2448.4s] prudent or conservative on fiscal
[2451.44s] stimulus but but you know we would say
[2453.68s] there&#39;s signs it&#39;s coming and you&#39;re
[2455.68s] seeing it in the e and the home
[2458.16s] appliance space But even just very
[2460.88s] recently uh the Premier Premier Lee
[2464.16s] spoke about uh supporting domestic
[2467.24s] consumption more so so I think they&#39;re
[2469.92s] realizing that okay if the US is cutting
[2472.72s] rates it&#39;s because the US economy now
[2474.76s] whether or not it&#39;s headed to recession
[2476.64s] is slowing and that that&#39;s going to be a
[2479.359s] problem for export driven manufacturers
[2482.04s] like Japan like China and so to they&#39;re
[2486.319s] going to have to raise domestic
[2488.2s] consumption to offset the coming
[2490.76s] weakness in exports and and I think
[2493.88s] that&#39;s why you&#39;re seeing this slow slow
[2496.96s] pivot me there are other facets to of
[2500.64s] why China&#39;s economy has been rather
[2502.52s] tepid if it&#39;s the housing crisis and the
[2504.96s] effect on the consumer the scar tissue
[2507.68s] of zero covid but but they&#39;re actually
[2510.92s] you we seeing these little talk of
[2513.0s] consumer
[2514.319s] vouchers start so and and I think think
[2517.4s] I think that&#39;s where
[2518.72s] Alibaba you which really um was really
[2522.96s] well you know John Crane showed me this
[2524.76s] picture of jackm 2012 and was like you
[2527.839s] know The Whole World&#39;s Gonna know who
[2529.52s] this guy is I was like who is it you
[2531.44s] know and uh he&#39;s like this company&#39;s
[2533.92s] going to go public and it&#39;s going to
[2535.24s] change the world of investing and and to
[2537.599s] his credit he was you know John&#39;s Vision
[2539.52s] came to fruition but but Alibaba is
[2542.0s] really uh the transmission engine for
[2545.44s] domestic consumption in China and
[2548.2s] there&#39;s other players you know pindu Duo
[2551.079s] Tick Tock um you know bite dance in
[2553.88s] China JD but but but Alibaba is um you
[2559.2s] know um very well-run company and uh you
[2563.64s] know they&#39;re uh having had a dinner with
[2565.92s] them I guess it&#39;s been about two months
[2567.599s] in h two months ago in Hong Kong and uh
[2571.359s] that you know I came away you know very
[2573.0s] confident in um the you know management
[2576.64s] leadership
[2577.68s] and uh you know their vision for you
[2581.68s] know things improving you know they&#39;ve
[2583.28s] obviously been adversely
[2585.28s] affected by the tepid economic growth
[2588.48s] particularly around domestic consumption
[2590.079s] but but I think there&#39;s there is a light
[2591.839s] at the end of the tunnel and um there&#39;s
[2594.359s] a lot there&#39;s a lot that they&#39;re doing
[2595.839s] to try to change that as well from a
[2598.319s] management perspective yeah yeah it
[2600.839s] seems like they you know at first they
[2602.24s] had the breakup because they wanted to
[2603.839s] say look the sum of our parts is greater
[2605.48s] than the whole but it was a bad
[2606.68s] environment for the IPL the other thing
[2608.52s] I wanted to quickly ask on the on the
[2610.2s] policy you know it&#39;s been this slow drip
[2612.28s] for 12 months every week they are doing
[2615.24s] some level of Mini stimulus mini support
[2618.839s] do you get a sense that they&#39;re building
[2620.88s] or they&#39;re just not enough like they
[2622.4s] just need they they need a Hard Punch or
[2624.839s] or it&#39;s going to get momentum because
[2626.319s] it&#39;s compounding all these little things
[2627.92s] that they&#39;ve been doing these mini Cuts
[2630.04s] there manyi stimulative things over the
[2632.119s] last 12 months any sense that uh we&#39;re
[2636.24s] going to see a atic effect from that
[2638.8s] yeah I mean the you know president G and
[2641.319s] the top 200 leaders in China got
[2644.96s] together at this thing about a month ago
[2646.64s] called the third plenum and uh the third
[2649.359s] plenum doesn&#39;t dictate policy but it but
[2652.76s] it sets the direction and the main
[2656.0s] takeaway from the release that came out
[2658.52s] of it was it was a
[2661.28s] clear acknowledgment that the economy is
[2664.599s] not doing great I mean that that I think
[2667.4s] the market was like oh there was no
[2668.92s] policy at but that&#39;s not what that&#39;s not
[2670.76s] what they that&#39;s not what they do you
[2672.28s] know China&#39;s a
[2673.4s] bureaucracy and the message gets
[2675.44s] filtered down to these different
[2677.92s] agencies that then push push it down and
[2681.76s] the you know the biggest worry is always
[2684.72s] policy error and and and you know from
[2688.079s] the government and and and the the
[2690.839s] exhale I had was like okay yeah these
[2693.359s] guys didn&#39;t they didn&#39;t put lipstick on
[2695.319s] it they they they knowledge there is a
[2698.48s] problem and the question then is what
[2700.76s] are they going to do about it and and I
[2703.76s] think you know people will say well why
[2705.319s] would they care about the economy or
[2708.119s] every government cares about the economy
[2710.48s] yeah because you know political regime
[2713.599s] change takes place during financial
[2717.16s] crisis I mean I mentioned you Smoot
[2719.72s] Senator Smoot and Senator Holly just
[2722.599s] like President Hoover did not get
[2724.52s] reelected in 1932 right you know
[2727.72s] no different than Boris Johnson or you
[2730.2s] could actually say you know president
[2731.92s] Trump you know because of Co the US econ
[2734.76s] so so and China is no different you know
[2738.0s] China is not immune to this and so the
[2741.68s] acknowledgment and and you&#39;re starting
[2743.92s] to see the super tanker doesn&#39;t doesn&#39;t
[2747.48s] you know pivot on a dime but so I just
[2750.76s] say you&#39;re seeing a a change in the tone
[2754.079s] and tenor from what&#39;s coming out of the
[2757.24s] government and they&#39;re actually being
[2759.599s] more vocal and I I think the key Tom is
[2762.8s] you know there&#39;s there&#39;s a
[2765.119s] barometer which is that Chinese ashare
[2768.28s] market now the Shanghai Shen xan that
[2772.079s] market is not doing great and that that
[2776.119s] is a vote of no confidence from the
[2779.24s] Chinese people on what the government&#39;s
[2782.96s] done so far now now that doesn&#39;t affect
[2786.079s] us because you know you know the the
[2788.599s] internet names the grow stocks they tend
[2791.319s] to list outside of China predominant
[2794.16s] because they were funded by us private
[2795.92s] Equity yeah no different than bite
[2797.72s] dances owned by Americans I mean I just
[2801.16s] you know this Chinese company it&#39;s owned
[2803.559s] by Americans stop stop saying that just
[2806.559s] stop saying but but you know most of the
[2808.96s] companies we hold in kweb you know
[2811.079s] Alibaba was funded by Silver Lake right
[2813.8s] and seoa and you know mo and so those
[2817.16s] companies the the venture capitalist and
[2819.88s] private Equity investor they wanted a US
[2822.359s] dollar exit yeah and that&#39;s why they
[2825.04s] listed here in the United States or you
[2827.44s] know even 10 cent is actually listed in
[2830.48s] in Hong Kong and that was to maximize
[2833.28s] value right go to the biggest Market
[2835.079s] possible yeah so uh let&#39;s shift gears
[2838.24s] one of the things we always say we don&#39;t
[2839.68s] like to take C country and Company risk
[2843.96s] at the same time it&#39;s part of the reason
[2845.48s] we&#39;ve expressed um our um our position
[2851.0s] through
[2852.079s] Alibaba
[2854.04s] and I want to talk about the earnings
[2857.0s] here first and
[2859.16s] foremost we have uh something coming up
[2863.48s] in August 22nd where we&#39;re going to have
[2866.04s] the vote to have the Dual primary
[2868.359s] listing uh and then if that&#39;s approved
[2870.92s] which it appears that it will then
[2872.559s] September 9th we go live uh in Hong Kong
[2877.76s] supposedly so it&#39;s estimated if you look
[2880.96s] at 10 cent if you look at uh Alibaba if
[2884.68s] you look at mwan mwan when it when it
[2886.8s] did the Dual primary listing in 2019 it
[2889.04s] was up 17% in the first month some of
[2891.119s] the others not as much because they were
[2892.319s] in Weak markets uh it&#39;s expected that up
[2895.16s] to 10 to 15% of the market cap could
[2898.559s] come from China buyers over time so
[2900.599s] you&#39;re looking at 20 to30 billion
[2903.319s] dollars of buying power coming in over
[2905.28s] the next 9 to 12 months uh can you speak
[2908.96s] to that and the implications you think
[2911.319s] that might have yeah yeah I think this
[2913.319s] is um you this is this is a big Catalyst
[2916.76s] for the company that&#39;s southbound uh
[2919.96s] stock connect is a
[2922.0s] program there&#39;s Northbound which allows
[2924.52s] foreign
[2925.52s] investors like like you know at at crane
[2928.119s] shares we do invest not in KW but in
[2930.52s] other strategies in the Chinese a share
[2933.0s] market and allows a foreign investor to
[2935.799s] go through the Hong Kong Stock Exchange
[2937.52s] and by Shanghai shenzen stocks and the
[2940.44s] reverse is true with southbound stock
[2942.559s] connect which allows institutional and
[2946.04s] uh High net worth investors in China to
[2949.04s] invest in Hong Kong stocks but it&#39;s not
[2952.64s] all Hong Kong stocks that have to be
[2954.599s] Hong Kong eligible and one of the
[2957.04s] requirement there&#39;s there&#39;s been various
[2961.4s] requirements um and you some of those
[2965.119s] rules have changed over time
[2967.4s] relaxed um but if you&#39;re primary listed
[2971.44s] outside of Hong Kong you you&#39;re not
[2973.799s] connect eligible okay and so Alibaba the
[2978.04s] shareholders will vote you know to make
[2980.079s] its dual primary which would make it um
[2984.4s] southbound connect eligible and I&#39;ve
[2986.76s] actually been I&#39;ve I&#39;ve made some phone
[2989.44s] calls um you know you know between us to
[2993.839s] Alibaba to the Hong Kong stock what is
[2996.44s] the exact date and and and I think
[3000.44s] people being very Koy on what is the
[3002.88s] exact date so I you know the the
[3006.16s] September 9th you know you know we&#39;ve
[3008.4s] talked about and and you know I&#39;ve seen
[3011.04s] some people kind of backtracking you
[3012.48s] know some people saying hey maybe that
[3013.92s] you know maybe it could be sooner you
[3015.359s] know maybe it&#39;ll be a little later so so
[3017.559s] but but but the key is it&#39;s coming and
[3019.72s] just to your point time you know you
[3021.72s] know how do we know what&#39;s coming well
[3024.359s] you know we did some comparisons you
[3026.16s] know you know 10
[3027.799s] cent which um has about about a billion
[3032.0s] user just over a billion users of we
[3035.16s] chat uh it&#39;s you know China&#39;s Facebook
[3038.079s] and you know Alibaba the two main
[3041.559s] Ecommerce uh Tau and Teo have about 900
[3044.68s] million
[3045.839s] users uh so you could say well what are
[3048.52s] the number of users or we could look at
[3050.92s] the number of shares or the percentage
[3053.799s] of market cap so about 10% % of 10 cents
[3058.52s] call it 400 billion in market cap is
[3061.96s] held so so you&#39;d say okay about 40
[3064.28s] billion could go into
[3066.2s] Alibaba um but you could say well
[3068.92s] alibaba&#39;s you know only about 200
[3071.4s] billion so 10% you know so so you know
[3075.16s] we don&#39;t we don&#39;t know exactly how much
[3077.04s] will come in it won&#39;t come in day one
[3079.04s] but you&#39;re talking about 20 to 40
[3081.88s] billion yeah uh coming in I mean I mean
[3084.52s] this is a real number I mean this is a
[3086.359s] real real Catalyst and um you know you
[3090.839s] know I kind of D say like you know
[3093.119s] imagine not being own able to own Amazon
[3096.839s] yeah uh you know you use it every day
[3100.0s] and know you know you&#39;re you know I you
[3102.839s] know it&#39;s like you&#39;re gonna go Coco for
[3104.319s] Cocoa Puffs like you&#39;re GNA say I can
[3107.079s] buy the you know finally right you know
[3109.96s] this company went public back in 2014 so
[3113.64s] so anyway so um yeah we think we see it
[3116.76s] major Catalyst um and and there&#39;s
[3119.559s] there&#39;s there&#39;s other things that I
[3121.839s] think are going in Alibaba from you know
[3124.559s] some of the
[3125.68s] macro um you know there&#39;s been some
[3127.68s] fundamental reasons why alibaba&#39;s
[3129.88s] struggled just uh domestic consumption
[3132.64s] increased competition but you know to me
[3135.559s] to me you know ultimately Alibaba buying
[3138.88s] back stock you know they&#39;re opening up a
[3141.4s] brand new
[3142.799s] headquarters you know yet those are not
[3145.52s] things that company that are facing
[3148.24s] severe hardship due right you know you
[3152.04s] hoard cash you know you don&#39;t you don&#39;t
[3155.68s] build a new
[3157.2s] campus uh but you know if you are a
[3160.88s] company owned by the
[3162.76s] founders you know if you have those same
[3164.92s] entrepreneurs who started it whose net
[3167.16s] worth is in the same stock as as us
[3170.92s] those are the things you do you buy back
[3173.079s] stock hand over fist and you build a new
[3175.799s] headquarters you&#39;re like okay things are
[3177.52s] going to get better not worse in the
[3180.76s] future yeah in my yeah no question about
[3184.2s] it the the second thing is um when they
[3188.48s] are on the uh dual listing in Hong Kong
[3193.599s] will they be able to buy back stock
[3197.839s] through the southbound connect without
[3200.0s] issuing preferreds or are they still
[3202.52s] going to have to issue preferreds to get
[3204.4s] cash uh out to do the buyback because
[3207.359s] because uh that could be another major
[3209.72s] Catalyst that&#39;s limited their although
[3211.559s] they&#39;ve been buying back and issuing
[3213.599s] preferreds at very favorable rates it&#39;s
[3216.04s] limited their ability to do what they&#39;re
[3218.319s] able to do uh or potentially want to do
[3222.0s] without doing preferreds to get outside
[3224.76s] you know cash outside the borders to buy
[3226.359s] back stock that&#39;s been my assumption as
[3229.2s] well that uh you know you know alibaba&#39;s
[3231.76s] revenues are predominantly in rmbi which
[3234.88s] is why they did these uh the convert
[3238.28s] deal um that that you know they don&#39;t
[3241.0s] have a lot of US dollar or Hong Kong
[3244.24s] dollar Revenue so I think you know the
[3246.4s] connect eligibility allows that to go
[3248.119s] through
[3249.119s] southbound uh my assumption and I can
[3251.88s] come back and confirm that um but my
[3255.599s] assumption is it would go through
[3257.44s] southbound wow and therefore you know it
[3261.559s] you they&#39;ve done I mean alibaba&#39;s done
[3264.24s] such a shareholder friendly move of
[3267.16s] capping the you know the convertibility
[3269.16s] to remove the delution I mean this just
[3271.799s] shows this is a you know the company is
[3274.839s] being very shareholder friendly they did
[3277.16s] the first dividend in SE in December of
[3280.599s] last year they&#39;re doing a164 in
[3283.079s] dividends for shareholders this year you
[3285.68s] know this this is a company that&#39;s you
[3288.0s] know you done a lot of shareholder
[3291.0s] friendly it&#39;s just if everyone owns mag
[3294.04s] 7 no one really cares about you know um
[3297.119s] and then and and I would argue you know
[3299.0s] other peers in the space you know the
[3300.92s] buyback yields of companies in the space
[3304.28s] it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s you know it&#39;s just out of
[3307.559s] sight out of mind you know um you know
[3311.04s] there&#39;s there&#39;s other peers in the space
[3313.04s] have gone down a similar route I mean
[3315.68s] I&#39;m um probably showing some of my own
[3318.48s] bias of being uh more of a buyer of
[3321.76s] baskets than individual plays but but
[3324.079s] Alibaba I think uh yeah very very I mean
[3327.319s] that was part of my dinner in Hong Kong
[3329.359s] with uh you know some folks from you
[3332.28s] know senior in the company who&#39;ve been
[3333.72s] there a long time is just uh you know
[3336.559s] they&#39;re very they have a very high
[3338.44s] vested interest in seeing the stock go
[3341.319s] up on a personal basis and um they&#39;re
[3344.52s] doing something about it that was that
[3347.319s] was kind of the the takeaways we&#39;re
[3349.599s] doing something about it and if you know
[3353.079s] you know there was more of this
[3354.44s] disappointment that more you know other
[3355.839s] invest besides you know crane chairs and
[3358.68s] yourself Tom are not picking up on this
[3362.48s] um but I think I think I think you know
[3364.359s] again you know these these regime
[3367.4s] changes from a market leadership don&#39;t
[3369.559s] happen overnight it&#39;s and you know takes
[3372.44s] a little time and i&#39; I&#39;d argue it&#39;s
[3375.559s] there&#39;s some signs of that and I&#39;m not
[3377.28s] rooting for us equities to go down don&#39;t
[3379.119s] get me wrong you know personally I&#39;m
[3381.24s] heavily invested yeah um professionally
[3384.559s] I have no exposure
[3386.64s] um picking up where we left off one of
[3389.359s] the things I was talking about earlier
[3390.96s] was we don&#39;t like to take company and
[3393.0s] Country risk and when we wanted to get
[3395.44s] exposure to a weakening dollar and
[3397.4s] Emerging Markets we saw Alibaba as the
[3400.96s] play to do that number one because it&#39;s
[3403.319s] a national champion I don&#39;t think that&#39;s
[3405.319s] changed much uh and number two in poker
[3409.2s] and I played uh Texas Holden with some
[3411.2s] friends I&#39;ve had the same group for
[3412.839s] about 15 years now in poker you like a
[3415.88s] thing called called outs and what I saw
[3418.119s] in Alibaba was outs in the sense that
[3422.16s] the cloud business is kind of in its
[3424.68s] nent stages if you look at Legacy Cloud
[3427.92s] business digitization of China is
[3429.799s] probably about five years behind the
[3431.28s] digitization of the us and we saw
[3434.039s] Amazon&#39;s big AWS run from 2016 to 2021
[3439.039s] and now we&#39;re shifting into the AI and
[3442.24s] gpus uh W which they&#39;re catching up on
[3445.039s] and then obviously
[3446.799s] you know retailing is a tough business
[3448.319s] as Charlie Munger always says uh we had
[3451.24s] some some market share loss but that&#39;s
[3453.319s] showing signs of stabilization so um so
[3457.2s] I would say two things um for those
[3460.52s] folks that
[3462.72s] um and then the third thing we wanted is
[3465.28s] we wanted the ability to have some
[3466.76s] outperformance so we wanted to be a
[3468.16s] little concentrated if we got the
[3470.24s] company right and we got the country
[3472.48s] right and we got the the thing but for
[3474.319s] those that that are are comfortable with
[3477.24s] just getting brought exposure because
[3478.839s] when it works uh and speaking to what
[3481.359s] you said before you know these things
[3482.559s] don&#39;t happen overnight but what what we
[3484.4s] see if we look back at the last one two
[3488.319s] 3 four five six I&#39;m looking at seven
[3490.92s] huge draw Downs since
[3493.599s] 1994 uh even though they all took a with
[3497.4s] the exception of
[3498.559s] 19898 which that that was just an acute
[3501.359s] situation but most of them took two
[3504.319s] years to build a base but once they
[3506.359s] turned the turn was very abrupt and and
[3509.92s] and abrupt in a way that it almost
[3511.92s] didn&#39;t let anyone in once it started
[3514.319s] going um so yeah they don&#39;t happen
[3517.24s] overnight but one meaning they they&#39;ve
[3520.079s] got to build a couple year base but when
[3522.079s] they turn it&#39;s like night and day so um
[3526.839s] maybe speak to that number one number
[3530.2s] two um if if people don&#39;t want to take
[3534.0s] company risk and you referenced uh
[3536.48s] Alibaba being kind of the toll taker for
[3538.64s] consumption in China uh I know Alibaba
[3541.76s] is one of your top positions in your
[3543.88s] fund uh a how can they get your ETF and
[3547.64s] and B how would that give them broad
[3549.76s] diversification to to when we do get
[3552.16s] that uh abrupt move in in the right
[3555.319s] direction and then opinion starts to
[3556.96s] follow Trend and and they all go up in
[3558.799s] concert
[3560.16s] effectively yeah yeah I mean it&#39;ll be um
[3562.839s] you know again I think I think one of
[3564.2s] the interesting things you know um my
[3566.72s] background kind of on the index
[3568.4s] methodology side is at the end of this
[3570.72s] month is msci&#39;s quarterly rebalance and
[3575.119s] because India&#39;s outperformed China by so
[3578.799s] much within the EM Benchmark that India
[3582.359s] will be about 20% of the EM index and
[3586.64s] China will be about 24% China was
[3590.119s] closing in on 50% of the
[3593.4s] index uh preco so so one you&#39;d said this
[3596.799s] you this incredible Fall From Grace but
[3600.28s] but
[3602.28s] mathematically if you think about India
[3605.0s] at 20% China at 24 well India&#39;s GDP is
[3608.72s] three and a half trillion and China&#39;s 18
[3611.52s] trillion does that make sense to you so
[3614.319s] so the indices themselves have a little
[3616.28s] bit of this momentum effect and you know
[3619.359s] I think I think the you know when you
[3621.64s] have very you know sector
[3624.76s] concentration um sometimes that&#39;s
[3626.599s] ringing the bell and you you saw that in
[3629.4s] the US a few years ago where you know
[3631.28s] the energy stocks were yeah you know
[3634.799s] basically kicked out of all the indices
[3637.64s] and you know then you know energy had so
[3640.16s] so I think I think there&#39;s an
[3641.44s] opportunity for China at this point and
[3645.0s] I think this index rebalance maybe you
[3647.2s] know is the ringing the bell at the top
[3649.16s] on on on the India trade and maybe you
[3652.4s] know may maybe ringing the bottom for
[3654.44s] China because you have some of these
[3656.039s] positive in terms of Economic Policy uh
[3659.72s] but also just the incredible valuation
[3661.64s] of these companies including Ali me one
[3663.88s] time you know stat that that we didn&#39;t
[3666.4s] and I always love to share that I think
[3668.4s] you you and your your shareholders would
[3671.28s] love is that Al Alibaba has very little
[3675.2s] debt but they do have a few US dollar
[3679.72s] bonds and and they have a bond that
[3683.16s] comes due in 2031
[3686.319s] and and obviously interest rates have
[3687.88s] been rising here in the US the last few
[3689.96s] years so that Bond&#39;s lost about
[3692.72s] six% uh in US investment grade
[3696.319s] corporates have lost 7% over the last
[3700.16s] three years but would you believe that
[3703.76s] bond is down 6% and alibaba&#39;s stock is
[3707.4s] down
[3708.64s] 66
[3710.68s] yeah this up by the way it&#39;s almost like
[3714.16s] in the US when a company gets kicked out
[3716.279s] of the Dow they tend to outperform over
[3718.2s] the next 12 to 24 months um it&#39;s funny
[3721.52s] that you brought up the energy trade
[3723.319s] because that&#39;s kind of what put my
[3724.88s] podcast on the map during covid um and
[3728.839s] uh and we had a huge run because we were
[3730.68s] buying xon the highest quality in the
[3734.119s] most dislocated circumstance when when
[3736.559s] oil turned negative and it was like I
[3739.24s] think the waiting got down to 2.5% from
[3742.0s] a peak of 10% and was the exact same
[3744.52s] thing pensions can&#39;t buy it anymore ESG
[3747.96s] you can&#39;t own it blah blah blah until
[3750.24s] the price went up and then opinion
[3752.2s] followed Trend and now these pensions
[3753.96s] can&#39;t get enough energy stocks so um it
[3757.68s] it history really does Rhyme it it it it
[3762.52s] often repeats and that&#39;s why I continue
[3764.4s] to emphasize that scenario in 2001 to
[3768.119s] 2007 because the abrupt move that we&#39;ve
[3770.64s] had in tech stocks in China uh was very
[3774.76s] much like that period and then you had
[3777.559s] the the strengthen dollar go to the
[3778.72s] weaking dollar I do want to shift gear
[3780.799s] by the way so Alibaba in in terms of the
[3784.039s] China Tech index that that&#39;s one of your
[3786.0s] top couple Holdings what percentage
[3787.64s] weight is that in the kweb it&#39;s almost
[3790.24s] 10% wow so that&#39;s that&#39;s a huge position
[3793.599s] how many Holdings do you have overall
[3795.52s] we&#39;ve got 32 um you know we do cap of
[3800.039s] the largest holding at 10% okay that you
[3803.839s] know you know exchange traded funds are
[3805.799s] 40 act mutual fund so the Investment
[3808.24s] Company act 194 so so there are
[3810.319s] diversification rules we have to abide
[3812.64s] by y um and and we rebalance
[3816.119s] semiannually so as stocks go up and down
[3819.119s] you know you can have movement there but
[3821.44s] uh yeah I mean we we were very early you
[3824.24s] know we bought shortly after the IPO
[3827.2s] that&#39;s kind of what helped put us on the
[3828.799s] map was uh we were the kind of the first
[3831.039s] ETF to own Alibaba because we had this
[3833.96s] kind of FastTrack inclusion
[3837.279s] um and then actually we were one of the
[3838.92s] only ETFs at the time that actually
[3840.319s] owned us China adrs that you know most
[3843.799s] China ETFs only held Hong Kong stocks so
[3846.92s] there all these little intricacies to
[3849.16s] indexing and uh that&#39;s kind of again
[3851.68s] that&#39;s kind of my background and
[3852.88s] something I&#39;m into it&#39;s like a cry for
[3854.96s] help but you sleep well at night but um
[3858.72s] yeah on you know popping the hood on
[3860.359s] this stuff really does matter and a lot
[3863.24s] of the arguments against China is like
[3865.52s] oh well the it hasn&#39;t you know the
[3867.799s] hangsang hasn&#39;t done anything in 10
[3870.279s] years or Ms but but you know 10 years
[3873.96s] ago China was the index was 50% two
[3878.4s] sectors financials and energy wow you
[3881.4s] know like like you had you know you had
[3884.359s] no exposure
[3886.52s] to uh the tech sector I mean the tech
[3889.359s] Sector 10 years ago in msci
[3893.44s] China was under 3% of the index yeah but
[3898.119s] that 3% actually outperforms the S&amp;P 500
[3903.24s] over the same time period even even
[3905.4s] though the Benchmark in the aggregate so
[3908.2s] so that&#39;s where we kind of say like you
[3909.92s] we wanted to kind of pull out I call it
[3912.039s] like the good stuff yeah these grow
[3914.48s] companies you know the value energy
[3917.96s] financials Industrials materials real
[3920.2s] estate those are slower low growth
[3922.079s] sectors and yeah you you know that was
[3924.48s] kind of the point of John cr&#39;s Vision in
[3926.48s] creating crane shares is hey like give
[3928.839s] give people the ability to segment out
[3930.96s] these more growth companies but you got
[3933.119s] to go in and get them because you
[3935.68s] particularly you know when we started
[3937.96s] you know uh you know 11 years ago there
[3940.279s] was you know there was you know no no
[3942.96s] exposure in the broad Benchmark so um
[3945.92s] that&#39;s kind of the you know one of the
[3947.279s] key points about crane then and then
[3949.52s] providing people with the data you know
[3951.24s] that every day I wake up and I turn on
[3953.52s] the you know Financial TV or
[3956.16s] you know read the local finance and you
[3958.4s] know you&#39;d think the world was ending in
[3960.559s] China and you know again you know when
[3963.64s] you go there it&#39;s it&#39;s very different
[3965.68s] and um you know streets are crowded the
[3968.16s] traffic&#39;s terrible restaurants are
[3969.96s] crowded you know yes there are issues
[3973.0s] without question but you know I think if
[3976.44s] if a chinese doctor cured cancer yeah
[3979.96s] the US headline would be China Fires at
[3982.559s] doctors right just it just there&#39;s
[3985.96s] there&#39;s just this constant uh negative
[3989.24s] narrative and you know maybe that&#39;s
[3991.96s] where you know the US government needs
[3994.24s] to justify its existence with a
[3996.0s] Boogeyman and the problem is US
[3998.839s] investors are
[4000.92s] highly exposed to China yeah um and even
[4005.799s] you know that&#39;s through US
[4007.0s] multinationals like you know the Teslas
[4009.319s] and apples and boeings and caterpillars
[4012.039s] and Starbucks that are doing great in
[4014.799s] China and you know this idea that we
[4016.96s] have this huge trade deficit with China
[4018.88s] is is not true if you take the profits
[4022.88s] if you take the profits of us
[4025.319s] multinationals for the stuff they
[4027.319s] manufacture in China and sell to the
[4031.4s] Chinese it&#39;s about 500 billion which is
[4033.96s] the amount of the trade you know the
[4035.2s] trade deficit is what&#39;s put on a boat
[4038.48s] but if you include the goods
[4040.4s] manufactured in China by us multin there
[4044.24s] is no trade deficit but you never hear
[4047.0s] that in the Press so so that&#39;s a big
[4049.0s] part of you know an element of our
[4051.52s] research we want to provide is just
[4053.4s] saying hey there there&#39;s there&#39;s more
[4055.76s] more facets to that and then that dat is
[4057.96s] from the US from the New York Federal
[4059.799s] Reserve it&#39;s not from us now that that&#39;s
[4062.4s] really useful so um so if people want
[4065.559s] Diversified risk they can get kweb with
[4067.68s] that ticker
[4068.92s] kweb in their brokerage account um but
[4072.64s] what I want to talk about is uh just to
[4075.2s] to um last subject here is to go into
[4077.559s] alibaba&#39;s most recent earnings because
[4079.4s] what is going to be the driver because
[4080.799s] really honestly the F like if if China
[4083.68s] all the sudden wanted to get massive
[4086.44s] Equity inflows probably the number thing
[4089.279s] number one thing that they could do is
[4091.279s] buy Alibaba shares and drive the price
[4093.119s] up 50% because then all the indices
[4095.359s] would go up and then opinion follows
[4097.52s] Trend and all the pensions would be like
[4098.88s] you&#39;re under performing because you have
[4100.159s] no China exposure and it would just be
[4102.199s] like the oil thing in 2000 I&#39;m not
[4103.96s] saying they&#39;re going to do that like the
[4105.12s] Japan these did but they are in the
[4107.279s] market buying some equities leaving that
[4109.679s] aside let let&#39;s talk realistically about
[4111.96s] the the the pluses and minuses because
[4114.4s] to some degree the health of China
[4116.56s] equities is dependent on Alibaba because
[4118.48s] that&#39;s what westerners know yes you have
[4120.12s] 10
[4121.08s] cent speaking about outs we had the
[4123.44s] cloud we had the retail even fres shippo
[4126.0s] that thing could become the Costco of
[4127.92s] China I mean it&#39;s not there yet it&#39;s a
[4129.88s] couple billion dollar business but um um
[4134.04s] so so we talked about the the new buyers
[4136.319s] coming in they also announced something
[4138.199s] called they&#39;re going to copy 10 cent and
[4140.759s] Pino duo in doing the six uh 610 of 1%
[4145.679s] service software uh software service fee
[4149.08s] on all transactions I did a back of the
[4151.759s] napkin uh a math on that revenues last
[4155.88s] year for tbow and t-all were 57 billion
[4158.759s] so 60 bips on that is 342 million to the
[4163.04s] bottom line alone that starts in
[4164.96s] September
[4166.04s] which about 14 cents a share give or
[4167.96s] take it&#39;s not huge but but it increases
[4170.239s] the profitability increases the free
[4172.279s] cash flow now if they can buyb stocks
[4174.679s] through the southbound connect and not
[4177.239s] have to issue converts to buyback stocks
[4179.64s] that that could that could be a factor
[4181.48s] but you know revenues were anemic look
[4183.4s] GDP 5% they only did 4% revenues that&#39;s
[4186.48s] that&#39;s not great uh but Cloud business
[4189.719s] revenues finally re accelerated to
[4192.279s] 6% uh year-over-year and
[4195.64s] AI product Revenue grew at triple digits
[4199.52s] year-over-year so maybe speak a little
[4201.92s] bit
[4202.8s] about
[4204.32s] um my thinking about tab TL has always
[4207.36s] been like okay TL&#39;s got teemu&#39;s gotten
[4209.8s] some share because they&#39;re selling like
[4211.48s] the lowest end lowest margin stuff at a
[4214.239s] loss so they&#39;re getting share in a weak
[4216.84s] economy but when the economy normalizes
[4219.04s] and you want higher quality Goods uh no
[4222.08s] one can compete with tound t-all so it&#39;s
[4224.48s] kind of like a d double bite at the
[4226.04s] Apple as the economy improves the stock
[4228.239s] does better but as as the economy the
[4231.08s] business also starts to do materially
[4233.48s] better because timu is not really
[4235.199s] competing with them as aggressively in
[4237.4s] those areas that they&#39;re entrenched for
[4239.159s] over a decade um uh maybe speak to your
[4243.239s] thoughts on uh on alibaba&#39;s uh tbow
[4247.48s] t-all business and then maybe their
[4249.28s] Cloud business and future prospects yeah
[4252.0s] I think the e-commerce which you know in
[4254.8s] uh was
[4255.84s] you know 15 of the 36 billion in in you
[4259.96s] know the latest quarter Revenue you
[4262.92s] that&#39;s geared to China&#39;s domestic
[4264.92s] consumption story you know about 26% of
[4268.64s] all retail sales happens
[4271.199s] online um and and I think you know
[4273.84s] what&#39;s what we&#39;ve seen what&#39;s weighed on
[4276.08s] that business is you have this I call it
[4279.28s] scar tissue from zero Co that what
[4281.679s] happened in China was different than
[4283.48s] here and so out of that consumers have
[4286.96s] been very
[4288.56s] conservative um and then you also have a
[4292.28s] decline in real estate prices in China
[4295.64s] and and that&#39;s that&#39;s upwards of twoth
[4297.88s] thirds of urban household wealth in
[4300.12s] China is invested in housing and so as
[4302.96s] they&#39;ve lost they&#39;ve seen prices for the
[4305.12s] first time in their life have actually
[4307.239s] Fallen the the consumer you know they&#39;re
[4309.4s] being a little bit more cons more
[4311.48s] conservative I thought there was a
[4313.32s] interesting quote from alibaba&#39;s you
[4316.96s] know uh
[4318.239s] rival uh 10 cent that their Chief
[4322.04s] strategy uh
[4324.4s] officer uh had an interesting quote
[4327.0s] where there he said we&#39;ve seen the
[4329.12s] government actually rolling out very
[4331.48s] proactive policies to encourage
[4334.08s] consumption um that at some point the
[4336.12s] consumer siment as well as the economy
[4338.04s] will start
[4339.159s] turning um and that it&#39;s not that people
[4341.639s] don&#39;t have money people actually have
[4344.28s] have money but they chose rather not to
[4346.6s] spend it and government policies can
[4349.0s] induce more confidence among the
[4351.12s] consumer and start revitalizing parts of
[4353.679s] the economy so so anyway so I think I
[4355.96s] think you know I mean I like that quote
[4358.199s] you know from senior man you know senior
[4359.96s] person at 10 cent but but you know it
[4361.6s] speaks to what what&#39;s coming for Alibaba
[4364.639s] and so Alibaba you know in when the when
[4368.199s] the domestic consumtion piie was just
[4370.32s] growing growing growing when you&#39;ve got
[4372.52s] new newer competitors like pind duo duo
[4375.719s] or jd.com which historically has been
[4378.04s] willing to really drop their margins to
[4381.639s] Discount y you&#39;ve got uh bite dance Tik
[4386.04s] Tock in
[4387.36s] China so so part of the issue for for
[4390.04s] alib is when the pi stopped growing yeah
[4393.04s] started materially losing some market
[4395.08s] share so so my hope you know our you
[4397.679s] know our belief is that as the pie
[4400.04s] starts growing again it helps insulate
[4403.76s] Alibaba besides the moves they&#39;re making
[4406.679s] to to head off some of these competitive
[4408.96s] threats at the same time I do agree Tom
[4412.28s] that part of what gets us excited about
[4414.639s] this is the growth in
[4416.159s] Cloud um the non-china Ecommerce
[4419.88s] business you know which grew
[4422.239s] 32% um and then you&#39;ve got their
[4424.52s] Logistics business is doing great grew
[4427.08s] 16% so that&#39;s where you know the
[4429.679s] aggregate revenue for the company grew
[4432.32s] 6% even though that that
[4435.679s] Commerce is becoming they&#39;re becoming
[4437.8s] less dependent on over time um has had
[4441.32s] some challenges so so so you know we
[4443.6s] kind of Envision that the other parts of
[4445.84s] the business start taking up more of the
[4448.4s] slack and and certainly Alibaba is
[4452.719s] benefiting from you know kind of
[4455.44s] policies that the Chinese government has
[4459.44s] implemented in Southeast Asia in Africa
[4463.32s] in the Middle East in terms of building
[4466.199s] relationships this kind of belt and road
[4469.159s] yeah you China is a benef you know you
[4470.8s] know Alibaba is a beneficiary of that I
[4473.639s] mean there&#39;s you know so that you know
[4475.719s] as these governments do more you know
[4477.4s] the the President of Vietnam is in China
[4479.92s] today like you know do you think
[4482.0s] alibaba&#39;s benefits from that you bet you
[4484.32s] know not not through subsidies or
[4486.6s] anything it&#39;s just more of you know as
[4488.639s] these countries do trade deals you know
[4491.28s] it opens up the way for Al you know
[4492.76s] Alibaba doing incredible business in
[4494.6s] Turkey
[4495.8s] getting into Europe anyway so so yeah
[4499.04s] it&#39;s it&#39;s actually you know it&#39;s almost
[4501.32s] the irony of some of the Tariff talk
[4503.4s] where man don&#39;t you see how inflationary
[4505.239s] that is for the US consumers and here&#39;s
[4507.76s] where you can point to um you know
[4510.0s] trying to exports deflation and you know
[4512.76s] anyway so there&#39;s others elements of the
[4515.12s] business that has have us excited they
[4518.32s] just historically been really
[4519.52s] overshadowed by this core eccommerce but
[4523.12s] but we are more constructive going
[4525.159s] forward yeah all BuyBacks and dividends
[4529.239s] yeah yeah and and I think as it&#39;s
[4531.92s] interesting it&#39;s like the chip bans were
[4535.96s] the worst thing that we could do from a
[4537.8s] national security standpoint because
[4540.48s] what we have ultimately forced the
[4542.679s] Chinese to do is create competency
[4545.12s] themselves and all that means is you
[4546.88s] take some of the best people from our
[4548.36s] companies you offer them four times the
[4550.44s] pay and you basically get all the
[4552.08s] intellectual property transfer whereas
[4553.639s] when we were just willing to sell them
[4555.199s] and make them dependent on our drug
[4557.08s] which was semiconductors they weren&#39;t as
[4560.52s] urgently innovating and figuring out a
[4562.4s] way to do do it themselves and I think
[4564.8s] in some sense the weakness in the
[4567.28s] China&#39;s economy has forced companies
[4569.52s] like Alibaba to agressively grow
[4572.28s] internationally so all these things are
[4574.719s] going to hit all the cylinders are going
[4576.08s] to hit all at once they didn&#39;t have the
[4577.719s] cylinders of trendal and turkey and they
[4580.6s] and lzada and all these other and and
[4582.88s] theyve grown really fast in the Middle
[4585.32s] East and in Europe that that probably
[4587.84s] would be less of a possibility if China
[4590.56s] was you know growing the way it was so
[4592.88s] so as it returns it&#39;s going to be like
[4594.88s] everything all at once yeah I mean I
[4596.76s] think it&#39;s every you know every investor
[4599.52s] in apple should recognize the checkers
[4603.92s] and not chess strategy of policy
[4607.719s] toward um Huawei where you know this you
[4612.36s] know and and their telecommunication
[4614.199s] business you know have no idea if they
[4615.679s] were spying or they clearly engaged in
[4619.239s] corporate Espionage in the past I mean
[4621.6s] without question uh um but you know they
[4625.44s] also you know to when the Govern US
[4628.48s] government decided Huawei should pay for
[4630.4s] those sins in the past by cutting them
[4633.44s] off the the company had two choices
[4636.0s] either you go bankrupt or you innovate
[4639.96s] and that&#39;s that&#39;s created the number one
[4642.56s] competitive threat to Apple where they
[4645.76s] chose to innovate and they created this
[4647.639s] thing called the Huawei prom mate 60
[4650.32s] plus which is arguably a better phone
[4653.84s] than an iPhone wow and um it it&#39;s not
[4657.84s] some cheap
[4659.239s] knockoff it costs it&#39;s
[4662.96s] expensive uh but it&#39;s arguably a better
[4665.28s] phone I mean just flat out it&#39;s a better
[4667.6s] phone
[4669.04s] and um that has become a real problem
[4673.44s] for
[4675.12s] Apple in terms of iPhone sales in
[4678.04s] China uh but additionally similar to
[4681.44s] what you&#39;re see to your points on
[4683.28s] Alibaba with lzada and um you know
[4687.639s] Huawei you know they&#39;re not going to be
[4689.48s] allowed to sell them here but you bet
[4692.44s] they&#39;re selling them in Latin
[4694.52s] America yeah um in the Middle East
[4697.6s] across Asia because it&#39;s just it&#39;s a
[4699.4s] great phone yeah yeah so it goes to show
[4702.96s] you don&#39;t mess with the free markets uh
[4705.04s] a couple other things I wanted to
[4706.239s] highlight here Cloud Cloud&#39;s adjusted
[4708.08s] EBA increased
[4710.12s] 155% uh and he said quote we&#39;re
[4713.12s] observing strong and sustained demand
[4714.56s] for AI products and solutions from our
[4716.679s] customers uh continues to strengthen
[4718.88s] Market leadership so Cloud had been a
[4720.28s] drag because they were unwinding the Tik
[4722.6s] Tock business which was the largest
[4724.04s] customer and then they were cutting out
[4726.88s] um Shifting the the business public and
[4729.159s] private trying to get out the
[4730.719s] unprofitable business can you speak at
[4733.92s] all about
[4736.199s] uh either laying fears or talking about
[4739.12s] public and private cloud and how Alibaba
[4743.12s] can maintain its its hegemony in the
[4746.48s] space I think they&#39;ve got 38 to 41%
[4749.36s] share at the
[4750.719s] moment yeah I think in general some of
[4753.04s] the Diplomatic falling out where you can
[4755.28s] argue the US and China kind of went
[4757.0s] through a covid divorce you know they Co
[4759.32s] babies and and there&#39;s some signs of uh
[4762.48s] that&#39;s improving Panda&#39;s diplomacy
[4765.32s] and uh uh just this week U uh pboc met
[4769.76s] with US Treasury officials and but
[4772.6s] anyway but but there was there is a
[4774.159s] consequence and unfortunately for us
[4776.96s] Cloud they&#39;re going to lose those China
[4779.48s] customers if it&#39;s AWS or Microsoft
[4783.639s] Oracle um and and that will stay inhouse
[4787.08s] now now in general there&#39;s been there
[4789.36s] there&#39;s been encouragement from the
[4791.36s] government for state owned Enterprises
[4794.92s] and other other private companies in
[4798.0s] China to Leverage The technological
[4800.32s] capabilities of companies like
[4803.679s] Alibaba tensent and Badu who invested in
[4807.639s] you know kind of all the buzzwords AI
[4809.92s] Cloud big data that that they have a
[4813.0s] technological
[4814.36s] knowhow and and then if because of some
[4817.0s] of this diplomatic Fallout you&#39;re not
[4819.159s] going to be comfortable giving that to a
[4820.76s] US company you know no and vice versa
[4824.76s] then it&#39;s going to stay it&#39;s going to
[4826.08s] stay in China so so now the issue that
[4829.76s] Al you know what&#39;s interesting is people
[4831.92s] say oh well that&#39;s a pre- you you&#39;re
[4833.48s] pre-ordained Alibaba no no no like these
[4836.92s] companies in China compete with one
[4838.84s] another like nothing else and so I think
[4841.8s] you have this race to Garner market
[4844.92s] share that&#39;s weighed on some of the
[4847.48s] margins in Cloud um and and but that
[4851.52s] that will sort itself out right it&#39;ll
[4853.8s] find a balance
[4855.159s] if anything you&#39;re seeing some signs in
[4858.6s] in the electrical vehicle space or
[4860.44s] another where you there&#39;s no barriers to
[4863.159s] entry you&#39;ve got giomi which makes cell
[4866.52s] phones creating an EV like how the you
[4868.84s] know but you know so so that
[4871.719s] competitiveness in
[4873.639s] China um I think you&#39;re seeing the
[4875.76s] government say wait whoa whoa you know
[4877.719s] you know solar capacity EV capacity and
[4881.48s] I think that will happen in in cloud and
[4884.8s] in and actually in technology where
[4886.96s] you&#39;ll say Hey listen you can&#39;t you
[4889.32s] can&#39;t let these py victories take place
[4892.239s] so so I think I think you know the
[4894.639s] market will find is still finding its
[4897.88s] way on terms of pricing But ultimately
[4901.44s] Alibaba is really really well
[4903.8s] positioned uh and will be one of the
[4906.0s] winners
[4907.28s] there yeah no question and uh you know
[4910.639s] another thing that people are going to
[4911.76s] have some worry about is the uh free
[4915.36s] cash flow okay so they generated 4.6
[4917.84s] billion cash from operations 2.3 billion
[4920.8s] of free cash flow that that&#39;s down uh
[4923.76s] materially but they&#39; they&#39;ve identified
[4926.12s] two key reasons for that uh and maybe
[4929.239s] you want to speak to a little bit about
[4931.04s] that first was uh increase investments
[4934.32s] into Alibaba Cloud infrastructure so
[4936.719s] what they&#39;re saying is our demand is so
[4938.679s] strong that uh quote as soon as we get a
[4941.6s] server up a server is instantly running
[4943.56s] at full capacity that&#39;s the kind of
[4945.239s] demand so we can expect to see a very
[4947.08s] high Roi on over these uh next few
[4950.12s] quarters because we&#39;re building compute
[4952.08s] power to meet existing demand and that
[4954.4s] new compute power coming online is
[4956.159s] getting instantly taken up and running
[4958.6s] at full capacity on day one so they
[4960.639s] could either not invest and have five
[4962.96s] billion dollars of free cash flow or
[4965.159s] invest and and uh in in kind of the the
[4968.28s] Gold Rush days of AI cloud and gain
[4972.52s] share and keep their their hegemony
[4974.32s] which is what they&#39;ve chosen to do but
[4976.04s] the other thing that impacted free cash
[4978.28s] flow because we emphasize that on on a
[4980.679s] our podcast a lot when we&#39;re doing
[4982.52s] turnarounds we do a lot of turnaround
[4984.159s] situations Baba is one it and the CFO
[4987.76s] said quote your second question is about
[4989.76s] free cash flow as I explained there&#39;s
[4991.159s] quite a big significant drop of free
[4992.88s] cash flow one of the reasons is the
[4994.36s] significant increase in expenditure AI
[4996.48s] Investments uh the other reason is
[4998.639s] because of sort of the working capital
[5001.08s] changes in relation to some of the
[5002.719s] business scale jobs what they did which
[5006.159s] also hurt the tbow t-all was they&#39;re
[5009.719s] reducing that um direct sales business I
[5014.08s] don&#39;t know if you&#39;re familiar with but
[5015.36s] that was down material they&#39;re
[5016.96s] proactively doing that because I guess
[5018.84s] it was low margin and he goes if you
[5021.32s] look at the business scale jobs many of
[5022.719s] them the majority are from those plan
[5024.76s] scale down as if you like as I was
[5027.52s] explaining why our direct sales business
[5029.12s] within tawau and t-ball dropped quite
[5031.56s] significantly the reason is we
[5033.4s] proactively scaled some of these onep
[5036.0s] business in T tbal and t-all we believe
[5039.719s] in some of these business categories
[5041.52s] onep format probably not a more
[5044.239s] efficient format so that sort of
[5046.36s] practice but if you uh but you will also
[5049.76s] have some of the business scale job was
[5051.84s] not proactively did that some of that
[5054.719s] overall Market situation the revenue
[5057.88s] dropped for example from SAA like in
[5061.159s] time all those businesses are one p and
[5063.639s] the job of their SC actually impacts
[5065.32s] working capital uh I don&#39;t know I can
[5067.8s] probably give you a bit more color on
[5069.4s] because one p on the other hand you&#39;re
[5071.32s] buying inventory from a vendor on the
[5073.88s] other hand you sell it and does the
[5076.28s] vendor normally give you a credit term
[5078.199s] like 60 days or 90 days if you can make
[5080.36s] your money your inventory turn over I.E
[5083.0s] sell inventory within a short period of
[5084.96s] time shorter than the short-term credit
[5087.32s] you&#39;re given actually you are generating
[5089.88s] cash flow particularly if the size is
[5091.92s] going up you&#39;re generating positive cash
[5093.679s] flow so on the contrary if you&#39;re
[5095.96s] reducing scale in this case on purpose
[5099.48s] uh it will have outflow on the working
[5101.88s] capital but is that a permanent impact
[5104.44s] he&#39;s he&#39;s asking a rhetorical question
[5106.199s] and he says to me I think that is
[5108.159s] relatively temporary impact so this
[5111.44s] process of reducing sale in that direct
[5113.6s] sales business uh we see this type of
[5116.0s] outfly outflow but when the business
[5118.08s] becomes stable we will no no longer see
[5120.239s] these types of outflows so for everyone
[5121.8s] worried about free cash flow and is the
[5124.04s] business
[5124.88s] deteriorating it&#39;s not it&#39;s one it&#39;s
[5127.239s] proactive decision on on uh investment
[5130.36s] and number two taking down this business
[5132.88s] this undesirable business the direct
[5134.52s] sales business for them is impacting
[5136.8s] working capital which is what is is
[5138.56s] impacting free cash flow and you can see
[5140.6s] that partially evidenced in cash from
[5142.4s] operations still being $4.6 billion and
[5144.96s] then buying back $5.8
[5146.96s] billion uh of
[5149.04s] stock um so I I think that&#39;s kind of the
[5153.04s] the key highlights good to see the AI
[5155.56s] revenues up 200% uh it&#39;s good to get
[5158.639s] that explanation and then Eddie woo the
[5160.96s] CEO uh proclaimed that they&#39;re going to
[5163.32s] return to double digit Revenue growth in
[5165.719s] the second half of the fiscal year with
[5167.92s] gradual acceleration thereafter that&#39;s
[5169.96s] huge because no one is predicting that
[5173.199s] China GDP is going to go up to 8% or 9%
[5176.96s] so he&#39;s saying we&#39;re going to go from
[5178.96s] underperforming GDP in tbal and t-all to
[5182.199s] dramatically outperforming
[5184.52s] uh GDP as as the the monster player um
[5189.28s] and then the final thing I&#39;d say two
[5191.04s] things that I liked about getting the
[5192.4s] cash under control first thing was this
[5195.4s] was a real pet PE mine so they bought
[5198.0s] $5.8 billion a stock but it was a net
[5202.199s] reduction of
[5203.6s] 2.3% of the share count uh because
[5207.0s] they&#39;ve been doing a lot of employe
[5208.44s] stock options uh uh Employee Stock plan
[5212.0s] and which you said when meeting with
[5213.88s] these people people they were really
[5215.8s] motivated to get the stock price up
[5218.08s] because they all have a ton of stock
[5219.88s] what I&#39;m glad about is that starting
[5222.0s] last last quarter they started to
[5224.4s] replace a portion of alibaba&#39;s uh ESOP
[5227.56s] incentives with long-term cash
[5229.32s] incentives for our employees starting
[5231.32s] last quarter these cash incentives will
[5233.199s] be reflected as cost and this is huge as
[5235.28s] an owner they going to be less shares
[5238.159s] less slices of the pie given out and
[5240.92s] they&#39;ll have that cash restricted over
[5243.199s] time cash is one time pay slice of the
[5245.92s] pie is a forever pay which as an owner
[5249.199s] I&#39;m I&#39;m less inclined and then finally
[5250.92s] they cut 6700 jobs which uh it&#39;s good to
[5254.56s] see them taking a little B bureaucracy
[5257.04s] out out of the business as well so Allin
[5260.0s] I mean this thing looks primed and
[5261.92s] poised to and when it turns it turns
[5264.159s] abruptly whether the Catalyst will be
[5266.0s] some policy from the Chinese government
[5268.52s] or this 20 billion to 30 billion of new
[5271.6s] buyers uh or the weakening dollar or the
[5274.92s] actual change in fed policy where we&#39;ve
[5276.719s] seen historically dollar goes down Yuan
[5278.719s] starts to appreciate bond yields Chinese
[5281.32s] bond yields start to go up a Yen starts
[5283.8s] to go up uh and and all of these things
[5286.76s] click all at once but but my experience
[5289.0s] and just looking at the the history is
[5292.119s] while they take a long time to turn and
[5294.44s] we you know two and a half years is a
[5295.96s] long time by historical standards kind
[5298.56s] of in line when they do turn it is so
[5302.0s] abrupt and material and uh maybe you
[5304.719s] could just speak to that and and any of
[5307.52s] the other points that I made on Alibaba
[5310.08s] as we wrap up oh no it&#39;s uh yeah you do
[5312.32s] an incredible service to your your
[5315.52s] subscribers and listeners just your
[5317.52s] death of analysis and um yeah yeah I
[5320.719s] mean in
[5321.96s] general I mean I think um you you&#39;ve had
[5325.32s] a little bit of an unwind in terms of
[5327.28s] China
[5328.52s] allocations I think Geographic there&#39;s a
[5331.76s] geographical that you know a lot of us
[5334.56s] investors went underweight or exited or
[5337.679s] were neutral because of the you know
[5340.36s] Trump with the trade War became the tech
[5342.56s] war and then zero
[5344.36s] covid uh some of the internet regulation
[5347.159s] and and a lot of European investors
[5349.639s] really got
[5350.88s] hurt um when Russia invaded the Ukraine
[5355.36s] because they were very overweight Russia
[5356.8s] and they said wow if you know if China
[5359.76s] were you know you Russia was overweight
[5362.28s] but it was small position if if China
[5364.32s] ever invaded Taiwan you know that that&#39;s
[5366.32s] a big
[5367.52s] position uh within
[5370.04s] Asia I think a lot of those investors
[5372.639s] were slower in coming out because
[5374.96s] obviously it&#39;s an important regionally
[5376.96s] economically but even going there so
[5380.199s] they they they were slower to come out
[5382.4s] and then actually I think investors in
[5384.48s] China were really the last to come out
[5387.199s] because they&#39;d say you know I&#39;m still
[5388.84s] using Alibaba or uh the world&#39;s not
[5392.0s] ending um and and so that that led to a
[5395.719s] real capitulation in in January of this
[5399.32s] year where the Chinese markets really
[5401.8s] rolled down because there was uh there
[5404.8s] were literally no buyers there&#39;s um and
[5407.239s] then there&#39;s other factors um you know
[5409.76s] actively managed funds have really
[5412.56s] suffered uh from the flows in the
[5415.28s] passive funds there&#39;s no dip buyers left
[5418.52s] yeah you know ETFs are kind of there&#39;s a
[5421.199s] momentum element You could argue
[5424.199s] um and so yeah we think the rewind will
[5428.4s] happen in Reverse which will the Chinese
[5430.44s] will be buy China yeah and and you&#39;re
[5433.08s] actually seeing that that in through
[5435.239s] this southbound stock connect Chinese
[5438.639s] investors have bought more stock and
[5441.639s] ETFs year to date than in all of
[5445.52s] 2023 wow you know just about $45 billion
[5449.639s] and so in Asia I think the view is well
[5454.04s] if that Yen starts appreciating that&#39;s a
[5456.52s] problem to being overweight Japan right
[5458.8s] that could that could actually and then
[5461.04s] India to to your point Tom yeah we do
[5463.28s] think it&#39;s um it&#39;s professional
[5466.56s] investors are going underway because of
[5468.719s] the
[5469.84s] valuations it&#39;s a very retail driven
[5472.679s] Market it&#39;s actually the largest
[5474.199s] derivative Market in Asia you know
[5477.28s] people talk about in the US everyone
[5479.239s] makes fun of this odte of in you know U
[5482.84s] but in in you know check it out in in
[5485.32s] India you know huge options derivative
[5488.56s] market and when you sort for the largest
[5491.119s] derivative P positions in in India you
[5495.52s] got to go way down until you hit the
[5497.6s] first put wow all calls wow that&#39;s
[5503.04s] that&#39;s part of what&#39;s you know this
[5505.48s] retail
[5507.48s] enthusiasm um because their economy is
[5510.0s] doing well and
[5511.6s] Modi um but but there is this odte
[5515.679s] effect I mean they don&#39;t have odte
[5517.719s] options but but you know so anyway so so
[5520.44s] a lot of professional investors are
[5522.32s] saying hey maybe I should be a little
[5523.84s] nervous about about India and and so I
[5527.92s] think I think over time um I think a lot
[5531.84s] of as well as the other big overweight
[5533.639s] in Asia is US equities I mean it
[5536.52s] just um I I just I really do but think a
[5541.719s] lot of this money is uh retail money out
[5545.04s] of
[5546.36s] Asia and uh the dollar the dollar
[5549.639s] declines that&#39;s going to weigh on you
[5551.48s] know if you&#39;re levered up you know it
[5553.76s] doesn&#39;t take much until you get really
[5555.8s] hurt you know as we saw with the Yen
[5558.159s] carry trade um but I think I think you
[5562.92s] know you know either elements of that
[5566.92s] start flowing back Ian that&#39;s that&#39;s
[5568.32s] been my counsil to people is like hey
[5570.08s] like I&#39;m not you know you know you know
[5573.0s] I&#39;d be charging 2 and 20 if I could
[5574.639s] predict the future right why why would
[5577.159s] you not take a piece of US tech profit
[5580.48s] and put in cheap China yeah you know Che
[5583.48s] China attack like what like just take a
[5586.04s] little smidge like why would you not you
[5588.36s] know you know particularly you know with
[5591.0s] the um election you know what are you
[5594.84s] know based on who wins what happens with
[5596.52s] long-term cap gains like uh there&#39;s all
[5599.36s] these different scenarios like why would
[5600.76s] you just take a piece you know tell high
[5604.0s] and Buy Low like why why would you not
[5605.8s] do that yeah for a piece right um I I
[5609.92s] think I think there&#39;s an argument we&#39;re
[5611.199s] starting to see that yeah yeah and it&#39;s
[5614.04s] um you know it&#39;s the old saying good
[5616.239s] things happen when you buy high quality
[5618.199s] assets at low prices I mean it&#39;s just a
[5620.199s] matter of of it&#39;s not a it&#39;s never a
[5622.48s] question of if it&#39;s a me it&#39;s a question
[5625.32s] of when and uh and the same will be true
[5628.52s] I I love that you brought up that energy
[5630.719s] analogy in 2020 because it was that same
[5633.88s] level of pessimism that pensions will
[5636.88s] never again invest in until the price
[5639.04s] goes up and everyone chases it and uh
[5641.84s] and I could certainly see I mean you
[5644.28s] know mag 7 their earnings growth
[5646.239s] decelerating from
[5647.8s] 50% to 20% doesn&#39;t mean they&#39;re going to
[5651.159s] crash like the Tech rec they&#39;re just
[5652.679s] going to I think perform less well than
[5655.44s] they have in the rearview mirror
[5656.719s] there&#39;ll be a lot of money made under
[5657.92s] the surface but you can make tons of
[5660.199s] doubles and triples under the surface uh
[5662.92s] and the indices don&#39;t don&#39;t do much uh
[5665.36s] and that would imply that the mag 7 you
[5667.76s] know maybe they get back up to highs and
[5669.719s] they just grind for a year you know and
[5672.239s] and uh and as the dollar weakens we
[5673.96s] start to to see this diversification so
[5676.199s] I&#39;m very excited one of the things I
[5677.719s] like to look at every day when I wake up
[5680.0s] is your writing on China last night.com
[5683.4s] so maybe if you could tell people how to
[5685.4s] follow you where you are on Twitter tell
[5687.52s] them a little bit about your daily China
[5689.48s] note uh and and uh and and lastly your
[5692.76s] ETF and then we&#39;ll wrap up yeah no than
[5696.52s] and any final thoughts also yeah yeah
[5698.6s] yeah yeah I mean um you know our such a
[5701.159s] key thesis at cran shers is providing a
[5703.8s] DAT data driven perspective on what&#39;s
[5705.8s] happening in China&#39;s economy and capital
[5708.199s] markets and uh you know in order to do
[5710.679s] so I I write you know I&#39;ve been doing it
[5713.44s] for I think like seven
[5716.44s] years um China last night.com which is
[5720.199s] just a brief concise overview of what
[5723.28s] happened last night in China what&#39;s
[5725.76s] important and I used it as an element to
[5729.48s] maybe negate you know some of the
[5731.52s] popular Western headlines that are not
[5734.119s] necessarily data driven I jokingly say
[5736.84s] no one should read it not even my mom
[5738.48s] reads it every day but if you subscribe
[5741.52s] and and it&#39;s free it&#39;s there when
[5744.08s] something happens and you&#39;re like oh
[5745.76s] like what what why is the market up or
[5747.96s] down you&#39;d be like oh okay like here&#39;s
[5749.8s] China last night and uh um and so yeah
[5753.8s] and then on Twitter um I do put out you
[5757.0s] know um you know you know when when
[5759.719s] available at uh you know Hearn ah ernor
[5764.719s] Brendan uh at Twitter but then of course
[5768.119s] at cran shares.com we have
[5770.28s] research uh on on the ETFs as well as
[5773.56s] crane shares uh on our is our Twitter
[5775.8s] handle so um you but the whole point is
[5778.88s] like you know you do you give you like
[5781.4s] what you&#39;re you do Tom you provide great
[5784.0s] research and you&#39;d earn the trust of
[5786.44s] investors and that&#39;s that&#39;s that&#39;s been
[5788.4s] our Playbook uh going back to 2013 is
[5791.84s] just you know we just want to be a
[5793.44s] resource and you know try to try to do
[5796.76s] uh we can&#39;t solve markets you know I I
[5799.44s] wish I had that
[5801.08s] ability uh but no we&#39;re we&#39;re very
[5803.48s] constructive and U I think I think yeah
[5806.56s] there&#39;s Market leadership regime changes
[5809.199s] a super tanker and and it doesn&#39;t happen
[5812.32s] overnight there&#39;s no you know you know
[5815.199s] it&#39;s not you know like the crispy scene
[5816.96s] Crispy Cream sign going off it&#39;s not
[5819.84s] that easy it&#39;s slow and but I think I
[5823.04s] think there&#39;s a huge home bias to us
[5825.96s] equities but I think it is a global bias
[5828.76s] to us equities and I would argue that
[5831.92s] there&#39;s some real arguments that&#39;s
[5833.88s] changing and I think great companies in
[5836.719s] China including Alibaba they&#39;re they&#39;re
[5839.639s] putting you know their you know really
[5841.679s] their wallet where their mouth is and
[5844.52s] you know if these Tech entrepreneurs are
[5846.76s] buying back stock that probably means
[5850.159s] China&#39;s economy is not to do a thelman
[5852.239s] and Louise and go off a cliff yeah that
[5854.92s] their own company&#39;s Prospect like
[5856.96s] Alibaba is not about to go off a cliff
[5859.48s] that they see something and they&#39;re
[5861.08s] doing something about it and the
[5862.56s] question is like what are we as inv
[5865.48s] investors doing when we see that and I&#39;d
[5869.119s] say like listen this stuff is volatile I
[5872.04s] mean um you know it&#39;s it&#39;s part of a
[5874.44s] well- diversified portfolio you know
[5877.04s] these stocks these ETFs two to three
[5880.4s] times more volatile than the S&amp;P 500 so
[5883.119s] you just got to volatility adjust your
[5885.08s] position but yeah we&#39;re we&#39;re
[5886.719s] constructive we see an opportunity I
[5888.32s] mean we&#39;re that&#39;s self-serving and
[5890.239s] highly biased I mean that&#39;s the asterisk
[5892.239s] you know well very heavily invested
[5894.96s] personally and it&#39;s been it&#39;s been it&#39;s
[5897.36s] been it&#39;s been a brutal you know really
[5899.119s] three and a half years um but you know I
[5902.76s] think these things do pass for sure yeah
[5905.719s] well I think we&#39;ve we&#39;ve rung out a lot
[5907.52s] of the downside volatility and it&#39;ll be
[5909.599s] fun to to experience the upside
[5911.92s] volatility uh when it finally turns so
[5914.96s] uh yeah want to want to thank you and
[5916.84s] one last thing I would just say is that
[5918.76s] uh one of the guys that uh I admire
[5921.04s] quite a bit obviously I&#39;m a Buffett
[5922.599s] Acolyte and Munger and all those guys
[5924.679s] but another one that&#39;s more along the
[5926.8s] lines of my style is David terer and uh
[5930.199s] he just wrote a billion dollar check to
[5931.719s] buy some Alibaba uh in the last quarter
[5934.96s] uh last couple of quarters so um you
[5939.28s] know another value guy another value guy
[5942.239s] but a guy with uh you know some dramatic
[5944.599s] outperformance over decades you know 30%
[5947.52s] kager over many decades a legend uh and
[5950.639s] what I love about uh that you know what
[5953.08s] I what I wish we saw more with American
[5956.28s] companies when American company stock
[5960.159s] craters management don&#39;t buy in stock
[5963.48s] the way that they do in China and and I
[5965.92s] love the fact that the Chinese have the
[5968.159s] right mindset that when the price goes
[5970.52s] down and you believe in your prospects
[5972.119s] that&#39;s when you load the boat and you
[5973.679s] buy all the stock you don&#39;t crawl under
[5975.32s] the desk um and and I think that&#39;s going
[5977.92s] to serve us as owners very very well
[5980.84s] that they were reducing the float and in
[5982.76s] Baba&#39;s case now even doing it more
[5985.199s] aggressively and saying you guys have
[5987.119s] enough pieces of the pie we&#39;re going to
[5988.719s] give you cash bonuses and we&#39;re going to
[5990.679s] let the owners take the ride with us so
[5992.599s] get in get on before we take off yeah
[5995.0s] and you know at year end uh I think Joe
[5998.96s] Sai and jackm who&#39;s retired from the you
[6001.4s] know did took big you know made a big
[6004.48s] big purchase uh I you know I forget what
[6007.639s] the exact numbers but uh yeah just just
[6009.76s] a very solid sign all all in you know
[6011.92s] all together yeah yeah and they&#39;re
[6013.639s] turning the boat well with that said
[6015.199s] thank you so much for your time I know
[6017.119s] we&#39;re going to get out on the link soon
[6018.679s] together and uh we&#39;ll we&#39;ll uh hope
[6021.239s] everyone enjoys this no thank you thank
[6023.4s] you so much for the opportunity Tom all
[6026.56s] right and we&#39;re
[6028.88s] back so now we&#39;re going to shift gears
[6032.599s] over to our wasn&#39;t that incredible by
[6034.52s] the way now we&#39;re going to shift gears
[6035.84s] to our normal scheduled programming uh
[6038.96s] we got a super amount of value this week
[6042.119s] for you uh so those of you on vacation
[6044.679s] you&#39;re missing out I got to tell you uh
[6047.04s] but starting with the quote of the week
[6048.679s] we&#39;ve got two Warren Buffett look at
[6051.8s] Market fluctuations as your friend
[6053.88s] rather than your enemy profit from Folly
[6056.679s] rather than participate in it and the
[6059.28s] second one is I will tell you how to
[6062.199s] become rich close the doors be fearful
[6065.4s] when others are greedy be greedy when
[6067.8s] others are fearful uh that&#39;s both from
[6070.36s] Warren Buffett that&#39;s a good context and
[6072.4s] as always my favorite mug hedge fun tips
[6074.92s] on one side opinions not
[6078.28s] advice C terms on the other side
[6083.36s] so from my friends out in Dallas so go
[6087.0s] up here and click on terms also we&#39;re
[6089.92s] going to be hiring a new video editor to
[6093.08s] do all the social stuff that we post on
[6095.639s] LinkedIn and Twitter and Tik Tok and
[6097.84s] everything else we got two fantastic
[6100.28s] candidates uh I&#39;ve said that uh we
[6102.76s] narrowed out that those and they&#39;ve been
[6105.28s] qualified because both of them have
[6108.0s] listened to the podcast for 2 years or
[6110.679s] more so they know the Conta they know
[6114.08s] they&#39;re schooled in it it&#39;s not just
[6115.679s] people that can cut videos it&#39;s people
[6117.639s] that can think and understand that I how
[6120.44s] I think so uh both of you uh uh that
[6125.28s] I&#39;ve emailed send me the information
[6128.4s] that I&#39;ve sent I will be in touch with
[6129.84s] you early next week and I&#39;ll make a
[6131.36s] final decision sometime mid next week if
[6135.239s] we are short on videos in the meantime
[6138.08s] uh guys just uh you know deal with it
[6140.639s] it&#39;s we got to find the right person
[6143.36s] that that really understands it and has
[6144.96s] been with us for a while so excited to
[6147.04s] go through that process if you still
[6148.56s] haven&#39;t applied go to my Twitter feed
[6151.239s] scroll down to the video it explains how
[6153.119s] to apply and what I&#39;m looking for our
[6155.88s] article of the week we covered a lot of
[6157.76s] this with
[6160.239s] Brendan uh so uh just want to cover a
[6163.119s] few critically key points and
[6165.44s] reemphasize so everyone understands
[6167.679s] what&#39;s going on uh first and foremost
[6170.28s] BuyBacks through the roof you can see it
[6172.08s] here uh we went oh this is interesting
[6175.04s] from Goldman Sachs I referenced fast
[6177.76s] lane and the checkout system that
[6179.639s] increases conversion from 50% to 80%
[6182.8s] while just a couple of days after PayPal
[6185.639s] announced a partnership with Aiden which
[6187.52s] is a huge payments processor in Europe
[6190.4s] to offer fast lane and here&#39;s what
[6192.88s] Goldman Sachs had to say about it uh aen
[6195.4s] offering fast lane to its Enterprise
[6196.92s] Merchant and and Marketplace customers
[6199.159s] fast lane allows first-time users to
[6200.8s] save their C card and shipping
[6202.4s] information then automatically pre-fills
[6204.719s] these fields at Merchants using fast
[6206.56s] lane for all future purchases this
[6208.599s] improves guest checkout conversion rate
[6210.44s] to 80 plus% and reduces time to check
[6213.88s] out by
[6215.32s] 32% uh we view the announcement as a
[6218.08s] positive development for PayPal as
[6219.719s] distribution for Fast Lane expands
[6221.92s] expands particularly if offered via aen
[6225.76s] addan which has strong Global Enterprise
[6229.239s] relationships in particular we believe
[6231.48s] the distribution of Fast Lane through
[6233.32s] similar to branded checkout and other
[6235.56s] payment methods shows increased ability
[6238.199s] to compete versus other methods of
[6240.08s] online
[6241.239s] checkout we also see this as consistent
[6244.32s] with Management&#39;s commentary around the
[6246.679s] potential to unbundle fast lane from
[6249.88s] branded and unbranded checkout which we
[6252.48s] believe helps PayPal to compete on a
[6254.48s] more similar playing field to Apple pay
[6257.52s] and Google pay uh we see this as a
[6260.199s] positive for PayPal&#39;s distribution and
[6262.08s] continued sign of the strong execution
[6265.199s] at the company since the current
[6267.599s] management team took the the helm IE
[6271.239s] Alex Chris who came from into it who ran
[6273.96s] 50% of the business while over 10 years
[6276.679s] that stock was a
[6278.599s] 38 bagger so um we&#39;re excited about that
[6283.48s] we covered uh Charles this is critically
[6286.199s] important you will understand the
[6288.159s] significance of the chart below after
[6290.119s] you listen to my conversation with
[6291.8s] Charles Payne and and which you just did
[6294.28s] and read the article from last week
[6297.119s] here&#39;s the link to the article from last
[6298.8s] week this by the way not only goes into
[6301.76s] our updates last week but it has links
[6304.4s] back to our original thesis uh when we
[6307.52s] got involved in the company in May of
[6310.44s] 2022 at
[6312.84s] $510 um so per share you will
[6317.48s] understand as it relates to vehicle
[6320.119s] incentives one of our loyal podcast
[6323.04s] video cast viewers hat tip to Stephen
[6326.159s] Frampton sent us this updated updated
[6329.04s] chart from Cox Automotive uh and then
[6332.08s] I&#39;ve made these annotations on it and
[6334.239s] here&#39;s what we&#39;ve been saying people
[6335.44s] have been worried oh my gosh dealer
[6337.679s] inventories are growing they&#39;re
[6338.88s] increasing incentives increasing
[6340.76s] incentives are the name of the game when
[6342.28s] you want volume we are not in the
[6344.119s] business of Ford and GM making as much
[6346.48s] money per car as possible we are in the
[6348.96s] business of Ford and GM making as many
[6351.88s] cars as possible
[6353.639s] that is the critical name of the game
[6356.88s] and so right now vehicle incentives are
[6360.679s] at
[6361.719s] 7% of total purchase price in 2017 they
[6367.0s] got up to
[6369.08s] 11% of total purchase price and average
[6373.44s] incentives in July Rose to 7% uh or 33
[6379.04s] 3,383 per car up from 6.4% in June and
[6383.119s] the most generous level seen in 2024
[6386.36s] incentives are now Higher by 59.1%
[6389.119s] compared to one year ago when the
[6390.92s] average incentive package was 4.4% of of
[6394.4s] uh total purchase price in July of 2023
[6397.84s] new vehicle incentives in July were at
[6399.719s] their highest point in more than three
[6403.199s] years this is huge this is going to show
[6406.599s] us big volumes because like I said the
[6409.56s] cartel that GM and Ford and Stanis had
[6414.4s] during covid when they could control
[6416.639s] Supply and charge as much as humanly
[6419.239s] possible per car um uh is is over okay
[6425.56s] and now you know the Koreans are putting
[6427.8s] in cheaper cars and they&#39;re going to
[6430.32s] have to buy make smaller cars massive
[6432.56s] cars massive volume and CPS gets paid
[6435.639s] per car and it&#39;s it&#39;s pretty much the
[6437.36s] same amount of cars parts per car uh
[6440.599s] except for the fact if you go to hybrids
[6442.599s] it dramatically increases the cost per
[6444.84s] vehicle for Cooper standard in other
[6447.239s] words Hy hybrids are even better than uh
[6449.44s] internal combustion and EVS as well
[6452.599s] which are slowing demand but the big
[6454.199s] where they make all the biggest amount
[6456.0s] of money is the hybrids uh I are good uh
[6459.679s] EVS are good but I think demand is
[6461.199s] waning for
[6463.0s] EVS all right Alibaba update so we
[6467.719s] covered with Brendan the this 20 billion
[6472.199s] coming in they had a shareholder vote
[6474.48s] today I&#39;m sure there&#39;ll be an
[6475.8s] announcement tomorrow I&#39;m sure that went
[6478.0s] through in which case the southbound
[6480.32s] link opens which could be as early as
[6482.96s] September 9th uh we were talking about
[6486.04s] $20 billion of flows uh Brendan
[6489.4s] referenced maybe 30 or 40 billion of
[6491.719s] inflows which would be 20% of the float
[6494.36s] which would be absolutely unbelievable
[6496.28s] but I think that&#39;s true like if you&#39;ve
[6498.48s] got you know if you weren&#39;t allowed to
[6500.599s] own Amazon for all these years and you
[6503.0s] have three boxes a day coming to your
[6504.719s] door and you&#39;re you know buying books
[6507.28s] and audibles and watching their videos
[6509.92s] and a Prime member subscriber and all of
[6512.4s] a sudden you have the chance to
[6514.8s] participate in that and buy it you&#39;re
[6516.719s] going to buy it hand over fist and I
[6518.04s] think the Chinese you know it&#39;s the
[6519.28s] national champion I think it&#39;s going to
[6520.679s] be uh um you know over subscribed so to
[6524.36s] speak in terms of demand so that&#39;s that
[6528.08s] they went through the historic stuff
[6529.639s] here next plan the vote is today and
[6532.92s] stock connect on September 9th you can
[6534.52s] see in the Bloomberg article also we
[6536.719s] covered with Brendan the uh 60 basis
[6539.84s] points
[6541.0s] on um t-all and tawau transactions which
[6546.599s] is in line with their competitors JD and
[6549.36s] Pino Doo has been doing it for a while
[6551.239s] they&#39;re now going to get that that&#39;s 343
[6553.4s] million to the bottom line and more
[6555.56s] that&#39;s on last year sales so
[6557.32s] prospectively it starts in September
[6559.679s] that&#39;s straight to the bottom line and
[6561.4s] then even the cell side got excited
[6563.719s] after earnings uh Bank of America came
[6567.56s] out um talking about
[6571.239s] um profit let&#39;s see reiterate Buy on
[6574.96s] improving growth Outlook uh solid in
[6578.04s] investor return execution profit beats
[6580.56s] consensus as enhanced cost disciplines
[6582.44s] across the
[6583.52s] business uh and then they go through the
[6585.599s] growth and the expectations
[6588.199s] Etc so the key highlights here we
[6590.8s] covered quite a few of them total
[6593.119s] revenues are up four 4% Cloud business
[6595.0s] grew
[6596.04s] 6% uh Cloud adjusted e up 135% AI
[6600.679s] revenues grew triple digit year onye
[6603.84s] paying users of Alibaba AI uh stuff 200%
[6607.8s] quarteron quarter uh International grew
[6610.52s] 32% K now grew 16% they re purchased 5.8
[6615.119s] billion a stock reduced the float by
[6617.28s] 2.3% that&#39;s going to get better and
[6619.4s] better because now they&#39;re shifting from
[6621.88s] all stock option uh all stock incentives
[6625.4s] to now cash which I&#39;ve been pounding the
[6627.4s] table on for a year why are they giving
[6629.52s] away so much stock so now they&#39;re going
[6630.88s] to do cash I love cash bonuses
[6633.44s] restricted over time because cash is a
[6635.96s] one-time payment a slice of the pie is a
[6638.28s] forever payment I&#39;d rather give them a
[6640.119s] one-time payment versus a forever
[6641.8s] payment they&#39;ve got enough stock they
[6643.76s] have the same incentives we have as
[6645.96s] co-owners they cut 6,700 jobs so they&#39;re
[6648.92s] sewing discipline uh and for the free
[6652.36s] cash flow which we&#39;re going to spend
[6654.44s] reiterate we covered with Brendan uh
[6656.8s] people were worried about that they
[6659.04s] still did 4.6 billion from operations
[6661.52s] they did 2.3 billion of free cash flow
[6665.079s] that was attributable to two things just
[6667.119s] to reemphasize I&#39;m not going to read the
[6669.239s] quote again but uh working capital as it
[6672.36s] related to taking down proactively
[6674.36s] taking down the wholesale I&#39;m sorry the
[6676.32s] direct sales business at tbow t-all um
[6681.4s] and um and by the way that noise in the
[6683.56s] background they&#39;re cutting a bunch of
[6684.92s] trees on the property so uh just we&#39;ll
[6687.599s] just deal with it um so that was one and
[6691.199s] number two uh investment in AI Cloud
[6693.84s] because they can&#39;t keep up with demand
[6695.239s] so they got to build new servers new
[6696.96s] data centers because the compute demand
[6699.079s] is literally unlimited and they&#39;re the
[6701.04s] number one player so it all they have to
[6703.159s] do is suck in all these people now at
[6705.679s] low margins and then once they&#39;ve
[6708.04s] dominated everything then they can raise
[6709.8s] price once everyone&#39;s stuck on their
[6711.4s] stuff the switching costs are
[6713.079s] higher than you think it&#39;s a pain in the
[6714.679s] ass if you&#39;re a CTO you don&#39;t want to
[6716.32s] switch if you don&#39;t have to so you let
[6718.679s] you know inertia is the name of the game
[6722.8s] um internal and external ecommer market
[6727.0s] share ah this is
[6730.239s] key so internal and external data about
[6734.04s] e-commerce players market share Dynamics
[6736.76s] indicates a positive trend in gradual
[6738.92s] market share stabilization so they they
[6741.28s] lost they they stopped losing share and
[6744.92s] they&#39;re actually starting to regain
[6746.92s] share is what they said in the Q&amp;A
[6750.079s] section
[6752.52s] um also their CMR growth uh the the GM
[6757.92s] gross merchandise volume growth grew
[6760.679s] High grew double digits the CMR gr
[6764.32s] growth the margin on that didn&#39;t grow as
[6767.0s] fast because obviously they&#39;re they&#39;re
[6768.44s] now boxing out teu and uh pindu Duo
[6772.639s] bigger they&#39;re better they&#39;re stronger
[6773.88s] they&#39;re going to kick them in the teeth
[6775.28s] the economy is going to recover and then
[6777.04s] the higher end stuff where which they
[6778.92s] own uh is going to dominate but in the
[6781.36s] meantime they&#39;re like we&#39;re going to
[6782.639s] even kick them where where we don&#39;t play
[6786.52s] and we&#39;re going to go after them in the
[6787.8s] low-end lowquality stuff and we&#39;re going
[6790.84s] to do that for a while which they did
[6793.159s] and that impacted their CMR but they
[6795.48s] expect that to catch up to G gross
[6799.0s] merchandise value very very quickly cuz
[6801.28s] they had to move fast which they did and
[6803.36s] now they&#39;re caught up and the margins
[6805.4s] are going to go back so we&#39;re confident
[6807.199s] that alibaba&#39;s overall Revenue excluding
[6810.48s] Alibaba Consolidated subsidiaries will
[6812.679s] return to double digit growth in the
[6815.28s] second half of the fiscal year with
[6817.719s] gradual acceleration thereafter they
[6820.8s] still have
[6821.76s] 26.1 billion remaining on the share
[6824.239s] repurchase availability and as we&#39;
[6826.079s] covered with Brendan he believes what we
[6828.199s] believe that they will no they will no
[6830.48s] longer be limited in their ability to do
[6833.4s] BuyBacks because they can&#39;t get us uh
[6835.88s] they they can&#39;t get their cash outside
[6837.84s] of China uh now they&#39;ll be able to buy
[6841.4s] on the southbound connect and so they
[6843.76s] won&#39;t have to issue these convertible
[6846.04s] preper preferreds and then buy them back
[6847.88s] to be anti-dilutive so they can get cash
[6849.76s] out of the country uh out of the country
[6852.32s] cash they can now just buy stock on the
[6855.44s] southbound stock connect uh once that
[6857.88s] goes through and that&#39;s going to enable
[6859.56s] them to do unlimited BuyBacks to the
[6861.36s] extent that they want is limited to the
[6863.4s] extent that they can access cash even
[6865.719s] though they have unlimited amounts of
[6867.36s] cash in China they had trouble with the
[6869.96s] amount of cash they had outside of China
[6871.88s] that&#39;s no longer going to be an
[6873.88s] issue uh quote we&#39;ve started to replace
[6876.36s] a portion of alibaba&#39;s ESOP incentives
[6878.48s] with long-term cash incentives for our
[6880.48s] employees start starting last quarter
[6882.079s] these cash incentives will be reflected
[6883.56s] as costs while it will change compens
[6885.48s] lower adjusted eida it will also result
[6887.679s] in less ESOP delution in the future that
[6890.04s] is huge ladies and gentlemen uh uh also
[6893.84s] as far as Alibaba Cloud we are confident
[6897.48s] that revenue from external customers
[6899.52s] will return to double digit growth in
[6901.0s] the second half of the fiscal year with
[6902.92s] gradual acceleration thereafter this is
[6905.28s] becoming a growth company again ladies
[6906.96s] and gentlemen and it&#39;s priced like a
[6909.04s] cigar butt and that&#39;s going to change
[6911.04s] and when it changes and rates it&#39;s going
[6912.8s] to be very very quick expecting double
[6914.8s] digit Revenue in Cloud accelerate moving
[6918.079s] forward uh the other thing is the
[6920.239s] analysts are like aren&#39;t you seeing a
[6921.52s] Slowdown cool qu what we see certainly
[6924.159s] among our own cloud customers is that
[6926.48s] their AI budgets for this year are
[6928.76s] higher significantly higher than they
[6931.44s] were last year any Enterprise that is
[6933.52s] digitized and relies on digitization
[6935.8s] must be investing it has to be investing
[6938.199s] in AI all the industry is now uh that
[6941.28s] are using AI are leveraging it to
[6943.04s] enhance their competitiveness and
[6945.28s] efficiency so any Enterprise that&#39;s in
[6948.239s] any way digitally Reliant will certainly
[6951.32s] not scale down its investment in AI
[6953.719s] because to do so would impair their own
[6956.239s] competitiveness and efficiency so that&#39;s
[6958.52s] a clear Trend we&#39;re seeing and we are
[6960.639s] not seeing any kind of slowdown or
[6962.159s] softening this was a key reason we got
[6964.079s] involved with Alibaba to start with is
[6966.32s] their Cloud hegemony why the CFO sees
[6969.0s] free cash flow decline as temporary
[6971.52s] which we covered so he&#39;s basically
[6974.96s] saying um Let me let me explain this I I
[6979.28s] I it Bears such important repeating as
[6981.56s] it relates to free cash
[6983.84s] flow okay because for doing one p
[6986.56s] business on the one hand you are buying
[6988.239s] inventory from the vendor on the other
[6990.28s] hand you sell it and does the vendor
[6991.92s] normally give you a credit term like 60
[6993.679s] days or 90 days if you can make the
[6995.239s] inventory turnover I.E sell inventory
[6998.079s] within a short period of time shorter
[6999.76s] than the short sort of credit term
[7002.36s] you&#39;re given actually you are generating
[7004.719s] cash flow particularly if the size is
[7006.639s] going up you&#39;re generating positive cash
[7008.44s] flow on the contrary if you&#39;re reducing
[7010.28s] scale like they are with the direct
[7011.52s] sales business on purpose uh you will
[7013.84s] have outflow on working capital but is
[7016.56s] that is that a temporary impact to me I
[7019.4s] think this is
[7021.04s] relatively uh he says is this is this a
[7023.56s] permanent impact to me I think this is a
[7026.84s] relatively temporary impact during the
[7030.28s] process of reducing scale we will see
[7032.28s] this outflow but when the business size
[7034.56s] become stable we will no longer see
[7036.52s] these types of outflow okay so why are
[7040.0s] they doing the capex that was the second
[7041.679s] thing that imp impacted uh free cash
[7044.4s] flow and it&#39;s simply because quote we
[7046.92s] see a lot of demand a lot of unmet
[7048.88s] demand from many clients this is related
[7051.44s] to AI capex uh and you look at the
[7054.119s] pipeline those clients have you know
[7055.92s] there&#39;s going to be ongoing demand so
[7058.48s] whether it&#39;s training inference or API
[7060.36s] calls what we see we&#39;re making these
[7061.84s] kind of capex Investments quote as soon
[7064.0s] as we get a server up a server is
[7066.36s] instantly running at full capacity
[7069.239s] there&#39;s that kind of demand so we can
[7071.36s] expect to see a very high Roi over these
[7075.28s] next quarters because we&#39;re building
[7077.079s] compute power to meet existing demand
[7079.4s] and that new compute power coming online
[7082.599s] is getting instantly taken up and
[7085.119s] running at full capacity on day one huge
[7089.84s] ladies and gentlemen um so high single
[7093.52s] digit gmv growth double digit order
[7095.639s] growth uh this quarter some other other
[7098.84s] C we we covered most of them I just want
[7100.639s] to get some of these Stars here you can
[7102.719s] read this on your own the 88 VIP members
[7105.8s] that&#39;s like a paid subscription like
[7107.239s] Prime uh increase double digits
[7109.159s] year-over-year surpassing 42 million
[7111.159s] during the quarter pretty serious no one
[7113.4s] ever talks about it uh number of paying
[7115.52s] users using alibaba&#39;s Cloud AI platform
[7119.159s] has increased by over 200% quarter on
[7121.92s] quoter it&#39;s
[7123.719s] unbelievable
[7125.28s] um okay uh driven by double digit uh
[7128.96s] okay uh Cloud grew 6% driven by double
[7131.4s] digit public Cloud growth increasing
[7133.4s] adoption of AI related products AI
[7135.119s] related product Revenue continued to
[7136.76s] grow at triple digits year-over-year we
[7138.76s] continue to invest in customers and
[7140.28s] Technology particular AI infrastructure
[7142.36s] to increase Cloud adoption and for a the
[7144.48s] AI to maintain our our market share
[7147.52s] leadership uh significant double digit
[7151.04s] Revenue okay so we covered that uh aidc
[7155.52s] that&#39;s the international grew 32%
[7157.56s] year-over-year
[7160.52s] K now the log ICS 16% year-over-year
[7164.199s] local Services Group 12% year-over-year
[7167.119s] even the digital media grew 4%
[7169.44s] year-over-year
[7172.599s] all right let&#39;s see here some of these
[7175.119s] key stars and then we can move on we&#39;ve
[7177.079s] got still a lot to cover this week uh I
[7180.159s] was going to release Brendan&#39;s interview
[7182.92s] separately but then I just thought it
[7184.36s] would be confusing so we put it all in
[7187.079s] here uh notable okay Alibaba cloud has
[7190.44s] gained notable recognition as the cloud
[7192.04s] service provider of choice for
[7193.92s] AI uh according to recently released
[7197.199s] Gartner which is the industry standard
[7199.92s] uh Magic for data science and machine
[7202.199s] learning platforms report Alibaba cloud
[7204.4s] has been mentioned as the only Asia
[7206.599s] based cloud service provider among
[7209.239s] Global
[7210.56s] players
[7212.199s] uh code gener while enhancing s 27
[7215.44s] language number paying users on Alibaba
[7217.28s] Cloud AI platform increased over 200%
[7220.36s] covered all this covered this
[7222.56s] covered that
[7224.079s] okay uh our focus on enhancing user
[7229.48s] experience by offering quality products
[7230.88s] at attractive prices with great service
[7232.44s] led to stabilizing market share of tbal
[7235.079s] and t-all group as we return the
[7236.599s] business to the growth trajectory the
[7239.28s] cloud business achieve positive Revenue
[7240.76s] momentum driven by public cloud and AI
[7242.4s] related products maintain our we
[7244.36s] continue to invest to maintain our
[7245.48s] Market
[7247.679s] leadership we invest for growth in our
[7249.84s] Core Business while reducing losses in
[7251.36s] other business to operating efficiency
[7252.88s] which they did a good job that&#39;s why the
[7254.159s] sell side was so happy uh 5.8 billion of
[7256.96s] shares late uh repurchases underscores
[7260.28s] our confidence in business
[7264.04s] Outlook all right
[7271.119s] um okay
[7273.96s] next increase covered
[7277.159s] that I just don&#39;t want to miss anything
[7279.4s] because there&#39;s so many important points
[7281.0s] in what happened
[7282.88s] talked about the reversals look at these
[7285.92s] business units Top Line every single
[7288.56s] one China Commerce up 1% the direct
[7291.92s] sales they&#39;re winding down on purpose as
[7293.84s] we discussed the uh wholesale up 16% the
[7297.679s] overall if they weren&#39;t proactively
[7300.119s] turning that down I think it was like
[7302.28s] high mid single digit growth uh Cloud
[7305.159s] intelligence up 6% you know and then you
[7308.079s] just go line by line every single unit
[7310.28s] is up every single unit is up that&#39;s
[7312.719s] what we call a turnaround ladies and
[7314.0s] gentlemen that&#39;s why turnarounds are so
[7315.36s] critical what you need is Cash on the
[7317.36s] balance sheet and uh or options to pay
[7320.199s] down debt they don&#39;t have any of those
[7321.76s] problems and they&#39;re actually
[7322.92s] reaccelerating so they&#39;re like late
[7324.679s] stage turnaround now they&#39;re into growth
[7327.199s] re acceleration can go through all those
[7330.88s] just trying to make sure that I didn&#39;t
[7332.8s] miss any key things I wanted to cover
[7337.159s] here covered a lot of them with Brendan
[7340.4s] still have 84 billion dollars worth of
[7343.119s] cash by the way net cash whatever it is
[7345.88s] 65 billion I think they got 20 billion
[7348.44s] of debt uh they called the employees
[7351.0s] which we covered for another
[7353.119s] stabilization uh triple digit growth we
[7355.52s] covered
[7361.36s] that through intensive R&amp;D investment we
[7363.76s] aim to sustain profitable growth while
[7365.28s] establishing ourselves as a leading
[7366.52s] Cloud as a leading cloud provider for AI
[7368.76s] with healthy profitability and market
[7370.32s] share leadership
[7372.599s] uh profit 32% year on
[7379.52s] year okay so in conclusion our strategic
[7382.079s] focus is twofold enhancing operational
[7383.92s] efficiency across all business segments
[7385.679s] while on the other hand actively
[7386.84s] investing in the key markets to drive
[7388.599s] quality growth in scale with the goal of
[7390.28s] achieving more substantial profitability
[7392.04s] at scale in the
[7393.679s] future um winning the Mind share of our
[7398.119s] consumers purchased 630 million ordinary
[7402.159s] Shares are 77 million ads for a total of
[7404.679s] 5.8 billion 2.3% net
[7411.079s] reduction we talked about the long-term
[7413.4s] cash incentives this is a big
[7416.36s] deal increasing investment led to better
[7419.04s] consumer retention increased the
[7420.4s] purchase frequency and positive feedback
[7422.119s] regarding overall shopping
[7423.96s] experience uh
[7426.44s] consolid okay Cloud We Believe
[7430.44s] strengthen our Market leadership
[7435.079s] 4% okay increasing this
[7438.4s] investment okay yeah Solutions all right
[7442.239s] so you can go through this line by
[7446.48s] line stream okay now as the market share
[7450.199s] stabilizes what we certainly see in this
[7451.8s] quarter we can start to accelerate the
[7453.36s] pace of our monetization efforts that&#39;s
[7455.239s] what that CMR was the margins the the
[7457.48s] volumes are growing like crazy the
[7459.119s] margins now are going to re accelerate
[7461.239s] they can start to do monetization now
[7462.92s] that they&#39;ve stabilized the ship uh
[7464.8s] there are a few factors you&#39;ll have to
[7465.96s] look at first the various new products
[7468.36s] we&#39;ve launched including live streaming
[7470.48s] uh including the uh R&amp;B 10 billion
[7473.4s] subsidy program which resulted in higher
[7475.4s] user return and high and return to
[7478.639s] platforms and high user repurchase rates
[7481.559s] but it&#39;s going to take a bit of time to
[7482.719s] roll out the new monetization approaches
[7484.32s] and products for them to gain traction
[7486.48s] new advertising product we&#39;re
[7489.119s] introducing uh the first me
[7493.84s] okay so first they got the traffic
[7496.199s] second a sufficient number of
[7497.44s] advertising takeen apart covered
[7500.559s] that they talk about the 60 basis points
[7503.88s] on all transactions starting in
[7505.32s] September that&#39;s huge uh hundreds of
[7508.239s] millions to the bottom
[7512.119s] line go looking long run
[7518.679s] AI okay so they&#39;re aiming to
[7522.159s] get the approval from shareholders and
[7524.4s] get it completed before the end of
[7525.76s] August which means it uh the Chinese
[7528.28s] could be able to start to buy Alibaba
[7530.679s] stock as soon as early
[7533.32s] September
[7541.079s] um so half of their Cloud growth is
[7543.88s] going to
[7546.28s] be driven by AI
[7549.239s] products uh versus the CPU U stuff uh
[7555.28s] anyting certainly got that so there&#39;s
[7559.4s] just so much good detail in
[7564.04s] here secondly the software service Fe
[7566.719s] will take ah software service fee will
[7570.0s] also help on the take rate few other
[7573.679s] short measures as well so these are the
[7575.599s] things we&#39;ve currently been why we
[7577.559s] started to do it because we see growth
[7579.76s] back on the gmv and we see the sign of
[7582.28s] stabilizing market share so they could
[7585.0s] only charge this if they had confidence
[7587.199s] that they&#39;ve started to regain share and
[7589.159s] they&#39;re back on a growth trajectory you
[7590.719s] know you don&#39;t raise prices on Merchants
[7594.8s] uh if you think you&#39;re the sick the the
[7598.52s] ship is sinking you only do that when
[7600.679s] you&#39;re back to growth and that&#39;s that&#39;s
[7602.28s] where they
[7605.84s] are okay
[7609.04s] uh I think the reason clearly a very
[7612.04s] strong
[7614.079s] backlog continue investing simply
[7616.48s] because we see a lot of demand okay we
[7619.76s] expect to continue to be investing in AI
[7621.52s] capex at the same Pace simply because we
[7623.719s] see a lot of demand a lot of unmet
[7625.28s] demand from many clients and you look at
[7626.84s] the pipeline those clients have you know
[7628.239s] there&#39;s going to be ongoing
[7631.32s] demand okay we covered that all right
[7633.719s] fear and greed at 51% 51 versus which is
[7638.199s] neutral despite the huge runup in the
[7640.0s] markets the other thing though is the
[7642.079s] sentiment survey which is only like 300
[7644.559s] people by the way um a a sentiment is
[7648.32s] showing very very bullish and beares
[7650.84s] have not g gone down doesn&#39;t mean it has
[7653.639s] to reverse right away our base case has
[7655.88s] been that we remain strong into early
[7659.719s] September by the rumor s the news on the
[7661.8s] cut should be the seasonality so does
[7665.04s] that mean we sell everything because we
[7666.84s] know volatility is coming no I think
[7669.0s] what&#39;s going to happen is you know some
[7670.4s] of the things we&#39;ve been doing like smtc
[7672.4s] we took profits at like on the stock was
[7674.44s] around
[7675.84s] 75% um and the options were
[7678.239s] multi-baggers as well couple others uh C
[7682.36s] we took profits on uh some other names
[7685.639s] that we don&#39;t talk about a lot that our
[7687.119s] clients benefit from uh where their
[7689.719s] space so you know we are things that
[7692.44s] have gotten anywhere in the realm of
[7696.199s] near fully valued in the short term
[7698.96s] we&#39;ve been harvesting cash either red
[7701.52s] deploying it uh or we&#39;ll start to hold
[7704.48s] some cash as we get closer and closer to
[7706.44s] that first cut and then we may put on a
[7708.48s] couple of tactical shorts but there&#39;s
[7709.92s] enough cheap awesome opportunity stick
[7712.199s] stuff in the market right now that we&#39;re
[7715.44s] willing to buy even ahead of volatility
[7717.8s] as if we can predict volatility I mean
[7719.44s] we&#39;re just going by statistical
[7721.0s] Advantage uh and we&#39;ll we&#39;ll cover some
[7723.32s] of that in the charts in a second but um
[7727.4s] no it doesn&#39;t mean this is not a risk on
[7730.28s] riskof gu guing game we own quality
[7733.119s] businesses we&#39;ll ride any volatility
[7734.92s] through but we may if if we get a little
[7737.52s] more strength into early to
[7739.88s] mid-september when everyone who&#39;s been
[7742.199s] skeptical the whole way up just starts
[7743.639s] buying like crazy that&#39;s when we can put
[7746.119s] on some tactical shorts maybe raise a
[7748.28s] little cash maybe to add some to some
[7750.679s] positions that are down uh and take
[7752.8s] advantage and then after the election I
[7754.719s] think we get a yearend rally as we
[7756.639s] talked about uh on some of the segments
[7760.76s] so
[7762.159s] that&#39;s that on the call we went into how
[7764.48s] to reach Brendan aharn on Twitter his
[7767.719s] China last
[7769.079s] night.com uh and of course his
[7771.8s] ETF um next let&#39;s go into the
[7775.719s] charts some of the data we talked about
[7778.599s] the now everything is aligned um for the
[7782.119s] FED there&#39;s no excuse for them not to
[7783.719s] cut in September the only question is 25
[7785.719s] or 50 right now the Market&#39;s pricing in
[7787.96s] 25 but the CPI came in fine rent&#39;s a
[7791.96s] little sticky but it&#39;s rolling over uh
[7794.92s] new vehicle uh price is coming down
[7797.88s] again these are the things we want to
[7799.44s] see we want to see a race to the bottom
[7801.44s] in terms of margins for the OEM and uh
[7804.719s] and then uh flooding the market with
[7806.92s] volumes as the incentives come the
[7808.48s] people come back uh and you can see
[7811.04s] these
[7812.32s] different
[7813.96s] um indicators interestingly enough the
[7817.28s] worldwide box office year-to date ladies
[7819.76s] and gentlemen what are the top top two
[7821.719s] films they&#39;re Disney inside out to
[7823.599s] Deadpool and Wolverine uh was actually
[7826.199s] the largest R-rated movie box office in
[7829.559s] the history of box offices so the idea
[7832.719s] that no one&#39;s going to the movie
[7833.8s] theaters is apparently inaccurate
[7836.48s] Microsoft has accelerated heavy
[7838.28s] investments in AI reason I put this
[7840.159s] chart is so you can see the magnitude
[7842.04s] and you can see why that shift from
[7844.52s] magnificent 7 to 493 is happening and is
[7847.559s] going to continue to happen uh not
[7849.52s] because they&#39;re going to crash or
[7850.719s] anything but because their margins are
[7853.0s] going to be crimped from all their
[7854.239s] investment and their earnings growth is
[7856.36s] decelerating from 50% to 20% doesn&#39;t
[7859.079s] mean it&#39;s going out of business it just
[7860.52s] means that the relative value is going
[7863.04s] to be outside those groups in terms of
[7865.32s] outperformance and we covered some of
[7867.04s] that
[7868.36s] Bond Bond and Equity Universe um this is
[7871.84s] really
[7872.679s] interesting the value of all Global
[7875.119s] bonds and stocks is 255 trillion the
[7878.0s] value of all Global bonds is 130
[7880.0s] trillion the value all Global stocks is
[7883.119s] 125 trillion so when you have a company
[7886.28s] like you know apple or Nvidia get up to
[7891.44s] these four and five trillion dollar
[7893.4s] valuations you know when you back it out
[7895.719s] and you just measure it relative to GDP
[7898.48s] and measure it relative to uh the global
[7902.44s] value of every stock on Earth you can
[7904.36s] start to see how some of these have
[7906.0s] gotten a little bit ahead of their skis
[7908.559s] and if you zoom out as we always say you
[7911.719s] can discern and take advantage of those
[7914.88s] um opportunities to stay away so or or
[7919.44s] uh trim you know as you know we&#39;ve done
[7922.44s] uh well before any of this uh Yen
[7925.96s] dislocation and all that stuff was
[7927.8s] happening Financial assets are worth
[7930.76s] 233% of global GDP they peaked in 2019
[7934.92s] at 270 billion wor 270% of global
[7939.76s] GDP the value of Wall Street relative to
[7942.88s] the value of Main Street is almost back
[7944.96s] at record
[7946.639s] highs
[7949.4s] um negative yielding debt has dropped
[7952.04s] from 18 trillion to zero in the last
[7954.48s] four years so there was a lot of
[7956.639s] negative yielding debt if you think of
[7959.119s] jgbs uh even um real yields on
[7963.28s] treasuries were negative and now that&#39;s
[7965.8s] back to more normalized levels uh top
[7969.04s] five stocks in the S&amp;P 500 peaked at 29%
[7971.84s] of the market in July of 2024 we said it
[7974.8s] was bananas that has now rolled over
[7977.44s] magnificent 7 reached market cap reached
[7981.679s] a record high of $17 trillion in July
[7985.4s] 2024 when we were getting out of uh
[7988.719s] Amazon getting out of Google that we
[7991.559s] bought in October 2022 when no one
[7993.719s] wanted it and you can see that that
[7996.119s] rolling
[7997.96s] over um 17 trillion again you say wow
[8001.32s] $17 trillion well they&#39;re great
[8002.92s] companies okay are they worth one fifth
[8007.32s] of the entire world of global equities
[8010.44s] like there are 10,000 Global equities
[8012.8s] let&#39;s just say there&#39;s probably more
[8014.52s] call it
[8015.4s] 12,000 uh Global equities these are you
[8018.0s] know five stocks should be 20% of all
[8021.679s] the value of all of the markets in the
[8023.8s] world it&#39;s a little extreme and these
[8026.28s] extremes always get corrected as you see
[8028.679s] over and over and over so they get
[8031.079s] corrected in part by the others growing
[8033.4s] and in part by them either staying
[8035.679s] static or coming in a little bit to more
[8038.159s] normalized valuations uh Tech Telecom
[8041.559s] Healthcare peaked at 45% of global
[8043.44s] equities in July 2024 we haven&#39;t seen
[8046.52s] that level since uh
[8050.119s] 22000 okay so that that&#39;s where you want
[8053.239s] to be where you want to avoid uh you got
[8055.36s] to pay attention to stuff like that uh
[8057.88s] this is the cross asset returns from
[8061.28s] 2010 to 2024 and the thing the reason
[8063.84s] I&#39;d like to show this uh and boy you
[8066.84s] guys are getting a lot of value per
[8068.239s] dollar this week I hope you&#39;re drinking
[8070.0s] coffee to catch keep up with me here
[8073.719s] um it the reason I show these is because
[8076.76s] what you can see is the last shall be
[8078.84s] first is a very consistent theme just
[8080.679s] look at gold gold was on top in 2010 by
[8083.76s] 2013 it was at the bottom by 2016 it was
[8086.96s] back on top by 2020 it was way on top
[8090.199s] then it collapsed into 2021 now it&#39;s
[8092.679s] reisen everyone wants gold it&#39;s going to
[8094.639s] be back on the bottom in the next few
[8096.159s] years no it can&#39;t be on the bottom
[8098.079s] central banks are buying it central
[8099.92s] banks have been the biggest Contra
[8101.239s] indicator since the biggest since the
[8103.079s] beginning of time so if you just do the
[8105.96s] opposite so they&#39;ll they&#39;ll they&#39;ll buy
[8108.199s] more and then it&#39;ll change same same if
[8110.28s] you look at these cross asset returns uh
[8113.159s] from in the 2000s you couldn&#39;t give away
[8116.52s] emerging markets in 2000 by 2003 it was
[8119.36s] the top performing asset did 56% that
[8122.239s] that year the next year it did 26% the
[8124.8s] next year it did 34% this is exactly
[8127.199s] where we are ladies and gentlemen we are
[8129.079s] going to be um finding ourselves in a
[8133.0s] position where they start to
[8134.76s] outperform two years ago they two years
[8137.88s] ago they did1 19 -2 last two years
[8141.079s] they&#39;re up double digits they&#39;re just
[8142.76s] getting started that&#39;s what you saw in
[8144.8s] 200 2001 and 2002 they came out of the
[8146.92s] doldrums and then they made it to the
[8148.599s] top which is probably next year um but
[8151.8s] just look at these patterns that&#39;s the
[8153.679s] one thing that I&#39;m very good at is
[8155.48s] pattern recognition and
[8158.44s] um
[8161.44s] um you look at every single decade here
[8164.559s] was another decade everyone says like oh
[8167.32s] you know us exceptionalism I agree us
[8170.04s] exceptionalism that doesn&#39;t mean that
[8173.04s] International stocks should underperform
[8175.0s] forever and the answer is they didn&#39;t
[8177.04s] they outperformed in the80s believe it
[8179.84s] or not remember they were down on the
[8181.599s] vulker era then by 83 21% 12% 25% 10%
[8187.559s] 22% 40% 65% I mean it was the best
[8192.08s] performing asset in the 80s then the 90
[8194.08s] it took the break because the uh Tech
[8197.319s] took over and then in the 2000s it had
[8199.599s] its biggest run ever from 2001 to 2007
[8201.8s] so what have we had we&#39;ve had the same
[8203.88s] thing we had it run in 2020 take a break
[8207.679s] due to the tech Mania from uh the last
[8211.28s] 10 years and now it&#39;ll be back this 10
[8213.12s] years you watch what happens it&#39;s
[8215.519s] history doesn&#39;t rhyme but it does repeat
[8218.319s] look at the 70s what Emerging Markets
[8220.08s] did top of the Shelf every single year I
[8223.24s] mean 14% 36% 30% in
[8227.16s] 1973
[8228.719s] 13.5% when the US market collapsed 26%
[8232.439s] it was down 15 then it was back up back
[8234.559s] up back up top of the chart these will
[8237.04s] be back ladies and gentlemen um all
[8239.76s] right so you get the point crowded
[8243.96s] trades uh you can look here too where
[8248.16s] the dividend yields are by
[8251.04s] sector uh energy is a big dividend yield
[8254.2s] as rates cut people are going to want
[8255.84s] dividends financials reats utilities
[8258.559s] have already run up ahead of it uh price
[8261.599s] to earnings where are the lowest price
[8263.16s] to earnings ratios
[8266.479s] energy uh
[8269.519s] financials re
[8271.84s] utilities trailing price to earnings
[8274.2s] Price to Book
[8276.24s] ratios Etc so burden yourself with data
[8279.24s] that&#39;s all I can suggest uh it works the
[8282.599s] bull bear indicator is not yet at the
[8284.359s] extreme bullishness level where you want
[8286.16s] to sell that&#39;s from Bank of America
[8288.2s] restaurant spending is falling a little
[8289.92s] bit you&#39;re seeing that in the lowest end
[8292.359s] of the consumer uh retail sales though
[8295.04s] is still strong because in
[8297.08s] aggregate um people are spending I I
[8300.599s] think it was like the top 20% does 50% I
[8303.92s] I don&#39;t know there&#39;s so so much data but
[8306.599s] yes there are Crosswinds the FED does
[8308.04s] need to cut it&#39;s not all roses and green
[8310.319s] shoots uh but if they act quickly enough
[8312.479s] like they did in 95 all will be well on
[8315.28s] that front here
[8318.24s] is the S&amp;P forward returns 13 26 39 and
[8323.519s] 52 weeks after the Vick spikes above 45
[8327.519s] which it did a few weeks ago and you see
[8329.88s] on average a year out it&#39;s up
[8332.399s] 14% every period whether it&#39;s 4 we 8
[8334.96s] week on average it&#39;s up and that&#39;s what
[8337.16s] we&#39;re
[8341.359s] seeing
[8344.08s] next returns were positive when the
[8346.08s] First Rate cut did not prede a
[8350.519s] recession and you can see six months
[8352.719s] later so even if the market goes down a
[8355.12s] little bit after the first cut what
[8356.479s] they&#39;re trying to say here is uh 3
[8359.719s] months and 6 months later on average
[8361.479s] it&#39;s up pretty materially over time and
[8365.12s] if there&#39;s no recession which at 2% GDP
[8367.88s] growth it&#39;s going to be tough to get two
[8369.16s] quarters of negative GDP unless they do
[8371.16s] something stupid and they don&#39;t cut then
[8373.28s] like you&#39;re going to have deflation uh
[8375.84s] and a huge problem but um leaving that
[8378.2s] aside dividend yield is where the action
[8380.0s] is at inexpensive versus history the
[8382.88s] cheapest it&#39;s been since 2002 I
[8385.359s] reemphasize these things because they&#39;re
[8388.08s] important and if you get the themes you
[8389.8s] can make a lot of money again go to
[8391.96s] hedge fund tips.com click on terms this
[8395.96s] is all opinion not advice uh we deal
[8399.24s] exclusively with accredited investors
[8401.12s] talk to your financial advisor don&#39;t do
[8403.12s] anything don&#39;t make any decisions don&#39;t
[8405.479s] take any actions um all right Advantage
[8408.76s] dissipating so here is the earnings
[8411.12s] growth that we continue to emphasize
[8413.64s] with the
[8416.96s] Magnificent
[8418.84s] Seven earnings growth
[8421.479s] from
[8422.28s] 34% to 29 to 18 and then the
[8427.56s] unmagnify from -4% in 2023 to plus 6.5%
[8433.56s] this year to 13.5% next year and then
[8436.359s] look at small caps this is awesome 2023
[8440.04s] - 12.2% this year plus
[8442.68s] 7.3% next year plus
[8447.64s] 37.6% so if you&#39;re skeptical about small
[8450.2s] caps because because they had a little
[8451.16s] sell down because of the Yen nonsense uh
[8454.24s] you&#39;re going to miss the boat ladies and
[8455.76s] gentlemen it&#39;s going to move bigly in
[8458.64s] our view small small size factor is
[8461.6s] historically cheap versus large size
[8463.319s] Factor growth versus value expensive on
[8466.359s] a book value basis you can see growth is
[8468.56s] like obscenely it&#39;s more expensive than
[8471.08s] it was at the Tech rec Peak uh value
[8474.12s] versus growth valuations remain well
[8476.04s] below historic
[8478.439s] average uh housing starts that&#39;s a
[8480.84s] function of rates Philadelphia fed
[8482.359s] manufacturing that was weak that&#39;s why
[8483.72s] the FED needs to
[8485.04s] move uh buying
[8487.88s] conditions U UK retail sales are re
[8490.92s] accelerating that&#39;s been a core part of
[8492.52s] our
[8494.2s] theme of the UK getting back on
[8497.28s] track uh S&amp;P historical performance post
[8501.08s] Jackson Hall so they speak
[8503.0s] tomorrow uh and the only time they
[8505.56s] screwed it up was in 2022 last year they
[8508.24s] got it right 2020 I mean that was a
[8510.8s] strange year so on balance it tends to
[8513.359s] go up this yellow
[8516.12s] line next is the Fed balance sheet has
[8518.439s] come down quite a bit I mean that&#39;s
[8520.0s] almost
[8521.64s] uh two
[8523.8s] trillion that&#39;s pretty good uh this is
[8526.56s] probably where they&#39;ll end they not
[8528.0s] going to be able to reduce a lot more of
[8529.24s] this cycle but uh they did better than
[8531.88s] most people would expect without causing
[8533.479s] a recession expectation of losing one&#39;s
[8536.12s] job at a record high in New York fed
[8539.12s] survey uh so so that&#39;s that so you know
[8543.08s] people are on edge fed fed needs to fix
[8545.72s] that in the next few weeks long-term
[8547.68s] inflation expectations at lowest since
[8549.479s] early 2022 that&#39;s another thing that
[8552.16s] gives them cover earnings growth by
[8554.439s] sector that&#39;s for this year com services
[8557.16s] and Tech were the highest uh energy was
[8559.6s] the lowest next year is expected to be
[8561.52s] healthc care uh Tech materials coming
[8565.68s] back from the dead from negative to
[8567.479s] positive so there might be some
[8568.76s] opportunity and materials we
[8571.08s] Alamar
[8573.24s] ALB um tiny position starting there
[8576.479s] where there&#39;s space uh not a huge
[8578.84s] position super conviction yet and then
[8582.64s] um anyway we&#39;re looking in that space
[8585.04s] and
[8585.35s] [Music]
[8586.96s] then uh Staples which is priced huge is
[8591.319s] uh is going to have
[8592.6s] lower so there&#39;s a lot to do industrial
[8595.52s] 16% earnings growth there&#39;s going to be
[8597.16s] a lot there people are starting new
[8599.6s] businesses at extraordinary rates you
[8601.279s] can see here
[8605.319s] 420,000 of late pricey Hedges everyone
[8608.8s] wanted to buy Hedges when the when the
[8612.68s] stock market was in the whole two-year
[8614.52s] high for demand and price uh sold to you
[8617.88s] and uh they couldn&#39;t get enough at the
[8619.88s] bottom and they won&#39;t want them at the
[8622.08s] top so when we&#39;re buying tactical Hedges
[8624.56s] sometime in September uh they&#39;ll be the
[8626.88s] cheapest that they&#39;ve been no one will
[8628.8s] want them everyone will think it&#39;s it&#39;s
[8630.52s] going straight to the moon and uh and
[8632.92s] then they&#39;ll come in handy Q2 had a
[8634.84s] boost in both VC deal volume and cash
[8637.0s] rage so that&#39;s uh rising from the A
[8639.359s] Phoenix Rising From the Ashes pricey
[8643.68s] issuance PN uh C Insurance monthly is
[8647.88s] starting to come down finally according
[8650.6s] to these charts rents we&#39;ve covered
[8652.6s] they&#39;re coming down uh down rounds as a
[8655.64s] share of all us VC deals are still
[8659.319s] accelerating so all those shitty deals
[8661.439s] done in 200121 with free money they&#39;re
[8665.04s] down rounding all day long and uh
[8667.6s] startup shutdowns are rising at the
[8669.279s] fastest Pace Rising like crazy they
[8671.479s] should I couldn&#39;t believe the crazy you
[8673.96s] know what that was going on back then I
[8676.56s] could believe it I just avoided it share
[8678.6s] BuyBacks by region BuyBacks are at
[8681.0s] record highs that&#39;s another support
[8682.76s] under the market uh portfolio and
[8685.399s] Benchmark Waits For The Magnificent for
[8687.24s] core
[8688.279s] funds uh so core funds are slightly
[8690.84s] below index weight is 32% most managers
[8693.76s] at 22% so they got smashed in August we
[8696.88s] did not uh August has been unbelievable
[8699.92s] July was great uh Japan as the highest
[8703.68s] debt burden relative to GDP UK is second
[8707.479s] us is fourth you can look at that table
[8709.92s] there monetary policy viewed as the most
[8712.52s] restrictive since October
[8715.72s] 2008 reemphasizing this why because the
[8719.0s] last time that managers believed that
[8721.56s] policy was this restrictive the FED
[8723.359s] acted and it was the bottom of equities
[8726.04s] so look at these four points March 2020
[8729.319s] we were one of the few people pounding
[8730.8s] the table to buy you can review our
[8732.88s] market watch article I believe it was
[8734.52s] March 25th it&#39;s on our website of 2020
[8738.16s] we were saying we are buyers in the hole
[8740.64s] and um and it proved to be the bottom
[8742.479s] two days later literally it was
[8744.399s] unbelievable um and then
[8747.88s] um April 2021 OCT 2008 you can go
[8751.56s] through there a surge in global
[8753.76s] liquidity is brewing promising a
[8755.92s] potential economic upswing this is a big
[8759.319s] deal ladies and gentlemen and
[8762.479s] um it does support you know first off
[8765.359s] you got the 30 billion dollar of fed
[8767.88s] repurchases two you&#39;ve got the most
[8770.359s] amount of central banks easing uh since
[8773.359s] the the bottoms in 2020 2009 Etc we&#39;ve
[8777.12s] covered some of that data in recent
[8778.52s] weeks so this liquidity surge is not
[8781.319s] something to be taken lightly which is
[8783.439s] why we&#39;ve been bullish like crazy since
[8786.319s] that fourth quarter of 2022 when
[8788.479s] everyone was hiding under a rock and uh
[8791.6s] so there you go and and it looks like
[8794.16s] we&#39;ve got a lot of Runway to go uh
[8797.0s] Capital spending quarterly so this is
[8799.0s] what&#39;s going to cause the margin
[8800.08s] compression Amazon Microsoft alphabet
[8802.439s] meta when you can visualize and see at
[8804.439s] at record highs there&#39;s no way they
[8807.04s] retain um uh margins and then you see
[8811.08s] storage capacity in exabytes the demand
[8814.319s] is greater than the
[8816.08s] supply the same is going to be true for
[8818.2s] Alibaba in Asia uh TSX for the Canadians
[8821.8s] the Looney is picking up pace as we&#39;ve
[8823.68s] talked about but the TSX trades at a
[8825.96s] record discount to the S&amp;P 500 not seen
[8829.2s] since 2001 I&#39;d be looking for Canadian
[8832.319s] stocks I think some of the uh materials
[8834.8s] plays and some of the energy plays are
[8837.16s] going to start to be home runs there so
[8839.279s] got to start to look at some the
[8840.359s] Canadian stuff um TSX is finally out of
[8844.279s] an earnings recession you can see here
[8846.359s] from negative earnings growth to
[8848.359s] positive uh preliminary payrolls through
[8851.72s] March this was the big chart of the week
[8853.88s] as we had been telling you I mean it&#39;s
[8855.76s] like tomorrow&#39;s newspaper today
[8857.08s] listening to this podcast sometimes um
[8859.88s] and it&#39;s not because we have a crystal
[8861.04s] ball it&#39;s because we just pay attention
[8862.439s] to data and recognize patterns
[8864.279s] consistently and you can too uh after
[8867.68s] you do it for 20 years I mean it just
[8869.399s] comes naturally after 20 years I guess
[8871.6s] golf&#39;s the same way it&#39;s like I go out
[8873.399s] and have a blowup round and and then I&#39;m
[8875.24s] like oh wait I&#39;ve only been playing two
[8876.72s] years uh and I&#39;m like why you know why
[8879.16s] aren I scratch or whatever and it&#39;s just
[8881.04s] like no because you suck you&#39;re new and
[8884.16s] uh you know and then the next day you&#39;re
[8885.96s] going to go out and shoot an 81 and you
[8888.68s] know feel better about yourself and uh
[8890.8s] and keep keep at it so that&#39;s the way it
[8892.64s] goes but after 20 years I figure I&#39;ll be
[8894.52s] pretty damn good at it um all right less
[8897.04s] robust job growth
[8901.319s] if they don&#39;t cut bigly in the next few
[8903.319s] meetings meaning 50 to 75 basis points
[8906.319s] before the end of the year they&#39;re just
[8907.64s] blind or stupid uh I think that it&#39;s
[8910.96s] unequivocal they&#39;re going to start easy
[8913.359s] with the 25 and then Accelerate from
[8916.6s] there as needed and temper but this was
[8920.439s] I mean you know when I think about how
[8922.6s] off these numbers were and it was it was
[8924.76s] bothering me because it&#39;s also what
[8927.6s] threw them off when inflation was
[8929.279s] roaring because because the jobs
[8931.52s] creation was uh under reported and now
[8935.68s] it&#39;s been over reported for the last
[8937.76s] year by almost a million jobs
[8945.12s] um this is this is something and you&#39;ve
[8948.439s] seen the rhetoric come out in the last
[8950.08s] few days from all these fed officials
[8951.52s] our focus is now on the jobs report
[8953.04s] because they&#39;re like wait there are a
[8954.399s] million jobs less than you report it&#39;s
[8956.439s] like if a public company reports $20 off
[8960.64s] their accounting is off the stock will
[8962.64s] sell down 30% if their financials are
[8964.56s] wrong this Bureau of Labor can get it
[8966.96s] wrong 12 months in a row by a million
[8969.16s] jobs and there&#39;s no penalty whatsoever
[8972.279s] it&#39;s really mind-boggling the penalty is
[8974.439s] the fed&#39;s been 300 basis points too
[8976.64s] restrictive than they should have been
[8978.319s] had they had the accurate data about the
[8980.279s] jobs reports so there you go let&#39;s move
[8983.56s] on to our sler stuff from RBC thanks to
[8986.6s] my buddy over
[8988.64s] there um let me just see if we have any
[8991.439s] more charts here okay fomc mentions of
[8994.52s] inflation are falling off a cliff of
[8996.72s] unemployment are rising so that&#39;s their
[8998.96s] dual mandate kicking in revision suggest
[9001.88s] more moderate payroll growth we covered
[9004.439s] that non-farm payroll growth revised
[9006.04s] down
[9008.12s] 88,000 um this is another chart of
[9010.64s] median size of new single family homes
[9012.76s] we&#39;ve talked about this for a year we
[9014.12s] said think levit town the houses are
[9016.08s] going to get smaller not everyone needs
[9017.439s] a starter home that&#39;s 6,000 square fet
[9020.0s] and that&#39;s changing and then finally
[9022.04s] here this is
[9025.96s] financials uh financials
[9030.16s] waiting in the S&amp;P 500 was 22% in 2007
[9034.52s] all this stuff reversed to the mean was
[9037.88s] at a low of 10% during the 2020 lows
[9040.399s] when we were pounding the table to buy
[9041.6s] Wells Fargo got a double in that and
[9044.16s] then
[9046.279s] um now it&#39;s reverting back to Norm but
[9048.76s] this has a lot of room to run I know we
[9050.439s] trimmed a bunch of our city and
[9053.319s] BAC um that we bought during that
[9055.92s] Regional B banking crisis and made it a
[9058.319s] really really nice trade on uh but we&#39;re
[9061.479s] we&#39;re looking to find ways to buy it
[9065.12s] back in and and the reason is hopefully
[9067.84s] in September October we&#39;ll get that
[9069.399s] chance and the reason is is because the
[9072.359s] m&amp;a and IPO cycle hasn&#39;t even begun so
[9075.0s] they&#39;re going to make money I just
[9077.08s] they&#39;ve had you know they basically
[9078.439s] doubled in a short period of time
[9080.8s] hit the window and then buy back down
[9084.04s] low and um and that&#39;s what we&#39;re going
[9086.439s] to hope to do uh Tech waiting as a
[9090.6s] percentage of the index we&#39;ve covered
[9092.16s] this back to 2,000
[9095.0s] highs it&#39;s uh it&#39;s not where you want to
[9097.84s] be but money market funds you know as
[9100.2s] equities go up as yields go down this
[9103.08s] money has to find a home and um just
[9105.72s] like it did in 200920 everyone got into
[9109.92s] money markets in
[9112.56s] fear and then it all came back into the
[9114.76s] market and you added 10 more years of a
[9116.76s] of a bull run
[9119.88s] uh develop Market government debt as a
[9122.92s] percentage of This Is Us debt to GDP
[9126.24s] we&#39;ve covered this highest debt to GDP
[9128.359s] since World War II had they get out of
[9130.12s] in World War II they just let inflation
[9132.319s] R run above Trend if they&#39;re smart they
[9134.52s] will let inflation run between 2 and 1
[9136.399s] half to 4% for the next 5 years and they
[9139.439s] act quickly enough and that&#39;s how you
[9141.16s] can inflate your way out of it that&#39;s
[9142.64s] how we did it in World War II we&#39;ll get
[9144.56s] the growth why because we got 72
[9146.279s] Millennials at Prime working and
[9148.08s] spending years average age 34 similar to
[9150.8s] China by the way that&#39;s why they&#39;re
[9151.92s] going to have one more parabolic run
[9153.76s] difference is we have a a a large
[9156.64s] generation after our Millennials the
[9158.319s] Chinese don&#39;t their toast five more
[9160.56s] years for China and then
[9162.359s] bye-bye um just like Japan from 85 to 89
[9167.279s] here&#39;s the sler charts just shows the uh
[9170.12s] S&amp;P hitting a little resistance
[9174.12s] here and then weekly this shows the
[9177.319s] September seasonality here so we had a
[9179.64s] strong
[9182.0s] August now the only corollary to this is
[9185.439s] that during election
[9188.52s] years um well no actually election years
[9191.52s] are in line with this it&#39;s shows
[9193.56s] strength till mid September then end of
[9194.96s] September is where you get the weakness
[9196.24s] early October you get weakness and then
[9197.84s] you get a recovery in
[9201.88s] um in late October into November I think
[9204.399s] this year might not be till November
[9205.84s] till you get election certainty unless
[9207.479s] it&#39;s just showing positively that one
[9209.52s] candidate is that far ahead this rebound
[9213.319s] looks like it has a little more to go uh
[9215.399s] and we could even hit new highs in
[9217.16s] September in late August September
[9219.279s] before we get defensive
[9222.439s] shortterm
[9224.0s] and what else do we have here we&#39;ve got
[9227.359s] the NASDAQ recovering back
[9230.24s] I think that that&#39;s got some room to
[9232.56s] go midcaps just breaking out we love
[9235.88s] that story We own a lot of midcaps small
[9238.319s] caps just coming off the mat this is
[9240.2s] going to be the whole theme for the next
[9241.6s] 18 months small caps this is just
[9243.439s] getting started and this is probably
[9245.439s] going to go from let&#39;s see 16 to 24800
[9249.479s] this probably goes to 3,200 on the
[9251.56s] Russell at least uh from where is it now
[9255.84s] 2000 so you know 50 plus% 60% over over
[9259.84s] the next 18
[9261.359s] months um which means some of those
[9263.439s] names are going to be up 34x or Cooper
[9265.319s] standard a lot more a lot more in our
[9268.64s] view um Tokyo Stock Exchange
[9272.439s] collapse uh it&#39;ll recover what&#39;s going
[9275.0s] to happen is they realize we can&#39;t raise
[9278.76s] when the FED is not offsetting the
[9280.52s] liquidity so as the FED starts to cut
[9282.96s] the bank of Japan will go back to hiking
[9286.04s] but it will have less of a detri it
[9288.279s] won&#39;t have the same shock on the of the
[9290.04s] world it may have the a continued shock
[9292.279s] on the Japanese equities but there was
[9294.8s] nothing there anyway so um you know it
[9298.439s] is what it
[9299.439s] is topics okay Japanese
[9303.56s] Yen that was such a nice move hang sang
[9306.76s] looks like it&#39;s starting to get going
[9311.52s] again so breakout check back push up
[9316.52s] 10-year yield all these things that
[9318.24s] we&#39;ve been talking about um we on that
[9321.68s] day that it got down to 375 was a Friday
[9324.04s] we took profits on TLT we would look to
[9326.84s] reload those if um this bounced back up
[9332.0s] in the short term and looking at some of
[9334.439s] the things like utilities and everything
[9336.52s] I don&#39;t know why I wouldn&#39;t be shocked
[9339.2s] if yields went back up a
[9342.24s] hair uh I can&#39;t tell you why maybe it&#39;s
[9345.279s] something they say
[9346.88s] tomorrow uh but that would probably be
[9350.479s] an opportunity to reload on that and and
[9352.92s] win again um but I&#39;m yeah even here
[9356.68s] looking at the 10-year yield it looks
[9358.08s] like it just wants to have a short-term
[9359.399s] counterbalance maybe back up to 28 418
[9363.279s] or something like that so um utilities
[9365.92s] will probably get hit on that dollar
[9368.24s] beautifully it&#39;ll have a counter Trend
[9369.84s] bounce maybe back up to 103 before it
[9371.92s] rolls back over Canadian dollar is
[9374.439s] starting to come off the mat like we had
[9376.6s] anticipated big move here
[9383.88s] copper probably starts to bounce China&#39;s
[9385.92s] coming
[9387.64s] back and gold people can&#39;t get enough so
[9390.399s] maybe you have a parabolic move to 2,800
[9393.0s] suck everyone in and then just roll it
[9395.08s] over again
[9398.04s] um okay so now we&#39;re doing things a
[9401.0s] little backwards let&#39;s cover some of the
[9402.319s] new stuff because we wanted to get to
[9403.6s] Brandon first China&#39;s Battle of the
[9405.8s] bonds has Supply surge adding X factors
[9408.279s] so they&#39;re going to issue a ton of bonds
[9409.6s] that will be stimulative Japan&#39;s economy
[9411.8s] bounces back supporting the case for
[9413.279s] more rate hikes that&#39;s coming in
[9415.16s] September after the FED Cuts alibaba&#39;s
[9417.319s] long awaited China stock link May
[9419.04s] provide timely boost here&#39;s the article
[9421.08s] talking about 20 plus billion Alibaba
[9423.52s] says its math specific AI model out
[9425.6s] performs Rivals alibaba&#39;s long awaited
[9428.24s] China stock link May provide timely
[9430.2s] boost China us to set up contact group
[9435.52s] for cases of financial stress so they&#39;re
[9437.96s] working together that&#39;s good news not
[9439.92s] bad news um this
[9443.8s] is Brendan&#39;s comments
[9446.5s] [Music]
[9448.24s] on some China government policy last
[9451.279s] week
[9453.08s] um oh article notes that the release
[9455.319s] from the third Plum quote pledged an
[9457.399s] incremental tilt towards consumer
[9459.08s] stimulus in what analysts saw as an
[9461.279s] official admission admission that
[9463.56s] previous toolkit was not working as
[9465.16s] intended so they they&#39;re getting it and
[9467.2s] Brendan really covered that well on the
[9470.24s] uh conversation we had earlier in the
[9472.359s] podcast China may let local governments
[9474.399s] sell bonds to buy homes so China
[9477.479s] regulator asks Banks to survey impact of
[9480.6s] stronger Yuan remember we talked about
[9482.68s] higher bond yields higher Yuan higher
[9485.479s] equities that&#39;s coming to a theater near
[9487.84s] you in China Chinese e-commerce Giants
[9490.319s] want your business and UT retail us
[9493.84s] retailers are losing it sales by Us
[9497.12s] sales by Chinese online platforms could
[9499.56s] sore to $40 billion in 2024 from 15
[9504.56s] billion last year um obviously teu is
[9509.08s] benefiting but so is
[9512.399s] Aliexpress bigly okay so that&#39;s that&#39;s a
[9515.72s] good thing to see uh number of overseas
[9518.399s] payment buyers Mount plus 30% year onye
[9520.92s] in the first half for Alibaba Lulu Lemon
[9523.88s] CEO Calvin McDonald buys up Disney stock
[9527.8s] ladies and gentlemen Disney stock the
[9530.52s] one that is getting zero value for
[9532.72s] having two of the biggest movies of the
[9534.76s] year uh PayPal Apple opens up payment
[9538.12s] options boosting PayPal stock this
[9540.72s] analyst sees long-term positives the
[9543.52s] game is on the turnaround is happening
[9545.56s] we love New Management
[9549.76s] stories speaking of New Management
[9552.8s] stories um Advanced Auto Parts the guy
[9556.0s] who ran HD Supply Advance reported today
[9559.439s] they sold the westpack business which is
[9561.359s] huge they got $1.5 billion 1.2 net of
[9566.24s] taxes they&#39;re going to pay down debt
[9568.68s] their comp store sales were up uh year
[9571.8s] onye they beat on the top line they
[9575.439s] missed a little bit on the bottom line
[9577.92s] they took their guidance down for this
[9579.52s] year which upset people but their comp
[9581.6s] stores Rose 4% year onye uh the guidance
[9585.64s] was a little weak the key here is
[9587.8s] they&#39;ve taken existential risk off the
[9589.84s] table by deleveraging the balance sheet
[9591.8s] they&#39;re holding their cor core business
[9593.68s] together and re accelerating earnings
[9595.24s] will be down a little bit this year um
[9598.08s] so all I&#39;m telling you and maybe we&#39;ll
[9600.359s] cover this one in a lot of detail I can
[9602.8s] just tell you this I was busier than a
[9605.399s] one-armed well let&#39;s see there&#39;s two one
[9607.8s] arm P paper hanger or one-legged guy in
[9610.72s] an ass kicking contest this morning from
[9613.08s] 79 when the stock was down
[9615.76s] 20% we brought we nearly doubled our
[9618.76s] position and brought our basis down to
[9621.439s] $53 uh $53 and change per share I&#39;m just
[9624.84s] looking at the aggregated portfolio so
[9627.76s] uh wherever there was room so that tells
[9629.68s] you everything you need does it doesn&#39;t
[9630.96s] mean it can&#39;t go to 40 it could go to 40
[9633.04s] I I
[9635.04s] literally the anyway the point is it&#39;s
[9638.319s] generating free cash flow It Now does
[9640.76s] not have existential risk it&#39;s got a
[9642.96s] great manager in there so whether it
[9644.84s] goes to 40 before it goes to 100 or it
[9646.92s] goes back to 60 before it goes to 100 I
[9649.319s] could care less I literally could care
[9650.96s] less all today was in the morning was an
[9653.76s] opportunity to increase my position and
[9655.96s] bring down my bases in a great business
[9658.52s] in a in a good business with great
[9660.68s] management and uh those are the things
[9662.92s] you can get doubles and triples in
[9665.0s] reasonable amounts of time over a
[9666.72s] handful of years so uh less than a
[9669.68s] handful of years uh also I have a
[9672.439s] co-investor named Dan L who is has an
[9676.84s] activist position in Advanced Auto s and
[9679.76s] he will continue to put the pressure on
[9681.359s] but the fact of the matter is without
[9682.96s] even going into an hour analyzing the
[9685.52s] earnings call which maybe we&#39;ll do next
[9687.319s] week um all I can tell you is he&#39;s doing
[9690.04s] everything he said he was going to do
[9691.64s] sell off westpack delever the balance
[9693.84s] sheet grow comp store sales retain his
[9696.72s] top people build the inventory so people
[9699.8s] so the uh local garages could get their
[9702.0s] parts faster than anywhere else make
[9705.12s] sure they didn&#39;t have idiots at the
[9706.439s] counter that didn&#39;t know anything about
[9707.96s] cars so he&#39;s made all those Investments
[9710.12s] and now you&#39;re going to see the turn
[9711.319s] just like PayPal everyone&#39;s like oh Alex
[9713.08s] Chris he&#39;s not going to do it well now
[9714.76s] he&#39;s doing it and then this then when it
[9716.439s] comes it comes all at once so we love
[9718.64s] these opportunities we love the
[9719.84s] opportunity when we could buy PayPal in
[9722.08s] the 50s and now it&#39;s in the 70s so you
[9724.439s] know we do that and by the way if you
[9726.72s] think you can outperform over time
[9728.96s] without stepping in in these
[9731.08s] aberrational periods of dislocation good
[9733.279s] lock these are Mana from Heaven this is
[9735.92s] where you make your money when everyone
[9737.76s] is running out the exit door yelling
[9739.52s] fire you run back into the theater and
[9741.88s] pick up all the purses because that&#39;s
[9743.76s] where the money is made and I feel
[9746.399s] deadly sorry maybe I won&#39;t in a week for
[9748.6s] the people who sold to me at $48 and $49
[9751.04s] this morning but I can tell you that in
[9754.52s] two years they&#39;ll be really sorry they
[9756.2s] sold to me I don&#39;t know in two weeks
[9757.8s] maybe they&#39;ll be like ah you were a bag
[9759.399s] holder for me for two weeks I could I
[9761.52s] could care less that&#39;s why we were R low
[9763.399s] leverage I know what I own and I use
[9765.68s] these opportunities Intel is going to be
[9767.56s] the same story by the way we brought our
[9769.24s] B is down to 23 and
[9771.76s] change
[9773.359s] this it&#39;s like the government won&#39;t let
[9776.88s] them fail they&#39;re going to have a doop
[9779.04s] we went through that story last week so
[9781.04s] anyway it&#39;s just Christmas time is all
[9783.2s] I&#39;m saying uh United CEO expresses
[9785.76s] renewed confidence in Boeing after
[9787.2s] meeting with new leader in orberg I
[9788.72s] covered that with
[9792.24s] Charles 14% of PC shipped globally in Q2
[9796.2s] 2024 were AI capable who owns that
[9799.279s] Market Intel owns that market they&#39;re
[9801.52s] going to ship 40 million aips as a
[9805.08s] matter of fact there&#39;s another article
[9806.72s] we&#39;re going to cover we we&#39;re um here we
[9809.68s] go Intel disappointed investors for
[9811.76s] corporate customers it&#39;s still good
[9813.399s] enough all the cios are like yeah yeah
[9816.439s] we like it we we know what it is it&#39;s
[9818.64s] worked for 40 years we&#39;re good with
[9820.439s] Intel it&#39;s fine um and by the way this
[9823.88s] is the key story Walmart louds AI that&#39;s
[9827.399s] good news for tech stocks okay it&#39;s good
[9830.76s] news for tech stocks the story the next
[9832.8s] story in AI is not Nvidia which is going
[9836.0s] to be effectively a commodity producer
[9838.52s] in two years when Intel starts competing
[9840.64s] with them and all these other companies
[9842.68s] start competing with them and the chips
[9844.76s] become an afterthought it&#39;s the
[9846.88s] application and Industrial companies
[9849.08s] start doubling and tripling because
[9850.76s] they&#39;re using AI technology off what
[9853.319s] will become commodity chips people think
[9855.56s] these Cycles it&#39;s like they keep
[9858.68s] happening and people keep getting faked
[9860.72s] out it&#39;s it&#39;s novel until it&#39;s not and
[9865.12s] um Intel in the land of the boring Intel
[9869.8s] is King uh so once this stuff becomes
[9872.76s] commodity Intel will have the Fabs Intel
[9875.439s] will be able to produce the most boring
[9877.0s] commodity stuff at scale and pick up
[9879.64s] share and rock and roll back by uh Uncle
[9882.84s] Sam himself with unlimited pocketbooks
[9885.359s] to make sure that that happens so uh the
[9889.6s] story is going to be how these
[9892.64s] applications and companies like Walmart
[9895.0s] and Industrial companies start to
[9896.6s] benefit materially Alibaba 10cent cast
[9899.88s] wide net for AI upstarts since 2023 40%
[9904.0s] of alibaba&#39;s deals in China and 30% of
[9907.04s] 10 cents have targeted AI
[9910.72s] startups so we&#39;ve talked about Alibaba
[9914.64s] is basically like owning a China AI ETF
[9918.56s] and what they&#39;re basically saying in
[9920.359s] this article is
[9922.92s] that some of these Investments are going
[9925.24s] to be worth so much money like we don&#39;t
[9928.479s] even know what we own like we know why
[9930.64s] we own Alibaba based on their core
[9932.399s] businesses and what is prices what we
[9934.6s] pay values what we get we know we&#39;ve got
[9936.2s] a huge bargain we don&#39;t even know what
[9937.96s] we own all these free options we have in
[9942.04s] all these AI startups in China that have
[9944.64s] to get their compute that Alibaba got
[9946.88s] huge Equity positions for giving them
[9949.279s] compute tokens which basically cost them
[9951.72s] nothing in their cloud service other
[9954.0s] than server racks um and three years out
[9958.399s] you know a couple of these little baby
[9959.92s] companies are going to be worth a
[9960.92s] hundred billion dollars and we&#39;re going
[9962.0s] to find out we own 15% of it and all of
[9965.24s] this stuff and that&#39;s just going to be
[9966.279s] whipped cream icing on the cake so you
[9969.12s] can read that article covered that
[9971.479s] covered that cover that uh let&#39;s see
[9975.04s] what else we got here
[9981.319s] this yes Disney&#39;s Deadpool in Wolverine
[9984.52s] becomes the highest grossing R-rated
[9986.0s] film of all time that franchise is
[9988.24s] valued at zero in the market it&#39;s going
[9989.88s] to be valued at a lot more in a couple
[9991.399s] of years uh dollar hit years low as
[9994.0s] Traders prepare for rate Cuts we you
[9996.0s] know you guys knew that was coming a
[9997.56s] year and a half ago if you&#39;ve been
[9998.72s] listening fed policy makers flag rate
[10000.88s] Cuts as job market cools so now they&#39;re
[10003.52s] Focus Shifting the focus um
[10009.8s] oh this is interesting City says hedge
[10012.16s] funds are using dollars as the new carry
[10013.92s] trades so just as the Yen was so weak
[10016.72s] we&#39;ve seen our positioning sentiment on
[10018.96s] US Dollars starting to turn much more
[10020.52s] bearish you think an environment where
[10022.84s] people are speculating about rate Cuts
[10024.2s] has fueled risk appetite so they&#39;re now
[10026.56s] rather than selling yen to fund other op
[10028.84s] uh Investments they&#39;re selling the US
[10031.04s] dollar to fund other Investments and um
[10042.16s] see the
[10049.04s] range
[10052.319s] ceny
[10055.8s] CL so that&#39;s that and then next is
[10060.16s] Jennifer Lawrence Gigi
[10061.78s] [Music]
[10063.279s] Hadid and
[10067.12s] uh I don&#39;t know who these I I know who
[10069.68s] Jennifer lawen oh and Emily Rakowski are
[10073.319s] now wearing Vans this is
[10075.6s] dated
[10077.6s] uh two weeks ago this is Mary
[10082.76s] Claire uh Emily ralsky Jennifer Lawrence
[10086.279s] and whoever this is
[10089.08s] um gii Hadid I
[10093.359s] guess so as Bracken referen in the
[10097.279s] earnings call which was actually very
[10098.8s] positive the numbers weren&#39;t great the
[10100.439s] the the earnings call was super great
[10102.399s] and we&#39;ll spend some time on that if you
[10104.12s] want to be here for 5 hours we could do
[10105.68s] it today but I think we&#39;ll do do it next
[10107.479s] week or the week after maybe with um uh
[10111.12s] Advanced Auto Parts but they&#39;ve got a
[10113.24s] machine going here so that was an
[10114.6s] article there US US US Weekly or
[10118.12s] whatever it&#39;s called had another article
[10120.319s] two weeks ago August
[10122.88s] 9th uh talking about Vans featured so
[10127.04s] they&#39;re they&#39;re turning the machine on
[10128.319s] now that they stabilize the ship our
[10130.279s] slip-on Vans the SAS of Summer 2024 that
[10133.68s] was a little while back small cars are
[10136.08s] selling faster than SUVs and trucks
[10138.24s] here&#39;s what&#39;s driving more buy buyers to
[10140.479s] settle for less there&#39;s interest there&#39;s
[10142.88s] volume hard to say if there&#39;s
[10144.8s] profitability we don&#39;t care if there&#39;s
[10146.399s] profitability all we need is volume for
[10148.279s] Cooper standard we do not care about
[10150.279s] Ford or GM&#39;s profitability we care that
[10152.479s] they race each other to the bottom and
[10154.24s] put out Millions upon Millions upon
[10156.279s] millions of cars with millions of
[10158.239s] billions on billions and billions of
[10159.88s] incentives and we&#39;re back to 2017 the
[10162.6s] difference is this time I think we can
[10164.08s] earn a lot more money on 17 million cars
[10168.12s] uh 18 million SAR than we did in 2017
[10171.16s] when the company was bloated and earned
[10172.72s] seven bucks and traded 146 so super
[10176.08s] exciting to see all the stuff that we
[10178.52s] had anticipated that took a little
[10180.12s] longer than always always takes a little
[10182.08s] longer so you can count on two things
[10184.08s] number one the thesis are always going
[10185.96s] to take a little longer than expected we
[10187.359s] have exceptions obviously
[10189.399s] uh that goes super fast uh and um and
[10193.96s] sometimes we catch the bottom tick but
[10195.2s] you can count on two things number one
[10196.84s] our first buy it&#39;s going to go lower
[10198.359s] before it goes higher we don&#39;t care our
[10200.68s] second thing that&#39;s going to happen it&#39;s
[10202.2s] going to just it&#39;s going to take longer
[10204.2s] than you expect but we&#39;re still going to
[10205.68s] meet our IR hurdles over a reasonable
[10207.72s] amount of time and that&#39;s what we do so
[10210.359s] McDonald&#39;s to invest 1.3 billion in the
[10212.76s] UK and Ireland over the next four years
[10215.0s] it does not sound like a a company
[10217.0s] that&#39;s slowing it sounds like a company
[10219.04s] country that&#39;s recovering key thesis
[10221.279s] there gxo smaller little play Asos which
[10224.56s] you know again we don&#39;t have a reason to
[10226.52s] make it a real position yet but we&#39;re
[10228.52s] waiting for that reason uh with baited
[10230.84s] breath bottom Fishers snap up Office
[10232.84s] Buildings at huge discount I cannot say
[10234.92s] this enough I have a lot of super rich
[10237.6s] people that are my clients that listen
[10239.64s] to this um with bees in front of their
[10242.72s] names with lots of M hundreds of
[10244.88s] millions of M in front of their names uh
[10247.52s] that know this this
[10250.359s] world there this is not what I do but
[10253.92s] I&#39;m telling you so much money is going
[10255.439s] to be made buying these bit these
[10257.92s] unbelievable properties at 80 and 90%
[10261.8s] discounts
[10263.8s] um so all I can say is I can see it it&#39;s
[10267.8s] not what I do for a living but I I&#39;m
[10269.72s] telling
[10270.84s] you fortunes are going to be made here
[10273.359s] fortunes so Arc Innovation fund earnings
[10276.52s] estimates as soon as unemployment takes
[10278.04s] up to 5% and everyone&#39;s scurrying back
[10280.239s] to work scared to keep their job and um
[10284.479s] and employers can start to demand look
[10286.76s] every employer knows that their work
[10288.68s] from home people are less productive
[10290.6s] that&#39;s statistically proven so they just
[10292.76s] have no power right now because they
[10294.6s] don&#39;t have an abundance of Labor Supply
[10296.68s] that&#39;s changing wait till that switch
[10300.2s] flips everyone&#39;s going to be forced back
[10302.319s] into the office and there&#39;s not going to
[10303.399s] be enough space and um I&#39;m I&#39;m talking
[10307.68s] billionaires are going to be created out
[10309.04s] of this hole this is this reminds me of
[10311.08s] the uh Orange County thing and uh linary
[10316.04s] and then in the in the
[10317.72s] 90s anyway uh all right Arc earnings why
[10322.08s] is that down well it&#39;s because their
[10324.08s] earnings estimates are down 21% for this
[10326.16s] year and 12% for next year REITs are up
[10331.0s] earnings expectations up 1% and 2% that
[10334.359s] is uh top 20 top 30 weights
[10340.72s] in the last 60 days what&#39;s happened to
[10342.239s] revisions for 2024 and 2025 utilities
[10346.2s] there earnings uh estimates have gone
[10348.84s] down by 410 of 1% for this year up 510
[10354.2s] or 610 of 1% for next year prices has
[10356.92s] gone up a lot I think they&#39;re due for a
[10358.359s] breather I think we&#39;re going to get a
[10359.479s] counter Trend bounce I think yields are
[10361.64s] going to go up a little bit oil and gas
[10364.56s] equipment
[10365.76s] Services uh earnings expectations down
[10368.56s] bigly 11% 8% that&#39;s why we haven&#39;t been
[10372.359s] uh shopping here our only energy
[10374.64s] exposure continues to be com stock which
[10377.12s] is up bigly in the last few months uh
[10381.279s] from 8 to 11 or I don&#39;t know where it is
[10384.64s] today RK eight to almost $11 so anyway
[10389.56s] that that&#39;s a rounding era it doesn&#39;t
[10391.2s] matter if it&#39;s eight or 11 I think it&#39;s
[10392.479s] going a lot higher
[10395.319s] um earnings estimates holding in there
[10403.479s] nicely uh you can see here initial
[10407.04s] jobless claims again these are these are
[10408.92s] Big Numbers fed is going to move this is
[10411.08s] big news and that supports all of our
[10413.76s] portfolio we&#39;re we&#39;re lined up for it
[10416.399s] all right so the podcast is over now
[10418.479s] we&#39;re going to do the ask me anything
[10420.08s] questions for those of you who want to
[10421.88s] stick around uh would love to have you
[10424.72s] and for the rest of you you&#39;ve had a
[10426.239s] long one but I hope you&#39;ve gotten a
[10428.439s] tremendous amount of value from Brandon
[10430.439s] and from everything else we do on a
[10431.88s] weekly basis Jim Jones Tom you always
[10434.6s] talk about your current Holdings could
[10435.8s] you talk about one that you&#39;re looking
[10437.16s] at and why I really enjoy your podcast
[10439.8s] um one we do every week talk about ones
[10442.04s] that we&#39;re considering and why or why
[10443.6s] not we have an acted some of that comes
[10445.439s] out of the ask me anything questions
[10446.84s] some of it comes out at lib but Our
[10450.08s] obligation is to our clients first they
[10452.6s] get the priority of our best ideas
[10454.479s] before anyone else uh sometimes
[10456.84s] simultaneously because it it doesn&#39;t
[10458.76s] matter in the scheme of things but
[10460.319s] because we&#39;re long-term holders we&#39;re
[10461.64s] not buying it for a day or a week or a
[10463.319s] month we could care less about
[10464.52s] short-term fluctuations but um our job
[10468.04s] is is I&#39;ll give you an example qxo okay
[10471.479s] that&#39;s a brad Jacobs company we&#39;ve built
[10474.0s] a decent sized starter position in it uh
[10478.88s] I think at around let&#39;s
[10487.12s] see yeah so
[10489.439s] qxo is Brad Jacob&#39;s new vehicle he wants
[10492.08s] to roll up Home Building supply
[10493.68s] companies uh so we built up a nice siiz
[10496.2s] position at
[10498.319s] $12.69 uh across all portfolios and um
[10503.399s] that&#39;s the good news it it dropped from
[10505.08s] like 90 it had a small float and blah
[10508.2s] they did a private offering at n or 10
[10511.52s] bucks
[10513.479s] um so there are two ways to look at this
[10516.239s] one so number one is is you could say
[10519.08s] well it&#39;s just a spack who the hell is
[10520.56s] Brad Jacobs and is trading at six you
[10523.239s] get $6 of cash for $12 of price that
[10528.08s] sounds like a stupid deal um except for
[10531.04s] the fact that it&#39;s Brad Jacobs and
[10534.0s] effectively his model works and every
[10536.96s] time he&#39;s done it he&#39;s made his owner&#39;s
[10539.319s] Fortune so you could say why would I
[10541.52s] ever pay $2 for $1 of cash he hasn&#39;t
[10543.84s] done a deal yet and the answer is
[10545.84s] because when he does a deal it&#39;s not
[10547.239s] going to trade at $12 it&#39;s probably
[10548.88s] going to trade up to $20 and then you&#39;ve
[10551.16s] missed the opportunity and then when it
[10552.76s] goes from 20 to 100 you&#39;ve only made 5x
[10556.04s] instead of 12 to 100 you&#39;ve made 8X so
[10559.68s] if you own it at 12 and he doesn&#39;t do a
[10562.08s] deal for a year and it drops back down
[10564.0s] to the cash price per share of $6 so I
[10566.16s] got
[10567.439s] 50% downside and 1,000% upside based on
[10572.6s] his you know if you look at his and
[10574.359s] maybe one time we&#39;ll we&#39;ll spend it but
[10576.279s] basically he wants to do 60 billion it&#39;s
[10578.439s] he always gets 15% of the revenue of the
[10580.84s] industry he goes into or F I think it&#39;s
[10584.0s] five or 15% I don&#39;t know it&#39;s it&#39;s he&#39;s
[10587.68s] done it in Waste Connections which was a
[10590.279s] waste management rollup made billions he
[10593.0s] did it for his shareholders in
[10595.279s] URI uh which was like a 47 bagger he did
[10598.439s] it in XO which was like a 37 bagger
[10601.88s] we&#39;re going to get probably a
[10602.96s] multibagger in gxo over the next few
[10605.479s] years that was spun out of xbo and I
[10608.399s] wanted to to be in qxo because I know
[10611.52s] rates are coming down and I know that
[10614.08s] the Millennials are going to be
[10615.319s] demanding huge amounts of new housing
[10618.279s] for the next 10 6 to 10 years and he&#39;s
[10621.68s] in The Sweet Spot and it&#39;s a fragmented
[10623.64s] business run by a lot of Boomers that
[10625.319s] are retiring that don&#39;t have kids that
[10626.84s] want to run the business so these
[10628.479s] smaller businesses are going to be
[10629.72s] rolled up and Brad Jacobs is going to do
[10632.319s] exactly what he does every single time
[10633.96s] take these Antiquated businesses add
[10635.8s] technology add efficiency run them
[10638.319s] better and scale them into a multibagger
[10641.6s] so um so while the value of the
[10646.52s] cash is only $6 a share I would
[10650.16s] attribute I would assign him five
[10652.68s] billion of free value because of there
[10655.68s] are only a handful of owner operators
[10658.76s] who have ever
[10660.359s] compounded Capital over decades at 20
[10663.359s] 30% for their
[10665.0s] owners um and to do it multi times none
[10668.52s] exist I mean there&#39;s there&#39;s not one
[10670.319s] that has had multi multi- hits other
[10672.8s] than Brad Jacobs that I know of um like
[10675.72s] three four five hits some have done two
[10677.76s] and three uh but compounding at that
[10680.2s] level so I&#39;m willing to to pay double
[10682.68s] the amount of
[10683.96s] cash uh in order to have a placeholder
[10687.2s] and a nice siiz position to participate
[10689.399s] in this and I think over the next decade
[10691.72s] it&#39;s going to be a beast an absolute
[10693.6s] Beast now so what happens if it goes to
[10697.12s] if if he Dithers and doesn&#39;t get a deal
[10698.8s] done for a year and it trades back down
[10700.56s] to the cash value of $6 then I get to
[10703.12s] buy more and bring my bases down to uh
[10706.04s] $9 you know and then then I&#39;ll have an
[10708.88s] you know uh 11 bagger when it goes to
[10711.64s] 100 over you know 6 to 10 years versus
[10715.6s] uh an eight bagger okay but I don&#39;t want
[10719.16s] it to run away from me and miss the
[10721.439s] beginning and then only have the chance
[10723.239s] for a five bagger because if it takes 10
[10725.52s] years it starts to run under my required
[10728.319s] r that I mentally uh focus on so I I&#39;ll
[10733.16s] leave that at that so
[10736.68s] um Matt says thank you as always for
[10739.16s] your generous giving of your time and
[10740.359s] expertise millions of people should be
[10742.0s] listening and taking advantage of your
[10744.12s] informative podcast a lot more of
[10745.76s] listening than you know because they not
[10747.239s] only listen through YouTube they listen
[10749.76s] through the podcast they um any anyway
[10753.72s] so there&#39;s a lot more people listening
[10755.239s] than we even know um
[10758.68s] thoughts on NASDAQ with impending IPO
[10761.279s] uptick room to
[10763.359s] run uh n AQ
[10794.479s] I
[10796.72s] mean it&#39;s price per Perfection it&#39;s
[10799.399s] performing like
[10801.2s] Perfection uh the gross margins
[10805.08s] though seem to be going down a little
[10809.6s] bit uh let&#39;s take a look at the balance
[10812.319s] sheet
[10830.0s] fortunately I&#39;m not on my regular
[10831.64s] computer today so all right
[10835.239s] um
[10836.96s] debt we&#39;ve got 10 billion of
[10839.56s] debt and it looks like
[10843.0s] about 400 million of cash I don&#39;t love
[10846.2s] that
[10859.479s] I don&#39;t know it&#39;s high single digit
[10861.56s] compounder that&#39;s good what&#39;s the free
[10863.399s] cash
[10874.96s] flow 1.5 billion
[10879.04s] what&#39;s it trading
[10886.319s] at eight times sales 10 times
[10893.76s] EV PR value eBid 20
[10899.56s] times 24 times it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s fairly or
[10903.56s] fully valued I don&#39;t I don&#39;t see any
[10906.96s] edge here I I mean this is like you&#39;ll
[10909.84s] be lucky if you get a double digit
[10911.84s] return every year uh I I&#39;m not
[10914.2s] interested in that one um I understand
[10916.88s] your thinking behind it but if you want
[10918.2s] to play uh IPO cycle wait for a
[10921.12s] correction in Banks and buy some of the
[10923.319s] best Michael
[10925.84s] digito was wondering if the Hong Kong
[10928.12s] game flow into Alibaba will be announced
[10930.04s] on a fixed date we covered
[10932.359s] that next
[10940.64s] Dom just a question uh question
[10945.12s] regarding Dom Durham uh free cash flow
[10948.92s] drop we covered that that was working
[10951.319s] capital issue because of the direct
[10952.96s] sales business and AI investment spend
[10955.72s] look at cash from operations was fine
[10958.16s] Jason
[10965.56s] Lee has the business deteriorated ated
[10968.56s] since you got interested no it&#39;s
[10970.6s] improved Kyle
[10972.8s] Burns
[10974.68s] um good your tire I don&#39;t like this one
[10978.04s] because they just have an uncanny
[10979.76s] ability to lose no matter how good
[10982.72s] conditions get uh the Koreans destroyed
[10985.8s] them and they&#39;ve got kind of a levered
[10987.84s] balance sheet I think this works for a
[10989.76s] trade I looked at this for a friend of
[10991.72s] mine uh client actually this week uh it
[10996.0s] probably works as a trade up to 20 bucks
[10997.8s] but this is just a lowquality
[10999.04s] commoditized
[11000.72s] business
[11003.16s] um Jason ha hey Jason uh excuse me not
[11007.96s] Jason Jackson H how are you Jackson good
[11010.279s] to good to uh hear from you my friend uh
[11014.8s] Jackson and I got out on the links
[11016.76s] together in Atlanta he&#39;s a super guy uh
[11019.439s] using official channels outside your
[11022.12s] Norm
[11023.64s] okay grudgingly sold Tesla at a nine
[11026.56s] bagger so looking for another long shot
[11028.6s] using the house money the rest pretty
[11031.319s] much in your
[11037.279s] faves uh well congratulations on your
[11040.56s] Tesla
[11041.6s] trade looking for another long shot I
[11044.439s] would just say Cooper standard I mean
[11048.239s] um I think it&#39;s run up a little bit I
[11051.2s] mean look Cooper standard on 20 is cheap
[11054.56s] if you know if it
[11062.439s] okay so all right it&#39;s over $15 now even
[11065.68s] $15 I kind of like it you know I think
[11068.08s] this is has a Hu I don&#39;t know maybe
[11069.72s] you&#39;ll get an look if Cooper standard
[11071.279s] goes back towards 10 back up the truck
[11074.359s] um I I think as far as multi-baggers go
[11077.56s] it it sounds like that what that&#39;s what
[11079.16s] you&#39;re looking for that&#39;s probably where
[11080.96s] I&#39;d be focused I&#39;d also have some com
[11082.96s] stock as well and um and so on all right
[11087.2s] let&#39;s see here but great to hear from
[11089.319s] you buddy we got to get on the phone oh
[11091.8s] I&#39;m sorry till oh he wasn&#39;t asking me

[11129.12s] see Jesus all right let&#39;s just see if
[11131.52s] they&#39;re going to live if the balance
[11133.72s] Sheet&#39;s okay and you want to take a punt
[11135.239s] on
[11136.08s] it I don&#39;t think the balance Sheet&#39;s
[11139.08s] okay let me just see
[11160.68s] I can I I can never recommend this I
[11162.84s] just want to make sure I I just want to
[11164.68s] see if you&#39;re definitely going to get
[11167.319s] hurt or only probably going to get hurt
[11169.84s] is what I want to really get you to
[11173.8s] here
[11175.6s] uh they just continue to burn
[11179.479s] cash oh every time that guy goes on TV I
[11183.359s] just feel like I never
[11185.52s] mind
[11188.399s] um all right the balance sheet let&#39;s
[11196.319s] see 280 million a debt which is not a
[11200.56s] lot two so the balance sheet looks okay
[11202.76s] they&#39;re burning cash so you need a
[11205.16s] catalyst before they run out of cash is
[11207.04s] all I can tell tell you I
[11209.359s] mean see if they&#39;re growing
[11214.84s] revenues yeah I don&#39;t
[11217.8s] know this is a tough one my friend this
[11220.52s] like this is just gambling Gamblers
[11222.439s] Anonymous here I would never buy this
[11224.399s] for clients I don&#39;t think I&#39;d ever buy
[11226.88s] it
[11229.76s] personally I don&#39;t know just just help
[11232.479s] me understand why they&#39;re going to live
[11234.8s] I guess SweetWater 420 Shock Top Shock
[11238.2s] Top isn&#39;t that
[11239.64s] dead
[11245.319s] um I wouldn&#39;t put my own money in it but
[11248.479s] you might catch it you might catch a
[11250.16s] wave they might get a favorable you know
[11252.0s] you got an election coming I don&#39;t know
[11254.439s] who&#39;s going to give them smart banking
[11256.12s] that&#39;s been the whole
[11258.56s] key um
[11270.96s] oh his view is if Cala and walls win
[11273.84s] schedule plus schedule one to schedule
[11276.239s] three what you got I if if if I
[11281.72s] mean Biden everyone thought Biden was
[11284.04s] going to help these guys out he didn&#39;t
[11285.399s] do anything so Biden is is
[11289.64s] uh I think uh Kamala is Biden part two
[11292.88s] so even if you&#39;re right you might not
[11294.12s] get what you want but it&#39;s a free option
[11296.6s] on it and it option has no expiration so
[11298.96s] long as they don&#39;t run out of
[11303.279s] cash it could work I just I can&#39;t
[11306.0s] recommend that to youbody I really can&#39;t
[11307.96s] and and and I&#39;m stuck because if it goes
[11309.96s] to 10 or 20 you&#39;re going to hate me and
[11312.359s] if it goes to zero you&#39;re going to hate
[11313.68s] me so there&#39;s no win there I just it&#39;s
[11317.04s] outside of my circle of confidence you
[11318.56s] know those Brands better than I do I I
[11320.6s] can&#39;t say anything about that Joseph
[11324.84s] n I&#39;m the golf guy that always comments
[11327.08s] onbe YouTube I know Joseph and I think
[11328.88s] you&#39;re also an author if I remember
[11330.319s] correctly uh thanks for your content and
[11332.479s] being so consistent go Baba anyway been
[11334.84s] wanting to ask a question forever seems
[11336.68s] to me every investor believes that
[11339.08s] Insider management buying is 100%
[11341.399s] indicator of The Insider management
[11343.52s] believing the stock will increase and so
[11345.72s] it would seem to me that there is a
[11347.239s] possibility that border of management
[11348.68s] would buy stock to send this signal to
[11350.12s] the market even if it didn&#39;t believe it
[11351.88s] I can imagine especially in a company
[11353.439s] with small market cap or wink wink from
[11355.0s] the board some CEO or components to be
[11357.6s] used for this purpose are you aware of
[11359.319s] any studies on this or examples it would
[11360.92s] seem that would be easy to figure out
[11363.04s] there is INS started buying just before
[11364.439s] bad news comes out I know academics who
[11366.76s] do these type of things
[11370.439s] um I wouldn&#39;t get I mean the one thing
[11374.399s] you want to consider with inside bu how
[11376.319s] material is it relative to their wealth
[11378.52s] that that&#39;s you know if it&#39;s token then
[11381.72s] it could be to send a message but the
[11383.96s] bottom line is
[11388.319s] the the studies show they&#39;re right more
[11389.84s] often than they&#39;re wrong but you got to
[11391.16s] do your analysis so like if I&#39;m at a
[11394.279s] point of buying and then I see insiders
[11395.92s] buying on top of it I get very excited
[11398.64s] um insiders selling means nothing
[11401.04s] because they they only buy for one
[11402.359s] reason they expect the stock to go up um
[11405.239s] they only sell for one reason and and
[11408.439s] they don&#39;t get enough bump like it&#39;s not
[11410.359s] like the stocks going to go up 10%
[11411.88s] because the CEO buys stock I mean unless
[11413.84s] it&#39;s some penny stock or Garbage promote
[11416.8s] um so I wouldn&#39;t be that cynical about
[11419.279s] it and I
[11420.6s] wouldn&#39;t consider it that indicative
[11422.88s] either because some of these guys I look
[11424.6s] at Insider buys every single day and
[11426.319s] some of them are buying stocks that are
[11427.6s] way up fully valued they in other words
[11429.399s] they drink their own Kool-Aid uh so I
[11431.96s] get more interested when people are
[11433.359s] buying a meaningful amount of stock
[11434.8s] relative to their net
[11436.399s] worth when the stock is washed out and
[11440.52s] the balance sheet is good so PS I&#39;m
[11443.8s] writing a book that will be entitled so
[11445.239s] you want to be a scratch golfer and when
[11447.08s] it&#39;s published I&#39;ll send you a copy
[11448.68s] audible if you like yes you know me very
[11450.64s] well it&#39;s directed at guys like you and
[11452.319s] me golfers who took up the game Earnest
[11454.0s] as adults awesome we&#39;ll be looking
[11456.12s] forward to that I&#39;m sure you&#39;ll get a
[11457.56s] bunch of clients from the uh from the
[11461.479s] podcast uh and then he&#39;s giving me some
[11463.72s] putting advice which uh is fantastic I&#39;m
[11466.439s] actually putting well since I got that
[11467.92s] lab golf putter that that brought my
[11469.8s] index down to 114 and then I&#39;ve just
[11474.16s] completely had three really bad rounds
[11477.6s] just not hitting the ball so I&#39;m going
[11479.04s] to get that fixed and uh I mean it never
[11482.12s] ends I was hitting the ball like a un
[11484.64s] like a pro when I couldn&#39;t Putt and now
[11487.12s] I can putt I can&#39;t hit the ball I mean
[11488.76s] it anyway but we keep coming back it&#39;s
[11491.2s] like an abusive relationship golf I mean
[11493.04s] it&#39;s unbelievable uh Bob Johnson hope
[11496.279s] the Olympics have inspired your kiddos
[11497.72s] to get even bigger the Women&#39;s Water
[11498.96s] Polo team could have used him help yeah
[11500.76s] no question uh can you take another look
[11504.68s] at Airbnb at this juncture
[11508.8s] feels like a better play compared to
[11510.16s] Nike and
[11511.72s] Lulu if I had to pick one consumer
[11513.96s] discretionary balance sheet is getting
[11516.0s] better and better quarter over
[11518.04s] quarter uh enough free cash flow to
[11520.04s] start buyback stock new business model
[11521.68s] from long-term rentals co-hosting with
[11523.319s] AI coner founder Le CEO seems very
[11527.6s] motivated yeah I looked at this a couple
[11530.2s] weeks ago I think and I just passed I I
[11533.04s] understand what you&#39;re
[11534.52s] saying um
[11555.92s] and revenues are going
[11561.56s] up that income yeah it&#39;s all recovering
[11565.319s] earnings per share
[11567.76s] seven so it&#39;s trading at like
[11570.8s] yeah good earnings
[11574.2s] growth
[11575.68s] [Music]
[11592.16s] multiples yeah I mean they do kind of
[11594.16s] have a mode in their space
[11597.6s] just wondering how much of this like
[11599.12s] people are starting to go around it like
[11600.96s] in other words once you rent once then
[11602.72s] you just go right to the owner like f
[11605.279s] and some of the other companies that
[11606.68s] blew up with uh outsourc free cash flow
[11610.239s] looks really good
[11630.8s] I think you&#39;re going to get another
[11631.8s] chance below 100 just be patient on it
[11634.279s] that&#39;s what I would say um and and go
[11637.88s] spend a lot of time on the conference
[11639.6s] calls I&#39;d listen to the last eight calls
[11642.279s] read the annual reports see what they
[11644.8s] said they were going to do and what they
[11646.2s] actually did what&#39;s the balance sheet
[11648.439s] look
[11651.64s] like 7
[11654.2s] billion 1 billion I mean you might have
[11657.96s] something here I think it&#39;s a little
[11659.479s] early so hang in there good find uh it&#39;s
[11662.68s] been on my radar I&#39;ve just not nowhere
[11665.56s] near ready to do anything with it Aaron
[11668.76s] Oda thoughts on Toyota no I don&#39;t want
[11671.56s] any o I don&#39;t want any original
[11673.479s] equipment manufacturers I want Cooper
[11677.399s] standard regardless of how cheap it is
[11680.12s] but Toyota is the only one who got it
[11681.8s] right that CEO said EVS are not going to
[11686.319s] have the demand you think and they said
[11689.88s] you&#39;re wrong you&#39;re wrong when everyone
[11691.64s] was ESG and blah blah blah and forcing
[11695.08s] it down people&#39;s throats and um and he
[11698.6s] actually had to step down and he turned
[11700.08s] out to be the one that was right and
[11701.319s] everyone else you know marry bar you
[11703.6s] know doing cartwheels in Washington
[11705.439s] blowing shareholders money uh and uh
[11708.04s] blew it up
[11709.52s] so

[11730.199s] regular CH take a look at
[11739.0s] Portillos oh my gosh engage capital I
[11742.84s] think he&#39;s a member at my club I was
[11744.8s] supposed to play with him last week and
[11746.439s] it rained
[11748.0s] um that&#39;s crazy okay so he&#39;s he&#39;s in
[11751.04s] that and he&#39;s in BFC which that&#39;s
[11754.08s] mindboggling that&#39;d be interesting if
[11755.8s] it&#39;s the same guy uh got to reschedule
[11758.56s] that that uh 18 but um
[11762.72s] anyway pushing for a turnaround at
[11764.68s] Portillos I was at Portillos for the
[11768.76s] uh Olympic development thing in Texas
[11773.68s] and I think we we covered it that week
[11776.239s] and I like it I just wouldn&#39;t put
[11778.279s] clients in it but maybe now I&#39;d be
[11782.08s] interested it didn&#39;t have enough
[11783.64s] operating track record but um this thing
[11787.6s] is a great
[11793.359s] business it&#39;s just the restaurant
[11795.239s] business is really hard
[11798.88s] um and right now they&#39;re going to get
[11801.0s] hit by the lower income consumer for a
[11802.88s] little
[11805.199s] while um
[11807.479s] cash
[11809.8s] flow I think I&#39;m like okay with this one
[11812.88s] but I wouldn&#39;t put clients in it as too
[11814.68s] risky but if you take a Long View I
[11817.04s] think they&#39;ve got a growth trajectory we
[11818.56s] covered it in more detail like I don&#39;t
[11820.64s] know four or five four or five months
[11822.64s] ago I think it was like December of last
[11825.319s] year maybe eight months ago it&#39;s just
[11828.199s] growing very
[11830.6s] slowly uh what&#39;s the cash flow like I
[11833.96s] think they were burning cash at the time
[11835.68s] too
[11837.479s] which bothered me a little bit yeah
[11839.6s] still negative free cash
[11841.56s] flow it&#39;s just not a great business it&#39;s
[11844.08s] a good business a good product it&#39;s just
[11846.12s] not a great business from a stock
[11847.72s] standpoint it&#39;s too slow for a business
[11850.12s] that that that small the growth rate is
[11851.96s] too low so that&#39;s why it&#39;s like a past
[11854.359s] it&#39;ll probably work you probably get a
[11856.12s] double on it
[11857.92s] but Len McAdams uh could you take a look
[11861.52s] at Cleveland Cliffs uh yeah that&#39;s in
[11864.64s] materials I&#39;ve looked at it I like that
[11866.88s] that guy we we actually talked about
[11868.479s] this two weeks ago so I&#39;m not going to
[11869.72s] do it again but thanks for tuning in Len
[11872.08s] Eric Haney and I said me it&#39;s a meth for
[11875.399s] me it&#39;ll probably be okay but not for
[11878.479s] me um I do want to get materials
[11885.399s] exposure Cliffs all right let me take
[11888.399s] another look at
[11893.279s] it going to be having dinner late
[11895.479s] tonight for my my awesome viewers want
[11899.0s] me to look at Cliffs let&#39;s see here all
[11902.239s] right free cash flows good revenues are
[11912.96s] okay I
[11922.52s] mean send it back in if it gets to 10 or
[11925.56s] 9 uh
[11936.0s] um W it&#39;s a lot of free cash
[11940.84s] FL what&#39;s the balance sheet look
[11947.16s] like 3.5
[11950.439s] billion on 1002 so that that&#39;s their
[11953.399s] problem is their balance sheet so you
[11955.439s] got to know when all of their debt
[11957.359s] matures what are the
[11959.96s] terms
[11961.6s] uh and on that basis then you know I
[11965.399s] don&#39;t think they&#39;re going to have
[11966.359s] solvency risk
[11970.96s] but you know the number one reason thing
[11974.04s] you need to figure out is why is it down
[11976.64s] what&#39;s the bearish thesis and why is
[11978.68s] that incorrect I mean it&#39;s
[11985.0s] obviously just I just don&#39;t like this
[11987.199s] type of business that much
[11994.359s] um yeah so I&#39;m agnostic on that one um
[11998.96s] Eric Haney big fan for over three years
[12001.04s] my man good for you thank you for all
[12002.8s] you do thoughts on
[12013.68s] atkr this looks like a broken stock
[12017.239s] what do they
[12028.56s] do cash flows rolling over their
[12031.0s] revenues are rolling
[12033.84s] over
[12037.68s] um electrical infrastructure
[12043.64s] products um
[12059.92s] yeah I just want to know what the
[12060.96s] turnaround plan is because that&#39;s a
[12062.439s] pretty precipitous drop in revenue and
[12065.12s] free cash
[12071.56s] flow free cash flows haved almost haved
[12074.76s] in the last couple of years and then
[12083.56s] uh
[12088.92s] M yeah I see what you&#39;re seeing I
[12096.64s] mean just help me understand why these
[12099.479s] revenues are going to re accelerate and
[12101.12s] I&#39;d be more interested but it&#39;s from 4
[12103.319s] billion down to 3.9 down to 3.2 that&#39;s a
[12107.399s] big
[12110.08s] drop um so what&#39;s the plan to stop the
[12112.92s] bleeding and start to turn it around and
[12114.92s] then from there you might have something
[12116.64s] I mean it&#39;s down a bit it was a grow goo
[12119.88s] growth company for a while 14 to 193 but
[12123.76s] you know yeah it&#39;s dropped 50% but these
[12126.199s] broken stocks man once they hurt the
[12128.6s] institutions could it bounce right back
[12130.64s] up like it did in
[12132.92s] 2022
[12134.72s] yeah um
[12138.52s] I don&#39;t know my I don&#39;t know my Spidey
[12140.279s] extense just says to avoid it for a
[12141.88s] little while wait for more pain and then
[12143.439s] revisit it and keep following the thesis
[12145.68s] remember this business you get paid for
[12147.399s] inaction versus action you&#39;re much
[12150.08s] better with errors of omission than
[12152.239s] errors of commission so be willing to
[12154.239s] let a few get away from you uh it&#39;s just
[12157.319s] the way it goes and that that&#39;s good
[12159.12s] because if you chase every shiny object
[12163.04s] um you&#39;re just going to spread too thin
[12164.96s] and you wind up hurt more often you know
[12166.84s] you want to go in when everything&#39;s
[12168.439s] pointing in your favor it&#39;s perfectly
[12170.239s] it&#39;s a fat pitch down the middle and you
[12172.359s] knock it out of the park so with that
[12173.96s] said we&#39;ll be back next week same time
[12176.239s] same place much shorter video cast until
[12180.199s] then make it a great one bye for now
