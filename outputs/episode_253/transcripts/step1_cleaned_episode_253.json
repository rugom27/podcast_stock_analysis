minutes\n### MEDIA_APPEARANCE_RECAP\nhere is  do the US overview because I know a lot of you want to get to that right now uh the first one we&#39;re going to cover is vne and Company I want to thank Stuart vanney Christian dagger and Preston Melle for having me on we discussed um PayPal and gxo and PayPal is important PayPal&#39;s been up went from 59 to 72 in the last couple of two three weeks uh you want to hear about that and here we go cuz we have a nice rally going on our hands here Dow up 300 NASDAQ up 250 it&#39;s come down a little bit from where we open the market but that&#39;s still solid rally Thomas Hayes joins me to inspect this market gain here um let me get this right I read your stuff you&#39;re suggesting we get a bit of a dip in the relatively near term and then at the end of the year a nice solid re year end rally is that it I think in the short term stew when the music is playing you got to get up and dance that&#39;s what we&#39;re going to do for the next few weeks however we&#39;ve got the first fed cut coming in September I think it&#39;s going to be a case of buy the rumor sell the news a little volatility after that first cut a little volatility into the uncertainty of the election once that&#39;s resolved we get a year- end rally no we get a year end rally we get a year profits are strong enough to justify that and rates are down far enough to justify that year-end rally that&#39;s right we&#39;ve got estimated 15.2% earnings growth for 2025 uh things are strong we just saw earning season up 10.8% versus 88.9% estimates margins are holding in there so and estimates are actually steadily climbing up so on balance Things Are strong little strength here enjoy the fun the next few weeks get a little defensive ahead of the election and then year end rally uh we&#39;re constructive uh looking out in the intermediate term do we get a year-end rally of carel Harris is the next president of the United States I don&#39;t want to get political with you but that&#39;s an important question it&#39;s no question I think the number one thing for the stock market look one candidate is pro business one candidate is pro government so t\n\nwe discussed um PayPal and gxo and PayPal is important PayPal&#39;s been up went from 59 to 72 in the last couple of two three weeks uh you want to hear about that and here we go cuz we have a nice rally going on our hands here Dow up 300 NASDAQ up 250 it&#39;s come down a little bit from where we open the market but that&#39;s still solid rally Thomas Hayes joins me to inspect this market

question I think the number one thing for the stock market look one candidate is pro business one candidate is pro government so t### FEATURED_COMPANY_DEEP_DIVES\nhere is  that dichotomy right there what the stock market needs to see historically is gridlock they want politicians to be able to do less so so long as one party doesn&#39;t get all three branches then we&#39;ll be certainly okay you got a couple of stock picks I want to start with gxo Logistics w\n\nhere is  that dichotomy right there what the stock market needs to see historically is gridlock they want politicians to be able to do less so so long as one party doesn&#39;t get all three branches then we&#39;ll be certainly okay you got a couple of stock picks I want to start with gxo Logistics where is  it now 48 bucks a share where&#39;s it going okay this stock fell 50% why they do Outsource supply chain and Logistics management the reason is because you saw the shift from Goods during covid to Services that&#39;s balancing out that trough in Q4 of 2023 we&#39;ve gone from the destocking cycle to the restocking cycle the operating leverage in this business is huge management is expecting iida to nearly double by 2027 so that implies the stock could not only double but you get multiple expansion once they get the double digigit earnings growth and double digigit Revenue growth back so we think this stock can go up to $100 over the next 24 to 36 months too no you really do like it the next one is Paypal okay everyone hates this yeah uh this is a great business why is it a great business cuz Alex Chris came from into it he ran half the business at into it the stock was a 38 bagger while he was there he&#39;s coming to PayPal he&#39;s increasing the margins he&#39;s got this uh branded checkout called uh that increases conversion to 50% at at the checkout to 80% what does that mean it means he can charge more so margins are going up they were supposed to do $5 billion of free cash flow this year he said no we&#39;re not going to do five billion we&#39;re going to do six billion oh and by the way we&#39;re not going to buy back $5 billion of stock we&#39;re going to buy back $6 billion of stock this thing is turning the corner $4 29 million accounts 10% of global Enterprise spend when you take an Uber stew I know you love to take Ubers that goes through PayPal through brain tree you don&#39;t see PayPal but PayPal&#39;s getting a piece that action $500 billion of of A5 trillion over the stock sorry you went through all this very complicated reasoning on those two stocks you never look down you haven&#39;t got any notes in front of you falling your head very impressive it&#39;s amazing when you have money at stake how serious you get about the stocks well said some well said Thomas thanks for joining us Thomas for soon all right and we&#39;re back and then on Friday I joined Charles Payne on Fox Business want to thank Charles Nick Palazo for having me on this was an exciting segment we discussed all kinds of seasonality and everything else the elections but we discussed Boeing and we discussed Cooper standard I want you to listen closely to this one this is another one that&#39;s on the move again excited about that [Music] all right so my next see notes that earnings margins and estimates that they&#39;ve held up but the Cavalry has to come no later than September joining me now great Hill Capital chairman Thomas Hayes all right Thomas who&#39;s coming to the rescue well I think it&#39;s time for the FED to come to the rescue uh we have a little bit of election year seasonality right now we&#39;ve got this August strength which is normal since 1955 August is strong the early part of in in in election years years since 1955 so you get a strong August you get strong first half of September but interestingly enough it rolls over late September early October which is coincident with the Cavalry coming doing the first cut and what we also know historically is the market tends to sell off after the first cut even though it&#39;s often up 12 months out Etc so I think uh a little bit of strength let&#39;s let&#39;s dance while they&#39;re playing the music right and then get a little conservative ahead of the election and and year and rally so that&#39;s interesting because I I I&#39;ve always kind of seen you as a Buy and Hold not necessar guy who says hey we&#39;ve got to be a little bit Nimble here yeah uh also though uh you&#39;re not big on a ma 7even you do point out that their earnings growth is decelerating while the rest of the S&amp;P is going up but I I I&#39;m going to put on the screen now this is just one of the it&#39;s decelerating but for next year Max 7 that 20% is still the best outside the Russell 2000 right so even though equal weight is going to go to 12% from 5% and overall S&amp;P 7 14% from 7% 20% is nothing to sneeze at is it no it&#39;s absolutely not and I think the theme\n\n### MEDIA_APPEARANCE_RECAP\nwe discussed Boeing and we discussed Cooper standard I want you to listen closely to this one this is another one that&#39;s on the move again excited about that all right so my next see notes that earnings margins and estimates that they&#39;ve held up but the Cavalry has to come no later than September joining me now great Hill Capital chairman Thomas Hayes all right Thomas who&#39;s coming to the rescue well I think it&#39;s time for the FED to come to the rescue uh we have a little bit of election year seasonality right now we&#39;ve got this August strength which is normal since 1955 August is strong the early part of in in in election years years since 1955 so you get a strong August you get strong first half of September but interestingly enough it

S&amp;P 7 14% from 7% 20% is nothing to sneeze at is it no it&#39;s absolutely not and I think the theme Here is  that they&#39;re going to have relative underperformance so under the surface the unmagnify you&#39;re going to see some stocks double you&#39;re going to see some stock triple there aren&#39;t many mag s stocks you&#39;re going to see double and triple over the next 12 18 24 months you&#39;re actually seeing it with all these activists buying up these cheap stocks that we&#39;re talking about you know like Nike you saw Amman like Ulta you saw birkshire like Starbucks you see Elliott so you see the activist starting to get into this cheap value and I think that&#39;s going to be the theme for the next 18 months I&#39;ve been pointing that out to my subscribers as well you could see it in some of these been some of these sessions we like whoa this is and these are names that are huge and just you know that you can sleep at night right and you know listen new management is amazing I love when a company brings on New Management um okay let&#39;s talk about money supply before we get to the stocks because money supply you saying is picking up so between money supply picking up and a friendly or fed isn&#39;t that a pretty good gust of win in the Sounds in the market no question about it so I think we get through this period here little bit of strength little weakness a little uncertainty ahead of the election but you cannot fight the increased money supply half a trillion dollars since the beginning of the year the FED will start to ease all the risk that we&#39;re seeing the cracks onto the surface defaults increasing auto loans delinquencies Etc they need the Cavalry needs to come to ameliorate that because if you get into a situation we saw little cracks in the labor market if they let that go we could start to face deflation and deflation is very hard to fix inflation they can manage I got one minute let&#39;s go over two stocks Boeing speaking of New Management now it wasn&#39;t Larry col which I&#39;m glad because I own G stock but this guy&#39;s got a got a pretty good resume yeah Kelly ortberg he uh Rockwell Collins he got there it was A7 billion market cap in 2012 he sold the business for 30 billion 6 years later this this guy knows how to create shareholder value in Industrials and the does he know how to keep a door on a plane well this is the beauty\n\n### FEATURED_COMPANY_DEEP_DIVES\nactivists buying up these cheap stocks that we're talking about you know like Nike you saw Amman like Ulta you saw

plane well this is the beauty finally  at Boeing we're going to have an engineer versus a Salesman running the company his first day he spent on the floor of the factory and the United CEO he met with yesterday he says I've got renewed confidence in Boeing now that I've met with the new CEO this is a great thing at the end of the day it's a duopoly it's good to be the king if you don't want to play it's not only a duopoly but if you look at the demand for aircraft commercial aircraft for the next 20 years this was a stock that I used to tell people never to sell and it's almost going to get back there less than 30 seconds um uh Cooper standard what is yeah we bought this in May of 2022 at $510 s they refinanced the debt went up to 22 now it's back down to 13 we haven't sold a share we bought more shares and I'll tell you why every single cycle in the last 45 years you've had 18 million SAR is the peak the sell through total vehicle sales in the United States we're at 15.8 right now if they just get to 16.1 forget about 18 which they'll do this cycle the the business is going to earn $3 a share you add a trough multiple of 10 times you got a $30 stock you add a peak multiple of 20 times you have a $60 stock and God forbid we actually get to $18 million SAR Peak this thing could fly so we're excited about this one all right good stuff man I like that you bring these ideas that no one else is talking about appreciate it all right folks K Harris and we're back and then\n\nat Boeing we&#39;re going to have an engineer versus a Salesman running the company his first day he spent on the floor of the factory and the United CEO he met with yesterday he says I&#39;ve got renewed confidence in Boeing now that I&#39;ve met with the new CEO this is a great thing at the end of

SAR Peak this thing could fly so we&#39;re excited about this one\n### MEDIA_APPEARANCE_RECAP\nI went over to Yahoo finance to talk with Julie Heyman uh about uh one stock to uh one stock that we like and one one stock sector that we would avoid want to thank Haley mark and Julie Hyman for having me on there it&#39;s a big noisy Universe of stocks out there welcome to goodbye or goodbye our goal to help cut through that noise to navigate the best moves for your portfolio today we&#39;re taking a look at cyclical and defensive stocks I&#39;m here with Thomas Hayes Great Hall Capital chairman and managing member thanks for being this home good to see you so the your buy stock is a cyclical stock right so we&#39;re talking about gxo Logistics this stock has not done great over the past year it&#39;s down a little more than 20% this is one of the spins of the former XPO Logistics which is Brad Jacobs creation and um you like that uh he is involved in this particular company as well yeah Brad Jacobs has the mightest touch if you got involved when he did United Rentals you made a 47 bagger if you got involved when he got involved in xbo logistics if you invested 1 million you got 30 1 million so he knows how to create value for shareholders so you ask well then why is the stock down so much that would be my next question yes so um this business does well they get paid for Outsource Goods okay so they do supply chain Outsource Logistics and there was a huge demand for goods during covid and then the demand shifted to services and their business the stock basically collapsed the business did okay and now that has troughed Okay so we&#39;ve gone from the destocking cycle which troughed in Q4 of 2023 and now we&#39;re starting the restocking cycle and they have huge Tailwinds behind them and basically operate in a duopoly with DHL so let&#39;s talk about the potential growth then you&#39;re looking iida basically doubling by 2027 this is guidance from the company they expect eida to nearly double by 2027 and what&#39;s interesting about that Julie is not just W well if eida doubles maybe the stock could double when you get that type of double digit growth rate back both on the top line and the bottom line you get multiple expansions so not only will the business do well but the multiple applied to the stock could actually expand in the meantime and that&#39;s why we see reasonably significant upside to this over the next two to three years that&#39;s we kind of jumped the third point a little bit in terms of that restocking cycle just starting but it&#39;s interesting when you talk about gxo and DHL I mean if what&#39;s also interesting about that is like I think everybody knows DHL as a household name gxo is sort of less known or recognized yeah he&#39;s not great with branding but he makes billions of dollars for his owners I got to be honest I mean he consistently does that you know they said something on the most recent conference call last holiday season was actually kind of a disappointment for gxo for the retailers Etc and what they&#39;re seeing right now in the month of August he&#39;s saying the clients are getting ready for a good holiday season it won&#39;t be shoot the lights out holiday season but it will be more in line with a normalized holiday season not a disappointment restocking is happening this is very positive Tailwind for gxo and uh they just completed the Winton acquisition in the UK so they they get close over 50% of their business from Europe UK is recovering Europe&#39;s recovering they just did a huge warehouse for Levis in Germany they&#39;re getting industrial business from uh different manufacturers like Boeing Etc uh all over the world so they&#39;re expanding verticals they&#39;re increasing the duration of contracts with their clients and it&#39;s a very sticky business once they outsourc their business to you you got them for life all right so what could go wrong well if it&#39;s a cyclical stock yeah and that you know restocking cycle doesn&#39;t materialize that would be bad news yeah that&#39;s a big thing I I think right now the only thing that could cause the recession is If the Fed Dithers uh they do need to go in September we saw starting to see some cracks in the labor market starting to see some cracks and defaults Rising even though they&#39;re historically low auto loan defaults Etc so if they move in September I think we&#39;ve got the head we&#39;ve got the Tailwinds from earnings we&#39;ve got the Tailwinds from GDP and this will be Off to the Races but if they get too cute with their Cuts uh that could be a problem gotcha okay now let&#39;s get to your goodbye stock and this one&#39;s a little contrarian here Tom we&#39;re talking about utilities the XL you know this group has been one of the winners of the year right and it&#39;s up almost 20% over the past year but you say let&#39;s hit the pause button and in part is that after the big runup that we have had yeah we were pounding the table last fall when you couldn&#39;t give away utilities everyone said no one needs energy anym I don&#39;t know what people were thinking but basically there was an expectation about rates that&#39;s different than the expectation right now so this has rallied on two basic things first of all as a group this is a defensive sector it&#39;s up 5050 % in less than a year so that tells me it&#39;s a little bit overdone here uh you know that that&#39;s a significant move and the the basis for this runup uh the AI narrative which is slowing down that that trade is cooling uh and cutting rates it&#39;s almost a buy the rumor maybe sell the news here right in other words people were buying an anticipation of the rate Cuts perhaps once they arrive the trade will lose some steam you think and\n\nall right so what could go wrong well if it&#39;s a cyclical stock yeah and that you know restocking cycle doesn&#39;t materialize that would be bad news yeah that&#39;s a big thing I I think right now the only thing that could cause the recession is If the Fed Dithers uh they do need to go in September we saw starting to see some cracks in the labor market starting to see some cracks and defaults Rising even though they&#39;re historically low auto loan defaults Etc so if they move in September I think we&#39;ve got the head we&#39;ve got the Tailwinds from earnings we&#39;ve got the Tailwinds from GDP and this will be Off to the Races but if they get too cute with their Cuts uh that could be a problem gotcha okay now let&#39;s get to your goodbye stock and this one&#39;s a little contrarian here Tom we&#39;re talking about utilities the XL you know this group has been one of the winners of the year right and it&#39;s up almost 20% over the past year but you say let&#39;s hit the pause button and in part is that after the big runup that we have had yeah we were pounding the table last fall when you couldn&#39;t give away

this has rallied on two basic things first of all as a group this is a defensive sector it&#39;s up 5050 % in less than a year so that tells me it&#39;s a little bit overdone here uh you know that that&#39;s a significant move and the the basis for this runup uh the AI narrative which is slowing down that that trade is cooling uh and cutting rates it&#39;s almost a buy the rumor maybe sell the news here right in other words people were buying an anticipation of the rate Cuts perhaps once they arrive the trade will lose some steam you think and finally  it&#39;s a defensive stock and if you look at earnings if you look at GDP Etc I don&#39;t think you want to be overly defensive right now you&#39;ve seen Staples have run up a lot utilities have run up a lot um and you see it in fund managers and this is usually contrarian indicator they&#39;re 1.4 standard deviations overweight utilities above the long term average so it&#39;s what we like to call a crowded trade in other words it it is getting a little bit crowded and uh and I think it&#39;s a little bit overdone at the moment interesting okay so what could go right for utilities the exact it&#39;s the opposite of the other ones it&#39;s opposite day if we if the fed dids and we go into a recession you want to be in defensives and this would do well although given the multiple expansion that they&#39;ve had already it&#39;s like I don&#39;t see where the additional upside comes from well or or I guess if you have the continuation of the AI trade and you know is are the fortunes of Nvidia The Fortunes of the utilities for example as we continue to see a build out of AI infrastructure and the demand for power yeah it&#39;s part of it yes uh but I think a better derivative way to play that is through natural gas and I think those stocks are beaten down so these have priced in the possibility of great things happen the natural gas stocks are are trading like they&#39;re dead all right save that for another goodbye or goodbye I guess thank you so much for coming in appreciate it we we&#39;ll leave wanting more won&#39;t we on this Friday appreciate it all right thank you so much for watching

totally fortuitous um you know I I you know from the New York area and after college worked for a a big us uh mutual fund family ended up moving to San Francisco in a firm called Barkley&#39;s Global Investors which was the largest institutional passive an index quantitative manager globally was starting a thing called ey shares and I just had the kind of dumb luck of being a part of a small team probably two dozen people that uh you know they brought in all these very senior kind of captains of industry and and little old me um it&#39;s very clear it was a startup with a kind of a rich uncle that we were in a different building than the rest of the company so if it didn&#39;t work they were just gonna kind of unplug us but it turned out to be an incredible success um and I had this great learning experience of being a younger person being a sponge and just wanting to learn you know you had you know the former head of marketing from a very large US fund family you had the head of trading head of portfolio management the head of sales heads of marketing you know I&#39;m in this little room with all these incredible people um so you know learn the ETF industry through and through uh ultimately our parent Barkley&#39;s Bank ran into some problems in the financial crisis uh sold uh I shares and bgi to to Black Rock and um you know I&#39;m from New York so uh I&#39;d come back and just walked up the street you know with my box to uh to Black Rock worked for them for a few years great great company uh incredibly successful company and uh but wanted to do something more entrepreneural so happened to meet John Crane who American who had lived in China built a successful business geared to China&#39;s growing Urban middle class but wanted to take what he did in the retail retail space apply it to finance and he was looking for someone to help build the company and I was like hey if you want to build an ETF firm I I I can help do that wow uh so you know really back uh quit my job in the beginning of 2013 and you know there&#39;s really just a handful of us zero clients zero assets zero brand uh started started the company from nothing really based on John&#39;s vision and gumption and um you know so my job was to help make that vision investable and that big part of that was launching uh you know kweb our China internet ETF uh uh but also really trying to provide a balanced perspective on China&#39;s economy and capital markets so U that that&#39;s a big part of what we aim to do and obviously we&#39;ve done more things besides China climate and a few other things uh um but really my my day-to-day focus is is on the China China investment business so your timing was impeccable for a number of reasons one you basically got in on the beginning of the ETF wave at granted we had the qes and we had the spiders but really you were ahead of the crowd and you picked a niche which uh which had an incredible run and you know one of the things that I was looking over the hangsang as I was uh getting ready for this call and it&#39;s it&#39;s almost symmetric pretty much every two to four years China has these you know abysmal crashes followed by parabolic rallies and and here we are uh effectively two years into an abysmal crash uh in China and uh you can&#39;t convince anyone that there&#39;s any green shoot or any light at the end of the tunnel This Time It&#39;s Different uh you&#39;ve been doing this for a number of years over over a decade now in China uh how is this different or how is it actually the same I I I don&#39;t think it&#39;s different you know we we like to your brains are kind of wired I&#39;m I&#39;m into behavioral finance and uh our brains are wired to find easy solutions to complex problems like the stock market um and I think I think if you if you step back big picture um you know from 19 I ran these numbers just now I um you know if you go back and look at you know there&#39;s a time period from you know basically the end of 1999 through the end of 2009 you know us equities had a negative negative return wow non non us equities vastly outperformed particularly Emerging Markets particularly China um over that 10year time period and um that I think you know one this abysmal Market the US uh where people gave up on us equities during the financial crisis because that was the second 50% draw down that was the foundation for this bull market and so you know in in the 2000s you had non us equities particularly em and China um and then and then it kind of flipped right when people were least prepared for it we&#39;ve gone backwards where now the S&amp;P 500 from the GFC low is up over a th% non us equities aren&#39;t even up a third so all country world xus is not even up 300% it&#39;s up 280 em is not even up 250 China&#39;s not even up uh 150 um and so people say hey like you know this is American exceptionalism but but you you forgot about the decade before and what if the next decade it flip-flops again I and and the one factor I&#39;ve been following Tom um is the is the dollar yeah that the US dollar was uh you know went from being in those 2000s deae gating so non you know non non dooll denominated assets pre you know to flip-flopping we&#39;ve had this incredible bull market just using uh the dxy um you know as a proxy the US dollar actually from its its bottom in April of 2011 actually went up uh just about 56% the the Dollar&#39;s actually come off it&#39;s U its highs in 2022 but but if you think about a 50% return over you know you know call it you know basically uh 11 years you know this is yeah this is like a three a 3% Tailwind US Stock STS get every year versus non US dollar denominated so so so there&#39;s actually some signs that the dollar is weakening and you know you know we don&#39;t have to go into you know us deficits 34 trillion and uh uh you know maybe you know the election and all that but but you&#39;d say there&#39;s not a lot of fiscal responsibility in in Washington DC and yeah you there&#39;s an argument that dollar is starting to reflect that and if you believe not you know the FED cuts and to what extent you know that would be you know uh a negative for the dollar so so anyway I&#39;m just saying that you can kind of see some of this regime change potentially taking place just in terms of US versus non- us and certainly China you know China has had some real issues I&#39;m not not saying China&#39;s it&#39;s all rainbow and unicorns over there it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s not um at the same time the Western media narrative I don&#39;t think is necessarily um fair and balance let&#39;s put it that way yeah I agree you know it&#39;s funny in the podcast one of the periods we continue to reference as an analog is the 2001 to 2007 period and you had a lot of similar conditions that you know Tech got overvalued as a percentage of the S&amp;P uh the earnings Etc the dollar actually was super strong in 99 2000 then it rolled over as it rolled over you saw emerging markets in China have it&#39;s its most historic Rally from 2003 to 2007 uh commodity started to move with the weak dollar uh the the whole story and if you look back it&#39;s interesting you said about flipflop flopping decades back and forth because in the 80s emerging markets and international did extremely well and then 90s you had this uh outperformance and if you look at kind of the US narrative uh of late decelerating earnings growth for the mag 7 accelerating earnings grow grow for the unmagnify the good news is you can make a tremendous amount of money in the 493 that have lagged where you can find Value and you&#39;re seeing activists go into you know Starbucks and maybe not Lulu yet but I&#39;m sure there you know Disney all these value stocks that are not going anywhere um but with the weakening dollar whether it&#39;s due to deficits whether it&#39;s due to uh fed policy uh Etc historically you you you have to look very hard to find an environment where the dollar weakens and emerging markets in China don&#39;t do well um having been through Cycles you know you had these big draw Downs obviously 2009 2011 right before you guys got started uh 20156 2019 Etc you you know over and over and then obviously the the the only one that replicated what we&#39;re seeing right now in terms of Max magnitude besides 2009 was that 2001 to 2003 can can you give maybe your probably most recent recollection is that uh 20156 kind of what was going on there what was sentiment what was unemployment like uh uh policy prescriptives and how they similar or different to maybe what we&#39;re seeing right now and how you think about lights at the end of the tunnel or it&#39;s it&#39;s just too hard to discern and you just got to hang in there with low valuations until something clicks yeah that that was an interesting time period because you had a uh you China&#39;s economy was doing well I mean some of the western media that there was ghost cities and Shadow banking uh but but in China know and believe that if if anything um the preceding time period was an incredible bull Market particularly in uh mainland China so so one one important thing is that we always differentiate between mainland China the Chinese Asia so Shanghai Shen Zen stocks predominantly only owned by investors in China and compare that with Hong Kong and us adrs which are predominantly owned by Foreign investors um and the mainland went through a huge bull market really driven by uh margin driven debth MH and that Bubble Burst and and when the bubble burst in the mainland Market uh that market you know June July August of 2015 I&#39;ve never seen any I mean that market went down for three months almost consecutively and and it it took out kind of the even though the the offshore Market had none of this debt driven U it kind of the perception and then you had the Chinese devaluation of the currency which again you know you&#39;d say I mean and this is what&#39;s kind of interesting is you&#39;d say well what&#39;s you know China devalued its currency by you know it was like 1% or two percent but just as we saw a few weeks ago with the Yen de okay if you&#39;re a normal investor you know you&#39;re not using leverage you if you&#39;re lever 10 to one 100 to one a thousand to one yeah even what we just saw with the Yen de you know this that Yen carry trade unwind uh just shows you know the people that are really levered up I mean they&#39;re getting carried out feet first and even though China didn&#39;t devalue the currency which is you know was kind of a currency adjustment I would argue more than a outright Deval um it&#39;s took out highly levered players and uh the knock on effect rippled through through the global markets and it was you know like like the Yen yeah it was shortlived so so it wasn&#39;t that was not really an economic Malay was just it was actually the almost the opposite of what we&#39;re seeing today you know today you couldn&#39;t give the shares of China away on the street you know no one be like you know you know please you know take it away yeah and and some of this I would argue it&#39;s just if you think about if you think about you know 15 years you that 15 years is we&#39;re talking about 60 quarterly you know times you open up your you know brokerage statement um or your investment committee meets or your board meets or your trust I mean it&#39;s really hard and this isn&#39;t in China or but but really non us equities is is it&#39;s really really I mean you get on you know as a professional investor you g under a lot of pressure hey why do you own this stuff that always is a drag and you start whittling it down and all of a sudden it&#39;s gone and and I think I think you know you know my little joke is you know unfortunately Harry Martz passed away uh not too long ago but but verification has died for many investors I mean there&#39;s one game in town it&#39;s us equities and then I would argue you know yeah there&#39;s a few pockets asml in the Netherlands or TSD in Taiwan or Samsung in South Korea but you almost got to cherry pick these individual names or these little markets but it&#39;s there&#39;s one game in town in US equities and you know that bredth is even narrow you know to kind of the mag seven and it&#39;s a GL Global phen it&#39;s not just us investors it&#39;s a global phenomenon in my opinion yeah yeah until it changes and and you know one could say that the US exceptional was certainly Justified because the earnings power supported it okay uh but now with the capex investment margins are coming down and they have to do it because if they&#39;re not that&#39;s their game the digital game so uh with margins decelerating and and the dollar weakening the other thing that you said about uh Chinese Deval on their currency the other thing that we focused on on the podcast historically is that we need to see bond yields go up in China and we need to see the currency start to appreciate in China and just as they on on a dime could devalue their currency do you think we could see strength in there now they might be holding back on the basis of well if if Trump&#39;s come trump it doesn&#39;t matter Trump or Cala they&#39;ve both been tough on China yeah uh comes in and wants to do huge tariffs you know we&#39;re going to devalue to just offset the the tariffs so you you can do all you want we&#39;ll just cut our prices by using our currency um so so tariffs are not going to be terribly effective against China as a matter of fact I read something that if they did a 60% tariff on China it would affect Chinese GDP by two percentage points so effectively go from 5% to 3% which is still faster than the US so it doesn&#39;t really serve anyone because we don&#39;t have uh any any willing workers to go into uh uh you know the to to go into factories and and deliver the type of stuff that we need yeah yeah Diplomat we&#39;re definitely skeptical of the uh you know let&#39;s bring back pollution and and let&#39;s destroy the environment and you know if you want to bring it back then volunteer to have a rare earth process and Factory in your in your town and there&#39;s just there&#39;s just no way I mean you know we rich people Outsource our pollution to these poor people if it&#39;s Emerging Markets if it&#39;s if it&#39;s China or India or Bangladesh and yeah I mean we&#39;re very skeptical you know we think some of the Tariff rhetoric is this is the art of the deal and if you think 60% tariffs are you should short Walmart and Costco and home Apple yeah I mean and and yeah I mean you know just unfortunately you know the you know some of the data gets lost in some of the political hyperbole but but you know we don&#39;t we think it&#39;s you know re you resurrecting Smoot and Holly is is not a very good idea for any political leader and so we&#39;re very skeptical of some of the the Tariff rhetoric and by the way as it relates to Japan I I think yes it&#39;s over and I think it&#39;s it&#39;s more couched than over because effectively the J Japanese trade it&#39;s not based on true underlying fundamentals or demographics if anything it&#39;s just the opposite what it was is we have to have Asia exposure we&#39;re not willing to have China where do we go we go to India and we go to Japan now the fact of the matter is is they&#39;ve got inflation now and they have to hike they hiked the FED didn&#39;t hike on that same day you had a liquidity mismatch and you saw what happens how levered it is and the Mitch Match the only reason it&#39;s quote unquote over is because the boj came out and said our bad we&#39;re going back but they still have to move in that direction they just have to wait for the Fed so the FED 100% has to go in September because J Japan was the global liquidity provider for the West for two plus years while we were fighting inflation buying bonds buying equities printing money now they need our help we didn&#39;t come to their rescue in August we dropped the ball uh Howell maybe underestimated the impact of the leverage uh but now in September I think the FED goes Cuts I think you&#39;re going to see boj shortly thereafter hike because they don&#39;t want to you know let inflation out a spiral out of control that&#39;s going to slowly let the air out of the carry trade that money&#39;s got to go somewhere in Asia India&#39;s overvalued uh China is going to go back to in in our view um yeah yeah I I agree 100 perc I mean I think a lot of the money in Japan and and India came out of out of China I think a lot a lot of money you know from Asia&#39;s gone into mag s yeah and and I think as the FED Cuts you know that that dollar weakness it&#39;s really going to weigh on these Asian investors particularly you know in the EM world you know those those em central banks are raising rates you know you know around China we see uh See you know them wanting to ease but but you know they&#39;ve not wanted to depre you know every time the currency deap reci they get labeled a currency manipulator so they&#39;re very hesitant to to allow that but they&#39;ll the pboc will wait wait for the FED to cut and likely follow suit they&#39;ve been uh they&#39;ve they&#39;ve you they&#39;ve cut different intra Bank lending rates and the loan prime rate and bank reserve rate but they&#39;ve really not cut broad interest because they&#39;re worried about the currency effect and and and a lot of things you mentioned you know China&#39;s the Chinese government&#39;s been very worried about strong fiscal stimulus because of the creating more debt in China and we&#39;re starting to see a little bit of a change in tune there um it&#39;s it&#39;s slow you know they&#39;ve not wanted to do you know free checks in the mail modern monetary Theory as we did here because of the effect on debt and inflation so so they&#39;re being much more prudent or conservative on fiscal stimulus but but you know we would say there&#39;s signs it&#39;s coming and you&#39;re seeing it in the e and the home appliance space But even just very recently uh the Premier Premier Lee spoke about uh supporting domestic consumption more so so I think they&#39;re realizing that okay if the US is cutting rates it&#39;s because the US economy now whether or not it&#39;s headed to recession is slowing and that that&#39;s going to be a problem for export driven manufacturers like Japan like China and so to they&#39;re going to have to raise domestic consumption to offset the coming weakness in exports and and I think that&#39;s why you&#39;re seeing this slow slow pivot me there are other facets to of why China&#39;s economy has been rather tepid if it&#39;s the housing crisis and the effect on the consumer the scar tissue of zero covid but but they&#39;re actually you we seeing these little talk of consumer vouchers start so and and I think think I think that&#39;s where Alibaba you which really um was really well you know John Crane showed me this picture of jackm 2012 and was like you know The Whole World&#39;s Gonna know who this guy is I was like who is it you know and uh he&#39;s like this company&#39;s going to go public and it&#39;s going to change the world of investing and and to his credit he was you know John&#39;s Vision came to fruition but but Alibaba is really uh the transmission engine for domestic consumption in China and there&#39;s other players you know pindu Duo Tick Tock um you know bite dance in China JD but but but Alibaba is um you know um very well-run company and uh you know they&#39;re uh having had a dinner with them I guess it&#39;s been about two months in h two months ago in Hong Kong and uh that you know I came away you know very confident in um the you know management leadership and uh you know their vision for you know things improving you know they&#39;ve obviously been adversely affected by the tepid economic growth particularly around domestic consumption but but I think there&#39;s t\n\n Premier Lee spoke about uh supporting domestic consumption more so so I think they're realizing that okay if the US is cutting rates it's because the US economy now whether or not it's headed to recession is slowing and that that's going to be a problem for export driven manufacturers like Japan like China and so to they're going to have to raise domestic consumption to offset the coming weakness in exports and and I think that's why you're seeing this slow slow pivot me there are other facets to of why China's economy has been rather tepid if it's the housing crisis and the effect on the consumer the scar tissue of zero covid but but they're actually you we seeing these little talk of consumer vouchers start so and and I think think I think that's where Alibaba you which really um was really well you know John Crane showed me this picture of jackm 2012 and was like you know The Whole World's Gonna know who this guy is I was like who is it you know and uh he's like this company's going to go public and it's going to change the world of investing and and to his credit he was you know John's Vision came to fruition but but Alibaba is really uh the transmission engine for domestic consumption in China and there's other players you know pindu Duo Tick Tock um you know bite dance in China JD but but but Alibaba is um you know um very well-run company and uh you know they're uh having had a dinner with them I guess it's been about two months in h two months ago in Hong Kong and uh that you know I came away you know very confident in um the you know management leadership and uh you know their vision for you know things improving you know they've obviously been adversely affected by the tepid economic growth particularly around domestic consumption but but I think there's there is  a light at the end of the tunnel and um there's a lot there's a lot that they're doing to try to change that as well from a management perspective yeah yeah it seems like they you know at first they had the breakup because they wanted to say look the sum of our parts is greater than the whole but it was a bad environment for the IPL the other thing I wanted to quickly ask on the on the policy you know it's been this slow drip for 12 months every week they are doing some level of Mini stimulus mini support do you get a sense that they're building or they're just not enough like they just need they they need a Hard Punch or or it's going to get momentum because it's compounding all these little things that they've been doing these mini Cuts there manyi stimulative things over the last 12 months any sense that uh we're going to see a atic effect from that yeah I mean the you know president G and the top 200 leaders in China got together at this thing about a month ago called the third plenum and uh the third plenum doesn't dictate policy but it but it sets the direction and the main takeaway from the release that came out of it was it was a clear acknowledgment that the economy is not doing great I mean that that I think the market was like oh there was no policy at but that's not what that's not what they that's not what they do you know China's a bureaucracy and the message gets filtered down to these different agencies that then push push it down and the you know the biggest worry is always policy error and and and you know from the government and and and the the exhale I had was like okay yeah these guys didn't they didn't put lipstick on it they they they knowledge t\n\nthe economy or every government cares about the economy yeah because you know political regime change takes place during financial crisis I mean I mentioned you Smoot Senator Smoot and Senator Holly just like President Hoover did not get reelected in 1932 right you know no different than Boris Johnson or you could actually say you know president Trump you know because of Co the US econ so so and China is no different you know China is not immune to this and so the acknowledgment and and you&#39;re starting to see the super tanker doesn&#39;t doesn&#39;t you know pivot on a dime but so I just say you&#39;re seeing a a change in the tone and tenor from what&#39;s coming out of the government and they&#39;re actually being more vocal and I I think the key Tom is you know there&#39;s there&#39;s a barometer which is that Chinese ashare market now the Shanghai Shen xan that market is not doing great and that that is a vote of no confidence from the Chinese people on what the government&#39;s done so far now now that doesn&#39;t affect us because you know you know the the internet names the grow stocks they tend to list outside of China predominant because they were funded by us private Equity yeah no different than bite dances owned by Americans I mean I just you know this Chinese company it&#39;s owned by Americans stop stop saying that just stop saying but but you know most of the companies we hold in kweb you know Alibaba was funded by Silver Lake right and seoa and you know mo and so those companies the the venture capitalist and private Equity investor they wanted a US dollar exit yeah and that&#39;s why they listed here in the United States or you know even 10 cent is actually listed in in Hong Kong and that was to maximize value right go to the biggest Market possible yeah so uh let&#39;s shift gears one of the things we always say we don&#39;t like to take C country and Company risk at the same time it&#39;s part of the reason we&#39;ve expressed um our um our position through Alibaba and I want to talk about the earnings here first and foremost we have uh something coming up in August 22nd where we&#39;re going to have the vote to have the Dual primary listing uh and then if that&#39;s approved which it appears that it will then September 9th we go live uh in Hong Kong supposedly so it&#39;s estimated if you look at 10 cent if you look at uh Alibaba if you look at mwan mwan when it when it did the Dual primary listing in 2019 it was up 17% in the first month some of the others not as much because they were in Weak markets uh it&#39;s expected that up to 10 to 15% of the market cap could come from China buyers over time so you&#39;re looking at 20 to30 billion dollars of buying power coming in over the next 9 to 12 months uh can you speak to that and the implications you think that might have yeah yeah I think this is um you this is this is a big Catalyst for the company that&#39;s southbound uh stock connect is a program there&#39;s Northbound which allows foreign investors like like you know at at crane shares we do invest not in KW but in other strategies in the Chinese a share market and allows a foreign investor to go through the Hong Kong Stock Exchange and by Shanghai shenzen stocks and the reverse is true with southbound stock connect which allows institutional and uh High net worth investors in China to invest in Hong Kong stocks but it&#39;s not all Hong Kong stocks that have to be Hong Kong eligible and one of the requirement there&#39;s there&#39;s been various requirements um and you some of those rules have changed over time relaxed um but if you&#39;re primary listed outside of Hong Kong you you&#39;re not connect eligible okay and so Alibaba the shareholders will vote you know to make its dual primary which would make it um southbound connect eligible and I&#39;ve actually been I&#39;ve I&#39;ve made some phone calls um you know you know between us to Alibaba to the Hong Kong stock what is the exact date and and and I think people being very Koy on what is the exact date so I you know the the September 9th you know you know we&#39;ve talked about and and you know I&#39;ve seen some people kind of backtracking you know some people saying hey maybe that you know maybe it could be sooner you know maybe it&#39;ll be a little later so so but but but the key is it&#39;s coming and just to your point time you know you know how do we know what&#39;s coming well you know we did some comparisons you know you know 10 cent which um has about about a billion user just over a billion users of we chat uh it&#39;s you know China&#39;s Facebook and you know Alibaba the two main Ecommerce uh Tau and Teo have about 900 million users uh so you could say well what are the number of users or we could look at the number of shares or the percentage of market cap so about 10% % of 10 cents call it 400 billion in market cap is held so so you&#39;d say okay about 40 billion could go into Alibaba um but you could say well alibaba&#39;s you know only about 200 billion so 10% you know so so you know we don&#39;t we don&#39;t know exactly how much will come in it won&#39;t come in day one but you&#39;re talking about 20 to 40 billion yeah uh coming in I mean I mean this is a real number I mean this is a real real Catalyst and um you know you know I kind of D say like you know imagine not being own able to own Amazon yeah uh you know you use it every day and know you know you&#39;re you know I you know it&#39;s like you&#39;re gonna go Coco for Cocoa Puffs like you&#39;re GNA say I can buy the you know\n### FEATURED_COMPANY_DEEP_DIVES\ncountry and Company risk at the same time it&#39;s part of the reason we&#39;ve expressed um our um our position through Alibaba and I

alibaba&#39;s you know only about 200 billion so 10% you know so so you know we don&#39;t we don&#39;t know exactly how much will come in it won&#39;t come in day one but you&#39;re talking about 20 to 40 billion yeah uh coming in I mean I mean this is a real number I mean this is a real real Catalyst and um you know you know I kind of D say like you know imagine not being own able to own Amazon yeah uh you know you use it every day and know you know you&#39;re you know I you know it&#39;s like you&#39;re gonna go Coco for Cocoa Puffs like you&#39;re GNA say I can buy the you know\n\n but if you&#39;re primary listed outside of Hong Kong you you&#39;re not connect eligible okay and so Alibaba the shareholders will vote you know to make its dual primary which would make it um southbound connect eligible and I&#39;ve actually been I&#39;ve I&#39;ve made some phone calls um you know you know between us to Alibaba to the Hong Kong stock what is the exact date and and and I think people being very Koy on what is the exact date so I you know the the September 9th you know you know we&#39;ve talked about and and you know I&#39;ve seen some people kind of backtracking you know some people saying hey maybe that you know maybe it could be sooner you know maybe it&#39;ll be a little later so so but but but the key is it&#39;s coming and just to your point time you know you know how do we know what&#39;s coming well you know we did some comparisons you know you know 10 cent which um has about about a billion user just over a billion users of we chat uh it&#39;s you know China&#39;s Facebook and you know Alibaba the two main Ecommerce uh Tau and Teo have about 900 million users uh so you could say well what are the number of users or we could look at the number of shares or the percentage of market cap so about 10% % of 10 cents call it 400 billion in market cap is held so so you&#39;d say okay about 40 billion could go into Alibaba um but you could say well alibaba&#39;s you know only about 200 billion so 10% you know so so you know we don&#39;t we don&#39;t know exactly how much will come in it won&#39;t come in day one but you&#39;re talking about 20 to 40 billion yeah uh coming in I mean I mean this is a real number I mean this is a real real Catalyst and um you know you know I kind of D say like you know imagine not being own able to own Amazon yeah uh you know you use it every day and know you know you&#39;re you know I you know it&#39;s like you&#39;re gonna go Coco for Cocoa Puffs like you&#39;re GNA say I can buy the you know\n\n### MISCELLANEOUS\nfinally\n\n### FEATURED_COMPANY_DEEP_DIVES\nright you know this company went public back in 2014 so so anyway so um yeah we think we see it major Catalyst um and and there&#39;s there&#39;s there&#39;s other things that I think are going in Alibaba from you know some of the macro um you know there&#39;s been some fundamental reasons why alibaba&#39;s struggled just uh domestic consumption increased competition but you know to me to me you know ultimately Alibaba buying back stock you know they&#39;re opening up a brand new headquarters you know yet those are not things that company that are facing severe hardship do right you know you hoard cash you know you don&#39;t you don&#39;t build a new campus uh but you know if you are a company owned by the founders you know if you have those same entrepreneurs who started it whose net worth is in the same stock as as us those are the things you do you buy back stock hand over fist and you build a new headquarters you&#39;re like okay things are going to get better not worse in the future yeah in my yeah no question about it the the second thing is um when they are on the uh dual listing in Hong Kong will they be able to buy back stock through the southbound connect without issuing preferreds or are they still going to have to issue preferreds to get cash uh out to do the buyback because because uh that could be another major Catalyst that&#39;s limited their although they&#39;ve been buying back and issuing preferreds at very favorable rates it&#39;s limited their ability to do what they&#39;re able to do uh or potentially want to do without doing preferreds to get outside you know cash outside the borders to buy back stock that&#39;s been my assumption as well that uh you know you know alibaba&#39;s revenues are predominantly in rmbi which is why they did these uh the convert deal um that that you know they don&#39;t have a lot of US dollar or Hong Kong dollar Revenue so I think you know the connect eligibility allows that to go through southbound uh my assumption and I can come back and confirm that um but my assumption is it would go through southbound wow and therefore you know it you they&#39;ve done I mean alibaba&#39;s done such a shareholder friendly move of capping the you know the convertibility to remove the delution I mean this just shows this is a you know the company is being very shareholder friendly they did the first dividend in SE in December of last year they&#39;re doing a164 in dividends for shareholders this year you know this this is a company that&#39;s you know you done a lot of shareholder friendly it&#39;s just if everyone owns mag 7 no one really cares about you know um and then and and I would argue you know other peers in the space you know the buyback yields of companies in the space it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s you know it&#39;s just out of sight out of mind you know um you know there&#39;s there&#39;s other peers in the space have gone down a similar route I mean I&#39;m um probably showing some of my own bias of being uh more of a buyer of baskets than individual plays but but Alibaba I think uh yeah very very I mean that was part of my dinner in Hong Kong with uh you know some folks from you know senior in the company who&#39;ve been there a long time is just uh you know they&#39;re very they have a very high vested interest in seeing the stock go up on a personal basis and um they&#39;re doing something about it that was that was kind of the the takeaways we&#39;re doing something about it and if you know you know there was more of this disappointment that more you know other invest besides you know crane chairs and yourself Tom are not picking up on this um but I think I think I think you know again you know these these regime changes from a market leadership don&#39;t happen overnight it&#39;s and you know takes a little time and i&#39; I&#39;d argue it&#39;s there&#39;s some signs of that and I&#39;m not rooting for us equities to go down don&#39;t get me wrong you know personally I&#39;m heavily invested yeah um professionally I have no exposure um picking up where we left off one of the things I was talking about earlier was we don&#39;t like to take company and Country risk and when we wanted to get exposure to a weakening dollar and Emerging Markets we saw Alibaba as the play to do that number one because it&#39;s a national champion I don&#39;t think that&#39;s changed much uh and number two in poker and I played uh Texas Holden with some friends I&#39;ve had the same group for about 15 years now in poker you like a thing called called outs and what I saw in Alibaba was outs in the sense that the cloud business is kind of in its nent stages if you look at Legacy Cloud business digitization of China is probably about five years behind the digitization of the us and we saw Amazon&#39;s big AWS run from 2016 to 2021 and now we&#39;re shifting into the AI and gpus uh W which they&#39;re catching up on and then obviously you know retailing is a tough business as Charlie Munger always says uh we had some some market share loss but that&#39;s showing signs of stabilization so um so I would say two things um for those folks that um and then the third thing we wanted is we wanted the ability to have some outperformance so we wanted to be a little concentrated if we got the company right and we got the country right and we got the the thing but for those that that are are comfortable with just getting brought exposure because when it works uh and speaking to what you said before you know these things don&#39;t happen overnight but what what we see if we look back at the last one two 3 four five six I&#39;m looking at seven huge draw Downs since 1994 uh even though they all took a with the exception of 19898 which that that was just an acute situation but most of them took two years to build a base but once they turned the turn was very abrupt and and and abrupt in a way that it almost didn&#39;t let anyone in once it started going um so yeah they don&#39;t happen overnight but one meaning they they&#39;ve got to build a couple year base but when they turn it&#39;s like night and day so um maybe speak to that number one number two um if if people don&#39;t want to take company risk and you referenced uh Alibaba being kind of the toll taker for consumption in China uh I know Alibaba is one of your top positions in your fund uh a how can they get your ETF and and B how would that give them broad diversification to to when we do get that uh abrupt move in in the right direction and then opinion starts to follow Trend and and they all go up in concert effectively yeah yeah I mean it&#39;ll be um you know again I think I think one of the interesting things you know um my background kind of on the index methodology side is at the end of this month is msci&#39;s quarterly rebalance and because India&#39;s outperformed China by so much within the EM Benchmark that India will be about 20% of the EM index and China will be about 24% China was closing in on 50% of the index uh preco so so one you&#39;d said this you this incredible Fall From Grace but but mathematically if you think about India at 20% China at 24 well India&#39;s GDP is three and a half trillion and China&#39;s 18 trillion does that make sense to you so so the indices themselves have a little bit of this momentum effect and you know I think I think the you know when you have very you know sector concentration um sometimes that&#39;s ringing the bell and you you saw that in the US a few years ago where you know the energy stocks were yeah you know basically kicked out of all the indices and you know then you know energy had so so I think I think there&#39;s an opportunity for China at this point and I think this index rebalance maybe you know is the ringing the bell at the top on on on the India trade and maybe you know may maybe ringing the bottom for China because you have some of these positive in terms of Economic Policy uh but also just the incredible valuation of these companies including Ali me one time you know stat that that we didn&#39;t and I always love to share that I think you you and your your shareholders would love is that Al Alibaba has very little debt but they do have a few US dollar bonds and and they have a bond that comes due in 2031 and and obviously interest rates have been rising here in the US the last few years so that Bond&#39;s lost about six% uh in US investment grade corporates have lost 7% over the last three years but would you believe that bond is down 6% and alibaba&#39;s stock is down 66 yeah this up by the way it&#39;s almost like in the US when a company gets kicked out of the Dow they tend to outperform over the next 12 to 24 months um it&#39;s funny that you brought up the energy trade because that&#39;s kind of what put my podcast on the map during covid um and uh and we had a huge run because we were buying xon the highest quality in the most dislocated circumstance when when oil turned negative and it was like I think the waiting got down to 2.5% from a peak of 10% and was the exact same thing pensions can&#39;t buy it anymore ESG you can&#39;t own it blah blah blah until the price went up and then opinion followed Trend and now these pensions can&#39;t get enough energy stocks so um it it history really does Rhyme it it it it often repeats and that&#39;s why I continue to emphasize that scenario in 2001 to 2007 because the abrupt move that we&#39;ve had in tech stocks in China uh was very much like that period and then you had the the strengthen dollar go to the weaking dollar I do want to shift gear by the way so Alibaba in in terms of the China Tech index that that&#39;s one of your top couple Holdings what percentage weight is that in the kweb it&#39;s almost 10% wow so that&#39;s that&#39;s a huge position how many Holdings do you have overall we&#39;ve got 32 um you know we do cap of the largest holding at 10% okay that you know you know exchange traded funds are 40 act mutual fund so the Investment Company act 194 so so there are diversification rules we have to abide by y um and and we rebalance semiannually so as stocks go up and down you know you can have movement there but uh yeah I mean we we were very early you know we bought shortly after the IPO that&#39;s kind of what helped put us on the map was uh we were the kind of the first ETF to own Alibaba because we had this kind of FastTrack inclusion um and then actually we were one of the only ETFs at the time that actually owned us China adrs that you know most China ETFs only held Hong Kong stocks so there all these little intricacies to indexing and uh that&#39;s kind of again that&#39;s kind of my background and something I&#39;m into it&#39;s like a cry for help but you sleep well at night but um yeah on you know popping the hood on this stuff really does matter and a lot of the arguments against China is like oh well the it hasn&#39;t you know the hangsang hasn&#39;t done anything in 10 years or Ms but but you know 10 years ago China was the index was 50% two sectors financials and energy wow you know like like you had you know you had no exposure to uh the tech sector I mean the tech Sector 10 years ago in msci China was under 3% of the index yeah but that 3% actually outperforms the S&P 500 over the same time period even even though the Benchmark in the aggregate so so that&#39;s where we kind of say like you we wanted to kind of pull out I call it like the good stuff yeah these grow companies you know the value energy financials Industrials materials real estate those are slower low growth sectors and yeah you you know that was kind of the point of John cr&#39;s Vision in creating crane shares is hey like give give people the ability to segment out these more growth companies but you got to go in and get them because you particularly you know when we started you know uh you know 11 years ago there was you know there was you know no no exposure in the broad Benchmark so um that&#39;s kind of the you know one of the key points about crane then and then providing people with the data you know that every day I wake up and I turn on the you know Financial TV or you know read the local finance and you know you&#39;d think the world was ending in China and you know again you know when you go there it&#39;s it&#39;s very different and um you know streets are crowded the traffic&#39;s terrible restaurants are crowded you know yes there are issues without question but you know I think if if a chinese doctor cured cancer yeah the US headline would be China Fires at doctors right just it just there&#39;s just this constant uh negative narrative and you know maybe that&#39;s where you know the US government needs to justify its existence with a Boogeyman and the problem is US investors are highly exposed to China yeah um and even you know that&#39;s through US multinationals like you know the Teslas and apples and boeings and caterpillars and Starbucks that are doing great in China and you know this idea that we have this huge trade deficit with China is is not true if you take the profits if you take the profits of us multinationals for the stuff they manufacture in China and sell to the Chinese it&#39;s about 500 billion which is the amount of the trade you know the trade deficit is what&#39;s put on a boat but if you include the goods manufactured in China by us multin t\n\n###

into alibaba&#39;s most recent earnings because what is going to be the driver because really honestly the F like if if China all the sudden wanted to get massive Equity inflows probably the number thing number one thing that they could do is buy Alibaba shares and drive the price up 50% because then all the indices would go up and then opinion follows Trend and all the pensions would be like you&#39;re under performing because you have no China exposure and it would just be like the oil thing in 2000 I&#39;m not saying they&#39;re going to do that like the Japan these did but they are in the market buying some equities leaving that aside let let&#39;s talk realistically about the the pluses and minuses because to some degree the health of China equities is dependent on Alibaba because that&#39;s what westerners know yes you have 10 cent speaking about outs we had the cloud we had the retail even fres shippo that thing could become the Costco of China I mean it&#39;s not there yet it&#39;s a couple billion dollar business but um um so so we talked about the the new buyers coming in they also announced something called they&#39;re going to copy 10 cent and Pino duo in doing the six uh 610 of 1% service software uh software service fee on all transactions I did a back of the napkin uh a math on that revenues last year for tbow and t-all were 57 billion so 60 bips on that is 342 million to the bottom line alone that starts in September which about 14 cents a share give or take it&#39;s not huge but but it increases the profitability increases the free cash flow now if they can buyb stocks through the southbound connect and not have to issue converts to buyback stocks that that could that could be a factor but you know revenues were anemic look GDP 5% they only did 4% revenues that&#39;s that&#39;s not great uh but Cloud business revenues\n\nhere is to go into alibaba&#39;s most recent earnings because what is going to be the driver because really honestly the F

that that could that could be a factor but you know revenues were anemic look GDP 5% they only did 4% revenues that&#39;s that&#39;s not great uh but Cloud business revenues finally\n\naccelerated to 6% uh year-over-year and AI product Revenue grew at triple digits year-over-year so maybe speak a little bit about um my thinking about tab TL has always been like okay TL&#39;s got teemu&#39;s gotten some share because they&#39;re selling like the lowest end lowest margin stuff at a loss so they&#39;re getting share in a weak economy but when the economy normalizes and you want higher quality Goods uh no one can compete with tound t-all so it&#39;s kind of like a d double bite at the Apple as the economy improves the stock does better but as as the economy the business also starts to do materially better because timu is not really competing with them as aggressively in those areas that they&#39;re entrenched for over a decade um uh maybe speak to your thoughts on uh on alibaba&#39;s uh tbow t-all business and then maybe their Cloud business and future prospects yeah I think the e-commerce which you know in uh was you know 15 of the 36 billion in in you know the latest quarter Revenue you that&#39;s geared to China&#39;s domestic consumption story you know about 26% of all retail sales happens online um and and I think you know what&#39;s what we&#39;ve seen what&#39;s weighed on that business is you have this I call it scar tissue from zero Co that what happened in China was different than here and so out of that consumers have been very conservative um and then you also have a decline in real estate prices in China and and that&#39;s that&#39;s upwards of twoth thirds of urban household wealth in China is invested in housing and so as they&#39;ve lost they&#39;ve seen prices for the first time in their life have actually Fallen the the consumer you know they&#39;re being a little bit more cons more conservative I thought there was a interesting quote from alibaba&#39;s you know uh rival uh 10 cent that their Chief strategy uh officer uh had an interesting quote where there he said we&#39;ve seen the government actually rolling out very proactive policies to encourage consumption um that at some point the consumer siment as well as the economy will start turning um and that it&#39;s not that people don&#39;t have money people actually have have money but they chose rather not to spend it and government policies can induce more confidence among the consumer and start revitalizing parts of the economy so so anyway so I think I think you know I mean I like that quote you know from senior man you know senior person at 10 cent but but you know it speaks to what what&#39;s coming for Alibaba and so Alibaba you know in when the when the domestic consumtion piie was just growing growing growing when you&#39;ve got new newer competitors like pind duo duo or jd.com which historically has been willing to really drop their margins to Discount y you&#39;ve got uh bite dance Tik Tock in China so so part of the issue for for alib is when the pi stopped growing yeah started materially losing some market share so so my hope you know our you know our belief is that as the pie starts growing again it helps insulate Alibaba besides the moves they&#39;re making to to head off some of these competitive threats at the same time I do agree Tom that part of what gets us excited about this is the growth in Cloud um the non-china Ecommerce business you know which grew 32% um and then you&#39;ve got their Logistics business is doing great grew 16% so that&#39;s where you know the aggregate revenue for the company grew 6% even though that that Commerce is becoming they&#39;re becoming less dependent on over time um has had some challenges so so so you know we kind of Envision that the other parts of the business start taking up more of the slack and and certainly Alibaba is benefiting from you know kind of policies that the Chinese government has implemented in Southeast Asia in Africa in the Middle East in terms of building relationships this kind of belt and road yeah you China is a benef you know you know Alibaba is a beneficiary of that I mean there&#39;s you know so that you know as these governments do more you know the the President of Vietnam is in China today like you know do you think alibaba&#39;s benefits from that you bet you know not not through subsidies or anything it&#39;s just more of you know as these countries do trade deals you know it opens up the way for Al you know Alibaba doing incredible business in Turkey getting into Europe anyway so so yeah it&#39;s it&#39;s actually you know it&#39;s almost the irony of some of the Tariff talk where man don&#39;t you see how inflationary that is for the US consumers and here&#39;s where you can point to um you know trying to exports deflation and you know anyway so there&#39;s others elements of the business that has have us excited they just historically been really overshadowed by this core eccommerce but but we are more constructive going forward yeah all BuyBacks and dividends yeah yeah and and I think as it&#39;s interesting it&#39;s like the chip bans were the worst thing that we could do from a national security standpoint because what we have ultimately forced the Chinese to do is create competency themselves and all that means is you take some of the best people from our companies you offer them four times the pay and you basically get all the intellectual property transfer whereas when we were just willing to sell them and make them dependent on our drug which was semiconductors they weren&#39;t as urgently innovating and figuring out a way to do do it themselves and I think in some sense the weakness in the China&#39;s economy has forced companies like Alibaba to agressively grow internationally so all these things are going to hit all the cylinders are going to hit all at once they didn&#39;t have the cylinders of trendal and turkey and they and lzada and all these other and and theyve grown really fast in the Middle East and in Europe that that probably would be less of a possibility if China was you know growing the way it was so so as it returns it&#39;s going to be like everything all at once yeah I mean I think it&#39;s every you know every investor in apple should recognize the checkers and not chess strategy of policy toward um Huawei where you know this you know and and their telecommunication business you know have no idea if they were spying or they clearly engaged in corporate Espionage in the past I mean without question uh um but you know they also you know to when the Govern US government decided Huawei should pay for those sins in the past by cutting them off the the company had two choices either you go bankrupt or you innovate and that&#39;s that&#39;s created the number one competitive threat to Apple where they chose to innovate and they created this thing called the Huawei prom mate 60 plus which is arguably a better phone than an iPhone wow and um it it&#39;s not some cheap knockoff it costs it&#39;s expensive uh but it&#39;s arguably a better phone I mean just flat out it&#39;s a better phone and um that has become a real problem for Apple in terms of iPhone sales in China uh but additionally similar to what you&#39;re see to your points on Alibaba with lzada and um you know Huawei you know they&#39;re not going to be allowed to sell them here but you bet they&#39;re selling them in Latin America yeah um in the Middle East across Asia because it&#39;s just it&#39;s a great phone yeah yeah so it goes to show you don&#39;t mess with the free markets uh a couple other things I wanted to highlight here Cloud Cloud&#39;s adjusted EBA increased 155% uh and he said quote we&#39;re observing strong and sustained demand for AI products and solutions from our customers uh continues to strengthen Market leadership so Cloud had been a drag because they were unwinding the Tik Tock business which was the largest customer and then they were cutting out um Shifting the the business public and private trying to get out the unprofitable business can you speak at all about uh either laying fears or talking about public and private cloud and how Alibaba can maintain its its hegemony in the space I think they&#39;ve got 38 to 41% share at the moment yeah I think in general some of the Diplomatic falling out where you can argue the US and China kind of went through a covid divorce you know they Co babies and and there&#39;s some signs of uh that&#39;s improving Panda&#39;s diplomacy and uh uh just this week U uh pboc met with US Treasury officials and but anyway but but there was t\n\nHuawei prom mate 60 plus which is arguably a better phone than an iPhone wow and um it it&#39;s not some cheap knockoff it costs it&#39;s expensive uh but it&#39;s arguably a better phone I mean just flat

laying fears or talking about public and private cloud and how Alibaba can maintain its its hegemony in the space I think they&#39;ve got 38 to 41% share at the moment yeah I think in general some of the Diplomatic falling out where you can argue the US and China kind of went through a covid divorce you know they Co babies and and there&#39;s some signs of uh that&#39;s improving Panda&#39;s diplomacy and uh uh just this week U uh pboc met with US Treasury officials and but anyway but but there was t\n\na consequence and unfortunately for us Cloud they're going to lose those China customers if it's AWS or Microsoft Oracle um and and that will stay inhouse now now in general there's been there there there's been encouragement from the government for state owned Enterprises and other other private companies in China to Leverage The technological capabilities of companies like Alibaba tensent and Badu who invested in you know kind of all the buzzwords AI Cloud big data that that they have a technological knowhow and and then if because of some of this diplomatic Fallout you're not going to be comfortable giving that to a US company you know no and vice versa then it's going to stay it's going to stay in China so so now the issue that Al you know what's interesting is people say oh well that's a pre- you you're pre-ordained Alibaba no no no like these companies in China compete with one another like nothing else and so I think you have this race to Garner market share that's weighed on some of the margins in Cloud um and and but that that will sort itself out right it'll find a balance if anything you're seeing some signs in in the electrical vehicle space or another where you there's no barriers to entry you've got giomi which makes cell phones creating an EV like how the you know but you know so so that competitiveness in China um I think you're seeing the government say wait whoa whoa you know you know solar capacity EV capacity and I think that will happen in in cloud and in and actually in technology where you'll say Hey listen you can't you can't let these py victories take place so so I think I think you know the market will find is still finding its way on terms of pricing But ultimately Alibaba is really really well positioned uh and will be one of the winners there yeah no question and uh you know another thing that people are going to have some worry about is the uh free cash flow okay so they generated 4.6 billion cash from operations 2.3 billion of free cash flow that that's down uh materially but they' they've identified two key reasons for that uh and maybe you want to speak to a little bit about that first was uh increase investments into Alibaba Cloud infrastructure so what they're saying is our demand is so strong that uh quote as soon as we get a server up a server is instantly running at full capacity that's the kind of demand so we can expect to see a very high Roi on over these uh next few quarters because we're building compute power to meet existing demand and that new compute power coming online is getting instantly taken up and running at full capacity on day one so they could either not invest and have five billion dollars of free cash flow or invest and and uh in in kind of the the Gold Rush days of AI cloud and gain share and keep their their hegemony which is what they've chosen to do but the other thing that impacted free cash flow because we emphasize that on on a our podcast a lot when we're doing turnarounds we do a lot of turnaround situations Baba is one it and the CFO said quote your second question is about free cash flow as I explained there's quite a big significant drop of free cash flow one of the reasons is the significant increase in expenditure AI Investments uh the other reason is because of sort of the working capital changes in relation to some of the business scale jobs what they did which also hurt the tbow t-all was they're reducing that um direct sales business I don't know if you're familiar with but that was down material they're proactively doing that because I guess it was low margin and he goes if you look at the business scale jobs many of them the majority are from those plan scale down as if you like as I was explaining why our direct sales business within tawau and t-ball dropped quite significantly the reason is we proactively scaled some of these onep business in T tbal and t-all we believe in some of these business categories onep format probably not a more efficient format so that sort of practice but if you uh but you will also have some of the business scale job was not proactively did that some of that overall Market situation the revenue dropped for example from SAA like in time all those businesses are one p and the job of their SC actually impacts working capital uh I don't know I can probably give you a bit more color on because one p on the other hand you're buying inventory from a vendor on the other hand you sell it and does the vendor normally give you a credit term like 60 days or 90 days if you can make your money your inventory turn over I.E sell inventory within a short period of time shorter than the short-term credit you're given actually you are generating cash flow particularly if the size is going up you're generating positive cash flow so on the contrary if you're reducing scale in this case on purpose uh it will have outflow on the working capital but is that a permanent impact he's he's asking a rhetorical question and he says to me I think that is relatively temporary impact so this process of reducing sale in that direct sales business uh we see this type of outfly outflow but when the business becomes stable we will no no longer see these types of outflows so for everyone worried about free cash flow and is the business deteriorating it's not it's one it's proactive decision on on uh investment and number two taking down this business this undesirable business the direct sales business for them is impacting working capital which is what is is impacting free cash flow and you can see that partially evidenced in cash from operations still being $4.6 billion and then buying back $5.8 billion uh of stock um so I I think that's kind of the the key highlights good to see the AI revenues up 200% uh it's good to get that explanation and then Eddie woo the CEO uh proclaimed that they're going to return to double digit Revenue growth in the second half of the fiscal year with gradual acceleration thereafter that's huge because no one is predicting that China GDP is going to go up to 8% or 9% so he's saying we're going to go from underperforming GDP in tbal and t-all to dramatically outperforming uh GDP as as the the monster player um and then the final thing I'd say two things that I liked about getting the cash under control first thing was this was a real pet PE mine so they bought $5.8 billion a stock but it was a net reduction of 2.3% of the share count uh because they've been doing a lot of employe stock options uh uh Employee Stock plan and which you said when meeting with these people people they were really motivated to get the stock price up because they all have a ton of stock what I'm glad about is that starting last last quarter they started to replace a portion of alibaba's uh ESOP incentives with long-term cash incentives for our employees starting last quarter these cash incentives will be reflected as cost and this is huge as an owner they going to be less shares less slices of the pie given out and they'll have that cash restricted over time cash is one time pay slice of the pie is a forever pay which as an owner I'm I'm less inclined and then\n\nso I I think that&#39;s kind of the the key highlights good to see the AI revenues up 200% uh it&#39;s good to get that explanation and then Eddie woo the CEO uh proclaimed that they&#39;re going to return to double digit Revenue growth in the

from underperforming GDP in tbal and t-all to dramatically outperforming uh GDP as as the the monster player ### FEATURED_COMPANY_DEEP_DIVES\nand then the final thing I&#39;d say two things that I liked about getting the cash under control first thing was this was a real pet PE mine so they bought $5.8 billion a stock but it was a net reduction of 2.3% of the share count uh because they&#39;ve been doing a lot of employe stock options uh uh Employee Stock plan and which you said when meeting with these people people they were really motivated to get the stock price up because they all have a ton of stock what I&#39;m glad about is that starting last last quarter they started to replace a portion of alibaba&#39;s uh ESOP incentives with long-term cash incentives for our employees

restricted over time cash is one time pay slice of the pie is a forever pay which as an owner I&#39;m I&#39;m less inclined and then finally  they cut 6700 jobs which uh it&#39;s good to see them taking a little B bureaucracy out out of the business as well so Allin I mean this thing looks primed and poised to and when it turns it turns abruptly whether the Catalyst will be some policy from the Chinese government or this 20 billion to 30 billion of new buyers uh or the weakening dollar or the actual change in fed policy where we&#39;ve seen historically dollar goes down Yuan starts to appreciate bond yields Chinese bond yields start to go up a Yen starts to go up uh and and all of these things click all at once but but my experience and just looking at the the history is while they take a long time to turn and we you know two and a half years is a long time by historical standards kind of in line when they do turn it is so abrupt and material and uh maybe you could just speak to that and and any of the other points that I made on Alibaba as we wrap up oh no it&#39;s uh yeah you do an incredible service to your your subscribers and listeners just your death of analysis and um yeah yeah I mean in general I mean I think um you you&#39;ve had a little bit of an unwind in terms of China allocations I think Geographic there&#39;s a geographical that you know a lot of us investors went underweight or exited or were neutral because of the you know Trump with the trade War became the tech war and then zero covid uh some of the internet regulation and and a lot of European investors really got hurt um when Russia invaded the Ukraine because they were very overweight Russia and they said wow if you know if China were you know you Russia was overweight but it was small position if if China ever invaded Taiwan you know that that&#39;s a big position uh within Asia I think a lot of those investors were slower in coming out because obviously it&#39;s an important regionally economically but even going there so they they they were slower to come out and then actually I think investors in China were really the last to come out because they&#39;d say you know I&#39;m still using Alibaba or uh the world&#39;s not ending um and and so that that led to a real capitulation in in January of this year where the Chinese markets really rolled down because there was uh there were literally no buyers there&#39;s um and then there&#39;s other factors um you know actively managed funds have really suffered uh from the flows in the passive funds there&#39;s no dip buyers left yeah you know ETFs are kind of there&#39;s a momentum element You could argue um and so yeah we think the rewind will happen in Reverse which will the Chinese will be buy China yeah and and you&#39;re actually seeing that that in through this southbound stock connect Chinese investors have bought more stock and ETFs year to date than in all of 2023 wow you know just about $45 billion and so in Asia I think the view is well if that Yen starts appreciating that&#39;s a problem to being overweight Japan right that could that could actually and then India to to your point Tom yeah we do think it&#39;s um it&#39;s professional investors are going underway because of the valuations it&#39;s a very retail driven Market it&#39;s actually the largest derivative Market in Asia you know people talk about in the US everyone makes fun of this odte of in you know U but in in you know check it out in in India you know huge options derivative market and when you sort for the largest derivative P positions in in India you got to go way down until you hit the first put wow all calls wow that&#39;s that&#39;s part of what&#39;s you know this retail enthusiasm um because their economy is doing well and Modi um but but t\n\n### MISCELLANEOUS\ner invaded Taiwan you know that that&#39;s a big position uh within Asia I think a lot of those investors were slower in coming

retail enthusiasm um because their economy is doing well and Modi um but but there is  this odte effect I mean they don&#39;t have odte options but but you know so anyway so so a lot of professional investors are saying hey maybe I should be a little nervous about about India and and so I think I think over time um I think a lot of as well as the other big overweight in Asia is US equities I mean it just um I I just I really do but think a lot of this money is uh retail money out of Asia and uh the dollar the dollar declines that&#39;s going to weigh on you know if you&#39;re levered up you know it doesn&#39;t take much until you get really hurt you know as we saw with the Yen carry trade um but I think I think you know you know either elements of that start flowing back Ian that&#39;s that&#39;s been my counsil to people is like hey like I&#39;m not you know you know you know I&#39;d be charging 2 and 20 if I could predict the future right why why would you not take a piece of US tech profit and put in cheap China yeah you know Che China attack like what like just take a little smidge like why would you not you know you know particularly you know with the um election you know what are you know based on who wins what happens with long-term cap gains like uh there&#39;s all these different scenarios like why would you just take a piece you know tell high and Buy Low like why why would you not do that yeah for a piece right um I I think I think there&#39;s an argument we&#39;re starting to see that yeah yeah and it&#39;s um you know it&#39;s the old saying good things happen when you buy high quality assets at low prices I mean it&#39;s just a matter of of it&#39;s not a it&#39;s never a question of if it&#39;s a me it&#39;s a question of when and uh and the same will be true I I love that you brought up that energy analogy in 2020 because it was that same level of pessimism that pensions will never again invest in until the price goes up and everyone chases it and uh and I could certainly see I mean you know mag 7 their earnings growth decelerating from 50% to 20% doesn&#39;t mean they&#39;re going to crash like the Tech rec they&#39;re just going to I think perform less well than they have in the rearview mirror there&#39;ll be a lot of money made under the surface but you can make tons of doubles and triples under the surface uh and the indices don&#39;t don&#39;t do much uh and that would imply that the mag 7 you know maybe they get back up to highs and they just grind for a year you know and and uh and as the dollar weakens we start to to see this diversification so I&#39;m very excited one of the things I like to look at every day when I wake up is your writing on China last night.com so maybe if you could tell people how to follow you where you are on Twitter tell them a little bit about your daily China note uh and and uh and and lastly your ETF and then we&#39;ll wrap up yeah no than and any final thoughts also yeah yeah yeah yeah I mean um you know our such a key thesis at cran shers is providing a DAT data driven perspective on what&#39;s happening in China&#39;s economy and capital markets and uh you know in order to do so I I write you know I&#39;ve been doing it for I think like seven years um China last night.com which is just a brief concise overview of what happened last night in China what&#39;s important and I used it as an element to maybe negate you know some of the popular Western\n\nI mean you know mag 7 their earnings growth decelerating from 50% to 20% doesn't mean they're going to crash like the Tech rec they're just going to I think perform less well than they have in the rearview mirror there'll be a lot of money made under the surface but you can make tons of doubles and triples under the surface uh and the indices don't don't do much. I think great companies in China including Alibaba they're they're putting you know their you know really their wallet where their mouth is and you know if these Tech entrepreneurs are buying back stock that probably means China's economy is not to do a thelman and Louise and go off a cliff yeah that their own company's Prospect like Alibaba is not about to go off a cliff that they see something and they're doing something about it and the question is like what are we as inv investors doing when we see that and I'd say like listen this stuff is volatile I mean um you know it's it's part of a well- diversified portfolio you know these stocks these ETFs two to three times more volatile than the S&P 500 so you just got to volatility adjust your position but yeah we're we're constructive we see an opportunity I mean we're that's self-serving and highly biased I mean that's the asterisk you know well very heavily invested personally and it's been it's been it's been it's been a brutal you know really three and a half years um but you know I think these things do pass for sure yeah well I think we've we've rung out a lot of the downside volatility and it'll be fun to to experience the upside volatility uh when it\n\n### MISCELLANEOUS\nMarket leadership regime changes a super tanker and it doesn't happen overnight. I think there's a huge home bias to US equities but I think it is a global bias to US equities and I would argue that there's some real arguments that's changing and I think great companies in China including Alibaba they're putting their wallet where their mouth is. If these Tech entrepreneurs are buying back stock that probably means China's economy is not about to go off a cliff that they see something and they're doing something about it and the question is like what are we as investors doing when we see that and I'd say like listen this stuff is volatile. These stocks these ETFs two to three times more volatile than the S&P 500 so you just got to volatility adjust your position but yeah we're constructive we see an opportunity. David Tepper just wrote a billion dollar check to buy some Alibaba in the last quarter. What I love about that is what I wish we saw more with American companies when American company stock craters management don't buy in stock the way that they do in China and I love the fact that the Chinese have the right mindset that when the price goes down and you believe in your prospects that's when you load the boat and you buy all the stock you don't crawl under the desk and I think that's going to serve us as owners very very well that they were reducing the float and in Baba's case now even doing it more aggressively and saying you guys have enough pieces of the pie we're going to give you cash bonuses and we're going to let the owners take the ride with us so get in get on before we take off and at year end I think Joe Sai and Jack Ma who's retired from the took big purchase. Just a very solid sign all in all together and they're turning the boat well.\n\n### MISCELLANEOUS\none of the guys that uh I admire quite a bit obviously I&#39;m a Buffett Acolyte and Munger and all those guys but another one that&#39;s more along the lines of my style is David terer and uh he just wrote a billion dollar check to buy some Alibaba uh in the last quarter uh last couple of quarters so um you know another value guy another value guy but a guy with uh you know some dramatic outperformance over decades you know 30% kager over many decades a legend uh and what I love about uh that you know what I what I wish we saw more with American companies when American company stock craters management don&#39;t buy in stock the way that they do in China and and I love the fact that the Chinese have the right mindset that when the price goes down and you believe in your prospects that&#39;s when you load the boat and you buy all the stock you don&#39;t crawl under the desk um and and I think that&#39;s going to serve us as owners very very well that they were reducing the float and in Baba&#39;s case now even doing it more aggressively and saying you guys have enough pieces of the pie we&#39;re going to give you cash bonuses and we&#39;re going to let the owners take the ride with us so get in get on before we take off yeah and you know at year end uh I think Joe Sai and jackm who&#39;s retired from the you know did took big you know made a big big purchase uh I you know I forget what the exact numbers but uh yeah just just a very solid sign all all in you know all together yeah yeah and they&#39;re turning the boat well\n\n### MEDIA_APPEARANCE_RECAP\nwith that said\n\n### QUOTES_OF_THE_WEEK\nWarren Buffett look at Market fluctuations as your friend rather than your

HEADLINES_AND_NEWS\nBuyBacks through the roof you can see it here uh we went oh this is interesting from Goldman Sachs I referenced fast lane and the checkout system that increases conversion from 50% to 80% while just a couple of days after PayPal announced a partnership with Aiden which is a huge payments processor in Europe to offer fast lane and here&#39;s what Goldman Sachs had to say about it uh aen offering fast lane to its Enterprise Merchant and and Marketplace customers fast lane allows first-time users to save their C card and shipping information then automatically pre-fills these fields at Merchants using fast lane for all future purchases this improves guest checkout conversion rate to 80 plus% and reduces time to check out by 32% uh we view the announcement as a positive development for PayPal as distribution for Fast Lane expands expands particularly if offered via aen addan which has strong Global Enterprise relationships in particular we believe the distribution of Fast Lane through similar to branded checkout and other payment methods shows increased ability to compete versus other methods of online checkout we also see this as consistent with Management&#39;s commentary around the potential to unbundle fast lane from branded and unbranded checkout which we believe helps PayPal to compete on a more similar playing field to Apple pay and Google pay uh we see this as a positive for PayPal&#39;s distribution and continued sign of the strong execution at the company since the current management team took the the helm IE Alex Chris who came from into it who ran 50% of the business while over 10 years that stock was a 38 bagger so um we&#39;re excited about that we covered uh Charles this is critically important you will understand the significance of the chart below after you listen to my conversation with Charles Payne and and which you just did and read the article from last week here&#39;s the link to the article from last week this by the way not only goes into our updates last week but it has links back to our original thesis uh when we got involved in the company in May of 2022 at $510 um so per share you will understand as it relates to vehicle incentives one of our loyal podcast video cast viewers hat tip to Stephen Frampton sent us this updated updated chart from Cox Automotive uh and then I&#39;ve made these annotations on it and here&#39;s what we&#39;ve been saying people have been worried oh my gosh dealer inventories are growing they&#39;re increasing incentives increasing incentives are the name of the game when you want volume we are not in the business of Ford and GM making as much money per car as possible we are in the business of Ford and GM making as many cars as possible that is the critical name of the game and so right now vehicle incentives are at 7% of total purchase price in 2017 they got up to 11% of total purchase price and average incentives in July Rose to 7% uh or 33 3,383 per car up from 6.4% in June and the most generous level seen in 2024 incentives are now Higher by 59.1% compared to one year ago when the average incentive package was 4.4% of of uh total purchase price in July of 2023 new vehicle incentives in July were at their highest point in more than three years this is huge this is going to show us big volumes because like I said the cartel that GM and Ford and Stanis had during covid when they could control Supply and charge as much as humanly possible per car um uh is is over okay and now you know the Koreans are putting in cheaper cars and they&#39;re going to have to buy make smaller cars massive cars massive volume and CPS gets paid per car and it&#39;s it&#39;s pretty much the same amount of cars parts per car uh except for the fact if you go to hybrids it dramatically increases the cost per vehicle for Cooper standard in other words Hy hybrids are even better than uh internal combustion and EVS as well which are slowing demand but the big where they make all the biggest amount of money is the hybrids uh I are good uh EVS are good but I think demand is waning for EVS all right Alibaba update so we covered with Brendan the this 20 billion coming in they had a shareholder vote today I&#39;m sure there&#39;ll be an announcement tomorrow I&#39;m sure that went through in which case the southbound link opens which could be as early as September 9th uh we were talking about $20 billion of flows uh Brendan referenced maybe 30 or 40 billion of inflows which would be 20% of the float which would be absolutely unbelievable but I think that&#39;s true like if you&#39;ve got you know if you weren&#39;t allowed to own Amazon for all these years and you have three boxes a day coming to your door and you&#39;re you know buying books and audibles and watching their videos and a Prime member subscriber and all of a sudden you have the chance to participate in that and buy it you&#39;re going to buy it hand over fist and I think the Chinese you know it&#39;s the national champion I think it&#39;s going to be uh um you know over subscribed so to speak in terms of demand so that&#39;s that they went through the historic stuff here next plan the vote is today and stock connect on September 9th you can see in the Bloomberg article also we covered with Brendan the uh 60 basis points on um t-all and tawau transactions which is in line with their competitors JD and Pino Doo has been doing it for a while they&#39;re now going to get that that&#39;s 343 million to the bottom line and more that&#39;s on last year sales so prospectively it starts in September that&#39;s straight to the bottom line and then even the cell side got excited after earnings uh Bank of America came out um talking about um profit let&#39;s see reiterate Buy on improving growth Outlook uh solid in investor return execution profit beats consensus as enhanced cost disciplines across the business uh and then they go through the growth and the expectations Etc so the key highlights here we covered quite a few of them total revenues are up four 4% Cloud business grew 6% uh Cloud adjusted e up 135% AI revenues grew triple digit year onye paying users of Alibaba AI uh stuff 200% quarteron quarter uh International grew 32% K now grew 16% they re purchased 5.8 billion a stock reduced the float by 2.3% that&#39;s going to get better and better because now they&#39;re shifting from all stock option uh all stock incentives to now cash which I&#39;ve been pounding the table on for a year why are they giving away so much stock so now they&#39;re going to do cash I love cash bonuses restricted over time because cash is a one-time payment a slice of the pie is a forever payment I&#39;d rather give them a one-time payment versus a forever payment they&#39;ve got enough stock they have the same incentives we have as co-owners they cut 6,700 jobs so they&#39;re sewing discipline uh and for the free cash flow which we&#39;re going to spend reiterate we covered with Brendan uh people were worried about that they still did 4.6 billion from operations they did 2.3 billion of free cash flow that was attributable to two things just to reemphasize I&#39;m not going to read the quote again but uh working capital as it related to taking down proactively taking down the wholesale I&#39;m sorry the direct sales business at tbow t-all um and um and by the way that noise in the background they&#39;re cutting a bunch of trees on the property so uh just we&#39;ll just deal with it um so that was one and number two uh investment in AI Cloud because they can&#39;t keep up with demand so they got to build new servers new data centers because the compute demand is literally unlimited and they&#39;re the number one player so it all they have to do is suck in all these people now at low margins and then once they&#39;ve dominated everything then they can raise price once everyone&#39;s stuck on their stuff the switching costs are higher than you think it&#39;s a pain in the ass if you&#39;re a CTO you don&#39;t want to switch if you don&#39;t have to so you let you know inertia is the name of the game um internal and external ecommer market share ah this is key so internal and external data about e-commerce players market share Dynamics indicates a positive trend in gradual market share stabilization so they they lost they they stopped losing share and they&#39;re actually starting to regain share is what they said in the Q&amp;A section um also their CMR growth uh the the GM gross merchandise volume growth grew High grew double digits the CMR gr growth the margin on that didn&#39;t grow as fast because obviously they&#39;re they&#39;re now boxing out teu and uh pindu Duo bigger they&#39;re better they&#39;re going to kick them in the teeth the economy is going to recover and then the higher end stuff where which they own uh is going to dominate but in the meantime they&#39;re like we&#39;re going to even kick them where where we don&#39;t play and we&#39;re going to go after them in the low-end lowquality stuff and we&#39;re going to do that for a while which they did and that impacted their CMR but they expect that to catch up to G gross merchandise value very very quickly cuz they had to move fast which they did and now they&#39;re caught up and the margins are going to go back so we&#39;re confident that alibaba&#39;s overall Revenue excluding Alibaba Consolidated subsidiaries will return to double digit growth in the second half of the fiscal year with gradual acceleration thereafter they still have 26.1 billion remaining on the share repurchase availability and as we&#39; covered with Brendan he believes what we believe that they will no they will no longer be limited in their ability to do BuyBacks because they can&#39;t get us uh they they can&#39;t get their cash outside of China uh now they&#39;ll be able to buy on the southbound connect and so they won&#39;t have to issue these convertible preper preferreds and then buy them back to be anti-dilutive so they can get cash out of the country uh out of the country cash they can now just buy stock on the southbound stock connect uh once that goes through and that&#39;s going to enable them to do unlimited BuyBacks to the extent that they want is limited to the extent that they can access cash even though they have unlimited amounts of cash in China they had trouble with the amount of cash they had outside of China that&#39;s no longer going to be an issue uh quote we&#39;ve started to replace a portion of alibaba&#39;s ESOP incentives with long-term cash incentives for our employees start starting last quarter these cash incentives will be reflected as costs while it will change compens lower adjusted eida it will also result in less ESOP delution in the future that is huge ladies and gentlemen uh uh also as far as Alibaba Cloud we are confident that revenue from external customers will return to double digit growth in the second half of the fiscal year with gradual acceleration thereafter this is becoming a growth company again ladies and gentlemen and it&#39;s priced like a cigar butt and that&#39;s going to change and when it changes and rates it&#39;s going to be very very quick expecting double digit Revenue in Cloud accelerate moving forward uh the other thing is the analysts are like aren&#39;t you seeing a Slowdown cool qu what we see certainly among our own cloud customers is that their AI budgets for this year are higher significantly higher than they were last year any Enterprise that is digitized and relies on digitization must be investing it has to be investing in AI all the industry is now uh that are using AI are leveraging it to enhance their competitiveness and efficiency so any Enterprise that&#39;s in any way digitally Reliant will certainly not scale down its investment in AI because to do so would impair their own competitiveness and efficiency so that&#39;s a clear Trend we&#39;re seeing and we are not seeing any kind of slowdown or softening this was a key reason we got involved with Alibaba to start with is their Cloud hegemony why the CFO sees free cash flow decline as temporary which we covered so he&#39;s basically saying um Let me let me explain this I I I it Bears such important repeating as it relates to free cash flow okay because for doing one p business on the one hand you are buying inventory from the vendor on the other hand you sell it and does the vendor normally give you a credit term like 60 days or 90 days if you can make the inventory turnover I.E sell inventory within a short period of time shorter than the short sort of credit term you&#39;re given actually you are generating cash flow particularly if the size is going up you&#39;re generating positive cash flow on the contrary if you&#39;re reducing scale like they are with the direct sales business on purpose uh you will have outflow on working capital but is that is that a temporary impact to me I think this is relatively uh he says is this is this a permanent impact to me I think this is a relatively temporary impact during the process of reducing scale we will see this outflow but when the business size become stable we will no longer see these types of outflow okay so why are they doing the capex that was the second thing that imp impacted uh free cash flow and it&#39;s simply because quote we see a lot of demand a lot of unmet demand from many clients this is related to AI capex uh and you look at the pipeline those clients have you know there&#39;s going to be ongoing demand so whether it&#39;s training inference or API calls what we see we&#39;re making these kind of capex Investments quote as soon as we get a server up a server is instantly running at full capacity there&#39;s that kind of demand so we can expect to see a very high Roi over these next quarters because we&#39;re building compute power to meet existing demand and that new compute power coming online is getting instantly taken up and running at full capacity on day one huge ladies and gentlemen um so high single digit gmv growth double digit order growth uh this quarter some other other C we we covered most of them I just want to get some of these Stars here you can read this on your own the 88 VIP members that&#39;s like a paid subscription like Prime uh increase double digits year-over-year surpassing 42 million during the quarter pretty serious no one ever talks about it uh number of paying users using alibaba&#39;s Cloud AI platform has increased by over 200% quarter on quoter it&#39;s unbelievable um okay uh driven by double digit uh okay uh Cloud grew 6% driven by double digit public Cloud growth increasing adoption of AI related products AI related product Revenue continued to grow at triple digits year-over-year we continue to invest in customers and Technology particular AI infrastructure to increase Cloud adoption and for a the AI to maintain our our market share leadership uh significant double digit Revenue okay so we covered that uh aidc that&#39;s the international grew 32% year-over-year K now the log ICS 16% year-over-year local Services Group 12% year-over-year even the digital media grew 4% year-over-year all right let&#39;s see here some of these key stars and then we can move on we&#39;ve got still a lot to cover this week uh I was going to release Brendan&#39;s interview separately but then I just thought it would be confusing so we put it all in here uh notable okay Alibaba cloud has gained notable recognition as the cloud service provider of choice for AI uh according to recently released Gartner which is the industry standard uh Magic for data science and machine learning platforms report Alibaba cloud has been mentioned as the only Asia based cloud service provider among Global players uh code gener while enhancing s 27 language number paying users on Alibaba Cloud AI platform increased over 200% covered all this covered this covered that okay uh our focus on enhancing user experience by offering quality products at attractive prices with great service led to stabilizing market share of tbal and t-all group as we return the business to the growth trajectory the cloud business achieve positive Revenue momentum driven by public cloud and AI related products maintain our we continue to invest to maintain our Market leadership we invest for growth in our Core Business while reducing losses in other business to operating efficiency which they did a good job that&#39;s why the sell side was so happy uh 5.8 billion of shares late uh repurchases underscores our confidence in business Outlook all right um okay next increase covered that I just don&#39;t want to miss anything because there&#39;s so many important points in what happened talked about the reversals look at these business units Top Line every single one China Commerce up 1% the direct sales they&#39;re winding down on purpose as we discussed the uh wholesale up 16% the overall if they weren&#39;t proactively turning that down I think it was like high mid single digit growth uh Cloud intelligence up 6% you know and then you just go line by line every single unit is up every single unit is up that&#39;s what we call a turnaround ladies and gentlemen that&#39;s why turnarounds are so critical what you need is Cash on the balance sheet and uh or options to pay down debt they don&#39;t have any of those problems and they&#39;re actually reaccelerating so they&#39;re like late stage turnaround now they&#39;re into growth re acceleration can go through all those just trying to make sure that I didn&#39;t miss any key things I wanted to cover here covered a lot of them with Brendan still have 84 billion dollars worth of cash by the way net cash whatever it is 65 billion I think they got 20 billion of debt uh they called the employees which we covered for another stabilization uh triple digit growth we covered that through intensive R&amp;D investment we aim to sustain profitable growth while establishing ourselves as a leading Cloud as a leading cloud provider for AI with healthy profitability and market share leadership uh profit 32% year on year okay so in conclusion our strategic focus is twofold enhancing operational efficiency across all business segments while on the other hand actively investing in the key markets to drive quality growth in scale with the goal of achieving more substantial profitability at scale in the future um winning the Mind share of our consumers purchased 630 million ordinary Shares are 77 million ads for a total of 5.8 billion 2.3% net reduction we talked about the long-term cash incentives this is a big deal increasing investment led to better consumer retention increased the purchase frequency and positive feedback regarding overall shopping experience uh consolid okay Cloud We Believe strengthen our Market leadership 4% okay increasing this investment okay yeah Solutions all right so you can go through this line by line stream okay now as the market share stabilizes what we certainly see in this quarter we can start to accelerate the pace of our monetization efforts that&#39;s what that CMR was the margins the volumes are growing like crazy the margins now are going to re accelerate they can start to do monetization now that they&#39;ve stabilized the ship uh there are a few factors you&#39;ll have to look at first the various new products we&#39;ve launched including live streaming uh including the uh R&amp;B 10 billion subsidy program which resulted in higher user return and high and return to platforms and high user repurchase rates but it&#39;s going to take a bit of time to roll out the new monetization approaches and products for them to gain traction new advertising product we&#39;re introducing uh the first me okay so first they got the traffic second a sufficient number of advertising takeen apart covered that they talk about the 60 basis points on all transactions starting in September that&#39;s huge uh hundreds of millions to the bottom line go looking long run AI okay so they&#39;re aiming to get the approval from shareholders and get it completed before the end of August which means it uh the Chinese could be able to start to buy Alibaba stock as soon as early September um so half of their Cloud growth is going to be driven by AI products uh versus the CPU U stuff uh anyting certainly got that so there&#39;s just so much good detail in here secondly the software service Fe will take ah software service fee will also help on the take rate few other short measures as well so these are the things we&#39;ve currently been why we started to do it because we see growth back on the gmv and we see the sign of stabilizing market share so they could only charge this if they had confidence that they&#39;ve started to regain share and they&#39;re back on a growth trajectory you know you don&#39;t raise prices on Merchants uh if you think you&#39;re the sick the the ship is sinking you only do that when you&#39;re back to growth and that&#39;s that&#39;s where they are okay uh I think the reason clearly a very strong backlog continue investing simply because we see a lot of demand okay we expect to continue to be investing in AI capex at the same Pace simply because we see a lot of demand a lot of unmet demand from many clients and you look at the pipeline those clients have you know there&#39;s going to be ongoing demand\n### TECHNICAL_CHARTS\nand you can see these different um indicators interestingly enough the worldwide box office year-to date ladies and gentlemen what are the top top two films they&#39;re Disney inside out to Deadpool and Wolverine uh was actually the largest R-rated movie box office in the history of box offices so the idea that no one&#39;s going to the movie theaters is apparently inaccurate Microsoft has accelerated heavy investments in AI reason I put this chart is so you can see the magnitude and you can see why that shift from magnificent 7 to 493 is happening and is going to continue to happen uh not because they&#39;re going to crash or anything but because their margins are going to be crimped from all their investment and their earnings growth is decelerating from 50% to 20% doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s going out of business it just means that the relative value is going to be outside those groups in terms of outperformance and we covered some of that Bond Bond and Equity Universe um this is really interesting the value of all Global bonds and stocks is 255 trillion the value of all Global bonds is 130 trillion the value all Global stocks is 125 trillion so when you have a company like you know apple or Nvidia get up to these four and five trillion dollar valuations you know when you back it out and you just measure it relative to GDP and measure it relative to uh the global value of every stock on Earth you can start to see how some of these have gotten a little bit ahead of their skis and if you zoom out as we always say you can discern and take advantage of those um opportunities to stay away so or or uh trim you know as you know we&#39;ve done uh well before any of this uh Yen dislocation and all that stuff was happening Financial assets are worth 233% of global GDP they peaked in 2019 at 270 billion wor 270% of global GDP the value of Wall Street relative to the value of Main Street is almost back at record highs um negative yielding debt has dropped from 18 trillion to zero in the last four years so there was a lot of negative yielding debt if you think of jgbs uh even um real yields on treasuries were negative and now that&#39;s back to more normalized levels uh top five stocks in the S&amp;P 500 peaked at 29% of the market in July of 2024 we said it was bananas that has now rolled over magnificent 7 reached market cap reached a record high of $17 trillion in July 2024 when we were getting out of uh Amazon getting out of Google that we bought in October 2022 when no one wanted it and you can see that that rolling over um 17 trillion again you say wow $17 trillion well they&#39;re great companies okay are they worth one fifth of the entire world of global equities like there are 10,000 Global equities let&#39;s just say there&#39;s probably more call it 12,000 uh Global equities these are you know five stocks should be 20% of all the value of all of the markets in the world it&#39;s a little extreme and these extremes always get corrected as you see over and over and over so they get corrected in part by the others growing and in part by them either staying static or coming in a little bit to more normalized valuations uh Tech Telecom Healthcare peaked at 45% of global equities in July 2024 we haven&#39;t seen that level since uh 22000 okay so that that&#39;s where you want to be where you want to avoid uh you got to pay attention to stuff like that uh this is the cross asset returns from 2010 to 2024 and the thing the reason I&#39;d like to show this uh and boy you guys are getting a lot of value per dollar this week I hope you&#39;re drinking coffee to catch keep up with me here um it the reason I show these is because what you can see is the last shall be first is a very consistent theme just look at gold gold was on top in 2010 by 2013 it was at the bottom by 2016 it was back on top by 2020 it was way on top then it collapsed into 2021 now it&#39;s reisen everyone wants gold it&#39;s going to be back on the bottom in the next few years no it can&#39;t be on the bottom central banks are buying it central banks have been the biggest Contra indicator since the biggest since the beginning of time so if you just do the opposite so they&#39;ll they&#39;ll they&#39;ll buy more and then it&#39;ll change same same if you look at these cross asset returns uh from in the 2000s you couldn&#39;t give away emerging markets in 2000 by 2003 it was the top performing asset did 56% that that year the next year it did 26% the next year it did 34% this is exactly where we are ladies and gentlemen we are going to be um finding ourselves in a position where they start to outperform two years ago they two years ago they did1 19 -2 last two years they&#39;re up double digits they&#39;re just getting started that&#39;s what you saw in 200 2001 and 2002 they came out of the doldrums and then they made it to the top which is probably next year um but just look at these patterns that&#39;s the one thing that I&#39;m very good at is pattern recognition and um um you look at every single decade here was another decade everyone says like oh you know us exceptionalism I agree us exceptionalism that doesn&#39;t mean that International stocks should underperform forever and the answer is they didn&#39;t they outperformed in the80s believe it or not remember they were down on the vulker era then by 83 21% 12% 25% 10% 22% 40% 65% I mean it was the best performing asset in the 80s then the 90 it took the break because the uh Tech took over and then in the 2000s it had its biggest run ever from 2001 to 2007 so what have we had we&#39;ve had the same thing we had it run in 2020 take a break due to the tech Mania from uh the last 10 years and now it&#39;ll be back this 10 years you watch what happens it&#39;s history doesn&#39;t rhyme but it does repeat look at the 70s what Emerging Markets did top of the Shelf every single year I mean 14% 36% 30% in 1973 13.5% when the US market collapsed 26% it was down 15 then it was back up back up back up top of the chart these will be back ladies and gentlemen um all right so you get the point crowded trades uh you can look here too where the dividend yields are by sector uh energy is a big dividend yield as rates cut people are going to want dividends financials reats utilities have already run up ahead of it uh price to earnings where are the lowest price to earnings ratios energy uh financials re utilities trailing price to earnings Price to Book ratios Etc so burden yourself with data that&#39;s all I can suggest uh it works the bull bear indicator is not yet at the extreme bullishness level where you want to sell that&#39;s from Bank of America restaurant spending is falling a little bit you&#39;re seeing that in the lowest end of the consumer uh retail sales though is still strong because in aggregate um people are spending I I think it was like the top 20% does 50% I I don&#39;t know there&#39;s so so much data but yes there are Crosswinds the FED does need to cut it&#39;s not all roses and green shoots uh but if they act quickly enough like they did in 95 all will be well on that front\n\n\n### MACRO_DATA_SLIDES\nInternational stocks should underperform forever and the answer is they didn't they outperformed in the80s believe it or not remember they

there are Crosswinds the FED does need to cut it's not all roses and green shoots uh but if they act quickly enough like they did in 95 all will be well on that front\nhere is  the S&P forward returns 13 26 39 and 52 weeks after the Vick spikes above 45 which it did a few weeks ago and you see on average a year out it's up 14% every period whether it's 4 we 8 week on average it's up and that's what we're seeing next returns were positive when the First Rate cut did not prede a recession and you can see six months later so even if the market goes down a little bit after the first cut what they're trying to say\n\n### MACRO_DATA_SLIDES\nhere is the S&amp;P forward returns 13 26 39 and 52 weeks after the Vick spikes above 45 which it did a few weeks ago and you see on average a year out it&#39;s up 14% every period whether it&#39;s 4 we 8 week on average it&#39;s up and that&#39;s what we&#39;re seeing next returns were positive when the First Rate cut did not prede a recession and you can see six months later so even if the market goes down a little bit after the first cut what they&#39;re trying to say\n### MISCELLANEOUS\nhere is uh 3 months and 6 months later on average it&#39;s up pretty materially over time and if there&#39;s no recession which at 2% GDP growth it&#39;s going to be tough to get two quarters of negative GDP unless they do something stupid and they don&#39;t cut then like you&#39;re going to have deflation uh and a huge problem but um leaving that aside dividend yield is where the action is at inexpensive versus history the cheapest it&#39;s been since 2002 I reemphasize these things because they&#39;re important and if you get the themes you can make a lot of money again\n\n### MACRO_DATA_SLIDES\nhere is  the earnings growth that we continue to emphasize with the Magnificent Seven earnings growth from 34% to 29 to 18 and then the unmagnify from -4% in 2023 to plus 6.5% this year to 13.5% next year and then look at small caps this is awesome 2023 - 12.2% this year plus 7.3% next year plus 37.6% so if you&#39;re skeptical about small caps because because they had a little sell down because of the Yen nonsense uh you&#39;re going to miss the boat ladies and gentlemen it&#39;s going to move bigly in our view small small size factor is historically cheap versus large size Factor growth versus value expensive on a book value basis you can see growth is like obscenely it&#39;s more expensive than it was at the Tech rec Peak uh value versus growth valuations remain well below historic average uh housing starts that&#39;s a function of rates Philadelphia fed manufacturing that was weak that&#39;s why the FED needs to move uh buying conditions U UK retail sales are re accelerating that&#39;s been a core part of our theme of the UK getting back on track uh S&amp;P historical performance post Jackson Hall so they speak tomorrow uh and the only time they screwed it up was in 2022 last year they got it right 2020 I mean that was a strange year so on balance it tends to go up this yellow line next is the Fed balance sheet has come down quite a bit I mean that&#39;s almost uh two trillion that&#39;s pretty good uh this is probably where they&#39;ll end they not going to be able to reduce a lot more of this cycle but uh they did better than most people would expect without causing a recession expectation of losing one&#39;s job at a record high in New York fed survey uh so so that&#39;s that so you know people are on edge fed fed needs to fix that in the next few weeks long-term inflation expectations at lowest since early 2022 that&#39;s another thing that gives them cover earnings growth by sector that&#39;s for this year com services and Tech were the highest uh energy was the lowest next year is expected to be healthc

policy was this restrictive the FED acted and it was the bottom of equities so look at these four points March 2020 we were one of the few people pounding the table to buy you can review our market watch article I believe it was March 25th it&#39;s on our website of 2020 we were saying we are buyers in the hole and um and it proved to be the bottom two days later literally it was unbelievable um and then um April 2021 OCT 2008 you can go through there a surge in global liquidity is brewing promising a potential economic upswing this is a big deal ladies and gentlemen and um it does support you know first off you got the 30 billion dollar of fed repurchases two you&#39;ve got the most amount of central banks easing uh since the the bottoms in 2020 2009 Etc we&#39;ve covered some of that data in recent weeks so this liquidity surge is not something to be taken lightly which is why we&#39;ve been bullish like crazy since that fourth quarter of 2022 when everyone was hiding under a rock and uh so there you go and and it looks like we&#39;ve got a lot of Runway to go uh Capital spending quarterly so this is what&#39;s going to cause the margin compression Amazon Microsoft alphabet meta when you can visualize and see at at record highs there&#39;s no way they retain um uh margins and then you see storage capacity in exabytes the demand is greater than the supply the same is going to be true for Alibaba in Asia uh TSX for the Canadians the Looney is picking up pace as we&#39;ve talked about but the TSX trades at a record discount to the S&amp;P 500 not seen since 2001

at some the Canadian stuff um TSX is\n### MACRO_DATA_SLIDES\nfinally  out of an earnings recession you can see here from negative earnings growth to positive uh preliminary payrolls through March this was the big chart of the week as we had been telling you I mean it&#39;s like tomorrow&#39;s newspaper today listening to this podcast sometimes um and it&#39;s not because we have a crystal ball it&#39;s because we just pay attention to data and recognize patterns consistently and you can too uh after you do it for 20 years I mean it just comes naturally after 20 years I guess golf&#39;s the same way it&#39;s like I go out and have a blowup round and and then I&#39;m like oh wait I&#39;ve only been playing two years uh and I&#39;m like why you know why aren I scratch or whatever and it&#39;s just like no because you suck you&#39;re new and uh you know and then the next day you&#39;re going to go out and shoot an 81 and you know feel better about yourself and uh and keep keep at it so that&#39;s the way it goes but after 20 years I figure I&#39;ll be pretty damn good at it um all right less robust job growth if they don&#39;t cut bigly in the next few meetings meaning 50 to 75 basis points before the end of the year they&#39;re just blind or stupid uh I think that it&#39;s unequivocal they&#39;re going to start easy with the 25 and then Accelerate from there as needed and temper but this was I mean you know when I think about how off these numbers were and it was it was bothering me because it&#39;s also what threw them off when inflation was roaring because because the jobs creation was uh under reported and now it&#39;s been over reported for the last year by almost a million jobs um this is this is something and you&#39;ve seen the rhetoric come out in the last few days from all these fed officials our focus is now on the jobs report because they&#39;re like wait there are a million jobs less than you report it&#39;s like if a public company reports $20 off their accounting is off the stock will sell down 30% if their financials are wrong this Bureau of Labor can get it wrong 12 months in a row by a million jobs and there&#39;s no penalty whatsoever it&#39;s really mind-boggling the penalty is the fed&#39;s been 300 basis points too restrictive than they should have been had they had the accurate data about the jobs reports so there you go let&#39;s move on to our sler stuff from\n\nless robust job growth if they don't cut bigly in the next few meetings meaning 50 to 75 basis points before the end of the year they're just blind or stupid uh I think that it's unequivocal they're going to start easy with the 25 and then Accelerate from there as needed and temper but this was I mean you know when I think about how off these numbers were and it was it was bothering me because it's also what threw them off when inflation was roaring because because the jobs creation was uh under reported and now it's been over reported for the last year by almost a million jobs um this is this is something and you've seen the rhetoric come out in the last few days from all these fed officials our focus is now on the jobs report because they're like wait there are a million jobs less than you report it's like if a public company reports $20 off their accounting is off the stock will sell down 30% if their financials are wrong this Bureau of Labor can get it wrong 12 months in a row by a million jobs and there's no penalty whatsoever it's really mind-boggling the penalty is the fed's been 300 basis points too restrictive than they should have been had they had the accurate data about the jobs reports so there you go let's move on to our sler stuff from RBC  thanks to my buddy over there um let me just see if we have any more charts here okay fomc mentions of inflation are falling off a cliff of unemployment are rising so that's their dual mandate kicking in revision suggest more moderate payroll growth we covered that non-farm payroll growth revised down 88,000 um this is another chart of median size of new single family homes we've talked about this for a year we said think levit town the houses are going to get smaller not everyone needs a starter home that's 6,000 square fet and that's changing and then\n\n### MACRO_DATA_SLIDES\nfinancials waiting in the S&P 500 was 22% in 2007 all this stuff reversed to the mean was at a low of 10% during the 2020 lows when we were pounding the table to buy Wells Fargo got a double in that and then um now it&#39;s reverting back to Norm but this has a lot of room to run I know we trimmed a bunch of our city and BAC um that we bought during that Regional banking crisis and made it a really really nice trade on uh but we&#39;re we&#39;re looking to find ways to buy it back in and and the reason is hopefully in September October we&#39;ll get that chance and the reason is is because the m&amp;a and IPO cycle hasn&#39;t even begun so they&#39;re going to make money I just they&#39;ve had you know they basically doubled in a short period of time hit the window and then buy back down low and um and that&#39;s what we&#39;re going to hope to do uh Tech waiting as a percentage of the index we&#39;ve covered this back to 2,000 highs it&#39;s uh it&#39;s not where you want to be but money market funds you know as equities go up as yields go down this money has to find a home and um just like it did in 200920 everyone got into money markets in fear and then it all came back into the market and you added 10 more years of a of a bull run uh develop Market government debt as a percentage of This Is Us debt to GDP we&#39;ve covered this highest debt to GDP since World War II had they get out of in World War II they just let inflation R run above Trend if they&#39;re smart they will let inflation run between 2 and 1 half to 4% for the next 5 years and they act quickly enough and that&#39;s how you can inflate your way out of it that&#39;s how we did it in World War II we&#39;ll get the growth why because we got 72 Millennials at Prime working and spending years average age 34 similar to China by the way that&#39;s why they&#39;re going to have one more parabolic run difference is we have a a a large generation after our Millennials the Chinese don&#39;t their toast five more years for China and then bye-bye um just like Japan from 85 to 89 here&#39;s the\n### TECHNICAL_CHARTS\nsler charts just shows the uh S&P hitting a little resistance here and then weekly this shows the September seasonality here so we had a strong August now the only corollary to this is that during election years um well no actually election years are in line with this it&#39;s shows strength till mid September then end of September is where you get the weakness early October you get weakness and then you get a recovery in um in late October into November I think this year might not be till November till you get election certainty unless it&#39;s just showing positively that one candidate is that far ahead this rebound looks like it has a little more to go uh and we could even hit new highs in September in late August September before we get defensive shortterm and what else do we have here we&#39;ve got the NASDAQ recovering back I think that that&#39;s got some room to go midcaps just breaking out we love that story We own a lot of midcaps small caps just coming off the mat this is going to be the whole theme for the next 18 months small caps this is just getting started and this is probably going to go from let&#39;s see 16 to 24800 this probably goes to 3,200 on the Russell at least\n\n### TECHNICAL_CHARTS\nwe&#39;ve got the NASDAQ recovering back I think that that&#39;s got some room to go midcaps just breaking out we

and re accelerating earnings will be down a little bit this year um so all I&#39;m telling you and maybe we&#39;ll cover this one in a lot of detail I can just tell you this I was busier than a one-armed well let&#39;s see there&#39;s two one arm P paper hanger or one-legged guy in an ass kicking contest this morning from 79 when the stock was down 20% we brought we nearly doubled our position and brought our basis down to $53 uh $53 and change per share I&#39;m just looking at the aggregated portfolio so uh wherever there was room so that tells you everything you need does it doesn&#39;t mean it can&#39;t go to 40 it could go to 40 I I literally the anyway the point is it&#39;s generating free cash flow It Now does not have existential risk it&#39;s got a great manager in there so whether it goes to 40 before it goes to 100 or it goes back to 60 before it goes to 100 I could care less I literally could care less all today was in the morning was an opportunity to increase my position and bring down my bases in a great business in a in a good business with great management and uh those are the things you can get doubles and triples in reasonable amounts of time over a handful of years so uh less than a handful of years uh also I have a co-investor named Dan L who is has an activist position in Advanced Auto s and he will continue to put the pressure on but the fact of the matter is without even going into an hour analyzing the earnings call which maybe we&#39;ll do next week um all I can tell you is he&#39;s doing everything he said he was going to do sell off westpack delever the balance sheet grow comp store sales retain his top people build the inventory so people so the uh local garages could get their parts faster than anywhere else make sure they didn&#39;t have idiots at the counter that didn&#39;t know anything about cars so he&#39;s made all those Investments and now you&#39;re going to see the turn just like PayPal everyone&#39;s like oh Alex Chris he&#39;s not going to do it well now he&#39;s doing it and then this then when it comes it comes all at once so we love these opportunities we love the opportunity when we could buy PayPal in the 50s and now it&#39;s in the 70s so you know we do that and by the way if you think you can outperform over time without stepping in in these aberrational periods of dislocation good lock these are Mana from Heaven this is where you make your money when everyone is running out the exit door yelling fire you run back into the theater and pick up all the purses because that&#39;s where the money is made and I feel deadly sorry maybe I won&#39;t in a week for the people who sold to me at $48 and $49 this morning but I can tell you that in two years they&#39;ll be really sorry they sold to me I don&#39;t know in two weeks maybe they&#39;ll be like ah you were a bag holder for me for two weeks I could I could care less that&#39;s why we were R low leverage I know what I own and I use these opportunities Intel is going to be the same story by the way we brought our B is down to 23 and change this it&#39;s like the government won&#39;t let them fail they&#39;re going to have a doop we went through that story last week so anyway it&#39;s just Christmas time is all I&#39;m saying uh United CEO expresses renewed confidence in Boeing after meeting with new leader in orberg I covered that with Charles 14% of PC shipped globally in Q2 2024 were AI capable who owns that Market Intel owns that market they&#39;re going to ship 40 million aips as a matter of fact there&#39;s another article we&#39;re going to cover we we&#39;re um here we go Intel disappointed investors for corporate customers it&#39;s still good enough all the cios are like yeah yeah we like it we we know what it is it&#39;s worked for 40 years we&#39;re good with Intel it&#39;s fine um and by the way this is the key story Walmart louds AI that&#39;s good news for tech stocks okay it&#39;s good news for tech stocks the story the next story in AI is not Nvidia which is going to be effectively a commodity producer in two years when Intel starts competing with them and all these other companies start competing with them and the chips become an afterthought it&#39;s the application and Industrial companies start doubling and tripling because they&#39;re using AI technology off what will become commodity chips people think these Cycles it&#39;s like they keep happening and people keep getting faked out it&#39;s it&#39;s novel until it&#39;s not and um Intel in the land of the boring Intel is King uh so once this stuff becomes commodity Intel will have the Fabs Intel will be able to produce the most boring commodity stuff at scale and pick up share and rock and roll back by uh Uncle Sam himself with unlimited pocketbooks to make sure that that happens so uh the story is going to be how these applications and companies like Walmart and Industrial companies start to benefit materially Alibaba 10cent cast wide net for AI upstarts since 2023 40% of alibaba&#39;s deals in China and 30% of 10 cents have targeted AI startups so we&#39;ve talked about Alibaba is basically like owning a China AI ETF and what they&#39;re basically saying in this article is that some of these Investments are going to be worth so much money like we don&#39;t even know what we own like we know why we own Alibaba based on their core businesses and what is prices what we pay values what we get we know we&#39;ve got a huge bargain we don&#39;t even know what we own all these free options we have in all these AI startups in China that have to get their compute that Alibaba got huge Equity positions for giving them compute tokens which basically cost them nothing in their cloud service other than server racks um and three years out you know a couple of these little baby companies are going to be worth a hundred billion dollars and we&#39;re going to find out we own 15% of it and all of this stuff and that&#39;s just going to be whipped cream icing on the cake so you can read that article covered that covered that cover that uh let&#39;s see what else we got here this yes Disney&#39;s Deadpool in Wolverine becomes the highest grossing R-rated film of all time that franchise is valued at zero in the market it&#39;s going to be valued at a lot more in a couple of years uh dollar hit years low as Traders prepare for rate Cuts we you know you guys knew that was coming a year and a half ago if you&#39;ve been listening fed policy makers flag rate Cuts as job market cools so now they&#39;re Focus Shifting the focus um oh this is interesting City says hedge funds are using dollars as the new carry trades so just as the Yen was so weak we&#39;ve seen our positioning sentiment on US Dollars starting to turn much more bearish you think an environment where people are speculating about rate Cuts has fueled risk appetite so they&#39;re now rather than selling yen to fund other op uh Investments they&#39;re selling the US dollar to fund other Investments and um see the range ceny CL so that&#39;s that and then next is Jennifer Lawrence Gigi [Music] Hadid and uh I don&#39;t know who these I I know who Jennifer lawen oh and Emily Rakowski are now wearing Vans this is dated uh two weeks ago this is Mary Claire uh Emily ralsky Jennifer Lawrence and whoever this is um gii Hadid I guess so as Bracken referen in the earnings call which was actually very positive the numbers weren&#39;t great the the the earnings call was super great and we&#39;ll spend some time on that if you want to be here for 5 hours we could do it today but I think we&#39;ll do do it next week or the week after maybe with um uh Advanced Auto Parts but they&#39;ve got a machine going here so that was an article there US US US Weekly or whatever it&#39;s called had another article two weeks ago August 9th uh talking about Vans featured so they&#39;re they&#39;re turning the machine on now that they stabilize the ship our slip-on Vans the SAS of Summer 2024 that was a little while back small cars are selling faster than SUVs and trucks here&#39;s what&#39;s driving more buy buyers to settle for less there&#39;s interest there&#39;s volume hard to say if there&#39;s profitability we don&#39;t care if there&#39;s profitability all we need is volume for Cooper standard we do not care about Ford or GM&#39;s profitability we care that they race each other to the bottom and put out Millions upon Millions upon millions of cars with millions of billions on billions and billions of incentives and we&#39;re back to 2017 the difference is this time I think we can earn a lot more money on 17 million cars uh 18 million SAR than we did in 2017 when the company was bloated and earned seven bucks and traded 146 so super exciting to see all the stuff that we had anticipated that took a little longer than always always takes a little longer so you can count on two things number one the thesis are always going to take a little longer than expected we have exceptions obviously uh that goes super fast uh and um and sometimes we catch the bottom tick but you can count on two things number one our first buy it&#39;s going to go lower before it goes higher we don&#39;t care our second thing that&#39;s going to happen it&#39;s going to just it&#39;s going to take longer than you expect but we&#39;re still going to meet our IR hurdles over a reasonable amount of time and that&#39;s what we do so McDonald&#39;s to invest 1.3 billion in the UK and Ireland over the next four years it does not sound like a a company that&#39;s slowing it sounds like a company country that&#39;s recovering key thesis there gxo smaller little play Asos which you know again we don&#39;t have a reason to make it a real position yet but we&#39;re waiting for that reason uh with baited breath bottom Fishers snap up Office Buildings at huge discount I cannot say this enough I have a lot of super rich people that are my clients that listen to this um with bees in front of their names with lots of M hundreds of millions of M in front of their names uh that know this this world there this is not what I do but I&#39;m telling you so much money is going to be made buying these bit these unbelievable properties at 80 and 90% discounts um so all I can say is I can see it it&#39;s not what I do for a living but I I&#39;m telling you fortunes are going to be made here fortunes so Arc Innovation fund earnings estimates as soon as unemployment takes up to 5%

at and why I really enjoy your podcast um one we do every week talk about ones that we're considering and why or why not we have an acted some of that comes out of the\n\nJim Jones Tom you always talk

not we have acted some of that comes out of the\n### ASK_ME_ANYTHING_QA\n\n### ASK_ME_ANYTHING_QA\nquestions\n\n### ASK_ME_ANYTHING_QA\n\nsome of it comes out at lib but Our obligation is to our clients first they get the priority of our best ideas before anyone else uh sometimes simultaneously because it it doesn&#39;t matter in the scheme of things but because we&#39;re long-term holders we&#39;re not buying it for a day or a week or a month we could care less about short-term fluctuations but um our job is is I&#39;ll give you an example qxo okay that&#39;s a brad Jacobs company we&#39;ve built a decent sized starter position in it uh I think at around let&#39;s see yeah so qxo is Brad Jacob&#39;s new vehicle he wants to roll up Home Building supply companies uh so we built up a nice siiz position at $12.69 uh across all portfolios and um that&#39;s the good news it it dropped from like 90 it had a small float and blah they did a private offering at n or 10 bucks um so there are two ways to look at this one so number one is is you could say well it&#39;s just a spack who the hell is Brad Jacobs and is trading at six you get $6 of cash for $12 of price that sounds like a stupid deal um except for the fact that it&#39;s Brad Jacobs and effectively his model works and every time he&#39;s done it he&#39;s made his owner&#39;s Fortune so you could say why would I ever pay $2 for $1 of cash he hasn&#39;t done a deal yet and the answer is because when he does a deal it&#39;s not going to trade at $12 it&#39;s probably going to trade up to $20 and then you&#39;ve missed the opportunity and then when it goes from 20 to 100 you&#39;ve only made 5x instead of 12 to 100 you&#39;ve made 8X so if you own it at 12 and he doesn&#39;t do a deal for a year and it drops back down to the cash price per share of $6 so I got 50% downside and 1,000% upside based on his you know if you look at his and maybe one time we&#39;ll we&#39;ll spend it but basically he wants to do 60 billion it&#39;s he always gets 15% of the revenue of the industry he goes into or F I think it&#39;s five or 15% I don&#39;t know it&#39;s it&#39;s he&#39;s done it in Waste Connections which was a waste management rollup made billions he did it for his shareholders in URI uh which was like a 47 bagger he did it in XO which was like a 37 bagger we&#39;re going to get probably a multibagger in gxo over the next few years that was spun out of xbo and I wanted to to be in qxo because I know rates are coming down and I know that the Millennials are going to be demanding huge amounts of new housing for the next 10 6 to 10 years and he&#39;s in The Sweet Spot and it&#39;s a fragmented business run by a lot of Boomers that are retiring that don&#39;t have kids that want to run the business so these smaller businesses are going to be rolled up and Brad Jacobs is going to do exactly what he does every single time take these Antiquated businesses add technology add efficiency run them better and scale them into a multibagger so um so while the value of the cash is only $6 a share I would attribute I would assign him five billion of free value because of there are only a handful of owner operators who have ever compounded Capital over decades at 20 30% for their owners um and to do it multi times none exist I mean there&#39;s there&#39;s not one that has had multi multi- hits other than Brad Jacobs that I know of um like three four five hits some have done two and three uh but compounding at that level so I&#39;m willing to to pay double the amount of cash uh in order to have a placeholder and a nice siiz position to participate in this and I think over the next decade it&#39;s going to be a beast an absolute Beast now so what happens if it goes to if if he Dithers and doesn&#39;t get a deal done for a year and it trades back down to the cash value of $6 then I get to buy more and bring my bases down to uh $9 you know and then then I&#39;ll have an you know uh 11 bagger when it goes to 100 over you know 6 to 10 years versus uh an eight bagger okay but I don&#39;t want it to run away from me and miss the beginning and then only have the chance for a five bagger because if it takes 10 years it starts to run under my required r that I mentally uh focus on so I I&#39;ll leave that at that so um Matt says thank you as always for your generous giving of your time and expertise millions of people should be listening and taking advantage of your informative podcast a lot more of listening than you know because they not only listen through YouTube they listen through the podcast they um any anyway so there&#39;s a lot more people listening than we even know um thoughts on NASDAQ with impending IPO uptick room to run uh n AQ I mean it&#39;s price per Perfection it&#39;s performing like Perfection uh the gross margins though seem to be going down a little bit uh let&#39;s take a look at the balance sheet fortunately I&#39;m not on my regular computer today so all right um debt we&#39;ve got 10 billion of debt and it looks like about 400 million of cash I don&#39;t love that I don&#39;t know it&#39;s high single digit compounder that&#39;s good what&#39;s the free cash flow 1.5 billion what&#39;s it trading at eight times sales 10 times EV PR value eBid 20 times 24 times it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s fairly or fully valued I don&#39;t I don&#39;t see any edge here I I mean this is like you&#39;ll be lucky if you get a double digit return every year uh I I&#39;m not interested in that one um I understand your thinking behind it but if you want to play uh IPO cycle wait for a correction in Banks and buy some of the best Michael digito was wondering if the Hong Kong game flow into Alibaba will be announced on a fixed date we covered that next Dom just a question uh question regarding Dom Durham uh free cash flow drop we covered that that was working capital issue because of the direct sales business and AI investment spend look at cash from operations was fine Jason Lee has the business deteriorated ated since you got interested no it&#39;s improved Kyle Burns um good your tire I don&#39;t like this one because they just have an uncanny ability to lose no matter how good conditions get uh the Koreans destroyed them and they&#39;ve got kind of a levered balance sheet I think this works for a trade I looked at this for a friend of mine uh client actually this week uh it probably works as a trade up to 20 bucks but this is just a lowquality commoditized business um Jason ha hey Jason uh excuse me not Jason Jackson H how are you Jackson good to good to uh hear from you my friend uh Jackson and I got out on the links together in Atlanta he&#39;s a super guy uh using official channels outside your Norm okay grudgingly sold Tesla at a nine bagger so looking for another long shot using the house money the rest pretty much in your faves uh well congratulations on your Tesla trade looking for another long shot I would just say Cooper standard I mean um I think it&#39;s run up a little bit I mean look Cooper standard on 20 is cheap if you know if it okay so all right it&#39;s over $15 now even $15 I kind of like it you know I think this is has a Hu I don&#39;t know maybe you&#39;ll get an look if Cooper standard goes back towards 10 back up the truck um I I think as far as multi-baggers go it it sounds like that what that&#39;s what you&#39;re looking for that&#39;s probably where I&#39;d be focused I&#39;d also have some com stock as well and um and so on all right let&#39;s see here but

forever seems to me every investor believes that Insider management buying is 100% indicator of The Insider management believing the stock will increase and so it would seem to me that t\n\non a debt

indicator of The Insider management believing the stock will increase and so it would seem to me that t here is a possibility that border of management would buy stock to send this signal to the market even if it didn't believe it I can imagine especially in a company with small market cap or wink wink from the board some CEO or components to be used for this purpose are you aware of any studies on this or examples it would seem that would be easy to figure out t\n\nhere is a possibility that border of management would buy stock to send this signal to the market even if it didn't believe it I can imagine especially in a company with small market cap or wink wink from the board some CEO or components to be used for this purpose are you aware of any studies on this or examples it would seem that would be easy to figure out t\n\nINS started buying just before bad news comes out I know academics who do these type of things um I wouldn&#39;t get I mean the one thing you want to consider with inside bu how material is it relative to their wealth that that&#39;s you know if it&#39;s token then it could be to send a message but the bottom line is the the studies show they&#39;re right more often than they&#39;re wrong but you got to do your analysis so like if I&#39;m at a point of buying and then I see insiders buying on top of it I get very excited um insiders selling means nothing because they they only buy for one reason they expect the stock to go up um they only sell for one reason and and they don&#39;t get enough bump like it&#39;s not like the stocks going to go up 10% because the CEO buys stock I mean unless it&#39;s some penny stock or Garbage promote um so I wouldn&#39;t be that cynical about it and I wouldn&#39;t consider it that indicative either because some of these guys I look at Insider buys every single day and some of them are buying stocks that are way up fully valued they in other words they drink their own Kool-Aid uh so I get more interested when people are buying a meaningful amount of stock relative to their net worth when the stock is washed out and the balance sheet is good so\n### ASK_ME_ANYTHING_QA\ncan you take another look at Airbnb at this juncture feels like a better play compared to Nike and Lulu if I had to pick one consumer discretionary balance sheet is getting better and better quarter over quarter uh enough free cash flow to start buyback stock new business model from long-term rentals co-hosting with AI coner founder Le CEO seems very motivated yeah I looked at this a couple weeks ago I think and I just passed I I understand what you&#39;re saying um and revenues are going up that income yeah it&#39;s all recovering earnings per share seven so it&#39;s trading at like yeah good earnings growth [Music] multiples yeah I mean they do kind of have a mode in their space just wondering how much of this like people are starting to go around it like in other words once you rent once then you just go right to the owner like f and some of the other companies that blew up with uh outsourc free cash flow looks really good I think you&#39;re going to get another chance below 100 just be patient on it that&#39;s what I would say um and and go spend a lot of time on the conference calls I&#39;d listen to the last eight calls read the annual reports see what they said they were going to do and what they actually did what&#39;s the balance sheet look like 7 billion 1 billion I mean you might have something here I think it&#39;s a little early so hang in there good find uh it&#39;s been on my radar I&#39;ve just not nowhere near ready to do anything with it Aaron Oda thoughts on Toyota no I don&#39;t want any o I don&#39;t want any original equipment manufacturers I want Cooper standard regardless of how cheap it is but Toyota is the only one who got it right that CEO said EVS are not going to have the demand you think and they said you&#39;re wrong you&#39;re wrong when everyone was ESG and blah blah blah and forcing it down people&#39;s throats and um and he actually had to step down and he turned out to be the one that was right and everyone else you know marry bar you know doing cartwheels in Washington blowing shareholders money uh and uh blew it up so um okay Allan B so no no Toyota for me uh hello send it back in when it hits 140 when it&#39;s down another 20% Allan B thanks for putting out the best investment podcast out there and encouraging the long-term mindset on the regular CH take a look at Portillos oh my gosh engage capital I think he&#39;s a member at my club I was supposed to play with him last week and it rained um that&#39;s crazy okay so he&#39;s he&#39;s in that and he&#39;s in BFC which that&#39;s mindboggling that&#39;d be interesting if it&#39;s the same guy uh got to reschedule that that uh 18 but um anyway pushing for a turnaround at Portillos I was at Portillos for the uh Olympic development thing in Texas and I think we we covered it that week and I like it I just wouldn&#39;t put clients in it but maybe now I&#39;d be interested it didn&#39;t have enough operating track record but um this thing is a great business it&#39;s just the restaurant business is really hard um and right now they&#39;re going to get hit by the lower income consumer for a little while um cash flow I think I&#39;m like okay with this one but I wouldn&#39;t put clients in it as too risky but if you take a Long View I think they&#39;ve got a growth trajectory we covered it in more detail like I don&#39;t know four or five four or five months ago I think it was like December of last year maybe eight months ago it&#39;s just growing very slowly uh what&#39;s the cash flow like I think they were burning cash at the time too which bothered me a little bit yeah still negative free cash flow it&#39;s just not a great business it&#39;s a good business a good product it&#39;s just not a great business from a stock standpoint it&#39;s too slow for a business that that that small the growth rate is too low so that&#39;s why it&#39;s like a past it&#39;ll probably work you probably get a double on it but Len McAdams uh could you take a look at Cleveland Cliffs uh yeah that&#39;s in materials I&#39;ve looked at it I like that that guy we we actually talked about this two weeks ago so I&#39;m not going to do it again but thanks for tuning in Len Eric Haney and I said me it&#39;s a meth for me it&#39;ll probably be okay but not for me um I do want to get materials exposure Cliffs all right let me take another look at it going to be having dinner late tonight for my my awesome viewers want me to look at Cliffs let&#39;s see here all right free cash flows good revenues are okay I mean send it back in if it gets to 10 or 9 uh um W it&#39;s a lot of free cash FL what&#39;s the balance sheet look like 3.5 billion on 1002 so that that&#39;s their problem is their balance sheet so you got to know when all of their debt matures what are the terms uh and on that basis then you know I don&#39;t think they&#39;re going to have solvency risk but you know the number one reason thing you need to figure out is why is it down what&#39;s the bearish thesis and why is that incorrect I mean it&#39;s obviously just I just don&#39;t like this type of business that much um yeah so I&#39;m agnostic on that one um Eric Haney big fan for over three years my man good for you thank you for all you do thoughts on atkr this looks like a broken stock what do they do cash flows rolling over their revenues are rolling over um electrical infrastructure products um yeah I just want to know what the turnaround plan is because that&#39;s a pretty precipitous drop in revenue and free cash flow free cash flows haved almost haved in the last couple of years and then uh M yeah I see what you&#39;re seeing I mean just help me understand why these revenues are going to re accelerate and I&#39;d be more interested but it&#39;s from 4 billion down to 3.9 down to 3.2 that&#39;s a big drop um so what&#39;s the plan to stop the bleeding and start to turn it around and then from there you might have something I mean it&#39;s down a bit it was a grow goo growth company for a while 14 to 193 but you know yeah it&#39;s dropped 50% but these broken stocks man once they hurt the institutions could it bounce right back up like it did in 2022 yeah um I don&#39;t know my I don&#39;t know my Spidey extense just says to avoid it for a little while wait for more pain and then revisit it and keep following the thesis remember this business you get paid for inaction versus action you&#39;re much better with errors of omission than errors of commission so be willing to let a few get away from you uh it&#39;s just the way it goes and that that&#39;s good because if you chase every shiny object um you&#39;re just going to spread too thin and you wind up hurt more often you know you want to go in when everything&#39;s pointing in your favor it&#39;s perfectly it&#39;s a fat pitch down the middle and you knock it out of the park so\n\n### ASK_ME_ANYTHING_QA\nwhy is it down what's the bearish thesis

because I know a lot of you want to get to that right now uh the first one we&#39;re going to cover is vne and Company I want to thank Stuart vanney Christian dagger and Preston Melle for having me on we discussed um PayPal and gxo and PayPal is important PayPal&#39;s been up went from 59 to 72 in the last couple of two three weeks uh you want to hear about that and here we go cuz we have a nice rally going on our hands here Dow up 300 NASDAQ up 250 it&#39;s come down a little bit from where we open the market but that&#39;s still solid rally Thomas Hayes joins me to inspect this market gain here um let me get this right I read your stuff you&#39;re suggesting we get a bit of a dip in the relatively near term and then at the end of the year a nice solid re year end rally is that it I think in the short term stew when the music is playing you got to get up and dance that&#39;s what we&#39;re going to do for the next few weeks however we&#39;ve got the first fed cut coming in September I think it&#39;s going to be a case of buy the rumor sell the news a little volatility after that first cut a little volatility into the uncertainty of the election once that&#39;s resolved we get a year- end rally no we get a year end rally we get a year profits are strong enough to justify that and rates are down far enough to justify that year-end rally that&#39;s right we&#39;ve got estimated 15.2% earnings growth for 2025 uh things are strong we just saw earning season up 10.8% versus 88.9% estimates margins are holding in there so and estimates are actually steadily climbing up so on balance Things Are strong little strength here enjoy the fun the next few weeks get a little defensive ahead of the election and then year end rally uh we&#39;re constructive uh looking out in the intermediate term do we get a year-end rally of carel Harris is the next president of the United States I don&#39;t want to get political with you but that&#39;s an important question it&#39;s no question I think the number one thing for the stock market look one candidate is pro business one candidate is pro government so t\n\nhere is  that dichotomy right there what the stock market needs to see historically is gridlock they want politicians to be able to do less so so long as one party doesn&#39;t get all three branches then we&#39;ll be certainly okay you got a couple of stock picks I want to start with gxo Logistics where is  it now 48 bucks a share where&#39;s it going okay this stock fell 50% why they do Outsource supply chain and Logistics management the reason is because you saw the shift from Goods during covid to Services that&#39;s balancing out that trough in Q4 of 2023 we&#39;ve gone from the destocking cycle to the restocking cycle the operating leverage in this business is huge management is expecting iida to nearly double by 2027 so that implies the stock could not only double but you get multiple expansion once they get the double digigit earnings growth and double digigit Revenue growth back so we think this stock can go up to $100 over the next 24 to 36 months too no you really do like it the next one is Paypal okay everyone hates this yeah uh this is a great business why is it a great business cuz Alex Chris came from into it he ran half the business at into it the stock was a 38 bagger while he was there he&#39;s coming to PayPal he&#39;s increasing the margins he&#39;s got this uh branded checkout called uh that increases conversion to 50% at at the checkout to 80% what does that mean it means he can charge more so margins are going up they were supposed to do $5 billion of free cash flow this year he said no we&#39;re not going to do five billion we&#39;re going to do six billion oh and by the way we&#39;re not going to buy back $5 billion of stock we&#39;re going to buy back $6 billion of stock this thing is turning the corner $4 29 million accounts 10% of global Enterprise spend when you take an Uber stew I know you love to take Ubers that goes through PayPal through brain tree you don&#39;t see PayPal but PayPal&#39;s getting a piece that action $500 billion of of A5 trillion over the stock sorry you went through all this very complicated reasoning on those two stocks you never look down you haven&#39;t got any notes in front of you falling your head very impressive it&#39;s amazing when you have money at stake how serious you get about the stocks well said some well said Thomas thanks for joining us Thomas for soon all right and we&#39;re back and then on Friday I joined Charles Payne on Fox Business want to thank Charles Nick Palazo for having me on this was an exciting segment we discussed all kinds of seasonality and everything else the elections but we discussed Boeing and we discussed Cooper standard I want you to listen closely to this one this is another one that&#39;s on the move again excited about that [Music] all right so my next see notes that earnings margins and estimates that they&#39;ve held up but the Cavalry has to come no later than September joining me now great Hill Capital chairman Thomas Hayes all right Thomas who&#39;s coming to the rescue well I think it&#39;s time for the FED to come to the rescue uh we have a little bit of election year seasonality right now we&#39;ve got this August strength which is normal since 1955 August is strong the early part of in in in election years years since 1955 so you get a strong August you get strong first half of September but interestingly enough it rolls over late September early October which is coincident with the Cavalry coming doing the first cut and what we also know historically is the market tends to sell off after the first cut even though it&#39;s often up 12 months out Etc so I think uh a little bit of strength let&#39;s let&#39;s dance while they&#39;re playing the music right and then get a little conservative ahead of the election and and year and rally so that&#39;s interesting because I I I&#39;ve always kind of seen you as a Buy and Hold not necessar guy who says hey we&#39;ve got to be a little bit Nimble here yeah uh also though uh you&#39;re not big on a ma 7even you do point out that their earnings growth is decelerating while the rest of the S&amp;P is going up but I I I&#39;m going to put on the screen now this is just one of the it&#39;s decelerating but for next year Max 7 that 20% is still the best outside the Russell 2000 right so even though equal weight is going to go to 12% from 5% and overall S&amp;P 7 14% from 7% 20% is nothing to sneeze at is it no it&#39;s absolutely not and I think the theme\n\n### MEDIA_APPEARANCE_RECAP\nwe discussed Boeing and we discussed Cooper standard I want you to listen closely to this one this is another one that&#39;s on the move again excited about that all right so my next see notes that earnings margins and estimates that they&#39;ve held up but the Cavalry has to come no later than September joining me now great Hill

go to 12% from 5% and overall S&amp;P 7 14% from 7% 20% is nothing to sneeze at is it no it&#39;s absolutely not and I think the theme Here is  that they&#39;re going to have relative underperformance so under the surface the unmagnify you&#39;re going to see some stocks double you&#39;re going to see some stock triple there aren&#39;t many mag s stocks you&#39;re going to see double and triple over the next 12 18 24 months you&#39;re actually seeing it with all these activists buying up these cheap stocks that we&#39;re talking about you know like Nike you saw Amman like Ulta you saw birkshire like Starbucks you see Elliott so you see the activist starting to get into this cheap value and I think that&#39;s going to be the theme for the next 18 months I&#39;ve been pointing that out to my subscribers as well you could see it in some of these been some of these sessions we like whoa this is and these are names that are huge and just you know that you can sleep at night right and you know listen new management is amazing I love when a company brings on New Management um okay let&#39;s talk about money supply before we get to the stocks because money supply you saying is picking up so between money supply picking up and a friendly or fed isn&#39;t that a pretty good gust of win in the Sounds in the market no question about it so I think we get through this period here little bit of strength little weakness a little uncertainty ahead of the election but you cannot fight the increased money supply half a trillion dollars since the beginning of the year the FED will start to ease all the risk that we&#39;re seeing the cracks onto the surface defaults increasing auto loans delinquencies Etc they need the Cavalry needs to come to ameliorate that because if you get into a situation we saw little cracks in the labor market if they let that go we could start to face deflation and deflation is very hard to fix inflation they can manage I got one minute let&#39;s go over two stocks Boeing speaking of New Management now it wasn&#39;t Larry col which I&#39;m glad because I own G stock but this guy&#39;s got a got a pretty good resume yeah Kelly ortberg he uh Rockwell Collins he got there it was A7 billion market cap in 2012 he sold the business for 30 billion 6 years later this this guy knows how to create shareholder value in Industrials and the does he know how to keep a door on a plane well this is the beauty\n\nat Boeing we&#39;re going to have an engineer versus a Salesman running the company his first day he spent on the floor of the factory and the United CEO he met with yesterday he says I&#39;ve got renewed confidence in Boeing now that I&#39;ve met with the new CEO this is a great thing at the end of the day it&#39;s a duopoly it&#39;s good to be the king if you don&#39;t want to play it&#39;s not only a duopoly but if you look at the demand for aircraft commercial aircraft for the next 20 years this was a stock that I used to tell people never to sell and it&#39;s almost going to get back there less than 30 seconds um uh Cooper standard what is yeah we bought this in May of 2022 at $510 s they refinanced the debt went up to 22 now it&#39;s back down to 13 we haven&#39;t sold a share we bought more shares and I&#39;ll tell you why every single cycle in the last 45 years you&#39;ve had 18 million SAR is the peak the sell through total vehicle sales in the United States we&#39;re at 15.8 right now if they just get to 16.1 forget about 18 which they&#39;ll do this cycle the the business is going to earn $3 a share you add a trough multiple of 10 times you got a $30 stock you add a peak multiple of 20 times you have a $60 stock and God forbid we actually get to $18 million SAR Peak this thing could fly so we&#39;re excited about this one\n### MEDIA_APPEARANCE_RECAP\nI went over to Yahoo finance to talk with Julie Heyman uh about uh one stock to uh one stock that we like and one one stock sector that we would avoid want to thank Haley mark and Julie Hyman for having me on there it&#39;s a big noisy Universe of stocks out there welcome to goodbye or goodbye our goal to help cut through that noise to navigate the best moves for your portfolio today we&#39;re taking a look at cyclical and defensive stocks I&#39;m here with Thomas Hayes Great Hall Capital chairman and managing member thanks for being this home good to see you so the your buy stock is a cyclical stock right so we&#39;re talking about gxo Logistics this stock has not done great over the past year it&#39;s down a little more than 20% this is one of the spins of the former XPO Logistics which is Brad Jacobs creation and um you like that uh he is involved in this particular company as well yeah Brad Jacobs has the mightest touch if you got involved when he did United Rentals you made a 47 bagger if you got involved when he got involved in xbo logistics if you invested 1 million you got 30 1 million so he knows how to create value for shareholders so you ask well then why is the stock down so much that would be my next question yes so um this business does well they get paid for Outsource Goods okay so they do supply chain Outsource Logistics and there was a huge demand for goods during covid and then the demand shifted to services and their business the stock basically collapsed the business did okay and now that has troughed Okay so we&#39;ve gone from the destocking cycle which troughed in Q4 of 2023 and now we&#39;re starting the restocking cycle and they have huge Tailwinds behind them and basically operate in a duopoly with DHL so let&#39;s talk about the potential growth then you&#39;re looking iida basically doubling by 2027 this is guidance from the company they expect eida to nearly double by 2027 and what&#39;s interesting about that Julie is not just W well if eida doubles maybe the stock could double when you get that type of double digit growth rate back both on the top line and the bottom line you get multiple expansions so not only will the business do well but the multiple applied to the stock could actually expand in the meantime and that&#39;s why we see reasonably significant upside to this over the next two to three years that&#39;s we kind of jumped the third point a little bit in terms of that restocking cycle just starting but it&#39;s interesting when you talk about gxo and DHL I mean if what&#39;s also interesting about that is like I think everybody knows DHL as a household name gxo is sort of less known or recognized yeah he&#39;s not great with branding but he makes billions of dollars for his owners I got to be honest I mean he consistently does that you know they said something on the most recent conference call last holiday season was actually kind of a disappointment for gxo for the retailers Etc and what they&#39;re seeing right now in the month of August he&#39;s saying the clients are getting ready for a good holiday season it won&#39;t be shoot the lights out holiday season but it will be more in line with a normalized holiday season not a disappointment restocking is happening this is very positive Tailwind for gxo and uh they just completed the Winton acquisition in the UK so they they get close over 50% of their business from Europe UK is recovering Europe&#39;s recovering they just did a huge warehouse for Levis in Germany they&#39;re getting industrial business from uh different manufacturers like Boeing Etc uh all over the world so they&#39;re expanding verticals they&#39;re increasing the duration of contracts with their clients and it&#39;s a very sticky business once they outsourc their business to you you got them for life all right so what could go wrong well if it&#39;s a cyclical stock yeah and that you know restocking cycle doesn&#39;t materialize that would be bad news yeah that&#39;s a big thing I I think right now the only thing that could cause the recession is If the Fed Dithers uh they do need to go in September we saw starting to see some cracks in the labor market starting to see some cracks and defaults Rising even though they&#39;re historically low auto loan defaults Etc so if they move in September I think we&#39;ve got the head we&#39;ve got the Tailwinds from earnings we&#39;ve got the Tailwinds from GDP and this will be Off to the Races but if they get too cute with their Cuts uh that could be a problem gotcha okay now let&#39;s get to your goodbye stock and this one&#39;s a little contrarian here Tom we&#39;re talking about utilities the XL you know this group has been one of the winners of the year right and it&#39;s up almost 20% over the past year but you say let&#39;s hit the pause button and in part is that after the big runup that we have had yeah we were pounding the table last fall when you couldn&#39;t give away utilities everyone said no one needs energy anym I don&#39;t know what people were thinking but basically there was an expectation about rates that&#39;s different than the expectation right now so this has rallied on two basic things first of all as a group this is a defensive sector it&#39;s up 5050 % in less than a year so that tells me it&#39;s a little bit overdone here uh you know that that&#39;s a significant move and the the basis for this runup uh the AI narrative which is slowing down that that trade is cooling uh and cutting rates it&#39;s almost a buy the rumor maybe sell the news here right in other words people were buying an anticipation of the rate Cuts perhaps once they arrive the trade will lose some steam you think and\n\nutilities the exact it&#39;s the opposite of the other ones it&#39;s opposite day if we if the fed dids and we go into a recession you want to be in defensives and this would do well although given the multiple expansion that they&#39;ve had already it&#39;s like I don&#39;t see where the additional upside comes from well or or I guess if you have the continuation of the AI trade and you know is are the fortunes of Nvidia The Fortunes of the utilities for example as we continue to see a build out of AI infrastructure and the demand for power yeah it&#39;s part of it yes uh but I think a better derivative way to play that is through natural gas and I think those stocks are beaten down so these have priced in the possibility of great things happen the natural gas stocks are are trading like they&#39;re dead all right save that for another ### MEDIA_APPEARANCE_RECAP\nI want to thank meta Singh for having me in her article on Reuters about the election uh and I want to thank Reuters for having me on their article about the new CEO at Starbucks ### FEATURED_COMPANY_DEEP_DIVES\nwe covered so much in detail about China the economy policy Alibaba other companies this chart right here uh the hangsang index I refer to numerous times during the conversation so you want to have this in front of you so you can see what I&#39;m referencing uh this is critically important to getting the most value so\n\n### MEDIA_APPEARANCE_RECAP\nwith that said\n\n### MEDIA_APPEARANCE_RECAP\nwith that said",
    "FEATURED_COMPANY_DEEP_DIVES": "\n\nwe discussed um PayPal and gxo and PayPal is important PayPal&#39;s been up went from 59 to 72 in the last couple of two three weeks uh you want to hear about that and here we go cuz we have a nice rally going on our hands here Dow up 300 NASDAQ up 250 it&#39;s come down a little bit from where we open the market but that&#39;s still solid rally Thomas Hayes joins me to inspect this market gain here um let me get this right I read your stuff you&#39;re suggesting we get a bit of a dip in the relatively near term and then at the end of the year a nice solid re year end rally is that it I think in the short term stew when the music is playing you got to get up and dance that&#39;s what we&#39;re going to do for the next few weeks however we&#39;ve got the first fed cut coming in September I think it&#39;s going to be a case of buy the rumor sell the news a little volatility after that first cut a little volatility into the uncertainty of the election once that&#39;s resolved we get a year- end rally no we get a year end rally we get a year profits are strong enough to justify that and rates are down far enough to justify that year-end rally that&#39;s right we&#39;ve got estimated 15.2% earnings growth for 2025 uh things are strong we just saw earning season up 10.8% versus 88.9% estimates margins are holding in there so and estimates are actually steadily climbing up so on balance Things Are strong little strength here enjoy the fun the next few weeks get a little defensive ahead of the election and then year end rally uh we&#39;re constructive uh looking out in the intermediate term do we get a year-end rally of carel Harris is the next president of the United States I don&#39;t want to get political with you but that&#39;s an important question it&#39;s no question I think the number one thing for the stock market look one candidate is pro business one candidate is pro government so t### FEATURED_COMPANY_DEEP_DIVES\nhere is  that dichotomy right there what the stock market needs to see historically is gridlock they want politicians to be able to do less so so long as one party doesn&#39;t get all three branches then we&#39;ll be certainly okay you got a couple of stock picks I want to start with gxo Logistics w\n\nhere is  that dichotomy right there what the stock market needs to see historically is gridlock they want politicians to be able to do less so so long as one party doesn&#39;t get all three branches then we&#39;ll be certainly okay you got a couple of stock picks I want to start with gxo Logistics where is  it now 48 bucks a share where&#39;s it going okay this stock fell 50% why they do Outsource supply chain and Logistics management the reason is because you saw the shift from Goods during covid to Services that&#39;s balancing out that trough in Q4 of 2023 we&#39;ve gone from the destocking cycle to the restocking cycle the operating leverage in this business is huge management is expecting iida to nearly double by 2027 so that implies the stock could not only double but you get multiple expansion once they get the double digigit earnings growth and double digigit Revenue growth back so we think this stock can go up to $100 over the next 24 to 36 months too no you really do like it the next one is Paypal okay everyone hates this yeah uh this is a great business why is it a great business cuz Alex Chris came from into it he ran half the business at into it the stock was a 38 bagger while he was there he&#39;s coming to PayPal he&#39;s increasing the margins he&#39;s got this uh branded checkout called uh that increases conversion to 50% at at the checkout to 80% what does that mean it means he can charge more so margins are going up they were supposed to do $5 billion of free cash flow this year he said no we&#39;re not going to do five billion we&#39;re going to do six billion oh and by the way we&#39;re not going to buy back $5 billion of stock we&#39;re going to buy back $6 billion of stock this thing is turning the corner $4 29 million accounts 10% of global Enterprise spend when you take an Uber stew I know you love to take Ubers that goes through PayPal through brain tree you don&#39;t see PayPal but PayPal&#39;s getting a piece that action $500 billion of of A5 trillion over the stock sorry you went through all this very complicated reasoning on those two stocks you never look down you haven&#39;t got any notes in front of you falling your head very impressive it&#39;s amazing when you have money at stake how serious you get about the stocks well said some well said Thomas thanks for joining us Thomas for soon all right and we&#39;re back and then on Friday I joined Charles Payne on Fox Business want to thank Charles Nick Palazo for having me on this was an exciting segment we discussed all kinds of seasonality and everything else the elections but we discussed Boeing and we discussed Cooper standard I want you to listen closely to this one this is another one that&#39;s on the move again excited about that [Music] all right so my next see notes that earnings margins and estimates that they&#39;ve held up but the Cavalry has to come no later than September joining me now great Hill Capital chairman Thomas Hayes all right Thomas who&#39;s coming to the rescue well I think it&#39;s time for the FED to come to the rescue uh we have a little bit of election year seasonality right now we&#39;ve got this August strength which is normal since 1955 August is strong the early part of in in in election years years since 1955 so you get a strong August you get strong first half of September but interestingly enough it rolls over late September early October which is coincident with the Cavalry coming doing the first cut and what we also know historically is the market tends to sell off after the first cut even though it&#39;s often up 12 months out Etc so I think uh a little bit of strength let&#39;s let&#39;s dance while they&#39;re playing the music right and then get a little conservative ahead of the election and and year and rally so that&#39;s interesting because I I I&#39;ve always kind of seen you as a Buy and Hold not necessar guy who says hey we&#39;ve got to be a little bit Nimble here yeah uh also though uh you&#39;re not big on a ma 7even you do point out that their earnings growth is decelerating while the rest of the S&amp;P is going up but I I I&#39;m going to put on the screen now this is just one of the it&#39;s decelerating but for next year Max 7 that 20% is still the best outside the Russell 2000 right so even though equal weight is going to go to 12% from 5% and overall S&amp;P 7 14% from 7% 20% is nothing to sneeze at is it no it&#39;s absolutely not and I think the theme\n\n### FEATURED_COMPANY_DEEP_DIVES\nactivists buying up these cheap stocks that we're talking about you know like Nike you saw Amman like Ulta you saw birkshire like Starbucks you see Elliott so you see the activist starting to get into this cheap value and I think that's going to be the theme for the next 18 months I've been pointing that out to my subscribers as well you could see it in some of these been some of these sessions we like whoa this is and these are names that are huge and just you know that you can sleep at night right and you know listen new management is amazing I love when a company brings on New Management um okay let's talk about money supply before we get to the stocks because money supply you saying is picking up so between money supply picking up and a friendly or fed isn't that a pretty good gust of win in the Sounds in the market no question about it so I think we get through this period here little bit of strength little weakness a little uncertainty ahead of the election but you cannot fight the increased money supply half a trillion dollars since the beginning of the year the FED will start to ease all the risk that we're seeing the cracks onto the surface defaults increasing auto loans delinquencies Etc they need the Cavalry needs to come to ameliorate that because if you get into a situation we saw little cracks in the labor market if they let that go we could start to face deflation and deflation is very hard to fix inflation they can manage I got one minute let's go over two stocks Boeing speaking of New Management now it wasn't Larry col which I'm glad because I own G stock but this guy's got a got a pretty good resume yeah Kelly ortberg he uh Rockwell Collins he got there it was A7 billion market cap in 2012 he sold the business for 30 billion 6 years later this this guy knows how to create shareholder value in Industrials and the does he know how to keep a door on a plane well this is the beauty finally  at Boeing we're going to have an engineer versus a Salesman running the company his first day he spent on the floor of the factory and the United CEO he met with yesterday he says I've got renewed confidence in Boeing now that I've met with the new CEO this is a great thing at the end of the day it's a duopoly it's good to be the king if you don't want to play it's not only a duopoly but if you look at the demand for aircraft commercial aircraft for the next 20 years this was a stock that I used to tell people never to sell and it's almost going to get back there less than 30 seconds um uh Cooper standard what is yeah we bought this in May of 2022 at $510 s they refinanced the debt went up to 22 now it's back down to 13 we haven't sold a share we bought more shares and I'll tell you why every single cycle in the last 45 years you've had 18 million SAR is the peak the sell through total vehicle sales in the United States we're at 15.8 right now if they just get to 16.1 forget about 18 which they'll do this cycle the the business is going to earn $3 a share you add a trough multiple of 10 times you got a $30 stock you add a peak multiple of 20 times you have a $60 stock and God forbid we actually get to $18 million SAR Peak this thing could fly so we're excited about this one all right good stuff man I like that you bring these ideas that no one else is talking about appreciate it all right folks K Harris and we're back and then\n\nutilities the exact it&#39;s the opposite of the other ones it&#39;s opposite day if we if the fed dids and we go into a recession you want to be in defensives and this would do well although given the multiple expansion that they&#39;ve had already it&#39;s like I don&#39;t see where the additional upside comes from well or or I guess if you have the continuation of the AI trade and you know is are the fortunes of Nvidia The Fortunes of the utilities for example as we continue to see a build out of AI infrastructure and the demand for power yeah it&#39;s part of it yes uh but I think a better derivative way to play that is through natural gas and I think those stocks are beaten down so these have priced in the possibility of great things happen the natural gas stocks are are trading like they&#39;re dead all right save that for another ### MEDIA_APPEARANCE_RECAP\nI want to thank meta Singh for having me in her article on Reuters about the election uh and I want to thank Reuters for having me on their article about the new CEO at Starbucks ### FEATURED_COMPANY_DEEP_DIVES\nwe covered so much in detail about China the economy policy Alibaba other companies this chart right here uh the hangsang index I refer to numerous times during the conversation so you want to have this in front of you so you can see what I&#39;m referencing uh this is critically important to getting the most value so\n\nthe economy or every government cares about the economy yeah because you know political regime change takes place during financial crisis I mean I mentioned you Smoot Senator Smoot and Senator Holly just like President Hoover did not get reelected in 1932 right you know no different than Boris Johnson or you could actually say you know president Trump you know because of Co the US econ so so and China is no different you know China is not immune to this and so the acknowledgment and and you&#39;re starting to see the super tanker doesn&#39;t doesn&#39;t you know pivot on a dime but so I just say you&#39;re seeing a a change in the tone and tenor from what&#39;s coming out of the government and they&#39;re actually being more vocal and I I think the key Tom is you know there&#39;s there&#39;s a barometer which is that Chinese ashare market now the Shanghai Shen xan that market is not doing great and that that is a vote of no confidence from the Chinese people on what the government&#39;s done so far now now that doesn&#39;t affect us because you know you know the the internet names the grow stocks they tend to list outside of China predominant because they were funded by us private Equity yeah no different than bite dances owned by Americans I mean I just you know this Chinese company it&#39;s owned by Americans stop stop saying that just stop saying but but you know most of the companies we hold in kweb you know Alibaba was funded by Silver Lake right and seoa and you know mo and so those companies the the venture capitalist and private Equity investor they wanted a US dollar exit yeah and that&#39;s why they listed here in the United States or you know even 10 cent is actually listed in in Hong Kong and that was to maximize value right go to the biggest Market possible yeah so uh let&#39;s shift gears one of the things we always say we don&#39;t like to take C country and Company risk at the same time it&#39;s part of the reason we&#39;ve expressed um our um our position through Alibaba and I want to talk about the earnings here first and foremost we have uh something coming up in August 22nd where we&#39;re going to have the vote to have the Dual primary listing uh and then if that&#39;s approved which it appears that it will then September 9th we go live uh in Hong Kong supposedly so it&#39;s estimated if you look at 10 cent if you look at uh Alibaba if you look at mwan mwan when it when it did the Dual primary listing in 2019 it was up 17% in the first month some of the others not as much because they were in Weak markets uh it&#39;s expected that up to 10 to 15% of the market cap could come from China buyers over time so you&#39;re looking at 20 to30 billion dollars of buying power coming in over the next 9 to 12 months uh can you speak to that and the implications you think that might have yeah yeah I think this is um you this is this is a big Catalyst for the company that&#39;s southbound uh stock connect is a program there&#39;s Northbound which allows foreign investors like like you know at at crane shares we do invest not in KW but in other strategies in the Chinese a share market and allows a foreign investor to go through the Hong Kong Stock Exchange and by Shanghai shenzen stocks and the reverse is true with southbound stock connect which allows institutional and uh High net worth investors in China to invest in Hong Kong stocks but it&#39;s not all Hong Kong stocks that have to be Hong Kong eligible and one of the requirement there&#39;s there&#39;s been various requirements um and you some of those rules have changed over time relaxed um but if you&#39;re primary listed outside of Hong Kong you you&#39;re not connect eligible okay and so Alibaba the shareholders will vote you know to make its dual primary which would make it um southbound connect eligible and I&#39;ve actually been I&#39;ve I&#39;ve made some phone calls um you know you know between us to Alibaba to the Hong Kong stock what is the exact date and and and I think people being very Koy on what is the exact date so I you know the the September 9th you know you know we&#39;ve talked about and and you know I&#39;ve seen some people kind of backtracking you know some people saying hey maybe that you know maybe it could be sooner you know maybe it&#39;ll be a little later so so but but but the key is it&#39;s coming and just to your point time you know you know how do we know what&#39;s coming well you know we did some comparisons you know you know 10 cent which um has about about a billion user just over a billion users of we chat uh it&#39;s you know China&#39;s Facebook and you know Alibaba the two main Ecommerce uh Tau and Teo have about 900 million users uh so you could say well what are the number of users or we could look at the number of shares or the percentage of market cap so about 10% % of 10 cents call it 400 billion in market cap is held so so you&#39;d say okay about 40 billion could go into Alibaba um but you could say well alibaba&#39;s you know only about 200 billion so 10% you know so so you know we don&#39;t we don&#39;t know exactly how much will come in it won&#39;t come in day one but you&#39;re talking about 20 to 40 billion yeah uh coming in I mean I mean this is a real number I mean this is a real real Catalyst and um you know you know I kind of D say like you know imagine not being own able to own Amazon yeah uh you know you use it every day and know you know you&#39;re you know I you know it&#39;s like you&#39;re gonna go Coco for Cocoa Puffs like you&#39;re GNA say I can buy the you know\n### FEATURED_COMPANY_DEEP_DIVES\ncountry and Company risk at the same time it&#39;s part of the reason we&#39;ve expressed um our um our position through Alibaba and I want to talk about the

yeah uh you know you use it every day and know you know you&#39;re you know I you know it&#39;s like you&#39;re gonna go Coco for Cocoa Puffs like you&#39;re GNA say I can buy the you know\n\n### FEATURED_COMPANY_DEEP_DIVES\nright you know this company went public back in 2014 so so anyway so um yeah we think we see it major Catalyst um and and there&#39;s there&#39;s there&#39;s other things that I think are going in Alibaba from you know some of the macro um you know there&#39;s been some fundamental reasons why alibaba&#39;s struggled just uh domestic consumption increased competition but you know to me to me you know ultimately Alibaba buying back stock you know they&#39;re opening up a brand new headquarters you know yet those are not things that company that are facing severe hardship do right you know you hoard cash you know you don&#39;t you don&#39;t build a new campus uh but you know if you are a company owned by the founders you know if you have those same entrepreneurs who started it whose net worth is in the same stock as as us those are the things you do you buy back stock hand over fist and you build a new headquarters you&#39;re like okay things are going to get better not worse in the future yeah in my yeah no question about it the the second thing is um when they are on the uh dual listing in Hong Kong will they be able to buy back stock through the southbound connect without issuing preferreds or are they still going to have to issue preferreds to get cash uh out to do the buyback because because uh that could be another major Catalyst that&#39;s limited their although they&#39;ve been buying back and issuing preferreds at very favorable rates it&#39;s limited their ability to do what they&#39;re able to do uh or potentially want to do without doing preferreds to get outside you know cash outside the borders to buy back stock that&#39;s been my assumption as well that uh you know you know alibaba&#39;s revenues are predominantly in rmbi which is why they did these uh the convert deal um that that you know they don&#39;t have a lot of US dollar or Hong Kong dollar Revenue so I think you know the connect eligibility allows that to go through southbound uh my assumption and I can come back and confirm that um but my assumption is it would go through southbound wow and therefore you know it you they&#39;ve done I mean alibaba&#39;s done such a shareholder friendly move of capping the you know the convertibility to remove the delution I mean this just shows this is a you know the company is being very shareholder friendly they did the first dividend in SE in December of last year they&#39;re doing a164 in dividends for shareholders this year you know this this is a company that&#39;s you know you done a lot of shareholder friendly it&#39;s just if everyone owns mag 7 no one really cares about you know um and then and and I would argue you know other peers in the space you know the buyback yields of companies in the space it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s you know it&#39;s just out of sight out of mind you know um you know there&#39;s there&#39;s other peers in the space have gone down a similar route I mean I&#39;m um probably showing some of my own bias of being uh more of a buyer of baskets than individual plays but but Alibaba I think uh yeah very very I mean that was part of my dinner in Hong Kong with uh you know some folks from you know senior in the company who&#39;ve been there a long time is just uh you know they&#39;re very they have a very high vested interest in seeing the stock go up on a personal basis and um they&#39;re doing something about it that was that was kind of the the takeaways we&#39;re doing something about it and if you know you know there was more of this disappointment that more you know other invest besides you know crane chairs and yourself Tom are not picking up on this um but I think I think I think you know again you know these these regime changes from a market leadership don&#39;t happen overnight it&#39;s and you know takes a little time and i&#39; I&#39;d argue it&#39;s there&#39;s some signs of that and I&#39;m not rooting for us equities to go down don&#39;t get me wrong you know personally I&#39;m heavily invested yeah um professionally I have no exposure um picking up where we left off one of the things I was talking about earlier was we don&#39;t like to take company and Country risk and when we wanted to get exposure to a weakening dollar and Emerging Markets we saw Alibaba as the play to do that number one because it&#39;s a national champion I don&#39;t think that&#39;s changed much uh and number two in poker and I played uh Texas Holden with some friends I&#39;ve had the same group for about 15 years now in poker you like a thing called called outs and what I saw in Alibaba was outs in the sense that the cloud business is kind of in its nent stages if you look at Legacy Cloud business digitization of China is probably about five years behind the digitization of the us and we saw Amazon&#39;s big AWS run from 2016 to 2021 and now we&#39;re shifting into the AI and gpus uh W which they&#39;re catching up on and then obviously you know retailing is a tough business as Charlie Munger always says uh we had some some market share loss but that&#39;s showing signs of stabilization so um so I would say two things um for those folks that um and then the third thing we wanted is we wanted the ability to have some outperformance so we wanted to be a little concentrated if we got the company right and we got the country right and we got the the thing but for those that that are are comfortable with just getting brought exposure because when it works uh and speaking to what you said before you know these things don&#39;t happen overnight but what what we see if we look back at the last one two 3 four five six I&#39;m looking at seven huge draw Downs since 1994 uh even though they all took a with the exception of 19898 which that that was just an acute situation but most of them took two years to build a base but once they turned the turn was very abrupt and and and abrupt in a way that it almost didn&#39;t let anyone in once it started going um so yeah they don&#39;t happen overnight but one meaning they they&#39;ve got to build a couple year base but when they turn it&#39;s like night and day so um maybe speak to that number one number two um if if people don&#39;t want to take company risk and you referenced uh Alibaba being kind of the toll taker for consumption in China uh I know Alibaba is one of your top positions in your fund uh a how can they get your ETF and and B how would that give them broad diversification to to when we do get that uh abrupt move in in the right direction and then opinion starts to follow Trend and and they all go up in concert effectively yeah yeah I mean it&#39;ll be um you know again I think I think one of the interesting things you know um my background kind of on the index methodology side is at the end of this month is msci&#39;s quarterly rebalance and because India&#39;s outperformed China by so much within the EM Benchmark that India will be about 20% of the EM index and China will be about 24% China was closing in on 50% of the index uh preco so so one you&#39;d said this you this incredible Fall From Grace but but mathematically if you think about India at 20% China at 24 well India&#39;s GDP is three and a half trillion and China&#39;s 18 trillion does that make sense to you so so the indices themselves have a little bit of this momentum effect and you know I think I think the you know when you have very you know sector concentration um sometimes that&#39;s ringing the bell and you you saw that in the US a few years ago where you know the energy stocks were yeah you know basically kicked out of all the indices and you know then you know energy had so so I think I think there&#39;s an opportunity for China at this point and I think this index rebalance maybe you know is the ringing the bell at the top on on on the India trade and maybe you know may maybe ringing the bottom for China because you have some of these positive in terms of Economic Policy uh but also just the incredible valuation of these companies including Ali me one time you know stat that that we didn&#39;t and I always love to share that I think you you and your your shareholders would love is that Al Alibaba has very little debt but they do have a few US dollar bonds and and they have a bond that comes due in 2031 and and obviously interest rates have been rising here in the US the last few years so that Bond&#39;s lost about six% uh in US investment grade corporates have lost 7% over the last three years but would you believe that bond is down 6% and alibaba&#39;s stock is down 66 yeah this up by the way it&#39;s almost like in the US when a company gets kicked out of the Dow they tend to outperform over the next 12 to 24 months um it&#39;s funny that you brought up the energy trade because that&#39;s kind of what put my podcast on the map during covid um and uh and we had a huge run because we were buying xon the highest quality in the most dislocated circumstance when when oil turned negative and it was like I think the waiting got down to 2.5% from a peak of 10% and was the exact same thing pensions can&#39;t buy it anymore ESG you can&#39;t own it blah blah blah until the price went up and then opinion followed Trend and now these pensions can&#39;t get enough energy stocks so um it it history really does Rhyme it it it it often repeats and that&#39;s why I continue to emphasize that scenario in 2001 to 2007 because the abrupt move that we&#39;ve had in tech stocks in China uh was very much like that period and then you had the the strengthen dollar go to the weaking dollar I do want to shift gear by the way so Alibaba in in terms of the China Tech index that that&#39;s one of your top couple Holdings what percentage weight is that in the kweb it&#39;s almost 10% wow so that&#39;s that&#39;s a huge position how many Holdings do you have overall we&#39;ve got 32 um you know we do cap of the largest holding at 10% okay that you know you know exchange traded funds are 40 act mutual fund so the Investment Company act 194 so so there are diversification rules we have to abide by y um and and we rebalance semiannually so as stocks go up and down you know you can have movement there but uh yeah I mean we we were very early you know we bought shortly after the IPO that&#39;s kind of what helped put us on the map was uh we were the kind of the first ETF to own Alibaba because we had this kind of FastTrack inclusion um and then actually we were one of the only ETFs at the time that actually owned us China adrs that you know most China ETFs only held Hong Kong stocks so there all these little intricacies to indexing and uh that&#39;s kind of again that&#39;s kind of my background and something I&#39;m into it&#39;s like a cry for help but you sleep well at night but um yeah on you know popping the hood on this stuff really does matter and a lot of the arguments against China is like oh well the it hasn&#39;t you know the hangsang hasn&#39;t done anything in 10 years or Ms but but you know 10 years ago China was the index was 50% two sectors financials and energy wow you know like like you had you know you had no exposure to uh the tech sector I mean the tech Sector 10 years ago in msci China was under 3% of the index yeah but that 3% actually outperforms the S&P 500 over the same time period even even though the Benchmark in the aggregate so so that&#39;s where we kind of say like you we wanted to kind of pull out I call it like the good stuff yeah these grow companies you know the value energy financials Industrials materials real estate those are slower low growth sectors and yeah you you know that was kind of the point of John cr&#39;s Vision in creating crane shares is hey like give give people the ability to segment out these more growth companies but you got to go in and get them because you particularly you know when we started you know uh you know 11 years ago there was you know there was you know no no exposure in the broad Benchmark so um that&#39;s kind of the you know one of the key points about crane then and then providing people with the data you know that every day I wake up and I turn on the you know Financial TV or you know read the local finance and you know you&#39;d think the world was ending in China and you know again you know when you go there it&#39;s it&#39;s very different and um you know streets are crowded the traffic&#39;s terrible restaurants are crowded you know yes there are issues without question but you know I think if if a chinese doctor cured cancer yeah the US headline would be China Fires at doctors right just it just there&#39;s just this constant uh negative narrative and you know maybe that&#39;s where you know the US government needs to justify its existence with a Boogeyman and the problem is US investors are highly exposed to China yeah um and even you know that&#39;s through US multinationals like you know the Teslas and apples and boeings and caterpillars and Starbucks that are doing great in China and you know this idea that we have this huge trade deficit with China is is not true if you take the profits if you take the profits of us multinationals for the stuff they manufacture in China and sell to the Chinese it&#39;s about 500 billion which is the amount of the trade you know the trade deficit is what&#39;s put on a boat but if you include the goods manufactured in China by us multin t\n\n### MISCELLANEOUS\nhere is  no trade deficit but you never hear that in the Press so so that&#39;s a big part of you know an element of our research we want to provide is just saying hey there there&#39;s there&#39;s more more facets to that and then that dat is from the US from the New York Federal Reserve it&#39;s not from us now that that&#39;s really useful so um so if people want Diversified risk they can get kweb with that ticker kweb in their brokerage account um but what I want to talk about is uh just to to um last subject\n### FEATURED_COMPANY_DEEP_DIVES\nhere is  to go into alibaba&#39;s most recent earnings because what is going to be the driver because really honestly the F like if if China all the sudden wanted to get massive Equity inflows probably the number thing number one thing that they could do is buy Alibaba shares and drive the price up 50% because then all the indices would go up and then opinion follows Trend and all the pensions would be like you&#39;re under performing because you have no China exposure and it would just be like the oil thing in 2000 I&#39;m not saying they&#39;re going to do that like the Japan these did but they are in the market buying some equities leaving that aside let let&#39;s talk realistically about the the pluses and minuses because to some degree the health of China equities is dependent on Alibaba because that&#39;s what westerners know yes you have 10 cent speaking about outs we had the cloud we had the retail even fres shippo that thing could become the Costco of China I mean it&#39;s not there yet it&#39;s a couple billion dollar business but um um so so we talked about the the new buyers coming in they also announced something called they&#39;re going to copy 10 cent and Pino duo in doing the six uh 610 of 1% service software uh software service fee on all transactions I did a back of the napkin uh a math on that revenues last year for tbow and t-all were 57 billion so 60 bips on that is 342 million to the bottom line alone that starts in September which about 14 cents a share give or take it&#39;s not huge but but it increases the profitability increases the free cash flow now if they can buyb stocks through the southbound connect and not have to issue converts to buyback stocks that that could that could be a factor but you know revenues were anemic look GDP 5% they only did 4% revenues that&#39;s that&#39;s not great uh but Cloud business revenues\n\naccelerated to 6% uh year-over-year and AI product Revenue grew at triple digits year-over-year so maybe speak a little bit about um my thinking about tab TL has always been like okay TL&#39;s got teemu&#39;s gotten some share because they&#39;re selling like the lowest end lowest margin stuff at a loss so they&#39;re getting share in a weak economy but when the economy normalizes and you want higher quality Goods uh no one can compete with tound t-all so it&#39;s kind of like a d double bite at the Apple as the economy improves the stock does better but as as the economy the business also starts to do materially better because timu is not really competing with them as aggressively in those areas that they&#39;re entrenched for over a decade um uh maybe speak to your thoughts on uh on alibaba&#39;s uh tbow t-all business and then maybe their Cloud business and future prospects yeah I think the e-commerce which you know in uh was you know 15 of the 36 billion in in you know the latest quarter Revenue you that&#39;s geared to China&#39;s domestic consumption story you know about 26% of all retail sales happens online um and and I think you know what&#39;s what we&#39;ve seen what&#39;s weighed on that business is you have this I call it scar tissue from zero Co that what happened in China was different than here and so out of that consumers have been very conservative um and then you also have a decline in real estate prices in China and and that&#39;s that&#39;s upwards of twoth thirds of urban household wealth in China is invested in housing and so as they&#39;ve lost they&#39;ve seen prices for the first time in their life have actually Fallen the the consumer you know they&#39;re being a little bit more cons more conservative I thought there was a interesting quote from alibaba&#39;s you know uh rival uh 10 cent that their Chief strategy uh officer uh had an interesting quote where there he said we&#39;ve seen the government actually rolling out very proactive policies to encourage consumption um that at some point the consumer siment as well as the economy will start turning um and that it&#39;s not that people don&#39;t have money people actually have have money but they chose rather not to spend it and government policies can induce more confidence among the consumer and start revitalizing parts of the economy so so anyway so I think I think you know I mean I like that quote you know from senior man you know senior person at 10 cent but but you know it speaks to what what&#39;s coming for Alibaba and so Alibaba you know in when the when the domestic consumtion piie was just growing growing growing when you&#39;ve got new newer competitors like pind duo duo or jd.com which historically has been willing to really drop their margins to Discount y you&#39;ve got uh bite dance Tik Tock in China so so part of the issue for for alib is when the pi stopped growing yeah started materially losing some market share so so my hope you know our you know our belief is that as the pie starts growing again it helps insulate Alibaba besides the moves they&#39;re making to to head off some of these competitive threats at the same time I do agree Tom that part of what gets us excited about this is the growth in Cloud um the non-china Ecommerce business you know which grew 32% um and then you&#39;ve got their Logistics business is doing great grew 16% so that&#39;s where you know the aggregate revenue for the company grew 6% even though that that Commerce is becoming they&#39;re becoming less dependent on over time um has had some challenges so so so you know we kind of Envision that the other parts of the business start taking up more of the slack and and certainly Alibaba is benefiting from you know kind of policies that the Chinese government has implemented in Southeast Asia in Africa in the Middle East in terms of building relationships this kind of belt and road yeah you China is a benef you know you know Alibaba is a beneficiary of that I mean there&#39;s you know so that you know as these governments do more you know the the President of Vietnam is in China today like you know do you think alibaba&#39;s benefits from that you bet you know not not through subsidies or anything it&#39;s just more of you know as these countries do trade deals you know it opens up the way for Al you know Alibaba doing incredible business in Turkey getting into Europe anyway so so yeah it&#39;s it&#39;s actually you know it&#39;s almost the irony of some of the Tariff talk where man don&#39;t you see how inflationary that is for the US consumers and here&#39;s where you can point to um you know trying to exports deflation and you know anyway so there&#39;s others elements of the business that has have us excited they just historically been really overshadowed by this core eccommerce but but we are more constructive going forward yeah all BuyBacks and dividends yeah yeah and and I think as it&#39;s interesting it&#39;s like the chip bans were the worst thing that we could do from a national security standpoint because what we have ultimately forced the Chinese to do is create competency themselves and all that means is you take some of the best people from our companies you offer them four times the pay and you basically get all the intellectual property transfer whereas when we were just willing to sell them and make them dependent on our drug which was semiconductors they weren&#39;t as urgently innovating and figuring out a way to do do it themselves and I think in some sense the weakness in the China&#39;s economy has forced companies like Alibaba to agressively grow internationally so all these things are going to hit all the cylinders are going to hit all at once they didn&#39;t have the cylinders of trendal and turkey and they and lzada and all these other and and theyve grown really fast in the Middle East and in Europe that that probably would be less of a possibility if China was you know growing the way it was so so as it returns it&#39;s going to be like everything all at once yeah I mean I think it&#39;s every you know every investor in apple should recognize the checkers and not chess strategy of policy toward um Huawei where you know this you know and and their telecommunication business you know have no idea if they were spying or they clearly engaged in corporate Espionage in the past I mean without question uh um but you know they also you know to when the Govern US government decided Huawei should pay for those sins in the past by cutting them off the the company had two choices either you go bankrupt or you innovate and that&#39;s that&#39;s created the number one competitive threat to Apple where they chose to innovate and they created this thing called the Huawei prom mate 60 plus which is arguably a better phone than an iPhone wow and um it it&#39;s not some cheap knockoff it costs it&#39;s expensive uh but it&#39;s arguably a better phone I mean just flat out it&#39;s a better phone and um that has become a real problem for Apple in terms of iPhone sales in China uh but additionally similar to what you&#39;re see to your points on Alibaba with lzada and um you know Huawei you know they&#39;re not going to be allowed to sell them here but you bet they&#39;re selling them in Latin America yeah um in the Middle East across Asia because it&#39;s just it&#39;s a great phone yeah yeah so it goes to show you don&#39;t mess with the free markets uh a couple other things I wanted to highlight here Cloud Cloud&#39;s adjusted EBA increased 155% uh and he said quote we&#39;re observing strong and sustained demand for AI products and solutions from our customers uh continues to strengthen Market leadership so Cloud had been a drag because they were unwinding the Tik Tock business which was the largest customer and then they were cutting out um Shifting the the business public and private trying to get out the unprofitable business can you speak at all about uh either laying fears or talking about public and private cloud and how Alibaba can maintain its its hegemony in the space I think they&#39;ve got 38 to 41% share at the moment yeah I think in general some of the Diplomatic falling out where you can argue the US and China kind of went through a covid divorce you know they Co babies and and there&#39;s some signs of uh that&#39;s improving Panda&#39;s diplomacy and uh uh just this week U uh pboc met with US Treasury officials and but anyway but but there was t\n\nHuawei prom mate 60 plus which is arguably a better phone than an iPhone wow and um it it&#39;s not some cheap knockoff it costs it&#39;s expensive uh but

EBA increased 155% uh and he said quote we&#39;re observing strong and sustained demand for AI products and solutions from our customers uh continues to strengthen Market leadership so Cloud had been a drag because they were unwinding the Tik Tock business which was the largest customer and then they were cutting out um Shifting the the business public and private trying to get out the unprofitable business can you speak at all about uh either laying fears or talking about public and private cloud and how Alibaba can maintain its its hegemony in the space I think they&#39;ve got 38 to 41% share at the moment yeah I think in general some of the Diplomatic falling out where you can argue the US and China kind of went through a covid divorce you know they Co babies and and there&#39;s some signs of uh that&#39;s improving Panda&#39;s diplomacy and uh uh just this week U uh pboc met with US Treasury officials and but anyway but but there was t\n\na consequence and unfortunately for us Cloud they're going to lose those China customers if it's AWS or Microsoft Oracle um and and that will stay inhouse now now in general there's been there there there's been encouragement from the government for state owned Enterprises and other other private companies in China to Leverage The technological capabilities of companies like Alibaba tensent and Badu who invested in you know kind of all the buzzwords AI Cloud big data that that they have a technological knowhow and and then if because of some of this diplomatic Fallout you're not going to be comfortable giving that to a US company you know no and vice versa then it's going to stay it's going to stay in China so so now the issue that Al you know what's interesting is people say oh well that's a pre- you you're pre-ordained Alibaba no no no like these companies in China compete with one another like nothing else and so I think you have this race to Garner market share that's weighed on some of the margins in Cloud um and and but that that will sort itself out right it'll find a balance if anything you're seeing some signs in in the electrical vehicle space or another where you there's no barriers to entry you've got giomi which makes cell phones creating an EV like how the you know but you know so so that competitiveness in China um I think you're seeing the government say wait whoa whoa you know you know solar capacity EV capacity and I think that will happen in in cloud and in and actually in technology where you'll say Hey listen you can't you can't let these py victories take place so so I think I think you know the market will find is still finding its way on terms of pricing But ultimately Alibaba is really really well positioned uh and will be one of the winners there yeah no question and uh you know another thing that people are going to have some worry about is the uh free cash flow okay so they generated 4.6 billion cash from operations 2.3 billion of free cash flow that that's down uh materially but they' they've identified two key reasons for that uh and maybe you want to speak to a little bit about that first was uh increase investments into Alibaba Cloud infrastructure so what they're saying is our demand is so strong that uh quote as soon as we get a server up a server is instantly running at full capacity that's the kind of demand so we can expect to see a very high Roi on over these uh next few quarters because we're building compute power to meet existing demand and that new compute power coming online is getting instantly taken up and running at full capacity on day one so they could either not invest and have five billion dollars of free cash flow or invest and and uh in in kind of the the Gold Rush days of AI cloud and gain share and keep their their hegemony which is what they've chosen to do but the other thing that impacted free cash flow because we emphasize that on on a our podcast a lot when we're doing turnarounds we do a lot of turnaround situations Baba is one it and the CFO said quote your second question is about free cash flow as I explained there's quite a big significant drop of free cash flow one of the reasons is the significant increase in expenditure AI Investments uh the other reason is because of sort of the working capital changes in relation to some of the business scale jobs what they did which also hurt the tbow t-all was they're reducing that um direct sales business I don't know if you're familiar with but that was down material they're proactively doing that because I guess it was low margin and he goes if you look at the business scale jobs many of them the majority are from those plan scale down as if you like as I was explaining why our direct sales business within tawau and t-ball dropped quite significantly the reason is we proactively scaled some of these onep business in T tbal and t-all we believe in some of these business categories onep format probably not a more efficient format so that sort of practice but if you uh but you will also have some of the business scale job was not proactively did that some of that overall Market situation the revenue dropped for example from SAA like in time all those businesses are one p and the job of their SC actually impacts working capital uh I don't know I can probably give you a bit more color on because one p on the other hand you're buying inventory from a vendor on the other hand you sell it and does the vendor normally give you a credit term like 60 days or 90 days if you can make your money your inventory turn over I.E sell inventory within a short period of time shorter than the short-term credit you're given actually you are generating cash flow particularly if the size is going up you're generating positive cash flow so on the contrary if you're reducing scale in this case on purpose uh it will have outflow on the working capital but is that a permanent impact he's he's asking a rhetorical question and he says to me I think that is relatively temporary impact so this process of reducing sale in that direct sales business uh we see this type of outfly outflow but when the business becomes stable we will no no longer see these types of outflows so for everyone worried about free cash flow and is the business deteriorating it's not it's one it's proactive decision on on uh investment and number two taking down this business this undesirable business the direct sales business for them is impacting working capital which is what is is impacting free cash flow and you can see that partially evidenced in cash from operations still being $4.6 billion and then buying back $5.8 billion uh of stock um so I I think that's kind of the the key highlights good to see the AI revenues up 200% uh it's good to get that explanation and then Eddie woo the CEO uh proclaimed that they're going to return to double digit Revenue growth in the second half of the fiscal year with gradual acceleration thereafter that's huge because no one is predicting that China GDP is going to go up to 8% or 9% so he's saying we're going to go from underperforming GDP in tbal and t-all to dramatically outperforming uh GDP as as the the monster player um and then the final thing I'd say two things that I liked about getting the cash under control first thing was this was a real pet PE mine so they bought $5.8 billion a stock but it was a net reduction of 2.3% of the share count uh because they've been doing a lot of employe stock options uh uh Employee Stock plan and which you said when meeting with these people people they were really motivated to get the stock price up because they all have a ton of stock what I'm glad about is that starting last last quarter they started to replace a portion of alibaba's uh ESOP incentives with long-term cash incentives for our employees starting last quarter these cash incentives will be reflected as cost and this is huge as an owner they going to be less shares less slices of the pie given out and they'll have that cash restricted over time cash is one time pay slice of the pie is a forever pay which as an owner I'm I'm less inclined and then\n\nso I I think that&#39;s kind of the the key highlights good to see the AI revenues up 200% uh it&#39;s good to get that explanation and then Eddie woo the CEO uh proclaimed that

FEATURED_COMPANY_DEEP_DIVES\nand then the final thing I&#39;d say two things that I liked about getting the cash under control first thing was this was a real pet PE mine so they bought $5.8 billion a stock but it was a net reduction of 2.3% of the share count uh because they&#39;ve been doing a lot of employe stock options uh uh Employee Stock plan and which you said when meeting with these people

less shares less slices of the pie given out and they&#39;ll have that cash restricted over time cash is one time pay slice of the pie is a forever pay which as an owner I&#39;m I&#39;m less inclined and then finally  they cut 6700 jobs which uh it&#39;s good to see them taking a little B bureaucracy out out of the business as well so Allin I mean this thing looks primed and poised to and when it turns it turns abruptly whether the Catalyst will be some policy from the Chinese government or this 20 billion to 30 billion of new buyers uh or the weakening dollar or the actual change in fed policy where we&#39;ve seen historically dollar goes down Yuan starts to appreciate bond yields Chinese bond yields start to go up a Yen starts to go up uh and and all of these things click all at once but but my experience and just looking at the the history is while they take a long time to turn and we you know two and a half years is a long time by historical standards kind of in line when they do turn it is so abrupt and material and uh maybe you could just speak to that and and any of the other points that I made on Alibaba as we wrap up oh no it&#39;s uh yeah you do an incredible service to your your subscribers and listeners just your death of analysis and um yeah yeah I mean in general I mean I think um you you&#39;ve had a little bit of an unwind in terms of China allocations I think Geographic there&#39;s a geographical that you know a lot of us investors went underweight or exited or were neutral because of the you know Trump with the trade War became the tech war and then zero covid uh some of the internet regulation and and a lot of European investors really got hurt um when Russia invaded the Ukraine because they were very overweight Russia and they said wow if you know if China were you know you Russia was overweight but it was small position if if China ever invaded Taiwan you know that that&#39;s a big position uh within Asia I think a lot of those investors were slower in coming out because obviously it&#39;s an important regionally economically but even going there so they they they were slower to come out and then actually I think investors in China were really the last to come out because they&#39;d say you know I&#39;m still using Alibaba or uh the world&#39;s not ending um and and so that that led to a real capitulation in in January of this year where the Chinese markets really rolled down because there was uh there were literally no buyers there&#39;s um and then there&#39;s other factors um you know actively managed funds have really suffered uh from the flows in the passive funds there&#39;s no dip buyers left yeah you know ETFs are kind of there&#39;s a momentum element You could argue um and so yeah we think the rewind will happen in Reverse which will the Chinese will be buy China yeah and and you&#39;re actually seeing that that in through this southbound stock connect Chinese investors have bought more stock and ETFs year to date than in all of 2023 wow you know just about $45 billion and so in Asia I think the view is well if that Yen starts appreciating that&#39;s a problem to being overweight Japan right that could that could actually and then India to to your point Tom yeah we do think it&#39;s um it&#39;s professional investors are going underway because of the valuations it&#39;s a very retail driven Market it&#39;s actually the largest derivative Market in Asia you know people talk about in the US everyone makes fun of this odte of in you know U but in in you know check it out in in India you know huge options derivative market and when you sort for the largest derivative P positions in in India you got to go way down until you hit the first put wow all calls wow that&#39;s that&#39;s part of what&#39;s you know this retail enthusiasm um because their economy is doing well and Modi um but but t",
    "MISCELLANEOUS": "\n\n but if you&#39;re primary listed outside of Hong Kong you you&#39;re not connect eligible okay and so Alibaba the shareholders will vote you know to make its dual primary which would make it um southbound connect eligible and I&#39;ve actually been I&#39;ve I&#39;ve made some phone calls um you know you know between us to Alibaba to the Hong Kong stock what is the exact date and and and I think people being very Koy on what is the exact date so I you know the the September 9th you know you know we&#39;ve talked about and and you know I&#39;ve seen some people kind of backtracking you know some people saying hey maybe that you know maybe it could be sooner you know maybe it&#39;ll be a little later so so but but but the key is it&#39;s coming and just to your point time you know you know how do we know what&#39;s coming well you know we did some comparisons you know you know 10 cent which um has about about a billion user just over a billion users of we chat uh it&#39;s you know China&#39;s Facebook and you know Alibaba the two main Ecommerce uh Tau and Teo have about 900 million users uh so you could say well what are the number of users or we could look at the number of shares or the percentage of market cap so about 10% % of 10 cents call it 400 billion in market cap is held so so you&#39;d say okay about 40 billion could go into Alibaba um but you could say well alibaba&#39;s you know only about 200 billion so 10% you know so so you know we don&#39;t we don&#39;t know exactly how much will come in it won&#39;t come in day one but you&#39;re talking about 20 to 40 billion yeah uh coming in I mean I mean this is a real number I mean this is a real real Catalyst and um you know you know I kind of D say like you know imagine not being own able to own Amazon yeah uh you know you use it every day and know you know you&#39;re you know I you know it&#39;s like you&#39;re gonna go Coco for Cocoa Puffs like you&#39;re GNA say I can buy the you know\n\n### MISCELLANEOUS\nfinally\n\n### MISCELLANEOUS\ncompanies you know the value energy financials Industrials materials real estate those are slower low growth sectors and yeah you you know that was kind of the point of John cr's Vision in creating crane shares is hey like give give people the ability to segment out these more growth companies but you got to go in and get them because you particularly you know when we started you know uh you know 11 years ago there was you know there was you know no no exposure in the broad Benchmark so um that's kind of the you know one of the key points about crane then and then providing people with the data you know that every day I wake up and I turn on the you know Financial TV or you know read the local finance and you know you'd think the world was ending in China and you know again you know when you go there it's it's very different and um you know streets are crowded the traffic's terrible restaurants are crowded you know yes there are issues without question but you know I think if if a chinese doctor cured cancer yeah the US headline would be China Fires at doctors right just it just there's there's just this constant uh negative narrative and you know maybe that's where you know the US government needs to justify its existence with a Boogeyman and the problem is US investors are highly exposed to China yeah um and even you know that's through US multinationals like you know the Teslas and apples and boeings and caterpillars and Starbucks that are doing great in China and you know this idea that we have this huge trade deficit with China is is not true if you take the profits if you take the profits of us multinationals for the stuff they manufacture in China and sell to the Chinese it's about 500 billion which is the amount of the trade you know the trade deficit is what's put on a boat but if you include the goods manufactured in China by us multin here is  no trade deficit but you never hear that in the Press so so that's a big part of you know an element of our research we want to provide is just saying hey there there's there's more more facets to that and then that dat is from the US from the New York Federal Reserve it's not from us now that that's really useful so um so if people want Diversified risk they can get kweb with that ticker kweb in their brokerage account um but what I want to talk about is uh just to to um last subject\n\n### MISCELLANEOUS\nhere is  no trade deficit but you never hear that in the Press so so that&#39;s a big part of you know an element of our research we want to provide is just saying hey there there&#39;s there&#39;s more more facets to that and then that dat is from the US from the New York Federal Reserve it&#39;s not from us now that that&#39;s really useful so um so if people want Diversified risk they can get kweb with that ticker kweb in their brokerage account um but what I want to talk about is uh just to to um last subject\n### FEATURED_COMPANY_DEEP_DIVES\nhere is  to go into alibaba&#39;s most recent earnings because what is going to be the driver because really honestly the F like if if China all the sudden wanted to get massive Equity inflows probably the number thing number one thing that they could do is buy Alibaba shares and drive the price up 50% because then all the indices would go up and then opinion follows Trend and all the pensions would be like you&#39;re under performing because you have no China exposure and it would just be like the oil thing in 2000 I&#39;m not saying they&#39;re going to do that like the Japan these did but they are in the market buying some equities leaving that aside let let&#39;s talk realistically about the the pluses and minuses because to some degree the health of China equities is dependent on Alibaba because that&#39;s what westerners know yes you have 10 cent speaking about outs we had the cloud we had the retail even fres shippo that thing could become the Costco of China I mean it&#39;s not there yet it&#39;s a couple billion dollar business but um um so so we talked about the the new buyers coming in they also announced something called they&#39;re going to copy 10 cent and Pino duo in doing the six uh 610 of 1% service software uh software service fee on all transactions I did a back of the napkin uh a math on that revenues last year for tbow and t-all were 57 billion so 60 bips on that is 342 million to the bottom line alone that starts in September which about 14 cents a share give or take it&#39;s not huge but but it increases the profitability increases the free cash flow now if they can buyb stocks through the southbound connect and not have to issue converts to buyback stocks that that could that could be a factor but you know revenues were anemic look GDP 5% they only did 4% revenues that&#39;s that&#39;s not great uh but Cloud business revenues\n\n### MISCELLANEOUS\ner invaded Taiwan you know that that&#39;s a big position uh within Asia I think a lot of those investors were slower in coming out because obviously it&#39;s an important regionally economically but even going there so they they they were slower to come out and then actually I think investors in China were really the last to come out because they&#39;d say you know I&#39;m still using Alibaba or uh the world&#39;s not ending um and and so that that led to a real capitulation in in January of this year where the Chinese markets really rolled down because there was uh there were literally no buyers there&#39;s um and then there&#39;s other factors um you know actively managed funds have really suffered uh from the flows in the passive funds there&#39;s no dip buyers left yeah you know ETFs are kind of there&#39;s a momentum element You could argue um and so yeah we think the rewind will happen in Reverse which will the Chinese will be buy China yeah and and you&#39;re actually seeing that that in through this southbound stock connect Chinese investors have bought more stock and ETFs year to date than in all of 2023 wow you know just about $45 billion and so in Asia I think the view is well if that Yen starts appreciating that&#39;s a problem to being overweight Japan right that could that could actually and then India to to your point Tom yeah we do think it&#39;s um it&#39;s professional investors are going underway because of the valuations it&#39;s a very retail driven Market it&#39;s actually the largest derivative Market in Asia you know people talk about in the US everyone makes fun of this odte of in you know U but in in you know check it out in in India you know huge options derivative market and when you sort for the largest derivative P positions in in India you got to go way down until you hit the first put wow all calls wow that&#39;s that&#39;s part of what&#39;s you know this retail enthusiasm um because their economy is doing well and Modi um but but there is  this odte effect I mean they don&#39;t have odte options but but you know so anyway so so a lot of professional investors are saying hey maybe I should be a little nervous about about India and and so I think I think over time um I think a lot of as well as the other big overweight in Asia is US equities I mean it just um I I just I really do but think a lot of this money is uh retail money out of Asia and uh the dollar the dollar declines that&#39;s going to weigh on you know if you&#39;re levered up you know it doesn&#39;t take much until you get really hurt you know as we saw with the Yen carry trade um but I think I think you know you know either elements of that start flowing back Ian that&#39;s that&#39;s been my counsil to people is like hey like I&#39;m not you know you know you know I&#39;d be charging 2 and 20 if I could predict the future right why why would you not take a piece of US tech profit and put in cheap China yeah you know Che China attack like what like just take a little smidge like why would you not you know you know particularly you know with the um election you know what are you know based on who wins what happens with long-term cap gains like uh there&#39;s all these different scenarios like why would you just take a piece you know tell high and Buy Low like why why would you not do that yeah for a piece right um I I think I think there&#39;s an argument we&#39;re starting to see that yeah yeah and it&#39;s um you know it&#39;s the old saying good things happen when you buy high quality assets at low prices I mean it&#39;s just a matter of of it&#39;s not a it&#39;s never a question of if it&#39;s a me it&#39;s a question of when and uh and the same will be true I I love that you brought up that energy analogy in 2020 because it was that same level of pessimism that pensions will never again invest in until the price goes up and everyone chases it and uh and I could certainly see I mean you know mag 7 their earnings growth decelerating from 50% to 20% doesn&#39;t mean they&#39;re going to crash like the Tech rec they&#39;re just going to I think perform less well than they have in the rearview mirror there&#39;ll be a lot of money made under the surface but you can make tons of doubles and triples under the surface uh and the indices don&#39;t don&#39;t do much uh and that would imply that the mag 7 you know maybe they get back up to highs and they just grind for a year you know and and uh and as the dollar weakens we start to to see this diversification so I&#39;m very excited one of the things I like to look at every day when I wake up is your writing on China last night.com so maybe if you could tell people how to follow you where you are on Twitter tell them a little bit about your daily China note uh and and uh and and lastly your ETF and then we&#39;ll wrap up yeah no than and any final thoughts also yeah yeah yeah yeah I mean um you know our such a key thesis at cran shers is providing a DAT data driven perspective on what&#39;s happening in China&#39;s economy and capital markets and uh you know in order to do so I I write you know I&#39;ve been doing it for I think like seven years um China last night.com which is just a brief concise overview of what happened last night in China what&#39;s important and I used it as an element to maybe negate you know some of the popular Western\n\nI mean you know mag 7 their earnings growth decelerating from 50% to 20% doesn't mean they're going to crash like the Tech rec they're just going to I think perform less well than they have in the rearview mirror there'll be a lot of money made under the surface but you can make tons of doubles and triples under the surface uh and the indices don't don't do much. I think great companies in China including Alibaba they're they're putting you know their you know really their wallet where their mouth is and you know if these Tech entrepreneurs are buying back stock that probably means China's economy is not to do a thelman and Louise and go off a cliff yeah that their own company's Prospect like Alibaba is not about to go off a cliff that they see something and they're doing something about it and the question is like what are we as inv investors doing when we see that and I'd say like listen this stuff is volatile I mean um you know it's it's part of a well- diversified portfolio you know these stocks these ETFs two to three times more volatile than the S&P 500 so you just got to volatility adjust your position but yeah we're we're constructive we see an opportunity I mean we're that's self-serving and highly biased I mean that's the asterisk you know well very heavily invested personally and it's been it's been it's been it's been a brutal you know really three and a half years um but you know I think these things do pass for sure yeah well I think we've we've rung out a lot of the downside volatility and it'll be fun to to experience the upside volatility uh when it\n\n### MISCELLANEOUS\nMarket leadership regime changes a super tanker and it doesn't happen overnight. I think there's a huge home bias to US equities but I think it is a global bias to US equities and I would argue that there's some real arguments that's changing and I think great companies in China including Alibaba they're putting their wallet where their mouth is. If these Tech entrepreneurs are buying back stock that probably means China's economy is not about to go off a cliff that they see something and they're doing something about it and the question is like what are we as investors doing when we see that and I'd say like listen this stuff is volatile. These stocks these ETFs two to three times more volatile than the S&P 500 so you just got to volatility adjust your position but yeah we're constructive we see an opportunity. David Tepper just wrote a billion dollar check to buy some Alibaba in the last quarter. What I love about that is what I wish we saw more with American companies when American company stock craters management don't buy in stock the way that they do in China and I love the fact that the Chinese have the right mindset that when the price goes down and you believe in your prospects that's when you load the boat and you buy all the stock you don't crawl under the desk and I think that's going to serve us as owners very very well that they were reducing the float and in Baba's case now even doing it more aggressively and saying you guys have enough pieces of the pie we're going to give you cash bonuses and we're going to let the owners take the ride with us so get in get on before we take off and at year end I think Joe Sai and Jack Ma who's retired from the took big purchase. Just a very solid sign all in all together and they're turning the boat well.\n\n### MISCELLANEOUS\none of the guys that uh I admire quite a bit obviously I&#39;m a Buffett Acolyte and Munger and all those guys but another one that&#39;s more along the lines of my style is David terer and uh he just wrote a billion dollar check to buy some Alibaba uh in the last quarter uh last couple of quarters so um you know another value guy another value guy but a guy with uh you know some dramatic outperformance over decades you know 30% kager over many decades a legend uh and what I love about uh that you know what I what I wish we saw more with American companies when American company stock craters management don&#39;t buy in stock the way that they do in China and and I love the fact that the Chinese have the right mindset that when the price goes down and you believe in your prospects that&#39;s when you load the boat and you buy all the stock you don&#39;t crawl under the desk um and and I think that&#39;s going to serve us as owners very very well that they were reducing the float and in Baba&#39;s case now even doing it more aggressively and saying you guys have enough pieces of the pie we&#39;re going to give you cash bonuses and we&#39;re going to let the owners take the ride with us so get in get on before we take off yeah and you know at year end uh I think Joe Sai and jackm who&#39;s retired from the you know did took big you know made a big big purchase uh I you know I forget what the exact numbers but uh yeah just just a very solid sign all all in you know all together yeah yeah and they&#39;re turning the boat well\n\n### MACRO_DATA_SLIDES\nhere is the S&amp;P forward returns 13 26 39 and 52 weeks after the Vick spikes above 45 which it did a few weeks ago and you see on average a year out it&#39;s up 14% every period whether it&#39;s 4 we 8 week on average it&#39;s up and that&#39;s what we&#39;re seeing next returns were positive when the First Rate cut did not prede a recession and you can see six months later so even if the market goes down a little bit after the first cut what they&#39;re trying to say\n### MISCELLANEOUS\nhere is uh 3 months and 6 months later on average it&#39;s up pretty materially over time and if there&#39;s no recession which at 2% GDP growth it&#39;s going to be tough to get two quarters of negative GDP unless they do something stupid and they don&#39;t cut then like you&#39;re going to have deflation uh and a huge problem but um leaving that aside dividend yield is where the action is at inexpensive versus history the cheapest it&#39;s been since 2002 I reemphasize these things because they&#39;re important and if you get the themes you can make a lot of money again",

    "QUOTES_OF_THE_WEEK": "\n\n### QUOTES_OF_THE_WEEK\nWarren Buffett look at Market fluctuations as your friend rather than your enemy profit from Folly rather than participate in it and the second one is I will tell you how to become rich close the doors be fearful when others are greedy be greedy when others are fearful\n### HEADLINES_AND_NEWS\nBuyBacks through the roof you can see it here uh we went oh this is interesting from Goldman Sachs I referenced fast lane and the checkout system that increases conversion from 50% to 80% while just a couple of days after PayPal announced a partnership with Aiden which is a huge payments processor in Europe to offer fast lane and here&#39;s what Goldman Sachs had to say about it uh aen offering fast lane to its Enterprise Merchant and and Marketplace customers fast lane allows first-time users to save their C card and shipping information then automatically pre-fills these fields at Merchants using fast lane for all future purchases this improves guest checkout conversion rate to 80 plus% and reduces time to check out by 32% uh we view the announcement as a positive development for PayPal as distribution for Fast Lane expands expands particularly if offered via aen addan which has strong Global Enterprise relationships in particular we believe the distribution of Fast Lane through similar to branded checkout and other payment methods shows increased ability to compete versus other methods of online checkout we also see this as consistent with Management&#39;s commentary around the potential to unbundle fast lane from branded and unbranded checkout which we believe helps PayPal to compete on a more similar playing field to Apple pay and Google pay uh we see this as a positive for PayPal&#39;s distribution and continued sign of the strong execution at the company since the current management team took the the helm IE Alex Chris who came from into it who ran 50% of the business while over 10 years that stock was a 38 bagger so um we&#39;re excited about that we covered uh Charles this is critically important you will understand the significance of the chart below after you listen to my conversation with Charles Payne and and which you just did and read the article from last week here&#39;s the link to the article from last week this by the way not only goes into our updates last week but it has links back to our original thesis uh when we got involved in the company in May of 2022 at $510 um so per share you will understand as it relates to vehicle incentives one of our loyal podcast video cast viewers hat tip to Stephen Frampton sent us this updated updated chart from Cox Automotive uh and then I&#39;ve made these annotations on it and here&#39;s what we&#39;ve been saying people have been worried oh my gosh dealer inventories are growing they&#39;re increasing incentives increasing incentives are the name of the game when you want volume we are not in the business of Ford and GM making as much money per car as possible we are in the business of Ford and GM making as many cars as possible that is the critical name of the game and so right now vehicle incentives are at 7% of total purchase price in 2017 they got up to 11% of total purchase price and average incentives in July Rose to 7% uh or 33 3,383 per car up from 6.4% in June and the most generous level seen in 2024 incentives are now Higher by 59.1% compared to one year ago when the average incentive package was 4.4% of of uh total purchase price in July of 2023 new vehicle incentives in July were at their highest point in more than three years this is huge this is going to show us big volumes because like I said the cartel that GM and Ford and Stanis had during covid when they could control Supply and charge as much as humanly possible per car um uh is is over okay and now you know the Koreans are putting in cheaper cars and they&#39;re going to have to buy make smaller cars massive cars massive volume and CPS gets paid per car and it&#39;s it&#39;s pretty much the same amount of cars parts per car uh except for the fact if you go to hybrids it dramatically increases the cost per vehicle for Cooper standard in other words Hy hybrids are even better than uh internal combustion and EVS as well which are slowing demand but the big where they make all the biggest amount of money is the hybrids uh I are good uh EVS are good but I think demand is waning for EVS all right Alibaba update so we covered with Brendan the this 20 billion coming in they had a shareholder vote today I&#39;m sure there&#39;ll be an announcement tomorrow I&#39;m sure that went through in which case the southbound link opens which could be as early as September 9th uh we were talking about $20 billion of flows uh Brendan referenced maybe 30 or 40 billion of inflows which would be 20% of the float which would be absolutely unbelievable but I think that&#39;s true like if you&#39;ve got you know if you weren&#39;t allowed to own Amazon for all these years and you have three boxes a day coming to your door and you&#39;re you know buying books and audibles and watching their videos and a Prime member subscriber and all of a sudden you have the chance to participate in that and buy it you&#39;re going to buy it hand over fist and I think the Chinese you know it&#39;s the national champion I think it&#39;s going to be uh um you know over subscribed so to speak in terms of demand so that&#39;s that they went through the historic stuff here next plan the vote is today and stock connect on September 9th you can see in the Bloomberg article also we covered with Brendan the uh 60 basis points on um t-all and tawau transactions which is in line with their competitors JD and Pino Doo has been doing it for a while they&#39;re now going to get that that&#39;s 343 million to the bottom line and more that&#39;s on last year sales so prospectively it starts in September that&#39;s straight to the bottom line and then even the cell side got excited after earnings uh Bank of America came out um talking about um profit let&#39;s see reiterate Buy on improving growth Outlook uh solid in investor return execution profit beats consensus as enhanced cost disciplines across the business uh and then they go through the growth and the expectations Etc so the key highlights here we covered quite a few of them total revenues are up four 4% Cloud business grew 6% uh Cloud adjusted e up 135% AI revenues grew triple digit year onye paying users of Alibaba AI uh stuff 200% quarteron quarter uh International grew 32% K now grew 16% they re purchased 5.8 billion a stock reduced the float by 2.3% that&#39;s going to get better and better because now they&#39;re shifting from all stock option uh all stock incentives to now cash which I&#39;ve been pounding the table on for a year why are they giving away so much stock so now they&#39;re going to do cash I love cash bonuses restricted over time because cash is a one-time payment a slice of the pie is a forever payment I&#39;d rather give them a one-time payment versus a forever payment they&#39;ve got enough stock they have the same incentives we have as co-owners they cut 6,700 jobs so they&#39;re sewing discipline uh and for the free cash flow which we&#39;re going to spend reiterate we covered with Brendan uh people were worried about that they still did 4.6 billion from operations they did 2.3 billion of free cash flow that was attributable to two things just to reemphasize I&#39;m not going to read the quote again but uh working capital as it related to taking down proactively taking down the wholesale I&#39;m sorry the direct sales business at tbow t-all um and um and by the way that noise in the background they&#39;re cutting a bunch of trees on the property so uh just we&#39;ll just deal with it um so that was one and number two uh investment in AI Cloud because they can&#39;t keep up with demand so they got to build new servers new data centers because the compute demand is literally unlimited and they&#39;re the number one player so it all they have to do is suck in all these people now at low margins and then once they&#39;ve dominated everything then they can raise price once everyone&#39;s stuck on their stuff the switching costs are higher than you think it&#39;s a pain in the ass if you&#39;re a CTO you don&#39;t want to switch if you don&#39;t have to so you let you know inertia is the name of the game um internal and external ecommer market share ah this is key so internal and external data about e-commerce players market share Dynamics indicates a positive trend in gradual market share stabilization so they they lost they they stopped losing share and they&#39;re actually starting to regain share is what they said in the Q&amp;A section um also their CMR growth uh the the GM gross merchandise volume growth grew High grew double digits the CMR gr growth the margin on that didn&#39;t grow as fast because obviously they&#39;re they&#39;re now boxing out teu and uh pindu Duo bigger they&#39;re better they&#39;re going to kick them in the teeth the economy is going to recover and then the higher end stuff where which they own uh is going to dominate but in the meantime they&#39;re like we&#39;re going to even kick them where where we don&#39;t play and we&#39;re going to go after them in the low-end lowquality stuff and we&#39;re going to do that for a while which they did and that impacted their CMR but they expect that to catch up to G gross merchandise value very very quickly cuz they had to move fast which they did and now they&#39;re caught up and the margins are going to go back so we&#39;re confident that alibaba&#39;s overall Revenue excluding Alibaba Consolidated subsidiaries will return to double digit growth in the second half of the fiscal year with gradual acceleration thereafter they still have 26.1 billion remaining on the share repurchase availability and as we&#39; covered with Brendan he believes what we believe that they will no they will no longer be limited in their ability to do BuyBacks because they can&#39;t get us uh they they can&#39;t get their cash outside of China uh now they&#39;ll be able to buy on the southbound connect and so they won&#39;t have to issue these convertible preper preferreds and then buy them back to be anti-dilutive so they can get cash out of the country uh out of the country cash they can now just buy stock on the southbound stock connect uh once that goes through and that&#39;s going to enable them to do unlimited BuyBacks to the extent that they want is limited to the extent that they can access cash even though they have unlimited amounts of cash in China they had trouble with the amount of cash they had outside of China that&#39;s no longer going to be an issue uh quote we&#39;ve started to replace a portion of alibaba&#39;s ESOP incentives with long-term cash incentives for our employees start starting last quarter these cash incentives will be reflected as costs while it will change compens lower adjusted eida it will also result in less ESOP delution in the future that is huge ladies and gentlemen uh uh also as far as Alibaba Cloud we are confident that revenue from external customers will return to double digit growth in the second half of the fiscal year with gradual acceleration thereafter this is becoming a growth company again ladies and gentlemen and it&#39;s priced like a cigar butt and that&#39;s going to change and when it changes and rates it&#39;s going to be very very quick expecting double digit Revenue in Cloud accelerate moving forward uh the other thing is the analysts are like aren&#39;t you seeing a Slowdown cool qu what we see certainly among our own cloud customers is that their AI budgets for this year are higher significantly higher than they were last year any Enterprise that is digitized and relies on digitization must be investing it has to be investing in AI all the industry is now uh that are using AI are leveraging it to enhance their competitiveness and efficiency so any Enterprise that&#39;s in any way digitally Reliant will certainly not scale down its investment in AI because to do so would impair their own competitiveness and efficiency so that&#39;s a clear Trend we&#39;re seeing and we are not seeing any kind of slowdown or softening this was a key reason we got involved with Alibaba to start with is their Cloud hegemony why the CFO sees free cash flow decline as temporary which we covered so he&#39;s basically saying um Let me let me explain this I I I it Bears such important repeating as it relates to free cash flow okay because for doing one p business on the one hand you are buying inventory from the vendor on the other hand you sell it and does the vendor normally give you a credit term like 60 days or 90 days if you can make the inventory turnover I.E sell inventory within a short period of time shorter than the short sort of credit term you&#39;re given actually you are generating cash flow particularly if the size is going up you&#39;re generating positive cash flow on the contrary if you&#39;re reducing scale like they are with the direct sales business on purpose uh you will have outflow on working capital but is that is that a temporary impact to me I think this is relatively uh he says is this is this a permanent impact to me I think this is a relatively temporary impact during the process of reducing scale we will see this outflow but when the business size become stable we will no longer see these types of outflow okay so why are they doing the capex that was the second thing that imp impacted uh free cash flow and it&#39;s simply because quote we see a lot of demand a lot of unmet demand from many clients this is related to AI capex uh and you look at the pipeline those clients have you know there&#39;s going to be ongoing demand so whether it&#39;s training inference or API calls what we see we&#39;re making these kind of capex Investments quote as soon as we get a server up a server is instantly running at full capacity there&#39;s that kind of demand so we can expect to see a very high Roi over these next quarters because we&#39;re building compute power to meet existing demand and that new compute power coming online is getting instantly taken up and running at full capacity on day one huge ladies and gentlemen um so high single digit gmv growth double digit order growth uh this quarter some other other C we we covered most of them I just want to get some of these Stars here you can read this on your own the 88 VIP members that&#39;s like a paid subscription like Prime uh increase double digits year-over-year surpassing 42 million during the quarter pretty serious no one ever talks about it uh number of paying users using alibaba&#39;s Cloud AI platform has increased by over 200% quarter on quoter it&#39;s unbelievable um okay uh driven by double digit uh okay uh Cloud grew 6% driven by double digit public Cloud growth increasing adoption of AI related products AI related product Revenue continued to grow at triple digits year-over-year we continue to invest in customers and Technology particular AI infrastructure to increase Cloud adoption and for a the AI to maintain our our market share leadership uh significant double digit Revenue okay so we covered that uh aidc that&#39;s the international grew 32% year-over-year K now the log ICS 16% year-over-year local Services Group 12% year-over-year even the digital media grew 4% year-over-year all right let&#39;s see here some of these key stars and then we can move on we&#39;ve got still a lot to cover this week uh I was going to release Brendan&#39;s interview separately but then I just thought it would be confusing so we put it all in here uh notable okay Alibaba cloud has gained notable recognition as the cloud service provider of choice for AI uh according to recently released Gartner which is the industry standard uh Magic for data science and machine learning platforms report Alibaba cloud has been mentioned as the only Asia based cloud service provider among Global players uh code gener while enhancing s 27 language number paying users on Alibaba Cloud AI platform increased over 200% covered all this covered this covered that okay uh our focus on enhancing user experience by offering quality products at attractive prices with great service led to stabilizing market share of tbal and t-all group as we return the business to the growth trajectory the cloud business achieve positive Revenue momentum driven by public cloud and AI related products maintain our we continue to invest to maintain our Market leadership we invest for growth in our Core Business while reducing losses in other business to operating efficiency which they did a good job that&#39;s why the sell side was so happy uh 5.8 billion of shares late uh repurchases underscores our confidence in business Outlook all right um okay next increase covered that I just don&#39;t want to miss anything because there&#39;s so many important points in what happened talked about the reversals look at these business units Top Line every single one China Commerce up 1% the direct sales they&#39;re winding down on purpose as we discussed the uh wholesale up 16% the overall if they weren&#39;t proactively turning that down I think it was like high mid single digit growth uh Cloud intelligence up 6% you know and then you just go line by line every single unit is up every single unit is up that&#39;s what we call a turnaround ladies and gentlemen that&#39;s why turnarounds are so critical what you need is Cash on the balance sheet and uh or options to pay down debt they don&#39;t have any of those problems and they&#39;re actually reaccelerating so they&#39;re like late stage turnaround now they&#39;re into growth re acceleration can go through all those just trying to make sure that I didn&#39;t miss any key things I wanted to cover here covered a lot of them with Brendan still have 84 billion dollars worth of cash by the way net cash whatever it is 65 billion I think they got 20 billion of debt uh they called the employees which we covered for another stabilization uh triple digit growth we covered that through intensive R&amp;D investment we aim to sustain profitable growth while establishing ourselves as a leading Cloud as a leading cloud provider for AI with healthy profitability and market share leadership uh profit 32% year on year okay so in conclusion our strategic focus is twofold enhancing operational efficiency across all business segments while on the other hand actively investing in the key markets to drive quality growth in scale with the goal of achieving more substantial profitability at scale in the future um winning the Mind share of our consumers purchased 630 million ordinary Shares are 77 million ads for a total of 5.8 billion 2.3% net reduction we talked about the long-term cash incentives this is a big deal increasing investment led to better consumer retention increased the purchase frequency and positive feedback regarding overall shopping experience uh consolid okay Cloud We Believe strengthen our Market leadership 4% okay increasing this investment okay yeah Solutions all right so you can go through this line by line stream okay now as the market share stabilizes what we certainly see in this quarter we can start to accelerate the pace of our monetization efforts that&#39;s what that CMR was the margins the volumes are growing like crazy the margins now are going to re accelerate they can start to do monetization now that they&#39;ve stabilized the ship uh there are a few factors you&#39;ll have to look at first the various new products we&#39;ve launched including live streaming uh including the uh R&amp;B 10 billion subsidy program which resulted in higher user return and high and return to platforms and high user repurchase rates but it&#39;s going to take a bit of time to roll out the new monetization approaches and products for them to gain traction new advertising product we&#39;re introducing uh the first me okay so first they got the traffic second a sufficient number of advertising takeen apart covered that they talk about the 60 basis points on all transactions starting in September that&#39;s huge uh hundreds of millions to the bottom line go looking long run AI okay so they&#39;re aiming to get the approval from shareholders and get it completed before the end of August which means it uh the Chinese could be able to start to buy Alibaba stock as soon as early September um so half of their Cloud growth is going to be driven by AI products uh versus the CPU U stuff uh anyting certainly got that so there&#39;s just so much good detail in here secondly the software service Fe will take ah software service fee will also help on the take rate few other short measures as well so these are the things we&#39;ve currently been why we started to do it because we see growth back on the gmv and we see the sign of stabilizing market share so they could only charge this if they had confidence that they&#39;ve started to regain share and they&#39;re back on a growth trajectory you know you don&#39;t raise prices on Merchants uh if you think you&#39;re the sick the the ship is sinking you only do that when you&#39;re back to growth and that&#39;s that&#39;s where they are okay uh I think the reason clearly a very strong backlog continue investing simply because we see a lot of demand okay we expect to continue to be investing in AI capex at the same Pace simply because we see a lot of demand a lot of unmet demand from many clients and you look at the pipeline those clients have you know there&#39;s going to be ongoing demand\n### TECHNICAL_CHARTS\nand you can see these different um indicators interestingly enough the worldwide box office year-to date ladies and gentlemen what are the top top two films they&#39;re Disney inside out to Deadpool and Wolverine uh was actually the largest R-rated movie box office in the history of box offices so the idea that no one&#39;s going to the movie theaters is apparently inaccurate Microsoft has accelerated heavy investments in AI reason I put this chart is so you can see the magnitude and you can see why that shift from magnificent 7 to 493 is happening and is going to continue to happen uh not because they&#39;re going to crash or anything but because their margins are going to be crimped from all their investment and their earnings growth is decelerating from 50% to 20% doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s going out of business it just means that the relative value is going to be outside those groups in terms of outperformance and we covered some of that Bond Bond and Equity Universe um this is really interesting the value of all Global bonds and stocks is 255 trillion the value of all Global bonds is 130 trillion the value all Global stocks is 125 trillion so when you have a company like you know apple or Nvidia get up to these four and five trillion dollar valuations you know when you back it out and you just measure it relative to GDP and measure it relative to uh the global value of every stock on Earth you can start to see how some of these have gotten a little bit ahead of their skis and if you zoom out as we always say you can discern and take advantage of those um opportunities to stay away so or or uh trim you know as you know we&#39;ve done uh well before any of this uh Yen dislocation and all that stuff was happening Financial assets are worth 233% of global GDP they peaked in 2019 at 270 billion wor 270% of global GDP the value of Wall Street relative to the value of Main Street is almost back at record highs um negative yielding debt has dropped from 18 trillion to zero in the last four years so there was a lot of negative yielding debt if you think of jgbs uh even um real yields on treasuries were negative and now that&#39;s back to more normalized levels uh top five stocks in the S&amp;P 500 peaked at 29% of the market in July of 2024 we said it was bananas that has now rolled over magnificent 7 reached market cap reached a record high of $17 trillion in July 2024 when we were getting out of uh Amazon getting out of Google that we bought in October 2022 when no one wanted it and you can see that that rolling over um 17 trillion again you say wow $17 trillion well they&#39;re great companies okay are they worth one fifth of the entire world of global equities like there are 10,000 Global equities let&#39;s just say there&#39;s probably more call it 12,000 uh Global equities these are you know five stocks should be 20% of all the value of all of the markets in the world it&#39;s a little extreme and these extremes always get corrected as you see over and over and over so they get corrected in part by the others growing and in part by them either staying static or coming in a little bit to more normalized valuations uh Tech Telecom Healthcare peaked at 45% of global equities in July 2024 we haven&#39;t seen that level since uh 22000 okay so that that&#39;s where you want to be where you want to avoid uh you got to pay attention to stuff like that uh this is the cross asset returns from 2010 to 2024 and the thing the reason I&#39;d like to show this uh and boy you guys are getting a lot of value per dollar this week I hope you&#39;re drinking coffee to catch keep up with me here um it the reason I show these is because what you can see is the last shall be first is a very consistent theme just look at gold gold was on top in 2010 by 2013 it was at the bottom by 2016 it was back on top by 2020 it was way on top then it collapsed into 2021 now it&#39;s reisen everyone wants gold it&#39;s going to be back on the bottom in the next few years no it can&#39;t be on the bottom central banks are buying it central banks have been the biggest Contra indicator since the biggest since the beginning of time so if you just do the opposite so they&#39;ll they&#39;ll they&#39;ll buy more and then it&#39;ll change same same if you look at these cross asset returns uh from in the 2000s you couldn&#39;t give away emerging markets in 2000 by 2003 it was the top performing asset did 56% that that year the next year it did 26% the next year it did 34% this is exactly where we are ladies and gentlemen we are going to be um finding ourselves in a position where they start to outperform two years ago they two years ago they did1 19 -2 last two years they&#39;re up double digits they&#39;re just getting started that&#39;s what you saw in 200 2001 and 2002 they came out of the doldrums and then they made it to the top which is probably next year um but just look at these patterns that&#39;s the one thing that I&#39;m very good at is pattern recognition and um um you look at every single decade here was another decade everyone says like oh you know us exceptionalism I agree us exceptionalism that doesn&#39;t mean that International stocks should underperform forever and the answer is they didn&#39;t they outperformed in the80s believe it or not remember they were down on the vulker era then by 83 21% 12% 25% 10% 22% 40% 65% I mean it was the best performing asset in the 80s then the 90 it took the break because the uh Tech took over and then in the 2000s it had its biggest run ever from 2001 to 2007 so what have we had we&#39;ve had the same thing we had it run in 2020 take a break due to the tech Mania from uh the last 10 years and now it&#39;ll be back this 10 years you watch what happens it&#39;s history doesn&#39;t rhyme but it does repeat look at the 70s what Emerging Markets did top of the Shelf every single year I mean 14% 36% 30% in 1973 13.5% when the US market collapsed 26% it was down 15 then it was back up back up back up top of the chart these will be back ladies and gentlemen um all right so you get the point crowded trades uh you can look here too where the dividend yields are by sector uh energy is a big dividend yield as rates cut people are going to want dividends financials reats utilities have already run up ahead of it uh price to earnings where are the lowest price to earnings ratios energy uh financials re utilities trailing price to earnings Price to Book ratios Etc so burden yourself with data that&#39;s all I can suggest uh it works the bull bear indicator is not yet at the extreme bullishness level where you want to sell that&#39;s from Bank of America restaurant spending is falling a little bit you&#39;re seeing that in the lowest end of the consumer uh retail sales though is still strong because in aggregate um people are spending I I think it was like the top 20% does 50% I I don&#39;t know there&#39;s so so much data but yes there are Crosswinds the FED does need to cut it&#39;s not all roses and green shoots uh but if they act quickly enough like they did in 95 all will be well on that front\n",
    "HEADLINES_AND_NEWS": "\n\n### QUOTES_OF_THE_WEEK\nWarren Buffett look at Market fluctuations as your friend rather than your enemy profit from Folly rather than participate in it and the second one is I will tell you how to become rich close the doors be fearful when others are greedy be greedy when others are fearful\n### HEADLINES_AND_NEWS\nBuyBacks through the roof you can see it here uh we went oh this is interesting from Goldman Sachs I referenced fast lane and the checkout system that increases conversion from 50% to 80% while just a couple of days after PayPal announced a partnership with Aiden which is a huge payments processor in Europe to offer fast lane and here&#39;s what Goldman Sachs had to say about it uh aen offering fast lane to its Enterprise Merchant and and Marketplace customers fast lane allows first-time users to save their C card and shipping information then automatically pre-fills these fields at Merchants using fast lane for all future purchases this improves guest checkout conversion rate to 80 plus% and reduces time to check out by 32% uh we view the announcement as a positive development for PayPal as distribution for Fast Lane expands expands particularly if offered via aen addan which has strong Global Enterprise relationships in particular we believe the distribution of Fast Lane through similar to branded checkout and other payment methods shows increased ability to compete versus other methods of online checkout we also see this as consistent with Management&#39;s commentary around the potential to unbundle fast lane from branded and unbranded checkout which we believe helps PayPal to compete on a more similar playing field to Apple pay and Google pay uh we see this as a positive for PayPal&#39;s distribution and continued sign of the strong execution at the company since the current management team took the the helm IE Alex Chris who came from into it who ran 50% of the business while over 10 years that stock was a 38 bagger so um we&#39;re excited about that we covered uh Charles this is critically important you will understand the significance of the chart below after you listen to my conversation with Charles Payne and and which you just did and read the article from last week here&#39;s the link to the article from last week this by the way not only goes into our updates last week but it has links back to our original thesis uh when we got involved in the company in May of 2022 at $510 um so per share you will understand as it relates to vehicle incentives one of our loyal podcast video cast viewers hat tip to Stephen Frampton sent us this updated updated chart from Cox Automotive uh and then I&#39;ve made these annotations on it and here&#39;s what we&#39;ve been saying people have been worried oh my gosh dealer inventories are growing they&#39;re increasing incentives increasing incentives are the name of the game when you want volume we are not in the business of Ford and GM making as much money per car as possible we are in the business of Ford and GM making as many cars as possible that is the critical name of the game and so right now vehicle incentives are at 7% of total purchase price in 2017 they got up to 11% of total purchase price and average incentives in July Rose to 7% uh or 33 3,383 per car up from 6.4% in June and the most generous level seen in 2024 incentives are now Higher by 59.1% compared to one year ago when the average incentive package was 4.4% of of uh total purchase price in July of 2023 new vehicle incentives in July were at their highest point in more than three years this is huge this is going to show us big volumes because like I said the cartel that GM and Ford and Stanis had during covid when they could control Supply and charge as much as humanly possible per car um uh is is over okay and now you know the Koreans are putting in cheaper cars and they&#39;re going to have to buy make smaller cars massive cars massive volume and CPS gets paid per car and it&#39;s it&#39;s pretty much the same amount of cars parts per car uh except for the fact if you go to hybrids it dramatically increases the cost per vehicle for Cooper standard in other words Hy hybrids are even better than uh internal combustion and EVS as well which are slowing demand but the big where they make all the biggest amount of money is the hybrids uh I are good uh EVS are good but I think demand is waning for EVS all right Alibaba update so we covered with Brendan the this 20 billion coming in they had a shareholder vote today I&#39;m sure there&#39;ll be an announcement tomorrow I&#39;m sure that went through in which case the southbound link opens which could be as early as September 9th uh we were talking about $20 billion of flows uh Brendan referenced maybe 30 or 40 billion of inflows which would be 20% of the float which would be absolutely unbelievable but I think that&#39;s true like if you&#39;ve got you know if you weren&#39;t allowed to own Amazon for all these years and you have three boxes a day coming to your door and you&#39;re you know buying books and audibles and watching their videos and a Prime member subscriber and all of a sudden you have the chance to participate in that and buy it you&#39;re going to buy it hand over fist and I think the Chinese you know it&#39;s the national champion I think it&#39;s going to be uh um you know over subscribed so to speak in terms of demand so that&#39;s that they went through the historic stuff here next plan the vote is today and stock connect on September 9th you can see in the Bloomberg article also we covered with Brendan the uh 60 basis points on um t-all and tawau transactions which is in line with their competitors JD and Pino Doo has been doing it for a while they&#39;re now going to get that that&#39;s 343 million to the bottom line and more that&#39;s on last year sales so prospectively it starts in September that&#39;s straight to the bottom line and then even the cell side got excited after earnings uh Bank of America came out um talking about um profit let&#39;s see reiterate Buy on improving growth Outlook uh solid in investor return execution profit beats consensus as enhanced cost disciplines across the business uh and then they go through the growth and the expectations Etc so the key highlights here we covered quite a few of them total revenues are up four 4% Cloud business grew 6% uh Cloud adjusted e up 135% AI revenues grew triple digit year onye paying users of Alibaba AI uh stuff 200% quarteron quarter uh International grew 32% K now grew 16% they re purchased 5.8 billion a stock reduced the float by 2.3% that&#39;s going to get better and better because now they&#39;re shifting from all stock option uh all stock incentives to now cash which I&#39;ve been pounding the table on for a year why are they giving away so much stock so now they&#39;re going to do cash I love cash bonuses restricted over time because cash is a one-time payment a slice of the pie is a forever payment I&#39;d rather give them a one-time payment versus a forever payment they&#39;ve got enough stock they have the same incentives we have as co-owners they cut 6,700 jobs so they&#39;re sewing discipline uh and for the free cash flow which we&#39;re going to spend reiterate we covered with Brendan uh people were worried about that they still did 4.6 billion from operations they did 2.3 billion of free cash flow that was attributable to two things just to reemphasize I&#39;m not going to read the quote again but uh working capital as it related to taking down proactively taking down the wholesale I&#39;m sorry the direct sales business at tbow t-all um and um and by the way that noise in the background they&#39;re cutting a bunch of trees on the property so uh just we&#39;ll just deal with it um so that was one and number two uh investment in AI Cloud because they can&#39;t keep up with demand so they got to build new servers new data centers because the compute demand is literally unlimited and they&#39;re the number one player so it all they have to do is suck in all these people now at low margins and then once they&#39;ve dominated everything then they can raise price once everyone&#39;s stuck on their stuff the switching costs are higher than you think it&#39;s a pain in the ass if you&#39;re a CTO you don&#39;t want to switch if you don&#39;t have to so you let you know inertia is the name of the game um internal and external ecommer market share ah this is key so internal and external data about e-commerce players market share Dynamics indicates a positive trend in gradual market share stabilization so they they lost they they stopped losing share and they&#39;re actually starting to regain share is what they said in the Q&amp;A section um also their CMR growth uh the the GM gross merchandise volume growth grew High grew double digits the CMR gr growth the margin on that didn&#39;t grow as fast because obviously they&#39;re they&#39;re now boxing out teu and uh pindu Duo bigger they&#39;re better they&#39;re going to kick them in the teeth the economy is going to recover and then the higher end stuff where which they own uh is going to dominate but in the meantime they&#39;re like we&#39;re going to even kick them where where we don&#39;t play and we&#39;re going to go after them in the low-end lowquality stuff and we&#39;re going to do that for a while which they did and that impacted their CMR but they expect that to catch up to G gross merchandise value very very quickly cuz they had to move fast which they did and now they&#39;re caught up and the margins are going to go back so we&#39;re confident that alibaba&#39;s overall Revenue excluding Alibaba Consolidated subsidiaries will return to double digit growth in the second half of the fiscal year with gradual acceleration thereafter they still have 26.1 billion remaining on the share repurchase availability and as we&#39; covered with Brendan he believes what we believe that they will no they will no longer be limited in their ability to do BuyBacks because they can&#39;t get us uh they they can&#39;t get their cash outside of China uh now they&#39;ll be able to buy on the southbound connect and so they won&#39;t have to issue these convertible preper preferreds and then buy them back to be anti-dilutive so they can get cash out of the country uh out of the country cash they can now just buy stock on the southbound stock connect uh once that goes through and that&#39;s going to enable them to do unlimited BuyBacks to the extent that they want is limited to the extent that they can access cash even though they have unlimited amounts of cash in China they had trouble with the amount of cash they had outside of China that&#39;s no longer going to be an issue uh quote we&#39;ve started to replace a portion of alibaba&#39;s ESOP incentives with long-term cash incentives for our employees start starting last quarter these cash incentives will be reflected as costs while it will change compens lower adjusted eida it will also result in less ESOP delution in the future that is huge ladies and gentlemen uh uh also as far as Alibaba Cloud we are confident that revenue from external customers will return to double digit growth in the second half of the fiscal year with gradual acceleration thereafter this is becoming a growth company again ladies and gentlemen and it&#39;s priced like a cigar butt and that&#39;s going to change and when it changes and rates it&#39;s going to be very very quick expecting double digit Revenue in Cloud accelerate moving forward uh the other thing is the analysts are like aren&#39;t you seeing a Slowdown cool qu what we see certainly among our own cloud customers is that their AI budgets for this year are higher significantly higher than they were last year any Enterprise that is digitized and relies on digitization must be investing it has to be investing in AI all the industry is now uh that are using AI are leveraging it to enhance their competitiveness and efficiency so any Enterprise that&#39;s in any way digitally Reliant will certainly not scale down its investment in AI because to do so would impair their own competitiveness and efficiency so that&#39;s a clear Trend we&#39;re seeing and we are not seeing any kind of slowdown or softening this was a key reason we got involved with Alibaba to start with is their Cloud hegemony why the CFO sees free cash flow decline as temporary which we covered so he&#39;s basically saying um Let me let me explain this I I I it Bears such important repeating as it relates to free cash flow okay because for doing one p business on the one hand you are buying inventory from the vendor on the other hand you sell it and does the vendor normally give you a credit term like 60 days or 90 days if you can make the inventory turnover I.E sell inventory within a short period of time shorter than the short sort of credit term you&#39;re given actually you are generating cash flow particularly if the size is going up you&#39;re generating positive cash flow on the contrary if you&#39;re reducing scale like they are with the direct sales business on purpose uh you will have outflow on working capital but is that is that a temporary impact to me I think this is relatively uh he says is this is this a permanent impact to me I think this is a relatively temporary impact during the process of reducing scale we will see this outflow but when the business size become stable we will no longer see these types of outflow okay so why are they doing the capex that was the second thing that imp impacted uh free cash flow and it&#39;s simply because quote we see a lot of demand a lot of unmet demand from many clients this is related to AI capex uh and you look at the pipeline those clients have you know there&#39;s going to be ongoing demand so whether it&#39;s training inference or API calls what we see we&#39;re making these kind of capex Investments quote as soon as we get a server up a server is instantly running at full capacity there&#39;s that kind of demand so we can expect to see a very high Roi over these next quarters because we&#39;re building compute power to meet existing demand and that new compute power coming online is getting instantly taken up and running at full capacity on day one huge ladies and gentlemen um so high single digit gmv growth double digit order growth uh this quarter some other other C we we covered most of them I just want to get some of these Stars here you can read this on your own the 88 VIP members that&#39;s like a paid subscription like Prime uh increase double digits year-over-year surpassing 42 million during the quarter pretty serious no one ever talks about it uh number of paying users using alibaba&#39;s Cloud AI platform has increased by over 200% quarter on quoter it&#39;s unbelievable um okay uh driven by double digit uh okay uh Cloud grew 6% driven by double digit public Cloud growth increasing adoption of AI related products AI related product Revenue continued to grow at triple digits year-over-year we continue to invest in customers and Technology particular AI infrastructure to increase Cloud adoption and for a the AI to maintain our our market share leadership uh significant double digit Revenue okay so we covered that uh aidc that&#39;s the international grew 32% year-over-year K now the log ICS 16% year-over-year local Services Group 12% year-over-year even the digital media grew 4% year-over-year all right let&#39;s see here some of these key stars and then we can move on we&#39;ve got still a lot to cover this week uh I was going to release Brendan&#39;s interview separately but then I just thought it would be confusing so we put it all in here uh notable okay Alibaba cloud has gained notable recognition as the cloud service provider of choice for AI uh according to recently released Gartner which is the industry standard uh Magic for data science and machine learning platforms report Alibaba cloud has been mentioned as the only Asia based cloud service provider among Global players uh code gener while enhancing s 27 language number paying users on Alibaba Cloud AI platform increased over 200% covered all this covered this covered that okay uh our focus on enhancing user experience by offering quality products at attractive prices with great service led to stabilizing market share of tbal and t-all group as we return the business to the growth trajectory the cloud business achieve positive Revenue momentum driven by public cloud and AI related products maintain our we continue to invest to maintain our Market leadership we invest for growth in our Core Business while reducing losses in other business to operating efficiency which they did a good job that&#39;s why the sell side was so happy uh 5.8 billion of shares late uh repurchases underscores our confidence in business Outlook all right um okay next increase covered that I just don&#39;t want to miss anything because there&#39;s so many important points in what happened talked about the reversals look at these business units Top Line every single one China Commerce up 1% the direct sales they&#39;re winding down on purpose as we discussed the uh wholesale up 16% the overall if they weren&#39;t proactively turning that down I think it was like high mid single digit growth uh Cloud intelligence up 6% you know and then you just go line by line every single unit is up every single unit is up that&#39;s what we call a turnaround ladies and gentlemen that&#39;s why turnarounds are so critical what you need is Cash on the balance sheet and uh or options to pay down debt they don&#39;t have any of those problems and they&#39;re actually reaccelerating so they&#39;re like late stage turnaround now they&#39;re into growth re acceleration can go through all those just trying to make sure that I didn&#39;t miss any key things I wanted to cover here covered a lot of them with Brendan still have 84 billion dollars worth of cash by the way net cash whatever it is 65 billion I think they got 20 billion of debt uh they called the employees which we covered for another stabilization uh triple digit growth we covered that through intensive R&amp;D investment we aim to sustain profitable growth while establishing ourselves as a leading Cloud as a leading cloud provider for AI with healthy profitability and market share leadership uh profit 32% year on year okay so in conclusion our strategic focus is twofold enhancing operational efficiency across all business segments while on the other hand actively investing in the key markets to drive quality growth in scale with the goal of achieving more substantial profitability at scale in the future um winning the Mind share of our consumers purchased 630 million ordinary Shares are 77 million ads for a total of 5.8 billion 2.3% net reduction we talked about the long-term cash incentives this is a big deal increasing investment led to better consumer retention increased the purchase frequency and positive feedback regarding overall shopping experience uh consolid okay Cloud We Believe strengthen our Market leadership 4% okay increasing this investment okay yeah Solutions all right so you can go through this line by line stream okay now as the market share stabilizes what we certainly see in this quarter we can start to accelerate the pace of our monetization efforts that&#39;s what that CMR was the margins the volumes are growing like crazy the margins now are going to re accelerate they can start to do monetization now that they&#39;ve stabilized the ship uh there are a few factors you&#39;ll have to look at first the various new products we&#39;ve launched including live streaming uh including the uh R&amp;B 10 billion subsidy program which resulted in higher user return and high and return to platforms and high user repurchase rates but it&#39;s going to take a bit of time to roll out the new monetization approaches and products for them to gain traction new advertising product we&#39;re introducing uh the first me okay so first they got the traffic second a sufficient number of advertising takeen apart covered that they talk about the 60 basis points on all transactions starting in September that&#39;s huge uh hundreds of millions to the bottom line go looking long run AI okay so they&#39;re aiming to get the approval from shareholders and get it completed before the end of August which means it uh the Chinese could be able to start to buy Alibaba stock as soon as early September um so half of their Cloud growth is going to be driven by AI products uh versus the CPU U stuff uh anyting certainly got that so there&#39;s just so much good detail in here secondly the software service Fe will take ah software service fee will also help on the take rate few other short measures as well so these are the things we&#39;ve currently been why we started to do it because we see growth back on the gmv and we see the sign of stabilizing market share so they could only charge this if they had confidence that they&#39;ve started to regain share and they&#39;re back on a growth trajectory you know you don&#39;t raise prices on Merchants uh if you think you&#39;re the sick the the ship is sinking you only do that when you&#39;re back to growth and that&#39;s that&#39;s where they are okay uh I think the reason clearly a very strong backlog continue investing simply because we see a lot of demand okay we expect to continue to be investing in AI capex at the same Pace simply because we see a lot of demand a lot of unmet demand from many clients and you look at the pipeline those clients have you know there&#39;s going to be ongoing demand\n### TECHNICAL_CHARTS\nand you can see these different um indicators interestingly enough the worldwide box office year-to date ladies and gentlemen what are the top top two films they&#39;re Disney inside out to Deadpool and Wolverine uh was actually the largest R-rated movie box office in the history of box offices so the idea that no one&#39;s going to the movie theaters is apparently inaccurate Microsoft has accelerated heavy investments in AI reason I put this chart is so you can see the magnitude and you can see why that shift from magnificent 7 to 493 is happening and is going to continue to happen uh not because they&#39;re going to crash or anything but because their margins are going to be crimped from all their investment and their earnings growth is decelerating from 50% to 20% doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s going out of business it just means that the relative value is going to be outside those groups in terms of outperformance and we covered some of that Bond Bond and Equity Universe um this is really interesting the value of all Global bonds and stocks is 255 trillion the value of all Global bonds is 130 trillion the value all Global stocks is 125 trillion so when you have a company like you know apple or Nvidia get up to these four and five trillion dollar valuations you know when you back it out and you just measure it relative to GDP and measure it relative to uh the global value of every stock on Earth you can start to see how some of these have gotten a little bit ahead of their skis and if you zoom out as we always say you can discern and take advantage of those um opportunities to stay away so or or uh trim you know as you know we&#39;ve done uh well before any of this uh Yen dislocation and all that stuff was happening Financial assets are worth 233% of global GDP they peaked in 2019 at 270 billion wor 270% of global GDP the value of Wall Street relative to the value of Main Street is almost back at record highs um negative yielding debt has dropped from 18 trillion to zero in the last four years so there was a lot of negative yielding debt if you think of jgbs uh even um real yields on treasuries were negative and now that&#39;s back to more normalized levels uh top five stocks in the S&amp;P 500 peaked at 29% of the market in July of 2024 we said it was bananas that has now rolled over magnificent 7 reached market cap reached a record high of $17 trillion in July 2024 when we were getting out of uh Amazon getting out of Google that we bought in October 2022 when no one wanted it and you can see that that rolling over um 17 trillion again you say wow $17 trillion well they&#39;re great companies okay are they worth one fifth of the entire world of global equities like there are 10,000 Global equities let&#39;s just say there&#39;s probably more call it 12,000 uh Global equities these are you know five stocks should be 20% of all the value of all of the markets in the world it&#39;s a little extreme and these extremes always get corrected as you see over and over and over so they get corrected in part by the others growing and in part by them either staying static or coming in a little bit to more normalized valuations uh Tech Telecom Healthcare peaked at 45% of global equities in July 2024 we haven&#39;t seen that level since uh 22000 okay so that that&#39;s where you want to be where you want to avoid uh you got to pay attention to stuff like that uh this is the cross asset returns from 2010 to 2024 and the thing the reason I&#39;d like to show this uh and boy you guys are getting a lot of value per dollar this week I hope you&#39;re drinking coffee to catch keep up with me here um it the reason I show these is because what you can see is the last shall be first is a very consistent theme just look at gold gold was on top in 2010 by 2013 it was at the bottom by 2016 it was back on top by 2020 it was way on top then it collapsed into 2021 now it&#39;s reisen everyone wants gold it&#39;s going to be back on the bottom in the next few years no it can&#39;t be on the bottom central banks are buying it central banks have been the biggest Contra indicator since the biggest since the beginning of time so if you just do the opposite so they&#39;ll they&#39;ll they&#39;ll buy more and then it&#39;ll change same same if you look at these cross asset returns uh from in the 2000s you couldn&#39;t give away emerging markets in 2000 by 2003 it was the top performing asset did 56% that that year the next year it did 26% the next year it did 34% this is exactly where we are ladies and gentlemen we are going to be um finding ourselves in a position where they start to outperform two years ago they two years ago they did1 19 -2 last two years they&#39;re up double digits they&#39;re just getting started that&#39;s what you saw in 200 2001 and 2002 they came out of the doldrums and then they made it to the top which is probably next year um but just look at these patterns that&#39;s the one thing that I&#39;m very good at is pattern recognition and um um you look at every single decade here was another decade everyone says like oh you know us exceptionalism I agree us exceptionalism that doesn&#39;t mean that International stocks should underperform forever and the answer is they didn&#39;t they outperformed in the80s believe it or not remember they were down on the vulker era then by 83 21% 12% 25% 10% 22% 40% 65% I mean it was the best performing asset in the 80s then the 90 it took the break because the uh Tech took over and then in the 2000s it had its biggest run ever from 2001 to 2007 so what have we had we&#39;ve had the same thing we had it run in 2020 take a break due to the tech Mania from uh the last 10 years and now it&#39;ll be back this 10 years you watch what happens it&#39;s history doesn&#39;t rhyme but it does repeat look at the 70s what Emerging Markets did top of the Shelf every single year I mean 14% 36% 30% in 1973 13.5% when the US market collapsed 26% it was down 15 then it was back up back up back up top of the chart these will be back ladies and gentlemen um all right so you get the point crowded trades uh you can look here too where the dividend yields are by sector uh energy is a big dividend yield as rates cut people are going to want dividends financials reats utilities have already run up ahead of it uh price to earnings where are the lowest price to earnings ratios energy uh financials re utilities trailing price to earnings Price to Book ratios Etc so burden yourself with data that&#39;s all I can suggest uh it works the bull bear indicator is not yet at the extreme bullishness level where you want to sell that&#39;s from Bank of America restaurant spending is falling a little bit you&#39;re seeing that in the lowest end of the consumer uh retail sales though is still strong because in aggregate um people are spending I I think it was like the top 20% does 50% I I don&#39;t know there&#39;s so so much data but yes there are Crosswinds the FED does need to cut it&#39;s not all roses and green shoots uh but if they act quickly enough like they did in 95 all will be well on that front\n\n\n###

is I will tell you how to become rich close the doors be fearful when others are greedy be greedy when others are fearful\n### HEADLINES_AND_NEWS\nBuyBacks through the roof you can see it here uh we went oh this is interesting from Goldman Sachs I referenced fast lane and the checkout system that increases conversion from 50% to 80% while just a couple of days after PayPal announced a partnership with Aiden which is a huge payments processor in Europe to offer fast lane and here&#39;s what Goldman Sachs had to say about it uh aen offering fast lane to its Enterprise Merchant and and Marketplace customers fast lane allows first-time users to save their C card and shipping information then automatically pre-fills these fields at Merchants using fast lane for all future purchases this improves guest checkout conversion rate to 80 plus% and reduces time to check out by 32% uh we view the announcement as a positive development for PayPal as distribution for Fast Lane expands expands particularly if offered via aen addan which has strong Global Enterprise relationships in particular we believe the distribution of Fast Lane through similar to branded checkout and other payment methods shows increased ability to compete versus other methods of online checkout we also see this as consistent with Management&#39;s commentary around the potential to unbundle fast lane from branded and unbranded checkout which we believe helps PayPal to compete on a more similar playing field to Apple pay and Google pay uh we see this as a positive for PayPal&#39;s distribution and continued sign of the strong execution at the company since the current management team took the the helm IE Alex Chris who came from into it who ran 50% of the business while over 10 years that stock was a 38 bagger so um we&#39;re excited about that we covered uh Charles this is critically important you will understand the significance of the chart below after you listen to my conversation with Charles Payne and and which you just did and read the article from last week here&#39;s the link to the article from last week this by the way not only goes into our updates last week but it has links back to our original thesis uh when we got involved in the company in May of 2022 at $510 um so per share you will understand as it relates to vehicle incentives one of our loyal podcast video cast viewers hat tip to Stephen Frampton sent us this updated updated chart from Cox Automotive uh and then I&#39;ve made these annotations on it and here&#39;s what we&#39;ve been saying people have been worried oh my gosh dealer inventories are growing they&#39;re increasing incentives increasing incentives are the name of the game when you want volume we are not in the business of Ford and GM making as much money per car as possible we are in the business of Ford and GM making as many cars as possible that is the critical name of the game and so right now vehicle incentives are at 7% of total purchase price in 2017 they got up to 11% of total purchase price and average incentives in July Rose to 7% uh or 33 3,383 per car up from 6.4% in June and the most generous level seen in 2024 incentives are now Higher by 59.1% compared to one year ago when the average incentive package was 4.4% of of uh total purchase price in July of 2023 new vehicle incentives in July were at their highest point in more than three years this is huge this is going to show us big volumes because like I said the cartel that GM and Ford and Stanis had during covid when they could control Supply and charge as much as humanly possible per car um uh is is over okay and now you know the Koreans are putting in cheaper cars and they&#39;re going to have to buy make smaller cars massive cars massive volume and CPS gets paid per car and it&#39;s it&#39;s pretty much the same amount of cars parts per car uh except for the fact if you go to hybrids it dramatically increases the cost per vehicle for Cooper standard in other words Hy hybrids are even better than uh internal combustion and EVS as well which are slowing demand but the big where they make all the biggest amount of money is the hybrids uh I are good uh EVS are good but I think demand is waning for EVS all right Alibaba update so we covered with Brendan the this 20 billion coming in they had a shareholder vote today I&#39;m sure there&#39;ll be an announcement tomorrow I&#39;m sure that went through in which case the southbound link opens which could be as early as September 9th uh we were talking about $20 billion of flows uh Brendan referenced maybe 30 or 40 billion of inflows which would be 20% of the float which would be absolutely unbelievable but I think that&#39;s true like if you&#39;ve got you know if you weren&#39;t allowed to own Amazon for all these years and you have three boxes a day coming to your door and you&#39;re you know buying books and audibles and watching their videos and a Prime member subscriber and all of a sudden you have the chance to participate in that and buy it you&#39;re going to buy it hand over fist and I think the Chinese you know it&#39;s the national champion I think it&#39;s going to be uh um you know over subscribed so to speak in terms of demand so that&#39;s that they went through the historic stuff here next plan the vote is today and stock connect on September 9th you can see in the Bloomberg article also we covered with Brendan the uh 60 basis points on um t-all and tawau transactions which is in line with their competitors JD and Pino Doo has been doing it for a while they&#39;re now going to get that that&#39;s 343 million to the bottom line and more that&#39;s on last year sales so prospectively it starts in September that&#39;s straight to the bottom line and then even the cell side got excited after earnings uh Bank of America came out um talking about um profit let&#39;s see reiterate Buy on improving growth Outlook uh solid in investor return execution profit beats consensus as enhanced cost disciplines across the business uh and then they go through the growth and the expectations Etc so the key highlights here we covered quite a few of them total revenues are up four 4% Cloud business grew 6% uh Cloud adjusted e up 135% AI revenues grew triple digit year onye paying users of Alibaba AI uh stuff 200% quarteron quarter uh International grew 32% K now grew 16% they re purchased 5.8 billion a stock reduced the float by 2.3% that&#39;s going to get better and better because now they&#39;re shifting from all stock option uh all stock incentives to now cash which I&#39;ve been pounding the table on for a year why are they giving away so much stock so now they&#39;re going to do cash I love cash bonuses restricted over time because cash is a one-time payment a slice of the pie is a forever payment I&#39;d rather give them a one-time payment versus a forever payment they&#39;ve got enough stock they have the same incentives we have as co-owners they cut 6,700 jobs so they&#39;re sewing discipline uh and for the free cash flow which we&#39;re going to spend reiterate we covered with Brendan uh people were worried about that they still did 4.6 billion from operations they did 2.3 billion of free cash flow that was attributable to two things just to reemphasize I&#39;m not going to read the quote again but uh working capital as it related to taking down proactively taking down the wholesale I&#39;m sorry the direct sales business at tbow t-all um and um and by the way that noise in the background they&#39;re cutting a bunch of trees on the property so uh just we&#39;ll just deal with it um so that was one and number two uh investment in AI Cloud because they can&#39;t keep up with demand so they got to build new servers new data centers because the compute demand is literally unlimited and they&#39;re the number one player so it all they have to do is suck in all these people now at low margins and then once they&#39;ve dominated everything then they can raise price once everyone&#39;s stuck on their stuff the switching costs are higher than you think it&#39;s a pain in the ass if you&#39;re a CTO you don&#39;t want to switch if you don&#39;t have to so you let you know inertia is the name of the game um internal and external ecommer market share ah this is key so internal and external data about e-commerce players market share Dynamics indicates a positive trend in gradual market share stabilization so they they lost they they stopped losing share and they&#39;re actually starting to regain share is what they said in the Q&amp;A section um also their CMR growth uh the the GM gross merchandise volume growth grew High grew double digits the CMR gr growth the margin on that didn&#39;t grow as fast because obviously they&#39;re they&#39;re now boxing out teu and uh pindu Duo bigger they&#39;re better they&#39;re going to kick them in the teeth the economy is going to recover and then the higher end stuff where which they own uh is going to dominate but in the meantime they&#39;re like we&#39;re going to even kick them where where we don&#39;t play and we&#39;re going to go after them in the low-end lowquality stuff and we&#39;re going to do that for a while which they did and that impacted their CMR but they expect that to catch up to G gross merchandise value very very quickly cuz they had to move fast which they did and now they&#39;re caught up and the margins are going to go back so we&#39;re confident that alibaba&#39;s overall Revenue excluding Alibaba Consolidated subsidiaries will return to double digit growth in the second half of the fiscal year with gradual acceleration thereafter they still have 26.1 billion remaining on the share repurchase availability and as we&#39; covered with Brendan he believes what we believe that they will no they will no longer be limited in their ability to do BuyBacks because they can&#39;t get us uh they they can&#39;t get their cash outside of China uh now they&#39;ll be able to buy on the southbound connect and so they won&#39;t have to issue these convertible preper preferreds and then buy them back to be anti-dilutive so they can get cash out of the country uh out of the country cash they can now just buy stock on the southbound stock connect uh once that goes through and that&#39;s going to enable them to do unlimited BuyBacks to the extent that they want is limited to the extent that they can access cash even though they have unlimited amounts of cash in China they had trouble with the amount of cash they had outside of China that&#39;s no longer going to be an issue uh quote we&#39;ve started to replace a portion of alibaba&#39;s ESOP incentives with long-term cash incentives for our employees start starting last quarter these cash incentives will be reflected as costs while it will change compens lower adjusted eida it will also result in less ESOP delution in the future that is huge ladies and gentlemen uh uh also as far as Alibaba Cloud we are confident that revenue from external customers will return to double digit growth in the second half of the fiscal year with gradual acceleration thereafter this is becoming a growth company again ladies and gentlemen and it&#39;s priced like a cigar butt and that&#39;s going to change and when it changes and rates it&#39;s going to be very very quick expecting double digit Revenue in Cloud accelerate moving forward uh the other thing is the analysts are like aren&#39;t you seeing a Slowdown cool qu what we see certainly among our own cloud customers is that their AI budgets for this year are higher significantly higher than they were last year any Enterprise that is digitized and relies on digitization must be investing it has to be investing in AI all the industry is now uh that are using AI are leveraging it to enhance their competitiveness and efficiency so any Enterprise that&#39;s in any way digitally Reliant will certainly not scale down its investment in AI because to do so would impair their own competitiveness and efficiency so that&#39;s a clear Trend we&#39;re seeing and we are not seeing any kind of slowdown or softening this was a key reason we got involved with Alibaba to start with is their Cloud hegemony why the CFO sees free cash flow decline as temporary which we covered so he&#39;s basically saying um Let me let me explain this I I I it Bears such important repeating as it relates to free cash flow okay because for doing one p business on the one hand you are buying inventory from the vendor on the other hand you sell it and does the vendor normally give you a credit term like 60 days or 90 days if you can make the inventory turnover I.E sell inventory within a short period of time shorter than the short sort of credit term you&#39;re given actually you are generating cash flow particularly if the size is going up you&#39;re generating positive cash flow on the contrary if you&#39;re reducing scale like they are with the direct sales business on purpose uh you will have outflow on working capital but is that is that a temporary impact to me I think this is relatively uh he says is this is this a permanent impact to me I think this is a relatively temporary impact during the process of reducing scale we will see this outflow but when the business size become stable we will no longer see these types of outflow okay so why are they doing the capex that was the second thing that imp impacted uh free cash flow and it&#39;s simply because quote we see a lot of demand a lot of unmet demand from many clients this is related to AI capex uh and you look at the pipeline those clients have you know there&#39;s going to be ongoing demand so whether it&#39;s training inference or API calls what we see we&#39;re making these kind of capex Investments quote as soon as we get a server up a server is instantly running at full capacity there&#39;s that kind of demand so we can expect to see a very high Roi over these next quarters because we&#39;re building compute power to meet existing demand and that new compute power coming online is getting instantly taken up and running at full capacity on day one huge ladies and gentlemen um so high single digit gmv growth double digit order growth uh this quarter some other other C we we covered most of them I just want to get some of these Stars here you can read this on your own the 88 VIP members that&#39;s like a paid subscription like Prime uh increase double digits year-over-year surpassing 42 million during the quarter pretty serious no one ever talks about it uh number of paying users using alibaba&#39;s Cloud AI platform has increased by over 200% quarter on quoter it&#39;s unbelievable um okay uh driven by double digit uh okay uh Cloud grew 6% driven by double digit public Cloud growth increasing adoption of AI related products AI related product Revenue continued to grow at triple digits year-over-year we continue to invest in customers and Technology particular AI infrastructure to increase Cloud adoption and for a the AI to maintain our our market share leadership uh significant double digit Revenue okay so we covered that uh aidc that&#39;s the international grew 32% year-over-year K now the log ICS 16% year-over-year local Services Group 12% year-over-year even the digital media grew 4% year-over-year all right let&#39;s see here some of these key stars and then we can move on we&#39;ve got still a lot to cover this week uh I was going to release Brendan&#39;s interview separately but then I just thought it would be confusing so we put it all in here uh notable okay Alibaba cloud has gained notable recognition as the cloud service provider of choice for AI uh according to recently released Gartner which is the industry standard uh Magic for data science and machine learning platforms report Alibaba cloud has been mentioned as the only Asia based cloud service provider among Global players uh code gener while enhancing s 27 language number paying users on Alibaba Cloud AI platform increased over 200% covered all this covered this covered that okay uh our focus on enhancing user experience by offering quality products at attractive prices with great service led to stabilizing market share of tbal and t-all group as we return the business to the growth trajectory the cloud business achieve positive Revenue momentum driven by public cloud and AI related products maintain our we continue to invest to maintain our Market leadership we invest for growth in our Core Business while reducing losses in other business to operating efficiency which they did a good job that&#39;s why the sell side was so happy uh 5.8 billion of shares late uh repurchases underscores our confidence in business Outlook all right um okay next increase covered that I just don&#39;t want to miss anything because there&#39;s so many important points in what happened talked about the reversals look at these business units Top Line every single one China Commerce up 1% the direct sales they&#39;re winding down on purpose as we discussed the uh wholesale up 16% the overall if they weren&#39;t proactively turning that down I think it was like high mid single digit growth uh Cloud intelligence up 6% you know and then you just go line by line every single unit is up every single unit is up that&#39;s what we call a turnaround ladies and gentlemen that&#39;s why turnarounds are so critical what you need is Cash on the balance sheet and uh or options to pay down debt they don&#39;t have any of those problems and they&#39;re actually reaccelerating so they&#39;re like late stage turnaround now they&#39;re into growth re acceleration can go through all those just trying to make sure that I didn&#39;t miss any key things I wanted to cover here covered a lot of them with Brendan still have 84 billion dollars worth of cash by the way net cash whatever it is 65 billion I think they got 20 billion of debt uh they called the employees which we covered for another stabilization uh triple digit growth we covered that through intensive R&amp;D investment we aim to sustain profitable growth while establishing ourselves as a leading Cloud as a leading cloud provider for AI with healthy profitability and market share leadership uh profit 32% year on year okay so in conclusion our strategic focus is twofold enhancing operational efficiency across all business segments while on the other hand actively investing in the key markets to drive quality growth in scale with the goal of achieving more substantial profitability at scale in the future um winning the Mind share of our consumers purchased 630 million ordinary Shares are 77 million ads for a total of 5.8 billion 2.3% net reduction we talked about the long-term cash incentives this is a big deal increasing investment led to better consumer retention increased the purchase frequency and positive feedback regarding overall shopping experience uh consolid okay Cloud We Believe strengthen our Market leadership 4% okay increasing this investment okay yeah Solutions all right so you can go through this line by line stream okay now as the market share stabilizes what we certainly see in this quarter we can start to accelerate the pace of our monetization efforts that&#39;s what that CMR was the margins the volumes are growing like crazy the margins now are going to re accelerate they can start to do monetization now that they&#39;ve stabilized the ship uh there are a few factors you&#39;ll have to look at first the various new products we&#39;ve launched including live streaming uh including the uh R&amp;B 10 billion subsidy program which resulted in higher user return and high and return to platforms and high user repurchase rates but it&#39;s going to take a bit of time to roll out the new monetization approaches and products for them to gain traction new advertising product we&#39;re introducing uh the first me okay so first they got the traffic second a sufficient number of advertising takeen apart covered that they talk about the 60 basis points on all transactions starting in September that&#39;s huge uh hundreds of millions to the bottom line go looking long run AI okay so they&#39;re aiming to get the approval from shareholders and get it completed before the end of August which means it uh the Chinese could be able to start to buy Alibaba stock as soon as early September um so half of their Cloud growth is going to be driven by AI products uh versus the CPU U stuff uh anyting certainly got that so there&#39;s just so much good detail in here secondly the software service Fe will take ah software service fee will also help on the take rate few other short measures as well so these are the things we&#39;ve currently been why we started to do it because we see growth back on the gmv and we see the sign of stabilizing market share so they could only charge this if they had confidence that they&#39;ve started to regain share and they&#39;re back on a growth trajectory you know you don&#39;t raise prices on Merchants uh if you think you&#39;re the sick the the ship is sinking you only do that when you&#39;re back to growth and that&#39;s that&#39;s where they are okay uh I think the reason clearly a very strong backlog continue investing simply because we see a lot of demand okay we expect to continue to be investing in AI capex at the same Pace simply because we see a lot of demand a lot of unmet demand from many clients and you look at the pipeline those clients have you know there&#39;s going to be ongoing demand\n### TECHNICAL_CHARTS\nand you can see these different um indicators interestingly enough the worldwide box office year-to date ladies and gentlemen what are the top top two films they&#39;re Disney inside out to Deadpool and Wolverine uh was actually the largest R-rated movie box office in the history of box offices so the idea that no one&#39;s going to the movie theaters is apparently inaccurate Microsoft has accelerated heavy investments in AI reason I put this chart is so you can see the magnitude and you can see why that shift from magnificent 7 to 493 is happening and is going to continue to happen uh not because they&#39;re going to crash or anything but because their margins are going to be crimped from all their investment and their earnings growth is decelerating from 50% to 20% doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s going out of business it just means that the relative value is going to be outside those groups in terms of outperformance and we covered some of that Bond Bond and Equity Universe um this is really interesting the value of all Global bonds and stocks is 255 trillion the value of all Global bonds is 130 trillion the value all Global stocks is 125 trillion so when you have a company like you know apple or Nvidia get up to these four and five trillion dollar valuations you know when you back it out and you just measure it relative to GDP and measure it relative to uh the global value of every stock on Earth you can start to see how some of these have gotten a little bit ahead of their skis and if you zoom out as we always say you can discern and take advantage of those um opportunities to stay away so or or uh trim you know as you know we&#39;ve done uh well before any of this uh Yen dislocation and all that stuff was happening Financial assets are worth 233% of global GDP they peaked in 2019 at 270 billion wor 270% of global GDP the value of Wall Street relative to the value of Main Street is almost back at record highs um negative yielding debt has dropped from 18 trillion to zero in the last four years so there was a lot of negative yielding debt if you think of jgbs uh even um real yields on treasuries were negative and now that&#39;s back to more normalized levels uh top five stocks in the S&amp;P 500 peaked at 29% of the market in July of 2024 we said it was bananas that has now rolled over magnificent 7 reached market cap reached a record high of $17 trillion in July 2024 when we were getting out of uh Amazon getting out of Google that we bought in October 2022 when no one wanted it and you can see that that rolling over um 17 trillion again you say wow $17 trillion well they&#39;re great companies okay are they worth one fifth of the entire world of global equities like there are 10,000 Global equities let&#39;s just say there&#39;s probably more call it 12,000 uh Global equities these are you know five stocks should be 20% of all the value of all of the markets in the world it&#39;s a little extreme and these extremes always get corrected as you see over and over and over so they get corrected in part by the others growing and in part by them either staying static or coming in a little bit to more normalized valuations uh Tech Telecom Healthcare peaked at 45% of global equities in July 2024 we haven&#39;t seen that level since uh 22000 okay so that that&#39;s where you want to be where you want to avoid uh you got to pay attention to stuff like that uh this is the cross asset returns from 2010 to 2024 and the thing the reason I&#39;d like to show this uh and boy you guys are getting a lot of value per dollar this week I hope you&#39;re drinking coffee to catch keep up with me here um it the reason I show these is because what you can see is the last shall be first is a very consistent theme just look at gold gold was on top in 2010 by 2013 it was at the bottom by 2016 it was back on top by 2020 it was way on top then it collapsed into 2021 now it&#39;s reisen everyone wants gold it&#39;s going to be back on the bottom in the next few years no it can&#39;t be on the bottom central banks are buying it central banks have been the biggest Contra indicator since the biggest since the beginning of time so if you just do the opposite so they&#39;ll they&#39;ll they&#39;ll buy more and then it&#39;ll change same same if you look at these cross asset returns uh from in the 2000s you couldn&#39;t give away emerging markets in 2000 by 2003 it was the top performing asset did 56% that that year the next year it did 26% the next year it did 34% this is exactly where we are ladies and gentlemen we are going to be um finding ourselves in a position where they start to outperform two years ago they two years ago they did1 19 -2 last two years they&#39;re up double digits they&#39;re just getting started that&#39;s what you saw in 200 2001 and 2002 they came out of the doldrums and then they made it to the top which is probably next year um but just look at these patterns that&#39;s the one thing that I&#39;m very good at is pattern recognition and um um you look at every single decade here was another decade everyone says like oh you know us exceptionalism I agree us exceptionalism that doesn&#39;t mean that International stocks should underperform forever and the answer is they didn&#39;t they outperformed in the80s believe it or not remember they were down on the vulker era then by 83 21% 12% 25% 10% 22% 40% 65% I mean it was the best performing asset in the 80s then the 90 it took the break because the uh Tech took over and then in the 2000s it had its biggest run ever from 2001 to 2007 so what have we had we&#39;ve had the same thing we had it run in 2020 take a break due to the tech Mania from uh the last 10 years and now it&#39;ll be back this 10 years you watch what happens it&#39;s history doesn&#39;t rhyme but it does repeat look at the 70s what Emerging Markets did top of the Shelf every single year I mean 14% 36% 30% in 1973 13.5% when the US market collapsed 26% it was down 15 then it was back up back up back up top of the chart these will be back ladies and gentlemen um all right so you get the point crowded trades uh you can look here too where the dividend yields are by sector uh energy is a big dividend yield as rates cut people are going to want dividends financials reats utilities have already run up ahead of it uh price to earnings where are the lowest price to earnings ratios energy uh financials re utilities trailing price to earnings Price to Book ratios Etc so burden yourself with data that&#39;s all I can suggest uh it works the bull bear indicator is not yet at the extreme bullishness level where you want to sell that&#39;s from Bank of America restaurant spending is falling a little bit you&#39;re seeing that in the lowest end of the consumer uh retail sales though is still strong because in aggregate um people are spending I I think it was like the top 20% does 50% I I don&#39;t know there&#39;s so so much data but yes there are Crosswinds the FED does need to cut it&#39;s not all roses and green shoots uh but if they act quickly enough like they did in 95 all will be well on that front\n\n\n### MACRO_DATA_SLIDES\nfinancials waiting in the S&P 500 was 22% in 2007 all this stuff reversed to the mean was at a low of 10% during the 2020 lows when we were pounding the table to buy Wells Fargo got a double in that and then um now it&#39;s reverting back to Norm but this has a lot of room to run I know we trimmed a bunch of our city and BAC um that we bought during that Regional banking crisis and made it a really really nice trade on uh but we&#39;re we&#39;re looking to find ways to buy it back in and and the reason is hopefully in September October we&#39;ll get that chance and the reason is is because the m&amp;a and IPO cycle hasn&#39;t even begun so they&#39;re going to make money I just they&#39;ve had you know they basically doubled in a short period of time hit the window and then buy back down low and um and that&#39;s what we&#39;re going to hope to do uh Tech waiting as a percentage of the index we&#39;ve covered this back to 2,000 highs it&#39;s uh it&#39;s not where you want to be but money market funds you know as equities go up as yields go down this money has to find a home and um just like it did in 200920 everyone got into money markets in fear and then it all came back into the market and you added 10 more years of a of a bull run uh develop Market government debt as a percentage of This Is Us debt to GDP we&#39;ve covered this highest debt to GDP since World War II had they get out of in World War II they just let inflation R run above Trend if they&#39;re smart they will let inflation run between 2 and 1 half to 4% for the next 5 years and they act quickly enough and that&#39;s how you can inflate your way out of it that&#39;s how we did it in World War II we&#39;ll get the growth why because we got 72 Millennials at Prime working and spending years average age 34 similar to China by the way that&#39;s why they&#39;re going to have one more parabolic run difference is we have a a a large generation after our Millennials the

in line with this it&#39;s shows strength till mid September then end of September is where you get the weakness early October you get weakness and then you get a recovery in um in late October into November I think this year might not be till November till you get election certainty unless it&#39;s just showing positively that one candidate is that far ahead this rebound looks like it has a little more to go uh and we could even hit new highs in September in late August September before we get defensive shortterm and what else do we have here we&#39;ve got the NASDAQ recovering back I

13 26 39 and 52 weeks after the Vick spikes above 45 which it did a few weeks ago and you see on average a year out it's up 14% every period whether it's 4 we 8 week on average it's up and that's what we're seeing next returns were positive when the First Rate cut did not prede a recession and you can see six months later so even if the market goes down a little bit after the first cut what they're

see six months later so even if the market goes down a little bit after the first cut what they&#39;re trying to say\n### MISCELLANEOUS\nhere is uh 3 months and 6 months later on average it&#39;s up pretty materially over time and if there&#39;s no recession which at 2% GDP growth it&#39;s going to be tough to get two quarters of negative GDP unless they do something stupid and they don&#39;t cut then like you&#39;re going to have deflation uh and a huge problem but um leaving that aside dividend yield is where the action is at inexpensive versus history the cheapest it&#39;s been since 2002 I reemphasize these things because they&#39;re important and if you get the themes you can make a lot of money again\n\n### MACRO_DATA_SLIDES\nhere is  the earnings growth that we continue to emphasize with the Magnificent Seven earnings growth from 34% to 29 to 18 and then the unmagnify from -4% in 2023 to plus 6.5% this year to 13.5% next year and then look at small caps this is awesome 2023 - 12.2% this year plus 7.3% next year plus 37.6% so if you&#39;re skeptical about small caps because because they had a little sell down because of the Yen nonsense uh you&#39;re going to miss the boat ladies and gentlemen it&#39;s going to move bigly in our view small small size factor is historically cheap versus large size Factor growth versus value expensive on a book value basis you can see growth is like obscenely it&#39;s more expensive than it was at the Tech rec Peak uh value versus growth valuations remain well below historic average uh housing starts that&#39;s a function of rates Philadelphia fed manufacturing that was weak that&#39;s why the FED needs to move uh buying conditions U UK retail sales are re accelerating that&#39;s been a core part of our theme of the UK getting back on track uh S&amp;P historical performance post Jackson Hall so they speak tomorrow uh and the only time they screwed it up was in 2022 last year they got it right 2020 I mean that was a strange year so on balance it tends to go up this yellow line next is the Fed balance sheet has come down quite a bit I mean that&#39;s almost uh two trillion that&#39;s pretty good uh this is probably where they&#39;ll end they not going to be able to reduce a lot more of this cycle but uh they did better than most people would expect without causing a recession expectation of losing one&#39;s job at a record high in New York fed survey uh so so that&#39;s that so you know people are on edge fed fed needs to fix that in the next few weeks long-term inflation expectations at lowest since early 2022

policy was this restrictive the FED acted and it was the bottom of equities so look at these four points March 2020 we were one of the few people pounding the table to buy you can review our market watch article I believe it was March 25th it&#39;s on our website of 2020 we were saying we are buyers in the hole and um and it proved to be the bottom two days later literally it was unbelievable um and then um April 2021 OCT 2008 you can go through there a surge in global liquidity is brewing promising a potential economic upswing this is a big deal ladies and gentlemen and um it does support you know first off you got the 30 billion dollar of fed repurchases two you&#39;ve got the most amount of central banks easing uh since the the bottoms in 2020 2009 Etc we&#39;ve covered some of that data in recent weeks so this liquidity surge is not something to be taken lightly which is why we&#39;ve been bullish like crazy since that fourth quarter of 2022 when everyone was hiding under a rock and uh so there you go and and it looks like we&#39;ve got a lot of Runway to go uh Capital spending quarterly so this is what&#39;s going to cause the margin compression Amazon Microsoft alphabet

was the big chart of the week as we had been telling you I mean it&#39;s like tomorrow&#39;s newspaper today listening to this podcast sometimes um and it&#39;s not because we have a crystal ball it&#39;s because we just pay attention to data and recognize patterns consistently and you can too uh after you do it for 20 years I mean it just comes naturally after 20 years I guess golf&#39;s the same way it&#39;s like I go out and have a blowup round and and then I&#39;m like oh wait I&#39;ve only been playing two years uh and I&#39;m like why you know why aren I scratch or whatever and it&#39;s just like no because you suck you&#39;re new and uh you know and then the next day you&#39;re going to go out and shoot an 81 and you know feel better about yourself and uh and keep keep at it so that&#39;s the way it goes but after 20 years I figure I&#39;ll be pretty damn good at it um all right less robust job growth if they don&#39;t cut bigly in the next few meetings meaning 50 to 75 basis points before the end of the year they&#39;re just blind or stupid uh I think that it&#39;s unequivocal they&#39;re going to start easy with the 25 and then Accelerate from there as needed and temper but this was I mean you know when I think about how off these numbers were and it was it was bothering me because it&#39;s also what threw them off when inflation was roaring because because the jobs creation was uh under reported and now it&#39;s been over reported for the last year by almost a million jobs um this is this is something and you&#39;ve seen the rhetoric come out in the last few days from all these fed officials our focus is now on the jobs report because they&#39;re like wait there are a million jobs less than you report it&#39;s like if a public company reports $20 off their accounting is off the stock will sell down 30% if their financials are wrong this Bureau of Labor can get it wrong 12 months in a row by a million jobs and there&#39;s no penalty whatsoever it&#39;s really mind-boggling the penalty is the fed&#39;s been 300 basis points too restrictive than they should have been had they had the accurate data about the jobs reports so there you go let&#39;s move on to our sler stuff from\n\n### MACRO_DATA_SLIDES\nfinancials waiting in the S&P 500 was 22% in 2007 all this stuff reversed to the mean was at a low of 10% during the 2020 lows

they're growing revenues yeah I don't know this is a tough one my friend this like this is just gambling Gamblers Anonymous here I would never buy this for clients I don't think I'd ever buy it personally I don't know just just help me understand why they're going to live I guess SweetWater 420 Shock Top Shock Top isn't that dead um I wouldn't put my own money in it but you might catch it you might catch a wave they might get a favorable you know you got an election coming I don't know who's going to give them smart banking that's been the whole key um oh his view is if Cala and walls win schedule plus schedule one to schedule three what you got I if if if I mean Biden everyone thought Biden was going to help these guys out he didn't do anything so Biden is is uh I think uh Kamala is Biden part two so even if you're right you might not get what you want but it's a free option on it and it option has no expiration so long as they don't run out of cash it could work I just I can't recommend that to youbody I really can't and and and I'm stuck because if it goes to 10 or 20 you're going to hate me and if it goes to zero you're going to hate me so there's no win there I just it's outside of my circle of confidence you know those Brands better than I do I I can't say anything about that Joseph n I'm the golf guy that always comments onbe YouTube I know Joseph and I think you're also an author if I remember correctly uh thanks for your content and being so consistent go Baba anyway been wanting to ask a question forever seems to me every investor believes that Insider management buying is 100% indicator of The Insider management believing the stock will increase and so it would seem to me that t here is a possibility that border of management would buy stock to send this signal to the market even if it didn't believe it I can imagine especially in a company with small market cap or wink wink from the board some CEO or components to be used for this purpose are you aware of any studies on this or examples it would seem that would be easy to figure out t\n\nINS started buying just before bad news comes out I know academics who do these type of things um I wouldn&#39;t get I mean the one thing you want to consider with inside bu how material is it relative to their wealth that that&#39;s you know if it&#39;s token then it could be to send a message but the bottom line is the the studies show they&#39;re right more often than they&#39;re wrong but you got to do your analysis so like if I&#39;m at a point of buying and then I see insiders buying on top of it I get very excited um insiders selling means nothing because they they only buy for one reason they expect the stock to go up um they only sell for one reason and and they don&#39;t get enough bump like it&#39;s not like the stocks going to go up 10% because the CEO buys stock I mean unless it&#39;s some penny stock or Garbage promote um so I wouldn&#39;t be that cynical about it and I wouldn&#39;t consider it that indicative either because some of these guys I look at Insider buys every single day and some of them are buying stocks that are way up fully valued they in other words they drink their own Kool-Aid uh so I get more interested when people are buying a meaningful amount of stock relative to their net worth when the stock is washed out and the balance sheet is good so\n### ASK_ME_ANYTHING_QA\ncan you take another look at Airbnb at this juncture feels like a better play compared to Nike and Lulu if I had to pick one consumer discretionary balance sheet is getting better and better quarter over quarter uh enough free cash flow to start buyback stock new business model from long-term rentals co-hosting with AI coner founder Le CEO seems very motivated yeah I looked at this a couple weeks ago I think and I just passed I I understand what you&#39;re saying um and revenues are going up that income yeah it&#39;s all recovering earnings per share seven so it&#39;s trading at like yeah good earnings growth [Music] multiples yeah I mean they do kind of have a mode in their space just wondering how much of this like people are starting to go around it like in other words once you rent once then you just go right to the owner like f and some of the other companies that blew up with uh outsourc free cash flow looks really good I think you&#39;re going to get another chance below 100 just be patient on it that&#39;s what I would say um and and go spend a lot of time on the conference calls I&#39;d listen to the last eight calls read the annual reports see what they said they were going to do and what they actually did what&#39;s the balance sheet look like 7 billion 1 billion I mean you might have something here I think it&#39;s a little early so hang in there good find uh it&#39;s been on my radar I&#39;ve just not nowhere near ready to do anything with it Aaron Oda thoughts on Toyota no I don&#39;t want any o I don&#39;t want any original equipment manufacturers I want Cooper standard regardless of how cheap it is but Toyota is the only one who got it right that CEO said EVS are not going to have the demand you think and they said you&#39;re wrong you&#39;re wrong when everyone was ESG and blah blah blah and forcing it down people&#39;s throats and um and he actually had to step down and he turned out to be the one that was right and everyone else you know marry bar you know doing cartwheels in Washington blowing shareholders money uh and uh blew it up so um okay Allan B so no no Toyota for me uh hello send it back in when it hits 140 when it&#39;s down another 20% Allan B thanks for putting out the best investment podcast out there and encouraging the long-term mindset on the regular CH take a look at Portillos oh my gosh engage capital I think he&#39;s a member at my club I was supposed to play with him last week and it rained um that&#39;s crazy okay so he&#39;s he&#39;s in that and he&#39;s in BFC which that&#39;s mindboggling that&#39;d be interesting if it&#39;s the same guy uh got to reschedule that that uh 18 but um anyway pushing for a turnaround at Portillos I was at Portillos for the uh Olympic development thing in Texas and I think we we covered it that week and I like it I just wouldn&#39;t put clients in it but maybe now I&#39;d be interested it didn&#39;t have enough operating track record but um this thing is a great business it&#39;s just the restaurant business is really hard um and right now they&#39;re going to get hit by the lower income consumer for a little while um cash flow I think I&#39;m like okay with this one but I wouldn&#39;t put clients in it as too risky but if you take a Long View I think they&#39;ve got a growth trajectory we covered it in more detail like I don&#39;t know four or five four or five months ago I think it was like December of last year maybe eight months ago it&#39;s just growing very slowly uh what&#39;s the cash flow like I think they were burning cash at the time too which bothered me a little bit yeah still negative free cash flow it&#39;s just not a great business it&#39;s a good business a good product it&#39;s just not a great business from a stock standpoint it&#39;s too slow for a business that that that small the growth rate is too low so that&#39;s why it&#39;s like a past it&#39;ll probably work you probably get a double on it but Len McAdams uh could you take a look at Cleveland Cliffs uh yeah that&#39;s in materials I&#39;ve looked at it I like that that guy we we actually talked about this two weeks ago so I&#39;m not going to do it again but thanks for tuning in Len Eric Haney and I said me it&#39;s a meth for me it&#39;ll probably be okay but not for me um I do want to get materials exposure Cliffs all right let me take another look at it going to be having dinner late tonight for my my awesome viewers want me to look at Cliffs let&#39;s see here all right free cash flows good revenues are okay I mean send it back in if it gets to 10 or 9 uh um W it&#39;s a lot of free cash FL what&#39;s the balance sheet look like 3.5 billion on 1002 so that that&#39;s their problem is their balance sheet so you got to know when all of their debt matures what are the terms uh and on that basis then you know I don&#39;t think they&#39;re going to have solvency risk but you know the number one reason thing you need to figure out is why is it down what&#39;s the bearish thesis and why is that incorrect I mean it&#39;s obviously just I just don&#39;t like this type of business that much um yeah so I&#39;m agnostic on that one um Eric Haney big fan for over three years my man good for you thank you for all you do thoughts on atkr this looks like a broken stock what do they do cash flows rolling over their revenues are rolling over um electrical infrastructure products um yeah I just want to know what the turnaround plan is because that&#39;s a pretty precipitous drop in revenue and free cash flow free cash flows haved almost haved in the last couple of years and then uh M yeah I see what you&#39;re seeing I mean just help me understand why these revenues are going to re accelerate and I&#39;d be more interested but it&#39;s from 4 billion down to 3.9 down to 3.2 that&#39;s a big drop um so what&#39;s the plan to stop the bleeding and start to turn it around and then from there you might have something I mean it&#39;s down a bit it was a grow goo growth company for a while 14 to 193 but you know yeah it&#39;s dropped 50% but these broken stocks man once they hurt the institutions could it bounce right back up like it did in 2022 yeah um I don&#39;t know my I don&#39;t know my Spidey extense just says to avoid it for a little while wait for more pain and then revisit it and keep following the thesis remember this business you get paid for inaction versus action you&#39;re much better with errors of omission than errors of commission so be willing to let a few get away from you uh it&#39;s just the way it goes and that that&#39;s good because if you chase every shiny object um you&#39;re just going to spread too thin and you wind up hurt more often you know you want to go in when everything&#39;s pointing in your favor it&#39;s perfectly it&#39;s a fat pitch down the middle and you knock it out of the park

      "turnaround situations Baba is one it and the CFO said quote your second question is about free cash flow as I explained there's quite a big significant drop of free cash flow one of the reasons is the significant increase in expenditure AI Investments uh the other reason is because of sort of the working capital changes in relation to some of the business scale jobs what they did which also hurt the tbow t-all was they're reducing that um direct sales business I don't know if you're familiar with but that was down material they're proactively doing that because I guess it was low margin and he goes if you look at the business scale jobs many of them the majority are from those plan scale down as if you like as I was explaining why our direct sales business within tawau and t-ball dropped quite significantly the reason is we proactively scaled some of these onep business in T tbal and t-all we believe in some of these business categories onep format probably not a more efficient format so that sort of practice but if you uh but you will also have some of the business scale job was not proactively did that some of that overall Market situation the revenue dropped for example from SAA like in time all those businesses are one p and the job of their SC actually impacts working capital uh I don't know I can probably give you a bit more color on because one p on the other hand you're buying inventory from a vendor on the other hand you sell it and does the vendor normally give you a credit term like 60 days or 90 days if you can make your money your inventory turn over I.E sell inventory within a short period of time shorter than the short-term credit you're given actually you are generating cash flow particularly if the size is going up you're generating positive cash flow so on the contrary if you're reducing scale in this case on purpose uh it will have outflow on the working capital but is that a permanent impact he's he's asking a rhetorical question and he says to me I think that is relatively temporary impact so this process of reducing sale in that direct sales business uh we see this type of outfly outflow but when the business becomes stable we will no no longer see these types of outflows so for everyone worried about free cash flow and is the business deteriorating it's not it's one it's proactive decision on on uh investment and number two taking down this business this undesirable business the direct sales business for them is impacting working capital which is what is is impacting free cash flow and you can see that partially evidenced in cash from operations still being $4.6 billion and then buying back $5.8 billion uh of stock um so I I think that's kind of the the key highlights good to see the AI revenues up 200% uh it's good to get that explanation and then Eddie woo the CEO uh proclaimed that they're going to return to double digit Revenue growth in the second half of the fiscal year with gradual acceleration thereafter that's huge because no one is predicting that China GDP is going to go up to 8% or 9% so he's saying we're going to go from underperforming GDP in tbal and t-all to dramatically outperforming uh GDP as as the the monster player um and then the final thing I'd say two things that I liked about getting the cash under control first thing was this was a real pet PE mine so they bought $5.8 billion a stock but it was a net reduction of 2.3% of the share count uh because they've been doing a lot of employe stock options uh uh Employee Stock plan and which you said when meeting with these people people they were really motivated to get the stock price up because they all have a ton of stock what I'm glad about is that starting last last quarter they started to replace a portion of alibaba's uh ESOP incentives with long-term cash incentives for our employees starting last quarter these cash incentives will be reflected as cost and this is huge as an owner they going to be less shares less slices of the pie given out and they'll have that cash restricted over time cash is one time pay slice of the pie is a forever pay which as an owner I'm I'm less inclined and then",

      "here is to go into alibaba&#39;s most recent earnings because what is going to be the driver because really honestly the F like if if China all the sudden wanted to get massive Equity inflows probably the number thing number one thing that they could do is buy Alibaba shares and drive the price up 50% because then all the indices would go up and then opinion follows Trend and all the pensions would be like you&#39;re under performing because you have no China exposure and it would just be like the oil thing in 2000 I&#39;m not saying they&#39;re going to do that like the Japan these did but they are in the market buying some equities leaving that aside let let&#39;s talk realistically about the the the pluses and minuses because to some degree the health of China equities is dependent on Alibaba because that&#39;s what westerners know yes you have 10 cent speaking about outs we had the cloud we had the retail even fres shippo that thing could become the Costco of China I mean it&#39;s not there yet it&#39;s a couple billion dollar business but um um so so we talked about the the new buyers coming in they also announced something called they&#39;re going to copy 10 cent and Pino duo in doing the six uh 610 of 1% service software uh software service fee on all transactions I did a back of the napkin uh a math on that revenues last year for tbow and t-all were 57 billion so 60 bips on that is 342 million to the bottom line alone that starts in September which about 14 cents a share give or take it&#39;s not huge but but it increases the profitability increases the free cash flow now if they can buyb stocks through the southbound connect and not have to issue converts to buyback stocks that that could that could be a factor but you know revenues were anemic look GDP 5% they only did 4% revenues that&#39;s that&#39;s not great uh but Cloud business revenues finally",
      "the toll taker for consumption in China uh I know Alibaba is one of your top positions in your fund uh a how can they get your ETF and and B how would that give them broad diversification to to when we do get that uh abrupt move in in the right direction and then opinion starts to follow Trend and and they all go up in concert effectively yeah yeah I mean it&#39;ll be um you know again I think I think one of the interesting things you know um my background kind of on the index methodology side is at the end of this month is msci&#39;s quarterly rebalance and because India&#39;s outperformed China by so much within the EM Benchmark that India will be about 20% of the EM index and China will be about 24% China was closing in on 50% of the index uh preco so so one you&#39;d said this you this incredible Fall From Grace but but mathematically if you think about India at 20% China at 24 well India&#39;s GDP is three and a half trillion and China&#39;s 18 trillion does that make sense to you so so the indices themselves have a little bit of this momentum effect and you know I think I think the you know when you have very you know sector concentration um sometimes that&#39;s ringing the bell and you you saw that in the US a few years ago where you know the energy stocks were yeah you know basically kicked out of all the indices and you know then you know energy had so so I think I think there&#39;s an opportunity for China at this point and I think this index rebalance maybe you know is the ringing the bell at the top on on on the India trade and maybe you know may maybe ringing the bottom for China because you have some of these positive in terms of Economic Policy uh but also just the incredible valuation of these companies including Ali me one time you know stat that that we didn&#39;t and I always love to share that I think you you and your your shareholders would love is that Al Alibaba has very little debt but they do have a few US dollar bonds and and they have a bond that comes due in 2031 and and obviously interest rates have been rising here in the US the last few years so that Bond&#39;s lost about six% uh in US investment grade corporates have lost 7% over the last three years but would you believe that bond is down 6% and alibaba&#39;s stock is down 66 yeah this up by the way it&#39;s almost like in the US when a company gets kicked out of the Dow they tend to outperform over the next 12 to 24 months um it&#39;s funny that you brought up the energy trade because that&#39;s kind of what put my podcast on the map during covid um and uh and we had a huge run because we were buying xon the highest quality in the most dislocated circumstance when when oil turned negative and it was like I think the waiting got down to 2.5% from a peak of 10% and was the exact same thing pensions can&#39;t buy it anymore ESG you can&#39;t own it blah blah blah until the price went up and then opinion followed Trend and now these pensions can&#39;t get enough energy stocks so um it it history really does Rhyme it it it it often repeats and that&#39;s why I continue to emphasize that scenario in 2001 to 2007 because the abrupt move that we&#39;ve had in tech stocks in China uh was very much like that period and then you had the the strengthen dollar go to the weaking dollar I do want to shift gear by the way so Alibaba in in terms of the China Tech index that that&#39;s one of your top couple Holdings what percentage weight is that in the kweb it&#39;s almost 10% wow so that&#39;s that&#39;s a huge position how many Holdings do you have overall we&#39;ve got 32 um you know we do cap of the largest holding at 10% okay that you know you know exchange traded funds are 40 act mutual fund so the Investment Company act 194 so so there are diversification rules we have to abide by y um and and we rebalance semiannually so as stocks go up and down you know you can have movement there but uh yeah I mean we we were very early you know we bought shortly after the IPO that&#39;s kind of what helped put us on the map was uh we were the kind of the first ETF to own Alibaba because we had this kind of FastTrack inclusion",
      "country and Company risk at the same time it&#39;s part of the reason we&#39;ve expressed um our um our position through Alibaba and I want to talk about the earnings here first and foremost we have uh something coming up in August 22nd where we&#39;re going to have the vote to have the Dual primary listing uh and then if that&#39;s approved which it appears that it will then September 9th we go live uh in Hong Kong supposedly so it&#39;s estimated if you look at 10 cent if you look at uh Alibaba if you look at mwan mwan when it when it did the Dual primary listing in 2019 it was up 17% in the first month some of the others not as much because they were in Weak markets uh it&#39;s expected that up to 10 to 15% of the market cap could come from China buyers over time so you&#39;re looking at 20 to30 billion dollars of buying power coming in over the next 9 to 12 months uh can you speak to that and the implications you think that might have yeah yeah I think this is um you this is this is a big Catalyst for the company that&#39;s southbound uh stock connect is a program there&#39;s Northbound which allows foreign investors like like you know at at crane shares we do invest not in KW but in other strategies in the Chinese a share market and allows a foreign investor to go through the Hong Kong Stock Exchange and by Shanghai shenzen stocks and the reverse is true with southbound stock connect which allows institutional and uh High net worth investors in China to invest in Hong Kong stocks but it&#39;s not all Hong Kong stocks that have to be Hong Kong eligible and one of the requirement there&#39;s there&#39;s been various requirements um and you some of those rules have changed over time relaxed um but if you&#39;re primary listed outside of Hong Kong you you&#39;re not connect eligible okay and so Alibaba the shareholders will vote you know to make its dual primary which would make it um southbound connect eligible and I&#39;ve actually been I&#39;ve I&#39;ve made some phone calls um you know you know between us to Alibaba to the Hong Kong stock what is the exact date and and and I think people being very Koy on what is the exact date so I you know the the September 9th you know you know we&#39;ve talked about and and you know I&#39;ve seen some people kind of backtracking you know some people saying hey maybe that you know maybe it could be sooner you know maybe it&#39;ll be a little later so so but but but the key is it&#39;s coming and just to your point time you know you know how do we know what&#39;s coming well you know we did some comparisons you know you know 10 cent which um has about about a billion user just over a billion users of we chat uh it&#39;s you know China&#39;s Facebook and you know Alibaba the two main Ecommerce uh Tau and Teo have about 900 million users uh so you could say well what are the number of users or we could look at the number of shares or the percentage of market cap so about 10% % of 10 cents call it 400 billion in market cap is held so so you&#39;d say okay about 40 billion could go into Alibaba um but you could say well alibaba&#39;s you know only about 200 billion so 10% you know so so you know we don&#39;t we don&#39;t know exactly how much will come in it won&#39;t come in day one but you&#39;re talking about 20 to 40 billion yeah uh coming in I mean I mean this is a real number I mean this is a real real Catalyst and um you know you know I kind of D say like you know imagine not being own able to own Amazon yeah uh you know you use it every day and know you know you&#39;re you know I you know it&#39;s like you&#39;re gonna go Coco for Cocoa Puffs like you&#39;re GNA say I can buy the you know",

      "senior person at 10 cent but but you know it speaks to what what's coming for Alibaba and so Alibaba you know in when the when the domestic consumtion piie was just growing growing growing when you've got new newer competitors like pind duo duo or jd.com which historically has been willing to really drop their margins to Discount y you've got uh bite dance Tik Tock in China so so part of the issue for for alib is when the pi stopped growing yeah started materially losing some market share so so my hope you know our you know our belief is that as the pie starts growing again it helps insulate Alibaba besides the moves they're making to to head off some of these competitive threats at the same time I do agree Tom that part of what gets us excited about this is the growth in Cloud um the non-china Ecommerce business you know which grew 32% um and then you've got their Logistics business is doing great grew 16% so that's where you know the aggregate revenue for the company grew 6% even though that that Commerce is becoming they're becoming less dependent on over time um has had some challenges so so so you know we kind of Envision that the other parts of the business start taking up more of the slack and and certainly Alibaba is benefiting from you know kind of policies that the Chinese government has implemented in Southeast Asia in Africa in the Middle East in terms of building relationships this kind of belt and road yeah you China is a benef you know you know Alibaba is a beneficiary of that I mean there's you know so that you know as these governments do more you know the the President of Vietnam is in China today like you know do you think alibaba's benefits from that you bet you know not not through subsidies or anything it's just more of you know as these countries do trade deals you know it opens up the way for Al you know Alibaba doing incredible business in Turkey getting into Europe anyway so so yeah it's it's actually you know it's almost the irony of some of the Tariff talk where man don't you see how inflationary that is for the US consumers and here's where you can point to um you know trying to exports deflation and you know anyway so there's others elements of the business that has have us excited they just historically been really overshadowed by this core eccommerce but but we are more constructive going forward yeah all BuyBacks and dividends yeah yeah and and I think as it's interesting it's like the chip bans were the worst thing that we could do from a national security standpoint because what we have ultimately forced the Chinese to do is create competency themselves and all that means is",
      "margins and then you see storage capacity in exabytes the demand is greater than the supply the same is going to be true for Alibaba in Asia uh TSX for the Canadians the Looney is picking up pace as we&#39;ve talked about but the TSX trades at a record discount to the S&P 500 not seen since 2001 I&#39;d be looking for Canadian stocks I think some of the uh materials plays and some of the energy plays are going to start to be home runs there so got to start to look at some the Canadian stuff uh TSX is",
      "I think great companies in China including Alibaba they're putting their wallet where their mouth is. If these Tech entrepreneurs are buying back stock that probably means China's economy is not about to go off a cliff that they see something and they're doing something about it and the question is like what are we as investors doing when we see that and I'd say like listen this stuff is volatile. David Tepper just wrote a billion dollar check to buy some Alibaba in the last quarter. What I love about that is what I wish we saw more with American companies when American company stock craters management don't buy in stock the way that they do in China and I love the fact that the Chinese have the right mindset that when the price goes down and you believe in your prospects that's when you load the boat and you buy all the stock you don't crawl under the desk and I think that's going to serve us as owners very very well that they were reducing the float and in Baba's case now even doing it more aggressively and saying you guys have enough pieces of the pie we're going to give you cash bonuses and we're going to let the owners take the ride with us so get in get on before we take off and at year end I think Joe Sai and Jack Ma who's retired from the took big purchase."
