Welcome to Hedge Fund Tips with Tom Hayes. I'm Tom Hayes and this is your 310th videocast podcast for the week ending September 24th, 2025. Got a lot of incredible stuff to cover today. Lot of data, lot of media, but as always, family first. Although this week, uh not much news on the family front because season is just kicking off. We got some incredible goals that we'll share with you next week. So, I'll just go through my New York trip here. Uh that's at Yahoo Finance. There's Julie Heyman in the background who interviewed me. Was great. Here's a little background of the studio for the newer viewers who haven't seen this stuff yet. That's in front of Fox uh News Corporation building on 6th Avenue. Then I got to play Piping Rock yesterday in on the Northshore in Long Island. Uh that's where the uh the setting of The Great Gatsby. Uh thanks to Tim and Tom and Brian for being such incredible hosts. You can see the clubhouse there in the back. What an incredibly amazing course. Um I I broke 90, which they said was a huge accomplishment, but not by much. Uh and I I think the next go at that that track I'd hit a I'd probably have an 84, but not much better than that. That was a tough track. Had some good shots, dropped some putts, and and still uh just one of the most beautiful courses I've played. Top 100. I think it's in the top 50 actually in the country. Uh just gorgeous. It's like u it's just this little bubble in the middle of nowhere. And if you ever get a chance to play, do it. Here is the New York Stock Exchange. Um okay, where is the thing that moves the pictures? Let me start here. There we go. All right. some New York Stock Exchange pictures right in front of the building. Pretty wild. The This is UN Week. So, I I actually had to take the subway a bunch of places. You can't even get around in a car. It took me 30 minutes to go five blocks the yesterday when Trump was in town. So, uh that's with Diane King Hall on the New York Stock Exchange, Schwab Network. Um that was with Ashley over at NYSC Live. That's the booth. There's Ashley. Uh this was on the Big Money Show just now. That's why I'm in a tie. Same tie, same shirt. Um, that's with Brian Dan. Shows you some of the teleprompterss, etc. So, a lot of fun here in New York. First, I want to thank Liz Clayman and Brooke Haliscak along with Jake Mack for having me on Fox Business, the Clayman Countdown on Monday. We talked Baba, we talked some covert AI plays and a lot more. We're going to listen in here. Even as a deal for Tik Tok solidifies, the US and China have not yet come to solid terms on tariff rates. But don't tell that to Chinese stocks. This entire year, as the US and China circle each other in this trade negotiation ring, ready to throw a punch or shake hands at any given moment, Chinese equities have soared. I mean, if you look here, BYD, the electric vehicle company, up 33 plus% year to date. You've got 10 cent up 55, call it 56%. and Alibaba up 93% this year, but just a month ago was 36% cheaper, which was precisely when our floor show guest appeared on the show and told you to buy it. That would be Tom Hayes, chairman of Great Hill Capital. Uh Ed, great to have you, Tom. Um so much. >> Well, what did you see then that kind of told you that that could be the case? Well, Liz, we were on over a year ago telling people to buy it in the 80s and 90s, and everyone looked at us like we had three heads because China was uninvestable. All the sellside banks were downgrading China. Here's what we saw. We saw $80 billion of cash on the balance sheet. We saw $25 billion of free cash flow. We saw a toll taker on the Chinese middle class recovery. We saw the number one cheapest AI play in the world. Not only do they provide the compute power, have 40% of the market, uh, but they have stakes in every single AI company in China. When they say we need compute power, they say that's fine, just give us equity. So, uh, Alibaba was the cheapest way to play AI around the world. >> Plus, Alibaba has come out with its own chatbot that seems to be very successful. That brings me back to the tech story today. Nvidia Open AI. I mean, this is a massive, massive deal that could involve the need for millions of NVIDIA chips. >> It's insane. I mean, a 10 gawatt deal. The AI industry is writing checks that the energy industry can't cash. Okay, 10 gawatt is enough to power 7.5 million homes. That's the amount of energy that's going to be required. So we start to look at what are the derivative ways to play the demand for energy that's going to be fueled by these type of type of projects. Uh you know to put it in uh another perspective 10 gawatt 45,000 football fields of solar panels to power 10 gawatt. So the the the unending demand data center demand is going to go up 165% by 2030. 60% of that is going to be powered by natural gas. So, what's the the covert play if if you will when it comes to energy? >> Well, first thing, uh, energy right now is the cheapest sector in the S&P 500. It's trading at 15.2 times earnings. What most people don't know is that they're going to have among the highest earnings growth next quarter, next year, 17% earnings growth. We love Commtock Resources, biggest player in the Hannesville shale. Uh, and they're close to all the export term terminals and the liquidification terminals. Jerry Jones owns 75% of this stock. >> Jerry Jones of the Cowboys. >> Yeah. Trading at book value, proven reserve, 10-year reserves, about 5.7 billion. The problem is they have 30 years of unproved reserves. This could be a $45 stock from 16 over the next three years. >> Okay? And the and what I check these things because I don't want our viewers buying at the top, but Trump stock is actually down 38% quarter to date. So, at least they wouldn't be buying it at the very richest part of the curve. No, you're buying it at liquidation value effectively right now. So, so as they start to benefit from all these years of unproved reserves, which they don't have to report, they only have to report PV10. Uh that value will be realized in coming years. >> Why do you suppose energy has the lowest forward 12-month PE of any of the sectors considering this has been a story we've been talking about for months now? The energy needs are absolutely incredible. I mean, we have the nuclear companies that are coming out big when it comes to nuclear energy. In fact, we're going to take you live coming up. Uh Max Gordon, our reporter, is at a brand new Oaklo one. And so, you know, why why is it still so cheap? >> Liz, we're back to the future. You may not remember this, but I remember it like yesterday. I was on your show in 2020 during COVID remote and uh the weight of the energy sector went down to a historic low of 3%. >> Oh, I remember oil went negative. Oil went negative and I was pounding the table to buy Exon Mobile at $33. Okay. This is the first time since 2020 that the energy sector is down to 3% waiting in the S&P 500. Every time you've taken a bid when it's that forgotten, you've made tremendous amounts of money over the next 12 to 18 months and we're moving into a seasonally strong period for energy stocks. >> Yeah. For those of you who are saying could, would a, shoulda, Exon Mobile right now at $112 a share. Let me shift it to what should be given a lot of credit for the records that we are seeing right now for the Dow, NASDAQ and S&P and that is a quarter point cut last week by the Federal Reserve. You got a whole host of Fed heads who are speaking today. Yeah. >> Bunch of them including Steven Myron who was the one descent. He felt it shouldn't be a quarter point cut. It should be a 50 basis point cut. What do you think that that says to the psychology of the markets? This is very constructive because historically when you're cutting into an expansion and we're showing no signs of recession, a little weakness in the labor market, but GDP growth is still positive. Uh four cuts to five cuts that on average the market's up 16.1% 12 months later. >> 12 months after >> 12 months after. So this is very very very constructive tailwind. We also have consumer sentiment that's washed out to the to the uh greatest extremes since 2020 and since the great financial crisis 12 months later in those extremes consumer sentiment washed out S&P up 26.1% on average. So there are a lot of tailwinds here but we do have sell rush rush hosana by Yam Kapor end of end of September tends to be a little bit weak. Uh so we'll see what happens in coming days. If you get some bumps don't worry it's just seasonal. Yeah, for those of you who don't know, that's an old that's an old saying down on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange. >> On average, S&P down.5% during that period, right? >> The Jewish new year, of course, >> 66% of the time. >> Okay. Yeah. >> Happy New Year to our Jewish Exactly. Tom, good to see you. Thank you very much. All right. One of the world's biggest sportsware makers. >> And we're back. And then I had the pleasure to join also uh not only the great Liz Clayman, the great Stu Vanney for the full hour as company. Uh we talked all different subjects. Really enjoyed that as well. Thanks to Payton Jennings and Christian Dagger and the great Stu Vney for having me on. We'll listen in here. >> You know this that is Taylor Swift. I know. I can tell. And I there's a fine choice of a song. bad blood. That refers directly to Carla Harris's book, which we are going to get into shortly. But we're going to start this morning with a look at the state of the stock market rally because we have clearly been in rally mode for some time. Futures right now presents something of a mixed picture. Dow up 50, NASDAQ up just four. Tom Hayes here in New York for us. All the indicators closed at record highs yesterday. Um, we've been saying that a lot this year. Record highs here and there and everywhere. Is there much room left for this rally? >> I think the market, the S&P 500 could push up another 5% to 7,000, not in a straight line and not overnight, over the next 6 months. And and there are a few tailwinds for this. First of all, you've got the Fed, okay? Anytime the Fed has restarted an easing cycle and you get four cuts over the next 12 months like like is priced in right now, we've got four to five cuts priced in, the S&P is up 16.1% on average. The second thing we've got is cons. >> Can I just stop you there for a second? >> Yeah, of course. >> Historically, as soon as the Fed starts a series of rate cuts, and you know it's a series of rate cuts, S&P goes up 16%. >> 16.1% on average 12 months out. >> Okay. I'm sorry I interrupted you. What else you got? >> Then you got earnings power, 13.7% earnings growth. We're at an extended multiple here, 22.5. So we could get some bumpiness. Usually you have this week sell rush hosana buy yam kapor is a weak period where you're supposed to go down about a half a percent in the S&P 500. We're not seeing that yet. So this might be an exception once again. Maybe we got all the corrections in April. Uh and then finally consumer sentiment is completely washed out. We're at levels not seen since the COVID lows, the uh European debt crisis lows in 2011 and in 2008 the great financial crisis lows. What happens next? Yeah. S&P up 24.1% in the following 12 months. So I think as >> when consumer confidence comes all the way down >> Yeah. >> the S&P goes up. >> Yeah. Cuz it can't get any worse. So So it starts >> it starts to discount. And I think a huge function of this is you've got $35 trillion of home equity trapped. Now that rates are coming down. You're going to see the heliloc game come back on. Consumers are going to have more money to refinance to get back in the market. the the house US household is so underlevered right now. Their balance sheets are very very healthy. They just can't get that equity out cuz rates are too high. And that's going to change. >> On the issue of rates, I want you to listen to what newly minted Federal Reserve Board guy Steven Meer had to say about interest rates. Watch this. >> Including the inflation and output channels along with the median model implied RSTAR, the Fed funds rate should be around 2 to 2 and 1/4% under the standard Taylor rule. The balanced approach implies a rate of around 1 and a half to 2%. If we instead use the market implied RSAR, these numbers would all be one full point higher. The upshot is that monetary policies well into restrictive territory. Leaving short-term interest rates roughly two percentage points too tight risk unnecessary layoffs and higher unemployment. >> Okay, Tom, that is very technical stuff. >> Yes. >> Cut through it and you see that he's calling for sharply lower interest rates. Now, does this guy have much influence on the board? >> He will have influence as far as shaping the narrative. And he's absolutely right because what Powell is doing, it's a frog in a pot. You're turning up the heat. And you don't notice how restrictive it is until the layoffs start. And once they start, it's very, very quick. So, uh, what Mirren is doing here is getting ahead of the curve. He's absolutely right. We should be 200 basis points lower. That will unlock housing. That will unlock tons of jobs. Housing is 16% of GDP. Unlock the consumer and let animal spirits roar. >> Okay, we hear you. Now, you're gonna stay with me for the hour. I want some more of that. Thanks very much. >> Look, California's bullet train got four billion in federal funding. 2.4 billion of that is now being redirected under this new program. Um, that highspeed rail was approved. It's amazing. Seven 17 years ago, and now billions of dollars later, not not a single track has been laid, right? and the initial cost has skyrocketed to like $130 billion. >> Newsome's not going to be pleased with the feds taking 2 whatever it is billion dollars off him. Tom, you are a California guy. >> Yeah. >> Am I right in saying that that high-speed bullet train, whatever you want to call it, is toast. >> It's absolutely toast. Uh in markets and elsewhere, money goes where it's treated best. Money was absolutely incinerated in this project. Now it's going for safety. Intercity trains. Uh the number one job of a president is to keep his people safe. This money is being redirected towards safety. It's being >> what what what do the people of California think about this? This thing is over hundred billion dollars in total cost. It's not going to be built. Is is there no political comeback against Newsome for this? >> Yeah, there's no question. I mean, we've got the among the highest taxes in the country. We've got a project that's completely failed. We've got feckless leadership that hasn't worked. This is just one more example. And we want that money invested in our schools, in our safety, in our kids, and not in uh uh you know, railways to nowhere. >> 20 seconds. Can you see the day coming when a Republican could win a statewide election in California? >> Yes, but it would have to be an actor. That's the only Republican that can get elected in the state of California would be an actor. And there are some in queue. Uh we will see to be continued. >> Yes. You're here with for the hour, so maybe reveal some names later. Yeah. All right, Tom, thanks very much. Indeed, another stock that's been all over the place, but sharply higher recently. That's Core Weeave. Who's bullish on them? >> A pair of upgrades, Wells Fargo, they go to Overweight, $170 price target. Melas goes to a buy. Um they IPOed at $40 at the start of the year, but Cororeweave is in a deal with Nvidia uh to sell Nvidia any cloud cap capacity that they haven't already already sold. So, it's like this AI spending just keeps going around and around and around and these are all the beneficiaries and they might be down one day, but they're all big up big time in a over a longer period. >> All right, Tom, hold on a second. Coreweave IPOs at 40. Y >> it rapidly goes to 190. Yeah. >> Then it rapidly comes down to I think 88 was the low. Yeah. >> Now it's 134. Where would you buy this thing? >> It's the Wall Street fashion show. Okay. This is the flavor of the month. it it it'll trade at many many multiples of sales before it has profitability. This is not what we do for a living. Uh we'll leave it to other people. It can run more. But you know, if if these companies miss by one or 2%, the stock's not down 1 or 2%. The stock's down 40 or 50%. So for us with our clients money, we want to bet on things which a sure bet. We sleep well at night, get them at good prices, generate free cash flow, don't have to think about it. But there are many people that play this game and do quite well. Mike Lee is one of them. That was a fine commercial there for both yourself and Mike Lick. All right, let's have a look at that. Dow's up 120. Tom, you brought with you some stock picks. I'm looking at the prompter and I see you're back to Intel. >> No, wait a second. Kudos to you. You're the guy who recommended Intel at like 18 or 19. It went out on a limb. Now it's 2930. Where's it going? >> It's going higher because the Nvidias of the world, the designers, rely on the kindness of strangers for the success of their business. And right now the only game in town is Taiwan Semiconductor for Nvidia to get their chips. And Taiwan Semiconductor has capped their growth at $4 billion per quarter. So this investment into Intel of only 5 billion. It starts with CPUs. It will go to GPUs. And if you think President Trump is selling Boeing planes, wait till you see how many Intel chips he's going to sell now that we the taxpayer own $9 billion worth of stock. >> That's right. We take a piece of the action. That's right. It's transactional president. That's what it is. Comtock Resources. What do they do and why do you like them? >> Okay, this is a natural gas play. Data center demand up 165% through 2030. 60% of that will be powered by natural gas. Comtock Resources owns 75% by Jerry Jones of the Dallas Cowboys. We want to be an investor with him. He's an oil and gas wildcatter. 1.1 acres. Hannesville. Close to the export terminals. Close to the liqufification terminals in the Gulf of Gulf of Mexico. close to data center uh where they're putting all the data centers. So, this is going to be a great play. It's trading at liquidation value. This thing could go from 16 to 45 over the next 3 to 5 years. >> It's going up as you speak. You have market impact. All right. Thanks very much indeed, Tom. Tom is still with me. Uh give me an idea how massive that project is. >> It's huge. 10 gawatt. You know, the AI industry needs energy like a diabetic needs insulin. Okay, this is absolutely huge. 10 gawatts to put in perspective would be 45,000 football fields worth of solar panels. We're not going to get there with solar. We're going to get there with natural gas. We're going to get there with energy. It's so interesting. Energy right now is the lowest weight of the S&P 500. Since the COVID lows when energy traded negative, this is a generational opportunity. Everyone's chasing coreweave and chasing chips. The play is going to be energy and it's going to be US energy which doveetales with President Trump drill baby drill policy. Okay, you got me. Thanks. >> And we're back. And then uh I spoke to Julie Hyman of Yahoo Finance. Thanks to Justin Oliver for having me on. Covered all different uh uh subjects. We're going to listen in here. >> Let's talk macro for a moment in this little bit of a pause here this morning, but we have had this big upsurge. >> Yeah. >> Anything? You've been pretty bullish. >> I have been bullish. Uh and that's worked, but I I do think we could be due for a pause. There's an old Wall Street maxim you've been around sell rush hoszana buy yam kapor right and you know more than twothirds of the time this uh last week week and a half of September tends to be a weak time on average uh down about uh point4% in the S&P 500.5% in the Dow Jones Industrial I think that's the bad news Julie so maybe a little short-term volatility the good news you got so many tailwinds number one you got consumer sentiment completely washed out at levels not seen since the COVID lows and prior to that the European debt uh crisis in 2011 and the great financial crisis in 2008. What happened 12 months later when consumer sentiment was this low and washed out? S&P was up 24.1%. Uh the other thing you have as we know now is the tailwinds of the Fed cuts and if you know right now markets expecting four to five cuts over the next 12 months uh in an expansion if we don't go into recession we're showing no signs of immediate recession. GDP is still positive. You have up 16.1% over the next 12 months. And then you got earnings accelerating. So, uh, estimates for next year, 13.7% earnings growth, up from $300 a share to $35 a share. Uh, so I think the theme is going to be pick your spots because maybe the indices don't do quite as well prospectively as they've done in the rearview mirror the last few months. Uh, but under the surface, some tremendous opportunity. >> Okay, where's the spot? Okay. Well, first thing, we've got a four times in a 100redyear opportunity in small caps. Small caps valuation relative to large caps has only been this low. This will be the fourth time in a 100red years. Okay. Uh last time was the early 2000s. Over the next six years, you had dramatic outperformance. Uh Fed cuts are a huge catalyst for this because they can refinance their debt. They have faster earnings growth relative to the S&P. They have a lower multiple relative to the S&P. So, I know a lot of value guys and girls have been calling for small caps for >> Oh, really? I haven't noticed, Tom. I don't know what you're talking about. >> But for all of our technicians out there, they're actually starting to break out. Not that the fundament fundamentalists really care, but it's a good sign. They are starting to break out. And now we finally have that Fed. >> Okay. I'm going to ask you the same thing I asked one of your peers on the street who was also talking about small caps last week. Um, I just for fun went back and looked at the relative performance of small caps versus large caps. >> Yes. >> 10-year period, 20-year period, 30-year period, 40-year period. >> Yeah. >> Guess what outperformed at all of those periods of time? Large caps. So, is it is it, you know, is it small caps over large caps or is it just I mean, it's not like you're selling your your large caps. No, no. You know what I mean? >> Well, it it's cyclical. I if you look at small cap value over the last 40 years dramatic outperformance over large cap it depends on the start period and the end period particularly if you look at when periods get flushed out like this >> and I guess the the sub the subp part of >> small cap as well isn't >> profitable yeah profitable dramatically outperforms uh unprofitable and you have solveny risk obviously in some of that index but if we look perspectively earnings growth expected to be something like 30 35% next year relative to the S&P at 13.7 7 S&P trades at 22.5 times forward which is a little bit stretched small caps 18 17. >> So would you buy for example the S&P small cap 600 over the Russell because it tends to be more profitable or would you zero in on small cap value specifically? Like how are you thinking about it? >> Yeah, I I would be focused here just because of where we are with the easing cycle. I'd be actually skewed towards value uh because that's where you're going to get the cyclical upturn of of the uh acceleration that's driven by refinancing and and the earnings power. The other thing is energy. By the way, you can't give away energy right now. If you believe in data centers, this is the covert AI play. Uh you've got that sector is trading at the lowest multiple in the S&P 500 15.2 times. It's going to have the second highest earnings growth next year at 17.7% earnings growth. So you can >> even if oil prices remain suppressed >> just just on demand. Okay, there there is a case we're moving into the seasonal period where energy starts to outperform in the fourth quarter. Uh so I think you've got to have a little you know you haven't had the weight in the S&P this low in energy since the COVID lows when energy turned negative. It's only 3% of the S&P every time you've bought that. I mean, we were buying Exxon Mobile hand overfist at $33 when oil turned negative in 2020. We see some selective opportunities in energy just like that. That doesn't preclude tech being great, consumer discretionary, but it's like, you know, when when these things, generational opportunities are served up, you got to pay attention. >> Okay? And so, in our last 30 seconds, an individual one of those, >> Jerry Jones is linked to this one, which you got to love. >> Comtock resources. Uh, look, we full transparency, we built a position at $8 and $9 a share. It went to $28. Now it's at $16. New money coming in from clients. We are putting new money to work at these levels. >> So, what makes Yes. >> Okay. 1.1 million acres in the Hannesville, Bosian formations. This is Louisiana and Texas. It's near the export facilities. It's near the liqufification facilities. The demand for exporting LG is going to go up with the trade deals with with Europe. the demand in the data center. A lot of data centers are being built in those areas. You're going to have 165% growth in data centers by 2030. According to Goldman Sachs, 60% of that power is going to come from natural gas. They are the lowest cost producer. And you know, Jerry Jones is a master. He was a oil and gas wildcatter. That's what gave him the money to buy the Cowboys. Uh he's got 75%. He says his interest in natural gas is greater than his interest in the Cowboys. Wow. And um so so Comtock Resources is trading at 5 billion 5.7 billion market cap. That's PV that's the val that's it book value PV10 reserves. They've got 30 years of drilling rights which means this could be a $45 stock over the next few years. And we're back. Also got a chance to speak to uh who I always enjoy going to see Diane King Hall down at Schwab Network. We had an awesome interview. You definitely want to listen in here. markets and some AI stock picks. We want to bring in our next guest. We've got Tom Hayes, chairman and managing member at Great Hill Capital joining us. All right, Tom, thank you so much for joining us here at the stock exchange. It's always good to see you. Uh let's talk overall market. September uh hasn't it's a September to remember, but not for like the it's it felt like everyone was coming into this month with a bearish kind of tone and the expectation that oh, we were going to see a lot of bumps. But so far that really hasn't been the case. >> So far so good. I mean you know even this week you're supposed to sell Russana buy Yam Kapor S&P's down on average a half a%. Not the case. I mean even with Jay Powell out yesterday saying that the market's overvalued or warning about that. >> I think you got to really peel back the onion because when you say the the stock market is overvalued, you're basically saying the MAG 7 is overvalued because they're 40% of the weight of the S&P 500. Are small caps overvalued with 35% earnings growth next year trading at 17 times earnings? I don't think so. Is energy overvalued? Trading at 15.2 times earnings. Lowest weight in the S&P since the COVID lows. Huge buying opportunity in 2020. Huge buying opportunity now. Power the AI story, the covert AI play. The answer is no. They're going to have 17% earnings growth next year. So, I think we need to be nuanced here. If you're just going to go out and buy the indices uh and buy the Mag 7 and chase the things that have worked in the rearview mirror, I think Jay Powell is right. If you're going to be nuanced and look at the ketchup trade and the lagards, I think there's an enormous amount of opportunity. >> So, where do you see opportunity? >> Ah, good question. Well, I think you you got to pay attention to small caps. Number one, for the reasons I said, lowest multiple, highest earnings growth. You got to pay attention to earnings. If you believe in the AI uh energy, if you believe in the AI story, again, second highest earnings growth next year in the S&P 500. And this waiting in the S&P right now going back to 2020 levels. You remember when energy turned negative and they were paying you to take barrels of oil? >> We were pounding the table saying Exxon Mobile at $33. Well, there are opportunities right now in the natural gas space. >> Data center demand is going to grow 165% by 2030. According to Goldman Sachs, 60% of that is going to be powered by natural gas. >> A quick uh follow-up thought on small caps. >> There are many who talking about and advocating for the breakout here that we've been seeing honestly recently. The challenge though is you know when you look down the spectrum I mean some are just not profitable. Correct. So >> um so that's a challenge that you have to take into consideration. Right. >> Yeah. If you bifurcate between profitable and unprofitable, obviously the profitable dramatically outperformed, but all the conditions are set for those periods like the early 2000s when small caps dramatically outperformed. Those conditions being rates are coming down so these businesses can refinance debt. The problem with small caps is always solveny risk. You refinance the debt, you invest in property, plant, and equipment and we're off to the races. >> Okay. So, and we're off to the races. I want to go through a few names or a couple names that are on your list and plus we also have this news out on Alibaba. Let's start out with the Alibaba with uh the news that they're planning to increase uh their AI spending, right? They'd already talked earlier in the year about spending what would amount to the equivalent of around 50 billion, right? And now they haven't named an actual number, but it's going to be north of that, right? Um and then their CEO Eddie Woo saying that the projection for global uh spending investment in the space will be four trillion over the next 5 years. What's your take on Alibaba now? Because like you said about pounding the table. You pounded the table on that one before. >> Listen, this was the hardest position of all time. Look, we started buying this over $100. It dropped to $60. We pounded the table. Bye bye bye. While all the sell sides were saying China is uninvestable and all we saw was 25 billion of free cash flow, 80 billion on the balance sheet, number one uh China middle class e-commerce retailer, number one in cloud and cheapest way to play AI in the world. We brought our basis down to $82. It's $175 stock right now. It's going a lot higher. It's going a lot higher. This story hasn't even begun. They just launched Quen 3.0 O max, which is the large language model with 1 trillion parameters. I'm telling you, Alibaba is the cheapest way to play AI in the entire world. >> Okay, let me ask you this. So, given where it is and where it will open today? Um, >> do you expect it to double and then what kind of time frame or or are you I mean doubling might be a lot >> from from yesterday's uh price probably a double over the next three years. From today's price, less than a double. >> Okay. >> I mean, this thing has upside. >> Okay. All right. Let's talk about a couple other names on your list. You are you're liking Intel. Uh tell us about your views, your thesis there. >> Yeah, here's another uninvestable stock that we were on talking at $20, $19. No one wanted it. They said it was uninvestable. We said, listen, our downside's protected. If they liquidate the thing today, we get $22. And what if anything goes right? Well, guess what's gone right? US has has come in $9 billion back stop. You think President Trump is selling Boeing planes to all these countries around the world? Now that he owns $9 billion of stock or we own $9 billion of stock, he's going to be selling Intel chips. So this $5 billion from Nvidia, it starts with CPUs. It's going to lead to GPUs. Why? Not because Nvidia is doing charity work because Nvidia is capped at Taiwan Semiconductor $4 billion per quarter growth. They're not uh demand constrained. They're supply constraint. They need Intel to succeed. They need Intel's fabs to succeed with advanced chips so they can supply all the unlimited demand for this around the world. So Intel could be a multi multi-bagger from here and no one's paying attention to it. >> I wouldn't say no one's paying attention to it's up 50% now. Yes. Okay. But let let me ask you about one that I think is potentially one that no one's paying attention to. Comto stock is on your list. It is down more than 50% year to date and on a year-over-year basis, it's, you know, still down, but so where does it how why do you have conviction over this one? >> You're going to love this one. So, we started buying it at $8 and $9. No one wanted it. Went up to 28. Genius. >> Now, it's come down 50%. We still >> three bucks and change. >> No, no. Comoc resource CRK. It's >> CRK. Sorry, I'm looking at the wrong ticker, >> by the way. It's up on the year. So, it's $17 a share. Okay. Thank you for the question. That's okay because there's two tickers. I understand. No, not a big deal. Uh it's it's at $17 right now, which is trading about >> book value, which is PV10, proved reserves, $5.7 billion. The problem is they have 30 years worth of unproved reserves, which means this is going to be realized at about $4550 over the next 3 years. You got AI demand. You've got 1.1 million acres in the Hannesville shale in Louisiana and Texas. Close to the export terminals, close to the liqufification terminals. You're investing Perry Pu with Jerry Jones who made all his money in oil and gas to buy the Dallas Cowboys. And he says his holdings in natural gas are worth more than the Dallas Cowboys. This thing's going to be a multi-bagger. Covert way to play the AI boom. >> And again, I want to correct myself. Comm stock is slightly higher year to date up 3% and change and year-over-year it's actually much higher up more than 60%. So that's correction I had the wrong ticker there. Um all right Tom you you have some thoughts on the consumer. Um I mean listen you know they're still the backbone of the economy. Yeah. >> Um overall the consumer is still holding up but the job market is bumpy. >> Yeah it's interesting. I mean if you look at retail sales they're pretty good. If you look at consumer sentiment, we're at lows not seen since the co lows, not seen since the European debt crisis in 2011, not seen since the great financial crisis in 2008. So what happens after consumer sentiment gets this washed out? Well, on average, 12 months later, the S&P up is up 24.1%. Makes no sense. How can the market go up if the consumer is so pessimistic? Because it can't get any worse. The words are priced in. So here's what's going to happen. Rates are coming down. People have $35 trillion of equity trapped in their houses. They couldn't get out from HELOCs because uh Chairman Powell held rates artificially high, too restrictive for too long. That's changing. They're going to start to pull that out. That's going to go into the economy. Companies are going to refinance and hire. Consumers are going to take equity out and put it in the economy. They're going to refinance and get money back. They're going to be able to move for the first time and have job mobility because they're not stuck in by by such a low rate. uh and and housing is 16% of GDP. So housing has been frozen for two years. The game is going to be back on. A lot of good things happening in the economy. So on the basis of what earnings look like now, Jay Powell is correct about the S&P 500. It's fully valued at 22.5. On the basis of what's going to take place as rates come down and all these other industries start to participate bes besides seven stocks, >> early days. >> All right, we'll leave our conversation there. Great conversation as usual. That's Tom Hayes as chairman and a managing member of Great Hell Capital. >> And we're back. Then I had the pleasure then I had the pleasure of joining Ashley Mastinardi at the New York Stock Exchange. We'll listen in here. >> Joining me now is Tom Hayes. He is the chairman and managing member of Great Hill Capital. We have just about a minute before the bell, but what are you looking forward to in today's session, Tom? Yeah, I think uh Ashley, first of all, thanks for having me. I think the big story today is coming off of Chairman Powell's comments yesterday where he kind of alluded to the fact that he thinks the market is a bit fairly or fully valued or overvalued. Uh and the market didn't take well to that yesterday. Uh I I think what we have to look at here is what aspects of the market because if you just look at indices uh which is predominantly mag 7 weighted 22 and a half times earnings 13.7% earnings growth I think he's right I think if you look under the surface and you look at all the opportunities in small caps you look at value you look at healthcare some of the beaten down sectors healthcare energy uh international the opportunity is second to none you know just looking at today you saw Alibaba is up you know 8 9% pre-market they released a new AI large language model called Quen 3.0 Max with 1 trillion parameters. You know, chi international stocks have been outperforming the US 2 one, Chinese stocks 3:1. So, uh I I'm I'm interested to see the market's reaction on >> we're going to go to the bell now. We're going to talk more about that. Heat. Heat. The markets are officially open for trade. Rejoining me now is Tom Hayes. Tom, uh, let's get like a little bit deeper into that first point that you brought up. Fed chair Jerome Powell said uh stock prices are quote fairly highly valued. What are your thoughts on that assessment? >> Yeah, I think you know this rem this is reminiscent of Allen Greenspan in 1996 when he said irrational exuberance in the stock market. He was four years too early on calling the top. So I I think uh chairman Powell makes an important point about some of the stocks. So if you look at uh MAG 7 which is 40% of the weight of the S&P 500 they have decelerated their earnings growth from over 30% last year to about 10 or 15% this quarter uh half the earnings growth but the multiple has stayed elevated at 33 times earnings. So in those pockets where you have decelerating earnings and a a very high multiple a higher than market multiple I think he's absolutely right. I do think though as we look at rates coming down which is helping the cyclicals helping the unmagnificent 493 helping small caps small cap stocks right now are at a once in 25 year opportunity. So in the last 100 years this is the fourth time that small caps have traded at such a low valuation relative to large caps. Every time you bought the small cap index during these periods you had dramatic outperformance over the next 5 to 6 years. We saw the same thing from 2001 to 2006. So what are the conditions precedent that create the opportunity in small caps? Rates coming down into an expansion allows these companies to refinance debt because at the small cap level that is the biggest risk is solveny risk. So uh this is going to be a huge opportunity. Small caps 35% earnings growth next year 17 times multiple the exact opposite of the mag 7. So uh as he points to the indices he's right. as he points to under the surface. Uh there's there's a tremendous amount to do. >> And what's your take on the 25 basis point cut and what do you think is going to happen for the rest of the year? People are saying perhaps two more cuts before the end of the year and into 2026. >> Yeah, I think 25 basis points was too little. He's he's still 200 basis points too restrictive. The thing about the labor market, which he's now acknowledging, it's like boiling a frog in the pot. You don't feel it until you feel it all at once. Once layoffs start, they tend to cascade very aggressively. So, they need to get ahead of it. They need to get these next two cuts in. But what we found historically is when they cut four or five, they restart the easing cycle into expansion with four or five cuts over a 12-month period. On average, the market is up 16.1% S&P up over the next 12 months. So, I do think we have conditions precedent. I think President Trump might fi might find that too late Powell turns out to be just in time Powell if he gets the four to five cuts in and it's going to reacelerate the economy quickly. >> And you know it's hard to believe uh cuz Q2 earnings season just ended but there's another one Q3 earnings right around the corner. What are your expectations for it? >> Well, it's really interesting. Um expectations you usually expectations have come down into the quarter. Expectations are actually going up. Couple months ago 7.2% 2% earnings growth expected now $7.9% earnings growth. Same thing for next year. It went from $300 a share to $35 a share. So estimates going up. I think they're still conservative. I think we will beat. I think what people are going to be a little bit surprised by this quarter is if you look year for the growth rate of earnings for the Magnificent 7, they're going to be a lot more subdued because all that capex that's going into AI is impacting earnings, impacting their ability to buy back shares. So, I think that's going to be kind of the nuance. You have these uh unloved stocks that are now part of the catch-up trade that managers have to be in because they all sold in the hole in April and now they have to catch up to their benchmarks with performance. They're not going to do that in Mag 7, which have already had the run. They're going to do it in those stocks that are just getting going right now. Uh so, I think that's the one thing that I would be focused on. What does earnings growth look like with all the capex spending in the MAG 7? How does that affect the indices and where are the opportunities going forward? meaning those plays that will benefit from AI, not be the ones making all the investments in AI and compressing their margins. >> And I know you touched on small caps, and it seems like every expert that we have coming in is now talking about small caps. The Russell just hit a record. Um, what is your Do you think they're being overlooked? >> Yeah, I I do think they're being overlooked because people don't trust it. There have been a lot of false starts over the last few years. Uh, I think the only thing that could make them come out of the the penalty box was the uh the restart of the easing cycle. And now that we're seeing that, I think we're going to see a huge amount of growth. Look, the earnings don't lie. Earning 35% earnings growth at at a half uh half that multiple 17 18 times. You have to have some exposure and then they're bifurcated between those that have that are profitable and those that are unprofitable. Obviously, the profitable ones are dramatically outperforming, but uh but we're we're loading the boat in some of these stocks. Like for instance, a covert play that we have on AI is natural gas play called Commtock Resources. No one wanted to talk about this, you know, a year ago when we were buying at $89. Jerry Jones, uh uh who owns the Dallas Cowboys, he made all his money in energy to buy the Cowboys. Uh he owns 75% of the stock. They have 1.1 million acres in Louisiana and Texas near the export terminals, near the liqufification terminals. And if you believed Goldman Sachs that data center demand, data center growth demand is going to be 165% by 2030. And natural gas is going to power 60% of that, you definitely want to have exposure to natural gas and in the small and midcap sectors. >> And I understand that you are bullish on energy. Can you talk a little bit more about why? Yeah. So, the waiting of the energy sector in the S&P 500 is at historic lows. The last time it hit 3% where it is right now was in 2020 during the COVID lows when energy prices actually went negative. They were paying people to take barrels of oil in 2020 during co if you bought energy stocks during that period, you made a tremendous amount of money over the next 12 to 18 months. And now you have the AI tailwind coupled behind it along with uh uh the administration's favorable policies. >> All right, Tom Hayes, chairman of Great Hill Capital, thank you so much for joining us at the New York Stock Exchange. >> Thank you, Ashley. Thank them for including me in Reuters where I was talking about uh Powell quote the market was somewhat caught off guard by Powell stock market valuation comments and took that as a signal that perhaps the Fed could be concerned about elevated asset prices uh unquote uh new quote so many managers sold in April are still behind their benchmark so any weakness has to be bought and I think you're going to see more of that etc. Quote of the week. Long time Ben Gran taught me that price is what you pay. Value is what you get. Whether you're buying socks or stocks, I like buying quality merchandise when it's marked down. We have adopted Warren Buffett's philosophy with our own special turnaround Tom flavor, which is a lot more like what Warren Buffett did when he made his name when he was running the partnerships than when he had permanent insurance capital in the public vehicle. So, uh, we always add to that, um, short-term voting machine based on emotion, long-term weighing machine based on fundamentals. In the world of business, the people who are the most successful are those who are doing what they love. We couldn't agree more. Thank you all for sending in your pictures, getting your hats, t-shirts, mugs, and sharing the podcast and video cast with your friends and family. Uh, if you can uh become a client, great. If you can't become a client, great. All we ask is if you're getting value, share it with one person you love and care about who likes markets or invests uh their money. And uh and that will help this grow. And as long as we grow, we'll keep sharing it for free with non-clients. And uh and we've enjoyed doing that. And we hear so many people who come on uh as clients who were referred by other clients obviously, but more more often as well. um from friends who got them into the podcast and then became clients and then told them to become clients etc. So very grateful for that. Sloomer from RBC couple key charts you can see the S&P pausing at this level. Uh but uh extensions leading to 30 6940. We talked a little bit about that on Vney. 30-year yield tick back up counter trend bounce. I think it rolls back over. Uh utility sector starting to move up. And then this is the most important one I wanted to show you from Sloomer this week is the oil services index. We've been talking about this with National Oil Well, Varco, the oil sector in general, in the media appearances, etc. Of course, opinion follows th trend. Thanks to my buddy uh you know who you are, uh who sends me all this great stuff. Um guess what Bank of America, Meil Lynch had to do? They had to upgrade their price target. Why? Because Alibaba price blew through it at 175 today. Uh they were at 168. So they just took it up to 195. Opinion follows trend. Let's get to data. Dollar is having its worst year in decades. Everyone's surprised except for the loyal, incredible listeners of Hedge Fund Tips with Tom Hayes who were positioned for that going into the new year. Uh let's just see here. I think yeah, we got that one already. Uh, fund positioning, asset managers, hedge funds at every all-time high in the Russell 2000. Biggest short Russell position ever at an all-time high. Uh, net short. Everyone is net short and they're going to get their faces ripped in small caps. Intel is now outperforming every major AI name except for Oracle in 2025. Whose bingo card was that on? No one's except for the amazing listeners of Hedge Fund Tips with Tom Hayes. China huge move. Guess what? Still low multiple 13.7 times earnings compared to the S&P 500 at 22.7 and faster earnings growth in China. What else do you want to talk about? Here's the Vans collaboration with Valentino. sold out in every single sty style and size. Go on the website and see it for yourself. Uh onshore allocation and offshore allocation to China still nowhere near where it's going to be. Uh early days of this rally uh long short ratio against China. They're still short to death as China keeps going up. Now they have to chase in. You saw some big names uh yesterday buying Alibaba for the first time after it's after it's almost tripled off the lows. Now they're getting interested. Wait till you see all the people getting interested above 200. And again, all of the people who tried to get you out of your stock at $58 are going to be the same people that are trying to get you into the stock at $250. Mark my words. Same story all the time. S&P index around first cut following easing cycle pauses of six months or more. Here we are, ladies and gentlemen. So, yeah, you can get some short-term volatility, but the trend is up 12 months out on average up 16.1%. Household wealth up 6 trillion in 2025 so far. That's going to be unlocked with the lowering of rates, helocks, etc. We covered that on the big money show today. That will be part of next week's podcast. We don't have time to process that now. Weekly equity flows since 10:24 uh moving up. Opinion follows trends. EPS increases versus decreases. Earnings are going up not down. Rashana to Yam Kapor tends to be a weak week. Uh it's been kind of a choppy week. Um if you're in MAG 7, been a great week. By the way, the only sector that was up today was energy uh and staples, which we've been pounding the table on both. So the the tides are shifting. Are you ready? Our clients are, the listeners are uh in their own way and we're excited. Moving along, Russell 2000 uh hitting all-time highs. Russell 2000 IWM after four years. It's been n 969 days since the last all-time high. We did it. And if you go back, you got to go all the way back to 2010. And you saw what happened next straight up for many many years. Total return 12 months after first Fed cut. Let's take a look here. On average, financials do well, industrials do well, technology does well, discretionary does well, healthc care does well. We got to get more exposure to health care. Foreigners now own 18% of the US equity market, a record share. That's going to change as the dollar weakens. you're going to see more of that move back to international. How has Goldman Sachs Prime uh Prime Services hedge fund net leverage evolved? They've been short this whole rally up. Now they're starting to put leverage on lower rates boosting you US mortgage refinancing activity. You see it spike straight up in September early days. We continue to expect 25 basis points of cuts in October and December, followed by two more in 2026 to 3 to 325, which means your option arms are going to be foreign and change, which means the housing market supply is going to come on all at once and prices are actually going to go down. Gasparino, Charlie Gaspino was arguing against me on Big Money Show. Mark my words, you will see it. You're already seeing it in Florida. You're seeing it in some of the other states that boomed. You're going to see a lot more of it. affordability is coming to a theater near you or more affordable than today. Maybe not affordable but more affordable than today. Uh Fed funds forecast. Okay, we got that. NASDAQ put call ratio daily. That's interesting. There's so many puts and that's usually what you see near bottoms, not tops. That's an interesting chart. That's a little surprising and and nice to see. Emerging markets, tough decade, but something is stirring. It's going straight up. People are starting to get the memo. They'll figure it out in two years when we're up another 100%. Uh, since China intervened last year, Chinese equities have outperformed, by the way, by a metric of 3 to one. Not on anyone's bingo card, except the incredible listeners and clients. Uh, listeners of hedge fun tips, hedge fund tips with Tom Hayes, clients of Great Hill Capital, seven-year asset class, real return forecasts, uh, everyone. So what do they international deep value is expected to be the highest outperformer? We'll see. I mean this guy's talking his book GMO. I I tend to agree with him but you know I I disagree with his point point of view on US small cap. Nearly four years without a new high for small caps is over. What happens next year up 13.3% on average. I think that's a huge underestimation of what's going to take center. Power demand from AI centers to quadruple in 10 years. This is what I was talking about. Uh, by the way, 60% of that will be powered by natural gas. If you're not in comm stock, I'm sorry for you. And range resources, which has been a incredible one for us. Uh, price versus breath towards the end of overbought. I think what that certainly relates to mag 7. The rest uh here shows the small cap shorts. You can't make this stuff up. Absolutely shorting at the exact wrong time, which means we got the power to push higher. and the small caps. Uh let's see here. Average annualized total return performance by investment style for all months when US consumer confidence rises and declines 1960 to 2025 from one of the best in the business John Pollson formerly of Luthold Group. Uh and you see what happens when confidence start to rise off the lows. The biggest beneficiary is what is small cap. Russell, small cap 2000, how you doing? On to the next. Wow, Intel's up to 3150. How you doing? Um, you know, the calls I like best are all the clients calls saying how excited they are and how happy they are. The clients I like second best are all the people who didn't invest with me, who are now calling saying that I wish I had invested with you. And uh the answer is it's never too late because all the new money that's coming for this quarter, there's so much opportunity to put money to work right away. And we're deploying that slowly and we're going to deploy that aggressively in the next two weeks. Uh and uh and get them in the stocks that are just leaving the station versus the ones that are cruising at 30,000 ft. We're super excited for them. Um, rally in US stocks keeps eclipsing Wall Street expectations. Man, I go back to that April 7th call I did with clients. And really, hats off to all of you who sent in a lot of money and took advantage of this huge run. That was the the second time I've ever asked for money. The other time was October 2022. A lot of you took advantage and made a ton of money. So, kudos to you. Asian stocks beat US peers by most since 2017. Uh, bulls versus bears still neutral. There's still a lot of bears in the room, which, you know, that's a formula for the wall of worry. Wouldn't shock me to see a little bit of volatility and consolidation. But, um, when I look at an individual stock at the companies that we're underwriting, private equity and public markets, buying the whole business, uh, there's so much to do regardless of what the indices do. Uh that's just a mag seven game. We have zero exposure and um and we're happy about that and uh that's why we've been able to do what we've done. Uh average September tends to be weakened to the end. We'll see if we get that in in the last few days with Russoana Yam Kapor starting to see some call volume in the small caps. Finally sentiment is starting to turn. Obviously on the breakout earnings estimates continue to go up now up to 305. We started the year at 295 it went down to 290 now it's at 305. Small cap versus um small cap index. All right. Stocks overbought. not not showing extreme overbought here even in the S&P when it comes to breath that's from macro charts that's a pretty good indicator you get over this red line where you start to have more issues but um consumer staples to S&P haven't had an opportunity like this since 2000 this is critically important ladies and gentlemen do not miss what I'm telling you here most of the staples stocks are high dividend yielders or dividend growers no one wants them right now as rates come down there is going to be a rush for dividend yield because it's going to come out of money markets. And the last time you saw this was March 2000 when everyone said Warren Buffett had lost his touch because everyone was buying Global Crossing and uh Cisco and all these companies that got smashed 80% in the next few months and um no one wanted Staples and Buffett was buying up Staples over the next four years while everyone was down 80 90% getting blown up left and right. even some of the famous names who are now buying Baba up 3x. Um, uh, he was buying PNG, he was buying Disney, he was buying boring staples. In the next four years, he outperformed while everyone else was crashing. Even though the market went down, his performance went up. Worst performing stocks in the S&P. Here's some opportunity list. UPS looks starting to look interesting. Dow, Target, we've talked about a lot of these. Um, Lulu, we keep looking at in passing. Centine, we got to do more work on a lot of exposure to Medicaid. Uh, investor positioning still not extreme. So interesting. It's amazing how much the market's moved and how much this rally is still hated, which people have to keep buying now to catch up and keep their jobs. Cyclicals over defensive. Um, I think you're going to see more defensive start to outperform. That was a key thing that I wanted to remind you of with that Buffett chart. You haven't had an opportunity to buy staples at these prices in over 25 years. Very similar to energy, very similar to small caps. Um, these are generational opportunities. Maybe they don't turn the next day, but within months and they just keep going for years. More cuts favored defensives. This game is starting now. Percentage of S&P companies with positive 3-month percent changes in forward revenues going straight up. Small cap tailwinds include rate cuts and earnings recovery. We've been covering that 27% earnings growth versus large cap 14%. What else you want to talk about? And yet everyone's chasing everything that worked in the rearview mirror and no one's paying attention to what's going to work through the windshield. So much for sale in May. Okay, market went up average 12 months later up another 9.3% in line with some of the other stuff we've been talking about. Equity sentiment is still neutral despite the move. waiting of mag seven again 35% that's going to change very quickly uh in my view one family houses sold starting to pick up as rates came down in the last couple of months Alibaba shares rallied to 4year high no one's bingo card except for hedge fund tips with Tom Hayes listeners and great hill capital clients smiling so wide they could eat a watermelon sideways uh weekly net buying by client type biggest outflows of large caps in over two years. S&P lower finan today's S&P has lower financial leverage than the the 1990s. That this is not only happening across corporate balance sheets. This is happening about around US households lowest debt service to income in decades. Household balance sheets are very healthy. We uh went through this actually talked with Larry Cuddlo a lot about this off off uh off air uh between commercials. Uh it was really nice. That was the first time I was ever on. I met him in person years ago but that was the first time that I was ever on with him live and he was so nice and he even came up to me in agreement after and talked for another 10-15 minutes. That was really an honor to be on with Larry Cuddlo. Legendary Larry Cuddlo. Alibaba integrates Nvidia's AI robotics tool tools on cloud platform stocks up. Alibaba stores on AI spending hike.

Big tech's AI ambitions are straining the US power grid. Natural gas might be its answer. might. How about will? Companies pouring billions to advance AI infrastructure. All helps natural gas. Trump seeks to sp speed large power projects to meet AI demand. What does that mean? It means generators from Generrack. It means natural gas. It means lithium demand for battery storage with Albamaro, which is on the move today on the back of that uh US investment in uh that tiny lithium u US lithium USA or whatever the hell it's called.

Quick PayPal update. Despite Mr. Market's rather muted reaction last week, PayPal delivered exactly the type of shock the world move Alex Chris first promised when he took the reigns as CEO, signing a multi-year deal with Google on digital commerce. Agentic shopping and commerce experiences, broad embedding of PayPal solutions across Google platforms, expanded payment processing. The partnership cementss PayPal as a key payment service provider across products like Google Ads, Google Cloud, Google Play. What exactly does key means? We do not fully know yet, but we know this. Last quarter, Google Ads generated 71.3 billion in revenue. That's 280 billion a year. Google Cloud brought in 13.6. Call it 40. Call it 50 billion a year. 52. Whether this means PayPal will now process 10 or 40% of payments. Either way, it like represents a significant uplift to TPV, total payment volume. In other words, if you are part of the multi-billion dollar user Google ecosystem using any of their products, chances are PayPal is now your payment processor. On top of that, PayPal can leverage Google AI capabilities to enhance payment services and build out Agentic shopping with the added bonus of not having to shell out tens of billions in capex to develop it from scratch. aka PayPal is another example of playing the beneficiaries of AI without owning the companies that are forced to pick up the tab and erode earnings in the process. Meanwhile, you can still get you still can't give the stock away. For us, there's nothing to overthink with PayPal. Alex Chris is a proven winner and continues to execute on everything he promised from the very beginning and then some. The only problem is the market just can't wait. At least not until the story is so obvious it hits them over the head. If you're wondering when we'll see that play out in real time, look no further than Justin Mammoth sentiment cycle. You can see here enthusiasm down to discouragement, up to wall of worry, up to anxiety, down to aversion, up to denial, back to returning confidence with the parabolic move. Where are we? We are in aversion. Getting ready for denial into the parabolic move. A few months behind BABA. After climbing the wall of worry all the way up to $90 a share, we reached the anxiety stage and are now knocked back into aversion. It won't be long from here before we move into denial and then quickly break out, working our way back to confidence, by which point we'll likely be sitting on a double from our cost basis. Tomorrow's newspaper today, PayPal actually reminds us a lot of Alibaba, which is likely just a few months ahead on the sentiment cycle. With Alibaba, we've just broken through denial and are starting the parabolic move back towards new highs. Both stocks have been grinding sideways for the past 3 years, but as we'd like to say, you can only hold a beach ball underwater for so long. Alibaba is just beginning to break the surface and we don't expect PayPal to be much farther behind. Ali Albamaro update. There's been a lot of noise over the past couple months surrounding Albamaro. By the way, it was up today on the deal uh that the government did with Lithium USA. um which is not in this article but uh months surrounding Albamar the world's largest and lowest cost lithium producer whipsawing both its share price and the broader lithium market after grinding sideways near multi-year lows in the wake of liberation day selloff the stock began to catch a bid on the news of Chinese anti-involution campaign and efforts to curb over capacity. This was welcome news for Albamaro shareholders and the overall lithium market which has been in surplus since late 2022 largely due to small-cale subsidized producers in China now seemingly being taken off in line offline. The rally continued when cattle CL the world's largest battery maker suspended production at one of its largest lithium mines about 4% of global supply in 2024 for 6 to 12 months because of expired mining permit. That news helped push lithium prices from multi-year lows of 8,500 per metric ton to around 12,000 almost 50% by late August. The gains proved short-lived, however, with CL reopening the mine after 1 month, sending prices back down to 10,400 per metric ton, still well above the summer lows. At the end of the day, all of the recent headlines and volatility are really just noise for Albamaro. The short-term supply and demand swings are merely fits and starts in what we continue to view as the very beginning of a multi-year secular cycle. The only thing that truly matters and moves the needle is the chart below. Lithium carbonate cost curve based on 2026 estimated capabilities. Because Albamo sits at the very bottom of the cost curve, it has been able to do what any best-in-class operator does in a downturn. Cut costs 400 million in savings, dial back capex 650 to 700 million this year versus 2.1 billion in 2023, and sit on their hands and wait for the cycle to inevitably turn. Meanwhile, the Johnny come lately that rushed into chasing record high lithium prices in late 2021 are still huddled under their desk in the fetal position, hoping prices bail them out. The longer lithium prices stay in the pain zone, the more of these lowquality marginal producers will get carried out on a stretcher with or without the added push from China's anti-involution campaign. And even after a handful of Chinese miners have been taken offline, Alba Miles Management still sees 40% of global lithium capacity at or below break even with only about one-third of that supply removed so far. At these prices, it's only a matter of time before the rest, i.e. the players on the far right of the cost curve with production costs two times album start dropping like flies. This should continue to support Albamaro and lithium prices from the supply side with management expecting the current surplus to peak as early as this year. the market returning to balance in 2026 and potentially swinging into deficit by 2027 and beyond. Meanwhile, while the supply side tends to dominate the headlines, what doesn't get nearly enough attention and is arguably even more consequential is demand. Lithium consumption is already up 35% year-to- date. And at current prices, demand is outpacing supply by nearly 20% and there's no slowdown in sight. By 2030, lithium demand will be more than 2x driven by EVs and stationary storage, hitting 2.5 to 3.3 uh MMT LC versus 1.2 MMT in 2020 for 10 to 15% KAGER. Even if these estimates prove only halfright, Albamar won't be able to keep up with demand curve in the coming years. So, while Mr. Market remains fixated on short-term supply noise, we see one of the clearest secular plays on the market. Rather than overthinking it, we are happy to sit on our hands, add on any weakness, and watch the story play out. Here's everything you need to know from Q2 earnings. Can go through this. We've highlighted all the important parts both from the deck and from the earnings call. But here are the 10 key points. Q2 net sales 1.3 billion, down 7% year-on-year, but up sequentially beat Street estimates by 102 million. Energy storage volumes rose 15% and specialties grew 6%. Though these gains were more than offset by lower lithium pricing, adjusted Ebidok came in in 336 million, down 12.9% year-on-year, but upsequentially as lower input costs and cost-saving initiatives were m mostly offset by weaker pricing. And market demand number two for lithium remains strong with global consumption up 35% year-to- date. Growth has been driven by 126% surge in global stationary storage battery production through May with all three major regions showing strength. China up 80%, Europe up 150%, North America up 160% yearonear. EV demand has also remained robust, up 35% yearon year to date with China accounting for over 60% of the global market and growing 41% year to date. Management continues to believe more capacity needs to come offline, noting little change in global capacity since last quarter, aside from a few sites in China. Last quarter estimate 40% of global capacity at or below break even with only onethird offline. Year-to- date, Albamaro estimates lithium demand has outpaced supply by nearly 20%. And if current pricing holds, expects demand to outstrip supply by 10% through 2030. Most importantly, management expects the current surplus, which has persisted since late 2022, to peak as early as this year, with the market likely more balanced in 2026 and potentially returning to deficits in 2027 and beyond. four for the full year. Management continues to expect 15 to 40% lithium demand growth driven by strength in stationary storage and EVs. Sales volume growth is now expected to near the high end of the 0 to 10% year-on-year range. Looking longer term, management expects lithium demand to more than double by 2030, reaching 2.5 to 3.3 million metric tonses uh versus 1.2. Five, management has achieved 100% of the high end of its cost and productivity improvement target, hitting $400 million, six months ahead of the original plan, which aimed for 300 to 400 million in savings by year end. These improvements have already driven over 20% reduction in SGNA costs year to date with full benefits expected in 2026. Alba Mar's balance sheet remains very strong with 1.8 billion in cash and cash equivalents. Total liquidity of 3.4 billion. Debt stands at 3.6 billion. 100% is fixed rates with a 3.6% 6% weighted average interest rate. Net leverage is just two 2.3 times well below the Q2 covenant limit of limit of 5.75 times. De leveraging remains a top priority with 440 million in debt maturing in Q4 expected to be paid off using cash on hand. Seven in the first half of 2025, Albamaro generated 530 million in operating cash flow up 73 million year with an 89% conversion rate. management expected conversion above 80% for the full year, well ahead of its long-term 60 to 70% target driven by 350 million customer prepayment and continued working capital improvements. Most importantly, management now projects positive free cash flow for 2025 versus prior expectations of only break even. Management further lowered its fullear capex outlook to 650 to 700 million down from a prior target of 700 to 800 million. This implies a 60% reduction from 2024's 1.7 billion, already a low base compared to 2023's 2.1 billion as management continues to focus on projects with the highest returns and fastest payback in the face of cycllically low prices. Nine fullear direct tariff impacts remain immaterial to album special thanks to critical mineral exemptions and global sourcing footprint. Management now expects the impact to be roughly 50% lower than the initial 30 to 40 million range implying a 17.5 million hit to at the midpoint and 10 about 50% of the overall mix is now sold under long-term arrangements all of which include floors and have average duration of 2 to 5 years. No significant contracts are up for renewal in 2025 while two contracts are scheduled for renegotiation toward the end of 2026 with management expecting both to be extended rather than expire.

Uh top 30 weights of the retail sector earnings estimates have gone up by 1.93% in the last 60 days. Transports top 30 weights revised down 1.75. I'm guessing this is skewed. Carrier had a big downgrade. That's interesting. Carrier is really making the biggest difference. It looks like Wait a second. C. No, that's Avis. Yeah, that's a that's that's a bag of fleas. All right. Um, yeah, Avis, what a disaster. All right, that's retail transports. Okay, economic data. The key is PCE this week, but actually the most important stuff is going to be the jobs report in a week and a half. Uh, earnings uh, estimates continue to go up. 13.7% earnings growth. Now, on to the ask me anything questions. Okay, I'm only going to cover the key ones today. I I don't have time to take 30. Uh let's see. Uh, this is from Nate Kelsey asks about master brand cabinets. Converted my brother and my brother-in-law into fervent listeners. We've all made lots of money and are very grateful for your opinions on advice. Thank you very much, Nate. Um, all right. MDC, this is a housing play basically. I like that start. Looks like it's starting to inflect a little bit. Let's take a look at the balance sheet. This was spun out of Fortune Brands 1954. Have to ask my buddy Tony who does high-end cabinets all over the place. Uh cash debt. Yeah, this is pretty levered. Billion dollars of debt, $100 million of cash. What's the free cash flow? 68 million. I like the theme. I don't know if I love this idea. 2.6 billion. So, it's seven times eBay, give or take. Yeah, I mean this is probably going to be okay. It hasn't Yeah. Let me see. I don't love the leverage, although I think they'll be okay. You know, it's hard when they they haven't been operating on a standalone basis long enough for me to get excited. sometimes they get the benefit of parent co and then when they're on their own, but I do like spin-offs. Um I think we just have to understand the debt structure before before we did any further thing. I like the theme. I kind of like the company but um just want to understand when the maturities are and go from there. All right. Um good question, good idea. Understand the debt. H thank you. Steve just said, "I'm smiling so wide I could eat bananas sideways." He's been a he's been a longtime client and uh he upped uh well over five million and I'm very grateful for that. And uh and now you're reaping the benefits and it's early early days. All right. Um oh that's a sorry that's the wrong inbox. That's why Jay Annalie. No, I'm not interested in Analy. I mean, if you're just buying it for the if you have to buy one of these, you Annalie is probably the highest quality. Um, it's a mortgage rate. I Man, they've destroyed this thing. Hold. Wait, no. Uh, NLY. Sorry. Yeah. I mean, the time to buy it was at 11, not at 20. So, I No, not for me. Matt Skates asks about Ken View. Yeah, I you know what I mean? I met the CEO at uh the Al Smith dinner and uh he was a nice guy and his wife was nice. I I didn't like it then. I don't like it now. I think you have a little bit too much uncertainty. I don't think you have a woman in this country who's going to take Tylenol for a long long time. Um, so that goes in the too hard box. I mean, you could dumpster dive here. You're probably okay with the rest of the portfolio, but why why why do that? That goes in the too hard box. JT investor, how will the lithium America's affect Albamaro? It's just noise. I mean, yeah, it got a bump today on that, but the name of the game is supply and demand and having the best lowest cost producer in the world. So, you just focus on that. Unfocus on the headlines. The headlines are probably a little bit of a tailwind, but have no bearing on why we're involved. Zachary, if a correction doesn't come in September, would you expect one in October? I don't care about what the general indices do. I buy individual companies when they're on sale and there are plenty of great companies on sale. Whether the S&P goes down 5%, 10% or up 5% or 10% is absolutely the the um you know any pullbacks are going to be relatively short-lived. Uh Maria who reached out I will call you back and yes you can uh open an account from there. Um, Theo Dujardan, great work on your patient but firm conviction on Ali F and Baba. Truly remarkable how you shifted through the noise and headlines were against you. Thank you very much. Oh, he's uh Yeah. All right. Next, Maria R. Got that. John L. Dagio's debt. No, you have to break down the maturities relative to free cash flow, which we've done a hundred times. The AIO is best in class. They're going to be great. Moving along. Martin, by the way, a lot of these questions I can tell we have a lot of new listeners. So, I'm very excited for all the growth that we're experiencing. I'm very grateful for that. if I uh don't thoroughly answer your questions because we've covered it a hundred times in past podcasts and you will learn as you go along the philosophy and the framework and you won't have uh you'll have different questions moving forward. Thoughts on UPS from Martin? We've covered that over and over. We like it. We don't we're not doing anything with it at the moment, but we like it. Marco Stalari Marshalls MHL. It's pink sheet stock. I don't think it is a R. No, I think you got that wrong, my man. That must I think that's part of TJ Maxx. Um, okay, Brandon, you're all set. I did get back to you, Jacob M. Great, Jacob M. Uh, great podcast. Been a follower for over a year now. Got a friend listening to it now as well. Thank you and welcome to your friend. Have been an Intel PayPal believer. Excited to see where those go. Question energy. Understand National and Commtock. checking out Northern Oil and Gas NOG. I don't think the ENTPs have come down enough relative to the underlying price. I don't like it here. Um, so I'll leave it at that. I've looked at this one. I like servicesers and uh I think servicesers and natural gas plays represent the greatest values in in that space right now. LZ, you've mentioned that PE and private credit don't mark to market. So, how do investors know if their investment is worth anything during the holding period? They don't. Uh, if it goes to zero, they'll only know when it's too late. Would you ever invest in something like this? I would not, but obviously there are good private equity managers, of course. But you got to know what the underlying assets are and underwrite them individually because you're not going to get the warning sign that you get in the public markets uh so that you can adjust. You're going they're going to collect 2% fees until it's marked down to zero. And that's just the way it goes every cycle. Steve Mayo. Uh, Rich Tech Robotics. This is Chasing Headlines, so the answer is no. Um, looks like a penny stock trade, so it might work from a trading standpoint, but I don't think it's going to be something we're interested in, but let's just take a No, they're negative free cash flow. Revenues are No, this is a headline. Momo stock. So maybe the Roaring Kitties of the world will push it up, but I'm not going to be playing those reindeer games. Um, Ron Gino, hey Ron, what do you think of Scope Technologies, Micro Cap, Quantum Cyber Security? Would I ever take a risk? Not in a million years. Uh, S C P C F. No, they're losing money. They're destroying owner's capital. This is just a gamble on the headline of the day and we don't do that. Um, Bill Magdal don't know what that is. Bill, you're going to have to be more specific. Uh, Veronica Winters, thank you for your insight. Much appreciated indeed. What do you think of caring? PP P R U Y French Luxury Retail. I think this is Hermes. PR UY. Yeah, this is starting to recover. This reminds me of Estee Lauder, which we already own. Um, this is probably okay. Gucci, Eve, St. Lauron, Bayga, Brioni. Yeah, I I think you're going to be all right here. Let's just take a look. Man, the revenues are really falling off here though. The cash flow is 178 balance sheet 3.6 billion on 10 billion of debt. Okay. I mean, this has had a pretty big bounce. I would I would be waiting for it to show some if you could get it if it pulls back a little bit. Revisit it. I mean, it's trading at 20 times IBIDA enterprise value to IBIDA. I mean, you're not really getting I I don't like this one as much. I I'm going to say pass, but I think it'll probably work. Okay. I'd rather do Estee Lauder. Dan B A uh really love the show. Congratulations on a great run. You taking a look at Amcor? This has been a compounder. I've looked at Amcore over the years. But the price Yeah. Uh you're I think you're fine here. I don't think you're going to make a ton of money and get doubles and triples, but I think you'll have a business that compounds okay over time. So, uh not a bad one. Kagra we covered last week. I like all these defensives with dividend growing companies. I think Kagra is okay. Colopass CLBY. Guys, don't send me uh penny stocks anymore. Um I don't I don't have time for that. We can't put any real money to work and I don't think we're doing a service to the listeners. So, let's just take a little LPBY. It's not a penny stock. It must be an international stock on the pink sheets. Let's see here. Healthc care products and services in Denmark. Catheters. So, this is antifungal products, urinary incontinents. So, it's like a medical device. I'd rather play Baxter. Um, okay. Let's see here. I think you're probably okay here. Just take a look at the balance sheet. Yeah, you just have to watch their balance sheet. They're a little leveraged for what they are. Uh decent free cash flow, you're probably okay here, but I think they're higher and better uses of your cash. Next. Uh, what are we looking for here? RM Brookfield Renewables. Um, that's from RM. No, not for me. Next. Shelley Patson four. Shift for payments. No, thank you. This is a broken growth stock. I'm not interested. Only payment company I'd buy is PayPal. Croa International. This might be interesting. chemical business and their cash flows dropped off. It looks like their revenues are trying just getting worse and worse return on capital. Let's see what their balance sheet looks like. Cash is 200 million. Debt is 700. Free cash flow 176. Looks generally okay share count. So okay. Yeah, I think it's worth doing more work. Understand the debt maturities. understand what is the turnaround situation because this is certainly a broken growth stock down 80% but uh probably a pony in this pile. Um let's move on. Ibeck Arinoff. Hey, recently started listening to your podcast. Thank you for bringing value. It's illegal that it's free. I agree. Uh what are your thoughts on Snap? It's trading at all-time lows right now, but monthly active uses keep growing. Spectacles eyewear and other revenue streams, negative income. I I don't like it. I don't trust the guy. He's been a destructor of wealth. Um, not for me. At least with Zuckerberg, you know what you get. The guy likes to make money. This guy, I don't know. He's making glasses. I just don't see it working. Um, let me see if there's any signs of hope. If I recall, this guy was a pig with stock. Let me just see. All right. So, it is inflecting. But they just can't get out of their way. I mean, revenues have been declining for four years now. And and he's a pig with stock. I mean, the share counts up double in the last eight years. Free cash flow starting to recover. I mean, tell me what the turnaround story is, and maybe you you take a shot at this, but Sky just hasn't done right by shareholders, and I don't see him changing stripes. Um, uh, Tom Ferrell, hey Tom, love the show. New listener was told by a friend. Welcome. Told my dad and brother a couple buddies. Love the show. What do you think of Constellation brands? I know that you like DEO, but wasn't sure how you felt. Uh, I think it's gonna be okay. I just don't want the beer ones. I want the premiumization ones. So, Constellation doesn't fit that need. I think it works when the group starts to work, but I'd rather have Dagio. I think your theme is correct. I think your execution um is is, you know, second or third best. Um, but will probably work. Swatch group. Ah, I don't like that one. I you know everyone I keep getting this and it's no edge personal carrier. This is from Paul Girtz EPC. Yeah, I've looked at this one a few times. I haven't done anything with it, but I do think it's probably ready. Um, you you're going to just have to understand the turnaround story because it looks dead. I mean, you're buying it cheap, but I don't see anything that's going to turn it around. So, what do they have? shave. You know, it is a defensive. Do they have a dividend 3%. So, this probably works in the staples category, but the razor business wet ones, I just want to see where's where's the revenue reaceleration going to come from. If you can get that, then maybe take a stab at it. I think you're probably generally in the right direction for sure. Ethan WY. Hey Tom, really appreciate you sharing your wealth and knowledge in the podcast. I've been a listener for a few years now. Put all my friends on. Thank you. My question is regarding Intel's long-term success. Spoke with my girlfriend about Intel's deal with Nvidia. Later, I received a text that her mother had. I put a significant amount in stock after the parabolic move up to 30%. That's not a parabolic move. It was just a jump. My question is where do you see intel reaching? Am I and am I on the chopping block of this relationship if it fails? Uh well, what's the basis for you getting in? I mean, uh for me, I think it's going to go a lot higher on the basis of they're the only game in town after Taiwan Semiconductor and all the forces are behind it. But would I buy a stock after a 50% move in a day? Absolutely not. I'd wait for it to settle down. Why would you chase it up after a 50% move? That makes zero sense. So, your execution is incorrect. Your thesis is correct. Uh, you'll be fine over time, but I wouldn't it wouldn't shock me at all to see this go to 26 or 27 before it goes to 40 or 50 and beyond. But, um, I think you're going to be fine. Michael Costa, Helen of Troy. It's like again another kind of consumer staple. This is going to take a few years to build a new set of shareholders, but it's cash flow positive. So, tell me how the revenues are going to start to turn around. Um, what's the balance sheet look like? 42 million in receivables. How much debt? Yeah, that seems all right. Cash flow income statement. All right, seems okay there. What do they sell? Home and outdoor beauty and wellness, kitchen utensils, uh, slicers, choppers, baking essentials. Yeah, this is kind of housing play. I think you're okay, but you got to get understanding on how they're going to turn around revenues. And if you can do that, you should be fine with Helen of Troy. Um, Manuel Nor. Yeah, I like Selines. Good. And that's it. We'll be back next week, same time. Uh, or you know, normal time. Uh, back to California. In the meantime, make it a great one. Bye for now. Heat. Heat.
