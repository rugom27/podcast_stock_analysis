[0.56s] Welcome to Hedge Fund Tips with Tom
[2.72s] Hayes. I&#39;m Tom Hayes and this is your
[5.2s] 292nd videocast podcast for the week
[7.6s] ending May 20th, 2025 live from Dubai. I
[12.0s] want to thank my
[13.639s] incredible friends, hosts here in Dubai.
[18.24s] Uh, Phillip, Chris, Allan, Charlotte,
[20.56s] Mish, Dakota, Imran, David, Matt, Pash,
[23.92s] John, Connor, Minoj, Rosemary, Sarah,
[27.359s] Haley, Carolyn, Samantha, and more.
[31.279s] Anyone I missed, I&#39;m going to get you on
[33.68s] the next time I&#39;m back. You will be at
[36.32s] the top of the list. Big shout out to
[38.64s] Charlotte for arranging all the seamless
[40.8s] travel, the pickups in Miami, the
[43.44s] beautiful flight on Emirates. Got to
[45.6s] sleep flatbed the whole way. Well, not
[47.6s] the whole way, but a good six hours. Uh,
[50.48s] all the events backtoback. And tomorrow
[52.96s] we get to play Emirates Golf Club where
[54.96s] all the tournaments are. I&#39;m super
[56.48s] excited about that. Going to finally get
[58.239s] in some sightseeing. We&#39;ve been
[59.44s] backtoback work. Uh, but just
[62.079s] overwhelmed by the incredible team here.
[65.519s] So grateful for my friends and client
[68.4s] and um can&#39;t wait to come back soon.
[70.799s] This has just been such a special trip
[73.28s] and uh and and another great day to
[75.439s] come. So, as always, family first. Let&#39;s
[79.2s] get right down to it. Mimi and her team
[81.119s] played the Sailors Cup this weekend. She
[82.96s] had a ton of goals and assist, and she&#39;s
[84.56s] looking forward to getting ready to play
[86.24s] in Junior Olympic qualifiers in two
[88.64s] weeks. Annabelle got two additional
[90.159s] press mentions in Swim Swam. Shout out
[92.56s] to the folks over at Swim Swam on their
[94.32s] weekly Wonders Blast. She also had a
[96.479s] swim meet this weekend and set a new
[98.32s] Nova team record in the 200 meter IM.
[101.84s] Annabelle is currently leading number
[103.2s] one rankings for 10 U girls on USA
[105.6s] swimming this season and is looking
[107.119s] forward to swimming next weekend at the
[108.88s] Speedo Grand Challenge. So way to go
[111.68s] Annabelle. Let&#39;s do a couple quick
[113.759s] favorite goals of Mimi.
[117.68s] She takes the steel here. Watch this
[119.6s] action. I love that. Unbelievable.
[123.439s] Take the ball. Takes down the whole
[125.759s] thing with her
[127.399s] wheels. And she just places this action
[130.319s] right here.
[132.48s] These are my top. And my second favorite
[134.8s] was this one where she just does this.
[139.44s] Watch this amazing pass from the goalie.
[144.64s] Look at this Tom Brady arm right to
[148.2s] Mimi. Look at this
[151.84s] little lollipop action. How you doing?
[154.48s] All right, let&#39;s get down to it here. Uh
[157.84s] then we had uh the money show in Miami.
[160.72s] This is South Beach. Got to spend a
[162.16s] little sightseeing there on the last
[163.599s] day. Pretty cool. Always fun. This is
[166.239s] Dr. Jart. Um, uh, Kyong Lee came from
[172.319s] Korea to the Money Show to see the
[175.2s] presentation. He&#39;s a longtime podcast
[177.44s] fan. Can&#39;t thank him enough. And he
[179.92s] brought Dr. Jart. So, for those of you
[181.84s] who don&#39;t know, Estee Lauder owns a ton
[183.519s] of brands, like a dozen brands. People
[185.36s] think it&#39;s just Estee Lauder for old
[186.879s] ladies and you know that that
[188.959s] demographic is is uh getting smaller and
[191.599s] smaller. Uh they also own Dr. Jart which
[194.159s] is super popular among young kids. The
[196.48s] fact that he knew this is amazing
[198.56s] because when I was talking to my girls
[200.08s] about Estee Lauder, they couldn&#39;t
[202.159s] believe that they owned Dr. Jart. He
[204.48s] brought this all the way on the plane
[205.92s] for my girls. So shout out to Kayong Sun
[209.12s] Lee from Korea that came all the way to
[211.599s] the money show and brought my daughters
[212.959s] these incredible gifts. They can&#39;t wait
[214.56s] till I get home for the skin care. Uh uh
[218.879s] and then this is at the hotel again.
[222.799s] Charlotte and the whole team uh put me
[225.44s] up right close to they&#39;re in the
[226.959s] financial district. So the Ritz is the
[228.48s] closest. And this breakfast I haven&#39;t
[230.319s] been to India in over 20 years. I forgot
[232.56s] how good this stuff was. Chili pickle,
[235.28s] mango, mango pickle, and lemon pickles.
[238.4s] I know we have some Indian followers. Uh
[241.2s] I&#39;ve never tasted it. Like when I lived
[242.959s] in India for a little while, uh the the
[246.64s] mango pickle, chili pickle, and lemon
[248.4s] pickles at the Ritz Carlton in Dubai are
[252.08s] even better. Past Salt Bay for those of
[254.48s] you who follow on Tik Tok. We ate at a
[256.88s] different restaurant, but uh that was
[258.72s] pretty cool. I&#39;m going to get that next
[260.0s] time. Here&#39;s some pictures of the
[261.359s] awesome building. Such a vibrant city.
[263.759s] That&#39;s out of their office uh with that
[266.479s] special ring
[267.96s] there. That&#39;s the financial district
[270.32s] building. Uh that&#39;s Dubai. I&#39;m going to
[272.8s] do a lot more
[273.96s] sightseeing.
[277.08s] Uh Rob, unbelievable coper. Uh wearing
[282.16s] the hedge fund
[283.639s] tips golf polo. Got to spend three days
[287.72s] together. Longtime loyal podcast
[290.72s] listener. I couldn&#39;t. Rob, we had such a
[292.96s] great time. It was so much fun to see
[295.68s] you. Thank you so much for coming to all
[297.84s] three presentations and taking the time
[300.56s] to talk. That&#39;s with Jeff. Jeff has just
[303.12s] been doing an unbelievable job with the
[305.28s] earnings calls, writing up the weekly uh
[309.08s] articles of the week, doing an
[311.44s] incredible job. That&#39;s his girlfriend&#39;s
[313.199s] brother, Noah. We had some good time,
[315.44s] good dinners. Uh there&#39;s Caillong from
[318.08s] Korea came all the way. Pretty awesome.
[321.199s] There&#39;s Jeff. got got me all set up on
[323.36s] the AV stuff or we wouldn&#39;t have had a
[325.199s] presentation. That&#39;s me talking about
[327.199s] who uh none other than Brad Jacobs.
[330.08s] Well, I think we&#39;re going to talk about
[331.28s] that. That&#39;s with Ed Yardi and my buddy
[333.44s] Kenny Pulcari at the speakers dinner. Um
[337.6s] that&#39;s the panel with Mike Lee. You know
[339.44s] him from Fox Business, my buddy down
[341.6s] there. This is uh Mike Bennett uh the
[345.759s] guy who co-wrote Stack and Tilt and
[348.24s] revolutionized the golf industry over a
[350.72s] decade ago working on my follow-through.
[353.199s] This is how it&#39;s supposed to look. This
[354.72s] is not how it looked when I came down.
[356.8s] This is how we hope it&#39;s going to look
[359.0s] prospectively. Thanks so much to Mike B.
[361.36s] Bennett. got me on to uh Banyan Golf
[365.759s] Club in West Palm Beach, one of the most
[369.639s] incredible clubs in the country.
[372.4s] Certainly in Florida, you know, probably
[375.52s] half a mill initiation fee. We paid
[378.24s] that. We played that. This was the
[380.24s] speaker dinner. You know, Edard Denny,
[382.479s] you know, Mike Lee, you know Kenny
[383.759s] Pulcari, uh from Fox Business. Uh that&#39;s
[387.28s] Mike Larson, Kim Gler. We&#39;re we&#39;re going
[389.28s] to thank them all. Absolutely incredible
[391.36s] time. There&#39;s my buddy Mike. That&#39;s
[393.759s] Banyan. That was awesome. It&#39;s been a
[395.44s] whirlwind couple weeks. That was at the
[397.44s] studio right before I left the claiming
[399.36s] countdown with Cheryl Cassone. Uh this
[402.08s] was the same day I did a podcast which
[404.56s] will be out next week for Yahoo. Jared
[407.6s] Blickery and Sydney Frerieded at the
[410.759s] NYSC. That was at Yahoo with Julie.
[413.44s] We&#39;ll get into that. NYSE. Uh pretty
[416.0s] busy week, ladies and gentlemen. Okay,
[418.319s] so now we got besides Rob uh and besides
[422.639s] uh we saw last week John, we got another
[425.52s] photo in from Janick Munch. We&#39;re going
[428.16s] to start putting all these photos up as
[430.639s] they come in in the coming weeks looking
[433.36s] great in that hat. Rob looking
[435.44s] incredible in his golf polo. John last
[438.479s] week showing off his merch. Uh, and now
[441.68s] down to
[445.88s] media. Got to
[448.039s] join Cheryl Cassone on Fox Business. I
[452.08s] want to thank Brooke Haliscak for having
[454.8s] me on. We&#39;re going to listen in now. And
[456.96s] well, as President Trump continues to
[458.8s] flex his art of the deal muscles on his
[461.199s] trek across the Gulf region. But my next
[464.0s] guests both say there&#39;s another name to
[466.4s] have in your portfolio who&#39;s also
[468.24s] bringing the happiest place on earth to
[471.12s] the Middle East. Let&#39;s get right to our
[473.12s] floor show. Joining me now is Grey Hill
[475.039s] Capital Chairman Thomas Hayes and
[476.8s] Freedom Capital Markets chief global
[478.56s] strategist Jay Woods live from the New
[481.12s] York Stock Exchange. Tom, you and Jay.
[484.08s] Tom, I&#39;ll start with you. You both like
[485.599s] Disney. There&#39;s no question about it.
[487.28s] You know, uh, this rally that we&#39;ve seen
[489.12s] in the last four weeks, it&#39;s like
[490.319s] Buffett always said, if you wait for the
[492.24s] Robins to sing, it&#39;s already spring.
[493.759s] We&#39;re up 15% since Donald Trump tweeted.
[496.319s] Now is a great time to buy stocks. Last
[498.639s] week, he said US is going to boom.
[500.96s] Disney is a beneficiary. We were on the
[502.72s] network four weeks ago saying, &quot;Buy
[504.319s] Disney at $85. It&#39;s 111.&quot; Guess what?
[507.68s] It&#39;s going over 200 over the next three
[509.68s] years. All of their divisions are
[511.759s] hitting on all cylinders. Mid double
[513.76s] digit growth. the cruise ships, the
[515.599s] parks, streaming, 180 million
[518.32s] subscribers. They added two and a half
[519.839s] million subscribers. This is a high
[521.839s] quality business with a durable mode.
[523.68s] Well, and Jay, the concern as we were
[525.36s] going into Disney&#39;s earnings was worries
[527.36s] about the theme parks and that ended up
[530.0s] being uh one of the positives along with
[532.16s] of course who was going to replace uh
[533.839s] Bob Iger and Disney Plus. Jay, why do
[536.72s] you like Disney? Well, I look at it from
[539.12s] a technical level. This stock had been
[540.72s] beaten down for years. We finally had a
[543.12s] nice constructive base and then a
[544.959s] breakout above that 200 day moving
[546.8s] average, a breakout of a long-term
[548.32s] downtrend and then you put all the
[550.16s] fundamental stories that the last guest
[552.08s] just mentioned. And yeah, this is a
[553.92s] recipe where if you want to get in this
[555.6s] name, riskreward, there&#39;s much greater
[558.24s] reward on the horizon than the risks.
[560.16s] Now, we&#39;ll see what the secession line
[561.92s] is, but uh something tells me Iger is
[564.24s] going to do this one a little bit better
[565.92s] than he did the last time he left
[567.36s] Disney. and uh that shareholders that
[569.76s] have been holding on are finally going
[571.12s] to be rewarded and if we can get to that
[573.519s] three-year target, we&#39;ll be talking
[574.72s] all-time highs. But uh that news this
[576.959s] week was fantastic. Technically, it&#39;s
[579.279s] blessed as well. So, I love it for a
[581.44s] long-term play and put it away. We also
[583.44s] showed our viewers while you were
[584.64s] speaking, Jay, uh Uber, you like Uber,
[587.12s] you say that this is a stock that&#39;s
[588.959s] going to be 120 bucks by the end of the
[590.88s] year. Uh Tom, I do want to go back to
[592.72s] you. Let&#39;s talk about the macro story
[594.48s] because one of the things you say and I
[596.08s] think this is so interesting. You say
[597.76s] but the good news there&#39;s a lot of
[598.959s] trapped bears out there. I like that
[601.36s] terminology and what you say is that
[603.12s] each new trade deal is as it&#39;s announced
[605.12s] is forcing them to buy everybody that
[607.36s] sold wrong. Yeah, you bet. Beginning of
[609.839s] April record selling $1.1 trillion
[612.64s] dollar of equity sold in the whole by
[614.32s] hedge funds and CTAs. Every single new
[616.8s] bit of positive news. Now they&#39;ve
[618.16s] covered the shorts. Now they have to
[620.0s] chase up. They did not believe this was
[622.079s] going to take place. They&#39;re g every
[623.6s] single headline. And by the way,
[624.88s] earnings earnings growth was double what
[626.88s] was expected. Even in the face of
[628.24s] uncertainty, now that we have more
[630.0s] certainty, guess what&#39;s going to happen?
[631.519s] Upgrades. Upgrades to guidance. They&#39;re
[633.36s] going to have to buy more and more and
[634.64s] more. Like Donald Trump said, the market
[636.64s] is going higher. Well, but also too,
[638.959s] Jay, just to be clear, I mean, we are
[640.88s] still in this this tariff environment.
[642.8s] We have this 90-day pause with China,
[645.2s] which is good news for a company like
[646.959s] Walmart. We&#39;re getting Walmart earnings
[648.8s] tomorrow. That&#39;s going to be at 7:00
[650.16s] a.m. Eastern time. You say that that
[652.88s] Walmart is going to be the barometer for
[654.72s] the tariff trade because of how that
[656.959s] they characterize they handle what has
[659.68s] been the last quarter for them, which of
[662.16s] course was concerns about their supply
[663.68s] chain. Yeah, I think we&#39;re still a far
[666.56s] way from certainty in this market. We&#39;re
[668.88s] getting a little more certain, but uh
[670.959s] there are a lot more questions on the
[672.24s] tariff front and I think Walmart is the
[673.68s] bellweather that may be able to give us
[675.68s] a little peak behind the curtain. They
[677.519s] were the first company to really guide
[678.959s] in January. They turned over in January
[680.8s] before we peaked February 19th. Broke a
[683.519s] long-term downtrend, held the 200 day
[685.44s] moving average, coming back, but still
[687.6s] not back to levels where it was trading
[689.44s] before. Granted, it was up 100% over 12
[692.32s] months between December, December last
[694.079s] year. Now, it&#39;s given back a little bit.
[697.04s] Uh we&#39;ll see what that guide is. if they
[699.04s] can tell us that inventory levels are
[700.56s] fine, they&#39;re not concerned about
[701.76s] tariffs, then uh we&#39;re a little more
[704.079s] clear about what the future will be as
[706.16s] far as the consumer goes. So, I&#39;m
[708.16s] watching it closely and uh right now
[710.24s] it&#39;s at an area where I&#39;ll wait to see
[712.56s] how things shake out, but if it does
[714.24s] sell off, I would buy it towards that 91
[716.56s] to 86 level uh for a long-term play and
[719.36s] put it away. Yeah. No, I mean, and the
[720.959s] concerns about your Walmart, your Target
[722.72s] are fair enough. And also, Tom, we&#39;re
[724.64s] going to get a big data dump in the
[726.0s] morning. So, we&#39;re going to get retail
[727.68s] sales. We&#39;re going to get um we&#39;re going
[729.68s] to get initial jobless claims uh PPI
[733.279s] that and then we also have uh Fed
[735.04s] Chairman Jerome Pal uh speaking. So
[737.12s] there&#39;s there&#39;s a lot at play tomorrow
[738.72s] that could could rock the markets. This
[741.68s] is the big question between the hard
[743.279s] data and the soft data. Consumers are
[745.04s] saying the world is ending, but they&#39;re
[746.399s] going out and spending like there&#39;s no
[747.839s] tomorrow. So let&#39;s see if it holds true
[749.6s] and we get good retail numbers tomorrow.
[751.36s] That&#39;ll be the catalyst. You know,
[752.72s] looking in the rearview mirror, we we
[754.56s] definitely see the uncertainty. looking
[755.92s] through the windshield, which is what
[757.12s] the stock market does. That uncertainty
[758.959s] is mitigating. We&#39;ve had the VIX
[760.56s] crushed. The uncertainty has come out of
[762.079s] the market. We look forward to positive
[763.68s] things moving forward. And you&#39;re both
[765.04s] very bullish. Jay, is there anything
[767.279s] that you&#39;re concerned about right now
[769.12s] that could upset the market, upset the
[771.12s] momentum that we had because, you know,
[772.88s] we were climbing this wall of worry was
[774.72s] so unfortunate during the all the tariff
[776.72s] drama. If that indeed is behind us and
[779.76s] these trade deals continue to be cut
[781.839s] once President Trump gets back from the
[783.839s] Middle East, does that tell you that the
[786.32s] rest of the year is going to be
[787.279s] positive? Well, we&#39;ve just kicked the
[789.44s] can down the proverbial road for now. We
[791.76s] still have 90 days on China, 90 days on
[794.56s] our some of our allies. These tax
[796.88s] levels, these tariff levels will have an
[798.72s] impact on the bottom line. So once we
[801.44s] get some more clarity on that 10% across
[803.2s] the board, that seems to be the magic
[804.88s] number that the market is absorbing. But
[807.2s] uh we still do not know exactly how this
[809.76s] will resolve. But we do like the
[811.68s] progress. The one thing we do know, the
[813.519s] worst seems to be over. That wash out,
[815.36s] that April 7th low, that was worst case
[818.0s] scenario, panic, capitulation, sentiment
[820.16s] at all-time lows. As a contrarian, as
[822.48s] someone that follows these markets, that
[824.0s] was the time to buy. Now, I&#39;m taking a
[826.079s] little on the sidelines because this
[827.839s] process, this V-shaped recovery probably
[830.8s] will pause before we make new highs.
[832.959s] Watch your favorite stock, Cheryl.
[834.639s] Nvidia when they report on March on May
[837.04s] 28th. I know we always talk about that
[838.8s] every time I&#39;m on the show, but that
[840.399s] will be a tell because we did see the
[842.399s] Mag 7 stocks continue to spend. Their
[845.04s] numbers should be good. They were good
[846.56s] last quarter, but we were afraid of
[848.24s] deepseat. Now we&#39;re afraid of tariffs
[850.0s] and China relations. So, let&#39;s see how
[852.0s] they do. If Nvidia can break out to new
[853.76s] highs, and we still have 16 points to
[855.68s] go, then uh the the bullish horns will
[858.32s] be sprouting out of my head. Right now,
[860.16s] I&#39;m kind of on the sidelines letting
[862.0s] things digest. Well, I think these deals
[864.0s] that President Trump has has been inking
[866.399s] uh so far in the Middle East, and it&#39;s
[868.0s] only day two of his his trip. Boy, I
[870.16s] tell you, this is this is magic for
[872.0s] Nvidia and and obviously a lot of those
[874.48s] companies that are that are trailing him
[876.72s] right now and following him around to
[878.24s] these meetings, these these summits in
[880.0s] particular with the Saudis. Uh Jay
[881.839s] Woods, Tom Hayes, guys, thank you so
[883.519s] much. Great to have you here for the top
[885.36s] of the show. I really appreciate it.
[887.04s] Thank you, Shirley. All right. Well,
[889.199s] President Trump making his second stop
[891.6s] on his three and we&#39;re back. Then I had
[895.279s] the pleasure to do the entire hour on
[898.24s] Yahoo Finance with Julie Heyman. Want to
[901.04s] thank Julie and Justin Oliver. Uh we
[904.88s] fortunately Stephen was able to edit
[907.279s] this so you don&#39;t have to listen to the
[908.72s] whole hour. He got like the top uh um
[912.079s] key points uh key minutes in from that.
[915.12s] So we&#39;ll listen in here. my co-host for
[917.68s] the hour, Thomas Hayes, Great Hill
[919.12s] Capital chairman and managing member.
[921.12s] Um, and Tom, obviously we&#39;ve seen
[922.88s] markets rebound and recover a lot of
[925.12s] ground in a short period of time. The
[926.639s] S&amp;P 500 now a little bit positive on the
[928.72s] year. What happens now? Well, we have a
[932.079s] lot of what we call trapped bears. Okay.
[934.56s] The data shows that in early April, you
[937.68s] had $1.1 trillion of selling in US
[941.199s] equities. That was predominantly hedge
[942.88s] funds and CTAs. So, first you had the
[945.36s] short covering rally after the tweet,
[947.04s] the famous, &quot;It&#39;s a good time to buy
[948.959s] stocks on April 9th.&quot; Now the market&#39;s
[951.04s] up 15%. So, they&#39;ve covered their
[953.12s] shorts. They&#39;re now chased and forced
[955.6s] buyers. So, I think as we continue to
[957.92s] see more deals cross the tape and there
[959.759s] have been rumblings, more deals are on
[961.199s] the way. You&#39;re going to have forced
[962.959s] buyers. That said, from a trading
[965.12s] standpoint, I think you move 15% in a
[967.36s] few weeks. You probably consolidate a
[969.279s] little bit and a lot of people have
[970.56s] jumped in Johnny come lately. Sometimes
[972.88s] you get a three four percent pullback
[974.399s] just to kind of shake those the the weak
[976.16s] hands out before we move higher. But
[978.56s] earnings are super strong. They the
[980.32s] earnings growth rate was twice what we
[982.079s] expected for this quarter. We were
[983.44s] expecting 6%. We got 13%. Estimates have
[986.8s] held up even in the face of all of that
[988.959s] uncertainty. Now that some of that
[990.72s] uncertainty is removed, we could start
[992.24s] to see guidance rip higher. And to your
[994.32s] point on the dollar, that&#39;s going to
[995.36s] help earnings in the back half. It&#39;s
[996.8s] been weak. I mean, some of the uncert
[999.68s] This sounds awfully bullish here, Tom. I
[1002.399s] mean, some of the uncertainty is
[1003.759s] removed, but we got 90 days. There&#39;s
[1005.759s] still 30% tariffs on Chinese goods
[1008.0s] coming in. There&#39;s still 10% tariffs on
[1010.24s] everything else. You know, these
[1012.639s] companies that came out and pulled their
[1013.92s] forecast, I don&#39;t hear them coming out
[1015.519s] and saying, &quot;Actually, now we have a
[1017.12s] forecast for you.&quot; Right. So, has the
[1020.399s] has the equation change? I mean, how
[1021.839s] much has has the equation for decision
[1024.16s] makers at corporations really changed?
[1026.319s] Yeah. Well, if if we look at things were
[1028.16s] in their worst case a few weeks ago, and
[1030.559s] 2026 earnings still held up above $300
[1034.079s] per share on the S&amp;P 500, which is 18.5
[1036.959s] times next year&#39;s earnings, the 10-year
[1038.72s] average is 18.3 times. So, I would say
[1041.36s] the tariff news has only gotten better
[1043.36s] in the last few weeks. So, if guidance
[1045.199s] was able to h hold up in the worst case
[1047.36s] scenario, as uh companies start to
[1049.84s] report again in the following quarter,
[1051.28s] which were far, they&#39;re not going to
[1052.4s] come out mid quarter and say, &quot;Hey, by
[1053.84s] the way, we did no guidance. Now, we&#39;re
[1055.2s] going to throw some guidance out. Uh,
[1057.2s] but they&#39;ll start to talk to analysts.
[1058.64s] Analysts will start to upgrade. You&#39;re
[1060.48s] seeing it now. All the PE, you know,
[1061.919s] it&#39;s funny seeing these reports from
[1063.679s] different different sellside houses. One
[1066.0s] week they&#39;re saying recession chances
[1068.08s] high. The next week they&#39;re saying no
[1069.84s] recession and they&#39;re just adapting to
[1071.679s] this and companies now are going to come
[1074.08s] off the sidelines. They&#39;ve been paused.
[1075.76s] They&#39;ve just been saying we&#39;re not doing
[1077.44s] anything. We&#39;re not making any
[1078.64s] investments for the last four, six
[1080.08s] weeks. Now, you&#39;re going to see CEO
[1081.919s] confidence, CFO confidence. And by the
[1083.679s] way, what&#39;s so interesting, we had
[1086.0s] record buyback announcements year to
[1088.72s] date? 665 billion. So while hedge funds
[1092.4s] were selling in the hole, guess who was
[1093.84s] buying? Corporations believe in the
[1095.84s] future. Even in the face of all that
[1097.6s] uncertainty, they were putting their
[1098.88s] money to work to buy shares in this is
[1101.28s] going to be a positive thing
[1102.4s] prospectively. Um the other thing I&#39;m
[1104.72s] curious about is additional trade deals.
[1107.76s] None of them are actual deals, by the
[1109.12s] way. They&#39;re all framework. They&#39;re all
[1110.48s] plans to make a deal. Yeah. Well, here
[1112.64s] they&#39;re not details. All I&#39;m asking is,
[1114.799s] are we going to get diminishing returns
[1116.72s] from these announcements going forward?
[1118.88s] I mean, China was really the big one.
[1120.48s] China was
[1123.4s] the the big one. Europe will be very,
[1125.919s] very important. But at the end of the
[1127.76s] day, here&#39;s the thing. If if President
[1129.52s] Trump had come out and said, &quot;We&#39;re
[1131.84s] going to charge everyone 10%.&quot; Okay?
[1134.48s] There&#39;s no way he would have ended up
[1136.08s] with 10%. So, he came out, he threw a
[1138.559s] grenade in the room, he blew up the
[1140.48s] entire system. and he said, &quot;We&#39;re going
[1141.6s] to tariff you 145%. We&#39;re going to
[1143.76s] tariff you 80%.&quot; Now 10% looks like the
[1146.4s] deal of the century and it&#39;s an
[1148.08s] additional three $400 billion into our
[1150.08s] coffers. So uh with that said that we&#39;re
[1153.44s] paying for well that&#39;s questionable
[1157.039s] because you know we had tariffs that
[1158.88s] were put into place in 2018 2019 that&#39;s
[1162.0s] a very different place for inflation.
[1164.0s] you saw diff disinflationary. So like
[1166.4s] washing machines, whirlpool, the price
[1168.4s] went up like literally shortterm for a
[1170.48s] matter of months. 2 years later, the
[1172.32s] price per unit was actually lower. So
[1175.44s] there&#39;s something to be said. I I think
[1177.039s] it&#39;s the perfect balance. You get a
[1179.12s] little rebalance. Look, China wants to
[1181.039s] move to a consumption-led economy by
[1183.6s] 2030. That is an explicit government
[1185.679s] mandate. They want to move to 70%
[1187.6s] consumption just like the rest of the
[1189.52s] developed world. We want to increase our
[1191.919s] manufacturing percentage. we we&#39;re
[1193.919s] already at that level of consumption.
[1195.52s] So, this rebalance is natural and it
[1197.44s] makes sense. I&#39;m very interested in what
[1199.52s] they&#39;re talking about as it relates to
[1200.88s] the currency kind of kind of lowering
[1203.12s] the value of the US dollar because that
[1205.28s] also helps alleviate some of the
[1206.88s] imbalances. There were rumblings earlier
[1208.96s] in the year. Remember the Mara Lago
[1210.64s] accord where they&#39;d have a a a summit
[1213.28s] like they had in the in the mid 80s
[1214.88s] where they de you know devalued the
[1217.28s] dollar. I don&#39;t know that that&#39;s going
[1218.559s] to be part of it per se, but I think
[1220.559s] that&#39;s the trend. We&#39;re going to get a
[1221.76s] counter trend bounce here in the dollar
[1223.44s] because everyone&#39;s bearish on the dollar
[1224.96s] now after everyone was bullish. And then
[1226.96s] we&#39;re probably going to continue lower
[1228.4s] which is going to be great for S&amp;P
[1230.0s] earnings which is going to help
[1231.2s] rebalance the trade and we&#39;re going to
[1233.12s] be okay.
[1235.039s] What could go wrong you like you sound
[1237.6s] like everything is perfect, Tom? Well,
[1239.44s] look, I look at businesses company by
[1241.6s] company. We did a client conference call
[1244.08s] April 7th, okay? And I went through
[1246.88s] every single company. And I went through
[1248.24s] their balance sheet, their liquidity,
[1250.32s] their cash flow, their revenues, and all
[1252.799s] of these things were going up. The only
[1254.32s] thing that had changed is the headlines
[1255.84s] and the price relative to that. Yes,
[1257.919s] huge tariffs would have impacted the
[1259.679s] cash flow. Okay, but you what what&#39;s the
[1261.679s] big risk here? Is there a risk? The big
[1264.32s] risk is you buy companies that don&#39;t
[1266.0s] have a large enough margin of safety.
[1270.799s] The tariff war has brought down so many
[1273.28s] companies 30 40 50% on the fears of the
[1276.559s] worst case scenario. Now that scenario
[1278.48s] is out positioning in cyclicals relative
[1280.72s] to defensives is at all-time lows. So
[1283.84s] it&#39;s it&#39;s got to be what do you buy on
[1285.36s] the surface? The valuation of equal
[1287.2s] weight relative to cap weight is one
[1289.28s] standard deviation below the mean. Your
[1291.52s] money is going to be made finding those
[1293.36s] things that have been hit hardest by
[1294.72s] tariffs. Worst case scenario, no longer
[1296.96s] worst case scenario. these things can
[1298.48s] double over the next two, three, four
[1299.84s] years. Okay. Yeah. Tom Hayes, you&#39;re
[1302.88s] going to stick around. We&#39;re going to do
[1304.32s] more of this. The House Tom Hayes of
[1306.96s] Great Hill Capital still with me here
[1309.039s] because I want to get your take on this
[1310.88s] tax bill, right? Um and the way that
[1313.6s] I&#39;ve been sort of thinking about it is
[1314.96s] that if this didn&#39;t happen, it would be
[1316.32s] a big problem for the markets. Yeah. It
[1318.88s] happening doesn&#39;t seem to necessarily be
[1320.72s] a big catalyst because it&#39;s expected or
[1322.799s] what do you think would be in there that
[1324.4s] would that could move the needle more? I
[1326.96s] think it will move the needle once it&#39;s
[1328.4s] done. It&#39;s going to be pushed through
[1329.36s] with record like yes they got well
[1331.6s] relief corporate tax rates earning the
[1333.679s] impact on earnings power the impact on
[1335.52s] the consumer having more money. Uh so
[1337.52s] this is well but they they&#39;re not going
[1338.799s] to have more money than they do now.
[1340.0s] Right. Waitresses are look uh no tax on
[1343.919s] tips. You you got corporate tax rate.
[1346.0s] You&#39;ve got um we we&#39;re basically
[1348.4s] shifting now from the apocalypse into
[1351.039s] growth and deregulation. Growth and
[1352.64s] deregulation is the happy place. Okay.
[1354.559s] So, welcome to the happy place. We&#39;re
[1356.32s] now focused on growth. Companies can
[1358.08s] start to invest. The tax bill is one
[1359.84s] more uh cherry on the on the cake. Uh
[1362.559s] and and this is going to be the second
[1364.48s] half theme. So, when Trump says stocks
[1367.28s] are going a lot higher, first off, his
[1368.88s] first tweet was right, okay, on April
[1370.72s] 9th. His second tweet last week when
[1372.559s] people were nervous before the UK deal
[1374.4s] was right. Yesterday, he&#39;s in Saudi
[1376.159s] Arabia saying stocks are going a lot
[1377.76s] higher. Um th this is one of the few
[1381.28s] regions of the world right now that has
[1383.52s] an explicit growth program on the plate.
[1388.28s] Deregulation, tax
[1390.12s] cuts, billions upon billions, trillions
[1393.44s] of dollars investment in the United
[1395.36s] States incentivized for these businesses
[1397.039s] going that&#39;s going to create a huge
[1398.159s] amount of jobs. And if you remember
[1399.6s] Trump 1.0, guys who run money like me,
[1402.159s] we did okay. It was a good four years, a
[1404.08s] lot of volatility. We ended up fine.
[1406.159s] Okay. everyday people, middle-class
[1408.799s] working pa class people. If you look at
[1410.48s] the employment rate, real word wages,
[1412.799s] they did better than ever. And I think
[1414.4s] you&#39;re going to see that cubed in this
[1417.28s] Trump 2.0. I think you&#39;re going to see
[1418.799s] the middle class, the upper middle
[1420.24s] class, the lower class, working class do
[1422.72s] exceptionally well. I think, by the way,
[1425.12s] it&#39;s interesting. I think you&#39;re going
[1426.64s] to see a continued outperformance of
[1429.6s] international stocks even despite all of
[1432.24s] this growth programs. US stocks are
[1434.48s] going to do great. International stocks
[1436.32s] are going to start to do well. It&#39;s it&#39;s
[1437.84s] a cycle that happens every 10 to 15
[1439.6s] years. We started it in the first
[1441.039s] quarter of this year. So, it&#39;s about the
[1442.72s] end of the show today. I&#39;m gonna get you
[1444.32s] to say something negative. That&#39;s my
[1445.6s] challenge of the deal. All your markets
[1447.44s] action straight ahead. Stay tuned.
[1448.799s] You&#39;re watching Catalyst.
[1454.159s] Tom Hayes still with me here. So
[1456.32s] interesting call here on the effect that
[1459.279s] more calm has in the markets which for
[1462.559s] many investors is like thank goodness
[1465.039s] but if your options or if you rely on
[1466.64s] options for your business maybe not as
[1468.72s] positive. Yeah. When when volatility
[1470.32s] ticks up you buy CBOE that&#39;s a
[1472.24s] no-brainer. Uh volatility huge crush in
[1475.12s] the last four weeks. Uh so their
[1477.44s] revenues are going to be a little bit
[1478.48s] lighter. Double downgrade it&#39;s a little
[1480.159s] aggressive. It&#39;s such a great business.
[1481.6s] It&#39;s got kind of a monopoly in the
[1483.36s] space. So, I think longterm it&#39;s okay. I
[1485.52s] think short short term I actually like
[1486.88s] the sellside call, which I don&#39;t say
[1488.24s] very often. Oh, interesting. Okay. Um,
[1490.88s] and then also we&#39;re looking at New
[1492.64s] Holdings. That&#39;s the holding company for
[1494.799s] New Bank. Um, and watching that stock.
[1497.36s] It&#39;s a Brazilian digital lender here.
[1499.679s] Um, and uh, it posted a slight miss in
[1502.64s] its adjusted profit for the first
[1504.24s] quarter. The company did see strong
[1505.84s] revenue growth of 40% year-over-year
[1507.76s] during the quarter, but higher spending
[1509.679s] on new clients dragged on its profit.
[1511.52s] The shares were down before. Now they&#39;ve
[1513.679s] turned higher by a little more than 1%.
[1515.36s] It&#39;s among the most valuable lenders in
[1517.36s] Latin America. Warren Buffett&#39;s
[1519.2s] Birkshire Hathaway is among its
[1521.6s] shareholders. That&#39;s usually Tom&#39;s mood
[1523.679s] music uh when he hears that kind of
[1525.76s] thing. Um we&#39;ve talked to the company
[1527.36s] before and it really has seen big
[1529.039s] growth. We also recently talked to
[1530.64s] Marcato Libre, another fintech and
[1532.64s] e-commerce company that&#39;s big in Latin
[1534.64s] America and the theme that they
[1536.32s] emphasize over and over again is just
[1538.24s] adoption. In other words, they&#39;re much,
[1540.72s] you know, they&#39;re not as far along as we
[1542.159s] are here in the US with everyone on
[1543.679s] devices, shopping, banking online, and
[1546.24s] so there&#39;s a lot of upside. Yeah. Well,
[1549.76s] uh, I got rich investing in South
[1552.159s] American banks is something no one&#39;s
[1553.919s] ever said. I I will say this, look,
[1555.919s] they&#39;re growing customers. They&#39;ve got a
[1557.6s] new technology. Buffett owns like a
[1559.279s] sliver. One of his underlings bought it.
[1561.6s] Uh, but as far as it goes, what you saw
[1564.0s] was their credit reserves went up in
[1566.32s] terms of uh expecting bad losses. And
[1568.32s] this is the same story over and over in
[1569.84s] Latin America. Brazil hasn&#39;t benefited
[1572.159s] from the international outperformance
[1573.76s] because of the political climate. So you
[1575.84s] really need to see a change in political
[1577.44s] regime. They&#39;re expanding into Colombia.
[1579.039s] That&#39;s weighing on cost. They&#39;re
[1580.159s] expanding into Mexico. So they have to
[1582.159s] invest a lot. This thing has been kind
[1584.0s] of dead money for years. Everyone said,
[1585.44s] &quot;Well, Buffett bought it. It&#39;s going to
[1586.64s] be great.&quot; Well, Buffett didn&#39;t buy it.
[1588.08s] His his underlings did. And um I I it
[1591.2s] wouldn&#39;t surprise me if they do get the
[1592.72s] growth, if they get the momentum, if all
[1594.32s] the ingredients come together. Uh but
[1596.72s] it&#39;s not there yet. So, for me, it&#39;s a
[1598.32s] pass. Okay. I mean, it&#39;s the stock
[1601.0s] hasn&#39;t I don&#39;t know. I guess it has. It
[1603.84s] is. It had a big run up and now it
[1607.039s] hasn&#39;t. That&#39;s why we&#39;re talking about
[1608.48s] it. Yeah, I guess so. Um, and let&#39;s talk
[1610.96s] about Uber offering a billion dollars of
[1613.039s] exchangeable notes tied to shares of
[1614.64s] self-driving truck company Aurora.
[1616.559s] Aurora was Aurora was one of the first
[1618.159s] autonomous vehicle startups to go
[1619.6s] public, a listing it achieved in 2021.
[1622.0s] Uber was the company and is the
[1623.6s] company&#39;s largest shareholder. Couldn&#39;t
[1625.279s] sell its shares for four years. Aurora
[1627.44s] is a really interesting company. We
[1628.72s] actually had the chance to talk to the C
[1630.4s] CEO recently. Um, and to be clear,
[1632.88s] Aurora doesn&#39;t make the cars, the
[1635.2s] vehicles. It doesn&#39;t even make cars at
[1637.2s] all. Its software is for self-driving
[1639.12s] semi-truckss. And it actually is one of
[1641.12s] the first ones that h actually has um
[1644.0s] trucks using its software on the roads
[1646.08s] in Texas. So, that was a big milestone
[1648.64s] for the company. Uber still owns over
[1651.279s] 300 million shares of it, 23% of the
[1653.36s] stock. But what you get is when you get
[1655.12s] a convertible offering, it can dilute
[1657.039s] the value for existing shareholders. But
[1658.799s] still, Aurora kind of an intriguing, you
[1660.96s] know, we keep talking about Tesla,
[1662.88s] Whimo, D. I mean, this company, it
[1665.84s] software is already driving out there. I
[1667.679s] think this offering is just a way for
[1669.12s] Uber to raise a billion dollars of cash
[1670.72s] without selling the stock. Uh, and
[1672.559s] Aurora doesn&#39;t want to them to dump a
[1674.399s] billion dollars of stock on the market.
[1676.159s] So, uh, this is a great way. It converts
[1678.399s] at a at a 10 to 15% up, uh, into Aurora
[1682.48s] stock. So that means that stock or into
[1684.559s] cash. So that means that stock would be
[1686.08s] pulled away from Uber. So this is, you
[1688.08s] know, it&#39;s a way for them to monetize
[1690.799s] that
[1691.72s] position without destroying the market
[1693.919s] for Aurora and maintaining that
[1695.36s] partnership. So I think it&#39;s a smart
[1696.64s] move by Uber. I think uh Aurora likes it
[1699.2s] and uh and it&#39;s a bet that this could be
[1701.12s] the future because we we do need truck
[1702.88s] drivers and we do need that uh
[1704.32s] logistics. Are you invested in any kind
[1706.88s] of autonomous driving? Is that a theme
[1709.44s] that you&#39;re into? I know you&#39;re sort of
[1711.039s] more on the value side, so I don&#39;t know
[1712.96s] if this appeals to you. I think the
[1715.6s] greatest international value in AI right
[1718.799s] now and one of our largest positions is
[1720.799s] called Alibaba. No one wants it. Yeah.
[1724.399s] No one wants it. It&#39;s up. It&#39;s doubled
[1726.32s] off the lows. People are still not
[1728.32s] talking about it because the Republican
[1730.24s] Senate and House is saying we&#39;re going
[1731.6s] to delist it again. Every two years
[1733.12s] we&#39;re going to delist it. So we own it
[1734.48s] in Hong Kong. They&#39;re going to report
[1735.919s] earnings tomorrow. Okay, you saw JD.
[1738.0s] Earnings are going to be good. This is
[1739.84s] the cheapest way to own AI in the world
[1741.84s] because not only are their models
[1743.6s] beating Deep Seek and beating Open AI,
[1746.559s] but they&#39;re the largest cloud provider.
[1748.399s] And what they say to all these AI
[1749.919s] startups in China, every single one of
[1751.36s] them, we&#39;ll help you out. We&#39;ll give you
[1753.12s] a free sample. We will give you cloud
[1755.52s] computing which you need and you can&#39;t
[1756.96s] afford, you will give us equity. So
[1759.84s] Alibaba is effectively an AI ETF in
[1763.36s] China. They own a piece of all the AI
[1765.52s] startups. So that&#39;s the way I&#39;m playing
[1767.2s] it. So indirectly, I probably have a lot
[1769.039s] of autonomous driving, but I have it
[1771.2s] through something with a huge margin of
[1772.799s] safety, $80 billion of cash on the
[1774.48s] balance sheet, generating $20 billion of
[1776.72s] free cash flow, buying in stock like
[1778.559s] there&#39;s no no tomorrow, and a leader in
[1780.64s] AI. So, oh, and by the way, they&#39;re the
[1782.399s] number one retailer to the middle class.
[1783.76s] So, as the Chinese push, a little bonus,
[1786.24s] they&#39;re a toll taker. Um, that was an
[1788.559s] very adept piv pivot, Tom Hayes, try
[1790.88s] from autonomous driving Alibaba. stock
[1792.72s] is up almost 60% over the last year. So,
[1795.279s] not too shabby on that front either. Um,
[1797.279s] let&#39;s get to some breaking news that was
[1798.96s] crossing the wire. A wave of deals being
[1800.799s] announced amid President Trump&#39;s visit
[1802.399s] to the Middle East. This time it&#39;s
[1803.919s] Boeing. President Trump saying Boeing
[1805.76s] has won its largest ever order in the
[1807.679s] company&#39;s history. Qatar Airways said to
[1810.24s] have purchased 160 aircraft from the US
[1813.039s] company. Um, and um, again, Trump saying
[1816.08s] that this is the total the largest
[1818.159s] Boeing order in its history. Of course,
[1820.88s] there&#39;s other some other plane headlines
[1822.88s] that the president made with a Qatari
[1824.48s] plane, but we&#39;ll leave that aside for
[1826.08s] the moment as that country gives him a
[1828.559s] plane. Um, but um, Tom, Boeing is a
[1832.0s] company you own. Yeah. Company you like.
[1834.24s] This is a big one. Okay. We owned it
[1836.0s] around $150. It dropped down to $129
[1839.039s] with all the tariff barriers and all
[1841.279s] everything else. We bought it like the
[1843.039s] lights were going out. I mean, we have
[1844.72s] because here&#39;s the thing. We bet on
[1846.24s] jockeyies. So, they call me turnaround
[1847.6s] Tom. I like to buy great businesses when
[1849.36s] they&#39;re temporarily marked down. Kelly
[1851.2s] Ortberg ran Rockwell Collins. Okay.
[1853.919s] Defense contractor 7 years forbagger for
[1857.2s] owners. He&#39;s actually an engineer on the
[1860.159s] floor. So it&#39;s it&#39;s nice to have Boeing
[1862.08s] run by a guy who actually goes on the
[1864.08s] floor and knows how planes are put
[1865.84s] together versus a salesman when the
[1867.679s] doors fall off mid-flight. That doesn&#39;t
[1869.36s] work. Okay. So Kelly is going to turn
[1871.84s] the business around. He&#39;s already done
[1873.12s] that. The stock is 129 four weeks ago.
[1875.679s] It&#39;s 200 today. They just got a huge
[1877.36s] order. This is icing on the cake. This
[1879.679s] guy can deliver. They&#39;ll sell some of
[1881.039s] the space business and at at the uh at
[1883.36s] the margins, but they operate in a
[1885.44s] duopoly. It&#39;s like it was hysterical
[1887.279s] when the Chinese said, &quot;We&#39;re not going
[1889.36s] to take your planes during the tariffs.&quot;
[1891.76s] China needs Boeing&#39;s plane like a
[1893.6s] diabetic needs insulin. Okay? I mean,
[1896.399s] they can they can go to Airbus and
[1898.0s] Airbus will say, &quot;We&#39;re so happy to have
[1899.679s] you as a new client. Uh your weight is
[1902.84s] 21 years. Uh how many would you like?&quot;
[1906.0s] And and so now as soon as this was done,
[1908.559s] China went back to Boeing and said, &quot;Can
[1910.0s] we get back in line?&quot; And Boeing said,
[1911.76s] &quot;Yeah, we&#39;ll open the door. We like you
[1913.6s] as a customer.&quot; So China&#39;s back in the
[1915.44s] game. Saudi Arabia&#39;s back in the game,
[1917.6s] and they&#39;re going to build the planes
[1918.799s] better than they&#39;ve ever built them
[1920.0s] because Kelly Orberg actually
[1921.679s] understands the business. Okay. Well,
[1924.08s] hope I hope that&#39;s so for all of our
[1926.0s] stakes who fly on Boeings. Tom Hayes is
[1928.24s] going to stick around with me. We&#39;re
[1929.279s] going to have more on President Trump&#39;s
[1930.64s] deals from the Middle East coming. And
[1932.159s] he wants to ask you a question as well.
[1934.24s] So Muhammad, what do you see as the
[1936.399s] magnitude of the the amount of data
[1938.32s] center centers relative to the rest of
[1940.159s] the world? Uh and and how are they
[1942.0s] cooling them? Uh is it is a key question
[1944.32s] in the Middle East uh moving forward?
[1946.399s] What what do you see as as the future?
[1948.399s] Is it going to be the data center hub of
[1949.84s] the world or is it just going to be a
[1951.2s] major player along alongside the US and
[1953.519s] and other nations? Excellent question. I
[1956.559s] would say I would say the United States
[1958.159s] and China the Gulf is clearly emerging
[1960.559s] as this third feeder of AI power. They
[1964.08s] are willing to be to invest heavily in
[1966.64s] AI infrastructure of energy abundant
[1968.96s] energy to fuel the AI ecosystem is the
[1971.519s] main center uh decisive factor here and
[1974.08s] this is where the Gulf is finding its
[1976.24s] own niche. So if that&#39;s true, then
[1978.96s] effectively the the two winners by
[1981.279s] default have to be the UA, the the uh
[1984.32s] the Middle East and the United States
[1986.64s] because we have effectively unlimited
[1988.32s] access to energy and uh and natural gas
[1990.88s] being the derivative play to to see that
[1993.44s] in the first stages. Is that a fair way
[1995.039s] to think about it? I think it&#39;s a very
[1996.88s] fair way to think about that. I think
[1998.159s] the Gulf countries have been investing
[2000.32s] heavily in building the electricity
[2002.399s] grids around this sort of major hypers
[2005.12s] scale AI infrastructure. I agree with
[2007.279s] you the United States is a clearly ahead
[2009.36s] in the AI race. who owns solar and and
[2012.88s] other types of renewable um generation
[2015.76s] here. And the the changing sort of Tom
[2020.159s] Hay still with me obviously the changing
[2022.399s] um face of what energy generation looks
[2025.039s] like in the United States has been
[2026.24s] really interesting as we&#39;ve seen it
[2027.919s] powered by this data center boom. Yeah,
[2030.08s] I think NRG is interesting. It&#39;s a great
[2032.0s] business. You&#39;ve seen the stock go up
[2033.279s] quite a bit. But the problem is they
[2035.12s] rely on the kindness of strangers. They
[2036.96s] have to go to the regulators every year
[2038.32s] and beg them for price increases. That&#39;s
[2040.72s] the bad news. They&#39;ve got to make all
[2042.24s] this investment in the face of not
[2043.919s] knowing what those price increases are
[2045.279s] going to be. However, they&#39;re going to
[2047.039s] they&#39;re going to boom from this. They&#39;re
[2048.32s] going to continue to boom, but that the
[2049.679s] run is already priced in a lot of that
[2051.359s] good news. Yes. But the difference with
[2052.8s] the rates is when they make those sort
[2054.32s] of out of, you know, they make the side
[2056.72s] deals with the data center operators
[2059.119s] like we&#39;ve seen to some extent, right?
[2060.96s] Microsoft made the deal to reopen the
[2063.04s] reactor at three mile island. you know,
[2065.2s] so I think that&#39;s what they and
[2066.72s] investors are banking on. I think so.
[2068.72s] I&#39;d rather play the feed stock. I always
[2071.04s] try to play the arms dealers, not the
[2072.639s] waring factions. So for me, I&#39;d rather
[2075.28s] play natural gas companies that have
[2077.04s] been left for dead like comtock
[2078.56s] resources. Jerry Jones owns 71% of the
[2081.119s] stock. They&#39;ve got the Hannesville
[2082.48s] shale. And by the way, not only are you
[2084.079s] going to benefit from the unlimited
[2085.44s] demand from the data centers and from
[2087.04s] the utilities for that natural gas, but
[2089.679s] guess what the EU trade deals are going
[2091.52s] to all all be about with the tariffs is
[2093.599s] all going to be you take our natural
[2095.359s] gas, we will lower your tariffs. They&#39;re
[2097.52s] in the Hannesville shale, which is right
[2099.119s] right there where they can ship. So, uh
[2101.28s] so that&#39;s a good way to play. We started
[2103.04s] coming out on that aggressively at $8
[2104.56s] and $9. It&#39;s $23. We think it can double
[2107.04s] again from here. Why is that? Well, uh,
[2109.92s] they have to report to the SEC, uh, all
[2112.72s] energy companies, PV10, proven reserve
[2114.8s] for 10 years. What they don&#39;t report is
[2116.96s] they&#39;ve got 15 excess years of drilling
[2119.52s] that&#39;s not in the price of the stock,
[2121.359s] which is probably double plus from here.
[2123.28s] So, we think this has a long runway
[2125.28s] driven by the AI theme. So, when people
[2127.04s] say, &quot;What are your AI investments?&quot; I
[2129.04s] say, &quot;Well, Alibaba is a derivative
[2130.8s] play.&quot; And I say, &quot;Comm stock
[2132.4s] resources.&quot; And people say, &quot;What do you
[2133.76s] mean?&quot; I said, &quot;Natural gas.&quot; And that&#39;s
[2135.04s] the story. And NRG is going to be an
[2136.72s] equal beneficiary for sure. Right.
[2138.48s] Interesting. Thanks, Tom. Appreciate it.
[2140.72s] Well, all your markets action straight
[2142.24s] ahead. Stay tuned. You&#39;re watching
[2143.98s] [Music]
[2150.92s] Catalysts about how this would all play
[2152.88s] out, this impact of tariffs. Yeah. And
[2154.8s] if we&#39;re going to get more inventory,
[2156.079s] there&#39;s going to be more markdowns,
[2157.2s] which is disinflationary along with gas,
[2159.2s] which means it could be true that Powell
[2161.68s] is too late. He&#39;s 150 basis points too
[2164.48s] restrictive. He&#39;s got to go in June.
[2167.119s] Maybe. Maybe maybe lots of unknowns. I
[2169.28s] like how you made this about pal. Look,
[2172.079s] you got to look through one and two
[2173.2s] quarters. This is a short-term
[2174.4s] bottleneck. AEO is a random an anecdote.
[2177.2s] Uh I think I think well but it&#39;s not the
[2179.28s] only anecdote. There are a lot of other
[2180.8s] retailers where we&#39;re seeing similar
[2182.64s] we&#39;re seeing a huge divergence between
[2184.48s] hard data and soft data. Okay. So on
[2186.48s] balance when we look at retail sales,
[2188.64s] consumers are saying the world is
[2189.839s] ending. They&#39;re depressed. Okay. But
[2191.2s] they&#39;re outspending like there&#39;s no
[2192.32s] tomorrow. If you look at the if you look
[2193.68s] at the actual data, so you have an AEO.
[2196.32s] Could it be their mix was off? You know,
[2198.079s] I&#39;m I&#39;m saying on balance, I agree with
[2199.68s] what you&#39;re saying. Could their
[2200.64s] merchandise not have been exactly what
[2202.72s] consumers wanted? And they even admitted
[2204.48s] that they got a got it a little bit
[2205.839s] wrong in this quarter. Yeah. Lulu had
[2207.68s] the wrong color a couple quarters ago
[2209.359s] and everyone said, &quot;I can&#39;t wear yoga
[2210.72s] pants that are off green.&quot; You know, I
[2212.64s] mean, I only wear purple yoga pants
[2214.96s] personally, but uh but I you know, you
[2217.28s] look at the market&#39;s a discounting
[2218.48s] mechanism. So it&#39;s it a lot of these
[2220.4s] consumer discretionary stocks when you
[2222.32s] look at the positioning relative to
[2223.76s] defensive it&#39;s at record lows people
[2226.32s] this is known right so this is it
[2227.92s] looking in the rearview mirror when we
[2229.52s] look through the front window and we
[2231.28s] look at a better uh tariff climate when
[2233.2s] we look at consumer confidence coming
[2234.88s] back soft data to start to meet the hard
[2237.28s] data I think you&#39;re going to see a boom
[2239.359s] especially the wealth effect with the
[2240.56s] stock market back up is a very very
[2242.4s] constructive thing for the consumer they
[2244.079s] don&#39;t have to worry to look out for
[2245.44s] Yeah. So, you&#39;ll be buying plenty of
[2246.72s] purple yoga plants. That&#39;s right. Thank
[2249.28s] you. Um, of course you&#39;re going to stick
[2251.04s] around. We got Yeah, it it seems like
[2253.28s] international you you want two things in
[2255.28s] play. Number one is a weaker dollar. So,
[2256.96s] that&#39;s helped. I think uh XUS relative
[2259.76s] to the US is outperformance of some 15
[2262.32s] 16% year to date. So now people, this
[2265.119s] was a big theme for us coming into this
[2266.88s] year. How do you see that playing out in
[2269.119s] coming years? Because if you look at,
[2270.4s] you know, zoom out and look at the
[2271.599s] long-term data, these run in normal 10
[2273.68s] to 15 year cycles and we&#39;ve had this
[2275.44s] zero interest rate policy. So large cap
[2277.599s] tech has outperformed the la post great
[2279.52s] financial crisis. That&#39;s over. We&#39;re
[2281.44s] we&#39;re in kind of a normalized interest
[2283.28s] rate environment. So do you see that as
[2285.04s] a favorable environment for the next
[2286.72s] handful of years for international
[2288.0s] relative to the US or are you still king
[2289.92s] US equities? I mean I I think there&#39;s a
[2292.72s] place for both. Just want to get some uh
[2295.359s] final thoughts from Thomas on the US
[2298.16s] dollar and this after there was a story
[2300.16s] today um that Bloomberg reported that
[2302.32s] the US and South Korean in their Korea
[2304.64s] in their discussions over trade had
[2307.359s] brought up currency as a possible lever.
[2310.8s] We did see the dollar pull back
[2312.24s] particularly against the South Korean
[2313.76s] Juan on this. There&#39;s a lot of debate
[2315.839s] over whether a weaker US dollar is a
[2318.88s] good thing or not. Uh it&#39;s going to help
[2321.839s] earnings in the back half of this year
[2323.2s] for sure. that&#39;s already happened. The
[2324.64s] dollar&#39;s been weakening. We&#39;re going to
[2325.76s] get a counter trend bounce because
[2326.96s] everyone&#39;s bearish on the dollar right
[2328.48s] now. Uh, however, the Chinese were
[2330.96s] pretty smart about this tariff
[2332.16s] negotiation because what they
[2333.2s] effectively did was they devalued the
[2334.96s] yuan by 20% ahead of talks. So, it&#39;s
[2337.2s] like, okay, you want to do 20% tariffs,
[2338.88s] we&#39;re kind of flat. It&#39;s fine. Uh, so I
[2341.04s] I I think you&#39;re going to see a trend.
[2342.8s] Uh, there has been a a theme earlier in
[2345.599s] the year. There were rumblings about the
[2347.2s] Mara Lago accord where they would
[2348.64s] devalue the dollar to balance out trade.
[2351.52s] Uh, I think you&#39;re going to see some
[2353.2s] pockets of this. I think the trend for
[2354.96s] the dollar moving forward is going to be
[2356.96s] a little bit lower in the coming years.
[2358.56s] That&#39;s going to help uh S&amp;P earnings.
[2360.64s] That&#39;s going to help our trade
[2361.76s] rebalancing and it&#39;s going to be a
[2363.04s] positive thing all around. We&#39;ll see.
[2365.04s] Tom, thanks so much for being here.
[2366.64s] Appreciate it. That does it for Catalyst
[2368.64s] coming up. And we&#39;re back. And then uh
[2371.04s] the three segments, the panel, you can
[2373.92s] listen to the full one on YouTube or
[2376.079s] again Stephen spent all weekend cutting
[2378.079s] these up to just get the the points
[2380.48s] where I was talking about value versus
[2382.4s] growth. This is important concept and
[2384.8s] context to understand moving forward. If
[2387.04s] you want to listen to the whole thing,
[2388.079s] go to yach uh YouTube uh put in the
[2391.119s] search bar hedge fund tips. By the way,
[2392.88s] while you&#39;re at hedge funtips.com, click
[2394.56s] on terms. This is all opinion, not
[2396.8s] advice. Um, so we&#39;ll listen in here.
[2400.8s] Value growth. What&#39;s the best way to
[2402.64s] play this recovery routine? Uh, first
[2405.04s] quarter we saw value outperform growth
[2406.88s] by 12%. Year-to date it&#39;s only 3%. So
[2409.68s] tech has made a comeback. Uh, I like to
[2412.4s] zoom out and take a longer term view.
[2414.32s] Since
[2415.8s] 1927, if you had invested in value over
[2419.119s] growth, you&#39;ve outperformed by
[2421.88s] 4.4%. Uh, that&#39;s not over that period.
[2424.8s] That&#39;s per every single
[2429.079s] year. What does that mean in terms of
[2431.28s] excess returns? It means that million
[2433.2s] dollars you put in in 1927, you got 68
[2437.52s] million more by being invested in value
[2440.32s] over growth. Now, recency bias, the last
[2442.8s] 15 years, growth has outperformed value.
[2446.04s] Why? Growth always outperforms value
[2449.04s] when you have interest rates in the 1 to
[2451.44s] 2% range. when you&#39;re in three 3% and
[2455.119s] above, value outperforms by 76% of the
[2459.119s] time. And in the years that value
[2461.64s] outperforms growth, on average, it&#39;s by
[2464.56s] 15% per year. So if you look at someone
[2466.96s] like Warren Buffett, who&#39;s outperformed
[2468.8s] the S&amp;P 500 by double, basically 9% uh
[2473.2s] over six decades, the reason is only 3%
[2477.44s] of his ideas made up most of the
[2480.24s] returns. What he did was he avoided the
[2483.599s] massive growth drawdowns like the tech
[2486.96s] wreck, like the nifty50, like the growth
[2490.079s] manas. And by avoiding the mistakes is
[2493.28s] how he put himself in position to
[2495.119s] outperform. There was an article in the
[2496.8s] Wall Street Journal this week, if he
[2498.88s] didn&#39;t give so much money away, he would
[2501.599s] be 87 billion wealthier than Elon Musk.
[2506.16s] $400 billion from compounding money in
[2509.2s] boring companies consistently over time
[2511.92s] throughout cycles. So, uh, I have a view
[2515.04s] and in a little bit I&#39;m going to tell
[2516.4s] you how I really feel.
[2517.96s] Sure. Did that guy retired? Well, look,
[2521.2s] I I think Boeing has been a no-brainer.
[2523.359s] That&#39;s been a duopoly. Uh, that thing
[2525.04s] got down to $129 four weeks ago. We went
[2527.76s] on Barney and we&#39;re pounding the table.
[2529.359s] It&#39;s 210 today. Probably going to 250
[2531.839s] over the next year, year and a half. I I
[2534.0s] think, you know, I think people believe
[2536.24s] that it it&#39;s an eitheror decision.
[2539.52s] Either I&#39;m a growth guy, either I&#39;m a
[2542.079s] value guy. They&#39;re they&#39;re attached at
[2543.76s] the hip. Uh and some of the best value
[2546.4s] stocks I&#39;ve ever bought traded at PE
[2549.04s] multiples above 100. And you say, well,
[2551.52s] how the hell is that possible? Because
[2552.72s] they&#39;re in trough earning cycle and I
[2554.4s] play reversion to the mean. So, so you
[2557.119s] know, earnings might be two cents a
[2558.56s] share. uh and then when they normalize
[2560.96s] to $5 a share that multiple comes down
[2563.04s] to eight. So you have to have kind of a
[2564.96s] holistic view. Now in terms of growth
[2567.44s] versus value looking over 100 years you
[2570.72s] to
[2571.8s] to you you know you look at a company by
[2574.16s] company basis you have to say okay how
[2576.0s] much is priced in okay how much of the
[2577.839s] good news is already priced in and you
[2580.56s] know statistically going back a hundred
[2583.079s] years you have to have the view because
[2585.68s] so many people are trapped in recency
[2587.119s] bias of the last 15 years growth has
[2589.119s] crushed value by by the definition of
[2592.0s] how like M Msei defines it not like
[2594.56s] necessarily how you invest in growth or
[2596.079s] how I invest in value because there&#39;s
[2597.68s] like a lot of nuance to that. Um, but in
[2601.839s] terms of cost of capital and what it
[2603.76s] takes to fund these growth ideas and
[2606.88s] these startups and when capital becomes
[2608.48s] available, you saw the VC boom postcoid
[2611.52s] when money was free, you saw the VC
[2614.0s] collapse in in 2022. Uh, so I I would
[2618.079s] just say price is what you pay, value is
[2620.0s] what you get. uh to take an all-in
[2623.2s] growth only point of view in this
[2625.839s] environment with recency bias. Well,
[2627.52s] that&#39;s what&#39;s worked for the last 15
[2628.88s] years. You must you really need to to
[2632.96s] take you must have an outlook that rates
[2635.52s] are going back down to zero or 1% or or
[2638.72s] maybe even 2%. Uh and that might might
[2641.68s] certainly happen. Okay. Uh but we&#39;re
[2644.4s] more in the camp of like 3 to four and a
[2646.96s] half% and odds are 76% of the time we&#39;re
[2650.24s] going to outperform. Now we&#39;re not just
[2651.76s] resting on our laurels like buy a value
[2653.76s] ETF and hope for the best. I do a lot of
[2655.76s] turnarounds which is different. You know
[2657.28s] when you buy uh Boeing when it&#39;s
[2659.599s] dislocated 66% and they operate in a
[2662.4s] duopoly. You know it&#39;s not a hard
[2664.4s] decision. You don&#39;t have to sit up at
[2665.76s] night and say I wonder if Boeing is
[2667.119s] going to work. I mean you know uh you
[2668.88s] could go to Airbus and wait 20 years for
[2670.56s] your next plane. I thought it was
[2671.92s] hysterical when the Chinese uh pulled
[2674.16s] their orders from Boeing over tariffs.
[2676.24s] The Chinese need Boeing planes like a
[2678.079s] diabetic needs insulin. I mean, it it
[2680.16s] was just completely hysterical. It&#39;s
[2681.76s] like, okay, go to Airbus, wait 21 years.
[2684.0s] Oh, you can go to Comarmac. Uh, good
[2686.24s] luck flying on those planes. They
[2687.76s] delivered 13 last year. Uh, you can&#39;t
[2690.48s] make this stuff up. So, uh, Mike and I,
[2693.359s] I think, uh, agree on a lot more fronts
[2696.56s] than than is apparent. uh and we also
[2698.8s] disagree on some but I have growth
[2700.48s] stocks as I define in terms of fast
[2702.88s] earnings growth maybe I&#39;ll pay a lower
[2704.72s] multiple I believe in the technology
[2706.56s] story I just I just look at what am I
[2709.119s] willing to pay for certain aspects of
[2710.72s] that story uh and I have one of the the
[2713.119s] cheapest most incredible AI plays uh in
[2715.28s] the world at a very low price which Mike
[2717.44s] might might ask me or you might have to
[2718.64s] stick around till tomorrow to find out
[2720.64s] I&#39;ll just I&#39;ll interject I don&#39;t I don&#39;t
[2722.48s] want like everyone&#39;s looking in the
[2724.48s] space that I&#39;m looking at but we&#39;re
[2725.92s] looking at it grow because of the
[2727.119s] recency Yeah. Which
[2729.4s] mean I know we&#39;ve kind of already talked
[2731.599s] about one, so I guess besides Boeing,
[2733.92s] what else your top name? Yeah, I like uh
[2737.119s] two names that I&#39;ve actually presented
[2738.72s] at the money show that are up a lot
[2740.48s] since then. Uh one was Alibaba. So that
[2743.359s] gets two things going. So to to bet on
[2746.56s] international, you have to believe that
[2748.0s] the trend of the dollar in the
[2749.68s] intermediate term is going lower. You
[2751.599s] look at the cycles for the last 40
[2752.8s] years, it looks a lot like value. If you
[2754.8s] overlay value growth relative to
[2756.4s] interest rates, it&#39;s a pretty regular
[2757.839s] cycle. If you overlay international
[2759.52s] versus US, uh relative to weak dollar is
[2762.96s] stronger international. So this gets
[2764.48s] value and uh international in one
[2767.119s] package. Alibaba, it is the cheapest way
[2769.52s] to play AI in the world, trading at 13
[2771.76s] times forward earnings. Earnings are
[2773.76s] underestimated at 12 13 times next year.
[2777.04s] Um they have the fastest uh models
[2780.24s] against Deepseek, against OpenAI. that
[2782.48s] recent data came out this week. Uh they
[2784.88s] also have a piece of every single
[2787.599s] effectively every single AI startup in
[2790.319s] China because they come to them and they
[2792.0s] say we need compute power. They&#39;re the
[2793.76s] leader in the cloud business. Uh and
[2795.599s] they say no problem. We&#39;ll give it to
[2796.88s] you for free. Oh, by the way, you&#39;re
[2798.4s] going to give us equity in your
[2799.52s] business. So there are a lot of thousand
[2801.52s] baggers in the in that equity that&#39;s not
[2803.2s] even priced into the stock. Uh Tao and
[2805.839s] T-Mol, they are a toll taker on the
[2807.839s] Chinese middle class. They&#39;ve been
[2808.96s] pumping stimulus for the last nine
[2810.56s] months. They&#39;re going to do more now
[2812.0s] that the tariff thing is over. Um,
[2814.4s] revenues were up 12% year-on-year. This
[2816.48s] is a monster business. 40% of Chinese
[2819.44s] e-commerce goes through Alibaba. It&#39;s a
[2821.2s] play, a leverage play on that recovery.
[2823.119s] Their international iss growing at 20%.
[2825.359s] They&#39;ve got 60 some odd billion dollars
[2827.68s] in net cash. They bought 5% of the float
[2830.16s] in in the last 12 months. So, uh, that&#39;s
[2832.64s] one I like. And then there&#39;s one that I
[2835.359s] talked about on on this stage then when
[2837.04s] it was uh uh I mean we initiated our
[2840.16s] position at $5. I think we talked about
[2842.0s] it on stage at seven or eight dollars.
[2843.52s] It&#39;s called Cooper Standard. Uh this is
[2845.839s] an auto supply company. They do the
[2847.52s] rubber ceilings around the doors and
[2849.04s] windows. Uh and they do fluid transfer
[2851.359s] systems. It is a leverage play on the
[2853.44s] recovery of US AutoSAR. Trump has in the
[2856.56s] tax bill. He&#39;s going to try to make
[2857.839s] interest rates uh car loans
[2860.0s] taxdeductible. Whether that goes through
[2861.839s] or not, the average car on the road is
[2863.44s] 13.5 years. You don&#39;t want to play the
[2866.56s] waring factions GM and Ford because it&#39;s
[2868.96s] going to be a race to the bh bottom in
[2870.88s] terms of incentives and volumes in terms
[2873.359s] of margin compression. You want to play
[2874.8s] the arms dealers, the auto parts
[2876.88s] suppliers that have been left for dead
[2878.4s] in the last two years when SAR got down
[2880.24s] to 152. Uh this has been a fiveagger for
[2882.8s] us. We think it&#39;s going to double again
[2884.16s] from here and probably more than that if
[2885.92s] they get up to normalized $7 uh a share
[2888.88s] of earnings, which they did at the last
[2890.319s] SAR peak in 2017. So, those are my two
[2894.079s] picks. If you had come to past money
[2896.0s] shows, you&#39;ve made a lot of money.
[2897.28s] Boeing&#39;s up 60% year to date, give or
[2899.44s] take. Uh and, uh and it&#39;s going a lot
[2902.0s] higher. So, um that&#39;s what we like. And
[2904.48s] by the way, to speak about uh Buffett,
[2907.04s] yes, Apple has uh done a huge amount of
[2908.96s] his returns, but his entry point in
[2911.76s] 2016, it was trading about 14 times
[2914.0s] earnings, and he benefited from multiple
[2916.24s] expansion, buybacks, and all that stuff.
[2917.92s] So, he bought a great quality business
[2919.76s] at a reasonable price. And that&#39;s where
[2921.68s] we agree it&#39;s like price relative to
[2924.559s] earnings growth. uh um and um uh I I
[2928.96s] just think it&#39;s a very exciting time
[2930.16s] right now to to be in equity markets and
[2932.24s] and to participate because uh I think I
[2935.599s] think Trump is right. He was right about
[2937.44s] the bottom of the market on April 9th
[2939.04s] when he put out that tweet now&#39;s the
[2940.4s] time to buy stocks and I think he was
[2941.839s] right last week when he said America&#39;s
[2943.44s] going to boom. I should have asked you
[2945.04s] this, John. Actually, the Baba Bada
[2947.599s] Cooper, what&#39;s the ticker again? Uh CPS
[2949.92s] Cooper&#39;s name. Let me put a caveat on
[2952.0s] Baba. We&#39;ve switched all of our Baba
[2954.96s] Holdings into Hong Kong Holdings. So, if
[2957.44s] you have like Interactive Brokers, you
[2958.96s] can call your brokerage and just swap
[2960.4s] them out. It&#39;s an 8 to1 exchange rate
[2962.559s] because the currency rate is is fixed.
[2964.72s] Uh that&#39;s a hedge because they were
[2967.04s] throwing that out there in the
[2968.4s] negotiations with China, the dlisting.
[2970.319s] They already went through the PCAOB two
[2972.319s] years ago, but as a fiduciary just to
[2974.96s] manage that risk, why take the risk if
[2976.64s] you don&#39;t have to? We own it in Hong
[2978.48s] Kong under ticker 9988. We do have a
[2981.599s] bunch of US derivatives which were just
[2983.52s] willing to assume that quote unquote
[2985.28s] D-listing risk. I&#39;d assign maybe less
[2987.92s] than 15% probability, but it&#39;s not
[2990.0s] nothing. Rick Scott is kind of
[2991.68s] interested in that and the new SEC chair
[2993.839s] is interested in that. Um the only one
[2996.64s] that that would torch if they do that
[2998.64s] and it&#39;s not polit politically feasible
[3000.8s] if they delicit they torch $800 billion
[3003.28s] of US investor capital. The Chinese
[3004.96s] don&#39;t care. They&#39;d be laughing all the
[3006.079s] way to the bank. It&#39;s like we don&#39;t own
[3007.599s] US ADRs so have at it. think about yeah
[3010.8s] I I would just add one thing there&#39;s the
[3012.88s] the massive trend the parabolic move is
[3015.2s] in no marktomarket so why this has all
[3018.0s] grown so much whether private equity
[3020.24s] whether private credit is because the
[3022.24s] pensions can come in and and they all
[3024.48s] get to keep their jobs because in stocks
[3026.4s] it goes like this but it trends up if
[3028.16s] you got got the right stocks with
[3029.68s] private credit you get no marks until
[3031.92s] you get one mark down to zero and they
[3034.8s] collect fees holding it up to this level
[3037.28s] even if there&#39;s deterioration under the
[3039.599s] surface. So, uh, I kind of like to have
[3042.319s] mark tomarkets because then you can see
[3044.0s] problems before they show up before you
[3045.76s] get the full mark to market and you&#39;re
[3047.92s] out. So, I agree with Louis. If I had to
[3050.16s] think about something that would worry
[3051.44s] me, that would be the pocket that would
[3053.119s] that would be of concern. So to the
[3054.96s] condensed version and we&#39;re back and
[3058.319s] then uh this was my first keynote uh on
[3062.96s] Saturday talking about market outlook
[3066.079s] second half and three ways to play the
[3068.8s] housing recovery and why the housing
[3070.4s] recovery is actually going to happen
[3071.92s] which is non consensus. Uh, so you
[3075.119s] definitely want to listen in here.
[3077.2s] Founder, chairman, and managing
[3079.28s] commanding member of Greyjo Capital.
[3081.359s] Greyjo is a long equity manager based in
[3083.839s] New York City. Uh, if you don&#39;t follow
[3086.079s] his other work, I suggest you do. He
[3087.92s] publishes timely stock market commentary
[3090.16s] at hedge fund tips. Uh, his video cast,
[3093.2s] podcast, all kinds of multimedia, social
[3095.68s] media in addition to what you see from
[3097.599s] them on Fox Business and other networks.
[3099.68s] Uh, interestingly enough, prior to
[3100.88s] starting his own garden, he worked with
[3102.079s] Formall Capital. Uh you might be
[3103.92s] familiar with them or book and movie.
[3107.599s] Please welcome. All
[3110.28s] right. Thank you very
[3113.64s] much. How&#39;s everyone doing? Have you
[3116.96s] enjoyed the week so far? Yes. Good. Uh
[3120.64s] anyone have a favorite uh speaker or
[3123.52s] section so far they want to
[3125.88s] share? Favorite part of the week?
[3129.68s] Tom Lee. Tom Lee. Yeah, I like Tom a
[3131.76s] lot. He&#39;s he&#39;s great great. Anyone else
[3134.96s] favorite section? Nobody said the water
[3138.0s] reception.
[3141.599s] All right, we have a lot to cover in a
[3143.28s] short amount of time, so let&#39;s get to
[3145.119s] it. Uh Mike covered most of my
[3147.68s] background. I have my own firm, Great
[3149.599s] Hill Capital. It&#39;s based in New York
[3151.2s] City. Uh prior to that, who saw the big
[3153.839s] short movie? Okay. I worked for the guy
[3156.8s] played by Brad Pitt. He is four times
[3160.559s] more intelligent than Brad Pitt and half
[3162.64s] as handsome. Let&#39;s just leave it there.
[3165.319s] Um, prior to that, I was with a firm
[3168.319s] called Bedford Oak Adviserss. The
[3170.079s] principal was friends with Buffett for
[3171.76s] 40 years. Uh, we would go out to Omaha
[3174.88s] every single year and uh, see the wizard
[3177.839s] uh, which was absolutely amazing. So, I
[3180.0s] grew up in the New York value mafia
[3183.119s] going to idea lunches with Mario
[3185.119s] Gabelli, Lee Coopermanman, uh, and
[3187.76s] people who underwrite securities as if
[3191.52s] they were going to write buy the entire
[3194.24s] business. When they buy one share, they
[3196.8s] think about, would I be willing to buy
[3198.8s] the whole company? And that&#39;s kind of
[3200.16s] the framework that I live. When I buy a
[3202.8s] share of stock, it&#39;s not that the price
[3205.28s] goes up. It&#39;s predominantly if JP Morgan
[3211.04s] was going to give me unlimited
[3213.079s] financing to debt financing to buy the
[3215.92s] whole business with the one catch, I was
[3219.68s] the equity and it had to be 100% of my
[3222.48s] net worth. So, if it worked out, I would
[3225.2s] make huge amounts of money on on my
[3226.96s] wealth. If it didn&#39;t work out, JP Morgan
[3229.28s] gets the business and I&#39;m completely
[3230.64s] wiped. And unless that I pass that
[3233.52s] filter with a yes, I don&#39;t buy one
[3237.04s] single share because as Buffett said,
[3238.96s] rule number one, don&#39;t lose money. Rule
[3241.52s] number
[3242.52s] two, don&#39;t forget rule number one. Okay.
[3246.48s] The other thing I did at Bedford Oak
[3248.44s] Advisors, I was placed as COO of a
[3252.24s] public company we had. My job was to go
[3254.72s] out and find an asset management
[3256.72s] business to buy. So I interviewed over a
[3259.68s] hundred different asset managers. I saw
[3262.16s] every single strategy under the sun.
[3263.76s] Growth, value, momentum, fixed income.
[3266.0s] And I saw what was durable, what worked,
[3268.4s] what outperformed over time, and what
[3270.72s] was fad and flash in the pan and blew up
[3273.119s] and etc. So that shaped my philosophy
[3276.8s] just learning from hundreds of years of
[3279.04s] others experience of what worked, what
[3281.04s] didn&#39;t, and what was durable.
[3284.24s] Uh we run a long short equity strategy
[3286.4s] in separately managed account format for
[3289.359s] accredited investors and qualified
[3290.88s] institutions. And we do have the number
[3292.8s] one ranked podcast in the hedge fund
[3294.72s] category named hedge fund tips with Tom
[3296.48s] Hayes. Uh we give ideas, we answer
[3299.28s] questions directly from the audience and
[3301.28s] not just like yeah bye bye bye don&#39;t
[3303.28s] don&#39;t buy. We go through the balance
[3305.04s] sheet, income statement, cash flow. We
[3307.839s] really do a a good enough analysis that
[3310.16s] you can make a decision whether it it
[3312.0s] warrants doing further work or you can
[3313.76s] just take a pass. Uh our core philosophy
[3318.079s] is from Warren Buffett and that is great
[3321.52s] investment opportunities come around
[3323.2s] when excellent companies are surrounded
[3325.92s] by unusual circumstances that cause the
[3329.119s] stock to be misappraised. And I&#39;m going
[3331.52s] to be giving you three what we feel are
[3334.839s] aggressively misappraised stocks today.
[3338.0s] We love misappraised stocks. Okay. Um so
[3343.52s] we profit buying on weakness and selling
[3346.079s] on strength. This is driven by deep
[3348.48s] research and the belief that the greater
[3350.48s] price
[3351.64s] dislocation reduces risk. What do most
[3354.559s] people say when the price goes
[3356.28s] down? Don&#39;t buy it. It&#39;s risky. Okay.
[3360.319s] Okay. And actually, the lower it goes,
[3361.92s] if it&#39;s a durable business with cash
[3363.599s] flows and a stable balance sheet, the
[3366.4s] risk is actually coming out because
[3368.24s] you&#39;re buying that stream of future cash
[3370.24s] flows at a lower price. Okay? Sometime,
[3373.2s] you know, when they come down a lot,
[3374.559s] it&#39;s because it had been priced for
[3377.119s] perfection. And you heard a lot of
[3379.28s] different names this week where they&#39;re
[3381.599s] kind of pricing in excessive
[3384.559s] expectations about what&#39;s going to
[3386.079s] happen in the next 5 to 10 years. stocks
[3388.319s] trading at 100 times sales, stocks
[3390.24s] trading at 50 times earnings. And what I
[3394.0s] found from living through many cycles,
[3395.44s] and I&#39;m a little older than I look, is
[3398.359s] that often times those companies do
[3402.92s] fulfill the incredibly amazing
[3406.44s] promises. The problem is is at the point
[3409.52s] at which you bought it, when it was
[3411.68s] headlines every single day, the market
[3414.079s] had already priced that in. So you&#39;re
[3416.64s] late to the party. So then if it&#39;s even
[3418.28s] 1% below excessively high expectations,
[3421.92s] the stock can fall 50%. And that&#39;s why
[3424.559s] you you need to be pretty careful. Uh
[3426.72s] the other thing I see is people who buy
[3428.64s] those high flyers and get it right and
[3431.92s] they keep going uh not on the basis of
[3434.799s] any underlying
[3435.96s] fundamentals. It&#39;s gambling and they
[3438.0s] give it back to the casino sooner or
[3440.0s] later because they&#39;re like, &quot;Wow, I was
[3441.52s] so brilliant. That went up 5x. I just
[3443.599s] bought it when it was high and it went
[3444.96s] higher and all these suckers came in
[3446.319s] after me. I&#39;m going to do it again. And
[3448.88s] then maybe they get lucky again because
[3450.559s] you&#39;re in a bull market. We&#39;re all smart
[3452.0s] in a bull market, right? Uh and then
[3454.799s] that third one just completely cleans
[3456.64s] their clock because there was no
[3458.319s] framework. There was no sound
[3459.68s] fundamental framework that they could
[3461.119s] lean on uh to to
[3463.88s] outperform. Okay. Now, since we do
[3467.319s] turnarounds, when a stock falls 50, 60,
[3470.72s] 70,
[3471.88s] 80%. The market&#39;s telling you something.
[3474.24s] In most cases, in many cases, that stock
[3477.52s] deserves to be down. And the market is
[3479.28s] telling you that that business may cease
[3481.119s] to exist. Okay? So, it&#39;s not just buying
[3484.24s] stocks that are down because the price
[3485.68s] is down. It&#39;s buying down because it&#39;s a
[3488.24s] temporary impairment. And that&#39;s why we
[3490.799s] tend to favor businesses that have been
[3492.559s] around for many years, if not decades,
[3496.16s] and we&#39;ve seen how they operate through
[3498.24s] cycles. And we&#39;ve determined whether or
[3501.2s] not that moat is durable. Is it a fad or
[3504.16s] is this a secular grower that every
[3506.64s] handful of years, you know, you go to a
[3508.559s] recession or you go to a sector trough
[3511.119s] and they always come out of it because
[3512.88s] there&#39;s no real competition. Those are
[3514.96s] the type of businesses that we love. So,
[3516.96s] first thing you need to do if you&#39;re
[3518.16s] buying stocks that are down a lot is uh
[3521.68s] and I know this is foreign because
[3522.96s] everyone today this weekend talked to
[3524.48s] you about buying stocks that are already
[3525.839s] up a lot
[3528.04s] is do can they meet their upcoming debt
[3531.119s] obligations? Do they have enough free
[3533.04s] cash flow to service the debt? When is
[3535.28s] the maturity of those debt instruments?
[3537.599s] Okay. And if you can get comfort that
[3539.68s] look, they&#39;ve got three, four years of
[3541.52s] runway, they&#39;re going to figure it out.
[3543.359s] they&#39;re going to turn around or the
[3544.64s] cycle itself is going to take care of
[3546.16s] it. Uh then you&#39;re golden. Next is is
[3549.119s] the moat durable? Does the company have
[3551.92s] a sustainable competitive advantage? And
[3554.4s] do they have a history of performing
[3555.76s] well through through economic cycles? So
[3558.72s] I don&#39;t like one that&#39;s hasn&#39;t been
[3560.48s] through any real tests. That worries me
[3562.72s] because uh I I don&#39;t know what&#39;s going
[3565.839s] to happen. I like just seeing ones that
[3567.359s] have a natural rhythm. I can see the
[3569.68s] trends of the free cash flow over time.
[3571.28s] I can see the trends of the revenue over
[3573.119s] time. I can see the trends of the
[3574.88s] earnings over time. I can see the
[3576.319s] balance sheet over time. I can see the
[3578.48s] share count over time. Uh and that leads
[3581.2s] to the next one which is
[3583.48s] management. Do they prioritize
[3585.68s] shareholder value? Uh are their
[3588.319s] incentives aligned with shareholders?
[3589.839s] Are they issuing themselves a ton of
[3591.359s] stock and diluting me, making my
[3594.24s] uh uh slice in the pie smaller at their
[3598.079s] own benefit, or do they respect equity?
[3600.559s] Are they buying shares in? Is the share
[3602.96s] count going down? Is my slice of the pie
[3605.92s] getting bigger without putting more
[3608.72s] money into the investment? That&#39;s the
[3610.96s] type of management I like. They respect
[3613.599s] equity. They&#39;re not doing equity
[3615.2s] offerings and diluting people and
[3616.799s] screwing your position for their own
[3619.04s] benefit because all they care about is
[3620.4s] their salary. And that&#39;s very common in
[3622.559s] the smaller stocks, in the promoted
[3624.319s] stocks, in the high-flying stocks. You
[3626.64s] have to be careful. And then finally, is
[3628.559s] there a near-term catalyst, a
[3630.0s] significant catalyst that could unlock
[3632.0s] value? I like to bet on jockeyies. I
[3634.96s] like to have a turnaround CEO who has a
[3638.88s] past track track record of
[3641.4s] success. Um, they could spin off
[3643.92s] divisions. They could sell non-core
[3645.68s] assets to raise cash and pay down debt
[3648.559s] to give them three years of runway to
[3650.24s] turn around. These are critically
[3651.92s] important for turnaround situations. Uh,
[3654.72s] which we just absolutely love to do
[3656.64s] because you can with regularity double
[3659.44s] and triple and quadruple your money in
[3661.52s] great businesses in a reasonable time
[3663.839s] horizon of two, three, four years and
[3666.319s] make a significant IRRa. So, we&#39;re
[3669.839s] effectively
[3671.24s] underwriting public securities where
[3674.0s] most people just get hypnotized by the
[3676.0s] price movements in the short term as if
[3678.24s] we were buying the whole business. So
[3679.599s] like private equity in the public
[3681.76s] markets type of framework
[3684.839s] analysis.
[3686.44s] Okay, here. So what&#39;s our edge? Okay,
[3689.68s] anyone can buy cheap stocks. Every time
[3691.92s] you purchase a stock, someone else is
[3693.52s] selling. And you know the funny part is
[3695.52s] you both think you&#39;re smart. Okay, so we
[3698.24s] believe we have two key advantages.
[3699.76s] First and foremost, our time horizon. We
[3702.48s] take a longer term view. Most people are
[3705.52s] thinking in days, weeks, and months.
[3708.0s] We&#39;re thinking in years. Our average
[3709.92s] holding period is 12 uh 12 12 months up
[3712.64s] to five years. Some double and triple
[3715.28s] much faster than we expect. Some take a
[3717.52s] little bit longer. Um but over a
[3720.16s] portfolio of 8 to 12 stocks, we run a
[3722.319s] concentrated portfolio. Uh there have
[3725.119s] been very few people to ever outperform
[3727.359s] with more than 15 stocks. Um so that&#39;s
[3731.2s] how we run it and we take patience and
[3733.92s] we do we don&#39;t use leverage. So, we&#39;re
[3736.64s] not getting margin calls. We&#39;re not
[3738.48s] getting stopped out. We&#39;re not getting
[3741.119s] uh uh phased out by short-term headlines
[3744.48s] because the price moves 4% in the
[3746.48s] pre-market. And we&#39;re like, &quot;Whoa, what
[3748.0s] does everyone else know that we don&#39;t?&quot;
[3749.68s] We just go back. We look at the cash
[3751.359s] flow statement. We look at their uh
[3753.92s] revenue growth. We look at their
[3755.2s] earnings growth. We say they don&#39;t know
[3756.559s] anything. They&#39;re just responding to
[3757.92s] headlines. Should we add to the
[3759.2s] position? Should we take this the shares
[3761.2s] off their hand? And finally,
[3764.079s] temperament. the ability to drown out
[3765.92s] the short-term noise, avoid being swayed
[3768.4s] by Mr. Market&#39;s emotional up and downs,
[3771.04s] and uh like we always say, Wall Street
[3773.92s] is the only place when they hold a
[3775.599s] clearance sale, everyone runs out of the
[3778.16s] store. You know, Walmart clearance sale
[3780.72s] on TVs, people are, you know, tripping
[3782.64s] over each other to get in the store.
[3784.4s] Wall Street market&#39;s down 10%, 20%,
[3787.04s] everyone&#39;s like, &quot;Please take my stock.&quot;
[3788.96s] And we&#39;re in the business of helping
[3790.319s] people out in those scenarios. Uh so
[3792.96s] theme entering 2025 last we anticipated
[3796.48s] a big rotation coming into 2025. Uh you
[3799.44s] can go back to our podcast if you go to
[3801.88s] youtube.com type in hedge fund tips with
[3804.319s] Tom Hayes. Just pick a date. You can see
[3806.24s] what we were saying. And our big theme
[3808.079s] was get out of MAG7. Okay. And we
[3811.119s] started to do so last summer. Um why?
[3815.359s] Not because of some technical chart
[3817.839s] because earnings were decelerating and
[3820.0s] they were fully priced. Okay, so their
[3822.48s] earnings growth the last two years have
[3824.48s] been over 30%. Uh 36% it&#39;s dropping to
[3828.799s] 16% this year and 18% while the rest of
[3833.359s] the market the unmagnificent 493 the
[3836.4s] earnings growth is
[3839.4s] accelerating. So what would you rather
[3841.92s] have? A group of stocks whose earnings
[3845.92s] growth rate is cut in half and the
[3848.079s] multiple is twice the market or a group
[3851.28s] of stocks where the earnings growth is
[3853.88s] accelerating and the multiple on those
[3856.96s] earnings is below the market. The former
[3859.2s] or the
[3860.52s] latter? The latter, right? Okay. More
[3863.68s] earnings growth, less money. That&#39;s what
[3866.0s] we did and that&#39;s what you absolutely
[3868.079s] saw uh the first
[3870.52s] quarter huge
[3872.839s] outperformance S&amp;P
[3876.44s] lags. So you had
[3879.4s] uh you also had an outperformance both
[3882.48s] of the unmagnificent 493 to the
[3885.359s] magnificent 7 and you had a massive
[3887.72s] outperformance of international over US
[3890.64s] stocks. Okay. The last time you saw that
[3893.599s] uh you had a period of seven years of
[3895.52s] dramatic outperformance. You also saw an
[3897.28s] outperformance of value versus growth
[3900.48s] and that&#39;s going to continue. We&#39;ve had
[3901.839s] a bounce in tech in the last few weeks.
[3904.16s] Uh our view based on underlying
[3906.24s] earnings, they can trade to the top of
[3908.24s] the range, but I think the real money is
[3909.92s] going to be made under the surface in
[3911.52s] the unmagnificent 493 in international
[3914.72s] relative to US and in value relative to
[3918.24s] growth. And uh that was a very unpopular
[3922.16s] opinion in the third and fourth quarter.
[3924.4s] As Rob knows, he&#39;s been listening to the
[3926.24s] podcast for three years. Give stand up.
[3928.079s] Give him a
[3929.0s] hand. Rob has been uh so uh came out to
[3934.48s] see us.
[3936.52s] And the other thing you have to keep in
[3938.799s] mind, and I shared with it
[3940.76s] yesterday, zero interest rate policy was
[3943.599s] the exception, not the rule.
[3945.92s] So the last 15 years, everything that&#39;s
[3948.4s] worked has been all about growth over
[3950.839s] value. In a normalized environment,
[3954.48s] uh, anything when the 10-year yield is
[3958.0s] over
[3959.0s] 3%. Value outperforms growth 76% of the
[3962.559s] time. When the 10-year yield is over 4%
[3965.52s] like it is right now, value outperforms
[3968.079s] growth 86% of the time. And as I shared
[3970.88s] on the panel yesterday, over the last
[3973.2s] since 1927, basically last h 100red
[3975.72s] years, value even including the
[3978.72s] aberration of the last 15 years, value
[3980.88s] has outperformed growth by 4.4% per
[3984.559s] year. So if you put in a million in
[3986.079s] value and a million in growth in 1927,
[3988.4s] you have 68 million more dollars by
[3990.799s] having chosen value over growth. And
[3993.599s] basically it&#39;s because you avoid the
[3995.359s] huge draw downs like the nifty50 crash
[3997.839s] in the 70s, like the tech wreck in the
[4000.2s] 2000s, like the mini tech wreck in 2022.
[4004.0s] Anyone remember that? Few of you.
[4007.319s] Okay.
[4009.559s] Um Okay. So we we&#39;re seeing a record
[4012.799s] rotation out of US stocks into
[4015.039s] international. The last time you saw
[4017.359s] that type of rotation out, huge
[4019.68s] outperformance for the next seven years.
[4021.44s] So we&#39;ll get fits and starts here in the
[4023.359s] beginning. But this is a real trend and
[4025.76s] this is a function of what you&#39;ll also
[4028.079s] see is the weakness in the dollar
[4030.079s] persist in line with
[4032.52s] this value out outperform growth mag 7
[4036.72s] to lag seven. You can see the earnings
[4039.2s] growth on the chart on the right side
[4041.92s] from 36% earnings growth last year. The
[4045.039s] other 493 stocks was only 4%. This year
[4047.839s] that&#39;s cut in half. So if the earnings
[4051.039s] growth decelerates cuts in half, does it
[4052.96s] make sense that the stocks went down? Of
[4056.119s] course. Okay, that&#39;s the most important
[4058.64s] thing. And people say all the mag 7 was
[4061.359s] down because of tariffs. Most of them
[4064.16s] are actually unaffected by tariffs.
[4066.079s] Okay, if you look business by business.
[4067.76s] So it has to do with earnings growth.
[4069.599s] And what&#39;s happened? The unmagnificent
[4071.72s] 493 had 4% earnings growth last year.
[4074.96s] They&#39;re up to 8% this year, 13% next
[4077.44s] year. So their earnings growth is going
[4078.88s] up, multiples down, that&#39;s starting to
[4080.72s] go up, etc. So you want to skate to
[4082.72s] where the puck is going, not the ones
[4085.2s] that are in the headline that have
[4086.48s] already gone up 5x that people are
[4088.319s] saying now is the time to buy. The ones
[4090.4s] that no one&#39;s paying attention to. The
[4092.48s] best example of that this year was
[4097.319s] Boeing. No one talked about Boeing. No
[4100.0s] one wanted to touch Boeing at 12 four or
[4103.359s] five weeks ago was $129.
[4106.0s] I mean, we couldn&#39;t buy it fast enough.
[4108.88s] I mean, we did a special call with
[4110.239s] clients. We said, &#39;We haven&#39;t asked you
[4112.239s] to send in money since October 2022.
[4116.239s] Okay, that was the bottom of the tech
[4118.08s] wreck when you couldn&#39;t give away tech
[4119.679s] stocks. And for those of you who think I
[4121.44s] only buy boring old manufacturing
[4123.679s] businesses, you know what we were buying
[4125.12s] handover fist in October 2022 when no
[4127.759s] one wanted it? This little company
[4129.759s] called Amazon. Okay. When you it was it
[4133.279s] was marked down 50%, you couldn&#39;t give
[4135.199s] it away. Another company called Alphabet
[4138.279s] Google. Okay. So, I&#39;m pro tech at the
[4141.04s] right price in the right way. Uh and we
[4144.0s] got out of those last summer. Uh and
[4147.56s] um so, you know, and they basically done
[4150.48s] nothing ever since with with the recent
[4152.799s] draw down. Now, here&#39;s the new theme.
[4154.88s] This is what you guys have been waiting
[4156.08s] for. We&#39;ve gone from conceptual to
[4159.159s] pragmatic. Here&#39;s something that you
[4162.56s] will never hear outside this
[4165.319s] room. Second half US housing revival.
[4170.239s] Okay, this is the farthest thing from
[4171.759s] truth. Uh they continue to underperform
[4174.08s] with sentiment at multi-year lows. We we
[4176.4s] see this as overdone with several
[4178.4s] catalysts ahead. Lower rates. You&#39;re
[4180.64s] like, how are we going to get lower
[4181.6s] rates? We just had a credit downgrade
[4184.48s] last night. Who saw that? Okay. Uh
[4187.44s] people were asking me what&#39;s going to
[4188.48s] happen Monday morning. I was like, I
[4189.679s] don&#39;t know. All I know is the businesses
[4191.279s] in my portfolio, their free cash flow is
[4193.52s] going to be the same. Their revenues is
[4195.04s] are going to be the same. Their earnings
[4196.4s] power is going to be the same. Uh so I
[4198.88s] don&#39;t I don&#39;t spend a lot of time on
[4200.48s] that. Uh and what we&#39;ve seen in the past
[4202.64s] the last two times kind of like you get
[4204.64s] a little dip and then it&#39;s
[4206.36s] fine. So we view this as a long-term
[4209.36s] opportunity and highlight three picks
[4211.28s] picks and shovel plays to express the
[4213.28s] theme. Why aren&#39;t we just buying home
[4215.28s] builders if we&#39;re so excited about this
[4217.199s] theme? Uh, we like to buy the arms
[4220.719s] dealers, not the waring factions. The
[4223.04s] waring factions beat themselves up. As
[4225.6s] this thesis plays out, you&#39;re going to
[4227.28s] see a massive volume of new starter
[4230.88s] homes produced, which is going to create
[4233.44s] excess supply, the exact opposite of
[4236.4s] what we have right now, which is a der
[4238.159s] of supply. And you&#39;re going to see
[4239.6s] incentives, you&#39;re going to see margin
[4241.04s] compression, you&#39;re going to see big
[4242.8s] volume. And we&#39;re going to talk about
[4244.08s] how do we get to that position. So at
[4246.56s] the current pace of construction, it
[4247.84s] would take seven and a half years to
[4249.679s] close the multi-million dollar home
[4251.28s] deficit, which is about four or five
[4252.8s] million homes. Um decade plus of
[4255.84s] underbuilding has pushed the median age
[4258.08s] of owner occupied homes to 41 years from
[4260.96s] 31 in 20 uh 2005. 48% of the new housing
[4265.44s] stock dates back to of the US housing
[4267.92s] stock dates back to the 1980s or
[4270.48s] earlier. So, we have an old housing
[4272.08s] stock. We have a limited housing stock
[4274.64s] and uh we need to build four to seven
[4277.6s] million homes very very quickly. So, how
[4279.92s] how&#39;s that going to
[4281.239s] happen? First off, mortgage rates are
[4283.76s] easing. Okay, so they peaked at seven
[4287.04s] and change. They&#39;re now down, you know,
[4289.28s] six and a half or so, but the uh 7.79,
[4292.56s] highest in 23 years. Today, they&#39;re at
[4295.4s] 6.76. And they&#39;ve been rangebound
[4297.44s] between six and a half and seven for the
[4299.04s] past six months. Now, um part of that is
[4302.64s] people are stuck in low mortgages.
[4304.08s] That&#39;s affecting supply. Uh when rates
[4307.28s] approach 6% in late 2024, we saw 18
[4310.88s] consecutive weeks of positive purchase
[4313.6s] applications. Okay, so now we&#39;ve come
[4315.44s] back up. So, how do we get mortgage
[4317.44s] rates down? Well, Secretary Bashan, our
[4320.159s] Treasury Secretary, made it clear. Okay,
[4323.199s] he his objective is to lower the 10-year
[4326.4s] yield. What are mortgage rates priced
[4328.88s] off of? It&#39;s not priced off the Fed
[4330.719s] funds rate. It&#39;s priced off the 10-year
[4332.8s] yield because it&#39;s a longer duration
[4334.8s] loan. And how he&#39;s going to do that is
[4337.36s] he&#39;s going to exempt governmentbacked
[4339.92s] securities from the SLR. And he believes
[4342.88s] that will lower the 10-year yield by 30
[4345.199s] to 70 basis points. And we expect this
[4347.199s] to happen in the second half of the
[4348.56s] year. So, if you take the 10-year yield
[4351.44s] down 30 to 70 basis points, which would
[4353.92s] basically be 375 to
[4357.8s] 350, you get a 30-year fixed mortgage. I
[4362.48s] know this is going to blow your mind,
[4364.56s] uh, below 6%.
[4367.679s] And if you get a 30-year fixed mortgage
[4370.32s] at five and change in the next 12
[4372.56s] months, the demand for housing is going
[4375.199s] to be something like we have never seen
[4376.719s] in our lifetimes because everyone has
[4379.52s] been priced out. Everyone&#39;s been
[4380.96s] waiting. And then you couple that with
[4383.6s] you&#39;re going to start to see an increase
[4385.12s] of supply. 1982 40% of the new homes
[4389.04s] were entry level under,400 square foot
[4391.6s] house. Uh by 2023 that dropped to 9%.
[4396.96s] And how are they going to get more
[4399.8s] supply? Those colored areas on the map
[4402.719s] are federal lands that there&#39;s currently
[4406.4s] no construction on. Trump is going to
[4408.239s] open up a portion of those lands to
[4411.52s] construct starter homes. So you get your
[4414.0s] 1500 foot house from KB Homes with your
[4417.4s] 5.9% mortgage and an endangered elk in
[4420.239s] your backyard free of charge. Okay. It&#39;s
[4423.04s] going to be awesome.
[4425.04s] Um, so he&#39;s also cut red tape. That&#39;s a
[4428.239s] top priority under this administration.
[4429.84s] He&#39;s terminated the AFFH rule. He&#39;s
[4432.96s] restored local control and removed local
[4437.04s] zoning tax. In 2022, 83% of uh delays
[4441.44s] were attributed to permitting issues.
[4444.08s] They are going to destroy the red tape
[4446.64s] and make it easier and easier for
[4448.08s] companies to build, to buy land, and to
[4449.679s] build quickly. The administration is
[4451.92s] focused on another key solution. Opening
[4453.6s] portions of the 640 million acres of
[4456.159s] federal land for large-scale housing
[4457.76s] development. Roughly 47 million acres
[4460.159s] where 7.3% of federal land fall within
[4462.719s] metropolitan areas. Everyone thinks it&#39;s
[4464.88s] only in the middle of nowhere. Uh where
[4467.52s] more housing is needing needed. And the
[4470.08s] AEI estimates that if we just unlock,
[4472.48s] forget 640 million acres, if we just
[4474.719s] unlock 512,000 acres in the metro areas
[4477.679s] and outside areas, that could support
[4479.6s] the construction of 3 million new
[4482.6s] homes. Okay. Now, if you&#39;re going to
[4485.76s] build three million new homes, uh
[4488.159s] demographics, you know about the
[4489.44s] millennials, they all need houses.
[4490.719s] They&#39;re all starting families. We won&#39;t
[4492.08s] go into that. Here&#39;s pick number
[4494.28s] one, QXO.
[4498.0s] This is a Brad Jacobs company. Does
[4500.88s] anyone know who Brad Jacobs is? Okay. He
[4504.08s] one guy, the guy who listens to my
[4505.44s] podcast, uh too, uh he wrote a book, How
[4508.719s] to make a few billion dollars. He&#39;s made
[4510.8s] about12 billion and he&#39;s made a lot more
[4512.56s] for shareholders. He&#39;s starting this
[4514.48s] QXO. He&#39;s going to roll up building
[4516.32s] supply companies because he sees this
[4518.32s] opportunity. Uh we built a position at
[4520.64s] $13 and change. It&#39;s like 16 now. Over
[4523.76s] the next five to seven years, we believe
[4525.36s] this stock goes well above 50, probably
[4527.36s] 80 to $100. Uh he did XPO logistics and
[4532.08s] he did United Rentals. Did everyone know
[4534.64s] United Rentals and Equipment Leasing?
[4536.64s] Both of those were rollups. If you put a
[4539.92s] million bucks in United Rentals, you
[4541.679s] made over 50 million bucks over 20
[4543.6s] years. If you put a million in XPO over
[4546.48s] 10 years, you made about 60 million.
[4549.28s] Okay, that&#39;s enough to get that coffee
[4551.04s] going, that caffeine going. Ladies and
[4552.719s] gentlemen, he&#39;s going to do it again.
[4554.239s] And by the way, he put 150 million when
[4556.88s] he did of his own money in XPO. He&#39;s put
[4560.239s] a billion dollars of his own money in
[4563.8s] QXO. So, he&#39;s putting his money where
[4565.76s] his mouth is. He sees this trend. He
[4568.679s] aims to do 10% of any given industry.
[4573.12s] It&#39;s an $800 billion industry. 80
[4575.44s] billion topline, 10% IBIDA margins.
[4578.159s] That&#39;s eight billion dollars. You put a
[4579.679s] 12 10 12 times multiple, you have, you
[4582.8s] know, conservatively five six bagger,
[4584.56s] but we think it could be closer to, you
[4586.64s] know, $100 stock. I think uh that&#39;s
[4589.28s] that&#39;s how we&#39;re underwriting it. Right
[4591.84s] now, Beacon is their platform company.
[4593.76s] It&#39;s a roofing company they just bought.
[4595.28s] So, they&#39;re in business. Now, they&#39;ll
[4596.56s] roll up all different types of um arms
[4599.92s] dealers to the home builders, all types
[4601.679s] of building supply companies over the
[4603.6s] next five years. This is one you buy,
[4605.12s] you tuck away. Not for five minutes, not
[4607.199s] for five months, five years. Huge
[4609.84s] multiple on your money. We like it.
[4611.84s] Second one is Stanley Black &amp; Decker. If
[4613.44s] you&#39;re going to build houses, what do
[4614.48s] you need? Tools. They own DeWalt. They
[4617.12s] own Craftsman. They own
[4618.92s] Stanley. This one got crushed by COVID
[4621.76s] over inventoried, inflation, etc. What I
[4624.719s] can tell you is they&#39;ve taken out the
[4626.64s] last two years almost $2 billion of
[4628.8s] business uh of cost.$2 two billion
[4631.92s] dollars of costs, which equates to about
[4638.52s] uh it&#39;s about $13 per share on $154
[4643.28s] million shares just on the cost savings
[4645.92s] as they normalize margins. Uh we think
[4649.04s] that&#39;s worth $200. It&#39;s trading at $71
[4652.0s] right
[4653.0s] now. It&#39;s not going to do it in three
[4655.12s] months. It&#39;s going to do it in three
[4656.64s] years as the cycle turns. The operating
[4659.28s] leverage in this business is insane.
[4662.0s] When construction volumes go up and and
[4664.4s] construction turns the corner, this is
[4666.64s] the business to play because this
[4668.56s] business has been around since
[4670.92s] 1843. It&#39;s been through a couple cycles,
[4673.36s] ladies and
[4674.44s] gentlemen. 1843. You think it&#39;s going to
[4677.04s] make it through, you know, made it
[4678.4s] through the Great Depression, made it
[4680.159s] through the Great Financial Crisis. You
[4682.239s] think it&#39;s going to make it through
[4683.199s] Trump? of course he&#39;s going to make it
[4684.719s] through Trump because he&#39;s going to make
[4686.0s] everyone build houses and bring the
[4687.92s] houses down and and uh bring the cost
[4689.84s] down, etc. So, we love this play. Uh we
[4693.28s] think management has done a good job
[4695.04s] executing in really hard conditions. We
[4697.76s] love that they they&#39;ve delevered the
[4699.28s] balance sheet, taken the costs out. So,
[4701.44s] and we&#39;re seeing now the business
[4703.6s] inflect revenues start to
[4706.44s] reacelerate. Margins starting to
[4708.239s] reacelerate. The last time they got
[4710.48s] margins to this level, the stock traded
[4712.32s] at $150 a
[4714.679s] share.
[4716.679s] Okay. And the final
[4719.4s] one is
[4721.8s] GenerRack, the Kleenex of home standby
[4725.08s] generators.
[4727.0s] Okay. No, we&#39;re not going to cure cancer
[4729.52s] today. We&#39;re not going to guess who&#39;s
[4731.199s] going to win the AI race, but we&#39;re
[4732.96s] going to keep your power on so you can
[4734.8s] run your AI queries through uh Alibaba&#39;s
[4738.64s] Quinn 2.4 large language model. Uh you
[4741.36s] can use open AI, too. But uh we&#39;re going
[4743.679s] to talk about uh a special international
[4746.159s] play in the breakout room. Uh what is
[4748.64s] that in 15 minutes, Mike? Yeah, you&#39;re
[4752.159s] okay. So, you&#39;re gonna like that. The
[4753.679s] theme of that room is called How the
[4755.76s] Uninvestable Became Investable. We&#39;re
[4758.08s] going to talk about some quote unquote
[4759.84s] currently uninvestable stocks and the
[4762.64s] actions we took in previous uninvestable
[4765.12s] stocks and what happened. Okay. Uh so
[4768.08s] Generrack is a huge play on the home
[4770.4s] building. All I can tell you about this
[4772.64s] one and this is really what I do. I like
[4775.6s] to look at divergences between price and
[4779.52s] cash flow because the only reason you
[4782.0s] give $1 of your money into any business
[4785.679s] is you expect to get more than $1 back.
[4788.48s] So if they&#39;re not generating any cash,
[4791.199s] then your only hope is that another
[4794.4s] sucker comes behind you and pays more.
[4797.199s] And that&#39;s nothing more than a hope. And
[4800.8s] where you can really get hurt is if that
[4803.6s] hope comes true because as I said at the
[4806.239s] beginning of the presentation is the
[4808.239s] gamblers tend to give the money back to
[4809.679s] the casino. So when you get the high
[4812.239s] flyers right and you double your money
[4814.08s] quickly and you don&#39;t know how it
[4815.199s] happened oftentimes you wind up saying
[4817.36s] I&#39;m so smart and going into the next
[4819.12s] thing that you don&#39;t understand and uh
[4821.36s] and getting hurt. So with this you can
[4823.679s] see what&#39;s happened. You can see why the
[4825.199s] price dropped 80%. You see those red
[4827.199s] bars on the top? That&#39;s negative free
[4829.44s] cash flow. People were worried about
[4831.199s] solveny risk. Look what&#39;s happened since
[4833.6s] they&#39;ve cut cost, increased margin, and
[4835.36s] the cycles come back. Free cash flow&#39;s
[4838.159s] gone up. And what hasn&#39;t gone up
[4840.84s] yet that&#39;s starting to inflect is price.
[4845.84s] And if you can find businesses where
[4847.679s] there&#39;s a divergence between either a
[4850.159s] price has gone up too high and cash flow
[4852.239s] is negative, that could be a short or
[4856.48s] price hasn&#39;t gone back up but cash flow
[4858.96s] has recovered. When they turn, it turns
[4861.76s] all at once and you make many multiples
[4864.4s] very very quickly. Uh this is going to
[4866.48s] be a triple over the next few years.
[4867.92s] This is another leverage play on the
[4870.159s] housing recovery inherent demand. So,
[4872.96s] uh, three super boring plays with super
[4876.239s] exciting outcomes if you have the
[4879.04s] patience and you sit tight and watch
[4881.12s] this play out over the next few years.
[4882.8s] So, with that said, I think we&#39;ve got it
[4886.32s] all. That&#39;s how you can reach me and
[4888.56s] we&#39;ll take one question or two. Yeah.
[4893.6s] Building.
[4895.679s] Yeah, I love it.
[4897.96s] Owen&#39;s in the house. Yeah, exactly. I
[4901.52s] think it would be great. Uh I haven&#39;t
[4902.96s] looked at the underlying fundamentals
[4904.56s] and and price and all that stuff, but I
[4906.239s] think anything in that sector, I like
[4908.08s] the way you&#39;re thinking.
[4909.4s] Absolutely. Yeah. And by the way, and
[4912.56s] and the other thing I would think about
[4913.679s] these type of stocks, when you have a
[4915.04s] stock like Gener that&#39;s down 75%. Okay.
[4918.08s] Um, if it goes $5 against you tomorrow,
[4921.28s] just log in, look at the free cash flow
[4924.639s] and say, &quot;Ah, in the short term, the
[4927.199s] market is a voting machine based on
[4929.04s] emotion. That&#39;s where you get $5 moves.&quot;
[4931.28s] And you say, &quot;Am I wrong? What does
[4932.639s] everyone else know?&quot; Nothing. It could
[4934.4s] be a hedge fund blowing up. It could be
[4936.48s] a short attack. It could be nothing.
[4938.639s] Just look at the underlying business.
[4940.159s] Like if you were going to buy a jersey
[4941.92s] Mike&#39;s down the street and the guy said,
[4944.48s] &quot;How much do you want for your
[4945.6s] business?&quot; you say, &quot;Well, why don&#39;t you
[4947.6s] show me your books first, and if you&#39;re
[4949.679s] profitable, I&#39;ll make you an offer.&quot; You
[4952.56s] know, people do that in normal business.
[4954.56s] They don&#39;t do it in the stock market.
[4956.159s] And if you just apply that framework,
[4959.04s] uh, I think you&#39;re going to see massive
[4960.8s] success in your investing future. So,
[4963.44s] uh, with that said, thank you so much
[4964.639s] for having me.
[4966.11s] [Applause]
[4971.36s] And we&#39;re back. And then finally the
[4973.28s] breakout room which it was the last
[4976.4s] segment on the last day following the
[4979.199s] keynote. A lot of people had flights. We
[4981.36s] filled the room. I mean it was just
[4983.199s] unbelievable all the podcast listeners
[4985.36s] and all the people that saw the keynote
[4986.719s] that decided to stick around. Uh I did
[4989.44s] not expect that. Very grateful. And we
[4991.76s] talk about how the uninvestable became
[4993.96s] investable. But not just one name. uh
[4997.44s] multiple examples throughout time that
[5000.08s] we&#39;ve done and what we were thinking,
[5002.08s] how we were thinking, and how you can
[5003.36s] use that filter in your own investing to
[5006.639s] really get the returns you&#39;re looking
[5008.48s] for for the money show. I want to thank
[5011.04s] Kim Gitler, Debbie Osborne, Mike Larson,
[5014.56s] Aaron Wise, and uh Kim started the whole
[5018.88s] thing. I had the pleasure to sit next to
[5020.4s] her at the dinner for the full two
[5021.76s] hours. What an incredible story. What an
[5023.6s] incredible success. Uh, so let&#39;s listen
[5026.4s] in here. Became
[5030.6s] investable.
[5032.76s] So all right, we&#39;re stuck here, man.
[5039.48s] Oh, let me try using this. How&#39;s that
[5042.88s] work? Okay, good. Uh, we went through
[5044.8s] this. Everyone saw the main keynote
[5046.8s] presentation, so we don&#39;t have to go
[5048.239s] through this again.
[5050.44s] Uh, the podcast video cast. I would
[5053.6s] strongly suggest that if you didn&#39;t
[5055.04s] write it down, hedge fun tips with Tom
[5057.4s] Hayes. You can find it anywhere you get
[5060.48s] your podcast or on YouTube is best. And
[5064.08s] the reason it&#39;s great on YouTube is
[5065.92s] because I go through 10 20 uh what do we
[5069.76s] do like 50 pages of data charts,
[5073.679s] fundamental stuff, macroeconomic stuff
[5075.92s] every single week. So, if you can see
[5078.159s] the charts when I&#39;m talking about
[5079.88s] demographics, if you can see the charts
[5081.76s] when I&#39;m talking about earnings, it&#39;s
[5083.36s] it&#39;s helpful. If you listen, it&#39;s great,
[5085.12s] too. I know people like to exercise and
[5087.28s] walk around while they do podcast, but
[5089.04s] you&#39;ll get significantly more value
[5092.4s] doing it that
[5094.12s] way.
[5096.28s] Welcome.
[5097.96s] Um, we&#39;ll talk about this. I can&#39;t
[5100.719s] overemphasize these four points and I
[5102.719s] know I did it in the previous
[5104.6s] presentation but owing Corning the only
[5107.36s] thing I have to look at is the balance
[5109.6s] sheet. So how much cash do they have?
[5111.92s] How much debt do they have? What&#39;s their
[5114.159s] free cash flow to service that interest
[5116.8s] payment? And when do the different debt
[5119.92s] maturities come
[5121.48s] due? And if you can get comfortable like
[5124.639s] by with that you see the free cash flow
[5126.96s] trends are pretty stable then yeah it&#39;s
[5128.88s] a home run. You might even buy a few
[5130.239s] more shares at that level as well. Yeah,
[5133.239s] exactly. Um, you know what? Go to hedge
[5136.92s] funips.com, click on the contact button,
[5141.28s] and you will see that you can write in
[5143.199s] your name and you&#39;ll see click AMA for
[5145.84s] ask me anything question. At the end of
[5148.48s] every single podcast, I take questions
[5150.88s] from the audience. So, I&#39;ll get like 10
[5153.76s] to 12 different companies per week and
[5156.08s] I&#39;ll pull up the chart. I pull up the
[5158.08s] balance sheet. I pull up the income
[5159.52s] statement. I pull up the cash flow
[5160.8s] statement. And we go through it step by
[5162.32s] step. And I say, &quot;That&#39;s a great
[5164.48s] question. Here&#39;s why I would definitely
[5166.88s] look deeper at this because this is a
[5168.4s] great idea. Here&#39;s why I would pass.&quot;
[5171.36s] And I do like in the last half hour, I
[5173.76s] do like 10 12 of those very, very
[5176.0s] quickly. Um, well, actually, not very
[5178.32s] quickly. Sometimes it runs for like a
[5179.84s] long time. Uh, so that would be a great
[5182.28s] place. Send that in. So you will be the
[5184.88s] number one ask me anything question and
[5186.639s] and we&#39;re doing it early this week
[5188.159s] because I&#39;m going to be in Dubai
[5189.36s] visiting a client. So we&#39;ll have our
[5191.6s] podcast on Tuesday.
[5195.04s] Okay. Fantastic.
[5198.36s] Um, management
[5200.52s] is imperative.
[5203.44s] Uh we have a company called which we&#39;re
[5206.8s] not going to talk about today which now
[5208.239s] we are because you guys stayed the extra
[5210.639s] hour called VF Corp. Anyone familiar
[5214.239s] with VF Corp? They&#39;ve been around since
[5217.48s] 189
[5219.4s] something 93 95 125 years. What they
[5224.239s] have a DNA for doing is buying and
[5228.0s] selling brands. Okay. So right now the
[5230.88s] brands in their stable are
[5233.4s] Northbased,
[5235.159s] Timberland, Vans, okay, a company called
[5237.84s] Vans. And Vans has gotten hit extremely
[5240.32s] hard because they oversupplied during
[5243.679s] COVID. It was super popular. Everyone
[5246.08s] bought three pairs of Vans, very similar
[5248.4s] to Nike with the Air Force Ones. Uh, and
[5251.52s] then and the Air Jordans. And then it
[5254.56s] went through three years of
[5256.44s] decline. They brought in a new CEO. His
[5259.04s] name is Bracken
[5260.92s] Daryl. And the thing you need to know
[5262.96s] about Bracken Daryl, and I&#39;m trying to
[5264.639s] emphasize this point about
[5267.4s] management. Bracken Daryl has a
[5269.6s] background at Proctor and Gamble, at Old
[5271.76s] Spice. He&#39;s a brand manager. He&#39;s
[5273.44s] exceptional at it. He came into a little
[5275.84s] company
[5276.84s] called Logitech. Okay.
[5280.76s] And this
[5282.92s] is the cancer curing products that they
[5285.84s] made at Logitech.
[5287.92s] Okay. Complete commodity product.
[5290.639s] Nothing revolutionary about a mouse or a
[5294.44s] webcam. He came in when the stock was
[5296.88s] down 82% just like he came in at BF Corp
[5300.48s] with the stock down
[5302.04s] 82%. Uh in the next 10
[5306.04s] years it was a 28 bagger. A million
[5310.0s] dollars became $28 million selling this
[5314.0s] that you could get anywhere. Why is that
[5317.52s] a Logitech? Okay. Because he understood
[5320.719s] branding. He understood operations. He
[5322.56s] understood supply chain management. He&#39;s
[5324.719s] a winner. You want to bet on the jockey.
[5326.8s] So you may say, &quot;Oh, Vans will never
[5328.56s] come back.&quot; Bracken will bring it back.
[5330.56s] He&#39;s he&#39;s worked through the channels.
[5332.56s] Now he&#39;s going to ramp it up. He&#39;s going
[5334.159s] to start bringing in the creators and
[5336.56s] the the influencers and the the whole
[5340.0s] marketing plan. You&#39;re going to see
[5341.199s] massive action. Northace is a recovery
[5343.6s] on China. It&#39;s doing well. Timberlin the
[5346.0s] same thing. So this is the type of bet.
[5348.8s] So when you&#39;re buying a stock down and
[5350.48s] what did he do? He sold off Supreme for
[5353.76s] over a billion dollars to pay down debt
[5356.08s] to delever the balance sheet. Why? To
[5358.96s] get multi-year runway to run the
[5362.239s] turnaround plan and not get stopped out
[5364.719s] in the meantime. So that&#39;s the type of
[5366.719s] things that we like to look at. So
[5368.239s] near-term catalyst, etc.
[5376.44s] Um, the key with
[5379.48s] these is the temperament. So, I&#39;m known
[5383.679s] as Turnaround Tom because I like to buy
[5386.639s] good businesses when they&#39;re marked
[5387.92s] down. Uh, but you have to have a certain
[5390.719s] level of ice in your veins. So, like I I
[5394.639s] keep going with the the nickname that
[5396.639s] people gave me, but they&#39;re starting to
[5397.92s] give me the Iceman name, okay? because
[5399.76s] they&#39;ve seen me with, you know, stocks
[5402.56s] down and I&#39;m like, &quot;Yeah, what&#39;s the
[5403.84s] problem?&quot; People like, &quot;Are you sure we
[5405.36s] should own this?&quot; And then like four
[5406.8s] months later, you know, we were buying
[5408.4s] Vornnado
[5409.92s] uh during the mini banking crisis. What
[5412.48s] was that? March of 2023 and they were
[5415.44s] throwing banks baby out when um Silicon
[5418.159s] National Bank collapsed and they were
[5420.4s] throwing out everything with the
[5421.679s] bathwater. The the last thing you could
[5424.08s] talk to people about buying is an office
[5426.719s] read. Okay? I mean, but what did we do?
[5430.48s] We saw the
[5432.04s] dislocation and we picked the highest
[5436.08s] quality business in the most dislocated
[5439.52s] market. So, if office was going to be
[5442.44s] destroyed, which there was a compelling
[5444.56s] case for that to be to happen, which by
[5447.679s] the way it hasn&#39;t, which was the camp we
[5449.92s] were in, but we had to assume that it
[5451.6s] was going to happen, that we weren&#39;t
[5453.12s] smarter than 99% of the people that said
[5455.12s] office was over. Who would be left
[5457.6s] standing? There would be some offices
[5459.8s] left and what would be left would be the
[5462.639s] highest quality in the basket and that&#39;s
[5465.12s] what Hornado owned in New York, all the
[5468.159s] best locations, etc. And then I could
[5470.8s] bet on the jockey, Steve Roth,
[5473.96s] multi-billionaire. Uh, everyone I spoke
[5476.8s] to that knew him said the same thing.
[5480.159s] The guy&#39;s like
[5481.56s] 80. He will not die until his stock is
[5484.56s] back at all-time highs. I can assure you
[5486.159s] that. And that&#39;s what I got from and I
[5488.8s] met this guy uh
[5491.48s] in
[5493.239s] 2010 at an idea launch and this guy was
[5497.199s] no nonsense. You you have to know who
[5499.76s] you&#39;re betting on is what I&#39;m saying.
[5501.199s] You need a good quality business, a
[5503.28s] stable balance sheet to get through the
[5504.8s] downturn and a good jockey to turn it
[5507.0s] around.
[5508.6s] Okay? And the temperament to wait it
[5510.88s] out. And this temperament comes also.
[5513.84s] How many of you trade on or invest on
[5516.159s] margin or
[5517.96s] leverage? Yeah. So that&#39;s where you get
[5520.48s] stopped out because if you if you if if
[5523.84s] a stock is temporarily down 20% against
[5526.08s] you, you might be down 40%. And you
[5529.6s] might not be you might have relinquished
[5532.32s] the decision to someone else called a
[5536.159s] margin clerk as to whether or not you
[5538.48s] could continue to have ICE in your veins
[5540.96s] and stick it through until Bracken Works
[5543.76s] turns your million bucks into 28 million
[5546.159s] bucks
[5547.48s] with nothing break through here at all.
[5550.88s] or if the margin clerk takes your money
[5554.32s] and sells your shares down 40% to a guy
[5556.639s] like me who&#39;s sitting in cash waiting
[5558.719s] for this for the
[5560.36s] shares. Okay? So, you want to be on my
[5562.96s] side of the table, not that side. And
[5564.88s] the way you guarantee that is very low
[5568.0s] to zero margin. If you buy these stocks,
[5572.0s] right, you will make more than enough
[5573.52s] money. You don&#39;t have to
[5576.76s] get people who get hurt are people who
[5580.0s] try to get rich too fast. Okay? When you
[5583.12s] slow it down and the older you get, I
[5584.8s] know I look young, the longer my time
[5587.199s] horizon is, and the wealthier I&#39;ve
[5588.88s] become. When I was young, I wanted to be
[5591.679s] on margin. I wanted to get rich and make
[5593.679s] a million bucks in a week. If I just buy
[5596.0s] these uh zero day options and the market
[5598.159s] goes up 5%, I can make up, you know, 10
[5601.12s] million, whatever. and you wind up wiped
[5603.6s] out. And most people don&#39;t make it
[5605.44s] through that and they&#39;re they&#39;re out.
[5608.48s] And if they just understood the right
[5610.0s] principles at the beginning, buy great
[5611.679s] businesses when they&#39;re at good prices
[5613.679s] and wait and don&#39;t be on margin. Don&#39;t
[5616.159s] give your decision to wait to the margin
[5618.4s] clerk who&#39;s going to make it the
[5619.52s] decision for
[5620.6s] you. Small portion that&#39;s okay. Even
[5622.96s] Charlie liked a little bit of leverage.
[5624.639s] So, uh, Charlie Munger that is. So,
[5628.0s] that&#39;s that. That&#39;s temperament.
[5631.52s] What does uninvestable mean? The term
[5634.8s] uninvestable is music to our
[5637.719s] ears. It tells us that an asset or
[5640.32s] market has become perceived as so
[5642.44s] uncertain, so risky, and fearful that
[5645.04s] it&#39;s easier to slap the label
[5646.56s] uninvestable on it, regardless of the
[5649.12s] fundamentals or valuation. That&#39;s
[5651.44s] critical. That&#39;s why Jeff put it in a
[5653.199s] different color font. Okay. regardless
[5656.48s] of the fundamentals or valuation just to
[5659.12s] avoid the scrutiny, headlines and career
[5661.44s] risk of going against the
[5663.719s] crowd. So most people are structured,
[5668.32s] most active managers are what we call
[5671.36s] closet indexers.
[5673.84s] Their whole job is to collect assets and
[5676.96s] stay in business. Because if they
[5678.32s] collect assets and stay in business,
[5680.32s] they have an annuity that goes up over
[5682.4s] time in perpetuity because what happens?
[5684.8s] the market goes up over time in
[5686.88s] perpetuity. So if they can if they don&#39;t
[5689.36s] zigg too far from consensus and it they
[5692.32s] have a downyear, they get to keep their
[5694.56s] job because they didn&#39;t do worse by
[5697.36s] taking an unconventional bet. You as
[5700.32s] individual investors don&#39;t have those
[5702.239s] constraints on you. You can buy and
[5704.639s] underwrite an individual business like
[5706.4s] we talked about in the main room and you
[5708.32s] don&#39;t have to worry about the short-term
[5709.679s] volatility, the short-term marktomarket,
[5712.4s] uh the job risk that some of the
[5714.48s] managers uh closet indexers have and why
[5717.52s] they stick. So what closet indexing
[5719.92s] means is that they hug very closely to
[5723.92s] the index that they&#39;re measured against.
[5725.84s] So most managers are measured against
[5727.679s] the S&amp;P. You&#39;ll notice that the top five
[5730.239s] weights of the X and S&amp;P are X, Y, and
[5733.44s] Z, MAG 7 mostly. You&#39;ll notice that most
[5736.4s] active managers have the same stocks.
[5739.04s] Okay? So, you&#39;re just paying more fees
[5740.48s] for effectively the same outcome.
[5743.8s] Um, so
[5746.36s] we we run things very differently, very
[5750.159s] similar to how Warren Buffett managed
[5752.96s] money for outside clients before he
[5756.08s] rolled it into the public company and
[5757.92s] had different types of constraints. So
[5759.76s] he was doing a lot more turnarounds, a
[5762.159s] lot more quick doubles and triples in
[5764.239s] his private partnerships than he was
[5766.56s] able to do in the big because once he
[5768.159s] got the insurance float, he had too much
[5770.96s] money to put to work that he couldn&#39;t be
[5772.88s] quite as nimble two, three years. He was
[5774.88s] more interested in 10 years or forever
[5777.44s] if he could do it because that insurance
[5779.52s] float just kept coming in and coming in
[5781.12s] and coming in. Okay. Um different asset
[5784.56s] classes and sectors have been deemed
[5786.199s] uninvestable many times throughout
[5788.159s] market history. financials after the
[5789.76s] great financial crisis. What was the
[5791.679s] best trade you could have possibly made
[5793.44s] after the March 2009 lows? You know,
[5796.32s] financials, City Bank, Bank of America,
[5798.48s] JP Morgan, etc. Uh they were completely
[5801.52s] quote uninvestable. People kept waiting
[5803.679s] for the retest of the lows,
[5806.199s] etc. Uh tech stocks following the dot
[5810.08s] crash and energy during the pandemic.
[5813.36s] Does anyone remember when energy prices
[5815.44s] went negative? In theory, they would pay
[5819.44s] you to take oil from them. Okay? You
[5823.199s] can&#39;t make this stuff up. Uh so we&#39;ll
[5825.6s] tell you what we did during that. Uh
[5828.32s] uninvestable is often profitable. Taking
[5830.4s] the opposite side of most crowded trades
[5832.6s] historically has generated excess
[5835.04s] returns averaging 7 to 19% annually over
[5839.04s] periods ranging from 8 to 22 years.
[5842.08s] Since 1994, Morning Stars unloved
[5845.119s] sectors, those with the most outflows in
[5847.92s] the prior years. Remember in the
[5849.6s] previous presentation I talked about the
[5851.92s] last shall be first. That was our theme
[5853.84s] going into this year. The LA the worst
[5856.159s] performing last year international
[5859.6s] uh non-magnificent seven uh value going
[5864.0s] into this year. Those were our themes
[5865.199s] and those have been the big big
[5866.32s] outperformers this year. Okay. So with
[5869.679s] this uh Morning Stars quote unquote
[5872.48s] unloved sectors returned 10.96 annually
[5875.76s] nearly doubling the
[5877.639s] 5.57% from the quote loved sectors i.e.
[5881.199s] the ones that had the most inflows in
[5883.76s] the year before. Okay. It&#39;s it&#39;s just
[5886.56s] human
[5887.48s] nature to want to chase what&#39;s already
[5890.32s] worked because you feel like it&#39;s safe.
[5892.239s] It&#39;s already working. Uh it&#39;s not risky.
[5895.44s] But actually those are the riskiest
[5897.92s] things unfortunately and that&#39;s why you
[5900.08s] see this divergence of
[5902.76s] underperformance. So we look back here
[5905.199s] to
[5907.239s] uh
[5910.52s] 200 we got here uh basically what is
[5915.4s] this? It&#39;s a little blurry but this
[5917.679s] talks about oil relative uh energy
[5919.84s] stocks versus the rest of the market.
[5922.159s] Talks about tech stocks versus cash.
[5924.719s] talks about um energy stocks pre great
[5927.6s] financial crisis when they were on that
[5929.04s] run and you can see these extremes
[5930.88s] always work themselves out. So everyone
[5933.36s] gets excited. So what what do you think
[5935.36s] would
[5937.96s] be most loved right
[5940.679s] now? I&#39;m asking you. I don&#39;t know the
[5942.88s] answer to this question. What do you
[5943.76s] guys think everyone&#39;s super excited
[5945.119s] about? Go ahead. Semiconductors. Okay.
[5948.56s] Yeah. Certainly last year and Nvidia
[5950.48s] peaked at uh June 20th. I remember
[5954.88s] because we wrote an article on June
[5956.56s] 20th. You can check hedge
[5958.28s] funips.com. And the thumbnail of the
[5961.639s] article was a picture of Jensen Wong
[5965.679s] signing a fan&#39;s
[5969.239s] brazier and I knew that was the
[5971.44s] short-term
[5972.76s] top. Uh I&#39;ve been to this movie a few
[5975.44s] times and the stock has actually not
[5977.52s] made new highs since that point. It may
[5980.32s] go on to make it but that&#39;s almost a
[5982.32s] year of dead money and it had quite a
[5984.48s] big draw down maybe 40% from that point
[5987.6s] at one at one point 35 40%.
[5992.199s] Okay. So, semiconductors, anything else
[5994.719s] people are super excited
[5996.6s] about? AI. Yeah, a lot of hype in AI.
[5999.84s] And I think all that stuff is going to
[6001.679s] come true. The question is on a company
[6004.48s] by company
[6005.8s] basis, are you already paying for the
[6008.56s] best case scenario if everything they
[6011.119s] say comes true is already going to be
[6012.4s] true? If you&#39;re paying a hundred times
[6013.92s] sales for a stock, you know, that&#39;s
[6017.04s] pretty amazing. I if if you went to buy
[6019.52s] the local car
[6020.76s] wash and the seller is like, &quot;Uh, yeah,
[6023.92s] I&#39;ll sell the business to you.&quot; And
[6025.44s] you&#39;re like, &quot;Okay, what did you do last
[6026.8s] year?&quot; And he&#39;s like, &quot;Well, we did, you
[6028.88s] know, we did about a million dollars,
[6030.48s] about 80,000 a month.&quot; And he&#39;s like,
[6031.92s] &quot;All right, that&#39;s pretty good.&quot; You&#39;re
[6034.639s] thinking, &quot;All right, what did you
[6035.92s] earn?&quot; Well, we earned about $300,000 on
[6038.88s] that million dollars of sales. That&#39;s
[6041.119s] pretty good business. You know, you
[6042.159s] might offer him one and a half million,
[6044.56s] two million bucks. But he comes back and
[6046.96s] he says,
[6048.04s] &quot;Uh, yeah, we&#39;re going to grow like
[6050.679s] crazy. We&#39;re going to buy up every
[6052.719s] single thing. Uh, we want a hundred
[6056.84s] million for that
[6059.159s] $300,000 of earnings power.&quot; And you may
[6061.84s] say, &quot;Yeah, this guy&#39;s pretty
[6062.96s] charismatic. He could probably buy 10
[6064.639s] more. Maybe he&#39;ll buy 20 more.&quot; Uh, but
[6068.0s] if you pay a hundred million, I
[6071.199s] guarantee you you&#39;re already paying for
[6073.6s] the best case scenario. So, if he only
[6076.88s] buys two more car washes, you&#39;re going
[6079.679s] to lose an awful lot of money if you pay
[6081.84s] him a hundred million. And you probably
[6084.8s] lose half your money even if he does buy
[6087.52s] every other car wash that he&#39;s talking
[6089.36s] about. And that&#39;s what you have to be
[6090.88s] careful of. You know, when God was Does
[6093.199s] anyone know what FOMO is? fear of
[6095.679s] missing out. So, I think it&#39;s genetic
[6098.8s] and and I think when God was handing out
[6100.96s] FOMO genes, he passed up Tom Hayes,
[6104.719s] okay? Because, you know, people I mean
[6107.04s] people I got rich on Bitcoin, I&#39;m so
[6109.44s] happy for you. That&#39;s great. It&#39;s
[6110.96s] outside of my lane. It&#39;s not what I do,
[6112.88s] okay? Uh I got rich on Nvidia.
[6116.76s] Congratulations. I&#39;m so happy for you.
[6119.28s] It&#39;s outside of my lane. I just like
[6121.199s] these double, triple, quadruples. great
[6124.32s] businesses. I can sleep at night. Boeing
[6126.96s] at
[6127.8s] $130. Disney at $85. I don&#39;t need to
[6130.88s] think about these things. I don&#39;t need
[6132.159s] to stay up at night staring at the
[6133.84s] ceiling. Is Disney gonna stay in
[6136.08s] business? Okay. In the way it works in
[6138.56s] America is if you don&#39;t bring your
[6141.119s] children to Disneyland at least or world
[6144.8s] at least two or three times, child
[6147.28s] services comes to your house. They take
[6149.84s] your children and they take them away
[6151.92s] and they give them to new parents and
[6153.36s] they lock you up for being an abusive
[6155.28s] parent because you haven&#39;t taken your
[6156.8s] children to Disneyland. And that&#39;s never
[6159.199s] going to change. Okay. Uh the parks, the
[6162.8s] the cruises, they&#39;ve got 180 million sub
[6166.0s] uh streamers, which is half of what
[6168.159s] Netflix has. Netflix has like three
[6170.239s] times the valuation. Oh, and by the way,
[6172.239s] we got the parks, we got the cruises,
[6173.84s] we&#39;ve got the ESPN growing like
[6176.239s] wildfire.
[6178.08s] So things like
[6179.239s] that. Moving
[6181.159s] along. Okay, case study
[6184.36s] one. And you can go
[6187.32s] on hedge funips.com and see every video
[6190.719s] cast we&#39;ve ever done, every article
[6193.199s] we&#39;ve ever written and see what we were
[6194.88s] saying when when we did. Um, and it&#39;s
[6197.92s] and you&#39;re like, well, what does that
[6199.52s] help me to see? You got you got things
[6202.239s] right in the past. How&#39;s it going to
[6203.36s] help me in the future? Well, it might
[6205.119s] say to you like if he&#39;s consistently
[6208.32s] done pretty well, it might make sense
[6210.4s] for me to listen to the podcast and, you
[6213.36s] know, get some value for free moving
[6215.44s] forward and perspectively. And am I
[6216.8s] going to be right about everything? No.
[6218.239s] Am I going to be more right than wrong?
[6219.92s] Yeah, you bet. Okay. Because the
[6221.679s] framework we use is it&#39;s pretty hard to
[6224.639s] screw up. Okay. Pretty hard to screw up
[6227.6s] is really what it comes down to.
[6230.28s] So um energy was left for dead in 2020.
[6234.48s] It had been the worst performing sector
[6236.8s] of
[6238.92s] 2019. Lowest S&amp;P waiting on record at
[6243.0s] 3.5%. Highest short interest in nearly
[6245.679s] 20 years and it was trading at less than
[6248.239s] half the market multiple. If you want to
[6250.4s] talk about uninvestable and career risk,
[6253.04s] if you were a pension manager, if you
[6255.199s] were a money manager running money for
[6256.8s] pensions and you owned an energy stock
[6258.719s] in 2020, you were probably getting a
[6261.119s] pink
[6262.84s] slip because it was all about
[6264.88s] renewables. It was all all about we&#39;re
[6266.88s] going to, you know, uh, put up all these
[6269.52s] wind turbines and solar panels and all
[6272.8s] this fantasy land stuff, which is great.
[6274.719s] We need all of it and we need more than
[6276.4s] ever, natural gas, uh, etc. But it had
[6279.6s] gotten so extreme and the boat had
[6281.44s] shifted so far and we said, you know,
[6285.04s] this is a problem. Uh, but how do we
[6289.92s] benefit from this without taking
[6291.44s] abnormal risk? And what I thought about
[6294.159s] was one, I thought it was ridiculous
[6296.56s] that we weren&#39;t going to need energy for
[6298.32s] the next decade or two decades. I mean,
[6300.48s] you had to buy some of the story. It was
[6302.239s] so pronounced. It was so strong. The
[6305.52s] sentiment was so uniformly convinced
[6308.8s] that we were not going to use oil
[6310.48s] anymore and we were all going to be in
[6312.639s] electric vehicles. And I said,
[6315.0s] &quot;What if they&#39;re
[6317.32s] right, how do I participate and still
[6319.84s] make money?&quot; And I said, &quot;Let&#39;s just buy
[6323.119s] the one that will be left standing if
[6325.199s] they&#39;re right about everything. One of
[6326.719s] them is going to be left standing in the
[6328.719s] tradition in the transition. Let&#39;s buy
[6331.84s] Exxon Mobile at
[6334.6s] $33 a
[6336.52s] share. Paying a dividend. World is shut
[6340.28s] down. Not a complicated decision because
[6343.6s] if Exxon goes, I have a lot more to
[6346.08s] worry about than my stock portfolio
[6348.32s] because if we&#39;re not pumping energy and
[6350.32s] we&#39;re not keeping the lights on and uh
[6352.96s] people have stopped moving, you know,
[6354.719s] last thing I&#39;m going to be worried about
[6355.76s] is my stock portfolio. So, yeah.
[6360.0s] That&#39;s a good question. I don&#39;t Six or
[6362.48s] seven. You remember in the 40s? Yeah.
[6365.119s] Six or seven in the You bought it in the
[6366.639s] 40s. Yeah. So, it must have been eight.
[6368.8s] So, there was a real risk they were
[6370.0s] going to cut the dividend and I fully
[6371.92s] accepted that. I mean, any stock that
[6373.76s] drops that much. I&#39;m not buying for the
[6375.119s] dividend. I&#39;m buying for the turnaround.
[6376.88s] Every now and then, they keep the
[6378.159s] dividend. Like, uh, we didn&#39;t have time
[6379.76s] to talk uh Jeff had noted 4.4% 4%
[6383.52s] dividend yield on Stanley Black &amp; Decker
[6385.28s] right now and the stock is down 80% 80%.
[6389.44s] So might they cut it? Yeah. But the fact
[6392.239s] that they&#39;ve taken almost $2 billion of
[6393.92s] cost out of the business and the
[6395.119s] revenues are starting to reacelerate.
[6397.04s] You probably get that lock it in. They
[6398.96s] keep growing the dividend over
[6401.239s] time. They&#39;ve cut it a little bit. Yeah.
[6403.52s] Yeah. Yeah. So um Yeah. So what was it
[6406.48s] at peak, right? Like 8% or something.
[6408.8s] Yeah. When the stock had dropped. So
[6410.48s] that happens in those situations. But
[6412.639s] once the business stabilize, what do
[6414.32s] they start doing? Increasing the
[6416.0s] dividend again. So on your basis, it
[6418.88s] starts to really compound. I mean,
[6420.719s] Buffett gets annual
[6422.52s] dividends close
[6424.36s] to the total amount of basis he invested
[6427.679s] in Coca-Cola in
[6430.28s] 1989. It&#39;s unreal. And it keeps growing
[6432.88s] every single year with
[6435.48s] ah adjusted. It&#39;s It&#39;s complicated, but
[6439.44s] cheaper than now. I&#39;ll put it that way.
[6441.76s] Um, okay. So, that was Exxon, and we
[6444.88s] didn&#39;t get the the exact bottom. I think
[6446.639s] the bottom was
[6448.04s] $25. Um, we got it 33 blended, and we
[6452.08s] didn&#39;t get the top. Uh, I think we sold
[6454.239s] it below 100. It&#39;s
[6455.88s] now 105. But, you know, it wasn&#39;t a
[6460.84s] 10bagger. It wasn&#39;t Nvidia making 50
[6463.52s] times your money. that was like you
[6466.0s] don&#39;t have to think hard about. Another
[6467.44s] one we did during the uh COVID was Wells
[6471.96s] Fargo. Wells Fargo three times in
[6475.199s] history it traded below 50% of tangible
[6477.679s] book. Okay, we built a huge position at
[6481.48s] $2510. And if the world was going to
[6484.36s] end, our view was that
[6488.44s] probably JP
[6490.52s] Morgan, probably Wells
[6493.639s] Fargo and and possibly Bank of America
[6497.84s] would be left standing. Okay.
[6501.239s] Uh, so JP Morgan didn&#39;t come come down
[6505.28s] enough that we felt like we were getting
[6507.679s] paid for the amount of risk we were
[6509.119s] taking. Wells Fargo came down enough
[6511.28s] that we&#39;re like, &quot;Yeah, this this is not
[6514.159s] going to be hard.&quot; And it went up to the
[6516.639s] high 50s very very quickly, got out at
[6519.48s] 57 and that that&#39;s that. But we didn&#39;t
[6522.8s] have to think hard about that because if
[6524.96s] Wells Fargo ceased to exist, you know, I
[6528.08s] like to say that the end of the world
[6529.36s] only comes once. Uh and if it&#39;s now,
[6531.84s] don&#39;t worry about your stocks. Uh and if
[6534.8s] uh if Wells Fargo cease to exist, that
[6537.04s] would be as as close to the end of the
[6538.56s] world as you could get. So that was a
[6540.48s] no-brainer. Yeah.
[6544.52s] Uh we hold stocks between 12 one year
[6548.0s] and five years, but I&#39;d say three years
[6549.679s] is kind of the average uh turnaround
[6551.679s] period. Yeah. Some go super fast like
[6554.56s] Monado was a quick double. That was one
[6556.239s] of the few that did it in less than a
[6558.08s] year and that was frustrating because we
[6560.719s] had to pay taxes, but it wasn&#39;t
[6563.28s] something that was a hold forever stock
[6565.44s] and we&#39;re like, you know what, take the
[6567.199s] win and move on. But usually it&#39;s going
[6569.44s] to take well more than 12 months. So,
[6571.119s] we&#39;re we&#39;re comfortable to like Cooper
[6573.76s] Standard, we started building at $5 and
[6575.84s] change in May of
[6577.719s] 2022. Uh that&#39;s now a five bagger off
[6581.199s] those, but we&#39;re three years in and we
[6583.84s] don&#39;t even think the story&#39;s begun. We
[6585.28s] think it&#39;s going to double again from
[6586.4s] here. So, that&#39;s going to take probably
[6588.159s] five years till we&#39;re fully out or, you
[6591.6s] know, getting out. But
[6593.8s] the return on capital is insane. So
[6596.56s] we&#39;re always looking at the tradeoff for
[6600.239s] internal rate of return has to be in
[6603.199s] excess of what we&#39;re measured against.
[6605.36s] Uh so if that time creeps too long and
[6609.76s] it starts to impact our IR that&#39;s
[6611.36s] something we we&#39;re cognizant of and by
[6613.84s] the same token if the IRRa is insane in
[6616.0s] a short period of time we have to
[6617.36s] harvest some of that. Um it&#39;s a
[6619.52s] balancing act. It&#39;s uh they were asking
[6623.4s] earlier what&#39;s going to happen to
[6625.119s] analysts with AI and I said you know the
[6627.52s] mediocre ones are going to be toast but
[6630.0s] that type of analysis like it can be
[6632.119s] done by machines but there&#39;s so much
[6635.119s] nuance. I remember when I worked at
[6637.04s] Cornwall and I&#39;d like I&#39;d sit down with
[6640.4s] them and I&#39;d pitch him on an idea and my
[6643.28s] pitch would be
[6644.44s] like I don&#39;t know five minutes and then
[6648.8s] the guy who was played by Brad Pitt in
[6651.119s] the movie he would start asking me
[6653.96s] questions and it would be like four
[6656.56s] hours and he&#39;s like how come you just
[6660.239s] don&#39;t say all that stuff that&#39;s in your
[6662.159s] head?
[6663.84s] I was like, I don&#39;t know. It&#39;s just all
[6665.52s] processes like in my head all the time.
[6668.239s] So, um, I just give you the
[6671.159s] summary and I hope you, you know, you&#39;re
[6674.4s] thinking about all those things that I&#39;m
[6675.679s] thinking about and like he taught me to
[6677.199s] like take that stuff that&#39;s whirling
[6680.48s] around in there and kind of get it out a
[6682.08s] little bit more so people can understand
[6683.76s] it. Um, I&#39;m I&#39;m getting there. I&#39;m a
[6686.4s] work in progress. So, better investor
[6689.44s] than communicator. uh bet big tech bet
[6692.8s] tech bet in the 2022 bare market. Two
[6696.159s] things people think about Tom Hayes.
[6697.679s] Number one, they think I&#39;m a
[6699.639s] permable because they know me publicly
[6702.48s] since it&#39;s been time to be a permable.
[6705.119s] Uh and number two, they think I hate
[6706.719s] tech and I only buy
[6708.679s] factories and boring businesses. Uh and
[6712.48s] the answer is it couldn&#39;t be farther
[6713.92s] from the truth. I buy what&#39;s on sale
[6715.599s] that&#39;s high quality when it&#39;s on sale.
[6718.32s] And in this
[6720.52s] recent tech pullback, I would call it a
[6723.36s] pullback for Mag 7. The reason I didn&#39;t
[6725.599s] jump all over if if you had put a gun to
[6727.599s] my head in early April when we were
[6729.119s] buying a ton of stocks,
[6731.52s] um I think I even mentioned on the
[6733.36s] podcast like I could see a scenario
[6734.719s] where Mag 7 really
[6737.0s] moves. I don&#39;t think the underlying
[6739.599s] earnings power prospectively because the
[6741.92s] amount of capex they have and how that&#39;s
[6744.96s] going to crowd out buybacks
[6747.679s] uh is going to justify them trading
[6749.84s] above the top of the range. So on that
[6752.639s] basis for me to take that
[6755.56s] risk for only 30 to 40% quick
[6760.679s] return is not worth it. Like if
[6763.199s] something can&#39;t be a double or triple or
[6767.92s] quadruple in a reasonable amount of
[6769.679s] time, you know, handful of years or much
[6771.76s] less, I&#39;m not allocating a dollar of
[6774.32s] capital because I think in any
[6776.08s] investment there there&#39;s things you can
[6778.88s] know and there&#39;s things that
[6781.159s] you don&#39;t know that you don&#39;t know and
[6783.84s] maybe can&#39;t
[6785.08s] know. How many of you knew United
[6788.0s] Healthcare was committing Medicare
[6790.08s] fraud?
[6792.96s] If they were, we don&#39;t know yet. You&#39;re
[6796.159s] going to stick around and find out. I
[6798.159s] mean, if you&#39;re holding the stock and
[6800.48s] you&#39;re like, &quot;Well, I&#39;ll bet they didn&#39;t
[6802.96s] commit fraud and the DOJ is just going
[6805.44s] on a fishing expedition.&quot; It&#39;s like,
[6808.08s] &quot;That&#39;s kind of gambling.&quot; You know, I
[6810.0s] had clients ask me because I like to buy
[6811.52s] stocks. I was
[6813.8s] like, &quot;Under $200 a share? I might be
[6817.04s] willing to assume that gambling risk,
[6818.719s] but uh not yet.&quot; that could be a quick
[6822.36s] recovery. Uh but that goes in my two too
[6825.599s] hard box like I how can I have an edge?
[6828.96s] So the point I&#39;m making in that context
[6830.719s] is that&#39;s why you know our highest
[6832.32s] conviction idea is not 100% of the
[6834.0s] portfolio. Now we&#39;re concentrated 8 10
[6836.56s] 12 stocks
[6838.76s] uh but we accept the risk that any one
[6842.56s] of those stock so when I size positions
[6844.96s] here&#39;s another filter besides owning the
[6847.28s] entire business is if this position went
[6851.199s] to
[6852.36s] zero would they take me out on a
[6855.4s] stretcher and if the answer is yes the
[6857.76s] sizing is too
[6859.56s] large and I&#39;m I&#39;m being a cowboy so I&#39;ll
[6863.119s] never take that risk if The answer is
[6864.96s] no. The other nine positions in the
[6867.599s] portfolio are all going to be doubles
[6868.8s] and triples. If this goes to zero, it
[6870.48s] doesn&#39;t matter. I&#39;ll still outperform.
[6872.159s] Then the answer is yes. You&#39;re sizing it
[6873.679s] correctly. And you have to go into that
[6875.599s] assumption in every single investment
[6877.84s] that there could be things that you
[6879.599s] don&#39;t know that you don&#39;t know. UNH is a
[6882.0s] monstrous business. This is not some
[6884.32s] shy, you know, insurance agent on the
[6886.8s] corner selling away some policy that
[6889.28s] they shouldn&#39;t have sold. This is like
[6891.92s] serious stuff and you have to have that
[6894.32s] assumption. So if everyone is crowding
[6896.639s] into one stock and you&#39;re like, &quot;Oh, if
[6897.92s] I just buy you that stock,&quot; that&#39;s how
[6900.159s] you really get hurt. So you even no
[6902.32s] matter how good your research is, no
[6904.48s] matter how high your conviction, no
[6906.08s] matter how high the margin of safety is
[6909.28s] in the business, there can always be a
[6911.28s] risk that you don&#39;t know that you don&#39;t
[6912.8s] know. And there&#39;s no way you could
[6914.08s] possibly know. No matter how good you&#39;re
[6915.599s] you are as an analyst, it&#39;s just a black
[6917.76s] swan. think they&#39;re in the Dow. Sorry.
[6920.48s] Might get kicked out.
[6922.96s] Uh I don&#39;t know. But if they did get
[6925.199s] kicked out, it would take a while. And
[6927.679s] those stocks have a tendency to
[6929.199s] outperform in the next 12 months. So
[6931.119s] that would probably be a trigger for me
[6932.48s] to take a closer look. I got to be
[6933.84s] honest with you. Um so 2022 marked the
[6937.119s] third worst year ever for tech. Only
[6939.679s] behind the dot crash and the great
[6941.36s] financial crisis. Nearly 2.5 trillion in
[6944.0s] market value was wiped out and tech
[6946.4s] layoffs at their highest level since
[6948.239s] 2000. The post-pandemic capex and hiring
[6950.639s] spree in tech was quickly replaced by
[6952.4s] the fastest Fed tighten tightening
[6955.159s] cycle since the 1980s ending ZERP zero
[6959.44s] interest rate policy. And we&#39;ve covered
[6960.96s] that in my panel on Friday. We covered
[6963.199s] that a little today. If you are going to
[6965.28s] be exclusively growth because that&#39;s
[6967.679s] what&#39;s worked in the last 15 years, you
[6970.4s] are making an implicit bet that you
[6972.8s] believe rates are going back down to 2%
[6974.96s] or 1%. Because historically that is when
[6978.0s] growth
[6979.159s] outperforms and you&#39;re like, well, there
[6981.36s] haven&#39;t been that many periods that
[6984.08s] rates have been at 1% or 2%. Well, news
[6986.96s] flash, there haven&#39;t been that many
[6988.56s] periods where growth has outperformed
[6990.0s] value. It just happens to be the last 15
[6992.239s] years. You know, it&#39;s funny. I talked to
[6994.8s] a new client. I said, uh, I said, &#39;
[6996.88s] Let&#39;s turn this around. You want me to
[6998.08s] grow your money, right? Like, yes. I
[7000.56s] said, how about if we did an exercise
[7003.76s] and you came to me and you said, Tom,
[7005.679s] I&#39;ve got $10 million. I want to see how
[7008.48s] quickly you can lose it in 24 months.
[7011.52s] I&#39;d say, no problem. Here&#39;s how you do
[7013.199s] it. All you have to do is buy a basket
[7017.44s] of 20 stocks trading at 10 times sales
[7020.96s] or greater and making no money. And I
[7024.08s] guarantee you&#39;re going to lose 90% of
[7025.679s] your money in the next 24
[7027.96s] months except the last 15
[7032.04s] years. That basket of stocks has
[7034.32s] outperformed the S&amp;P 500. Every other
[7037.28s] 10-year period before ZERP, you were
[7039.84s] guaranteed to lose 90% of your money.
[7041.92s] That was like a no-brainer. And now
[7043.84s] that&#39;s all anyone&#39;s excited to buy.
[7049.52s] Ria,
[7051.119s] an RAIA usually is doing like estate
[7054.32s] planning. They&#39;re doing uh when are you
[7057.36s] going to retire? What you know planning
[7059.92s] goals for your kids. I come from a hedge
[7062.159s] fund manager background. So we run the
[7064.239s] same strategies. Uh concentrated
[7066.8s] portfolio 85 90% 8 to 10 to 12 stocks.
[7070.719s] 10 to 15% is in a derivative overlay for
[7073.36s] excess returns without drawing major
[7075.199s] leverage. And we also use that bucket
[7077.119s] for hedging and dampening volatility
[7079.04s] from time to time when we think the
[7081.04s] market is dramatically overvalued but
[7082.8s] there are no companies that we&#39;re ready
[7084.48s] to harvest yet. We&#39;ll use that to to do
[7087.28s] some hedging as
[7088.76s] well. Okay. Um so we saw the panic as a
[7093.96s] generational okay post pandemic capex
[7097.199s] hiring spree. We saw that as a
[7099.119s] generational buy opportunity picking up
[7100.639s] Amazon during its worst year since 20
[7102.96s] 2000 and Google after both were cut in
[7107.199s] half that year. This was Google and
[7110.0s] Amazon cut in half. now
[7113.04s] um and investors puked in the hole and
[7115.28s] you couldn&#39;t give away a tech stock
[7116.96s] because what free money all the VC money
[7119.84s] crowded in in 2021
[7122.96s] uh chasing ridiculous ideas and
[7125.119s] ridiculous deals that weren&#39;t making
[7126.76s] money as you got forced liquidations and
[7129.599s] the business plans didn&#39;t play out.
[7131.679s] These were a source of funds for many
[7133.84s] private
[7139.639s] investors. Those were a double in about
[7141.84s] a year and a half. Both stocks are
[7144.88s] essentially flat since we
[7148.52s] exited.
[7150.599s] Okay. Now, the most uninvestable
[7154.8s] opportunity
[7155.96s] ever is
[7158.119s] China. And uh this is one of the
[7161.76s] category that takes longer than
[7163.52s] expected. This has not been a vornnado.
[7166.719s] Okay? This has been a multi-year thing.
[7171.159s] We started in the hundreds
[7174.4s] uh and we bought all the way down to the
[7176.8s] 60s. And that was a scary day. I
[7179.44s] remember because it went to 59. Rob
[7181.199s] probably remembers it. Remembers the
[7183.36s] podcast. Rob&#39;s been listening to the
[7184.719s] podcast for three plus years. Jeff
[7187.52s] probably remembers it. Um and we brought
[7191.44s] our basis across all accounts down to
[7193.76s] $82 and change.
[7197.04s] And um and the reason we were able to do
[7200.08s] that is because no leverage. No one took
[7202.8s] the decision out of our hands as it was
[7204.8s] collapsing because Xihinping was
[7207.199s] soldering people into their homes in
[7209.36s] their apartments so they couldn&#39;t leave
[7210.719s] their apartments during COVID. I mean,
[7213.88s] but they were still generating $20
[7216.32s] billion of free cash flow. Had eight
[7218.32s] billion $80 billion of cash on their
[7220.4s] balance sheet. So did they have the
[7223.48s] runway? Yes. effectively no net no net
[7227.84s] debt because they had $80 billion of
[7229.679s] cash and I think it was like what $18
[7231.679s] billion of debt at the time something
[7233.199s] like that so they had the runway they
[7235.76s] still had the growth they still had the
[7237.36s] free cash flow what they didn&#39;t have
[7242.04s] was investor flows foreign investor
[7245.04s] flows they didn&#39;t have uh excitement
[7247.76s] they didn&#39;t have FOMO but that&#39;s when we
[7249.36s] like to to buy
[7250.76s] stocks okay uh you can see all the
[7253.599s] headlines there were 35
[7256.36s] 35
[7257.96s] consecutive 135 weeks of negative
[7261.44s] headlines about China and
[7264.28s] Alibaba. 135 weeks from one single
[7269.719s] journalist. Okay.
[7272.44s] Now, I won&#39;t say anything about this
[7274.88s] journalist, but I will say it would be
[7277.04s] the equivalent
[7279.199s] uh where this where this journalist was
[7281.44s] from would be the equivalent of having a
[7283.88s] Palestinian write articles about Israeli
[7286.639s] breakthrough tech companies. Okay,
[7288.48s] you&#39;re not going to get a positive
[7290.239s] article out of this one. And it was just
[7292.639s] going on and on and on. So, these were
[7294.639s] uninvestable for nearly four years,
[7296.56s] three years. And she wasn&#39;t the only
[7297.92s] one. uh every journalist and every sell
[7300.96s] side and everyone investor was negative
[7303.679s] on
[7305.08s] China. So let&#39;s take a look
[7307.88s] at perception versus
[7310.84s] reality. Okay, you know the story about
[7312.96s] the the the peak is when they canled the
[7316.239s] ant group
[7318.04s] IPO. Okay. And Xihinping, not Xihinping.
[7322.08s] Jackma Ma went into hiding became enemy
[7325.28s] number one because he spoke poorly about
[7329.719s] Xihinping. And we had the threats of
[7332.239s] dlisting the stock in the US. They had
[7334.639s] to go through the
[7335.88s] PCAOB report.
[7338.96s] They passed that with flying colors only
[7340.88s] to get new headlines during China
[7342.88s] negotiations this year about delisting
[7345.599s] because Rick Scott has a problem with
[7347.599s] Chinese companies uh because the new SEC
[7351.28s] chair uh was very tight on votes and
[7354.4s] Rick Scott said you want my vote you got
[7356.0s] to look into this. So we switched all
[7357.599s] our shares from US listings to Hong
[7360.159s] Kong. I think now that the Chinese
[7362.48s] negotiations are going well, I think
[7364.32s] that was a
[7365.32s] leverage point that they were playing
[7367.36s] because if they actually delisted US
[7370.76s] ads, all they heard is US investors.
[7373.28s] They would torpedo $800 billion of US
[7375.44s] investors cash, the Chinese don&#39;t get
[7377.76s] hurt. They don&#39;t own it in they don&#39;t
[7379.44s] own US ADRs. So, uh, I think it was on
[7383.32s] purpose with the intent to kind of
[7387.04s] threaten the Chinese government that if
[7388.96s] you don&#39;t come to the table, you&#39;re
[7390.96s] going to lose access to the US capital
[7392.8s] markets. That that&#39;s my take. That said,
[7395.04s] I made the move anyway to protect my
[7396.639s] investors capital. That&#39;s my number one
[7398.239s] responsibility. We still own derivatives
[7400.48s] in the US because that&#39;s a risk we&#39;re
[7402.08s] willing to assume in that 10% bucket.
[7404.32s] any position we put on um for excess
[7407.44s] returns uh will accept that risk because
[7410.8s] the underlying stock position will more
[7413.76s] than make up for that many full times
[7416.639s] but we want to keep that expression
[7419.04s] because we can&#39;t replicate it in Hong
[7420.56s] Kong. We can replicate the stock
[7421.92s] position in Hong Kong. So for simplicity
[7424.52s] sake all this is probably noise. The the
[7427.84s] odds of them delisting are very low in
[7430.88s] my opinion but it&#39;s not nothing. So if
[7432.88s] you want a a
[7434.76s] more as riskless as you can get while
[7437.92s] still assuming any risk with investing
[7440.0s] you can through interactive brokers you
[7441.599s] can just buy the ticker 9988 instead of
[7444.08s] buying
[7445.8s] BABA.
[7451.48s] Okay. So china&#39;s rapid economic
[7454.159s] expansion has been driven by increased
[7455.599s] manufacturing and production while we&#39;re
[7457.599s] relying on an investment growth model.
[7459.679s] consumption makes up 55% of GDP in China
[7462.719s] compared to 70% in wealthier nations. US
[7465.599s] households consume 12 times the nominal
[7467.599s] dollar amount of their Chinese
[7468.76s] counterparts. China&#39;s made boosting
[7470.88s] domestic consumption a top economic
[7473.199s] priority in the last 12 months, aiming
[7475.84s] for 70% by 2035.
[7480.56s] To put it in perspective, China&#39;s 2024
[7483.199s] GDP was $18 trillion with consumption at
[7486.599s] 55%, which is 10.3 trillion if they grow
[7489.92s] 5% this year and then slow to 3%
[7492.639s] annually through 2025, hitting the 70%
[7495.599s] consumption target would mean 18.5
[7498.239s] trillion in annual consumption by 2035.
[7502.639s] That&#39;s an 8.23 trillion jump.
[7507.08s] Alibaba has 40% of the Chinese
[7511.28s] e-commerce market. So this is what we
[7514.4s] call ladies and gentlemen a toll
[7517.719s] taker. Okay. The government is now
[7521.04s] mandated that consumption is their
[7523.119s] number one
[7524.52s] priority and Alibaba is going to get a
[7527.52s] piece of that action that the
[7528.639s] government&#39;s going to push. Okay. And
[7530.56s] when the Chinese government makes
[7532.239s] something their priority, you remember
[7533.679s] solar
[7534.52s] panels, you remember EVs, okay, there&#39;s
[7537.84s] 60% of global EV markets and now it&#39;s
[7540.4s] consumption. They want to get that 20
[7541.679s] trillion of savings circulating in their
[7544.4s] market so they&#39;re less dependent on
[7545.92s] exports. On the flip side, the US, you
[7549.119s] can see it makes perfect sense that we
[7551.76s] would do a rebalance because we have
[7553.36s] such a we want to increase our
[7555.04s] manufacturing. This is the red line.
[7557.599s] Okay, this is consumption. This is
[7559.119s] manufacturing in the US. This is
[7561.44s] consumption in China versus
[7563.4s] manufacturing. They just want to kind of
[7565.28s] normalize. Bring this down a little bit.
[7567.28s] Bring this up a little bit. Bring this
[7568.639s] up a little bit. Maybe keep this up.
[7570.88s] Maybe it goes back a little bit. And
[7572.88s] that&#39;s a natural healthy thing and
[7575.44s] that&#39;s the purpose of the trade
[7577.08s] talks. So, uh, politicians will always
[7580.239s] do the right thing after exhausting all
[7581.84s] other options and that&#39;s exactly what
[7584.32s] Xiinping did. uh he ca he did a policy
[7587.76s] 180 after youth unemployment topped 20
[7590.88s] it was actually 25% some say 40% but
[7594.239s] more than that is when unrest hit the
[7597.119s] streets and when we saw the data on the
[7600.079s] number of protests we knew we were at an
[7602.4s] inflection because either he changed or
[7604.4s] they would change him and
[7607.639s] um and he changed and he pivoted and it
[7610.4s] was done overnight he&#39;s been stimulating
[7612.56s] ever since the numbers are slowly
[7614.96s] improveving improving in pits and starts
[7616.32s] and for Baba they&#39;re improving
[7618.0s] materially. Even this most recent
[7619.679s] earnings report I wrote some notes that
[7622.639s] I left on the other stage but uh you
[7626.079s] know Taobal and T-
[7627.719s] mall which is their retail up 12% yearon
[7631.84s] year. That&#39;s hard when you&#39;re number one
[7633.36s] in the market to get that level of
[7634.96s] growth 12%. cloud business number one
[7639.28s] compute power they&#39;ve got 40% of the
[7641.599s] cloud market Jeff 36% okay so they&#39;re
[7645.36s] the number one cloud provider compute
[7649.28s] uh Beijing&#39;s pivoted from tech
[7651.36s] crackdowns to open support Jackm&#39;s
[7653.36s] public return and front row handshake
[7656.239s] sent a clear message the private sector
[7658.32s] is back in favor and seen as a key
[7659.92s] partner in economic in China&#39;s economic
[7662.0s] future that was not the case when we
[7663.76s] bought the
[7664.599s] stock Okay, that&#39;s why we have a blended
[7667.199s] basis of $82 versus 125 or 130 wherever
[7670.8s] it is now and going over 200.
[7675.56s] Plus, Ji Singh uh Xi sees private tech
[7679.28s] as a key to his 2030 goals to lead in
[7682.079s] semiconductors, energy, AI. China needs
[7684.8s] more entrepreneurs on board, calling
[7686.32s] this the right time for private
[7688.96s] enterprises to fully display their
[7690.56s] talents. you know, after 2030, he may go
[7693.679s] back to being uh unfriendly, but right
[7697.119s] now he knows in order to stay in power
[7698.639s] and deliver, he needs to do this. So,
[7700.88s] China&#39;s stimulus plan targets the 20
[7702.88s] trillion in household savings. People
[7704.88s] have been saving money because they&#39;ve
[7706.32s] been scared because the policies
[7707.679s] policies are changing. The consumer is
[7709.84s] thawing and that money is going to wind
[7711.92s] up. action plan for boosting consumption
[7713.84s] includes a 4% budget deficit, moderately
[7716.4s] loose monetary policy, u reserve ratio
[7720.639s] requirement cuts, lower rates, trade-in
[7722.96s] programs, and statebacked stock buying.
[7725.84s] They&#39;re actually like the Japanese in
[7727.599s] the market buying stocks to prop up the
[7729.599s] market right now. And if you want to
[7731.599s] move the market, what&#39;s the number one
[7732.88s] stock you want to buy? The heaviest
[7734.4s] waiting in all the indices, okay? Your
[7737.52s] Alibabas of the world and your 10 cents
[7739.28s] of the world. If you move those stocks,
[7740.639s] you move your market. If you move your
[7742.079s] market, more FOMO comes in from outside
[7744.639s] investors. And that&#39;s explicitly what
[7746.56s] they&#39;re doing. They&#39;re not even hiding
[7747.679s] it under the table. We are buying
[7749.719s] stocks. So, do you want to get in front
[7751.76s] of that freight train or ignore that
[7753.119s] freight train? Uh, the Japanese did it.
[7755.36s] You saw what happened to their markets
[7756.639s] two years ago.
[7758.84s] Okay. So, you see that they&#39;re running
[7761.28s] the highest deficit. They&#39;re running
[7763.28s] their deficit at the highest level in
[7765.639s] decades. This is deficit spending to
[7768.52s] spur growth.
[7771.599s] M2 money supply globally. If you look at
[7774.639s] the pull up the chart, go to Google when
[7776.4s] you go home, you&#39;re going to see that it
[7778.48s] troughed and it&#39;s going straight up
[7780.56s] again. And all of that increase in money
[7783.44s] supply, all that stimulative stuff, it&#39;s
[7786.56s] not coming from the US. We&#39;re cutting
[7788.0s] spending. It&#39;s coming from China. M2
[7791.199s] money supply, that equals liquidity.
[7792.719s] That means asset prices go up. And it&#39;s
[7795.28s] all centered in China. So, if you don&#39;t
[7796.88s] have I understand being nervous about
[7798.8s] China, but if you don&#39;t have like some
[7800.719s] exposure, even if you buy an ETF, my uh
[7804.48s] friend Brendan Ahern runs KB, which is a
[7806.88s] China ETF. Uh I think 86% of his
[7810.56s] holdings are held in China. He still has
[7812.159s] like 14% in the US that he can&#39;t get in
[7814.239s] China. Uh but for
[7816.199s] me, this is the best asymmetric reward.
[7819.679s] And if I&#39;m going to risk a dollar of
[7820.88s] capital, I need a double plus. And this
[7824.159s] is this is where you get it. If you own
[7825.599s] a basket, it&#39;s very hard to get those
[7827.28s] type of
[7828.52s] returns. Uh return of foreign capital,
[7831.119s] foreign inflows remain at historic lows.
[7833.84s] Very similar to energy in 2020, the
[7837.199s] waitings of China equities and all the
[7839.28s] international funds, the flows into the
[7841.8s] sector. It&#39;s exact. I I I don&#39;t know if
[7845.119s] this is worse or energy was worse in
[7847.44s] 2020 because in 2020, the narrative was
[7849.92s] so clear like windmills and solar panels
[7851.92s] and like if you use oil, you&#39;re going to
[7854.0s] hell. I mean that was basically uh
[7856.56s] permeated everything. I think with China
[7859.119s] people are just a little nervous until
[7860.48s] they see some price go up is basically
[7863.44s] all the analysts. There&#39;s one major
[7865.92s] sellside bank which I won&#39;t name. They
[7868.88s] were
[7869.8s] aggressively aggressively downgrading
[7872.56s] Alibaba at $60 and they&#39;re now
[7876.079s] aggressively upgrading it at $125 and
[7878.639s] change. The consensus price target has
[7880.32s] gone from like 80 to $175 now. And now
[7884.239s] there was another firm out on Friday at
[7886.639s] $190. And when it goes over 200, they&#39;ll
[7889.119s] all move it up to 250. And that&#39;s that&#39;s
[7891.84s] how it works. They blow with the wind.
[7893.96s] Opinion follows trend.
[7898.199s] Okay. Uh foreign investor exposure to
[7901.28s] the second world&#39;s second largest
[7902.719s] economy sits near record lows at 5% down
[7905.36s] from 14%. Remember where I was talking
[7907.679s] about the waiting of energy in 2020? It
[7909.92s] went from 10% down to 3%. That&#39;s usually
[7913.76s] the low. Okay. When when the weights
[7916.0s] drop by 66%
[7918.4s] uh whether it&#39;s a sector within the
[7920.4s] index or in this case China within the
[7923.04s] international index, you can see here
[7925.119s] the extremity of where we are right now.
[7928.88s] It&#39;s very much like uh you&#39;d have to go
[7931.599s] back to 2021 to see that. Or you could
[7934.8s] look at this was a monster rally in
[7936.88s] Chinese stocks when it bottomed out here
[7939.119s] like it seems to be bottoming out right
[7940.719s] now. Yeah. Go ahead.
[7960.0s] pretty much every red day for two years
[7961.679s] I bought stock.
[7966.8s] Oh, we have size limits. So, we&#39;ll never
[7968.56s] go above like our our biggest position
[7971.44s] ever. We did that two times. Um we did
[7976.4s] it with Wells Fargo during the pandemic.
[7978.96s] We went up to 20%.
[7981.199s] And that was a quick double and we we
[7983.44s] did it with Baba and now Cooper Standard
[7985.36s] because it&#39;s gone up 5x has become a
[7987.119s] huge part of the portfolios. Huge huge.
[7989.44s] So we have to we have to constantly
[7992.679s] assess the current weight as these
[7994.96s] things go up in price. I mean you know
[7996.96s] Baba has now moved up from 82 basis to
[8000.719s] 125 and going. So it&#39;s making up bigger
[8002.96s] and bigger weights over time. So we have
[8006.159s] to constantly monitor it. But the answer
[8007.599s] to your question is I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve
[8009.52s] ever bought a stock on a green day.
[8018.04s] Yeah. Yeah. Stopped out in terms of what
[8021.36s] the risk I&#39;m willing to
[8023.88s] take.
[8025.4s] Um All right. So this
[8028.84s] shows revenues cash flow and these are
[8031.36s] type of things I like to look at. This
[8032.719s] is just a page from value line and you
[8034.8s] can see over time what&#39;s happening to
[8036.239s] the revenues per share, what&#39;s happening
[8037.599s] to the cash flow per share, what&#39;s
[8038.96s] happening to the earnings per share. And
[8040.719s] what&#39;s interesting is if you actually
[8042.159s] look at that for good businesses that
[8044.48s] line tends to be like in a bad period
[8046.32s] it&#39;ll be flat. In a in normal periods,
[8049.28s] it goes like this and then stock price
[8051.52s] goes like this around the actual
[8053.44s] fundamentals of the business. And what
[8054.88s] we try to do is we try to buy when price
[8057.04s] is here, but fundamentals are still
[8058.56s] here. And we try to sell when price is
[8060.56s] here and everyone&#39;s excited and there&#39;s
[8062.199s] headlines and uh people who hated it
[8065.44s] down here are on stage in the main room
[8067.44s] loving it up here. You you&#39;ll probably
[8069.52s] have some people pitching Baba next year
[8071.28s] at $200. I&#39;ll be if we have a if we have
[8074.4s] a presentation, if we have a a money
[8077.56s] show, I would definitely say 18 months
[8080.0s] from
[8081.48s] now, there&#39;s going to be a speaker on
[8084.4s] stage pitching Baba over $200. It will
[8087.92s] not be
[8088.84s] me. I&#39;ll be waiting for him to get it
[8091.84s] over 250 and I will be helping out his
[8094.159s] audience get as many shares as they
[8096.4s] like.
[8101.44s] So, write that down. Put it in your
[8103.28s] Google calendar. It&#39;s coming to a
[8105.36s] theater near
[8106.92s] you. All right, Alibaba, we covered
[8109.96s] that. All right, I want you to
[8112.32s] understand this concept is critical. So,
[8114.239s] we talked about fundamentals versus
[8115.8s] price. Um, you can buy this stock
[8119.28s] effectively at 2014 prices. The
[8122.84s] difference today is that the revenue per
[8126.0s] share is up, 1100%.
[8129.199s] The cash flow per share is up 500%, the
[8131.84s] earnings per share are up
[8133.719s] 500%. And the stock is effectively
[8136.92s] flat. The one other stock I can think of
[8139.44s] that h experienced this type of improved
[8142.36s] fundamentals with no improvement in
[8145.119s] price until it all improved at once is
[8148.679s] Microsoft. Microsoft from 2006 to
[8153.159s] 2013 they grew revenues by 112%.
[8158.159s] They grew cash flow per share by almost
[8161.0s] 200%. And they grew earnings by 120%.
[8164.0s] The stock did
[8165.4s] nothing. In the following 10 years, it
[8167.679s] was up
[8168.679s] 1500%. And if you look at the
[8171.48s] fundamentals, everyone says, &quot;Well,
[8173.199s] Satia, Satia changed the world, blah
[8174.88s] blah blah.&quot; His improvement in revenue
[8177.199s] per share, cash flow per share, and
[8178.4s] earnings per share is not much better
[8180.719s] than Steve Balmer&#39;s was, except he got
[8183.599s] multiple expansion, and the stock went
[8185.119s] up 1500%. And and and that&#39;s what I talk
[8187.599s] about opinion follows trend. You&#39;re
[8189.84s] going to see the same thing with
[8191.199s] Alibaba. You&#39;re going to see the same
[8192.719s] thing with Cooper. You&#39;re already seeing
[8194.08s] with Cooper Standard is that when the
[8196.88s] price goes up a lot, everyone gets
[8198.399s] excited and they jump on the train.
[8200.639s] Okay? And the same thing is going to
[8202.16s] happen. What&#39;s what&#39;s dispondent now?
[8203.76s] Dispondency turns into euphoria. It&#39;s
[8205.84s] the extreme. Like Warren Buffett always
[8207.76s] taught from Ben Graham, the market is a
[8210.08s] manic depressive. Okay? It&#39;s it&#39;s one
[8212.88s] day the business is the same. In the
[8215.519s] short term it&#39;s a voting machine based
[8217.12s] on emotions. In the long term it&#39;s a
[8219.04s] weighing machine based on fundamentals.
[8221.439s] So that manic depressive if you can buy
[8224.719s] stocks from the market on its depressive
[8226.639s] days and sell stocks to the market on
[8228.96s] its euphoria days that&#39;s where you make
[8231.359s] your bones. Yes ma&#39;am.
[8237.84s] Yeah.
[8240.96s] Yeah. I I that&#39;s we tend to use that to
[8244.96s] enhance returns but you have to have a
[8247.76s] core underlying position as your core
[8250.319s] position because you can&#39;t be certain
[8253.12s] about the timing of your view even if
[8254.96s] it&#39;s a year or two years because look
[8256.8s] you could have done that in in Microsoft
[8258.8s] you&#39;re like wow they&#39;ve doubled their
[8260.24s] revenues they&#39;ve doubled their cash flow
[8262.0s] and you bought those options in 2014 by
[8265.439s] 2015 it hadn&#39;t moved and then from 2017
[8268.88s] to 2020 you made 15 times your And the
[8271.599s] options would have been
[8275.16s] up 50
[8277.24s] times. Yeah. But you would have gotten
[8279.76s] stopped out two or three times before
[8281.679s] that. That&#39;s why you start with the core
[8283.319s] position. So as the stock was slowly
[8285.76s] going up and your options kept expiring,
[8287.439s] you were making money and you could
[8288.639s] reload if you wanted
[8290.2s] to. But if you just do options, right,
[8293.599s] and you and you get the wrong year or
[8295.679s] two
[8296.679s] years, you&#39;re wiped out, right? So you
[8299.519s] do stock primarily and then add some
[8301.679s] excess for for some excess returns in
[8303.84s] the way that you position it based on
[8305.76s] option pricing volatility and that type
[8307.519s] of stuff. But your your thinking is
[8309.12s] correct. But just start with the stock.
[8311.2s] Don&#39;t try to get rich overnight. Buy the
[8313.599s] stock. I&#39;m going to own this thing until
[8315.2s] it reaches intrinsic value. And if you
[8317.359s] want to add excess returns, do that. Uh
[8319.359s] I think we&#39;re pretty much uh done. I
[8321.439s] want to open for one or two questions
[8322.639s] because we ran over. Uh just to give you
[8324.96s] an idea, chat GPT is valued at $300
[8328.0s] billion in its latest round. Uh that&#39;s
[8330.8s] the whole market cap of
[8332.28s] Alibaba. The difference is that Alibaba
[8335.519s] generated 17.8 billion in net income
[8338.639s] this year. Uh Open AI is lucky if they
[8342.24s] do 13 billion of revenues, never mind
[8345.479s] earnings. Okay, so that&#39;s OpenAI is an
[8348.319s] example of euphoria.
[8350.399s] Uh, Alibaba right now is an example
[8352.88s] still of
[8354.76s] dispondency. Sell euphoria by
[8356.8s] dispondency. It&#39;s a good
[8359.319s] formula. China&#39;s the number one AI
[8362.08s] global AI play. The most AI you can get
[8364.319s] for the least amount of money. Their
[8365.599s] large language models have been proven
[8367.359s] competitive and better than deepseeek
[8369.359s] and open AI on many accounts. And for
[8372.08s] compute, they give all the pretty much
[8374.16s] every AI startup in China goes through
[8376.719s] Alibaba, number one cloud player. They
[8379.2s] say, &quot;We need compute power.&quot; Alibaba
[8381.12s] says, &quot;No problem. We give it to you for
[8382.719s] free like every good drug dealer. Give
[8384.319s] you a free sample.&quot; And then they say,
[8386.08s] &quot;Just give us equity.&quot; And they have
[8387.84s] free equity in all the AI startups in
[8389.92s] China. So it&#39;s almost like an AI ETF by
[8392.24s] owning
[8393.479s] Alibaba. Cloud revenue up 18% plus. So
[8397.76s] all of them are hitting on on uh every
[8400.64s] cylinders. we like a lot about. You got
[8402.479s] the e-commerce, you got the uh the cloud
[8405.439s] compute, you&#39;ve got the AI play, you
[8408.08s] have uh Tao and T- mall a play on the
[8412.68s] government initiative to get that $20
[8416.56s] trillion of savings circulating. Alibaba
[8419.439s] is the toll taker. Uh middle class
[8421.92s] recovery
[8423.72s] play and for the first time ever,
[8427.04s] mainland Chinese stocks could buy
[8428.8s] Alibaba through the stock connect. So,
[8430.64s] imagine if you&#39;re getting three Amazon
[8433.04s] boxes at your door for the last 10
[8434.479s] years, but the US government said you
[8436.319s] couldn&#39;t own Alib uh couldn&#39;t own Amazon
[8438.399s] and all of a sudden they said, you know,
[8440.0s] that company you&#39;re sending all your
[8441.12s] money to and they send you boxes. Uh you
[8443.52s] can own some equity in that company. And
[8445.439s] that&#39;s exactly what happened. Analyst
[8447.439s] analysts estimate 20 billion dollars in
[8449.84s] potential inflows from new buyers. I
[8452.08s] think we&#39;re at uh
[8454.439s] already eight billion or something like
[8456.64s] that just in the last six months.
[8458.399s] Something like that. So, the game&#39;s just
[8460.72s] beginning. You&#39;re getting another source
[8461.92s] of buyers until the foreign buyers start
[8463.68s] to step in on top of it. Um, by the way,
[8467.2s] owning China as a pension manager and a
[8472.16s] large asset manager was like owning
[8474.64s] energy in 2020. Now, if you if you
[8477.92s] didn&#39;t own an energy in the last year or
[8480.24s] so, you underperformed. So, they all all
[8482.479s] owned energy. So, they sell the bottom,
[8484.0s] they buy the top. Opinion follows trend.
[8487.6s] tariff exposure. Less than 1% of
[8489.439s] Alibaba&#39;s 134 billion in revenue came
[8491.84s] from the US, so it&#39;s a
[8494.12s] non-issue. Uh, the D-listing would only
[8496.399s] hurt Americans. And this is how you
[8498.479s] contact me. So, a lot of you ask me,
[8500.72s] podcast name is Hedge Fund Tips with Tom
[8502.479s] Hayes. I recommend you watch on YouTube.
[8504.16s] You&#39;ll get more value, but listen if you
[8505.76s] like to walk or play golf. Uh, Twitter,
[8508.96s] hedge fun
[8510.04s] tips. Tik Tok for all of you. Uh,
[8514.479s] official hedge fund tips. I&#39;m very
[8517.28s] popular with the Tik Tok
[8519.16s] crowd. Uh YouTube headphone tips is the
[8523.399s] channel and that&#39;s my email and contact
[8526.52s] information. Any questions? Yeah.
[8545.92s] Yeah.
[8548.64s] Yeah. I think for Generrack uh it is
[8551.68s] seasonal and none of their guidance
[8554.24s] includes any type of
[8558.12s] uh extreme events and there&#39;s usually
[8560.72s] always an extreme event at this time of
[8562.399s] year. So they don&#39;t put it in. So they
[8564.399s] could they what we call sandbag. They
[8566.8s] very conservative on the guidance. Um
[8569.04s] you know we look we started building
[8570.64s] that thing. We had a basis below 100. It
[8573.52s] shot up to 194. It&#39;s come down to 124.
[8577.6s] It&#39;s not changed our view on the stock.
[8579.359s] It&#39;s just how it recovers. Thing had a
[8581.84s] heart attack. You know when you have a
[8584.08s] heart attack you get off the table. You
[8586.0s] don&#39;t run a marathon. You go out. You
[8588.16s] walk around with the pole. You let go of
[8590.399s] the pole. You think you&#39;re okay. You
[8591.76s] fall on the floor. or they&#39;re like go
[8593.04s] back to the poll for a little while. I
[8595.12s] mean 80% down is a heart attack. Okay.
[8598.16s] So now they&#39;re walking again with the
[8599.76s] pole and they&#39;re going to try again and
[8601.2s] then they&#39;re going to do better. And
[8603.28s] this happens. It is a very cyclical
[8605.04s] business because uh in in some of our
[8607.68s] video cast we&#39;ve gone through the cycles
[8609.6s] where they have the revenue declines and
[8610.96s] the cash flow declines and then it
[8612.16s] starts to reacelerate. But if you look
[8613.76s] at that slide I did in the last
[8615.08s] presentation cash flow is nearing record
[8617.2s] highs and the price the stock price is
[8618.8s] still down some 80%. This is a uh this
[8621.92s] is like, you know, Buffett talks about
[8623.6s] the fat pitch. Wait for the fat pitch.
[8625.12s] For me, this is a complete no-brainer.
[8629.28s] Yeah. So, they&#39;ve bought back uh we had
[8633.04s] we skipped through the slide, but
[8634.72s] they&#39;ve got 20 billion more on their
[8636.479s] buyback. They they&#39;ve been buying in
[8638.399s] tons and tons of stocks for the last few
[8639.84s] years. They started paying a dividend.
[8641.12s] They just announced a special dividend.
[8643.28s] Uh so, we&#39;re not in it for the dividend.
[8645.76s] It&#39;s nice to see them returning capital.
[8647.2s] They&#39;re going to continue. They the
[8649.2s] interesting thing difference between US
[8650.96s] managers and Chinese managers. The
[8653.359s] Chinese to their credit were buying
[8656.479s] every share they could get their hands
[8657.92s] on below 100 in the hole. Whereas US
[8662.24s] managers after the stocks up 10x they
[8664.56s] start b announcing big back by big
[8666.96s] buybacks so that there&#39;s liquidity for
[8669.359s] them to sell their own options. And it&#39;s
[8672.08s] a completely different mindset. So the
[8673.52s] Chinese buy low and sell high. the uh
[8676.0s] American managers for the most part when
[8677.92s] the stock collapses they&#39;re not in the
[8679.6s] market buying. So we&#39;re happy that
[8681.6s] they&#39;re doing it and uh their buyback
[8685.24s] rate is slowing in the 120s which I&#39;m
[8688.56s] very happy to see. I love that they were
[8691.359s] buying handover fist in the in the 80s
[8693.52s] and 70s and they they still have uh 20
[8696.08s] billion of author authorization and they
[8699.12s] will use that but um the time to buy for
[8702.72s] the for the company because they&#39;re
[8704.64s] stewards of my capital as an owner
[8708.04s] um was to be buying when when we were
[8710.56s] buying and uh and and you know I I don&#39;t
[8714.24s] think we&#39;re going to get material dips
[8717.04s] from here
[8718.8s] for them to buy in a huge part of the
[8720.399s] company. I think from here it&#39;s just
[8721.76s] going to be it&#39;s just going to keep
[8723.12s] pushing higher is my general view at
[8725.12s] this point. Like the pain is in the rear
[8727.52s] the majority of the pain is in the
[8728.8s] rearview mirror. I know because I lived
[8730.319s] it buying on every red day.
[8732.6s] Um, and now it&#39;s like it&#39;s like that
[8735.92s] Microsoft chart where it&#39;s just like
[8737.92s] fundamentals are getting better, but all
[8739.52s] of a sudden people start to get
[8741.12s] interested in the stock and all that
[8742.56s] pen. It&#39;s like holding a beach ball
[8743.92s] underwater like Gener. How is the cash
[8746.479s] flow getting so much better and the
[8747.68s] revenue is starting to improve and the
[8749.12s] margin starting to expand and the price
[8750.96s] is still the same as when they had
[8752.319s] negative cash flow. It&#39;s just you&#39;re
[8754.319s] holding the beach ball under water and
[8755.68s] once you let go, it just goes when it
[8758.08s] comes it comes all at once. That&#39;s the
[8760.319s] way these turnarounds
[8762.439s] work. Yes,
[8769.84s] I met Kathy. Kathy has a house next to
[8772.319s] our in the town over from our houses in
[8774.6s] Connecticut.
[8777.16s] Um, I met her in Tampa. She&#39;s a super
[8779.84s] sweet woman, like really approachable,
[8782.72s] nice person. Uh, it&#39;s a different game.
[8786.08s] I mean, that&#39;s not my lane. So I for me
[8788.399s] to comment, you know, she&#39;s trying to
[8791.28s] guess what technologies are going to
[8792.96s] change the world and she might be right
[8794.56s] and she might pick one and that&#39;s a
[8796.08s] thousand bagger and then it will go up.
[8798.399s] I can&#39;t predict her ability to predict.
[8801.52s] I can&#39;t even predict. That&#39;s why I don&#39;t
[8803.6s] predict. I I buy these boring
[8804.96s] businesses. I can sleep well at night
[8806.56s] that are quick doubles and triples. So
[8808.64s] uh I&#39;m the wrong person to ask. But um I
[8811.76s] hope so. I hope she does great. But uh
[8813.84s] it&#39;s not not for Ray. Not not what I do.
[8816.0s] Not not for me. Yeah. What are your
[8818.319s] thoughts on car manufacturers? General
[8821.12s] Motors and others are trading wealth.
[8824.64s] Yeah, great question. I like to buy the
[8826.8s] arms dealers, not the waring faction. So
[8829.04s] GM and Ford are going to be a race to
[8830.96s] the bottom in margins. They&#39;re going to
[8832.24s] start incentives are going to start
[8833.68s] going up. Volumes are going to start
[8835.52s] going up. Race to the bottom. You want
[8837.359s] to uh play in the companies that benefit
[8840.72s] from increased volumes and let them deal
[8843.04s] with the margin compression. Same with
[8844.24s] the home builders in my opinion. So, uh,
[8846.8s] that&#39;s how we play it. I think your
[8849.359s] thinking framework is correct. I just
[8850.96s] think there are better ways to play that
[8854.04s] theme. Yeah. All right. Cool. Yeah.
[8869.439s] Yeah. Um, of
[8871.64s] those, if you put a gun to my head, I&#39;d
[8874.359s] own 10 cent for sure. And, uh, if you
[8879.52s] said you got to own a
[8881.16s] third, I&#39;d say Muan, but no one has a
[8885.2s] gun to my head, so I&#39;m just happy owning
[8887.24s] Alibaba. So,
[8889.84s] uh, but yeah, I&#39;ve looked at all of
[8891.04s] them. Yeah.
[8896.319s] Yes.
[8899.92s] No,
[8900.76s] because Brad is one of the few people
[8903.6s] who can operate a rollup properly. So
[8905.68s] what he does is he come in comes in into
[8908.479s] a fragmented business, rolls them up,
[8911.12s] applies technology. He&#39;s really good at
[8913.2s] applying technology to get cost
[8914.64s] synergies. He&#39;s not just like a private
[8916.08s] equity where he just cuts jobs and hopes
[8918.08s] that the business keeps running with
[8919.359s] half the people. um he actually brings
[8921.76s] value ad operational and synergistic
[8923.92s] stuff and then scale buying and he&#39;s
[8926.24s] just done it so many times that he&#39;s one
[8928.96s] of the few people I would bet on on a
[8930.96s] rollup because he did it at United
[8932.88s] Rentals, he did it at Waste Connections,
[8934.64s] he did it at XBO and he&#39;s just a master
[8937.6s] of doing this. So um yeah, reasonable
[8940.479s] concern but wrong guy.
[8943.52s] Yeah. company.
[8946.479s] Which guy? Who was
[8950.399s] Oh, Brad Jacobs has started QXO. It&#39;s a
[8953.439s] roll up of building supplies to play the
[8955.28s] housing recovery.
[8957.479s] Yeah. Cool. All right. Well, thanks for
[8959.84s] staying a few minutes late. I appreciate
[8961.72s] it. And uh hope you enjoy.
[8967.439s] And we&#39;re back. Warren Buffett quote of
[8970.8s] the week. In the world of business, the
[8972.64s] people who are the most successful are
[8974.0s] those who are doing what they love. Uh,
[8977.2s] no question about it, ladies and
[8978.56s] gentlemen. I feel like I&#39;m on a treasure
[8980.0s] hunt every day. Uh, again, Buffett, you
[8982.399s] don&#39;t need to be a rocket scientist.
[8984.0s] Investing is not a game where the guy
[8986.0s] with the 160 IQ beats the guy with the
[8988.72s] 130 IQ. In fact, it&#39;s often the opposite
[8991.6s] because the guy with the 160 IQ tends to
[8993.92s] be more emotional and uh affected by the
[8997.92s] day-to-day and trying to analyze every
[8999.76s] headlines rather than just being
[9001.04s] patient. Like the old study they did in
[9003.439s] Fidelity, they couldn&#39;t figure out why
[9005.439s] this one group of retail accounts
[9007.92s] outperformed every single one of their
[9009.68s] managers. And what they found after
[9011.76s] millions in research and time and effort
[9014.399s] to figure out what was the secret sauce,
[9016.319s] what they figured out was all the
[9018.0s] outperforming accounts had an owner that
[9020.8s] was dead for more than 10 years and the
[9022.96s] family didn&#39;t know the account existed.
[9024.64s] So no one sold anything. No one traded
[9026.72s] anything. It just went up over time,
[9028.64s] which is what markets do. And then
[9030.56s] finally, John Templeton, to buy when
[9033.2s] others are despondently selling and to
[9034.88s] sell when others are euphorically buying
[9036.8s] takes the greatest courage but provides
[9039.12s] the greatest profit. That&#39;s what we try
[9040.8s] to do here every single week and very
[9043.6s] grateful for all of you who um uh took
[9047.92s] this to heart last month and took
[9050.56s] advantage of the opportunities in April.
[9053.28s] You&#39;ve been amply rewarded or just sat
[9055.76s] tight when a lot of people didn&#39;t and a
[9057.52s] lot of people sold in the hole. That
[9059.04s] took a lot of courage and you are being
[9061.04s] rewarded. So kudos to you. Let&#39;s get
[9065.84s] down to data. Stocks may recover quickly
[9068.319s] from the tariff shock. Uh and the
[9071.439s] analogy they&#39;re drawing is that uh this
[9074.8s] is sharp like the COVID. The amount of
[9076.56s] days uh negative 21% over 33 days for
[9080.479s] the tariff scare. We had that uh
[9083.12s] negative 28% in
[9086.2s] 2022. COVID was negative 35% in 23. And
[9090.479s] the quicker you go down like that, the
[9092.24s] higher the faster it tends to recover.
[9094.88s] Record shorting by other. So you&#39;re
[9097.92s] still got a lot of people caught in the
[9100.0s] hole. Like during COVID, which which
[9102.8s] forces them as buyers on every positive
[9105.6s] headline and according to Bessant,
[9107.359s] there&#39;s going to be many deals
[9108.56s] announced. Very hard to get bearish into
[9110.8s] that. Prime Book, US single stocks,
[9112.96s] positive value equals a ton of record
[9115.04s] short covering here, ladies and
[9116.479s] gentlemen. Just like you saw at the end
[9118.399s] of 2022, early 2023, time to be a buyer,
[9121.439s] not a seller. The shorts are the first
[9122.88s] buyers. Then the natural buyers come in,
[9124.88s] then the forced buyers come in. Uh, and
[9126.96s] we&#39;re we&#39;re kind of got got a lot of
[9129.04s] ammo in the tank. S&amp;P 500 sectors
[9132.08s] announced buybacks. We talked about
[9133.52s] record announcements, 665 billion last
[9137.64s] week, year to date.
[9140.52s] Um, infoch, financials, communication
[9144.319s] services, consumer discretionary. You
[9146.16s] can&#39;t give away consumer discretionary.
[9147.6s] They&#39;re announcing a lot of buybacks and
[9149.2s] doing a lot of buybacks. More clues that
[9151.28s] the lows are in for
[9152.76s] 2025. We covered this on a different
[9154.96s] chart. Ryan Dietrich also put it out.
[9157.52s] Uh, performance after 55% of components
[9159.92s] make a 20-day high 1970 to current shows
[9163.28s] very positive returns. Option sentiment
[9165.76s] remains bearish on the dollar. As I
[9168.319s] said, now that everyone&#39;s getting
[9169.6s] bearish, we probably get a counter trend
[9171.2s] bounce before we resume the secular
[9173.12s] trend lower. US earnings revision
[9175.76s] momentum turns positive. Gage showed
[9177.84s] renewed optim optimism after 6 months of
[9180.88s] negative readings. Okay, so that&#39;s a
[9183.68s] positive thing to start to see. Uh
[9186.0s] midcap forward earnings relative to
[9188.0s] small
[9189.24s] cap going up. Bulls are built on the
[9193.2s] shoulders of bears. You can see these
[9195.04s] big bull markets and the kind of uh
[9197.359s] short-term draw down. So which we just
[9199.2s] had a bare market draw a 20% draw down
[9202.16s] and now we are in bull market as the
[9205.12s] markets recovered. Uh NASDAQ over 20%
[9208.319s] and the other indices following suit
[9210.08s] some of the European indices at all-time
[9211.84s] highs. World percentage of equity
[9213.92s] indices above 50-day moving average.
[9215.92s] This is what you see coming out of a
[9217.28s] trough in fall of 2023. That&#39;s a good
[9220.479s] thing. That first abrupt move upward. uh
[9223.359s] non- US markets while cheap relative to
[9225.2s] the US are not particularly inexpensive
[9227.359s] relative to their own history. China
[9230.479s] again being the lowest emerging markets,
[9233.439s] United Kingdom, that&#39;s where there&#39;s
[9234.88s] some serious opportunity there. Another
[9237.12s] rare and bullish signal. Uh S&amp;P perfor
[9240.8s] performance after 60% of components make
[9243.439s] a 20-day new high. 12 months out, up 9%
[9246.479s] on average, 10.4% medium. Uh, when
[9249.359s] Degraph and Zwag breath thrusts occur.
[9253.12s] When Degraph and Zwag breath thrusts
[9256.319s] occur within one month of each other. I
[9258.8s] think I&#39;m still on three different t
[9260.399s] time zones, ladies and gentlemen. But
[9262.0s] I&#39;m having caffeine and Pasha is doing a
[9264.319s] good job getting coffees for everyone.
[9267.399s] So here&#39;s what happened. Six Six months
[9270.16s] later, you&#39;re up 16% on average. One
[9272.88s] year later, up 26%. So, a lot of
[9276.16s] positive things to be looking forward
[9278.479s] to. Money market mutual funds held by
[9280.399s] retail and institutions. Lot of dry
[9282.96s] powder here. Record dry powder impacted
[9285.28s] Buffett&#39;s gifts. Buffett&#39;s fortune would
[9287.359s] have topped Musk&#39;s if he hadn&#39;t donated
[9289.52s] shares to charity. He&#39;d be $87 billion
[9292.16s] wealthier than Elon Musk if he hadn&#39;t
[9294.0s] given away so much. He&#39;d be worth $400
[9296.92s] billion. This is the goat, ladies and
[9299.6s] gentlemen. Never doubt it. Never think
[9301.359s] it will be replicated. Buffett was and
[9303.84s] is the greatest of all time. Hedge funds
[9307.12s] still look to short stocks which it is
[9309.84s] further buying power for upside on every
[9312.08s] positive
[9313.0s] headline. Won&#39;t be straight up will be
[9315.2s] fits and starts. Uh upside is the
[9317.68s] direction. Like I said months ago,
[9320.88s] welcome to Trump 2.0. Same as Trump 1.0.
[9324.24s] Uh new volatility, new, you know, new
[9326.96s] tweet, new volatility resolves to the
[9329.359s] upside over time. The share of those who
[9331.84s] carry credit card balances is below 2019
[9335.04s] levels for all income groups. The c
[9337.439s] customer balance sheet is still good.
[9340.0s] Flows into Europe are picking up.
[9342.24s] Opinion follows trend. Loan growth in
[9345.2s] China expected to soon pick up. As a
[9347.12s] matter of fact, global M2 money supply,
[9350.08s] pull it up on Google, is reacelerating.
[9353.2s] And a lot of that is attributable to
[9354.96s] China&#39;s massive stimulus that&#39;s in the
[9357.92s] pipeline and happening as we speak. And
[9360.479s] we&#39;re seeing it in the
[9362.92s] numbers. This is S&amp;P 500. Healthcare
[9367.04s] relative performance is off the charts
[9369.359s] low. There&#39;s opportunities to be had
[9371.12s] there. We expressed through biotech
[9373.92s] basket and uh Baxter for now, but we
[9377.04s] continue to look for opportunity.
[9381.88s] Teima. So, you can see a lot of the
[9387.8s] um a lot of the obesity stocks got hit.
[9390.64s] You remember when Lily was so hot and I
[9392.56s] said, &quot;Ladies and gentlemen, there
[9394.96s] there&#39;s there&#39;s competitions coming.&quot;
[9396.88s] Just like I said with Nvidia,
[9398.24s] competition&#39;s coming. Um when they get
[9400.72s] that extreme and that certain Nova
[9402.72s] Nordis and everything else, they&#39;ve just
[9404.399s] been slaughtered. Post election years
[9406.8s] tend to bottom in early April and rally.
[9409.28s] So here we are in the seasonality that
[9411.439s] bodess well all the way into late
[9413.52s] summer. So let&#39;s keep the heat on and
[9415.52s] stay focused. Um then value benefit is
[9418.88s] so you can see where we are relative to
[9420.56s] where we should be and it looks like
[9422.24s] some more strength maybe a little
[9423.439s] weakness in mid July. Value benefit from
[9426.16s] broading broadening Q1 broadening has
[9429.2s] averaged 42% since February 19th. So
[9432.16s] that&#39;s a sign of stocks beating the S&amp;P.
[9435.6s] That&#39;s broadening. That&#39;s healthy.
[9436.96s] That&#39;s good for stock pickers like us.
[9439.439s] Uh, United States retail sales
[9441.96s] year-over-year they soft data they keep
[9444.56s] saying that uh the world is ending the
[9447.12s] hard data they keep spending like
[9448.479s] there&#39;s no tomorrow. United Healthcare
[9450.56s] Group biggest draw down since 2009. A
[9452.64s] lot of people keep asking. I think
[9454.24s] there&#39;s no way to have certainty that
[9455.92s] there wasn&#39;t some level of fraud. The
[9457.52s] question is how much. I think we&#39;re
[9459.12s] close to the levels where you got you
[9460.64s] could take a coin flip gamble. We&#39;re not
[9462.88s] going to do that. But if it gets to 200
[9466.319s] or below and stays there for a little
[9467.92s] while, we might be interested. I think
[9469.6s] enough people and institutions got
[9471.439s] slaughtered in this that it&#39;s going to
[9472.72s] take a while to rebuild a base. So,
[9474.319s] we&#39;re in no rush and we want more
[9476.319s] information and we&#39;re willing to miss
[9477.96s] it. Healthc care sector relative to S&amp;P
[9481.2s] 500, the cheapest since 2001. There&#39;s
[9484.64s] opportunity. There&#39;s a pony in this pile
[9486.64s] as they say. High yield credit spreads
[9488.88s] coming in. Sign of no recession. There
[9491.359s] was fear in April 7th. That fear has
[9494.0s] subsided. Overall, Prime Book gross
[9495.92s] versus net leverage still a lot of room
[9498.479s] to run for risk on and chasing
[9501.52s] electricity consumption going through
[9503.6s] the roof. Comtock resources, how you
[9505.92s] doing? Alibaba cloud year-on-year
[9508.319s] revenue growth up 18% year-on-year. Look
[9511.439s] at the acceleration not just in the
[9513.84s] absolute revenue but in the pace at
[9516.479s] which the revenue is growing fueled by
[9520.16s] uh being number one in cloud services
[9522.24s] fueled by AI products and just be
[9525.64s] beginning. Mike Zucardi Bank of America
[9528.399s] over 70% of survey respondents plan on
[9530.56s] vacationing this summer. A higher
[9531.76s] percentage than last year&#39;s survey. Um
[9534.479s] good thing to do if you believe the
[9536.0s] world is coming to an end. uh but uh
[9538.88s] your actions do not reflect it and we
[9540.96s] focus on actions not words. Four-year
[9543.68s] cycle for 2025 we&#39;re following right
[9546.16s] along TAC which again points to strength
[9548.96s] all the way into
[9551.2s] uh early August with a little bit of
[9553.12s] bumpiness in June. Uh this has been our
[9556.319s] framework since the beginning of the
[9558.08s] year. We didn&#39;t expect the magnitude of
[9560.0s] the draw down. We were looking for
[9561.76s] buckle up buttercup February March 8 to
[9564.479s] 10% pullback. We got Liberation Day and
[9567.52s] we used it to our advantage. You got to
[9570.0s] play the cards you&#39;re dealt, not the
[9571.76s] cards you want and we played that uh uh
[9575.359s] like like an absolute World Series of
[9577.6s] Poker Champion in April and uh we&#39;re
[9580.24s] excited and uh you played right along
[9582.56s] with us and uh that&#39;s that&#39;s just
[9585.6s] absolutely amazing. Breath of Earnings
[9587.2s] suggests Bed should be in a cutting
[9588.56s] phase. We agree too late. Powell is a
[9590.8s] real thing. He&#39;s 150 basis points too
[9595.8s] restrictive percent of S&amp;P 500 members
[9599.04s] above the 50-day moving average now at
[9601.319s] 75% abrupt short covering. Now we get
[9604.72s] into the chase phase. Magnificent 7
[9607.12s] mirroring Nifty50
[9609.08s] performance. Uh I don&#39;t love these
[9611.2s] analogs but it&#39;s worth
[9613.0s] noting pockets of it for sure. XLV after
[9616.399s] 52- week low and positive close a year
[9619.12s] out. That&#39;s the health care sector up on
[9621.84s] average
[9623.0s] 21%. Got to be focused on health care
[9625.68s] right now. Concentration of S&amp;P 500
[9628.479s] market cap and earnings in the 10
[9630.479s] largest index constituents. The market
[9633.439s] cap uh is 37% share of the S&amp;P 500 while
[9638.8s] the earnings are only 30%. These numbers
[9642.0s] have a tendency to converge. Which is
[9643.92s] why we said uh before the draw down of
[9647.52s] mag 7 that mag 7 was going to correct.
[9650.319s] That was go back to all of our podcasts
[9652.24s] in uh the last quarter of last year.
[9655.359s] They certainly did and everyone said it
[9657.6s] was tariffs but most of them are
[9658.96s] unaffected by tariffs. So what actually
[9660.64s] wasn&#39;t? it was the fact that their
[9662.399s] earnings growth decelerated from 33% to
[9666.6s] 15% ballpark and um and their multiple
[9670.319s] still hasn&#39;t come down commensurate with
[9672.479s] that reduction in earnings power.
[9674.56s] Therefore, we do think that while they
[9676.8s] will bounce and maybe trade as a group
[9678.88s] back to the top of the range, the real
[9681.04s] opportunity is going to be in the 493 uh
[9683.76s] and these will continue to underperform
[9685.76s] relative to the indices. That doesn&#39;t
[9687.2s] mean crash. That doesn&#39;t mean tech wreck
[9689.6s] of 2000 or 2022. It means underperform
[9692.88s] relative to the unmagnificent 493 as a
[9695.439s] basket. Gap between mag 7 and 493
[9697.84s] earnings growth is expected to narrow.
[9699.6s] 36% earnings growth last year, 15% this
[9702.24s] year. Unmnificent 4% last year, moving
[9705.04s] up to 13%. The euro&#39;s had its best
[9708.08s] year-to- date gain since
[9710.6s] 2020. Dollar weakening, euro gaining.
[9713.2s] People are starting to get excited,
[9714.8s] which means
[9716.52s] um we&#39;ll have a short-term pause. Retail
[9719.359s] market share reached 36% in late April
[9721.84s] on low market
[9723.96s] volume. Tariff estimates keep sliding.
[9726.96s] Went all the way up to 28% now down to
[9729.6s] 14%. Probably nets out around 10% give
[9732.64s] or take. Plus the non-tariff barriers is
[9734.8s] going to be the whole name of the game
[9736.16s] particularly as it relates to China
[9738.16s] opening their market. biggest six weeks
[9740.399s] VIX percent declines and forward S&amp;P
[9742.72s] total returns. So on average uh you&#39;re
[9746.08s] looking at five years out 92% return
[9749.2s] average one year out 20.8
[9752.8s] uh and uh we are in that neighborhood.
[9756.24s] What did we have
[9758.6s] here? Uh
[9761.399s] goodness. Wow. The biggest VIX crush. So
[9765.92s] if you look at some of these others,
[9767.52s] they were up 46% a year out. But anyway,
[9771.04s] the point is the mean a year out is 20%.
[9773.6s] When you get the VIX collapse off such
[9775.2s] high levels, S&amp;P 500 one-year forward
[9777.92s] returns after the last 58% of the S&amp;P
[9780.479s] 500 stocks hit a four new four-week
[9782.72s] high. You can see on average
[9785.56s] 16.1%. Lot of positivity, almost 100%
[9788.479s] positivity ratio, if not 100% exactly.
[9792.0s] smaller share of homes built in 2010s
[9794.16s] than
[9795.08s] any decade since 1940s. You know what
[9798.72s] happened next? The game was on. We&#39;re
[9800.399s] going to talk, we talked about in that
[9802.399s] presentation uh at the money show the
[9805.359s] reasons why that&#39;s going to be taking
[9806.8s] place. US versus foreign stock fund
[9808.84s] performance. Foreign large blend is up
[9811.16s] 12.6% year-to date. US large blend is up
[9814.399s] 6 12%
[9816.76s] outperformance of international versus
[9819.6s] US. That&#39;s going to continue. The last
[9821.76s] time you had that divergence, you had
[9823.2s] seven years of international
[9825.319s] outperformance. Prime Book US Energy uh
[9828.8s] weekly net flows that people are
[9830.8s] starting to uh nibble around energy
[9833.439s] stocks. Magnificent 7 PE premium versus
[9836.72s] the 493 has come back to
[9840.6s] uh 43% premium, but the earnings growth
[9844.56s] again still probably doesn&#39;t justify it.
[9847.12s] That&#39;s why I think it trades back up to
[9848.64s] the highs, but it probably as a basket
[9851.52s] uh stalls
[9855.24s] out. What if you panic sold and missed
[9858.0s] April
[9859.88s] 9th?
[9864.68s] Uh you&#39;re still down
[9868.439s] 9% versus
[9870.84s] flat. Uh or if you listen to this
[9873.279s] podcast, you&#39;re up a ton. Okay, that&#39;s
[9876.08s] the bottom line. Uh, and if you were on
[9878.479s] that client call that we did, you&#39;re up
[9880.0s] a lot more than a ton. Uh, housing
[9882.08s] inventory active listing count in
[9884.439s] Florida. So, Florida tends to be a
[9887.279s] leading indicator and you&#39;re seeing a
[9888.88s] lot of supply in Florida and you&#39;re
[9890.479s] seeing price declines in a lot of
[9892.479s] pockets of Florida. So, we&#39;re keeping a
[9894.16s] close eye on that. That should could
[9895.52s] help. Affordability. Consumers don&#39;t
[9897.6s] believe break evens or
[9899.72s] CPI. University of
[9902.359s] Michigan. Uh, a lot of these data have
[9905.2s] been coming in by political party. The
[9907.12s] Republicans think there&#39;s no inflation,
[9909.279s] the Democrats think it&#39;s 6%. So, the
[9911.84s] truth is actually probably right in the
[9913.52s] middle like everything else. Uh, Hong
[9916.399s] Kong equities surged for a fourth
[9917.92s] consecutive month in April, reaching 166
[9920.8s] billion Hong Kong dollars, well above
[9922.24s] historical average. While momentum
[9923.6s] remains strong, easing US China tensions
[9925.84s] and yuan stabilization. May temper May
[9928.319s] inflow signaling a potential pause in
[9929.92s] the capital shift toward Hong Kong. So,
[9931.52s] we saw a little bit of that. I think
[9932.88s] that&#39;s goes right back on based on they
[9936.319s] uh lowered rates again for the first
[9939.04s] time in 7 months. The Chinese, they&#39;re
[9940.8s] going to keep the pedal to the metal.
[9943.52s] Sector fund inflows going back into
[9945.359s] technology in the short
[9947.0s] term. Financials again, I think top of
[9950.24s] the range is where that targets. Equity
[9952.16s] positioning across sectors. Utilities is
[9954.8s] overweight. Materials is underweight. We
[9956.64s] like Albamaro there. Demographics are a
[9959.2s] tailwind to housing demand. We can&#39;t
[9960.96s] overemphasize that. Go to hedge
[9962.92s] fundtips.com get the slide deck. When
[9965.12s] you go to the article of the week, which
[9968.96s] is Baba back in business, you will see
[9970.96s] the slide deck
[9972.68s] there. No, this is not another rally.
[9975.359s] S&amp;P performance after 19% in 27 trading
[9978.56s] days has average another 9.2% up in the
[9983.279s] next 12 months. Atlanta GDP now is for
[9987.279s] the this quarter. Q2 is 2.3 or 2.5% give
[9993.359s] or take which means no recession. We got
[9995.84s] negative GDP although it was inventory
[9998.64s] affected pull forward uh in Q1. You
[10001.279s] still don&#39;t want two consecutive
[10002.8s] quarters of negative GDP growth. Look at
[10005.2s] all the Dubai buildings in the
[10006.479s] background. Pretty cool. And then NASDAQ
[10009.359s] compositive change in the three years
[10011.04s] after Netscape release versus CH GPT
[10013.439s] release. So you had a shakeout. This
[10015.439s] implies that we got more to go. They&#39;re
[10018.0s] doing an analog bespoke Paul Hickeyy&#39;s
[10021.76s] uh kind of trying to show that there&#39;s a
[10024.64s] lot more upside. We agree NASDAQ
[10026.96s] composite change in the 5 years after
[10028.72s] Netscape released versus chat GPT
[10030.8s] release. These analoges are worth noting
[10033.2s] but not worth betting the ranch on. But
[10036.24s] I do think there&#39;s a lot of runway.
[10037.92s] Roaring 2000s is nent. We&#39;re halfway
[10040.399s] through. US households buy highest price
[10044.16s] home they can afford.
[10046.8s] um house
[10048.76s] price. Yeah, and that&#39;s the problem. The
[10051.2s] median house is in the 400s and most
[10054.24s] people can&#39;t afford it. Funding spreads,
[10056.319s] professional investor positioning,
[10058.0s] average funding spread, S&amp;P level. So,
[10061.47s] [Music]
[10063.16s] um this will chase
[10067.56s] up GS social media economic sentiment
[10070.72s] index university. So, Goldman Sachs
[10074.319s] sentiment is high. The University of
[10076.319s] Michigan is very low. These are
[10078.24s] divergences. This is start looking a lot
[10080.0s] like hard data versus soft data. We
[10082.64s] think that the soft data will catch up
[10084.16s] to the hard data as opinion follows
[10085.84s] trend. Net retail net imbalance before
[10088.24s] 12:30 p.m. Very high. I&#39;m not sure what
[10091.359s] the use of that chart is. The median age
[10093.6s] of all home buyers is now 56 years old,
[10096.0s] up from 31 in 1981. How are they going
[10098.96s] to solve for this? Get the deck. Uh go
[10101.92s] through that presentation. And it&#39;s
[10103.439s] going to be 1,400 ft² houses like we had
[10105.68s] in the 80s as starter homes. A a a
[10108.56s] 35year-old family with, you know, a kid
[10111.6s] on the way doesn&#39;t need an indoor
[10113.2s] swimming pool in a movie theater. Earn
[10115.04s] it. You can have it in your mid-40s. US
[10117.279s] data centers are currently powered
[10118.8s] mainly by gas and coal. We love the gas
[10121.68s] play with comtock. Flows by ETF
[10123.92s] category. Cumulatively
[10127.24s] uh individual investor ETF flows have
[10131.0s] accelerated big
[10135.16s] time and that&#39;s that on the data on the
[10138.479s] headlines. Let&#39;s look at Alibaba cements
[10140.319s] AI leadership as cloud unit reports
[10142.16s] fastest growth since
[10144.04s] 2022. How you doing? Ant group global
[10147.279s] unit brings $3 billion ahead of spin-off
[10153.279s] uh international division generated
[10155.04s] nearly three billion in revenue in 2024
[10158.24s] uh and that&#39;s going to be spun. So we
[10161.12s] own 35% of the whole entity as owners of
[10163.52s] Alibaba. One more thing that&#39;s not
[10165.76s] priced into the stock. Big Chinese
[10167.52s] companies like Alibaba show that AI
[10169.359s] powered ads are giving shopping a boost.
[10172.399s] uh this is early days and they are the
[10174.399s] leader globally not just in China in our
[10176.8s] view capital flows back into US listed
[10178.96s] China
[10180.92s] ETFs post big selloff
[10187.6s] uh that was
[10189.08s] a daily
[10191.68s] ugly
[10193.56s] flows okay uh despite US rebound
[10197.279s] international stock funds continue to
[10199.479s] lead big tech goes from Stock market
[10202.399s] safest bet to biggest
[10204.68s] question. After more than a decade of
[10207.12s] little change, US electricity
[10208.64s] consumption is rising again. That helps
[10211.04s] Generrack. That helps comtock. AI boom
[10213.6s] has Generrack looking to data centers
[10216.0s] for growth. They&#39;re now going to be in
[10218.319s] that business, which is a monster. And
[10220.56s] uh uh you can buy it at a reasonable
[10222.8s] price still. Millions of Americans at
[10225.2s] risk of summer power shortfall. That
[10228.0s] helps gener a trade made for Buffett.
[10230.24s] energy stocks priced below book value.
[10234.2s] Uh I think you got to go down the
[10236.8s] quality spectrum to take advantage. The
[10239.04s] higher quality names just haven&#39;t come
[10240.56s] in enough for us to get excited. US
[10242.8s] housing starts ticked up in April. We&#39;re
[10245.04s] going to see more and more of that as
[10246.96s] the initiatives of the administration
[10249.6s] kick in. Uh which is in the slide deck
[10252.8s] we referenced in the article of the week
[10255.12s] from the money show. Boeing Inc.&#39;s
[10256.8s] record-breaking deal for Qatar Airways
[10259.439s] to buy Cutter Airways to buy up to
[10262.76s] 210 planes. Trump brought home the bacon
[10266.479s] trillion dollars of deals from the
[10267.92s] Middle East. Uh and Buffett Boeing is a
[10272.319s] beneficiary. That&#39;s one of our largest
[10273.96s] positions. You remember me on Vney four
[10277.52s] weeks ago pounding the table at 129 and
[10280.64s] 135. Now it&#39;s 205 210 and still no one&#39;s
[10285.68s] paying attention to it which means it&#39;s
[10287.279s] going higher. Dagio plans cost cuts
[10289.92s] asset sales to reduce debt normal
[10292.319s] turnaround actions. We like to see
[10294.16s] action. Hedge fun in indices dollar
[10297.12s] route as biggest players I exit. Uh the
[10300.56s] point here is that
[10305.0s] uh okay quote we have a lot of real
[10307.76s] money clients that are saying quote we
[10310.479s] really haven&#39;t done much yet. Norberg
[10312.8s] who first turned bearish on the dollar
[10314.319s] in early March said in an interview uh
[10316.96s] all these long-term players are looking
[10318.72s] for an opportunity to actually reduce
[10320.479s] their dollar exposure. Short-term
[10322.96s] counter trend bounce intermediate term
[10325.439s] secular decline. Dollar will go weaker.
[10327.52s] that helps international uh that helps a
[10330.08s] lot of things that we&#39;re positioned for
[10331.92s] expected to continue most overvalued
[10334.24s] since the Plaza Accords 1987
[10337.439s] uh Reagan&#39;s second term. Uh whether we
[10340.8s] get a formal revalue as a trade
[10344.88s] negotiation or an implicit revalue that
[10349.04s] has the same net effect is immaterial.
[10351.12s] The key is the dollars going down into
[10353.279s] order to balance trade. value investing
[10356.88s] is poised to rise from the dead. That&#39;s
[10359.439s] from Reuters. Um, and you can go back
[10363.2s] through the cycles in the
[10365.96s] deck. Um, just like value and growth is
[10369.96s] now perfectly positioned for value to
[10372.479s] outperform. Same with international
[10374.16s] versus US. And, uh, the data supports
[10377.439s] it. Why small cap stocks are ready for a
[10379.84s] rebound? Same thing. international small
[10382.76s] cap value you position there you&#39;re
[10386.08s] going to outperform over the next
[10387.359s] handful of years in our view US credit
[10390.0s] gets downgraded by Moody&#39;s uh biggest
[10392.64s] snore story of the year last AAA rating
[10396.16s] moving along US set to cut capital
[10398.399s] requirements for banks this is the big
[10400.64s] deal that we&#39;ve been talking about the
[10402.16s] SLR when this happens you&#39;re going to
[10404.56s] see the 10-year yield come down because
[10407.12s] the demand for
[10409.72s] uh T bills will be unlimited. Every bank
[10413.279s] wants to earn at 4% with no curve risk
[10416.72s] and uh the cost of capital is much
[10419.2s] lower. Make a free spread of 200 300
[10422.16s] basis points with zero risk. There will
[10424.399s] be unlimited buyers of the short end of
[10426.08s] the curve. The Treasury can then use
[10428.0s] that to buy in the long end of the curve
[10431.2s] and do an operation twist like we saw in
[10433.52s] 2012, which brings the 10-year yield
[10436.0s] down 30 to 75 basis points, which sets
[10438.88s] off sets uh 30-year mortgages, like I&#39;ve
[10441.76s] been saying since the beginning of the
[10443.439s] year, the biggest surprise of this year
[10445.2s] will be 30-year fixed rate mortgages
[10447.439s] below 6%. And when that happens,
[10450.08s] housing&#39;s going to boom. And when
[10451.52s] housing booms, what&#39;s going to boom?
[10453.2s] Stanley Black &amp; Decker, Generrack, and
[10456.439s] QXO. Ladies and gentlemen, off to the
[10459.24s] races. Uh, Goldman unveils
[10464.52s] new I don&#39;t know what that is. All
[10466.56s] right. Less generous Warren Buffett
[10468.72s] would be 67 billion richer than Elon
[10471.76s] Musk. The GOAT. Perplexity partners with
[10474.319s] PayPal for an in chat shopping as AI
[10477.12s] race heats up. Love PayPal. Uh, we
[10480.72s] talked about it a few weeks ago. Go back
[10482.319s] to that article. Intel
[10484.279s] debuts AI GPUs for workstation system as
[10488.0s] it works to gain ground on Nvidia and
[10494.6s] AMD. Moving
[10498.04s] along article of the week, Baba back in
[10500.72s] business stock market and sentiment
[10503.2s] results. So we went through the media.
[10505.84s] Now on to the Bank of America fund
[10508.88s] manager survey. Five key points. US
[10511.76s] equity allocation is at the lowest since
[10513.52s] May 2023 with a net 38% underweight. So
[10518.479s] maybe a little short-term bounce but
[10520.319s] back to intermediate term the trend will
[10522.64s] continue international over US. Number
[10526.24s] two managers are the most underweight
[10528.0s] the US dollar since May 2020 May 2006
[10531.52s] with 17% of investors holding a net
[10534.0s] underweight position. Counter trend
[10536.72s] bounce, get the Johnny come lately,
[10538.64s] resume the downtrend like you saw in the
[10541.92s] first part of the century from 2000 to
[10545.72s] 2007. Global
[10547.72s] energy, nobody wants to touch energy
[10550.08s] with managers at a record low net 35%
[10553.2s] underweight to the sector. Expectations
[10555.439s] for a soft landing rebounded 61% up from
[10558.72s] just 37% in last month&#39;s survey. and
[10562.8s] five recession expectations appear to
[10565.12s] have peaked even before the US China
[10567.84s] tariff agreement was announced only 1%
[10570.08s] of May FMS investors now see a global
[10575.279s] recession likely down from 42% in April
[10579.04s] Alibaba update uh what you can see here
[10582.72s] they said they were going to invest in
[10584.08s] cash flow but look what&#39;s happening with
[10585.68s] revenues uh revenues keep going up
[10588.16s] margins are going back up return on
[10589.92s] invested capital is going up cash flow
[10592.16s] down because they&#39;re investing to be
[10593.68s] number to stay number one and to win the
[10596.56s] AI race which is the cheapest global AI
[10599.439s] play with the most possible upside. You
[10602.16s] want them to invest when they&#39;re just
[10604.08s] buying back stock. They&#39;re saying we
[10606.08s] cannot get a return on invested capital
[10609.04s] greater than 10%. When they start
[10611.76s] investing in the business they&#39;re
[10612.96s] telling you we
[10614.92s] can out earn doing buybacks because the
[10618.64s] opportunity set is grand. And that&#39;s
[10621.68s] exactly what we&#39;re seeing. Still at a
[10623.76s] tremendously low multiple doubledigit
[10627.359s] earnings growth just the beginning of
[10629.84s] the uh middle class recovery. Taell and
[10633.439s] T-Mol shot the lights out. Let&#39;s go sec
[10637.68s] uh couple key
[10640.04s] things. Uh the headlines were that they
[10642.64s] missed it was like dimminimous
[10647.88s] uh amount short-term voting machine
[10650.64s] long-term weighing machine. The core of
[10652.64s] our thesis is one a proxy for Chinese AI
[10655.04s] and two the toll taker for the middle
[10656.399s] class recovery pivot toward consumption
[10658.479s] $20 trillion of savings. The Chinese
[10660.479s] government has said we&#39;re going to force
[10662.0s] those savings into consumption like the
[10664.56s] rest of the world by 2030. We want our
[10666.72s] consumption at 70%. They&#39;re taking the
[10669.12s] stimulative actions to do so. Cloud
[10671.439s] segment saw the fastest growth since
[10673.24s] 2022, up 18% year-over-year. Tao team
[10677.12s] all was up 9% year-over-year revenue to
[10680.84s] 13.97 billion driven by consu customer
[10684.479s] management revenues up 12%
[10686.6s] year-over-year. Most importantly, both
[10688.56s] segments are expected to continue
[10689.92s] accelerating fiscal 2026. And as
[10693.12s] long-term shareholders, this is exactly
[10695.04s] what we want to see. Part of what makes
[10697.2s] Alibaba so unique is it&#39;s essentially
[10698.96s] the only company in the world, let alone
[10700.64s] in China, that have both. Number one, a
[10702.96s] marketleading cloud position and number
[10704.8s] two, a marketleading in-house large
[10707.439s] language model, Quen 2.4. Amazon has
[10710.64s] done incredibly well with AWS, but not
[10713.279s] on the large language model. Meta has
[10715.52s] strong large language model, but doesn&#39;t
[10717.52s] offer cloud service. Microsoft has
[10719.359s] strong cloud market share with Azure,
[10721.04s] but outsources or partners with OpenAI
[10723.279s] for its LLM. And the only other company
[10726.319s] that has somewhat both is Google, but
[10728.0s] it&#39;s not a true market leader in cloud,
[10729.6s] holding a smaller number three position.
[10731.359s] Then there&#39;s Alibaba, number one leader
[10733.359s] in China with 36% of cloud share in the
[10735.76s] Quen 3 model, which is the world&#39;s
[10737.92s] largest open-source model family and a
[10740.08s] top performer globally. All developed at
[10742.0s] a fraction of competitors cost. This
[10744.16s] business model is incredibly powerful.
[10745.92s] Anyone using AI needs more cloud compute
[10747.92s] resources and anyone using cloud compute
[10749.84s] wants AI capabilities. As it turns out,
[10752.72s] this combination is also highly
[10754.72s] profitable. And this flywheel is just
[10757.52s] getting started. Cloud and AI are being
[10759.68s] incorporated into e-commerce. Uh whether
[10762.16s] it&#39;s improving research, improving
[10764.64s] search, personalized recommendations, or
[10766.56s] advertising efficiency. So when
[10768.08s] management talks about this opportunity
[10769.84s] shaping the next 10 to 20 years, this is
[10771.76s] exactly what they mean. Meanwhile, the
[10773.84s] market is focused on the short-term
[10775.279s] margin volatility. The bottom line is
[10777.04s] Baba is firing on all cylinders and the
[10779.52s] beach ball hasn&#39;t even broken the
[10781.279s] surface yet. Here&#39;s everything you need
[10783.2s] to know about Q4 earnings. So, you can
[10787.319s] um go through that. Overall revenue was
[10790.8s] up 7% year-on-year. Income from
[10793.439s] operations 93%. Uh cash, let&#39;s go
[10797.6s] through the top. You can see section
[10800.0s] sector by sector up. AIDC international
[10803.6s] commerce up 22% cloud up 18% TAL team
[10807.12s] all up 9%
[10809.92s] um and then you can see the adjusted
[10814.2s] IBIDA and go through sector by sector so
[10817.92s] everything is hitting on all cylinders
[10819.52s] the 10 key points cloud segment se
[10821.439s] segment up 18% but even more impressive
[10824.319s] ibida was up 69% to 333 million
[10827.359s] management saw a surge in enterprise
[10829.439s] customer demand across different
[10830.72s] industries and more importantly ly
[10831.92s] they&#39;re now seeing a growing number of
[10833.359s] small and medium businesses demanding
[10835.359s] cloud and AI compute management
[10837.92s] continues to expect cloud segment to
[10839.68s] accelerate through fiscal year 2026 as
[10841.76s] they move forward with $52 billion of
[10844.16s] cloud and AI investment over the next
[10846.24s] three years. Two, Tableau and T-Mol
[10848.319s] posted another strong quarter with
[10849.68s] revenues up 9% to almost 14 billion
[10852.399s] rising 8% year-over-year. 88 VIP
[10855.68s] members, essentially the equivalent of
[10857.04s] Amazon Prime, remain the highest
[10858.56s] spending consumer group and continue to
[10860.08s] grow by double digits year-over-year,
[10861.92s] now exceeding 50 million users. Uh CMR
[10864.88s] revenues increased 12% in Q4 and are
[10867.439s] expected to remain strong, driven by
[10870.439s] the60% 60 basis point software service
[10873.12s] fee and the expanding use of
[10876.68s] Quanzan, a merchant advertising tool.
[10880.399s] The medium-term goal remains stabilizing
[10882.64s] market share for TTG which currently
[10884.56s] sits around 40% i.e. 40% of all
[10888.8s] e-commerce revenues in China go through
[10891.479s] Alibaba. Management returned 16.5
[10894.16s] billion to shareholders in fiscal year
[10895.76s] 25 including 4.6 billion in dividends at
[10898.88s] $2 per ads and 11.9 billion in share
[10902.56s] buybacks which reduced the share count
[10904.399s] by 5.1%. So, what that means is your
[10908.96s] slice of the pie got 5.1% bigger without
[10912.56s] spending more money at today&#39;s price.
[10914.96s] That gives you a 1.62 dividend yield and
[10917.76s] a 5.1% buyback yield. Total shareholder
[10920.88s] yield of
[10922.279s] 6.72% before taking into account any
[10925.04s] share price appreciation, i.e. better
[10928.08s] than a quote unquote risk-free bond with
[10930.96s] no upside by 50% better. Management
[10933.76s] views instant commerce as a huge
[10935.279s] opportunity is starting to lean into it.
[10936.88s] The market is expected to grow from 500
[10938.72s] to 600 million consumers all the way to
[10940.72s] a billion over time in China. Early
[10942.8s] results have far exceeded original
[10944.24s] expectations as management integrates
[10945.92s] instant commerce through TTG driving new
[10948.16s] users as well as increased stick
[10950.08s] stickiness frequency and overall
[10951.6s] consumption. These investments will
[10952.72s] weigh on IBIDA margins in the near term
[10955.2s] but will be a long-term growth driver
[10956.72s] for IBIDA&#39;s largest segment. For Baba&#39;s
[10959.2s] largest segment, AI related product
[10960.96s] revenue reached its seventh consecutive
[10963.52s] quarter of tripledigit year-over-year
[10966.16s] growth. Quen 3 series is now the largest
[10969.359s] open-source model family and continues
[10971.439s] to deliver worldleading performance on
[10973.76s] all key benchmarks at significantly
[10976.319s] lower cost. Stock-based compensation,
[10978.16s] which Ali used Alibaba used to hand out
[10980.16s] like candy, was just 473 million this
[10983.12s] year, down 52% year-over-year.
[10985.52s] Management has finally shifted toward
[10987.279s] long-term cash incentives backed by a
[10989.52s] $50 billion net cash position. It&#39;s a
[10992.24s] move we&#39;ve long preferred. Alibaba AIDC
[10995.439s] came in slightly below expectations with
[10997.6s] revenue growth of 22% year-over-year to
[11000.56s] 4.63 billion. Most importantly,
[11002.479s] management remains on track to achieve
[11004.0s] quarterly profitability for the segment
[11006.08s] in fiscal year 2026 as they work toward
[11008.319s] profitability at scale for one of the
[11010.08s] company&#39;s largest overall segments. All
[11012.08s] other loss generating segments continue
[11014.24s] to improve with losses narrowing
[11015.6s] year-over-year. Free cash flow for the
[11017.52s] quarter was only 516 million down 76.
[11020.399s] But this was largely intentional and
[11021.84s] mainly due to increased cloud
[11023.279s] infrastructure spending. Cash provided
[11025.439s] by operating activities was nearly $4
[11028.68s] billion 3.8 billion during the quarter
[11031.279s] up 18% year-over-year which supports
[11034.479s] this explanation. Okay, that&#39;s the most
[11036.88s] important metric you need to be looking
[11038.479s] at. 10. During the quarter, management
[11041.279s] continued to monetize non-core assets
[11043.04s] with the sale of Sun Art and in time
[11045.04s] expected to generate $2.6 billion in
[11047.92s] cash proceeds. You didn&#39;t even know you
[11049.6s] owned it. Unbelievable. Oh, I found an
[11051.6s] extra $2.6 billion over here in my left
[11054.16s] pocket. Uh, and you get a piece of that
[11056.24s] action. 5.1% bigger piece than you would
[11059.12s] have gotten last year. And finally,
[11061.359s] Estee Lauder quick update. You can see
[11063.359s] the cash flows uh and stock price seem
[11066.319s] to have bottomed out. Not an accident.
[11068.16s] Price follows cash flow. They&#39;re
[11069.76s] implementing the turnaround plan with
[11072.24s] cost cuts and uh and this is a play on
[11075.04s] the China recovery. They have Dr. Jart
[11077.6s] and some other cool brands. They&#39;ve been
[11079.12s] buying and selling brands for a century.
[11081.279s] It&#39;s family controlled. They will turn
[11083.84s] it around. And
[11088.12s] um Morning Star put out a note
[11092.359s] uh citing the cha stock is extremely
[11095.52s] cheap. Bottom line, we maintain our 120
[11097.84s] per share fair value estimate for wide
[11100.0s] mode Estee Lauder. Shares are
[11101.76s] undervalued as investors price in overly
[11104.08s] pessimistic assumption despite the
[11105.76s] firm&#39;s brand prowess and improving
[11108.88s] execution. So that&#39;s a double from here
[11111.12s] give or take uh and probably a lot more
[11113.439s] when China turns around. Fear and greed
[11115.359s] is starting to tick up. So we see that
[11118.24s] and then earnings of the material sector
[11121.84s] down in the last 60 days 2 and a half%
[11125.2s] 3.4% 4% largely driven by
[11129.279s] uh what was the biggest contributor to
[11131.72s] this? Sherwin
[11134.279s] Williams
[11137.479s] and looks like
[11142.92s] uh Dowo
[11149.0s] Chemical and that&#39;s that. The whole
[11151.439s] group is left for dead there. There are
[11152.96s] a lot of ponies in that pile. We need to
[11155.12s] start paying a lot more attention to IBD
[11157.68s] growth stocks up uh growth estimates up
[11160.72s] 6% and next year up 3%. So find areas in
[11166.399s] this group that is not yet priced in.
[11169.2s] Good luck. Tough to find. Uh and that&#39;s
[11172.08s] that. So uh earnings estimates expected
[11176.08s] growth rate for the quarter to finish at
[11179.2s] 13.6. It was expected to be 6%. Uh and
[11182.96s] that was in the face of all the
[11184.479s] uncertainty. Guidance
[11186.76s] is
[11188.44s] [Music]
[11189.8s] holding where is
[11192.76s] guidance is right around 265. So about
[11196.319s] down 3.6%. We&#39;re kind of holding it at
[11198.88s] those levels. So with that said, let&#39;s
[11200.72s] move on to the ask me anything. Those of
[11203.76s] you who don&#39;t like the ask me anything,
[11205.76s] thank you for joining. We&#39;ll be back
[11207.04s] next week at our normal time. Normal
[11209.359s] plays back in California on Thursday.
[11211.76s] super excited uh to see the family more
[11214.96s] than anything else. And then um we&#39;ll
[11217.84s] get back on a more normal schedule with
[11219.84s] the podcast and the article. First
[11221.96s] question comes
[11230.12s] from Pat McK. Just listened to Hey Tom,
[11234.88s] just listened to an earnings call for
[11236.08s] the first time and really got a ton of
[11237.359s] value from it. Immediately listened to a
[11238.96s] few more. Uh, one thing did stand out on
[11242.399s] Cooper Standard. We covered this a
[11244.16s] couple weeks ago. Pull up the
[11245.6s] Cooperstandard article on hedge
[11247.8s] funips.com. And congratulations on
[11249.92s] starting to do real work and listening
[11251.92s] to the calls. You are on your way,
[11254.2s] homeboy. Uh, York
[11258.279s] Bourgeoa. Uh, hey Mr. Hayes. Hope you
[11262.279s] had a great time in Miami. Nice time in
[11265.359s] Dubai. Still here. While you were at the
[11267.84s] money show, what percentage of both
[11269.439s] presenters and audience members were
[11271.2s] hypnotized by shiny objects? And were
[11273.12s] you surprised by the seemingly large
[11274.56s] amount? Well, if you know the answer,
[11275.84s] why ask the question? Uh, it was
[11278.0s] basically 100%. Second question, if you
[11280.399s] have time, what&#39;s the material
[11281.6s] difference between levered and unlevered
[11283.04s] free cash flows? One is before interest
[11285.6s] expense, one is after interest expense.
[11287.92s] Uh, I like levered because it&#39;s it&#39;s an
[11290.96s] expense. So it&#39;s not if you have to pay
[11293.439s] the expense, it&#39;s not free cash if
[11296.24s] you&#39;re excluding it. So it&#39;s free cash
[11298.479s] after expense. Um,
[11301.84s] uh, leverage is the way to, uh, measure
[11304.0s] it in my humble opinion. Appreciate the
[11306.16s] work as always. Have a safe trip back.
[11307.6s] Thanks, York. Next is from Tim
[11311.319s] D. Thoughts on Reddit. Uh, I think I
[11314.479s] covered this before and, uh, welcome to
[11317.68s] the podcast. I can tell you&#39;re new by
[11319.84s] the question.
[11322.279s] Uh,
[11328.279s] Reddit. Reddit has been cyclical, by the
[11331.04s] way. It&#39;s running hot right
[11336.84s] now. Cash flows, revenues, margins,
[11340.08s] through the roof.
[11343.08s] Um, let&#39;s see.
[11347.16s] Snapshots, financial analysis.
[11351.76s] I mean, this is something
[11353.8s] that you&#39;re making a gamble that it&#39;s
[11356.24s] going to stay relevant. It&#39;s hard to
[11357.52s] make those gamles, but right now it
[11359.76s] looks
[11363.8s] hot. 10 times sales, but it&#39;s making
[11368.439s] money. Price to earnings is 44 times,
[11371.76s] but it&#39;s got earnings growth. So, all
[11374.479s] you can make the bullish argument, this
[11376.16s] is not one that I want to participate
[11377.92s] in. Um, I&#39;m going to pass. This is not a
[11380.96s] quality enough business that I can
[11382.399s] predict the cash flows. So, not for me.
[11385.84s] Uh, but may work for you. Just a
[11388.0s] different
[11391.56s] uh Okay, here&#39;s an article from Korea
[11394.88s] from
[11395.8s] Allen. Honda to scale back on EVs and
[11398.56s] focus on hybrids. That means more money
[11401.359s] for Cooper Standard. They make more on
[11403.84s] hybrids than both IC&#39;s and EVs, but they
[11407.68s] make more on EVs than ICEs. Jason Zen,
[11410.479s] our models are based on the lowest case
[11412.24s] scenario, which is ICE. Uh, swung by
[11414.88s] Nike over the weekend and my wife tried
[11416.56s] on pair of quote Infinity Run running
[11418.88s] shoes and was surprised how comfortable
[11420.24s] it was. I was like, &quot;This can&#39;t be.&quot;
[11421.92s] Pulled out my phone and did a quick
[11423.279s] Google search and bam, Reactex foam.
[11426.64s] Now, why own Nike when you&#39;re a
[11428.64s] shareholder by proxy through Cooper
[11430.399s] Standard? because Cooper Standard makes
[11431.92s] the souls on all the ReactX shoes. Uh,
[11434.72s] this was the most exciting shoe purchase
[11436.399s] in my life and it&#39;s all thanks to you.
[11437.92s] Cheers, Jason. All right,
[11440.2s] man. We have zero attributed to uh Nike
[11444.479s] shoe revenues in our Cooper Standard
[11446.72s] models, but we will take the whipped
[11448.08s] cream and it goes to show. Uh,
[11452.439s] okay. David T, look at Lion. Uh,
[11456.479s] Lionsgate Studios, which just spent
[11458.319s] spend spun out of
[11460.6s] Lionsgate.
[11462.92s] Um, yeah, I think if I&#39;m not mistaken,
[11467.12s] Steven Minutian&#39;s involved in this and
[11469.279s] that guy&#39;s a smart guy. So, if you like
[11473.319s] these kind of dogs, but keep in mind,
[11476.24s] his wife is like an actress. So, this
[11478.24s] might just be a project to get her work.
[11482.12s] Uh I I&#39;ve looked at a lot of these
[11484.56s] Lionsgate things over the years. You
[11487.2s] really have to know the business and
[11488.88s] some of the parts and all that stuff,
[11490.24s] but uh that&#39;s a jockey I would bet with,
[11492.479s] but you you have to be sure it&#39;s a
[11496.08s] financial decision and not a vanity
[11498.88s] project, and I&#39;m not so sure, so I&#39;m not
[11501.12s] going to participate. Good morning.
[11503.04s] Congratulations on the podcast. Can you
[11504.96s] check out West Pharma? I think it is
[11507.04s] interesting given the quality of the
[11508.72s] company. Okay, let&#39;s take a look. This
[11512.8s] is going to be pipeline understanding. I
[11515.04s] mean, we&#39;ll take a quick look at
[11518.2s] the
[11520.76s] financials, but you&#39;re going to have to
[11522.96s] do a lot of work on your own if the
[11524.479s] financials hold
[11526.2s] up. Stocks down, so is cash flow. Looks
[11529.12s] like cash flows, revenues are down,
[11531.359s] margins are down, everything&#39;s down as
[11534.56s] it should be, but cash flow looks like
[11536.399s] it might be recovering a little bit. So,
[11539.6s] um, tell me what the turnaround story is
[11541.84s] and what the drug pipeline is and the
[11543.84s] patent cliffs are. Uh, which is why we
[11546.319s] tend to invest certainly in biotech in
[11549.24s] baskets.
[11551.56s] Um, for me, it&#39;s not enough of a margin
[11554.56s] of safety that I want to get excited
[11556.16s] about it, but I can see why you&#39;re
[11557.76s] interested and it might be worth doing
[11559.12s] extra work.
[11562.84s] Easy listener of hedge fund tips video
[11565.2s] cast for over two years now. Thank you
[11566.72s] very much, Eaz. Um, just had to say
[11570.399s] thank you. You&#39;re welcome. Thank you for
[11571.84s] listening. Your stock picks and analysis
[11573.359s] are always spot-on, and your
[11574.56s] light-hearted style makes learning fun.
[11577.04s] Who knew finance could be this
[11578.56s] entertaining? Your hedge fun tips video
[11580.16s] cast have been the highlight of my week
[11581.76s] for two years, and persistence pays off,
[11584.16s] and yours certainly has. Keep them
[11586.0s] coming. Want you to look into Rio Tinto.
[11588.96s] I know you
[11590.68s] have through
[11593.08s] Albamaro. Okay.
[11599.76s] All right. So, he&#39;s interested in or
[11603.64s] um Bezi is interested in she
[11609.239s] uh okay,
[11611.479s] Rio because of the dividend. That&#39;s not
[11613.84s] a reason to get involved in the stock.
[11615.92s] But let&#39;s take a look at the stock
[11617.92s] because I do think there&#39;s something to
[11619.68s] be said here. And now&#39;s probably the
[11621.6s] time because these do well when emerging
[11624.16s] markets do well. It&#39;s just like, God, a
[11626.96s] lot of good news priced in already, but
[11629.64s] maybe no. Price has gone up, cash flow&#39;s
[11632.56s] gone down, revenues have gone down.
[11634.08s] Yeah, you could play the turnaround
[11635.279s] story, but the market&#39;s been kind of
[11636.64s] giving it credit for the turnaround
[11638.0s] story. Not enough margin of safety for
[11640.0s] me. Uh, not enough reason to own it for
[11642.479s] the dividend because you could lose that
[11644.0s] in one day. So, um, but thank you for
[11647.68s] listening and look for something with a
[11649.52s] little higher margin of safety. Even
[11651.439s] though this might be okay, it&#39;s just not
[11653.76s] worth risking a dollar in our view if we
[11655.76s] can&#39;t get a double or triple in a
[11657.12s] reasonable amount of time. Matt Delp
[11659.08s] Priari, let&#39;s talk about the yen. Jet
[11661.92s] pan rates rising negatively impacted
[11664.72s] global markets. Is this a real concern?
[11666.72s] It was a concern for MAG 7 and we warned
[11669.2s] about that all last year. That&#39;s playing
[11671.279s] out. that will continue to play out
[11673.279s] which is why international is going to
[11674.88s] outperform US and unmagnificent 493 is
[11677.92s] going to outperform MAG 7 and value is
[11681.04s] going to go back to outperforming growth
[11683.12s] as it has for the last 98 years by a
[11687.279s] magnitude of 4.4% 4% per year. Or in
[11690.72s] English, if you put a million dollars in
[11692.399s] value in 1927 or a million dollars in
[11695.439s] growth, you get 68 million more going
[11697.84s] into value, even despite the last 15
[11701.2s] years and the aberrational zero interest
[11703.76s] rate policy period, which is not going
[11706.239s] to persist or reoccur anytime soon. Ewan
[11711.72s] Musaki, avid listener for years. What
[11714.16s] are your thoughts on Mona as a possible
[11716.0s] investment? First off, thanks for your
[11718.0s] long-term loyalty. Uh he&#39;s talking about
[11724.16s] um one with that. You got to understand
[11726.96s] the pipeline, but the problem is
[11732.359s] is Mr. A is they&#39;re blowing through
[11736.0s] their cash. So unless a miracle happens
[11738.0s] with one of their drugs soon, which it
[11740.16s] very well could. Um, so study the
[11742.8s] pipeline and get some level of
[11745.0s] confidence in what&#39;s going to be
[11747.12s] happening imminently because in the
[11748.72s] meantime, this is what we call a cash
[11753.08s] incinerator. Burning cash like it&#39;s
[11755.52s] going out of style to the tune
[11759.72s] of this. Is this serious? Four billion a
[11763.52s] year.
[11765.92s] Let me
[11768.04s] see. I mean, you know how hard you have
[11770.8s] to work to incinerate $4 billion a
[11775.399s] year? You could work a 100 hours a week
[11778.0s] and not spend $4 billion a year. Let&#39;s
[11780.239s] take a look
[11781.64s] at how they&#39;re doing this feat of
[11785.359s] burning $4 billion a year and not making
[11788.8s] any money.
[11793.52s] First
[11794.76s] off, the balance
[11798.6s] sheet, they got
[11810.2s] 6.87 billion of cash at the end of the
[11813.64s] year. We probably have
[11816.439s] no debt.
[11826.479s] No material debt. What are they doing on
[11828.72s] the cash flow here
[11831.399s] though? They
[11838.76s] are literally blowing $4
[11841.88s] billion the last two years. So, uh, the
[11845.439s] only reason you would get involved in
[11846.72s] this if is if after you do your
[11848.399s] research, you&#39;re damn certain they&#39;re
[11850.16s] going to have some blockbuster drug in
[11852.0s] the next 12 months. Otherwise, they&#39;re
[11853.76s] going to be out of cash in two years.
[11855.279s] So, um, not for
[11859.8s] me. Moving along,
[11863.0s] Vle
[11865.8s] Vahasari, love your perspective on
[11867.84s] Alexandria real estate as a potential
[11869.439s] turnaround opportunity. Same successful
[11871.6s] strategy with Vernon. high quality rate,
[11873.84s] strong track record, top tier assets. Do
[11875.76s] you see any parallels? I don&#39;t like
[11878.399s] multif family here. I think all of the
[11881.84s] excess
[11883.399s] inventory is going I I if the starter
[11886.96s] house thesis is correct and the family
[11889.04s] formation thesis is correct, which I
[11891.2s] believe it is, I think we&#39;re going to
[11892.399s] have a glut of multif family. And I
[11894.319s] think that&#39;s going to be and considering
[11896.0s] all the people you&#39;re seeing now that
[11897.439s] are so excited about multif family, it
[11899.04s] just feels like it&#39;s the wrong time to
[11900.96s] be getting involved. The right time was
[11903.92s] a while back, Alexandria, maybe a decade
[11908.08s] back. The wrong time is when those
[11911.52s] people are laying off to you and
[11913.12s] teaching you how to buy B multif family.
[11915.279s] Not a good
[11916.359s] formula.
[11919.88s] Alexandria real estate a
[11932.319s] Oh, by the way, there was a guy and his
[11935.52s] family at the money show who wanted me
[11937.92s] to look at Owen&#39;s
[11939.56s] Corning. Uh, yeah. All right,
[11942.319s] Alexandria. Let&#39;s just take a look here.
[11945.279s] It&#39;s kind of priced in a lot of bad news
[11947.04s] here. Cash flow
[11948.439s] continues. Revenues are going up. Cash
[11950.64s] flow is rolling over. Margins are
[11952.319s] starting to recover. What&#39;s the
[11954.479s] dividend?
[11958.64s] Let me see. I should be able to find it
[11965.16s] here. Net debt is 12
[11968.92s] billion. So, it&#39;s pricing as if they&#39;re
[11971.2s] not going to be able to refinance some
[11972.56s] of the
[11973.8s] debt. Let&#39;s take a look at
[11976.6s] the financials.
[11987.279s] balance
[11991.479s] sheet.
[11992.67s] [Music]
[11997.0s] Okay. All right. They got a half a
[11999.12s] billion dollars of cash and they&#39;ve got
[12002.8s] $12 billion of debt, but it&#39;s secured by
[12005.12s] the properties.
[12008.16s] Cash
[12009.319s] flow
[12010.74s] [Music]
[12017.88s] is pretty decent.
[12027.76s] is the
[12028.86s] [Music]
[12034.6s] uh see if they put the dividend here.
[12040.96s] I personally don&#39;t want to be in multif
[12042.84s] family
[12044.68s] but you know this come in a
[12055.08s] lot that I&#39;m inclined to say 100% worth
[12058.88s] doing extra work on it. um you have to
[12063.399s] be open to the idea that they might have
[12066.0s] to cut their dividend if they have any
[12067.6s] problem with financing, but not probably
[12070.479s] won&#39;t be an issue. And then you really
[12072.239s] want to know the properties. I mean, in
[12073.84s] Verernado&#39;s case, I knew all the
[12075.52s] properties in New York and they were the
[12076.88s] highest. So, you get a 7%
[12078.68s] yield, it&#39;s probably okay. Uh you just
[12082.319s] got to do more work on it. I I think if
[12085.359s] you love the idea, it&#39;s worth now
[12087.359s] starting to do the work. Uh, good
[12092.359s] question. Okay, here is from uh Albert
[12095.84s] Rud and his lovely family. I got to meet
[12097.92s] his daughters. I think one&#39;s at MIT and
[12100.0s] one is at Rice, so he did a good job
[12102.239s] from
[12103.239s] Sarasota.
[12106.279s] Um, Owens Corning on the basis he
[12109.2s] listened to my house healthc care
[12111.52s] present, not healthcare, housing
[12115.16s] presentation. I don&#39;t know which time
[12116.96s] zone I&#39;m on, guys. I started in Pacific
[12119.84s] Standard Time. I went to Eastern. I
[12121.84s] don&#39;t know what time zone this is. Uh so
[12125.279s] it&#39;s come in about 25
[12135.0s] 30%. I think where I came out on this
[12138.08s] was if I owned it from much lower
[12139.92s] levels, I would be a hodler, i.e. hold.
[12143.92s] If I didn&#39;t own it, I would be I would
[12147.52s] probably want to see a little more
[12148.64s] weakness, which you might not get. I
[12151.2s] think you&#39;re generally okay here. Would
[12153.12s] I put new money to work in this? No.
[12154.8s] There&#39;s not enough margin of safety for
[12156.399s] me, but um would I add here if I owned
[12160.72s] it? No. I think it&#39;s a great business. I
[12163.12s] think your thinking is correct. I think
[12164.88s] you own it from much lower levels. In
[12168.239s] which case, hodddle it. It might go
[12170.239s] lower before it goes higher, but there&#39;s
[12172.8s] no reason to really panic out of it
[12175.359s] anytime soon. And um the housing plays
[12179.359s] that I mentioned are the ones that I
[12181.6s] would favor. But uh definitely
[12184.08s] appreciate the question. Appreciate you
[12185.6s] coming to all the presentations and
[12187.12s] introducing your lovely family. Les
[12189.279s] Edelman interested in your thoughts on
[12191.439s] WNC.
[12215.0s] Wabash.
[12220.439s] Okay. I like the concept. Cash flow the
[12223.52s] rec the What did this thing do? I mean,
[12226.88s] the revenues are scary to me. They&#39;ve
[12228.72s] come down a lot, but they&#39;ve done that
[12230.359s] before. Seems to be a very cyclical
[12233.12s] business. The margins, it this is a
[12235.84s] trade. This is not a business that you
[12237.6s] want to own. I I I don&#39;t even know what
[12239.2s] it does yet, and I&#39;m just telling you
[12240.72s] this is not an own forever. This is a
[12242.399s] trade. Engineered Solutions for
[12244.0s] Transportation, Logistics,
[12245.04s] Infrastructure in the US. Uh,
[12246.96s] Transportation Solutions Part and
[12248.479s] Service offers dry van trailers,
[12250.8s] platform trailers, refrigerated
[12252.479s] trailers, stainless steel, aluminum tran
[12255.479s] trailers, dry freight bulk bodies,
[12258.319s] cargo, flatbed bodies, truck mounting,
[12260.56s] blah blah blah. It&#39;s probably not a
[12262.0s] business that should be public. This
[12263.279s] would be a good private equity target.
[12265.92s] Um, I think it works as a trade. Decent
[12269.279s] find. Let&#39;s just take a look at the
[12270.88s] balance sheet to make sure they&#39;re not
[12272.399s] going to have financing risk and then we
[12275.12s] will move
[12283.96s] on. 115 million in
[12288.2s] cash, 400 million in debt. It&#39;s it&#39;s
[12291.52s] probably okay. Again, it&#39;s a trade. It&#39;s
[12294.359s] not You&#39;re just playing for a bounce.
[12296.96s] Um, Thomas Bar, thanks for all you do.
[12299.76s] Really enjoy your show. Relate strongly
[12301.84s] to your product. Want us to talk about
[12309.239s] iHeart. I Okay, this guy is super
[12312.08s] excited about iHeart Radio. My guess is
[12314.399s] this thing is overly indebted and you&#39;re
[12317.84s] taking financing risk in a dying
[12320.319s] business, but it&#39;s down a lot, so that&#39;s
[12322.64s] why he likes it.
[12325.72s] Um,
[12327.82s] [Music]
[12334.04s] IHRT negative free cash flow. Revenues
[12338.08s] down and then flat for almost a decade.
[12341.12s] Margins continue to contract. This is
[12344.2s] uh a stock that has fundamentals
[12347.04s] consistent with what the price has done.
[12350.08s] The question is, is it going to turn? is
[12352.96s] their one last puff in this cigar butt.
[12355.04s] They got 250 million of cash and they&#39;ve
[12358.08s] got
[12359.88s] um $5 billion of debt. This is pricing
[12363.6s] like it&#39;s going out of business and that
[12365.279s] is not a far-fetched idea, but not a
[12368.64s] guarantee either. So,
[12372.279s] um it&#39;s a gamble. I don&#39;t take gamles.
[12375.279s] Rule number one is don&#39;t lose money.
[12376.8s] Rule number two is don&#39;t forget rule
[12378.56s] number one. It&#39;s a might make it, but I
[12381.76s] wouldn&#39;t. It&#39;s a coin flip. You might
[12383.359s] gamble and win. You might gamble and
[12384.88s] lose. I&#39;d
[12386.439s] say go to Foxwoods and bet on
[12390.359s] black. Pete Bass, what would your
[12393.68s] opinion be on Pterodine? Great business.
[12397.8s] Ter, is it the right time to
[12401.0s] buy? Uh, it&#39;s probably okay.
[12408.56s] This has a
[12409.96s] DNA of good things over the years. Let&#39;s
[12413.76s] see what it&#39;s doing
[12416.439s] lately. Cash flow and revenue are
[12418.72s] showing signs of recovering. Margins are
[12421.68s] showing
[12422.76s] signs. Uh I&#39;m sure the balance sheet is
[12426.239s] probably
[12428.04s] okay. Let&#39;s take a
[12433.64s] look. And
[12443.6s] 600 million of
[12446.92s] cash
[12450.53s] [Music]
[12452.359s] longterm debt 600. So probably okay. I
[12456.8s] think you&#39;re probably okay here. Uh just
[12459.359s] understand the business before you buy
[12461.96s] anything. Uh okay. Here is from Eric F.
[12468.319s] He&#39;s asking where&#39;s the where&#39;s the uh
[12470.96s] land? There&#39;s a lot more in the metro
[12472.64s] than you think. We only need 517,000
[12474.88s] acres of like 470 million and more of it
[12478.399s] is in metro areas than you think. Go
[12480.56s] look at the slides in the article of the
[12482.84s] week. Next, Chris
[12490.2s] Williamson. You&#39;re
[12492.68s] right on Hormell. He&#39;s saying that
[12496.319s] upside is probably capped at a double. I
[12498.479s] agree. Uh but that&#39;s fine. It&#39;s good to
[12500.88s] have a defensive one in there here and
[12502.64s] there. Thoughts on Murphy
[12504.68s] Oil?
[12513.399s] Uh I looked at this one on my own. I
[12516.72s] think this one&#39;s okay.
[12536.279s] See? Yeah, it&#39;s that one&#39;s probably
[12538.68s] okay.
[12541.72s] Um, Micah Kelsey, thank you for
[12544.72s] conducting the Cooper Standards CEO
[12546.56s] interview. Cooper Standards printing
[12548.08s] cash just like you predicted. Are you
[12549.92s] looking at adding Estee Lauder at this
[12551.76s] price? Keep thinking it&#39;s bottomed out.
[12554.16s] Uh no, but we&#39;re we we&#39;re holding, you
[12557.359s] know, we don&#39;t uh we&#39;re not adding,
[12559.279s] we&#39;re not subtracting. We&#39;re just
[12560.8s] comfortable with the position. We sized
[12562.479s] it according to the risk, which was
[12564.479s] serious. It was a play on China, so we
[12567.12s] already had exposure. They&#39;ve got free
[12568.96s] cash flow. They&#39;re turning it around.
[12571.04s] It&#39;s going to take a little while to
[12572.399s] build a new shareholder base, but no, we
[12574.64s] didn&#39;t add, we didn&#39;t subtract. We&#39;re
[12576.16s] just hold hodling and we&#39;re perfectly
[12578.0s] fine with that. Manic Bouani
[12590.2s] uh Madak Vajani says quote all the
[12593.12s] fundamental stories the last guy
[12594.479s] mentioned end quote. Are you getting a
[12595.84s] cup with that on it? No. Um but thank
[12599.2s] you for the comment. Daniel Borman, hey
[12602.399s] Tom, what are your thoughts on Yeti
[12603.92s] stock? We&#39;ve covered this one a bunch of
[12606.0s] times. I continue to look at it.
[12608.88s] Continue to pass. Can&#39;t think of a
[12611.92s] reason why I&#39;m passing other than just
[12616.239s] instinct and no position in the
[12618.239s] portfolio. But yeah, it&#39;s a high return
[12620.72s] on invested capital business. There are
[12623.439s] still some growth left. Cash flow is
[12625.359s] recovering. There&#39;s nothing to really
[12626.88s] not love. So the answer is I think
[12629.359s] you&#39;re right and I want to do more work
[12631.92s] on it and it may take off without me and
[12635.52s] and and but it destroyed a lot of
[12637.52s] people. It&#39;s a broken growth stock. Now
[12639.52s] the value buyers can come in and it may
[12641.84s] take another year to build a base or it
[12643.52s] may take off without us but I think
[12646.239s] you&#39;re in the neighborhood of what would
[12647.6s] be something worth looking at. What&#39;s
[12649.2s] your thoughts on R&amp;B?
[12653.16s] uh higher it&#39;s going to be part of the
[12656.08s] trade deal. Victor
[12659.399s] Hansen, hi. Best finance podcast
[12662.0s] recommending to everyone. Thank you.
[12663.6s] Superior
[12664.6s] industry.
[12666.52s] [Music]
[12668.2s] Um I think I like this
[12672.439s] one. Let me see. Oh, what the hell
[12676.0s] happened
[12677.479s] here? Superior Industries. This thing
[12679.84s] must be going
[12680.92s] BK because that is trading like it&#39;s
[12687.319s] death. Let&#39;s
[12691.0s] see. All right. You&#39;re telling me the
[12693.279s] debt is not maturing until
[12697.56s] 2028. They&#39;re free cash flow positive by
[12700.479s] a hair. Revenues are declining. Margins
[12704.239s] are starting to bottom out.
[12709.86s] [Music]
[12717.16s] Uh, wow. What the hell happened to this
[12722.279s] business? Let&#39;s
[12733.08s] see. Let&#39;s see.
[12738.84s] 480 million. They only have 10 million
[12741.92s] of cash and 480 million of debt. So, the
[12744.16s] market&#39;s saying it&#39;s going bankrupt. Uh
[12747.04s] they might not have to refinance, but
[12749.76s] can they service the debt is the
[12752.84s] problem. That&#39;s the problem, ladies and
[12755.359s] gentlemen. So, you and you know, so they
[12758.08s] got negative10 million of free cash
[12760.16s] flow. They got 10 million of cash, 450
[12762.0s] million of debt. Trading like a
[12763.72s] bankruptcy. and it may very well be a
[12766.16s] bankruptcy. So,
[12772.52s] uh, this is a gamble. You got to see if
[12775.12s] they have assets they can sell. How are
[12776.64s] they going to raise cash? What the
[12777.92s] turnaround plan is, but you are playing
[12779.76s] on a nice
[12781.88s] edge. Go to Moheaggan Sun, bet on black.
[12785.2s] Griffin Brown, one of Buffett, Munger,
[12788.08s] and Graham&#39;s great biggest lessons, if
[12789.6s] not was the power of compounding over
[12791.04s] decades.
[12794.479s] Well, they they had a different
[12795.76s] structure, okay? They had permanent
[12797.359s] capital. So, what Buffett did before he
[12799.92s] had a public vehicle was exactly what we
[12802.319s] did. A lot of turnarounds for doubles
[12803.84s] and triples. And then when he got a
[12806.0s] permanent capital structure and public
[12807.68s] company and unlimited free float coming
[12809.439s] in from the insurance premiums, he moved
[12811.439s] up and did buy forever businesses, which
[12814.08s] don&#39;t go on sale very much, but they
[12816.64s] compound over time. Different structure,
[12819.279s] different strategy, same guy. It wasn&#39;t
[12821.52s] Munger that twisted his arm that he was
[12823.279s] doing things all wrong. Buffett does
[12824.64s] what he wants to do. He&#39;s the goat.
[12826.72s] Munger was just a sideshow. That was a
[12828.88s] huge contributor. But Munger, Buffett is
[12832.0s] what made the magic. Uh, and he adjusted
[12834.64s] based on the capital uh structure that
[12838.16s] he had less than he did because he
[12840.64s] didn&#39;t think it wasn&#39;t that he didn&#39;t
[12842.479s] think what he did when he was managing
[12847.08s] partnerships wasn&#39;t better. It&#39;s what
[12849.52s] made sense for the structure. His
[12851.359s] performance was better doing the
[12852.72s] turnarounds than it was when he got the
[12855.04s] law of large numbers and he went for
[12856.479s] quality. But the quality matched
[12860.12s] the constant inflow of premiums at zero
[12865.279s] to negative cost that he could just put
[12867.76s] to work set and forget versus uh do
[12870.88s] shorter time. His priorities changed and
[12873.12s] his structure changed and that&#39;s why he
[12875.04s] did that. So why we have a three to five
[12876.64s] year horizon is because we are go we
[12880.16s] have to perform in a reasonable amount
[12882.0s] of time uh and we want to have excess
[12885.6s] returns. So that&#39;s why we do what we do
[12887.2s] and how we do it. We will find
[12888.88s] businesses that will want to own for a
[12890.64s] lifetime. But the ones that double and
[12892.96s] triple the fact that it got to the point
[12895.359s] that it can have that type of expected
[12897.2s] value in a short period of time tells me
[12898.8s] that&#39;s not a hold forever. Those are the
[12900.64s] businesses that fall 10 20%. you buy it,
[12903.04s] you hold it, but you&#39;re not going to
[12904.72s] dramatically outperform in the short
[12906.239s] term. And that&#39;s why we uh do that. Is
[12908.92s] UNH Enron are the buy of a lifetime? The
[12911.84s] answer is you can&#39;t know. So just
[12913.52s] because it&#39;s in the headlines doesn&#39;t
[12914.96s] mean you have to play, Eric. And for
[12916.64s] that reason, I pass. It could it could
[12918.239s] rebound back to 600 tomorrow. I would it
[12921.68s] wouldn&#39;t even phase me. Um
[12924.96s] um and it could absolutely be a lot
[12926.96s] worse because you don&#39;t know, you know,
[12928.88s] where there&#39;s smoke. there could be fire
[12930.56s] and there&#39;s cockroaches behind the wall
[12932.56s] board. So, you have to but at some point
[12935.2s] it might be worth to get involved. It&#39;s
[12937.12s] just not now in my view even though you
[12939.2s] had all the insider buyers. Thou dot
[12941.8s] protestth. Um maybe it&#39;s all over in a
[12944.72s] week, but I don&#39;t think so. Department
[12946.16s] of Justice doesn&#39;t announce that and
[12948.0s] just let it go like our bad. They&#39;re
[12950.16s] clean back to back to business as
[12952.56s] normal. It&#39;s going to drag on and it&#39;s
[12954.16s] going to be an overhang for a while and
[12955.84s] a distraction. Hey Tom, thank you for
[12958.239s] sharing.
[12959.96s] BFIT, thank you for sharing the
[12962.16s] knowledge. You&#39;re the best. Thank you.
[12963.84s] That&#39;s very kind.
[12971.08s] BFI company is a lowcost gym
[12974.6s] operator. Market trend. Okay. So, it&#39;s
[12980.68s] basically a Planet Fitness, tons of
[12983.96s] cash, revenues,
[12988.52s] margins. Uh, this one might be a good
[12990.96s] one. I don&#39;t like the fattiness, no pun
[12993.92s] intang
[12996.439s] um the gym business. I&#39;ve seen them all
[12998.96s] come and go, but this one looks good for
[13001.6s] now.
[13002.84s] So, I think you&#39;re probably on to
[13006.12s] something and definitely worth doing the
[13008.8s] work on
[13009.8s] it and just know that that business is
[13012.64s] not a hold forever business. Maybe get a
[13015.359s] double out of it and call it a day. If
[13018.0s] that you just see the balance sheet and
[13020.239s] cash flow real
[13023.319s] quick, 58 million of
[13028.12s] cash, and then long-term debt is a
[13034.279s] billion. What&#39;s the free cash flow? So,
[13036.8s] that&#39;s something that&#39;s an alarm for
[13043.319s] me. I I I don&#39;t like that business
[13045.92s] generally. It looked decent at first
[13048.56s] blush, but as I look a little
[13053.88s] closer. I mean, the cash flow is pretty
[13061.64s] good. Maybe do more work. Ru Reynolds
[13066.96s] will mull.
[13069.6s] Oh, this 10-year-old at the Irone
[13073.359s] um wants to be short Cooper Standard.
[13076.8s] And uh on a margin compression thesis,
[13083.399s] um I&#39;m just going to
[13086.68s] say I&#39;ll take the other side of that
[13089.04s] trade and let&#39;s see where we are in 12
[13091.12s] months, ladies and gentlemen. Uh good
[13094.239s] luck with that one. Joe
[13096.84s] Vandy, EW
[13099.8s] scripts,
[13115.8s] SSP, assuming this is like a TV company
[13118.8s] or something. Let&#39;s see.
[13124.0s] Free cash flow revenues. Huh? What do
[13127.84s] these guys
[13130.04s] do? Must have a lot of debt. Yeah,
[13133.68s] national news and entertainment. There&#39;s
[13135.359s] a bunch of
[13136.52s] these. God, this is a tough business.
[13138.96s] This is a cigar butt business. I&#39;m
[13143.239s] guessing the balance sheet looks like
[13146.0s] death.
[13152.72s] 23 million of
[13158.68s] cash, 2.7 billion of debt. Go to Las
[13162.08s] Vegas Sands. Bet it all on black. This
[13164.64s] is not for me. It might work as a trade.
[13168.08s] I&#39;m not going to participate and I&#39;m not
[13169.92s] going to lose sleep if you get rich on
[13171.439s] it. Error of omission, not commission.
[13175.359s] Rule number one, don&#39;t lose money. Rule
[13177.2s] number two, don&#39;t forget rule number
[13181.56s] one. Charles River Labs from
[13185.96s] Martin GR ZY
[13191.08s] W
[13196.76s] Grizzki. Say that three times
[13199.88s] fast. CRL
[13215.84s] This is going to take a while. This is a
[13217.6s] broken Momo stock. I know it&#39;s down a
[13219.6s] lot. Look at cash flow, though. Record
[13222.279s] highs. Margins compressing. Show me how
[13225.12s] margins are going to turn around. Uh, I
[13228.319s] think you&#39;re probably going to be right.
[13230.16s] And I think it&#39;s going to take a lot
[13231.439s] longer than you think to turn around.
[13234.0s] Lot of broken people
[13235.64s] here. Uh let&#39;s take a look at the
[13237.92s] balance sheet just so we can take
[13239.68s] solveny risk off the table
[13242.439s] hopefully. 2.7 billion in debt. How much
[13246.92s] cash? Something&#39;s hurting with the
[13249.04s] model. So you got to get comfort in the
[13250.96s] business before you invest a
[13259.399s] dollar. 194 in cash.
[13267.279s] 2.2 billion in debt. This is not a great
[13270.479s] great
[13271.399s] situation. Uh understand why it&#39;s down
[13274.16s] so much. What&#39;s the turnaround plan?
[13275.84s] You&#39;re going to have to do work on this
[13277.04s] one because they don&#39;t have all the time
[13278.399s] in the world with that balance sheet.
[13279.76s] They probably have some time, but not
[13282.239s] all the time. So, with that said, we&#39;ll
[13285.12s] be back next week. Normal time, normal
[13288.16s] place. In the meantime, make it a great
[13290.399s] one. Bye for now.
