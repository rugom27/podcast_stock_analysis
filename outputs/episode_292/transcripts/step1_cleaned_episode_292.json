I&#39;m Tom Hayes and this is your 292nd videocast podcast for the week ending May 20th, 2025 live from Dubai.\n\n### MEDIA_APPEARANCE_RECAP\nBut my next guests both say there&#39;s another name to have in your portfolio who&#39;s also bringing the happiest place on earth to the Middle East. Let&#39;s get right to our floor show. Joining me now is Grey Hill Capital Chairman Thomas Hayes and Freedom Capital Markets chief global strategist Jay Woods live from the New York Stock Exchange. Tom, I&#39;ll start with you. You both like Disney. There&#39;s no question about it. You know, uh, this rally that we&#39;ve seen in the last four weeks, it&#39;s like Buffett always said, if you wait for the Robins to sing, it&#39;s already spring. We&#39;re up 15% since Donald Trump tweeted. Now is a great time to buy stocks. Last week, he said US is going to boom. Disney is a beneficiary. We were on the network four weeks ago saying, &quot;Buy Disney at $85. It&#39;s 111.&quot; Guess what? It&#39;s going over 200 over the next three years. All of their divisions are hitting on all cylinders. Mid double digit growth. the cruise ships, the parks, streaming, 180 million subscribers. They added two and a half million subscribers. This is a high quality business with a durable mode. Well, and Jay, the concern as we were going into Disney&#39;s earnings was worries about the theme parks and that ended up being uh one of the positives along with of course who was going to replace uh Bob Iger and Disney Plus. Jay, why do you like Disney? Well, I look at it from a technical level. This stock had been beaten down for years.

We\nfinally  had a nice constructive base and then a breakout above that 200 day moving average, a breakout of a long-term downtrend and then you put all the fundamental stories that the last guest just mentioned. And yeah, this is a recipe where if you want to get in this name, riskreward, there&#39;s much greater reward on the horizon than the risks.

Now they&#39;ve covered the shorts. Now they have to chase up. They did not believe this was going to take place. They&#39;re g every single headline.

Like Donald Trump said, the market is going higher.\n### HEADLINES_AND_NEWS\nwe are still in this this tariff environment. We have this 90-day pause with China, which is good news for a company like Walmart. We&#39;re getting Walmart earnings tomorrow. That&#39;s going to be at 7:00 a.m. Eastern time. You say that that Walmart is going to be the barometer for the tariff trade because of how that they characterize they handle what has been the last quarter for them, which of course was concerns about their supply chain. Yeah, I think we&#39;re still a far way from certainty in this market. We&#39;re getting a little more certain, but uh there are a lot more\n\n Technically, it&#39;s blessed as well. So, I love it for a long-term play and put it away. We also showed our viewers while you were speaking, Jay, uh Uber, you like Uber, you say that this is a stock that&#39;s going to be 120 bucks by the end of the year.  Let&#39;s talk about the macro story because one of the things you say and I think this is so interesting. You say but the good news there&#39;s a lot of trapped bears out there. I like that terminology and what you say is that each new trade deal is as it&#39;s announced is forcing them to buy everybody that sold wrong. Yeah, you bet. Beginning of April record selling $1.1 trillion dollar of equity sold in the whole by hedge funds and CTAs. Every single new bit of positive news. Now they&#39;ve covered the shorts. Now they have to chase up. They did not believe this was going to take place. They&#39;re g every single headline. And by the way, earnings earnings growth was double what was expected. Even in the face of uncertainty, now that we have more certainty, guess what&#39;s going to happen? Upgrades. Upgrades to guidance. They&#39;re going to have to buy more and more and more. Like Donald Trump said, the market is going higher.  just to be clear, I mean, we are still in this this tariff environment. We have this 90-day pause with China, which is good news for a company like Walmart. We&#39;re getting Walmart earnings tomorrow. That&#39;s going to be at 7:00 a.m. Eastern time.

We have this 90-day pause with China, which is good news for a company like Walmart. We&#39;re getting Walmart earnings tomorrow. That&#39;s going to be at 7:00 a.m. Eastern time.

Yeah, I think we&#39;re still a far way from certainty in this market. We&#39;re getting a little more certain, but uh there are a lot more questions\n\n### ASK_ME_ANYTHING_QA\n\non the tariff front and I think Walmart is the bellweather that may be able to give us a little peak behind the curtain. They were the first company to really guide in January. They turned over in January before we peaked February 19th. Broke a long-term downtrend, held the 200 day moving average, coming back, but still not back to levels where it was trading before. Granted, it was up 100% over 12 months between December, December last year. Now, it&#39;s given back a little bit. Uh we&#39;ll see what that guide is. if they can tell us that inventory levels are fine, they&#39;re not concerned about tariffs, then uh we&#39;re a little more clear about what the future will be as far as the consumer goes. So, I&#39;m watching it closely and uh right now it&#39;s at an area where I&#39;ll wait to see how things shake out, but if it does sell off, I would buy it towards that 91 to 86 level uh for a long-term play and put it away. Yeah. No, I mean, and the concerns about your Walmart, your Target are fair enough. And also, Tom, we&#39;re going to get a big data dump in the morning. So, we&#39;re going to get retail sales. We&#39;re going to get um we&#39;re going to get initial jobless claims uh PPI that and then we also have uh Fed Chairman Jerome Pal uh speaking. So there&#39;s there&#39;s a lot at play tomorrow that could could rock the markets. This is the big question between the hard data and the soft data. Consumers are saying the world is ending, but they&#39;re going out and spending like there&#39;s no tomorrow. So let&#39;s see if it holds true and we get good retail numbers tomorrow. That&#39;ll be the catalyst. You know, looking in the rearview mirror, we we definitely see the uncertainty. looking through the windshield, which is what the stock market does. That uncertainty is mitigating. We&#39;ve had the VIX crushed. The uncertainty has come out of the market. We look forward to positive things moving forward. And you&#39;re both very bullish. Jay, is there anything that you&#39;re concerned about right now that could upset the market, upset the momentum that we had because, you know, we were climbing this wall of worry was so unfortunate during the all the tariff drama. If that indeed is behind us and these trade deals continue to be cut once President Trump gets back from the Middle East, does that tell you that the rest of the year is going to be positive? Well, we&#39;ve just kicked the can down the proverbial road for now. We still have 90 days on China, 90 days on our some of our allies. These tax levels, these tariff levels will have an impact on the bottom line. So once we get some more clarity on that 10% across the board, that seems to be the magic number that the market is absorbing. But uh we still do not know exactly how this will resolve. But we do like the progress. The one thing we do know, the worst seems to be over. That wash out, that April 7th low, that was worst case scenario, panic, capitulation, sentiment at all-time lows. As a contrarian, as someone that follows these markets, that was the time to buy. Now, I&#39;m taking a little on the sidelines because this process, this V-shaped recovery probably will pause before we make new highs. Watch your favorite stock, Cheryl. Nvidia when they report on March on May 28th. I know we always talk about that every time I&#39;m on the show, but that will be a tell because we did see the Mag 7 stocks continue to spend. Their numbers should be good. They were good last quarter, but we were afraid of deepseat. Now we&#39;re afraid of tariffs and China relations. So, let&#39;s see how they do. If Nvidia can break out to new highs, and we still have 16 points to go, then uh the the bullish horns will be sprouting out of my head. Right now, I&#39;m kind of on the sidelines letting things digest. Well, I think these deals that President Trump has has been inking uh so far in the Middle East, and it&#39;s only day two of his his trip. Boy, I tell you, this is this is magic for Nvidia and and obviously a lot of those companies that are that are trailing him right now and following him around to these meetings, these these summits in particular with the Saudis. Uh Jay Woods, Tom Hayes, guys, thank you so much. Great to have you here for the top of the show. I really appreciate it. Thank you, Shirley. All right. Well, President Trump making his second stop on his three and we&#39;re back. Then I had the pleasure to do the entire hour on Yahoo Finance with Julie Heyman. Want to thank Julie and Justin Oliver. Uh we fortunately Stephen was able to edit this so you don&#39;t have to listen to the whole hour. He got like the top uh um key points uh key minutes in from that. So we&#39;ll listen in here. my co-host for the hour, Thomas Hayes, Great Hill Capital chairman and managing member. Um, and Tom, obviously we&#39;ve seen markets rebound and recover a lot of ground in a short period of time. The S&amp;P 500 now a little bit positive on the year. What happens now? Well, we have a lot of what we call trapped bears. Okay. The data shows that in early April, you had $1.1 trillion of selling in US equities. That was predominantly hedge funds and CTAs. So, first you had the short covering rally after the tweet, the famous, &quot;It&#39;s a good time to buy stocks on April 9th.&quot; Now the market&#39;s up 15%. So, they&#39;ve covered their shorts. They&#39;re now chased and forced buyers. So, I think as we continue to see more deals cross the tape and there have been rumblings, more deals are on the way. You&#39;re going to have forced buyers. That said, from a trading standpoint, I think you move 15% in a few weeks. You probably consolidate a little bit and a lot of people have jumped in Johnny come lately. Sometimes you get a three four percent pullback just to kind of shake those the the weak hands out before we move higher. But earnings are super strong. They the earnings growth rate was twice what we expected for this quarter. We were expecting 6%. We got 13%. Estimates have held up even in the face of all of that uncertainty. Now that some of that uncertainty is removed, we could start to see guidance rip higher. And to your point on the dollar, that&#39;s going to help earnings in the back half. It&#39;s been weak. I mean, some of the uncert This sounds awfully bullish here, Tom. I mean, some of the uncertainty is removed, but we got 90 days. There&#39;s still 30% tariffs on Chinese goods coming in. There&#39;s still 10% tariffs on everything else. You know, these companies that came out and pulled their forecast, I don&#39;t hear them coming out and saying, &quot;Actually, now we have a forecast for you.&quot; Right. So, has the has the equation change? I mean, how much has has the equation for decision makers at corporations really changed? Yeah. Well, if if we look at things were in their worst case a few weeks ago, and 2026 earnings still held up above $300 per share on the S&amp;P 500, which is 18.5 times next year&#39;s earnings, the 10-year average is 18.3 times. So, I would say the tariff news has only gotten better in the last few weeks. So, if guidance was able to h hold up in the worst case scenario, as uh companies start to report again in the following quarter, which were far, they&#39;re not going to come out mid quarter and say, &quot;Hey, by the way, we did no guidance. Now, we&#39;re going to throw some guidance out. Uh, but they&#39;ll start to talk to analysts. Analysts will start to upgrade. You&#39;re seeing it now. All the PE, you know, it&#39;s funny seeing these reports from different different sellside houses. One week they&#39;re saying recession chances high. The next week they&#39;re saying no recession and they&#39;re just adapting to this and companies now are going to come off the sidelines. They&#39;ve been paused. They&#39;ve just been saying we&#39;re not doing anything. We&#39;re not making any investments for the last four, six weeks. Now, you&#39;re going to see CEO confidence, CFO confidence. And by the way, what&#39;s so interesting, we had record buyback announcements year to date? 665 billion. So while hedge funds were selling in the hole, guess who was buying? Corporations believe in the future. Even in the face of all that uncertainty, they were putting their money to work to buy shares in this is going to be a positive thing prospectively. Um the other thing I&#39;m curious about is additional trade deals. None of them are actual deals, by the way. They&#39;re all framework. They&#39;re all plans to make a deal. Yeah. Well, here they&#39;re not details. All I&#39;m asking is, are we going to get diminishing returns from these announcements going forward? I mean, China was really the big one. China was the the big one. Europe will be very, very important. But at the end of the day, here&#39;s the thing. If if President Trump had come out and said, &quot;We&#39;re going to charge everyone 10%.&quot; Okay? There&#39;s no way he would have ended up with 10%. So, he came out, he threw a grenade in the room, he blew up the entire system. and he said, &quot;We&#39;re going to tariff you 145%. We&#39;re going to tariff you 80%.&quot; Now 10% looks like the deal of the century and it&#39;s an additional three $400 billion into our coffers. So uh\n\n analysts. Analysts will start to upgrade. You&#39;re seeing it now. All the PE, you know, it&#39;s funny seeing these reports from different different sellside houses. One week they&#39;re saying recession chances high. The next week they&#39;re saying no recession and they&#39;re just adapting to this and companies now are going to come off the sidelines. They&#39;ve been paused.

So, he came out, he threw a grenade in the room, he blew up the entire system. and he said, &quot;We&#39;re going to tariff you 145%. We&#39;re going to tariff you 80%.&quot; Now 10% looks like the deal of the century and it&#39;s an additional three $400 billion into our coffers. So uh\n### MISCELLANEOUS\nwith that said  that we&#39;re paying for well that&#39;s questionable because you know we had tariffs that were put into place in 2018 2019 that&#39;s a very different place for inflation. you saw diff disinflationary. So like washing machines, whirlpool, the price went up like literally shortterm for a matter of months. 2 years later, the price per unit was actually lower. So there&#39;s something to be said. I I think it&#39;s the perfect balance. You get a little rebalance. Look, China wants to move to a consumption-led economy by 2030. That is an explicit government mandate. They want to move to 70% consumption just like the rest of the developed world. We want to increase our manufacturing percentage. we we&#39;re already at that level of consumption. So, this rebalance is natural and it makes sense. I&#39;m very interested in what they&#39;re talking about as it relates to the currency kind of kind of lowering the value of the US dollar because that also helps alleviate some of the imbalances. There were rumblings earlier in the year. Remember the Mara Lago accord where they&#39;d have a a a summit like they had in the in the mid 80s where they de you know devalued the dollar. I don&#39;t know that that&#39;s going to be part of it per se, but I think that&#39;s the trend. We&#39;re going to get a counter trend bounce here in the dollar because everyone&#39;s bearish on the dollar now after everyone was bullish. And then we&#39;re probably going to continue lower which is going to be great for S&amp;P earnings which is going to help rebalance the trade and we&#39;re going to be okay. What could go wrong you like you sound like everything is perfect, Tom? Well, look, I look at businesses company by company. We did a client conference call April 7th, okay? And I went through every single company. And I went through their balance sheet, their liquidity, their cash flow, their revenues, and all of these things were going up. The only thing that had changed is the\n\nSo like washing machines, whirlpool, the price went up like literally shortterm for a matter of months. 2 years later, the price per unit was actually lower.

And I went through every single company. And I went through their balance sheet, their liquidity, their cash flow, their revenues, and all of these things were going up. The only thing that had changed is the headlines\n\n### HEADLINES_AND_NEWS\n\nthe valuation of equal weight relative to cap weight is one standard deviation below the mean. Your money is going to be made finding those things that have been hit hardest by tariffs. Worst case scenario, no longer worst case scenario. these things can double over the next two, three, four years. Okay. Yeah. \n### MEDIA_APPEARANCE_RECAP\nI want to get your take on this tax bill, right? Um and the way that I&#39;ve been sort of thinking about it is that if this didn&#39;t happen, it would be a big problem for the markets. Yeah. It happening doesn&#39;t seem to necessarily be a big catalyst because it&#39;s expected or what do you think would be in there that would that could move the needle more? I think it will move the needle once it&#39;s done. It&#39;s going to be pushed through with record like yes they got well relief corporate tax rates earning the impact on earnings power the impact on the consumer having more money. Uh so this is well but they they&#39;re not going to have more money than they do now. Right. Waitresses are look uh no tax on tips. You you got corporate tax rate. You&#39;ve got um we we&#39;re basically shifting now from the apocalypse into growth and deregulation. Growth and deregulation is the happy place. Okay. So, welcome to the happy place. We&#39;re now focused on growth. Companies can start to invest. The tax bill is one more uh cherry on the on the cake. Uh and and this is going to be the second half theme. So, when Trump says stocks are going a lot higher, first off, his first tweet was right, okay, on April 9th. His second tweet last week when people were nervous before the UK deal was right. Yesterday, he&#39;s in Saudi Arabia saying stocks are going a lot higher. Um th this is one of the few regions of the world right now that has an explicit growth program on the plate. Deregulation, tax cuts, billions upon billions, trillions of dollars investment in the United States incentivized for these businesses going that&#39;s going to create a huge amount of jobs. And if you remember Trump 1.0, guys who run money like me, we did okay. It was a good four years, a lot of volatility. We ended up fine. Okay. everyday people, middle-class working pa class people. If you look at the employment rate, real word wages, they did better than ever. And I think you&#39;re going to see that cubed in this Trump 2.0. I think you&#39;re going to see the middle class, the upper middle class, the lower class, working class do exceptionally well. I think, by the way, it&#39;s interesting. I think you&#39;re going to see a continued outperformance of international stocks even despite all of this growth programs. US stocks are going to do great. International stocks are going to start to do well. It&#39;s it&#39;s a cycle that happens every 10 to 15 years. We started it in the first quarter of this year.\n### MEDIA_APPEARANCE_RECAP\nWhen volatility ticks up you buy CBOE that&#39;s a no-brainer. Uh volatility huge crush in the last four weeks. Uh so their revenues are going to be a little bit lighter. Double downgrade it&#39;s a little aggressive. It&#39;s such a great business. It&#39;s got kind of a monopoly in the space. So, I think longterm it&#39;s okay. I think short short term I actually like the sellside call, which I don&#39;t say very often. Oh, interesting. Okay. Um, and then also we&#39;re looking at New Holdings. That&#39;s the holding company for New Bank. Um, and watching that stock. It&#39;s a Brazilian digital lender here. Um, and uh, it posted a slight miss in its adjusted profit for the first quarter. The company did see strong revenue growth of 40% year-over-year during the quarter, but higher spending on new clients dragged on its profit. The shares were down before. Now they&#39;ve turned higher by a little more than 1%. It&#39;s among the most valuable lenders in Latin America. Warren Buffett&#39;s Birkshire Hathaway is among its shareholders. That&#39;s usually Tom&#39;s mood music uh when he hears that kind of thing. Um we&#39;ve talked to the company before and it really has seen big growth. We also recently talked to Marcato Libre, another fintech and e-commerce company that&#39;s big in Latin America and the theme that they emphasize over and over again is just adoption. In other words, they&#39;re much, you know, they&#39;re not as far along as we are here in the US with everyone on devices, shopping, banking online, and so there&#39;s a lot of upside. Yeah. Well, uh, I got rich investing in South American banks is something no one&#39;s ever said. I I will say this, look, they&#39;re growing customers. They&#39;ve got a new technology. Buffett owns like a sliver. One of his underlings bought it. Uh, but as far as it goes, what you saw was their credit reserves went up in terms of uh expecting bad losses. And this is the same story over and over in Latin America. Brazil hasn&#39;t benefited from the international outperformance because of the political climate. So you really need to see a change in political regime. They&#39;re expanding into Colombia. That&#39;s weighing on cost. They&#39;re expanding into Mexico. So they have to invest a lot. This thing has been kind of dead money for years. Everyone said, &quot;Well, Buffett bought it. It&#39;s going to be great.&quot; Well, Buffett didn&#39;t buy it. His his underlings did. And um I I it wouldn&#39;t surprise me if they do get the growth, if they get the momentum, if all the ingredients come together. Uh but it&#39;s not there yet. So, for me, it&#39;s a pass. Okay. I mean, it&#39;s the stock hasn&#39;t I don&#39;t know. I guess it has. It is. It had a big run up and now it hasn&#39;t. That&#39;s why we&#39;re talking about it. Yeah, I guess so. Um, and let&#39;s talk about Uber offering a billion dollars of exchangeable notes tied to shares of self-driving truck company Aurora. Aurora was Aurora was one of the first autonomous vehicle startups to go public, a listing it achieved in 2021. Uber was the company and is the company&#39;s largest shareholder. Couldn&#39;t sell its shares for four years. Aurora is a really interesting company. We actually had the chance to talk to the C CEO recently. Um, and to be clear, Aurora doesn&#39;t make the cars, the vehicles. It doesn&#39;t even make cars at all. Its software is for self-driving semi-truckss. And it actually is one of the first ones that h actually has um trucks using its software on the roads in Texas. So, that was a big milestone for the company. Uber still owns over 300 million shares of it, 23% of the stock. But what you get is when you get a convertible offering, it can dilute the value for existing shareholders. But still, Aurora kind of an intriguing, you know, we keep talking about Tesla, Whimo, D. I mean, this company, it software is already driving out there. I think this offering is just a way for Uber to raise a billion dollars of cash without selling the stock. Uh, and Aurora doesn&#39;t want to them to dump a billion dollars of stock on the market. So, uh, this is a great way. It converts at a at a 10 to 15% up, uh, into Aurora stock. So that means that stock or into cash. So that means that stock would be pulled away from Uber. So this is, you know, it&#39;s a way for them to monetize that position without destroying the market for Aurora and maintaining that partnership. So I think it&#39;s a smart move by Uber. I think uh Aurora likes it and uh and it&#39;s a bet that this could be the future because we we do need truck drivers and we do need that uh logistics. Are you invested in any kind of autonomous driving? Is that a theme that you&#39;re into? I know you&#39;re sort of more on the value side, so I don&#39;t know if this appeals to you. I think the greatest international value in AI right now and one of our largest positions is called Alibaba. No one wants it. Yeah. No one wants it. It&#39;s up. It&#39;s doubled off the lows. People are still not talking about it because the Republican Senate and House is saying we&#39;re going to delist it again. Every two years we&#39;re going to delist it. So we own it in Hong Kong. They&#39;re going to report earnings tomorrow. Okay, you saw JD. Earnings are going to be good. This is the cheapest way to own AI in the world because not only are their models beating Deep Seek and beating Open AI, but they&#39;re the largest cloud provider. And what they say to all these AI startups in China, every single one of them, we&#39;ll help you out. We&#39;ll give you a free sample. We will give you cloud computing which you need and you can&#39;t afford, you will give us equity. So Alibaba is effectively an AI ETF in China. They own a piece of all the AI startups. So that&#39;s the way I&#39;m playing it. So indirectly, I probably have a lot of autonomous driving, but I have it through something with a huge margin of safety, $80 billion of cash on the balance sheet, generating $20 billion of free cash flow, buying in stock like there&#39;s no no tomorrow, and a leader in AI. So, oh, and by the way, they&#39;re the number one retailer to the middle class. So, as the Chinese push, a little bonus, they&#39;re a toll taker. Um, that was an very adept piv pivot, Tom Hayes, try from autonomous driving Alibaba. stock is up almost 60% over the last year.\n### HEADLINES_AND_NEWS\nlet&#39;s get to some breaking news that was crossing the wire. A wave of deals being announced amid President Trump&#39;s visit to the Middle East. This time it&#39;s Boeing. President Trump saying Boeing has won its largest ever order in the company&#39;s history. Qatar Airways said to have purchased 160 aircraft from the US company. Um, and um, again, Trump saying that this is the total the largest Boeing order in its history. Of course, there&#39;s other some other plane\n\n called Alibaba. No one wants it. Yeah. No one wants it. It's up. It's doubled off the lows. People are still not talking about it because the Republican Senate and House is saying we're going to delist it again. Every two years we're going to delist it. So we own it in Hong Kong. They're going to report earnings tomorrow. Okay, you saw JD. Earnings are going to be good.

So that's the way I'm playing it.

Um, that was an very adept piv pivot, Tom Hayes, try from autonomous driving Alibaba. stock is up almost 60% over the last year. So, not too shabby on that front either. Um, let's get to some breaking news that was crossing the wire. A wave of deals being announced amid President Trump's visit to the Middle East. This time it's Boeing. President Trump saying Boeing has won its largest ever order in the company's history. Qatar Airways said to have purchased 160 aircraft from the US company. Um, and um, again, Trump saying that this is the total the largest Boeing order in its history. Of course, there's other some other plane\n### HEADLINES_AND_NEWS\n\n### HEADLINES_AND_NEWS\n\nthat the president made with a Qatari plane, but we&#39;ll leave that aside for the moment as that country gives him a plane. Um, but um, Tom, Boeing is a company you own. Yeah. Company you like. This is a big one. Okay. We owned it around $150. It dropped down to $129 with all the tariff barriers and all everything else. We bought it like the lights were going out. I mean, we have because here&#39;s the thing. We bet on jockeyies. So, they call me turnaround Tom. I like to buy great businesses when they&#39;re temporarily marked down. Kelly Ortberg ran Rockwell Collins. Okay. Defense contractor 7 years forbagger for owners. He&#39;s actually an engineer on the floor. So it&#39;s it&#39;s nice to have Boeing run by a guy who actually goes on the floor and knows how planes are put together versus a salesman when the doors fall off mid-flight. That doesn&#39;t work. Okay. So Kelly is going to turn the business around. He&#39;s already done that. The stock is 129 four weeks ago. It&#39;s 200 today. They just got a huge order. This is icing on the cake. This guy can deliver. They&#39;ll sell some of the space business and at at the uh at the margins, but they operate in a duopoly. It&#39;s like it was hysterical when the Chinese said, &quot;We&#39;re not going to take your planes during the tariffs.&quot; China needs Boeing&#39;s plane like a diabetic needs insulin. Okay? I mean, they can they can go to Airbus and Airbus will say, &quot;We&#39;re so happy to have you as a new client. Uh your weight is 21 years. Uh how many would you like?&quot; And and so now as soon as this was done, China went back to Boeing and said, &quot;Can we get back in line?&quot; And Boeing said, &quot;Yeah, we&#39;ll open the door. We like you as a customer.&quot; So China&#39;s back in the game. Saudi Arabia&#39;s back in the game, and they&#39;re going to build the planes better than they&#39;ve ever built them because Kelly Orberg actually understands the business. Okay. Well, hope I hope that&#39;s so for all of our stakes who fly on Boeings. Tom Hayes is going to stick around with me. We&#39;re going to have more on President Trump&#39;s deals from the Middle East coming. And he wants to ask you a question as well. So Muhammad, what do you see as the magnitude of the the amount of data center centers relative to the rest of the world? Uh and and how are they cooling them? Uh is it is a key question in the Middle East uh moving forward? What what do you see as as the future? Is it going to be the data center hub of the world or is it just going to be a major player along alongside the US and and other nations? Excellent question. I would say I would say the United States and China the Gulf is clearly emerging as this third feeder of AI power. They are willing to be to invest heavily in AI infrastructure of energy abundant energy to fuel the AI ecosystem is the main center uh decisive factor here and this is where the Gulf is finding its own niche. So if that&#39;s true, then effectively the the two winners by default have to be the UA, the the uh the Middle East and the United States because we have effectively unlimited access to energy and uh and natural gas being the derivative play to to see that in the first stages. Is that a fair way to think about it? I think it&#39;s a very fair way to think about that. I think the Gulf countries have been investing heavily in building the electricity grids around this sort of major hypers scale AI infrastructure. I agree with you the United States is a clearly ahead in the AI race. who owns solar and and other types of renewable um generation here. And the the changing sort of Tom Hay still with me obviously the changing um face of what energy generation looks like in the United States has been really interesting as we&#39;ve seen it powered by this data center boom. Yeah, I think NRG is interesting. It&#39;s a great business. You&#39;ve seen the stock go up quite a bit. But the problem is they rely on the kindness of strangers. They have to go to the regulators every year and beg them for price increases. That&#39;s the bad news. They&#39;ve got to make all this investment in the face of not knowing what those price increases are going to be. However, they&#39;re going to they&#39;re going to boom from this. They&#39;re going to continue to boom, but that the run is already priced in a lot of that good news. Yes. But the difference with the rates is when they make those sort of out of, you know, they make the side deals with the data center operators like we&#39;ve seen to some extent, right? Microsoft made the deal to reopen the reactor at three mile island. you know, so I think that&#39;s what they and investors are banking on. I think so. I&#39;d rather play the feed stock. I always try to play the arms dealers, not the waring factions. So for me, I&#39;d rather play natural gas companies that have been left for dead like comtock resources. Jerry Jones owns 71% of the stock. They&#39;ve got the Hannesville shale. And by the way, not only are you going to benefit from the unlimited demand from the data centers and from the utilities for that natural gas, but guess what the EU trade deals are going to all all be about with the tariffs is all going to be you take our natural gas, we will lower your tariffs. They&#39;re in the Hannesville shale, which is right right there where they can ship. So, uh so that&#39;s a good way to play. We started coming out on that aggressively at $8 and $9. It&#39;s $23. We think it can double again from here. Why is that? Well, uh, they have to report to the SEC, uh, all energy companies, PV10, proven reserve for 10 years. What they don&#39;t report is they&#39;ve got 15 excess years of drilling that&#39;s not in the price of the stock, which is probably double plus from here. So, we think this has a long runway driven by the AI theme. So, when people say, &quot;What are your AI investments?&quot; I say, &quot;Well, Alibaba is a derivative play.&quot; And I say, &quot;Comm stock resources.&quot; And people say, &quot;What do you mean?&quot; I said, &quot;Natural gas.&quot; And that&#39;s the story. And NRG is going to be an equal beneficiary for sure. Right. Interesting. Thanks, Tom. Appreciate it. Well, all your markets action straight ahead. Stay tuned. You&#39;re watching [Music] Catalysts about how this would all play out, this impact of tariffs. Yeah. And if we&#39;re going to get more inventory, there&#39;s going to be more markdowns, which is disinflationary along with gas, which means it could be true that Powell is too late. He&#39;s 150 basis points too restrictive. He&#39;s got to go in June. Maybe. Maybe maybe lots of unknowns. I like how you made this about pal. Look, you got to look through one and two quarters. This is a short-term bottleneck. AEO is a random an anecdote. Uh I think I think well but it&#39;s not the only anecdote. There are a lot of other retailers where we&#39;re seeing similar we&#39;re seeing a huge divergence between hard data and soft data. Okay. So on balance when we look at retail sales, consumers are saying the world is ending. They&#39;re depressed. Okay. But they&#39;re outspending like there&#39;s no tomorrow. If you look at the if you look at the actual data, so you have an AEO. Could it be their mix was off? You know, I&#39;m I&#39;m saying on balance, I agree with what you&#39;re saying. Could their merchandise not have been exactly what consumers wanted? And they even admitted that they got a got it a little bit wrong in this quarter. Yeah. Lulu had the wrong color a couple quarters ago and everyone said, &quot;I can&#39;t wear yoga pants that are off green.&quot; You know, I mean, I only wear purple yoga pants personally, but uh but I you know, you look at the market&#39;s a discounting mechanism. So it&#39;s it a lot of these consumer discretionary stocks when you look at the positioning relative to defensive it&#39;s at record lows people this is known right so this is it looking in the rearview mirror when we look through the front window and we look at a better uh tariff climate when we look at consumer confidence coming back soft data to start to meet the hard data I think you&#39;re going to see a boom especially the wealth effect with the stock market back up is a very very constructive thing for the consumer they don&#39;t have to worry to look out for Yeah. So, you&#39;ll be buying plenty of purple yoga plants. That&#39;s right. Thank you. Um, of course you&#39;re going to stick around. We got Yeah, it it seems like international you you want two things in play. Number one is a weaker dollar. So, that&#39;s helped. I think uh XUS relative to the US is outperformance of some 15 16% year to date. So now people, this was a big theme for us coming into this year. How do you see that playing out in coming years? Because if you look at, you know, zoom out and look at the long-term data, these run in normal 10 to 15 year cycles and we&#39;ve had this zero interest rate policy. So large cap tech has outperformed the la post great financial crisis. That&#39;s over. We&#39;re we&#39;re in kind of a normalized interest rate environment. So do you see that as a favorable environment for the next handful of years for international relative to the US or are you still king US equities? I mean I I think there&#39;s a place for both. Just want to get some uh final thoughts from Thomas on the US dollar and this after there was a story today um that Bloomberg reported that the US and South Korean in their Korea in their discussions over trade had brought up currency as a possible lever. We did see the dollar pull back particularly against the South Korean Juan on this. There&#39;s a lot of debate over whether a weaker US dollar is a good thing or not. Uh it&#39;s going to help earnings in the back half of this year for sure. that&#39;s already happened. The dollar&#39;s been weakening. We&#39;re going to get a counter trend bounce because everyone&#39;s bearish on the dollar right now. Uh, however, the Chinese were pretty smart about this tariff negotiation because what they effectively did was they devalued the yuan by 20% ahead of talks. So, it&#39;s like, okay, you want to do 20% tariffs, we&#39;re kind of flat. It&#39;s fine. Uh, so I I I think you&#39;re going to see a trend. Uh, there has been a a theme earlier in the year. There were rumblings about the Mara Lago accord where they would devalue the dollar to balance out trade. Uh, I think you&#39;re going to see some pockets of this. I think the trend for the dollar moving forward is going to be a little bit lower in the coming years. That&#39;s going to help uh S&amp;P earnings. That&#39;s going to help our trade rebalancing and it&#39;s going to be a positive thing all around. We&#39;ll see. Tom, thanks so much for being here. Appreciate it. That does it for Catalyst coming up. And we&#39;re back. And then uh the three segments, the panel, you can listen to the full one on YouTube or again Stephen spent all weekend cutting these up to just get the the points where I was talking about value versus growth. This is important concept and context to understand moving forward. If you want to listen to the whole thing, go to yach uh YouTube uh put in the search bar hedge fund tips. By the way, while you&#39;re at hedge funtips.com, click on terms. This is all opinion, not advice. Um, so we&#39;ll listen in here. Value growth. What&#39;s the best way to play this recovery routine? Uh, first quarter we saw value outperform growth by 12%. Year-to date it&#39;s only 3%. So tech has made a comeback. Uh, I like to zoom out and take a longer term view. Since 1927, if you had invested in value over growth, you&#39;ve outperformed by 4.4%. Uh, that&#39;s not over that period. That&#39;s per every single year. What does that mean in terms of excess returns? It means that million dollars you put in in 1927, you got 68 million more by being invested in value over growth. Now, recency bias, the last 15 years, growth has outperformed value. Why? Growth always outperforms value when you have interest rates in the 1 to 2% range. when you&#39;re in three 3% and above, value outperforms by 76% of the time. And in the years that value outperforms growth, on average, it&#39;s by 15% per year. So if you look at someone like Warren Buffett, who&#39;s outperformed the S&amp;P 500 by double, basically 9% uh over six decades, the reason is only 3% of his ideas made up most of the returns. What he did was he avoided the massive growth drawdowns like the tech wreck, like the nifty50, like the growth manas. And by avoiding the mistakes is how he put himself in position to outperform. There was an article in the Wall Street Journal this week, if he didn&#39;t give so much money away, he would be 87 billion wealthier than Elon Musk. $400 billion from compounding money in boring companies consistently over time throughout cycles. So, uh, I have a view and in a little bit I&#39;m going to tell you how I really feel. Sure. Did that guy retired? Well, look, I I think Boeing has been a no-brainer. That&#39;s been a duopoly. Uh, that thing got down to $129 four weeks ago. We went on Barney and we&#39;re pounding the table. It&#39;s 210 today. Probably going to 250 over the next year, year and a half. I I think, you know, I think people believe that it it&#39;s an eitheror decision. Either I&#39;m a growth guy, either I&#39;m a value guy. They&#39;re they&#39;re attached at the hip. Uh and some of the best value stocks I&#39;ve ever bought traded at PE multiples above 100. And you say, well, how the hell is that possible? Because they&#39;re in trough earning cycle and I play reversion to the mean. So, so you know, earnings might be two cents a share. uh and then when they normalize to $5 a share that multiple comes down to eight. So you have to have kind of a holistic view. Now in terms of growth versus value looking over 100 years you to to you you know you look at a company by company basis you have to say okay how much is priced in okay how much of the good news is already priced in and you know statistically going back a hundred years you have to have the view because so many people are trapped in recency bias of the last 15 years growth has crushed value by by the definition of how like M Msei defines it not like necessarily how you invest in growth or how I invest in value because there&#39;s like a lot of nuance to that. Um, but in terms of cost of capital and what it takes to fund these growth ideas and these startups and when capital becomes available, you saw the VC boom postcoid when money was free, you saw the VC collapse in in 2022. Uh, so I I would just say price is what you pay, value is what you get. uh to take an all-in growth only point of view in this environment with recency bias. Well, that&#39;s what&#39;s worked for the last 15 years. You must you really need to to take you must have an outlook that rates are going back down to zero or 1% or or maybe even 2%. Uh and that might might certainly happen. Okay. Uh but we&#39;re more in the camp of like 3 to four and a half% and odds are 76% of the time we&#39;re going to outperform. Now we&#39;re not just resting on our laurels like buy a value ETF and hope for the best. I do a lot of turnarounds which is different. You know when you buy uh Boeing when it&#39;s dislocated 66% and they operate in a duopoly. You know it&#39;s not a hard decision. You don&#39;t have to sit up at night and say I wonder if Boeing is going to work. I mean you know uh you could go to Airbus and wait 20 years for your next plane. I thought it was hysterical when the Chinese uh pulled their orders from Boeing over tariffs. The Chinese need Boeing planes like a diabetic needs insulin. I mean, it it was just completely hysterical. It&#39;s like, okay, go to Airbus, wait 21 years. Oh, you can go to Comarmac. Uh, good luck flying on those planes. They delivered 13 last year. Uh, you can&#39;t make this stuff up. So, uh, Mike and I, I think, uh, agree on a lot more fronts than than is apparent. uh and we also disagree on some but I have growth stocks as I define in terms of fast earnings growth maybe I&#39;ll pay a lower multiple I believe in the technology story I just I just look at what am I willing to pay for certain aspects of that story uh and I have one of the the cheapest most incredible AI plays uh in the world at a very low price which Mike might might ask me or you might have to stick around till tomorrow to find out I&#39;ll just I&#39;ll interject I don&#39;t I don&#39;t want like everyone&#39;s looking in the space that I&#39;m looking at but we&#39;re looking at it grow because of the recency Yeah. Which mean I know we&#39;ve kind of already talked about one, so I guess besides Boeing, what else your top name? Yeah, I like uh two names that I&#39;ve actually presented at the money show that are up a lot since then. Uh one was Alibaba. So that gets two things going. So to to bet on international, you have to believe that the trend of the dollar in the intermediate term is going lower. You look at the cycles for the last 40 years, it looks a lot like value. If you overlay value growth relative to interest rates, it&#39;s a pretty regular cycle. If you overlay international versus US, uh relative to weak dollar is stronger international. So this gets value and uh international in one package. Alibaba, it is the cheapest way to play AI in the world, trading at 13 times forward earnings. Earnings are underestimated at 12 13 times next year. Um they have the fastest uh models against Deepseek, against OpenAI. that recent data came out this week. Uh they also have a piece of every single effectively every single AI startup in China because they come to them and they say we need compute power. They&#39;re the leader in the cloud business. Uh and they say no problem. We&#39;ll give it to you for free. Oh, by the way, you&#39;re going to give us equity in your business. So there are a lot of thousand baggers in the in that equity that&#39;s not even priced into the stock. Uh Tao and T-Mol, they are a toll taker on the Chinese middle class. They&#39;ve been pumping stimulus for the last nine months. They&#39;re going to do more now that the tariff thing is over. Um, revenues were up 12% year-on-year. This is a monster business. 40% of Chinese e-commerce goes through Alibaba. It&#39;s a play, a leverage play on that recovery. Their international iss growing at 20%. They&#39;ve got 60 some odd billion dollars in net cash. They bought 5% of the float in in the last 12 months. So, uh, that&#39;s one I like. And then there&#39;s one that I talked about on on this stage then when it was uh uh I mean we initiated our position at $5. I think we talked about it on stage at seven or eight dollars. It&#39;s called Cooper Standard. Uh this is an auto supply company. They do the rubber ceilings around the doors and windows. Uh and they do fluid transfer systems. It is a leverage play on the recovery of US AutoSAR. Trump has in the tax bill. He&#39;s going to try to make interest rates uh car loans taxdeductible. Whether that goes through or not, the average car on the road is 13.5 years. You don&#39;t want to play the waring factions GM and Ford because it&#39;s going to be a race to the bh bottom in terms of incentives and volumes in terms of margin compression. You want to play the arms dealers, the auto parts suppliers that have been left for dead in the last two years when SAR got down to 152. Uh this has been a fiveagger for us. We think it&#39;s going to double again from here and probably more than that if they get up to normalized $7 uh a share of earnings, which they did at the last SAR peak in 2017. So, those are my two picks. If you had come to past money shows, you&#39;ve made a lot of money. Boeing&#39;s up 60% year to date, give or take. Uh and, uh and it&#39;s going a lot higher. So, um that&#39;s what we like. And by the way, to speak about uh Buffett, yes, Apple has uh done a huge amount of his returns, but his entry point in 2016, it was trading about 14 times earnings, and he benefited from multiple expansion, buybacks, and all that stuff. So, he bought a great quality business at a reasonable price. And that&#39;s where we agree it&#39;s like price relative to earnings growth. uh um and um uh I I just think it&#39;s a very exciting time right now to to be in equity markets and and to participate because uh I think I think Trump is right. He was right about the bottom of the market on April 9th when he put out that tweet now&#39;s the time to buy stocks and I think he was right last week when he said America&#39;s going to boom. I should have asked you this, John. Actually, the Baba Bada Cooper, what&#39;s the ticker again? Uh CPS Cooper&#39;s name. Let me put a caveat on Baba. We&#39;ve switched all of our Baba Holdings into Hong Kong Holdings. So, if you have like Interactive Brokers, you can call your brokerage and just swap them out. It&#39;s an 8 to1 exchange rate because the currency rate is is fixed. Uh that&#39;s a hedge because they were throwing that out there in the negotiations with China, the dlisting. They already went through the PCAOB two years ago, but as a fiduciary just to manage that risk, why take the risk if you don&#39;t have to? We own it in Hong Kong under ticker 9988. We do have a bunch of US derivatives which were just willing to assume that quote unquote D-listing risk. I&#39;d assign maybe less than 15% probability, but it&#39;s not nothing. Rick Scott is kind of interested in that and the new SEC chair is interested in that. Um the only one that that would torch if they do that and it&#39;s not polit politically feasible if they delicit they torch $800 billion of US investor capital. The Chinese don&#39;t care. They&#39;d be laughing all the way to the bank. It&#39;s like we don&#39;t own US ADRs so have at it. think about yeah I I would just add one thing there&#39;s the the massive trend the parabolic move is in no marktomarket so why this has all grown so much whether private equity whether private credit is because the pensions can come in and and they all get to keep their jobs because in stocks it goes like this but it trends up if you got got the right stocks with private credit you get no marks until you get one mark down to zero and they collect fees holding it up to this level even if there&#39;s deterioration under the surface. So, uh, I kind of like to have mark tomarkets because then you can see problems before they show up before you get the full mark to market and you&#39;re out. So, I agree with Louis. If I had to think about something that would worry me, that would be the pocket that would that would be of concern. So to the condensed version and we&#39;re back and then uh this was my first keynote uh on Saturday talking about market outlook second half and three ways to play the housing recovery and why the housing recovery is actually going to happen which is non consensus.

How&#39;s everyone doing? Have you enjoyed the week so far? Yes. Good. Uh anyone have a favorite uh speaker or section so far they want to share? Favorite part of the week? Tom Lee. Tom Lee. Yeah, I like Tom a lot. He&#39;s he&#39;s great great. Anyone else favorite section? Nobody said the water reception. All right, we have a lot to cover in a short amount of time, so let&#39;s get to it. Uh Mike covered most of my background. I have my own firm, Great Hill Capital. It&#39;s based in New York City. Uh prior to that, who saw the big short movie? Okay. I worked for the guy played by Brad Pitt. He is four times more intelligent than Brad Pitt and half as handsome. Let&#39;s just leave it there. Um, prior to that, I was with a firm called Bedford Oak Adviserss. The principal was friends with Buffett for 40 years. Uh, we would go out to Omaha every single year and uh, see the wizard uh, which was absolutely amazing. So, I grew up in the New York value mafia going to idea lunches with Mario Gabelli, Lee Coopermanman, uh, and people who underwrite securities as if they were going to write buy the entire business. When they buy one share, they think about, would I be willing to buy the whole company? And that&#39;s kind of the framework that I live. When I buy a share of stock, it&#39;s not that the price goes up. It&#39;s predominantly if JP Morgan was going to give me unlimited financing to debt financing to buy the whole business with the one catch, I was the equity and it had to be 100% of my net worth. So, if it worked out, I would make huge amounts of money on on my wealth. If it didn&#39;t work out, JP Morgan gets the business and I&#39;m completely wiped. And unless that I pass that filter with a yes, I don&#39;t buy one single share because as Buffett said, rule number one, don&#39;t lose money. Rule number two, don&#39;t forget rule number one. Okay. The other thing I did at Bedford Oak Advisors, I was placed as COO of a public company we had. My job was to go out and find an asset management business to buy. So I interviewed over a hundred different asset managers. I saw every single strategy under the sun. Growth, value, momentum, fixed income. And I saw what was durable, what worked, what outperformed over time, and what was fad and flash in the pan and blew up and etc. So that shaped my philosophy just learning from hundreds of years of others experience of what worked, what didn&#39;t, and what was durable. Uh we run a long short equity strategy in separately managed account format for accredited investors and qualified institutions. And we do have the number one ranked podcast in the hedge fund category named hedge fund tips with Tom Hayes. Uh we give ideas, we answer\n\nour core philosophy is from Warren Buffett and that is great investment opportunities come around when excellent companies are surrounded by unusual circumstances that cause the stock to be misappraised. And I&#39;m going to be giving you three what we feel are aggressively misappraised stocks today. We love misappraised stocks. Okay. Um so we profit buying on weakness and selling on strength. This is driven by deep research and the belief that the greater price dislocation reduces risk. What do most people say when the price goes down? Don&#39;t buy it. It&#39;s risky. Okay. Okay. And actually, the lower it goes, if it&#39;s a durable business with cash flows and a stable balance sheet, the risk is actually coming out because you&#39;re buying that stream of future cash flows at a lower price. Okay? Sometime, you know, when they come down a lot, it&#39;s because it had been priced for perfection. And you heard a lot of different names this week where they&#39;re kind of pricing in excessive expectations about what&#39;s going to happen in the next 5 to 10 years. stocks trading at 100 times sales, stocks trading at 50 times earnings.\n\nWe go through the balance sheet, income statement, cash flow. We really do a a good enough analysis that you can make a decision whether it it warrants doing further work or you can just take a pass. Uh our core philosophy is from Warren Buffett and that is great investment opportunities come around when excellent companies are surrounded by unusual circumstances that cause the stock to be misappraised. And I&#39;m going to be giving you three what we feel are aggressively misappraised stocks today. We love misappraised stocks. Okay. Um so we profit buying on weakness and selling on strength. This is driven by deep research and the belief that the greater price dislocation reduces risk. What do most people say when the price goes down? Don&#39;t buy it. It&#39;s risky. Okay. Okay. And actually, the lower it goes, if it&#39;s a durable business with cash flows and a stable balance sheet, the risk is actually coming out because you&#39;re buying that stream of future cash flows at a lower price. Okay? Sometime, you know, when they come down a lot, it&#39;s because it had been priced for perfection. And you heard a lot of different names this week where they&#39;re kind of pricing in excessive expectations about what&#39;s going to happen in the next 5 to 10 years. stocks trading at 100 times sales, stocks trading at 50 times earnings. And what I found from living through many cycles, and I&#39;m a little older than I look, is that often times those companies do fulfill the incredibly amazing promises. The problem is is at the point at which you bought it, when it washeadlines  every single day, the market had already priced that in. So you&#39;re late to the party. So then if it&#39;s even 1% below excessively high expectations, the stock can fall 50%. And that&#39;s why you you need to be pretty careful. Uh the other thing I see is people who buy those high flyers and get it right and they keep going uh not on the basis of any underlying fundamentals. It&#39;s gambling and they give it back to the casino sooner or later because they&#39;re like, &quot;Wow, I was so brilliant. That went up 5x. I just bought it when it was high and it went higher and all these suckers came in after me. I&#39;m going to do it again. And then maybe they get lucky again because you&#39;re in a bull market. We&#39;re all smart in a bull market, right? Uh and then that third one just completely cleans their clock because there was no framework. There was no sound fundamental framework that they could lean on uh to to outperform. Okay. Now, since we do turnarounds, when a stock falls 50, 60, 70, 80%. The market&#39;s telling you something. In most cases, in many cases, that stock deserves to be down. And the market is telling you that that business may cease to exist. Okay? So, it&#39;s not just buying stocks that are down because the price is down. It&#39;s buying down because it&#39;s a temporary impairment. And that&#39;s why we tend to favor businesses that have been around for many years, if not decades, and we&#39;ve seen how they operate through cycles. And we&#39;ve determined whether or not that moat is durable. Is it a fad or is this a secular grower that every handful of years, you know, you go to a recession or you go to a sector trough and they always come out of it because there&#39;s no real competition. Those are the type of businesses that we love. So, first thing you need to do if you&#39;re buying stocks that are down a lot is uh and I know this is foreign because everyone today this weekend talked to you about buying stocks that are already up a lot is do can they meet their upcoming debt obligations? Do they have enough free cash flow to service the debt? When is the maturity of those debt instruments? Okay. And if you can get comfort that look, they&#39;ve got three, four years of runway, they&#39;re going to figure it out. they&#39;re going to turn around or the cycle itself is going to take care of it. Uh then you&#39;re golden. Next is is the moat durable? Does the company have a sustainable competitive advantage? And do they have a history of performing well through through economic cycles? So I don&#39;t like one that&#39;s hasn&#39;t been through any real tests. That worries me because uh I I don&#39;t know what&#39;s going to happen. I like just seeing ones that have a natural rhythm. I can see the trends of the free cash flow over time. I can see the trends of the revenue over time. I can see the trends of the earnings over time. I can see the balance sheet over time. I can see the share count over time. Uh and that leads to the next one which is management. Do they prioritize shareholder value? Uh are their incentives aligned with shareholders? Are they issuing themselves a ton of stock and diluting me, making my uh uh slice in the pie smaller at their own benefit, or do they respect equity? Are they buying shares in? Is the share count going down? Is my slice of the pie getting bigger without putting more money into the investment? That&#39;s the type of management I like. They respect equity. They&#39;re not doing equity offerings and diluting people and screwing your position for their own benefit because all they care about is their salary. And that&#39;s very common in the smaller stocks, in the promoted stocks, in the high-flying stocks. You have to be careful. And then\n\n### MISCELLANEOUS\nnesses that we love. So, first thing you need to do if you&#39;re buying stocks that are down a lot is uh and I know this is foreign because everyone today this weekend talked to you about buying stocks that are already up a lot is do can they meet their upcoming debt obligations?

And that&#39;s very common in the smaller stocks, in the promoted stocks, in the high-flying stocks. You have to be careful. And then finally , is there a near-term catalyst, a significant catalyst that could unlock value? I like to bet on jockeyies. I like to have a turnaround CEO who has a past track track record of success. Um, they could spin off divisions. They could sell non-core assets to raise cash and pay down debt to give them three years of runway to turn around. These are critically important for turnaround situations. Uh, which we just absolutely love to do because you can with regularity double and triple and quadruple your money in great businesses in a reasonable time horizon of two, three, four years and make a significant IRRa. So, we&#39;re effectively underwriting public securities where most people just get hypnotized by the price movements in the short term as if we were buying the whole business. So like private equity in the public markets type of framework analysis. Okay, here. So what&#39;s our edge? Okay, anyone can buy cheap stocks. Every time you purchase a stock, someone else is selling. And you know the funny part is you both think you&#39;re smart. Okay, so we believe we have two key advantages. First and foremost, our time horizon. We take a longer term view. Most people are thinking in days, weeks, and months. We&#39;re thinking in years. Our average holding period is 12 uh 12 12 months up to five years. Some double and triple much faster than we expect. Some take a little bit longer. Um but over a portfolio of 8 to 12 stocks, we run a concentrated portfolio. Uh there have been very few people to ever outperform with more than 15 stocks. Um so that&#39;s how we run it and we take patience and we do we don&#39;t use leverage. So, we&#39;re not getting margin calls. We&#39;re not getting stopped out. We&#39;re not getting uh uh phased out by short-term\n\n### MISCELLANEOUS\nfinally , is there a near-term catalyst, a significant catalyst that could unlock value? I like to bet on jockeyies.

And\n\n---\n\nfinally\n\n### MEDIA_APPEARANCE_RECAP\nfinally\n\ntheme entering 2025 last we anticipated a big rotation coming into 2025. Uh you can go back to our podcast if you go to youtube.com type in hedge fund tips with Tom Hayes. Just pick a date. You can see what we were saying. And our big theme was get out of MAG7. Okay. And we started to do so last summer. Um why? Not because of some technical chart because earnings were decelerating and they were fully priced. Okay, so their earnings growth the last two years have been over 30%. Uh 36% it&#39;s dropping to 16% this year and 18% while the rest of the market the unmagnificent 493 the earnings growth is accelerating. So what would you rather have? A group of stocks whose earnings growth rate is cut in half and the multiple is twice the market or a group of stocks where the earnings growth is accelerating and the multiple on those earnings is below the market. The former or the latter? The latter, right? Okay. More earnings growth, less money. That&#39;s what we did and that&#39;s what you absolutely saw uh the first quarter huge outperformance S&amp;P lags. So you had uh you also had an outperformance both of the unmagnificent 493 to the magnificent 7 and you had a massive outperformance of international over US stocks. Okay. The last time you saw that uh you had a period of seven years of dramatic outperformance. You also saw an outperformance of value versus growth and that&#39;s going to continue. We&#39;ve had a bounce in tech in the last few weeks. Uh our view based on underlying earnings, they can trade to the top of the range, but I think the real money is going to be made under the surface in the unmagnificent 493 in international relative to US and in value relative to growth. And uh that was a very unpopular opinion in the third and fourth quarter. As Rob knows, he&#39;s been listening to the podcast for three years. Give stand up. Give him a hand. Rob has been uh so uh came out to see us. And the other thing you have to keep in mind, and I shared with it yesterday, zero interest rate policy was the exception, not the rule. So the last 15 years, everything that&#39;s worked has been all about growth over value. In a normalized environment, uh, anything when the 10-year yield is over 3%. Value outperforms growth 76% of the time. When the 10-year yield is over 4% like it is right now, value outperforms growth 86% of the time. And as I shared on the panel yesterday, over the last since 1927, basically last h 100red years, value even including the aberration of the last 15 years, value has outperformed growth by 4.4% per year. So if you put in a million in value and a million in growth in 1927, you have 68 million more dollars by having chosen value over growth. And basically it&#39;s because you avoid the huge draw downs like the nifty50 crash in the 70s, like the tech wreck in the 2000s, like the mini tech wreck in 2022. Anyone remember that? Few of you. Okay. Um Okay. So we we&#39;re seeing a record rotation out of US stocks into international. The last time you saw that type of rotation out, huge outperformance for the next seven years. So we&#39;ll get fits and starts here in the beginning. But this is a real trend and this is a function of what you&#39;ll also see is the weakness in the dollar persist in line with this value out outperform growth mag 7 to lag seven. You can see the earnings growth on the chart on the right side from 36% earnings growth last year. The other 493 stocks was only 4%. This year that&#39;s cut in half. So if the earnings growth decelerates cuts in half, does it make sense that the stocks went down? Of course. Okay, that&#39;s the most important thing. And people say all the mag 7 was down because of tariffs. Most of them are actually unaffected by tariffs. Okay, if you look business by business. So it has to do with earnings growth. And what&#39;s happened? The unmagnificent 493 had 4% earnings growth last year. They&#39;re up to 8% this year, 13% next year. So their earnings growth is going up, multiples down, that&#39;s starting to go up, etc. So you want to skate to where the puck is going, not the ones that are in the headline that have already gone up 5x that people are saying now is the time to buy. The ones that no one&#39;s paying attention to. The best example of that this year was Boeing. No one talked about Boeing. No one wanted to touch Boeing at 12 four or five weeks ago was $129. I mean, we couldn&#39;t buy it fast enough. I mean, we did a special call with clients. We said, &#39;We haven&#39;t asked you to send in money since October 2022. Okay, that was the bottom of the tech wreck when you couldn&#39;t give away tech stocks. And for those of you who think I only buy boring old manufacturing businesses, you know what we were buying handover fist in October 2022 when no one wanted it? This little company called Amazon. Okay. When you it was it was marked down 50%, you couldn&#39;t give it away. Another company called Alphabet Google. Okay. So, I&#39;m pro tech at the right price in the right way. Uh and we got out of those last summer. Uh and um so, you know, and they basically done nothing ever since with with the recent draw down.\n### HEADLINES_AND_NEWS\nNow, here&#39;s the new theme. This is what you guys have been waiting for. We&#39;ve gone from conceptual to pragmatic. Here&#39;s something that you will never hear outside this room. Second half US housing revival. Okay, this is the farthest thing from truth. Uh they continue to underperform with sentiment at multi-year lows. We we see this as overdone with several catalysts ahead. Lower rates. You&#39;re like, how are we going to get lower rates? We just had a credit downgrade last night. Who saw that? Okay. Uh people were asking me what&#39;s going to happen Monday morning. I was like, I don&#39;t know. All I know is the businesses in my portfolio, their free cash flow is going to be the same. Their revenues is are going to be the same. Their earnings power is going to be the same. Uh so I don&#39;t I don&#39;t spend a lot of time on that. Uh and what we&#39;ve seen in the past the last two times kind of like you get a little dip and then it&#39;s fine. So we view this as a long-term opportunity and highlight three picks picks and shovel plays to express the theme. Why aren&#39;t we just buying home builders if we&#39;re so excited about this theme? Uh, we like to buy the arms dealers, not the waring factions. The waring factions beat themselves up. As this thesis plays out, you&#39;re going to see a massive volume of new starter homes produced, which is going to create excess supply, the exact opposite of what we have right now, which is a der of supply. And you&#39;re going to see incentives, you&#39;re going to see margin compression, you&#39;re going to see big volume. And we&#39;re going to talk about how do we get to that position. So at the current pace of construction, it would take seven and a half years to close the multi-million dollar home deficit, which is about four or five million homes. Um decade plus of underbuilding has pushed the median age of owner occupied homes to 41 years from 31 in 20 uh 2005. 48% of the new housing stock dates back to of the US housing stock dates back to the 1980s or earlier. So, we have an old housing stock. We have a limited housing stock and uh we need to build four to seven million homes very very quickly. So, how how&#39;s that going to happen? First off, mortgage rates are easing. Okay, so they peaked at seven and change. They&#39;re now down, you know, six and a half or so, but the uh 7.79, highest in 23 years. Today, they&#39;re at 6.76. And they&#39;ve been rangebound between six and a half and seven for the past six months. Now, um part of that is people are stuck in low mortgages. That&#39;s affecting supply. Uh when rates approach 6% in late 2024, we saw 18 consecutive weeks of positive purchase applications. Okay, so now we&#39;ve come back up. So, how do we get mortgage rates down? Well, Secretary Bashan, our Treasury Secretary, made it clear. Okay, he his objective is to lower the 10-year yield. What are mortgage rates priced off of? It&#39;s not priced off the Fed funds rate. It&#39;s priced off the 10-year yield because it&#39;s a longer duration loan. And how he&#39;s going to do that is he&#39;s going to exempt governmentbacked securities from the SLR. And he believes that will lower the 10-year yield by 30 to 70 basis points. And we expect this to happen in the second half of the year. So, if you take the 10-year yield down 30 to 70 basis points, which would basically be 375 to 350, you get a 30-year fixed mortgage. I know this is going to blow your mind, uh, below 6%. And if you get a 30-year fixed mortgage at five and change in the next 12 months, the demand for housing is going to be something like we have never seen in our lifetimes because everyone has been priced out. Everyone&#39;s been waiting. And then you couple that with you&#39;re going to start to see an increase of supply. 1982 40% of the new homes were entry level under,400 square foot house. Uh by 2023 that dropped to 9%. And how are they going to get more supply? Those colored areas on the map are federal lands that there&#39;s currently no construction on. Trump is going to open up a portion of those lands to construct starter homes. So you get your 1500 foot house from KB Homes with your 5.9% mortgage and an endangered elk in your backyard free of charge. Okay. It&#39;s going to be awesome. Um, so he&#39;s also cut red tape. That&#39;s a top priority under this administration. He&#39;s terminated the AFFH rule. He&#39;s restored local control and removed local zoning tax. In 2022, 83% of uh delays were attributed to permitting issues. They are going to destroy the red tape and make it easier and easier for companies to build, to buy land, and to build quickly. The administration is focused on another key solution. Opening portions of the 640 million acres of federal land for large-scale housing development. Roughly 47 million acres where 7.3% of federal land fall within metropolitan areas. Everyone thinks it&#39;s only in the middle of nowhere. Uh where more housing is needing needed. And the AEI estimates that if we just unlock, forget 640 million acres, if we just unlock 512,000 acres in the metro areas and outside areas, that could support the construction of 3 million new homes. Okay. Now, if you&#39;re going to build three million new homes, uh demographics, you know about the millennials, they all need houses. They&#39;re all starting families. We won&#39;t go into that.\n### FEATURED_COMPANY_DEEP_DIVES\nHere&#39;s pick number one, QXO. This is a Brad Jacobs company. Does anyone know who Brad Jacobs is? Okay. He one guy, the guy who listens to my podcast, uh too, uh he wrote a book, How to make a few billion dollars. He&#39;s made about12 billion and he&#39;s made a lot more for shareholders. He&#39;s starting this QXO. He&#39;s going to roll up building supply companies because he sees this opportunity. Uh we built a position at $13 and change. It&#39;s like 16 now. Over the next five to seven years, we believe this stock goes well above 50, probably 80 to $100. Uh he did XPO logistics and he did United Rentals. Did everyone know United Rentals and Equipment Leasing? Both of those were rollups. If you put a million bucks in United Rentals, you made over 50 million bucks over 20 years. If you put a million in XPO over 10 years, you made about 60 million. Okay, that&#39;s enough to get that coffee going, that caffeine going. Ladies and gentlemen, he&#39;s going to do it again. And by the way, he put 150 million when he did of his own money in XPO. He&#39;s put a billion dollars of his own money in QXO. So, he&#39;s putting his money where his mouth is. He sees this trend. He aims to do 10% of any given industry. It&#39;s an $800 billion industry. 80 billion topline, 10% IBIDA margins. That&#39;s eight billion dollars. You put a 12 10 12 times multiple, you have, you know, conservatively five six bagger, but we think it could be closer to, you know, $100 stock. I think uh that&#39;s that&#39;s how we&#39;re underwriting it. Right now, Beacon is their platform company. It&#39;s a roofing company they just bought. So, they&#39;re in business. Now, they&#39;ll roll up all different types of um arms dealers to the home builders, all types of building supply companies over the next five years. This is one you buy, you tuck away. Not for five minutes, not for five months, five years. Huge multiple on your money. We like it. Second one is Stanley Black &amp; Decker. If you&#39;re going to build houses, what do you need? Tools. They own DeWalt. They own Craftsman. They own Stanley. This one got crushed by COVID over inventoried, inflation, etc. What I can tell you is they&#39;ve taken out the last two years almost $2 billion of business uh of cost.$2 two billion dollars of costs, which equates to about uh it&#39;s about $13 per share on $154 million shares just on the cost savings as they normalize margins. Uh we think that&#39;s worth $200. It&#39;s trading at $71 right now. It&#39;s not going to do it in three months. It&#39;s going to do it in three years as the cycle turns. The operating leverage in this business is insane. When construction volumes go up and and construction turns the corner, this is the business to play because this business has been around since 1843. It&#39;s been through a couple cycles, ladies and gentlemen. 1843. You think it&#39;s going to make it through, you know, made it through the Great Depression, made it through the Great Financial Crisis. You think it&#39;s going to make it through Trump? of course he&#39;s going to make it through Trump because he&#39;s going to make everyone build houses and bring the houses down and and uh bring the cost down, etc. So, we love this play. Uh we think management has done a good job executing in really hard conditions. We love that they they&#39;ve delevered the balance sheet, taken the costs out. So, and we&#39;re seeing now the business inflect revenues start to reacelerate. Margins starting to reacelerate. The last time they got margins to this level, the stock traded at $150 a share. Okay. And the final one is GenerRack, the Kleenex of home standby generators. Okay. No, we&#39;re not going to cure cancer today. We&#39;re not going to guess who&#39;s going to win the AI race, but we&#39;re going to keep your power on so you can run your AI queries through uh Alibaba&#39;s Quinn 2.4 large language model. Uh you can use open AI, too. But uh we&#39;re going to talk about uh a special international play in the breakout room. Uh what is that in 15 minutes, Mike? Yeah, you&#39;re okay. So, you&#39;re gonna like that. The theme of that room is called How the Uninvestable Became Investable. We&#39;re going to talk about some quote unquote currently uninvestable stocks and the actions we took in previous uninvestable stocks and what happened. Okay. Uh so GenerRack is a huge play on the home building. All I can tell you about this one and this is really what I do. I like to look at divergences between price and cash flow because the only reason you give $1 of your money into any business is you expect to get more than $1 back. So if they&#39;re not generating any cash, then your only hope is that another sucker comes behind you and pays more. And that&#39;s nothing more than a hope. And where you can really get hurt is if that hope comes true because as I said at the beginning of the presentation is the gamblers tend to give the money back to the casino. So when you get the high flyers right and you double your money quickly and you don&#39;t know how it happened oftentimes you wind up saying I&#39;m so smart and going into the next thing that you don&#39;t understand and uh and getting hurt. So with this you can see what&#39;s happened. You can see why the price dropped 80%. You see those red bars on the top? That&#39;s negative free cash flow. People were worried about solveny risk. Look what&#39;s happened since they&#39;ve cut cost, increased margin, and the cycles come back. Free cash flow&#39;s gone up. And what hasn&#39;t gone up yet that&#39;s starting to inflect is price. And if you can find businesses where there&#39;s a divergence between either a price has gone up too high and cash flow is negative, that could be a short or price hasn&#39;t gone back up but cash flow has recovered. When they turn, it turns all at once and you make many multiples very very quickly. Uh this is going to be a triple over the next few years. This is another leverage play on the housing recovery inherent demand. So, uh, three super boring plays with super exciting outcomes if you have the patience and you sit tight and watch this play out over the next few years.

So,\n### ASK_ME_ANYTHING_QA\nwith that said , I think we&#39;ve got it all. That&#39;s how you can reach me and we&#39;ll take one question or two. Yeah. Building. Yeah, I love it. Owen&#39;s in the house. Yeah, exactly. I think it would be great. Uh I haven&#39;t looked at the underlying fundamentals and and price and all that stuff, but I think anything in that sector, I like the way you&#39;re thinking. Absolutely. Yeah. And by the way, and and the other thing I would think about these type of stocks, when you have a stock like Gener that&#39;s down 75%. Okay. Um, if it goes $5 against you tomorrow, just log in, look at the free cash flow and say, &quot;Ah, in the short term, the market is a voting machine based on emotion. That&#39;s where you get $5 moves.&quot; And you say, &quot;Am I wrong? What does everyone else know?&quot; Nothing. It could be a hedge fund blowing up. It could be a short attack. It could be nothing. Just look at the underlying business. Like if you were going to buy a jersey Mike&#39;s down the street and the guy said, &quot;How much do you want for your business?&quot; you say, &quot;Well, why don&#39;t you show me your books first, and if you&#39;re profitable, I&#39;ll make you an offer.&quot; You know, people do that in normal business. They don&#39;t do it in the stock market. And if you just apply that framework, uh, I think you&#39;re going to see massive success in your investing future.

And the reason it&#39;s great on YouTube is because I go through 10 20 uh what do we do like 50 pages of data charts, fundamental stuff, macroeconomic stuff every single week. So, if you can see the charts when I&#39;m talking about demographics, if you can see the charts when I&#39;m talking about earnings, it&#39;s it&#39;s helpful. If you listen, it&#39;s great, too. I know people like to exercise and walk around while they do podcast, but you&#39;ll get significantly more value doing it that way. Welcome. Um, we&#39;ll talk about this. I can&#39;t overemphasize these four points and I know I did it in the previous presentation but owing Corning the only thing I have to look at is the balance sheet. So how much cash do they have? How much debt do they have? What&#39;s their free cash flow to service that interest payment? And when do the different debt maturities come due? And if you can get comfortable like by with that you see the free cash flow trends are pretty stable then yeah it&#39;s a home run. You might even buy a few more shares at that level as well.

So, I'll get like 10 to 12 different companies per week and I'll pull up the chart. I pull up the balance sheet. I pull up the income statement. I pull up the cash flow statement. And we go through it step by step. And I say, \"That's a great question. Here's why I would definitely look deeper at this because this is a great idea. Here's why I would pass.\" And I do like in the last half hour, I do like 10 12 of those very, very quickly. Um, well, actually, not very quickly. Sometimes it runs for like a long time. Uh, so that would be a great place. Send that in. So you will be the number one\n\nmanagement is imperative. Uh we have a company called which we&#39;re not going to talk about today which now we are because you guys stayed the extra hour called VF Corp. Anyone familiar with VF Corp? They&#39;ve been around since 189 something 93 95 125 years. What they have a DNA for doing is buying and selling brands. Okay. So right now the brands in their stable are Northbased, Timberland, Vans, okay, a company called Vans. And Vans has gotten hit extremely hard because they oversupplied during COVID. It was super popular. Everyone bought three pairs of Vans, very similar to Nike with the Air Force Ones. Uh, and then and the Air Jordans. And then it went through three years of decline. They brought in a new CEO. His name is Bracken Daryl. And the thing you need to know about Bracken Daryl, and I&#39;m trying to emphasize this point about management. Bracken Daryl has a background at Proctor and Gamble, at Old Spice. He&#39;s a brand manager. He&#39;s exceptional at it. He came into a little company called Logitech. Okay. And this is the cancer curing products that they made at Logitech. Okay. Complete commodity product. Nothing revolutionary about a mouse or a webcam. He came in when the stock was down 82% just like he came in at BF Corp with the stock down 82%. Uh in the next 10 years it was a 28 bagger. A million dollars became $28 million selling this that you could get anywhere. Why is that a Logitech? Okay. Because he understood branding. He understood operations. He understood supply chain management. He&#39;s a winner. You want to bet on the jockey. So you may say, &quot;Oh, Vans will never come back.&quot; Bracken will bring it back. He&#39;s he&#39;s worked through the channels. Now he&#39;s going to ramp it up. He&#39;s going to start bringing in the creators and the the influencers and the the whole marketing plan. You&#39;re going to see massive action. Northace is a recovery on China. It&#39;s doing well. Timberlin the same thing. So this is the type of bet. So when you&#39;re buying a stock down and what did he do? He sold off Supreme for over a billion dollars to pay down debt to delever the balance sheet. Why? To get multi-year runway to run the turnaround plan and not get stopped out in the meantime. So that&#39;s the type of things that we like to look at. So near-term catalyst, etc. Um, the key with these is the temperament. So, I&#39;m known as Turnaround Tom because I like to buy good businesses when they&#39;re marked down. Uh, but you have to have a certain level of ice in your veins. So, like I I keep going with the the nickname that people gave me, but they&#39;re starting to give me the Iceman name, okay? because they&#39;ve seen me with, you know, stocks down and I&#39;m like, &quot;Yeah, what&#39;s the problem?&quot; People like, &quot;Are you sure we should own this?&quot; And then like four months later, you know, we were buying Vornnado uh during the mini banking crisis. What was that? March of 2023 and they were throwing banks baby out when um Silicon National Bank collapsed and they were throwing out everything with the bathwater. The the last thing you could talk to people about buying is an office read. Okay? I mean, but what did we do? We saw the dislocation and we picked the highest quality business in the most dislocated market. So, if office was going to be destroyed, which there was a compelling case for that to be to happen, which by the way it hasn&#39;t, which was the camp we were in, but we had to assume that it was going to happen, that we weren&#39;t smarter than 99% of the people that said office was over. Who would be left standing? There would be some offices left and what would be left would be the highest quality in the basket and that&#39;s what Hornado owned in New York, all the best locations, etc. And then I could bet on the jockey, Steve Roth, multi-billionaire. Uh, everyone I spoke to that knew him said the same thing. The guy&#39;s like 80. He will not die until his stock is back at all-time highs. I can assure you that. And that&#39;s what I got from and I met this guy uh in 2010 at an idea launch and this guy was no nonsense. You you have to know who you&#39;re betting on is what I&#39;m saying. You need a good quality business, a stable balance sheet to get through the downturn and a good jockey to turn it around. Okay? And the temperament to wait it out. And this temperament comes also. How many of you trade on or invest on margin or leverage? Yeah. So that&#39;s where you get stopped out because if you if you if if a stock is temporarily down 20% against you, you might be down 40%. And you might not be you might have relinquished the decision to someone else called a margin clerk as to whether or not you could continue to have ICE in your veins and stick it through until Bracken Works turns your million bucks into 28 million bucks with nothing break through here at all. or if the margin clerk takes your money and sells your shares down 40% to a guy like me who&#39;s sitting in cash waiting for this for the shares. Okay? So, you want to be on my side of the table, not that side. And the way you guarantee that is very low to zero margin. If you buy these stocks, right, you will make more than enough money. You don&#39;t have to get people who get hurt are people who try to get rich too fast. Okay? When you slow it down and the older you get, I know I look young, the longer my time horizon is, and the wealthier I&#39;ve become. When I was young, I wanted to be on margin. I wanted to get rich and make a million bucks in a week. If I just buy these uh zero day options and the market goes up 5%, I can make up, you know, 10 million, whatever. and you wind up wiped out. And most people don&#39;t make it through that and they&#39;re they&#39;re out. And if they just understood the right principles at the beginning, buy great businesses when they&#39;re at good prices and wait and don&#39;t be on margin. Don&#39;t give your decision to wait to the margin clerk who&#39;s going to make it the decision for you. Small portion that&#39;s okay. Even Charlie liked a little bit of leverage. So, uh, Charlie Munger that is. So, that&#39;s that. That&#39;s temperament. What does uninvestable mean? The term uninvestable is music to our ears. It tells us that an asset or market has become perceived as so uncertain, so risky, and fearful that it&#39;s easier to slap the label uninvestable on it, regardless of the fundamentals or valuation. That&#39;s critical. That&#39;s why Jeff put it in a different color font. Okay. regardless of the fundamentals or valuation just to avoid the scrutiny,\n\nIf you buy these stocks, right, you will make more than enough money.

Okay. regardless of the fundamentals or valuation just to avoid the scrutiny, headlines\n\ncareer risk of going against the crowd. So most people are structured, most active managers are what we call closet indexers. Their whole job is to collect assets and stay in business. Because if they collect assets and stay in business, they have an annuity that goes up over time in perpetuity because what happens? the market goes up over time in perpetuity. So if they can if they don&#39;t zigg too far from consensus and it they have a downyear, they get to keep their job because they didn&#39;t do worse by taking an unconventional bet. You as individual investors don&#39;t have those constraints on you. You can buy and underwrite an individual business like we talked about in the main room and you don&#39;t have to worry about the short-term volatility, the short-term marktomarket, uh the job risk that some of the managers uh closet indexers have and why they stick. So what closet indexing means is that they hug very closely to the index that they&#39;re measured against. So most managers are measured against the S&amp;P. You&#39;ll notice that the top five weights of the X and S&amp;P are X, Y, and Z, MAG 7 mostly. You&#39;ll notice that most active managers have the same stocks. Okay? So, you&#39;re just paying more fees for effectively the same outcome. Um, so we we run things very differently, very similar to how Warren Buffett managed money for outside clients before he rolled it into the public company and had different types of constraints. So he was doing a lot more turnarounds, a lot more quick doubles and triples in his private partnerships than he was able to do in the big because once he got the insurance float, he had too much money to put to work that he couldn&#39;t be quite as nimble two, three years. He was more interested in 10 years or forever if he could do it because that insurance float just kept coming in and coming in and coming in. Okay. Um different asset classes and sectors have been deemed uninvestable many times throughout market history. financials after the great financial crisis. What was the best trade you could have possibly made after the March 2009 lows? You know, financials, City Bank, Bank of America, JP Morgan, etc. Uh they were completely quote uninvestable. People kept waiting for the retest of the lows, etc. Uh tech stocks following the dot crash and energy during the pandemic. Does anyone remember when energy prices went negative? In theory, they would pay you to take oil from them. Okay? You can&#39;t make this stuff up. Uh so we&#39;ll tell you what we did during that. Uh uninvestable is often profitable. Taking the opposite side of most crowded trades historically has generated excess returns averaging 7 to 19% annually over periods ranging from 8 to 22 years. Since 1994, Morning Stars unloved sectors, those with the most outflows in the prior years. Remember in the previous presentation I talked about the last shall be first. That was our theme going into this year. The LA the worst performing last year international uh non-magnificent seven uh value going into this year. Those were our themes and those have been the big big outperformers this year. Okay. So with this uh Morning Stars quote unquote unloved sectors returned 10.96 annually nearly doubling the 5.57% from the quote loved sectors i.e. the ones that had the most inflows in the year before. Okay. It&#39;s it&#39;s just human nature to want to chase what&#39;s already worked because you feel like it&#39s safe. It&#39;s already working. Uh it&#39;s not risky. But actually those are the riskiest things unfortunately and that&#39;s why you see this divergence of underperformance. So we look back here to uh 200 we got here uh basically what is this? It&#39;s a little blurry but this talks about oil relative uh energy stocks versus the rest of the market. Talks about tech stocks versus cash. talks about um energy stocks pre great financial crisis when they were on that run and you can see these extremes always work themselves out. So everyone gets excited. So what what do you think would be most loved right now? I&#39;m asking you. I don&#39;t know the answer to this question. What do you guys think everyone&#39;s super excited about? Go ahead. Semiconductors. Okay. Yeah. Certainly last year and Nvidia peaked at uh June 20th. I remember because we wrote an article on June 20th. You can check hedge funips.com. And the thumbnail of the article was a picture of Jensen Wong signing a fan&#39;s brazier and I knew that was the short-term top. Uh I&#39;ve been to this movie a few times and the stock has actually not made new highs since that point. It may go on to make it but that&#39;s almost a year of dead money and it had quite a big draw down maybe 40% from that point at one at one point 35 40%. Okay. So, semiconductors, anything else people are super excited about? AI. Yeah, a lot of hype in AI. And I think all that stuff is going to come true. The question is on a company by company basis, are you already paying for the best case scenario if everything they say comes true is already going to be true? If you&#39;re paying a hundred times sales for a stock, you know, that&#39;s pretty amazing. I if if you went to buy the local car wash and the seller is like, &quot;Uh, yeah, I&#39;ll sell the business to you.&quot; And you&#39;re like, &quot;Okay, what did you do last year?&quot; And he&#39;s like, &quot;Well, we did, you know, we did about a million dollars, about 80,000 a month.&quot; And he&#39;s like, &quot;All right, that&#39;s pretty good.&quot; You&#39;re thinking, &quot;All right, what did you earn?&quot; Well, we earned about $300,000 on that million dollars of sales. That&#39;s pretty good business. You know, you might offer him one and a half million, two million bucks. But he comes back and he says, &quot;Uh, yeah, we&#39;re going to grow like crazy. We&#39;re going to buy up every single thing. Uh, we want a hundred million for that $300,000 of earnings power.&quot; And you may say, &quot;Yeah, this guy&#39;s pretty charismatic. He could probably buy 10 more. Maybe he&#39;ll buy 20 more.&quot; Uh, but if you pay a hundred million, I guarantee you you&#39;re already paying for the best case scenario. So, if he only buys two more car washes, you&#39;re going to lose an awful lot of money if you pay him a hundred million. And you probably lose half your money even if he does buy every other car wash that he&#39;s talking about. And that&#39;s what you have to be careful of. You know, when God was Does anyone know what FOMO is? fear of missing out. So, I think it&#39;s genetic and and I think when God was handing out FOMO genes, he passed up Tom Hayes, okay? Because, you know, people I mean people I got rich on Bitcoin, I&#39;m so happy for you. That&#39;s great. It&#39;s outside of my lane. It&#39;s not what I do, okay? Uh I got rich on Nvidia. Congratulations. I&#39;m so happy for you. It&#39;s outside of my lane. I just like these double, triple, quadruples. great businesses. I can sleep at night. Boeing at $130. Disney at $85. I don&#39;t need to think about these things. I don&#39;t need to stay up at night staring at the ceiling. Is Disney gonna stay in business? Okay. In the way it works in America is if you don&#39;t bring your children to Disneyland at least or world at least two or three times, child services comes to your house. They take your children and they take them away and they give them to new parents and they lock you up for being an abusive parent because you haven&#39;t taken your children to Disneyland. And that&#39;s never going to change. Okay. Uh the parks, the the cruises, they&#39;ve got 180 million sub uh streamers, which is half of what Netflix has. Netflix has like three times the valuation. Oh, and by the way, we got the parks, we got the cruises, we&#39;ve got the ESPN growing like wildfire. So things like that.\n\nI got rich on Bitcoin, I'm so happy for you. That's great.

It had been the worst performing sector of 2019. Lowest S&P waiting on record at 3.5%. Highest short interest in nearly 20 years and it was trading at less than half the market multiple. If you want to talk about uninvestable and career risk, if you were a pension manager, if you were a money manager running money for pensions and you owned an energy stock in 2020, you were probably getting a pink slip because it was all about renewables. It was all all about we&#39;re going to, you know, uh, put up all these wind turbines and solar panels and all this fantasy land stuff, which is great. We need all of it and we need more than ever, natural gas, uh, etc. But it had gotten so extreme and the boat had shifted so far and we said, you know, this is a problem. Uh, but how do we benefit from this without taking abnormal risk? And what I thought about was one, I thought it was ridiculous that we weren&#39;t going to need energy for the next decade or two decades. I mean, you had to buy some of the story. It was so pronounced. It was so strong. The sentiment was so uniformly convinced that we were not going to use oil anymore and we were all going to be in electric vehicles. And I said, &quot;What if they&#39;re right, how do I participate and still make money?&quot; And I said, &quot;Let&#39;s just buy the one that will be left standing if they&#39;re right about everything. One of them is going to be left standing in the tradition in the transition. Let&#39;s buy Exxon Mobile at $33 a share. Paying a dividend. World is shut down. Not a complicated decision because if Exxon goes, I have a lot more to worry about than my stock portfolio because if we&#39;re not pumping energy and we&#39;re not keeping the lights on and uh people have stopped moving, you know, last thing I&#39;m going to be worried about is my stock portfolio. So, yeah. That&#39;s a good question. I don&#39;t Six or seven. You remember in the 40s? Yeah. Six or seven in the You bought it in the 40s. Yeah. So, it must have been eight. So, there was a real risk they were going to cut the dividend and I fully accepted that. I mean, any stock that drops that much. I&#39;m not buying for the dividend. I&#39;m buying for the turnaround. Every now and then, they keep the dividend. Like, uh, we didn&#39;t have time to talk uh Jeff had noted 4.4% 4% dividend yield on Stanley Black &amp; Decker right now and the stock is down 80% 80%. So might they cut it? Yeah. But the fact that they&#39;ve taken almost $2 billion of cost out of the business and the revenues are starting to reacelerate. You probably get that lock it in. They keep growing the dividend over time. They&#39;ve cut it a little bit. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So um Yeah. So what was it at peak, right? Like 8% or something. Yeah. When the stock had dropped. So that happens in those situations. But once the business stabilize, what do they start doing? Increasing the dividend again. So on your basis, it starts to really compound. I mean, Buffett gets annual dividends close to the total amount of basis he invested in Coca-Cola in 1989. It&#39;s unreal. And it keeps growing every single year with ah adjusted. It&#39;s It&#39;s complicated, but cheaper than now. I&#39;ll put it that way. Um, okay. So, that was Exxon, and we didn&#39;t get the the exact bottom. I think the bottom was $25. Um, we got it 33 blended, and we didn&#39;t get the top. Uh, I think we sold it below 100. It&#39;s now 105. But, you know, it wasn&#39;t a 10bagger. It wasn&#39;t Nvidia making 50 times your money. that was like you don&#39;t have to think hard about. Another one we did during the uh COVID was Wells Fargo. Wells Fargo three times in history it traded below 50% of tangible book. Okay, we built a huge position at $2510. And if the world was going to end, our view was that probably JP Morgan, probably Wells Fargo and and possibly Bank of America would be left standing. Okay. Uh, so JP Morgan didn&#39;t come come down enough that we felt like we were getting paid for the amount of risk we were taking. Wells Fargo came down enough that we&#39;re like, &quot;Yeah, this this is not going to be hard.&quot; And it went up to the high 50s very very quickly, got out at 57 and that that&#39;s that. But we didn&#39;t have to think hard about that because if Wells Fargo ceased to exist, you know, I like to say that the end of the world only comes once. Uh and if it&#39;s now, don&#39;t worry about your stocks. Uh and if uh if Wells Fargo cease to exist, that would be as as close to the end of the world as you could get. So that was a no-brainer. Yeah. Uh we hold stocks between 12 one year and five years, but I&#39;d say three years is kind of the average uh turnaround period. Yeah. Some go super fast like Monado was a quick double. That was one of the few that did it in less than a year and that was frustrating because we had to pay taxes, but it wasn&#39;t something that was a hold forever stock and we&#39;re like, you know what, take the win and move on. But usually it&#39;s going to take well more than 12 months. So, we&#39;re we&#39;re comfortable to like Cooper Standard, we started building at $5 and change in May of 2022. Uh that&#39;s now a five bagger off those, but we&#39;re three years in and we don&#39;t even think the story&#39;s begun. We think it&#39;s going to double again from here. So, that&#39;s going to take probably five years till we&#39;re fully out or, you know, getting out. But the return on capital is insane. So we&#39;re always looking at the tradeoff for internal rate of return has to be in excess of what we&#39;re measured against. Uh so if that time creeps too long and it starts to impact our IR that&#39;s something we we&#39;re cognizant of and by the same token if the IRRa is insane in a short period of time we have to harvest some of that. Um it&#39;s a balancing act. It&#39;s uh they were asking earlier what&#39;s going to happen to analysts with AI and I said you know the mediocre ones are going to be toast but that type of analysis like it can be done by machines but there&#39;s so much nuance. I remember when I worked at Cornwall and I&#39;d like I&#39;d sit down with them and I&#39;d pitch him on an idea and my pitch would be like I don&#39;t know five minutes and then the guy who was played by Brad Pitt in the movie he would start asking me\n\n### MISCELLANEOUS\nif it&#39;s now, don&#39;t worry about your stocks.

Two things people think about Tom Hayes. Number one, they think I&#39;m a permable because they know me publicly since it&#39;s been time to be a permable. Uh and number two, they think I hate tech and I only buy factories and boring businesses. Uh and the answer is it couldn&#39;t be farther from the truth. I buy what&#39;s on sale that&#39;s high quality when it&#39;s on sale. And in this recent tech pullback, I would call it a pullback for Mag 7. The reason I didn&#39;t jump all over if if you had put a gun to my head in early April when we were buying a ton of stocks, um I think I even mentioned on the podcast like I could see a scenario where Mag 7 really moves. I don&#39;t think the underlying earnings power prospectively because the amount of capex they have and how that&#39;s going to crowd out buybacks uh is going to justify them trading above the top of the range. So on that basis for me to take that risk for only 30 to 40% quick return is not worth it. Like if something can&#39;t be a double or triple or quadruple in a reasonable amount of time, you know, handful of years or much less, I&#39;m not allocating a dollar of capital because I think in any investment there there&#39;s things you can know and there&#39;s things that you don&#39;t know that you don&#39;t know and maybe can&#39;t know. How many of you knew United Healthcare was committing Medicare fraud? If they were, we don&#39;t know yet. You&#39;re going to stick around and find out. I mean, if you&#39;re holding the stock and you&#39;re like, &quot;Well, I&#39;ll bet they didn&#39;t commit fraud and the DOJ is just going on a fishing expedition.&quot; It&#39;s like, &quot;That&#39;s kind of gambling.&quot; You know, I had clients ask me because I like to buy stocks. I was like, &quot;Under $200 a share? I might be willing to assume that gambling risk, but uh not yet.&quot; that could be a quick recovery. Uh but that goes in my two too hard box like I how can I have an edge? So the point I&#39;m making in that context is that&#39;s why you know our highest conviction idea is not 100% of the portfolio. Now we&#39;re concentrated 8 10 12 stocks uh but we accept the risk that any one of those stock so when I size positions here&#39;s another filter besides owning the entire business is if this position went to zero would they take me out on a stretcher and if the answer is yes the sizing is too large and I&#39;m I&#39;m being a cowboy so I&#39;ll never take that risk if The answer is no. The other nine positions in the portfolio are all going to be doubles and triples. If this goes to zero, it doesn&#39;t matter. I&#39;ll still outperform. Then the answer is yes. You&#39;re sizing it correctly. And you have to go into that assumption in every single investment that there could be things that you don&#39;t know that you don&#39;t know. UNH is a monstrous business. This is not some shy, you know, insurance agent on the corner selling away some policy that they shouldn&#39;t have sold. This is like serious stuff and you have to have that assumption. So if everyone is crowding into one stock and you&#39;re like, &quot;Oh, if I just buy you that stock,&quot; that&#39;s how you really get hurt. So you even no matter how good your research is, no matter how high your conviction, no matter how high the margin of safety is in the business, there can always be a risk that you don&#39;t know that you don&#39;t know. And there&#39;s no way you could possibly know. No matter how good you&#39;re you are as an analyst, it&#39;s just a black swan. think they&#39;re in the Dow. Sorry. Might get kicked out. Uh I don&#39;t know. But if they did get kicked out, it would take a while. And those stocks have a tendency to outperform in the next 12 months. So that would probably be a trigger for me to take a closer look. I got to be honest with you. Um so 2022 marked the third worst year ever for tech. Only behind the dot crash and the great financial crisis. Nearly 2.5 trillion in market value was wiped out and tech layoffs at their highest level since 2000. The post-pandemic capex and hiring spree in tech was quickly replaced by the fastest Fed tighten tightening cycle since the 1980s ending ZERP zero interest rate policy. And we&#39;ve covered that in my panel on Friday. We covered that a little today. If you are going to be exclusively growth because that&#39;s what&#39;s worked in the last 15 years, you are making an implicit bet that you believe rates are going back down to 2% or 1%. Because historically that is when growth outperforms and you&#39;re like, well, there haven&#39;t been that many periods that rates have been at 1% or 2%. Well, news flash, there haven&#39;t been that many periods where growth has outperformed value. It just happens to be the last 15 years. You know, it&#39;s funny. I talked to a new client. I said, uh, I said, &#39; Let&#39;s turn this around. You want me to grow your money, right? Like, yes. I said, how about if we did an exercise and you came to me and you said, Tom, I&#39;ve got $10 million. I want to see how quickly you can lose it in 24 months. I&#39;d say, no problem. Here&#39;s how you do it. All you have to do is buy a basket of 20 stocks trading at 10 times sales or greater and making no money. And I guarantee you&#39;re going to lose 90% of your money in the next 24 months except the last 15 years. That basket of stocks has outperformed the S&amp;P 500. Every other 10-year period before ZERP, you were guaranteed to lose 90% of your money. That was like a no-brainer. And now that&#39;s all anyone&#39;s excited to buy. Ria, an RAIA usually is doing like estate planning. They&#39;re doing uh when are you going to retire? What you know planning goals for your kids. I come from a hedge fund manager background. So we run the same strategies. Uh concentrated portfolio 85 90% 8 to 10 to 12 stocks. 10 to 15% is in a derivative overlay for excess returns without drawing major leverage. And we also use that bucket for hedging and dampening volatility from time to time when we think the market is dramatically overvalued but there are no companies that we&#39;re ready to harvest yet. We&#39;ll use that to to do some hedging as well. Okay. Um so we saw the panic as a generational okay post pandemic capex hiring spree. We saw that as a generational buy opportunity picking up Amazon during its worst year since 20 2000 and Google after both were cut in half that year. This was Google and Amazon cut in half. now um and investors puked in the hole and you couldn&#39;t give away a tech stock because what free money all the VC money crowded in in 2021 uh chasing ridiculous ideas and ridiculous deals that weren&#39;t making money as you got forced liquidations and the business plans didn&#39;t play out. These were a source of funds for many private investors. Those were a double in about a year and a half. Both stocks are essentially flat since we exited. Okay. Now, the most uninvestable opportunity ever is China. And uh this is one of the category that takes longer than expected. This has not been a vornnado. Okay? This has been a multi-year thing. We started in the hundreds uh and we bought all the way down to the 60s. And that was a scary day. I remember because it went to 59. Rob probably remembers it. Remembers the podcast. Rob&#39;s been listening to the podcast for three plus years. Jeff probably remembers it. Um and we brought our basis across all accounts down to $82 and change. And um and the reason we were able to do that is because no leverage. No one took the decision out of our hands as it was collapsing because Xihinping was soldering people into their homes in their apartments so they couldn&#39;t leave their apartments during COVID. I mean, but they were still generating $20 billion of free cash flow. Had eight billion $80 billion of cash on their balance sheet. So did they have the runway? Yes. effectively no net no net debt because they had $80 billion of cash and I think it was like what $18 billion of debt at the time something like that so they had the runway they still had the growth they still had the free cash flow what they didn&#39;t have was investor flows foreign investor flows they didn&#39;t have uh excitement they didn&#39;t have FOMO but that&#39;s when we like to to buy stocks okay uh you can see all the\n\nng up Amazon during its worst year since 20 2000 and Google after both were cut in half that year. This was Google and Amazon cut in half. now um and investors puked in the hole and you couldn&#39;t give away a tech stock because what free money all the VC money crowded in in 2021 uh chasing ridiculous ideas and ridiculous deals that weren&#39;t making money as you got forced liquidations and the business plans didn&#39;t play out. These were a source of funds for many private investors. Those were a double in about a year and a half. Both stocks are essentially flat since we exited. Okay. Now, the most uninvestable opportunity ever is China. And uh this is one of the category that takes longer than expected. This has not been a vornnado. Okay? This has been a multi-year thing. We started in the hundreds uh and we bought all the way down to the 60s. And that was a scary day. I remember because because they had $80 billion of cash and I think it was like what $18 billion of debt at the time something like that so they had the runway they still had the growth they still had the free cash flow what they didn&#39;t have was investor flows foreign investor flows they didn&#39;t have uh excitement they didn&#39;t have FOMO but that&#39;s when we like to to buy stocks okay uh you can see all the\n### HEADLINES_AND_NEWS\nheadlines  there were 35 35 consecutive 135 weeks of negative\n\n### HEADLINES_AND_NEWS\nheadlines  there were 35 35 consecutive 135 weeks of negative headlines  about China and Alibaba. 135 weeks from one single journalist. Okay. Now, I won&#39;t say anything about this journalist, but I will say it would be the equivalent uh where this where this journalist was from would be the equivalent of having a Palestinian write articles about Israeli breakthrough tech companies. Okay, you&#39;re not going to get a positive article out of this one. And it was just going on and on and on. So, these were uninvestable for nearly four years, three years. And she wasn&#39;t the only one. uh every journalist and every sell side and everyone investor was negative on China. So let&#39;s take a look at perception versus reality. Okay, you know the story about the the the peak is when they canled the ant group IPO. Okay. And Xihinping, not Xihinping. Jackma Ma went into hiding became enemy number one because he spoke poorly about Xihinping. And we had the threats of dlisting the stock in the US. They had to go through the PCAOB report. They passed that with flying colors only to get new\n\n### HEADLINES_AND_NEWS\nheadlines about China and Alibaba. 135 weeks from one single journalist. Okay. Now, I won&#39;t say anything about this journalist, but I will say it would be the equivalent uh where this where this journalist was from would be the equivalent of having a Palestinian write articles about Israeli breakthrough tech companies. Okay, you&#39;re not going to get a positive article out of this one. And it was just going on and on and on. So, these were uninvestable for nearly four years, three years. And she wasn&#39;t the only one. uh every journalist and every sell side and everyone investor was negative on China. So let&#39;s take a look at perception versus reality. Okay, you know the story about the the the peak is when they canled the ant group IPO. Okay. And Xihinping, not Xihinping. Jackma Ma went into hiding became enemy number one because he spoke poorly about Xihinping. And we had the threats of dlisting the stock in the US. They had to go through the PCAOB report. They passed that with flying colors only to get new headlines\n\n### HEADLINES_AND_NEWS\n\n### HEADLINES_AND_NEWS\nduring China negotiations this year about delisting because Rick Scott has a problem with Chinese companies uh because the new SEC chair uh was very tight on votes and Rick Scott said you want my vote you got to look into this. So we switched all our shares from US listings to Hong Kong. I think now that the Chinese negotiations are going well, I think that was a leverage point that they were playing because if they actually delisted US ads, all they heard is US investors. They would torpedo $800 billion of US investors cash, the Chinese don&#39;t get hurt. They don&#39;t own it in they don&#39;t own US ADRs. So, uh, I think it was on purpose with the intent to kind of threaten the Chinese government that if you don&#39;t come to the table, you&#39;re going to lose access to the US capital markets. That that&#39;s my take. That said, I made the move anyway to protect my investors capital. That&#39;s my number one responsibility. We still own derivatives in the US because that&#39;s a risk we&#39;re willing to assume in that 10% bucket. any position we put on um for excess returns uh will accept that risk because the underlying stock position will more than make up for that many full times but we want to keep that expression because we can&#39;t replicate it in Hong Kong. We can replicate the stock position in Hong Kong. So for simplicity sake all this is probably noise. The the odds of them delisting are very low in my opinion but it&#39;s not nothing. So if you want a a more as riskless as you can get while still assuming any risk with investing you can through interactive brokers you can just buy the ticker 9988 instead of buying BABA. Okay. So china&#39;s rapid economic expansion has been driven by increased manufacturing and production while we&#39;re relying on an investment growth model. consumption makes up 55% of GDP in China compared to 70% in wealthier nations. US households consume 12 times the nominal dollar amount of their Chinese counterparts. China&#39;s made boosting domestic consumption a top economic priority in the last 12 months, aiming for 70% by 2035. To put it in perspective, China&#39;s 2024 GDP was $18 trillion with consumption at 55%, which is 10.3 trillion if they grow 5% this year and then slow to 3% annually through 2025, hitting the 70% consumption target would mean 18.5 trillion in annual consumption by 2035. That&#39;s an 8.23 trillion jump. Alibaba has 40% of the Chinese e-commerce market. So this is what we call ladies and gentlemen a toll taker. Okay. The government is now mandated that consumption is their number one priority and Alibaba is going to get a piece of that action that the government&#39;s going to push. Okay. And when the Chinese government makes something their priority, you remember solar panels, you remember EVs, okay, there&#39;s 60% of global EV markets and now it&#39;s consumption. They want to get that 20 trillion of savings circulating in their market so they&#39;re less dependent on exports. On the flip side, the US, you can see it makes perfect sense that we would do a rebalance because we have such a we want to increase our manufacturing. This is the red line. Okay, this is consumption. This is manufacturing in the US. This is consumption in China versus manufacturing. They just want to kind of normalize. Bring this down a little bit. Bring this up a little bit. Bring this up a little bit. Maybe keep this up. Maybe it goes back a little bit. And that&#39;s a natural healthy thing and that&#39;s the purpose of the trade talks. So, uh, politicians will always do the right thing after exhausting all other options and that&#39;s exactly what Xiinping did. uh he ca he did a policy 180 after youth unemployment topped 20 it was actually 25% some say 40% but more than that is when unrest hit the streets and when we saw the data on the number of protests we knew we were at an inflection because either he changed or they would change him and um and he changed and he pivoted and it was done overnight he&#39;s been stimulating ever since the numbers are slowly improveving improving in pits and starts and for Baba they&#39;re improving materially. Even this most recent earnings report I wrote some notes that I left on the other stage but uh you know Taobal and T- mall which is their retail up 12% yearon year. That&#39;s hard when you&#39;re number one in the market to get that level of growth 12%. cloud business number one compute power they&#39;ve got 40% of the cloud market Jeff 36% okay so they&#39;re the number one cloud provider compute uh Beijing&#39;s pivoted from tech crackdowns to open support Jackm&#39;s public return and front row handshake sent a clear message the private sector is back in favor and seen as a key partner in economic in China&#39;s economic future that was not the case when we bought the stock Okay, that&#39;s why we have a blended basis of $82 versus 125 or 130 wherever it is now and going over 200. Plus, Ji Singh uh Xi sees private tech as a key to his 2030 goals to lead in semiconductors, energy, AI. China needs more entrepreneurs on board, calling this the right time for private enterprises to fully display their talents. you know, after 2030, he may go back to being uh unfriendly, but right now he knows in order to stay in power and deliver, he needs to do this. So, China&#39;s stimulus plan targets the 20 trillion in household savings. People have been saving money because they&#39;ve been scared because the policies policies are changing. The consumer is thawing and that money is going to wind up. action plan for boosting consumption includes a 4% budget deficit, moderately loose monetary policy, u reserve ratio requirement cuts, lower rates, trade-in programs, and statebacked stock buying. They&#39;re actually like the Japanese in the market buying stocks to prop up the market right now. And if you want to move the market, what&#39;s the number one stock you want to buy? The heaviest waiting in all the indices, okay? Your Alibabas of the world and your 10 cents of the world. If you move those stocks, you move your market. If you move your market, more FOMO comes in from outside investors. And that&#39;s explicitly what they&#39;re doing. They&#39;re not even hiding it under the table. We are buying stocks. So, do you want to get in front of that freight train or ignore that freight train? Uh, the Japanese did it. You saw what happened to their markets two years ago. Okay. So, you see that they&#39;re running the highest deficit. They&#39;re running their deficit at the highest level in decades. This is deficit spending to spur growth. M2 money supply globally. If you look at the pull up the chart, go to Google when you go home, you&#39;re going to see that it troughed and it&#39;s going straight up again. And all of that increase in money supply, all that stimulative stuff, it&#39;s not coming from the US. We&#39;re cutting spending. It&#39;s coming from China. M2 money supply, that equals liquidity. That means asset prices go up. And it&#39;s all centered in China. So, if you don&#39;t have I understand being nervous about China, but if you don&#39;t have like some exposure, even if you buy an ETF, my uh friend Brendan Ahern runs KB, which is a China ETF. Uh I think 86% of his holdings are held in China. He still has like 14% in the US that he can&#39;t get in China. Uh but for me, this is the best asymmetric reward. And if I&#39;m going to risk a dollar of capital, I need a double plus. And this is this is where you get it. If you own a basket, it&#39;s very hard to get those type of returns. Uh return of foreign capital, foreign inflows remain at historic lows. Very similar to energy in 2020, the waitings of China equities and all the international funds, the flows into the sector. It&#39;s exact. I I I don&#39;t know if this is worse or energy was worse in 2020 because in 2020, the narrative was so clear like windmills and solar panels and like if you use oil, you&#39;re going to hell. I mean that was basically uh permeated everything. I think with China people are just a little nervous until they see some price go up is basically all the analysts. There&#39;s one major sellside bank which I won&#39;t name. They were aggressively aggressively downgrading Alibaba at $60 and they&#39;re now aggressively upgrading it at $125 and change. The consensus price target has gone from like 80 to $175 now. And now there was another firm out on Friday at $190. And when it goes over 200, they&#39;ll all move it up to 250. And that&#39;s that&#39;s how it works. They blow with the wind. Opinion follows trend. Okay. Uh foreign investor exposure to the second world&#39;s second largest economy sits near record lows at 5% down from 14%. Remember where I was talking about the waiting of energy in 2020? It went from 10% down to 3%. That&#39;s usually the low. Okay. When when the weights drop by 66% uh whether it&#39;s a sector within the index or in this case China within the international index, you can see here the extremity of where we are right now. It&#39;s very much like uh you&#39;d have to go back to 2021 to see that. Or you could look at this was a monster rally in Chinese stocks when it bottomed out here like it seems to be bottoming out right now. Yeah. Go ahead. pretty much every red day for two years I bought stock. Oh, we have size limits. So, we&#39;ll never go above like our our biggest position ever. We did that two times. Um we did it with Wells Fargo during the pandemic. We went up to 20%. And that was a quick double and we we did it with Baba and now Cooper Standard because it&#39;s gone up 5x has become a huge part of the portfolios. Huge huge. So we have to we have to constantly assess the current weight as these things go up in price. I mean you know Baba has now moved up from 82 basis to 125 and going. So it&#39;s making up bigger and bigger weights over time. So we have to constantly monitor it. But the answer to your question is I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve ever bought a stock on a green day. Yeah. Yeah. Stopped out in terms of what the risk I&#39;m willing to take. Um All right. So this shows revenues cash flow and these are type of things I like to look at. This is just a page from value line and you can see over time what&#39;s happening to the revenues per share, what&#39;s happening to the cash flow per share, what&#39;s happening to the earnings per share. And what&#39;s interesting is if you actually look at that for good businesses that line tends to be like in a bad period it&#39;ll be flat. In a in normal periods, it goes like this and then stock price goes like this around the actual fundamentals of the business. And what we try to do is we try to buy when price is here, but fundamentals are still here. And we try to sell when price is here and everyone&#39;s excited and there&#39;s\n\n\n### FEATURED_COMPANY_DEEP_DIVES\nwe did it with Wells Fargo during the pandemic. We went up to 20%.

And we try to sell when price is here and everyone&#39;s excited and there&#39;s headlines  and uh people who hated it down here are on stage in the main room loving it up here. You you&#39;ll probably have some people pitching Baba next year at $200. I&#39;ll be if we have a if we have a presentation, if we have a a money show, I would definitely say 18 months from now, there&#39;s going to be a speaker on stage pitching Baba over $200. It will not be me. I&#39;ll be waiting for him to get it over 250 and I will be helping out his audience get as many shares as they like. So, write that down. Put it in your Google calendar. It&#39;s coming to a theater near you. All right, Alibaba, we covered that. All right, I want you to understand this concept is critical. So, we talked about fundamentals versus price. Um, you can buy this stock effectively at 2014 prices. The difference today is that the revenue per share is up, 1100%. The cash flow per share is up 500%, the earnings per share are up 500%. And the stock is effectively flat. The one other stock I can think of that h experienced this type of improved fundamentals with no improvement in price until it all improved at once is Microsoft. Microsoft from 2006 to 2013 they grew revenues by 112%. They grew cash flow per share by almost 200%. And they grew earnings by 120%. The stock did nothing. In the following 10 years, it was up 1500%. And if you look at the fundamentals, everyone says, &quot;Well, Satia, Satia changed the world, blah blah blah.&quot; His improvement in revenue per share, cash flow per share, and earnings per share is not much better than Steve Balmer&#39;s was, except he got multiple expansion, and the stock went up 1500%. And and and that&#39;s what I talk about opinion follows trend. You&#39;re going to see the same thing with Alibaba. You&#39;re going to see the same thing with Cooper. You&#39;re already seeing with Cooper Standard is that when the price goes up a lot, everyone gets excited and they jump on the train. Okay? And the same thing is going to happen. What&#39;s what&#39;s dispondent now? Dispondency turns into euphoria. It&#39;s the extreme. Like Warren Buffett always taught from Ben Graham, the market is a manic depressive. Okay? It&#39;s it&#39;s one day the business is the same. In the short term it&#39;s a voting machine based on emotions. In the long term it&#39;s a weighing machine based on fundamentals. So that manic depressive if you can buy stocks from the market on its depressive days and sell stocks to the market on its euphoria days that&#39;s where you make your bones. Yes ma&#39;am. Yeah. Yeah. I I that&#39;s we tend to use that to enhance returns but you have to have a core underlying position as your core position because you can&#39;t be certain about the timing of your view even if it&#39;s a year or two years because look you could have done that in in Microsoft you&#39;re like wow they&#39;ve doubled their revenues they&#39;ve doubled their cash flow and you bought those options in 2014 by 2015 it hadn&#39;t moved and then from 2017 to 2020 you made 15 times your And the options would have been up 50 times. Yeah. But you would have gotten stopped out two or three times before that. That&#39;s why you start with the core position. So as the stock was slowly going up and your options kept expiring, you were making money and you could reload if you wanted to. But if you just do options, right, and you and you get the wrong year or two years, you&#39;re wiped out, right? So you do stock primarily and then add some excess for for some excess returns in the way that you position it based on option pricing volatility and that type of stuff. But your your thinking is correct. But just start with the stock. Don&#39;t try to get rich overnight. Buy the stock. I&#39;m going to own this thing until it reaches intrinsic value. And if you want to add excess returns, do that. Uh I think we&#39;re pretty much uh done. I want to open for one or two\n\nthe market is a manic depressive. Okay?

Uh just to give you an idea, chat GPT is valued at $300 billion in its latest round. Uh that&#39;s the whole market cap of Alibaba. The difference is that Alibaba generated 17.8 billion in net income this year. Uh Open AI is lucky if they do 13 billion of revenues, never mind earnings. Okay, so that&#39;s OpenAI is an example of euphoria. Uh, Alibaba right now is an example still of dispondency. Sell euphoria by dispondency. It&#39;s a good formula. China&#39;s the number one AI global AI play. The most AI you can get for the least amount of money. Their large language models have been proven competitive and better than deepseeek and open AI on many accounts. And for compute, they give all the pretty much every AI startup in China goes through Alibaba, number one cloud player. They say, &quot;We need compute power.&quot; Alibaba says, &quot;No problem. We give it to you for free like every good drug dealer. Give you a free sample.&quot; And then they say, &quot;Just give us equity.&quot; And they have free equity in all the AI startups in China. So it&#39;s almost like an AI ETF by owning Alibaba. Cloud revenue up 18% plus. So all of them are hitting on on uh every cylinders. we like a lot about. You got the e-commerce, you got the uh the cloud compute, you&#39;ve got the AI play, you have uh Tao and T- mall a play on the government initiative to get that $20 trillion of savings circulating. Alibaba is the toll taker. Uh middle class recovery play and for the first time ever, mainland Chinese stocks could buy Alibaba through the stock connect. So, imagine if you&#39;re getting three Amazon boxes at your door for the last 10 years, but the US government said you couldn&#39;t own Alib uh couldn&#39;t own Amazon and all of a sudden they said, you know, that company you&#39;re sending all your money to and they send you boxes. Uh you can own some equity in that company. And that&#39;s exactly what happened. Analyst analysts estimate 20 billion dollars in potential inflows from new buyers. I think we&#39;re at uh already eight billion or something like that just in the last six months. Something like that. So, the game&#39;s just beginning. You&#39;re getting another source of buyers until the foreign buyers start to step in on top of it. Um, by the way, owning China as a pension manager and a large asset manager was like owning energy in 2020. Now, if you if you didn&#39;t own an energy in the last year or so, you underperformed. So, they all all owned energy. So, they sell the bottom, they buy the top. Opinion follows trend. tariff exposure. Less than 1% of Alibaba&#39;s 134 billion in revenue came from the US, so it&#39;s a non-issue. Uh, the D-listing would only hurt Americans. And this is how you contact me. So, a lot of you ask me, podcast name is Hedge Fund Tips with Tom Hayes. I recommend you watch on YouTube. You&#39;ll get more value, but listen if you like to walk or play golf. Uh, Twitter, hedge fun tips. Tik Tok for all of you. Uh, official hedge fund tips. I&#39;m very popular with the Tik Tok crowd. Uh YouTube headphone tips is the channel and that&#39;s my email and contact information. Any\n\n### FEATURED_COMPANY_DEEP_DIVES\nre hitting on on uh every cylinders. we like a lot about.

Less than 1% of Alibaba&#39;s 134 billion in revenue came from the US, so it&#39;s a non-issue. Uh, the D-listing would only hurt Americans.\n\n Yeah. I think for Generrack uh it is seasonal and none of their guidance includes any type of uh extreme events and there&#39;s usually always an extreme event at this time of year. So they don&#39;t put it in. So they could they what we call sandbag. They very conservative on the guidance. Um you know we look we started building that thing. We had a basis below 100. It shot up to 194. It&#39;s come down to 124. It&#39;s not changed our view on the stock. It&#39;s just how it recovers. Thing had a heart attack. You know when you have a heart attack you get off the table. You don&#39;t run a marathon. You go out. You walk around with the pole. You let go of the pole. You think you&#39;re okay. You fall on the floor. or they&#39;re like go back to the poll for a little while. I mean 80% down is a heart attack. Okay. So now they&#39;re walking again with the pole and they&#39;re going to try again and then they&#39;re going to do better. And this happens. It is a very cyclical business because uh in in some of our video cast we&#39;ve gone through the cycles where they have the revenue declines and the cash flow declines and then it starts to reacelerate. But if you look at that slide I did in the last presentation cash flow is nearing record highs and the price the stock price is still down some 80%. This is a uh this is like, you know, Buffett talks about the fat pitch. Wait for the fat pitch. For me, this is a complete no-brainer. Yeah. So, they&#39;ve bought back uh we had we skipped through the slide, but they&#39;ve got 20 billion more on their buyback. They they&#39;ve been buying in tons and tons of stocks for the last few years. They started paying a dividend. They just announced a special dividend. Uh so, we&#39;re not in it for the dividend. It&#39;s nice to see them returning capital. They&#39;re going to continue. They the interesting thing difference between US managers and Chinese managers. The Chinese to their credit were buying every share they could get their hands on below 100 in the hole. Whereas US managers after the stocks up 10x they start b announcing big back by big buybacks so that there&#39;s liquidity for them to sell their own options. And it&#39;s a completely different mindset. So the Chinese buy low and sell high. the uh American managers for the most part when the stock collapses they&#39;re not in the market buying. So we&#39;re happy that they&#39;re doing it and uh their buyback rate is slowing in the 120s which I&#39;m very happy to see. I love that they were buying handover fist in the in the 80s and 70s and they they still have uh 20 billion of authorization and they will use that but um the time to buy for the for the company because they&#39;re stewards of my capital as an owner um was to be buying when when we were buying and uh and and you know I I don&#39;t think we&#39;re going to get material dips from here for them to buy in a huge part of the company. I think from here it&#39;s just going to be it&#39;s just going to keep pushing higher is my general view at this point. Like the pain is in the rear the majority of the pain is in the rearview mirror. I know because I lived it buying on every red day. Um, and now it&#39;s like it&#39;s like that Microsoft chart where it&#39;s just like fundamentals are getting better, but all of a sudden people start to get interested in the stock and all that pen. It&#39;s like holding a beach ball underwater like Gener. How is the cash flow getting so much better and the revenue is starting to improve and the margin starting to expand and the price is still the same as when they had negative cash flow. It&#39;s just you&#39;re holding the beach ball under water and once you let go, it just goes when it comes it comes all at once. That&#39;s the way these turnarounds work. Yes, I met Kathy. Kathy has a house next to our in the town over from our houses in Connecticut. Um, I met her in Tampa. She&#39;s a super sweet woman, like really approachable, nice person. Uh, it&#39;s a different game. I mean, that&#39;s not my lane. So I for me to comment, you know, she&#39;s trying to guess what technologies are going to change the world and she might be right and she might pick one and that&#39;s a thousand bagger and then it will go up. I can&#39;t predict her ability to predict. I can&#39;t even predict. That&#39;s why I don&#39;t predict. I I buy these boring businesses. I can sleep well at night that are quick doubles and triples. So uh I&#39;m the wrong person to ask. But um I hope so. I hope she does great. But uh it&#39;s not not for Ray. Not not what I do. Not not for me. Yeah. What are your thoughts on car manufacturers? General Motors and others are trading wealth. Yeah, great question. I like to buy the arms dealers, not the waring faction. So GM and Ford are going to be a race to the bottom in margins. They&#39;re going to start incentives are going to start going up. Volumes are going to start going up. Race to the bottom. You want to uh play in the companies that benefit from increased volumes and let them deal with the margin compression. Same with the home builders in my opinion. So, uh, that&#39;s how we play it. I think your thinking framework is correct. I just think there are better ways to play that theme. Yeah. All right. Cool. Yeah. Yeah. Um, of those, if you put a gun to my head, I&#39;d own 10 cent for sure. And, uh, if you said you got to own a third, I&#39;d say Muan, but no one has a gun to my head, so I&#39;m just happy owning Alibaba. So, uh, but yeah, I&#39;ve looked at all of them. Yeah. Yes. No, because Brad is one of the few people who can operate a rollup properly. So what he does is he come in comes in into a fragmented business, rolls them up, applies technology. He&#39;s really good at applying technology to get cost synergies. He&#39;s not just like a private equity where he just cuts jobs and hopes that the business keeps running with half the people. um he actually brings value ad operational and synergistic stuff and then scale buying and he&#39;s just done it so many times that he&#39;s one of the few people I would bet on on a rollup because he did it at United Rentals, he did it at Waste Connections, he did it at XBO and he&#39;s just a master of doing this. So um yeah, reasonable concern but wrong guy. Yeah. company. Which guy? Who was Oh, Brad Jacobs has started QXO. It&#39;s a roll up of building supplies to play the housing recovery. Yeah. Cool. All right. Well, thanks for staying a few minutes late. I appreciate it. And uh hope you enjoy. And we&#39;re back. Warren Buffett quote of the week. In the world of business, the people who are the most successful are those who are doing what they love. Uh, no question about it, ladies and gentlemen. I feel like I&#39;m on a treasure hunt every day. Uh, again, Buffett, you don&#39;t need to be a rocket scientist. Investing is not a game where the guy with the 160 IQ beats the guy with the 130 IQ. In fact, it&#39;s often the opposite because the guy with the 160 IQ tends to be more emotional and uh affected by the day-to-day and trying to analyze every\n\nI just think there are better ways to play that theme.

In the world of business, the people who are the most successful are those who are doing what they love. Uh, no question about it, ladies and gentlemen. I feel like I&#39;m on a treasure hunt every day. Uh, again, Buffett, you don&#39;t need to be a rocket scientist. Investing is not a game where the guy with the 160 IQ beats the guy with the 130 IQ. In fact, it&#39;s often the opposite because the guy with the 160 IQ tends to be more emotional and uh affected by the day-to-day and trying to analyze every headlines  rather than just being patient. Like the old study they did in Fidelity, they couldn&#39;t figure out why this one group of retail accounts outperformed every single one of their managers. And what they found after millions in research and time and effort to figure out what was the secret sauce, what they figured out was all the outperforming accounts had an owner that was dead for more than 10 years and the family didn&#39;t know the account existed. So no one sold anything. No one traded anything. It just went up over time, which is what markets do. And then\n\n### QUOTES_OF_THE_WEEK\nfinally , John Templeton, to buy when others are despondently selling and to sell when others are euphorically buying takes the greatest courage but provides the greatest profit. That&#39;s what we try to do here every single week and very grateful for all of you who um uh took this to heart last month and took advantage of the opportunities in April. You&#39;ve been amply rewarded or just sat tight when a lot of people didn&#39;t and a lot of people sold in the hole. That took a lot of courage and you are being rewarded. So kudos to you. Let&#39;s\n\nfinally , John Templeton, to buy when others are despondently selling and to sell when others are euphorically buying takes the greatest courage but provides the greatest profit. That&#39;s what we try to do here every single week and very grateful for all of you who um uh took this to heart last month and took advantage of the opportunities in April. You&#39;ve been amply rewarded or just sat tight when a lot of people didn&#39;t and a lot of people sold in the hole. That took a lot of courage and you are being rewarded. So kudos to you. Let&#39;s\n\nStocks may recover quickly from the tariff shock. The analogy they're drawing is that this is sharp like the COVID. Record shorting by other. So you're still got a lot of people caught in the hole. Like during COVID, which which forces them as buyers on every positive headline and according to Bessant, there's going to be many deals announced. Very hard to get bearish into that. Prime Book, US single stocks, positive value equals a ton of record short covering here, ladies and gentlemen. Just like you saw at the end of 2022, early 2023, time to be a buyer, not a seller. The shorts are the first buyers. Then the natural buyers come in, then the forced buyers come in. S&P 500 sectors announced buybacks. We talked about record announcements, 665 billion last week, year to date. Infoch, financials, communication services, consumer discretionary. You can't give away consumer discretionary. They're announcing a lot of buybacks and doing a lot of buybacks. More clues that the lows are in for 2025. We covered this on a different chart. Ryan Dietrich also put it out. Performance after 55% of components make a 20-day high 1970 to current shows very positive returns. Option sentiment remains bearish on the dollar. As I said, now that everyone's getting bearish, we probably get a counter trend bounce before we resume the secular trend lower. US earnings revision momentum turns positive. Gage showed renewed optim optimism after 6 months of negative readings. Okay, so that's a positive thing to start to see. Midcap forward earnings relative to small cap going up. Bulls are built on the shoulders of bears. You can see these big bull markets and the kind of short-term draw down. So which we just had a bare market draw a 20% draw down and now we are in bull market as the markets recovered. NASDAQ over 20% and the other indices following suit some of the European indices at all-time highs. World percentage of equity indices above 50-day moving average. This is what you see coming out of a trough in fall of 2023. That's a good thing. That first abrupt move upward. non- US markets while cheap relative to the US are not particularly inexpensive relative to their own history. China again being the lowest emerging markets, United Kingdom, that's where there's some serious opportunity there. Another rare and bullish signal. S&P performance after 60% of components make a 20-day new high. 12 months out, up 9% on average, 10.4% medium. When Degraph and Zwag breath thrusts occur. When Degraph and Zwag breath thrusts occur within one month of each other. Six Six months later, you're up 16% on average. One year later, up 26%. So, a lot of positive things to be looking forward to. Money market mutual funds held by retail and institutions. Lot of dry powder here. Record dry powder impacted Buffett's gifts. Buffett's fortune would have topped Musk's if he hadn't donated shares to charity. He'd be $87 billion wealthier than Elon Musk if he hadn't given away so much. He'd be worth $400 billion. This is the goat, ladies and gentlemen. Never doubt it. Never think it will be replicated. Buffett was and is the greatest of all time. Hedge funds still look to short stocks which it is further buying power for upside on every positive headline. Won't be straight up will be fits and starts. Upside is the direction. Like I said months ago, welcome to Trump 2.0. Same as Trump 1.0. New volatility, new tweet, new volatility resolves to the upside over time. The share of those who carry credit card balances is below 2019 levels for all income groups. The c customer balance sheet is still good. Flows into Europe are picking up. Opinion follows trend. Loan growth in China expected to soon pick up. As a matter of fact, global M2 money supply, pull it up on Google, is reacelerating. And a lot of that is attributable to China's massive stimulus that's in the pipeline and happening as we speak. And we're seeing it in the numbers. This is S&P 500. Healthcare relative performance is off the charts low. There's opportunities to be had there. We expressed through biotech basket and Baxter for now, but we continue to look for opportunity. Teima. So, you can see a lot of the um a lot of the obesity stocks got hit. You remember when Lily was so hot and I said, \"Ladies and gentlemen, there there's there's competitions coming.\" Just like I said with Nvidia, competition's coming. Um when they get that extreme and that certain Nova Nordis and everything else, they've just been slaughtered. Post election years tend to bottom in early April and rally. So here we are in the seasonality that bodess well all the way into late summer. So let's keep the heat on and stay focused. Then value benefit is so you can see where we are relative to where we should be and it looks like some more strength maybe a little weakness in mid July. Value benefit from broading broadening Q1 broadening has averaged 42% since February 19th. So that's a sign of stocks beating the S&P. That's broadening. That's healthy. That's good for stock pickers like us. United States retail sales year-over-year they soft data they keep saying that the world is ending the hard data they keep spending like there's no tomorrow. United Healthcare Group biggest draw down since 2009. A lot of people keep asking. I think there's no way to have certainty that there wasn't some level of fraud. The question is how much. I think we're close to the levels where you got you could take a coin flip gamble. We're not going to do that. But if it gets to 200 or below and stays there for a little while, we might be interested. I think enough people and institutions got slaughtered in this that it's going to take a while to rebuild a base. So, we're in no rush and we want more information and we're willing to miss it. Healthc care sector relative to S&P 500, the cheapest since 2001. There's opportunity. There's a pony in this pile as they say. High yield credit spreads coming in. Sign of no recession. There was fear in April 7th. That fear has subsided. Overall, Prime Book gross versus net leverage still a lot of room to run for risk on and chasing electricity consumption going through the roof. Comtock resources, how you doing? Alibaba cloud year-on-year revenue growth up 18% year-on-year. Look at the acceleration not just in the absolute revenue but in the pace at which the revenue is growing fueled by uh being number one in cloud services fueled by AI products and just be beginning. Mike Zucardi Bank of America over 70% of survey respondents plan on vacationing this summer. A higher percentage than last year's survey. Good thing to do if you believe the world is coming to an end. uh but uh your actions do not reflect it and we focus on actions not words. Four-year cycle for 2025 we're following right along TAC which again points to strength all the way into uh early August with a little bit of bumpiness in June. This has been our framework since the beginning of the year. We didn't expect the magnitude of the draw down. We were looking for buckle up buttercup February March 8 to 10% pullback. We got Liberation Day and we used it to our advantage. You got to play the cards you're dealt, not the cards you want and we played that uh like like an absolute World Series of Poker Champion in April and uh we're excited and uh you played right along with us and uh that's that's just absolutely amazing. Breath of Earnings suggests Bed should be in a cutting phase. We agree too late. Powell is a real thing. He's 150 basis points too restrictive percent of S&P 500 members above the 50-day moving average now at 75% abrupt short covering. Now we get into the chase phase. Magnificent 7 mirroring Nifty50 performance. Uh I don't love these analogs but it's worth noting pockets of it for sure. XLV after 52- week low and positive close a year out. That's the health care sector up on average 21%. Got to be focused on health care right now. Concentration of S&P 500 market cap and earnings in the 10 largest index constituents. The market cap uh is 37% share of the S&P 500 while the earnings are only 30%. These numbers have a tendency to converge. Which is why we said uh before the draw down of mag 7 that mag 7 was going to correct. That was go back to all of our podcasts in uh the last quarter of last year. They certainly did and everyone said it was tariffs but most of them are unaffected by tariffs. So what actually wasn't? it was the fact that their earnings growth decelerated from 33% to 15% ballpark and um and their multiple still hasn't come down commensurate with that reduction in earnings power. Therefore, we do think that while they will bounce and maybe trade as a group back to the top of the range, the real opportunity is going to be in the 493 uh and these will continue to underperform relative to the indices. That doesn't mean crash. That doesn't mean tech wreck of 2000 or 2022. It means underperform relative to the unmagnificent 493 as a basket. Gap between mag 7 and 493 earnings growth is expected to narrow. 36% earnings growth last year, 15% this year. Unmnificent 4% last year, moving up to 13%. The euro's had its best year-to- date gain since 2020. Dollar weakening, euro gaining. People are starting to get excited, which means um we'll have a short-term pause. Retail market share reached 36% in late April on low market volume. Tariff estimates keep sliding. Went all the way up to 28% now down to 14%. Probably nets out around 10% give or take. Plus the non-tariff barriers is going to be the whole name of the game particularly as it relates to China opening their market. biggest six weeks VIX percent declines and forward S&P total returns. So on average uh you're looking at five years out 92% return average one year out 20.8 uh and uh we are in that neighborhood. What did we have here? Uh goodness. Wow. The biggest VIX crush. So if you look at some of these others, they were up 46% a year out. But anyway, the point is the mean a year out is 20%. When you get the VIX collapse off such high levels, S&P 500 one-year forward returns after the last 58% of the S&P 500 stocks hit a four new four-week high. You can see on average 16.1%. Lot of positivity, almost 100% positivity ratio, if not 100% exactly. smaller share of homes built in 2010s than any decade since 1940s. You know what happened next? The game was on. We're going to talk, we talked about in that presentation uh at the money show the reasons why that's going to be taking place. US versus foreign stock fund performance. Foreign large blend is up 12.6% year-to date. US large blend is up 6 12% outperformance of international versus US. That's going to continue. The last time you had that divergence, you had seven years of international outperformance. Prime Book US Energy uh weekly net flows that people are starting to uh nibble around energy stocks. Magnificent 7 PE premium versus the 493 has come back to uh 43% premium, but the earnings growth again still probably doesn't justify it. That's why I think it trades back up to the highs, but it probably as a basket uh stalls out. What if you panic sold and missed April 9th? Uh you're still down 9% versus flat. Or if you listen to this podcast, you're up a ton. Okay, that's the bottom line. Uh, and if you were on that client call that we did, you're up a lot more than a ton. Housing inventory active listing count in Florida. So, Florida tends to be a leading indicator and you're seeing a lot of supply in Florida and you're seeing price declines in a lot of pockets of Florida. So, we're keeping a close eye on that. That should could help. Affordability. Consumers don't believe break evens or CPI. University of Michigan. A lot of these data have been coming in by political party. The Republicans think there's no inflation, the Democrats think it's 6%. So, the truth is actually probably right in the middle like everything else. Hong Kong equities surged for a fourth consecutive month in April, reaching 166 billion Hong Kong dollars, well above historical average. While momentum remains strong, easing US China tensions and yuan stabilization. May temper May inflow signaling a potential pause in the capital shift toward Hong Kong. So, we saw a little bit of that. I think that's goes right back on based on they uh lowered rates again for the first time in 7 months. The Chinese, they're going to keep the pedal to the metal. Sector fund inflows going back into technology in the short term. Financials again, I think top of the range is where that targets. Equity positioning across sectors. Utilities is overweight. Materials is underweight. We like Albamaro there. Demographics are a tailwind to housing demand. We can't overemphasize that. Go to hedge fundtips.com get the slide deck. When you go to the article of the week, which is Baba back in business, you will see the slide deck there. No, this is not another rally. S&P performance after 19% in 27 trading days has average another 9.2% up in the next 12 months. Atlanta GDP now is for the this quarter. Q2 is 2.3 or 2.5% give or take which means no recession. We got negative GDP although it was inventory affected pull forward uh in Q1. You still don't want two consecutive quarters of negative GDP growth. Look at all the Dubai buildings in the background. Pretty cool. And then NASDAQ compositive change in the three years after Netscape release versus CH GPT release. So you had a shakeout. This implies that we got more to go. They're doing an analog bespoke Paul Hickeyy's uh kind of trying to show that there's a lot more upside. We agree NASDAQ composite change in the 5 years after Netscape released versus chat GPT release. These analoges are worth noting but not worth betting the ranch on. But I do think there's a lot of runway. Roaring 2000s is nent. We're halfway through. US households buy highest price home they can afford. um house price. Yeah, and that's the problem. The median house is in the 400s and most people can't afford it. Funding spreads, professional investor positioning, average funding spread, S&P level. So, [Music] um this will chase up GS social media economic sentiment index university. So, Goldman Sachs sentiment is high. The University of Michigan is very low. These are divergences. This is start looking a lot like hard data versus soft data. We think that the soft data will catch up to the hard data as opinion follows trend. Net retail net imbalance before 12:30 p.m. Very high.

The core of our thesis is one a proxy for Chinese AI and two the toll taker for the middle class recovery pivot toward consumption $20 trillion of savings. Part of what makes Alibaba so unique is it&#39;s essentially the only company in the world, let alone in China, that have both. Number one, a marketleading cloud position and number two, a marketleading in-house large language model, Quen 2.4. Then there&#39;s Alibaba, number one leader in China with 36% of cloud share in the Quen 3 model, which is the world&#39;s largest open-source model family and a top performer globally. The bottom line is Baba is firing on all cylinders and the beach ball hasn&#39;t even broken the surface yet. Management returned 16.5 billion to shareholders in fiscal year 25 including 4.6 billion in dividends at $2 per ads and 11.9 billion in share buybacks which reduced the share count by 5.1%. For Baba&#39;s largest segment, AI related product revenue reached its seventh consecutive quarter of tripledigit year-over-year growth. Stock-based compensation, which Ali used Alibaba used to hand out like candy, was just 473 million this year, down 52% year-over-year.\n\nrevenues increased 12% in Q4 and are expected to remain strong, driven by the60% 60 basis point software service fee and the expanding use of Quanzan, a merchant advertising tool. The medium-term goal remains stabilizing market share for TTG which currently sits around 40% i.e. 40% of all e-commerce revenues in China go through Alibaba. Management returned 16.5 billion to shareholders in fiscal year 25 including 4.6 billion in dividends at $2 per ads and 11.9 billion in share buybacks which reduced the share count by 5.1%. Management views instant commerce as a huge opportunity is starting to lean into it. The market is expected to grow from 500 to 600 million consumers all the way to a billion over time in China. Early results have far exceeded original expectations as management integrates instant commerce through TTG driving new users as well as increased stick stickiness frequency and overall consumption. These investments will weigh on IBIDA margins in the near term but will be a long-term growth driver for IBIDA&#39;s largest segment. For Baba&#39;s largest segment, AI related product revenue reached its seventh consecutive quarter of tripledigit year-over-year growth. Stock-based compensation, which Ali used Alibaba used to hand out like candy, was just 473 million this year, down 52% year-over-year.

Alibaba AIDC came in slightly below expectations with revenue growth of 22% year-over-year to 4.63 billion. Most importantly, management remains on track to achieve quarterly profitability for the segment in fiscal year 2026 as they work toward profitability at scale for one of the company&#39;s largest overall segments. All other loss generating segments continue to improve with losses narrowing year-over-year. Free cash flow for the quarter was only 516 million down 76. But this was largely intentional and mainly due to increased cloud infrastructure spending. Cash provided by operating activities was nearly $4 billion 3.8 billion during the quarter up 18% year-over-year which supports this explanation. During the quarter, management continued to monetize non-core assets with the sale of Sun Art and in time expected to generate $2.6 billion in cash proceeds.\n\nfinally shifted toward long-term cash incentives backed by a $50 billion net cash position.

Normal plays back in California on Thursday. super excited uh to see the family more than anything else. And then um we&#39;ll get back on a more normal schedule with the podcast and the article. First question comes from Pat McK. Just listened to Hey Tom, just listened to an earnings call for the first time and really got a ton of value from it. Immediately listened to a few more. Uh, one thing did stand out on Cooper Standard. We covered this a couple weeks ago. Pull up the Cooperstandard article on hedge funips.com. And congratulations on starting to do real work and listening to the calls. You are on your way, homeboy. Uh, York Bourgeoa. Uh, hey Mr. Hayes. Hope you had a great time in Miami. Nice time in Dubai. Still here. While you were at the money show, what percentage of both presenters and audience members were hypnotized by shiny objects? And were you surprised by the seemingly large amount? Well, if you know the answer, why ask the question? Uh, it was basically 100%. Second question, if you have time, what&#39;s the material difference between levered and unlevered free cash flows? One is before interest expense, one is after interest expense. Uh, I like levered because it&#39;s it&#39;s an expense. So it&#39;s not if you have to pay the expense, it&#39;s not free cash if you&#39;re excluding it. So it&#39;s free cash after expense. Um, uh, leverage is the way to, uh, measure it in my humble opinion. Appreciate the work as always. Have a safe trip back. Thanks, York. Next is from Tim D. Thoughts on Reddit. Uh, I think I covered this before and, uh, welcome to the podcast. I can tell you&#39;re new by the question. Uh, Reddit. Reddit has been cyclical, by the way. It&#39;s running hot right now. Cash flows, revenues, margins, through the roof. Um, let&#39;s see. Snapshots, financial analysis. I mean, this is something that you&#39;re making a gamble that it&#39;s going to stay relevant. It&#39;s hard to make those gamles, but right now it looks hot. 10 times sales, but it&#39;s making money. Price to earnings is 44 times, but it&#39;s got earnings growth. So, all you can make the bullish argument, this is not one that I want to participate in. Um, I&#39;m going to pass. This is not a quality enough business that I can predict the cash flows. So, not for me. Uh, but may work for you. Just a different uh Okay, here&#39;s an article from Korea from Allen. Honda to scale back on EVs and focus on hybrids. That means more money for Cooper Standard. They make more on hybrids than both IC&#39;s and EVs, but they make more on EVs than ICEs. Jason Zen, our models are based on the lowest case scenario, which is ICE. Uh, swung by Nike over the weekend and my wife tried on pair of quote Infinity Run running shoes and was surprised how comfortable it was. I was like, &quot;This can&#39;t be.&quot; Pulled out my phone and did a quick Google search and bam, Reactex foam. Now, why own Nike when you&#39;re a shareholder by proxy through Cooper Standard? because Cooper Standard makes the souls on all the ReactX shoes. Uh, this was the most exciting shoe purchase in my life and it&#39;s all thanks to you. Cheers, Jason. All right, man. We have zero attributed to uh Nike shoe revenues in our Cooper Standard models, but we will take the whipped cream and it goes to show. Uh, okay. David T, look at Lion. Uh, Lionsgate Studios, which just spent spend spun out of Lionsgate. Um, yeah, I think if I&#39;m not mistaken, Steven Minutian&#39;s involved in this and that guy&#39;s a smart guy. So, if you like these kind of dogs, but keep in mind, his wife is like an actress. So, this might just be a project to get her work. Uh I I&#39;ve looked at a lot of these Lionsgate things over the years. You really have to know the business and some of the parts and all that stuff, but uh that&#39;s a jockey I would bet with, but you you have to be sure it&#39;s a financial decision and not a vanity project, and I&#39;m not so sure, so I&#39;m not going to participate. Good morning. Congratulations on the podcast. Can you check out West Pharma? I think it is interesting given the quality of the company. Okay, let&#39;s take a look. This is going to be pipeline understanding. I mean, we&#39;ll take a quick look at the financials, but you&#39;re going to have to do a lot of work on your own if the financials hold up. Stocks down, so is cash flow. Looks like cash flows, revenues are down, margins are down, everything&#39;s down as it should be, but cash flow looks like it might be recovering a little bit. So, um, tell me what the turnaround story is and what the drug pipeline is and the patent cliffs are. Uh, which is why we tend to invest certainly in biotech in baskets. Um, for me, it&#39;s not enough of a margin of safety that I want to get excited about it, but I can see why you&#39;re interested and it might be worth doing extra work.

I know you have through Albamaro. Okay. All right. So, he&#39;s interested in or um Bezi is interested in she uh okay, Rio because of the dividend. That&#39;s not a reason to get involved in the stock. But let&#39;s take a look at the stock because I do think there&#39;s something to be said here. And now&#39;s probably the time because these do well when emerging markets do well. It&#39;s just like, God, a lot of good news priced in already, but maybe no. Price has gone up, cash flow&#39;s gone down, revenues have gone down. Yeah, you could play the turnaround story, but the market&#39;s been kind of giving it credit for the turnaround story. Not enough margin of safety for me. Uh, not enough reason to own it for the dividend because you could lose that in one day. So, um, but thank you for listening and look for something with a little higher margin of safety. Even though this might be okay, it&#39;s just not worth risking a dollar in our view if we can&#39;t get a double or triple in a reasonable amount of time. Matt Delp Priari, let&#39;s talk about the yen. Jet pan rates rising negatively impacted global markets. Is this a real concern? It was a concern for MAG 7 and we warned about that all last year. That&#39;s playing out. that will continue to play out which is why international is going to outperform US and unmagnificent 493 is going to outperform MAG 7 and value is going to go back to outperforming growth as it has for the last 98 years by a magnitude of 4.4% 4% per year. Or in English, if you put a million dollars in value in 1927 or a million dollars in growth, you get 68 million more going into value, even despite the last 15 years and the aberrational zero interest rate policy period, which is not going to persist or reoccur anytime soon. Ewan Musaki, avid listener for years. What are your thoughts on Mona as a possible investment? First off, thanks for your long-term loyalty. Uh he&#39;s talking about um one with that. You got to understand the pipeline, but the problem is is Mr. A is they&#39;re blowing through their cash. So unless a miracle happens with one of their drugs soon, which it very well could. Um, so study the pipeline and get some level of confidence in what&#39;s going to be happening imminently because in the meantime, this is what we call a cash incinerator. Burning cash like it&#39;s going out of style to the tune of this. Is this serious? Four billion a year. Let me see. I mean, you know how hard you have to work to incinerate $4 billion a year? You could work a 100 hours a week and not spend $4 billion a year. Let&#39;s take a look at how they&#39;re doing this feat of burning $4 billion a year and not making any money. First off, the balance sheet, they got 6.87 billion of cash at the end of the year. We probably have no debt. No material debt. What are they doing on the cash flow here though? They are literally blowing $4 billion the last two years. So, uh, the only reason you would get involved in this if is if after you do your research, you&#39;re damn certain they&#39;re going to have some blockbuster drug in the next 12 months. Otherwise, they&#39;re going to be out of cash in two years. So, um, not for me.\n\nthat will continue to play out which is why international is going to outperform US and unmagnificent 493 is going to outperform MAG 7 and value is going to go back to outperforming growth as it has for the last 98 years by a magnitude of 4.4% 4% per year.

Same successful strategy with Vernon. high quality rate, strong track record, top tier assets. Do you see any parallels? I don&#39;t like multif family here. I think all of the excess inventory is going I I if the starter house thesis is correct and the family formation thesis is correct, which I believe it is, I think we&#39;re going to have a glut of multif family. And I think that&#39;s going to be and considering all the people you&#39;re seeing now that are so excited about multif family, it just feels like it&#39;s the wrong time to be getting involved. The right time was a while back, Alexandria, maybe a decade back. The wrong time is when those people are laying off to you and teaching you how to buy B multif family. Not a good formula. Alexandria real estate a Oh, by the way, there was a guy and his family at the money show who wanted me to look at Owen&#39;s Corning. Uh, yeah. All right, Alexandria. Let&#39;s just take a look here. It&#39;s kind of priced in a lot of bad news here. Cash flow continues. Revenues are going up. Cash flow is rolling over. Margins are starting to recover. What&#39;s the dividend? Let me see. I should be able to find it here. Net debt is 12 billion. So, it&#39;s pricing as if they&#39;re not going to be able to refinance some of the debt. Let&#39;s take a look at the financials. balance sheet. [Music] Okay. All right. They got a half a billion dollars of cash and they&#39;ve got $12 billion of debt, but it&#39;s secured by the properties. Cash flow [Music] is pretty decent. is the [Music] uh see if they put the dividend here. I personally don&#39;t want to be in multif family but you know this come in a lot that I&#39;m inclined to say 100% worth doing extra work on it. um you have to be open to the idea that they might have to cut their dividend if they have any problem with financing, but not probably won&#39;t be an issue. And then you really want to know the properties. I mean, in Verernado&#39;s case, I knew all the properties in New York and they were the highest. So, you get a 7% yield, it&#39;s probably okay. Uh you just got to do more work on it. I I think if you love the idea, it&#39;s worth now starting to do the work. Uh, good question. Okay,\n\nAlexandria real estate a Oh, by the way, there was a guy and his family at the money show who wanted me to look at Owen&#39;s Corning. Uh, yeah. All right, Alexandria.

Okay,### ASK_ME_ANYTHING_QA\nhere is  from uh Albert Rud and his lovely family. I got to meet his daughters. I think one&#39;s at MIT and one is at Rice, so he did a good job from Sarasota. Um, Owens Corning on the basis he listened to my house healthc care present, not healthcare, housing presentation. I don&#39;t know which time zone I&#39;m on, guys. I started in Pacific Standard Time. I went to Eastern. I don&#39;t know what time zone this is. Uh so it&#39;s come in about 25 30%. I think where I came out on this was if I owned it from much lower levels, I would be a hodler, i.e. hold. If I didn&#39;t own it, I would be I would probably want to see a little more weakness, which you might not get. I think you&#39;re generally okay here. Would I put new money to work in this? No. There&#39;s not enough margin of safety for me, but um would I add here if I owned it? No. I think it&#39;s a great business. I think your thinking is correct. I think you own it from much lower levels. In which case, hodddle it. It might go lower before it goes higher, but there&#39;s no reason to really panic out of it anytime soon. And um the housing plays that I mentioned are the ones that I would favor. But uh definitely appreciate the question. Appreciate you coming to all the presentations and introducing your lovely family. Les Edelman interested in your thoughts on WNC. Wabash. Okay. I like the concept. Cash flow the rec the What did this thing do? I mean, the revenues are scary to me. They&#39;ve come down a lot, but they&#39;ve done that before. Seems to be a very cyclical business. The margins, it this is a trade. This is not a business that you want to own. I I I don&#39;t even know what it does yet, and I&#39;m just telling you this is not an own forever. This is a trade. Engineered Solutions for Transportation, Logistics, Infrastructure in the US. Uh, Transportation Solutions Part and Service offers dry van trailers, platform trailers, refrigerated trailers, stainless steel, aluminum tran trailers, dry freight bulk bodies, cargo, flatbed bodies, truck mounting, blah blah blah. It&#39;s probably not a business that should be public. This would be a good private equity target. Um, I think it works as a trade. Decent find. Let&#39;s just take a look at the balance sheet to make sure they&#39;re not going to have financing risk and then we will move on. 115 million in cash, 400 million in debt. It&#39;s it&#39;s probably okay. Again, it&#39;s a trade. It&#39;s not You&#39;re just playing for a bounce. Um, Thomas Bar, thanks for all you do. Really enjoy your show. Relate strongly to your product. Want us to talk about iHeart. I Okay, this guy is super excited about iHeart Radio. My guess is this thing is overly indebted and you&#39;re taking financing risk in a dying business, but it&#39;s down a lot, so that&#39;s why he likes it. Um, IHRT negative free cash flow. Revenues down and then flat for almost a decade. Margins continue to contract. This is uh a stock that has fundamentals consistent with what the price has done. The question is, is it going to turn? is their one last puff in this cigar butt. They got 250 million of cash and they&#39;ve got um $5 billion of debt. This is pricing like it&#39;s going out of business and that is not a far-fetched idea, but not a guarantee either. So, um it&#39;s a gamble. I don&#39;t take gamles. Rule number one is don&#39;t lose money. Rule number two is don&#39;t forget rule number one. It&#39;s a might make it, but I wouldn&#39;t. It&#39;s a coin flip. You might gamble and win. You might gamble and lose. I&#39;d say go to Foxwoods and bet on black. Pete Bass, what would your opinion be on Pterodine? Great business. Ter, is it the right time to buy? Uh, it&#39;s probably okay. This has a DNA of good things over the years. Let&#39;s see what it&#39;s doing lately. Cash flow and revenue are showing signs of recovering. Margins are showing signs. Uh I&#39;m sure the balance sheet is probably okay. Let&#39;s take a look. And 600 million of cash longterm debt 600. So probably okay. I think you&#39;re probably okay here. Uh just understand the business before you buy anything. Uh okay.\n\nit works as a trade. Decent find.

There&#39;s a lot more in the metro than you think. We only need 517,000 acres of like 470 million and more of it is in metro areas than you think. Go look at the slides in the article of the week. Next, Chris Williamson. You&#39;re right on Hormell. He&#39;s saying that upside is probably capped at a double. I agree. Uh but that&#39;s fine. It&#39;s good to have a defensive one in there here and there. Thoughts on Murphy Oil? Uh I looked at this one on my own. I think this one&#39;s okay. See? Yeah, it&#39;s that one&#39;s probably okay. Um, Micah Kelsey, thank you for conducting the Cooper Standards CEO interview. Cooper Standards printing cash just like you predicted. Are you looking at adding Estee Lauder at this price? Keep thinking it&#39;s bottomed out. Uh no, but we&#39;re we we&#39;re holding, you know, we don&#39;t uh we&#39;re not adding, we&#39;re not subtracting. We&#39;re just comfortable with the position. We sized it according to the risk, which was serious. It was a play on China, so we already had exposure. They&#39;ve got free cash flow. They&#39;re turning it around. It&#39;s going to take a little while to build a new shareholder base, but no, we didn&#39;t add, we didn&#39;t subtract. We&#39;re just hold hodling and we&#39;re perfectly fine with that. Manic Bouani uh Madak Vajani says quote all the fundamental stories the last guy mentioned end quote. Are you getting a cup with that on it? No. Um but thank you for the comment. Daniel Borman, hey Tom, what are your thoughts on Yeti stock? We&#39;ve covered this one a bunch of times. I continue to look at it. Continue to pass. Can&#39;t think of a reason why I&#39;m passing other than just instinct and no position in the portfolio. But yeah, it&#39;s a high return on invested capital business. There are still some growth left. Cash flow is recovering. There&#39;s nothing to really not love. So the answer is I think you&#39;re right and I want to do more work on it and it may take off without me and and and but it destroyed a lot of people. It&#39;s a broken growth stock. Now the value buyers can come in and it may take another year to build a base or it may take off without us but I think you&#39;re in the neighborhood of what would be something worth looking at. What&#39;s your thoughts on R&amp;B? uh higher it&#39;s going to be part of the trade deal. Victor Hansen, hi. Best finance podcast recommending to everyone. Thank you. Superior industry. [Music] Um I think I like this one. Let me see. Oh, what the hell happened here? Superior Industries. This thing must be going BK because that is trading like it&#39;s death. Let&#39;s see. All right. You&#39;re telling me the debt is not maturing until 2028. They&#39;re free cash flow positive by a hair. Revenues are declining. Margins are starting to bottom out. [Music] Uh, wow. What the hell happened to this business? Let&#39;s see. Let&#39;s see. 480 million. They only have 10 million of cash and 480 million of debt. So, the market&#39;s saying it&#39;s going bankrupt. Uh they might not have to refinance, but can they service the debt is the problem. That&#39;s the problem, ladies and gentlemen. So, you and you know, so they got negative10 million of free cash flow. They got 10 million of cash, 450 million of debt. Trading like a bankruptcy. and it may very well be a bankruptcy. So, uh, this is a gamble. You got to see if they have assets they can sell. How are they going to raise cash? What the turnaround plan is, but you are playing on a nice edge. Go to Moheaggan Sun, bet on black. Griffin Brown, one of Buffett, Munger, and Graham&#39;s great biggest lessons, if not was the power of compounding over decades. Well, they they had a different structure, okay? They had permanent capital. So, what Buffett did before he had a public vehicle was exactly what we did. A lot of turnarounds for doubles and triples. And then when he got a permanent capital structure and public company and unlimited free float coming in from the insurance premiums, he moved up and did buy forever businesses, which don&#39;t go on sale very much, but they compound over time. Different structure, different strategy, same guy. It wasn&#39;t Munger that twisted his arm that he was doing things all wrong. Buffett does what he wants to do. He&#39;s the goat. Munger was just a sideshow. That was a huge contributor. But Munger, Buffett is what made the magic. Uh, and he adjusted based on the capital uh structure that he had less than he did because he didn&#39;t think it wasn&#39;t that he didn&#39;t think what he did when he was managing partnerships wasn&#39;t better. It&#39;s what made sense for the structure. His performance was better doing the turnarounds than it was when he got the law of large numbers and he went for quality. But the quality matched the constant inflow of premiums at zero to negative cost that he could just put to work set and forget versus uh do shorter time. His priorities changed and his structure changed and that&#39;s why he did that. So why we have a three to five year horizon is because we are go we have to perform in a reasonable amount of time uh and we want to have excess returns. So that&#39;s why we do what we do and how we do it. We will find businesses that will want to own for a lifetime. But the ones that double and triple the fact that it got to the point that it can have that type of expected value in a short period of time tells me that&#39;s not a hold forever. Those are the businesses that fall 10 20%. you buy it, you hold it, but you&#39;re not going to dramatically outperform in the short term. And that&#39;s why we uh do that. Is UNH Enron are the buy of a lifetime? The answer is you can&#39;t know. So just because it&#39;s in the\n\nheadlines  doesn&#39;t mean you have to play, Eric. And for that reason, I pass. It could it could rebound back to 600 tomorrow. I would it wouldn&#39;t even phase me. Um um and it could absolutely be a lot worse because you don&#39;t know, you know, where there&#39;s smoke. there could be fire and there&#39;s cockroaches behind the wall board. So, you have to but at some point it might be worth to get involved. It&#39;s just not now in my view even though you had all the insider buyers. Thou dot protestth. Um maybe it&#39;s all over in a week, but I don&#39;t think so. Department of Justice doesn&#39;t announce that and just let it go like our bad. They&#39;re clean back to back to business as normal. It&#39;s going to drag on and it&#39;s going to be an overhang for a while and a distraction. Hey Tom, thank you for sharing. BFIT, thank you for sharing the knowledge. You&#39;re the best. Thank you. That&#39;s very kind. BFI company is a lowcost gym operator. Market trend. Okay. So, it&#39;s basically a Planet Fitness, tons of cash, revenues, margins. Uh, this one might be a good one. I don&#39;t like the fattiness, no pun intang um the gym business. I&#39;ve seen them all come and go, but this one looks good for now. So, I think you&#39;re probably on to something and definitely worth doing the work on it and just know that that business is not a hold forever business. Maybe get a double out of it and call it a day. If that you just see the balance sheet and cash flow real quick, 58 million of cash, and then long-term debt is a billion. What&#39;s the free cash flow? So, that&#39;s something that&#39;s an alarm for me. I I I don&#39;t like that business generally. It looked decent at first blush, but as I look a little closer. I mean, the cash flow is pretty good. Maybe do more work. Ru Reynolds will mull. Oh, this 10-year-old at the Irone um wants to be short Cooper Standard. And uh on a margin compression thesis, um I&#39;m just going to say I&#39;ll take the other side of that trade and let&#39;s see where we are in 12 months, ladies and gentlemen. Uh good luck with that one. Joe Vandy, EW scripts, SSP, assuming this is like a TV company or something. Let&#39;s see. Free cash flow revenues. Huh? What do these guys do? Must have a lot of debt. Yeah, national news and entertainment. There&#39;s a bunch of these. God, this is a tough business. This is a cigar butt business. I&#39;m guessing the balance sheet looks like death. 23 million of cash, 2.7 billion of debt. Go to Las Vegas Sands. Bet it all on black. This is not for me. It might work as a trade. I&#39;m not going to participate and I&#39;m not going to lose sleep if you get rich on it. Error of omission, not commission. Rule number one, don&#39;t lose money. Rule number two, don&#39;t forget rule number one. Charles River Labs from Martin GR ZY W Grizzki. Say that three times fast. CRL This is going to take a while. This is a broken Momo stock. I know it&#39;s down a lot. Look at cash flow, though. Record highs. Margins compressing. Show me how margins are going to turn around. Uh, I think you&#39;re probably going to be right. And I think it&#39;s going to take a lot longer than you think to turn around. Lot of broken people here. Uh let&#39;s take a look at the balance sheet just so we can take solveny risk off the table hopefully. 2.7 billion in debt. How much cash? Something&#39;s hurting with the model. So you got to get comfort in the business before you invest a dollar. 194 in cash. 2.2 billion in debt. This is not a great great situation. Uh understand why it&#39;s down so much. What&#39;s the turnaround plan? You&#39;re going to have to do work on this one because they don&#39;t have all the time in the world with that balance sheet. They probably have some time, but not all the time. So,\n\n wants to be short Cooper Standard.

Let&#39;s get right to our floor show. Joining me now is Grey Hill Capital Chairman Thomas Hayes and Freedom Capital Markets chief global strategist Jay Woods live from the New York Stock Exchange. Tom, I&#39;ll start with you. You both like Disney. There&#39;s no question about it. You know, uh, this rally that we&#39;ve seen in the last four weeks, it&#39;s like Buffett always said, if you wait for the Robins to sing, it&#39;s already spring. We&#39;re up 15% since Donald Trump tweeted. Now is a great time to buy stocks. Last week, he said US is going to boom. Disney is a beneficiary. We were on the network four weeks ago saying, &quot;Buy Disney at $85. It&#39;s 111.&quot; Guess what? It&#39;s going over 200 over the next three years. All of their divisions are hitting on all cylinders. Mid double digit growth. the cruise ships, the parks, streaming, 180 million subscribers. They added two and a half million subscribers. This is a high quality business with a durable mode. Well, and Jay, the concern as we were going into Disney&#39;s earnings was worries about the theme parks and that ended up being uh one of the positives along with of course who was going to replace uh Bob Iger and Disney Plus. Jay, why do you like Disney? Well, I look at it from a technical level. This stock had been beaten down for years. We\n\n### MEDIA_APPEARANCE_RECAP\nBut my next guests both say there&#39;s another name to have in your portfolio who&#39;s also bringing the happiest place on earth to the Middle East. Let&#39;s get right to our floor show. Joining me now is Grey Hill Capital Chairman Thomas Hayes and Freedom Capital Markets chief global strategist Jay Woods live from the New York Stock Exchange. Tom, I&#39;ll start with you. You both like Disney. There&#39;s no question about it. You know, uh, this rally that we&#39;ve seen in the last four weeks, it&#39;s like Buffett always said, if you wait for the Robins to sing, it&#39;s already spring. We&#39;re up 15% since Donald Trump tweeted. Now is a great time to buy stocks. Last week, he said US is going to boom. Disney is a beneficiary. We were on the network four weeks ago saying, &quot;Buy Disney at $85. It&#39;s 111.&quot; Guess what? It&#39;s going over 200 over the next three years. All of their divisions are hitting on all cylinders. Mid double digit growth. the cruise ships, the parks, streaming, 180 million subscribers. They added two and a half million subscribers. This is a high quality business with a durable mode. Well, and Jay, the concern as we were going into Disney&#39;s earnings was worries about the theme parks and that ended up being uh one of the positives along with of course who was going to replace uh Bob Iger and Disney Plus. Jay, why do you like Disney? Well, I look at it from a technical level. This stock had been beaten down for years. We\nfinally  had a nice constructive base and then a breakout above that 200 day moving average, a breakout of a long-term downtrend and then you put all the fundamental stories that the last guest just mentioned. And yeah, this is a recipe where if you want to get in this name, riskreward, there&#39;s much greater reward on the horizon than the risks. Now, we&#39;ll see what the secession line is, but uh something tells me Iger is going to do this one a little bit better than he did the last time he left Disney. and uh that shareholders that have been holding on are\n\nthe valuation of equal weight relative to cap weight is one standard deviation below the mean. Your money is going to be made finding those things that have been hit hardest by tariffs. Worst case scenario, no longer worst case scenario. these things can double over the next two, three, four years. Okay. Yeah. \n### MEDIA_APPEARANCE_RECAP\nI want to get your take on this tax bill, right? Um and the way that I&#39;ve been sort of thinking about it is that if this didn&#39;t happen, it would be a big problem for the markets. Yeah. It happening doesn&#39;t seem to necessarily be a big catalyst because it&#39;s expected or what do you think would be in there that would that could move the needle more? I think it will move the needle once it&#39;s done. It&#39;s going to be pushed through with record like yes they got well relief corporate tax rates earning the impact on earnings power the impact on the consumer having more money. Uh so this is well but they they&#39;re not going to have more money than they do now. Right. Waitresses are look uh no tax on tips. You you got corporate tax rate. You&#39;ve got um we we&#39;re basically shifting now from the apocalypse into growth and deregulation. Growth and deregulation is the happy place. Okay. So, welcome to the happy place. We&#39;re now focused on growth. Companies can start to invest. The tax bill is one more uh cherry on the on the cake. Uh and and this is going to be the second half theme. So, when Trump says stocks are going a lot higher, first off, his first tweet was right, okay, on April 9th. His second tweet last week when people were nervous before the UK deal was right. Yesterday, he&#39;s in Saudi Arabia saying stocks are going a lot higher. Um th this is one of the few regions of the world right now that has an explicit growth program on the plate. Deregulation, tax cuts, billions upon billions, trillions of dollars investment in the United States incentivized for these businesses going that&#39;s going to create a huge amount of jobs. And if you remember Trump 1.0, guys who run money like me, we did okay. It was a good four years, a lot of volatility. We ended up fine. Okay. everyday people, middle-class working pa class people. If you look at the employment rate, real word wages, they did better than ever. And I think you&#39;re going to see that cubed in this Trump 2.0. I think you&#39;re going to see the middle class, the upper middle class, the lower class, working class do exceptionally well. I think, by the way, it&#39;s interesting. I think you&#39;re going to see a continued outperformance of international stocks even despite all of this growth programs. US stocks are going to do great. International stocks are going to start to do well. It&#39;s it&#39;s a cycle that happens every 10 to 15 years. We started it in the first quarter of this year.\n### MEDIA_APPEARANCE_RECAP\nWhen volatility ticks up you buy CBOE that&#39;s a no-brainer. Uh volatility huge crush in the last four weeks. Uh so their revenues are going to be a little bit lighter. Double downgrade it&#39;s a little aggressive. It&#39;s such a great business. It&#39;s got kind of a monopoly in the space. So, I think longterm it&#39;s okay. I think short short term I actually like the sellside call, which I don&#39;t say very often. Oh, interesting. Okay. Um, and then also we&#39;re looking at New Holdings. That&#39;s the holding company for New Bank. Um, and watching that stock. It&#39;s a Brazilian digital lender here. Um, and uh, it posted a slight miss in its adjusted profit for the first quarter. The company did see strong revenue growth of 40% year-over-year during the quarter, but higher spending on new clients dragged on its profit. The shares were down before. Now they&#39;ve turned higher by a little more than 1%. It&#39;s among the most valuable lenders in Latin America. Warren Buffett&#39;s Birkshire Hathaway is among its shareholders. That&#39;s usually Tom&#39;s mood music uh when he hears that kind of thing. Um we&#39;ve talked to the company before and it really has seen big growth. We also recently talked to Marcato Libre, another fintech and e-commerce company that&#39;s big in Latin America and the theme that they emphasize over and over again is just adoption. In other words, they&#39;re much, you know, they&#39;re not as far along as we are here in the US with everyone on devices, shopping, banking online, and so there&#39;s a lot of upside. Yeah. Well, uh, I got rich investing in South American banks is something no one&#39;s ever said. I I will say this, look, they&#39;re growing customers. They&#39;ve got a new technology. Buffett owns like a sliver. One of his underlings bought it. Uh, but as far as it goes, what you saw was their credit reserves went up in terms of uh expecting bad losses. And this is the same story over and over in Latin America. Brazil hasn&#39;t benefited from the international outperformance because of the political climate. So you really need to see a change in political regime. They&#39;re expanding into Colombia. That&#39;s weighing on cost. They&#39;re expanding into Mexico. So they have to invest a lot. This thing has been kind of dead money for years. Everyone said, &quot;Well, Buffett bought it. It&#39;s going to be great.&quot; Well, Buffett didn&#39;t buy it. His his underlings did. And um I I it wouldn&#39;t surprise me if they do get the growth, if they get the momentum, if all the ingredients come together. Uh but it&#39;s not there yet. So, for me, it&#39;s a pass. Okay. I mean, it&#39;s the stock hasn&#39;t I don&#39;t know. I guess it has. It is. It had a big run up and now it hasn&#39;t. That&#39;s why we&#39;re talking about it. Yeah, I guess so. Um, and let&#39;s talk about Uber offering a billion dollars of exchangeable notes tied to shares of self-driving truck company Aurora. Aurora was Aurora was one of the first autonomous vehicle startups to go public, a listing it achieved in 2021. Uber was the company and is the company&#39;s largest shareholder. Couldn&#39;t sell its shares for four years. Aurora is a really interesting company. We actually had the chance to talk to the C CEO recently. Um, and to be clear, Aurora doesn&#39;t make the cars, the vehicles. It doesn&#39;t even make cars at all. Its software is for self-driving semi-truckss. And it actually is one of the first ones that h actually has um trucks using its software on the roads in Texas. So, that was a big milestone for the company. Uber still owns over 300 million shares of it, 23% of the stock. But what you get is when you get a convertible offering, it can dilute the value for existing shareholders. But still, Aurora kind of an intriguing, you know, we keep talking about Tesla, Whimo, D. I mean, this company, it software is already driving out there. I think this offering is just a way for Uber to raise a billion dollars of cash without selling the stock. Uh, and Aurora doesn&#39;t want to them to dump a billion dollars of stock on the market. So, uh, this is a great way. It converts at a at a 10 to 15% up, uh, into Aurora stock. So that means that stock or into cash. So that means that stock would be pulled away from Uber. So this is, you know, it&#39;s a way for them to monetize that position without destroying the market for Aurora and maintaining that partnership. So I think it&#39;s a smart move by Uber. I think uh Aurora likes it and uh and it&#39;s a bet that this could be the future because we we do need truck drivers and we do need that uh logistics. Are you invested in any kind of autonomous driving? Is that a theme that you&#39;re into? I know you&#39;re sort of more on the value side, so I don&#39;t know if this appeals to you. I think the greatest international value in AI right now and one of our largest positions is called Alibaba. No one wants it. Yeah. No one wants it. It&#39;s up. It&#39;s doubled off the lows. People are still not talking about it because the Republican Senate and House is saying we&#39;re going to delist it again. Every two years we&#39;re going to delist it. So we own it in Hong Kong. They&#39;re going to report earnings tomorrow. Okay, you saw JD. Earnings are going to be good. This is the cheapest way to own AI in the world because not only are their models beating Deep Seek and beating Open AI, but they&#39;re the largest cloud provider. And what they say to all these AI startups in China, every single one of them, we&#39;ll help you out. We&#39;ll give you a free sample. We will give you cloud computing which you need and you can&#39;t afford, you will give us equity. So Alibaba is effectively an AI ETF in China. They own a piece of all the AI startups. So that&#39;s the way I&#39;m playing it. So indirectly, I probably have a lot of autonomous driving, but I have it through something with a huge margin of safety, $80 billion of cash on the balance sheet, generating $20 billion of free cash flow, buying in stock like there&#39;s no no tomorrow, and a leader in AI. So, oh, and by the way, they&#39;re the number one retailer to the middle class. So, as the Chinese push, a little bonus, they&#39;re a toll taker. Um, that was an very adept piv pivot, Tom Hayes, try from autonomous driving Alibaba. stock is up almost 60% over the last year.\n### HEADLINES_AND_NEWS\nlet&#39;s get to some breaking news that was crossing the wire. A wave of deals being announced amid President Trump&#39;s visit to the Middle East. This time it&#39;s Boeing. President Trump saying Boeing has won its largest ever order in the company&#39;s history. Qatar Airways said to have purchased 160 aircraft from the US company. Um, and um, again, Trump saying that this is the total the largest Boeing order in its history. Of course, there&#39;s other some other plane\n\n### MEDIA_APPEARANCE_RECAP\nfinally",
    "QUOTES_OF_THE_WEEK": "\n\n### MEDIA_APPEARANCE_RECAP\n### QUOTES_OF_THE_WEEK\n### MACRO_DATA_SLIDES\n### FEATURED_COMPANY_DEEP_DIVES\n### HEADLINES_AND_NEWS\n### TECHNICAL_CHARTS\n### ASK_ME_ANYTHING_QA\n### MISCELLANEOUS\n\n Yeah. I think for Generrack uh it is seasonal and none of their guidance includes any type of uh extreme events and there&#39;s usually always an extreme event at this time of year. So they don&#39;t put it in. So they could they what we call sandbag. They very conservative on the guidance. Um you know we look we started building that thing. We had a basis below 100. It shot up to 194. It&#39;s come down to 124. It&#39;s not changed our view on the stock. It&#39;s just how it recovers. Thing had a heart attack. You know when you have a heart attack you get off the table. You don&#39;t run a marathon. You go out. You walk around with the pole. You let go of the pole. You think you&#39;re okay. You fall on the floor. or they&#39;re like go back to the poll for a little while. I mean 80% down is a heart attack. Okay. So now they&#39;re walking again with the pole and they&#39;re going to try again and then they&#39;re going to do better. And this happens. It is a very cyclical business because uh in in some of our video cast we&#39;ve gone through the cycles where they have the revenue declines and the cash flow declines and then it starts to reacelerate. But if you look at that slide I did in the last presentation cash flow is nearing record highs and the price the stock price is still down some 80%. This is a uh this is like, you know, Buffett talks about the fat pitch. Wait for the fat pitch. For me, this is a complete no-brainer. Yeah. So, they&#39;ve bought back uh we had we skipped through the slide, but they&#39;ve got 20 billion more on their buyback. They they&#39;ve been buying in tons and tons of stocks for the last few years. They started paying a dividend. They just announced a special dividend. Uh so, we&#39;re not in it for the dividend. It&#39;s nice to see them returning capital. They&#39;re going to continue. They the interesting thing difference between US managers and Chinese managers. The Chinese to their credit were buying every share they could get their hands on below 100 in the hole. Whereas US managers after the stocks up 10x they start b announcing big back by big buybacks so that there&#39;s liquidity for them to sell their own options. And it&#39;s a completely different mindset. So the Chinese buy low and sell high. the uh American managers for the most part when the stock collapses they&#39;re not in the market buying. So we&#39;re happy that they&#39;re doing it and uh their buyback rate is slowing in the 120s which I&#39;m very happy to see. I love that they were buying handover fist in the in the 80s and 70s and they they still have uh 20 billion of authorization and they will use that but um the time to buy for the for the company because they&#39;re stewards of my capital as an owner um was to be buying when when we were buying and uh and and you know I I don&#39;t think we&#39;re going to get material dips from here for them to buy in a huge part of the company. I think from here it&#39;s just going to be it&#39;s just going to keep pushing higher is my general view at this point. Like the pain is in the rear the majority of the pain is in the rearview mirror. I know because I lived it buying on every red day. Um, and now it&#39;s like it&#39;s like that Microsoft chart where it&#39;s just like fundamentals are getting better, but all of a sudden people start to get interested in the stock and all that pen. It&#39;s like holding a beach ball underwater like Gener. How is the cash flow getting so much better and the revenue is starting to improve and the margin starting to expand and the price is still the same as when they had negative cash flow. It&#39;s just you&#39;re holding the beach ball under water and once you let go, it just goes when it comes it comes all at once. That&#39;s the way these turnarounds work. Yes, I met Kathy. Kathy has a house next to our in the town over from our houses in Connecticut. Um, I met her in Tampa. She&#39;s a super sweet woman, like really approachable, nice person. Uh, it&#39;s a different game. I mean, that&#39;s not my lane. So I for me to comment, you know, she&#39;s trying to guess what technologies are going to change the world and she might be right and she might pick one and that&#39;s a thousand bagger and then it will go up. I can&#39;t predict her ability to predict. I can&#39;t even predict. That&#39;s why I don&#39;t predict. I I buy these boring businesses. I can sleep well at night that are quick doubles and triples. So uh I&#39;m the wrong person to ask. But um I hope so. I hope she does great. But uh it&#39;s not not for Ray. Not not what I do. Not not for me. Yeah. What are your thoughts on car manufacturers? General Motors and others are trading wealth. Yeah, great question. I like to buy the arms dealers, not the waring faction. So GM and Ford are going to be a race to the bottom in margins. They&#39;re going to start incentives are going to start going up. Volumes are going to start going up. Race to the bottom. You want to uh play in the companies that benefit from increased volumes and let them deal with the margin compression. Same with the home builders in my opinion. So, uh, that&#39;s how we play it. I think your thinking framework is correct. I just think there are better ways to play that theme. Yeah. All right. Cool. Yeah. Yeah. Um, of those, if you put a gun to my head, I&#39;d own 10 cent for sure. And, uh, if you said you got to own a third, I&#39;d say Muan, but no one has a gun to my head, so I&#39;m just happy owning Alibaba. So, uh, but yeah, I&#39;ve looked at all of them. Yeah. Yes. No, because Brad is one of the few people who can operate a rollup properly. So what he does is he come in comes in into a fragmented business, rolls them up, applies technology. He&#39;s really good at applying technology to get cost synergies. He&#39;s not just like a private equity where he just cuts jobs and hopes that the business keeps running with half the people. um he actually brings value ad operational and synergistic stuff and then scale buying and he&#39;s just done it so many times that he&#39;s one of the few people I would bet on on a rollup because he did it at United Rentals, he did it at Waste Connections, he did it at XBO and he&#39;s just a master of doing this. So um yeah, reasonable concern but wrong guy. Yeah. company. Which guy? Who was Oh, Brad Jacobs has started QXO. It&#39;s a roll up of building supplies to play the housing recovery. Yeah. Cool. All right. Well, thanks for staying a few minutes late. I appreciate it. And uh hope you enjoy. And we&#39;re back. Warren Buffett quote of the week. In the world of business, the people who are the most successful are those who are doing what they love. Uh, no question about it, ladies and gentlemen. I feel like I&#39;m on a treasure hunt every day. Uh, again, Buffett, you don&#39;t need to be a rocket scientist. Investing is not a game where the guy with the 160 IQ beats the guy with the 130 IQ. In fact, it&#39;s often the opposite because the guy with the 160 IQ tends to be more emotional and uh affected by the day-to-day and trying to analyze every\n\nI just think there are better ways to play that theme. Yeah. All right. Cool. Yeah. Yeah. Um, of those, if you put a gun to my head, I&#39;d own 10 cent for sure. And, uh, if you said you got to own a third, I&#39;d say Muan, but no one has a gun to my head, so I&#39;m just happy owning Alibaba. So, uh, but yeah, I&#39;ve looked at all of them. Yeah. Yes.

All right. Well, thanks for staying a few minutes late. I appreciate it. And uh hope you enjoy. And we&#39;re back. ### QUOTES_OF_THE_WEEK Warren Buffett quote of the week. In the world of business, the people who are the most successful are those who are doing what they love. Uh, no question about it, ladies and gentlemen. I feel like I&#39;m on a treasure hunt every day. Uh, again, Buffett, you don&#39;t need to be a rocket scientist. Investing is not a game where the guy with the 160 IQ beats the guy with the 130 IQ. In fact, it&#39;s often the opposite because the guy with the 160 IQ tends to be more emotional and uh affected by the day-to-day and trying to analyze every headlines  rather than just being patient. Like the old study they did in Fidelity, they couldn&#39;t figure out why this one group of retail accounts outperformed every single one of their managers. And what they found after millions in research and time and effort to figure out what was the secret sauce, what they figured out was all the outperforming accounts had an owner that was dead for more than 10 years and the family didn&#39;t know the account existed. So no one sold anything. No one traded anything. It just went up over time, which is what markets do. And then\n\n### QUOTES_OF_THE_WEEK\nfinally , John Templeton, to buy when others are despondently selling and to sell when others are euphorically buying takes the greatest courage but provides the greatest profit. That&#39;s what we try to do here every single week and very grateful for all of you who um uh took this to heart last month and took advantage of the opportunities in April. You&#39;ve been amply rewarded or just sat tight when a lot of people didn&#39;t and a lot of people sold in the hole. That took a lot of courage and you are being rewarded. So kudos to you.

You can find it anywhere you get your podcast or on YouTube is best. And the reason it&#39;s great on YouTube is because I go through 10 20 uh what do we do like 50 pages of data charts, fundamental stuff, macroeconomic stuff every single week. So, if you can see the charts when I&#39;m talking about demographics, if you can see the charts when I&#39;m talking about earnings, it&#39;s it&#39;s helpful. If you listen, it&#39;s great, too. I know people like to exercise and walk around while they do podcast, but you&#39;ll get significantly more value doing it that way. Welcome. Um, we&#39;ll talk about this. I can&#39;t overemphasize these four points and I know I did it in the previous presentation but owing Corning the only thing I have to look at is the balance sheet. So how much cash do they have? How much debt do they have? What&#39;s their free cash flow to service that interest payment? And when do the different debt maturities come due? And if you can get comfortable like by with that you see the free cash flow trends are pretty stable then yeah it&#39;s a home run. You might even buy a few more shares at that level as well.

Like during COVID, which which forces them as buyers on every positive headline and according to Bessant, there's going to be many deals announced. Very hard to get bearish into that. Prime Book, US single stocks, positive value equals a ton of record short covering here, ladies and gentlemen. Just like you saw at the end of 2022, early 2023, time to be a buyer, not a seller. The shorts are the first buyers. Then the natural buyers come in, then the forced buyers come in. S&P 500 sectors announced buybacks. We talked about record announcements, 665 billion last week, year to date. Infoch, financials, communication services, consumer discretionary. You can't give away consumer discretionary. They're announcing a lot of buybacks and doing a lot of buybacks. More clues that the lows are in for 2025. We covered this on a different chart. Ryan Dietrich also put it out. Performance after 55% of components make a 20-day high 1970 to current shows very positive returns. Option sentiment remains bearish on the dollar. As I said, now that everyone's getting bearish, we probably get a counter trend bounce before we resume the secular trend lower. US earnings revision momentum turns positive. Gage showed renewed optim optimism after 6 months of negative readings. Okay, so that's a positive thing to start to see. Midcap forward earnings relative to small cap going up. Bulls are built on the shoulders of bears. You can see these big bull markets and the kind of short-term draw down. So which we just had a bare market draw a 20% draw down and now we are in bull market as the markets recovered. NASDAQ over 20% and the other indices following suit some of the European indices at all-time highs. World percentage of equity indices above 50-day moving average. This is what you see coming out of a trough in fall of 2023. That's a good thing. That first abrupt move upward. non- US markets while cheap relative to the US are not particularly inexpensive relative to their own history. China again being the lowest emerging markets, United Kingdom, that's where there's some serious opportunity there. Another rare and bullish signal. S&P performance after 60% of components make a 20-day new high. 12 months out, up 9% on average, 10.4% medium. When Degraph and Zwag breath thrusts occur. When Degraph and Zwag breath thrusts occur within one month of each other. Six Six months later, you're up 16% on average. One year later, up 26%. So, a lot of positive things to be looking forward to. Money market mutual funds held by retail and institutions. Lot of dry powder here. Record dry powder impacted Buffett's gifts. Buffett's fortune would have topped Musk's if he hadn't donated shares to charity. He'd be $87 billion wealthier than Elon Musk if he hadn't given away so much. He'd be worth $400 billion. This is the goat, ladies and gentlemen. Never doubt it. Never think it will be replicated. Buffett was and is the greatest of all time. Hedge funds still look to short stocks which it is further buying power for upside on every positive headline. Won't be straight up will be fits and starts. Upside is the direction. Like I said months ago, welcome to Trump 2.0. Same as Trump 1.0. New volatility, new tweet, new volatility resolves to the upside over time. The share of those who carry credit card balances is below 2019 levels for all income groups. The c customer balance sheet is still good. Flows into Europe are picking up. Opinion follows trend. Loan growth in China expected to soon pick up. As a matter of fact, global M2 money supply, pull it up on Google, is reacelerating. And a lot of that is attributable to China's massive stimulus that's in the pipeline and happening as we speak. And we're seeing it in the numbers. This is S&P 500. Healthcare relative performance is off the charts low. There's opportunities to be had there. We expressed through biotech basket and Baxter for now, but we continue to look for opportunity. Teima. So, you can see a lot of the um a lot of the obesity stocks got hit. You remember when Lily was so hot and I said, \"Ladies and gentlemen, there there's there's competitions coming.\" Just like I said with Nvidia, competition's coming. Um when they get that extreme and that certain Nova Nordis and everything else, they've just been slaughtered. Post election years tend to bottom in early April and rally. So here we are in the seasonality that bodess well all the way into late summer. So let's keep the heat on and stay focused. Then value benefit is so you can see where we are relative to where we should be and it looks like some more strength maybe a little weakness in mid July. Value benefit from broading broadening Q1 broadening has averaged 42% since February 19th. So that's a sign of stocks beating the S&P. That's broadening. That's healthy. That's good for stock pickers like us. United States retail sales year-over-year they soft data they keep saying that the world is ending the hard data they keep spending like there's no tomorrow. United Healthcare Group biggest draw down since 2009. A lot of people keep asking. I think there's no way to have certainty that there wasn't some level of fraud. The question is how much. I think we're close to the levels where you got you could take a coin flip gamble. We're not going to do that. But if it gets to 200 or below and stays there for a little while, we might be interested. I think enough people and institutions got slaughtered in this that it's going to take a while to rebuild a base. So, we're in no rush and we want more information and we're willing to miss it. Healthc care sector relative to S&P 500, the cheapest since 2001. There's opportunity. There's a pony in this pile as they say. High yield credit spreads coming in. Sign of no recession. There was fear in April 7th. That fear has subsided. Overall, Prime Book gross versus net leverage still a lot of room to run for risk on and chasing electricity consumption going through the roof. Comtock resources, how you doing? Alibaba cloud year-on-year revenue growth up 18% year-on-year. Look at the acceleration not just in the absolute revenue but in the pace at which the revenue is growing fueled by uh being number one in cloud services fueled by AI products and just be beginning. Mike Zucardi Bank of America over 70% of survey respondents plan on vacationing this summer. A higher percentage than last year's survey. Good thing to do if you believe the world is coming to an end. uh but uh your actions do not reflect it and we focus on actions not words. Four-year cycle for 2025 we're following right along TAC which again points to strength all the way into uh early August with a little bit of bumpiness in June. This has been our framework since the beginning of the year. We didn't expect the magnitude of the draw down. We were looking for buckle up buttercup February March 8 to 10% pullback. We got Liberation Day and we used it to our advantage. You got to play the cards you're dealt, not the cards you want and we played that uh like like an absolute World Series of Poker Champion in April and uh we're excited and uh you played right along with us and uh that's that's just absolutely amazing. Breath of Earnings suggests Bed should be in a cutting phase. We agree too late. Powell is a real thing. He's 150 basis points too restrictive percent of S&P 500 members above the 50-day moving average now at 75% abrupt short covering. Now we get into the chase phase. Magnificent 7 mirroring Nifty50 performance. Uh I don't love these analogs but it's worth noting pockets of it for sure. XLV after 52- week low and positive close a year out. That's the health care sector up on average 21%. Got to be focused on health care right now. Concentration of S&P 500 market cap and earnings in the 10 largest index constituents. The market cap uh is 37% share of the S&P 500 while the earnings are only 30%. These numbers have a tendency to converge. Which is why we said uh before the draw down of mag 7 that mag 7 was going to correct. That was go back to all of our podcasts in uh the last quarter of last year. They certainly did and everyone said it was tariffs but most of them are unaffected by tariffs. So what actually wasn't? it was the fact that their earnings growth decelerated from 33% to 15% ballpark and um and their multiple still hasn't come down commensurate with that reduction in earnings power. Therefore, we do think that while they will bounce and maybe trade as a group back to the top of the range, the real opportunity is going to be in the 493 uh and these will continue to underperform relative to the indices. That doesn't mean crash. That doesn't mean tech wreck of 2000 or 2022. It means underperform relative to the unmagnificent 493 as a basket. Gap between mag 7 and 493 earnings growth is expected to narrow. 36% earnings growth last year, 15% this year. Unmnificent 4% last year, moving up to 13%. The euro's had its best year-to- date gain since 2020. Dollar weakening, euro gaining. People are starting to get excited, which means um we'll have a short-term pause. Retail market share reached 36% in late April on low market volume. Tariff estimates keep sliding. Went all the way up to 28% now down to 14%. Probably nets out around 10% give or take. Plus the non-tariff barriers is going to be the whole name of the game particularly as it relates to China opening their market. biggest six weeks VIX percent declines and forward S&P total returns. So on average uh you're looking at five years out 92% return average one year out 20.8 uh and uh we are in that neighborhood. What did we have here? Uh goodness. Wow. The biggest VIX crush. So if you look at some of these others, they were up 46% a year out. But anyway, the point is the mean a year out is 20%. When you get the VIX collapse off such high levels, S&P 500 one-year forward returns after the last 58% of the S&P 500 stocks hit a four new four-week high. You can see on average 16.1%. Lot of positivity, almost 100% positivity ratio, if not 100% exactly. smaller share of homes built in 2010s than any decade since 1940s. You know what happened next? The game was on. We're going to talk, we talked about in that presentation uh at the money show the reasons why that's going to be taking place. US versus foreign stock fund performance. Foreign large blend is up 12.6% year-to date. US large blend is up 6 12% outperformance of international versus US. That's going to continue. The last time you had that divergence, you had seven years of international outperformance. Prime Book US Energy uh weekly net flows that people are starting to uh nibble around energy stocks. Magnificent 7 PE premium versus the 493 has come back to uh 43% premium, but the earnings growth again still probably doesn't justify it. That's why I think it trades back up to the highs, but it probably as a basket uh stalls out. What if you panic sold and missed April 9th? Uh you're still down 9% versus flat. Or if you listen to this podcast, you're up a ton. Okay, that's the bottom line. Uh, and if you were on that client call that we did, you're up a lot more than a ton. Housing inventory active listing count in Florida. So, Florida tends to be a leading indicator and you're seeing a lot of supply in Florida and you're seeing price declines in a lot of pockets of Florida. So, we're keeping a close eye on that. That should could help. Affordability. Consumers don't believe break evens or CPI. University of Michigan. A lot of these data have been coming in by political party. The Republicans think there's no inflation, the Democrats think it's 6%. So, the truth is actually probably right in the middle like everything else. Hong Kong equities surged for a fourth consecutive month in April, reaching 166 billion Hong Kong dollars, well above historical average. While momentum remains strong, easing US China tensions and yuan stabilization. May temper May inflow signaling a potential pause in the capital shift toward Hong Kong. So, we saw a little bit of that. I think that's goes right back on based on they uh lowered rates again for the first time in 7 months. The Chinese, they're going to keep the pedal to the metal. Sector fund inflows going back into technology in the short term. Financials again, I think top of the range is where that targets. Equity positioning across sectors. Utilities is overweight. Materials is underweight. We like Albamaro there. Demographics are a tailwind to housing demand. We can't overemphasize that. Go to hedge fundtips.com get the slide deck. When you go to the article of the week, which is Baba back in business, you will see the slide deck there. No, this is not another rally. S&P performance after 19% in 27 trading days has average another 9.2% up in the next 12 months. Atlanta GDP now is for the this quarter. Q2 is 2.3 or 2.5% give or take which means no recession. We got negative GDP although it was inventory affected pull forward uh in Q1. You still don't want two consecutive quarters of negative GDP growth. Look at all the Dubai buildings in the background. Pretty cool. And then NASDAQ compositive change in the three years after Netscape release versus CH GPT release. So you had a shakeout. This implies that we got more to go. They're doing an analog bespoke Paul Hickeyy's uh kind of trying to show that there's a lot more upside. We agree NASDAQ composite change in the 5 years after Netscape released versus chat GPT release. These analoges are worth noting but not worth betting the ranch on. But I do think there's a lot of runway. Roaring 2000s is nent. We're halfway through. US households buy highest price home they can afford. um house price. Yeah, and that's the problem. The median house is in the 400s and most people can't afford it. Funding spreads, professional investor positioning, average funding spread, S&P level. So, [Music] um this will chase up GS social media economic sentiment index university. So, Goldman Sachs sentiment is high. The University of Michigan is very low. These are divergences. This is start looking a lot like hard data versus soft data. We think that the soft data will catch up to the hard data as opinion follows trend. Net retail net imbalance before 12:30 p.m. Very high. I'm not sure what the use of that chart is. The median age of all home buyers is now 56 years old, up from 31 in 1981. How are they going to solve for this? Get the deck.

Counter trend bounce, get the Johnny come lately, resume the downtrend like you saw in the first part of the century from 2000 to 2007. Global energy, nobody wants to touch energy with managers at a record low net 35% underweight to the sector. Expectations for a soft landing rebounded 61% up from just 37% in last month&#39;s survey. and five recession expectations appear to have peaked even before the US China tariff agreement was announced only 1% of May FMS investors now see a global recession likely down from 42% in April\n### FEATURED_COMPANY_DEEP_DIVES\nAlibaba update uh what you can see here they said they were going to invest in cash flow but look what&#39;s happening with revenues uh revenues keep going up margins are going back up return on invested capital is going up cash flow down because they&#39;re investing to be number to stay number one and to win the AI race which is the cheapest global AI play with the most possible upside.

Global energy, nobody wants to touch energy with managers at a record low net 35% underweight to the sector.\n### FEATURED_COMPANY_DEEP_DIVES\nAlibaba update uh what you can see here they said they were going to invest in cash flow but look what&#39;s happening with revenues uh revenues keep going up margins are going back up return on invested capital is going up cash flow down because they&#39;re investing to be number to stay number one and to win the AI race which is the cheapest global AI play with the most possible upside. The core of our thesis is one a proxy for Chinese AI and two the toll taker for the middle class recovery pivot toward consumption $20 trillion of savings. Part of what makes Alibaba so unique is it&#39;s essentially the only company in the world, let alone in China, that have both. Number one, a marketleading cloud position and number two, a marketleading in-house large language model, Quen 2.4. Then there&#39;s Alibaba, number one leader in China with 36% of cloud share in the Quen 3 model, which is the world&#39;s largest open-source model family and a top performer globally. The bottom line is Baba is firing on all cylinders and the beach ball hasn&#39;t even broken the surface yet. Management returned 16.5 billion to shareholders in fiscal year 25 including 4.6 billion in dividends at $2 per ads and 11.9 billion in share buybacks which reduced the share count by 5.1%. For Baba&#39;s largest segment, AI related product revenue reached its seventh consecutive quarter of tripledigit year-over-year growth. Stock-based compensation, which Ali used Alibaba used to hand out like candy, was just 473 million this year, down 52% year-over-year.\n\nfinally shifted toward long-term cash incentives backed by a $50 billion net cash position. It&#39;s a move we&#39;ve long preferred. ### FEATURED_COMPANY_DEEP_DIVES\nAlibaba AIDC came in slightly below expectations with revenue growth of 22% year-over-year to 4.63 billion. Most importantly, management remains on track to achieve quarterly profitability for the segment in fiscal year 2026 as they work toward profitability at scale for one of the company&#39;s largest overall segments. All other loss generating segments continue to improve with losses narrowing year-over-year. Free cash flow for the quarter was only 516 million down 76. But this was largely intentional and mainly due to increased cloud infrastructure spending. Cash provided by operating activities was nearly $4 billion 3.8 billion during the quarter up 18% year-over-year which supports this explanation. During the quarter, management continued to monetize non-core assets with the sale of Sun Art and in time expected to generate $2.6 billion in cash proceeds.\nEstee Lauder quick update. You can see the cash flows uh and stock price seem to have bottomed out. Price follows cash flow. They&#39;re implementing the turnaround plan with cost cuts and uh and this is a play on the China recovery. Morning Star put out a note citing the stock is extremely cheap. Bottom line, we maintain our 120 per share fair value estimate for wide mode Estee Lauder.

So that&#39;s a double from here give or take uh and probably a lot more when China turns around. ### MACRO_DATA_SLIDES\nFear and greed is starting to tick up.

Uh you can go back to our podcast if you go to youtube.com type in hedge fund tips with Tom Hayes. Just pick a date. You can see what we were saying. And our big theme was get out of MAG7. Okay. And we started to do so last summer. Um why? Not because of some technical chart because earnings were decelerating and they were fully priced. Okay, so their earnings growth the last two years have been over 30%. Uh 36% it&#39;s dropping to 16% this year and 18% while the rest of the market the unmagnificent 493 the earnings growth is accelerating. So what would you rather have? A group of stocks whose earnings growth rate is cut in half and the multiple is twice the market or a group of stocks where the earnings growth is accelerating and the multiple on those earnings is below the market. The former or the latter? The latter, right? Okay. More earnings growth, less money. That&#39;s what we did and that&#39;s what you absolutely saw uh the first quarter huge outperformance S&amp;P lags. So you had uh you also had an outperformance both of the unmagnificent 493 to the magnificent 7 and you had a massive outperformance of international over US stocks. Okay. The last time you saw that uh you had a period of seven years of dramatic outperformance. You also saw an outperformance of value versus growth and that&#39;s going to continue. We&#39;ve had a bounce in tech in the last few weeks. Uh our view based on underlying earnings, they can trade to the top of the range, but I think the real money is going to be made under the surface in the unmagnificent 493 in international relative to US and in value relative to growth. And uh that was a very unpopular opinion in the third and fourth quarter. As Rob knows, he&#39;s been listening to the podcast for three years. Give stand up. Give him a hand. Rob has been uh so uh came out to see us. And the other thing you have to keep in mind, and I shared with it yesterday, zero interest rate policy was the exception, not the rule. So the last 15 years, everything that&#39;s worked has been all about growth over value. In a normalized environment, uh, anything when the 10-year yield is over 3%. Value outperforms growth 76% of the time. When the 10-year yield is over 4% like it is right now, value outperforms growth 86% of the time. And as I shared on the panel yesterday, over the last since 1927, basically last h 100red years, value even including the aberration of the last 15 years, value has outperformed growth by 4.4% per year. So if you put in a million in value and a million in growth in 1927, you have 68 million more dollars by having chosen value over growth. And basically it&#39;s because you avoid the huge draw downs like the nifty50 crash in the 70s, like the tech wreck in the 2000s, like the mini tech wreck in 2022. Anyone remember that? Few of you. Okay. Um Okay. So we we&#39;re seeing a record rotation out of US stocks into international. The last time you saw that type of rotation out, huge outperformance for the next seven years. So we&#39;ll get fits and starts here in the beginning. But this is a real trend and this is a function of what you&#39;ll also see is the weakness in the dollar persist in line with this value out outperform growth mag 7 to lag seven. You can see the earnings growth on the chart on the right side from 36% earnings growth last year. The other 493 stocks was only 4%. This year that&#39;s cut in half. So if the earnings growth decelerates cuts in half, does it make sense that the stocks went down? Of course. Okay, that&#39;s the most important thing. And people say all the mag 7 was down because of tariffs. Most of them are actually unaffected by tariffs. Okay, if you look business by business. So it has to do with earnings growth. And what&#39;s happened? The unmagnificent 493 had 4% earnings growth last year. They&#39;re up to 8% this year, 13% next year. So their earnings growth is going up, multiples down, that&#39;s starting to go up, etc. So you want to skate to where the puck is going, not the ones that are in the headline that have already gone up 5x that people are saying now is the time to buy. The ones that no one&#39;s paying attention to. The best example of that this year was Boeing. No one talked about Boeing. No one wanted to touch Boeing at 12 four or five weeks ago was $129. I mean, we couldn&#39;t buy it fast enough. I mean, we did a special call with clients. We said, &#39;We haven&#39;t asked you to send in money since October 2022. Okay, that was the bottom of the tech wreck when you couldn&#39;t give away tech stocks. And for those of you who think I only buy boring old manufacturing businesses, you know what we were buying handover fist in October 2022 when no one wanted it? This little company called Amazon. Okay. When you it was it was marked down 50%, you couldn&#39;t give it away. Another company called Alphabet Google. Okay. So, I&#39;m pro tech at the right price in the right way. Uh and we got out of those last summer. Uh and um so, you know, and they basically done nothing ever since with with the recent draw down.\n### HEADLINES_AND_NEWS\nNow, here&#39;s the new theme. This is what you guys have been waiting for. We&#39;ve gone from conceptual to pragmatic. Here&#39;s something that you will never hear outside this room. Second half US housing revival. Okay, this is the farthest thing from truth. Uh they continue to underperform with sentiment at multi-year lows. We we see this as overdone with several catalysts ahead. Lower rates. You&#39;re like, how are we going to get lower rates? We just had a credit downgrade last night. Who saw that? Okay. Uh people were asking me what&#39;s going to happen Monday morning. I was like, I don&#39;t know. All I know is the businesses in my portfolio, their free cash flow is going to be the same. Their revenues is are going to be the same. Their earnings power is going to be the same. Uh so I don&#39;t I don&#39;t spend a lot of time on that. Uh and what we&#39;ve seen in the past the last two times kind of like you get a little dip and then it&#39;s fine. So we view this as a long-term opportunity and highlight three picks picks and shovel plays to express the theme. Why aren&#39;t we just buying home builders if we&#39;re so excited about this theme? Uh, we like to buy the arms dealers, not the waring factions. The waring factions beat themselves up. As this thesis plays out, you&#39;re going to see a massive volume of new starter homes produced, which is going to create excess supply, the exact opposite of what we have right now, which is a der of supply. And you&#39;re going to see incentives, you&#39;re going to see margin compression, you&#39;re going to see big volume. And we&#39;re going to talk about how do we get to that position. So at the current pace of construction, it would take seven and a half years to close the multi-million dollar home deficit, which is about four or five million homes. Um decade plus of underbuilding has pushed the median age of owner occupied homes to 41 years from 31 in 20 uh 2005. 48% of the new housing stock dates back to of the US housing stock dates back to the 1980s or earlier. So, we have an old housing stock. We have a limited housing stock and uh we need to build four to seven million homes very very quickly. So, how how&#39;s that going to happen? First off, mortgage rates are easing. Okay, so they peaked at seven and change. They&#39;re now down, you know, six and a half or so, but the uh 7.79, highest in 23 years. Today, they&#39;re at 6.76. And they&#39;ve been rangebound between six and a half and seven for the past six months. Now, um part of that is people are stuck in low mortgages. That&#39;s affecting supply. Uh when rates approach 6% in late 2024, we saw 18 consecutive weeks of positive purchase applications. Okay, so now we&#39;ve come back up. So, how do we get mortgage rates down? Well, Secretary Bashan, our Treasury Secretary, made it clear. Okay, he his objective is to lower the 10-year yield. What are mortgage rates priced off of? It&#39;s not priced off the Fed funds rate. It&#39;s priced off the 10-year yield because it&#39;s a longer duration loan. And how he&#39;s going to do that is he&#39;s going to exempt governmentbacked securities from the SLR. And he believes that will lower the 10-year yield by 30 to 70 basis points. And we expect this to happen in the second half of the year. So, if you take the 10-year yield down 30 to 70 basis points, which would basically be 375 to 350, you get a 30-year fixed mortgage. I know this is going to blow your mind, uh, below 6%. And if you get a 30-year fixed mortgage at five and change in the next 12 months, the demand for housing is going to be something like we have never seen in our lifetimes because everyone has been priced out. Everyone&#39;s been waiting. And then you couple that with you&#39;re going to start to see an increase of supply. 1982 40% of the new homes were entry level under,400 square foot house. Uh by 2023 that dropped to 9%. And how are they going to get more supply? Those colored areas on the map are federal lands that there&#39;s currently no construction on. Trump is going to open up a portion of those lands to construct starter homes. So you get your 1500 foot house from KB Homes with your 5.9% mortgage and an endangered elk in your backyard free of charge. Okay. It&#39;s going to be awesome. Um, so he&#39;s also cut red tape. That&#39;s a top priority under this administration. He&#39;s terminated the AFFH rule. He&#39;s restored local control and removed local zoning tax. In 2022, 83% of uh delays were attributed to permitting issues. They are going to destroy the red tape and make it easier and easier for companies to build, to buy land, and to build quickly. The administration is focused on another key solution. Opening portions of the 640 million acres of federal land for large-scale housing development. Roughly 47 million acres where 7.3% of federal land fall within metropolitan areas. Everyone thinks it&#39;s only in the middle of nowhere. Uh where more housing is needing needed. And the AEI estimates that if we just unlock, forget 640 million acres, if we just unlock 512,000 acres in the metro areas and outside areas, that could support the construction of 3 million new homes. Okay. Now, if you&#39;re going to build three million new homes, uh demographics, you know about the millennials, they all need houses. They&#39;re all starting families. We won&#39;t go into that.\n### FEATURED_COMPANY_DEEP_DIVES\nHere&#39;s pick number one, QXO. This is a Brad Jacobs company. Does anyone know who Brad Jacobs is? Okay. He one guy, the guy who listens to my podcast, uh too, uh he wrote a book, How to make a few billion dollars. He&#39;s made about12 billion and he&#39;s made a lot more for shareholders. He&#39;s starting this QXO. He&#39;s going to roll up building supply companies because he sees this opportunity. Uh we built a position at $13 and change. It&#39;s like 16 now. Over the next five to seven years, we believe this stock goes well above 50, probably 80 to $100. Uh he did XPO logistics and he did United Rentals. Did everyone know United Rentals and Equipment Leasing? Both of those were rollups. If you put a million bucks in United Rentals, you made over 50 million bucks over 20 years. If you put a million in XPO over 10 years, you made about 60 million. Okay, that&#39;s enough to get that coffee going, that caffeine going. Ladies and gentlemen, he&#39;s going to do it again. And by the way, he put 150 million when he did of his own money in XPO. He&#39;s put a billion dollars of his own money in QXO. So, he&#39;s putting his money where his mouth is. He sees this trend. He aims to do 10% of any given industry. It&#39;s an $800 billion industry. 80 billion topline, 10% IBIDA margins. That&#39;s eight billion dollars. You put a 12 10 12 times multiple, you have, you know, conservatively five six bagger, but we think it could be closer to, you know, $100 stock. I think uh that&#39;s that&#39;s how we&#39;re underwriting it. Right now, Beacon is their platform company. It&#39;s a roofing company they just bought. So, they&#39;re in business. Now, they&#39;ll roll up all different types of um arms dealers to the home builders, all types of building supply companies over the next five years. This is one you buy, you tuck away. Not for five minutes, not for five months, five years. Huge multiple on your money. We like it. Second one is Stanley Black &amp; Decker. If you&#39;re going to build houses, what do you need? Tools. They own DeWalt. They own Craftsman. They own Stanley. This one got crushed by COVID over inventoried, inflation, etc. What I can tell you is they&#39;ve taken out the last two years almost $2 billion of business uh of cost.$2 two billion dollars of costs, which equates to about uh it&#39;s about $13 per share on $154 million shares just on the cost savings as they normalize margins. Uh we think that&#39;s worth $200. It&#39;s trading at $71 right now. It&#39;s not going to do it in three months. It&#39;s going to do it in three years as the cycle turns. The operating leverage in this business is insane. When construction volumes go up and and construction turns the corner, this is the business to play because this business has been around since 1843. It&#39;s been through a couple cycles, ladies and gentlemen. 1843. You think it&#39;s going to make it through, you know, made it through the Great Depression, made it through the Great Financial Crisis. You think it&#39;s going to make it through Trump? of course he&#39;s going to make it through Trump because he&#39;s going to make everyone build houses and bring the houses down and and uh bring the cost down, etc. So, we love this play. Uh we think management has done a good job executing in really hard conditions. We love that they they&#39;ve delevered the balance sheet, taken the costs out. So, and we&#39;re seeing now the business inflect revenues start to reacelerate. Margins starting to reacelerate. The last time they got margins to this level, the stock traded at $150 a share. Okay. And the final one is GenerRack, the Kleenex of home standby generators. Okay. No, we&#39;re not going to cure cancer today. We&#39;re not going to guess who&#39;s going to win the AI race, but we&#39;re going to keep your power on so you can run your AI queries through uh Alibaba&#39;s Quinn 2.4 large language model. Uh you can use open AI, too. But uh we&#39;re going to talk about uh a special international play in the breakout room. Uh what is that in 15 minutes, Mike? Yeah, you&#39;re okay. So, you&#39;re gonna like that. The theme of that room is called How the Uninvestable Became Investable. We&#39;re going to talk about some quote unquote currently uninvestable stocks and the actions we took in previous uninvestable stocks and what happened. Okay. Uh so GenerRack is a huge play on the home building. All I can tell you about this one and this is really what I do. I like to look at divergences between price and cash flow because the only reason you give $1 of your money into any business is you expect to get more than $1 back. So if they&#39;re not generating any cash, then your only hope is that another sucker comes behind you and pays more. And that&#39;s nothing more than a hope. And where you can really get hurt is if that hope comes true because as I said at the beginning of the presentation is the gamblers tend to give the money back to the casino. So when you get the high flyers right and you double your money quickly and you don&#39;t know how it happened oftentimes you wind up saying I&#39;m so smart and going into the next thing that you don&#39;t understand and uh and getting hurt. So with this you can see what&#39;s happened. You can see why the price dropped 80%. You see those red bars on the top? That&#39;s negative free cash flow. People were worried about solveny risk. Look what&#39;s happened since they&#39;ve cut cost, increased margin, and the cycles come back. Free cash flow&#39;s gone up. And what hasn&#39;t gone up yet that&#39;s starting to inflect is price. And if you can find businesses where there&#39;s a divergence between either a price has gone up too high and cash flow is negative, that could be a short or price hasn&#39;t gone back up but cash flow has recovered. When they turn, it turns all at once and you make many multiples very very quickly. Uh this is going to be a triple over the next few years. This is another leverage play on the housing recovery inherent demand. So, uh, three super boring plays with super exciting outcomes if you have the patience and you sit tight and watch this play out over the next few years. So,\n\nGenerrack is a huge play on the home building. All I can tell you about this one and this is really what I do.

So,\n### ASK_ME_ANYTHING_QA\nwith that said , I think we&#39;ve got it all. That&#39;s how you can reach me and we&#39;ll take one question or two. Yeah. Building. Yeah, I love it. Owen&#39;s in the house. Yeah, exactly. I think it would be great. Uh I haven&#39;t looked at the underlying fundamentals and and price and all that stuff, but I think anything in that sector, I like the way you&#39;re thinking. Absolutely. Yeah. And by the way, and and the other thing I would think about these type of stocks, when you have a stock like Gener that&#39;s down 75%. Okay. Um, if it goes $5 against you tomorrow, just log in, look at the free cash flow and say, &quot;Ah, in the short term, the market is a voting machine based on emotion. That&#39;s where you get $5 moves.&quot; And you say, &quot;Am I wrong? What does everyone else know?&quot; Nothing. It could be a hedge fund blowing up. It could be a short attack. It could be nothing. Just look at the underlying business. Like if you were going to buy a jersey Mike&#39;s down the street and the guy said, &quot;How much do you want for your business?&quot; you say, &quot;Well, why don&#39;t you show me your books first, and if you&#39;re profitable, I&#39;ll make you an offer.&quot; You know, people do that in normal business. They don&#39;t do it in the stock market. And if you just apply that framework, uh, I think you&#39;re going to see massive success in your investing future. So, uh,\n\nI would strongly suggest that if you didn&#39;t write it down, hedge fun tips with Tom Hayes. You can find it anywhere you get your podcast or on YouTube is best. And the reason it&#39;s great on YouTube is because I go through 10 20 uh what do we do like 50 pages of data charts, fundamental stuff, macroeconomic stuff every single week. So, if you can see the charts when I&#39;m talking about demographics, if you can see the charts when I&#39;m talking about earnings, it&#39;s it&#39;s helpful. If you listen, it&#39;s great, too. I know people like to exercise and walk around while they do podcast, but you&#39;ll get significantly more value doing it that way. Welcome. Um, we&#39;ll talk about this. I can&#39;t overemphasize these four points and I know I did it in the previous presentation but owing Corning the only thing I have to look at is the balance sheet. So how much cash do they have? How much debt do they have? What&#39;s their free cash flow to service that interest payment? And when do the different debt maturities come due? And if you can get comfortable like by with that you see the free cash flow trends are pretty stable then yeah it&#39;s a home run. You might even buy a few more shares at that level as well. Yeah, exactly. Um, you know what? Go to hedge funips.com, click on the contact button, and you will see that you can write in your name and you&#39;ll see click AMA for\n\nmanagement is imperative. Uh we have a company called which we&#39;re not going to talk about today which now we are because you guys stayed the extra hour called VF Corp. Anyone familiar with VF Corp? They&#39;ve been around since 189 something 93 95 125 years. What they have a DNA for doing is buying and selling brands. Okay. So right now the brands in their stable are Northbased, Timberland, Vans, okay, a company called Vans. And Vans has gotten hit extremely hard because they oversupplied during COVID. It was super popular. Everyone bought three pairs of Vans, very similar to Nike with the Air Force Ones. Uh, and then and the Air Jordans. And then it went through three years of decline. They brought in a new CEO. His name is Bracken Daryl. And the thing you need to know about Bracken Daryl, and I&#39;m trying to emphasize this point about management. Bracken Daryl has a background at Proctor and Gamble, at Old Spice. He&#39;s a brand manager. He&#39;s exceptional at it. He came into a little company called Logitech. Okay. And this is the cancer curing products that they made at Logitech. Okay. Complete commodity product. Nothing revolutionary about a mouse or a webcam. He came in when the stock was down 82% just like he came in at BF Corp with the stock down 82%. Uh in the next 10 years it was a 28 bagger. A million dollars became $28 million selling this that you could get anywhere. Why is that a Logitech? Okay. Because he understood branding. He understood operations. He understood supply chain management. He&#39;s a winner. You want to bet on the jockey. So you may say, &quot;Oh, Vans will never come back.&quot; Bracken will bring it back. He&#39;s he&#39;s worked through the channels. Now he&#39;s going to ramp it up. He&#39;s going to start bringing in the creators and the the influencers and the the whole marketing plan. You&#39;re going to see massive action. Northace is a recovery on China. It&#39;s doing well. Timberlin the same thing. So this is the type of bet. So when you&#39;re buying a stock down and what did he do? He sold off Supreme for over a billion dollars to pay down debt to delever the balance sheet. Why? To get multi-year runway to run the turnaround plan and not get stopped out in the meantime. So that&#39;s the type of things that we like to look at. So near-term catalyst, etc. Um, the key with these is the temperament. So, I&#39;m known as Turnaround Tom because I like to buy good businesses when they&#39;re marked down. Uh, but you have to have a certain level of ice in your veins. So, like I I keep going with the the nickname that people gave me, but they&#39;re starting to give me the Iceman name, okay? because they&#39;ve seen me with, you know, stocks down and I&#39;m like, &quot;Yeah, what&#39;s the problem?&quot; People like, &quot;Are you sure we should own this?&quot; And then like four months later, you know, we were buying Vornnado uh during the mini banking crisis. What was that? March of 2023 and they were throwing banks baby out when um Silicon National Bank collapsed and they were throwing out everything with the bathwater. The the last thing you could talk to people about buying is an office read. Okay? I mean, but what did we do? We saw the dislocation and we picked the highest quality business in the most dislocated market. So, if office was going to be destroyed, which there was a compelling case for that to be to happen, which by the way it hasn&#39;t, which was the camp we were in, but we had to assume that it was going to happen, that we weren&#39;t smarter than 99% of the people that said office was over. Who would be left standing? There would be some offices left and what would be left would be the highest quality in the basket and that&#39;s what Hornado owned in New York, all the best locations, etc. And then I could bet on the jockey, Steve Roth, multi-billionaire. Uh, everyone I spoke to that knew him said the same thing. The guy&#39;s like 80. He will not die until his stock is back at all-time highs. I can assure you that. And that&#39;s what I got from and I met this guy uh in 2010 at an idea launch and this guy was no nonsense. You you have to know who you&#39;re betting on is what I&#39;m saying. You need a good quality business, a stable balance sheet to get through the downturn and a good jockey to turn it around. Okay? And the temperament to wait it out. And this temperament comes also. How many of you trade on or invest on margin or leverage? Yeah. So that&#39;s where you get stopped out because if you if you if if a stock is temporarily down 20% against you, you might be down 40%. And you might not be you might have relinquished the decision to someone else called a margin clerk as to whether or not you could continue to have ICE in your veins and stick it through until Bracken Works turns your million bucks into 28 million bucks with nothing break through here at all. or if the margin clerk takes your money and sells your shares down 40% to a guy like me who&#39;s sitting in cash waiting for this for the shares. Okay? So, you want to be on my side of the table, not that side. And the way you guarantee that is very low to zero margin. If you buy these stocks, right, you will make more than enough money. You don&#39;t have to get people who get hurt are people who try to get rich too fast. Okay? When you slow it down and the older you get, I know I look young, the longer my time horizon is, and the wealthier I&#39;ve become. When I was young, I wanted to be on margin. I wanted to get rich and make a million bucks in a week. If I just buy these uh zero day options and the market goes up 5%, I can make up, you know, 10 million, whatever. and you wind up wiped out. And most people don&#39;t make it through that and they&#39;re they&#39;re out. And if they just understood the right principles at the beginning, buy great businesses when they&#39;re at good prices and wait and don&#39;t be on margin. Don&#39;t give your decision to wait to the margin clerk who&#39;s going to make it the decision for you. Small portion that&#39;s okay. Even Charlie liked a little bit of leverage. So, uh, Charlie Munger that is. So, that&#39;s that. That&#39;s temperament. What does uninvestable mean? The term uninvestable is music to our ears. It tells us that an asset or market has become perceived as so uncertain, so risky, and fearful that it&#39;s easier to slap the label uninvestable on it, regardless of the fundamentals or valuation. That&#39;s critical. That&#39;s why Jeff put it in a different color font. Okay. regardless of the fundamentals or valuation just to avoid the scrutiny,\n\n### FEATURED_COMPANY_DEEP_DIVES\nwe did it with Wells Fargo during the pandemic. We went up to 20%. And that was a quick double and we we did it with Baba and now Cooper Standard because it&#39;s gone up 5x has become a huge part of the portfolios. Huge huge. So we have to we have to constantly assess the current weight as these things go up in price. I mean you know Baba has now moved up from 82 basis to 125 and going. So it&#39;s making up bigger and bigger weights over time. So we have to constantly monitor it. But the answer to your question is I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve ever bought a stock on a green day. Yeah. Yeah. Stopped out in terms of what the risk I&#39;m willing to take. Um All right. So this shows revenues cash flow and these are type of things I like to look at. This is just a page from value line and you can see over time what&#39;s happening to the revenues per share, what&#39;s happening to the cash flow per share, what&#39;s happening to the earnings per share. And what&#39;s interesting is if you actually look at that for good businesses that line tends to be like in a bad period it&#39;ll be flat. In a in normal periods, it goes like this and then stock price goes like this around the actual fundamentals of the business. And what we try to do is we try to buy when price is here, but fundamentals are still here. And we try to sell when price is here and everyone&#39;s excited and there&#39;s headlines  and uh people who hated it down here are on stage in the main room loving it up here. You you&#39;ll probably have some people pitching Baba next year at $200. I&#39;ll be if we have a if we have a presentation, if we have a a money show, I would definitely say 18 months from now, there&#39;s going to be a speaker on stage pitching Baba over $200. It will not be me. I&#39;ll be waiting for him to get it over 250 and I will be helping out his audience get as many shares as they like. So, write that down. Put it in your Google calendar. It&#39;s coming to a theater near you. All right, Alibaba, we covered that. All right, I want you to understand this concept is critical. So, we talked about fundamentals versus price. Um, you can buy this stock effectively at 2014 prices. The difference today is that the revenue per share is up, 1100%. The cash flow per share is up 500%, the earnings per share are up 500%. And the stock is effectively flat. The one other stock I can think of that h experienced this type of improved fundamentals with no improvement in price until it all improved at once is Microsoft. Microsoft from 2006 to 2013 they grew revenues by 112%. They grew cash flow per share by almost 200%. And they grew earnings by 120%. The stock did nothing. In the following 10 years, it was up 1500%. And if you look at the fundamentals, everyone says, &quot;Well, Satia, Satia changed the world, blah blah blah.&quot; His improvement in revenue per share, cash flow per share, and earnings per share is not much better than Steve Balmer&#39;s was, except he got multiple expansion, and the stock went up 1500%. And and and that&#39;s what I talk about opinion follows trend. You&#39;re going to see the same thing with Alibaba. You&#39;re going to see the same thing with Cooper. You&#39;re already seeing with Cooper Standard is that when the price goes up a lot, everyone gets excited and they jump on the train. Okay? And the same thing is going to happen. What&#39;s what&#39;s dispondent now? Dispondency turns into euphoria. It&#39;s the extreme. Like Warren Buffett always taught from Ben Graham, the market is a manic depressive. Okay? It&#39;s it&#39;s one day the business is the same. In the short term it&#39;s a voting machine based on emotions. In the long term it&#39;s a weighing machine based on fundamentals. So that manic depressive if you can buy stocks from the market on its depressive days and sell stocks to the market on its euphoria days that&#39;s where you make your bones. Yes ma&#39;am. Yeah. Yeah.

Yeah. But you would have gotten stopped out two or three times before that. That&#39;s why you start with the core position. So as the stock was slowly going up and your options kept expiring, you were making money and you could reload if you wanted to. But if you just do options, right, and you and you get the wrong year or two years, you&#39;re wiped out, right? So you do stock primarily and then add some excess for for some excess returns in the way that you position it based on option pricing volatility and that type of stuff. But your your thinking is correct. But just start with the stock. Don&#39;t try to get rich overnight. Buy the stock. I&#39;m going to own this thing until it reaches intrinsic value.

Uh just to give you an idea, chat GPT is valued at $300 billion in its latest round. Uh that&#39;s the whole market cap of Alibaba. The difference is that Alibaba generated 17.8 billion in net income this year. Uh Open AI is lucky if they do 13 billion of revenues, never mind earnings. Okay, so that&#39;s OpenAI is an example of euphoria. Uh, Alibaba right now is an example still of dispondency. Sell euphoria by dispondency. It&#39;s a good formula. China&#39;s the number one AI global AI play. The most AI you can get for the least amount of money. Their large language models have been proven competitive and better than deepseeek and open AI on many accounts. And for compute, they give all the pretty much every AI startup in China goes through Alibaba, number one cloud player. They say, &quot;We need compute power.&quot; Alibaba says, &quot;No problem. We give it to you for free like every good drug dealer. Give you a free sample.&quot; And then they say, &quot;Just give us equity.&quot; And they have free equity in all the AI startups in China. So it&#39;s almost like an AI ETF by owning Alibaba. Cloud revenue up 18% plus. So all of them are hitting on on uh every cylinders. we like a lot about. You got the e-commerce, you got the uh the cloud compute, you&#39;ve got the AI play, you have uh Tao and T- mall a play on the government initiative to get that $20 trillion of savings circulating. Alibaba is the toll taker. Uh middle class recovery play and for the first time ever, mainland Chinese stocks could buy Alibaba through the stock connect. So, imagine if you&#39;re getting three Amazon boxes at your door for the last 10 years, but the US government said you couldn&#39;t own Alib uh couldn&#39;t own Amazon and all of a sudden they said, you know, that company you&#39;re sending all your money to and they send you boxes. Uh you can own some equity in that company. And that&#39;s exactly what happened. Analyst analysts estimate 20 billion dollars in potential inflows from new buyers. I think we&#39;re at uh already eight billion or something like that just in the last six months. Something like that. So, the game&#39;s just beginning. You&#39;re getting another source of buyers until the foreign buyers start to step in on top of it. Um, by the way, owning China as a pension manager and a large asset manager was like owning energy in 2020. Now, if you if you didn&#39;t own an energy in the last year or so, you underperformed. So, they all all owned energy. So, they sell the bottom, they buy the top. Opinion follows trend. tariff exposure. Less than 1% of Alibaba&#39;s 134 billion in revenue came from the US, so it&#39;s a non-issue. Uh, the D-listing would only hurt Americans. And this is how you contact me.

The core of our thesis is one a proxy for Chinese AI and two the toll taker for the middle class recovery pivot toward consumption $20 trillion of savings. Part of what makes Alibaba so unique is it&#39;s essentially the only company in the world, let alone in China, that have both. Number one, a marketleading cloud position and number two, a marketleading in-house large language model, Quen 2.4. Then there&#39;s Alibaba, number one leader in China with 36% of cloud share in the Quen 3 model, which is the world&#39;s largest open-source model family and a top performer globally. The bottom line is Baba is firing on all cylinders and the beach ball hasn&#39;t even broken the surface yet. Management returned 16.5 billion to shareholders in fiscal year 25 including 4.6 billion in dividends at $2 per ads and 11.9 billion in share buybacks which reduced the share count by 5.1%. For Baba&#39;s largest segment, AI related product revenue reached its seventh consecutive quarter of tripledigit year-over-year growth. Stock-based compensation, which Ali used Alibaba used to hand out like candy, was just 473 million this year, down 52% year-over-year.\n\nrevenues increased 12% in Q4 and are expected to remain strong, driven by the60% 60 basis point software service fee and the expanding use of Quanzan, a merchant advertising tool. The medium-term goal remains stabilizing market share for TTG which currently sits around 40% i.e. 40% of all e-commerce revenues in China go through Alibaba. Management returned 16.5 billion to shareholders in fiscal year 25 including 4.6 billion in dividends at $2 per ads and 11.9 billion in share buybacks which reduced the share count by 5.1%. Management views instant commerce as a huge opportunity is starting to lean into it. The market is expected to grow from 500 to 600 million consumers all the way to a billion over time in China. Early results have far exceeded original expectations as management integrates instant commerce through TTG driving new users as well as increased stick stickiness frequency and overall consumption. These investments will weigh on IBIDA margins in the near term but will be a long-term growth driver for IBIDA&#39;s largest segment.

Most importantly, management remains on track to achieve quarterly profitability for the segment in fiscal year 2026 as they work toward profitability at scale for one of the company&#39;s largest overall segments. All other loss generating segments continue to improve with losses narrowing year-over-year. Free cash flow for the quarter was only 516 million down 76. But this was largely intentional and mainly due to increased cloud infrastructure spending.

Um and the way that I&#39;ve been sort of thinking about it is that if this didn&#39;t happen, it would be a big problem for the markets. Yeah. It happening doesn&#39;t seem to necessarily be a big catalyst because it&#39;s expected or what do you think would be in there that would that could move the needle more? I think it will move the needle once it&#39;s done. It&#39;s going to be pushed through with record like yes they got well relief corporate tax rates earning the impact on earnings power the impact on the consumer having more money. Uh so this is well but they they&#39;re not going to have more money than they do now. Right. Waitresses are look uh no tax on tips. You you got corporate tax rate. You&#39;ve got um we we&#39;re basically shifting now from the apocalypse into growth and deregulation. Growth and deregulation is the happy place. Okay. So, welcome to the happy place. We&#39;re now focused on growth. Companies can start to invest. The tax bill is one more uh cherry on the on the cake. Uh and and this is going to be the second half theme. So, when Trump says stocks are going a lot higher, first off, his first tweet was right, okay, on April 9th. His second tweet last week when people were nervous before the UK deal was right. Yesterday, he&#39;s in Saudi Arabia saying stocks are going a lot higher. Um th this is one of the few regions of the world right now that has an explicit growth program on the plate. Deregulation, tax cuts, billions upon billions, trillions of dollars investment in the United States incentivized for these businesses going that&#39;s going to create a huge amount of jobs. And if you remember Trump 1.0, guys who run money like me, we did okay. It was a good four years, a lot of volatility. We ended up fine. Okay. everyday people, middle-class working pa class people. If you look at the employment rate, real word wages, they did better than ever. And I think you&#39;re going to see that cubed in this Trump 2.0. I think you&#39;re going to see the middle class, the upper middle class, the lower class, working class do exceptionally well. I think, by the way, it&#39;s interesting. I think you&#39;re going to see a continued outperformance of international stocks even despite all of this growth programs. US stocks are going to do great. International stocks are going to start to do well. It&#39;s it&#39;s a cycle that happens every 10 to 15 years. We started it in the first quarter of this year.\n### MEDIA_APPEARANCE_RECAP\nWhen volatility ticks up you buy CBOE that&#39;s a no-brainer. Uh volatility huge crush in the last four weeks. Uh so their revenues are going to be a little bit lighter. Double downgrade it&#39;s a little aggressive. It&#39;s such a great business. It&#39;s got kind of a monopoly in the space. So, I think longterm it&#39;s okay. I think short short term I actually like the sellside call, which I don&#39;t say very often. Oh, interesting. Okay. Um, and then also we&#39;re looking at New Holdings. That&#39;s the holding company for New Bank. Um, and watching that stock. It&#39;s a Brazilian digital lender here. Um, and uh, it posted a slight miss in its adjusted profit for the first quarter. The company did see strong revenue growth of 40% year-over-year during the quarter, but higher spending on new clients dragged on its profit. The shares were down before. Now they&#39;ve turned higher by a little more than 1%. It&#39;s among the most valuable lenders in Latin America. Warren Buffett&#39;s Birkshire Hathaway is among its shareholders. That&#39;s usually Tom&#39;s mood music uh when he hears that kind of thing. Um we&#39;ve talked to the company before and it really has seen big growth. We also recently talked to Marcato Libre, another fintech and e-commerce company that&#39;s big in Latin America and the theme that they emphasize over and over again is just adoption. In other words, they&#39;re much, you know, they&#39;re not as far along as we are here in the US with everyone on devices, shopping, banking online, and so there&#39;s a lot of upside. Yeah. Well, uh, I got rich investing in South American banks is something no one&#39;s ever said. I I will say this, look, they&#39;re growing customers. They&#39;ve got a new technology. Buffett owns like a sliver. One of his underlings bought it. Uh, but as far as it goes, what you saw was their credit reserves went up in terms of uh expecting bad losses. And this is the same story over and over in Latin America. Brazil hasn&#39;t benefited from the international outperformance because of the political climate. So you really need to see a change in political regime. They&#39;re expanding into Colombia. That&#39;s weighing on cost. They&#39;re expanding into Mexico. So they have to invest a lot. This thing has been kind of dead money for years. Everyone said, &quot;Well, Buffett bought it. It&#39;s going to be great.&quot; Well, Buffett didn&#39;t buy it. His his underlings did. And um I I it wouldn&#39;t surprise me if they do get the growth, if they get the momentum, if all the ingredients come together. Uh but it&#39;s not there yet. So, for me, it&#39;s a pass. Okay. I mean, it&#39;s the stock hasn&#39;t I don&#39;t know. I guess it has. It is. It had a big run up and now it hasn&#39;t. That&#39;s why we&#39;re talking about it. Yeah, I guess so. Um, and let&#39;s talk about Uber offering a billion dollars of exchangeable notes tied to shares of self-driving truck company Aurora. Aurora was Aurora was one of the first autonomous vehicle startups to go public, a listing it achieved in 2021. Uber was the company and is the company&#39;s largest shareholder. Couldn&#39;t sell its shares for four years. Aurora is a really interesting company. We actually had the chance to talk to the C CEO recently. Um, and to be clear, Aurora doesn&#39;t make the cars, the vehicles. It doesn&#39;t even make cars at all. Its software is for self-driving semi-truckss. And it actually is one of the first ones that h actually has um trucks using its software on the roads in Texas. So, that was a big milestone for the company. Uber still owns over 300 million shares of it, 23% of the stock. But what you get is when you get a convertible offering, it can dilute the value for existing shareholders. But still, Aurora kind of an intriguing, you know, we keep talking about Tesla, Whimo, D. I mean, this company, it software is already driving out there. I think this offering is just a way for Uber to raise a billion dollars of cash without selling the stock. Uh, and Aurora doesn&#39;t want to them to dump a billion dollars of stock on the market. So, uh, this is a great way. It converts at a at a 10 to 15% up, uh, into Aurora stock. So that means that stock or into cash. So that means that stock would be pulled away from Uber. So this is, you know, it&#39;s a way for them to monetize that position without destroying the market for Aurora and maintaining that partnership. So I think it&#39;s a smart move by Uber. I think uh Aurora likes it and uh and it&#39;s a bet that this could be the future because we we do need truck drivers and we do need that uh logistics. Are you invested in any kind of autonomous driving? Is that a theme that you&#39;re into? I know you&#39;re sort of more on the value side, so I don&#39;t know if this appeals to you. I think the greatest international value in AI right now and one of our largest positions is called Alibaba. No one wants it. Yeah. No one wants it. It&#39;s up. It&#39;s doubled off the lows. People are still not talking about it because the Republican Senate and House is saying we&#39;re going to delist it again. Every two years we&#39;re going to delist it. So we own it in Hong Kong. They&#39;re going to report earnings tomorrow. Okay, you saw JD. Earnings are going to be good. This is the cheapest way to own AI in the world because not only are their models beating Deep Seek and beating Open AI, but they&#39;re the largest cloud provider. And what they say to all these AI startups in China, every single one of them, we&#39;ll help you out. We&#39;ll give you a free sample. We will give you cloud computing which you need and you can&#39;t afford, you will give us equity. So Alibaba is effectively an AI ETF in China. They own a piece of all the AI startups. So that&#39;s the way I&#39;m playing it. So indirectly, I probably have a lot of autonomous driving, but I have it through something with a huge margin of safety, $80 billion of cash on the balance sheet, generating $20 billion of free cash flow, buying in stock like there&#39;s no no tomorrow, and a leader in AI. So, oh, and by the way, they&#39;re the number one retailer to the middle class. So, as the Chinese push, a little bonus, they&#39;re a toll taker. Um, that was an very adept piv pivot, Tom Hayes, try from autonomous driving Alibaba. stock is up almost 60% over the last year.\n### HEADLINES_AND_NEWS\nlet&#39;s get to some breaking news that was crossing the wire. A wave of deals being announced amid President Trump&#39;s visit to the Middle East. This time it&#39;s Boeing. President Trump saying Boeing has won its largest ever order in the company&#39;s history. Qatar Airways said to have purchased 160 aircraft from the US company.

Um, and um, again, Trump saying that this is the total the largest Boeing order in its history. Of course, there's other some other plane\n### HEADLINES_AND_NEWS\n\n### HEADLINES_AND_NEWS\n\ntheme entering 2025 last we anticipated a big rotation coming into 2025. Uh you can go back to our podcast if you go to youtube.com type in hedge fund tips with Tom Hayes. Just pick a date. You can see what we were saying. And our big theme was get out of MAG7. Okay. And we started to do so last summer. Um why? Not because of some technical chart because earnings were decelerating and they were fully priced. Okay, so their earnings growth the last two years have been over 30%. Uh 36% it&#39;s dropping to 16% this year and 18% while the rest of the market the unmagnificent 493 the earnings growth is accelerating. So what would you rather have? A group of stocks whose earnings growth rate is cut in half and the multiple is twice the market or a group of stocks where the earnings growth is accelerating and the multiple on those earnings is below the market. The former or the latter? The latter, right? Okay. More earnings growth, less money. That&#39;s what we did and that&#39;s what you absolutely saw uh the first quarter huge outperformance S&amp;P lags. So you had uh you also had an outperformance both of the unmagnificent 493 to the magnificent 7 and you had a massive outperformance of international over US stocks. Okay. The last time you saw that uh you had a period of seven years of dramatic outperformance. You also saw an outperformance of value versus growth and that&#39;s going to continue. We&#39;ve had a bounce in tech in the last few weeks. Uh our view based on underlying earnings, they can trade to the top of the range, but I think the real money is going to be made under the surface in the unmagnificent 493 in international relative to US and in value relative to growth. And uh that was a very unpopular opinion in the third and fourth quarter. As Rob knows, he&#39;s been listening to the podcast for three years. Give stand up. Give him a hand. Rob has been uh so uh came out to see us. And the other thing you have to keep in mind, and I shared with it yesterday, zero interest rate policy was the exception, not the rule. So the last 15 years, everything that&#39;s worked has been all about growth over value. In a normalized environment, uh, anything when the 10-year yield is over 3%. Value outperforms growth 76% of the time. When the 10-year yield is over 4% like it is right now, value outperforms growth 86% of the time. And as I shared on the panel yesterday, over the last since 1927, basically last h 100red years, value even including the aberration of the last 15 years, value has outperformed growth by 4.4% per year. So if you put in a million in value and a million in growth in 1927, you have 68 million more dollars by having chosen value over growth. And basically it&#39;s because you avoid the huge draw downs like the nifty50 crash in the 70s, like the tech wreck in the 2000s, like the mini tech wreck in 2022. Anyone remember that? Few of you. Okay. Um Okay. So we we&#39;re seeing a record rotation out of US stocks into international. The last time you saw that type of rotation out, huge outperformance for the next seven years. So we&#39;ll get fits and starts here in the beginning. But this is a real trend and this is a function of what you&#39;ll also see is the weakness in the dollar persist in line with this value out outperform growth mag 7 to lag seven. You can see the earnings growth on the chart on the right side from 36% earnings growth last year. The other 493 stocks was only 4%. This year that&#39;s cut in half. So if the earnings growth decelerates cuts in half, does it make sense that the stocks went down? Of course. Okay, that&#39;s the most important thing. And people say all the mag 7 was down because of tariffs. Most of them are actually unaffected by tariffs. Okay, if you look business by business. So it has to do with earnings growth. And what&#39;s happened? The unmagnificent 493 had 4% earnings growth last year. They&#39;re up to 8% this year, 13% next year. So their earnings growth is going up, multiples down, that&#39;s starting to go up, etc. So you want to skate to where the puck is going, not the ones that are in the headline that have already gone up 5x that people are saying now is the time to buy. The ones that no one&#39;s paying attention to. The best example of that this year was Boeing. No one talked about Boeing. No one wanted to touch Boeing at 12 four or five weeks ago was $129. I mean, we couldn&#39;t buy it fast enough. I mean, we did a special call with clients. We said, &#39;We haven&#39;t asked you to send in money since October 2022. Okay, that was the bottom of the tech wreck when you couldn&#39;t give away tech stocks. And for those of you who think I only buy boring old manufacturing businesses, you know what we were buying handover fist in October 2022 when no one wanted it? This little company called Amazon. Okay. When you it was it was marked down 50%, you couldn&#39;t give it away. Another company called Alphabet Google. Okay. So, I&#39;m pro tech at the right price in the right way. Uh and we got out of those last summer. Uh and um so, you know, and they basically done nothing ever since with with the recent draw down.\n### HEADLINES_AND_NEWS\nNow, here&#39;s the new theme. This is what you guys have been waiting for. We&#39;ve gone from conceptual to pragmatic. Here&#39;s something that you will never hear outside this room. Second half US housing revival. Okay, this is the farthest thing from truth. Uh they continue to underperform with sentiment at multi-year lows. We we see this as overdone with several catalysts ahead. Lower rates. You&#39;re like, how are we going to get lower rates? We just had a credit downgrade last night. Who saw that? Okay. Uh people were asking me what&#39;s going to happen Monday morning. I was like, I don&#39;t know. All I know is the businesses in my portfolio, their free cash flow is going to be the same. Their revenues is are going to be the same. Their earnings power is going to be the same. Uh so I don&#39;t I don&#39;t spend a lot of time on that. Uh and what we&#39;ve seen in the past the last two times kind of like you get a little dip and then it&#39;s fine. So we view this as a long-term opportunity and highlight three picks picks and shovel plays to express the theme. Why aren&#39;t we just buying home builders if we&#39;re so excited about this theme? Uh, we like to buy the arms dealers, not the waring factions. The waring factions beat themselves up. As this thesis plays out, you&#39;re going to see a massive volume of new starter homes produced, which is going to create excess supply, the exact opposite of what we have right now, which is a der of supply. And you&#39;re going to see incentives, you&#39;re going to see margin compression, you&#39;re going to see big volume. And we&#39;re going to talk about how do we get to that position. So at the current pace of construction, it would take seven and a half years to close the multi-million dollar home deficit, which is about four or five million homes. Um decade plus of underbuilding has pushed the median age of owner occupied homes to 41 years from 31 in 20 uh 2005. 48% of the new housing stock dates back to of the US housing stock dates back to the 1980s or earlier. So, we have an old housing stock. We have a limited housing stock and uh we need to build four to seven million homes very very quickly. So, how how&#39;s that going to happen? First off, mortgage rates are easing. Okay, so they peaked at seven and change. They&#39;re now down, you know, six and a half or so, but the uh 7.79, highest in 23 years. Today, they&#39;re at 6.76. And they&#39;ve been rangebound between six and a half and seven for the past six months. Now, um part of that is people are stuck in low mortgages. That&#39;s affecting supply. Uh when rates approach 6% in late 2024, we saw 18 consecutive weeks of positive purchase applications. Okay, so now we&#39;ve come back up. So, how do we get mortgage rates down? Well, Secretary Bashan, our Treasury Secretary, made it clear. Okay, he his objective is to lower the 10-year yield. What are mortgage rates priced off of? It&#39;s not priced off the Fed funds rate. It&#39;s priced off the 10-year yield because it&#39;s a longer duration loan. And how he&#39;s going to do that is he&#39;s going to exempt governmentbacked securities from the SLR. And he believes that will lower the 10-year yield by 30 to 70 basis points. And we expect this to happen in the second half of the year. So, if you take the 10-year yield down 30 to 70 basis points, which would basically be 375 to 350, you get a 30-year fixed mortgage. I know this is going to blow your mind, uh, below 6%. And if you get a 30-year fixed mortgage at five and change in the next 12 months, the demand for housing is going to be something like we have never seen in our lifetimes because everyone has been priced out. Everyone&#39;s been waiting. And then you couple that with you&#39;re going to start to see an increase of supply. 1982 40% of the new homes were entry level under,400 square foot house. Uh by 2023 that dropped to 9%. And how are they going to get more supply? Those colored areas on the map are federal lands that there&#39;s currently no construction on. Trump is going to open up a portion of those lands to construct starter homes. So you get your 1500 foot house from KB Homes with your 5.9% mortgage and an endangered elk in your backyard free of charge. Okay. It&#39;s going to be awesome. Um, so he&#39;s also cut red tape. That&#39;s a top priority under this administration. He&#39;s terminated the AFFH rule. He&#39;s restored local control and removed local zoning tax. In 2022, 83% of uh delays were attributed to permitting issues. They are going to destroy the red tape and make it easier and easier for companies to build, to buy land, and to build quickly. The administration is focused on another key solution. Opening portions of the 640 million acres of federal land for large-scale housing development. Roughly 47 million acres where 7.3% of federal land fall within metropolitan areas. Everyone thinks it&#39;s only in the middle of nowhere. Uh where more housing is needing needed. And the AEI estimates that if we just unlock, forget 640 million acres, if we just unlock 512,000 acres in the metro areas and outside areas, that could support the construction of 3 million new homes. Okay. Now, if you&#39;re going to build three million new homes, uh demographics, you know about the millennials, they all need houses. They&#39;re all starting families. We won&#39;t go into that.\n### FEATURED_COMPANY_DEEP_DIVES\nHere&#39;s pick number one, QXO. This is a Brad Jacobs company. Does anyone know who Brad Jacobs is? Okay. He one guy, the guy who listens to my podcast, uh too, uh he wrote a book, How to make a few billion dollars. He&#39;s made about12 billion and he&#39;s made a lot more for shareholders. He&#39;s starting this QXO. He&#39;s going to roll up building supply companies because he sees this opportunity. Uh we built a position at $13 and change. It&#39;s like 16 now. Over the next five to seven years, we believe this stock goes well above 50, probably 80 to $100. Uh he did XPO logistics and he did United Rentals. Did everyone know United Rentals and Equipment Leasing? Both of those were rollups. If you put a million bucks in United Rentals, you made over 50 million bucks over 20 years. If you put a million in XPO over 10 years, you made about 60 million. Okay, that&#39;s enough to get that coffee going, that caffeine going. Ladies and gentlemen, he&#39;s going to do it again. And by the way, he put 150 million when he did of his own money in XPO. He&#39;s put a billion dollars of his own money in QXO. So, he&#39;s putting his money where his mouth is. He sees this trend. He aims to do 10% of any given industry. It&#39;s an $800 billion industry. 80 billion topline, 10% IBIDA margins. That&#39;s eight billion dollars. You put a 12 10 12 times multiple, you have, you know, conservatively five six bagger, but we think it could be closer to, you know, $100 stock. I think uh that&#39;s that&#39;s how we&#39;re underwriting it. Right now, Beacon is their platform company. It&#39;s a roofing company they just bought. So, they&#39;re in business. Now, they&#39;ll roll up all different types of um arms dealers to the home builders, all types of building supply companies over the next five years. This is one you buy, you tuck away. Not for five minutes, not for five months, five years. Huge multiple on your money. We like it. Second one is Stanley Black &amp; Decker. If you&#39;re going to build houses, what do you need? Tools. They own DeWalt. They own Craftsman. They own Stanley. This one got crushed by COVID over inventoried, inflation, etc. What I can tell you is they&#39;ve taken out the last two years almost $2 billion of business uh of cost.$2 two billion dollars of costs, which equates to about uh it&#39;s about $13 per share on $154 million shares just on the cost savings as they normalize margins. Uh we think that&#39;s worth $200. It&#39;s trading at $71 right now. It&#39;s not going to do it in three months. It&#39;s going to do it in three years as the cycle turns. The operating leverage in this business is insane. When construction volumes go up and and construction turns the corner, this is the business to play because this business has been around since 1843. It&#39;s been through a couple cycles, ladies and gentlemen. 1843. You think it&#39;s going to make it through, you know, made it through the Great Depression, made it through the Great Financial Crisis. You think it&#39;s going to make it through Trump? of course he&#39;s going to make it through Trump because he&#39;s going to make everyone build houses and bring the houses down and and uh bring the cost down, etc. So, we love this play. Uh we think management has done a good job executing in really hard conditions. We love that they they&#39;ve delevered the balance sheet, taken the costs out. So, and we&#39;re seeing now the business inflect revenues start to reacelerate. Margins starting to reacelerate. The last time they got margins to this level, the stock traded at $150 a share. Okay. And the final one is GenerRack, the Kleenex of home standby generators. Okay. No, we&#39;re not going to cure cancer today. We&#39;re not going to guess who&#39;s going to win the AI race, but we&#39;re going to keep your power on so you can run your AI queries through uh Alibaba&#39;s Quinn 2.4 large language model. Uh you can use open AI, too. But uh we&#39;re going to talk about uh a special international play in the breakout room. Uh what is that in 15 minutes, Mike? Yeah, you&#39;re okay. So, you&#39;re gonna like that. The theme of that room is called How the Uninvestable Became Investable. We&#39;re going to talk about some quote unquote currently uninvestable stocks and the actions we took in previous uninvestable stocks and what happened. Okay. Uh so GenerRack is a huge play on the home building. All I can tell you about this one and this is really what I do. I like to look at divergences between price and cash flow because the only reason you give $1 of your money into any business is you expect to get more than $1 back. So if they&#39;re not generating any cash, then your only hope is that another sucker comes behind you and pays more. And that&#39;s nothing more than a hope. And where you can really get hurt is if that hope comes true because as I said at the beginning of the presentation is the gamblers tend to give the money back to the casino. So when you get the high flyers right and you double your money quickly and you don&#39;t know how it happened oftentimes you wind up saying I&#39;m so smart and going into the next thing that you don&#39;t understand and uh and getting hurt. So with this you can see what&#39;s happened. You can see why the price dropped 80%. You see those red bars on the top? That&#39;s negative free cash flow. People were worried about solveny risk. Look what&#39;s happened since they&#39;ve cut cost, increased margin, and the cycles come back. Free cash flow&#39;s gone up. And what hasn&#39;t gone up yet that&#39;s starting to inflect is price. And if you can find businesses where there&#39;s a divergence between either a price has gone up too high and cash flow is negative, that could be a short or price hasn&#39;t gone back up but cash flow has recovered. When they turn, it turns all at once and you make many multiples very very quickly. Uh this is going to be a triple over the next few years. This is another leverage play on the housing recovery inherent demand. So, uh, three super boring plays with super exciting outcomes if you have the patience and you sit tight and watch this play out over the next few years. So,\n\nng up Amazon during its worst year since 20 2000 and Google after both were cut in half that year. This was Google and Amazon cut in half. now um and investors puked in the hole and you couldn&#39;t give away a tech stock because what free money all the VC money crowded in in 2021 uh chasing ridiculous ideas and ridiculous deals that weren&#39;t making money as you got forced liquidations and the business plans didn&#39;t play out. These were a source of funds for many private investors. Those were a double in about a year and a half. Both stocks are essentially flat since we exited. Okay. Now, the most uninvestable opportunity ever is China. And uh this is one of the category that takes longer than expected. This has not been a vornnado. Okay? This has been a multi-year thing. We started in the hundreds uh and we bought all the way down to the 60s. And that was a scary day. I remember because because they had $80 billion of cash and I think it was like what $18 billion of debt at the time something like that so they had the runway they still had the growth they still had the free cash flow what they didn&#39;t have was investor flows foreign investor flows they didn&#39;t have uh excitement they didn&#39;t have FOMO but that&#39;s when we like to to buy stocks okay uh you can see all the\n### HEADLINES_AND_NEWS\nheadlines  there were 35 35 consecutive 135 weeks of negative\n\n### HEADLINES_AND_NEWS\nheadlines  there were 35 35 consecutive 135 weeks of negative headlines  about China and Alibaba. 135 weeks from one single journalist. Okay. Now, I won&#39;t say anything about this journalist, but I will say it would be the equivalent uh where this where this journalist was from would be the equivalent of having a Palestinian write articles about Israeli breakthrough tech companies. Okay, you&#39;re not going to get a positive article out of this one. And it was just going on and on and on. So, these were uninvestable for nearly four years, three years. And she wasn&#39;t the only one. uh every journalist and every sell side and everyone investor was negative on China. So let&#39;s take a look at perception versus reality. Okay, you know the story about the the the peak is when they canled the ant group IPO. Okay. And Xihinping, not Xihinping. Jackma Ma went into hiding became enemy number one because he spoke poorly about Xihinping. And we had the threats of dlisting the stock in the US. They had to go through the PCAOB report. They passed that with flying colors only to get new\n\n### HEADLINES_AND_NEWS\nheadlines about China and Alibaba. 135 weeks from one single journalist. Okay. Now, I won&#39;t say anything about this journalist, but I will say it would be the equivalent uh where this where this journalist was from would be the equivalent of having a Palestinian write articles about Israeli breakthrough tech companies. Okay, you&#39;re not going to get a positive article out of this one. And it was just going on and on and on. So, these were uninvestable for nearly four years, three years. And she wasn&#39;t the only one. uh every journalist and every sell side and everyone investor was negative on China. So let&#39;s take a look at perception versus reality. Okay, you know the story about the the the peak is when they canled the ant group IPO. Okay. And Xihinping, not Xihinping. Jackma Ma went into hiding became enemy number one because he spoke poorly about Xihinping. And we had the threats of dlisting the stock in the US. They had to go through the PCAOB report. They passed that with flying colors only to get new headlines\n\n### HEADLINES_AND_NEWS\n\n### HEADLINES_AND_NEWS\nduring China negotiations this year about delisting because Rick Scott has a problem with Chinese companies uh because the new SEC chair uh was very tight on votes and Rick Scott said you want my vote you got to look into this. So we switched all our shares from US listings to Hong Kong. I think now that the Chinese negotiations are going well, I think that was a leverage point that they were playing because if they actually delisted US ads, all they heard is US investors. They would torpedo $800 billion of US investors cash, the Chinese don&#39;t get hurt. They don&#39;t own it in they don&#39;t own US ADRs. So, uh, I think it was on purpose with the intent to kind of threaten the Chinese government that if you don&#39;t come to the table, you&#39;re going to lose access to the US capital markets. That that&#39;s my take. That said, I made the move anyway to protect my investors capital. That&#39;s my number one responsibility. We still own derivatives in the US because that&#39;s a risk we&#39;re willing to assume in that 10% bucket. any position we put on um for excess returns uh will accept that risk because the underlying stock position will more than make up for that many full times but we want to keep that expression because we can&#39;t replicate it in Hong Kong. We can replicate the stock position in Hong Kong. So for simplicity sake all this is probably noise. The the odds of them delisting are very low in my opinion but it&#39;s not nothing. So if you want a a more as riskless as you can get while still assuming any risk with investing you can through interactive brokers you can just buy the ticker 9988 instead of buying BABA. Okay. So china&#39;s rapid economic expansion has been driven by increased manufacturing and production while we&#39;re relying on an investment growth model. consumption makes up 55% of GDP in China compared to 70% in wealthier nations. US households consume 12 times the nominal dollar amount of their Chinese counterparts. China&#39;s made boosting domestic consumption a top economic priority in the last 12 months, aiming for 70% by 2035. To put it in perspective, China&#39;s 2024 GDP was $18 trillion with consumption at 55%, which is 10.3 trillion if they grow 5% this year and then slow to 3% annually through 2025, hitting the 70% consumption target would mean 18.5 trillion in annual consumption by 2035. That&#39;s an 8.23 trillion jump. Alibaba has 40% of the Chinese e-commerce market. So this is what we call ladies and gentlemen a toll taker. Okay. The government is now mandated that consumption is their number one priority and Alibaba is going to get a piece of that action that the government&#39;s going to push. Okay. And when the Chinese government makes something their priority, you remember solar panels, you remember EVs, okay, there&#39;s 60% of global EV markets and now it&#39;s consumption. They want to get that 20 trillion of savings circulating in their market so they&#39;re less dependent on exports. On the flip side, the US, you can see it makes perfect sense that we would do a rebalance because we have such a we want to increase our manufacturing. This is the red line. Okay, this is consumption. This is manufacturing in the US. This is consumption in China versus manufacturing. They just want to kind of normalize. Bring this down a little bit. Bring this up a little bit. Bring this up a little bit. Maybe keep this up. Maybe it goes back a little bit. And that&#39;s a natural healthy thing and that&#39;s the purpose of the trade talks. So, uh, politicians will always do the right thing after exhausting all other options and that&#39;s exactly what Xiinping did. uh he ca he did a policy 180 after youth unemployment topped 20 it was actually 25% some say 40% but more than that is when unrest hit the streets and when we saw the data on the number of protests we knew we were at an inflection because either he changed or they would change him and um and he changed and he pivoted and it was done overnight he&#39;s been stimulating ever since the numbers are slowly improveving improving in pits and starts and for Baba they&#39;re improving materially. Even this most recent earnings report I wrote some notes that I left on the other stage but uh you know Taobal and T- mall which is their retail up 12% yearon year. That&#39;s hard when you&#39;re number one in the market to get that level of growth 12%. cloud business number one compute power they&#39;ve got 40% of the cloud market Jeff 36% okay so they&#39;re the number one cloud provider compute uh Beijing&#39;s pivoted from tech crackdowns to open support Jackm&#39;s public return and front row handshake sent a clear message the private sector is back in favor and seen as a key partner in economic in China&#39;s economic future that was not the case when we bought the stock Okay, that&#39;s why we have a blended basis of $82 versus 125 or 130 wherever it is now and going over 200. Plus, Ji Singh uh Xi sees private tech as a key to his 2030 goals to lead in semiconductors, energy, AI. China needs more entrepreneurs on board, calling this the right time for private enterprises to fully display their talents. you know, after 2030, he may go back to being uh unfriendly, but right now he knows in order to stay in power and deliver, he needs to do this. So, China&#39;s stimulus plan targets the 20 trillion in household savings. People have been saving money because they&#39;ve been scared because the policies policies are changing. The consumer is thawing and that money is going to wind up. action plan for boosting consumption includes a 4% budget deficit, moderately loose monetary policy, u reserve ratio requirement cuts, lower rates, trade-in programs, and statebacked stock buying. They&#39;re actually like the Japanese in the market buying stocks to prop up the market right now. And if you want to move the market, what&#39;s the number one stock you want to buy? The heaviest waiting in all the indices, okay? Your Alibabas of the world and your 10 cents of the world. If you move those stocks, you move your market. If you move your market, more FOMO comes in from outside investors. And that&#39;s explicitly what they&#39;re doing. They&#39;re not even hiding it under the table. We are buying stocks. So, do you want to get in front of that freight train or ignore that freight train? Uh, the Japanese did it. You saw what happened to their markets two years ago. Okay. So, you see that they&#39;re running the highest deficit. They&#39;re running their deficit at the highest level in decades. This is deficit spending to spur growth. M2 money supply globally. If you look at the pull up the chart, go to Google when you go home, you&#39;re going to see that it troughed and it&#39;s going straight up again. And all of that increase in money supply, all that stimulative stuff, it&#39;s not coming from the US. We&#39;re cutting spending. It&#39;s coming from China. M2 money supply, that equals liquidity. That means asset prices go up. And it&#39;s all centered in China. So, if you don&#39;t have I understand being nervous about China, but if you don&#39;t have like some exposure, even if you buy an ETF, my uh friend Brendan Ahern runs KB, which is a China ETF. Uh I think 86% of his holdings are held in China. He still has like 14% in the US that he can&#39;t get in China. Uh but for me, this is the best asymmetric reward. And if I&#39;m going to risk a dollar of capital, I need a double plus. And this is this is where you get it. If you own a basket, it&#39;s very hard to get those type of returns. Uh return of foreign capital, foreign inflows remain at historic lows. Very similar to energy in 2020, the waitings of China equities and all the international funds, the flows into the sector. It&#39;s exact. I I I don&#39;t know if this is worse or energy was worse in 2020 because in 2020, the narrative was so clear like windmills and solar panels and like if you use oil, you&#39;re going to hell. I mean that was basically uh permeated everything. I think with China people are just a little nervous until they see some price go up is basically all the analysts. There&#39;s one major sellside bank which I won&#39;t name. They were aggressively aggressively downgrading Alibaba at $60 and they&#39;re now aggressively upgrading it at $125 and change. The consensus price target has gone from like 80 to $175 now. And now there was another firm out on Friday at $190. And when it goes over 200, they&#39;ll all move it up to 250. And that&#39;s that&#39;s how it works. They blow with the wind. Opinion follows trend. Okay. Uh foreign investor exposure to the second world&#39;s second largest economy sits near record lows at 5% down from 14%. Remember where I was talking about the waiting of energy in 2020? It went from 10% down to 3%. That&#39;s usually the low. Okay. When when the weights drop by 66% uh whether it&#39;s a sector within the index or in this case China within the international index, you can see here the extremity of where we are right now. It&#39;s very much like uh you&#39;d have to go back to 2021 to see that. Or you could look at this was a monster rally in Chinese stocks when it bottomed out here like it seems to be bottoming out right now. Yeah. Go ahead. pretty much every red day for two years I bought stock. Oh, we have size limits. So, we&#39;ll never go above like our our biggest position ever. We did that two times. Um we did it with Wells Fargo during the pandemic. We went up to 20%. And that was a quick double and we we did it with Baba and now Cooper Standard because it&#39;s gone up 5x has become a huge part of the portfolios. Huge huge. So we have to we have to constantly assess the current weight as these things go up in price. I mean you know Baba has now moved up from 82 basis to 125 and going. So it&#39;s making up bigger and bigger weights over time. So we have to constantly monitor it. But the answer to your question is I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve ever bought a stock on a green day. Yeah. Yeah. Stopped out in terms of what the risk I&#39;m willing to take. Um All right. So this shows revenues cash flow and these are type of things I like to look at. This is just a page from value line and you can see over time what&#39;s happening to the revenues per share, what&#39;s happening to the cash flow per share, what&#39;s happening to the earnings per share. And what&#39;s interesting is if you actually look at that for good businesses that line tends to be like in a bad period it&#39;ll be flat. In a in normal periods, it goes like this and then stock price goes like this around the actual fundamentals of the business. And what we try to do is we try to buy when price is here, but fundamentals are still here. And we try to sell when price is here and everyone&#39;s excited and there&#39;s\n\n\nUS data centers are currently powered mainly by gas and coal. We love the gas play with comtock.

The analogy they're drawing is that this is sharp like the COVID. Record shorting by other. So you're still got a lot of people caught in the hole. Like during COVID, which which forces them as buyers on every positive headline and according to Bessant, there's going to be many deals announced. Very hard to get bearish into that. Prime Book, US single stocks, positive value equals a ton of record short covering here, ladies and gentlemen. Just like you saw at the end of 2022, early 2023, time to be a buyer, not a seller. The shorts are the first buyers. Then the natural buyers come in, then the forced buyers come in. S&P 500 sectors announced buybacks. We talked about record announcements, 665 billion last week, year to date. Infoch, financials, communication services, consumer discretionary. You can't give away consumer discretionary. They're announcing a lot of buybacks and doing a lot of buybacks. More clues that the lows are in for 2025. We covered this on a different chart. Ryan Dietrich also put it out. Performance after 55% of components make a 20-day high 1970 to current shows very positive returns. Option sentiment remains bearish on the dollar. As I said, now that everyone's getting bearish, we probably get a counter trend bounce before we resume the secular trend lower. US earnings revision momentum turns positive. Gage showed renewed optim optimism after 6 months of negative readings. Okay, so that's a positive thing to start to see. Midcap forward earnings relative to small cap going up. Bulls are built on the shoulders of bears. You can see these big bull markets and the kind of short-term draw down. So which we just had a bare market draw a 20% draw down and now we are in bull market as the markets recovered. NASDAQ over 20% and the other indices following suit some of the European indices at all-time highs. World percentage of equity indices above 50-day moving average. This is what you see coming out of a trough in fall of 2023. That's a good thing. That first abrupt move upward. non- US markets while cheap relative to the US are not particularly inexpensive relative to their own history. China again being the lowest emerging markets, United Kingdom, that's where there's some serious opportunity there. Another rare and bullish signal. S&P performance after 60% of components make a 20-day new high. 12 months out, up 9% on average, 10.4% medium. When Degraph and Zwag breath thrusts occur. When Degraph and Zwag breath thrusts occur within one month of each other. Six Six months later, you're up 16% on average. One year later, up 26%. So, a lot of positive things to be looking forward to. Money market mutual funds held by retail and institutions. Lot of dry powder here. Record dry powder impacted Buffett's gifts. Buffett's fortune would have topped Musk's if he hadn't donated shares to charity. He'd be $87 billion wealthier than Elon Musk if he hadn't given away so much. He'd be worth $400 billion. This is the goat, ladies and gentlemen. Never doubt it. Never think it will be replicated. Buffett was and is the greatest of all time. Hedge funds still look to short stocks which it is further buying power for upside on every positive headline. Won't be straight up will be fits and starts. Upside is the direction. Like I said months ago, welcome to Trump 2.0. Same as Trump 1.0. New volatility, new tweet, new volatility resolves to the upside over time. The share of those who carry credit card balances is below 2019 levels for all income groups. The c customer balance sheet is still good. Flows into Europe are picking up. Opinion follows trend. Loan growth in China expected to soon pick up. As a matter of fact, global M2 money supply, pull it up on Google, is reacelerating. And a lot of that is attributable to China's massive stimulus that's in the pipeline and happening as we speak. And we're seeing it in the numbers. This is S&P 500. Healthcare relative performance is off the charts low. There's opportunities to be had there. We expressed through biotech basket and Baxter for now, but we continue to look for opportunity. Teima. So, you can see a lot of the um a lot of the obesity stocks got hit. You remember when Lily was so hot and I said, \"Ladies and gentlemen, there there's there's competitions coming.\" Just like I said with Nvidia, competition's coming. Um when they get that extreme and that certain Nova Nordis and everything else, they've just been slaughtered. Post election years tend to bottom in early April and rally. So here we are in the seasonality that bodess well all the way into late summer. So let's keep the heat on and stay focused. Then value benefit is so you can see where we are relative to where we should be and it looks like some more strength maybe a little weakness in mid July. Value benefit from broading broadening Q1 broadening has averaged 42% since February 19th. So that's a sign of stocks beating the S&P. That's broadening. That's healthy. That's good for stock pickers like us. United States retail sales year-over-year they soft data they keep saying that the world is ending the hard data they keep spending like there's no tomorrow. United Healthcare Group biggest draw down since 2009. A lot of people keep asking. I think there's no way to have certainty that there wasn't some level of fraud. The question is how much. I think we're close to the levels where you got you could take a coin flip gamble. We're not going to do that. But if it gets to 200 or below and stays there for a little while, we might be interested. I think enough people and institutions got slaughtered in this that it's going to take a while to rebuild a base. So, we're in no rush and we want more information and we're willing to miss it. Healthc care sector relative to S&P 500, the cheapest since 2001. There's opportunity. There's a pony in this pile as they say. High yield credit spreads coming in. Sign of no recession. There was fear in April 7th. That fear has subsided. Overall, Prime Book gross versus net leverage still a lot of room to run for risk on and chasing electricity consumption going through the roof. Comtock resources, how you doing? Alibaba cloud year-on-year revenue growth up 18% year-on-year. Look at the acceleration not just in the absolute revenue but in the pace at which the revenue is growing fueled by uh being number one in cloud services fueled by AI products and just be beginning. Mike Zucardi Bank of America over 70% of survey respondents plan on vacationing this summer. A higher percentage than last year's survey. Good thing to do if you believe the world is coming to an end. uh but uh your actions do not reflect it and we focus on actions not words. Four-year cycle for 2025 we're following right along TAC which again points to strength all the way into uh early August with a little bit of bumpiness in June. This has been our framework since the beginning of the year. We didn't expect the magnitude of the draw down. We were looking for buckle up buttercup February March 8 to 10% pullback. We got Liberation Day and we used it to our advantage. You got to play the cards you're dealt, not the cards you want and we played that uh like like an absolute World Series of Poker Champion in April and uh we're excited and uh you played right along with us and uh that's that's just absolutely amazing. Breath of Earnings suggests Bed should be in a cutting phase. We agree too late. Powell is a real thing. He's 150 basis points too restrictive percent of S&P 500 members above the 50-day moving average now at 75% abrupt short covering. Now we get into the chase phase. Magnificent 7 mirroring Nifty50 performance. Uh I don't love these analogs but it's worth noting pockets of it for sure. XLV after 52- week low and positive close a year out. That's the health care sector up on average 21%. Got to be focused on health care right now. Concentration of S&P 500 market cap and earnings in the 10 largest index constituents. The market cap uh is 37% share of the S&P 500 while the earnings are only 30%. These numbers have a tendency to converge. Which is why we said uh before the draw down of mag 7 that mag 7 was going to correct. That was go back to all of our podcasts in uh the last quarter of last year. They certainly did and everyone said it was tariffs but most of them are unaffected by tariffs. So what actually wasn't? it was the fact that their earnings growth decelerated from 33% to 15% ballpark and um and their multiple still hasn't come down commensurate with that reduction in earnings power. Therefore, we do think that while they will bounce and maybe trade as a group back to the top of the range, the real opportunity is going to be in the 493 uh and these will continue to underperform relative to the indices. That doesn't mean crash. That doesn't mean tech wreck of 2000 or 2022. It means underperform relative to the unmagnificent 493 as a basket. Gap between mag 7 and 493 earnings growth is expected to narrow. 36% earnings growth last year, 15% this year. Unmnificent 4% last year, moving up to 13%. The euro's had its best year-to- date gain since 2020. Dollar weakening, euro gaining. People are starting to get excited, which means um we'll have a short-term pause. Retail market share reached 36% in late April on low market volume. Tariff estimates keep sliding. Went all the way up to 28% now down to 14%. Probably nets out around 10% give or take. Plus the non-tariff barriers is going to be the whole name of the game particularly as it relates to China opening their market. biggest six weeks VIX percent declines and forward S&P total returns. So on average uh you're looking at five years out 92% return average one year out 20.8 uh and uh we are in that neighborhood. What did we have here? Uh goodness. Wow. The biggest VIX crush. So if you look at some of these others, they were up 46% a year out. But anyway, the point is the mean a year out is 20%. When you get the VIX collapse off such high levels, S&P 500 one-year forward returns after the last 58% of the S&P 500 stocks hit a four new four-week high. You can see on average 16.1%. Lot of positivity, almost 100% positivity ratio, if not 100% exactly. smaller share of homes built in 2010s than any decade since 1940s. You know what happened next? The game was on. We're going to talk, we talked about in that presentation uh at the money show the reasons why that's going to be taking place. US versus foreign stock fund performance. Foreign large blend is up 12.6% year-to date. US large blend is up 6 12% outperformance of international versus US. That's going to continue. The last time you had that divergence, you had seven years of international outperformance. Prime Book US Energy uh weekly net flows that people are starting to uh nibble around energy stocks. Magnificent 7 PE premium versus the 493 has come back to uh 43% premium, but the earnings growth again still probably doesn't justify it. That's why I think it trades back up to the highs, but it probably as a basket uh stalls out. What if you panic sold and missed April 9th? Uh you're still down 9% versus flat. Or if you listen to this podcast, you're up a ton. Okay, that's the bottom line. Uh, and if you were on that client call that we did, you're up a lot more than a ton. Housing inventory active listing count in Florida. So, Florida tends to be a leading indicator and you're seeing a lot of supply in Florida and you're seeing price declines in a lot of pockets of Florida. So, we're keeping a close eye on that. That should could help. Affordability. Consumers don't believe break evens or CPI. University of Michigan. A lot of these data have been coming in by political party. The Republicans think there's no inflation, the Democrats think it's 6%. So, the truth is actually probably right in the middle like everything else. Hong Kong equities surged for a fourth consecutive month in April, reaching 166 billion Hong Kong dollars, well above historical average. While momentum remains strong, easing US China tensions and yuan stabilization. May temper May inflow signaling a potential pause in the capital shift toward Hong Kong. So, we saw a little bit of that. I think that's goes right back on based on they uh lowered rates again for the first time in 7 months. The Chinese, they're going to keep the pedal to the metal. Sector fund inflows going back into technology in the short term. Financials again, I think top of the range is where that targets. Equity positioning across sectors. Utilities is overweight. Materials is underweight. We like Albamaro there. Demographics are a tailwind to housing demand. We can't overemphasize that. Go to hedge fundtips.com get the slide deck. When you go to the article of the week, which is Baba back in business, you will see the slide deck there. No, this is not another rally. S&P performance after 19% in 27 trading days has average another 9.2% up in the next 12 months. Atlanta GDP now is for the this quarter. Q2 is 2.3 or 2.5% give or take which means no recession. We got negative GDP although it was inventory affected pull forward uh in Q1. You still don't want two consecutive quarters of negative GDP growth. Look at all the Dubai buildings in the background. Pretty cool. And then NASDAQ compositive change in the three years after Netscape release versus CH GPT release. So you had a shakeout. This implies that we got more to go. They're doing an analog bespoke Paul Hickeyy's uh kind of trying to show that there's a lot more upside. We agree NASDAQ composite change in the 5 years after Netscape released versus chat GPT release. These analoges are worth noting but not worth betting the ranch on. But I do think there's a lot of runway. Roaring 2000s is nent. We're halfway through. US households buy highest price home they can afford. um house price. Yeah, and that's the problem. The median house is in the 400s and most people can't afford it. Funding spreads, professional investor positioning, average funding spread, S&P level. So, [Music] um this will chase up GS social media economic sentiment index university. So, Goldman Sachs sentiment is high. The University of Michigan is very low. These are divergences. This is start looking a lot like hard data versus soft data. We think that the soft data will catch up to the hard data as opinion follows trend. Net retail net imbalance before 12:30 p.m. Very high. I'm not sure what the use of that chart is. The median age of all home buyers is now 56 years old, up from 31 in 1981. How are they going to solve for this? Get the deck.

All I can tell you about this one and this is really what I do. I like to look at divergences between price and cash flow because the only reason you give $1 of your money into any business is you expect to get more than $1 back. So if they&#39;re not generating any cash, then your only hope is that another sucker comes behind you and pays more. And that&#39;s nothing more than a hope. And where you can really get hurt is if that hope comes true because as I said at the beginning of the presentation is the gamblers tend to give the money back to the casino. So when you get the high flyers right and you double your money quickly and you don&#39;t know how it happened oftentimes you wind up saying I&#39;m so smart and going into the next thing that you don&#39;t understand and uh and getting hurt. So with this you can see what&#39;s happened. You can see why the price dropped 80%. You see those red bars on the top? That&#39;s negative free cash flow. People were worried about solveny risk. Look what&#39;s happened since they&#39;ve cut cost, increased margin, and the cycles come back. Free cash flow&#39;s gone up. And what hasn&#39;t gone up yet that&#39;s starting to inflect is price. And if you can find businesses where there&#39;s a divergence between either a price has gone up too high and cash flow is negative, that could be a short or price hasn&#39;t gone back up but cash flow has recovered. When they turn, it turns all at once and you make many multiples very very quickly. Uh this is going to be a triple over the next few years. This is another leverage play on the housing recovery inherent demand. So, uh, three super boring plays with super exciting outcomes if you have the patience and you sit tight and watch this play out over the next few years. So,\n### ASK_ME_ANYTHING_QA\nwith that said , I think we&#39;ve got it all. That&#39;s how you can reach me and we&#39;ll take one question or two. Yeah. Building. Yeah, I love it. Owen&#39;s in the house. Yeah, exactly. I think it would be great. Uh I haven&#39;t looked at the underlying fundamentals and and price and all that stuff, but I think anything in that sector, I like the way you&#39;re thinking. Absolutely. Yeah. And by the way, and and the other thing I would think about these type of stocks, when you have a stock like Gener that&#39;s down 75%. Okay. Um, if it goes $5 against you tomorrow, just log in, look at the free cash flow and say, &quot;Ah, in the short term, the market is a voting machine based on emotion. That&#39;s where you get $5 moves.&quot; And you say, &quot;Am I wrong? What does everyone else know?&quot; Nothing. It could be a hedge fund blowing up. It could be a short attack. It could be nothing. Just look at the underlying business. Like if you were going to buy a jersey Mike&#39;s down the street and the guy said, &quot;How much do you want for your business?&quot; you say, &quot;Well, why don&#39;t you show me your books first, and if you&#39;re profitable, I&#39;ll make you an offer.&quot; You know, people do that in normal business. They don&#39;t do it in the stock market. And if you just apply that framework, uh, I think you&#39;re going to see massive success in your investing future.

So, uh,\n### ASK_ME_ANYTHING_QA\n\n\nquestions  from the audience. So, I'll get like 10 to 12 different companies per week and I'll pull up the chart. I pull up the balance sheet. I pull up the income statement. I pull up the cash flow statement. And we go through it step by step. And I say, \"That's a great question. Here's why I would definitely look deeper at this because this is a great idea. Here's why I would pass.\" And I do like in the last half hour, I do like 10 12 of those very, very quickly. Um, well, actually, not very quickly. Sometimes it runs for like a long time. Uh, so that would be a great place. Send that in. So you will be the number one\n\n### ASK_ME_ANYTHING_QA\n\n Yeah. I think for Generrack uh it is seasonal and none of their guidance includes any type of uh extreme events and there&#39;s usually always an extreme event at this time of year. So they don&#39;t put it in. So they could they what we call sandbag. They very conservative on the guidance. Um you know we look we started building that thing. We had a basis below 100. It shot up to 194. It&#39;s come down to 124. It&#39;s not changed our view on the stock. It&#39;s just how it recovers. Thing had a heart attack. You know when you have a heart attack you get off the table. You don&#39;t run a marathon. You go out. You walk around with the pole. You let go of the pole. You think you&#39;re okay. You fall on the floor. or they&#39;re like go back to the poll for a little while. I mean 80% down is a heart attack. Okay. So now they&#39;re walking again with the pole and they&#39;re going to try again and then they&#39;re going to do better. And this happens. It is a very cyclical business because uh in in some of our video cast we&#39;ve gone through the cycles where they have the revenue declines and the cash flow declines and then it starts to reacelerate. But if you look at that slide I did in the last presentation cash flow is nearing record highs and the price the stock price is still down some 80%. This is a uh this is like, you know, Buffett talks about the fat pitch. Wait for the fat pitch. For me, this is a complete no-brainer. Yeah. So, they&#39;ve bought back uh we had we skipped through the slide, but they&#39;ve got 20 billion more on their buyback. They they&#39;ve been buying in tons and tons of stocks for the last few years. They started paying a dividend. They just announced a special dividend. Uh so, we&#39;re not in it for the dividend. It&#39;s nice to see them returning capital. They&#39;re going to continue. They the interesting thing difference between US managers and Chinese managers. The Chinese to their credit were buying every share they could get their hands on below 100 in the hole. Whereas US managers after the stocks up 10x they start b announcing big back by big buybacks so that there&#39;s liquidity for them to sell their own options. And it&#39;s a completely different mindset. So the Chinese buy low and sell high. the uh American managers for the most part when the stock collapses they&#39;re not in the market buying. So we&#39;re happy that they&#39;re doing it and uh their buyback rate is slowing in the 120s which I&#39;m very happy to see. I love that they were buying handover fist in the in the 80s and 70s and they they still have uh 20 billion of authorization and they will use that but um the time to buy for the for the company because they&#39;re stewards of my capital as an owner um was to be buying when when we were buying and uh and and you know I I don&#39;t think we&#39;re going to get material dips from here for them to buy in a huge part of the company. I think from here it&#39;s just going to be it&#39;s just going to keep pushing higher is my general view at this point. Like the pain is in the rear the majority of the pain is in the rearview mirror. I know because I lived it buying on every red day. Um, and now it&#39;s like it&#39;s like that Microsoft chart where it&#39;s just like fundamentals are getting better, but all of a sudden people start to get interested in the stock and all that pen. It&#39;s like holding a beach ball underwater like Gener. How is the cash flow getting so much better and the revenue is starting to improve and the margin starting to expand and the price is still the same as when they had negative cash flow. It&#39;s just you&#39;re holding the beach ball under water and once you let go, it just goes when it comes it comes all at once. That&#39;s the way these turnarounds work. Yes, I met Kathy. Kathy has a house next to our in the town over from our houses in Connecticut. Um, I met her in Tampa. She&#39;s a super sweet woman, like really approachable, nice person. Uh, it&#39;s a different game. I mean, that&#39;s not my lane. So I for me to comment, you know, she&#39;s trying to guess what technologies are going to change the world and she might be right and she might pick one and that&#39;s a thousand bagger and then it will go up. I can&#39;t predict her ability to predict. I can&#39;t even predict. That&#39;s why I don&#39;t predict. I I buy these boring businesses. I can sleep well at night that are quick doubles and triples. So uh I&#39;m the wrong person to ask. But um I hope so. I hope she does great. But uh it&#39;s not not for Ray. Not not what I do. Not not for me. Yeah. What are your thoughts on car manufacturers? General Motors and others are trading wealth. Yeah, great question. I like to buy the arms dealers, not the waring faction. So GM and Ford are going to be a race to the bottom in margins. They&#39;re going to start incentives are going to start going up. Volumes are going to start going up. Race to the bottom. You want to uh play in the companies that benefit from increased volumes and let them deal with the margin compression. Same with the home builders in my opinion. So, uh, that&#39;s how we play it. I think your thinking framework is correct. I just think there are better ways to play that theme. Yeah. All right. Cool. Yeah. Yeah. Um, of those, if you put a gun to my head, I&#39;d own 10 cent for sure. And, uh, if you said you got to own a third, I&#39;d say Muan, but no one has a gun to my head, so I&#39;m just happy owning Alibaba. So, uh, but yeah, I&#39;ve looked at all of them. Yeah. Yes. No, because Brad is one of the few people who can operate a rollup properly. So what he does is he come in comes in into a fragmented business, rolls them up, applies technology. He&#39;s really good at applying technology to get cost synergies. He&#39;s not just like a private equity where he just cuts jobs and hopes that the business keeps running with half the people. um he actually brings value ad operational and synergistic stuff and then scale buying and he&#39;s just done it so many times that he&#39;s one of the few people I would bet on on a rollup because he did it at United Rentals, he did it at Waste Connections, he did it at XBO and he&#39;s just a master of doing this. So um yeah, reasonable concern but wrong guy. Yeah. company. Which guy? Who was Oh, Brad Jacobs has started QXO. It&#39;s a roll up of building supplies to play the housing recovery. Yeah. Cool. All right. Well, thanks for staying a few minutes late. I appreciate it. And uh hope you enjoy. And we&#39;re back. Warren Buffett quote of the week. In the world of business, the people who are the most successful are those who are doing what they love. Uh, no question about it, ladies and gentlemen. I feel like I&#39;m on a treasure hunt every day. Uh, again, Buffett, you don&#39;t need to be a rocket scientist. Investing is not a game where the guy with the 160 IQ beats the guy with the 130 IQ. In fact, it&#39;s often the opposite because the guy with the 160 IQ tends to be more emotional and uh affected by the day-to-day and trying to analyze every\n\n### ASK_ME_ANYTHING_QA\nask me anything . Those of you who don&#39;t like the\n\nask me anything\n\nthat will continue to play out which is why international is going to outperform US and unmagnificent 493 is going to outperform MAG 7 and value is going to go back to outperforming growth as it has for the last 98 years by a magnitude of 4.4% 4% per year. Or in English, if you put a million dollars in value in 1927 or a million dollars in growth, you get 68 million more going into value, even despite the last 15 years and the aberrational zero interest rate policy period, which is not going to persist or reoccur anytime soon. ### ASK_ME_ANYTHING_QA\nWhat are your thoughts on Mona as a possible investment? First off, thanks for your long-term loyalty. Uh he&#39;s talking about um one with that. You got to understand the pipeline, but the problem is is Mr. A is they&#39;re blowing through their cash. So unless a miracle happens with one of their drugs soon, which it very well could. Um, so study the pipeline and get some level of confidence in what&#39;s going to be happening imminently because in the meantime, this is what we call a cash incinerator. Burning cash like it&#39;s going out of style to the tune of this. Is this serious? Four billion a year. Let me see. I mean, you know how hard you have to work to incinerate $4 billion a year? You could work a 100 hours a week and not spend $4 billion a year. Let&#39;s take a look at how they&#39;re doing this feat of burning $4 billion a year and not making any money. First off, the balance sheet, they got 6.87 billion of cash at the end of the year. We probably have no debt. No material debt. What are they doing on the cash flow here though? They are literally blowing $4 billion the last two years. So, uh, the only reason you would get involved in this if is if after you do your research, you&#39;re damn certain they&#39;re going to have some blockbuster drug in the next 12 months. Otherwise, they&#39;re going to be out of cash in two years. So, um, not for me.\nMoving along , Vle Vahasari, love your perspective on Alexandria real estate as a potential turnaround opportunity. Same successful strategy with Vernon. high quality rate, strong track record, top tier assets. Do you see any parallels? I don&#39;t like multif family here. I think all of the excess inventory is going I I if the starter house thesis is correct and the family formation thesis is correct, which I believe it is, I think we&#39;re going to have a glut of multif family. And I think that&#39;s going to be and considering all the people you&#39;re seeing now that are so excited about multif family, it just feels like it&#39;s the wrong time to be getting involved. The right time was a while back, Alexandria, maybe a decade back. The wrong time is when those people are laying off to you and teaching you how to buy B multif family. Not a good formula. Alexandria real estate a Oh, by the way, there was a guy and his family at the money show who wanted me to look at Owen&#39;s Corning. Uh, yeah. All right, Alexandria. Let&#39;s just take a look here. It&#39;s kind of priced in a lot of bad news here. Cash flow continues. Revenues are going up. Cash flow is rolling over. Margins are starting to recover. What&#39;s the dividend? Let me see. I should be able to find it here. Net debt is 12 billion. So, it&#39;s pricing as if they&#39;re not going to be able to refinance some of the debt. Let&#39;s take a look at the financials. balance sheet. [Music] Okay. All right. They got a half a billion dollars of cash and they&#39;ve got $12 billion of debt, but it&#39;s secured by the properties. Cash flow [Music] is pretty decent. is the [Music] uh see if they put the dividend here. I personally don&#39;t want to be in multif family but you know this come in a lot that I&#39;m inclined to say 100% worth doing extra work on it. um you have to be open to the idea that they might have to cut their dividend if they have any problem with financing, but not probably won&#39;t be an issue. And then you really want to know the properties. I mean, in Verernado&#39;s case, I knew all the properties in New York and they were the highest. So, you get a 7% yield, it&#39;s probably okay. Uh you just got to do more work on it. I I think if you love the idea, it&#39;s worth now starting to do the work. Uh, good question.

Okay,### ASK_ME_ANYTHING_QA\nhere is  from uh Albert Rud and his lovely family. I got to meet his daughters. I think one&#39;s at MIT and one is at Rice, so he did a good job from Sarasota. Um, Owens Corning on the basis he listened to my house healthc care present, not healthcare, housing presentation. I don&#39;t know which time zone I&#39;m on, guys. I started in Pacific Standard Time. I went to Eastern. I don&#39;t know what time zone this is. Uh so it&#39;s come in about 25 30%. I think where I came out on this was if I owned it from much lower levels, I would be a hodler, i.e. hold. If I didn&#39;t own it, I would be I would probably want to see a little more weakness, which you might not get. I think you&#39;re generally okay here. Would I put new money to work in this? No. There&#39;s not enough margin of safety for me, but um would I add here if I owned it? No. I think it&#39;s a great business. I think your thinking is correct. I think you own it from much lower levels. In which case, hodddle it. It might go lower before it goes higher, but there&#39;s no reason to really panic out of it anytime soon. And um the housing plays that I mentioned are the ones that I would favor. But uh definitely appreciate the question. Appreciate you coming to all the presentations and introducing your lovely family. Les Edelman interested in your thoughts on WNC. Wabash. Okay. I like the concept. Cash flow the rec the What did this thing do? I mean, the revenues are scary to me. They&#39;ve come down a lot, but they&#39;ve done that before. Seems to be a very cyclical business. The margins, it this is a trade. This is not a business that you want to own. I I I don&#39;t even know what it does yet, and I&#39;m just telling you this is not an own forever. This is a trade. Engineered Solutions for Transportation, Logistics, Infrastructure in the US. Uh, Transportation Solutions Part and Service offers dry van trailers, platform trailers, refrigerated trailers, stainless steel, aluminum tran trailers, dry freight bulk bodies, cargo, flatbed bodies, truck mounting, blah blah blah. It&#39;s probably not a business that should be public. This would be a good private equity target. Um, I think it works as a trade. Decent find. Let&#39;s just take a look at the balance sheet to make sure they&#39;re not going to have financing risk and then we will move on. 115 million in cash, 400 million in debt.

This is pricing like it&#39;s going out of business and that is not a far-fetched idea, but not a guarantee either. So, um it&#39;s a gamble. I don&#39;t take gamles.

There&#39;s a lot more in the metro than you think. We only need 517,000 acres of like 470 million and more of it is in metro areas than you think. Go look at the slides in the article of the week. Next, Chris Williamson. You&#39;re right on Hormell. He&#39;s saying that upside is probably capped at a double. I agree. Uh but that&#39;s fine. It&#39;s good to have a defensive one in there here and there. Thoughts on Murphy Oil? Uh I looked at this one on my own. I think this one&#39;s okay. See? Yeah, it&#39;s that one&#39;s probably okay. Um, Micah Kelsey, thank you for conducting the Cooper Standards CEO interview. Cooper Standards printing cash just like you predicted. Are you looking at adding Estee Lauder at this price? Keep thinking it&#39;s bottomed out. Uh no, but we&#39;re we we&#39;re holding, you know, we don&#39;t uh we&#39;re not adding, we&#39;re not subtracting. We&#39;re just comfortable with the position. We sized it according to the risk, which was serious. It was a play on China, so we already had exposure. They&#39;ve got free cash flow. They&#39;re turning it around. It&#39;s going to take a little while to build a new shareholder base, but no, we didn&#39;t add, we didn&#39;t subtract. We&#39;re just hold hodling and we&#39;re perfectly fine with that. Manic Bouani uh Madak Vajani says quote all the fundamental stories the last guy mentioned end quote. Are you getting a cup with that on it? No. Um but thank you for the comment. Daniel Borman, hey Tom, what are your thoughts on Yeti stock? We&#39;ve covered this one a bunch of times. I continue to look at it. Continue to pass. Can&#39;t think of a reason why I&#39;m passing other than just instinct and no position in the portfolio. But yeah, it&#39;s a high return on invested capital business. There are still some growth left. Cash flow is recovering. There&#39;s nothing to really not love. So the answer is I think you&#39;re right and I want to do more work on it and it may take off without me and and and but it destroyed a lot of people. It&#39;s a broken growth stock. Now the value buyers can come in and it may take another year to build a base or it may take off without us but I think you&#39;re in the neighborhood of what would be something worth looking at. What&#39;s your thoughts on R&amp;B? uh higher it&#39;s going to be part of the trade deal. Victor Hansen, hi. Best finance podcast recommending to everyone. Thank you. Superior industry. [Music] Um I think I like this one. Let me see. Oh, what the hell happened here? Superior Industries. This thing must be going BK because that is trading like it&#39;s death. Let&#39;s see. All right. You&#39;re telling me the debt is not maturing until 2028. They&#39;re free cash flow positive by a hair. Revenues are declining. Margins are starting to bottom out. [Music] Uh, wow. What the hell happened to this business? Let&#39;s see. Let&#39;s see. 480 million. They only have 10 million of cash and 480 million of debt. So, the market&#39;s saying it&#39;s going bankrupt. Uh they might not have to refinance, but can they service the debt is the problem. That&#39;s the problem, ladies and gentlemen. So, you and you know, so they got negative10 million of free cash flow. They got 10 million of cash, 450 million of debt. Trading like a bankruptcy. and it may very well be a bankruptcy. So, uh, this is a gamble. You got to see if they have assets they can sell. How are they going to raise cash? What the turnaround plan is, but you are playing on a nice edge. Go to Moheaggan Sun, bet on black. Griffin Brown, one of Buffett, Munger, and Graham&#39;s great biggest lessons, if not was the power of compounding over decades. Well, they they had a different structure, okay? They had permanent capital. So, what Buffett did before he had a public vehicle was exactly what we did. A lot of turnarounds for doubles and triples. And then when he got a permanent capital structure and public company and unlimited free float coming in from the insurance premiums, he moved up and did buy forever businesses, which don&#39;t go on sale very much, but they compound over time. Different structure, different strategy, same guy. It wasn&#39;t Munger that twisted his arm that he was doing things all wrong. Buffett does what he wants to do. He&#39;s the goat. Munger was just a sideshow. That was a huge contributor. But Munger, Buffett is what made the magic. Uh, and he adjusted based on the capital uh structure that he had less than he did because he didn&#39;t think it wasn&#39;t that he didn&#39;t think what he did when he was managing partnerships wasn&#39;t better. It&#39;s what made sense for the structure. His performance was better doing the turnarounds than it was when he got the law of large numbers and he went for quality. But the quality matched the constant inflow of premiums at zero to negative cost that he could just put to work set and forget versus uh do shorter time. His priorities changed and his structure changed and that&#39;s why he did that. So why we have a three to five year horizon is because we are go we have to perform in a reasonable amount of time uh and we want to have excess returns. So that&#39;s why we do what we do and how we do it. We will find businesses that will want to own for a lifetime. But the ones that double and triple the fact that it got to the point that it can have that type of expected value in a short period of time tells me that&#39;s not a hold forever. Those are the businesses that fall 10 20%. you buy it, you hold it, but you&#39;re not going to dramatically outperform in the short term. And that&#39;s why we uh do that. Is UNH Enron are the buy of a lifetime? The answer is you can&#39;t know. So just because it&#39;s in the",

I&#39;m Tom Hayes and this is your 292nd videocast podcast for the week ending May 20th, 2025 live from Dubai.\n\n### FEATURED_COMPANY_DEEP_DIVES\nfinally  had a nice constructive base and then a breakout above that 200 day moving average, a breakout of a long-term downtrend and then you put all the fundamental stories that the last guest just mentioned. And yeah, this is a recipe where if you want to get in this name, riskreward, there&#39;s much greater reward on the horizon than the risks. Now, we&#39;ll see what the secession line is, but uh something tells me Iger is going to do this one a little bit better than he did the last time he left Disney. and uh that shareholders that have been holding on are\n### MISCELLANEOUS\nWe also showed our viewers while you were speaking, Jay, uh Uber, you like Uber, you say that this is a stock that&#39;s going to be 120 bucks by the end of the year.\n### MACRO_DATA_SLIDES\nEvery single new bit of positive news. Now they&#39;ve covered the shorts. Now they have to chase up. They did not believe this was going to take place. They&#39;re g every single headline. And by the way, earnings earnings growth was double what was expected. Even in the face of uncertainty, now that we have more certainty, guess what&#39;s going to happen? Upgrades. Upgrades to guidance. They&#39;re going to have to buy more and more and more. Like Donald Trump said, the market is going higher.\n### HEADLINES_AND_NEWS\nwe are still in this this tariff environment. We have this 90-day pause with China, which is good news for a company like Walmart. We&#39;re getting Walmart earnings tomorrow. That&#39;s going to be at 7:00 a.m. Eastern time. You say that that Walmart is going to be the barometer for the tariff trade because of how that they characterize they handle what has been the last quarter for them, which of course was concerns about their supply chain. Yeah, I think we&#39;re still a far way from certainty in this market. We&#39;re getting a little more certain, but uh there are a lot more\n\n analysts. Analysts will start to upgrade. You&#39;re seeing it now. All the PE, you know, it&#39;s funny seeing these reports from different different sellside houses. One week they&#39;re saying recession chances high. The next week they&#39;re saying no recession and they&#39;re just adapting to this and companies now are going to come off the sidelines. They&#39;ve been paused. They&#39;ve just been saying we&#39;re not doing anything. We&#39;re not making any investments for the last four, six weeks. Now, you&#39;re going to see CEO confidence, CFO confidence. And by the way, what&#39;s so interesting, we had record buyback announcements year to date? 665 billion. So while hedge funds were selling in the hole, guess who was buying? Corporations believe in the future. Even in the face of all that uncertainty, they were putting their money to work to buy shares in this is going to be a positive thing prospectively. Um the other thing I&#39;m curious about is additional trade deals. None of them are actual deals, by the way. They&#39;re all framework. They&#39;re all plans to make a deal. Yeah. Well, here they&#39;re not details. All I&#39;m asking is, are we going to get diminishing returns from these announcements going forward? I mean, China was really the big one. China was the the big one. Europe will be very, very important. But at the end of the day, here&#39;s the thing. If if President Trump had come out and said, &quot;We&#39;re going to charge everyone 10%.&quot; Okay? There&#39;s no way he would have ended up with 10%. So, he came out, he threw a grenade in the room, he blew up the entire system. and he said, &quot;We&#39;re going to tariff you 145%. We&#39;re going to tariff you 80%.&quot; Now 10% looks like the deal of the century and it&#39;s an additional three $400 billion into our coffers. So uh\n### MISCELLANEOUS\nwith that said  that we&#39;re paying for well that&#39;s questionable because you know we had tariffs that were put into place in 2018 2019 that&#39;s a very different place for inflation. you saw diff disinflationary. So like washing machines, whirlpool, the price went up like literally shortterm for a matter of months. 2 years later, the price per unit was actually lower. So there&#39;s something to be said. I I think it&#39;s the perfect balance. You get a little rebalance. Look, China wants to move to a consumption-led economy by 2030. That is an explicit government mandate. They want to move to 70% consumption just like the rest of the developed world. We want to increase our manufacturing percentage. we we&#39;re already at that level of consumption. So, this rebalance is natural and it makes sense. I&#39;m very interested in what they&#39;re talking about as it relates to the currency kind of kind of lowering the value of the US dollar because that also helps alleviate some of the imbalances. There were rumblings earlier in the year. Remember the Mara Lago accord where they&#39;d have a a a summit like they had in the in the mid 80s where they de you know devalued the dollar. I don&#39;t know that that&#39;s going to be part of it per se, but I think that&#39;s the trend. We&#39;re going to get a counter trend bounce here in the dollar because everyone&#39;s bearish on the dollar now after everyone was bullish. And then we&#39;re probably going to continue lower which is going to be great for S&amp;P earnings which is going to help rebalance the trade and we&#39;re going to be okay. What could go wrong you like you sound like everything is perfect, Tom? Well, look, I look at businesses company by company. We did a client conference call April 7th, okay? And I went through every single company. And I went through their balance sheet, their liquidity, their cash flow, their revenues, and all of these things were going up. The only thing that had changed is the\n\n### MISCELLANEOUS\nnesses that we love. So, first thing you need to do if you&#39;re buying stocks that are down a lot is uh and I know this is foreign because everyone today this weekend talked to you about buying stocks that are already up a lot is do can they meet their upcoming debt obligations? Do they have enough free cash flow to service the debt? When is the maturity of those debt instruments? Okay. And if you can get comfort that look, they&#39;ve got three, four years of runway, they&#39;re going to figure it out. they&#39;re going to turn around or the cycle itself is going to take care of it. Uh then you&#39;re golden. Next is is the moat durable? Does the company have a sustainable competitive advantage? And do they have a history of performing well through through economic cycles? So I don&#39;t like one that&#39;s hasn&#39;t been through any real tests. That worries me because uh I I don&#39;t know what&#39;s going to happen. I like just seeing ones that have a natural rhythm. I can see the trends of the free cash flow over time. I can see the trends of the revenue over time. I can see the trends of the earnings over time. I can see the balance sheet over time. I can see the share count over time. Uh and that leads to the next one which is management. Do they prioritize shareholder value? Uh are their incentives aligned with shareholders? Are they issuing themselves a ton of stock and diluting me, making my uh uh slice in the pie smaller at their own benefit, or do they respect equity? Are they buying shares in? Is the share count going down? Is my slice of the pie getting bigger without putting more money into the investment? That&#39;s the type of management I like. They respect equity. They&#39;re not doing equity offerings and diluting people and screwing your position for their own benefit because all they care about is their salary. And that&#39;s very common in the smaller stocks, in the promoted stocks, in the high-flying stocks. You have to be careful. And then finally , is there a near-term catalyst, a significant catalyst that could unlock value? I like to bet on jockeyies. I like to have a turnaround CEO who has a past track track record of success. Um, they could spin off divisions. They could sell non-core assets to raise cash and pay down debt to give them three years of runway to turn around. These are critically important for turnaround situations. Uh, which we just absolutely love to do because you can with regularity double and triple and quadruple your money in great businesses in a reasonable time horizon of two, three, four years and make a significant IRRa. So, we&#39;re effectively underwriting public securities where most people just get hypnotized by the price movements in the short term as if we were buying the whole business. So like private equity in the public markets type of framework analysis. Okay, here. So what&#39;s our edge? Okay, anyone can buy cheap stocks. Every time you purchase a stock, someone else is selling. And you know the funny part is you both think you&#39;re smart. Okay, so we believe we have two key advantages. First and foremost, our time horizon. We take a longer term view. Most people are thinking in days, weeks, and months. We&#39;re thinking in years. Our average holding period is 12 uh 12 12 months up to five years. Some double and triple much faster than we expect. Some take a little bit longer. Um but over a portfolio of 8 to 12 stocks, we run a concentrated portfolio. Uh there have been very few people to ever outperform with more than 15 stocks. Um so that&#39;s how we run it and we take patience and we do we don&#39;t use leverage. So, we&#39;re not getting margin calls. We&#39;re not getting stopped out. We&#39;re not getting uh uh phased out by short-term\n\n### MISCELLANEOUS\nfinally , is there a near-term catalyst, a significant catalyst that could unlock value? I like to bet on jockeyies.

Um so that's how we run it and we take patience and we do we don't use leverage. So, we're not getting margin calls. We're not getting stopped out. We're not getting uh uh phased out by short-term headlines  because the price moves 4% in the pre-market. And we're like, \"Whoa, what does everyone else know that we don't?\" We just go back. We look at the cash flow statement. We look at their uh revenue growth. We look at their earnings growth. We say they don't know anything. They're just responding to\n\nheadlines  because the price moves 4% in the pre-market. And we're like, \"Whoa, what does everyone else know that we don't?\" We just go back. We look at the cash flow statement. We look at their uh revenue growth. We look at their earnings growth. We say they don't know anything. They're just responding to headlines . Should we add to the position? Should we take this the shares off their hand?\n\nmanagement is imperative. Uh we have a company called which we&#39;re not going to talk about today which now we are because you guys stayed the extra hour called VF Corp. Anyone familiar with VF Corp? They&#39;ve been around since 189 something 93 95 125 years. What they have a DNA for doing is buying and selling brands. Okay. So right now the brands in their stable are Northbased, Timberland, Vans, okay, a company called Vans. And Vans has gotten hit extremely hard because they oversupplied during COVID. It was super popular. Everyone bought three pairs of Vans, very similar to Nike with the Air Force Ones. Uh, and then and the Air Jordans. And then it went through three years of decline. They brought in a new CEO. His name is Bracken Daryl. And the thing you need to know about Bracken Daryl, and I&#39;m trying to emphasize this point about management. Bracken Daryl has a background at Proctor and Gamble, at Old Spice. He&#39;s a brand manager. He&#39;s exceptional at it. He came into a little company called Logitech. Okay. And this is the cancer curing products that they made at Logitech. Okay. Complete commodity product. Nothing revolutionary about a mouse or a webcam. He came in when the stock was down 82% just like he came in at BF Corp with the stock down 82%. Uh in the next 10 years it was a 28 bagger. A million dollars became $28 million selling this that you could get anywhere. Why is that a Logitech? Okay. Because he understood branding. He understood operations. He understood supply chain management. He&#39;s a winner. You want to bet on the jockey. So you may say, &quot;Oh, Vans will never come back.&quot; Bracken will bring it back. He&#39;s he&#39;s worked through the channels. Now he&#39;s going to ramp it up. He&#39;s going to start bringing in the creators and the the influencers and the the whole marketing plan. You&#39;re going to see massive action. Northace is a recovery on China. It&#39;s doing well. Timberlin the same thing. So this is the type of bet. So when you&#39;re buying a stock down and what did he do? He sold off Supreme for over a billion dollars to pay down debt to delever the balance sheet. Why? To get multi-year runway to run the turnaround plan and not get stopped out in the meantime. So that&#39;s the type of things that we like to look at. So near-term catalyst, etc. Um, the key with these is the temperament. So, I&#39;m known as Turnaround Tom because I like to buy good businesses when they&#39;re marked down. Uh, but you have to have a certain level of ice in your veins. So, like I I keep going with the the nickname that people gave me, but they&#39;re starting to give me the Iceman name, okay? because they&#39;ve seen me with, you know, stocks down and I&#39;m like, &quot;Yeah, what&#39;s the problem?&quot; People like, &quot;Are you sure we should own this?&quot; And then like four months later, you know, we were buying Vornnado uh during the mini banking crisis. What was that? March of 2023 and they were throwing banks baby out when um Silicon National Bank collapsed and they were throwing out everything with the bathwater. The the last thing you could talk to people about buying is an office read. Okay? I mean, but what did we do? We saw the dislocation and we picked the highest quality business in the most dislocated market. So, if office was going to be destroyed, which there was a compelling case for that to be to happen, which by the way it hasn&#39;t, which was the camp we were in, but we had to assume that it was going to happen, that we weren&#39;t smarter than 99% of the people that said office was over. Who would be left standing? There would be some offices left and what would be left would be the highest quality in the basket and that&#39;s what Hornado owned in New York, all the best locations, etc. And then I could bet on the jockey, Steve Roth, multi-billionaire. Uh, everyone I spoke to that knew him said the same thing. The guy&#39;s like 80. He will not die until his stock is back at all-time highs. I can assure you that. And that&#39;s what I got from and I met this guy uh in 2010 at an idea launch and this guy was no nonsense. You you have to know who you&#39;re betting on is what I&#39;m saying. You need a good quality business, a stable balance sheet to get through the downturn and a good jockey to turn it around. Okay? And the temperament to wait it out. And this temperament comes also. How many of you trade on or invest on margin or leverage? Yeah. So that&#39;s where you get stopped out because if you if you if if a stock is temporarily down 20% against you, you might be down 40%. And you might not be you might have relinquished the decision to someone else called a margin clerk as to whether or not you could continue to have ICE in your veins and stick it through until Bracken Works turns your million bucks into 28 million bucks with nothing break through here at all. or if the margin clerk takes your money and sells your shares down 40% to a guy like me who&#39;s sitting in cash waiting for this for the shares. Okay? So, you want to be on my side of the table, not that side. And the way you guarantee that is very low to zero margin. If you buy these stocks, right, you will make more than enough money. You don&#39;t have to get people who get hurt are people who try to get rich too fast. Okay? When you slow it down and the older you get, I know I look young, the longer my time horizon is, and the wealthier I&#39;ve become. When I was young, I wanted to be on margin. I wanted to get rich and make a million bucks in a week. If I just buy these uh zero day options and the market goes up 5%, I can make up, you know, 10 million, whatever. and you wind up wiped out. And most people don&#39;t make it through that and they&#39;re they&#39;re out. And if they just understood the right principles at the beginning, buy great businesses when they&#39;re at good prices and wait and don&#39;t be on margin. Don&#39;t give your decision to wait to the margin clerk who&#39;s going to make it the decision for you. Small portion that&#39;s okay. Even Charlie liked a little bit of leverage. So, uh, Charlie Munger that is. So, that&#39;s that. That&#39;s temperament. What does uninvestable mean? The term uninvestable is music to our ears. It tells us that an asset or market has become perceived as so uncertain, so risky, and fearful that it&#39;s easier to slap the label uninvestable on it, regardless of the fundamentals or valuation. That&#39;s critical. That&#39;s why Jeff put it in a different color font. Okay. regardless of the fundamentals or valuation just to avoid the scrutiny,\n\nIf you buy these stocks, right, you will make more than enough money.

Okay. regardless of the fundamentals or valuation just to avoid the scrutiny, headlines\n\nI got rich on Bitcoin, I'm so happy for you. That's great. It's outside of my lane. It's not what I do, okay? Uh I got rich on Nvidia. Congratulations. I'm so happy for you. It's outside of my lane. I just like these double, triple, quadruples. great businesses. I can sleep at night. Boeing at $130. Disney at $85. I don't need to think about these things. I don't need to stay up at night staring at the ceiling. Is Disney gonna stay in business? Okay. In the way it works in America is if you don't bring your children to Disneyland at least or world at least two or three times, child services comes to your house. They take your children and they take them away and they give them to new parents and they lock you up for being an abusive parent because you haven't taken your children to Disneyland. And that's never going to change. Okay. Uh the parks, the the cruises, they've got 180 million sub uh streamers, which is half of what Netflix has. Netflix has like three times the valuation. Oh, and by the way, we got the parks, we got the cruises, we've got the ESPN growing like wildfire. So things like that.\n\n### MISCELLANEOUS\nif it&#39;s now, don&#39;t worry about your stocks. Uh and if uh if Wells Fargo cease to exist, that would be as as close to the end of the world as you could get. So that was a no-brainer. Yeah. Uh we hold stocks between 12 one year and five years, but I&#39;d say three years is kind of the average uh turnaround period. Yeah. Some go super fast like Monado was a quick double. That was one of the few that did it in less than a year and that was frustrating because we had to pay taxes, but it wasn't something that was a hold forever stock and we're like, you know what, take the win and move on. But usually it's going to take well more than 12 months. So, we're we're comfortable to like Cooper Standard, we started building at $5 and change in May of 2022. Uh that's now a five bagger off those, but we're three years in and we don't even think the story's begun. We think it's going to double again from here. So, that's going to take probably five years till we're fully out or, you know, getting out. But the return on capital is insane. So we're always looking at the tradeoff for internal rate of return has to be in excess of what we're measured against. Uh so if that time creeps too long and it starts to impact our IR that's something we we're cognizant of and by the same token if the IRRa is insane in a short period of time we have to harvest some of that. Um it's a balancing act. It's uh they were asking earlier what's going to happen to analysts with AI and I said you know the mediocre ones are going to be toast but that type of analysis like it can be done by machines but there's so much nuance. I remember when I worked at Cornwall and I'd like I'd sit down with them and I'd pitch him on an idea and my pitch would be like I don't know five minutes and then the guy who was played by Brad Pitt in the movie he would start asking me\n\nguidance is right around 265. So about down 3.6%. We're kind of holding it at those levels. So\n\n### MISCELLANEOUS\n\nwith that said , let's move on to the\n\n wants to be short Cooper Standard. And uh on a margin compression thesis, um I&#39;m just going to say I&#39;ll take the other side of that trade and let&#39;s see where we are in 12 months, ladies and gentlemen. Uh good luck with that one. Joe Vandy, EW scripts, SSP, assuming this is like a TV company or something. Let&#39;s see. Free cash flow revenues. Huh? What do these guys do? Must have a lot of debt. Yeah, national news and entertainment. There&#39;s a bunch of these. God, this is a tough business. This is a cigar butt business. I&#39;m guessing the balance sheet looks like death. 23 million of cash, 2.7 billion of debt. Go to Las Vegas Sands. Bet it all on black. This is not for me. It might work as a trade. I&#39;m not going to participate and I&#39;m not going to lose sleep if you get rich on it. Error of omission, not commission. Rule number one, don&#39;t lose money. Rule number two, don&#39;t forget rule number one. Charles River Labs from Martin GR ZY W Grizzki. Say that three times fast. CRL This is going to take a while. This is a broken Momo stock. I know it&#39;s down a lot. Look at cash flow, though. Record highs. Margins compressing. Show me how margins are going to turn around. Uh, I think you&#39;re probably going to be right. And I think it&#39;s going to take a lot longer than you think to turn around. Lot of broken people here. Uh let&#39;s take a look at the balance sheet just so we can take solveny risk off the table hopefully. 2.7 billion in debt. How much cash? Something&#39;s hurting with the model. So you got to get comfort in the business before you invest a dollar. 194 in cash. 2.2 billion in debt. This is not a great great situation. Uh understand why it&#39;s down so much. What&#39;s the turnaround plan? You&#39;re going to have to do work on this one because they don&#39;t have all the time in the world with that balance sheet. They probably have some time, but not all the time.",
    "### MISCELLANEOUS": "\n\nheadlines . Should we add to the position? Should we take this the shares off their hand? And\n\n---\n\nfinally\n\nthe podcast video cast. I would strongly suggest that if you didn&#39;t write it down, hedge fun tips with Tom Hayes. You can find it anywhere you get your podcast or on YouTube is best. And the reason it&#39;s great on YouTube is because I go through 10 20 uh what do we do like 50 pages of data charts, fundamental stuff, macroeconomic stuff every single week. So, if you can see the charts when I&#39;m talking about demographics, if you can see the charts when I&#39;m talking about earnings, it&#39;s it&#39;s helpful. If you listen, it&#39;s great, too. I know people like to exercise and walk around while they do podcast, but you&#39;ll get significantly more value doing it that way. Welcome. Um, we&#39;ll talk about this. I can&#39;t overemphasize these four points and I know I did it in the previous presentation but owing Corning the only thing I have to look at is the balance sheet. So how much cash do they have? How much debt do they have? What&#39;s their free cash flow to service that interest payment? And when do the different debt maturities come due? And if you can get comfortable like by with that you see the free cash flow trends are pretty stable then yeah it&#39;s a home run. You might even buy a few more shares at that level as well. Yeah, exactly. Um, you know what? Go to hedge funips.com, click on the contact button, and you will see that you can write in your name and you&#39;ll see click AMA for\n\n\nbet tech bet in the 2022 bare market. Two things people think about Tom Hayes. Number one, they think I&#39;m a permable because they know me publicly since it&#39;s been time to be a permable. Uh and number two, they think I hate tech and I only buy factories and boring businesses. Uh and the answer is it couldn&#39;t be farther from the truth. I buy what&#39;s on sale that&#39;s high quality when it&#39;s on sale. And in this recent tech pullback, I would call it a pullback for Mag 7. The reason I didn&#39;t jump all over if if you had put a gun to my head in early April when we were buying a ton of stocks, um I think I even mentioned on the podcast like I could see a scenario where Mag 7 really moves. I don&#39;t think the underlying earnings power prospectively because the amount of capex they have and how that&#39;s going to crowd out buybacks uh is going to justify them trading above the top of the range. So on that basis for me to take that risk for only 30 to 40% quick return is not worth it. Like if something can&#39;t be a double or triple or quadruple in a reasonable amount of time, you know, handful of years or much less, I&#39;m not allocating a dollar of capital because I think in any investment there there&#39;s things you can know and there&#39;s things that you don&#39;t know that you don&#39;t know and maybe can&#39;t know. How many of you knew United Healthcare was committing Medicare fraud? If they were, we don&#39;t know yet. You&#39;re going to stick around and find out. I mean, if you&#39;re holding the stock and you&#39;re like, &quot;Well, I&#39;ll bet they didn&#39;t commit fraud and the DOJ is just going on a fishing expedition.&quot; It&#39;s like, &quot;That&#39;s kind of gambling.&quot; You know, I had clients ask me because I like to buy stocks. I was like, &quot;Under $200 a share? I might be willing to assume that gambling risk, but uh not yet.&quot; that could be a quick recovery. Uh but that goes in my two too hard box like I how can I have an edge? So the point I&#39;m making in that context is that&#39;s why you know our highest conviction idea is not 100% of the portfolio. Now we&#39;re concentrated 8 10 12 stocks uh but we accept the risk that any one of those stock so when I size positions here&#39;s another filter besides owning the entire business is if this position went to zero would they take me out on a stretcher and if the answer is yes the sizing is too large and I&#39;m I&#39;m being a cowboy so I&#39;ll never take that risk if The answer is no. The other nine positions in the portfolio are all going to be doubles and triples. If this goes to zero, it doesn&#39;t matter. I&#39;ll still outperform. Then the answer is yes. You&#39;re sizing it correctly. And you have to go into that assumption in every single investment that there could be things that you don&#39;t know that you don&#39;t know. UNH is a monstrous business. This is not some shy, you know, insurance agent on the corner selling away some policy that they shouldn&#39;t have sold. This is like serious stuff and you have to have that assumption. So if everyone is crowding into one stock and you&#39;re like, &quot;Oh, if I just buy you that stock,&quot; that&#39;s how you really get hurt. So you even no matter how good your research is, no matter how high your conviction, no matter how high the margin of safety is in the business, there can always be a risk that you don&#39;t know that you don&#39;t know. And there&#39;s no way you could possibly know. No matter how good you&#39;re you are as an analyst, it&#39;s just a black swan. think they&#39;re in the Dow. Sorry. Might get kicked out. Uh I don&#39;t know. But if they did get kicked out, it would take a while. And those stocks have a tendency to outperform in the next 12 months. So that would probably be a trigger for me to take a closer look. I got to be honest with you. Um so 2022 marked the third worst year ever for tech. Only behind the dot crash and the great financial crisis. Nearly 2.5 trillion in market value was wiped out and tech layoffs at their highest level since 2000. The post-pandemic capex and hiring spree in tech was quickly replaced by the fastest Fed tighten tightening cycle since the 1980s ending ZERP zero interest rate policy. And we&#39;ve covered that in my panel on Friday. We covered that a little today. If you are going to be exclusively growth because that&#39;s what&#39;s worked in the last 15 years, you are making an implicit bet that you believe rates are going back down to 2% or 1%. Because historically that is when growth outperforms and you&#39;re like, well, there haven&#39;t been that many periods that rates have been at 1% or 2%. Well, news flash, there haven&#39;t been that many periods where growth has outperformed value. It just happens to be the last 15 years. You know, it&#39;s funny. I talked to a new client. I said, uh, I said, &#39; Let&#39;s turn this around. You want me to grow your money, right? Like, yes. I said, how about if we did an exercise and you came to me and you said, Tom, I&#39;ve got $10 million. I want to see how quickly you can lose it in 24 months. I&#39;d say, no problem. Here&#39;s how you do it. All you have to do is buy a basket of 20 stocks trading at 10 times sales or greater and making no money. And I guarantee you&#39;re going to lose 90% of your money in the next 24 months except the last 15 years. That basket of stocks has outperformed the S&amp;P 500. Every other 10-year period before ZERP, you were guaranteed to lose 90% of your money. That was like a no-brainer. And now that&#39;s all anyone&#39;s excited to buy. Ria, an RAIA usually is doing like estate planning. They&#39;re doing uh when are you going to retire? What you know planning goals for your kids. I come from a hedge fund manager background. So we run the same strategies. Uh concentrated portfolio 85 90% 8 to 10 to 12 stocks. 10 to 15% is in a derivative overlay for excess returns without drawing major leverage. And we also use that bucket for hedging and dampening volatility from time to time when we think the market is dramatically overvalued but there are no companies that we&#39;re ready to harvest yet. We&#39;ll use that to to do some hedging as well. Okay. Um so we saw the panic as a generational okay post pandemic capex hiring spree. We saw that as a generational buy opportunity picking up Amazon during its worst year since 20 2000 and Google after both were cut in half that year. This was Google and Amazon cut in half. now um and investors puked in the hole and you couldn&#39;t give away a tech stock because what free money all the VC money crowded in in 2021 uh chasing ridiculous ideas and ridiculous deals that weren&#39;t making money as you got forced liquidations and the business plans didn&#39;t play out. These were a source of funds for many private investors. Those were a double in about a year and a half. Both stocks are essentially flat since we exited. Okay. Now, the most uninvestable opportunity ever is China. And uh this is one of the category that takes longer than expected. This has not been a vornnado. Okay? This has been a multi-year thing. We started in the hundreds uh and we bought all the way down to the 60s. And that was a scary day. I remember because it went to 59. Rob probably remembers it. Remembers the podcast. Rob&#39;s been listening to the podcast for three plus years. Jeff probably remembers it. Um and we brought our basis across all accounts down to $82 and change. And um and the reason we were able to do that is because no leverage. No one took the decision out of our hands as it was collapsing because Xihinping was soldering people into their homes in their apartments so they couldn&#39;t leave their apartments during COVID. I mean, but they were still generating $20 billion of free cash flow. Had eight billion $80 billion of cash on their balance sheet. So did they have the runway? Yes. effectively no net no net debt because they had $80 billion of cash and I think it was like what $18 billion of debt at the time something like that so they had the runway they still had the growth they still had the free cash flow what they didn&#39;t have was investor flows foreign investor flows they didn&#39;t have uh excitement they didn&#39;t have FOMO but that&#39;s when we like to to buy stocks okay uh you can see all the",
    "### FEATURED_COMPANY_DEEP_DIVES": "\n\nthe podcast video cast. I would strongly suggest that if you didn&#39;t write it down, hedge fun tips with Tom Hayes. You can find it anywhere you get your podcast or on YouTube is best. And the reason it&#39;s great on YouTube is because I go through 10 20 uh what do we do like 50 pages of data charts, fundamental stuff, macroeconomic stuff every single week. So, if you can see the charts when I&#39;m talking about demographics, if you can see the charts when I&#39;m talking about earnings, it&#39;s it&#39;s helpful. If you listen, it&#39;s great, too. I know people like to exercise and walk around while they do podcast, but you&#39;ll get significantly more value doing it that way. Welcome. Um, we&#39;ll talk about this. I can&#39;t overemphasize these four points and I know I did it in the previous presentation but owing Corning the only thing I have to look at is the balance sheet. So how much cash do they have? How much debt do they have? What&#39;s their free cash flow to service that interest payment? And when do the different debt maturities come due? And if you can get comfortable like by with that you see the free cash flow trends are pretty stable then yeah it&#39;s a home run. You might even buy a few more shares at that level as well. Yeah, exactly. Um, you know what? Go to hedge funips.com, click on the contact button, and you will see that you can write in your name and you&#39;ll see click AMA for\n\n\nenergy was left for dead in 2020. It had been the worst performing sector of 2019. Lowest S&P waiting on record at 3.5%. Highest short interest in nearly 20 years and it was trading at less than half the market multiple. If you want to talk about uninvestable and career risk, if you were a pension manager, if you were a money manager running money for pensions and you owned an energy stock in 2020, you were probably getting a pink slip because it was all about renewables. It was all all about we&#39;re going to, you know, uh, put up all these wind turbines and solar panels and all this fantasy land stuff, which is great. We need all of it and we need more than ever, natural gas, uh, etc. But it had gotten so extreme and the boat had shifted so far and we said, you know, this is a problem. Uh, but how do we benefit from this without taking abnormal risk? And what I thought about was one, I thought it was ridiculous that we weren&#39;t going to need energy for the next decade or two decades. I mean, you had to buy some of the story. It was so pronounced. It was so strong. The sentiment was so uniformly convinced that we were not going to use oil anymore and we were all going to be in electric vehicles. And I said, &quot;What if they&#39;re right, how do I participate and still make money?&quot; And I said, &quot;Let&#39;s just buy the one that will be left standing if they&#39;re right about everything. One of them is going to be left standing in the tradition in the transition. Let&#39;s buy Exxon Mobile at $33 a share. Paying a dividend. World is shut down. Not a complicated decision because if Exxon goes, I have a lot more to worry about than my stock portfolio because if we&#39;re not pumping energy and we&#39;re not keeping the lights on and uh people have stopped moving, you know, last thing I&#39;m going to be worried about is my stock portfolio. So, yeah. That&#39;s a good question. I don&#39;t Six or seven. You remember in the 40s? Yeah. Six or seven in the You bought it in the 40s. Yeah. So, it must have been eight. So, there was a real risk they were going to cut the dividend and I fully accepted that. I mean, any stock that drops that much. I&#39;m not buying for the dividend. I&#39;m buying for the turnaround. Every now and then, they keep the dividend. Like, uh, we didn&#39;t have time to talk uh Jeff had noted 4.4% 4% dividend yield on Stanley Black &amp; Decker right now and the stock is down 80% 80%. So might they cut it? Yeah. But the fact that they&#39;ve taken almost $2 billion of cost out of the business and the revenues are starting to reacelerate. You probably get that lock it in. They keep growing the dividend over time. They&#39;ve cut it a little bit. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So um Yeah. So what was it at peak, right? Like 8% or something. Yeah. When the stock had dropped. So that happens in those situations. But once the business stabilize, what do they start doing? Increasing the dividend again. So on your basis, it starts to really compound. I mean, Buffett gets annual dividends close to the total amount of basis he invested in Coca-Cola in 1989. It&#39;s unreal. And it keeps growing every single year with ah adjusted. It&#39;s It&#39;s complicated, but cheaper than now. I&#39;ll put it that way. Um, okay. So, that was Exxon, and we didn&#39;t get the the exact bottom. I think the bottom was $25. Um, we got it 33 blended, and we didn&#39;t get the top. Uh, I think we sold it below 100. It&#39;s now 105. But, you know, it wasn&#39;t a 10bagger. It wasn&#39;t Nvidia making 50 times your money. that was like you don&#39;t have to think hard about. Another one we did during the uh COVID was Wells Fargo. Wells Fargo three times in history it traded below 50% of tangible book. Okay, we built a huge position at $2510. And if the world was going to end, our view was that probably JP Morgan, probably Wells Fargo and and possibly Bank of America would be left standing. Okay. Uh, so JP Morgan didn&#39;t come come down enough that we felt like we were getting paid for the amount of risk we were taking. Wells Fargo came down enough that we&#39;re like, &quot;Yeah, this this is not going to be hard.&quot; And it went up to the high 50s very very quickly, got out at 57 and that that&#39;s that. But we didn&#39;t have to think hard about that because if Wells Fargo ceased to exist, you know, I like to say that the end of the world only comes once. Uh and if it&#39;s now, don&#39;t worry about your stocks. Uh and if uh if Wells Fargo cease to exist, that would be as as close to the end of the world as you could get. So that was a no-brainer. Yeah. Uh we hold stocks between 12 one year and five years, but I&#39;d say three years is kind of the average uh turnaround period. Yeah. Some go super fast like Monado was a quick double. That was one of the few that did it in less than a year and that was frustrating because we had to pay taxes, but it wasn&#39;t something that was a hold forever stock and we&#39;re like, you know what, take the win and move on. But usually it&#39;s going to take well more than 12 months. So, we&#39;re we&#39;re comfortable to like Cooper Standard, we started building at $5 and change in May of 2022. Uh that&#39;s now a five bagger off those, but we&#39;re three years in and we don&#39;t even think the story&#39;s begun. We think it&#39;s going to double again from here. So, that&#39;s going to take probably five years till we&#39;re fully out or, you know, getting out. But the return on capital is insane. So we&#39;re always looking at the tradeoff for internal rate of return has to be in excess of what we&#39;re measured against. Uh so if that time creeps too long and it starts to impact our IR that&#39;s something we we&#39;re cognizant of and by the same token if the IRRa is insane in a short period of time we have to harvest some of that. Um it&#39;s a balancing act. It&#39;s uh they were asking earlier what&#39;s going to happen to analysts with AI and I said you know the mediocre ones are going to be toast but that type of analysis like it can be done by machines but there&#39;s so much nuance. I remember when I worked at Cornwall and I&#39;d like I&#39;d sit down with them and I&#39;d pitch him on an idea and my pitch would be like I don&#39;t know five minutes and then the guy who was played by Brad Pitt in the movie he would start asking me",
    "### HEADLINES_AND_NEWS": "\n\ncareer risk of going against the crowd. So most people are structured, most active managers are what we call closet indexers. Their whole job is to collect assets and stay in business. Because if they collect assets and stay in business, they have an annuity that goes up over time in perpetuity because what happens? the market goes up over time in perpetuity. So if they can if they don&#39;t zigg too far from consensus and it they have a downyear, they get to keep their job because they didn&#39;t do worse by taking an unconventional bet. You as individual investors don&#39;t have those constraints on you. You can buy and underwrite an individual business like we talked about in the main room and you don&#39;t have to worry about the short-term volatility, the short-term marktomarket, uh the job risk that some of the managers uh closet indexers have and why they stick. So what closet indexing means is that they hug very closely to the index that they&#39;re measured against. So most managers are measured against the S&amp;P. You&#39;ll notice that the top five weights of the X and S&amp;P are X, Y, and Z, MAG 7 mostly. You&#39;ll notice that most active managers have the same stocks. Okay? So, you&#39;re just paying more fees for effectively the same outcome. Um, so we we run things very differently, very similar to how Warren Buffett managed money for outside clients before he rolled it into the public company and had different types of constraints. So he was doing a lot more turnarounds, a lot more quick doubles and triples in his private partnerships than he was able to do in the big because once he got the insurance float, he had too much money to put to work that he couldn&#39;t be quite as nimble two, three years. He was more interested in 10 years or forever if he could do it because that insurance float just kept coming in and coming in and coming in. Okay. Um different asset classes and sectors have been deemed uninvestable many times throughout market history. financials after the great financial crisis. What was the best trade you could have possibly made after the March 2009 lows? You know, financials, City Bank, Bank of America, JP Morgan, etc. Uh they were completely quote uninvestable. People kept waiting for the retest of the lows, etc. Uh tech stocks following the dot crash and energy during the pandemic. Does anyone remember when energy prices went negative? In theory, they would pay you to take oil from them. Okay? You can&#39;t make this stuff up. Uh so we&#39;ll tell you what we did during that. Uh uninvestable is often profitable. Taking the opposite side of most crowded trades historically has generated excess returns averaging 7 to 19% annually over periods ranging from 8 to 22 years. Since 1994, Morning Stars unloved sectors, those with the most outflows in the prior years. Remember in the previous presentation I talked about the last shall be first. That was our theme going into this year. The LA the worst performing last year international uh non-magnificent seven uh value going into this year. Those were our themes and those have been the big big outperformers this year. Okay. So with this uh Morning Stars quote unquote unloved sectors returned 10.96 annually nearly doubling the 5.57% from the quote loved sectors i.e. the ones that had the most inflows in the year before. Okay. It&#39;s it&#39;s just human nature to want to chase what&#39;s already worked because you feel like it&#39s safe. It&#39;s already working. Uh it&#39;s not risky. But actually those are the riskiest things unfortunately and that&#39;s why you see this divergence of underperformance. So we look back here to uh 200 we got here uh basically what is this? It&#39;s a little blurry but this talks about oil relative uh energy stocks versus the rest of the market. Talks about tech stocks versus cash. talks about um energy stocks pre great financial crisis when they were on that run and you can see these extremes always work themselves out. So everyone gets excited. So what what do you think would be most loved right now? I&#39;m asking you. I don&#39;t know the answer to this question. What do you guys think everyone&#39;s super excited about? Go ahead. Semiconductors. Okay. Yeah. Certainly last year and Nvidia peaked at uh June 20th. I remember because we wrote an article on June 20th. You can check hedge funips.com. And the thumbnail of the article was a picture of Jensen Wong signing a fan&#39;s brazier and I knew that was the short-term top. Uh I&#39;ve been to this movie a few times and the stock has actually not made new highs since that point. It may go on to make it but that&#39;s almost a year of dead money and it had quite a big draw down maybe 40% from that point at one at one point 35 40%. Okay. So, semiconductors, anything else people are super excited about? AI. Yeah, a lot of hype in AI. And I think all that stuff is going to come true. The question is on a company by company basis, are you already paying for the best case scenario if everything they say comes true is already going to be true? If you&#39;re paying a hundred times sales for a stock, you know, that&#39;s pretty amazing. I if if you went to buy the local car wash and the seller is like, &quot;Uh, yeah, I&#39;ll sell the business to you.&quot; And you&#39;re like, &quot;Okay, what did you do last year?&quot; And he&#39;s like, &quot;Well, we did, you know, we did about a million dollars, about 80,000 a month.&quot; And he&#39;s like, &quot;All right, that&#39;s pretty good.&quot; You&#39;re thinking, &quot;All right, what did you earn?&quot; Well, we earned about $300,000 on that million dollars of sales. That&#39;s pretty good business. You know, you might offer him one and a half million, two million bucks. But he comes back and he says, &quot;Uh, yeah, we&#39;re going to grow like crazy. We&#39;re going to buy up every single thing. Uh, we want a hundred million for that $300,000 of earnings power.&quot; And you may say, &quot;Yeah, this guy&#39;s pretty charismatic. He could probably buy 10 more. Maybe he&#39;ll buy 20 more.&quot; Uh, but if you pay a hundred million, I guarantee you you&#39;re already paying for the best case scenario. So, if he only buys two more car washes, you&#39;re going to lose an awful lot of money if you pay him a hundred million. And you probably lose half your money even if he does buy every other car wash that he&#39;s talking about. And that&#39;s what you have to be careful of. You know, when God was Does anyone know what FOMO is? fear of missing out. So, I think it&#39;s genetic and and I think when God was handing out FOMO genes, he passed up Tom Hayes, okay? Because, you know, people I mean people I got rich on Bitcoin, I&#39;m so happy for you. That&#39;s great. It&#39;s outside of my lane. It&#39;s not what I do, okay? Uh I got rich on Nvidia. Congratulations. I&#39;m so happy for you. It&#39;s outside of my lane. I just like these double, triple, quadruples. great businesses. I can sleep at night. Boeing at $130. Disney at $85. I don&#39;t need to think about these things. I don&#39;t need to stay up at night staring at the ceiling. Is Disney gonna stay in business? Okay. In the way it works in America is if you don&#39;t bring your children to Disneyland at least or world at least two or three times, child services comes to your house. They take your children and they take them away and they give them to new parents and they lock you up for being an abusive parent because you haven&#39;t taken your children to Disneyland. And that&#39;s never going to change. Okay. Uh the parks, the the cruises, they&#39;ve got 180 million sub uh streamers, which is half of what Netflix has. Netflix has like three times the valuation. Oh, and by the way, we got the parks, we got the cruises, we&#39;ve got the ESPN growing like wildfire. So things like that.",

Um um and it could absolutely be a lot worse because you don&#39;t know, you know, where there&#39;s smoke. there could be fire and there&#39;s cockroaches behind the wall board. So, you have to but at some point it might be worth to get involved. It&#39;s just not now in my view even though you had all the insider buyers. Thou dot protestth. Um maybe it&#39;s all over in a week, but I don&#39;t think so. Department of Justice doesn&#39;t announce that and just let it go like our bad. They&#39;re clean back to back to business as normal. It&#39;s going to drag on and it&#39;s going to be an overhang for a while and a distraction. Hey Tom, thank you for sharing. BFIT, thank you for sharing the knowledge. You&#39;re the best. Thank you. That&#39;s very kind. BFI company is a lowcost gym operator. Market trend. Okay. So, it&#39;s basically a Planet Fitness, tons of cash, revenues, margins. Uh, this one might be a good one. I don&#39;t like the fattiness, no pun intang um the gym business. I&#39;ve seen them all come and go, but this one looks good for now. So, I think you&#39;re probably on to something and definitely worth doing the work on it and just know that that business is not a hold forever business. Maybe get a double out of it and call it a day. If that you just see the balance sheet and cash flow real quick, 58 million of cash, and then long-term debt is a billion. What&#39;s the free cash flow? So, that&#39;s something that&#39;s an alarm for me. I I I don&#39;t like that business generally. It looked decent at first blush, but as I look a little closer. I mean, the cash flow is pretty good. Maybe do more work. Ru Reynolds will mull. Oh, this 10-year-old at the Irone um wants to be short Cooper Standard. And uh on a margin compression thesis, um I&#39;m just going to say I&#39;ll take the other side of that trade and let&#39;s see where we are in 12 months, ladies and gentlemen. Uh good luck with that one. Joe Vandy, EW scripts, SSP, assuming this is like a TV company or something. Let&#39;s see. Free cash flow revenues. Huh? What do these guys do? Must have a lot of debt. Yeah, national news and entertainment. There&#39;s a bunch of these. God, this is a tough business. This is a cigar butt business. I&#39;m guessing the balance sheet looks like death. 23 million of cash, 2.7 billion of debt. Go to Las Vegas Sands. Bet it all on black. This is not for me. It might work as a trade. I&#39;m not going to participate and I&#39;m not going to lose sleep if you get rich on it. Error of omission, not commission. Rule number one, don&#39;t lose money. Rule number two, don&#39;t forget rule number one. Charles River Labs from Martin GR ZY W Grizzki. Say that three times fast. CRL This is going to take a while. This is a broken Momo stock. I know it&#39;s down a lot. Look at cash flow, though. Record highs. Margins compressing. Show me how margins are going to turn around. Uh, I think you&#39;re probably going to be right. And I think it&#39;s going to take a lot longer than you think to turn around. Lot of broken people here. Uh let&#39;s take a look at the balance sheet just so we can take solveny risk off the table hopefully. 2.7 billion in debt. How much cash? Something&#39;s hurting with the model. So you got to get comfort in the business before you invest a dollar. 194 in cash. 2.2 billion in debt. This is not a great great situation. Uh understand why it&#39;s down so much. What&#39;s the turnaround plan? You&#39;re going to have to do work on this one because they don&#39;t have all the time in the world with that balance sheet. They probably have some time, but not all the time. So,"

You both like Disney. There&#39;s no question about it. You know, uh, this rally that we&#39;ve seen in the last four weeks, it&#39;s like Buffett always said, if you wait for the Robins to sing, it&#39;s already spring. We&#39;re up 15% since Donald Trump tweeted. Now is a great time to buy stocks. Last week, he said US is going to boom. Disney is a beneficiary. We were on the network four weeks ago saying, &quot;Buy Disney at $85. It&#39;s 111.&quot; Guess what? It&#39;s going over 200 over the next three years. All of their divisions are hitting on all cylinders. Mid double digit growth. the cruise ships, the parks, streaming, 180 million subscribers. They added two and a half million subscribers. This is a high quality business with a durable mode. Well, and Jay, the concern as we were going into Disney&#39;s earnings was worries about the theme parks and that ended up being uh one of the positives along with of course who was going to replace uh Bob Iger and Disney Plus. Jay, why do you like",
      "Boeing at $130. Disney at $85. I don't need to think about these things. I don't need to stay up at night staring at the ceiling. Is Disney gonna stay in business? Okay. In the way it works in America is if you don't bring your children to Disneyland at least or world at least two or three times, child services comes to your house. They take your children and they take them away and they give them to new parents and they lock you up for being an abusive parent because you haven't taken your children to Disneyland.",
      "finally  had a nice constructive base and then a breakout above that 200 day moving average, a breakout of a long-term downtrend and then you put all the fundamental stories that the last guest just mentioned. And yeah, this is a recipe where if you want to get in this name, riskreward, there&#39;s much greater reward on the horizon than the risks. Now, we&#39;ll see what the secession line is, but uh something tells me Iger is going to do this one a little bit better than he did the last time he left Disney. and uh that shareholders that have been holding on are",

    "WMT": [
      "on the tariff front and I think Walmart is the bellweather that may be able to give us a little peak behind the curtain. They were the first company to really guide in January. They turned over in January before we peaked February 19th. Broke a long-term downtrend, held the 200 day moving average, coming back, but still not back to levels where it was trading before. Granted, it was up 100% over 12 months between December, December last year. Now, it&#39;s given back a little bit. Uh we&#39;ll see what that guide is. if they can tell us that inventory levels are fine, they&#39;re not concerned about tariffs, then uh we&#39;re a little more clear about what the future will be as far as the consumer goes. So, I&#39;m watching it closely and uh right now it&#39;s at an area where I&#39;ll wait to see how things shake out, but if it does sell off, I would buy it towards that 91 to 86 level uh for a long-term play and put it away. Yeah. No, I mean, and the concerns about your Walmart, your Target are fair enough. And also, Tom, we&#39;re going to get a big data dump in the morning. So, we&#39;re going to get retail sales. We&#39;re going to get initial jobless claims uh PPI that and then we also have uh Fed Chairman Jerome Pal uh speaking.",
      "We have this 90-day pause with China, which is good news for a company like Walmart. We&#39;re getting Walmart earnings tomorrow. That&#39;s going to be at 7:00 a.m. Eastern time. You say that that Walmart is going to be the barometer for the tariff trade because of how that they characterize they handle what has been the last quarter for them, which of course was concerns about their supply chain. Yeah, I think we&#39;re still a far way from certainty in this market. We&#39;re getting a little more certain, but uh there are a lot more",

    "UBER": [
      "Technically, it&#39;s blessed as well. So, I love it for a long-term play and put it away. We also showed our viewers while you were speaking, Jay, uh Uber, you like Uber, you say that this is a stock that&#39;s going to be 120 bucks by the end of the year.  Let&#39;s talk about the macro story because one of the things you say and I think this is so interesting. You say but the good news there&#39;s a lot of trapped bears out there. I like that terminology and what you say is that each new trade deal is as it&#39;s announced is forcing them to buy everybody that sold wrong. Yeah, you bet. Beginning of April record selling $1.1 trillion dollar of equity sold in the whole by hedge funds and CTAs. Every single new bit of positive news. Now they&#39;ve covered the shorts. Now they have to chase up. They did not believe this was going to take place. They&#39;re g every single headline. And by the way, earnings earnings growth was double what was expected. Even in the face of uncertainty, now that we have more certainty, guess what&#39;s going to happen? Upgrades. Upgrades to guidance. They&#39;re going to have to buy more and more and more. Like Donald Trump said, the market is going higher."

    "NVDA": [
      "lows. As a contrarian, as someone that follows these markets, that was the time to buy. Now, I&#39;m taking a little on the sidelines because this process, this V-shaped recovery probably will pause before we make new highs. Watch your favorite stock, Cheryl. Nvidia when they report on March on May 28th. I know we always talk about that every time I&#39;m on the show, but that will be a tell because we did see the Mag 7 stocks continue to spend. Their numbers should be good. They were good last quarter, but we were afraid of deepseat. Now we&#39;re afraid of tariffs and China relations. So, let&#39;s see how they do. If Nvidia can break out to new highs, and we still have 16 points to go, then uh the the bullish horns will be sprouting out of my head. Right now, I&#39;m kind of on the sidelines letting things digest. Well, I think these deals that President Trump has has been inking uh so far in the Middle East, and it&#39;s only day two of his his trip. Boy, I tell you, this is this is magic for Nvidia and and obviously a lot of those companies that are that are trailing him right now and following him around to these meetings, these these summits in particular with the Saudis. Uh Jay Woods, Tom Hayes, guys, thank you so much. Great to have you here for the top of the show.",
      "I got rich on Bitcoin, I'm so happy for you. That's great. It's outside of my lane. It's not what I do, okay? Uh I got rich on Nvidia. Congratulations. I'm so happy for you. It's outside of my lane. I just like these double, triple, quadruples. great businesses. I can sleep at night. Boeing at $130.",

In the way it works in America is if you don&#39;t bring your children to Disneyland at least or world at least two or three times, child services comes to your house.",
      "Love PayPal. Uh, we talked about it a few weeks ago. Go back to that article. Intel debuts AI GPUs for workstation system as it works to gain ground on Nvidia and AMD.\n### HEADLINES_AND_NEWS\nMoving along article of the week, Baba back in business",
      "wasn&#39;t a 10bagger. It wasn&#39;t Nvidia making 50 times your money. that was like you don&#39;t have to think hard about. Another one we did during the uh COVID was Wells Fargo. Wells Fargo three times in history it traded below 50% of tangible book. Okay, we built a huge position at $2510. And if the world was going to end, our view was that probably JP Morgan, probably Wells Fargo and and possibly Bank of America would be left standing. Okay. Uh, so JP Morgan didn&#39;t come come down enough that we felt like we were getting paid for the amount of risk we were taking. Wells Fargo came down enough that we&#39;re like, &quot;Yeah, this this is not going to be hard.&quot; And it went up to the high 50s very very quickly, got out at 57 and that that&#39;s that. But we didn&#39;t have to think hard about that because if Wells Fargo ceased to exist, you know, I like to say that the end of the world only comes once. Uh and if it&#39;s now, don&#39;t worry about your stocks. Uh and if uh if Wells Fargo cease to exist, that would be as as close to the end of the world as you could get. So that was a no-brainer. Yeah. Uh we hold stocks between 12 one year and five years, but I&#39;d say three years is kind of the average uh turnaround period. Yeah. Some go super fast like Monado was a quick double. That was one of the few that did it in less than a year and that was frustrating because we had to pay taxes, but it wasn&#39;t something that was a hold forever stock and we&#39;re like, you know what, take the win and move on. But usually it&#39;s going to take well more than 12 months. So, we&#39;re we&#39;re comfortable to like Cooper Standard, we started building at $5 and change in May of 2022. Uh that&#39;s now a five bagger off those, but we&#39;re three years in and we don&#39;t even think the story&#39;s begun. We think it&#39;s going to double again from here. So, that&#39;s going to take probably five years till we&#39;re fully out or, you know, getting out. But the return on capital is insane. So we&#39;re always looking at the tradeoff for internal rate of return has to be in excess of what we&#39;re measured against. Uh so if that time creeps too long and it starts to impact our IR that&#39;s something we we&#39;re cognizant of and by the same token if the IRRa is insane in a short period of time we have to harvest some of that. Um it&#39;s a balancing act. It&#39;s uh they were asking earlier what&#39;s going to happen to analysts with AI and I said you know the mediocre ones are going to be toast but that type of analysis like it can be done by machines but there&#39;s so much nuance. I remember when I worked at Cornwall and I&#39;d like I&#39;d sit down with them and I&#39;d pitch him on an idea and my pitch would be like I don&#39;t know five minutes and then the guy who was played by Brad Pitt in the movie he would start asking me",
      "So, you can see a lot of the um a lot of the obesity stocks got hit. You remember when Lily was so hot and I said, \"Ladies and gentlemen, there there's there's competitions coming.\" Just like I said with Nvidia, competition's coming. Um when they get that extreme and that certain Nova Nordis and everything else, they've just been slaughtered. Post election years tend to bottom in early April and rally. So here we are in the seasonality that bodess well all the way into late summer.",
      "Semiconductors. Okay. Yeah. Certainly last year and Nvidia peaked at uh June 20th. I remember because we wrote an article on June 20th. You can check hedge funips.com. And the thumbnail of the article was a picture of Jensen Wong signing a fan&#39;s brazier and I knew that was the short-term top. Uh I&#39;ve been to this movie a few times and the stock has actually not made new highs since that point. It may go on to make it but that&#39;s almost a year of dead money and it had quite a big draw down maybe 40% from that point at one at one point 35 40%. Okay. So, semiconductors, anything else people are super excited about? AI. Yeah, a lot of hype in AI. And I think all that stuff is going to come true. The question is on a company by company basis, are you already paying for the best case scenario if everything they say comes true is already going to be true? If you&#39;re paying a hundred times sales for a stock, you know, that&#39;s pretty amazing."

    "CBOE": [
      "We started it in the first quarter of this year.\n### MEDIA_APPEARANCE_RECAP\nWhen volatility ticks up you buy CBOE that&#39;s a no-brainer. Uh volatility huge crush in the last four weeks. Uh so their revenues are going to be a little bit lighter. Double downgrade it&#39;s a little aggressive. It&#39;s such a great business. It&#39;s got kind of a monopoly in the space. So, I think longterm it&#39;s okay. I think short short term I actually like the sellside call, which I don&#39;t say very often. Oh, interesting. Okay. Um, and then also we&#39;re looking at New Holdings. That&#39;s the holding company for New Bank. Um, and watching that stock. It&#39;s a Brazilian digital lender here. Um, and uh, it posted a slight miss in its adjusted profit for the first quarter. The company did see strong revenue growth of 40% year-over-year during the quarter, but higher spending on new clients dragged on its profit. The shares were down before. Now they&#39;ve turned higher by a little more than 1%. It&#39;s among the most valuable lenders in Latin America. Warren Buffett&#39;s Birkshire Hathaway is among its shareholders. That&#39;s usually Tom&#39;s mood music uh when he hears that kind of thing. Um we&#39;ve talked to the company before and it really has seen big growth. We also recently talked to Marcato Libre, another fintech and e-commerce company that&#39;s big in Latin America and the theme that they emphasize over and over again is just adoption. In other words, they&#39;re much, you know, they&#39;re not as far along as we are here in the US with everyone on devices, shopping, banking online, and so there&#39;s a lot of upside. Yeah. Well, uh, I got rich investing in South American banks is something no one&#39;s ever said. I I will say this, look, they&#39;re growing customers. They&#39;ve got a new technology. Buffett owns like a sliver. One of his underlings bought it. Uh, but as far as it goes, what you saw was their credit reserves went up in terms of uh expecting bad losses."

Every two years we&#39;re going to delist it. So we own it in Hong Kong. They&#39;re going to report earnings tomorrow. Okay, you saw JD. Earnings are going to be good. This is the cheapest way to own AI in the world because not only are their models beating Deep Seek and beating Open AI, but they&#39;re the largest cloud provider. And what they say to all these AI startups in China, every single one of them, we&#39;ll help you out. We&#39;ll give you a free sample.

It&#39;s coming to a theater near you. All right, Alibaba, we covered that. All right, I want you to understand this concept is critical. So, we talked about fundamentals versus price. Um, you can buy this stock effectively at 2014 prices. The difference today is that the revenue per share is up, 1100%. The cash flow per share is up 500%, the earnings per share are up 500%. And the stock is effectively flat. The one other stock I can think of that h experienced this type of improved fundamentals with no improvement in price until it all improved at once is Microsoft. Microsoft from 2006 to 2013 they grew revenues by 112%. They grew cash flow per share by almost 200%. And they grew earnings by 120%. The stock did nothing. In the following 10 years, it was up 1500%. And if you look at the fundamentals, everyone says, &quot;Well, Satia, Satia changed the world, blah blah blah.&quot; His improvement in revenue per share, cash flow per share, and earnings per share is not much better than Steve Balmer&#39;s was, except he got multiple expansion, and the stock went up 1500%. And and and that&#39;s what I talk about opinion follows trend. You&#39;re going to see the same thing with Alibaba. You&#39;re going to see the same thing with Cooper. You&#39;re already seeing with Cooper Standard is that when the price goes up a lot, everyone gets excited and they jump on the train. Okay? And the same thing is going to happen. What&#39;s what&#39;s dispondent now? Dispondency turns into euphoria. It&#39;s the extreme. Like Warren Buffett always taught from Ben Graham, the market is a manic depressive. Okay? It&#39;s it&#39;s one day the business is the same. In the short term it&#39;s a voting machine based on emotions. In the long term it&#39;s a weighing machine based on fundamentals. So that manic depressive if you can buy stocks from the market on its depressive days and sell stocks to the market on its euphoria days that&#39;s where you make your bones. Yes ma&#39;am. Yeah. Yeah. I I that&#39;s we tend to use that to enhance returns but you have to have a core underlying position as your core position because you can&#39;t be certain about the timing of your view even if it&#39;s a year or two years because look you could have done that in in Microsoft you&#39;re like wow they&#39;ve doubled their revenues they&#39;ve doubled their cash flow and you bought those options in 2014 by 2015 it hadn&#39;t moved and then from 2017 to 2020 you made 15 times your And the options would have been up 50 times. Yeah. But you would have gotten stopped out two or three times before that. That&#39;s why you start with the core position. So as the stock was slowly going up and your options kept expiring, you were making money and you could reload if you wanted to. But if you just do options, right, and you and you get the wrong year or two years, you&#39;re wiped out, right? So you do stock primarily and then add some excess for for some excess returns in the way that you position it based on option pricing volatility and that type of stuff. But your your thinking is correct. But just start with the stock. Don&#39;t try to get rich overnight. Buy the stock. I&#39;m going to own this thing until it reaches intrinsic value.

I feel like I&#39;m on a treasure hunt every day. Uh, again, Buffett, you don&#39;t need to be a rocket scientist. Investing is not a game where the guy with the 160 IQ beats the guy with the 130 IQ. In fact, it&#39;s often the opposite because the guy with the 160 IQ tends to be more emotional and uh affected by the day-to-day and trying to analyze every",
      "headlines about China and Alibaba. 135 weeks from one single journalist. Okay. Now, I won't say anything about this journalist, but I will say it would be the equivalent uh where this where this journalist was from would be the equivalent of having a Palestinian write articles about Israeli breakthrough tech companies. Okay, you're not going to get a positive article out of this one. And it was just going on and on and on. So, these were uninvestable for nearly four years, three years. And she wasn't the only one. uh every journalist and every sell side and everyone investor was negative on China. So let's take a look at perception versus reality. Okay, you know the story about the the the peak is when they canled the ant group IPO. Okay. And Xihinping, not Xihinping. Jackma Ma went into hiding became enemy number one because he spoke poorly about Xihinping. And we had the threats of dlisting the stock in the US. They had to go through the PCAOB report.

      "AI race, but we&#39;re going to keep your power on so you can run your AI queries through uh Alibaba&#39;s Quinn 2.4 large language model. Uh you can use open AI, too. But uh we&#39;re going to talk about uh a special international play in the breakout room. Uh what is that in 15 minutes, Mike? Yeah, you&#39;re okay. So, you&#39;re gonna like that. The theme of that room is called How the Uninvestable Became Investable. We&#39;re going to talk about some quote unquote currently uninvestable stocks and the actions we took in previous uninvestable stocks and what happened. Okay. Uh so GenerRack is a huge play on the home building. All I can tell you about this one and this is really what I do. I like to look at divergences between price and cash flow because the only reason you give $1 of your money into any business is you expect to get more than $1 back. So if they&#39;re not generating any cash, then your only hope is that another sucker comes behind you and pays more. And that&#39;s nothing more than a hope. And where you can really get hurt is if that hope comes true because as I said at the beginning of the presentation is the gamblers tend to give the money back to the casino. So when you get the high flyers right and you double your money quickly and you don&#39;t know how it happened oftentimes you wind up saying I&#39;m so smart and going into the next thing that you don&#39;t understand and uh and getting hurt. So with this you can see what&#39;s happened.",
      "The bottom line is Baba is firing on all cylinders and the beach ball hasn&#39;t even broken the surface yet. Here&#39;s everything you need to know about Q4 earnings. So, you can um go through that. Overall revenue was up 7% year-on-year. Income from operations 93%. Uh cash, let&#39;s go through the top. You can see section sector by sector up. AIDC international commerce up 22% cloud up 18% TAL team all up 9% um and then you can see the adjusted IBIDA and go through sector by sector so everything is hitting on all cylinders the 10 key points cloud segment se segment up 18% but even more impressive ibida was up 69% to 333 million management saw a surge in enterprise customer demand across different industries and more importantly ly they&#39;re now seeing a growing number of small and medium businesses demanding cloud and AI compute management continues to expect cloud segment to accelerate through fiscal year 2026 as they move forward with $52 billion of cloud and AI investment over the next three years. Two, Tableau and T-Mol posted another strong quarter with revenues up 9% to almost 14 billion rising 8% year-over-year. 88 VIP members, essentially the equivalent of Amazon Prime, remain the highest spending consumer group and continue to grow by double digits year-over-year, now exceeding 50 million users. Uh CMR revenues increased 12% in Q4 and are expected to remain strong, driven by the60% 60 basis point software service fee and the expanding use of Quanzan, a merchant advertising tool. The medium-term goal remains stabilizing market share for TTG which currently sits around 40% i.e. 40% of all e-commerce revenues in China go through Alibaba. Management returned 16.5 billion to shareholders in fiscal year 25 including 4.6 billion in dividends at $2 per ads and 11.9 billion in share buybacks which reduced the share count by 5.1%. So, what that means is your slice of the pie got 5.1% bigger without spending more money at today&#39;s price. That gives you a 1.62 dividend yield and a 5.1% buyback yield. Total shareholder yield of 6.72% before taking into account any share price appreciation, i.e. better than a quote unquote risk-free bond with no upside by 50% better. Management views instant commerce as a huge opportunity is starting to lean into it. The market is expected to grow from 500 to 600 million consumers all the way to a billion over time in China. Early results have far exceeded original expectations as management integrates instant commerce through TTG driving new users as well as increased stick stickiness frequency and overall consumption. These investments will weigh on IBIDA margins in the near term but will be a long-term growth driver for IBIDA&#39;s largest segment. For Baba&#39;s largest segment, AI related product revenue reached its seventh consecutive quarter of tripledigit year-over-year growth. Quen 3 series is now the largest open-source model family and continues to deliver worldleading performance on all key benchmarks at significantly lower cost. Stock-based compensation, which Ali used Alibaba used to hand out like candy, was just 473 million this year, down 52% year-over-year. Management has",
      "questions  because we ran over. Uh just to give you an idea, chat GPT is valued at $300 billion in its latest round. Uh that&#39;s the whole market cap of Alibaba. The difference is that Alibaba generated 17.8 billion in net income this year. Uh Open AI is lucky if they do 13 billion of revenues, never mind earnings. Okay, so that&#39;s OpenAI is an example of euphoria. Uh, Alibaba right now is an example still of dispondency. Sell euphoria by dispondency. It&#39;s a good formula. China&#39;s the number one AI global AI play. The most AI you can get for the least amount of money. Their large language models have been proven competitive and better than deepseeek and open AI on many accounts. And for compute, they give all the pretty much every AI startup in China goes through Alibaba, number one cloud player. They say, &quot;We need compute power.&quot; Alibaba says, &quot;No problem. We give it to you for free like every good drug dealer. Give you a free sample.&quot; And then they say, &quot;Just give us equity.&quot; And they have free equity in all the AI startups in China. So it&#39;s almost like an AI ETF by owning Alibaba. Cloud revenue up 18% plus. So all of them are hitting on on uh every cylinders. we like a lot about. You got the e-commerce, you got the uh the cloud compute, you&#39;ve got the AI play, you have uh Tao and T- mall a play on the government initiative to get that $20 trillion of savings circulating. Alibaba is the toll taker. Uh middle class recovery play and for the first time ever, mainland Chinese stocks could buy Alibaba through the stock connect. So, imagine if you&#39;re getting three Amazon boxes at your door for the last 10 years, but the US government said you couldn&#39;t own Alib uh couldn&#39;t own Amazon and all of a sudden they said, you know, that company you&#39;re sending all your money to and they send you boxes. Uh you can own some equity in that company. And that&#39;s exactly what happened. Analyst analysts estimate 20 billion dollars in potential inflows from new buyers. I think we&#39;re at uh already eight billion or something like that just in the last six months. Something like that. So, the game&#39;s just beginning. You&#39;re getting another source of buyers until the foreign buyers start to step in on top of it. Um, by the way, owning China as a pension manager and a large asset manager was like owning energy in 2020. Now, if you if you didn&#39;t own an energy in the last year or so, you underperformed. So, they all all owned energy. So, they sell the bottom, they buy the top. Opinion follows trend. tariff exposure. Less than 1% of Alibaba&#39;s 134 billion in revenue came from the US, so it&#39;s a non-issue. Uh, the D-listing would only hurt Americans. And this is how you contact me.

      "Moving along  article of the week, Baba back in business\n\n--- OVERLAP CONTINUED ---\n\nstock market and sentiment results . So we went through the media. Now on to the Bank of America fund manager survey. Five key points. US equity allocation is at the lowest since May 2023 with a net 38% underweight. So maybe a little short-term bounce but back to intermediate term the trend will continue international over US. Number two managers are the most underweight the US dollar since May 2020 May 2006 with 17% of investors holding a net underweight position. Counter trend bounce, get the Johnny come lately, resume the downtrend like you saw in the first part of the century from 2000 to 2007. Global energy, nobody wants to touch energy with managers at a record low net 35% underweight to the sector. Expectations for a soft landing rebounded 61% up from just 37% in last month&#39;s survey. and five recession expectations appear to have peaked even before the US China tariff agreement was announced only 1% of May FMS investors now see a global recession likely down from 42% in April Alibaba update uh what you can see here they said they were going to invest in cash flow but look what&#39;s happening with revenues uh revenues keep going up margins are going back up return on invested capital is going up cash flow down because they&#39;re investing to be number to stay number one and to win the AI race which is the cheapest global AI play with the most possible upside. You want them to invest when they&#39;re just buying back stock. They&#39;re saying we cannot get a return on invested capital greater than 10%. When they start investing in the business they&#39;re telling you we can out earn doing buybacks because the opportunity set is grand. And that&#39;s exactly what we&#39;re seeing.

So china&#39;s rapid economic expansion has been driven by increased manufacturing and production while we&#39;re relying on an investment growth model. consumption makes up 55% of GDP in China compared to 70% in wealthier nations. US households consume 12 times the nominal dollar amount of their Chinese counterparts. China&#39;s made boosting domestic consumption a top economic priority in the last 12 months, aiming for 70% by 2035. To put it in perspective, China&#39;s 2024 GDP was $18 trillion with consumption at 55%, which is 10.3 trillion if they grow 5% this year and then slow to 3%",

Yeah. Stopped out in terms of what the risk I&#39;m willing to take. Um All right. So this shows revenues cash flow and these are type of things I like to look at. This is just a page from value line and you can see over time what&#39;s happening to the revenues per share, what&#39;s happening to the cash flow per share, what&#39;s happening to the earnings per share. And what&#39;s interesting is if you actually look at that for good businesses that line tends to be like in a bad period it&#39;ll be flat. In a in normal periods, it goes like this and then stock price goes like this around the actual fundamentals of the business. And what we try to do is we try to buy when price is here, but fundamentals are still here. And we try to sell when price is here and everyone&#39;s excited and there&#39;s headlines  and uh people who hated it down here are on stage in the main room loving it up here. You you&#39;ll probably have some people pitching Baba next year at $200. I&#39;ll be if we have a if we have a presentation, if we have a a money show, I would definitely say 18 months from now, there&#39;s going to be a speaker on stage pitching Baba over $200. It will not be me. I&#39;ll be waiting for him to get it over 250 and I will be helping out his audience get as many shares as they like. So, write that down. Put it in your Google calendar. It&#39;s coming to a theater near you. All right, Alibaba, we covered that. All right, I want you to understand this concept is critical. So, we talked about fundamentals versus price. Um, you can buy this stock effectively at 2014 prices. The difference today is that the revenue per share is up, 1100%. The cash flow per share is up 500%, the earnings per share are up 500%.

If you&#39;re going to build houses, what do you need? Tools. They own DeWalt. They own Craftsman. They own Stanley. This one got crushed by COVID over inventoried, inflation, etc. What I can tell you is they&#39;ve taken out the last two years almost $2 billion of business uh of cost.$2 two billion dollars of costs, which equates to about uh it&#39;s about $13 per share on $154 million shares just on the cost savings as they normalize margins.

      "Generrack is a huge play on the home building. All I can tell you about this one and this is really what I do. I like to look at divergences between price and cash flow because the only reason you give $1 of your money into any business is you expect to get more than $1 back. So if they&#39;re not generating any cash, then your only hope is that another sucker comes behind you and pays more. And that&#39;s nothing more than a hope. And where you can really get hurt is if that hope comes true because as I said at the beginning of the presentation is the gamblers tend to give the money back to the casino. So when you get the high flyers right and you double your money quickly and you don&#39;t know how it happened oftentimes you wind up saying I&#39;m so smart and going into the next thing that you don&#39;t understand and uh and getting hurt. So with this you can see what&#39;s happened. You can see why the price dropped 80%. You see those red bars on the top? That&#39;s negative free cash flow. People were worried about solveny risk. Look what&#39;s happened since they&#39;ve cut cost, increased margin, and the cycles come back. Free cash flow&#39;s gone up. And what hasn&#39;t gone up yet that&#39;s starting to inflect is price. And if you can find businesses where there&#39;s a divergence between either a price has gone up too high and cash flow is negative, that could be a short or price hasn&#39;t gone back up but cash flow has recovered. When they turn, it turns all at once and you make many multiples very very quickly. Uh this is going to be a triple over the next few years. This is another leverage play on the housing recovery inherent demand. So, uh, three super boring plays with super exciting outcomes if you have the patience and you sit tight and watch this play out over the next few years. So,\n### ASK_ME_ANYTHING_QA\nwith that said , I think we&#39;ve got it all. That&#39;s how you can reach me and we&#39;ll take one question or two. Yeah. Building. Yeah, I love it.

Uh I haven&#39;t looked at the underlying fundamentals and and price and all that stuff, but I think anything in that sector, I like the way you&#39;re thinking. Absolutely. Yeah. And by the way, and and the other thing I would think about these type of stocks, when you have a stock like Gener that&#39;s down 75%. Okay. Um, if it goes $5 against you tomorrow, just log in, look at the free cash flow and say, \"Ah, in the short term, the market is a voting machine based on emotion. That&#39;s where you get $5 moves.\" And you say, \"Am I wrong? What does everyone else know?\" Nothing. It could be a hedge fund blowing up. It could be a short attack. It could be nothing. Just look at the underlying business. Like if you were going to buy a jersey Mike&#39;s down the street and the guy said, \"How much do you want for your business?\" you say, \"Well, why don&#39;t you show me your books first, and if you&#39;re profitable, I&#39;ll make you an offer.\" You know, people do that in normal business.

Anyone familiar with VF Corp? They&#39;ve been around since 189 something 93 95 125 years. What they have a DNA for doing is buying and selling brands. Okay. So right now the brands in their stable are Northbased, Timberland, Vans, okay, a company called Vans. And Vans has gotten hit extremely hard because they oversupplied during COVID. It was super popular. Everyone bought three pairs of Vans, very similar to Nike with the Air Force Ones. Uh, and then and the Air Jordans. And then it went through three years of decline. They brought in a new CEO. His name is Bracken Daryl. And the thing you need to know about Bracken Daryl, and I&#39;m trying to emphasize this point about management. Bracken Daryl has a background at Proctor and Gamble, at Old Spice. He&#39;s a brand manager. He&#39;s exceptional at it. He came into a little company called Logitech. Okay. And this is the cancer curing products that they made at Logitech. Okay. Complete commodity product. Nothing revolutionary about a mouse or a webcam. He came in when the stock was down 82% just like he came in at BF Corp with the stock down 82%. Uh in the next 10 years it was a 28 bagger. A million dollars became $28 million selling this that you could get anywhere. Why is that a Logitech? Okay. Because he understood branding. He understood operations. He understood supply chain management. He&#39;s a winner. You want to bet on the jockey. So you may say, \"Oh, Vans will never come back.\" Bracken will bring it back. He&#39;s he&#39;s worked through the channels. Now he&#39;s going to ramp it up. He&#39;s going to start bringing in the creators and the the influencers and the the whole marketing plan. You&#39;re going to see massive action. Northace is a recovery on China. It&#39;s doing well. Timberlin the same thing. So this is the type of bet. So when you&#39;re buying a stock down and what did he do? He sold off Supreme for over a billion dollars to pay down debt to delever the balance sheet. Why? To get multi-year runway to run the turnaround plan and not get stopped out in the meantime. So that&#39;s the type of things that we like to look at. So near-term catalyst, etc. Um, the key with these is the temperament."

      "okay. So, that was Exxon, and we didn&#39;t get the the exact bottom. I think the bottom was $25. Um, we got it 33 blended, and we didn&#39;t get the top. Uh, I think we sold it below 100. It&#39;s now 105. But, you know, it wasn&#39;t a 10bagger. It wasn&#39;t Nvidia making 50 times your money. that was like you don&#39;t have to think hard about. Another one we did during the uh COVID was Wells Fargo. Wells Fargo three times in history it traded below 50% of tangible book. Okay, we built a huge position at $2510. And if the world was going to end, our view was that probably JP Morgan, probably Wells Fargo and and possibly Bank of America would be left standing. Okay. Uh, so JP Morgan didn&#39;t come come down enough that we felt like we were getting paid for the amount of risk we were taking. Wells Fargo came down enough that we&#39;re like, &quot;Yeah, this this is not going to be hard.&quot; And it went up to the high 50s very very quickly, got out at 57 and that that&#39;s that. But we didn&#39;t have to think hard about that because if Wells Fargo ceased to exist, you know, I like to say that the end of the world only comes once. Uh and if it&#39;s now, don&#39;t worry about your stocks. Uh and if uh if Wells Fargo cease to exist, that would be as as close to the end of the world as you could get. So that was a no-brainer. Yeah. Uh we hold stocks between 12 one year and five years, but I&#39;d say three years is kind of the average uh turnaround period. Yeah. Some go super fast like Monado was a quick double. That was one of the few that did it in less than a year and that was frustrating because we had to pay taxes, but it wasn&#39;t something that was a hold forever stock and we&#39;re like, you know what, take the win and move on. But usually it&#39;s going to take well more than 12 months. So, we&#39;re we&#39;re comfortable to like Cooper Standard, we started building at $5 and change in May of 2022. Uh that&#39;s now a five bagger off those, but we&#39;re three years in and we don&#39;t even think the story&#39;s begun. We think it&#39;s going to double again from here. So, that&#39;s going to take probably five years till we&#39;re fully out or, you know, getting out. But the return on capital is insane. So we&#39;re always looking at the tradeoff for internal rate of return has to be in excess of what we&#39;re measured against. Uh so if that time creeps too long and it starts to impact our IR that&#39;s something we we&#39;re cognizant of and by the same token if the IRRa is insane in a short period of time we have to harvest some of that. Um it&#39;s a balancing act. It&#39;s uh they were asking earlier what&#39;s going to happen to analysts with AI and I said you know the mediocre ones are going to be toast but that type of analysis like it can be done by machines but there&#39;s so much nuance. I remember when I worked at Cornwall and I&#39;d like I&#39;d sit down with them and I&#39;d pitch him on an idea and my pitch would be like I don&#39;t know five minutes and then the guy who was played by Brad Pitt in the movie he would start asking me",
      "transition. Let&#39;s buy Exxon Mobile at $33 a share. Paying a dividend. World is shut down. Not a complicated decision because if Exxon goes, I have a lot more to worry about than my stock portfolio because if we&#39;re not pumping energy and we&#39;re not keeping the lights on and uh people have stopped moving, you know, last thing I&#39;m going to be worried about is my stock portfolio. So, yeah. That&#39;s a good question. I don&#39;t Six or seven. You remember in the 40s? Yeah. Six or seven in the You bought it in the 40s. Yeah. So, it must have been eight. So, there was a real risk they were going to cut the dividend and I fully accepted that. I mean, any stock that drops that much. I&#39;m not buying for the dividend. I&#39;m buying for the turnaround. Every now and then, they keep the dividend. Like, uh, we didn&#39;t have time to talk uh Jeff had noted 4.4% 4% dividend yield on Stanley Black &amp; Decker right now and the stock is down 80% 80%. So might they cut it? Yeah. But the fact that they&#39;ve taken almost $2 billion of cost out of the business and the revenues are starting to reacelerate. You probably get that lock it in. They keep growing the dividend over time. They&#39;ve cut it a little bit. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So um Yeah. So what was it at peak, right? Like 8% or something. Yeah. When the stock had dropped. So that happens in those situations. But once the business stabilize, what do they start doing? Increasing the dividend again. So on your basis, it starts to really compound. I mean, Buffett gets annual dividends close to the total amount of basis he invested in Coca-Cola in 1989. It&#39;s unreal. And it keeps growing every single year with ah adjusted. It&#39;s It&#39;s complicated, but cheaper than now. Um, okay. So, that was Exxon, and we didn&#39;t get the the exact bottom. I think the bottom was $25.

You&#39;re going to stick around and find out. I mean, if you&#39;re holding the stock and you&#39;re like, &quot;Well, I&#39;ll bet they didn&#39;t commit fraud and the DOJ is just going on a fishing expedition.&quot; It&#39;s like, &quot;That&#39;s kind of gambling.&quot; You know, I had clients ask me because I like to buy stocks. I was like, &quot;Under $200 a share? I might be willing to assume that gambling risk, but uh not yet.&quot; that could be a quick recovery. Uh but that goes in my two too hard box like I how can I have an edge? So the point I&#39;m making in that context is that&#39;s why you know our highest conviction idea is not 100% of the portfolio. Now we&#39;re concentrated 8 10 12 stocks uh but we accept the risk that any one of those stock so when I size positions here&#39;s another filter besides owning the entire business is if this position went to zero would they take me out on a stretcher and if the answer is yes the sizing is too large and I&#39;m I&#39;m being a cowboy so I&#39;ll never take that risk if The answer is no. The other nine positions in the portfolio are all going to be doubles and triples. If this goes to zero, it doesn&#39;t matter. I&#39;ll still outperform. Then the answer is yes. You&#39;re sizing it correctly. And you have to go into that assumption in every single investment that there could be things that you don&#39;t know that you don&#39;t know. UNH is a monstrous business. This is not some shy, you know, insurance agent on the corner selling away some policy that they shouldn&#39;t have sold. This is like serious stuff and you have to have that assumption. So if everyone is crowding into one stock and you&#39;re like, &quot;Oh, if I just buy you that stock,&quot; that&#39;s how you really get hurt. So you even no matter how good your research is, no matter how high your conviction, no matter how high the margin of safety is in the business, there can always be a risk that you don&#39;t know that you don&#39;t know. And there&#39;s no way you could possibly know. No matter how good you&#39;re you are as an analyst, it&#39;s just a black swan. think they&#39;re in the Dow. Sorry. Might get kicked out. Uh I don&#39;t know. But if they did get kicked out, it would take a while. And those stocks have a tendency to outperform in the next 12 months.

But the ones that double and triple the fact that it got to the point that it can have that type of expected value in a short period of time tells me that&#39;s not a hold forever.

      "price is effectively flat. The one other stock I can think of that h experienced this type of improved fundamentals with no improvement in price until it all improved at once is Microsoft. Microsoft from 2006 to 2013 they grew revenues by 112%. They grew cash flow per share by almost 200%. And they grew earnings by 120%. The stock did nothing. In the following 10 years, it was up 1500%. And if you look at the fundamentals, everyone says, &quot;Well, Satia, Satia changed the world, blah blah blah.&quot; His improvement in revenue per share, cash flow per share, and earnings per share is not much better than Steve Balmer&#39;s was, except he got multiple expansion, and the stock went up 1500%. And and and that&#39;s what I talk about opinion follows trend. You&#39;re going to see the same thing with Alibaba. You&#39;re going to see the same thing with Cooper. You&#39;re already seeing with Cooper Standard is that when the price goes up a lot, everyone gets excited and they jump on the train. Okay? And the same thing is going to happen. What&#39;s what&#39;s dispondent now? Dispondency turns into euphoria. It&#39;s the extreme. Like Warren Buffett always taught from Ben Graham, the market is a manic depressive. Okay? It&#39;s it&#39;s one day the business is the same. In the short term it&#39;s a voting machine based on emotions. In the long term it&#39;s a weighing machine based on fundamentals. So that manic depressive if you can buy stocks from the market on its depressive days and sell stocks to the market on its euphoria days that&#39;s where you make your bones. Yes ma&#39;am. Yeah. Yeah. I I that&#39;s we tend to use that to enhance returns but you have to have a core underlying position as your core position because you can&#39;t be certain about the timing of your view even if it&#39;s a year or two years because look you could have done that in in Microsoft you&#39;re like wow they&#39;ve doubled their revenues they&#39;ve doubled their cash flow and you bought those options in 2014 by 2015 it hadn&#39;t moved and then from 2017 to 2020 you made 15 times your And the options would have been up 50 times. Yeah. But you would have gotten stopped out two or three times before that. That&#39;s why you start with the core position. So as the stock was slowly going up and your options kept expiring, you were making money and you could reload if you wanted to. But if you just do options, right, and you and you get the wrong year or two years, you&#39;re wiped out, right? So you do stock primarily and then add some excess for for some excess returns in the way that you position it based on option pricing volatility and that type of stuff. But your your thinking is correct. But just start with the stock. Don&#39;t try to get rich overnight. Buy the stock. I&#39;m going to own this thing until it reaches intrinsic value.

He&#39;s really good at applying technology to get cost synergies.

So they don&#39;t put it in. So they could they what we call sandbag. They very conservative on the guidance. Um you know we look we started building that thing. We had a basis below 100. It shot up to 194. It&#39;s come down to 124. It&#39;s not changed our view on the stock. It&#39;s just how it recovers. Thing had a heart attack. You know when you have a heart attack you get off the table. You don&#39;t run a marathon. You go out. You walk around with the pole. You let go of the pole. You think you&#39;re okay. You fall on the floor. or they&#39;re like go back to the poll for a little while. I mean 80% down is a heart attack. Okay. So now they&#39;re walking again with the pole and they&#39;re going to try again and then they&#39;re going to do better. And this happens. It is a very cyclical business because uh in in some of our video cast we&#39;ve gone through the cycles where they have the revenue declines and the cash flow declines and then it starts to reacelerate. But if you look at that slide I did in the last presentation cash flow is nearing record highs and the price the stock price is still down some 80%. This is a uh this is like, you know, Buffett talks about the fat pitch. Wait for the fat pitch. For me, this is a complete no-brainer. Yeah. So, they&#39;ve bought back uh we had we skipped through the slide, but they&#39;ve got 20 billion more on their buyback. They they&#39;ve been buying in tons and tons of stocks for the last few years. They started paying a dividend. They just announced a special dividend. Uh so, we&#39;re not in it for the dividend. It&#39;s nice to see them returning capital. They&#39;re going to continue. They the interesting thing difference between US managers and Chinese managers. The Chinese to their credit were buying every share they could get their hands on below 100 in the hole. Whereas US managers after the stocks up 10x they start b announcing big back by big buybacks so that there&#39;s liquidity for them to sell their own options. And it&#39;s a completely different mindset. So the Chinese buy low and sell high. the uh American managers for the most part when the stock collapses they&#39;re not in the market buying. So we&#39;re happy that they&#39;re doing it and uh their buyback rate is slowing in the 120s which I&#39;m very happy to see. I love that they were buying handover fist in the in the 80s and 70s and they they still have uh 20 billion of author authorization and they will use that but um the time to buy for the for the company because they&#39;re stewards of my capital as an owner um was to be buying when when we were buying and uh and and you know I I don&#39;t think we&#39;re going to get material dips from here for them to buy in a huge part of the company.

And then you really want to know the properties. I mean, in Verernado's case, I knew all the properties in New York and they were the highest. So, you get a 7% yield, it's probably okay.
