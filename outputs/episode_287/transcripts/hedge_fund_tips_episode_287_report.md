**Tom's Current Market Conviction: Constructive to buy stocks at these levels. → 8/10** 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥☆☆

- Market corrections are man-made and can end with a tweet.
- Analogies to Trump 1.0 trade war and European debt crisis suggest a bottom is near.
- Retail investors have been right buying the dip, while hedge funds have been selling.

## Macro Thesis & Key Data Points
The market is currently experiencing a correction due to tariff uncertainties, but this presents an opportunity to buy high-quality businesses at discounted prices. Historical patterns suggest a recovery is likely, with potential for significant upside once a resolution is reached on trade deals. China's shift towards domestic consumption and potential stimulus measures further support a constructive outlook.
