  "cleaned_transcript": "I think we&#39;re there or close. There&#39;s a saying, Stu, out of crisis comes opportunity. If you look at Trump 1.0 trade war in 2018, the market fell 20% into December. Four months later, it was at new highs. If you think this is going to take a little longer, we look at the European debt crisis in 2011. Market fell 20%. Eight months later, the market was at new highs. But I think you&#39;re there. Maybe you go back and retest. I heard my buddy Kenny Pulkari earlier on the show. That&#39;s certainly a possibility. But, uh, this is the time when you want to be buying high quality businesses for the long term and keep your head, keep your cool. Easier said than done. You got two stocks that you particularly like. Let&#39;s start with Boeing. Why do you like them? Well, uh, in the context on focusing what you on what you can control and buying good assets when they&#39;re marked down, you&#39;ve got one of the best businesses in the world. A duopoly with a half a trillion dollar backlog with a new CEO, Kelly Ortberg, is turning turning the ship around just like you did at Rockwell Collins. Uh, 10-year backlog. This is a great business duopoly and not going to be as impacted by tariffs simply because if you want a plane, you can go to them or you can go to Airbus and that&#39;s about it. How about Disney? That&#39;s been badly beaten down. You It&#39;s in a dip. You buying the dip? There&#39;s no question about it. If you can own Boeing under 160 for the long term, if you can own Disney under 90 for the long term, the parks are, you know, decades and decades of emote. the experiences, the cruise ships, high return on invested capital, and their streaming has shown resiliency, growth, and stability. So, we like this business for the long term, and we love it under 80. Well, it&#39;s at 85. No, you mean you love it under 90? Under 90, under 80? You know, look, Stu, if you look back in two years, whether you bought it at $100, whether you bought it at $90, whether you bought it at $85, you&#39;re going to look back and pat yourself on the back. This is going to be a lot higher. Well, that would be nice. Okay, Tom, thanks for joining us. The bell is ringing. That means the trading begins in about 10 seconds. And we&#39;re back then.\n### MEDIA_APPEARANCE_RECAP\n\n\nIf you can own Boeing under 160 for the long term, if you can own Disney under 90 for the long term, the parks are, you know, decades and decades of emote. the experiences, the cruise ships, high return on invested capital, and their streaming has shown resiliency, growth, and stability. So, we like this business for the long term, and we love it under 80. Well, it's at 85. No, you mean you love it under 90? Under 90, under 80? You know, look, Stu, if you look back in two years, whether you bought it at $100, whether you bought it at $90, whether you bought it at $85, you're going to look back and pat yourself on the back. This is going to be a lot higher.\n### MEDIA_APPEARANCE_RECAP\nI had the pleasure to join Mattie Mills on Monday morning. Uh, want to thank Mattie Mills, Justinifer, just excuse me, Matty Mills, Justin Oliver, Cheyenne Reed for having me on for the full hour. Stephen did a good job cutting 60 minutes into 15 minutes so you can get all the key spots.\n\nquestions , and of course asking questions  to some of our guests. Tom, great to have you in. for having me. Happy to be here. So, we were just talking about how you do a great job of getting\n\nquestions  to some of our guests. Tom, great to have you in. for having me. Happy to be here. So, we were just talking about how you do a great job of getting\n\n--- OVERLAP CONTINUED ---\n\nquestions  in from your audience on your podcast and answering some of those\n\n### ASK_ME_ANYTHING_QA\nWell, I think people are a little bit concerned about the uncertainty of the tariffs. How long is this correction going to last? How when when are the lows in? And I I think this time it&#39;s a little bit different than people worried about the great financial crisis. People worried about the tech wreck. Is this going to continue to cascade? This is man-made. This is not a function of multi-year buildups like you saw in the late &#39;s with the tech tech exuberance. It&#39;s not a function of excess in the housing market like you saw with the great financial crisis. Uh this started with a tweet. It could end with a tweet. Uh one one day you could wake up and and you see this beautiful tweet that says, &quot;I just got off the phone with Xihinping and the market rallies.&quot; Uh two analoges I&#39;m looking at, Maddie. First and foremost was Trump 1.0 trade war. We had a 20% correction in uh 2018. It took four months to recover to new highs. And then if we get a little more volatility with all the negotiating, we go back to 2011 and look at the European debt crisis. We have some debt rumblings here with US treasuries. That took 3 months and it was extremely volatile uh volatile. However, once you you nearly touch that 20%, the bottom was in. So, we&#39;re pretty sanguin and pretty constructive to buy stocks at these levels.\n### FEATURED_COMPANY_DEEP_DIVES\nAnd are you suggesting buying stocks kind of across the board or are there certain areas investors should look at more than others? Well, I think it&#39;s it&#39;s what you want to get in terms of return. So, we look for some of the beaten down sectors because we want to get excess return over time. Uh, one of the groups that we&#39;re looking at is homebuilders. Believe it or not, you can&#39;t give them away right now, but we like a gentleman named Brad Jacobs. He wrote a book, How to Make a Few Billion. And it&#39;s it&#39;s useful because he actually made a few billion. And he&#39;s put 1 billion of his own money in his new project called QXO. This is a building supply rollup play. Uh if you had invested with him in the past, whether it was United Rentals, if you put a million dollars in when he got involved in 1997, you made $79 million to date. If you got involved with XPO Logistics when he got involved, he put 150 million in in 2009, you would have made something like $160 million, 160x. So, uh, we want to bet with him because the trends are there. You know, as a millennial, everyone&#39;s looking to buy houses. They&#39;re waiting because rates are high and there&#39;s not enough supply. T\n\n### MEDIA_APPEARANCE_RECAP\nUh one one day you could wake up and and you see this beautiful tweet that says, &quot;I just got off the phone with Xihinping and the market rallies.&quot; Uh two analoges I&#39;m looking at, Maddie. First and foremost was Trump 1.0 trade war. We had a 20% correction in uh 2018. It took four months to recover to new highs. And then if we get a little more volatility with all the negotiating, we go back to 2011 and look at the European debt crisis. We have some debt rumblings here with US treasuries.

If you got involved with XPO Logistics when he got involved, he put 150 million in in 2009, you would have made something like $160 million, 160x.\n\na 4 million unit shortage and as we know, Trump is going to open up federal land. So, not only do you get your starter home from KB Homes, you get an endangered elk in your backyard free of charge. Uh but the the fact of the matter is supply is coming online. He&#39;s going to benefit. And he started off with a company called Beacon Roofing. Everyone needs a roof. When your roof is leaking, it&#39;s a nondiscretionary expense. You don&#39;t think about should we plug the roof? We we replace the roof immediately. Yeah. He bought it at 10 times Ebida. He kind of paid up, but he&#39;s going to add technology as he always does and double Ebida over the next few years. And I know another name that you&#39;re looking at CRK, I believe. Yeah. Comtock Resources. Well, guess what? Not only do we have negotiations with China, we had negotiations with Europe. And what do we want to sell Europe? We want to sell Europe our LNG. And Commtock Resources is controlled by Jerry Jones, who also owns the Dallas Cowboys. He&#39;s an oil and gas legend. He owns 70% of the stock. We got involved around $9. It&#39;s doubled. However, if you look at proven reserves of this company, uh they&#39;re worth about what enterprise value is now. But the real value, the real unleash is unproved reserves. They&#39;ve got over 15 years of drilling that&#39;s not recognized on their financials because they&#39;re only required to report PV10. So we think from these levels over the next 24 months, this stock can not only, you know, it&#39;s already doubled since we started talking about, we believe it can double one more time uh over the next 12 to 24 months. So we love the LG play. We know Europe is going to start taking a lot more of our gases in exchange for tariff mitigation and it&#39;ll be a very good thing. All right, two stock picks for you from our guest host, Tom Hayes. Tom, you&#39;re going to stick with us for the hour. Appreciate it. Thank you so much. Well, President Trump&#39;s tariff policies got a little more confusing over the weekend, leaving investors once again uncertain about the market outlook. Our next guest has sectors that are currently offering safety and also has ones to avoid. We are joined here by Eric Bay. He is Sound Income Strategies co-chief investment officer. Eric, great to speak with you. I I absolutely agree with you on the material side. Absolutely bombed out. We&#39;re looking uh we we kind of share an affinity here. I can tell you have a value tilt to you. We&#39;re looking at Albamaro, for instance. They got $3 billion of excess liquidity. Are there any uh materials names that you&#39;re looking at, Eric? Well, we we own a bunch of them. One that I really like that a lot of people don&#39;t because of uh they&#39;re afraid the dividend will be cut is Dowo Chemical, one of the best companies in the world. Unfortunately, they they have had their and Lionell a similar company also in plastics have seen their demand come down a bit. Um but I think over a long period of time those are two companies that you definitely want to own. They&#39;re both high yielding stocks and they have substantial capacity for rebound both in their margins, volumes and earnings both of course cash flows. Eric I got to know about ADT. This thing has been a value trap forever. Uh you know before it went private now since it&#39;s it&#39;s gone public again. Give me the growth story. Why is this thing going to come out of this range? Why is this not going to be a value trap? I want to believe. I want to believe. Talk to me, Eric. Sounds very easy to sell ADT now because they sold their commercial business. They deleveraged the balance sheet and their earnings are growing now. Thank you so much. We got to leave it there. Thank you. Coming up, we&#39;re going to take a closer look at some of today&#39;s big stock movers, including an incoming lipmus test for luxury retail. That&#39;s next. The upside. Thomas, we were just talking about some of the regulatory pressure on LVMH, but when it comes to their exposure to China, at least to the Chinese consumer, they could be a beneficiary. Yeah, there&#39;s no question about it. The Chinese government has explicitly stated they&#39;re going in all in on massive consumption stimulus for the Chinese population to offset any impact from the Trump tariffs. So, LVMH is going to be a major beneficiary of that. If I look at my credit card bill every month, 10% is probably Sephora from my 10 and 12 year old girls. They they spend all their free time at Sephora. So LVMH uh I I think you have to start to look at these companies that benefit from Chinese consumption because uh I think the government you know we&#39;ve waited for this China recovery for two plus years and I think they&#39;ve held back this stimulus because they were anticipating the possibility of of tariff friction and this would be a way for them to offset it and to continue to grow. uh you know Alibaba will be a major beneficiary from massive consumption and the Chinese government has explicitly stated uh we want to get our people to 70 our economy to 70% consumption within 10 years that is a huge stretch so companies like this have a long secular tailwind we&#39;ll have short-term volatility and bumpiness but on red days and there&#39;s going to be opportunity to buy really great companies and we should mention just for the audience it&#39;s really interesting to see China kind of do a U-turn on stimulus because the government has been very anti stimulus obviously didn&#39;t offer it during COVID and now we&#39;re hearing them come out and offer this stimulus potentially off the back of these tariffs. So certainly a U-turn from the government there. But let&#39;s go next to TMC. It is a metals company and rare earth minor MP MP materials also rising after a report that President Trump is planning a stockpile order. The Financial Times says Trump is drafting an executive order to stockpile deep sea critical metals in an effort to counter China as the US seeks to become self-sufficient with these assets. So, let me give you a little bit more context here. China saying that they are no longer going to be able to export some of these rare earth minerals. That is just the latest retaliatory move from China when it comes to the trade war. And then you have President Trump firing back to the degree that he can, saying, &quot;Okay, well, we will just start stockpiling what we have available.&quot; Um, but as you know, Tom, obviously these are really critical minerals. They go in the likes of motors and cars, obviously chips for phones as well. So, it&#39;s something that we we do need and it&#39;s something that the administration is focused on. Yeah, there&#39;s no question President Trump believes he holds the cards, but China has one major card here. When you look at a company like TMC, it&#39;s an $800 million company. So, like how much can you stockpile based on their current production? I think this is going to help us get to a sensible place with tariffs, a reasonable agreement where we get more than we had. Uh, China gets less than they had. We kind of bridge that surplus. And I think embedded in this what we&#39;re going to find ultimately it&#39;s going to come down to a reval of the currency relationship. Chinese taking the yuan up further to kind of bal balance that imbalance. Uh and uh and and we won&#39;t have to put such pressure on tiny companies like TMC to stockpile rare rare minerals that China has in abundance. Yeah, certainly a smaller company when it comes to the ones that we talk about here. But let&#39;s end with a bigger firm. Sony announcing price hikes for its PlayStation 5 console across Europe, the UK, Australia, and New Zealand. The company citing the quote challenging economic environment, including high inflation and fluctuating exchange rates. BS5 Digital Edition will now cost nearly $570 in Europe and the UK, an increase of 11% and 10% respectively. And there you can see the shares moving to the upside alongside the broader market by about 2%. Is this just the beginning of price hikes that we&#39;re going to start seeing more broadly across the globe? Well, it&#39;s it must be an amazing franchise to have that pricing power and to say we are raising prices on on our PlayStation because it&#39;s a challenging environment. In other words, we don&#39;t want to do it, but you need our product so much that even though you&#39;re challenged, we&#39;re going to raise the price and we&#39;re going to do just fine. So, you may see some of that uh across the board. We&#39;ll know more in coming weeks and months as this thing gets resolved country by country. You had Hassid on uh uh earlier this morning talking about maybe some package deals, getting a bunch of countries done at once. You start getting that stuff hit the tape and this this bottom in the markets could be durable. Let&#39;s see how it comes in coming days and coming weeks. Let&#39;s certainly see it is fascinating. I&#39;ve spoken with sources before who&#39;ve told me that these consoles, these video game players, they there&#39;s not like an off-brand version. So, they do have a lot of that pricing power. To your point, Tom, you&#39;re going to stick with us for the second half hour of our show. And by the way, you can scan the QR code to track the best and worst performing stocks with Yahoo Finance&#39;s trending tickers page. So, I have a question for Andrew. Uh, what do you see CEOs doing? What&#39;s their strategy? Are they saying we&#39;ll just wait it out and eat it for three and a half years? Are they going to stand up factories in the US? And then what what happens if policy changes three and a half years from now? There&#39;s a lot of confusion. How how do you play that? And do the big get bigger as the smaller players just go out of business or h how are you thinking about it? How are CEOs thinking about it from large companies to small companies? So there&#39;s still a lot of uncertainty. Marco, when do you think we&#39;re going to see the pivot from the uncertainty of tariffs to the opportunity for growth with tax cuts, deregulation? In other words, package this up like Kevin Hasset was talking about this morning. Maybe packages of countries all at once. put the pain behind us and now focus on growth, deregulation, tax cuts, etc. When do you think when do you anticipate seeing that pivot? It&#39;s very hard to tell, right? I I I don&#39;t think, as I said, I don&#39;t I don&#39;t expect uncertainty to dramatically decrease in a very short time. I think uncertainty is here to stay. Are you shifting your allocation to XUS or you haven&#39;t made that decision as a as a firm yet? We haven&#39;t made this decision yet. I will not like talk about specific portfolio allocation here, but is t\n\n### MISCELLANEOUS\nthat stuff hit the tape and this this bottom in the markets could be durable.

I will not like talk about specific portfolio allocation here, but is there is\n\n### MEDIA_APPEARANCE_RECAP\ncoming into earnings, are you comfortable with the valuation 37 times forward? You got a $400 billion enterprise value on 7 billion of free cash flow. You know, that kind of compares to Disney, for instance. They&#39;ve got 8.5 billion of free cash flow and maybe 190 billion enterprise value. Oh, and by the way, you get the parks and you get the experiences and you get the cruise ships for free. um just talk about what that means in terms of exceeding expectations and now that they&#39;re not reporting subscribers and you&#39;ve seen Disney kind of stall at 178 million subscribers and Netflix maybe stall at 300 million subscribers. Uh what are your thoughts on the relative value? I mean it&#39;ll be interesting to see how the fundamentals actually shake out and what we what kind of commentary we actually get from senior management. They&#39;re going to guide the market. they&#39;re going to give us that strategic conviction in terms of whether we believe the Bulls or the Bears. Like whose assumptions do we go with? And in terms of Disney, we can&#39;t forget that they have a substantial amount of their business in the Far East. So they are also exposed. And you know, I think net net it&#39;ll be interesting to see who&#39;s the bumper in this.\n\nfocus on what you can control when the markets marked down like this. What if you focus on buying highquality companies that are marked down? One of the companies we were buying last week aggressively was uh Disney at $85. You don&#39;t have to think hard about Disney. It&#39;s down from $200. Over the next few years, it&#39;s going to recover. Tariffs or no tariffs, it&#39;s going to be okay. Boeing was a company we were adding to. it got down to1 $129 down from $350 some odd dollars. This is a duopoly in in in the aircraft space. So if you buy great companies and you and you have a long-term view 12 to 24 months, you&#39;re going to do great out of this opportunity. To that end, Nvidia was under $100 a couple weeks ago as well. So certainly something to keep in mind.\n\n### QUOTES_OF_THE_WEEK\nI learned early on in the business, good things happen to people who buy highquality companies at low prices. And that&#39;s all you can do right now. On every red day, you look for an opportunity to buy great businesses. You know, last week, Boeing got down to $130 a share. Disney got down to $85 a share. These are down more than 50% from their peaks. These are things you can go to bed, wake up, not even having to worry about. You got two new ideas, Sarxo. I don&#39;t think a lot of folks are familiar with this one. This is Brad Jacobs new rollup. It&#39;s a building supply company. This guy knows how to make money for shareholders. If you had invested $1 million with him and when he did URI, you made $74 million to date. If you had done the same exact thing with QXO in 2009, you made $160 million. So, we&#39;ve got 4 million units housing shortage in the US. Donald Trump has said, &quot;We&#39;re opening up federal lands. Not only do you get your starter home from KB Homes, you get an endangered elk in the backyard free of charge.&quot; They are going to be supplying. They just did beacon roofing supply. They paid 10 times Ibida. He&#39;s going to double that IBIDA with with technology, with tuck in acquisitions. This is one you buy, you tuck away for five to 10 years, and you&#39;re gonna wind up with an eight to10 bagger. And comtock. Comtock we gave on your show January of 2024 around $9. It&#39;s now up double. We think it can double again. Why? Part of the negotiations with the EU are going to be about we&#39;ll lower your tariffs. You&#39;re going to take all of our LNG. Uh Jerry Jones owns 70% of this stock. The unproved reserves are worth another $20 a share. We like this here.\n\n### FEATURED_COMPANY_DEEP_DIVES\nThey just did beacon roofing supply.

They need our planes more more than we need their sales. That&#39;s for sure. I think look in the kingdom of the blind, the oneeyed man is king, okay? The countries that come to the table first and sign the deals first are going to have certainty.\n\nBut I I just want to say about the Chinese rejecting Boeing aircraft is like a diabetic rejecting insulin. They need our planes more more than we need their sales. That's for sure. I think look in the kingdom of the blind, the oneeyed man is king, okay? The countries that come to the table first and sign the deals first are going to have certainty. T\n\nan enormous premium on certainty for your economy. That&#39;s on the one side. On the other side, Kevin has it was on the network saying, &quot;We&#39;ve got bundles of deals.&quot; Well, the administration needs to take yes for an answer because the minute we take yes for an answer, it shows that we&#39;re ready to do business. We don&#39;t need to have self-inflicted pain. What we need is some certainty with the deals so we can get focused on earnings, growth, and tax cuts. Yeah. If we if we get tax cuts and we get some certainty on tariffs, if we do, you got a market that goes straight up, do we? That&#39;s right. You know what? The market is a discounting mechanism. The minute we see those bundles of deals come across the tape, companies can start to give guidance. Once companies can give guidance, we have some level of certainty and there are a lot of tremendous bargains in the market right now. Money is going to want to go to work as we get a little bit more certainty. All right, Tom, thanks very much for analyzing the market this morning. We appreciate it. Thanks for having me. \n### MEDIA_APPEARANCE_RECAP\nSo we had a lot of volatility last week. This feels like a little bit more normaly now or at least trying to kind of figure out how do we get back to normal. Um you pointed out that this is the first correction where seasoned pros seem more fearful than retail investors. Um I&#39;m surprised to hear that. But how did you arrive at that assessment? Yeah, well incoming phone calls. I mean, I have peers in the business that were calling me in literally abject fear and me kind of walking them off the ledge and saying, &quot;This too shall pass.&quot; You know, if you look at the data, uh, retail investors have actually been buying in the hole on this correction and hedge funds have had record selling in the hole. And what&#39;s interesting about that, most people say, &quot;Well, the dumb money smart money.&quot; Let me tell you something. The retail investors have been right since co they have been buying weakness while professionals have been selling weakness and the retail investors have been correct and I think this is going to be the case again. But was some of that fear warranted? I&#39;m not saying one should feed into fear but like when we saw that volatility last week obviously we&#39;ve cooled since then on volatility when we look at the VIX it&#39;s not at those historic levels that we saw. Um, but you know, when you&#39;re in this daily, you&#39;ve experienced that turbulence before, it does kind of trigger it triggers a a memory that wasn&#39;t great. That&#39;s right. That&#39;s right. Look, the the administration has to learn to take yes for an answer. Okay. They have deals on the table or as Kevin Hasset would say bundles of deals on the table and all they need what you need to see is one credible deal roll across the tape and then the market will realize there&#39;s some rationality in the administration. They&#39;re going to move ahead. Things are going to be okay. Uh we&#39;re just in the period of uncertainty and the way that you get through that is you focus on what you can control and all you can control is buying high quality businesses when they&#39;re on sale. I learned very early in the business, good things happen to people who buy highquality assets when they&#39;re marked down. And you know, irrespective of how long it takes to get a deal, if it takes So here&#39;s two two analoges. Trump 1.0 in 2018, trade war market corrected 20%. It recovered Vshape within 4 months to new highs. Could that happen? That&#39;s a possibility. We&#39;re slightly more in the camp. It&#39;s going to be like the 2011 European debt cris where you had a 20% correction and then three months of hell non-stop volatility and then 8 months later you were at new highs. Really quickly, I know you&#39;ve got a couple of uh picks, but I want to ask you that point about volatility. Although we&#39;re not at that level that we saw last week, which reminded people included of the uh GFC. Um, is volatility here to stay or at least during this presidential term? Yeah. Uh, well, the the history of President Trump is volatility followed by upside resolution. And that&#39;s his formula. He knows how to push it to the edge and then break through and the market resolves higher. So, I think you just have to on a company by company basis buy quality that you don&#39;t have to worry about, not speculative stocks. and we&#39;re going to find we wake up one morning and he says, &quot;I just spoke to my good friend Xihinping and the market&#39;s up 5,000 points.&quot; He does call his good friend. I mean, it&#39;s an interesting characterization there. But, okay, let&#39;s talk about your picks. Um, especially given your views on how you want to buy things, where you see opportunity, potential sale. CRK is on your list. Comtock Resources. Now, you picked this a year ago or a little more than a year ago, right? It&#39;s been a winner since then, up more than 100%. Um, why are you still bullish? Where do you see it going? I think part of the tariff negotiations is particularly with Europe is going to be you want a reduction in tariffs. You need to take all of our LNG. Okay. They need our LG. We have it in abundance. They need to take it. And they&#39;re going to want to do that deal. Uh, Comtock Resources, 70% owned by Jerry Jones, who owns the Cowboys. uh the proved reserves that they report to the SEC which is 10 years of drilling are worth about uh $8 billion. The enterprise value is around $8 billion. However, their unproved reserves which they do not report uh is another 15 years of drilling. Okay. So, we think that&#39;s worth um about $10 billion which means we think not only it doubled since we talked about it, we think it can double one more time over the next 12 to 24 months. Is there still a push for LG given the Trump administration&#39;s uh not the same focus on converting to more um I&#39;m finding I&#39;m trying to find the word how you care I mean it&#39;s considered a better better for the environment. Uh that&#39;s a good question. You mean he&#39;d prefer coal? Well you look you can&#39;t make it up. Well, I think he wants everything and we&#39;re going to need everything to power the data centers, to power the increased demand, whether it&#39;s EVs, whether it&#39;s data centers, uh, unlimited demand and globally unlimited demand. So, that&#39;s a great way to play it. Okay, your next ticker, QXO. Now, look, that&#39;s a different pick than this in terms of its performance. Uh, I mean, with Comtock Resources, that&#39;s outperformed the S&amp;P 500 uh this day. But QXO, this seems like a little bit of a Where does it go? Yeah, this is a relatively new position for us. This is Brad Jacobs. Brad Jacobs is a winner. He makes money for shareholders. If you had invested a million bucks with him when he started United Rentals in 1997 when he got involved, you&#39;re up 70 some odd, 74x, $74 million. If you did XPO logistics in 2009, he came in, he put 150 million bucks of his own money, bought stock, you&#39;re up 160%, 1 million became 160 million. Now he&#39;s doing a roll up. Same formula, different industry in building products. You got 75 million millennials, 34. They want to buy houses. They can&#39;t afford them. So Besson&#39;s going to deregulate banks, bring down Treasury yields below uh 4%. Okay? Hopefully the good way. Not through not through a recession, but the good way. Uh that will make housing affordable. And Trump is opening, you know, we got 500 million acres of federal land. He&#39;s opening that up to build all these starter homes. So KB Homes will build your starter home. You get an endangered elk free of charge in your backyard. And Brad Jacobs is going to provide all of the building supplies. He&#39;s going to do a rollup. He&#39;s going to add technology. He started with Beacon Roofing Supply. When your roof is leaking, it&#39;s a non-discretionary expense. You don&#39;t think about should we buy a new roof? You have to buy a new roof. I mean, you could patch it, but yeah. Yeah. So, the history of Brad Jacobs is you put money in, you don&#39;t think about it for 5 to 10 years. And this will be 5, six, seven bagger. Uh, at the least, and if history is any prologue, it&#39;ll be a lot more than that. Okay. Potentially a 10 bagger, I think. So, I&#39;d always bet on Brad Jacobs. He is serious. He wrote a book, How to Make a Few Billion. That&#39;s pretty useful because he actually made a few billion dollars. All right. And last, but certainly not least, I really enjoyed this interview with Kristen Scher on NYSE Live. Want to thank Kristen, obviously, and Mel Montana. No relation to Tony Montana from Scarface whatsoever. Mel is fantastic. Mel and uh Kristen are the dream team. We&#39;ll listen in here. Welcome back to NYC TV Live, everyone. I&#39;m Christine Scherer here in studio. Well, stocks are looking at a negative open after what was a muted action yesterday and of course two straight days of gains for the S&amp;P before that. Well, joining me now with more on where we&#39;re headed from here and how investors should respond to all of this is Thomas Hayes. He&#39;s a chair and managing member at Great Hill Capital. Uh Thomas, always great to have you. Great to be here, Kristen. All right, so what do you make of all this market action of late? Uh you want the good news or the bad news? Let&#39;s start with the good news. Okay. Okay. Well, the good news is the same as the bad news, and that&#39;s everyone is pessimistic. Okay. So, you saw the fund manager survey from Bank of America this week. Uh, highest expectations of a recession, fourth highest uh in 20 years. So, we&#39;re talking about 2022, we&#39;re talking about 2020, we&#39;re talking about 2009. Uh, most number of managers wanting to go underweight US equities. So, usually that&#39;s a wash out. And what we&#39;re seeing is the quote unquote dumb money is now the new smart money. Retail investors have been buying a ton of stock on this weakness. Hedge funds have been recordelling in the hole and oddly enough retail investors have been right since co. So let&#39;s talk about what these tariffs mean for companies and and how companies might respond to them. Of course we&#39;re at the beginning of earning season. Thomas, what&#39;s your expectation especially when it comes to guidance? That&#39;s the big deal. I mean the big problem is companies can&#39;t guide in this period of uncertainty and uh Kevin Hasset was was on one of the networks yesterday uh or two days ago now saying we have bundles of deals with amazing terms. Well my message to the administration is how about taking yes for an answer. Uh you saw Vietnam come to the table and they said we&#39;ll do zero tariffs if you do zero tariffs. I understand there&#39;s uh non-tariff barriers, but what the answer should have been was we accept in principle contingent upon working out the non-tariff barriers. Instead, they did not. And what happened? China went to visit Vietnam and they just inked a deal. So, you snooze, you lose. I think the administration has a lot of good things going. They should book one deal and that&#39;s going to give companies more certainty to say, &quot;Hey, here are our three guidance scenarios. If they continue to do deals, good things are going to happen. And if they don&#39;t, medium things are going to happen. And if they really don&#39;t, here are the bad things that could happen. And then the market can kind of get their hands around it. But right now, we&#39;re just shooting in the wind. So we are probably down still about, let&#39;s say, 14% roughly on the S&amp;P 500 from a recent high. Do you think it is rangebound until we get a little bit more certainty? Yeah, we have two frameworks. One would be Trump tariff war 1.0. In 2018, you had a 20% correction. Yes. And then you were at new highs four months later. That&#39;s a possibility. We would love that. Uh the second scenario that we&#39;re looking at is the 2011 European debt crisis. 20% correction and then 3 months of hell, choppy volatility. Even though the bottom was kind of in marginal new lows, it was literally up and down every day for three months of uncertainty until Mario Draghy came out and said, &quot;We&#39;ll do whatever it takes.&quot; So, we need one of those moments. So either way, but even in that case, eight months later, we were at new highs. So I learned early in the business, Kristen, good things happen to people who buy highquality businesses when they&#39;re marked down. And I think this time will be no different. What are some of the high quality names, Thomas, that are on your radar? Yeah, I think number one, don&#39;t give up on PayPal. Everyone is down on PayPal. It&#39;s kind of round trip. It shot up to 90. Everyone&#39;s like, &quot;Woo, we&#39;re up 50%.&quot; Now it&#39;s back down in the 60s. They&#39;re generating recordfree cash flow. 7.5 billion. They&#39;ll probably do 7.5 8 billion. They&#39;re going to buy back 20% of the company in the next 2 years. Alex Chris came from into it. He ran 50% of the revenues. He had a 30 bagger while he was uh running the small business division there. He&#39;s going to do the same things for PayPal. PayPal&#39;s down because EU said, &quot;Oh, you&#39;re going to tariff us. We&#39;re going to tariff your processors.&quot; And people shoot first, ask\n### FEATURED_COMPANY_DEEP_DIVES\n\n### MEDIA_APPEARANCE_RECAP\nwe&#39;re just shooting in the wind.

PayPal&#39;s down because EU said, &quot;Oh, you&#39;re going to tariff us. We&#39;re going to tariff your processors.&quot; And people shoot first, ask questions  later. The fact of the matter is the deal is going to be very simple with the EU. You take our LNG, we&#39;ll lower your tariffs. They won&#39;t tariff our processors. All will be well. Alex Chris is going to run this up up the flag pole. You see Will Ferrell on the TV commercials. They&#39;re rocking and rolling. They&#39;ve got 430 million active users. This is a huge business. Every time you take an Uber, that&#39;s actually PayPal. You don&#39;t even know it. It&#39;s called Brainree. Interesting. Yeah. Uh another energy company I know has been on your radar for a while as well. What&#39;s the latest on that? Yeah. So, Comtock Resources, uh it&#39;s it&#39;s a double since we started talking about it. Uh that&#39;s over a year ago. We think it can double again. And here&#39;s why. 8 billion enterprise value. The proved reserves PV10 that they have to report to the SEC 10 years of drilling is worth about 78 billion. So that&#39;s good. Um there the unproved reserves which they don&#39;t have to report is about 15 years of drilling. We estimate that&#39;s worth about $10 billion. Uh so we think it can double one more time from here. And it&#39;s perfectly in line with the Trump administration initiatives of drill baby drill, massive energy, powering the data centers, and now of course servicing Europe. Yeah. I do want to ask Thomas the lessons from 2018. I think there are real\n\n### FEATURED_COMPANY_DEEP_DIVES\nThey won't tariff our processors. All will be well. Alex Chris is going to run this up up the flag pole. You see Will Ferrell on the TV commercials. They're rocking and rolling. They've got 430 million active users. This is a huge business. Every time you take an Uber, that's actually PayPal. You don't even know it. It's called Brainree.\n\n### FEATURED_COMPANY_DEEP_DIVES\nSo, Comtock Resources, uh it's it's a double since we started talking about it. Uh that's over a year ago. We think it can double again. And here's why. 8 billion enterprise value. The proved reserves PV10 that they have to report to the SEC 10 years of drilling is worth about 78 billion. So that's good. Um there the unproved reserves which they don't have to report is about 15 years of drilling. We estimate that's worth about $10 billion. Uh so we think it can double one more time from here. And it's perfectly in line with the Trump administration initiatives of drill baby drill, massive energy, powering the data centers, and now of course servicing Europe. Yeah. I do want to ask Thomas the lessons from 2018. I think there are real\n\n### ASK_ME_ANYTHING_QA\n\nthe lessons of Trump 1.0 and and 2018 are uh excess volatility followed by resolution to the upside. That&#39;s the way he rolls. So, he throws out these grenades and everyone ducks for cover and then when he realizes there&#39;s enough pain, he goes in and he fixes the problem. And I think what you&#39;re going to see is as you see one, two, three tape bombs, look, you&#39;re going to wake up one morning, everyone&#39;s pessimistic, and you&#39;re going to see a beautiful truth or tweet, whatever he wants to call it, it&#39;s going to say, &quot;I just got off the phone with my good friend Xihinping, and the market&#39;s up 5,000 points, and you&#39;re you&#39;re stuck, you know, in cash, and you say, &quot;I missed it.&quot; So, I think it&#39;s selective buying. It&#39;s not wholesale buying. It could take longer than we expect. Deal with the volatility as it relates to supply chains. We just need to see one deal hit the tape and then they can get a little more comfort. There&#39;s some rationality. We can slowly move ahead, but yes, people are slightly on pause and that will have an impact in economic numbers in the first couple of quarters for sure. \n### MISCELLANEOUS\nAnd if that&#39;s the case and they do announce something like that, in my view, that would probably be the top for gold. Obviously, the bottom in the market. Um, so just something to consider. Not really something you can act on because it&#39;s not done, okay? And nothing gets done until one man says it gets done, apparently. So, um, but it would make sense why they wouldn&#39;t at least announce one or two deals, um, when they&#39;ve got so many countries coming together. And if that is the case, that is a great thing. I&#39;d be a little surprised if it was as soon as this weekend. It seems like an awful lot to get done in a short period of time, but I&#39;d be open to it, let me tell you that. And uh and for all the clients that are in, by the way, congratulations to everyone who came in. Congratulations to all the new clients. We we named a bunch of them last week, all the existing clients who put money in in when it was down the most last uh Tuesday and Monday after we did our special private client call. Um and uh and new clients that came in over the transom uh in time for our closing on Saturday. So, super job and uh that&#39;s kind of the good news. You can probably leave it there and go watch football games now and uh color Easter eggs for your kids. But uh let&#39;s let&#39;s go back to the S&amp;P 500 because again, when fundamentals are thrown out the window, you have to look a little bit at technicals. And um let&#39;s take a look. If you recall, we talked about a quote unquote double bottom. I had to walk my friend off the ledge the other week. Um and uh and quite a few others, by the way. Uh but that&#39;s okay. You know, that&#39;s that&#39;s what bottoms look like. And uh even the best have have reason to get scared because it&#39;s man-made. You can&#39;t handicap it. It&#39;s not years of build up and then you can say, &quot;Oh, okay. It&#39;ll take, you know, 24 months and we&#39;ll be back at new highs.&quot; So, when it&#39;s man-made, a tweet creates it. A tweet can solve it. And or an accord or a grand package overnight. And if you&#39;re caught flatfooted in cash or whatever, you just you can never get it back because you wake up and it&#39;s too late. So, um, so this double bottom is still holding. I think last week we were kind of here and everyone was despondent. Then we started to rise. People got a little happier. Yesterday, pulled back, but in the scheme of things, didn&#39;t really pull that much. This is still holding for now. Everyone is looking for the retest. Maybe we get it, maybe we don&#39;t. If we get that if we get that package over the weekend again, probably a coin flip, maybe a little more than a coin flip, then we&#39;re there&#39;s no way we&#39;re going back here. If we don&#39;t get it, uh, that wouldn&#39;t surprise me. And it could be the 2011 scenario we discussed, three months of hell, chop, most of the pain&#39;s in, but you just like just wait killing time for three months until they get their act together. Um, or if we get this weekend, it could blow at 2018 back at new highs within 4 months, which would be unbelievably exciting. Uh, so I&#39;m just trying to throw this perspective out. Uh, literally, by the way, off the plane late last night, super early out here in California. So, if I sound like I&#39;m on a lot of caffeine, um, you&#39;re perceptive. Let&#39;s just leave it at that. Put call Trin by the way taking the girls and Caitlyn and I are taking the girls to Hawaii on Friday tomorrow for a week. So we&#39;ll do it how I like to. I&#39;m going to play a lot of incredible courses. Uh half day work, half day play. Girls have been wanting to go to Hawaii forever. And apparently on the West Coast, Hawaii is the Caribbean. Uh as we relate to it on the east coast, I guess Cabo and and Hawaii are the Caribbean like we have on the east coast. So very excited to show them that. Haven&#39;t been there. Caitlyn and I were there before we got married. So my goodness, 17 18 years ago. That&#39;s uh time flies. Uh certainly when you&#39;re having fun and uh give Caitlyn credit that uh we we have had a lot of fun together and uh we&#39;ll we&#39;ll have another week of great memories with the kids. All right, skew. Uh that&#39;s down. This is you know these are when skew is washed out you know that these are the times when you need to worry when skews elevated and and we were noting that I you know this this this was this was likely okay and we talked about that buckle up buttercup February March blah blah blah this 10% move was likely this overshoot has been unlikely, but I think it&#39;s going to get resolved relatively quickly, like 2018. So, uh, we were kind of fine to ride or die. This this was unnecessary, to be honest. But all things considered, it&#39;s like sending Xi the Christmas card, even though he doesn&#39;t celebrate Christmas, is is going to be sending Trump because we put literally record amounts of money to work last week. Even more than we put to to work in October 2022. And I said last week, if you&#39;re on the fence, you need to come in because, you know, number one, I&#39;ve never asked anyone to invest. I&#39;ve always just put out value and and good people find me after they see the framework, make some some money with my ideas or their referrals from existing clients. Um, but there were two times in my career that I told people, now&#39;s the time if you&#39;re on the fence, either put more money to work or to come in fresh. One was October 2022 and uh one was last week uh and and in this range right now. So, um so there&#39;s that. Let&#39;s see how it plays out. Uh I know how it plays out the long term. How does it play out in the next few days or few weeks or few months? Uh we covered the different scenarios last week. You can see some great companies on sale. You know, Chevron getting knocked down. That&#39;s probably getting interesting. Nike, same story. Disney, um Intel, you know, all this stuff. Once you get an announcement, the whole framework of investor thinking is going to change and it&#39;s going to change super super fast. Um, so just enjoy the buy 1 get one free sales and one day you wake up, I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s Monday or five Mondays from now or 12 Mondays from now, but um, you know, the Intel&#39;s I mean this is these are the environments that I absolutely live for. Okay. So, want to thank we I think I&#39;ve got the\n\nYou can see some great companies on sale. You know, Chevron getting knocked down. That&#39;s probably getting interesting. Nike, same story. Disney, um Intel, you know, all this stuff. Once you get an announcement, the whole framework of investor thinking is going to change and it&#39;s going to change super super fast. ### MISCELLANEOUS\nSo, want to thank we I think I&#39;ve got the\n\nput somewhere else. So, that we'll get to that in a minute. Um, thanks Steve for just sending this over. This is Albamaro and we've covered the overlay of um lithium prices to Albamaro in the past. They got 3.5 billion of excess liquidity to ride or die. Um, and this is the when Albamaro's dividend yield gets around 3%, the stock price tends to bottom. And that's exactly where we are right now. And my response to Steve was we don't own enough. And, you know, at some point you have position limits. You know, there's we we own enough, but you never own enough once it starts turning, you know, and that that's just the way it works. Uh, so thanks Steve D on that. Yurian Timmer been at Fidelity for 40 some odd years. He had an interesting tweet. Easy to forget just how many 20% draw downs we've had just in the last five years. We had a 28% decline in 2022, 35% in 2020, 30 uh 20% in 2018. In other words, every two years the market suffers a large draw down and it has come back every time, sometimes quickly and sometimes slowly. So that's just putting things in perspective. returns after 15% draw downs from Rit Holtz. Um, one year later, uh, 83% positivity rate up 15%, three years up 40, 5 years up 66, 10 years up 158, 185. Uh, this isn't fun, but it happens from Carson Research. Number of corrections in bare markets since World War II, 25 of 10 to 20% what we just had. Seven of 20 to 30, three of 30 to 40, and three of 40% or worse. Foreigners selling US equity funds selling in the hole just like they did during COVID. Really not a good time to sell. China's March lending jumped on government stimulus push. That is going to be the unintended positive consequence. We're going to cover all the D-listing in detail today. Okay, we covered some of it in the article, so just chillax. Um, energy positioning getting to levels where we continue to want to look for more. We're we're very happy with our comm stock as you can tell. Uh, but there will be other things to do. Historical morning start equity research coverage price to fair value estimates at uh month end. So they're trading at price to fair value uh levels that you really only see uh at big drawd downs and and and usually they inflect from these levels. So Morning Star does a really good job on their fair value estimates because they're Buffett accolts. It's a Midwest firm. They're always there. The founder is friends with Buffett, friends with my first boss who was friends with Buffett for 40 years. So I know all these guys. They do really good work. And um okay, now we got uh US exceptionalism theme, a long way to unwind. Um yeah, and this has been kind of coming into the year. We said XUS, this is going to converge. You're going to see outperformance, not doesn't mean US is crashing at all. It just means underperformance. Why? Because of mag 7. All the themes that we covered in the fourth quarter that got you ready to be out of Mag Sev before the first quarter have played out. International was crushing it uh to on a relative basis. Some 60 point spread is probably still not far from that um outperformance and that will come back after any type of package is announced. Expectations for dollar depreciation highest since March May 2006. This was another theme. Dollar would continue to weaken. That is playing out. Soon as package is announced, EM will rebound back quickly. Options traders bet on rally to 120. That is on the euro relative to the dollar. There you go, ladies and gentlemen. Uh Chinese exports up ahead of US tariff hit. By the way, for all the new people, we have a ton of new people. you know, my longtime fans and uh and um awesome partners here uh know all these things that I said three months ago, six months ago, etc. You can go back to the archives and pull up any date and see what we were saying and uh kind of how it played out uh at your leisure. Chinese exports up ahead of US tariff hit. So, a lot of pull forward that's going to help uh obviously helped with US car sales as well. help help with uh uh Baba's earnings I'm sure in the first quarter. So we we'll see how that works out. 42% say gold is best performing asset in 2025. That's part of the reason I think that if they announce a grand package and a currency deval gold is sniffing that out and uh once it's actually announced by the rumor sell the news uh watch out below. Record number of fund manager surveys intending to cut US equities. That's what they always do in the hole at the exact wrong time. Uh record two-month rotation out of US stocks. That's probably a theme that will persist. Relative value of XUS FMS cash surges to 4.8 selling in the whole record by re record by hedge funds. Retail have been buying retail have been right since 2020. Uh COVID S&P liquidity has deteriorated recently. That is another indication that I think what you're going to have to see is the Fed will go back in. They may not cut uh right away, but they are going to go back into quantitative easing and call it something else. Um uh to keep the liquidity going unless a deal is announced, the liquidity will come back naturally. Co total net call volume, they couldn't get enough in January. They couldn't uh you couldn't give them away in April. Well, what does that tell you? Historically, last time was uh Q4 2022 when you couldn't give them away. That was the best time to buy them. So, I don't know what else to tell you, ladies and gentlemen. I mean, this stuff is not rocket science. Even though value stocks, valuations remain, okay, even though value stocks have outperformed year to date, valuations remain significantly attractive. That was one of our other themes. The final theme is going to be small caps. That hasn't worked yet. It is going to work in spades just like the dollar took a little longer. Watch out above, not below. Uh volatility spikes have been opportunities that by the way that requires a package that requires tariff mitigation. That requires all that. But I think it's coming and uh you know for a guy who wants to be on Mount Rushmore, if he can pull this thing off, um it will be unreal. No one's been able to do it post World War II. Uh so you know who knows uh we'll leave it at that. Volatility spikes have been opportunities. Uh S&P average forward price return 1990 to April 2025. Forward periods from when VIX level triggered. And that is uh from periods when VIX weekly closed above 45. And you can see that one year out you're up 34.2%. two years out, which point of this chart is we just had that uh two years out, you're up 51%, three years out, 50, five years out, 112, six years, uh 10 years out, 220%. So hang tight, ladies and gentlemen. Um inflation expectations, highest since June 2021. Okay. net expecting higher shortterm rates. Fascinating. This has a tendency to be right and this has a tendency to be at or near peak inflation for the short term. So that's fascinating. Global model new model launches. Oh, for cars. Oh, lot of lot of new cars. A lot of exciting cars coming out. That's good to see. Uh foreign central bank, which means they're going to flood the lot soon. They've taken down inventories huge by the way in the last few weeks ahead of the tariffs. This is going to be such a great thing because all you see is incentives. So now the aptal purchase price has come down because of all the incentives and because everyone trying to get ahead of tariffs once they do a package um the incentives are going to be expected and the volumes are going to have to replenish the thing. So hang in there on Cooper Standard. I know some of you are getting uh uh your panties in and not but uh chillax. We're going to be okay. Uh foreign central bank smart money record outflow foreign demand for US stocks.

So again uh just like they sold in the hole at COVID they&#39;re doing the exact same thing.\n\n### HEADLINES_AND_NEWS\n\n### TECHNICAL_CHARTS\n\n### ASK_ME_ANYTHING_QA\n\none of the most volatile weeks in history. uh you see the average true range uh and uh these levels fiveday average uh tend to coincide with major bottoms. Uh Trump Nvidia commits to invest $500 billion uh and then he kind of stuck the knife in their back the next day. That&#39;s uh it&#39;s just the environment we&#39;re in. VIX. Can we go wrong buying the S&P 500 with VIX greater than 50? No. We just looked at the data. Great financial crisis COVID. That&#39;s the time to be a buyer, not a seller. I don&#39;t think it&#39;s a wholesale buyer. I think it&#39;s a select bespoke buyer, but a buyer nonetheless. US exceptional theme has peaked. We agree. Not because US isn&#39;t the greatest place in the world. I think it&#39;s just going to be a reversion from seven stocks to 500 stocks. And the 500 stocks represent regular Americans, middle, lower middle class, uh, wage earners, uh, doing a lot better than the investor class who have been jammed into these seven mag seven stocks that just got their asses handed to them. Um, uh, and have no international exposure to offset that. um they&#39;re going to be the ones that are going to do less well and the ones that uh are diversified exus international and you know small cap value all the themes we&#39;ve covered as well as uh regular Americans and that&#39;s when the country hums is when everyone participates not just a few at the top uh charts of the month FMS investor sentiment sinks to five fifth lowest level on record. We covered that in our article. We&#39;ll do that in detail. MAG 7 valuations are at their lowest level since January 2023 pending new earnings guidance. I think the guidance might come down a little bit more. So, this might not be an accurate number yet, but I&#39;m not going to lie. You know, I keep looking at Amazon and even Invidia when it got under 100. Um, time will tell. not doing anything there yet because there&#39;s so many better opportunities. It&#39;s like all those you can buy and if we&#39;re right and we trade back to the top of the range maybe you make you know 30 40 50%. But I&#39;m not really willing to commit any type of capital uh ever unless it&#39;s at least a double if not a triple plus um even if I have to play the time arbitrage game and it plays it takes a few years I just don&#39;t take risk for 30 to 50%. It&#39;s just not not what I do. uh valuations of all major indices are now below their 10-year averages. Uh that&#39;s fascinating with small cap having the largest divergence of 24% below its uh discount below its 10-year average on the forward price to earnings ratio. April 9th was a record for an advancing declining volume. That was that day when Trump said now&#39;s a good time to buy stocks. Um, and I think that tweet is going to go down in history because uh, you know, it did coincide with the low. Okay. Then you got a bounce and you&#39;re kind of consolidating and I think uh, we&#39;re going to resolve higher either immediately or over time. That&#39;s the history of Trump. volatility followed by upside resolution. Uh one month later you&#39;re up on average 5.2%, 10 month 3 months later 11.9% 6 months later 18.2% and 12 months later on average up 29.2. So uh hang on. You know we&#39;re on the Disney ride and uh and we&#39;re getting to the exciting parts here. Scott Brown. Last week, S&P opened lower by 2%, closed up more than 5%. May 1970 was the only other time we&#39;ve seen that. It marked a multi-year low, and stocks gained an additional 56%. That&#39;s a very small sample, Scott, but uh thank you for your service. All right. Big gains tend to lead to much higher prices. Uh here was what happened after 5% gain. uh very similar type of chart. So you were down a little bit 5 days out, but a month later you&#39;re up. Three months later, six months later, you&#39;re up almost 11%. 12 months later, up 27. So the the history supports good things happening. Uh car dealership, securing a loan hasn&#39;t been this easy. That&#39;s surprising. Car dealership guy, April 14th. Securing a car loan hasn&#39;t been this easy since December 2022. Access to auto loans pre-tariffs improved 3.1% year-over-year in March thanks to increases in approval rates, subprime loan share, and down payment percentages. But the number of borrowers who owe more on their loans than their cars are worth also continues to rise. And with the tariff uncertainty in the mix, only time will tell how this loosening will last. By the way, that&#39;s really good news for us because if people are upside down on their cars, they can&#39;t unload them in the used car market u because they got to they got to pay they got to pay off the loan which means the supply of used cars in theory should go down and the supply of new cars with better terms and incentives um is going up. So you might find a scenario where the people with used cars have to hold on to them, which is what helps Advanced Auto Parts, and the people looking to buy cars, you used or new, wind up getting better deals buying new cars versus used cars. Uh, and that helps Cooper Standard volumes. So I like that percentage of overbought and oversold stocks in the S&P 500. Uh, again, you can get the sense there. Volatility index closed above 50. the returns just get huge. One, two, three, four, five years out. When you buy stocks after the VIX closed above 50, it&#39;s day and night. I mean, you&#39;re talking a 55% spread if you did it five years out, buying stocks when the VIX is below 50 versus buying stocks when the VIX is above 50 like last week. Uh, pretty awesome. I&#39;m super excited for uh everyone that&#39;s with me and I&#39;m super excited for the ones that topped up a bit and uh came in fresh as well. Uh, but everyone&#39;s really going to do well based on where we are. Uh, most strategists see S&P rebounding by year end. Uh, widest gap in sellside S&P 500 targets this century. The last time you had this big a gap was 2009, 2002, and 20, I&#39;m sorry, 2009, 2022, and 2002. All times were times to buy. This is This is kind of funny. Democrats one-year inflation expectations are 8%. Republicans one-year inflation expectations are 1%. I mean, it&#39;s it&#39;s unreal. I I mean, people making investment decisions on the basis of their political outlook um is super dangerous. And and I look, I had to tell people during the Biden administration, oh, he&#39;s going to destroy the country. I&#39;m like, yeah, but stocks are going to go up, so have a nice day, you know, go take a chill pill. And same thing here. Trump&#39;s going to destroy the world. Yeah, but stocks are going to go up. So, go take a chill pill. Um, it&#39;ll get resolved. Retail flows as a percent of aggregate market cap. All right. Companies issuing EPS guidance. Earning season. Okay. So, they&#39;re still doing some level of guidance here. This shows you drawdowns. Pretty normal in the scheme of things. ratio of insider buyers versus insider sellers. Insider buying is picking up pretty materially. China retail sales and exports grew faster in March in the face of Trump&#39;s tariffs. Retail sales were the highest in over a year. Industrial production was the highest in over multiple years. Policy uncertainty index versus the S&P 500. So when policy uncertainty peaks tend to be near bottoms. China first quarter GDP tops estimates at 5.4% as growth momentum continues amid tariff worries. 63% of FMS fund manager survey. Investors expect China stimulus to boost growth in the second half of 2025. We agree. China retail sales value turning right back up. That helps Alibaba. uh S&P 600 quarterly EPS growth bottomup consensus. So Q1 they&#39;ve taken down and they think it&#39;s going to come back half back end loaded. We agree. Uh S&P EPS impact depending on the increase in tariff rate. Okay. So you&#39;re looking lowend 7% to 30 30 $7 to $35. All right. United States, they&#39;ve already taken it down seven. United States retail sales year were solid. They say that they&#39;re not confident, but they keep spending. So that&#39;s the difference between the hard data and soft data that we&#39;ve talked about. CEO confidence has fallen to its weakest since the great financial crisis. You know, this guy&#39;s always bearish. Um, and by the way, the last time it got this low was 2022, fall 2022. Many of these folks were super bearish in the hole in 2022. And that was the time to buy, not to sell. Manufacturing, someone&#39;s American dream. Uh, America would be better off if more Americans worked in manufacturing. That&#39;s funny. All Americans and Republican leaning Americans all say 80% say America would be better off if more Americans worked in manufacturing. And then um the percentage so that&#39;s 80% of people and then 20% say I would be better off if I worked in a factory. So it&#39;s like you know someone else should go work at the sweat shop, not me. But um so you kind of got to put this in perspective. I I kind of joke with my friends. I said, &quot;Look, we want people to install the robots, program the robots, monitor the robots, but not become the robots.&quot; Uh so we got to be careful on the type of policy that we wish for. Total foreign pol holdings of US equities, treasuries, and US credit. Foreigners own 18 point uh 18.5 uh 20% of the total equity market, 30% of treasuries, 30% of corporate credit, dollar index and US 10-year yields. Dollar index has been rolling over materially. This 10-year yield bump was kind of um a malfunctioning of the Treasury market which got resolved so far but has the administration on notice to get it get a deal done. All right. Median S&P stock bid assass spread highest since 2020 lows uh 2020 COVID lows. That&#39;s that was a buying time. Russell 3000 liquidity lowest since COVID. So, these are things that you&#39;re going to see if we don&#39;t get a deal soon, you&#39;re going to see liquidity facilities announced that are going to basically be QE under a different name. But, you can&#39;t quue QE your way to consumer confidence and earnings power. So, that will be a temporary solution if they don&#39;t get their act together and and take yes for an answer. uh unbalanced world share of global consumption manufacturing by regions. You can see that this is the balance that Trump wants to work out. We&#39;re going to talk about that in the article. Dollar change 2025 worst start to a year since 1995 for the US dollar. That was part of one of our key themes coming into the year. Inter US dollar weaker. Treasuries get bid. Okay, that started to happen except for this malfunctioning in the last week. um value outperforms growth, international outperforms US, small outperforms large. So, uh the latter hasn&#39;t worked. Many of the former have. I think the latter comes to play once a deal&#39;s inked. Uh stocks are not vote winners for Trump. Middle income households only have 10% of their assets. The other thing that they have to keep in mind, one that we&#39;ve said, if they push this too far, we will have a recession and uh it will be a absolute slaughterfest in the midterm election. So companies will then be able to uh they won&#39;t have to wait three and a half years to uh wait out Trump for making their investment decisions. They they&#39;ll have to wait one and a half years because he will have absolutely zero power after the midterms if they don&#39;t do a deal. If they do do a deal and they do this grand package, uh it could be another sweep, uh which means they&#39;ll be able to get everything done, including taxes, including everything else. So, all these things are in flux, but um point to, you know, it&#39;s kind of you can have the good outcome either the hard way or the easy way, your choice. And um Xi always chose the hard way. We&#39;re going to see if Trump follows the same pattern, but eventually she got his ass handed to him and had to flip the switch uh and shift his policy last year and we saw equities follow and do the right thing after he had exhausted all other possibilities. Uh and we&#39;re going to find out Trump Trump seems to be more proactive. if he likes to get the wins without the pain uh or at least as much of the pain and um you know volatility followed by upside resolution valuation discounts of small caps relative to midcap I mean the these you haven&#39;t had this opportunity since 2020 2001 which we keep going back to and uh that was a record you know the next five six years record out performance for small cap so ignore at your own underperformance peril S&P stock uh performance in 2025. So obviously defensive have have done well. If you back this up a month, this would look entirely different. Cuts like a knife. Net revision momentum for stocks. 12 month forward earnings per share. Obviously, everyone&#39;s downgrading uh estimates in the hole. Just like you saw Goldman Sachs on Monday, they put out a recession call uh at 100 p.m. And then at uh 1:30, Trump tweeted, &quot;We&#39;re going to do an exemption for the electronics.&quot; And then 2:00 they said, &quot;Did we say recession? We were, you know, if you can&#39;t take a joke.&quot; And then two days later they said, &quot;Well, yeah, I know. We took back our recession call. Now we&#39;re going to have a recession.&quot; I mean, these guys are clowns. Clowns without a circus. And uh it I I sympathize with them because it&#39;s it&#39;s not easy to make decisions when the earth keeps shifting underneath you and the rules of the game are unknown. So, uh, I definitely empathize with them, but you got to be less reactive and you got to look at, you know, Charlie Mer, big fan of and student of Charlie Mer is if you understand incentives, you can get a good sense of outcome. And you know, if you look at what are Trump&#39;s incentives, what are G&#39;s incentives, what is the world&#39;s incentives, eventually you know where this is going. The question is, do you know what you own so you can hold on long enough to get the benefits of where any rational thinker would know this is headed? And if you get there, then you use these opportunities uh to be better positioned than everyone else when it\n\nvaluation discounts of small caps relative to midcap I mean the these you haven&#39;t had this opportunity since 2020 2001 which we keep going back to and uh that was a record you know the next five six years record out performance for small cap so ignore at your own underperformance peril S&P stock uh performance in 2025.

And if you get there, then you use these opportunities uh to be better positioned than everyone else when it finally  occurs, which is what we&#39;ve done. If you don&#39;t know what you own and you just trade on price and momentum and what the crowd does and you&#39;re a sheep, sheep get slaughtered and uh that&#39;s what happens. you sell in the hole thinking you&#39;re going to be cute and buy lower and you think you&#39;re going to be able to time everything and those people just get destroyed. They get carried out on stretchers and then the thing is back at new highs and they&#39;re not benefiting and they&#39;re permanently impaired forever. Um so that&#39;s what we try to help you avoid each week with hedge fund tips with Tom Hayes. uh and um okay so a lot of people are feeling pain both the 6040 portfolio hasn&#39;t worked uh because of that malfunctioning it will work over time you&#39;ve always had periods like this where that happens eventually it re recovers uh bare market lows and forward return so you can see here average 12-month out 45.8 8 off the low.

We'll see if the deal and those are some of the components that I covered earlier in the show. The general idea behind a potential deal would involve China focusing more on domestic consumption and less on state subsidized manufacturing while the US cuts back a bit on consumption and builds up its manufacturing base. Alibaba being the toll taker, the top economic priority this year. Right now, consumption makes up about 55% of the overall GDP in China compared to 70 to 80% in wealthier nations. China's aiming to hit 70% by 2035. Consider 40 40% goes through Baba. That's $3.5 trillion. Uh you do the math. That's another 300 billion dollar of earnings. Put a 10 times multiple on that plus their existing business plus their AI. You got a $4 trillion company. So while everyone's waiting for Nvidia to hit 4 trillion, you might be waiting a long time.\n\nSo who's the best position to benefit? Alibaba, the totaker of the middle class, holding 40% of the e-commerce market still growing. It's hard to imagine they don't capture a massive slice of the pie. If a deal's reached between US and China, we'll probably see an even bigger push towards domestic consumption in China. And if tariffs stick around, China will have no choice but to shift towards consumption to make up for the hit export-driven GDP growth. Either way, Alibaba will be laughing all the way to the bank.\n\nIf a deal&#39;s reached between US and China, we&#39;ll probably see an even bigger push towards domestic consumption in China. And if tariffs stick around, China will have no choice but to shift towards consumption to make up for the hit export-driven GDP growth. Either way, Alibaba will be laughing all the way to the bank. It&#39;s also worth pointing out that China has a pretty powerful toolkit to speed up this shift towards domestic consumption, namely the long-awaited and much rumored bazooka style stimulus. Unlike its Western counterparts, China didn&#39;t pump out stimulus during the p pandemic. So, they have plenty of room to use both monetary and fiscal tools. That&#39;s a luxury US and Europe just don&#39;t have, and the market seems to have recognized and begun to price this in. So you can see here government debt to GDP. In fact, maybe this is why the Chinese government held back on pulling the trigger. Perhaps they saw a potential Trump 2.0 term and a trade war on the horizon. So they decided to hedge their bets and keep some of the ammo in reserve. Either way, they have the tools and more now more than ever. Good reason to use them. It&#39;s over $20 trillion sitting in household deposits waiting to be spent. It&#39;s time to be unleashed the bazooka. Shifting from domestic consumption and stimulus to a less exciting topic. We figured out it would be a good time to address the elephant in the room. something we thought was in the rearview mirror, which is delisting.\n### HEADLINES_AND_NEWS\nRumors began circulating this past week after Fox Business senior correspondent Charles Gasparina published a tweet below. Charles is a fantastic journalist, really good guy. I&#39;ve had dinner with him before. I know him. Um, and he&#39;s just reporting the information that he gets. Um, and then Brendan Ahern put out an article the next day breaking down. Look, there is  a desire. It&#39;s certainly a negotiating chip. I don&#39;t see a deal where China and the US cut a deal and China&#39;s access to US capital markets is removed. I like that is the nuclear option. If if Trump um cuts off their access to US capital markets, I think the trade war turns into a hot war. I&#39;ll just put it that way. Um, but the joke will be on the US because the only people that get hurt if they delist the US ADRs is US investors and pensions. Um, not the Chinese who own it in Hong Kong. So, uh, that would kind of be like if if if you&#39;re China and you&#39;re competing with the US, the best thing that could ever happen to you is they delist your stocks because number one, you just take your business to London and Hong Kong and international money will find you. it goes where it&#39;s treated best. Number two, $800 billion of investor capital of your opponent has been evaporated. And um so, you know, could there be people that stupid in the administration that would move forward with this? Of course. Um so, we&#39;re going to talk about how you hedge against that. Is the likelihood there that there will be no adult in the room to explain to them in English, like to a three-year-old what happens if you actually do this to yourself and you point the gun not at your opponent. It actually has a reverse uh huzzle that points right back at you. Uh we think so. And we know that the the right people are going to go down to Washington and explain this to them because it&#39;s understandable. You would think this is a way to hurt your enemy, but you know, they tried it with semiconductors and it was the worst thing they ever did. Hopefully, they learned from their mistakes. So, Brendan Ahern, good buddy of mine, he runs the KWEB ETF, number one ETF for China internet, uh, put out a great article the next day breaking down the rumors and laying out the facts. He also hosted a tariff briefing webinar that covered, among other things, delisting fears. I highly recommend you listen below. uh talks about we&#39;ve been to this movie before in the last few years. They went through the PCAOB uh etc. Part of it has to do with um Atkins, the new SEC chair, getting votes. You know, he won by 52 votes, so it was a tight vote and some of the people that put him over the top would like to see him explore this issue further. So, he&#39;s going to do that for sure. whether whether what he finds after exploring you know many months later uh is another discussion. The other risk you have is an executive order. Um so that&#39;s that. We&#39;re going to tell you what we&#39;re doing around that in a second. Fears around delisting are nothing new. We went through the same back cycle back in 202122 end up with the Chinese government stepping in changing its laws to allow the PCAOB full access to inspect the US listed Chinese companies. Alibaba along with nearly 300 other ADRs passed those audits with flying colors. Now that the PCAOB has had access to over two years, it&#39;s tough to see logical case for dellisting. The other funny thing is the the administration has this fantasy in their mind about golden shares that the P, you know, PRC owns big slugs of these companies and and the fact of the matter is all you have to do is look at the cap table. Okay, they certainly influence. I understand that. That&#39;s just like Trump is influencing Apple and Nvidia and uh shaking them down to invest in the US. That&#39;s a, you know, that&#39;s kind of a good thing, but they don&#39;t really have a choice in the matter. It&#39;s like do what I say or you&#39;re dead. Uh offer they can&#39;t refuse. So, I don&#39;t see how that&#39;s a whole lot different. But the fact of the matter is there are a clear number of shares outstanding. t\n\n### HEADLINES_AND_NEWS\nETF for China internet, uh, put out a great article the next day breaking down the rumors and laying out the facts.

So, I don&#39;t see how that&#39;s a whole lot different. But the fact of the matter is there are a clear number of shares outstanding. there is  a clear net income and the net income is divided by those shares outstanding which are disclosed in the uh in the in the public filings and the public holdings of who owns the company. So uh where this fantasy phantom owner is uh it doesn&#39;t make sense because when I divide share count by earnings power I get the exact number that they publish on the website along with every other uh company. So do they influence? Yes. Do they maybe have uh seats on different boards? Yes. Does the US influence our major comp companies now? Yes. Less so a few months ago. Now it&#39;s a major factor. Uh a little bit autocratic if if we&#39;re being objective about it. Uh but as far as them owning shares, it just doesn&#39;t foot. I mean, you could have a fantasy in your mind that that&#39;s the case, but if EPS matches S, it is what it is. Okay. So, uh, okay. So, now that PCAOB has had access to their data for two years, it&#39;s tough to see a logic a logical case for D-listing and betting on delisting or calling China uninvestable has been your belief the last couple years. It hasn&#39;t been a profitable one. But just as we discussed in last week&#39;s article, we need to burden ourselves with the facts, not the rumors, not the noise. What are the actual facts? And here they are. US ADRs are held by US investors, not the Chinese government or Chinese investors. Over $800 billion of US investor capital sits in 286 China ADRs. Dellisting China ADRs would do nothing but vaporize nearly a trillion dollars of US and cap US investor capital, including pension funds for teachers, firemen, police officers, uh etc. um union workers, okay, uh manufacturing people on the assembly line, uh all while the Chinese government laughs all the way to the bank. You basically just took the gun out and shot yourself and took a trillion dollars out of your firepower. Uh two, on the flip side, China old holds $1.3 trillion worth of US treasuries and about $370 billion worth of US equities. They could easily liquidate these in re retaliation. If lowering the 10-year yield is this administration&#39;s top priority. It&#39;s hard to believe they would cross the line, this line, and open the door for such retaliation. It&#39;s natural to make threats when you, you know, when you&#39;re negotiating to get what you want, but doing so would be the equivalent of shooting yourself in the foot on the world stage. And three, the US has the number one capital markets in the world because rumors like this don&#39;t happen. foreign companies, whether from China or elsewhere, pay enormous fees to list in the United States and go through all the regulatory hurdles in vetting. Weaponizing delisting for political purposes wouldn&#39;t exactly encourage foreign companies to IPO or list here in the future, and it would undermine the strength of American capital markets. Basically, you just push tens of billions of dollars of business to London and to Hong Kong. So, uh maybe that&#39;s another reason to be ex US equities uh and looking at opportunities in UK and Hong Kong. Now, if fears over D-listing are keeping you up at night, Baba shareholders can easily convert their US ADS&#39;s to Hong Kong listed shares.\n\nthe rumors, not the noise. What are the actual facts?

So, uh maybe that&#39;s another reason to be ex US equities uh and looking at opportunities in UK and Hong Kong. Now, if fears over D-listing are keeping you up at night, Baba shareholders can easily convert their US ADS&#39;s to Hong Kong listed shares.\n\nA step-by-step guide directly from Alibaba is listed below. Again, we see this as an unlikely scenario and a hard line is in the sand. What really matters is that you focus on what you can control. And when you buy high quality businesses, when they&#39;re marked down, good good things tend to follow. Alibaba is no different. So what we are doing, it it it&#39;s it&#39;s really funny. Literally a month ago, I was going to call our custodian and have all of our Hong Kong shares convert that we converted during this first fear converted back to Baba ADS&#39;s. And I was like, let&#39;s just hold off. So now I&#39;m going to make the call. Uh I have made the call. I&#39; I put it in two days ago. uh we&#39;re going to convert all of our USADS shares to Hong Kong. Not because we think anything&#39;s really going to happen, but we want to hedge against it. Um but we are keeping 100% of our US ADS derivatives because we really can&#39;t replicate the upside in those in any other instrument and we can&#39;t replicate them in Hong Kong. So where we come out is as a fiduciary we want to hedge our downside. If a nuclear option happens and it was some executive order delisting our options are probably wiped but because we own the shares in Hong Kong over time the equities on that theme China XUS will dramatically more than make up for getting wiped on the derivatives. Uh, so we have to hedge it so we can keep the derivatives. If I if I had to assign a probability of a of a highly stupid decision, I&#39;d put it at like 7 to 12%. But by straddling, you know, where most of our money is in the equities and putting that all in Hong Kong. So if we lose on the options, the stock over the next two years is going to make multiple times of that back and multiple times on the invested overall invested capital of both the derivatives and the stock. So that theme and position in the portfolio will do net exceptional even if the worst case scenario occurs. Um, and then if the best case scenario occurs, which is they just leave it alone and let markets do what markets do, uh, we&#39;ll we&#39;ll be at no disadvantage by owning the stocks in Hong Kong and we&#39;ll get the additional kicker benefit from all of our options uh, and derivatives based in the US. So, we&#39;ll get, you know, five bites at the Apple versus two bytes at the Apple. And that&#39;s the best way I could think of it because there&#39;s no other way to express the expected value on that little pocket of derivatives than the way we have it set up. And we want to ride that and we think that um the odds are in our favor, but we&#39;re hedging it out in if they&#39;re not and the nuclear option comes, we are prepared for it. we have the stock to to ride uh prospectively in Hong Kong and uh and it will more than make up for the the the loss in uh the USDS uh issue which again we assign a very low probability. So if I&#39;ve got a 10% probability I&#39;m not going to give up a 5 to 7 5 to 7x expected value over the next 12 to 24 months. I&#39;m just not going to do it. Especially when the percentage of the overall assets is small but the upside is so big. And that&#39;s how we&#39;re just managing it as fiduciaries in that pocket of our portfolio that&#39;s dedicated to China to just hedge against any very small outside risk but not nothing risk and that&#39;s all we can do. So the earth shifts underneath us every single day. Uh it doesn&#39;t change the underlying business. the underlying business is only going to get better regardless of the outcome. But how do we ensure that we&#39;re in a position to guarantee take advantage of it and more likely than not take advantage of it in every single way possible under the sun and that&#39;s really what we want to do and that&#39;s what we are going to do. So that&#39;s how we&#39;re dealing with it. You do what you do. I mean, I rode out PCAOB with a ton of US ads and uh and really didn&#39;t blink because I knew if if there was a legal respect and framework that ultimately it wouldn&#39;t be delisted and that&#39;s exactly what happened. uh I have to be open to the dimminimous possibility that a legal framework is not respected and that&#39;s why we&#39;ve taken action and made the request two days ago uh and uh should be executed uh shortly. So, um, and my guess is at these levels, I mean, we we bought plenty of BABA last week, by the way. That&#39;ll become 9988, uh, probably tonight or tomorrow, and we look forward to buying more. So, nothing in our thesis has changed. Where we hold the bulk of our money that&#39;s committed to the idea, i.e. in the stock, uh, is going to change just just as a hedge. Uh and because the odds are 90% in our favor that the nuclear option will not be triggered, uh we do nothing with this small piece of our overall assets that has a monstrous upside expected value of, you know, 5x plus uh and we&#39;re going to just ride ride or die on that small piece. And that&#39;s what we always do in the derivative bucket anyway. So uh super excited about that. Fear and greed down here. Buyer not seller. National Association of Active Investment Managers turning up. So that&#39;s good from very low levels. ADR dlisting risk back in focus. This is from Goldman Sachs. I think John sent this. Um I think they go through all the history basically assigning a low probability. Uh here are some of the things that would happen. Following summarizes a simplified procedure for dellisting from an investor&#39;s perspective based on historical precedence. Investors sell before the last day of the ADR trading after 10 days of the filing of form 25 with the SEC. Investors will be able to freely trade and sell the soontobe delisted stock on US exchanges at prevailing market price before the securities last trading day in the US. B. Investors could continue to trade the shares on the OTC market subject to their mandate and investment scope. For instance, Luck and Coffee, LKNCY, was delisted from the NASDAQ on June 29, 2020, but its shares are still trading on the over-the-counter market. Um, so that is um I think BABA has an over-the-counter uh version also called BABAF uh which trades in line with the underlying ADS and with the Hong Kong share prices anyway. And any difference will be arbed out. So you don&#39;t really have to worry about where it&#39;s traded and getting a huge discount because if there&#39;s a huge discount, someone will arb that out over time. Uh C, investors can trade on other exchanges as the stock is listed on a major other exchange and can return their ADS and um withdraw the equivalent deposited security i.e. Hong Kong shares uh based on previous cases even after the effective D-listing date. So you don&#39;t have to do this now at all. Uh and D investors p receive the net proceeds upon the termination of the ADR program. Investors take no action uh before and 6 months after. Oh, listen to this. If investors take no action before and 6 months after the D-listing date, the depository will commence the sale of ordinary shares represented by unreturned ADRs at prevailing market price if listed elsewhere. So you&#39;ll basically get the Hong Kong price in cash and pay the net cash proceeds after applicable fees and expenses to the ADR shareholders. So basically, if you do nothing and it stops trading, what this is saying from go Gold Goldman Sachs is it&#39;ll just send you your money at the Hong Kong price. Um, but we don&#39;t want cash, we want appreciation. Uh, and this is just getting started. So, you know, reading this, my inclination is to again do nothing, but uh, as a fiduciary, my inclination is to hedge that risk. So, uh, in my, you know, so that&#39;s that energy earnings, you know, look, I have a monstrous amount of personal exposure and a monstrous amount of derivative exposure. I&#39;m doing nothing with my derivatives. Completely comfortable with that. With the stock, we do all the the same across the board. So, um, so that&#39;s how we play out. I think net effect is it&#39;s going to be a net positive. Um, and then in three and a half years I can convert back to ads&#39;s. Can&#39;t make this stuff up. All right. Energy top. Okay. So, uh, energy earnings down 3.9%. Everyone&#39;s taking down their estimates. Defense earnings top 30 ways down 1.9% next year down 6. Uh those will go back up if we get the resolution. [Music] Uh economic data we covered. Estimates have gone from 275 down to uh 268. So estimates continue to come down and now we&#39;re going to do the\n\nr other exchange and can return their ADS and um withdraw the equivalent deposited security i.e. Hong Kong shares uh based on previous cases even after the effective D-listing date. So you don&#39;t have to do this now at all. Uh and D investors p receive the net proceeds upon the termination of the ADR program. Investors take no action uh before and 6 months after. Oh, listen to this. If investors take no action before and 6 months after the D-listing date, the depository will commence the sale of ordinary shares represented by unreturned ADRs at prevailing market price if listed elsewhere. So you&#39;ll basically get the Hong Kong price in cash and pay the net cash proceeds after applicable fees and expenses to the ADR shareholders. So basically, if you do nothing and it stops trading, what this is saying from go Gold Goldman Sachs is it&#39;ll just send you your money at the Hong Kong price. Um, but we don&#39;t want cash, we want appreciation. Uh, and this is just getting started. So, you know, reading this, my inclination is to again do nothing, but uh, as a fiduciary, my inclination is to hedge that risk. So, uh, in my, you know, so that&#39;s that energy earnings, you know, look, I have a monstrous amount of personal exposure and a monstrous amount of derivative exposure. I&#39;m doing nothing with my derivatives. Completely comfortable with that. With the stock, we do all the the same across the board. So, um, so that&#39;s how we play out. I think net effect is it&#39;s going to be a net positive. Um, and then in three and a half years I can convert back to ads&#39;s. Can&#39;t make this stuff up. All right. \n### MACRO_DATA_SLIDES\nEnergy top. Okay. So, uh, energy earnings down 3.9%. Everyone&#39;s taking down their estimates. Defense earnings top 30 ways down 1.9% next year down 6. Uh those will go back up if we get the resolution. [Music] Uh economic data we covered. Estimates have gone from 275 down to uh 268. So estimates continue to come down and now we&#39;re going to do the\n### ASK_ME_ANYTHING_QA\n\nquestions . Uh so for those of you who don&#39;t like the\n\n### ASK_ME_ANYTHING_QA\nJT investor asks, &quot;Thanks for posting the information on ADRs. Could you please clarify if investing in KWEB fully avoids the risk of Dellisting?&quot; Uh, I would say, uh, in his Forbes article, he said that I think 16% of his portfolio was US ads that uh, didn&#39;t have a version in Hong Kong that he could quickly convert to. So, those would probably just be cashed out and he would reinvest those in Hong Kong shares. So, I think uh it&#39;s perfectly fine to be in Kb as far as I understand. Uh so, I wouldn&#39;t worry about that and I would go ahead and go to Headphone Tips, go to the article. I listed his podcast. I&#39;m sure he explains all that, but uh no, I don&#39;t think I&#39;d have any problem investing in K web at all.\n\nLineage. Okay. Okay. Lineage L I N E. Yeah, I don&#39;t do companies that haven&#39;t been public for many years to be honest with you. So, uh, I have to see how they operate through multiple cycles because I it&#39;s it&#39;s very hard. Let&#39;s see what the balance sheet looks like. 170 of cash, six billion of debt. So that&#39;s not a good ratio to have 100 million in cash and six billion in debt in this environment or any environment. So for me, I mean, they&#39;re generating a lot of cash. I think you&#39;ve really got to do a lot of work on this to get comfortable with it and uh it&#39;s not going to happen on this call. So for for me I would it would just be an easy quick pass. I&#39;m like I don&#39;t need that to make something like that work. Ralph Reynolds you think Cooper Sander will be able to make up domestic market reductions through growth in China partners? Seems like BYD is a customer\n\n### ASK_ME_ANYTHING_QA\nhe would reinvest those in Hong Kong shares. So, I think uh it&#39;s perfectly fine to be in Kb as far as I understand. Uh so, I wouldn&#39;t worry about that and I would go ahead and go to Headphone Tips, go to the article. I listed his podcast. I&#39;m sure he explains all that, but uh no, I don&#39;t think I&#39;d have any problem investing in K web at all. Um so, there&#39;s that. And he&#39;s a good manager and uh leave it there. Okay. So, we got Cole&#39;s picture. Uh, can you look at lineage? This is from Gasper Mohoric Cold Storage [Music] Company. Lineage. Okay. Okay. Lineage L I N E. Yeah, I don&#39;t do companies that haven&#39;t been public for many years to be honest with you. So, uh, I have to see how they operate through multiple cycles because I it&#39;s it&#39;s very hard.

I&#39;m like I don&#39;t need that to make something like that work. Ralph Reynolds you think Cooper Sander will be able to make up domestic market reductions through growth in China partners? Seems like BYD is a customer CEO reference plants within China. Uh partially I don&#39;t think you&#39;re going to see the again going back to this call row. Um I don&#39;t think it&#39;s going to be I think it&#39;s going to be better than expected. I think Q1 was amazing and I think that uh making up for the inventories once they come up with a deal\n\nhurts in light of Aman thoughts on Starbucks. Uh, let&#39;s see. Hurts. I really have no interest in. Um, I hope it works for Bill and um and it probably will. He&#39;s buying it with enough margin of safety, but um it&#39;s not a business I want to own long term. Um Starbucks SBUX is obviously down on the China. They might have to sell the Chinese b business. There&#39;s not enough margin of safety for me here. So, yeah, it&#39;s a good business and everything else. And I wouldn&#39;t bet against the Chipotle guy. He&#39;s going to figure it out. But, you know, talk to me if it gets down. Well, it&#39;s at 80. I was going to say talk to me if it gets below 100. It&#39;s at 80. All right. Uh, let&#39;s see. Yeah, I think for the long term, you&#39;re okay betting on this guy and this business. Uh, but I think you also might have an opportunity to get it a little cheaper. There&#39;s a lot of competition. Dutch Bros, everything else. I I would just I mean to say I&#39;d buy it at 70 or 75 and I wouldn&#39;t buy it at 8085 is pretty silly if it&#39;s a longterm thing, but that&#39;s kind of where I come out. Um, all right. Next, Matt Mitchell LVMH. I got to say, uh, yeah, I do want to buy these, but after seeing those China manufacturing videos on Tik Tok, gives me a little pause because kind of the the gig is up. I I I would I would wait on this. I I I understand like backward looking it&#39;s a complete no-brainer at these levels based on the fundamentals, but I would just probably step aside. Jason Moore, my son and I listen to your podcast each week. Thanks for all you do. AES, thank you for watching. AES, I mean, you got a utility. What&#39;s the dividend yield? Pretty sure that&#39;s a utility. 7% yield. Yeah, I guess you just got to look at their cap table, but I mean their capital structure for debt refinance, but I generally think you&#39;re okay with that 7% yield. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Let me rephrase that. What the hell is going on here? I I would just avoid this. This This is crazy for a utility. Where are these guys? is based in Virginia. All right. If you can get unshakable confidence that this negative free cash flow is over, maybe. But this is this is no bueno. So for I I wouldn&#39;t even waste time on it. Um there&#39;s not enough upside to take that kind of risk. If the if the upside, you know, if this thing could be a 10 bagger once they get it to cash flow positive or five bagger, yes. But like to make 50% and collect a 7% yield for possible existential risk, hell no. Chris Williamson, MU looks interesting here. Getting close to the bottom of the cycle. Okay, then buy it. I don&#39;t I don&#39;t know if that&#39;s a question or an or what, but um I&#39;m I&#39;m not a fan of MU. That&#39;s been a You might be right. I I just It&#39;s such a sick I I&#39;ll tell you what&#39;s what what&#39;s not going to happen is you&#39;re not going to get a triple or quadruple. And in Intel, if they do it half right, that&#39;s what&#39;s going to happen. So why would I screw around with this? Manique, is Charles Payne short or are you should have been in the NBA? How tall are you? Number one, Charles Payne is not short. Uh he&#39;s uh he&#39;s tall, tall, handsome guy. Uh two, I&#39;m 6&#39;5. And three, I think it&#39;s camera angle because like I said in his old studio, they did not look like there was that much stuff, but uh it is what it is. Brian Norman, what are your thoughts on Trump administration considering D-listing we just covered? Delete. Nicholas Wang with depressed car volumes now for 20. What are you talking about? What numbers are you looking at? We had record numbers in the month of March. So, burden yourself with the facts. Thank you for the question and thank you for tuning in. Must be in the blue line category where he thinks inflation is going to be 8%. Uh, Mr. Hayes. Okay. So, he&#39;s got a question on Matt Hollerin, longtime supporter, wants to do floor and decor, which we did on the podcast a few weeks ago, and I think we said fine. It&#39;s a home building play, home building recovery play, and yes, we do like it. Good work. Ah, let me just take a look here. I think you&#39;re a little early, buddy, but you&#39;re close. So, if you&#39;re thinking three years out, you could buy it here. If you&#39;re thinking longer, I just wait a little bit. What&#39;s the debt like? Yeah, they&#39;re fine there. So, so yeah, I think you&#39;re okay. I think you can probably get a little better price. I mean, if you get low 60s, you&#39;re probably I think you&#39;re okay here. Uh, good work. [Music] Uh next is from from thanks for your Carl Johnson. What would you say are the top three or four stocks in your portfolio biggest upside potential? I think you just equal weight 10 good ideas. Um, obviously we like Baba, obviously we like Cooper Standard, uh, but they&#39;re they&#39;re all this tariff thing created such amazing opportunities and my clients know which ones are our favorite based on the waiting in their portfolio and I&#39;ll leave that benefit to them. But for listening in, if you like some of the names, just equal weight them because you&#39;re never going to predict which ones go first. Some are going to double in less than a year and some are going to take three or four years. But if you&#39;ve got a basket of them, you&#39;re going to do great. Um, all right. Got that one. AJ Barley Cooper standard has a billion dollars in debt in three years. Market&#39;s currently pricing blah blah blah. Yeah. So, listen to the uh interview that I did with him. Welcome to the podcast. You&#39;re obviously new. Um, we did 38 minutes on we did a one-hour interview. Go to hedge fund tips at the YouTube channel. We discussed all of this. All right, next. Griffin Griffin Brown says, &quot;Typically listen podcast on our way to work. Recently started watching the podcast and it&#39;s much more beneficial.&quot; It&#39;s like three three times more valuable to be able to see it versus listen to it. But if all you can do is listen to it, I&#39;m glad to deliver that value as well. Uh do you typically use Koifin for your valuations and ratios or do you like to do them yourself using numbers from the 10K? Always go to source numbers if we&#39;re going to put um this is just for screening and a quick look to see if we should do real work, but no, everything comes from the public filings and we double and triple check everything. Um, GTN. That&#39;s from Keenan Martins. GTN. Great television. All right. I know the guy who runs this, he also has an insurance company I wanted to get involved in. [Music] Um, I understand what you&#39;re saying. You&#39;re generally right, but there are factors that you don&#39;t know that you don&#39;t know. So, uh, for me, it&#39;s a pass. Uh, Tom, you&#39;re the bacon bringinger. Okay, so this is about the CEO of Intel having Chinese investments through his fund coming under scrutiny. Look, the guy is Chinese. He was vetted by the board of directors. If he has to unwind some of his Chinese investments that his fund is in, he&#39;ll unwind some of his Chinese investments. He was on the board, he had the same investments. That that was just noise last week. Uh, and that&#39;s it. So,\n\nGTN. That's from Keenan Martins. GTN. Great television. All right. I know the guy who runs this, he also has an insurance company I wanted to get involved in. ### HEADLINES_AND_NEWS\nOkay, so this is about the CEO of Intel having Chinese investments through his fund coming under scrutiny. Look, the guy is Chinese. He was vetted by the board of directors. If he has to unwind some of his Chinese investments that his fund is in, he'll unwind some of his Chinese investments.

    "MEDIA_APPEARANCE_RECAP": "\n\nI think we&#39;re there or close. There&#39;s a saying, Stu, out of crisis comes opportunity. If you look at Trump 1.0 trade war in 2018, the market fell 20% into December. Four months later, it was at new highs. If you think this is going to take a little longer, we look at the European debt crisis in 2011. Market fell 20%. Eight months later, the market was at new highs. But I think you&#39;re there. Maybe you go back and retest. I heard my buddy Kenny Pulkari earlier on the show. That&#39;s certainly a possibility. But, uh, this is the time when you want to be buying high quality businesses for the long term and keep your head, keep your cool. Easier said than done. You got two stocks that you particularly like. Let&#39;s start with Boeing. Why do you like them? Well, uh, in the context on focusing what you on what you can control and buying good assets when they&#39;re marked down, you&#39;ve got one of the best businesses in the world. A duopoly with a half a trillion dollar backlog with a new CEO, Kelly Ortberg, is turning turning the ship around just like you did at Rockwell Collins. Uh, 10-year backlog. This is a great business duopoly and not going to be as impacted by tariffs simply because if you want a plane, you can go to them or you can go to Airbus and that&#39;s about it. How about Disney? That&#39;s been badly beaten down. You It&#39;s in a dip. You buying the dip? There&#39;s no question about it. If you can own Boeing under 160 for the long term, if you can own Disney under 90 for the long term, the parks are, you know, decades and decades of emote. the experiences, the cruise ships, high return on invested capital, and their streaming has shown resiliency, growth, and stability. So, we like this business for the long term, and we love it under 80. Well, it&#39;s at 85. No, you mean you love it under 90? Under 90, under 80? You know, look, Stu, if you look back in two years, whether you bought it at $100, whether you bought it at $90, whether you bought it at $85, you&#39;re going to look back and pat yourself on the back. This is going to be a lot higher. Well, that would be nice. Okay, Tom, thanks for joining us. The bell is ringing. That means the trading begins in about 10 seconds. And we&#39;re back then.\n### MEDIA_APPEARANCE_RECAP\n\n\nIf you can own Boeing under 160 for the long term, if you can own Disney under 90 for the long term, the parks are, you know, decades and decades of emote. the experiences, the cruise ships, high return on invested capital, and their streaming has shown resiliency, growth, and stability. So, we like this business for the long term, and we love it under 80. Well, it's at 85. No, you mean you love it under 90? Under 90, under 80? You know, look, Stu, if you look back in two years, whether you bought it at $100, whether you bought it at $90, whether you bought it at $85, you're going to look back and pat yourself on the back. This is going to be a lot higher.\n### MEDIA_APPEARANCE_RECAP\nI had the pleasure to join Mattie Mills on Monday morning. Uh, want to thank Mattie Mills, Justinifer, just excuse me, Matty Mills, Justin Oliver, Cheyenne Reed for having me on for the full hour. Stephen did a good job cutting 60 minutes into 15 minutes so you can get all the key spots.\n\n### MEDIA_APPEARANCE_RECAP\nUh one one day you could wake up and and you see this beautiful tweet that says, &quot;I just got off the phone with Xihinping and the market rallies.&quot; Uh two analoges I&#39;m looking at, Maddie. First and foremost was Trump 1.0 trade war. We had a 20% correction in uh 2018. It took four months to recover to new highs. And then if we get a little more volatility with all the negotiating, we go back to 2011 and look at the European debt crisis. We have some debt rumblings here with US treasuries. That took 3 months and it was extremely volatile uh volatile. However, once you you nearly touch that 20%, the bottom was in. So, we&#39;re pretty sanguin and pretty constructive to buy stocks at these levels.\n\nWell, I think it&#39;s it&#39;s what you want to get in terms of return. So, we look for some of the beaten down sectors because we want to get excess return over time. Uh, one of the groups that we&#39;re looking at is homebuilders. Believe it or not, you can&#39;t give them away right now, but we like a gentleman named Brad Jacobs. He wrote a book, How to Make a Few Billion. And it&#39;s it&#39;s useful because he actually made a few billion. And he&#39;s put 1 billion of his own money in his new project called QXO. This is a building supply rollup play. Uh if you had invested with him in the past, whether it was United Rentals, if you put a million dollars in when he got involved in 1997, you made $79 million to date. If you got involved with XPO Logistics when he got involved, he put 150 million in in 2009, you would have made something like $160 million, 160x.\n\n### MEDIA_APPEARANCE_RECAP\ncoming into earnings, are you comfortable with the valuation 37 times forward? You got a $400 billion enterprise value on 7 billion of free cash flow. You know, that kind of compares to Disney, for instance. They&#39;ve got 8.5 billion of free cash flow and maybe 190 billion enterprise value. Oh, and by the way, you get the parks and you get the experiences and you get the cruise ships for free. um just talk about what that means in terms of exceeding expectations and now that they&#39;re not reporting subscribers and you&#39;ve seen Disney kind of stall at 178 million subscribers and Netflix maybe stall at 300 million subscribers. Uh what are your thoughts on the relative value? I mean it&#39;ll be interesting to see how the fundamentals actually shake out and what we what kind of commentary we actually get from senior management. They&#39;re going to guide the market. they&#39;re going to give us that strategic conviction in terms of whether we believe the Bulls or the Bears. Like whose assumptions do we go with? And in terms of Disney, we can&#39;t forget that they have a substantial amount of their business in the Far East. So they are also exposed. And you know, I think net net it&#39;ll be interesting to see who&#39;s the bumper in this.\n\nfocus on what you can control when the markets marked down like this. What if you focus on buying highquality companies that are marked down? One of the companies we were buying last week aggressively was uh Disney at $85. You don&#39;t have to think hard about Disney. It&#39;s down from $200. Over the next few years, it&#39;s going to recover. Tariffs or no tariffs, it&#39;s going to be okay. Boeing was a company we were adding to. it got down to1 $129 down from $350 some odd dollars. This is a duopoly in in in the aircraft space. So if you buy great companies and you and you have a long-term view 12 to 24 months, you&#39;re going to do great out of this opportunity. To that end, Nvidia was under $100 a couple weeks ago as well. So certainly something to keep in mind.\n\n### QUOTES_OF_THE_WEEK\nI learned early on in the business, good things happen to people who buy highquality companies at low prices. And that&#39;s all you can do right now. On every red day, you look for an opportunity to buy great businesses. You know, last week, Boeing got down to $130 a share. Disney got down to $85 a share. These are down more than 50% from their peaks. These are things you can go to bed, wake up, not even having to worry about. You got two new ideas, Sarxo. I don&#39;t think a lot of folks are familiar with this one. This is Brad Jacobs new rollup. It&#39;s a building supply company. This guy knows how to make money for shareholders. If you had invested $1 million with him and when he did URI, you made $74 million to date. If you had done the same exact thing with QXO in 2009, you made $160 million. So, we&#39;ve got 4 million units housing shortage in the US. Donald Trump has said, &quot;We&#39;re opening up federal lands. Not only do you get your starter home from KB Homes, you get an endangered elk in the backyard free of charge.&quot; They are going to be supplying. They just did beacon roofing supply. They paid 10 times Ibida. He&#39;s going to double that IBIDA with with technology, with tuck in acquisitions. This is one you buy, you tuck away for five to 10 years, and you&#39;re gonna wind up with an eight to10 bagger. And comtock. Comtock we gave on your show January of 2024 around $9. It&#39;s now up double. We think it can double again. Why? Part of the negotiations with the EU are going to be about we&#39;ll lower your tariffs. You&#39;re going to take all of our LNG. Uh Jerry Jones owns 70% of this stock. The unproved reserves are worth another $20 a share. We like this here.\n\nan enormous premium on certainty for your economy. That&#39;s on the one side. On the other side, Kevin has it was on the network saying, &quot;We&#39;ve got bundles of deals.&quot; Well, the administration needs to take yes for an answer because the minute we take yes for an answer, it shows that we&#39;re ready to do business. We don&#39;t need to have self-inflicted pain. What we need is some certainty with the deals so we can get focused on earnings, growth, and tax cuts. Yeah. If we if we get tax cuts and we get some certainty on tariffs, if we do, you got a market that goes straight up, do we? That&#39;s right. You know what? The market is a discounting mechanism. The minute we see those bundles of deals come across the tape, companies can start to give guidance. Once companies can give guidance, we have some level of certainty and there are a lot of tremendous bargains in the market right now. Money is going to want to go to work as we get a little bit more certainty. All right, Tom, thanks very much for analyzing the market this morning. We appreciate it. Thanks for having me. \n### MEDIA_APPEARANCE_RECAP\nSo we had a lot of volatility last week. This feels like a little bit more normaly now or at least trying to kind of figure out how do we get back to normal. Um you pointed out that this is the first correction where seasoned pros seem more fearful than retail investors. Um I&#39;m surprised to hear that. But how did you arrive at that assessment? Yeah, well incoming phone calls. I mean, I have peers in the business that were calling me in literally abject fear and me kind of walking them off the ledge and saying, &quot;This too shall pass.&quot; You know, if you look at the data, uh, retail investors have actually been buying in the hole on this correction and hedge funds have had record selling in the hole. And what&#39;s interesting about that, most people say, &quot;Well, the dumb money smart money.&quot; Let me tell you something. The retail investors have been right since co they have been buying weakness while professionals have been selling weakness and the retail investors have been correct and I think this is going to be the case again. But was some of that fear warranted? I&#39;m not saying one should feed into fear but like when we saw that volatility last week obviously we&#39;ve cooled since then on volatility when we look at the VIX it&#39;s not at those historic levels that we saw. Um, but you know, when you&#39;re in this daily, you&#39;ve experienced that turbulence before, it does kind of trigger it triggers a a memory that wasn&#39;t great. That&#39;s right. That&#39;s right. Look, the the administration has to learn to take yes for an answer. Okay. They have deals on the table or as Kevin Hasset would say bundles of deals on the table and all they need what you need to see is one credible deal roll across the tape and then the market will realize there&#39;s some rationality in the administration. They&#39;re going to move ahead. Things are going to be okay. Uh we&#39;re just in the period of uncertainty and the way that you get through that is you focus on what you can control and all you can control is buying high quality businesses when they&#39;re on sale. I learned very early in the business, good things happen to people who buy highquality assets when they&#39;re marked down. And you know, irrespective of how long it takes to get a deal, if it takes So here&#39;s two two analoges. Trump 1.0 in 2018, trade war market corrected 20%. It recovered Vshape within 4 months to new highs. Could that happen? That&#39;s a possibility. We&#39;re slightly more in the camp. It&#39;s going to be like the 2011 European debt cris where you had a 20% correction and then three months of hell non-stop volatility and then 8 months later you were at new highs. Really quickly, I know you&#39;ve got a couple of uh picks, but I want to ask you that point about volatility. Although we&#39;re not at that level that we saw last week, which reminded people included of the uh GFC. Um, is volatility here to stay or at least during this presidential term? Yeah. Uh, well, the the history of President Trump is volatility followed by upside resolution. And that&#39;s his formula. He knows how to push it to the edge and then break through and the market resolves higher. So, I think you just have to on a company by company basis buy quality that you don&#39;t have to worry about, not speculative stocks. and we&#39;re going to find we wake up one morning and he says, &quot;I just spoke to my good friend Xihinping and the market&#39;s up 5,000 points.&quot; He does call his good friend. I mean, it&#39;s an interesting characterization there. But, okay, let&#39;s talk about your picks. Um, especially given your views on how you want to buy things, where you see opportunity, potential sale. CRK is on your list. Comtock Resources. Now, you picked this a year ago or a little more than a year ago, right? It&#39;s been a winner since then, up more than 100%. Um, why are you still bullish? Where do you see it going? I think part of the tariff negotiations is particularly with Europe is going to be you want a reduction in tariffs. You need to take all of our LNG. Okay. They need our LG. We have it in abundance. They need to take it. And they&#39;re going to want to do that deal. Uh, Comtock Resources, 70% owned by Jerry Jones, who owns the Cowboys. uh the proved reserves that they report to the SEC which is 10 years of drilling are worth about uh $8 billion. The enterprise value is around $8 billion. However, their unproved reserves which they do not report uh is another 15 years of drilling. Okay. So, we think that&#39;s worth um about $10 billion which means we think not only it doubled since we talked about it, we think it can double one more time over the next 12 to 24 months. Is there still a push for LG given the Trump administration&#39;s uh not the same focus on converting to more um I&#39;m finding I&#39;m trying to find the word how you care I mean it&#39;s considered a better better for the environment. Uh that&#39;s a good question. You mean he&#39;d prefer coal? Well you look you can&#39;t make it up. Well, I think he wants everything and we&#39;re going to need everything to power the data centers, to power the increased demand, whether it&#39;s EVs, whether it&#39;s data centers, uh, unlimited demand and globally unlimited demand. So, that&#39;s a great way to play it. Okay, your next ticker, QXO. Now, look, that&#39;s a different pick than this in terms of its performance. Uh, I mean, with Comtock Resources, that&#39;s outperformed the S&amp;P 500 uh this day. But QXO, this seems like a little bit of a Where does it go? Yeah, this is a relatively new position for us. This is Brad Jacobs. Brad Jacobs is a winner. He makes money for shareholders. If you had invested a million bucks with him when he started United Rentals in 1997 when he got involved, you&#39;re up 70 some odd, 74x, $74 million. If you did XPO logistics in 2009, he came in, he put 150 million bucks of his own money, bought stock, you&#39;re up 160%, 1 million became 160 million. Now he&#39;s doing a roll up. Same formula, different industry in building products. You got 75 million millennials, 34. They want to buy houses. They can&#39;t afford them. So Besson&#39;s going to deregulate banks, bring down Treasury yields below uh 4%. Okay? Hopefully the good way. Not through not through a recession, but the good way. Uh that will make housing affordable. And Trump is opening, you know, we got 500 million acres of federal land. He&#39;s opening that up to build all these starter homes. So KB Homes will build your starter home. You get an endangered elk free of charge in your backyard. And Brad Jacobs is going to provide all of the building supplies. He&#39;s going to do a rollup. He&#39;s going to add technology. He started with Beacon Roofing Supply. When your roof is leaking, it&#39;s a non-discretionary expense. You don&#39;t think about should we buy a new roof? You have to buy a new roof. I mean, you could patch it, but yeah. Yeah. So, the history of Brad Jacobs is you put money in, you don&#39;t think about it for 5 to 10 years. And this will be 5, six, seven bagger. Uh, at the least, and if history is any prologue, it&#39;ll be a lot more than that. Okay. Potentially a 10 bagger, I think. So, I&#39;d always bet on Brad Jacobs. He is serious. He wrote a book, How to Make a Few Billion. That&#39;s pretty useful because he actually made a few billion dollars. All right. And last, but certainly not least, I really enjoyed this interview with Kristen Scher on NYSE Live. Want to thank Kristen, obviously, and Mel Montana. No relation to Tony Montana from Scarface whatsoever. Mel is fantastic. Mel and uh Kristen are the dream team. We&#39;ll listen in here. Welcome back to NYC TV Live, everyone. I&#39;m Christine Scherer here in studio. Well, stocks are looking at a negative open after what was a muted action yesterday and of course two straight days of gains for the S&amp;P before that. Well, joining me now with more on where we&#39;re headed from here and how investors should respond to all of this is Thomas Hayes. He&#39;s a chair and managing member at Great Hill Capital. Uh Thomas, always great to have you. Great to be here, Kristen. All right, so what do you make of all this market action of late? Uh you want the good news or the bad news? Let&#39;s start with the good news. Okay. Okay. Well, the good news is the same as the bad news, and that&#39;s everyone is pessimistic. Okay. So, you saw the fund manager survey from Bank of America this week. Uh, highest expectations of a recession, fourth highest uh in 20 years. So, we&#39;re talking about 2022, we&#39;re talking about 2020, we&#39;re talking about 2009. Uh, most number of managers wanting to go underweight US equities. So, usually that&#39;s a wash out. And what we&#39;re seeing is the quote unquote dumb money is now the new smart money. Retail investors have been buying a ton of stock on this weakness. Hedge funds have been recordelling in the hole and oddly enough retail investors have been right since co. So let&#39;s talk about what these tariffs mean for companies and and how companies might respond to them. Of course we&#39;re at the beginning of earning season. Thomas, what&#39;s your expectation especially when it comes to guidance? That&#39;s the big deal. I mean the big problem is companies can&#39;t guide in this period of uncertainty and uh Kevin Hasset was was on one of the networks yesterday uh or two days ago now saying we have bundles of deals with amazing terms. Well my message to the administration is how about taking yes for an answer. Uh you saw Vietnam come to the table and they said we&#39;ll do zero tariffs if you do zero tariffs. I understand there&#39;s uh non-tariff barriers, but what the answer should have been was we accept in principle contingent upon working out the non-tariff barriers. Instead, they did not. And what happened? China went to visit Vietnam and they just inked a deal. So, you snooze, you lose. I think the administration has a lot of good things going. They should book one deal and that&#39;s going to give companies more certainty to say, &quot;Hey, here are our three guidance scenarios. If they continue to do deals, good things are going to happen. And if they don&#39;t, medium things are going to happen. And if they really don&#39;t, here are the bad things that could happen. And then the market can kind of get their hands around it. But right now, we&#39;re just shooting in the wind. So we are probably down still about, let&#39;s say, 14% roughly on the S&amp;P 500 from a recent high. Do you think it is rangebound until we get a little bit more certainty? Yeah, we have two frameworks. One would be Trump tariff war 1.0. In 2018, you had a 20% correction. Yes. And then you were at new highs four months later. That&#39;s a possibility. We would love that. Uh the second scenario that we&#39;re looking at is the 2011 European debt crisis. 20% correction and then 3 months of hell, choppy volatility. Even though the bottom was kind of in marginal new lows, it was literally up and down every day for three months of uncertainty until Mario Draghy came out and said, &quot;We&#39;ll do whatever it takes.&quot; So, we need one of those moments. So either way, but even in that case, eight months later, we were at new highs. So I learned early in the business, Kristen, good things happen to people who buy highquality businesses when they&#39;re marked down. And I think this time will be no different. What are some of the high quality names, Thomas, that are on your radar? Yeah, I think number one, don&#39;t give up on PayPal. Everyone is down on PayPal. It&#39;s kind of round trip. It shot up to 90. Everyone&#39;s like, &quot;Woo, we&#39;re up 50%.&quot; Now it&#39;s back down in the 60s. They&#39;re generating recordfree cash flow. 7.5 billion. They&#39;ll probably do 7.5 8 billion. They&#39;re going to buy back 20% of the company in the next 2 years. Alex Chris came from into it. He ran 50% of the revenues. He had a 30 bagger while he was uh running the small business division there. He&#39;s going to do the same things for PayPal. PayPal&#39;s down because EU said, &quot;Oh, you&#39;re going to tariff us. We&#39;re going to tariff your processors.&quot; And people shoot first, ask\n### FEATURED_COMPANY_DEEP_DIVES\n\n### MEDIA_APPEARANCE_RECAP\nwe&#39;re just shooting in the wind. So we are probably down still about, let&#39;s say, 14% roughly on the S&P 500 from a recent high. Do you think it is rangebound until we get a little bit more certainty? Yeah, we have two frameworks. One would be Trump tariff war 1.0. In 2018, you had a 20% correction. Yes. And then you were at new highs four months later. That&#39;s a possibility. We would love that. Uh the second scenario that we&#39;re looking at is the 2011 European debt crisis. 20% correction and then 3 months of hell, choppy volatility. Even though the bottom was kind of in marginal new lows, it was literally up and down every day for three months of uncertainty until Mario Draghy came out and said, &quot;We&#39;ll do whatever it takes.&quot; So, we need one of those moments. So either way, but even in that case, eight months later, we were at new highs. So I learned early in the business, Kristen, good things happen to people who buy highquality businesses when they&#39;re marked down. And I think this time will be no different. What are some of the high quality names, Thomas, that are on your radar? Yeah, I think number one, don&#39;t give up on PayPal. Everyone is down on PayPal. It&#39;s kind of round trip. It shot up to 90. Everyone&#39;s like, &quot;Woo, we&#39;re up 50%.&quot; Now it&#39;s back down in the 60s. They&#39;re generating recordfree cash flow. 7.5 billion. They&#39;ll probably do 7.5 8 billion. They&#39;re going to buy back 20% of the company in the next 2 years. Alex Chris came from into it. He ran 50% of the revenues. He had a 30 bagger while he was uh running the small business division there. He&#39;s going to do the same things for PayPal. PayPal&#39;s down because EU said, &quot;Oh, you&#39;re going to tariff us. We&#39;re going to tariff your processors.&quot; And people shoot first, ask questions  later. The fact of the matter is the deal is going to be very simple with the EU. You take our LNG, we&#39;ll lower your tariffs. They won&#39;t tariff our processors. All will be well. Alex Chris is going to run this up up the flag pole. You see Will Ferrell on the TV commercials. They&#39;re rocking and rolling. They&#39;ve got 430 million active users. This is a huge business. Every time you take an Uber, that&#39;s actually PayPal. You don&#39;t even know it. It&#39;s called Brainree. Interesting. Yeah. Uh another energy company I know has been on your radar for a while as well. What&#39;s the latest on that? Yeah. So, Comtock Resources, uh it&#39;s it&#39;s a double since we started talking about it. Uh that&#39;s over a year ago. We think it can double again. And here&#39;s why. 8 billion enterprise value. The proved reserves PV10 that they have to report to the SEC 10 years of drilling is worth about 78 billion. So that&#39;s good. Um there the unproved reserves which they don&#39;t have to report is about 15 years of drilling. We estimate that&#39;s worth about $10 billion. Uh so we think it can double one more time from here. And it&#39;s perfectly in line with the Trump administration initiatives of drill baby drill, massive energy, powering the data centers, and now of course servicing Europe. Yeah. I do want to ask Thomas the lessons from 2018. I think there are real",
    "MISCELLANEOUS": "\n\nquestions , and of course asking questions  to some of our guests. Tom, great to have you in. for having me. Happy to be here. So, we were just talking about how you do a great job of getting\n\n### MISCELLANEOUS\nthat stuff hit the tape and this this bottom in the markets could be durable. Let&#39;s see how it comes in coming days and coming weeks. Let&#39;s certainly see it is fascinating. I&#39;ve spoken with sources before who&#39;ve told me that these consoles, these video game players, they there&#39;s not like an off-brand version. So, they do have a lot of that pricing power. Are you shifting your allocation to XUS or you haven&#39;t made that decision as a as a firm yet? We haven&#39;t made this decision yet. I will not like talk about specific portfolio allocation here, but is there is\n\nthe lessons of Trump 1.0 and and 2018 are uh excess volatility followed by resolution to the upside. That&#39;s the way he rolls. So, he throws out these grenades and everyone ducks for cover and then when he realizes there&#39;s enough pain, he goes in and he fixes the problem. And I think what you&#39;re going to see is as you see one, two, three tape bombs, look, you&#39;re going to wake up one morning, everyone&#39;s pessimistic, and you&#39;re going to see a beautiful truth or tweet, whatever he wants to call it, it&#39;s going to say, &quot;I just got off the phone with my good friend Xihinping, and the market&#39;s up 5,000 points, and you&#39;re you&#39;re stuck, you know, in cash, and you say, &quot;I missed it.&quot; So, I think it&#39;s selective buying. It&#39;s not wholesale buying. It could take longer than we expect. Deal with the volatility as it relates to supply chains. We just need to see one deal hit the tape and then they can get a little more comfort. There&#39;s some rationality. We can slowly move ahead, but yes, people are slightly on pause and that will have an impact in economic numbers in the first couple of quarters for sure. \n### MISCELLANEOUS\nAnd if that&#39;s the case and they do announce something like that, in my view, that would probably be the top for gold. Obviously, the bottom in the market. Um, so just something to consider. Not really something you can act on because it&#39;s not done, okay? And nothing gets done until one man says it gets done, apparently. So, um, but it would make sense why they wouldn&#39;t at least announce one or two deals, um, when they&#39;ve got so many countries coming together. And if that is the case, that is a great thing. I&#39;d be a little surprised if it was as soon as this weekend. It seems like an awful lot to get done in a short period of time, but I&#39;d be open to it, let me tell you that. And uh and for all the clients that are in, by the way, congratulations to everyone who came in. Congratulations to all the new clients. We we named a bunch of them last week, all the existing clients who put money in in when it was down the most last uh Tuesday and Monday after we did our special private client call. Um and uh and new clients that came in over the transom uh in time for our closing on Saturday. So, super job and uh that&#39;s kind of the good news. You can probably leave it there and go watch football games now and uh color Easter eggs for your kids. But uh let&#39;s let&#39;s go back to the S&amp;P 500 because again, when fundamentals are thrown out the window, you have to look a little bit at technicals. And um let&#39;s take a look. If you recall, we talked about a quote unquote double bottom. I had to walk my friend off the ledge the other week. Um and uh and quite a few others, by the way. Uh but that&#39;s okay. You know, that&#39;s that&#39;s what bottoms look like. And uh even the best have have reason to get scared because it&#39;s man-made. You can&#39;t handicap it. It&#39;s not years of build up and then you can say, &quot;Oh, okay. It&#39;ll take, you know, 24 months and we&#39;ll be back at new highs.&quot; So, when it&#39;s man-made, a tweet creates it. A tweet can solve it. And or an accord or a grand package overnight. And if you&#39;re caught flatfooted in cash or whatever, you just you can never get it back because you wake up and it&#39;s too late. So, um, so this double bottom is still holding. I think last week we were kind of here and everyone was despondent. Then we started to rise. People got a little happier. Yesterday, pulled back, but in the scheme of things, didn&#39;t really pull that much. This is still holding for now. Everyone is looking for the retest. Maybe we get it, maybe we don&#39;t. If we get that if we get that package over the weekend again, probably a coin flip, maybe a little more than a coin flip, then we&#39;re there&#39;s no way we&#39;re going back here. If we don&#39;t get it, uh, that wouldn&#39;t surprise me. And it could be the 2011 scenario we discussed, three months of hell, chop, most of the pain&#39;s in, but you just like just wait killing time for three months until they get their act together. Um, or if we get this weekend, it could blow at 2018 back at new highs within 4 months, which would be unbelievably exciting. Uh, so I&#39;m just trying to throw this perspective out. Uh, literally, by the way, off the plane late last night, super early out here in California. So, if I sound like I&#39;m on a lot of caffeine, um, you&#39;re perceptive. Let&#39;s just leave it at that. Put call Trin by the way taking the girls and Caitlyn and I are taking the girls to Hawaii on Friday tomorrow for a week. So we&#39;ll do it how I like to. I&#39;m going to play a lot of incredible courses. Uh half day work, half day play. Girls have been wanting to go to Hawaii forever. And apparently on the West Coast, Hawaii is the Caribbean. Uh as we relate to it on the east coast, I guess Cabo and and Hawaii are the Caribbean like we have on the east coast. So very excited to show them that. Haven&#39;t been there. Caitlyn and I were there before we got married. So my goodness, 17 18 years ago. That&#39;s uh time flies. Uh certainly when you&#39;re having fun and uh give Caitlyn credit that uh we we have had a lot of fun together and uh we&#39;ll we&#39;ll have another week of great memories with the kids. All right, skew. Uh that&#39;s down. This is you know these are when skew is washed out you know that these are the times when you need to worry when skews elevated and and we were noting that I you know this this this was this was likely okay and we talked about that buckle up buttercup February March blah blah blah this 10% move was likely this overshoot has been unlikely, but I think it&#39;s going to get resolved relatively quickly, like 2018. So, uh, we were kind of fine to ride or die. This this was unnecessary, to be honest. But all things considered, it&#39;s like sending Xi the Christmas card, even though he doesn&#39;t celebrate Christmas, is is going to be sending Trump because we put literally record amounts of money to work last week. Even more than we put to to work in October 2022. And I said last week, if you&#39;re on the fence, you need to come in because, you know, number one, I&#39;ve never asked anyone to invest. I&#39;ve always just put out value and and good people find me after they see the framework, make some some money with my ideas or their referrals from existing clients. Um, but there were two times in my career that I told people, now&#39;s the time if you&#39;re on the fence, either put more money to work or to come in fresh. One was October 2022 and uh one was last week uh and and in this range right now. So, um so there&#39;s that. Let&#39;s see how it plays out. Uh I know how it plays out the long term. How does it play out in the next few days or few weeks or few months? Uh we covered the different scenarios last week. You can see some great companies on sale. You know, Chevron getting knocked down. That&#39;s probably getting interesting. Nike, same story. Disney, um Intel, you know, all this stuff. Once you get an announcement, the whole framework of investor thinking is going to change and it&#39;s going to change super super fast. Um, so just enjoy the buy 1 get one free sales and one day you wake up, I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s Monday or five Mondays from now or 12 Mondays from now, but um, you know, the Intel&#39;s I mean this is these are the environments that I absolutely live for. Okay. So, want to thank we I think I&#39;ve got the\n\nYou can see some great companies on sale. You know, Chevron getting knocked down. That&#39;s probably getting interesting. Nike, same story. Disney, um Intel, you know, all this stuff. Once you get an announcement, the whole framework of investor thinking is going to change and it&#39;s going to change super super fast. ### MISCELLANEOUS\nSo, want to thank we I think I&#39;ve got the\n\nvaluation discounts of small caps relative to midcap I mean the these you haven&#39;t had this opportunity since 2020 2001 which we keep going back to and uh that was a record you know the next five six years record out performance for small cap so ignore at your own underperformance peril S&P stock uh performance in 2025. So obviously defensive have have done well. If you back this up a month, this would look entirely different. Cuts like a knife. Net revision momentum for stocks. 12 month forward earnings per share. Obviously, everyone&#39;s downgrading uh estimates in the hole. Just like you saw Goldman Sachs on Monday, they put out a recession call uh at 100 p.m. And then at uh 1:30, Trump tweeted, \"We&#39;re going to do an exemption for the electronics.\" And then 2:00 they said, \"Did we say recession? We were, you know, if you can&#39;t take a joke.\" And then two days later they said, \"Well, yeah, I know. We took back our recession call. Now we&#39;re going to have a recession.\" I mean, these guys are clowns. Clowns without a circus. And uh it I I sympathize with them because it&#39;s it&#39;s not easy to make decisions when the earth keeps shifting underneath you and the rules of the game are unknown. So, uh, I definitely empathize with them, but you got to be less reactive and you got to look at, you know, Charlie Mer, big fan of and student of Charlie Mer is if you understand incentives, you can get a good sense of outcome. And you know, if you look at what are Trump&#39;s incentives, what are G&#39;s incentives, what is the world&#39;s incentives, eventually you know where this is going. The question is, do you know what you own so you can hold on long enough to get the benefits of where any rational thinker would know this is headed? And if you get there, then you use these opportunities uh to be better positioned than everyone else when it finally  occurs, which is what we&#39;ve done. If you don&#39;t know what you own and you just trade on price and momentum and what the crowd does and you&#39;re a sheep, sheep get slaughtered and uh that&#39;s what happens. you sell in the hole thinking you&#39;re going to be cute and buy lower and you think you&#39;re going to be able to time everything and those people just get destroyed. They get carried out on stretchers and then the thing is back at new highs and they&#39;re not benefiting and they&#39;re permanently impaired forever. Um so that&#39;s what we try to help you avoid each week with hedge fund tips with Tom Hayes. uh and um okay so a lot of people are feeling pain both the 6040 portfolio hasn&#39;t worked uh because of that malfunctioning it will work over time you&#39;ve always had periods like this where that happens eventually it re recovers uh bare market lows and forward return so you can see here average 12-month out 45.8 8 off the low. Top 10 airport signs of weakness in arrivals. This is uh people coming into the US. So, we&#39;re kind of hurting oursel that way. China&#39;s GDP growth beats expectations for the first quarter of 2025. Like to hear that as an owner of Baba. Retail sales boosted by government subsidies in China. The game is on, ladies and gentlemen. Money goes where it&#39;s treated best. And the West is in austerity. West meaning the US right now is in austerity. The east is in stimulus and uh and that&#39;s where equities are going to do the best. Foreigners own 33% of the US Treasury market. So good luck on uh overplaying your hand in negotiations with that. Market expectations for Fed funds rate keep coming down. Retail sales change. What was the biggest one? Uh this was in March, ladies and gentlemen. Motor motor vehicles and parts. Cooper Standard Advanced Auto Parts number one over five% retail sales growth. US retail sales diffusion index positioning across sector groups. Uh healthc care positioning. This is going to be a buy. By the way, uh soft data diverging from hard data. This is what I said. The difference between people what they say they&#39;re doing and what they&#39;re actually doing. What they&#39;re say doing is the world is coming to the end. what they&#39;re actually doing is buying stuff. Uh, oh, it&#39;s going to be a great depression. I got to go get a car before tariffs come in. Uh, you can&#39;t still can&#39;t get a restaurant at a a reservation without a week notice in Orange County. I mean, it&#39;s it&#39;s mindboggling. Atlanta Fed GDP now estimate um, negative. Okay, so that&#39; be one quarter up to Trump if it&#39;s going to be two quarters and get an actual recession. I doubt it. Uh, Prime Book, consumer staples interest over time. This is interesting. Taow. Look at this. Google search has gone from flatline to off the charts in the past month. T\n\nEven with the 100% tariffs, you&#39;ll pay $20 versus $120. I mean, if Trump plays his hand too long, this could lead to a lot of branded companies going out of business. I mean, LDMH, they had fake purses, 30 $40,000 purses for $2,000. Warren Buffett, someone&#39;s sitting in the shade today because someone planted a tree a long time ago. And those of you who planted your trees in 2022 and 2023 and and today uh when we look a year, two years, three years out, you&#39;re going to be sitting in this in the shade smiling so wide you could eat a watermelon sideways. Uh and you&#39;ll look back and say, \"Yeah, I had some white knuckles. Boy, that was an uncertain time.\" But I knew the businesses we own, they&#39;d come out stronger. Even in the worst case scenario, you know, we&#39;re not buying a bodega on the corner that if Trump throws us into a recession is going to shutter and be taken over by a new owner. We are buying the biggest public companies that have brand ownership in their spaces. So, if it got bad, all their competition, their smaller competition that are non-public, etc., uh, are going to go out of business and they&#39;re just going to pick up share. So, either way, they win. If we don&#39;t go into a recession, they&#39;re already the best, so they&#39;re going to rebound the fastest. If we do go into a recession, they&#39;re going to win over a longer term because they&#39;re going to buy up all the people that went out of business, uh, or gain share, one or the other. Okay, so here&#39;s\n\n### MISCELLANEOUS\nSloomer\n\n### TECHNICAL_CHARTS\nUh, you know, looks like we&#39;re at support here on the S&amp;P. Uh, here&#39;s our, uh, year one of the election cycle. Tends to be terrible into the 13th week. That&#39;s why we&#39;re talking to you in early February. Bullet VIX index again got up to 60 and change. If you&#39;re not a buyer when the VIX is 60, I don&#39;t know what to tell you. equal weight uh Russell 2000 again MCI Europe bouncing. So this all looks okay. DAX, I wouldn&#39;t be a buyer of the DAX. Uh Tokyo Stock Exchange bounced off the lows. Hang Sang, same thing. Dollar index getting close to the bottom of the range. If they deval, I mean, it could go down to 88, which would be pretty awesome for emerging markets in China. Uh, DXY, it&#39;s right here at support. Canadian dollar, all the looney skeptics, look what&#39;s happening. Euro, and you&#39;ll be sending Trump a Christmas card. USD, Chinese, yuan. Oil looks like it&#39;s bottoming out here. Gold looks like it might be peaking here. Copper. Copper is uh has a PhD in economics. Apple bounced and rolled over. Baba bounce to support now rising. It takes out 120.

Trump pushes trade partners to buy more US energy as a way to avoid higher tariffs.\n### MISCELLANEOUS\nDon&#39;t fight the data.\n\nthe rumors, not the noise. What are the actual facts? And here they are. US ADRs are held by US investors, not the Chinese government or Chinese investors. Over $800 billion of US investor capital sits in 286 China ADRs. Dellisting China ADRs would do nothing but vaporize nearly a trillion dollars of US and cap US investor capital, including pension funds for teachers, firemen, police officers, uh etc. um union workers, okay, uh manufacturing people on the assembly line, uh all while the Chinese government laughs all the way to the bank. You basically just took the gun out and shot yourself and took a trillion dollars out of your firepower. Uh two, on the flip side, China old holds $1.3 trillion worth of US treasuries and about $370 billion worth of US equities. They could easily liquidate these in re retaliation. If lowering the 10-year yield is this administration&#39;s top priority. It&#39;s hard to believe they would cross the line, this line, and open the door for such retaliation. It&#39;s natural to make threats when you, you know, when you&#39;re negotiating to get what you want, but doing so would be the equivalent of shooting yourself in the foot on the world stage. And three, the US has the number one capital markets in the world because rumors like this don&#39;t happen. foreign companies, whether from China or elsewhere, pay enormous fees to list in the United States and go through all the regulatory hurdles in vetting. Weaponizing delisting for political purposes wouldn&#39;t exactly encourage foreign companies to IPO or list here in the future, and it would undermine the strength of American capital markets. Basically, you just push tens of billions of dollars of business to London and to Hong Kong. So, uh maybe that&#39;s another reason to be ex US equities uh and looking at opportunities in UK and Hong Kong. Now, if fears over D-listing are keeping you up at night, Baba shareholders can easily convert their US ADS&#39;s to Hong Kong listed shares.\n\nA step-by-step guide directly from Alibaba is listed below. Again, we see this as an unlikely scenario and a hard line is in the sand. What really matters is that you focus on what you can control. And when you buy high quality businesses, when they&#39;re marked down, good good things tend to follow. Alibaba is no different. So what we are doing, it it it&#39;s it&#39;s really funny. Literally a month ago, I was going to call our custodian and have all of our Hong Kong shares convert that we converted during this first fear converted back to Baba ADS&#39;s. And I was like, let&#39;s just hold off. So now I&#39;m going to make the call. Uh I have made the call. I&#39; I put it in two days ago. uh we&#39;re going to convert all of our USADS shares to Hong Kong. Not because we think anything&#39;s really going to happen, but we want to hedge against it. Um but we are keeping 100% of our US ADS derivatives because we really can&#39;t replicate the upside in those in any other instrument and we can&#39;t replicate them in Hong Kong. So where we come out is as a fiduciary we want to hedge our downside. If a nuclear option happens and it was some executive order delisting our options are probably wiped but because we own the shares in Hong Kong over time the equities on that theme China XUS will dramatically more than make up for getting wiped on the derivatives. Uh, so we have to hedge it so we can keep the derivatives. If I if I had to assign a probability of a of a highly stupid decision, I&#39;d put it at like 7 to 12%. But by straddling, you know, where most of our money is in the equities and putting that all in Hong Kong. So if we lose on the options, the stock over the next two years is going to make multiple times of that back and multiple times on the invested overall invested capital of both the derivatives and the stock. So that theme and position in the portfolio will do net exceptional even if the worst case scenario occurs. Um, and then if the best case scenario occurs, which is they just leave it alone and let markets do what markets do, uh, we&#39;ll we&#39;ll be at no disadvantage by owning the stocks in Hong Kong and we&#39;ll get the additional kicker benefit from all of our options uh, and derivatives based in the US. So, we&#39;ll get, you know, five bites at the Apple versus two bytes at the Apple. And that&#39;s the best way I could think of it because there&#39;s no other way to express the expected value on that little pocket of derivatives than the way we have it set up. And we want to ride that and we think that um the odds are in our favor, but we&#39;re hedging it out in if they&#39;re not and the nuclear option comes, we are prepared for it. we have the stock to to ride uh prospectively in Hong Kong and uh and it will more than make up for the the the loss in uh the USDS uh issue which again we assign a very low probability. So if I&#39;ve got a 10% probability I&#39;m not going to give up a 5 to 7 5 to 7x expected value over the next 12 to 24 months. I&#39;m just not going to do it. Especially when the percentage of the overall assets is small but the upside is so big. And that&#39;s how we&#39;re just managing it as fiduciaries in that pocket of our portfolio that&#39;s dedicated to China to just hedge against any very small outside risk but not nothing risk and that&#39;s all we can do. So the earth shifts underneath us every single day. Uh it doesn&#39;t change the underlying business. the underlying business is only going to get better regardless of the outcome. But how do we ensure that we&#39;re in a position to guarantee take advantage of it and more likely than not take advantage of it in every single way possible under the sun and that&#39;s really what we want to do and that&#39;s what we are going to do. So that&#39;s how we&#39;re dealing with it. You do what you do. I mean, I rode out PCAOB with a ton of US ads and uh and really didn&#39;t blink because I knew if if there was a legal respect and framework that ultimately it wouldn&#39;t be delisted and that&#39;s exactly what happened. uh I have to be open to the dimminimous possibility that a legal framework is not respected and that&#39;s why we&#39;ve taken action and made the request two days ago uh and uh should be executed uh shortly. So, um, and my guess is at these levels, I mean, we we bought plenty of BABA last week, by the way. That&#39;ll become 9988, uh, probably tonight or tomorrow, and we look forward to buying more. So, nothing in our thesis has changed. Where we hold the bulk of our money that&#39;s committed to the idea, i.e. in the stock, uh, is going to change just just as a hedge. Uh and because the odds are 90% in our favor that the nuclear option will not be triggered, uh we do nothing with this small piece of our overall assets that has a monstrous upside expected value of, you know, 5x plus uh and we&#39;re going to just ride ride or die on that small piece. And that&#39;s what we always do in the derivative bucket anyway. So uh super excited about that. Fear and greed down here. Buyer not seller. National Association of Active Investment Managers turning up. So that&#39;s good from very low levels. ADR dlisting risk back in focus. This is from Goldman Sachs. I think John sent this. Um I think they go through all the history basically assigning a low probability. Uh here are some of the things that would happen. Following summarizes a simplified procedure for dellisting from an investor&#39;s perspective based on historical precedence. Investors sell before the last day of the ADR trading after 10 days of the filing of form 25 with the SEC. Investors will be able to freely trade and sell the soontobe delisted stock on US exchanges at prevailing market price before the securities last trading day in the US. B. Investors could continue to trade the shares on the OTC market subject to their mandate and investment scope. For instance, Luck and Coffee, LKNCY, was delisted from the NASDAQ on June 29, 2020, but its shares are still trading on the over-the-counter market. Um, so that is um I think BABA has an over-the-counter uh version also called BABAF uh which trades in line with the underlying ADS and with the Hong Kong share prices anyway. And any difference will be arbed out. So you don&#39;t really have to worry about where it&#39;s traded and getting a huge discount because if there&#39;s a huge discount, someone will arb that out over time. Uh C, investors can trade on other exchanges as the stock is listed on a major other exchange and can return their ADS and um withdraw the equivalent deposited security i.e. Hong Kong shares uh based on previous cases even after the effective D-listing date. So you don&#39;t have to do this now at all. Uh and D investors p receive the net proceeds upon the termination of the ADR program. Investors take no action uh before and 6 months after. Oh, listen to this. If investors take no action before and 6 months after the D-listing date, the depository will commence the sale of ordinary shares represented by unreturned ADRs at prevailing market price if listed elsewhere. So you&#39;ll basically get the Hong Kong price in cash and pay the net cash proceeds after applicable fees and expenses to the ADR shareholders. So basically, if you do nothing and it stops trading, what this is saying from go Gold Goldman Sachs is it&#39;ll just send you your money at the Hong Kong price. Um, but we don&#39;t want cash, we want appreciation. Uh, and this is just getting started. So, you know, reading this, my inclination is to again do nothing, but uh, as a fiduciary, my inclination is to hedge that risk.

So, those would probably just be cashed out and he would reinvest those in Hong Kong shares. So, I think uh it&#39;s perfectly fine to be in Kb as far as I understand.

So that&#39;s not a good ratio to have 100 million in cash and six billion in debt in this environment or any environment. So for me, I mean, they&#39;re generating a lot of cash.

I really have no interest in. Um, I hope it works for Bill and um and it probably will. He&#39;s buying it with enough margin of safety, but um it&#39;s not a business I want to own long term. Um Starbucks SBUX is obviously down on the China. They might have to sell the Chinese b business. There&#39;s not enough margin of safety for me here. So, yeah, it&#39;s a good business and everything else. And I wouldn&#39;t bet against the Chipotle guy. He&#39;s going to figure it out. But, you know, talk to me if it gets down. Well, it&#39;s at 80. I was going to say talk to me if it gets below 100. It&#39;s at 80. All right. Uh, let&#39;s see. Yeah, I think for the long term, you&#39;re okay betting on this guy and this business. Uh, but I think you also might have an opportunity to get it a little cheaper. There&#39;s a lot of competition. Dutch Bros, everything else. I I would just I mean to say I&#39;d buy it at 70 or 75 and I wouldn&#39;t buy it at 8085 is pretty silly if it&#39;s a longterm thing, but that&#39;s kind of where I come out. Um, all right. Next, Matt Mitchell LVMH. I got to say, uh, yeah, I do want to buy these, but after seeing those China manufacturing videos on Tik Tok, gives me a little pause because kind of the the gig is up. I I I would I would wait on this. I I I understand like backward looking it&#39;s a complete no-brainer at these levels based on the fundamentals, but I would just probably step aside. Jason Moore, my son and I listen to your podcast each week. Thanks for all you do. AES, thank you for watching. AES, I mean, you got a utility. What&#39;s the dividend yield? Pretty sure that&#39;s a utility. 7% yield. Yeah, I guess you just got to look at their cap table, but I mean their capital structure for debt refinance, but I generally think you&#39;re okay with that 7% yield. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Let me rephrase that. What the hell is going on here? I I would just avoid this. This This is crazy for a utility. Where are these guys? is based in Virginia. All right. If you can get unshakable confidence that this negative free cash flow is over, maybe. But this is this is no bueno. So for I I wouldn&#39;t even waste time on it. Um there&#39;s not enough upside to take that kind of risk. If the if the upside, you know, if this thing could be a 10 bagger once they get it to cash flow positive or five bagger, yes. But like to make 50% and collect a 7% yield for possible existential risk, hell no. Chris Williamson, MU looks interesting here. Getting close to the bottom of the cycle. Okay, then buy it. I don&#39;t I don&#39;t know if that&#39;s a question or an or what, but um I&#39;m I&#39;m not a fan of MU. That&#39;s been a You might be right. I I just It&#39;s such a sick I I&#39;ll tell you what&#39;s what what&#39;s not going to happen is you&#39;re not going to get a triple or quadruple. And in Intel, if they do it half right, that&#39;s what&#39;s going to happen. So why would I screw around with this? Manique, is Charles Payne short or are you should have been in the NBA? How tall are you? Number one, Charles Payne is not short. Uh he&#39;s uh he&#39;s tall, tall, handsome guy. Uh two, I&#39;m 6&#39;5. And three, I think it&#39;s camera angle because like I said in his old studio, they did not look like there was that much stuff, but uh it is what it is. Brian Norman, what are your thoughts on Trump administration considering D-listing we just covered? Delete. Nicholas Wang with depressed car volumes now for 20. What are you talking about? What numbers are you looking at? We had record numbers in the month of March. So, burden yourself with the facts. Thank you for the question and thank you for tuning in. Must be in the blue line category where he thinks inflation is going to be 8%. Uh, Mr. Hayes. Okay. So, he&#39;s got a question on Matt Hollerin, longtime supporter, wants to do floor and decor, which we did on the podcast a few weeks ago, and I think we said fine. It&#39;s a home building play, home building recovery play, and yes, we do like it. Good work. Ah, let me just take a look here. I think you&#39;re a little early, buddy, but you&#39;re close. So, if you&#39;re thinking three years out, you could buy it here. If you&#39;re thinking longer, I just wait a little bit. What&#39;s the debt like? Yeah, they&#39;re fine there. So, so yeah, I think you&#39;re okay. I think you can probably get a little better price. I mean, if you get low 60s, you&#39;re probably I think you&#39;re okay here. Uh, good work. [Music] Uh next is from from thanks for your Carl Johnson. What would you say are the top three or four stocks in your portfolio biggest upside potential? I think you just equal weight 10 good ideas. Um, obviously we like Baba, obviously we like Cooper Standard, uh, but they&#39;re they&#39;re all this tariff thing created such amazing opportunities and my clients know which ones are our favorite based on the waiting in their portfolio and I&#39;ll leave that benefit to them. But for listening in, if you like some of the names, just equal weight them because you&#39;re never going to predict which ones go first. Some are going to double in less than a year and some are going to take three or four years. But if you&#39;ve got a basket of them, you&#39;re going to do great. Um, all right. Got that one. AJ Barley Cooper standard has a billion dollars in debt in three years. Market&#39;s currently pricing blah blah blah. Yeah. So, listen to the uh interview that I did with him. Welcome to the podcast. You&#39;re obviously new. Um, we did 38 minutes on we did a one-hour interview. Go to hedge fund tips at the YouTube channel. We discussed all of this. All right, next. Griffin Griffin Brown says, &quot;Typically listen podcast on our way to work. Recently started watching the podcast and it&#39;s much more beneficial.&quot; It&#39;s like three three times more valuable to be able to see it versus listen to it. But if all you can do is listen to it, I&#39;m glad to deliver that value as well. Uh do you typically use Koifin for your valuations and ratios or do you like to do them yourself using numbers from the 10K? Always go to source numbers if we&#39;re going to put um this is just for screening and a quick look to see if we should do real work, but no, everything comes from the public filings and we double and triple check everything. Um, GTN. That&#39;s from Keenan Martins. GTN. Great television. All right. I know the guy who runs this, he also has an insurance company I wanted to get involved in. [Music] Um, I understand what you&#39;re saying. You&#39;re generally right, but there are factors that you don&#39;t know that you don&#39;t know. So, uh, for me, it&#39;s a pass. Uh, Tom, you&#39;re the bacon bringinger. Okay, so this is about the CEO of Intel having Chinese investments through his fund coming under scrutiny. Look, the guy is Chinese. He was vetted by the board of directors. If he has to unwind some of his Chinese investments that his fund is in, he&#39;ll unwind some of his Chinese investments. He was on the board, he had the same investments. That that was just noise last week. Uh, and that&#39;s it. So,",

Part of the negotiations with the EU are going to be about we&#39;ll lower your tariffs. You&#39;re going to take all of our LNG. Uh Jerry Jones owns 70% of this stock.

We like this here.\n### HEADLINES_AND_NEWS\nBut I I just want to say about the Chinese rejecting Boeing aircraft is like a diabetic rejecting insulin. They need our planes more more than we need their sales. That&#39;s for sure. I think look in the kingdom of the blind, the oneeyed man is king, okay? The countries that come to the table first and sign the deals first are going to have certainty.\n\nan enormous premium on certainty for your economy. That&#39;s on the one side. On the other side, Kevin has it was on the network saying, &quot;We&#39;ve got bundles of deals.&quot; Well, the administration needs to take yes for an answer because the minute we take yes for an answer, it shows that we&#39;re ready to do business. We don&#39;t need to have self-inflicted pain. What we need is some certainty with the deals so we can get focused on earnings, growth, and tax cuts. Yeah. If we if we get tax cuts and we get some certainty on tariffs, if we do, you got a market that goes straight up, do we? That&#39;s right. You know what? The market is a discounting mechanism. The minute we see those bundles of deals come across the tape, companies can start to give guidance. Once companies can give guidance, we have some level of certainty and there are a lot of tremendous bargains in the market right now. Money is going to want to go to work as we get a little bit more certainty. All right, Tom, thanks very much for analyzing the market this morning. We appreciate it. Thanks for having me. \n### MEDIA_APPEARANCE_RECAP\nSo we had a lot of volatility last week. This feels like a little bit more normaly now or at least trying to kind of figure out how do we get back to normal. Um you pointed out that this is the first correction where seasoned pros seem more fearful than retail investors. Um I&#39;m surprised to hear that. But how did you arrive at that assessment? Yeah, well incoming phone calls. I mean, I have peers in the business that were calling me in literally abject fear and me kind of walking them off the ledge and saying, &quot;This too shall pass.&quot; You know, if you look at the data, uh, retail investors have actually been buying in the hole on this correction and hedge funds have had record selling in the hole. And what&#39;s interesting about that, most people say, &quot;Well, the dumb money smart money.&quot; Let me tell you something. The retail investors have been right since co they have been buying weakness while professionals have been selling weakness and the retail investors have been correct and I think this is going to be the case again. But was some of that fear warranted? I&#39;m not saying one should feed into fear but like when we saw that volatility last week obviously we&#39;ve cooled since then on volatility when we look at the VIX it&#39;s not at those historic levels that we saw. Um, but you know, when you&#39;re in this daily, you&#39;ve experienced that turbulence before, it does kind of trigger it triggers a a memory that wasn&#39;t great. That&#39;s right. That&#39;s right. Look, the the administration has to learn to take yes for an answer. Okay. They have deals on the table or as Kevin Hasset would say bundles of deals on the table and all they need what you need to see is one credible deal roll across the tape and then the market will realize there&#39;s some rationality in the administration. They&#39;re going to move ahead. Things are going to be okay. Uh we&#39;re just in the period of uncertainty and the way that you get through that is you focus on what you can control and all you can control is buying high quality businesses when they&#39;re on sale. I learned very early in the business, good things happen to people who buy highquality assets when they&#39;re marked down. And you know, irrespective of how long it takes to get a deal, if it takes So here&#39;s two two analoges. Trump 1.0 in 2018, trade war market corrected 20%. It recovered Vshape within 4 months to new highs. Could that happen? That&#39;s a possibility. We&#39;re slightly more in the camp. It&#39;s going to be like the 2011 European debt cris where you had a 20% correction and then three months of hell non-stop volatility and then 8 months later you were at new highs. Really quickly, I know you&#39;ve got a couple of uh picks, but I want to ask you that point about volatility. Although we&#39;re not at that level that we saw last week, which reminded people included of the uh GFC. Um, is volatility here to stay or at least during this presidential term? Yeah. Uh, well, the the history of President Trump is volatility followed by upside resolution. And that&#39;s his formula. He knows how to push it to the edge and then break through and the market resolves higher. So, I think you just have to on a company by company basis buy quality that you don&#39;t have to worry about, not speculative stocks. and we&#39;re going to find we wake up one morning and he says, &quot;I just spoke to my good friend Xihinping and the market&#39;s up 5,000 points.&quot; He does call his good friend. I mean, it&#39;s an interesting characterization there. But, okay, let&#39;s talk about your picks. Um, especially given your views on how you want to buy things, where you see opportunity, potential sale. CRK is on your list. Comtock Resources. Now, you picked this a year ago or a little more than a year ago, right? It&#39;s been a winner since then, up more than 100%. Um, why are you still bullish? Where do you see it going? I think part of the tariff negotiations is particularly with Europe is going to be you want a reduction in tariffs. You need to take all of our LNG. Okay. They need our LG. We have it in abundance. They need to take it. And they&#39;re going to want to do that deal. Uh, Comtock Resources, 70% owned by Jerry Jones, who owns the Cowboys. uh the proved reserves that they report to the SEC which is 10 years of drilling are worth about uh $8 billion. The enterprise value is around $8 billion. However, their unproved reserves which they do not report uh is another 15 years of drilling. Okay. So, we think that&#39;s worth um about $10 billion which means we think not only it doubled since we talked about it, we think it can double one more time over the next 12 to 24 months. Is there still a push for LG given the Trump administration&#39;s uh not the same focus on converting to more um I&#39;m finding I&#39;m trying to find the word how you care I mean it&#39;s considered a better better for the environment. Uh that&#39;s a good question. You mean he&#39;d prefer coal? Well you look you can&#39;t make it up. Well, I think he wants everything and we&#39;re going to need everything to power the data centers, to power the increased demand, whether it&#39;s EVs, whether it&#39;s data centers, uh, unlimited demand and globally unlimited demand. So, that&#39;s a great way to play it. Okay, your next ticker, QXO. Now, look, that&#39;s a different pick than this in terms of its performance. Uh, I mean, with Comtock Resources, that&#39;s outperformed the S&amp;P 500 uh this day. But QXO, this seems like a little bit of a Where does it go? Yeah, this is a relatively new position for us. This is Brad Jacobs. Brad Jacobs is a winner. He makes money for shareholders. If you had invested a million bucks with him when he started United Rentals in 1997 when he got involved, you&#39;re up 70 some odd, 74x, $74 million. If you did XPO logistics in 2009, he came in, he put 150 million bucks of his own money, bought stock, you&#39;re up 160%, 1 million became 160 million. Now he&#39;s doing a roll up. Same formula, different industry in building products. You got 75 million millennials, 34. They want to buy houses. They can&#39;t afford them. So Besson&#39;s going to deregulate banks, bring down Treasury yields below uh 4%. Okay? Hopefully the good way. Not through not through a recession, but the good way. Uh that will make housing affordable. And Trump is opening, you know, we got 500 million acres of federal land. He&#39;s opening that up to build all these starter homes. So KB Homes will build your starter home. You get an endangered elk free of charge in your backyard. And Brad Jacobs is going to provide all of the building supplies. He&#39;s going to do a rollup. He&#39;s going to add technology. He started with Beacon Roofing Supply. When your roof is leaking, it&#39;s a non-discretionary expense. You don&#39;t think about should we buy a new roof? You have to buy a new roof. I mean, you could patch it, but yeah. Yeah. So, the history of Brad Jacobs is you put money in, you don&#39;t think about it for 5 to 10 years. And this will be 5, six, seven bagger. Uh, at the least, and if history is any prologue, it&#39;ll be a lot more than that. Okay. Potentially a 10 bagger, I think. So, I&#39;d always bet on Brad Jacobs. He is serious. He wrote a book, How to Make a Few Billion. That&#39;s pretty useful because he actually made a few billion dollars. All right. And last, but certainly not least, I really enjoyed this interview with Kristen Scher on NYSE Live. Want to thank Kristen, obviously, and Mel Montana. No relation to Tony Montana from Scarface whatsoever. Mel is fantastic. Mel and uh Kristen are the dream team. We&#39;ll listen in here. Welcome back to NYC TV Live, everyone. I&#39;m Christine Scherer here in studio. Well, stocks are looking at a negative open after what was a muted action yesterday and of course two straight days of gains for the S&amp;P before that. Well, joining me now with more on where we&#39;re headed from here and how investors should respond to all of this is Thomas Hayes. He&#39;s a chair and managing member at Great Hill Capital. Uh Thomas, always great to have you. Great to be here, Kristen. All right, so what do you make of all this market action of late? Uh you want the good news or the bad news? Let&#39;s start with the good news. Okay. Okay. Well, the good news is the same as the bad news, and that&#39;s everyone is pessimistic. Okay. So, you saw the fund manager survey from Bank of America this week. Uh, highest expectations of a recession, fourth highest uh in 20 years. So, we&#39;re talking about 2022, we&#39;re talking about 2020, we&#39;re talking about 2009. Uh, most number of managers wanting to go underweight US equities. So, usually that&#39;s a wash out. And what we&#39;re seeing is the quote unquote dumb money is now the new smart money. Retail investors have been buying a ton of stock on this weakness. Hedge funds have been recordelling in the hole and oddly enough retail investors have been right since co. So let&#39;s talk about what these tariffs mean for companies and and how companies might respond to them. Of course we&#39;re at the beginning of earning season. Thomas, what&#39;s your expectation especially when it comes to guidance? That&#39;s the big deal. I mean the big problem is companies can&#39;t guide in this period of uncertainty and uh Kevin Hasset was was on one of the networks yesterday uh or two days ago now saying we have bundles of deals with amazing terms. Well my message to the administration is how about taking yes for an answer. Uh you saw Vietnam come to the table and they said we&#39;ll do zero tariffs if you do zero tariffs. I understand there&#39;s uh non-tariff barriers, but what the answer should have been was we accept in principle contingent upon working out the non-tariff barriers. Instead, they did not. And what happened? China went to visit Vietnam and they just inked a deal. So, you snooze, you lose. I think the administration has a lot of good things going. They should book one deal and that&#39;s going to give companies more certainty to say, &quot;Hey, here are our three guidance scenarios. If they continue to do deals, good things are going to happen. And if they don&#39;t, medium things are going to happen. And if they really don&#39;t, here are the bad things that could happen. And then the market can kind of get their hands around it. But right now, we&#39;re just shooting in the wind. So we are probably down still about, let&#39;s say, 14% roughly on the S&amp;P 500 from a recent high. Do you think it is rangebound until we get a little bit more certainty? Yeah, we have two frameworks. One would be Trump tariff war 1.0. In 2018, you had a 20% correction. Yes. And then you were at new highs four months later. That&#39;s a possibility. We would love that. Uh the second scenario that we&#39;re looking at is the 2011 European debt crisis. 20% correction and then 3 months of hell, choppy volatility. Even though the bottom was kind of in marginal new lows, it was literally up and down every day for three months of uncertainty until Mario Draghy came out and said, &quot;We&#39;ll do whatever it takes.&quot; So, we need one of those moments. So either way, but even in that case, eight months later, we were at new highs. So I learned early in the business, Kristen, good things happen to people who buy highquality businesses when they&#39;re marked down. And I think this time will be no different. What are some of the high quality names, Thomas, that are on your radar? Yeah, I think number one, don&#39;t give up on PayPal. Everyone is down on PayPal. It&#39;s kind of round trip. It shot up to 90. Everyone&#39;s like, &quot;Woo, we&#39;re up 50%.&quot; Now it&#39;s back down in the 60s. They&#39;re generating recordfree cash flow. 7.5 billion. They&#39;ll probably do 7.5 8 billion. They&#39;re going to buy back 20% of the company in the next 2 years. Alex Chris came from into it. He ran 50% of the revenues. He had a 30 bagger while he was uh running the small business division there. He&#39;s going to do the same things for PayPal. PayPal&#39;s down because EU said, &quot;Oh, you&#39;re going to tariff us. We&#39;re going to tariff your processors.&quot; And people shoot first, ask\n### FEATURED_COMPANY_DEEP_DIVES\n\n### FEATURED_COMPANY_DEEP_DIVES\nThey won't tariff our processors. All will be well. Alex Chris is going to run this up up the flag pole. You see Will Ferrell on the TV commercials. They're rocking and rolling. They've got 430 million active users. This is a huge business. Every time you take an Uber, that's actually PayPal. You don't even know it. It's called Brainree.\n\n### FEATURED_COMPANY_DEEP_DIVES\nSo, Comtock Resources, uh it's it's a double since we started talking about it. Uh that's over a year ago. We think it can double again. And here's why. 8 billion enterprise value. The proved reserves PV10 that they have to report to the SEC 10 years of drilling is worth about 78 billion. So that's good. Um there the unproved reserves which they don't have to report is about 15 years of drilling. We estimate that's worth about $10 billion. Uh so we think it can double one more time from here. And it's perfectly in line with the Trump administration initiatives of drill baby drill, massive energy, powering the data centers, and now of course servicing Europe. Yeah. I do want to ask Thomas the lessons from 2018. I think there are real\n\n### FEATURED_COMPANY_DEEP_DIVES\nThey won't tariff our processors. All will be well.

    "QUOTES_OF_THE_WEEK": "\n\n### MEDIA_APPEARANCE_RECAP\ncoming into earnings, are you comfortable with the valuation 37 times forward? You got a $400 billion enterprise value on 7 billion of free cash flow. You know, that kind of compares to Disney, for instance. They&#39;ve got 8.5 billion of free cash flow and maybe 190 billion enterprise value. Oh, and by the way, you get the parks and you get the experiences and you get the cruise ships for free. um just talk about what that means in terms of exceeding expectations and now that they&#39;re not reporting subscribers and you&#39;ve seen Disney kind of stall at 178 million subscribers and Netflix maybe stall at 300 million subscribers. Uh what are your thoughts on the relative value? I mean it&#39;ll be interesting to see how the fundamentals actually shake out and what we what kind of commentary we actually get from senior management. They&#39;re going to guide the market. they&#39;re going to give us that strategic conviction in terms of whether we believe the Bulls or the Bears. Like whose assumptions do we go with? And in terms of Disney, we can&#39;t forget that they have a substantial amount of their business in the Far East. So they are also exposed. And you know, I think net net it&#39;ll be interesting to see who&#39;s the bumper in this.\n\nfocus on what you can control when the markets marked down like this. What if you focus on buying highquality companies that are marked down? One of the companies we were buying last week aggressively was uh Disney at $85. You don&#39;t have to think hard about Disney. It&#39;s down from $200. Over the next few years, it&#39;s going to recover. Tariffs or no tariffs, it&#39;s going to be okay. Boeing was a company we were adding to. it got down to1 $129 down from $350 some odd dollars. This is a duopoly in in in the aircraft space. So if you buy great companies and you and you have a long-term view 12 to 24 months, you&#39;re going to do great out of this opportunity. To that end, Nvidia was under $100 a couple weeks ago as well. So certainly something to keep in mind.\n\n### QUOTES_OF_THE_WEEK\nI learned early on in the business, good things happen to people who buy highquality companies at low prices. And that&#39;s all you can do right now. On every red day, you look for an opportunity to buy great businesses. You know, last week, Boeing got down to $130 a share. Disney got down to $85 a share. These are down more than 50% from their peaks. These are things you can go to bed, wake up, not even having to worry about. You got two new ideas, Sarxo. I don&#39;t think a lot of folks are familiar with this one. This is Brad Jacobs new rollup. It&#39;s a building supply company. This guy knows how to make money for shareholders. If you had invested $1 million with him and when he did URI, you made $74 million to date. If you had done the same exact thing with QXO in 2009, you made $160 million. So, we&#39;ve got 4 million units housing shortage in the US. Donald Trump has said, &quot;We&#39;re opening up federal lands. Not only do you get your starter home from KB Homes, you get an endangered elk in the backyard free of charge.&quot; They are going to be supplying. They just did beacon roofing supply. They paid 10 times Ibida. He&#39;s going to double that IBIDA with with technology, with tuck in acquisitions. This is one you buy, you tuck away for five to 10 years, and you&#39;re gonna wind up with an eight to10 bagger. And comtock. Comtock we gave on your show January of 2024 around $9. It&#39;s now up double. We think it can double again. Why? Part of the negotiations with the EU are going to be about we&#39;ll lower your tariffs. You&#39;re going to take all of our LNG.

Okay, so here&#39;s\n\nIf a deal&#39;s reached between US and China, we&#39;ll probably see an even bigger push towards domestic consumption in China. And if tariffs stick around, China will have no choice but to shift towards consumption to make up for the hit export-driven GDP growth. Either way, Alibaba will be laughing all the way to the bank. It&#39;s also worth pointing out that China has a pretty powerful toolkit to speed up this shift towards domestic consumption, namely the long-awaited and much rumored bazooka style stimulus. Unlike its Western counterparts, China didn&#39;t pump out stimulus during the p pandemic. So, they have plenty of room to use both monetary and fiscal tools. That&#39;s a luxury US and Europe just don&#39;t have, and the market seems to have recognized and begun to price this in. So you can see here government debt to GDP. In fact, maybe this is why the Chinese government held back on pulling the trigger. Perhaps they saw a potential Trump 2.0 term and a trade war on the horizon. So they decided to hedge their bets and keep some of the ammo in reserve. Either way, they have the tools and more now more than ever. Good reason to use them. It&#39;s over $20 trillion sitting in household deposits waiting to be spent. It&#39;s time to be unleashed the bazooka. Shifting from domestic consumption and stimulus to a less exciting topic. We figured out it would be a good time to address the elephant in the room. something we thought was in the rearview mirror, which is delisting.\n### HEADLINES_AND_NEWS\nRumors began circulating this past week after Fox Business senior correspondent Charles Gasparina published a tweet below. Charles is a fantastic journalist, really good guy. I&#39;ve had dinner with him before. I know him. Um, and he&#39;s just reporting the information that he gets. Um, and then Brendan Ahern put out an article the next day breaking down. Look, there is  a desire. It&#39;s certainly a negotiating chip. I don&#39;t see a deal where China and the US cut a deal and China&#39;s access to US capital markets is removed. I like that is the nuclear option. If if Trump um cuts off their access to US capital markets, I think the trade war turns into a hot war. I&#39;ll just put it that way. Um, but the joke will be on the US because the only people that get hurt if they delist the US ADRs is US investors and pensions. Um, not the Chinese who own it in Hong Kong. So, uh, that would kind of be like if if if you&#39;re China and you&#39;re competing with the US, the best thing that could ever happen to you is they delist your stocks because number one, you just take your business to London and Hong Kong and international money will find you. it goes where it&#39;s treated best. Number two, $800 billion of investor capital of your opponent has been evaporated. And um so, you know, could there be people that stupid in the administration that would move forward with this? Of course. Um so, we&#39;re going to talk about how you hedge against that. Is the likelihood there that there will be no adult in the room to explain to them in English, like to a three-year-old what happens if you actually do this to yourself and you point the gun not at your opponent. It actually has a reverse uh huzzle that points right back at you. Uh we think so. And we know that the the right people are going to go down to Washington and explain this to them because it&#39;s understandable. You would think this is a way to hurt your enemy, but you know, they tried it with semiconductors and it was the worst thing they ever did. Hopefully, they learned from their mistakes. So, Brendan Ahern, good buddy of mine, he runs the KWEB ETF, number one ETF for China internet, uh, put out a great article the next day breaking down the rumors and laying out the facts. He also hosted a tariff briefing webinar that covered, among other things, delisting fears. I highly recommend you listen below. uh talks about we&#39;ve been to this movie before in the last few years. They went through the PCAOB uh etc. Part of it has to do with um Atkins, the new SEC chair, getting votes. You know, he won by 52 votes, so it was a tight vote and some of the people that put him over the top would like to see him explore this issue further. So, he&#39;s going to do that for sure. whether whether what he finds after exploring you know many months later uh is another discussion. The other risk you have is an executive order. Um so that&#39;s that. We&#39;re going to tell you what we&#39;re doing around that in a second. Fears around delisting are nothing new. We went through the same back cycle back in 202122 end up with the Chinese government stepping in changing its laws to allow the PCAOB full access to inspect the US listed Chinese companies. Alibaba along with nearly 300 other ADRs passed those audits with flying colors. Now that the PCAOB has had access to over two years, it&#39;s tough to see logical case for dellisting. The other funny thing is the the administration has this fantasy in their mind about golden shares that the P, you know, PRC owns big slugs of these companies and and the fact of the matter is all you have to do is look at the cap table. Okay, they certainly influence. I understand that. That&#39;s just like Trump is influencing Apple and Nvidia and uh shaking them down to invest in the US. That&#39;s a, you know, that&#39;s kind of a good thing, but they don&#39;t really have a choice in the matter. It&#39;s like do what I say or you&#39;re dead. Uh offer they can&#39;t refuse. So, I don&#39;t see how that&#39;s a whole lot different. But the fact of the matter is there are a clear number of shares outstanding. t\n\n### HEADLINES_AND_NEWS\nETF for China internet, uh, put out a great article the next day breaking down the rumors and laying out the facts. He also hosted a tariff briefing webinar that covered, among other things, delisting fears. I highly recommend you listen below. uh talks about we&#39;ve been to this movie before in the last few years. They went through the PCAOB uh etc. Part of it has to do with um Atkins, the new SEC chair, getting votes. You know, he won by 52 votes, so it was a tight vote and some of the people that put him over the top would like to see him explore this issue further. So, he&#39;s going to do that for sure. whether whether what he finds after exploring you know many months later uh is another discussion. The other risk you have is an executive order. Um so that&#39;s that. We&#39;re going to tell you what we&#39;re doing around that in a second. Fears around delisting are nothing new. We went through the same back cycle back in 202122 end up with the Chinese government stepping in changing its laws to allow the PCAOB full access to inspect the US listed Chinese companies. Alibaba along with nearly 300 other ADRs passed those audits with flying colors. Now that the PCAOB has had access to over two years, it&#39;s tough to see logical case for dellisting. The other funny thing is the the administration has this fantasy in their mind about golden shares that the P, you know, PRC owns big slugs of these companies and and the fact of the matter is all you have to do is look at the cap table. Okay, they certainly influence. I understand that. That&#39;s just like Trump is influencing Apple and Nvidia and uh shaking them down to invest in the US. That&#39;s a, you know, that&#39;s kind of a good thing, but they don&#39;t really have a choice in the matter. It&#39;s like do what I say or you&#39;re dead. Uh offer they can&#39;t refuse. So, I don&#39;t see how that&#39;s a whole lot different. But the fact of the matter is there are a clear number of shares outstanding. there is  a clear net income and the net income is divided by those shares outstanding which are disclosed in the uh in the in the public filings and the public holdings of who owns the company. So uh where this fantasy phantom owner is uh it doesn&#39;t make sense because when I divide share count by earnings power I get the exact number that they publish on the website along with every other uh company. So do they influence? Yes. Do they maybe have uh seats on different boards? Yes. Does the US influence our major comp companies now? Yes. Less so a few months ago. Now it&#39;s a major factor. Uh a little bit autocratic if if we&#39;re being objective about it. Uh but as far as them owning shares, it just doesn&#39;t foot. I mean, you could have a fantasy in your mind that that&#39;s the case, but if EPS matches S, it is what it is. Okay. So, uh, okay. So, now that PCAOB has had access to their data for two years, it&#39;s tough to see a logic a logical case for D-listing and betting on delisting or calling China uninvestable has been your belief the last couple years. It hasn&#39;t been a profitable one. But just as we discussed in last week&#39;s article, we need to burden ourselves with the facts, not the rumors, not the noise. What are the actual facts? And here they are. US ADRs are held by US investors, not the Chinese government or Chinese investors. Over $800 billion of US investor capital sits in 286 China ADRs. Dellisting China ADRs would do nothing but vaporize nearly a trillion dollars of US and cap US investor capital, including pension funds for teachers, firemen, police officers, uh etc. um union workers, okay, uh manufacturing people on the assembly line, uh all while the Chinese government laughs all the way to the bank. You basically just took the gun out and shot yourself and took a trillion dollars out of your firepower. Uh two, on the flip side, China old holds $1.3 trillion worth of US treasuries and about $370 billion worth of US equities. They could easily liquidate these in re retaliation. If lowering the 10-year yield is this administration&#39;s top priority. It&#39;s hard to believe they would cross the line, this line, and open the door for such retaliation. It&#39;s natural to make threats when you, you know, when you&#39;re negotiating to get what you want, but doing so would be the equivalent of shooting yourself in the foot on the world stage. And three, the US has the number one capital markets in the world because rumors like this don&#39;t happen. foreign companies, whether from China or elsewhere, pay enormous fees to list in the United States and go through all the regulatory hurdles in vetting. Weaponizing delisting for political purposes wouldn&#39;t exactly encourage foreign companies to IPO or list here in the future, and it would undermine the strength of American capital markets. Basically, you just push tens of billions of dollars of business to London and to Hong Kong. So, uh maybe that&#39;s another reason to be ex US equities uh and looking at opportunities in UK and Hong Kong. Now, if fears over D-listing are keeping you up at night, Baba shareholders can easily convert their US ADS&#39;s to Hong Kong listed shares.\n\nGTN. That's from Keenan Martins. GTN. Great television. All right. I know the guy who runs this, he also has an insurance company I wanted to get involved in. ### HEADLINES_AND_NEWS\nOkay, so this is about the CEO of Intel having Chinese investments through his fund coming under scrutiny. Look, the guy is Chinese. He was vetted by the board of directors. If he has to unwind some of his Chinese investments that his fund is in, he'll unwind some of his Chinese investments. He was on the board, he had the same investments. That that was just noise last week.",
    "### MISCELLANEOUS": "\n\nBut I I just want to say about the Chinese rejecting Boeing aircraft is like a diabetic rejecting insulin. They need our planes more more than we need their sales. That's for sure. I think look in the kingdom of the blind, the oneeyed man is king, okay? The countries that come to the table first and sign the deals first are going to have certainty. T",
    "MACRO_DATA_SLIDES": "\n\nput somewhere else. So, that we'll get to that in a minute. Um, thanks Steve for just sending this over. This is Albamaro and we've covered the overlay of um lithium prices to Albamaro in the past. They got 3.5 billion of excess liquidity to ride or die. Um, and this is the when Albamaro's dividend yield gets around 3%, the stock price tends to bottom. And that's exactly where we are right now. And my response to Steve was we don't own enough. And, you know, at some point you have position limits. You know, there's we we own enough, but you never own enough once it starts turning, you know, and that that's just the way it works. Uh, so thanks Steve D on that. Yurian Timmer been at Fidelity for 40 some odd years. He had an interesting tweet. Easy to forget just how many 20% draw downs we've had just in the last five years. We had a 28% decline in 2022, 35% in 2020, 30 uh 20% in 2018. In other words, every two years the market suffers a large draw down and it has come back every time, sometimes quickly and sometimes slowly. So that's just putting things in perspective. returns after 15% draw downs from Rit Holtz. Um, one year later, uh, 83% positivity rate up 15%, three years up 40, 5 years up 66, 10 years up 158, 185. Uh, this isn't fun, but it happens from Carson Research. Number of corrections in bare markets since World War II, 25 of 10 to 20% what we just had. Seven of 20 to 30, three of 30 to 40, and three of 40% or worse. Foreigners selling US equity funds selling in the hole just like they did during COVID. Really not a good time to sell. China's March lending jumped on government stimulus push. That is going to be the unintended positive consequence. We're going to cover all the D-listing in detail today. Okay, we covered some of it in the article, so just chillax. Um, energy positioning getting to levels where we continue to want to look for more. We're we're very happy with our comm stock as you can tell. Uh, but there will be other things to do. Historical morning start equity research coverage price to fair value estimates at uh month end. So they're trading at price to fair value uh levels that you really only see uh at big drawd downs and and and usually they inflect from these levels. So Morning Star does a really good job on their fair value estimates because they're Buffett accolts. It's a Midwest firm. They're always there. The founder is friends with Buffett, friends with my first boss who was friends with Buffett for 40 years. So I know all these guys. They do really good work. And um okay, now we got uh US exceptionalism theme, a long way to unwind. Um yeah, and this has been kind of coming into the year. We said XUS, this is going to converge. You're going to see outperformance, not doesn't mean US is crashing at all. It just means underperformance. Why? Because of mag 7. All the themes that we covered in the fourth quarter that got you ready to be out of Mag Sev before the first quarter have played out. International was crushing it uh to on a relative basis. Some 60 point spread is probably still not far from that um outperformance and that will come back after any type of package is announced. Expectations for dollar depreciation highest since March May 2006. This was another theme. Dollar would continue to weaken. That is playing out. Soon as package is announced, EM will rebound back quickly. Options traders bet on rally to 120. That is on the euro relative to the dollar. There you go, ladies and gentlemen. Uh Chinese exports up ahead of US tariff hit. By the way, for all the new people, we have a ton of new people. you know, my longtime fans and uh and um awesome partners here uh know all these things that I said three months ago, six months ago, etc. You can go back to the archives and pull up any date and see what we were saying and uh kind of how it played out uh at your leisure. Chinese exports up ahead of US tariff hit. So, a lot of pull forward that's going to help uh obviously helped with US car sales as well. help help with uh uh Baba's earnings I'm sure in the first quarter. So we we'll see how that works out. 42% say gold is best performing asset in 2025. That's part of the reason I think that if they announce a grand package and a currency deval gold is sniffing that out and uh once it's actually announced by the rumor sell the news uh watch out below. Record number of fund manager surveys intending to cut US equities. That's what they always do in the hole at the exact wrong time. Uh record two-month rotation out of US stocks. That's probably a theme that will persist. Relative value of XUS FMS cash surges to 4.8 selling in the whole record by re record by hedge funds. Retail have been buying retail have been right since 2020. Uh COVID S&P liquidity has deteriorated recently. That is another indication that I think what you're going to have to see is the Fed will go back in. They may not cut uh right away, but they are going to go back into quantitative easing and call it something else. Um uh to keep the liquidity going unless a deal is announced, the liquidity will come back naturally. Co total net call volume, they couldn't get enough in January. They couldn't uh you couldn't give them away in April. Well, what does that tell you? Historically, last time was uh Q4 2022 when you couldn't give them away. That was the best time to buy them. So, I don't know what else to tell you, ladies and gentlemen. I mean, this stuff is not rocket science. Even though value stocks, valuations remain, okay, even though value stocks have outperformed year to date, valuations remain significantly attractive. That was one of our other themes. The final theme is going to be small caps. That hasn't worked yet. It is going to work in spades just like the dollar took a little longer. Watch out above, not below. Uh volatility spikes have been opportunities that by the way that requires a package that requires tariff mitigation. That requires all that. But I think it's coming and uh you know for a guy who wants to be on Mount Rushmore, if he can pull this thing off, um it will be unreal. No one's been able to do it post World War II. Uh so you know who knows uh we'll leave it at that. Volatility spikes have been opportunities. Uh S&P average forward price return 1990 to April 2025. Forward periods from when VIX level triggered. And that is uh from periods when VIX weekly closed above 45. And you can see that one year out you're up 34.2%. two years out, which point of this chart is we just had that uh two years out, you're up 51%, three years out, 50, five years out, 112, six years, uh 10 years out, 220%. So hang tight, ladies and gentlemen. Um inflation expectations, highest since June 2021. Okay. net expecting higher shortterm rates. Fascinating. This has a tendency to be right and this has a tendency to be at or near peak inflation for the short term. So that's fascinating. Global model new model launches. Oh, for cars. Oh, lot of lot of new cars. A lot of exciting cars coming out. That's good to see. Uh foreign central bank, which means they're going to flood the lot soon. They've taken down inventories huge by the way in the last few weeks ahead of the tariffs. This is going to be such a great thing because all you see is incentives. So now the aptal purchase price has come down because of all the incentives and because everyone trying to get ahead of tariffs once they do a package um the incentives are going to be expected and the volumes are going to have to replenish the thing. So hang in there on Cooper Standard. I know some of you are getting uh uh your panties in and not but uh chillax. We're going to be okay. Uh foreign central bank smart money record outflow foreign demand for US stocks. So again uh just like they sold in the hole at COVID they're doing the exact same thing.\n\none of the most volatile weeks in history. uh you see the average true range uh and uh these levels fiveday average uh tend to coincide with major bottoms. Uh Trump Nvidia commits to invest $500 billion uh and then he kind of stuck the knife in their back the next day. That&#39;s uh it&#39;s just the environment we&#39;re in. VIX. Can we go wrong buying the S&P 500 with VIX greater than 50? No. We just looked at the data. Great financial crisis COVID. That&#39;s the time to be a buyer, not a seller. I don&#39;t think it&#39;s a wholesale buyer. I think it&#39;s a select bespoke buyer, but a buyer nonetheless. US exceptional theme has peaked. We agree. Not because US isn&#39;t the greatest place in the world. I think it&#39;s just going to be a reversion from seven stocks to 500 stocks. And the 500 stocks represent regular Americans, middle, lower middle class, uh, wage earners, uh, doing a lot better than the investor class who have been jammed into these seven mag seven stocks that just got their asses handed to them. Um, uh, and have no international exposure to offset that. um they&#39;re going to be the ones that are going to do less well and the ones that uh are diversified exus international and you know small cap value all the themes we&#39;ve covered as well as uh regular Americans and that&#39;s when the country hums is when everyone participates not just a few at the top uh charts of the month FMS investor sentiment sinks to five fifth lowest level on record. We covered that in our article. We&#39;ll do that in detail. MAG 7 valuations are at their lowest level since January 2023 pending new earnings guidance. I think the guidance might come down a little bit more. So, this might not be an accurate number yet, but I&#39;m not going to lie. You know, I keep looking at Amazon and even Invidia when it got under 100. Um, time will tell. not doing anything there yet because there&#39;s so many better opportunities. It&#39;s like all those you can buy and if we&#39;re right and we trade back to the top of the range maybe you make you know 30 40 50%. But I&#39;m not really willing to commit any type of capital uh ever unless it&#39;s at least a double if not a triple plus um even if I have to play the time arbitrage game and it plays it takes a few years I just don&#39;t take risk for 30 to 50%. It&#39;s just not not what I do. uh valuations of all major indices are now below their 10-year averages. Uh that&#39;s fascinating with small cap having the largest divergence of 24% below its uh discount below its 10-year average on the forward price to earnings ratio. April 9th was a record for an advancing declining volume. That was that day when Trump said now&#39;s a good time to buy stocks. Um, and I think that tweet is going to go down in history because uh, you know, it did coincide with the low. Okay. Then you got a bounce and you&#39;re kind of consolidating and I think uh, we&#39;re going to resolve higher either immediately or over time. That&#39;s the history of Trump. volatility followed by upside resolution. Uh one month later you&#39;re up on average 5.2%, 10 month 3 months later 11.9% 6 months later 18.2% and 12 months later on average up 29.2. So uh hang on. You know we&#39;re on the Disney ride and uh and we&#39;re getting to the exciting parts here. Scott Brown. Last week, S&P opened lower by 2%, closed up more than 5%. May 1970 was the only other time we&#39;ve seen that. It marked a multi-year low, and stocks gained an additional 56%. That&#39;s a very small sample, Scott, but uh thank you for your service. All right. Big gains tend to lead to much higher prices. Uh here was what happened after 5% gain. uh very similar type of chart. So you were down a little bit 5 days out, but a month later you&#39;re up. Three months later, six months later, you&#39;re up almost 11%. 12 months later, up 27. So the the history supports good things happening. Uh car dealership, securing a loan hasn&#39;t been this easy. That&#39;s surprising. Car dealership guy, April 14th. Securing a car loan hasn&#39;t been this easy since December 2022. Access to auto loans pre-tariffs improved 3.1% year-over-year in March thanks to increases in approval rates, subprime loan share, and down payment percentages. But the number of borrowers who owe more on their loans than their cars are worth also continues to rise. And with the tariff uncertainty in the mix, only time will tell how this loosening will last. By the way, that&#39;s really good news for us because if people are upside down on their cars, they can&#39;t unload them in the used car market u because they got to they got to pay they got to pay off the loan which means the supply of used cars in theory should go down and the supply of new cars with better terms and incentives um is going up. So you might find a scenario where the people with used cars have to hold on to them, which is what helps Advanced Auto Parts, and the people looking to buy cars, you used or new, wind up getting better deals buying new cars versus used cars. Uh, and that helps Cooper Standard volumes. So I like that percentage of overbought and oversold stocks in the S&P 500. Uh, again, you can get the sense there. Volatility index closed above 50. the returns just get huge. One, two, three, four, five years out. When you buy stocks after the VIX closed above 50, it&#39;s day and night. I mean, you&#39;re talking a 55% spread if you did it five years out, buying stocks when the VIX is below 50 versus buying stocks when the VIX is above 50 like last week. Uh, pretty awesome. I&#39;m super excited for uh everyone that&#39;s with me and I&#39;m super excited for the ones that topped up a bit and uh came in fresh as well. Uh, but everyone&#39;s really going to do well based on where we are. Uh, most strategists see S&P rebounding by year end. Uh, widest gap in sellside S&P 500 targets this century. The last time you had this big a gap was 2009, 2002, and 20, I&#39;m sorry, 2009, 2022, and 2002. All times were times to buy. This is This is kind of funny. Democrats one-year inflation expectations are 8%. Republicans one-year inflation expectations are 1%. I mean, it&#39;s it&#39;s unreal. I I mean, people making investment decisions on the basis of their political outlook um is super dangerous. And and I look, I had to tell people during the Biden administration, oh, he&#39;s going to destroy the country. I&#39;m like, yeah, but stocks are going to go up, so have a nice day, you know, go take a chill pill. And same thing here. Trump&#39;s going to destroy the world. Yeah, but stocks are going to go up. So, go take a chill pill. Um, it&#39;ll get resolved. Retail flows as a percent of aggregate market cap. All right. Companies issuing EPS guidance. Earning season. Okay. So, they&#39;re still doing some level of guidance here. This shows you drawdowns. Pretty normal in the scheme of things. ratio of insider buyers versus insider sellers. Insider buying is picking up pretty materially. China retail sales and exports grew faster in March in the face of Trump&#39;s tariffs. Retail sales were the highest in over a year. Industrial production was the highest in over multiple years. Policy uncertainty index versus the S&P 500. So when policy uncertainty peaks tend to be near bottoms. China first quarter GDP tops estimates at 5.4% as growth momentum continues amid tariff worries. 63% of FMS fund manager survey. Investors expect China stimulus to boost growth in the second half of 2025. We agree. China retail sales value turning right back up. That helps Alibaba. uh S&P 600 quarterly EPS growth bottomup consensus. So Q1 they&#39;ve taken down and they think it&#39;s going to come back half back end loaded. We agree. Uh S&P EPS impact depending on the increase in tariff rate. Okay. So you&#39;re looking lowend 7% to 30 30 $7 to $35. All right. United States, they&#39;ve already taken it down seven. United States retail sales year were solid. They say that they&#39;re not confident, but they keep spending. So that&#39;s the difference between the hard data and soft data that we&#39;ve talked about. CEO confidence has fallen to its weakest since the great financial crisis. You know, this guy&#39;s always bearish. Um, and by the way, the last time it got this low was 2022, fall 2022. Many of these folks were super bearish in the hole in 2022. And that was the time to buy, not to sell. Manufacturing, someone&#39;s American dream. Uh, America would be better off if more Americans worked in manufacturing. That&#39;s funny. All Americans and Republican leaning Americans all say 80% say America would be better off if more Americans worked in manufacturing. And then um the percentage so that&#39;s 80% of people and then 20% say I would be better off if I worked in a factory. So it&#39;s like you know someone else should go work at the sweat shop, not me. But um so you kind of got to put this in perspective. I I kind of joke with my friends. I said, &quot;Look, we want people to install the robots, program the robots, monitor the robots, but not become the robots.&quot; Uh so we got to be careful on the type of policy that we wish for. Total foreign pol holdings of US equities, treasuries, and US credit. Foreigners own 18 point uh 18.5 uh 20% of the total equity market, 30% of treasuries, 30% of corporate credit, dollar index and US 10-year yields. Dollar index has been rolling over materially. This 10-year yield bump was kind of um a malfunctioning of the Treasury market which got resolved so far but has the administration on notice to get it get a deal done. All right. Median S&P stock bid assass spread highest since 2020 lows uh 2020 COVID lows. That&#39;s that was a buying time. Russell 3000 liquidity lowest since COVID. So, these are things that you&#39;re going to see if we don&#39;t get a deal soon, you&#39;re going to see liquidity facilities announced that are going to basically be QE under a different name. But, you can&#39;t quue QE your way to consumer confidence and earnings power. So, that will be a temporary solution if they don&#39;t get their act together and and take yes for an answer. uh unbalanced world share of global consumption manufacturing by regions. You can see that this is the balance that Trump wants to work out. We&#39;re going to talk about that in the article. Dollar change 2025 worst start to a year since 1995 for the US dollar. That was part of one of our key themes coming into the year. Inter US dollar weaker. Treasuries get bid. Okay, that started to happen except for this malfunctioning in the last week. um value outperforms growth, international outperforms US, small outperforms large. So, uh the latter hasn&#39;t worked. Many of the former have. I think the latter comes to play once a deal&#39;s inked. Uh stocks are not vote winners for Trump. Middle income households only have 10% of their assets. The other thing that they have to keep in mind, one that we&#39;ve said, if they push this too far, we will have a recession and uh it will be a absolute slaughterfest in the midterm election. So companies will then be able to uh they won&#39;t have to wait three and a half years to uh wait out Trump for making their investment decisions. They they&#39;ll have to wait one and a half years because he will have absolutely zero power after the midterms if they don&#39;t do a deal. If they do do a deal and they do this grand package, uh it could be another sweep, uh which means they&#39;ll be able to get everything done, including taxes, including everything else. So, all these things are in flux, but um point to, you know, it&#39;s kind of you can have the good outcome either the hard way or the easy way, your choice. And um Xi always chose the hard way. We&#39;re going to see if Trump follows the same pattern, but eventually she got his ass handed to him and had to flip the switch uh and shift his policy last year and we saw equities follow and do the right thing after he had exhausted all other possibilities. Uh and we&#39;re going to find out Trump Trump seems to be more proactive. if he likes to get the wins without the pain uh or at least as much of the pain and um you know volatility followed by upside resolution valuation discounts of small caps relative to midcap I mean the these you haven&#39;t had this opportunity since 2020 2001 which we keep going back to and uh that was a record you know the next five six years record out performance for small cap so ignore at your own underperformance peril S&P stock uh performance in 2025. So obviously defensive have have done well. If you back this up a month, this would look entirely different. Cuts like a knife. Net revision momentum for stocks. 12 month forward earnings per share. Obviously, everyone&#39;s downgrading uh estimates in the hole. Just like you saw Goldman Sachs on Monday, they put out a recession call uh at 100 p.m. And then at uh 1:30, Trump tweeted, &quot;We&#39;re going to do an exemption for the electronics.&quot; And then 2:00 they said, &quot;Did we say recession? We were, you know, if you can&#39;t take a joke.&quot; And then two days later they said, &quot;Well, yeah, I know. We took back our recession call. Now we&#39;re going to have a recession.&quot; I mean, these guys are clowns. Clowns without a circus. And uh it I I sympathize with them because it&#39;s it&#39;s not easy to make decisions when the earth keeps shifting underneath you and the rules of the game are unknown. So, uh, I definitely empathize with them, but you got to be less reactive and you got to look at, you know, Charlie Mer, big fan of and student of Charlie Mer is if you understand incentives, you can get a good sense of outcome. And you know, if you look at what are Trump&#39;s incentives, what are G&#39;s incentives, what is the world&#39;s incentives, eventually you know where this is going. The question is, do you know what you own so you can hold on long enough to get the benefits of where any rational thinker would know this is headed? And if you get there, then you use these opportunities uh to be better positioned than everyone else when it\n\nvaluation discounts of small caps relative to midcap I mean the these you haven&#39;t had this opportunity since 2020 2001 which we keep going back to and uh that was a record you know the next five six years record out performance for small cap so ignore at your own underperformance peril S&P stock uh performance in 2025. So obviously defensive have have done well. If you back this up a month, this would look entirely different. Cuts like a knife. Net revision momentum for stocks. 12 month forward earnings per share. Obviously, everyone&#39;s downgrading uh estimates in the hole. Just like you saw Goldman Sachs on Monday, they put out a recession call uh at 100 p.m. And then at uh 1:30, Trump tweeted, \"We&#39;re going to do an exemption for the electronics.\" And then 2:00 they said, \"Did we say recession? We were, you know, if you can&#39;t take a joke.\" And then two days later they said, \"Well, yeah, I know. We took back our recession call. Now we&#39;re going to have a recession.\" I mean, these guys are clowns. Clowns without a circus. And uh it I I sympathize with them because it&#39;s it&#39;s not easy to make decisions when the earth keeps shifting underneath you and the rules of the game are unknown. So, uh, I definitely empathize with them, but you got to be less reactive and you got to look at, you know, Charlie Mer, big fan of and student of Charlie Mer is if you understand incentives, you can get a good sense of outcome. And you know, if you look at what are Trump&#39;s incentives, what are G&#39;s incentives, what is the world&#39;s incentives, eventually you know where this is going. The question is, do you know what you own so you can hold on long enough to get the benefits of where any rational thinker would know this is headed? And if you get there, then you use these opportunities uh to be better positioned than everyone else when it finally  occurs, which is what we&#39;ve done.

Uh and you&#39;ll look back and say, &quot;Yeah, I had some white knuckles. Boy, that was an uncertain time.&quot; But I knew the businesses we own, they&#39;d come out stronger. Even in the worst case scenario, you know, we&#39;re not buying a bodega on the corner that if Trump throws us into a recession is going to shutter and be taken over by a new owner. We are buying the biggest public companies that have brand ownership in their spaces. So, if it got bad, all their competition, their smaller competition that are non-public, etc., uh, are going to go out of business and they&#39;re just going to pick up share. So, either way, they win. If we don&#39;t go into a recession, they&#39;re already the best, so they&#39;re going to rebound the fastest. If we do go into a recession, they&#39;re going to win over a longer term because they&#39;re going to buy up all the people that went out of business, uh, or gain share, one or the other.

FMS investor sentiment is now at its fifth lowest level on record, only behind the 2009 great financial crisis, 2018 trade war, Silicon Valley Bank lows in March of 2023. All of which were significant buying opportunities. US stocks are going to underperform relative to international for a little while but US exceptionalism isn't going away anytime soon. 63% of FMS investors now expect China stimulus to boost growth in the second half. \n\nPay attention. We'll see if the deal and those are some of the components that I covered earlier in the show. The general idea behind a potential deal would involve China focusing more on domestic consumption and less on state subsidized manufacturing while the US cuts back a bit on consumption and builds up its manufacturing base. Alibaba being the toll taker, the top economic priority this year. Right now, consumption makes up about 55% of the overall GDP in China compared to 70 to 80% in wealthier nations. China's aiming to hit 70% by 2035. Consider 40 40% goes through Baba. That's $3.5 trillion. Uh you do the math. That's another 300 billion dollar of earnings. Put a 10 times multiple on that plus their existing business plus their AI. You got a $4 trillion company. So while everyone's waiting for Nvidia to hit 4 trillion, you might be waiting a long time.\n\nSo who's the best position to benefit? Alibaba, the totaker of the middle class, holding 40% of the e-commerce market still growing. It's hard to imagine they don't capture a massive slice of the pie. If a deal's reached between US and China, we'll probably see an even bigger push towards domestic consumption in China. And if tariffs stick around, China will have no choice but to shift towards consumption to make up for the hit export-driven GDP growth. Either way, Alibaba will be laughing all the way to the bank.\n\nr other exchange and can return their ADS and um withdraw the equivalent deposited security i.e. Hong Kong shares uh based on previous cases even after the effective D-listing date. So you don&#39;t have to do this now at all. Uh and D investors p receive the net proceeds upon the termination of the ADR program. Investors take no action uh before and 6 months after. Oh, listen to this. If investors take no action before and 6 months after the D-listing date, the depository will commence the sale of ordinary shares represented by unreturned ADRs at prevailing market price if listed elsewhere. So you&#39;ll basically get the Hong Kong price in cash and pay the net cash proceeds after applicable fees and expenses to the ADR shareholders. So basically, if you do nothing and it stops trading, what this is saying from go Gold Goldman Sachs is it&#39;ll just send you your money at the Hong Kong price. Um, but we don&#39;t want cash, we want appreciation. Uh, and this is just getting started. So, you know, reading this, my inclination is to again do nothing, but uh, as a fiduciary, my inclination is to hedge that risk. So, uh, in my, you know, so that&#39;s that energy earnings, you know, look, I have a monstrous amount of personal exposure and a monstrous amount of derivative exposure. I&#39;m doing nothing with my derivatives. Completely comfortable with that. With the stock, we do all the the same across the board. So, um, so that&#39;s how we play out. I think net effect is it&#39;s going to be a net positive. Um, and then in three and a half years I can convert back to ads&#39;s. Can&#39;t make this stuff up.

And you know, I think net net it&#39;ll be interesting to see who&#39;s the bumper in this.",
      "If you can own Boeing under 160 for the long term, if you can own Disney under 90 for the long term, the parks are, you know, decades and decades of emote. the experiences, the cruise ships, high return on invested capital, and their streaming has shown resiliency, growth, and stability. So, we like this business for the long term, and we love it under 80. Well, it's at 85. No, you mean you love it under 90? Under 90, under 80? You know, look, Stu, if you look back in two years, whether you bought it at $100, whether you bought it at $90, whether you bought it at $85, you're going to look back and pat yourself on the back. This is going to be a lot higher."

    "QXO": [
      "the environment. Uh that&#39;s a good question. You mean he&#39;d prefer coal? Well you look you can&#39;t make it up. Well, I think he wants everything and we&#39;re going to need everything to power the data centers, to power the increased demand, whether it&#39;s EVs, whether it&#39;s data centers, uh, unlimited demand and globally unlimited demand. So, that&#39;s a great way to play it. Okay, your next ticker, QXO. Now, look, that&#39;s a different pick than this in terms of its performance. Uh, I mean, with Comtock Resources, that&#39;s outperformed the S&amp;P 500 uh this day. But QXO, this seems like a little bit of a Where does it go? Yeah, this is a relatively new position for us. This is Brad Jacobs. Brad Jacobs is a winner. He makes money for shareholders. If you had invested a million bucks with him when he started United Rentals in 1997 when he got involved, you&#39;re up 70 some odd, 74x, $74 million. If you did XPO logistics in 2009, he came in, he put 150 million bucks of his own money, bought stock, you&#39;re up 160%, 1 million became 160 million. Now he&#39;s doing a roll up. Same formula, different industry in building products. You got 75 million millennials, 34. They want to buy houses. They can&#39;t afford them. So Besson&#39;s going to deregulate banks, bring down Treasury yields below uh 4%. Okay? Hopefully the good way. Not through not through a recession, but the good way. Uh that will make housing affordable. And Trump is opening, you know, we got 500 million acres of federal land. He&#39;s opening that up to build all these starter homes. So KB Homes will build your starter home. You get an endangered elk free of charge in your backyard. And Brad Jacobs is going to provide all of the building supplies. He&#39;s going to do a rollup. He&#39;s going to add technology. He started with Beacon Roofing Supply. When your roof is leaking, it&#39;s a non-discretionary expense. You don&#39;t think about should we buy a new roof? You have to buy a new roof. I mean, you could patch it, but yeah. Yeah. So, the history of Brad Jacobs is you put money in, you don&#39;t think about it for 5 to 10 years. And this will be 5, six, seven bagger. Uh, at the least, and if history is any prologue, it&#39;ll be a lot more than that. Okay. Potentially a 10 bagger, I think. So, I&#39;d always bet on Brad Jacobs. He is serious. He wrote a book, How to Make a Few Billion. That&#39;s pretty useful because he actually made a few billion dollars. All right. And last, but certainly not least, I really enjoyed this interview with Kristen Scher on NYSE Live. Want to thank Kristen, obviously, and Mel Montana. No relation to Tony Montana from Scarface whatsoever. Mel is fantastic. Mel and uh Kristen are the dream team. We&#39;ll listen in here. Welcome back to NYC TV Live, everyone. I&#39;m Christine Scherer here in studio. Well, stocks are looking at a negative open after what was a muted action yesterday and of course two straight days of gains for the S&P before that. Well, joining me now with more on where we&#39;re headed from here and how investors should respond to all of this is Thomas Hayes. He&#39;s a chair and managing member at Great Hill Capital. Uh Thomas, always great to have you. Great to be here, Kristen. All right, so what do you make of all this market action of late? Uh you want the good news or the bad news? Let&#39;s start with the good news. Okay. Okay. Well, the good news is the same as the bad news, and that&#39;s everyone is pessimistic. Okay. So, you saw the fund manager survey from Bank of America this week. Uh, highest expectations of a recession, fourth highest uh in 20 years. So, we&#39;re talking about 2022, we&#39;re talking about 2020, we&#39;re talking about 2009. Uh, most number of managers wanting to go underweight US equities. So, usually that&#39;s a wash out. And what we&#39;re seeing is the quote unquote dumb money is now the new smart money. Retail investors have been buying a ton of stock on this weakness. Hedge funds have been recordelling in the hole and oddly enough retail investors have been right since co. So let&#39;s talk about what these tariffs mean for companies and and how companies might respond to them. Of course we&#39;re at the beginning of earning season. Thomas, what&#39;s your expectation especially when it comes to guidance? That&#39;s the big deal. I mean the big problem is companies can&#39;t guide in this period of uncertainty and uh Kevin Hasset was was on one of the networks yesterday uh or two days ago now saying we have bundles of deals with amazing terms. Well my message to the administration is how about taking yes for an answer. Uh you saw Vietnam come to the table and they said we&#39;ll do zero tariffs if you do zero tariffs. I understand there&#39;s uh non-tariff barriers, but what the answer should have been was we accept in principle contingent upon working out the non-tariff barriers. Instead, they did not. And what happened? China went to visit Vietnam and they just inked a deal. So, you snooze, you lose. I think the administration has a lot of good things going. They should book one deal and that&#39;s going to give companies more certainty to say, &quot;Hey, here are our three guidance scenarios. If they continue to do deals, good things are going to happen. And if they don&#39;t, medium things are going to happen. And if they really don&#39;t, here are the bad things that could happen. And then the market can kind of get their hands around it. But right now, we&#39;re just shooting in the wind. So we are probably down still about, let&#39;s say, 14% roughly on the S&amp;P 500 from a recent high. Do you think it is rangebound until we get a little bit more certainty? Yeah, we have two frameworks. One would be Trump tariff war 1.0. In 2018, you had a 20% correction. Yes. And then you were at new highs four months later. That&#39;s a possibility. We would love that. Uh the second scenario that we&#39;re looking at is the 2011 European debt crisis. 20% correction and then 3 months of hell, choppy volatility. Even though the bottom was kind of in marginal new lows, it was literally up and down every day for three months of uncertainty until Mario Draghy came out and said, &quot;We&#39;ll do whatever it takes.&quot; So, we need one of those moments. So either way, but even in that case, eight months later, we were at new highs. So I learned early in the business, Kristen, good things happen to people who buy highquality businesses when they&#39;re marked down. And I think this time will be no different. What are some of the high quality names, Thomas, that are on your radar? Yeah, I think number one, don&#39;t give up on PayPal. Everyone is down on PayPal. It&#39;s kind of round trip. It shot up to 90. Everyone&#39;s like, &quot;Woo, we&#39;re up 50%.&quot; Now it&#39;s back down in the 60s. They&#39;re generating recordfree cash flow. 7.5 billion. They&#39;ll probably do 7.5 8 billion. They&#39;re going to buy back 20% of the company in the next 2 years. Alex Chris came from into it. He ran 50% of the revenues. He had a 30 bagger while he was uh running the small business division there. He&#39;s going to do the same things for PayPal. PayPal&#39;s down because EU said, &quot;Oh, you&#39;re going to tariff us. We&#39;re going to tariff your processors.&quot; And people shoot first, ask",
      "Brad Jacobs. He wrote a book, How to Make a Few Billion. And it&#39;s it&#39;s useful because he actually made a few billion. And he&#39;s put 1 billion of his own money in his new project called QXO. This is a building supply rollup play. Uh if you had invested with him in the past, whether it was United Rentals, if you put a million dollars in when he got involved in 1997, you made $79 million to date. If you got involved with XPO Logistics when he got involved, he put 150 million in in 2009, you would have made something like $160 million, 160x. So, uh, we want to bet with him because the trends are there. You know, as a millennial, everyone&#39;s looking to buy houses. They&#39;re waiting because rates are high and there&#39;s not enough supply. T",
      "We agree, but we would not play the waring factions homebuilders. We would pay play the arms dealers like QXO, Generrack, Stanley Black & Decker. We have a lot of exposure to this uh uh directly indirectly. US power use to reach record highs in 2025 2026. Comto stock baby. Comm stock. Uh Trump pushes trade partners to buy more US energy as a way to avoid higher tariffs. Duh. Okay."

      "China's aiming to hit 70% by 2035. I can't emphasize enough how massive this shift toward consumption really is. To put it in perspective, China's GDP in 2024 was 18.8 trillion with consumption making up about 55% or 10.34 trillion if they hit their target of 5% growth this year and then slow to 3% annually through 2035, reaching their 70% consumption goal would mean $18.57 trillion in consumption alone by 2035. Consider 40 40% goes through Baba. That's $3.5 trillion. Uh you do the math. That's another 300 billion dollar of earnings. Put a 10 times multiple on that plus their existing business plus their AI. You got a $4 trillion company. So while everyone's waiting for Nvidia to hit 4 trillion, you might be waiting a long time.\n\nSo who's the best position to benefit? Alibaba, the totaker of the middle class, holding 40% of the e-commerce market still growing. It's hard to imagine they don't capture a massive slice of the pie. If a deal's reached between US and China, we'll probably see an even bigger push towards domestic consumption in China. And if tariffs stick around, China will have no choice but to shift towards consumption to make up for the hit export-driven GDP growth. Either way, Alibaba will be laughing all the way to the bank."

Now, you picked this a year ago or a little more than a year ago, right? It&#39;s been a winner since then, up more than 100%. Um, why are you still bullish? Where do you see it going? I think part of the tariff negotiations is particularly with Europe is going to be you want a reduction in tariffs. You need to take all of our LNG. Okay. They need our LG. We have it in abundance. They need to take it. And they&#39;re going to want to do that deal. Uh, Comtock Resources, 70% owned by Jerry Jones, who owns the Cowboys. uh the proved reserves that they report to the SEC which is 10 years of drilling are worth about uh $8 billion. The enterprise value is around $8 billion. However, their unproved reserves which they do not report uh is another 15 years of drilling. Okay. So, we think that&#39;s worth um about $10 billion which means we think not only it doubled since we talked about it, we think it can double one more time over the next 12 to 24 months. Is there still a push for LG given the Trump administration&#39;s uh not the same focus on converting to more um I&#39;m finding I&#39;m trying to find the word how you care I mean it&#39;s considered a better better for the environment.

The proved reserves PV10 that they have to report to the SEC 10 years of drilling is worth about 78 billion. So that's good. Um there the unproved reserves which they don't have to report is about 15 years of drilling. We estimate that's worth about $10 billion. Uh so we think it can double one more time from here.

Uh C, investors can trade on other exchanges as the stock is listed on a major other exchange and can return their ADS and um withdraw the equivalent deposited security i.e. Hong Kong shares uh based on previous cases even after the effective D-listing date.

      "China will have no choice but to shift towards consumption to make up for the hit export-driven GDP growth. Either way, Alibaba will be laughing all the way to the bank. It&#39;s also worth pointing out that China has a pretty powerful toolkit to speed up this shift towards domestic consumption, namely the long-awaited and much rumored bazooka style stimulus. Unlike its Western counterparts, China didn&#39;t pump out stimulus during the p pandemic. So, they have plenty of room to use both monetary and fiscal tools. That&#39;s a luxury US and Europe just don&#39;t have, and the market seems to have recognized and begun to price this in. So you can see here government debt to GDP. In fact, maybe this is why the Chinese government held back on pulling the trigger. Perhaps they saw a potential Trump 2.0 term and a trade war on the horizon. So they decided to hedge their bets and keep some of the ammo in reserve. Either way, they have the tools and more now more than ever. Good reason to use them. It&#39;s over $20 trillion sitting in household deposits waiting to be spent. It&#39;s time to be unleashed the bazooka. Shifting from domestic consumption and stimulus to a less exciting topic. We figured out it would be a good time to address the elephant in the room. something we thought was in the rearview mirror, which is delisting.\n### HEADLINES_AND_NEWS\nRumors began circulating this past week after Fox Business senior correspondent Charles Gasparina published a tweet below. Charles is a fantastic journalist, really good guy. I&#39;ve had dinner with him before. I know him. Um, and he&#39;s just reporting the information that he gets. Um, and then Brendan Ahern put out an article the next day breaking down. Look, there is  a desire. It&#39;s certainly a negotiating chip. I don&#39;t see a deal where China and the US cut a deal and China&#39;s access to US capital markets is removed. I like that is the nuclear option. If if Trump um cuts off their access to US capital markets, I think the trade war turns into a hot war. I&#39;ll just put it that way. Um, but the joke will be on the US because the only people that get hurt if they delist the US ADRs is US investors and pensions. Um, not the Chinese who own it in Hong Kong. So, uh, that would kind of be like if if if you&#39;re China and you&#39;re competing with the US, the best thing that could ever happen to you is they delist your stocks because number one, you just take your business to London and Hong Kong and international money will find you. it goes where it&#39;s treated best. Number two, $800 billion of investor capital of your opponent has been evaporated. And um so, you know, could there be people that stupid in the administration that would move forward with this? Of course. Um so, we&#39;re going to talk about how you hedge against that. Is the likelihood there that there will be no adult in the room to explain to them in English, like to a three-year-old what happens if you actually do this to yourself and you point the gun not at your opponent. It actually has a reverse uh huzzle that points right back at you. Uh we think so. And we know that the the right people are going to go down to Washington and explain this to them because it&#39;s understandable. You would think this is a way to hurt your enemy, but you know, they tried it with semiconductors and it was the worst thing they ever did. Hopefully, they learned from their mistakes. So, Brendan Ahern, good buddy of mine, he runs the KWEB ETF, number one ETF for China internet, uh, put out a great article the next day breaking down the rumors and laying out the facts. He also hosted a tariff briefing webinar that covered, among other things, delisting fears. I highly recommend you listen below. uh talks about we&#39;ve been to this movie before in the last few years. They went through the PCAOB uh etc. Part of it has to do with um Atkins, the new SEC chair, getting votes. You know, he won by 52 votes, so it was a tight vote and some of the people that put him over the top would like to see him explore this issue further. So, he&#39;s going to do that for sure. whether whether what he finds after exploring you know many months later uh is another discussion. The other risk you have is an executive order. Um so that&#39;s that. We&#39;re going to tell you what we&#39;re doing around that in a second. Fears around delisting are nothing new. We went through the same back cycle back in 202122 end up with the Chinese government stepping in changing its laws to allow the PCAOB full access to inspect the US listed Chinese companies. Alibaba along with nearly 300 other ADRs passed those audits with flying colors. Now that the PCAOB has had access to over two years, it&#39;s tough to see logical case for dellisting.

      "literally a month ago, I was going to call our custodian and have all of our Hong Kong shares convert that we converted during this first fear converted back to Baba ADS&#39;s. And I was like, let&#39;s just hold off. So now I&#39;m going to make the call. Uh I have made the call. I&#39; I put it in two days ago. uh we&#39;re going to convert all of our USADS shares to Hong Kong. Not because we think anything's really going to happen, but we want to hedge against it. Um but we are keeping 100% of our US ADS derivatives because we really can't replicate the upside in those in any other instrument and we can't replicate them in Hong Kong. So where we come out is as a fiduciary we want to hedge our downside. If a nuclear option happens and it was some executive order delisting our options are probably wiped but because we own the shares in Hong Kong over time the equities on that theme China XUS will dramatically more than make up for getting wiped on the derivatives. Uh, so we have to hedge it so we can keep the derivatives. If I if I had to assign a probability of a of a highly stupid decision, I'd put it at like 7 to 12%. But by straddling, you know, where most of our money is in the equities and putting that all in Hong Kong. So if we lose on the options, the stock over the next two years is going to make multiple times of that back and multiple times on the invested overall invested capital of both the derivatives and the stock. So that theme and position in the portfolio will do net exceptional even if the worst case scenario occurs. Um, and then if the best case scenario occurs, which is they just leave it alone and let markets do what markets do, uh, we'll we'll be at no disadvantage by owning the stocks in Hong Kong and we'll get the additional kicker benefit from all of our options uh, and derivatives based in the US. So, we'll get, you know, five bites at the Apple versus two bytes at the Apple. And that's the best way I could think of it because there's no other way to express the expected value on that little pocket of derivatives than the way we have it set up. And we want to ride that and we think that um the odds are in our favor, but we're hedging it out in if they're not and the nuclear option comes, we are prepared for it. we have the stock to to ride uh prospectively in Hong Kong and uh and it will more than make up for the the the loss in uh the USDS uh issue which again we assign a very low probability. So if I've got a 10% probability I'm not going to give up a 5 to 7 5 to 7x expected value over the next 12 to 24 months. I'm just not going to do it. Especially when the percentage of the overall assets is small but the upside is so big. And that's how we're just managing it as fiduciaries in that pocket of our portfolio that's dedicated to China to just hedge against any very small outside risk but not nothing risk and that's all we can do. So the earth shifts underneath us every single day. Uh it doesn't change the underlying business. the underlying business is only going to get better regardless of the outcome. But how do we ensure that we're in a position to guarantee take advantage of it and more likely than not take advantage of it in every single way possible under the sun and that's really what we want to do and that's what we are going to do. So that's how we're dealing with it. You do what you do. I mean, I rode out PCAOB with a ton of US ads and uh and really didn't blink because I knew if if there was a legal respect and framework that ultimately it wouldn't be delisted and that's exactly what happened. uh I have to be open to the dimminimous possibility that a legal framework is not respected and that's why we've taken action and made the request two days ago uh and uh should be executed uh shortly. So, um, and my guess is at these levels, I mean, we we bought plenty of",
      "framework is not respected and that&#39;s why we&#39;ve taken action and made the request two days ago uh and uh should be executed uh shortly. So, um, and my guess is at these levels, I mean, we we bought plenty of BABA last week, by the way. That&#39;ll become 9988, uh, probably tonight or tomorrow, and we look forward to buying more. So, nothing in our thesis has changed. Where we hold the bulk of our money that&#39;s committed to the idea, i.e. in the stock, uh, is going to change just just as a hedge. Uh and because the odds are 90% in our favor that the nuclear option will not be triggered, uh we do nothing with this small piece of our overall assets that has a monstrous upside expected value of, you know, 5x plus uh and we&#39;re going to just ride ride or die on that small piece. And that&#39;s what we always do in the derivative bucket anyway. So uh super excited about that. Fear and greed down here. Buyer not seller. National Association of Active Investment Managers turning up. So that&#39;s good from very low levels. ADR dlisting risk back in focus. This is from Goldman Sachs. I think John sent this. Um I think they go through all the history basically assigning a low probability. Uh here are some of the things that would happen. Following summarizes a simplified procedure for dellisting from an investor&#39;s perspective based on historical precedence. Investors sell before the last day of the ADR trading after 10 days of the filing of form 25 with the SEC. Investors will be able to freely trade and sell the soontobe delisted stock on US exchanges at prevailing market price before the securities last trading day in the US. B. Investors could continue to trade the shares on the OTC market subject to their mandate and investment scope. For instance, Luck and Coffee, LKNCY, was delisted from the NASDAQ on June 29, 2020, but its shares are still trading on the over-the-counter market. Um, so that is um I think",

What is this? Gold to copper ratio. Yeah. All right. uh chance of rate cut down to 72% after Powell&#39;s beautiful speech yesterday.",
      "China's aiming to hit 70% by 2035. I can't emphasize enough how massive this shift toward consumption really is. To put it in perspective, China's GDP in 2024 was 18.8 trillion with consumption making up about 55% or 10.34 trillion if they hit their target of 5% growth this year and then slow to 3% annually through 2035, reaching their 70% consumption goal would mean $18.57 trillion in consumption alone by 2035. Consider 40 40% goes through Baba. That's $3.5 trillion. Uh you do the math. That's another 300 billion dollar of earnings. Put a 10 times multiple on that plus their existing business plus their AI. You got a $4 trillion company. So while everyone's waiting for Nvidia to hit 4 trillion, you might be waiting a long time.\n\nSo who's the best position to benefit? Alibaba, the totaker of the middle class, holding 40% of the e-commerce market still growing. It's hard to imagine they don't capture a massive slice of the pie. If a deal's reached between US and China, we'll probably see an even bigger push towards domestic consumption in China. And if tariffs stick around, China will have no choice but to shift towards consumption to make up for the hit export-driven GDP growth. Either way, Alibaba will be laughing all the way to the bank."

I&#39;m sure he explains all that, but uh no, I don&#39;t think I&#39;d have any problem investing in K web at all."

Ralph Reynolds you think Cooper Sander will be able to make up domestic market reductions through growth in China partners? Seems like BYD is a customer CEO reference plants within China. Uh partially I don&#39;t think you&#39;re going to see the again going back to this call row. Um I don&#39;t think it&#39;s going to be I think it&#39;s going to be better than expected.

There&#39;s not enough margin of safety for me here. So, yeah, it&#39;s a good business and everything else. And I wouldn&#39;t bet against the Chipotle guy. He&#39;s going to figure it out. But, you know, talk to me if it gets down. Well, it&#39;s at 80. I was going to say talk to me if it gets below 100. It&#39;s at 80. All right. Uh, let&#39;s see. Yeah, I think for the long term, you&#39;re okay betting on this guy and this business. Uh, but I think you also might have an opportunity to get it a little cheaper. There&#39;s a lot of competition. Dutch Bros, everything else. I I would just I mean to say I&#39;d buy it at 70 or 75 and I wouldn&#39;t buy it at 8085 is pretty silly if it&#39;s a longterm thing, but that&#39;s kind of where I come out. Um, all right. Next, Matt Mitchell LVMH."

Jason Moore, my son and I listen to your podcast each week. Thanks for all you do. AES, thank you for watching. AES, I mean, you got a utility. What&#39;s the dividend yield? Pretty sure that&#39;s a utility. 7% yield. Yeah, I guess you just got to look at their cap table, but I mean their capital structure for debt refinance, but I generally think you&#39;re okay with that 7% yield. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Let me rephrase that. What the hell is going on here? I I would just avoid this. This This is crazy for a utility. Where are these guys? is based in Virginia. All right. If you can get unshakable confidence that this negative free cash flow is over, maybe."

I I just It&#39;s such a sick I I&#39;ll tell you what&#39;s what what&#39;s not going to happen is you&#39;re not going to get a triple or quadruple. And in Intel, if they do it half right, that&#39;s what&#39;s going to happen. So why would I screw around with this? Manique, is Charles Payne short or are you should have been in the NBA? How tall are you? Number one, Charles Payne is not short. Uh he&#39;s uh he&#39;s tall, tall, handsome guy."

[Music] Um, I understand what you&#39;re saying. You&#39;re generally right, but there are factors that you don&#39;t know that you don&#39;t know. So, uh, for me, it&#39;s a pass. Uh, Tom, you&#39;re the bacon bringinger. Okay, so this is about the CEO of Intel having Chinese investments through his fund coming under scrutiny. Look, the guy is Chinese. He was vetted by the board of directors. If he has to unwind some of his Chinese investments that his fund is in, he&#39;ll unwind some of his Chinese investments. He was on the board, he had the same investments. That that was just noise last week. Uh, and that&#39;s it. So,"
