[289.6s] facts. Great Hill Capital hat.
[291.919s] Congratulations to all the winners.
[293.759s] Thanks for sending in your photos. And
[295.919s] let&#39;s get down to media. First want to
[298.0s] thank Stu Vney and Christian Dagger for
[300.8s] having me on Friday remote before I went
[303.759s] out. Uh we&#39;re going to listen in here.
[305.759s] Okay, market still in the red. Thomas
[308.08s] Hayes joins me now. Thomas, big picture.
[310.8s] Have we seen the bottom yet?
[313.759s] I think we&#39;re there or close. There&#39;s a
[315.84s] saying, Stu, out of crisis comes
[317.68s] opportunity. If you look at Trump 1.0
[320.56s] trade war in 2018, the market fell 20%
[324.72s] into December. Four months later, it was
[327.44s] at new highs. If you think this is going
[329.44s] to take a little longer, we look at the
[331.12s] European debt crisis in 2011. Market
[334.16s] fell 20%. Eight months later, the market
[336.8s] was at new highs. But I think you&#39;re
[338.56s] there. Maybe you go back and retest. I
[340.4s] heard my buddy Kenny Pulkari earlier on
[342.32s] the show. That&#39;s certainly a
[343.68s] possibility. But, uh, this is the time
[345.84s] when you want to be buying high quality
[348.4s] businesses for the long term and keep
[350.56s] your head, keep your cool. Easier said
[353.039s] than done. You got two stocks that you
[355.12s] particularly like. Let&#39;s start with
[356.639s] Boeing. Why do you like them? Well, uh,
[359.68s] in the context on focusing what you on
[361.84s] what you can control and buying good
[364.24s] assets when they&#39;re marked down, you&#39;ve
[365.84s] got one of the best businesses in the
[367.36s] world. A duopoly with a half a trillion
[369.919s] dollar backlog with a new CEO, Kelly
[372.56s] Ortberg, is turning turning the ship
[374.319s] around just like you did at Rockwell
[375.84s] Collins. Uh, 10-year backlog. This is a
[378.319s] great business duopoly and not going to
[380.8s] be as impacted by tariffs simply because
[383.84s] if you want a plane, you can go to them
[385.52s] or you can go to Airbus and that&#39;s about
[387.199s] it. How about Disney? That&#39;s been badly
[389.6s] beaten down. You It&#39;s in a dip. You
[392.16s] buying the dip?
[394.08s] There&#39;s no question about it. If you can
[395.68s] own Boeing under 160 for the long term,
[398.4s] if you can own Disney under 90 for the
[400.8s] long term, the parks are, you know,
[402.96s] decades and decades of emote. the
[405.28s] experiences, the cruise ships, high
[407.36s] return on invested capital, and their
[409.52s] streaming has shown resiliency, growth,
[412.4s] and stability. So, we like this business
[414.88s] for the long term, and we love it under
[416.88s] 80. Well, it&#39;s at 85. No, you mean you
[420.08s] love it under 90? Under 90, under 80?
[422.639s] You know, look, Stu, if you look back in
[424.72s] two years, whether you bought it at
[426.16s] $100, whether you bought it at $90,
[428.639s] whether you bought it at $85, you&#39;re
[430.72s] going to look back and pat yourself on
[432.08s] the back. This is going to be a lot
[433.36s] higher. Well, that would be nice. Okay,
[435.199s] Tom, thanks for joining us. The bell is
[437.199s] ringing. That means the trading begins
[439.199s] in about 10 seconds.
[441.52s] And we&#39;re back then. I had the pleasure
[444.96s] to
[445.8s] join Mattie Mills on Monday morning. Uh,
[450.8s] want to thank Mattie Mills, Justinifer,
[453.599s] just excuse me, Matty Mills, Justin
[455.759s] Oliver, Cheyenne Reed for having me on
[458.319s] for the full hour. Stephen did a good
[461.039s] job cutting 60 minutes into 15 minutes
[464.479s] so you can get all the key spots. Uh or
[467.599s] at least I&#39;m I&#39;m pretty sure he did. I
[470.16s] haven&#39;t spent the 15 minutes to watch
[471.919s] the whole thing yet, but you can find
[473.599s] the entire hour
[475.84s] um at the YouTube channel. Go to
[480.56s] YouTube, put in the search bar hedge
[482.56s] fund tips. You&#39;ll see it in the first
[484.0s] four or five videos. Uh also, while
[486.56s] you&#39;re at hedge funips.com, click on
[488.879s] terms. This is all opinion, not advice.
[491.12s] Talk to your financial advisor uh um
[494.319s] before you do anything. Well, I do want
[496.319s] to bring in Thomas Hayes. He is the
[498.0s] chairman and managing member of Great
[499.68s] Hill Capital, an equity manager based
[501.759s] servicing accredited investors and
[503.759s] qualified institutions. He also has a
[505.52s] weekly podcast called Hedge Fund Tips
[507.36s] with Tom Hayes where he shares his
[509.039s] market insights and he&#39;s going to join
[510.72s] me as my guest host for the hour
[512.479s] answering my questions, the audience&#39;s
[514.24s] questions, and of course asking
[516.0s] questions to some of our guests. Tom,
[517.519s] great to have you in. for having me.
[519.599s] Happy to be here. So, we were just
[520.8s] talking about how you do a great job of
[523.039s] getting questions in from your audience
[524.959s] on your podcast and answering some of
[526.8s] those questions. What would you say is
[528.56s] the single biggest question you&#39;ve
[530.24s] gotten over the last week or two? Well,
[532.32s] I think people are a little bit
[534.16s] concerned about the uncertainty of the
[535.92s] tariffs. How long is this correction
[537.76s] going to last? How when when are the
[539.519s] lows in? And I I think this time it&#39;s a
[542.08s] little bit different than people worried
[544.16s] about the great financial crisis. People
[545.6s] worried about the tech wreck. Is this
[547.04s] going to continue to cascade? This is
[548.8s] man-made. This is not a function of
[550.56s] multi-year buildups like you saw in the
[552.48s] late &#39;9s with the tech tech exuberance.
[554.959s] It&#39;s not a function of excess in the
[556.56s] housing market like you saw with the
[557.839s] great financial crisis. Uh this started
[560.0s] with a tweet. It could end with a tweet.
[561.92s] Uh one one day you could wake up and and
[564.0s] you see this beautiful tweet that says,
[565.839s] &quot;I just got off the phone with Xihinping
[568.0s] and the market rallies.&quot; Uh two analoges
[570.88s] I&#39;m looking at, Maddie. First and
[572.24s] foremost was Trump 1.0 trade war. We had
[574.72s] a 20% correction in uh 2018. It took
[578.399s] four months to recover to new highs. And
[581.04s] then if we get a little more volatility
[582.88s] with all the negotiating, we go back to
[585.12s] 2011 and look at the European debt
[587.839s] crisis. We have some debt rumblings here
[590.24s] with US treasuries. That took 3 months
[593.2s] and it was extremely volatile uh
[595.76s] volatile. However, once you you nearly
[598.48s] touch that 20%, the bottom was in. So,
[601.2s] we&#39;re pretty sanguin and pretty
[602.64s] constructive to buy stocks at these
[604.48s] levels. And are you suggesting buying
[607.36s] stocks kind of across the board or are
[609.279s] there certain areas investors should
[611.12s] look at more than others? Well, I think
[613.12s] it&#39;s it&#39;s what you want to get in terms
[614.8s] of return. So, we look for some of the
[616.64s] beaten down sectors because we want to
[618.079s] get excess return over time. Uh, one of
[620.56s] the groups that we&#39;re looking at is
[622.079s] homebuilders. Believe it or not, you
[623.68s] can&#39;t give them away right now, but we
[625.279s] like a gentleman named Brad Jacobs. He
[627.68s] wrote a book, How to Make a Few Billion.
[629.519s] And it&#39;s it&#39;s useful because he actually
[631.2s] made a few billion. And he&#39;s put 1
[633.6s] billion of his own money in his new
[635.6s] project called QXO. This is a building
[639.04s] supply rollup play. Uh if you had
[641.92s] invested with him in the past, whether
[643.68s] it was United Rentals, if you put a
[645.6s] million dollars in when he got involved
[646.959s] in
[647.88s] 1997, you made $79 million to date. If
[652.079s] you got involved with XPO Logistics when
[654.8s] he got involved, he put 150 million in
[656.64s] in 2009, you would have made something
[658.88s] like $160 million, 160x. So, uh, we want
[662.72s] to bet with him because the trends are
[664.16s] there. You know, as a millennial,
[665.6s] everyone&#39;s looking to buy houses.
[666.88s] They&#39;re waiting because rates are high
[668.56s] and there&#39;s not enough supply. There is
[670.32s] a 4 million unit shortage and as we
[673.04s] know, Trump is going to open up federal
[674.88s] land. So, not only do you get your
[676.24s] starter home from KB Homes, you get an
[678.32s] endangered elk in your backyard free of
[680.24s] charge. Uh but the the fact of the
[682.399s] matter is supply is coming online. He&#39;s
[685.68s] going to benefit. And he started off
[687.2s] with a company called Beacon Roofing.
[689.839s] Everyone needs a roof. When your roof is
[691.68s] leaking, it&#39;s a nondiscretionary
[693.44s] expense. You don&#39;t think about should we
[695.12s] plug the roof? We we replace the roof
[697.04s] immediately. Yeah. He bought it at 10
[698.8s] times Ebida. He kind of paid up, but
[700.56s] he&#39;s going to add technology as he
[702.16s] always does and double Ebida over the
[704.16s] next few years. And I know another name
[705.6s] that you&#39;re looking at CRK, I believe.
[707.36s] Yeah. Comtock Resources. Well, guess
[709.2s] what? Not only do we have negotiations
[710.88s] with China, we had negotiations with
[712.959s] Europe. And what do we want to sell
[714.16s] Europe? We want to sell Europe our LNG.
[717.279s] And Commtock Resources is controlled by
[719.76s] Jerry Jones, who also owns the Dallas
[721.839s] Cowboys. He&#39;s an oil and gas legend. He
[724.64s] owns 70% of the stock. We got involved
[726.8s] around $9. It&#39;s doubled. However, if you
[729.6s] look at proven reserves of this company,
[732.88s] uh they&#39;re worth about what enterprise
[735.04s] value is now. But the real value, the
[737.36s] real unleash is unproved reserves.
[739.519s] They&#39;ve got over 15 years of drilling
[742.639s] that&#39;s not recognized on their
[744.32s] financials because they&#39;re only required
[745.76s] to report PV10. So we think from these
[749.279s] levels over the next 24 months, this
[751.12s] stock can not only, you know, it&#39;s
[752.48s] already doubled since we started talking
[753.839s] about, we believe it can double one more
[755.519s] time uh over the next 12 to 24 months.
[757.839s] So we love the LG play. We know Europe
[759.92s] is going to start taking a lot more of
[761.2s] our gases in exchange for tariff
[763.2s] mitigation and it&#39;ll be a very good
[764.8s] thing. All right, two stock picks for
[766.56s] you from our guest host, Tom Hayes. Tom,
[768.24s] you&#39;re going to stick with us for the
[769.6s] hour. Appreciate it. Thank you so much.
[771.519s] Well, President Trump&#39;s tariff policies
[773.44s] got a little more confusing over the
[774.959s] weekend, leaving investors once again
[776.56s] uncertain about the market outlook. Our
[778.639s] next guest has sectors that are
[780.32s] currently offering safety and also has
[782.399s] ones to avoid. We are joined here by
[784.399s] Eric Bay. He is Sound Income Strategies
[786.639s] co-chief investment officer. Eric, great
[789.2s] to speak with you. I I absolutely agree
[791.12s] with you on the material side.
[792.8s] Absolutely bombed out. We&#39;re looking uh
[795.04s] we we kind of share an affinity here. I
[796.72s] can tell you have a value tilt to you.
[798.639s] We&#39;re looking at Albamaro, for instance.
[800.56s] They got $3 billion of excess liquidity.
[802.8s] Are there any uh materials names that
[805.36s] you&#39;re looking at, Eric? Well, we we own
[808.079s] a bunch of them. One that I really like
[809.68s] that a lot of people don&#39;t because of uh
[811.76s] they&#39;re afraid the dividend will be cut
[813.2s] is Dowo Chemical, one of the best
[815.44s] companies in the world. Unfortunately,
[818.0s] they they have had their and Lionell a
[820.959s] similar company also in plastics have
[823.04s] seen their demand come down a bit. Um
[825.68s] but I think over a long period of time
[827.6s] those are two companies that you
[828.8s] definitely want to own. They&#39;re both
[829.76s] high yielding stocks and they have
[831.68s] substantial capacity for rebound both in
[833.839s] their margins, volumes and earnings both
[836.079s] of course cash flows. Eric I got to know
[838.48s] about ADT. This thing has been a value
[840.639s] trap forever. Uh you know before it went
[843.68s] private now since it&#39;s it&#39;s gone public
[845.68s] again. Give me the growth story. Why is
[848.079s] this thing going to come out of this
[849.36s] range? Why is this not going to be a
[851.199s] value trap? I want to believe. I want to
[853.04s] believe. Talk to me, Eric. Sounds very
[855.68s] easy to sell ADT now because they sold
[858.639s] their commercial business. They
[859.839s] deleveraged the balance sheet and their
[861.44s] earnings are growing now. Thank you so
[863.44s] much. We got to leave it there. Thank
[864.639s] you. Coming up, we&#39;re going to take a
[866.0s] closer look at some of today&#39;s big stock
[868.079s] movers, including an incoming lipmus
[870.16s] test for luxury retail. That&#39;s next. The
[873.199s] upside. Thomas, we were just talking
[874.639s] about some of the regulatory pressure on
[876.8s] LVMH, but when it comes to their
[879.36s] exposure to China, at least to the
[880.88s] Chinese consumer, they could be a
[882.56s] beneficiary. Yeah, there&#39;s no question
[884.16s] about it. The Chinese government has
[885.76s] explicitly stated they&#39;re going in all
[887.76s] in on massive consumption stimulus for
[890.72s] the Chinese population to offset any
[893.44s] impact from the Trump tariffs. So, LVMH
[896.399s] is going to be a major beneficiary of
[897.839s] that. If I look at my credit card bill
[899.839s] every month, 10% is probably Sephora
[902.399s] from my 10 and 12 year old girls. They
[904.24s] they spend all their free time at
[906.0s] Sephora. So LVMH uh I I think you have
[909.44s] to start to look at these companies that
[911.04s] benefit from Chinese consumption because
[913.6s] uh I think the government you know we&#39;ve
[915.44s] waited for this China recovery for two
[917.76s] plus years and I think they&#39;ve held back
[919.44s] this stimulus because they were
[921.44s] anticipating the possibility of of
[923.199s] tariff friction and this would be a way
[925.199s] for them to offset it and to continue to
[927.76s] grow. uh you know Alibaba will be a
[930.24s] major beneficiary from massive
[931.68s] consumption and the Chinese government
[932.959s] has explicitly stated uh we want to get
[935.76s] our people to 70 our economy to 70%
[939.36s] consumption within 10 years that is a
[941.76s] huge stretch so companies like this have
[944.079s] a long secular tailwind we&#39;ll have
[946.72s] short-term volatility and bumpiness but
[948.72s] on red days and there&#39;s going to be
[950.32s] opportunity to buy really great
[951.6s] companies and we should mention just for
[953.279s] the audience it&#39;s really interesting to
[954.72s] see China kind of do a U-turn on
[956.24s] stimulus because the government has been
[957.68s] very anti stimulus obviously didn&#39;t
[960.0s] offer it during COVID and now we&#39;re
[961.6s] hearing them come out and offer this
[963.279s] stimulus potentially off the back of
[964.639s] these tariffs. So certainly a U-turn
[966.32s] from the government there. But let&#39;s go
[968.16s] next to TMC. It is a metals company and
[970.639s] rare earth minor MP MP materials also
[973.839s] rising after a report that President
[975.759s] Trump is planning a stockpile order. The
[978.32s] Financial Times says Trump is drafting
[980.0s] an executive order to stockpile deep sea
[982.24s] critical metals in an effort to counter
[984.24s] China as the US seeks to become
[986.0s] self-sufficient with these assets. So,
[987.519s] let me give you a little bit more
[988.48s] context here. China saying that they are
[990.399s] no longer going to be able to export
[992.72s] some of these rare earth minerals. That
[994.24s] is just the latest retaliatory move from
[996.399s] China when it comes to the trade war.
[998.48s] And then you have President Trump firing
[1000.48s] back to the degree that he can, saying,
[1002.0s] &quot;Okay, well, we will just start
[1003.44s] stockpiling what we have available.&quot; Um,
[1005.839s] but as you know, Tom, obviously these
[1007.6s] are really critical minerals. They go in
[1009.44s] the likes of motors and cars, obviously
[1011.759s] chips for phones as well. So, it&#39;s
[1013.759s] something that we we do need and it&#39;s
[1016.079s] something that the administration is
[1017.36s] focused on. Yeah, there&#39;s no question
[1018.8s] President Trump believes he holds the
[1020.16s] cards, but China has one major card
[1021.92s] here. When you look at a company like
[1023.519s] TMC, it&#39;s an $800 million company. So,
[1026.0s] like how much can you stockpile based on
[1027.679s] their current production? I think this
[1029.199s] is going to help us get to a sensible
[1031.36s] place with tariffs, a reasonable
[1033.36s] agreement where we get more than we had.
[1035.28s] Uh, China gets less than they had. We
[1036.959s] kind of bridge that surplus. And I think
[1038.799s] embedded in this what we&#39;re going to
[1040.079s] find ultimately it&#39;s going to come down
[1041.6s] to a reval of the currency relationship.
[1045.039s] Chinese taking the yuan up further to
[1047.839s] kind of bal balance that imbalance. Uh
[1050.559s] and uh and and we won&#39;t have to put such
[1052.559s] pressure on tiny companies like TMC to
[1054.48s] stockpile rare rare minerals that China
[1057.12s] has in abundance. Yeah, certainly a
[1059.039s] smaller company when it comes to the
[1060.559s] ones that we talk about here. But let&#39;s
[1062.48s] end with a bigger firm. Sony announcing
[1064.799s] price hikes for its PlayStation 5
[1066.72s] console across Europe, the UK,
[1068.4s] Australia, and New Zealand. The company
[1070.48s] citing the quote challenging economic
[1072.32s] environment, including high inflation
[1074.32s] and fluctuating exchange rates. BS5
[1076.799s] Digital Edition will now cost nearly
[1078.84s] $570 in Europe and the UK, an increase
[1081.84s] of 11% and 10% respectively. And there
[1085.28s] you can see the shares moving to the
[1086.4s] upside alongside the broader market by
[1088.32s] about 2%. Is this just the beginning of
[1091.12s] price hikes that we&#39;re going to start
[1092.4s] seeing more broadly across the globe?
[1094.08s] Well, it&#39;s it must be an amazing
[1095.679s] franchise to have that pricing power and
[1097.76s] to say we are raising prices on on our
[1100.799s] PlayStation because it&#39;s a challenging
[1102.96s] environment. In other words, we don&#39;t
[1104.64s] want to do it, but you need our product
[1106.48s] so much that even though you&#39;re
[1108.08s] challenged, we&#39;re going to raise the
[1109.2s] price and we&#39;re going to do just fine.
[1110.72s] So, you may see some of that uh across
[1112.559s] the board. We&#39;ll know more in coming
[1114.799s] weeks and months as this thing gets
[1116.4s] resolved country by country. You had
[1118.24s] Hassid on uh uh earlier this morning
[1120.559s] talking about maybe some package deals,
[1122.4s] getting a bunch of countries done at
[1124.0s] once. You start getting that stuff hit
[1125.84s] the tape and this this bottom in the
[1127.84s] markets could be durable. Let&#39;s see how
[1129.84s] it comes in coming days and coming
[1131.2s] weeks. Let&#39;s certainly see it is
[1132.64s] fascinating. I&#39;ve spoken with sources
[1134.0s] before who&#39;ve told me that these
[1135.36s] consoles, these video game players, they
[1137.12s] there&#39;s not like an off-brand version.
[1138.799s] So, they do have a lot of that pricing
[1140.24s] power. To your point, Tom, you&#39;re going
[1141.679s] to stick with us for the second half
[1143.039s] hour of our show. And by the way, you
[1144.32s] can scan the QR code to track the best
[1146.0s] and worst performing stocks with Yahoo
[1147.76s] Finance&#39;s trending tickers page. So, I
[1150.799s] have a question for Andrew. Uh, what do
[1153.2s] you see CEOs doing? What&#39;s their
[1156.0s] strategy? Are they saying we&#39;ll just
[1157.84s] wait it out and eat it for three and a
[1159.52s] half years? Are they going to stand up
[1160.96s] factories in the US? And then what what
[1162.96s] happens if policy changes three and a
[1164.72s] half years from now? There&#39;s a lot of
[1166.32s] confusion. How how do you play that? And
[1168.559s] do the big get bigger as the smaller
[1170.559s] players just go out of business or h how
[1173.12s] are you thinking about it? How are CEOs
[1175.039s] thinking about it from large companies
[1176.72s] to small companies? So there&#39;s still a
[1179.6s] lot of uncertainty. Marco, when do you
[1181.28s] think we&#39;re going to see the pivot from
[1182.799s] the uncertainty of tariffs to the
[1185.2s] opportunity for growth with tax cuts,
[1187.88s] deregulation? In other words, package
[1190.08s] this up like Kevin Hasset was talking
[1192.0s] about this morning. Maybe packages of
[1193.84s] countries all at once. put the pain
[1196.16s] behind us and now focus on growth,
[1198.36s] deregulation, tax cuts, etc. When do you
[1200.72s] think when do you anticipate seeing that
[1202.32s] pivot?
[1204.24s] It&#39;s very hard to tell, right? I I I
[1206.4s] don&#39;t think, as I said, I don&#39;t I don&#39;t
[1208.48s] expect uncertainty to dramatically
[1210.72s] decrease in a very short time. I think
[1212.88s] uncertainty is here to stay. Are you
[1215.36s] shifting your allocation to XUS or you
[1219.2s] haven&#39;t made that decision as a as a
[1220.88s] firm yet? We haven&#39;t made this decision
[1223.919s] yet. I will not like talk about specific
[1226.559s] portfolio allocation here, but is there
[1229.28s] is a sign that something may have
[1230.96s] changed? Well, coming into earnings, are
[1233.36s] you comfortable with the valuation 37
[1235.679s] times forward? You got a $400 billion
[1238.0s] enterprise value on 7 billion of free
[1240.159s] cash flow. You know, that kind of
[1241.6s] compares to Disney, for instance.
[1243.52s] They&#39;ve got 8.5 billion of free cash
[1245.679s] flow and maybe 190 billion enterprise
[1248.159s] value. Oh, and by the way, you get the
[1250.0s] parks and you get the experiences and
[1251.52s] you get the cruise ships for free. um
[1253.76s] just talk about what that means in terms
[1256.24s] of exceeding expectations and now that
[1258.72s] they&#39;re not reporting subscribers and
[1260.559s] you&#39;ve seen Disney kind of stall at 178
[1263.2s] million subscribers and Netflix maybe
[1265.52s] stall at 300 million subscribers. Uh
[1268.0s] what are your thoughts on the relative
[1269.28s] value? I mean it&#39;ll be interesting to
[1271.679s] see how the fundamentals actually shake
[1273.36s] out and what we what kind of commentary
[1276.0s] we actually get from senior management.
[1278.08s] They&#39;re going to guide the market.
[1279.44s] they&#39;re going to give us that strategic
[1281.159s] conviction in terms of whether we
[1283.76s] believe the Bulls or the Bears. Like
[1285.36s] whose assumptions do we go with? And in
[1288.88s] terms of Disney, we can&#39;t forget that
[1290.88s] they have a substantial amount of their
[1293.32s] business in the Far East. So they are
[1297.12s] also exposed. And you know, I think net
[1300.36s] net it&#39;ll be interesting to see who&#39;s
[1303.28s] the bumper in this. That&#39;s over at Great
[1305.919s] Hill Capital. And Tom has a question for
[1307.52s] you. Yeah, Andrew. So re reusable
[1309.44s] rockets is is the name of the game.
[1311.2s] What&#39;s your level of confidence?
[1312.799s] Obviously Falcon 9 has done thousands of
[1315.44s] of missions up there and brought
[1317.12s] satellites up uh with no problem
[1318.88s] whatsoever. Uh then you&#39;ve got Boeing
[1321.36s] with Vulcan. They&#39;ve had two trips. So
[1323.6s] that&#39;s a positive. And then you&#39;ve got
[1325.52s] Blue Origin with New Glenn just doing
[1328.4s] one trip. How do you expect that
[1330.799s] competition to accelerate over the next
[1332.559s] couple years? And kind of what are your
[1334.24s] heaviest weights in the ETF that are
[1336.159s] that are playing the space theme?
[1338.4s] Yeah. So, you know, launch is extremely
[1340.64s] important and yes, it&#39;s been great for
[1342.88s] getting cost down, but you do have more
[1344.96s] players coming out. Um, you you look at
[1347.679s] what Amazon is doing with Project Hyper,
[1350.159s] and they didn&#39;t just sign up Blue Origin
[1352.64s] to be a launch provider to get their
[1354.159s] satellites up into space. They actually
[1356.0s] contracted four different companies for,
[1358.0s] I believe, about 80 launches scheduled
[1359.84s] over the next several years. Thank you
[1362.08s] so much for joining us. Really quick,
[1363.84s] Thomas Hayes, want to get your thoughts.
[1365.2s] Final 30 seconds of the show. We&#39;re
[1366.799s] still seeing green on our screen across
[1368.32s] the major averages. How much can
[1369.84s] investors trust this relative optimism
[1372.32s] today? Uh you can&#39;t trust it on a daily
[1374.48s] basis, but focus on what you can control
[1376.72s] when the markets marked down like this.
[1378.4s] What if you focus on buying highquality
[1380.48s] companies that are marked down? One of
[1382.159s] the companies we were buying last week
[1383.76s] aggressively was uh Disney at $85. You
[1386.72s] don&#39;t have to think hard about Disney.
[1388.4s] It&#39;s down from $200. Over the next few
[1390.72s] years, it&#39;s going to recover. Tariffs or
[1392.24s] no tariffs, it&#39;s going to be okay.
[1393.919s] Boeing was a company we were adding to.
[1395.919s] it got down to1 $129 down from $350 some
[1400.4s] odd dollars. This is a duopoly in in in
[1403.12s] the aircraft space. So if you buy great
[1405.28s] companies and you and you have a
[1407.12s] long-term view 12 to 24 months, you&#39;re
[1409.039s] going to do great out of this
[1410.0s] opportunity. To that end, Nvidia was
[1411.52s] under $100 a couple weeks ago as well.
[1413.44s] So certainly something to keep in mind.
[1415.52s] Thank you so much Thomas Hayes of Great
[1416.96s] Hill Capital for joining us. Appreciate
[1418.559s] it. Coming up, we&#39;ve got wealth
[1419.84s] dedicated to all your personal finance
[1421.36s] needs. Brad Smith has you for the next
[1423.12s] hour. Stay tuned.
[1425.76s] And uh this was BBC that same night.
[1429.679s] Want to thank
[1433.08s] um want to thank Adam Hancock for having
[1436.64s] me on that that I&#39;m going to ask you to
[1438.88s] watch on your own. Uh you can find it at
[1441.919s] the website or at the YouTube channel.
[1444.559s] We&#39;re just trying to conserve time here.
[1447.28s] Um that was a good one. Want to
[1450.36s] thank here. I&#39;d like to thank Nicholas
[1453.44s] Palazo and obviously Charles Payne for
[1456.24s] having me in his new studio in person.
[1459.52s] Someone asked me how tall am I? Look,
[1461.84s] I&#39;m 6&#39;5. Charles is also a tall man. I
[1465.039s] think it&#39;s camera angle because I&#39;ve
[1467.12s] stood with him at his old prompter
[1469.279s] screen uh back in the old studio. And
[1472.159s] you know, it didn&#39;t look this uh a
[1475.2s] one-sided here. So, uh, uh, if if we
[1478.32s] were, uh, going to play one-on-one
[1480.64s] basketball, I&#39;d bet on Charles here. Not
[1482.4s] only is he tall, he&#39;s fast, and he&#39;s
[1484.08s] smart. But, um, really enjoyed. We&#39;re
[1486.88s] going to listen in here. It will never
[1488.559s] be the same. They keep pouring cold
[1490.559s] water. I mean, here&#39;s what the big thing
[1492.4s] was last week. Don&#39;t look for a Vshaper
[1494.64s] rebound, right? I do like this, though,
[1496.559s] because Funstrap put this out. Really
[1498.96s] great table. uh they show historically
[1502.0s] right of the 11 bottoms since 1929 seven
[1506.08s] actually did have a V-shaped recovery.
[1507.76s] So I want to bring in great Hill Capital
[1509.2s] chairman Thomas Hayes and Thomas so many
[1510.799s] observers you know are are you know
[1513.08s] investors are spoiled by this one 2020
[1516.32s] it was the sharpest bare market in
[1518.24s] history. It felt, you know, co we&#39;re
[1520.4s] never going to make money again. But it
[1522.24s] also was an amazing V-shaped recovery
[1524.08s] throughout almost all of it. Everyone
[1526.08s] would come on the show and say, everyone
[1528.24s] was skeptical. It can&#39;t be. It can&#39;t be.
[1530.48s] It&#39;s premature. It can&#39;t be. But it was
[1532.32s] the ultimate time to buy stocks. Where
[1534.559s] are you in this camp? Like V-shaped
[1536.159s] recovery, Wshaped recovery, a recovery.
[1538.88s] Yeah, we&#39;re looking at two things. First
[1540.48s] off, the dumb money is the new smart
[1542.08s] money. They&#39;ve been buying in the hole
[1543.44s] while hedge funds have been record
[1544.64s] sellers in the hole. We&#39;re looking at
[1546.24s] 2018 that the trade war 1.0. You got a
[1549.2s] 20% correction. You are at new highs
[1551.12s] within four months. That&#39;s the V-shaped
[1552.799s] recovery. That&#39;s a possibility still. It
[1554.64s] started with a tweet. It could end with
[1555.919s] a tweet. Imagine you got a tweet
[1557.12s] tomorrow. Just got off the phone with my
[1558.799s] friend Xi Jinping. You know, we&#39;re we&#39;re
[1560.88s] off to the races. The other one is 2011,
[1563.12s] the European debt crisis. You had the
[1564.72s] 20% correction like we just had. Uh but
[1567.039s] you had three months of non-stop
[1569.039s] volatility and it took eight months to
[1571.039s] reach new highs. So, you&#39;re using these
[1572.96s] opportunities. you&#39;re being smart to
[1574.24s] selectively buy buy highquality
[1576.159s] companies on red day. So I want to get
[1578.08s] your thoughts on that. I want to follow
[1579.2s] up on that because there are different
[1580.799s] types of bare markets, right?
[1583.2s] Structural, cyclical, event driven.
[1585.84s] Structural are ones that last the
[1587.52s] longest are the ones that are hardest.
[1589.2s] They have the the longest length, the
[1591.52s] longest time to recover. Event usually
[1593.84s] go down the least uh the shortest period
[1596.24s] of time and they recover pretty quickly.
[1597.76s] I don&#39;t know what to call this. I don&#39;t
[1599.52s] even know what this category is that
[1601.039s] we&#39;re in right now. I think this is
[1602.559s] event driven because we&#39;re going to
[1603.84s] shift from this. We&#39;re going to start to
[1605.12s] get packages like Kevin Hasset said this
[1606.88s] morning of multiple countries at once
[1609.039s] and then we&#39;re going to shift to tax
[1610.64s] cuts, deregulation, and growth. Right
[1612.4s] now, we&#39;re paying the piper in a in
[1614.32s] another few weeks, another few months,
[1615.679s] we&#39;re going to be talking about growth,
[1616.84s] acceleration, recovery, and everything
[1618.88s] else. I was reading where you tell
[1620.32s] investor, you&#39;re telling investors,
[1621.76s] focus on what you can control. Yeah.
[1623.84s] What can they control? Yeah. I I I
[1626.0s] learned early on in the business, good
[1627.84s] things happen to people who buy
[1629.2s] highquality companies at low prices. And
[1631.44s] that&#39;s all you can do right now. On
[1632.64s] every red day, you look for an
[1634.159s] opportunity to buy great businesses. You
[1635.84s] know, last week, Boeing got down to $130
[1638.96s] a share. Disney got down to $85 a share.
[1641.52s] These are down more than 50% from their
[1643.52s] peaks. These are things you can go to
[1645.12s] bed, wake up, not even having to worry
[1646.88s] about. You got two new ideas,
[1649.64s] Sarxo. I don&#39;t think a lot of folks are
[1651.679s] familiar with this one. This is Brad
[1653.279s] Jacobs new rollup. It&#39;s a building
[1655.039s] supply company. This guy knows how to
[1656.559s] make money for shareholders. If you had
[1658.08s] invested $1 million with him and when he
[1659.84s] did URI, you made $74 million to date.
[1662.88s] If you had done the same exact thing
[1664.32s] with QXO in 2009, you made $160 million.
[1668.88s] So, we&#39;ve got 4 million units housing
[1671.36s] shortage in the US. Donald Trump has
[1673.2s] said, &quot;We&#39;re opening up federal lands.
[1674.88s] Not only do you get your starter home
[1676.24s] from KB Homes, you get an endangered elk
[1678.08s] in the backyard free of charge.&quot; They
[1679.919s] are going to be supplying. They just did
[1681.279s] beacon roofing supply. They paid 10
[1683.12s] times Ibida. He&#39;s going to double that
[1685.039s] IBIDA with with technology, with tuck in
[1687.24s] acquisitions. This is one you buy, you
[1689.76s] tuck away for five to 10 years, and
[1691.36s] you&#39;re gonna wind up with an eight to10
[1692.799s] bagger. And comtock. Comtock we gave on
[1695.12s] your show January of 2024 around $9.
[1698.24s] It&#39;s now up double. We think it can
[1699.76s] double again. Why? Part of the
[1701.52s] negotiations with the EU are going to be
[1703.679s] about we&#39;ll lower your tariffs. You&#39;re
[1705.679s] going to take all of our LNG. Uh Jerry
[1708.0s] Jones owns 70% of this stock. The
[1710.399s] unproved reserves are worth another $20
[1712.64s] a share. We like this here. I love how
[1714.799s] thorough your work is. Thank you so
[1716.08s] much. Track record ain&#39;t bad either.
[1718.08s] Good stuff. We needed you today as well,
[1719.679s] Thomas. Hold on there. All right, folks.
[1721.2s] So, trade uncertainty. Uh, we came out
[1723.44s] the gate strong. Then a New York Fed
[1724.96s] came out with their inflation data. We
[1726.32s] gave a lot of it away. And then a Fed
[1728.0s] chair, a Fed spokesperson rather, spoke
[1730.24s] up. Pretty highly uh recognized Fed
[1733.12s] spokesperson. Now, you can see some more
[1735.2s] green on the screen. We&#39;re bouncing all
[1736.96s] around. But is this the moment that you
[1739.679s] go for it? That you take to your shop?
[1741.36s] Particularly on those tech names. We&#39;ve
[1742.559s] got a very special tech guest next.
[1744.48s] We&#39;ll be right back.
[1747.1s] [Music]
[1755.12s] And then uh then the next morning on
[1758.48s] Tuesday, I had the pleasure to join in
[1760.799s] person Stu Vanney and talk about the
[1763.52s] administration. That this one&#39;s worth uh
[1766.08s] you got to check it out. Want to thank
[1767.84s] again Christian Dagger and Stuart Vney.
[1770.559s] Thank you very much indeed. Tom Hayes is
[1772.399s] joining us this morning to cover the
[1773.919s] market for us. Tom, welcome to New York.
[1776.24s] It it seems the market depends almost
[1778.399s] entirely on tariff
[1780.679s] news every day. Give the latest tariff
[1783.679s] news and then you get the market
[1784.72s] reaction to it. Can we go up? Can the
[1787.2s] market go up if we&#39;re consider
[1788.96s] continually whipsed by tariff news?
[1791.919s] There is uncertainty. But I I just want
[1793.44s] to say about the Chinese rejecting
[1795.12s] Boeing aircraft is like a diabetic
[1797.2s] rejecting insulin. They need our planes
[1799.44s] more more than we need their sales.
[1801.279s] That&#39;s for sure. I think look in the
[1803.36s] kingdom of the blind, the oneeyed man is
[1804.96s] king, okay? The countries that come to
[1807.12s] the table first and sign the deals first
[1810.08s] are going to have certainty. There is an
[1812.48s] enormous premium on certainty for your
[1814.96s] economy. That&#39;s on the one side. On the
[1817.2s] other side, Kevin has it was on the
[1818.799s] network saying, &quot;We&#39;ve got bundles of
[1821.039s] deals.&quot; Well, the administration needs
[1822.88s] to take yes for an answer because the
[1825.6s] minute we take yes for an answer, it
[1827.919s] shows that we&#39;re ready to do business.
[1829.36s] We don&#39;t need to have self-inflicted
[1831.279s] pain. What we need is some certainty
[1833.2s] with the deals so we can get focused on
[1835.44s] earnings, growth, and tax cuts. Yeah. If
[1838.88s] we if we get tax cuts and we get some
[1842.159s] certainty on tariffs, if we do, you got
[1844.96s] a market that goes straight up, do we?
[1846.799s] That&#39;s right. You know what? The market
[1848.48s] is a discounting mechanism. The minute
[1850.48s] we see those bundles of deals come
[1852.32s] across the tape, companies can start to
[1854.559s] give guidance. Once companies can give
[1856.72s] guidance, we have some level of
[1858.08s] certainty and there are a lot of
[1859.6s] tremendous bargains in the market right
[1861.039s] now. Money is going to want to go to
[1862.88s] work as we get a little bit more
[1864.32s] certainty. All right, Tom, thanks very
[1865.84s] much for analyzing the market this
[1867.2s] morning. We appreciate it. Thanks for
[1868.24s] having me.
[1870.24s] And we&#39;re back. And then on Wednesday
[1873.52s] morning, I had the pleasure to join
[1875.76s] Diane King Hall on Schwab Network. Want
[1878.72s] to thank Heidi Schultz and Ally Thompson
[1881.679s] for having me on. This was a great one.
[1883.84s] really enjoyed talking with Diane as
[1885.679s] always. So we had a lot of volatility
[1888.399s] last week. This feels like a little bit
[1890.159s] more normaly now or at least trying to
[1893.52s] kind of figure out how do we get back to
[1895.679s] normal. Um you pointed out that this is
[1898.72s] the first correction where seasoned pros
[1901.6s] seem more fearful than retail investors.
[1904.96s] Um I&#39;m surprised to hear that. But how
[1908.48s] did you arrive at that assessment? Yeah,
[1910.88s] well incoming phone calls. I mean, I
[1913.12s] have peers in the business that were
[1915.2s] calling me in literally abject fear and
[1918.159s] me kind of walking them off the ledge
[1919.6s] and saying, &quot;This too shall pass.&quot; You
[1921.279s] know, if you look at the data, uh,
[1924.159s] retail investors have actually been
[1926.72s] buying in the hole on this correction
[1929.6s] and hedge funds have had record selling
[1932.559s] in the hole. And what&#39;s interesting
[1933.919s] about that, most people say, &quot;Well, the
[1935.6s] dumb money smart money.&quot; Let me tell you
[1937.12s] something. The retail investors have
[1939.36s] been right since co they have been
[1941.84s] buying weakness while professionals have
[1943.76s] been selling weakness and the retail
[1946.0s] investors have been correct and I think
[1947.36s] this is going to be the case again. But
[1949.12s] was some of that fear warranted? I&#39;m not
[1951.44s] saying one should feed into fear but
[1953.84s] like when we saw that volatility last
[1956.24s] week obviously we&#39;ve cooled since then
[1958.24s] on volatility when we look at the VIX
[1960.159s] it&#39;s not at those historic levels that
[1962.159s] we saw.
[1963.48s] Um, but you know, when you&#39;re in this
[1966.559s] daily, you&#39;ve experienced that
[1968.08s] turbulence before, it does kind of
[1970.0s] trigger it triggers a a memory that
[1973.679s] wasn&#39;t great. That&#39;s right. That&#39;s
[1975.519s] right. Look, the the administration has
[1977.76s] to learn to take yes for an answer.
[1979.84s] Okay. They have deals on the table or as
[1982.399s] Kevin Hasset would say bundles of deals
[1984.48s] on the table and all they need what you
[1986.88s] need to see is one credible deal roll
[1989.679s] across the tape and then the market will
[1991.919s] realize there&#39;s some rationality in the
[1994.36s] administration. They&#39;re going to move
[1996.08s] ahead. Things are going to be okay. Uh
[1998.159s] we&#39;re just in the period of uncertainty
[1999.6s] and the way that you get through that is
[2001.679s] you focus on what you can control and
[2004.64s] all you can control is buying high
[2006.399s] quality businesses when they&#39;re on sale.
[2008.0s] I learned very early in the business,
[2010.159s] good things happen to people who buy
[2011.84s] highquality assets when they&#39;re marked
[2013.519s] down. And you know,
[2016.32s] irrespective of how long it takes to get
[2018.399s] a deal, if it takes So here&#39;s two two
[2020.64s] analoges. Trump 1.0 in 2018, trade war
[2024.559s] market corrected 20%. It recovered
[2027.36s] Vshape within 4 months to new highs.
[2030.0s] Could that happen? That&#39;s a possibility.
[2032.24s] We&#39;re slightly more in the camp. It&#39;s
[2034.64s] going to be like the 2011 European debt
[2037.6s] cris where you had a 20% correction and
[2040.159s] then three months of hell non-stop
[2042.64s] volatility and then 8 months later you
[2045.039s] were at new highs. Really quickly, I
[2046.24s] know you&#39;ve got a couple of uh picks,
[2048.0s] but I want to ask you that point about
[2049.96s] volatility. Although we&#39;re not at that
[2052.56s] level that we saw last week, which
[2054.8s] reminded people included of the uh GFC.
[2058.96s] Um, is volatility here to stay or at
[2061.44s] least during this presidential term?
[2063.599s] Yeah. Uh, well, the the history of
[2065.839s] President Trump is volatility followed
[2069.359s] by upside resolution. And that&#39;s his
[2072.0s] formula. He knows how to push it to the
[2073.679s] edge and then break through and the
[2075.44s] market resolves higher. So, I think you
[2076.96s] just have to on a company by company
[2078.72s] basis buy quality that you don&#39;t have to
[2081.599s] worry about, not speculative stocks. and
[2084.24s] we&#39;re going to find we wake up one
[2085.52s] morning and he says, &quot;I just spoke to my
[2087.919s] good friend Xihinping and the market&#39;s
[2090.079s] up 5,000 points.&quot; He does call his good
[2092.32s] friend. I mean, it&#39;s an interesting
[2094.159s] characterization there. But, okay, let&#39;s
[2096.24s] talk about your picks. Um, especially
[2098.56s] given your views on how you want to buy
[2101.76s] things, where you see opportunity,
[2103.52s] potential sale. CRK is on your list.
[2106.4s] Comtock Resources. Now, you picked this
[2109.52s] a year ago or a little more than a year
[2111.2s] ago, right? It&#39;s been a winner since
[2112.64s] then, up more than 100%. Um, why are you
[2116.56s] still bullish? Where do you see it
[2117.92s] going? I think part of the tariff
[2120.56s] negotiations is particularly with Europe
[2123.119s] is going to be you want a reduction in
[2124.64s] tariffs. You need to take all of our
[2126.4s] LNG. Okay. They need our LG. We have it
[2129.28s] in abundance. They need to take it. And
[2131.28s] they&#39;re going to want to do that deal.
[2132.72s] Uh, Comtock Resources, 70% owned by
[2135.119s] Jerry Jones, who owns the Cowboys. uh
[2137.52s] the proved reserves that they report to
[2139.44s] the SEC which is 10 years of drilling
[2141.68s] are worth about uh $8 billion. The
[2144.24s] enterprise value is around $8 billion.
[2146.72s] However, their unproved reserves which
[2148.88s] they do not report uh is another 15
[2151.599s] years of drilling. Okay. So, we think
[2153.68s] that&#39;s worth um about $10 billion which
[2157.52s] means we think not only it doubled since
[2159.52s] we talked about it, we think it can
[2161.2s] double one more time over the next 12 to
[2163.04s] 24 months. Is there still a push for LG
[2166.0s] given the Trump administration&#39;s uh not
[2170.0s] the same focus on converting to more
[2174.2s] um I&#39;m finding I&#39;m trying to find the
[2176.56s] word how you care I mean it&#39;s considered
[2178.96s] a better better for the environment. Uh
[2182.079s] that&#39;s a good question. You mean he&#39;d
[2183.92s] prefer coal?
[2186.48s] Well you look you can&#39;t make it up.
[2187.92s] Well, I think he wants everything and
[2189.119s] we&#39;re going to need everything to power
[2190.48s] the data centers, to power the increased
[2192.56s] demand, whether it&#39;s EVs, whether it&#39;s
[2194.32s] data centers, uh, unlimited demand and
[2196.88s] globally unlimited demand. So, that&#39;s a
[2198.56s] great way to play it. Okay, your next
[2199.92s] ticker, QXO. Now, look, that&#39;s a
[2202.8s] different pick than this in terms of its
[2204.839s] performance. Uh, I mean, with Comtock
[2208.24s] Resources, that&#39;s outperformed the S&amp;P
[2210.0s] 500 uh this day. But QXO, this seems
[2213.44s] like a little bit of a Where does it go?
[2215.839s] Yeah, this is a relatively new position
[2217.68s] for us. This is Brad Jacobs. Brad Jacobs
[2220.079s] is a winner. He makes money for
[2221.68s] shareholders. If you had invested a
[2223.28s] million bucks with him when he started
[2225.119s] United Rentals in 1997 when he got
[2227.839s] involved, you&#39;re up 70 some odd, 74x,
[2231.04s] $74 million. If you did
[2234.28s] XPO logistics in 2009, he came in, he
[2237.599s] put 150 million bucks of his own money,
[2239.52s] bought stock, you&#39;re up 160%, 1 million
[2242.88s] became 160 million. Now he&#39;s doing a
[2244.56s] roll up. Same formula, different
[2246.56s] industry in building products. You got
[2250.0s] 75 million millennials, 34. They want to
[2252.64s] buy houses. They can&#39;t afford them. So
[2254.64s] Besson&#39;s going to deregulate banks,
[2256.8s] bring down Treasury yields below uh 4%.
[2260.24s] Okay? Hopefully the good way. Not
[2261.68s] through not through a recession, but the
[2263.28s] good way. Uh that will make housing
[2265.52s] affordable. And Trump is opening, you
[2267.359s] know, we got 500 million acres of
[2268.96s] federal land. He&#39;s opening that up to
[2271.04s] build all these starter homes. So KB
[2272.88s] Homes will build your starter home. You
[2274.48s] get an endangered elk free of charge in
[2276.24s] your backyard. And Brad Jacobs is going
[2279.359s] to provide all of the building supplies.
[2282.4s] He&#39;s going to do a rollup. He&#39;s going to
[2283.76s] add technology. He started with Beacon
[2286.32s] Roofing Supply. When your roof is
[2288.0s] leaking, it&#39;s a non-discretionary
[2289.599s] expense. You don&#39;t think about should we
[2291.44s] buy a new roof? You have to buy a new
[2293.68s] roof. I mean, you could patch it, but
[2295.28s] yeah. Yeah. So, the history of Brad
[2297.2s] Jacobs is you put money in, you don&#39;t
[2299.76s] think about it for 5 to 10 years. And
[2302.16s] this will be 5, six, seven bagger. Uh,
[2305.119s] at the least, and if history is any
[2306.88s] prologue, it&#39;ll be a lot more than that.
[2308.56s] Okay. Potentially a 10 bagger, I think.
[2310.64s] So, I&#39;d always bet on Brad Jacobs. He is
[2313.28s] serious. He wrote a book, How to Make a
[2315.599s] Few Billion. That&#39;s pretty useful
[2317.359s] because he actually made a few billion
[2318.8s] dollars. All right.
[2330.72s] And last, but certainly not least, I
[2332.72s] really enjoyed this interview with
[2333.92s] Kristen Scher on NYSE Live. Want to
[2337.119s] thank Kristen, obviously, and Mel
[2339.88s] Montana. No relation to Tony Montana
[2343.76s] from Scarface whatsoever. Mel is
[2345.839s] fantastic. Mel and uh Kristen are the
[2348.48s] dream team. We&#39;ll listen in here.
[2350.16s] Welcome back to NYC TV Live, everyone.
[2352.079s] I&#39;m Christine Scherer here in studio.
[2353.92s] Well, stocks are looking at a negative
[2356.24s] open after what was a muted action
[2358.72s] yesterday and of course two straight
[2360.64s] days of gains for the S&amp;P before that.
[2363.2s] Well, joining me now with more on where
[2365.119s] we&#39;re headed from here and how investors
[2368.0s] should respond to all of this is Thomas
[2369.68s] Hayes. He&#39;s a chair and managing member
[2371.359s] at Great Hill Capital. Uh Thomas, always
[2373.68s] great to have you. Great to be here,
[2375.04s] Kristen. All right, so what do you make
[2376.56s] of all this market action of late? Uh
[2378.48s] you want the good news or the bad news?
[2379.92s] Let&#39;s start with the good news. Okay.
[2381.44s] Okay. Well, the good news is the same as
[2382.8s] the bad news, and that&#39;s everyone is
[2384.16s] pessimistic. Okay. So, you saw the fund
[2386.48s] manager survey from Bank of America this
[2388.4s] week. Uh, highest expectations of a
[2391.599s] recession, fourth highest uh in 20
[2393.92s] years. So, we&#39;re talking about 2022,
[2396.56s] we&#39;re talking about 2020, we&#39;re talking
[2398.56s] about 2009. Uh, most number of managers
[2402.079s] wanting to go underweight US equities.
[2404.96s] So, usually that&#39;s a wash out. And what
[2407.119s] we&#39;re seeing is the quote unquote dumb
[2409.359s] money is now the new smart money. Retail
[2411.68s] investors have been buying a ton of
[2413.359s] stock on this weakness. Hedge funds have
[2415.359s] been recordelling in the hole and oddly
[2418.56s] enough retail investors have been right
[2420.16s] since co. So let&#39;s talk about what these
[2423.359s] tariffs mean for companies and and how
[2425.44s] companies might respond to them. Of
[2427.28s] course we&#39;re at the beginning of earning
[2428.88s] season. Thomas, what&#39;s your expectation
[2431.119s] especially when it comes to guidance?
[2432.96s] That&#39;s the big deal. I mean the big
[2434.88s] problem is companies can&#39;t guide in this
[2437.92s] period of uncertainty and uh Kevin
[2440.32s] Hasset was was on one of the networks
[2442.24s] yesterday uh or two days ago now saying
[2445.04s] we have bundles of deals with amazing
[2447.359s] terms. Well my message to the
[2448.8s] administration is how about taking yes
[2450.56s] for an answer. Uh you saw Vietnam come
[2452.8s] to the table and they said we&#39;ll do zero
[2454.32s] tariffs if you do zero tariffs. I
[2456.079s] understand there&#39;s uh non-tariff
[2458.0s] barriers, but what the answer should
[2459.76s] have been was we accept in principle
[2462.72s] contingent upon working out the
[2464.88s] non-tariff barriers. Instead, they did
[2466.88s] not. And what happened? China went to
[2468.56s] visit Vietnam and they just inked a
[2470.079s] deal. So, you snooze, you lose. I think
[2472.48s] the administration has a lot of good
[2474.48s] things going. They should book one deal
[2478.079s] and that&#39;s going to give companies more
[2479.92s] certainty to say, &quot;Hey, here are our
[2482.0s] three guidance scenarios. If they
[2483.52s] continue to do deals, good things are
[2485.04s] going to happen. And if they don&#39;t,
[2486.16s] medium things are going to happen. And
[2487.52s] if they really don&#39;t, here are the bad
[2489.2s] things that could happen. And then the
[2490.56s] market can kind of get their hands
[2492.4s] around it. But right now, we&#39;re just
[2493.839s] shooting in the wind. So we are probably
[2496.56s] down still about, let&#39;s say, 14% roughly
[2499.599s] on the S&amp;P 500 from a recent high. Do
[2503.04s] you think it is rangebound until we get
[2504.96s] a little bit more certainty? Yeah, we
[2506.72s] have two frameworks. One would be Trump
[2508.88s] tariff war 1.0. In 2018, you had a 20%
[2512.8s] correction. Yes. And then you were at
[2514.72s] new highs four months later. That&#39;s a
[2516.48s] possibility. We would love that. Uh the
[2518.72s] second scenario that we&#39;re looking at is
[2520.56s] the 2011 European debt crisis. 20%
[2523.599s] correction and then 3 months of hell,
[2526.4s] choppy volatility. Even though the
[2528.16s] bottom was kind of in marginal new lows,
[2530.72s] it was literally up and down every day
[2532.16s] for three months of uncertainty until
[2534.16s] Mario Draghy came out and said, &quot;We&#39;ll
[2535.839s] do whatever it takes.&quot; So, we need one
[2538.079s] of those moments. So either way, but
[2539.76s] even in that case, eight months later,
[2541.68s] we were at new highs. So I learned early
[2543.839s] in the business, Kristen, good things
[2545.52s] happen to people who buy highquality
[2547.28s] businesses when they&#39;re marked down. And
[2548.72s] I think this time will be no different.
[2550.319s] What are some of the high quality names,
[2551.839s] Thomas, that are on your radar? Yeah, I
[2553.68s] think number one, don&#39;t give up on
[2555.76s] PayPal. Everyone is down on PayPal. It&#39;s
[2557.92s] kind of round trip. It shot up to 90.
[2559.68s] Everyone&#39;s like, &quot;Woo, we&#39;re up 50%.&quot;
[2561.76s] Now it&#39;s back down in the 60s. They&#39;re
[2564.48s] generating recordfree cash flow. 7.5
[2567.839s] billion. They&#39;ll probably do 7.5 8
[2569.28s] billion. They&#39;re going to buy back 20%
[2571.119s] of the company in the next 2 years. Alex
[2573.28s] Chris came from into it. He ran 50% of
[2575.68s] the revenues. He had a 30 bagger while
[2577.76s] he was uh running the small business
[2579.76s] division there. He&#39;s going to do the
[2581.44s] same things for PayPal. PayPal&#39;s down
[2583.28s] because EU said, &quot;Oh, you&#39;re going to
[2584.96s] tariff us. We&#39;re going to tariff your
[2586.4s] processors.&quot; And people shoot first, ask
[2588.48s] questions later. The fact of the matter
[2590.079s] is the deal is going to be very simple
[2591.599s] with the EU. You take our LNG, we&#39;ll
[2593.92s] lower your tariffs. They won&#39;t tariff
[2596.64s] our processors. All will be well. Alex
[2598.88s] Chris is going to run this up up the
[2600.319s] flag pole. You see Will Ferrell on the
[2602.4s] TV commercials. They&#39;re rocking and
[2603.76s] rolling. They&#39;ve got 430 million active
[2606.4s] users. This is a huge business. Every
[2608.16s] time you take an Uber, that&#39;s actually
[2609.52s] PayPal. You don&#39;t even know it. It&#39;s
[2610.8s] called Brainree. Interesting. Yeah. Uh
[2613.119s] another energy company I know has been
[2614.8s] on your radar for a while as well.
[2616.96s] What&#39;s the latest on that? Yeah. So,
[2618.64s] Comtock Resources, uh it&#39;s it&#39;s a double
[2620.88s] since we started talking about it. Uh
[2623.119s] that&#39;s over a year ago. We think it can
[2624.96s] double again. And here&#39;s why. 8 billion
[2627.04s] enterprise value. The proved reserves
[2629.44s] PV10 that they have to report to the SEC
[2631.76s] 10 years of drilling is worth about 78
[2634.319s] billion. So that&#39;s good. Um there the
[2637.839s] unproved reserves which they don&#39;t have
[2639.52s] to report is about 15 years of drilling.
[2641.28s] We estimate that&#39;s worth about $10
[2643.0s] billion. Uh so we think it can double
[2645.2s] one more time from here. And it&#39;s
[2647.359s] perfectly in line with the Trump
[2648.72s] administration initiatives of drill baby
[2651.04s] drill, massive energy, powering the data
[2653.359s] centers, and now of course servicing
[2655.44s] Europe. Yeah. I do want to ask Thomas
[2657.359s] the lessons from 2018. I think there are
[2659.44s] real questions out there. You know,
[2661.119s] obviously the president can call shots
[2663.2s] at warp speed, but for an entire supply
[2665.44s] chain to adjust to that and consumers,
[2667.839s] you know, they obviously can&#39;t act as
[2669.68s] quickly as the president uh we presume.
[2672.24s] Yeah. So, what are those lessons learned
[2674.56s] from 2018 that might apply to this
[2676.64s] scenario today? Yeah. The the lessons of
[2679.04s] Trump 1.0 and and 2018 are uh excess
[2683.92s] volatility followed by resolution to the
[2686.0s] upside. That&#39;s the way he rolls. So, he
[2688.64s] throws out these grenades and everyone
[2691.04s] ducks for cover and then when he
[2693.359s] realizes there&#39;s enough pain, he goes in
[2695.68s] and he fixes the problem. And I think
[2697.359s] what you&#39;re going to see is as you see
[2699.839s] one, two, three tape bombs, look, you&#39;re
[2701.68s] going to wake up one morning, everyone&#39;s
[2702.88s] pessimistic, and you&#39;re going to see a
[2704.64s] beautiful truth or tweet, whatever he
[2706.24s] wants to call it, it&#39;s going to say, &quot;I
[2707.68s] just got off the phone with my good
[2709.2s] friend Xihinping, and the market&#39;s up
[2711.04s] 5,000 points, and you&#39;re you&#39;re stuck,
[2712.88s] you know, in cash, and you say, &quot;I
[2714.96s] missed it.&quot; So, I think it&#39;s selective
[2716.56s] buying. It&#39;s not wholesale buying. It
[2718.0s] could take longer than we expect. Deal
[2719.68s] with the volatility as it relates to
[2721.2s] supply chains. We just need to see one
[2723.359s] deal hit the tape and then they can get
[2724.72s] a little more comfort. There&#39;s some
[2726.16s] rationality. We can slowly move ahead,
[2728.4s] but yes, people are slightly on pause
[2730.24s] and that will have an impact in economic
[2732.0s] numbers in the first couple of quarters
[2733.359s] for sure. All right, Thomas Hayes, he&#39;s
[2735.28s] a chair and managing member of Great
[2736.64s] Hill Capital joining us in studio.
[2738.4s] Thomas, thank you. Thank you, Kristen.
[2739.76s] It&#39;s great to have you. And we&#39;re back.
[2742.16s] Let&#39;s get down to
[2745.16s] um want to actually talk about
[2748.16s] something. You know, people have been
[2750.079s] asking me about gold.
[2752.8s] Uh I am hearing rumors that you know
[2758.48s] we&#39;ve
[2759.56s] got we&#39;ve got and by the way do not act
[2762.48s] on any of this because the the same
[2765.2s] places it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s slightly better
[2767.359s] than a coin flip. I think it seems a
[2769.2s] little premature but if true uh we&#39;d all
[2772.24s] be smiling so wide we could eat three
[2773.839s] bananas sideways. So let&#39;s let&#39;s see
[2775.76s] what happens. Here&#39;s what I&#39;m hearing.
[2778.4s] It&#39;s in line with what I&#39;ve been saying.
[2780.319s] So, it&#39;s not
[2781.8s] news, but um you know, we&#39;ve had 14 days
[2786.48s] since quote unquote liberation day, and
[2789.76s] you know, Hassid and Co have been out
[2791.76s] saying
[2793.15s] [Music]
[2795.16s] um we&#39;ve got, you know, bundles of
[2797.92s] deals, 75 countries begging us for a
[2800.4s] deal, yada yada yada. Good talks with
[2803.04s] Japan, good talks with everyone else.
[2805.359s] All right, so you know, book it. You
[2807.2s] know, what what are you guys waiting
[2808.599s] for? and what they&#39;re waiting for. And
[2812.24s] again, this is just uh you know, maybe a
[2816.4s] hair more than a coin flip probability.
[2818.88s] Uh, I&#39;m hearing that it could be a grand
[2822.48s] package deal that they&#39;re trying to put
[2825.48s] together, which would include
[2829.04s] um tariffs being slashed in exchange
[2832.68s] for one, opening your markets, you know,
[2835.839s] fairly open your markets and remove the
[2838.68s] non tariff
[2840.68s] barriers. Number two, increase your
[2843.119s] defense spending. Number three, invest
[2845.2s] in US manufacturing. Number four, buy
[2848.2s] treasuries. Number five, help contain
[2851.4s] China. Number six, deval potentially
[2854.88s] deval the dollar. Remember, we talked
[2857.92s] multiple times about a potential for a
[2860.4s] Mara Lago accord. And if that proves to
[2865.2s] be true and they&#39;re miraculously able to
[2868.48s] pull it off as quickly as the weekend,
[2871.119s] uh, which who knows? I to me it sounds
[2873.76s] premature and early. Uh could just be
[2877.119s] people that are are
[2879.16s] um uh stuck trying to create rumors to
[2882.64s] get out of positions. But it does rhyme
[2886.319s] with everything that we&#39;ve been kind of
[2888.88s] talking about on this podcast. Gold is
[2891.52s] sniffing that out, the possibility of a
[2893.44s] deval.
[2896.119s] And if that&#39;s the case and they do
[2899.839s] announce something like that, in my
[2902.119s] view, that would probably be the top for
[2904.64s] gold. Obviously, the bottom in the
[2906.319s] market. Um, so just something to
[2912.839s] consider. Not really something you can
[2914.96s] act on because it&#39;s
[2916.76s] not done, okay? And nothing gets done
[2920.16s] until one man says it gets done,
[2921.92s] apparently. So, um, but it would make
[2926.48s] sense why they wouldn&#39;t at least
[2928.72s] announce one or two deals,
[2931.44s] um, when they&#39;ve got so many countries
[2934.0s] coming together. And if that is the
[2936.28s] case, that is a great thing. I&#39;d be a
[2938.96s] little surprised if it was as soon as
[2940.48s] this weekend. It seems like an awful lot
[2941.839s] to get done in a short period of time,
[2944.079s] but I&#39;d be open to it, let me tell you
[2946.64s] that. And uh and for all the clients
[2949.2s] that are in, by the way, congratulations
[2950.72s] to everyone who came in. Congratulations
[2952.88s] to all the new clients. We we named a
[2954.8s] bunch of them last week, all the
[2956.4s] existing clients who put money in in
[2958.88s] when it was down the most last uh
[2961.28s] Tuesday and Monday after we did our
[2963.28s] special private client call. Um and uh
[2967.359s] and new clients that came in over the
[2969.119s] transom uh in time for our closing on
[2971.76s] Saturday. So, super job and uh that&#39;s
[2975.76s] kind of the good news. You can probably
[2978.079s] leave it there and go watch football
[2979.52s] games now and uh color Easter eggs for
[2981.839s] your kids. But uh let&#39;s let&#39;s go back to
[2985.319s] the S&amp;P 500 because again, when
[2990.24s] fundamentals are thrown out the window,
[2992.079s] you have to look a little bit at
[2994.359s] technicals. And um let&#39;s take a look. If
[2998.24s] you recall, we talked about a quote
[3000.24s] unquote double bottom. I had to walk my
[3002.48s] friend off the ledge the other week. Um
[3005.76s] and uh and quite a few others, by the
[3007.839s] way. Uh but that&#39;s okay. You know,
[3010.24s] that&#39;s that&#39;s what bottoms look like.
[3012.88s] And uh even the best have have reason to
[3016.079s] get scared because it&#39;s man-made. You
[3018.48s] can&#39;t handicap it. It&#39;s not years of
[3020.319s] build up and then you can say, &quot;Oh,
[3021.44s] okay. It&#39;ll take, you know, 24 months
[3023.28s] and we&#39;ll be back at new highs.&quot; So,
[3024.48s] when it&#39;s man-made, a tweet creates it.
[3026.8s] A tweet can solve it. And
[3031.599s] or an accord or a grand package
[3033.76s] overnight. And if you&#39;re caught
[3035.2s] flatfooted in cash or whatever, you just
[3038.0s] you can never get it back because you
[3039.92s] wake up and it&#39;s too late. So, um, so
[3043.839s] this double bottom is still holding. I
[3045.76s] think last week we were kind of here and
[3047.92s] everyone was despondent. Then we started
[3049.52s] to rise. People got a little happier.
[3051.119s] Yesterday, pulled back, but in the
[3053.359s] scheme of things, didn&#39;t really pull
[3054.8s] that much. This is still holding for
[3056.72s] now. Everyone is looking for the retest.
[3059.599s] Maybe we get it, maybe we don&#39;t. If we
[3061.359s] get that if we get that package over the
[3063.04s] weekend again, probably a coin flip,
[3065.119s] maybe a little more than a coin flip,
[3066.96s] then we&#39;re there&#39;s no way we&#39;re going
[3068.88s] back here. If we don&#39;t get it, uh, that
[3071.04s] wouldn&#39;t surprise me. And it could be
[3072.559s] the 2011 scenario we discussed, three
[3075.04s] months of hell, chop, most of the pain&#39;s
[3077.599s] in, but you just like just wait killing
[3080.64s] time for three months until they get
[3082.079s] their act together. Um, or if we get
[3085.68s] this weekend, it could blow at 2018 back
[3088.16s] at new highs within 4 months, which
[3090.24s] would be unbelievably exciting. Uh, so
[3093.76s] I&#39;m just trying to throw this
[3095.04s] perspective out. Uh, literally, by the
[3098.079s] way, off the plane late last night,
[3099.76s] super early out here in California. So,
[3103.119s] if I sound like I&#39;m on a lot of
[3104.559s] caffeine, um, you&#39;re perceptive. Let&#39;s
[3107.76s] just leave it at that. Put call Trin by
[3112.559s] the way taking the girls and Caitlyn and
[3114.72s] I are taking the girls to Hawaii on
[3118.079s] Friday tomorrow for a week. So we&#39;ll do
[3121.28s] it how I like to. I&#39;m going to play a
[3123.28s] lot of incredible courses. Uh half day
[3126.16s] work, half day play. Girls have been
[3128.16s] wanting to go to Hawaii forever. And
[3129.839s] apparently on the West Coast, Hawaii is
[3132.24s] the Caribbean. Uh as we relate to it on
[3134.64s] the east coast, I guess Cabo and and
[3136.4s] Hawaii are the Caribbean like we have on
[3138.079s] the east coast. So very excited to show
[3140.079s] them that. Haven&#39;t been there. Caitlyn
[3142.8s] and I were there before we got married.
[3144.319s] So my goodness, 17 18 years ago. That&#39;s
[3147.04s] uh time flies. Uh certainly when you&#39;re
[3149.92s] having fun and uh give Caitlyn credit
[3152.16s] that uh we we have had a lot of fun
[3154.8s] together and uh we&#39;ll we&#39;ll have another
[3157.28s] week of great memories with the kids.
[3159.119s] All right, skew. Uh that&#39;s down. This
[3162.839s] is you know these are when skew is
[3166.319s] washed
[3171.88s] out you know that these are the times
[3175.119s] when you need to worry when skews
[3176.72s] elevated and and we were noting that I
[3179.52s] you know this this this was this was
[3183.44s] likely okay and we talked about that
[3185.839s] buckle up buttercup February March blah
[3187.76s] blah blah this 10% move was likely this
[3191.2s] overshoot has been unlikely, but I think
[3193.599s] it&#39;s going to get resolved relatively
[3195.68s] quickly, like 2018. So, uh, we were kind
[3199.52s] of fine to ride or die. This this was
[3203.64s] unnecessary, to be honest. But all
[3206.48s] things considered, it&#39;s like sending Xi
[3208.559s] the Christmas card, even though he
[3210.16s] doesn&#39;t celebrate Christmas, is is going
[3211.92s] to be sending Trump because we put
[3214.72s] literally record amounts of money to
[3216.4s] work last week. Even more than we put to
[3219.52s] to work in October 2022. And I said last
[3222.96s] week, if you&#39;re on the fence, you need
[3224.64s] to come in because, you know, number
[3227.2s] one, I&#39;ve never asked anyone to invest.
[3228.88s] I&#39;ve always just put out value and and
[3231.2s] good people find me after they see the
[3233.44s] framework, make some some money with my
[3235.28s] ideas or their referrals from existing
[3237.96s] clients. Um, but there were two times in
[3240.48s] my career that I told people, now&#39;s the
[3242.64s] time if you&#39;re on the fence, either put
[3244.96s] more money to work or to come in fresh.
[3247.44s] One was October 2022 and uh one was last
[3251.119s] week uh and and in this range right now.
[3254.96s] So, um so there&#39;s that. Let&#39;s see how it
[3257.68s] plays out. Uh I know how it plays out
[3260.64s] the long term. How does it play out in
[3262.079s] the next few days or few weeks or few
[3263.76s] months? Uh we covered the different
[3265.92s] scenarios last week. You can see some
[3267.599s] great companies on sale. You know,
[3269.599s] Chevron getting knocked down. That&#39;s
[3271.28s] probably getting interesting. Nike, same
[3273.76s] story. Disney,
[3276.28s] um
[3278.28s] Intel, you know, all this stuff. Once
[3280.88s] you get an announcement, the whole
[3283.359s] framework of investor thinking is going
[3285.359s] to change and it&#39;s going to change super
[3287.68s] super fast. Um, so just enjoy the buy 1
[3291.52s] get one free sales and one day you wake
[3294.0s] up, I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s Monday or five
[3296.64s] Mondays from now or 12 Mondays from now,
[3299.359s] but um, you know, the Intel&#39;s I mean
[3302.88s] this is these are the environments that
[3305.2s] I absolutely live for. Okay. So, want to
[3308.48s] thank we I think I&#39;ve got the Sloomer
[3310.16s] put somewhere else. So, that we&#39;ll get
[3312.079s] to that in a minute. Uh, thanks Steve
[3314.559s] for just sending this over. This is
[3317.48s] Albamaro and we&#39;ve covered the overlay
[3321.599s] of
[3327.16s] um lithium prices to Albamaro in the
[3330.319s] past. They got 3.5 billion of excess
[3332.319s] liquidity to ride or die. Um,
[3336.359s] and this is the when Albamaro&#39;s dividend
[3340.4s] yield gets around 3%, the stock price
[3342.72s] tends to bottom. And that&#39;s exactly
[3344.8s] where we are right now. And my response
[3346.64s] to Steve was we don&#39;t own enough. And,
[3349.52s] you know, at some point you have
[3350.88s] position limits. You know, there&#39;s we we
[3354.72s] own enough, but you never own enough
[3356.559s] once it starts turning, you know, and
[3358.16s] that that&#39;s just the way it works. Uh,
[3359.839s] so thanks Steve D on that. Yurian Timmer
[3362.559s] been at Fidelity for 40 some odd years.
[3365.599s] He had an interesting tweet. Easy to
[3367.599s] forget just how many 20% draw downs
[3369.599s] we&#39;ve had just in the last five years.
[3371.52s] We had a 28% decline in 2022, 35% in
[3375.16s] 2020, 30 uh 20% in 2018. In other words,
[3379.599s] every two years the market suffers a
[3381.44s] large draw down and it has come back
[3383.2s] every time, sometimes quickly and
[3384.64s] sometimes slowly. So that&#39;s just putting
[3386.4s] things in perspective. returns after 15%
[3388.559s] draw downs from Rit Holtz.
[3391.88s] Um, one year later, uh, 83% positivity
[3395.839s] rate up 15%, three years up 40, 5 years
[3398.88s] up 66, 10 years up 158, 185. Uh, this
[3402.799s] isn&#39;t fun, but it happens from Carson
[3404.72s] Research.
[3408.96s] Number of corrections in bare markets
[3410.64s] since World War
[3411.96s] II, 25 of 10 to 20% what we just had.
[3417.04s] Seven of 20 to 30, three of 30 to 40,
[3421.28s] and three of 40% or worse. Foreigners
[3423.92s] selling US equity funds selling in the
[3426.24s] hole just like they did during COVID.
[3428.48s] Really not a good time to sell. China&#39;s
[3430.64s] March lending jumped on government
[3432.0s] stimulus push. That is going to be the
[3433.839s] unintended positive consequence. We&#39;re
[3435.68s] going to cover all the D-listing in
[3436.96s] detail today. Okay, we covered some of
[3438.4s] it in the article, so just chillax. Um,
[3442.88s] energy positioning getting to levels
[3445.359s] where we continue to want to look for
[3447.28s] more. We&#39;re we&#39;re very happy with our
[3448.559s] comm stock as you can tell. Uh, but
[3451.599s] there will be other things to do.
[3452.88s] Historical morning start equity research
[3454.72s] coverage price to fair value estimates
[3457.119s] at uh month end. So they&#39;re trading at
[3461.44s] price to fair value
[3464.24s] uh levels that you really only see uh at
[3469.599s] big drawd downs and and and usually they
[3472.24s] inflect from these levels. So Morning
[3475.599s] Star does a really good job on their
[3476.96s] fair value estimates because they&#39;re
[3478.48s] Buffett accolts. It&#39;s a Midwest firm.
[3480.72s] They&#39;re always there. The founder is
[3482.24s] friends with Buffett, friends with my
[3483.76s] first boss who was friends with Buffett
[3485.28s] for 40 years. So I know all these guys.
[3487.44s] They do really good work. And
[3492.04s] um okay, now we got uh US exceptionalism
[3495.76s] theme, a long way to
[3497.64s] unwind.
[3499.319s] Um yeah, and this has been kind of
[3502.16s] coming into the year. We said XUS, this
[3504.799s] is going to converge. You&#39;re going to
[3506.0s] see outperformance, not doesn&#39;t mean US
[3507.839s] is crashing at all. It just means
[3509.92s] underperformance. Why? Because of mag 7.
[3512.079s] All the themes that we covered in the
[3513.52s] fourth quarter that got you ready to be
[3515.28s] out of Mag Sev before the first quarter
[3517.599s] have played out. International was
[3519.599s] crushing it uh to on a relative basis.
[3522.319s] Some 60 point spread is probably still
[3524.24s] not far from that um outperformance and
[3527.92s] that will come back after any type of
[3529.839s] package is announced. Expectations for
[3532.24s] dollar depreciation highest since March
[3534.16s] May 2006. This was another theme. Dollar
[3536.559s] would continue to weaken. That is
[3538.24s] playing out. Soon as package is
[3539.92s] announced, EM will rebound back quickly.
[3542.799s] Options traders bet on rally to 120.
[3546.24s] That is on the euro relative to the
[3548.88s] dollar. There you go, ladies and
[3550.16s] gentlemen. Uh Chinese exports up ahead
[3553.2s] of US tariff hit. By the way, for all
[3555.2s] the new people, we have a ton of new
[3556.799s] people. you know, my longtime fans and
[3560.16s] uh and um awesome partners here uh know
[3564.72s] all these things that I said three
[3566.559s] months ago, six months ago, etc. You can
[3569.28s] go back to the archives and pull up any
[3571.2s] date and see what we were saying and uh
[3573.52s] kind of how it played out uh at your
[3575.44s] leisure. Chinese exports up ahead of US
[3578.559s] tariff hit. So, a lot of pull forward
[3581.76s] that&#39;s going to help uh obviously helped
[3583.68s] with US car sales as well. help help
[3586.079s] with uh uh Baba&#39;s earnings I&#39;m sure in
[3590.079s] the first quarter. So we we&#39;ll see how
[3592.0s] that works out. 42% say gold is best
[3594.48s] performing asset in 2025. That&#39;s part of
[3597.44s] the reason I think that if they announce
[3598.96s] a grand package and a currency deval
[3601.2s] gold is sniffing that out and uh once
[3603.76s] it&#39;s actually announced by the rumor
[3605.359s] sell the news uh watch out
[3609.72s] below. Record number of fund manager
[3612.48s] surveys intending to cut US equities.
[3614.4s] That&#39;s what they always do in the hole
[3615.839s] at the exact wrong time. Uh record
[3619.04s] two-month rotation out of US stocks.
[3622.079s] That&#39;s probably a theme that will
[3623.44s] persist. Relative value of XUS FMS cash
[3627.28s] surges to 4.8 selling in the whole
[3629.839s] record by re record by hedge funds.
[3632.319s] Retail have been buying retail have been
[3634.0s] right since 2020. Uh COVID S&amp;P liquidity
[3637.92s] has deteriorated recently. That is
[3640.72s] another indication that I think what
[3643.119s] you&#39;re going to have to see is the Fed
[3645.92s] will go back in. They may not cut uh
[3648.72s] right away, but they are going to go
[3650.079s] back into quantitative easing and call
[3652.4s] it something else. Um
[3655.92s] uh to keep the liquidity going unless a
[3658.0s] deal is announced, the liquidity will
[3659.839s] come back naturally. Co total net call
[3662.96s] volume, they couldn&#39;t get enough in
[3664.319s] January. They couldn&#39;t uh you couldn&#39;t
[3667.2s] give them away in April. Well, what does
[3669.52s] that tell you? Historically, last time
[3671.44s] was uh Q4 2022 when you couldn&#39;t give
[3674.559s] them away. That was the best time to buy
[3676.079s] them. So, I don&#39;t know what else to tell
[3678.72s] you, ladies and gentlemen. I mean, this
[3680.319s] stuff is not rocket science. Even though
[3682.48s] value
[3684.04s] stocks, valuations remain, okay, even
[3686.799s] though value stocks have outperformed
[3688.559s] year to date, valuations remain
[3690.559s] significantly attractive. That was one
[3692.16s] of our other themes. The final theme is
[3694.24s] going to be small caps. That hasn&#39;t
[3696.16s] worked yet. It is going to work in
[3698.0s] spades just like the dollar took a
[3699.76s] little longer. Watch out above, not
[3702.72s] below. Uh volatility spikes have been
[3705.2s] opportunities that by the way that
[3706.96s] requires a package that requires tariff
[3708.799s] mitigation. That requires all that. But
[3710.4s] I think it&#39;s coming and uh you know for
[3712.48s] a guy who wants to be on Mount Rushmore,
[3714.319s] if he can pull this thing off,
[3717.4s] um it will be unreal. No one&#39;s been able
[3720.72s] to do it post World War II. Uh so you
[3725.359s] know who knows uh we&#39;ll leave it at
[3727.839s] that. Volatility spikes have been
[3730.839s] opportunities. Uh S&amp;P average forward
[3733.359s] price return 1990 to April
[3736.68s] 2025. Forward periods from when VIX
[3739.2s] level triggered. And that is uh from
[3742.24s] periods when VIX weekly closed above
[3745.16s] 45. And you can see that one year out
[3749.599s] you&#39;re up 34.2%.
[3751.599s] two years out, which point of this chart
[3754.16s] is we just had that uh two years out,
[3756.799s] you&#39;re up 51%, three years out, 50, five
[3759.52s] years out, 112, six years, uh 10 years
[3762.16s] out, 220%. So hang tight, ladies and
[3765.44s] gentlemen. Um inflation expectations,
[3768.96s] highest since June
[3774.44s] 2021. Okay.
[3777.28s] net expecting higher shortterm
[3781.88s] rates. Fascinating. This has a tendency
[3784.96s] to be right and this has a tendency to
[3788.24s] be at or near peak inflation for the
[3790.559s] short term. So that&#39;s fascinating.
[3792.319s] Global model new model
[3795.319s] launches. Oh, for cars. Oh, lot of lot
[3798.88s] of new cars. A lot of exciting cars
[3800.559s] coming out. That&#39;s good to see. Uh
[3802.96s] foreign central bank, which means
[3804.4s] they&#39;re going to flood the lot soon.
[3805.44s] They&#39;ve taken down inventories huge by
[3807.599s] the way in the last few weeks ahead of
[3809.599s] the tariffs. This is going to be such a
[3811.28s] great thing because all you see is
[3812.96s] incentives. So now the
[3815.88s] aptal purchase price has come down
[3819.44s] because of all the incentives and
[3820.64s] because everyone trying to get ahead of
[3822.0s] tariffs once they do a package um the
[3825.76s] incentives are going to be expected and
[3828.079s] the volumes are going to have to
[3829.359s] replenish the thing. So hang in there on
[3832.319s] Cooper Standard. I know some of you are
[3834.079s] getting uh uh your panties in and not
[3836.799s] but uh chillax. We&#39;re going to be okay.
[3839.44s] Uh foreign central bank smart money
[3841.599s] record outflow foreign demand for US
[3843.76s] stocks. So again uh just like they sold
[3847.039s] in the hole at COVID they&#39;re doing the
[3849.599s] exact same thing. Here is one of the
[3852.16s] most volatile weeks in history. uh you
[3855.359s] see the average true range
[3858.799s] uh and uh these
[3862.2s] levels fiveday average uh tend to
[3865.68s] coincide with major
[3868.359s] bottoms. Uh Trump Nvidia commits to
[3873.2s] invest $500 billion uh and then he kind
[3877.2s] of stuck the knife in their back the
[3878.64s] next day. That&#39;s
[3881.119s] uh it&#39;s just the environment we&#39;re in.
[3884.64s] VIX. Can we go wrong buying the S&amp;P 500
[3888.559s] with VIX greater than 50? No. We just
[3892.4s] looked at the data. Great financial
[3894.079s] crisis COVID. That&#39;s the time to be a
[3896.0s] buyer, not a seller. I don&#39;t think it&#39;s
[3897.599s] a wholesale buyer. I think it&#39;s a select
[3900.16s] bespoke
[3902.68s] buyer, but a buyer nonetheless. US
[3905.68s] exceptional theme has peaked. We agree.
[3908.16s] Not because US isn&#39;t the greatest place
[3909.76s] in the world. I think it&#39;s just going to
[3911.039s] be a reversion from seven stocks to 500
[3914.68s] stocks. And the 500 stocks represent
[3918.0s] regular Americans, middle, lower middle
[3920.48s] class, uh, wage earners, uh, doing a lot
[3924.88s] better than
[3926.599s] the investor class who have been jammed
[3930.0s] into these seven mag seven stocks that
[3932.0s] just got their asses handed to them. Um,
[3935.68s] uh, and have no international exposure
[3938.079s] to offset that.
[3940.44s] um they&#39;re going to be the ones that are
[3942.64s] going to do less well and the ones that
[3944.64s] are going to do really well are going to
[3946.88s] be the ones that uh are diversified exus
[3950.359s] international and you know small cap
[3952.799s] value all the themes we&#39;ve covered as
[3955.28s] well as uh regular Americans and that&#39;s
[3958.799s] when the country hums is when everyone
[3960.64s] participates not just a few at the top
[3963.2s] uh charts of the month FMS investor
[3966.0s] sentiment sinks to five fifth lowest
[3968.559s] level on record. We covered that in our
[3970.96s] article. We&#39;ll do that in
[3973.079s] detail. MAG 7 valuations are at their
[3975.68s] lowest level since January 2023 pending
[3977.92s] new earnings guidance. I think the
[3980.559s] guidance might come down a little bit
[3981.839s] more. So, this might not be an accurate
[3983.359s] number
[3985.48s] yet, but I&#39;m not going to lie. You know,
[3987.839s] I keep looking at Amazon and even
[3990.559s] Invidia when it got under
[3992.76s] 100.
[3996.2s] Um, time will tell. not doing anything
[3999.119s] there yet because there&#39;s so many better
[4000.88s] opportunities. It&#39;s like all those you
[4003.039s] can buy and if we&#39;re right and we trade
[4005.599s] back to the top of the range maybe you
[4007.2s] make you know 30 40 50%. But I&#39;m not
[4010.72s] really willing to commit any type of
[4012.559s] capital uh ever unless it&#39;s at least a
[4015.68s] double if not a triple plus um even if I
[4018.64s] have to play the time arbitrage game and
[4020.24s] it plays it takes a few years I just
[4022.4s] don&#39;t take risk for 30 to 50%. It&#39;s just
[4024.64s] not not what I do. uh valuations of all
[4027.599s] major indices are now below their
[4029.44s] 10-year
[4032.039s] averages. Uh that&#39;s fascinating with
[4035.44s] small cap having the largest
[4039.16s] divergence of 24% below its uh discount
[4044.64s] below its 10-year average on the forward
[4047.119s] price to earnings ratio. April 9th was a
[4050.319s] record for an advancing declining
[4052.24s] volume. That was that day when Trump
[4054.799s] said now&#39;s a good time to buy stocks.
[4058.599s] Um, and I think that tweet is going to
[4062.079s] go down in history because
[4064.92s] uh, you know, it did coincide with the
[4068.76s] low. Okay. Then you got a bounce and
[4071.119s] you&#39;re kind of consolidating and I think
[4073.839s] uh, we&#39;re going to resolve higher either
[4076.4s] immediately or over time. That&#39;s the
[4079.28s] history of Trump. volatility followed by
[4081.839s] upside resolution. Uh one month later
[4084.64s] you&#39;re up on average 5.2%, 10 month 3
[4087.68s] months later 11.9% 6 months later
[4091.16s] 18.2% and 12 months later on average up
[4095.0s] 29.2. So
[4097.96s] uh hang on. You know we&#39;re on the Disney
[4100.96s] ride and uh and we&#39;re getting to the
[4102.96s] exciting parts here. Scott
[4105.799s] Brown. Last week, S&amp;P opened lower by
[4108.799s] 2%, closed up more than 5%. May 1970 was
[4111.759s] the only other time we&#39;ve seen that. It
[4113.04s] marked a multi-year low, and stocks
[4114.4s] gained an additional
[4117.56s] 56%. That&#39;s a very small sample, Scott,
[4120.159s] but uh thank you for your service. All
[4122.799s] right. Big gains tend to lead to much
[4124.96s] higher
[4126.759s] prices. Uh here was what happened after
[4129.839s] 5% gain.
[4132.4s] uh very similar type of chart. So you
[4134.319s] were down a little bit 5 days out, but a
[4136.0s] month later you&#39;re up. Three months
[4137.279s] later, six months later, you&#39;re up
[4138.96s] almost 11%. 12 months later, up 27. So
[4141.52s] the the history supports good things
[4143.359s] happening. Uh car dealership, securing a
[4146.48s] loan hasn&#39;t been this easy. That&#39;s
[4148.88s] surprising. Car dealership guy, April
[4151.199s] 14th. Securing a car loan hasn&#39;t been
[4153.52s] this easy since December 2022. Access to
[4156.88s] auto loans pre-tariffs improved 3.1%
[4159.199s] year-over-year in March thanks to
[4160.799s] increases in approval rates, subprime
[4162.88s] loan share, and down payment
[4164.159s] percentages. But the number of borrowers
[4165.679s] who owe more on their loans than their
[4167.199s] cars are worth also continues to rise.
[4169.92s] And with the tariff uncertainty in the
[4171.52s] mix, only time will tell how this
[4173.6s] loosening will last. By the way, that&#39;s
[4176.56s] really good news for us because if
[4178.48s] people are upside down on their cars,
[4180.48s] they can&#39;t unload them in the used car
[4183.12s] market u because they got to they got to
[4186.159s] pay they got to pay off the loan which
[4188.159s] means the supply of used cars in theory
[4191.839s] should go down and the supply of new
[4194.56s] cars with better terms and incentives um
[4198.239s] is going up. So you might find a
[4200.88s] scenario where the people with used cars
[4203.76s] have to hold on to them, which is what
[4205.28s] helps Advanced Auto Parts, and the
[4207.44s] people looking to buy cars, you used or
[4209.84s] new, wind up getting better deals buying
[4211.92s] new cars versus used cars. Uh, and that
[4214.88s] helps Cooper Standard volumes. So I like
[4217.36s] that percentage of overbought and
[4219.04s] oversold stocks in the S&amp;P 500. Uh,
[4223.32s] again, you can get the sense there.
[4225.679s] Volatility index closed above 50.
[4236.48s] the returns just get
[4242.12s] huge.
[4244.04s] One, two, three, four, five years out.
[4247.12s] When you buy stocks after the VIX closed
[4249.679s] above 50, it&#39;s day and night. I mean,
[4252.88s] you&#39;re talking a 55%
[4256.36s] spread if you did
[4260.04s] it five years out, buying stocks when
[4263.44s] the VIX is below 50 versus buying stocks
[4265.36s] when the VIX is above 50 like last week.
[4268.0s] Uh, pretty awesome. I&#39;m super excited
[4270.48s] for uh everyone that&#39;s with me and I&#39;m
[4274.4s] super excited for the ones that topped
[4276.88s] up a bit and uh came in fresh as well.
[4280.0s] Uh, but everyone&#39;s really going to do
[4281.36s] well based on where we are. Uh, most
[4283.04s] strategists see S&amp;P rebounding by year
[4285.64s] end. Uh, widest gap in
[4288.679s] sellside S&amp;P 500 targets this century.
[4292.4s] The last time you had this big a gap was
[4295.32s] 2009, 2002, and 20, I&#39;m sorry,
[4300.6s] 2009, 2022, and 2002. All times were
[4305.12s] times to
[4306.12s] buy. This is This is kind of funny.
[4308.96s] Democrats one-year inflation
[4310.4s] expectations are 8%. Republicans
[4312.56s] one-year inflation expectations are
[4315.88s] 1%. I mean, it&#39;s it&#39;s unreal. I I mean,
[4319.84s] people making investment decisions on
[4322.159s] the basis of their political outlook
[4326.239s] um is super dangerous. And and I look, I
[4328.96s] had to tell people during the Biden
[4330.32s] administration, oh, he&#39;s going to
[4331.44s] destroy the country. I&#39;m like, yeah, but
[4333.28s] stocks are going to go up, so have a
[4335.92s] nice day, you know, go take a chill
[4337.44s] pill. And same thing here. Trump&#39;s going
[4339.84s] to destroy the world. Yeah, but stocks
[4341.92s] are going to go up. So, go take a chill
[4343.52s] pill. Um, it&#39;ll get resolved. Retail
[4346.32s] flows as a percent of aggregate market
[4349.4s] cap. All right. Companies issuing EPS
[4352.719s] guidance. Earning
[4356.36s] season. Okay. So, they&#39;re still doing
[4358.56s] some level of
[4359.88s] guidance here. This shows you
[4363.4s] drawdowns. Pretty normal in the scheme
[4366.64s] of things.
[4367.84s] ratio of insider buyers versus insider
[4371.0s] sellers. Insider buying is picking up
[4374.0s] pretty
[4375.08s] materially. China retail sales and
[4377.36s] exports grew faster in March in the face
[4379.199s] of Trump&#39;s
[4380.92s] tariffs. Retail sales were the highest
[4383.84s] in over a
[4386.36s] year. Industrial production was the
[4388.64s] highest in
[4390.6s] more multiple years. Policy uncertainty
[4393.76s] index versus the S&amp;P 500. So when policy
[4396.96s] uncertainty
[4398.76s] peaks tend to be near
[4401.08s] bottoms. China first quarter GDP tops
[4404.159s] estimates at 5.4% as growth momentum
[4406.56s] continues amid tariff worries. 63% of
[4409.679s] FMS fund manager survey. Investors
[4412.08s] expect China stimulus to boost growth in
[4414.48s] the second half of 2025. We agree. China
[4417.28s] retail sales value turning right back
[4419.76s] up. That helps Alibaba. uh S&amp;P 600
[4422.8s] quarterly EPS
[4425.56s] growth bottomup consensus. So Q1 they&#39;ve
[4429.199s] taken down and they think it&#39;s going to
[4430.719s] come back half back end loaded. We
[4433.159s] agree. Uh S&amp;P EPS impact depending on
[4438.52s] the increase in tariff
[4446.12s] rate. Okay. So you&#39;re looking
[4454.199s] lowend 7% to 30 30 $7 to
[4458.76s] $35. All right. United States, they&#39;ve
[4462.719s] already taken it down seven. United
[4464.64s] States retail sales year were solid.
[4467.52s] They say that they&#39;re not confident, but
[4469.12s] they keep spending. So that&#39;s the
[4470.719s] difference between the hard data and
[4472.0s] soft data that we&#39;ve talked about. CEO
[4474.08s] confidence has fallen to its weakest
[4475.6s] since the great financial crisis. You
[4477.36s] know, this guy&#39;s always bearish.
[4479.56s] Um, and by the way, the last time it got
[4482.48s] this low
[4483.48s] was 2022, fall 2022. Many of these folks
[4488.64s] were super bearish in the hole in 2022.
[4491.92s] And that was the time to buy, not to
[4493.36s] sell. Manufacturing, someone&#39;s American
[4495.719s] dream. Uh, America would be better off
[4498.48s] if more Americans worked in
[4499.92s] manufacturing.
[4502.88s] That&#39;s funny. All Americans and
[4506.0s] Republican leaning Americans all say 80%
[4509.52s] say America would be better off if more
[4511.6s] Americans worked in manufacturing. And
[4513.76s] then um the percentage so that&#39;s 80% of
[4517.92s] people and then 20% say I would be
[4521.36s] better off if I worked in a factory. So
[4524.56s] it&#39;s like you know someone else should
[4526.8s] go work at the sweat shop, not me. But
[4529.84s] um so you kind of got to put this in
[4531.6s] perspective. I I kind of joke with my
[4533.12s] friends. I said, &quot;Look, we want people
[4534.719s] to install the robots, program the
[4537.28s] robots, monitor the robots, but not
[4539.679s] become the robots.&quot; Uh so we got to be
[4541.76s] careful on the type of policy that we
[4543.36s] wish for. Total foreign pol holdings of
[4546.0s] US equities, treasuries, and US
[4549.0s] credit. Foreigners
[4551.4s] own 18 point
[4553.96s] uh 18.5
[4557.12s] uh 20% of the total equity market, 30%
[4559.6s] of treasuries, 30% of corporate
[4562.679s] credit, dollar
[4564.76s] index and US 10-year yields. Dollar
[4567.84s] index has been rolling over materially.
[4570.08s] This 10-year yield bump was kind of
[4574.6s] um a malfunctioning of the Treasury
[4577.84s] market which got resolved so far but has
[4580.8s] the administration on notice to get it
[4582.56s] get a deal done. All right. Median S&amp;P
[4586.32s] stock bid assass spread highest since
[4589.36s] 2020 lows uh 2020 COVID lows. That&#39;s
[4592.719s] that was a buying time. Russell 3000
[4595.84s] liquidity lowest since COVID. So, these
[4598.64s] are things
[4599.64s] that you&#39;re going to
[4601.8s] see if we don&#39;t get a deal soon, you&#39;re
[4604.32s] going to see liquidity facilities
[4605.84s] announced that are going to basically be
[4608.08s] QE under a different
[4612.12s] name. But, you can&#39;t quue QE your way
[4616.04s] to consumer confidence and earnings
[4619.76s] power. So, that will be a temporary
[4621.36s] solution if they don&#39;t get their act
[4622.56s] together and and take yes for an answer.
[4625.52s] uh unbalanced world share of global
[4627.92s] consumption manufacturing by regions.
[4630.4s] You can see that this is the balance
[4632.8s] that Trump wants to work out. We&#39;re
[4634.719s] going to talk about that in the article.
[4636.48s] Dollar change 2025 worst start to a year
[4639.28s] since 1995 for the US dollar. That was
[4642.239s] part of one of our key themes coming
[4643.84s] into the year. Inter US dollar weaker.
[4647.04s] Treasuries get bid. Okay, that started
[4649.679s] to happen except for this malfunctioning
[4652.32s] in the last week.
[4654.92s] um value outperforms growth,
[4657.36s] international outperforms US, small
[4659.679s] outperforms large. So, uh the latter
[4662.239s] hasn&#39;t worked. Many of the former have.
[4664.4s] I think the latter comes to play once a
[4666.0s] deal&#39;s inked. Uh stocks are not vote
[4669.12s] winners for
[4671.4s] Trump. Middle income households only
[4674.08s] have 10% of their assets. The other
[4675.679s] thing that they have to keep in mind,
[4677.44s] one that we&#39;ve said, if they push this
[4679.6s] too far, we will have a recession and uh
[4683.04s] it will be a absolute slaughterfest in
[4685.52s] the midterm election. So companies will
[4687.92s] then be able to uh they won&#39;t have to
[4690.48s] wait three and a half years to uh wait
[4694.0s] out Trump for making their investment
[4697.28s] decisions. They they&#39;ll have to wait one
[4699.12s] and a half years because he will have
[4700.56s] absolutely zero power after the midterms
[4703.04s] if they don&#39;t do a deal. If they do do a
[4705.239s] deal and they do this grand package, uh
[4709.199s] it could be another sweep, uh which
[4711.04s] means they&#39;ll be able to get everything
[4712.159s] done, including taxes, including
[4713.84s] everything else. So, all these things
[4715.679s] are in flux, but um point to, you know,
[4719.44s] it&#39;s kind of you can have the good
[4721.44s] outcome either the hard way or the easy
[4723.12s] way, your choice. And um Xi always chose
[4727.12s] the hard way. We&#39;re going to see if
[4728.719s] Trump follows the same pattern, but
[4731.199s] eventually she got his ass handed to him
[4733.92s] and had to flip the switch uh and shift
[4737.199s] his policy last year and we saw equities
[4739.52s] follow and do the right thing after he
[4741.28s] had exhausted all other possibilities.
[4743.44s] Uh and we&#39;re going to find out Trump
[4745.52s] Trump seems to be more proactive. if he
[4747.12s] likes to get the wins without the pain
[4749.36s] uh or at least as much of the pain and
[4751.84s] um you know volatility followed by
[4753.76s] upside resolution valuation discounts of
[4755.92s] small caps relative to midcap I mean the
[4759.0s] these you haven&#39;t had this opportunity
[4761.28s] since 2020 2001 which we keep going back
[4764.96s] to and uh that was a record you know the
[4768.239s] next five six years record out
[4769.84s] performance for small cap so ignore at
[4772.4s] your own underperformance peril S&amp;P
[4775.04s] stock uh performance in
[4778.12s] 2025. So obviously defensive have have
[4780.88s] done well. If you back this up a month,
[4782.88s] this would look entirely different. Cuts
[4784.88s] like a knife. Net revision momentum for
[4787.28s] stocks. 12 month forward earnings per
[4789.12s] share. Obviously, everyone&#39;s downgrading
[4791.84s] uh estimates in the hole. Just like you
[4793.76s] saw Goldman Sachs on Monday, they put
[4795.76s] out a recession call uh at 100 p.m. And
[4799.04s] then at uh 1:30, Trump tweeted, &quot;We&#39;re
[4802.159s] going to do an exemption for the
[4804.96s] electronics.&quot; And then 2:00 they said,
[4806.719s] &quot;Did we say recession? We were, you
[4808.8s] know, if you can&#39;t take a joke.&quot; And
[4810.56s] then two days later they said, &quot;Well,
[4812.8s] yeah, I know. We took back our recession
[4814.4s] call. Now we&#39;re going to have a
[4815.36s] recession.&quot; I mean, these guys are
[4816.56s] clowns. Clowns without a circus. And
[4819.159s] uh it I I sympathize with them because
[4823.199s] it&#39;s it&#39;s not easy to make decisions
[4825.199s] when the earth keeps shifting underneath
[4827.04s] you and the rules of the game are
[4828.4s] unknown. So, uh, I
[4831.239s] definitely empathize with them, but you
[4834.96s] got to be less reactive and you got to
[4838.08s] look at, you know, Charlie Mer, big fan
[4841.6s] of and student of Charlie Mer is if you
[4845.52s] understand incentives, you can get a
[4847.679s] good sense of outcome. And you know, if
[4850.719s] you look at what are Trump&#39;s incentives,
[4852.4s] what are G&#39;s incentives, what is the
[4854.159s] world&#39;s incentives, eventually you know
[4856.4s] where this is going. The question is, do
[4858.88s] you know what you own so you can hold on
[4860.8s] long enough to get the benefits of where
[4862.88s] any rational thinker would know this is
[4864.56s] headed? And if you get there, then you
[4868.32s] use these opportunities uh to be better
[4871.36s] positioned than everyone else when it
[4872.8s] finally occurs, which is what we&#39;ve
[4874.56s] done. If you don&#39;t know what you own and
[4877.12s] you just trade on price and momentum and
[4878.8s] what the crowd does and you&#39;re a sheep,
[4880.56s] sheep get slaughtered and uh that&#39;s what
[4882.719s] happens. you sell in the hole thinking
[4884.96s] you&#39;re going to be cute and buy lower
[4886.64s] and you think you&#39;re going to be able to
[4887.84s] time everything and those people just
[4889.92s] get destroyed. They get carried out on
[4892.08s] stretchers and then the thing is back at
[4893.92s] new highs and they&#39;re not benefiting and
[4896.0s] they&#39;re permanently impaired forever. Um
[4898.88s] so that&#39;s what we try to help you
[4901.96s] avoid each week with hedge fund tips
[4904.8s] with Tom Hayes. uh and
[4907.96s] um okay so a lot of people are feeling
[4910.32s] pain both the 6040 portfolio hasn&#39;t
[4912.56s] worked uh because of that malfunctioning
[4915.28s] it will work over time you&#39;ve always had
[4917.44s] periods like this where that happens
[4919.52s] eventually it re recovers uh bare market
[4922.8s] lows and forward return so you can see
[4925.36s] here average 12-month out 45.8 8 off the
[4930.36s] low. Top 10 airport signs of weakness in
[4935.159s] arrivals. This is uh people coming into
[4938.239s] the US. So, we&#39;re kind of hurting oursel
[4939.84s] that way. China&#39;s GDP growth beats
[4942.239s] expectations for the first quarter of
[4944.52s] 2025. Like to hear that as an owner of
[4947.04s] Baba. Retail sales boosted by government
[4949.199s] subsidies in China. The game is on,
[4950.96s] ladies and gentlemen. Money goes where
[4952.88s] it&#39;s treated best. And the West is in
[4955.679s] austerity. West meaning the US right now
[4957.84s] is in austerity. The east is in stimulus
[4960.96s] and uh and that&#39;s where equities are
[4962.719s] going to do the best. Foreigners own 33%
[4964.88s] of the US Treasury market. So good luck
[4967.44s] on uh overplaying your hand in
[4969.76s] negotiations with that. Market
[4971.76s] expectations for Fed funds rate keep
[4974.32s] coming down. Retail sales change. What
[4976.32s] was the biggest one? Uh this was in
[4978.639s] March, ladies and gentlemen. Motor motor
[4980.56s] vehicles and parts. Cooper Standard
[4983.12s] Advanced Auto Parts number one over
[4986.36s] five% retail sales
[4989.8s] growth. US retail sales diffusion index
[4993.12s] positioning across sector groups. Uh
[4996.0s] healthc care
[4997.48s] positioning. This is going to be a buy.
[4999.6s] By the way, uh soft data diverging from
[5003.52s] hard data. This is what I said. The
[5005.04s] difference between people what they say
[5006.8s] they&#39;re doing and what they&#39;re actually
[5007.84s] doing. What they&#39;re say doing is the
[5009.76s] world is coming to the end. what they&#39;re
[5011.199s] actually doing is buying stuff.
[5013.96s] Uh, oh, it&#39;s going to be a great
[5015.92s] depression. I got to go get a car before
[5017.52s] tariffs come in. Uh, you can&#39;t still
[5019.679s] can&#39;t get a restaurant at a a
[5021.28s] reservation without a week notice in
[5023.679s] Orange County. I mean, it&#39;s it&#39;s
[5025.04s] mindboggling. Atlanta Fed GDP now
[5028.48s] estimate
[5030.679s] um, negative. Okay, so that&#39; be one
[5033.36s] quarter up to Trump if it&#39;s going to be
[5034.88s] two quarters and get an actual
[5036.239s] recession. I doubt it.
[5039.199s] Uh, Prime Book, consumer staples
[5042.0s] interest over time. This is interesting.
[5043.76s] Taow. Look at this. Google search has
[5047.52s] gone from flatline to off the charts in
[5051.52s] the past month. There is on Tik Tok
[5056.639s] um all the China manufacturers are
[5059.199s] rebelling against the Trump tariffs and
[5062.4s] they&#39;re basically screwing all the Nikes
[5065.199s] of the world and saying, &quot;Hey, uh, come
[5067.36s] into my factory. We get like $10 for
[5069.92s] every um shoe that Nike buys from us and
[5074.239s] they sell it for $140. So, uh if you&#39;re
[5077.12s] worried about 100% tariffs, here here&#39;s
[5079.52s] our link. Just buy directly from us.
[5082.08s] Even with the 100% tariffs, you&#39;ll pay
[5083.92s] $20 versus $120. I mean, if Trump plays
[5087.199s] his hand too long, this could lead to a
[5089.76s] lot of branded companies going out of
[5092.159s] business. I mean, LDMH, they had fake
[5094.4s] purses, 30 $40,000 purses for $2,000. I
[5097.84s] was watching these. Mattie Mills told me
[5099.44s] about it. I&#39;m like, &quot;No, I I you know,
[5102.08s] Stephen posts on Tik Tok for me. We have
[5104.08s] a huge channel. I never really go on
[5106.08s] TikTok.&quot; Um, but um, there you go. All
[5110.32s] right, on to the next. Warren Buffett,
[5112.96s] someone&#39;s sitting in the shade today
[5114.159s] because someone planted a tree a long
[5115.6s] time ago. And those of you who planted
[5117.28s] your trees in 2022 and 2023 and and
[5120.88s] today uh when we look a year, two years,
[5123.92s] three years out, you&#39;re going to be
[5125.12s] sitting in this in the shade smiling so
[5127.6s] wide you could eat a watermelon
[5128.88s] sideways. Uh and you&#39;ll look back and
[5131.04s] say, &quot;Yeah, I had some white knuckles.
[5132.8s] Boy, that was an uncertain time.&quot; But I
[5135.679s] knew the businesses we own, they&#39;d come
[5138.08s] out stronger. Even in the worst case
[5139.76s] scenario, you know, we&#39;re not buying a
[5142.4s] bodega on the corner that if Trump
[5144.56s] throws us into a recession is going to
[5146.48s] shutter and be taken over by a new
[5148.56s] owner. We are buying the biggest public
[5150.719s] companies that have brand ownership in
[5153.92s] their spaces. So, if it got bad, all
[5157.36s] their competition, their smaller
[5158.88s] competition that are non-public, etc.,
[5161.6s] uh, are going to go out of business and
[5162.88s] they&#39;re just going to pick up share. So,
[5164.96s] either way, they win. If we don&#39;t go
[5166.719s] into a recession, they&#39;re already the
[5168.4s] best, so they&#39;re going to rebound the
[5169.679s] fastest. If we do go into a recession,
[5171.76s] they&#39;re going to win over a longer term
[5173.6s] because they&#39;re going to buy up all the
[5174.88s] people that went out of business, uh, or
[5176.96s] gain share, one or the other. Okay, so
[5178.88s] here&#39;s Sloomer. Thanks to my friend who
[5180.32s] sent this over. Uh, you know, looks like
[5182.56s] we&#39;re at support here on the S&amp;P. Uh,
[5185.679s] here&#39;s our, uh, year one of the election
[5188.199s] cycle. Tends to be terrible into the
[5191.52s] 13th week. That&#39;s why we&#39;re talking to
[5193.52s] you in early February. Buckle up,
[5195.84s] buttercup. So, we got this for sure,
[5198.56s] little bounce, and then we got down
[5200.48s] further. So, here we are. It&#39;s make or
[5202.639s] break time. Does this hold up and and
[5205.04s] shock everyone and follow its normal
[5207.6s] seasonal pattern? Uh, we&#39;re going to
[5209.52s] find out, you know, uh what is it? Liber
[5212.719s] Well, maybe maybe we crashed off of
[5216.96s] Liberation Day and we&#39;ll rally off
[5219.92s] resurrection day. I mean, who who knows?
[5222.6s] Um, but I&#39;m sure that will be stolen.
[5225.12s] That quote will be stolen. Uh, if it if
[5227.84s] it holds to be
[5229.159s] true. All right. Uh, we got that
[5231.92s] sell-offs. You can see here percentage
[5233.84s] of stocks above their 200 day moving
[5235.52s] average. Deeply oversold. These are
[5237.92s] bounce modes. Bounce modes. Bounce
[5239.76s] modes. Bounce modes. So, you look at
[5241.199s] these probability weight. Sometimes it
[5243.04s] takes a little longer. Here&#39;s another
[5244.32s] thing. Bullet VIX index again got up to
[5247.12s] 60 and change. If you&#39;re not a buyer
[5248.719s] when the VIX is 60, I don&#39;t know what to
[5251.12s] tell you. like find another hobby and
[5252.96s] hire someone who can do it for you. Uh
[5255.36s] who number one was never handed a FOMO
[5257.679s] gene and number two has ice in their
[5259.8s] veins. For better or for worse, that&#39;s
[5262.08s] my genetic composition.
[5264.44s] Um equal weight uh Russell 2000
[5269.32s] again MCI Europe bouncing. So this all
[5272.56s] looks okay. DAX, I wouldn&#39;t be a buyer
[5275.76s] of the DAX. Uh Tokyo, they&#39;ve got a huge
[5278.4s] trade surplus. We&#39;re going to take some
[5280.0s] of that from them. Uh, and so is the
[5281.92s] rest of the world. Tokyo Stock Exchange
[5283.36s] bounced off the lows. Hang Sang, same
[5285.96s] thing. Uh, 10-year yield bounced up to
[5289.44s] 450. Probably that&#39;s it. When this gets
[5292.56s] resolved, probably falls back down. Um,
[5296.4s] I mean, this is this was just a
[5297.92s] malfunctioning week and I think it&#39;s
[5299.76s] going to back off pretty quick. Dollar
[5301.6s] index getting close to the bottom of the
[5303.679s] range. Will it break through? If they
[5305.52s] deval, I mean, it could go down to 88,
[5307.92s] which would be pretty awesome for
[5309.36s] emerging markets in China. Uh, DXY, it&#39;s
[5312.639s] right here at support. Let&#39;s see what
[5315.08s] happens. Canadian dollar, all the looney
[5317.679s] skeptics, look what&#39;s happening, late.
[5319.36s] You know, we got to overcome this
[5320.639s] resistance. I think you&#39;re going to be
[5322.32s] very, very happy over the long term.
[5324.239s] Euro, and you&#39;ll be sending Trump a
[5325.84s] Christmas card. How&#39;s that? Um, I know
[5328.96s] you don&#39;t see that right now, but USD,
[5331.28s] Chinese,
[5332.199s] yuan. Okay, so they weakened. Look, they
[5335.04s] just said, &quot;Oh, okay. You want to tariff
[5337.199s] blah blah blah. We we&#39;ll be weak ahead
[5339.199s] of it. Uh, tariff away and then they&#39;ll
[5342.32s] strengthen the yuan back to where it was
[5344.0s] before and Trump will declare victory.&quot;
[5347.239s] Um, oil looks like it&#39;s bottoming out
[5349.679s] here. Gold looks like it might be
[5351.12s] peaking
[5352.199s] here. Uh, that&#39;s what gives me a little
[5355.6s] more confidence that there might be
[5357.12s] substance to these rumors, but we&#39;ll
[5359.96s] see.
[5362.679s] Copper. Copper is uh has a PhD in
[5365.44s] economics. It&#39;s bouncing off the lows
[5367.04s] here, probably off of China GDP
[5373.4s] numbers. Apple bounced and rolled
[5377.32s] over. A lot of these are bouncing. I
[5380.48s] think they trade up to the top of the
[5381.76s] range. I don&#39;t I I don&#39;t know much more
[5383.52s] than that. And uh like I said, not
[5386.56s] really interested in 30 to 50% moves.
[5388.96s] I&#39;m interested in 100 200 300% moves. Uh
[5392.719s] but you know they look interesting
[5394.56s] that&#39;s for
[5400.36s] sure.
[5402.12s] Baba bounce to support now rising. It
[5405.28s] takes out 120. We&#39;re going straight back
[5408.52s] up 10 cent.
[5413.92s] Blackstone and a lot of these great
[5415.76s] companies just got pounded and that&#39;s
[5418.48s] opportunity for those of
[5420.28s] you who were paying
[5424.92s] attention. All right, thanks for that. I
[5427.52s] think we got an update from
[5436.199s] today. What is
[5438.28s] this? Gold to copper
[5441.4s] ratio. Yeah. All right. uh chance of
[5444.0s] rate cut down to 72% after Powell&#39;s
[5448.4s] beautiful speech
[5450.679s] yesterday.
[5453.56s] Uh happen to agree with Trump. He&#39;s he&#39;s
[5456.239s] far too rest he he&#39;s far too
[5457.92s] restrictive. I mean
[5460.76s] you&#39;re by the way the last time headline
[5463.52s] inflation was this low 2.4% they
[5467.159s] started cutting with 50 basis points of
[5470.08s] cuts.
[5473.239s] So when I talk about, you know,
[5476.639s] quantitative tightening is effectively
[5478.48s] over with only $5 billion a month of
[5481.76s] tightening relative to whatever they
[5483.92s] were doing, 35 billion.
[5489.88s] Um whether they start easing or not will
[5493.04s] depend on the deal announcements across
[5495.44s] the tape.
[5498.0s] Buffett most people get interested in
[5499.76s] stocks when everyone else is. The time
[5501.199s] to get interested is when no one else
[5503.04s] is. You can&#39;t buy what is popular and do
[5505.28s] well. We continue to emphasize markets
[5508.239s] gripped by pessimism as bearish
[5509.92s] sentiments breaks 35-year record.
[5512.159s] Remains above 50% for eight straight
[5514.92s] weeks. Uh you know, last time it did
[5519.04s] that was the early 90s. That was a buy.
[5521.52s] Anything close was 2009 generational
[5524.88s] buy.
[5527.48s] 2022 huge
[5532.6s] buy favorite chart of the month. He&#39;s
[5535.28s] talking about VIX volatility plus AI
[5540.44s] bears record fear and then he just shows
[5543.44s] what happens in the next 52 weeks.
[5545.96s] 20% 19% 59% up 36% up 11% up 21% up 21%
[5552.719s] up 30% up 24% up 21% up 33% up you know
[5556.8s] when you back up and you burn yourself
[5558.239s] with the facts just like the hat says uh
[5561.92s] good things happen okay here&#39;s from JP
[5564.0s] Morgan thanks to John uh China
[5567.04s] e-commerce March 25 online sales
[5569.52s] accelerated growth concludes solid first
[5571.84s] quarter
[5573.8s] 2025 China&#39;s Online retail sales in Q1
[5576.88s] increased
[5579.48s] 7.9% year onyear on a monthly basis.
[5583.36s] Online retail sales in March grew
[5586.199s] 8.9%. Okay, who&#39;s the toll taker? 40
[5589.12s] cents of every dollar goes to Alibaba in
[5591.679s] online sales. Online physical goods, uh,
[5594.719s] gross merchandise value increased 5.7%.
[5598.08s] Online physical goods 6.9%. Overall
[5600.639s] retail sales 4.6%. So look, um, and then
[5605.36s] they go on to
[5610.679s] upgrade Alibaba. Uh, is this the same
[5613.44s] report where they upgrade Alibaba? I
[5615.84s] don&#39;t know. One of them upgraded Alibaba
[5617.44s] this week. I thought that showed a
[5618.48s] little sign of courage, which was nice
[5619.76s] to see from the sell side. Alibaba&#39;s
[5621.76s] Taow surges in popularity as in US as
[5624.96s] Trump tariffs boost Chinese shopping
[5627.239s] apps. All the unintended consequences.
[5629.76s] These politicians are it&#39;s it&#39;s
[5631.719s] mindboggling. We now made them
[5633.679s] effectively independent in chip
[5635.28s] production because of the the uh
[5639.639s] um the the restrictions. So now they can
[5642.88s] go hog wild on AI and they&#39;ve beaten us
[5645.12s] in AI between AI between uh Deepseek and
[5649.04s] Alibaba&#39;s models and BU and Tencent.
[5653.199s] um that wouldn&#39;t have happened
[5655.96s] if reactionary US policy didn&#39;t force
[5660.0s] them to beat us in those areas. It&#39;s
[5662.48s] like we&#39;re forcing them. We&#39;re trying to
[5664.56s] stop them and we&#39;re forcing them to beat
[5666.56s] us. It&#39;s just so silly.
[5671.0s] Um we&#39;d be better. Well, I&#39;ll leave it
[5674.32s] at
[5675.0s] that. Some things better on said. So, uh
[5678.56s] boost
[5679.48s] consumption. All right. China open to oh
[5683.12s] yeah so Chinese boosting consumption
[5685.12s] we&#39;ve talked about they want to get
[5686.84s] from they want to get up to 70% domestic
[5690.0s] consumption in the next 10 years China
[5691.679s] open talks if US shows respect names
[5694.08s] point person could you imagine it&#39;s like
[5696.48s] a clown show you
[5698.44s] got trying to cut a deal and you have
[5701.04s] seven people talking uh on behalf of the
[5704.159s] president and only one guy with
[5705.52s] decision-making power if you&#39;re trying
[5706.96s] to sell your business and they send in
[5708.8s] some junior VP who&#39;s 27 7 years old with
[5711.28s] his clipboard to do deal due diligence.
[5713.28s] You&#39;re like, &quot;Are you signing the
[5715.28s] check?&quot; No. Get the hell out. Get your
[5717.92s] CEO who&#39;s actually going to do the deal
[5719.76s] or not do the deal. If you want to do
[5721.36s] due diligence, I need to talk to him. I
[5723.199s] don&#39;t want to talk to the 26-year-old.
[5725.04s] And basically, Trump&#39;s got a lot of
[5726.56s] quote unquote 26 year olds running
[5728.08s] around with clipboards that have
[5729.36s] absolutely zero authority just wasting
[5731.36s] time.
[5732.6s] Fundamentally, Xi and Trump need to get
[5734.96s] to the table. Trump and the prime
[5737.28s] minister of Japan need to get to the
[5738.96s] table on the phone and the 27 year olds
[5741.84s] can work out the details uh but not
[5744.239s] really have any say or power because
[5745.92s] it&#39;s just a complete waste of time. It
[5747.6s] just leads to retrading and deals
[5749.679s] falling apart. Complete waste of time.
[5752.239s] Decision makers only, please. Trump
[5754.159s] spares smartphones, computers, and other
[5756.0s] electronics from China tariffs. So, it
[5757.76s] showed some flexibility earlier in the
[5759.199s] week. That&#39;s what we covered on BBC.
[5761.199s] China&#39;s stock rescue in full swing as
[5763.28s] ETF inflows hit record. China&#39;s strong
[5766.159s] GDP growth fails to call fails to stem
[5769.84s] calls for urgent stimulus which they are
[5772.6s] doing. Alibaba backed AI startup Zippu
[5776.8s] targets IPO as soon as 2025. Like I
[5779.52s] said, Alibaba is the greatest way to
[5781.52s] play AI startups because they&#39;ve got
[5783.04s] equity in all of them in exchange for
[5784.96s] compute power that they gave to them.
[5791.92s] China&#39;s March lending jumped on
[5794.0s] government stimulus
[5797.0s] push. Alibaba Quark surpasses Bite Dance
[5800.32s] Dubau, Deep Seek and Deepseek as China&#39;s
[5802.96s] top AI app. That&#39;s Alibaba&#39;s Quark is
[5805.76s] China&#39;s top AI app. US Nvidia H20
[5810.159s] restrictions could be a shot in the arm
[5812.32s] for Chinese AI chips. Okay. and uh
[5816.8s] unintended consequence of
[5820.159s] illplanned policy. Investors haven&#39;t
[5822.4s] been this bearish in 30 years. BFA poll
[5824.88s] shows that&#39;s from HartNet. That&#39;s the
[5827.44s] bearish level. And
[5829.639s] that&#39;s if you&#39;re not buying during those
[5832.08s] times, hire someone who knows how to buy
[5834.719s] during those times. That&#39;s the smartest
[5836.56s] thing you can do.
[5840.36s] Um dollar bearishness reaches highest
[5842.8s] level since 2006. just the beginning.
[5845.84s] Ford and GM stocks pop after Trump says
[5848.08s] he&#39;s looking at an auto tariff pause.
[5850.96s] Global electric vehicle sales jump 29%
[5853.6s] in
[5854.76s] March. US retail sales jump by most. By
[5858.08s] the way, that helps not only uh Cooper
[5860.32s] Standard with their China exposure and
[5862.4s] and European exposure. It helps
[5864.92s] Albamaro. US retail sales jump by the
[5867.28s] most in two years on car buying
[5869.56s] rush. Car buying rush. Did you think you
[5872.8s] would see that headline? It&#39;s like all
[5874.56s] of these bad policy decisions are going
[5876.239s] to be net benefits to
[5878.84s] us. Intel to sell majority stake in
[5881.76s] Alterara for 4.46 billion in fund
[5884.56s] revival effort. Lip Boo Tan is taking
[5888.719s] massive action quickly. It&#39;s going to
[5890.48s] work out very nicely with him. Why we
[5892.88s] think the market&#39;s outlook for housing
[5894.32s] stocks is overly bearish. This is from
[5896.239s] Morning Star. We agree, but we would not
[5898.8s] play the waring factions homebuilders.
[5902.239s] We would pay play the arms dealers like
[5905.52s] QXO, Generrack, Stanley Black &amp; Decker.
[5908.239s] We have a lot of exposure to this uh uh
[5910.96s] directly indirectly. US power use to
[5913.44s] reach record highs in 2025 2026. Comto
[5916.96s] stock baby. Comm stock. Uh Trump pushes
[5919.76s] trade partners to buy more US energy as
[5921.679s] a way to avoid higher tariffs. Duh.
[5924.4s] Okay. Comto stock, baby. All right.
[5926.639s] Don&#39;t fight the data. Stock market and
[5928.32s] sentiment results. uh covered all the
[5931.04s] media stuff. Uh Bank of America fund
[5933.96s] survey. Top five things, top five
[5936.96s] points. Number one, FMS investor
[5939.36s] sentiment is now at its fifth lowest
[5941.44s] level on record, only behind the 2009
[5944.159s] great financial crisis, 2018 trade war,
[5946.639s] Silicon Valley Bank lows in March of
[5948.88s] 2023. All of which were significant
[5951.04s] buying opportunities. You can see all
[5953.199s] these low levels were huge buying
[5955.92s] opportunities. 2022, 2009, 2011, 2016.
[5961.44s] By the way, it&#39;s interesting. Remember I
[5963.679s] talked about as a possible analog 2011,
[5966.159s] if this was going to take 8 months to
[5968.08s] get back to new highs, it&#39;s barely a
[5970.56s] blip on the long-term chart. And if it&#39;s
[5973.88s] 2018, it&#39;s more like this, this kind of
[5976.8s] abrupt down and abrupt recovery. So, uh,
[5980.159s] you can see those cash levels back to
[5982.32s] 4.8%, 8% biggest two-month jump since
[5984.8s] April of
[5986.44s] 2020. Generational buy opportunity all
[5989.679s] coming off the 15-year low in February.
[5993.52s] FMS allocation lowest since July
[5998.04s] 2023. Opinion continues to follow trend
[6001.119s] with 73% of investors now believing the
[6003.36s] theme of US exceptionalism has peaked.
[6005.92s] US stock outperformance doesn&#39;t mean US
[6009.36s] US exceptionalism. I&#39;m not going to say
[6011.52s] never, but I&#39;m going to say never. Not
[6013.44s] in our lifetimes. Why? Because never in
[6016.56s] the history of humankind have you had
[6019.119s] this melting pot of the greatest ideas
[6021.92s] and the risktaking people from all
[6023.84s] around the world that wanted to come
[6025.199s] here for a better life. You can&#39;t
[6027.04s] replicate that. All the other countries
[6029.36s] are homogeneous for the most part and
[6032.56s] they&#39;re set in their ways and it&#39;s
[6034.159s] generational. and the ones I&#39;ve been
[6035.6s] there for
[6036.679s] generations. This is such a beautiful
[6040.08s] country and
[6041.8s] it&#39;s predicated on immigration. So, I
[6044.96s] hope we don&#39;t screw screw that up,
[6047.119s] okay? Because we need the best and the
[6049.679s] brightest who want to come here to be
[6051.36s] here to create their businesses, to
[6053.6s] create their jobs, to buy their
[6055.04s] laundromats, to do their dry cleaners,
[6057.6s] to do their tech startups. That is what
[6060.239s] makes America great. It&#39;s there&#39;s
[6061.84s] something in their DNA where they say,
[6064.0s] &quot;Yeah, I grew up in Mumbai for 18 years,
[6066.96s] but I&#39;m going to risk it. I&#39;m going to
[6068.159s] leave all my family and all my friends
[6069.76s] because I&#39;m so ambitious and I&#39;m going
[6071.6s] to go to the promised land in America
[6073.52s] and I&#39;m going to with a $100 in my
[6075.36s] pocket and I&#39;m going to gamble.&quot; Or I
[6077.119s] grew up in Shanghai or some rural town
[6081.119s] and I studied a lot of math and I&#39;m
[6083.04s] going to go to America and I&#39;m going to
[6085.04s] see if I can start something up and that
[6087.199s] could change the world. uh and um you
[6090.32s] know and if I fail I&#39;ll have you know
[6092.88s] $50 is zero and I&#39;ll go back. People
[6096.239s] with that type of DNA that were willing
[6098.239s] to leave everything behind to take a
[6100.32s] risk to bet on
[6102.04s] theirelves. You can&#39;t replicate that and
[6104.8s] we have natural resources and we have
[6106.48s] natural defense. So yeah, US stocks are
[6108.96s] going to underperform relative to
[6110.159s] international for a little while but US
[6111.92s] exceptionalism isn&#39;t going away anytime
[6114.08s] soon.
[6115.76s] 63% of FMS investors now expect China
[6118.239s] stimulus to boost growth in the second
[6119.6s] half. We agree and it could be even the
[6122.32s] first half despite this embargo for the
[6124.56s] last 5 days. Uh Bessant does a great job
[6127.84s] explaining what a deal could look like.
[6130.0s] Pay attention. We&#39;ll see if the deal and
[6131.84s] those are some of the components that I
[6133.119s] covered earlier in the show. The general
[6134.88s] idea behind a potential deal would
[6136.48s] involve China focusing more on domestic
[6138.32s] consumption and less on state subsidized
[6140.639s] manufacturing while the US cuts back a
[6142.32s] bit on consumption and builds up its
[6143.76s] manufacturing base. Looking at the chart
[6145.76s] below, it&#39;s pretty clear why this
[6147.52s] rebalancing makes sense for both sides.
[6149.92s] So you can see US consumption all the
[6152.48s] way out here, US manufacturing all the
[6155.119s] way down here, and China&#39;s just the
[6156.719s] inverse. Euro zone is actually pretty
[6159.28s] equal on consumption and manufacturing.
[6161.76s] And I think basically what you want to
[6163.36s] see is the world get closer to all being
[6165.679s] even like the Euro zone.
[6170.8s] If you&#39;ve been with us for a while, you
[6172.08s] know this shift in China towards a
[6173.44s] consumption-driven economy is something
[6174.88s] we&#39;ve been talking about along with the
[6176.159s] Chinese government for a long time. In
[6177.52s] fact, Chinese government has been made
[6179.119s] boosting made boosting domestic demand,
[6182.08s] particularly consumption. Alibaba being
[6184.239s] the toll taker, the top economic
[6186.239s] priority this year. That&#39;s why they took
[6187.679s] Jack Ma out of hiding and put him gave
[6189.44s] him a medal a few few months ago. Right
[6191.679s] now, consumption makes up about 55% of
[6194.159s] the overall GDP in China compared to 70
[6196.159s] to 80% in wealthier nations. China&#39;s
[6198.32s] aiming to hit 70% by 2035. I can&#39;t
[6200.56s] emphasize enough how massive this shift
[6202.0s] toward consumption really is. To put it
[6203.84s] in perspective, China&#39;s GDP in 2024 was
[6206.08s] 18.8 trillion with consumption making up
[6208.719s] about 55% or 10.34 trillion if they hit
[6211.28s] their target of 5% growth this year and
[6213.199s] then slow to 3% annually through 2035,
[6215.6s] reaching their 70% consumption goal
[6218.0s] would mean
[6219.4s] $18.57 trillion in consumption alone by
[6222.96s] 2035. Let that sink in. That&#39;s an 8.23
[6225.679s] 23 trillion jump in new annual
[6227.92s] consumption. Consider 40 40% goes
[6230.639s] through Baba. That&#39;s $3.5 trillion. Uh
[6234.08s] you do the math. That&#39;s another 300
[6236.48s] billion dollar of earnings. Put a 10
[6239.28s] times multiple on
[6240.679s] that plus their existing business plus
[6243.44s] their AI. You got a $4 trillion company.
[6245.6s] So while everyone&#39;s waiting for Nvidia
[6247.04s] to hit 4 trillion, you might be waiting
[6249.04s] a long time. It wouldn&#39;t be shocking on
[6252.639s] those numbers. We won&#39;t be around when
[6254.239s] it&#39;s at 4 trillion. probably and maybe
[6255.76s] we&#39;ll have a little trailer on it. But
[6258.199s] um so who&#39;s the best position to
[6260.4s] benefit? Alibaba, the totaker of the
[6261.84s] middle class, holding 40% of the
[6263.04s] e-commerce market still growing. It&#39;s
[6264.88s] hard to imagine they don&#39;t capture a
[6266.08s] massive slice of the pie. So clearly
[6267.84s] this shift is coming is something that
[6269.36s] they&#39;ve already been working on with or
[6270.8s] without a deal. The article below
[6272.48s] explains it in detail. You can read the
[6274.0s] Bloomberg
[6276.199s] article. So here&#39;s how we see it. If a
[6278.56s] deal&#39;s reached between US and China,
[6279.92s] we&#39;ll probably see an even bigger push
[6281.04s] towards domestic consumption in China.
[6282.48s] And if tariffs stick around, China will
[6284.56s] have no choice but to shift towards
[6286.239s] consumption to make up for the hit
[6287.44s] export-driven GDP growth. Either way,
[6289.44s] Alibaba will be laughing all the way to
[6290.96s] the bank. It&#39;s also worth pointing out
[6292.639s] that China has a pretty powerful toolkit
[6294.639s] to speed up this shift towards domestic
[6296.159s] consumption, namely the long-awaited and
[6297.52s] much rumored bazooka style stimulus.
[6299.52s] Unlike its Western counterparts, China
[6301.119s] didn&#39;t pump out stimulus during the p
[6302.56s] pandemic. So, they have plenty of room
[6303.84s] to use both monetary and fiscal tools.
[6305.76s] That&#39;s a luxury US and Europe just don&#39;t
[6307.6s] have, and the market seems to have
[6308.88s] recognized and begun to price this in.
[6310.8s] So you can see here government debt to
[6312.719s] GDP. In fact, maybe this is why the
[6314.639s] Chinese government held back on pulling
[6316.0s] the trigger. Perhaps they saw a
[6317.119s] potential Trump 2.0 term and a trade war
[6319.52s] on the horizon. So they decided to hedge
[6321.119s] their bets and keep some of the ammo in
[6322.48s] reserve. Either way, they have the tools
[6324.719s] and more now more than ever. Good reason
[6326.719s] to use them. It&#39;s over $20 trillion
[6329.04s] sitting in household deposits waiting to
[6330.56s] be spent. It&#39;s time to be unleashed the
[6332.4s] bazooka. Shifting from domestic
[6333.84s] consumption and stimulus to a less
[6335.76s] exciting topic. We figured out it would
[6337.28s] be a good time to address the elephant
[6338.639s] in the room. something we thought was in
[6340.48s] the rearview mirror, which is delisting.
[6343.04s] Rumors began circulating this past week
[6344.719s] after Fox Business senior correspondent
[6346.639s] Charles Gasparina published a tweet
[6348.08s] below. Charles is a fantastic
[6350.0s] journalist, really good guy. I&#39;ve had
[6351.84s] dinner with him before. I know him. Um,
[6354.48s] and he&#39;s just reporting the information
[6356.56s] that he gets. Um, and then Brendan Ahern
[6359.84s] put out an article the next day breaking
[6361.52s] down. Look, there is a desire. It&#39;s
[6365.52s] certainly a negotiating chip. I don&#39;t
[6367.44s] see a deal where China and the US cut a
[6371.76s] deal and
[6373.48s] China&#39;s access to US capital markets is
[6376.4s] removed. I like that is the nuclear
[6378.4s] option. If if Trump um cuts off their
[6382.08s] access to US capital markets, I think
[6385.119s] the trade war turns into a hot war. I&#39;ll
[6387.36s] just put it that way. Um, but the joke
[6389.92s] will be on the US because the only
[6392.159s] people that get hurt if they delist the
[6394.08s] US ADRs is US investors and pensions.
[6396.96s] Um, not the Chinese who own it in Hong
[6399.36s] Kong. So, uh, that would kind of be like
[6402.32s] if if if you&#39;re China and you&#39;re
[6405.84s] competing with the US, the best thing
[6408.719s] that could ever happen to you is they
[6410.32s] delist your stocks because number one,
[6412.159s] you just take your business to London
[6414.08s] and Hong Kong and international money
[6416.48s] will find you. it goes where it&#39;s
[6417.6s] treated best. Number two,
[6421.04s] $800 billion of investor capital of your
[6425.119s] opponent has been evaporated. And um so,
[6429.52s] you know, could there be people that
[6431.6s] stupid in the administration that would
[6433.44s] move forward with this? Of course. Um
[6436.639s] so, we&#39;re going to talk about how you
[6437.92s] hedge against that. Is the likelihood
[6440.639s] there that there will be no adult in the
[6443.6s] room to explain to them in English, like
[6445.679s] to a three-year-old what happens if you
[6448.239s] actually do this to yourself and you
[6449.6s] point the gun not at your opponent. It
[6451.76s] actually has a reverse uh huzzle that
[6454.4s] points right back at you. Uh we think
[6457.36s] so. And we know that the the right
[6460.0s] people are going to go down to
[6461.04s] Washington and explain this to them
[6462.88s] because it&#39;s understandable. You would
[6464.8s] think this is a way to hurt your enemy,
[6466.32s] but you know, they tried it with
[6468.56s] semiconductors and it was the worst
[6469.92s] thing they ever
[6472.04s] did. Hopefully, they learned from their
[6474.08s] mistakes. So, Brendan Ahern, good buddy
[6476.159s] of mine, he runs the KWEB ETF, number
[6478.96s] one ETF for China internet, uh, put out
[6481.84s] a great article the next day breaking
[6483.28s] down the rumors and laying out the
[6484.56s] facts. He also hosted a tariff briefing
[6486.4s] webinar that covered, among other
[6487.76s] things, delisting fears. I highly
[6490.08s] recommend you listen below. uh talks
[6492.639s] about we&#39;ve been to this movie before in
[6494.32s] the last few years. They went through
[6495.44s] the PCAOB
[6497.199s] uh etc. Part of it has to do with
[6500.88s] um Atkins, the new SEC chair, getting
[6503.639s] votes. You know, he won by 52 votes, so
[6506.56s] it was a tight vote and some of the
[6508.08s] people that put him over the top would
[6510.0s] like to see him explore this issue
[6511.76s] further. So, he&#39;s going to do that for
[6514.159s] sure. whether whether what he finds
[6516.88s] after exploring you know many months
[6518.96s] later uh is another discussion. The
[6522.8s] other risk you have is an executive
[6524.239s] order.
[6526.52s] Um so that&#39;s that. We&#39;re going to tell
[6529.36s] you what we&#39;re doing around that in a
[6530.96s] second. Fears around delisting are
[6532.639s] nothing new. We went through the same
[6533.679s] back cycle back in 202122 end up with
[6536.32s] the Chinese government stepping in
[6538.08s] changing its laws to allow the PCAOB
[6540.159s] full access to inspect the US listed
[6541.92s] Chinese companies. Alibaba along with
[6544.239s] nearly 300 other ADRs passed those
[6546.719s] audits with flying colors. Now that the
[6549.159s] PCAOB has had access to over two years,
[6551.84s] it&#39;s tough to see logical case for
[6553.56s] dellisting. The other funny thing is the
[6556.159s] the administration has this fantasy in
[6558.0s] their mind about golden shares that the
[6560.639s] P, you know, PRC owns big slugs of these
[6564.96s] companies and and the fact of the matter
[6566.56s] is all you have to do is look at the cap
[6568.719s] table. Okay, they certainly influence. I
[6570.96s] understand that. That&#39;s just like Trump
[6572.8s] is influencing Apple and Nvidia and uh
[6576.8s] shaking them down to invest in the US.
[6578.8s] That&#39;s a, you know, that&#39;s kind of a
[6580.159s] good thing, but they don&#39;t really have a
[6581.36s] choice in the matter. It&#39;s like do what
[6583.119s] I say or you&#39;re dead. Uh offer they
[6585.679s] can&#39;t refuse. So, I don&#39;t see how that&#39;s
[6587.36s] a whole lot different. But the fact of
[6588.8s] the matter is there are
[6592.28s] a clear number of shares outstanding.
[6595.28s] there is a clear net income and the net
[6597.92s] income is divided by those shares
[6599.44s] outstanding which are disclosed in the
[6602.48s] uh in the in the public filings and the
[6605.119s] public holdings of who owns the company.
[6606.639s] So uh where this fantasy phantom owner
[6610.0s] is uh it doesn&#39;t make sense because when
[6612.48s] I divide share count by earnings power I
[6615.52s] get the exact number that they publish
[6617.04s] on the website along with every other uh
[6619.36s] company. So do they influence? Yes. Do
[6621.84s] they maybe have uh seats on different
[6625.119s] boards? Yes. Does the US influence our
[6627.52s] major comp companies now? Yes. Less so a
[6630.56s] few months ago. Now it&#39;s a major factor.
[6633.76s] Uh a little bit autocratic if if we&#39;re
[6637.04s] being objective about it. Uh but as far
[6640.48s] as them owning
[6641.8s] shares, it just doesn&#39;t foot. I mean,
[6644.32s] you could have a fantasy in your mind
[6645.6s] that that&#39;s the case, but if EPS matches
[6650.36s] S, it is what it is. Okay. So, uh, okay.
[6655.6s] So, now that PCAOB has had access to
[6657.76s] their data for two years, it&#39;s tough to
[6659.199s] see a logic a logical case for D-listing
[6661.28s] and betting on delisting or calling
[6663.119s] China uninvestable has been your belief
[6664.639s] the last couple years. It hasn&#39;t been a
[6666.0s] profitable one. But just as we discussed
[6667.679s] in last week&#39;s article, we need to
[6668.96s] burden ourselves with the facts, not the
[6670.48s] rumors, not the noise. What are the
[6672.08s] actual facts? And here they are. US ADRs
[6674.239s] are held by US investors, not the
[6676.48s] Chinese government or Chinese investors.
[6678.8s] Over $800 billion of US investor capital
[6682.48s] sits in 286 China ADRs. Dellisting China
[6685.92s] ADRs would do nothing but vaporize
[6688.639s] nearly a trillion dollars of US and cap
[6690.88s] US investor capital, including pension
[6693.679s] funds for teachers, firemen, police
[6697.04s] officers, uh etc. um union workers,
[6701.44s] okay, uh manufacturing people on the
[6704.88s] assembly line, uh all while the Chinese
[6707.52s] government laughs all the way to the
[6708.719s] bank. You basically just took the gun
[6711.119s] out and shot yourself and took a
[6712.8s] trillion dollars out of your firepower.
[6714.96s] Uh two, on the flip side, China old
[6717.44s] holds $1.3 trillion worth of US
[6720.48s] treasuries and about $370 billion worth
[6722.8s] of US equities. They could easily
[6724.639s] liquidate these in re retaliation. If
[6726.719s] lowering the 10-year yield is this
[6728.239s] administration&#39;s top
[6729.8s] priority. It&#39;s hard to believe they
[6732.239s] would cross the line, this line, and
[6734.32s] open the door for such retaliation. It&#39;s
[6736.159s] natural to make threats when you, you
[6737.76s] know, when you&#39;re negotiating to get
[6739.199s] what you want, but doing so would be the
[6741.119s] equivalent of shooting yourself in the
[6742.48s] foot on the world stage. And three, the
[6744.8s] US has the number one capital markets in
[6746.96s] the world because rumors like this don&#39;t
[6749.199s] happen. foreign companies, whether from
[6751.199s] China or elsewhere, pay enormous fees to
[6753.28s] list in the United States and go through
[6754.88s] all the regulatory hurdles in vetting.
[6757.52s] Weaponizing delisting for political
[6759.36s] purposes wouldn&#39;t exactly encourage
[6761.36s] foreign companies to IPO or list here in
[6763.76s] the future, and it would undermine the
[6765.52s] strength of American capital markets.
[6767.28s] Basically, you just push tens of
[6769.36s] billions of dollars of business to
[6771.199s] London and to Hong Kong. So, uh maybe
[6773.92s] that&#39;s another reason to be ex US
[6776.239s] equities uh and looking at opportunities
[6778.4s] in UK and Hong Kong. Now, if fears over
[6780.8s] D-listing are keeping you up at night,
[6782.239s] Baba shareholders can easily convert
[6784.0s] their US ADS&#39;s to Hong Kong listed
[6786.4s] shares. There is no real downside to
[6788.56s] doing so. A step-by-step guide directly
[6790.56s] from Alibaba is listed below. Again, we
[6793.119s] see this as an unlikely scenario and a
[6795.119s] hard line is in the sand. What really
[6797.44s] matters is that you focus on what you
[6799.04s] can control. And when you buy high
[6801.04s] quality businesses, when they&#39;re marked
[6802.48s] down, good good things tend to follow.
[6804.32s] Alibaba is no different. So what we are
[6807.88s] doing, it it it&#39;s it&#39;s really funny.
[6811.599s] Literally a month ago, I was going
[6816.04s] to call our custodian and have all of
[6820.4s] our Hong Kong
[6822.36s] shares convert that we converted during
[6825.199s] this first fear converted back to Baba
[6828.84s] ADS&#39;s. And I was like, let&#39;s just hold
[6831.84s] off. So now I&#39;m going to make the call.
[6836.0s] Uh I have made the call. I&#39; I put it in
[6838.159s] two days ago. uh we&#39;re going to convert
[6840.56s] all of our USADS shares to Hong Kong.
[6845.44s] Not because we think anything&#39;s really
[6847.52s] going to happen, but we want to hedge
[6849.119s] against it. Um but we are keeping 100%
[6853.52s] of our US ADS derivatives because we
[6857.199s] really can&#39;t replicate the upside in
[6860.32s] those in any other instrument and we
[6862.4s] can&#39;t replicate them in Hong Kong.
[6866.199s] So where we come out is as a fiduciary
[6869.52s] we want to hedge our downside. If a
[6872.239s] nuclear option happens and it was some
[6874.08s] executive order
[6875.4s] delisting
[6877.0s] our options are probably wiped but
[6880.719s] because we own the shares in Hong Kong
[6884.32s] over time the equities on that theme
[6887.76s] China XUS will dramatically more than
[6890.88s] make up for getting wiped on the
[6892.639s] derivatives. Uh, so we have to hedge it
[6896.239s] so we can keep the
[6897.96s] derivatives. If I if I had to assign a
[6901.599s] probability of a of a highly stupid
[6904.239s] decision, I&#39;d put it at like 7 to
[6907.48s] 12%. But
[6909.639s] by
[6911.719s] straddling, you know, where most of our
[6914.159s] money is in the equities and putting
[6916.08s] that all in Hong Kong. So if we lose on
[6919.04s] the options, the stock over the next two
[6921.76s] years is going to make multiple times of
[6924.159s] that back and multiple times on the
[6927.04s] invested overall invested capital of
[6929.52s] both the derivatives and the stock. So
[6932.159s] that theme and position in the
[6934.599s] portfolio will do net exceptional even
[6938.0s] if the worst case scenario occurs.
[6941.08s] Um, and then if the best case scenario
[6944.0s] occurs, which is they just leave it
[6945.599s] alone and let markets do what markets
[6947.28s] do, uh, we&#39;ll we&#39;ll be at no
[6949.599s] disadvantage by owning the stocks in
[6951.679s] Hong Kong and we&#39;ll get the additional
[6954.0s] kicker benefit from all of our options
[6957.119s] uh, and derivatives based in the US. So,
[6959.76s] we&#39;ll get, you know, five bites at the
[6962.4s] Apple versus two bytes at the Apple. And
[6964.56s] that&#39;s the best way I could think of it
[6965.76s] because there&#39;s no other way to express
[6968.8s] the expected value on that little pocket
[6971.44s] of derivatives than the way we have it
[6973.119s] set up. And we want to ride that and we
[6975.119s] think that um the odds are in our favor,
[6979.199s] but we&#39;re hedging it out in if they&#39;re
[6981.119s] not and the nuclear option comes, we are
[6983.92s] prepared for it. we have the stock to to
[6986.32s] ride uh prospectively in Hong Kong and
[6990.639s] uh and it will more than make up for the
[6992.56s] the the loss in uh the USDS uh issue
[6997.92s] which again we assign a very low
[6999.52s] probability. So if I&#39;ve got a 10%
[7001.04s] probability I&#39;m not going to give up a 5
[7003.44s] to 7 5 to 7x expected value over the
[7006.88s] next 12 to 24 months. I&#39;m just not going
[7008.48s] to do it. Especially when the percentage
[7010.0s] of the overall assets is small but the
[7012.0s] upside is so big. And that&#39;s how we&#39;re
[7014.239s] just managing it as
[7015.8s] fiduciaries in that pocket of our
[7018.08s] portfolio that&#39;s dedicated to China to
[7020.719s] just hedge against any very small
[7023.84s] outside risk but not nothing risk and
[7028.48s] that&#39;s all we can do. So the earth
[7031.52s] shifts underneath us every single day.
[7034.0s] Uh it doesn&#39;t change the underlying
[7035.76s] business. the underlying business is
[7036.96s] only going to get better regardless of
[7038.239s] the outcome. But how do we ensure that
[7042.32s] we&#39;re in a position to guarantee take
[7044.32s] advantage of it and more likely than not
[7047.44s] take advantage of it in every single way
[7050.4s] possible under the sun and that&#39;s really
[7052.159s] what we want to do and that&#39;s what we
[7053.36s] are going to do. So that&#39;s how we&#39;re
[7054.88s] dealing with it. You do what you do. I
[7056.8s] mean, I rode
[7058.36s] out PCAOB with a ton of US ads and uh
[7064.0s] and really didn&#39;t blink because I knew
[7065.599s] if if there was a legal respect and
[7068.719s] framework that ultimately it wouldn&#39;t be
[7070.96s] delisted and that&#39;s exactly what
[7073.36s] happened. uh I have
[7076.28s] to be open to the dimminimous
[7079.199s] possibility that a legal framework is
[7081.199s] not respected and that&#39;s why we&#39;ve taken
[7083.679s] action and made the request two days ago
[7086.8s] uh and uh should be executed uh shortly.
[7089.76s] So,
[7091.96s] um, and my guess is at these levels, I
[7096.08s] mean, we we bought plenty of BABA last
[7098.88s] week, by the way. That&#39;ll become 9988,
[7103.04s] uh, probably tonight or tomorrow, and we
[7106.32s] look forward to buying more. So, nothing
[7108.32s] in our thesis has changed. Where we hold
[7111.119s] the bulk of our money that&#39;s committed
[7112.719s] to the idea, i.e. in the stock, uh, is
[7115.76s] going to change just just as a hedge. Uh
[7119.36s] and because the odds are 90% in our
[7122.719s] favor that the nuclear option will not
[7125.599s] be triggered, uh we do nothing with this
[7128.56s] small piece of our overall assets that
[7131.04s] has a monstrous upside expected value
[7134.239s] of, you know, 5x plus uh and we&#39;re going
[7136.719s] to just ride ride or die on that small
[7138.719s] piece. And that&#39;s what we always do in
[7140.0s] the derivative bucket anyway. So uh
[7142.719s] super excited about that. Fear and greed
[7144.719s] down here. Buyer not seller. National
[7146.96s] Association of Active Investment
[7148.48s] Managers turning up. So that&#39;s good from
[7150.32s] very low levels. ADR dlisting risk back
[7153.119s] in focus. This is from Goldman Sachs. I
[7155.04s] think John sent
[7156.52s] this. Um I think they go through all the
[7161.28s] history basically assigning a low
[7165.56s] probability. Uh here are some of the
[7168.239s] things that would happen. Following
[7170.639s] summarizes a simplified procedure for
[7173.199s] dellisting from an investor&#39;s
[7174.56s] perspective based on historical
[7175.92s] precedence. Investors sell before the
[7178.239s] last day of the ADR trading after 10
[7180.32s] days of the filing of form 25 with the
[7182.239s] SEC. Investors will be able to freely
[7184.32s] trade and sell the soontobe delisted
[7186.32s] stock on US exchanges at prevailing
[7188.08s] market price before the securities last
[7190.08s] trading day in the US. B. Investors
[7192.4s] could continue to trade the shares on
[7193.92s] the OTC market subject to their mandate
[7196.4s] and investment scope. For instance, Luck
[7198.719s] and Coffee,
[7200.199s] LKNCY, was delisted from the NASDAQ on
[7202.88s] June 29, 2020, but its shares are still
[7205.84s] trading on the over-the-counter market.
[7210.199s] Um, so that is
[7213.56s] um I think BABA has an over-the-counter
[7216.88s] uh version also called BABAF
[7221.36s] uh which trades in line with the
[7222.88s] underlying ADS and with the Hong Kong
[7225.04s] share prices anyway. And
[7228.119s] any difference will be arbed out. So you
[7231.119s] don&#39;t really have to worry about where
[7233.119s] it&#39;s traded and getting a huge discount
[7234.96s] because if there&#39;s a huge discount,
[7236.239s] someone will arb that out over time. Uh
[7238.56s] C, investors can trade on other
[7240.4s] exchanges as the stock is listed on a
[7242.08s] major other exchange and can return
[7243.599s] their ADS and um withdraw the equivalent
[7247.28s] deposited security i.e. Hong Kong shares
[7251.639s] uh based on previous cases even after
[7254.719s] the effective D-listing date. So you
[7257.199s] don&#39;t have to do this now at all. Uh and
[7260.56s] D investors p receive the net proceeds
[7263.28s] upon the termination of the ADR program.
[7265.199s] Investors take no action uh before and 6
[7269.599s] months after. Oh, listen to this. If
[7271.76s] investors take no action before and 6
[7274.0s] months after the D-listing date, the
[7276.599s] depository will commence the sale of
[7279.199s] ordinary shares represented by
[7280.8s] unreturned ADRs at prevailing market
[7282.96s] price if listed elsewhere. So you&#39;ll
[7285.04s] basically get the Hong Kong price in
[7287.04s] cash and pay the net cash proceeds after
[7290.32s] applicable fees and expenses to the ADR
[7292.159s] shareholders. So basically, if you do
[7294.8s] nothing and it stops trading, what this
[7296.8s] is saying from go Gold Goldman Sachs is
[7300.08s] it&#39;ll just send you your money at the
[7301.52s] Hong Kong price. Um, but we don&#39;t want
[7304.96s] cash, we want appreciation. Uh, and this
[7307.679s] is just getting started. So, you know,
[7310.159s] reading this, my inclination is to again
[7312.96s] do nothing, but uh, as a fiduciary, my
[7315.84s] inclination is to hedge that risk. So,
[7318.96s] uh, in my, you know, so that&#39;s that
[7322.0s] energy
[7323.239s] earnings, you know, look, I have a
[7325.76s] monstrous amount of personal exposure
[7327.36s] and a monstrous amount of derivative
[7328.88s] exposure. I&#39;m doing nothing with my
[7330.159s] derivatives. Completely comfortable with
[7331.599s] that. With the stock, we do all the the
[7335.119s] same across the board. So, um, so that&#39;s
[7337.679s] how we play out. I think net effect is
[7340.159s] it&#39;s going to be a net positive.
[7342.92s] Um, and then in three and a half years I
[7345.36s] can convert back to
[7346.92s] ads&#39;s. Can&#39;t make this stuff up. All
[7349.119s] right. Energy
[7358.52s] top. Okay. So, uh, energy earnings down
[7363.4s] 3.9%. Everyone&#39;s taking down their
[7365.28s] estimates. Defense earnings top 30 ways
[7367.52s] down 1.9% next year down 6. Uh those
[7371.52s] will go back up if we get the
[7374.36s] resolution.
[7375.51s] [Music]
[7377.08s] Uh economic data we covered. Estimates
[7379.92s] have gone from 275 down to uh
[7385.159s] 268. So estimates continue to come down
[7388.8s] and now we&#39;re going to do the ask me
[7391.679s] anything questions. Uh so for those of
[7394.56s] you who don&#39;t like the ask me anything,
[7396.96s] we&#39;ve got a lot of them. It&#39;s going to
[7398.159s] take a long time, but you you a lot of
[7399.599s] you get huge value. Stick with us. If
[7401.92s] you don&#39;t, we&#39;ll see you next week. Same
[7404.96s] time, different place, live from uh
[7408.92s] Hawaii, and we&#39;ll see you then for
[7411.199s] everyone else. Here we
[7413.159s] go. All
[7415.0s] right. Uh that is
[7417.88s] uh spam. Okay. Next,
[7425.32s] Ivan. Oh man, I get so
[7429.88s] many. All right, JT investor asks,
[7433.679s] &quot;Thanks for posting the information on
[7436.52s] ADRs. Could you please clarify if
[7438.56s] investing in KWEB fully avoids the risk
[7440.4s] of
[7443.239s] Dellisting?&quot; Uh,
[7445.4s] do Brendon has fully converted his
[7447.679s] portfolio. Uh, thank you and have a
[7449.679s] happy Easter with you and your family.
[7450.96s] Happy Easter to you, too.
[7453.239s] Um, I spoke to Brendan this week. Uh, I
[7456.88s] would say,
[7458.96s] uh, in his Forbes article, he said that
[7461.76s] I
[7462.679s] think 16% of his portfolio was US
[7467.719s] ads that uh, didn&#39;t
[7470.76s] have a version in Hong Kong that he
[7473.36s] could quickly convert to. So, those
[7475.44s] would probably just be cashed out and he
[7477.76s] would reinvest those in Hong Kong
[7479.28s] shares. So, I think uh it&#39;s perfectly
[7481.92s] fine to be in Kb as far as I understand.
[7485.199s] Uh so, I wouldn&#39;t worry about that and I
[7486.719s] would go ahead and go to Headphone Tips,
[7488.719s] go to the article. I listed his podcast.
[7490.4s] I&#39;m sure he explains all that, but uh
[7492.32s] no, I don&#39;t think I&#39;d have any problem
[7493.92s] investing in K web at all.
[7497.48s] Um so, there&#39;s that. And he&#39;s a good
[7500.32s] manager and
[7502.44s] uh leave it
[7504.36s] there. Okay. So, we got
[7507.0s] Cole&#39;s
[7511.96s] picture. Uh, can you look at lineage?
[7514.96s] This is from Gasper Mohoric Cold Storage
[7517.96s] [Music]
[7519.8s] Company.
[7528.44s] Lineage. Okay.
[7537.28s] Okay.
[7543.96s] Lineage L I N
[7553.88s] E. Yeah, I don&#39;t do companies that
[7556.56s] haven&#39;t been public for many years to be
[7558.719s] honest with you. So,
[7565.48s] uh, I have to see how they operate
[7568.08s] through multiple cycles because I it&#39;s
[7570.08s] it&#39;s very
[7574.119s] hard. Let&#39;s see what the balance sheet
[7576.32s] looks
[7579.159s] like. 170 of
[7585.159s] cash, six billion of debt. So that&#39;s not
[7589.76s] a good
[7598.36s] ratio to have 100 million in cash and
[7601.599s] six billion in
[7603.719s] debt in this environment or any
[7606.239s] environment. So for me, I mean, they&#39;re
[7609.36s] generating a lot of cash.
[7618.32s] I think you&#39;ve really got to do a lot of
[7620.079s] work on this to get comfortable with it
[7621.599s] and uh it&#39;s not going to happen on this
[7623.679s] call. So for for me I would it would
[7625.36s] just be an easy quick pass. I&#39;m like I
[7627.84s] don&#39;t need that to make something like
[7629.28s] that work. Ralph
[7633.639s] Reynolds you think Cooper Sander will be
[7635.84s] able to make up domestic market
[7638.04s] reductions through growth in China
[7639.88s] partners? Seems like BYD is a customer
[7643.36s] CEO reference plants within China. Uh
[7646.239s] partially I don&#39;t think you&#39;re going to
[7647.52s] see the again going back to this call
[7650.48s] row. Um I don&#39;t think it&#39;s going to be I
[7653.28s] think it&#39;s going to be better than
[7654.079s] expected. I think Q1 was amazing and I
[7656.239s] think that uh making up for the
[7658.4s] inventories once they come up with a
[7660.0s] deal here is going to be monstrous. Ken
[7663.4s] W hurts in light of Aman thoughts on
[7667.719s] Starbucks.
[7669.239s] Uh, let&#39;s
[7672.04s] see. Hurts. I really have no interest
[7674.32s] in. Um, I hope it works for Bill and um
[7679.04s] and it probably will. He&#39;s buying it
[7680.56s] with enough margin of safety, but um
[7684.48s] it&#39;s not a business I want to own long
[7686.28s] term. Um Starbucks SBUX is obviously
[7691.119s] down on the China. They might have to
[7692.719s] sell the Chinese b business. There&#39;s not
[7694.88s] enough margin of safety for me here. So,
[7696.96s] yeah, it&#39;s a good business and
[7698.239s] everything else. And I wouldn&#39;t bet
[7699.84s] against the Chipotle guy. He&#39;s going to
[7701.52s] figure it out. But, you know, talk to me
[7703.599s] if it gets down. Well, it&#39;s at 80. I was
[7706.159s] going to say talk to me if it gets below
[7707.599s] 100. It&#39;s at 80. All right. Uh, let&#39;s
[7717.32s] see.
[7719.88s] Yeah, I think for the long term, you&#39;re
[7722.56s] okay betting on this guy and this
[7724.4s] business.
[7727.119s] Uh, but I think you also might have an
[7729.92s] opportunity to get it a little
[7736.44s] cheaper. There&#39;s a lot of competition.
[7738.56s] Dutch Bros, everything else. I I would
[7741.88s] just I mean to say I&#39;d buy it at 70 or
[7745.36s] 75 and I wouldn&#39;t buy it at 8085 is
[7748.48s] pretty silly if it&#39;s a longterm thing,
[7750.159s] but that&#39;s kind of where I come out. Um,
[7753.84s] all right.
[7757.8s] Next, Matt Mitchell
[7761.0s] LVMH. I got to say, uh, yeah, I do want
[7765.28s] to buy these, but after seeing
[7768.44s] those China manufacturing videos on Tik
[7776.28s] Tok, gives me a little
[7779.0s] pause because kind of the the gig is up.
[7782.079s] I I I would I would wait on this. I I I
[7785.599s] understand like backward looking it&#39;s a
[7787.84s] complete no-brainer at these levels
[7789.76s] based on the fundamentals, but I would
[7792.32s] just probably step aside. Jason Moore,
[7795.199s] my son and I listen to your podcast each
[7797.119s] week. Thanks for all you do.
[7798.679s] AES, thank you for watching.
[7804.599s] AES, I mean, you got a utility. What&#39;s
[7808.32s] the dividend yield?
[7811.0s] Pretty sure that&#39;s a
[7823.96s] utility. 7% yield.
[7834.92s] Yeah, I guess you just got to look at
[7837.199s] their cap table, but I mean their
[7839.199s] capital
[7841.96s] structure for debt refinance, but I
[7844.56s] generally think you&#39;re okay with that 7%
[7848.44s] yield. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,
[7850.96s] whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,
[7852.44s] whoa. Let me rephrase that. What the
[7855.599s] hell is going on here? I I would just
[7857.679s] avoid this. This This is crazy for a
[7861.239s] utility. Where are these guys? is
[7863.96s] based in
[7867.32s] Virginia. All right. If you can get
[7871.28s] unshakable confidence that this negative
[7873.679s] free cash
[7875.0s] flow is over, maybe. But this is this is
[7879.679s] no bueno. So for I I would I wouldn&#39;t
[7882.8s] even waste time on it. Um there&#39;s not
[7885.36s] enough upside to take that kind of risk.
[7887.84s] If the if the upside, you know, if this
[7890.0s] thing could be a 10 bagger once they get
[7891.599s] it to cash flow positive or five bagger,
[7894.159s] yes. But like to make 50% and collect a
[7896.88s] 7% yield for possible existential risk,
[7900.079s] hell no. Chris Williamson, MU looks
[7903.599s] interesting here. Getting close to the
[7904.96s] bottom of the cycle. Okay, then buy it.
[7906.56s] I don&#39;t I don&#39;t know if that&#39;s a
[7907.76s] question or an or what, but
[7911.159s] um I&#39;m I&#39;m not a fan of MU. That&#39;s been
[7914.32s] a
[7920.56s] You might be right. I I just It&#39;s such a
[7923.92s] sick
[7925.0s] I I&#39;ll tell you what&#39;s what what&#39;s not
[7927.599s] going to happen is you&#39;re not going to
[7929.28s] get a triple or quadruple. And in Intel,
[7931.599s] if they do it half right, that&#39;s what&#39;s
[7933.44s] going to happen. So why would I screw
[7934.88s] around with this?
[7939.159s] Manique, is Charles Payne short or are
[7942.8s] you should have been in the NBA? How
[7944.639s] tall are you? Number one, Charles Payne
[7947.199s] is not short. Uh he&#39;s uh he&#39;s
[7950.44s] tall, tall, handsome guy. Uh two, I&#39;m
[7954.36s] 6&#39;5. And three, I think it&#39;s camera
[7956.639s] angle because like I said in his old
[7958.639s] studio, they did not look like there was
[7960.4s] that much stuff, but uh it is what it
[7962.56s] is. Brian Norman, what are your thoughts
[7964.4s] on Trump administration considering
[7965.92s] D-listing we just covered?
[7968.599s] Delete. Nicholas
[7970.84s] Wang with depressed car volumes now for
[7973.599s] 20. What are you talking about? What
[7974.96s] numbers are you looking at? We had
[7976.52s] record numbers in the month of March.
[7979.04s] So, burden yourself with the facts.
[7981.199s] Thank you for the question and thank you
[7982.639s] for tuning
[7987.88s] in. Must be in the blue line category
[7990.639s] where he thinks inflation is going to be
[7992.04s] 8%. Uh, Mr.
[7994.28s] Hayes. Okay. So, he&#39;s got a question on
[7997.04s] Matt Hollerin,
[7999.719s] longtime supporter, wants to do floor
[8002.4s] and decor, which we did on the podcast a
[8004.239s] few weeks ago, and I think we said fine.
[8006.32s] It&#39;s a home building
[8009.88s] play, home building recovery play, and
[8012.8s] yes, we do like it. Good
[8017.639s] work.
[8020.679s] Ah, let me just take a look here. I
[8024.0s] think you&#39;re a little early, buddy, but
[8026.719s] you&#39;re
[8028.36s] close. So, if you&#39;re thinking three
[8030.719s] years out, you could buy it here. If
[8032.32s] you&#39;re thinking longer, I just wait a
[8034.96s] little
[8038.76s] bit. What&#39;s the debt like? Yeah, they&#39;re
[8042.719s] fine
[8045.8s] there. So,
[8052.28s] so yeah, I think you&#39;re okay. I think
[8054.88s] you can probably get a little better
[8062.679s] price. I mean, if you get low 60s,
[8065.36s] you&#39;re probably I think you&#39;re okay
[8067.599s] here. Uh, good
[8070.44s] work.
[8071.59s] [Music]
[8076.679s] Uh next
[8084.44s] is from
[8090.199s] from thanks for your Carl Johnson. What
[8093.119s] would you say are the top three or four
[8094.159s] stocks in your portfolio biggest upside
[8095.679s] potential? I think you just equal weight
[8098.639s] 10 good ideas. Um, obviously we like
[8101.36s] Baba, obviously we like Cooper Standard,
[8104.0s] uh, but they&#39;re they&#39;re all this tariff
[8107.199s] thing created such amazing opportunities
[8110.48s] and my clients know which ones are our
[8113.199s] favorite based on the waiting in their
[8114.639s] portfolio and I&#39;ll leave that benefit to
[8116.4s] them. But for listening in, if you like
[8118.88s] some of the names, just equal weight
[8120.159s] them because you&#39;re never going to
[8120.96s] predict which ones go first. Some are
[8122.8s] going to double in less than a year and
[8124.639s] some are going to take three or four
[8126.079s] years. But if you&#39;ve got a basket of
[8128.239s] them, you&#39;re going to do
[8129.48s] great.
[8133.0s] Um, all right. Got that one.
[8154.04s] AJ
[8156.28s] Barley Cooper standard has a billion
[8158.32s] dollars in debt in three years. Market&#39;s
[8161.199s] currently pricing blah blah
[8168.84s] blah. Yeah. So, listen to the uh
[8172.56s] interview that I did with him. Welcome
[8174.239s] to the podcast. You&#39;re obviously new.
[8176.56s] Um, we did 38 minutes on we did a
[8179.76s] one-hour interview. Go to hedge fund
[8181.599s] tips at the YouTube channel. We
[8183.36s] discussed all of
[8185.079s] this. All right, next.
[8192.599s] Griffin Griffin Brown says, &quot;Typically
[8194.96s] listen podcast on our way to work.
[8196.8s] Recently started watching the podcast
[8198.08s] and it&#39;s much more beneficial.&quot; It&#39;s
[8200.679s] like three three times more valuable to
[8203.28s] be able to see it versus listen to it.
[8204.719s] But if all you can do is listen to it,
[8206.16s] I&#39;m glad to deliver that value as well.
[8208.639s] Uh do you typically use Koifin for your
[8210.479s] valuations and ratios or do you like to
[8212.639s] do them yourself using numbers from the
[8214.08s] 10K? Always go to source numbers if
[8216.16s] we&#39;re going to put um this is just for
[8218.399s] screening and a quick look to see if we
[8220.24s] should do real work, but no, everything
[8221.84s] comes from the public filings and we
[8223.599s] double and triple check everything.
[8227.559s] Um,
[8230.28s] GTN. That&#39;s from Keenan
[8236.04s] Martins.
[8239.88s] GTN. Great television. All right. I know
[8243.2s] the guy who runs this, he also has an
[8245.679s] insurance company I wanted
[8247.399s] to get involved in.
[8249.53s] [Music]
[8253.96s] Um, I understand what you&#39;re saying.
[8256.8s] You&#39;re generally right, but there are
[8258.479s] factors that you don&#39;t know that you
[8259.76s] don&#39;t know. So, uh, for me, it&#39;s a pass.
[8262.96s] Uh, Tom, you&#39;re the bacon
[8266.2s] bringinger. Okay, so this is about the
[8268.719s] CEO of Intel
[8272.519s] having Chinese investments through his
[8276.0s] fund coming under scrutiny. Look, the
[8278.08s] guy is Chinese. He was vetted by the
[8280.0s] board of directors. If he has to unwind
[8281.92s] some of his Chinese investments that his
[8283.84s] fund is in, he&#39;ll unwind some of his
[8285.92s] Chinese investments. He was on the
[8287.92s] board, he had the same investments. That
[8289.439s] that was just noise last week. Uh, and
[8292.399s] that&#39;s it. So, with that said, we&#39;ll see
[8294.639s] you next week. Same time, same place. In
[8296.639s] the meantime, make it a great one. Bye
[8298.639s] for
