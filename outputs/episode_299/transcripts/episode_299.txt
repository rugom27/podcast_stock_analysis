Welcome to Hedge Fund Tips with Tom Hayes. I&#39;m Tom Hayes and this is your 299th videocast podcast for the week ending July 9th, 2025. Hope everyone&#39;s having a great summer. Had a great Independence Day. Uh we&#39;ll get started with some social and family photos. Then we&#39;ll get right down to business. Uh my goal is this could be our first oneh hour podcast in a long time. Uh don&#39;t get used to it. Next week I&#39;m in New York doing TV. We&#39;re going to have a lot of content, but we got a lot of good AMAs this week, so it might wind up going over an hour. Famous last words. I got my hedge fund tips t-shirt on. You can get it on the website. But first, I want to thank Matio Tritnik from Slovenia, Montenegro, Croatia. He&#39;s got houses all over the place. Very successful businessman. But more important than that, he&#39;s got his BF Corp Timberland gear on. He went to visit the Timberland store in Irvine. While he was here, he&#39;s visiting with his beautiful family, doing Disney, doing San Diego, doing Orange County, doing Los Angeles, the whole entire coast of California. And where did we go for dinner? Uh, of course we went for steak at a restaurant on Pacific Coast Highway in Newport and had an incredible time talking business, markets, life uh, and uh, sharing his success stories and how how he uh, created multiple successful businesses. It was just an awesome time and uh, very grateful for that. So, thanks for that. Uh, then got to take uh, Annabelle and Caitlyn. Mimi was still in Croatia. amazing place. If you&#39;re ever in Newport, go to Ocean 48. Uh, blew my mind. And I&#39;ve been to a lot of good restaurants. Get the, uh, chicken fried lobster tail appetizer and the crab and all that stuff. There&#39;s some of my buddies uh, playing. There&#39;s Kenny owns half of Huntington Beach. Uh, my buddy Garrett, what a stick. Can fly pretty much any air vehicle, commercial pilot. And Ryan&#39;s got the best pizza places. He also has an AI company, but as a hobby, he&#39;s got the best pizza on the West Coast at RIIP uh in Huntington Beach, and we went there after I played. Uh this is the pizza. That&#39;s Caitlyn and Annabel. Uh thanks to my friend Daryl. Had us out to uh Newport Beach Country Club for a scholarship tournament. There&#39;s I call them Rick the Stick. Uh John and Jesse, we had an incredible time out there. And here are some pictures of Mimi in Croatia. Um uh and she just got back, by the way. That&#39;s why the podcast is a little late. I was so excited to see her. That&#39;s our uh Fourth of July. Uh was it was not as good of a weekend as it seemed. I got whammed with a ton of unexpected administration stuff I had to deal with. No bueno. But I did carve out time for the family to enjoy. That&#39;s Rick Caruso&#39;s yacht in the background, by the way. Those of you West Coasters, big real estate guy, REIT guy, and um at our friends at David&#39;s house. Uh had a wonderful time. That&#39;s Annabelle on the uh kayak. Uh more pictures from Croatia. That&#39;s the uh parade in town was pretty incredible with my friend Tony and Caitlyn obviously right there, my beautiful wife as you know. And then they had these muscle cars going down. It was literally like the 50s all over again. Total Americana, American flags, muscle cars. It was awesome. Uh, and there we go. I&#39;m one stroke away from the goal. I got to get to to get to high single digit handicap uh within four years. I got to do it by the end of this year. I&#39;ve been playing three and a half years and change. Um 10.9 index. First time with a 10 handle. Clicked over yesterday. had an really hardcore match against my friend Brian. We nine holes. I could only play after the markets closed yesterday. I had and then I had to go back and do more stuff. Uh been one of those kind of weeks. But um uh shot a 40 from the golds and that brought me down to 10.9. So I want to break 80 one time. That&#39;s a goal this year. And I want to get to a 99 or better high single digit handicap. keep praying for me because just by showing this, the golf gods are probably not going to be pleased and humble my butt one more time. Um, but hopefully after the member member this weekend. So, Charlie Munger, you&#39;ll do better if you have passion for something in which you have aptitude. If Warren Buffett had gone into ballet, no one would have heard of him. That&#39;s from Charlie Mer. Uh, and here&#39;s John Templeton. learn every day, but especially from the experience of others, it&#39;s cheaper. Tuition on your own can be very expensive. All right, let&#39;s get down to data. Credit card delinquency rates peaking and starting to roll over. That&#39;s the good news. DHS customs and excise tax taxes monthly billion dollars. You know, when Trump talks about all the money coming into the Treasury, he is not kidding. um you know when he put it on in 2018 it went from four to basically 8 12 doubled the the the tariffs. Now they&#39;re up to 28 billion a month. That&#39;s bringing in a lot of money to the Treasury. Uh let&#39;s hope he doesn&#39;t go overboard and slow things down, but uh it seems like he&#39;s at a really good level that no one ever thought he would accomplish. So uh we&#39;ll see how that goes. Boeing monthly aircraft deliveries went through the roof. I mean, it&#39;s amazing to see. It&#39;s now like $229 and just a couple of months ago, no one would buy it at 135 except for the incredible, amazing people on this podcast. Uh, you took advantage and how you doing? That was a great thing. Historically, all-time highs tend to cluster, so we&#39;re probably due for a lot more. Buying undervalued oil shares seems like a good bet. Hasn&#39;t been this low since 2000. We got a new serer we&#39;re taking a serious look at. And um maybe some EMPS. We do want to get some more. Comp stock&#39;s gone up a lot. It&#39;s resting a little bit. It hasn&#39;t come back enough though to put new money to work, but we&#39;re holding everything we got and happy as a clam. uh S&amp;P 500 price and earnings. So earnings have lagged price according to this, but that&#39;s what bull markets look like. Equities typically rise when Fed resumes cutting. So uh you&#39;re starting to get rumblings about shadow Fed, which would make Powell lame duck. I think we&#39;re going to see it. I think we could be surprised in July if the CPI numbers warrant it. Particularly when you&#39;re seeing all the articles coming out saying the jobs report was weaker than it looked, which is what we said right away. Buying the dip has been a winning strategy this year. No s Sherlock global equity performance and the US dollar. Global equities outperform when what? when the dollar declines. That has been the case. Very unpopular last year except for you guys who listened in and took advantage and and uh and benefited from weaker dollar, stronger international equities. Annualized tariff revenues uh collected through that&#39;s the same chart, but annualized it&#39;s come comes out to $360 billion. That&#39;s pretty serious. Um, and then those gold cards, that&#39;s supposed to be some serious amount of money, like $700 billion if that&#39;s true. So, we&#39;ll see. High yield, you know, that you pay for play, get your citizenship here. Um, high yield, never really priced in a recession. We had focused on that a little bit in some of our data when everyone was afraid. staying private for longer. A lot of companies, what does that do? It creates less supply of public securities, which means the same amount of money. Chasing fewer goods means prices go up. That&#39;s why the indices are going up in addition to global liquidity. Number of days between all-time highs, 913 days since last all-time high for the Russell 2000. You got to go all the way back to the early 2000s was which was the biggest rally in the shortest amount of time in small caps. That is the next rip your face off rally that&#39;s already started. Very excited about that. number of firsttime buyers collapsing compliments of Sha J uh who is sitting on his thumb and um will be replaced uh actually or symbolically either way soon unless he does the right thing in July and has the opportunity to go out like Seinfeld at the top. Private sector jobs growth year-over-year rolling over tax credits available for new car purchases until September 30th, how much interest you can deduct. That&#39;s going to be huge for the next two. If you remember, 10,000 tax deduction on interest for cars made in the US. Hong Kong tops global IPO rankings first half unintended consequence of stupid policy. Those IPOs should be happening in the US. They are happening in Hong Kong instead. Make Hong Kong banks great again. A big Q2 quarter should have bulls smiling. average returns 12 uh uh four quarters out after a 10% plus quarter going back to 1950 is 9.3% compliments of Ryan Dietrich at Carson earnings are expected to remain strong $300 estimates 265 holding up how you doing now those might actually begin to go up we&#39;re beyond the takeown period we&#39;re now in the backend load period sweet spot for the rest of the year uh performance up 5 to 10% at the midpoint of the year on average full year return 13.8 8. We&#39;re at five. That means another eight, which means indices subdued under the surface. Firecrackers. Um, it was amazing how much money has come in this quarter and I thought, man, I&#39;m probably going to be sitting on this for a little while. Market feels a little bit frothy. And then I looked through and I was like, &quot;No, there&#39;s so much to do right now.&quot; Because that rotation under the surface, you&#39;re just seeing the lagard start to get bid and they&#39;re taking off and you and we want to get in while we still have low prices. So, it was exciting to see all the continued opportunity and excited to put the rest to work this this week and in coming days and maybe week to two weeks. Um, some stock now, some options later, etc. Super excited. Qualifying income for a starter home now up to 101,000. Time for positioning chase into small caps. Flow&#39;s still negative despite bounce. Uh you can&#39;t give them away once it&#39;s when they&#39;re up here breaking to new highs. Everyone will be chasing. Same uh story, different date. First half 2025 total return. Poland is leading Greece, Austria, Spain, South Korea, Italy, Germany, Mexico, Brazil, South Africa, Netherlands, China, France, Switzerland, Singapore, Vietnam, United Kingdom, Canada, Japan, Australia, Taiwan, Philippines, followed by the United States. Equity market first half 6.2% among the worst in the c in the world. Uh, only worse is India, which everyone couldn&#39;t get enough of. Malaysia, Indonesia, Saudi Arabia, Turkey, and Thailand being the worst. Maybe we got to look for some stuff in Thailand. Um, so there you go. Once it turns, it turns hard. International outperforming US. US equity underperformance tends to be accompanied by dollar weakness. This has been part of the theme, ladies and gentlemen. And what are we seeing? We are seeing dollar weakness, international equities outperformance, policy uncertainty at all-time highs, but earnings uncertainty close to 5-year lows. So earnings certainty is coming back now that a lot of the chaos is in the rearview mirror. And by the way, to Trump&#39;s credit, that&#39;s the time to do it. The minute you get in the door, you you throw in the kitchen sink and then you um get all the eat the crust first is what mom and dad used to say, right? You don&#39;t like the crust, eat the crust first and you get to the good stuff second. Uh S&amp;P 500 leverage is near record lows. Wait till rates come down and companies starting issuing debt to buy stock and to buy other companies. It&#39;s coming to a theater near you. You know what else has happened, ladies and gentlemen? How about 2001, which has been an analog for a lot of the exciting things that we&#39;re talking about and happening and have been occurring. Dividends should contribute more to total returns than during the last decades. Zerp zero interest rate policy. I&#39;ll tell you what companies don&#39;t have big dividends. Mag seven. I&#39;ll tell you what companies do. the lagards that are starting to rip the shorts faces off and there&#39;s still a window. It&#39;s closing. There&#39;s no question it&#39;s closing. So, kudos to you who got in this quarter. Uh super duper happy for you. It seems like there&#39;s always stuff to do, but sometimes they&#39;re better than others. And uh and I&#39;m just seeing these things start to go now. Like I was like, you know, PayPal jumped up from 58 to 75 and and then I was like I was looking I was like, &quot;God, that&#39;s moved a lot. Do I put new money to work here?&quot; And then I just zoomed out. I was like, &quot;Uh, are you kidding?&quot; Like, &quot;How much money can we put to work?&quot; So, uh, so it wasn&#39;t a hard decision. China and Vietnam export values, exports to the US. China exports to Vietnam have gone up because of the tariffs. Vietnam exports to the US have gone up. And I guess this red line is China. I don&#39;t know why this is not labeled well, but okay. Chart of the day, moderating earnings, and that is 5%. Okay, so this is here&#39;s the name of the game. Expectations are low going into earning season. They&#39;re down from 9.3 to 5.0, which sets the bar low for them to beat. Okay. So, my guess 8 or 9%, I could be wrong, but that&#39;s kind of been the theme and I think that&#39;ll be the theme moving forward. We probably get a early pop in earning season and then people get tired. They check out, they go to the Hamptons, they go play Maidstone and uh Spy Glass and uh all not Spy Glass. Jesus, I&#39;m a West Coast, excuse me, I&#39;m a West Coast guy now. Um National and uh and all the great courses out there. US dollar overall positioning shorting the hole now ladies and gentlemen maybe we get a little counter trend bounce US household ownership stock of stocks as a percent of total assets is knocking on the door that means mag 7 predominantly that&#39;s where they&#39;re all crammed Apple better get his AI game intact Jeff Bezos is selling stock 666 6 million of stock, which is kind of lunch money for him, but at the same time, it&#39;s not nothing. So, uh, just paying attention. But, uh, the Palanteer guys make him look like a because they&#39;re selling like their pants are on fire. At least at least B Bezos is is modest about it. You know, someone&#39;s got to pay for the gas on the yacht, but I mean, these other guys, holy cow. All right. Um, S&amp;P announced buybacks continue to go up. Household leverage percentage. Man, this couldn&#39;t be better. Look how it was before the great great financial crisis. The household balance sheet hasn&#39;t been this healthy since the 1960s and the 1950s. I mean, all that means is rates go down. Either Powell gets out or Powell wakes up and the animal spirits are back. Helocks uh going will be going out of style. your local baseball stadium will be, you know, sponsored by Rocket Mortgage and all of the Enco. Uh S&amp;P companies will be able to relever. Households will be able to relever. Credit expansion will be on boom boom boom into the early 2030s. Price changes for selective market classes year-over-year. Oh, that&#39;s from Cox Automotive.

They have a restaurant at the top of the one. That&#39;s not my cup of tea. Uh new, that thing has just been dead forever. VF Corp, easy to put new money there. That was like a complete no-brainer this week. Super excited about that one. Uh Bracken&#39;s going to be completely fine. It we ran it up to 28. I&#39;m like, &quot;Oh, why didn&#39;t I sell some at 28?&quot; Because I didn&#39;t get in for 28. I got for $50, $80, $100 and Bracken&#39;s going to deliver. It&#39;s just off on the tariff BS. It will be fine. He&#39;s already told you in the last conference call. He&#39;s got it solved. Market&#39;s pricing in 150 cost. He&#39;s like, &quot;No, we&#39;re going to we&#39;re going to manage that. This is one more bite at the apple before we go.&quot; And we&#39;ve been to this movie before with other names and they just took off. So, uh, so that&#39;s that. American Airlines maybe.

You know it&#39;s funny. I had a lot of customers, clients call me and thank me for that call I did for clients on that Monday, April 7th. I did a 30-minute call. I said, &quot;Now&#39;s the time. Put in money if you&#39;re thinking about putting in money.&quot; And we just rocked it. And I said, you know, as amazing as we did because of that, I&#39;m looking across the portfolio and the big moves haven&#39;t even started yet. I mean, it&#39;s unbelievable. Um, one, how we&#39;ve been able to do and two, what we&#39;re going to do is my view. And, um, I couldn&#39;t be more excited, especially putting new money to work. I was just like, &quot;Wow, I can&#39;t believe there&#39;s still so much to do.&quot; Disconnect between that won&#39;t be the case uh, for long. But then there&#39;ll be like defenses of there&#39;s always something, but there&#39;s sometimes that are just easy pickings and we&#39;re still kind of there even though the wind windows closing quickly. Uh Russell 1000 Stokes stocks in the first half of 2025. We covered that disconnect between Wow, that&#39;s amazing. Yeah, they really did buy the worst stock. Fed expectations in equity markets. US cyclicals versus defensives. There are some defensives getting sold off here. Forward swap rate. I wish this went back a little farther. Okay. Risk appetite starting to pick up. Not at extreme. Again, I think there&#39;s more room here in the next few weeks, even for the general indices, which means these MAG7s trade to the top of the range. What&#39;s your sector outlook for the next 30 days? So, everyone&#39;s bullish on financials. Opinion and uh tech opinion follows trend. No one wants discretionary. No one wants the VF corpse, the Nikes, uh the goose, the geese. Uh they want they don&#39;t want energy. They don&#39;t want real estate. Even CCI I I like here. here. I like that rates kind of backed off a little bit. Um I think CCI at 100 makes a lot of sense. S&amp;P sector level bottom up target price versus closing price. Healthc care has the biggest spread between current price and target price in aggregate. There&#39;s opportunity there. Highest level of multif family completion since 1986. They&#39;re chasing the the dog is chasing the tail. They&#39;re looking at what worked yesterday, creating supply, that&#39;s going to be the glut of tomorrow, multif family is going to glut like nobody&#39;s business. And um as more supply comes on for single family, as Trump opens the 512,000 acres, as the incentives from the big beautiful bill go into effect, 5,000 new home buyers, all the other advantages, rates come down in spite of Powell. Despite Powell, first half asset class returns and drawdowns. US dollar weakest opening first half. No one expected except the people, the great people of the hedge fund tips with Tom Hayes community. Um, US small caps tough time on their way to the promised land. Emerging what else? Cash did poor.

Instead, we gave it to China or Hong Kong. Calls grow for China&#39;s household sector to be bigger economic driver. That&#39;s going to benefit Baba. China June car sales hit record for the month on subsidy boost. It&#39;s funny. Western investors get so nervous when the government do does negative things, but when they do positive things, they don&#39;t believe they&#39;re going to work. You can&#39;t make this stuff up. But that&#39;s fine. Gave us more opportunity. By the way, first time in a long time that we&#39;ve been able to put new money to work in Alibaba, which is super exciting. I I never thought it was going to get to a point where I&#39;d want to put new money again. Uh just ride it to the promised land. It gave us another bite at the apple. You know, I was talking with a a just a great client of mine, by the way. And um you know I said to him I said look there&#39;s no invisible force but I got to say like if I was running the world this is exactly what I would have the chart do to to just screw all the people who wouldn&#39;t buy it at 60 bought it at 148 just completely destroy them until the next move straight to 200. And that&#39;s exactly what&#39;s happened. He&#39;s like he&#39;s like I agree with you on both counts. You know number one there&#39;s no invisible hand. Number two it&#39;s acting exactly the way it should. and he&#39;s a super smart guy. Finance background, business builder background.

It&#39;s sitting there smiling and saying, &quot;Come on, buy me. You know, I&#39;m going to 200, baby.&quot; And I&#39;m saying, &quot;Yeah, I know, but like you you you know, you got to calm down. You&#39;ve had a good run here in the last couple of months. Plenty of gas left in the tank. Stock market and sentiment results article of the week. Comto stock resources update. Each week we try to cover one to two companies we&#39;ve discussed in previous podcast video cast for our own clients, including personally I eat my own cooking. Ladies and gentlemen, in late 2023, we came out publicly with a new position in Comtock Resources, a name that had been left for dead and one you practically couldn&#39;t give away. A combination of record domestic natural gas We actually we actually went in earlier than that, Jeff. I know there&#39;s no articles on the site, but we went in on the podcast. Anyway, the point is your price is correct because we we wrote it up, if I&#39;m not mistaken, we wrote it up to 20 and then it came back down. We we loaded a lot more and our basis is now high eights, low nines across the board. Then it ran up to 31. Now it&#39;s breathing for a little bit. Um, combination of record domestic natural production, flooding inventories, milder weather, lowering demand, and being blindsided by policies slowing LNG export projects crushed the stock and sent natural gas prices to their lowest inflation adjusted levels since they began trading on the NY in 1990. We saw this as an opportunity and started adding around $8 a share basis. That&#39;s correct. getting our hands on as many shares as we could as the stock drifted lower into the $7 range. That&#39;s correct. And two things stood out to us that made Comtock a no-brainer. First, we were investing Perry Pu with Jerry Jones. While he&#39;s best known as the owner of the Dallas Cowboys, if you realize he built his initial fortune in the oil and gas business and now controls 71% of the entire company, his track record speaks for itself. And in public interviews, he&#39;s openly stated that his oil and gas interests are worth well more than the Dallas Cowboys, aka the most valuable uh sports team in the whole world at nearly 11 billion. We agree. Second, Comtock is the lowest cost producer with a cost structure that&#39;s 48% lower than pure averages. We believe in the long-term natural gas theme, and Comtock is undoubtedly the most efficiently run pure play in the space. In other words, they perform peers when prices are in the doldrums and when the cycle inevitably turns, they have the greatest operating leverage. The best part, and something that wasn&#39;t even baked into our original investment thesis, is that while prices were in the gutter and much of the industry was hiding under their desks in the fetal position, Comtock was quietly playing offense looking for the next big drilling opportunity. management spent the last 5 years studying geologic data and signing over 20,000 new drilling leases across a massive 520,000 netacre footprint in the western Hannesville region. This region is still virtually undeveloped with management calling it the holy grail because they expect it to yield significantly more resource potential per section than their legacy Hannesville assets with potential for thousands of future drilling locations. For context, legacy Hanesville region has 1300 net locations and 94 net producing wells across 302,000 acres. Western Hesville covers 520,000 net acres, but currently only has 19 producing wells. By all means, this is very early days. Meanwhile, it&#39;s perfectly situated about Isn&#39;t it exciting to take a stock that had a three and a half four bagger and it&#39;s very early days? Meanwhile, it&#39;s perfectly situated about 100 miles from both Houston and Dallas prime locations for future data centers that management is already in discussions for. This is on top of its proximity to the Gulf of America, which is home to more than hundred billion dollar in LG terminals and continues to rapidly expand. With LG capacity growing and AI and data centers driving electricity demand to record levels, the real question over the next few years will be where will all the natural gas come from? Comtock will happily be there to answer just that. Chat GPT queries are six to 10 times as power intensive as traditional Google searches. US electricity consumption from the EIA 1990 to 2026 is up close to 60%. US Henry Hub natural gas spot price going up. Oh, and by the way, this is all happening while managers are still sitting near record low allocation to the energy sector. This move will be hated on the way up and chased when it&#39;s too late. We will be smiling so wide we could eat a banana sideways. Global energy. Here&#39;s institutional quote unquote smart money positioning. Going to miss the boat again. One standard deviation below its long-term average. And here are some uh highlights from the earnings. Operating cash flow was 239 million. all the numbers, all the metrics going up. You can go to hedge funips.com. While you&#39;re there, click on terms. This is all opinion, not advice. Money management, we&#39;re closing today. So, if you didn&#39;t get in today, um, at least put your name in today. Uh, you got to wait till next quarter. If you&#39;re the small accounts of a million to five million, if you&#39;re the normal accounts of five or 10 million or more, you can come in whenever you damn please. We&#39;ll pick up the phone and you can just say, &quot;I just called to say I love you and we will happily uh uh accommodate you at your convenience.&quot; Moving along here, you can see the free cash flow gains year onear, the net net income gains, the oil and gas sales, Ebidax, etc. Natural gas price realizations going up, great liquidity through 2029, 2030. Good balance sheet, huge opportunity. Uh in Western Hannesville drilling results, laterals going wider and wider, more output for less cost, lowest cost producer by a mile. Look at this. They&#39;re there eight competitors. The nearest one, they&#39;re at 83 cents. Their nearest one is at 95% 95 cents. And the worst, the eighth one is at 272. Best-in-class cost structure of gas producers. PV10 value worth 5.7 billion. It&#39;s nothing compared to the unproved reserves that we&#39;re talking about here, which is probably another 10 to 20 years of um untapped or unrecorded assets can go through the conference call and I would suggest you do. It&#39;s funny, someone said to me, well, you can now you can just summarize all of them with chat GPT. I said, great. I hope you do that because you&#39;re never going to get the nuance and really understand and you&#39;re never you&#39;re going to lose all the edge. So summarize away and we will do the work. Alibaba update. A few weeks ago, Alibaba released its annual letter to shareholders despite the price action which we welcomed as it gave us a chance to put new money to work for the first time in a while. The biggest takeaway is that the business continues to fire on all cylinders. Nothing we didn&#39;t already know, but here are a few highlights worth noting. International commerce remains on track to achieve its first profitable quarter in the coming fiscal year. Other profit previously loss-making businesses are now on track to reach profitability. Revenue from AI related products post posted tripledigit growth for seven consecutive quarters. This is the cheapest best AI play in the world. I&#39;ll repeat it. Revenue from AI related products posted tripledigit growth for seven consecutive quarters, helping drive overall cloud revenue back into doubledigit growth. Number one cloud player, number one retailer to the middle class. International growth booming. Management repurchased 11.9 billion worth of shares during the year, reducing the share count by 5.1%. That was on top of 4 billion in dividends and special dividends paid during the year with another 4.6 billion in dividends already announced for the current year. Alibaba reigns the number one e-commerce platform in China with total e-commerce now making up nearly 27% of retail consumption and reaching over 1.1 billion internet users. Management is doubling down on instant commerce offering nearly 7 billion in coupons over the next year to gain share. Daily orders have already reached 80 million and twice daily active users have passed 200 million greater around 40% of market share in just three months. Sentiment is getting a little bit too greedy. So maybe we get a little pause in the rally. And congrats to everyone who came in this quarter. Very excited for you. Very grateful to have you on board. Defense and Aerospace earnings estimates, revisions, top 30 weights, revisions in the last 60 days for this year up 86 bips. Next year up 90 pips, almost 1%. Energy down up down ratio. Oh, sorry. Uh down 1.68% and 2026 down 2.09%. Let&#39;s take a look at some economic data. Small business optimism still pretty high, little less than expectations. Consumer credit is low lower that you we got to bring those rates down to get some credit expansion to make this thing hum. Welcome to capitalism. And we got initial and continuing tomorrow. And then we got some inflation I believe next week which is going to be the key numbers. C CPI on Tuesday that&#39;ll be right before I go on Vney. PPI on Wednesday. Retail sales on Thursday. Busy week. We talked about earnings expectations. So we got that. Let&#39;s move on to ask me anything questions. We got quite a few great ones this week. Let&#39;s uh hear from the first person who first name is common, last name is sense. Haha. Um last 30 days PDD is up 3% while Baba is down 15%. Is there something to be concerned about? uh your investment framework is to be concerned about. Um you&#39;re focused on price versus value and uh and that&#39;s how you wind up getting flushed out of great stocks and tempted by mediocre stocks. So beware. Um question, what do you say about Arrow Electronics? I&#39;m guessing this is not going to be something that fits in our framework, but let me be open-minded. I&#39;m uh this is likely a new listener. So, welcome to the podcast. Yeah, this is this is something that&#39;s already double off the lows and now wants me to look at it. So, first off, I&#39;d like to welcome you to Hedge Fund Tips with Tom Hayes. Uh you&#39;re going to learn a lot. I hope you&#39;ll tune in every week and um and you&#39;ll learn a different framework and and you&#39;ll see whether you&#39;re genetically made up to invest in this way or if you want to follow a different strategy. There are plenty of ways to make money. Uh but we do the one that works consistently for us and for our clients and we don&#39;t chase things that have already run. But I&#39;ll tell you what I think generically from a trading and positioning standpoint. I would never buy it here from in general. No, I mean revenues are falling off a cliff here. Uh, and price is near all-time highs. So, right, I I I&#39;m not going to spend a lot of time on this one. I&#39;m just going to pass. It&#39;s probably an okay business, but it&#39;s priced in what it&#39;s already doing. FBI, great question, by the way. I hope you have more in the future. FBI, Fortune Brands. This is interesting. Okay. So, price just followed cash flow. Let me do something else here. FBI N. Okay. So cash flow collapsed for a little while. Revenues have been flat to down for a while. Margins are starting to tick up. [Music] Home and security products for residential home repair, remodeling, security applications, water, outdoor security, faucets, accessories, kitchen, sinks, waste supply. So, it&#39;s a housing play. Decking I I think this is probably okay. Let&#39;s see. Master lockdeatic doors. Yeah, I kind of like this. probably down on the tariff nonsense, but the demand is going to be so big. I don&#39;t know if the upside&#39;s big enough for me to get attracted, but this thing&#39;s going to trade up. This is definitely going to trade up. And I think that you have done a good job, Mr. John Garvey, Lee Foster, what do you think about valet stepping uh stepping on Albamaro&#39;s toes in the material space which I have a position by the way? Albamar is starting to rock, isn&#39;t it? [Music] 70 bucks up from 50. We&#39;re on our way. And so you look at these things, it&#39;s like, God, it&#39;s moved 20 bucks. But then you zoom out and you&#39;re like, yeah, and it&#39;s just getting started, homeboy. Like, all right. So, you got to buy it up 10 bucks. So, so what? Uh, what do you think about valet? Do you think iron ore is close to bottoming? Good chance of a double from here. I&#39;ve never liked valet. I don&#39;t like Valet. I don&#39;t like Tinto. I do like Albamar though. Uh let&#39;s just see. Yeah, I I just don&#39;t like it. I don&#39;t like it. I have and when I answer quickly, it&#39;s not like because I&#39;m not doing like I&#39;ve I&#39;ve I&#39;ve studied the business many times over the last 20 years. So like I I just don&#39;t like the business. Phil Truck, hey Tom, 26 years old, been a listener over a year now. All right. Awesome. Phil, you have truly you truly have been life-changing with your opinion, not advice. Thank you. Thank you for all you do. uh what I gathered star was about 62.2 2 million that&#39;s annualized first half 2025 if we get something equal to or greater for second half we didn&#39;t apply $4 base case uh it could be in that neighborhood I think at some point you know $35 a share we&#39;re already starting to price in $3 of earnings we&#39;re not there yet um so Look, they&#39;re doing everything that they can control. All we got to do is focus on the volumes. And if the volumes come from getting Powell under control, Bessant doing what he&#39;s going to do with the 10-year and the big beautiful bill tax deduction for interest payments on US cars. I think it&#39;s going to boom. I mean, and I think when it turns, it&#39;s not going to be like two, three, four over the next three years. I think it&#39;s going to be like 3 and a half 610 dollars a share in earnings and everyone&#39;s what the hell happened and on the catchup the multiple expand from eight times to 15 or 20 times and we&#39;ll make a lot more money than we&#39;ve even already made. So uh so that&#39;s that good question. Griffin Brown, what are your thoughts on the possibility of AI taking over entry-level analyst and research roles? Should young aspiring analysts be deterred from the field because of this, or do you think it&#39;s just noise? Uh, you know, I tell most kids or young people, go build a business in your 20s and you&#39;ll either get rich or you&#39;ll fail in your 20s, in which case you can always go get a job. Uh, if you really love it and you think you&#39;re smarter than the average bear, I would do it because if you&#39;re exceptional, you&#39;ll do fine regardless. Um, I do think it&#39;s going to have an impact on on that aspect of the business. Uh, it&#39;s going to be way more competitive. You&#39;re going to have to be better, but the ones who are really good will never have any competition. Robots are not. Uh, because there&#39;s some intangibles that the robots can&#39;t replicate. But the problem is is it takes many years to build those intangibles. So I would say follow your passion at the very least you&#39;re going to learn the language of business which is accounting and understanding financials and if the industry gets tougher and you can&#39;t meet your goals doing what you thought you wanted to do you&#39;ll have a great financial background to do anything you want to do. So um follow your passion. If you&#39;re exclusively going in because you think that&#39;s the way you can make the most amount of money in the shortest period of time. I think you have a better chance of getting rich in your 20s and 30s building a business. Uh but if you grind it out by your 40s, you can make more money than you know you could ever possibly imagine because you&#39;ll be that good that you will be generating the value in the marketplace that warrants making exceptional amounts of money. And in your 20s and 30s, it&#39;s very low probability. So, if you&#39;re taking the long view because you love it and you&#39;re willing to eat dirt for 10 years, then have at it. Uh, and you should do it. But if it&#39;s like, I just want to get rich and drive a nice car, like build a business. David T, can you take a look at WFRD? Possibly better than SLB as far as turnaround is concerned. WFR D. Oh, the old Weatherford. I forgot why I hate this business, but let&#39;s take a look at it. Maybe it was a bankruptcy reorg. WFRD? Yeah, looks like it was a bankruptcy reorg. Maybe they&#39;ll get it right this time. But there&#39;s probably some of the same actors involved. I would check that out. I n don&#39;t take the second prettiest girl in the in the ugliest industry. Take the prettiest girl to the prom. Eric F. Dear Mr. Hayes, I&#39;ve listened to the podcast for about four months. I really admire your persistent optimistic outlook on opportunities in the market. Does your optimism extend from a viewpoint there&#39;s always a turnaround opportunity somewhere or are there times during your career when you&#39;re not so optimistic and perhaps neutral or even bearish? Many times I&#39;ve been super bearish um and um when it was justified and the right time to to be so. It hasn&#39;t been and it&#39;s not going to be more likely for for some time. Yeah, you&#39;re going to get some chop in the fall. Suck it up, buttercup, but we&#39;re going to resolve higher before the end of the year. Unfortunately, there are not enough hours in the day to review all your past episodes to understand how your outlook has changed through the years in different market environments. Thanks, ARGF. So, I hope I answered your question. Um, there are not enough hours in a day. So, there are 168 hours in a week. I&#39;ve done 299 episodes. So, it would take you four weeks to learn 40% of what I&#39;ve learned in 20 years if you wanted to make it a career. But, um, don&#39;t do that. It&#39;s too hard. Matthew Gy on the podcast, you can speak your thoughts on investing the S&amp;P right now given very high valuations. All right. Your numbers are wrong, but your thesis is correct. Do you think it&#39;s time to sell? I don&#39;t know. I mean, when you&#39;re asking me about the S&amp;P 500, you&#39;re asking me about MAG 7. I don&#39;t have a view. We&#39;re not correlated to the S&amp;P. Yes, if the market goes down a lot, our our names will be hit. But if the market grinds sideway, we&#39;re going to we&#39;re going to make a killing. So, I that&#39;s kind of my base case. Sideways, maybe five to 10% pullbacks in the fall. Uh but being in the right names, it&#39;s not not even going to matter. I don&#39;t I don&#39;t even think about the indices. That&#39;s like that&#39;s the farthest thing from my mind. I just look at on a business by business basis. If JP Morgan was going to underwrite me buying 100% of the business, the only catch was I had to put a 100% of my net worth as the equity. So, if I&#39;m right, I make 20x on a double or whatever. And if I&#39;m wrong, they get the whole business and I get wiped out. If the answer is yes, I would do that deal, then I make it a position. If the answer is no, why would I even buy one share? So, um, as far as buying the S&amp;P, it&#39;s like asking me, do I like vanilla ice cream? I mean, no, man. I like Graham Central Station at Handles in Orange County. They got a few of them. They&#39;ve got Irvine, they got Newport, they got Huntington Beach. Best ice cream you&#39;ll ever have. Never thought I would like it, but I asked the guy, &quot;What&#39;s the number one number three sellers?&quot; He said, &quot;Cookie Monster, Grand Central Station, and something else I would never eat.&quot; So, pass on the blue Cookie Monster. Tried the Grand Central Station. Worst thing I ever did because unfortunately, I can walk there. And if I walk there and get Grand Central Station, I better walk 18 holes the next day. Uh, Joseph Gualtieri, would you take a look at Jack? Been looking at Jack every week for many weeks and I want to buy it and I&#39;m not going to because it&#39;s a mediocre business. It&#39;s on the West Coast. We&#39;re probably a little over restauranted, but this thing seems to have nine lives. So, I think you&#39;re going to be right and I think I&#39;m not going to participate. But in the meantime, let&#39;s take a look. Jack, who&#39;s this guy? Joseph Gualtieri. A guy after my own heart. What are we doing here? Cash flow starting to recovery. Margins are okay. Returns on capital have been crap. Turnaround story. So, just tell me what the turnaround is. That&#39;s all I want to know. You&#39;re tempting me, but you&#39;re not exciting me. Um, take a look at the balance sheet. Better look at it quarterly because it&#39;s not looking good annual. Not a lot of cash. You got 1.6 billion of debt and 75 million in cash. That&#39;s not good, my friend. And that&#39;s probably why I keep passing on it. I mean, they&#39;ll probably do some cockamame raise now that the market&#39;s up, but that&#39;s a binary event. They&#39;ve got 19 million shares. Outstanding. 5 million shares at 20 bucks. They raise 100 million. They dilute you 20%. They live another day. It&#39;s probably pricing in some dilution. Just tell me how they&#39;re how&#39;s the business going to turn around? Do they have new products? Last time I checked, they&#39;re just trying to sell everything under the sun, throwing against, excuse my language, against the wall and hoping something sticks. I think something&#39;s going to stick. I&#39;ve eaten there before. It&#39;s okay. I I don&#39;t know. I think you&#39;re going to be right on this one, but I think you really got to do some work on it. I do think you&#39;re going to be right. Just instinct, but like as far as risking my and other people&#39;s money on it before doing a ton of work, no. Maybe I&#39;ll go listen to a few conference calls and take a look. But yeah, it keeps showing up on my list and I keep probably because I keep worrying about solveny risk, but uh yeah, I gota maybe dig a little deeper. It&#39;s in the discretionary category. I like that. Bob Atkins asks about Kagra C A. [Music] Uh let&#39;s see. Love these defensives getting smacked. What is this? This is not my thing. C A G I think you&#39;re on the right track. What do these guys make again? It&#39;s a food business. It&#39;s kind of like packaged foods. This is like the most hated group in the world right now. Packaged foods with uh RFK Jr., Bird&#39;s Eye, Merry Calendar, Duncan Hind, Healthy Choice, Slim Gym, Ready Whip, Boom, Chicka Pop Brands, Incorporated in 1919. Wake me up at $17 a share. I may never get it. Let&#39;s take a look at the balance sheet. I prefer Hormell, but let&#39;s just take a look. Manual. This is Yeah. So, this is probably your issue. No, this this is a problem. I&#39;m not sure how they solve for this, but they got $7.2 billion of debt and $77 million of cash. I mean, they&#39;ve been running like that for a while, but 1.6 billion of free cash flow last year. I think it&#39;s worth doing some work on. It&#39;s not for me. It has to get a lot lower, but I like the idea. Alex Co, great podcast. Thanks for sharing your knowledge every week. Will needing if you think Adobe is bottoming out and worth a look. I&#39;m not in love with any software stocks right now because I don&#39;t know how AI is going to affect them. That&#39;s always been like why Buffett&#39;s, you know, you just changes I I think you&#39;re probably going to be okay with that. I think I&#39;m probably not interested in it right now. They&#39;re doing fine. I mean, it&#39;s like Google search. It&#39;s like they&#39;re great until they&#39;re not or they&#39;re great period and it&#39;s an over overwhelming fear that goes in my two hard box. I don&#39;t know enough about the software and the moat. I understand creators use it and it&#39;s the thing and blah blah blah, but I don&#39;t I don&#39;t even know what I don&#39;t know about how AI is going to disrupt that. I do know they&#39;re not going to disrupt putting tar shingles on roofs with QXO and Brad Jacobs. They&#39;re just going to make them more efficient and bring more profits to the bottom line. Eduardo Gonzalez, want to thank you for all the great information on the content podcast. A longtime follower, thank you. And now I can&#39;t wait every week to watch your new podcast for the week. I work on the oil field since 2008. Awesome. Star investing 2019. Go with the flow. I found you and heard you were pounding the table on banks when no one wanted them. invested in focus. Thank you for all you do. Can&#39;t be one of your clients yet. Don&#39;t have a million bucks. Okay. Uh ask you about Brazilian company Petro. Is it worth it to take a look? Yes, Petro Boss is always worth it to take a look except when Lula is in power and could cut the dividend any day he wants. He probably won&#39;t. It&#39;s run too much. I think your better play right now is some of the highest quality servicesers. Mark Thompson, could you take a look at Yeti? We&#39;ve looked at Yeti many times. Good business, good price, probably okay. Consumer discretionary, beat to death, will bounce back. the Louis Vuitton of ice coolers for rednecks and people like me who like to go to parades on the 4th of July. Uh it&#39;s not there&#39;s not a lot not to love here. Obviously got ahead of itself during co I think you&#39;re okay with this one. I I&#39;ve looked at it a million times. I haven&#39;t pulled the trigger yet because we have discretionary exposure, but I think you&#39;re right, Mark. Jerome Parker BXMT Blackstone Office. Uh, it&#39;s not an office read. It&#39;s a mortgage trust. So, pass. Completely opaque. Henry Dubil, huge fan of the podcast. Been spreading the good word on hedge fund tips to friends and family. Thank you for that. By the way, if you&#39;re getting value and you can&#39;t afford to become a client, what I suggest or ask you to do is leave a kind comment in the YouTube comments or leave any comment, kind or not. Uh that helps more people get exposed to the video. More people that get exposed to the video, the longer we&#39;re going to do this for non-clients. and um share the word. Share it with one person you love who you know loves the markets but doesn&#39;t know what the hell they&#39;re doing and hopefully we can help them out. Curious if you have any thoughts on Charter Communications trading at 50% off the 2021 high blah blah blah. Uh your guess is as good as mine on Charter. I continue to look at it. Continued to do nothing. It&#39;s gone up while I&#39;ve continued to do nothing. I just I can&#39;t really get excited about linear. Even the high speed, there&#39;s going to be some disruption in rural areas. Uh, no. I think you&#39;re right, but I&#39;m not interested. Manny B. CNC CNC got smashed on the surprise Medicaid cuts in the big beautiful bill. Uh I think you got to listen to the next call and hear what management has to say about there&#39;s a Rosie tomorrow. But for the time being, all these institutional players are smashed. It&#39;s going to take a while to build a new holder base. They&#39;ve had a huge run on Obamacare. You can see the stock went bananas since Obama got in power. Little bit of a break under Trump and continuation under Biden. Seems like that day is over. At at some price, it gets very attractive. I think it&#39;s early as a major long-term holding as a trade. It probably gets a bounce in the next couple of months now that the bad news is out. Uh, I think you keep your eyes on it. Right now, it&#39;s a falling knife, but I like your style, Martin Grizz Grizzki. Martin Grizzy Wazooi, what are your thoughts on We just covered Santine. There you go. Uh, two people had the same question. Thank you for sending it in. Robert, following your podcast from Germany. Greetings. You have a long reach. I don&#39;t have saved enough that Great Hill Capital could take care of my portfolio. I&#39;m wondering if you would accept clients from overseas. Well, why don&#39;t you give me a call after you save the money and we&#39;ll see if we can make that work. But in the meantime, I&#39;m grateful for you tuning in and getting some value out of the podcast and improving your understanding of markets. Do you think if now would be a good time to invest in health tech ETF? Is the MCI World Healthcare and ETF you would recommend? I don&#39;t really recommend ETFs. I like XBI now because rates are going to come down. I&#39;ve liked XBI for a while. It hasn&#39;t done anything, but it&#39;s going to start doing stuff now. It&#39;s just been grinding sideways. We&#39;re going to the promised land. Ah, detour. Going to the promised land. I think now we&#39;re actually going to go uh Msei World Healthcare. MSCI World Health. Oh, this is like a German thing. I think it&#39;s Let&#39;s just XLV. Yeah, I think you I think you buy the biotech basket. That&#39;s going to give you the biggest bang for the buck. If you&#39;re going to do healthcare, you got to pick discreet names. We&#39;ve talked about a bunch of them over the weeks, but I think your your thinking is correct. You&#39;re buying what&#39;s out of favor. Uh this is Jim coming in. We already talked your setup. I think you&#39;re if you&#39;re not approved, you&#39;re almost approved. Um okay. So, that&#39;s that. With that said, we&#39;ll be back next week. Same time, same place. We&#39;ll actually be back in California by next week. We&#39;re quick trip Thursday to Wednesday and uh that will be episode 300. How exciting is that? 300 episodes, almost six years. Super grateful for this incredible audience. Uh super grateful to hear the amazing stories. Matter of fact, my assistant Jennifer had her pulling all the testimonials from emails and from uh comments and all the like. She&#39;s got, you know, if you go to hedgefundtips.com and you click on number one podcast and you see all the people who have bought hedge fun tips with Tom Hayes merch. Uh, but beyond that, you see like 30 pages of testimonials. Look at all these awesome people. And then you just see tons and tons of testimonials. Well, I finally I got her to pull together another 20 pages of testimonials. So, we&#39;re going to have those there as well. So grateful for you guys. Uh we&#39;ll be back next week. In the meantime, make it a great one. Bye for now. [Music] Heat. Heat. [Music] [Music] Heat. Heat. [Music] [Music]
