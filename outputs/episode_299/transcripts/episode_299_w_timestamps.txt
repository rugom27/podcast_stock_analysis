[0.719s] Welcome to Hedge Fund Tips with Tom
[3.04s] Hayes. I&#39;m Tom Hayes and this is your
[5.52s] 299th videocast podcast for the week
[8.72s] ending July 9th, 2025. Hope everyone&#39;s
[12.559s] having a great summer. Had a great
[14.559s] Independence Day. Uh we&#39;ll get started
[17.039s] with some social and family photos. Then
[18.88s] we&#39;ll get right down to business. Uh my
[20.96s] goal is this could be our first oneh
[23.84s] hour podcast in a long time. Uh don&#39;t
[27.039s] get used to it. Next week I&#39;m in New
[28.72s] York doing TV. We&#39;re going to have a lot
[30.48s] of content, but we got a lot of good
[32.239s] AMAs this week, so it might wind up
[34.079s] going over an hour. Famous last words. I
[36.96s] got my hedge fund tips
[39.28s] t-shirt on. You can get it on the
[41.12s] website. But first, I want to thank
[44.559s] Matio Tritnik from Slovenia, Montenegro,
[48.559s] Croatia. He&#39;s got houses all over the
[50.32s] place. Very successful businessman. But
[52.559s] more important than that, he&#39;s got his
[54.16s] BF Corp Timberland gear on. He went to
[57.36s] visit the Timberland store in Irvine.
[59.84s] While he was here, he&#39;s visiting with
[61.44s] his beautiful family, doing Disney,
[64.159s] doing San Diego, doing Orange County,
[67.28s] doing Los Angeles, the whole entire
[69.76s] coast of California. And where did we go
[72.64s] for dinner? Uh, of course we went for
[75.28s] steak at a restaurant on Pacific Coast
[78.96s] Highway in Newport and had an incredible
[81.68s] time talking business, markets, life uh,
[85.6s] and uh, sharing his success stories and
[88.24s] how how he uh, created multiple
[90.56s] successful businesses. It was just an
[92.479s] awesome time and uh, very grateful for
[94.799s] that. So, thanks for that. Uh, then got
[97.52s] to take uh, Annabelle and Caitlyn. Mimi
[101.36s] was still in Croatia. amazing place. If
[104.159s] you&#39;re ever in Newport, go to Ocean 48.
[107.84s] Uh, blew my mind. And I&#39;ve been to a lot
[110.88s] of good restaurants. Get the, uh,
[113.36s] chicken fried lobster tail appetizer and
[116.32s] the crab and all that stuff. There&#39;s
[118.24s] some of my buddies uh, playing. There&#39;s
[120.24s] Kenny owns half of Huntington Beach. Uh,
[123.04s] my buddy Garrett, what a stick. Can fly
[125.52s] pretty much any air vehicle, commercial
[127.68s] pilot. And Ryan&#39;s got the best pizza
[130.399s] places. He also has an AI company, but
[132.56s] as a hobby, he&#39;s got the best pizza on
[134.319s] the West Coast at RIIP
[137.2s] uh in Huntington Beach, and we went
[138.64s] there after I played. Uh this is the
[140.879s] pizza. That&#39;s Caitlyn and Annabel. Uh
[144.48s] thanks to my friend Daryl. Had us out to
[147.28s] uh Newport Beach Country Club for a
[149.599s] scholarship tournament. There&#39;s I call
[152.239s] them Rick the Stick. Uh John and Jesse,
[155.76s] we had an incredible time out there. And
[158.48s] here are some pictures of Mimi in
[159.84s] Croatia. Um
[163.12s] uh and she just got back, by the way.
[165.519s] That&#39;s why the podcast is a little late.
[167.04s] I was so excited to see her. That&#39;s our
[170.0s] uh Fourth of July. Uh was
[175.04s] it was not as good of a weekend as it
[176.8s] seemed. I got whammed with a ton of
[179.04s] unexpected administration stuff I had to
[181.28s] deal with. No bueno. But I did carve out
[184.48s] time for the family to enjoy. That&#39;s
[186.879s] Rick Caruso&#39;s yacht in the background,
[188.959s] by the way. Those of you West Coasters,
[190.64s] big real estate guy, REIT guy, and um at
[194.4s] our friends at David&#39;s house. Uh had a
[197.28s] wonderful time. That&#39;s Annabelle on the
[199.519s] uh kayak.
[201.519s] Uh more pictures from Croatia. That&#39;s
[204.64s] the uh parade in town was pretty
[207.36s] incredible with my friend Tony and
[209.519s] Caitlyn obviously right there, my
[211.36s] beautiful wife as you know. And then
[213.84s] they had these muscle cars going down.
[216.159s] It was literally like the 50s all over
[218.72s] again. Total Americana, American flags,
[222.0s] muscle cars. It was awesome. Uh, and
[226.239s] there we go. I&#39;m one stroke away from
[227.92s] the goal. I got to get to to get to high
[230.319s] single digit handicap uh within four
[232.799s] years. I got to do it by the end of this
[234.56s] year. I&#39;ve been playing three and a half
[235.92s] years and change.
[238.08s] Um 10.9 index. First time with a 10
[241.36s] handle. Clicked over yesterday. had an
[244.4s] really hardcore match against my friend
[247.519s] Brian. We nine holes. I could only play
[250.239s] after the markets closed yesterday. I
[251.84s] had and then I had to go back and do
[253.28s] more stuff. Uh been one of those kind of
[255.76s] weeks. But um uh shot a 40 from the
[259.519s] golds and that brought me down to 10.9.
[265.12s] So I want to break 80 one time. That&#39;s a
[267.52s] goal this year. And I want to get to a
[269.36s] 99 or better high single digit handicap.
[272.32s] keep praying for me because just by
[274.479s] showing this, the golf gods are probably
[276.639s] not going to be pleased and humble my
[279.199s] butt one more time. Um, but hopefully
[282.88s] after the member member this weekend.
[285.12s] So, Charlie Munger, you&#39;ll do better if
[287.199s] you have passion for something in which
[288.88s] you have aptitude. If Warren Buffett had
[291.28s] gone into ballet, no one would have
[293.68s] heard of him. That&#39;s from Charlie Mer.
[296.56s] Uh, and here&#39;s John Templeton. learn
[298.88s] every day, but especially from the
[300.479s] experience of others, it&#39;s cheaper.
[303.84s] Tuition on your own can be very
[306.72s] expensive.
[308.32s] All right, let&#39;s get down to data.
[310.24s] Credit card delinquency rates peaking
[312.32s] and starting to roll over. That&#39;s the
[314.24s] good news. DHS customs and excise tax
[318.479s] taxes monthly billion dollars. You know,
[320.72s] when Trump talks about all the money
[322.08s] coming into the Treasury, he is not
[323.84s] kidding.
[325.44s] um you know when he put it on in 2018 it
[329.12s] went from four to basically
[332.96s] 8 12 doubled the the the tariffs. Now
[336.4s] they&#39;re up to 28 billion a month. That&#39;s
[339.36s] bringing in a lot of money to the
[340.639s] Treasury. Uh let&#39;s hope he doesn&#39;t go
[342.639s] overboard and slow things down, but uh
[344.96s] it seems like he&#39;s at a really good
[346.639s] level that no one ever thought he would
[348.0s] accomplish. So uh we&#39;ll see how that
[350.72s] goes. Boeing monthly aircraft deliveries
[353.28s] went through the roof. I mean, it&#39;s
[356.32s] amazing to see. It&#39;s now like $229 and
[359.52s] just a couple of months ago, no one
[361.52s] would buy it at 135 except for the
[364.24s] incredible, amazing people on this
[365.84s] podcast. Uh, you took advantage and how
[369.12s] you doing? That was a great thing.
[372.08s] Historically, all-time highs tend to
[373.84s] cluster, so we&#39;re probably due for a lot
[376.72s] more. Buying undervalued oil shares
[379.36s] seems like a good bet. Hasn&#39;t been this
[381.84s] low since 2000. We got a new serer we&#39;re
[386.319s] taking a serious look at. And um maybe
[390.08s] some EMPS. We do want to get some more.
[392.24s] Comp stock&#39;s gone up a lot. It&#39;s resting
[394.479s] a little bit. It hasn&#39;t come back enough
[396.16s] though to put new money to work, but
[398.639s] we&#39;re holding everything we got and
[400.24s] happy as a clam.
[403.68s] uh S&amp;P 500 price and earnings.
[408.4s] So earnings have lagged price
[412.08s] according to this, but that&#39;s what bull
[413.919s] markets look like. Equities typically
[416.72s] rise when Fed resumes cutting.
[419.759s] So uh you&#39;re starting to get rumblings
[422.0s] about shadow Fed, which would make
[424.08s] Powell lame duck. I think we&#39;re going to
[427.12s] see it. I think we could be surprised in
[431.039s] July if the CPI numbers warrant it.
[434.479s] Particularly when you&#39;re seeing all the
[435.599s] articles coming out saying the jobs
[438.0s] report was weaker than it looked, which
[440.0s] is what we said right away. Buying the
[442.96s] dip has been a winning strategy this
[444.72s] year. No
[447.84s] s Sherlock global equity performance and
[452.0s] the US dollar.
[454.319s] Global equities outperform when what?
[456.319s] when the dollar declines. That has been
[458.4s] the case. Very unpopular last year
[461.44s] except for you guys who listened in and
[463.599s] took advantage and and uh and benefited
[467.039s] from weaker dollar, stronger
[468.72s] international equities. Annualized
[471.599s] tariff revenues uh collected through
[473.919s] that&#39;s the same chart, but annualized
[475.919s] it&#39;s come comes out to $360
[478.8s] billion.
[480.479s] That&#39;s pretty serious.
[482.56s] Um,
[484.639s] and then those gold cards,
[487.52s] that&#39;s supposed to be some serious
[488.96s] amount of money, like $700 billion if
[491.52s] that&#39;s true.
[493.68s] So, we&#39;ll see. High yield, you know,
[496.0s] that you pay for play, get your
[498.319s] citizenship here. Um, high yield, never
[502.72s] really priced in a recession. We had
[505.28s] focused on that a little bit in some of
[506.879s] our data when everyone was afraid.
[508.72s] staying private for longer. A lot of
[510.56s] companies, what does that do? It creates
[512.959s] less supply of public securities, which
[515.68s] means the same amount of money. Chasing
[518.08s] fewer goods means prices go up. That&#39;s
[520.8s] why the indices are going up in addition
[523.279s] to global liquidity. Number of days
[525.519s] between all-time highs, 913 days since
[528.88s] last all-time high for the Russell 2000.
[532.24s] You got to go all the way back to the
[534.399s] early 2000s was which was the biggest
[536.32s] rally in the shortest amount of time in
[538.08s] small caps. That is the next rip your
[540.72s] face off rally that&#39;s already started.
[543.04s] Very excited about that. number of
[545.44s] firsttime buyers collapsing compliments
[549.04s] of Sha J uh who is sitting on his thumb
[554.64s] and um will be replaced uh actually or
[559.04s] symbolically either way soon unless he
[562.959s] does the right thing in July and has the
[567.12s] opportunity to go out like Seinfeld at
[569.6s] the top. Private sector jobs growth
[572.72s] year-over-year rolling over tax credits
[576.24s] available for new car purchases until
[578.399s] September 30th,
[584.0s] how much interest you can deduct.
[588.16s] That&#39;s going to be huge for the next
[589.68s] two. If you remember, 10,000 tax
[592.56s] deduction on interest for cars made in
[596.16s] the US. Hong Kong tops global IPO
[599.04s] rankings first half unintended
[601.04s] consequence of stupid policy. Those IPOs
[604.24s] should be happening in the US. They are
[606.959s] happening in Hong Kong instead. Make
[609.76s] Hong Kong banks great again. A big Q2
[613.279s] quarter should have bulls smiling.
[616.399s] average returns 12 uh uh four quarters
[620.48s] out after a 10% plus quarter going back
[624.16s] to 1950 is 9.3%
[628.24s] compliments of Ryan Dietrich at Carson
[631.68s] earnings are expected to remain strong
[634.16s] $300 estimates 265 holding up how you
[637.519s] doing now those might actually begin to
[639.519s] go up we&#39;re beyond the takeown period
[642.079s] we&#39;re now in the backend load period
[644.399s] sweet spot for the rest of the year
[647.36s] uh performance up 5 to 10% at the
[649.92s] midpoint of the year on average full
[651.839s] year return 13.8 8. We&#39;re at five. That
[654.88s] means another eight, which means indices
[657.6s] subdued under the surface. Firecrackers.
[660.72s] Um, it was amazing how much money has
[662.959s] come in this quarter and I thought, man,
[666.24s] I&#39;m probably going to be sitting on this
[667.92s] for a little while. Market feels a
[670.16s] little bit frothy. And then I looked
[672.16s] through and I was like, &quot;No, there&#39;s so
[674.32s] much to do right now.&quot; Because that
[675.76s] rotation under the surface, you&#39;re just
[677.6s] seeing the lagard start to get bid and
[680.0s] they&#39;re taking off and you and we want
[681.76s] to get in while we still have low
[682.959s] prices. So, it was exciting to see all
[685.6s] the continued opportunity and excited to
[687.76s] put the rest to work this this week and
[689.92s] in coming days and maybe week to two
[692.16s] weeks. Um, some stock now, some options
[695.68s] later, etc. Super excited. Qualifying
[698.64s] income for a starter home now up to
[701.12s] 101,000.
[702.959s] Time for positioning chase into small
[705.36s] caps. Flow&#39;s still negative despite
[707.76s] bounce. Uh you can&#39;t give them away once
[711.04s] it&#39;s when they&#39;re up here breaking to
[712.959s] new highs. Everyone will be chasing.
[715.279s] Same
[719.44s] uh story, different date. First half
[722.72s] 2025 total return.
[725.6s] Poland is leading Greece, Austria,
[728.88s] Spain, South Korea, Italy, Germany,
[731.279s] Mexico, Brazil, South Africa,
[734.0s] Netherlands, China, France, Switzerland,
[737.04s] Singapore, Vietnam, United Kingdom,
[739.12s] Canada, Japan, Australia, Taiwan,
[741.12s] Philippines,
[742.959s] followed by the United States.
[745.6s] Equity market
[747.6s] first half 6.2%
[750.16s] among the worst in the c in the world.
[753.12s] Uh, only worse is India, which everyone
[757.839s] couldn&#39;t get enough of. Malaysia,
[760.16s] Indonesia, Saudi Arabia, Turkey, and
[762.48s] Thailand being the worst. Maybe we got
[765.44s] to look for some stuff in Thailand.
[768.24s] Um, so there you go. Once it turns, it
[771.76s] turns hard. International outperforming
[774.0s] US. US equity underperformance tends to
[776.88s] be accompanied by dollar weakness. This
[779.92s] has been part of the theme, ladies and
[781.76s] gentlemen.
[782.959s] And what are we seeing?
[788.639s] We are seeing dollar weakness,
[792.079s] international equities outperformance,
[793.76s] policy uncertainty at all-time highs,
[795.36s] but earnings uncertainty close to 5-year
[797.2s] lows. So earnings
[801.76s] certainty is coming back now that a lot
[804.72s] of the chaos is in the rearview mirror.
[807.12s] And by the way, to Trump&#39;s credit,
[808.8s] that&#39;s the time to do it. The minute you
[810.24s] get in the door, you you throw in the
[812.56s] kitchen sink and then you um get all the
[816.639s] eat the crust first is what mom and dad
[818.639s] used to say, right? You don&#39;t like the
[820.079s] crust, eat the crust first and you get
[821.6s] to the good stuff second. Uh S&amp;P 500
[825.6s] leverage is near record lows. Wait till
[828.72s] rates come down and companies starting
[830.8s] issuing debt to buy stock and to buy
[835.519s] other companies. It&#39;s coming to a
[837.68s] theater near you. You know what else has
[839.279s] happened, ladies and gentlemen? How
[840.8s] about 2001,
[842.8s] which has been an analog for a lot of
[844.56s] the exciting things that we&#39;re talking
[846.32s] about and happening and have been
[848.32s] occurring. Dividends should contribute
[850.959s] more to total returns than during the
[853.04s] last decades. Zerp zero interest rate
[856.399s] policy. I&#39;ll tell you what companies
[858.8s] don&#39;t have big dividends. Mag seven.
[862.399s] I&#39;ll tell you what companies do. the
[865.12s] lagards that are starting to rip the
[867.76s] shorts faces off and there&#39;s still a
[871.76s] window. It&#39;s closing. There&#39;s no
[873.68s] question it&#39;s closing. So, kudos to you
[876.48s] who got in this quarter. Uh super duper
[879.68s] happy for you. It seems like there&#39;s
[882.0s] always stuff to do, but sometimes
[883.6s] they&#39;re better than others. And uh and
[885.68s] I&#39;m just seeing these things start to go
[887.279s] now. Like I was like, you know, PayPal
[889.44s] jumped up from 58 to 75 and and then I
[892.32s] was like I was looking I was like, &quot;God,
[894.24s] that&#39;s moved a lot. Do I put new money
[896.32s] to work here?&quot; And then I just zoomed
[898.24s] out. I was like, &quot;Uh, are you kidding?&quot;
[900.079s] Like, &quot;How much money can we put to
[902.16s] work?&quot; So, uh, so it wasn&#39;t a hard
[904.24s] decision. China and Vietnam export
[907.519s] values, exports to the US.
[911.36s] China exports to Vietnam have gone up
[913.279s] because of the tariffs. Vietnam exports
[915.36s] to the US have gone up.
[920.8s] And I guess this red line is China.
[924.16s] I don&#39;t know why this is not labeled
[926.0s] well, but okay. Chart of the day,
[928.399s] moderating earnings,
[931.44s] and that is
[934.959s] 5%. Okay, so this is here&#39;s the name of
[937.44s] the game. Expectations are low going
[939.04s] into earning season. They&#39;re down from
[940.399s] 9.3 to 5.0, which sets the bar low for
[943.12s] them to beat. Okay. So, my guess 8 or
[946.72s] 9%, I could be wrong, but that&#39;s kind of
[949.199s] been the theme and I think that&#39;ll be
[950.56s] the theme moving forward. We probably
[952.0s] get a early pop in earning season and
[953.92s] then people get tired. They check out,
[956.24s] they go to the Hamptons, they go play
[957.92s] Maidstone and uh Spy Glass and uh all
[961.759s] not Spy Glass. Jesus, I&#39;m a West Coast,
[963.6s] excuse me, I&#39;m a West Coast guy now. Um
[967.279s] National and uh and all the great
[969.68s] courses out there. US dollar overall
[971.839s] positioning
[974.399s] shorting the hole now ladies and
[975.839s] gentlemen maybe we get a little counter
[977.279s] trend bounce
[979.44s] US household ownership stock of stocks
[981.839s] as a percent of total assets is knocking
[984.079s] on the door that means mag 7
[986.8s] predominantly that&#39;s where they&#39;re all
[988.639s] crammed
[991.36s] Apple better get his AI game intact
[995.44s] Jeff Bezos is selling stock
[998.72s] 666 6 million of stock, which is kind of
[1003.839s] lunch money for him, but at the same
[1005.6s] time, it&#39;s not nothing. So, uh, just
[1008.56s] paying attention. But, uh, the Palanteer
[1012.48s] guys make him look like a because
[1014.16s] they&#39;re selling like their pants are on
[1015.68s] fire. At least at least B Bezos is is
[1018.399s] modest about it. You know, someone&#39;s got
[1019.92s] to pay for the gas on the yacht, but I
[1021.68s] mean, these other guys, holy cow. All
[1024.319s] right. Um, S&amp;P announced buybacks
[1027.679s] continue to go up. Household leverage
[1029.52s] percentage. Man, this couldn&#39;t be
[1031.679s] better. Look how it was before the great
[1033.36s] great financial crisis. The household
[1035.439s] balance sheet hasn&#39;t been this healthy
[1037.679s] since the 1960s and the 1950s. I mean,
[1042.0s] all that means is rates go down. Either
[1045.839s] Powell gets out or Powell wakes up and
[1048.799s] the animal spirits are back. Helocks uh
[1052.08s] going will be going out of style. your
[1054.559s] local baseball stadium will be, you
[1057.039s] know, sponsored by Rocket Mortgage and
[1059.84s] all of the Enco. Uh S&amp;P companies will
[1064.08s] be able to relever. Households will be
[1066.64s] able to relever. Credit expansion will
[1068.96s] be on boom boom boom into the early
[1071.6s] 2030s.
[1073.76s] Price changes for selective market
[1076.08s] classes
[1078.48s] year-over-year.
[1082.24s] Oh, that&#39;s from Cox Automotive. So, EVs
[1084.16s] have gone up the most in price and now
[1085.679s] their credits are getting taken away.
[1087.6s] That&#39;s going to be a tough sell, ladies
[1089.12s] and gentlemen. Welcome to the era of
[1091.6s] hybrid nation. Although, Americans, they
[1094.48s] still want their big trucks. You&#39;re
[1095.6s] never going to take them away. Now, you
[1096.88s] you get the they&#39;re going to personally
[1099.44s] deduct $10,000 in interest. You&#39;ll be
[1101.44s] selling Escalades till the cows come
[1102.88s] home and F-150s.
[1105.36s] 25 worst performing Russell 1000 stocks.
[1109.44s] Let&#39;s take a look for some
[1110.799s] opportunities, ladies and gentlemen. Is
[1112.72s] there anything here worth paying
[1114.24s] attention to?
[1116.4s] Uh yeah, you&#39;re all going to ask me
[1118.64s] about Restoration Hardware. I got to go
[1120.24s] to that restaurant and check it out.
[1121.44s] They have a restaurant at the top of the
[1122.799s] one. That&#39;s not my cup of tea. Uh new,
[1125.28s] that thing has just been dead forever.
[1127.12s] VF Corp, easy to put new money there.
[1129.76s] That was like a complete no-brainer this
[1131.919s] week. Super excited about that one. Uh
[1134.64s] Bracken&#39;s going to be completely fine.
[1136.4s] It we ran it up to 28. I&#39;m like, &quot;Oh,
[1139.28s] why didn&#39;t I sell some at 28?&quot; Because I
[1140.64s] didn&#39;t get in for 28. I got for $50,
[1142.64s] $80, $100 and Bracken&#39;s going to
[1144.48s] deliver. It&#39;s just off on the tariff BS.
[1147.12s] It will be fine. He&#39;s already told you
[1149.28s] in the last conference call. He&#39;s got it
[1151.36s] solved. Market&#39;s pricing in 150 cost.
[1154.24s] He&#39;s like, &quot;No, we&#39;re going to we&#39;re
[1155.679s] going to manage that.
[1159.2s] This is one more bite at the apple
[1162.88s] before we go.&quot; And we&#39;ve been to this
[1164.559s] movie before with other names and they
[1166.24s] just took off. So, uh, so that&#39;s that.
[1168.72s] American Airlines maybe. I don&#39;t know. I
[1171.039s] you know that&#39;s a trade that&#39;s just not
[1172.559s] a great business. Olan I love the
[1174.08s] chemical stuff. UNH maybe Lulu maybe
[1178.64s] Boston and Beer no thanks.
[1182.16s] Um all right investors are selling
[1185.12s] winners and buying losers so far in
[1187.2s] July. How you doing rotation rotation
[1189.52s] nation ladies and gentlemen? I&#39;ve been
[1191.039s] telling you here we go. Here we go. Here
[1193.2s] we go. You know it&#39;s funny. I had a lot
[1196.24s] of customers, clients call me and thank
[1199.36s] me for that call I did for clients on
[1202.08s] that Monday, April 7th. I did a
[1205.2s] 30-minute call. I said, &quot;Now&#39;s the time.
[1207.039s] Put in money if you&#39;re thinking about
[1208.4s] putting in money.&quot; And we just rocked
[1211.44s] it. And I said, you know, as amazing as
[1216.08s] we did because of that,
[1219.76s] I&#39;m looking across the portfolio and the
[1221.6s] big moves haven&#39;t even started yet. I
[1223.84s] mean, it&#39;s unbelievable.
[1226.559s] Um, one,
[1229.919s] how we&#39;ve been able to do and two, what
[1233.6s] we&#39;re going to do is my view. And, um, I
[1236.96s] couldn&#39;t be more excited, especially
[1238.24s] putting new money to work. I was just
[1239.6s] like, &quot;Wow, I can&#39;t believe there&#39;s
[1241.36s] still so much to do.&quot; Disconnect between
[1243.84s] that won&#39;t be the case uh, for long. But
[1246.559s] then there&#39;ll be like defenses of
[1248.48s] there&#39;s always something, but there&#39;s
[1250.24s] sometimes that are just easy pickings
[1252.4s] and we&#39;re still kind of there even
[1254.08s] though the wind windows closing quickly.
[1257.28s] Uh Russell 1000 Stokes
[1261.36s] stocks in the first half of 2025.
[1266.88s] We covered that disconnect between
[1274.159s] Wow, that&#39;s amazing. Yeah, they really
[1276.159s] did buy the worst stock. Fed
[1277.84s] expectations in equity markets.
[1284.96s] US cyclicals versus defensives.
[1288.4s] There are some defensives getting sold
[1290.159s] off here.
[1293.2s] Forward swap rate. I wish this went back
[1295.679s] a little farther. Okay. Risk appetite
[1298.4s] starting to pick up. Not at extreme.
[1302.4s] Again, I think there&#39;s more room here in
[1304.24s] the next few weeks, even for the general
[1306.24s] indices, which means these MAG7s trade
[1308.799s] to the top of the range.
[1311.039s] What&#39;s your sector outlook for the next
[1313.039s] 30 days? So, everyone&#39;s bullish on
[1314.96s] financials. Opinion and uh tech opinion
[1317.679s] follows trend. No one wants
[1319.12s] discretionary. No one wants the VF
[1321.36s] corpse, the Nikes, uh the goose, the
[1324.48s] geese.
[1326.24s] Uh they want they don&#39;t want energy.
[1328.08s] They don&#39;t want real estate. Even CCI I
[1330.4s] I like here. here. I like that rates
[1332.08s] kind of backed off a little bit. Um I
[1336.48s] think CCI at 100 makes a lot of sense.
[1340.88s] S&amp;P sector level bottom up target price
[1343.76s] versus closing price.
[1346.559s] Healthc care has the biggest spread
[1349.36s] between current price and target price
[1351.6s] in aggregate. There&#39;s opportunity there.
[1354.64s] Highest level of multif family
[1356.08s] completion since 1986.
[1358.88s] They&#39;re chasing the the dog is chasing
[1360.96s] the tail. They&#39;re looking at what worked
[1362.559s] yesterday, creating supply, that&#39;s going
[1364.799s] to be the glut of tomorrow, multif
[1366.32s] family is going to glut like nobody&#39;s
[1368.0s] business.
[1369.84s] And um
[1372.32s] as more supply comes on for single
[1374.799s] family, as Trump opens the 512,000
[1378.24s] acres, as the incentives from the big
[1382.0s] beautiful bill go into effect, 5,000 new
[1384.96s] home buyers,
[1386.88s] all the other advantages, rates come
[1388.88s] down
[1390.64s] in spite of Powell. Despite Powell,
[1394.24s] first half asset class returns and
[1396.32s] drawdowns. US dollar weakest opening
[1399.2s] first half. No one expected except the
[1401.44s] people, the great people of the hedge
[1404.0s] fund tips with Tom Hayes community. Um,
[1407.84s] US small caps tough time
[1412.48s] on their way to the promised land.
[1417.28s] Emerging what else? Cash did poor. Fixed
[1420.799s] income did poorly. I think that changes
[1422.72s] the second half. Commodities
[1425.2s] opportunities second half and then XUS
[1429.76s] did the best
[1432.0s] health care provided. What do we got
[1434.32s] here?
[1437.36s] Healthcare provided biggest Boost to
[1439.44s] private US payrolls. They&#39;re not hiring
[1441.36s] by accident. Ladies and gentlemen,
[1443.039s] there&#39;s there&#39;s going to be pony in the
[1444.24s] pile. We&#39;re going to talk about one of
[1445.44s] our holdings that just got a new CEO, a
[1448.0s] turnaround Tom type of jockey. very
[1450.96s] excited to don&#39;t know where the radio
[1452.48s] voice is coming from today, ladies and
[1454.159s] gentlemen. I don&#39;t know, but uh I&#39;m
[1456.64s] having some fun. S&amp;P is entering its
[1458.88s] best seasonal weeks, the next couple of
[1461.52s] weeks gaining currency. Stable coin
[1464.72s] market capitalization going through the
[1466.72s] roof. PayPal might be a surprise. Um
[1471.12s] tailwind that wasn&#39;t in our original
[1472.88s] thesis that takes it to the promised
[1474.799s] land. Sixth largest stable coin issuer,
[1478.96s] network of 435 million people around the
[1482.48s] world. Uh, could be interesting.
[1484.72s] Professional managers buy tops. They&#39;re
[1487.679s] not buying.
[1489.679s] So, we got time.
[1492.72s] US MBA mortgage applications ticking up
[1495.679s] as rates came down a little bit the last
[1497.279s] couple weeks. Percent of stocks
[1498.48s] outperforming the world index above
[1500.88s] average right now. Breath is improving.
[1503.919s] Merging market assets and gold benefit
[1506.64s] most from a weaker dollar.
[1510.0s] Change in median home price from prior
[1512.0s] year. Cape Coral metro area,
[1516.4s] Florida, negative - 255%. - 255,000.
[1524.64s] Wow.
[1527.279s] Florida is a leading indicator.
[1531.279s] Good additional note there, Jeff.
[1535.44s] Chart two.
[1537.6s] Fed paralyzed by Trumpian uncertainty.
[1545.76s] That&#39;s one way to put it.
[1548.32s] Onto the articles. Hong Kong listings
[1551.279s] pipeline hits record high as equity
[1553.2s] market booms.
[1555.039s] All those fees should have been US
[1556.88s] banks. Instead, we gave it to China
[1561.84s] or Hong Kong.
[1564.0s] Calls grow for China&#39;s household sector
[1566.0s] to be bigger economic driver.
[1570.559s] That&#39;s going to benefit Baba. China June
[1573.36s] car sales hit record for the month on
[1575.679s] subsidy boost.
[1578.08s] It&#39;s funny.
[1583.039s] Western investors get so nervous when
[1585.12s] the government do does negative things,
[1588.08s] but when they do positive things, they
[1590.72s] don&#39;t believe they&#39;re going to work. You
[1592.799s] can&#39;t make this stuff up. But that&#39;s
[1595.039s] fine. Gave us more opportunity. By the
[1596.559s] way, first time in a long time that
[1599.6s] we&#39;ve been able to put new money to work
[1601.919s] in Alibaba, which is super exciting. I I
[1604.96s] never thought it was going to get to a
[1606.159s] point where I&#39;d want to put new money
[1607.6s] again. Uh just ride it to the promised
[1610.64s] land. It gave us another bite at the
[1612.48s] apple. You know, I was talking with a a
[1614.72s] just a great client of mine, by the way.
[1617.2s] And um
[1619.679s] you know I said to him I said look
[1621.6s] there&#39;s no invisible force but I got to
[1623.36s] say like if I was running the world this
[1626.08s] is exactly what I would have the chart
[1627.679s] do to to just screw all the people who
[1630.08s] wouldn&#39;t buy it at 60 bought it at 148
[1632.88s] just completely destroy them until the
[1635.36s] next move straight to 200. And that&#39;s
[1637.52s] exactly what&#39;s happened. He&#39;s like he&#39;s
[1639.039s] like I agree with you on both counts.
[1641.12s] You know number one there&#39;s no invisible
[1643.12s] hand. Number two it&#39;s acting exactly the
[1645.52s] way it should. and he&#39;s a super smart
[1647.36s] guy. Finance background, business
[1649.279s] builder background.
[1651.2s] Uh Bessanims to meet with Chinese
[1653.279s] official in the next few weeks, probably
[1655.2s] next catalyst. JP Morgan says China&#39;s
[1657.919s] crackdown on overcapacity may boost
[1660.08s] stocks. You think stock picker shine
[1663.12s] sniffing out value during market tumult
[1665.919s] value investing was out of favor? Uh but
[1668.64s] 63% of active ina man managers investing
[1671.919s] in cheap large cap stocks outperformed
[1674.48s] their benchmarks.
[1677.679s] No question about it. Value managers
[1680.24s] found opportunities from industrial
[1681.919s] firms which rallied 11%.
[1684.32s] uh avoided bond proxies like staples
[1688.32s] strengthen industrials and expectation
[1690.159s] interest rate cuts led some market
[1691.6s] watchers to anticipate broader strength
[1693.279s] from the value sector with value stocks
[1695.919s] outperforming each of the 12 style
[1698.64s] factors tracked by Bloomberg.
[1701.6s] Unloved stocks rally is luring some big
[1703.84s] buyers off the sidelines. Unloved
[1707.2s] stocks, baby, that&#39;s what we love.
[1710.159s] Russell rips shorts torched as lagard
[1713.84s] goes leader.
[1716.64s] I love a headline like that. Small cap
[1719.12s] stocks get a big beautiful boost. That&#39;s
[1722.0s] from Jacob Son and Shine over at Barons.
[1725.2s] Great article. Goldman lowers Treasury
[1727.679s] yield forecast on rising Fed cut bet.
[1730.399s] How you doing? June jobs report was not
[1734.64s] strong.
[1736.88s] And you can see some data here and some
[1739.279s] commentary. Cautionary signals emerge in
[1742.48s] latest jobs report. That&#39;s from
[1745.12s] Bloomberg.
[1747.039s] Point is, it&#39;s time to set the table for
[1750.159s] Powell to save face and do the right
[1752.96s] thing. That&#39;s half the battle. He can&#39;t
[1756.08s] save face now because Trump
[1759.679s] is uh he doesn&#39;t want to be bullied.
[1762.96s] So,
[1766.559s] they&#39;ll figure out a way. Home buyers
[1768.399s] finally responded after mortgage rate
[1770.0s] hit lowest levels in three months.
[1772.96s] Firsttime home buyers are MIA. Landlords
[1775.279s] are the winners until they&#39;re not.
[1778.96s] Housing market deals emerge as builder
[1781.52s] inventory hits 2009 levels. Number of
[1784.799s] unsold.
[1786.88s] completed new single family homes in May
[1789.12s] 25, hit the highest level since summer
[1792.32s] 2009, spurring bigger builder incentives
[1795.279s] and deals. This is the car story all
[1797.279s] over again, a year behind. Cars are
[1799.44s] going to go bananas as rates come down.
[1801.6s] Housing is going to go bananas. And if
[1803.2s] you don&#39;t have exposure, you&#39;re just not
[1805.36s] going to get incredible performance. You
[1806.96s] can go chase Nvidia at the highs. You
[1809.76s] can go chase Palunteer while they&#39;re
[1811.36s] dumping stock in your lap. Uh, or you
[1814.08s] can go where the puck is going, not what
[1816.559s] worked in the rear view mirror. How to
[1818.88s] save thousands on a car by stacking
[1821.039s] Trump&#39;s tax credits with Biden&#39;s
[1824.399s] uh, I didn&#39;t know Biden had a tax
[1826.399s] credit. Oh, for EVs. Okay, so you can
[1828.64s] buy an EV even though they&#39;re up 12%
[1830.88s] year-on-year. Get a 7500 EV tax credit
[1833.84s] and 10,000 interest on loans. So, there
[1836.64s] you go. From now through September, one
[1839.2s] last hurrah for the EV land. EU US trade
[1843.279s] talk focus on tariff offset for auto
[1846.08s] makers.
[1849.2s] See how that goes. Boeing. Yeah, he&#39;s
[1851.44s] gonna say, I tell you what, I&#39;ll do
[1852.96s] zero. Just make them all in the US. Uh,
[1856.08s] Boeing delivers most airplanes since
[1858.48s] late 2023 after ramping up 737 max
[1861.52s] output. The game is on, ladies and
[1863.279s] gentlemen. You were there for the turn.
[1865.44s] You hung in there from 150 down to 135.
[1869.52s] Most of you bought a lot more at 135.
[1872.159s] Now we&#39;re at 230, headed to 300. Retail
[1875.52s] buying and participation blow away all
[1878.32s] records in the first half 2025. And you
[1880.32s] know what? They&#39;ve been damn right since
[1882.72s] co.
[1885.279s] Here we go. Backter International, the
[1888.48s] sleepy do nothing giant for the last
[1891.44s] year, names ATS Andrew Hitter as next
[1896.559s] CEO. Medical products maker says Hitter
[1899.2s] will assume his responsibilities no
[1901.12s] later than September 3rd.
[1904.159s] Your last few days at the beach for the
[1906.32s] next five years, Mr. Hitter, you got
[1908.48s] some work to do, but we know you can do
[1910.48s] it. How do we know? Because you did it
[1912.72s] at ATS in 2017 when the stock was at 57
[1917.84s] bucks and by 2024, just seven years
[1921.279s] later, you took it to close to 50 bucks.
[1924.32s] So, seven bagger in
[1928.159s] seven years. Seven bagger in seven
[1931.039s] years. Ladies and gentlemen, this is
[1932.64s] this guy&#39;s a winner. Now, we got him at
[1935.12s] the at the helm of sleepy backter in the
[1939.919s] healthc care which is Left for Dead
[1942.159s] which is now going to start to rock a
[1944.72s] turnaround Tom style. Trump&#39;s energy
[1948.399s] department warns American could face 800
[1951.039s] hours of blackouts by 2030. Not if they
[1953.76s] have a Generrack generator, ladies and
[1955.919s] gentlemen. That&#39;s one that&#39;s run away
[1957.44s] that I can&#39;t put new money to work. It&#39;s
[1959.679s] up 30 something points in a short period
[1961.84s] of time. Uh but we&#39;ll see. It&#39;s It&#39;s
[1965.679s] tempting me. It&#39;s sitting there smiling
[1968.559s] and saying, &quot;Come on, buy me. You know,
[1970.559s] I&#39;m going to 200, baby.&quot; And I&#39;m saying,
[1972.64s] &quot;Yeah, I know, but like you you you
[1975.12s] know, you got to calm down. You&#39;ve had a
[1976.799s] good run here in the last couple of
[1978.24s] months. Plenty of gas left in the tank.
[1980.72s] Stock market and sentiment results
[1983.84s] article of the week. Comto stock
[1986.08s] resources update. Each week we try to
[1987.679s] cover one to two companies we&#39;ve
[1988.88s] discussed in previous podcast video cast
[1991.2s] for our own clients, including
[1992.72s] personally I eat my own cooking. Ladies
[1994.799s] and gentlemen,
[1997.12s] in late 2023, we came out publicly with
[2000.159s] a new position in Comtock Resources, a
[2002.88s] name that had been left for dead and one
[2005.2s] you practically couldn&#39;t give away. A
[2006.96s] combination of record domestic natural
[2008.88s] gas
[2010.799s] We actually
[2015.039s] we actually went in earlier than that,
[2017.44s] Jeff. I know there&#39;s no articles on the
[2019.679s] site, but we went in on the podcast.
[2021.36s] Anyway, the point is your price is
[2023.12s] correct because we we wrote it up, if
[2026.24s] I&#39;m not mistaken, we wrote it up to 20
[2029.279s] and then it came back down. We we loaded
[2031.76s] a lot more and our basis is now high
[2034.72s] eights, low nines
[2036.88s] across the board. Then it ran up to 31.
[2038.72s] Now it&#39;s breathing for a little bit.
[2041.919s] Um,
[2043.84s] combination of record domestic natural
[2045.6s] production, flooding inventories, milder
[2048.079s] weather, lowering demand, and being
[2050.32s] blindsided by policies slowing LNG
[2053.2s] export projects crushed the stock and
[2055.44s] sent natural gas prices to their lowest
[2057.2s] inflation adjusted levels since they
[2058.72s] began trading on the NY in 1990.
[2061.919s] We saw this as an opportunity and
[2063.52s] started adding around $8 a share basis.
[2065.679s] That&#39;s correct. getting our hands on as
[2067.919s] many shares as we could as the stock
[2069.44s] drifted lower into the $7 range. That&#39;s
[2072.879s] correct. And two things stood out to us
[2075.04s] that made Comtock a no-brainer. First,
[2077.919s] we were investing Perry Pu with Jerry
[2079.76s] Jones. While he&#39;s best known as the
[2081.76s] owner of the Dallas Cowboys, if you
[2083.599s] realize he built his initial fortune in
[2085.52s] the oil and gas business and now
[2087.52s] controls 71% of the entire company, his
[2090.399s] track record speaks for itself. And in
[2092.0s] public interviews, he&#39;s openly stated
[2093.359s] that his oil and gas interests are worth
[2095.919s] well more than the Dallas Cowboys, aka
[2098.64s] the most valuable uh sports team in the
[2101.52s] whole world at nearly 11 billion. We
[2104.8s] agree. Second, Comtock is the lowest
[2107.04s] cost producer with a cost structure
[2108.48s] that&#39;s 48% lower than pure averages. We
[2111.92s] believe in the long-term natural gas
[2113.92s] theme, and Comtock is undoubtedly the
[2116.4s] most efficiently run pure play in the
[2118.32s] space. In other words, they perform
[2120.48s] peers when prices are in the doldrums
[2122.32s] and when the cycle inevitably turns,
[2124.64s] they have the greatest operating
[2126.0s] leverage. The best part, and something
[2128.0s] that wasn&#39;t even baked into our original
[2129.599s] investment thesis, is that while prices
[2131.52s] were in the gutter and much of the
[2132.88s] industry was hiding under their desks in
[2134.48s] the fetal position, Comtock was quietly
[2136.96s] playing offense looking for the next big
[2138.56s] drilling opportunity. management spent
[2140.16s] the last 5 years studying geologic data
[2142.72s] and signing over 20,000 new drilling
[2145.04s] leases across a massive 520,000 netacre
[2148.72s] footprint in the western Hannesville
[2150.88s] region.
[2153.44s] This region is still virtually
[2154.72s] undeveloped with management calling it
[2156.64s] the holy grail because they expect it to
[2158.88s] yield significantly more resource
[2160.56s] potential per section than their legacy
[2162.56s] Hannesville assets with potential for
[2164.72s] thousands of future drilling locations.
[2167.2s] For context, legacy Hanesville region
[2170.079s] has 1300 net locations and 94 net
[2172.88s] producing wells across 302,000 acres.
[2175.839s] Western Hesville covers 520,000 net
[2178.4s] acres, but currently only has 19
[2180.96s] producing wells. By all means, this is
[2183.359s] very early days. Meanwhile, it&#39;s
[2187.44s] perfectly situated about
[2190.079s] Isn&#39;t it exciting to take a stock that
[2192.72s] had a three and a half four bagger and
[2194.96s] it&#39;s very early days? Meanwhile, it&#39;s
[2198.0s] perfectly situated about 100 miles from
[2200.64s] both Houston and Dallas prime locations
[2202.8s] for future data centers that management
[2204.88s] is already in discussions for. This is
[2207.2s] on top of its proximity to the Gulf of
[2210.64s] America, which is home to more than
[2213.599s] hundred billion dollar in LG terminals
[2216.72s] and continues to rapidly expand. With LG
[2220.48s] capacity growing and AI and data centers
[2222.24s] driving electricity demand to record
[2223.76s] levels, the real question over the next
[2225.52s] few years will be where will all the
[2228.0s] natural gas come from? Comtock will
[2230.8s] happily be there to answer just that.
[2234.72s] Chat GPT queries are six to 10 times as
[2238.24s] power intensive as traditional Google
[2240.96s] searches. US electricity consumption
[2244.079s] from the EIA 1990 to 2026
[2249.839s] is up close to 60%.
[2253.68s] US Henry Hub natural gas spot price
[2256.32s] going up. Oh, and by the way, this is
[2258.4s] all happening while managers are still
[2260.079s] sitting near record low allocation to
[2262.24s] the energy sector. This move will be
[2264.24s] hated on the way up and chased when it&#39;s
[2266.16s] too late. We will be smiling so wide we
[2268.64s] could eat a banana sideways.
[2272.32s] Global energy. Here&#39;s institutional
[2274.88s] quote unquote smart money positioning.
[2277.359s] Going to miss the boat again. One
[2279.839s] standard deviation below its long-term
[2281.68s] average.
[2283.44s] And here are some uh highlights from the
[2285.92s] earnings.
[2288.16s] Operating cash flow was 239 million. all
[2291.28s] the numbers, all the metrics going up.
[2294.16s] You can go to hedge funips.com.
[2298.0s] While you&#39;re there, click on terms. This
[2299.92s] is all opinion, not advice. Money
[2302.64s] management, we&#39;re closing today. So, if
[2304.8s] you didn&#39;t get in today, um,
[2308.64s] at least put your name in today. Uh, you
[2310.56s] got to wait till next quarter. If you&#39;re
[2312.16s] the small accounts of a million to five
[2314.88s] million, if you&#39;re the normal accounts
[2316.8s] of five or 10 million or more, you can
[2320.0s] come in whenever you damn please. We&#39;ll
[2322.8s] pick up the phone and you can just say,
[2326.079s] &quot;I just called to say I love you and we
[2328.56s] will happily uh uh accommodate you at
[2333.119s] your convenience.&quot;
[2337.2s] Moving along
[2339.92s] here, you can see the free cash flow
[2341.839s] gains year onear, the net net income
[2344.32s] gains, the oil and gas sales, Ebidax,
[2349.2s] etc.
[2351.28s] Natural gas price realizations going up,
[2355.839s] great liquidity through 2029, 2030. Good
[2359.28s] balance sheet, huge opportunity.
[2362.64s] Uh in Western Hannesville drilling
[2366.16s] results, laterals going wider and wider,
[2369.44s] more output for less cost, lowest cost
[2372.24s] producer by a mile. Look at this.
[2376.24s] They&#39;re there eight competitors. The
[2379.599s] nearest one, they&#39;re at 83 cents. Their
[2381.839s] nearest one is at 95% 95 cents. And the
[2385.52s] worst, the eighth one is at 272.
[2388.8s] Best-in-class cost structure of gas
[2391.119s] producers.
[2392.72s] PV10 value worth 5.7 billion. It&#39;s
[2396.88s] nothing compared to the unproved
[2398.96s] reserves that we&#39;re talking about here,
[2401.359s] which is probably another 10 to 20 years
[2404.16s] of um untapped or unrecorded assets
[2411.839s] can go through the conference call
[2415.119s] and I would suggest you do.
[2418.24s] It&#39;s funny, someone said to me, well,
[2419.76s] you can now you can just summarize all
[2421.28s] of them with chat GPT. I said, great. I
[2422.88s] hope you do that because you&#39;re never
[2424.8s] going to get the nuance and really
[2426.079s] understand and you&#39;re never you&#39;re going
[2427.68s] to lose all the edge. So summarize away
[2431.68s] and we will do the work. Alibaba update.
[2435.52s] A few weeks ago, Alibaba released its
[2437.2s] annual letter to shareholders despite
[2438.8s] the price action which we welcomed as it
[2441.68s] gave us a chance to put new money to
[2442.88s] work for the first time in a while. The
[2444.16s] biggest takeaway is that the business
[2445.599s] continues to fire on all cylinders.
[2447.359s] Nothing we didn&#39;t already know, but here
[2449.52s] are a few highlights worth noting.
[2451.359s] International commerce remains on track
[2453.839s] to achieve its first profitable quarter
[2455.52s] in the coming fiscal year. Other profit
[2457.599s] previously loss-making businesses are
[2459.28s] now on track to reach profitability.
[2461.04s] Revenue from AI related products post
[2463.44s] posted tripledigit growth for seven
[2467.119s] consecutive quarters. This is the
[2469.119s] cheapest best AI play in the world. I&#39;ll
[2473.76s] repeat it. Revenue from AI related
[2475.92s] products posted tripledigit growth for
[2478.24s] seven consecutive quarters, helping
[2480.16s] drive overall cloud revenue back into
[2482.319s] doubledigit growth. Number one cloud
[2484.56s] player, number one retailer to the
[2486.56s] middle class. International growth
[2489.52s] booming. Management repurchased 11.9
[2492.48s] billion worth of shares during the year,
[2494.16s] reducing the share count by 5.1%. That
[2496.64s] was on top of 4 billion in dividends and
[2498.48s] special dividends paid during the year
[2499.92s] with another 4.6 billion in dividends
[2502.16s] already announced for the current year.
[2503.359s] Alibaba reigns the number one e-commerce
[2505.76s] platform in China with total e-commerce
[2507.839s] now making up nearly 27% of retail
[2510.16s] consumption and reaching over 1.1
[2511.839s] billion internet users. Management is
[2514.56s] doubling down on instant commerce
[2516.24s] offering nearly 7 billion in coupons
[2518.64s] over the next year to gain share. Daily
[2521.52s] orders have already reached 80 million
[2523.68s] and twice daily active users have passed
[2527.2s] 200 million greater around 40% of market
[2531.119s] share in just three months.
[2538.72s] Sentiment is getting a little bit too
[2540.319s] greedy. So maybe we get a little pause
[2542.4s] in the rally. And congrats to everyone
[2545.2s] who came in this quarter. Very excited
[2547.119s] for you. Very grateful to have you on
[2549.359s] board. Defense and Aerospace earnings
[2551.839s] estimates, revisions, top 30 weights,
[2554.24s] revisions in the last 60 days for this
[2556.56s] year up 86 bips. Next year up 90 pips,
[2560.96s] almost 1%.
[2563.44s] Energy
[2565.04s] down
[2568.079s] up down ratio. Oh, sorry. Uh down 1.68%
[2573.2s] and 2026 down 2.09%.
[2579.28s] Let&#39;s take a look at some economic data.
[2585.359s] Small business optimism still pretty
[2587.52s] high, little less than expectations.
[2590.16s] Consumer credit is low lower that you we
[2593.76s] got to bring those rates down to get
[2595.04s] some credit expansion to make this thing
[2596.64s] hum. Welcome to capitalism.
[2600.96s] And we got initial and continuing
[2604.48s] tomorrow. And then we got some inflation
[2607.28s] I believe next week which is going to be
[2609.359s] the key
[2611.119s] numbers.
[2614.56s] C CPI on Tuesday
[2619.119s] that&#39;ll be right before I go on Vney.
[2623.52s] PPI on Wednesday.
[2628.48s] Retail sales on Thursday. Busy week.
[2632.4s] We talked about earnings expectations.
[2634.319s] So we got that. Let&#39;s move on to ask me
[2637.28s] anything questions. We got quite a few
[2639.04s] great ones this week. Let&#39;s uh hear from
[2643.119s] the first person who first name is
[2646.319s] common, last name is sense. Haha.
[2651.2s] Um last 30 days PDD is up 3% while Baba
[2654.8s] is down 15%. Is there something to be
[2657.44s] concerned about? uh your investment
[2660.56s] framework is to be concerned about. Um
[2665.359s] you&#39;re focused on price versus value and
[2668.16s] uh and that&#39;s how you wind up getting
[2670.4s] flushed out of great stocks and tempted
[2673.359s] by mediocre stocks. So beware. Um
[2677.599s] question, what do you say about Arrow
[2679.68s] Electronics?
[2681.28s] I&#39;m guessing this is not going to be
[2682.8s] something that fits in our framework,
[2684.16s] but let me be open-minded. I&#39;m uh this
[2686.8s] is likely a new listener.
[2690.64s] So, welcome to the podcast. Yeah, this
[2693.119s] is this is something that&#39;s already
[2695.119s] double off the lows and now wants me to
[2697.359s] look at it. So, first off, I&#39;d like to
[2700.16s] welcome you to Hedge Fund Tips with Tom
[2702.48s] Hayes. Uh you&#39;re going to learn a lot. I
[2705.76s] hope you&#39;ll tune in every week and um
[2708.72s] and you&#39;ll learn a different framework
[2710.16s] and and you&#39;ll see whether you&#39;re
[2711.68s] genetically made up to invest in this
[2714.24s] way or if you want to follow a different
[2716.24s] strategy. There are plenty of ways to
[2717.839s] make money. Uh but we do the one that
[2720.24s] works consistently for us and for our
[2722.0s] clients
[2724.24s] and we don&#39;t chase things that have
[2726.0s] already run.
[2728.64s] But I&#39;ll tell you what I think
[2730.4s] generically
[2732.24s] from a trading and positioning
[2733.44s] standpoint. I would never buy it here
[2734.96s] from in general. No, I mean revenues are
[2737.119s] falling off a cliff here. Uh, and price
[2740.24s] is near all-time highs. So, right, I I
[2743.359s] I&#39;m not going to spend a lot of time on
[2744.56s] this one. I&#39;m just going to pass.
[2747.04s] It&#39;s probably an okay business, but it&#39;s
[2749.359s] priced in what it&#39;s already doing. FBI,
[2753.119s] great question, by the way. I hope you
[2754.4s] have more in the future. FBI,
[2758.96s] Fortune Brands. This is interesting.
[2772.8s] Okay.
[2775.52s] So, price just followed cash flow. Let
[2778.4s] me do something else here.
[2782.24s] FBI N.
[2790.16s] Okay. So cash flow collapsed for a
[2792.24s] little while.
[2794.56s] Revenues have been flat to down for a
[2797.359s] while.
[2799.04s] Margins are starting to tick up.
[2808.02s] [Music]
[2810.16s] Home and security products for
[2812.64s] residential home repair, remodeling,
[2815.2s] security applications,
[2817.28s] water, outdoor security,
[2819.839s] faucets, accessories, kitchen, sinks,
[2821.76s] waste supply. So, it&#39;s a housing play.
[2824.319s] Decking
[2826.319s] I I think this is
[2829.44s] probably okay. Let&#39;s see. Master
[2832.16s] lockdeatic doors.
[2835.359s] Yeah, I kind of like this. probably down
[2837.52s] on the tariff nonsense, but the demand
[2840.24s] is going to be so big.
[2846.96s] I don&#39;t know if the upside&#39;s big enough
[2848.56s] for me to get attracted, but this
[2849.839s] thing&#39;s going to trade up. This is
[2851.52s] definitely going to trade up. And I
[2853.04s] think that you have done a good job, Mr.
[2857.44s] John Garvey,
[2861.28s] Lee Foster,
[2867.28s] what do you think about valet
[2869.52s] stepping uh stepping on Albamaro&#39;s toes
[2871.599s] in the material space which I have a
[2873.04s] position by the way? Albamar is starting
[2875.839s] to rock, isn&#39;t it?
[2880.16s] [Music]
[2884.24s] 70 bucks up from 50. We&#39;re on our way.
[2887.119s] And so you look at these things, it&#39;s
[2888.64s] like, God, it&#39;s moved 20 bucks. But then
[2891.119s] you zoom out and you&#39;re like, yeah, and
[2894.24s] it&#39;s just getting started, homeboy.
[2895.68s] Like, all right. So, you got to buy it
[2896.96s] up 10 bucks. So, so what?
[2900.0s] Uh, what do you think about valet? Do
[2901.839s] you think iron ore is close to
[2903.76s] bottoming? Good chance of a double from
[2906.079s] here. I&#39;ve never liked valet.
[2922.8s] I don&#39;t like Valet. I don&#39;t like Tinto.
[2925.28s] I do like Albamar though. Uh let&#39;s just
[2928.88s] see.
[2937.28s] Yeah, I I just don&#39;t like it. I don&#39;t
[2939.359s] like it. I have and when I answer
[2942.48s] quickly, it&#39;s not like because I&#39;m not
[2943.68s] doing like I&#39;ve I&#39;ve I&#39;ve studied the
[2946.079s] business many times over the last 20
[2947.92s] years. So like I I just don&#39;t like the
[2950.0s] business. Phil Truck,
[2955.52s] hey Tom, 26 years old, been a listener
[2958.16s] over a year now. All right. Awesome.
[2960.319s] Phil, you have truly you truly have been
[2964.64s] life-changing with your opinion, not
[2966.16s] advice. Thank you. Thank you for all you
[2967.68s] do. uh what I gathered star was about
[2970.48s] 62.2 2 million that&#39;s annualized first
[2973.44s] half 2025 if we get something equal to
[2976.24s] or greater for second half we didn&#39;t
[2977.92s] apply $4 base case
[2984.16s] uh it could be in that neighborhood I
[2987.119s] think at some point you know $35
[2991.68s] a share we&#39;re already starting to price
[2993.839s] in $3 of earnings we&#39;re not there yet
[2997.92s] um
[2999.839s] so Look, they&#39;re doing everything that
[3002.88s] they can control. All we got to do is
[3004.88s] focus on
[3007.92s] the volumes. And if the volumes come
[3010.96s] from getting Powell under control,
[3014.24s] Bessant doing what he&#39;s going to do with
[3015.68s] the 10-year
[3018.0s] and the big beautiful bill tax deduction
[3021.599s] for interest payments on US cars. I
[3023.359s] think it&#39;s going to boom. I mean, and I
[3025.119s] think when it turns, it&#39;s not going to
[3026.4s] be like two, three, four over the next
[3029.04s] three years. I think it&#39;s going to be
[3030.4s] like 3 and a half
[3032.88s] 610
[3034.96s] dollars a share in earnings and
[3036.4s] everyone&#39;s what the hell happened and on
[3038.48s] the catchup the multiple expand from
[3041.119s] eight times to 15 or 20 times
[3045.92s] and we&#39;ll make a lot more money than
[3047.2s] we&#39;ve even already made. So uh so that&#39;s
[3049.92s] that good question.
[3056.16s] Griffin Brown,
[3058.88s] what are your thoughts on the
[3059.76s] possibility of AI taking over
[3061.119s] entry-level analyst and research roles?
[3064.24s] Should young aspiring analysts be
[3065.68s] deterred from the field because of this,
[3067.76s] or do you think it&#39;s just noise?
[3071.68s] Uh, you know, I tell most kids or young
[3074.88s] people, go build a business in your 20s
[3078.24s] and you&#39;ll either get rich or you&#39;ll
[3079.76s] fail in your 20s, in which case you can
[3081.359s] always go get a job. Uh, if you really
[3084.4s] love it and you think you&#39;re smarter
[3085.76s] than the average bear, I would do it
[3087.92s] because if you&#39;re exceptional, you&#39;ll do
[3089.68s] fine regardless.
[3091.92s] Um,
[3094.48s] I do think it&#39;s going to have an impact
[3096.079s] on on that aspect of the business. Uh,
[3098.4s] it&#39;s going to be way more competitive.
[3100.0s] You&#39;re going to have to be better, but
[3101.119s] the ones who are really good will never
[3102.88s] have any competition. Robots are not.
[3105.599s] Uh, because there&#39;s some intangibles
[3107.28s] that the robots can&#39;t replicate. But the
[3109.76s] problem is is it takes many years to
[3111.2s] build those intangibles. So I would say
[3114.4s] follow your passion at the very least
[3116.16s] you&#39;re going to learn the language of
[3118.0s] business which is accounting and
[3120.64s] understanding financials and if the
[3123.28s] industry gets tougher and you can&#39;t meet
[3125.28s] your goals doing what you thought you
[3127.28s] wanted to do you&#39;ll have a great
[3128.64s] financial background to do anything you
[3130.24s] want to do. So um
[3133.839s] follow your passion. If you&#39;re
[3134.96s] exclusively going in because you think
[3136.4s] that&#39;s the way you can make the most
[3137.599s] amount of money in the shortest period
[3138.72s] of time. I think you have a better
[3140.319s] chance of getting rich in your 20s and
[3141.839s] 30s building a business. Uh but if you
[3144.48s] grind it out by your 40s, you can make
[3146.48s] more money than you know you could ever
[3148.72s] possibly imagine because you&#39;ll be that
[3150.88s] good that you will
[3154.48s] be generating the value in the
[3156.079s] marketplace that warrants making
[3158.24s] exceptional amounts of money. And in
[3159.92s] your 20s and 30s, it&#39;s very low
[3161.68s] probability.
[3163.28s] So, if you&#39;re taking the long view
[3164.64s] because you love it and you&#39;re willing
[3165.839s] to eat dirt for 10 years, then have at
[3168.64s] it. Uh, and you should do it. But if
[3172.4s] it&#39;s like, I just want to get rich and
[3173.92s] drive a nice car, like build a business.
[3176.64s] David T, can you take a look at WFRD?
[3180.96s] Possibly better than SLB
[3183.359s] as far as turnaround is concerned.
[3188.079s] WFR
[3190.079s] D.
[3192.16s] Oh, the old Weatherford.
[3200.8s] I forgot why I hate this business, but
[3203.359s] let&#39;s take a look at it. Maybe it was a
[3205.28s] bankruptcy reorg.
[3207.68s] WFRD?
[3211.76s] Yeah, looks like it was a bankruptcy
[3213.359s] reorg.
[3214.96s] Maybe they&#39;ll get it right this time.
[3216.559s] But there&#39;s probably some of the same
[3217.76s] actors involved.
[3221.119s] I would check that out. I
[3225.2s] n
[3228.559s] don&#39;t take the second prettiest girl in
[3230.24s] the in the ugliest industry. Take the
[3231.92s] prettiest girl to the prom.
[3235.359s] Eric F.
[3238.559s] Dear Mr. Hayes, I&#39;ve listened to the
[3239.839s] podcast for about four months. I really
[3242.24s] admire your persistent optimistic
[3243.68s] outlook on opportunities in the market.
[3245.2s] Does your optimism extend from a
[3246.559s] viewpoint there&#39;s always a turnaround
[3247.92s] opportunity somewhere or are there times
[3250.4s] during your career when you&#39;re not so
[3251.68s] optimistic and perhaps neutral or even
[3253.2s] bearish? Many times I&#39;ve been super
[3255.2s] bearish
[3256.72s] um and um when it was justified and the
[3260.48s] right time to to be so. It hasn&#39;t been
[3262.72s] and it&#39;s not going to be more likely for
[3264.559s] for some time. Yeah, you&#39;re going to get
[3265.92s] some chop in the fall. Suck it up,
[3267.44s] buttercup, but we&#39;re going to resolve
[3269.2s] higher before the end of the year.
[3270.96s] Unfortunately, there are not enough
[3272.48s] hours in the day to review all your past
[3274.079s] episodes to understand how your outlook
[3276.4s] has changed through the years in
[3277.68s] different market environments.
[3279.92s] Thanks, ARGF. So, I hope I answered your
[3281.76s] question. Um,
[3287.28s] there are not enough hours in a day. So,
[3289.04s] there are 168 hours in a week. I&#39;ve done
[3291.839s] 299 episodes. So, it would take you four
[3295.119s] weeks
[3296.72s] to learn
[3299.68s] 40% of what I&#39;ve learned in 20 years if
[3302.72s] you wanted to make it a career. But, um,
[3306.64s] don&#39;t do that. It&#39;s too hard.
[3309.839s] Matthew Gy on the podcast, you can speak
[3312.88s] your thoughts on investing the S&amp;P right
[3314.72s] now given very high valuations.
[3318.64s] All right. Your numbers are wrong, but
[3320.16s] your thesis is correct.
[3322.72s] Do you think it&#39;s time to sell? I don&#39;t
[3324.72s] know. I mean, when you&#39;re asking me
[3326.0s] about the S&amp;P 500, you&#39;re asking me
[3327.599s] about MAG 7. I don&#39;t have a view. We&#39;re
[3329.52s] not correlated to the S&amp;P. Yes, if the
[3332.079s] market goes down a lot, our our names
[3333.68s] will be hit. But if the market grinds
[3336.319s] sideway, we&#39;re going to we&#39;re going to
[3337.52s] make a killing. So, I that&#39;s kind of my
[3340.559s] base case. Sideways, maybe five to 10%
[3343.52s] pullbacks in the fall. Uh but being in
[3346.319s] the right names, it&#39;s not not even going
[3347.839s] to matter. I don&#39;t I don&#39;t even think
[3349.2s] about the indices. That&#39;s like that&#39;s
[3350.88s] the farthest thing from my mind. I just
[3352.72s] look at on a business by business basis.
[3355.119s] If JP Morgan was going to underwrite me
[3358.0s] buying 100% of the business, the only
[3360.96s] catch was I had to put a 100% of my net
[3363.839s] worth as the equity. So, if I&#39;m right, I
[3367.839s] make 20x on a double or whatever. And if
[3372.64s] I&#39;m wrong, they get the whole business
[3373.839s] and I get wiped out. If the answer is
[3376.799s] yes, I would do that deal, then I make
[3378.799s] it a position. If the answer is no, why
[3380.96s] would I even buy one share? So, um, as
[3385.04s] far as buying the S&amp;P, it&#39;s like asking
[3386.88s] me, do I like vanilla ice cream? I mean,
[3391.2s] no, man. I like Graham Central Station
[3394.079s] at Handles
[3396.72s] in Orange County. They got a few of
[3398.64s] them. They&#39;ve got Irvine, they got
[3400.24s] Newport, they got Huntington Beach.
[3403.52s] Best ice cream you&#39;ll ever have.
[3406.559s] Never thought I would like it, but I
[3408.0s] asked the guy, &quot;What&#39;s the number one
[3409.599s] number three sellers?&quot; He said, &quot;Cookie
[3411.28s] Monster,
[3412.88s] Grand Central Station,
[3415.119s] and something else I would never eat.&quot;
[3416.96s] So, pass on the blue Cookie Monster.
[3419.119s] Tried the Grand Central Station.
[3421.839s] Worst thing I ever did because
[3424.079s] unfortunately, I can walk there. And if
[3427.68s] I walk there and get Grand Central
[3429.359s] Station, I better walk 18 holes the next
[3431.44s] day.
[3433.44s] Uh, Joseph Gualtieri,
[3437.04s] would you take a look at Jack?
[3439.92s] Been looking at Jack every week for many
[3443.359s] weeks and I want to buy it and I&#39;m not
[3446.48s] going to
[3449.76s] because it&#39;s a mediocre business. It&#39;s
[3452.24s] on the West Coast. We&#39;re probably a
[3453.92s] little over restauranted,
[3457.04s] but
[3459.04s] this thing seems to have nine lives. So,
[3461.44s] I think you&#39;re going to be right and I
[3463.44s] think I&#39;m not going to participate.
[3466.72s] But in the meantime,
[3470.64s] let&#39;s take a look.
[3476.559s] Jack,
[3485.44s] who&#39;s this guy? Joseph Gualtieri. A guy
[3488.96s] after my own heart. What are we doing
[3490.72s] here? Cash flow starting to recovery.
[3493.44s] Margins are okay.
[3496.72s] Returns on capital have been crap.
[3500.4s] Turnaround story. So, just tell me what
[3501.839s] the turnaround is. That&#39;s all I want to
[3503.44s] know. You&#39;re tempting me, but you&#39;re not
[3506.24s] exciting me. Um,
[3514.079s] take a look at the balance sheet.
[3531.44s] Better look at it quarterly because it&#39;s
[3534.079s] not looking good annual. Not a lot of
[3536.24s] cash.
[3555.839s] You got 1.6 billion of debt and 75
[3559.359s] million in cash.
[3561.52s] That&#39;s not good, my friend. And that&#39;s
[3563.2s] probably why I keep passing on it. I
[3564.96s] mean, they&#39;ll probably do some cockamame
[3566.72s] raise now that the market&#39;s up,
[3571.04s] but that&#39;s a binary event.
[3578.48s] They&#39;ve got
[3584.0s] 19 million shares. Outstanding.
[3598.96s] 5 million shares at 20 bucks. They raise
[3601.44s] 100 million.
[3604.799s] They dilute you 20%. They live another
[3606.96s] day.
[3608.72s] It&#39;s probably pricing in some dilution.
[3613.839s] Just tell me how they&#39;re how&#39;s the
[3615.359s] business going to turn around? Do they
[3616.72s] have new products? Last time I checked,
[3618.16s] they&#39;re just trying to sell everything
[3619.2s] under the sun, throwing against,
[3620.96s] excuse my language, against the wall and
[3623.04s] hoping something sticks. I think
[3625.04s] something&#39;s going to stick. I&#39;ve eaten
[3626.4s] there before. It&#39;s okay.
[3629.2s] I I don&#39;t know. I think you&#39;re going to
[3630.799s] be right on this one, but I think you
[3632.16s] really got to do some work on it. I do
[3633.839s] think you&#39;re going to be right. Just
[3635.599s] instinct, but like as far as risking my
[3637.839s] and other people&#39;s money on it before
[3639.68s] doing a ton of work, no. Maybe I&#39;ll go
[3642.48s] listen to a few conference calls and
[3644.72s] take a look. But yeah, it keeps showing
[3646.88s] up on my list and I keep probably
[3649.92s] because I keep worrying about solveny
[3651.52s] risk, but uh yeah, I gota maybe dig a
[3653.839s] little deeper. It&#39;s in the discretionary
[3655.599s] category. I like that. Bob Atkins asks
[3658.079s] about Kagra C A.
[3665.02s] [Music]
[3667.52s] Uh let&#39;s see.
[3674.079s] Love these defensives getting smacked.
[3677.52s] What is this?
[3680.0s] This is not my thing. C A G
[3700.88s] I think you&#39;re on the right track.
[3704.72s] What do these guys make again? It&#39;s a
[3707.359s] food business. It&#39;s kind of like
[3711.359s] packaged foods. This is like the most
[3713.359s] hated group in the world right now.
[3717.68s] Packaged foods with uh
[3721.359s] RFK Jr., Bird&#39;s Eye, Merry Calendar,
[3724.24s] Duncan Hind, Healthy Choice, Slim Gym,
[3727.839s] Ready Whip, Boom, Chicka Pop Brands,
[3732.559s] Incorporated in 1919.
[3744.559s] Wake me up at $17 a share. I may never
[3747.76s] get it. Let&#39;s take a look at the balance
[3749.2s] sheet.
[3759.599s] I prefer Hormell, but let&#39;s just take a
[3762.0s] look.
[3764.72s] Manual.
[3768.0s] This is Yeah. So, this is probably your
[3769.839s] issue. No, this this is a problem. I&#39;m
[3772.799s] not sure how they solve for this, but
[3774.96s] they got $7.2 billion of debt and $77
[3777.76s] million of cash.
[3782.24s] I mean, they&#39;ve been running like that
[3783.52s] for a while, but
[3795.76s] 1.6 billion of free cash flow
[3800.0s] last year.
[3808.48s] I think it&#39;s worth doing some work on.
[3810.16s] It&#39;s not for me. It has to get a lot
[3811.92s] lower,
[3813.52s] but
[3815.44s] I like the idea.
[3817.92s] Alex Co,
[3825.2s] great podcast. Thanks for sharing your
[3826.559s] knowledge every week. Will needing if
[3829.28s] you think Adobe is bottoming out and
[3832.16s] worth a look. I&#39;m not in love with any
[3834.88s] software stocks right now because I
[3836.96s] don&#39;t know how AI is going to affect
[3840.48s] them. That&#39;s always been like why
[3842.799s] Buffett&#39;s, you know, you just changes I
[3847.359s] I think you&#39;re probably going to be okay
[3848.88s] with that. I think I&#39;m probably not
[3850.96s] interested in it
[3859.2s] right now. They&#39;re doing fine. I mean,
[3860.88s] it&#39;s like Google search. It&#39;s like
[3862.88s] they&#39;re great until they&#39;re not or
[3864.48s] they&#39;re great period and it&#39;s an over
[3866.799s] overwhelming fear that goes in my two
[3868.72s] hard box. I don&#39;t know enough about the
[3871.28s] software and the moat. I understand
[3873.28s] creators use it and it&#39;s the thing and
[3875.039s] blah blah blah, but I don&#39;t I don&#39;t even
[3877.44s] know what I don&#39;t know about how AI is
[3880.24s] going to disrupt that. I do know they&#39;re
[3882.16s] not going to disrupt putting tar
[3884.079s] shingles on roofs with QXO and Brad
[3886.96s] Jacobs.
[3888.799s] They&#39;re just going to make them more
[3889.839s] efficient and bring more profits to the
[3892.079s] bottom line. Eduardo Gonzalez, want to
[3894.64s] thank you for all the great information
[3895.839s] on the content podcast. A longtime
[3897.44s] follower, thank you. And now I can&#39;t
[3900.16s] wait every week to watch your new
[3901.2s] podcast for the week. I work on the oil
[3902.559s] field since 2008. Awesome. Star
[3905.28s] investing 2019.
[3908.24s] Go with the flow.
[3910.319s] I found you and heard you were pounding
[3911.839s] the table on banks when no one wanted
[3913.359s] them.
[3916.799s] invested in focus. Thank you for all you
[3918.64s] do.
[3921.68s] Can&#39;t be one of your clients yet. Don&#39;t
[3923.52s] have a million bucks. Okay. Uh ask you
[3926.48s] about Brazilian company Petro.
[3929.92s] Is it worth it to take a look? Yes,
[3932.319s] Petro Boss is always worth it to take a
[3934.0s] look except when Lula is in power
[3937.599s] and could cut the dividend any day he
[3940.0s] wants. He probably won&#39;t. It&#39;s run too
[3942.88s] much. I think your better play right now
[3945.28s] is some of the highest quality
[3948.16s] servicesers. Mark Thompson,
[3952.16s] could you take a look at Yeti? We&#39;ve
[3953.359s] looked at Yeti many times. Good
[3955.359s] business,
[3957.039s] good price,
[3958.88s] probably okay. Consumer discretionary,
[3964.0s] beat to death,
[3967.28s] will bounce back.
[3971.44s] the Louis Vuitton
[3974.16s] of ice coolers for rednecks and people
[3977.839s] like me who like to go to parades on the
[3980.799s] 4th of July.
[3983.44s] Uh
[3992.079s] it&#39;s not there&#39;s not a lot not to love
[3994.16s] here. Obviously got ahead of itself
[3995.92s] during co
[3998.079s] I think you&#39;re okay with this one. I
[3999.68s] I&#39;ve looked at it a million times. I
[4001.359s] haven&#39;t pulled the trigger yet because
[4002.64s] we have discretionary exposure, but I
[4004.559s] think you&#39;re right, Mark.
[4007.76s] Jerome Parker
[4013.28s] BXMT Blackstone Office.
[4020.0s] Uh,
[4030.88s] it&#39;s not an office read. It&#39;s a mortgage
[4032.72s] trust. So, pass.
[4038.0s] Completely opaque. Henry
[4041.76s] Dubil,
[4044.0s] huge fan of the podcast. Been spreading
[4045.52s] the good word on hedge fund tips to
[4047.28s] friends and family. Thank you for that.
[4049.44s] By the way, if you&#39;re getting value and
[4052.559s] you can&#39;t afford to become a client,
[4056.88s] what I suggest or ask you to do is leave
[4059.52s] a kind comment in the YouTube comments
[4063.28s] or leave any comment, kind or not. Uh
[4067.92s] that helps more people get exposed to
[4069.76s] the video. More people that get exposed
[4071.359s] to the video, the longer we&#39;re going to
[4072.48s] do this for non-clients.
[4074.88s] and um
[4079.44s] share the word. Share it with one person
[4081.44s] you love who you know loves the markets
[4083.119s] but doesn&#39;t know what the hell they&#39;re
[4084.319s] doing and hopefully we can help them
[4086.16s] out.
[4088.48s] Curious if you have any thoughts on
[4089.92s] Charter Communications trading at 50%
[4092.0s] off the 2021 high blah blah blah.
[4096.64s] Uh your guess is as good as mine on
[4099.44s] Charter. I continue to look at it.
[4101.839s] Continued to do nothing.
[4108.56s] It&#39;s gone up while I&#39;ve continued to do
[4110.48s] nothing. I just I can&#39;t really get
[4114.0s] excited about linear. Even the high
[4116.319s] speed, there&#39;s going to be some
[4117.92s] disruption in rural areas.
[4121.839s] Uh, no. I think you&#39;re right, but I&#39;m
[4125.199s] not interested.
[4127.199s] Manny B.
[4130.08s] CNC CNC got smashed on the surprise
[4133.759s] Medicaid cuts in the big beautiful bill.
[4140.159s] Uh I think you got to listen to the next
[4142.319s] call
[4143.92s] and hear what management has to say
[4145.679s] about there&#39;s a Rosie tomorrow. But for
[4148.319s] the time being, all these institutional
[4150.96s] players are smashed. It&#39;s going to take
[4153.279s] a while to build a new holder base.
[4156.719s] They&#39;ve had a huge run on Obamacare. You
[4159.44s] can see the stock went bananas since
[4162.319s] Obama got in power.
[4164.88s] Little bit of a break under Trump and
[4167.199s] continuation under Biden.
[4170.56s] Seems like that day is over. At at some
[4173.52s] price, it gets very attractive.
[4177.12s] I think it&#39;s early as a major long-term
[4179.839s] holding as a trade. It probably gets a
[4182.4s] bounce in the next couple of months now
[4184.799s] that the bad news is out.
[4187.679s] Uh, I think you keep your eyes on it.
[4189.679s] Right now, it&#39;s a falling knife, but I
[4191.44s] like your style,
[4194.56s] Martin
[4197.04s] Grizz
[4199.36s] Grizzki.
[4204.48s] Martin Grizzy Wazooi,
[4206.96s] what are your thoughts on We just
[4209.28s] covered Santine. There you go.
[4213.52s] Uh, two people had the same question.
[4215.76s] Thank you for sending it in. Robert,
[4224.4s] following your podcast from Germany.
[4226.96s] Greetings. You have a long reach. I
[4228.719s] don&#39;t have saved enough that Great Hill
[4230.48s] Capital could take care of my portfolio.
[4232.8s] I&#39;m wondering if you would accept
[4234.48s] clients from overseas.
[4236.719s] Well, why don&#39;t you give me a call after
[4239.12s] you save the money and we&#39;ll see if we
[4241.04s] can make that work. But in the meantime,
[4243.52s] I&#39;m grateful for you tuning in and
[4245.28s] getting some value out of the podcast
[4247.04s] and improving your understanding of
[4249.679s] markets.
[4251.52s] Do you think if now would be a good time
[4253.44s] to invest in health tech ETF?
[4259.199s] Is the MCI World Healthcare and ETF you
[4262.719s] would recommend?
[4265.12s] I don&#39;t really recommend ETFs. I like
[4267.199s] XBI now because rates are going to come
[4269.28s] down. I&#39;ve liked XBI for a while. It
[4271.36s] hasn&#39;t done anything, but it&#39;s going to
[4272.719s] start doing stuff now. It&#39;s just been
[4275.36s] grinding sideways. We&#39;re going to the
[4277.84s] promised land. Ah, detour. Going to the
[4280.48s] promised land. I think now we&#39;re
[4281.76s] actually going to go uh Msei World
[4284.88s] Healthcare.
[4287.12s] MSCI
[4289.44s] World
[4292.8s] Health.
[4303.199s] Oh, this is like a German thing.
[4311.6s] I think it&#39;s Let&#39;s just XLV.
[4315.44s] Yeah, I think you I think you buy the
[4317.679s] biotech basket. That&#39;s going to give you
[4319.199s] the biggest bang for the buck. If you&#39;re
[4320.32s] going to do healthcare, you got to pick
[4321.52s] discreet names. We&#39;ve talked about a
[4322.96s] bunch of them over the weeks, but I
[4324.64s] think your your thinking is correct.
[4326.32s] You&#39;re buying what&#39;s out of favor. Uh
[4328.4s] this is Jim coming in. We already talked
[4330.719s] your setup. I think you&#39;re if you&#39;re not
[4333.199s] approved, you&#39;re almost approved. Um
[4336.159s] okay. So, that&#39;s that. With that said,
[4337.92s] we&#39;ll be back next week. Same time, same
[4341.04s] place. We&#39;ll actually be back in
[4343.04s] California by next week. We&#39;re quick
[4345.199s] trip Thursday to Wednesday and uh that
[4349.12s] will be episode 300. How exciting is
[4353.679s] that? 300 episodes, almost six years.
[4358.4s] Super grateful for this incredible
[4360.64s] audience. Uh super grateful to hear the
[4363.12s] amazing stories. Matter of fact, my
[4365.12s] assistant Jennifer
[4367.12s] had her pulling all the testimonials
[4368.8s] from emails and from uh comments and all
[4372.64s] the like. She&#39;s got, you know, if you go
[4374.8s] to hedgefundtips.com
[4377.12s] and you click on number one podcast and
[4380.159s] you see all the people who have bought
[4383.679s] hedge fun tips with Tom Hayes merch. Uh,
[4387.6s] but beyond that, you see like 30 pages
[4390.32s] of testimonials.
[4392.719s] Look at all these awesome people.
[4396.32s] And then you just see tons and tons of
[4397.92s] testimonials. Well, I finally I got her
[4401.28s] to pull together another 20 pages of
[4404.08s] testimonials. So, we&#39;re going to have
[4406.239s] those there as well. So grateful for you
[4408.32s] guys. Uh we&#39;ll be back next week. In the
[4411.44s] meantime, make it a great one. Bye for
[4415.28s] now.
