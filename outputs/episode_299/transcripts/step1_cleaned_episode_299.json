Each week we try to cover one to two companies we&#39;ve discussed in previous podcast video cast for our own clients, including personally I eat my own cooking. In late 2023, we came out publicly with a new position in Comtock Resources, a name that had been left for dead and one you practically couldn&#39;t give away. A combination of record domestic natural gas production, flooding inventories, milder weather, lowering demand, and being blindsided by policies slowing LNG export projects crushed the stock and sent natural gas prices to their lowest inflation adjusted levels since they began trading on the NY in 1990. We saw this as an opportunity and started adding around $8 a share basis. Two things stood out to us that made Comtock a no-brainer. First, we were investing with Jerry Jones. Second, Comtock is the lowest cost producer with a cost structure that&#39;s 48% lower than pure averages. We believe in the long-term natural gas theme, and Comtock is undoubtedly the most efficiently run pure play in the space. Comtock was quietly playing offense looking for the next big drilling opportunity. management spent the last 5 years studying geologic data and signing over 20,000 new drilling leases across a massive 520,000 netacre footprint in the western Hannesville region. This region is still virtually undeveloped with management calling it the holy grail because they expect it to yield significantly more resource potential per section than their legacy Hannesville assets with potential for thousands of future drilling locations. Meanwhile, it&#39;s perfectly situated about 100 miles from both Houston and Dallas prime locations for future data centers that management is already in discussions for. With LG capacity growing and AI and data centers driving electricity demand to record levels, the real question over the next few years will be where will all the natural gas come from? Comtock will happily be there to answer just that. US electricity consumption from the EIA 1990 to 2026 is up close to 60%. US Henry Hub natural gas spot price going up. Global energy.\n\nMeanwhile, it&#39;s perfectly situated about 100 miles from both Houston and Dallas prime locations for future data centers that management is already in discussions for. This is on top of its proximity to the Gulf of America, which is home to more than hundred billion dollar in LG terminals and continues to rapidly expand. With LG capacity growing and AI and data centers driving electricity demand to record levels, the real question over the next few years will be where will all the natural gas come from? Comtock will happily be there to answer just that. Chat GPT queries are six to 10 times as power intensive as traditional Google searches. US electricity consumption from the EIA 1990 to 2026 is up close to 60%. US Henry Hub natural gas spot price going up. Oh, and by the way, this is all happening while managers are still sitting near record low allocation to the energy sector. This move will be hated on the way up and chased when it&#39;s too late. We will be smiling so wide we could eat a banana sideways. Global energy. Here&#39;s institutional quote unquote smart money positioning. Going to miss the boat again. One standard deviation below its long-term average. And here are some uh highlights from the earnings. Operating cash flow was 239 million. all the numbers, all the metrics going up. \n### FEATURED_COMPANY_DEEP_DIVES\nAlibaba update. A few weeks ago, Alibaba released its annual letter to shareholders despite the price action which we welcomed as it gave us a chance to put new money to work for the first time in a while. The biggest takeaway is that the business continues to fire on all cylinders. Nothing we didn&#39;t already know, but here are a few highlights worth noting. International commerce remains on track to achieve its first profitable quarter in the coming fiscal year. Other profit previously loss-making businesses are now on track to reach profitability. Revenue from AI related products post posted tripledigit growth for seven consecutive quarters. This is the cheapest best AI play in the world. I&#39;ll repeat it. Revenue from AI related products posted tripledigit growth for seven consecutive quarters, helping drive overall cloud revenue back into doubledigit growth. Number one cloud player, number one retailer to the middle class. International growth booming. Management repurchased 11.9 billion worth of shares during the year, reducing the share count by 5.1%. That was on top of 4 billion in dividends and special dividends paid during the year with another 4.6 billion in dividends already announced for the current year. Alibaba reigns the number one e-commerce platform in China with total e-commerce now making up nearly 27% of retail consumption and reaching over 1.1 billion internet users. Management is doubling down on instant commerce offering nearly 7 billion in coupons over the next year to gain share. Daily orders have already reached 80 million and twice daily active users have passed 200 million greater around 40% of market share in just three months. Sentiment is getting a little bit too greedy. So maybe we get a little pause in the rally. And congrats to everyone who came in this quarter. Very excited for you. Very grateful to have you on board.\n### MACRO_DATA_SLIDES\nDefense and Aerospace earnings estimates, revisions, top 30 weights, revisions in the last 60 days for this year up 86 bips. Next year up 90 pips, almost 1%. Energy down up down ratio. Oh, sorry. Uh down 1.68% and 2026 down 2.09%. Let&#39;s take a look at some economic data. Small business optimism still pretty high, little less than expectations. Consumer credit is low lower that you we got to bring those rates down to get some credit expansion to make this thing hum. Welcome to capitalism. And we got initial and continuing tomorrow. And then we got some inflation I believe next week which is going to be the key numbers. C CPI on Tuesday that&#39;ll be right before I go on Vney. PPI on Wednesday. Retail sales on Thursday. Busy week. We talked about earnings expectations. So we got that.

Is there something to be concerned about? uh your investment framework is to be concerned about. Um you&#39;re focused on price versus value and uh and that&#39;s how you wind up getting flushed out of great stocks and tempted by mediocre stocks. So beware. Um question, what do you say about Arrow Electronics? I&#39;m guessing this is not going to be something that fits in our framework, but let me be open-minded. I&#39;m ### ASK_ME_ANYTHING_QA\nFBI, great question, by the way. I hope you have more in the future. FBI, Fortune Brands. This is interesting. Okay. So, price just followed cash flow. Let me do something else here. FBI N. Okay. So cash flow collapsed for a little while. Revenues have been flat to down for a while. Margins are starting to tick up. \nwhat do you think about valet stepping uh stepping on Albamaro&#39;s toes in the material space which I have a position by the way? Albamar is starting to rock, isn&#39;t it? \nI don&#39;t like Valet. I don&#39;t like Tinto. I do like Albamar though. \nDavid T, can you take a look at WFRD? Possibly better than SLB as far as turnaround is concerned. WFR D. Oh, the old Weatherford. I forgot why I hate this business, but let&#39;s take a look at it. Maybe it was a bankruptcy reorg. WFRD? Yeah, looks like it was a bankruptcy reorg. Maybe they&#39;ll get it right this time. But there&#39;s probably some of the same actors involved. I would check that out. I n&#39;t take the second prettiest girl in the in the ugliest industry. Take the prettiest girl to the prom.\nMatthew Gy on the podcast, you can speak your thoughts on investing the S&P right now given very high valuations. All right. Your numbers are wrong, but your thesis is correct. Do you think it&#39;s time to sell? I don&#39;t know. I mean, when you&#39;re asking me about the S&P 500, you&#39;re asking me about MAG 7. I don&#39;t have a view. We&#39;re not correlated to the S&P. Yes, if the market goes down a lot, our our names will be hit. But if the market grinds sideway, we&#39;re going to we&#39;re going to make a killing. So, I that&#39;s kind of my base case. Sideways, maybe five to 10% pullbacks in the fall. Uh but being in the right names, it&#39;s not not even going to matter. I don&#39;t I don&#39;t even think about the indices. That&#39;s like that&#39;s the farthest thing from my mind. I just look at on a business by business basis.\nJoseph Gualtieri, would you take a look at Jack? Been looking at Jack every week for many weeks and I want to buy it and I&#39;m not going to because it&#39;s a mediocre business. It&#39;s on the West Coast. We&#39;re probably a little over restauranted, but this thing seems to have nine lives. So, I think you&#39;re going to be right and I think I&#39;m not going to participate. But in the meantime, let&#39;s take a look. Jack, who&#39;s this guy? Joseph Gualtieri. A guy after my own heart.\nBob Atkins asks about Kagra C A. \nAlex Co, great podcast. Thanks for sharing your knowledge every week. Will needing if you think Adobe is bottoming out and worth a look. I&#39;m not in love with any software stocks right now because I don&#39;t know how AI is going to affect them. That&#39;s always been like why Buffett&#39;s, you know, you just changes I I think you&#39;re probably going to be okay with that. I think I&#39;m probably not interested in it right now. They&#39;re doing fine. I mean, it&#39;s like Google search. It&#39;s like they&#39;re great until they&#39;re not or they&#39;re great period and it&#39;s an over overwhelming fear that goes in my two hard box. I don&#39;t know enough about the software and the moat. I understand creators use it and it&#39;s the thing and blah blah blah, but I don&#39;t I don&#39;t even know what I don&#39;t know about how AI is going to disrupt that. I do know they&#39;re not going to disrupt putting tar shingles on roofs with QXO and Brad Jacobs. They&#39;re just going to make them more efficient and bring more profits to the bottom line.\nEduardo Gonzalez, want to thank you for all the great information on the content podcast.

Yes, Petro Boss is always worth it to take a look except when Lula is in power and could cut the dividend any day he wants. He probably won&#39;t. It&#39;s run too much. I think your better play right now is some of the highest quality servicesers.\nMark Thompson, could you take a look at Yeti? We&#39;ve looked at Yeti many times.

By the way, if you&#39;re getting value and you can&#39;t afford to become a client, what I suggest or ask you to do is leave a kind comment in the YouTube comments or leave any comment, kind or not.

Share it with one person you love who you know loves the markets but doesn&#39;t know what the hell they&#39;re doing and hopefully we can help them out. Curious if you have any thoughts on Charter Communications trading at 50% off the 2021 high blah blah blah. Uh your guess is as good as mine on Charter. I continue to look at it. Continued to do nothing. It&#39;s gone up while I&#39;ve continued to do nothing. I just I can&#39;t really get excited about linear.

But for the time being, all these institutional players are smashed. It&#39;s going to take a while to build a new holder base. They&#39;ve had a huge run on Obamacare. You can see the stock went bananas since Obama got in power. Little bit of a break under Trump and continuation under Biden. Seems like that day is over. At at some price, it gets very attractive. I think it&#39;s early as a major long-term holding as a trade. It probably gets a bounce in the next couple of months now that the bad news is out. Uh, I think you keep your eyes on it. Right now, it&#39;s a falling knife, but I like your style, Martin Grizz Grizzki. Martin Grizzy Wazooi, what are your thoughts on We just covered Santine. There you go. Uh, two people had the same question. Thank you for sending it in.\nRobert, following your podcast from Germany. Greetings. You have a long reach. I don&#39;t have saved enough that Great Hill Capital could take care of my portfolio. I&#39;m wondering if you would accept clients from overseas. Well, why don&#39;t you give me a call after you save the money and we&#39;ll see if we can make that work. But in the meantime, I&#39;m grateful for you tuning in and getting some value out of the podcast and improving your understanding of markets. Do you think if now would be a good time to invest in health tech ETF? Is the MCI World Healthcare and ETF you would recommend? I don&#39;t really recommend ETFs. I like XBI now because rates are going to come down. I&#39;ve liked XBI for a while. It hasn&#39;t done anything, but it&#39;s going to start doing stuff now. It&#39;s just been grinding sideways. We&#39;re going to the promised land. Ah, detour. Going to the promised land. I think now we&#39;re actually going to go uh Msei World Healthcare. MSCI World Health. Oh, this is like a German thing. I think it&#39;s Let&#39;s just XLV. Yeah, I think you I think you buy the biotech basket. That&#39;s going to give you the biggest bang for the buck. If you&#39;re going to do healthcare, you got to pick discreet names. We&#39;ve talked about a bunch of them over the weeks, but I think your your thinking is correct. You&#39;re buying what&#39;s out of favor. Uh this is Jim coming in. We already talked your setup. I think you&#39;re if you&#39;re not approved, you&#39;re almost approved. Um okay. So, that&#39;s that.\n\nI think it&#39;s early as a major long-term holding as a trade. It probably gets a bounce in the next couple of months now that the bad news is out. Uh, I think you keep your eyes on it. Right now, it&#39;s a falling knife. \n### ASK_ME_ANYTHING_QA\nI like XBI now because rates are going to come down. I&#39;ve liked XBI for a while.

Each week we try to cover one to two companies we&#39;ve discussed in previous podcast video cast for our own clients, including personally I eat my own cooking. In late 2023, we came out publicly with a new position in Comtock Resources, a name that had been left for dead and one you practically couldn&#39;t give away. A combination of record domestic natural gas production, flooding inventories, milder weather, lowering demand, and being blindsided by policies slowing LNG export projects crushed the stock and sent natural gas prices to their lowest inflation adjusted levels since they began trading on the NY in 1990. We saw this as an opportunity and started adding around $8 a share basis. Two things stood out to us that made Comtock a no-brainer. First, we were investing with Jerry Jones. Second, Comtock is the lowest cost producer with a cost structure that&#39;s 48% lower than pure averages. We believe in the long-term natural gas theme, and Comtock is undoubtedly the most efficiently run pure play in the space. Comtock was quietly playing offense looking for the next big drilling opportunity. management spent the last 5 years studying geologic data and signing over 20,000 new drilling leases across a massive 520,000 netacre footprint in the western Hannesville region. This region is still virtually undeveloped with management calling it the holy grail because they expect it to yield significantly more resource potential per section than their legacy Hannesville assets with potential for thousands of future drilling locations. Meanwhile, it&#39;s perfectly situated about 100 miles from both Houston and Dallas prime locations for future data centers that management is already in discussions for. With LG capacity growing and AI and data centers driving electricity demand to record levels, the real question over the next few years will be where will all the natural gas come from? Comtock will happily be there to answer just that. US electricity consumption from the EIA 1990 to 2026 is up close to 60%. US Henry Hub natural gas spot price going up. Global energy.",

A few weeks ago, Alibaba released its annual letter to shareholders despite the price action which we welcomed as it gave us a chance to put new money to work for the first time in a while. The biggest takeaway is that the business continues to fire on all cylinders. Nothing we didn&#39;t already know, but here are a few highlights worth noting. International commerce remains on track to achieve its first profitable quarter in the coming fiscal year. Other profit previously loss-making businesses are now on track to reach profitability. Revenue from AI related products post posted tripledigit growth for seven consecutive quarters. This is the cheapest best AI play in the world. I&#39;ll repeat it. Revenue from AI related products posted tripledigit growth for seven consecutive quarters, helping drive overall cloud revenue back into doubledigit growth. Number one cloud player, number one retailer to the middle class. International growth booming. Management repurchased 11.9 billion worth of shares during the year, reducing the share count by 5.1%. That was on top of 4 billion in dividends and special dividends paid during the year with another 4.6 billion in dividends already announced for the current year. Alibaba reigns the number one e-commerce platform in China with total e-commerce now making up nearly 27% of retail consumption and reaching over 1.1 billion internet users. Management is doubling down on instant commerce offering nearly 7 billion in coupons over the next year to gain share. Daily orders have already reached 80 million and twice daily active users have passed 200 million greater around 40% of market share in just three months. Sentiment is getting a little bit too greedy. So maybe we get a little pause in the rally. And congrats to everyone who came in this quarter. Very excited for you.

Trump&#39;s energy department warns American could face 800 hours of blackouts by 2030. \n\nComto stock resources update. Each week we try to cover one to two companies we&#39;ve discussed in previous podcast video cast for our own clients, including personally I eat my own cooking. In late 2023, we came out publicly with a new position in Comtock Resources, a name that had been left for dead and one you practically couldn&#39;t give away. A combination of record domestic natural gas production, flooding inventories, milder weather, lowering demand, and being blindsided by policies slowing LNG export projects crushed the stock and sent natural gas prices to their lowest inflation adjusted levels since they began trading on the NY in 1990. We saw this as an opportunity and started adding around $8 a share basis. Two things stood out to us that made Comtock a no-brainer. First, we were investing with Jerry Jones. Second, Comtock is the lowest cost producer with a cost structure that&#39;s 48% lower than pure averages. We believe in the long-term natural gas theme, and Comtock is undoubtedly the most efficiently run pure play in the space. Comtock was quietly playing offense looking for the next big drilling opportunity. management spent the last 5 years studying geologic data and signing over 20,000 new drilling leases across a massive 520,000 netacre footprint in the western Hannesville region. This region is still virtually undeveloped with management calling it the holy grail because they expect it to yield significantly more resource potential per section than their legacy Hannesville assets with potential for thousands of future drilling locations. Meanwhile, it&#39;s perfectly situated about 100 miles from both Houston and Dallas prime locations for future data centers that management is already in discussions for. With LG capacity growing and AI and data centers driving electricity demand to record levels, the real question over the next few years will be where will all the natural gas come from? Comtock will happily be there to answer just that. US electricity consumption from the EIA 1990 to 2026 is up close to 60%. US Henry Hub natural gas spot price going up. Global energy.\n\nMeanwhile, it&#39;s perfectly situated about 100 miles from both Houston and Dallas prime locations for future data centers that management is already in discussions for. This is on top of its proximity to the Gulf of America, which is home to more than hundred billion dollar in LG terminals and continues to rapidly expand. With LG capacity growing and AI and data centers driving electricity demand to record levels, the real question over the next few years will be where will all the natural gas come from? Comtock will happily be there to answer just that. Chat GPT queries are six to 10 times as power intensive as traditional Google searches. US electricity consumption from the EIA 1990 to 2026 is up close to 60%. US Henry Hub natural gas spot price going up. Oh, and by the way, this is all happening while managers are still sitting near record low allocation to the energy sector. This move will be hated on the way up and chased when it&#39;s too late. We will be smiling so wide we could eat a banana sideways. Global energy. Here&#39;s institutional quote unquote smart money positioning. Going to miss the boat again. One standard deviation below its long-term average. And here are some uh highlights from the earnings. Operating cash flow was 239 million. all the numbers, all the metrics going up. \n### FEATURED_COMPANY_DEEP_DIVES\nAlibaba update. A few weeks ago, Alibaba released its annual letter to shareholders despite the price action which we welcomed as it gave us a chance to put new money to work for the first time in a while. The biggest takeaway is that the business continues to fire on all cylinders. Nothing we didn&#39;t already know, but here are a few highlights worth noting. International commerce remains on track to achieve its first profitable quarter in the coming fiscal year. Other profit previously loss-making businesses are now on track to reach profitability. Revenue from AI related products post posted tripledigit growth for seven consecutive quarters. This is the cheapest best AI play in the world. I&#39;ll repeat it. Revenue from AI related products posted tripledigit growth for seven consecutive quarters, helping drive overall cloud revenue back into doubledigit growth. Number one cloud player, number one retailer to the middle class. International growth booming. Management repurchased 11.9 billion worth of shares during the year, reducing the share count by 5.1%.

Your numbers are wrong, but your thesis is correct. Do you think it&#39;s time to sell? I don&#39;t know. I mean, when you&#39;re asking me about the S&P 500, you&#39;re asking me about MAG 7. I don&#39;t have a view. We&#39;re not correlated to the S&P. Yes, if the market goes down a lot, our our names will be hit. But if the market grinds sideway, we&#39;re going to we&#39;re going to make a killing. So, I that&#39;s kind of my base case. Sideways, maybe five to 10% pullbacks in the fall. Uh but being in the right names, it&#39;s not not even going to matter. I don&#39;t I don&#39;t even think about the indices. That&#39;s like that&#39;s the farthest thing from my mind.

      "first thing I would mention is, uh, China stimulus is coming. Uh, they are definitely going to stimulate, uh, because their economy is slowing, uh, and they have to hit certain targets. So, uh, that&#39;s going to be good for, uh, Alibaba BABA, uh, in particular. Uh, I think that&#39;s, uh, that&#39;s going to be a big one. Uh, and then, uh, you",
      "conference call and I would suggest you do. It&#39;s funny, someone said to me, well, you can now you can just summarize all of them with chat GPT. I said, great. I hope you do that because you&#39;re never going to get the nuance and really understand and you&#39;re never you&#39;re going to lose all the edge. So summarize away and we will do the work. Alibaba update. A few weeks ago, Alibaba released its annual letter to shareholders despite the price action which we welcomed as it gave us a chance to put new money to work for the first time in a while. The biggest takeaway is that the business continues to fire on all cylinders. Nothing we didn&#39;t already know, but here are a few highlights worth noting. International commerce remains on track to achieve its first profitable quarter in the coming fiscal year. Other profit previously loss-making businesses are now on track to reach profitability. Revenue from AI related products post posted tripledigit growth for seven consecutive quarters. This is the cheapest best AI play in the world. I&#39;ll repeat it. Revenue from AI related products posted tripledigit growth for seven consecutive quarters, helping drive overall cloud revenue back into doubledigit growth. Number one cloud player, number one retailer to the middle class. International growth booming. Management repurchased 11.9 billion worth of shares during the year, reducing the share count by 5.1%. That was on top of 4 billion in dividends and special dividends paid during the year with another 4.6 billion in dividends already announced for the current year. Alibaba reigns the number one e-commerce platform in China with total e-commerce now making up nearly 27% of retail consumption and reaching over 1.1 billion internet users. Management is doubling down on instant commerce offering nearly 7 billion in coupons over the next year to gain share. Daily orders have already reached 80 million and twice daily active users have passed 200 million greater around 40% of market share in just three months. Sentiment is getting a little bit too greedy. So maybe we get a little pause in the rally. And congrats to everyone who came in this quarter. Very excited for you. Very grateful to have you on board.",
      "last 30 days PDD is up 3% while Baba is down 15%. Is there something to be concerned about? uh your investment framework is to be concerned about. Um you&#39;re focused on price versus value and uh and that&#39;s how you wind up getting flushed out of great stocks and tempted by mediocre stocks. So beware. Um question, what do you say about Arrow Electronics? I&#39;m guessing this is not going to be something that fits in our framework, but let me be open-minded. I&#39;m",
      "Hong Kong listings pipeline hits record high as equity market booms. All those fees should have been US banks. Instead, we gave it to China or Hong Kong. Calls grow for China's household sector to be bigger economic driver. That's going to benefit Baba. China June car sales hit record for the month on subsidy boost. It's funny. Western investors get so nervous when the government do does negative things, but when they do positive things, they don't believe they're going to work. You can't make this stuff up. But that's fine. Gave us more opportunity. By the way, first time in a long time that we've been able to put new money to work in Alibaba, which is super exciting. I I never thought it was going to get to a point where I'd want to put new money again. Uh just ride it to the promised land. It gave us another bite at the apple. You know, I was talking with a a just a great client of mine, by the way",
