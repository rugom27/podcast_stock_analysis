[214.68s] everything&#39;s going to be incredible over
[216.439s] there and I&#39;ll leave it at that and then
[218.959s] um for those of you are wondering you
[221.239s] know we talked about Goose last week my
[224.08s] vest came in by the way this is an
[226.12s] incredible vest because if you live in
[228.48s] the Northeast and you play paddle or
[230.12s] whatever that&#39;s what you wear when you
[232.799s] uh are out in the cold in the middle of
[234.36s] winter some type of vest and the
[236.4s] difference between this vest and the
[238.12s] Patagonia or any of the others for that
[240.36s] matter the others are very light and
[242.599s] they&#39;re great and they&#39;re tight fitting
[244.079s] and they warm you up this thing it&#39;s
[246.92s] like a piece of armor it&#39;s it&#39;s like
[249.159s] it&#39;s five pounds there&#39;s so much down in
[252.04s] there uh it&#39;s absolutely incredible uh I
[255.48s] was shocked by the amount of quality in
[258.0s] this so uh very very happy to have that
[260.199s] experience and then um I think that&#39;s it
[263.84s] on this this side oh this was very
[266.84s] interesting I was doing Channel checks
[268.759s] everywhere and this was the Nike
[271.6s] flagship store there were no lines
[273.28s] outside but it was it was pretty busy
[275.52s] inside I know we&#39;ve talked about that
[277.919s] this right here is Canada Goose see
[280.32s] goose in the window all of these people
[283.32s] are waiting
[285.4s] online and what you can see is it&#39;s all
[288.4s] different people but a lot of Asians
[290.68s] which is which is the play on China
[292.52s] Canada goo CH call it China Goose Canada
[295.68s] Goose uh this is a line and there&#39;s like
[298.4s] a a a
[300.6s] bouncer basically at the front door with
[302.84s] a clipboard and I&#39;m going to show you a
[304.28s] bunch more photos of the line at Canada
[306.32s] Goose I was shocked to see this because
[308.6s] no other stores except for Legos which
[312.08s] we don&#39;t own Legos uh had lines Legos
[315.52s] had a bigger line than Canada Goose but
[317.44s] Canada Goose had a line halfway down the
[319.28s] block to get in Prada no line so let me
[322.6s] show you some more of this stuff uh this
[324.96s] was Louis Vuitton by the way which is
[326.6s] also another beaten down luxury stock
[328.319s] that depends on the China recovery which
[329.919s] will happen uh they made the whole
[331.8s] building the suitcases for those of you
[333.84s] who watch Tik Tok I like my suitcase as
[336.639s] Baron would say here&#39;s the line for
[339.639s] Tiffany uh absolutely zero people on the
[342.88s] line for Tiffany Tiffany&#39;s classic like
[345.16s] all right so here&#39;s the bouncer for
[347.24s] Canada Goose standing at the front door
[349.039s] and this is where the line starts and it
[350.44s] wraps all the way around all the way
[353.52s] down halfway down the
[355.72s] block Gucci no line
[359.759s] here&#39;s the line again so you can get a
[361.52s] sense of it that guy in the red has a a
[364.68s] you know a tablet or a iPad or whatever
[366.96s] and he&#39;s going down the line taking
[368.96s] people&#39;s names giving them a wait time
[370.88s] to keep them engaged so they don&#39;t take
[372.4s] off here he is see see with the
[373.68s] clipboard and that&#39;s me at the end of
[375.56s] the
[376.52s] line that&#39;s the front of the
[379.919s] store and so you know some of you guys
[381.96s] think this is boring but this is a
[383.68s] critical Factor uh in some of the stuff
[387.08s] that you want to do you want to get as
[388.4s] granular as humanly POS POS you&#39;re
[390.0s] buying a piece of the business would you
[391.72s] buy uh a company you know Manufacturing
[394.759s] Company down the street that makes
[396.479s] widgets uh at seven times eida if you
[399.28s] didn&#39;t go go and visit the factory
[401.36s] probably not so um you know you you
[404.0s] could you want to do as much of that as
[405.599s] you can it&#39;s not as critical with public
[408.759s] companies because everything&#39;s audited
[410.56s] and uh looked over but the more you can
[412.84s] do it the better off uh onto the media
[415.56s] had the pleasure of joining Julie Heyman
[419.8s] Brian sazy just and I want to thank
[422.4s] Justin Oliver the producer and Cheyenne
[424.759s] Reed for having me on and I I literally
[428.16s] must have gotten seven phone calls and
[429.919s] text is that a virtual background no I
[432.919s] did that from our house in Connecticut
[435.4s] uh and um you know hats off to my wife
[438.44s] who&#39;s an incredible decorator I had
[440.08s] nothing to do with that and um we&#39;re
[442.879s] going to listen in now for a general
[444.479s] overview to kick this off and then we&#39;ll
[446.44s] be back big deal all right let&#39;s turn
[448.479s] now to some interesting investment place
[450.039s] to consider as the market rally
[451.4s] potentially broadens beh Beyond big Tech
[454.12s] into 2025 Thomas Hayes is with us he&#39;s
[456.44s] the chairman of managing member of great
[458.16s] Hill Capital Tom it&#39;s great to see you
[459.919s] so um we were just talking about that
[461.919s] broadening Trend if you were had to pick
[464.24s] now between large cap Tech and
[466.479s] everything else what are you
[468.919s] picking I think you follow the earnings
[471.08s] Julie and thank you for having me on
[472.8s] what we&#39;ve seen since the first quarter
[474.639s] of this year is the mag 7 earnings
[477.52s] growth has decelerated from 50% earnings
[481.159s] growth in the first quarter of this year
[483.12s] to Mid teens and what we&#39;re also seeing
[486.28s] is the
[488.199s] unmagnify have accelerated from negative
[491.96s] aggregate earnings growth to positive
[494.68s] and by early next year they will be low
[498.0s] double digits to Mid teen so you want to
[500.56s] follow the earnings and uh and the
[503.08s] unmagnify I think that&#39;s where you&#39;re
[504.599s] going to see things happen Tom it&#39;s uh
[507.28s] well good to see you uh it&#39;s been a
[508.879s] little while um look it&#39;s a holiday
[510.68s] shopping season give people some uh
[512.2s] presents in terms of some stock picks
[513.68s] what do you like what don&#39;t you
[515.399s] like well I think the biggest surprise
[517.839s] of 2025 is going to be that bonds get
[521.56s] bid okay we&#39;ve seen since bessent Scott
[525.0s] bessent was appointed as treasury
[527.12s] secretary uh and he put in his 333 plan
[530.399s] the 3% real GDP budget deficits below 3%
[534.279s] and add 3 million barrels per day uh
[537.279s] bonds have come yields have come in so
[540.24s] that&#39;s an opportunity to buy a little
[541.64s] longer out on the curve as for stocks as
[544.32s] for Christmas presents I got a perfect
[546.16s] one for you actually maybe two if we
[548.04s] have time I&#39;ve got Etsy Etsy has been
[550.88s] left for dead Etsy was a covid darling
[554.399s] the stock is down
[556.6s] 85% but what most people don&#39;t realize
[559.04s] it&#39;s the third most trafficed retail
[560.76s] website 92 million users and what&#39;s
[563.92s] really interesting about that Brian is
[565.76s] that they don&#39;t compete it&#39;s not a race
[567.76s] to the bottom on prices because the
[569.64s] things you can get on Etsy you can get
[571.88s] nowhere else and this is a company that
[573.92s] while the stock is down 85% they&#39;ve been
[576.72s] able to maintain all the users they
[578.88s] picked up during covid and maintain the
[581.279s] free cash flow generation is
[583.24s] reaccelerating 600 million plus trailing
[586.959s] 12 months a billion doll buyback
[589.2s] authorization growth in international
[591.56s] growth in men&#39;s growth in gifting growth
[594.48s] in loyalty programs we like this one um
[597.44s] and of course now I&#39;m seeing Brian sazy
[599.079s] next meing his holiday shopping I&#39;m
[602.76s] looking at digital prints I maybe you&#39;re
[604.12s] right here Tom I I can get a digital
[605.88s] print of my non-existent puppy and put
[608.16s] it right there on my desk this what else
[610.32s] she showing here is Bailey Bailey the
[611.72s] puppy on it&#39;s SC so Tom let me ask you
[613.72s] though because one of the reasons that
[614.959s] the stock has taken such a hit has been
[616.76s] sort of concerns about um that it hasn&#39;t
[620.2s] maintained that level of specialness
[623.959s] right that there are counterfeit Goods
[625.839s] on there that it&#39;s not as curated Etc
[629.32s] what do you think about that do you
[630.24s] think etsy&#39;s been doing a good job of
[631.64s] sort of addressing some of those
[634.2s] concerns no and yes no they haven&#39;t been
[637.44s] doing a good job that&#39;s why the stock&#39;s
[638.92s] down 85% yes they recognize the mistakes
[642.0s] they made and they&#39;re fixing it and
[643.68s] that&#39;s why we&#39;re seeing a re
[644.959s] acceleration of growth revenues proper
[647.88s] initiatives curation and uh and an
[651.44s] abandonment of what they were doing
[653.12s] which was trying to compete with people
[654.519s] that they don&#39;t compete with you know
[655.839s] Brian when you go out to get that
[656.959s] picture of your puppy you want to uh
[659.839s] engrave the recipient&#39;s name on that
[662.68s] picture and and it will make them feel
[664.32s] special I mean when you receive a
[666.2s] customized gift from a friend or family
[668.44s] member it&#39;s special because they took
[670.16s] extra time they were thoughtful about
[672.0s] you versus just scatter shotting 20
[674.639s] chocolate baskets from Amazon is is not
[676.68s] the most ideal situation anymore and now
[678.92s] I&#39;m gonna have to get a puppy I don&#39;t
[680.079s] have one but I just want to Popp I I
[681.399s] take a photo of and I want to share with
[682.6s] all you Tom before you came in here
[684.2s] Julie and I were having a chat on on
[685.6s] tech stocks and uh seeing some weakness
[687.48s] in the semiconductor names is there any
[689.519s] read through any cautionary signs from
[691.48s] some of these stocks that were some of
[693.88s] the favorites amongst investors now
[695.56s] getting tossed in the
[696.839s] trash well as it relates to Nvidia we we
[699.68s] saw a lot of retail uh investors Chase
[702.76s] into that after the split uh they got
[705.04s] some benefits but you know at the end of
[706.959s] the day you have a stock that&#39;s priced
[708.279s] for Perfection trading at some 40 times
[710.72s] sales 40 times forward earnings a lot
[713.16s] has to go right and the problem is there
[715.32s] was a period in time when Nvidia the
[718.2s] stock price went up and it actually got
[720.0s] cheaper because the multiple went down
[722.279s] that is no longer the case because
[724.0s] profit margins have Tapped Out uh
[726.959s] Revenue growth has capped out at a
[729.279s] measly $4 billion doar a quarter which
[732.16s] is still absolutely incredible but uh
[735.24s] the key is price is what you pay value
[736.88s] is what you get and at 40 time sales as
[739.12s] we move from training the models which
[742.04s] is where gpus are the most critical and
[744.519s] the spend for gpus is the most important
[746.44s] thing two the more efficient part of the
[749.279s] AI process which we&#39;re slowly shifting
[751.519s] into which is inference inference can be
[754.88s] done on more basic chips with lower
[757.44s] energy use lower demand uh more chips
[760.6s] but lower quality chips that&#39;s where the
[762.48s] amds of the world and the intels of the
[764.92s] world are going to start to arise from
[766.839s] the dead and the and the p is going to
[768.88s] be split up a little bit better so uh on
[771.24s] that basis maybe they can e out a couple
[772.92s] more quarters of stock growth but uh
[775.399s] where it&#39;s priced I think uh it&#39;s it&#39;s
[778.399s] certainly makes sense that it&#39;s
[780.6s] consolidating and stalling a little bit
[782.519s] and maybe even pulling back um I want to
[785.079s] come back to your bond call because I
[787.399s] find that kind of interesting Tom
[789.0s] because there are of of course all this
[790.76s] talk about tariffs maybe keeping rates
[794.48s] meaning the inflation&#39;s going to stay
[796.0s] higher meaning that rates are going to
[797.399s] stay higher for longer we&#39;re not going
[799.16s] to see as many Cuts how does that factor
[801.44s] into what you&#39;re
[803.12s] expecting well this was the exact same
[805.6s] thing that happened in Trump 1.0 he was
[808.24s] elected in November of 2016 the first
[811.199s] thing you saw was oh it&#39;s going to be
[813.16s] inflationary he&#39;s going to spend he&#39;s
[814.8s] the debt king or the you know the bond
[816.92s] King uh and and immediately uh long end
[820.44s] of the curb sold off aggressively after
[823.44s] the election and into his inauguration
[826.76s] and it was kind of sell the rumor by the
[828.56s] news when he actually got in bonds had a
[830.6s] meaningful rally in 2017 same thing with
[833.68s] the dollar as soon as he was elected it
[835.839s] had this knee-jerk strength all the way
[838.399s] into January into the inauguration and
[840.36s] then weakness and I think those are
[841.519s] going to be two big surprises in 2025
[845.399s] bonds get bid yields compressed dollar
[848.24s] actually re weakens maybe not the next
[850.6s] few weeks but as you look out six to
[852.44s] nine months that will be the case and if
[854.48s] you look at the inflation during the
[857.12s] Trump 1.0 Administration it was subdued
[859.8s] there were a lot of different conditions
[861.6s] I&#39;ll give you that history does not
[862.839s] repeat it does rhyme but the other thing
[865.48s] that was odd about uh uh 2017 to
[869.759s] 2020 is uh Emerging Markets did
[873.519s] exceptionally well when he was a pro
[876.0s] tariff the tarff king he ran on the
[878.0s] Tariff King and Emerging Markets had
[879.92s] really tremendous rallies as the dollar
[881.48s] weakened so I would be open-minded and
[883.839s] the other thing that people think energy
[885.32s] is going to do great energy did very
[886.959s] poorly under the Trump Administration
[889.639s] and so did retail stocks after initial
[891.92s] rally into the inauguration retail
[893.88s] stocks were very weak in that first year
[895.92s] probably on the fear of tariffs as well
[898.48s] so uh I would just be burdened by the
[901.079s] facts and the data versus the hearsay of
[903.8s] what might happen or perceptions about
[905.839s] what would happen look at what actually
[907.56s] happened and see where the conditions
[909.6s] are similar and where they might be
[910.959s] different and I think there&#39;s a
[912.079s] tremendous opportunities in the next 12
[913.72s] months in doing that Tomas Hayes great
[915.68s] Hill Capital chairman and managing
[917.24s] member always good to see you appreciate
[918.8s] the pics appreciate the puppy suggestion
[920.399s] we&#39;ll talk to you soon thanks so much
[922.36s] Brian thanks J all right now time for
[924.04s] some in a second and we&#39;re back all
[927.32s] right so that gives you kind of brief
[929.079s] context let&#39;s go to our quotes of the
[930.639s] week Benjamin Graham individuals who
[932.8s] cannot Master their emotions are ill
[934.759s] suited to profit from the investment
[937.079s] process look at Market fluctuations as
[939.839s] your friend rather than your enemy
[941.519s] profit from Folly rather than
[943.0s] participated that&#39;s from Warren Buffett
[944.48s] we&#39;re going to talk about some of that
[945.56s] Folly today Peter Lynch everyone has the
[948.8s] brain power to make money in stocks not
[950.759s] everyone has the stomach if you are
[952.6s] susceptible to selling everything in a
[954.519s] panic you ought to avoid stocks and
[956.399s] mutual funds all together you know it&#39;s
[958.319s] funny I was talking to a friend of mine
[961.959s] who um about
[965.279s] paler and and I was like look you know
[968.24s] that that&#39;s just out of my Lane uh you
[970.519s] know I buy high quality businesses when
[971.92s] they&#39;re on sale look for doubles over
[973.68s] two three years some of them are
[975.88s] multi-baggers but predictable stuff I
[978.12s] can lean into put in size sleep well at
[980.48s] night and not have to predict the future
[982.319s] and he&#39;s like yeah he&#39;s like what you do
[984.0s] is uh basically private equity in public
[988.079s] companies and
[990.04s] that&#39;s a brilliant way to think about it
[991.68s] I know that&#39;s effectively what I do but
[995.6s] um he stated it so succinctly that it
[997.759s] made a whole lot of sense uh and it&#39;s a
[999.6s] unique way that we do it and um and
[1002.639s] that&#39;s what I love and I&#39;ll always stay
[1003.8s] in my lane and um and what&#39;s beautiful
[1007.6s] about it is that and that&#39;s why I always
[1010.72s] talk to new clients you got to take a 36
[1012.72s] month view uh we don&#39;t have lockups
[1015.639s] because what happens is when the gains
[1018.0s] come they come at once and you&#39;ll have
[1020.44s] years where you know you&#39;re down five
[1023.88s] points against The Benchmark and then
[1025.439s] the next year you were up monstrous you
[1027.64s] know tens and tens and tens of
[1029.72s] percentages better off uh and um and and
[1033.52s] you look at the different
[1035.72s] setups um of the companies you&#39;re
[1038.679s] involved in relative to the intrinsic
[1040.48s] value and you are certain of the outcome
[1044.16s] you just can&#39;t know the timing but you
[1047.0s] but when you&#39;re you have the certainty
[1048.199s] of the outcome the only thing that gets
[1049.919s] adjusted is the irr uh and um and you
[1054.36s] manage around that so here are some of
[1056.919s] the indicators that I wanted to cover
[1058.28s] for this week just you know look the
[1060.08s] market certainly feels a little
[1062.76s] frothy we&#39;re going to go into some of
[1064.72s] the
[1065.52s] seasonality I would say this there are
[1069.76s] groups of stocks that are due for a
[1071.6s] pullback and there are groups of stocks
[1073.32s] that are due for a rally and I&#39;m going
[1076.679s] to remind you of what happened in Trump
[1080.0s] 1.0 and there was a huge difference
[1082.44s] between what happened between the
[1084.36s] election and the inauguration and what
[1086.28s] happened after the
[1087.72s] inauguration and if you can just
[1091.559s] um like Buffett
[1098.28s] said look at fluctuations as your friend
[1100.88s] rather than your enemy for instance
[1102.36s] today gxo Logistics uh that thing had
[1105.799s] traded up you know we were talking about
[1107.799s] it in the low 50s and high 40s on this
[1110.48s] uh podcast for a while and then it just
[1113.08s] shot up to the low 60s on rumors that
[1118.84s] the company was going to get bought out
[1121.24s] at whatever 25% premium and everyone was
[1123.84s] so excited I said that&#39;s the worst thing
[1125.24s] that could ever happen to us as
[1126.52s] investors I didn&#39;t get into this to make
[1129.08s] 10 or 20 or $30 which would be you know
[1131.919s] $30 if they got it they probably would
[1133.919s] have taken it at 80 uh which would have
[1136.28s] been a 60% gain which would have meant
[1138.159s] we had to pay pay ordinary income taxes
[1141.32s] on a gain much lower than our expected
[1143.32s] value of the business over the next 3
[1144.84s] years and uh and I voic my concern uh to
[1148.2s] the company I said look if you&#39;re not
[1149.919s] getting 80 this is a dumb deal and I&#39;m
[1152.4s] really surprised that it would even be
[1154.44s] considered uh and I don&#39;t know what they
[1156.28s] were offered or not offered but um uh
[1159.88s] you know I got into this for a minimum
[1161.72s] of a double over three years and I think
[1163.88s] the quality of the business and the
[1165.44s] oligopolistic nature of the business uh
[1168.559s] is is such that um it would have been a
[1173.36s] shame if they sold it for anything less
[1175.559s] than 80 and it would have been a shame
[1177.4s] if they sold it for 80 because I I think
[1179.0s] not only can it be a double over three
[1180.76s] years because everything is inflecting
[1183.799s] uh in the right direction for that
[1185.36s] business and it has the oligopolistic
[1187.28s] characteristics and it&#39;s very sticky and
[1189.039s] they control the client and all the
[1190.64s] other reasons that we&#39;ve got into gxo
[1192.679s] over the over the uh uh different
[1196.36s] podcasts um
[1201.88s] but I think it can go a lot higher than
[1203.48s] that because I don&#39;t think anyone&#39;s
[1204.799s] going to be able to compete with them
[1206.4s] once they get a client whether it&#39;s
[1208.24s] Coca-Cola whether it&#39;s Nike they lock
[1209.84s] them in forever and then they get more
[1211.24s] and more of their business uh and it&#39;s a
[1213.559s] business that I want to own probably for
[1215.4s] a very long time plus all the UK
[1217.2s] business I want a play on the recovery
[1219.64s] in the UK I want a play on an on a
[1222.72s] appreciating pound relative to the
[1224.88s] dollar I know everyone thinks the dollar
[1226.2s] is going to keep going up because of
[1227.36s] trump they thought the same thing in
[1228.679s] 2016 the exact opposite is going to
[1230.52s] happen we&#39;re going to cover that um so
[1234.32s] uh as much as I am excited to be a
[1237.76s] partner with any of Brad Jacobs
[1240.0s] Enterprises and we own a position in qxo
[1243.6s] and we own a position uh in gxo uh a big
[1248.12s] position which got a lot bigger this
[1251.32s] morning so um I&#39;m pretty excited about
[1254.559s] that I usually don&#39;t buy on the first
[1255.799s] day down I&#39;ll probably be be able to top
[1257.88s] up a little more than next few days but
[1260.4s] um I&#39;m super excited that they didn&#39;t
[1263.6s] sell it and I&#39;m more excited that I was
[1266.2s] able to get more people more positioning
[1268.36s] uh where available uh across the
[1270.64s] accounts today and take advantage of
[1273.919s] that opportunity and that&#39;s what we talk
[1276.08s] about looking at the market fluctuations
[1278.159s] as your friend rather than your enemy
[1279.84s] more people probably sold it uh because
[1282.6s] all the people were in for hot money to
[1284.039s] make five bucks on a deal and they got
[1286.24s] smoked which I&#39;m super happy about uh we
[1288.919s] don&#39;t need those own type of owners in
[1290.679s] the business and mastering the emotions
[1293.4s] who would buy a stock that gets pounded
[1295.08s] in a day other than turnaround Tom uh
[1299.36s] and in some accounts we were actually
[1302.039s] able to some we we were able to pick up
[1304.2s] some shares in the uh below 51 today uh
[1309.64s] in which case in some accounts we
[1311.12s] brought down the basis which was pretty
[1313.52s] excited and uh and some below 52 some
[1317.36s] below 51
[1319.12s] uh but look anything below 100 I think
[1322.12s] in this stock over the next three years
[1323.679s] is going to be a bargain so excited
[1325.559s] about that um here are some of the
[1329.159s] indicators so yeah we&#39;re stretched but
[1332.039s] you know you look at the extremes we&#39;re
[1334.039s] not really at the extremes before a
[1337.279s] crash we are at levels of enthusiasm you
[1341.559s] see during bull markets and honestly we
[1344.4s] haven&#39;t had a protracted one for some
[1347.32s] time uh and people just simply are too
[1349.96s] skeptical I mean look at materials in
[1352.12s] healthc care which we&#39;re going to talk a
[1353.24s] little bit about today number one
[1355.12s] biotech we&#39;ve owned we talked about we
[1357.4s] love that that&#39;s going to be huge in
[1360.279s] 2025 uh and uh healthc
[1364.08s] care uh materials albam Marl we&#39;re going
[1367.2s] to talk about today that was down today
[1369.159s] it&#39;s funny in my article I wrote you
[1371.12s] know it wasn&#39;t as big of a position as
[1373.48s] we would like because when we were
[1375.799s] putting it on several months ago and we
[1378.08s] talked about on the podcast uh one there
[1381.679s] was a limit where we had capacity we
[1383.44s] were pretty fully invested um and then
[1386.559s] by the time new money came
[1388.4s] in uh the stock had run away I mean it
[1390.919s] ran up like 20% in was it
[1395.12s] 20 yeah it was it was a pretty big move
[1398.12s] 10 what was it 93 to 108 so yeah it was
[1403.32s] over 10 12 13% move in a very short
[1406.159s] period of time and we don&#39;t buy up uh
[1408.159s] look at Dow intermediate term breath
[1410.039s] momentum you know that&#39;s generally you
[1412.44s] don&#39;t see that at tops you see it close
[1415.32s] to Bottoms which is kind of strange
[1417.0s] considering same with this intermediate
[1418.919s] term volume momentum and NASDAQ uh S&amp;P
[1422.44s] mlen summation
[1425.36s] index maybe you know maybe we get a
[1428.08s] pullback seasonally in the beginning of
[1430.0s] December you should get a little
[1431.159s] pullback into the 11th we&#39;re going to
[1433.159s] talk about Jeff hs&#39;s amazing work from
[1435.44s] uh going back to his dad Yale hirs who
[1437.64s] started the stock Traders
[1441.12s] Almanac today but look I see what
[1444.679s] everyone sees I see the Euphoria I see
[1447.88s] the kind of a little bit of frothiness I
[1450.039s] see some of these speculative
[1452.2s] instruments really really moving up a
[1454.12s] lot those are not great signs but I also
[1457.48s] see high quality businesses that have
[1459.24s] yet to get off the mat that are going to
[1460.88s] absolutely explode so I think you know
[1464.12s] would I be putting a lot of money in a
[1466.039s] non in a cap weighted Index right now no
[1469.52s] um we don&#39;t do indexes period but
[1473.399s] um an equal weighted index I think you
[1476.0s] could get away with even at even at
[1477.679s] these levels but on a stock bystock
[1480.039s] basis I could put 100% of new money to
[1483.919s] work today there&#39;s that much opportunity
[1486.399s] still created from the once in a 100y
[1488.6s] year event uh which is really really
[1492.6s] exciting uh bullish percent S&amp;P again
[1496.6s] you know these things are not scream
[1498.64s] like get the hell out they&#39;re screaming
[1501.0s] like it&#39;s getting it&#39;s starting to get
[1504.36s] frothy but I I just don&#39;t think people
[1506.36s] are going to take the tax bill until
[1508.76s] after January and my if if the
[1511.76s] cyclicality and the history for the last
[1513.96s] 100 years is right it probably holds up
[1516.44s] until the inauguration and then you get
[1518.399s] you know four to six months of sideways
[1520.44s] to down is really to consolidate until
[1522.559s] the market gets its footing big end of
[1525.2s] the year next year for a 8 to 12% index
[1528.48s] market for a fortune under the surface
[1530.799s] Market individual names uh and then the
[1533.6s] midterm second term midterm tends to be
[1536.159s] a less awesome than the first year of of
[1539.919s] a new term so we&#39;ll we&#39;ll see we&#39;ll take
[1541.919s] it as it comes as we see the data but
[1544.279s] even this NYSC mlen summation index
[1547.08s] again not what you see really at top so
[1550.32s] like as much as I want to buy like uh
[1553.24s] people are too excited and we&#39;re at the
[1555.12s] top I see all the things that everyone&#39;s
[1557.08s] talking about but the fact that
[1558.32s] everyone&#39;s talking about it tells me
[1560.159s] that the pain trade is probably to push
[1561.679s] a little higher because a lot of people
[1563.799s] have missed all of this you know we were
[1565.64s] one of the lone voices in the woods in
[1569.32s] Fall of 2022 pounding the hell out of
[1571.679s] the table to buy byy byy once in a
[1574.12s] lifetime and uh you know you had Tom Lee
[1577.399s] you had Ryan Dietrich you had Tom Hayes
[1579.84s] that was it and then you had the other
[1581.559s] side of the trade these guys calling for
[1583.12s] triple break putts and selling the hole
[1585.52s] I mean guys running hundreds of billions
[1587.76s] of dollars telling you to sell in the
[1589.12s] hole in Fall of 2022 and then again in
[1591.84s] March of 2023 and over and over and over
[1595.399s] so uh this one concerns me the skew is
[1599.76s] has re-elevated like that um but you can
[1604.679s] see in Long longer bull runs like
[1607.679s] 2013 14 15 it kept refreshing and
[1611.159s] refreshing same thing with 20168
[1613.76s] refreshing refreshing we&#39;ve refreshed
[1616.52s] twice again I think I think this goes
[1620.08s] through the inauguration that&#39;s not
[1621.76s] going to say it&#39;s going to be up another
[1623.08s] 5% it&#39;s just going to say I don&#39;t think
[1625.48s] it&#39;s going to crash the way some people
[1627.36s] are calling for number one uh and number
[1630.96s] two I don&#39;t think it&#39;s going to be
[1632.88s] before the end of the year I think
[1634.24s] you&#39;ll probably get a little wobbliness
[1636.08s] in this next week or so but you&#39;re going
[1638.48s] to finish up uh and uh and that&#39;s kind
[1641.76s] of my story in sticking too wanted to go
[1644.039s] back to the Trump trade 2016 because
[1645.919s] you&#39;re going to see a lot of things are
[1648.399s] kind of acting similarly so you saw big
[1651.44s] move in small caps and then it
[1653.52s] moderated uh I think this keeps going up
[1656.559s] small caps okay this was the big thing
[1659.6s] not not the big thing Arc we talked
[1661.24s] about a few weeks ago we said watch out
[1663.36s] she&#39;s going to be like a phoenix From
[1664.72s] the
[1665.72s] Ashes was weak after the election in
[1668.24s] 2016 took off
[1670.679s] 2017 and she starting to take off Baba
[1673.559s] what did it do after Trump got elected
[1675.24s] in 16 kept selling down which is what
[1677.72s] it&#39;s been doing before the inauguration
[1681.24s] on January 1 as soon as the calendar
[1683.679s] year turned and the tax loss selling was
[1685.76s] done went straight up and never looked
[1687.679s] back from $84 to $187 in 11 months uh I
[1692.84s] think we could see a similar repeat of
[1695.0s] that and I think that&#39;s going to be one
[1697.559s] of the most shocking trades for 2025 the
[1700.48s] other shocking trade is that bonds are
[1702.0s] going to get bid let&#39;s we&#39;ll show you
[1703.76s] some of these other things momentum
[1705.159s] stocks did did well uh um small caps we
[1709.519s] covered China stock same thing as Baba
[1712.519s] traded all the way down after Trump got
[1714.44s] elected right before he got inaugurated
[1716.32s] straight up and never looked back double
[1718.64s] in uh 11 months and that&#39;s an index by
[1722.08s] the way equal weighted did
[1724.08s] fine uh semiconductors did
[1727.72s] fine uh S&amp;P 500 just ground higher so I
[1732.32s] mean you look at this situation strong
[1735.24s] after the election with Trump then a
[1737.399s] little grind iness in December and
[1739.6s] January and February and then it just
[1741.72s] kept pushing higher we&#39;ll see we&#39;ll see
[1744.279s] on that on the indices uh
[1747.159s] solar again you know sold off after
[1750.64s] Trump got elected after the inauguration
[1753.559s] again choppy for a few months and then
[1755.12s] started to take back off I think solar
[1756.72s] is going to do a lot better under Trump
[1758.08s] than it did under Biden which is
[1759.84s] counterintuitive uh biotech same story a
[1762.6s] little weakness after the election a lot
[1764.76s] of strength uh after the inauguration
[1768.6s] um
[1770.44s] servicers uh were weak everyone thinks
[1772.96s] they&#39;re going to be strong on Trump I&#39;m
[1775.0s] still going to hold my comso resources I
[1777.36s] mean unless the thing went to like 40
[1779.519s] and two minutes I I I&#39;m going to hold
[1781.48s] that one for the long term materials
[1783.72s] same thing we want more materials
[1785.399s] exposure we&#39;ll talk about Alam Maro on
[1787.44s] that today and uh hopefully we get
[1789.6s] another few bad days on Alam Maro so we
[1791.679s] can make it a real position but um uh
[1794.399s] Today Was a Good Start uh XLE same thing
[1798.48s] people think it&#39;ll be strong probably
[1800.0s] won&#39;t be as strong as people think
[1801.32s] certainly in that first year financials
[1803.679s] they&#39;ve moved up a lot I think they&#39;re
[1805.24s] going to be more sideways than up in the
[1807.44s] short term and probably second half when
[1809.159s] that IPO machine uh cranks will be
[1812.519s] better um industrial same story Tech
[1817.48s] little bumpy then ground higher they&#39;ll
[1819.519s] be fine uh Staples we&#39;re going to find
[1822.32s] some opportunities probably in the next
[1823.679s] few weeks to get some Staples exposure
[1826.2s] utility same story down after Trump was
[1828.679s] elected why because bonds spiked and
[1831.96s] then um same thing with Healthcare I
[1834.76s] think healthcare is going to be the
[1835.64s] opportunity of a lifetime got smoked
[1837.88s] after he got elected ripped higher after
[1840.799s] the
[1841.6s] inauguration consumer
[1843.72s] discretionary uh exploration production
[1846.08s] spiked after elected collapsed after
[1848.76s] inaugurated uh retail same story spiked
[1851.48s] after elected collapse after inaugurated
[1853.84s] it it it&#39;s not necessarily going to
[1856.76s] repeat but it is going to rhyme but the
[1859.559s] most important one which I don&#39;t know
[1861.679s] why was not in there is
[1868.639s] TLT okay
[1871.48s] so sold off big which means yields went
[1875.0s] up after Trump was elected we had the
[1878.36s] same thing now and then slightly before
[1881.039s] the inauguration and then a little
[1882.72s] choppiness after but the whole following
[1884.88s] year bonds got bid yields compressed I
[1886.919s] think that&#39;s going to be the biggest
[1888.12s] surprise the other thing that&#39;s going to
[1889.88s] be a big surprise the two biggest
[1891.44s] surprises are yields down and US dollar
[1895.96s] down look what happened after Trump got
[1898.24s] elected in
[1899.32s] 2016 rallied like crazy into January 1
[1903.559s] and then collapsed his whole first year
[1905.12s] of the presidency expect that and what
[1907.639s] does that do it sends China Emerging
[1910.88s] Markets through the roof Emerging
[1913.84s] Markets as the dollar spiked after the
[1915.639s] election Emerging Markets fell peaked at
[1918.88s] on Jan one and rolled over Emerging
[1921.6s] Markets Off to the Races um so that&#39;s
[1925.2s] that all right let&#39;s go through our
[1928.48s] data materials again is
[1933.12s] this oh okay let&#39;s get to the top
[1937.48s] here okay this was a quote from one of
[1940.039s] Warren Buffett&#39;s letters that I was
[1941.6s] reading through and I thought it was
[1944.559s] appropriate to talk about today he said
[1947.44s] we select our marketable Equity
[1949.679s] Securities in much the same way we would
[1952.24s] evaluate a business for acquisition in
[1954.72s] its entirety we want the business to be
[1957.519s] number one one that we can understand
[1959.679s] number two with favorable long-term
[1962.32s] prospects and number three uh operated
[1965.12s] by honest and competent people and
[1967.32s] finally four available at a very
[1969.96s] attractive price and most people
[1972.12s] continue to forget number four price is
[1974.399s] what you pay value is what you get you
[1976.679s] know you can get distracted ra raed by
[1978.44s] seeing the shiny objects and all the
[1980.559s] yahoos chasing the winners and they look
[1983.12s] great in the short term and then when
[1985.6s] they get smoked and the company the Momo
[1988.519s] company hits a misses a quarter and the
[1991.32s] stock&#39;s down 40% in a matter of days uh
[1994.559s] you just don&#39;t hear from them for three
[1996.0s] months they disappear some never come
[1997.72s] back most never come back some come back
[2000.2s] and they act like it never happened and
[2001.799s] eventually people forget but um that&#39;s
[2005.919s] not what we do so uh
[2008.48s] um you know to my friend&#39;s point it&#39;s
[2012.96s] basically like Buffett&#39;s talking about
[2014.76s] here what would we be willing to pay for
[2017.0s] the entire business and feel like we got
[2019.039s] a deal uh we ordinarily make no attempt
[2021.88s] to buy equities for anticipated
[2023.76s] favorable stock price behavior in the
[2025.679s] short term in fact if their business&#39;s
[2028.519s] experience if their business experience
[2030.639s] continues to satisfy us we welcome lower
[2033.6s] market prices of stocks we own as an
[2035.919s] opportunity to acquire even more of a
[2038.399s] good thing at a better price and that&#39;s
[2042.2s] what we do every single week and you
[2044.559s] know for those companies that take off
[2046.24s] faster than we want we&#39;re often
[2048.52s] disappointed that we didn&#39;t get an
[2050.159s] opportunity to size into it uh because
[2052.839s] it ran away from us than enthusiastic
[2056.0s] that it got to our intrinsic value
[2058.119s] faster than than we wanted it to uh what
[2060.919s] Buffett&#39;s saying here is our experience
[2062.599s] has been that prata portions of truly
[2065.04s] outstanding businesses sometimes sell in
[2066.839s] the Securities Market markets at very
[2069.04s] large discounts from the prices they
[2070.76s] would command in negotiated transactions
[2073.919s] involving the entire companies
[2076.0s] consequently Bargains and business
[2077.679s] ownership which simply are not available
[2080.44s] directly through corporate acquisition
[2082.119s] can be obtained indirectly through stock
[2084.28s] ownership when prices are appropriate we
[2087.76s] are willing to take very large positions
[2090.24s] in selected companies not with any
[2092.879s] intention of taking control and not
[2094.8s] foreseeing sellout or merger but with
[2097.119s] the expectation that excellent business
[2099.16s] results by corporations will translate
[2101.28s] over the long term into correspondingly
[2104.16s] excellent market value and dividend
[2106.16s] results for our owners minority as well
[2108.8s] as
[2110.119s] majority today&#39;s a perfect example with
[2112.88s] gxo Logistics and even albam Maro and
[2115.8s] even Intel by the way although you can
[2117.88s] argue Intel is not a great business I
[2120.04s] beg to differ and we&#39;ll explain a little
[2121.52s] bit reasons why uh today but
[2125.96s] um uh gxo you had all these people
[2128.56s] bidding it up at you know from 48 to 63
[2131.92s] thinking they were going to deal get a
[2133.079s] deal at 65 or 70 and I was surprised
[2137.079s] that that management even entertained a
[2139.119s] deal because they have such a unique
[2141.119s] position in that market and such an
[2144.72s] oligopolistic uh situation with DHL
[2147.48s] basically duopolistic in a fragmented
[2149.599s] business they can roll up tons of more
[2152.16s] businesses uh and just control the thing
[2155.319s] and um
[2157.8s] uh so anyway I&#39;m glad they finally came
[2159.48s] to the right conclusion and I guess look
[2161.28s] at $80 or $90 they would have had to
[2162.96s] consider it I just don&#39;t think that was
[2164.44s] on the table and to even have a meeting
[2166.599s] over 60 you know one of the there are
[2169.76s] two primary criteria that turnaround Tom
[2173.28s] has when he&#39;s going into a business
[2175.4s] number one is if I were to get financed
[2178.599s] by JP Morgan to buy 100% of the
[2183.2s] company uh at these prices that are
[2186.56s] quoted in the public markets and I
[2188.4s] presented that to the board uh would the
[2191.72s] board ask security to remove me from the
[2194.839s] premises because they thought I was
[2196.92s] absolutely a Looney Tune and I&#39;m looking
[2199.96s] to buy great businesses at Looney Tune
[2202.8s] prices which the public markets Mr
[2205.4s] Market it&#39;s manic depressive if you read
[2208.16s] Benjamin Graham&#39;s intelligent investor
[2211.44s] uh serves these up and and if the board
[2214.0s] would not have me escorted off the
[2215.839s] premises because my order off was
[2217.96s] ridiculous I.E the price that it&#39;s
[2220.119s] quoted in the public markets uh then I&#39;m
[2223.119s] less interested uh and number
[2225.96s] two if this position goes to zero will
[2229.359s] they take me out on the on a stretcher
[2231.72s] and that has to also be no meaning it&#39;s
[2235.68s] not sized in a way that it has a
[2238.4s] terminal effect if there&#39;s something
[2240.2s] that I don&#39;t know that I don&#39;t know uh
[2243.16s] and usually the lower expected value
[2247.04s] return
[2248.079s] the higher the certainty and the ability
[2251.359s] to size up so if the expected value on
[2254.88s] an investment is a double over two to
[2257.319s] three to four years it&#39;s probably got a
[2260.119s] high degree of certainty business and
[2263.319s] it&#39;s uh low risk in terms of balance
[2266.04s] sheet in terms of cyclicality in terms
[2268.56s] of uh newness I have data through many
[2271.16s] many cycles I have confidence in
[2272.92s] management so I can make it big size
[2275.16s] with a relatively reasonable expect Ed
[2277.96s] return 30 plus%
[2280.079s] irr um uh maybe higher if it happens
[2284.079s] faster maybe a little lower but over a
[2285.8s] basket of 10 to 12 uh I can hit my
[2288.839s] targets
[2291.24s] um and uh and the ones that have the
[2294.64s] higher expected returns of 3x 5x 10x
[2299.119s] because they&#39;re so pounded and I&#39;m
[2300.52s] looking for some refinance Catalyst or
[2302.92s] some cyclical adjustment and a highly
[2305.44s] operating leveraged business
[2308.28s] uh then I have to size it accordingly
[2310.319s] you know that&#39;s not going to be a Max
[2312.56s] siiz position uh if there&#39;s a
[2315.16s] possibility because if you know if you
[2316.72s] get taken out on a 15% position it&#39;s you
[2319.52s] know it&#39;s going to take a a year to make
[2323.0s] that back from the other eight or 10
[2324.72s] positions so you don&#39;t ever want to be
[2326.04s] in that position uh so that&#39;s got to be
[2328.64s] sized down but if the expected value is
[2331.0s] eight or 10x uh even a five to six to 7%
[2335.119s] position is a material contributor over
[2337.119s] three or four years so that&#39;s kind of a
[2339.119s] little bit about how I think about it
[2340.48s] but it was interesting to see this
[2342.8s] explanation from Buffett that
[2344.76s] effectively embodies how I think about
[2347.2s] it and which I probably learned from him
[2349.48s] which I learned most of the things I
[2350.839s] learned from him um stocks tend to do
[2353.64s] well in the December of an election year
[2357.76s] this is from Ryan Dietrich over at
[2359.4s] Carson so 83% positivity rate 1.3%
[2363.56s] average gains December is historically
[2365.56s] solid month uh past 20 years up uh you
[2370.2s] know one in change an election year up
[2372.319s] even more since 1950 up even more so all
[2376.04s] these things point to a positive
[2377.4s] December don&#39;t bet against it average
[2379.96s] return after the Market&#39;s up 20% year-to
[2383.04s] date is
[2384.96s] 2.4% uh junk to treasury bond spreads no
[2388.52s] concerns of
[2390.76s] risk uh I would just say
[2394.92s] that you know you often
[2401.359s] when when volatility initially comes
[2403.64s] down this low and people present this as
[2405.56s] a reason to say watch out we&#39;re at the
[2408.52s] top you often have multiple bumps along
[2412.76s] the bottom before you get the next Spike
[2414.64s] I mean and this is a bad sample it&#39;s
[2416.56s] only 24 years but like even dot you had
[2419.4s] this crazy Spike like you had with covid
[2421.8s] but then you get this one roll over
[2423.56s] again and that&#39;s kind of halfway through
[2425.48s] the rally just like we got this one roll
[2427.599s] over about halfway through the rally and
[2430.2s] and you keep going you know here it went
[2432.52s] for four plus years here we about two
[2435.599s] years into
[2436.88s] it um same thing with uh 2011 you got
[2442.319s] this huge Spike during the financial
[2443.88s] crisis on the
[2446.2s] vix uh treasury bond spreads no concerns
[2449.16s] of risk then you get this uh After Shock
[2452.2s] in 2011 just like you got in 2022 which
[2455.04s] by the way it&#39;s funny in 2022 I a friend
[2457.88s] who was saying that&#39;s it look at credit
[2460.0s] spreads and I said that happens every
[2461.88s] cycle this is an Aftershock and I
[2463.44s] remember on the podcast talking about
[2465.079s] these and he went all to cash and you
[2467.24s] know he claims that he was buying it
[2469.079s] anyway it is what it is and um and then
[2473.319s] it rolled back over and then you still
[2475.119s] had multiple years and you had one more
[2477.48s] Spike so I think you probably have
[2479.2s] another one probably in the midterm
[2481.0s] election year if I had to guess and
[2482.96s] that&#39;s when I&#39;d start to get a little
[2484.04s] bit more cautious and and harvesting a
[2485.839s] lot of the things that were in all items
[2488.0s] Consumer Price Index 12- month change so
[2490.24s] that&#39;s been oh this is interesting so
[2492.88s] this is from
[2494.28s] 1914 to 1929 ladies and gentlemen which
[2497.92s] is the Once in a 100y year event the
[2499.839s] Spanish Flu 1917 1918 you had this huge
[2503.4s] spike in inflation two years later it
[2506.76s] collapsed like we&#39;ve been seeing the
[2508.599s] last uh 12 months uh Rose a little bit
[2512.04s] and then just stayed level all the way
[2514.8s] through 1929 and I think this is kind of
[2516.88s] the base case it&#39;ll be a little more
[2518.72s] elevated from here and it&#39;ll probably
[2520.68s] stay that way uh till the end of the the
[2525.92s] decade and um and the other interesting
[2529.28s] thing about these comparisons like the
[2531.88s] Roaring 20s and I talk a lot about it on
[2533.72s] the podcast is you had the same type of
[2537.16s] demographic benefit where you had a
[2540.079s] large segment of the population at
[2541.88s] housing formation years in the 20s so
[2544.52s] some people think it was because the
[2545.76s] Spanish flu and the aftermarket the
[2547.4s] roaring 20 some think it was because of
[2549.119s] the automobile but I think demographics
[2551.8s] also had a lot to do with it very
[2553.52s] similar to uh what we&#39;re seeing now and
[2556.8s] if you look at like
[2558.68s] 1910
[2560.24s] through uh 1930 again like another 18 to
[2564.48s] 20 year secular bull you had that young
[2566.88s] population so we were about halfway
[2570.04s] through I think we&#39;re about you know a
[2572.04s] little bit more than halfway through
[2573.72s] here if you consider
[2576.119s] probably since 2009 so probably at least
[2579.319s] another 6 seven8 years in this bull run
[2583.0s] and that&#39;s what it&#39;s going to look like
[2584.119s] the last 6 seven8 years in terms of
[2586.2s] inflation a little elevated and that&#39;ll
[2587.72s] bring down debt to GDP like we saw post
[2590.319s] World War II December rarely is the
[2592.72s] worst month of the
[2594.96s] year uh this is from Seth
[2597.92s] golden I&#39;ve not seen retail rail traffic
[2601.28s] data this ridiculous head strong in
[2602.96s] recession slowdown ever
[2607.4s] uh so he&#39;s yeah he&#39;s basically talking
[2609.559s] about what we&#39;ve been talking about for
[2610.839s] several months which is very hard to
[2612.359s] have a recession when you have rail
[2613.48s] traffic that strong corporate insiders
[2616.88s] are stock sales reach all-time high this
[2619.72s] is another thing people are pointing to
[2621.839s] to say the rally is over uh I think the
[2624.559s] smart way to look at this is
[2627.92s] that corporate insiders are often very
[2632.24s] early uh you know if you look here they
[2635.72s] were three years early selling at this
[2637.68s] level in 2004 that often happens because
[2641.0s] they&#39;re stuck in recency bias like they
[2642.88s] remember three years ago how bad things
[2644.559s] were this is like their way to get out
[2646.839s] at you know pre-pandemic levels or
[2648.599s] whatever it happens to be uh and I think
[2650.72s] they&#39;re going to be early this time as
[2652.88s] well not all companies some are going to
[2654.839s] be right uh maybe Jensen will be right
[2657.28s] selling a billion dollars a stock on the
[2659.0s] retail investors but uh the rest of them
[2662.2s] uh were way too early
[2664.16s] 2012
[2665.839s] 2003 uh and it just keeps going
[2669.24s] 2016 etc
[2671.44s] etc uh JD Power November new vehicle
[2675.68s] sales expected to Surge to 16.5 million
[2679.68s] SAR consumer spending to reach highest
[2682.28s] level ever for November that&#39;s from a
[2685.559s] few days
[2687.96s] ago
[2689.76s] um projected to reach 1.36 million a
[2694.04s] 6.7% increase from November 2023
[2697.92s] on a selling day adjusted basis that&#39;s a
[2700.52s] forecast from JD
[2702.64s] Power and the seasonally adjusted
[2705.599s] annualized rate for total new vehicle
[2708.319s] sales is expected to be
[2711.0s] 16.5 million ladies and gentlemen if we
[2715.04s] get
[2717.119s] 16.5 for a
[2720.96s] year I think Cooper standard could earn
[2729.44s] potentially at
[2731.28s] 16.5 more than it earned in
[2735.44s] 2017 on
[2737.839s] 17.1 meaning greater than seven bucks a
[2740.72s] share so put whatever multiple you want
[2742.64s] on it the worst multiple was 10 when
[2745.64s] they were making money the best multiple
[2747.559s] was 20 we love it uh and we don&#39;t have
[2752.04s] anything else to say about it 6,000 is
[2755.24s] here now what this is from trick 12
[2757.68s] months later after major Milestones
[2760.359s] average up 88.6% I think that makes a
[2763.04s] lot of sense I think that would be the
[2764.52s] right number for 2024 for the S&amp;P to be
[2767.28s] up 8.6 it wouldn&#39;t surprise me if it was
[2769.559s] up 12.6 wouldn&#39;t surprise me if it was
[2772.04s] up 7.6 it would surprise me if it was up
[2774.359s] 19.6 I&#39;ll leave it at that monthly
[2777.04s] return stats for the S&amp;P 500 and by the
[2779.4s] way that&#39;s the that is the type of
[2782.0s] environment where we mint money uh
[2785.4s] monthly return stats for S&amp;P 500s 1964
[2790.0s] to
[2792.52s] 2023 December had the highest positivity

[2831.599s] about it that&#39;s fine they will after

[2909.839s] extreme great financial crisis pushed
[2913.079s] stock allocations below the traditional

[2917.64s] about households rushing into stocks
[2920.04s] they&#39;re still not nearing anywhere
[2922.839s] near um certainly not the tech highs and
[2926.319s] certainly not the pre-financial crisis
[2928.24s] highs we&#39;re still stock at
[2931.68s] 57% and the mean is probably around 59
[2935.24s] to 60% and Peaks were 71% so putting it
[2939.799s] in perspective bull bear indicator at

[2945.839s] acute top Bank of America projects near

[2962.119s] see all right confidence surges among
[2964.44s] small business owners so I don&#39;t have to
[2965.96s] go after that let let&#39;s see what the
[2967.559s] coin flip odds are after Powell spoke
[2969.799s] today for
[2972.079s] December uh very interesting the odds
[2975.2s] shot up today for
[2977.839s] 78% chance of a cut in December if he
[2981.44s] does
[2982.48s] that I think he can be done for a while
[2986.119s] I think that would be the right move I
[2988.96s] think that he could potentially do
[2991.079s] nothing until at least March and then
[2994.04s] maybe from there
[2997.2s] two more cuts and done if that take it
[3000.839s] down to four maybe Max
[3004.24s] 375 uh and that&#39;s all he&#39;s going to
[3006.799s] need biggest underperformance of Europe
[3009.68s] versus the us since
[3011.88s] 1976 what happened next biggest
[3014.319s] outperformance of Europe versus the US
[3016.599s] this is no different
[3018.44s] than
[3020.0s] um Emerging Markets the same thing you
[3022.559s] are going to see this inflect and what&#39;s
[3025.16s] going to be the catalyst is the same
[3027.119s] thing you saw in the 70s and the same
[3028.839s] thing you saw in the periods where it
[3030.079s] outperformed is that the terminal rate
[3032.599s] is much higher than the previous cycle
[3035.52s] and with a terminal rate at 375 or four
[3040.04s] uh value and xus outperform and we&#39;re
[3044.599s] going to see the same thing this if you
[3046.44s] don&#39;t take this bet US Stocks very
[3049.44s] exceptional relative to European
[3050.92s] equities uh some probably four standard
[3054.28s] deviations above the mean
[3057.48s] uh then you just you know God bless you
[3060.88s] I mean uh
[3065.24s] but I don&#39;t know how to put this I
[3069.839s] mean it&#39;s not saying bet 100% on this
[3073.48s] but if you see an extreme like this and
[3075.92s] you don&#39;t take five or 10 or 15% of your
[3078.92s] portfolio and expose yourself somehow to
[3081.68s] the reversion of the mean instead you
[3083.16s] chase four standard deviations up uh
[3086.04s] number one you&#39;re begging for a reaming
[3088.28s] and number two uh you&#39;re missing a
[3092.079s] generational opportunity to make obscene
[3093.96s] amounts of money in a short period of
[3095.319s] time and look you can be wrong if you&#39;re
[3098.28s] on margin is where you&#39;ll get hurt if
[3101.68s] you&#39;re not on margin and it takes three
[3104.24s] years longer than you expect to make 10x
[3107.599s] on that 10% of your portfolio or 15% of
[3111.079s] your
[3112.0s] portfolio uh it doesn&#39;t matter the irr
[3116.0s] is so insane relative to everything else
[3118.88s] you have to take that bet and if you&#39;re
[3121.28s] wrong probably all that happens is that
[3123.799s] was dead money in your portfolio you
[3125.92s] didn&#39;t lose because you&#39;re buying at
[3127.359s] such a discount to intrinsic value uh
[3129.96s] you just didn&#39;t win so you&#39;d have a one
[3131.599s] or 200 basis points drag on your over
[3134.4s] overall portfolio but you might have a
[3138.319s] 150% accretion from that 10% if you did
[3142.4s] take the bet so those asymmetric bets
[3146.24s] and I learned that from my years at
[3148.52s] Cornwall Capital if you watch the movie
[3150.48s] The Big Short they were masters of
[3153.04s] asymmetric bets and I learned a lot from
[3155.559s] listening to them and that&#39;s by the way
[3157.04s] how I got my foot in the door I gave
[3158.559s] them a short soybeans trade they made 5x
[3161.119s] in 90 days uh 25 million bucks on a $5
[3164.16s] million investment on puts in summer of
[3169.079s] 2012 uh and um and that&#39;s that so so
[3173.72s] this is one of those examples of
[3175.2s] asymmetry yes I know growth is going to
[3177.16s] be slower yes I know all that but the
[3179.079s] difference is lagard will probably go
[3180.599s] down to 1% terminal rate we&#39;re going
[3182.28s] down to 4% terminal rate and she&#39;ll
[3184.48s] Juice It Up so I&#39;m not saying bet on
[3186.599s] Europe I&#39;m saying bet on Emerging
[3188.64s] Markets but you can find some
[3190.4s] opportunities there and we we&#39;re making
[3191.799s] an implicit European bet with gxo for
[3194.64s] sure India stock funds see largest
[3197.28s] four-week outflow since June 2022
[3200.68s] couldn&#39;t get enough here now it&#39;s
[3202.24s] rolling over they&#39;re all getting out and
[3204.52s] that&#39;s going to persist for many years
[3205.92s] in our vle China discount or India
[3208.28s] premium India premium in my view forward
[3210.64s] PE in China
[3212.68s] 9.8 times forward PE in India
[3235.44s] 22.58% perform but if you go back a
[3238.24s] little further China has had periods of
[3240.16s] outperformance and this is going to
[3241.64s] revert back and if you don&#39;t understand
[3243.28s] reversion to the mean 100% wrong
[3246.119s] business for you in my view um I look
[3250.44s] I&#39;ve been in this business long enough
[3252.48s] to watch the Momo guys come in get
[3255.839s] decapitated uh some rise rise from the
[3258.599s] dead uh and get another shot like Kathy
[3261.04s] Woods got smoked uh in the um Tech W in
[3264.68s] 2000 she came back built a monster
[3267.16s] business got smoked again but she&#39;s a
[3269.16s] Survivor and by the way I think she&#39;s
[3271.0s] gonna have an enormous run the next
[3272.44s] three to five years so kudos to her uh
[3275.4s] in some sense and um but very few of the
[3279.079s] Momo Chasers uh uh get get to chapter
[3282.72s] two they they chase up they get smoked
[3285.48s] out and they find another career um
[3288.52s] whereas the value the biggest risk of
[3290.44s] the value guys over time the ones that
[3293.0s] are good uh is that they go through
[3295.72s] periods of year or two of
[3297.599s] underperformance relative to the index
[3299.92s] and then the third year they make it all
[3301.4s] back in spades because they have a
[3302.559s] triple digit year and everyone&#39;s like oh
[3304.079s] my God the irr is 35% a year that&#39;s so
[3306.96s] amazing blah blah blah but it&#39;s it&#39;s not
[3308.96s] they&#39;re betting on sure things they&#39;re
[3310.599s] just playing the time Arbitrage game and
[3312.28s] the ones who are really good at it don&#39;t
[3314.16s] use uh meaningful leverage and over time
[3317.64s] they win and um that&#39;s probably my best
[3321.119s] advice to all the young people that are
[3323.44s] listening uh don&#39;t get lured into the
[3327.559s] shiny object game because it will lead
[3329.96s] to a short career um or if you do get
[3334.28s] caught up and make obscene amounts of
[3335.799s] money in a short period of time take
[3337.599s] your Chips off the table after your two
[3339.24s] free drinks and and leave the
[3341.559s] casino um Bank of America forecasting
[3344.92s] 124 rate cuts by central banks in 2025
[3348.88s] okay so if you&#39;re going to get 124
[3352.0s] cuts xus and three Cuts us where do you
[3356.319s] want to place your bets ladies and
[3357.319s] gentlemen where the 121 cuts are
[3359.52s] happening or where the three cuts are
[3360.799s] happening so again this is
[3365.96s] um stuff to pay attention to and in
[3369.24s] those periods where you had these
[3370.4s] massive Cuts you saw the benefits of xus
[3375.44s] Emerging Markets during those years you
[3377.16s] can go back and trace
[3380.64s] it um
[3389.52s] okay again from dri S&amp;P returns Final
[3392.839s] six months went up 10 okay we covered
[3395.359s] that December gains after 20%
[3399.24s] plus um have averaged you know you had
[3402.839s] 4.4 2.9 2.4 1.8 5.1 so what they&#39;re
[3406.559s] saying here is similar to what Tom Lee
[3408.0s] is saying like we could finish the year
[3409.28s] at
[3409.92s] 6,300 uh maybe that that could certainly
[3412.72s] be the case that would be an exciting
[3414.0s] way to end the year manufacturing
[3415.72s] Outlook brightens across several US
[3417.88s] regions we&#39;ve been talking about this
[3419.44s] theme you look at the uh different
[3421.359s] Regional manufacturing results we are
[3424.2s] coming out of the manufacturing
[3425.52s] recession and that&#39;s going to fuel the
[3427.64s] next phase of the bull market which has
[3430.16s] been in a depression manufacturing ISM
[3432.64s] Manufacturing turning up new orders
[3435.16s] turning up private construction turning
[3438.599s] up uh this is interesting ISM
[3441.16s] Manufacturing PMI has lagged cyclicals
[3445.44s] uh over defense and that&#39;s going to play
[3447.4s] Massive catchup on the uh
[3450.599s] pmis Japan corporate profits rolling
[3453.4s] over to negative again people couldn&#39;t
[3455.76s] get enough China and um excuse me people
[3458.599s] couldn&#39;t get enough India and Japan at
[3460.76s] the exact wrong time and sure enough
[3463.4s] rolling over Russell 2000 this actually
[3466.319s] broke out small caps broke out just
[3469.839s] beginning uh Global manufacturing PMI
[3472.48s] turning up from negative so that that
[3474.76s] points to X
[3477.0s] us uh biggest exporters interestingly
[3479.96s] enough uh China exports 3.4 trillion a
[3482.599s] year we only export two trillion a year
[3485.079s] Japan shockingly is only 700 billion and
[3488.319s] India is only 400 billion so uh South
[3491.88s] Korea is a big exporter that&#39;s why we
[3493.599s] watch them a lot um and so on it&#39;s good
[3497.039s] to see that in
[3498.4s] color uh S&amp;P index around election day
[3502.319s] you get this pop
[3504.16s] up then December early pullback whether
[3507.76s] we&#39;ve seen that already I don&#39;t know and
[3510.24s] then push
[3513.28s] up and then grind sideways so we&#39;ll see
[3517.24s] uh federal government spending you can
[3519.039s] see by category Social Security being
[3520.839s] the highest health care net interest
[3523.599s] this they&#39;re going to bring rates down
[3525.96s] Medicare National Defense income
[3528.44s] security veterans
[3529.839s] benefits so we&#39;ll see what VC and uh
[3534.52s] Elon can do over last four decades
[3537.319s] November through January has been the
[3539.039s] strongest period for the Russell 2000 I
[3541.44s] think that continues December&#39;s been the
[3543.2s] best month for small relative to large
[3545.4s] caps I think we&#39;re going to see a follow
[3547.4s] through on that despite today was led by
[3549.48s] Tech because CRM said the word Ai and
[3552.599s] their results and everyone got excited
[3555.319s] um and OCTA S&amp;P 500 monthly seasonality
[3559.039s] for all
[3561.64s] years so here&#39;s a color visual of what
[3564.319s] we talked about earlier
[3567.359s] December July April and January are all
[3571.72s] good months so you know I wouldn&#39;t get
[3573.64s] too an to sell until mid until the
[3576.72s] inauguration January 20th is generally
[3579.48s] where I&#39;d be looking second third fourth
[3581.64s] week uh for things that are super fully
[3584.92s] valued for things that are not valued
[3586.52s] forget this timing nonsense and
[3588.079s] seasonality nonsense you sell it when
[3590.24s] it&#39;s when it&#39;s met your targets which
[3592.4s] you should have discerned before you
[3593.68s] even got into the position every single
[3595.68s] position we know where we&#39;re getting out
[3597.559s] before we get in the only thing that
[3598.76s] changes that calculus is if the facts
[3601.559s] change and the fundamentals get better
[3603.24s] or worse than we anticipated where
[3604.92s] they&#39;d be three years out uh but we&#39;ve
[3607.24s] modeled it and we know where where we&#39;re
[3610.72s] going
[3612.76s] um and when we want to get there so uh
[3616.48s] manufacturing
[3618.319s] PMI oh this is interesting price
[3621.0s] indicator suggests deflationary
[3622.64s] pressures eased in November this is
[3624.44s] China went from negative to positive
[3626.559s] that&#39;s a big deal same thing with
[3627.88s] manufacturing PA PMI from contraction to
[3631.48s] expansion so all the things in the
[3633.16s] stimulus that people are impatient about
[3634.76s] are coming through would we like direct
[3636.319s] consumer stimulus yes they&#39;re going to
[3637.92s] have another big meeting expectations
[3639.92s] are so low because every big meeting
[3641.44s] they the bed maybe this time it&#39;ll
[3643.52s] be different because no one expects
[3644.88s] anything here&#39;s Jeffrey H who I was
[3646.92s] talking about the stock Traders
[3649.0s] Almanac you should buy one by the way if
[3651.2s] you don&#39;t have one teach you a lot about
[3652.96s] seasonality and historical data I think
[3654.96s] it&#39;s good to have
[3657.039s] um choppy first half of December before
[3660.92s] a yearend rally so basically you rise up
[3663.88s] a little bit on
[3665.64s] average um through the 10th then weak
[3671.079s] into the 13th 14th 15th and then the
[3673.72s] yearend rally called the Santa Claus
[3675.52s] rally last five seven days of the year
[3677.68s] job openings rise and more workers quit
[3679.72s] in sign of improving US Labor Market
[3684.599s] um so that&#39;s good that was a little bit
[3688.359s] worrisome and there was another fed
[3690.68s] speaker out earlier in the
[3692.68s] week who said the word skip which was a
[3696.039s] little concerning to me but it seems
[3698.079s] like Powell put the market at ease today
[3701.559s] with what he said and now we&#39;ve got the
[3703.599s] odds but that&#39;s kind of meaningless
[3705.76s] until we get the jobs number um the
[3709.92s] initial numbers pointed to a number
[3713.319s] that&#39;s going to be supportive of doing a
[3715.079s] cut in De December and I think that
[3716.92s] would just be really set the stage and
[3719.2s] after that if you&#39;re asking for a lot
[3721.279s] more Cuts after that you&#39;re kind of
[3722.52s] being greedy I think if they frontload
[3724.279s] them the way they&#39;ve been doing you know
[3727.119s] one is plenty wait three months see how
[3729.2s] the data comes
[3731.599s] in one or two next year and let the let
[3734.68s] the machine run Wards Automotive US Auto
[3738.0s] Sales SAR this is at 16.5 what&#39;s really
[3742.039s] interesting if you if you look at it
[3743.64s] from like a chared standpoint you can
[3746.119s] see here in
[3748.039s] 2017 and 18 it got 18 got up over 18
[3754.279s] million according to this
[3757.599s] data
[3760.64s] um well that okay that was a monthly but
[3764.0s] the annual came out at 17.1 Blended
[3766.359s] because you see they had some months at
[3767.64s] 16 then shot over 18 so 171 when they
[3770.68s] earned $719 a share so we just got a
[3774.0s] month above 165 this is amazing cuz like
[3777.92s] you know the chartist would say oh it
[3779.52s] finally broke out from this 2-year
[3781.359s] consolidation from 2023 to
[3784.039s] 2024 th this is really good news ladies
[3786.359s] and gentlemen so I&#39;m excited gxo
[3788.48s] Logistics this was a note out from steel
[3790.279s] thanks to my friends over there I know
[3791.48s] we&#39;ve got a lot of
[3793.039s] listeners um so gxo backs away from
[3796.44s] buyout talks and announces plan CEO
[3798.76s] retirement next year I thought last
[3800.559s] week&#39;s was going to be short it was like
[3802.16s] two hours by the way last week&#39;s was one
[3803.799s] of the better ones of the year uh this
[3806.359s] week&#39;s we&#39;ve got so much stuff to cover
[3808.359s] I I thought it was going to be a half
[3809.48s] hour call again um retirement next year
[3813.76s] fundamental thesis unchanged and what
[3816.2s] they
[3819.64s] do they talk about multiple on you know
[3823.079s] 950 of adjusted eida for
[3826.96s] 2025
[3828.92s] uh multiple 11 to 12 times which yields
[3832.119s] North to 7 $70 a share so they&#39;ve got a
[3834.76s] 12mon price Target of
[3838.839s] $74 which is 21 times their 2025 EPS
[3843.48s] estimate at
[3844.559s] 345 no change there I think that&#39;s going
[3846.839s] to surprise to the upside and again I
[3849.24s] think it&#39;s a $100 stock over the next
[3850.92s] few years
[3853.16s] um us light vehicle sales to prize on
[3855.839s] the high side again in November if you
[3858.16s] remember September was weak October was
[3859.839s] great November&#39;s
[3861.799s] great make car sales great again over
[3864.76s] the LA over half of borrowing by smaller
[3867.44s] nonpublic businesses is linked to
[3869.44s] short-term rates so that&#39;s good for
[3871.64s] refinancing uh we get another cut I
[3874.52s] think if you see Cooper standard is
[3877.2s] going to cash pay their debt this
[3880.799s] quarter and if they can be cash flow
[3883.64s] positive in this
[3885.68s] quarter and you get another cut into
[3887.92s] year end I think they could Finance the
[3890.599s] whole slug of debt in the first quarter
[3894.079s] of next year
[3896.119s] at advantageous rates and then maybe do
[3899.119s] it again A year later and uh and then
[3902.4s] just roll it out to 2030 which we don&#39;t
[3904.52s] need we need three to four years for
[3906.039s] this thing to hit if that I mean at the
[3909.359s] rate things are going we&#39;re going to hit
[3910.559s] 17 SAR a lot quicker than anticipated
[3913.64s] and $7 of earnings maybe faster than
[3916.039s] anticipated and uh you know we
[3919.16s] understand what kind of businesses is
[3920.279s] although with the technology ad I think
[3922.319s] they&#39;re going to smooth out some of the
[3923.48s] cyclicality but um
[3926.92s] um anyway very exciting on that one city
[3929.52s] economic surprising by the way
[3930.88s] interesting thing about Advanced Auto
[3932.4s] Parts I hadn&#39;t planned to talk about it
[3934.039s] they got a debt downgrade duh uh this
[3937.119s] week it sold off and now it&#39;s back up
[3939.839s] 10% from where it sold off to which is
[3941.839s] pretty exciting to see so it was a final
[3944.68s] sell uh people selling in the hole and
[3947.96s] uh all the all the weak money&#39;s out now
[3950.2s] and uh Shane Shane o Kelly can can go
[3952.279s] execute on the dense plan in the number
[3955.0s] one and two month markets which we
[3956.279s] talked about two weeks ago super excited
[3958.279s] about that one city economic surprise
[3960.559s] index rolling over a little bit in the
[3963.0s] Euro Zone a little bit weaker so we keep
[3965.279s] an eye on that Peak growth priced for
[3967.68s] the Magnificent 7 last time they were
[3970.079s] that high was the end of
[3971.96s] 2021 uh you had a big correction in 2022
[3975.839s] in Tech so I think that&#39;s the I think
[3978.68s] that&#39;s the area to keep your eye on in
[3982.16s] 2025 if you&#39;re going to have any pain
[3984.92s] maybe it&#39;ll be in some of those selected
[3986.599s] names us which will keep the indices
[3989.599s] subdued and opportunity under the
[3991.24s] surface again 3.3 standard deviations
[3994.24s] This Is Us boom versus global bust go
[3996.96s] ahead and bet against that but if you
[3999.24s] don&#39;t take advantage of asymmetric
[4000.799s] opportunities with some portion of your
[4002.44s] portfolio you&#39;re never going to get
[4004.16s] seriously rich I mean the these are what
[4007.039s] wet dreams in the financial markets are
[4009.0s] made out of is taking asymmetric Bets
[4012.079s] with a limited side that has maximum
[4014.52s] upside Limited
[4016.2s] downside uh and if you do it with low
[4018.52s] leverage you can wait until it finally
[4020.319s] realizes in the irrs are through the
[4022.0s] roof all day
[4023.72s] long these gifts don&#39;t come around many
[4026.16s] times in a career Bank of America
[4028.0s] forecasting 100 we got that capex growth
[4030.96s] just accelerating for non magnificent
[4034.279s] 7 for the first time since 2022 so you
[4038.4s] can see some big capex in consumer
[4041.079s] discretionary
[4043.16s] energy uh Industrials on not Industrials
[4046.359s] Tech materials real estate com Services
[4049.92s] utilities Etc consensus expects 96% of
[4053.559s] companies to grow EPS year on-ear by uh
[4057.279s] Q4 2025 a record earnings breath that&#39;s
[4061.64s] a sign of Health follow the earnings
[4063.839s] ladies and gentlemen where is earnings
[4066.44s] growth accelerating where is it
[4068.16s] decelerating earnings growth is
[4070.2s] decelerating in mag 7 it is accelerating
[4073.279s] in unmagnify
[4075.559s] and in small caps tax loss selling by
[4078.52s] private clients typically curs in
[4080.2s] December that&#39;s usually what causes the
[4081.76s] weakness into the 15th and then you get
[4085.079s] the year-end rally the institutions do
[4087.76s] it in September and October that&#39;s why
[4091.279s] you get the weakest month of the year is
[4093.799s] September rolling four-week average
[4096.239s] Trends up by market cap so what do you
[4099.12s] see you see the exact wrong things
[4102.6s] happening everyone crowding into large
[4104.88s] cap everyone crowding out of midcap and
[4106.88s] small cap as they&#39;re finally taking off
[4109.0s] booming confidence in the stock market
[4110.96s] people point to that as a reason to get
[4112.52s] out except that&#39;s what happens at the
[4115.319s] beginning of every single uh new bull
[4119.48s] market you come off these extreme lows
[4122.239s] like 2001 and 2002 you get this dramatic
[4125.04s] Spike up people say everyone&#39;s too
[4126.839s] optimistic and it lasts for another few
[4128.92s] years 2009 off the extreme lows shoots
[4132.64s] all the way up by 2011 everyone&#39;s too
[4135.48s] optimistic it goes for another 10 years
[4138.52s] um same thing in the early 90s off this
[4141.199s] extreme low gets too extended everyone
[4143.279s] says people are too optimistic goes
[4144.88s] another nine years so you just have to
[4146.96s] know how to interpret these patterns
[4148.839s] because often it&#39;s it&#39;s not even that
[4150.799s] people don&#39;t have the data it&#39;s that
[4152.04s] they interpret it wrong and
[4155.279s] um corporate Insider buys is another
[4158.04s] bearish case if they there&#39;s you know
[4160.88s] they&#39;re least interest in Insider buys
[4164.48s] but we showed the data that shows
[4165.88s] they&#39;re always early by a couple of
[4167.799s] years service providers growing more
[4174.08s] upbeat this is a big inflection since uh
[4177.96s] in
[4179.159s] 2024 we talked about them being too
[4181.48s] early we talked about the 16.5 million
[4184.52s] SAR materials ladies and gentlemen
[4186.759s] bullish percent this is not what you see
[4189.08s] at the top this is when you want to be
[4190.359s] loading up on materials you can see the
[4192.48s] materials chart down here down here here
[4196.64s] and now
[4199.04s] so let&#39;s go quickly through here&#39;s the
[4202.28s] Chinese manufacturing PMI going straight
[4204.56s] up no headlines about that Mona 2 a
[4207.6s] Disney movie LED Thanksgiving box office
[4209.92s] uh could be best in post pandemic era so
[4212.6s] they&#39;ve got three of the best of the
[4214.08s] year they&#39;ve got Deadpool they&#39;ve got uh
[4218.28s] whatever that thing was inside out or
[4220.159s] outside in I have no idea and Mona
[4223.679s] too uh kicking but Disney just getting
[4227.0s] started it&#39;s so funny um I had dinner
[4230.36s] with Lou and he did that kind here in
[4233.88s] the city last night we had a fun time
[4235.52s] and he did that kind shout out last week
[4238.199s] and I was sat him I was like hey thanks
[4239.84s] for that nice shout out but I don&#39;t even
[4243.48s] like consider that a move yet you know
[4245.56s] 88 to 117 like it hasn&#39;t even begun like
[4249.64s] when it gets to 200 that&#39;s when we can
[4251.6s] do a shout out that that matters like I
[4254.0s] would not get in it without an
[4255.56s] expectation of a double over a few years
[4258.199s] um and I kind of walked him through the
[4259.52s] sum of the parts but uh awesome stuff
[4261.88s] there stimulus bets Drive Chinese stocks
[4263.88s] higher before key
[4266.84s] meeting uh Jack ma returns to Alibaba
[4269.96s] campus as China moves to boost business
[4272.92s] confidence dollar se&#39;s biggest weekly
[4275.36s] drop last week in a year As Trump trade
[4278.12s] stalls uh preview of Coming Attractions
[4280.56s] ladies and gentlemen wind Resorts is
[4282.32s] rising here&#39;s what we know uh there
[4286.52s] traffic did they do it
[4290.28s] here uh okay their credit got upgraded
[4293.28s] but the real reason they were up I think
[4294.92s] their traffic was
[4296.56s] up uh gosh I think let&#39;s see wind
[4299.88s] traffic I think it was up like
[4302.159s] 80%
[4304.08s] traffic
[4312.76s] maau surge in traffic our record number
[4315.92s] of visitors during the October golden

[4349.04s] Mainland visitors during this year&#39;s
[4350.4s] festivities accounted for
[4352.159s] 93 83.2% of the total Mainland visitors
[4356.12s] were 83.2 that means the Chinese
[4358.159s] consumers coming back if they&#39;re all
[4359.44s] going to
[4360.56s] gamble uh they were 83% and Hong Kong
[4363.44s] people were 11.8 so the game is back on
[4366.6s] is the season to go car shopping and
[4368.44s] there&#39;s some cherry news for buyers so
[4370.199s] what&#39;s that incentives going
[4373.4s] up um let me just see here if we got
[4377.32s] anything
[4381.679s] new
[4386.96s] summary that was not
[4392.6s] that okay forecast call nothing okay uh
[4397.8s] Intel Intel has more than 65% of the
[4401.44s] market for traditional PCS and 85% of
[4404.36s] the server Market Market according to
[4406.28s] Edward Jones look they&#39;ve screwed up a
[4409.6s] lot that&#39;s why the Stock&#39;s trading at
[4411.76s] $20
[4413.76s] um
[4415.8s] I&#39;m I&#39;m not a big fan of the firing of
[4420.08s] Ginger but I&#39;m also not against it and
[4422.44s] the reason I&#39;m not against
[4425.639s] it well here&#39;s the thing he did do the
[4429.36s] five no he&#39;s going to complete the five
[4430.92s] nodes in four years he&#39;s doing exactly
[4432.8s] what he said he was going to do it
[4433.76s] wasn&#39;t fast enough for the board
[4436.09s] [Music]
[4438.96s] um but there are some serious names in
[4443.08s] contention and one of the names in
[4444.84s] contention is a guy named lip
[4448.12s] buan and lip ban got into a company
[4452.44s] called Cadence Design
[4455.04s] cdns in January of 2009 and the stock
[4460.08s] was
[4462.04s] down
[4464.04s] 90% % it dropped from $24 to
[4469.52s] $242 uh from 2008 to 2009 when he got
[4472.88s] involved the stock then subsequently and
[4475.44s] he&#39;s still executive chairman by the way
[4477.28s] has gone from
[4479.08s] $242 to
[4481.6s] $328 under his tenure and I will say oh
[4485.8s] well he just got in at the bot bottom of
[4487.36s] the cycle he got lucky that&#39;s not the
[4489.28s] case because the the business had
[4491.32s] grinded sideways for the previous 15
[4494.0s] years and did nothing so it was this guy
[4497.239s] getting involved that turned it from a
[4498.92s] sleepy dead company to a money-making
[4502.719s] machine from 2009 to
[4506.08s] 2024 uh with
[4510.32s] uh basically
[4512.92s] a 60 no 150
[4518.199s] bagger it&#39;s not quite 150 bagger it&#39;s
[4520.719s] like 125 bagger not saying he&#39;s going to
[4523.719s] do that for Intel I&#39;m not saying he&#39;s
[4525.12s] going to be the pick but uh if we could
[4528.84s] bring in someone that would get the
[4530.48s] street excited I think when the 18a is
[4533.239s] done next
[4534.4s] year and they figure out what they want
[4536.88s] to be when they grow up with a new
[4539.36s] CEO
[4541.639s] uh look I know for certain that the
[4544.88s] business is worth $45 to $50 on the
[4548.96s] Legacy business and we&#39;ve said that
[4550.52s] since day one and we got involved we got
[4553.08s] a run up to $48 we we made a quick
[4555.639s] double we got out it came back to $29 we
[4558.199s] started to reinitiate oh and we got
[4560.92s] lucky lucky uh we had a chance to buy a
[4564.76s] ton in the High Teens uh and bring our
[4567.679s] bases back down for the second run at it
[4569.8s] and it&#39;ll run back up to 45 at some
[4572.48s] point and then we&#39;re going to decide is
[4574.76s] it all that it is just a just another
[4577.28s] double and we&#39;re out uh or has something
[4580.32s] changed and they can they become a real
[4582.08s] player with the big boys and girls and
[4584.719s] uh take advantage of some of these major
[4586.639s] trends that are happening over the next
[4588.08s] five years I think it&#39;s going to be the
[4589.88s] ladder and I think at 45 we&#39;re going to
[4591.719s] be hodlers to a lot higher 80 90 100 but
[4595.8s] but now you&#39;ve got an issue in the short
[4599.159s] term which is a problem which is now
[4601.159s] they have to go through a pretend search
[4603.84s] even if they know who they&#39;re going to
[4605.0s] do they got to drag it out for couple
[4607.6s] weeks not a couple weeks a couple of
[4609.679s] months of indecision about who&#39;s going
[4612.4s] to be the CEO what&#39;s going to be the
[4613.92s] next plan so it&#39;s be dead money for a
[4616.12s] couple of months that&#39;s the downside of
[4617.52s] Ginger being out the upside is if they
[4620.159s] liquidate it tomorrow we get all of our
[4621.679s] money back and probably a couple more
[4623.6s] bucks um and then the intrinsic value is
[4628.28s] a double on the Legacy business and um
[4631.719s] and maybe a five plus bagger if they
[4635.0s] actually get their head on straight get
[4636.52s] the right person doing it and the joke
[4639.679s] is going to be that probably everything
[4642.44s] gelsinger laid out comes to pass and
[4645.159s] someone else gets the credit and
[4649.639s] um and that&#39;ll be fine too so uh so
[4653.36s] that&#39;s that&#39;s the story on
[4664.12s] Intel China&#39;s leaders plan to discuss
[4666.92s] GDP Target and stimulus next week that
[4669.76s] is on
[4673.36s] Wednesday closed door Central economic
[4675.56s] work
[4677.6s] conference economic targets and stimulus
[4680.239s] plans for 2025 so you can see they&#39;re
[4682.84s] doing the same exact Playbook that they
[4684.56s] did in 2016 after the inauguration they
[4687.28s] weaken the Yuan and they say okay put on
[4691.0s] another 10% tariffs we&#39;ll just lower the
[4693.239s] value of our currency by another 10% and
[4695.44s] have no net effect on our economy uh and
[4698.52s] then after he gets inaugurated then you
[4701.0s] know the the game gets back on Trump
[4703.48s] looks good has noet effect on China
[4706.199s] because they&#39;ve lowered their currency
[4707.639s] against it and then the tariffs wind up
[4710.0s] being less the Yuan appreciates the
[4712.4s] dollar weekends and We&#39;re Off to the
[4714.36s] Races with emerging markets in China
[4716.239s] same story different year Alibaba Cloud
[4720.239s] aims high in Southeast Asia in 2025 with
[4723.92s] new AI Partners they&#39;re dominating
[4726.04s] Indonesia Thailand other markets CEOs
[4729.239s] are getting tossed out at a record Pace
[4731.32s] that is the opportunity for us we love
[4733.639s] it in Intel we love it in Advanced Auto
[4736.84s] Parts we love it in PayPal by the way
[4739.36s] which no one&#39;s talking about we love it
[4741.04s] in Boeing we love it in um I mean it&#39;s
[4744.8s] it&#39;s almost turnaround Tom&#39;s Playbook I
[4746.76s] mean every company I get involved in is
[4748.28s] the new CEO we love it in uh Este louder
[4751.199s] we&#39;re getting a new
[4752.6s] CEO
[4756.08s] um what else what are we missing here
[4758.96s] gener did it with the same CEO Cooper
[4761.0s] sard&#39;s going to do it with the same
[4763.52s] CEO uh um gxo is going to get a new CEO
[4768.0s] that that&#39;s that&#39;s good um and what
[4772.92s] else anyway so that&#39;s a good thing
[4775.4s] that&#39;s a catalyst for change especially
[4776.76s] when they get the right guys in there
[4777.96s] like Alex Chris like Shane o Kelly like
[4780.679s] so many others that we&#39;ve talked about
[4783.12s] uh Intel considers Outsiders for CEO
[4786.28s] including Marvel&#39;s head Marvel said no
[4788.84s] but lip Buu ton for my money that would
[4791.8s] be the miracle Choice uh makes two to
[4794.8s] much sense they won&#39;t do it but look
[4796.32s] when you have 65 and 85% of certain
[4800.08s] markets look they&#39;ve worked overtime to
[4802.239s] try to screw it up but it&#39;s very hard to
[4804.56s] destroy that and um if they can get
[4806.84s] someone with a pulse and a heartbeat in
[4809.32s] uh and catch a catch the next Cy upgrade
[4811.679s] cycle it&#39;s going to make a lot of money
[4813.6s] even if they&#39;ve got you know basically a
[4815.239s] weekend up Joe Biden could run the
[4817.12s] company and it would it would recover
[4819.48s] back to 45 I don&#39;t know if it would
[4822.36s] recover back I don&#39;t know if it would go
[4823.8s] to 80 or 90 on the new plan but he could
[4826.48s] run it uh and it would definitely
[4828.76s] rebound back to 4045 so that that tells
[4831.239s] you everything you need to know gxo
[4833.48s] spurns acquisition offers as CEO Wilson
[4836.84s] steps down uh we covered
[4840.04s] that are we up to oh wow we&#39;re up to the
[4842.76s] article of the week all right covered
[4845.679s] that covered that albam Marl so here&#39;s
[4848.48s] the chart several months ago we
[4849.96s] discussed a new position in albam Maro
[4851.679s] basis
[4852.719s] 9322 it&#39;s not a large uh position yet
[4855.679s] because of the time of initiation there
[4858.08s] was limited excess uninvested Capital to
[4860.199s] put to work as new capital came in price
[4862.28s] ran away from us we don&#39;t buy up we do
[4864.6s] think we will get additional
[4865.8s] opportunities to size up this position
[4867.719s] as more data comes in maybe today we
[4870.4s] didn&#39;t add yet today but we I&#39;d like to
[4872.84s] see it back in the 90s before I started
[4874.76s] to look to size up um but if not we&#39;re
[4879.04s] okay with what we have Alam Maro is in
[4881.48s] keeping with our theme to find more
[4882.96s] materials exposure in 2025
[4885.08s] as the sector has been decimated and
[4886.52s] earnings growth is expected to recover
[4888.12s] handsomely estimates are for 18.9%
[4890.8s] earnings growth uh up from 18.7 just a
[4893.92s] few months ago for
[4895.76s] 2025 Alba Mar&#39;s primary business is
[4898.44s] lithium production we can see below the
[4900.32s] Stock&#39;s most recent Spike and collapse
[4902.0s] in price from 21 to 24 correlates with
[4905.52s] the spike and drop of the price of
[4907.08s] lipian carbonate so car lithium
[4909.4s] carbonate ripped higher collapsed albam
[4912.8s] Maro stock price ripped higher collapsed
[4915.6s] I I generally avoid commodity stocks for
[4917.56s] this very reason basically because you
[4919.719s] got to get two things right you got to
[4921.08s] get the commodity right and you got to
[4922.4s] get the company operations right um
[4925.88s] that&#39;s with the exception of oil and
[4927.4s] natural gas stocks when I can buy the
[4928.92s] commodity cheaper on the New York Stock
[4930.44s] Exchange than in the fields I learned
[4932.4s] that tactic from Reading uh John Paul
[4934.36s] Getty&#39;s legendary book how to be rich
[4936.52s] highly recommend for everyone however
[4939.159s] when you look at Alba maro&#39;s long-term
[4941.44s] price chart the correlation unravels
[4943.88s] Alba Marl has historically has a moat
[4945.639s] around its business which when executing
[4947.8s] at proper levels can mint money
[4949.48s] irrespective of the price of the
[4950.88s] underlying commodity so if you look in
[4953.08s] the short term you see yeah this huge
[4954.92s] blip that huge blip actually this one
[4957.159s] was the 2016 to 18 blip uh and this one
[4961.56s] was the 2020 to 24
[4965.32s] blip um but if you go back further then
[4967.8s] you had like 10 years and you still had
[4970.8s] a business That Grew From $5 a share to
[4973.8s] $65 a share with effectively flat
[4976.639s] lithium carbonate prices China&#39;s
[4979.239s] appetite for EVS shows no sign of
[4981.28s] abating even if in North America sales
[4983.8s] have softened of late if these estimates
[4986.0s] prove to be 25% true albamar will not
[4988.8s] not be able to handle all the demand
[4990.28s] required in coming years reminds me of
[4992.04s] Boeing Boeing Boeing&#39;s got 10 years of
[4993.92s] backlog that&#39;s what&#39;s albam Maro is
[4995.6s] going to be uh based on current trends
[4997.76s] Bloomberg NF forecast that by 2027
[4999.96s] annual Global sales of Passenger EVS
[5001.639s] will top 30 million rising to 73 million
[5003.719s] by 20 40 penetration rates will hit 33%
[5006.8s] in 2027 73% in
[5009.52s] 2040 I think that&#39;s optimistic between
[5012.0s] 2024 to 2027 kager is expected to be
[5015.76s] around 21% a sharp drop from the 20 to
[5018.239s] 2023 surge EV stock will grow from 41
[5022.0s] million at the end of 2023 to 132
[5024.28s] Million by
[5026.4s] 2027 from their lips to
[5028.84s] God uh Cooper standard has I believe 20
[5032.4s] more per Parts capacity on EV than they
[5034.88s] do on IES so they make 20% more per car
[5039.0s] but if you look at this when you look at
[5041.08s] the American part of this uh you can see
[5044.159s] why we have such a jaded view like we
[5046.6s] you can&#39;t even see us on this
[5048.719s] map rest of the world like you can&#39;t
[5052.52s] even see where America fits in on this
[5054.32s] growth all the growth is in China and
[5057.0s] China&#39;s been pushing the EV so if the
[5059.08s] government&#39;s pushing it just like
[5060.4s] they&#39;ll push it to over capacity but
[5063.239s] again where the Arms Dealer so just like
[5065.84s] we love selling the sealers and the
[5069.76s] fluid transfer systems and the fuel
[5071.239s] delivery of Cooper standard to the oems
[5073.56s] who are going to race to the bottom
[5075.6s] overproduce and cut margins like it&#39;s
[5077.88s] going out of style
[5080.76s] um same thing with the lithium producer
[5083.719s] albam Maro let them oversupply flood the
[5087.08s] market with EVS we benefit from all the
[5089.8s] lithium required to go in and we&#39;re
[5091.8s] buying it like Buffett said
[5100.52s] oh in this
[5104.44s] one four available at a very attractive
[5108.92s] price that is the key that most people
[5111.679s] forget
[5114.199s] um so you can see again it&#39;s it&#39;s all
[5117.48s] about China EV demand that&#39;s going to
[5119.719s] that&#39;s going to benefit lithium that&#39;s
[5121.76s] going to benefit albam Maro and uh uh as
[5125.04s] the West Begins to acknowledge the
[5127.48s] recovery in China as it continues to
[5130.32s] proliferate and sentiment changes
[5132.44s] everything with any tie into China is
[5134.0s] going to go through the roof whether
[5135.119s] that&#39;s Starbucks whether that&#39;s Estee
[5136.8s] louder whether that&#39;s her whether that&#39;s
[5139.4s] Nike whether that&#39;s Lulu whether that&#39;s
[5142.239s] Alibaba whether that&#39;s albam Maro SE
[5145.76s] louder uh they&#39;re going to go so fast
[5148.88s] and it&#39;s going to it&#39;s not going to let
[5150.6s] anyone in so whether that&#39;s the wec
[5153.92s] meeting and they say we&#39;re going to do
[5155.76s] 5% GDP and we&#39;re going to do the
[5157.88s] stimulus to actually get it done uh or
[5160.44s] it&#39;s the next meeting or who knows uh or
[5163.199s] it&#39;s just the inflection into January 1
[5165.639s] like it was after Trump got elected last
[5167.8s] time uh it&#39;s really immaterial the key
[5170.44s] is it&#39;s imminent and what you see here
[5173.679s] in the long-term Alber uh albam Maro
[5176.52s] data 2024 was an aberration due to
[5179.4s] short-term Global lithium overc capacity
[5182.239s] which is what happens in commodity
[5183.719s] cyclical
[5186.08s] businesses
[5188.119s] but if you look back sales are sales per
[5192.119s] share are
[5193.56s] still much higher than
[5195.92s] 2021 uh approaching 2022 levels next
[5199.639s] year we&#39;ll be back to 22 levels 2023 was
[5202.199s] an aberration and you came off the boil
[5203.96s] so if you draw out the long-term average
[5205.8s] trend line uh it&#39;s it&#39;s doing fine okay
[5210.08s] and certainly they got cut off at the
[5212.0s] kneecaps but the price reflects that so
[5215.32s] you know you have a stock that dropped
[5223.92s] from
[5225.44s] $327 to
[5227.119s] $71 okay
[5231.8s] and with huge leverage around the prices
[5236.32s] of lithium which are at or near historic
[5240.96s] lows in the short term
[5246.0s] and the Chinese government is not going
[5247.52s] to let up on EVS because that puts a lot
[5250.88s] of people to work that&#39;s their
[5252.199s] initiative and they&#39;re going to push it
[5254.92s] uh till the cows come home which is
[5256.56s] going to help the Chinese economy
[5259.239s] Chinese manufacturing and it&#39;s going to
[5261.0s] help albam Maro
[5263.48s] so um you could see here in the value
[5266.36s] line estimates they&#39;re expecting a
[5267.639s] recovery and then a reexpansion out to
[5270.44s] 2027
[5272.04s] 2029 but historically you look at this
[5274.96s] business and the return on Capital has
[5277.4s] been
[5278.56s] solid High single digits low double
[5280.96s] digits for a decade plus return on
[5283.44s] Equity uh even higher uh net profit
[5288.4s] solid operating margins in the in the
[5291.4s] low to mid
[5292.8s] 20s
[5293.91s] [Music]
[5296.32s] um they pay out a little dividend while
[5298.84s] you wait earnings per share have been
[5301.32s] growing they peaked in 2022 they&#39;ll
[5303.719s] recover
[5304.639s] back uh cash flow per share is hanging
[5307.199s] in there we&#39;ll be cash flow positive
[5309.0s] again next year so all the things are in
[5312.08s] the perfect situation for a turnaround
[5315.199s] Tom
[5316.48s] special um and by the way speaking of
[5318.88s] turnaround Tom specials uh I was going
[5321.28s] to speak about Etsy on uh claiming
[5324.56s] countdown today I got bumped till next
[5326.8s] Tuesday which I&#39;ll be doing live from
[5329.28s] California for the first time pretty
[5331.199s] excited to do that um and etsy&#39;s up you
[5335.36s] know in the blink of an eye again some
[5337.199s] of these things slow some of them fast
[5339.36s] from $49 basis to $59 in a matter of
[5343.28s] weeks uh any fundamental reason for you
[5346.4s] know 20% plus move in a few weeks no
[5350.679s] okay uh
[5354.119s] so it&#39;s just how it works buy good
[5356.4s] businesses at attractive prices Take the
[5358.639s] Long View some happen faster some happen
[5360.8s] slower but over a a book of 10 to 12
[5364.32s] good companies you&#39;re going to
[5365.239s] outperform over time is really what it
[5367.0s] comes down to uh as so we&#39;ll go through
[5370.719s] a couple of these bullets because we&#39;ve
[5372.0s] got a lot of questions this week as
[5373.679s] electric vehicle adoption increases we
[5375.239s] expect double- digit annual growth in
[5377.119s] global lithium demand generate healthy
[5379.96s] bromine profits due to its low cost
[5382.04s] position in the Dead Sea they have the
[5383.639s] lowest
[5384.719s] cost um production of
[5388.36s] bromine uh let&#39;s see
[5392.36s] here lithium prices will rebound and
[5395.119s] then remain well above the marginal cost
[5397.28s] of production to at least the remainder
[5398.76s] of the decade leading to excess profits
[5401.08s] and return on invested capital for albam
[5404.119s] Maro
[5405.679s] um their Chilean operation is among the
[5408.239s] world&#39;s lowest cost sources of
[5410.679s] lithium they have their own salt brine
[5413.119s] Assets in Chile and the United States
[5415.119s] and two joint V interests in Australian
[5417.56s] mines talison green brush bushes and
[5422.119s] wagina
[5427.88s] they do the energy storage largest
[5429.88s] producer one of the world&#39;s largest
[5431.52s] producers of lithium for battery
[5432.92s] applications including electric vehicles
[5435.36s] diverse portfolio of Highly specialized
[5437.159s] lithium and bromine Solutions and then a
[5439.4s] lader in refining and petrochemical
[5443.48s] catalysts they&#39;ve taken a broad set of
[5446.199s] actions to maintain their long-term
[5447.96s] competitive position since July and you
[5450.8s] can see that they&#39;ve hit most of their
[5452.6s] milestones and they&#39;ve got upside for
[5454.56s] more they&#39;ve taken a couple hundred
[5456.679s] million dollar of cost
[5458.44s] out um and they&#39;re going to get to three
[5461.84s] to $400 million of cost out they&#39;ve
[5464.36s] taken their capex down their balance
[5466.4s] sheet is great they&#39;ve got 3.4 billion
[5470.48s] of liquidity with $1.7 billion of cash
[5473.32s] and cash equivalent a $ 1.5 billion
[5476.119s] revolver so solvency risk is off the
[5478.719s] table which is a critical thing in
[5480.679s] turnaround Tom&#39;s checklist of
[5482.719s] turnarounds
[5484.4s] uh and
[5486.719s] um lithium as lithium battery pack
[5489.76s] prices come down their demand goes up
[5492.44s] demand out to
[5494.28s] 2030 you can see here cost advantages
[5498.88s] resources improving existing resources
[5501.32s] and accessing non-conventional with
[5503.8s] direct lithium extraction which will be
[5506.04s] online next year uh breakthrough OEM
[5509.84s] opportunities for greater than 50% more
[5511.6s] EV range with battery material in
[5514.36s] ation and then the bromine concentration
[5517.679s] they have in the Dead Sea concentrate in
[5519.96s] Arkansas is Extreme relative to other
[5522.88s] places in the world and their industrial
[5525.119s] cost curve for the elemental bromine is
[5527.239s] the cheapest in the world where they
[5528.8s] have the
[5530.679s] deposits
[5532.76s] um allocating Capital to the highest
[5535.36s] return opportunities in sustainability
[5536.96s] and productivity consistently achieving
[5539.0s] returns above two times their weighted
[5541.32s] average cost of capital Target that&#39;s
[5544.36s] what we like to see the high return on
[5546.32s] invested Capital over their weighted
[5549.04s] average cost of capital Global EV demand
[5552.08s] growth 23% year-to date so we in America
[5555.0s] it feels like EVS are slowing uh but in
[5558.28s] China they&#39;re going faster than ever and
[5560.28s] that&#39;s why you see Elon Musk spending
[5562.08s] all of his time over in China and focus
[5564.8s] on China so lithium doesn&#39;t care where
[5567.32s] it has to go the key is that the overall
[5570.4s] number in the world is going up and
[5572.56s] China will be exporting tons of EVS to
[5574.84s] everywhere in the world except for the
[5576.36s] United States uh and that will continue
[5578.84s] to help Alam
[5580.28s] Maro
[5581.84s] um so their volumes and energy storage
[5584.4s] and Specialties were up 16% and 4%
[5587.119s] respectively jused iov 21 million even
[5590.92s] in the worst environment cash from
[5592.639s] operations 241 million and then you can
[5595.4s] see here the sensitivity to the price of
[5598.92s] lithium as the price of lithium
[5601.08s] normalizes the impact on eida
[5604.28s] you basically get Triple the ebit op for
[5606.28s] double the price I mean it&#39;s it&#39;s insane
[5609.6s] uh again this is not fear and greed
[5611.56s] index not at a level of extreme where
[5613.639s] you want to get out of everything or
[5615.639s] even much of anything for that matter um
[5619.159s] clayman&#39;s next Tuesday at 300 PM instead
[5622.96s] of today I&#39;ll be speaking at the money
[5625.08s] show on Saturday so I&#39;ll be down there
[5627.36s] Thursday for dinner uh Wednesday
[5630.239s] afternoon and a little bit of Friday
[5631.84s] afternoon for any existing clients or
[5634.04s] new potential clients that want to meet
[5635.44s] for a coffee reach out through the
[5637.6s] contact form and earnings
[5641.96s] materials uh this is why it&#39;s beat down
[5644.6s] estimates down 5.6% in the last 60 days
[5647.639s] growth IBD growth stocks top 30 weights
[5650.56s] last 60 days revised up 12.88 that&#39;s why
[5653.32s] you&#39;re going to see Ark continue to do
[5655.159s] okay and recover Like a Phoenix From the
[5658.88s] Ashes uh earnings turning up estimates
[5662.32s] turning up
[5666.8s] and Industrial manufacturing PMI came in
[5669.84s] better than expected so we&#39;ve talked
[5671.32s] about this job openings were better than
[5675.08s] expected
[5676.22s] [Music]
[5677.88s] um Etc so the jobs report is critical on
[5681.0s] Friday and let&#39;s get back to the ask me
[5684.159s] anything questions so for those of you
[5686.48s] who don&#39;t like the ask me anything
[5687.88s] question part thank you for tuning in
[5689.639s] we&#39;ll be back next week live from
[5692.119s] California for the first time this week
[5694.04s] was from New York City uh and for those
[5697.8s] of you who do like to ask me anything
[5699.639s] questions and learn a lot from them uh
[5702.679s] let&#39;s get
[5707.199s] started uh no name asks hey Tom love
[5710.0s] your videos what do you think about
[5711.199s] French stocks like AXA BNP party boss
[5714.04s] Society General at the moment I would
[5716.48s] never consider European Bank they&#39;re the
[5718.6s] biggest garbage businesses in the
[5721.119s] history of humanity um and next week
[5724.08s] I&#39;ll tell you how I really feel about
[5725.52s] European banks with the exception of UBS
[5727.719s] which is a high quality business that a
[5729.199s] good friend works at uh but um and ah
[5733.44s] Deutsche
[5734.76s] Bank no but but stock CH and B&amp;P uh you
[5739.4s] couldn&#39;t it&#39;s it&#39;s the worst combination
[5741.52s] of everything you could ever imagine
[5742.96s] it&#39;s a cultural cess pool that I want in
[5747.719s] aggregate there are fantastic people at
[5750.56s] every Bank individual people I like I
[5753.84s] respect the whole thing in aggregate
[5756.8s] they&#39;re just credit s part
[5758.6s] two uh Gus Mia you do an amazing job Tom
[5763.239s] want to thank you for all your advice
[5764.96s] it&#39;s opinion not advice uh go to hedge
[5767.32s] fund tips.com click on terms we don&#39;t
[5770.199s] know your financial situation we deal
[5771.679s] exclusively with accredited investors
[5773.6s] and qualified clients and uh
[5777.32s] institutions talk to your financial
[5779.119s] adviser before you do
[5782.56s] anything in a short period of time I&#39;ve
[5784.679s] learned a lot and hope one day to become
[5786.239s] a client of yours we&#39;ll be here when
[5788.28s] you&#39;re ready I would value your view on
[5791.32s] the following mwp medical properties
[5793.76s] trust seems to have bottomed in a major
[5795.96s] turnaround whilst deleveraging could be
[5798.239s] two or 3x I think we looked at this one
[5800.159s] a few weeks ago and for
[5802.44s] me uh there was some solvency risk and I
[5807.36s] don&#39;t really like the business so while
[5809.56s] you&#39;re probably
[5811.0s] right um
[5813.76s] I didn&#39;t want to be involved because
[5815.88s] there was still solvency
[5819.08s] risk medical Property
[5827.56s] Trust mpw
[5844.4s] I mean I don&#39;t I don&#39;t know where the
[5845.56s] turnaround comes from the the the free
[5847.639s] cash flow deterioration shows no end in
[5850.239s] sight revenues are having I mean this
[5853.48s] looks like a cigar butt maybe you&#39;ll get
[5855.04s] one last puff out of it for a trade but
[5857.239s] unless you can get confidence in the
[5859.719s] turnaround like what has happened to
[5862.0s] this
[5863.0s] business
[5864.84s] um I think you&#39;re playing with fire
[5873.8s] let&#39;s take a closer look
[5879.8s] here so I got 275 million of
[5885.679s] cash and
[5887.4s] $9.2 billion of debt I mean yes that
[5890.92s] debt is secured by assets how much
[5893.4s] assets we have here 10 billion so you
[5898.28s] basically got in theory
[5908.599s] yeah I I don&#39;t like this I think I think
[5911.639s] you got I&#39;d have to spend a lot of time
[5914.4s] on it but I think you got close to
[5915.76s] enough solvency risk and if it&#39;s close
[5917.719s] to enough and it&#39;s a lower quality
[5919.199s] business I don&#39;t want to play there even
[5921.0s] if if the trade could be a double or
[5922.36s] triple if they pull it off um
[5944.04s] I think you&#39;re playing with fire here I
[5945.36s] would avoid even though the trade will
[5947.8s] probably work in the short term in the
[5949.159s] long term it&#39;s not a good
[5951.719s] business
[5954.04s] um all right so a guy I&#39;m not going to
[5957.199s] say his name sent me
[5959.8s] like basically a
[5962.199s] statement uh um Intel CEO resigns no
[5966.08s] kidding expected to stay at least until
[5968.639s] 18a was out the door next year maybe he
[5970.88s] knows something we don&#39;t he didn&#39;t
[5972.8s] resign he got his ass kicked out the
[5974.44s] door because the board became impatient
[5976.199s] because they all want to keep their
[5977.04s] $300,000 a year jobs for showing up for
[5979.36s] four meetings that&#39;s number one um gouty
[5982.92s] GPU ships currently disappointing winter
[5985.599s] takes all business blah blah blah it&#39;s
[5988.119s] not a winner takes all business in the
[5990.0s] short term it always is until they get
[5992.8s] um
[5994.76s] competition it&#39;s the same with the gp1s
[5997.0s] it&#39;ll be the same with these chips uh so
[5999.52s] that&#39;s a false premise uh in any
[6002.88s] reasonable time
[6004.679s] frame in the minute if you read the
[6007.159s] headlines that&#39;s correct it&#39;s incorrect
[6009.04s] if you look study anything past a year
[6012.04s] history uh are Intel&#39;s problems too big
[6014.8s] to fix by Dan Gallagher in the Wall
[6016.56s] Street Journal sure Intel is strategic
[6018.84s] for the US and has defense contracts but
[6020.679s] it also needs to survive and thrive as a
[6022.199s] business so that was it he sent a period
[6025.44s] And I just replied back and I said is
[6027.76s] there a question or have you already
[6029.159s] made up your mind and he and he said I
[6031.599s] wanted to know if you changed
[6033.76s] your view so first off thank you for
[6037.48s] listening to our podcast second off
[6039.8s] thank you for sending a question third
[6041.84s] nothing&#39;s changed I I honestly don&#39;t
[6045.04s] think they had to fire
[6047.56s] gelsinger um but I think there&#39;s a
[6051.239s] possibility that because they did
[6056.32s] his planning his plan coming through
[6059.199s] under a different face will get the
[6061.44s] stock accelerated much faster than his
[6063.56s] plan coming through under his own face
[6066.52s] and I know that sounds silly but there&#39;s
[6068.52s] sentiment around him and there&#39;s so much
[6071.199s] failure baked around him with the pro
[6073.56s] problems that he inherited and couldn&#39;t
[6076.28s] turn the ship around fast enough that I
[6078.239s] think even if the ship turned around
[6080.0s] people wouldn&#39;t believe it uh whereas a
[6082.639s] new face like the guy I talked about
[6084.96s] who&#39;s got a huge track record of success
[6087.28s] when that 18a hits next year and the uh
[6089.84s] five nodes in four years plays
[6093.52s] out he&#39;ll get all the credit even though
[6096.04s] Ginger laid all the foundation and the
[6097.96s] market will believe it because they&#39;re
[6099.28s] not looking at all the money they lost
[6101.639s] under
[6102.56s] Ginger uh and the hatred they have for
[6105.119s] that they will be looking at new face
[6108.84s] new results New outcomes so it may
[6112.76s] improve prove our irr meaning it will
[6115.52s] take a lot less time any bit of good
[6117.28s] news with a new face will be believed
[6119.8s] and bought whereas any good news under
[6121.76s] Ginger people would say oh it&#39;s just a
[6123.4s] fake out this guy loses every time blah
[6125.599s] blah blah blah blah so uh I think it&#39;ll
[6128.32s] be a net positive in that
[6131.88s] regard CK says big fan of the Pod take a
[6136.28s] look at
[6138.159s] newor
[6140.0s] uh I don&#39;t like steel stocks
[6144.56s] no
[6145.96s] interest next Jason Z can you look at IM
[6156.84s] kta this is a special situation this
[6159.32s] takes a lot longer to look at than five
[6161.08s] minutes it&#39;s like a land
[6164.119s] holding m kta
[6191.599s] real estate company Moonlighting add a
[6193.719s] commercial Plaza lease operator and
[6196.32s] grocery stores throughout the Carolinas
[6210.76s] all right let&#39;s take a look
[6213.36s] here the balance sheet and see what kind
[6216.08s] of credit&#39;s given for this 3600 acres of
[6231.719s] land one half billion
[6239.0s] dollar 500 million at
[6247.04s] debt
[6249.48s] longterm uh let&#39;s see if they&#39;re
[6251.32s] generating any
[6255.88s] cash 100 million
[6264.4s] revenues are
[6268.96s] growing earnings are growing so I would
[6271.36s] like to find out what did they make some
[6273.28s] big acquisition or something to
[6277.159s] get this earnings
[6281.159s] jump
[6287.599s] um I mean there are two businesses I
[6289.88s] don&#39;t really
[6291.36s] like supermarket
[6293.639s] and these kind of
[6296.28s] like land plays that take 10 years to
[6300.08s] like St Joe&#39;s and Howard Hughes Corp
[6302.4s] it&#39;s just just takes forever to work out
[6305.239s] and it&#39;s just dead money and they hire
[6307.04s] better uses so I&#39;m going to pass on this
[6309.239s] one I like the creativity but it&#39;s not
[6311.48s] for
[6312.32s] me uh cork asked me to go speak to his
[6314.88s] students which I probably will in
[6316.4s] January in California JP would love to
[6319.36s] hear your thoughts on Pags I know we&#39;ve
[6322.0s] covered before take another look the new
[6324.76s] look is
[6326.199s] no
[6329.4s] um what&#39;s
[6333.92s] changed you&#39;re never going to know what
[6336.44s] Consumer loans are in that on that
[6338.239s] balance sheet you no way you&#39;re ever
[6340.08s] going to know so you can gamble on it
[6343.239s] the trade will probably work cash flow
[6344.8s] is turning negative price is priced for
[6348.239s] death
[6350.239s] um so then you got to do some solv
[6353.28s] analysis but you really don&#39;t know what
[6354.599s] you&#39;re holding because of all the off
[6356.239s] balance sheet Consumer
[6358.119s] Debt uh and credit receivables and
[6362.8s] there&#39;s no way you&#39;re going to get
[6363.88s] transparency on this
[6385.0s] and keep burning free cash
[6387.84s] so uh I have any cash 132
[6400.76s] million I think it&#39;s I think it&#39;s
[6404.159s] like more than a coin flip
[6406.84s] bankruptcy and if it works it&#39;ll go to
[6409.0s] like 30 so you do asymmetry like that
[6412.679s] with like 1% 2%
[6415.56s] position if you lose you lose 2% of your
[6418.84s] portfolio if you if you
[6421.52s] win you make 4X so you make 8% total
[6426.4s] contribution I I just I don&#39;t want to
[6428.719s] play there um
[6432.0s] Sagar hope you had a wonderful
[6433.719s] Thanksgiving we did thank you very much
[6436.28s] speaking of
[6438.0s] which we missed some photos
[6446.679s] there ones of my
[6458.92s] mom H I&#39;ll have to show them next week
[6462.32s] they didn&#39;t come through all right yeah
[6463.88s] I had pictures from
[6466.119s] Thanksgiving my bad all right uh Stone
[6470.84s] energy same story
[6473.92s] this is from
[6475.92s] uh
[6478.56s] Saar we&#39;ve covered this before and the
[6481.119s] answer was
[6484.28s] no wait Stone Co
[6491.04s] rather
[6493.28s] again negative cash flow
[6509.239s] you still have a bad government
[6510.599s] situation
[6512.08s] in in Brazil
[6533.36s] I mean if you have to take a bet on one
[6535.4s] of these two I would take it on Stone Co
[6537.599s] for
[6538.96s] sure this one might actually warrant
[6541.28s] some work
[6567.96s] so I just want to understand
[6570.599s] why the cash is getting burned and
[6574.32s] what&#39;s going to change about that
[6576.719s] anytime soon they have a decent enough
[6578.8s] balance sheet that they can withstand
[6580.239s] some I want to understand like what&#39;s
[6582.8s] the turnaround
[6584.679s] situation who is running it when it was
[6587.119s] at 95 who&#39;s running it now what&#39;s their
[6589.4s] plan to turn it around this one is
[6591.56s] probably worth doing some work work um I
[6594.239s] think Buffett owned it for a minute I
[6595.76s] don&#39;t think he owns
[6597.199s] anymore so I want to take a look at this
[6600.159s] if I want Brazilian
[6601.84s] exposure this one might be the one to
[6603.84s] look at but no high conviction there yet
[6607.84s] Martin schling from Vienna
[6612.56s] Austria schleig
[6616.119s] schn uh listening to you for a longer
[6619.199s] time now already well hopefully future
[6621.679s] investor
[6623.96s] uh do for my Austrian holding thank you
[6627.159s] very much for your insights made really
[6629.36s] nice profits over the last 18 months
[6631.04s] already good uh video cast is so much
[6633.719s] fun to listen in all right uh thank you
[6637.8s] comp you
[6640.92s] grab
[6643.0s] okay c m
[6646.719s] p u g
[6649.88s] r o u b
[6661.719s] got hit it
[6668.32s] hard ctm
[6692.88s] let&#39;s
[6693.92s] see comp you
[6699.32s] group there it
[6706.679s] is ealth Services worldwide ambulatory
[6711.04s] Information Systems
[6714.96s] impatient
[6716.88s] software again I mean it&#39;s very tough to
[6720.0s] tell if they have an actual mode of
[6721.56s] their
[6723.599s] business uh let&#39;s take a
[6726.56s] look it&#39;s been a lowquality business for
[6729.0s] a lot of
[6730.4s] years I don&#39;t see why that would
[6734.719s] change $80 million of cash8 they got 80
[6738.84s] million of cash
[6741.52s] and 800 of long-term debt no
[6746.199s] bueno cash flow
[6755.0s] is
[6757.159s] positive free cash flow and what&#39;s
[6760.239s] happening with the revenues so they must
[6761.84s] have done a big acquisition here
[6781.96s] so it&#39;s a broken covid stock um a lot of
[6785.239s] these broken covid stocks are coming
[6787.0s] back like Etsy like PayPal like
[6792.119s] gener uh so there might be something
[6795.4s] here uh I think
[6799.079s] that okay so they named a new CEO in May
[6805.159s] he was chief officer at the German ealth
[6808.599s] company prior to the oh he was the
[6815.36s] CFO so they put the CFO in so you just
[6818.56s] have to understand his turnaround story
[6821.119s] and why their software has a an
[6823.639s] impenetrable Moe uh and that takes a lot
[6827.119s] more work than just looking at the
[6831.04s] financials um so first thing you want to
[6833.92s] start to study is who are their
[6836.079s] competitors and have they been gaining
[6838.0s] or losing share and try to understand
[6839.84s] the technology mod which is and I&#39;m not
[6842.159s] dismissing it this is it&#39;s a very hard
[6844.44s] exercise and this is why Buffett for so
[6846.4s] many years avoided software and
[6848.639s] technology
[6849.76s] companies
[6852.079s] um is because the barriers to entry are
[6855.119s] low and you just have to understand how
[6858.04s] the software works and why it can&#39;t be
[6860.119s] disrupted and that&#39;s a hard hard
[6862.96s] ask um if you can buy it with enough
[6865.96s] margin of safety that&#39;s a good thing it
[6868.199s] looks like this thing is turning so I
[6869.8s] like your your thought process but you
[6871.48s] really have to understand it otherwise
[6873.0s] you just put it in the too hard bin Matt
[6875.599s] tumau thoughts on Intel&#39;s new CEO the
[6878.96s] interim it&#39;s just a placeholder uh no
[6882.239s] thoughts uh we&#39;re not going to know
[6883.96s] anything for two months so don&#39;t expect
[6885.4s] miracles unless they panic and appoint
[6887.32s] the guy who I want from Cadence and they
[6889.8s] do it quickly um but boards never do
[6894.48s] that they don&#39;t get paid by the uh the
[6897.159s] hour miles
[6899.88s] Frasier really enjoying the podcast
[6902.199s] wanted to get your thoughts on two
[6903.52s] stocks JD and Dollar
[6910.8s] General uh Dollar General we&#39;ve been
[6912.96s] looking at for a while I think we would
[6915.239s] probably be more inclined to go with
[6916.92s] Dollar Tree we&#39;re not doing that because
[6919.239s] we have enough exposure with a similar
[6921.48s] low-end consumer cons retailer called
[6923.48s] Advanced Auto Parts which we like but if
[6926.119s] we didn&#39;t own Advanced Auto Parts we&#39;d
[6928.199s] probably take a very serious look at
[6930.599s] both of Dollar Tree and Dollar General I
[6932.44s] think they&#39;re going to recover uh and I
[6934.719s] think it&#39;s going to make time I love the
[6936.56s] fact that they&#39;re beat down over the
[6937.84s] Tariff fears because they&#39;re going to be
[6939.4s] worse than advertised uh better than
[6941.52s] advertised rather than less less bad uh
[6944.88s] njd I think that um
[6960.079s] uh
[6963.48s] JD JD&#39;s fine but I&#39;d rather play it
[6967.159s] through Baba because they&#39;ve got the
[6968.44s] cloud business
[6970.199s] so um leave it there uh next question
[6974.52s] comes from thanks miles
[6983.44s] Alex
[7000.88s] Ward uh trmd which is a
[7004.04s] shipper shipping companies are
[7008.56s] garbage um
[7022.4s] very
[7030.0s] cyclical we had a nice move on front
[7032.76s] line at one point
[7036.32s] I this is a tough business I mean
[7039.04s] honestly if you&#39;re gonna go into
[7040.04s] shipping you&#39;re best to buy the ships
[7041.48s] when there&#39;s a glut and wait for the
[7044.56s] cycle to tighten but um that&#39;s not what
[7047.719s] we do I&#39;ll take a quick look for you
[7050.599s] but it&#39;s a good way to lose a lot of
[7052.76s] money is buying shipper
[7057.239s] equities I remember all the people
[7059.719s] Lemmings chasing Zim shipping and it was
[7062.48s] going to go up
[7063.76s] forever and um it collapsed
[7076.079s] Fleet of product tankers in the
[7089.0s] UK see these land Banks and shipping
[7092.8s] companies these are the things
[7095.52s] that people confuse as quality value
[7099.52s] investing versus deep value or special
[7102.199s] situations and this type of deep value
[7104.079s] stuff is what gives value investing a
[7106.04s] bad name because people get bagged in
[7107.76s] this
[7108.599s] stuff for 10 years and it never does
[7112.079s] anything
[7116.36s] um I generally wouldn&#39;t touch a shipper
[7120.079s] unless it&#39;s really like a like a 2009
[7123.199s] bottom cycle and I&#39;m pretty confident
[7125.44s] that they&#39;re not going to go bankrupt I
[7127.639s] understand what you&#39;re seeing here I&#39;m
[7129.119s] just telling you
[7130.719s] that there
[7132.88s] ways to lose a lot of money shippers are
[7136.079s] are one miners are another this this
[7138.76s] does look like it&#39;s getting better but
[7140.52s] to your point you say that Howard marks
[7142.52s] is currently the main shareholder in
[7144.239s] selling large chunks of stock which are
[7146.52s] affecting the share price so he doesn&#39;t
[7148.88s] need to sell why is he selling what does
[7150.52s] he know that you don&#39;t know and I don&#39;t
[7152.76s] I generally don&#39;t want to be on the
[7154.04s] other side of a trade with Howard marks
[7155.88s] which is why it interests me that Howard
[7158.32s] marks is buying the hell out of China um
[7161.639s] why d peer buying the hell out of China
[7166.36s] so uh higher and better uses I think
[7169.56s] your thinking framework Alex got you to
[7171.92s] a good place I just think you&#39;re in the
[7173.44s] wrong sector to play that game even if
[7175.96s] the stock price goes up it&#39;s like you&#39;re
[7178.8s] in a sector where the odds are against
[7180.92s] you to win from a historical standpoint
[7183.92s] you get lucky from time to time and make
[7185.8s] multi-baggers but uh you&#39;ll give it back
[7188.32s] to the casino because it&#39;s it&#39;s an
[7190.8s] unsound uh place to allocate
[7194.719s] Capital Sophie have you looked at wind
[7197.32s] Resorts new UAE project seems like it
[7200.119s] would get a boost from the
[7202.0s] company
[7204.8s] um when is a China
[7208.52s] play
[7211.76s] we&#39;re playing it through
[7214.4s] Baba I think it&#39;s okay here I don&#39;t
[7216.88s] think you&#39;re going to get an easy double
[7218.36s] and we prefer doubles and triples that
[7220.159s] are pretty easy and pretty predictable
[7223.0s] with the risk being time and irr that
[7226.84s] doesn&#39;t really
[7228.28s] qualify um but it&#39;s a good company
[7232.079s] um Greg says thanks for the analysis on
[7235.639s] diio I&#39;ve been working on opco what do
[7238.0s] you think I think it&#39;s a I think it&#39;s a
[7240.32s] garbage spec play that only has any
[7244.04s] credibility because Phil Frost has been
[7246.04s] dumping tons of money in it for years
[7248.199s] and years and years uh and Phil Frost
[7250.679s] started tea and he was an investor major
[7253.28s] investor at the first hedge fund that I
[7255.119s] worked at and he&#39;s a super smart guy and
[7258.119s] he&#39;s made a ton of money and this thing
[7260.44s] he&#39;s been bagged in for literally 16 17
[7263.8s] years buying it up at 19 buying it down
[7265.92s] at a dollar so he obviously thinks it
[7268.56s] can work he&#39;s one of the smartest Minds
[7270.119s] in biotech so you have to gamble on if
[7272.88s] he is he going to be right in the next
[7274.04s] 18 days or is he going to be right in
[7275.96s] the next 18 years and I have no Edge on
[7279.199s] that which is why we own xbi and we&#39;ll
[7281.04s] take our simple over a few years and uh
[7284.48s] be Off to the Races but this
[7286.48s] thing tell me what your Edge is and I&#39;ll
[7288.76s] tell you whether you should be involved
[7290.32s] and uh uh for me there I have no Edge on
[7294.92s] that one Tim Ted
[7297.96s] do um this is one of the covid Darlings
[7301.079s] that&#39;s probably starting to show signs
[7302.679s] of Life everyone&#39;s copying it I don&#39;t
[7305.0s] really know what the mode is Amazon
[7307.44s] tried to get into the business
[7309.719s] everything&#39;s accelerating here
[7315.36s] um PD I mean this is probably
[7321.56s] one let&#39;s take a
[7329.04s] look financials income statement
[7349.04s] H who put this on quarterly that&#39;s why
[7351.4s] okay half of my numbers were off because
[7353.239s] this was switched to quarterly versus
[7354.639s] annual sorry about
[7356.239s] that
[7360.52s] um so revenues are
[7364.48s] decelerating never good on a Momo
[7370.84s] stock free cash flow is
[7381.84s] okay balance sheet 1.2
[7386.079s] billion balance sheets okay
[7408.88s] just don&#39;t understand why they&#39;re losing
[7410.52s] so much uh what is the charge
[7414.159s] that let&#39;s see here
[7441.44s] $2 billion on 300 million of free cash
[7446.599s] flow with flat
[7450.48s] sales
[7452.239s] um look it&#39;s
[7454.88s] obviously more reasonably priced uh the
[7458.199s] key is are there any Catalyst for change
[7462.32s] um let me see what they&#39;re doing with
[7464.04s] the free cash flow are they buying in
[7465.84s] shares or are they issuing
[7476.679s] shares they keep issuing shares or
[7478.92s] giving shares to themselves I mean the
[7480.52s] share counts gone from 42 million to 168
[7483.639s] million these this management is a bunch
[7485.4s] of
[7486.28s] pigs and uh I don&#39;t like that that&#39;s
[7490.52s] just a warning sign for me they they
[7492.199s] have no respect for Equity so I&#39;d look
[7495.48s] at it and just see what is the
[7497.44s] competition from other players in the
[7499.28s] market it might be cheap enough but any
[7501.679s] management that does this to the Share
[7503.199s] account I have zero respect for so I&#39;m
[7507.36s] not going to be involved with operators
