Etsy has been left for dead Etsy was a covid darling the stock is down 85% but what most people don't realize it's the third most trafficed retail website 92 million users and what's really interesting about that Brian is that they don't compete it's not a race to the bottom on prices because the things you can get on Etsy you can get nowhere else and this is a company that while the stock is down 85% they've been able to maintain all the users they picked up during covid and maintain the free cash flow generation is reaccelerating 600 million plus trailing 12 months a billion doll buyback authorization growth in international growth in men's growth in gifting growth in loyalty programs we like this one\n\naccelerated from negative aggregate earnings growth to positive and by early next year they will be low double digits to Mid teen so you want to follow the earnings and uh and the unmagnify I think that's where you're going to see things happen. I think the biggest surprise of 2025 is going to be that bonds get bid okay we've seen since bessent Scott bessent was appointed as treasury secretary uh and he put in his 333 plan the 3% real GDP budget deficits below 3% and add 3 million barrels per day uh bonds have come yields have come in so that's an opportunity to buy a little longer out on the curve as for stocks as for Christmas presents I got a perfect one for you actually maybe two if we have time I've got Etsy. Etsy has been left for dead Etsy was a covid darling the stock is down 85% but what most people don't realize it's the third most trafficed retail website 92 million users and what's really interesting about that Brian is that they don't compete it's not a race to the bottom on prices because the things you can get on Etsy you can get nowhere else and this is a company that while the stock is down 85% they've been able to maintain all the users they picked up during covid and maintain the free cash flow generation is reaccelerating 600 million plus trailing 12 months a billion doll buyback authorization growth in international growth in men's growth in gifting growth in loyalty programs we like this one. concerns about um that it hasn't maintained that level of specialness right that there are counterfeit Goods on there that it's not as curated Etc what do you think about that do you think etsy's been doing a good job of sort of addressing some of those concerns no and yes no they haven't been doing a good job that's why the stock's down 85% yes they recognize the mistakes they made and they're fixing it and that's why we're seeing a re acceleration of growth revenues proper initiatives curation and uh and an abandonment of what they were doing which was trying to compete with people that they don't compete with. Julie and I were having a chat on on tech stocks and uh seeing some weakness in the semiconductor names is there any read through any cautionary signs from some of these stocks that were some of the favorites amongst investors now getting tossed in the trash well as it relates to Nvidia we we saw a lot of retail uh investors Chase into that after the split uh they got some benefits but you know at the end of the day you have a stock that's priced for Perfection trading at some 40 times sales 40 times forward earnings a lot has to go right and the problem is there was a period in time when Nvidia the stock price went up and it actually got cheaper because the multiple went down that is no longer the case because profit margins have Tapped Out uh Revenue growth has capped out at a measly $4 billion doar a quarter which is still absolutely incredible but uh the key is price is what you pay value is what you get and at 40 time sales as we move from training the models which is where gpus are the most critical and the spend for gpus is the most important thing two the more efficient part of the AI process which we're slowly shifting into which is inference inference can be done on more basic chips with lower energy use lower demand uh more chips but lower quality chips that's where the amds of the world and the intels of the world are going to start to arise from the dead and the and the p is going to be split up a little bit better so uh on that basis maybe they can e out a couple more quarters of stock growth but uh where it's priced I think uh it's it's certainly makes sense that it's consolidating and stalling a little bit and maybe even pulling back. I want to come back to your bond call because I find that kind of interesting Tom because there are of of course all this talk about tariffs maybe keeping rates meaning the inflation's going to stay higher meaning that rates are going to stay higher for longer we're not going to see as many Cuts how does that factor into what you're expecting well this was the exact same thing that happened in Trump 1.0 he was elected in November of 2016 the first thing you saw was oh it's going to be inflationary he's going to spend he's the debt king or the you know the bond King uh and and immediately uh long end of the curb sold off aggressively after the election and into his inauguration and it was kind of sell the rumor by the news when he actually got in bonds had a meaningful rally in 2017 same thing with the dollar as soon as he was elected it had this knee-jerk strength all the way into January into the inauguration and then weakness and I think those are going to be two big surprises in 2025 bonds get bid yields compressed dollar actually re weakens maybe not the next few weeks but as you look out six to nine months that will be the case and if you look at the inflation during the Trump 1.0 Administration it was subdued there were a lot of different conditions I'll give you that history does not repeat it does rhyme but the other thing that was odd about uh uh 2017 to 2020 is uh Emerging Markets did exceptionally well when he was a pro tariff the tarff king he ran on the Tariff King and Emerging Markets had really tremendous rallies as the dollar weakened so I would be open-minded and the other thing that people think energy is going to do great energy did very poorly under the Trump Administration and so did retail stocks after initial rally into the inauguration retail stocks were very weak in that first year probably on the fear of tariffs as well so uh I would just be burdened by the facts and the data versus the hearsay of what might happen or perceptions about what would happen look at what actually happened and see where the conditions are similar and where they might be different and I think there's a tremendous opportunities in the next 12 months in doing that.\n\nand I think those are going to be two big surprises in 2025 bonds get bid yields compressed dollar actually re weakens maybe not the next few weeks but as you look out six to nine months that will be the case and if you look at the inflation during the Trump 1.0 Administration it was subdued there were a lot of different conditions I&#39;ll give you that history does not repeat it does rhyme but the other thing that was odd about uh uh 2017 to 2020 is uh Emerging Markets did exceptionally well when he was a pro tariff the tarff king he ran on the Tariff King and Emerging

Administration and so did retail stocks after initial rally into the inauguration retail stocks were very weak in that first year probably on the fear of tariffs as well so uh I would just be burdened by the facts and the data versus the hearsay of what might happen or perceptions about what would happen look at what actually happened and see where the conditions are similar and where they might be different and I think there&#39;s a tremendous opportunities in the next 12 months in doing that\n### QUOTES_OF_THE_WEEK\n\n### QUOTES_OF_THE_WEEK\n\nBenjamin Graham individuals who cannot Master their emotions are ill suited to profit from the investment process look at Market fluctuations as your friend rather than your enemy profit from Folly rather than participated that&#39;s from Warren Buffett we&#39;re going to talk about some of that Folly today Peter Lynch everyone has the brain power to make money in stocks not everyone has the stomach if you are susceptible to selling everything in a panic you ought to avoid stocks and mutual funds all together\n### QUOTES_OF_THE_WEEK\nlook at fluctuations as your friend rather than your enemy for instance today gxo Logistics uh that thing had traded up you know we were talking about it in the low 50s and high 40s on this uh podcast for a while and then it just shot up to the low 60s on rumors that the company was going to get bought out at whatever 25% premium and everyone was so excited I said that&#39;s the worst thing that could ever happen to us as investors I didn&#39;t get into this to make 10 or 20 or $30 which would be you know $30 if they got it they probably would have taken it at 80 uh which would have been a 60% gain which would have meant we had to pay pay ordinary income taxes on a gain much lower than our expected value of the business over the next 3 years and uh and I voic my concern uh to the company I said look if you&#39;re not getting 80 this is a dumb deal and I&#39;m really surprised that it would even be considered\n### FEATURED_COMPANY_DEEP_DIVES\nand we own a position in qxo and we own a position uh in gxo uh a big position which got a lot bigger this morning so um I&#39;m pretty excited about that I usually don&#39;t buy on the first day down I&#39;ll probably be be able to top up a little more than next few days but um I&#39;m super excited that they didn&#39;t sell it and I&#39;m more excited that I was able to get more people more positioning uh where available uh across the accounts today and take advantage of that opportunity and that&#39;s what we talk about looking at the market fluctuations as your friend rather than your enemy more people probably sold it uh because all the people were in for hot money to make five bucks on a deal and they got smoked which I&#39;m super happy about uh we don&#39;t need those own type of owners in the business and mastering the emotions who would buy a stock that gets pounded in a day other than turnaround Tom uh and in some accounts we were actually able to some we we were able to pick up some shares in the uh below 51 today uh in which case in some accounts we brought down the basis which was pretty excited and uh and some below 52 some below 51 uh but look anything below 100 I think in this stock over the next three years is going to be a bargain so excited about that um here are some of the indicators so yeah we&#39;re stretched but you know you look at the extremes we&#39;re not really at the extremes before a crash we are at levels of enthusiasm you see during bull markets and honestly we haven&#39;t had a protracted one for some time\n### MACRO_DATA_SLIDES\nlook at materials in healthc care which we&#39;re going to talk a little bit about today number one biotech we&#39;ve owned we talked about we love that that&#39;s going to be huge in 2025 uh and uh healthc care uh materials albam Marl we&#39;re going to talk about today that was down today it&#39;s funny in my article I wrote you know it wasn&#39;t as big of a position as we would like because when we were putting it on several months ago and we talked about on the podcast uh one there was a limit where we had capacity we were pretty fully invested\n### TECHNICAL_CHARTS\nArc we talked about a few weeks ago we said watch out she&#39;s going to be like a phoenix From the Ashes was weak after the election in 2016 took off 2017 and she starting to take off Baba what did it do after Trump got elected in 16 kept selling down which is what it&#39;s been doing before the inauguration on January 1 as soon as the calendar year turned and the tax loss selling was done went straight up and never looked back from $84 to $187 in 11 months uh I think we could see a similar repeat of that and I think that&#39;s going to be one of the most shocking trades for 2025 the other shocking trade is that bonds are going to get bid let&#39;s we&#39;ll show you some of these other things momentum stocks did did well uh um small caps we covered China stock same thing as Baba traded all the way down after Trump got elected right before he got inaugurated straight up and never looked back double in uh 11 months and that&#39;s an index by the way equal weighted did fine uh semiconductors did fine uh S&P 500 just ground higher so I mean you look at this situation strong after the election with Trump then a little grind iness in December and January and February and then it just kept pushing higher we&#39;ll see we&#39;ll see on that on the indices uh solar again you know sold off after Trump got elected after the inauguration again choppy for a few months and then started to take back off I think solar is going to do a lot better under Trump than it did under Biden which is counterintuitive uh biotech same story a little weakness after the election a lot of strength uh after the inauguration\n### MISCELLANEOUS\nmaterials same thing we want more materials exposure we&#39;ll talk about Alam Maro on that today and uh hopefully we get another few bad days on Alam Maro so we can make it a real position but um uh Today Was a Good Start uh XLE same thing people think it&#39;ll be strong probably won&#39;t be as strong as people think certainly in that first year financials they&#39;ve moved up a lot I think they&#39;re going to be more sideways than up in the short term and probably second half when that IPO machine uh cranks will be better\n\niness in December and January and February and then it just kept pushing higher we&#39;ll see we&#39;ll see on that on the indices uh solar again you know sold off after Trump got elected after the inauguration again choppy for a few months and then started to take back off I think solar is going to do a lot better under Trump than it did under Biden which is counterintuitive uh biotech same story a little weakness after the election a lot of strength uh after the inauguration um servicers uh were weak everyone thinks they&#39;re going to be strong on Trump I&#39;m still going to hold my comso resources I mean unless the thing went to like 40 and two minutes I I I&#39;m going to hold that one for the long term materials same thing we want more materials exposure we&#39;ll talk about Alam Maro on that today and uh hopefully we get another few bad days on Alam Maro so we can make it a real position but um uh Today Was a Good Start uh XLE same thing people think it&#39;ll be strong probably won&#39;t be as strong as people think certainly in that first year financials they&#39;ve moved up a lot I think they&#39;re going to be more sideways than up in the short term and probably second half when that IPO machine uh cranks will be better ### MISCELLANEOUS\nindustrial same story Tech little bumpy then ground higher they&#39;ll be fine uh Staples we&#39;re going to find some opportunities probably in the next few weeks to get some Staples exposure utility same story down after Trump was elected why because bonds spiked and then um same thing with Healthcare I think healthcare is going to be the opportunity of a lifetime got smoked after he got elected ripped higher after the inauguration consumer discretionary uh exploration production spiked after elected collapsed after inaugurated uh retail same story spiked after elected collapse after inaugurated it it it&#39;s not necessarily going to repeat but it is going to rhyme but the most important one which I don&#39;t know why was not in there is  TLT okay so sold off big which means yields went up after Trump was elected we had the same thing now and then slightly before the inauguration and then a little choppiness after but the whole following year bonds got bid yields compressed I think that&#39;s going to be the biggest surprise the other thing that&#39;s going to be a big surprise the two biggest surprises are yields down and US dollar down look what happened after Trump got elected in 2016 rallied like crazy into January 1 and then collapsed his whole first year of the presidency expect that and what does that do it sends China Emerging Markets through the roof Emerging Markets as the dollar spiked after the election Emerging Markets fell peaked at on Jan one and rolled over Emerging Markets Off to the Races um so that&#39;s that all right let&#39;s go through our data materials again is this oh okay this was a quote from one of Warren Buffett&#39;s letters that I was reading through and I thought it was appropriate to talk about today he said we select our marketable Equity Securities in much the same way we would evaluate a business for acquisition in its entirety we want the business to be number one one that we can understand number two with favorable long-term prospects and number three uh operated by honest and competent people and\n\n### MACRO_DATA_SLIDES\nhere is  TLT okay so sold off big which means yields went up after Trump was elected we had the same thing now and then slightly before the inauguration

and rolled over Emerging Markets Off to the Races um so that&#39;s that\n### QUOTES_OF_THE_WEEK\nall right let&#39;s go through our data materials again is this oh okay let&#39;s get to the top here okay this was a quote from one of Warren Buffett&#39;s letters that I was reading through and I thought it was appropriate to talk about today he said we select our marketable Equity Securities in much the same way we would evaluate a business for acquisition in its entirety we want the business to be number one one that we can understand number two with favorable long-term prospects and number three uh operated by honest and competent people and finally  four available at a very attractive price and most people continue to forget number four price is what you pay value is what you get you know you can get distracted ra raed by seeing the shiny objects and all the yahoos chasing the winners and they look great in the short term and then when they get smoked and the company the Momo company hits a misses a quarter and the stock&#39;s down 40% in a matter of days uh you just don&#39;t hear from them for three months they disappear some never come back most never come back some come back and they act like it never happened and eventually people forget but um that&#39;s not what we do so uh um you know to my friend&#39;s point it&#39;s basically like Buffett&#39;s talking about here what would we be willing to pay for the entire business and feel like we got a deal uh we ordinarily make no attempt to buy equities for anticipated favorable stock price behavior in the short term in fact if their business&#39;s experience continues to satisfy us we welcome lower market prices of stocks we own as an opportunity to acquire even more of a good thing at a better price and that&#39;s what we do every single week and you know for those companies that take off faster than we want we&#39;re often disappointed that we didn&#39;t get an opportunity to size into it uh because it ran away from us than enthusiastic that it got to our intrinsic value faster than than we wanted it to uh what Buffett&#39;s saying\n\nfour available at a very attractive price and most

faster than we want we&#39;re often disappointed that we didn&#39;t get an opportunity to size into it uh because it ran away from us than enthusiastic that it got to our intrinsic value faster than than we wanted it to uh what Buffett&#39;s saying here is  our experience has been that prata portions of truly outstanding businesses sometimes sell in the Securities Market markets at very large discounts from the prices they would command in negotiated transactions involving the entire companies consequently Bargains and business ownership which simply are not available directly through corporate acquisition can be obtained indirectly through stock ownership when prices are appropriate we are willing to take very large positions in selected companies not with any intention of taking control and not foreseeing sellout or merger but with the expectation that excellent business results by corporations will translate over the long term into correspondingly excellent market value and dividend results for our owners minority as well as majority today&#39;s a perfect example with gxo Logistics and even albam Maro and even Intel by the way although you can argue Intel is not a great business I beg to differ and we&#39;ll explain a little bit reasons why uh today but um uh gxo you had all these people bidding it up at you know from 48 to 63 thinking they were going to deal get a deal at 65 or 70 and I was surprised that that management even entertained a deal because they have such a unique position in that market and such an oligopolistic uh situation with DHL basically duopolistic in a fragmented business they can roll up tons of more businesses uh and just control the thing and um uh so anyway I&#39;m glad they\n\n### MISCELLANEOUS\nexperience has been that prata

just control the thing and um uh so anyway I&#39;m glad they finally\n\n### MISCELLANEOUS\nfinally\n\ncame to the right conclusion and I guess look at $80 or $90 they would have had to consider it I just don&#39;t think that was on the table and to even have a meeting over 60 you know one of the there are two primary criteria that turnaround Tom has when he&#39;s going into a business number one is if I were to get financed by JP Morgan to buy 100% of the company uh at these prices that are quoted in the public markets and I presented that to the board uh would the board ask security to remove me from the premises because they thought I was absolutely a Looney Tune and I&#39;m looking to buy great businesses at Looney Tune prices which the public markets Mr Market it&#39;s manic depressive if you read Benjamin Graham&#39;s intelligent investor uh serves these up and and if the board would not have me escorted off the premises because my order off was ridiculous I.E the price that it&#39;s quoted in the public markets uh then I&#39;m less interested uh and number two if this position goes to zero will they take me out on the on a stretcher and that has to also be no meaning it&#39;s not sized in a way that it has a terminal effect if there&#39;s something that I don&#39;t know that I don&#39;t know uh and usually the lower expected value return the higher the certainty and the ability to size up so if the expected value on an investment is a double over two to three to four years it&#39;s probably got a high degree of certainty business and it&#39;s uh low risk in terms of balance sheet in terms of cyclicality in terms of uh newness I have data through many many cycles I have confidence in management so I can make it big size with a relatively reasonable expect Ed return 30 plus% irr um uh maybe higher if it happens faster maybe a little lower but over a basket of 10 to 12 uh I can hit my targets um and uh and the ones that have the higher expected returns of 3x 5x 10x because they&#39;re so pounded and I&#39;m looking for some refinance Catalyst or some cyclical adjustment and a highly operating leveraged business uh then I have to size it accordingly you know that&#39;s not going to be a Max siiz position uh if there&#39;s a possibility because if you know if you get taken out on a 15% position it&#39;s you know it&#39;s going to take a a year to make that back from the other eight or 10 positions so you don&#39;t ever want to be in that position uh so that&#39;s got to be sized down but if the expected value is eight or 10x uh even a five to six to 7% position is a material contributor over three or four years so that&#39;s kind of a little bit about how I think about it but it was interesting to see this explanation from Buffett that effectively embodies how I think about it and which I probably learned from him which I learned most of the things I learned from him ### HEADLINES_AND_NEWS stocks tend to do well in the December of an election year this is from Ryan Dietrich over at Carson so 83% positivity rate 1.3% average gains December is historically solid month uh past 20 years up uh you know one in change an election year up even more since 1950 up even more so all these things point to a positive December don&#39;t bet against it average return after the Market&#39;s up 20% year-to date is 2.4% uh junk to treasury bond spreads no concerns of risk uh I would just say that you know you often when when volatility initially comes down this low and people present this as a reason to say watch out we&#39;re at the top you often have multiple bumps along the bottom before you get the next Spike I mean and this is a bad sample it&#39;s only 24 years but like even dot you had this crazy Spike like you had with covid but then you get this one roll over again and that&#39;s kind of halfway through the rally just like we got this one roll over about halfway through the rally and and you keep going you know here it went for four plus years here we about two years into it um same thing with uh 2011 you got this huge Spike during the financial crisis on the vix uh treasury bond spreads no concerns of risk then you get this uh After Shock in 2011 just like you got in 2022 which by the way it&#39;s funny in 2022 I a friend who was saying that&#39;s it look at credit spreads and I said that happens every cycle this is an Aftershock and I remember on the podcast talking about these and he went all to cash and you know he claims that he was buying it anyway it is what it is and um and then it rolled back over and then you still had multiple years and you had one more Spike so I think you probably have another one probably in the midterm election year if I had to guess and that&#39;s when I&#39;d start to get a little bit more cautious and and harvesting a lot of the things that were in all items Consumer Price Index 12- month change so that&#39;s been oh this is interesting so this is from 1914 to 1929 ladies and gentlemen which is the Once in a 100y year event the Spanish Flu 1917 1918 you had this huge spike in inflation two years later it collapsed like we&#39;ve been seeing the last uh 12 months uh Rose a little bit and then just stayed level all the way through 1929 and I think this is kind of the base case it&#39;ll be a little more elevated from here and it&#39;ll probably stay that way uh till the end of the the decade and um and the other interesting thing about these comparisons like the Roaring 20s and I talk a lot about it on the podcast is you had the same type of demographic benefit where you had a large segment of the population at housing formation years in the 20s so some people think it was because the Spanish flu and the aftermarket the roaring 20 some think it was because of the automobile but I think demographics also had a lot to do with it very similar to uh what we&#39;re seeing now and if you look at like 1910 through uh 1930 again like another 18 to 20 year secular bull you had that young population so we were about halfway through I think we&#39;re about you know a little bit more than halfway through here if you consider probably since 2009 so probably at least another 6 seven8 years in this bull run and that&#39;s what it&#39;s going to look like the last 6 seven8 years in terms of inflation a little elevated and that&#39;ll bring down debt to GDP like we saw post World War II December rarely is the worst month of the year uh this is from Seth golden I&#39;ve not seen retail rail traffic data this ridiculous head strong in recession slowdown ever uh so he&#39;s yeah he&#39;s basically talking about what we&#39;ve been talking about for several months which is very hard to have a recession when you have rail traffic that strong corporate insiders are stock sales reach all-time high this is another thing people are pointing to to say the rally is over uh I think the smart way to look at this is that corporate insiders are often very early uh you know if you look here they were three years early selling at this level in 2004 that often happens because they&#39;re stuck in recency bias like they remember three years ago how bad things were this is like their way to get out at you know pre-pandemic levels or whatever it happens to be uh and I think they&#39;re going to be early this time as well not all companies some are going to be right uh maybe Jensen will be right selling a billion dollars a stock on the retail investors but uh the rest of them uh were way too early 2012 2003 uh and it just keeps going 2016 etc etc ### HEADLINES_AND_NEWS JD Power November new vehicle sales expected to Surge to 16.5 million SAR consumer spending to reach highest level ever for November that&#39;s from a few days ago um projected to reach 1.36 million a 6.7% increase from November 2023 on a selling day adjusted basis that&#39;s a forecast from JD Power and the seasonally adjusted annualized rate for total new vehicle sales is expected to be 16.5 million ladies and gentlemen if we get 16.5 for a year I think Cooper standard could earn potentially at 16.5 more than it earned in 2017 on 17.1 meaning greater than seven bucks a share so put whatever multiple you want on it the worst multiple was 10 when they were making money the best multiple was 20 we love it uh and we don&#39;t have anything else to say about it 6,000 is here now what this is from trick 12 months later after major Milestones average up 88.6% I think that makes a lot of sense I think that would be the right number for 2024 for the S&P to be up 8.6 it wouldn&#39;t surprise me if it was up 12.6 wouldn&#39;t surprise me if it was up 7.6 it would surprise me if it was up 19.6 I&#39;ll leave it at that monthly return stats for the S&P 500 and by the way that&#39;s the that is the type of environment where we mint money uh monthly return stats for S&P 500s 1964 to 2023 December had the highest positivity ratio behind uh April average return 1.3% which is the third highest after November and April real consumer spending Trends Services going up non- durable goods durable goods durable goods that&#39;s cars Etc Canada&#39;s exports the US Energy is a huge export to the US uh China manufacturing going up no one&#39;s talking about it that&#39;s fine they will after they after the fact these are good numbers ladies and gentlemen economic China mrb economic activity indicator off the charts uh composite PMI inflecting upward no one&#39;s talking about it India&#39;s economy slows sharply adding pressure on Central Bank to cut rates people couldn&#39;t get enough India at the exact wrong time couldn&#39;t sell China exact wrong time we&#39;re going to see an inflection in both India down China up S&P equal weighted 12mon forward PE again right at the average Point here at 18 times relative to the S&P at 22 times um S&P to TLT ratio stocks to bonds at a range Peak more than 2.7 standard deviations above the mean bonds up big surprise for 2025 bonds up yields down market cap weighted underperform Tech weighted underperform broadening Market other sectors earnings growth accelerating outperform next year small cap same thing uh sells side Equity sentiment again elevated not extreme great financial crisis pushed stock allocations below the traditional 60 to 65% ban so for everyone talking about households rushing into stocks they&#39;re still not nearing anywhere near um certainly not the tech highs and certainly not the pre-financial crisis highs we&#39;re still stock at 57% and the mean is probably around 59 to 60% and Peaks were 71% so putting it in perspective bull bear indicator at 4.7 again doesn&#39;t really point to uh acute top Bank of America projects near 100 basis points of policy easing in 2025 I will take the under on that I I well let me see all right confidence surges among small business owners so I don&#39;t have to go after that let let&#39;s see what the coin flip odds are after Powell spoke today for December uh very interesting the odds shot up today for 78% chance of a cut in December if he does that I think he can be done for a while I think that would be the right move I think that he could potentially do nothing until at least March and then maybe from there two more cuts and done if that take it down to four maybe Max 375 uh and that&#39;s all he&#39;s going to need biggest underperformance of Europe versus the us since 1976 what happened next biggest outperformance of Europe versus the US this is no different than um Emerging Markets the same thing you are going to see this inflect and what&#39;s going to be the catalyst is the same thing you saw in the 70s and the same thing you saw in the periods where it outperformed is that the terminal rate is much higher than the previous cycle and with a terminal rate at 375 or four uh value and xus outperform and we&#39;re going to see the same thing this if you don&#39;t take this bet US Stocks very exceptional relative to European equities uh some probably four standard deviations above the mean uh then you just you know God bless you I mean uh but I don&#39;t know how to put this I mean it&#39;s not saying bet 100% on this but if you see an extreme like this and you don&#39;t take five or 10 or 15% of your portfolio and expose yourself somehow to the reversion of the mean instead you chase four standard deviations up uh number one you&#39;re begging for a reaming and number two uh you&#39;re missing a generational opportunity to make obscene amounts of money in a short period of time and look you can be wrong if you&#39;re on margin is where you&#39;ll get hurt if you&#39;re not on margin and it takes three years longer than you expect to make 10x on that 10% of your portfolio or 15% of your portfolio uh it doesn&#39;t matter the irr is so insane relative to everything else you have to take that bet and if you&#39;re wrong probably all that happens is that was dead money in your portfolio you didn&#39;t lose because you&#39;re buying at such a discount to intrinsic value uh you just didn&#39;t win so you&#39;d have a one or 200 basis points drag on your over overall portfolio but you might have a 150% accretion from that 10% if you did take the bet so those asymmetric bets and I learned that from my years at Cornwall Capital if you watch the movie The Big Short they were masters of asymmetric bets and I learned a lot from listening to them and that&#39;s by the way how I got my foot in the door I gave them a short soybeans trade they made 5x in 90 days uh 25 million bucks on a $5 million investment on puts in summer of 2012 uh and um and that&#39;s that so so this is one of those examples of asymmetry yes I know growth is going to be slower yes I know all that but the difference is lagard will probably go down to 1% terminal rate we&#39;re going down to 4% terminal rate and she&#39;ll Juice It Up so I&#39;m not saying bet on Europe I&#39;m saying bet on Emerging Markets but you can find some opportunities there and we we&#39;re making an implicit European bet with gxo for sure India stock funds see largest four-week outflow since June 2022 couldn&#39;t get enough here now it&#39;s rolling over they&#39;re all getting out and that&#39;s going to persist for many years in our vle China discount or India premium India premium in my view forward PE in China 9.8 times forward PE in India 22.58% perform but if you go back a little further China has had periods of outperformance and this is going to revert back and if you don&#39;t understand reversion to the mean 100% wrong business for you in my view um I look I&#39;ve been in this business long enough to watch the Momo guys come in get decapitated uh some rise rise from the dead uh and get another shot like Kathy Woods got smoked uh in the um Tech W in 2000 she came back built a monster business got smoked again but she&#39;s a Survivor and by the way I think she&#39;s gonna have an enormous run the next three to five years so kudos to her uh in some sense and um but very few of the Momo Chasers uh uh get get to chapter two they they chase up they get smoked out and they find another career um whereas the value the biggest risk of the value guys over time the ones that are good uh is that they go through periods of year or two of underperformance relative to the index and then the third year they make it all back in spades because they have a triple digit year and everyone&#39;s like oh my God the irr is 35% a year that&#39;s so amazing blah blah blah but it&#39;s it&#39;s not they&#39;re betting on sure things they&#39;re just playing the time Arbitrage game and the ones who are really good at it don&#39;t use uh meaningful leverage and over time they win and um that&#39;s probably my best advice to all the young people that are listening uh don&#39;t get lured into the shiny object game because it will lead to a short career um or if you do get caught up and make obscene amounts of money in a short period of time take your Chips off the table after your two free drinks and and leave the casino ### HEADLINES_AND_NEWS Bank of America forecasting 124 rate cuts by central banks in 2025 okay so if you&#39;re going to get 124 cuts xus and three Cuts us where do you want to place your bets ladies and gentlemen where the 121 cuts are happening or where the three cuts are happening so again this is um stuff to pay attention to and in those periods where you had these massive Cuts you saw the benefits of xus Emerging Markets during those years you can go back and trace it um okay again from dri S&P returns Final six months went up 10 okay we covered that December

what Tom Lee is saying like we could finish the year at 6,300\n### MACRO_DATA_SLIDES\nmanufacturing Outlook brightens across several US regions we&#39;ve been talking about this theme you look at the uh different Regional manufacturing results we are coming out of the manufacturing recession and that&#39;s going to fuel the next phase of the bull market which has been in a depression manufacturing ISM Manufacturing turning up new orders turning up private construction turning up uh this is interesting ISM Manufacturing PMI has lagged cyclicals uh over defense and that&#39;s going to play Massive catchup on the uh pmis Japan corporate profits rolling over to negative again people couldn&#39;t get enough China and um excuse me people couldn&#39;t get enough India and Japan at the exact wrong time and sure enough rolling over Russell 2000 this actually broke out small caps broke out just beginning uh Global manufacturing PMI turning up from negative so that that points to X us uh biggest exporters interestingly enough uh China exports 3.4 trillion a year we only export two trillion a year Japan shockingly is only 700 billion and India is only 400 billion so uh South Korea is a big exporter that&#39;s why we watch them a lot um and so on it&#39;s good to see that in color uh S&P index around election day you get this pop up then December early pullback whether we&#39;ve seen that already I don&#39;t know and then push up and then grind sideways so we&#39;ll see uh federal government spending you can see by category Social Security being the highest health care net interest this they&#39;re going to bring rates down Medicare National Defense income security veterans benefits so we&#39;ll see what VC and uh Elon can do over last four decades November through January has been the strongest period for the Russell 2000 I think that continues December&#39;s been the best month for small relative to large caps I think we&#39;re going to see a follow through on that despite today was led by Tech because CRM said the word Ai and their results and everyone got excited um and OCTA S&P 500 monthly seasonality for all years so here&#39;s a color visual of what we talked about earlier December July April and January are all good months so you know I wouldn&#39;t get too an to sell until mid until the inauguration January 20th is generally where I&#39;d be looking second third fourth week uh for things that are super fully valued for things that are not valued forget this timing nonsense and seasonality nonsense you sell it when it&#39;s when it&#39;s met your targets which you should have discerned before you even got into the position every single position we know where we&#39;re getting out before we get in the only thing that changes that calculus is if the facts change and the fundamentals get better or worse than we anticipated where they&#39;d be three years out uh but we&#39;ve modeled it and we know where where we&#39;re going um and when we want to get there so uh manufacturing PMI oh this is interesting price indicator suggests deflationary pressures eased in November this is China went from negative to positive that&#39;s a big deal same thing with manufacturing PA PMI from contraction to expansion so all the things in the stimulus that people are impatient about are coming through would we like direct consumer stimulus yes they&#39;re going to have another big meeting expectations are so low because every big meeting they the bed maybe this time it&#39;ll be different because no one expects anything here&#39;s Jeffrey H who I was talking about the stock Traders Almanac you should buy one by the way if you don&#39;t have one teach you a lot about seasonality and historical data I think it&#39;s good to have um choppy first half of December before a yearend rally so basically you rise up a little bit on average um through the 10th then weak into the 13th 14th 15th and then the yearend rally called the Santa Claus rally last five seven days of the year job openings rise and more workers quit in sign of improving US Labor Market um so that&#39;s good that was a little bit worrisome and there was another fed speaker out earlier in the week who said the word skip which was a little concerning to me but it seems like Powell put the market at ease today with what he said and now we&#39;ve got the odds but that&#39;s kind of meaningless until we get the jobs number um the initial numbers pointed to a number that&#39;s going to be supportive of doing a cut in De December and I think that would just be really set the stage and after that if you&#39;re asking for a lot more Cuts after that you&#39;re kind of being greedy I think if they frontload them the way they&#39;ve been doing you know one is plenty wait three months see how the data comes in one or two next year and let the let the machine run Wards Automotive US Auto Sales SAR this is at 16.5 what&#39;s really interesting if you if you look at it from like a chared standpoint you can see here in 2017 and 18 it got 18 got up over 18 million according to this data um well that okay that was a monthly but the annual came out at 17.1 Blended because you see they had some months at 16 then shot over 18 so 171 when they earned $719 a share so we just got a month above 165 this is amazing cuz like you know the chartist would say

out from steel thanks to my friends over there I know we&#39;ve got a lot of listeners um so gxo backs away from buyout talks and announces plan CEO retirement next year I thought last week&#39;s was going to be short it was like two hours by the way last week&#39;s was one of the better ones of the year uh this week&#39;s we&#39;ve got so much stuff to cover I I thought it was going to be a half hour call again um retirement next year fundamental thesis unchanged and what they do they talk about multiple on you know 950 of adjusted eida for 2025 uh multiple 11 to 12 times which yields North to 7 $70 a share so they&#39;ve got a 12mon price Target of $74 which is 21 times their 2025 EPS estimate at 345 no change there I think that&#39;s going to surprise to the upside and again I think it&#39;s a $100 stock over the next few years um us light vehicle sales to prize on the high side again in November if you remember September was weak October was great November&#39;s great make car sales great again over the LA over half of borrowing by smaller nonpublic businesses is linked to short-term rates so that&#39;s good for refinancing uh we get another cut I think if you see Cooper standard is going to cash pay their debt this quarter and if they can be cash flow positive in this quarter and you get another cut into year end I think they could Finance the whole slug of debt in the first quarter of next year at advantageous rates and then maybe do it again A year later and uh and then just roll it out to 2030 which we don&#39;t need we need three to four years for this thing to hit if that I mean at the rate things are going we&#39;re going to hit 17 SAR a lot quicker than anticipated and $7 of earnings maybe faster than anticipated and uh you know we understand what kind of businesses is although with the technology ad I think they&#39;re going to smooth out some of the cyclicality but um um anyway very exciting on that one city economic surprising by the way

firing of Ginger but I&#39;m also not against it and the reason I&#39;m not against it well here&#39;s the thing he did do the five no he&#39;s going to complete the five nodes in four years he&#39;s doing exactly what he said he was going to do it wasn&#39;t fast enough for the board [Music] um but there are some serious names in contention and one of the names in contention is a guy named lip buan and lip ban got into a company called Cadence Design cdns in January of 2009 and the stock was down 90% % it dropped from $24 to $242 uh from 2008 to 2009 when he got involved the stock then subsequently and he&#39;s still executive chairman by the way has gone from $242 to $328 under his tenure and I will say oh well he just got in at the bot bottom of the cycle he got lucky that&#39;s not the case because the the business had grinded sideways for the previous 15 years and did nothing so it was this guy getting involved that turned it from a sleepy dead company to a money-making machine from 2009 to 2024 uh with uh basically a 60 no 150 bagger it&#39;s not quite 150 bagger it&#39;s like 125 bagger not saying he&#39;s going to do that for Intel I&#39;m not saying he&#39;s going to be the pick but uh if we could bring in someone that would get the street excited I think when the 18a is done next year and they figure out what they want to be when they grow up with a new CEO uh look I know for certain that the business is worth $45 to $50 on the Legacy business and we&#39;ve said that since day one and we got involved we got a run up to $48 we we made a quick double we got out it came back to $29 we started to reinitiate oh and we got lucky lucky uh we had a chance to buy a ton in the High Teens uh and bring our bases back down for the second run at it and it&#39;ll run back up to 45 at some point and then we&#39;re going to decide is it all that it is just a just another double and we&#39;re out uh or has something changed and they can they become a real player with the big boys and girls and uh take advantage of some of these major trends that are happening over the next five years I think it&#39;s going to be the ladder and I think at 45 we&#39;re going to be hodlers to a lot higher 80 90 100 but but now you&#39;ve got an issue in the short term which is a problem which is now they have to go through a pretend search even if they know who they&#39;re going to do they got to drag it out for couple weeks not a couple weeks a couple of months of indecision about who&#39;s going to be the CEO what&#39;s going to be the next plan so it&#39;s be dead money for a couple of months that&#39;s the downside of Ginger being out the upside is if they liquidate it tomorrow we get all of our money back and probably a couple more bucks um and then the intrinsic value is a double on the Legacy business and um and maybe a five plus bagger if they actually get their head on straight get the right person doing it and the joke is going to be that probably everything gelsinger laid out comes to pass and someone else gets the credit and um and that&#39;ll be fine too so uh so that&#39;s that&#39;s the story on Intel China&#39;s leaders plan to discuss GDP Target and stimulus next week that is on Wednesday closed door Central economic work conference economic targets and stimulus plans for 2025 so you can see they&#39;re doing the same exact Playbook that they did in 2016 after the inauguration they weaken the Yuan and they say okay put on another 10% tariffs we&#39;ll just lower the value of our currency by another 10% and have no net effect on our economy uh and then after he gets inaugurated then you know the the game gets back on Trump looks good has noet effect on China because they&#39;ve lowered their currency against it and then the tariffs wind up being less the Yuan appreciates the dollar weekends and We&#39;re Off to the Races with emerging markets in China same story different year Alibaba Cloud aims high in Southeast Asia in 2025 with new AI Partners they&#39;re dominating Indonesia Thailand other markets CEOs are getting tossed out at a record Pace that is the opportunity for us we love it in Intel we love it in Advanced Auto Parts we love it in PayPal by the way which no one&#39;s talking about we love it in Boeing we love it in um I mean it&#39;s it&#39;s almost turnaround Tom&#39;s Playbook I mean every company I get involved in is the new CEO we love it in uh Este louder we&#39;re getting a new CEO um what else what are we missing here gener did it with the same CEO Cooper sard&#39;s going to do it with the same CEO uh um gxo is going to get a new CEO that that&#39;s that&#39;s good um and what else anyway so that&#39;s a good thing that&#39;s a catalyst for change especially when they get the right guys in there like Alex Chris like Shane o Kelly like so many others that we&#39;ve talked about uh Intel considers Outsiders for CEO including Marvel&#39;s head Marvel said no but lip Buu ton for my money that would be the miracle Choice uh makes two to much sense they won&#39;t do it but look when you have 65 and 85% of certain markets look they&#39;ve worked overtime to try to screw it up but it&#39;s very hard to destroy that and um if they can get someone with a pulse and a heartbeat in uh and catch a catch the next Cy upgrade cycle it&#39;s going to make a lot of money even if they&#39;ve got you know basically a weekend up Joe Biden could run the company and it would it would recover back to 45 I don&#39;t know if it would recover back I don&#39;t know if it would go to 80 or 90 on the new plan but he could run it uh and it would definitely rebound back to 4045 so that that tells you everything you need to know gxo spurns acquisition offers as CEO Wilson steps down\n\n### TECHNICAL_CHARTS\nhere&#39;s the chart several months ago we discussed a new position in albam Maro basis 9322 it&#39;s not a large uh position yet because of the time of initiation there was limited excess uninvested Capital to put to work as new capital came in price ran away from us we don&#39;t buy up we do think we will get additional opportunities to size up this position as more data comes in maybe today we didn&#39;t add yet today but we I&#39;d like to see it back in the 90s before I started to look to size up um but if not we&#39;re okay with what we have Alam Maro is in keeping with our theme to find more materials exposure in 2025 as the sector has been decimated and earnings growth is expected to recover handsomely estimates are for 18.9% earnings growth uh up from 18.7 just a few months ago for 2025 Alba Mar&#39;s primary business is lithium production we can see below the Stock&#39;s most recent Spike and collapse in price from 21 to 24 correlates with the spike and drop of the price of lipian carbonate so car lithium carbonate ripped higher collapsed albam Maro stock price ripped higher collapsed I I generally avoid commodity stocks for this very reason basically because you got to get two things right you got to get the commodity right and you got to get the company operations right um that&#39;s with the exception of oil and natural gas stocks when I can buy the commodity cheaper on the New York Stock Exchange than in the fields I learned that tactic from Reading uh John Paul Getty&#39;s legendary book how to be rich highly recommend for everyone however when you look at Alba maro&#39;s long-term price chart the correlation unravels Alba Marl has historically has a moat around its business which when executing at proper levels can mint money irrespective of the price of the underlying commodity so if you look in the short term you see yeah this huge blip that huge blip actually this one was the 2016 to 18 blip uh and this one was the 2020 to 24 blip um but if you go back further then you had like 10 years and you still had a business That Grew From $5 a share to $65 a share with effectively flat lithium carbonate prices China&#39;s appetite for EVS shows no sign of abating even if in North America sales have softened of late if these estimates prove to be 25% true albamar will not not be able to handle all the demand required in coming years reminds me of Boeing Boeing Boeing&#39;s got 10 years of backlog that&#39;s what&#39;s albam Maro is going to be uh based on current trends Bloomberg NF forecast that by 2027 annual Global sales of Passenger EVS will top 30 million rising to 73 million by 20 40 penetration rates will hit 33% in 2027 73% in 2040 I think that&#39;s optimistic between 2024 to 2027 kager is expected to be around 21% a sharp drop from the 20 to 2023 surge EV stock will grow from 41 million at the end of 2023 to 132 Million by 2027 from their lips to God uh Cooper standard has I believe 20 more per Parts capacity on EV than they do on IES so they make 20% more per car but if you look at this when you look at the American part of this uh you can see why we have such a jaded view like we you can&#39;t even see us on this map rest of the world like you can&#39;t even see where America fits in on this growth all the growth is in China and China&#39;s been pushing the EV so if the government&#39;s pushing it just like they&#39;ll push it to over capacity but again where the Arms Dealer so just like we love selling the sealers and the fluid transfer systems and the fuel delivery of Cooper standard to the oems who are going to race to the bottom overproduce and cut margins like it&#39;s going out of style um same thing with the lithium producer albam Maro let them oversupply flood the market with EVS we benefit from all the lithium required to go in and we&#39;re buying it like Buffett said oh in this one four available at a very attractive price that is the key that most people forget um so you can see again it&#39;s it&#39;s all about China EV demand that&#39;s going to that&#39;s going to benefit lithium that&#39;s going to benefit albam Maro and uh uh as the West Begins to acknowledge the recovery in China as it continues to proliferate and sentiment changes everything with any tie into China is going to go through the roof whether that&#39;s Starbucks whether that&#39;s Estee louder whether that&#39;s her whether that&#39;s Nike whether that&#39;s Lulu whether that&#39;s Alibaba whether that&#39;s albam Maro SE louder uh they&#39;re going to go so fast and it&#39;s going to it&#39;s not going to let anyone in so whether that&#39;s the wec meeting and they say we&#39;re going to do 5% GDP and we&#39;re going to do the stimulus to actually get it done uh or it&#39;s the next meeting or who knows uh or it&#39;s just the inflection into January 1 like it was after Trump got elected last time uh it&#39;s really immaterial the key is it&#39;s imminent and what you see here in the long-term Alber uh albam Maro data 2024 was an aberration due to short-term Global lithium overc capacity which is what happens in commodity cyclical businesses but if you look back sales are sales per share are still much higher than 2021 uh approaching 2022 levels next year we&#39;ll be back to 22 levels 2023 was an aberration and you came off the boil so if you draw out the long-term average trend line uh it&#39;s it&#39;s doing fine okay and certainly they got cut off at the kneecaps but the price reflects that so you know you have a stock that dropped from $327 to $71 okay and with huge leverage around the prices of lithium which are at or near historic lows in the short term and the Chinese government is not going to let up on EVS because that puts a lot of people to work that&#39;s their initiative and they&#39;re going to push it uh till the cows come home which is going to help the Chinese economy Chinese manufacturing and it&#39;s going to help albam Maro so um you could see here in the value line estimates they&#39;re expecting a recovery and then a reexpansion out to 2027 2029 but historically you look at this business and the return on Capital has been solid High single digits low double digits for a decade plus return on Equity uh even higher uh net profit solid operating margins in the in the low to mid 20s [Music] um they pay out a little dividend while you wait earnings per share have been growing they peaked in 2022 they&#39;ll recover back uh cash flow per share is hanging in there we&#39;ll be cash flow positive again next year so all the things are in the perfect situation for a turnaround Tom special\n\n### MISCELLANEOUS\nsame CEO Cooper sard&#39;s going to do it with the same CEO uh um gxo is going to get a new CEO that that&#39;s that&#39;s good um and what else anyway so that&#39;s a good thing that&#39;s a catalyst for change

acquisition offers as CEO Wilson steps down uh we covered that are we up to oh wow we&#39;re up to the article of the week all right covered that covered that\n\nd certainly they got cut off at the kneecaps but the price reflects that so you know you have a stock that dropped from $327 to $71 okay and with huge leverage around the prices of lithium which are at or near historic lows in the short term and the Chinese government is not going to let up on EVS because that puts a lot of people to work that&#39;s their initiative and they&#39;re going to push it uh till the cows come home which is

### FEATURED_COMPANY_DEEP_DIVES\n\nand by the way speaking of turnaround Tom specials uh I was going to speak about Etsy on uh claiming countdown today I got bumped till next Tuesday which I&#39;ll be doing live from California for the first time pretty excited to do that um and etsy&#39;s up you know in the blink of an eye again some of these things slow some of them fast from $49 basis to $59 in a matter of weeks uh any fundamental reason for you know 20% plus move in a few weeks no okay uh so it&#39;s just how it works buy good businesses at attractive prices Take the Long View some happen faster some happen slower but over a a book of 10 to 12 good companies you&#39;re going to outperform over time is really what it comes down to uh as so we&#39;ll go through a couple of these bullets because we&#39;ve got a lot of questions  this week as electric vehicle adoption increases we expect double- digit annual growth in global lithium demand generate healthy bromine profits due to its low cost position in the Dead Sea they have the lowest cost um production of bromine uh let&#39;s see here lithium prices will rebound and then remain well above the marginal cost of production to at least the remainder of the decade leading to excess profits and return on invested capital for albam Maro um their Chilean operation is among the world&#39;s lowest cost sources of lithium they have their own salt brine Assets in Chile and the United States and two joint V interests in Australian mines talison green brush bushes and wagina they do the energy storage largest producer one of the world&#39;s largest producers of lithium for battery applications including electric vehicles diverse portfolio of Highly specialized lithium and bromine Solutions and then a lader in refining and petrochemical catalysts they&#39;ve taken a broad set of actions to maintain their long-term competitive position since July and you can see that they&#39;ve hit most of their milestones and they&#39;ve got upside for more they&#39;ve taken a couple hundred million dollar of cost out um and they&#39;re going to get to three to $400 million of cost out they&#39;ve taken their capex down their balance sheet is great they&#39;ve got 3.4 billion of liquidity with $1.7 billion of cash and cash equivalent a $ 1.5 billion revolver so solvency risk is off the table which is a critical thing in turnaround Tom&#39;s checklist of turnarounds uh and um lithium as lithium battery pack prices come down their demand goes up demand out to 2030 you can see here cost advantages resources improving existing resources and accessing non-conventional with direct lithium extraction which will be online next year uh breakthrough OEM opportunities for greater than 50% more EV range with battery material in ation and then the bromine concentration they have in the Dead Sea concentrate in Arkansas is Extreme relative to other places in the world and their industrial cost curve for the elemental bromine is the cheapest in the world where they have the deposits um allocating Capital to the highest return opportunities in sustainability and productivity consistently achieving returns above two times their weighted average cost of capital Target that&#39;s what we like to see the high return on invested Capital over their weighted average cost of capital Global EV demand growth 23% year-to date so we in America it feels like EVS are slowing uh but in China they&#39;re going faster than ever and that&#39;s why you see Elon Musk spending all of his time over in China and focus on China so lithium doesn&#39;t care where it has to go the key is that the overall number in the world is going up and China will be exporting tons of EVS to everywhere in the world except for the United States uh and that will continue to help Alam Maro um so their volumes and energy storage and Specialties were up 16% and 4% respectively jused iov 21 million even in the worst environment cash from operations 241 million and then you can see here the sensitivity to the price of lithium as the price of lithium normalizes the impact on eida you basically get Triple the ebit op for double the price I mean it&#39;s it&#39;s insane uh again this is not fear and greed index not at a level of extreme where you want to get out of everything or even much of anything for that matter ###

tell you how I really feel about European banks with the exception of UBS which is a high quality business that a good friend works at uh but um and ah Deutsche Bank no but but stock CH and B&amp;P uh you couldn&#39;t it&#39;s it&#39;s the worst combination of everything you could ever imagine it&#39;s a cultural cess pool that I want in aggregate there are fantastic people at every Bank individual

deleveraging could be two or 3x I think we looked at this one a few weeks ago and for me uh there was some solvency risk and I don&#39;t really like the business so while you&#39;re probably right um I didn&#39;t want to be involved because there was still solvency risk medical Property Trust mpw I mean I don&#39;t I don&#39;t know where the turnaround comes from the the the free cash flow deterioration shows no end in sight revenues are having I mean this looks like a cigar butt maybe you&#39;ll get one last puff out of it for a trade but unless you can get confidence in the turnaround like what has happened to this business um I think you&#39;re playing with fire let&#39;s take a closer look here so I got 275 million of cash and $9.2 billion of debt I mean yes that debt is secured by assets how much assets we have here 10 billion so you basically got in theory yeah I I don&#39;t like this I think I think you got I&#39;d have to spend a lot of time on it but I think you got close to enough solvency risk and if it&#39;s close to enough and it&#39;s a lower quality business I don&#39;t want to play there even if if the trade could be a double or triple if they pull it off um I think you&#39;re playing with fire here I would avoid even though the trade will probably work in the short term in the long term it&#39;s not a good business um all right so a guy I&#39;m not going to say his name sent me like basically a statement uh um Intel CEO resigns no kidding expected to stay at least until 18a was out the door next year maybe he knows something we don&#39;t he

not going to say his name sent me like basically a statement uh um Intel CEO resigns no kidding expected to stay at least until 18a was out the door next year maybe he knows something we don't he didn't resign he got his ass kicked out the door because the board became impatient because they all want to keep their $300,000 a year jobs for showing up for four meetings that's number one um gouty

it'll be the same with these chips uh so that's a false premise uh in any reasonable time frame in the minute if you read the headlines\n\n### HEADLINES_AND_NEWS\n\nthat&#39;s correct it&#39;s incorrect if you look study anything past a year history uh are Intel&#39;s problems too big to fix by Dan Gallagher in the Wall Street Journal sure Intel is strategic for the US and has defense contracts but it also needs to survive and thrive as a business so that was it he sent a period And I just replied back and I said is there a question or have you already made up your mind and he and he said I wanted to know if you changed your view so first off thank you for listening to our podcast second off thank you for sending a question third nothing&#39;s changed I I honestly don&#39;t think they had to fire gelsinger um but I think there&#39;s a possibility that because they did his planning his plan coming through under a different face will get the stock accelerated much faster than his plan coming through under his own face and I know that sounds silly but there&#39;s sentiment around him and there&#39;s so much failure baked around him with the pro problems that he inherited and couldn&#39;t turn the ship around fast enough that I think even if the ship turned around people wouldn&#39;t believe it uh whereas a new face like the guy I talked about who&#39;s got a huge track record of success when that 18a hits next year and the uh five nodes in four years plays out he&#39;ll get all the credit even though Ginger laid all the foundation and the market will believe it because they&#39;re not looking at all the money they lost under Ginger uh and the hatred they have for that they will be looking at new face new results New outcomes so it may improve prove our irr meaning it will take a lot less time any bit of good news with a new face will be believed and bought whereas any good news under Ginger people would say oh it&#39;s just a fake out this guy loses every time blah blah blah blah blah so uh I think it&#39;ll be a net positive in that regard CK says big fan of the Pod take a look at newor uh I don&#39;t like steel stocks no interest next Jason Z can you look at IM kta this is a special situation this takes a lot longer to look at than five minutes it&#39;s like a land holding m kta real estate company Moonlighting add a commercial Plaza lease operator and grocery stores throughout the Carolinas all right let&#39;s take a look here the balance sheet and see what kind of credit&#39;s given for this 3600 acres of land one half billion dollar 500 million at debt longterm uh let&#39;s see if they&#39;re generating any cash 100 million revenues are growing earnings are growing so I would like to find out what did they make some big acquisition or something to get this earnings jump um I mean there are two businesses I don&#39;t really like supermarket and these kind of like land plays that take 10 years to like St Joe&#39;s and Howard Hughes Corp it&#39;s just just takes forever to work out and it&#39;s just dead money and they hire better uses so I&#39;m going to pass on this one I like the creativity but it&#39;s not for me uh cork asked me to go speak to his students which I probably will in January in California JP would love to hear your thoughts on Pags I know we&#39;ve covered before take another look the new look is no um what&#39;s changed you&#39;re never going to know what Consumer loans are in that on that balance sheet you no way you&#39;re ever going to know so you can gamble on it the trade will probably work cash flow is turning negative price is priced for death um so then you got to do some solv analysis but you really don&#39;t know what you&#39;re holding because of all the off balance sheet Consumer Debt uh and credit receivables and there&#39;s no way you&#39;re going to get transparency on this and keep burning free cash so uh I have any cash 132 million I think it&#39;s I think it&#39;s like more than a coin flip bankruptcy and if it works it&#39;ll go to like 30 so you do asymmetry like that with like 1% 2% position if you lose you lose 2% of your portfolio if you if you win you make 4X so you make 8% total contribution I I just I don&#39;t want to play there ### ASK_ME_ANYTHING_QA Stone energy same story this is from uh Saar we&#39;ve covered this before and the answer was no wait Stone Co rather again negative cash flow you still have a bad government situation in in Brazil I mean if you have to take a bet on one of these two I would take it on Stone Co for sure this one might actually warrant some work so I just want to understand why the cash is getting burned and what&#39;s going to change about that anytime soon they have a decent enough balance sheet that they can withstand some I want to understand like what&#39;s the turnaround situation who is running it when it was at 95 who&#39;s running it now what&#39;s their plan to turn it around this one is probably worth doing some work work um I think Buffett owned it for a minute I don&#39;t think he owns anymore so I want to take a look at this if I want Brazilian exposure this one might be the one to look at but no high conviction there yet Martin schling from Vienna Austria schleig schn uh listening to you for a longer time now already well hopefully future investor uh do for my Austrian holding thank you very much for your insights made really nice profits over the last 18 months already good uh video cast is so much fun to listen in all right uh thank you comp you grab okay c m p u g r o u b got hit it hard ctm let&#39;s see comp you group there it is ealth Services worldwide ambulatory Information Systems impatient software again I mean it&#39;s very tough to tell if they have an actual mode of their business uh let&#39;s take a look it&#39;s been a lowquality business for a lot of years I don&#39;t see why that would change $80 million of cash8 they got 80 million of cash and 800 of long-term debt no bueno cash flow is positive free cash flow and what&#39;s happening with the revenues so they must have done a big acquisition here so it&#39;s a broken covid stock um a lot of these broken covid stocks are coming back like Etsy like PayPal like gener uh so there might be something here uh I think that okay so they named a new CEO in May he was chief officer at the German ealth company prior to the oh he was the CFO so they put the CFO in so you just have to understand his turnaround story and why their software has a an impenetrable Moe uh and that takes a lot more work than just looking at the financials um so first thing you want to start to study is who are their competitors and have they been gaining or losing share and try to understand the technology mod which is and I&#39;m not dismissing it this is it&#39;s a very hard exercise and this is why Buffett for so many years avoided software and technology companies um is because the barriers to entry are low and you just have to understand how the software works and why it can&#39;t be disrupted and that&#39;s a hard hard ask um if you can buy it with enough margin of safety that&#39;s a good thing it looks like this thing is turning so I like your your thought process but you really have to understand it otherwise you just put it in the too hard bin Matt tumau thoughts on Intel&#39;s new CEO the interim it&#39;s just a placeholder uh no thoughts uh we&#39;re not going to know anything for two months so don&#39;t expect miracles unless they panic and appoint the guy who I want from Cadence and they do it quickly um but boards never do that they don&#39;t get paid by the uh the hour miles Frasier really enjoying the podcast wanted to get your thoughts on two stocks JD and Dollar General uh Dollar General we&#39;ve been looking at for a while I think we would probably be more inclined to go with Dollar Tree we&#39;re not doing that because we have enough exposure with a similar low-end consumer cons retailer called Advanced Auto Parts which we like but if we didn&#39;t own Advanced Auto Parts we&#39;d probably take a very serious look at both of Dollar Tree and Dollar General I think they&#39;re going to recover uh and I think it&#39;s going to make time I love the fact that they&#39;re beat down over the Tariff fears because they&#39;re going to be worse than advertised uh better than advertised rather than less less bad uh njd I think that um uh JD JD&#39;s fine but I&#39;d rather play it through Baba because they&#39;ve got the cloud business so um leave it there uh next question comes from thanks miles Alex Ward uh trmd which is a shipper shipping companies are garbage um very cyclical we had a nice move on front line at one point I this is a tough business I mean honestly if you&#39;re gonna go into shipping you&#39;re best to buy the ships when there&#39;s a glut and wait for the cycle to tighten but um that&#39;s not what we do I&#39;ll take a quick look for you but it&#39;s a good way to lose a lot of money is buying shipper equities I remember all the people Lemmings chasing Zim shipping and it was going to go up forever and um it collapsed Fleet of product tankers in the UK see these land Banks and shipping companies these are the things that people confuse as quality value investing versus deep value or special situations and this type of deep value stuff is what gives value investing a bad name because people get bagged in this stuff for 10 years and it never does anything um I generally wouldn&#39;t touch a shipper unless it&#39;s really like a like a 2009 bottom cycle and I&#39;m pretty confident that they&#39;re not going to go bankrupt I understand what you&#39;re seeing here I&#39;m just telling you that there ways to lose a lot of money shippers are are one miners are another this this does look like it&#39;s getting better but to your point you say that Howard marks is currently the main shareholder in selling large chunks of stock which are affecting the share price so he doesn&#39;t need to sell why is he selling what does he know that you don&#39;t know and I don&#39;t I generally don&#39;t want to be on the other side of a trade with Howard marks which is why it interests me that Howard marks is buying the hell out of China ### ASK_ME_ANYTHING_QA why d peer buying the hell out of China so uh higher and better uses I think your thinking framework Alex got you to a good place I just think you&#39;re in the wrong sector to play that game even if the stock price goes up it&#39;s like you&#39;re in a sector where the odds are against you to win from a historical standpoint you get lucky from time to time and make multi-baggers but uh you&#39;ll give it back to the casino because it&#39;s it&#39;s an unsound uh place to allocate Capital Sophie have you looked at wind Resorts new UAE project seems like it would get a boost from the company um when is a China play we&#39;re playing it through Baba I think it&#39;s okay here I don&#39;t think you&#39;re going to get an easy double and we prefer doubles and triples that are pretty easy and pretty predictable with the risk being time and irr that doesn&#39;t really qualify um but it&#39;s a good company ### ASK_ME_ANYTHING_QA Greg says thanks for the analysis on diio I&#39;ve been working on opco what do you think I think it&#39;s a I think it&#39;s a garbage spec play that only has any credibility because Phil Frost has been dumping tons of money in it for years and years and years uh and Phil Frost started tea and he was an investor major investor at the first hedge fund that I worked at and he&#39;s a super smart guy and he&#39;s made a ton of money and this thing he&#39;s been bagged in for literally 16 17 years buying it up at 19 buying it down at a dollar so he obviously thinks it can work he&#39;s one of the smartest Minds in biotech so you have to gamble on if he is he going to be right in the next 18 days or is he going to be right in the next 18 years and I have no Edge on that which is why we own xbi and we&#39;ll take our simple over a few years and uh be Off to the Races but this thing tell me what your Edge is and I&#39;ll tell you whether you should be involved and uh uh for me there I have no Edge on that one Tim Ted do um this is one of the covid Darlings that&#39;s probably starting to show signs of Life everyone&#39;s copying it I don&#39;t really know what the mode is Amazon tried to get into the business everything&#39;s accelerating here ### ASK_ME_ANYTHING_QA um PD I mean this is probably one let&#39;s take a look financials income statement H who put this on quarterly that&#39;s why okay half of my numbers were off because this was switched to quarterly versus annual sorry about that um so revenues are decelerating never good on a Momo stock free cash flow is okay balance sheet 1.2 billion balance sheets okay just don&#39;t understand why they&#39;re losing so much uh what is the charge that let&#39;s see here $2 billion on 300 million of free cash flow with flat sales ### ASK_ME_ANYTHING_QA um look it&#39;s obviously more reasonably priced uh the key is are there any Catalyst for change ### ASK_ME_ANYTHING_QA um let me see what they&#39;re doing with the free cash flow are they buying in shares or are they issuing shares they keep issuing shares or giving shares to themselves I mean the share counts gone from 42 million to 168 million these this management is a bunch of pigs and uh I don&#39;t like that that&#39;s just a warning sign for me they they have no respect for Equity so I&#39;d look at it and just see what is the competition from other players in the market it might be cheap enough but any management that does this to the Share account I have zero respect for so I&#39;m not going to be involved with operators like that ### ASK_ME_ANYTHING_QA Philipe Andrew pinkos agricultural sector yeah I don&#39;t share all my positions so sorry about that ### ASK_ME_ANYTHING_QA Joseph cont top book recommendations to read for Joseph oberti uh tlick over tlick ### ASK_ME_ANYTHING_QA thanks Joseph start with the intelligent investor by Ben Graham read that if the light bulb doesn&#39;t go off go just go to a different career uh and make a lot of money doing something else uh it&#39;s just not for everyone ### ASK_ME_ANYTHING_QA if that does click read security analysis if that clicks start reading the CFA books if that clicks read every Buffet annual letter that you&#39;ve ever that he&#39;s ever published you can find them on Burkshire halfway. comom and then you can find his partnership letter on the internet margin of safety by Seth claran is is a worthwhile read ### ASK_ME_ANYTHING_QA um you can be a stock market genius by Joel green blad is a good read and that should keep you busy for three or four months and after that you can send back another question I&#39;ve read all that stuff what do you recommend next ### ASK_ME_ANYTHING_QA uh okay next is Mark Sher with the breath you expect outside the mag 7 people could play that with an equal weight or better with individual names are you aware of an exotic product that tracks to 493 I&#39;m not interested in exotic products that is a formula for cash incineration it exotic equals cash incinerator and it&#39;s your cash that&#39;s going to be incinerated sooner or later so stick stay away ### ASK_ME_ANYTHING_QA have you looked at Bath and Body Works uh I don&#39;t like this business yes I have we&#39;ve looked at it on the podcast it looks fine I don&#39;t want to be involved ### ASK_ME_ANYTHING_QA bath body works this is bbwi revenues have been dropping cash flow has been dropping pric has been going nowhere there are higher and better uses not not really interested ### ASK_ME_ANYTHING_QA namon want to pick your thoughts on tariffs regarding China Mexico and Canada ### ASK_ME_ANYTHING_QA aate loer we own uh um yeah they were the same fears in 2016 and um Cooper standard had their best year ever in 2017 so I wouldn&#39;t overthink that uh other than that

    "HEADLINES_AND_NEWS": "\n\n### HEADLINES_AND_NEWS\nwelcome to hedge fun tips with Tom Hayes I&#39;m Tom Hayes and this is your 268th videoast podcast for the week ending December 4th 2024\n\ncame to the right conclusion and I guess look at $80 or $90 they would have had to consider it I just don&#39;t think that was on the table and to even have a meeting over 60 you know one of the there are two primary criteria that turnaround Tom has when he&#39;s going into a business number one is if I were to get financed by JP Morgan to buy 100% of the company uh at these prices that are quoted in the public markets and I presented that to the board uh would the board ask security to remove me from the premises because they thought I was absolutely a Looney Tune and I&#39;m looking to buy great businesses at Looney Tune prices which the public markets Mr Market it&#39;s manic depressive if you read Benjamin Graham&#39;s intelligent investor uh serves these up and and if the board would not have me escorted off the premises because my order off was ridiculous I.E the price that it&#39;s quoted in the public markets uh then I&#39;m less interested uh and number two if this position goes to zero will they take me out on the on a stretcher and that has to also be no meaning it&#39;s not sized in a way that it has a terminal effect if there&#39;s something that I don&#39;t know that I don&#39;t know uh and usually the lower expected value return the higher the certainty and the ability to size up so if the expected value on an investment is a double over two to three to four years it&#39;s probably got a high degree of certainty business and it&#39;s uh low risk in terms of balance sheet in terms of cyclicality in terms of uh newness I have data through many many cycles I have confidence in management so I can make it big size with a relatively reasonable expect Ed return 30 plus% irr um uh maybe higher if it happens faster maybe a little lower but over a basket of 10 to 12 uh I can hit my targets um and uh and the ones that have the higher expected returns of 3x 5x 10x because they&#39;re so pounded and I&#39;m looking for some refinance Catalyst or some cyclical adjustment and a highly operating leveraged business uh then I have to size it accordingly you know that&#39;s not going to be a Max siiz position uh if there&#39;s a possibility because if you know if you get taken out on a 15% position it&#39;s you know it&#39;s going to take a a year to make that back from the other eight or 10 positions so you don&#39;t ever want to be in that position uh so that&#39;s got to be sized down but if the expected value is eight or 10x uh even a five to six to 7% position is a material contributor over three or four years so that&#39;s kind of a little bit about how I think about it but it was interesting to see this explanation from Buffett that effectively embodies how I think about it and which I probably learned from him which I learned most of the things I learned from him ### HEADLINES_AND_NEWS stocks tend to do well in the December of an election year this is from Ryan Dietrich over at Carson so 83% positivity rate 1.3% average gains December is historically solid month uh past 20 years up uh you know one in change an election year up even more since 1950 up even more so all these things point to a positive December don&#39;t bet against it average return after the Market&#39;s up 20% year-to date is 2.4% uh junk to treasury bond spreads no concerns of risk uh I would just say that you know you often when when volatility initially comes down this low and people present this as a reason to say watch out we&#39;re at the top you often have multiple bumps along the bottom before you get the next Spike I mean and this is a bad sample it&#39;s only 24 years but like even dot you had this crazy Spike like you had with covid but then you get this one roll over again and that&#39;s kind of halfway through the rally just like we got this one roll over about halfway through the rally and and you keep going you know here it went for four plus years here we about two years into it um same thing with uh 2011 you got this huge Spike during the financial crisis on the vix uh treasury bond spreads no concerns of risk then you get this uh After Shock in 2011 just like you got in 2022 which by the way it&#39;s funny in 2022 I a friend who was saying that&#39;s it look at credit spreads and I said that happens every cycle this is an Aftershock and I remember on the podcast talking about these and he went all to cash and you know he claims that he was buying it anyway it is what it is and um and then it rolled back over and then you still had multiple years and you had one more Spike so I think you probably have another one probably in the midterm election year if I had to guess and that&#39;s when I&#39;d start to get a little bit more cautious and and harvesting a lot of the things that were in all items Consumer Price Index 12- month change so that&#39;s been oh this is interesting so this is from 1914 to 1929 ladies and gentlemen which is the Once in a 100y year event the Spanish Flu 1917 1918 you had this huge spike in inflation two years later it collapsed like we&#39;ve been seeing the last uh 12 months uh Rose a little bit and then just stayed level all the way through 1929 and I think this is kind of the base case it&#39;ll be a little more elevated from here and it&#39;ll probably stay that way uh till the end of the the decade and um and the other interesting thing about these comparisons like the Roaring 20s and I talk a lot about it on the podcast is you had the same type of demographic benefit where you had a large segment of the population at housing formation years in the 20s so some people think it was because the Spanish flu and the aftermarket the roaring 20 some think it was because of the automobile but I think demographics also had a lot to do with it very similar to uh what we&#39;re seeing now and if you look at like 1910 through uh 1930 again like another 18 to 20 year secular bull you had that young population so we were about halfway through I think we&#39;re about you know a little bit more than halfway through here if you consider probably since 2009 so probably at least another 6 seven8 years in this bull run and that&#39;s what it&#39;s going to look like the last 6 seven8 years in terms of inflation a little elevated and that&#39;ll bring down debt to GDP like we saw post World War II December rarely is the worst month of the year uh this is from Seth golden I&#39;ve not seen retail rail traffic data this ridiculous head strong in recession slowdown ever uh so he&#39;s yeah he&#39;s basically talking about what we&#39;ve been talking about for several months which is very hard to have a recession when you have rail traffic that strong corporate insiders are stock sales reach all-time high this is another thing people are pointing to to say the rally is over uh I think the smart way to look at this is that corporate insiders are often very early uh you know if you look here they were three years early selling at this level in 2004 that often happens because they&#39;re stuck in recency bias like they remember three years ago how bad things were this is like their way to get out at you know pre-pandemic levels or whatever it happens to be uh and I think they&#39;re going to be early this time as well not all companies some are going to be right uh maybe Jensen will be right selling a billion dollars a stock on the retail investors but uh the rest of them uh were way too early 2012 2003 uh and it just keeps going 2016 etc etc ### HEADLINES_AND_NEWS JD Power November new vehicle sales expected to Surge to 16.5 million SAR consumer spending to reach highest level ever for November that&#39;s from a few days ago um projected to reach 1.36 million a 6.7% increase from November 2023 on a selling day adjusted basis that&#39;s a forecast from JD Power and the seasonally adjusted annualized rate for total new vehicle sales is expected to be 16.5 million ladies and gentlemen if we get 16.5 for a year I think Cooper standard could earn potentially at 16.5 more than it earned in 2017 on 17.1 meaning greater than seven bucks a share so put whatever multiple you want on it the worst multiple was 10 when they were making money the best multiple was 20 we love it uh and we don&#39;t have anything else to say about it 6,000 is here now what this is from trick 12 months later after major Milestones average up 88.6% I think that makes a lot of sense I think that would be the right number for 2024 for the S&P to be up 8.6 it wouldn&#39;t surprise me if it was up 12.6 wouldn&#39;t surprise me if it was up 7.6 it would surprise me if it was up 19.6 I&#39;ll leave it at that monthly return stats for the S&P 500 and by the way that&#39;s the that is the type of environment where we mint money uh monthly return stats for S&P 500s 1964 to 2023 December had the highest positivity ratio behind uh April average return 1.3% which is the third highest after November and April real consumer spending Trends Services going up non- durable goods durable goods durable goods that&#39;s cars Etc Canada&#39;s exports the US Energy is a huge export to the US uh China manufacturing going up no one&#39;s talking about it that&#39;s fine they will after they after the fact these are good numbers ladies and gentlemen economic China mrb economic activity indicator off the charts uh composite PMI inflecting upward no one&#39;s talking about it India&#39;s economy slows sharply adding pressure on Central Bank to cut rates people couldn&#39;t get enough India at the exact wrong time couldn&#39;t sell China exact wrong time we&#39;re going to see an inflection in both India down China up S&P equal weighted 12mon forward PE again right at the average Point here at 18 times relative to the S&P at 22 times um S&P to TLT ratio stocks to bonds at a range Peak more than 2.7 standard deviations above the mean bonds up big surprise for 2025 bonds up yields down market cap weighted underperform Tech weighted underperform broadening Market other sectors earnings growth accelerating outperform next year small cap same thing uh sells side Equity sentiment again elevated not extreme great financial crisis pushed stock allocations below the traditional 60 to 65% ban so for everyone talking about households rushing into stocks they&#39;re still not nearing anywhere near um certainly not the tech highs and certainly not the pre-financial crisis highs we&#39;re still stock at 57% and the mean is probably around 59 to 60% and Peaks were 71% so putting it in perspective bull bear indicator at 4.7 again doesn&#39;t really point to uh acute top Bank of America projects near 100 basis points of policy easing in 2025 I will take the under on that I I well let me see all right confidence surges among small business owners so I don&#39;t have to go after that let let&#39;s see what the coin flip odds are after Powell spoke today for December uh very interesting the odds shot up today for 78% chance of a cut in December if he does that I think he can be done for a while I think that would be the right move I think that he could potentially do nothing until at least March and then maybe from there two more cuts and done if that take it down to four maybe Max 375 uh and that&#39;s all he&#39;s going to need biggest underperformance of Europe versus the us since 1976 what happened next biggest outperformance of Europe versus the US this is no different than um Emerging Markets the same thing you are going to see this inflect and what&#39;s going to be the catalyst is the same thing you saw in the 70s and the same thing you saw in the periods where it outperformed is that the terminal rate is much higher than the previous cycle and with a terminal rate at 375 or four uh value and xus outperform and we&#39;re going to see the same thing this if you don&#39;t take this bet US Stocks very exceptional relative to European equities uh some probably four standard deviations above the mean uh then you just you know God bless you I mean uh but I don&#39;t know how to put this I mean it&#39;s not saying bet 100% on this but if you see an extreme like this and you don&#39;t take five or 10 or 15% of your portfolio and expose yourself somehow to the reversion of the mean instead you chase four standard deviations up uh number one you&#39;re begging for a reaming and number two uh you&#39;re missing a generational opportunity to make obscene amounts of money in a short period of time and look you can be wrong if you&#39;re on margin is where you&#39;ll get hurt if you&#39;re not on margin and it takes three years longer than you expect to make 10x on that 10% of your portfolio or 15% of your portfolio uh it doesn&#39;t matter the irr is so insane relative to everything else you have to take that bet and if you&#39;re wrong probably all that happens is that was dead money in your portfolio you didn&#39;t lose because you&#39;re buying at such a discount to intrinsic value uh you just didn&#39;t win so you&#39;d have a one or 200 basis points drag on your over overall portfolio but you might have a 150% accretion from that 10% if you did take the bet so those asymmetric bets and I learned that from my years at Cornwall Capital if you watch the movie The Big Short they were masters of asymmetric bets and I learned a lot from listening to them and that&#39;s by the way how I got my foot in the door I gave them a short soybeans trade they made 5x in 90 days uh 25 million bucks on a $5 million investment on puts in summer of 2012 uh and um and that&#39;s that so so this is one of those examples of asymmetry yes I know growth is going to be slower yes I know all that but the difference is lagard will probably go down to 1% terminal rate we&#39;re going down to 4% terminal rate and she&#39;ll Juice It Up so I&#39;m not saying bet on Europe I&#39;m saying bet on Emerging Markets but you can find some opportunities there and we we&#39;re making an implicit European bet with gxo for sure India stock funds see largest four-week outflow since June 2022 couldn&#39;t get enough here now it&#39;s rolling over they&#39;re all getting out and that&#39;s going to persist for many years in our vle China discount or India premium India premium in my view forward PE in China 9.8 times forward PE in India 22.58% perform but if you go back a little further China has had periods of outperformance and this is going to revert back and if you don&#39;t understand reversion to the mean 100% wrong business for you in my view um I look I&#39;ve been in this business long enough to watch the Momo guys come in get decapitated uh some rise rise from the dead uh and get another shot like Kathy Woods got smoked uh in the um Tech W in 2000 she came back built a monster business got smoked again but she&#39;s a Survivor and by the way I think she&#39;s gonna have an enormous run the next three to five years so kudos to her uh in some sense and um but very few of the Momo Chasers uh uh get get to chapter two they they chase up they get smoked out and they find another career um whereas the value the biggest risk of the value guys over time the ones that are good uh is that they go through periods of year or two of underperformance relative to the index and then the third year they make it all back in spades because they have a triple digit year and everyone&#39;s like oh my God the irr is 35% a year that&#39;s so amazing blah blah blah but it&#39;s it&#39;s not they&#39;re betting on sure things they&#39;re just playing the time Arbitrage game and the ones who are really good at it don&#39;t use uh meaningful leverage and over time they win and um that&#39;s probably my best advice to all the young people that are listening uh don&#39;t get lured into the shiny object game because it will lead to a short career um or if you do get caught up and make obscene amounts of money in a short period of time take your Chips off the table after your two free drinks and and leave the casino ### HEADLINES_AND_NEWS Bank of America forecasting 124 rate cuts by central banks in 2025 okay so if you&#39;re going to get 124 cuts xus and three Cuts us where do you want to place your bets ladies and gentlemen where the 121 cuts are happening or where the three cuts are happening so again this is um stuff to pay attention to and in those periods where you had these massive Cuts you saw the benefits of xus Emerging Markets during those years you can go back and trace it um okay again from dri S&P returns Final six months went up 10 okay we covered that December gains after 20% plus um have averaged you know you had 4.4 2.9 2.4 1.8 5.1 so what they&#39;re saying\n\n### HEADLINES_AND_NEWS\nBank of America

we&#39;ve been talking about this theme you look at the uh different Regional manufacturing results we are coming out of the manufacturing recession and that&#39;s going to fuel the next phase of the bull market which has been in a depression manufacturing ISM Manufacturing turning up new orders turning up private construction turning up uh this is interesting ISM Manufacturing PMI has lagged cyclicals uh over defense and that&#39;s going to play Massive catchup on the uh pmis Japan corporate profits rolling over to negative again people couldn&#39;t get enough China and um excuse me people couldn&#39;t get enough India and Japan at the exact wrong time and sure enough rolling over Russell 2000 this actually broke out small caps broke out just beginning uh Global manufacturing PMI turning up from negative so that that points to X us uh biggest exporters interestingly enough uh China exports 3.4 trillion a year we only export two trillion a year Japan shockingly is only 700 billion and India is only 400 billion so uh South Korea is a big exporter that&#39;s why we watch them a lot um and so on it&#39;s good to see that in color uh S&P index around election day you get this pop up then December early pullback whether we&#39;ve seen that already I don&#39;t know and then push up and then grind sideways so we&#39;ll see uh federal government spending you can see by category Social Security being the highest health care net interest this they&#39;re going to bring rates down Medicare National Defense income security veterans benefits so we&#39;ll see what VC and uh Elon can do over last four decades November through January has been the strongest period for the Russell 2000 I think that continues December&#39;s been the best month for small relative to large caps I think we&#39;re going to see a follow through on that despite today was led by Tech because CRM said the word Ai and their results and everyone got excited um and OCTA S&P 500 monthly seasonality for all years so here&#39;s a color visual of what we talked about earlier December July April and January are all good months so you know I wouldn&#39;t get too an to sell until mid until the inauguration January 20th is generally where I&#39;d be looking second third fourth week uh for things that are super fully valued for things that are not valued forget this timing nonsense and seasonality nonsense you sell it when it&#39;s when it&#39;s met your targets which you should have discerned before you even got into the position every single position we know where we&#39;re getting out before we get in the only thing that changes that calculus is if the facts change and the fundamentals get better or worse than we anticipated where they&#39;d be three years out uh but we&#39;ve modeled it and we know where where we&#39;re going um and when we want to get there so uh manufacturing PMI oh this is interesting price indicator suggests deflationary pressures eased in November this is China went from negative to positive that&#39;s a big deal same thing with manufacturing PA PMI from contraction to expansion so all the things in the stimulus that people are impatient about are coming through would we like direct consumer stimulus yes they&#39;re going to have another big meeting expectations are so low because every big meeting they the bed maybe this time it&#39;ll be different because no one expects anything here&#39;s Jeffrey H who I was talking about the stock Traders Almanac you should buy one by the way if you don&#39;t have one teach you a lot about seasonality and historical data I think it&#39;s good to have um choppy first half of December before a yearend rally so basically you rise up a little bit on average um through the 10th then weak into the 13th 14th 15th and then the yearend rally called the Santa Claus rally last five seven days of the year job openings rise and more workers quit in sign of improving US Labor Market um so that&#39;s good that was a little bit worrisome and there was another fed speaker out earlier in the week who said the word skip which was a little concerning to me but it seems like Powell put the market at ease today with what he said and now we&#39;ve got the odds but that&#39;s kind of meaningless until we get the jobs number um the initial numbers pointed to a number that&#39;s going to be supportive of doing a cut in De December and I think that would just be really set the stage and after that if you&#39;re asking for a lot more Cuts after that you&#39;re kind of being greedy I think if they frontload them the way they&#39;ve been doing you know one is plenty wait three months see how the data comes in one or two next year and let the let the machine run Wards Automotive US Auto Sales SAR this is at 16.5 what&#39;s really interesting if you if you look at it from like a chared standpoint you can see here in 2017 and 18 it got 18 got up over 18 million according to this data um well that okay that was a monthly but the annual came out at 17.1 Blended because you see they had some months at 16 then shot over 18 so 171 when they earned $719 a share so we just got a

really good news ladies and gentlemen so I&#39;m excited\n### HEADLINES_AND_NEWS\ngxo Logistics this was a note out from steel thanks to my friends over there I know we&#39;ve got a lot of listeners um so gxo backs away from buyout talks and announces plan CEO retirement next year I thought last week&#39;s was going to be short it was like two hours by the way last week&#39;s was one of the better ones of the year uh this week&#39;s we&#39;ve got so much stuff to cover I I thought it was going to be a half hour call again um retirement next year fundamental thesis unchanged and what they do they talk about multiple on you know 950 of adjusted eida for 2025 uh multiple 11 to 12 times which yields North to 7 $70 a share so they&#39;ve got a 12mon price Target of $74 which is 21 times their 2025 EPS estimate at 345 no change there I think that&#39;s going to surprise to the upside and again I think it&#39;s a $100 stock over the next few years um us light vehicle sales to prize on the high side again in November if you remember September was weak October was great November&#39;s great make car sales great again over the LA over half of borrowing by smaller nonpublic businesses is linked to short-term rates so that&#39;s good for refinancing uh we get another cut I think if you see Cooper standard is going to cash pay their debt this quarter and if they can be cash flow positive in this quarter and you get another cut into year end I think they could Finance the whole slug of debt in the first quarter of next year at advantageous rates and then maybe do it again A year later and uh and then just roll it out to 2030 which we don&#39;t need we need three to four years for this thing to hit if that I mean at the rate things are going we&#39;re going to hit 17 SAR a lot quicker than anticipated and $7 of earnings maybe faster than anticipated and uh you know we understand what kind of businesses is although with the technology ad I think they&#39;re going to smooth out some of the cyclicality but um um anyway very exciting on that one city economic surprising by the way interesting thing about Advanced Auto Parts I hadn&#39;t planned to talk about it they got a debt downgrade duh uh this week it sold off and now it&#39;s back up 10% from where it sold off to which is pretty exciting to see so it was a final sell uh people selling in the hole and uh all the all the weak money&#39;s out now and uh Shane Shane o Kelly can can go execute on the dense plan in the number one and two month markets which we talked about two weeks ago super excited about that one city economic surprise index rolling over a little bit in the Euro Zone a little bit weaker so we keep an eye on that Peak growth priced for the Magnificent 7 last time they were that high was the end of 2021 uh you had a big correction in 2022 in Tech so I think that&#39;s the I think that&#39;s the area to keep your eye on in 2025 if you&#39;re going to have any pain maybe it&#39;ll be in some of those selected names us which will keep the indices subdued and opportunity under the surface again 3.3 standard deviations This Is Us boom versus global bust go ahead and bet against that but if you don&#39;t take advantage of asymmetric opportunities with some portion of your portfolio you&#39;re never going to get seriously rich I mean the these are what wet dreams in the financial markets are made out of is taking asymmetric Bets with a limited side that has maximum upside Limited downside uh and if you do it with low leverage you can wait until it\n\n###

it here uh okay their credit got upgraded but the real reason they were up I think their traffic was up\n\n### FEATURED_COMPANY_DEEP_DIVES\nIntel Intel has more than 65% of the market for traditional PCS and 85% of the server Market Market according to Edward Jones look they&#39;ve screwed up a lot that&#39;s why the Stock&#39;s trading at $20 um I&#39;m I&#39;m not a big fan of the firing of Ginger but I&#39;m also not against it and the reason I&#39;m not against it well here&#39;s the thing he did do the five no he&#39;s going to complete the five nodes in four years he&#39;s doing exactly what he said he was going to do it wasn&#39;t fast enough for the board [Music] um but there are some serious names in contention and one of the names in contention is a guy named lip buan and lip ban got into a company called Cadence Design cdns in January of 2009 and the stock was down 90% % it dropped from $24 to $242 uh from 2008 to 2009 when he got involved the stock then subsequently and he&#39;s still executive chairman by the way has gone from $242 to $328 under his tenure and I will say oh well he just got in at the bot bottom of the cycle he got lucky that&#39;s not the case because the the business had grinded sideways for the previous 15 years and did nothing so it was this guy getting involved that turned it from a sleepy dead company to a money-making machine from 2009 to 2024 uh with uh basically a 60 no 150 bagger it&#39;s not quite 150 bagger it&#39;s like 125 bagger not saying he&#39;s going to do that for Intel I&#39;m not saying he&#39;s going to be the pick but uh if we could bring in someone that would get the street excited I think when the 18a is done next year and they figure out what they want to be when they grow up with a new CEO uh look I know for certain that the business is worth $45 to $50 on the Legacy business and we&#39;ve said that since day one and we got involved we got a run up to $48 we we made a quick double we got out it came back to $29 we started to reinitiate oh and we got lucky lucky uh we had a chance to buy a ton in the High Teens uh and bring our bases back down for the second run at it and it&#39;ll run back up to 45 at some point and then we&#39;re going to decide is it all that it is just a just another double and we&#39;re out uh or has something changed and they can they become a real player with the big boys and girls and uh take advantage of some of these major trends that are happening over the next five years I think it&#39;s going to be the ladder and I think at 45 we&#39;re going to be hodlers to a lot higher 80 90 100 but but now you&#39;ve got an issue in the short term which is a problem which is now they have to go through a pretend search even if they know who they&#39;re going to do they got to drag it out for couple weeks not a couple weeks a couple of months of indecision about who&#39;s going to be the CEO what&#39;s going to be the next plan so it&#39;s be dead money for a couple of months that&#39;s the downside of Ginger being out the upside is if they liquidate it tomorrow we get all of our money back and probably a couple more bucks um and then the intrinsic value is a double on the Legacy business and um and maybe a five plus bagger if they actually get their head on straight get the right person doing it and the joke is going to be that probably everything gelsinger laid out comes to pass and someone else gets the credit and um and that&#39;ll be fine too so uh so that&#39;s that&#39;s the story on Intel China&#39;s leaders plan to discuss GDP Target and stimulus next week that is on Wednesday closed door Central economic work conference economic targets and stimulus plans for 2025 so you can see they&#39;re doing the same exact Playbook that they did in 2016 after the inauguration they weaken the Yuan and they say okay put on another 10% tariffs we&#39;ll just lower the value of our currency by another 10% and have no net effect on our economy uh and then after he gets inaugurated then you know the the game gets back on Trump looks good has noet effect on China because they&#39;ve lowered their currency against it and then the tariffs wind up being less the Yuan appreciates the dollar weekends and We&#39;re Off to the Races with emerging markets in China same story different year Alibaba Cloud aims high in Southeast Asia in 2025 with new AI Partners they&#39;re dominating Indonesia Thailand other markets CEOs are getting tossed out at a record Pace that is the opportunity for us we love it in Intel we love it in Advanced Auto Parts we love it in PayPal by the way which no one&#39;s talking about we love it in Boeing we love it in um I mean it&#39;s it&#39;s almost turnaround Tom&#39;s Playbook I mean every company I get involved in is the new CEO we love it in uh Este louder we&#39;re getting a new CEO um what else what are we missing here gener did it with the same CEO Cooper sard&#39;s going to do it with the same CEO uh um gxo is going to get a new CEO that that&#39;s that&#39;s good um and what else anyway so that&#39;s a good thing that&#39;s a catalyst for change especially when they get the right guys in there like Alex Chris like Shane o Kelly like so many others that we&#39;ve talked about uh Intel considers Outsiders for CEO including Marvel&#39;s head Marvel said no but lip Buu ton for my money that would be the miracle Choice uh makes two to much sense they won&#39;t do it but look when you have 65 and 85% of certain markets look they&#39;ve worked overtime to try to screw it up but it&#39;s very hard to destroy that and um if they can get someone with a pulse and a heartbeat in uh and catch a catch the next Cy upgrade cycle it&#39;s going to make a lot of money even if they&#39;ve got you know basically a weekend up Joe Biden could run the company and it would it would recover back to 45 I don&#39;t know if it would recover back I don&#39;t know if it would go to 80 or 90 on the new plan but he could run it uh and it would definitely rebound back to 4045 so that that tells you everything you need to know gxo spurns acquisition offers as CEO Wilson steps down\n\n### TECHNICAL_CHARTS\nhere&#39;s the chart several months ago we discussed a new position in albam Maro basis 9322 it&#39;s not a large uh position yet because of the time of initiation there was limited excess uninvested Capital to put to work as new capital came in price ran away from us we don&#39;t buy up we do think we will get additional opportunities to size up this position as more data comes in maybe today we didn&#39;t add yet today but we I&#39;d like to see it back in the 90s before I started to look to size up um but if not we&#39;re okay with what we have Alam Maro is in keeping with our theme to find more materials exposure in 2025 as the sector has been decimated and earnings growth is expected to recover handsomely estimates are for 18.9% earnings growth uh up from 18.7 just a few months ago for 2025 Alba Mar&#39;s primary business is lithium production we can see below the Stock&#39;s most recent Spike and collapse in price from 21 to 24 correlates with the spike and drop of the price of lipian carbonate so car lithium carbonate ripped higher collapsed albam Maro stock price ripped higher collapsed I I generally avoid commodity stocks for this very reason basically because you got to get two things right you got to get the commodity right and you got to get the company operations right um that&#39;s with the exception of oil and natural gas stocks when I can buy the commodity cheaper on the New York Stock Exchange than in the fields I learned that tactic from Reading uh John Paul Getty&#39;s legendary book how to be rich highly recommend for everyone however when you look at Alba maro&#39;s long-term price chart the correlation unravels Alba Marl has historically has a moat around its business which when executing at proper levels can mint money irrespective of the price of the underlying commodity so if you look in the short term you see yeah this huge blip that huge blip actually this one was the 2016 to 18 blip uh and this one was the 2020 to 24 blip um but if you go back further then you had like 10 years and you still had a business That Grew From $5 a share to $65 a share with effectively flat lithium carbonate prices China&#39;s appetite for EVS shows no sign of abating even if in North America sales have softened of late if these estimates prove to be 25% true albamar will not not be able to handle all the demand required in coming years reminds me of Boeing Boeing Boeing&#39;s got 10 years of backlog that&#39;s what&#39;s albam Maro is going to be uh based on current trends Bloomberg NF forecast that by 2027 annual Global sales of Passenger EVS will top 30 million rising to 73 million by 20 40 penetration rates will hit 33% in 2027 73% in 2040 I think that&#39;s optimistic between 2024 to 2027 kager is expected to be around 21% a sharp drop from the 20 to 2023 surge EV stock will grow from 41 million at the end of 2023 to 132 Million by 2027 from their lips to God uh Cooper standard has I believe 20 more per Parts capacity on EV than they do on IES so they make 20% more per car but if you look at this when you look at the American part of this uh you can see why we have such a jaded view like we you can&#39;t even see us on this map rest of the world like you can&#39;t even see where America fits in on this growth all the growth is in China and China&#39;s been pushing the EV so if the government&#39;s pushing it just like they&#39;ll push it to over capacity but again where the Arms Dealer so just like we love selling the sealers and the fluid transfer systems and the fuel delivery of Cooper standard to the oems who are going to race to the bottom overproduce and cut margins like it&#39;s going out of style um same thing with the lithium producer albam Maro let them oversupply flood the market with EVS we benefit from all the lithium required to go in and we&#39;re buying it like Buffett said oh in this one four available at a very attractive price that is the key that most people forget um so you can see again it&#39;s it&#39;s all about China EV demand that&#39;s going to that&#39;s going to benefit lithium that&#39;s going to benefit albam Maro and uh uh as the West Begins to acknowledge the recovery in China as it continues to proliferate and sentiment changes everything with any tie into China is going to go through the roof whether that&#39;s Starbucks whether that&#39;s Estee louder whether that&#39;s her whether that&#39;s Nike whether that&#39;s Lulu whether that&#39;s Alibaba whether that&#39;s albam Maro SE louder uh they&#39;re going to go so fast and it&#39;s going to it&#39;s not going to let anyone in so whether that&#39;s the wec meeting and they say we&#39;re going to do 5% GDP and we&#39;re going to do the stimulus to actually get it done uh or it&#39;s the next meeting or who knows uh or it&#39;s just the inflection into January 1 like it was after Trump got elected last time uh it&#39;s really immaterial the key is it&#39;s imminent and what you see here in the long-term Alber uh albam Maro data 2024 was an aberration due to short-term Global lithium overc capacity which is what happens in commodity cyclical businesses but if you look back sales are sales per share are still much higher than 2021 uh approaching 2022 levels next year we&#39;ll be back to 22 levels 2023 was an aberration and you came off the boil so if you draw out the long-term average trend line uh it&#39;s it&#39;s doing fine okay and certainly they got cut off at the kneecaps but the price reflects that so you know you have a stock that dropped from $327 to $71 okay and with huge leverage around the prices of lithium which are at or near historic lows in the short term and the Chinese government is not going to let up on EVS because that puts a lot of people to work that&#39;s their initiative and they&#39;re going to push it uh till the cows come home which is going to help the Chinese economy Chinese manufacturing and it&#39;s going to help albam Maro so um you could see here in the value line estimates they&#39;re expecting a recovery and then a reexpansion out to 2027 2029 but historically you look at this business and the return on Capital has been solid High single digits low double digits for a decade plus return on Equity uh even higher uh net profit solid operating margins in the in the low to mid 20s [Music] um they pay out a little dividend while you wait earnings per share have been growing they peaked in 2022 they&#39;ll recover back uh cash flow per share is hanging in there we&#39;ll be cash flow positive again next year so all the things are in the perfect situation for a turnaround Tom special\n\n### MISCELLANEOUS\nsame CEO Cooper sard&#39;s going to do it with the same CEO uh um gxo is going to get a new CEO that that&#39;s that&#39;s good um and what else anyway so that&#39;s a good thing that&#39;s a catalyst for change especially when they get the right guys in there like Alex Chris like Shane o Kelly like so many others that we&#39;ve talked about uh Intel considers Outsiders for CEO including Marvel&#39;s head Marvel said no but lip Buu ton for my money that would be the miracle Choice uh makes

definitely rebound back to 4045 so that that tells you everything you need to know gxo spurns acquisition offers as CEO Wilson steps down uh we covered that are we up to oh wow we&#39;re up to the article of the week all right covered that covered that\n\n### FEATURED_COMPANY_DEEP_DIVES\nreally like the business so while you're probably right um I didn't want to be involved because there was still solvency risk medical Property Trust mpw I mean I don't I don't know where the turnaround comes from the the the free cash flow deterioration shows no end in sight revenues are having I mean this looks like a cigar butt maybe you'll get one last puff out of it for a trade but unless you can get confidence in the turnaround like what has happened to this business um I think you're playing with fire let's take a closer look here so I got 275 million of cash and $9.2 billion of debt I mean yes that debt is secured by assets how much assets we have here 10 billion so you basically got in theory yeah I I don't like this I think I think you got I'd have to spend a lot of time on it but I think you got close to enough solvency risk and if it's close to enough and it's a lower quality business I don't want to play there even if if the trade could be a double or triple if they pull it off um I think you're playing with fire here I would avoid even though the trade will probably work in the short term in the long term it's not a good business \n### HEADLINES_AND_NEWS\nall right so a guy I'm not going to say his name sent me like basically a statement uh um Intel CEO resigns no kidding expected to stay at least until 18a was out the door next year maybe he knows something we don't he didn't resign he got his ass kicked out the door because the board became impatient because they all want to keep their $300,000 a year jobs for showing up for four meetings that's number one um gouty GPU ships currently disappointing winter takes all business blah blah blah it's not a winner takes all business in the short term it always is until they get um competition it's the same with the gp1s it'll be the same with these chips uh so that's a false premise uh in any reasonable

right\n\nBenjamin Graham individuals who cannot Master their emotions are ill suited to profit from the investment process look at Market fluctuations as your friend rather than your enemy profit from Folly rather than participated that&#39;s from Warren Buffett we&#39;re going to talk about some of that Folly today Peter Lynch everyone has the brain power to make money in stocks not everyone has the stomach if you are susceptible to selling everything in a panic you ought to avoid stocks and mutual funds all together\n### QUOTES_OF_THE_WEEK\nlook at fluctuations as your friend rather than your enemy for instance today gxo Logistics uh that thing had traded up you know we were talking about it in the low 50s and high 40s on this uh podcast for a while and then it just shot up to the low 60s on rumors that the company was going to get bought out at whatever 25% premium and everyone was so excited I said that&#39;s the worst thing that could ever happen to us as investors I didn&#39;t get into this to make 10 or 20 or $30 which would be you know $30 if they got it they probably would have taken it at 80 uh which would have been a 60% gain which would have meant we had to pay pay ordinary income taxes on a gain much lower than our expected value of the business over the next 3 years and uh and I voic my concern uh to the company I said look if you&#39;re not getting 80 this is a dumb deal and I&#39;m really surprised that it would even be considered\n### FEATURED_COMPANY_DEEP_DIVES\nand we own a position in qxo and we own a position uh in gxo uh a big position which got a lot bigger this morning so um I&#39;m pretty excited about that I usually don&#39;t buy on the first day down I&#39;ll probably be be able to top up a little more than next few days but um I&#39;m super excited that they didn&#39;t sell it and I&#39;m more excited that I was able to get more people more positioning uh where available uh across the accounts today and take advantage of that opportunity and that&#39;s what we talk about looking at the market fluctuations as your friend rather than your enemy more people probably sold it uh because all the people were in for hot money to make five bucks on a deal and they got smoked which I&#39;m super happy about uh we don&#39;t need those own type of owners in the business and mastering the emotions who would buy a stock that gets pounded in a day other than turnaround Tom uh and in some accounts we were actually able to some we we were able to pick up some shares in the uh below 51 today uh in which case in some accounts we brought down the basis which was pretty excited and uh and some below 52 some below 51 uh but look anything below 100 I think in this stock over the next three years is going to be a bargain so excited about that um here are some of the indicators so yeah we&#39;re stretched but you know you look at the extremes we&#39;re not really at the extremes before a crash we are at levels of enthusiasm you see during bull markets and honestly we haven&#39;t had a protracted one for some time\n### MACRO_DATA_SLIDES\nlook at materials in healthc care which we&#39;re going to talk a little bit about today number one biotech we&#39;ve owned we talked about we love that that&#39;s going to be huge in 2025 uh and uh healthc care uh materials albam Marl we&#39;re going to talk about today that was down today it&#39;s funny in my article I wrote you know it wasn&#39;t as big of a position as we would like because when we were putting it on several months ago and we talked about on the podcast uh one there was a limit where we had capacity we were pretty fully invested\n### TECHNICAL_CHARTS\nArc we talked about a few weeks ago we said watch out she&#39;s going to be like a phoenix From the Ashes was weak after the election in 2016 took off 2017 and she starting to take off Baba what did it do after Trump got elected in 16 kept selling down which is what it&#39;s been doing before the inauguration on January 1 as soon as the calendar year turned and the tax loss selling was done went straight up and never looked back from $84 to $187 in 11 months uh I think we could see a similar repeat of that and I think that&#39;s going to be one of the most shocking trades for 2025 the other shocking trade is that bonds are going to get bid let&#39;s we&#39;ll show you some of these other things momentum stocks did did well uh um small caps we covered China stock same thing as Baba traded all the way down after Trump got elected right before he got inaugurated straight up and never looked back double in uh 11 months and that&#39;s an index by the way equal weighted did fine uh semiconductors did fine uh S&P 500 just ground higher so I mean you look at this situation strong after the election with Trump then a little grind iness in December and January and February and then it just kept pushing higher we&#39;ll see we&#39;ll see on that on the indices uh solar again you know sold off after Trump got elected after the inauguration again choppy for a few months and then started to take back off I think solar is going to do a lot better under Trump than it did under Biden which is counterintuitive uh biotech same story a little weakness after the election a lot of strength uh after the inauguration\n### MISCELLANEOUS\nmaterials same thing we want more materials exposure we&#39;ll talk about Alam Maro on that today and uh hopefully we get another few bad days on Alam Maro so we can make it a real position but um uh Today Was a Good Start uh XLE same thing people think it&#39;ll be strong probably won&#39;t be as strong as people think certainly in that first year financials they&#39;ve moved up a lot I think they&#39;re going to be more sideways than up in the short term and probably second half when that IPO machine uh cranks will be better\n\niness in December and January and February and then it just kept pushing higher we&#39;ll see we&#39;ll see on that on the indices uh solar again you know sold off after Trump got elected after the inauguration again choppy for a few months and then started to take back off I think solar is going to do a lot better under Trump than it did under Biden which is counterintuitive uh biotech same story a little weakness after the election a lot of strength uh after the inauguration um servicers uh were weak everyone thinks they&#39;re going to be strong on Trump I&#39;m still going to hold my comso resources I mean unless the thing went to like 40 and two minutes I I I&#39;m going to hold that one for the long term materials same thing we want more materials exposure we&#39;ll talk about Alam Maro on that today and uh hopefully we get another few bad days on Alam Maro so we can make it a real position but um uh Today Was a Good Start uh XLE same thing people think it&#39;ll be strong probably won&#39;t be as strong as people think certainly in that first year financials they&#39;ve moved up a lot I think they&#39;re going to be more sideways than up in the short term and probably second half when that IPO machine uh cranks will be better ### MISCELLANEOUS\nindustrial same story Tech little bumpy then ground higher they&#39;ll be fine uh Staples we&#39;re going to find some opportunities probably in the next few weeks to get some Staples exposure utility same story down after Trump was elected why because bonds spiked and then um same thing with Healthcare I think healthcare is going to be the opportunity of a lifetime got smoked after he got elected ripped higher after the inauguration consumer discretionary uh exploration production spiked after elected collapsed after inaugurated uh retail same story spiked after elected collapse after inaugurated it it it&#39;s not necessarily going to repeat but it is going to rhyme but the most important one which I don&#39;t know why was not in there is  TLT okay so sold off big which means yields went up after Trump was elected we had the same thing now and then slightly before the inauguration and then a little choppiness after but the whole following year bonds got bid yields compressed I think that&#39;s going to be the biggest surprise the other thing that&#39;s going to be a big surprise the two biggest surprises are yields down and US dollar down look what happened after Trump got elected in 2016 rallied like crazy into January 1 and then collapsed his whole first year of the presidency expect that and what does that do it sends China Emerging Markets through the roof Emerging Markets as the dollar spiked after the election Emerging Markets fell peaked at on Jan one and rolled over Emerging Markets Off to the Races um so that&#39;s that all right let&#39;s go through our data materials again is this oh okay this was a quote from one of Warren Buffett&#39;s letters that I was reading through and I thought it was appropriate to talk about today he said we select our marketable Equity Securities in much the same way we would evaluate a business for acquisition in its entirety we want the business to be number one one that we can understand number two with favorable long-term prospects and number three uh operated by honest and competent people and\n\nfour available at a very attractive price and most people continue to forget number four price is what you pay value is what you get you know you can get distracted ra raed by seeing the shiny objects and all the yahoos chasing the winners and they look great in the short term and then when they get smoked and the company the Momo company hits a misses a quarter and the stock&#39;s down 40% in a matter of days uh you just don&#39;t hear from them for three months they disappear some never come back most never come back some come back and they act like it never happened and eventually people forget but um that&#39;s not what we do so uh um you know to my friend&#39;s point it&#39;s basically like Buffett&#39;s talking about here what would we be willing to pay for the entire business and feel like we got a deal uh we ordinarily make no attempt to buy equities for anticipated favorable stock price behavior in the short term in fact if their business&#39;s experience if their business experience continues to satisfy us we welcome lower market prices of stocks we own as an opportunity to acquire even more of a good thing at a better price and that&#39;s what we do every single week and you know for those companies that take off faster than we want we&#39;re often disappointed that we didn&#39;t get an opportunity to size into it uh because it ran away from us than enthusiastic that it got to our intrinsic value faster than than we wanted it to uh what Buffett&#39;s saying here is  our experience has been that prata portions of truly outstanding businesses sometimes sell in the Securities Market markets at very large discounts from the prices they would command in negotiated transactions involving the entire companies consequently Bargains and business ownership which simply are not available directly through corporate acquisition can be obtained indirectly through stock ownership when prices are appropriate we are willing to take very large positions in selected companies not with any intention of taking control and not foreseeing sellout or merger but with the expectation that excellent business results by corporations will translate over the long term into correspondingly excellent market value and dividend results for our owners minority as well as majority today&#39;s a perfect example with gxo Logistics and even albam Maro and even Intel by the way although you can argue Intel is not a great business I beg to differ and we&#39;ll explain a little bit reasons why uh today but um uh gxo you had all these people bidding it up at you know from 48 to 63 thinking they were going to deal get a deal at 65 or 70 and I was surprised that that management even entertained a deal because they have such a unique position in that market and such an oligopolistic uh situation with DHL basically duopolistic in a fragmented business they can roll up tons of more businesses uh and just control the thing and um uh so anyway I&#39;m glad they\n\n### MISCELLANEOUS\nexperience has been that prata portions of truly outstanding businesses sometimes

traffic did they do it here uh okay their credit got upgraded but the real reason they were up I think their traffic was up\n\n### FEATURED_COMPANY_DEEP_DIVES\nIntel Intel has more than 65% of the market for traditional PCS and 85% of the server Market Market according to Edward Jones look they&#39;ve screwed up a lot that&#39;s why the Stock&#39;s trading at $20 um I&#39;m I&#39;m not a big fan of the firing of Ginger but I&#39;m also not against it and the reason I&#39;m not against it well here&#39;s the thing he did do the five no he&#39;s going to complete the five nodes in four years he&#39;s doing exactly what he said he was going to do it wasn&#39;t fast enough for the board [Music] um but there are some serious names in contention and one of the names in contention is a guy named lip buan and lip ban got into a company called Cadence Design cdns in January of 2009 and the stock was down 90% % it dropped from $24 to $242 uh from 2008 to 2009 when he got involved the stock then subsequently and he&#39;s still executive chairman by the way has gone from $242 to $328 under his tenure and I will say oh well he just got in at the bot bottom of the cycle he got lucky that&#39;s not the case because the the business had grinded sideways for the previous 15 years and did nothing so it was this guy getting involved that turned it from a sleepy dead company to a money-making machine from 2009 to 2024 uh with uh basically a 60 no 150 bagger it&#39;s not quite 150 bagger it&#39;s like 125 bagger not saying he&#39;s going to do that for Intel I&#39;m not saying he&#39;s going to be the pick but uh if we could bring in someone that would get the street excited I think when the 18a is done next year and they figure out what they want to be when they grow up with a new CEO uh look I know for certain that the business is worth $45 to $50 on the Legacy business and we&#39;ve said that since day one and we got involved we got a run up to $48 we we made a quick double we got out it came back to $29 we started to reinitiate oh and we got lucky lucky uh we had a chance to buy a ton in the High Teens uh and bring our bases back down for the second run at it and it&#39;ll run back up to 45 at some point and then we&#39;re going to decide is it all that it is just a just another double and we&#39;re out uh or has something changed and they can they become a real player with the big boys and girls and uh take advantage of some of these major trends that are happening over the next five years I think it&#39;s going to be the ladder and I think at 45 we&#39;re going to be hodlers to a lot higher 80 90 100 but but now you&#39;ve got an issue in the short term which is a problem which is now they have to go through a pretend search even if they know who they&#39;re going to do they got to drag it out for couple weeks not a couple weeks a couple of months of indecision about who&#39;s going to be the CEO what&#39;s going to be the next plan so it&#39;s be dead money for a couple of months that&#39;s the downside of Ginger being out the upside is if they liquidate it tomorrow we get all of our money back and probably a couple more bucks um and then the intrinsic value is a double on the Legacy business and um and maybe a five plus bagger if they actually get their head on straight get the right person doing it and the joke is going to be that probably everything gelsinger laid out comes to pass and someone else gets the credit and um and that&#39;ll be fine too so uh so that&#39;s that&#39;s the story on Intel China&#39;s leaders plan to discuss GDP Target and stimulus next week that is on Wednesday closed door Central economic work conference economic targets and stimulus plans for 2025 so you can see they&#39;re doing the same exact Playbook that they did in 2016 after the inauguration they weaken the Yuan and they say okay put on another 10% tariffs we&#39;ll just lower the value of our currency by another 10% and have no net effect on our economy uh and then after he gets inaugurated then you know the the game gets back on Trump looks good has noet effect on China because they&#39;ve lowered their currency against it and then the tariffs wind up being less the Yuan appreciates the dollar weekends and We&#39;re Off to the Races with emerging markets in China same story different year Alibaba Cloud aims high in Southeast Asia in 2025 with new AI Partners they&#39;re dominating Indonesia Thailand other markets CEOs are getting tossed out at a record Pace that is the opportunity for us we love it in Intel we love it in Advanced Auto Parts we love it in PayPal by the way which no one&#39;s talking about we love it in Boeing we love it in um I mean it&#39;s it&#39;s almost turnaround Tom&#39;s Playbook I mean every company I get involved in is the new CEO we love it in uh Este louder we&#39;re getting a new CEO um what else what are we missing here gener did it with the same CEO Cooper sard&#39;s going to do it with the same CEO uh um gxo is going to get a new CEO that that&#39;s that&#39;s good um and what else anyway so that&#39;s a good thing that&#39;s a catalyst for change especially when they get the right guys in there like Alex Chris like Shane o Kelly like so many others that we&#39;ve talked about uh Intel considers Outsiders for CEO including Marvel&#39;s head Marvel said no but lip Buu ton for my money that would be the miracle Choice uh makes two to much sense they won&#39;t do it but look when you have 65 and 85% of certain markets look they&#39;ve worked overtime to try to screw it up but it&#39;s very hard to destroy that and um if they can get someone with a pulse and a heartbeat in uh and catch a catch the next Cy upgrade cycle it&#39;s going to make a lot of money even if they&#39;ve got you know basically a weekend up Joe Biden could run the company and it would it would recover back to 45 I don&#39;t know if it would recover back I don&#39;t know if it would go to 80 or 90 on the new plan but he could run it uh and it would definitely rebound back to 4045 so that that tells you everything you need to know gxo spurns acquisition offers as CEO Wilson steps down\n\n### TECHNICAL_CHARTS\nhere&#39;s the chart several months ago we discussed a new position in albam Maro basis 9322 it&#39;s not a large uh position yet because of the time of initiation there was limited excess uninvested Capital to put to work as new capital came in price ran away from us we don&#39;t buy up we do think we will get additional opportunities to size up this position as more data comes in maybe today we didn&#39;t add yet today but we I&#39;d like to see it back in the 90s before I started to look to size up um but if not we&#39;re okay with what we have Alam Maro is in keeping with our theme to find more materials exposure in 2025 as the sector has been decimated and earnings growth is expected to recover handsomely estimates are for 18.9% earnings growth uh up from 18.7 just a few months ago for 2025 Alba Mar&#39;s primary business is lithium production we can see below the Stock&#39;s most recent Spike and collapse in price from 21 to 24 correlates with the spike and drop of the price of lipian carbonate so car lithium carbonate ripped higher collapsed albam Maro stock price ripped higher collapsed I I generally avoid commodity stocks for this very reason basically because you got to get two things right you got to get the commodity right and you got to get the company operations right um that&#39;s with the exception of oil and natural gas stocks when I can buy the commodity cheaper on the New York Stock Exchange than in the fields I learned that tactic from Reading uh John Paul Getty&#39;s legendary book how to be rich highly recommend for everyone however when you look at Alba maro&#39;s long-term price chart the correlation unravels Alba Marl has historically has a moat around its business which when executing at proper levels can mint money irrespective of the price of the underlying commodity so if you look in the short term you see yeah this huge blip that huge blip actually this one was the 2016 to 18 blip uh and this one was the 2020 to 24 blip um but if you go back further then you had like 10 years and you still had a business That Grew From $5 a share to $65 a share with effectively flat lithium carbonate prices China&#39;s appetite for EVS shows no sign of abating even if in North America sales have softened of late if these estimates prove to be 25% true albamar will not not be able to handle all the demand required in coming years reminds me of Boeing Boeing Boeing&#39;s got 10 years of backlog that&#39;s what&#39;s albam Maro is going to be uh based on current trends Bloomberg NF forecast that by 2027 annual Global sales of Passenger EVS will top 30 million rising to 73 million by 20 40 penetration rates will hit 33% in 2027 73% in 2040 I think that&#39;s optimistic between 2024 to 2027 kager is expected to be around 21% a sharp drop from the 20 to 2023 surge EV stock will grow from 41 million at the end of 2023 to 132 Million by 2027 from their lips to God uh Cooper standard has I believe 20 more per Parts capacity on EV than they do on IES so they make 20% more per car but if you look at this when you look at the American part of this uh you can see why we have such a jaded view like we you can&#39;t even see us on this map rest of the world like you can&#39;t even see where America fits in on this growth all the growth is in China and China&#39;s been pushing the EV so if the government&#39;s pushing it just like they&#39;ll push it to over capacity but again where the Arms Dealer so just like we love selling the sealers and the fluid transfer systems and the fuel delivery of Cooper standard to the oems who are going to race to the bottom overproduce and cut margins like it&#39;s going out of style um same thing with the lithium producer albam Maro let them oversupply flood the market with EVS we benefit from all the lithium required to go in and we&#39;re buying it like Buffett said oh in this one four available at a very attractive price that is the key that most people forget um so you can see again it&#39;s it&#39;s all about China EV demand that&#39;s going to that&#39;s going to benefit lithium that&#39;s going to benefit albam Maro and uh uh as the West Begins to acknowledge the recovery in China as it continues to proliferate and sentiment changes everything with any tie into China is going to go through the roof whether that&#39;s Starbucks whether that&#39;s Estee louder whether that&#39;s her whether that&#39;s Nike whether that&#39;s Lulu whether that&#39;s Alibaba whether that&#39;s albam Maro SE louder uh they&#39;re going to go so fast and it&#39;s going to it&#39;s not going to let anyone in so whether that&#39;s the wec meeting and they say we&#39;re going to do 5% GDP and we&#39;re going to do the stimulus to actually get it done uh or it&#39;s the next meeting or who knows uh or it&#39;s just the inflection into January 1 like it was after Trump got elected last time uh it&#39;s really immaterial the key is it&#39;s imminent and what you see here in the long-term Alber uh albam Maro data 2024 was an aberration due to short-term Global lithium overc capacity which is what happens in commodity cyclical businesses but if you look back sales are sales per share are still much higher than 2021 uh approaching 2022 levels next year we&#39;ll be back to 22 levels 2023 was an aberration and you came off the boil so if you draw out the long-term average trend line uh it&#39;s it&#39;s doing fine okay and certainly they got cut off at the kneecaps but the price reflects that so you know you have a stock that dropped from $327 to $71 okay and with huge leverage around the prices of lithium which are at or near historic lows in the short term and the Chinese government is not going to let up on EVS because that puts a lot of people to work that&#39;s their initiative and they&#39;re going to push it uh till the cows come home which is going to help the Chinese economy Chinese manufacturing and it&#39;s going to help albam Maro so um you could see here in the value line estimates they&#39;re expecting a recovery and then a reexpansion out to 2027 2029 but historically you look at this business and the return on Capital has been solid High single digits low double digits for a decade plus return on Equity uh even higher uh net profit solid operating margins in the in the low to mid 20s [Music] um they pay out a little dividend while you wait earnings per share have been growing they peaked in 2022 they&#39;ll recover back uh cash flow per share is hanging in there we&#39;ll be cash flow positive again next year so all the things are in the perfect situation for a turnaround Tom special\n\n### MISCELLANEOUS\nsame CEO Cooper

    "MEDIA_APPEARANCE_RECAP": "\n\nthis was Louis Vuitton by the way which is also another beaten down luxury stock that depends on the China recovery which will happen \n### MEDIA_APPEARANCE_RECAP\nwe're going to listen in now for a general overview to kick this off and then we'll be back big deal all right let's turn now to some interesting investment place to consider as the market rally potentially broadens beh Beyond big Tech into 2025 Thomas Hayes is with us he's the chairman of managing member of great Hill Capital Tom it's great to see you so um we were just talking about that broadening Trend if you were had to pick now between large cap Tech and everything else what are you picking I think you follow the earnings Julie and thank you for having me on what we've seen since the first quarter of this year is the mag 7 earnings growth has decelerated from 50% earnings growth in the first quarter of this year to Mid teens and what we're also seeing is the unmagnify have accelerated from negative aggregate earnings growth to positive and by early next year they will be low double digits to Mid teen so you want to follow the earnings and uh and the unmagnify I think that's where you're going to see things happen Tom it's uh well good to see you uh it's been a little while \n### FEATURED_COMPANY_DEEP_DIVES\nlook it's a holiday shopping season give people some uh presents in terms of some stock picks what do you like what don't you like well I think the biggest surprise of 2025 is going to be that bonds get bid okay we've seen since bessent Scott bessent was appointed as treasury secretary uh and he put in his 333 plan the 3% real GDP budget deficits below 3% and add 3 million barrels per day uh bonds have come yields have come in so that's an opportunity to buy a little longer out on the curve as for stocks as for Christmas presents I got a perfect one for you actually maybe two if we have time I've got Etsy. Etsy has been left for dead Etsy was a covid darling the stock is down 85% but what most people don't realize it's the third most trafficed retail website 92 million users and what's really interesting about that Brian is that they don't compete it's not a race to the bottom on prices because the things you can get on Etsy you can get nowhere else and this is a company that while the stock is down 85% they've been able to maintain all the users they picked up during covid and maintain the free cash flow generation is reaccelerating 600 million plus trailing 12 months a billion doll buyback authorization growth in international growth in men's growth in gifting growth in loyalty programs we like this one\n\nd certainly they got cut off at the kneecaps but the price reflects that so you know you have a stock that dropped from $327 to $71 okay and with huge leverage around the prices of lithium which are at or near historic lows in the short term and the Chinese government is not going to let up on EVS because that puts a lot of people to work that&#39;s their initiative and they&#39;re going to push it uh till the cows come home which is going to help the Chinese economy Chinese manufacturing and it&#39;s going to help albam Maro so um you could see here in the value line estimates they&#39;re expecting a recovery and then a reexpansion out to 2027 2029 but historically you look at this business and the return on Capital has been solid High single digits low double digits for a decade plus return on Equity uh even higher ### FEATURED_COMPANY_DEEP_DIVES\n\nand by the way speaking of turnaround Tom specials uh I was going to speak about Etsy on uh claiming countdown today I got bumped till next Tuesday which I&#39;ll be doing live from California for the first time pretty excited to do that um and etsy&#39;s up you know in the blink of an eye again some of these things slow some of them fast from $49 basis to $59 in a matter of weeks uh any fundamental reason for you know 20% plus move in a few weeks no okay uh so it&#39;s just how it works buy good businesses at attractive prices Take the Long View some happen faster some happen slower but over a a book of 10 to 12 good companies you&#39;re going to outperform over time is really what it comes down to uh as so we&#39;ll go through a couple of these bullets because we&#39;ve got a lot of questions  this week as electric vehicle adoption increases we expect double- digit annual growth in global lithium demand generate healthy bromine profits due to its low cost position in the Dead Sea they have the lowest cost um production of bromine uh let&#39;s see here lithium prices will rebound and then remain well above the marginal cost of production to at least the remainder of the decade leading to excess profits and return on invested capital for albam Maro um their Chilean operation is among the world&#39;s lowest cost sources of lithium they have their own salt brine Assets in Chile and the United States and two joint V interests in Australian mines talison green brush bushes and wagina they do the energy storage largest producer one of the world&#39;s largest producers of lithium for battery applications including electric vehicles diverse portfolio of Highly specialized lithium and bromine Solutions and then a lader in refining and petrochemical catalysts they&#39;ve taken a broad set of actions to maintain their long-term competitive position since July and you can see that they&#39;ve hit most of their milestones and they&#39;ve got upside for more they&#39;ve taken a couple hundred million dollar of cost out um and they&#39;re going to get to three to $400 million of cost out they&#39;ve taken their capex down their balance sheet is great they&#39;ve got 3.4 billion of liquidity with $1.7 billion of cash and cash equivalent a $ 1.5 billion revolver so solvency risk is off the table which is a critical thing in turnaround Tom&#39;s checklist of turnarounds uh and um lithium as lithium battery pack prices come down their demand goes up demand out to 2030 you can see here cost advantages resources improving existing resources and accessing non-conventional with direct lithium extraction which will be online next year uh breakthrough OEM opportunities for greater than 50% more EV range with battery material in ation and then the bromine concentration they have in the Dead Sea concentrate in Arkansas is Extreme relative to other places in the world and their industrial cost curve for the elemental bromine is the cheapest in the world where they have the deposits um allocating Capital to the highest return opportunities in sustainability and productivity consistently achieving returns above two times their weighted average cost of capital Target that&#39;s what we like to see the high return on invested Capital over their weighted average cost of capital Global EV demand growth 23% year-to date so we in America it feels like EVS are slowing uh but in China they&#39;re going faster than ever and that&#39;s why you see Elon Musk spending all of his time over in China and focus on China so lithium doesn&#39;t care where it has to go the key is that the overall number in the world is going up and China will be exporting tons of EVS to everywhere in the world except for the United States uh and that will continue to help Alam Maro um so their volumes and energy storage and Specialties were up 16% and 4% respectively jused iov 21 million even in the worst environment cash from operations 241 million and then you can see here the sensitivity to the price of lithium as the price of lithium normalizes the impact on eida you basically get Triple the ebit op for double the price I mean it&#39;s it&#39;s insane uh again this is not fear and greed index not at a level of extreme where you want to get out of everything or even much of anything for that matter ### MEDIA_APPEARANCE_RECAP\n\nclayman&#39;s next Tuesday at 300 PM instead of today I&#39;ll be speaking at the money show on Saturday so I&#39;ll be down there Thursday for dinner uh Wednesday afternoon and a little bit of Friday afternoon for any existing clients or new potential clients that want to meet for a coffee reach out through the contact form and earnings materials uh this is why it&#39;s beat down estimates down 5.6% in the last 60 days growth IBD growth stocks top 30 weights last 60 days revised up 12.88 that&#39;s why you&#39;re going to see Ark continue to do okay and recover Like a Phoenix From the Ashes uh earnings turning up estimates turning up and Industrial manufacturing PMI came in better than expected so we&#39;ve talked about this job openings were better than expected Etc so the jobs report is critical on Friday and let&#39;s get back to the",
    "FEATURED_COMPANY_DEEP_DIVES": "\n\nthis was Louis Vuitton by the way which is also another beaten down luxury stock that depends on the China recovery which will happen \n### MEDIA_APPEARANCE_RECAP\nwe're going to listen in now for a general overview to kick this off and then we'll be back big deal all right let's turn now to some interesting investment place to consider as the market rally potentially broadens beh Beyond big Tech into 2025 Thomas Hayes is with us he's the chairman of managing member of great Hill Capital Tom it's great to see you so um we were just talking about that broadening Trend if you were had to pick now between large cap Tech and everything else what are you picking I think you follow the earnings Julie and thank you for having me on what we've seen since the first quarter of this year is the mag 7 earnings growth has decelerated from 50% earnings growth in the first quarter of this year to Mid teens and what we're also seeing is the unmagnify have accelerated from negative aggregate earnings growth to positive and by early next year they will be low double digits to Mid teen so you want to follow the earnings and uh and the unmagnify I think that's where you're going to see things happen Tom it's uh well good to see you uh it's been a little while \n### FEATURED_COMPANY_DEEP_DIVES\nlook it's a holiday shopping season give people some uh presents in terms of some stock picks what do you like what don't you like well I think the biggest surprise of 2025 is going to be that bonds get bid okay we've seen since bessent Scott bessent was appointed as treasury secretary uh and he put in his 333 plan the 3% real GDP budget deficits below 3% and add 3 million barrels per day uh bonds have come yields have come in so that's an opportunity to buy a little longer out on the curve as for stocks as for Christmas presents I got a perfect one for you actually maybe two if we have time I've got Etsy. Etsy has been left for dead Etsy was a covid darling the stock is down 85% but what most people don't realize it's the third most trafficed retail website 92 million users and what's really interesting about that Brian is that they don't compete it's not a race to the bottom on prices because the things you can get on Etsy you can get nowhere else and this is a company that while the stock is down 85% they've been able to maintain all the users they picked up during covid and maintain the free cash flow generation is reaccelerating 600 million plus trailing 12 months a billion doll buyback authorization growth in international growth in men's growth in gifting growth in loyalty programs we like this one\n\nBenjamin Graham individuals who cannot Master their emotions are ill suited to profit from the investment process look at Market fluctuations as your friend rather than your enemy profit from Folly rather than participated that&#39;s from Warren Buffett we&#39;re going to talk about some of that Folly today Peter Lynch everyone has the brain power to make money in stocks not everyone has the stomach if you are susceptible to selling everything in a panic you ought to avoid stocks and mutual funds all together\n### QUOTES_OF_THE_WEEK\nlook at fluctuations as your friend rather than your enemy for instance today gxo Logistics uh that thing had traded up you know we were talking about it in the low 50s and high 40s on this uh podcast for a while and then it just shot up to the low 60s on rumors that the company was going to get bought out at whatever 25% premium and everyone was so excited I said that&#39;s the worst thing that could ever happen to us as investors I didn&#39;t get into this to make 10 or 20 or $30 which would be you know $30 if they got it they probably would have taken it at 80 uh which would have been a 60% gain which would have meant we had to pay pay ordinary income taxes on a gain much lower than our expected value of the business over the next 3 years and uh and I voic my concern uh to the company I said look if you&#39;re not getting 80 this is a dumb deal and I&#39;m really surprised that it would even be considered\n### FEATURED_COMPANY_DEEP_DIVES\nand we own a position in qxo and we own a position uh in gxo uh a big position which got a lot bigger this morning so um I&#39;m pretty excited about that I usually don&#39;t buy on the first day down I&#39;ll probably be be able to top up a little more than next few days but um I&#39;m super excited that they didn&#39;t sell it and I&#39;m more excited that I was able to get more people more positioning uh where available uh across the accounts today and take advantage of that opportunity and that&#39;s what we talk about looking at the market fluctuations as your friend rather than your enemy more people probably sold it uh because all the people were in for hot money to make five bucks on a deal and they got smoked which I&#39;m super happy about uh we don&#39;t need those own type of owners in the business and mastering the emotions who would buy a stock that gets pounded in a day other than turnaround Tom uh and in some accounts we were actually able to some we we were able to pick up some shares in the uh below 51 today uh in which case in some accounts we brought down the basis which was pretty excited and uh and some below 52 some below 51 uh but look anything below 100 I think in this stock over the next three years is going to be a bargain so excited about that um here are some of the indicators so yeah we&#39;re stretched but you know you look at the extremes we&#39;re not really at the extremes before a crash we are at levels of enthusiasm you see during bull markets and honestly we haven&#39;t had a protracted one for some time\n### MACRO_DATA_SLIDES\nlook at materials in healthc care which we&#39;re going to talk a little bit about today number one biotech we&#39;ve owned we talked about we love that that&#39;s going to be huge in 2025 uh and uh healthc care uh materials albam Marl we&#39;re going to talk about today that was down today it&#39;s funny in my article I wrote you know it wasn&#39;t as big of a position as we would like because when we were putting it on several months ago and we talked about on the podcast uh one there was a limit where we had capacity we were pretty fully invested\n### TECHNICAL_CHARTS\nArc we talked about a few weeks ago we said watch out she&#39;s going to be like a phoenix From the Ashes was weak after the election in 2016 took off 2017 and she starting to take off Baba what did it do after Trump got elected in 16 kept selling down which is what it&#39;s been doing before the inauguration on January 1 as soon as the calendar year turned and the tax loss selling was done went straight up and never looked back from $84 to $187 in 11 months uh I think we could see a similar repeat of that and I think that&#39;s going to be one of the most shocking trades for 2025 the other shocking trade is that bonds are going to get bid let&#39;s we&#39;ll show you some of these other things momentum stocks did did well uh um small caps we covered China stock same thing as Baba traded all the way down after Trump got elected right before he got inaugurated straight up and never looked back double in uh 11 months and that&#39;s an index by the way equal weighted did fine uh semiconductors did fine uh S&P 500 just ground higher so I mean you look at this situation strong after the election with Trump then a little grind iness in December and January and February and then it just kept pushing higher we&#39;ll see we&#39;ll see on that on the indices uh solar again you know sold off after Trump got elected after the inauguration again choppy for a few months and then started to take back off I think solar is going to do a lot better under Trump than it did under Biden which is counterintuitive uh biotech same story a little weakness after the election a lot of strength uh after the inauguration\n### MISCELLANEOUS\nmaterials same thing we want more materials exposure we&#39;ll talk about Alam Maro on that today and uh hopefully we get another few bad days on Alam Maro so we can make it a real position but um uh Today Was a Good Start uh XLE same thing people think it&#39;ll be strong probably won&#39;t be as strong as people think certainly in that first year financials they&#39;ve moved up a lot I think they&#39;re going to be more sideways than up in the short term and probably second half when that IPO machine uh cranks will be better\n\n### HEADLINES_AND_NEWS\nstimulus bets Drive Chinese stocks higher before key meeting uh Jack ma returns to Alibaba campus as China moves to boost business

traffic did they do it here uh okay their credit got upgraded but the real reason they were up I think their traffic was up\n\n### FEATURED_COMPANY_DEEP_DIVES\nIntel Intel has more than 65% of the market for traditional PCS and 85% of the server Market Market according to Edward Jones look they&#39;ve screwed up a lot that&#39;s why the Stock&#39;s trading at $20 um I&#39;m I&#39;m not a big fan of the firing of Ginger but I&#39;m also not against it and the reason I&#39;m not against it well here&#39;s the thing he did do the five no he&#39;s going to complete the five nodes in four years he&#39;s doing exactly what he said he was going to do it wasn&#39;t fast enough for the board [Music] um but there are some serious names in contention and one of the names in contention is a guy named lip buan and lip ban got into a company called Cadence Design cdns in January of 2009 and the stock was down 90% % it dropped from $24 to $242 uh from 2008 to 2009 when he got involved the stock then subsequently and he&#39;s still executive chairman by the way has gone from $242 to $328 under his tenure and I will say oh well he just got in at the bot bottom of the cycle he got lucky that&#39;s not the case because the the business had grinded sideways for the previous 15 years and did nothing so it was this guy getting involved that turned it from a sleepy dead company to a money-making machine from 2009 to 2024 uh with uh basically a 60 no 150 bagger it&#39;s not quite 150 bagger it&#39;s like 125 bagger not saying he&#39;s going to do that for Intel I&#39;m not saying he&#39;s going to be the pick but uh if we could bring in someone that would get the street excited I think when the 18a is done next year and they figure out what they want to be when they grow up with a new CEO uh look I know for certain that the business is worth $45 to $50 on the Legacy business and we&#39;ve said that since day one and we got involved we got a run up to $48 we we made a quick double we got out it came back to $29 we started to reinitiate oh and we got lucky lucky uh we had a chance to buy a ton in the High Teens uh and bring our bases back down for the second run at it and it&#39;ll run back up to 45 at some point and then we&#39;re going to decide is it all that it is just a just another double and we&#39;re out uh or has something changed and they can they become a real player with the big boys and girls and uh take advantage of some of these major trends that are happening over the next five years I think it&#39;s going to be the ladder and I think at 45 we&#39;re going to be hodlers to a lot higher 80 90 100 but but now you&#39;ve got an issue in the short term which is a problem which is now they have to go through a pretend search even if they know who they&#39;re going to do they got to drag it out for couple weeks not a couple weeks a couple of months of indecision about who&#39;s going to be the CEO what&#39;s going to be the next plan so it&#39;s be dead money for a couple of months that&#39;s the downside of Ginger being out the upside is if they liquidate it tomorrow we get all of our money back and probably a couple more bucks um and then the intrinsic value is a double on the Legacy business and um and maybe a five plus bagger if they actually get their head on straight get the right person doing it and the joke is going to be that probably everything gelsinger laid out comes to pass and someone else gets the credit and um and that&#39;ll be fine too so uh so that&#39;s that&#39;s the story on Intel China&#39;s leaders plan to discuss GDP Target and stimulus next week that is on Wednesday closed door Central economic work conference economic targets and stimulus plans for 2025 so you can see they&#39;re doing the same exact Playbook that they did in 2016 after the inauguration they weaken the Yuan and they say okay put on another 10% tariffs we&#39;ll just lower the value of our currency by another 10% and have no net effect on our economy uh and then after he gets inaugurated then you know the the game gets back on Trump looks good has noet effect on China because they&#39;ve lowered their currency against it and then the tariffs wind up being less the Yuan appreciates the dollar weekends and We&#39;re Off to the Races with emerging markets in China same story different year Alibaba Cloud aims high in Southeast Asia in 2025 with new AI Partners they&#39;re dominating Indonesia Thailand other markets CEOs are getting tossed out at a record Pace that is the opportunity for us we love it in Intel we love it in Advanced Auto Parts we love it in PayPal by the way which no one&#39;s talking about we love it in Boeing we love it in um I mean it&#39;s it&#39;s almost turnaround Tom&#39;s Playbook I mean every company I get involved in is the new CEO we love it in uh Este louder we&#39;re getting a new CEO um what else what are we missing here gener did it with the same CEO Cooper sard&#39;s going to do it with the same CEO uh um gxo is going to get a new CEO that that&#39;s that&#39;s good um and what else anyway so that&#39;s a good thing that&#39;s a catalyst for change especially when they get the right guys in there like Alex Chris like Shane o Kelly like so many others that we&#39;ve talked about uh Intel considers Outsiders for CEO including Marvel&#39;s head Marvel said no but lip Buu ton for my money that would be the miracle Choice uh makes two to much sense they won&#39;t do it but look when you have 65 and 85% of certain markets look they&#39;ve worked overtime to try to screw it up but it&#39;s very hard to destroy that and um if they can get someone with a pulse and a heartbeat in uh and catch a catch the next Cy upgrade cycle it&#39;s going to make a lot of money even if they&#39;ve got you know basically a weekend up Joe Biden could run the company and it would it would recover back to 45 I don&#39;t know if it would recover back I don&#39;t know if it would go to 80 or 90 on the new plan but he could run it uh and it would definitely rebound back to 4045 so that that tells you everything you need to know gxo spurns acquisition offers as CEO Wilson steps down\n\n### TECHNICAL_CHARTS\nhere&#39;s the chart several months ago we discussed a new position in albam Maro basis 9322 it&#39;s not a large uh position yet because of the time of initiation there was limited excess uninvested Capital to put to work as new capital came in price ran away from us we don&#39;t buy up we do think we will get additional opportunities to size up this position as more data comes in maybe today we didn&#39;t add yet today but we I&#39;d like to see it back in the 90s before I started to look to size up um but if not we&#39;re okay with what we have Alam Maro is in keeping with our theme to find more materials exposure in 2025 as the sector has been decimated and earnings growth is expected to recover handsomely estimates are for 18.9% earnings growth uh up from 18.7 just a few months ago for 2025 Alba Mar&#39;s primary business is lithium production we can see below the Stock&#39;s most recent Spike and collapse in price from 21 to 24 correlates with the spike and drop of the price of lipian carbonate so car lithium carbonate ripped higher collapsed albam Maro stock price ripped higher collapsed I I generally avoid commodity stocks for this very reason basically because you got to get two things right you got to get the commodity right and you got to get the company operations right um that&#39;s with the exception of oil and natural gas stocks when I can buy the commodity cheaper on the New York Stock Exchange than in the fields I learned that tactic from Reading uh John Paul Getty&#39;s legendary book how to be rich highly recommend for everyone however when you look at Alba maro&#39;s long-term price chart the correlation unravels Alba Marl has historically has a moat around its business which when executing at proper levels can mint money irrespective of the price of the underlying commodity so if you look in the short term you see yeah this huge blip that huge blip actually this one was the 2016 to 18 blip uh and this one was the 2020 to 24 blip um but if you go back further then you had like 10 years and you still had a business That Grew From $5 a share to $65 a share with effectively flat lithium carbonate prices China&#39;s appetite for EVS shows no sign of abating even if in North America sales have softened of late if these estimates prove to be 25% true albamar will not not be able to handle all the demand required in coming years reminds me of Boeing Boeing Boeing&#39;s got 10 years of backlog that&#39;s what&#39;s albam Maro is going to be uh based on current trends Bloomberg NF forecast that by 2027 annual Global sales of Passenger EVS will top 30 million rising to 73 million by 20 40 penetration rates will hit 33% in 2027 73% in 2040 I think that&#39;s optimistic between 2024 to 2027 kager is expected to be around 21% a sharp drop from the 20 to 2023 surge EV stock will grow from 41 million at the end of 2023 to 132 Million by 2027 from their lips to God uh Cooper standard has I believe 20 more per Parts capacity on EV than they do on IES so they make 20% more per car but if you look at this when you look at the American part of this uh you can see why we have such a jaded view like we you can&#39;t even see us on this map rest of the world like you can&#39;t even see where America fits in on this growth all the growth is in China and China&#39;s been pushing the EV so if the government&#39;s pushing it just like they&#39;ll push it to over capacity but again where the Arms Dealer so just like we love selling the sealers and the fluid transfer systems and the fuel delivery of Cooper standard to the oems who are going to race to the bottom overproduce and cut margins like it&#39;s going out of style um same thing with the lithium producer albam Maro let them oversupply flood the market with EVS we benefit from all the lithium required to go in and we&#39;re buying it like Buffett said oh in this one four available at a very attractive price that is the key that most people forget um so you can see again it&#39;s it&#39;s all about China EV demand that&#39;s going to that&#39;s going to benefit lithium that&#39;s going to benefit albam Maro and uh uh as the West Begins to acknowledge the recovery in China as it continues to proliferate and sentiment changes everything with any tie into China is going to go through the roof whether that&#39;s Starbucks whether that&#39;s Estee louder whether that&#39;s her whether that&#39;s Nike whether that&#39;s Lulu whether that&#39;s Alibaba whether that&#39;s albam Maro SE louder uh they&#39;re going to go so fast and it&#39;s going to it&#39;s not going to let anyone in so whether that&#39;s the wec meeting and they say we&#39;re going to do 5% GDP and we&#39;re going to do the stimulus to actually get it done uh or it&#39;s the next meeting or who knows uh or it&#39;s just the inflection into January 1 like it was after Trump got elected last time uh it&#39;s really immaterial the key is it&#39;s imminent and what you see here in the long-term Alber uh albam Maro data 2024 was an aberration due to short-term Global lithium overc capacity which is what happens in commodity cyclical businesses but if you look back sales are sales per share are still much higher than 2021 uh approaching 2022 levels next year we&#39;ll be back to 22 levels 2023 was an aberration and you came off the boil so if you draw out the long-term average trend line uh it&#39;s it&#39;s doing fine okay and certainly they got cut off at the kneecaps but the price reflects that so you know you have a stock that dropped from $327 to $71 okay and with huge leverage around the prices of lithium which are at or near historic lows in the short term and the Chinese government is not going to let up on EVS because that puts a lot of people to work that&#39;s their initiative and they&#39;re going to push it uh till the cows come home which is going to help the Chinese economy Chinese manufacturing and it&#39;s going to help albam Maro so um you could see here in the value line estimates they&#39;re expecting a recovery and then a reexpansion out to 2027 2029 but historically you look at this business and the return on Capital has been solid High single digits low double digits for a decade plus return on Equity uh even higher uh net profit solid operating margins in the in the low to mid 20s [Music] um they pay out a little dividend while you wait earnings per share have been growing they peaked in 2022 they&#39;ll recover back uh cash flow per share is hanging in there we&#39;ll be cash flow positive again next year so all the things are in the perfect situation for a turnaround Tom special\n\n### MISCELLANEOUS\nsame CEO Cooper sard&#39;s going to do it with the same CEO uh um gxo is going to get a new CEO that that&#39;s that&#39;s good um and what else anyway so that&#39;s a good thing that&#39;s a catalyst for change

acquisition offers as CEO Wilson steps down uh we covered that are we up to oh wow we&#39;re up to the article of the week all right covered that covered that\n\nd certainly they got cut off at the kneecaps but the price reflects that so you know you have a stock that dropped from $327 to $71 okay and with huge leverage around the prices of lithium which are at or near historic lows in the short

### FEATURED_COMPANY_DEEP_DIVES\n\nand by the way speaking of turnaround Tom specials uh I was going to speak about Etsy on uh claiming countdown today I got bumped till next Tuesday which I&#39;ll be doing live from California for the first time pretty excited to do that um and etsy&#39;s up you know in the blink of an eye again some of these things slow some of them fast from $49 basis to $59 in a matter of weeks uh any fundamental reason for you know 20% plus move in a few weeks no okay uh so it&#39;s just how it works buy good businesses at attractive prices Take the Long View some happen faster some happen slower but over a a book of 10 to 12 good companies you&#39;re going to outperform over time is really what it comes down to uh as so we&#39;ll go through a couple of these bullets because we&#39;ve got a lot of questions  this week as electric vehicle adoption increases we expect double- digit annual growth in global lithium demand generate healthy bromine profits due to its low cost position in the Dead Sea they have the lowest cost um production of bromine uh let&#39;s see here lithium prices will rebound and then remain well above the marginal cost of production to at least the remainder of the decade leading to excess profits and return on invested capital for albam Maro um their Chilean operation is among the world&#39;s lowest cost sources of lithium they have their own salt brine Assets in Chile and the United States and two joint V interests in Australian mines talison green brush bushes and wagina they do the energy storage largest producer one of the world&#39;s largest producers of lithium for battery applications including electric vehicles diverse portfolio of Highly specialized lithium and bromine Solutions and then a lader in refining and petrochemical catalysts they&#39;ve taken a broad set of actions to maintain their long-term competitive position since July and you can see that they&#39;ve hit most of their milestones and they&#39;ve got upside for more they&#39;ve taken a couple hundred million dollar of cost out um and they&#39;re going to get to three to $400 million of cost out they&#39;ve taken their capex down their balance sheet is great they&#39;ve got 3.4 billion of liquidity with $1.7 billion of cash and cash equivalent a $ 1.5 billion revolver so solvency risk is off the table which is a critical thing in turnaround Tom&#39;s checklist of turnarounds uh and um lithium as lithium battery pack prices come down their demand goes up demand out to 2030 you can see here cost advantages resources improving existing resources and accessing non-conventional with direct lithium extraction which will be online next year uh breakthrough OEM opportunities for greater than 50% more EV range with battery material in ation and then the bromine concentration they have in the Dead Sea concentrate in Arkansas is Extreme relative to other places in the world and their industrial cost curve for the elemental bromine is the cheapest in the world where they have the deposits um allocating Capital to the highest return opportunities in sustainability and productivity consistently achieving returns above two times their weighted average cost of capital Target that&#39;s what we like to see the high return on invested Capital over their weighted average cost of capital Global EV demand growth 23% year-to date so we in America it feels like EVS are slowing uh but in China they&#39;re going faster than ever and that&#39;s why you see Elon Musk spending all of his time over in China and focus on China so lithium doesn&#39;t care where it has to go the key is that the overall number in the world is going up and China will be exporting tons of EVS to everywhere in the world except for the United States uh and that will continue to help Alam Maro um so their volumes and energy storage and Specialties were up 16% and 4% respectively jused iov 21 million even in the worst environment cash from operations 241 million and then you can see here the sensitivity to the price of lithium as the price of lithium normalizes the impact on eida you basically get Triple the ebit op for double the price I mean it&#39;s it&#39;s insane uh again this is not fear and greed index not at a level of extreme where you want to get out of everything or even much of anything for that matter ### MEDIA_APPEARANCE_RECAP\n\nclayman&#39;s next Tuesday at 300 PM instead of today I&#39;ll be speaking at the money show on Saturday so I&#39;ll be down there Thursday for dinner uh Wednesday afternoon and a little bit of Friday afternoon for any existing clients or new potential clients that want to meet for a coffee reach out through the contact form and earnings materials uh this is why it&#39;s beat down estimates down 5.6% in the last 60 days growth IBD growth stocks top 30 weights last 60 days revised up 12.88 that&#39;s why you&#39;re going to see Ark continue to do okay and recover Like a Phoenix From the Ashes uh earnings turning up estimates turning up and Industrial manufacturing PMI came in better than expected so we&#39;ve talked about this job openings were better than expected Etc so the jobs report is critical on Friday and let&#39;s get back to the\n\n### FEATURED_COMPANY_DEEP_DIVES\nreally like the business so while you're probably right um I didn't want to be involved because there was still solvency risk medical Property Trust mpw I mean I don't I don't know where the turnaround comes from the the the free cash flow deterioration shows no end in sight revenues are having I mean this looks like a cigar butt maybe you'll get one last puff out of it for a trade but unless you can get confidence in the turnaround like what has happened to this business um I think you're playing with fire let's take a closer look here so I got 275 million of cash and $9.2 billion of debt I mean yes that debt is secured by assets how much assets we have here 10 billion so you basically got in theory yeah I I don't like this I think I think you got I'd have to spend a lot of time on it but I think you got close to enough solvency risk and if it's close to enough and it's a lower quality business I don't want to play there even if if the trade could be a double or triple if they pull it off um I think you're playing with fire here I would avoid even though the trade will probably work in the short term in the long term it's not a good business \n### HEADLINES_AND_NEWS\nall right so a guy I'm not going to say his name sent me like basically a statement uh um Intel CEO

impatient because they all want to keep their $300,000 a year jobs for showing up for four meetings that's number one um gouty GPU ships currently disappointing winter takes all business blah blah blah it's not a winner takes all business in the short term it always is until they get um competition it's the same with the gp1s it'll be the same with these chips uh so that's a false premise uh in

    "### FEATURED_COMPANY_DEEP_DIVES": "\n\naccelerated from negative aggregate earnings growth to positive and by early next year they will be low double digits to Mid teen so you want to follow the earnings and uh and the unmagnify I think that's where you're going to see things happen. I think the biggest surprise of 2025 is going to be that bonds get bid okay we've seen since bessent Scott bessent was appointed as treasury secretary uh and he put in his 333 plan the 3% real GDP budget deficits below 3% and add 3 million barrels per day uh bonds have come yields have come in so that's an opportunity to buy a little longer out on the curve as for stocks as for Christmas presents I got a perfect one for you actually maybe two if we have time I've got Etsy. Etsy has been left for dead Etsy was a covid darling the stock is down 85% but what most people don't realize it's the third most trafficed retail website 92 million users and what's really interesting about that Brian is that they don't compete it's not a race to the bottom on prices because the things you can get on Etsy you can get nowhere else and this is a company that while the stock is down 85% they've been able to maintain all the users they picked up during covid and maintain the free cash flow generation is reaccelerating 600 million plus trailing 12 months a billion doll buyback authorization growth in international growth in men's growth in gifting growth in loyalty programs we like this one. concerns about um that it hasn't maintained that level of specialness right that there are counterfeit Goods on there that it's not as curated Etc what do you think about that do you think etsy's been doing a good job of sort of addressing some of those concerns no and yes no they haven't been doing a good job that's why the stock's down 85% yes they recognize the mistakes they made and they're fixing it and that's why we're seeing a re acceleration of growth revenues proper initiatives curation and uh and an abandonment of what they were doing which was trying to compete with people that they don't compete with. Julie and I were having a chat on on tech stocks and uh seeing some weakness in the semiconductor names is there any read through any cautionary signs from some of these stocks that were some of the favorites amongst investors now getting tossed in the trash well as it relates to Nvidia we we saw a lot of retail uh investors Chase into that after the split uh they got some benefits but you know at the end of the day you have a stock that's priced for Perfection trading at some 40 times sales 40 times forward earnings a lot has to go right and the problem is there was a period in time when Nvidia the stock price went up and it actually got cheaper because the multiple went down that is no longer the case because profit margins have Tapped Out uh Revenue growth has capped out at a measly $4 billion doar a quarter which is still absolutely incredible but uh the key is price is what you pay value is what you get and at 40 time sales as we move from training the models which is where gpus are the most critical and the spend for gpus is the most important thing two the more efficient part of the AI process which we're slowly shifting into which is inference inference can be done on more basic chips with lower energy use lower demand uh more chips but lower quality chips that's where the amds of the world and the intels of the world are going to start to arise from the dead and the and the p is going to be split up a little bit better so uh on that basis maybe they can e out a couple more quarters of stock growth but uh where it's priced I think uh it's it's certainly makes sense that it's consolidating and stalling a little bit and maybe even pulling back. I want to come back to your bond call because I find that kind of interesting Tom because there are of of course all this talk about tariffs maybe keeping rates meaning the inflation's going to stay higher meaning that rates are going to stay higher for longer we're not going to see as many Cuts how does that factor into what you're expecting well this was the exact same thing that happened in Trump 1.0 he was elected in November of 2016 the first thing you saw was oh it's going to be inflationary he's going to spend he's the debt king or the you know the bond King uh and and immediately uh long end of the curb sold off aggressively after the election and into his inauguration and it was kind of sell the rumor by the news when he actually got in bonds had a meaningful rally in 2017 same thing with the dollar as soon as he was elected it had this knee-jerk strength all the way into January into the inauguration and then weakness and I think those are going to be two big surprises in 2025 bonds get bid yields compressed dollar actually re weakens maybe not the next few weeks but as you look out six to nine months that will be the case and if you look at the inflation during the Trump 1.0 Administration it was subdued there were a lot of different conditions I'll give you that history does not repeat it does rhyme but the other thing that was odd about uh uh 2017 to 2020 is uh Emerging Markets did exceptionally well when he was a pro tariff the tarff king he ran on the Tariff King and Emerging Markets had really tremendous rallies as the dollar weakened so I would be open-minded and the other thing that people think energy is going to do great energy did very poorly under the Trump Administration and so did retail stocks after initial rally into the inauguration retail stocks were very weak in that first year probably on the fear of tariffs as well so uh I would just be burdened by the facts and the data versus the hearsay of what might happen or perceptions about what would happen look at what actually happened and see where the conditions are similar and where they might be different and I think there's a tremendous opportunities in the next 12 months in doing that.",

six to nine months that will be the case and if you look at the inflation during the Trump 1.0 Administration it was subdued there were a lot of different conditions I&#39;ll give you that history does not repeat it does rhyme but the other thing that was odd about uh uh 2017 to 2020 is uh Emerging Markets did exceptionally well when he was a pro tariff the tarff king he ran on the Tariff King and Emerging Markets had really tremendous rallies as the dollar weakened so I would be open-minded and the other thing that people think energy is going to do great energy did very poorly under the Trump Administration and so did retail stocks after initial rally into the inauguration retail stocks were very weak in that first year probably on the fear of tariffs as well so uh I would just be burdened by the facts and the data versus the hearsay of what might happen or perceptions about what would happen look at what actually happened and see where the conditions are similar and where they

get bought out at whatever 25% premium and everyone was so excited I said that&#39;s the worst thing that could ever happen to us as investors I didn&#39;t get into this to make 10 or 20 or $30 which would be you know $30 if they got it they probably would have taken it at 80 uh which would have been a 60% gain which would have meant we had to pay pay ordinary income taxes on a gain much lower

xus and three Cuts us where do you want to place your bets ladies and gentlemen where the 121 cuts are happening or where the three cuts are happening so again this is um stuff to pay attention to and in those periods where you had these massive Cuts you saw the benefits of xus Emerging Markets during those years you can go back and trace it um okay again from dri S&P returns Final six months went up 10 okay we covered that December gains after 20% plus um have averaged you know you had 4.4 2.9 2.4 1.8 5.1 so what they&#39;re saying here is  similar to what Tom Lee is saying like we could finish the year at 6,300\n### MACRO_DATA_SLIDES\nmanufacturing Outlook brightens across several US regions we&#39;ve been talking about this theme you look at the uh different Regional manufacturing results we are coming out of the manufacturing recession and that&#39;s going to fuel the next phase of the bull market which has been in a depression manufacturing ISM Manufacturing turning up new orders turning up private construction turning up uh this is interesting ISM Manufacturing PMI has lagged cyclicals uh over defense and that&#39;s going to play Massive catchup on the uh pmis Japan corporate profits rolling over to negative again people couldn&#39;t get enough China and um excuse me people couldn&#39;t get enough India and Japan at the exact wrong time and sure enough rolling over Russell 2000 this actually broke out small caps broke out just beginning uh Global manufacturing PMI turning up from negative so that that points to X us uh biggest exporters interestingly enough uh China exports 3.4 trillion a year we only export two trillion a year Japan shockingly is only 700 billion and India is only 400 billion so uh South Korea is a big exporter that&#39;s why we watch them a lot um and so on it&#39;s good to see that in color uh S&P index around election day you get this pop up then December early pullback whether we&#39;ve seen that already I don&#39;t know and then push up and then grind sideways so we&#39;ll see uh federal government spending you can see by category Social Security being the highest health care net interest this they&#39;re going to bring rates down Medicare National Defense income security veterans benefits so we&#39;ll see what VC and uh Elon can do over last four decades November through January has been the strongest period for the Russell 2000 I think that continues December&#39;s been the best month for small relative to large caps I think we&#39;re going to see a follow through on that despite today was led by Tech because CRM said the word Ai and their results and everyone got excited um and OCTA S&P 500 monthly seasonality for all years so here&#39;s a color visual of what we talked about earlier December July April and January are all good months so you know I wouldn&#39;t get too an to sell until mid until the inauguration January 20th is generally where I&#39;d be looking second third fourth week uh for things that are super fully valued for things that are not valued forget this timing nonsense and seasonality nonsense you sell it when it&#39;s when it&#39;s met your targets which you should have discerned before you even got into the position every single position we know where we&#39;re getting out before we get in the only thing that changes that calculus is if the facts change and the fundamentals get better or worse than we anticipated where they&#39;d be three years out uh but we&#39;ve modeled it and we know where where we&#39;re going um and when we want to get there so uh manufacturing PMI oh this is interesting price indicator suggests deflationary pressures eased in November this is China went from negative to positive that&#39;s a big deal same thing with manufacturing PA PMI from contraction to expansion so all the things in the stimulus that people are impatient about are coming through would we like direct consumer stimulus yes they&#39;re going to have another big meeting expectations are so low because every big meeting they the bed maybe this time it&#39;ll be different because no one expects anything here&#39;s Jeffrey H who I was talking about the stock Traders Almanac you should buy one by the way if you don&#39;t have one teach you a lot about seasonality and historical data I think it&#39;s good to have um choppy first half of December before a yearend rally so basically you rise up a little bit on average um through the 10th then weak into the 13th 14th 15th and then the yearend rally called the Santa Claus rally last five seven days of the year job openings rise and more workers quit in sign of improving US Labor Market um so that&#39;s good that was a little bit worrisome and there was another fed speaker out earlier in the week who said the word skip which was a little concerning to me but it seems like Powell put the market at ease today with what he said and now we&#39;ve got the odds but that&#39;s kind of meaningless until we get the jobs number um the initial numbers pointed to a number that&#39;s going to be supportive of doing a cut in De December and I think that would just be really set the stage and after that if you&#39;re asking for a lot more Cuts after that you&#39;re kind of being greedy I think if they frontload them the way they&#39;ve been doing you know one is plenty wait three months see how the data comes in one or two next year and let the let the machine run Wards Automotive US Auto Sales SAR this is at 16.5 what&#39;s really interesting if you if you look at it from like a chared standpoint you can see here in 2017 and 18 it got 18 got up over 18 million according to this data um well that okay that was a monthly but the annual came out at 17.1 Blended because you see they had some months at 16 then shot over 18 so 171 when they earned $719 a share so we just got a month above 165 this is amazing cuz like you know the chartist would say oh it\n\nAdvanced Auto Parts I hadn&#39;t planned to talk about it they got a debt downgrade duh uh this week it sold off and now it&#39;s back up 10% from where it sold off to which is pretty exciting to see so it was a final sell uh people selling in the hole and uh all the all the weak money&#39;s out now and uh Shane Shane o Kelly can can go execute on the dense plan in the number one and two month markets which we talked about two weeks ago super excited about that one city economic surprise index rolling over a little bit in the Euro Zone a little bit weaker so we keep an eye on that Peak growth priced for the Magnificent 7 last time they were that high was the end of 2021 uh you had a big correction in 2022 in Tech so I think that&#39;s the I think that&#39;s the area to keep your eye on in 2025 if you&#39;re going to have any pain maybe it&#39;ll be in some of those selected names us which will keep the indices subdued and opportunity under the surface again 3.3 standard deviations This Is Us boom versus global bust go ahead and bet against that but if you don&#39;t take advantage of asymmetric opportunities with some portion of your portfolio you&#39;re never going to get seriously rich I mean the these are what wet dreams in the financial markets are made out of is taking asymmetric Bets with a limited side that has maximum upside Limited downside uh and if you do it with low leverage you can wait until it\n### MACRO_DATA_SLIDES\nfinally  realizes in the irrs are through the roof all day long these gifts don&#39;t come around many times in a career Bank of America forecasting 100 we got that capex

years 2009 off the extreme lows shoots all the way up by 2011 everyone&#39;s too optimistic it goes for another 10 years um same thing in the early 90s off this extreme low gets too extended everyone says people are too optimistic goes another nine years so you just have to know how to interpret these patterns because often it&#39;s it&#39;s not even that people don&#39;t have the data it&#39;s that they interpret it wrong and um corporate Insider buys is another bearish case if they there&#39;s you know they&#39;re least interest in Insider buys but we showed the data that shows they&#39;re

    "TECHNICAL_CHARTS": "\n\nBenjamin Graham individuals who cannot Master their emotions are ill suited to profit from the investment process look at Market fluctuations as your friend rather than your enemy profit from Folly rather than participated that&#39;s from Warren Buffett we&#39;re going to talk about some of that Folly today Peter Lynch everyone has the brain power to make money in stocks not everyone has the stomach if you are susceptible to selling everything in a panic you ought to avoid stocks and mutual funds all together\n### QUOTES_OF_THE_WEEK\nlook at fluctuations as your friend rather than your enemy for instance today gxo Logistics uh that thing had traded up you know we were talking about it in the low 50s and high 40s on this uh podcast for a while and then it just shot up to the low 60s on rumors that the company was going to get bought out at whatever 25% premium and everyone was so excited I said that&#39;s the worst thing that could ever happen to us as investors I didn&#39;t get into this to make 10 or 20 or $30 which would be you know $30 if they got it they probably would have taken it at 80 uh which would have been a 60% gain which would have meant we had to pay pay ordinary income taxes on a gain much lower than our expected value of the business over the next 3 years and uh and I voic my concern uh to the company I said look if you&#39;re not getting 80 this is a dumb deal and I&#39;m really surprised that it would even be considered\n### FEATURED_COMPANY_DEEP_DIVES\nand we own a position in qxo and we own a position uh in gxo uh a big position which got a lot bigger this morning so um I&#39;m pretty excited about that I usually don&#39;t buy on the first day down I&#39;ll probably be be able to top up a little more than next few days but um I&#39;m super excited that they didn&#39;t sell it and I&#39;m more excited that I was able to get more people more positioning uh where available uh across the accounts today and take advantage of that opportunity and that&#39;s what we talk about looking at the market fluctuations as your friend rather than your enemy more people probably sold it uh because all the people were in for hot money to make five bucks on a deal and they got smoked which I&#39;m super happy about uh we don&#39;t need those own type of owners in the business and mastering the emotions who would buy a stock that gets pounded in a day other than turnaround Tom uh and in some accounts we were actually able to some we we were able to pick up some shares in the uh below 51 today uh in which case in some accounts we brought down the basis which was pretty excited and uh and some below 52 some below 51 uh but look anything below 100 I think in this stock over the next three years is going to be a bargain so excited about that um here are some of the indicators so yeah we&#39;re stretched but you know you look at the extremes we&#39;re not really at the extremes before a crash we are at levels of enthusiasm you see during bull markets and honestly we haven&#39;t had a protracted one for some time\n### MACRO_DATA_SLIDES\nlook at materials in healthc care which we&#39;re going to talk a little bit about today number one biotech we&#39;ve owned we talked about we love that that&#39;s going to be huge in 2025 uh and uh healthc care uh materials albam Marl we&#39;re going to talk about today that was down today it&#39;s funny in my article I wrote you know it wasn&#39;t as big of a position as we would like because when we were putting it on several months ago and we talked about on the podcast uh one there was a limit where we had capacity we were pretty fully invested\n### TECHNICAL_CHARTS\nArc we talked about a few weeks ago we said watch out she&#39;s going to be like a phoenix From the Ashes was weak after the election in 2016 took off 2017 and she starting to take off Baba what did it do after Trump got elected in 16 kept selling down which is what it&#39;s been doing before the inauguration on January 1 as soon as the calendar year turned and the tax loss selling was done went straight up and never looked back from $84 to $187 in 11 months uh I think we could see a similar repeat of that and I think that&#39;s going to be one of the most shocking trades for 2025 the other shocking trade is that bonds are going to get bid let&#39;s we&#39;ll show you some of these other things momentum stocks did did well uh um small caps we covered China stock same thing as Baba traded all the way down after Trump got elected right before he got inaugurated straight up and never looked back double in uh 11 months and that&#39;s an index by the way equal weighted did fine uh semiconductors did fine uh S&P 500 just ground higher so I mean you look at this situation strong after the election with Trump then a little grind iness in December and January and February and then it just kept pushing higher we&#39;ll see we&#39;ll see on that on the indices uh solar again you know sold off after Trump got elected after the inauguration again choppy for a few months and then started to take back off I think solar is going to do a lot better under Trump than it did under Biden which is counterintuitive uh biotech same story a little weakness after the election a lot of strength uh after the inauguration\n### MISCELLANEOUS\nmaterials same thing we want more materials exposure we&#39;ll talk about Alam Maro on that today and uh hopefully we get another few bad days on Alam Maro so we can make it a real position but um uh Today Was a Good Start uh XLE same thing people think it&#39;ll be strong probably won&#39;t be as strong as people think certainly in that first year financials they&#39;ve moved up a lot I think they&#39;re going to be more sideways than up in the short term and probably second half when that IPO machine uh cranks will be better\n\n### HEADLINES_AND_NEWS\nexpectations are so low because every big meeting they the bed maybe this time it&#39;ll be different because no one expects anything here&#39;s Jeffrey H who I was talking about the stock Traders Almanac you should buy one by the way if you don&#39;t have one teach you a lot about seasonality and historical data I think it&#39;s good to have um choppy first half of December before a yearend rally so basically you rise up a little bit on average um through the 10th then weak into the 13th 14th 15th and then the yearend rally called the Santa Claus rally last five seven days of the year job openings rise and more workers quit in sign of improving US Labor Market um so that&#39;s good that was a little bit worrisome and there was another fed speaker out earlier in the week who said the word skip which was a little concerning to me but it seems like Powell put the market at ease today with what he said and now we&#39;ve got the odds but that&#39;s kind of meaningless until we get the jobs number um the initial numbers pointed to a number that&#39;s going to be supportive of doing a cut in De December and I think that would just be really set the stage and after that if you&#39;re asking for a lot more Cuts after that you&#39;re kind of being greedy I think if they frontload them the way they&#39;ve been doing you know one is plenty wait three months see how the data comes in one or two next year and let the let the machine run\n### TECHNICAL_CHARTS\nWards Automotive US Auto Sales SAR this is at 16.5 what&#39;s really interesting if you if you look at it from like a chared standpoint you can see here in 2017 and 18 it got 18 got up over 18 million according to this data um well that okay that was a monthly but the annual came out at 17.1 Blended because you see they had some months at 16 then shot over 18 so 171 when they earned $719 a share so we just got a month above 165 this is amazing cuz like you know the chartist would say oh it finally  broke out from this 2-year consolidation from 2023 to 2024 th this is really good news ladies and gentlemen so I&#39;m excited\n### HEADLINES_AND_NEWS\ngxo Logistics this was a note out from steel thanks to my friends over there I know we&#39;ve got a lot of listeners um so gxo backs away from buyout talks and announces plan CEO retirement next year I thought last week&#39;s was going to be short it was like two hours by the way last week&#39;s was one of the better ones of the year uh this week&#39;s we&#39;ve got so much stuff to cover I I thought it was going to be a half hour call again um retirement next year fundamental thesis unchanged and what they do they talk about multiple on you know 950 of adjusted eida for 2025 uh multiple 11 to 12 times which yields North to 7 $70 a share so they&#39;ve got a 12mon price Target of $74 which is 21 times their 2025 EPS estimate at 345 no change there I think that&#39;s going to surprise to the upside and again I think it&#39;s a $100 stock over the next few years um us light vehicle sales to prize on the high side again in November if you remember September was weak October was great November&#39;s great make car sales great again over the LA over half of borrowing by smaller nonpublic businesses is linked to short-term rates so that&#39;s good for refinancing uh we get another cut I think if you see Cooper standard is going to cash pay their debt this quarter and if they can be cash flow positive in this quarter and you get another cut into year end I think they could Finance the whole slug of debt in the first quarter of next year at advantageous rates and then maybe do it again A year later and uh and then just roll it out to 2030 which we don&#39;t need we need three to four years for this thing to hit if that I mean at the rate things are going we&#39;re going to hit 17 SAR a lot quicker than anticipated and $7 of earnings maybe faster than anticipated and uh you know we understand what kind of businesses is although with the technology ad I think they&#39;re going to smooth out some of the cyclicality but um um anyway very exciting on that one city economic surprising by the way interesting thing about Advanced Auto Parts I hadn&#39;t planned to talk about it they got a debt downgrade duh uh this week it sold off and now it&#39;s back up 10% from where it sold off to which is pretty exciting to see so it was a final sell uh people selling in the hole and uh all the all the weak money&#39;s out now and uh Shane Shane o Kelly can can go execute on the dense plan in the number one and two month markets which we talked about two weeks ago super excited about that one city economic surprise index rolling over a little bit in the Euro Zone a little bit weaker so we keep an eye on that Peak growth priced for the Magnificent 7 last time they were that high was the end of 2021 uh you had a big correction in 2022 in Tech so I think that&#39;s the I think that&#39;s the area to keep your eye on in 2025 if you&#39;re going to have any pain maybe it&#39;ll be in some of those selected names us which will keep the indices subdued and opportunity under the surface again 3.3 standard deviations This Is Us boom versus global bust go ahead and bet against that but if you don&#39;t take advantage of asymmetric opportunities with some portion of your portfolio you&#39;re never going to get seriously rich I mean the these are what wet

the server Market Market according to Edward Jones look they&#39;ve screwed up a lot that&#39;s why the Stock&#39;s trading at $20 um I&#39;m I&#39;m not a big fan of the firing of Ginger but I&#39;m also not against it and the reason I&#39;m not against it well here&#39;s the thing he did do the five no he&#39;s going to complete the five nodes in four years he&#39;s doing exactly what he said he was going to do it wasn&#39;t fast enough for the board [Music] um but there are some serious names in contention and one of the names in contention is a guy named lip buan and lip ban got into a company called Cadence Design cdns in January of 2009 and the stock was down 90% % it dropped from $24 to $242 uh from 2008 to 2009 when he got involved the stock then subsequently and he&#39;s still executive chairman by the way has gone from $242 to $328 under his tenure and I will say oh well he just got in at the bot bottom of the cycle he got lucky that&#39;s not the case because the the business had grinded sideways for the previous 15 years and did nothing so it was this guy getting involved that turned it from a sleepy dead company to a money-making machine from 2009 to 2024 uh with uh basically a 60 no 150 bagger it&#39;s not quite 150 bagger it&#39;s like 125 bagger not saying he&#39;s going to do that for Intel I&#39;m not saying he&#39;s going to be the pick but uh if we could bring in someone that would get the street excited I think when the 18a is done next year and they figure out what they want to be when they grow up with a new CEO uh look I know for certain that the business is worth $45 to $50 on the Legacy business and we&#39;ve said that since day one and we got involved we got a run up to $48 we we made a quick double we got out it came back to $29 we started to reinitiate oh and we got lucky lucky uh we had a chance to buy a ton in the High Teens uh and bring our bases back down for the second run at it and it&#39;ll run back up to 45 at some point and then we&#39;re going to decide is it all that it is just a just another double and we&#39;re out uh or has something changed and they can they become a real player with the big boys and girls and uh take advantage of some of these major trends that are happening over the next five years I think it&#39;s going to be the ladder and I think at 45 we&#39;re going to be hodlers to a lot higher 80 90 100 but but now you&#39;ve got an issue in the short term which is a problem which is now they have to go through a pretend search even if they know who they&#39;re going to do they got to drag it out for couple weeks not a couple weeks a couple of months of indecision about who&#39;s going to be the CEO what&#39;s going to be the next plan so it&#39;s be dead money for a couple of months that&#39;s the downside of Ginger being out the upside is if they liquidate it tomorrow we get all of our money back and probably a couple more bucks um and then the intrinsic value is a double on the Legacy business and um and maybe a five plus bagger if they actually get their head on straight get the right person doing it and the joke is going to be that probably everything gelsinger laid out comes to pass and someone else gets the credit and um and that&#39;ll be fine too so uh so that&#39;s that&#39;s the story on Intel China&#39;s leaders plan to discuss GDP Target and stimulus next week that is on Wednesday closed door Central economic work conference economic targets and stimulus plans for 2025 so you can see they&#39;re doing the same exact Playbook that they did in 2016 after the inauguration they weaken the Yuan and they say okay put on another 10% tariffs we&#39;ll just lower the value of our currency by another 10% and have no net effect on our economy uh and then after he gets inaugurated then you know the the game gets back on Trump looks good has noet effect on China because they&#39;ve lowered their currency against it and then the tariffs wind up being less the Yuan appreciates the dollar weekends and We&#39;re Off to the Races with emerging markets in China same story different year Alibaba Cloud aims high in Southeast Asia in 2025 with new AI Partners they&#39;re dominating Indonesia Thailand other markets CEOs are getting tossed out at a record Pace that is the opportunity for us we love it in Intel we love it in Advanced Auto Parts we love it in PayPal by the way which no one&#39;s talking about we love it in Boeing we love it in um I mean it&#39;s it&#39;s almost turnaround Tom&#39;s Playbook I mean every company I get involved in is the new CEO we love it in uh Este louder we&#39;re getting a new CEO um what else what are we missing here gener did it with the same CEO Cooper sard&#39;s going to do it with the same CEO uh um gxo is going to get a new CEO that that&#39;s that&#39;s good um and what else anyway so that&#39;s a good thing that&#39;s a catalyst for change especially when they get the right guys in there like Alex Chris like Shane o Kelly like so many others that we&#39;ve talked about uh Intel considers Outsiders for CEO including Marvel&#39;s head Marvel said no but lip Buu ton for my money that would be the miracle Choice uh makes two to much sense they won&#39;t do it but look when you have 65 and 85% of certain markets look they&#39;ve worked overtime to try to screw it up but it&#39;s very hard to destroy that and um if they can get someone with a pulse and a heartbeat in uh and catch a catch the next Cy upgrade cycle it&#39;s going to make a lot of money even if they&#39;ve got you know basically a weekend up Joe Biden could run the company and it would it would recover back to 45 I don&#39;t know if it would recover back I don&#39;t know if it would go to 80 or 90 on the new plan but he could run it uh and it would definitely rebound back to 4045 so that that tells you everything you need to know gxo spurns acquisition offers as CEO Wilson steps down\n\n### TECHNICAL_CHARTS\nhere&#39;s the chart several months ago we discussed a new position in albam Maro basis 9322 it&#39;s not a large uh position yet because of the time of initiation there was limited excess uninvested Capital to put to work as new capital came in price ran away from us we don&#39;t buy up we do think we will get additional opportunities to size up this position as more data comes in maybe today we didn&#39;t add yet today but we I&#39;d like to see it back in the 90s before I started to look to size up um but if not we&#39;re okay with what we have Alam Maro is in keeping with our theme to find more materials exposure in 2025 as the sector has been decimated and earnings growth is expected to recover handsomely estimates are for 18.9% earnings growth uh up from 18.7 just a few months ago for 2025 Alba Mar&#39;s primary business is lithium production we can see below the Stock&#39;s most recent Spike and collapse in price from 21 to 24 correlates with the spike and drop of the price of lipian carbonate so car lithium carbonate ripped higher collapsed albam Maro stock price ripped higher collapsed I I generally avoid commodity stocks for this very reason basically because you got to get two things right you got to get the commodity right and you got to get the company operations right um that&#39;s with the exception of oil and natural gas stocks when I can buy the commodity cheaper on the New York Stock Exchange than in the fields I learned that tactic from Reading uh John Paul Getty&#39;s legendary book how to be rich highly recommend for everyone however when you look at Alba maro&#39;s long-term price chart the correlation unravels Alba Marl has historically has a moat around its business which when executing at proper levels can mint money irrespective of the price of the underlying commodity so if you look in the short term you see yeah this huge blip that huge blip actually this one was the 2016 to 18 blip uh and this one was the 2020 to 24 blip um but if you go back further then you had like 10 years and you still had a business That Grew From $5 a share to $65 a share with effectively flat lithium carbonate prices China&#39;s appetite for EVS shows no sign of abating even if in North America sales have softened of late if these estimates prove to be 25% true albamar will not not be able to handle all the demand required in coming years reminds me of Boeing Boeing Boeing&#39;s got 10 years of backlog that&#39;s what&#39;s albam Maro is going to be uh based on current trends Bloomberg NF forecast that by 2027 annual Global sales of Passenger EVS will top 30 million rising to 73 million by 20 40 penetration rates will hit 33% in 2027 73% in 2040 I think that&#39;s optimistic between 2024 to 2027 kager is expected to be around 21% a sharp drop from the 20 to 2023 surge EV stock will grow from 41 million at the end of 2023 to 132 Million by 2027 from their lips to God uh Cooper standard has I believe 20 more per Parts capacity on EV than they do on IES so they make 20% more per car but if you look at this when you look at the American part of this uh you can see why we have such a jaded view like we you can&#39;t even see us on this map rest of the world like you can&#39;t even see where America fits in on this growth all the growth is in China and China&#39;s been pushing the EV so if the government&#39;s pushing it just like they&#39;ll push it to over capacity but again where the Arms Dealer so just like we love selling the sealers and the fluid transfer systems and the fuel delivery of Cooper standard to the oems who are going to race to the bottom overproduce and cut margins like it&#39;s going out of style um same thing with the lithium producer albam Maro let them oversupply flood the market with EVS we benefit from all the lithium required to go in and we&#39;re buying it like Buffett said oh in this one four available at a very attractive price that is the key that most people forget um so you can see again it&#39;s it&#39;s all about China EV demand that&#39;s going to that&#39;s going to benefit lithium that&#39;s going to benefit albam Maro and uh uh as the West Begins to acknowledge the recovery in China as it continues to proliferate and sentiment changes everything with any tie into China is going to go through the roof whether that&#39;s Starbucks whether that&#39;s Estee louder whether that&#39;s her whether that&#39;s Nike whether that&#39;s Lulu whether that&#39;s Alibaba whether that&#39;s albam Maro SE louder uh they&#39;re going to go so fast and it&#39;s going to it&#39;s not going to let anyone in so whether that&#39;s the wec meeting and they say we&#39;re going to do 5% GDP and we&#39;re going to do the stimulus to actually get it done uh or it&#39;s the next meeting or who knows uh or it&#39;s just the inflection into January 1 like it was after Trump got elected last time uh it&#39;s really immaterial the key is it&#39;s imminent and what you see here in the long-term Alber uh albam Maro data 2024 was an aberration due to short-term Global lithium overc capacity which is what happens in commodity cyclical businesses but if you look back sales are sales per share are still much higher than 2021 uh approaching 2022 levels next year we&#39;ll be back to 22 levels 2023 was an aberration and you came off the boil so if you draw out the long-term average trend line uh it&#39;s it&#39;s doing fine okay and certainly they got cut off at the kneecaps but the price reflects that so you know you have a stock that dropped from $327 to $71 okay and with huge leverage around the prices of lithium which are at or near historic lows in the short term and the Chinese government is not going to let up on EVS because that puts a lot of people to work that&#39;s their initiative and they&#39;re going to push it uh till the cows come home which is going to help the Chinese economy Chinese manufacturing and it&#39;s going to help albam Maro so um you could see here in the value line estimates they&#39;re expecting a recovery and then a reexpansion out to 2027 2029 but historically you look at this business and the return on Capital has been solid High single digits low double digits for a decade plus return on Equity uh even higher uh net profit solid operating margins in the in the low to mid 20s [Music] um they pay out a little dividend while you wait earnings per share have been growing they peaked in 2022 they&#39;ll recover back uh cash flow per share is hanging in there we&#39;ll be cash flow positive again next year so all the things are in the perfect situation for a turnaround Tom special\n\n### MISCELLANEOUS\nsame CEO Cooper sard&#39;s going to do it with the same CEO uh um gxo is going to get a new CEO

in America it feels like EVS are slowing uh but in China they're going faster than ever and that's why you see Elon Musk spending all of his time over in China and focus on China so lithium doesn't care where it has to go the key is that the overall number in the world is going up and China will be exporting tons of EVS to everywhere in the world except for the United States uh and that will continue to help Alam Maro um so their volumes and energy storage and Specialties were up 16% and 4% respectively jused iov 21 million even in the worst environment cash from operations 241 million and then you can see here the sensitivity to the price of lithium as the price of lithium normalizes the impact on eida you basically get Triple the ebit op for double the price I mean it's it's insane uh again this is not fear and greed index not at a level of extreme where you want to get out of everything or even much of anything for that matter um earnings materials uh this is why it's beat down estimates down 5.6% in the last 60 days growth IBD growth stocks top 30 weights last 60 days revised up 12.88 that's why you're going to see Ark continue to do okay and recover Like a Phoenix From the Ashes uh earnings turning up estimates turning up and Industrial manufacturing PMI came in better than expected so we've talked about this job openings were better than expected [Music] um Etc so the jobs report is critical on Friday and let's get back to the\n### ASK_ME_ANYTHING_QA\nask me anything\n\n### ASK_ME_ANYTHING_QA\nquestions  so for those of you who don&#39;t like the\n\n### ASK_ME_ANYTHING_QA\nask me anything question part thank you for tuning in we'll be back next week live from California for the first time this week was from New York City uh and for those of you who do like to\n\n--- OVERLAP CONTINUED ---\n\nask me anything\n\nuh let&#39;s get started uh no name asks hey Tom love your videos what do you think about French stocks like AXA BNP party boss Society General at the moment I would never consider European Bank they&#39;re the biggest garbage businesses in the history of humanity um and next week I&#39;ll tell you how I really feel about European banks with the exception of UBS which is a high quality business that a good friend works at uh but um and ah Deutsche Bank no but but stock CH and B&amp;P uh you couldn&#39;t it&#39;s it&#39;s the worst combination of everything you could ever imagine it&#39;s a cultural cess pool that I want in aggregate there are fantastic people at every Bank individual people I like I respect the whole thing in aggregate they&#39;re just credit s part two ### ASK_ME_ANYTHING_QA\nuh go to hedge fund tips.com click on terms we don&#39;t know your financial situation we deal exclusively with accredited investors and qualified clients and uh institutions talk to your financial adviser before you do anything in a short period of time I&#39;ve learned a lot and hope one day to become a client of yours we&#39;ll be here when you&#39;re ready I would value your view on the following mwp medical properties trust seems to have bottomed in a major turnaround whilst deleveraging could be two or 3x I think we looked at this one a few weeks ago and for me uh there was some solvency risk and I don&#39;t really like the business so while you&#39;re probably right um I didn&#39;t want to be involved because there was still solvency risk medical Property Trust mpw I mean I don&#39;t I don&#39;t know where the turnaround comes from the the the free cash flow deterioration shows no end in sight revenues are having I mean this looks like a cigar butt maybe you&#39;ll get one last puff out of it for a trade but unless you can get confidence in the turnaround like what has happened to this business um I think you&#39;re playing with fire let&#39;s take a closer look here so I got 275 million of cash and $9.2 billion of debt I mean yes that debt is secured by assets how much assets we have here 10 billion so you basically got in theory yeah I I don&#39;t like this I think I think you got I&#39;d have to spend a lot of time on it but I think you got close to enough solvency risk and if it&#39;s close to enough and it&#39;s a lower quality business I don&#39;t want to play there even if if the trade could be a double or triple if they pull it off um I think you&#39;re playing with fire here I would avoid even though the trade will probably work in the short term in the long term it&#39;s not a good business um all right so a guy I&#39;m not going to say his name sent me like basically a statement uh um Intel CEO resigns no kidding expected to stay at least until 18a was out the door next year maybe he knows something we don&#39;t he didn&#39;t resign he got his ass kicked out the door because the board became impatient because they all want to keep their $300,000 a year jobs for showing up for four meetings that&#39;s number one um gouty GPU ships currently disappointing winter takes all business blah blah blah it&#39;s not a winner takes all business in the short term it always is until they get um competition it&#39;s the same with the gp1s it&#39;ll be the same with these chips uh so that&#39;s a false premise uh in any reasonable time frame in the minute if you read the\n\nthat&#39;s correct it&#39;s incorrect if you look study anything past a year history uh are Intel&#39;s problems too big to fix by Dan Gallagher in the Wall Street Journal sure Intel is strategic for the US and has defense contracts but it also needs to survive and thrive as a business so that was it he sent a period And I just replied back and I said is there a question or have you already made up your mind and he and he said I wanted to know if you changed your view so first off thank you for listening to our podcast second off thank you for sending a question third nothing&#39;s changed I I honestly don&#39;t think they had to fire gelsinger um but I think there&#39;s a possibility that because they did his planning his plan coming through under a different face will get the stock accelerated much faster than his plan coming through under his own face and I know that sounds silly but there&#39;s sentiment around him and there&#39;s so much failure baked around him with the pro problems that he inherited and couldn&#39;t turn the ship around fast enough that I think even if the ship turned around people wouldn&#39;t believe it uh whereas a new face like the guy I talked about who&#39;s got a huge track record of success when that 18a hits next year and the uh five nodes in four years plays out he&#39;ll get all the credit even though Ginger laid all the foundation and the market will believe it because they&#39;re not looking at all the money they lost under Ginger uh and the hatred they have for that they will be looking at new face new results New outcomes so it may improve prove our irr meaning it will take a lot less time any bit of good news with a new face will be believed and bought whereas any good news under Ginger people would say oh it&#39;s just a fake out this guy loses every time blah blah blah blah blah so uh I think it&#39;ll be a net positive in that regard CK says big fan of the Pod take a look at newor uh I don&#39;t like steel stocks no interest next Jason Z can you look at IM kta this is a special situation this takes a lot longer to look at than five minutes it&#39;s like a land holding m kta real estate company Moonlighting add a commercial Plaza lease operator and grocery stores throughout the Carolinas all right let&#39;s take a look here the balance sheet and see what kind of credit&#39;s given for this 3600 acres of land one half billion dollar 500 million at debt longterm uh let&#39;s see if they&#39;re generating any cash 100 million revenues are growing earnings are growing so I would like to find out what did they make some big acquisition or something to get this earnings jump um I mean there are two businesses I don&#39;t really like supermarket and these kind of like land plays that take 10 years to like St Joe&#39;s and Howard Hughes Corp it&#39;s just just takes forever to work out and it&#39;s just dead money and they hire better uses so I&#39;m going to pass on this one I like the creativity but it&#39;s not for me uh cork asked me to go speak to his students which I probably will in January in California JP would love to hear your thoughts on Pags I know we&#39;ve covered before take another look the new look is no um what&#39;s changed you&#39;re never going to know what Consumer loans are in that on that balance sheet you no way you&#39;re ever going to know so you can gamble on it the trade will probably work cash flow is turning negative price is priced for death um so then you got to do some solv analysis but you really don&#39;t know what you&#39;re holding because of all the off balance sheet Consumer Debt uh and credit receivables and there&#39;s no way you&#39;re going to get transparency on this and keep burning free cash so uh I have any cash 132 million I think it&#39;s I think it&#39;s like more than a coin flip bankruptcy and if it works it&#39;ll go to like 30 so you do asymmetry like that with like 1% 2% position if you lose you lose 2% of your portfolio if you if you win you make 4X so you make 8% total contribution I I just I don&#39;t want to play there ### ASK_ME_ANYTHING_QA Stone energy same story this is from uh Saar we&#39;ve covered this before and the answer was no wait Stone Co rather again negative cash flow you still have a bad government situation in in Brazil I mean if you have to take a bet on one of these two I would take it on Stone Co for sure this one might actually warrant some work so I just want to understand why the cash is getting burned and what&#39;s going to change about that anytime soon they have a decent enough balance sheet that they can withstand some I want to understand like what&#39;s the turnaround situation who is running it when it was at 95 who&#39;s running it now what&#39;s their plan to turn it around this one is probably worth doing some work work um I think Buffett owned it for a minute I don&#39;t think he owns anymore so I want to take a look at this if I want Brazilian exposure this one might be the one to look at but no high conviction there yet Martin schling from Vienna Austria schleig schn uh listening to you for a longer time now already well hopefully future investor uh do for my Austrian holding thank you very much for your insights made really nice profits over the last 18 months already good uh video cast is so much fun to listen in all right uh thank you comp you grab okay c m p u g r o u b got hit it hard ctm let&#39;s see comp you group there it is ealth Services worldwide ambulatory Information Systems impatient software again I mean it&#39;s very tough to tell if they have an actual mode of their business uh let&#39;s take a look it&#39;s been a lowquality business for a lot of years I don&#39;t see why that would change $80 million of cash8 they got 80 million of cash and 800 of long-term debt no bueno cash flow is positive free cash flow and what&#39;s happening with the revenues so they must have done a big acquisition here so it&#39;s a broken covid stock um a lot of these broken covid stocks are coming back like Etsy like PayPal like gener uh so there might be something here uh I think that okay so they named a new CEO in May he was chief officer at the German ealth company prior to the oh he was the CFO so they put the CFO in so you just have to understand his turnaround story and why their software has a an impenetrable Moe uh and that takes a lot more work than just looking at the financials um so first thing you want to start to study is who are their competitors and have they been gaining or losing share and try to understand the technology mod which is and I&#39;m not dismissing it this is it&#39;s a very hard exercise and this is why Buffett for so many years avoided software and technology companies um is because the barriers to entry are low and you just have to understand how the software works and why it can&#39;t be disrupted and that&#39;s a hard hard ask um if you can buy it with enough margin of safety that&#39;s a good thing it looks like this thing is turning so I like your your thought process but you really have to understand it otherwise you just put it in the too hard bin Matt tumau thoughts on Intel&#39;s new CEO the interim it&#39;s just a placeholder uh no thoughts uh we&#39;re not going to know anything for two months so don&#39;t expect miracles unless they panic and appoint the guy who I want from Cadence and they do it quickly um but boards never do that they don&#39;t get paid by the uh the hour miles Frasier really enjoying the podcast wanted to get your thoughts on two stocks JD and Dollar General uh Dollar General we&#39;ve been looking at for a while I think we would probably be more inclined to go with Dollar Tree we&#39;re not doing that because we have enough exposure with a similar low-end consumer cons retailer called Advanced Auto Parts which we like but if we didn&#39;t own Advanced Auto Parts we&#39;d probably take a very serious look at both of Dollar Tree and Dollar General I think they&#39;re going to recover uh and I think it&#39;s going to make time I love the fact that they&#39;re beat down over the Tariff fears because they&#39;re going to be worse than advertised uh better than advertised rather than less less bad uh njd I think that um uh JD JD&#39;s fine but I&#39;d rather play it through Baba because they&#39;ve got the cloud business so um leave it there uh next question comes from thanks miles Alex Ward uh trmd which is a shipper shipping companies are garbage um very cyclical we had a nice move on front line at one point I this is a tough business I mean honestly if you&#39;re gonna go into shipping you&#39;re best to buy the ships when there&#39;s a glut and wait for the cycle to tighten but um that&#39;s not what we do I&#39;ll take a quick look for you but it&#39;s a good way to lose a lot of money is buying shipper equities I remember all the people Lemmings chasing Zim shipping and it was going to go up forever and um it collapsed Fleet of product tankers in the UK see these land Banks and shipping companies these are the things that people confuse as quality value investing versus deep value or special situations and this type of deep value stuff is what gives value investing a bad name because people get bagged in this stuff for 10 years and it never does anything um I generally wouldn&#39;t touch a shipper unless it&#39;s really like a like a 2009 bottom cycle and I&#39;m pretty confident that they&#39;re not going to go bankrupt I understand what you&#39;re seeing here I&#39;m just telling you that there ways to lose a lot of money shippers are are one miners are another this this does look like it&#39;s getting better but to your point you say that Howard marks is currently the main shareholder in selling large chunks of stock which are affecting the share price so he doesn&#39;t need to sell why is he selling what does he know that you don&#39;t know and I don&#39;t I generally don&#39;t want to be on the other side of a trade with Howard marks which is why it interests me that Howard marks is buying the hell out of China ### ASK_ME_ANYTHING_QA why d peer buying the hell out of China so uh higher and better uses I think your thinking framework Alex got you to a good place I just think you&#39;re in the wrong sector to play that game even if the stock price goes up it&#39;s like you&#39;re in a sector where the odds are against you to win from a historical standpoint you get lucky from time to time and make multi-baggers but uh you&#39;ll give it back to the casino because it&#39;s it&#39;s an unsound uh place to allocate Capital Sophie have you looked at wind Resorts new UAE project seems like it would get a boost from the company um when is a China play we&#39;re playing it through Baba I think it&#39;s okay here I don&#39;t think you&#39;re going to get an easy double and we prefer doubles and triples that are pretty easy and pretty predictable with the risk being time and irr that doesn&#39;t really qualify um but it&#39;s a good company ### ASK_ME_ANYTHING_QA Greg says thanks for the analysis on diio I&#39;ve been working on opco what do you think I think it&#39;s a I think it&#39;s a garbage spec play that only has any credibility because Phil Frost has been dumping tons of money in it for years and years and years uh and Phil Frost started tea and he was an investor major investor at the first hedge fund that I worked at and he&#39;s a super smart guy and he&#39;s made a ton of money and this thing he&#39;s been bagged in for literally 16 17 years buying it up at 19 buying it down at a dollar so he obviously thinks it can work he&#39;s one of the smartest Minds in biotech so you have to gamble on if he is he going to be right in the next 18 days or is he going to be right in the next 18 years and I have no Edge on that which is why we own xbi and we&#39;ll take our simple over a few years and uh be Off to the Races but this thing tell me what your Edge is and I&#39;ll tell you whether you should be involved and uh uh for me there I have no Edge on that one Tim Ted do um this is one of the covid Darlings that&#39;s probably starting to show signs of Life everyone&#39;s copying it I don&#39;t really know what the mode is Amazon tried to get into the business everything&#39;s accelerating here ### ASK_ME_ANYTHING_QA um PD I mean this is probably one let&#39;s take a look financials income statement H who put this on quarterly that&#39;s why okay half of my numbers were off because this was switched to quarterly versus annual sorry about that um so revenues are decelerating never good on a Momo stock free cash flow is okay balance sheet 1.2 billion balance sheets okay just don&#39;t understand why they&#39;re losing so much uh what is the charge that let&#39;s see here $2 billion on 300 million of free cash flow with flat sales ### ASK_ME_ANYTHING_QA um look it&#39;s obviously more reasonably priced uh the key is are there any Catalyst for change ### ASK_ME_ANYTHING_QA um let me see what they&#39;re doing with the free cash flow are they buying in shares or are they issuing shares they keep issuing shares or giving shares to themselves I mean the share counts gone from 42 million to 168 million these this management is a bunch of pigs and uh I don&#39;t like that that&#39;s just a warning sign for me they they have no respect for Equity so I&#39;d look at it and just see what is the competition from other players in the market it might be cheap enough but any management that does this to the Share account I have zero respect for so I&#39;m not going to be involved with operators like that ### ASK_ME_ANYTHING_QA Philipe Andrew pinkos agricultural sector yeah I don&#39;t share all my positions so sorry about that ### ASK_ME_ANYTHING_QA Joseph cont top book recommendations to read for Joseph oberti uh tlick over tlick ### ASK_ME_ANYTHING_QA thanks Joseph start with the intelligent investor by Ben Graham read that if the light bulb doesn&#39;t go off go just go to a different career uh and make a lot of money doing something else uh it&#39;s just not for everyone ### ASK_ME_ANYTHING_QA if that does click read security analysis if that clicks start reading the CFA books if that clicks read every Buffet annual letter that you&#39;ve ever that he&#39;s ever published you can find them on Burkshire halfway. comom and then you can find his partnership letter on the internet margin of safety by Seth claran is is a worthwhile read ### ASK_ME_ANYTHING_QA um you can be a stock market genius by Joel green blad is a good read and that should keep you busy for three or four months and after that you can send back another question I&#39;ve read all that stuff what do you recommend next ### ASK_ME_ANYTHING_QA uh okay next is Mark Sher with the breath you expect outside the mag 7 people could play that with an equal weight or better with individual names are you aware of an exotic product that tracks to 493 I&#39;m not interested in exotic products that is a formula for cash incineration it exotic equals cash incinerator and it&#39;s your cash that&#39;s going to be incinerated sooner or later so stick stay away ### ASK_ME_ANYTHING_QA have you looked at Bath and Body Works uh I don&#39;t like this business yes I have we&#39;ve looked at it on the podcast it looks fine I don&#39;t want to be involved ### ASK_ME_ANYTHING_QA bath body works this is bbwi revenues have been dropping cash flow has been dropping pric has been going nowhere there are higher and better uses not not really interested ### ASK_ME_ANYTHING_QA namon want to pick your thoughts on tariffs regarding China Mexico and Canada ### ASK_ME_ANYTHING_QA aate loer we own uh um yeah they were the same fears in 2016 and um Cooper standard had their best year ever in 2017 so I wouldn&#39;t overthink that uh other than that let&#39;s see okay that&#39;s it for this week we&#39;ll be back next T next week uh the normal day on Thursday but new place from California in the meantime make it a great one\n\nthat&#39;s correct it&#39;s incorrect if you look study anything past a year history uh are Intel&#39;s

name because people get bagged in this stuff for 10 years and it never does anything um I generally wouldn&#39;t touch a shipper unless it&#39;s really like a like a 2009 bottom cycle and I&#39;m pretty confident that they&#39;re not going to go bankrupt I understand what you&#39;re seeing here I&#39;m just telling you that there ways to lose a lot of money shippers are are one miners are another this this does look like it&#39;s getting better but to your point you say that Howard marks is currently the main shareholder in selling large chunks of stock which are affecting the share price so he doesn&#39;t need to sell why is he selling what does he know that you don&#39;t know and I don&#39;t I generally don&#39;t want to be on the other side of a trade with Howard marks which is why it interests me that Howard marks is buying the hell out of China ### ASK_ME_ANYTHING_QA why d peer buying the hell out of China so uh higher and better uses I think your thinking framework Alex got you to a good place I just think you&#39;re in the wrong sector to play that game even if the stock price goes up it&#39;s like you&#39;re in a sector where the odds are against you to win from a historical standpoint you get lucky from time to time and make multi-baggers but uh you&#39;ll give it back to the casino because it&#39;s it&#39;s an unsound uh place to allocate Capital Sophie have you looked at wind Resorts new UAE project seems like it would get a boost from the company um when is a China play we&#39;re playing it through Baba I think it&#39;s okay here I don&#39;t think you&#39;re going to get an easy double and we prefer doubles and triples that are pretty easy and pretty predictable with the risk being time and irr that doesn&#39;t really qualify um but it&#39;s a good company ### ASK_ME_ANYTHING_QA Greg says thanks for the analysis on diio I&#39;ve been working on opco what do you think I think it&#39;s a I think it&#39;s a garbage spec play that only has any credibility because Phil Frost has been dumping tons of money in it for years and years and years uh and Phil Frost started tea and he was an investor major investor at the first hedge fund that I worked at and he&#39;s a super smart guy and he&#39;s made a ton of money and this thing he&#39;s been bagged in for literally 16 17 years buying it up at 19 buying it down at a dollar so he obviously thinks it can work he&#39;s one of the smartest Minds in biotech so you have to gamble on if he is he going to be right in the next 18 days or is he going to be right in the next 18 years and I have no Edge on that which is why we own xbi and we&#39;ll take our simple over a few years and uh be Off to the Races but this thing tell me what your Edge is and I&#39;ll tell you whether you should be involved and uh uh for me there I have no Edge on that one Tim Ted do um this is one of the covid Darlings that&#39;s probably starting to show signs of Life everyone&#39;s copying it I don&#39;t really know what the mode is Amazon tried to get into the business everything&#39;s accelerating here ### ASK_ME_ANYTHING_QA um PD I mean this is probably one let&#39;s take a look financials income statement H who put this on quarterly that&#39;s why okay half of my numbers were off because this was switched to quarterly versus annual sorry about that um so revenues are decelerating never good on a Momo stock free cash flow is okay balance sheet 1.2 billion balance sheets okay just don&#39;t understand why they&#39;re losing so much uh what is the charge that let&#39;s see here $2 billion on 300 million of free cash flow with flat sales ### ASK_ME_ANYTHING_QA um look it&#39;s obviously more reasonably priced uh the key is are there any Catalyst for change ### ASK_ME_ANYTHING_QA um let me see what they&#39;re doing with the free cash flow are they buying in shares or are they issuing shares they keep issuing shares or giving shares to themselves I mean the share counts gone from 42 million to 168 million these this management is a bunch of pigs and uh I don&#39;t like that that&#39;s just a warning sign for me they they have no respect for Equity so I&#39;d look at it and just see what is the competition from other players in the market it might be cheap enough but any management that does this to the Share account I have zero respect for so I&#39;m not going to be involved with operators like that ### ASK_ME_ANYTHING_QA Philipe Andrew pinkos agricultural sector yeah I don&#39;t share all my positions so sorry about that ### ASK_ME_ANYTHING_QA Joseph cont top book recommendations to read for Joseph oberti uh tlick over tlick ### ASK_ME_ANYTHING_QA thanks Joseph start with the intelligent investor by Ben Graham read that if the light bulb doesn&#39;t go off go just go to a different career uh and make a lot of money doing something else uh it&#39;s just not for everyone ### ASK_ME_ANYTHING_QA if that does click read security analysis if that clicks start reading the CFA books if that clicks read every Buffet annual letter that you&#39;ve ever that he&#39;s ever published you can find them on Burkshire halfway. comom and then you can find his partnership letter on the internet margin of safety by Seth claran is is a worthwhile read ### ASK_ME_ANYTHING_QA um you can be a stock market genius by Joel green blad is a good read and that should keep you busy for three or four months and after that you can send back another question I&#39;ve read all that stuff what do you recommend next ### ASK_ME_ANYTHING_QA uh okay next is Mark Sher with the breath you expect outside the mag 7 people could play that with an equal weight or better with individual names are you aware of an exotic product that tracks to 493 I&#39;m not interested in exotic products that is a formula for cash incineration it exotic equals cash incinerator and it&#39;s your cash that&#39;s going to be incinerated sooner or later so stick stay away ### ASK_ME_ANYTHING_QA have you looked at Bath and Body Works uh I don&#39;t like this business yes I have we&#39;ve looked at it on the podcast it looks fine I don&#39;t want to be involved ### ASK_ME_ANYTHING_QA bath body works this is bbwi revenues have been dropping cash flow has been dropping pric has been going nowhere there are higher and better uses not not really interested ### ASK_ME_ANYTHING_QA namon want to pick your thoughts on tariffs regarding China Mexico and Canada ### ASK_ME_ANYTHING_QA aate loer we own uh um yeah they were the same fears in 2016 and um Cooper standard had their best year ever in 2017 so I wouldn&#39;t overthink that uh other than that let&#39;s see okay that&#39;s it for this week we&#39;ll be back next T next week uh the normal day on Thursday but new place from California in the meantime make it a great one\n\nthat&#39;s correct it&#39;s incorrect if you look study anything past a year history uh are Intel&#39;s problems too big to fix by Dan Gallagher in the Wall Street Journal sure Intel is strategic for the US and has defense contracts but it also needs to survive and thrive as a business so that was it he sent a period And I just replied back and I said is there a question or have you already made up your mind and he and he said I wanted to know if you changed your view so first off thank you for listening to our podcast second off thank you for sending a question third nothing&#39;s changed I I honestly don&#39;t think they had to fire gelsinger um but I think there&#39;s a possibility that because they did his planning his plan coming through under a different face will get the stock accelerated much faster than his plan coming through under his own face and I know that sounds silly but there&#39;s sentiment around him and there&#39;s so much failure baked around him with the pro problems that he inherited and couldn&#39;t turn the ship around fast enough that I think even if the ship turned around people wouldn&#39;t believe it uh whereas a new face like the guy I talked about who&#39;s got a huge track record of success when that 18a hits next year and the uh five nodes in four years plays out he&#39;ll get all the credit even though Ginger laid all the foundation and the market will believe it because they&#39;re not looking at all the money they lost under Ginger uh and the hatred they have for that they will be looking at new face new results New outcomes so it may improve prove our irr meaning it will take a lot less time any bit of good news with a new face will be believed and bought whereas any good news under Ginger people would say oh it&#39;s just a fake out this guy loses every time blah blah blah blah blah so uh I think it&#39;ll be a net positive in that regard CK says big fan of the Pod take a look at newor uh I don&#39;t like steel stocks no interest next Jason Z can you look at IM kta this is a special situation this takes a lot longer to look at than five minutes it&#39;s like a land holding m kta real estate company Moonlighting add a commercial Plaza lease operator and grocery stores throughout the Carolinas all right let&#39;s take a look here the balance sheet and see what kind of credit&#39;s given for this 3600 acres of land one half billion dollar 500 million at debt longterm uh let&#39;s see if they&#39;re generating any cash 100 million revenues are growing earnings are growing so I would like to find out what did they make some big acquisition or something to get this earnings jump um I mean there are two businesses I don&#39;t really like supermarket and these kind of like land plays that take 10 years to like St Joe&#39;s and Howard Hughes Corp it&#39;s just just takes forever to work out and it&#39;s just dead money and they hire better uses so I&#39;m going to pass on this one I like the creativity but it&#39;s not for me uh cork asked me to go speak to his students which I probably will in January in California JP would love to hear your thoughts on Pags I know we&#39;ve covered before take another look the new look is no um what&#39;s changed you&#39;re never going to know what Consumer loans are in that on that balance sheet you no way you&#39;re ever going to know so you can gamble on it the trade will probably work cash flow is turning negative price is priced for death um so then you got to do some solv analysis but you really don&#39;t know what you&#39;re holding because of all the off balance sheet Consumer Debt uh and credit receivables and there&#39;s no way you&#39;re going to get transparency on this and keep burning free cash so uh I have any cash 132 million I think it&#39;s I think it&#39;s like more than a coin flip bankruptcy and if it works it&#39;ll go to like 30 so you do asymmetry like that with like 1% 2% position if you lose you lose 2% of your portfolio if you if you win you make 4X so you make 8% total contribution I I just I don&#39;t want to play there ### ASK_ME_ANYTHING_QA Stone energy same story this is from uh Saar we&#39;ve covered this before and the answer was no wait Stone Co rather again negative cash flow you still have a bad government situation in in Brazil I mean if you have to take a bet on one of these two I would take it on Stone Co for sure this one might actually warrant some work so I just want to understand why the cash is getting burned and what&#39;s going to change about that anytime soon they have a decent enough balance sheet that they can withstand some I want to understand like what&#39;s the turnaround situation who is running it when it was at 95 who&#39;s running it now what&#39;s their plan to turn it around this one is probably worth doing some work work um I think Buffett owned it for a minute I don&#39;t think he owns anymore so I want to take a look at this if I want Brazilian exposure this one might be the one to look at but no high conviction there yet Martin schling from Vienna Austria schleig schn uh listening to you for a longer time now already well hopefully future investor uh do for my Austrian holding thank you very much for your insights made really nice profits over the last 18 months already good uh video cast is so much fun to listen in all right uh thank you comp you grab okay c m p u g r o u b got hit it hard ctm let&#39;s see comp you group there it is ealth Services worldwide ambulatory Information Systems impatient software again I mean it&#39;s very tough to tell if they have an actual mode of their business uh let&#39;s take a look it&#39;s been a lowquality business for a lot of years I don&#39;t see why that would change $80 million of cash8 they got 80 million of cash and 800 of long-term debt no bueno cash flow is positive free cash flow and what&#39;s happening with the revenues so they must have done a big acquisition here so it&#39;s a broken covid stock um a lot of these broken covid stocks are coming back like Etsy like PayPal like gener uh so there might be something here uh I think that okay so they named a new CEO in May he was chief officer at the German ealth company prior to the oh he was the CFO so they put the CFO in so you just have to understand his turnaround story and why their software has a an impenetrable Moe uh and that takes a lot more work than just looking at the financials um so first thing you want to start to study is who are their competitors and have they been gaining or losing share and try to understand the technology mod which is and I&#39;m not dismissing it this is it&#39;s a very hard exercise and this is why Buffett for so many years avoided software and technology companies um is because the barriers to entry are low and you just have to understand how the software works and why it can&#39;t be disrupted and that&#39;s a hard hard ask um if you can buy it with enough margin of safety that&#39;s a good thing it looks like this thing is turning so I like your your thought process but you really have to understand it otherwise you just put it in the too hard bin Matt tumau thoughts on Intel&#39;s new CEO the interim it&#39;s just a placeholder uh no thoughts uh we&#39;re not going to know anything for two months so don&#39;t expect miracles unless they panic and appoint the guy who I want from Cadence and they do it quickly um but boards never do that they don&#39;t get paid by the uh the hour miles Frasier really enjoying the podcast wanted to get your thoughts on two stocks JD and Dollar General uh Dollar General we&#39;ve been looking at for a while I think we would probably be more inclined to go with Dollar Tree we&#39;re not doing that because we have enough exposure with a similar low-end consumer cons retailer called Advanced Auto Parts which we like but if we didn&#39;t own Advanced Auto Parts we&#39;d probably take a very serious look at both of Dollar Tree and Dollar General I think they&#39;re going to recover uh and I think it&#39;s going to make time I love the fact that they&#39;re beat down over the Tariff fears because they&#39;re going to be worse than advertised uh better than advertised rather than less less bad uh njd I think that um uh JD JD&#39;s fine but I&#39;d rather play it through Baba because they&#39;ve got the cloud business so um leave it there uh next question comes from thanks miles Alex Ward uh trmd which is a shipper shipping companies are garbage um very cyclical we had a nice move on front line at one point I this is a tough business I mean honestly if you&#39;re gonna go into shipping you&#39;re best to buy the ships when there&#39;s a glut and wait for the cycle to tighten but um that&#39;s not what we do I&#39;ll take a quick look for you but it&#39;s a good way to lose a lot of money is buying shipper equities I remember all the people Lemmings chasing Zim shipping and it was going to go up forever and um it collapsed Fleet of product tankers in the UK see these land Banks

money is buying shipper equities I remember all the people Lemmings chasing Zim shipping and it was going to go up forever and um it collapsed Fleet of product tankers in the UK see these land Banks and shipping companies these are the things that people confuse as quality value investing versus deep value or special situations and this type of deep value stuff is what gives value investing a bad name because people get bagged in this stuff for 10 years and it never does anything um I generally wouldn&#39;t touch a shipper unless it&#39;s really like a like a 2009 bottom cycle and I&#39;m pretty confident that they&#39;re not going to go bankrupt I understand what you&#39;re seeing here I&#39;m just telling you that there ways to lose a lot of money shippers are are one miners are another this this does look like it&#39;s getting better but to your point you say that Howard marks is currently the main shareholder in selling large chunks of stock which are affecting the share price so he doesn&#39;t need to sell why is he selling what does he know that you don&#39;t know and I don&#39;t I generally don&#39;t want to be on the other side of a trade with Howard marks which is why it interests me that Howard marks is buying the hell out of China ### ASK_ME_ANYTHING_QA why d peer buying the hell out of China so uh higher and better uses I think your thinking framework Alex got you to a good place I just think you&#39;re in the wrong sector to play that game even if the stock price goes up it&#39;s like you&#39;re in a sector where the odds are against you to win from a historical standpoint you get lucky from time to time and make multi-baggers but uh you&#39;ll give it back to the casino because it&#39;s it&#39;s an unsound uh place to allocate Capital Sophie have you looked at wind Resorts new UAE project seems like it would get a boost from the company um when is a China play we&#39;re playing it through Baba I think it&#39;s okay here I don&#39;t think you&#39;re going to get an easy double and we prefer doubles and triples that are pretty easy and pretty predictable with the risk being time and irr that doesn&#39;t really qualify um but it&#39;s a good company ### ASK_ME_ANYTHING_QA Greg says thanks for the analysis on diio I&#39;ve been working on opco what do you think I think it&#39;s a I think it&#39;s a garbage spec play that only has any credibility because Phil Frost has been dumping tons of money in it for years and years and years uh and Phil Frost started tea and he was an investor major investor at the first hedge fund that I worked at and he&#39;s a super smart guy and he&#39;s made a ton of money and this thing he&#39;s been bagged in for literally 16 17 years buying it up at 19 buying it down at a dollar so he obviously thinks it can work he&#39;s one of the smartest Minds in biotech so you have to gamble on if he is he going to be right in the next 18 days or is he going to be right in the next 18 years and I have no Edge on that which is why we own xbi and we&#39;ll take our simple over a few years and uh be Off to the Races but this thing tell me what your Edge is and I&#39;ll tell you whether you should be involved and uh uh for me there I have no Edge on that one Tim Ted do um this is one of the covid Darlings that&#39;s probably starting to show signs of Life everyone&#39;s copying it I don&#39;t really know what the mode is Amazon tried to get into the business everything&#39;s accelerating here ### ASK_ME_ANYTHING_QA um PD I mean this is probably one let&#39;s take a look financials income statement H who put this on quarterly that&#39;s why okay half of my numbers were off because this was switched to quarterly versus annual sorry about that um so revenues are decelerating never good on a Momo stock free cash flow is okay balance sheet 1.2 billion balance sheets okay just don&#39;t understand why they&#39;re losing so much uh what is the charge that let&#39;s see here $2 billion on 300 million of free cash flow with flat sales ### ASK_ME_ANYTHING_QA um look it&#39;s obviously more reasonably priced uh the key is are there any Catalyst for change ### ASK_ME_ANYTHING_QA um let me see what they&#39;re doing with the free cash flow are they buying in shares or are they issuing shares they keep issuing shares or giving shares to themselves I mean the share counts gone from 42 million to 168 million these this management is a bunch of pigs and uh I don&#39;t like that that&#39;s just a warning sign for me they they have no respect for Equity so I&#39;d look at it and just see what is the competition from other players in the market it might be cheap enough but any management that does this to the Share account I have zero respect for so I&#39;m not going to be involved with operators like that ### ASK_ME_ANYTHING_QA Philipe Andrew pinkos agricultural sector yeah I don&#39;t share all my positions so sorry about that ### ASK_ME_ANYTHING_QA Joseph cont top book recommendations to read for Joseph oberti uh tlick over tlick ### ASK_ME_ANYTHING_QA thanks Joseph start with the intelligent investor by Ben Graham read that if the light bulb doesn&#39;t go off go just go to a different career uh and make a lot of money doing something else uh it&#39;s just not for everyone ### ASK_ME_ANYTHING_QA if that does click read security analysis if that clicks start reading the CFA books if that clicks read every Buffet annual letter that you&#39;ve ever that he&#39;s ever published you can find them on Burkshire halfway. comom and then you can find his partnership letter on the internet margin of safety by Seth claran is is a worthwhile read ### ASK_ME_ANYTHING_QA um you can be a stock market genius by Joel green blad is a good read and that should keep you busy for three or four months and after that you can send back another question I&#39;ve read all that stuff what do you recommend next ### ASK_ME_ANYTHING_QA uh okay next is Mark Sher with the breath you expect outside the mag 7 people could play that with an equal weight or better with individual names are you aware of an exotic product that tracks to 493 I&#39;m not interested in exotic products that is a formula for cash incineration it exotic equals cash incinerator and it&#39;s your cash that&#39;s going to be incinerated sooner or later so stick stay away ### ASK_ME_ANYTHING_QA have you looked at Bath and Body Works uh I don&#39;t like this business yes I have we&#39;ve looked at it on the podcast it looks fine I don&#39;t want to be involved ### ASK_ME_ANYTHING_QA bath body works this is bbwi revenues have been dropping cash flow has been dropping pric has been going nowhere there are higher and better uses not not really interested ### ASK_ME_ANYTHING_QA namon want to pick your thoughts on tariffs regarding China Mexico and Canada ### ASK_ME_ANYTHING_QA aate loer we own uh um yeah they were the same fears in 2016 and um Cooper standard had their best year ever in 2017 so I wouldn&#39;t overthink that uh other than that let&#39;s see okay that&#39;s it for this week we&#39;ll be back next T next week uh the normal day on Thursday but new place from California in the meantime make it a great one\n\nthat&#39;s correct it&#39;s incorrect if you look study anything past a year history uh are Intel&#39;s problems too big to fix by Dan Gallagher in the Wall Street Journal sure Intel is strategic for the US and has defense contracts but it also needs to survive and thrive as a business so that was it he sent a period And I just replied back and I said is there a question or have you already made up your mind and he and he said I wanted to know if you changed your view so first off thank you for listening to our podcast second off thank you for sending a question third nothing&#39;s changed I I honestly don&#39;t think they had to fire gelsinger um but I think there&#39;s a possibility that because they did his planning his plan coming through under a different face will get the stock accelerated much faster than his plan coming through under his own face and I know that sounds silly but there&#39;s sentiment around him and there&#39;s so much failure baked around him with the pro problems that he inherited and couldn&#39;t turn the ship around fast enough that I think even if the ship turned around people wouldn&#39;t believe it uh whereas a new face like the guy I talked about who&#39;s got a huge track record of success when that 18a hits next year and the uh five nodes in four years plays out he&#39;ll get all the credit even though Ginger laid all the foundation and the market will believe it because they&#39;re not looking at all the money they lost under Ginger uh and the hatred they have for that they will be looking at new face new results New outcomes so it may improve prove our irr meaning it will take a lot less time any bit of good news with a new face will be believed and bought whereas any good news under Ginger people would say oh it&#39;s just a fake out this guy loses every time blah blah blah blah blah so uh I think it&#39;ll be a net positive in that regard CK says big fan of the Pod take a look at newor uh I don&#39;t like steel stocks no interest next Jason Z can you look at IM kta this is a special situation this takes a lot longer to look at than five minutes it&#39;s like a land holding m kta real estate company Moonlighting add a commercial Plaza lease operator and grocery stores throughout the Carolinas all right let&#39;s take a look here the balance sheet and see what kind of credit&#39;s given for this 3600 acres of land one half billion dollar 500 million at debt longterm uh let&#39;s see if they&#39;re generating any cash 100 million revenues are growing earnings are growing so I would like to find out what did they make some big acquisition or something to get this earnings jump um I mean there are two businesses I don&#39;t really like supermarket and these kind of like land plays that take 10 years to like St Joe&#39;s and Howard Hughes Corp it&#39;s just just takes forever to work out and it&#39;s just dead money and they hire better uses so I&#39;m going to pass on this one I like the creativity but it&#39;s not for me uh cork asked me to go speak to his students which I probably will in January in California JP would love to hear your thoughts on Pags I know we&#39;ve covered before take another look the new look is no um what&#39;s changed you&#39;re never going to know what Consumer loans are in that on that balance sheet you no way you&#39;re ever going to know so you can gamble on it the trade will probably work cash flow is turning negative price is priced for death um so then you got to do some solv analysis but you really don&#39;t know what you&#39;re holding because of all the off balance sheet Consumer Debt uh and credit receivables and there&#39;s no way you&#39;re going to get transparency on this and keep burning free cash so uh I have any cash 132 million I think it&#39;s I think it&#39;s like more than a coin flip bankruptcy and if it works it&#39;ll go to like 30 so you do asymmetry like that with like 1% 2% position if you lose you lose 2% of your portfolio if you if you win you make 4X so you make 8% total contribution I I just I don&#39;t want to play there ### ASK_ME_ANYTHING_QA Stone energy same story this is from uh Saar we&#39;ve covered this before and the answer was no wait Stone Co rather again negative cash flow you still have a bad government situation in in Brazil I mean if you have to take a bet on one of these two I would take it on Stone Co for sure this one might actually warrant some work so I just want to understand why the cash is getting burned and what&#39;s going to change about that anytime soon they have a decent enough balance sheet that they can withstand some I want to understand like what&#39;s the turnaround situation who is running it when it was at 95 who&#39;s running it now what&#39;s their plan to turn it around this one is probably worth doing some work work um I think Buffett owned it for a minute I don&#39;t think he owns anymore so I want to take a look at this if I want Brazilian exposure this one might be the one to look at but no high conviction there yet Martin schling from Vienna Austria schleig schn uh listening to you for a longer time now already well hopefully future investor uh do for my Austrian holding thank you very much for your insights made really nice profits over the last 18 months already good uh video cast is so much fun to listen in all right uh thank you comp you grab okay c m p u g r o u b got hit it hard ctm let&#39;s see comp you group there it is ealth Services worldwide ambulatory Information Systems impatient software again I mean it&#39;s very tough to tell if they have an actual mode of their business uh let&#39;s take a look it&#39;s been a lowquality business for a lot of years I don&#39;t see why that would change $80 million of cash8 they got 80 million of cash and 800 of long-term debt no bueno cash flow is positive free cash flow and what&#39;s happening with the revenues so they must have done a big acquisition here so it&#39;s a broken covid stock um a lot of these broken covid stocks are coming back like Etsy like PayPal like gener uh so there might be something here uh I think that okay so they named a new CEO in May he was chief officer at the German ealth company prior to the oh he was the CFO so they put the CFO in so you just have to understand his turnaround story and why their software has a an impenetrable Moe uh and that takes a lot more work than just looking at the financials um so first thing you want to start to study is who are their competitors and have they been gaining or losing share and try to understand the technology mod which is and I&#39;m not dismissing it this is it&#39;s a very hard exercise and this is why Buffett for so many years avoided software and technology companies um is because the barriers to entry are low and you just have to understand how the software works and why it can&#39;t be disrupted and that&#39;s a hard hard ask um if you can buy it with enough margin of safety that&#39;s a good thing it looks like this thing is turning so I like your your thought process but you really have to understand it otherwise you just put it in the too hard bin Matt tumau thoughts on Intel&#39;s new CEO the interim it&#39;s just a placeholder uh no thoughts uh we&#39;re not going to know anything for two months so don&#39;t expect miracles unless they panic and appoint the guy who I want from Cadence and they do it quickly um but boards never do that they don&#39;t get paid by the uh the hour miles Frasier really enjoying the podcast wanted to get your thoughts on two stocks JD and Dollar General uh Dollar General we&#39;ve been looking at for a while I think we would probably be more inclined to go with Dollar Tree we&#39;re not doing that because we have enough exposure with a similar low-end consumer cons retailer called Advanced Auto Parts which we like but if we didn&#39;t own Advanced Auto Parts we&#39;d probably take a very serious look at both of Dollar Tree and Dollar General I think they&#39;re going to recover uh and I think it&#39;s going to make time I love the fact that they&#39;re beat down over the Tariff fears because they&#39;re going to be worse than advertised uh better than advertised rather than less less bad uh njd I think that um uh JD JD&#39;s fine but I&#39;d rather play it through Baba because they&#39;ve got the cloud business so um leave it there uh next question comes from thanks miles Alex Ward uh

trmd which is a shipper shipping companies are garbage um very cyclical we had a nice move on front line at one point I this is a tough business I mean honestly if you&#39;re gonna go into shipping you&#39;re best to buy the ships when there&#39;s a glut and wait for the cycle to tighten but um that&#39;s not what we do I&#39;ll take a quick look for you but it&#39;s a good way to lose a lot of money is buying shipper equities I remember all the people Lemmings chasing Zim shipping and it was going to go up forever and um it collapsed Fleet of product tankers in the UK see these land Banks and shipping companies these are the things that people confuse as quality value investing versus deep value or special situations and this type of deep value stuff is what gives value investing a bad name because people get bagged in this stuff for 10 years and it never does anything um I generally wouldn&#39;t touch a shipper unless it&#39;s really like a like a 2009 bottom cycle and I&#39;m pretty confident that they&#39;re not going to go bankrupt I understand what you&#39;re seeing here I&#39;m just telling you that there ways to lose a lot of money shippers are are one miners are another this this does look like it&#39;s getting better but to your point you say that Howard marks is currently the main shareholder in selling large chunks of stock which are affecting the share price so he doesn&#39;t need to sell why is he selling what does he know that you don&#39;t know and I don&#39;t I generally don&#39;t want to be on the other side of a trade with Howard marks which is why it interests me that Howard marks is buying the hell out of China ### ASK_ME_ANYTHING_QA why d peer buying the hell out of China so uh higher and better uses I think your thinking framework Alex got you to a good place I just think you&#39;re in the wrong sector to play that game even if the stock price goes up it&#39;s like you&#39;re in a sector where the odds are against you to win from a historical standpoint you get lucky from time to time and make multi-baggers but uh you&#39;ll give it back to the casino because it&#39;s it&#39;s an unsound uh place to allocate Capital Sophie have you looked at wind Resorts new UAE project seems like it would get a boost from the company um when is a China play we&#39;re playing it through Baba I think it&#39;s okay here I don&#39;t think you&#39;re going to get an easy double and we prefer doubles and triples that are pretty easy and pretty predictable with the risk being time and irr that doesn&#39;t really qualify um but it&#39;s a good company ### ASK_ME_ANYTHING_QA Greg says thanks for the analysis on diio I&#39;ve been working on opco what do you think I think it&#39;s a I think it&#39;s a garbage spec play that only has any credibility because Phil Frost has been dumping tons of money in it for years and years and years uh and Phil Frost started tea and he was an investor major investor at the first hedge fund that I worked at and he&#39;s a super smart guy and he&#39;s made a ton of money and this thing he&#39;s been bagged in for literally 16 17 years buying it up at 19 buying it down at a dollar so he obviously thinks it can work he&#39;s one of the smartest Minds in biotech so you have to gamble on if he is he going to be right in the next 18 days or is he going to be right in the next 18 years and I have no Edge on that which is why we own xbi and we&#39;ll take our simple over a few years and uh be Off to the Races but this thing tell me what your Edge is and I&#39;ll tell you whether you should be involved and uh uh for me there I have no Edge on that one Tim Ted do um this is one of the covid Darlings that&#39;s probably starting to show signs of Life everyone&#39;s copying it I don&#39;t really know what the mode is Amazon tried to get into the business everything&#39;s accelerating here ### ASK_ME_ANYTHING_QA um PD I mean this is probably one let&#39;s take a look financials income statement H who put this on quarterly that&#39;s why okay half of my numbers were off because this was switched to quarterly versus annual sorry about that um so revenues are decelerating never good on a Momo stock free cash flow is okay balance sheet 1.2 billion balance sheets okay just don&#39;t understand why they&#39;re losing so much uh what is the charge that let&#39;s see here $2 billion on 300 million of free cash flow with flat sales ### ASK_ME_ANYTHING_QA um look it&#39;s obviously more reasonably priced uh the key is are there any Catalyst for change ### ASK_ME_ANYTHING_QA um let me see what they&#39;re doing with the free cash flow are they buying in shares or are they issuing shares they keep issuing shares or giving shares to themselves I mean the share counts gone from 42 million to 168 million these this management is a bunch of pigs and uh I don&#39;t like that that&#39;s just a warning sign for me they they have no respect for Equity so I&#39;d look at it and just see what is the competition from other players in the market it might be cheap enough but any management that does this to the Share account I have zero respect for so I&#39;m not going to be involved with operators like that ### ASK_ME_ANYTHING_QA Philipe Andrew pinkos agricultural sector yeah I don&#39;t share all my positions so sorry about that ### ASK_ME_ANYTHING_QA Joseph cont top book recommendations to read for Joseph oberti uh tlick over tlick ### ASK_ME_ANYTHING_QA thanks Joseph start with the intelligent investor by Ben Graham read that if the light bulb doesn&#39;t go off go just go to a different career uh and make a lot of money doing something else uh it&#39;s just not for everyone ### ASK_ME_ANYTHING_QA if that does click read security analysis if that clicks start reading the CFA books if that clicks read every Buffet annual letter that you&#39;ve ever that he&#39;s ever published you can find them on Burkshire halfway. comom and then you can find his partnership letter on the internet margin of safety by Seth claran is is a worthwhile read ### ASK_ME_ANYTHING_QA um you can be a stock market genius by Joel green blad is a good read and that should keep you busy for three or four months and after that you can send back another question I&#39;ve read all that stuff what do you recommend next ### ASK_ME_ANYTHING_QA uh okay next is Mark Sher with the breath you expect outside the mag 7 people could play that with an equal weight or better with individual names are you aware of an exotic product that tracks to 493 I&#39;m not interested in exotic products that is a formula for cash incineration it exotic equals cash incinerator and it&#39;s your cash that&#39;s going to be incinerated sooner or later so stick stay away ### ASK_ME_ANYTHING_QA have you looked at Bath and Body Works uh I don&#39;t like this business yes I have we&#39;ve looked at it on the podcast it looks fine I don&#39;t want to be involved ### ASK_ME_ANYTHING_QA bath body works this is bbwi revenues have been dropping cash flow has been dropping pric has been going nowhere there are higher and better uses not not really interested ### ASK_ME_ANYTHING_QA namon want to pick your thoughts on tariffs regarding China Mexico and Canada ### ASK_ME_ANYTHING_QA aate loer we own uh um yeah they were the same fears in 2016 and um Cooper standard had their best year ever in 2017 so I wouldn&#39;t overthink that uh other than that let&#39;s see okay that&#39;s it for this week we&#39;ll be back next T next week uh the normal day on Thursday but new place from California in the meantime make it a great one\n\nthat&#39;s correct it&#39;s incorrect if you look study anything past a year history uh are Intel&#39;s problems too big to fix by Dan Gallagher in the Wall Street Journal sure Intel is strategic for the US and has defense contracts but it also needs to survive and thrive as a business so that was it he sent a period And I just replied back and I said is there a question or have you already made up your mind and he and he said I wanted to know if you changed your view so first off thank you for listening to our podcast second off thank you for sending a question third nothing&#39;s changed I I honestly don&#39;t think they had to fire gelsinger um but I think there&#39;s a possibility that because they did his planning his plan coming through under a different face will get the stock accelerated much faster than his plan coming through under his own face and I know that sounds silly but there&#39;s sentiment around him and there&#39;s so much failure baked around him with the pro problems that he inherited and couldn&#39;t turn the ship around fast enough that I think even if the ship turned around people wouldn&#39;t believe it uh whereas a new face like the guy I talked about who&#39;s got a huge track record of success when that 18a hits next year and the uh five nodes in four years plays out he&#39;ll get all the credit even though Ginger laid all the foundation and the market will believe it because they&#39;re not looking at all the money they lost under Ginger uh and the hatred they have for that they will be looking at new face new results New outcomes so it may improve prove our irr meaning it will take a lot less time any bit of good news with a new face will be believed and bought whereas any good news under Ginger people would say oh it&#39;s just a fake out this guy loses every time blah blah blah blah blah so uh I think it&#39;ll be a net positive in that regard CK says big fan of the Pod take a look at newor uh I don&#39;t like steel stocks no interest next Jason Z can you look at IM kta this is a special situation this takes a lot longer to look at than five minutes it&#39;s like a land holding m kta real estate company Moonlighting add a commercial Plaza lease operator and grocery stores throughout the Carolinas all right let&#39;s take a look here the balance sheet and see what kind of credit&#39;s given for this 3600 acres of land one half billion dollar 500 million at debt longterm uh let&#39;s see if they&#39;re generating any cash 100 million revenues are growing earnings are growing so I would like to find out what did they make some big acquisition or something to get this earnings jump um I mean there are two businesses I don&#39;t really like supermarket and these kind of like land plays that take 10 years to like St Joe&#39;s and Howard Hughes Corp it&#39;s just just takes forever to work out and it&#39;s just dead money and they hire better uses so I&#39;m going to pass on this one I like the creativity but it&#39;s not for me uh cork asked me to go speak to his students which I probably will in January in California JP would love to hear your thoughts on Pags I know we&#39;ve covered before take another look the new look is no um what&#39;s changed you&#39;re never going to know what Consumer loans are in that on that balance sheet you no way you&#39;re ever going to know so you can gamble on it the trade will probably work cash flow is turning negative price is priced for death um so then you got to do some solv analysis but you really don&#39;t know what you&#39;re holding because of all the off balance sheet Consumer Debt uh and credit receivables and there&#39;s no way you&#39;re going to get transparency on this and keep burning free cash so uh I have any cash 132 million I think it&#39;s I think it&#39;s like more than a coin flip bankruptcy and if it works it&#39;ll go to like 30 so you do asymmetry like that with like 1% 2% position if you lose you lose 2% of your portfolio if you if you win you make 4X so you make 8% total contribution I I just I don&#39;t want to play there ### ASK_ME_ANYTHING_QA Stone energy same story this is from uh Saar we&#39;ve covered this before and the answer was no wait Stone Co rather again negative cash flow you still have a bad government situation in in Brazil I mean if you have to take a bet on one of these two I would take it on Stone Co for sure this one might actually warrant some work so I just want to understand why the cash is getting burned and what&#39;s going to change about that anytime soon they have a decent enough balance sheet that they can withstand some I want to understand like what&#39;s the turnaround situation who is running it when it was at 95 who&#39;s running it now what&#39;s their plan to turn it around this one is probably worth doing some work work um I think Buffett owned it for a minute I don&#39;t think he owns anymore so I want to take a look at this if I want Brazilian exposure this one might be the one to look at but no high conviction there yet Martin schling from Vienna Austria schleig schn uh listening to you for a longer time now already well hopefully future investor uh do for my Austrian holding thank you very much for your insights made really nice profits over the last 18 months already good uh video cast is so much fun to listen in all right uh thank you comp you grab okay c m p u g r o u b got hit it hard ctm let&#39;s see comp you group there it is ealth Services worldwide ambulatory Information Systems impatient software again I mean it&#39;s very tough to tell if they have an actual mode of their business uh let&#39;s take a look it&#39;s been a lowquality business for a lot of years I don&#39;t see why that would change $80 million of cash8 they got 80 million of cash and 800 of long-term debt no bueno cash flow is positive free cash flow and what&#39;s happening with the revenues so they must have done a big acquisition here so it&#39;s a broken covid stock um a lot of these broken covid stocks are coming back like Etsy like PayPal like gener uh so there might be something here uh I think that okay so they named a new CEO in May he was chief officer at the German ealth company prior to the oh he was the CFO so they put the CFO in so you just have to understand his turnaround story and why their software has a an impenetrable Moe uh and that takes a lot more work than just looking at the financials um so first thing you want to start to study is who are their competitors and have they been gaining or losing share and try to understand the technology mod which is and I&#39;m not dismissing it this is it&#39;s a very hard exercise and this is why Buffett for so many years avoided software and technology companies um is because the barriers to entry are low and you just have to understand how the software works and why it can&#39;t be disrupted and that&#39;s a hard hard ask um if you can buy it with enough margin of safety that&#39;s a good thing it looks like this thing is turning so I like your your thought process but you really have to understand it otherwise you just put it in the too hard bin Matt tumau thoughts on Intel&#39;s new CEO the interim it&#39;s just a placeholder uh no thoughts uh we&#39;re not going to know anything for two months so don&#39;t expect miracles unless they panic and appoint the guy who I want from Cadence and they do it quickly um but boards never do that they don&#39;t get paid by the uh the hour miles Frasier really enjoying the podcast wanted to get your thoughts on two stocks JD and Dollar General uh Dollar General we&#39;ve been looking at for a while I think we would probably be more inclined to go with Dollar Tree we&#39;re not doing that because we have enough exposure with a similar low-end consumer cons retailer called Advanced Auto Parts which we like but if we didn&#39;t own Advanced Auto Parts we&#39;d probably take a very serious look at both of Dollar Tree and Dollar General I think they&#39;re going to recover uh and I think it&#39;s going to make time I love the fact that they&#39;re beat down over the Tariff fears because they&#39;re going to be worse than advertised uh better than advertised rather than less less bad

it&#39;s going to make time I love the fact that they&#39;re beat down over the Tariff fears because they&#39;re going to be worse than advertised uh better than advertised rather than less less bad uh njd I think that um uh JD JD&#39;s fine but I&#39;d rather play it through Baba because they&#39;ve got the cloud business so um leave it there uh next question comes from thanks miles Alex Ward uh trmd which is a shipper shipping companies are garbage um very cyclical we had a nice move on front line at one point I this is a tough business I mean honestly if you&#39;re gonna go into shipping you&#39;re best to buy the ships when there&#39;s a glut and wait for the cycle to tighten but um that&#39;s not what we do I&#39;ll take a quick look for you but it&#39;s a good way to lose a lot of money is buying shipper equities I remember all the people Lemmings chasing Zim shipping and it was going to go up forever and um it collapsed Fleet of product tankers in the UK see these land Banks and shipping companies these are the things that people confuse as quality value investing versus deep value or special situations and this type of deep value stuff is what gives value investing a bad name because people get bagged in this stuff for 10 years and it never does anything um I generally wouldn&#39;t touch a shipper unless it&#39;s really like a like a 2009 bottom cycle and I&#39;m pretty confident that they&#39;re not going to go bankrupt I understand what you&#39;re seeing here I&#39;m just telling you that there ways to lose a lot of money shippers are are one miners are another this this does look like it&#39;s getting better but to your point you say that Howard marks is currently the main shareholder in selling large chunks of stock which are affecting the share price so he doesn&#39;t need to sell why is he selling what does he know that you don&#39;t know and I don&#39;t I generally don&#39;t want to be on the other side of a trade with Howard marks which is why it interests me that Howard marks is buying the hell out of China ### ASK_ME_ANYTHING_QA why d peer buying the hell out of China so uh higher and better uses I think your thinking framework Alex got you to a good place I just think you&#39;re in the wrong sector to play that game even if the stock price goes up it&#39;s like you&#39;re in a sector where the odds are against you to win from a historical standpoint you get lucky from time to time and make multi-baggers but uh you&#39;ll give it back to the casino because it&#39;s it&#39;s an unsound uh place to allocate Capital Sophie have you looked at wind Resorts new UAE project seems like it would get a boost from the company um when is a China play we&#39;re playing it through Baba I think it&#39;s okay here I don&#39;t think you&#39;re going to get an easy double and we prefer doubles and triples that are pretty easy and pretty predictable with the risk being time and irr that doesn&#39;t really qualify um but it&#39;s a good company ### ASK_ME_ANYTHING_QA Greg says thanks for the analysis on diio I&#39;ve been working on opco what do you think I think it&#39;s a I think it&#39;s a garbage spec play that only has any credibility because Phil Frost has been dumping tons of money in it for years and years and years uh and Phil Frost started tea and he was an investor major investor at the first hedge fund that I worked at and he&#39;s a super smart guy and he&#39;s made a ton of money and this thing he&#39;s been bagged in for literally 16 17 years buying it up at 19 buying it down at a dollar so he obviously thinks it can work he&#39;s one of the smartest Minds in biotech so you have to gamble on if he is he going to be right in the next 18 days or is he going to be right in the next 18 years and I have no Edge on that which is why we own xbi and we&#39;ll take our simple over a few years and uh be Off to the Races but this thing tell me what your Edge is and I&#39;ll tell you whether you should be involved and uh uh for me there I have no Edge on that one Tim Ted do um this is one of the covid Darlings that&#39;s probably starting to show signs of Life everyone&#39;s copying it I don&#39;t really know what the mode is Amazon tried to get into the business everything&#39;s accelerating here ### ASK_ME_ANYTHING_QA um PD I mean this is probably one let&#39;s take a look financials income statement H who put this on quarterly that&#39;s why okay half of my numbers were off because this was switched to quarterly versus annual sorry about that um so revenues are decelerating never good on a Momo stock free cash flow is okay balance sheet 1.2 billion balance sheets okay just don&#39;t understand why they&#39;re losing so much uh what is the charge that let&#39;s see here $2 billion on 300 million of free cash flow with flat sales ### ASK_ME_ANYTHING_QA um look it&#39;s obviously more reasonably priced uh the key is are there any Catalyst for change ### ASK_ME_ANYTHING_QA um let me see what they&#39;re doing with the free cash flow are they buying in shares or are they issuing shares they keep issuing shares or giving shares to themselves I mean the share counts gone from 42 million to 168 million these this management is a bunch of pigs and uh I don&#39;t like that that&#39;s just a warning sign for me they they have no respect for Equity so I&#39;d look at it and just see what is the competition from other players in the market it might be cheap enough but any management that does this to the Share account I have zero respect for so I&#39;m not going to be involved with operators like that ### ASK_ME_ANYTHING_QA Philipe Andrew pinkos agricultural sector yeah I don&#39;t share all my positions so sorry about that ### ASK_ME_ANYTHING_QA Joseph cont top book recommendations to read for Joseph oberti uh tlick over tlick ### ASK_ME_ANYTHING_QA thanks Joseph start with the intelligent investor by Ben Graham read that if the light bulb doesn&#39;t go off go just go to a different career uh and make a lot of money doing something else uh it&#39;s just not for everyone ### ASK_ME_ANYTHING_QA if that does click read security analysis if that clicks start reading the CFA books if that clicks read every Buffet annual letter that you&#39;ve ever that he&#39;s ever published you can find them on Burkshire halfway. comom and then you can find his partnership letter on the internet margin of safety by Seth claran is is a worthwhile read ### ASK_ME_ANYTHING_QA um you can be a stock market genius by Joel green blad is a good read and that should keep you busy for three or four months and after that you can send back another question I&#39;ve read all that stuff what do you recommend next ### ASK_ME_ANYTHING_QA uh okay next is Mark Sher with the breath you expect outside the mag 7 people could play that with an equal weight or better with individual names are you aware of an exotic product that tracks to 493 I&#39;m not interested in exotic products that is a formula for cash incineration it exotic equals cash incinerator and it&#39;s your cash that&#39;s going to be incinerated sooner or later so stick stay away ### ASK_ME_ANYTHING_QA have you looked at Bath and Body Works uh I don&#39;t like this business yes I have we&#39;ve looked at it on the podcast it looks fine I don&#39;t want to be involved ### ASK_ME_ANYTHING_QA bath body works this is bbwi revenues have been dropping cash flow has been dropping pric has been going nowhere there are higher and better uses not not really interested ### ASK_ME_ANYTHING_QA namon want to pick your thoughts on tariffs regarding China Mexico and Canada ### ASK_ME_ANYTHING_QA aate loer we own uh um yeah they were the same fears in 2016 and um Cooper standard had their best year ever in 2017 so I wouldn&#39;t overthink that uh other than that let&#39;s see okay that&#39;s it for this week we&#39;ll be back next T next week uh the normal day on Thursday but new place from California in the meantime make it a great one\n\nthat&#39;s correct it&#39;s incorrect if you look study anything past a year history uh are Intel&#39;s problems too big to fix by Dan Gallagher in the Wall Street Journal sure Intel is strategic for the US and has defense contracts but it also needs to survive and thrive as a business so that was it he sent a period And I just replied back and I said is there a question or have you already made up your mind and he and he said I wanted to know if you changed your view so first off thank you for listening to our podcast second off thank you for sending a question third nothing&#39;s changed I I honestly don&#39;t think they had to fire gelsinger um but I think there&#39;s a possibility that because they did his planning his plan coming through under a different face will get the stock accelerated much faster than his plan coming through under his own face and I know that sounds silly but there&#39;s sentiment around him and there&#39;s so much failure baked around him with the pro problems that he inherited and couldn&#39;t turn the ship around fast enough that I think even if the ship turned around people wouldn&#39;t believe it uh whereas a new face like the guy I talked about who&#39;s got a huge track record of success when that 18a hits next year and the uh five nodes in four years plays out he&#39;ll get all the credit even though Ginger laid all the foundation and the market will believe it because they&#39;re not looking at all the money they lost under Ginger uh and the hatred they have for that they will be looking at new face new results New outcomes so it may improve prove our irr meaning it will take a lot less time any bit of good news with a new face will be believed and bought whereas any good news under Ginger people would say oh it&#39;s just a fake out this guy loses every time blah blah blah blah blah so uh I think it&#39;ll be a net positive in that regard CK says big fan of the Pod take a look at newor uh I don&#39;t like steel stocks no interest next Jason Z can you look at IM kta this is a special situation this takes a lot longer to look at than five minutes it&#39;s like a land holding m kta real estate company Moonlighting add a commercial Plaza lease operator and grocery stores throughout the Carolinas all right let&#39;s take a look here the balance sheet and see what kind of credit&#39;s given for this 3600 acres of land one half billion dollar 500 million at debt longterm uh let&#39;s see if they&#39;re generating any cash 100 million revenues are growing earnings are growing so I would like to find out what did they make some big acquisition or something to get this earnings jump um I mean there are two businesses I don&#39;t really like supermarket and these kind of like land plays that take 10 years to like St Joe&#39;s and Howard Hughes Corp it&#39;s just just takes forever to work out and it&#39;s just dead money and they hire better uses so I&#39;m going to pass on this one I like the creativity but it&#39;s not for me uh cork asked me to go speak to his students which I probably will in January in California JP would love to hear your thoughts on Pags I know we&#39;ve covered before take another look the new look is no um what&#39;s changed you&#39;re never going to know what Consumer loans are in that on that balance sheet you no way you&#39;re ever going to know so you can gamble on it the trade will probably work cash flow is turning negative price is priced for death um so then you got to do some solv analysis but you really don&#39;t know what you&#39;re holding because of all the off balance sheet Consumer Debt uh and credit receivables and there&#39;s no way you&#39;re going to get transparency on this and keep burning free cash so uh I have any cash 132 million I think it&#39;s I think it&#39;s like more than a coin flip bankruptcy and if it works it&#39;ll go to like 30 so you do asymmetry like that with like 1% 2% position if you lose you lose 2% of your portfolio if you if you win you make 4X so you make 8% total contribution I I just I don&#39;t want to play there ### ASK_ME_ANYTHING_QA Stone energy same story this is from uh Saar we&#39;ve covered this before and the answer was no wait Stone Co rather again negative cash flow you still have a bad government situation in in Brazil I mean if you have to take a bet on one of these two I would take it on Stone Co for sure this one might actually warrant some work so I just want to understand why the cash is getting burned and what&#39;s going to change about that anytime soon they have a decent enough balance sheet that they can withstand some I want to understand like what&#39;s the turnaround situation who is running it when it was at 95 who&#39;s running it now what&#39;s their plan to turn it around this one is probably worth doing some work work um I think Buffett owned it for a minute I don&#39;t think he owns anymore so I want to take a look at this if I want Brazilian exposure this one might be the one to look at but no high conviction there yet Martin schling from Vienna Austria schleig schn uh listening to you for a longer time now already well hopefully future investor uh do for my Austrian holding thank you very much for your insights made really nice profits over the last 18 months already good uh video cast is so much fun to listen in all right uh thank you comp you grab okay c m p u g r o u b got hit it hard ctm let&#39;s see comp you group there it is ealth Services worldwide ambulatory Information Systems impatient software again I mean it&#39;s very tough to tell if they have an actual mode of their business uh let&#39;s take a look it&#39;s been a lowquality business for a lot of years I don&#39;t see why that would change $80 million of cash8 they got 80 million of cash and 800 of long-term debt no bueno cash flow is positive free cash flow and what&#39;s happening with the revenues so they must have done a big acquisition here so it&#39;s a broken covid stock um a lot of these broken covid stocks are coming back like Etsy like PayPal like gener uh so there might be something here uh I think that okay so they named a new CEO in May he was chief officer at the German ealth company prior to the oh he was the CFO so they put the CFO in so you just have to understand his turnaround story and why their software has a an impenetrable Moe uh and that takes a lot more work than just looking at the financials um so first thing you want to start to study is who are their competitors and have they been gaining or losing share and try to understand the technology mod which is and I&#39;m not dismissing it this is it&#39;s a very hard exercise and this is why Buffett for so many years avoided software and technology companies um is because the barriers to entry are low and you just have to understand how the software works and why it can&#39;t be disrupted and that&#39;s a hard hard ask um if you can buy it with enough margin of safety that&#39;s a good thing it looks like this thing is turning so I like your your thought process but you really have to understand it otherwise you just put it in the too hard bin Matt tumau thoughts on Intel&#39;s new CEO the interim it&#39;s just a placeholder uh no thoughts uh we&#39;re not going to know anything for two months so don&#39;t expect miracles unless they panic and appoint the guy who I want from Cadence and they do it quickly um but boards never do that they don&#39;t get paid by the uh the hour miles Frasier really enjoying the podcast wanted to get your thoughts on two stocks JD and Dollar General uh Dollar General we&#39;ve been looking at for a while

I think we would probably be more inclined to go with Dollar Tree we&#39;re not doing that because we have enough exposure with a similar low-end consumer cons retailer called Advanced Auto Parts which we like but if we didn&#39;t own Advanced Auto Parts we&#39;d probably take a very serious look at both of Dollar Tree and Dollar General I think they&#39;re going to recover uh and I think it&#39;s going to make time I love the fact that they&#39;re beat down over the Tariff fears because they&#39;re going to be worse than advertised uh better than advertised rather than less less bad uh njd I think that um uh JD JD&#39;s fine but I&#39;d rather play it through Baba because they&#39;ve got the cloud business so um leave it there uh next question comes from thanks miles Alex Ward uh trmd which is a shipper shipping companies are garbage um very cyclical we had a nice move on front line at one point I this is a tough business I mean honestly if you&#39;re gonna go into shipping you&#39;re best to buy the ships when there&#39;s a glut and wait for the cycle to tighten but um that&#39;s not what we do I&#39;ll take a quick look for you but it&#39;s a good way to lose a lot of money is buying shipper equities I remember all the people Lemmings chasing Zim shipping and it was going to go up forever and um it collapsed Fleet of product tankers in the UK see these land Banks and shipping companies these are the things that people confuse as quality value investing versus deep value or special situations and this type of deep value stuff is what gives value investing a bad name because people get bagged in this stuff for 10 years and it never does anything um I generally wouldn&#39;t touch a shipper unless it&#39;s really like a like a 2009 bottom cycle and I&#39;m pretty confident that they&#39;re not going to go bankrupt I understand what you&#39;re seeing here I&#39;m just telling you that there ways to lose a lot of money shippers are are one miners are another this this does look like it&#39;s getting better but to your point you say that Howard marks is currently the main shareholder in selling large chunks of stock which are affecting the share price so he doesn&#39;t need to sell why is he selling what does he know that you don&#39;t know and I don&#39;t I generally don&#39;t want to be on the other side of a trade with Howard marks which is why it interests me that Howard marks is buying the hell out of China ### ASK_ME_ANYTHING_QA why d peer buying the hell out of China so uh higher and better uses I think your thinking framework Alex got you to a good place I just think you&#39;re in the wrong sector to play that game even if the stock price goes up it&#39;s like you&#39;re in a sector where the odds are against you to win from a historical standpoint you get lucky from time to time and make multi-baggers but uh you&#39;ll give it back to the casino because it&#39;s it&#39;s an unsound uh place to allocate Capital Sophie have you looked at wind Resorts new UAE project seems like it would get a boost from the company um when is a China play we&#39;re playing it through Baba I think it&#39;s okay here I don&#39;t think you&#39;re going to get an easy double and we prefer doubles and triples that are pretty easy and pretty predictable with the risk being time and irr that doesn&#39;t really qualify um but it&#39;s a good company ### ASK_ME_ANYTHING_QA Greg says thanks for the analysis on diio I&#39;ve been working on opco what do you think I think it&#39;s a I think it&#39;s a garbage spec play that only has any credibility because Phil Frost has been dumping tons of money in it for years and years and years uh and Phil Frost started tea and he was an investor major investor at the first hedge fund that I worked at and he&#39;s a super smart guy and he&#39;s made a ton of money and this thing he&#39;s been bagged in for literally 16 17 years buying it up at 19 buying it down at a dollar so he obviously thinks it can work he&#39;s one of the smartest Minds in biotech so you have to gamble on if he is he going to be right in the next 18 days or is he going to be right in the next 18 years and I have no Edge on that which is why we own xbi and we&#39;ll take our simple over a few years and uh be Off to the Races but this thing tell me what your Edge is and I&#39;ll tell you whether you should be involved and uh uh for me there I have no Edge on that one Tim Ted do um this is one of the covid Darlings that&#39;s probably starting to show signs of Life everyone&#39;s copying it I don&#39;t really know what the mode is Amazon tried to get into the business everything&#39;s accelerating here ### ASK_ME_ANYTHING_QA um PD I mean this is probably one let&#39;s take a look financials income statement H who put this on quarterly that&#39;s why okay half of my numbers were off because this was switched to quarterly versus annual sorry about that um so revenues are decelerating never good on a Momo stock free cash flow is okay balance sheet 1.2 billion balance sheets okay just don&#39;t understand why they&#39;re losing so much uh what is the charge that let&#39;s see here $2 billion on 300 million of free cash flow with flat sales ### ASK_ME_ANYTHING_QA um look it&#39;s obviously more reasonably priced uh the key is are there any Catalyst for change ### ASK_ME_ANYTHING_QA um let me see what they&#39;re doing with the free cash flow are they buying in shares or are they issuing shares they keep issuing shares or giving shares to themselves I mean the share counts gone from 42 million to 168 million these this management is a bunch of pigs and uh I don&#39;t like that that&#39;s just a warning sign for me they they have no respect for Equity so I&#39;d look at it and just see what is the competition from other players in the market it might be cheap enough but any management that does this to the Share account I have zero respect for so I&#39;m not going to be involved with operators like that ### ASK_ME_ANYTHING_QA Philipe Andrew pinkos agricultural sector yeah I don&#39;t share all my positions so sorry about that ### ASK_ME_ANYTHING_QA Joseph cont top book recommendations to read for Joseph oberti uh tlick over tlick ### ASK_ME_ANYTHING_QA thanks Joseph start with the intelligent investor by Ben Graham read that if the light bulb doesn&#39;t go off go just go to a different career uh and make a lot of money doing something else uh it&#39;s just not for everyone ### ASK_ME_ANYTHING_QA if that does click read security analysis if that clicks start reading the CFA books if that clicks read every Buffet annual letter that you&#39;ve ever that he&#39;s ever published you can find them on Burkshire halfway. comom and then you can find his partnership letter on the internet margin of safety by Seth claran is is a worthwhile read ### ASK_ME_ANYTHING_QA um you can be a stock market genius by Joel green blad is a good read and that should keep you busy for three or four months and after that you can send back another question I&#39;ve read all that stuff what do you recommend next ### ASK_ME_ANYTHING_QA uh okay next is Mark Sher with the breath you expect outside the mag 7 people could play that with an equal weight or better with individual names are you aware of an exotic product that tracks to 493 I&#39;m not interested in exotic products that is a formula for cash incineration it exotic equals cash incinerator and it&#39;s your cash that&#39;s going to be incinerated sooner or later so stick stay away ### ASK_ME_ANYTHING_QA have you looked at Bath and Body Works uh I don&#39;t like this business yes I have we&#39;ve looked at it on the podcast it looks fine I don&#39;t want to be involved ### ASK_ME_ANYTHING_QA bath body works this is bbwi revenues have been dropping cash flow has been dropping pric has been going nowhere there are higher and better uses not not really interested ### ASK_ME_ANYTHING_QA namon want to pick your thoughts on tariffs regarding China Mexico and Canada ### ASK_ME_ANYTHING_QA aate loer we own uh um yeah they were the same fears in 2016 and um Cooper standard had their best year ever in 2017 so I wouldn&#39;t overthink that uh other than that let&#39;s see okay that&#39;s it for this week we&#39;ll be back next T next week uh the normal day on Thursday but new place from California in the meantime make it a great one\n\nthat&#39;s correct it&#39;s incorrect if you look study anything past a year history uh are Intel&#39;s problems too big to fix by Dan Gallagher in the Wall Street Journal sure Intel is strategic for the US and has defense contracts but it also needs to survive and thrive as a business so that was it he sent a period And I just replied back and I said is there a question or have you already made up your mind and he and he said I wanted to know if you changed your view so first off thank you for listening to our podcast second off thank you for sending a question third nothing&#39;s changed I I honestly don&#39;t think they had to fire gelsinger um but I think there&#39;s a possibility that because they did his planning his plan coming through under a different face will get the stock accelerated much faster than his plan coming through under his own face and I know that sounds silly but there&#39;s sentiment around him and there&#39;s so much failure baked around him with the pro problems that he inherited and couldn&#39;t turn the ship around fast enough that I think even if the ship turned around people wouldn&#39;t believe it uh whereas a new face like the guy I talked about who&#39;s got a huge track record of success when that 18a hits next year and the uh five nodes in four years plays out he&#39;ll get all the credit even though Ginger laid all the foundation and the market will believe it because they&#39;re not looking at all the money they lost under Ginger uh and the hatred they have for that they will be looking at new face new results New outcomes so it may improve prove our irr meaning it will take a lot less time any bit of good news with a new face will be believed and bought whereas any good news under Ginger people would say oh it&#39;s just a fake out this guy loses every time blah blah blah blah blah so uh I think it&#39;ll be a net positive in that regard CK says big fan of the Pod take a look at newor uh I don&#39;t like steel stocks no interest next Jason Z can you look at IM kta this is a special situation this takes a lot longer to look at than five minutes it&#39;s like a land holding m kta real estate company Moonlighting add a commercial Plaza lease operator and grocery stores throughout the Carolinas all right let&#39;s take a look here the balance sheet and see what kind of credit&#39;s given for this 3600 acres of land one half billion dollar 500 million at debt longterm uh let&#39;s see if they&#39;re generating any cash 100 million revenues are growing earnings are growing so I would like to find out what did they make some big acquisition or something to get this earnings jump um I mean there are two businesses I don&#39;t really like supermarket and these kind of like land plays that take 10 years to like St Joe&#39;s and Howard Hughes Corp it&#39;s just just takes forever to work out and it&#39;s just dead money and they hire better uses so I&#39;m going to pass on this one I like the creativity but it&#39;s not for me uh cork asked me to go speak to his students which I probably will in January in California JP would love to hear your thoughts on Pags I know we&#39;ve covered before take another look the new look is no um what&#39;s changed you&#39;re never going to know what Consumer loans are in that on that balance sheet you no way you&#39;re ever going to know so you can gamble on it the trade will probably work cash flow is turning negative price is priced for death um so then you got to do some solv analysis but you really don&#39;t know what you&#39;re holding because of all the off balance sheet Consumer Debt uh and credit receivables and there&#39;s no way you&#39;re going to get transparency on this and keep burning free cash so uh I have any cash 132 million I think it&#39;s I think it&#39;s like more than a coin flip bankruptcy and if it works it&#39;ll go to like 30 so you do asymmetry like that with like 1% 2% position if you lose you lose 2% of your portfolio if you if you win you make 4X so you make 8% total contribution I I just I don&#39;t want to play there ### ASK_ME_ANYTHING_QA Stone energy same story this is from uh Saar we&#39;ve covered this before and the answer was no wait Stone Co rather again negative cash flow you still have a bad government situation in in Brazil I mean if you have to take a bet on one of these two I would take it on Stone Co for sure this one might actually warrant some work so I just want to understand why the cash is getting burned and what&#39;s going to change about that anytime soon they have a decent enough balance sheet that they can withstand some I want to understand like what&#39;s the turnaround situation who is running it when it was at 95 who&#39;s running it now what&#39;s their plan to turn it around this one is probably worth doing some work work um I think Buffett owned it for a minute I don&#39;t think he owns anymore so I want to take a look at this if I want Brazilian exposure this one might be the one to look at but no high conviction there yet Martin schling from Vienna Austria schleig schn uh listening to you for a longer time now already well hopefully future investor uh do for my Austrian holding thank you very much for your insights made really nice profits over the last 18 months already good uh video cast is so much fun to listen in all right uh thank you comp you grab okay c m p u g r o u b got hit it hard ctm let&#39;s see comp you group there it is ealth Services worldwide ambulatory Information Systems impatient software again I mean it&#39;s very tough to tell if they have an actual mode of their business uh let&#39;s take a look it&#39;s been a lowquality business for a lot of years I don&#39;t see why that would change $80 million of cash8 they got 80 million of cash and 800 of long-term debt no bueno cash flow is positive free cash flow and what&#39;s happening with the revenues so they must have done a big acquisition here so it&#39;s a broken covid stock um a lot of these broken covid stocks are coming back like Etsy like PayPal like gener uh so there might be something here uh I think that okay so they named a new CEO in May he was chief officer at the German ealth company prior to the oh he was the CFO so they put the CFO in so you just have to understand his turnaround story and why their software has a an impenetrable Moe uh and that takes a lot more work than just looking at the financials um so first thing you want to start to study is who are their competitors and have they been gaining or losing share and try to understand the technology mod which is and I&#39;m not dismissing it this is it&#39;s a very hard exercise and this is why Buffett for so many years avoided software and technology companies um is because the barriers to entry are low and you just have to understand how the software works and why it can&#39;t be disrupted and that&#39;s a hard hard ask um if you can buy it with enough margin of safety that&#39;s a good thing it looks like this thing is turning so I like your your thought process but you really have to understand it otherwise you just put it in the too hard bin Matt tumau thoughts on Intel&#39;s new CEO the interim it&#39;s just a placeholder uh no thoughts uh

we&#39;re not going to know anything for two months so don&#39;t expect miracles unless they panic and appoint the guy who I want from Cadence and they do it quickly um but boards never do that they don&#39;t get paid by the uh the hour miles Frasier really enjoying the podcast wanted to get your thoughts on two stocks JD and Dollar General uh Dollar General we&#39;ve been looking at for a while I think we would probably be more inclined to go with Dollar Tree we&#39;re not doing that because we have enough exposure with a similar low-end consumer cons retailer called Advanced Auto Parts which we like but if we didn&#39;t own Advanced Auto Parts we&#39;d probably take a very serious look at both of Dollar Tree and Dollar General I think they&#39;re going to recover uh and I think it&#39;s going to make time I love the fact that they&#39;re beat down over the Tariff fears because they&#39;re going to be worse than advertised uh better than advertised rather than less less bad uh njd I think that um uh JD JD&#39;s fine but I&#39;d rather play it through Baba because they&#39;ve got the cloud business so um leave it there uh next question comes from thanks miles Alex Ward uh trmd which is a shipper shipping companies are garbage um very cyclical we had a nice move on front line at one point I this is a tough business I mean honestly if you&#39;re gonna go into shipping you&#39;re best to buy the ships when there&#39;s a glut and wait for the cycle to tighten but um that&#39;s not what we do I&#39;ll take a quick look for you but it&#39;s a good way to lose a lot of money is buying shipper equities I remember all the people Lemmings chasing Zim shipping and it was going to go up forever and um it collapsed Fleet of product tankers in the UK see these land Banks and shipping companies these are the things that people confuse as quality value investing versus deep value or special situations and this type of deep value stuff is what gives value investing a bad name because people get bagged in this stuff for 10 years and it never does anything um I generally wouldn&#39;t touch a shipper unless it&#39;s really like a like a 2009 bottom cycle and I&#39;m pretty confident that they&#39;re not going to go bankrupt I understand what you&#39;re seeing here I&#39;m just telling you that there ways to lose a lot of money shippers are are one miners are another this this does look like it&#39;s getting better but to your point you say that Howard marks is currently the main shareholder in selling large chunks of stock which are affecting the share price so he doesn&#39;t need to sell why is he selling what does he know that you don&#39;t know and I don&#39;t I generally don&#39;t want to be on the other side of a trade with Howard marks which is why it interests me that Howard marks is buying the hell out of China ### ASK_ME_ANYTHING_QA why d peer buying the hell out of China so uh higher and better uses I think your thinking framework Alex got you to a good place I just think you&#39;re in the wrong sector to play that game even if the stock price goes up it&#39;s like you&#39;re in a sector where the odds are against you to win from a historical standpoint you get lucky from time to time and make multi-baggers but uh you&#39;ll give it back to the casino because it&#39;s it&#39;s an unsound uh place to allocate Capital Sophie have you looked at wind Resorts new UAE project seems like it would get a boost from the company um when is a China play we&#39;re playing it through Baba I think it&#39;s okay here I don&#39;t think you&#39;re going to get an easy double and we prefer doubles and triples that are pretty easy and pretty predictable with the risk being time and irr that doesn&#39;t really qualify um but it&#39;s a good company ### ASK_ME_ANYTHING_QA Greg says thanks for the analysis on diio I&#39;ve been working on opco what do you think I think it&#39;s a I think it&#39;s a garbage spec play that only has any credibility because Phil Frost has been dumping tons of money in it for years and years and years uh and Phil Frost started tea and he was an investor major investor at the first hedge fund that I worked at and he&#39;s a super smart guy and he&#39;s made a ton of money and this thing he&#39;s been bagged in for literally 16 17 years buying it up at 19 buying it down at a dollar so he obviously thinks it can work he&#39;s one of the smartest Minds in biotech so you have to gamble on if he is he going to be right in the next 18 days or is he going to be right in the next 18 years and I have no Edge on that which is why we own xbi and we&#39;ll take our simple over a few years and uh be Off to the Races but this thing tell me what your Edge is and I&#39;ll tell you whether you should be involved and uh uh for me there I have no Edge on that one Tim Ted do um this is one of the covid Darlings that&#39;s probably starting to show signs of Life everyone&#39;s copying it I don&#39;t really know what the mode is Amazon tried to get into the business everything&#39;s accelerating here ### ASK_ME_ANYTHING_QA um PD I mean this is probably one let&#39;s take a look financials income statement H who put this on quarterly that&#39;s why okay half of my numbers were off because this was switched to quarterly versus annual sorry about that um so revenues are decelerating never good on a Momo stock free cash flow is okay balance sheet 1.2 billion balance sheets okay just don&#39;t understand why they&#39;re losing so much uh what is the charge that let&#39;s see here $2 billion on 300 million of free cash flow with flat sales ### ASK_ME_ANYTHING_QA um look it&#39;s obviously more reasonably priced uh the key is are there any Catalyst for change ### ASK_ME_ANYTHING_QA um let me see what they&#39;re doing with the free cash flow are they buying in shares or are they issuing shares they keep issuing shares or giving shares to themselves I mean the share counts gone from 42 million to 168 million these this management is a bunch of pigs and uh I don&#39;t like that that&#39;s just a warning sign for me they they have no respect for Equity so I&#39;d look at it and just see what is the competition from other players in the market it might be cheap enough but any management that does this to the Share account I have zero respect for so I&#39;m not going to be involved with operators like that ### ASK_ME_ANYTHING_QA Philipe Andrew pinkos agricultural sector yeah I don&#39;t share all my positions so sorry about that ### ASK_ME_ANYTHING_QA Joseph cont top book recommendations to read for Joseph oberti uh tlick over tlick ### ASK_ME_ANYTHING_QA thanks Joseph start with the intelligent investor by Ben Graham read that

you&#39;re going to outperform over time is really what it comes down to uh as so we&#39;ll go through a couple of these bullets because we&#39;ve got a lot of questions  this week as electric vehicle adoption increases we expect double- digit annual growth in global lithium demand generate healthy bromine profits due to its low cost position in the Dead Sea they have the lowest cost um production of bromine uh let&#39;s see here lithium prices will rebound and then remain well above the marginal cost of production to at least the remainder of the decade leading to excess profits and return on invested capital for albam Maro um their Chilean operation is among the world&#39;s lowest cost sources of lithium they have their own salt brine Assets in Chile and the United States and two joint V interests in Australian mines talison green brush bushes and wagina they do the energy storage largest producer one of the world&#39;s largest producers of lithium for battery applications including electric vehicles diverse portfolio of Highly specialized lithium and bromine Solutions and then a lader in refining and petrochemical catalysts they&#39;ve taken a broad set of actions to maintain their long-term competitive position since July and you can see that they&#39;ve hit most of their milestones and they&#39;ve got upside for more they&#39;ve taken a couple hundred million dollar of cost out um and they&#39;re going to get to three to $400 million of cost out they&#39;ve taken their capex down their balance sheet is great they&#39;ve got 3.4 billion of liquidity with $1.7 billion of cash and cash equivalent a $ 1.5 billion revolver so solvency risk is off the table which is a critical thing in turnaround Tom&#39;s checklist of turnarounds uh and um lithium as lithium battery pack prices come down their demand goes up demand out to 2030 you can see here cost advantages resources improving existing resources and accessing non-conventional with direct lithium extraction which will be online next year uh breakthrough OEM opportunities for greater than 50% more EV range with battery material in ation and then the bromine concentration they have in the Dead Sea concentrate in Arkansas is Extreme relative to other places in the world and their industrial cost curve for the elemental bromine is the cheapest in the world where they have the deposits um allocating Capital to the highest return opportunities in sustainability and productivity consistently achieving returns above two times their weighted average cost of capital Target that&#39;s what we like to see the high return on invested Capital over their weighted average cost of capital Global EV demand growth 23% year-to date so we in America it feels like EVS are slowing uh but in China they&#39;re going faster than ever and that&#39;s why you see Elon Musk spending all of his time over in China and focus on China so lithium doesn&#39;t care where it has to go the key is that the overall number in the world is going up and China will be exporting tons of EVS to everywhere in the world except for the United States uh and that will continue to help Alam Maro um so their volumes and energy storage and Specialties were up 16% and 4% respectively jused iov 21 million even in the worst environment cash from operations 241 million and then you can see here the sensitivity to the price of lithium as the price of lithium normalizes the impact on eida you basically get Triple the ebit op for double the price I mean it&#39;s it&#39;s insane uh again this is not fear and greed index not at a level of extreme where you want to get out of everything or even much of anything for that matter ### MEDIA_APPEARANCE_RECAP\n\nclayman&#39;s next Tuesday at 300 PM instead of today

      "here&#39;s the chart several months ago we discussed a new position in albam Maro basis 9322 it&#39;s not a large uh position yet because of the time of initiation there was limited excess uninvested Capital to put to work as new capital came in price ran away from us we don&#39;t buy up we do think we will get additional opportunities to size up this position as more data comes in maybe today we didn&#39;t add yet today but we I&#39;d like to see it back in the 90s before I started to look to size up um but if not we&#39;re okay with what we have Alam Maro is in keeping with our theme to find more materials exposure in 2025 as the sector has been decimated and earnings growth is expected to recover handsomely estimates are for 18.9% earnings growth uh up from 18.7 just a few months ago for 2025 Alba Mar&#39;s primary business is lithium production we can see below the Stock&#39;s most recent Spike and collapse in price from 21 to 24 correlates with the spike and drop of the price of lipian carbonate so car lithium carbonate ripped higher collapsed albam Maro stock price ripped higher collapsed I I generally avoid commodity stocks for this very reason basically because you got to get two things right you got to get the commodity right and you got to get the company operations right um that&#39;s with the exception of oil and natural gas stocks when I can buy the commodity cheaper on the New York Stock Exchange than in the fields I learned that tactic from Reading uh John Paul Getty&#39;s legendary book how to be rich highly recommend for everyone however when you look at Alba maro&#39;s long-term price chart the correlation unravels Alba Marl has historically has a moat around its business which when executing at proper levels can mint money irrespective of the price of the underlying commodity so if you look in the short term you see yeah this huge blip that huge blip actually this one was the 2016 to 18 blip uh and this one was the 2020 to 24 blip um but if you go back further then you had like 10 years and you still had a business That Grew From $5 a share to $65 a share with effectively flat lithium carbonate prices China&#39;s appetite for EVS shows no sign of abating even if in North America sales have softened of late if these estimates prove to be 25% true albamar will not not be able to handle all the demand required in coming years reminds me of Boeing Boeing Boeing&#39;s got 10 years of backlog that&#39;s what&#39;s albam Maro is going to be uh based on current trends Bloomberg NF forecast that by 2027 annual Global sales of Passenger EVS will top 30 million rising to 73 million by 20 40 penetration rates will hit 33% in 2027 73% in 2040 I think that&#39;s optimistic between 2024 to 2027 kager is expected to be around 21% a sharp drop from the 20 to 2023 surge EV stock will grow from 41 million at the end of 2023 to 132 Million by 2027 from their lips to God uh Cooper standard has I believe 20 more per Parts capacity on EV than they do on IES so they make 20% more per car but if you look at this when you look at the American part of this uh you can see why we have such a jaded view like we you can&#39;t even see us on this map rest of the world like you can&#39;t even see where America fits in on this growth all the growth is in China and China&#39;s been pushing the EV so if the government&#39;s pushing it just like they&#39;ll push it to over capacity but again where the Arms Dealer so just like we love selling the sealers and the fluid transfer systems and the fuel delivery of Cooper standard to the oems who are going to race to the bottom overproduce and cut margins like it&#39;s going out of style um same thing with the lithium producer albam Maro let them oversupply flood the market with EVS we benefit from all the lithium required to go in and we&#39;re buying it like Buffett said oh in this one four available at a very attractive price that is the key that most people forget um so you can see again it&#39;s it&#39;s all about China EV demand that&#39;s going to that&#39;s going to benefit lithium that&#39;s going to benefit albam Maro and uh uh as the West Begins to acknowledge the recovery in China as it continues to proliferate and sentiment changes everything with any tie into China is going to go through the roof whether that&#39;s Starbucks whether that&#39;s Estee louder whether that&#39;s her whether that&#39;s Nike whether that&#39;s Lulu whether that&#39;s Alibaba whether that&#39;s albam Maro SE louder uh they&#39;re going to go so fast and it&#39;s going to it&#39;s not going to let anyone in so whether that&#39;s the wec meeting and they say we&#39;re going to do 5% GDP and we&#39;re going to do the stimulus to actually get it done",
      "Chinese manufacturing and it&#39;s going to help albam Maro so um you could see here in the value line estimates they&#39;re expecting a recovery and then a reexpansion out to 2027 2029 but historically you look at this business and the return on Capital has been solid High single digits low double digits for a decade plus return on Equity uh even higher ### FEATURED_COMPANY_DEEP_DIVES\n\nand by the way speaking of turnaround Tom specials uh I was going to speak about Etsy on uh claiming countdown today I got bumped till next Tuesday which I&#39;ll be doing live from California for the first time pretty excited to do that um and etsy&#39;s up you know in the blink of an eye again some of these things slow some of them fast from $49 basis to $59 in a matter of weeks uh any fundamental reason for you know 20% plus move in a few weeks no okay uh so it&#39;s just how it works buy good businesses at attractive prices Take the Long View some happen faster some happen slower but over a a book of 10 to 12 good companies you&#39;re going to outperform over time is really what it comes down to uh as so we&#39;ll go through a couple of these bullets because we&#39;ve got a lot of questions  this week as electric vehicle adoption increases we expect double- digit annual growth in global lithium demand generate healthy bromine profits due to its low cost position in the Dead Sea they have the lowest cost um production of bromine uh let&#39;s see here lithium prices will rebound and then remain well above the marginal cost of production to at least the remainder of the decade leading to excess profits and return on invested capital for albam Maro um their Chilean operation is among the world&#39;s lowest cost sources of lithium they have their own salt brine Assets in Chile and the United States and two joint V interests in Australian mines talison green brush bushes and wagina they do the energy storage largest producer one of the world&#39;s largest producers of lithium for battery applications including electric vehicles diverse portfolio of Highly specialized lithium and bromine Solutions and then a lader in refining and petrochemical catalysts they&#39;ve taken a broad set of actions to maintain their long-term competitive position since July and you can see that they&#39;ve hit most of their milestones and they&#39;ve got upside for more they&#39;ve taken a couple hundred million dollar of cost out um and they&#39;re going to get to three to $400 million of cost out they&#39;ve taken their capex down their balance sheet is great they&#39;ve got 3.4 billion of liquidity with $1.7 billion of cash and cash equivalent a $ 1.5 billion revolver so solvency risk is off the table which is a critical thing in turnaround Tom&#39;s checklist of turnarounds uh and um lithium as lithium battery pack prices come down their demand goes up demand out to 2030 you can see here cost advantages resources improving existing resources and accessing non-conventional with direct lithium extraction which will be online next year uh breakthrough OEM opportunities for greater than 50% more EV range with battery material in ation and then the bromine concentration they have in the Dead Sea concentrate in Arkansas is Extreme relative to other places in the world and their industrial cost curve for the elemental bromine is the cheapest in the world where they have the deposits um allocating Capital to the highest return opportunities in sustainability and productivity consistently achieving returns above two times their weighted average cost of capital Target that&#39;s what we like to see the high return on invested Capital over their weighted average cost of capital Global EV demand growth 23% year-to date so we in America it feels like EVS are slowing uh but in China they&#39;re going faster than ever and that&#39;s why you see Elon Musk spending all of his time over in China and focus on China so lithium doesn&#39;t care where it has to go the key is that the overall number in the world is going up and China will be exporting tons of EVS to everywhere in the world except for the United States uh and that will continue to help Alam Maro um so their volumes and energy storage and Specialties were up 16% and 4% respectively jused iov 21 million even in the worst environment cash from operations 241 million and then you can see here the sensitivity to the price of lithium as the price of lithium normalizes the impact on eida you basically get Triple the ebit op for double the price I mean it&#39;s it&#39;s insane uh again this is not fear and greed index not at a level of extreme where you want to get out of everything or even much of anything for that matter ###
