### December 4th 2024

**Executive Summary**
> Tom Hayes reviews market trends, highlighting potential opportunities in bonds, emerging markets, and specific stocks like Etsy, Albemarle, and Intel. He emphasizes the importance of value investing, taking advantage of market fluctuations, and understanding macro trends.

**Tom's Current Market Conviction: Bullish, anticipating a continued bull run with potential for significant gains in specific sectors and stocks. → 9/10** 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥☆

- Anticipated bidding of bonds in 2025 due to Scott Bessent's treasury plan.
- Expected weakening of the US dollar, benefiting emerging markets and China.
- Positive outlook on specific turnaround situations like Etsy, Albemarle and Intel.

## Macro Thesis & Key Data Points
Hayes anticipates a shift in market leadership from large-cap tech to unmagnified stocks and small caps. He expects bonds to get bid, yields to compress, and the US dollar to weaken. He sees opportunities in emerging markets and China, driven by stimulus and economic recovery. He also believes that the manufacturing recession is ending, fueling the next phase of the bull market.

| Indicator | Value | Tom's Interpretation |
|-----------|-------|----------------------|
| US Auto Sales SAR | 16.5 million | This level could lead Cooper Standard to earn potentially more than $7 a share, similar to 2017 levels. This is amazing news. |
| Bank of America projects policy easing in 2025 | Near 100 basis points | Hayes will take the under on that. He thinks the Fed might do one cut in December, then wait until March for further action. |
| US boom versus global bust | 3.3 standard deviations | This presents an asymmetric opportunity. "Go ahead and bet against that but if you don't take advantage of asymmetric opportunities with some portion of your portfolio you're never going to get seriously rich." |
| China Manufacturing PMI | Turning up from negative to positive | All the things in the stimulus that people are impatient about are coming through. |

## Featured Company Deep Dives
### Etsy – High. Hayes likes this one. Conviction
Etsy is a turnaround story, significantly undervalued after a major drop. It maintains a large user base and free cash flow, with growth potential in international markets, men's products, gifting, and loyalty programs.

**Key Metrics:**
- Third most trafficked retail website with 92 million users
- Free cash flow generation is reaccelerating
- Billion-dollar buyback authorization

**Valuation / Target:** N/A
**Action:** Buy

### Albemarle – High. Hayes wants more materials exposure and hopes for a few more bad days on Albemarle to make it a real position. Conviction
Albemarle is a materials play with exposure to lithium production, benefiting from the increasing demand for EVs, particularly in China. It is currently undervalued due to short-term lithium overcapacity, presenting a buying opportunity.

**Key Metrics:**
- Estimates are for 18.9% earnings growth for 2025
- Solid return on capital and equity
- Low-cost lithium production in Chile

**Valuation / Target:** N/A
**Action:** Buy on dips

### Intel – Moderate. Hayes believes the business is worth $45 to $50 on the legacy business and may be a five plus bagger if they actually get their head on straight. Conviction
Intel is a turnaround situation with a potential new CEO who could revitalize the company. Despite current challenges, Intel holds a significant market share in traditional PCs and servers, making it a potentially lucrative investment.

**Key Metrics:**
- 65% of the market for traditional PCs
- 85% of the server market
- Potential for a new CEO to drive positive change

**Valuation / Target:** Legacy business worth $45-$50. Potential 5x+ bagger if they get their head on straight.
**Action:** Hold. Reinitiate position.
