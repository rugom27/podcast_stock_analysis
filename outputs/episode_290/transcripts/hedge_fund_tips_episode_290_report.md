### N/A

**Executive Summary**
> Tom Hayes is cautiously optimistic, anticipating a high single-digit upside for the S&P 500, potentially reaching low double digits with positive news. He emphasizes the resilience of the US consumer and the potential for international equities to outperform. He highlights opportunities in specific sectors like auto suppliers (Cooper Standard), housing-related stocks (Stanley Black & Decker, Generac, QXO), and Chinese equities (Alibaba). He believes that bears are praying for a retest of the lows, but forced buying due to trade deal announcements will likely push the market higher. He also notes that the market is in a similar position to the 2018 recovery in Trump 1.0.

**Tom's Current Market Conviction: Cautiously Bullish → 7/10** 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥☆☆☆

- Earnings and guidance are holding up well.
- Potential for trade deal announcements to drive market higher.
- US consumer remains resilient.
- International equities offer potential outperformance.
- Market sentiment is still skeptical, leaving room for upside.

## Macro Thesis & Key Data Points
The US economy is more resilient than people think, and the negative GDP print was a wake-up call for the administration to show flexibility on tariffs. The US consumer is strong, and the labor market is holding up. International equities are poised to outperform US equities in the next 10 years due to valuation and earnings growth opportunities. A weaker dollar will also support international equities and boost tourism in the US.

| Indicator | Value | Tom's Interpretation |
|-----------|-------|----------------------|
| Consumer Balance Sheet | Assets: $190 trillion vs Liabilities: $20 trillion | Consumers are well-capitalized, creating opportunities for increased spending as rates come down. |
| Q1 Earnings Growth | 12.8% vs 6% expected | Earnings are strong and guidance is better than expected, indicating a resilient economy. |
| US Dollar | Expected to trend down | A weaker dollar will boost international equities and increase tourism in the US. |
| Retail Inventories | Near record lows | Retailers will need to rebuild inventories, supporting production and economic growth. |
| Earnings Estimates for 2026 | $302 on the S&P | Implies an 18.5x multiple, which is not crazy compared to a 10-year average of 18.3x |
