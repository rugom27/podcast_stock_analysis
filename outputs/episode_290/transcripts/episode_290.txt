Welcome to Hedge Fund Tips with Tom Hayes. I&#39;m Tom Hayes and this is your 290th videocast podcast for the week ending May 8th, 2025. Got a lot of great stuff to cover today, but as always, family first. Let&#39;s get right down to it. Uh this is Annabelle. We&#39;ll cover both. Mimi played in the San Diego County Cup this weekend and had some rockstar goals. She plays pretty much the entire game and sprints non-stop the entire game. She only has one speed, fifth gear. Uh they call her wild pony because she flies down the pool and no one can catch her and she plows through defenders to score. Annabelle also played in the San Diego County Cup and balanced a swim meet in Irvine and the Southern California swimming banquet in Garden Grove where she received an award for her national ranking. She currently leads the country in number one rankings for 10 and under girls. So congratulations. They did a rockstar job. That&#39;s the banquet. Ah, this is my friend Jason Berlinger. Thank you so much. That&#39;s the 18th hole of Big Canyon. Again, want to thank you for having me on. Jason&#39;s got an incredible book of business at Morgan Stanley. So, those of you who need, you know, loans for financing, stock loans, estate planning, he is a wealth manager and does a great job. Feel free to reach out and uh I can connect you. Uh this is interesting. This was not far from where I live. I was walking to get dinner and look at the tires on this bicycle. This is like a beach bicycle or something. The tires say Vans. This is I&#39;ve never seen that. I didn&#39;t know Vans was now in the tire business. But uh one more thing that is not priced into the stock. I don&#39;t know how serious that is, but I thought it was pretty cool. um talked to the two kids that were working in the store. They didn&#39;t know anything, of course. Uh then I want to thank my buddy Brad Schmidt for having me uh to Pelican Hill. We played the South Course, which was just absolutely incredible. Brad does commercial real estate. So, if you&#39;re a big company looking to rent out commercial space, uh or buy or sell or rent or lease or anything in that space in Southern California, this guy is a pro. and he also does nationwide syndications, Utah, that type of thing. Uh that&#39;s uh Eli, Steve. We had an unbelievable time at the scramble. We came in -12 on the day. Um uh dropped a few putts which was pretty cool and I think -15 won. But I got to be honest with you, that group was in front of us and we saw them taking a lot of mulligans. So, I&#39;m I&#39;m not saying, you know, congratulations, but just saying saying, not saying. Uh there&#39;s some beautiful there&#39;s the ocean. You know, it it doesn&#39;t suck out here. I&#39;ll leave it at that. Um all right, then a couple goals and we&#39;ll get down to it. So, this is one of Mimi&#39;s. She gets the pass here and she&#39;s just a beast. Boom. All right. And then last one and we&#39;ll get down to it here. Taking it inside. Boom. All right. Rocking and rolling. So, um, also one, uh, wearing the t-shirt today. Thank you for, uh, all the incredible support. The key here is to get the word out. you know, I wear this uh, you know, walking by the beach and everything and I get tons of questions all the time. I tell them about the podcast. More people we share this with, the more we&#39;re going to just keep delivering this incredible value for you guys for a very, very long time. Uh, in addition to what we do for our clients. Uh, so, so it&#39;s just incredible. I think what we&#39;re going to do because we got so many more orders than we expected. Um, and again, this is the t-shirt by the way. Uh, very cool. And this is the I&#39;m got my mug today. Very excited. Price is what you pay, value is what you get, and then hedge fund tips on the back, uh, with Tom Hayes. So, um, so under this, when you go to hedge fund tips, first off, click on terms. This is all opinion, not advice. Number two, when you click on number one hedge fund podcast, we&#39;re ranked uh by Feedspot. Um, and you scroll down, we talk about testimonials and merchandise, where you can get the merchandise, etc. Uh, and the testimonials, by the way, we have like 10 pages of testimonials, and we haven&#39;t even scraped them in like a year and a half. So, my assistant Jennifer is going to start scraping all the testimonials off of y YouTube and emails that uh have gone into trash over the years, and we&#39;re going to get a lot more testimonials. But what we&#39;re also going to do, uh, and not everyone&#39;s going to do this, but the ones that do, we&#39;re going to build a little hedge fun community, hedge fun tips community. And like we did with the burden yourself with the fax hats, um, those of you who get merchandise, whether you you got your mug, uh, or you&#39;ve got your hat or you got your t-shirt or your hoodie or your golf shirt, uh, and you want to send in a picture, email it to info@hedgefundtips.com. info@hedgefundtips.com. And I think what we&#39;re going to start to do over time is post some of these pictures right here before the testimonials. And hopefully over a number of years, you know, we could have, you know, dozens of pictures here, uh, of people from all over the world, uh, wearing their merch and, uh, showing their part of the community. I think that would just be a lot of fun. So, it&#39;s more than just, um, uh, anonymous handles behind the comments. You could actually see their names. And you could submit that with or without your name. That&#39;s up to you, uh, in terms of, uh, privacy, etc. So, moving on. Um, next week I I leave tomorrow. I&#39;ll see some friends up in Connecticut. Play some golf at my club there. And then on Monday morning I&#39;ll be on Schwab at Schwab Network at 8:40. NYSC live with Kristen Scher at 9. And then uh the 12:00 or 1:00 hour, I&#39;m not sure which hour. I&#39;ll be on the whole hour on Fox Business. It&#39;s called the Big Money Show. Uh Taylor Riggs, Brian Baronburgg, Jackie D&#39;Angelus, uh and D in for that. Then on Tuesday in the morning, sometime between 9 and 12, I will be on Varnian Co. Super excited about that.

And then 300 p.m. I cap off the three days of media with the incredible Liz Clayman at 3:00 on Wednesday. So be sure to tune in for those episodes. And then I&#39;m off to uh Palm Beach to see my buddy Mike Bennett, who uh I know I&#39;ve mentioned in the past, he&#39;s an incredible businessman, but uh he also wrote the book Stack and Tilt uh Golf with Andy Plameumber. They&#39;ve trained more PGA Pros than you have any idea. Um uh it&#39;s always confidential, but if you ever go down to take lessons with them, you&#39;ll see five guys lined up behind you that you recognize on TV. Uh, so I&#39;m going to play with him and then um then we&#39;ve got the uh uh meeting with the speakers down at the Money Show in Miami. I&#39;ll be speaking on three segments on Friday. I&#39;ll be speaking Saturday at around lunch and then a private room after that. So, three segments and then I fly to Dubai to see my friends and clients out there. And I&#39;m also going to uh meet with some of the YPO guys on my last day and then back. So, it&#39;s going to be a whirlwind. Exciting May. Off to an exciting start. Um and uh and that&#39;s that. Now, let&#39;s get you some context for the market because I had the privilege to go on with David Lynn. And for those of you who know, David is one of the a really phenomenal interviewer and he always pulls out the best responses from his guests and then his audience who are totally engaged, write all kinds of comments underneath the YouTube uh video. But uh uh it&#39;s just phenomenal and we went into a lot of great stuff and you&#39;ll see some preions here and you&#39;ll see some substance for for what&#39;s to come. Uh and I think you&#39;ll find it really really valuable. So we&#39;re going to listen in here. People are saying the world is ending and they feel depressed and then they&#39;re going out and spending like there&#39;s no tomorrow. Uh and and uh the question is does how does that resolve track? I would not be surprised that at the end of the year we&#39;re up you know 7 and 9% on the S&amp;P 500. If we overshoot, you know, looking at some of these bre historic breath indicators, the swag breath indicator has triggered, maybe we&#39;ll be up low double digits, you know, 10, 11, 12%, but there&#39;s still uh tremendous opportunities. Can the stock markets continue their momentum? Is this the beginning of the end of a bare market or we still in a bare market rather? We&#39;ll find out with our next guest, Thomas Hayes, a managing member of Great Hill Capital. Well, Thomas, it&#39;s always great to get a hedge fund manager&#39;s perspective on what&#39;s happening in the markets. Welcome back to the show. Good to see you. Thanks for having me, David. Good to be here. Last time you were on the show was in January, so wow, time flies. We got to get you on the show more often. Um, apologies for not following up sooner, but uh, time just flew. So, uh, lots happened in the last couple months, which probably probably was why time flew by so quickly. Let&#39;s re let&#39;s evaluate what you told me earlier in the year. you had told me that well people should watch the full length interview down below but I think in the beginning of the year you were a little more cautious in 2025 than you were let&#39;s say the same period in 2024 last year when you were on my show a year ago. So have things played out the way you expected to so far? Anything caught you off by surprise? Obviously, the magnitude of the tariffs caught a lot of fund managers off, but where were you and in terms of positioning uh on April 1st, April 2nd? Yeah, I think look in early February and March, we were on public networks talking about uh time to buckle up, buttercup, we&#39;re going to get some volatility. Uh I thought we would get an, you know, 8 to 10% seasonal pullback. Uh certainly some tariff uncertainty and that type of thing. Uh did I expect a 19% uh peak to trough draw down on the S&amp;P? No. But it was really an unbelievable blessing in disguise. It was uh certainly a a manmade correction. But you know, one of the themes that uh I said in the beginning of the year, despite to your point, we were certainly more cautious and less sanguin for 2025 than we were in 2024. Um, I did say that uh our expectations were basically uh mid to high uh singledigit returns for the S&amp;P uh 500 which was uh considered bearish at the turn of the year by the way. Everyone was so juiced up on 2024 returns and we&#39;re like yeah you know more more subdued and uh oddly enough David I think we are that&#39;s going to be on track. I would not be surprised that it at the end of the year we&#39;re up, you know, 7 and 9% on the S&amp;P 500. If we overshoot, you know, looking at some of these bre historic breath indicator, the swag breath indicator has triggered, maybe we&#39;ll be up low double digits, you know, 10, 11, 12%. But, uh, it&#39;s meaningfully up from here. And if you look at the average stock relative to the S&amp;P, there&#39;s still uh tremendous opportunities and and great things to do uh in this environment. But but I I think that the the key theme, David, is uh welcome to Trump 2.0, same as Trump 1.0. Uh tweet volatility resolves to the upside over time. and looking at that analog which we were considering two uh during this draw down. One was the 2018 Trump uh trade war 1.0 where you had a 20% correction really quickly and the market resolved to new highs within four months. And then we were also looking at a longer more drawn out scenario of 2011. The European debt crisis 20% correction took eight months to resolve to new highs. Uh so we we&#39;ll see which one this is. Right now, it&#39;s leaning closer to the 2018 with a higher upside, but we&#39;re going to need some more pauses in tariffs and uh and we do have a lot of businesses on hold waiting for more clarity. So, that&#39;s that&#39;s not a constructive thing in the short term. Okay. Uh let&#39;s talk about tariffs first and then we&#39;ll revisit your S&amp;P 500 call that you just made. So, here&#39;s from uh Bloomberg. Trump suggests some deals. Trade deals may come as early as this week. It could be very it could very well be. Trump told reporters on Sunday when asked whether any trade agreements were coming this week. He didn&#39;t specify any countries were we&#39;re negotiating with many countries, but at the end of this I&#39;ll set my own deals because I set the deal. They don&#39;t set the deal. You kept asking the same question. When will you agree? It&#39;s up to me. It&#39;s not up to them. I suppose he doesn&#39;t mean China. There&#39;s still 145% tariff on China, I believe. Uh but anyway, I&#39;ll let you evaluate what&#39;s going on. Yeah, look, I think the the number one thing that the market needed to see and and I have to say this was a strange correction because I had um more peers, colleagues, money managers calling me in abject fear than I&#39;ve ever seen in a correction. And I had clients calling me because they know this is when these are the periods that I I thrive. Uh calling me and asking me how they could send more money in to take advantage of the opportunities. And many of them did. So very interesting scenario um and consistent with what you saw in the stats that hedge funds were and CTAs were record sellers of equities over a trillion dollars at the absolute low in early April. Apparently they were not on truth stocial when President Trump said now is a good time to buy because that marked a low uh in the stock market. So, um, so, so the problem with that is that these quote unquote investors have been praying for a retest of the lows and praying rarely works in investing. So every single tape bomb of a deal with India or a deal with Japan or a deal with uh you know some tiny island nation whatever it happens to be they are going to be forced mechanical buyers. They are upside down and now they&#39;re just trying to stem the bleeding and the redemptions from missing uh not only selling at the wrong time but more importantly missing the opportunity to buy at the right time. Uh and if you look at what&#39;s happened with earnings, I mean, yes, it&#39;s rearview mirror, but with 80% of the companies reporting, you have 12.8% earnings growth, uh compared to 6% that was expected. And estimates, yes, they&#39;ve come down a little bit for 2024. They&#39;ve come down about 3.5% year-to date, but they bottomed about a week and a half ago at 265 for 2025 on the S&amp;P. They&#39;re now up to 266, which tells you guidance is actually starting to improve. And for 2026, estimates have held in. So, we&#39;ve got a lot of backend loaded earnings at 302, which implies an 18 1.5 times multiple, which is not crazy, uh, compared to a 10-year average of 18.3 times. So, uh, that&#39;s kind of where I&#39;m thinking. And uh the other thought that I have on tariffs, David, is that I think you wind up with a net 10% across the board, which is 300 to400 billion. Uh which is which is great from a refinance the debt standpoint, bring down rate standpoint, spur the housing market standpoint, uh and um uh improve the cost of living standpoint. That coupled with low gas prices and a lot of other things uh are a good formula. Now, if we start to see Navaro on TV every day, then we could have problems. But uh so far, they&#39;ve kept him in the closet and uh it&#39;s been mostly Bessant and a little bit of Lutnik here and there. Uh and I think Trump is showing a lot of flexibility and rationality, which the market was unclear whether that was going to be coming uh following liberation day. you said to Reuters and I&#39;ll pull up um uh this quote from actually your website hedge fund tips you extracted this I do think that what today is saying is that the economy is a lot stronger than what uh people thought and a lot more resilient in the face of all these tariffs and fears about tariffs um which signals or indicators signal to you resilience Thomas I think earning earnings and guidance are the name of the game I think when you look at the negative GDP print. I think that was a good wakeup call for the administration. Uh the bad news is you got a negative GDP print and like 2022, if you get two quarters in a row of negative GDP prints, you have a technical recession and I believe we had a recession in 2022 even though the uh um the council did not define it as such. Uh all the activity and all of the results were consistent with the recession. So, I think it was a wakeup call like, hey, you are threading this needle. You&#39;re trying to cut this money on Doge, you&#39;re trying to uh balance the budget, etc. If you tip into a recession, it&#39;s going to cost you way more to bring us out of a recession uh in terms of lost revenue, in terms of stimulus, than it would be to just do nothing. So, your Doge cuts will be in vain. Uh all of the fiscal constraints and layoffs will have been in vain if you tip into recession. So while the negative uh 30 basis points print for Q1 GDP was uh um not the the the clearest because if you back out the inventory building and the reduction of government spending, you&#39;re at plus 3% GDP. So it&#39;s not what you would normally see in a negative print. It still is a negative print and I can assure you the administration does not want to see two consecutive quarters of negative prints because that is a technical recession and that creates all kinds of problems. So they want to they want they immediately did an about face. They you know paused the tariffs showed flexibility with the auto industry uh showed uh flexibility with negotiating deals with counterparties. So I think in that sense uh it was a wakeup call. I think they&#39;re going to wind up with it will look like they&#39;re, you know, they&#39;re blinking on these deals, but at the end of the day, they&#39;re going to wind up with 300 to 400 billion dollars of uh tariff revenue. And um if they had started with a 10% ask, we&#39;d be lucky if we got 30 or 40. So they asked for the world, they wound up with something bigger than anyone could have ever ever imagined. And it keeps the train on the tracks. it doesn&#39;t uh uh you know try that the the light at the end of the tunnel is not an oncoming train which people were worried about in early April. It&#39;s actually the end of the tunnel. What are you expecting consumer sentiment or consumer demand to do for the next quarter? I I&#39;ll give you some examples. So uh earlier in the year we had data come in that advanced retail sales continue to grind higher. A lot of that came from uh actually trucks and cars uh new and old. people were just buying them before the new tariff prices kicked in. Um, do you expect that trend to continue? Do you expect strength to continue at all? I do. I think look, you never bet against the US consumer when they have a job. And we saw the jobs report. We saw the unemployment rate stay at 4.2%. Job non-farm payrolls came in better than expected. There&#39;s an interesting dichotomy right now between the hard data and the soft data. what people say they feel and what they actually do. People are saying the world is ending and they feel depressed and then they&#39;re going out and spending like there&#39;s no tomorrow. Uh and and uh the question is does how does that resolve? Does their sentiment start to improve consistent with their actions as more deals are announced or does their actions start to catch up to their sentiment which is what the bears are worried about uh if this thing drags out longer? Um there was someone on Twitter today saying uh the next step should be a 180day pause. Maybe we&#39;ll see something like that if they don&#39;t get a deal announced this week. Uh but I but I think that now the American public is seeing some rationality and not rigidity on behalf of the administration. We&#39;re going to get more than we would have gotten. Uh but we&#39;re not going to blow up the world to do it and create a depression or a recession. Uh I think people&#39;s sentiment will improve. And the thing about the cars, it&#39;s a lot of different things coming together at once. Number one, dealer incentives are going up. I know this I know this industry like the back of my hand because our largest position is an auto parts supplier, which I&#39;ve talked to your audience about called Cooper Standard, which was up 43% on Friday and probably another few percent today. Um they supply the ceiling systems uh around the windows and doors and the fluid transfer systems uh for uh new automobiles predominantly to US OEMs. And the big deal there what we&#39;ve been watching it&#39;s a play on the volume recovery which troughed at 15.2 million SAR. We expect it to get to normalized levels like it has every cycle for the last 40 years of 17 12 to 18 million SAR. Uh they make money on that volume. There are a couple of things. First and foremost is the average car on the road is 13.5 years. So yeah, they&#39;re going to continue to buy. Number two, dealer incentives are going up. They had this cartel during COVID that they really took advantage of people selling above MSRP and they kept that game going afterwards saying our our supply is limited, our supply is limited. Uh and that gig is up. So now it&#39;s going to be a race to the bottom for OEMs. They&#39;re going to put out massive volumes across the board and they&#39;re going to compete on price and incentives which means volumes are going to go up and uh just like generators when you know when when your neighbor has them and they&#39;re watching TV while you&#39;re sitting in the dark during a power outage. Uh you get one the next time. It&#39;s the same with new cars there. There haven&#39;t been a lot of new cars. Uh as your neighbors start to get them, you&#39;re going to get them. And with incentives and with rates coming down, Besson&#39;s going to bring down that 10-year yield uh by eliminating some bank charges. uh uh and deregulation on that front. I think a lot of good things are going to happen uh with with consumer spending and I think a lot of it is going to be concentrated in the automobile industry because it&#39;s needed. 13.5 years is uh the oldest the fleet has ever been and we have uh 72 some odd millennials that need cars, starting new families, moving out to the suburbs, etc. Yeah, that I wonder what that&#39;s going to do to the auto industry. Just let us know, we&#39;ll move on. Uh clearing inventory. I I just happened to have walked into a Tesla dealership yesterday while I was waiting for something else and they told me that uh the they have the inventory prices for their models in inventory and then they have the tariff prices if you order online that&#39;s going to come in a couple that&#39;s like 20 grand more for every model which is a big number for Canada. So yeah, that that sounds like a sales pitch. they won&#39;t get away with that because there&#39;s so there&#39;s so much supply that&#39;s coming on and and then everyone that&#39;s worried about oh this was a one-time pull pull forward well they&#39;re going to now have to replenish those inventories and they&#39;re and all the manufacturers are going to be doing it which is going to create a lot of supply and a lot of incentives so um you know Tesla if if Tesla believes that they&#39;re going to get a rude awakening call as they bring prices down in coming months this is why we should go shopping with Tom Hayes but uh Tom uh tell us about the FOMC See, we&#39;re expecting a um a no uh no action from the FOMC. Well, that&#39;s what the uh markets are expecting for this week. Um what&#39;s happening for the rest of the year? How many rate cuts are we expecting, if any, are you expecting? Yeah, it&#39;s interesting. You know, we saw uh last week, we we saw negative GDP. We saw the PCE come in the lowest it&#39;s been, which is the Fed favored number. Uh lowest it&#39;s been since November. Uh so those were the two pieces, but what what have they been talking about? Waller and the Cleveland governor, uh they&#39;ve all been saying we&#39;re watching the labor market. So we saw the ADP was weak and we&#39;re like, okay, if the jobs numbers weak, the Fed could move, you know, soon. Uh jobs number was very strong. So it might be a little bit backward looking, but uh certainly 100% takes May off the table. June is uh you know was at 65% odds. It&#39;s probably a little lower now. I&#39;d say June is a coin flip. I still am of the camp we&#39;re getting to before the end of the year. Your overall tone reminds me of uh Warren Buffett&#39;s speech over the weekend when he announced his retirement. The time has arrived where Greg should become the chief executive officer of the company at year end. And I want to spring that on the directors effectively and give that as my recommendation. He said uh he was very lucky to have b to have been born in America. Uh I&#39;m paraphrasing here, but we should continue to invest in America and uh long-term he&#39;s very bullish on the prospects of capitalism in America. I&#39;m guessing you largely agree, but how do we make that an investment thesis here? Yeah, look, Buffett is my hero. Um I learned so much from him and Charlie over the years. It&#39;s it&#39;s shaped a lot of who I am. Obviously, I have my own uh special sauce. turnaround, Tom. I like I like more turnarounds, more of what Buffett was doing when he was running outside money the first 12 years than what what he did during Birkshire. Uh look, US exceptionalism will never change. And the reason that will never change is because we because of immigration. I mean, that&#39;s fundamentally what it comes down to is we&#39;ve had the best ideas and the best minds and the risktakers from around the world who took a chance and came to America. And it&#39;s that this repository of the best of everything in the world in one place plus natural resources plus good defense borders. So that&#39;s never going to change. Now does that mean US equities have to outperform because America is so great? Uh no. If and if you are willing to look past a little recency bias of the last decade, you&#39;ll see that every 10 to 15 years, you run in cycles where uh dollar is strong and US equities outperform, which is what you&#39;ve seen in the zero interest rate policy uh period post great financial crisis plus a few extra years. Uh but then if you look back even during Reagan, there were period there was a big period there that international equities outperformed US. Not because US wasn&#39;t great, not because re Reagan&#39;s policies were were bad or the rest of the world got better than the US. It&#39;s just a normal cycle. Some of it has to do with US dollar currency. Some of it has to do with earnings power. But it is a regular cycle every 10 to 15 years. International outperforms US then US outperforms international. And I do think we are on the cusp where we&#39;re going into and have already started actually a period where international equities uh outperform and that could simply be a function of multiples as uh mag 7 have been more subdued uh and um uh their waiting starts to normalize in the S&amp;P 500 the index&#39;s weights and composition may start to look a bit closer to international And then you&#39;ve got some earnings growth in some international pockets which is really exciting like China Tech uh etc. that could start to take up some of the weight in the international indices and then the institutional flows and it&#39;s a it&#39;s a flywheel you know as more money goes in the multiples go up that which creates more more flow which is what the US has benefited from for the last 15 years and I think we&#39;re probably going to moderate relative returns even though we&#39;ll have good returns we&#39;ll moderate relative returns and I think the outperformers are going to be the ones that have exposure to international in the next 10 years that was my next question if not the US equity Where should we go for outperformance? Well, look, I I talked about Cooper Standard, which was a US company. We have a huge position in uh we&#39;ve had a huge position in Alibaba. I mean, and that&#39;s been, you know, couple years in waiting. Every red day we&#39;ve been buying stock and it, you know, it&#39;s it&#39;s now rallied and and uh we&#39;ve got a a average basis across all accounts of about $83. We think that&#39;s just getting started. Now, we&#39;ve got the problem that you got all these politicians that say, &quot;Let&#39;s torch US investors and delist it and uh and cost US investors $800 billion,&quot; which would be the dumbest political move of all time uh to torch. It doesn&#39;t hurt China to delist Chinese companies. It&#39;s not Chinese investors that are buying US ADRs. It only hurts US investors. So, we&#39;ve shifted all of our equity exposure to Hong Kong Holdings just in case stupid political decisions are made, but uh we still do own some uh derivative exposure in uh in the US and we&#39;ll just absorb that risk uh because we can&#39;t replicate it in Hong Kong. But the bulk of our allocation is now held in Hong Kong shares just to hedge out that uh that D-listing risk which I think was more acute a couple of years ago when it ultimately came through with flying colors through the PCAOB. Uh and I&#39;m sure this is probably some part of the negotiating leverage with China. Come to the table and do a deal or we will take away your access to US capital markets. and it&#39;s being fostered by a couple actors like Rick Scott and others who are the headline grabbers for the negotiating leverage with China. But I think when all is said and done, I&#39;d assign maybe a you know, it&#39;s it&#39;s a lot less than a coin flip odds of delisting. Uh I&#39;d say it&#39;s probably 20% because it only it only hurts us. I think if they really were sincere about it, what they would do is say u we&#39;re not going to screw the US investor. we you know what what&#39;s what&#39;s listed here is going to stay listed here but we are closing the door to any new offerings in the US prospectively that would be like a sincere um uh play where I would I&#39;d be more concerned if that was the case because that would that would tell me that they&#39;ve actually thought it through it wasn&#39;t just an anti-China sentiment um and and if they had thought it through and then they cut off capital markets I mean all that effectively happens is you take billions of dollars of fees that go to US banks and you push them out to London and you push them out to Hong Kong exchanges. Uh which again hurts the US more than it hurts China. But um if that&#39;s the if that&#39;s the direction they take policy, we we&#39;ve hedged because what they can&#39;t do by delisting them is change the earnings power of an Alibaba or a 10 cent. Uh and the free cash flow they generate and the amount of shares that they buy back and the the number one AI play in the world right now, their Quen 2.5 is outperforming Deepseek. It&#39;s outperforming ChatG GPT and they own a equity stake in pretty much every AI startup in China because they give them cloud computing services. They&#39;re number one in cloud computing in exchange uh for equity in their companies. So uh there&#39;s a lot of outs uh like we we like to say in poker by owning Alibaba. You got the number one toll taker as the Chinese government wants to uh move the Chinese economy to 70% consumption over the next 10 years. Alibaba will get 40 cents on every dollar as a toll taker goes through Alibaba. Um and uh a lot a lot of positive things happening. So China uh certainly opportunities in in beating down Europe um uh emerging markets etc. So there are a lot of things to do and there are a lot of things to do in the US if you&#39;re not in the indices and you&#39;re not in the most crowded trades. There are a lot of companies that are still very undervalued. Are you ready to meet the biggest minds in Bitcoin face to face?

We&#39;ll see you in Vegas. Are you betting on the Chinese economy uh when you&#39;re investing in Hong Kong equities at all? uh are you exposed to Chinese growth? For example, I was reading just now uh China&#39;s exports rose 6.9% in Q1 2025 despite despite the ongoing trade wars uh with the US. Uh Chinese officials recently said the sky won&#39;t fall for China&#39;s exports uh especially since they&#39;re diverting a lot of their USbound exports to um other countries in Southeast Asia and perhaps domestic consumers. So um what&#39;s your take on Chinese growth here? 100%. It&#39;s a dimminitimous portion. Like it&#39;s almost I I I think if the apocalypse happened and there was a US embargo on Chinese goods, I think it would affect Chinese GDP by 1 to one and a half%. So um you know I they they&#39;ve kind of been preparing for this number one. Number two, they already devalued the yuan by like 20%. So it&#39;s like oh you want to char us 20%. We&#39;ve already priced that in. So thank you very much. If you want to do a deal we&#39;ll appreciate the yuan. So, it&#39;s kind of silly season and uh uh I understand why they&#39;re doing it. And by the way, there&#39;s a deal to be done because the US, if you look at the percentage of manufacturing versus consumption in China versus the percentage of manufacturing versus consumption in the US, it&#39;s like a 20 point spread. And they just basically want to meet in the middle middle. If we got 10 more points of manufacturing and they got 10 more points of consumption, it&#39;s a win for both countries. So, they&#39;re going to do a deal. There&#39;s probably no no dlisting. if they don&#39;t do a deal, it hurts their GDP one one and a half percent and they&#39;ll just, you know, amp up the stimulus which helps companies like Alibaba. Am I making making a bet on China uh China&#39;s economy? Implicitly yes. But Alibaba got so undervalued as a sum of the parts. I mean at you know between the number one cloud provider, number one retailer to the middle class. So as their economy is recovering and the stimulus has kicked in um there there just so you know the the demand for compute power uh and AI and everything going on with Alibaba there there&#39;s just nothing like it in the world where price is what you pay value is what you get quoting Warren Buffett uh that you could have done this and yeah it&#39;s up a bunch from where we own it but I think it&#39;s just getting started so uh irrespective of whether they do a good deal or bad deal? Obviously, I&#39;d prefer a good deal that makes sense for both parties and I think President Trump wants a good deal for both parties. Uh he&#39;s more of a pragmatist than an idealist and that&#39;s started to come out in recent weeks. But if you read all his books, he always starts with punch you in the face first and then offer you an ice pack and that&#39;s how he gets to a final deal. So, all right. Well, so Hong Kong equities, what about other asset classes? like diversified across other asset classes outside of equities as a hedge. Uh we&#39;re we&#39;re an equity manager. So we run a concentrated equity portfolio with derivative overlay for family offices and ultra high net worth individuals. Um so I guess not. So so the answer is is is no. But I could see a scenario where so we would express it through equities. Uh you know materials have been left for dead. I think uh I think there are some commodity plays to be had. You know, we we have had a view when it was unpopular uh that the dollar was going to continue to weaken. Now that everyone is kind of in that boat, we probably get a counter trend bounce in the short term uh and then resume the the intermediate downtrend uh a few months out. But uh you know, when you see it on the cover of the Economist and Baronss at uh end of the dollar, it&#39;s like all right, so now we&#39;re going to get a bounce. So, uh, uh, I I I definitely like materials. I like some commodity plays. I&#39;m trying to figure out how to get more exposure to energy. We&#39;ve got a big position in comtock resources from just below $9. It&#39;s it&#39;s up a lot. It&#39;s a natural gas play on the Hannesville. Jerry Jones, the owner of the Cowboys, owns 66% of that. Uh, so we&#39;re trying to figure out maybe oil servicesers, try not to play the price of oil, but just the volume. Kind of like what we did with the auto industry. We don&#39;t want to be in the OEMs, the car manufacturers. We want to be in the the arms dealers, the suppliers. Let the car manufacturers duke it out. Race to the bottom in terms of margins and let the suppliers benefit from volume. I think that&#39;s going to be the case with uh you know natural gas is a covert play on AI demand uh and compute demand running the data centers. We we need unlimited amounts of energy and I think natural gas is going to be the transition. So there&#39;s a lot to do there as well. Interesting. Uh final question since you brought up what people are feeling. What is the prevailing sentiment in the equities markets right now? Uh we&#39;ve had a bit of a rebound as I mentioned in the beginning and we talked about this. Um is it still one of fear and uncertainty or are people more uh a little more bullish now in May? If you look at the sentiment indicators and you look at the positioning, yes, VIX has come down. Yes, you&#39;ve had the breath thrust. I think people are still skeptical and I think I think there are a lot of bears that are angry and are are praying to God that they see a retest of the lows. And my guess is we&#39;ll get a couple of deals and maybe consolidate, you know, get a get a few percent pull back in in coming weeks and the bears will think that they&#39;re on track and it&#39;s going to go back and retest and then we we push higher and higher because the earnings and the guidance, I mean, the fact that we can have this level of guidance and still looking at $32 of earnings in 2026 despite knowing all of this chaos, uh, is telling me that, god forbid we get any good news, the pent-up demand. I mean, you know, I see it and feel it just in my daily life at the restaurants, at, you know, shopping, at the malls, etc., travel. I mean, people don&#39;t seem to have a care in the world from what I can see. I I I certainly hear it in the conference calls of the at the very lower end. Uh, there is some strain, uh, etc. And we understand that, but to the, you know, to circle back, people still have jobs. And when people have jobs in America, they tend to spend. Excellent. Well, uh let&#39;s uh let&#39;s see what uh happens later in the year. Your track record on my show has been pretty impeccable so far. So, uh if you&#39;re bullish, then we should pro probably look at that as a as a signal. Um I&#39;m just wondering whether or not the to my previous question, I&#39;m just wondering whether or not there was a strong sentiment that we could play as a counter trend, but it seems like people are kind of on the fence right now. Yeah, I Yeah, I think you know the the extreme that was a no-brainer was in early April and uh and we were kind of identifying that on our podcast. Uh I think at this point the the the bears know they&#39;re screwed, so they&#39;re just praying for a second bite at the apple to be able to buy at new lows. and the bulls that you know usually what happens is everyone probably bought up on Thursday and Friday after 8 n days up and so those people need to get punished so my guess is you&#39;ll see some short-term volatility in the coming weeks maybe a few% pullback just to hurt the Johnny come latelys and then when the bears think they&#39;re back in control we rip higher and that would be consistent with what we saw in the 2018 recovery in Trump 1.0 I know. So, look, those are best guesses. I mean, at the end of the day, I just like to look at companies and what I did on uh I did a call on April 7th for my clients and we went through company by company just the free cash flow and the balance sheet and we&#39;re like, look, the worst case scenario could happen. These things are priced priced for that and if you get any possible good news, we&#39;re going to have the most incredible uh few months uh we&#39;ve ever seen. And that&#39;s that&#39;s been the case in the last few weeks. It&#39;s been insane uh to the upside. And uh fortunately I have really incredibly smart clients who uh were sending in a ton of money at the lows to buy stocks uh versus the opposite. So very grateful on that front and um you know we take it week by week as the facts change we adjust our viewpoint but on balance uh what we said in the beginning of the year I think is going to hold true. I I like the high single digits upside for the S&amp;P 500 and uh maybe a little more if we get a lot of good news, but uh it&#39;ll be it&#39;ll be some bumps between now and then to get there and just uh use those as opportunities. All right, perfect. Thank you. Where can we follow you Thomas? Uh yeah, on X Twitter I&#39;m hedge fun. On Tik Tok, a huge following official hedge fund tips. Same on Instagram, official hedge fun.

Thank you for watching. Don&#39;t forget to like and subscribe. and we&#39;re back. So, thanks to David Lynn for that. Uh, also want to thank um had a chance to talk to Andrea Hang and Haranto Deon uh about Warren Buffett&#39;s retiring and the future of Bergkshire Hathway. I know a lot of you own Berkshire Hathaway stock. So I gave some uh thoughts on how I&#39;m thinking about that and you can listen in here. Open for business on CNA 938. Bshire Haway held its annual shareholder meeting in Omaha, Nebraska and its CEO Warren Buffett picked the very final minute of that gathering to drop a bombshell. The Oracle of Omaha is stepping down. Well, it was an anticipated announcement from the 94 year old. He is 94. Uh but the news still came as a surprise to shareholders who were present and even to his own handpicked successor, Greg Ael. Uh he&#39;s not only the savviest investor of our time, Mr. Buffett, but he also built Burkshshire Hathaway from a failing business into a trillionoll company today. Mhm. Under him, Burkshshire&#39;s annualized shareholder return has roughly doubled that of the S&amp;P 500. Now, the company has close to 200 businesses, including Geico Car Insurance, the BNSF Railroad, Industrial and Chemical Companies, utilities, and even the Dairy Queen ice cream. So, what will Burkshire Heatherway look like without Warren Buffett? Well, let&#39;s get the thoughts of Thomas Hayes, chairman and managing member at Great Hill Capital. Uh Thomas, thank you for setting aside time to speak with us uh this morning on Open for Business. We have to ask you first uh did announcement come as a shock to you even though we all knew he&#39;d stepped down at some point. Yeah, we just didn&#39;t think he would be stepping down vertically. We thought it would be when he was horizontal. So, uh I think it was uh quite a bit of a surprise for everyone. uh absolutely the greatest investor in the world of all time and to your point uh 5.5 million% return since 1965 versus the S&amp;P of 40,000 give or take in English that just means he did about 19.9% per year for 60 years and the S&amp;P did 10.4 4 and it was less the great decisions that he made than the big problems he avoided. You know, I remember the covers of Forbes and other magazines in 1999 and 2000 when they all asked, &quot;Did Warren Buffett lose his touch because he wasn&#39;t investing in tech stocks and he was buying all these value stocks and these boring companies.&quot; Uh and then the next uh couple of years came when the NASDAQ fell some 80 90% and Buffett was uh up up for the next 3 four years and uh laughing all the way to the bank. But that&#39;s that&#39;s Warren and he never took victory laps. He he just let his actions speak for themselves. So obviously you&#39;re a big big fan of Warren Buffett. I mean no surprises there. I am as well. How did you react though when he announced Greg Ael as his successor? Well, listen, Greg is an incredible business operator, but you know, it&#39;s kind of like uh Taylor Swift and her band. When Taylor steps steps down, how many people are going to show up to watch the band? I mean, he&#39;s built an incredible conglomerate. It&#39;s a uh very solid, rockolid business. But without Warren, it kind of loses that magic touch. And uh I would estimate on a go forward basis you&#39;re you&#39;re effectively got a compilation of businesses uh like Haranto was referring to 180 some businesses it kind of represents the S&amp;P 500. Uh unless you saw some transformative or see some transformative deal to sop up some of that $350 billion of cash before he passes. Um once he does pass, I think there&#39;s going to be a lot of uh noise to start to issue dividends, to break up the company, some of the parts. They won&#39;t do that because he&#39;s probably taken every possible action he can to prevent them from doing that. But uh but that&#39;s that&#39;s really going to be the story. And uh without the Apple investment um you know the performance last 20 years cuz a law of large numbers was a a lot more muted than obviously the first uh 40 years before that and that&#39;s just uh by nature you know $1.1 trillion business now $350 billion of cash. It&#39;s going to be much harder to move the needle and have that level of outperformance moving forward. And the one thing that no one&#39;s been talking about this weekend uh Andreanne Haranto is uh one of the huge money makers besides Warren&#39;s stock and business picking ability was Ajit&#39;s underwriting ability and uh Ajet is getting up there in age and uh we you know he was responsible for creating all that free investment float from the insurance premium uh and he will be very very very difficult to replicate as well. I mean, but Buffett had joked over the years, if you have a choice, uh, you know, kind of if there&#39;s a safety raft on a boat and you and one person can fit, make sure you put a Jeep in the raft and leave me on the sinking ship because a Jeep has been a major major money maker over the decade. Thomas, Burkshire without Buffett is a theme that&#39;s going around because that&#39;s just how synonymous the two are. Some investors, they worry about the future of the company without the Buffett magic through Greg uh Ael. What will Burkshire&#39;s board as well as Mr. Buffett and Mr. Ael need to do to I suppose convince investors that the company is in safe hands? Well, look, I I think Greg Ael is a competent operator. Todd and Ted at the investment wheel. Um we, you know, he we didn&#39;t really get a they weren&#39;t brought out um to the forefront as much. So I I think investors don&#39;t really know what to think of their investment ability. Obviously Buffett Buffett has huge confidence in them or they wouldn&#39;t be in that position and they wouldn&#39;t have continued in that position and they&#39;re very smart investors. But the Buffett magic touch is a whole different story. And I think in order to move the needle beyond basically being a proxy for the S&amp;P 500 post Buffett, uh a a real transformative business deal needs to be done before Buffett passes. And and you look at the ones that they&#39;ve done in the past, uh whether it was um uh Mid-Americ Energy in 2000, they paid $2 billion. That was that&#39;s where they got Greg Ael from. uh or Burlington Northern Santa Fe Railroad in 2010. He bought that for 26 billion. Uh they really need a needle mover uh to kind of give investors the idea that this can continue to have outperformance because that 2% outperformance for the last decades which is very impressive uh was largely attributed to the investment in Apple. Um so they&#39;re they&#39;re they&#39;re really going to need something like that. Otherwise, you just have to accept it&#39;s a $1.1 trillion company. Hard to grow at 20% a year at that level. Uh and just um effectively, you know, take a choice whether it&#39;s the S&amp;P or uh Bergkshire, you&#39;re probably going to get similar type of returns over the next decade. Well, Buffett seems to think that Ables has what it takes to uh get there or even take Berkshire Health away even beyond that. But the thing is he&#39;s also inheriting the company at a really tough time in American uh in the American economy so to speak with Mr. Trump and his tariff policies among many other things that are weighing on Americans right now. How will his challenges differ from that of Warren Buffett&#39;s say? I mean it&#39;s it&#39;s hard to beat like you say 60 years of returns at 20% or more. I mean, it&#39;s it&#39;s going to be a tough call for Mr. Ael given the current environment he&#39;s in. Do you think? Well, look, I mean, if your boss set you up with $350 billion of cash, you&#39;d have to work really hard to screw it up. Uh, I mean, uh, he&#39;s got an awful lot of cushion and a lot awful lot of optionality to make good things happen. And I think he&#39;s certainly a competent operator as it relates to tough times in the US. I think that&#39;s a very difficult statement to justify based on the numbers presently. You know, we just came off earnings season. We had 12.8% earnings growth. The negative GDP headline that people are referencing was a lot of pull forward from uh imports. You know, C plus I plus G plus X X being net exports. Um that that took off about 3 percentage points. So barring that pull forward where we basically had 3% economic growth. Uh now if if we go another 2 3 months with no reasonable trade deals then we then we could potentially have a problem. And honestly given Bergkshire&#39;s cash position that would be the best thing ever that could happen to Bergkshire. But I I really don&#39;t foresee it happening that uh we what we&#39;ve seen so far is we have a Trump put. They&#39;ve they&#39;ve shown flexibility to pause. uh they&#39;ve shown flexibility with different industries, the auto industry to do certain carveouts for the auto suppliers uh and and the rigidity that started with quote unquote liberation day has kind of ameliated. So that&#39;s given the market some level of comfort. Earnings guidance while it&#39;s come down about 3.6% 6% for 2025. It&#39;s held in for 2026 at $32 on the S&amp;P, which implies we&#39;re trading at about 18.5 times next year&#39;s earnings compared to the 10-year average of 18.3 times. So, the economy is generally strong, which is kind of their problem. Uh, unless things get really bad, they&#39;re going to have a hard time finding a big enough business to buy to move the needle at good prices. And that that&#39;s been the problem for a long time. Much easier to find smaller subscale businesses when you&#39;re running 10 or 20 or 30 billion than when you got uh a $1.1 trillion company. So the days of uh the little one-offs like Seas Candy and Dairy Queen and uh the gas stations and Hellsburg Diamonds and Omaha Furniture Mart uh are behind them. They really need something big. and uh and you know there it&#39;s it&#39;s hard to say that that&#39;s in the immediate future. Yeah, he&#39;s got uh not just big shoes to fill but a pretty challenging front to tackle as well. Uh Thomas, we&#39;ll leave it there. Uh it&#39;s the end of an era, start of a new one hopefully for Burkshire Hathaway. Thomas, uh it&#39;s been great to have you uh to chat with us this morning. Really appreciate it and surely not going to be our last one with you. Thank you very much Andrea. I appreciate it. And Haranto as well. That&#39;s Thomas Hayes. He&#39;s chairman and managing member at Grit Hill Capital. And we&#39;re back. And then finally, this one was all the way last Thursday uh when we And to break down these results, we have Thomas Hayes, chairman and managing member at Great Hill Capital. Thomas, thanks for your time today. So, let&#39;s start with Microsoft because the initial concern was that there was a slowdown when it came to data center leases, but that&#39;s not what we saw. We&#39;re seeing increased spending. in fact increased demand for its cloud division. Uh does this put concerns of overspending, overinvestment and even slowing AI demand behind us? Well, they absolutely crushed earnings, Sarah, and to your point, they raised revenue guidance by $1.25 billion. They&#39;re expecting Azure growth, the cloud growth of 34 to 35% after hitting 33% this quarter. So all the concerns and all the rumors about leases being cancelled etc were in vain. Uh revenues were up 13% versus 8% expectations. Earnings were up 18% versus 10% expectations and guidance was strong. So this is in line with what we&#39;re seeing so far in earnings season which is earnings are up 10.1%. And that&#39;s why when we saw the Atlanta GDP now had been predicting -2.7% GDP, we thought it was a little bit uh ridiculous. I mean GDP did come in at.3% but as you referenced Sarah that was uh uh mostly due to inventory building ahead of tariffs. X that inventory building, we would have had positive GDP growth of about 3%. Yeah, we&#39;ll we&#39;ll get to the GDP more in a bit, but I want to get to Meta as well because they posted strong advertising revenue and and that&#39;s despite concerns over tariffs and and what these tariffs can do when it comes to corporate spending. Uh what does that earnings results tell us about the potential drag uh that that tariff uncertainty and volatility would have on the corporate sector? Yeah, well the ad revenue was the big question mark. People were a little worried about consumer sentiment etc. came in 41.3 billion of revenue versus 40.4 billion estimated unlike Microsoft which which raised revenue guidance. uh Meta&#39;s guidance was in line with expectations and some of that is due to the fact that 10% of their ad revenue comes from Chinese sellers in the US and that&#39;s probably going to uh go away a little bit in the second quarter. So they had to take that guidance down but overall very solid very solid on the daily active users 3.43 billion versus 3.39 billion estimates. So all in all I mean earnings 6.43 43 versus $524 estimate. Revenues 42.3 billion versus 41.4. Uh really really good and alleviated a lot of fears in the market and I think you&#39;re going to see some follow-through with this positivity after market. Yeah. And we briefly talked about GDP. They&#39;re shrinking for the first quarter and they&#39;re not concerns about stagflation. Of course, uh President Trump blaming it on his predecessor. Some analysts are are attributing this to front loing. Uh but what do you think about about the numbers and what does this tell us about the path ahead for the US economy? Well, I think the negative is a positive in the sense that it brings in three puts on the market. Number one, you have the Trump put. Uh on April 8th, he said, &quot;Now&#39;s the time to buy the market.&quot; That was the bottom of the market that day. Today, he came out and said, &quot;Be patient. America will boom. So, you know, Trump is now watching the markets. Then you have these three numbers that were weak today. The GDP was weak, the ADP job numbers, 62K versus 120K was weak. And inflation came in the lowest since November. The PCE prices uh at 2.3%. So, those three things bring back in the Fed put and we&#39;re now pricing in about a 65% chance of a cut in June. And then the final put was the Treasury came out with an announcement that they&#39;re looking to enhance their Treasury buyback program to lower long-term lending costs, i.e. bring down the yield on the long end of the Treasury curve. And that is very very constructive for the economy. So, what&#39;s bad is good. Uh our earnings have been very very solid. Guidance has been pretty good. These economic numbers bring the Fed back into play and the most important thing will be the jobs report on Friday to see how that labor&#39;s market labor market is doing and how quickly the Fed is going to step in. Yeah. So now it sounds like you are waiting for more support from from the Fed and the Treasury. Thomas, will that be enough though to carry the US markets higher forward? Even with this backdrop of uncertainty and volatility, how much room do you think Wall Street can go higher from here? Okay, so what we had on April 8th and April 9th was record selling at the lowest point when the market was down 19% by hedge funds and CTAs. What&#39;s basically happened is they are now we&#39;ve had this rebound about halfway rebound they are praying for a retest of those lows and praying rarely works when it comes to investing. So, as the market pushes higher, maybe it&#39;s going to be uh more earnings, but I think it&#39;s going to be deal announcements, trade deal announcements. All of these people that got short at the exact wrong time are going to be forced buyers in coming weeks as we get deal announcements. And that&#39;s going to probably be the surprise of coming weeks is that while everyone&#39;s skeptical and some of the the economic numbers are slowing a bit is that you have forced buyers who basically sold at the exact wrong time that are going to have to get in and chase once we get some positive news across the tape as it relates to trade deals. Yeah, and we&#39;ll watch that closely when it happens. Thomas, appreciate you. Now, this is today Thomas Hayes there, chairman and managing member at Great Tail Capital. talking about earnings, but the most important part of this, even if you want to fast forward, is the last minute and a half when I was talking about forced buyers. And that proved to be really preient, especially considering what happened today. So, listen in here. And we&#39;re back. And on that one, just want to thank Audrey Tay and Sarah Ali for having me on that. Reuters, I want to thank uh them for including me in their article here last week about the stock market. And then on to our quotes of the week, we had uh Warren Buffett here. You do things when the opportunities come along. I&#39;ve had periods in my life when I&#39;ve had a bundle of ideas come along and I&#39;ve had long dry spells. If I get an idea next week, I&#39;ll do something. If not, I won&#39;t do a damn thing. And this is what Buffett calls the no strikes rule. You can stand at the plate. In baseball, they call strikes if you stand there and do nothing. Uh in investing, they can throw it down the middle. You don&#39;t have to swing. you can wait till the very fattest knuckle ball that you can knock out of the park. And that&#39;s what we try to do here. And we learned that from the master himself, a hero to me, Warren Buffett. Seth Clarman. Value investing requires a great deal of hard work, unusually strict discipline, and a long-term investment horizon. Few are willing and able to devote sufficient time and effort to become value investors, and only a fraction of those have the proper mindset to succeed. That&#39;s from Seth Clarin. Uh, you know, it&#39;s interesting. People are asking me like, &quot;Wow, you must be so excited about Cooper Standard.&quot; I got to be honest with you, uh, I was more excited about Cooper Standard when I was buying it in the low fives in May of 2022 than I am today because I knew that what you&#39;re seeing today was going to be happening whether it took 2 years, 3 years, four years, 5 years. So yes, it&#39;s a five bagger off our initial basis. So far, we believe it&#39;s just getting started. It&#39;s only crediting at this stage. It&#39;s giving you credit for, you know, under $2 of earnings. Uh uh getting ahead of itself. We think that if the execution goes right and what we heard about the tariffs and everything else, uh, not only can it match what it did in 2017 earning $7.19 a share, but we also think that um because of all the costs that they&#39;ve taken out of the business that it could potentially earn more this cycle. So, there&#39;s a lot of gas in the tank. uh you know, you can you can manage your position as it continues to go up. But um it for me honestly the red days when I got to buy more were far more exciting than seeing happen what we knew was going to happen before we entered the position and uh and more good things to come. So uh very grateful for that. Next, my idea of a great business is one that has a shortage of competitors. Peter Lynch, you know that that&#39;s what everyone was worried about with the tariffs. I&#39;m like, who&#39;s going to stand up the billion dollar factory to replace Cooper Standard if they get destroyed because of tariffs? Like, think about this, guys. It&#39;s about share. Everyone&#39;s going to have to deal with the same set of conditions and the underlying demand for the cars is not going to change 13 years, etc., etc. We&#39;ve covered it all. Um, moving along, let&#39;s go through some data and charts. We&#39;ve got a ton of them this week. Uh, first off, customer consumer balance sheet. Um you can see that uh by the way this was uh this is from one of the major banks through Seth Golden posted it on his website on his Twitter. Uh you can see all the assets that the consumer balance sheet has 190 trillion uh versus the liabilities at 20 trillion. So you can see that they are very very well capitalized and this this creates a lot of space as Bessant gets the 10-year yield down and people can start to draw on that equity home equity lines again. Uh you&#39;re going to see massive massive consumer opportunities with cars, with houses, with everything else. Uh average S&amp;P stock trades at an extreme discount to the cap weighted S&amp;P 500 index. Uh, all this says in English is there&#39;s so much to do right here. Yes, a lot of our stocks have taken off. Look, I I love Boeing. Boeing&#39;s up 50% in a couple of weeks and no one&#39;s paying attention. Those are the best movers when no one&#39;s paying attention after it&#39;s moved so much because it got so hated and forgotten. I mean, I was pounding the table on Varnney for weeks. Disney, same thing. They just beat it&#39;s starting to fly again. Um, these are the best ones when they fly and no one cares about it. Uh, and we&#39;re seeing more and more of that. So, um, so that&#39;s that. Uh, here is the Quen model versus Open AAI, Deep Seek, Gro 3, Gemini 2.5, Open AI, all the versions. And you can see that uh, Quen, Alibaba&#39;s AI models blow the doors off. Open AI, Deepseek, Grock, and Gemini on every single metric. It&#39;s not even a competition. It&#39;s like putting up a McLaren against a Miata. It&#39;s like no one even needs to go to the race. You know what the outcome&#39;s going to be. Average home and I continue to say cheapest AI play in the world. Uh to reiterate, as we have for the last eight consecutive weeks, we now own 100% of our stock in Hong Kong, ticker 9988. uh not because we think the the administration is going to torch $800 billion dollars of investment capital. That would be far too stupid for any rational administration to do. Uh but just in case just in case uh it happens, we&#39;re covered. We still have derivative exposure in the US and we&#39;re 100 willing% willing to uh take 100% of that risk because we can&#39;t replicate it. and uh any derivative position we go into, we&#39;re willing to take that because the expected value is so high and it&#39;s positioned accordingly etc. So there&#39;s still risk on the derivative side. We can live with that anyway because the equities will uh appreciate well more to compensate. So uh and we don&#39;t we think again it&#39;s a low probability. We go through this song and dance every two years. Average home builder incentive as a percentage of sales price. Just like cars, as incentives go up, so do volumes. The same thing is happening. Biggest four-week VIX declines and forward S&amp;P 500 returns. So, you can see we&#39;ve had a huge uh VIX crush, which we talked about a few weeks ago on Vanney. And you can see the average return going out. One year is 16%, 3 years is 46, 5 years is 85, etc. 20 worst shipping quarters. We just had one in Q1. That should start to free up as more of these deals get announced. Like the UK deal today, share of accounts making minimum credit card payments rising. So, we did acknowledge this in one of the interviews that you are seeing some pressure at the lower end, but you have to keep in mind people still have jobs. So, when consumers have jobs, they spend. Uh, and part of this is a function of rates. They got all this debt taken out in 2021 when rates were basically zero. So, you know, the banks are going to have to eat some of that. It&#39;s just the way it goes. Uh, United States international arrivals is tanking. That&#39;s tourism on the basis of what&#39;s happened. That will rebound very, very quickly as deals get signed. I can already see the the Brits getting on the airplane to come visit New York. Uh, so that&#39;s that. And as the dollar weakens, you are going to see an absolute unbelievable abundance of tourism in the United States. Uh as the dollar continues to weaken, US real personal consumption expenditures. Uh bad data is bad news. Dismal years for stocks. All right. So this is trying to make a bare case except it&#39;s already happened. So it&#39;s rearview mirror looking. dollar remains overvalued on a long-term valuation metrics. That is correct. We do believe the dollar is going to trend down for some time. Uh however, because everyone&#39;s getting bearish on the dollar now and you saw the covers of the economist and baronss etc. We do think you get a counter trend bounce in the short term uh just enough to uh force covering for the people who got short late. Hedge funds have gotten very short late after a huge move that once they get punished, it&#39;ll resume the downtrend and they cover. America&#39;s data center boom is largely being powered by gas and coal plants. That&#39;s why we have Commtock, which continues to rock and roll. I think it was up to $22 today. Uh we were pounding the table on this podcast at $89. Uh May is historically strong in a postelection year. uh uh kind of throw this out the window with this administration. Although it did sort of hold up with the exception of no, it didn&#39;t hold up. March and April were were down a lot. Uh and it should have been strong, but it was what it was. It&#39;s more than made up for it and will continue to do so. Data centers drive record surge in tech investment. Uh two-year trailing price returns. Uh Q2 Atlanta GDP now estimate is positive. So so far and that&#39;s probably why they&#39;re getting these deals done quickly and juicing the market because they don&#39;t want a negative wealth effect when people&#39;s portfolios go down they stop spending. If they keep the market up and people keep spending they won&#39;t get that second quarter of negative GDP growth which is a technical recession. So this is very critical that that stays positive. Um share of investment flows from mainland China into Hong Kong is growing very much in line with our original thesis. US fundamental long short uh ratio say so they are record short in the whole like we&#39;ve never seen. Um, and just as they were record long at the peak in 2021, which is why you&#39;re seeing all the forced buyers that we covered before the fact, both with CNA and with David Lynn. S&amp;P 500 versus Europe returns when US dollar is strong versus weak. Strong dollar, S&amp;P outperforms, weak dollar, everything else outperforms. That is the core of our thesis. That is what we&#39;ve been talking about for 6 months and that is why those of you who had listened outperformed everything in the first quarter with uh XUS 12 month housing price changes prior year versus most recent year. You can see the difference by region. Uh affordability is going up is the theme of that. China US exempt about a quarter of imports from tariffs. Estimated value of exemptions, US imports from China, China imports from US. So there&#39;s already some movement that already happened. We&#39;re obviously paying close attention to the talks in Geneva this weekend. Those will be crit critically important. You can see what&#39;s happened here just in the last few weeks. The percentage of S&amp;P 500 members above the 20-day moving average has skyrocketed weekly bound announce that&#39;s all the forced buyers that we warned were coming uh in a warned in a good way. Uh Q1 earning season has seen a huge surge in buyback announcements to record highs. That&#39;s going to also help earnings. Retail investors bought the dip in line with other major volatility episodes yet again. And what I&#39;ve said is proven correct is that since COVID, retail investors have been right. They&#39;ve been buying on weakness and institutional investors and hedge funds have been wrong. They&#39;ve been selling at the exact wrong time. Cashlike ETFs head for record inflow in April. There you go. That&#39;s all going to be forced back into the market just when we&#39;re at the next shortterm top. More good news for the bulls. Uh this is from Carson returns after recovering 50% of the bare market 1950 to current. 6 months later up 10% 12 months later up 18%. Home prices versus affordability. You can see the price index is at an the biggest extreme since 2006 2007. Uh, I think this is going to get solved pretty quickly and we&#39;re going to cover it in the article of the week and talk about why and how impact that&#39;s going to be a theme for us moving forward is the home building recovery impact of policy uncertainty on S&amp;P 500 cash use uh controlling for all other variables that was uh in the first quarter and then they&#39;ve and then they April reversals in the S&amp;P 500 was one of the biggest in history going back to 2001 which is a model that we&#39;ve used and co those were the only two bigger turnarounds in the month of April uh in the last 30 years and maybe maybe throughout history. US importers expect a double digit decline in import volume from May. Can&#39;t tell you how many clients have called me in the last week and said, &quot;Oh my god, I cannot believe how timely impression that special webinar you did for us was.&quot; It was literally a 35minute call for all my money management clients. Um, the day before Trump put out that now&#39;s the time to buy stocks. Actually, it was two days because if I remember, Trump put that out on Thursday and I put out the podcast, the the webinar for clients, maybe Monday or Tuesday night. Anyway, I just said to them, if you ever thinking about adding more money, now is the time. The last time I told you guys to do this was October 2022 and a little bit in March of 2023, but really pounded the table. I never come on and say this. And so many of them took me up on it and they&#39;re calling me up. They&#39;re like, I can&#39;t believe it. I was my I was shaken to do it and like here we are. It&#39;s just been I&#39;m so excited for them. Uh and uh and those who hung through, you know, I didn&#39;t get any phone calls of people saying, &quot;Oh, what&#39;s what&#39;s going on?&quot; I got a couple, but not like not it was more like, &quot;Should I add more money, blah, blah, blah, etc.&quot; and um and they and every single one just ju I just best amazing clients suck it through and now you&#39;re just beginning to see the rewards like yeah Cooper Sanders doing great Boba&#39;s coming back great great great and and you know comtock all these others and the the P&amp;Ls are are just unbelievable um uh on a relative basis to everyone else But if you look by company by company based on the fundamentals that they&#39;ve reported, it it&#39;s like we&#39;ve got 10 more Cooper standards in our portfolio that haven&#39;t even begun yet. It&#39;s just beyond exciting right now. Uh is what I can say. That doesn&#39;t mean we won&#39;t get a pullback now that everyone&#39;s excited because we&#39;ve been up, you know, 10 days in a row, but um it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s pretty cool. Sellside, equity sentiment fell, so that&#39;s good. Uh no signs of selling for US stocks. Good increase in crowded stocks would have underperformed by 5% peranom since 2009. This is basically saying if you crowd into the most crowded trades like mag 7 eventually catches up with you and erases all the outperformance that you had in previous periods. We&#39;ve been that was a big table pounder coming into this year. Get the hell out of MAG7 and that&#39;s proven to be preient. um long only funds exposure to cyclical and defensive sectors is near an all-time low. Uh that that what what does that mean? Uh consumer discretionary you think about uh VF corp you think about you know the Nikes of the world you think about materials at Albamar&#39;s industrials at Generax. Now, these things are going to get bid by the people who missed it. Uh are going to have to play catch-up. And we&#39;ve seen this game before, and it&#39;s just going to be violent to the upside for all the left behind stocks, which is exciting. Cash near low. Uh 67%. Okay, we&#39;ll cover earnings at the end. Earnings have been amazing this quarter and guidance a lot better than expected. Project delay mentions start to pick up, but still well below COVID levels. So that is understandable and that&#39;s the risk, the lagged effect of that. But I think now with this real concrete deal announced, people are going to say, &quot;We know what direction they&#39;re headed. We should probably invest while there&#39;s still some level of uncertainty so we can get a little bit of a discount in doing so.&quot; Consensus sees growth spread between the Magnificent 7 and other 493 narrowing. So again, you continue to see a res resurgence in the X-Mag 7 and a significant deceleration in earnings growth in the MAG 7. That was the core tenant to our thesis going into the year. Uh S&amp;P 500&#39;s longest winning streak since 2004. So one more thing pointing to the early 2000s, which has been key part of our theme for the last 6 months. Prime book global energy uh positive value equals net buying. So the world is pretty negative on energy stocks and I just am not at the point where it&#39;s a super fat other than what you know when we were buying com stock in the eights and nines and pounding the table on the podcast. There&#39;s nothing there that is just pound the table I can&#39;t get enough of easy double over three years. Um, and there are a few, but they&#39;re just not quality enough for me to want to risk capital there. So, I continue to pay attention to it. I think there&#39;s going to be a violent move. We will participate through uh com stock resources, but maybe maybe we&#39;ll get one more in before it goes. And maybe we won&#39;t. But, you know, it is what it is. Uh, I got to find something that&#39;s a slam dunk dunk where my downside is protected. And that&#39;s the problem with a lot of energy. Your downside&#39;s not protected under $50. And the uh upside&#39;s at least a double to to a triple over you know 2 3 4 years and I&#39;m just not finding that yet. So um sector fund flows you can see it there. Uh Buffett how he crushed it for decades performance against icon. So he basically had 19.9 you know 5 and a half million% returns. But what that worked out to on an annual basis uh is about 19.9% returns versus the S&amp;P which was whatever 10 12% so almost double the S&amp;P. Um and if you really have studied him and know it wasn&#39;t so much cuz 3% of his investment decisions actually move the needle. Uh which is amazing when you think about it. Um the biggest thing he did was avoid the mistakes. Okay? So he didn&#39;t play in the tech bubble in 2000 when everyone said has Buffett lost his touch, he has no tech exposure, etc. Um and um so so he avoided that and by avoiding those huge 80 and 90% draw downs nifty50 in the 70s tech wreck uh you know huge exposure to housing during the great financial crisis and by avoiding those mistakes is how he really got the dramatic outperformance over time. It wasn&#39;t because every decision he made was right because again a few percentage made up the bulk of his good decisions. So, uh, short interest very high on the Russell 2000. Do not give up on short caps. They&#39;re just starting to go. Uh, that&#39;s going to be a huge second half, uh, beneficiary, uh, that we will benefit from. Healthc care versus staples price. [Music] Uh, so you got healthcare versus staple revisions and then you got price. So healthc care is a space obviously we have Baxter we&#39;ve got uh biotech back basket XBI I think those are also going to be great back half plays uh many categories of retailer two months or less of inventory so you&#39;ll have some more restocking there Trump&#39;s first term public comments public comments on Fed policy led to modestly lower rates pricing okay interesting Business confidence and capital spending expectations have collapsed in the last two months. That&#39;s going to start to resurge in the next 4 to 8 weeks. Uh main street meter, that&#39;s US consumer confidence index divided by US labor employment rate. So you&#39;ve seen a little bit of drop off in that recently. So it&#39;s something to keep an eye on. Looks a little bit like 92. Looks a little bit by like 2003. Um and uh so so that&#39;s that we&#39;ve covered the difference between the hard data and the soft data. What people are saying is they&#39;re despondent. What people are doing is they&#39;re euphoric. They&#39;re spending and they&#39;re going out and they&#39;re partying like uh like there&#39;s no tomorrow. What they&#39;re talking about here is the average annualized forward one-year and three-year total returns 1955 to 2025 when sentiment gets this low into the bottom quintile. And your forward three-year average annual S&amp;P return total return is 14.3% per year when when sentiment gets this low and um forward one-year return is 17%. Okay, so you get a huge snapback when sentiment gets this low. Lot of bets on tariffs falling in China. That&#39;s pretty obvious. Trump talked about it today. Chart of the day. Where are the inventories? Retailers currently hold about 35 days of inventory, which is near the record low scene during COVID. So, they&#39;re going to have to rebuild those inventories. That&#39;s going to be a potential issue if we see the backups. But I don&#39;t think it&#39;ll be as hard to get back online quickly as it was during those periods. Uh it&#39;s just we need to see a little bit of progress this weekend in Geneva. That will be helpful. China cuts key rate reserve ratio to aid economy hit by tariffs. Cumulative US net trader flow. Uh you&#39;re seeing some a lot of selling in staples, a lot of buying in financials. That&#39;s in the last 20 days. Uh you could see here when I always joke about Comarmac, they delivered 13 planes last year. Um Boeing on the other hand is going to do 448 this year. Airbus is going to do over 600. Over the next between now and 2034, Boeing&#39;s going to deliver 6,200. Airbus 8,400. Comac 780. So the Chinese need Boeing like a diabetic needs insulin. S&amp;P 500 revenue from China is roughly four times the US trade deficit with China. This is a chart that the Chinese should probably bring to the table. Uh the S&amp;P 500 companies get 1 almost 1.2 2 trillion dollar of revenue from China. Uh the US trade deficit with China is only $295 billion. So something to keep in mind. Longest private client buying streak in our data history. This is from Bank of America. So uh again the retail investors came in and started buying stocks. Uh S&amp;P EPS versus the Fed EPS breath suggests that the Fed should be in cutting mode, not pausing. They are too restrictive. Let&#39;s see how things look between now and June. I think if the inflation number stays subdued, they are going to be cutting for sure in June. also have to watch the labor numbers. If they get one week report where the unemployment rate goes from 42 to 44, uh I think you&#39;ll definitely see a cut in June, which will be a Goldilocks type of scenario. Firsttime home buyers in age group 26 to 34 is 71%. Median age of US home buyers has gone up to 38. US dollar underperformed FX majors in the first 100 days. All the other major currencies were up. Uh euro up 10%, US dollar down 9%, British pound up 10%. That was a key theme we were pounding the table on in Q4. That has begun to play out. Four-year average and share buybacks versus the S&amp;P 500 got very, very negative early in the year. now has spiked positive. Retail buying of US doiciled EU ADRs and Europe focused ETFs is gone straight up. 30-year fixed mortgage rates versus purchase mortgage applications index. You can see how this resolves as rates come down, purchase mortgage applications go through the roof. We saw the exact same thing in 2020 through 2022. Uh and then going back a little bit to 2013. Stock buyback set to blow past 1 trillion for the first time this year. That&#39;s been in the last couple of weeks. That is a sign of confidence. That is a sea change. uh US trade deficit is in goods and services as of March 31st has gone to a record. That&#39;s what they&#39;re doing here. You can see the dollar versus the 10-year yield. 10-year yield should start to follow the dollar pretty aggressively down ex, you know, again, when the 10-year yield was knocking on the door for five, we said it&#39;s going below four before it goes above five. everyone was certain it was going above five. Uh I think we&#39;re going to see 375 at some point this year and that&#39;s going to give us a high fives in the 30-year fixed mortgage and that is going to be a housing laooa as Charlie Munger would reference. Okay, so we just went below from below the 200. This is from Yurian Timmer back above the 200 day moving average. Okay, so that&#39;s has some significance. Auction demand remains healthy for treasuries. Breath narrowed a little bit in April. Only 40% of stocks outperform the S&amp;P 500, down from 60% in March. So something to keep an eye on. And moving along, Trump hails UK trade framework as the first of many tariff deals and Lutnik was on this afternoon saying the same. Dozens rolling out in the next uh couple of months. Trump says substantive China talks could yield a tariff cut. Uh that&#39;s a about face from what was said yesterday. Uh China cuts key rate reserve ratio to aid economy hit by tariffs. Bessent working on clear rules for US investment in China. Uh let&#39;s see. US2 overhaul curbs on AI chip exports after industry backlash. Uh so that&#39;s positive. Alibaba&#39;s Quen 3 topples Deep Seek R1 as world&#39;s highest ranked open-source AI model. We covered that with the table. US China tariff pause reasonable to expect. Council says Alip Pay and WeChat Pay see booming inbound spending in China during Labor Day holiday. Uh preliminary data from the country&#39;s two dominant mobile payment apps show two to three times the spending from a year ago. Uh that is huge ladies and gentlemen. And speaking of which, Alibaba, if you remember, the tech crackdown started with the pulling of the Ant Financial IPO. Well, it looks like it&#39;s now going to go public in the next year. We own a third of that through our ownership in 9988, aka Alibaba. Chinese stocks look like an opportunity amid Trump&#39;s tariff chaos. You&#39;ll notice all the Baron&#39;s articles are being written by new authors. The lady who wrote 135 consecutive negative headlines about China is no longer uh I don&#39;t know if she&#39;s even with the company, but she&#39;s certainly not covering China anymore. Um, and I joked, uh, it was like having a Palestinian write articles about Israeli tech companies. It just didn&#39;t work. Uh, and, uh, so now we&#39;re getting more balanced, uh, opinion follows trend. Warren Buffett plans to step down as Bergkshire CEO at year end. We covered all of that. CEOs celebrate Warren Buffett as he calls close on a 5.5 million% run aka 19.9% a year compounded. Uh just absolute legend. Disney new theme park hot spot the Middle East. So this is was a big announcement this week in the UAE. US exports of natural gas liquids touch record high in April. That was part of our original comtock thesis and more of that&#39;s to come because that&#39;s going to be part of the EU trade negotiations. You take all of our natural gas, stop getting it from Russia. We will uh lower your tariffs to a more reasonable rate than our our opening offer. Hartnet over at Bank of America market now expecting Trump pivot to lower tar tariffs, lower rates, and lower taxes and lower regulation. by the way, and this is what we said uh in the middle of the chaos. Just watch. It&#39;s going to be one headline and then the focus is going to start to shift to growth, deregulation, tax cuts, etc. And we&#39;re going to be off to the races and you&#39;re going to missed it. And that&#39;s exactly what&#39;s starting to happen. US auto sales up 9.9% in April on rush demand, inventory decline, and price spikes concerns going forward. The big thing going forward is they&#39;re going to have to replenish all that inventory. Trump&#39;s auto tariff relief shields USCMCA auto parts from 25% tax. Um Jeff Edwards covered that in the Cooper Standard earnings call, which we&#39;ll touch on in the article of the week. Home builders are piling into discounts, piling on discounts as they struggle to entice buyers. Again, we want to be in the arms dealers, not the ones fighting the war. Both the home OEMs like PY, Dr. Horton, etc., and the car OEMs, Ford, GM, etc. They are all going to be producing massive volumes in a race to the bottom in margins. We want to benefit from from who are the players that are going to benefit from high volumes and not be affected by the OEM margins uh nearly as much and that is the uh building supply products like QXO, Brad Jacobs which we own and uh obviously the ancillary plays like Stanley Black &amp; Decker Generrack on the housing front and Cooper Standard on the auto front. Small cap stocks have suffered. It&#39;s time to be cautiously optimistic. Baron&#39;s greatest public business publication in history. Talking about advanced auto parts. So much for not a safe asset. Yields tumble after stellar 10-year Treasury auctions. Stops through on soaring direct demand. Okay, so the game is back on. Yields are going lower. Everything is falling into place. Venmo owned by PayPal obviously. And by the way, even PayPal starting to move now back over 70, gaining ground in payments as cash app struggles. I remember every single week when we initiated PayPal and then bought more in the high50s. Everyone was like, &quot;What about Block? Uh Cash App is so popular.&quot; I was like, &quot;It&#39;s a bag of you know what.&quot; Same thing I said about Pin Duo Duo. Uh and uh and that&#39;s now proving out in both cases. GXO secures 2.5 billion NHS logistics contract. So even GXO is starting to rebound. And now on to our article of the week. New homes, new rides, stock market and sentiment results. Covered all the media. Cooper Standard. We&#39;re going to touch on some of the key points here. Obviously, it&#39;s had a huge move, some 70% in the last four sessions. Um, but it&#39;s not a mistake. Okay, the stock was down, you know, 98% give or take when we bought it and uh or 95% and no, probably 97% actually 146 down to five. Uh and by the way, as brilliant as we were buying in the fives uh when we started the position, it went to 385 before it went before it&#39;s gone back up to 26 uh and started its recovery. But opin opinion follows trend but price follows fundamentals. Sooner or later uh the market is a weighing machine. In the short term it&#39;s a voting machine based on emotions. In the long term it&#39;s a weighing machine based on fundamentals. And the the stock price is not going up because you know a quote unquote short squeeze. That&#39;s part of it. They&#39;re the first buyers obviously. But it&#39;s going up because free cash flow is going up. Revenues are going up. their execution is going up, volumes are going up and uh and that&#39;s what you need to see. Adjusted Ibida went from 29 million last year to 58 million this year on effectively FX adjusted same revenues uh double the IBIDA. So they continue to execute negative 30 million uh loss last uh first quarter last year positive net income 3.5 million this year. Uh so you can see uh the huge impact of foreign exchange the variance here uh but the underlying business units is improving and the margins on each unit has dramatically improved both due to pricing both to execution both to cost cuts uh etc. So you can see there I think the most important thing here was number one they received a an award from Toyota and Toyota is a smart very small part of their business. Uh it looks like that&#39;s going to become a much larger part of the business and the reason that&#39;s important is because hybrids are the future and Toyota is very very good at hybrids. So, the fact that Toyota is awarding them with uh an amazing supplier excellence award shows that they&#39;re going to get a lot more new business awards from Toyota going forward. And Toyota is a leader in hybrids. And part of the reason they&#39;re a leader in hybrids is because when everyone else was following the herd into EVs, uh their CEO uh said it just doesn&#39;t make sense. and he held ground. They kicked him out and two years after he was out, everyone said, &quot;Oh, you were right.&quot; Uh, and uh, and they&#39;re just dominating. So, that&#39;s good to see that Cooper Standard&#39;s going to get a piece of that record liquidity that we&#39;ve seen in the last two years, $300 million between cash on hand of 140 and uh, as and um, and their lending facility of 160. All the industry is moving towards hybrid basically in the US and that&#39;s they get 80% more per unit on a hybrid than they do on an IC and they get 20% more on an EV than they do on an ICE. So as the things trend which was not in our original model and is not in the 2017 numbers. So when we talk about seven to10 dollars of earnings, that&#39;s really not accounting for what can happen if this mix continues to be positive, which is why um on the interview that I did with Jeff Edwards, he we emphasized variable contribution margin uh and he believes he can get to two times leverage uh from four and a half times even without a refinance. number one because of the execution and the cost cuts, but number two because the amount per car that they&#39;re making and going to continue to make as the mix shifts to more hybrids and EVs, but predominantly hybrids, further margin expansion. That&#39;s the story that he continues to pound the table on and he has for a year and a half as he promised to get back to double digit IBIDA margins, double digit return on invested capital and he is confident to deliver on that uh uh by the end of this year which is pretty exciting. It&#39;s always been a mñana story. Now it&#39;s a now story and the stock is starting to to reflect that. Uh CBS supplier of the year covered the Toyota increase hybrid consumption. We covered that. Ebida margins, we covered that. Uh management expects to mitigate or recover the vast majority of direct tariff impacts and does not view tariffs as significant cost headwing going forward. The vast majority of parts fall under the free trade umbrella, making tariffs much le less of a threat for Cooper Standard compared to other tier one suppliers. For the small amount that was paid, two about $2 million, management expects to be reimbursed by the OEMs. So far, management has seen no significant changes to Q2 compared to the original volume expectations with mix coming in more favorable due to higher truck and SUV production. Production schedules remain intact and with many OEMs offering favorable incentive plans like employee employee pricing through June, domestic inventories which were already 30% below historic averages continue to be depleted. Inventories will have to be replenished suggesting strong second half production outlook. Free cash flow was a net outflow of approximately 32 million in line with last year. However, Q1 has historically always been a working capital c outflow from a seasonality perspective. Cash and cash equivalents total 140 million, bringing total liquidity to 300 million. The EcoFlow switch pump recently won the Automotive News PACE pilot award, a key industry benchmark for emerging technologies management expects that as production of this technology ramps up and becomes fully commercialized, it will drive further profitable growth and expand the 80% cost per vehicle opportunity in hybrids even higher. This is key because it&#39;s a win-win. What they&#39;ve done with this EcoFlow switch pump is they&#39;ve reduced the amount of parts that the OEM needs. So, even though Cooper Standard is getting more money, um, the OEM is spending a less amount of money on that application. So effectively, Cooper Standards innovation has eliminated the need for them to buy ancillary parts from other suppliers. So they wind up spending less overall money, the OEMs, but they give all of that less money to Cooper Standard, which is more than Cooper Standard was getting to them before. So it&#39;s a win-win for Cooper Standard, a loss for the other less innovative suppliers, and we like them. They&#39;re hitting on all cylinders. Uh, Cooper Center continues to target a net leverage ratio of less than two times by the end of 2027, which would be less than half of the current 4.6. This target assumes normalized volume levels and most importantly does not factor in a global refi, which now is looking more and more likely uh sooner rather than later as the 10-year yield comes down. And I think that the minute you see the 10-year yield at 380 or 375, they&#39;re going to refinance the whole thing and probably take out 20 30 million of interest costs, which is basically, you know, a buck buck and a half uh of of earnings per share just on that. Uh Cooper Center was awarded 55 new million in new net business during the quarter. Capex as a percentage of sales during the quarter was 2.6, six well below average of four to 5% as management focuses on maximizing return on invested capital and maintaining capital discipline. Then you saw from Michael Ward at city auto manufacturers parts and equipment the demand picture is bright when the tariff fog clears well the fog is clearing so the the demand picture is bright. What they&#39;re talking about is all the things that we&#39;ve been talking about since May of 2022 when we initiated the position. Um, in the short term they&#39;re talking about the inventory levels which we covered. Then they&#39;re talking about demographics which was a core to our thesis. US vehicle fleet approaching 13 years replacement accelerates with age. By our estimates there are 140 million. 45 to 50% of the total population of vehicles registered in the US are more than 12 years old. The scrap rate for a vehicle over 12 years of age is 9 to 10% annually compared with a rate of under 1% for vehicles under 12 years. Scrappage of an older vehicle eventually leads to new vehicle sale. The new market is the only source of a used vehicle. The replacement cost of the oldest fleet on record by our estimates will result in a replacement demand of 12 to 14 million units annually over the next 3 to 5 years. Since the since 2000, the replacement rate of vehicle population has averaged 4.8% annually. The oldest fleet on record should keep the scrap rate elevated. At the low end, a 4% rate results in 12 million units of replacement demand, and the average rate of 4.8% leads to replacement levels of 14 million units annually. Millennials fuel growth in licensed drivers. Uh born between 81 and 96 is currently the largest US population demographic and the group has entered the prime age for home and vehicle ownership. Uh which are two of our key themes. Ladies and gentlemen, the percentage of people with a license to drive grows from about 85% of people in their 20s to 90% of the people in their 40s. 91% of the 35 to 44 age group have a driver license to drive in line with historical levels. percentage is likely to move higher over the next 5 to 10 years as the rest of the millennial generation moves into their 40s. Growth in drivers is expected uh growth in the number of drivers in the 2023 to 2027 period is expected to be the highest level in over 40 years. You can see here from trough back to peak which will be meaningfully higher than the 2017 17 peak which is mindboggling. Trend demand 16 to 18 million units annually. Ladies and gentlemen, everything magical about what we&#39;ve been our models have been built on is around 16.5 to 17. And if they go as high as 18, then we have underestimated what this stock can do over time. Um inventory levels low benefit from positive demographic trend. Production tailwind 2.6 [Music] million. Stronger than expected sales in the first half will leave inventory levels depleted leading to positive production comps for the second half into 2026. And the first one here is Cooper Standard. uh should be in good position for accelerating industry volume most disciplines cap more discipline capital spending 20% reduction in debt transferring val that value to the equity hello uh margin improvement completed headcount reductions 150 to 200 basis points to margin etc okay then you have the earnings call which we covered quite a bit of that uh uh incentives, liquidity, and then everything about the tariffs. So, you can read through this. I mean, this was really an amazing call. Uh but we&#39;ll be here all night. Then Stanley Black &amp; Decker, which is a play on the themes. This got absolute monkey hammered in April following the tariff announcements. This, ladies and gentlemen, it comes down to share. And if you zoom out on this one, it&#39;s exactly like what you saw in the early 2000s. You had this huge rally, correction, looked like it was recovering, a complete wipeout, which is where we are right now. complete wipeout and then a recovery almost all the way back up to new highs which would imply uh in this case a 10 it would imply a $180 stock. Okay. And I think that&#39;s conservative long-term but it&#39;s where we are now. So um we&#39;ve been buying more. That&#39;s all I can tell you. This is uh you know mana from heaven. You can see they&#39;ve taken almost $2 billion of costs out and we love this story uh perspectively and we&#39;ve got a very very low basis on this. Now look at what&#39;s happened here. Price cash flow has fully recovered. Price is actually lower than when cash flow was at its most negative. We love stories that playing these divergences are where fortunes are made. And uh when we get a fast ball down the middle like this, it&#39;s just we cannot resist. The the only issue with problems like this is just not exceeding our position weight sizing and um having unlimited capital and and that&#39;s what we want to uh take advantage of for our clients because this is our next Cooper Standard. I mean I look well let me not say that Cooper standard is a unique situation. It&#39;s, you know, Cooper is already up 5x from our initial basis. It&#39;s going to probably do at some point I think cons, you know, I I think it could do another 4x from here over time. That&#39;s, you know, if everything goes according to plan and, you know, you you&#39;ll you&#39;ll manage around it as it goes up obviously and you&#39;ll have a piece of it that if it goes to 200, you&#39;ll still be able to participate, but you&#39;re not going to, you know, risk every marble, uh, you know, going from 100 to 200. you got to, you know, pigs get slaughtered. Uh, so, so you manage and you take some profits on the way up, but I really think that can be special. So, Stanley, different story, more like a BABA, three bagger, four bagger type of thing from here, uh, is is amazing. Okay. Okay. And if you want more than a double triple, you you buy something like QXO uh where you&#39;re betting on the guy in uh the case of Brad Jacobs and you know that you tuck away for 5 to seven years and you wind up with a 78 bagger uh as well because he&#39;s doing what he does amazingly well. He&#39;s using uh public multiple arbitrage to buy small businesses and frag fragmented businesses now that he has his platform. And then he uses the public currency at the high multiple to buy the private fragmented bit business uh with a with a uh subpar multiple rinse repeat add technology take costs out increased EBID off free cash flow rinse and repeat and then he&#39;ll get 10 15% of the total industry uh with double digit IBIDA margin and have you know an $800 billion company. Um, so you know, or you can think about it or chase the latest shiny object hoping you can get the extra dollar and find a sucker to buy after you, hoping the whole thing trading at 100 times sales and making no money doesn&#39;t collapse and you&#39;re left holding the bag. Uh, so we we avoid those situations in the latter and we uh gravitate towards the situations in the former. Uh the key thing here is they&#39;ve uh taken out they&#39;re close to finishing the $2 billion of costs which I think we had done the math on previously. All I can tell you is the smallest amount of improvement in construction is going to be a hockey stick to earnings. And when you look at the demand that we just covered for cars, which also applies for housing formation and new housing, what you&#39;re going to see with Stanley is going to be phenomenal. Uh DeWalt is back to revenue growth. Some key points here. Margins came in at 30.4. Their target is 35. The last time they did 35% margin and earned 160 I think it I forget what their operating income was but it translated to 160 to $185. In other words, when they hit 35% margins, the earnings power, the last time they had that level of earnings power, um the stock was trading between $160 and $180 a share. Okay, that and that&#39;s assuming very limited growth. That&#39;s just assuming the margin expansion, steady state, etc. Um, the beauty of housing like auto suppliers is when they turn the amount of operating leverage is insane and you get these hockey sticks like, you know, it&#39;s like, oh, should I buy it at, you know, oh, I bought it at $75, it&#39;s $60. Like, it&#39;s it&#39;s a rounding. It makes no difference. It&#39;s It&#39;s a complete rounding error because when these things go, this is going to be 150, $180, $200 stock. And whether you bought it at $71 or $63, uh, or $81 makes literally zero difference. That what what would what would be problematic is if you bought it at 80 and you sold it at 60 and you wind up buying it at 150 because you&#39;re an idiot, okay? And you missed it. Okay? The key is if you bought it at 80 and it went to 60 and you didn&#39;t buy more and bring your basis down to 70, then you missed an opportunity. There&#39;s nothing I could do for you because you don&#39;t understand what you own. But if you actually do the work, and you know, I&#39;m not even asking you to do the hours upon hours of work uh that we&#39;re doing here and Jeff did a great job of of compiling all this uh for our weekly article. If all you do is you take the 30 minutes to actually read it and understand it, even if you don&#39;t listen to the hours of conference call, of competitors conference calls, of channel checks, of industry checks, even if you don&#39;t do any of that, even if you just read, you would know what you own. And and I think um some people make the mistake of an unwillingness to burden themselves with the facts because once you burden yourself with the facts, you&#39;re like, &quot;Holy things like this come around.&quot; Like I mean you know in the case of Stanley Black &amp; Decker you get an opportunity like this once every 10 to 15 years. Okay. Last time you had the opportunity was the great financial crisis. So 16 years ago before that it was nine years before that you had an opportunity to to to buy it at these levels of complete dislocation. But the fact of the matter DeWalt Stanley Craftsman these these have been around for decades generations upon generations have used them. Why? Because they&#39;re the best. They are the best brand. they&#39;ve got brand equity and when the underlying conditions which are perfectly set all we need is the 10 we&#39;re going to cover a lot of this at the money show by the way uh with the amount of federal land that they&#39;re going to open up uh with what&#39;s going to happen with rates with all the conditions that are going to be in place and the and the explicit demand these are better way to play it than the homebuilders which are going to be fighting margin wars against each other and having to produce more and more and more to keep their earn earnings going uh where the arms dealers were going to make the most money in the shortest spot of time with the Stanley&#39;s and with the Generracks and with the QXOs. So, you should go through this. We even highlighted the important parts in green so you can see what happens with tariffs and how a lot of the stuff&#39;s covered under US MCA. Very similar story to Cooper Standard. The only difference is Cooper started to move. It&#39;s up 5x. Stanley&#39;s going to start to move. It&#39;ll be a double probably a year from now. And then people will look back and say, &quot;I missed it.&quot; And they&#39;ll buy it up, you know, one and a half times. It&#39;ll correct 40%, they&#39;ll sell at the whole. And then at 180, 200, they&#39;ll be chasing up and that&#39;ll and it&#39;ll be over. Uh, and that&#39;s just the way it goes. Um, GenerRack, exact same story. Look what&#39;s happened to free cash flow. Look what&#39;s happened to price. Our prize is back to the levels it was when cash flow was completely negative. This thing is just getting started. This is a normal cyclical recovery for Generrack and the game is just starting. So, uh, yeah, we&#39;re way in here. So, I got a key points we&#39;ve covered in the past. CNI business starting to recover. That&#39;s good to see. Uh, so at the very least, go through the 10 key points. If you&#39;re not even willing to read that, go through that and you can see why we&#39;re so excited about these opportunities. And we spent the last four weeks just loading the boat every which way we could. Disney shot the lights out. We&#39;re going to cover that in more detail next week. Uh some sentiment is coming back into the market, but not extreme yet. So, there&#39;s more to do. Uh earnings NASDAQ top 30 weights in the last 60 days estimates went up by 1.1%. uh and for next year went up two basis points. Dow went down a little bit by 2.48% for this year, 2.65 for next year. Economic data um non-manufacturing PMI was in expansion came in better than expected. See if there&#39;s anything else here we need to know about. Continuing claims came in lower than expected. Initial jobless claims came in lower than expected. And there you go. And then earnings were expected to grow at 6% this quarter. They actually grew at 12.8% 8% with over 80% of the companies now recording. And look what happened to estimates, ladies and gentlemen. They stopped going down. They were down 3.6% at 265. They&#39;re now at 266 for this year and uh still 302 for next year. Okay, so the podcast is done. We&#39;re for those of you who love the ask me anything questions from the audience. We&#39;re going to cover at least five of them now. We&#39;ll cover as many as we can, but this one&#39;s running long. So, let&#39;s see here. Okay. Paul asks about advanced auto parts. He says, uh, third point took an active position and then they exited their position. Yeah. So, I would say two things about that. Number one, we never got in becau be because Third Point was involved and we would never get out because Third Point is involved. We get in and out because we do our own work. Uh we love what Shane Kelly has done. He&#39;s done everything that he said he was going to do. Delever by selling off Canada, shut off shut down the nonprofitable stores, cut all the losses, cut the costs, start the hub and spoke model in the areas that they are the leaders. And now that they&#39;ve done all the cleanup work, guess what they&#39;re doing? They&#39;re going to open up a hundred new stores over the next couple of years. That is not what you hear from a company that&#39;s going out of business that they&#39;re opening up a hundred new stores. So, um, so we&#39;re excited about that one. Thanks for sending that in, Robert, but it&#39;s irrelevant. I don&#39;t invest on the basis of what other people do. If they happen to invest after I invest, great. Happy to have them on board. It brings more attention to the name, but um, I could care less. I I underwrite each individual business as if I was buying the local bodega and I wanted to see their financial statements before I made an offer. York bourgeoa I suppose Yeah, you&#39;re just study the conference call. All the answers to your questions are there. You don&#39;t have to ask me. All you have to do is just read what what management tells you and verify and you&#39;re you&#39;re golden. But congratulations on buying more shares at 13. You&#39;re already up on a double. Uh Chris Williamson. Okay, look at Beckton Dickinson. Uh, okay. Yeah, I think there&#39;s going to be great opportunities with the medical device companies. Uh, but we&#39;re playing it through Baxter. I think BDX is okay though. BDX. What? Oh, I&#39;m not signed in. I&#39;m like, where is my All right, so BDX, let&#39;s take a look at this. Yeah, it&#39;s interesting. It it this one&#39;s complicated and and I I&#39;ve continued to look at this and I&#39;ve continued to do nothing. And honestly, some of it is just instinct and gut after a while. Um especially it it&#39;s never I never make an investment on instinct and gut but I will avoid an investment on instinct and gut because there&#39;s no penalty for avoiding an investment. There&#39;s there&#39;s predominantly a penalty for you know errors of omission versus commission. If you commit uh capital and you&#39;re wrong, you got a problem. If you pass on something and it works without you, it&#39;s it&#39;s fine because it&#39;s like which one of your other babies were you going to sell and etc. etc. that you&#39;ve done all the work on. Um, I mean, this has always kind of been a low quality business in terms of inability to compound capital that you give to it above what you could get for free. So, that&#39;s why I&#39;m not a huge fan of it. Um, balance sheet, it&#39;s probably okay. Let&#39;s see. 20 billion. Yeah, it seems a little bit leveraged. 18 billion, $2 billion of cash. That&#39;s probably a little bit of an issue. Um, I mean, I don&#39;t think they&#39;re not going to be bankrupt or anything like that, but it&#39;s a lot of leverage for that type of business. generating three billion of free cash flow. Um, this is a tough one. I mean, this stock has gone nowhere in almost a decade. So, you definitely need a catalyst of new management. I think it&#39;s early. I think you&#39;re generally right. I just think it&#39;s I think it&#39;s early. I think it&#39;s going to take a while because it broke a lot of institutional money that thought this was safe and it&#39;s going to take a while to build a new level of sponsorship probably around the 150s and 140s and it may take two three years for them to kind of turn this. So for me it&#39;s a pass. I mean you could get a quick recovery but I I it&#39;s just not obvious to me. So I&#39;m going to pass. Uh ever looked at B&amp;G Foods? Uh yeah, we&#39;ve had it on a couple times and we passed and I think it went a lot lower. Let me just see. B G P and G G I can&#39;t even find the ticker. Try uh BGS. Okay. If you&#39;re buying it for the dividend, don&#39;t waste your time. Um, So sales have done nothing in five years. Are they buying in shares? No, they&#39;re issuing shares. So their sales are not growing and they&#39;re issuing equity at record low valuations. That is a no no for me. That is like Wall of shame. Executive action. Free cash flow is 100 million. What&#39;s their balance sheet look like? 50 million. And what&#39;s the debt? 2 billion. Ah, this thing&#39;s it&#39;s priced for bankruptcy. I don&#39;t know that it will go bankrupt. It might recover. Then you&#39;re going to get huge equity leverage. But uh I want to hear the turnaround plan. For me, it&#39;s down for a reason. It could definitely be a trade. I don&#39;t I don&#39;t like the story. Uh David Gavin asked me about like, you know, favorite investments of all time. I mean, a lot of them have been um it&#39;s not just the equity being up multibags, it&#39;s whether it&#39;s, you know, Range Resources, Rolls-Royce, a bunch of the others. I would say in many cases it was the option expression that got 10 bagger plus on top of the multibagger equity where we made huge amounts of money. Um so it&#39;s it&#39;s structuring those and taking advantage of how we do that for our clients. Uh LL from a good friend first initial J. You know who you are. Let&#39;s see here. This is a casino play. Stocks down 2/3 lll. These are tough. Usually what I do with casinos. It&#39;s like win or Las Vegas Sands when they&#39;re down. So this is negative free cash flow. Their revenues are growing. Uh they&#39;re building a new casino. It hasn&#39;t turned positive free cash flow yet. It seems like it&#39;s trending in the right direction. Let&#39;s see what the balance sheet looks like. I think they just built a new casino in Colorado if I remember. So they got 40 million of cash and they got half a billion dollars of debt. That&#39;s cutting it close, boys. [Music] Um it&#39;s never really compounded capital for owners. Let&#39;s see what their free cash flow looks like on that $2 billion of debt. Negative free cash flow last three years. So, you know, I think they did a Hail Mary pass here on the new casino. And if it works, it could work. Um, what are they doing to [Music] shares? Increasing the amount of shares. This is not this is not the kind of thing I like to touch. And the other thing is this has a history of being a disaster. Like they&#39;ve never created wealth for their owners in three decades. So it sounds to me like they&#39;re operating subpar assets. Maybe this new one will be their saving grace and it&#39;s the Hail Mary that works. But if the asset structure and the management company haven&#39;t been able to generate any wealth for their owners in three decades, I it&#39;s probably safe to say that they will continue to destroy wealth uh in the form of opportunity co cost for the next few decades. So for this one, I&#39;m a pass. I do hope it works, but I&#39;m not going to be involved. Uh Johannis, hi Tom, big fan of the podcast. been listening. I was wondering what you think about Whirlpool uh play on the housing market comeback. I like it. Uh we&#39;ve covered it before. We haven&#39;t done anything and um I think now&#39;s the time. Uh let me just double check. I think there were some yellow flags when we last looked at it, but I think you&#39;re on the right track. So cash flow is just starting to inflct. Revenues have collapsed. I think that was a worry for us. We wanted to understand the turnaround plan and we haven&#39;t gotten any comfort. Let&#39;s just see if they&#39;ve got enough runway to figure out their turnaround plan. I mean, this is a big drop in earnings. 20 uh in revenues. 25% drop in revenues. What are they doing to the share count? They&#39;re taking it down a little bit. That&#39;s good. cash flow. They paid back some debt, repurchased some stock, free cash flow positive, although moving in the wrong direction, 1.2 billion of cash, 4 billion of debt. I kind of like this one. You know, it it definitely warrants doing the work on it. Uh you put a gun to my head, I would buy it. So, um but there&#39;s not a gun to my head, so I don&#39;t have to buy it. Philip Andro Pinkos, Interfor Corporation, Lumber Producer. I don&#39;t I generally don&#39;t do commodity plays in equities because I got to win on two bets, the price of the commodity and management&#39;s operations operational discipline and excellence. Um, with the exception of energy companies from time to time, but let&#39;s take a look at it for for fun here. IFP All right. So, you&#39;ve you know the price has come down along with the cash flow and the revenues and the margins. Okay. So, your bet is that lumber prices are recovering. I mean, I guess it&#39;s a backdoor play on housing as well. Let&#39;s see if you got enough runway to see it through. Got 30 million of cash down from 400. $600 million of debt. You got a problem, Cowboy. I just don&#39;t I think you&#39;re right that it&#39;s going to rebound. The question is whether you&#39;re going to be around to benefit from it. Um I think you got to do a lot of work on this. I think it&#39;s interesting, but I think you&#39;re on a knife&#39;s edge there. But um so you got to understand when does the debt mature, what is the interest rate? Is it expected to go up or down? And then do a sensitivity analysis based on every commodity price for lumber. It&#39;s a lot of work. For me, that goes in the two hard pile. I think you&#39;re going to be right though. Eric C is wondering if you have any thoughts on UPS. We covered that one a few weeks ago. We like it, but we like it at lower levels was the short answer. Let&#39;s see. Oh, it got to lower levels. So, uh I think it&#39;s interesting, but it&#39;s it&#39;s a broken stock, so it&#39;s going to take a couple years to build a base. I think you&#39;re going to have time to get into it. It&#39;ll probably rebound quickly now and then go back down and languish there for a while. I don&#39;t I I I think you&#39;re right. I mean, if I can get it at 70 or 80, then I can then I&#39;m willing to wait three years with it being dead money because when it recovers, it&#39;s going to be, you know, double or triple. But I just think it&#39;s early. It&#39;s broken. They destroyed a ton of institutional holders and it&#39;s going to take an awful long time to rebuild trust and rebuild a shareholder base. So, for that reason, I&#39;m going to pass even though I think you&#39;re right. Let me just quickly look at some of the financials here. 20 billion of debt on six. Let&#39;s see what they&#39;ve done to the share account. Yeah, I I like it. I like the idea. I like the story. I like it all. I think it&#39;s gonna take longer than you think to recover, but I think it&#39;s definitely going to recover. So, it&#39;s a good idea and I&#39;m not going to participate, but I&#39;m going to keep a strong eye. Like, it could easily go from 95 back to 150 and I&#39;ll just be happy. I&#39;m just not involved. It&#39;s okay. But if it if it did if it did move down to 70, which I highly doubt, I&#39;d be willing to buy it knowing it&#39;s going to be dead money for two years because my IRRa 3 to 5 years out would be high enough. It&#39;s not high enough from here for me to accept the possibility of dead money for two to three years while they rebuild a shareholder base. Um, would appreciate your opinion on buying Baba on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange. uh then you have FX risk etc. Look uh then you&#39;re making like three bets instead of one. So you&#39;re never going to have certainty on anything. We own the shares on Hong Kong. We own the derivatives on the US. We understand the risks. We fully could see uh the derivatives go to zero. I think the probability of that is sub 10% I think to be honest with you. But it&#39;s not nothing. I personally wouldn&#39;t take currency and company and country risk. Uh for me, I would just own it in Hong Kong, transfer your shares. But if you want to own it in Germany and take the currency risk, have at it. Uh, Matt Mitchell. GT G&amp;TX. The short answer is I won&#39;t be involved because I don&#39;t think I have at least a double upside. Uh, but I think you&#39;re probably right to buy some here. Um, a little worried about their margins continue to decline. What do they do here? description. Digital vision connected car dimmable glass and fire protection. Automatic dimming rear view mirrors. Automotive electronics and non-automatic dimming rear view. Yeah, this is not anything like Cooper Standard. Yeah, they happen to be an auto parts supplier, but that this is not like indispensable stuff. Um, let me just take a look at the financials. If you&#39;re going to be in a commodity business, you really want to be in a commodity business and be the leader. This Cash flow has been pretty steady. Balance she&#39;s pretty healthy. So, you just have to really understand their products. I I think what you&#39;ve got here is I think what you have here is a don&#39;t get fired from your job easy 50% over the next couple of years. It&#39;s not going to be a home run, but it&#39;s a good quality business at a good price. And as long as you understand the product and the competitive landscape, I think you found a winner. All right. That&#39;s that. But not a home run. It&#39;s like a single. I go for doubles and triples. That that&#39;s a s, you know, and every now and then home runs like Cooper, but um that&#39;s that&#39;s a single and it&#39;s it&#39;s probably a pretty sure single. Uh Saga, congratulations on Cooper Standard. Okay. Why? No. PLCE. Yeah, this thing is a chronic bag of crap. So, let&#39;s see. Mythac Capital purchase 50% financial support loans over total. Yeah, I don&#39;t think this business is a good business. Let me just take a look at the financials. I mean, their revenues are collap. So, so this guy that&#39;s involved or whoever the hell he is is probably doing some type of real estate play like all the people that got bagged in Macy&#39;s. I don&#39;t think this thing turns. Um, there are no signs of it unless they got some miracle turnaround plan, but I don&#39;t I don&#39;t know that this is the type of business that has to go through bankruptcy, wipe out the debt, and then maybe the brand is worth something. 166 million. I mean, it&#39;s not a huge amount of debt, but relative to their $5 million of cash, it is. Uh, I understand why you want to do this, cuz if they actually fix it, the thing goes from five bucks to 50 bucks pretty quickly. Children&#39;s specialty portfolio. Children&#39;s clothes. I don&#39;t think so. I&#39;ve seen too many of these specialty retailer businesses like Chico and all that stuff go bankrupt. Uh yeah, so they&#39;ve got a new sugar daddy for a little while, but those guys usually get wiped too. I I would pass. Ultimately, what&#39;s going to happen is those debt financeers are going to own the whole business at the end of the day and wipe out everyone subordinate to them uh including the equity. Eric F uh uh asking about what should he do with Birkshire. We covered that in the uh 10 minutes with uh CNA. Uh he&#39;s talking about investing with Great Hill Capital versus just buying Berkshire. Uh look, I have 100% of my net worth in in Great Hill. Uh I think, you know, based on what I said with number one, the law of large numbers. Number two, with Buffett kind of being out of the picture, uh I think basically owning Bergkshire is going to be like owning the S&amp;P 500. So, um you know, talk is cheap. I put my money where my mouth is and I&#39;ll leave it at that. Uh Dylan K. Uh I think we&#39;ve we&#39;ve covered that multiple times before. Leaf Foster, what do you think about Pterodine? It&#39;s a great company. Let&#39;s just see if it&#39;s the right time. This is not a fat pitch for me. I like your thought process, but I just I don&#39;t think I&#39;m getting compensated enough for the risk. If I&#39;m going to take risk, let me take some real risk. let me own Intel where my downside is pretty much protected and if they fail I come out flat and if they succeed I get a quick double and if they really succeed and execute like I think they can with Lip Boutan I wind up with a four to five bagger. Um that&#39;s where I want to take my risk. I don&#39;t want my risk in this like if I win I&#39;m up 50% and if I&#39;m lose I&#39;m down 100 like that I&#39;m not willing to accept. So, um, cuz I have to size it in accordance and it just doesn&#39;t this is not a triple in the next 3 years. So, and it&#39;s probably not even a double. So, for that reason, um, as much as I love the I think the business is a good business, I just don&#39;t think there&#39;s enough juice in it for me to risk a dollar of capital, even though it probably goes up, not down. Uh, let&#39;s see here. I mean, it definitely has the runway, so you just have to get comfortable with the turnaround plan. This this is not where I want to play. I I I think you&#39;re right. I I just It&#39;s a pass for me. But good question. And with that said, we&#39;re done. We covered all of our questions. We&#39;ll be back next week. Um maybe a day early from New York, maybe a day late from Florida, but we&#39;ll get it out to you next week for sure. I&#39;m sure we&#39;ll have a lot of great stuff to cover. So, with that said, um we&#39;ll be back next week. In the meantime, make it a great one. Bye for now. [Music] [Music] Heat. Heat. [Music] [Music]
