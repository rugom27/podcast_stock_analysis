[0.56s] Welcome to Hedge Fund Tips with Tom
[2.8s] Hayes. I&#39;m Tom Hayes and this is your
[5.359s] 290th videocast podcast for the week
[8.0s] ending May 8th, 2025. Got a lot of great
[10.96s] stuff to cover today, but as always,
[13.28s] family first. Let&#39;s get right down to
[15.2s] it. Uh this is Annabelle. We&#39;ll cover
[18.08s] both. Mimi played in the San Diego
[20.16s] County Cup this weekend and had some
[21.6s] rockstar goals. She plays pretty much
[23.359s] the entire game and sprints non-stop the
[25.199s] entire game. She only has one speed,
[27.039s] fifth gear. Uh they call her wild pony
[30.08s] because she flies down the pool and no
[31.519s] one can catch her and she plows through
[33.12s] defenders to score. Annabelle also
[34.96s] played in the San Diego County Cup and
[37.36s] balanced a swim meet in Irvine and the
[39.76s] Southern California swimming banquet in
[42.239s] Garden Grove where she received an award
[44.96s] for her national ranking. She currently
[47.2s] leads the country in number one rankings
[49.92s] for 10 and under girls. So
[52.12s] congratulations. They did a rockstar
[54.32s] job. That&#39;s the banquet. Ah, this is my
[58.559s] friend Jason Berlinger. Thank you so
[60.64s] much. That&#39;s the 18th hole of Big
[63.039s] Canyon. Again, want to thank you for
[64.879s] having me on. Jason&#39;s got an incredible
[67.119s] book of business at Morgan Stanley. So,
[69.52s] those of you who need, you know, loans
[72.159s] for financing, stock loans, estate
[75.439s] planning, he is a wealth manager and
[78.08s] does a great job. Feel free to reach out
[80.4s] and uh I can connect you. Uh this is
[83.52s] interesting. This was not far
[87.159s] from where I live. I was walking to get
[90.92s] dinner and look at the tires on this
[94.32s] bicycle. This is like a beach bicycle or
[96.6s] something. The tires say Vans. This is
[100.72s] I&#39;ve never seen that. I didn&#39;t know Vans
[102.4s] was now in the tire business. But uh one
[105.36s] more thing that is not priced into the
[107.84s] stock. I don&#39;t know how serious that is,
[110.159s] but I thought it was pretty cool. um
[113.2s] talked to the two kids that were working
[114.799s] in the store. They didn&#39;t know anything,
[116.159s] of course. Uh then I want to thank my
[118.32s] buddy Brad Schmidt for having me uh to
[121.84s] Pelican Hill. We played the South
[124.079s] Course, which was just absolutely
[125.6s] incredible. Brad does commercial real
[128.879s] estate. So, if you&#39;re a big company
[131.36s] looking to rent out commercial space, uh
[133.92s] or buy or sell or rent or lease or
[136.959s] anything in that space in Southern
[138.48s] California, this guy is a pro. and he
[140.4s] also does nationwide syndications, Utah,
[142.8s] that type of thing. Uh that&#39;s uh Eli,
[146.319s] Steve. We had an unbelievable time at
[148.319s] the scramble. We came in
[150.84s] -12 on the day. Um
[154.72s] uh dropped a few putts which was pretty
[156.879s] cool and I think -15 won. But I got to
[161.44s] be honest with you, that group was in
[163.68s] front of us and we saw them taking a lot
[165.44s] of mulligans. So, I&#39;m I&#39;m not saying,
[167.12s] you know, congratulations, but just
[169.28s] saying saying, not saying. Uh there&#39;s
[172.319s] some beautiful there&#39;s the ocean. You
[173.92s] know, it it doesn&#39;t suck out here. I&#39;ll
[175.519s] leave it at that. Um all right, then a
[178.16s] couple goals and we&#39;ll get down to it.
[179.519s] So, this is one of
[182.519s] Mimi&#39;s. She gets the pass
[186.28s] here and she&#39;s just a beast.
[192.04s] Boom. All right. And then last one and
[194.64s] we&#39;ll get down to it here.
[204.319s] Taking it inside.
[208.599s] Boom. All right. Rocking and rolling.
[211.12s] So, um, also one, uh, wearing the
[214.159s] t-shirt today. Thank you for, uh, all
[216.64s] the incredible support. The key here is
[219.519s] to get the word out. you know, I wear
[221.12s] this uh, you know, walking by the beach
[222.959s] and everything and I get tons of
[224.319s] questions all the time. I tell them
[225.519s] about the podcast. More people we share
[227.519s] this with, the more we&#39;re going to just
[229.12s] keep delivering this incredible value
[230.64s] for you guys for a very, very long time.
[233.519s] Uh, in addition to what we do for our
[235.76s] clients. Uh, so, so it&#39;s just
[237.68s] incredible. I think what we&#39;re going to
[239.519s] do because we got so many more orders
[241.2s] than we expected. Um, and again, this is
[243.84s] the t-shirt by the way. Uh, very cool.
[246.879s] And this is the I&#39;m got my mug today.
[249.519s] Very excited. Price is what you pay,
[250.879s] value is what you get, and then hedge
[252.48s] fund tips on the back, uh, with Tom
[255.12s] Hayes. So,
[257.16s] um, so under this, when you go to hedge
[259.68s] fund tips, first off, click on terms.
[261.359s] This is all opinion, not advice. Number
[263.12s] two, when you click on number one hedge
[265.04s] fund podcast, we&#39;re ranked uh by
[267.4s] Feedspot. Um, and you scroll down, we
[270.56s] talk about testimonials and merchandise,
[272.24s] where you can get the merchandise, etc.
[274.24s] Uh, and the testimonials, by the way, we
[276.24s] have like 10 pages of testimonials, and
[279.28s] we haven&#39;t even scraped them in like a
[281.199s] year and a half. So, my assistant
[284.32s] Jennifer is going to start scraping all
[285.759s] the testimonials off of y YouTube and
[288.4s] emails that uh have gone into trash over
[291.68s] the years, and we&#39;re going to get a lot
[293.199s] more testimonials. But what we&#39;re also
[294.8s] going to do, uh, and not everyone&#39;s
[296.8s] going to do this, but the ones that do,
[298.32s] we&#39;re going to build a little hedge fun
[300.0s] community, hedge fun tips community. And
[302.4s] like we did with the burden yourself
[304.4s] with the fax hats, um, those of you who
[308.639s] get merchandise, whether you you got
[310.479s] your mug, uh, or you&#39;ve got your hat or
[313.759s] you got your t-shirt or your hoodie or
[315.52s] your golf shirt, uh, and you want to
[317.36s] send in a picture, email it to
[321.479s] info@hedgefundtips.com.
[323.16s] info@hedgefundtips.com. And I think what
[324.8s] we&#39;re going to start to do over time is
[326.24s] post some of these pictures right here
[328.32s] before the testimonials. And hopefully
[330.639s] over a number of years, you know, we
[332.479s] could have, you know, dozens of pictures
[334.24s] here, uh, of people from all over the
[336.56s] world, uh, wearing their merch and, uh,
[339.12s] showing their part of the community. I
[340.4s] think that would just be a lot of fun.
[341.84s] So, it&#39;s more than just, um, uh,
[345.919s] anonymous handles behind the comments.
[347.84s] You could actually see their names. And
[349.28s] you could submit that with or without
[350.72s] your name. That&#39;s up to you, uh, in
[352.639s] terms of, uh, privacy, etc. So, moving
[355.919s] on.
[359.639s] Um, next week I I leave tomorrow. I&#39;ll
[364.56s] see some friends up in Connecticut. Play
[366.24s] some golf at my club there. And then on
[369.199s] Monday morning I&#39;ll be
[371.8s] on Schwab at Schwab Network at 8:40.
[376.16s] NYSC live with Kristen Scher at 9. And
[379.28s] then uh the 12:00 or 1:00 hour, I&#39;m not
[383.68s] sure which hour. I&#39;ll be on the whole
[385.199s] hour on Fox Business. It&#39;s called the
[387.28s] Big Money Show. Uh Taylor Riggs, Brian
[390.88s] Baronburgg, Jackie D&#39;Angelus,
[393.84s] uh and D in for that. Then on Tuesday in
[397.199s] the morning, sometime between 9 and 12,
[399.199s] I will be on Varnian Co. Super excited
[401.68s] about that. And then on Wednesday at
[405.36s] 10:00 a.m. to 11:00 a.m., I&#39;ll be on the
[407.28s] full hour of Yahoo Finance uh with
[410.639s] Maddie uh over there. And also at 12:30
[415.199s] I&#39;ll be doing a podcast with Jared
[417.52s] Blickery called Stocks and Translation.
[419.759s] That won&#39;t be out for a week after that.
[422.08s] And then 300 p.m. I cap off the three
[424.72s] days of media with the incredible Liz
[427.44s] Clayman at 3:00 on Wednesday. So be sure
[429.84s] to tune in for those episodes. And then
[432.479s] I&#39;m off to uh Palm Beach to see my buddy
[435.36s] Mike Bennett, who uh I know I&#39;ve
[437.84s] mentioned in the past, he&#39;s an
[439.039s] incredible businessman, but uh he also
[441.36s] wrote the book Stack and Tilt uh Golf
[444.8s] with Andy Plameumber. They&#39;ve trained
[447.039s] more PGA Pros than you have any idea. Um
[452.16s] uh it&#39;s always confidential, but if you
[454.0s] ever go down to take lessons with them,
[455.36s] you&#39;ll see five guys lined up behind you
[457.039s] that you recognize on TV. Uh, so I&#39;m
[459.599s] going to play with him and then um then
[462.56s] we&#39;ve got the uh uh meeting with the
[465.36s] speakers down at the Money Show in
[466.88s] Miami. I&#39;ll be speaking on three
[470.319s] segments on Friday. I&#39;ll be speaking
[474.16s] Saturday at around lunch and then a
[477.28s] private room after that. So, three
[480.479s] segments and then I fly to Dubai to see
[483.12s] my friends and clients out there. And
[486.08s] I&#39;m also going to uh meet with some of
[488.319s] the YPO guys on my last day and then
[491.919s] back. So, it&#39;s going to be a whirlwind.
[493.879s] Exciting May. Off to an exciting start.
[498.28s] Um and uh and that&#39;s that. Now, let&#39;s
[501.68s] get you some context for the market
[504.24s] because I had the privilege to go on
[506.08s] with David Lynn. And for those of you
[509.28s] who know, David is one of the a really
[512.88s] phenomenal interviewer and he always
[514.719s] pulls out the best responses from his
[517.839s] guests and then his audience who are
[521.519s] totally engaged, write all kinds of
[524.48s] comments underneath the YouTube uh
[527.72s] video. But uh uh it&#39;s just phenomenal
[530.959s] and we went into a lot of great stuff
[532.64s] and you&#39;ll see some preions here and
[535.44s] you&#39;ll see some substance for for what&#39;s
[537.68s] to come. Uh and I think you&#39;ll find it
[539.92s] really really valuable. So we&#39;re going
[541.12s] to listen in here. People are saying the
[543.2s] world is ending and they feel depressed
[544.88s] and then they&#39;re going out and spending
[546.32s] like there&#39;s no tomorrow. Uh and and uh
[549.519s] the question is does how does that
[550.959s] resolve track? I would not be surprised
[553.279s] that at the end of the year we&#39;re up you
[555.6s] know 7 and 9% on the S&amp;P 500. If we
[558.959s] overshoot, you know, looking at some of
[560.48s] these bre historic breath indicators,
[563.2s] the swag breath indicator has triggered,
[566.16s] maybe we&#39;ll be up low double digits, you
[568.24s] know, 10, 11, 12%, but there&#39;s still uh
[571.2s] tremendous opportunities. Can the stock
[573.44s] markets continue their momentum? Is this
[576.16s] the beginning of the end of a bare
[578.32s] market or we still in a bare market
[579.92s] rather? We&#39;ll find out with our next
[581.04s] guest, Thomas Hayes, a managing member
[583.36s] of Great Hill Capital. Well, Thomas,
[585.04s] it&#39;s always great to get a hedge fund
[586.56s] manager&#39;s perspective on what&#39;s
[587.92s] happening in the markets. Welcome back
[589.2s] to the show. Good to see you. Thanks for
[590.64s] having me, David. Good to be here. Last
[592.32s] time you were on the show was in
[593.6s] January, so wow, time flies. We got to
[595.76s] get you on the show more often. Um,
[597.68s] apologies for not following up sooner,
[599.519s] but uh, time just flew. So, uh, lots
[603.12s] happened in the last couple months,
[604.399s] which probably probably was why time
[606.64s] flew by so quickly. Let&#39;s re let&#39;s
[608.8s] evaluate what you told me earlier in the
[611.12s] year. you had told me that well people
[614.399s] should watch the full length interview
[616.079s] down below but I think in the beginning
[617.44s] of the year you were a little more
[618.64s] cautious in 2025 than you were let&#39;s say
[621.519s] the same period in 2024 last year when
[624.959s] you were on my show a year ago. So have
[627.68s] things played out the way you expected
[629.92s] to so far? Anything caught you off by
[633.279s] surprise? Obviously, the magnitude of
[634.959s] the tariffs caught a lot of fund
[636.399s] managers off, but where were you and in
[639.279s] terms of positioning uh on April 1st,
[642.16s] April 2nd? Yeah, I think look in early
[645.76s] February and March, we were on public
[648.24s] networks talking about uh time to buckle
[652.079s] up, buttercup, we&#39;re going to get some
[653.44s] volatility. Uh I thought we would get
[655.6s] an, you know, 8 to 10% seasonal
[658.6s] pullback. Uh certainly some tariff
[661.04s] uncertainty and that type of thing. Uh
[663.12s] did I expect a 19% uh peak to trough
[666.16s] draw down on the S&amp;P? No. But it was
[668.56s] really an unbelievable blessing in
[670.079s] disguise. It was uh certainly a a
[673.16s] manmade correction. But you know, one of
[676.079s] the themes that uh I said in the
[678.32s] beginning of the year, despite to your
[679.92s] point, we were certainly more cautious
[681.92s] and less sanguin for 2025 than we were
[684.24s] in 2024.
[686.399s] Um, I did say that uh our expectations
[689.76s] were basically uh mid to high uh
[692.8s] singledigit returns for the S&amp;P uh 500
[696.16s] which was uh considered bearish at the
[698.48s] turn of the year by the way. Everyone
[699.92s] was so juiced up on 2024 returns and
[702.399s] we&#39;re like yeah you know more more
[704.16s] subdued and uh oddly enough David I
[706.959s] think we are that&#39;s going to be on
[708.959s] track. I would not be surprised that it
[711.12s] at the end of the year we&#39;re up, you
[713.04s] know, 7 and 9% on the S&amp;P 500. If we
[716.399s] overshoot, you know, looking at some of
[717.92s] these bre historic breath indicator, the
[720.959s] swag breath indicator has triggered,
[723.6s] maybe we&#39;ll be up low double digits, you
[725.68s] know, 10, 11, 12%. But, uh, it&#39;s
[728.959s] meaningfully up from here. And if you
[731.2s] look at the average stock relative to
[733.36s] the S&amp;P, there&#39;s still uh tremendous
[735.76s] opportunities and and great things to do
[738.399s] uh in this environment. But but I I
[740.32s] think that the the key theme, David, is
[743.519s] uh welcome to Trump 2.0, same as Trump
[746.36s] 1.0. Uh tweet volatility resolves to the
[750.0s] upside over time. and looking at that
[752.24s] analog which we were considering two uh
[755.279s] during this draw down. One was the 2018
[759.12s] Trump uh trade war 1.0 where you had a
[762.32s] 20% correction really quickly and the
[765.12s] market resolved to new highs within four
[766.959s] months. And then we were also looking at
[768.8s] a longer more drawn out scenario of
[771.12s] 2011. The European debt crisis 20%
[773.68s] correction took eight months to resolve
[775.839s] to new highs. Uh so we we&#39;ll see which
[778.56s] one this is. Right now, it&#39;s leaning
[780.88s] closer to the 2018 with a higher upside,
[785.2s] but we&#39;re going to need some more pauses
[787.04s] in tariffs and uh and we do have a lot
[789.68s] of businesses on hold waiting for more
[791.68s] clarity. So, that&#39;s that&#39;s not a
[793.36s] constructive thing in the short term.
[795.6s] Okay. Uh let&#39;s talk about tariffs first
[797.6s] and then we&#39;ll revisit your S&amp;P 500 call
[800.16s] that you just made. So, here&#39;s from uh
[802.24s] Bloomberg. Trump suggests some deals.
[804.079s] Trade deals may come as early as this
[805.76s] week. It could be very it could very
[807.839s] well be. Trump told reporters on Sunday
[810.16s] when asked whether any trade agreements
[812.16s] were coming this week. He didn&#39;t specify
[813.92s] any countries were we&#39;re negotiating
[815.519s] with many countries, but at the end of
[816.88s] this I&#39;ll set my own deals because I set
[819.04s] the deal. They don&#39;t set the deal. You
[820.88s] kept asking the same question. When will
[822.639s] you agree? It&#39;s up to me. It&#39;s not up to
[824.48s] them. I suppose he doesn&#39;t mean China.
[826.8s] There&#39;s still 145% tariff on China, I
[828.8s] believe. Uh but anyway, I&#39;ll let you
[830.56s] evaluate what&#39;s going on. Yeah, look, I
[833.2s] think the the number one thing that the
[834.959s] market needed to see and and I have to
[836.8s] say this was a strange correction
[839.279s] because I had um more peers, colleagues,
[844.639s] money managers calling me in abject fear
[847.279s] than I&#39;ve ever seen in a correction. And
[849.44s] I had clients calling me because they
[851.44s] know this is when these are the periods
[853.279s] that I I thrive. Uh calling me and
[856.16s] asking me how they could send more money
[857.6s] in to take advantage of the
[858.959s] opportunities. And many of them did. So
[861.639s] very interesting scenario um and
[865.6s] consistent with what you saw in the
[868.0s] stats that hedge funds were and CTAs
[871.279s] were record sellers of equities over a
[874.32s] trillion dollars at the absolute low in
[877.44s] early April. Apparently they were not on
[879.68s] truth stocial when President Trump said
[882.079s] now is a good time to buy because that
[883.839s] marked a low uh in the stock market. So,
[887.839s] um, so, so the problem with that is that
[892.04s] these quote unquote investors have been
[895.8s] praying for a retest of the lows and
[899.6s] praying rarely works in investing. So
[902.72s] every single tape bomb of a deal with
[906.0s] India or a deal with Japan or a deal
[908.399s] with uh you know some tiny island nation
[911.6s] whatever it happens to be they are going
[913.76s] to be forced mechanical buyers. They are
[917.92s] upside down and now they&#39;re just trying
[920.48s] to stem the bleeding and the redemptions
[922.399s] from missing uh not only selling at the
[925.199s] wrong time but more importantly missing
[927.839s] the opportunity to buy at the right
[929.76s] time. Uh and if you look at what&#39;s
[931.92s] happened with earnings, I mean, yes,
[933.839s] it&#39;s rearview mirror, but with 80% of
[935.92s] the companies reporting, you have
[938.519s] 12.8% earnings growth, uh compared to 6%
[942.48s] that was expected. And estimates, yes,
[945.6s] they&#39;ve come down a little bit for 2024.
[948.56s] They&#39;ve come down about 3.5% year-to
[951.04s] date, but they bottomed about a week and
[953.36s] a half ago at 265 for 2025 on the S&amp;P.
[957.12s] They&#39;re now up to 266, which tells you
[960.639s] guidance is actually starting to
[963.079s] improve. And for
[965.72s] 2026, estimates have held in. So, we&#39;ve
[968.24s] got a lot of backend loaded earnings at
[970.839s] 302, which implies an 18 1.5 times
[974.079s] multiple, which is not crazy, uh,
[976.32s] compared to a 10-year average of 18.3
[978.88s] times. So, uh, that&#39;s kind of where I&#39;m
[981.839s] thinking. And uh the other thought that
[983.68s] I have on tariffs, David, is that I
[986.399s] think you wind up with a net 10% across
[988.8s] the board, which is 300 to400 billion.
[992.16s] Uh which is which is great from a
[994.72s] refinance the debt standpoint, bring
[996.639s] down rate standpoint, spur the housing
[999.199s] market standpoint, uh and um uh improve
[1003.92s] the cost of living standpoint. That
[1006.399s] coupled with low gas prices and a lot of
[1009.12s] other things uh are a good formula. Now,
[1012.16s] if we start to see Navaro on TV every
[1014.48s] day, then we could have problems. But uh
[1016.639s] so far, they&#39;ve kept him in the closet
[1018.8s] and uh it&#39;s been mostly Bessant and a
[1021.44s] little bit of Lutnik here and there. Uh
[1023.759s] and I think Trump is showing a lot of
[1026.24s] flexibility and rationality, which the
[1028.959s] market was unclear whether that was
[1031.28s] going to be coming uh following
[1033.36s] liberation day. you said to Reuters and
[1036.559s] I&#39;ll pull up um uh this quote from
[1039.76s] actually your website hedge fund tips
[1041.919s] you extracted this I do think that what
[1044.64s] today is saying is that the economy is a
[1046.64s] lot stronger than what uh people thought
[1049.6s] and a lot more resilient in the face of
[1051.76s] all these tariffs and fears about
[1053.2s] tariffs um which signals or indicators
[1056.72s] signal to you resilience Thomas I think
[1059.44s] earning earnings and guidance are the
[1061.12s] name of the game I think when you look
[1062.88s] at the negative GDP print. I think that
[1065.28s] was a good wakeup call for the
[1066.84s] administration. Uh the bad news is you
[1069.52s] got a negative GDP print and like 2022,
[1072.72s] if you get two quarters in a row of
[1074.32s] negative GDP prints, you have a
[1076.0s] technical recession and I believe we had
[1078.0s] a recession in 2022 even though the uh
[1082.0s] um the council did not define it as
[1085.84s] such. Uh all the activity and all of the
[1088.88s] results were consistent with the
[1090.24s] recession. So, I think it was a wakeup
[1092.16s] call like, hey, you are threading this
[1094.32s] needle. You&#39;re trying to cut this money
[1095.679s] on Doge, you&#39;re trying to uh balance the
[1098.96s] budget, etc. If you tip into a
[1101.64s] recession, it&#39;s going to cost you way
[1104.16s] more to bring us out of a recession uh
[1106.72s] in terms of lost revenue, in terms of
[1108.6s] stimulus, than it would be to just do
[1111.12s] nothing. So, your Doge cuts will be in
[1113.2s] vain. Uh all of the fiscal constraints
[1115.919s] and layoffs will have been in vain if
[1118.08s] you tip into recession. So while the
[1120.799s] negative uh 30 basis points print for Q1
[1124.16s] GDP was uh
[1127.16s] um not the the the clearest because if
[1130.64s] you back out the inventory building and
[1133.52s] the reduction of government spending,
[1134.88s] you&#39;re at plus 3% GDP. So it&#39;s not what
[1138.64s] you would normally see in a negative
[1140.559s] print. It still is a negative print and
[1142.72s] I can assure you the administration does
[1144.64s] not want to see two consecutive quarters
[1147.919s] of negative prints because that is a
[1149.84s] technical recession and that creates all
[1151.36s] kinds of problems. So they want to they
[1153.12s] want they immediately did an about face.
[1156.24s] They you know paused the tariffs showed
[1158.559s] flexibility with the auto industry uh
[1161.52s] showed uh flexibility with negotiating
[1164.48s] deals with counterparties. So I think in
[1167.2s] that sense uh it was a wakeup call. I
[1170.48s] think they&#39;re going to wind up with it
[1172.88s] will look like they&#39;re, you know,
[1174.48s] they&#39;re blinking on these deals, but at
[1176.32s] the end of the day, they&#39;re going to
[1177.28s] wind up with 300 to 400 billion dollars
[1179.36s] of uh tariff revenue. And um if they had
[1183.84s] started with a 10% ask, we&#39;d be lucky if
[1187.52s] we got 30 or 40. So they asked for the
[1189.679s] world, they wound up with something
[1191.52s] bigger than anyone could have ever ever
[1193.2s] imagined. And it keeps the train on the
[1195.6s] tracks. it doesn&#39;t uh uh you know try
[1199.44s] that the the light at the end of the
[1201.039s] tunnel is not an oncoming train which
[1202.88s] people were worried about in early
[1204.24s] April. It&#39;s actually the end of the
[1206.0s] tunnel. What are you expecting consumer
[1208.4s] sentiment or consumer demand to do for
[1211.36s] the next quarter? I I&#39;ll give you some
[1213.12s] examples. So uh earlier in the year we
[1215.44s] had data come in that advanced retail
[1217.28s] sales continue to grind higher. A lot of
[1219.2s] that came from uh actually trucks and
[1221.679s] cars uh new and old. people were just
[1225.12s] buying them before the new tariff prices
[1227.44s] kicked in. Um, do you expect that trend
[1230.08s] to continue? Do you expect strength to
[1231.84s] continue at all? I do. I think look, you
[1235.52s] never bet against the US consumer when
[1237.36s] they have a job. And we saw the jobs
[1240.24s] report. We saw the unemployment rate
[1241.76s] stay at 4.2%. Job non-farm payrolls came
[1244.96s] in better than expected. There&#39;s an
[1247.84s] interesting dichotomy right now between
[1249.84s] the hard data and the soft data. what
[1252.0s] people say they feel and what they
[1253.84s] actually do. People are saying the world
[1255.44s] is ending and they feel depressed and
[1257.2s] then they&#39;re going out and spending like
[1258.559s] there&#39;s no tomorrow. Uh and and uh the
[1261.84s] question is does how does that resolve?
[1263.919s] Does their sentiment start to improve
[1266.799s] consistent with their actions as more
[1268.799s] deals are announced or does their
[1271.679s] actions start to catch up to their
[1273.52s] sentiment which is what the bears are
[1275.679s] worried about uh if this thing drags out
[1278.48s] longer? Um there was someone on Twitter
[1281.039s] today saying uh the next step should be
[1284.32s] a 180day pause. Maybe we&#39;ll see
[1286.72s] something like that if they don&#39;t get a
[1288.08s] deal announced this week. Uh but I but I
[1290.799s] think that now the American public is
[1294.32s] seeing some rationality and not rigidity
[1296.72s] on behalf of the administration. We&#39;re
[1298.4s] going to get more than we would have
[1299.52s] gotten. Uh but we&#39;re not going to blow
[1301.6s] up the world to do it and create a
[1303.52s] depression or a recession. Uh I think
[1306.0s] people&#39;s sentiment will improve. And the
[1307.679s] thing about the cars, it&#39;s a lot of
[1309.84s] different things coming together at
[1310.96s] once. Number one, dealer incentives are
[1312.64s] going up. I know this I know this
[1313.919s] industry like the back of my hand
[1315.039s] because our largest position is an auto
[1317.36s] parts supplier, which I&#39;ve talked to
[1318.64s] your audience about called Cooper
[1320.159s] Standard, which was up 43% on Friday and
[1323.76s] probably another few percent today. Um
[1326.64s] they supply the ceiling systems uh
[1328.96s] around the windows and doors and the
[1330.96s] fluid transfer systems uh for uh new
[1334.679s] automobiles predominantly to US OEMs.
[1338.4s] And the big deal there what we&#39;ve been
[1340.0s] watching it&#39;s a play on the volume
[1341.52s] recovery which troughed at 15.2 million
[1344.159s] SAR. We expect it to get to normalized
[1346.48s] levels like it has every cycle for the
[1348.4s] last 40 years of 17 12 to 18 million
[1351.799s] SAR. Uh they make money on that volume.
[1355.039s] There are a couple of things. First and
[1356.32s] foremost is the average car on the road
[1357.84s] is 13.5 years. So yeah, they&#39;re going to
[1359.919s] continue to buy. Number two, dealer
[1362.159s] incentives are going up. They had this
[1364.64s] cartel during COVID that they really
[1366.96s] took advantage of people selling above
[1368.799s] MSRP and they kept that game going
[1370.799s] afterwards saying our our supply is
[1372.96s] limited, our supply is limited. Uh and
[1375.44s] that gig is up. So now it&#39;s going to be
[1377.2s] a race to the bottom for OEMs. They&#39;re
[1379.039s] going to put out massive volumes across
[1380.64s] the board and they&#39;re going to compete
[1381.84s] on price and incentives which means
[1383.76s] volumes are going to go up and uh just
[1386.0s] like generators when you know when when
[1388.24s] your neighbor has them and they&#39;re
[1390.08s] watching TV while you&#39;re sitting in the
[1391.76s] dark during a power outage. Uh you get
[1394.08s] one the next time. It&#39;s the same with
[1395.52s] new cars there. There haven&#39;t been a lot
[1397.12s] of new cars. Uh as your neighbors start
[1399.2s] to get them, you&#39;re going to get them.
[1400.4s] And with incentives and with rates
[1402.559s] coming down, Besson&#39;s going to bring
[1403.919s] down that 10-year yield uh by
[1406.159s] eliminating some bank charges. uh uh and
[1409.039s] deregulation on that front. I think a
[1411.28s] lot of good things are going to happen
[1412.88s] uh with with consumer spending and I
[1414.88s] think a lot of it is going to be
[1416.64s] concentrated in the automobile industry
[1419.44s] because it&#39;s needed. 13.5 years is uh
[1421.679s] the oldest the fleet has ever been and
[1423.84s] we have uh 72 some odd millennials that
[1427.36s] need cars, starting new families, moving
[1429.44s] out to the suburbs, etc. Yeah, that I
[1431.84s] wonder what that&#39;s going to do to the
[1432.799s] auto industry. Just let us know, we&#39;ll
[1434.4s] move on. Uh clearing inventory. I I just
[1436.96s] happened to have walked into a Tesla
[1438.4s] dealership yesterday while I was waiting
[1440.4s] for something else and they told me that
[1442.08s] uh the they have the inventory prices
[1444.4s] for their models in inventory and then
[1446.0s] they have the tariff prices if you order
[1448.48s] online that&#39;s going to come in a couple
[1450.0s] that&#39;s like 20 grand more for every
[1451.919s] model which is a big number for Canada.
[1454.64s] So yeah, that that sounds like a sales
[1456.559s] pitch. they won&#39;t get away with that
[1458.48s] because there&#39;s so there&#39;s so much
[1461.279s] supply that&#39;s coming on and and then
[1463.679s] everyone that&#39;s worried about oh this
[1465.2s] was a one-time pull pull forward well
[1467.679s] they&#39;re going to now have to replenish
[1469.12s] those inventories and they&#39;re and all
[1471.12s] the manufacturers are going to be doing
[1472.48s] it which is going to create a lot of
[1473.76s] supply and a lot of incentives so um you
[1476.32s] know Tesla if if Tesla believes that
[1478.32s] they&#39;re going to get a rude awakening
[1479.52s] call as they bring prices down in coming
[1481.36s] months this is why we should go shopping
[1483.36s] with Tom Hayes but uh Tom uh tell us
[1485.919s] about the FOMC See, we&#39;re expecting a um
[1488.799s] a no uh no action from the FOMC. Well,
[1491.36s] that&#39;s what the uh markets are expecting
[1493.36s] for this week. Um what&#39;s happening for
[1496.08s] the rest of the year? How many rate cuts
[1497.679s] are we expecting, if any, are you
[1499.44s] expecting? Yeah, it&#39;s interesting. You
[1500.96s] know, we saw uh last week, we we saw
[1504.88s] negative GDP. We saw the PCE come in the
[1508.24s] lowest it&#39;s been, which is the Fed
[1509.919s] favored number. Uh lowest it&#39;s been
[1512.0s] since November. Uh so those were the two
[1515.76s] pieces, but what what have they been
[1517.6s] talking about? Waller and the Cleveland
[1519.36s] governor, uh they&#39;ve all been saying
[1520.96s] we&#39;re watching the labor market. So we
[1522.559s] saw the ADP was weak and we&#39;re like,
[1524.559s] okay, if the jobs numbers weak, the Fed
[1526.559s] could move, you know, soon. Uh jobs
[1529.919s] number was very strong. So it might be a
[1532.799s] little bit backward looking, but uh
[1535.6s] certainly 100% takes May off the table.
[1538.48s] June is uh you know was at 65% odds.
[1542.32s] It&#39;s probably a little lower now. I&#39;d
[1544.159s] say June is a coin flip. I still am of
[1546.32s] the camp we&#39;re getting to before the end
[1547.919s] of the year. Your overall tone reminds
[1550.24s] me of uh Warren Buffett&#39;s speech over
[1552.96s] the weekend when he announced his
[1554.24s] retirement. The time has arrived
[1557.4s] where Greg should become the chief
[1561.279s] executive officer of the company at year
[1564.72s] end. And I want to spring that on the
[1568.0s] directors effectively and give that as
[1570.4s] my recommendation. He said uh he was
[1572.32s] very lucky to have b to have been born
[1574.559s] in America. Uh I&#39;m paraphrasing here,
[1577.12s] but we should continue to invest in
[1578.72s] America and uh long-term he&#39;s very
[1581.44s] bullish on the prospects of capitalism
[1583.44s] in America. I&#39;m guessing you largely
[1586.24s] agree, but how do we make that an
[1588.08s] investment thesis here? Yeah, look,
[1589.76s] Buffett is my hero. Um I learned so much
[1592.64s] from him and Charlie over the years.
[1594.88s] It&#39;s it&#39;s shaped a lot of who I am.
[1597.12s] Obviously, I have my own uh special
[1599.44s] sauce. turnaround, Tom. I like I like
[1601.279s] more turnarounds, more of what Buffett
[1603.039s] was doing when he was running outside
[1604.559s] money the first 12 years than what what
[1607.2s] he did during Birkshire. Uh look, US
[1611.679s] exceptionalism will never change. And
[1613.44s] the reason that will never change is
[1615.52s] because we because of immigration. I
[1618.159s] mean, that&#39;s fundamentally what it comes
[1619.6s] down to is we&#39;ve had the best ideas and
[1622.32s] the best minds and the risktakers from
[1624.96s] around the world who took a chance and
[1626.96s] came to America. And it&#39;s that this
[1629.6s] repository of the best of everything in
[1633.12s] the world in one place plus natural
[1635.12s] resources plus good defense borders. So
[1637.36s] that&#39;s never going to change. Now does
[1638.96s] that mean US equities have to outperform
[1641.76s] because America is so great? Uh no. If
[1644.799s] and if you are willing to look past a
[1647.2s] little recency bias of the last decade,
[1649.44s] you&#39;ll see that every 10 to 15 years,
[1651.84s] you run in cycles where uh dollar is
[1654.72s] strong and US equities outperform, which
[1657.36s] is what you&#39;ve seen in the zero interest
[1659.2s] rate policy uh period post great
[1662.0s] financial crisis plus a few extra years.
[1664.48s] Uh but then if you look back even during
[1666.48s] Reagan, there were period there was a
[1668.0s] big period there that international
[1669.919s] equities outperformed US. Not because US
[1672.24s] wasn&#39;t great, not because re Reagan&#39;s
[1674.32s] policies were were bad or the rest of
[1676.64s] the world got better than the US. It&#39;s
[1678.32s] just a normal cycle. Some of it has to
[1680.96s] do with US dollar currency. Some of it
[1683.36s] has to do with earnings power. But it is
[1685.919s] a regular cycle every 10 to 15 years.
[1689.52s] International outperforms US then US
[1691.6s] outperforms international. And I do
[1693.52s] think we are on the cusp where we&#39;re
[1695.12s] going into and have already started
[1697.52s] actually a period where international
[1700.0s] equities uh outperform and that could
[1703.12s] simply be a function of multiples as uh
[1707.12s] mag 7 have been more subdued uh and um
[1712.159s] uh their waiting starts to normalize in
[1714.72s] the S&amp;P 500 the index&#39;s weights and
[1718.72s] composition may start to look a bit
[1721.039s] closer to international And then you&#39;ve
[1723.279s] got some earnings growth in some
[1724.88s] international pockets which is really
[1726.48s] exciting like China Tech uh etc. that
[1729.279s] could start to take up some of the
[1730.799s] weight in the international indices and
[1732.64s] then the institutional flows and it&#39;s a
[1735.2s] it&#39;s a flywheel you know as more money
[1737.279s] goes in the multiples go up that which
[1739.36s] creates more more flow which is what the
[1741.6s] US has benefited from for the last 15
[1744.08s] years and I think we&#39;re probably going
[1745.84s] to moderate relative returns even though
[1748.64s] we&#39;ll have good returns we&#39;ll moderate
[1750.32s] relative returns and I think the
[1751.52s] outperformers are going to be the ones
[1752.799s] that have exposure to international in
[1755.279s] the next 10 years that was my next
[1757.039s] question if not the US equity Where
[1759.84s] should we go for outperformance? Well,
[1762.32s] look, I I talked about Cooper Standard,
[1764.159s] which was a US company. We have a huge
[1766.24s] position in uh we&#39;ve had a huge position
[1768.559s] in Alibaba. I mean, and that&#39;s been, you
[1770.88s] know, couple years in waiting. Every red
[1773.039s] day we&#39;ve been buying stock and it, you
[1775.039s] know, it&#39;s it&#39;s now rallied and and uh
[1777.679s] we&#39;ve got a a average basis across all
[1780.399s] accounts of about $83. We think that&#39;s
[1782.88s] just getting started. Now, we&#39;ve got the
[1784.64s] problem that you got all these
[1786.399s] politicians that say, &quot;Let&#39;s torch US
[1788.88s] investors and delist it and uh and cost
[1792.0s] US investors $800 billion,&quot; which would
[1794.88s] be the dumbest political move of all
[1796.64s] time uh to torch. It doesn&#39;t hurt China
[1800.559s] to delist Chinese companies. It&#39;s not
[1802.88s] Chinese investors that are buying US
[1804.559s] ADRs. It only hurts US investors. So,
[1806.88s] we&#39;ve shifted all of our equity exposure
[1810.64s] to Hong Kong Holdings just in case
[1813.44s] stupid political decisions are made, but
[1816.24s] uh we still do own some uh derivative
[1819.52s] exposure in uh in the US and we&#39;ll just
[1822.64s] absorb that risk uh because we can&#39;t
[1825.039s] replicate it in Hong Kong. But the bulk
[1826.799s] of our allocation is now held in Hong
[1829.44s] Kong shares just to hedge out that uh
[1832.399s] that D-listing risk which I think was
[1834.799s] more acute a couple of years ago when it
[1837.279s] ultimately came through with flying
[1838.799s] colors through the
[1839.88s] PCAOB. Uh and I&#39;m sure this is probably
[1843.279s] some part of the negotiating leverage
[1846.32s] with China. Come to the table and do a
[1848.72s] deal or we will take away your access to
[1851.2s] US capital markets. and it&#39;s being
[1853.279s] fostered by a couple actors like Rick
[1855.919s] Scott and others who are the headline
[1858.48s] grabbers for the negotiating leverage
[1861.679s] with China. But I think when all is said
[1863.44s] and done, I&#39;d assign maybe a you know,
[1866.399s] it&#39;s it&#39;s a lot less than a coin flip
[1868.32s] odds of delisting. Uh I&#39;d say it&#39;s
[1870.96s] probably 20% because it only it only
[1873.36s] hurts us. I think if they really were
[1874.96s] sincere about it, what they would do is
[1876.64s] say u we&#39;re not going to screw the US
[1879.279s] investor. we you know what what&#39;s what&#39;s
[1881.76s] listed here is going to stay listed here
[1884.48s] but we are closing the door to any new
[1886.64s] offerings in the US prospectively that
[1889.44s] would be like a sincere um uh play where
[1894.0s] I would I&#39;d be more concerned if that
[1895.84s] was the case because that would that
[1897.279s] would tell me that they&#39;ve actually
[1898.48s] thought it through it wasn&#39;t just an
[1900.12s] anti-China sentiment um and and if they
[1904.08s] had thought it through and then they cut
[1905.6s] off capital markets I mean all that
[1907.679s] effectively happens is you take billions
[1909.919s] of dollars of fees that go to US banks
[1912.0s] and you push them out to London and you
[1914.08s] push them out to Hong Kong exchanges. Uh
[1916.559s] which again hurts the US more than it
[1918.32s] hurts China. But um if that&#39;s the if
[1920.96s] that&#39;s the direction they take policy,
[1923.2s] we we&#39;ve hedged because what they can&#39;t
[1925.36s] do by delisting them is change the
[1927.76s] earnings power of an Alibaba or a 10
[1930.64s] cent. Uh and the free cash flow they
[1932.72s] generate and the amount of shares that
[1934.08s] they buy back and the the number one AI
[1936.96s] play in the world right now, their Quen
[1939.039s] 2.5 is outperforming Deepseek. It&#39;s
[1941.919s] outperforming ChatG GPT and they own a
[1944.72s] equity stake in pretty much every AI
[1946.96s] startup in China because they give them
[1949.039s] cloud computing services. They&#39;re number
[1950.88s] one in cloud computing in exchange uh
[1953.6s] for equity in their companies. So uh
[1956.559s] there&#39;s a lot of outs uh like we we like
[1958.72s] to say in poker by owning Alibaba. You
[1960.799s] got the number one toll taker as the
[1962.799s] Chinese government wants to uh move the
[1965.76s] Chinese economy to 70% consumption over
[1968.159s] the next 10 years. Alibaba will get 40
[1970.399s] cents on every dollar as a toll taker
[1972.48s] goes through Alibaba. Um and uh a lot a
[1976.96s] lot of positive things happening. So
[1978.24s] China uh certainly opportunities in in
[1981.279s] beating down Europe um uh emerging
[1983.84s] markets etc. So there are a lot of
[1985.2s] things to do and there are a lot of
[1986.399s] things to do in the US if you&#39;re not in
[1988.88s] the indices and you&#39;re not in the most
[1990.48s] crowded trades. There are a lot of
[1991.679s] companies that are still very
[1992.799s] undervalued. Are you ready to meet the
[1995.039s] biggest minds in Bitcoin face to face?
[1998.24s] Well, this summer, the crypto capital of
[2000.159s] the world isn&#39;t Silicon Valley or New

[2042.399s] tickets are sold out completely. We&#39;ll
[2044.159s] see you in Vegas. Are you betting on the
[2048.079s] Chinese economy uh when you&#39;re investing
[2050.159s] in Hong Kong equities at all? uh are you
[2052.24s] exposed to Chinese growth? For example,
[2054.32s] I was reading just now uh China&#39;s
[2056.399s] exports rose 6.9% in Q1 2025 despite
[2060.0s] despite the ongoing trade wars uh with
[2062.96s] the US. Uh Chinese officials recently
[2065.28s] said the sky won&#39;t fall for China&#39;s
[2067.04s] exports uh especially since they&#39;re
[2069.04s] diverting a lot of their USbound exports
[2070.879s] to um other countries in Southeast Asia
[2072.96s] and perhaps domestic consumers. So um
[2075.599s] what&#39;s your take on Chinese growth here?
[2077.679s] 100%. It&#39;s a dimminitimous portion. Like
[2080.159s] it&#39;s almost I I I think if the
[2083.119s] apocalypse happened and there was a US
[2084.879s] embargo on Chinese goods, I think it
[2086.639s] would affect Chinese GDP by 1 to one and
[2088.8s] a half%. So um you know I they they&#39;ve
[2093.599s] kind of been preparing for this number
[2095.119s] one. Number two, they already devalued
[2096.879s] the yuan by like 20%. So it&#39;s like oh
[2099.92s] you want to char us 20%. We&#39;ve already
[2102.079s] priced that in. So thank you very much.
[2104.24s] If you want to do a deal we&#39;ll
[2105.52s] appreciate the yuan. So, it&#39;s kind of
[2107.2s] silly season and uh uh I understand why
[2110.56s] they&#39;re doing it. And by the way,
[2111.76s] there&#39;s a deal to be done because the
[2113.839s] US, if you look at the percentage of
[2116.32s] manufacturing versus consumption in
[2118.16s] China versus the percentage of
[2119.839s] manufacturing versus consumption in the
[2121.599s] US, it&#39;s like a 20 point spread. And
[2123.839s] they just basically want to meet in the
[2125.2s] middle middle. If we got 10 more points
[2126.72s] of manufacturing and they got 10 more
[2128.48s] points of consumption, it&#39;s a win for
[2130.32s] both countries. So, they&#39;re going to do
[2131.52s] a deal. There&#39;s probably no no dlisting.
[2134.0s] if they don&#39;t do a deal, it hurts their
[2136.16s] GDP one one and a half percent and
[2138.0s] they&#39;ll just, you know, amp up the
[2139.839s] stimulus which helps companies like
[2141.119s] Alibaba. Am I making making a bet on
[2143.359s] China uh China&#39;s economy? Implicitly
[2146.8s] yes. But Alibaba got so undervalued as a
[2150.32s] sum of the parts. I mean at you know
[2152.8s] between the number one cloud provider,
[2154.8s] number one retailer to the middle class.
[2156.48s] So as their economy is recovering and
[2158.079s] the stimulus has kicked in um there
[2161.599s] there just so you know the the demand
[2165.28s] for compute power uh and AI and
[2168.32s] everything going on with Alibaba there
[2169.92s] there&#39;s just nothing like it in the
[2171.68s] world where price is what you pay value
[2173.76s] is what you get quoting Warren Buffett
[2176.24s] uh that you could have done this and
[2178.64s] yeah it&#39;s up a bunch from where we own
[2180.64s] it but I think it&#39;s just getting started
[2183.2s] so uh irrespective of whether they do a
[2185.839s] good deal or bad deal? Obviously, I&#39;d
[2187.52s] prefer a good deal that makes sense for
[2189.44s] both parties and I think President Trump
[2191.119s] wants a good deal for both parties. Uh
[2193.44s] he&#39;s more of a pragmatist than an
[2195.92s] idealist and that&#39;s started to come out
[2198.0s] in recent weeks. But if you read all his
[2200.4s] books, he always starts with punch you
[2202.48s] in the face first and then offer you an
[2204.16s] ice pack and that&#39;s how he gets to a
[2206.64s] final deal. So, all right. Well, so Hong
[2210.16s] Kong equities, what about other asset
[2211.76s] classes? like diversified across other
[2213.839s] asset classes outside of equities as a
[2215.68s] hedge. Uh we&#39;re we&#39;re an equity manager.
[2218.079s] So we run a concentrated equity
[2220.079s] portfolio with derivative overlay for
[2222.16s] family offices and ultra high net worth
[2224.0s] individuals.
[2226.52s] Um so I guess not. So so the answer is
[2230.48s] is is no. But I could see a scenario
[2234.599s] where so we would express it through
[2237.2s] equities. Uh you know materials have
[2239.2s] been left for dead. I think uh I think
[2242.0s] there are some commodity plays to be
[2243.599s] had. You know, we we have had a view
[2246.32s] when it was unpopular
[2248.56s] uh that the dollar was going to continue
[2250.24s] to weaken. Now that everyone is kind of
[2252.4s] in that boat, we probably get a counter
[2254.079s] trend bounce in the short term uh and
[2256.24s] then resume the the intermediate
[2258.72s] downtrend uh a few months out. But uh
[2261.52s] you know, when you see it on the cover
[2262.64s] of the Economist and Baronss at uh end
[2265.76s] of the dollar, it&#39;s like all right, so
[2267.119s] now we&#39;re going to get a bounce. So, uh,
[2270.24s] uh, I I I definitely like materials. I
[2272.72s] like some commodity plays. I&#39;m trying to
[2274.32s] figure out how to get more exposure to
[2275.92s] energy. We&#39;ve got a big position in
[2277.52s] comtock resources from just below $9.
[2280.8s] It&#39;s it&#39;s up a lot. It&#39;s a natural gas
[2282.72s] play on the Hannesville. Jerry Jones,
[2284.64s] the owner of the Cowboys, owns 66% of
[2286.72s] that. Uh, so we&#39;re trying to figure out
[2289.04s] maybe oil servicesers, try not to play
[2291.2s] the price of oil, but just the volume.
[2292.96s] Kind of like what we did with the auto
[2294.4s] industry. We don&#39;t want to be in the
[2295.599s] OEMs, the car manufacturers. We want to
[2297.76s] be in the the arms dealers, the
[2299.599s] suppliers. Let the car manufacturers
[2301.28s] duke it out. Race to the bottom in terms
[2303.44s] of margins and let the suppliers benefit
[2305.28s] from volume. I think that&#39;s going to be
[2307.04s] the case with uh you know natural gas is
[2309.44s] a covert play on AI demand uh and
[2312.72s] compute demand running the data centers.
[2314.64s] We we need unlimited amounts of energy
[2316.72s] and I think natural gas is going to be
[2318.32s] the transition. So there&#39;s a lot to do
[2320.0s] there as well. Interesting. Uh final
[2322.48s] question since you brought up what
[2323.92s] people are feeling. What is the
[2325.119s] prevailing sentiment in the equities
[2326.88s] markets right now? Uh we&#39;ve had a bit of
[2328.88s] a rebound as I mentioned in the
[2330.24s] beginning and we talked about this. Um
[2331.92s] is it still one of fear and uncertainty
[2333.92s] or are people more uh a little more
[2336.24s] bullish now in May? If you look at the
[2338.96s] sentiment indicators and you look at the
[2340.64s] positioning, yes, VIX has come down.
[2343.119s] Yes, you&#39;ve had the breath thrust. I
[2344.88s] think people are still skeptical and I
[2346.32s] think I think there are a lot of bears
[2348.079s] that are angry and are are praying to
[2351.2s] God that they see a retest of the lows.
[2353.92s] And my guess is we&#39;ll get a couple of
[2356.16s] deals and maybe consolidate, you know,
[2358.24s] get a get a few percent pull back in in
[2360.56s] coming weeks and the bears will think
[2362.16s] that they&#39;re on track and it&#39;s going to
[2363.599s] go back and retest and then we we push
[2365.599s] higher and higher because the earnings
[2367.92s] and the guidance, I mean, the fact that
[2370.8s] we can have this level of guidance and
[2372.56s] still looking at $32 of earnings in 2026
[2376.48s] despite knowing all of this chaos, uh,
[2380.4s] is telling me that, god forbid we get
[2382.56s] any good news, the pent-up demand. I
[2385.4s] mean, you know, I see it and feel it
[2387.839s] just in my daily life at the
[2389.28s] restaurants, at, you know, shopping, at
[2391.28s] the malls, etc., travel. I mean, people
[2395.68s] don&#39;t seem to have a care in the world
[2397.119s] from what I can see. I I I certainly
[2399.2s] hear it in the conference calls of the
[2401.28s] at the very lower end. Uh, there is some
[2403.839s] strain, uh, etc. And we understand that,
[2406.8s] but to the, you know, to circle back,
[2409.68s] people still have jobs. And when people
[2411.28s] have jobs in America, they tend to
[2412.64s] spend. Excellent. Well, uh let&#39;s uh
[2415.92s] let&#39;s see what uh happens later in the
[2418.48s] year. Your track record on my show has
[2420.16s] been pretty impeccable so far. So, uh if
[2422.56s] you&#39;re bullish, then we should pro
[2423.92s] probably look at that as a as a signal.
[2426.56s] Um I&#39;m just wondering whether or not the
[2429.2s] to my previous question, I&#39;m just
[2430.48s] wondering whether or not there was a
[2431.599s] strong sentiment that we could play as a
[2433.68s] counter trend, but it seems like people
[2435.68s] are kind of on the fence right now.
[2437.2s] Yeah, I Yeah, I think you know the the
[2439.28s] extreme that was a no-brainer was in
[2441.76s] early April and uh and we were kind of
[2444.64s] identifying that on our podcast. Uh I
[2447.599s] think at this point the the the bears
[2450.8s] know they&#39;re screwed, so they&#39;re just
[2452.32s] praying for a second bite at the apple
[2454.0s] to be able to buy at new lows. and the
[2457.8s] bulls that you know usually what happens
[2461.68s] is everyone probably bought up on
[2463.92s] Thursday and Friday after 8 n days up
[2466.96s] and so those people need to get punished
[2469.04s] so my guess is you&#39;ll see some
[2470.96s] short-term volatility in the coming
[2472.48s] weeks maybe a few% pullback just to hurt
[2475.2s] the Johnny come latelys and then when
[2477.28s] the bears think they&#39;re back in control
[2479.04s] we rip higher and that would be
[2481.28s] consistent with what we saw in the 2018
[2484.24s] recovery in Trump 1.0 I know. So, look,
[2486.88s] those are best guesses. I mean, at the
[2488.48s] end of the day, I just like to look at
[2490.24s] companies and what I did on uh I did a
[2493.359s] call on April 7th for my clients and we
[2495.68s] went through company by company just the
[2497.839s] free cash flow and the balance sheet and
[2499.839s] we&#39;re like, look, the worst case
[2500.88s] scenario could happen. These things are
[2502.48s] priced priced for that and if you get
[2504.8s] any possible good news, we&#39;re going to
[2506.319s] have the most incredible uh few months
[2509.04s] uh we&#39;ve ever seen. And that&#39;s that&#39;s
[2510.48s] been the case in the last few weeks.
[2512.16s] It&#39;s been insane uh to the upside. And
[2514.96s] uh fortunately I have really incredibly
[2517.599s] smart clients who uh were sending in a
[2520.48s] ton of money at the lows to buy stocks
[2522.64s] uh versus the opposite. So very grateful
[2524.96s] on that front and um you know we take it
[2527.359s] week by week as the facts change we
[2529.119s] adjust our viewpoint but on balance uh
[2532.079s] what we said in the beginning of the
[2533.2s] year I think is going to hold true. I I
[2534.8s] like the high single digits upside for
[2537.839s] the S&amp;P 500 and uh maybe a little more
[2540.96s] if we get a lot of good news, but uh
[2542.56s] it&#39;ll be it&#39;ll be some bumps between now
[2544.4s] and then to get there and just uh use
[2547.119s] those as opportunities. All right,
[2548.96s] perfect. Thank you. Where can we follow

[2592.64s] and we&#39;re back. So, thanks to David Lynn
[2594.96s] for that. Uh, also want to thank
[2600.2s] um had a chance to talk
[2603.4s] to Andrea Hang and
[2607.64s] Haranto Deon uh about Warren Buffett&#39;s
[2611.599s] retiring and the future of Bergkshire
[2613.2s] Hathway. I know a lot of you own
[2614.64s] Berkshire Hathaway stock. So I gave some
[2618.319s] uh thoughts on how I&#39;m thinking about
[2620.72s] that and you can listen in here. Open
[2623.28s] for business on CNA 938.
[2626.4s] Bshire Haway held its annual shareholder
[2629.04s] meeting in Omaha, Nebraska and its CEO
[2632.4s] Warren Buffett picked the very final
[2634.8s] minute of that gathering to drop a
[2636.76s] bombshell. The Oracle of Omaha is
[2640.079s] stepping down. Well, it was an
[2642.4s] anticipated announcement from the 94
[2644.56s] year old. He is 94. Uh but the news
[2647.28s] still came as a surprise to shareholders
[2650.079s] who were present and even to his own
[2653.119s] handpicked successor, Greg Ael. Uh he&#39;s
[2656.64s] not only the savviest investor of our
[2658.8s] time, Mr. Buffett, but he also built
[2661.04s] Burkshshire Hathaway from a failing
[2663.76s] business into a trillionoll company
[2667.28s] today. Mhm. Under him, Burkshshire&#39;s
[2669.92s] annualized shareholder return has
[2672.48s] roughly doubled that of the S&amp;P 500.
[2675.68s] Now, the company has close to 200
[2678.16s] businesses, including Geico Car
[2680.839s] Insurance, the BNSF Railroad, Industrial
[2684.48s] and Chemical Companies, utilities, and
[2686.56s] even the Dairy Queen ice cream. So, what
[2688.96s] will Burkshire Heatherway look like
[2690.56s] without Warren Buffett? Well, let&#39;s get
[2692.48s] the thoughts of Thomas Hayes, chairman
[2694.4s] and managing member at Great Hill
[2695.839s] Capital. Uh Thomas, thank you for
[2697.839s] setting aside time to speak with us uh
[2699.599s] this morning on Open for Business. We
[2701.92s] have to ask you first uh did
[2704.04s] announcement come as a shock to you even
[2706.64s] though we all knew he&#39;d stepped down at
[2708.64s] some point.
[2711.68s] Yeah, we just didn&#39;t think he would be
[2713.359s] stepping down vertically. We thought it
[2714.88s] would be when he was horizontal. So, uh
[2716.96s] I think it was uh quite a bit of a
[2719.2s] surprise for everyone.
[2721.359s] uh absolutely the greatest investor in
[2724.24s] the world of all time and to your point
[2727.599s] uh 5.5 million% return since 1965 versus
[2732.8s] the S&amp;P of 40,000 give or take in
[2735.92s] English that just means he did about
[2738.119s] 19.9% per year for 60 years and the S&amp;P
[2741.839s] did 10.4 4 and it was less the great
[2745.44s] decisions that he made than the big
[2748.56s] problems he avoided. You know, I
[2750.319s] remember the covers of Forbes and other
[2753.359s] magazines in 1999 and 2000 when they all
[2757.28s] asked, &quot;Did Warren Buffett lose his
[2759.119s] touch because he wasn&#39;t investing in
[2761.04s] tech stocks and he was buying all these
[2762.96s] value stocks and these boring
[2764.64s] companies.&quot; Uh and then the next uh
[2767.119s] couple of years came when the NASDAQ
[2768.96s] fell some 80 90% and Buffett was uh up
[2773.2s] up for the next 3 four years and uh
[2775.44s] laughing all the way to the bank. But
[2776.96s] that&#39;s that&#39;s Warren and he never took
[2779.119s] victory laps. He he just let his actions
[2781.76s] speak for themselves. So obviously
[2783.92s] you&#39;re a big big fan of Warren Buffett.
[2786.24s] I mean no surprises there. I am as well.
[2789.119s] How did you react though when he
[2791.28s] announced Greg Ael as his successor?
[2795.44s] Well, listen, Greg is an incredible
[2797.28s] business operator, but you know, it&#39;s
[2800.0s] kind of like uh Taylor Swift and her
[2802.24s] band. When Taylor steps steps down, how
[2804.4s] many people are going to show up to
[2805.52s] watch the band? I mean, he&#39;s built an
[2807.839s] incredible conglomerate. It&#39;s a uh very
[2811.119s] solid, rockolid business. But without
[2814.319s] Warren, it kind of loses that magic
[2816.24s] touch. And uh I would estimate on a go
[2820.079s] forward basis you&#39;re you&#39;re effectively
[2822.8s] got a compilation of businesses uh like
[2825.359s] Haranto was referring to 180 some
[2827.92s] businesses it kind of represents the S&amp;P
[2830.76s] 500. Uh unless you saw some
[2834.0s] transformative or see some
[2836.359s] transformative deal to sop up some of
[2839.04s] that $350 billion of cash before he
[2842.52s] passes. Um once he does pass, I think
[2845.839s] there&#39;s going to be a lot of uh noise to
[2848.96s] start to issue dividends, to break up
[2851.28s] the company, some of the parts. They
[2853.28s] won&#39;t do that because he&#39;s probably
[2855.04s] taken every possible action he can to
[2857.599s] prevent them from doing that. But uh but
[2860.16s] that&#39;s that&#39;s really going to be the
[2861.52s] story. And uh without the Apple
[2864.0s] investment
[2865.76s] um you know the performance last 20
[2867.52s] years cuz a law of large numbers was a a
[2871.839s] lot more muted than obviously the first
[2874.119s] uh 40 years before that and that&#39;s just
[2877.28s] uh by nature you know $1.1 trillion
[2880.56s] business now $350 billion of cash. It&#39;s
[2883.44s] going to be much harder to move the
[2885.119s] needle and have that level of
[2886.319s] outperformance moving forward. And the
[2888.319s] one thing that no one&#39;s been talking
[2889.68s] about this weekend uh Andreanne Haranto
[2892.88s] is uh one of the huge money makers
[2894.88s] besides Warren&#39;s stock and business
[2897.52s] picking ability was Ajit&#39;s underwriting
[2899.839s] ability and uh Ajet is getting up there
[2902.4s] in age and uh we you know he was
[2906.079s] responsible for creating all that free
[2908.16s] investment float from the insurance
[2909.839s] premium uh and he will be very very very
[2913.119s] difficult to replicate as well. I mean,
[2915.119s] but Buffett had joked over the years, if
[2917.44s] you have a choice, uh, you know, kind of
[2919.839s] if there&#39;s a safety raft on a boat and
[2921.76s] you and one person can fit, make sure
[2923.76s] you put a Jeep in the raft and leave me
[2925.599s] on the sinking ship because a Jeep has
[2927.599s] been a major major money maker over the
[2929.68s] decade. Thomas, Burkshire without
[2933.04s] Buffett is a theme that&#39;s going around
[2935.04s] because that&#39;s just how synonymous the
[2937.04s] two are. Some investors, they worry
[2939.52s] about the future of the company without
[2940.88s] the Buffett magic through Greg uh Ael.
[2944.079s] What will Burkshire&#39;s board as well as
[2946.0s] Mr. Buffett and Mr. Ael need to do to I
[2949.04s] suppose convince investors that the
[2951.359s] company is in safe hands?
[2954.64s] Well, look, I I think Greg Ael is a
[2957.2s] competent operator. Todd and Ted at the
[2959.92s] investment wheel. Um we, you know, he we
[2963.76s] didn&#39;t really get
[2965.72s] a they weren&#39;t brought out um to the
[2969.76s] forefront as much. So I I think
[2971.76s] investors don&#39;t really know what to
[2973.44s] think of their investment ability.
[2974.88s] Obviously Buffett Buffett has huge
[2977.839s] confidence in them or they wouldn&#39;t be
[2979.359s] in that position and they wouldn&#39;t have
[2980.8s] continued in that position and they&#39;re
[2982.16s] very smart investors. But the Buffett
[2984.72s] magic touch is a whole different story.
[2987.28s] And I think in order to move the needle
[2990.52s] beyond basically being a proxy for the
[2993.2s] S&amp;P 500 post Buffett, uh a a real
[2997.76s] transformative business deal needs to be
[2999.92s] done before Buffett passes. And and you
[3002.079s] look at the ones that they&#39;ve done in
[3003.52s] the past, uh whether it was um uh
[3007.599s] Mid-Americ Energy in 2000, they paid $2
[3010.4s] billion. That was that&#39;s where they got
[3012.319s] Greg Ael from. uh or Burlington Northern
[3015.92s] Santa Fe Railroad in 2010. He bought
[3018.319s] that for 26 billion. Uh they really need
[3021.68s] a needle mover uh to kind of give
[3025.76s] investors the idea that this can
[3028.079s] continue to have outperformance because
[3029.68s] that 2% outperformance for the last
[3031.599s] decades which is very impressive uh was
[3034.48s] largely attributed to the investment in
[3036.92s] Apple. Um so they&#39;re they&#39;re they&#39;re
[3039.76s] really going to need something like
[3041.04s] that. Otherwise, you just have to accept
[3043.119s] it&#39;s a $1.1 trillion company. Hard to
[3045.68s] grow at 20% a year at that level. Uh and
[3049.599s] just um effectively, you know, take a
[3052.64s] choice whether it&#39;s the S&amp;P or uh
[3055.119s] Bergkshire, you&#39;re probably going to get
[3056.64s] similar type of returns over the next
[3058.4s] decade. Well, Buffett seems to think
[3060.72s] that Ables has what it takes to uh get
[3063.92s] there or even take Berkshire Health away
[3066.16s] even beyond that. But the thing is he&#39;s
[3068.72s] also inheriting the company at a really
[3070.96s] tough time in American uh in the
[3073.44s] American economy so to speak with Mr.
[3076.4s] Trump and his tariff policies among many
[3080.0s] other things that are weighing on
[3081.599s] Americans right now. How will his
[3084.72s] challenges differ from that of Warren
[3087.76s] Buffett&#39;s say? I mean it&#39;s it&#39;s hard to
[3089.599s] beat like you say 60 years of returns at
[3093.359s] 20% or more. I mean, it&#39;s it&#39;s going to
[3096.16s] be a tough call for Mr. Ael given the
[3098.96s] current environment he&#39;s in. Do you
[3100.4s] think?
[3102.64s] Well, look, I mean, if your boss set you
[3105.52s] up with $350 billion of cash, you&#39;d have
[3108.0s] to work really hard to screw it up. Uh,
[3110.319s] I mean, uh, he&#39;s got an awful lot of
[3112.559s] cushion and a lot awful lot of
[3114.64s] optionality to make good things happen.
[3117.2s] And I think he&#39;s certainly a competent
[3118.96s] operator as it relates to tough times in
[3121.359s] the US. I think that&#39;s a very difficult
[3124.079s] statement to justify based on the
[3126.8s] numbers presently. You know, we just
[3128.48s] came off earnings season. We had 12.8%
[3131.839s] earnings growth. The negative GDP
[3134.319s] headline that people are referencing was
[3136.24s] a lot of pull forward from uh imports.
[3139.52s] You know, C plus I plus G plus X X being
[3142.4s] net exports. Um that that took off about
[3146.4s] 3 percentage points. So barring that
[3148.4s] pull forward where we basically had 3%
[3150.8s] economic growth. Uh now if if we go
[3154.8s] another 2 3 months with no reasonable
[3157.68s] trade deals then we then we could
[3159.28s] potentially have a problem. And honestly
[3161.44s] given Bergkshire&#39;s cash position that
[3163.92s] would be the best thing ever that could
[3165.44s] happen to Bergkshire. But I I really
[3167.04s] don&#39;t foresee it happening that uh we
[3170.079s] what we&#39;ve seen so far is we have a
[3172.64s] Trump put. They&#39;ve they&#39;ve shown
[3174.319s] flexibility to pause. uh they&#39;ve shown
[3177.119s] flexibility with different industries,
[3179.04s] the auto industry to do certain
[3180.96s] carveouts for the auto suppliers uh and
[3183.92s] and the rigidity that started with quote
[3186.319s] unquote liberation day has kind of
[3188.28s] ameliated. So that&#39;s given the market
[3190.48s] some level of comfort. Earnings guidance
[3193.52s] while it&#39;s come down about 3.6% 6% for
[3197.96s] 2025. It&#39;s held in for 2026 at $32 on
[3202.319s] the S&amp;P, which implies we&#39;re trading at
[3204.64s] about 18.5 times next year&#39;s earnings
[3207.839s] compared to the 10-year average of 18.3
[3209.92s] times. So, the economy is generally
[3211.76s] strong, which is kind of their problem.
[3214.0s] Uh, unless things get really bad,
[3216.0s] they&#39;re going to have a hard time
[3217.44s] finding a big enough business to buy to
[3220.0s] move the needle at good prices. And that
[3222.8s] that&#39;s been the problem for a long time.
[3225.28s] Much easier to find smaller subscale
[3228.0s] businesses when you&#39;re running 10 or 20
[3229.68s] or 30 billion than when you got uh a
[3233.2s] $1.1 trillion company. So the days of uh
[3236.96s] the little one-offs like Seas Candy and
[3239.359s] Dairy Queen and uh the gas stations and
[3242.88s] Hellsburg Diamonds and Omaha Furniture
[3245.44s] Mart uh are behind them. They really
[3247.92s] need something big. and uh and you know
[3250.96s] there it&#39;s it&#39;s hard to say that that&#39;s
[3253.2s] in the immediate future. Yeah, he&#39;s got
[3256.319s] uh not just big shoes to fill but a
[3258.24s] pretty challenging front to tackle as
[3260.4s] well. Uh Thomas, we&#39;ll leave it there.
[3262.319s] Uh it&#39;s the end of an era, start of a
[3264.4s] new one hopefully for Burkshire
[3265.839s] Hathaway. Thomas, uh it&#39;s been great to
[3268.4s] have you uh to chat with us this
[3270.559s] morning. Really appreciate it and surely
[3272.64s] not going to be our last one with you.
[3274.319s] Thank you very much Andrea. I appreciate
[3275.68s] it. And Haranto as well. That&#39;s Thomas
[3277.839s] Hayes. He&#39;s chairman and managing member
[3279.68s] at Grit Hill Capital. And we&#39;re back.
[3282.88s] And then finally, this one was all the
[3286.319s] way last Thursday
[3288.559s] uh when we And to break down these
[3290.88s] results, we have Thomas Hayes, chairman
[3292.72s] and managing member at Great Hill
[3294.96s] Capital. Thomas, thanks for your time
[3296.64s] today. So, let&#39;s start with Microsoft
[3298.96s] because the initial concern was that
[3300.96s] there was a slowdown when it came to
[3303.44s] data center leases, but that&#39;s not what
[3305.52s] we saw. We&#39;re seeing increased spending.
[3307.68s] in fact increased demand for its cloud
[3309.92s] division. Uh does this put concerns of
[3312.559s] overspending, overinvestment and even
[3315.839s] slowing AI demand behind us?
[3319.92s] Well, they absolutely crushed earnings,
[3321.599s] Sarah, and to your point, they raised
[3324.16s] revenue guidance by $1.25 billion.
[3327.599s] They&#39;re expecting Azure growth, the
[3329.44s] cloud growth of 34 to 35% after hitting
[3332.68s] 33% this quarter. So all the concerns
[3335.68s] and all the rumors about leases being
[3338.0s] cancelled etc were in vain. Uh revenues
[3341.44s] were up 13% versus 8% expectations.
[3344.64s] Earnings were up 18% versus 10%
[3347.0s] expectations and guidance was strong. So
[3349.92s] this is in line with what we&#39;re seeing
[3351.76s] so far in earnings season which is
[3354.0s] earnings are up 10.1%.
[3356.799s] And that&#39;s why when we saw the Atlanta
[3359.119s] GDP now had been predicting
[3362.68s] -2.7% GDP, we thought it was a little
[3365.28s] bit uh ridiculous. I mean GDP did come
[3368.4s] in
[3369.24s] at.3% but as you referenced Sarah that
[3372.48s] was uh uh mostly due to inventory
[3375.599s] building ahead of tariffs. X that
[3378.0s] inventory building, we would have had
[3379.839s] positive GDP growth of about 3%. Yeah,
[3383.04s] we&#39;ll we&#39;ll get to the GDP more in a
[3385.28s] bit, but I want to get to Meta as well
[3387.599s] because they posted strong advertising
[3390.319s] revenue and and that&#39;s despite concerns
[3392.72s] over tariffs and and what these tariffs
[3395.52s] can do when it comes to corporate
[3397.44s] spending. Uh what does that earnings
[3400.319s] results tell us about the potential drag
[3403.119s] uh that that tariff uncertainty and
[3405.2s] volatility would have on the corporate
[3407.04s] sector?
[3409.839s] Yeah, well the ad revenue was the big
[3411.599s] question mark. People were a little
[3412.96s] worried about consumer sentiment etc.
[3415.52s] came in 41.3 billion of revenue versus
[3419.04s] 40.4 billion estimated unlike Microsoft
[3422.72s] which which raised revenue guidance. uh
[3425.68s] Meta&#39;s guidance was in line with
[3428.24s] expectations and some of that is due to
[3429.92s] the fact that 10% of their ad revenue
[3432.319s] comes from Chinese sellers in the US and
[3435.2s] that&#39;s probably going to uh go away a
[3437.119s] little bit in the second quarter. So
[3438.799s] they had to take that guidance down but
[3440.4s] overall very solid very solid on the
[3443.04s] daily active users 3.43 billion versus
[3446.76s] 3.39 billion estimates. So all in all I
[3450.16s] mean earnings 6.43 43 versus
[3453.079s] $524 estimate. Revenues 42.3 billion
[3456.88s] versus 41.4. Uh really really good and
[3460.4s] alleviated a lot of fears in the market
[3462.319s] and I think you&#39;re going to see some
[3463.44s] follow-through with this positivity
[3465.28s] after market. Yeah. And we briefly
[3468.079s] talked about GDP. They&#39;re shrinking for
[3470.64s] the first quarter and they&#39;re not
[3473.2s] concerns about stagflation. Of course,
[3475.76s] uh President Trump blaming it on his
[3477.92s] predecessor. Some analysts are are
[3480.24s] attributing this to front loing. Uh but
[3482.96s] what do you think about about the
[3484.4s] numbers and what does this tell us about
[3486.0s] the path ahead for the US economy?
[3490.4s] Well, I think the negative is a positive
[3492.88s] in the sense that it brings in three
[3495.599s] puts on the market. Number one, you have
[3497.359s] the Trump put. Uh on April 8th, he said,
[3500.4s] &quot;Now&#39;s the time to buy the market.&quot; That
[3502.24s] was the bottom of the market that day.
[3504.16s] Today, he came out and said, &quot;Be
[3505.92s] patient. America will boom. So, you
[3509.04s] know, Trump is now watching the markets.
[3510.88s] Then you have these three numbers that
[3512.799s] were weak today. The GDP was weak, the
[3515.079s] ADP job numbers, 62K versus 120K was
[3519.76s] weak. And inflation came in the lowest
[3522.96s] since November. The PCE prices uh at
[3526.2s] 2.3%. So, those three things bring back
[3529.2s] in the Fed put and we&#39;re now pricing in
[3532.799s] about a 65% chance of a cut in June. And
[3536.72s] then the final put was the Treasury came
[3539.2s] out with an announcement that they&#39;re
[3541.2s] looking to enhance their Treasury
[3543.44s] buyback program to lower long-term
[3547.04s] lending costs, i.e. bring down the yield
[3549.76s] on the long end of the Treasury curve.
[3552.24s] And that is very very constructive for
[3554.079s] the economy. So, what&#39;s bad is good. Uh
[3556.72s] our earnings have been very very solid.
[3559.04s] Guidance has been pretty good. These
[3560.96s] economic numbers bring the Fed back into
[3563.359s] play and the most important thing will
[3565.2s] be the jobs report on Friday to see how
[3567.599s] that labor&#39;s market labor market is
[3569.92s] doing and how quickly the Fed is going
[3571.76s] to step in. Yeah. So now it sounds like
[3574.72s] you are waiting for more support from
[3576.799s] from the Fed and the Treasury. Thomas,
[3579.2s] will that be enough though to carry the
[3580.799s] US markets higher forward? Even with
[3583.68s] this backdrop of uncertainty and
[3585.559s] volatility, how much room do you think
[3588.079s] Wall Street can go higher from here?
[3592.16s] Okay, so what we had on April 8th and
[3595.119s] April 9th was record selling at the
[3598.4s] lowest point when the market was down
[3600.28s] 19% by hedge funds and CTAs. What&#39;s
[3604.72s] basically happened is they are now we&#39;ve
[3606.799s] had this rebound about halfway rebound
[3609.359s] they are praying for a retest of those
[3612.64s] lows and praying rarely works when it
[3615.68s] comes to investing. So, as the market
[3618.16s] pushes higher, maybe it&#39;s going to be uh
[3620.4s] more earnings, but I think it&#39;s going to
[3621.839s] be deal announcements, trade deal
[3624.359s] announcements. All of these people that
[3626.48s] got short at the exact wrong time are
[3628.48s] going to be forced buyers in coming
[3631.359s] weeks as we get deal announcements. And
[3633.599s] that&#39;s going to probably be the surprise
[3635.28s] of coming weeks is that while everyone&#39;s
[3637.52s] skeptical and some of the the economic
[3639.44s] numbers are slowing a bit is that you
[3641.92s] have forced buyers who basically sold at
[3644.16s] the exact wrong time that are going to
[3645.52s] have to get in and chase once we get
[3647.52s] some positive news across the tape as it
[3649.28s] relates to trade deals. Yeah, and we&#39;ll
[3651.52s] watch that closely when it happens.
[3652.88s] Thomas, appreciate you. Now, this is
[3654.24s] today Thomas Hayes there, chairman and
[3656.16s] managing member at Great Tail Capital.
[3658.24s] talking about earnings, but the most
[3659.52s] important part of this, even if you want
[3660.799s] to fast forward, is the last minute and
[3663.04s] a half when I was talking about forced
[3666.079s] buyers. And that proved to be really
[3668.4s] preient, especially considering what
[3669.92s] happened today. So, listen in here. And
[3672.64s] we&#39;re back. And on that one, just want
[3674.319s] to thank Audrey Tay and Sarah Ali for
[3678.559s] having me on that. Reuters, I want to
[3681.599s] thank uh them for including me in their
[3683.76s] article here last week about the stock
[3686.4s] market. And then on to our quotes of the
[3691.0s] week, we had
[3694.24s] uh Warren Buffett here. You do things
[3696.079s] when the opportunities come along. I&#39;ve
[3697.599s] had periods in my life when I&#39;ve had a
[3698.96s] bundle of ideas come along and I&#39;ve had
[3700.48s] long dry spells. If I get an idea next
[3702.559s] week, I&#39;ll do something. If not, I won&#39;t
[3704.0s] do a damn thing. And this is what
[3705.76s] Buffett calls the no strikes rule. You
[3707.76s] can stand at the plate. In baseball,
[3709.599s] they call strikes if you stand there and
[3711.28s] do nothing. Uh in investing, they can
[3714.48s] throw it down the middle. You don&#39;t have
[3716.16s] to swing. you can wait till the very
[3717.92s] fattest knuckle ball that you can knock
[3719.76s] out of the park. And that&#39;s what we try
[3721.52s] to do here. And we learned that from the
[3723.2s] master himself, a hero to me, Warren
[3725.599s] Buffett. Seth Clarman. Value investing
[3728.079s] requires a great deal of hard work,
[3729.68s] unusually strict discipline, and a
[3731.92s] long-term investment horizon. Few are
[3734.88s] willing and able to devote sufficient
[3736.64s] time and effort to become value
[3738.079s] investors, and only a fraction of those
[3740.079s] have the proper mindset to succeed.
[3742.0s] That&#39;s from Seth Clarin. Uh, you know,
[3743.92s] it&#39;s interesting. People are asking me
[3745.28s] like, &quot;Wow, you must be so excited about
[3747.28s] Cooper Standard.&quot; I got to be honest
[3749.44s] with you, uh, I was more excited about
[3752.64s] Cooper Standard when I was buying it in
[3754.96s] the low fives in May of
[3757.96s] 2022 than I am today because I knew that
[3761.599s] what you&#39;re seeing today was going to be
[3763.599s] happening whether it took 2 years, 3
[3765.92s] years, four years, 5 years. So yes, it&#39;s
[3768.559s] a five bagger off our initial basis. So
[3771.04s] far, we believe it&#39;s just getting
[3772.799s] started. It&#39;s only crediting at this
[3775.28s] stage. It&#39;s giving you credit for, you
[3778.24s] know, under $2 of earnings. Uh uh
[3782.0s] getting ahead of itself. We think that
[3784.079s] if the execution goes right and what we
[3786.72s] heard about the tariffs and everything
[3788.16s] else, uh, not only can it match what it
[3790.559s] did in 2017 earning $7.19 a share, but
[3795.44s] we also think that
[3799.039s] um because of all the costs that they&#39;ve
[3801.2s] taken out of the business that it could
[3803.039s] potentially earn more this cycle. So,
[3805.119s] there&#39;s a lot of gas in the tank. uh you
[3808.079s] know, you can you can manage your
[3809.68s] position as it continues to go up. But
[3812.88s] um it for me honestly the red days when
[3816.319s] I got to buy more were far more exciting
[3818.319s] than seeing happen what we knew was
[3821.92s] going to happen before we entered the
[3823.52s] position and uh and more good things to
[3825.92s] come. So uh very grateful for that.
[3828.319s] Next, my idea of a great business is one
[3830.319s] that has a shortage of competitors.
[3831.839s] Peter Lynch, you know that that&#39;s what
[3833.52s] everyone was worried about with the
[3834.48s] tariffs. I&#39;m like, who&#39;s going to stand
[3835.599s] up the billion dollar factory to replace
[3837.52s] Cooper Standard if they get destroyed
[3838.96s] because of tariffs? Like, think about
[3840.4s] this, guys. It&#39;s about share. Everyone&#39;s
[3842.96s] going to have to deal with the same set
[3844.48s] of conditions and the underlying demand
[3846.559s] for the cars is not going to change 13
[3848.72s] years, etc., etc. We&#39;ve covered it all.
[3850.96s] Um, moving along, let&#39;s go through some
[3853.839s] data and charts. We&#39;ve got a ton of them
[3855.52s] this week. Uh, first off, customer
[3859.119s] consumer balance sheet.
[3861.839s] Um you can see that uh by the way this
[3866.319s] was uh this is from one of the major
[3868.079s] banks through Seth Golden posted it on
[3870.72s] his website on his Twitter. Uh you can
[3873.44s] see all the assets that the consumer
[3877.359s] balance sheet has 190 trillion uh versus
[3880.24s] the liabilities at 20 trillion. So you
[3883.68s] can see that they are very very well
[3885.76s] capitalized and this this creates a lot
[3888.64s] of space as Bessant gets the 10-year
[3892.0s] yield down and people can start to draw
[3894.64s] on that equity home equity lines again.
[3898.0s] Uh you&#39;re going to see massive massive
[3900.24s] consumer opportunities with cars, with
[3903.039s] houses, with everything else. Uh average
[3905.28s] S&amp;P stock trades at an extreme discount
[3907.28s] to the cap weighted S&amp;P 500 index. Uh,
[3910.24s] all this says in English is there&#39;s so
[3912.64s] much to do right here. Yes, a lot of our
[3915.68s] stocks have taken off. Look, I I love
[3918.0s] Boeing. Boeing&#39;s up 50% in a couple of
[3921.2s] weeks and no one&#39;s paying attention.
[3922.96s] Those are the best movers when no one&#39;s
[3925.359s] paying attention after it&#39;s moved so
[3926.799s] much because it got so hated and
[3928.16s] forgotten. I mean, I was pounding the
[3930.079s] table on Varnney for weeks. Disney, same
[3933.2s] thing. They just beat it&#39;s starting to
[3934.799s] fly again.
[3936.28s] Um, these are the best ones when they
[3938.799s] fly and no one cares about it. Uh, and
[3941.039s] we&#39;re seeing more and more of that. So,
[3943.039s] um, so that&#39;s
[3944.28s] that. Uh, here is the Quen model versus
[3949.359s] Open AAI, Deep Seek, Gro 3, Gemini 2.5,
[3953.92s] Open AI, all the versions. And you can
[3956.079s] see that uh, Quen, Alibaba&#39;s AI models
[3961.2s] blow the doors off. Open AI, Deepseek,
[3965.039s] Grock, and Gemini on every single
[3968.4s] metric. It&#39;s not even a competition.
[3971.28s] It&#39;s like putting up a McLaren against a
[3974.0s] Miata. It&#39;s like no one even needs to go
[3976.16s] to the race. You know what the outcome&#39;s
[3977.68s] going to be. Average home and I continue
[3979.92s] to say cheapest AI play in the world. Uh
[3983.68s] to reiterate, as we have for the last
[3985.76s] eight consecutive weeks, we now own 100%
[3988.88s] of our stock in Hong Kong, ticker 9988.
[3992.88s] uh not because we think the the
[3996.319s] administration is going to torch $800
[3998.24s] billion dollars of investment capital.
[3999.839s] That would be far too stupid for any
[4001.359s] rational administration to do. Uh but
[4004.4s] just in
[4005.559s] case just in case uh it happens, we&#39;re
[4010.4s] covered. We still have derivative
[4011.92s] exposure in the US and we&#39;re 100
[4013.76s] willing% willing to uh take 100% of that
[4017.44s] risk because we can&#39;t replicate it. and
[4020.079s] uh any derivative position we go into,
[4022.48s] we&#39;re willing to take that because the
[4024.0s] expected value is so high and it&#39;s
[4025.599s] positioned accordingly etc. So there&#39;s
[4027.92s] still risk on the derivative side. We
[4029.76s] can live with that anyway because the
[4032.0s] equities will uh appreciate well more to
[4034.88s] compensate. So uh and we don&#39;t we think
[4037.359s] again it&#39;s a low probability. We go
[4039.2s] through this song and dance every two
[4041.599s] years. Average home builder incentive as
[4043.839s] a percentage of sales price. Just like
[4045.92s] cars, as incentives go up, so do
[4047.92s] volumes. The same thing is happening.
[4050.079s] Biggest four-week VIX declines and
[4051.92s] forward S&amp;P 500 returns. So, you can see
[4055.119s] we&#39;ve had a huge
[4057.599s] uh VIX crush, which we talked about a
[4059.68s] few weeks ago on Vanney. And you can see
[4061.92s] the average return going out. One year
[4064.72s] is 16%, 3 years is 46, 5 years is 85,
[4069.359s] etc.
[4071.039s] 20 worst shipping quarters. We just had
[4073.52s] one in Q1. That should start to free up
[4076.799s] as more of these deals get announced.
[4078.4s] Like the UK deal today, share of
[4080.48s] accounts making minimum credit card
[4082.72s] payments rising. So, we did acknowledge
[4085.039s] this in one of the interviews that you
[4087.039s] are seeing some pressure at the lower
[4091.559s] end, but you have to keep in mind people
[4094.319s] still have jobs. So, when consumers have
[4096.239s] jobs, they spend. Uh, and part of this
[4099.12s] is a function of rates. They got all
[4101.44s] this debt taken out in 2021 when rates
[4103.679s] were basically zero. So, you know, the
[4105.759s] banks are going to have to eat some of
[4106.799s] that. It&#39;s just the way it goes. Uh,
[4109.199s] United States international arrivals is
[4111.359s] tanking. That&#39;s tourism on the basis of
[4113.359s] what&#39;s happened. That will rebound very,
[4115.279s] very quickly as deals get signed. I can
[4117.12s] already see the the Brits getting on the
[4119.359s] airplane to come visit New York. Uh, so
[4122.48s] that&#39;s that. And as the dollar weakens,
[4126.0s] you are going to see an
[4128.92s] absolute
[4131.159s] unbelievable abundance of tourism in the
[4133.92s] United States. Uh as the dollar
[4135.6s] continues to weaken, US real personal
[4137.759s] consumption
[4139.96s] expenditures.
[4141.88s] Uh bad data is bad news. Dismal years
[4146.64s] for stocks. All right. So this is trying
[4148.239s] to make a bare case except it&#39;s already
[4149.839s] happened. So it&#39;s rearview mirror
[4151.279s] looking. dollar remains overvalued on a
[4153.759s] long-term valuation metrics. That is
[4155.92s] correct. We do believe the dollar is
[4158.08s] going to trend down for some time. Uh
[4160.96s] however, because everyone&#39;s getting
[4162.719s] bearish on the dollar now and you saw
[4164.4s] the covers of the economist and baronss
[4166.4s] etc. We do think you get a counter trend
[4168.719s] bounce in the short term uh just enough
[4171.799s] to uh force covering for the people who
[4176.239s] got short late. Hedge funds have gotten
[4178.319s] very short late after a huge move that
[4181.44s] once they get punished, it&#39;ll resume the
[4183.12s] downtrend and they cover. America&#39;s data
[4185.279s] center boom is largely being powered by
[4186.88s] gas and coal plants. That&#39;s why we have
[4188.96s] Commtock, which continues to rock and
[4191.52s] roll. I think it was up to $22 today. Uh
[4194.4s] we were pounding the table on this
[4195.92s] podcast at
[4197.239s] $89. Uh May is historically strong in a
[4201.199s] postelection year.
[4203.64s] uh
[4205.48s] uh kind of throw this out the window
[4208.32s] with this administration. Although it
[4210.48s] did sort of hold up with the exception
[4212.239s] of no, it didn&#39;t hold up. March and
[4214.56s] April were were down a lot. Uh and it
[4217.28s] should have been strong, but it was what
[4218.88s] it was. It&#39;s more than made up for it
[4220.48s] and will continue to do so. Data centers
[4222.96s] drive record surge in tech
[4225.32s] investment. Uh two-year trailing price
[4228.719s] returns.
[4233.52s] Uh Q2 Atlanta GDP now estimate is
[4238.679s] positive. So so far and that&#39;s probably
[4241.84s] why they&#39;re getting these deals done
[4243.28s] quickly and juicing the market because
[4245.52s] they don&#39;t want a negative wealth effect
[4247.28s] when people&#39;s portfolios go down they
[4248.96s] stop spending. If they keep the market
[4250.96s] up and people keep spending they won&#39;t
[4252.56s] get that second quarter of negative GDP
[4254.88s] growth which is a technical recession.
[4256.96s] So this is very critical that that stays
[4258.96s] positive. Um share of investment flows
[4262.159s] from mainland China into Hong Kong is
[4264.84s] growing very much in line with our
[4267.04s] original
[4267.8s] thesis. US fundamental long short
[4271.48s] uh ratio say so they are record short in
[4276.96s] the whole like we&#39;ve never seen.
[4280.44s] Um, and just as they were record long at
[4283.52s] the peak in 2021, which is why you&#39;re
[4286.4s] seeing all the forced buyers that we
[4288.239s] covered before the fact, both with CNA
[4292.159s] and with David Lynn. S&amp;P 500 versus
[4296.32s] Europe returns when US dollar is strong
[4298.719s] versus
[4299.8s] weak. Strong dollar, S&amp;P outperforms,
[4303.44s] weak dollar, everything else
[4304.64s] outperforms. That is the core of our
[4306.56s] thesis. That is what we&#39;ve been talking
[4308.08s] about for 6 months and that is why those
[4311.52s] of you who had listened outperformed
[4313.679s] everything in the first quarter with uh
[4317.56s] XUS 12 month housing price changes prior
[4320.8s] year versus most recent
[4322.76s] year. You can see the difference by
[4326.64s] region. Uh affordability is going up is
[4329.6s] the theme of that. China US exempt about
[4332.96s] a quarter of imports from tariffs.
[4336.48s] Estimated value of
[4340.36s] exemptions, US imports from
[4344.36s] China, China imports from US. So there&#39;s
[4346.96s] already some movement that already
[4349.04s] happened. We&#39;re obviously paying close
[4350.64s] attention to the talks in Geneva this
[4352.64s] weekend. Those will be crit critically
[4355.04s] important. You can see what&#39;s happened
[4356.8s] here just in the last few weeks. The
[4358.239s] percentage of S&amp;P 500 members above the
[4360.239s] 20-day moving average has skyrocketed
[4363.679s] weekly bound announce that&#39;s all the
[4365.44s] forced buyers that we warned were coming
[4368.08s] uh in a warned in a good way. Uh Q1
[4372.239s] earning season has seen a huge surge in
[4374.64s] buyback announcements to record highs.
[4377.04s] That&#39;s going to also help earnings.
[4378.719s] Retail investors bought the dip in line
[4380.96s] with other major volatility episodes yet
[4384.239s] again. And what I&#39;ve said is proven
[4386.159s] correct is that since COVID, retail
[4390.239s] investors have been right. They&#39;ve been
[4391.92s] buying on weakness and institutional
[4394.159s] investors and hedge funds have been
[4395.84s] wrong. They&#39;ve been selling at the exact
[4398.239s] wrong time. Cashlike ETFs head for
[4400.96s] record inflow in April. There you go.
[4403.52s] That&#39;s all going to be forced back into
[4405.12s] the market just when we&#39;re at the next
[4406.96s] shortterm top. More good news for the
[4409.6s] bulls. Uh this is from Carson returns
[4412.64s] after recovering 50% of the bare market
[4414.88s] 1950 to current. 6 months later up 10%
[4418.0s] 12 months later up
[4420.199s] 18%. Home prices versus
[4423.159s] affordability. You can see the price
[4425.44s] index is at an the biggest extreme since
[4428.64s] 2006 2007. Uh, I think this is going to
[4432.159s] get solved pretty quickly and we&#39;re
[4433.52s] going to cover it in the article of the
[4435.12s] week and talk about why and how impact
[4438.08s] that&#39;s going to be a theme for us moving
[4439.44s] forward is the home building recovery
[4442.64s] impact of policy uncertainty on S&amp;P 500
[4446.8s] cash use
[4448.96s] uh controlling for all other
[4454.76s] variables that was uh in the first
[4457.199s] quarter and then they&#39;ve and then they
[4458.96s] April reversals in the S&amp;P
[4461.96s] 500 was one of the biggest in history
[4466.08s] going back to
[4468.36s] 2001 which is a model that we&#39;ve used
[4470.96s] and co those were the only two bigger
[4473.92s] turnarounds in the month of April uh in
[4476.159s] the last 30 years and maybe maybe
[4478.159s] throughout history. US importers expect
[4480.32s] a double digit decline in import volume
[4482.159s] from May.
[4483.92s] Can&#39;t tell you how many clients have
[4485.84s] called me in the last week and said, &quot;Oh
[4489.76s] my god, I cannot
[4493.0s] believe
[4494.52s] how timely impression that special
[4498.08s] webinar you did for us was.&quot; It was
[4500.4s] literally a 35minute call for all my
[4502.32s] money management clients. Um, the day
[4505.04s] before Trump put out that now&#39;s the time
[4507.76s] to buy stocks. Actually, it was two days
[4509.6s] because if I remember, Trump put that
[4511.36s] out on Thursday and I put out the
[4514.48s] podcast, the the webinar for clients,
[4517.08s] maybe Monday or Tuesday night. Anyway, I
[4520.8s] just said to them, if you ever thinking
[4522.48s] about adding more money, now is the
[4525.12s] time. The last time I told you guys to
[4527.12s] do this was October 2022 and a little
[4530.159s] bit in March of 2023, but really pounded
[4532.64s] the table. I never come on and say this.
[4534.88s] And so many of them took me up on it and
[4536.64s] they&#39;re calling me up. They&#39;re like, I
[4538.0s] can&#39;t believe it. I was my I was shaken
[4541.199s] to do it and like here we are. It&#39;s just
[4543.44s] been I&#39;m so excited for them. Uh and uh
[4547.36s] and those who hung through, you know, I
[4548.96s] didn&#39;t get any phone calls of people
[4550.159s] saying, &quot;Oh, what&#39;s what&#39;s going on?&quot; I
[4552.4s] got a couple, but not
[4554.199s] like not it was more like, &quot;Should I add
[4558.719s] more money, blah, blah, blah, etc.&quot; and
[4563.159s] um and they and every single one just ju
[4568.4s] I just best amazing clients suck it
[4571.12s] through and now you&#39;re just beginning to
[4573.36s] see the rewards like yeah Cooper Sanders
[4576.56s] doing great Boba&#39;s coming back great
[4579.04s] great great and and you know comtock all
[4581.76s] these others and the the P&amp;Ls are are
[4584.159s] just unbelievable
[4585.92s] um uh on a relative basis to everyone
[4588.4s] else
[4590.239s] But if you look by company by company
[4593.04s] based on the fundamentals that they&#39;ve
[4595.52s] reported, it it&#39;s like we&#39;ve got 10 more
[4598.96s] Cooper standards in our portfolio that
[4601.04s] haven&#39;t even begun yet. It&#39;s just beyond
[4603.679s] exciting right now. Uh is what I can
[4605.84s] say. That doesn&#39;t mean we won&#39;t get a
[4607.12s] pullback now that everyone&#39;s excited
[4608.56s] because we&#39;ve been up, you know, 10 days
[4610.0s] in a row, but um it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s pretty
[4615.28s] cool. Sellside, equity sentiment fell,
[4618.4s] so that&#39;s good.
[4620.159s] Uh no signs of selling for US
[4623.159s] stocks. Good increase in crowded stocks
[4626.48s] would have underperformed by 5% peranom
[4630.0s] since 2009. This is basically saying if
[4632.64s] you crowd into the most crowded trades
[4634.48s] like mag 7 eventually catches up with
[4637.12s] you and erases all the outperformance
[4638.88s] that you had in previous periods. We&#39;ve
[4640.8s] been that was a big table pounder coming
[4642.719s] into this year. Get the hell out of MAG7
[4645.28s] and that&#39;s proven to be preient. um long
[4648.159s] only funds exposure to cyclical and
[4649.76s] defensive sectors is near an all-time
[4652.44s] low. Uh that that what what does that
[4655.6s] mean? Uh consumer discretionary you
[4657.6s] think about uh VF corp you think about
[4661.04s] you know the Nikes of the world you
[4662.88s] think about materials at Albamar&#39;s
[4665.6s] industrials at Generax. Now, these
[4667.92s] things are going to get bid by the
[4669.44s] people who missed it. Uh are going to
[4672.159s] have to play catch-up. And we&#39;ve seen
[4673.6s] this game before, and it&#39;s just going to
[4675.12s] be violent to the upside for all the
[4677.84s] left behind stocks, which is exciting.
[4680.159s] Cash near
[4681.48s] low. Uh 67%. Okay, we&#39;ll cover earnings
[4685.12s] at the end. Earnings have been amazing
[4687.12s] this
[4688.44s] quarter and guidance a lot better than
[4692.12s] expected. Project delay mentions start
[4694.4s] to pick up, but still well below COVID
[4696.4s] levels. So that is understandable and
[4699.44s] that&#39;s the risk, the lagged effect of
[4701.199s] that. But I think now with this real
[4704.08s] concrete deal announced, people are
[4705.84s] going to say, &quot;We know what direction
[4707.44s] they&#39;re headed. We should probably
[4709.36s] invest while there&#39;s still some level of
[4711.04s] uncertainty so we can get a little bit
[4712.56s] of a discount in doing
[4716.04s] so.&quot; Consensus sees growth spread
[4718.88s] between the Magnificent 7 and other 493
[4721.52s] narrowing.
[4725.12s] So again, you continue to see a res
[4728.0s] resurgence in the X-Mag 7 and a
[4730.96s] significant deceleration in earnings
[4732.8s] growth in the MAG 7. That was the core
[4735.199s] tenant to our thesis going into the
[4737.719s] year. Uh S&amp;P 500&#39;s longest winning
[4740.8s] streak since 2004. So one more thing
[4744.08s] pointing to the early 2000s, which has
[4746.56s] been key part of our theme for the last
[4749.28s] 6 months. Prime book global energy
[4753.6s] uh positive value equals net buying.
[4756.6s] So the world is pretty negative on
[4759.44s] energy stocks and I just am not at the
[4763.52s] point where it&#39;s a super fat other than
[4766.48s] what you know when we were buying com
[4768.159s] stock in the eights and nines and
[4769.679s] pounding the table on the podcast.
[4771.52s] There&#39;s nothing there that is just pound
[4774.56s] the table I can&#39;t get enough of easy
[4777.199s] double over three years. Um, and there
[4780.56s] are a few, but they&#39;re just not quality
[4782.239s] enough for me to want to risk capital
[4784.0s] there. So, I continue to pay attention
[4785.6s] to it. I think there&#39;s going to be a
[4786.88s] violent move. We will participate
[4788.48s] through uh com stock resources, but
[4790.96s] maybe maybe we&#39;ll get one more in before
[4792.719s] it goes. And maybe we won&#39;t. But, you
[4795.12s] know, it is what it is. Uh, I got to
[4797.199s] find something that&#39;s a slam dunk dunk
[4798.88s] where my downside is protected. And
[4800.88s] that&#39;s the problem with a lot of energy.
[4802.239s] Your downside&#39;s not protected under $50.
[4804.8s] And the uh upside&#39;s at least a double to
[4807.12s] to a triple over you know 2 3 4 years
[4810.48s] and I&#39;m just not finding that yet. So
[4814.36s] um sector fund
[4817.4s] flows you can see it
[4819.719s] there. Uh Buffett how he crushed it for
[4823.44s] decades performance against icon. So he
[4825.92s] basically had 19.9 you know 5 and a half
[4829.679s] million% returns. But what that worked
[4831.84s] out to on an annual basis uh is about
[4835.48s] 19.9% returns versus the S&amp;P which was
[4839.12s] whatever 10 12% so almost double the
[4842.6s] S&amp;P. Um and if you really have studied
[4846.96s] him and know it wasn&#39;t so much cuz 3% of
[4851.12s] his investment decisions actually move
[4852.96s] the needle. Uh which is amazing when you
[4855.6s] think about it.
[4857.159s] Um the biggest thing he did was avoid
[4860.8s] the mistakes. Okay? So he didn&#39;t play in
[4864.88s] the tech bubble in 2000 when everyone
[4867.6s] said has Buffett lost his touch, he has
[4869.28s] no tech exposure, etc.
[4871.56s] Um and um so so he avoided that and by
[4875.52s] avoiding those huge 80 and 90% draw
[4877.92s] downs nifty50 in the 70s tech wreck uh
[4881.6s] you know huge exposure to housing during
[4884.56s] the great financial crisis
[4886.36s] and by avoiding those mistakes is how he
[4889.679s] really got the dramatic outperformance
[4891.6s] over time. It wasn&#39;t because every
[4893.12s] decision he made was right because again
[4895.6s] a few percentage made up the bulk of his
[4898.0s] good decisions. So, uh, short interest
[4900.48s] very high on the Russell 2000. Do not
[4902.32s] give up on short caps. They&#39;re just
[4903.76s] starting to go. Uh, that&#39;s going to be a
[4905.92s] huge second half, uh, beneficiary, uh,
[4909.36s] that we will benefit from. Healthc care
[4911.6s] versus staples price.
[4914.17s] [Music]
[4915.88s] Uh, so you got healthcare versus staple
[4919.719s] revisions and then you got price.
[4925.159s] So healthc care is a space obviously we
[4928.48s] have Baxter we&#39;ve got uh biotech back
[4931.199s] basket XBI I think those are also going
[4933.6s] to be great back half plays uh many
[4936.56s] categories of retailer two months or
[4939.12s] less of inventory so you&#39;ll have some
[4940.719s] more restocking there Trump&#39;s first term
[4943.44s] public
[4947.48s] comments public comments on Fed policy
[4950.0s] led to modestly lower rates pricing okay
[4953.44s] interesting Business confidence and
[4955.199s] capital spending expectations have
[4956.639s] collapsed in the last two months. That&#39;s
[4958.239s] going to start to resurge in the next 4
[4959.84s] to 8 weeks. Uh main street meter, that&#39;s
[4963.679s] US consumer confidence
[4968.28s] index divided by US labor employment
[4971.44s] rate. So you&#39;ve seen a little bit of
[4973.36s] drop off in that recently. So it&#39;s
[4975.199s] something to keep an eye on. Looks a
[4976.96s] little bit like 92. Looks a little bit
[4980.48s] by like 2003.
[4985.88s] Um and uh so so that&#39;s that we&#39;ve
[4990.0s] covered the difference between the hard
[4991.36s] data and the soft data. What people are
[4993.84s] saying is they&#39;re despondent. What
[4996.32s] people are doing is they&#39;re euphoric.
[4998.159s] They&#39;re spending and they&#39;re going out
[4999.92s] and they&#39;re partying like uh like
[5001.76s] there&#39;s no tomorrow.
[5010.159s] What they&#39;re talking about here is the
[5013.6s] average annualized forward one-year and
[5016.159s] three-year total returns 1955 to
[5019.719s] 2025 when sentiment gets this low into
[5023.04s] the bottom quintile. And your forward
[5026.239s] three-year average annual S&amp;P
[5030.6s] return total return is 14.3% per year
[5034.8s] when when sentiment gets this low and
[5039.719s] um forward one-year
[5043.239s] return is 17%. Okay, so you get a huge
[5048.159s] snapback when sentiment gets this low.
[5056.719s] Lot of bets on tariffs falling in China.
[5058.8s] That&#39;s pretty obvious. Trump talked
[5060.08s] about it
[5061.32s] today. Chart of the day. Where are the
[5063.6s] inventories? Retailers currently hold
[5065.76s] about 35 days of inventory, which is
[5067.52s] near the record low scene during COVID.
[5070.96s] So, they&#39;re going to have to rebuild
[5072.0s] those inventories. That&#39;s going to be a
[5074.4s] potential issue if we see the backups.
[5078.239s] But I don&#39;t think it&#39;ll be as hard to
[5081.199s] get back online quickly as it was during
[5083.52s] those periods. Uh it&#39;s just we need to
[5086.639s] see a little bit of progress this
[5087.76s] weekend in Geneva. That will be helpful.
[5089.84s] China cuts key rate reserve ratio to aid
[5092.4s] economy hit by tariffs. Cumulative US
[5094.96s] net trader flow. Uh you&#39;re seeing some a
[5098.88s] lot of selling in staples, a lot of
[5100.719s] buying in financials.
[5108.0s] That&#39;s in the last 20
[5110.92s] days. Uh you could see here when I
[5113.52s] always joke about Comarmac, they
[5115.52s] delivered 13 planes last
[5118.36s] year. Um Boeing on the other hand is
[5121.28s] going to do 448 this
[5123.48s] year. Airbus is going to do over
[5126.36s] 600. Over the next between now and 2034,
[5130.32s] Boeing&#39;s going to deliver 6,200. Airbus
[5133.239s] 8,400.
[5134.92s] Comac 780. So the Chinese need Boeing
[5138.32s] like a diabetic needs
[5142.44s] insulin. S&amp;P 500 revenue from China is
[5145.679s] roughly four times the US trade deficit
[5148.96s] with China. This is a chart that the
[5151.92s] Chinese should probably bring to the
[5153.36s] table. Uh the S&amp;P 500 companies get 1
[5158.8s] almost 1.2 2 trillion dollar of revenue
[5163.12s] from China. Uh the US trade deficit with
[5166.88s] China is only $295
[5169.88s] billion. So something to keep in
[5179.719s] mind. Longest private client buying
[5182.48s] streak in our data history. This is from
[5185.6s] Bank of America. So uh again the retail
[5188.88s] investors came in and started buying
[5191.52s] stocks. Uh S&amp;P EPS versus the Fed EPS
[5196.32s] breath suggests that the Fed should be
[5197.84s] in cutting mode, not pausing. They are
[5201.84s] too restrictive. Let&#39;s see how things
[5204.08s] look between now and June. I think if
[5207.28s] the inflation number stays subdued, they
[5209.44s] are going to be cutting for sure in
[5211.679s] June.
[5215.04s] also have to watch the labor numbers. If
[5216.88s] they get one week report where the
[5220.0s] unemployment rate goes from 42 to 44, uh
[5223.36s] I think you&#39;ll definitely see a cut in
[5225.28s] June, which will be a Goldilocks type of
[5227.8s] scenario. Firsttime home buyers in age
[5230.8s] group 26 to 34 is
[5234.199s] 71%. Median age of US home buyers has
[5238.08s] gone up to 38.
[5241.92s] US dollar underperformed FX majors in
[5244.159s] the first 100 days. All the other major
[5247.36s] currencies were up. Uh euro up 10%, US
[5251.199s] dollar down 9%, British pound up 10%.
[5254.56s] That was a key theme we were pounding
[5256.08s] the table on in Q4. That has begun to
[5259.44s] play out. Four-year average and share
[5262.08s] buybacks versus the S&amp;P 500 got very,
[5264.56s] very negative early in the year. now has
[5266.96s] spiked
[5275.08s] positive. Retail buying of US doiciled
[5278.08s] EU ADRs and Europe focused ETFs is gone
[5282.56s] straight
[5283.719s] up. 30-year fixed mortgage
[5286.679s] rates versus purchase mortgage
[5289.6s] applications index. You can see how this
[5293.719s] resolves as rates come down, purchase
[5296.48s] mortgage applications go through the
[5298.639s] roof. We saw the exact same thing in
[5301.52s] 2020 through
[5303.56s] 2022. Uh and then going back a little
[5306.32s] bit to
[5308.84s] 2013. Stock buyback set to blow past 1
[5311.84s] trillion for the first time this year.
[5313.84s] That&#39;s been in the last couple of weeks.
[5315.36s] That is a sign of confidence. That is a
[5317.92s] sea change.
[5320.08s] uh US trade deficit
[5322.679s] is in goods and services as of March
[5326.32s] 31st has gone to a record. That&#39;s what
[5329.28s] they&#39;re doing here. You can see the
[5331.12s] dollar versus the 10-year yield. 10-year
[5333.36s] yield should start to follow the dollar
[5336.239s] pretty aggressively down ex, you know,
[5339.199s] again, when the 10-year yield was
[5341.52s] knocking on the door for five, we said
[5343.36s] it&#39;s going below four before it goes
[5345.76s] above five. everyone was certain it was
[5348.0s] going above five. Uh I think we&#39;re going
[5350.639s] to see 375 at some point this year and
[5353.679s] that&#39;s going to give us a high fives in
[5355.679s] the 30-year fixed mortgage and that is
[5358.88s] going to be a housing laooa as Charlie
[5362.639s] Munger would
[5371.719s] reference. Okay, so we just went below
[5374.32s] from below the 200. This is from Yurian
[5378.92s] Timmer back above the 200 day moving
[5381.6s] average. Okay, so that&#39;s has some
[5385.4s] significance. Auction demand remains
[5387.6s] healthy for
[5389.96s] treasuries. Breath narrowed a little bit
[5392.159s] in April. Only 40% of stocks outperform
[5394.239s] the S&amp;P 500, down from 60% in March. So
[5397.44s] something to keep an eye on. And moving
[5399.44s] along, Trump hails UK trade framework as
[5401.92s] the first of many tariff deals and
[5404.0s] Lutnik was on this afternoon saying the
[5405.92s] same. Dozens rolling out in the next uh
[5408.8s] couple of months. Trump says substantive
[5411.52s] China talks could yield a tariff cut. Uh
[5414.88s] that&#39;s a about face from what was said
[5417.679s] yesterday. Uh China cuts key rate
[5420.239s] reserve ratio to aid economy hit by
[5422.239s] tariffs. Bessent working on clear rules
[5424.639s] for US investment in China.
[5428.28s] Uh let&#39;s see. US2 overhaul curbs on AI
[5432.56s] chip exports after industry backlash. Uh
[5436.159s] so that&#39;s positive. Alibaba&#39;s Quen 3
[5438.88s] topples Deep Seek R1 as world&#39;s highest
[5442.96s] ranked open-source AI model. We covered
[5446.08s] that with the table. US China tariff
[5449.28s] pause reasonable to expect. Council
[5452.04s] says Alip Pay and WeChat Pay see booming
[5455.76s] inbound spending in China during Labor
[5458.719s] Day holiday. Uh preliminary data from
[5461.36s] the country&#39;s two dominant mobile
[5462.8s] payment apps show two to three times the
[5465.44s] spending from a year ago. Uh that is
[5468.08s] huge ladies and gentlemen. And speaking
[5470.56s] of which, Alibaba, if you remember, the
[5473.36s] tech crackdown started with the pulling
[5475.28s] of the Ant Financial IPO. Well, it looks
[5478.56s] like it&#39;s now going to go public in the
[5480.159s] next year. We own a third of that
[5481.92s] through our ownership in 9988, aka
[5485.48s] Alibaba. Chinese stocks look like an
[5487.679s] opportunity amid Trump&#39;s tariff chaos.
[5489.92s] You&#39;ll notice all the Baron&#39;s articles
[5491.76s] are being written by new authors. The
[5494.08s] lady who wrote 135 consecutive negative
[5497.04s] headlines about China is no longer uh I
[5500.4s] don&#39;t know if she&#39;s even with the
[5501.92s] company, but she&#39;s certainly not
[5503.679s] covering China anymore. Um, and I joked,
[5508.159s] uh, it was like having a Palestinian
[5510.639s] write articles about Israeli tech
[5512.48s] companies. It just didn&#39;t work. Uh, and,
[5515.6s] uh, so now we&#39;re getting more balanced,
[5517.92s] uh, opinion follows trend. Warren
[5520.159s] Buffett plans to step down as Bergkshire
[5521.92s] CEO at year end. We covered all of that.
[5525.28s] CEOs celebrate Warren Buffett as he
[5528.08s] calls close on a 5.5 million% run aka
[5532.6s] 19.9% a year compounded. Uh just
[5537.08s] absolute legend. Disney new theme park
[5540.56s] hot spot the Middle East. So this is was
[5543.44s] a big announcement this week in the
[5546.04s] UAE. US exports of natural gas liquids
[5549.04s] touch record high in April. That was
[5552.0s] part of our original
[5554.12s] comtock thesis and more of that&#39;s to
[5556.8s] come because that&#39;s going to be part of
[5558.0s] the EU trade negotiations. You take all
[5560.719s] of our natural gas, stop getting it from
[5562.8s] Russia. We will uh lower your tariffs to
[5566.56s] a more reasonable rate than our our
[5568.56s] opening offer. Hartnet over at Bank of
[5570.88s] America market now expecting Trump pivot
[5573.04s] to lower tar tariffs, lower rates, and
[5576.4s] lower taxes and lower regulation. by the
[5579.6s] way, and this is what we said uh in the
[5582.56s] middle of the chaos. Just watch. It&#39;s
[5585.28s] going to be one headline and then the
[5586.719s] focus is going to start to shift to
[5589.28s] growth, deregulation, tax cuts, etc. And
[5593.199s] we&#39;re going to be off to the races and
[5594.639s] you&#39;re going to missed it. And that&#39;s
[5596.08s] exactly what&#39;s starting to happen. US
[5598.239s] auto sales up 9.9% in April on rush
[5601.04s] demand, inventory decline, and price
[5602.719s] spikes concerns going forward. The big
[5605.36s] thing going forward is they&#39;re going to
[5606.4s] have to replenish all that inventory.
[5608.32s] Trump&#39;s auto tariff relief shields
[5610.28s] USCMCA auto parts from 25% tax. Um Jeff
[5614.56s] Edwards covered that in the Cooper
[5616.48s] Standard earnings call, which we&#39;ll
[5618.159s] touch on in the article of the week.
[5619.84s] Home builders are piling into discounts,
[5622.159s] piling on discounts as they struggle to
[5623.84s] entice buyers. Again, we want to be in
[5626.56s] the arms dealers, not the ones fighting
[5628.639s] the war. Both the home OEMs like PY, Dr.
[5632.96s] Horton, etc., and the car OEMs, Ford,
[5637.199s] GM, etc. They are all going to be
[5640.48s] producing massive volumes in a race to
[5643.12s] the bottom in margins. We want to
[5645.52s] benefit from from who are the players
[5648.239s] that are going to benefit from high
[5649.6s] volumes and not be affected by the OEM
[5652.0s] margins uh nearly as much and that is
[5655.28s] the uh building supply products like
[5657.48s] QXO, Brad Jacobs which we own and uh
[5662.719s] obviously the ancillary plays like
[5665.28s] Stanley Black &amp; Decker Generrack on the
[5667.199s] housing front and Cooper Standard on the
[5670.4s] auto front. Small cap stocks have
[5673.44s] suffered. It&#39;s time to be cautiously
[5675.159s] optimistic. Baron&#39;s greatest public
[5677.679s] business publication in history. Talking
[5679.92s] about advanced auto parts. So much for
[5683.52s] not a safe asset. Yields tumble after
[5686.0s] stellar 10-year Treasury auctions. Stops
[5688.56s] through on soaring direct demand. Okay,
[5691.84s] so the game is back on. Yields are going
[5694.159s] lower. Everything is falling into place.
[5696.96s] Venmo owned by PayPal obviously. And by
[5699.84s] the way, even PayPal starting to move
[5701.36s] now back over 70, gaining ground in
[5703.92s] payments as cash app struggles. I
[5706.88s] remember every single week when we
[5708.76s] initiated PayPal and then bought more in
[5711.44s] the high50s. Everyone was like, &quot;What
[5713.44s] about Block? Uh Cash App is so popular.&quot;
[5717.199s] I was like, &quot;It&#39;s a bag of you know
[5718.8s] what.&quot; Same thing I said about Pin Duo
[5721.04s] Duo. Uh and uh and that&#39;s now proving
[5724.08s] out in both cases. GXO secures 2.5
[5728.159s] billion NHS logistics contract. So even
[5731.679s] GXO is starting to rebound. And now on
[5734.56s] to our article of the week. New homes,
[5736.96s] new rides, stock market and sentiment
[5739.44s] results. Covered all the
[5741.48s] media. Cooper Standard. We&#39;re going to
[5743.52s] touch on some of the key points here.
[5745.12s] Obviously, it&#39;s had a huge move, some
[5747.04s] 70% in the last four sessions. Um, but
[5750.4s] it&#39;s not a mistake. Okay, the stock was
[5752.48s] down, you know, 98% give or take when we
[5755.52s] bought it and uh or
[5759.0s] 95%
[5760.679s] and no, probably 97% actually 146 down
[5764.4s] to five. Uh and by the way, as brilliant
[5766.96s] as we were buying in the fives uh when
[5769.12s] we started the position, it went to 385
[5771.76s] before it went before it&#39;s gone back up
[5774.08s] to 26 uh and started its recovery. But
[5778.56s] opin opinion follows trend but price
[5780.8s] follows fundamentals. Sooner or later uh
[5783.679s] the market is a weighing machine. In the
[5785.44s] short term it&#39;s a voting machine based
[5787.44s] on emotions. In the long term it&#39;s a
[5789.12s] weighing machine based on fundamentals.
[5791.679s] And the the stock price is not going up
[5794.04s] because you know a quote unquote short
[5796.56s] squeeze. That&#39;s part of it. They&#39;re the
[5798.08s] first buyers obviously. But it&#39;s going
[5800.32s] up because free cash flow is going up.
[5803.84s] Revenues are going up. their execution
[5806.48s] is going up, volumes are going up and uh
[5809.76s] and that&#39;s what you need to see.
[5811.199s] Adjusted Ibida went from 29 million last
[5814.32s] year to 58 million this year on
[5817.159s] effectively FX adjusted same revenues uh
[5821.28s] double the IBIDA. So they continue to
[5823.36s] execute negative 30 million uh loss last
[5827.76s] uh first quarter last year positive net
[5830.56s] income 3.5 million this year. Uh so you
[5835.52s] can see uh the huge impact of foreign
[5840.28s] exchange the variance here
[5843.84s] uh but the underlying business units is
[5846.719s] improving and the margins on each unit
[5849.119s] has dramatically improved both due to
[5851.52s] pricing both to execution both to cost
[5854.96s] cuts uh etc. So you can see there I
[5858.48s] think the most important thing here was
[5860.159s] number one they received a an award from
[5863.679s] Toyota and Toyota is a smart very small
[5866.639s] part of their business. Uh it looks like
[5869.28s] that&#39;s going to become a much larger
[5870.719s] part of the business and the reason
[5871.92s] that&#39;s important is because hybrids are
[5875.119s] the future and Toyota is very very good
[5877.6s] at hybrids. So, the fact that Toyota is
[5879.679s] awarding them with uh an amazing
[5882.719s] supplier excellence award shows that
[5885.44s] they&#39;re going to get a lot more new
[5887.679s] business awards from Toyota going
[5889.679s] forward. And Toyota is a leader in
[5893.4s] hybrids. And part of the reason they&#39;re
[5895.6s] a leader in hybrids is because when
[5897.92s] everyone else was following the herd
[5899.76s] into EVs, uh their CEO uh
[5904.28s] said it just doesn&#39;t make sense. and he
[5907.52s] held ground. They kicked him out and two
[5909.84s] years after he was out, everyone said,
[5911.119s] &quot;Oh, you were right.&quot; Uh, and uh, and
[5913.52s] they&#39;re just dominating. So, that&#39;s good
[5915.679s] to see that Cooper Standard&#39;s going to
[5918.719s] get a piece of that record liquidity
[5921.6s] that we&#39;ve seen in the last two years,
[5923.36s] $300 million between cash on hand of 140
[5927.199s] and uh, as and um, and their lending
[5930.08s] facility of 160.
[5935.52s] All the industry is moving towards
[5937.44s] hybrid basically in the US and that&#39;s
[5940.239s] they get
[5941.48s] 80% more per unit on a hybrid than they
[5945.04s] do on an IC and they get 20% more on an
[5948.56s] EV than they do on an ICE. So as the
[5952.159s] things trend which was not in our
[5953.76s] original model and is not in the 2017
[5956.0s] numbers. So when we talk about seven
[5958.32s] to10 dollars of earnings, that&#39;s really
[5960.0s] not accounting for what can happen if
[5962.719s] this mix continues to be positive, which
[5964.719s] is why
[5966.88s] um on the interview that I did with Jeff
[5968.96s] Edwards, he we emphasized variable
[5971.52s] contribution margin uh and he believes
[5974.8s] he can get to two times leverage uh from
[5977.679s] four and a half times even without a
[5980.52s] refinance. number one because of the
[5982.639s] execution and the cost cuts, but number
[5984.159s] two because the amount per car that
[5987.119s] they&#39;re making and going to continue to
[5989.28s] make as the mix shifts to more hybrids
[5992.32s] and EVs, but predominantly hybrids,
[5995.119s] further margin expansion. That&#39;s the
[5996.88s] story that he continues to pound the
[5999.36s] table on and he has for a year and a
[6001.04s] half as he promised to get back to
[6003.44s] double digit IBIDA margins, double digit
[6005.76s] return on invested capital and he is
[6007.92s] confident to deliver on that uh uh by
[6010.56s] the end of this year which is pretty
[6011.92s] exciting. It&#39;s always been a mñana
[6013.36s] story. Now it&#39;s a now story and the
[6015.44s] stock is starting to to reflect that. Uh
[6019.44s] CBS supplier of the
[6021.719s] year covered the
[6024.119s] Toyota increase hybrid consumption. We
[6026.639s] covered that. Ebida margins, we covered
[6029.4s] that. Uh management expects to mitigate
[6032.08s] or recover the vast majority of direct
[6033.92s] tariff impacts and does not view tariffs
[6035.84s] as significant cost headwing going
[6037.92s] forward. The vast majority of parts fall
[6040.32s] under the free trade umbrella, making
[6042.159s] tariffs much le less of a threat for
[6044.88s] Cooper Standard compared to other tier
[6046.639s] one suppliers. For the small amount that
[6048.8s] was paid, two about $2 million,
[6050.639s] management expects to be reimbursed by
[6052.56s] the
[6055.08s] OEMs. So far, management has seen no
[6057.679s] significant changes to Q2 compared to
[6059.679s] the original volume expectations with
[6061.6s] mix coming in more favorable due to
[6063.52s] higher truck and SUV production.
[6065.679s] Production schedules remain intact and
[6067.52s] with many OEMs offering favorable
[6069.28s] incentive plans like employee employee
[6071.199s] pricing through June, domestic
[6073.84s] inventories which were already 30% below
[6076.239s] historic averages continue to be
[6078.4s] depleted. Inventories will have to be
[6080.56s] replenished suggesting strong second
[6083.04s] half production
[6087.0s] outlook. Free cash flow was a net
[6089.44s] outflow of approximately 32 million in
[6091.36s] line with last year. However, Q1 has
[6093.76s] historically always been a working
[6095.119s] capital c outflow from a seasonality
[6097.6s] perspective. Cash and cash equivalents
[6099.44s] total 140 million, bringing total
[6101.04s] liquidity to 300 million. The EcoFlow
[6103.36s] switch pump recently won the Automotive
[6105.04s] News PACE pilot award, a key industry
[6107.28s] benchmark for emerging technologies
[6108.8s] management expects that as production of
[6110.639s] this technology ramps up and becomes
[6112.4s] fully commercialized, it will drive
[6113.679s] further profitable growth and expand the
[6115.719s] 80% cost per vehicle opportunity in
[6118.32s] hybrids even higher. This is key because
[6122.719s] it&#39;s a win-win. What they&#39;ve done with
[6124.56s] this EcoFlow switch pump is they&#39;ve
[6128.32s] reduced the amount of parts that the OEM
[6131.84s] needs. So, even though Cooper Standard
[6134.4s] is getting more money, um, the OEM is
[6139.679s] spending a less amount of money on that
[6143.44s] application. So effectively, Cooper
[6146.48s] Standards innovation has eliminated the
[6149.28s] need for them to
[6150.76s] buy ancillary parts from other
[6153.199s] suppliers. So they wind up spending less
[6156.08s] overall money, the OEMs, but they give
[6159.199s] all of that less money to Cooper
[6161.119s] Standard, which is more than Cooper
[6162.56s] Standard was getting to them before. So
[6164.48s] it&#39;s a win-win for Cooper Standard, a
[6166.719s] loss for the other less innovative
[6168.679s] suppliers, and we like them. They&#39;re
[6170.96s] hitting on all cylinders. Uh, Cooper
[6173.28s] Center continues to target a net
[6174.96s] leverage ratio of less than two times by
[6177.04s] the end of 2027, which would be less
[6179.44s] than half of the current 4.6. This
[6181.199s] target assumes normalized volume levels
[6182.96s] and most importantly does not factor in
[6186.0s] a global refi, which now is looking more
[6188.88s] and more likely uh sooner rather than
[6192.639s] later as the 10-year yield comes down.
[6195.199s] And I think that the minute you see the
[6196.96s] 10-year yield at 380 or 375, they&#39;re
[6200.8s] going to refinance the whole thing and
[6204.639s] probably take out 20 30 million of
[6206.48s] interest costs, which is
[6208.6s] basically, you know, a buck buck and a
[6210.719s] half uh of of earnings per share just on
[6214.08s] that. Uh Cooper Center was awarded 55
[6217.36s] new million in new net business during
[6219.84s] the quarter. Capex as a percentage of
[6222.0s] sales during the quarter was 2.6, six
[6224.0s] well below average of four to 5% as
[6227.119s] management focuses on maximizing return
[6229.28s] on invested capital and maintaining
[6230.719s] capital
[6232.44s] discipline. Then you saw from Michael
[6235.199s] Ward at city auto manufacturers parts
[6239.44s] and equipment the demand picture is
[6241.04s] bright when the tariff fog clears well
[6242.639s] the fog is clearing so the the demand
[6244.96s] picture is bright. What they&#39;re talking
[6246.96s] about is all the things that we&#39;ve been
[6248.48s] talking about since May of 2022 when we
[6250.8s] initiated the
[6252.36s] position.
[6253.96s] Um, in the short term they&#39;re talking
[6256.32s] about the inventory levels which we
[6257.76s] covered. Then they&#39;re talking about
[6259.04s] demographics which was a core to our
[6260.84s] thesis. US vehicle fleet approaching 13
[6263.679s] years replacement accelerates with age.
[6265.92s] By our estimates there are 140 million.
[6268.0s] 45 to 50% of the total population of
[6270.48s] vehicles registered in the US are more
[6272.56s] than 12 years old. The scrap rate for a
[6275.6s] vehicle over 12 years of age is 9 to 10%
[6278.8s] annually compared with a rate of under
[6281.04s] 1% for vehicles under 12 years.
[6283.92s] Scrappage of an older vehicle eventually
[6285.6s] leads to new vehicle sale. The new
[6287.6s] market is the only source of a
[6290.76s] used vehicle. The replacement cost of
[6293.92s] the oldest fleet on record by our
[6295.28s] estimates will result in a replacement
[6297.119s] demand of 12 to 14 million units
[6300.32s] annually over the next 3 to 5 years.
[6308.56s] Since the since 2000, the replacement
[6310.88s] rate of vehicle population has averaged
[6312.6s] 4.8% annually. The oldest fleet on
[6315.199s] record should keep the scrap rate
[6316.8s] elevated. At the low end, a 4% rate
[6318.88s] results in 12 million units of
[6320.8s] replacement demand, and the average rate
[6322.4s] of 4.8% leads to replacement levels of
[6325.44s] 14 million units annually.
[6328.159s] Millennials fuel growth in licensed
[6329.92s] drivers. Uh born between 81 and 96 is
[6333.52s] currently the largest US population
[6335.119s] demographic and the group has entered
[6336.719s] the prime age for home and vehicle
[6338.6s] ownership. Uh which are two of our key
[6341.119s] themes. Ladies and gentlemen, the
[6342.48s] percentage of people with a license to
[6344.08s] drive grows from about 85% of people in
[6346.32s] their 20s to 90% of the people in their
[6348.56s] 40s. 91% of the 35 to 44 age group have
[6352.0s] a driver license to drive in line with
[6353.92s] historical levels. percentage is likely
[6355.76s] to move higher over the next 5 to 10
[6357.52s] years as the rest of the millennial
[6359.6s] generation moves into their
[6361.88s] 40s. Growth in
[6364.6s] drivers is expected uh growth in the
[6367.119s] number of drivers in the 2023 to 2027
[6370.08s] period is expected to be the highest
[6371.6s] level in over 40 years. You can see here
[6374.8s] from trough back to
[6377.4s] peak which will be meaningfully higher
[6380.48s] than the
[6381.8s] 2017 17 peak which is mindboggling.
[6385.28s] Trend demand 16 to 18 million units
[6388.159s] annually. Ladies and gentlemen,
[6390.48s] everything magical about what we&#39;ve been
[6392.639s] our models have been built on is around
[6394.8s] 16.5 to 17. And if they go as high as
[6398.32s] 18, then we have underestimated what
[6400.96s] this stock can do over time.
[6406.44s] Um inventory levels low benefit from
[6409.92s] positive demographic
[6412.6s] trend. Production
[6415.719s] tailwind 2.6
[6418.15s] [Music]
[6419.32s] million. Stronger than expected sales in
[6421.6s] the first half will leave inventory
[6422.88s] levels depleted leading to positive
[6424.4s] production comps for the second half
[6426.0s] into 2026. And the first one here is
[6429.119s] Cooper Standard.
[6431.92s] uh should be in good position for
[6433.76s] accelerating industry
[6436.199s] volume most disciplines cap more
[6438.4s] discipline capital spending 20%
[6440.8s] reduction in debt transferring val that
[6443.199s] value to the equity hello uh margin
[6449.719s] improvement completed headcount
[6451.679s] reductions 150 to 200 basis points to
[6454.08s] margin
[6456.08s] etc okay then you have the earnings call
[6458.56s] which we covered quite a bit of that uh
[6461.6s] uh
[6463.88s] incentives, liquidity, and then
[6466.88s] everything about the tariffs. So, you
[6468.4s] can read through this. I mean, this was
[6471.28s] really an amazing call. Uh but we&#39;ll be
[6474.32s] here all night. Then Stanley Black &amp;
[6476.0s] Decker, which is a play on the themes.
[6478.48s] This got absolute monkey hammered in
[6481.04s] April following the tariff
[6482.84s] announcements. This, ladies and
[6485.119s] gentlemen, it comes down to share. And
[6487.44s] if you zoom out on this
[6490.199s] one, it&#39;s
[6492.44s] exactly like what you
[6496.28s] saw in the early
[6500.119s] 2000s. You had
[6502.119s] this huge rally, correction, looked like
[6506.96s] it was recovering, a complete wipeout,
[6509.76s] which is where we are right now.
[6511.92s] complete wipeout and then a recovery
[6514.159s] almost all the way back up to new highs
[6515.679s] which would imply uh in this case a 10
[6519.04s] it would imply a $180 stock. Okay. And I
[6523.36s] think that&#39;s conservative long-term but
[6525.6s] it&#39;s where we are now. So um we&#39;ve been
[6529.28s] buying more. That&#39;s all I can tell you.
[6531.04s] This is uh you know mana from heaven.
[6533.44s] You can see they&#39;ve taken almost $2
[6534.88s] billion of costs out and we love this
[6538.4s] story uh perspectively and we&#39;ve got a
[6541.119s] very very low basis on this. Now look at
[6543.52s] what&#39;s happened here. Price cash flow
[6546.239s] has fully recovered. Price is actually
[6548.4s] lower than when cash flow was at its
[6550.239s] most negative. We love stories that
[6553.44s] playing these divergences are where
[6555.52s] fortunes are made. And uh when we get a
[6558.239s] fast ball down the middle like this,
[6559.92s] it&#39;s just we cannot resist. The the only
[6563.36s] issue with problems like this is just
[6565.76s] not exceeding our position weight sizing
[6568.4s] and um having unlimited capital and and
[6571.6s] that&#39;s what we want to
[6574.04s] uh take advantage of for our clients
[6576.88s] because this is our next Cooper
[6578.159s] Standard. I mean I look well let me not
[6580.159s] say that Cooper standard is a unique
[6581.679s] situation. It&#39;s, you know, Cooper is
[6584.159s] already up 5x from our initial basis.
[6586.56s] It&#39;s going to probably do at some point
[6589.84s] I think cons, you know, I I think it
[6592.8s] could do another 4x from here over time.
[6595.44s] That&#39;s, you know, if everything goes
[6596.719s] according to plan and, you know, you
[6598.8s] you&#39;ll you&#39;ll manage around it as it
[6600.48s] goes up obviously and you&#39;ll have a
[6602.56s] piece of it that if it goes to 200,
[6604.56s] you&#39;ll still be able to participate, but
[6606.08s] you&#39;re not going to, you know, risk
[6607.6s] every marble, uh, you know, going from
[6609.92s] 100 to 200. you got to, you know, pigs
[6612.32s] get slaughtered. Uh, so, so you manage
[6614.96s] and you take some profits on the way up,
[6616.6s] but I really think that can be special.
[6619.119s] So, Stanley, different story, more like
[6621.36s] a BABA, three bagger, four bagger type
[6623.52s] of thing from here, uh, is is amazing.
[6628.159s] Okay. Okay. And if you want more than a
[6630.8s] double triple, you you buy something
[6632.639s] like QXO uh where you&#39;re betting on the
[6635.36s] guy in uh the case of Brad Jacobs and
[6638.719s] you know that you tuck away for 5 to
[6640.32s] seven years and you wind up with a 78
[6641.84s] bagger uh as well because he&#39;s doing
[6644.56s] what he does amazingly well. He&#39;s using
[6647.36s] uh public multiple arbitrage to buy
[6649.92s] small businesses and frag fragmented
[6652.96s] businesses now that he has his platform.
[6655.199s] And then he uses the public currency at
[6657.04s] the high multiple to buy the private
[6658.56s] fragmented bit business uh with a with a
[6661.84s] uh subpar multiple rinse repeat add
[6664.639s] technology take costs out increased EBID
[6667.04s] off free cash flow rinse and repeat and
[6669.52s] then he&#39;ll get 10 15% of the total
[6671.6s] industry uh with double digit IBIDA
[6674.56s] margin and have you know an $800 billion
[6677.28s] company. Um,
[6679.88s] so you
[6681.639s] know, or you can think about it or chase
[6684.08s] the latest shiny object hoping you can
[6685.76s] get the extra dollar and find a sucker
[6687.36s] to buy after you, hoping the whole thing
[6689.84s] trading at 100 times sales and making no
[6692.08s] money doesn&#39;t collapse and you&#39;re left
[6694.08s] holding the bag. Uh, so we we avoid
[6696.48s] those situations in the latter and we uh
[6699.76s] gravitate towards the situations in the
[6702.599s] former. Uh the key thing here is they&#39;ve
[6706.48s] uh taken
[6708.119s] out they&#39;re close to finishing the $2
[6710.639s] billion of costs which I think we
[6713.88s] had done the math on
[6717.32s] previously. All I can tell you
[6720.199s] is the smallest amount of improvement in
[6725.52s] construction is going to be a hockey
[6727.76s] stick to earnings. And when you look at
[6729.36s] the demand that we just covered for
[6730.8s] cars, which also applies for housing
[6733.04s] formation and new housing, what you&#39;re
[6735.52s] going to see with Stanley is going to be
[6737.36s] phenomenal. Uh DeWalt is back to revenue
[6740.239s] growth. Some key points here. Margins
[6742.32s] came in at
[6744.28s] 30.4. Their target is 35. The last time
[6748.159s] they did 35% margin and earned 160 I
[6752.639s] think it I forget what their operating
[6754.88s] income was but it translated
[6757.88s] to 160 to $185. In other words, when
[6761.92s] they hit 35% margins, the earnings
[6766.56s] power, the last time they had that level
[6768.8s] of earnings power,
[6771.239s] um the stock was trading between $160
[6773.92s] and $180 a share. Okay, that and that&#39;s
[6777.04s] assuming very limited growth. That&#39;s
[6779.04s] just assuming the margin expansion,
[6781.44s] steady state, etc. Um, the beauty
[6785.88s] of housing like auto suppliers is when
[6789.679s] they turn the amount of operating
[6791.52s] leverage is insane and you get these
[6794.639s] hockey sticks like, you know, it&#39;s like,
[6796.8s] oh, should I buy it
[6798.679s] at, you know, oh, I bought it at $75,
[6802.0s] it&#39;s $60. Like, it&#39;s it&#39;s a rounding. It
[6805.119s] makes no difference. It&#39;s It&#39;s a
[6806.8s] complete rounding error because when
[6808.08s] these things go, this is going to be
[6810.159s] 150, $180, $200 stock. And whether you
[6812.96s] bought it at $71 or
[6815.4s] $63, uh, or $81 makes literally zero
[6820.0s] difference. That what what would what
[6821.84s] would be problematic is if you bought it
[6823.92s] at 80 and you sold it at 60 and you wind
[6826.88s] up buying it at 150 because you&#39;re an
[6829.599s] idiot, okay? And you missed it. Okay?
[6831.92s] The key is if you bought it at 80 and it
[6833.92s] went to 60 and you didn&#39;t buy more and
[6835.76s] bring your basis down to 70, then you
[6837.84s] missed an opportunity. There&#39;s nothing I
[6839.36s] could do for you because you don&#39;t
[6840.48s] understand what you own. But if you
[6841.92s] actually do the work, and you know, I&#39;m
[6843.92s] not even asking you to do the hours upon
[6845.52s] hours of work uh that we&#39;re doing here
[6848.4s] and Jeff did a great job of of compiling
[6851.04s] all this uh for our weekly article. If
[6855.119s] all you do is you take the 30 minutes to
[6857.679s] actually read it and understand it, even
[6859.28s] if you don&#39;t listen to the hours of
[6860.48s] conference call, of competitors
[6861.84s] conference calls, of channel checks, of
[6864.639s] industry checks, even if you don&#39;t do
[6866.639s] any of that, even if you just read, you
[6868.239s] would know what you own. And and I think
[6870.8s] um some people make the mistake of an
[6873.599s] unwillingness to burden themselves with
[6875.36s] the facts because once you burden
[6876.719s] yourself with the facts, you&#39;re like,
[6877.92s] &quot;Holy things like this come
[6879.92s] around.&quot; Like I mean you know in the
[6884.08s] case of Stanley Black &amp; Decker you get
[6885.92s] an opportunity like this once every 10
[6887.52s] to 15 years. Okay. Last time you had the
[6889.76s] opportunity was the great financial
[6890.96s] crisis. So 16 years ago before that it
[6894.0s] was nine years before that you had an
[6895.84s] opportunity to to to buy it at these
[6897.84s] levels of complete dislocation. But the
[6899.36s] fact of the matter DeWalt Stanley
[6901.28s] Craftsman these these have been around
[6902.96s] for decades generations upon generations
[6905.44s] have used them. Why? Because they&#39;re the
[6907.199s] best. They are the best brand. they&#39;ve
[6909.04s] got brand equity and when the underlying
[6913.159s] conditions which are perfectly set all
[6915.679s] we need is the
[6917.639s] 10 we&#39;re going to cover a lot of this at
[6919.84s] the money show by the way uh with the
[6921.84s] amount of federal land that they&#39;re
[6922.88s] going to open up uh with what&#39;s going to
[6925.04s] happen with rates with all the
[6926.56s] conditions that are going to be in place
[6927.76s] and the and the explicit
[6930.199s] demand these are better way to play it
[6932.639s] than the homebuilders which are going to
[6934.08s] be fighting margin wars against each
[6935.52s] other and having to produce more and
[6936.8s] more and more to keep their earn
[6938.32s] earnings going uh where the arms dealers
[6941.36s] were going to make the most money in the
[6942.56s] shortest spot of time with the Stanley&#39;s
[6945.199s] and with the Generracks and with the
[6949.0s] QXOs. So, you should go through this. We
[6952.08s] even highlighted the important parts in
[6953.92s] green so you can see what happens with
[6955.44s] tariffs and how a lot of the stuff&#39;s
[6957.119s] covered under US MCA. Very similar story
[6959.36s] to Cooper Standard. The only difference
[6960.639s] is Cooper started to move. It&#39;s up 5x.
[6963.28s] Stanley&#39;s going to start to move. It&#39;ll
[6964.719s] be a double probably a year from now.
[6966.719s] And then people will look back and say,
[6968.159s] &quot;I missed it.&quot; And they&#39;ll buy it up,
[6969.76s] you know, one and a half times. It&#39;ll
[6971.119s] correct 40%, they&#39;ll sell at the whole.
[6973.36s] And then at 180, 200, they&#39;ll be chasing
[6975.84s] up and that&#39;ll and it&#39;ll be over. Uh,
[6978.0s] and that&#39;s just the way it goes.
[6980.44s] Um, GenerRack, exact same story. Look
[6983.119s] what&#39;s happened to free cash flow. Look
[6984.96s] what&#39;s happened to price. Our prize is
[6987.679s] back to the levels it was when cash flow
[6989.36s] was completely negative. This thing is
[6991.599s] just getting started. This is a normal
[6993.679s] cyclical recovery for Generrack and the
[6996.639s] game is just starting. So,
[6999.96s] uh, yeah, we&#39;re way in here. So, I got a
[7004.0s] key points we&#39;ve covered in the past.
[7007.36s] CNI business starting to recover. That&#39;s
[7009.199s] good to
[7011.08s] see. Uh, so at the very least, go
[7014.88s] through the 10 key points. If you&#39;re not
[7017.44s] even willing to read that, go through
[7019.119s] that and you can see why we&#39;re so
[7020.639s] excited about these opportunities. And
[7022.639s] we spent the last four weeks just
[7024.4s] loading the boat every which way we
[7026.4s] could. Disney shot the lights out. We&#39;re
[7028.48s] going to cover that in more detail next
[7030.56s] week. Uh some sentiment is coming back
[7033.199s] into the market, but not extreme yet.
[7036.159s] So, there&#39;s more to do. Uh earnings
[7038.639s] NASDAQ top 30 weights in the last 60
[7041.76s] days estimates went up by 1.1%.
[7045.76s] uh and for next year went up two basis
[7048.48s] points. Dow went down a little bit by
[7051.639s] 2.48% for this year, 2.65 for next year.
[7056.4s] Economic data
[7063.719s] um non-manufacturing PMI was in
[7067.52s] expansion came in better than expected.
[7078.239s] See if there&#39;s anything else here we
[7079.92s] need to know about. Continuing claims
[7083.119s] came in lower than expected. Initial
[7085.04s] jobless claims came in lower than
[7091.48s] expected. And there you go. And then
[7093.8s] earnings were expected to grow at 6%
[7096.32s] this quarter. They actually grew at
[7098.48s] 12.8% 8% with over 80% of the companies
[7102.48s] now recording. And look what happened to
[7105.04s] estimates, ladies and gentlemen. They
[7107.36s] stopped going down. They were down 3.6%
[7110.48s] at 265. They&#39;re now at 266 for this year
[7115.04s] and uh still 302 for next year. Okay, so
[7120.719s] the podcast is done. We&#39;re for those of
[7122.719s] you who love the ask me anything
[7124.4s] questions from the audience. We&#39;re going
[7126.639s] to cover at least five of them now.
[7129.199s] We&#39;ll cover as many as we can, but this
[7131.28s] one&#39;s running long. So, let&#39;s see here.
[7135.84s] Okay. Paul asks about advanced auto
[7138.52s] parts. He says, uh, third point took an
[7141.52s] active
[7142.76s] position and then they exited their
[7145.639s] position. Yeah. So, I would say two
[7148.0s] things about that. Number one, we never
[7150.0s] got in becau be because Third Point was
[7152.08s] involved and we would never get out
[7153.679s] because Third Point is involved. We get
[7155.36s] in and out because we do our own work.
[7158.08s] Uh we love what Shane Kelly has done.
[7160.08s] He&#39;s done everything that he said he was
[7161.52s] going to do. Delever by selling off
[7163.36s] Canada, shut off shut down the
[7165.199s] nonprofitable stores, cut all the
[7167.28s] losses, cut the costs, start the hub and
[7169.84s] spoke model in the areas that they are
[7171.679s] the leaders. And now that they&#39;ve done
[7173.92s] all the cleanup work, guess what they&#39;re
[7175.36s] doing? They&#39;re going to open up a
[7176.719s] hundred new stores over the next couple
[7178.32s] of years. That is not what you hear from
[7179.92s] a company that&#39;s going out of business
[7181.36s] that they&#39;re opening up a hundred new
[7182.56s] stores. So, um, so we&#39;re excited about
[7185.04s] that one. Thanks for sending that in,
[7186.639s] Robert, but it&#39;s irrelevant. I don&#39;t
[7189.04s] invest on the basis of what other people
[7190.8s] do. If they happen to invest after I
[7192.88s] invest, great. Happy to have them on
[7194.56s] board. It brings more attention to the
[7196.08s] name, but um, I could care less. I I
[7198.96s] underwrite each individual business as
[7200.88s] if I was buying the local bodega and I
[7203.119s] wanted to see their financial statements
[7204.719s] before I made an offer. York
[7222.84s] bourgeoa I suppose
[7233.599s] Yeah, you&#39;re just study the conference
[7236.88s] call. All the answers to your questions
[7238.56s] are there. You don&#39;t have to ask me. All
[7240.08s] you have to do is just read what what
[7242.32s] management tells you and verify and
[7245.04s] you&#39;re you&#39;re golden. But
[7246.239s] congratulations on buying more shares at
[7248.08s] 13. You&#39;re already up on a double. Uh
[7250.4s] Chris Williamson. Okay, look at Beckton
[7253.199s] Dickinson.
[7260.119s] Uh, okay. Yeah, I think there&#39;s going to
[7263.4s] be great opportunities with the medical
[7266.32s] device
[7268.52s] companies. Uh, but we&#39;re playing it
[7270.719s] through
[7274.76s] Baxter. I think BDX is okay
[7279.08s] though.
[7283.239s] BDX. What? Oh, I&#39;m not signed in. I&#39;m
[7285.76s] like, where is
[7291.08s] my All right, so
[7293.239s] BDX, let&#39;s take a look at this.
[7321.119s] Yeah, it&#39;s interesting. It
[7323.719s] it this one&#39;s complicated and and I I&#39;ve
[7327.04s] continued to look at this and I&#39;ve
[7328.639s] continued to do nothing. And honestly,
[7330.88s] some of it is just instinct and gut
[7333.199s] after a while. Um especially it it&#39;s
[7336.8s] never I never make an investment on
[7339.199s] instinct and gut but I will avoid an
[7341.28s] investment on instinct and gut because
[7342.8s] there&#39;s no penalty for avoiding an
[7344.48s] investment. There&#39;s there&#39;s
[7346.159s] predominantly a penalty for you know
[7349.36s] errors of omission versus commission. If
[7351.28s] you commit uh capital and you&#39;re wrong,
[7354.96s] you got a problem. If you pass on
[7357.04s] something and it works without you, it&#39;s
[7358.639s] it&#39;s fine because it&#39;s like which one of
[7360.159s] your other babies were you going to sell
[7361.599s] and etc. etc. that you&#39;ve done all the
[7363.84s] work on.
[7371.96s] Um, I mean, this has always kind of been
[7374.8s] a low quality business in terms of
[7377.84s] inability to compound capital that you
[7379.92s] give to it above what you could get for
[7382.32s] free. So, that&#39;s why I&#39;m not a huge fan
[7384.08s] of it. Um, balance sheet, it&#39;s probably
[7388.32s] okay. Let&#39;s see.
[7396.56s] 20
[7397.48s] billion. Yeah, it seems a little bit
[7404.679s] leveraged. 18 billion, $2 billion of
[7407.36s] cash. That&#39;s
[7409.32s] probably a little bit of an issue. Um, I
[7412.56s] mean, I don&#39;t think they&#39;re not going to
[7413.679s] be bankrupt or anything like that,
[7415.96s] but it&#39;s a lot of leverage for that type
[7419.04s] of business.
[7420.8s] generating three billion of free cash
[7423.719s] flow.
[7428.04s] Um, this is a tough one. I mean, this
[7430.4s] stock has gone nowhere in almost a
[7431.84s] decade. So, you definitely need a
[7433.36s] catalyst of new
[7436.119s] management. I think it&#39;s early. I think
[7438.48s] you&#39;re generally right. I just think
[7440.159s] it&#39;s I think it&#39;s early. I think it&#39;s
[7442.4s] going to take a while because it broke a
[7445.199s] lot of institutional money that thought
[7446.8s] this was safe and it&#39;s going to take a
[7450.08s] while to build a new level of
[7451.84s] sponsorship probably around the 150s and
[7454.4s] 140s and it may take two three years for
[7456.239s] them to kind of turn this. So for me
[7458.4s] it&#39;s a pass. I mean you could get a
[7459.76s] quick
[7460.599s] recovery but I I it&#39;s just not obvious
[7463.36s] to me. So I&#39;m going to pass. Uh ever
[7465.679s] looked at B&amp;G Foods? Uh yeah, we&#39;ve had
[7469.119s] it on a couple times and we passed and I
[7471.44s] think it went a lot lower. Let me just
[7472.96s] see.
[7478.119s] B
[7480.76s] G P
[7482.92s] and G G
[7509.44s] I can&#39;t even find the
[7514.92s] ticker. Try
[7520.719s] uh BGS.
[7526.199s] Okay. If you&#39;re buying it for the
[7528.239s] dividend, don&#39;t waste your time.
[7531.84s] Um,
[7565.76s] So sales have done nothing in five
[7571.0s] years. Are they buying in
[7577.32s] shares? No, they&#39;re issuing shares. So
[7580.8s] their sales are not growing and they&#39;re
[7582.32s] issuing equity at record low valuations.
[7585.599s] That is a no no for me. That is like
[7591.04s] Wall of shame. Executive action. Free
[7594.639s] cash flow is 100 million. What&#39;s their
[7596.239s] balance sheet look
[7598.28s] like? 50 million. And what&#39;s the
[7602.92s] debt? 2 billion. Ah, this thing&#39;s it&#39;s
[7606.4s] priced for bankruptcy. I don&#39;t know that
[7608.8s] it will go bankrupt. It might recover.
[7610.719s] Then you&#39;re going to get huge equity
[7612.0s] leverage. But uh I want to hear the
[7614.239s] turnaround plan. For me, it&#39;s down for a
[7617.119s] reason. It could definitely be a trade.
[7620.32s] I don&#39;t I don&#39;t like the story.
[7627.159s] Uh David Gavin asked me about like, you
[7630.159s] know, favorite investments of all time.
[7632.32s] I mean, a lot of them have been um it&#39;s
[7635.44s] not just the equity being up multibags,
[7637.599s] it&#39;s whether it&#39;s, you know, Range
[7639.199s] Resources, Rolls-Royce, a bunch of the
[7641.84s] others. I would say in many cases it
[7645.88s] was the option expression that got 10
[7649.199s] bagger plus on top of the multibagger
[7651.599s] equity where we made huge amounts of
[7654.48s] money. Um so it&#39;s it&#39;s structuring those
[7657.36s] and taking advantage of how we do that
[7659.44s] for our clients. Uh LL from a good
[7663.119s] friend first initial J. You know who you
[7667.199s] are. Let&#39;s see here.
[7670.56s] This is a casino
[7673.32s] play. Stocks down
[7677.239s] 2/3 lll. These are tough. Usually what I
[7680.96s] do with casinos. It&#39;s like win or Las
[7683.92s] Vegas Sands when they&#39;re down. So this
[7686.159s] is negative free cash flow. Their
[7687.84s] revenues are
[7688.92s] growing. Uh they&#39;re building a new
[7691.04s] casino. It hasn&#39;t turned positive free
[7693.36s] cash flow yet. It seems like it&#39;s
[7694.8s] trending in the right direction. Let&#39;s
[7696.079s] see what the balance sheet looks like.
[7703.679s] I think they just built a new casino in
[7705.599s] Colorado if I remember. So they got 40
[7707.84s] million of
[7711.0s] cash and they got half a billion dollars
[7713.679s] of
[7715.48s] debt. That&#39;s cutting it close, boys.
[7718.89s] [Music]
[7720.679s] Um it&#39;s never really compounded capital
[7723.44s] for owners. Let&#39;s see what their free
[7725.76s] cash flow looks like on that $2 billion
[7727.679s] of
[7729.96s] debt. Negative free cash flow last three
[7733.48s] years. So, you know, I think they did a
[7736.48s] Hail Mary pass here on the new casino.
[7738.56s] And if it works, it could work.
[7742.36s] Um, what are they doing to
[7744.37s] [Music]
[7748.599s] shares? Increasing the amount of shares.
[7752.639s] This is not this is not the kind of
[7754.56s] thing I like to touch. And the other
[7756.079s] thing is this has a history of being a
[7760.239s] disaster. Like they&#39;ve never created
[7761.76s] wealth for their owners in three
[7763.199s] decades. So it sounds to me like they&#39;re
[7765.36s] operating subpar assets. Maybe this new
[7767.36s] one will be their saving grace and it&#39;s
[7769.599s] the Hail Mary that works.
[7773.88s] But if the asset structure and the
[7777.28s] management company haven&#39;t been able to
[7779.52s] generate any wealth for their owners in
[7781.84s] three decades, I it&#39;s probably safe to
[7784.0s] say that they will continue to destroy
[7785.679s] wealth uh in the form of opportunity co
[7788.88s] cost for the next few decades. So for
[7791.199s] this one, I&#39;m a pass. I do hope it
[7793.28s] works, but I&#39;m not going to be involved.
[7795.92s] Uh
[7797.0s] Johannis, hi Tom, big fan of the
[7799.119s] podcast. been listening. I was wondering
[7801.84s] what you think about Whirlpool uh play
[7803.44s] on the housing market comeback. I like
[7805.36s] it. Uh we&#39;ve covered it before. We
[7807.679s] haven&#39;t done anything and um I think
[7810.32s] now&#39;s the time. Uh let me just double
[7813.36s] check. I think there were some yellow
[7815.28s] flags when we last looked at
[7817.48s] it, but I think you&#39;re on the right
[7819.84s] track. So cash flow is just starting to
[7821.599s] inflct. Revenues have collapsed. I think
[7824.639s] that was a worry for us. We wanted to
[7826.239s] understand the turnaround plan and we
[7828.96s] haven&#39;t gotten any comfort. Let&#39;s just
[7830.56s] see if they&#39;ve got enough runway to
[7833.84s] figure out their turnaround
[7837.96s] plan. I mean, this is a big drop in
[7840.32s] earnings. 20 uh in revenues. 25% drop in
[7843.119s] revenues. What are they doing to the
[7844.48s] share
[7847.0s] count? They&#39;re taking it down a little
[7849.119s] bit. That&#39;s good.
[7852.8s] cash
[7858.28s] flow. They paid back some
[7862.44s] debt, repurchased some
[7866.679s] stock, free cash flow positive, although
[7870.0s] moving in the wrong
[7874.679s] direction, 1.2 billion of cash, 4
[7878.159s] billion of debt.
[7881.119s] I kind of like this
[7886.119s] one. You know, it it definitely warrants
[7889.679s] doing the work on it. Uh you put a gun
[7891.92s] to my head, I would buy it. So, um but
[7895.04s] there&#39;s not a gun to my head, so I don&#39;t
[7896.32s] have to buy it. Philip Andro
[7899.88s] Pinkos, Interfor
[7902.76s] Corporation, Lumber Producer. I don&#39;t I
[7905.36s] generally don&#39;t do
[7906.92s] commodity plays in equities because I
[7910.4s] got to win on two bets, the price of the
[7912.239s] commodity and management&#39;s operations
[7915.679s] operational discipline and excellence.
[7918.239s] Um, with the exception of energy
[7920.4s] companies from time to time, but let&#39;s
[7922.079s] take a look at it for for fun
[7926.92s] here. IFP
[7937.599s] All right. So, you&#39;ve you know the price
[7939.92s] has come down along with the cash flow
[7941.76s] and the revenues and the
[7949.56s] margins. Okay. So, your bet is that
[7951.76s] lumber prices
[7953.639s] are recovering.
[7960.079s] I mean, I guess it&#39;s a backdoor play on
[7962.079s] housing as
[7965.159s] well. Let&#39;s see if you got enough
[7968.36s] runway to see it
[7971.88s] through. Got 30 million of
[7975.079s] cash down from 400.
[7982.96s] $600 million of debt.
[7992.48s] You got a problem, Cowboy. I just don&#39;t
[7994.56s] I think you&#39;re right that it&#39;s going to
[7996.079s] rebound. The question is whether you&#39;re
[7997.76s] going to be around to benefit from it.
[8000.159s] Um
[8022.32s] I think you got to do a lot of work on
[8023.84s] this. I think it&#39;s interesting, but I
[8025.44s] think you&#39;re on a knife&#39;s edge there.
[8026.96s] But um so you got to understand when
[8029.04s] does the debt mature, what is the
[8031.199s] interest rate? Is it expected to go up
[8033.04s] or down? And then do a sensitivity
[8035.36s] analysis based on every commodity price
[8037.52s] for lumber. It&#39;s a lot of work. For me,
[8040.079s] that goes in the two hard pile. I think
[8041.84s] you&#39;re going to be right though. Eric C
[8044.0s] is wondering if you have any thoughts on
[8045.36s] UPS. We covered that one a few weeks
[8047.04s] ago. We like it, but we like it at lower
[8049.44s] levels was the short answer. Let&#39;s see.
[8052.32s] Oh, it got to lower levels. So,
[8055.0s] uh I think it&#39;s interesting, but it&#39;s
[8057.52s] it&#39;s a broken stock, so it&#39;s going to
[8059.119s] take a couple years to build a base. I
[8061.599s] think you&#39;re going to have time to get
[8062.639s] into it. It&#39;ll probably rebound quickly
[8064.639s] now and then go back
[8067.0s] down and languish there for a while.
[8087.28s] I don&#39;t I I I think you&#39;re right. I
[8089.76s] mean, if I can get it at 70 or 80, then
[8092.48s] I can then I&#39;m willing to wait three
[8094.159s] years with it being dead money because
[8096.32s] when it recovers, it&#39;s going to be, you
[8098.48s] know, double or triple. But I just think
[8100.32s] it&#39;s early. It&#39;s broken. They destroyed
[8102.32s] a ton of institutional holders and it&#39;s
[8104.0s] going to take an awful long time to
[8105.44s] rebuild trust and rebuild a shareholder
[8107.48s] base. So, for that reason, I&#39;m going to
[8109.84s] pass even though I think you&#39;re right.
[8111.84s] Let me just quickly look at some of the
[8113.36s] financials here.
[8133.599s] 20 billion of
[8134.92s] debt on
[8138.599s] six. Let&#39;s see what they&#39;ve done to the
[8140.719s] share
[8150.04s] account. Yeah, I I like it. I like the
[8153.199s] idea. I like the story. I like it all. I
[8155.76s] think it&#39;s gonna take longer than you
[8157.28s] think to recover, but I think it&#39;s
[8159.04s] definitely going to recover.
[8161.639s] So, it&#39;s a good idea and I&#39;m not going
[8164.32s] to participate, but I&#39;m going to keep a
[8167.28s] strong eye. Like, it could easily go
[8170.0s] from 95 back to 150 and I&#39;ll just be
[8173.28s] happy. I&#39;m just not involved. It&#39;s okay.
[8175.44s] But if it if it did if it did move down
[8177.92s] to 70, which I highly
[8180.36s] doubt, I&#39;d be willing
[8183.0s] to buy it knowing it&#39;s going to be dead
[8185.44s] money for two years because my IRRa 3 to
[8188.48s] 5 years out would be high enough. It&#39;s
[8190.0s] not high enough from here for me to
[8191.84s] accept the possibility of dead money for
[8193.599s] two to three years while they rebuild a
[8195.599s] shareholder base.
[8197.8s] Um, would appreciate your opinion on
[8200.319s] buying Baba on the Frankfurt Stock
[8202.0s] Exchange.
[8204.16s] uh then you have FX risk etc. Look
[8209.88s] uh then you&#39;re making like three bets
[8212.639s] instead of one.
[8214.28s] So you&#39;re never going to have certainty
[8216.399s] on anything. We own the shares on Hong
[8218.88s] Kong. We own the derivatives on the US.
[8220.88s] We understand the risks. We
[8223.16s] fully could see
[8226.0s] uh the derivatives go to zero. I think
[8228.16s] the probability of that is sub 10% I
[8231.439s] think to be honest with you. But it&#39;s
[8234.16s] not
[8235.0s] nothing. I personally wouldn&#39;t take
[8237.28s] currency
[8239.88s] and company and country risk. Uh for me,
[8244.8s] I would just own it in Hong Kong,
[8246.719s] transfer your shares. But if you want to
[8248.16s] own it in Germany and take the currency
[8249.76s] risk, have at it. Uh, Matt
[8256.28s] Mitchell. GT
[8274.679s] G&amp;TX. The short answer is I won&#39;t be
[8277.2s] involved because I don&#39;t think I have at
[8278.96s] least a double upside. Uh, but I think
[8281.92s] you&#39;re
[8282.76s] probably
[8286.76s] right to buy some here. Um, a little
[8290.559s] worried about their margins continue to
[8292.08s] decline. What do they do here?
[8307.08s] description. Digital vision connected
[8309.599s] car dimmable glass and fire
[8315.639s] protection. Automatic dimming rear view
[8318.599s] mirrors. Automotive electronics and
[8321.24s] non-automatic dimming rear view. Yeah,
[8323.92s] this is
[8327.719s] not anything like Cooper Standard. Yeah,
[8330.399s] they happen to be an auto parts
[8331.76s] supplier, but that this is not like
[8334.08s] indispensable
[8335.8s] stuff. Um, let me just take a look at
[8339.04s] the
[8343.08s] financials. If you&#39;re going to be in a
[8344.88s] commodity business, you really want to
[8346.08s] be in a commodity business and be the
[8350.12s] leader. This
[8357.84s] Cash flow has been pretty
[8378.679s] steady. Balance she&#39;s pretty healthy.
[8380.88s] So, you just have to really understand
[8382.399s] their products. I I think what you&#39;ve
[8384.16s] got
[8385.319s] here
[8392.68s] is I think what you have here is a don&#39;t
[8396.16s] get fired from your job easy 50% over
[8398.72s] the next couple of years. It&#39;s not going
[8401.12s] to be a home run, but it&#39;s a good
[8402.64s] quality business at a good price. And as
[8405.04s] long as you understand the product and
[8406.319s] the competitive landscape, I think you
[8407.76s] found a
[8408.52s] winner. All right.
[8411.359s] That&#39;s that. But not a home run. It&#39;s
[8413.359s] like a single. I go for doubles and
[8415.04s] triples. That that&#39;s a s, you know, and
[8416.72s] every now and then home runs like
[8418.08s] Cooper, but um that&#39;s that&#39;s a single
[8421.439s] and it&#39;s it&#39;s probably a pretty sure
[8423.319s] single.
[8426.12s] Uh Saga, congratulations on Cooper
[8428.8s] Standard. Okay. Why? No.
[8439.24s] PLCE. Yeah, this thing is a chronic bag
[8443.0s] of crap. So, let&#39;s see.
[8453.92s] Mythac Capital purchase 50% financial
[8457.439s] support loans over
[8459.319s] total.
[8461.72s] Yeah, I don&#39;t think this business is a
[8464.399s] good business. Let me just take a look
[8465.84s] at the
[8474.12s] financials. I mean, their revenues are
[8476.319s] collap. So, so this guy that&#39;s involved
[8478.479s] or whoever the hell he is is probably
[8480.72s] doing some type of real estate play like
[8482.399s] all the people that got bagged in
[8483.72s] Macy&#39;s. I don&#39;t think this thing turns.
[8488.359s] Um, there are no signs of it unless they
[8490.88s] got some miracle turnaround plan, but I
[8492.56s] don&#39;t I don&#39;t know
[8498.76s] that this is the type of business that
[8501.2s] has to go through bankruptcy, wipe out
[8502.96s] the debt, and then maybe the brand is
[8505.52s] worth
[8510.2s] something. 166 million. I mean, it&#39;s not
[8512.72s] a huge amount of debt, but relative to
[8515.04s] their $5 million of cash, it
[8517.96s] is. Uh, I understand why you want to do
[8520.88s] this, cuz if they actually fix it, the
[8522.8s] thing goes from five bucks to 50 bucks
[8524.88s] pretty quickly.
[8537.28s] Children&#39;s specialty
[8540.68s] portfolio. Children&#39;s
[8554.439s] clothes. I don&#39;t think so. I&#39;ve seen too
[8557.12s] many of these specialty retailer
[8558.56s] businesses like Chico and all that stuff
[8561.12s] go
[8562.68s] bankrupt.
[8571.16s] Uh yeah, so they&#39;ve got a new sugar
[8574.72s] daddy for a little while, but those guys
[8577.04s] usually get wiped too. I I would pass.
[8580.56s] Ultimately, what&#39;s going to happen is
[8582.12s] those debt financeers are going to own
[8584.479s] the whole business at the end of the day
[8586.16s] and wipe out everyone subordinate to
[8588.08s] them uh including the equity. Eric F
[8593.2s] uh
[8596.96s] uh asking about what should he do with
[8599.04s] Birkshire. We covered that in the uh 10
[8601.359s] minutes with uh CNA.
[8611.2s] Uh he&#39;s talking about investing with
[8612.88s] Great Hill Capital versus just buying
[8614.399s] Berkshire. Uh look, I have 100% of my
[8616.88s] net worth in in Great Hill. Uh I think,
[8620.0s] you know, based on what I said with
[8622.319s] number one, the law of large numbers.
[8623.92s] Number two, with Buffett kind of being
[8625.28s] out of the picture,
[8627.319s] uh I think basically owning Bergkshire
[8629.68s] is going to be like owning the S&amp;P 500.
[8631.68s] So, um you know, talk is cheap. I put my
[8635.52s] money where my mouth is and I&#39;ll leave
[8637.2s] it at that. Uh
[8640.359s] Dylan
[8643.479s] K. Uh I think we&#39;ve we&#39;ve covered that
[8646.479s] multiple times before. Leaf Foster, what
[8648.8s] do you think about
[8653.24s] Pterodine? It&#39;s a great
[8655.319s] company. Let&#39;s just see if it&#39;s the
[8657.359s] right time.
[8669.76s] This is not a fat pitch for me. I like
[8672.96s] your thought process, but I
[8676.68s] just I don&#39;t think I&#39;m getting
[8678.72s] compensated enough for the
[8681.96s] risk. If I&#39;m going to take risk, let me
[8684.399s] take some real risk. let me own Intel
[8686.64s] where my downside is pretty much
[8688.08s] protected and if they fail I come out
[8691.04s] flat and if they succeed I get a quick
[8693.439s] double and if they really succeed and
[8695.439s] execute like I think they can with Lip
[8697.2s] Boutan I wind up with a four to five
[8699.319s] bagger. Um that&#39;s where I want to take
[8701.84s] my risk. I don&#39;t want my risk in this
[8703.72s] like if I win I&#39;m up 50% and if I&#39;m lose
[8707.2s] I&#39;m down 100 like that I&#39;m not willing
[8709.04s] to accept. So, um, cuz I have to size it
[8713.359s] in accordance
[8714.92s] and it just doesn&#39;t this is not a triple
[8718.24s] in the next 3 years. So, and it&#39;s
[8720.24s] probably not even a double. So, for that
[8721.92s] reason,
[8723.68s] um, as much as I love the I think the
[8726.399s] business is a good business, I just
[8727.92s] don&#39;t think there&#39;s enough juice in it
[8729.2s] for me to risk a dollar of capital, even
[8731.04s] though it probably goes up, not down.
[8733.68s] Uh, let&#39;s see here.
[8747.76s] I mean, it definitely has the runway, so
[8750.24s] you just have to get comfortable
[8752.28s] with the turnaround plan.
[8766.08s] This this is not where I want to play. I
[8767.76s] I I think you&#39;re right. I I just It&#39;s a
[8770.0s] pass for me. But good question. And with
[8772.64s] that said, we&#39;re done. We covered all of
[8774.16s] our questions. We&#39;ll be back next week.
[8779.08s] Um maybe a day early from New
[8782.359s] York, maybe a day late from Florida, but
[8785.359s] we&#39;ll get it out to you next week for
[8786.96s] sure. I&#39;m sure we&#39;ll have a lot of great
