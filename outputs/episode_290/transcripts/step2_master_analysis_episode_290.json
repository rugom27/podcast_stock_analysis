  "executive_summary": "Tom Hayes is cautiously optimistic, anticipating a high single-digit upside for the S&P 500, potentially reaching low double digits with positive news. He emphasizes the resilience of the US consumer and the potential for international equities to outperform. He highlights opportunities in specific sectors like auto suppliers (Cooper Standard), housing-related stocks (Stanley Black & Decker, Generac, QXO), and Chinese equities (Alibaba). He believes that bears are praying for a retest of the lows, but forced buying due to trade deal announcements will likely push the market higher. He also notes that the market is in a similar position to the 2018 recovery in Trump 1.0.",
