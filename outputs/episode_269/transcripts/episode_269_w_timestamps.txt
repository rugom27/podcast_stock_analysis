[169.04s] on to business ladies and gentlemen had
[172.08s] the pleasure to join Cheryl Kone on the
[175.239s] claiming countdown Fox Business this
[177.319s] week on Tuesday want to thank Catherine
[179.959s] Myers Jake Max to Oppenheimer Brook hak
[184.48s] who produced this segment and Liz
[186.159s] Clayman for having me on we&#39;re going to
[188.319s] listen in here you know and one of the
[190.36s] things that you talk about in your
[191.4s] research is fiscal and policy wild cards
[193.879s] and Tom I want to take that to you
[195.56s] because looking ahead to
[197.239s] 2025 uh you know you&#39;re saying these are
[199.799s] possible surprises the US dollar could
[201.799s] weaken after the inauguration and that
[204.159s] energy stocks could underperform which I
[206.599s] think is interesting and I want to point
[208.2s] this out to you uh wolf research put out
[210.439s] a note this morning they say that the
[212.239s] Trump trade is already running out of
[214.92s] steam they say uncertainty in the first
[217.159s] half puts a damper on that trade uh so
[219.959s] in the meantime they&#39;re focused on the
[221.799s] mag 7 how do you respond to
[224.239s] that well thanks Sherl I think to tag on
[226.92s] what Dutch was talking about his long
[228.72s] duration trades I think the biggest
[230.959s] surprise of 2025 is going to be that the
[233.76s] 10-year treasury gets bid yields
[236.439s] compressed what we saw in
[238.04s] 2016 after the election
[240.36s] treasuries sold off yields went up after
[242.879s] the inauguration of trump bonds got bid
[245.68s] yields compressed and that&#39;s going to
[247.04s] help Dutch&#39;s long long duration trades
[249.56s] but we like simpler stocks we like
[252.079s] Boeing is a headline today that one&#39;s
[254.599s] still down 60% and you can&#39;t give it
[256.88s] away but guess what Kelly ortberg is
[259.239s] fixing the ship he&#39;s got the union
[261.6s] problem solved he&#39;s got the 737 back on
[264.08s] the line he&#39;s got a half a trillion
[266.28s] dollar backlog over the next 10 years so
[268.919s] I think it&#39;s going to surprise surpris
[270.199s] people that Boeing continues to climb
[273.0s] higher but the work the concern about
[274.8s] Boeing though is that about I think it&#39;s
[276.56s] correct me if I&#39;m wrong about 60% of the
[279.0s] revenue the payment for each plane
[280.8s] doesn&#39;t come into the company until they
[283.36s] actually deliver the aircraft so that
[285.72s] all of this delay has been one of the
[287.28s] issues that that hit the stock during
[289.56s] the strike you&#39;re not concerned about
[291.52s] this
[292.72s] backlog they&#39;ve taken out a tremendous
[295.32s] amount of cost Cheryl the backlog is
[297.84s] solid China is going to double its Fleet
[300.96s] by 2043 oh and by the way you can only
[303.919s] get planes from two vendors one&#39;s called
[305.96s] Boeing one&#39;s called Airbus the stocks
[308.0s] down 60% this is one you can tuck away
[311.199s] you can sleep well at night and by the
[312.759s] way Kelly ortberg is a turnaround
[314.56s] specialist at Rockwell Collins in just
[317.4s] six years he quadrupled the shareholders
[320.919s] money before he sold the company so I
[323.039s] think he&#39;s going to do a tremendous job
[324.639s] turning things around he&#39;s on the floor
[326.759s] in Seattle engineer not a salesperson
[329.72s] we&#39;re going to see good things from
[330.759s] Boeing in the next two years you can see
[332.479s] from the chart Tom that the stock is in
[334.56s] recovery mode as to be expected after
[336.68s] that strike anded in Dutch I want to go
[338.319s] back to you again talk about that fiscal
[340.039s] policy question mark As we are now you
[342.479s] know whatever 40 days away from from
[344.199s] inauguration day um you know you&#39;re
[346.319s] talking about those fiscal and policy
[348.08s] wild cards Dutch you know I do want to
[350.08s] get your take on you know on on federal
[353.039s] deficits and stimulus uh because you
[355.479s] know Biden is throwing out more student
[357.68s] debt payments uh he he made that
[359.68s] announcement today so there&#39;s more
[361.479s] fiscal SS going in more cost to
[363.6s] taxpayers on the other side you&#39;ve got
[366.0s] Elon Musk and B ramaswami and they&#39;re
[368.72s] focused on $2 trillion in Cuts uh and
[371.96s] getting the fiscal House in Washington
[374.12s] uh in order uh how do you play that
[376.24s] though as an investor as we
[378.72s] wait I would say that you
[381.88s] know you got to get long this Market
[385.199s] okay the Trump trade running out of
[387.639s] steam that&#39;s total gar
[390.12s] it hasn&#39;t even started yet look at this
[392.639s] dream team that he&#39;s put together what
[395.08s] happens if we cut government spending
[397.36s] rates come down and he&#39;s able to lower
[401.56s] the tax rates for individuals to next to
[404.759s] nothing this economy we the United
[408.199s] States will become the most dominant
[410.72s] player like ever on the planet that
[413.199s] we&#39;ve ever seen if they just let them do
[416.28s] this people will invest money in the
[418.68s] markets they will invest in people they
[421.16s] will grow their inventories they will
[423.599s] grow their businesses again we&#39;re just
[425.879s] getting started all right well we shall
[428.44s] see I mean certainly there&#39;s a lot of
[430.0s] excitement around in particular uh in my
[432.759s] mind especially with with dealing with
[434.479s] nearly $ 36 trillion dollars in debt
[436.16s] that this nation is sitting on can we
[437.599s] write the ship and Dutch you&#39;re saying
[439.56s] that we can and that would be great for
[441.199s] the markets obviously uh Dutch Masters
[443.68s] Thomas Hayes guys thank you so much it&#39;s
[445.479s] great to see you both today appreciate
[446.96s] your time um
[450.16s] and we&#39;re back and there we go ladies
[453.16s] and gentlemen Boeing is taking off pun
[456.919s] intended we&#39;ve been pounding the table
[459.12s] loading the boat that&#39;s one of our
[460.52s] largest positions just beginning and I
[463.4s] explained why then we had the money show
[467.68s] appearance in Sarasota this was really
[470.919s] incredible this was with Kim uh want to
[473.919s] thank Kim gitler Debbie Osborne Mike
[476.28s] Larson and Aaron West for having me
[479.0s] we&#39;re going to play this 30 second
[481.4s] segment nowas investment ideas um it
[484.599s] doesn&#39;t you know a lot of people will
[486.12s] talk about their picks but his research
[487.8s] really goes in depth really tells you
[489.479s] the why uh you know what catalysts are
[491.72s] for the turnarounds that he identifies
[493.44s] and so on so I think you&#39;re going to
[494.56s] enjoy his presentation again hedge fund
[497.0s] tips with Tom Hayes You&#39;ve seen him on
[498.919s] Fox Business uh you&#39;ve seen him on
[501.28s] podcast not just my own but his uh he&#39;s
[503.479s] specialized again in those finding those
[505.24s] undervalued names uh that have a
[507.479s] catalyst or multiple catalysts that you
[509.24s] know can help with the revaluation
[511.08s] really sort of the the Warren Buffett
[512.88s] approach to buying undervalued companies
[514.719s] so please give a very warm welcome to
[516.68s] Tom Hayes of great
[524.2s] G so good morning everyone good morning
[528.2s] okay has everyone had a great week here
[529.6s] a lot of
[530.519s] value yeah really want to give a hand to
[533.48s] Mike to Debbie to Kim to Aaron all the
[537.2s] people that put this together because
[539.0s] without them this wouldn&#39;t happen so
[540.399s] let&#39;s give them a
[544.48s] h so Brian bsky talked a little bit
[547.32s] about Jesus when he opened and uh a lot
[549.88s] of people when they look to make the
[551.399s] right decision they say what would Jesus
[554.88s] do I on the other hand When I Look to
[557.279s] make the right decision I say what would
[559.88s] Warren Buffett do and that&#39;s my
[562.279s] framework hands up who thinks Warren
[564.839s] Buffett is the greatest investor to ever
[567.88s] live I agree
[570.64s] and what we&#39;ve heard a lot this week is
[573.839s] about a lot of stocks and a lot of
[575.8s] opportunities that have gone up a lot
[578.48s] already okay and many of those will
[582.24s] continue to go up there&#39;s there&#39;s a
[583.76s] momentum type of investor and there&#39;s a
[586.24s] mean reversion type of investor I&#39;m in
[588.72s] the ladder Camp I like to buy
[590.24s] opportunities when they&#39;re on sale I say
[592.519s] Wall Street is the only place in the
[594.16s] world when they throw a clearance sale
[595.8s] everyone runs out of the store versus
[597.8s] into the store uh so we&#39;re going to talk
[600.44s] about a few Bargains and buying Bargains
[603.68s] is not for the faint of heart but if you
[606.399s] do accurate analysis and in-depth
[608.68s] analysis you can get tremendous returns
[610.959s] over time with patients with low
[613.399s] leverage and following a sensible
[615.68s] repeatable
[617.2s] framework
[618.92s] so a little bit about my backgrounds why
[621.48s] you should listen to me or not listen to
[623.48s] me uh I&#39;ve been doing this for a long
[626.32s] time one and a half decades in the hedge
[628.16s] fund business uh predominantly
[630.44s] concentrated Equity Longs we do do
[633.12s] tactical shorts from time to time when
[635.12s] we think the market is overvalued or
[637.48s] sector is overvalued or stock is
[639.079s] overvalued or we just want to dampen
[641.04s] volatility and we don&#39;t want to create
[642.48s] tax events for our clients um maybe you
[645.8s] see me on Fox Business I do cmbc
[648.12s] International I do Yahoo finance Etc and
[651.68s] hands up who saw the movie The Big
[653.72s] Short well prior to starting my own firm
[657.6s] I work for Brad pit okay in that movie
[661.2s] his name was Ben Ricket in the movie Ben
[663.839s] hocket in real life one of the smartest
[665.32s] guys I&#39;ve ever met uh phenomenal
[667.76s] experience at uh Cornwall Capital some
[670.2s] of the smartest guys in the room they
[672.32s] focus on asymmetric bets I can say he&#39;s
[675.0s] not quite as handsome in person but he&#39;s
[679.279s] much smarter than Brad Pit for sure
[683.04s] uh and prior to that I was um at Bedford
[686.76s] Oak advisor uh value shop the principal
[689.959s] was friends with buff for 40 years so I
[691.92s] have the privilege and blessing to
[694.44s] travel to Omaha every single year uh
[697.32s] some years on gabelli&#39;s private jet
[699.2s] which was unbelievable for a young
[700.76s] 30-some year old who grew up in New
[702.44s] Jersey carrying golf bags at the golf
[704.2s] course in the summer uh and Columbia
[706.6s] University so that&#39;s some background now
[710.12s] um we&#39; covered that we&#39;ve developed a
[713.04s] reputation over time of benefiting from
[715.639s] sector stock and General market
[718.079s] dislocations uh and periods of distress
[720.839s] that&#39;s kind of our knitting I got the
[722.88s] nickname turnaround Tom because of that
[725.04s] the people that have followed me for a
[726.279s] long time the people who know me in the
[727.8s] industry know I like to run in when
[730.2s] people are running out of the crowded
[731.639s] movie theater and see how many purses
[733.24s] were left on the chairs and those are
[735.12s] the opportunities uh to take advantage
[737.199s] of as Mike said we have hedge fund
[739.639s] tips.com WE Post our weekly podcast
[742.639s] there it&#39;s called hedge fun tips with
[744.56s] Tom Hayes very hard to remember uh it
[747.519s] has become it has toggled between the
[749.56s] one and two spot in the hedge fund
[751.399s] category for podcast it&#39;s been going for
[753.72s] 5 years 268 episodes and um what&#39;s
[758.36s] actually happened by mistake is all of
[761.36s] our clients have come in through
[763.68s] listening to that podcast and the phone
[765.76s] calls that I get are I&#39;ve been listening
[767.8s] to you for 3 months I&#39;ve been listening
[769.24s] to you for 6 months I&#39;ve been listening
[770.68s] to you for a year I&#39;ve been listening to
[772.32s] you for two years I&#39;ve made a ton of
[773.68s] money off your ideas I&#39;m going to send
[775.36s] you that money to manage because I&#39;m
[776.68s] running a business I&#39;m running a real
[778.079s] estate company have a career and um and
[781.32s] Etc so uh that&#39;s how we do that and we
[784.36s] make our money buying on weakness and
[786.079s] selling on strength I know that&#39;s
[787.48s] unpopular nowadays uh people like to buy
[790.24s] things that are strong and hope that
[791.6s] they get stronger and that&#39;s a strategy
[793.76s] it&#39;s just two different type of
[795.16s] strategies mean reversion is what we do
[797.839s] uh momentum counting on inertia is what
[800.36s] a lot lot of other people do uh and our
[803.24s] confidence to step in when others are
[804.72s] bailing is rooted in deep research and
[807.36s] the premise that the more price becomes
[809.839s] dislocated the more risk has actually
[812.76s] come out of the asset versus gone in you
[816.16s] know how many people feel like when a
[817.639s] stock is falling oh that&#39;s risky I
[819.88s] better not get in if the framework is
[822.839s] correct and it&#39;s a cash generative
[824.68s] company or God forbid the free cash flow
[827.36s] is actually growing before the
[828.959s] turnaround you&#39;re actually getting less
[831.639s] risk as the price comes down and you can
[833.959s] build a position over time uh most
[836.92s] participants see volatility as increased
[838.88s] risk
[839.68s] we view it as increased opportunities so
[842.8s] while many people look at the 52 we high
[844.72s] list for opportunities uh we look at the
[847.079s] 52 we low list not that&#39;s not our core
[849.639s] place but we always want to pay
[850.88s] attention to what sectors are down right
[853.399s] now why are they down do they deserve to
[856.0s] be down you know there are a lot of
[857.839s] things that are cheap for a reason and
[859.32s] you don&#39;t want to get caught in that
[860.399s] trap either and that&#39;s kind of the the
[862.44s] Special Sauce of doing it for so many
[864.72s] years you start to figure out okay that
[866.8s] sector no matter what happens you know a
[868.839s] lot commodity stocks no matter what
[870.399s] happens to the commodity they figure out
[871.88s] how to lose money all day long a lot of
[873.48s] mining stocks Etc um and this is kind of
[876.759s] the ethos of our firm and our philosophy
[879.88s] great investment opportunities come
[881.56s] around when excellent companies are
[883.16s] surrounded by unusual circumstances that
[886.04s] cause the stock to be Mis
[889.72s] appraised so uh some of you want to know
[892.16s] where the Market&#39;s going next that&#39;s
[893.56s] kind of not what we really do but we did
[896.639s] want to put a couple slides up um uh
[899.44s] this shows the Dow Jones Industrial
[901.199s] Average by year of the decade since 1897
[905.199s] so 120 years of data and what we see on
[908.519s] on average is uh like we saw in 2022
[911.839s] that was a down year the second year of
[913.6s] the decade TS on average is down and you
[916.839s] get some recovery in year three and four
[918.839s] like we&#39;ve seen in the last two years
[920.6s] and the middle part of the decade has a
[922.44s] tendency to be strong now you look at
[925.36s] this and say oh then I&#39;m going to go all
[927.04s] in we&#39;ve just had this no but you start
[929.279s] to say to yourself you look at the
[931.16s] presidential cycle tends to be the the
[934.24s] uh midterm elections you get a little
[935.92s] weakness so I think Jeff hirch said it
[938.319s] well yesterday he doesn&#39;t expect any
[940.8s] type of material weakness until
[942.959s] 2026 uh I think we probably get a little
[945.399s] bit of a pullback after the inauguration
[947.639s] if passes any prologue people are going
[950.16s] to want to hold their stocks till uh
[951.88s] through the end of the year but earnings
[953.959s] are good and bsky said double digigit
[956.36s] earnings growth double digit stock
[958.0s] markets I think our base case for next
[960.399s] year is somewhere between High single
[963.04s] digits maybe 6 7 8 9% for the S&amp;P to
[967.24s] potentially low double digits 12% is our
[969.56s] base case which implies you&#39;ll have your
[972.04s] 5 and 10% normal pullbacks maybe in in
[975.199s] the early part of the Year generally
[977.279s] after new new president gets in you get
[979.639s] the rally into the inauguration and then
[981.44s] you get the first four to six months
[982.959s] week that&#39;ll just be a time to find
[985.839s] opportunity uh big picture here this
[988.639s] just those long-term bull markets this
[990.68s] is a a slide from uh Robert sler over at
[993.72s] RBC and it shows you you know for the
[996.44s] last 100 some odd years you have 18 to
[998.959s] 20 years of consolidation followed by 18
[1001.759s] to 20 years of expansion 18 to 20 years
[1004.6s] of consolidation if you look at the 70s
[1006.959s] 18 to 20 years of expansion which was
[1009.399s] 1982 to
[1010.88s] 2000 uh consolidation and now we&#39;re
[1013.44s] about halfway through uh expansion so
[1017.16s] most people think well it must be the
[1018.6s] time
[1019.44s] it must be 2000 everyone&#39;s getting
[1021.48s] excited about paler everyone&#39;s getting
[1023.319s] excited about Nvidia we must crash I
[1025.48s] don&#39;t think that&#39;s the case and if you
[1027.88s] actually overlay demographics over this
[1031.28s] the commonality between the periods of
[1034.319s] uh consolidation like 1930 to 1948 1968
[1039.36s] to 1982 is demographics and right now we
[1042.439s] have very favorable demographics as many
[1044.559s] of you know uh the bulk of our
[1047.079s] population the echo is 33 34 years old
[1051.2s] housing formation family formation so
[1053.28s] we&#39;ve got a lot of gas in this tank and
[1054.88s] if sler is right uh a lot more upside I
[1057.799s] know Denny talks about 10,000 on the S&amp;P
[1060.72s] he&#39;s talking about just based on past
[1062.84s] Trends as high as 14,000 by the early
[1066.919s] 2030s okay turn around pick this is as
[1070.16s] boring as boring gets so if you get
[1072.0s] excited about CER you are going to fall
[1074.36s] asleep about Cooper standard and here&#39;s
[1076.72s] why they make the rubber ceiling that
[1080.2s] goes around the windows and the doors of
[1082.2s] automobiles okay who&#39;s excited about
[1084.76s] that all right so this was
[1088.24s] $146 stock in
[1092.48s] 2017 we started building a position for
[1095.28s] clients in May of 2022 we went public on
[1098.559s] Fox Business at around
[1100.84s] 550 and you say okay where where were
[1104.44s] you in 2022 why do you tell me about it
[1106.72s] now when the Stock&#39;s up 3x it&#39;s
[1109.32s] 200% uh about a $15 stock because it&#39;s
[1113.24s] been der risked and the story is just
[1115.48s] getting started so what was happening in
[1118.159s] 2017 is you had a sell through in the
[1120.799s] United States of about 17.5 million cars
[1125.72s] okay we fell in this cycle down to 15.3
[1130.2s] million if you go back over the last 45
[1134.0s] years every cycle uh pee troughs in the
[1138.08s] low 15 every cycle peaks in the high 17s
[1142.32s] to low 18 million right now we&#39;re at
[1145.919s] 15.8 million Sor the operating leverage
[1150.32s] of this business is such that they&#39;ve
[1153.36s] taken all the costs out of the business
[1156.0s] and every few hundred th000 few hundred
[1159.2s] th000 cars as we go from 158 of the
[1161.84s] bottom of the cycle to 177 half or 18 uh
[1166.48s] this business can generate $3 a share in
[1168.799s] earnings okay when we got involved with
[1171.799s] this stock you had something terrible
[1174.919s] called solvency risk okay those are two
[1178.44s] words you generally don&#39;t want to hear
[1180.0s] when you&#39;re getting into an investment
[1181.679s] they had to refinance about a billion
[1183.64s] dollars worth of debt in Fall of 2022
[1187.559s] and Legend over here David kotak who&#39;s
[1190.799s] one of the best Bond people in the
[1192.919s] business an absolute Legend over over
[1194.799s] decades I just had a chance to meet him
[1196.679s] he&#39;s going to speak next uh tell you in
[1199.679s] Fall of 2020 was not the best time to
[1202.64s] refinance high yield debt it was a scary
[1205.039s] time the markets were
[1206.679s] closed and uh we got in on the basis
[1211.08s] that they had more than enough asset
[1212.96s] coverage that they would get it done one
[1215.039s] way or another and number one number two
[1217.799s] there was a lot of private credit
[1219.08s] swirling around so if they couldn&#39;t get
[1220.6s] it done on their own uh we could find a
[1222.76s] way to get them in front of people with
[1223.96s] credit uh private credit to get it
[1225.4s] refinanced long story short they got it
[1227.72s] refinanced Goldman charged them an arm
[1229.88s] and a leg and three four five legs but
[1232.039s] they got it done uh refinance risk was
[1234.76s] off the table and the stock shot off you
[1237.0s] know $5 $10 it shot up to $20 uh now
[1240.919s] back to 15 now I&#39;d love to say I&#39;m a
[1243.4s] genius and I thought of this all by
[1245.039s] myself but when I was I I asked uh some
[1248.84s] people asked what is what would Jesus do
[1250.52s] I asked what would Warren do I also
[1252.08s] asked what would Charlie do and I copied
[1254.64s] this idea from Charlie Munger who did
[1256.4s] the exact same trade in one of the six
[1258.6s] cycal Auto troughs in 2001 with a little
[1262.0s] company called tenaco okay who&#39;s heard
[1264.76s] of Monroe shock absorbers Dynamax
[1267.52s] exhaust products Etc and here&#39;s the
[1270.2s] beauty of what Charlie did he read an
[1271.919s] article in Barons uh about Teno having
[1275.559s] to refinance about a billion dollar of
[1277.279s] debt and he put $10 million into the
[1281.08s] equity and from that 10 million when
[1283.559s] they got refinanced and the cycle came
[1285.32s] back he turned the 10 million into 80
[1288.039s] million
[1289.52s] and then he gave the 80 million to a guy
[1291.4s] named leelu to who started investing in
[1294.32s] China when no one was interested in
[1295.88s] China and you turn the 80 million into a
[1298.52s] half a billion so two chess moves a half
[1301.76s] a billion dollars who&#39;s interested in
[1303.24s] that okay so was Charlie buying the
[1305.72s] things that were already up 10x 20x 30X
[1309.12s] or was he buying the things that were
[1311.0s] out of favor that had a catalyst to turn
[1313.36s] around to take advantage the ladder
[1316.36s] right so that&#39;s exactly what&#39;s happening
[1319.159s] right now with Cooper standard we&#39;ve met
[1321.159s] with management multi mult multiple
[1323.2s] times we have confidence in their
[1325.159s] abilities um they also a lot of times
[1328.48s] when these small cap companies get into
[1329.88s] trouble they don&#39;t respect Equity so
[1332.48s] they issue a lot of shares they dilute
[1334.4s] the shareholders they&#39;ve actually
[1336.2s] brought the share count down while going
[1338.36s] through one of the most difficult
[1339.6s] periods in the Auto industry this is
[1341.44s] turning up we&#39;ve already tough the
[1343.2s] operating leverage they&#39;re now at break
[1344.84s] even they&#39;ve taken $500 million of cost
[1347.12s] out of the business as you see and the
[1350.36s] the number one leading indicator of
[1353.48s] Industry Auto volume for new cars is
[1356.76s] incentives okay and you&#39;ll see here
[1360.36s] incentives first off this chart on the
[1363.24s] top is the global light vehicle
[1365.88s] production forecast so as you can see
[1367.96s] this is very conservative right now
[1369.44s] because people are still pessimistic
[1371.0s] they expect it to go back to 2017 levels
[1374.919s] uh by 2028 we think it&#39;s going to happen
[1377.52s] sooner but on that
[1379.559s] basis um Cooper standard at that peak
[1382.96s] level earned $7 a share $719 a share and
[1386.679s] earnings in 2017 the stock traded at
[1390.32s] $146 we believe when we get those type
[1392.88s] of volumes whether it&#39;s 2027 or 2028
[1396.679s] based on how the business has been uh
[1399.36s] better managed they&#39;re going to earn
[1401.2s] well more than $7 a share they could
[1402.84s] earn $10 a share and Beyond and the only
[1405.24s] question is what multiple is going to be
[1407.12s] applied to the stock a off multiple of
[1409.08s] 10 times or a peak multiple of 20 times
[1411.44s] so we think it&#39;s it&#39;s got huge upside
[1414.12s] even from $15 never mind $5 this will be
[1417.2s] a 10 to 15 bagg or overtime for us um so
[1420.76s] that&#39;s that that&#39;s the incentives you
[1422.6s] can see going straight up our and if you
[1426.039s] thought that one was hairy okay I got
[1428.08s] one that&#39;s even hairier for you it&#39;s
[1429.44s] called Advanced Auto Parts you guys ever
[1431.08s] seen an advanced auto parts in your
[1433.12s] neighborhood okay this is the worst
[1435.32s] performing Auto retailer of all three
[1438.0s] Okay so whether you&#39;re talking about
[1439.36s] O&#39;Reilly etc etc the good news is they
[1443.12s] probably have the best CEO who&#39;s just
[1444.96s] come in his name is Shane o Kelly he ran
[1447.24s] HD Supply in uh for for Home Depot uh $7
[1451.84s] billion business he&#39;s got a military
[1453.72s] background Harvard part business school
[1455.559s] he knows how to run these businesses and
[1458.6s] what he&#39;s basically done is he took
[1461.88s] solvency risk off the table recently by
[1464.799s] selling the Canadian business that was
[1466.64s] non- synergistic he created a $1.5
[1469.0s] billion doar in cash for that net
[1471.279s] 1.2 uh paying down debt so he&#39;s brought
[1473.88s] the leverage ratios down to buy him time
[1475.84s] for the turn around and then he closed
[1477.919s] 10% of the stores on the west coast that
[1480.72s] were all spread out so you see that
[1484.0s] footprint of all the red dots all of
[1486.96s] those on the east coast is great where
[1489.48s] in most markets they&#39;re number one or
[1491.08s] number two and they have synergies and
[1492.76s] they have uh opportunity to really
[1494.679s] generate cash they closed they sold to
[1497.12s] Canada paid down the balance sheet they
[1499.76s] closed 700 stores on the west coast that
[1501.76s] were all spread out and now they&#39;re
[1503.48s] going to lower the the distribution
[1505.32s] centers from 38
[1507.24s] to13 uh he expects to increase operating
[1510.559s] margins by 500 basis points over the
[1512.76s] next few years what that means in
[1514.919s] English they&#39;re going to generate $600
[1517.799s] million in operating income and on that
[1521.679s] basis the last two three times that they
[1525.0s] generated $600 million plus of operating
[1527.679s] income was 2018 2019 and
[1531.24s] 2022 the stock is currently 45 bucks uh
[1536.76s] in those instances when they were
[1538.2s] generating that type of operating income
[1540.159s] the stock was $186 $182 and $240 I&#39;m not
[1545.08s] saying that it&#39;s going to go back there
[1547.12s] but I am saying there&#39;s an enormous
[1549.0s] opportunity again operating leverage
[1551.6s] Catalyst it&#39;s been der risked solvency
[1554.36s] risk has come off the table they sold
[1555.919s] off non-core assets same same type of
[1558.399s] story and this is how we can create
[1560.96s] doubles triples and stuff over a
[1562.559s] reasonable amount of time be patient
[1564.799s] build the position and wait good things
[1566.76s] come to those who wait right um and then
[1569.96s] finally is Etsy who&#39;s heard of
[1573.12s] etsy okay so you have two choices in the
[1576.0s] next three weeks you can go on to Amazon
[1578.399s] you can scatter shot a bunch of
[1579.799s] chocolate baskets that&#39;s no one ever
[1581.44s] going to eat unpersonalized your
[1583.6s] business clients your family is going to
[1585.48s] say oh yeah you did the minimum
[1587.44s] congratulations
[1588.84s] uh you thought of me barely uh or you
[1592.159s] can go on to Etsy and get them something
[1594.0s] beautifully engraved with the most
[1596.08s] important thing to every single person
[1598.279s] with their own name on it okay and get a
[1600.52s] customized thing and they&#39;ve built a
[1602.399s] tremendous business in doing customized
[1604.88s] stuff it was a covid darling the stock
[1607.6s] ran up to over $300 a share it&#39;s now uh
[1611.64s] we initiate at $49 I think it&#39;s still
[1614.6s] what is it what is it Jeff $49 55
[1618.84s] okay so uh so we&#39;re up on that one
[1621.84s] barely uh but here&#39;s the name of the
[1624.159s] game ladies and gentlemen when I talk
[1625.559s] about a framework looking under the
[1627.76s] surface and understanding what you buy I
[1629.88s] think about it in terms of private
[1631.559s] equity in the public markets what would
[1633.64s] I pay for the entire business if JP
[1636.12s] Morgan was going to finance me to buy
[1637.76s] the whole company and I had to put 100%
[1639.96s] of my net worth up for the equity of the
[1642.24s] purchase um look at the free those
[1645.36s] purple bars are the free cash generation
[1648.84s] of etsy so does it look like the free
[1651.6s] cash flow has gone down a whole lot
[1653.679s] since the stock was trading at
[1656.24s] $300 okay so if the stock was priced you
[1659.72s] know Mr Market is a manic depressive and
[1662.32s] AIC euphoric okay so you&#39;re seeing a
[1664.36s] little bit of the manic euphorics uh a
[1666.36s] little bit uh this week and and some of
[1668.76s] the manic depresses and stock like this
[1671.24s] but you know when I look at this if you
[1674.32s] were going to go buy 10 Jersey Mike&#39;s
[1676.96s] franchises is that Big Dam here at the
[1678.48s] Subway
[1680.279s] shop and you know you looked at the guy
[1683.48s] you would look at the financials by the
[1684.799s] way I know a lot of people don&#39;t like to
[1686.279s] look at financials before they buy a
[1687.48s] stock but if you were going to buy a
[1688.559s] whole business you would look at the
[1689.76s] financials right and if the free cash
[1692.84s] flow the amount back to owners back to
[1695.2s] you as the purchaser was basically the
[1697.519s] same over the last 10
[1699.519s] years would you try to buy it at
[1702.799s] 20% of what it was worth a few years ago
[1705.48s] the guy would literally call security
[1707.48s] guards and have you escorted out of the
[1709.76s] building because you were insulting and
[1711.36s] you were completely irrational except
[1714.12s] every day in the public markets you get
[1716.279s] opportunities like this where if you
[1718.96s] would actually present it to the board
[1720.48s] I&#39;ll buy the whole company at the price
[1722.799s] that it&#39;s quoted in the market they
[1724.36s] would call security and have you think
[1726.0s] you were a Looney Tune but that happens
[1728.12s] every day so stock price down 80% free
[1732.279s] cash flow generation to
[1734.44s] owners not only about par puru with when
[1738.679s] it was a $300 stock uh but re
[1741.919s] accelerating growth they&#39;re turning it
[1743.72s] around they did make some mistakes but
[1745.919s] they did keep 92 million users it&#39;s the
[1749.08s] fourth most trafficed website on for
[1753.039s] e-commerce site in the US how many of
[1754.96s] you knew that Etsy I had no idea I asked
[1758.48s] my wife what is Etsy does anyone use it
[1760.84s] um and that&#39;s one of their initiatives
[1762.799s] loyalty programs they&#39;re they&#39;re
[1764.279s] initiating downloaded apps gifting
[1767.32s] International all of these initiatives
[1769.64s] and Josh Silverman who is the CEO has a
[1773.039s] proven track record of winning when he
[1775.2s] was at Skype they increased users by 300
[1778.039s] million in just a few years uh he&#39;s got
[1780.6s] a track record of many successful
[1782.36s] companies and he&#39;s going to do the exact
[1783.919s] same thing at Etsy through some of these
[1787.32s] initiatives um so men International
[1791.919s] gifting loyalty program apps download
[1794.84s] and cleaning up the curation of the
[1796.44s] website Etc there was was a period there
[1799.679s] for a couple of years where they had
[1801.76s] some counterfeit and cheap products and
[1803.96s] that kind of turned people off they&#39;re
[1805.84s] fixing that problem you know I had a an
[1807.799s] anchor asked me like uh are they doing a
[1811.039s] good job and I said the answer is no the
[1812.84s] stock&#39;s down 85% uh that&#39;s the bad news
[1816.32s] the good news is they recognize the
[1818.08s] problem they&#39;re fixing it and we&#39;re
[1819.44s] seeing re accelerating growth and this
[1822.559s] is a phenomenal Niche platform the other
[1824.88s] reason I like it it&#39;s not a me too
[1827.48s] platform where everyone&#39;s selling the
[1829.12s] same product and it&#39;s a race to the
[1831.399s] bottom with price and margins which
[1833.32s] you&#39;re never going to win against Amazon
[1834.919s] right they don&#39;t have to have the same
[1836.84s] type of margin here it&#39;s bestok products
[1839.44s] it&#39;s custom products it&#39;s gifted
[1841.64s] products it&#39;s supporting small
[1843.799s] businesses uh and the runway is just
[1846.2s] getting started if you look at the total
[1847.76s] addressable Market Etc um by the way
[1851.12s] anytime you hear in investment
[1852.96s] presentation if you hear the word total
[1855.2s] addressable Market what they&#39;re trying
[1857.44s] to tell you is here&#39;s why you should pay
[1860.0s] 20 times sales for this business run the
[1863.039s] other way but in this case uh it&#39;s
[1865.24s] trading at a meaningful discount and
[1867.36s] they have a very small percentage of
[1868.799s] this this growing uh and narrow group
[1871.799s] and I have one final bonus stock uh
[1875.559s] turnaround Tom pick for you today and uh
[1879.24s] that is oh by the
[1880.919s] way uh my analyst Jeff put this
[1884.399s] beautiful slide together uh they&#39;re
[1886.679s] generating about 600 million of free
[1888.76s] cash flow every single year does that
[1890.76s] sound like they have solvency risk no
[1893.639s] okay balance sheet is delevered the the
[1896.039s] free cash flow is growing over the next
[1897.799s] 5 years they&#39;re going to generate uh
[1900.84s] about enough cash where you could buy in
[1903.44s] 60% of the stock they just announced a$1
[1905.84s] billion buyback authorization so um you
[1909.159s] know 1.2 billion of cash on the balance
[1911.039s] sheet 2.3 billion long-term debt re
[1913.72s] accelerating growth we like these type
[1915.44s] of opportunities and finally is Boeing
[1918.519s] you can&#39;t give away this stock people
[1920.36s] are trading it like it&#39;s going out of
[1922.039s] business uh except they&#39;ve got a new CEO
[1925.44s] Kelly orberg who when he was at Rockwell
[1927.96s] Collins in six years he forx the company
[1931.279s] for owners he made them four times their
[1933.48s] money in six years this guy is an
[1935.36s] absolute winner they&#39;ve solved the issue
[1937.24s] with the unions and by the way they&#39;ve
[1939.96s] got a half a trillion dollar backlog the
[1942.679s] demand for flying is going up not down
[1944.919s] China&#39;s going to double their Fleet by
[1946.44s] 2043
[1948.039s] and they&#39;ve got a half a trillion
[1949.88s] dollars of backlog imagine if your
[1951.76s] Jersey Mike Subway franchises had 10
[1954.36s] years worth of backlog for sandwiches
[1956.96s] you know orders already in que already
[1959.48s] uh committed already paid for and there
[1962.12s] was no other Subway shop that they could
[1963.919s] go to if they got tired of waiting uh in
[1966.279s] the case of Boeing you got Boeing you
[1967.919s] got Airbus we like duopolistic and
[1969.96s] oligopolistic businesses that have
[1971.88s] pricing power Boeing is one of those we
[1974.279s] see a tremendous opportunity there and
[1976.96s] then uh finally
[1978.88s] uh this is how to reach
[1980.48s] me uh the the podcast is the best way to
[1984.12s] get value from you for free just tune in
[1986.48s] and listen you can get that anywhere you

[1990.039s] because I got go through a lot of charts
[1991.88s] data spreadsheets Etc hedge fund tips
[1994.6s] with Tom Hayes Twitter is hedge fund
[1997.08s] tips the YouTube is the way to get me at
[1999.519s] hedge fund tips email and phone number
[2002.0s] and as always this is opinion not advice
[2005.72s] uh we deal exclusively with ultra net
[2008.039s] worth uh individuals and family offices
[2011.279s] uh so talk to your financial advisor
[2012.919s] before you do anything and happy to take
[2015.279s] any questions we&#39;ll do one or two
[2016.76s] questions now and Tom&#39;s going to be on
[2017.96s] the panel later so if you don&#39;t get a
[2019.279s] chance to ask now we&#39;ll definitely have
[2020.639s] some time for that I&#39;m standing here
[2022.96s] with the
[2023.76s] microphone so Amazon is what the biggest
[2027.36s] company really for
[2028.919s] consumers there these Chinese companies
[2031.799s] coming in Shen and T and are there are
[2036.08s] there investment opportuni with those as
[2040.24s] well uh you opened up a can of worms
[2042.679s] because if I start talking about Alibaba
[2044.519s] today we&#39;re going to be here till 4:00
[2047.2s] look uh we&#39;ve got a tremendous uh
[2050.24s] position in Alibaba okay and this has
[2052.639s] taken longer than we&#39;ve expected to work
[2055.24s] but we&#39;ve had an opportunity to bring
[2056.48s] down our basis in our view it&#39;s
[2059.359s] the uh best price is what you pay values
[2062.44s] what you get we we think it&#39;s the best
[2063.879s] opportunity globally they international
[2065.76s] business to your point Alibaba Express
[2067.72s] is growing at 30% pindu Duo is a
[2070.24s] competitor with timu uh I think timu if
[2075.04s] uh pindu do I believe their numbers are
[2077.0s] either unsustainable or unreliable and
[2079.119s] you&#39;re seeing them get shut down in a
[2080.56s] lot of markets like Vietnam Alibaba does
[2082.96s] quality business and Alibaba will is the
[2085.2s] toll taker in China if you believe that
[2087.48s] the government will continue to do
[2088.8s] stimulus if you believe that they will
[2090.56s] recover like they do every cycle just
[2092.24s] like Autos recover every cycle uh and
[2095.639s] it&#39;s the cheapest covert play in China
[2099.52s] because they are the number one cloud
[2101.24s] provider and what they do is with every
[2103.2s] AI startup they say don&#39;t worry about it
[2105.4s] you don&#39;t have to give us money we&#39;ll
[2106.76s] give you compute power which costs us
[2108.48s] basically nothing you give us Equity so
[2110.8s] they&#39;ve got equity in every single
[2113.119s] startup AI startup in China and that&#39;s
[2116.52s] given zero value right now on the stock
[2118.359s] price you&#39;re going to see some of these
[2119.48s] things be thousand Baggers and we own
[2121.119s] them indirectly as owners of alib so we
[2123.88s] that&#39;s a perfect play and it&#39;s one of
[2125.44s] our largest positions so your spot on
[2128.079s] we&#39;ll do one more
[2129.48s] yeah what do you think about super micro
[2132.24s] at will they get their financial
[2133.76s] reporting issues taken care of and their
[2136.28s] future please uh super micro
[2139.96s] wow
[2141.8s] um you know that was one when it was
[2144.28s] going straight up I said what would
[2146.76s] Jesus do and then I said well Jesus
[2148.76s] didn&#39;t give me an answer I said okay
[2150.04s] what would Warren Buffet do and uh and
[2153.8s] Warren Buffet would in touch him with a
[2154.96s] 10ft pole so we took a pass as far as as
[2157.92s] companies that have accounting
[2159.4s] irregularities that is a huge red flag
[2162.599s] um obviously there&#39;s substance to their
[2165.24s] underlying business but when you have
[2168.4s] that type of thing it&#39;s a don&#39;t touch
[2170.079s] and and I live my life under a very
[2173.16s] simple framework I am perfectly
[2174.96s] comfortable with making errors of
[2177.2s] omission like I I have no fomo fomo is
[2180.8s] not in my DNA like if if I see someone
[2182.76s] make a 100x on something that I wasn&#39;t
[2184.56s] participant like I&#39;m super happy for
[2187.119s] them like I don&#39;t think my way is the
[2188.68s] only way I just figured out after doing
[2190.4s] it long enough I&#39;m really good at one
[2191.92s] little thing and this is what I&#39;m good
[2193.48s] at and I just do that and there are tons
[2196.0s] of ways to make money so um the short
[2199.319s] answer to your question is I don&#39;t touch
[2200.839s] companies that have a history of
[2202.48s] accounting irregularities it&#39;s just a
[2204.0s] don&#39;t touch because you know if you see
[2206.359s] a few cockroaches you don&#39;t know how
[2207.96s] much damage is underneath the sheetrock
[2210.76s] and uh and touched it exactly the wrong
[2213.2s] moment what&#39;s that what if you touched
[2215.48s] it at exactly
[2217.72s] it you&#39;re in it and deciding what
[2219.64s] exactly the wrong moment right before
[2222.28s] the problem oh okay right before the
[2225.0s] problem sometimes you got to take your
[2226.72s] lumps we all do um I would I would I
[2229.96s] would say two things number one is if
[2231.8s] you&#39;re going to harvest a loss do you
[2233.359s] have if you have gains in other stocks
[2235.2s] that you&#39;re going to be paying tax on
[2236.68s] next year you might want to harvest that
[2238.72s] loss and use that use that tax asset
[2241.16s] against the games now&#39;s a good time to
[2243.64s] do it before the end of the year uh
[2245.16s] opinion not advice um
[2248.24s] but if you&#39;re going to hold on to it you
[2250.88s] better get on the conference calls and
[2252.44s] be very darn sure that you feel
[2255.079s] comfortable that the the error was
[2258.44s] explainable rational and you feel
[2261.48s] comfortable in the financials and then
[2262.92s] again prices what you pay what you get
[2264.4s] even though it&#39;s fallen down what is the
[2267.079s] value of it how much you know is it are
[2269.88s] you comfortable with the current
[2270.88s] valuation assuming that it&#39;s correct uh
[2273.44s] but for me I I I run the other way from
[2276.079s] some of those guys yeah I think that&#39;s
[2278.16s] it thank you very
[2284.68s] much and we&#39;re back and then we had a
[2289.28s] segment uh panel segment which I would
[2292.4s] strongly encourage you to listen to you
[2294.079s] can find it on YouTube Just Google hedge
[2296.16s] fund tips it&#39;s called part two the panel
[2299.04s] that was with Mish Schneider who you see
[2303.52s] all the time on Charles P on Fox
[2306.44s] Business uh great to be on with her and
[2308.839s] Legend Sam stoval who&#39;s been a market
[2311.96s] strategist also had dinner with him uh
[2315.16s] and Jose Torres from interactive brokers
[2317.92s] at the Scott Walker uh former Scott
[2320.64s] Walker uh governor of Wisconsin event on
[2324.319s] Thursday night this was a great segment
[2326.92s] but we&#39;re not going to take 30 minutes
[2328.16s] to play it I would encourage you because
[2330.119s] we go in depth into Emerging Markets
[2332.64s] China and you might find that very
[2335.68s] helpful we just have too many amas and
[2337.64s] stuff to get through today and finally
[2339.359s] want to thank Deborah Sophia for
[2340.72s] including me in her article
[2343.359s] on uh Google on to the data S&amp;P 500&#39;s
[2349.2s] price tobook ratio approaches approaches
[2352.4s] Tech bubble Peak look if you listen
[2356.44s] carefully to my
[2357.88s] presentation I alluded to the fact that
[2361.04s] 99% of the speakers that I saw over
[2364.2s] those 3 days were talking about things
[2366.24s] that have already gone up a ton as if
[2369.8s] they&#39;re the newest best idea ever and
[2372.24s] none of them or few of them were to be
[2374.44s] found at the bottom in the hole in Fall
[2377.28s] of 2022 when we were buying Amazon and
[2380.72s] Google and made easy
[2383.64s] doubles so it&#39;s just something to be
[2386.319s] cognizant of it doesn&#39;t mean it can&#39;t go
[2388.119s] more it just says some of these
[2390.52s] valuations on the concentrated magev are
[2395.16s] stretched as a matter of fact one of the
[2397.0s] things going to talk about today is the
[2398.88s] fact that since I posted that article on
[2402.359s] June
[2403.839s] 20th uh with Jenson Wong on the on the
[2406.92s] cover of the article you can go back to
[2408.599s] hedge fund tips commentary signing that
[2411.44s] girl&#39;s front area with a marker uh
[2416.52s] Nvidia has had negative returns since
[2421.8s] June of this year and you would not
[2424.119s] guess that based on the continued
[2426.0s] Euphoria around around the stock okay
[2429.599s] and um it&#39;s something to be cognizant of
[2432.079s] so Price to Book Tech bubble Peak it
[2435.319s] doesn&#39;t mean we&#39;re going to crash or
[2436.88s] Tech&#39;s going to crash or anything like
[2438.319s] that I think it does mean they are going
[2441.4s] to
[2442.4s] underperform relative to the
[2445.44s] unmagnify and xus and we&#39;re going to
[2448.68s] talk about some reasons why this is
[2451.8s] beauty to my eyes this is the Cox
[2454.48s] Automotive incentives are booming we
[2458.44s] jumped up again I think we at 7.6 last
[2461.48s] time we&#39;re at
[2463.0s] 8% of sales price sales prices ticked up
[2466.72s] a hair but they&#39;ve been basically
[2468.24s] flatlining for the last two plus years
[2470.76s] incentives are going up what is the
[2472.4s] number one key indicator of future
[2475.56s] volumes is incentives and this is
[2478.92s] exciting especially when we got a 16.5
[2481.28s] mil SAR number last month uh when you
[2485.359s] annualize it out we are moving in the
[2487.72s] right direction as po per my
[2489.68s] presentation but this data is new as of
[2491.92s] today uh annual new stock BuyBacks
[2495.28s] continue to climb overall distressed
[2498.24s] rates by property type you&#39;ll see that
[2501.64s] office is still climbing a little bit
[2504.28s] retail is leveling off and Self Storage
[2507.8s] is rolling over as well as industrial
[2510.2s] rolling over you had a little bit of
[2512.04s] spike in the summer and that&#39;s come back
[2514.24s] down 007 Wells Fargo SE the S&amp;P 500 at
[2520.16s] 7,7 in 2025 highest forecast on Wall
[2524.119s] Street so again this is stuff that you
[2526.92s] see all the time opinion follows Trend
[2530.24s] which um leads me to believe it&#39;s
[2534.079s] probably overshooting in the short term
[2536.88s] we&#39;re going to talk about some targets
[2538.4s] out there uh our base case is 8 to 12%
[2541.76s] next year maybe a little lower because
[2545.24s] the index is so impact Ed by the weights
[2547.92s] of the mag 7 and we think they&#39;re going
[2549.359s] to perform less well along with the
[2551.76s] closet indexers and we&#39;ll talk about why
[2554.319s] it has to do with correlations which are
[2556.24s] at an all-time low us beige book
[2559.44s] activity index that&#39;s turning back up uh
[2562.559s] says economy stable companies more
[2564.24s] optimistic about 2025 but tariffs a
[2566.52s] worry what you saw from Trump number one
[2569.16s] he extended an a long Olive Branch to
[2571.48s] xiin Ping this week by inviting him to
[2574.48s] his inauguration number one and number
[2577.4s] two he&#39;s put people around him that
[2582.04s] understand that if we destroy China it&#39;s
[2586.04s] mutually assured destruction and uh
[2589.28s] certainly we want to extract more
[2591.319s] tariffs and put America First and at the
[2594.16s] same time we want to benefit when we can
[2596.48s] benefit from those areas that we we want
[2599.599s] to uh get certain Goods at lower cost
[2602.4s] that are you know we&#39;re unwilling to
[2604.8s] produce here and uh and there&#39;s a uh
[2609.0s] beneficial nature to that type of
[2611.359s] relationship and I&#39;m sure they&#39;ll find
[2613.319s] their way to the table you know starting
[2616.319s] at 60% then dropping to 25% then
[2619.079s] inviting to the inauguration you can see
[2621.0s] a trend here if you&#39;re paying attention
[2623.359s] trailing 12- Monon PE ratios I don&#39;t
[2626.68s] tend to look at a lot of trailing but
[2629.28s] you can see Tech is above their
[2631.28s] historical
[2632.52s] median
[2635.52s] um you got us m&amp;a at a low just getting
[2639.079s] ready to tick up that&#39;s not something
[2641.04s] you see right before recessions what you
[2643.0s] see is a dramatic acceleration and I
[2644.92s] think we&#39;re going to start that dramatic
[2647.16s] acceleration of m&amp;a in the next 12 to 24
[2650.48s] months uh which puts the next cycle
[2653.319s] short-term top out uh probably a couple
[2655.88s] years from now uh I think the
[2659.079s] rockiness is more likely in
[2663.96s] 2026 and a bit in 2020 7 more likely
[2668.4s] than not than it is in 2025 even though
[2671.76s] we&#39;ll probably scare a few people early
[2674.04s] in the
[2676.92s] year um you see the Chinese uh CSI
[2682.16s] 300 breaking out back testing trying to
[2685.8s] move ahead this week I think we&#39;re going
[2687.28s] to start to see some follow through if
[2689.359s] past is any prologue we&#39;ve covered it
[2691.24s] multiple times in the last two
[2693.4s] weeks um what you see is is you
[2699.48s] see uh as soon as the calendar turned
[2702.119s] before the inauguration last time um
[2705.119s] massive massive spike in
[2709.599s] um moving along again that skew index is
[2714.04s] elevated last time we were that elevated
[2716.44s] you saw a selloff in Tech in 2022 and
[2720.839s] value stocks outperform so something to
[2722.76s] keep in the back of your mind uh what we
[2725.88s] worry
[2727.44s] percent of investors who think there&#39;s
[2729.119s] less than a 10% probability of a crash
[2732.4s] let me see if I can make this a little
[2733.76s] bit bigger for you ladies and gentlemen
[2735.52s] there you
[2736.599s] go uh right here record 30 billion
[2739.64s] inflow into small cap funds surpassing
[2743.24s] 29 billion in 2021 so that game starting
[2746.359s] to go I will say I&#39;m keeping an eye on
[2750.64s] our
[2752.04s] kre small cap you know we took profits
[2755.2s] on Bank of America and
[2757.76s] City over the summer after big
[2760.44s] moves um I think K&#39;s got some more juice
[2765.16s] and there&#39;s going to be a lot of
[2766.04s] consolidation but it&#39;s also had a huge
[2768.2s] move so I&#39;m going to keep an eye on that
[2769.8s] after the beginning of the
[2771.319s] year
[2773.079s] uh annual distribution of S&amp;P total
[2776.119s] returns over the
[2777.76s] last 100 years so you can see those
[2781.559s] years that had 15 to 20% returns 30 to
[2786.92s] to 35% returns 30 to 35
[2790.839s] happened uh looks like 11% of the time
[2794.96s] and the bell curve here so uh these
[2797.44s] years are you know not normal but
[2800.599s] they&#39;re not completely outside the realm
[2803.52s] of possibility and if you look at the
[2805.04s] late 90s which we&#39;re going to do today
[2807.079s] you&#39;ll see they were several years
[2808.599s] strung together at that level uh this is
[2811.2s] a different chart of that S&amp;P 500 Price
[2813.96s] to Book ratio now exceeds the March 2000
[2816.52s] High
[2817.4s] so you look you got to just respect this
[2819.599s] now you could say to me uh well that was
[2822.359s] a different time the businesses were
[2824.079s] more Capital intensive you know there&#39;s
[2827.92s] something to be said for that but at the
[2830.68s] same time just pay attention that&#39;s all
[2832.599s] this stuff runs in Cycles uh all regions
[2835.68s] have now experienced a rise in
[2836.839s] valuations through 2024 where is the
[2839.24s] most amount of value for the least
[2840.44s] amount of price uh in the scale relative
[2843.119s] to history and on absolute terms is
[2844.839s] China that is going to be the surp one
[2846.559s] of the surprises of 2025 it&#39;s going to
[2849.319s] work like magic just like right after
[2850.92s] Trump got elected in 2027 after the
[2853.64s] inauguration it took
[2856.359s] off scenario us Equity sector impact
[2859.76s] from Mass deportation so the
[2862.64s] impact uh will be the greatest from uh
[2866.88s] agriculture construction and Hospitality
[2868.92s] are hurt the
[2870.64s] most Capital markets liquidity is just
[2873.96s] starting to recover this is what you see
[2877.119s] after troughs we are nowhere near the
[2879.96s] peak liquidity when you get up to 67%
[2882.88s] like you did in 2007 2008 and 2021
[2887.4s] before you got a
[2888.599s] selloff um and 2000 before you got the
[2892.319s] tech wack so we&#39;re just coming off the
[2894.8s] mat here that&#39;s that&#39;s why there&#39;s a lot
[2896.4s] of gas in the tank and that&#39;s why we
[2897.72s] don&#39;t see anything material 10%
[2900.0s] pullbacks all day long we&#39;re going to
[2901.359s] get one of those next year for sure um
[2904.72s] but you know big pullbacks 20% bare
[2907.0s] markets I think that&#39;s going to be
[2908.28s] pushed off to late 26 if not
[2911.2s] 2027 so When the Music&#39;s dancing you got
[2914.24s] to get up When the Music&#39;s playing you
[2916.119s] got to get up and dance uh credit
[2918.76s] spread&#39;s coming down here is another
[2920.64s] reason you do not want to get bearish
[2922.8s] into a global easing Cycle Central
[2925.319s] bank&#39;s cutting rates at the fastest Pace
[2927.44s] since May 20 64 Cuts already this 62
[2931.68s] Cuts already this year just getting
[2934.04s] started last two times may have two 20
[2937.44s] May of 2000 we were pound the table
[2939.64s] buyers April of 2009 these were times to
[2943.559s] be buyers not
[2944.96s] sellers uh currently takes 8 months on
[2948.16s] average to build a single family house
[2951.92s] uh so that
[2953.559s] has started to rise again in the last
[2957.24s] four years that could have something to
[2959.4s] do with supplies it could have something
[2960.799s] to do with regulation uh hopefully they
[2963.52s] can make it easier to get zoning and get
[2965.96s] the supply that we need going and this
[2968.319s] will start to come down and that will be
[2969.92s] positive for affordability for young
[2971.599s] people trying to start a family
[2973.92s] encourage more people to have babies
[2975.599s] which we need as a
[2977.24s] society um this is the spread between
[2980.96s] the household survey and the
[2982.799s] establishment survey so while the
[2985.16s] establishment survey for the employment
[2987.04s] levels was positive under the surface it
[2989.319s] wasn&#39;t that great which is why you&#39;re
[2991.64s] seeing 96% odds of a hike excuse me 90%
[2998.079s] odds of a cut next week and I think
[3001.16s] that&#39;s all we&#39;re going to need for a
[3002.4s] while and I think after that I think
[3004.44s] they can play the wait and see game and
[3006.359s] maybe sit on their hands until March and
[3009.559s] one two more Cuts in 2025 and we&#39;re done
[3012.4s] we got a midcycle uh intervention they
[3015.16s] went big early and uh they saved the day
[3018.64s] and uh I think that Powell is going to
[3022.04s] go out like Seinfeld at the top and um
[3025.799s] do exactly what he wanted to do it&#39;s not
[3027.359s] to say inflation&#39;s not going to come
[3029.2s] back in fits and starts but I think he&#39;s
[3030.96s] going to largely be able to declare
[3033.839s] Victory uh and part of that&#39;s going to
[3035.839s] be a function of Doge cutting cost we&#39;re
[3038.92s] going to talk about that as
[3041.4s] well Mark this is the us6 unemployment
[3044.44s] rate underemployment has been going up
[3047.319s] since 2022 so keeping an eye on that
[3049.799s] that should keep the FED easy for a
[3051.48s] little while longer well into
[3055.079s] 2025 um rate cut in December we&#39; covered
[3058.24s] that two-year yields yields dropped they
[3061.599s] they kind of did a dead cap bounce here
[3063.359s] in the last few days but they&#39;ve been
[3064.72s] coming down since November as we
[3066.2s] anticipated bonds get bid in November
[3068.88s] December and that should follow through
[3071.0s] in 2025 consumer sentiment is ticking up
[3074.24s] since the
[3075.4s] election
[3078.359s] um here&#39;s the Nvidia okay so it peaked
[3081.88s] out at
[3083.119s] 14074 literally the day before I wrote
[3085.559s] that article on June 20th and since then
[3088.52s] we&#39;ve had exactly zero gains first we
[3091.4s] had an immediate 35% drop so that was
[3094.359s] pretty nice call and then um we
[3097.24s] recovered and now we&#39;re back down
[3099.359s] literally negative this is the hottest
[3101.28s] stock that people can&#39;t get get enough
[3103.359s] down at you know wherever it was in the
[3107.079s] 2020 lows you couldn&#39;t give it away now
[3110.04s] everybody wants it and that&#39;s why you&#39;re
[3112.119s] seeing some distribution here the
[3113.68s] question is what will be the magnitude
[3115.72s] of this distribution and I think um you
[3119.76s] know like I said on St a couple weeks
[3121.48s] ago I wouldn&#39;t be a buyer that&#39;s all I
[3123.04s] can tell you uh record inflows for us
[3125.92s] ETFs so again this this theme I I saw it
[3131.119s] felt it heard it over the week uh us
[3134.359s] only don&#39;t touch International you know
[3137.559s] pile into all these stocks that are
[3139.4s] trading at 40 times 100 times sales it&#39;s
[3142.4s] going to be okay they&#39;re going to change
[3144.2s] the world and all day long talking about
[3146.599s] Tams the minute people start talking
[3148.4s] about total addressable markets run the
[3150.2s] hell out of the
[3152.72s] room because it&#39;s just code to sell you
[3155.04s] something that&#39;s trading at 10 20 30 40
[3157.16s] 50 times sales which on average with the
[3160.52s] exception of the Zer environment of the
[3164.16s] 10-year period from you know
[3166.76s] 2019 to
[3169.0s] 2022 uh where you actually made money
[3171.839s] buying stocks trading at 10 times sales
[3173.599s] and making no money uh every other
[3176.119s] decade since 1890 you got decimated
[3180.04s] decimated in the sense that They Carried
[3182.4s] you out in a Stretcher and you never
[3183.96s] came back and you joined the military or
[3186.839s] you went to flipping burgers or driving
[3188.64s] a taxi uh and I think as rates normalize
[3192.72s] the people who are buying 20 30 40 50
[3195.68s] time sales and losing money or making a
[3198.28s] little bit money are going to get
[3200.64s] carried out in a Stretcher so
[3204.24s] um percentile of s it sentiment
[3207.48s] indicators you can see here it&#39;s getting
[3209.96s] frothy and if you look at the things
[3211.599s] that are moving not dissimilar to 2021
[3214.64s] not dis similar to 99 2000 you want to
[3217.599s] avoid those and even if you get a
[3220.079s] pullback in those groups uh and you&#39;re
[3222.48s] buying quality under the surface which
[3224.0s] has been you know right now we are in
[3225.559s] tax loss selling Ser season so from
[3228.0s] December 10th to December 20th you will
[3231.48s] see uh some weakness in the things that
[3233.599s] have been weak before the Santa Claus
[3235.64s] rally and then they&#39;ll start to get bit
[3237.88s] as we turn the calendar um so just be
[3241.24s] cognizant of
[3242.52s] that this is the country composition of
[3246.2s] the msci world index it&#39;s like us is
[3249.319s] like 67% of the index and some I don&#39;t
[3253.319s] know it&#39;s like half of that in terms of
[3255.359s] global GDP China&#39;s 5% and like 16% of
[3258.92s] global GDP so this is this is an extreme
[3261.559s] the rubber band is stretched as far as
[3263.119s] the rubber band can go and it&#39;s going to
[3266.04s] reverse
[3270.44s] back exports from China picked up just
[3273.16s] after the election so people are
[3274.599s] frontloading stuff sentiment around the
[3277.52s] consumer reached the highest level in
[3279.0s] almost 3 years in Q3 earnings calls uh
[3282.799s] second half of December has historically
[3284.4s] been the second strongest period of the
[3287.359s] year so after the tax loss selling is
[3290.119s] done in the next handful of days we
[3292.0s] should see some strength into the end of
[3293.96s] the year this is Mike zardi since 1978
[3297.92s] dividends and reinvested dividends have
[3300.64s] contributed
[3302.319s] 69% of the US Stock markets total return
[3306.079s] helping an $10,000 investment grow o to
[3309.72s] over 1.6 million 69% were dividends and
[3314.24s] reinvested dividends so keep that in
[3316.0s] mind when you got companies like CCI and
[3318.559s] Stanley Black and&amp; Decker and uh some
[3321.64s] you know uh great companies like that
[3324.039s] Disney increasing their dividend by$ 30
[3326.48s] 3% in the last 64 years there were only
[3329.4s] six years where dividend levels declined
[3331.599s] and only one where they fell by more
[3333.119s] than 5% the only time they fell was 2009
[3336.2s] in the early 2000s every other year they
[3338.2s] increased the dividends so when you get
[3339.96s] a chance to buy a great company that is
[3342.68s] down a lot in price and you can lock in
[3344.68s] an aberrational yield of four five 6 7%
[3348.72s] with a dividend grower you wind up with
[3350.96s] these situations like Buffett did with
[3352.799s] cocacola in 1999 I think he gets like
[3356.64s] more dividends per year from his
[3359.68s] Coca-Cola position than his initial
[3361.52s] basis because not only do you lock in a
[3364.319s] great yield but the dividend continues
[3366.88s] to grow and compound over the years and
[3369.96s] that&#39;s where you wind up with these huge
[3371.76s] yields with no taxable capital gains you
[3375.039s] pay dividend income over those years um
[3378.28s] and and uh that&#39;s pretty pretty exciting
[3381.2s] dividends have grown an average of 5.7%
[3383.48s] a year more than uh 2% above the rate of
[3385.92s] inflation
[3387.48s] uh this is
[3388.72s] from Jeff hir over at stock Traders
[3391.359s] Almanac talking about the seasonal
[3393.48s] pattern for small caps uh get strong mid
[3397.28s] December and all the way through March
[3399.72s] so that benefits companies like Cooper
[3401.599s] standard like Goose like uh some of the
[3406.0s] smaller com Comstock resources is off
[3408.559s] the charts that&#39;s almost a double
[3410.0s] already as a matter of fact I had a
[3411.24s] friend emailed me today he said my first
[3414.28s] two doubles from hedge fund tips with
[3416.0s] Tom ha uh so I was excited to hear that
[3419.16s] he had I think his doubles were comto
[3422.88s] and gener if if he didn&#39;t make gener or
[3425.92s] he&#39;s just a couple dollars short with
[3427.559s] gener so that&#39;s exciting uh the second
[3430.96s] theme okay so what else do we have ah
[3433.52s] this is the most important chart in my
[3435.28s] view the backdrop for stock Pickers is
[3438.16s] the best in 25 years with correlation of
[3440.72s] stock performance at alltime lows so
[3443.839s] when did we have this it last you had in
[3449.64s] 201718 after that big draw down from
[3452.119s] 1516 and you rallied straight through uh
[3455.24s] 2020 you also had it in when of course
[3459.559s] uh the 2003 2005 period when small caps
[3463.039s] and international took off and you had
[3465.64s] it in Earnest in 2001 which we&#39;ve
[3468.359s] covered we cover almost every week
[3470.4s] comparing it and and the stage set prior
[3473.68s] to the biggest rally in the shortest
[3475.24s] amount of time
[3476.72s] uh from 2002 to 2007
[3479.72s] for
[3480.79s] [Music]
[3483.68s] um emerging markets and four small
[3488.119s] cap second theme focus is on Trump&#39;s
[3490.559s] pledge to make for an easier regulatory
[3492.52s] backdrop financials manufacturing energy
[3494.48s] are key Focus points they expect
[3496.119s] financials could see the biggest impact
[3497.44s] from deregulatory Stand but also that
[3499.2s] small and midcap stock should outperform
[3500.799s] given their higher domestic us exposure
[3502.559s] especially those exposed to financials
[3504.68s] and Industrials so us exposure you&#39;re
[3507.96s] talking small caps and that should be
[3510.0s] and I think the surprise is going to be
[3511.44s] at last you know four or five months big
[3513.72s] rally and then it kind of cools off for
[3515.48s] a little bit when the honeymoon is over
[3517.96s] and then we see the policies and the
[3519.559s] impact and all that stuff this is the
[3521.4s] long-term price Channel we&#39;ve been
[3523.319s] riding the bottom for many many years
[3525.319s] and now we&#39;re working towards the top
[3526.88s] and that&#39;s how Deutsche Bank gets to
[3529.0s] this 7, 7100 uh Target over the next
[3532.4s] year or so uh we shall see opun
[3537.28s] uh this shows the trough in December
[3539.4s] tends to be the
[3541.2s] 15th before rallying into the end of the
[3544.24s] year so maybe a little more wobble into
[3547.359s] uh Monday Tuesday and then uh start
[3549.96s] Santa starts to come to town after the
[3551.599s] tax loss selling is in the rear viw
[3553.72s] mirror one-year price expectations for
[3556.16s] rent rolling over this is good for
[3557.72s] long-term inflation this argues against
[3560.72s] the Arthur Burns feere that Powell has
[3563.44s] lived with for many years of inflation
[3566.119s] coming back like in the&#39;
[3567.76s] 70s uh here we go Financial
[3571.92s] Outlook much better off and then let&#39;s
[3574.76s] pull up some slomer to see some
[3576.359s] long-term charts from
[3585.64s] RBC Trend in cycle here we
[3589.119s] go okay here&#39;s the S&amp;P a lot of people
[3591.64s] looking at this 6600 Target I guess
[3594.2s] that&#39;s um some fibon f Fibonacci
[3598.319s] extension level then you&#39;ve
[3600.92s] got 7,000 for 261 extension that&#39;s
[3604.599s] probably a year and a half
[3606.2s] off um 50,000 on the
[3610.0s] Dow that&#39;s a
[3612.079s] 26.8 extension they&#39;re talking
[3616.44s] about man there&#39;s a lot of bullishness
[3618.72s] in all this just be careful what you&#39;re
[3621.319s] buying because the beauty is if you buy
[3623.359s] it enough under intrinsic value even if
[3625.599s] the market Market pulls back because
[3627.039s] these High Flyers get smoked uh you
[3629.76s] don&#39;t have to worry about it and if
[3631.119s] you&#39;re running low to no leverage you
[3632.88s] definitely don&#39;t have to worry about it
[3634.28s] and that&#39;s where we&#39; like to play uh
[3636.28s] nasdaq&#39;s looking strong here breaking
[3638.039s] out in the short term uh semiconductors
[3641.2s] keeping an eye on uh intel was up a
[3644.52s] little bit today on the uh they&#39;re going
[3647.559s] to IPO one of the pieces of the business
[3649.96s] so they&#39;re getting into action turning
[3651.68s] it around they just need to announce the
[3653.2s] CEO small cap 600 again just breaking
[3656.599s] out if you look at the next Target on
[3659.52s] that it&#39;s up about 20% and then if you
[3662.4s] go to 268 it&#39;s probably you know 30 40%
[3666.119s] higher uh which would be
[3670.359s] constructive Europe is right here you
[3672.68s] know Europe is easing and easing
[3674.52s] aggressively so I wouldn&#39;t discount
[3676.359s] Europe I think there&#39;s a lot to do xus I
[3678.799s] think Emerging Markets is better bang
[3680.28s] for the buck but there&#39;s going to be
[3682.4s] some opportunity in Europe as they push
[3684.24s] through here um Emerging Markets came
[3686.799s] back to retest you had that big breakout
[3688.72s] in September retest now it&#39;s starting to
[3690.359s] move back up No One Believes it again
[3692.52s] this is when you get the most violent
[3694.16s] upward moves ladies and gentlemen so
[3696.52s] hang on to your seats whether it starts
[3699.0s] before the flip of the calendar or not
[3700.68s] who knows but I think you know after the
[3703.599s] flip of the calendar certainly after
[3704.96s] inauguration I think we&#39;re going to be
[3706.559s] in uh rocket launch here and I&#39;m very
[3708.88s] excited about it because I just love
[3711.799s] that No One Believes anything the things
[3713.44s] they announced this week were so bullish
[3715.119s] and people are just
[3716.599s] like it&#39;s because they bought you know
[3719.2s] when When Baba shot up to 120 in
[3721.839s] September they all bought up and then
[3723.88s] they got smoked out because they didn&#39;t
[3725.76s] believe it and teer went on TV at 117 or
[3728.279s] whatever got everyone in they pulled the
[3730.44s] rug out took it back down below 100 and
[3733.279s] now they&#39;re going to rip it higher no
[3734.92s] one&#39;s going to get in it&#39;s just going to
[3736.279s] keep pushing up pushing up pushing up
[3738.319s] all the sellers are out it&#39;s textbook
[3741.2s] it&#39;s been brutal but it&#39;s textbook and I
[3743.319s] just love it um because we&#39;re going to
[3746.799s] finally benefit in such a big way that
[3750.72s] when all is said and done with the
[3752.72s] ability to lower the basis so
[3754.68s] dramatically I think everyone listening
[3756.799s] to this now is between the low 80s to
[3760.92s] the to the mid 80s uh in terms of Baba
[3764.559s] some of you have kweb and when this
[3766.88s] thing rips uh we are going to Mint so
[3769.279s] much money it&#39;s unbelievable I mean it&#39;s
[3771.319s] just and we all have bigger positions
[3773.48s] than we ever could have imagined
[3774.76s] compliments of xiin ping uh Tokyo Stock
[3778.48s] Exchange no interest
[3780.96s] uh uh Hong
[3783.76s] Kong hangsang index so this is what it
[3786.48s] looks like ladies and gentlemen it is
[3788.16s] what we call lower lows higher higher
[3792.16s] highs and higher lows that is called an
[3794.44s] uptrend doesn&#39;t feel like it everyone&#39;s
[3797.279s] nervous I love it I absolutely love it
[3800.2s] this game is just getting started and we
[3803.359s] are excited so you can see these
[3805.039s] different this is the daily breaking out
[3806.72s] the downtrend Line This is the weekly
[3809.279s] just doing this stair step up right
[3811.44s] before a parabolic move higher uh here&#39;s
[3814.279s] the 10-year yield remember here everyone
[3816.319s] said five we said no this is a counter
[3818.319s] Trend rolling over that&#39;s exactly what
[3820.44s] it&#39;s doing us uh 10-year uh yield
[3823.72s] rolling over dollar little fake out
[3826.559s] above this uh resistance line now
[3828.4s] rolling back over all in line everything
[3831.119s] is per playing out perfectly and the
[3833.039s] temporarily detour is Trump got elected
[3837.0s] surprised the Chinese a little bit and
[3838.64s] they did the exact same Playbook that
[3840.52s] they did in 2016 I don&#39;t know like I&#39;m
[3842.64s] not asking them to read history from
[3844.0s] like a hundred years like it&#39;s amazing
[3846.039s] how short the memory is this is
[3847.2s] literally eight years ago and no one
[3848.559s] remembers they did the exact same thing
[3850.44s] Trump says I&#39;m going to tar off you the
[3851.96s] Chinese said no big deal you want to Tar
[3853.64s] of us 20% we&#39;ll devalue the the Yuan by
[3856.52s] 20% like this is not rocket science and
[3858.96s] then Trump&#39;s like oh wait well then we
[3860.799s] don&#39;t really get any benefit no kidding
[3863.079s] so then you get to the table and you
[3865.24s] come up with the deal and everyone&#39;s

[4046.079s] going to make up the irrs like it&#39;s
[4047.559s] going out of style in
[4049.52s] 2025 um
[4054.0s] constellation
[4058.24s] okay qsr we got uh okay so that&#39;s that
[4063.039s] moving back
[4064.599s] here Shanghai property index starting to
[4067.4s] take off uh what I saw in the headline
[4070.64s] prices down sales up so there&#39;s starting
[4073.0s] to be some activity NASDAQ at the top
[4075.0s] end of the Ring range so it&#39;s either got
[4076.559s] to break out and build here or come back
[4078.76s] down to the bottom uh based on some of
[4080.839s] the valuations and everything else now
[4082.68s] here&#39;s what&#39;s important and this is what
[4084.16s] I&#39;ve been talking about all year profit
[4086.72s] growth estimates by sector you could see
[4088.76s] last year mag 7 started at 50% earnings
[4091.319s] growth now it&#39;s dropped down to 18%
[4094.2s] whereas all these many of these others
[4095.839s] were negative earnings growth uh now
[4098.64s] they are accelerating up to double
[4101.159s] digits and mid teens and Healthcare
[4103.359s] which is the most hated sector right now
[4104.88s] is going to grow 20% next year so uh
[4107.48s] we&#39;ve got Baxter we&#39;ve got uh biotech
[4112.319s] we&#39;ve got
[4113.799s] to Baxter biotech I&#39;m just trying to
[4116.679s] think if we need to add some more
[4119.759s] healthc care uh and we&#39;ll keep an eye on
[4122.52s] that Equity positioning across
[4125.719s] sectors okay materials I think that&#39;s
[4128.0s] the opportunity we&#39;ve got the album
[4129.359s] Arrow there com stock resource
[4131.12s] financials positioning not yet extreme
[4133.56s] I&#39;d like to see this get extreme before
[4134.92s] I really start to get ansy with the K I
[4137.799s] think that&#39;s got a lot more to go but
[4139.319s] I&#39;m I&#39;m keeping an eye on it because
[4140.799s] it&#39;s it&#39;s moved a lot software revisions
[4143.319s] have shown strength
[4145.359s] recently Oppenheimer 7100 Target opinion
[4149.04s] follows
[4150.199s] Trend here&#39;s a Divergence between tips
[4152.719s] 10year yield and forward pees so one of
[4156.12s] these has to come
[4158.159s] down um
[4167.359s] tips yield
[4171.359s] inverted yeah that makes a lot of sense
[4174.12s] uh asset managers are the least bearish
[4175.92s] on the dollar since
[4178.47s] [Music]
[4181.0s] 2017 so I don&#39;t even need to look at the
[4183.48s] chart by the way my goodness ladies and
[4186.279s] gentlemen talk about history books um
[4190.6s] we&#39;ve covered this chart but I don&#39;t
[4192.759s] even need to look at the chart to tell
[4194.36s] you they
[4196.08s] so they&#39;re the most least bearish is in
[4197.96s] other words saying the most bullish
[4199.36s] they&#39;ve been since
[4200.719s] 2017 so let&#39;s take a look at what
[4203.52s] happened in
[4204.679s] 2017 to the US dollar and here we go
[4209.159s] ladies and gentlemen I&#39;m going to pull
[4210.719s] up my little Trump trade chart to show
[4213.48s] you what happened after the inauguration
[4215.719s] and after the election which we&#39;ve
[4217.56s] covered this multiple times but I want
[4220.08s] to reemphasize because the it&#39;s very
[4223.36s] important well okay let me just pull it
[4225.84s] up
[4228.32s] here all right
[4233.76s] USD okay here&#39;s Trump getting elected in
[4237.96s] early November of 2016 what happens the
[4241.679s] dollar rips higher until January right
[4245.4s] before the election and what does it do
[4247.12s] in his first year in office
[4249.0s] 2017 it literally collapses down all the
[4253.6s] way through the end of the year and I
[4256.84s] think we&#39;re going to see a very similar
[4258.76s] situation that no one&#39;s positioned for
[4260.679s] and what happened at the same time while
[4262.44s] the dollar was collapsing in his first
[4264.92s] year emerging markets were rallying as
[4269.48s] well
[4270.56s] as
[4272.6s] China Baba same thing turn of the
[4275.36s] calendar straight up $84 to
[4277.96s] $187 like you guys can&#39;t even like you
[4282.52s] think that is such a foreign concept
[4284.48s] that that could never happen happened in
[4286.04s] 2024 2025 rather because because of
[4289.199s] pessimism and sentiment and all the
[4290.6s] noise we had all the same noise in a
[4293.32s] different box and a different wrapper
[4296.48s] the same different day type of
[4299.639s] negative headlines for one in a half
[4301.719s] straight years in 15 and 16 and then all
[4305.44s] of a sudden straight up okay Baba
[4308.76s] straight
[4309.76s] up
[4314.239s] um emerging markets do I have that chart
[4318.159s] anyway it you know what it does it goes
[4320.12s] straight up watch let me pull that up
[4326.48s] here same thing collapses after he gets
[4329.44s] elected bounces around turn of the
[4331.88s] calendar inauguration merging markets
[4334.84s] doubles in a year so you know ignore
[4338.4s] history at your own Peril listen to all
[4341.08s] the people chasing the shiny objects and
[4344.32s] uh good luck with that
[4345.92s] uh here we go what does financial
[4347.84s] success look like for Americans so if
[4350.56s] you&#39;re
[4351.36s] in uh J if you&#39;re a boomer wow boomers
[4355.48s] are pessimistic they think you only need
[4356.92s] a million bucks if you&#39;re Gen X they
[4358.719s] think you only need five million gen
[4362.04s] z uh you need 10 million bucks or a half
[4365.12s] a million dollars a year salary uh I
[4367.4s] think that&#39;s right and I think for many
[4369.52s] of you in your 20s that are learning how
[4371.08s] to invest properly now if you are
[4373.44s] patient and you are d
[4375.719s] this is going to be a slam dunk for you
[4377.239s] guys I mean this you don&#39;t need to
[4379.199s] invent anything you don&#39;t need to
[4380.52s] predict anything all you need to do is
[4383.44s] invest in yourself do the best you can
[4384.88s] at your career sock away all the money
[4386.8s] compound it and you will be set up
[4389.679s] according to your generation&#39;s
[4391.159s] definition of success uh China PPI
[4394.88s] starting to turn back
[4397.0s] up uh here is the global um easing cycle
[4402.32s] that we talked about here&#39;s the price to
[4404.4s] book on tax so a little bit of
[4406.48s] contradictory stuff but I I think what
[4408.36s] it is is I&#39;m bullish under the surface
[4410.08s] in xus I&#39;m neutral on the things that
[4414.159s] have already run I think they do okay I
[4416.239s] think they underperform and then you
[4418.239s] look at some of these indicators they&#39;re
[4419.52s] not anywhere near extreme so we&#39;re not
[4421.4s] at Euphoria which is like climbing the
[4423.84s] wall of worry pushing that $7 trillion
[4426.239s] money market money back in BuyBacks are
[4429.12s] still going uh cut came down a little
[4431.639s] bit in the last few weeks price of
[4433.44s] diamonds collapsing if there was ever
[4435.239s] time to get married it&#39;s right now
[4436.56s] ladies and gentlemen before the price of
[4438.0s] diamonds goes back
[4439.48s] up although now there are fakes I think
[4442.4s] they&#39;re making these carbon things but
[4445.4s] um all right electric say no thanks to
[4449.4s] fiscal austerity so they voted for
[4451.8s] people who were going to keep the party
[4454.04s] going into the late hours until the last
[4457.76s] call who holds the US debt this is kind
[4459.88s] of interesting everyone&#39;s worried about
[4461.199s] China selling off the debt they own 2%
[4463.92s] of our debt so Federal Reserve owns 15%
[4466.76s] mutual funds own 11% depository
[4469.159s] institutions that got whacked because of
[4471.88s] Powell forced them to buy it all in 2021
[4474.76s] and he pulled out the rug from
[4475.84s] underneath them they all had the mark to
[4480.28s] Market state and local governments 5%
[4483.08s] Pension funds 3% insurance companies 1%
[4486.44s] US savings bonds 177% of us treasuries
[4490.4s] Japan 3% China 2% UK 2% other countries
[4494.52s] 15% % so UK owns as much us treasuries
[4498.84s] as China does that&#39;s mind-boggling when
[4500.719s] you think about it us small business
[4502.8s] optimism has gone parabolic just like it
[4504.8s] did when right after the 2016 election
[4508.159s] guys history doesn&#39;t repeat but it
[4510.6s] Rhymes over and over we have these type
[4513.28s] of things if you just pay attention us
[4515.8s] small business optimism Soares to
[4517.52s] threeyear high after Trump
[4520.44s] win
[4522.56s] um there you go this shows from drick
[4526.44s] Once a bull market gets 2 years old
[4528.719s] there could be a lot left and it shows
[4531.44s] the history and kind of where we are
[4533.679s] right now is this little red line so
[4536.159s] yeah you could get some consolidation
[4538.48s] here but there&#39;s a tendency for these
[4540.639s] things to go I think we&#39;re halfway
[4541.92s] through the secular bull last 18 years
[4544.52s] we broke out in uh
[4548.4s] 2014 we&#39;re 10 years in we probably have
[4550.96s] another 8 years is basically where I&#39;m
[4553.32s] at and if you look at demographics fits
[4555.36s] in pretty nicely one more bit of good
[4557.679s] news November was huge for stocks big
[4559.639s] winner with small caps Russell up 10.9%
[4562.44s] last month lower taxes stronger economy
[4565.08s] 22 other times the Russell gained double
[4567.08s] digits in a month 6 months later it&#39;s
[4568.8s] been a higher 90% of the time a year
[4571.32s] later uh up at 15% on average Brazil&#39;s
[4576.239s] president Lula D Silva recovering after
[4578.08s] emergency brain
[4580.84s] surgery um
[4585.08s] I had no comment on that one all I can
[4588.44s] say is uh keep an eye on his health
[4591.4s] because um could be some interesting
[4594.239s] opportunities coming up in that country
[4596.56s] consensus expects 96% of companies to
[4599.04s] grow EPS year onye by 4q
[4603.28s] 2025 huge earnings breath which means
[4606.239s] the 493 are back in the game they&#39;ve
[4608.88s] been left for dead and they it&#39;s their
[4611.0s] time to shine in the
[4612.96s] sun here is in side are buying we
[4616.56s] covered that this is bearish print
[4618.76s] except for the fact that they&#39;re always
[4621.08s] early by many
[4623.36s] months here is the hangsang index why am
[4628.8s] i showing you the hangsang index in 2003
[4631.92s] compared to
[4633.84s] 2024 because this is the last time you
[4638.719s] saw the shift the China us China to us
[4644.92s] 10-year yield
[4647.159s] spread uh the last time that it got this
[4651.0s] low -200 basis
[4654.36s] points uh was basically
[4658.36s] 2001 and then again in
[4663.76s] 2004 2005 and you can
[4667.28s] see what happened following this period
[4671.159s] where you had this spread in yields you
[4672.92s] had the biggest rally in the shortest
[4674.159s] amount of time
[4675.76s] uh in history so all these things are
[4677.84s] setting up no one&#39;s paying attention to
[4679.639s] it instead they want to buy every stock
[4682.0s] that&#39;s been up you know huge amount
[4684.32s] triple digits they all want to buy it
[4687.639s] now and be the bag holders for the
[4690.08s] people who are buying it in
[4692.44s] 2022 manufacturing headwind set to ease
[4695.159s] with the global monetary
[4697.199s] easing cycle in action now so what you
[4700.159s] can see here is global manufacturing PMI
[4704.159s] has laed agged the percentage of central
[4706.48s] banks easing in easing mode which is now
[4711.96s] uh looks like it&#39;s at
[4717.239s] uh 70% of central banks are in easing
[4721.159s] mode you can see PMI always catches
[4724.56s] up that&#39;s manufacturing here bounced off
[4727.84s] this trend line as we had anticipated
[4729.639s] everyone said five five five we said
[4731.4s] counter Trend bounce and it&#39;s
[4734.04s] rolling back over so now we&#39;re getting a
[4735.6s] bounce people are going to start saying
[4736.92s] five again and they&#39;re going to be wrong
[4738.76s] again um China Golden Dragon index
[4742.52s] breakout back test rolling back up we&#39;re
[4745.0s] going straight up in 2025 in my humble
[4748.159s] opinion this is all opinion not advice
[4751.12s] go to hedge fund tips.com click on
[4754.159s] terms and forward PE ratio again skewed
[4758.76s] high due to those seven stocks
[4765.76s] okay this is interesting
[4769.48s] from Tom Lee over at fun Strat and what
[4772.679s] he&#39;s basically saying is we&#39;re going to
[4775.92s] have more subdued returns in
[4779.159s] 2025 and all the gains are going to be
[4782.04s] front loaded and the second half is
[4784.92s] going to be weak I&#39;m more in line with
[4787.36s] the the front half is going to be more
[4789.36s] subdued and the back half is going to re
[4791.04s] rally so his rationale for that
[4795.44s] is he looked at what I&#39;m looking at is
[4800.679s] the presidential
[4802.8s] cycle uh after the
[4806.719s] inauguration you get the excitement into
[4809.159s] the inauguration you kind of get a
[4810.48s] little consolidation and weakness after
[4812.28s] the the and then the back half of the
[4814.04s] first year is better midterm year is
[4817.52s] worse uh what he&#39;s looking at is just
[4820.4s] randomly picking all years where you had
[4822.6s] two years of 20% plus gains and what the
[4826.56s] pattern looked like and they continued
[4829.56s] the gains into the first half and then
[4831.8s] they got weak the second half
[4837.12s] um you
[4838.88s] know we buy good companies when they&#39;re
[4841.12s] marked down that&#39;s that&#39;s what can I
[4843.719s] tell you uh Mike
[4847.52s] zakari going for three in a row in 2025
[4850.48s] five of the last seven so this is S&amp;P
[4853.44s] rally 20% each year from 1995 to 1999
[4857.56s] why that&#39;s an interesting comparison and
[4859.719s] prior to that was
[4861.52s] uh the mid-40s and the early 50s is
[4865.96s] because we just went through that
[4868.159s] midcycle fed intervention like 1995
[4872.04s] which we&#39;ve been using as an analog for
[4873.52s] so long so you got to be open-minded
[4876.4s] that next year could be better than
[4877.639s] everyone expects but um prepare for the
[4880.159s] wor you know expect for the expect the
[4882.84s] best prepare for the worst is is usually
[4884.719s] good good way to think about it uh
[4886.52s] investment sentiment is euphoric that
[4889.12s] you know that doesn&#39;t always mean
[4890.6s] something coming off these big troughs
[4892.76s] it can continue especially these big
[4894.56s] Cycles you you bounced right up in 2009
[4897.12s] 2010 but you still kept going uh it
[4900.159s] bodess for some consolidation and I&#39;m
[4902.199s] thinking after the inauguration in
[4903.8s] February we&#39;ll get a little weakness uh
[4906.52s] but we&#39;ll we&#39;ll take it as it
[4910.159s] comes uncertainty and mean reversion
[4912.88s] Drive gold speculative l
[4915.88s] uh this is looking like net long managed
[4919.56s] money on the comx is looking like other
[4922.199s] previous Peaks going back through 20
[4925.88s] 2016 you saw
[4929.08s] 2017
[4930.8s] 20120 and now I look here&#39;s the gold
[4934.28s] chart we told you up here that we
[4936.92s] wouldn&#39;t be buyers we&#39;re kind of
[4938.239s] agnostic I don&#39;t know if it corrects but
[4941.199s] um I think they&#39;re better higher and
[4944.56s] better uses 2025 year ahead better first
[4947.679s] half wor second half that&#39;s what uh Tom
[4950.28s] Lee is
[4952.679s] suggesting political party in control
[4955.04s] all red Equity return annual going back
[4958.36s] to 1900 is
[4960.52s] 7.7% annualized Which is less than
[4962.92s] people think so that&#39;s something to keep
[4965.12s] in mind that also speaks to probably xus
[4968.239s] better dollar weak xus equities better
[4971.8s] we will see I think you know why why you
[4974.8s] see these type of things is because you
[4976.0s] see dramatic change setting the platform
[4977.84s] setting the stage for the next phase of
[4979.4s] growth so let&#39;s see what happens there
[4981.56s] tax cut to 15% from 21% is estimated to
[4984.159s] be 4% benefit to the S&amp;P with greatest
[4986.719s] benefit to Consumer discretionary at
[4988.8s] 6.8% communication services at 5.1 you
[4992.4s] know consumer discretionary VF Corp we
[4994.719s] love it here&#39;s Nvidia again no gains
[4996.52s] since that article in June uh structural
[5000.04s] underperformance interrupted by
[5001.76s] multi-year rallies this is the Euro area
[5004.52s] versus the US this is a downward linear
[5006.88s] regression line with plus and minus one
[5010.0s] standard deviation I think that this
[5013.52s] does Bode quite well for Europe versus
[5017.159s] us in coming
[5019.36s] years and um it also look looks to the
[5023.56s] earnings Trend and when you consider
[5025.159s] they&#39;re going to be easing more
[5026.32s] aggressively than we are there&#39;s
[5028.199s] something to be said for that catch-up
[5029.639s] trade selectively where you don&#39;t get
[5031.88s] burned by just taking a basket you pick
[5034.639s] the best value at the lowest price and
[5037.52s] you benefit from these mean reversion
[5040.0s] opportunities it is
[5042.84s] uh Do or Die day here on the
[5045.92s] semiconductor index bouncing up against
[5048.159s] this 5200 day moving average uh this is
[5051.76s] kind of interesting you see these if you
[5053.44s] drive along the Pacific Coast Highway
[5055.0s] blew my mind here in Southern California
[5058.6s] uh they&#39;ve got oil rigs right off the
[5060.28s] coast I mean it&#39;s it&#39;s amazing I&#39;m not
[5062.56s] going to go into giving you a lesson on
[5064.12s] the different kind of rigs but uh it&#39;s
[5066.08s] all here in one thing and it&#39;s pretty
[5067.719s] cool to learn so I would check that out
[5070.48s] and
[5072.4s] um Howard marks the desire for more the
[5075.52s] fear of missing out I literally fear of
[5079.119s] missing out like that
[5082.56s] Jean God missed me when he handed out
[5085.76s] fomo jeans he he did not give me one I
[5088.96s] like I I love seeing people make money
[5092.199s] and I do not care if I&#39;m involved in
[5095.48s] that at the moment because I know if I
[5097.44s] stay in my Lane I have a repeatable
[5099.56s] amazing framework that consistently
[5101.159s] works I sleep well at night my clients
[5103.36s] can sleep well at night and we know over
[5105.119s] time we&#39;re going to get these monster
[5106.92s] Years and we&#39;re going to get years that
[5108.92s] underperform and then we&#39;re going to get
[5110.44s] dramatic outperformance all at once when
[5112.239s] it comes it comes all at once when you
[5113.52s] do this this type of uh framework
[5116.159s] because of the way Mr Market Works in it
[5118.48s] Euphoria and despondency and everything
[5120.96s] else but when you&#39;re buying I mean look
[5123.44s] the best lesson I can give you ladies
[5124.8s] and gentlemen is when you&#39;re buying the
[5125.92s] companies that we&#39;re buying on balance
[5128.84s] over time cash flow and revenues go like
[5134.159s] this and price goes like this around the
[5138.04s] free cash flow intrinsic
[5140.6s] value and what we try to do is we just
[5143.719s] buy when price is down here even though
[5147.0s] cash flow really hasn&#39;t changed and
[5148.639s] revenue really hasn&#39;t changed it&#39;s just
[5150.4s] slowly growing up on Trend over 10 20 30
[5153.199s] 40 years the longer the better for us so
[5155.0s] we can see how it acts through cycles
[5157.04s] and then we get just get Mr Market
[5159.76s] despondency uh for accumulation and Mr
[5162.44s] Market Euphoria for distribution that is
[5165.199s] that&#39;s our model right there it&#39;s not
[5166.639s] rocket science that&#39;s that&#39;s all we do
[5169.119s] so um Howard marks VI are missing out
[5171.639s] the tendency to compare against others
[5173.28s] the influence of the crowd and the dream
[5174.84s] of the sure thing these factors are near
[5177.04s] Universal thus they have a profound
[5179.0s] Collective impact on most investors in
[5181.08s] most markets this is especially true at
[5183.159s] the market extremes the result is
[5184.719s] mistakes frequent widespread recurring
[5187.36s] expensive mistakes and that&#39;s what we
[5189.04s] aim to avoid like Buffett said rule
[5191.52s] number one is don&#39;t lose money rule
[5193.52s] number two don&#39;t forget rule number one
[5195.8s] so you know these highflying silver
[5199.119s] shiny things have their day in the sun
[5201.32s] until they don&#39;t uh and then you know
[5204.199s] these guys just disappear and you know
[5207.44s] you hear from back from some of them 20
[5209.52s] years later and no one reads their bios
[5211.56s] to realize they blew up in the tech
[5213.119s] wreck uh massively and they came back
[5216.239s] but you know the memory is short and
[5218.36s] people just you know they they come back
[5220.119s] they&#39;re like cockroaches they never
[5221.36s] really go away so uh individuals who
[5224.08s] cannot Master their emotions are ill
[5225.92s] suited to profit from the investment
[5227.639s] process that&#39;s Ben Graham clar Seth
[5230.199s] claran typically we make money when we
[5232.04s] buy things we count the profits later
[5233.92s] but we know we have captured them when
[5235.56s] we buy the bargain and finally uh from
[5239.679s] Benjamin Graham a great company is not a
[5242.08s] great investment if you pay too much for
[5245.32s] the stock that is the name of the
[5248.92s] game uh Prof probabilities of a cut next
[5253.119s] week are
[5254.08s] 96% new Traders are betting on a quarter
[5256.8s] point rate cut next week U us CPI brings
[5260.719s] no surprises firming up Fed rate cut
[5262.88s] bets Boeing stock is taking off here is
[5265.52s] why from Al rout over at Boeing uh We&#39;ve
[5268.4s] covered the reasons why over and over
[5270.159s] and now the rest of the market is
[5271.239s] starting to believe us the fate of
[5273.28s] markets rests on Trump&#39;s dollar policy
[5276.679s] it&#39;s going lower ladies and gentlemen
[5278.199s] he&#39;s told you what he&#39;s going to do and
[5279.6s] that&#39;s what&#39;s going to happen China&#39;s
[5281.4s] Yuan likely to stabilize and strengthen
[5283.52s] Central Bank says after they devalued it
[5286.199s] against uh their early salvos with
[5289.639s] negotiating with Trump this is from Ryan
[5291.88s] Dietrich now the Bears are apologizing
[5293.719s] so you had Mike Wilson who got blown out
[5296.0s] and then you had another Perma bear who
[5297.96s] wrote an apology to people I&#39;m sorry
[5299.76s] I&#39;ve been so bearish for the last 3
[5301.239s] years and you missed you know 100 plus
[5303.0s] perc and and uh yada y y and then I see
[5306.239s] the guy in the next day on TV and he&#39;s
[5307.679s] bearish again so you know it&#39;s just it&#39;s
[5310.48s] just genetics ladies and gentlemen uh
[5313.36s] Boeing restarts 737 Max production a
[5315.76s] month after the strike ended so the
[5317.119s] strike&#39;s fixed the max 737 is fixed
[5320.52s] Kelly ortberg&#39;s in the seat what else do
[5322.639s] you want to think about ladies and
[5323.76s] gentlemen and 10year backlog here&#39;s why
[5326.04s] Disney is doubling down on cruises with
[5327.719s] a 12 billion doll spending spree because
[5329.36s] it&#39;s got a high high return on Capital
[5331.92s] much higher than its weighted average
[5333.239s] cost of capital why nothing else to
[5335.52s] think about B boing to lay off hundreds
[5337.48s] in Washington state as companywide Cuts
[5339.159s] continue I think many of those will be
[5340.84s] the people that were striking and uh
[5343.08s] that&#39;s the way it
[5344.32s] goes um but they&#39;re going to take those
[5347.32s] costs out one way or another if everyone
[5348.84s] else wants a bigger raise than the
[5350.88s] market then they will just cut back on
[5352.76s] the people that they need China&#39;s poet
[5355.4s] borrow mentioned these two words for the
[5356.88s] first time in more than a decade stock
[5358.639s] sword and those two
[5362.4s] words uh
[5365.6s] were it was I think loose loose monetary
[5369.119s] policy let&#39;s
[5370.639s] see but met more proactive fiscal
[5373.159s] policies and moderately loose monetary
[5375.719s] policiy which uh moderately
[5379.08s] loose regard to Central Bank policy in
[5383.199s] 2011 so this is a big deal and you can
[5385.8s] go back and see what the stocks did ant
[5387.4s] group gets new CEO as billionaire
[5389.159s] founder Jack M talks up AI in rare
[5391.48s] appearance fact that they own a piece of
[5393.719s] pretty much every AI startup in China
[5395.84s] because they give them compute Power
[5397.32s] Credit in the cloud is something that no
[5399.56s] one else is talking about it&#39;s going to
[5401.56s] be one of the greatest value unleashes
[5403.639s] in the next few years
[5407.119s] um China&#39;s new monetary policy eo&#39;s 2008
[5412.8s] stance we just covered that Chinese
[5416.08s] Premier vows to do everything possible
[5418.32s] to expand demand everything possible to
[5421.08s] expand demand and the Market&#39;s like sh
[5424.88s] what about
[5427.199s] Trump what about Trump he&#39;s going to
[5429.639s] hurt them just like he did in 2017 and
[5432.08s] 18 when they all tripled Americans cars
[5434.639s] keep getting older and creakier that&#39;s
[5437.04s] good news for Advanced Auto Parts that&#39;s
[5439.239s] good news
[5440.4s] for Cooper standard why American why
[5443.639s] investors fear the AI Revolution May
[5446.32s] face a Napster problem here&#39;s a great
[5448.08s] article from Charlie
[5449.679s] gasparino uh you know you can scrape all
[5452.04s] this stuff but at some point you have to
[5453.36s] pay for the content and that&#39;s going to
[5456.0s] slow that down so just keep that all in
[5458.08s] mind Doge plans to cut 500 billion from
[5460.199s] over 1,200 programs just 24 make up the
[5462.6s] most of it that&#39;s deflationary so for
[5465.119s] those of you thinking about deficits
[5466.719s] thinking about uh all that stuff yields
[5470.08s] blowing out think again China has a lot
[5472.679s] of room to raise the fiscal deficit
[5474.8s] jinha said so we&#39;re lowering our deficit
[5477.52s] lowering fiscal spend lowering growth
[5480.639s] they are raising their fiscal deficit
[5483.4s] raising fiscal stimulus raising growth
[5487.08s] and no one&#39;s paying attention Intel adds
[5489.92s] some much needed help to its board with
[5491.639s] stock on track for its worst year ever
[5494.56s] that is what it is but look you know we
[5496.48s] love buying at a tangible book we love
[5498.199s] owning it in the 20s we&#39;ll take a look
[5500.4s] in the 40s after you know after the
[5502.88s] Legacy business is fully valued and then
[5505.92s] um determine what they&#39;re doing with the
[5508.08s] foundaries and what they&#39;re doing with
[5509.639s] AI I think that there&#39;s going to be a
[5511.6s] reason to hold it after it&#39;s in the&#39; 40s
[5513.44s] but we&#39;ll we&#39;ll keep an open mind Disney
[5515.92s] boost dividend 33% after achieving
[5518.679s] streaming profit that was a key part of
[5520.679s] our original thesis when you couldn&#39;t
[5522.28s] give it away in the 70s and
[5524.52s] 80s uh now you know knocking on the door
[5527.679s] of 120 people are starting to pay
[5529.44s] attention is just getting started why
[5531.199s] investors need to watch Japan as a key
[5532.92s] source of Market risk in
[5534.52s] 2025 very short memory ladies and
[5536.639s] gentlemen early August what happened the
[5538.32s] market
[5540.76s] got completely shellacked
[5543.96s] mag 7 in particular as the carry trade
[5547.239s] on wound when Japanese inflation started
[5549.8s] ticking up and the Central Bank started
[5552.04s] hiking rates well they&#39;re going to be
[5554.4s] back to it maybe as soon as this month
[5557.0s] and you can I can tell you very
[5560.44s] simply the higher the Japanese bond
[5563.6s] yield goes the lower mag 7 is going to
[5566.4s] go because when they&#39;re borrowing and
[5568.52s] doing the carry trade it&#39;s all going
[5571.119s] into high-risk us uh it&#39;s play on
[5573.96s] currency it&#39;s a play on free money it&#39;s
[5575.76s] a play on uh speculation and when that
[5579.48s] unwinds it unwinds hard and that&#39;s when
[5581.44s] the 493 become the flight to safety
[5584.32s] that&#39;s when these guys get smoked money
[5586.0s] comes out of Japan money comes out of
[5587.84s] Mag 7 it&#39;s just getting started 10cent
[5591.199s] boss Pony ma Praises China&#39;s Economic
[5593.28s] Policy stimulus for the private sector
[5596.199s] uh I don&#39;t know why these aren&#39;t opening
[5598.119s] here we go muted wholesale inflation
[5600.0s] rate likely gives fed final go- ahead
[5601.639s] for Fed rate cuts uh China&#39;s yield
[5605.44s] discount to treasuries rec covered
[5607.04s] widest since 2002 we know what happened
[5609.44s] after that Swiss National Bank tapes
[5611.76s] leap with 50 basis point interest rate
[5614.08s] cut Amid Amid Frank strength uh going to
[5617.28s] see more and more of that ladies and
[5618.8s] gentlemen Central Bank eing globally
[5621.04s] China sees needs to increase 2025 fiscal
[5625.199s] def deficit cut reserve requirement
[5629.04s] ratio Trump trump send XI xinping an
[5632.76s] unprecedented
[5634.239s] invitation to attend the inauguration
[5638.4s] that is the world&#39;s longest Olive Branch
[5641.08s] I&#39;ve ever seen Trump has options to
[5643.36s] mitigate the rising us budget deficit
[5645.52s] and those options are being led by Vic
[5648.4s] and Elon a wave of AI pessimism is
[5651.6s] coming how to outlast it this is a great
[5653.56s] article from Jenny Johnson talking about
[5655.6s] what we were talking about last week
[5657.119s] this is the Ft about the move from
[5659.719s] training the models where you need all
[5661.239s] the gpus to inference where you know no
[5663.84s] longer need as
[5666.8s] many and then the game changes and then
[5669.88s] like people you know you&#39;ll get a little
[5671.44s] negativity and then the story will shift
[5674.96s] from AI to Quantum Computing and you&#39;ll
[5677.76s] have a new shiny object just like it
[5679.719s] shifted from you know data security and
[5682.84s] then SAS and then it&#39;s just a flavor of
[5685.0s] the week Wall Street always needs
[5686.28s] something to sell so uh you&#39;ll see that
[5688.84s] but this is a trend that will last and
[5690.56s] it&#39;ll just have a ShakeOut and uh she
[5692.719s] explains how it&#39;s likely to play out and
[5695.239s] I think it&#39;s a reasonable assessment how
[5697.44s] Intel Quantum chips could retransform
[5700.159s] silicon based Computing so you had the
[5702.96s] big announcement from Google yesterday
[5705.04s] with their quantum computer and um all
[5708.92s] the amazing things that can do and
[5710.56s] medicine and uh comput computation Etc
[5714.92s] big breakthrough well Intel is at the
[5717.28s] Forefront with chips uh calling them
[5720.719s] quid bits uh and you can read about that
[5723.239s] and no &#39;s paying attention to Intel and
[5725.28s] they&#39;re going to be one of the key
[5726.56s] players in town as that new flavor of
[5729.199s] the week kicks in and Wall Street starts
[5731.36s] pounding the table on Quantum Computing
[5733.44s] and they start to realize oh it&#39;s not
[5734.8s] Nvidia it&#39;s Intel whoops Central
[5737.679s] economic work conference release
[5739.4s] highlights domestic consumption revi

[5763.52s] till price goes up once price goes up
[5765.239s] people start to read this and it starts
[5766.6s] to work China vows bigger fiscal
[5768.28s] spending to boost consumption next year
[5769.92s] while we&#39;re doing what we&#39;re reigning it
[5771.76s] in uh article of the week top 20 25 pick
[5776.0s] stock market so we went through some of
[5779.44s] this um biggest surprises next year USD
[5783.08s] weekend energy stocks underperform
[5785.92s] Emerging Markets outperform retail
[5787.679s] stocks underperform bonds get bid yields
[5790.52s] compress and I would definitely here&#39;s
[5793.159s] where you can listen to that panel with
[5795.719s] m m Schneider and Sam stovel was a great
[5799.08s] panel um uh this is interesting on Intel
[5802.76s] uh a friend of mine emailed me with some
[5804.4s] negative headlines on Intel this week he
[5806.159s] said quote it&#39;s been a long time since
[5808.08s] I&#39;ve seen this kind of coverage on a
[5809.44s] single dog it reminds me a bit of global
[5812.159s] global Crossing or world
[5814.4s] I totally understand his View and I&#39;m
[5815.96s] sure a lot of people out there feel the
[5817.4s] same way here&#39;s what I had to say in
[5818.8s] response which I think some of you will
[5820.32s] find helpful quote I think GE in 2018 is
[5824.159s] a better analogy of a mismanaged hard-
[5826.199s] tokill business that eventually turned
[5827.679s] around under the right management
[5829.199s] Worldcom was a fraud and Global Crossing
[5831.28s] was speculating on the future so here&#39;s
[5834.04s] where uh ge was down
[5838.119s] um 80 something per in 2018 you couldn&#39;t
[5841.88s] give the stock away
[5844.639s] uh and these were the headlines why
[5847.0s] General uh electric plunged 56% in 2018
[5851.48s] the fall of a blue chip this is when
[5853.199s] they got kicked out of the Dow hint wink
[5855.36s] wink just like Intel just did wink wink
[5858.52s] uh by the way what happened next the
[5860.119s] stock was up 8X over the next two
[5862.639s] years uh
[5864.88s] 700% ge warns of Bleak 2019 but promises
[5868.8s] a brighter future GE has tumbled 25% in
[5872.159s] 2018 it&#39;s still too expensive GE looks
[5874.96s] like the most expensive stock in it SE
[5877.08s] in its sector on a free cash flow basis
[5879.08s] argues JP Morgan etc etc so same same
[5884.08s] thing repeated over and over people just
[5886.32s] don&#39;t get it until they do and then
[5889.0s] guess what now it&#39;s up 8X everyone wants
[5891.84s] GE once again but what happened at the
[5894.199s] bottom here they changed CEOs and they
[5896.04s] got a guy named Larry kulp who changed
[5897.88s] changed the business same thing happened
[5899.84s] with VF Corp same thing happened with uh
[5902.52s] Advanced Auto Part
[5904.04s] same thing happened with Boeing same
[5906.119s] thing happened across our portfolio
[5907.92s] every single one and it&#39;s all working
[5909.679s] and the same EXA exact thing is going to
[5911.36s] happen with Intel same thing happened
[5914.0s] with Disney you got Iger back so it just
[5917.239s] repeats over and over you got to be
[5918.88s] along around long enough biotech got to
[5921.159s] be got to be in it to win it that&#39;s
[5922.599s] going to be a big theme in
[5924.599s] 2025 and uh earnings growth here top 30
[5927.639s] stocks last 60 days down 1.69 that&#39;s not
[5930.52s] the deal the deal is deals in drugs
[5932.32s] deregulation Pharma companies record
[5935.44s] cash um they need to get Innovation a
[5938.599s] lot of drugs coming off a patent they&#39;re
[5940.199s] going to have to make it up and that&#39;s
[5941.48s] how they&#39;re going to do it if you look
[5943.04s] at the other ETF which is the equal
[5945.239s] weight xbi which is what we&#39;re in plus
[5948.639s] 138% over the last 60 plus 1.38% top 30
[5953.8s] weights over the last 60 days earnings
[5956.4s] estimates uh have come up and now
[5958.119s] they&#39;re flat 275 up 13 14% next year
[5962.719s] that&#39;s a good thing
[5964.599s] uh data you had a spike in jobless uh in
[5969.159s] continuing claims were up and in initial
[5971.84s] jobless claims so that forces the fed&#39;s
[5974.639s] hand to follow through and the podcast
[5977.239s] is over we&#39;re going to stick around for
[5978.599s] some ask me anything questions a lot of
[5980.28s] you get Great Value so let&#39;s get started
[5983.28s] and
[5987.44s] um okay first question comes from Kyle m
[5993.08s] is is there any indication that a
[5994.599s] December cut will be enough to get money
[5996.159s] market assets back into equities you had
[5998.04s] previously shared analysis that they
[6000.239s] usually Peak within 6 months of the
[6002.08s] First Rate cut but that could be
[6003.4s] expedited if Cuts were heavier now 100
[6006.48s] basis points in 3 months you think CCI
[6008.88s] is well position at these levels with a
[6010.44s] 6.3% yield to benefit from that change
[6013.28s] if and when it occurs any updates on CCI
[6015.4s] in general it&#39;s been a while since we
[6016.639s] covered in depth uh yeah I had it to
[6019.56s] cover in one of my public appearances
[6021.239s] but we ran out of time uh I&#39;m a buyer
[6024.44s] here I love it this all this is is bonds
[6027.239s] sold off after the Trump election uh CCI
[6030.199s] is a buy no question about it you want
[6032.08s] to lock that in as yields compress all
[6034.639s] these interest rate sensitive reats will
[6036.119s] go up and we think it&#39;s one of the
[6037.28s] highest quality ones in the bunch so it
[6039.36s] is a screaming buy for us at these
[6042.08s] levels new money coming in would get
[6044.92s] exposure all day long for that um next
[6059.159s] Robert Evans asks thoughts on
[6062.92s] carparts.com
[6065.159s] stock
[6067.0s] huh car
[6074.239s] parts oh that&#39;s interesting just must be
[6077.679s] a tiny company what is that ticket P RTS
[6095.84s] negative free cash flow stable revenues
[6099.28s] margins
[6101.36s] compressing what does the balance sheet
[6103.599s] look like
[6131.199s] current libraries for balance sheet
[6133.44s] looks
[6141.679s] okay wanted understand why they have a
[6144.04s] consistent negative return on Capital
[6145.88s] why is this such a crappy
[6147.92s] business
[6161.119s] um all right
[6163.08s] 300
[6165.239s] 600 what did they let&#39;s see what they
[6167.52s] did to the share count yeah they&#39;ve
[6170.119s] doubled the share count since 2018 I
[6172.84s] hate that I literally can&#39;t nothing
[6175.52s] angers me more than management that does
[6177.32s] that
[6181.639s] Soh I
[6185.599s] think I think it&#39;s probably going to
[6187.44s] work as a trade to be honest with you uh
[6190.28s] I just hate management that are like
[6191.96s] that so for me it&#39;s probably a pass but
[6195.599s] I think you&#39;re absolutely right as a
[6198.44s] trade and um I got to learn more about
[6201.44s] the business but it&#39;s definitely worth
[6203.36s] digging into but I I would not place a
[6206.4s] long-term substantial bet with any
[6208.36s] management that disrespects equity and
[6210.52s] ownership in that way uh Matt
[6213.8s] Mitchell hope you and your family are
[6215.599s] enjoying the Cali lifestyle was
[6217.159s] wondering if you&#39;ve taken a look at
[6218.76s] Monclair MC I&#39;m guessing it isn&#39;t quite
[6221.4s] beat down enough and overlaps with your
[6223.4s] baba and Goose positions however seems
[6225.52s] like a high quality business training
[6226.639s] and Regional valuation for long-term
[6228.52s] investor uh Sher shance was to acquire
[6230.96s] another luxury clothing brand Stone
[6233.44s] Island thanks for your work as
[6236.679s] always I&#39;ve been on board since the
[6239.04s] Wells Fargo and Exon Mobile days guys go
[6242.56s] look at those charts my God holy cow
[6245.48s] that brings back memories this was in
[6247.719s] the middle of the pandemic when oil went
[6250.719s] negative go back to the tapes we were
[6252.92s] pounding the hell out of Wells Fargo uh
[6255.96s] we didn&#39;t get it down at 18 I think our
[6257.599s] basis was 25 and change we bought some
[6259.92s] at like 23 some at 27 and it was the
[6263.159s] quickest double I mean it was just
[6264.88s] unbelievable and then and this was a
[6267.04s] scary time but I was like guys it it it
[6269.04s] only traded down this below Book value
[6272.119s] uh this low in in the early 90s and in
[6275.0s] 2008 we got to load the boat and then
[6277.199s] the second one that was such an
[6278.56s] incredible Year by the way and then the
[6280.719s] second one was uh Exxon Mobile my God
[6284.119s] buying this thing down at $30 we didn&#39;t
[6286.719s] get the 23s but we got the low 30s and
[6289.88s] this thing just doubled so quickly and
[6291.8s] then we took them off in late
[6293.56s] 2021 when and then like all the people
[6296.239s] that hated energy down
[6298.119s] there um and it just went up they
[6300.52s] couldn&#39;t get enough up here and it&#39;s
[6301.84s] done basically nothing for three years
[6303.56s] every and and for 2022 and 23 everyone&#39;s
[6306.0s] like energy energy and energy none of
[6307.679s] them were here down here and um my
[6310.679s] goodness well thanks for bringing that
[6312.0s] up Matt that was awesome and let&#39;s try
[6314.719s] Monclair
[6320.639s] MC all right
[6340.76s] wow this does look like a pretty good
[6342.96s] business
[6350.98s] [Laughter]
[6356.159s] all right hit me up again when it goes
[6357.56s] to 45 or 40 and we&#39;re probably going to
[6359.92s] be very interested I just think this has
[6362.599s] got to fall a little bit more I&#39;m not
[6364.0s] sure why but um looks like the margins
[6368.52s] are holding
[6369.8s] up let me just take a look here
[6383.32s] yeah this looks like a pretty good
[6384.639s] business my
[6386.239s] friend
[6395.679s] uh
[6398.8s] y balance
[6405.159s] sheet yeah this is pretty nice so far I
[6409.119s] mean this means like it&#39;s worth starting
[6411.4s] to to look at
[6423.04s] yeah I
[6424.28s] mean it&#39;s interesting yeah I like it
[6427.119s] it&#39;s European based so good
[6430.04s] job M
[6433.4s] NC Daniel Hussein next
[6437.76s] tracker NXT
[6448.4s] all right it&#39;s down 50% what do they
[6453.4s] do problem with this is there not going
[6455.52s] to be enough data for me to go back far
[6457.76s] enough and feel comfortable all right so
[6461.36s] this is interesting what the hell do
[6462.96s] these guys do for
[6469.159s] business solar tracker and software
[6471.96s] solutions for util utility scaled solar
[6474.88s] o this is interesting cuz like I keep
[6477.04s] looking at green stuff which did a lot
[6480.599s] better under Trump than it did under
[6483.92s] Biden and I&#39;ve been looking for one if
[6486.36s] you can show me a decent balance sheet
[6488.32s] you got my attention my
[6491.0s] man
[6492.28s] [Music]
[6495.4s] and yeah I&#39;m getting interested
[6516.679s] lot of air dilution I&#39;m not loving this
[6519.599s] uh at all so I just want to understand
[6521.599s] that I like this I&#39;m going to take a
[6524.0s] look at
[6525.32s] it I think it&#39;s interesting I&#39;ll
[6528.32s] probably do nothing with it but nice
[6530.4s] work Daniel
[6533.159s] Lucas
[6534.679s] Mueller recently had a look at Samsung
[6539.8s] SDI quite interesting situation where
[6542.32s] China dominates 50% of the market supply
[6544.04s] for battery Samsung SDI and some other
[6545.679s] Korean players seem to be the only
[6547.76s] insurance for the West if China becomes
[6549.599s] a warmonger blah blah blah nicely down
[6552.52s] fundamentals don&#39;t look that
[6554.4s] horrible government subsidy train in
[6556.96s] dependence from China care to have a
[6558.679s] look
[6568.08s] all right so we&#39;re not going to pull it
[6569.36s] up
[6580.88s] there Samsung
[6588.04s] SDI
[6590.48s] oh I mean this thing is just burning
[6593.199s] cash like it&#39;s going out of
[6595.32s] style
[6597.76s] uh yeah probably pass on this
[6601.56s] one honestly if you want to look at
[6603.599s] South Korea look at coupang I keep
[6605.199s] looking at it and doing nothing the
[6607.48s] Amazon of uh I got enough Amazon of I
[6610.36s] got Amazon of China I don&#39;t need Amazon
[6612.4s] of Korea but if I didn&#39;t have Amazon
[6614.76s] China I would be looking at um Amazon of
[6618.28s] Korea which is coupang but it&#39;s a little
[6620.88s] rich but it&#39;s also interesting so for
[6623.119s] this I&#39;m going to pass but uh good
[6628.52s] luck there we go we got that back all
[6631.56s] right uh Toma Fisher thoughts on Match
[6634.96s] group we&#39;ve covered this a million times
[6637.119s] the revenues aren&#39;t growing it&#39;s
[6639.76s] okay um I don&#39;t know how young people
[6643.36s] date anymore I think this thing is kind
[6645.239s] of tired and dead I could be wrong I
[6648.239s] think they do Tinder or Hive or
[6650.4s] something look it&#39;s generating a ton of
[6652.4s] cash
[6654.639s] this is okay this is must be why I keep
[6656.679s] looking at it so why the hell is Barry
[6660.199s] Diller not doing anything with this like
[6662.32s] he&#39;s asleep at the wheel he&#39;s just not
[6664.28s] doing anything he&#39;s checked
[6666.32s] out after building an incredible
[6668.679s] business the guy just took a
[6675.04s] nap
[6678.56s] um I got to learn this business because
[6682.32s] I keep seeing what you&#39;re seeing and I
[6684.119s] want to get involved and then I look at
[6685.719s] the business and I don&#39;t get involved
[6707.56s] so
[6710.96s] um yeah all I can say about this is you
[6714.159s] got to get on like eight conference
[6715.599s] calls start to listen to what have they
[6717.88s] promised they would do to turn it around
[6720.079s] and what have they actually delivered on
[6723.36s] and why can&#39;t this thing is there some
[6725.679s] seller like I
[6727.28s] mean this thing looks great I mean this
[6729.84s] thing looks like a China stock the
[6731.159s] fundamentals are doing great and the
[6732.76s] stock won&#39;t go up to save its life so
[6736.4s] help me understand
[6741.199s] why all right so they had a lot of share
[6743.52s] issue in I&#39;m not thrilled about that but
[6745.4s] now they&#39;ve reversed it so that&#39;s good
[6747.8s] it might be ready I mean cash flow is
[6750.52s] hanging in there they&#39;re bringing the
[6751.52s] share c c count back down after being
[6754.52s] pigs and
[6757.48s] um I&#39;m going to look at it like a 50th
[6760.52s] time and maybe actually do something so
[6762.599s] good job on that Toma uh JT
[6766.76s] investor Tom your media presence seems
[6768.92s] to have grown significantly over the
[6770.159s] last few years and your presentation

[6773.0s] you very much can you share some
[6774.36s] insights on how you refine your
[6775.44s] presentation skills things you do to
[6776.76s] prepare for presentations and any other
[6778.28s] tips lessons learned over the years as
[6780.079s] you clear your master your pictures have
[6781.32s] great ability to convey excitement
[6782.56s] conviction that is genuine and creates
[6784.04s] positive engagement with your audience

[6791.84s] you very grateful for that commentary uh
[6794.32s] two I just you know if you love what you
[6796.76s] do it comes through this is what I love
[6799.36s] to do okay I love family I love doing
[6802.679s] this and I love playing golf I haven&#39;t
[6804.4s] played much golf lately but I did just
[6806.04s] join the local Club so markets close at
[6808.679s] 1: p.m. out here which is pretty awesome
[6811.639s] um so I&#39;ll uh I&#39;ll get that going and I
[6814.36s] got to get my goal by the way um you
[6818.079s] know going here to get to a single-
[6821.599s] digit handicap I don&#39;t think I&#39;m going
[6823.28s] to get it done before the end of the
[6824.52s] year but um moving in the right
[6827.48s] direction it&#39;s amazing there&#39;s this Golf
[6829.159s] Tech one block away from my apartment in
[6830.8s] New York city so I take lessons when I&#39;m
[6832.56s] in the city 10 days a month and then I
[6835.48s] uh and then I can play out here all year
[6837.56s] round so so I&#39;ll get there what does
[6840.159s] that have to do with your question
[6842.44s] um I don&#39;t think there&#39;s anything you
[6844.639s] can do other than love what you do and
[6846.92s] do it 247 so you&#39;re not you&#39;re preparing
[6850.719s] yeah but your preparation is just what
[6853.04s] you do in the normal course of business
[6854.56s] every single day like I mean look at my
[6856.8s] daily reads if if all you did was read
[6858.639s] my daily reads every day for a year you
[6860.32s] would know more than 90% of the people
[6861.8s] in the market
[6863.32s] um and that takes a long time so you
[6866.119s] know that&#39;s two three hours every single
[6868.079s] morning uh make it look easy uh
[6870.92s] sometimes I&#39;m doing that from an airport
[6872.28s] lounge sometimes I&#39;m doing it the night
[6874.04s] before because I got to be up at 5:00 in
[6875.719s] the morning or 4:30 now now I&#39;m up every
[6878.0s] morning at 4:30 because I&#39;m on the east
[6879.719s] on the west coast but
[6882.76s] um you know they have clubs called uh
[6885.679s] Toast Masters I guess that could help
[6887.44s] you with public speaking if you&#39;re not a
[6889.04s] good public speaker uh I went for like
[6892.48s] two classes one time when I was young I
[6894.52s] found it boring and I never went back so
[6897.28s] I just I just love what I do I mean if
[6899.56s] you ask me to speak about nuclear
[6901.36s] physics and like you know read a book
[6903.44s] and give a presentation on it I wouldn&#39;t
[6904.96s] be a good presenter because I&#39;m not
[6906.28s] interested so uh just find something
[6909.04s] that you love and it will come through
[6910.76s] and you&#39;ll attract a a group of people
[6913.079s] like-minded people and live a happy life
[6916.239s] uh David big fan of your show from the
[6919.0s] UK could you please have a look at OCTA
[6921.52s] thanks and happy Christmas Christmas
[6923.0s] Happy Christmas to you
[6927.639s] Oka yeah you know a lot of these Co
[6930.28s] Darlings that have crashed are now
[6931.56s] getting interested like PayPal which you
[6934.48s] know it&#39;s it&#39;s moving and grooving no
[6936.92s] one&#39;s paying attention OCTA might be
[6938.56s] another one I have to understand that
[6940.199s] business but I I&#39;ve been looking at it
[6943.159s] and we&#39;ll probably do nothing but I
[6944.8s] think that one&#39;s going to probably
[6949.84s] work let me just confirm that with the
[6953.44s] numbers
[6955.0s] yeah yeah I got I got to figure this one
[6957.88s] out you know the key is it&#39;s like what
[6960.04s] are you going to sell what are you going
[6961.119s] to replace it with so there are just
[6962.92s] huge
[6964.44s] opportunities identity partner in the US
[6968.36s] manage secure identities such as single
[6970.599s] sign on access applications in the cloud
[6973.48s] da d da all right so I just want to
[6975.88s] understand how they can&#39;t get disrupted
[6977.44s] and if I can get to that with these
[6979.199s] numbers I&#39;m in but um that that&#39;s where
[6982.639s] the work begins and I think
[6987.04s] that let&#39;s just take a look here sure
[6990.04s] the balance sheet is
[6997.28s] great yes let&#39;s talk about cash
[7006.84s] flow
[7010.48s] great why does it have such
[7013.239s] low return on invested Capital over time
[7016.04s] I want to understand
[7019.44s] that this is definitely worth a look so
[7023.599s] I probably not going to do anything with
[7025.76s] it but I think you&#39;re on the right track
[7029.28s] David Max
[7032.199s] Moore
[7033.92s] asml I like
[7035.8s] monopolies
[7037.8s] um yeah they&#39;re hit on China and all
[7041.239s] this stuff and us and blah blah
[7043.92s] blah uh I&#39;d like to see it come down
[7047.239s] more I keep looking at this it&#39;s on my
[7049.36s] watch list
[7053.599s] but I&#39;m probably going to miss it if
[7055.88s] this I should put like a alarm at 600
[7059.4s] and if it gets to 600 really do some
[7061.079s] work on it and get involved but uh not
[7064.76s] yet for
[7066.48s] me Kyle Johnson thanks for all the value
[7069.239s] you provide you&#39;re welcome I came across
[7072.48s] the company Janice International Group
[7074.32s] their businesses all around instilling
[7075.719s] maintaining storage unit doors and other
[7081.04s] systems rise run commercial real estate
[7085.159s] expectations lower interest rates caus
[7087.04s] the stock to drop
[7088.36s] 50% IPO 3 years
[7092.36s] old all right Janice International let&#39;s
[7095.199s] take a look I thought you were going to
[7097.04s] talk about the asset manager but that&#39;s
[7100.239s] Janice Henderson
[7107.52s] jbi man we got some smart people tuning
[7110.4s] into this every week I&#39;m super excited
[7112.92s] you guys are learning and earning and
[7116.599s] contributing and sharing with your
[7118.599s] friends and family to grow the thing so
[7120.719s] cash flows down stocks down a lot
[7123.76s] more um
[7136.56s] yeah so it was a growth story now it&#39;s
[7139.52s] not what are they doing to
[7144.639s] equity they&#39;re deluding the hell out of
[7147.159s] people probably for an acquisition or
[7149.159s] something
[7150.84s] else
[7156.48s] um nice cast from
[7160.44s] operations free cash flow okay balance
[7168.159s] sheet balance Sheet&#39;s a little bit
[7174.599s] levered yeah I I think you just got to
[7176.92s] get comfortable with um how are they
[7179.04s] going to re accelerate earnings Kyler
[7181.04s] and what the competitive landscape is
[7182.8s] like do some Channel checks find out who
[7184.88s] they compete with talk to their
[7189.239s] competitors and you&#39;ll learn a lot about
[7191.32s] them but I think I think that&#39;s worth a
[7193.079s] look it&#39;s worth doing some work
[7196.44s] on Eric Haney thoughts on tax loss
[7199.599s] harvesting Baba into something like kweb
[7202.159s] started buy Baba uh nothing on margin uh
[7206.8s] I&#39;d hold out I I I
[7209.119s] seriously I think there are too many
[7211.0s] outs
[7212.28s] for for me it&#39;s
[7215.8s] uh it&#39;s an absolute no-brainer so I I
[7219.679s] wouldn&#39;t want to do that personally
[7224.84s] so you could do it I just don&#39;t think K
[7227.44s] web&#39;s going to do as well as Alibaba and
[7229.44s] that should be the case it&#39;s not because
[7231.32s] there&#39;s anything good or bad about kweb
[7232.76s] I think K web&#39;s fantastic and I think
[7234.4s] it&#39;s a diversified way if you haven&#39;t
[7235.88s] done the work on Alibaba to have the
[7237.32s] same level conviction that I have you
[7239.0s] should own K web instead so that might
[7240.679s] be the right trade for you depends what
[7242.8s] your tax losses are if you&#39;ve averaged
[7244.719s] down you know you&#39;d have to do a first
[7247.599s] in last out type of thing but um if
[7251.04s] you&#39;ve been paying attention you
[7252.119s] probably have a basis in the 880s in
[7254.119s] which case then you should be just
[7256.44s] sitting tight and waiting to make a lot
[7258.76s] of money in our
[7260.48s] opinion uh toen G thank you for all you
[7264.28s] do longtime listener can you please take
[7265.8s] a look at rprx royalty
[7272.04s] Pharma pipelines worth over a billion
[7275.079s] buying back
[7276.679s] shares yeah these are special
[7279.199s] situations um and yes I know you&#39;ve been
[7282.44s] listening for a long time I appreciate
[7284.48s] that and I appreciate your support to
[7286.92s] him uh
[7297.719s] rprx I don&#39;t love these I really I don&#39;t
[7301.48s] love these royalty
[7310.199s] plays I&#39;ve seen too many through the
[7312.48s] years I
[7320.44s] mean yeah I get what you&#39;re talking
[7322.679s] about
[7329.52s] geez yeah it&#39;s just the market never
[7333.04s] gives them their full intrinsic value
[7335.76s] there&#39;s always an overhang that&#39;s what
[7337.8s] that&#39;s what bothers me about this but
[7347.56s] she reminds me of vector Group which was
[7349.52s] a stub on uh cigarette
[7355.119s] companies made a ton of
[7359.28s] money but the same guy also got bagged
[7361.76s] in Borders
[7363.159s] Books
[7365.48s] um there yeah share count okay
[7382.0s] six billion of debt on a royalty
[7383.96s] business 600 million of
[7390.8s] cash two
[7394.119s] billion gosh almighty
[7421.48s] yeah I get it I get it you just have to
[7424.44s] understand all the individual royalties
[7426.4s] which is going to take a lot of work but
[7428.52s] um certainly on the right track to him I
[7431.4s] think worth of

[7554.04s] okay Polytech
[7561.079s] holding Plastic Solutions for passenger
[7563.48s] cars and commercial lightweight
[7566.8s] Vehicles separators
[7571.92s] huh financial analysis
[7583.92s] low quality business over time let&#39;s see
[7586.079s] what&#39;s happening with free cash
[7591.28s] flow okay balance
[7602.04s] sheet share count
[7622.48s] I would say that if I didn&#39;t own Cooper
[7626.84s] standard I would look at it more
[7631.559s] carefully yeah same thing peak in 2027 I
[7634.639s] mean it&#39;s basically the same as Cooper
[7636.04s] standard I just like and Trust Cooper
[7637.719s] standard management more I know them and
[7641.4s] uh but this is definitely interesting
[7642.92s] for sure there&#39;s a ton in the auto space
[7644.719s] that I keep looking at that um have
[7648.28s] tremend all right TJ vandermeir hi Tom
[7651.44s] what&#39;s your opinion on GN store Nord
[7654.88s] Danish company special hearing aids and
[7657.199s] audio devices Revenue
[7660.52s] decline uh market leader turn around
[7664.04s] plan and place low
[7665.639s] price all right let&#39;s
[7668.159s] see GN
[7681.96s] okay
[7685.36s] H
[7686.88s] man this is probably the best AMA we&#39;ve
[7689.4s] ever
[7690.36s] had in five plus years that is pretty
[7693.599s] amazing
[7726.679s] little bit of dilution I don&#39;t like but
[7728.88s] other than that looks like a really
[7730.52s] solid business I&#39;m interested good work
[7733.44s] uh now you got to just understand what
[7734.88s] the competition is why the revenues are
[7737.32s] declining and what&#39;s happening with
[7739.4s] share but
[7742.76s] uh all right here&#39;s another K1 GTX I&#39;m
[7745.719s] sure it&#39;s probably also
[7747.92s] good Garrett motion
[7780.8s] flat revenues what&#39;s happening
[7785.96s] to what is going on with the share count
[7788.679s] this is weird these numbers are probably
[7790.96s] wrong
[7801.92s] yeah so they&#39;ve got solvency risk $1.5
[7805.48s] billion of debt $96 million of cash so
[7808.44s] that&#39;s what you got to get comfortable
[7809.679s] with is the maturities and the business
[7811.52s] and the competition but I think there
[7815.199s] are ways for it to get solved but uh
[7817.52s] it&#39;s not a guarantee Linda Nickerson
[7820.559s] wondering about the last video about
[7822.0s] Emerging Markets which stocks would he
[7823.76s] recommend uh we only own um Alibaba
[7828.0s] directly and then some indirect plays
[7830.239s] like Estee louder and a tiny position in
[7832.76s] Goose uh longtime Watcher your show like
[7835.44s] to pitch Swatch group watchmaker Harry
[7838.4s] Winston Omega blah blah blah SE Master
[7842.32s] no debt blah blah blah market
[7846.119s] cap uh Hayek family
[7854.0s] I bought another 35 million all right
[7857.36s] well interesting s SW a t c
[7873.88s] h negative free cash flow so yeah look
[7878.199s] they&#39;re just turning negative free cash
[7879.76s] flow you have to understand the turn
[7881.48s] around plan I don&#39;t think there&#39;s a lot
[7882.88s] more to talk about here right now it&#39;s a
[7884.52s] no touch until I can understand the
[7886.32s] turnaround plan but definitely keep it
[7888.92s] on the radar Jimmy Jones could you
[7891.92s] explain decide of a stock is dead money
[7893.8s] or an opportunity cost even if
[7895.36s] fundamentals are still the same when you
[7896.679s] move on that situation we&#39;ve covered
[7898.199s] this in the past we apply the same
[7900.0s] framework some go super fast some go
[7902.559s] super slow but they all work when you
[7904.199s] buy good quality businesses below
[7905.88s] intrinsic value and you take solvency
[7908.28s] risk you rule out solvency risk off the
[7910.079s] table good things happen when you buy
[7911.639s] quality assets when they&#39;re on sale I
[7913.44s] don&#39;t that dead money that&#39;s
[7915.36s] that&#39;s just Trader because
[7917.599s] they&#39;re impatient and the stock market
[7919.8s] is a device for transferring money from
[7922.0s] the impatient to the patient I prefer to
[7924.84s] be part of the latter and not the former
[7927.559s] the transfere rather than the
[7930.28s] transferer and uh people who talk in
[7932.92s] these terms are always the transfer s
[7936.84s] versus the transfer EAS of the wealth
[7939.52s] because they are impatient and they fall
[7941.44s] into that it&#39;s a trap it&#39;s this and that
[7944.04s] but if you apply a good framework across
[7945.96s] 10 8 10 12 great companies uh you&#39;re
[7948.8s] going to do great over time and don&#39;t
[7950.639s] get faked out by the shiny object and
[7952.96s] the people who think it have has to go
[7954.599s] super fast um and you&#39;ll be fine any
[7957.599s] advice uh worth investing ran
[7964.159s] pack p
[7980.04s] turning cash flow positive what do these
[7982.52s] guys
[7984.04s] do you know there are a lot of these
[7986.36s] covid companies product Solutions and
[7989.48s] Aline solutions for
[7991.04s] e-commerce packaging Solutions blah blah
[7994.32s] blah h
[8002.119s] yeah looks like it&#39;s trying to recover
[8003.679s] here how&#39;s the business
[8011.719s] doing
[8013.679s] revenues are starting to recover it
[8016.199s] seems
[8023.04s] like management is a tad piggy with
[8026.0s] Equity don&#39;t like me no
[8029.719s] like uh uh kind of lower quality
[8032.48s] business over
[8035.92s] time cash
[8038.52s] versus debt little bit little bit
[8041.8s] levered here this is what you got to
[8043.679s] worry about and keep your eye
[8046.04s] on
[8049.639s] um yeah that&#39;s that&#39;s that&#39;s going to be
[8052.079s] your big thing if you can get
[8053.239s] comfortable with solvency risk your
[8055.119s] recover is probably okay so not bad
[8058.0s] there
[8062.92s] manique and let&#39;s see
[8065.88s] here and then
[8068.76s] finally Landon H looking at bear as a
[8073.52s] long completed partially setle up
[8075.8s] Roundup lination still has some
[8077.4s] settlement items outstanding a lot of
[8081.0s] Deb uh once Market Clarity on the
[8083.599s] remaining
[8084.48s] litigation pay down after debt how would
[8087.079s] you evaluate this stock I wouldn&#39;t we&#39;ve
[8089.119s] looked at it a million times on the
[8091.4s] podcast and we&#39;ve always
[8093.639s] passed
[8099.599s] um I don&#39;t really like this
[8106.079s] one I had confidence in 3M which is why
[8110.079s] that was that worked
[8112.079s] great um but we also didn&#39;t stay too
[8115.44s] long at the table because if you
[8118.119s] remember we had this Spike up
[8122.559s] and now it&#39;s back down so you know it we
[8126.199s] got out and then it shot up to 140
[8128.96s] Beyond us now it&#39;s all the way back down
[8130.28s] to 129 I think this one will actually be
[8132.8s] okay but like it was such a large move
[8134.719s] in a short period of time and you still
[8136.199s] had some uncertainty and you know every
[8138.559s] now and then you got to book profits so
[8141.88s] um let&#39;s take a look here B A ye e r why
[8147.239s] is it not giving me the
[8151.52s] correct
[8165.159s] one yeah I just I just don&#39;t
[8168.559s] have look I think you&#39;re going to be
[8170.559s] right but you&#39;re basically playing
[8172.04s] roulette black and
[8174.4s] red is the litigation over or isn&#39;t the
[8177.119s] litigation over uh and I I really don&#39;t
[8180.52s] want to play play that game I could play
[8182.04s] it with 3m because I understood the rest
[8184.96s] of the business and I understood I could
[8186.96s] quantify and I had an estimate range
[8189.239s] this one I don&#39;t know I think it&#39;ll
[8191.079s] probably it&#39;s probably worth a gamble
[8192.599s] you put 1% you know 1% of your portfolio
[8195.679s] maybe you have a two 3x 4X but um I
[8200.479s] don&#39;t think you can have any Edge on it
[8202.28s] and uh for that reason I&#39;m out uh with
[8205.28s] that said want to thank everyone for
[8206.639s] tuning in we&#39;ll be back next week same
[8208.92s] time same place we&#39;ll be in New York the
[8211.12s] first three days of the week for some in
[8213.399s] studio stuff we&#39;re on Varney tomorrow
[8215.24s] morning early remote and uh in the
[8218.319s] meantime make it a great one bye for now
