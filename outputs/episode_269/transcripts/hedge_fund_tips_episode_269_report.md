## Macro Thesis & Key Data Points

He also highlights the global easing cycle and favorable demographics as tailwinds for the market. He expects a pullback after the inauguration, which will present buying opportunities.

| Indicator | Value | Tom's Interpretation |
|-----------|-------|----------------------|
| US Small Business Optimism | Soared to a three-year high after Trump win | History doesn't repeat, but it rhymes. This is similar to what happened after the 2016 election. |
| China's Potential Fiscal Deficit | China has a lot of room to raise the fiscal deficit | While the US is reigning in spending, China is raising its fiscal deficit, raising fiscal stimulus, and raising growth. |
| Asset Managers Bearish on the Dollar | Asset managers are the least bearish on the dollar since 2017 | This is a contrarian indicator. The dollar is likely to weaken, benefiting Emerging Markets. |
| Correlation of Stock Performance | At all-time lows | The backdrop for stock pickers is the best in 25 years. |
| Global Manufacturing PMI | Lagging the percentage of central banks easing | PMI always catches up. |
| US Beige Book Activity Index | Turning back up | Says economy stable, companies more optimistic about 2025, but tariffs a worry. |
| Cox Automotive Incentives | Booming, at 8% of sales price | Number one key indicator of future volumes is incentives. |
