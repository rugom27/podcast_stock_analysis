MISCELLANEOUS\nThis Is Us walking to the beach and having lunch pretty awesome stuff there uh this is Jeff Adams with me at the money show Symposium Jeff&#39;s a student at FSU doing a lot of admin work for me some Junior analyst work for me put the slideshow presentation together did some right up so he&#39;s just doing an incredible job uh great job there Jeff and actually videotaped the whole thing for us as well that was a dinner with Scott Walker down in Sarasota compliments of Kim gitler and Co at the money show very grateful for that that&#39;s on Pacific Coast Highway not far from our house and uh pretty exciting stuff on that front these are the pictures I left out last weekend and um\n\n### MISCELLANEOUS\nfinally\n\n### MEDIA_APPEARANCE_RECAP\nladies and gentlemen had the pleasure to join Cheryl Kone on the claiming countdown Fox Business this week on Tuesday want to thank Catherine Myers Jake Max to Oppenheimer Brook hak who produced this segment and Liz Clayman for having me on we&#39;re going to listen in here you know and one of the things that you talk about in your research is fiscal and policy wild cards and Tom I want to take that to you because looking ahead to 2025 uh you know you&#39;re saying these are possible surprises the US dollar could weaken after the inauguration and that energy stocks could underperform which I think is interesting and I want to point this out to you uh wolf research put out a note this morning they say that the Trump trade is already running out of steam they say uncertainty in the first half puts a damper on that trade uh so in the meantime they&#39;re focused on the mag 7 how do you respond to that well thanks Sherl I think to tag on what Dutch was talking about his long duration trades I think the biggest surprise of 2025 is going to be that the 10-year treasury gets bid yields compressed what we saw in 2016 after the election treasuries sold off yields went up after the inauguration of trump bonds got bid yields compressed and that&#39;s going to help Dutch&#39;s long long duration trades but we like simpler stocks we like Boeing is a headline today that one&#39;s still down 60% and you can&#39;t give it away but guess what Kelly ortberg is fixing the ship he&#39;s got the union problem solved he&#39;s got the 737 back on the line he&#39;s got a half a trillion dollar backlog over the next 10 years so I think it&#39;s going to surprise surpris people that Boeing continues to climb higher but the work the concern about Boeing though is that about I think it&#39;s correct me if I&#39;m wrong about 60% of the revenue the payment for each plane doesn&#39;t come into the company until they actually deliver the aircraft so that all of this delay has been one of the issues that that hit the stock during the strike you&#39;re not concerned about this backlog they&#39;ve taken out a tremendous amount of cost Cheryl the backlog is solid China is going to double its Fleet by 2043 oh and by the way you can only get planes from two vendors one&#39;s called Boeing one&#39;s called Airbus the stocks down 60% this is one you can tuck away you can sleep well at night and by the way Kelly ortberg is a turnaround specialist at Rockwell Collins in just six years he quadrupled the shareholders money before he sold the company so I think he&#39;s going to do a tremendous job turning things around he&#39;s on the floor in Seattle engineer not a salesperson we&#39;re going to see good things from Boeing in the next two years you can see from the chart Tom that the stock is in recovery mode as to be expected after that strike anded in Dutch I want to go back to you again talk about that fiscal policy question mark As we are now you know whatever 40 days away from from inauguration day um you know you&#39;re talking about those fiscal and policy wild cards Dutch you know I do want to get your take on you know on on federal deficits and stimulus uh because you know Biden is throwing out more student debt payments uh he he made that announcement today so there&#39;s more fiscal SS going in more cost to taxpayers on the other side you&#39;ve got Elon Musk and B ramaswami and they&#39;re focused on $2 trillion in Cuts uh and getting the fiscal House in Washington uh in order uh how do you play that though as an investor as we wait I would say that you know you got to get long this Market okay the Trump trade running out of steam that&#39;s total gar it hasn&#39;t even started yet look at this dream team that he&#39;s put together what happens if we cut government spending rates come down and he&#39;s able to lower the tax rates for individuals to next to nothing this economy we the United States will become the most dominant player like ever on the planet that we&#39;ve ever seen if they just let them do this people will invest money in the markets they will invest in people they will grow their inventories they will grow their businesses again we&#39;re just getting started all right well we shall see I mean certainly there&#39;s a lot of excitement around in particular uh in my mind especially with with dealing with nearly $ 36 trillion dollars in debt that this nation is sitting on can we write the ship and Dutch you&#39;re saying that we can and that would be great for the markets obviously uh Dutch Masters Thomas Hayes guys thank you so much it&#39;s great to see you both today appreciate your time um and we&#39;re back and there we go ladies and gentlemen Boeing is taking off pun intended we&#39;ve been pounding the table loading the boat that&#39;s one of our largest positions just beginning and I explained why then we had the money show appearance in Sarasota this was really incredible this was with Kim uh want to thank Kim gitler Debbie Osborne Mike Larson and Aaron West for having me we&#39;re going to play this 30 second segment nowas investment ideas um it doesn&#39;t you know a lot of people will talk about their picks but his research really goes in depth really tells you the why uh you know what catalysts are for the turnarounds that he identifies and so on so I think you&#39;re going to enjoy his presentation again hedge fund tips with Tom Hayes You&#39;ve seen him on Fox Business uh you&#39;ve seen him on podcast not just my own but his uh he&#39;s specialized again in those finding those undervalued names uh that have a catalyst or multiple catalysts that you know can help with the revaluation really sort of the the Warren Buffett approach to buying undervalued companies so please give a very warm welcome to Tom Hayes of great G so good morning everyone good morning okay has everyone had a great week here a lot of value yeah really want to give a hand to Mike to Debbie to Kim to Aaron all the people that put this together because without them this wouldn&#39;t happen so let&#39;s give them a h so Brian bsky talked a little bit about Jesus when he opened and uh a lot of people when they look to make the right decision they say what would Jesus do I on the other hand When I Look to make the right decision I say what would Warren Buffett do and that&#39;s my framework hands up who thinks Warren Buffett is the greatest investor to ever live I agree and what we&#39;ve heard a lot this week is about a lot of stocks and a lot of opportunities that have gone up a lot already okay and many of those will continue to go up there&#39;s there&#39;s a momentum type of investor and there&#39;s a mean reversion type of investor I&#39;m in the ladder Camp I like to buy opportunities when they&#39;re on sale I say Wall Street is the only place in the world when they throw a clearance sale everyone runs out of the store versus into the store uh so we&#39;re going to talk about a few Bargains and buying Bargains is not for the faint of heart but if you do accurate analysis and in-depth analysis you can get tremendous returns over time with patients with low leverage and following a sensible repeatable framework so a little bit about my backgrounds why you should listen to me or not listen to me uh I&#39;ve been doing this for a long time one and a half decades in the hedge fund business uh predominantly concentrated Equity Longs we do do tactical shorts from time to time when we think the market is overvalued or sector is overvalued or stock is overvalued or we just want to dampen volatility and we don&#39;t want to create tax events for our clients um maybe you see me on Fox Business I do cmbc International I do Yahoo finance Etc and hands up who saw the movie The Big Short well prior to starting my own firm I work for Brad pit okay in that movie his name was Ben Ricket in the movie Ben hocket in real life one of the smartest guys I&#39;ve ever met uh phenomenal experience at uh Cornwall Capital some of the smartest guys in the room they focus on asymmetric bets I can say he&#39;s not quite as handsome in person but he&#39;s much smarter than Brad Pit for sure uh and prior to that I was um at Bedford Oak advisor uh value shop the principal was friends with buff for 40 years so I have the privilege and blessing to travel to Omaha every single year uh some years on gabelli&#39;s private jet which was unbelievable for a young 30-some year old who grew up in New Jersey carrying golf bags at the golf course in the summer uh and Columbia University so that&#39;s some background now um we&#39; covered that we&#39;ve developed a reputation over time of benefiting from sector stock and General market dislocations uh and periods of distress that&#39;s kind of our knitting I got the nickname turnaround Tom because of that the people that have followed me for a long time the people who know me in the industry know I like to run in when people are running out of the crowded movie theater and see how many purses were left on the chairs and those are the opportunities uh to take advantage of as Mike said we have hedge fund tips.com WE Post our weekly podcast there it&#39;s called hedge fun tips with Tom Hayes very hard to remember uh it has become it has toggled between the one and two spot in the hedge fund category for podcast it&#39;s been going for 5 years 268 episodes and um what&#39;s actually happened by mistake is all of our clients have come in through listening to that podcast and the phone calls that I get are I&#39;ve been listening to you for 3 months I&#39;ve been listening to you for 6 months I&#39;ve been listening to you for a year I&#39;ve been listening to you for two years I&#39;ve made a ton of money off your ideas I&#39;m going to send you that money to manage because I&#39;m running a business I&#39;m running a real estate company have a career and um and Etc so uh that&#39;s how we do that and we make our money buying on weakness and selling on strength I know that&#39;s unpopular nowadays uh people like to buy things that are strong and hope that they get stronger and that&#39;s a strategy it&#39;s just two different type of strategies mean reversion is what we do uh momentum counting on inertia is what a lot lot of other people do uh and our confidence to step in when others are bailing is rooted in deep research and the premise that the more price becomes dislocated the more risk has actually come out of the asset versus gone in you know how many people feel like when a stock is falling oh that&#39;s risky I better not get in if the framework is correct and it&#39;s a cash generative company or God forbid the free cash flow is actually growing before the turnaround you&#39;re actually getting less risk as the price comes down and you can build a position over time uh most participants see volatility as increased risk we view it as increased opportunities so while many people look at the 52 we high list for opportunities uh we look at the 52 we low list not that&#39;s not our core place but we always want to pay attention to what sectors are down right now why are they down do they deserve to be down you know there are a lot of things that are cheap for a reason and you don&#39;t want to get caught in that trap either and that&#39;s kind of the the Special Sauce of doing it for so many years you start to figure out okay that sector no matter what happens you know a lot commodity stocks no matter what happens to the commodity they figure out how to lose money all day long a lot of mining stocks Etc um and this is kind of the ethos of our firm and our philosophy great investment opportunities come around when excellent companies are surrounded by unusual circumstances that cause the stock to be Mis appraised so uh some of you want to know where the Market&#39;s going next that&#39;s kind of not what we really do but we did want to put a couple slides up um uh this shows the Dow Jones Industrial Average by year of the decade since 1897 so 120 years of data and what we see on on average is uh like we saw in 2022 that was a down year the second year of the decade TS on average is down and you get some recovery in year three and four like we&#39;ve seen in the last two years and the middle part of the decade has a tendency to be strong now you look at this and say oh then I&#39;m going to go all in we&#39;ve just had this no but you start to say to yourself you look at the presidential cycle tends to be the the uh midterm elections you get a little weakness so I think Jeff hirch said it well yesterday he doesn&#39;t expect any type of material weakness until 2026 uh I think we probably get a little bit of a pullback after the inauguration if passes any prologue people are going to want to hold their stocks till uh through the end of the year but earnings are good and bsky said double digigit earnings growth double digit stock markets I think our base case for next year is somewhere between High single digits maybe 6 7 8 9% for the S&P to potentially low double digits 12% is our base case which implies you&#39;ll have your 5 and 10% normal pullbacks maybe in in the early part of the Year generally after new new president gets in you get the rally into the inauguration and then you get the first four to six months week that&#39;ll just be a time to find opportunity uh big picture here this just those long-term bull markets this is a a slide from uh Robert sler over at\n\n\n\n### MACRO_DATA_SLIDES\nppens to the commodity they figure out how to lose money all day long a lot of mining stocks Etc um and this is kind of the ethos of our firm and our philosophy great investment opportunities come around when excellent companies are surrounded by unusual circumstances that cause the stock to be Mis appraised so uh some of you want to know where the Market&#39;s going next that&#39;s kind of not what we really do but we did want to put a couple slides up um uh this shows the Dow Jones Industrial Average by year of the decade since 1897 so 120

start to say to yourself you look at the presidential cycle tends to be the the uh midterm elections you get a little weakness so I think Jeff hirch said it well yesterday he doesn&#39;t expect any type of material weakness until 2026 uh I think we probably get a little bit of a pullback after the inauguration if passes any prologue people are going to want to hold their stocks till uh through the end of the year but earnings are good and bsky said double digigit earnings growth double digit stock markets I think our base case for next year is somewhere between High single digits maybe 6 7 8 9% for the S&P to potentially low double digits 12% is our base case which implies you&#39;ll have your 5 and 10% normal pullbacks maybe in in the early part of the Year generally after new new president gets in you get the rally into the inauguration and then you get the first four to six months week that&#39;ll just be a time to find opportunity uh big picture here this just those long-term bull markets this is a a slide from uh Robert sler over at RBC\n\nRBC\n### MACRO_DATA_SLIDES\nand it shows you you know for the last 100 some odd years you have 18 to 20 years of consolidation followed by 18 to 20 years of expansion 18 to 20 years of consolidation if you look at the 70s 18 to 20 years of expansion which was 1982 to 2000 uh consolidation and now we&#39;re about halfway through uh expansion so most people think well it must be the time it must be 2000 everyone&#39;s getting excited about paler everyone&#39;s getting excited about Nvidia we must crash I don&#39;t think that&#39;s the case and if you actually overlay demographics over this the commonality between the periods of uh consolidation like 1930 to 1948 1968 to 1982 is demographics and right now we have very favorable demographics as many of you know uh the bulk of our population the echo is 33 34 years old housing formation family formation so we&#39;ve got a lot of gas in this tank and if sler is right uh a lot more upside I know Denny talks about 10,000 on the S&amp;P he&#39;s talking about just based on past Trends as high as 14,000 by the early 2030s okay turn around pick this is as boring as boring gets so if you get excited about CER you are going to fall asleep about Cooper standard and here&#39;s why they make the rubber ceiling that goes around the windows and the doors of automobiles okay who&#39;s excited about that all right so this was $146 stock in 2017 we started building a position for clients in May of 2022 we went public on Fox Business at around 550 and you say okay where where were you in 2022 why do you tell me about it now when the Stock&#39;s up 3x it&#39;s 200% uh about a $15 stock because it&#39;s been der risked and the story is just getting started so what was happening in 2017 is you had a sell through in the United States of about 17.5 million cars okay we fell in this cycle down to 15.3 million if you go back over the last 45 years every cycle uh pee troughs in the low 15 every cycle peaks in the high 17s to low 18 million right now we&#39;re at 15.8 million Sor the operating leverage of this business is such that they&#39;ve taken all the costs out of the business and every few hundred th000 few hundred th000 cars as we go from 158 of the bottom of the cycle to 177 half or 18 uh this business can generate $3 a share in earnings okay when we got involved with this stock you had something terrible called solvency risk okay those are two words you generally don&#39;t want to hear when you&#39;re getting into an investment they had to refinance about a billion dollars worth of debt in Fall of 2022 and Legend over here David kotak who&#39;s one of the best Bond people in the business an absolute Legend over over decades I just had a chance to meet him he&#39;s going to speak next uh tell you in Fall of 2020 was not the best time to refinance high yield debt it was a scary time the markets were closed and uh we got in on the basis that they had more than enough asset coverage that they would get it done one way or another and number one number two there was a lot of private credit swirling around so if they couldn&#39;t get it done on their own uh we could find a way to get them in front of people with credit uh private credit to get it refinanced long story short they got it refinanced Goldman charged them an arm and a leg and three four five legs but they got it done uh refinance risk was off the table and the stock shot off you know $5 $10 it shot up to $20 uh now back to 15 now I&#39;d love to say I&#39;m a genius and I thought of this all by myself but when I was I I asked uh some people asked what is what would Jesus do I asked what would Warren do I also asked what would Charlie do and I copied this idea from Charlie Munger who did the exact same trade in one of the six cycal Auto troughs in 2001 with a little company called tenaco okay who&#39;s heard of Monroe shock absorbers Dynamax exhaust products Etc and here&#39;s the beauty of what Charlie did he read an article in Barons uh about Teno having to refinance about a billion dollar of debt and he put $10 million into the equity and from that 10 million when they got refinanced and the cycle came back he turned the 10 million into 80 million and then he gave the 80 million to a guy named leelu to who started investing in China when no one was interested in China and you turn the 80 million into a half a billion so two chess moves a half a billion dollars who&#39;s interested in that okay so was Charlie buying the things that were already up 10x 20x 30X or was he buying the things that were out of favor that had a catalyst to turn around to take advantage the ladder right so that&#39;s exactly what&#39;s happening right now with Cooper standard we&#39;ve met with management multi mult multiple times we have confidence in their abilities um they also a lot of times when these small cap companies get into trouble they don&#39;t respect Equity so they issue a lot of shares they dilute the shareholders they&#39;ve actually brought the share count down while going through one of the most difficult periods in the Auto industry this is turning up we&#39;ve already tough the operating leverage they&#39;re now at break even they&#39;ve taken $500 million of cost out of the business as you see and the the number one leading indicator of Industry Auto volume for new cars is incentives okay and you&#39;ll see here incentives first off this chart on the top is the global light vehicle production forecast so as you can see this is very conservative right now because people are still pessimistic they expect it to go back to 2017 levels uh by 2028 we think it&#39;s going to happen sooner but on that basis um Cooper standard at that peak level earned $7 a share $719 a share and earnings in 2017 the stock traded at $146 we believe when we get those type of volumes whether it&#39;s 2027 or 2028 based on how the business has been uh better managed they&#39;re going to earn well more than $7 a share they could earn $10 a share and Beyond and the only question is what multiple is going to be applied to the stock a off multiple of 10 times or a peak multiple of 20 times so we think it&#39;s it&#39;s got huge upside even from $15 never mind $5 this will be a 10 to 15 bagg or overtime for us um so that&#39;s that that that&#39;s the incentives you can see going straight up our and if you thought that one was hairy okay I got one that&#39;s even hairier for you it&#39;s called Advanced Auto Parts you guys ever seen an advanced auto parts in your neighborhood okay this is the worst performing Auto retailer of all three Okay so whether you&#39;re talking about O&#39;Reilly etc etc the good news is they probably have the best CEO who&#39;s just come in his name is Shane o Kelly he ran HD Supply in uh for for Home Depot uh $7 billion business he&#39;s got a military background Harvard part business school he knows how to run these businesses and what he&#39;s basically done is he took solvency risk off the table recently by selling the Canadian business that was non- synergistic he created a $1.5 billion doar in cash for that net 1.2 uh paying down debt so he&#39;s brought the leverage ratios down to buy him time for the turn around and then he closed 10% of the stores on the west coast that were all spread out so you see that footprint of all the red dots all of those on the east coast is great where in most markets they&#39;re number one or number two and they have synergies and they have uh opportunity to really generate cash they closed they sold to Canada paid down the balance sheet they closed 700 stores on the west coast that were all spread out and now they&#39;re going to lower the the distribution centers from 38 to13 uh he expects to increase operating margins by 500 basis points over the next few years what that means in English they&#39;re going to generate $600 million in operating income and on that basis the last two three times that they generated $600 million plus of operating income was 2018 2019 and 2022 the stock is currently 45 bucks uh in those instances when they were generating that type of operating income the stock was $186 $182 and $240 I&#39;m not saying that it&#39;s going to go back there but I am saying there&#39;s an enormous opportunity again operating leverage Catalyst it&#39;s been der risked solvency risk has come off the table they sold off non-core assets same same type of story and this is how we can create doubles triples and stuff over a reasonable amount of time be patient build the position and wait good things come to those who wait right um and then\n\nthe good news is they probably have the best CEO who&#39;s just come in his name is Shane o Kelly he ran HD Supply in uh for for Home Depot uh $7 billion business he&#39;s got a military background Harvard part business school he knows how to run these businesses and what he&#39;s basically done is he took solvency risk off the table recently by selling the Canadian business that was non- synergistic he

is Etsy who&#39;s heard of etsy okay so you have two choices in the next three weeks you can go on to Amazon you can scatter shot a bunch of chocolate baskets that&#39;s no one ever going to eat unpersonalized your business clients your family is going to say oh yeah you did the minimum congratulations uh you thought of me barely uh or you can go on to Etsy and get them something beautifully engraved with the most important thing to every single person with their own name on it okay and get a customized thing and they&#39;ve built a tremendous business in doing customized stuff it was a covid darling the stock ran up to over $300 a share it&#39;s now uh we initiate at $49 I think it&#39;s still what is it what is it Jeff $49 55 okay so uh so we&#39;re up on that one barely uh but here&#39;s the name of the game ladies and gentlemen when I talk about a framework looking under the surface and understanding what you buy I think about it in terms of private equity in the public markets what would I pay for the entire business if JP Morgan was going to finance me to buy the whole company and I had to put 100% of my net worth up for the equity of the purchase um look at the free those purple bars are the free cash generation of etsy so does it look like the free cash flow has gone down a whole lot since the stock was trading at $300 okay so if the stock was priced you know Mr Market is a manic depressive and AIC euphoric okay so you&#39;re seeing a little bit of the manic euphorics uh a little bit uh this week and and some of the manic depresses and stock like this but you know when I look at this if you were going to go buy 10 Jersey Mike&#39;s franchises is that Big Dam here at the Subway shop and you know you looked at the guy you would look at the financials by the way I know a lot of people don&#39;t like to look at financials before they buy a stock but if you were going to buy a whole business you would look at the financials right and if the free cash flow the amount back to owners back to you as the purchaser was basically the same over the last 10 years would you try to buy it at 20% of what it was worth a few years ago the guy would literally call security guards and have you escorted out of the building because you were insulting and you were completely irrational except every day in the public markets you get opportunities like this where if you would actually present it to the board I&#39;ll buy the whole company at the price that it&#39;s quoted in the market they would call security and have you think you were a Looney Tune but that happens every day so stock price down 80% free cash flow generation to owners not only about par puru with when it was a $300 stock uh but re accelerating growth they&#39;re turning it around they did make some mistakes but they did keep 92 million users it&#39;s the fourth most trafficed website on for e-commerce site in the US how many of you knew that Etsy I had no idea I asked my wife what is Etsy does anyone use it um and that&#39;s one of their initiatives loyalty programs they&#39;re they&#39;re initiating downloaded apps gifting International all of these initiatives and Josh Silverman who is the CEO has a proven track record of winning when he was at Skype they increased users by 300 million in just a few years uh he&#39;s got a track record of many successful companies and he&#39;s going to do the exact same thing at Etsy through some of these initiatives um so men International gifting loyalty program apps download and cleaning up the curation of the website Etc there was was a period there for a couple of years where they had some counterfeit and cheap products and that kind of turned people off they&#39;re fixing that problem you know I had a an anchor asked me like uh are they doing a good job and I said the answer is no the stock&#39;s down 85% uh that&#39;s the bad news the good news is they recognize the problem they&#39;re fixing it and we&#39;re seeing re accelerating growth and this is a phenomenal Niche platform the other reason I like it it&#39;s not a me too platform where everyone&#39;s selling the same product and it&#39;s a race to the bottom with price and margins which you&#39;re never going to win against Amazon right they don&#39;t have to have the same type of margin here it&#39;s bestok products it&#39;s custom products it&#39;s gifted products it&#39;s supporting small businesses uh and the runway is just getting started if you look at the total addressable Market Etc um by the way anytime you hear in investment presentation if you hear the word total addressable Market what they&#39;re trying to tell you is here&#39;s why you should pay 20 times sales for this business run the other way but in this case uh it&#39;s trading at a meaningful discount and they have a very small percentage of this this growing uh and narrow group and I have one final bonus stock uh turnaround Tom pick for you today and uh that is oh by the way uh my analyst Jeff put this beautiful slide together uh they&#39;re generating about 600 million of free cash flow every single year does that sound like they have solvency risk no okay balance sheet is delevered the the free cash flow is growing over the next 5 years they&#39;re going to generate uh about enough cash where you could buy in 60% of the stock they just announced a$1 billion buyback authorization so um you know 1.2 billion of cash on the balance sheet 2.3 billion long-term debt re accelerating growth we like these type of opportunities and\n\n### FEATURED_COMPANY_DEEP_DIVES\nthey had some counterfeit and cheap products and that kind of turned people off they're fixing that problem you know I had a an anchor asked me like uh are they doing a good job and I said the answer is no the stock's down 85% uh that's the bad news the good news is they recognize the problem they're fixing it and we're seeing re accelerating growth and this is a phenomenal Niche platform the other reason I like it it's not a me too platform where everyone's selling the same product and it's a race to the bottom with price and margins which you're never going to win against Amazon right they don't have to have the same type of margin here it's bestok products it's custom products it's gifted products it's supporting small businesses uh and the runway is just getting started if you look at the total addressable Market Etc um by the way anytime you hear in investment presentation if you hear the word total addressable Market what they're trying to tell you is here's why you should pay 20 times sales for this business run the other way but in this case uh it's trading at a meaningful discount and they have a very small percentage of this this growing uh and narrow group and I have one final bonus stock\n### FEATURED_COMPANY_DEEP_DIVES\nfinally  is Boeing you can't give away this stock people are trading it like it's going out of business uh except they've got a new CEO Kelly orberg who when he was at Rockwell Collins in six years he forx the company for owners he made them four times their money in six years this guy is an absolute winner they've solved the issue with the unions and by the way they've got a half a trillion dollar backlog the demand for flying is going up not down China's going to double their Fleet by 2043 and they've got a half a trillion dollars of backlog imagine if your Jersey Mike Subway franchises had 10 years worth of backlog for sandwiches you know orders already in que already uh committed already paid for and there was no other Subway shop that they could go to if they got tired of waiting uh in the case of Boeing you got Boeing you got Airbus we like duopolistic and oligopolistic businesses that have pricing power Boeing is one of those we see a tremendous opportunity there and then uh\n\n### FEATURED_COMPANY_DEEP_DIVES\nis Boeing you can&#39;t give away this stock people are trading it

one or two\n\nquestions  we&#39;ll do one or two\n### ASK_ME_ANYTHING_QA\nquestions  now and Tom&#39;s going to be on the panel later so if you don&#39;t get a chance to ask now we&#39;ll definitely have some time for that I&#39;m standing here with the microphone so Amazon is what the biggest company really for consumers there these Chinese companies coming in Shen and T and are there are there investment opportuni with those as well uh you opened up a can of worms because if I start talking about Alibaba today we&#39;re going to be here till 4:00 look uh we&#39;ve got a tremendous uh position in Alibaba okay and this has taken longer than we&#39;ve expected to work but we&#39;ve had an opportunity to bring down our basis in our view it&#39;s the uh best price is what you pay values what you get we we think it&#39;s the best opportunity globally they international business to your point Alibaba Express is growing at 30% pindu Duo is a competitor with timu uh I think timu if uh pindu do I believe their numbers are either unsustainable or unreliable and you&#39;re seeing them get shut down in a lot of markets like Vietnam Alibaba does quality business and Alibaba will is the toll taker in China if you believe that the government will continue to do stimulus if you believe that they will recover like they do every cycle just like Autos recover every cycle uh and it&#39;s the cheapest covert play in China because they are the number one cloud provider and what they do is with every AI startup they say don&#39;t worry about it you don&#39;t have to give us money we&#39;ll give you compute power which costs us basically nothing you give us Equity so they&#39;ve got equity in every single startup AI startup in China and that&#39;s given zero value right now on the stock price you&#39;re going to see some of these things be thousand Baggers and we own them indirectly as owners of alib so we that&#39;s a perfect play and it&#39;s one of our largest positions so your spot on we&#39;ll do one more yeah what do you think about super micro at will they get their financial reporting issues taken care of and their future please uh super micro wow um you know that was one when it was going straight up I said what would Jesus do and then I said well Jesus didn&#39;t give me an answer I said okay what would Warren Buffet do and uh and Warren Buffet would in touch him with a 10ft pole so we took a pass as far as as companies that have accounting irregularities that is a huge red flag um obviously there&#39;s substance to their underlying business but when you have that type of thing it&#39;s a don&#39;t touch and and I live my life under a very simple framework I am perfectly comfortable with making errors of omission like I I have no fomo fomo is not in my DNA like if if I see someone make a 100x on something that I wasn&#39;t participant like I&#39;m super happy for them like I don&#39;t think my way is the only way I just figured out after doing it long enough I&#39;m really good at one little thing and this is what I&#39;m good at and I just do that and there are tons of ways to make money so um the short answer to your question is I don&#39;t touch companies that have a history of accounting irregularities it&#39;s just a don&#39;t touch because you know if you see a few cockroaches you don&#39;t know how much damage is underneath the sheetrock and uh and touched it exactly the wrong moment what&#39;s that what if you touched it at exactly it you&#39;re in it and deciding what exactly the wrong moment right before the problem oh okay right before the problem sometimes you got to take your lumps we all do um I would I would I would say two things number one is if you&#39;re going to harvest a loss do you have if you have gains in other stocks that you&#39;re going to be paying tax on next year you might want to harvest that loss and use that use that tax asset against the games now&#39;s a good time to do it before the end of the year uh opinion not advice um but if you&#39;re going to hold on to it you better get on the conference calls and be very darn sure that you feel comfortable that the the error was explainable rational and you feel comfortable in the financials and then again prices what you pay what you get even though it&#39;s fallen down what is the value of it how much you know is it are you comfortable with the current valuation assuming that it&#39;s correct uh but for me I I I run the other way from some of those guys yeah I think that&#39;s it thank you very much and we&#39;re back and then we had a segment uh panel segment which I would strongly encourage you to listen to you can find it on YouTube Just Google hedge fund tips it&#39;s called part two the panel that was with Mish Schneider who you see all the time on Charles P on Fox Business uh great to be on with her and Legend Sam stoval who&#39;s been a market strategist also had dinner with him uh and Jose Torres from interactive brokers at the Scott Walker uh former Scott Walker uh governor of Wisconsin event on Thursday night this was a great segment but we&#39;re not going to take 30 minutes to play it I would encourage you because we go in depth into Emerging Markets China and you might find that very helpful we just have too many amas and stuff to get through today and\n\n### MACRO_DATA_SLIDES\nlook if you listen carefully to my presentation I alluded to the fact that 99% of the speakers that I saw over those 3 days were talking about things that have already gone up a ton as if they&#39;re the newest best idea ever and none of them or few of them were to be found at the bottom in the hole in Fall of 2022 when we were buying Amazon and Google and made easy doubles so it&#39;s just something to be cognizant of it doesn&#39;t mean it can&#39;t go more it just says some of these valuations on the concentrated magev are stretched as a matter of fact one of the things going to talk about today is the fact that since I posted that article on June 20th uh with Jenson Wong on the on the cover of the article you can go back to hedge fund tips commentary signing that girl&#39;s front area with a marker uh Nvidia has had negative returns since June of this year and you would not guess that based on the continued Euphoria around around the stock okay and um it&#39;s something to be cognizant of so Price to Book Tech bubble Peak it doesn&#39;t mean we&#39;re going to crash or Tech&#39;s going to crash or anything like that I think it does mean they are going to underperform relative to the unmagnify and xus and we&#39;re going to talk about some reasons why this is beauty to my eyes this is the Cox Automotive incentives are booming we jumped up again I think we at 7.6 last time we&#39;re at 8% of sales price sales prices ticked up a hair but they&#39;ve been basically flatlining for the last two plus years incentives are going up what is the number one key indicator of future volumes is incentives and this is exciting especially when we got a 16.5 mil SAR number last month uh when you annualize it out we are moving in the right direction as po per my presentation but this data is new as of today uh annual new stock BuyBacks continue to climb overall distressed rates by property type you&#39;ll see that office is still climbing a little bit retail is leveling off and Self Storage is rolling over as well as industrial rolling over you had a little bit of spike in the summer and that&#39;s come back down 007 Wells Fargo SE the S&amp;P 500 at 7,7 in 2025 highest forecast on Wall Street so again this is stuff that you see all the time opinion follows Trend which um leads me to believe it&#39;s probably overshooting in the short term we&#39;re going to talk about some targets out there uh our base case is 8 to 12% next year maybe a little lower because the index is so impact Ed by the weights of the mag 7 and we think they&#39;re going to perform less well along with the closet indexers and we&#39;ll talk about why it has to do with correlations which are at an all-time low us beige book activity index that&#39;s turning back up uh says economy stable companies more optimistic about 2025 but tariffs a worry what you saw from Trump number one he extended an a long Olive Branch to xiin Ping this week by inviting him to his inauguration number one and number two he&#39;s put people around him that understand that if we destroy China it&#39;s mutually assured destruction and uh certainly we want to extract more tariffs and put America First and at the same time we want to benefit when we can benefit from those areas that we we want to uh get certain Goods at lower cost that are you know we&#39;re unwilling to produce here and uh and there&#39;s a uh beneficial nature to that type of relationship and I&#39;m sure they&#39;ll find their way to the table you know starting at 60% then dropping to 25% then inviting to the inauguration you can see a trend here if you&#39;re paying attention trailing 12- Monon PE ratios I don&#39;t tend to look at a lot of trailing but you can see Tech is above their historical median um you got us m&amp;a at a low just getting ready to tick up that&#39;s not something you see right before recessions what you see is a dramatic acceleration and I think we&#39;re going to start that dramatic acceleration of m&amp;a in the next 12 to 24 months uh which puts the next cycle short-term top out uh probably a couple years from now uh I think the rockiness is more likely in 2026 and a bit in 2020 7 more likely than not than it is in 2025 even though we&#39;ll probably scare a few people early in the year um you see the Chinese uh CSI 300 breaking out back testing trying to move ahead this week I think we&#39;re going to start to see some follow through if past is any prologue we&#39;ve covered it multiple times in the last two weeks um what you see is is you see uh as soon as the calendar turned before the inauguration last time um massive massive spike in\n\n### MACRO_DATA_SLIDES\nwhy it has to do with correlations which are at an all-time low us

elevated last time we were that elevated you saw a selloff in Tech in 2022 and value stocks outperform so something to keep in the back of your mind uh what we worry percent of investors who think there&#39;s less than a 10% probability of a crash let me see if I can make this a little bit bigger for you ladies and gentlemen there you go uh right here record 30 billion inflow into small cap funds surpassing 29 billion in 2021 so that game starting to go I will say I&#39;m keeping an eye on our kre small cap you know we took profits on Bank of America and City over the summer after big moves um I think K&#39;s got some more juice and there&#39;s going to be a lot of consolidation but it&#39;s also had a huge move so I&#39;m going to keep an eye on that after the beginning of the year uh annual distribution of S&amp;P total returns over the last 100 years so you can see those years that had 15 to 20% returns 30 to to 35% returns 30 to 35 happened uh looks like 11% of the time and the bell curve here so uh these years are you know not normal but they&#39;re not completely outside the realm of possibility and if you look at the late 90s which we&#39;re going to do today you&#39;ll see they were several years strung together at that level uh this is a different chart of that S&P 500 Price to Book ratio now exceeds the March 2000 High so you look you got to just respect this now you could say to me uh well that was a different time the businesses were more Capital intensive you know there&#39;s something to be said for that but at the same time just pay

think that&#39;s going to be pushed off to late 26 if not 2027 so When the Music&#39;s dancing you got to get up When the Music&#39;s playing you got to get up and dance uh credit spread&#39;s coming

Central bank&#39;s cutting rates at the fastest Pace since May 20 64 Cuts already this 62 Cuts already this year just getting started last two times may have two 20 May of 2000 we were pound the table buyers April of 2009 these were times to be buyers not sellers uh currently takes 8 months on average to build a single family house uh so that has started to rise again in the last four years that could have something to do with supplies it could have something to do with regulation uh hopefully they can make it easier to get zoning and get the supply that we need going and this will start to come down and that will be positive for affordability for young people trying to start a family encourage more people to have babies which we need as a society um this is the spread between the household survey and the establishment survey so while the establishment survey for the employment levels was positive under the surface it wasn&#39;t that great which is why you&#39;re seeing 96% odds of a hike excuse me 90% odds of a cut next week and I think that&#39;s all we&#39;re going to need for a while and I think after that I think they can play the wait and see game and maybe sit on their hands until March and one two more Cuts in 2025 and we&#39;re done we got a midcycle uh intervention they went big early and uh they saved the day and uh I think that Powell is going to go out like Seinfeld at the top and um do exactly what he wanted to do it&#39;s not to say inflation&#39;s not going to come back in fits and starts but I think he&#39;s going to largely be able to declare Victory uh and part of that&#39;s going to be a function of Doge cutting cost we&#39;re going to talk about that as well Mark this is the us6 unemployment rate underemployment has been going up since 2022 so keeping an eye on that that should keep the FED easy for a little while longer well into 2025 um rate cut in December we&#39; covered that two-year yields yields dropped they they kind of did a dead cap bounce here in the last few days but they&#39;ve been coming down since November as we anticipated bonds get bid in November December and that should follow through in 2025 consumer sentiment is ticking up since the election ### TECHNICAL_CHARTS\num here&#39;s the Nvidia okay so it peaked out at 14074 literally the day before I wrote that article on June 20th and since then we&#39;ve had exactly zero gains first we had an immediate 35% drop so that was pretty nice call and then um we recovered and now we&#39;re back down literally negative this is the hottest stock that people can&#39;t get get enough down at you know wherever it was in the 2020 lows you couldn&#39;t give it away now everybody wants it and that&#39;s why you&#39;re seeing some distribution here the question is what will be the magnitude of this distribution and I think ### MISCELLANEOUS\nrecord inflows for us ETFs so again this this theme I I saw it felt it heard it over the week uh us only don&#39;t touch International you know pile into all these stocks that are trading at 40 times 100 times sales it&#39;s going to be okay they&#39;re going to change the world and all day long talking about Tams the minute people start talking about total addressable markets run the hell out of the room because it&#39;s just code to sell you something that&#39;s trading at 10 20 30 40 50 times sales which on average with the exception of the Zer environment of the 10-year period from you know 2019 to 2022 uh where you actually made money buying stocks trading at 10 times sales and making no money uh every other decade since 1890 you got decimated decimated in the sense that They Carried you out in a Stretcher and you never came back and you joined the military or you went to flipping burgers or driving a taxi uh and I think as rates normalize the people who are buying 20 30 40 50 time sales and losing money or making a little bit money are going to get carried out in a Stretcher so um percentile of s it sentiment indicators you can see here it&#39;s getting frothy and if you look at the things that are moving not dissimilar to 2021 not dis similar to 99 2000 you want to avoid those and even if you get a pullback in those groups uh and you&#39;re buying quality under the surface which has been you know right now we are in tax loss selling Ser season so from December 10th to December 20th you will see uh some weakness in the things that have been weak before the Santa Claus rally and then they&#39;ll start to get bit as we turn the calendar um so just be cognizant of that this is the country composition of the msci world index it&#39;s like us is like 67% of the index and some I don&#39;t know it&#39;s like half of that in terms of global GDP China&#39;s 5% and like 16% of global GDP so this is this is an extreme the rubber band is stretched as far as the rubber band can go and it&#39;s going to reverse back exports from China picked up just after the election so people are frontloading stuff sentiment around the consumer reached the highest level in almost 3 years in Q3 earnings calls uh second half of December has historically been the second strongest period of the year so after the tax loss selling is done in the next handful of days we should see some strength into the end of the year this is Mike zardi since 1978 dividends and reinvested dividends have contributed 69% of the US Stock markets total return helping an $10,000 investment grow o to over 1.6 million 69% were dividends and reinvested dividends so keep that in mind when you got companies like CCI and Stanley Black and&amp; Decker and uh some you know uh great companies like that Disney increasing their dividend by$ 30 3% in the last 64 years there were only six years where dividend levels declined and only one where they fell by more than 5% the only time they fell was 2009 in the early 2000s every other year they increased the dividends so when you get a chance to buy a great company that is down a lot in price and you can lock in an aberrational yield of four five 6 7% with a dividend grower you wind up with these situations like Buffett did with cocacola in 1999 I think he gets like more dividends per year from his Coca-Cola position than his initial basis because not only do you lock in a great yield but the dividend continues to grow and compound over the years and that&#39;s where you wind up with these huge yields with no taxable capital gains you pay dividend income over those years um and and uh that&#39;s pretty pretty exciting dividends have grown an average of 5.7% a year more than uh 2% above the rate of inflation uh this is from Jeff hir over at stock Traders Almanac talking about the seasonal pattern for small caps uh get strong mid December and all the way through March so that benefits companies like Cooper standard like Goose like uh some of the smaller com Comstock resources is off the charts that&#39;s almost a double already as a matter of fact I had a friend emailed me today he said my first two doubles from hedge fund tips with Tom ha uh so I was excited to hear that he had I think his doubles were comto and gener if if he didn&#39;t make gener or he&#39;s just a couple dollars short with gener so that&#39;s exciting uh the second theme okay so what else do we have ah this is the most important chart in my view the backdrop for stock Pickers is the best in 25 years with correlation of stock performance at alltime lows so when did we have this it last you had in 201718 after that big draw down from 1516 and you rallied straight through uh 2020 you also had it in when of course uh the 2003 2005 period when small caps and international took off and you had it in Earnest in 2001 which we&#39;ve covered we cover almost every week comparing it and and the stage set prior to the biggest rally in the shortest amount of time uh from 2002 to 2007 for [Music] um emerging markets and four small cap second theme focus is on Trump&#39;s pledge to make for an easier regulatory backdrop financials manufacturing energy are key Focus points they expect financials could see the biggest impact from deregulatory Stand but also that small and midcap stock should outperform given their higher domestic us exposure especially those exposed to financials and Industrials so us exposure you&#39;re talking small caps and that should be and I think the surprise is going to be at last you know four or five months big rally and then it kind of cools off for a little bit when the honeymoon is over and then we see the policies and the impact and all that stuff this is the long-term price Channel we&#39;ve been riding the bottom for many many years and now we&#39;re working towards the top and that&#39;s how Deutsche Bank gets to this 7, 7100 uh Target over the next year or so uh we shall see opun uh this shows the trough in December tends to be the 15th before rallying into the end of the year so maybe a little more wobble into uh Monday Tuesday and then uh start Santa starts to come to town after the tax loss selling is in the rear viw mirror one-year price expectations for rent rolling over this is good for long-term inflation this argues against the Arthur Burns feere that Powell has lived with for many years of inflation coming back like in the&#39; 70s uh here we go Financial Outlook much better off and then let&#39;s pull up some slomer to see some long-term\n\n correlation of stock performance at alltime lows so when did we have this it last you had in 201718 after that big draw down from 1516 and you rallied straight through uh 2020 you also had it in when of course uh the 2003 2005 period when small caps and international took off and you had it in Earnest in 2001 which we've covered we cover almost every week comparing it and and the stage set prior to the biggest rally in the shortest amount of time uh from 2002 to 2007 for emerging markets and four small cap\n### MACRO_DATA_SLIDES\nsecond theme focus is on Trump's pledge to make for an easier regulatory backdrop financials manufacturing energy are key Focus points they expect financials could see the biggest impact from deregulatory Stand but also that small and midcap stock should outperform given their higher domestic us exposure especially those exposed to financials and Industrials so us exposure you're talking small caps and that should be and I think the surprise is going to be at last you know four or five months big rally and then it kind of cools off for a little bit when the honeymoon is over and then we see the policies and the impact and all that stuff this is the long-term price Channel we've been riding the bottom for many many years and now we're working towards the top and that's how Deutsche Bank gets to this 7, 7100 uh Target over the next year or so uh we shall see opun uh this shows the trough in December tends to be the 15th before rallying into the end of the year so maybe a little more wobble into uh Monday Tuesday and then uh start Santa starts to come to town after the tax loss selling is in the rear viw mirror one-year price expectations for rent rolling over this is good for long-term inflation this argues against the Arthur Burns feere that Powell has lived with for many years of inflation coming back like in the' 70s uh here we go Financial Outlook much better off and then let's pull up some slomer to see some long-term charts from\n\nRBC  Trend in cycle here we go okay here's the S&P a lot of people looking at this 6600 Target I guess that's um some fibon f Fibonacci extension level then you've got 7,000 for 261 extension that's probably a year and a half off um 50,000 on the Dow that's a 26.8 extension they're talking about man there's a lot of bullishness in all this just be careful what you're buying because the beauty is if you buy it enough under intrinsic value even if the market Market pulls back because these High Flyers get smoked uh you don't have to worry about it and if you're running low to no leverage you definitely don't have to worry about it and that's where we' like to play uh

268 it's probably you know 30 40% higher uh which would be constructive Europe is right here you know Europe is easing and easing aggressively so I wouldn't discount Europe I think there's a lot to do

up right before a parabolic move higher uh here's the 10-year yield remember here everyone said five we said no this is a counter Trend rolling over that's exactly what it's doing us uh 10-year uh yield rolling over dollar little fake out above this uh resistance line now rolling back over all in line everything is per playing out perfectly and the temporarily detour is Trump got elected surprised the Chinese a little bit and they did the exact same Playbook that they did in 2016 I don't know like I'm not asking them to read history from like a hundred years like it's amazing how short the memory is this is literally eight years ago and no one remembers they did the exact same thing Trump says I'm going to tar off you the Chinese said no big deal you want to Tar of us 20% we'll devalue the the Yuan by 20% like this is not rocket science and then Trump's like oh wait well then we don't really get any benefit no kidding so then you get to the table and you come up with the deal and everyone's happy and everyone makes money and that's the name of the game and the exact same thing that's happening which is why you saw a little strength into Yan in in the dollar you know the Chinese Trump got elected dollar rallies bonds sell off same thing after the inauguration bonds rally dollar sells off Emerging Markets go up just against what everyone positioned for what

office 2017 it literally collapses down all the way through the end of the year and I think we're going to see a very similar situation that no one's positioned for and what happened at the same time while the dollar was collapsing in his first year emerging markets were rallying as well as China Baba same thing turn of the calendar straight up $84 to $187 like you guys can't even like you think

it is is I&#39;m bullish under the surface in xus I&#39;m neutral on the things that have already run I think they do okay I think they underperform and then you look at some of these indicators they&#39;re not anywhere near extreme so we&#39;re not at Euphoria which is like climbing the wall of worry pushing that $7 trillion money market money back in BuyBacks are still going uh cut came down a little bit in the last few weeks who holds the US debt this is kind of interesting everyone&#39;s worried about China selling off the debt they own 2% of our debt so Federal Reserve owns 15% mutual funds own 11% depository institutions that got whacked because of Powell forced them to buy it all in 2021 and he pulled out the rug from underneath them they all had the mark to Market state and local governments 5% Pension funds 3% insurance companies 1% US savings bonds 177% of us treasuries Japan 3% China 2% UK 2% other countries 15% % so UK owns as much us treasuries as China does that&#39;s mind-boggling when you think about it us small business optimism has gone parabolic just like it did when right after the 2016 election guys history doesn&#39;t repeat but it Rhymes over

a lot left and it shows the history and kind of where we are right now is this little red line so yeah you could get some consolidation here but there&#39;s a tendency for these things to go I think we&#39;re halfway through the secular bull last 18 years we broke out in uh 2014 we&#39;re 10 years in we probably have another 8 years is basically where I&#39;m at and if you look at demographics

saw the shift the China us China to us 10-year yield spread uh the last time that it got this low -200 basis points uh was basically 2001 and then again in 2004 2005 and you can see what happened following this period where you had this spread in yields you had the biggest rally in the shortest amount of time uh in history so all these things are setting up no one's paying attention to it instead they want to buy every stock that's been up you know huge amount triple digits they all want to buy it now and be the bag holders for the people who are buying it in 2022 manufacturing headwind set to ease with the global monetary easing cycle in action now so what you can see\n\n### MACRO_DATA_SLIDES\nhere is the hangsang index why am i showing you the hangsang index in 2003

who are buying it in 2022 manufacturing headwind set to ease with the global monetary easing cycle in action now so what you can see\n\nglobal manufacturing PMI has lagged the percentage of central banks easing in easing mode which is now uh looks like it's at uh 70% of central banks are in easing mode you can see PMI always catches up that's manufacturing here bounced off this trend line as we had anticipated everyone said five five five we said counter Trend bounce and it's rolling back over so now we're getting a bounce people are going to start saying five again and they're going to be wrong again um China Golden Dragon index breakout back test rolling back up we're going straight up in 2025 in my humble opinion this is all opinion not advice go to hedge fund tips.com click on terms and forward PE ratio again skewed high due to those seven stocks okay this is interesting from Tom Lee over at fun Strat and what he's basically saying is we're going to have more subdued returns in 2025 and all the gains are going to be front loaded and the second half is going to be weak I'm more in line with the the front half is going to be more subdued and the back half is going to re rally so his rationale for that is he looked at what I'm looking at is the presidential cycle uh after the inauguration you get the excitement into the inauguration you kind of get a little consolidation and weakness after the the and then the back half of the first year is better midterm year is worse uh what he's looking at is just randomly picking all years where you had two years of 20% plus gains and what the pattern looked like and they continued the gains into the first half and then they got weak the second half um you know we buy good companies when they're marked down that's that's what can I tell you uh Mike zakari going for three in a row in 2025 five of the last seven so this is S&P rally 20% each year from 1995 to 1999 why that's an interesting comparison and prior to that was uh the mid-40s and the early 50s is because we just went through that midcycle fed intervention like 1995 which we've been using as an analog for so long so you got to be open-minded that next year could be better than everyone expects but um prepare for the wor you know expect for the expect the best prepare for the worst is is usually good good way to think about it uh investment sentiment is euphoric that you know that doesn't always mean something coming off these big troughs it can continue especially these big Cycles you you bounced right up in 2009 2010 but you still kept going uh it bodess for some consolidation and I'm thinking after the inauguration in February we'll get a little weakness uh but we'll we'll take it as it comes uncertainty and mean reversion Drive gold speculative l uh this is looking like net long managed money on the comx is looking like other previous Peaks going back through 20 2016 you saw 2017 20120 and now I look here's the gold chart we told you up here that we wouldn't be buyers we're kind of agnostic I don't know if it corrects but um I think they're better higher and better uses 2025 year ahead better first half wor second half that's what uh Tom Lee is suggesting political party in control all red Equity return annual going back to 1900 is 7.7% annualized Which is less than people think so that's something to keep in mind that also speaks to probably xus better dollar weak xus equities better we will see I think you know why why you see these type of things is because you see dramatic change setting the platform setting the stage for the next phase of growth so let's see what happens there tax cut to 15% from 21% is estimated to be 4% benefit to the S&P with greatest benefit to Consumer discretionary at 6.8% communication services at 5.1 you know consumer discretionary VF Corp we love it here's Nvidia again no gains since that article in June uh structural underperformance interrupted by multi-year rallies this is the Euro area versus the US this is a downward linear regression line with plus and minus one standard deviation I think that this does Bode quite well for Europe versus us in coming years and um it also look looks to the earnings Trend and when you consider they're going to be easing more aggressively than we are there's something to be said for that catch-up trade selectively where you don't get burned by just taking a basket you pick the best value at the lowest price and you benefit from these mean reversion opportunities it is uh Do or Die day here on the semiconductor index bouncing up against this 5200 day moving average\n\nwhen you&#39;re buying I mean look the best lesson I can give you ladies and gentlemen is when you&#39;re buying the companies that we&#39;re buying on balance over time cash flow and revenues go like this and price goes like this around the free cash flow intrinsic value and what we try to do is we just buy when price is down here even though cash flow really hasn&#39;t changed and revenue really hasn&#39;t changed it&#39;s just slowly growing up on Trend over 10 20 30 40 years the longer the better for us so we can see how it acts through cycles and then we get just get Mr Market despondency uh for accumulation and Mr Market Euphoria for distribution that is that&#39;s our model right there it&#39;s not rocket science that&#39;s that&#39;s all we do so um Howard marks VI are missing out the tendency to compare against others the influence of the crowd and the dream of the sure thing these factors are near Universal thus they have a profound Collective impact on most investors in most markets this is especially true at the market extremes the result is mistakes frequent widespread recurring expensive mistakes and that&#39;s what we aim to avoid like Buffett said rule number one is don&#39;t lose money rule number two don&#39;t forget rule number one so you know these highflying silver shiny things have their day in the sun until they don&#39;t uh and then you know these guys just disappear and you know you hear from back from some of them 20 years later and no one reads their bios to realize they blew up in the tech wreck uh massively and they came back but you know the memory is short and people just you know they they come back they&#39;re like cockroaches they never really go away so uh individuals

about B boing to lay off hundreds in Washington state as companywide Cuts continue I think many of those will be the people that were striking and uh that&#39;s the way it goes um but they&#39;re going to take those costs out one way or another if everyone else wants a bigger raise than the market then they will just cut back on the people that they need China&#39;s poet borrow mentioned these two words for the first time in more than a decade stock sword and those two words uh were it was I think loose loose monetary policy let&#39;s see but met more proactive fiscal policies and moderately loose monetary policiy which uh moderately loose regard to Central Bank policy in 2011 so this is a big deal and you can go back and see what the stocks did ant group gets new CEO as

to slow that down so just keep that all in mind Doge plans to cut 500 billion from over 1,200 programs just 24 make up the most of it that&#39;s deflationary so for those of you thinking about deficits thinking about uh all that stuff yields blowing out think again China has a lot of room to raise the fiscal deficit jinha said so we&#39;re lowering our deficit lowering fiscal spend lowering growth they are raising their fiscal deficit raising fiscal stimulus raising growth and no one&#39;s paying attention Intel adds some much needed help to its board with stock on track for its worst year ever that is what it is but look you know we love buying at a tangible book we love owning it in the 20s we&#39;ll take a look in the 40s after you know after the Legacy business is fully valued and then um determine what they&#39;re doing with the foundaries and what they&#39;re doing with AI I think that there&#39;s going to be a reason to hold it after it&#39;s in the&#39; 40s but we&#39;ll we&#39;ll keep an open mind Disney boost dividend 33% after achieving streaming profit that was a key part of our original thesis when you couldn&#39;t give it away in the 70s and 80s uh now

gentlemen early August what happened the market got completely shellacked mag 7 in particular as the carry trade on wound when Japanese inflation started ticking up and the Central Bank started hiking rates well they&#39;re going to be back to it maybe as soon as this month and you can I can tell you very simply the higher the Japanese bond yield goes the lower mag 7 is going to go because when they&#39;re borrowing and doing the carry trade it&#39;s all going into high-risk us uh it&#39;s play on currency it&#39;s a play on free money it&#39;s a play on speculation and when that unwinds it unwinds hard and that&#39;s when the 493 become the flight to safety that&#39;s when these guys get smoked money comes out of Japan money comes out of Mag 7 it&#39;s just getting started 10cent boss

a single dog it reminds me a bit of global global Crossing or world I totally understand his View and I&#39;m sure a lot of people out there feel the same way here&#39;s what I had to say in response which I think some of you will find helpful quote I think GE in 2018 is a better analogy of a mismanaged hard- tokill business that eventually turned around under the right management Worldcom was a fraud and Global Crossing was speculating on the future so here&#39;s where uh ge was down um 80 something per in 2018 you couldn&#39;t give the stock away uh and these were the headlines why General uh electric plunged 56% in 2018 the fall of a blue chip this is when they got kicked out of the Dow hint wink wink just like Intel just did wink wink uh by the way what happened next the stock was up 8X over the next two years uh 700% ge warns of Bleak 2019 but promises a brighter future GE has tumbled 25% in 2018 it&#39;s still too expensive GE looks like the most expensive stock in it SE in its sector on a free cash flow basis argues JP Morgan etc etc so same same thing repeated over and over people just don&#39;t get it until they do and then guess what now it&#39;s up 8X everyone wants GE once again but what happened at the bottom here they changed CEOs and they got a guy named Larry kulp who changed changed the business same thing happened with VF Corp same thing happened with uh Advanced Auto Part same thing happened with Boeing same thing happened across our portfolio every single one and it&#39;s all working and the same EXA exact thing is going to happen with Intel same thing happened with Disney you got Iger back so it just repeats over and over you got to be along around long enough biotech got to be got to be in it to win it that&#39;s going to be a big theme in 2025 and uh earnings growth here top 30 stocks last 60 days down 1.69 that&#39;s not the deal the deal is deals in drugs deregulation Pharma companies record cash um they need to get Innovation a lot of drugs coming off a patent they&#39;re going to have to make it up and that&#39;s how they&#39;re going to do it if you look at the other ETF which is the equal weight xbi which is what we&#39;re in plus 138% over the last 60 plus 1.38% top 30 weights over the last 60 days earnings estimates uh have come up and now they&#39;re flat 275 up 13 14% next year that&#39;s a good thing uh data you had a spike in jobless uh in continuing claims were up and in initial jobless claims so that forces the fed&#39;s hand to follow through\n\nGeneral Electric plunged 56% in 2018. The stock was up 8X over the next two years, 700%. GE warns of Bleak 2019 but promises a brighter future. GE has tumbled 25% in 2018, it's still too expensive. GE looks like the most expensive stock in its sector on a free cash flow basis argues JP Morgan. They changed CEOs and they got a guy named Larry kulp who changed changed the business. Same thing happened with VF Corp, Advanced Auto Part, Boeing, Intel, and Disney. Biotech is going to be a big theme in 2025. Pharma companies record cash and need to get Innovation as a lot of drugs are coming off a patent. The equal weight xbi is plus 138% over the last 60 days. Data showed a spike in jobless claims, forcing the fed's hand to follow through.\n### MISCELLANEOUS\nstick around for some ask me anything\n\n### ASK_ME_ANYTHING_QA\nquestions\n\n### ASK_ME_ANYTHING_QA\n\na lot of you get Great Value so let&#39;s get started and um okay first question comes from Kyle m is is there any indication that a December cut will be enough to get money market assets back into equities you had previously shared analysis that they usually Peak within 6 months of the First Rate cut but that could be expedited if Cuts were heavier now 100 basis points in 3 months you think CCI is well position at these levels with a 6.3% yield to benefit from that change if and when it occurs any updates on CCI in general it&#39;s been a while since we covered in depth uh yeah I had it to cover in one of my public appearances but we ran out of time uh I&#39;m a buyer here I love it this all this is is bonds sold off after the Trump election uh CCI is a buy no question about it you want to lock that in as yields compress all these interest rate sensitive reats will go up and we think it&#39;s one of the highest quality ones in the bunch so it is a screaming buy for us at these levels new money coming in would get exposure all day long for that um next Robert Evans asks thoughts on carparts.com stock huh car parts oh that&#39;s interesting just must be a tiny company what is that ticket P RTS negative free cash flow stable revenues margins compressing what does the balance sheet look like current libraries for balance sheet looks okay wanted understand why they have a consistent negative return on Capital why is this such a crappy business um all right 300 600 what did they let&#39;s see what they did to the share count yeah they&#39;ve doubled the share count since 2018 I hate that I literally can&#39;t nothing angers me more than management that does that Soh I think I think it&#39;s probably going to work as a trade to be honest with you uh I just hate management that are like that so for me it&#39;s probably a pass but I think you&#39;re absolutely right as a trade and um I got to learn more about the business but it&#39;s definitely worth digging into but I I would not place a long-term substantial bet with any management that disrespects equity and ownership in that way uh Matt Mitchell hope you and your family are enjoying the Cali lifestyle was wondering if you&#39;ve taken a look at Monclair MC I&#39;m guessing it isn&#39;t quite beat down enough and overlaps with your baba and Goose positions however seems like a high quality business training and Regional valuation for long-term investor uh Sher shance was to acquire another luxury clothing brand Stone Island thanks for your work as always I&#39;ve been on board since the Wells Fargo and Exon Mobile days guys go look at those charts my God holy cow that brings back memories this was in the middle of the pandemic when oil went negative go back to the tapes we were pounding the hell out of Wells Fargo uh we didn&#39;t get it down at 18 I think our basis was 25 and change we bought some at like 23 some at 27 and it was the quickest double I mean it was just unbelievable and then and this was a scary time but I was like guys it it it only traded down this below Book value uh this low in in the early 90s and in 2008 we got to load the boat and then the second one that was such an incredible Year by the way and then the second one was uh Exxon Mobile my God buying this thing down at $30 we didn&#39;t get the 23s but we got the low 30s and this thing just doubled so quickly and then we took them off in late 2021 when and then like all the people that hated energy down there um and it just went up they couldn&#39;t get enough up here and it&#39;s done basically nothing for three years every and and for 2022 and 23 everyone&#39;s like energy energy and energy none of them were here down here and um my goodness well thanks for bringing that up Matt that was awesome and let&#39;s try Monclair MC all right wow this does look like a pretty good business [Laughter] all right hit me up again when it goes to 45 or 40 and we&#39;re probably going to be very interested I just think this has got to fall a little bit more I&#39;m not sure why but um looks like the margins are holding up let me just take a look here yeah this looks like a pretty good business my friend uh y balance sheet yeah this is pretty nice so far I mean this means like it&#39;s worth starting to to look at yeah I mean it&#39;s interesting yeah I like it it&#39;s European based so good job M NC Daniel Hussein next tracker NXT all right it&#39;s down 50% what do they do problem with this is there not going to be enough data for me to go back far enough and feel comfortable all right so this is interesting what the hell do these guys do for business solar tracker and software solutions for util utility scaled solar o this is interesting cuz like I keep looking at green stuff which did a lot better under Trump than it did under Biden and I&#39;ve been looking for one if you can show me a decent balance sheet you got my attention my man [Music] and yeah I&#39;m getting interested lot of air dilution I&#39;m not loving this uh at all so I just want to understand that I like this I&#39;m going to take a look at it I think it&#39;s interesting I&#39;ll probably do nothing with it but nice work Daniel Lucas Mueller recently had a look at Samsung SDI quite interesting situation where China dominates 50% of the market supply for battery Samsung SDI and some other Korean players seem to be the only insurance for the West if China becomes a warmonger blah blah blah nicely down fundamentals don&#39;t look that horrible government subsidy train in dependence from China care to have a look all right so we&#39;re not going to pull it up there Samsung SDI oh I mean this thing is just burning cash like it&#39;s going out of style uh yeah probably pass on this one honestly if you want to look at South Korea look at coupang I keep looking at it and doing nothing the Amazon of uh I got enough Amazon of I got Amazon of China I don&#39;t need Amazon of Korea but if I didn&#39;t have Amazon China I would be looking at um Amazon of Korea which is coupang but it&#39;s a little rich but it&#39;s also interesting so for this I&#39;m going to pass but uh good luck there we go we got that back all right uh Toma Fisher thoughts on Match group we&#39;ve covered this a million times the revenues aren&#39;t growing it&#39;s okay um I don&#39;t know how young people date anymore I think this thing is kind of tired and dead I could be wrong I think they do Tinder or Hive or something look it&#39;s generating a ton of cash this is okay this is must be why I keep looking at it so why the hell is Barry Diller not doing anything with this like he&#39;s asleep at the wheel he&#39;s just not doing anything he&#39;s checked out after building an incredible business the guy just took a nap um I got to learn this business because I keep seeing what you&#39;re seeing and I want to get involved and then I look at the business and I don&#39;t get involved so um yeah all I can say about this is you got to get on like eight conference calls start to listen to what have they promised they would do to turn it around and what have they actually delivered on and why can&#39;t this thing is there some seller like I mean this thing looks great I mean this thing looks like a China stock the fundamentals are doing great and the stock won&#39;t go up to save its life so help me understand why all right so they had a lot of share issue in I&#39;m not thrilled about that but now they&#39;ve reversed it so that&#39;s good it might be ready I mean cash flow is hanging in there they&#39;re bringing the share c c count back down after being pigs and um I&#39;m going to look at it like a 50th time and maybe actually do something so good job on that Toma uh JT investor Tom your media presence seems to have grown significantly over the last few years and your presentation skills are very impressive can you thank you very much can you share some insights on how you refine your presentation skills things you do to prepare for presentations and any other tips lessons learned over the years as you clear your master your pictures have great ability to convey excitement conviction that is genuine and creates positive engagement with your audience any recommendations on books training resources would be appreciated thank you and keep up the great work uh one thank you very grateful for that commentary uh two I just you know if you love what you do it comes through this is what I love to do okay I love family I love doing this and I love playing golf I haven&#39;t played much golf lately but I did just join the local Club so markets close at 1: p.m. out here which is pretty awesome um so I&#39;ll uh I&#39;ll get that going and I got to get my goal by the way um you know going here to get to a single- digit handicap I don&#39;t think I&#39;m going to get it done before the end of the year but um moving in the right direction it&#39;s amazing there&#39;s this Golf Tech one block away from my apartment in New York city so I take lessons when I&#39;m in the city 10 days a month and then I uh and then I can play out here all year round so so I&#39;ll get there what does that have to do with your question um I don&#39;t think there&#39;s anything you can do other than love what you do and do it 247 so you&#39;re not you&#39;re preparing yeah but your preparation is just what you do in the normal course of business every single day like I mean look at my daily reads if if all you did was read my daily reads every day for a year you would know more than 90% of the people in the market um and that takes a long time so you know that&#39;s two three hours every single morning uh make it look easy uh sometimes I&#39;m doing that from an airport lounge sometimes I&#39;m doing it the night before because I got to be up at 5:00 in the morning or 4:30 now now I&#39;m up every morning at 4:30 because I&#39;m on the east on the west coast but um you know they have clubs called uh Toast Masters I guess that could help you with public speaking if you&#39;re not a good public speaker uh I went for like two classes one time when I was young I found it boring and I never went back so I just I just love what I do I mean if you ask me to speak about nuclear physics and like you know read a book and give a presentation on it I wouldn&#39;t be a good presenter because I&#39;m not interested so uh just find something that you love and it will come through and you&#39;ll attract a a group of people like-minded people and live a happy life uh David big fan of your show from the UK could you please have a look at OCTA thanks and happy Christmas Christmas Happy Christmas to you Oka yeah you know a lot of these Co Darlings that have crashed are now getting interested like PayPal which you know it&#39;s it&#39;s moving and grooving no one&#39;s paying attention OCTA might be another one I have to understand that business but I I&#39;ve been looking at it and we&#39;ll probably do nothing but I think that one&#39;s going to probably work let me just confirm that with the numbers yeah yeah I got I got to figure this one out you know the key is it&#39;s like what are you going to sell what are you going to replace it with so there are just huge opportunities identity partner in the US manage secure identities such as single sign on access applications in the cloud da d da all right so I just want to understand how they can&#39;t get disrupted and if I can get to that with these numbers I&#39;m in but um that that&#39;s where the work begins and I think that let&#39;s just take a look here sure the balance sheet is great yes let&#39;s talk about cash flow great why does it have such low return on invested Capital over time I want to understand that this is definitely worth a look so I probably not going to do anything with it but I think you&#39;re on the right track David Max Moore asml I like monopolies um yeah they&#39;re hit on China and all this stuff and us and blah blah blah uh I&#39;d like to see it come down more I keep looking at this it&#39;s on my watch list but I&#39;m probably going to miss it if this I should put like a alarm at 600 and if it gets to 600 really do some work on it and get involved but uh not yet for me Kyle Johnson thanks for all the value you provide you&#39;re welcome I came across the company Janice International Group their businesses all around instilling maintaining storage unit doors and other systems rise run commercial real estate expectations lower interest rates caus the stock to drop 50% IPO 3 years old all right Janice International let&#39;s take a look I thought you were going to talk about the asset manager but that&#39;s Janice Henderson jbi man we got some smart people tuning into this every week I&#39;m super excited you guys are learning and earning and contributing and sharing with your friends and family to grow the thing so cash flows down stocks down a lot more um yeah so it was a growth story now it&#39;s not what are they doing to equity they&#39;re deluding the hell out of people probably for an acquisition or something else um nice cast from operations free cash flow okay balance sheet balance Sheet&#39;s a little bit levered yeah I I think you just got to get comfortable with um how are they going to re accelerate earnings Kyler and what the competitive landscape is like do some Channel checks find out who they compete with talk to their competitors and you&#39;ll learn a lot about them but I think I think that&#39;s worth a look it&#39;s worth doing some work on Eric Haney thoughts on tax loss harvesting Baba into something like kweb started buy Baba uh nothing on margin uh I&#39;d hold out I I I seriously I think there are too many outs for for me it&#39;s uh it&#39;s an absolute no-brainer so I I wouldn&#39;t want to do that personally so you could do it I just don&#39;t think K web&#39;s going to do as well as Alibaba and that should be the case it&#39;s not because there&#39;s anything good or bad about kweb I think K web&#39;s fantastic and I think it&#39;s a diversified way if you haven&#39;t done the work on Alibaba to have the same level conviction that I have you should own K web instead so that might be the right trade for you depends what your tax losses are if you&#39;ve averaged down you know you&#39;d have to do a first in last out type of thing but um if you&#39;ve been paying attention you probably have a basis in the 880s in which case then you should be just sitting tight and waiting to make a lot of money in our opinion uh toen G thank you for all you do longtime listener can you please take a look at rprx royalty Pharma pipelines worth over a billion buying back shares yeah these are special situations um and yes I know you&#39;ve been listening for a long time I appreciate that and I appreciate your support to him uh rprx I don&#39;t love these I really I don&#39;t love these royalty plays I&#39;ve seen too many through the years I mean yeah I get what you&#39;re talking about geez yeah it&#39;s just the market never gives them their full intrinsic value there&#39;s always an overhang that&#39;s what that&#39;s what bothers me about this but she reminds me of vector Group which was a stub on uh cigarette companies made a ton of money but the same guy also got bagged in Borders Books um there yeah share count okay six billion of debt on a royalty business 600 million of cash two billion gosh almighty yeah I get it I get it you just have to understand all the individual royalties which is going to take a lot of work but um certainly on the right track to him I think worth of Lu nice work Richard Lou ignore my question on Pags and stone you answered it last week can I ask you what&#39;s your favorite data to look at to see new car sales I look at Cox Automotive all right Christian Bala Chris Chris chrisan Bala thank you very much for your weekly insights into the market and showing us uh us value investors interesting opportunities what do you think of Polytech holding ticker PYT uh they manufacture parts for the automobile industry okay PYT that&#39;s not it Polytech p o l y t e c p o l y t e c no it&#39;s not showing up there so know how to get rid of this guy all right want that don&#39;t want that zero all right let&#39;s see if we can get this going here [Music] and okay thank God all right we got rid of that P YT p okay Polytech holding Plastic Solutions for passenger cars and commercial lightweight Vehicles separators huh financial analysis low quality business over time let&#39;s see what&#39;s happening with free cash flow okay balance sheet share count I would say that if I didn&#39;t own Cooper standard I would look at it more carefully yeah same thing peak in 2027 I mean it&#39;s basically the same as Cooper standard I just like and Trust Cooper standard management more I know them and uh but this is definitely interesting for sure there&#39;s a ton in the auto space that I keep looking at that um have tremend all right TJ vandermeir hi Tom what&#39;s your opinion on GN store Nord Danish company special hearing aids and audio devices Revenue decline uh market leader turn around plan and place low price all right let&#39;s see GN okay H man this is probably the best AMA we&#39;ve ever had in five plus years that is pretty amazing little bit of dilution I don&#39;t like but other than that looks like a really solid business I&#39;m interested good work uh now you got to just understand what the competition is why the revenues are declining and what&#39;s happening with share but uh all right here&#39;s another K1 GTX I&#39;m sure it&#39;s probably also good Garrett motion flat revenues what&#39;s happening to what is going on with the share count this is weird these numbers are probably wrong yeah so they&#39;ve got solvency risk $1.5 billion of debt $96 million of cash so that&#39;s what you got to get comfortable with is the maturities and the business and the competition but I think there are ways for it to get solved but uh it&#39;s not a guarantee Linda Nickerson wondering about the last video about Emerging Markets which stocks would he recommend uh we only own um Alibaba directly and then some indirect plays like Estee louder and a tiny position in Goose uh longtime Watcher your show like to pitch Swatch group watchmaker Harry Winston Omega blah blah blah SE Master no debt blah blah blah market cap uh Hayek family I bought another 35 million all right well interesting s SW a t c h negative free cash flow so yeah look they&#39;re just turning negative free cash flow you have to understand the turn around plan I don&#39;t think there&#39;s a lot more to talk about here right now it&#39;s a no touch until I can understand the turnaround plan but definitely keep it on the radar Jimmy Jones could you explain decide of a stock is dead money or an opportunity cost even if fundamentals are still the same when you move on that situation we&#39;ve covered this in the past we apply the same framework some go super fast some go super slow but they all work when you buy good quality businesses below intrinsic value and you take solvency risk you

first get right\n\nheadlines  for one in a half straight years in 15 and 16 and then all of a sudden straight up okay BABA straight up um emerging markets do I have that chart anyway it you know what it does it goes straight up watch let me pull that up here same thing collapses after he gets elected bounces around turn of the calendar inauguration merging markets doubles in a year so you know ignore history at your own Peril listen to all the people chasing the shiny objects and uh good luck with that China PPI starting to turn back up\n### MACRO_DATA_SLIDES\nhere is  the global um easing cycle that we talked about here&#39;s the price to book on tax so a little bit of contradictory stuff but I I think what it is is I&#39;m bullish under the surface in xus I&#39;m neutral on the things that have already run I think they do okay I think they underperform and then you look at some of these indicators they&#39;re not anywhere near extreme so we&#39;re not at Euphoria which is like climbing the wall of worry pushing that $7 trillion money market money back in BuyBacks are still going uh cut came down a little bit in the last few weeks who holds the US debt this is kind of interesting everyone&#39;s worried about China selling off the debt they own 2% of our debt so Federal Reserve owns 15% mutual funds own 11% depository institutions that got whacked because of Powell forced them to buy it all in 2021 and he pulled out the rug from underneath them they all had the mark to Market state and local governments 5% Pension funds 3% insurance companies 1% US savings bonds 177% of us treasuries Japan 3% China 2% UK 2% other countries 15% % so UK owns as much us treasuries as China does that&#39;s mind-boggling when you think about it us small business optimism has gone parabolic just like it did when right after the 2016 election guys history doesn&#39;t repeat but it Rhymes over and over we have these type of things if you just pay attention us small business optimism Soares to threeyear high after Trump win shows from drick Once a bull market gets 2 years old there could be a lot left and it shows the history and kind of where we are right now is this little red line so yeah you could get some consolidation here but there&#39;s a tendency for these things to go I think we&#39;re halfway through the secular bull last 18 years we broke out in uh 2014 we&#39;re 10 years in we probably have another 8 years is basically where I&#39;m at and if you look at demographics fits in pretty nicely\n### HEADLINES_AND_NEWS\nNovember was huge for stocks big winner with small caps Russell up 10.9% last month lower taxes stronger economy 22 other times the Russell gained double digits in a month 6 months later it&#39;s been a higher 90% of the time a year later uh up at 15% on average Brazil&#39;s president Lula D Silva recovering after emergency brain surgery consensus expects 96% of companies to grow EPS year onye by 4q 2025 huge earnings breath which means the 493 are back in the game they&#39;ve been left for dead and they it&#39;s their time to shine in the sun\n\nwhen you&#39;re buying I mean look the best lesson I can give you ladies and gentlemen is when you&#39;re buying the companies that we&#39;re buying on balance over time cash flow and revenues go like this and price goes like this around the free cash flow intrinsic value and what we try to do is we just buy when price is down here even though cash flow really hasn&#39;t changed and revenue really hasn&#39;t changed it&#39;s just slowly growing up on Trend over 10 20 30 40 years the longer the better for us so we can see how it acts through cycles and then we get just get Mr Market despondency uh for accumulation and Mr Market Euphoria for distribution that is that&#39;s our model right there it&#39;s not rocket science that&#39;s that&#39;s all we do so um Howard marks VI are missing out the tendency to compare against others the influence of the crowd and the dream of the sure thing these factors are near Universal thus they have a profound Collective impact on most investors in most markets this is especially true at the market extremes the result is mistakes frequent widespread recurring expensive mistakes and that&#39;s what we aim to avoid like Buffett said rule number one is don&#39;t lose money rule number two don&#39;t forget rule number one so you know these highflying silver shiny things have their day in the sun until they don&#39;t uh and then you know these guys just disappear and you know you hear from back from some of them 20 years later and no one reads their bios to realize they blew up in the tech wreck uh massively and they came back but you know the memory is short and people just you know they they come back they&#39;re like cockroaches they never really go away so uh individuals who cannot Master their emotions are ill suited to profit from the investment process that&#39;s Ben Graham clar Seth claran typically we make money when we buy things we count the profits later but we know we have captured them when we buy the bargain and\nfinally  uh from Benjamin Graham a great company is not a great investment if you pay too much for the stock that is the name of the game uh Prof probabilities of a cut next week are 96% new Traders are betting on a quarter point rate cut next week U us CPI brings no surprises firming up Fed rate cut bets ### HEADLINES_AND_NEWS\nBoeing stock is taking off\n\nthe fate of markets rests on Trump&#39;s dollar policy it&#39;s going lower ladies and gentlemen he&#39;s told you what he&#39;s going to do and that&#39;s what&#39;s going to happen China&#39;s Yuan likely to stabilize and strengthen Central Bank says after they devalued it against uh their early salvos with negotiating with Trump this is from Ryan Dietrich now the Bears are apologizing so you had Mike Wilson who got blown out and then you had another Perma bear who wrote an apology to people I&#39;m sorry I&#39;ve been so bearish for the last 3 years and you missed you know 100 plus perc and and uh yada y y and then I see the guy in the next day on TV and he&#39;s bearish again so you know it&#39;s just it&#39;s just genetics ladies and gentlemen uh Boeing restarts 737 Max production a month after the strike ended so the strike&#39;s fixed the max 737 is fixed Kelly ortberg&#39;s in the seat what else do you want to think about ladies and gentlemen and 10year backlog here&#39;s why Disney is doubling down on cruises with a 12 billion doll spending spree because it&#39;s got a high high return on Capital much higher than its weighted average cost of capital why nothing else to think about B boing to lay off hundreds in Washington state as companywide Cuts continue I think many of those will be the people that were striking and uh that&#39;s the way it goes um but they&#39;re going to take those costs out one way or another if everyone else wants a bigger raise than the market then they will just cut back on the people that they need China&#39;s poet borrow mentioned these two words for the first time in more than a decade stock sword and those two words uh were it was I think loose loose monetary policy let&#39;s see but met more proactive fiscal policies and moderately loose monetary policiy which uh moderately loose regard to Central Bank policy in 2011 so this is a big deal and you can go back and see what the stocks did ant group gets new CEO as billionaire founder Jack M talks up AI in rare appearance fact that they own a piece of pretty much every AI startup in China because they give them compute Power Credit in the cloud is something that no one else is talking about it&#39;s going to be one of the greatest value unleashes in the next few years um China&#39;s new monetary policy eo&#39;s 2008 stance we just covered that Chinese Premier vows to do everything possible to expand demand everything possible to expand demand and the Market&#39;s like sh what about Trump what about Trump he&#39;s going to hurt them just like he did in 2017 and 18 when they all tripled Americans cars keep getting older and creakier that&#39;s good news for Advanced Auto Parts that&#39;s good news for Cooper standard why American why investors fear the AI Revolution May face a Napster problem here&#39;s a great article from Charlie gasparino uh you know you can scrape all this stuff but at some point you have to pay for the content and that&#39;s going to slow that down so just keep that all in mind Doge plans to cut 500 billion from over 1,200 programs just 24 make up the most of it that&#39;s deflationary so for those of you thinking about deficits thinking about uh all that stuff yields blowing out think again China has a lot of room to raise the fiscal deficit jinha said so we&#39;re lowering our deficit lowering fiscal spend lowering growth they are raising their fiscal deficit raising fiscal stimulus raising growth and no one&#39;s paying attention Intel adds some much needed help to its board with stock on track for its worst year ever that is what it is but look you know we love buying at a tangible book we love owning it in the 20s we&#39;ll take a look in the 40s after you know after the Legacy business is fully valued and then um determine what they&#39;re doing with the foundaries and what they&#39;re doing with AI I think that there&#39;s going to be a reason to hold it after it&#39;s in the&#39; 40s but we&#39;ll we&#39;ll keep an open mind Disney boost dividend 33% after achieving streaming profit that was a key part of our original thesis when you couldn&#39;t give it away in the 70s and 80s uh now you know knocking on the door of 120 people are starting to pay attention is just getting started why investors need to watch Japan as a key source of Market risk in 2025 very short memory ladies and gentlemen early August what happened the market got completely shellacked mag 7 in particular as the carry trade on wound when Japanese inflation started ticking up and the Central Bank started hiking rates well they&#39;re going to be back to it maybe as soon as this month and you can I can tell you very simply the higher the Japanese bond yield goes the lower mag 7 is going to go because when they&#39;re borrowing and doing the carry trade it&#39;s all going into high-risk us uh it&#39;s play on currency it&#39;s a play on free money it&#39;s a play on speculation and when that unwinds it unwinds hard and that&#39;s when the 493 become the flight to safety that&#39;s when these guys get smoked money comes out of Japan money comes out of Mag 7 it&#39;s just getting started 10cent boss Pony ma Praises China&#39;s Economic Policy stimulus for the private sector uh I don&#39;t know why these aren&#39;t opening here we go muted wholesale inflation rate likely gives fed final go- ahead for Fed rate cuts uh China&#39;s yield discount to treasuries rec covered widest since 2002 we know what happened after that Swiss National Bank tapes leap with 50 basis point interest rate cut Amid Amid Frank strength uh going to see more and more of that ladies and gentlemen Central Bank eing globally China sees needs to increase 2025 fiscal def deficit cut reserve requirement ratio Trump trump send XI xinping an unprecedented invitation to attend the inauguration that is the world&#39;s longest Olive Branch I&#39;ve ever seen Trump has options to mitigate the rising us budget deficit and those options are being led by Vic and Elon a wave of AI pessimism is coming how to outlast it this is a great article from Jenny Johnson talking about what we were talking about last week this is the Ft about the move from training the models where you need all the gpus to inference where you know no longer need as many and then the game changes and then like people you know you&#39;ll get a little negativity and then the story will shift from AI to Quantum Computing and you&#39;ll have a new shiny object just like it shifted from you know data security and then SAS and then it&#39;s just a flavor of the week Wall Street always needs something to sell so uh you&#39;ll see that but this is a trend that will last and it&#39;ll just have a ShakeOut and uh she explains how it&#39;s likely to play out and I think it&#39;s a reasonable assessment how Intel Quantum chips could retransform silicon based Computing so you had the big announcement from Google yesterday with their quantum computer and um all the amazing things that can do and medicine and uh comput computation Etc big breakthrough well Intel is at the Forefront with chips uh calling them quid bits uh and you can read about that and no &#39;s paying attention to Intel and they&#39;re going to be one of the key players in town as that new flavor of the week kicks in and Wall Street starts pounding the table on Quantum Computing and they start to realize oh it&#39;s not Nvidia it&#39;s Intel whoops Central economic work conference release highlights domestic consumption revi Revival Deep dive from uh brandan Ahern over at cran shares kweb ETF and he goes into some detail tell about the announcements Implement more positive and proactive macro policies expand domestic demand stabilize the real estate market promote the continuous recovery of improvement uh look none of this matters till price goes up once price goes up people start to read this and it starts to work China vows bigger fiscal spending to boost consumption next year while we&#39;re doing what we&#39;re reigning it in uh article of the week top 20 25 pick stock market so we went through some of this um biggest surprises next year USD weekend energy stocks underperform Emerging Markets outperform retail stocks underperform bonds get bid yields compress and I would definitely here&#39;s where you can listen to that panel with m m Schneider and Sam stovel was a great panel um uh this is interesting on Intel uh a friend of mine emailed me with some negative\n\n### HEADLINES_AND_NEWS\nheadlines on Intel this week he said quote it&#39;s been a long time since I&#39;ve seen this kind of coverage on a single dog it reminds me a bit of global global Crossing or world I totally understand his View and I&#39;m sure a lot of people out there feel the same way here&#39;s what I had to say in response which I think some of you will find helpful quote I think GE in 2018 is a better analogy of a mismanaged hard- tokill business that eventually turned around under the right management Worldcom was a fraud and Global Crossing was speculating on the future so here&#39;s where uh ge was down um 80 something per in 2018 you couldn&#39;t give the stock away uh and these were the headlines why General uh electric plunged 56% in 2018 the fall of a blue chip this is when they got kicked out of the Dow hint wink wink just like Intel just did wink wink uh by the way what happened next the stock was up 8X over the next two years uh 700% ge warns of Bleak 2019 but promises a brighter future GE has tumbled 25% in 2018 it&#39;s still too expensive GE looks like the most expensive stock in it SE in its sector on a free cash flow basis argues JP Morgan etc etc so same same thing repeated over and over people just don&#39;t get it until they do and then guess what now it&#39;s up 8X everyone wants GE once again but what happened at the bottom here they changed CEOs and they got a guy named Larry kulp who changed changed the business same thing happened with VF Corp same thing happened with uh Advanced Auto Part same thing happened with Boeing same thing happened across our portfolio every single one and it&#39;s all working and the same EXA exact thing is going to happen with Intel same thing happened with Disney you got Iger back so it just repeats over and over you got to be along around long enough biotech got to be got to be in it to win it that&#39;s going to be a big theme in 2025 and uh earnings growth here top 30 stocks last 60 days down 1.69 that&#39;s not the deal the deal is deals in drugs deregulation Pharma companies record cash um they need to get Innovation a lot of drugs coming off a patent they&#39;re going to have to make it up and that&#39;s how they&#39;re going to do it if you look at the other ETF which is the equal weight xbi which is what we&#39;re in plus 138% over the last 60 plus 1.38% top 30 weights over the last 60 days earnings estimates uh have come up and now they&#39;re flat 275 up 13 14% next year that&#39;s a good thing uh data you had a spike in jobless uh in continuing claims were up and in initial jobless claims so that forces the fed&#39;s hand to follow through",

covered that two-year yields yields dropped they they kind of did a dead cap bounce here in the last few days but they&#39;ve been coming down since November as we anticipated bonds get bid in November December and that should follow through in 2025 consumer sentiment is ticking up since the election ### TECHNICAL_CHARTS\num here&#39;s the Nvidia okay so it peaked out at 14074 literally the day before I wrote that article on June 20th and since then we&#39;ve had exactly zero gains first we had an immediate 35% drop so that was pretty nice call and then um we recovered and now we&#39;re back down literally negative this is the hottest stock that people can&#39;t get get enough down at you know wherever it was in the 2020 lows you couldn&#39;t give it away now everybody wants it and that&#39;s why you&#39;re seeing some distribution here the question is what will be the magnitude of this distribution and I think ### MISCELLANEOUS\nrecord inflows for us ETFs so again this this theme I I saw it felt it heard it over the week uh us only don&#39;t touch International you know pile into all these stocks that are trading at 40 times 100 times sales it&#39;s going to be okay they&#39;re going to change the world and all day long talking about Tams the minute people start talking about total addressable markets run the hell out of the room because it&#39;s just code to sell you something that&#39;s trading at 10 20 30 40 50 times sales which on average with the exception of the Zer environment of the 10-year period from you know 2019 to 2022 uh where you actually made money buying stocks trading at 10 times sales and making no money uh every other decade since 1890 you got decimated decimated in the sense that They Carried you out in a Stretcher and you never came back and you joined the military or you went to flipping burgers or driving a taxi uh and I think as rates normalize the people who are buying 20 30 40 50 time sales and losing money or making a little bit money are going to get carried out in a Stretcher so um percentile of s it sentiment indicators you can see here it&#39;s getting frothy and if you look at the things that are moving not dissimilar to 2021 not dis similar to 99 2000 you want to avoid those and even if you get a pullback in those groups uh and you&#39;re buying quality under the surface which has been you know right now we are in tax loss selling Ser season so from December 10th to December 20th you will see uh some weakness in the things that have been weak before the Santa Claus rally and then they&#39;ll start to get bit as we turn the calendar um so just be cognizant of that this is the country composition of the msci world index it&#39;s like us is like 67% of the index and some I don&#39;t know it&#39;s like half of that in terms of global GDP China&#39;s 5% and like 16% of global GDP so this is this is an extreme the rubber band is stretched as far as the rubber band can go and it&#39;s going to reverse back exports from China picked up just after the election so people are frontloading stuff sentiment around the consumer reached the highest level in almost 3 years in Q3 earnings calls uh second half of December has historically been the second strongest period of the year so after the tax loss selling is done in the next handful of days we should see some strength into the end of the year this is Mike zardi since 1978 dividends and reinvested dividends have contributed 69% of the US Stock markets total return helping an $10,000 investment grow o to over 1.6 million 69% were dividends and reinvested dividends so keep that in mind when you got companies like CCI and Stanley Black and&amp; Decker and uh some you know uh great companies like that Disney increasing their dividend by$ 30 3% in the last 64 years there were only six years where dividend levels declined and only one where they fell by more than 5% the only time they fell was 2009 in the early 2000s every other year they increased the dividends so when you get a chance to buy a great company that is down a lot in price and you can lock in an aberrational yield of four five 6 7% with a dividend grower you wind up with these situations like Buffett did with cocacola in 1999 I think he gets like more dividends per year from his Coca-Cola position than his initial basis because not only do you lock in a great yield but the dividend continues to grow and compound over the years and that&#39;s where you wind up with these huge yields with no taxable capital gains you pay dividend income over those years um and and uh that&#39;s pretty pretty exciting dividends have grown an average of 5.7% a year more than uh 2% above the rate of inflation uh this is from Jeff hir over at stock Traders Almanac talking about the seasonal pattern for small caps uh get strong mid December and all the way through March so that benefits companies like Cooper standard like Goose like uh some of the smaller com Comstock resources is off the charts that&#39;s almost a double already as a matter of fact I had a friend emailed me today he said my first two doubles from hedge fund tips with Tom ha uh so I was excited to hear that he had I think his doubles were comto and gener if if he didn&#39;t make gener or he&#39;s just a couple dollars short with gener so that&#39;s exciting uh the second theme okay so what else do we have ah this is the most important chart in my view the backdrop for stock Pickers is the best in 25 years with correlation of stock performance at alltime lows so when did we have this it last you had in 201718 after that big draw down from 1516 and you rallied straight through uh 2020 you also had it in when of course uh the 2003 2005 period when small caps and international took off and you had it in Earnest in 2001 which we&#39;ve covered we cover almost every week comparing it and and the stage set prior to the biggest rally in the shortest amount of time uh from 2002 to 2007 for [Music] um emerging markets and four small cap second theme focus is on Trump&#39;s pledge to make for an easier regulatory backdrop financials manufacturing energy are key Focus points they expect financials could see the biggest impact from deregulatory Stand but also that small and midcap stock should outperform given their higher domestic us exposure especially those exposed to financials and Industrials so us exposure you&#39;re talking small caps and that should be and I think the surprise is going to be at last you know four or five months big rally and then it kind of cools off for a little bit when the honeymoon is over and then we see the policies and the impact and all that stuff this is the long-term price Channel we&#39;ve been riding the bottom for many many years and now we&#39;re working towards the top and that&#39;s how Deutsche Bank gets to this 7, 7100 uh Target over the next year or so uh we shall see opun uh this shows the trough in December tends to be the 15th before rallying into the end of the year so maybe a little more wobble into uh Monday Tuesday and then uh start Santa starts to come to town after the tax loss selling is in the rear viw mirror one-year price expectations for rent rolling over this is good for long-term inflation this argues against the Arthur Burns feere that Powell has lived with for many years of inflation coming back like in the&#39; 70s uh here we go Financial Outlook much better off and then let&#39;s pull up some slomer to see some long-term\n\nthe fate of markets rests on Trump&#39;s dollar policy it&#39;s going lower ladies and gentlemen he&#39;s told you what he&#39;s going to do and that&#39;s what&#39;s going to happen China&#39;s Yuan likely to stabilize and strengthen Central Bank says after they devalued it against uh their early salvos with negotiating with Trump this is from Ryan Dietrich now the Bears are apologizing so you had Mike Wilson who got blown out and then you had another Perma bear who wrote an apology to people I&#39;m sorry I&#39;ve been so bearish for the last 3 years and you missed you know 100 plus perc and and uh yada y y and then I see the guy in the next day on TV and he&#39;s bearish again so you know it&#39;s just it&#39;s just genetics ladies and gentlemen uh Boeing restarts 737 Max production a month after the strike ended so the strike&#39;s fixed the max 737 is fixed Kelly ortberg&#39;s in the seat what else do you want to think about ladies and gentlemen and 10year backlog here&#39;s why Disney is doubling down on cruises with a 12 billion doll spending spree because it&#39;s got a high high return on Capital much higher than its weighted average cost of capital why nothing else to think about B boing to lay off hundreds in Washington state as companywide Cuts continue I think many of those will be the people that were striking and uh that&#39;s the way it goes um but they&#39;re going to take those costs out one way or another if everyone else wants a bigger raise than the market then they will just cut back on the people that they need China&#39;s poet borrow mentioned these two words for the first time in more than a decade stock sword and those two words uh were it was I think loose loose monetary policy let&#39;s see but met more proactive fiscal policies and moderately loose monetary policiy which uh moderately loose regard to Central Bank policy in 2011 so this is a big deal and you can go back and see what the stocks did ant group gets new CEO as billionaire founder Jack M talks up AI in rare appearance fact that they own a piece of pretty much every AI startup in China because they give them compute Power Credit in the cloud is something that no one else is talking about it&#39;s going to be one of the greatest value unleashes in the next few years um China&#39;s new monetary policy eo&#39;s 2008 stance we just covered that Chinese Premier vows to do everything possible to expand demand everything possible to expand demand and the Market&#39;s like sh what about Trump what about Trump he&#39;s going to hurt them just like he did in 2017 and 18 when they all tripled Americans cars keep getting older and creakier that&#39;s good news for Advanced Auto Parts that&#39;s good news for Cooper standard why American why investors fear the AI Revolution May face a Napster problem here&#39;s a great article from Charlie gasparino uh you know you can scrape all this stuff but at some point you have to pay for the content and that&#39;s going to slow that down so just keep that all in mind Doge plans to cut 500 billion from over 1,200 programs just 24 make up the most of it that&#39;s deflationary so for those of you thinking about deficits thinking about uh all that stuff yields blowing out think again China has a lot of room to raise the fiscal deficit jinha said so we&#39;re lowering our deficit lowering fiscal spend lowering growth they are raising their fiscal deficit raising fiscal stimulus raising growth and no one&#39;s paying attention Intel adds some much needed help to its board with stock on track for its worst year ever that is what it is but look you know we love buying at a tangible book we love owning it in the 20s we&#39;ll take a look in the 40s after you know after the Legacy business is fully valued and then um determine what they&#39;re doing with the foundaries and what they&#39;re doing with AI I think that there&#39;s going to be a reason to hold it after it&#39;s in the&#39; 40s but we&#39;ll we&#39;ll keep an open mind Disney boost dividend 33% after achieving streaming profit that was a key part of our original thesis when you couldn&#39;t give it away in the 70s and 80s uh now you know knocking on the door of 120 people are starting to pay attention is just getting started why investors need to watch Japan as a key source of Market risk in 2025 very short memory ladies and gentlemen early August what happened the market got completely shellacked mag 7 in particular as the carry trade on wound when Japanese inflation started ticking up and the Central Bank started hiking rates well they&#39;re going to be back to it maybe as soon as this month and you can I can tell you very simply the higher the Japanese bond yield goes the lower mag 7 is going to go because when they&#39;re borrowing and doing the carry trade it&#39;s all going into high-risk us uh it&#39;s play on currency it&#39;s a play on free money it&#39;s a play on speculation and when that unwinds it unwinds hard and that&#39;s when the 493 become the flight to safety that&#39;s when these guys get smoked money comes out of Japan money comes out of Mag 7 it&#39;s just getting started 10cent boss Pony ma Praises China&#39;s Economic Policy stimulus for the private sector uh I don&#39;t know why these aren&#39;t opening here we go muted wholesale inflation rate likely gives fed final go- ahead for Fed rate cuts uh China&#39;s yield discount to treasuries rec covered widest since 2002 we know what happened after that Swiss National Bank tapes leap with 50 basis point interest rate cut Amid Amid Frank strength uh going to see more and more of that ladies and gentlemen Central Bank eing globally China sees needs to increase 2025 fiscal def deficit cut reserve requirement ratio Trump trump send XI xinping an unprecedented invitation to attend the inauguration that is the world&#39;s longest Olive Branch I&#39;ve ever seen Trump has options to mitigate the rising us budget deficit and those options are being led by Vic and Elon a wave of AI pessimism is coming how to outlast it this is a great article from Jenny Johnson talking about what we were talking about last week this is the Ft about the move from training the models where you need all the gpus to inference where you know no longer need as many and then the game changes and then like people you know you&#39;ll get a little negativity and then the story will shift from AI to Quantum Computing and you&#39;ll have a new shiny object just like it shifted from you know data security and then SAS and then it&#39;s just a flavor of the week Wall Street always needs something to sell so uh you&#39;ll see that but this is a trend that will last and it&#39;ll just have a ShakeOut and uh she explains how it&#39;s likely to play out and I think it&#39;s a reasonable assessment how Intel Quantum chips could retransform silicon based Computing so you had the big announcement from Google yesterday with their quantum computer and um all the amazing things that can do and medicine and uh comput computation Etc big breakthrough well Intel is at the Forefront with chips uh calling them quid bits uh and you can read about that and no &#39;s paying attention to Intel and they&#39;re going to be one of the key players in town as that new flavor of the week kicks in and Wall Street starts pounding the table on Quantum Computing and they start to realize oh it&#39;s not Nvidia it&#39;s Intel whoops Central economic work conference release highlights domestic consumption revi Revival Deep dive from uh brandan Ahern over at cran shares kweb ETF and he goes into some detail tell about the announcements Implement more positive and proactive macro policies expand domestic demand stabilize the real estate market promote the continuous recovery of improvement uh look none of this matters till price goes up once price goes up people start to read this and it starts to work China vows bigger fiscal spending to boost consumption next year while we&#39;re doing what we&#39;re reigning it in uh article of the week top 20 25 pick stock market so we went through some of this um biggest surprises next year USD weekend energy stocks underperform Emerging Markets outperform retail stocks underperform bonds get bid yields compress and I would definitely here&#39;s where you can listen to that panel with m m Schneider and Sam stovel was a great panel um uh this is interesting on Intel uh a friend of mine emailed me with some negative\n\nGeneral Electric plunged 56% in 2018.

    "MEDIA_APPEARANCE_RECAP": "\n\n### MEDIA_APPEARANCE_RECAP\nladies and gentlemen had the pleasure to join Cheryl Kone on the claiming countdown Fox Business this week on Tuesday want to thank Catherine Myers Jake Max to Oppenheimer Brook hak who produced this segment and Liz Clayman for having me on we&#39;re going to listen in here you know and one of the things that you talk about in your research is fiscal and policy wild cards and Tom I want to take that to you because looking ahead to 2025 uh you know you&#39;re saying these are possible surprises the US dollar could weaken after the inauguration and that energy stocks could underperform which I think is interesting and I want to point this out to you uh wolf research put out a note this morning they say that the Trump trade is already running out of steam they say uncertainty in the first half puts a damper on that trade uh so in the meantime they&#39;re focused on the mag 7 how do you respond to that well thanks Sherl I think to tag on what Dutch was talking about his long duration trades I think the biggest surprise of 2025 is going to be that the 10-year treasury gets bid yields compressed what we saw in 2016 after the election treasuries sold off yields went up after the inauguration of trump bonds got bid yields compressed and that&#39;s going to help Dutch&#39;s long long duration trades but we like simpler stocks we like Boeing is a headline today that one&#39;s still down 60% and you can&#39;t give it away but guess what Kelly ortberg is fixing the ship he&#39;s got the union problem solved he&#39;s got the 737 back on the line he&#39;s got a half a trillion dollar backlog over the next 10 years so I think it&#39;s going to surprise surpris people that Boeing continues to climb higher but the work the concern about Boeing though is that about I think it&#39;s correct me if I&#39;m wrong about 60% of the revenue the payment for each plane doesn&#39;t come into the company until they actually deliver the aircraft so that all of this delay has been one of the issues that that hit the stock during the strike you&#39;re not concerned about this backlog they&#39;ve taken out a tremendous amount of cost Cheryl the backlog is solid China is going to double its Fleet by 2043 oh and by the way you can only get planes from two vendors one&#39;s called Boeing one&#39;s called Airbus the stocks down 60% this is one you can tuck away you can sleep well at night and by the way Kelly ortberg is a turnaround specialist at Rockwell Collins in just six years he quadrupled the shareholders money before he sold the company so I think he&#39;s going to do a tremendous job turning things around he&#39;s on the floor in Seattle engineer not a salesperson we&#39;re going to see good things from Boeing in the next two years you can see from the chart Tom that the stock is in recovery mode as to be expected after that strike anded in Dutch I want to go back to you again talk about that fiscal policy question mark As we are now you know whatever 40 days away from from inauguration day um you know you&#39;re talking about those fiscal and policy wild cards Dutch you know I do want to get your take on you know on on federal deficits and stimulus uh because you know Biden is throwing out more student debt payments uh he he made that announcement today so there&#39;s more fiscal SS going in more cost to taxpayers on the other side you&#39;ve got Elon Musk and B ramaswami and they&#39;re focused on $2 trillion in Cuts uh and getting the fiscal House in Washington uh in order uh how do you play that though as an investor as we wait I would say that you know you got to get long this Market okay the Trump trade running out of steam that&#39;s total gar it hasn&#39;t even started yet look at this dream team that he&#39;s put together what happens if we cut government spending rates come down and he&#39;s able to lower the tax rates for individuals to next to nothing this economy we the United States will become the most dominant player like ever on the planet that we&#39;ve ever seen if they just let them do this people will invest money in the markets they will invest in people they will grow their inventories they will grow their businesses again we&#39;re just getting started all right well we shall see I mean certainly there&#39;s a lot of excitement around in particular uh in my mind especially with with dealing with nearly $ 36 trillion dollars in debt that this nation is sitting on can we write the ship and Dutch you&#39;re saying that we can and that would be great for the markets obviously uh Dutch Masters Thomas Hayes guys thank you so much it&#39;s great to see you both today appreciate your time um and we&#39;re back and there we go ladies and gentlemen Boeing is taking off pun intended we&#39;ve been pounding the table loading the boat that&#39;s one of our largest positions just beginning and I explained why then we had the money show appearance in Sarasota this was really incredible this was with Kim uh want to thank Kim gitler Debbie Osborne Mike Larson and Aaron West for having me we&#39;re going to play this 30 second segment nowas investment ideas um it doesn&#39;t you know a lot of people will talk about their picks but his research really goes in depth really tells you the why uh you know what catalysts are for the turnarounds that he identifies and so on so I think you&#39;re going to enjoy his presentation again hedge fund tips with Tom Hayes You&#39;ve seen him on Fox Business uh you&#39;ve seen him on podcast not just my own but his uh he&#39;s specialized again in those finding those undervalued names uh that have a catalyst or multiple catalysts that you know can help with the revaluation really sort of the the Warren Buffett approach to buying undervalued companies so please give a very warm welcome to Tom Hayes of great G so good morning everyone good morning okay has everyone had a great week here a lot of value yeah really want to give a hand to Mike to Debbie to Kim to Aaron all the people that put this together because without them this wouldn&#39;t happen so let&#39;s give them a h so Brian bsky talked a little bit about Jesus when he opened and uh a lot of people when they look to make the right decision they say what would Jesus do I on the other hand When I Look to make the right decision I say what would Warren Buffett do and that&#39;s my framework hands up who thinks Warren Buffett is the greatest investor to ever live I agree and what we&#39;ve heard a lot this week is about a lot of stocks and a lot of opportunities that have gone up a lot already okay and many of those will continue to go up there&#39;s there&#39;s a momentum type of investor and there&#39;s a mean reversion type of investor I&#39;m in the ladder Camp I like to buy opportunities when they&#39;re on sale I say Wall Street is the only place in the world when they throw a clearance sale everyone runs out of the store versus into the store uh so we&#39;re going to talk about a few Bargains and buying Bargains is not for the faint of heart but if you do accurate analysis and in-depth analysis you can get tremendous returns over time with patients with low leverage and following a sensible repeatable framework so a little bit about my backgrounds why you should listen to me or not listen to me uh I&#39;ve been doing this for a long time one and a half decades in the hedge fund business uh predominantly concentrated Equity Longs we do do tactical shorts from time to time when we think the market is overvalued or sector is overvalued or stock is overvalued or we just want to dampen volatility and we don&#39;t want to create tax events for our clients um maybe you see me on Fox Business I do cmbc International I do Yahoo finance Etc and hands up who saw the movie The Big Short well prior to starting my own firm I work for Brad pit okay in that movie his name was Ben Ricket in the movie Ben hocket in real life one of the smartest guys I&#39;ve ever met uh phenomenal experience at uh Cornwall Capital some of the smartest guys in the room they focus on asymmetric bets I can say he&#39;s not quite as handsome in person but he&#39;s much smarter than Brad Pit for sure uh and prior to that I was um at Bedford Oak advisor uh value shop the principal was friends with buff for 40 years so I have the privilege and blessing to travel to Omaha every single year uh some years on gabelli&#39;s private jet which was unbelievable for a young 30-some year old who grew up in New Jersey carrying golf bags at the golf course in the summer uh and Columbia University so that&#39;s some background now um we&#39; covered that we&#39;ve developed a reputation over time of benefiting from sector stock and General market dislocations uh and periods of distress that&#39;s kind of our knitting I got the nickname turnaround Tom because of that the people that have followed me for a long time the people who know me in the industry know I like to run in when people are running out of the crowded movie theater and see how many purses were left on the chairs and those are the opportunities uh to take advantage of as Mike said we have hedge fund tips.com WE Post our weekly podcast there it&#39;s called hedge fun tips with Tom Hayes very hard to remember uh it has become it has toggled between the one and two spot in the hedge fund category for podcast it&#39;s been going for 5 years 268 episodes and um what&#39;s actually happened by mistake is all of our clients have come in through listening to that podcast and the phone calls that I get are I&#39;ve been listening to you for 3 months I&#39;ve been listening to you for 6 months I&#39;ve been listening to you for a year I&#39;ve been listening to you for two years I&#39;ve made a ton of money off your ideas I&#39;m going to send you that money to manage because I&#39;m running a business I&#39;m running a real estate company have a career and um and Etc so uh that&#39;s how we do that and we make our money buying on weakness and selling on strength I know that&#39;s unpopular nowadays uh people like to buy things that are strong and hope that they get stronger and that&#39;s a strategy it&#39;s just two different type of strategies mean reversion is what we do uh momentum counting on inertia is what a lot lot of other people do uh and our confidence to step in when others are bailing is rooted in deep research and the premise that the more price becomes dislocated the more risk has actually come out of the asset versus gone in you know how many people feel like when a stock is falling oh that&#39;s risky I better not get in if the framework is correct and it&#39;s a cash generative company or God forbid the free cash flow is actually growing before the turnaround you&#39;re actually getting less risk as the price comes down and you can build a position over time uh most participants see volatility as increased risk we view it as increased opportunities so while many people look at the 52 we high list for opportunities uh we look at the 52 we low list not that&#39;s not our core place but we always want to pay attention to what sectors are down right now why are they down do they deserve to be down you know there are a lot of things that are cheap for a reason and you don&#39;t want to get caught in that trap either and that&#39;s kind of the the Special Sauce of doing it for so many years you start to figure out okay that sector no matter what happens you know a lot commodity stocks no matter what happens to the commodity they figure out how to lose money all day long a lot of mining stocks Etc um and this is kind of the ethos of our firm and our philosophy great investment opportunities come around when excellent companies are surrounded by unusual circumstances that cause the stock to be Mis appraised so uh some of you want to know where the Market&#39;s going next that&#39;s kind of not what we really do but we did want to put a couple slides up um uh this shows the Dow Jones Industrial Average by year of the decade since 1897 so 120 years of data and what we see on on average is uh like we saw in 2022 that was a down year the second year of the decade TS on average is down and you get some recovery in year three and four like we&#39;ve seen in the last two years and the middle part of the decade has a tendency to be strong now you look at this and say oh then I&#39;m going to go all in we&#39;ve just had this no but you start to say to yourself you look at the presidential cycle tends to be the the uh midterm elections you get a little weakness so I think Jeff hirch said it well yesterday he doesn&#39;t expect any type of material weakness until 2026 uh I think we probably get a little bit of a pullback after the inauguration if passes any prologue people are going to want to hold their stocks till uh through the end of the year but earnings are good and bsky said double digigit earnings growth double digit stock markets I think our base case for next year is somewhere between High single digits maybe 6 7 8 9% for the S&P to potentially low double digits 12% is our base case which implies you&#39;ll have your 5 and 10% normal pullbacks maybe in in the early part of the Year generally after new new president gets in you get the rally into the inauguration and then you get the first four to six months week that&#39;ll just be a time to find opportunity uh big picture here this just those

just like right after Trump got elected in 2027 after the inauguration it took off scenario us Equity sector impact from Mass deportation so the impact uh will be the greatest from uh agriculture construction and Hospitality are hurt the most Capital markets liquidity is just starting to recover this is what you see after troughs we are nowhere near the peak liquidity when you get up to 67% like you did in 2007 2008 and 2021 before you got a selloff um and 2000 before you got the tech wack so we&#39;re just coming off the mat here that&#39;s that&#39;s why there&#39;s a lot of gas in the tank and that&#39;s why we don&#39;t see anything material 10% pullbacks all day long we&#39;re going to get one of those next year for sure um but you know big pullbacks 20% bare markets I think that&#39;s going to be pushed off to late 26 if not 2027 so When the Music&#39;s dancing you got to get up When the Music&#39;s playing you got to get up and dance uh credit spread&#39;s coming down\n\nFederal Reserve owns 15% mutual funds own 11% depository institutions that got whacked because of Powell forced them to buy it all in 2021 and he pulled out the rug from underneath them they all had the mark to Market state and local governments 5% Pension funds 3% insurance companies 1% US savings bonds 177% of us treasuries Japan 3% China 2% UK 2% other countries 15% % so UK owns as much us treasuries as China does that&#39;s mind-boggling when you think about it us small business optimism has gone parabolic just like it did when right after the 2016 election guys history doesn&#39;t repeat but it Rhymes over and over we have these type of things if you just pay attention us small business optimism Soares to threeyear high after Trump win um there you go this shows from drick Once a bull market gets 2 years old there could be a lot left and it shows the history and kind of where we are right now is this little red line so yeah you could get some consolidation here but there&#39;s a tendency for these things to go I think we&#39;re halfway through the secular bull last 18 years we broke out in uh 2014 we&#39;re 10 years in we probably have another 8 years is basically where I&#39;m at and if you look at demographics fits in pretty nicely November was huge for stocks big winner with small caps Russell up 10.9% last month lower taxes stronger economy 22 other times the Russell gained double digits in a month 6 months later it&#39;s been a higher 90% of the time a year later uh up at 15% on average Brazil&#39;s president Lula D Silva recovering after emergency brain surgery um I had no comment on that one all I can say is uh keep an eye on his health because um could be some interesting opportunities coming up in that country consensus expects 96% of companies to grow EPS year onye by 4q 2025 huge earnings breath which means the 493 are back in the game they&#39;ve been left for dead and they it&#39;s their time to shine in the sun\nhere is  in side are buying we covered that this is bearish print except for the fact that they&#39;re always early by many months\n\n### MACRO_DATA_SLIDES\nhere is the hangsang index why am i showing you the hangsang index in 2003 compared to 2024 because this is the last time you saw the shift the China us China to us 10-year yield spread uh the last time that it got this low -200 basis points uh was basically 2001 and then again in 2004 2005 and you can see what happened following this period where you had this spread in yields you had the biggest rally in the shortest amount of time uh in history so all these things are setting up no one's paying attention to it instead they want to buy every stock that's been up you know huge amount triple digits they all want to buy it now and be the bag holders for the people who are buying it in 2022 manufacturing headwind set to ease with the global monetary easing cycle in action now so what you can see\n\nglobal manufacturing PMI has lagged the percentage of central banks easing in easing mode which is now uh looks like it's at uh 70% of central banks are in easing mode you can see PMI always catches up that's manufacturing here bounced off this trend line as we had anticipated everyone said five five five we said counter Trend bounce and it's rolling back over so now we're getting a bounce people are going to start saying five again and they're going to be wrong again um China Golden Dragon index breakout back test rolling back up we're going straight up in 2025 in my humble opinion this is all opinion not advice go to hedge fund tips.com click on terms and forward PE ratio again skewed high due to those seven stocks okay this is interesting from Tom Lee over at fun Strat and what he's basically saying is we're going to have more subdued returns in 2025 and all the gains are going to be front loaded and the second half is going to be weak I'm more in line with the the front half is going to be more subdued and the back half is going to re rally so his rationale for that is he looked at what I'm looking at is the presidential cycle uh after the inauguration you get the excitement into the inauguration you kind of get a little consolidation and weakness after the the and then the back half of the first year is better midterm year is worse uh what he's looking at is just randomly picking all years where you had two years of 20% plus gains and what the pattern looked like and they continued the gains into the first half and then they got weak the second half um you know we buy good companies when they're marked down that's that's what can I tell you uh Mike zakari going for three in a row in 2025 five of the last seven so this is S&P rally 20% each year from 1995 to 1999 why that's an interesting comparison and prior to that was uh the mid-40s and the early 50s is because we just went through that midcycle fed intervention like 1995 which we've been using as an analog for so long so you got to be open-minded that next year could be better than everyone expects but um prepare for the wor you know expect for the expect the best prepare for the worst is is usually good good way to think about it uh investment sentiment is euphoric that you know that doesn't always mean something coming off these big troughs it can continue especially these big Cycles you you bounced right up in 2009 2010 but you still kept going uh it bodess for some consolidation and I'm thinking after the inauguration in February we'll get a little weakness uh but we'll we'll take it as it comes uncertainty and mean reversion Drive gold speculative l uh this is looking like net long managed money on the comx is looking like other previous Peaks going back through 20 2016 you saw 2017 20120 and now I look here's the gold chart we told you up here that we wouldn't be buyers we're kind of agnostic I don't know if it corrects but um I think they're better higher and better uses 2025 year ahead better first half wor second half that's what uh Tom Lee is suggesting political party in control all red Equity return annual going back to 1900 is 7.7% annualized Which is less than people think so that's something to keep in mind that also speaks to probably xus better dollar weak xus equities better we will see I think you know why why you see these type of things is because you see dramatic change setting the platform setting the stage for the next phase of growth so let's see what happens there tax cut to 15% from 21% is estimated to be 4% benefit to the S&P with greatest benefit to Consumer discretionary at 6.8% communication services at 5.1 you know consumer discretionary VF Corp we love it here's Nvidia again no gains since that article in June uh structural underperformance interrupted by multi-year rallies this is the Euro area versus the US this is a downward linear regression line with plus and minus one standard deviation I think that this does Bode quite well for Europe versus us in coming years and um it also look looks to the earnings Trend and when you consider they're going to be easing more aggressively than we are there's something to be said for that catch-up trade selectively where you don't get burned by just taking a basket you pick the best value at the lowest price and you benefit from these mean reversion opportunities it is uh Do or Die day here on the semiconductor index bouncing up against this 5200 day moving average",
    "MACRO_DATA_SLIDES": "\n\nRBC\n### MACRO_DATA_SLIDES\nand it shows you you know for the last 100 some odd years you have 18 to 20 years of consolidation followed by 18 to 20 years of expansion 18 to 20 years of consolidation if you look at the 70s 18 to 20 years of expansion which was 1982 to 2000 uh consolidation and now we&#39;re about halfway through uh expansion so most people think well it must be the time it must be 2000 everyone&#39;s getting excited about paler everyone&#39;s getting excited about Nvidia we must crash I don&#39;t think that&#39;s the case and if you actually overlay demographics over this the commonality between the periods of uh consolidation like 1930 to 1948 1968 to 1982 is demographics and right now we have very favorable demographics as many of you know uh the bulk of our population the echo is 33 34 years old housing formation family formation so we&#39;ve got a lot of gas in this tank and if sler is right uh a lot more upside I know Denny talks about 10,000 on the S&amp;P he&#39;s talking about just based on past Trends as high as 14,000 by the early 2030s okay turn around pick this is as boring as boring gets so if you get excited about CER you are going to fall asleep about Cooper standard and here&#39;s why they make the rubber ceiling that goes around the windows and the doors of automobiles okay who&#39;s excited about that all right so this was $146 stock in 2017 we started building a position for clients in May of 2022 we went public on Fox Business at around 550 and you say okay where where were you in 2022 why do you tell me about it now when the Stock&#39;s up 3x it&#39;s 200% uh about a $15 stock because it&#39;s been der risked and the story is just getting started so what was happening in 2017 is you had a sell through in the United States of about 17.5 million cars okay we fell in this cycle down to 15.3 million if you go back over the last 45 years every cycle uh pee troughs in the low 15 every cycle peaks in the high 17s to low 18 million right now we&#39;re at 15.8 million Sor the operating leverage of this business is such that they&#39;ve taken all the costs out of the business and every few hundred th000 few hundred th000 cars as we go from 158 of the bottom of the cycle to 177 half or 18 uh this business can generate $3 a share in earnings okay when we got involved with this stock you had something terrible called solvency risk okay those are two words you generally don&#39;t want to hear when you&#39;re getting into an investment they had to refinance about a billion dollars worth of debt in Fall of 2022 and Legend over here David kotak who&#39;s one of the best Bond people in the business an absolute Legend over over decades I just had a chance to meet him he&#39;s going to speak next uh tell you in Fall of 2020 was not the best time to refinance high yield debt it was a scary time the markets were closed and uh we got in on the basis that they had more than enough asset coverage that they would get it done one way or another and number one number two there was a lot of private credit swirling around so if they couldn&#39;t get it done on their own uh we could find a way to get them in front of people with credit uh private credit to get it refinanced long story short they got it refinanced Goldman charged them an arm and a leg and three four five legs but they got it done uh refinance risk was off the table and the stock shot off you know $5 $10 it shot up to $20 uh now back to 15 now I&#39;d love to say I&#39;m a genius and I thought of this all by myself but when I was I I asked uh some people asked what is what would Jesus do I asked what would Warren do I also asked what would Charlie do and I copied this idea from Charlie Munger who did the exact same trade in one of the six cycal Auto troughs in 2001 with a little company called tenaco okay who&#39;s heard of Monroe shock absorbers Dynamax exhaust products Etc and here&#39;s the beauty of what Charlie did he read an article in Barons uh about Teno having to refinance about a billion dollar of debt and he put $10 million into the equity and from that 10 million when they got refinanced and the cycle came back he turned the 10 million into 80 million and then he gave the 80 million to a guy named leelu to who started investing in China when no one was interested in China and you turn the 80 million into a half a billion so two chess moves a half a billion dollars who&#39;s interested in that okay so was Charlie buying the things that were already up 10x 20x 30X or was he buying the things that were out of favor that had a catalyst to turn around to take advantage the ladder right so that&#39;s exactly what&#39;s happening right now with Cooper standard we&#39;ve met with management multi mult multiple times we have confidence in their abilities um they also a lot of times when these small cap companies get into trouble they don&#39;t respect Equity so they issue a lot of shares they dilute the shareholders they&#39;ve actually brought the share count down while going through one of the most difficult periods in the Auto industry this is turning up we&#39;ve already tough the operating leverage they&#39;re now at break even they&#39;ve taken $500 million of cost out of the business as you see and the the number one leading indicator of Industry Auto volume for new cars is incentives okay and you&#39;ll see here incentives first off this chart on the top is the global light vehicle production forecast so as you can see this is very conservative right now because people are still pessimistic they expect it to go back to 2017 levels uh by 2028 we think it&#39;s going to happen sooner but on that basis um Cooper standard at that peak level earned $7 a share $719 a share and earnings in 2017 the stock traded at $146 we believe when we get those type of volumes whether it&#39;s 2027 or 2028 based on how the business has been uh better managed they&#39;re going to earn well more than $7 a share they could earn $10 a share and Beyond and the only question is what multiple is going to be applied to the stock a off multiple of 10 times or a peak multiple of 20 times so we think it&#39;s it&#39;s got huge upside even from $15 never mind $5 this will be a 10 to 15 bagg or overtime for us um so that&#39;s that that that&#39;s the incentives you can see going straight up our and if you thought that one was hairy okay I got one that&#39;s even hairier for you it&#39;s called Advanced Auto Parts you guys ever seen an advanced auto parts in your neighborhood okay this is the worst performing Auto retailer of all three Okay so whether you&#39;re talking about O&#39;Reilly etc etc the good news is they probably have the best CEO who&#39;s just come in his name is Shane o Kelly he ran HD Supply in uh for for Home Depot uh $7 billion business he&#39;s got a military background Harvard part business school he knows how to run these businesses and what he&#39;s basically done is he took solvency risk off the table recently by selling the Canadian business that was non- synergistic he created a $1.5 billion doar in cash for that net 1.2 uh paying down debt so he&#39;s brought the leverage ratios down to buy him time for the turn around and then he closed 10% of the stores on the west coast that were all spread out so you see that footprint of all the red dots all of those on the east coast is great where in most markets they&#39;re number one or number two and they have synergies and they have uh opportunity to really generate cash they closed they sold to Canada paid down the balance sheet they closed 700 stores on the west coast that were all spread out and now they&#39;re going to lower the the distribution centers from 38 to13 uh he expects to increase operating margins by 500 basis points over the next few years what that means in English they&#39;re going to generate $600 million in operating income and on that basis the last two three times that they generated $600 million plus of operating income was 2018 2019 and 2022 the stock is currently 45 bucks uh in those instances when they were generating that type of operating income the stock was $186 $182 and $240 I&#39;m not saying that it&#39;s going to go back there but I am saying there&#39;s an enormous opportunity again operating leverage Catalyst it&#39;s been der risked solvency risk has come off the table they sold off non-core assets same same type of story and this is how we can create doubles triples and stuff over a reasonable amount of time be patient build the position and wait good things come to those who wait right um and then\n\n### MACRO_DATA_SLIDES\nlook if you listen carefully to my presentation I alluded to the fact that 99% of the speakers that I saw over those 3 days were talking about things that have already gone up a ton as if they&#39;re the newest best idea ever and none of them or few of them were to be found at the bottom in the hole in Fall of 2022 when we were buying Amazon and Google and made easy doubles so it&#39;s just something to be cognizant of it doesn&#39;t mean it can&#39;t go more it just says some of these valuations on the concentrated magev are stretched as a matter of fact one of the things going to talk about today is the fact that since I posted that article on June 20th uh with Jenson Wong on the on the cover of the article you can go back to hedge fund tips commentary signing that girl&#39;s front area with a marker uh Nvidia has had negative returns since June of this year and you would not guess that based on the continued Euphoria around around the stock okay and um it&#39;s something to be cognizant of so Price to Book Tech bubble Peak it doesn&#39;t mean we&#39;re going to crash or Tech&#39;s going to crash or anything like that I think it does mean they are going to underperform relative to the unmagnify and xus and we&#39;re going to talk about some reasons why this is beauty to my eyes this is the Cox Automotive incentives are booming we jumped up again I think we at 7.6 last time we&#39;re at 8% of sales price sales prices ticked up a hair but they&#39;ve been basically flatlining for the last two plus years incentives are going up what is the number one key indicator of future volumes is incentives and this is exciting especially when we got a 16.5 mil SAR number last month uh when you annualize it out we are moving in the right direction as po per my presentation but this data is new as of today uh annual new stock BuyBacks continue to climb overall distressed rates by property type you&#39;ll see that office is still climbing a little bit retail is leveling off and Self Storage is rolling over as well as industrial rolling over you had a little bit of spike in the summer and that&#39;s come back down 007 Wells Fargo SE the S&amp;P 500 at 7,7 in 2025 highest forecast on Wall Street so again this is stuff that you see all the time opinion follows Trend which um leads me to believe it&#39;s probably overshooting in the short term we&#39;re going to talk about some targets out there uh our base case is 8 to 12% next year maybe a little lower because the index is so impact Ed by the weights of the mag 7 and we think they&#39;re going to perform less well along with the closet indexers and we&#39;ll talk about why it has to do with correlations which are at an all-time low us beige book activity index that&#39;s turning back up uh says economy stable companies more optimistic about 2025 but tariffs a worry what you saw from Trump number one he extended an a long Olive Branch to xiin Ping this week by inviting him to his inauguration number one and number two he&#39;s put people around him that understand that if we destroy China it&#39;s mutually assured destruction and uh certainly we want to extract more tariffs and put America First and at the same time we want to benefit when we can benefit from those areas that we we want to uh get certain Goods at lower cost that are you know we&#39;re unwilling to produce here and uh and there&#39;s a uh beneficial nature to that type of relationship and I&#39;m sure they&#39;ll find their way to the table you know starting at 60% then dropping to 25% then inviting to the inauguration you can see a trend here if you&#39;re paying attention trailing 12- Monon PE ratios I don&#39;t tend to look at a lot of trailing but you can see Tech is above their historical median um you got us m&amp;a at a low just getting ready to tick up that&#39;s not something you see right before recessions what you see is a dramatic acceleration and I think we&#39;re going to start that dramatic acceleration of m&amp;a in the next 12 to 24 months uh which puts the next cycle short-term top out uh probably a couple years from now uh I think the rockiness is more likely in 2026 and a bit in 2020 7 more likely than not than it is in 2025 even though we&#39;ll probably scare a few people early in the year um you see the Chinese uh CSI 300 breaking out back testing trying to move ahead this week I think we&#39;re going to start to see

that is going to be the surp one of the surprises of 2025 it&#39;s going to work like magic just like right after Trump got elected in 2027 after the inauguration it took off scenario us Equity sector impact from Mass deportation so the impact uh will be the greatest from uh agriculture construction and Hospitality are hurt the most Capital markets liquidity is just starting to recover this is what you see after troughs we are nowhere near the peak liquidity when you get up to 67% like you did in 2007 2008 and 2021 before you got a selloff um and 2000 before you got the tech wack so we&#39;re just coming off the mat here that&#39;s that&#39;s why there&#39;s a lot of gas in the tank and that&#39;s why we don&#39;t see anything material 10% pullbacks all day long we&#39;re going to get one of those next year for sure um but you know big pullbacks 20% bare markets I think that&#39;s going to be pushed off to late 26 if not 2027 so When the Music&#39;s dancing you got to get up When the Music&#39;s playing you got to get up and dance uh credit spread&#39;s coming down\n\n correlation of stock performance at alltime lows so when did we have this it last you had in 201718 after that big draw down from 1516 and you rallied straight through uh 2020 you also had it in when of course uh the 2003 2005 period when small caps and international took off and you had it in Earnest in 2001 which we've covered we cover almost every week comparing it and and the stage set prior to the biggest rally in the shortest amount of time uh from 2002 to 2007 for emerging markets and four small cap\n### MACRO_DATA_SLIDES\nsecond theme focus is on Trump's pledge to make for an easier regulatory backdrop financials manufacturing energy are key Focus points they expect financials could see the biggest impact from deregulatory Stand but also that small and midcap stock should outperform given their higher domestic us exposure especially those exposed to financials and Industrials so us exposure you're talking small caps and that should be and I think the surprise is going to be at last you know four or five months big rally and then it kind of cools off for a little bit when the honeymoon is over and then we see the policies and the impact and all that stuff this is the long-term price Channel we've been riding the bottom for many many years and now we're working towards the top and that's how Deutsche Bank gets to this 7, 7100 uh Target over the next year or so uh we shall see opun uh this shows the trough in December tends to be the 15th before rallying into the end of the year so maybe a little more wobble into uh Monday Tuesday and then uh start Santa starts to come to town after the tax loss selling is in the rear viw mirror one-year price expectations for rent rolling over this is good for long-term inflation this argues against the Arthur Burns feere that Powell has lived with for many years of inflation coming back like in the' 70s uh here we go Financial Outlook much better off and then let's pull up some slomer to see some long-term charts from\n\nbenefit in such a big way that when all is said and done with the ability to lower the basis so dramatically I think everyone listening to this now is between the low 80s to the to the mid 80s uh in terms of Baba some of you have kweb and when this thing rips uh we are going to Mint so much money it's unbelievable I mean it's just and we all have bigger positions than we ever could have imagined compliments of xiin ping uh Tokyo Stock Exchange no interest uh uh Hong Kong hangsang index so this is what it looks like ladies and gentlemen it is what we call lower lows higher higher highs and higher lows that is called an uptrend doesn't feel like it everyone's nervous I love it I absolutely love it this game is just getting started and we are excited so you can see these different this is the daily breaking out the downtrend Line This is the weekly just doing this stair step up right before a parabolic move higher uh here's the 10-year yield remember here everyone said five we said no this is a counter Trend rolling over that's exactly what it's doing us uh 10-year uh yield rolling over dollar little fake out above this uh resistance line now rolling back over all in line everything is per playing out perfectly and the temporarily detour is Trump got elected surprised the Chinese a little bit and they did the exact same Playbook that they did in 2016 I don't know like I'm not asking them to read history from like a hundred years like it's amazing how short the memory is this is literally eight years ago and no one remembers they did the exact same thing Trump says I'm going to tar off you the Chinese said no big deal you want to Tar of us 20% we'll devalue the the Yuan by 20% like this is not rocket science and then Trump's like oh wait well then we don't really get any benefit no kidding so then you get to the table and you come up with the deal and everyone's happy and everyone makes money and that's the name of the game and the exact same thing that's happening which is why you saw a little strength into Yan in in the dollar you know the Chinese Trump got elected dollar rallies bonds sell off same thing after the inauguration bonds rally dollar sells off Emerging Markets go up just against what everyone positioned for what everyone expected it's the same thing happening part two um Canadian dollar hang in there loonies even though uh your Governor is not doing a great job governor judau of our 51st state um you know if you can't take a joke uh the the Canadian dollar should start to see some strength uh crude you know bottom end of the range I wouldn't be surprised if this starts to Rally uh what else do we have here gold everyone wanted it up here I think that's going to continue to weaken for some time same story copper I'd be a buyer of copper with China coming back online with stimulus they're going to do quote whatever it takes uh I like that trade China new cycle here we go ladies and gentlemen and uh i' also start to pay pay attention to some of the Staples that got beat down Emerging Markets Healthcare no one wants Healthcare and you know some of the oil stocks I know they're not all going well look we like com stock resources we're just staying we can talk about energy all day long we're just going to stay with comto resources we love it and and uh it's not near intrinsic value yet but it's running there that's for sure um what else by the way here's the sleeper forget about Boeing running what about PayPal back over you know in the $90 from you know you couldn't give it away at 58 everyone wants it at 90 uh here's Alibaba breakout back test here we go ladies and gentlemen uh what is what are these FIB extensions or is this say uh yeah well this is going to be fun ladies and gentlemen all I can tell you I love this ShakeOut back to this moving average and we're starting to bounce back up in fits and starts and um same thing with 10 cent it's the whole group this is going to be the biggest surprise that no one sees coming and they're all going to be stuck in these things and get the rug pulled out while the thing that everyone hates is going to take off and no one's going to figure it out until Baba hits 200 $250 and they're all going to come running and they're going to create our liquidity and we're going to say sold to you sold to you just like in Trading Places with Eddie Murphy and uh Dan akroy and it's just going to be beautiful um regeneron biotech ladies and gentlemen time to buy if you didn't buy at the lows with us uh Now's the Time deals in drugs deregulation the game is on nothing's changed it's just it's happening in price now now we're going to

what I saw in the headline prices down sales up so there's starting to be some activity NASDAQ at the top end of the Ring range so it's either got to break out and build here or come back down to the bottom uh based on some of the valuations and everything else now here's what's important and this is what I've been talking about all year profit growth estimates by sector you could see last year mag 7 started at 50% earnings growth now it's dropped down to 18% whereas all these many of these others were negative earnings growth uh now they are accelerating up to double digits and mid teens and Healthcare which is the most hated sector right now is going to grow 20% next year so uh we've got Baxter we've got uh biotech we've got to Baxter biotech I'm just trying to think if we need to add some more healthc care uh and we'll keep an eye on that Equity positioning across sectors okay materials I think that's the opportunity we've got the album Arrow there com stock resource

while the dollar was collapsing in his first year emerging markets were rallying as well as China Baba same thing turn of the calendar straight up $84 to $187 like you guys can't even like you think

years in 15 and 16 and then all of a sudden straight up okay Baba straight up um emerging markets do I have that chart anyway it you know what it does it goes straight up watch let me pull that up here same thing collapses after he gets elected bounces around turn of the calendar inauguration merging markets doubles in a year so you know ignore history at your own Peril listen to all the people chasing the shiny objects and uh good luck with that uh here we go what does financial success look like for Americans so if you&#39;re in uh J if you&#39;re a boomer wow boomers are pessimistic they think you only need a million bucks if you&#39;re Gen X they think you only need five million gen z uh you need 10 million bucks or a half a million dollars a year salary uh I think that&#39;s right

starting to turn back up\n### MACRO_DATA_SLIDES\nhere is  the global um easing cycle that we talked about here&#39;s the price to book on tax so a little bit of contradictory stuff but I I think what it is is I&#39;m bullish under the surface in xus I&#39;m neutral on the things that have already run I think they do okay I think they underperform and then you look at some of these indicators they&#39;re not anywhere near extreme so we&#39;re not at Euphoria which is like climbing the wall of worry pushing that $7 trillion money market money back in BuyBacks are still going uh cut came down a little bit in the last few weeks who holds the US debt this is kind of interesting everyone&#39;s worried about China selling off the debt they own 2% of our debt so Federal Reserve owns 15% mutual funds own 11% depository institutions that got whacked because of Powell forced them to buy it all in 2021 and he pulled out the rug from underneath them they all had the mark to Market state and local governments 5% Pension funds 3% insurance companies 1% US savings bonds 177% of us treasuries Japan 3% China 2% UK 2% other countries 15% % so UK owns as much us treasuries as China does that&#39;s mind-boggling when you think about it us small business optimism has gone parabolic just like it did when right after the 2016 election guys history doesn&#39;t repeat but it Rhymes over and over we have these type of things if you just pay attention us small business optimism Soares to threeyear high after Trump win shows from drick Once a bull market gets 2 years old there could be a lot left and it shows the history and kind of where we are right now is this little red line so yeah you could get some consolidation here but there&#39;s a tendency for these things to go I think we&#39;re halfway through the secular bull last 18 years we broke out in uh 2014 we&#39;re 10 years in we probably have another 8 years is basically where I&#39;m at and if you look at demographics fits in pretty nicely\n### HEADLINES_AND_NEWS\nNovember was huge for stocks big winner with small caps Russell up 10.9% last month lower taxes stronger economy 22 other times the Russell gained double

showing you the hangsang index in 2003 compared to 2024 because this is the last time you saw the shift the China us China to us 10-year yield spread uh the last time that it got this low -200 basis points uh was basically 2001 and then again in 2004 2005 and you can see what happened following this period where you had this spread in yields you had the biggest rally in the shortest amount of time uh in history so all these things are setting up no one's paying attention to it instead they want to buy every stock that's been up you know huge amount triple digits they all want to buy it now and be the bag holders for the people who are buying it in 2022 manufacturing headwind set to ease with the global monetary easing cycle in action now so what you can see",
    "FEATURED_COMPANY_DEEP_DIVES": "\n\nthe good news is they probably have the best CEO who&#39;s just come in his name is Shane o Kelly he ran HD Supply in uh for for Home Depot uh $7 billion business he&#39;s got a military background Harvard part business school he knows how to run these businesses and what he&#39;s basically done is he took solvency risk off the table recently by selling the Canadian business that was non- synergistic he created a $1.5 billion doar in cash for that net 1.2 uh paying down debt so he&#39;s brought the leverage ratios down to buy him time for the turn around and then he closed 10% of the stores on the west coast that were all spread out so you see that footprint of all the red dots all of those on the east coast is great where in most markets they&#39;re number one or number two and they have synergies and they have uh opportunity to really generate cash they closed they sold to Canada paid down the balance sheet they closed 700 stores on the west coast that were all spread out and now they&#39;re going to lower the the distribution centers from 38 to13 uh he expects to increase operating margins by 500 basis points over the next few years what that means in English they&#39;re going to generate $600 million in operating income and on that basis the last two three times that they generated $600 million plus of operating income was 2018 2019 and 2022 the stock is currently 45 bucks uh in those instances when they were generating that type of operating income the stock was $186 $182 and $240 I&#39;m not saying that it&#39;s going to go back there but I am saying there&#39;s an enormous opportunity again operating leverage Catalyst it&#39;s been der risked solvency risk has come off the table they sold off non-core assets same same type of story and this is how we can create doubles triples and stuff over a reasonable amount of time be patient build the position and wait good things come to those who wait right um and then\n### FEATURED_COMPANY_DEEP_DIVES\nfinally  is Etsy who&#39;s heard of etsy okay so you have two choices in the next three weeks you can go on to Amazon you can scatter shot a bunch of chocolate baskets that&#39;s no one ever going to eat unpersonalized your business clients your family is going to say oh yeah you did the minimum congratulations uh you thought of me barely uh or you can go on to Etsy and get them something beautifully engraved with the most important thing to every single person with their own name on it okay and get a customized thing and they&#39;ve built a tremendous business in doing customized stuff it was a covid darling the stock ran up to over $300 a share it&#39;s now uh we initiate at $49 I think it&#39;s still what is it what is it Jeff $49 55 okay so uh so we&#39;re up on that one barely uh but here&#39;s the name of the game ladies and gentlemen when I talk about a framework looking under the surface and understanding what you buy I think about it in terms of private equity in the public markets what would I pay for the entire business if JP Morgan was going to finance me to buy the whole company and I had to put 100% of my net worth up for the equity of the purchase um look at the free those purple bars are the free cash generation of etsy so does it look like the free cash flow has gone down a whole lot since the stock was trading at $300 okay so if the stock was priced you know Mr Market is a manic depressive and AIC euphoric okay so you&#39;re seeing a little bit of the manic euphorics uh a little bit uh this week and and some of the manic depresses and stock like this but you know when I look at this if you were going to go buy 10 Jersey Mike&#39;s franchises is that Big Dam here at the Subway shop and you know you looked at the guy you would look at the financials by the way I know a lot of people don&#39;t like to look at financials before they buy a stock but if you were going to buy a whole business you would look at the financials right and if the free cash flow the amount back to owners back to you as the purchaser was basically the same over the last 10 years would you try to buy it at 20% of what it was worth a few years ago the guy would literally call security guards and have you escorted out of the building because you were insulting and you were completely irrational except every day in the public markets you get opportunities like this where if you would actually present it to the board I&#39;ll buy the whole company at the price that it&#39;s quoted in the market they would call security and have you think you were a Looney Tune but that happens every day so stock price down 80% free cash flow generation to owners not only about par puru with when it was a $300 stock uh but re accelerating growth they&#39;re turning it around they did make some mistakes but they did keep 92 million users it&#39;s the fourth most trafficed website on for e-commerce site in the US how many of

flow every single year does that sound like they have solvency risk no okay balance sheet is delevered the the free cash flow is growing over the next 5 years they&#39;re going to generate uh about enough cash where you could buy in 60% of the stock they just announced a$1 billion buyback authorization so um you know 1.2 billion of cash on the balance sheet 2.3 billion long-term debt re

you pay values what you get we we think it&#39;s the best opportunity globally they international business to your point Alibaba Express is growing at 30% pindu Duo is a competitor with timu uh I think timu if uh pindu do I believe their numbers are either unsustainable or unreliable and you&#39;re seeing them get shut down in a lot of markets like Vietnam Alibaba does quality business and Alibaba will is the toll taker in China if you believe that the government will continue to do stimulus if you believe that they will recover like they do every cycle just like Autos recover every cycle uh and it&#39;s the cheapest covert play in China because they are the number one cloud provider and what they do is with every AI startup they say don&#39;t worry about it you don&#39;t have to give us money we&#39;ll give you compute power which costs us basically nothing you give us Equity so they&#39;ve got equity in every single startup AI startup in China and that&#39;s given zero value right now on the stock price you&#39;re going to see some of these things be thousand Baggers and we own them indirectly as owners of alib so we that&#39;s a perfect play and it&#39;s one of our largest positions so your spot on we&#39;ll do one more yeah what do you think about super micro at will they get their financial reporting issues taken care of and their future please uh super micro wow um you know that was one when it was going straight up I said what would Jesus do and then I said well Jesus didn&#39;t give me an answer I said okay what would Warren Buffet do and uh and Warren Buffet would in touch him with a 10ft pole so we took a pass as far as as companies that have accounting irregularities that is a huge red flag um obviously there&#39;s substance to their underlying business but when you have that type of thing it&#39;s a don&#39;t touch and and I live my life under a very simple framework I am perfectly comfortable with making errors of omission like I I have no fomo fomo is not in my DNA like if if I see someone make a 100x on something that I wasn&#39;t participant like I&#39;m super happy for them like I don&#39;t think my way is the only way I just figured out after doing it long enough I&#39;m really good at one little thing and this is what I&#39;m good at and I just do that and there are tons of ways to make money so um the short answer to your question is I don&#39;t touch companies that have a history of accounting irregularities it&#39;s just a don&#39;t touch because you know if you see a few cockroaches you don&#39;t know how much damage is underneath the sheetrock and uh and touched it exactly the wrong moment what&#39;s that what if you touched it at exactly it you&#39;re in it and deciding what exactly the wrong moment right before the problem oh okay right before the problem sometimes you got to take your lumps we all do um I would I would I would say two things number one is if you&#39;re going to harvest a loss do you have if you have gains in other stocks that you&#39;re going to be paying tax on next year you might want to harvest that loss and use that use that tax asset against the games now&#39;s a good time to do it before the end of the year uh opinion not advice um but if you&#39;re going to hold on to it you better get on the conference calls and be very darn sure that you feel comfortable that the the error was explainable rational and you feel comfortable in the financials and then again prices what you pay what you get even though it&#39;s fallen down what is the value of it how much you know is it are you comfortable with the current valuation assuming that it&#39;s correct uh but for me I I I run the other way from some of those guys yeah I think that&#39;s it thank you very much and we&#39;re back and then we had a segment uh panel segment which I would strongly encourage you to listen to you can find it on YouTube Just Google hedge fund tips it&#39;s called part two the panel that was with Mish Schneider who you see all the time on Charles P on Fox Business uh great to be on with her and Legend Sam stoval who&#39;s been a market strategist also had dinner with him uh and Jose Torres from interactive brokers at the Scott Walker uh former Scott Walker uh governor of Wisconsin event on Thursday night this was a great segment but we&#39;re not going to take 30 minutes to play it I would encourage you because we go in depth into Emerging Markets China and you might find that very helpful we just have too many amas and stuff to get through today and\n\n###

latter and not the former the transfere rather than the transferer and uh people who talk in these terms are always the transfer s versus the transfer EAS of the wealth because they are impatient and they fall into that it&#39;s a trap it&#39;s this and that but if you apply a good framework across 10 8 10 12 great companies uh you&#39;re going to do great over time and don&#39;t get faked out by the shiny object and the people who think it have has to go super fast um and you&#39;ll be fine any advice uh worth investing ran pack p turning cash flow positive what do these guys do you know there are a lot of these covid companies product Solutions and Aline solutions for e-commerce packaging Solutions blah blah blah h yeah looks like it&#39;s trying to recover here how&#39;s the business doing revenues are starting to recover it seems like management is a tad piggy with Equity don&#39;t like me no like uh uh kind of lower quality business over time cash versus debt little bit little bit levered here this is what you got to worry about and keep your eye on um yeah that&#39;s that&#39;s that&#39;s going to be your big thing if you can get comfortable with solvency risk your recover is probably okay so not bad there manique and let&#39;s see here and then\n### ASK_ME_ANYTHING_QA\nfinally  Landon H looking at bear as a long completed partially setle up Roundup lination still has some settlement items outstanding a lot of Deb uh once Market Clarity on the remaining litigation pay down after debt how would you evaluate this stock I wouldn&#39;t we&#39;ve looked at it a million times on the podcast and we&#39;ve always passed um I don&#39;t really like this one I had confidence in 3M which is why that was that worked great um but we also didn&#39;t stay too long at the table because if you remember we had this Spike up and now it&#39;s back down so you know it we got out and then it shot up to 140 Beyond us now it&#39;s all the way back down to 129 I think this one will actually be okay but like it was such a large move in a short period of time and you still had some uncertainty and you know every now and then you got to book profits so um let&#39;s take a look here B A ye e r why is it not giving me the correct one yeah I just I just don&#39;t have look I think you&#39;re going to be right but you&#39;re basically playing roulette black and red is the litigation over or isn&#39;t the litigation over uh and I I really don&#39;t want to play play that game I could play it with 3m because I understood the rest of the business and I understood I could quantify and I had an estimate range this one I don&#39;t know I think it&#39;ll probably it&#39;s probably worth a gamble you put 1% you know 1% of your portfolio maybe you have a two 3x 4X but um I don&#39;t think you can have any Edge on it and uh for that reason I&#39;m out uh",

covered that two-year yields yields dropped they they kind of did a dead cap bounce here in the last few days but they&#39;ve been coming down since November as we anticipated bonds get bid in November December and that should follow through in 2025 consumer sentiment is ticking up since the election ### TECHNICAL_CHARTS\num here&#39;s the Nvidia okay so it peaked out at 14074 literally the day before I wrote that article on June 20th and since then we&#39;ve had exactly zero gains first we had an immediate 35% drop so that was pretty nice call and then um we recovered and now we&#39;re back down literally negative this is the hottest stock that people can&#39;t get get enough down at you know wherever it was in the 2020 lows you couldn&#39;t give it away now everybody wants it and that&#39;s why you&#39;re seeing some distribution here the question is what will be the magnitude of this distribution and I think ### MISCELLANEOUS\nrecord inflows for us ETFs so again this this theme I I saw it felt it heard it over the week uh us only don&#39;t touch International you know pile into all these stocks that are trading at 40 times 100 times sales it&#39;s going to be okay they&#39;re going to change the world and all day long talking about Tams the minute people start talking about total addressable markets run the hell out of the room because it&#39;s just code to sell you something that&#39;s trading at 10 20 30 40 50 times sales which on average with the exception of the Zer environment of the 10-year period from you know 2019 to 2022 uh where you actually made money buying stocks trading at 10 times sales and making no money uh every other decade since 1890 you got decimated decimated in the sense that They Carried you out in a Stretcher and you never came back and you joined the military or you went to flipping burgers or driving a taxi uh and I think as rates normalize the people who are buying 20 30 40 50 time sales and losing money or making a little bit money are going to get carried out in a Stretcher so um percentile of s it sentiment indicators you can see here it&#39;s getting frothy and if you look at the things that are moving not dissimilar to 2021 not dis similar to 99 2000 you want to avoid those and even if you get a pullback in those groups uh and you&#39;re buying quality under the surface which has been you know right now we are in tax loss selling Ser season so from December 10th to December 20th you will see uh some weakness in the things that have been weak before the Santa Claus rally and then they&#39;ll start to get bit as we turn the calendar um so just be cognizant of that this is the country composition of the msci world index it&#39;s like us is like 67% of the index and some I don&#39;t know it&#39;s like half of that in terms of global GDP China&#39;s 5% and like 16% of global GDP so this is this is an extreme the rubber band is stretched as far as the rubber band can go and it&#39;s going to reverse back exports from China picked up just after the election so people are frontloading stuff sentiment around the consumer reached the highest level in almost 3 years in Q3 earnings calls uh second half of December has historically been the second strongest period of the year so after the tax loss selling is done in the next handful of days we should see some strength into the end of the year this is Mike zardi since 1978 dividends and reinvested dividends have contributed 69% of the US Stock markets total return helping an $10,000 investment grow o to over 1.6 million 69% were dividends and reinvested dividends so keep that in mind when you got companies like CCI and Stanley Black and&amp; Decker and uh some you know uh great companies like that Disney increasing their dividend by$ 30 3% in the last 64 years there were only six years where dividend levels declined and only one where they fell by more than 5% the only time they fell was 2009 in the early 2000s every other year they increased the dividends so when you get a chance to buy a great company that is down a lot in price and you can lock in an aberrational yield of four five 6 7% with a dividend grower you wind up with these situations like Buffett did with cocacola in 1999 I think he gets like more dividends per year from his Coca-Cola position than his initial basis because not only do you lock in a great yield but the dividend continues to grow and compound over the years and that&#39;s where you wind up with these huge yields with no taxable capital gains you pay dividend income over those years um and and uh that&#39;s pretty pretty exciting dividends have grown an average of 5.7% a year more than uh 2% above the rate of inflation uh this is from Jeff hir over at stock Traders Almanac talking about the seasonal pattern for small caps uh get strong mid December and all the way through March so that benefits companies like Cooper standard like Goose like uh some of the smaller com Comstock resources is off the charts that&#39;s almost a double already as a matter of fact I had a friend emailed me today he said my first two doubles from hedge fund tips with Tom ha uh so I was excited to hear that he had I think his doubles were comto and gener if if he didn&#39;t make gener or he&#39;s just a couple dollars short with gener so that&#39;s exciting uh the second theme okay so what else do we have ah this is the most important chart in my view the backdrop for stock Pickers is the best in 25 years with correlation of stock performance at alltime lows so when did we have this it last you had in 201718 after that big draw down from 1516 and you rallied straight through uh 2020 you also had it in when of course uh the 2003 2005 period when small caps and international took off and you had it in Earnest in 2001 which we&#39;ve covered we cover almost every week comparing it and and the stage set prior to the biggest rally in the shortest amount of time uh from 2002 to 2007 for [Music] um emerging markets and four small cap second theme focus is on Trump&#39;s pledge to make for an easier regulatory backdrop financials manufacturing energy are key Focus points they expect financials could see the biggest impact from deregulatory Stand but also that small and midcap stock should outperform given their higher domestic us exposure especially those exposed to financials and Industrials so us exposure you&#39;re talking small caps and that should be and I think the surprise is going to be at last you know four or five months big rally and then it kind of cools off for a little bit when the honeymoon is over and then we see the policies and the impact and all that stuff this is the long-term price Channel we&#39;ve been riding the bottom for many many years and now we&#39;re working towards the top and that&#39;s how Deutsche Bank gets to this 7, 7100 uh Target over the next year or so uh we shall see opun uh this shows the trough in December tends to be the 15th before rallying into the end of the year so maybe a little more wobble into uh Monday Tuesday and then uh start Santa starts to come to town after the tax loss selling is in the rear viw mirror one-year price expectations for rent rolling over this is good for long-term inflation this argues against the Arthur Burns feere that Powell has lived with for many years of inflation coming back like in the&#39;

this trend line as we had anticipated everyone said five five five we said counter Trend bounce and it's rolling back over so now we're getting a bounce people are going to start saying five again and they're going to be wrong again um China Golden Dragon index breakout back test rolling back up we're going straight up in 2025 in my humble opinion this is all opinion not advice go to hedge fund tips.com click on terms and forward PE ratio again skewed high due to those seven stocks okay this is interesting from Tom Lee over at fun Strat and what he's basically saying is we're going to have more subdued returns in 2025 and all the gains are going to be front loaded and the second half is going to be weak I'm more in line with the the front half is going to be more subdued and the back half is going to re rally so his rationale for that is he looked at what I'm looking at is the presidential cycle uh after the inauguration you get the excitement into the inauguration you kind of get a little consolidation and weakness after the the and then the back half of the first year is better midterm year is worse uh what he's looking at is just randomly picking all years where you had two years of 20% plus gains and what the pattern looked like and they continued the gains into the first half and then they got weak the second half um you know we buy good companies when they're marked down that's that's what can I tell you uh Mike zakari going for three in a row in 2025 five of the last seven so this is S&P rally 20% each year from 1995 to 1999 why that's an interesting comparison and prior to that was uh the mid-40s and the early 50s is because we just went through that midcycle fed intervention like 1995 which we've been using as an analog for so long so you got to be open-minded that next year could be better than everyone expects but um prepare for the wor you know expect for the expect the best prepare for the worst is is usually good good way to think about it uh investment sentiment is euphoric that you know that doesn't always mean something coming off these big troughs it can continue especially these big Cycles you you bounced right up in 2009 2010 but you still kept going uh it bodess for some consolidation and I'm thinking after the inauguration in February we'll get a little weakness uh but we'll we'll take it as it comes uncertainty and mean reversion Drive gold speculative l uh this is looking like net long managed money on the comx is looking like other previous Peaks going back through 20 2016 you saw 2017 20120 and now I look here's the gold chart we told you up here that we wouldn't be buyers we're kind of agnostic I don't know if it corrects but um I think they're better higher and better uses 2025 year ahead better first half wor second half that's what uh Tom Lee is suggesting political party in control all red Equity return annual going back to 1900 is 7.7% annualized Which is less than people think so that's something to keep in mind that also speaks to probably xus better dollar weak xus equities better we will see I think you know why why you see these type of things is because you see dramatic change setting the platform setting the stage for the next phase of growth so let's see what happens there tax cut to 15% from 21% is estimated to be 4% benefit to the S&P with greatest benefit to Consumer discretionary at 6.8% communication services at 5.1 you know consumer discretionary VF Corp we love it here's Nvidia again no gains since that article in June uh structural underperformance interrupted by multi-year rallies this is the Euro area versus the US this is a downward linear regression line with plus and minus one standard deviation I think that this does Bode quite well for Europe versus us in coming years and um it also look looks to the earnings Trend and when you consider they're going to be easing more aggressively than we are there's something to be said for that catch-up trade selectively where you don't get burned by just taking a basket you pick the best value at the lowest price and you benefit from these mean reversion opportunities it is uh Do or Die day here on the

    "### QUOTES_OF_THE_WEEK": "\n\nglobal manufacturing PMI has lagged the percentage of central banks easing in easing mode which is now uh looks like it's at uh 70% of central banks are in easing mode you can see PMI always catches up that's manufacturing here bounced off this trend line as we had anticipated everyone said five five five we said counter Trend bounce and it's rolling back over so now we're getting a bounce people are going to start saying five again and they're going to be wrong again um China Golden Dragon index breakout back test rolling back up we're going straight up in 2025 in my humble opinion this is all opinion not advice go to hedge fund tips.com click on terms and forward PE ratio again skewed high due to those seven stocks okay this is interesting from Tom Lee over at fun Strat and what he's basically saying is we're going to have more subdued returns in 2025 and all the gains are going to be front loaded and the second half is going to be weak I'm more in line with the the front half is going to be more subdued and the back half is going to re rally so his rationale for that is he looked at what I'm looking at is the presidential cycle uh after the inauguration you get the excitement into the inauguration you kind of get a little consolidation and weakness after the the and then the back half of the first year is better midterm year is worse uh what he's looking at is just randomly picking all years where you had two years of 20% plus gains and what the pattern looked like and they continued the gains into the first half and then they got weak the second half um you know we buy good companies when they're marked down that's that's what can I tell you uh Mike zakari going for three in a row in 2025 five of the last seven so this is S&P rally 20% each year from 1995 to 1999 why that's an interesting comparison and prior to that was uh the mid-40s and the early 50s is because we just went through that midcycle fed intervention like 1995 which we've been using as an analog for so long so you got to be open-minded that next year could be better than everyone expects but um prepare for the wor you know expect for the expect the best prepare for the worst is is usually good good way to think about it uh investment sentiment is euphoric that you know that doesn't always mean something coming off these big troughs it can continue especially these big Cycles you you bounced right up in 2009 2010 but you still kept going uh it bodess for some consolidation and I'm thinking after the inauguration in February we'll get a little weakness uh but we'll we'll take it as it comes uncertainty and mean reversion Drive gold speculative l uh this is looking like net long managed money on the comx is looking like other previous Peaks going back through 20 2016 you saw 2017 20120 and now I look here's the gold chart we told you up here that we wouldn't be buyers we're kind of agnostic I don't know if it corrects but um I think they're better higher and better uses 2025 year ahead better first half wor second half that's what uh Tom Lee is suggesting political party in control all red Equity return annual going back to 1900 is 7.7% annualized Which is less than people think so that's something to keep in mind that also speaks to probably xus better dollar weak xus equities better we will see I think you know why why you see these type of things is because you see dramatic change setting the platform setting the stage for the next phase of growth so let's see what happens there tax cut to 15% from 21% is estimated to be 4% benefit to the S&P with greatest benefit to Consumer discretionary at 6.8% communication services at 5.1 you know consumer discretionary VF Corp we love it here's Nvidia again no gains since that article in June uh structural underperformance interrupted by multi-year rallies this is the Euro area versus the US this is a downward linear regression line with plus and minus one standard deviation I think that this does Bode quite well for Europe versus us in coming years and um it also look looks to the earnings Trend and when you consider they're going to be easing more aggressively than we are there's something to be said for that catch-up trade selectively where you don't get burned by just taking a basket you pick the best value at the lowest price and you benefit from these mean reversion opportunities it is uh Do or Die day here on the semiconductor index bouncing up against this 5200 day moving average",

      "expansion so most people think well it must be the time it must be 2000 everyone&#39;s getting excited about paler everyone&#39;s getting excited about Nvidia we must crash I don&#39;t think that&#39;s the case and if you actually overlay demographics over this the commonality between the periods of uh consolidation like 1930 to 1948 1968 to 1982 is demographics and right now we have very favorable demographics as many of you know uh the bulk of our population the echo is 33 34 years old housing formation family formation so we&#39;ve got a lot of gas in this tank and if sler is right uh a lot more upside I know Denny talks about 10,000 on the S&amp;P he&#39;s talking about just based on past Trends as high as 14,000 by the early 2030s okay turn around pick this is as boring as boring gets so if you get excited about CER you are going to fall asleep about Cooper standard and here&#39;s why they make the rubber ceiling that goes around the windows and the doors of automobiles okay who&#39;s excited about that all right so this was $146 stock in 2017 we started building a position for clients in May of 2022 we went public on Fox Business at around 550 and you say okay where where were you in 2022 why do you tell me about it now when the Stock&#39;s up 3x it&#39;s 200% uh about a $15 stock because it&#39;s been der risked and the story is just getting started so what was happening in 2017 is you had a sell through in the United States of about 17.5 million cars okay we fell in this cycle down to 15.3 million if you go back over the last 45 years every cycle uh pee troughs in the low 15 every cycle peaks in the high 17s to low 18 million right now we&#39;re at 15.8 million Sor the operating leverage of this business is such that they&#39;ve taken all the costs out of the business and every few hundred th000 few hundred th000 cars as we go from 158 of the bottom of the cycle to 177 half or 18 uh this business can generate $3 a share in earnings okay when we got involved with this stock you had something terrible called solvency risk okay those are two words you generally don&#39;t want to hear when you&#39;re getting into an investment they had to refinance about a billion dollars worth of debt in Fall of 2022 and Legend over here David kotak who&#39;s one of the best Bond people in the business an absolute Legend over over decades I just had a chance to meet him he&#39;s going to speak next uh tell you in Fall of 2020 was not the best time to refinance high yield debt it was a scary time the markets were closed and uh we got in on the basis that they had more than enough asset coverage that they would get it done one way or another and number one number two there was a lot of private credit swirling around so if they couldn&#39;t get it done on their own uh we could find a way to get them in front of people with credit uh private credit to get it refinanced long story short they got it refinanced Goldman charged them an arm and a leg and three four five legs but they got it done uh refinance risk was off the table and the stock shot off you know $5 $10 it shot up to $20 uh now back to 15 now I&#39;d love to say I&#39;m a genius and I thought of this all by myself but when I was I I asked uh some people asked what is what would Jesus do I asked what would Warren do I also asked what would Charlie do and I copied this idea from Charlie Munger who did the exact same trade in one of the six cycal Auto troughs in 2001 with a little company called tenaco okay who&#39;s heard of Monroe shock absorbers Dynamax exhaust products Etc and here&#39;s the beauty of what Charlie did he read an article in Barons uh about Teno having to refinance about a billion dollar of debt and he put $10 million into the equity and from that 10 million when they got refinanced and the cycle came back he turned the 10 million into 80 million and then he gave the 80 million to a guy named leelu to who started investing in China when no one was interested in China and you turn the 80 million into a half a billion so two chess moves a half a billion dollars who&#39;s interested in that okay so was Charlie buying the things that were already up 10x 20x 30X or was he buying the things that were out of favor that had a catalyst to turn around to take advantage the ladder right so that&#39;s exactly what&#39;s happening right now with Cooper standard we&#39;ve met with management multi mult multiple times we have confidence in their abilities um they also a lot of times when these small cap companies get into trouble they don&#39;t respect Equity so they issue a lot of shares they dilute the shareholders they&#39;ve actually brought the share count down while going through one of the most difficult periods in the Auto industry this is turning up we&#39;ve already tough the operating leverage they&#39;re now at break even they&#39;ve taken $500 million of cost out of the business as you see and the the number one leading indicator of Industry Auto volume for new cars is incentives okay and you&#39;ll see here incentives first off this chart on the top is the global light vehicle production forecast so as you can see this is very conservative right now because people are still pessimistic they expect it to go back to 2017 levels uh by 2028 we think it&#39;s going to happen sooner but on that basis um Cooper standard at that peak level earned $7 a share $719 a share and earnings in 2017 the stock traded at $146 we believe when we get those type of volumes whether it&#39;s 2027 or 2028 based on how the business has been uh better managed they&#39;re going to earn well more than $7 a share they could earn $10 a share and Beyond and the only question is what multiple is going to be applied to the stock a off multiple of 10 times or a peak multiple of 20 times so we think it&#39;s it&#39;s got huge upside even from $15 never mind $5 this will be a 10 to 15 bagg or overtime for us um so that&#39;s that that that&#39;s the incentives you can see going straight up our and if you thought that one was hairy okay I got one that&#39;s even hairier for you it&#39;s called Advanced Auto Parts you guys ever seen an advanced auto parts in your neighborhood okay this is the worst performing Auto retailer of all three Okay so whether you&#39;re talking about O&#39;Reilly etc etc the good news is they probably have the best CEO who&#39;s just come in his name is Shane o Kelly he ran HD Supply in uh for for Home Depot uh $7 billion business he&#39;s got a military background Harvard part business school he knows how to run these businesses and what he&#39;s basically done is he took solvency risk off the table recently by selling the Canadian business that was non- synergistic he created a $1.5 billion doar in cash for that net 1.2 uh paying down debt so he&#39;s brought the leverage ratios down to buy him time for the turn around and then he closed 10% of the stores on the west coast that were all spread out so you see that footprint of all the red dots all of those on the east coast is great where in most markets they&#39;re number one or number two and they have synergies and they have uh opportunity to really generate cash they closed they sold to Canada paid down the balance sheet they closed 700 stores on the west coast that were all spread out and now they&#39;re going to lower the the distribution centers from 38 to13 uh he expects to increase operating margins by 500 basis points over the next few years what that means in English they&#39;re going to generate $600 million in operating income and on that basis the last two three times that they generated $600 million plus of operating income was 2018 2019 and 2022 the stock is currently 45 bucks uh in those instances when they were generating that type of operating income the stock was $186 $182 and $240 I&#39;m not saying that it&#39;s going to go back there but I am saying there&#39;s an enormous opportunity again operating leverage Catalyst it&#39;s been der risked solvency risk has come off the table they sold off non-core assets same same type of story and this is how we can create doubles triples and stuff over a reasonable amount of time be patient build the position and wait good things come to those who wait right um and then",
      "election ### TECHNICAL_CHARTS\num here&#39;s the Nvidia okay so it peaked out at 14074 literally the day before I wrote that article on June 20th and since then we&#39;ve had exactly zero gains first we had an immediate 35% drop so that was pretty nice call and then um we recovered and now we&#39;re back down literally negative this is the hottest stock that people can&#39;t get get enough down at you know wherever it was in the 2020 lows you couldn&#39;t give it away now everybody wants it and I think",
      "the fact that since I posted that article on June 20th uh with Jenson Wong on the on the cover of the article you can go back to hedge fund tips commentary signing that girl&#39;s front area with a marker uh Nvidia has had negative returns since June of this year and you would not guess that based on the continued Euphoria around around the stock okay and um it&#39;s something to be cognizant of so Price to Book Tech bubble Peak it doesn&#39;t mean we&#39;re going to crash or Tech&#39;s going to crash or anything like that I think it does mean they are going to underperform relative to the unmagnify and xus and we&#39;re going to talk about some reasons why this is beauty to my eyes this is the Cox Automotive incentives are booming we jumped up again I think we at 7.6 last time we&#39;re at 8% of sales price sales prices ticked up a hair but they&#39;ve been basically flatlining for the last two plus years incentives are going up what is the number one key indicator of future volumes is incentives and this is exciting especially when we got a 16.5 mil SAR number last month uh when you annualize it out we are moving in the right direction as po per my presentation but this data is new as of today annual new stock BuyBacks continue to climb overall distressed rates by property type you&#39;ll see that office is still climbing a little bit retail is leveling off and Self Storage is rolling over as well as industrial rolling over you had a little bit of spike in the summer and that&#39;s come back down 007 Wells Fargo SE the S&P 500 at 7,7 in 2025 highest forecast on Wall Street so again this is stuff that you see all the time opinion follows Trend which um leads me to believe it&#39;s probably overshooting in the short term we&#39;re going to talk about some targets out there",
