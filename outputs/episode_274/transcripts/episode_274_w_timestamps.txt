[58.559s] amazing seg as a matter of fact it kind
[61.559s] of took me by surprise cuz you know you
[63.48s] send in some show notes and then they
[65.159s] changed the whole thing up and he&#39;s like
[66.96s] we&#39;re going to cover every pick you gave
[69.08s] us last year and I was like okay here we
[71.439s] go there there&#39;ll be a lot of good ones
[73.36s] but there are a couple ones that haven&#39;t
[74.72s] worked yet uh but um it was it was fair
[78.88s] so here we go hey joining me now I want
[81.079s] to bring in a great Capital uh chairman
[83.64s] Tom Hayes now you guys know Tom Hayes
[85.32s] from the show and the reason I don&#39;t
[87.079s] have Tom on more frequently is he&#39;s the
[88.88s] long term so he&#39;s going to tell you the
[90.28s] same thing over and over again but
[92.24s] here&#39;s the thing you want to listen to
[94.2s] what Tom Hayes has to say because this
[96.6s] guy has an amazing track record and he&#39;s
[98.759s] with us now Tom welcome to the show man
[100.52s] thanks for having me I just want to go
[101.92s] so you&#39;re a long-term investor that&#39;s
[103.439s] right so it&#39;s only fair to judge your
[105.32s] ideas I think at least on a year-to-year
[107.439s] basis correct so let&#39;s look at what you
[109.24s] gave us a year ago let&#39;s do it January
[113.04s] 2024 uh City up
[115.96s] 33% uh Bank of America up 33% Google up
[119.92s] 9% Amazon up 46% is that Crown cork
[123.64s] right there uh CCI crown castle that&#39;s
[126.52s] the only one that&#39;s down these are
[128.679s] amazing numbers my man I mean even even
[130.72s] with the 25% decline in there you&#39;ve got
[132.599s] four names up 30% one up almost 50% the
[135.92s] key here was to really I mean to know
[137.599s] Aid to fundamentals right yeah and to
[139.599s] have patience yeah we like to buy things
[141.599s] when when they&#39;re out of favor uh crown
[143.36s] castle that&#39;s gotten hit by rates it
[144.92s] actually had a rally and it&#39;s come back
[146.48s] in we we like crown castle here I think
[149.0s] you know it&#39;s very interesting when we
[150.2s] see rates I I heard your a block Jeff
[152.64s] talking about rates I&#39;ve heard Tom Lee
[154.68s] out there you know the 10year yield did
[157.4s] the exact same thing in Trump 1.0 right
[160.12s] after he got elected it blew out yields
[163.08s] blew out the dollar rallied like crazy
[165.44s] right after the inauguration you know
[166.76s] what happened bonds got bid
[168.8s] International stocks took off all the
[170.76s] things that people thought weren&#39;t going
[172.0s] to do well under Trump did extremely
[173.879s] well and what what actually did poorly
[175.84s] that first year energy did poorly that
[177.44s] first year yeah and ironically in this
[179.08s] last year uh solar stuff has been a
[181.159s] disaster right under under the Solar
[183.319s] stock of buying did great the first year
[185.2s] of trou yeah yeah so it&#39;s amazing to
[187.48s] when they Zig when they zag and the
[188.76s] markets start to price this thing or
[190.319s] they start to start to be in there so
[192.48s] what are you saying because the average
[193.879s] holding period like let&#39;s say 1960
[196.4s] people used to hold stocks six seven
[198.04s] years y it&#39;s down to five months so is
[201.08s] it is it tough just getting folks a hold
[202.92s] particularly when they don&#39;t move in
[204.12s] your direction initially well you know
[206.28s] it&#39;s interesting this has been an
[208.04s] aberration and we&#39;re all blinded by
[209.799s] recency bias since 1927 value has
[213.28s] outperformed growth by 4.4% per year so
[216.28s] what changed since 2010 growth is
[218.519s] absolutely smoked value uh and part of
[220.92s] that has to but is that a paradigm shift
[222.76s] it it could be people say uh Capital
[225.04s] light models Etc but what actually
[227.04s] happened was Zero interest rate policy
[228.959s] so unless you believe that we&#39;re going
[231.04s] back to zero interest rate policy which
[232.64s] you know today tells you and and I think
[234.4s] we&#39;re going to a normalized environment
[236.959s] uh you want to start to look at some
[239.159s] value stock you know the equity risk
[241.0s] premium everyone&#39;s talking about that is
[242.439s] very bearish it&#39;s the lowest it&#39;s been
[245.12s] since 2000 which was a generational buy
[247.28s] for value for international for small
[249.68s] caps Etc so I think we&#39;re going to have
[251.2s] some opportunities there I got 30
[252.68s] seconds to go I want to know use the
[254.36s] word normal I&#39;m hearing normal a lot
[255.92s] normalized what does that mean normal
[257.56s] what is a normal U Bond yeld yeah I I
[260.959s] think I think people overestimated us
[263.44s] taking the terminal rate down to two and
[265.479s] a half down to inflation we&#39;re going to
[267.4s] just simply go right back yeah I think
[269.0s] you know if you look at late 90s 3 and 1
[270.96s] half 4% is a reasonable place that where
[273.36s] you can have economic growth you can it
[275.6s] will be non contractionary and and
[278.44s] that&#39;s the right sweet spot when you
[280.08s] have demand what do you like here I&#39;m
[281.96s] rushing you because we we&#39;re running
[283.759s] past the time but we&#39;ve got to get some
[285.24s] jewels from you because you&#39;re rocking
[286.72s] and now people want to know what to buy
[288.36s] turn around Tom likes Advanced Auto
[290.479s] Parts this is the oh
[292.96s] no this is the worst run auto retailing
[296.84s] business I did a special on this bad boy
[299.0s] but they&#39;ve got Chan o Kelly he came
[300.52s] from HD Supply he sold off the Canada
[303.039s] business paid down debt that&#39;s the
[304.4s] number one thing in a turnaround is that
[306.12s] you have solvency risk off the table
[308.12s] closing the unprofitable disparate shops
[310.199s] on the west coast focusing on the areas
[312.039s] where he&#39;s number one and number two
[313.759s] targeting margins that imply $630
[316.12s] million operating income by 2027 last
[318.88s] time it had 630 million operating income
[321.08s] last four times stock traded between 180
[323.479s] and $240 it&#39;s a $45 stock today we like
[326.88s] this over the next two to three years my
[328.479s] man we we&#39;ll see before one year from
[330.88s] now but uh we&#39;re definitely going to be
[332.6s] watching I love it thank you so much
[333.96s] Budd apprciate all right folks we&#39;ll be
[335.919s] right
[339.56s] back and we&#39;re back uh so thanks to
[343.12s] Charles for that and then want to thank
[345.319s] Camille Smith for having me on CBS to
[347.56s] talk about inflation before the
[349.6s] inflation report here we go consumer
[352.08s] prize index report released this morning
[354.319s] as the country remains on inflation
[356.36s] watch economists are forecasting
[358.28s] December&#39;s CPI to rise 0.3% today&#39;s data
[362.039s] will figure into the fed&#39;s interest rate
[363.919s] decision which could impact short-term
[365.52s] loans if numbers come in lower we may
[368.0s] see relief on the auto and mortgage
[369.759s] front but people shouldn&#39;t be deterred
[371.72s] from borrowing some point you have to
[374.08s] get on with your life uh what we&#39;re
[376.12s] seeing is we have had a 100 basis points
[379.36s] a cut by the FED uh that&#39;s going to be
[382.52s] more effective as it relates to Shorter
[385.479s] term loans you&#39;re seeing it already in a
[388.0s] lot of Auto incentive
[390.12s] it has less importance as it relates to
[393.44s] morgage rates because mortgage rates are
[396.039s] longer duration loans that&#39;s usually
[398.08s] priced off the yield of the
[399.8s] 10year the CPI report will come out at
[402.039s] 8:30 this morning and we&#39;re back so
[406.639s] quotes of the week uh Peter theel the
[409.199s] most contrarian thing of all is not to
[411.88s] oppose the crowd but to actually think
[414.56s] for yourself and sometimes going with
[417.52s] the crowd is absolutely right and
[420.12s] sometimes uh particularly at turning
[422.759s] points you have to have some internal
[424.479s] fortitude to uh flip the other way and
[427.8s] the more and more biographies you read
[432.0s] of people who have been very very
[434.24s] successful throughout the ages um you
[437.479s] know going into the 19th century the
[439.24s] 20th century uh the common denominator
[442.72s] is usually if they didn&#39;t invent
[445.039s] something they bought assets when they
[448.12s] were out of favor that just just is
[450.319s] invariably the case they they didn&#39;t buy
[453.639s] assets on breakouts they didn&#39;t buy
[456.56s] assets when they were trading at 50
[458.319s] times sales uh they were sellers of
[461.08s] assets at at those levels but but not
[463.56s] buyers so uh Charlie Munger a lot of
[466.599s] people with high IQs are terrible
[469.159s] investors because they&#39;ve got terrible
[471.479s] temperaments look we cover that a lot on
[475.68s] this
[477.159s] podcast and and that&#39;s why a lot very
[479.879s] wealthy people allocate to me is because
[482.319s] the
[483.36s] characteristics that make someone
[486.96s] successful as an entrepreneur make
[489.039s] someone very successful in
[491.36s] business um are very different than the
[494.8s] characteristics that make someone
[496.08s] successful in investing in that in the
[500.08s] business World Massive Action equals
[503.479s] massive results the more you do the more
[505.8s] you get the more Relentless you are the
[508.319s] more activity you have in the pipeline
[511.28s] the more business you do the more money
[512.959s] you make in investing it&#39;s the
[516.12s] discipline to to do as little as
[519.519s] possible so massive inaction equals
[522.64s] massive results like Charlie Munger used
[524.72s] to say sit on your hands buy a good
[527.04s] business at a good price and sit on your
[528.839s] hands and that takes a lot of fortitude
[531.56s] because you&#39;re not just sitting there
[532.68s] twiddling your thumb you&#39;re consistently
[535.2s] researching you&#39;re consistently testing
[537.36s] your thesis you&#39;re consistently looking
[539.92s] at competition you&#39;re consistently
[542.24s] reading the transcripts doing Channel
[544.24s] checks Etc uh while you sit there and
[548.079s] and that&#39;s where the rewards start to
[550.079s] come you know whether it&#39;s uh com stock
[553.279s] resources which was kind of
[556.519s] interesting um I was thinking about you
[559.6s] know just looking at a couple of these
[561.279s] things that are starting to move
[565.04s] here um you know this one is is over a
[570.24s] double getting close to being a triple
[573.079s] and I had someone reach out and say why
[575.279s] don&#39;t we sell that and the answer is is
[579.24s] because
[580.399s] we enter a
[583.6s] business and own a piece of a business
[586.8s] when there is a meaningful margin of
[588.76s] safety and we can make at least a double
[590.68s] and in many cases a multibagger over a
[592.44s] reasonable amount of amount of time and
[595.6s] we know what intrinsic value is and
[599.079s] where we&#39;re willing to get out before we
[601.88s] even get in and we&#39;re nowhere near
[605.2s] intrinsic value so when we added the
[609.04s] pv10 the proved reserves that they have
[611.04s] to report to the SEC and our analysis of
[614.0s] the unproved reserves which is
[615.959s] materially more uh we don&#39;t get anywhere
[618.92s] near and then Bernstein was out thanks
[621.0s] to my buddy Allen for sending over uh
[624.04s] calling for a natural gas super cycle
[626.16s] and this looks a lot like the early
[628.2s] 2000s where you had this breakout and
[631.56s] then um and it just got started and the
[634.12s] thing went from you know 20 to 400 I&#39;m
[637.6s] not saying we&#39;re going to that level at
[639.92s] all we we&#39;d be out a lot sooner than
[642.0s] that anyway or at least with part of the
[644.079s] position we don&#39;t buy it all at once and
[645.519s] we don&#39;t sell it all at once we always
[646.92s] keep a flyer on in case it get goes as
[650.24s] irrationally to the upside as it does to
[652.519s] the downside because we want to
[653.56s] participate but that&#39;s well after we&#39;ve
[655.24s] taken all of our money off the table and
[657.519s] a ton of profits off the table and then
[659.88s] we just have a flyer to to catch these
[662.0s] ridiculous uh parabolic moves at the end
[664.959s] but um you know and then you even look
[666.959s] at um VF Corp which you couldn&#39;t give
[670.68s] away and you know here we are buying
[672.959s] three pairs of Vans buying you know 30
[675.16s] some odd pairs of Vans for the for the
[677.0s] clients for Christmas and everything
[678.48s] else and uh you know here&#39;s one I
[681.32s] remember being on the claim and
[682.56s] countdown last year with John Nigerian
[685.279s] talking about VF Corp when it was at
[687.519s] 1314 and uh you know getting a look like
[692.12s] uh like I had leprosy or something you
[695.56s] know uh a look at disbelief but now
[698.6s] we&#39;re at $23 so you know up some 50 plus
[702.279s] per and the story is literally just
[705.44s] getting started Brack and Daryl is a
[707.079s] winner you put a million bucks with him
[709.519s] uh at Logitech when it was down 82% in
[713.8s] when he uh joined in
[717.92s] 2013 and and uh stock was down from 26
[721.16s] down to five and uh you know this was a
[724.6s] 26 bagger you made 26 million bucks over
[727.0s] the next 10 years so uh that&#39;s kind of
[730.079s] interesting these are the things that we
[731.56s] do this is this is our calling in life
[734.68s] and we just rinse repeat over and over
[737.32s] and over so okay getting back to it uh
[742.68s] the other thing I want to
[744.959s] cover is the implied interest rate cut
[750.16s] odds since the inflation numbers came
[753.199s] out and these have
[757.44s] improved pretty
[763.399s] materially now looking at
[766.36s] a
[768.24s] 60 a 73 I&#39;m sorry 63% chance of the
[774.32s] first cut coming in
[777.88s] June with which going into the inflation
[781.639s] report starting the year as
[786.399s] expectations dropped okay people were
[789.279s] basically saying no cuts and starting to
[791.04s] talk about hikes it always swings to the
[792.92s] extreme if you remember a year or so ago
[795.24s] they expected six Cuts uh they always
[798.36s] overshoot so this year they started the
[800.36s] year expecting you know basically no
[802.639s] Cuts if you a week ago and some people
[804.88s] were calling for hikes so now we&#39;re back
[807.12s] to you know 63% chance in June which
[810.24s] implies two cuts for the year you had
[812.199s] Waller on this morning on CNBC uh
[814.88s] singing the same song and you had um uh
[819.76s] ghouls be as well and this would imply
[822.8s] one in June maybe one in one in October
[826.72s] for two cuts for the year that takes the
[828.92s] FED funds rate down to uh
[833.48s] 375 and that&#39;s probably the terminal
[835.88s] rate and that is beautiful that probably
[839.8s] gets a five handle high five handle on
[843.519s] the 30-year mortgage which absolutely
[847.6s] skyrockets the Home Building business
[851.24s] and all ancillary related businesses
[854.8s] like Stanley Black and&amp; Decker and many
[858.8s] others so that&#39;s that now want to go
[862.079s] through some charts
[863.72s] here uh talk about where we are with the
[867.56s] General Market
[869.759s] uh couple here that stand out I would
[872.639s] say this NY this
[876.759s] nysi uh oversold this is usually where
[879.72s] you start to see some bounces uh and we
[883.079s] saw some follow saw some uh recovery
[885.88s] yesterday a little bit of follow through
[887.639s] so far today minus United
[890.92s] Healthcare um
[895.68s] also the NASDAQ mlen oscillator less
[898.759s] over oversold than the nysse that makes
[901.36s] a lot of sense based on the things that
[902.8s] we&#39;ve been saying in the last few weeks
[904.839s] here is the S&amp;P 500 bullish percent down
[908.04s] to 40% on a point and figure Buy Signal
[912.36s] you don&#39;t need to know what that is all
[913.639s] you need to know is what happens to the
[916.279s] market when these get at or near these
[920.16s] extreme levels and the answer is you
[922.199s] usually get a bounce
[924.88s] um pring Emerging Market diffusion in
[928.319s] indicator uh not only do you get a
[930.399s] bounce in Emerging Markets you tend to
[932.839s] get a bounce in the S&amp;P also when this
[934.88s] gets uh oversold and then pmo by SPX is
[939.319s] coming off the boil got down to uh 12%
[944.72s] on pmo crossover all that is is like a
[946.959s] moving average convergence Divergence uh
[949.72s] crossover which is you know it is what
[951.72s] it is anyway it&#39;s moving in the right
[953.44s] direction pmo by Dow Jones Industrial
[957.44s] starting to come off the boil got down
[959.079s] below 15 up to 30 so these are things
[961.68s] that point to some level of recovery
[964.6s] here in the first quarter uh after the
[967.24s] December and early January pause uh S&amp;P
[972.0s] mlen summation index again these are
[974.36s] levels where you tend to get bounces in
[976.44s] the SNP when it gets this extreme below
[979.92s] -400 so we like that NASDAQ intermediate
[983.56s] term momentum oscillator again oversold
[987.319s] so you know these are just barometer
[989.319s] they&#39;re not foolproof Dow Dow
[991.12s] intermediate term breath momentum same
[993.839s] thing you get below -50 these things
[996.199s] tend to bounce uh and so on just putting
[999.0s] things in perspective real estate looks
[1000.92s] oversold here it got to uh
[1005.079s] 30% above their 200 day exponential
[1008.12s] moving average again that tends to be
[1009.72s] bounce level pmo by all got down to 5%
[1013.0s] it&#39;s bouncing off that I don&#39;t know
[1014.36s] where that went but
[1017.04s] um so we like that
[1019.88s] then uh this you can&#39;t make this stuff
[1022.519s] up but clsa I guess that&#39;s an Asian Bank
[1026.799s] uh inhouse proprietary model projects a
[1030.28s] 40% rally in the hangsang index this
[1034.0s] year from their lips to God&#39;s ear let&#39;s
[1036.799s] look at the uh basis of this uh
[1040.439s] comprehensive analysis quote secret
[1044.36s] hissings Point towards good rises in the
[1048.16s] market through through the spring and
[1049.919s] winter a long period of summerish
[1052.799s] lassitude and small Falls throughout the
[1055.64s] year for oop files and lovers of other
[1059.6s] slithery Critters we&#39;ve pegged each
[1062.2s] month to a different species of snake
[1065.0s] and see them sloughing off their skins
[1068.6s] to reveal like Russian dolls the true
[1071.4s] inner snake of the hangang index
[1075.159s] 2025 Fang Sho index is now out the wood
[1081.12s] snakes going to be epic for Chinese
[1084.679s] markets okay so this is a real Bank
[1088.159s] putting out an analysis of the hangsang
[1092.36s] on the basis of year of the snake you
[1096.24s] can&#39;t make this up so whatever works uh
[1099.96s] the the comedic nature of uh investing
[1104.039s] in China as it has been uh probably
[1107.28s] supports that this is the Catalyst that
[1109.919s] finally makes the trade work because
[1113.24s] fundamentals uh have not mattered but uh
[1116.08s] leaving that aside uh it&#39;s it&#39;s good to
[1119.24s] uh it&#39;s good to have some fun with this
[1121.039s] stuff let&#39;s get down to business here
[1122.919s] ton of data realized and consensus EPS
[1127.799s] growth for select us indices this is the
[1130.799s] Russell 2000 and I&#39;ve been talking about
[1133.2s] 21% earnings growth for the small caps
[1135.799s] what was that based on
[1139.559s] that was based on the S&amp;P 600 index
[1142.64s] which is more profitable based on the
[1145.64s] comp composition the regular Russell
[1148.12s] 2000 has more companies that are losing
[1151.12s] money which is always the case at
[1154.0s] massive inflection points for small caps
[1157.4s] just like the early 2000s uh when you
[1159.799s] had record companies losing money before
[1161.6s] you had the biggest seven-year run in
[1163.48s] history uh and the same thing is true
[1166.2s] for this year so if you look at the
[1167.72s] Russell versus the S&amp;P 600 which I&#39;ve
[1170.88s] been using because it&#39;s more
[1171.919s] conservative and sounds more realistic
[1174.24s] the Russell uh is expected to have
[1178.0s] 44% earnings growth next year trading at
[1182.24s] 16 times versus uh the S&amp;P 500 133%
[1189.0s] earnings growth uh equal weight 133%
[1192.039s] earnings growth NASDAQ 121% earnings
[1195.08s] growth so double the earnings growth
[1198.84s] half the multiple pretty exciting stuff
[1202.64s] uh this is from the FED
[1204.24s] Whisperer Nick timos confirming what we
[1206.84s] said now looking at two rate Cuts uh
[1209.799s] this shows Rising interest rates
[1211.799s] pressuring stocks you can see all of
[1213.44s] these spikes and we believe this is a
[1215.2s] temporary third
[1218.76s] Spike um led to weakness in the stock
[1222.12s] market and then yields rolled over and
[1224.36s] the stock market recovered we expect the
[1226.28s] same thing this time uh the other reason
[1229.28s] I had this chart up is I wanted to show
[1231.559s] you the US dollar cuz we&#39;ve talked about
[1234.0s] it in Trump 1.0 it&#39;s kind of eerily
[1238.76s] similar whether you look at the early
[1241.559s] 2000s which we&#39;ve used as a point of
[1243.64s] reference for quite some time where you
[1245.72s] had this kind of rally in the dollar and
[1249.6s] then a little bit of consolidation and
[1251.44s] then a final Peak double Peak top and
[1254.4s] then a complete rollover back down to uh
[1257.36s] where it started
[1259.159s] or if you&#39;re less bearish on the dollar
[1262.28s] and you look at the Trump bump huge
[1264.2s] rally into the Trump
[1267.96s] um uh election here as we&#39;ve seen in the
[1271.48s] last two years then you get this final
[1273.88s] Peak after the election into the
[1276.08s] inauguration and then you get a rollover
[1278.159s] for the next year that&#39;s when Chinese
[1279.799s] stocks went absolutely bananas as a
[1282.4s] reminder uh well the only Chinese stock
[1285.76s] we care about in the year of the snake
[1288.32s] is is Baba and you can see what happened
[1291.48s] you had the same buildup into the
[1294.08s] election then uh in anticipation uh of
[1297.44s] the inauguration huge selloff for 3 four
[1299.84s] months uh and then straight up parabolic
[1302.52s] move from 84 to 200 and change which is
[1307.0s] why
[1308.72s] um uh we we were uh opened up to new
[1312.36s] money early and congratulations by the
[1314.159s] way uh already a handful of new people
[1316.48s] came in congratulations on that and
[1319.08s] we&#39;re going to close out on Friday well
[1321.96s] the end of this week what Friday
[1323.44s] Saturday Sunday it doesn&#39;t matter before
[1325.039s] the
[1325.72s] inauguration and uh and and get that
[1328.2s] money deployed ahead of time which is
[1330.4s] pretty exciting uh for those folks so
[1332.96s] congratulations on that and then
[1338.32s] uh so this is that that we also talk
[1341.88s] about it in the context of the dollar
[1343.52s] two things that are setting up perfectly
[1345.84s] just like last few times uh this is not
[1351.44s] combine return so basically we came into
[1354.559s] this week into the inflation print with
[1356.679s] the expectation of zero Cuts this year
[1359.12s] you had five straight weeks of losses
[1362.24s] for both the stock market and uh
[1365.72s] treasuries that is now flipping on its
[1368.039s] head and turning pretty abruptly the
[1370.48s] last two days which is exciting to see
[1373.64s] um and
[1376.2s] then here is the
[1380.32s] bond yield cycle
[1383.48s] composite okay the bond yield cycle
[1385.64s] composite in 2025 this is from lold
[1388.799s] their kind of case we covered last week
[1390.84s] was that yields rise until February and
[1393.32s] then and then roll over uh I think it&#39;s
[1395.44s] going to be sooner than that I think I
[1396.88s] think a better analog is probably what
[1398.72s] happened in Trump 1.0 where they started
[1400.799s] to roll over right after the
[1402.64s] inauguration maybe even a little bit
[1404.6s] before which is what we&#39;re seeing now
[1406.24s] City Group economic surprise index
[1408.64s] turning back up pretty exciting to see
[1412.24s] uh concentration of S&amp;P market cap and
[1414.48s] earnings in the 10 largest index
[1419.039s] constituents so you haven&#39;t seen this
[1421.76s] level of
[1423.039s] Divergence between percent share of the
[1426.88s] S&amp;P market cap relative to share of S&amp;P
[1432.12s] earnings so you got a spread here you
[1434.84s] got 39% of the market cap but only 28%
[1437.6s] of the earnings which is has been a
[1438.919s] multiple expansion story uh aggressive
[1443.32s] multiple expansion story and honestly
[1445.52s] the last time you saw anything like that
[1447.52s] was in 2000 when you had
[1450.0s] 27% market cap and only 20% of the
[1453.919s] earnings and you know what happened next
[1456.279s] uh in that instance Tech crashed uh for
[1460.6s] the next few years I don&#39;t think we&#39;re
[1463.76s] going to crash on Tech uh oh and by the
[1467.48s] way while Tech was crashing if you owned
[1470.039s] value small cap and international you
[1472.76s] made so much money you could
[1476.279s] smile so wide and eat four bananas
[1479.2s] sideways that&#39;s really what was
[1480.6s] happening from 2000 to 2007 so I think
[1484.2s] it&#39;ll be a more muted scenario where you
[1487.08s] get consolidation in this uh but you do
[1491.88s] get a reversion back
[1494.72s] to market cap share reverting back to
[1498.08s] earning grow so either earnings growth
[1499.679s] needs to move they need to cover uh 40%
[1503.679s] of you know 40% earnings of the S&amp;P and
[1508.08s] stay 40% of the market cap which is not
[1511.039s] happening their earnings growth is
[1512.84s] decelerating from 33% now to 18% not
[1517.08s] 21% uh the mag 7
[1519.679s] so uh be careful if you are overweight
[1523.6s] and you may be more overweight than you
[1525.76s] think not knowing it because you own the
[1528.12s] s P
[1529.399s] 500 uh which is 40% in mag 7 so that&#39;s
[1533.559s] pretty aggressive spending growth for
[1536.559s] clothing up 5 8.5% month on month was
[1539.52s] strong in December clothing uh we also
[1543.24s] have cold weather so that should be
[1545.08s] helpful for goose I&#39;m seeing a lot of
[1547.6s] Vans around here now I I am in
[1549.6s] California now so I guess you know
[1551.64s] you&#39;re born wearing vans in California
[1554.32s] uh have to keep Channel checking every
[1557.159s] time I go back to New York work at each
[1558.96s] month uh households are very optimistic
[1561.84s] about the US economy that since the
[1563.6s] election that&#39;s very
[1565.679s] constructive uh actually before the
[1567.64s] election a little bit here so that&#39;s
[1569.2s] good uh wage growth has converged for
[1572.0s] all income cohorts growth remain solid
[1574.84s] up 3% so that&#39;s good the lower income is
[1577.159s] starting to catch up to the higher
[1578.399s] income
[1579.52s] growth consumers continue to show solid
[1582.799s] momentum with spending up 2.2% in
[1585.08s] December so that&#39;s going to bode well
[1586.6s] for earnings earnings expect ation are
[1588.88s] pretty high at 11% and change and then
[1593.2s] you&#39;ve got
[1595.32s] China record us minus China real yield
[1601.84s] spread
[1603.36s] historically this has
[1605.44s] been the times that you wanted to be an
[1608.279s] owner of China&#39;s stocks whether it&#39;s uh
[1611.399s] late 2008 early 2009 we also got close
[1615.12s] there uh in that 2016 to 20 2017 period
[1619.399s] 2010 2011 and then the early 2000s so
[1623.32s] you know just looking at all these
[1624.64s] things the weight of the evidence these
[1626.64s] these are not foolproof indicators if
[1630.0s] this then that um which is
[1633.799s] why uh in the history of mankind there&#39;s
[1636.799s] been only one person that beat the
[1638.64s] market using computers which is uh
[1641.919s] renissance
[1643.24s] technology and there was another factor
[1646.52s] it&#39;s not just machine learning and all
[1648.72s] that it&#39;s what questions do you ask and
[1651.32s] if there&#39;s not the proper Market
[1654.679s] framework and history to ask the right
[1656.72s] questions it&#39;s just like putting the
[1658.0s] right prompts into G GPT uh you don&#39;t
[1661.24s] wind up with the right outcome and um so
[1664.72s] that&#39;s that moving along USG USD
[1668.279s] investment grade Bond maturity
[1670.76s] wall
[1673.039s] uh 2025 is subdued
[1676.36s] maturities 26 picks up a little bit 27
[1679.919s] and then it goes back down uh the
[1683.08s] biggest maturities are 2 2045 and
[1688.84s] Beyond Euro investment grade bond market
[1692.24s] maturity wall picks up next
[1695.0s] year US dollar high yield bond market
[1699.399s] big maturity wall in 2028 2029 2025 not
[1704.12s] much matures so they got it all
[1705.6s] refinanced during covid which is awesome
[1707.76s] that&#39;s very very good for the markets so
[1710.48s] I you know this is kind of the Year
[1712.12s] where it might start to get a little
[1713.64s] shaky 2027 Euro high yield bond market
[1717.24s] hits the maturity wall also in 2028 so
[1719.919s] keep an eye on that business but if you
[1722.2s] know rates go down this year a lot of
[1723.919s] them can refinance if the Market&#39;s open
[1726.08s] business bankruptcy filings per capita
[1728.039s] people have been talking about this to
[1729.159s] spike back up it hasn&#39;t even got back up
[1731.279s] to pream pandemic levels and it already
[1733.679s] looks like it&#39;s rolling over so so far
[1735.399s] so good this is a key chart that we
[1738.48s] contined to remind you to pay close
[1741.12s] attention to which is the Japanese
[1746.2s] government bond
[1749.519s] yield uh continues to climb higher which
[1752.559s] is why you&#39;ve seen such a hit to the
[1754.679s] nvidias the Palante teers the mag 7 of
[1759.44s] late this is the carry trade on wine
[1761.84s] this is all the free money that&#39;s poured
[1764.36s] into those concentrated stocks was a
[1768.12s] quote unquote risk-free return because
[1771.64s] you had no cost of capital now it&#39;s a
[1774.88s] return free risk uh it&#39;s amazing how
[1777.96s] that flips on its
[1779.799s] head this is a note from Bank of America
[1782.279s] concentration risk for stocks Denmark
[1784.399s] stock market is down 20% since September
[1787.24s] driven by Nova nordis was about 60% of
[1789.64s] the stock market do you all remember
[1792.84s] when I was
[1794.84s] on Yahoo finance when there was was the
[1798.64s] absolute Mania about the glp 1es and it
[1803.6s] was a segment
[1805.36s] called
[1808.799s] um
[1810.6s] buy goodbye or goodbye so what&#39;s a
[1814.799s] what&#39;s something to buy and what&#39;s
[1816.0s] something to say goodbye to and I talked
[1818.48s] about it was a healthc care theme I
[1820.76s] talked about buy
[1822.08s] bter uh and sell or lighten up on Eli
[1827.399s] Lily okay Eli Lily&#39;s coming a little bit
[1831.0s] um uh materially and the Baxter hasn&#39;t
[1835.08s] moved yet but Baxter is going to move
[1836.519s] because they&#39;re going to sell off
[1837.6s] they&#39;re going to get the $3 billion
[1839.039s] they&#39;re going to pay down that interest
[1840.519s] rate going to go down and you&#39;re going
[1841.919s] to get a multiple reating because
[1843.12s] they&#39;re selling off the slow growth
[1844.76s] kidney business that compressed the
[1846.159s] multiple and then the remaining business
[1848.12s] has higher growth and then you&#39;re going
[1849.799s] to get a reating back to 16 17 18 times
[1852.32s] and you get a stock that shoots from 40
[1853.88s] to 60 pretty quick so um
[1859.279s] so what they&#39;re saying here is best
[1861.72s] reminder of oh so two points I wanted to
[1864.279s] make on that one was that if you think
[1868.639s] you know people felt that there was no
[1870.519s] competition coming from a zic and Zep
[1873.159s] bound Etc um The Lily the Lily glp ones
[1878.6s] the competition came more competition
[1880.679s] has come more competition is coming so
[1883.2s] that is the same thing you will see the
[1885.559s] exact same thing with Nvidia okay for
[1888.32s] those of you who weren&#39;t even through
[1890.72s] puberty the last major semi SE
[1892.84s] semiconductor Cycles I can assure you
[1895.399s] competition is coming for NVIDIA and the
[1898.399s] margins will contract and the spend will
[1901.12s] be reduced as we move from the large
[1903.039s] language model phase of AI to the
[1905.44s] inference phase which takes a lot less
[1908.159s] uh um horsepower than the heavy lift
[1912.48s] which is the large language model which
[1913.799s] is what we&#39;ve been going through and all
[1915.32s] you need to do is look at the capex
[1917.919s] plans for big Tech uh materially lower
[1921.399s] spend this year than last year and that
[1923.76s] will continue to go down as they
[1926.0s] continue to see that the return on
[1927.559s] invested capital is di Minimus they are
[1929.84s] making the Investments not getting the
[1931.48s] returns and that&#39;s why you&#39;re seeing
[1935.24s] uh Microsoft announced this week cutting
[1937.72s] 5% of Staff Facebook this week announced
[1941.44s] cutting 5% of staff and you&#39;re going to
[1943.36s] start to see more and more headlines
[1944.76s] because they got all this spend and they
[1946.519s] got no return from the spend so they&#39;re
[1948.519s] going to look for cheaper ways
[1950.399s] to retain share they don&#39;t want to seed
[1953.48s] potential share to their competitors but
[1955.88s] do it in a way where uh the bleeding in
[1959.2s] the short
[1960.24s] term uh is containable until the
[1963.399s] realization of what everyone&#39;s expecting
[1965.72s] which will come true it&#39;ll just happen
[1967.76s] many years uh further out than we expect
[1970.96s] just like Amazon in
[1973.639s] 2000 everything that we thought Amazon
[1977.36s] would change in the world they&#39;ve done
[1979.6s] it just you were paying for 100% of that
[1982.72s] happening in 2000 when it actually
[1986.08s] realized by 2015 so in the interim
[1990.08s] because you paid for guaranteed outcome
[1994.0s] that wouldn&#39;t come till 15 years later
[1996.399s] you had a 90% draw down in the short
[1999.039s] term even though you were right about
[2001.159s] the story price is what you pay value is
[2003.0s] what you get you paid too much for what
[2005.639s] had not yet happened so this stock had
[2008.08s] to go down 90% And then take 10 years to
[2010.559s] recover and and fulfill on the promise
[2013.039s] of what&#39;s happening and we see this
[2015.519s] every single time whether it&#39;s going to
[2017.279s] be the gp1s that are going to get uh hit
[2021.12s] with competition or Nvidia that&#39;s going
[2023.159s] to get hit with competition all the
[2024.919s] beautiful things that Ai and the gp1s
[2027.279s] are doing will probably happen uh uh
[2031.399s] it&#39;ll just in the case of the AI it will
[2034.72s] take a little longer than expected and
[2036.6s] you&#39;re already paying more than what
[2039.2s] that value is worth and in the case of
[2042.08s] gp1s it&#39;s just going to be a competition
[2044.08s] Fest rate race to the bottom uh uh but
[2047.519s] more and more people will use it which
[2049.0s] will offset some of that which is which
[2050.76s] is a good thing
[2052.8s] so uh here&#39;s what she&#39;s saying note
[2055.48s] Magnificent Seven stocks have
[2057.04s] contributed
[2058.32s] 57% uh of S&amp;P return in 2024 have a
[2061.52s] combined weight index of 34% currently
[2064.52s] up to 38% of client Equity portfolio and
[2068.0s] most investors see AI bubble as B
[2070.04s] biggest upside risk best play to hedge
[2073.32s] us concentration risk increase
[2076.04s] International stock exposure in UK EU
[2080.639s] and China which outperform the US in
[2084.44s] 2024 and long despised Euro and Chinese
[2089.2s] Yuan after the Tariff announcements this
[2093.28s] is Brilliance from Michael Hartnett who
[2096.919s] is one of the best sell-side analyst in
[2099.76s] the business
[2102.56s] um I love his contrarian writings AI
[2106.24s] bubble okay so best hedge increase
[2109.44s] International stock exposure in the UK
[2111.52s] EU and China we love that call uh and
[2116.44s] buy the Euro and the Chinese Yuan after
[2118.96s] the tar tariff announcements absolutely
[2121.68s] love it uh here&#39;s what Els he said Doge
[2125.24s] plus nominal GDP boom plus creative debt
[2128.96s] management EG Trump Taps
[2132.0s] $35 trillion in home equity vers via a
[2137.079s] new gsse to help pay off $36 trillion of
[2141.839s] US debt causes us budget deficit as a
[2144.92s] percentage of GDP to fall towards 3% us
[2149.64s] 10-year treasury Falls below 3% very
[2153.44s] risk positive best play long the 30-year
[2157.8s] treasury this guy is like uh you know
[2163.0s] singing the same song I love this thesis
[2166.119s] this this is a
[2167.76s] new mix on it but if they did something
[2171.079s] around the mortgages with all the equity
[2173.68s] and that became spending Firepower we
[2176.04s] could see nominal growth which is what
[2177.839s] I&#39;ve said the only way they&#39;re going to
[2179.0s] get debt to GDP down is run nominal
[2181.4s] growth super hot run inflation slightly
[2183.96s] above Trend uh plus 3% and uh if they do
[2189.8s] that $36 trillion in new spend into the
[2192.359s] economy from home equity uh that could
[2195.2s] be monstrous and that that wasn&#39;t um
[2198.76s] something on my bingo card but uh
[2201.0s] keeping an open mind biggest inflow to
[2203.56s] cash since April 20th of course that
[2205.72s] happened right before the
[2207.24s] reversal uh bull bear indicator at
[2210.359s] bearish levels not near top levels
[2213.56s] moving on Japanese 10year government Buy
[2217.68s] yield this is the unwind of the carry
[2219.24s] trade for those of you guys don&#39;t know
[2220.599s] what I&#39;m talking about go look at an S&amp;P
[2223.2s] chart for the first one or two weeks of
[2225.44s] August last year when the bank of Japan
[2229.04s] uh decided to hike
[2232.2s] rates and which is basically unwind the
[2235.119s] carry trade hurt people with leverage on
[2236.92s] that trade uh and then they had to walk
[2238.92s] it back after you saw what happened with
[2240.359s] the market more of that to come they
[2242.079s] have no choice inflation is ramping back
[2244.52s] up in China they&#39;re going to continue to
[2245.96s] hike uh against weak demographics and
[2249.079s] it&#39;s going to be a bad thing and then
[2250.4s] you&#39;re going to see all that hot money
[2252.359s] that was Asia focused that used Japan as
[2256.119s] a false Safe Haven during the China
[2259.16s] downturn as China turns up uh all that
[2261.839s] money is going to shoot out of there and
[2263.2s] shoot out of India like it&#39;s going out
[2264.76s] of style India&#39;s overvalued right now
[2267.52s] and um it&#39;s all going to go into China
[2270.48s] Chinese 10-year government bond yields
[2272.2s] starting to move up that&#39;s a positive
[2273.839s] sign we want to see their currency go up
[2275.56s] and the yields go up is a sign of
[2277.96s] everything else moving if you look at
[2279.4s] every cycle we&#39;ve covered that a million
[2281.0s] times pboc halts Bond buying to defend
[2283.64s] Yuan as economic Gloom worsens uh
[2287.76s] headline from Bloomberg of course with
[2289.56s] that character about it this is the US
[2293.4s] dollar Chinese Yuan what here&#39;s what&#39;s
[2295.8s] interesting ladies and gentlemen look
[2297.28s] how much the dollar has appreciated
[2299.359s] against the Chinese Yuan this is not by
[2301.16s] accident this is exactly what they did
[2304.56s] in
[2305.56s] 201627 when Trump was threatening
[2308.04s] tariffs he&#39;s like they&#39;re like oh okay
[2310.68s] you want to you want to tariff us 20%
[2313.72s] we&#39;ll just devalue our currency by 20%
[2315.92s] and call it a day
[2318.76s] um and this time is no different it&#39;s
[2321.04s] kind of comical but they go through this
[2323.2s] dance and uh it&#39;s good for political
[2325.64s] headlines and uh but it has no net
[2327.96s] effect dollar Yuan exchange rate here&#39;s
[2330.359s] the 30-year historical uh look ladies
[2332.92s] and gentlemen I just pointed it out to
[2334.48s] you here visually so you could see we&#39;ve
[2337.64s] seen this same silly movie before right
[2341.44s] up to January 23rd which was the
[2344.079s] inauguration at January 20 2017 there&#39;s
[2347.92s] the inauguration you had this weakness
[2350.04s] in the Yuan and then as soon as the
[2352.68s] inauguration Yuan rolls uh
[2356.359s] um you dollar rolls over Yuan
[2360.72s] strengthens and Chinese equities take
[2363.8s] off same exact Playbook I mean it&#39;s it&#39;s
[2368.119s] comical small is less than 4% of the US
[2372.079s] Equity Market these are extremes that
[2374.52s] you saw last in when
[2377.119s] 2000 then back in 73 remember I&#39;ve
[2380.2s] talked in the 70s all the value guys
[2382.68s] made their billions like uh cooperman
[2385.68s] gabelli Buffett Etc even though the
[2389.2s] market did nothing for 12
[2391.52s] years these are the times where fortunes
[2394.8s] are made ladies and gentlemen Buffett
[2396.68s] got started in 50s here this was the
[2399.319s] exact same environment Ben Graham here
[2402.44s] in the 30s when when this is like this
[2405.92s] this is when we make so much
[2407.76s] money it&#39;s insane and these inflection
[2411.44s] points are where fortunes are made so
[2413.119s] just keep your eye on the prize total
[2415.64s] unrealized gain loss as a percentage of
[2418.56s] Bank Equity Capital so there&#39;s uh
[2421.16s] there&#39;s still upside down on the bonds
[2422.76s] it&#39;s something worth keeping an eye on
[2424.319s] we&#39;ve had a huge run in C first and
[2427.44s] foremost we had a huge run in the uh BAC
[2430.24s] and the city which we took off last
[2431.76s] summer it&#39;s now moved up a little bit
[2433.52s] after earnings we uh still own the um uh
[2439.599s] Regional Bank basket that we bought
[2442.28s] during the mini banking crisis with
[2445.56s] svb uh in I think it was March 2023
[2449.28s] that&#39;s up I think about double now and
[2451.839s] we&#39;re probably going to get a little
[2452.92s] more juice out of that before we start
[2454.56s] to peel it off I think there&#39;s probably
[2456.079s] another 20% in it but um that&#39;s where it
[2459.64s] is US treasuries entering sixth year of
[2462.72s] third Great Bond bear Market in the past
[2466.119s] 24 years uh ladies and gentlemen here&#39;s
[2470.24s] the recency bias that rates are going to
[2472.52s] keep going up like they did in 1980
[2474.599s] here&#39;s the reality since 1790 these are
[2477.68s] normal spikes before rollovers normal
[2480.119s] spikes before rollovers you had one and
[2482.839s] by the way very interesting ladies and
[2485.2s] gentlemen if you read a history book
[2486.88s] it&#39;s amazing what it can tell you
[2488.48s] potentially about the future the last
[2490.92s] Spike up we had like this that wasn&#39;t
[2494.119s] 1980 was right after what the Spanish
[2497.92s] flu right after 1918 to the early 20s
[2502.48s] you had this initial Spike up because of
[2504.24s] the supply chain disruptions and other
[2506.319s] similar characteristics to what we had
[2508.319s] here and then you had a roll
[2510.88s] over for the next uh all the way to 1948
[2516.72s] so from you know call it 1920 18 years
[2520.2s] I&#39;m not saying that&#39;s going to repeat
[2521.56s] per se but but these abrupt spikes
[2525.16s] caused by exogenous events are more the
[2529.28s] rule than the exception you had a
[2531.839s] similar situation in
[2534.119s] 1859 uh then in
[2536.44s] 1837 and then in
[2538.839s] 1795 so that is more likely and by the
[2542.92s] way if you take out this one exception
[2544.52s] you could draw a downtrend line uh it&#39;s
[2546.96s] kind kind of interesting us 10-year
[2550.0s] Break Even rate so inflation
[2552.359s] expectations had shot up ahead of the
[2555.839s] inflation
[2557.119s] reports uh this week that&#39;s now probably
[2560.079s] rolled over just like the in uh cut
[2563.28s] expectations have rolled over China CPI
[2566.04s] year onye uh spiked up rolled back so
[2569.72s] it&#39;s still
[2571.079s] positive uh they continue to say it&#39;s
[2573.48s] deflation but you still have positive
[2575.359s] prints uh CPI year onye is also turning
[2579.4s] back
[2583.359s] up PPI turning up that&#39;s a leading
[2586.559s] indicator not a lagging indicator then
[2589.48s] you&#39;ve got China net purchases by
[2593.839s] assets this shows very
[2597.839s] interesting uh
[2600.64s] their purchases of
[2603.68s] US Government corporate Federal agency
[2606.48s] bonds corporate stocks foreign stocks
[2609.92s] foreign bonds corporate bonds and uh
[2613.92s] treasury bonds and notes and you have
[2616.4s] not
[2618.28s] seen this type of
[2621.079s] negative purchases by the Chinese of
[2625.2s] these assets since those areas preceding
[2629.559s] the last five rallies in Chinese
[2633.92s] equities uh so they kept their powder
[2636.079s] dry and probably reallocated to the
[2638.04s] Chinese Equity so last time you saw it
[2640.44s] was 2001 preceding a monster rally in
[2644.319s] Chinese Equity 2008 another monster
[2647.28s] rally 2012 same thing
[2650.68s] 2017 16 into 17 last time you saw this
[2654.119s] boom same thing in early 2020 and then
[2658.599s] boom these were all preceding major
[2661.96s] rallies in China Equity so you know
[2664.68s] India&#39;s World beating e economic growth
[2666.599s] is Moder ating I I would be not
[2669.48s] allocating any money to India right now
[2671.68s] that money is going to go into China and
[2673.319s] it&#39;s going to do it fast along with the
[2675.079s] Japanese money here&#39;s the copper to gold
[2677.72s] ratio again this is what you saw in late
[2681.04s] 2016 early 2017 which precedes what
[2685.4s] major rallies in China economy every
[2688.559s] single time this got down to this level
[2690.44s] early 2000s 2008 it it preceded a
[2694.04s] monster recovery in China economy and
[2696.4s] China stock stocks
[2699.52s] so uh market cap of the largest stock
[2703.839s] relative to the 75th percentile stock
[2706.68s] weight of the top 10 stocks in the S&amp;P
[2708.68s] 500 so I continue to just reemphasize
[2712.68s] this these are concentration risks that
[2716.0s] we haven&#39;t seen since great financial
[2718.28s] crisis do bubble
[2720.68s] nifty50 Great Depression Etc if you are
[2724.2s] in the concentrated stocks I think you
[2726.44s] are not going to be happy so um you
[2730.319s] don&#39;t have to get out of all of them I
[2731.72s] think they&#39;ll do okay I just think
[2733.52s] they&#39;re going to do a lot less well
[2735.44s] because this concentration risk is going
[2737.559s] to disperse as the rest of the market
[2740.28s] with earnings growth acceleration takes
[2743.04s] overshare from the concentrated part
[2745.839s] that has earnings growth deceleration
[2748.44s] down from 33 last year to 18 this year
[2751.2s] but the multiple has not yet rated I
[2753.4s] think that&#39;s coming ladies and gentlemen
[2755.52s] the copper gold ratio same story here
[2758.839s] relative to the 10-year treasury yield I
[2761.359s] think this meets in the middle I think
[2762.68s] the 10-year treasury yield rolls over
[2766.0s] and I think the copper gold uh
[2768.119s] accelerates just like we saw preceding
[2770.599s] those uh uh rallies in 2017
[2774.4s] 2020 uh 2012 and 2008 in China equities
[2780.16s] so just cutting at it from a million
[2782.599s] different ways all point to the same
[2784.599s] thing but nothing more important than
[2786.72s] the year of the snake and the silly
[2788.88s] calendar from clsa a record number of us
[2792.68s] companies changed their CEOs last year
[2795.2s] which gave us what opportunity Mana from
[2798.52s] heaven for turnaround Tom easy pickings
[2801.559s] to find unbelievable opportunities which
[2803.48s] is usually one of the key catalysts
[2805.64s] after we get through solvency risk after
[2807.96s] we get through uh buying it at a price
[2810.64s] that would insult the board we we look
[2813.24s] for Catalyst for Change and usually in a
[2816.24s] turnaround situation the Catalyst uh for
[2818.68s] change is going to be a new CEO whether
[2821.599s] it&#39;s Brack and Daryl at
[2823.76s] vfc um some of them are just cyclical
[2826.64s] and you have to wait out like Cooper
[2828.04s] standard uh baba got a new
[2830.88s] CEO
[2833.319s] um and on and on so
[2837.559s] um moving along 10-year government bond
[2841.0s] yield again I think this peaked out here
[2843.559s] this
[2844.92s] week same with 30 we went through this
[2848.92s] chart S&amp;P erases post elction rally this
[2852.4s] is kind of interesting what happened and
[2854.28s] if you actually did equal weight
[2856.319s] probably even more so uh that was an
[2858.92s] Abrupt pause in December which is going
[2861.8s] to refresh moving forward performance of
[2864.16s] global Renewables and ESG favorites uh
[2867.92s] absolute terrible there&#39;s probably some
[2869.52s] opportunity there actual SNP earnings
[2873.319s] growth has exceeded expectations in the
[2876.119s] last few years
[2877.64s] so we&#39;re expecting 8% earnings growth
[2880.44s] this quarter is probably going to come
[2881.64s] in 11 or
[2883.68s] 12 um and then uh this continues to ramp
[2887.44s] up 11% 11% 15% and 177% we&#39;ll see how
[2890.88s] that holds up concentration we covered
[2893.72s] that here is the fed&#39;s model valuation
[2897.16s] Edge evaporates as bond yields Spike
[2899.92s] this is critical ladies and Gentlemen
[2902.839s] people are talking about the equity risk
[2905.72s] premium being so
[2908.24s] low earnings yield minus 10year treasury
[2913.319s] yield as bearish meaning expected
[2917.44s] returns for the next 10 years you&#39;re
[2918.96s] getting all these people coming back out
[2921.079s] talking about the next loss decade as
[2923.0s] they were for the last decade what this
[2926.92s] points to this how this got so skewed is
[2930.52s] the multiples of the mag 7 which have
[2933.68s] not yet rated down consistent with their
[2936.4s] earning deceleration being derated down
[2939.64s] and that creates the opportunity of a
[2941.28s] lifetime for the 493 for emerging
[2945.04s] markets for international for small caps
[2949.48s] uh that will benefit from the reating of
[2952.799s] the concentrated which has brought the
[2954.24s] equity risk premium down so the equity
[2955.92s] risk premium is probably at the worst
[2958.96s] point that it&#39;s been in 25 years if you
[2961.4s] own those concentrated basket of stocks
[2964.079s] and it couldn&#39;t be better if you&#39;re
[2966.0s] buying in in the areas that we&#39;re buying
[2968.4s] which is why we have such a low
[2969.799s] correlation to the overall S&amp;P and
[2972.28s] that&#39;s a good thing right now what do
[2974.119s] you think the return on the S&amp;P 500 will
[2976.44s] be in
[2977.52s] 2025 uh the bulk of folks uh pointed
[2982.319s] to 5 to 10% I think that&#39;s reasonable
[2986.079s] that goes back to what Peter theal said
[2989.24s] you don&#39;t have to be a contrarian I
[2990.76s] happen to agree with consensus right now
[2994.2s] uh and then you&#39;ve got the taals around
[2996.24s] 0 to 5 and 10 to 15 and I think anywhere
[3000.44s] in that range of you know call it 8 to
[3003.119s] 12% is a reasonable expectation because
[3006.559s] I don&#39;t think that concentrated basket&#39;s
[3008.839s] going to do well and even if the rest of
[3011.319s] the basket does exceptionally well which
[3013.0s] we think it
[3014.0s] will um it won&#39;t be reflected because of
[3016.88s] the current small weights this reminds
[3019.2s] me of the period in 2020 when energy got
[3024.04s] down to like 2% of the S&amp;P weight down
[3026.76s] from8 or 9 or 10 and every week I&#39;d go
[3029.2s] on when we were buying Exxon at $33 or
[3032.76s] whatever it was um pounding the table
[3036.72s] like this is not going to continue
[3038.4s] ladies and gentlemen everything that you
[3040.28s] use has energy in it uh in addition to
[3043.319s] your car and uh and sure enough that was
[3047.24s] just a monster home run S&amp;P 500
[3050.359s] concentration median uh PE
[3053.96s] again nothing like this going all the
[3056.48s] way back to
[3058.599s] the top and the
[3062.28s] nifty50 um us has a valuation at its
[3065.2s] 20-year Peak and this remains true even
[3067.76s] if we exclude the largest technology
[3069.64s] companies uh which is why we like the
[3071.92s] international we like the small cap we
[3073.68s] like everything setting up here whereas
[3075.68s] China is on the low end of his historic
[3077.559s] valuation you can&#39;t give away China
[3079.319s] people can&#39;t get enough what what was
[3080.96s] the note this year this this week from
[3083.04s] Goldman us exceptionalism to continue
[3085.44s] only bu US stocks well last year what
[3087.92s] they said was they were the lowest
[3089.839s] Target on the street at
[3091.52s] 5400 uh for 2024 and they were 100%
[3094.76s] wrong they&#39;re basically implying no
[3096.16s] gains in 2024 they got it wrong this
[3099.359s] year they&#39;re they&#39;re saying crowd into
[3101.4s] what&#39;s already risen and they&#39;re going
[3103.04s] to be wrong again uh S&amp;P 500 quarterly
[3106.28s] EPS forecast so you can see here 133%
[3110.119s] next year uh interest rate cutting
[3112.52s] Cycles have generally been associated
[3114.079s] with Rising Equity prices so long as a
[3116.04s] recession is avoided we believe a
[3117.96s] recession already happened in 2022 they
[3120.88s] tend to happen every 4.1 years which
[3123.68s] means we front-loaded 8.2 years of
[3125.88s] recessions into two years between 2020
[3128.28s] and 22 which should imply we&#39;ve got
[3130.839s] another four plus years six total from
[3133.76s] the last recession to
[3137.16s] um to potentially be recession free we
[3140.799s] will keep an eye on the data but when
[3142.079s] you have GDP estimates 2.5 to3
[3144.92s] consistently coming out and earnings
[3146.319s] growth grow in the double digits very
[3147.599s] hard to have a recession ladies and
[3149.16s] gentlemen so in that case with no
[3151.44s] recession uh we could be seeing some
[3154.96s] materially uh uh improved and positive
[3158.64s] Equity prices realized and consensus EPS
[3161.92s] growth for select we covered that City
[3164.319s] Group economic surprise index turning
[3166.28s] back up that&#39;s
[3169.119s] good
[3170.96s] uh here are the charts so as you can see
[3182.24s] oh interesting my bad ladies and
[3186.16s] gentlemen uh wall Street&#39;s 2024 year end
[3189.68s] price targets Goldman was not at
[3191.64s] 5400 Goldman was at
[3197.599s] 5100 no that was 2023 okay so they were
[3200.559s] 5400 for
[3202.24s] 2024 uh here are the growth versus
[3207.88s] value just a friendly reminder ladies
[3210.64s] and gentlemen uh when conditions were
[3213.04s] set up the way that they are now for the
[3215.599s] next six consecutive years from 2000 to
[3219.599s] 2006 value outperformed growth by 29% in
[3224.04s] 2000 14% in 2022 12% in
[3227.72s] 2023 U uh 30 basis points
[3230.72s] [Music]
[3232.16s] in the next year 10% in 202 4 1.8% in
[3238.119s] 2025 133% in 2026 and that&#39;s the norm
[3243.119s] this is the exception zero interest rate
[3245.28s] policy then going back to the 80s when
[3247.28s] Reagan was in most years value
[3249.64s] outperformed growth 81 83 84 86
[3258.319s] 88 growth relative to Value again going
[3261.319s] back to the
[3264.359s] top large caps to small caps again going
[3267.319s] back
[3267.96s] to.com so if you&#39;re not buying the right
[3272.2s] thing at these extremes then you
[3275.96s] are
[3278.319s] um what can I I the way I would put it
[3285.04s] is if you&#39;re not a student of History
[3288.24s] you will miss a lot of the generational
[3291.48s] opportunities and what a lot of smart
[3293.839s] business people do is they allocate
[3296.04s] people who do to to people who do this
[3299.0s] for a living that see these things and
[3301.52s] that have the ice in their veins to sit
[3303.72s] through you know this is not a easy
[3307.76s] period to sit through but then you don&#39;t
[3309.559s] get the benefit of this regime change if
[3312.64s] you&#39;re unable to sit through and and the
[3314.64s] way that you&#39;re able to sit through is
[3316.079s] doing your work and and having the
[3317.799s] confidence because you&#39;ve done your work
[3319.28s] and you understand what&#39;s going on and
[3320.96s] then being on low leverage so you can
[3322.359s] sit through the short-term volatility to
[3324.079s] the long-term rewards you cannot have
[3327.48s] excess outperformance over time without
[3330.28s] short-term volatility ites it&#39;s just
[3332.28s] it&#39;s just the the scales of Justice you
[3334.52s] know you you got to trade one for the
[3335.839s] other if you want excess outperformance
[3338.079s] uh in the long term you have to have
[3340.079s] short-term volatility in the short term
[3342.039s] and the way that you get through
[3342.96s] short-term volatility in the short term
[3344.4s] is number one you&#39;ve done your work so
[3345.76s] you have confidence and number two uh
[3348.039s] low to no leverage and if you have those
[3349.799s] two things in place then you get the
[3351.16s] excess over time uh which is what we try
[3354.039s] to do here which is why we have such a
[3355.319s] low correlation to P versus 99% of
[3357.96s] managers being closet indexers charging
[3360.24s] you for something that you can get for
[3361.599s] free uh by being in index funds at the
[3364.039s] exact wrong time when passive indexes
[3367.079s] indexing has hit an all-time high at the
[3369.839s] exact wrong time when concentration is
[3371.599s] at an all-time high which every time
[3373.599s] it&#39;s done that we know what happens next
[3376.28s] so um here is another chart from Charlie
[3381.319s] Bello uh not only doing the value versus
[3385.0s] growth doing S&amp;P 500 versus xus
[3389.68s] International stocks and again this Zer
[3392.599s] environment has been the exception not
[3395.28s] the rule exception not the rule so
[3397.72s] unless you believe we&#39;re going back to
[3399.359s] zero interest rate policy uh you do not
[3402.96s] want to be overweight us uh relative to
[3405.839s] International you do not want to be
[3407.359s] overweight growth relative to
[3408.88s] International now does that flip in 2025
[3411.4s] guaranteed I think it probably does do
[3413.96s] we know if it&#39;s 2025 2026 or 2027
[3417.44s] we don&#39;t but what we buy is has a large
[3420.799s] enough margin of safety that we&#39;re we&#39;re
[3423.24s] perfectly comfortable uh taking the asym
[3426.4s] asymmetric trade now because once it
[3429.68s] goes it doesn&#39;t go like oh you get one
[3432.2s] year and a checkback it goes for streaks
[3435.44s] 2002 International outperformed domestic
[3438.92s] 6.6% 2003 11.3% 2004 10% International
[3443.88s] better than us 2005 10 % International
[3447.16s] better than us 2006 10% International
[3450.28s] better than us 2007 International 7.4%
[3454.359s] better than us returns and then early
[3456.319s] &#39;90s same thing 80s during 70s basically
[3460.079s] the Whole Decade 71 72 73 74 while us
[3463.319s] was crashing International was doing
[3464.599s] better same with
[3466.16s] 7778 and then during Reagan 8 second
[3468.839s] term 85 86 87 88 all meaningful
[3473.2s] outperformance in &#39; 86 International
[3475.52s] outperform Med Us by
[3478.319s] 44% these are not one-offs these when
[3482.039s] this this turns it turns and it doesn&#39;t
[3484.64s] look back for many many years value
[3487.4s] versus growth and to as a friendly
[3489.76s] reminder uh um value has outperformed
[3492.96s] growth by 4.4% per year since
[3496.76s] 1927 including this zero interest rate
[3500.4s] policy aberration where it&#39;s funny I was
[3504.039s] joking with someone yesterday uh
[3506.68s] uh
[3508.68s] um they had this 10year they had this
[3512.68s] computer model that they thought they
[3514.359s] could beat the markets and uh I said
[3517.839s] well how far does it back test they&#39;re
[3519.799s] like well only 10 years I&#39;m like okay
[3523.039s] well in the in the last 10 years that
[3525.48s] you&#39;ve predicated the model upon um let
[3529.2s] me tell you what&#39;s taking place okay
[3532.24s] prior to the last 10 years if you said
[3534.599s] to me Tom
[3537.799s] here&#39;s some moneyy to manage I&#39;d like
[3540.24s] you to lose 90% of the money as fast as
[3544.079s] humanly possible I would have said to
[3546.28s] you that&#39;s so easy here&#39;s all I need to
[3548.68s] do I&#39;m going to buy a basket of 20
[3552.599s] stocks that are all trading above 10
[3555.24s] time sales and making no money and I
[3558.079s] guarantee you I will lose 90% of your
[3560.48s] money in three years and every other
[3565.079s] decade
[3567.079s] prior to
[3568.28s] 2010 if you had bought a basket at 10 at
[3571.319s] you know 10 20 30 stocks all trading at
[3573.96s] greater than 10 times sales all making
[3576.079s] no money you would have lost 90% of your
[3578.28s] money within a matter of a few years
[3580.2s] that that is a guaranteed way to lose
[3582.119s] money except during the one decade in
[3585.76s] history when you had zero interest rate
[3588.559s] policy for the first time that actually
[3593.119s] outperformed the S&amp;P 500 losing money
[3597.039s] trading at 10 times sales okay so 2022
[3601.839s] when they all got roasted uh and and we
[3605.16s] were you know buying Google in the hole
[3609.76s] in in Fall of 2022 buying Amazon in the
[3612.96s] whole in Fall of 2022 and making easy
[3615.44s] doubles um those folks got roasted so
[3618.359s] that was a preview of Coming Attractions
[3620.44s] when the carry trade on wines these
[3623.0s] these folks are going to get shellacked
[3625.319s] okay so what I can tell you is beware of
[3630.28s] recency bias because you will make false
[3634.0s] assumptions deadly false assumptions on
[3636.68s] the basis of what&#39;s happened in the
[3638.079s] short term and what over over a
[3640.599s] reasonable framework when you zoom out
[3643.079s] is guaranteed to cause permanent
[3646.079s] irreversible damage um so that&#39;s that
[3650.24s] here&#39;s another thing for my folks over
[3653.359s] at
[3654.68s] uh uh in Cork&#39;s class who I know listen
[3658.039s] every week and I&#39;m going to go speak to
[3660.16s] this uh group of students in early
[3663.64s] February uh here&#39;s what you have the SNP
[3667.559s] to International stocks uh from 1970 to
[3673.44s] 2024 the us out performer performance is
[3677.319s] three standard deviations above the mean
[3680.88s] so do you want to bet on it going
[3683.76s] to four standard iations or do you want
[3688.079s] to play the reversion like in 2000 and
[3691.76s] 2001 like in 1984 under Reagan like in
[3696.599s] 76 like in 70 where if you got out of
[3701.24s] the us when you were at this extreme and
[3703.319s] started to get some International
[3705.839s] exposure you dramatically outperformed
[3709.0s] for the next not one not two not three
[3712.16s] usually five six seven consecutive years
[3715.559s] I will take that asymmetry all day long
[3718.48s] and I continue to say for those getting
[3720.799s] started and those who have been with me
[3723.559s] um what Co created is a once in a 100e
[3728.24s] opportunity uh where it just the the
[3732.279s] opportunities have created will not
[3734.72s] replicate in my lifetime in the way that
[3737.92s] they are from what we&#39;re seeing right
[3739.48s] now um and we are positioned to take
[3742.839s] advantage of them here&#39;s another way of
[3744.279s] looking Emerging Markets to s P again
[3747.119s] going back
[3748.24s] so there you go hiring blue past
[3751.0s] expectations with 256,000 jobs added
[3753.4s] into December so that was the Catalyst
[3755.88s] for people saying no Cuts or hikes are
[3757.96s] coming in
[3762.88s] 2020 uh five which will prove to be
[3766.96s] incorrect non-farm payrolls the growth
[3769.359s] was in healthc care and social
[3771.039s] assistance the contraction was in
[3772.599s] manufacturing that is going to change
[3774.359s] under Trump that also has something to
[3775.96s] do with Automation and Robotics but um
[3779.48s] we&#39;ll see how that plays out uh consumer
[3781.559s] sentiment index
[3783.52s] Rose economic conditions Rose we got a
[3787.16s] lot of data this week inflation
[3789.4s] expectations Rose after the jobs
[3791.72s] report that&#39;s what hurt yields that&#39;s
[3794.559s] changed after the PPI and CPI ppi is a
[3797.52s] leading
[3799.119s] indicator here was the implied
[3801.4s] probability of a raid hike you saw it
[3802.96s] Spike up after uh December and January
[3806.48s] that&#39;s now probably rolling over Chinese
[3808.52s] Trade Surplus is at a trillion
[3811.079s] dollars that&#39;ll normalize as the Yuan
[3814.599s] strengthens number of stocks and
[3816.52s] uptrends continues to dwindle they say
[3819.359s] that like it&#39;s a bearish thing that&#39;s
[3820.92s] usually a bullish thing what you see
[3822.52s] closer to Bottoms than tops uh S&amp;P 500
[3825.92s] members greater than the 50-day moving
[3828.0s] average again it&#39;s like a bearish thing
[3830.279s] it&#39;s not a bearish thing this is what
[3831.599s] you see at bottoms like in the fall of
[3834.16s] 2023 turning the with the cyclical
[3836.599s] rebound this is from Bank of America
[3838.0s] December likely marked the beginning of
[3839.279s] a cyclical Rebound in manufacturing
[3841.319s] which has been in a downturn for over 2
[3843.359s] years longest in history with half of
[3845.559s] the
[3846.319s] S&amp;P uh earnings tied to manufacturing
[3849.4s] the cyclical rebound should lead to
[3851.48s] volume growth driving better operational
[3853.319s] leverage and margins 67% of companies
[3855.92s] are expected to post positive EPS growth
[3858.079s] similar to last quarter but that is
[3859.839s] expected to
[3860.92s] improve uh to
[3863.64s] 95% by Q4 of
[3866.64s] 2025 moreover a record which is a record
[3869.839s] high uh moreover albeit still slow over
[3872.68s] 25% of companies are expected to outpace
[3875.16s] the mag 7&#39;s earnings growth by Q3 2025
[3878.88s] versus the low of 8% that is huge ladies
[3882.16s] and gentlemen let me repeat that over
[3884.079s] 25% of companies are expected to outpace
[3886.24s] the mag 7 zps growth by 3Q 2025 versus
[3889.96s] the low of 8%
[3892.279s] so three times as many companies are
[3895.279s] going to
[3896.72s] outpace uh the S&amp;P mag the mag 7even
[3900.52s] earnings then did at the low uh just a
[3904.319s] short time ago consensus expects 9%
[3906.64s] earnings growth in the fourth quarter
[3907.92s] we&#39;ll probably get
[3909.119s] 11% you can see here
[3911.65s] [Music]
[3914.799s] where that is lightweight vehicle SAR
[3919.72s] versus Domestic Auto inventory you can
[3922.72s] see
[3924.44s] here the inventories are still low this
[3927.559s] looks very much
[3929.599s] like
[3931.359s] um both the 2000 when Charlie made his
[3936.72s] fortune on Teno which was the
[3938.4s] inspiration for our Cooper standard
[3940.88s] trade you get these collapses off of
[3943.599s] high levels and then these recoveries
[3947.48s] and then 2009 is a closer example where
[3950.72s] you got this kind of double you know
[3953.039s] absolute catastrophic collapse like we
[3955.279s] we had during covid and then you start
[3957.359s] to take off a little check back before
[3959.24s] the absolute parabolic move uh up as
[3963.079s] inventories catch up to SAR and that&#39;s
[3966.039s] where we are there durable goods orders
[3968.559s] minus Motor Vehicles versus inventory
[3971.68s] same type of thing you saw in 08 and 09
[3973.64s] before a huge run in Auto Part suppliers
[3976.64s] consensus expects 67% of companies to
[3979.119s] grow EPS year on-ear in Q4 same as Q3
[3983.359s] but 95% by Q Q4 2025
[3988.76s] 95% earnings of components growing
[3991.839s] earnings by Q4 of this year which speaks
[3994.72s] to the broadening over a quarter of
[3997.079s] stocks are expected to outgrow EPS
[3999.0s] versus the mag 7 Up from 8% off the lows
[4002.599s] so you can see these type of Cycles last
[4004.72s] time you had it was uh the end of covid
[4008.359s] and then prior to that 2017 and sure
[4010.839s] enough you get the broadening coming
[4012.44s] back in a material way here&#39;s another
[4014.4s] way to look at it in terms of earnings
[4016.52s] and here&#39;s another sector by sector you
[4019.359s] can see here where the earnings growth
[4021.72s] is going to start to kick in materially
[4023.359s] is Health Care uh uh materials is going
[4026.599s] to be huge in the back half of next year
[4029.48s] Industrials huge back half of next year
[4032.279s] energy all the things that you can&#39;t
[4034.0s] give away right now so that&#39;s exciting
[4035.64s] here&#39;s the dstock cycle to the restock
[4038.24s] cycle just like in the early 2000s huge
[4040.92s] move up off the lows then a check back
[4043.0s] and then a final move same thing here
[4045.52s] semis and a saw the biggest destocking
[4048.64s] year over-year
[4050.48s] so now we&#39;re into the restock cycle
[4053.52s] build those inventories back up get the
[4055.319s] incentives going Off to the Races Capa
[4058.16s] growth just accelerated for non mag 7 PL
[4062.88s] for the first time since 3Q
[4066.96s] 2022
[4070.319s] uh so that&#39;s a positive sign and we were
[4074.0s] talking about that earlier
[4076.359s] CEOs expecting higher capex over the
[4078.559s] next six months so CEO confidence is
[4081.559s] coming back rail Freight carloads still
[4084.119s] okay Korean experts exports still okay
[4087.119s] those are leading
[4088.319s] indicators uh this has been the most
[4091.48s] rate sensitive manufacturing cycle in
[4093.72s] history so you see it going all the way
[4096.159s] back to when to
[4098.159s] 2001 uh and then straight up after that
[4101.56s] and I think we&#39;re going to see a similar
[4102.88s] thing which will be good for what for
[4104.92s] value versus growth January to February
[4107.359s] has seasonally been the weakest guidance
[4109.56s] period um so we&#39;ll we&#39;ll see how that
[4112.159s] guidance plays out in coming
[4114.239s] weeks corporate sentiment remains strong
[4117.839s] uh corporate sentiment has historically
[4119.64s] LED quarterly EPS growth by a quarter so
[4121.92s] that&#39;s a good thing to see reporting by
[4124.199s] week the biggest week is going to be the
[4126.279s] January 27th to the 31st and then the
[4130.0s] first week of February we&#39;re just
[4131.96s] ramping up moving into next week will be
[4135.96s] kind of like this week but the big week
[4137.56s] is the week after
[4139.04s] that here is an update from Baxter they
[4143.4s] spoke at the JP Morgan healthc care
[4145.48s] conference preliminary guidance
[4147.04s] anticipate sales growth of 4 to 5%
[4149.199s] adjusted operating margin of 16.5
[4152.04s] restarting the North Cove facility which
[4154.48s] was hit by the
[4155.759s] hurricane
[4156.81s] [Music]
[4159.52s] um and
[4161.679s] obviously uh sale of the kidney business
[4164.279s] to carile ear 2025 q1 2025 proceeds of
[4168.48s] about 3.2 billion to be used exclusively
[4172.799s] for debt reduction reinvestment and
[4175.56s] potential share
[4179.92s] BuyBacks uh so that&#39;s going to be a
[4181.799s] catalyst for reating because the kidney
[4183.52s] business was the slowest grower and as
[4186.319s] they get earnings growth back uh and uh
[4189.719s] debt deleveraging and interest expense
[4192.0s] down uh we&#39;ll see a multiple expansion
[4194.679s] and get that stock Off to the Races
[4196.679s] which is exciting moving
[4199.28s] along small business optimism turning up
[4202.28s] producer prices
[4203.8s] cooling all things we want to see that&#39;s
[4206.239s] a leading indicator uh BuyBacks announce
[4209.199s] BuyBacks what&#39;s the biggest sector is
[4212.04s] healthc care energy financials and
[4214.199s] Staples are having the biggest BuyBacks
[4217.08s] whereas in backward looking it had been
[4221.12s] Tech here&#39;s from Seth golden one thing
[4223.96s] we should anticipated in investors
[4225.64s] Traders from the high valuations is
[4227.12s] bigger pullbacks when valuations in the
[4229.239s] 9 to 10% desile top desiles correction
[4231.76s] probabilities increase
[4233.28s] sharply 80% probability of 10%
[4236.28s] correction 98% of a 5% pullback so yeah
[4240.48s] and and they&#39;re going to be concentrated
[4242.32s] in where those areas that you have
[4244.12s] concentration here&#39;s 52 we lows this
[4246.84s] people look at as bearish it&#39;s it&#39;s
[4248.719s] usually what you see near short-term
[4251.199s] bottoms uh General road map for 2025
[4254.159s] this is from Larry
[4257.32s] Williams who&#39;s been pretty hot the last
[4259.719s] couple of years uh up and down over the
[4263.04s] last 40 but he&#39;s been doing it for a
[4265.56s] while this is his cycle analysis which
[4268.08s] points to uh little bit of weakness
[4271.719s] going into early February and then
[4273.36s] straight up through the rest of the year
[4274.64s] we&#39;ll see if that proves to be the
[4277.199s] correct uh here we go on the slomer
[4282.6s] slides we got two sler from
[4285.8s] RBC thanks to my buddy over
[4292.52s] there so it&#39;s showing momentum turning
[4295.159s] back up on the
[4296.84s] S&amp;P bond yields topping out getting
[4300.52s] overbought dollar topping out losing
[4303.12s] momentum all the things that we&#39;re
[4304.88s] talking about again just a different way
[4306.4s] to look at it these are the things you
[4309.32s] check yourself before you wreck yourself
[4311.04s] you know I mean you you look at every
[4312.84s] possible way to analyze and stress test
[4316.84s] your
[4317.719s] framework uh and the more ways you can
[4319.76s] stress test it the higher confidence
[4322.639s] level you can do and then you always
[4324.36s] manage risk uh for something that you
[4326.84s] don&#39;t know that you don&#39;t know or a
[4328.12s] Black Swan so no matter what happens uh
[4330.76s] you live another day for the recovery
[4332.88s] and then the follow through and then the
[4334.639s] outsize returns over time uh and that&#39;s
[4338.0s] that&#39;s the name of the game here is the
[4339.76s] S&amp;P 500 bouncing after that uh uh
[4343.84s] inflation report and then momentum
[4345.6s] turning up same thing with yields
[4347.96s] rolling over
[4351.199s] dollar small caps and midcaps up against
[4354.4s] this trend
[4355.8s] line uh small caps breaking out is going
[4358.4s] to be the big story of 2025 in the US
[4360.92s] that is international outperforming is
[4363.239s] going to be the other big story that no
[4364.52s] one&#39;s prepared for no one&#39;s even talking
[4366.159s] about preparing for they&#39;ve just
[4367.84s] forgotten all about International which
[4369.88s] is the perfect time to be getting
[4371.56s] involved industrial is bouncing up
[4376.28s] and then what do we have here smart
[4378.0s] money buying and selling activities this
[4381.199s] is
[4384.04s] the what you see at lows on the
[4387.28s] indices they&#39;ve been selling in the hole
[4389.679s] which is what they do every single time
[4391.28s] hedge fund hedge funds are the most
[4393.48s] bullish on the dollar since 2019 we know
[4396.52s] what happens after they get overweight
[4399.719s] uh you tend to get a reversal everyone&#39;s
[4401.4s] crowded into one side of the boat
[4409.36s] uh after the 1973 nifty50 draw down the
[4412.84s] average stock recovered in half of the
[4414.8s] time the ones that got smoked that
[4417.159s] didn&#39;t recover for a long time were uh
[4419.96s] the
[4420.76s] concentrated um nifty50 the top handful
[4424.12s] of Weights in that index took many years
[4426.6s] to recover whereas the rest of the
[4427.96s] market recovered very very quickly
[4430.4s] dollar sentiment index is at a high at
[4432.76s] the same high that you see at all the
[4434.44s] previous p
[4436.52s] uh
[4438.08s] gold after US dollar rally sentiment
[4440.76s] exceeds this is gold sentiment so good
[4443.32s] luck with that uh instances where Vic&#39;s
[4446.4s] one-day percentage change is greater
[4448.239s] than 60% and S&amp;P for and S&amp;P 500
[4452.239s] performance so this is from fun
[4455.0s] Strat he&#39;s
[4457.76s] implying that the S&amp;P could recover to
[4462.36s] 6500 by mid-February based on this I
[4465.32s] think this is
[4467.8s] um tenuous possible but tenuous not
[4471.88s] enough of a data sample to draw strong
[4474.6s] confidence uh conclusions but I think
[4477.159s] the the direction is correct uh and I
[4479.719s] think a lot of people were not position
[4481.32s] to that going for that going into the
[4484.4s] inflation prints that started things
[4487.719s] moving in the right
[4490.4s] direction and speaking of which
[4497.4s] yeah and today as well that&#39;s exciting
[4499.639s] all right spreads as a percentage of
[4501.04s] yield our near record
[4502.88s] lows these levels have not been seen
[4505.6s] since before the financial crisis look
[4507.92s] this is what you see for many many years
[4510.719s] these are a trend uh you can have
[4513.96s] hiccups like we saw in
[4516.719s] 2023 but this can last for many many
[4519.639s] years uh spreads contract after having a
[4522.159s] heart attack like we saw in covid
[4526.44s] 2020 I had a friend who was so
[4530.96s] bearish in 20 in the hole in 2022 and he
[4536.36s] basically sold everything in the hole he
[4537.719s] didn&#39;t admit it but that&#39;s what he did
[4539.88s] because he said that this was going to
[4541.679s] spike right back up and he showed me all
[4543.56s] these examples where it spiked right
[4545.04s] back up and I said that I&#39;m telling you
[4546.88s] this is the time to be buying not
[4548.159s] selling you know Market&#39;s already down
[4549.76s] 25% buy everything and uh um he took the
[4554.52s] other side trade so
[4556.52s] anyway you just have to be burdened by
[4558.96s] history none of these things are
[4560.36s] guaranteed he could have been right but
[4562.8s] the underlying fundamentals didn&#39;t
[4564.679s] support that view and that&#39;s why we were
[4567.4s] buyers versus sellers in the whole
[4569.239s] United States producers uh prices final
[4571.6s] demand Less Foods and
[4574.28s] energy this is a collapse I mean this is
[4576.719s] good this is a leading indicator as well
[4579.199s] hyperscaler capex growth this is what I
[4581.48s] was talking about ladies and gentlemen
[4583.84s] uh the annual capex growth is declining
[4588.88s] from 50% growth last year to 21% growth
[4594.04s] this year which is coincident with the
[4597.48s] earnings growth
[4599.32s] deceleration next 12 month PE okay you
[4602.88s] can see mid caps versus 493 versus S&amp;P
[4606.48s] versus small caps we&#39;ve covered annual
[4609.08s] earnings growth you could see here the
[4611.36s] Magnificent 7 in Blue uh next is
[4614.239s] dropping from
[4615.6s] 3
[4617.52s] 33% down to
[4619.56s] 18% S&amp;P 493 is going from 3% last year
[4623.239s] to 11% next year this year to 133% next
[4626.639s] year whereas mag 7 is 33 last year 18
[4629.96s] this year 16 next year one&#39;s going up
[4632.639s] one&#39;s going down where do you want to be
[4634.52s] where do you think you&#39;re going to see
[4635.36s] multiple contraction where do you think
[4636.92s] you&#39;re going to see multiple expansion
[4639.0s] can&#39;t reemphasize this enough and and I
[4642.679s] haven&#39;t reemphasized this enough
[4645.719s] um only 50 times every week for the last
[4648.4s] few weeks uh let&#39;s see here
[4652.48s] revenues foreign
[4655.719s] revenues exposure by sector this is
[4658.44s] pretty interesting the S&amp;P 500 has 28%
[4662.159s] exposure so you may see some short-term
[4665.239s] headwinds from the dollar being strong
[4667.36s] in Q4 that&#39;s something to keep in mind
[4669.36s] that&#39;ll probably impact guidance as well
[4672.239s] which is interesting because guidance is
[4673.92s] weakest in Janu January and
[4675.84s] February uh we covered
[4680.4s] this Sensi of sales growth to changes in
[4684.84s] US
[4688.28s] dollar B
[4690.44s] sector number of months with consecutive
[4693.04s] payroll gains since 1939 with a positive
[4696.12s] December 20 this cycle will move into
[4698.4s] the second longest period
[4702.08s] of consecutive job gains
[4705.679s] not stuff you generally see during a
[4708.4s] recession uh we covered the household
[4710.36s] and service you can see the Japanese
[4712.52s] topics uh breaking this whatever they
[4716.08s] call this a bare flag uh for all the
[4718.92s] technicians out
[4720.4s] there this is key Trump team studies
[4723.92s] gradual tariff hikes under emergency
[4727.04s] Powers this is a big deal uh and the
[4730.239s] market liked this when this headline
[4731.84s] came out gradual versus all at once that
[4734.199s] gives them average power you know if
[4735.719s] they go up 2% every month for 10 months
[4737.719s] every month they ratchet up the heat
[4739.52s] bring them to the table so maybe they
[4741.12s] don&#39;t have to go to the full 20% and uh
[4744.48s] the second thing that they talked about
[4746.0s] was targeting certain industries versus
[4748.0s] blanket which is also a positive thing
[4750.199s] you can tell bessent is hard at work uh
[4752.8s] providing a level of rationality Rock
[4755.92s] Bottom valuations imply plenty of upside
[4758.12s] when sentiment improves this is emerging
[4760.48s] markets in
[4761.719s] Brazil uh this one&#39;s particularly to
[4764.28s] talk targeted at emerging markets in
[4766.28s] Brazil again one more data point
[4769.32s] confirming what we&#39;ve been talking
[4771.4s] about uh the level of oversold be which
[4775.0s] preceded every single previous massive
[4777.56s] rally in emerging markets and Brazil
[4780.36s] equal weight versus S&amp;P 500 bottoming
[4782.719s] and turning up this is a positive thing
[4785.159s] just like we saw in the summer that
[4787.0s] happened that continued all the way till
[4788.88s] December then we took a break now we&#39;re
[4790.76s] recovering
[4795.0s] Traders brace for biggest S&amp;P earnings
[4798.239s] day reactions
[4801.08s] ever uh S&amp;P 600 around election days so
[4805.6s] this has been weaker than normal I think
[4807.159s] we&#39;ll get a catch up on the S&amp;P 600
[4809.84s] here&#39;s the Russell 2000 down to its
[4811.8s] 50-day moving average ready to bounce
[4813.8s] off we think that&#39;s imminent stocks have
[4816.12s] been riding a wave of liquidity you can
[4818.159s] see how that targets there I think that
[4820.84s] liquidity is going to be a function of
[4823.32s] the Japanese carry trade which when that
[4825.48s] starts to the air starts to come out the
[4827.76s] air is going to come out of the
[4829.159s] concentrated stocks we&#39;ve talked about
[4830.96s] stocks have historically done better
[4832.76s] under reelected presidents early in
[4834.76s] their second terms so average return is
[4841.199s] 99.6% uh which I think is right in The
[4843.32s] Sweet Spot of what we&#39;re looking for for
[4844.8s] the indices this year I think we&#39;re
[4846.199s] going to see Fortunes in the non-
[4848.36s] indices this year and I think we&#39;re set
[4850.6s] up extremely well for
[4852.84s] that PPI truckload Bank of America
[4855.76s] truckload demand indicator versus ISM
[4858.32s] truckloads turning
[4860.4s] up predictive of ISM Manufacturing
[4863.48s] turning up predictive of everything else
[4865.6s] that we&#39;ve been talking about consensus
[4867.36s] on the bonds is too bearish contrarily
[4869.96s] not supported of further rise in bond
[4871.8s] yields small retailer sentiment on
[4874.32s] Treasury bonds selling in the whole just
[4876.32s] like they do on every single turn turn
[4880.88s] turning point once you got the retail
[4883.28s] sentiment super bearish bonds that&#39;s
[4885.199s] when you get the recovery and you can
[4886.6s] see it looking back to
[4888.44s] 2015 uh same thing with the dollar
[4891.56s] consensus dollar is too bullish
[4893.12s] contrarily not supportive of a further
[4894.84s] rise in the dollar
[4897.239s] whose hand over fist bullish hedge funds
[4900.28s] and small retailer Traders are more
[4902.8s] bullish on the dollar than they&#39;ve ever
[4904.12s] been which points to a roll over small
[4907.28s] business optimism index taking
[4910.88s] off uh you can see the uh stocks losing
[4915.92s] momentum due to Dollar strength while
[4917.4s] dollar is now going to weaken which is
[4919.719s] going to be good for equities and
[4923.12s] then uh Tech position is vulnerable as
[4926.52s] it again significantly above levels
[4928.679s] implied by earnings growth with gap
[4930.12s] similar to that scene in early July
[4932.44s] ahead of the two Q2 earnings season
[4934.44s] right before we had the rotation so
[4936.28s] again another way to look at the same
[4937.92s] thing that we&#39;re looking at check
[4939.44s] yourself before you wreck yourself cross
[4941.159s] check everything here&#39;s TLT and what you
[4944.0s] see is bond market shorts are about to
[4946.4s] get squeezed a rally in bonds is bullish
[4949.08s] for stocks so you can see here this
[4951.56s] level of extreme not seen for many years
[4954.56s] and which preceded rallies or at least
[4957.8s] short-term B bounce backs but definitely
[4959.679s] rallies in bonds and TLT short interest
[4963.08s] is at all-time highs and these folks are
[4965.4s] going to get their tases squeeze
[4971.239s] City Goldman Sachs Chief Economist
[4973.639s] expects Trump to slap 20% extra tariffs
[4977.04s] on most Chinese Goods on average only uh
[4980.239s] not the 60% as advertised Intel stock
[4982.6s] has been beaten down how a new CEO could
[4984.76s] shake things up they also um are
[4987.32s] separating their Venture Capital arm
[4989.199s] that&#39;s been a division since 1991 can
[4992.44s] Doge really Slash 2 trillion musk is now
[4995.12s] talking about 1 trillion which is good
[4997.52s] from uh both an inflation and a
[5000.04s] deflation standpoint 2 trillion might
[5001.52s] have been deflationary 1 trillion is the
[5003.08s] right number um uh China&#39;s Central Bank
[5006.12s] beefs up support of the Yuan near
[5007.92s] 16-month low same thing at 2017 which we
[5011.48s] covered Hershey seeks new CEO with
[5013.56s] Michelle Buck departing next year that
[5015.48s] is a positive Catalyst we have our eye
[5017.36s] on that stock we&#39;ve done nothing yet
[5019.56s] Jeff seea I met I met Jeff in The Green
[5022.0s] Room for Charles Payne really nice guy
[5024.199s] real estate guy and or private Equity
[5027.239s] Real Estate or something along those
[5028.88s] lines anyway uh I thought this headline
[5031.12s] was great he said Trump should declare
[5033.199s] California an opportunity Zone give tax
[5035.88s] incentives to rebuild and rebuild
[5037.36s] quickly I like that idea I think it&#39;s
[5039.08s] brilliant the bull market is still
[5040.76s] intact this pullback is just the cost of
[5042.639s] doing business says a strategist we
[5044.639s] agree uh Trump team studies gradual
[5047.12s] tariff hikes under Emer emerging Powers
[5049.84s] boost duties 2 to 5% a month on trade
[5052.32s] Partners uh supporters include bessent
[5055.32s] Haslett and Moran this is really really
[5057.92s] important because that&#39;ll get people to
[5059.36s] the table before you get up to 20% an
[5061.8s] outof thebox idea for China and Trump
[5063.76s] this is from the F uh they usually are
[5066.4s] not full of good ideas but this week
[5068.199s] they were from Mark
[5069.84s] soel uh and what they&#39;re talking
[5073.44s] about
[5076.76s] was
[5078.4s] uh
[5081.88s] that the Chinese and the US should get
[5087.48s] together to defend and
[5092.679s] strengthen the Yuan
[5095.52s] and uh which weaken the dollar and uh
[5098.92s] and and have a win-win situation and
[5100.52s] help them come I think it&#39;s actually
[5102.159s] really clever idea the title of the
[5104.92s] article is an outof the-box idea for
[5106.76s] China and Trump China will do it on its
[5108.76s] own but I think uh um
[5114.36s] with implicit approval from the US it
[5117.0s] would go a lot better and a lot quicker
[5119.36s] which supports what we&#39;re set set up for
[5122.0s] investors pour billions into S&amp;P equal
[5124.08s] weight fund as Tech fears rise sometimes
[5126.8s] it&#39;s good to be with the crowd versus
[5128.48s] against it so they&#39;re getting on board
[5130.239s] treasury yields uh dollar fall following
[5132.84s] December inflation
[5134.8s] data accidents waiting to happen in
[5137.04s] private credit says welcome trust I
[5139.08s] agree with this you know the thing about
[5140.76s] private equity and uh private credit is
[5145.32s] these instruments were designed
[5148.32s] for
[5150.159s] uh pension Consultants to keep their
[5153.04s] jobs so
[5155.48s] the good news about private credit and
[5157.4s] private Equity is there is no Mark to
[5159.719s] Market so it&#39;s Mark to make believe it&#39;s
[5162.28s] Mark to whatever the purveyor of the
[5165.08s] funds decides that it&#39;s worth uh so
[5168.04s] effectively they mark it to full
[5171.36s] value until and unless they take an
[5174.8s] impairment and when they take an
[5176.199s] impairment it&#39;s usually not 10% it&#39;s
[5178.119s] usually 100% the beauty of public
[5180.4s] markets is you can see the mark to
[5182.159s] Market on a day day-to-day basis and you
[5184.0s] can get a warning uh uh well ahead of
[5187.92s] Advance okay to recheck your thesis in
[5190.4s] this with this you get perfect Mark to
[5192.36s] markets zero volatility you sleep like a
[5194.76s] baby and then you wake up and it&#39;s
[5196.08s] impaired down to zero and I think you&#39;re
[5197.719s] going to see a lot of that in private
[5199.52s] credit uh Reckless lending because they
[5201.96s] can just they Mark to and and the
[5204.28s] interesting thing is uh unlike what we
[5207.6s] do where we only get paid for
[5208.88s] performance we don&#39;t charge a management
[5210.28s] fee they&#39;re getting paid a management
[5213.119s] fee on what what they Market to so what
[5215.8s] do you think they&#39;re going to Market to
[5217.119s] they&#39;re going to Market to the highest
[5218.679s] value that they think that they can get
[5220.159s] away with uh until it gets marked down
[5223.239s] to zero but after it gets marked down to
[5225.36s] zero they don&#39;t pay back all the fees
[5227.36s] that they collected when it was marked
[5228.679s] to make believe and I think the chickens
[5231.44s] are going to come home to roost on this
[5233.04s] for everyone who&#39;s overweight private
[5234.52s] equity and private credit good luck
[5237.32s] China stocks rise on a report that Trump
[5239.719s] is considering a gradual approach to
[5241.6s] tariffs we covered that josi says

[5293.56s] concerned about uh and top shelf stock
[5296.88s] market and sentiment results article of
[5298.6s] the week we covered diio this week and
[5302.719s] uh each week we try to cover one or two
[5304.32s] companies we previously discussed and or
[5306.159s] own for clients including personally and
[5308.88s] what I usually start with is a long-term
[5311.159s] chart zoom out what you can see is this
[5313.679s] is a long-term compounder that goes
[5316.32s] through cyclical troughs every 10 or so
[5318.76s] years like you saw in 2000 in 2009 in
[5323.639s] during covid for a half a minute and in
[5327.719s] 2024 but throughout all of that time
[5330.8s] what you can con consistently see is
[5333.44s] sales relatively strong uh cash flow
[5337.76s] continues to stay strong earnings
[5340.52s] continue to stay strong and uh sales
[5343.88s] continue to grow and what did they do
[5346.32s] they reduce the share count uh in this
[5349.08s] case in the last 10 years by over 12%
[5352.48s] from 688 million down to 602 million
[5356.52s] which in improves the so even if they
[5359.119s] didn&#39;t grow sales or cash flow the uh
[5362.6s] value to you your piece of the pie
[5365.28s] continues to get larger and larger and
[5367.4s] larger even without putting uh excess uh
[5371.719s] New Capital into it and your total
[5375.04s] return on Capital has consistently been
[5377.48s] in the mid double digits this is a great
[5380.679s] compounding business with a moe uh and
[5383.239s] the return on Equity is in the 30s to
[5385.08s] 40s but we we care about total invested
[5387.52s] Capital looking here at free cash flow
[5390.08s] it&#39;s consistent with price movement
[5392.44s] again growing free cash flow over time
[5395.119s] with a series of cyclical dips in
[5397.04s] between with price dips along with those
[5399.4s] cyclical dips in cash flow and then
[5402.119s] recovery as you can see Dio&#39;s a story of
[5404.76s] cyclical downturns in the context of a
[5406.52s] long-term secular uptrend free cash flow
[5409.159s] dips and Rec uh dips and recovers every
[5412.199s] cycle the one thing that has been
[5413.6s] consistent through the years is a high
[5415.32s] return on invested capital and a
[5417.08s] continued shrinking of the share count
[5418.8s] through buyback so Global industry
[5421.8s] leader um here&#39;s the big thing that you
[5424.679s] need to know diio is the number one
[5427.92s] player in terms of
[5430.48s] premiumization which they think is a
[5432.6s] long-term Tailwind to revenue and
[5434.4s] margins we see long-term secular trend
[5436.239s] of consumers drinking less but better
[5440.44s] this is the key theme ladies and
[5442.159s] gentlemen drinking less but better
[5444.679s] gradually leading to pricing growing
[5447.44s] ahead of volume in certain categories
[5450.92s] so first and foremost um
[5457.44s] by 2030 expects to increase Global share
[5459.6s] of Total Beverage alcohol Market to 6%
[5461.719s] from 4% currently which implies 30
[5464.28s] billion in extra servings being sold
[5467.119s] this will require di to continue to
[5468.8s] acquire small players strong Innovation
[5470.56s] pipeline affordable luxury category diio
[5473.119s] has a strong pres in Emerging Markets
[5475.48s] where per capita consumption of
[5477.76s] alcoholic beverages is lower providing a
[5480.199s] huge Runway to growth huge emerging
[5482.639s] market so what are the two worries about
[5486.08s] diio one is China what we&#39;re going to
[5488.44s] find out is that their China business is
[5490.04s] doing just fine uh and two is glp 1&#39;s
[5494.92s] people no longer drinking people are
[5497.199s] drinking people will always drink people
[5499.08s] will always want to escape I don&#39;t think
[5501.32s] they&#39;re going to go out and drink 24
[5503.0s] cans of beer on glp 1&#39;s but I do think
[5506.0s] they are going to get a $100 bottle of
[5507.6s] tequila when their friends are over and
[5509.6s] pull it out because it&#39;s an affordable
[5511.199s] luxury it&#39;s you know
[5514.92s] the it&#39;s a diio brands are a status
[5518.52s] symbol so their Market is not
[5521.119s] billionaires buying a $200 bottle of
[5524.239s] tequila it&#39;s middle class and lower
[5527.56s] middle class people buying a 100 or $200
[5530.76s] bottle of tequila as an affordable
[5533.32s] luxury to show off with their friends
[5535.88s] and it&#39;s just like why do people go to
[5538.08s] Starbucks and pay $10 for a cup of
[5540.76s] coffee so they can walk around with the
[5542.32s] cup and say I&#39;m successful and can
[5544.32s] afford Starbucks otherwise they would
[5545.719s] just make it at home if you took the
[5548.04s] label uh that Starbucks girl off it and
[5551.32s] just served it in a coffee cup like you
[5553.119s] would get from a street vendor for 50
[5554.679s] cents on the corner of Fifth and you
[5557.199s] know 40th
[5558.76s] Street uh Starbucks sales would probably
[5561.639s] drop 80% over the next 12 months it&#39;s
[5564.36s] all about branding it&#39;s all about
[5566.159s] affordable luxury take the Lulu Lemon
[5568.719s] sticker off the leggings and their sales
[5572.239s] would drop 40% 60% overnight along with
[5576.0s] their margin diio it&#39;s a branding story
[5579.28s] and the other thing that&#39;s interesting
[5581.199s] is in most businesses when you have
[5584.0s] obsolete inventory you have to fire sale
[5587.84s] Market down to get it out it diio has
[5591.679s] this huge inventory 7 billion dollar of
[5596.48s] uh
[5598.28s] aged um aged scotch and whiskey and the
[5602.76s] older it gets the more valuable it
[5604.92s] becomes so uh you know if you look at
[5607.76s] Johnny Walker Black Label 12 years 15
[5609.719s] years 60y old malts they continue to
[5612.159s] invest in this and the older it gets the
[5614.159s] higher the margin they can charge with
[5615.76s] no additional fixed cost um which which
[5619.04s] is going to continue to grow and if if
[5621.0s] you&#39;re on gp1s which by the way the vast
[5624.56s] majority of the Emerging Markets is not
[5626.239s] going to be anytime
[5628.199s] soon which is where all their growth is
[5631.08s] which is xus which is international with
[5633.96s] fit in with all of our trades
[5639.0s] um you are going to continue to buy
[5641.76s] these high-end Brands because you&#39;re
[5643.119s] going to drink less but you&#39;re going to
[5644.44s] want more and you want going to want it
[5646.0s] to be a luxury symbol versus a 24 pack
[5649.04s] of Natty light so um okay Don Julio so
[5654.36s] you can read through these things that I
[5655.6s] highlighted the pluses the minuses key
[5658.0s] is compounded uh sales growth 5 to 6%
[5661.36s] they got smoked in stuffing the channel
[5663.719s] the last CEO was a scumbag basically uh
[5667.76s] well I&#39;ll take that back but what he did
[5671.04s] with the
[5671.96s] financials uh was scumbaggery they
[5674.239s] loaded the channels in La Latin America
[5676.119s] and got smoked and they&#39;re working
[5677.56s] through that dto cycle U moving into a
[5680.76s] restock cycle there was a lot of destock
[5682.679s] restock around the world because of
[5684.08s] covid you had a monster level of
[5686.52s] frontloading both in the wholesale
[5689.159s] channels and then people buying it up
[5691.119s] they&#39;re now drinking through their
[5692.719s] personal bars
[5694.199s] and uh starting to restock and that&#39;s
[5696.199s] going to benefit diio so um they talk
[5700.6s] about why they have aote why they buy
[5702.639s] the small and upcoming Brands why
[5704.28s] they&#39;re going to continue to grow share
[5706.56s] and uh this has been since the dawn of
[5708.679s] time people will want to escape people
[5710.96s] will drink alcohol and diio is the best
[5713.32s] positioned player I would not be a buyer
[5715.44s] of a massive beer player with the
[5717.719s] proliferation of uh glp 1s that&#39;s all
[5721.239s] carbs it&#39;s all what people aren&#39;t
[5723.96s] necessarily going to Crave assuming that
[5725.8s] gp1s become as predominant as people
[5729.159s] anticipate but even so in the markets
[5731.199s] where diio serves uh gp1s are going to
[5733.88s] be less and less of a factor and it&#39;s
[5735.6s] already priced for Armageddon so we like
[5737.96s] all of this we&#39;ve gone into a lot of the
[5740.52s] thing they generated 2.6 billion of free
[5742.76s] cash flow during a cyclical trough which
[5745.96s] we love because that means runway for
[5747.88s] the turnaround new CEO another key
[5750.28s] Catalyst in um uh in turnaround
[5754.48s] situations and a lot of good information
[5757.28s] here that uh we can cover you see the
[5760.36s] whiskey growth in India is off the
[5763.119s] charts um Don Julio doing well so
[5767.36s] continued opportunity continued moat
[5770.28s] continued compounder of
[5772.32s] capital Guinness is going crazy they got
[5775.0s] this new Nitro tap that they&#39;re going to
[5776.639s] roll out around the country they can&#39;t
[5778.8s] even make enough of their zero alcoholic
[5781.92s] uh z00 uh Guinness which is growing
[5785.04s] really popular for all the glp1 people
[5787.56s] and people who don&#39;t want to drink so
[5789.0s] all that&#39;s positive again here is the C
[5792.76s] uh CNN fear and greed index at
[5795.48s] 29 this is not stuff you see at tops
[5797.88s] it&#39;s stuff you see at closer to the
[5799.199s] bottoms uh and then uh as a reminder
[5801.8s] we&#39;re going to close out the q1 opening

[5842.52s] estimates revision
[5844.28s] transports top 30 weights revised down
[5846.6s] by 27 basis points retail earnings top
[5850.0s] 30 weights revised down 132 basis points
[5853.56s] last 60 days I think um we&#39;ll see some
[5857.08s] positive things out of that in the
[5858.96s] earning season and maybe adjust those
[5861.04s] pessimistic here&#39;s the inflation numbers
[5863.08s] we talked about coming in much better
[5864.599s] than expected uh earnings again just
[5867.76s] want to reemphasize which areas are
[5869.239s] going to grow earnings the most that are
[5871.52s] not yet pricing it in in
[5874.599s] 2025 uh the answer to the question is
[5878.159s] healthc care materials Industrials
[5880.92s] infotech is going to have Healthy Growth
[5883.44s] but it&#39;s decelerated massively from last
[5886.199s] year which should imply multiple
[5888.119s] contractions so with that said uh for
[5891.679s] those of you who like the ask me
[5893.04s] anything question section we&#39;re going to
[5894.679s] get started now for those of you who
[5896.84s] just tune in for the first part thank
[5898.48s] you for tuning in this week we&#39;ll be
[5900.0s] back next week same time same place and
[5902.239s] here we go with question number
[5906.599s] one
[5910.719s] uh okay uh jagar asks uh do you have a
[5915.4s] condensed version of the podcast I
[5917.159s] usually don&#39;t have two hours okay this
[5919.32s] is the same guy I&#39;m not the answer is
[5923.679s] no uh Wilhelm
[5926.599s] kerger could you please take a look at
[5928.719s] anheiser Bush in Bev similar to diio but
[5931.4s] they have contracts with Coca-Cola for
[5932.84s] production uh I just answered that
[5934.96s] question answer is no I don&#39;t want a
[5936.96s] beer company I want a premiumize branded
[5940.639s] special occasion high margin incredible
[5944.28s] business uh Aaron L giv you relatively
[5947.679s] bullish outlook for healthcare is T DOA
[5950.04s] stock uh that you&#39;d be interested in and
[5953.4s] I think we&#39;ve covered this one in recent
[5955.199s] weeks uh it&#39;s not for me I think that
[5958.36s] you might get one puff out of this
[5961.8s] because of uh
[5964.56s] um but it&#39;s just every single private
[5967.32s] healthc care business is creating their
[5969.32s] own version of this so why would they
[5971.639s] use
[5974.0s] tedoc uh cash flow leveled off
[5981.32s] revenues let&#39;s see
[5984.679s] here
[5986.719s] TD I I have no way
[5989.96s] to determine if there&#39;s a moat I think
[5994.239s] any healthcare provider could just say
[5996.0s] we&#39;ll do your consultation over the
[5997.88s] phone why do they need Ted do so let me
[6000.84s] just
[6003.32s] see it&#39;s probably cheap enough that
[6005.48s] you&#39;re going to get a bounce but let me
[6007.159s] just take a look
[6012.0s] here okay so revenue&#39;s growth is
[6014.96s] decelerating revenue is still
[6017.88s] accelerating uh they&#39;re still losing
[6019.719s] money how can you continue to lose
[6022.32s] money shares they keep growing the share
[6024.84s] count all red flags for me negative
[6028.52s] return on Capital and this is dog
[6030.76s] excuse my language but uh not for me so
[6033.84s] play it for a technical bounce if you
[6036.159s] are inclined to do that stuff but uh
[6039.599s] it&#39;s not a business that I want to be in
[6042.4s] on to the next Chris C selones we&#39;ve
[6045.639s] looked at we uh many times in the last
[6049.36s] few weeks uh we continue to it continues
[6052.719s] to be on our radar uh and I&#39;m not saying
[6055.199s] any more than that Chris
[6057.56s] Marlo
[6061.0s] uh all right big fan blah blah blah what
[6064.199s] are your chances that crown castle Cuts
[6065.76s] its dividend I think pretty low and
[6067.92s] that&#39;s not why we&#39;re in it
[6070.32s] anyway next Goron
[6074.04s] stalis um wolf semiconductor I low very
[6077.88s] low quality business not interested
[6081.119s] a okay
[6083.679s] if robot labor were to fill the
[6085.36s] demographic shortfall in China would you
[6087.239s] reconsider your idea of ditching China
[6088.96s] growth I.E Baba for Indian stocks in 5
[6091.08s] years the answer is no because robots
[6093.48s] don&#39;t buy washing machines houses make
[6095.84s] babies buy second cars when they&#39;re 35
[6098.679s] years old uh buy household wear buy beds
[6101.96s] buy buy this and that Japan has had
[6103.88s] robots for 20 years it hasn&#39;t helped
[6105.52s] them as s you got to make babies if you
[6107.48s] want to re accelerate the growth in
[6109.08s] China and uh so for that reason we&#39;re
[6111.8s] going to ride this last parabolic move
[6113.96s] and say cyanara Don L uh am I fair to
[6118.76s] say you really don&#39;t look at PE
[6121.639s] ratio uh CCI well CCI you would never
[6125.28s] look at a PE ratio because it&#39;s a re and
[6127.28s] it&#39;s fund from operations gxo looks
[6129.8s] expensive based on this metric they all
[6131.92s] all turnarounds look expensive based on
[6133.599s] that metric that&#39;s why you don&#39;t want to
[6135.199s] do it because you&#39;re buying it in the
[6136.84s] trough what you&#39;re trying to figure out
[6138.84s] is what is the normalized growth rate
[6140.96s] over time and
[6144.639s] uh when earnings recover and then the PE
[6147.92s] starts to look extremely cheap when you
[6149.76s] look two three years out if it&#39;s a
[6151.159s] durable business with a moat and not
[6153.36s] some guessing the future for a new
[6155.08s] technology which is indefensible and uh
[6158.599s] basically gambling Jay apt Keen to get
[6161.56s] your thoughts on Bull and BARC case for
[6164.36s] Dollar General uh Dollar General I think
[6166.719s] is going to be fine here this is part of
[6168.4s] the Beatdown on tariffs trade which is a
[6171.52s] lot of the stuff which when come in less
[6174.48s] bad than expected it will rebound Matt
[6177.28s] Mitchell uh blah blah blah Hershey we
[6180.32s] like it uh we&#39;re just not doing anything
[6182.52s] yet we think it&#39;s going to come down
[6183.679s] we&#39;ve covered that four or five times uh
[6186.199s] in the last month next is manique uh how
[6189.92s] much further Does Nike have to drop
[6191.88s] before it&#39;s worth a deep dive I told you
[6194.239s] a million times Nike is okay we just
[6197.119s] prefer um VF Corp and we&#39;re not going to
[6200.44s] just load it up uh to to to do it I mean
[6204.679s] what we look for is expected upside and
[6208.28s] you know Nike is not an easy triple it&#39;s
[6211.36s] not even an easy double will it recover
[6213.52s] 40 50% over the next few years yeah but
[6215.639s] that&#39;s below our expected irr uh so it
[6219.199s] doesn&#39;t meet the test but if you buy
[6221.48s] Nike at $70 or $60 or $50 are you going
[6225.199s] to do well over the next 3 to five years
[6227.159s] absolutely so uh nothing to worry about
[6229.44s] there Adrien Smith was wondering what
[6231.56s] kind of resources you&#39;d recommend for a
[6233.679s] beginner just read the um intelligent
[6237.08s] investor by Ben Graham if the light goes
[6239.159s] off continue to pursue it if it doesn&#39;t
[6241.76s] just become an entrepreneur and make
[6243.239s] your fortune that way
[6248.719s] um okay bought bought Baba before I ever
[6252.719s] heard of your podcast but listening
[6255.76s] decided to stay the course average my
[6257.719s] position down to 8173 I think 99% of the
[6261.56s] people on this podcast probably have a
