welcome to hedge fun tips with Tom Hayes I&#39;m Tom Hayes and this is your 274th videoast podcast for the week ending January 16th 2025 as always we&#39;ll do family first and then get down to business a huge amount of data to cover this week but first and foremost there&#39;s Mimi and Annabelle at the dog beach uh with luckie and pepper having a good time this week and then there&#39;s me in Los Angeles last Friday with Charles Payne was in town got to do in studio and meet all the crew at the LA Bureau of fox which was a lot of fun and then that&#39;s uh the entryway which was pretty cool another photo there so uh first thing let&#39;s get to Media want to thank Nick Palazo and Ali Thompson for having me on making money with Charles Payne Fox Business with Charles uh this was an amazing seg as a matter of fact it kind of took me by surprise cuz you know you send in some show notes and then they changed the whole thing up and he&#39;s like we&#39;re going to cover every pick you gave us last year and I was like okay here we go there there&#39;ll be a lot of good ones but there are a couple ones that haven&#39;t worked yet uh but um it was it was fair so here we go hey joining me now I want to bring in a great Capital uh chairman Tom Hayes now you guys know Tom Hayes from the show and the reason I don&#39;t have Tom on more frequently is he&#39;s the long term so he&#39;s going to tell you the same thing over and over again but here&#39;s the thing you want to listen to what Tom Hayes has to say because this guy has an amazing track record and he&#39;s with us now Tom welcome to the show man thanks for having me I just want to go so you&#39;re a long-term investor that&#39;s right so it&#39;s only fair to judge your ideas I think at least on a year-to-year basis correct so let&#39;s look at what you gave us a year ago let&#39;s do it January 2024 uh City up 33% uh Bank of America up 33% Google up 9% Amazon up 46% is that Crown cork right there uh CCI crown castle that&#39;s the only one that&#39;s down these are amazing numbers my man I mean even even with the 25% decline in there you&#39;ve got four names up 30% one up almost 50% the key here was to really I mean to know Aid to fundamentals right yeah and to have patience yeah we like to buy things when when they&#39;re out of favor uh crown castle that&#39;s gotten hit by rates it actually had a rally and it&#39;s come back in we we like crown castle here I think you know it&#39;s very interesting when we see rates I I heard your a block Jeff talking about rates I&#39;ve heard Tom Lee out there you know the 10year yield did the exact same thing in Trump 1.0 right after he got elected it blew out yields blew out the dollar rallied like crazy right after the inauguration you know what happened bonds got bid International stocks took off all the things that people thought weren&#39;t going to do well under Trump did extremely well and what what actually did poorly that first year energy did poorly that first year yeah and ironically in this last year uh solar stuff has been a disaster right under under the Solar stock of buying did great the first year of trou yeah yeah so it&#39;s amazing to when they Zig when they zag and the markets start to price this thing or they start to start to be in there so what are you saying because the average holding period like let&#39;s say 1960 people used to hold stocks six seven years y it&#39;s down to five months so is it is it tough just getting folks a hold particularly when they don&#39;t move in your direction initially well you know it&#39;s interesting this has been an aberration and we&#39;re all blinded by recency bias since 1927 value has outperformed growth by 4.4% per year so what changed since 2010 growth is absolutely smoked value uh and part of that has to but is that a paradigm shift it it could be people say uh Capital light models Etc but what actually happened was Zero interest rate policy so unless you believe that we&#39;re going back to zero interest rate policy which you know today tells you and and I think we&#39;re going to a normalized environment uh you want to start to look at some value stock you know the equity risk premium everyone&#39;s talking about that is very bearish it&#39;s the lowest it&#39;s been since 2000 which was a generational buy for value for international for small caps Etc so I think we&#39;re going to have some opportunities there I got 30 seconds to go I want to know use the word normal I&#39;m hearing normal a lot normalized what does that mean normal what is a normal U Bond yeld yeah I I think I think people overestimated us taking the terminal rate down to two and a half down to inflation we&#39;re going to just simply go right back yeah I think you know if you look at late 90s 3 and 1 half 4% is a reasonable place that where you can have economic growth you can it will be non contractionary and and that&#39;s the right sweet spot when you have demand what do you like here I&#39;m rushing you because we we&#39;re running past the time but we&#39;ve got to get some jewels from you because you&#39;re rocking and now people want to know what to buy turn around Tom likes Advanced Auto Parts this is the oh no this is the worst run auto retailing business I did a special on this bad boy but they&#39;ve got Chan o Kelly he came from HD Supply he sold off the Canada business paid down debt that&#39;s the number one thing in a turnaround is that you have solvency risk off the table closing the unprofitable disparate shops on the west coast focusing on the areas where he&#39;s number one and number two targeting margins that imply $630 million operating income by 2027 last time it had 630 million operating income last four times stock traded between 180 and $240 it&#39;s a $45 stock today we like this over the next two to three years my man we we&#39;ll see before one year from now but uh we&#39;re definitely going to be watching I love it thank you so much Budd apprciate all right folks we&#39;ll be right back and we&#39;re back uh so thanks to Charles for that and then want to thank Camille Smith for having me on CBS to talk about inflation before the inflation report here we go consumer prize index report released this morning as the country remains on inflation watch economists are forecasting December&#39;s CPI to rise 0.3% today&#39;s data will figure into the fed&#39;s interest rate decision which could impact short-term loans if numbers come in lower we may see relief on the auto and mortgage front but people shouldn&#39;t be deterred from borrowing some point you have to get on with your life uh what we&#39;re seeing is we have had a 100 basis points a cut by the FED uh that&#39;s going to be more effective as it relates to Shorter term loans you&#39;re seeing it already in a lot of Auto incentive it has less importance as it relates to morgage rates because mortgage rates are longer duration loans that&#39;s usually priced off the yield of the 10year the CPI report will come out at 8:30 this morning and we&#39;re back so quotes of the week uh Peter theel the most contrarian thing of all is not to oppose the crowd but to actually think for yourself and sometimes going with the crowd is absolutely right and sometimes uh particularly at turning points you have to have some internal fortitude to uh flip the other way and the more and more biographies you read of people who have been very very successful throughout the ages um you know going into the 19th century the 20th century uh the common denominator is usually if they didn&#39;t invent something they bought assets when they were out of favor that just just is invariably the case they they didn&#39;t buy assets on breakouts they didn&#39;t buy assets when they were trading at 50 times sales uh they were sellers of assets at at those levels but but not buyers so uh Charlie Munger a lot of people with high IQs are terrible investors because they&#39;ve got terrible temperaments look we cover that a lot on this podcast and and that&#39;s why a lot very wealthy people allocate to me is because the characteristics that make someone successful as an entrepreneur make someone very successful in business um are very different than the characteristics that make someone successful in investing in that in the business World Massive Action equals massive results the more you do the more you get the more Relentless you are the more activity you have in the pipeline the more business you do the more money you make in investing it&#39;s the discipline to to do as little as possible so massive inaction equals massive results like Charlie Munger used to say sit on your hands buy a good business at a good price and sit on your hands and that takes a lot of fortitude because you&#39;re not just sitting there twiddling your thumb you&#39;re consistently researching you&#39;re consistently testing your thesis you&#39;re consistently looking at competition you&#39;re consistently reading the transcripts doing Channel checks Etc uh while you sit there and and that&#39;s where the rewards start to come you know whether it&#39;s uh com stock resources which was kind of interesting um I was thinking about you know just looking at a couple of these things that are starting to move here um you know this one is is over a double getting close to being a triple and I had someone reach out and say why don&#39;t we sell that and the answer is is because we enter a business and own a piece of a business when there is a meaningful margin of safety and we can make at least a double and in many cases a multibagger over a reasonable amount of amount of time and we know what intrinsic value is and where we&#39;re willing to get out before we even get in and we&#39;re nowhere near intrinsic value so when we added the pv10 the proved reserves that they have to report to the SEC and our analysis of the unproved reserves which is materially more uh we don&#39;t get anywhere near and then Bernstein was out thanks to my buddy Allen for sending over uh calling for a natural gas super cycle and this looks a lot like the early 2000s where you had this breakout and then um and it just got started and the thing went from you know 20 to 400 I&#39;m not saying we&#39;re going to that level at all we we&#39;d be out a lot sooner than that anyway or at least with part of the position we don&#39;t buy it all at once and we don&#39;t sell it all at once we always keep a flyer on in case it get goes as irrationally to the upside as it does to the downside because we want to participate but that&#39;s well after we&#39;ve taken all of our money off the table and a ton of profits off the table and then we just have a flyer to to catch these ridiculous uh parabolic moves at the end but um you know and then you even look at um VF Corp which you couldn&#39;t give away and you know here we are buying three pairs of Vans buying you know 30 some odd pairs of Vans for the for the clients for Christmas and everything else and uh you know here&#39;s one I remember being on the claim and countdown last year with John Nigerian talking about VF Corp when it was at 1314 and uh you know getting a look like uh like I had leprosy or something you know uh a look at disbelief but now we&#39;re at $23 so you know up some 50 plus per and the story is literally just getting started Brack and Daryl is a winner you put a million bucks with him uh at Logitech when it was down 82% in when he uh joined in 2013 and and uh stock was down from 26 down to five and uh you know this was a 26 bagger you made 26 million bucks over the next 10 years so uh that&#39;s kind of interesting these are the things that we do this is this is our calling in life and we just rinse repeat over and over and over so okay getting back to it uh the other thing I want to cover is the implied interest rate cut odds since the inflation numbers came out and these have improved pretty materially now looking at a 60 a 73 I&#39;m sorry 63% chance of the first cut coming in June with which going into the inflation report starting the year as expectations dropped okay people were basically saying no cuts and starting to talk about hikes it always swings to the extreme if you remember a year or so ago they expected six Cuts uh they always overshoot so this year they started the year expecting you know basically no Cuts if you a week ago and some people were calling for hikes so now we&#39;re back to you know 63% chance in June which implies two cuts for the year you had Waller on this morning on CNBC uh singing the same song and you had um uh ghouls be as well and this would imply one in June maybe one in one in October for two cuts for the year that takes the FED funds rate down to uh 375 and that&#39;s probably the terminal rate and that is beautiful that probably gets a five handle high five handle on the 30-year mortgage which absolutely skyrockets the Home Building business and all ancillary related businesses like Stanley Black and&amp; Decker and many others so that&#39;s that now want to go through some charts here uh talk about where we are with the General Market uh couple here that stand out I would say this NY this nysi uh oversold this is usually where you start to see some bounces uh and we saw some follow saw some uh recovery yesterday a little bit of follow through so far today minus United Healthcare um also the NASDAQ mlen oscillator less over oversold than the nysse that makes a lot of sense based on the things that we&#39;ve been saying in the last few weeks here is the S&amp;P 500 bullish percent down to 40% on a point and figure Buy Signal you don&#39;t need to know what that is all you need to know is what happens to the market when these get at or near these extreme levels and the answer is you usually get a bounce um pring Emerging Market diffusion in indicator uh not only do you get a bounce in Emerging Markets you tend to get a bounce in the S&amp;P also when this gets uh oversold and then pmo by SPX is coming off the boil got down to uh 12% on pmo crossover all that is is like a moving average convergence Divergence uh crossover which is you know it is what it is anyway it&#39;s moving in the right direction pmo by Dow Jones Industrial starting to come off the boil got down below 15 up to 30 so these are things that point to some level of recovery here in the first quarter uh after the December and early January pause uh S&amp;P mlen summation index again these are levels where you tend to get bounces in the SNP when it gets this extreme below -400 so we like that NASDAQ intermediate term momentum oscillator again oversold so you know these are just barometer they&#39;re not foolproof Dow Dow intermediate term breath momentum same thing you get below -50 these things tend to bounce uh and so on just putting things in perspective real estate looks oversold here it got to uh 30% above their 200 day exponential moving average again that tends to be bounce level pmo by all got down to 5% it&#39;s bouncing off that I don&#39;t know where that went but um so we like that then uh this you can&#39;t make this stuff up but clsa I guess that&#39;s an Asian Bank uh inhouse proprietary model projects a 40% rally in the hangsang index this year from their lips to God&#39;s ear let&#39;s look at the uh basis of this uh comprehensive analysis quote secret hissings Point towards good rises in the market through through the spring and winter a long period of summerish lassitude and small Falls throughout the year for oop files and lovers of other slithery Critters we&#39;ve pegged each month to a different species of snake and see them sloughing off their skins to reveal like Russian dolls the true inner snake of the hangang index 2025 Fang Sho index is now out the wood snakes going to be epic for Chinese markets okay so this is a real Bank putting out an analysis of the hangsang on the basis of year of the snake you can&#39;t make this up so whatever works uh the the comedic nature of uh investing in China as it has been uh probably supports that this is the Catalyst that finally makes the trade work because fundamentals uh have not mattered but uh leaving that aside uh it&#39;s it&#39;s good to uh it&#39;s good to have some fun with this stuff let&#39;s get down to business here ton of data realized and consensus EPS growth for select us indices this is the Russell 2000 and I&#39;ve been talking about 21% earnings growth for the small caps what was that based on that was based on the S&amp;P 600 index which is more profitable based on the comp composition the regular Russell 2000 has more companies that are losing money which is always the case at massive inflection points for small caps just like the early 2000s uh when you had record companies losing money before you had the biggest seven-year run in history uh and the same thing is true for this year so if you look at the Russell versus the S&amp;P 600 which I&#39;ve been using because it&#39;s more conservative and sounds more realistic the Russell uh is expected to have 44% earnings growth next year trading at 16 times versus uh the S&amp;P 500 133% earnings growth uh equal weight 133% earnings growth NASDAQ 121% earnings growth so double the earnings growth half the multiple pretty exciting stuff uh this is from the FED Whisperer Nick timos confirming what we said now looking at two rate Cuts uh this shows Rising interest rates pressuring stocks you can see all of these spikes and we believe this is a temporary third Spike um led to weakness in the stock market and then yields rolled over and the stock market recovered we expect the same thing this time uh the other reason I had this chart up is I wanted to show you the US dollar cuz we&#39;ve talked about it in Trump 1.0 it&#39;s kind of eerily similar whether you look at the early 2000s which we&#39;ve used as a point of reference for quite some time where you had this kind of rally in the dollar and then a little bit of consolidation and then a final Peak double Peak top and then a complete rollover back down to uh where it started or if you&#39;re less bearish on the dollar and you look at the Trump bump huge rally into the Trump um uh election here as we&#39;ve seen in the last two years then you get this final Peak after the election into the inauguration and then you get a rollover for the next year that&#39;s when Chinese stocks went absolutely bananas as a reminder uh well the only Chinese stock we care about in the year of the snake is is Baba and you can see what happened you had the same buildup into the election then uh in anticipation uh of the inauguration huge selloff for 3 four months uh and then straight up parabolic move from 84 to 200 and change which is why um uh we we were uh opened up to new money early and congratulations by the way uh already a handful of new people came in congratulations on that and we&#39;re going to close out on Friday well the end of this week what Friday Saturday Sunday it doesn&#39;t matter before the inauguration and uh and and get that money deployed ahead of time which is pretty exciting uh for those folks so congratulations on that and then uh so this is that that we also talk about it in the context of the dollar two things that are setting up perfectly just like last few times uh this is not combine return so basically we came into this week into the inflation print with the expectation of zero Cuts this year you had five straight weeks of losses for both the stock market and uh treasuries that is now flipping on its head and turning pretty abruptly the last two days which is exciting to see um and then here is the bond yield cycle composite okay the bond yield cycle composite in 2025 this is from lold their kind of case we covered last week was that yields rise until February and then and then roll over uh I think it&#39;s going to be sooner than that I think I think a better analog is probably what happened in Trump 1.0 where they started to roll over right after the inauguration maybe even a little bit before which is what we&#39;re seeing now City Group economic surprise index turning back up pretty exciting to see uh concentration of S&amp;P market cap and earnings in the 10 largest index constituents so you haven&#39;t seen this level of Divergence between percent share of the S&amp;P market cap relative to share of S&amp;P earnings so you got a spread here you got 39% of the market cap but only 28% of the earnings which is has been a multiple expansion story uh aggressive multiple expansion story and honestly the last time you saw anything like that was in 2000 when you had 27% market cap and only 20% of the earnings and you know what happened next uh in that instance Tech crashed uh for the next few years I don&#39;t think we&#39;re going to crash on Tech uh oh and by the way while Tech was crashing if you owned value small cap and international you made so much money you could smile so wide and eat four bananas sideways that&#39;s really what was happening from 2000 to 2007 so I think it&#39;ll be a more muted scenario where you get consolidation in this uh but you do get a reversion back to market cap share reverting back to earning grow so either earnings growth needs to move they need to cover uh 40% of you know 40% earnings of the S&amp;P and stay 40% of the market cap which is not happening their earnings growth is decelerating from 33% now to 18% not 21% uh the mag 7 so uh be careful if you are overweight and you may be more overweight than you think not knowing it because you own the s P 500 uh which is 40% in mag 7 so that&#39;s pretty aggressive spending growth for clothing up 5 8.5% month on month was strong in December clothing uh we also have cold weather so that should be helpful for goose I&#39;m seeing a lot of Vans around here now I I am in California now so I guess you know you&#39;re born wearing vans in California uh have to keep Channel checking every time I go back to New York work at each month uh households are very optimistic about the US economy that since the election that&#39;s very constructive uh actually before the election a little bit here so that&#39;s good uh wage growth has converged for all income cohorts growth remain solid up 3% so that&#39;s good the lower income is starting to catch up to the higher income growth consumers continue to show solid momentum with spending up 2.2% in December so that&#39;s going to bode well for earnings earnings expect ation are pretty high at 11% and change and then you&#39;ve got China record us minus China real yield spread historically this has been the times that you wanted to be an owner of China&#39;s stocks whether it&#39;s uh late 2008 early 2009 we also got close there uh in that 2016 to 20 2017 period 2010 2011 and then the early 2000s so you know just looking at all these things the weight of the evidence these these are not foolproof indicators if this then that um which is why uh in the history of mankind there&#39;s been only one person that beat the market using computers which is uh renissance technology and there was another factor it&#39;s not just machine learning and all that it&#39;s what questions do you ask and if there&#39;s not the proper Market framework and history to ask the right questions it&#39;s just like putting the right prompts into G GPT uh you don&#39;t wind up with the right outcome and um so that&#39;s that moving along USG USD investment grade Bond maturity wall uh 2025 is subdued maturities 26 picks up a little bit 27 and then it goes back down uh the biggest maturities are 2 2045 and Beyond Euro investment grade bond market maturity wall picks up next year US dollar high yield bond market big maturity wall in 2028 2029 2025 not much matures so they got it all refinanced during covid which is awesome that&#39;s very very good for the markets so I you know this is kind of the Year where it might start to get a little shaky 2027 Euro high yield bond market hits the maturity wall also in 2028 so keep an eye on that business but if you know rates go down this year a lot of them can refinance if the Market&#39;s open business bankruptcy filings per capita people have been talking about this to spike back up it hasn&#39;t even got back up to pream pandemic levels and it already looks like it&#39;s rolling over so so far so good this is a key chart that we contined to remind you to pay close attention to which is the Japanese government bond yield uh continues to climb higher which is why you&#39;ve seen such a hit to the nvidias the Palante teers the mag 7 of late this is the carry trade on wine this is all the free money that&#39;s poured into those concentrated stocks was a quote unquote risk-free return because you had no cost of capital now it&#39;s a return free risk uh it&#39;s amazing how that flips on its head this is a note from Bank of America concentration risk for stocks Denmark stock market is down 20% since September driven by Nova nordis was about 60% of the stock market do you all remember when I was on Yahoo finance when there was was the absolute Mania about the glp 1es and it was a segment called um buy goodbye or goodbye so what&#39;s a what&#39;s something to buy and what&#39;s something to say goodbye to and I talked about it was a healthc care theme I talked about buy bter uh and sell or lighten up on Eli Lily okay Eli Lily&#39;s coming a little bit um uh materially and the Baxter hasn&#39;t moved yet but Baxter is going to move because they&#39;re going to sell off they&#39;re going to get the $3 billion they&#39;re going to pay down that interest rate going to go down and you&#39;re going to get a multiple reating because they&#39;re selling off the slow growth kidney business that compressed the multiple and then the remaining business has higher growth and then you&#39;re going to get a reating back to 16 17 18 times and you get a stock that shoots from 40 to 60 pretty quick so um so what they&#39;re saying here is best reminder of oh so two points I wanted to make on that one was that if you think you know people felt that there was no competition coming from a zic and Zep bound Etc um The Lily the Lily glp ones the competition came more competition has come more competition is coming so that is the same thing you will see the exact same thing with Nvidia okay for those of you who weren&#39;t even through puberty the last major semi SE semiconductor Cycles I can assure you competition is coming for NVIDIA and the margins will contract and the spend will be reduced as we move from the large language model phase of AI to the inference phase which takes a lot less uh um horsepower than the heavy lift which is the large language model which is what we&#39;ve been going through and all you need to do is look at the capex plans for big Tech uh materially lower spend this year than last year and that will continue to go down as they continue to see that the return on invested capital is di Minimus they are making the Investments not getting the returns and that&#39;s why you&#39;re seeing uh Microsoft announced this week cutting 5% of Staff Facebook this week announced cutting 5% of staff and you&#39;re going to start to see more and more headlines because they got all this spend and they got no return from the spend so they&#39;re going to look for cheaper ways to retain share they don&#39;t want to seed potential share to their competitors but do it in a way where uh the bleeding in the short term uh is containable until the realization of what everyone&#39;s expecting which will come true it&#39;ll just happen many years uh further out than we expect just like Amazon in 2000 everything that we thought Amazon would change in the world they&#39;ve done it just you were paying for 100% of that happening in 2000 when it actually realized by 2015 so in the interim because you paid for guaranteed outcome that wouldn&#39;t come till 15 years later you had a 90% draw down in the short term even though you were right about the story price is what you pay value is what you get you paid too much for what had not yet happened so this stock had to go down 90% And then take 10 years to recover and and fulfill on the promise of what&#39;s happening and we see this every single time whether it&#39;s going to be the gp1s that are going to get uh hit with competition or Nvidia that&#39;s going to get hit with competition all the beautiful things that Ai and the gp1s are doing will probably happen uh uh it&#39;ll just in the case of the AI it will take a little longer than expected and you&#39;re already paying more than what that value is worth and in the case of gp1s it&#39;s just going to be a competition Fest rate race to the bottom uh uh but more and more people will use it which will offset some of that which is which is a good thing so uh here&#39;s what she&#39;s saying note Magnificent Seven stocks have contributed 57% uh of S&amp;P return in 2024 have a combined weight index of 34% currently up to 38% of client Equity portfolio and most investors see AI bubble as B biggest upside risk best play to hedge us concentration risk increase International stock exposure in UK EU and China which outperform the US in 2024 and long despised Euro and Chinese Yuan after the Tariff announcements this is Brilliance from Michael Hartnett who is one of the best sell-side analyst in the business um I love his contrarian writings AI bubble okay so best hedge increase International stock exposure in the UK EU and China we love that call uh and buy the Euro and the Chinese Yuan after the tar tariff announcements absolutely love it uh here&#39;s what Els he said Doge plus nominal GDP boom plus creative debt management EG Trump Taps $35 trillion in home equity vers via a new gsse to help pay off $36 trillion of US debt causes us budget deficit as a percentage of GDP to fall towards 3% us 10-year treasury Falls below 3% very risk positive best play long the 30-year treasury this guy is like uh you know singing the same song I love this thesis this this is a new mix on it but if they did something around the mortgages with all the equity and that became spending Firepower we could see nominal growth which is what I&#39;ve said the only way they&#39;re going to get debt to GDP down is run nominal growth super hot run inflation slightly above Trend uh plus 3% and uh if they do that $36 trillion in new spend into the economy from home equity uh that could be monstrous and that that wasn&#39;t um something on my bingo card but uh keeping an open mind biggest inflow to cash since April 20th of course that happened right before the reversal uh bull bear indicator at bearish levels not near top levels moving on Japanese 10year government Buy yield this is the unwind of the carry trade for those of you guys don&#39;t know what I&#39;m talking about go look at an S&amp;P chart for the first one or two weeks of August last year when the bank of Japan uh decided to hike rates and which is basically unwind the carry trade hurt people with leverage on that trade uh and then they had to walk it back after you saw what happened with the market more of that to come they have no choice inflation is ramping back up in China they&#39;re going to continue to hike uh against weak demographics and it&#39;s going to be a bad thing and then you&#39;re going to see all that hot money that was Asia focused that used Japan as a false Safe Haven during the China downturn as China turns up uh all that money is going to shoot out of there and shoot out of India like it&#39;s going out of style India&#39;s overvalued right now and um it&#39;s all going to go into China Chinese 10-year government bond yields starting to move up that&#39;s a positive sign we want to see their currency go up and the yields go up is a sign of everything else moving if you look at every cycle we&#39;ve covered that a million times pboc halts Bond buying to defend Yuan as economic Gloom worsens uh headline from Bloomberg of course with that character about it this is the US dollar Chinese Yuan what here&#39;s what&#39;s interesting ladies and gentlemen look how much the dollar has appreciated against the Chinese Yuan this is not by accident this is exactly what they did in 201627 when Trump was threatening tariffs he&#39;s like they&#39;re like oh okay you want to you want to tariff us 20% we&#39;ll just devalue our currency by 20% and call it a day um and this time is no different it&#39;s kind of comical but they go through this dance and uh it&#39;s good for political headlines and uh but it has no net effect dollar Yuan exchange rate here&#39;s the 30-year historical uh look ladies and gentlemen I just pointed it out to you here visually so you could see we&#39;ve seen this same silly movie before right up to January 23rd which was the inauguration at January 20 2017 there&#39;s the inauguration you had this weakness in the Yuan and then as soon as the inauguration Yuan rolls uh um you dollar rolls over Yuan strengthens and Chinese equities take off same exact Playbook I mean it&#39;s it&#39;s comical small is less than 4% of the US Equity Market these are extremes that you saw last in when 2000 then back in 73 remember I&#39;ve talked in the 70s all the value guys made their billions like uh cooperman gabelli Buffett Etc even though the market did nothing for 12 years these are the times where fortunes are made ladies and gentlemen Buffett got started in 50s here this was the exact same environment Ben Graham here in the 30s when when this is like this this is when we make so much money it&#39;s insane and these inflection points are where fortunes are made so just keep your eye on the prize total unrealized gain loss as a percentage of Bank Equity Capital so there&#39;s uh there&#39;s still upside down on the bonds it&#39;s something worth keeping an eye on we&#39;ve had a huge run in C first and foremost we had a huge run in the uh BAC and the city which we took off last summer it&#39;s now moved up a little bit after earnings we uh still own the um uh Regional Bank basket that we bought during the mini banking crisis with svb uh in I think it was March 2023 that&#39;s up I think about double now and we&#39;re probably going to get a little more juice out of that before we start to peel it off I think there&#39;s probably another 20% in it but um that&#39;s where it is US treasuries entering sixth year of third Great Bond bear Market in the past 24 years uh ladies and gentlemen here&#39;s the recency bias that rates are going to keep going up like they did in 1980 here&#39;s the reality since 1790 these are normal spikes before rollovers normal spikes before rollovers you had one and by the way very interesting ladies and gentlemen if you read a history book it&#39;s amazing what it can tell you potentially about the future the last Spike up we had like this that wasn&#39;t 1980 was right after what the Spanish flu right after 1918 to the early 20s you had this initial Spike up because of the supply chain disruptions and other similar characteristics to what we had here and then you had a roll over for the next uh all the way to 1948 so from you know call it 1920 18 years I&#39;m not saying that&#39;s going to repeat per se but but these abrupt spikes caused by exogenous events are more the rule than the exception you had a similar situation in 1859 uh then in 1837 and then in 1795 so that is more likely and by the way if you take out this one exception you could draw a downtrend line uh it&#39;s kind kind of interesting us 10-year Break Even rate so inflation expectations had shot up ahead of the inflation reports uh this week that&#39;s now probably rolled over just like the in uh cut expectations have rolled over China CPI year onye uh spiked up rolled back so it&#39;s still positive uh they continue to say it&#39;s deflation but you still have positive prints uh CPI year onye is also turning back up PPI turning up that&#39;s a leading indicator not a lagging indicator then you&#39;ve got China net purchases by assets this shows very interesting uh their purchases of US Government corporate Federal agency bonds corporate stocks foreign stocks foreign bonds corporate bonds and uh treasury bonds and notes and you have not seen this type of negative purchases by the Chinese of these assets since those areas preceding the last five rallies in Chinese equities uh so they kept their powder dry and probably reallocated to the Chinese Equity so last time you saw it was 2001 preceding a monster rally in Chinese Equity 2008 another monster rally 2012 same thing 2017 16 into 17 last time you saw this boom same thing in early 2020 and then boom these were all preceding major rallies in China Equity so you know India&#39;s World beating e economic growth is Moder ating I I would be not allocating any money to India right now that money is going to go into China and it&#39;s going to do it fast along with the Japanese money here&#39;s the copper to gold ratio again this is what you saw in late 2016 early 2017 which precedes what major rallies in China economy every single time this got down to this level early 2000s 2008 it it preceded a monster recovery in China economy and China stock stocks so uh market cap of the largest stock relative to the 75th percentile stock weight of the top 10 stocks in the S&amp;P 500 so I continue to just reemphasize this these are concentration risks that we haven&#39;t seen since great financial crisis do bubble nifty50 Great Depression Etc if you are in the concentrated stocks I think you are not going to be happy so um you don&#39;t have to get out of all of them I think they&#39;ll do okay I just think they&#39;re going to do a lot less well because this concentration risk is going to disperse as the rest of the market with earnings growth acceleration takes overshare from the concentrated part that has earnings growth deceleration down from 33 last year to 18 this year but the multiple has not yet rated I think that&#39;s coming ladies and gentlemen the copper gold ratio same story here relative to the 10-year treasury yield I think this meets in the middle I think the 10-year treasury yield rolls over and I think the copper gold uh accelerates just like we saw preceding those uh uh rallies in 2017 2020 uh 2012 and 2008 in China equities so just cutting at it from a million different ways all point to the same thing but nothing more important than the year of the snake and the silly calendar from clsa a record number of us companies changed their CEOs last year which gave us what opportunity Mana from heaven for turnaround Tom easy pickings to find unbelievable opportunities which is usually one of the key catalysts after we get through solvency risk after we get through uh buying it at a price that would insult the board we we look for Catalyst for Change and usually in a turnaround situation the Catalyst uh for change is going to be a new CEO whether it&#39;s Brack and Daryl at vfc um some of them are just cyclical and you have to wait out like Cooper standard uh baba got a new CEO um and on and on so um moving along 10-year government bond yield again I think this peaked out here this week same with 30 we went through this chart S&amp;P erases post elction rally this is kind of interesting what happened and if you actually did equal weight probably even more so uh that was an Abrupt pause in December which is going to refresh moving forward performance of global Renewables and ESG favorites uh absolute terrible there&#39;s probably some opportunity there actual SNP earnings growth has exceeded expectations in the last few years so we&#39;re expecting 8% earnings growth this quarter is probably going to come in 11 or 12 um and then uh this continues to ramp up 11% 11% 15% and 177% we&#39;ll see how that holds up concentration we covered that here is the fed&#39;s model valuation Edge evaporates as bond yields Spike this is critical ladies and Gentlemen people are talking about the equity risk premium being so low earnings yield minus 10year treasury yield as bearish meaning expected returns for the next 10 years you&#39;re getting all these people coming back out talking about the next loss decade as they were for the last decade what this points to this how this got so skewed is the multiples of the mag 7 which have not yet rated down consistent with their earning deceleration being derated down and that creates the opportunity of a lifetime for the 493 for emerging markets for international for small caps uh that will benefit from the reating of the concentrated which has brought the equity risk premium down so the equity risk premium is probably at the worst point that it&#39;s been in 25 years if you own those concentrated basket of stocks and it couldn&#39;t be better if you&#39;re buying in in the areas that we&#39;re buying which is why we have such a low correlation to the overall S&amp;P and that&#39;s a good thing right now what do you think the return on the S&amp;P 500 will be in 2025 uh the bulk of folks uh pointed to 5 to 10% I think that&#39;s reasonable that goes back to what Peter theal said you don&#39;t have to be a contrarian I happen to agree with consensus right now uh and then you&#39;ve got the taals around 0 to 5 and 10 to 15 and I think anywhere in that range of you know call it 8 to 12% is a reasonable expectation because I don&#39;t think that concentrated basket&#39;s going to do well and even if the rest of the basket does exceptionally well which we think it will um it won&#39;t be reflected because of the current small weights this reminds me of the period in 2020 when energy got down to like 2% of the S&amp;P weight down from8 or 9 or 10 and every week I&#39;d go on when we were buying Exxon at $33 or whatever it was um pounding the table like this is not going to continue ladies and gentlemen everything that you use has energy in it uh in addition to your car and uh and sure enough that was just a monster home run S&amp;P 500 concentration median uh PE again nothing like this going all the way back to the top and the nifty50 um us has a valuation at its 20-year Peak and this remains true even if we exclude the largest technology companies uh which is why we like the international we like the small cap we like everything setting up here whereas China is on the low end of his historic valuation you can&#39;t give away China people can&#39;t get enough what what was the note this year this this week from Goldman us exceptionalism to continue only bu US stocks well last year what they said was they were the lowest Target on the street at 5400 uh for 2024 and they were 100% wrong they&#39;re basically implying no gains in 2024 they got it wrong this year they&#39;re they&#39;re saying crowd into what&#39;s already risen and they&#39;re going to be wrong again uh S&amp;P 500 quarterly EPS forecast so you can see here 133% next year uh interest rate cutting Cycles have generally been associated with Rising Equity prices so long as a recession is avoided we believe a recession already happened in 2022 they tend to happen every 4.1 years which means we front-loaded 8.2 years of recessions into two years between 2020 and 22 which should imply we&#39;ve got another four plus years six total from the last recession to um to potentially be recession free we will keep an eye on the data but when you have GDP estimates 2.5 to3 consistently coming out and earnings growth grow in the double digits very hard to have a recession ladies and gentlemen so in that case with no recession uh we could be seeing some materially uh uh improved and positive Equity prices realized and consensus EPS growth for select we covered that City Group economic surprise index turning back up that&#39;s good uh here are the charts so as you can see oh interesting my bad ladies and gentlemen uh wall Street&#39;s 2024 year end price targets Goldman was not at 5400 Goldman was at 5100 no that was 2023 okay so they were 5400 for 2024 uh here are the growth versus value just a friendly reminder ladies and gentlemen uh when conditions were set up the way that they are now for the next six consecutive years from 2000 to 2006 value outperformed growth by 29% in 2000 14% in 2022 12% in 2023 U uh 30 basis points [Music] in the next year 10% in 202 4 1.8% in 2025 133% in 2026 and that&#39;s the norm this is the exception zero interest rate policy then going back to the 80s when Reagan was in most years value outperformed growth 81 83 84 86 88 growth relative to Value again going back to the top large caps to small caps again going back to.com so if you&#39;re not buying the right thing at these extremes then you are um what can I I the way I would put it is if you&#39;re not a student of History you will miss a lot of the generational opportunities and what a lot of smart business people do is they allocate people who do to to people who do this for a living that see these things and that have the ice in their veins to sit through you know this is not a easy period to sit through but then you don&#39;t get the benefit of this regime change if you&#39;re unable to sit through and and the way that you&#39;re able to sit through is doing your work and and having the confidence because you&#39;ve done your work and you understand what&#39;s going on and then being on low leverage so you can sit through the short-term volatility to the long-term rewards you cannot have excess outperformance over time without short-term volatility ites it&#39;s just it&#39;s just the the scales of Justice you know you you got to trade one for the other if you want excess outperformance uh in the long term you have to have short-term volatility in the short term and the way that you get through short-term volatility in the short term is number one you&#39;ve done your work so you have confidence and number two uh low to no leverage and if you have those two things in place then you get the excess over time uh which is what we try to do here which is why we have such a low correlation to P versus 99% of managers being closet indexers charging you for something that you can get for free uh by being in index funds at the exact wrong time when passive indexes indexing has hit an all-time high at the exact wrong time when concentration is at an all-time high which every time it&#39;s done that we know what happens next so um here is another chart from Charlie Bello uh not only doing the value versus growth doing S&amp;P 500 versus xus International stocks and again this Zer environment has been the exception not the rule exception not the rule so unless you believe we&#39;re going back to zero interest rate policy uh you do not want to be overweight us uh relative to International you do not want to be overweight growth relative to International now does that flip in 2025 guaranteed I think it probably does do we know if it&#39;s 2025 2026 or 2027 we don&#39;t but what we buy is has a large enough margin of safety that we&#39;re we&#39;re perfectly comfortable uh taking the asym asymmetric trade now because once it goes it doesn&#39;t go like oh you get one year and a checkback it goes for streaks 2002 International outperformed domestic 6.6% 2003 11.3% 2004 10% International better than us 2005 10 % International better than us 2006 10% International better than us 2007 International 7.4% better than us returns and then early &#39;90s same thing 80s during 70s basically the Whole Decade 71 72 73 74 while us was crashing International was doing better same with 7778 and then during Reagan 8 second term 85 86 87 88 all meaningful outperformance in &#39; 86 International outperform Med Us by 44% these are not one-offs these when this this turns it turns and it doesn&#39;t look back for many many years value versus growth and to as a friendly reminder uh um value has outperformed growth by 4.4% per year since 1927 including this zero interest rate policy aberration where it&#39;s funny I was joking with someone yesterday uh uh um they had this 10year they had this computer model that they thought they could beat the markets and uh I said well how far does it back test they&#39;re like well only 10 years I&#39;m like okay well in the in the last 10 years that you&#39;ve predicated the model upon um let me tell you what&#39;s taking place okay prior to the last 10 years if you said to me Tom here&#39;s some moneyy to manage I&#39;d like you to lose 90% of the money as fast as humanly possible I would have said to you that&#39;s so easy here&#39;s all I need to do I&#39;m going to buy a basket of 20 stocks that are all trading above 10 time sales and making no money and I guarantee you I will lose 90% of your money in three years and every other decade prior to 2010 if you had bought a basket at 10 at you know 10 20 30 stocks all trading at greater than 10 times sales all making no money you would have lost 90% of your money within a matter of a few years that that is a guaranteed way to lose money except during the one decade in history when you had zero interest rate policy for the first time that actually outperformed the S&amp;P 500 losing money trading at 10 times sales okay so 2022 when they all got roasted uh and and we were you know buying Google in the hole in in Fall of 2022 buying Amazon in the whole in Fall of 2022 and making easy doubles um those folks got roasted so that was a preview of Coming Attractions when the carry trade on wines these these folks are going to get shellacked okay so what I can tell you is beware of recency bias because you will make false assumptions deadly false assumptions on the basis of what&#39;s happened in the short term and what over over a reasonable framework when you zoom out is guaranteed to cause permanent irreversible damage um so that&#39;s that here&#39;s another thing for my folks over at uh uh in Cork&#39;s class who I know listen every week and I&#39;m going to go speak to this uh group of students in early February uh here&#39;s what you have the SNP to International stocks uh from 1970 to 2024 the us out performer performance is three standard deviations above the mean so do you want to bet on it going to four standard iations or do you want to play the reversion like in 2000 and 2001 like in 1984 under Reagan like in 76 like in 70 where if you got out of the us when you were at this extreme and started to get some International exposure you dramatically outperformed for the next not one not two not three usually five six seven consecutive years I will take that asymmetry all day long and I continue to say for those getting started and those who have been with me um what Co created is a once in a 100e opportunity uh where it just the the opportunities have created will not replicate in my lifetime in the way that they are from what we&#39;re seeing right now um and we are positioned to take advantage of them here&#39;s another way of looking Emerging Markets to s P again going back so there you go hiring blue past expectations with 256,000 jobs added into December so that was the Catalyst for people saying no Cuts or hikes are coming in 2020 uh five which will prove to be incorrect non-farm payrolls the growth was in healthc care and social assistance the contraction was in manufacturing that is going to change under Trump that also has something to do with Automation and Robotics but um we&#39;ll see how that plays out uh consumer sentiment index Rose economic conditions Rose we got a lot of data this week inflation expectations Rose after the jobs report that&#39;s what hurt yields that&#39;s changed after the PPI and CPI ppi is a leading indicator here was the implied probability of a raid hike you saw it Spike up after uh December and January that&#39;s now probably rolling over Chinese Trade Surplus is at a trillion dollars that&#39;ll normalize as the Yuan strengthens number of stocks and uptrends continues to dwindle they say that like it&#39;s a bearish thing that&#39;s usually a bullish thing what you see closer to Bottoms than tops uh S&amp;P 500 members greater than the 50-day moving average again it&#39;s like a bearish thing it&#39;s not a bearish thing this is what you see at bottoms like in the fall of 2023 turning the with the cyclical rebound this is from Bank of America December likely marked the beginning of a cyclical Rebound in manufacturing which has been in a downturn for over 2 years longest in history with half of the S&amp;P uh earnings tied to manufacturing the cyclical rebound should lead to volume growth driving better operational leverage and margins 67% of companies are expected to post positive EPS growth similar to last quarter but that is expected to improve uh to 95% by Q4 of 2025 moreover a record which is a record high uh moreover albeit still slow over 25% of companies are expected to outpace the mag 7&#39;s earnings growth by Q3 2025 versus the low of 8% that is huge ladies and gentlemen let me repeat that over 25% of companies are expected to outpace the mag 7 zps growth by 3Q 2025 versus the low of 8% so three times as many companies are going to outpace uh the S&amp;P mag the mag 7even earnings then did at the low uh just a short time ago consensus expects 9% earnings growth in the fourth quarter we&#39;ll probably get 11% you can see here [Music] where that is lightweight vehicle SAR versus Domestic Auto inventory you can see here the inventories are still low this looks very much like um both the 2000 when Charlie made his fortune on Teno which was the inspiration for our Cooper standard trade you get these collapses off of high levels and then these recoveries and then 2009 is a closer example where you got this kind of double you know absolute catastrophic collapse like we we had during covid and then you start to take off a little check back before the absolute parabolic move uh up as inventories catch up to SAR and that&#39;s where we are there durable goods orders minus Motor Vehicles versus inventory same type of thing you saw in 08 and 09 before a huge run in Auto Part suppliers consensus expects 67% of companies to grow EPS year on-ear in Q4 same as Q3 but 95% by Q Q4 2025 95% earnings of components growing earnings by Q4 of this year which speaks to the broadening over a quarter of stocks are expected to outgrow EPS versus the mag 7 Up from 8% off the lows so you can see these type of Cycles last time you had it was uh the end of covid and then prior to that 2017 and sure enough you get the broadening coming back in a material way here&#39;s another way to look at it in terms of earnings and here&#39;s another sector by sector you can see here where the earnings growth is going to start to kick in materially is Health Care uh uh materials is going to be huge in the back half of next year Industrials huge back half of next year energy all the things that you can&#39;t give away right now so that&#39;s exciting here&#39;s the dstock cycle to the restock cycle just like in the early 2000s huge move up off the lows then a check back and then a final move same thing here semis and a saw the biggest destocking year over-year so now we&#39;re into the restock cycle build those inventories back up get the incentives going Off to the Races Capa growth just accelerated for non mag 7 PL for the first time since 3Q 2022 uh so that&#39;s a positive sign and we were talking about that earlier CEOs expecting higher capex over the next six months so CEO confidence is coming back rail Freight carloads still okay Korean experts exports still okay those are leading indicators uh this has been the most rate sensitive manufacturing cycle in history so you see it going all the way back to when to 2001 uh and then straight up after that and I think we&#39;re going to see a similar thing which will be good for what for value versus growth January to February has seasonally been the weakest guidance period um so we&#39;ll we&#39;ll see how that guidance plays out in coming weeks corporate sentiment remains strong uh corporate sentiment has historically LED quarterly EPS growth by a quarter so that&#39;s a good thing to see reporting by week the biggest week is going to be the January 27th to the 31st and then the first week of February we&#39;re just ramping up moving into next week will be kind of like this week but the big week is the week after that here is an update from Baxter they spoke at the JP Morgan healthc care conference preliminary guidance anticipate sales growth of 4 to 5% adjusted operating margin of 16.5 restarting the North Cove facility which was hit by the hurricane [Music] um and obviously uh sale of the kidney business to carile ear 2025 q1 2025 proceeds of about 3.2 billion to be used exclusively for debt reduction reinvestment and potential share BuyBacks uh so that&#39;s going to be a catalyst for reating because the kidney business was the slowest grower and as they get earnings growth back uh and uh debt deleveraging and interest expense down uh we&#39;ll see a multiple expansion and get that stock Off to the Races which is exciting moving along small business optimism turning up producer prices cooling all things we want to see that&#39;s a leading indicator uh BuyBacks announce BuyBacks what&#39;s the biggest sector is healthc care energy financials and Staples are having the biggest BuyBacks whereas in backward looking it had been Tech here&#39;s from Seth golden one thing we should anticipated in investors Traders from the high valuations is bigger pullbacks when valuations in the 9 to 10% desile top desiles correction probabilities increase sharply 80% probability of 10% correction 98% of a 5% pullback so yeah and and they&#39;re going to be concentrated in where those areas that you have concentration here&#39;s 52 we lows this people look at as bearish it&#39;s it&#39;s usually what you see near short-term bottoms uh General road map for 2025 this is from Larry Williams who&#39;s been pretty hot the last couple of years uh up and down over the last 40 but he&#39;s been doing it for a while this is his cycle analysis which points to uh little bit of weakness going into early February and then straight up through the rest of the year we&#39;ll see if that proves to be the correct uh here we go on the slomer slides we got two sler from RBC thanks to my buddy over there so it&#39;s showing momentum turning back up on the S&amp;P bond yields topping out getting overbought dollar topping out losing momentum all the things that we&#39;re talking about again just a different way to look at it these are the things you check yourself before you wreck yourself you know I mean you you look at every possible way to analyze and stress test your framework uh and the more ways you can stress test it the higher confidence level you can do and then you always manage risk uh for something that you don&#39;t know that you don&#39;t know or a Black Swan so no matter what happens uh you live another day for the recovery and then the follow through and then the outsize returns over time uh and that&#39;s that&#39;s the name of the game here is the S&amp;P 500 bouncing after that uh uh inflation report and then momentum turning up same thing with yields rolling over dollar small caps and midcaps up against this trend line uh small caps breaking out is going to be the big story of 2025 in the US that is international outperforming is going to be the other big story that no one&#39;s prepared for no one&#39;s even talking about preparing for they&#39;ve just forgotten all about International which is the perfect time to be getting involved industrial is bouncing up and then what do we have here smart money buying and selling activities this is the what you see at lows on the indices they&#39;ve been selling in the hole which is what they do every single time hedge fund hedge funds are the most bullish on the dollar since 2019 we know what happens after they get overweight uh you tend to get a reversal everyone&#39;s crowded into one side of the boat uh after the 1973 nifty50 draw down the average stock recovered in half of the time the ones that got smoked that didn&#39;t recover for a long time were uh the concentrated um nifty50 the top handful of Weights in that index took many years to recover whereas the rest of the market recovered very very quickly dollar sentiment index is at a high at the same high that you see at all the previous p uh gold after US dollar rally sentiment exceeds this is gold sentiment so good luck with that uh instances where Vic&#39;s one-day percentage change is greater than 60% and S&amp;P for and S&amp;P 500 performance so this is from fun Strat he&#39;s implying that the S&amp;P could recover to 6500 by mid-February based on this I think this is um tenuous possible but tenuous not enough of a data sample to draw strong confidence uh conclusions but I think the the direction is correct uh and I think a lot of people were not position to that going for that going into the inflation prints that started things moving in the right direction and speaking of which yeah and today as well that&#39;s exciting all right spreads as a percentage of yield our near record lows these levels have not been seen since before the financial crisis look this is what you see for many many years these are a trend uh you can have hiccups like we saw in 2023 but this can last for many many years uh spreads contract after having a heart attack like we saw in covid 2020 I had a friend who was so bearish in 20 in the hole in 2022 and he basically sold everything in the hole he didn&#39;t admit it but that&#39;s what he did because he said that this was going to spike right back up and he showed me all these examples where it spiked right back up and I said that I&#39;m telling you this is the time to be buying not selling you know Market&#39;s already down 25% buy everything and uh um he took the other side trade so anyway you just have to be burdened by history none of these things are guaranteed he could have been right but the underlying fundamentals didn&#39;t support that view and that&#39;s why we were buyers versus sellers in the whole United States producers uh prices final demand Less Foods and energy this is a collapse I mean this is good this is a leading indicator as well hyperscaler capex growth this is what I was talking about ladies and gentlemen uh the annual capex growth is declining from 50% growth last year to 21% growth this year which is coincident with the earnings growth deceleration next 12 month PE okay you can see mid caps versus 493 versus S&amp;P versus small caps we&#39;ve covered annual earnings growth you could see here the Magnificent 7 in Blue uh next is dropping from 3 33% down to 18% S&amp;P 493 is going from 3% last year to 11% next year this year to 133% next year whereas mag 7 is 33 last year 18 this year 16 next year one&#39;s going up one&#39;s going down where do you want to be where do you think you&#39;re going to see multiple contraction where do you think you&#39;re going to see multiple expansion can&#39;t reemphasize this enough and and I haven&#39;t reemphasized this enough um only 50 times every week for the last few weeks uh let&#39;s see here revenues foreign revenues exposure by sector this is pretty interesting the S&amp;P 500 has 28% exposure so you may see some short-term headwinds from the dollar being strong in Q4 that&#39;s something to keep in mind that&#39;ll probably impact guidance as well which is interesting because guidance is weakest in Janu January and February uh we covered this Sensi of sales growth to changes in US dollar B sector number of months with consecutive payroll gains since 1939 with a positive December 20 this cycle will move into the second longest period of consecutive job gains not stuff you generally see during a recession uh we covered the household and service you can see the Japanese topics uh breaking this whatever they call this a bare flag uh for all the technicians out there this is key Trump team studies gradual tariff hikes under emergency Powers this is a big deal uh and the market liked this when this headline came out gradual versus all at once that gives them average power you know if they go up 2% every month for 10 months every month they ratchet up the heat bring them to the table so maybe they don&#39;t have to go to the full 20% and uh the second thing that they talked about was targeting certain industries versus blanket which is also a positive thing you can tell bessent is hard at work uh providing a level of rationality Rock Bottom valuations imply plenty of upside when sentiment improves this is emerging markets in Brazil uh this one&#39;s particularly to talk targeted at emerging markets in Brazil again one more data point confirming what we&#39;ve been talking about uh the level of oversold be which preceded every single previous massive rally in emerging markets and Brazil equal weight versus S&amp;P 500 bottoming and turning up this is a positive thing just like we saw in the summer that happened that continued all the way till December then we took a break now we&#39;re recovering Traders brace for biggest S&amp;P earnings day reactions ever uh S&amp;P 600 around election days so this has been weaker than normal I think we&#39;ll get a catch up on the S&amp;P 600 here&#39;s the Russell 2000 down to its 50-day moving average ready to bounce off we think that&#39;s imminent stocks have been riding a wave of liquidity you can see how that targets there I think that liquidity is going to be a function of the Japanese carry trade which when that starts to the air starts to come out the air is going to come out of the concentrated stocks we&#39;ve talked about stocks have historically done better under reelected presidents early in their second terms so average return is 99.6% uh which I think is right in The Sweet Spot of what we&#39;re looking for for the indices this year I think we&#39;re going to see Fortunes in the non- indices this year and I think we&#39;re set up extremely well for that PPI truckload Bank of America truckload demand indicator versus ISM truckloads turning up predictive of ISM Manufacturing turning up predictive of everything else that we&#39;ve been talking about consensus on the bonds is too bearish contrarily not supported of further rise in bond yields small retailer sentiment on Treasury bonds selling in the whole just like they do on every single turn turn turning point once you got the retail sentiment super bearish bonds that&#39;s when you get the recovery and you can see it looking back to 2015 uh same thing with the dollar consensus dollar is too bullish contrarily not supportive of a further rise in the dollar whose hand over fist bullish hedge funds and small retailer Traders are more bullish on the dollar than they&#39;ve ever been which points to a roll over small business optimism index taking off uh you can see the uh stocks losing momentum due to Dollar strength while dollar is now going to weaken which is going to be good for equities and then uh Tech position is vulnerable as it again significantly above levels implied by earnings growth with gap similar to that scene in early July ahead of the two Q2 earnings season right before we had the rotation so again another way to look at the same thing that we&#39;re looking at check yourself before you wreck yourself cross check everything here&#39;s TLT and what you see is bond market shorts are about to get squeezed a rally in bonds is bullish for stocks so you can see here this level of extreme not seen for many years and which preceded rallies or at least short-term B bounce backs but definitely rallies in bonds and TLT short interest is at all-time highs and these folks are going to get their tases squeeze City Goldman Sachs Chief Economist expects Trump to slap 20% extra tariffs on most Chinese Goods on average only uh not the 60% as advertised Intel stock has been beaten down how a new CEO could shake things up they also um are separating their Venture Capital arm that&#39;s been a division since 1991 can Doge really Slash 2 trillion musk is now talking about 1 trillion which is good from uh both an inflation and a deflation standpoint 2 trillion might have been deflationary 1 trillion is the right number um uh China&#39;s Central Bank beefs up support of the Yuan near 16-month low same thing at 2017 which we covered Hershey seeks new CEO with Michelle Buck departing next year that is a positive Catalyst we have our eye on that stock we&#39;ve done nothing yet Jeff seea I met I met Jeff in The Green Room for Charles Payne really nice guy real estate guy and or private Equity Real Estate or something along those lines anyway uh I thought this headline was great he said Trump should declare California an opportunity Zone give tax incentives to rebuild and rebuild quickly I like that idea I think it&#39;s brilliant the bull market is still intact this pullback is just the cost of doing business says a strategist we agree uh Trump team studies gradual tariff hikes under Emer emerging Powers boost duties 2 to 5% a month on trade Partners uh supporters include bessent Haslett and Moran this is really really important because that&#39;ll get people to the table before you get up to 20% an outof thebox idea for China and Trump this is from the F uh they usually are not full of good ideas but this week they were from Mark soel uh and what they&#39;re talking about was uh that the Chinese and the US should get together to defend and strengthen the Yuan and uh which weaken the dollar and uh and and have a win-win situation and help them come I think it&#39;s actually really clever idea the title of the article is an outof the-box idea for China and Trump China will do it on its own but I think uh um with implicit approval from the US it would go a lot better and a lot quicker which supports what we&#39;re set set up for investors pour billions into S&amp;P equal weight fund as Tech fears rise sometimes it&#39;s good to be with the crowd versus against it so they&#39;re getting on board treasury yields uh dollar fall following December inflation data accidents waiting to happen in private credit says welcome trust I agree with this you know the thing about private equity and uh private credit is these instruments were designed for uh pension Consultants to keep their jobs so the good news about private credit and private Equity is there is no Mark to Market so it&#39;s Mark to make believe it&#39;s Mark to whatever the purveyor of the funds decides that it&#39;s worth uh so effectively they mark it to full value until and unless they take an impairment and when they take an impairment it&#39;s usually not 10% it&#39;s usually 100% the beauty of public markets is you can see the mark to Market on a day day-to-day basis and you can get a warning uh uh well ahead of Advance okay to recheck your thesis in this with this you get perfect Mark to markets zero volatility you sleep like a baby and then you wake up and it&#39;s impaired down to zero and I think you&#39;re going to see a lot of that in private credit uh Reckless lending because they can just they Mark to and and the interesting thing is uh unlike what we do where we only get paid for performance we don&#39;t charge a management fee they&#39;re getting paid a management fee on what what they Market to so what do you think they&#39;re going to Market to they&#39;re going to Market to the highest value that they think that they can get away with uh until it gets marked down to zero but after it gets marked down to zero they don&#39;t pay back all the fees that they collected when it was marked to make believe and I think the chickens are going to come home to roost on this for everyone who&#39;s overweight private equity and private credit good luck China stocks rise on a report that Trump is considering a gradual approach to tariffs we covered that josi says Alibaba Imports $50 billion worth of us Goods annually to help cushion the trade deficit so uh well said Alibaba is pro Trump Microsoft pauses hiring in the US Consulting unit as part of a cost

rising ing 10-year treasury pulls back aggressively after core inflation is light in December Disney wins the 2024 box office as yearend receipts offer a welcome boost bonds have Banner day as inflation report revives fed cut bets Chicago fed presiden sees promising progress on inflation here&#39;s what he&#39;s concerned about uh and top shelf stock market and sentiment results article of the week we covered diio this week and uh each week we try to cover one or two companies we previously discussed and or own for clients including personally and what I usually start with is a long-term chart zoom out what you can see is this is a long-term compounder that goes through cyclical troughs every 10 or so years like you saw in 2000 in 2009 in during covid for a half a minute and in 2024 but throughout all of that time what you can con consistently see is sales relatively strong uh cash flow continues to stay strong earnings continue to stay strong and uh sales continue to grow and what did they do they reduce the share count uh in this case in the last 10 years by over 12% from 688 million down to 602 million which in improves the so even if they didn&#39;t grow sales or cash flow the uh value to you your piece of the pie continues to get larger and larger and larger even without putting uh excess uh New Capital into it and your total return on Capital has consistently been in the mid double digits this is a great compounding business with a moe uh and the return on Equity is in the 30s to 40s but we we care about total invested Capital looking here at free cash flow it&#39;s consistent with price movement again growing free cash flow over time with a series of cyclical dips in between with price dips along with those cyclical dips in cash flow and then recovery as you can see Dio&#39;s a story of cyclical downturns in the context of a long-term secular uptrend free cash flow dips and Rec uh dips and recovers every cycle the one thing that has been consistent through the years is a high return on invested capital and a continued shrinking of the share count through buyback so Global industry leader um here&#39;s the big thing that you need to know diio is the number one player in terms of premiumization which they think is a long-term Tailwind to revenue and margins we see long-term secular trend of consumers drinking less but better this is the key theme ladies and gentlemen drinking less but better gradually leading to pricing growing ahead of volume in certain categories so first and foremost um by 2030 expects to increase Global share of Total Beverage alcohol Market to 6% from 4% currently which implies 30 billion in extra servings being sold this will require di to continue to acquire small players strong Innovation pipeline affordable luxury category diio has a strong pres in Emerging Markets where per capita consumption of alcoholic beverages is lower providing a huge Runway to growth huge emerging market so what are the two worries about diio one is China what we&#39;re going to find out is that their China business is doing just fine uh and two is glp 1&#39;s people no longer drinking people are drinking people will always drink people will always want to escape I don&#39;t think they&#39;re going to go out and drink 24 cans of beer on glp 1&#39;s but I do think they are going to get a $100 bottle of tequila when their friends are over and pull it out because it&#39;s an affordable luxury it&#39;s you know the it&#39;s a diio brands are a status symbol so their Market is not billionaires buying a $200 bottle of tequila it&#39;s middle class and lower middle class people buying a 100 or $200 bottle of tequila as an affordable luxury to show off with their friends and it&#39;s just like why do people go to Starbucks and pay $10 for a cup of coffee so they can walk around with the cup and say I&#39;m successful and can afford Starbucks otherwise they would just make it at home if you took the label uh that Starbucks girl off it and just served it in a coffee cup like you would get from a street vendor for 50 cents on the corner of Fifth and you know 40th Street uh Starbucks sales would probably drop 80% over the next 12 months it&#39;s all about branding it&#39;s all about affordable luxury take the Lulu Lemon sticker off the leggings and their sales would drop 40% 60% overnight along with their margin diio it&#39;s a branding story and the other thing that&#39;s interesting is in most businesses when you have obsolete inventory you have to fire sale Market down to get it out it diio has this huge inventory 7 billion dollar of uh aged um aged scotch and whiskey and the older it gets the more valuable it becomes so uh you know if you look at Johnny Walker Black Label 12 years 15 years 60y old malts they continue to invest in this and the older it gets the higher the margin they can charge with no additional fixed cost um which which is going to continue to grow and if if you&#39;re on gp1s which by the way the vast majority of the Emerging Markets is not going to be anytime soon which is where all their growth is which is xus which is international with fit in with all of our trades um you are going to continue to buy these high-end Brands because you&#39;re going to drink less but you&#39;re going to want more and you want going to want it to be a luxury symbol versus a 24 pack of Natty light so um okay Don Julio so you can read through these things that I highlighted the pluses the minuses key is compounded uh sales growth 5 to 6% they got smoked in stuffing the channel the last CEO was a scumbag basically uh well I&#39;ll take that back but what he did with the financials uh was scumbaggery they loaded the channels in La Latin America and got smoked and they&#39;re working through that dto cycle U moving into a restock cycle there was a lot of destock restock around the world because of covid you had a monster level of frontloading both in the wholesale channels and then people buying it up they&#39;re now drinking through their personal bars and uh starting to restock and that&#39;s going to benefit diio so um they talk about why they have aote why they buy the small and upcoming Brands why they&#39;re going to continue to grow share and uh this has been since the dawn of time people will want to escape people will drink alcohol and diio is the best positioned player I would not be a buyer of a massive beer player with the proliferation of uh glp 1s that&#39;s all carbs it&#39;s all what people aren&#39;t necessarily going to Crave assuming that gp1s become as predominant as people anticipate but even so in the markets where diio serves uh gp1s are going to be less and less of a factor and it&#39;s already priced for Armageddon so we like all of this we&#39;ve gone into a lot of the thing they generated 2.6 billion of free cash flow during a cyclical trough which we love because that means runway for the turnaround new CEO another key Catalyst in um uh in turnaround situations and a lot of good information here that uh we can cover you see the whiskey growth in India is off the charts um Don Julio doing well so continued opportunity continued moat continued compounder of capital Guinness is going crazy they got this new Nitro tap that they&#39;re going to roll out around the country they can&#39;t even make enough of their zero alcoholic uh z00 uh Guinness which is growing really popular for all the glp1 people and people who don&#39;t want to drink so all that&#39;s positive again here is the C uh CNN fear and greed index at 29 this is not stuff you see at tops it&#39;s stuff you see at closer to the bottoms uh and then uh as a reminder we&#39;re going to close out the q1 opening at the end of this week so if you&#39;re interested uh go to hedge fund tips.com and click on money management see if you qualify as long as you get your in before Friday uh you will be able

revision transports top 30 weights revised down by 27 basis points retail earnings top 30 weights revised down 132 basis points last 60 days I think um we&#39;ll see some positive things out of that in the earning season and maybe adjust those pessimistic here&#39;s the inflation numbers we talked about coming in much better than expected uh earnings again just want to reemphasize which areas are going to grow earnings the most that are not yet pricing it in in 2025 uh the answer to the question is healthc care materials Industrials infotech is going to have Healthy Growth but it&#39;s decelerated massively from last year which should imply multiple contractions so with that said uh for those of you who like the ask me anything question section we&#39;re going to get started now for those of you who just tune in for the first part thank you for tuning in this week we&#39;ll be back next week same time same place and here we go with question number one uh okay uh jagar asks uh do you have a condensed version of the podcast I usually don&#39;t have two hours okay this is the same guy I&#39;m not the answer is no uh Wilhelm kerger could you please take a look at anheiser Bush in Bev similar to diio but they have contracts with Coca-Cola for production uh I just answered that question answer is no I don&#39;t want a beer company I want a premiumize branded special occasion high margin incredible business uh Aaron L giv you relatively bullish outlook for healthcare is T DOA stock uh that you&#39;d be interested in and I think we&#39;ve covered this one in recent weeks uh it&#39;s not for me I think that you might get one puff out of this because of uh um but it&#39;s just every single private healthc care business is creating their own version of this so why would they use tedoc uh cash flow leveled off revenues let&#39;s see here TD I I have no way to determine if there&#39;s a moat I think any healthcare provider could just say we&#39;ll do your consultation over the phone why do they need Ted do so let me just see it&#39;s probably cheap enough that you&#39;re going to get a bounce but let me just take a look here okay so revenue&#39;s growth is decelerating revenue is still accelerating uh they&#39;re still losing money how can you continue to lose money shares they keep growing the share count all red flags for me negative return on Capital and this is dog excuse my language but uh not for me so play it for a technical bounce if you are inclined to do that stuff but uh it&#39;s not a business that I want to be in on to the next Chris C selones we&#39;ve looked at we uh many times in the last few weeks uh we continue to it continues to be on our radar uh and I&#39;m not saying any more than that Chris Marlo uh all right big fan blah blah blah what are your chances that crown castle Cuts its dividend I think pretty low and that&#39;s not why we&#39;re in it anyway next Goron stalis um wolf semiconductor I low very low quality business not interested a okay if robot labor were to fill the demographic shortfall in China would you reconsider your idea of ditching China growth I.E Baba for Indian stocks in 5 years the answer is no because robots don&#39;t buy washing machines houses make babies buy second cars when they&#39;re 35 years old uh buy household wear buy beds buy buy this and that Japan has had robots for 20 years it hasn&#39;t helped them as s you got to make babies if you want to re accelerate the growth in China and uh so for that reason we&#39;re going to ride this last parabolic move and say cyanara Don L uh am I fair to say you really don&#39;t look at PE ratio uh CCI well CCI you would never look at a PE ratio because it&#39;s a re and it&#39;s fund from operations gxo looks expensive based on this metric they all all turnarounds look expensive based on that metric that&#39;s why you don&#39;t want to do it because you&#39;re buying it in the trough what you&#39;re trying to figure out is what is the normalized growth rate over time and uh when earnings recover and then the PE starts to look extremely cheap when you look two three years out if it&#39;s a durable business with a moat and not some guessing the future for a new technology which is indefensible and uh basically gambling Jay apt Keen to get your thoughts on Bull and BARC case for Dollar General uh Dollar General I think is going to be fine here this is part of the Beatdown on tariffs trade which is a lot of the stuff which when come in less bad than expected it will rebound Matt Mitchell uh blah blah blah Hershey we like it uh we&#39;re just not doing anything yet we think it&#39;s going to come down we&#39;ve covered that four or five times uh in the last month next is manique uh how much further Does Nike have to drop before it&#39;s worth a deep dive I told you a million times Nike is okay we just prefer um VF Corp and we&#39;re not going to just load it up uh to to to do it I mean what we look for is expected upside and you know Nike is not an easy triple it&#39;s not even an easy double will it recover 40 50% over the next few years yeah but that&#39;s below our expected irr uh so it doesn&#39;t meet the test but if you buy Nike at $70 or $60 or $50 are you going to do well over the next 3 to five years absolutely so uh nothing to worry about there Adrien Smith was wondering what kind of resources you&#39;d recommend for a beginner just read the um intelligent investor by Ben Graham if the light goes off continue to pursue it if it doesn&#39;t just become an entrepreneur and make your fortune that way um okay bought bought Baba before I ever heard of your podcast but listening decided to stay the course average my position down to 8173 I think 99% of the people on this podcast probably have a basis in the low 80s in Baba uh and with some of your other picks I&#39;ve gotten my account up to 400,000 from 200,000 in a little less than two years so thank you for everything you do you&#39;re welcome where&#39;s my Christmas card all right well thank you for the kind words I&#39;m I&#39;m super happy I hear a lot of those stories and most of the stories are people who call me to become clients that have uh listened to the ideas made money with them and then they&#39;re like what am I doing I&#39;m running another business here I don&#39;t want to watch the markets and then they just call me and they say I&#39;m putting one I&#39;m putting five I&#39;m putting 10 whatever it happens to be and uh we&#39;re grateful for that hey Tom what do you think of VMO and [Music] fvrr um it&#39;s from Lucas fvrr I just ah I don&#39;t know there there&#39;s just a lot of ways like I&#39;ve used Fiverr for different things there&#39;s just ways to circumvent it so I don&#39;t really love it revenues are rolling over a little bit it&#39;s probably okay for a trade I I don&#39;t think it&#39;s a good enough business um VMO take a look at that and we&#39;ve looked at Fiverr before and said no so I&#39;m not going to do it again uh Vimeo is the video business wow it&#39;s a tiny business I don&#39;t understand this business well enough it might be worth some study but uh for me it doesn&#39;t look like a good enough business to spend the time so I&#39;m not going to do it uh that&#39;s a new client Michael got that Ryan thoughts on bear we&#39;ve covered it a million times I&#39;mma pass on that one Griffin Brown thoughts on IND overvalued not interested Drew robinsson EOS if this is the company I think it is it&#39;s a hard pass yeah I know

don&#39;t know but we have exposure to this theme uh with uh Advanced Auto Parts so we&#39;re not going to double down on the same theme and we like the uh asymmetry of uh Advanced Auto Parts and the leadership better uh this is someone asking me to run ads which we don&#39;t do and with that said we are done for this week we&#39;ll be back next week same time same place in the meantime make it a
