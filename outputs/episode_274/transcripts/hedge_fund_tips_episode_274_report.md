**Tom's Current Market Conviction: Bullish, especially on value, small caps, and international equities. → 9/10** 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥☆

- Normalization of interest rates favoring value over growth.
- Extreme concentration in the Magnificent Seven creating a reversion opportunity.
- Oversold conditions in emerging markets and international equities.
- Potential for a weaker dollar benefiting international investments.
- Turnaround opportunities driven by new CEOs and cyclical recoveries.

## Macro Thesis & Key Data Points
The macro environment is shifting from a zero-interest rate policy-driven growth market to a more normalized environment favoring value. The equity risk premium is very bearish for concentrated growth stocks but creates a generational buying opportunity for value, international, and small caps. The dollar is likely to weaken, benefiting international equities. A cyclical rebound in manufacturing is expected. Rate cuts are coming.

| Indicator | Value | Tom's Interpretation |
|-----------|-------|----------------------|
| Equity Risk Premium | Lowest since 2000 | Very bearish for concentrated growth stocks, generational buy for value, international, and small caps. |
| Implied Interest Rate Cut Odds | 63% chance of a cut in June | Implying two cuts for the year, taking the Fed funds rate down to 3.75%, which is beautiful and will help the homebuilding business. |
| US minus China Real Yield Spread | Record | Historically, this has been the time to be an owner of China's stocks. |
| Hyperscaler Capex Growth | Declining from 50% to 21% | Coincident with earnings growth deceleration, impacting concentrated tech stocks. |
