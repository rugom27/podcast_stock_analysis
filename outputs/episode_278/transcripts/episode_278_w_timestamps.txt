[73.08s] Varan company want to thank Preston
[75.72s] myelle Christian dagger and Co and
[78.799s] obviously uh Stu Varney for having me on
[81.56s] for that segment we&#39;re going to listen
[82.88s] in here group led by Elon Musk has made
[85.6s] a bid to his former partner for a
[87.52s] takeover of open AI love this story how
[91.56s] much is he I couldn&#39;t believe it when I
[93.0s] heard it last night so the Wall Street
[94.6s] Journal says it&#39;s a 97.4 billion bid
[98.56s] it&#39;s for the nonprofit that controls
[101.36s] open AI the maker of chat GPT and the
[104.32s] timing this is coming right when open AI
[107.24s] is transitioning to a for-profit company
[110.6s] and Elon Musk is trying to stop all of
[112.56s] that so the openi CEO is Elon musk&#39;s
[116.28s] arch rival who his former partner by the
[118.6s] former they founded this company
[120.039s] together about a decade ago so Sam Alman
[122.92s] responded to this unsolicited bid by
[125.2s] Elon Musk on X saying No thank you but
[127.799s] we will buy Twitter which is now called
[129.92s] X for 9.74 billion if you want he just
[133.2s] moved the decimal point over one right
[135.48s] and he&#39;s saying you&#39;ve done nothing with
[136.879s] this company um but that 97.4 billion
[140.16s] offer for open AI doesn&#39;t that seem
[142.599s] cheap I mean considering with the latest
[145.76s] uh funding expected to come in val about
[150.12s] just to kind of put it in your face Elon
[152.2s] you know take your money and shove it
[154.04s] all right Lauren thank you very much Tom
[155.519s] Hayes joins me now Tom I do love it when
[158.08s] billionaires have these spats
[159.599s] particularly ones that were were&#39;re
[160.92s] former partners I I wonder if some of it
[163.4s] though is being made up just in order to
[165.76s] get attention for what they&#39;re doing
[167.8s] well this is uh high stakes poker for
[170.0s] sure Elon Musk does not want to see soft
[172.519s] bank&#39;s $40 billion investment at a $260
[175.4s] billion valuation so we offered a third
[177.68s] So Soft bank will have to go back to
[179.0s] their shareholders and say no it&#39;s
[180.239s] really worth 260 billion it&#39;s not worth
[182.2s] 97 billion and Sam Alman going back well
[185.159s] you you paid 44 billion for for x uh
[188.159s] maybe it&#39;s only worth 9.7 billion so I I
[191.08s] think this is just back and forth but
[192.56s] the stakes are high what he should be
[194.4s] doing is making an offer for deep seek
[197.0s] uh and and getting that model at a at a
[199.08s] discount a significant discount to what
[201.2s] they&#39;re doing at open AI you&#39;ve got
[202.76s] faster models you&#39;re seeing it with
[204.72s] Alibaba if you believe them there&#39;s a
[207.44s] lot of these models from deep deep sake
[209.439s] are now being questioned whether they&#39;re
[211.08s] as good as they claimed they were that&#39;s
[212.56s] fair but you have competition from
[214.4s] Alibaba quen 2.5 is showing uh faster
[218.48s] faster performance in term against deep
[221.239s] seek Etc so there are a lot of models
[222.959s] coming from all over the world Stakes
[224.76s] are high everyone wants a piece of this
[226.48s] you wanted in deep seek Elon Musk those
[228.959s] are the open source models and Sam Alman
[231.36s] is closed Source model so I hear the
[233.48s] argument is for the open source which
[236.12s] might be the way to get everybody on
[237.599s] board and make this stuff move faster
[239.28s] next one bre does the threat of of the
[242.2s] Trump tariffs change your investment
[244.28s] policy at all yeah I think what we&#39;re
[246.0s] seeing um Trump is trying to even things
[249.079s] up our simple average tariffs are 3.3%
[252.2s] if you look at India they&#39;re 177% if you
[254.64s] look at Brazil they&#39;re 11% if you look
[256.6s] at China they&#39;re 7.5% so he&#39;s trying to
[258.959s] even things up what&#39;s this going to
[260.44s] affect steel and aluminum uh it&#39;s going
[262.36s] to affect heavy machinery it&#39;ll increase
[264.16s] the cost for Caterpillar deer it&#39;s
[266.68s] estimated and that&#39;s why that&#39;s why the
[268.44s] value of the stocks the US stocks that
[271.16s] that are in aluminum and steel have been
[273.16s] way up over the past couple of days yeah
[275.12s] in terms of the steel producers that&#39;s
[276.72s] going to help our national security Etc
[279.0s] in terms of the impact to the finished
[281.12s] goods caterpillar deer a lot of this is
[283.6s] already priced in they&#39;re not down that
[285.039s] much this morning and and that&#39;s a good
[286.56s] thing Tom Hayes great to see you thank
[288.199s] you very much for being here coming
[290.479s] up and we&#39;re back then I had the uh
[294.28s] pleasure to
[296.28s] join Oliver renick and Tom white on
[300.72s] Schwab Network to talk some Alibaba
[303.639s] thanks to Heidi Schultz we&#39;re going to
[305.52s] listen in
[307.84s] here all right we&#39;re looking at stocks
[309.919s] you&#39;re trying to catch a bid this
[311.44s] morning let&#39;s keep talking sell-offs and
[315.039s] dip buying opportunities one of them has
[317.36s] been in China as the trade starts to
[319.08s] firm back up joining us Thomas J Hayes
[322.4s] chairman and managing member at Great
[324.639s] Hill capital and Mr Tom white here with
[326.68s] me in studio uh Thomas you&#39;re looking
[328.68s] for dips to buy the China dip had uh
[331.72s] really been there the last year is it
[333.24s] starting to come back no question about
[336.0s] it Oliver thanks for having me uh we&#39;ve
[338.199s] been in Baba for almost 2 years now and
[341.88s] we are more investors than Traders so
[344.44s] we&#39;ve bought in the hundreds and we
[345.84s] bought a ton in the60s so our BAS is
[348.199s] around $83 this is an absolute
[350.88s] no-brainer we look at intrinsic value we
[353.319s] think is well in excess of $200 per
[356.0s] share uh this is the number one cloud
[359.08s] provider in China uh obviously you had
[362.199s] the announcement yesterday that apple is
[364.479s] going to be using alibaba&#39;s AI for uh
[368.24s] Apple intelligence which was a big news
[370.599s] but uh only part of the story here
[373.56s] complete play on the middle class
[375.16s] recovery with tbal and t-all as the one
[378.56s] and a half years of non-stop stimulus is
[381.4s] starting to kick in in the economy
[383.24s] International growing up 40% so there
[385.24s] are a lot of you know if you play poker
[386.759s] Oliver there are a lot of outs a lot of
[388.4s] things to low Alibaba and uh you know
[391.72s] it&#39;s had a huge move in the last few
[393.36s] weeks so probably consolidate for the
[395.639s] next few weeks but any weakness in the
[398.199s] coming months is an opportunity to buy
[399.8s] for the long term in our view love me
[401.919s] some outs but I also like equity and
[404.12s] getting my money in good uh is this a
[407.12s] draw you need something to come to
[409.0s] fruition here or is um the trade past
[413.039s] 120 basically a breakout because um
[416.919s] that&#39;s a level that has rejected Al Baba
[420.16s] time and time again basically
[422.96s] 120 yeah look we were buying Alibaba
[425.759s] before it was cool with David and
[427.68s] and he put 37% of his portfolio in China
[431.12s] uh certainly the 120 level has been a
[433.16s] been a a problem maybe we knock on the
[435.319s] door again and don&#39;t get through for a
[437.199s] few weeks for a couple of months take
[439.479s] that weakness cuz once we get through
[441.24s] they&#39;re not going to let anyone in this
[442.96s] is going to go to intrinsic value this
[444.879s] is a theme we&#39;ve seen this theme since
[447.44s] July of last year broadening what have
[449.28s] we seen the beginning of this year
[451.24s] Europe equities outperform us equities
[454.56s] uh equal weight have outperformed cap
[457.24s] weight mag 7 earnings growth is
[459.759s] decelerating and guess what China Tech
[462.44s] has outperformed US tech by a wide
[465.12s] margin this year we believe that trend
[467.08s] is going to continue and what most
[468.639s] people don&#39;t know is that&#39;s exactly what
[470.96s] happened in Trump 1.0 everyone thought
[473.72s] Chinese stocks would do horribly if you
[476.0s] look from 2017 and 2018 one of the
[478.68s] biggest runs in the shortest period of
[480.319s] time in Alibaba in Chinese Tech Etc so
[484.0s] so we really like the runway moving
[485.84s] forward any consolidation next next
[488.199s] couple of months great opportunity for
[489.84s] the long term some of the parts in our
[491.84s] view uh well over $200 a share such a
[495.0s] good point too on how China performed we
[496.96s] were hearing that from our own Jeff
[498.4s] Klein top Tom about International out
[501.36s] performance both on the year and the way
[503.96s] China traded uh in the first Trump term
[506.599s] you got a bot trade uh tell me what you
[508.759s] see in the options yeah well they&#39;ve got
[510.44s] earnings next Thursday so that&#39;s going
[511.96s] to be a key uh point to uh take a look
[514.719s] at maybe uh some weakness after the
[516.76s] games that we&#39;ve seen so far this year
[518.76s] up 18% just in February so it&#39;s had a
[521.159s] great run uh already so I looked at
[523.279s] something a little bit more conservative
[524.68s] in the option side trying to take
[526.16s] advantage of that higher implied
[527.399s] volatility level that we&#39;re seeing in
[529.519s] the shares after this runup and the
[532.08s] earnings event so going out to that
[533.6s] February 21st monthly cycle so just N9
[536.88s] days to expiration I&#39;m going to sell an
[538.44s] out of- the money put for vertical uh to
[540.519s] take advantage of a neutral to bullish
[542.32s] type stance here where I&#39;m going to sell
[544.2s] the 110 strike put and then buy the 105
[547.12s] strike put you want to stay risk toine
[548.8s] going into uh this event risk with
[551.36s] earnings uh $5 wide short neutral to
[553.92s] bullish put vertical collecting roughly
[555.72s] about $130 credit on it that&#39;s what you
[558.079s] can make on 130 bucks you&#39;ve got about
[561.56s] $370 in Risk on that one but it takes
[563.959s] your break even all the way down to
[566.2s] 10870 to the downside that&#39;s about 7%
[569.399s] below the current share price so you&#39;re
[571.04s] giving yourself that cushion to the
[572.519s] downside where you can profit in three
[574.48s] out of four scenarios uh on this move
[576.959s] but this is a really shortterm just a
[578.959s] trade to take advantage of that higher
[580.8s] implied volatility okay uh so there is
[583.8s] still a good bit of volatility in here
[585.44s] in the premium which I mean makes sense
[587.48s] this thing is moving fast yep and the
[589.68s] earnings next Thursday that&#39;s going to
[591.2s] be key okay uh man 80 to 116 in a hurry
[595.92s] this year for Alibaba what a what a wild
[598.079s] chart uh by the way that kind of U shape
[600.959s] almost a v from the October highs and
[603.64s] now back to them Hey Thomas one other
[605.72s] one you like here I want to make sure I
[607.519s] get your thoughts on is Paypal uh which
[610.279s] has come off and it&#39;s done it around
[612.12s] earnings uh pretty big gap down on the
[614.44s] last report what&#39; you make of that and
[616.079s] does it concern you at all yeah same
[618.72s] exact story we&#39;ve been in this one for a
[620.36s] while buying every single dip basis $62
[623.64s] it ran right up to $90 Alex Chris is an
[626.56s] unbelievable CEO came from into it uh
[629.959s] he&#39;s applied a lot of those same
[631.279s] strategies the reason the stock sold off
[633.24s] on earnings was the market was upset
[635.72s] that they feel that growth is slowing
[638.079s] it&#39;s not slowing he&#39;s firing
[640.16s] unprofitable customers because he wants
[642.56s] to generate free cash flow and buyback
[645.44s] stock they did $6.8 billion dollar of
[647.959s] free cash flow in 2024 he&#39;s sandbagging
[650.72s] again in 2025 setting expectations low 6
[654.2s] to 7 billion of free cash flow if last
[656.36s] year&#39;s any prologue in terms of his
[658.279s] sandbagging they&#39;ll probably do 8
[660.2s] billion of free cash flow look this is a
[662.04s] $75 billion market cap they just
[664.2s] announced they&#39;re going to buy $15
[665.839s] billion worth of stock they&#39;re going to
[667.48s] buy in 20% of the company they&#39;ve got
[670.16s] venmo is a verb they&#39;ve got fast lane
[672.959s] checkout that&#39;s doing phenomenal this
[675.0s] business is going to be great great
[676.44s] leader great turnaround story it&#39;ll be
[678.16s] back up to 90 we estimate intrinsic
[680.32s] value up around 120 it may take a year
[682.56s] to two years to get there this is a high
[684.92s] quality durable growing business that&#39;s
[687.16s] generating cash like it&#39;s going out of
[688.76s] style convincing and I like to hear it
[691.12s] because uh my narrative on PayPal has
[692.76s] been pretty similar I was kind of
[694.279s] confused why the stock was so hated for
[697.12s] basically you know uh 18 out of the last
[699.92s] 24 months so seems like it has totally
[703.6s] revamped the way we bank and the way we
[705.88s] move money around thanks a lot Thomas
[708.0s] appreciate the conviction calls and the
[710.04s] details there and of course a nice poker
[712.24s] reference always a good way to get on my
[713.76s] good side Tom give me a PayPal trade
[716.2s] well I know why the stock was down
[717.68s] because they&#39;re uh they&#39;re uh you know
[719.8s] users across all their platforms was
[721.92s] actually decelerating but as Thomas
[724.72s] mentioned the new CEO Alex Chris is
[727.72s] making some uh solid changes and good
[729.959s] Partnerships here so I looked at
[731.24s] something a little bit more aggressive
[732.519s] here but giving myself duration the
[734.24s] stocks pulled back about 11% so far this
[736.959s] year after that poor earnings report and
[739.36s] it wasn&#39;t a bad report it was just poor
[741.6s] guidance and maybe uh some profit taking
[744.24s] after that big runup uh but I looked at
[746.44s] something a little bit more aggressive
[747.68s] going out a couple months to the April
[749.24s] monthly cycle uh so you&#39;ve got about 64
[751.72s] days till expiration on this one where
[753.76s] I&#39;m going to buy the at the money 75
[755.68s] strike call and then to offset some of
[757.88s] the cost because maybe it goes up but
[759.839s] maybe it just doesn&#39;t explode back to 90
[761.76s] bucks sell the 85 strike call so a
[764.04s] bullish $10 wide call vertical to the
[766.399s] upside you&#39;re paying roughly about a 340
[769.12s] debit for that so that&#39;s going to be
[770.44s] your risk on that trade takes your break
[772.16s] even up to 7840 on this one that&#39;s only
[776.72s] uh about 4% above the current share
[778.72s] price so you don&#39;t need a monster move
[780.24s] to the upside you just expect over the
[782.519s] next couple months that we&#39;re going to
[783.639s] start making up some of those losses
[785.639s] that we&#39;ve seen uh post earnings on this
[787.8s] one uh but pretty straightforward and
[789.92s] because you&#39;re buying the vertical
[791.48s] Oliver you have a little bit more
[792.959s] flexibility as far as trade management
[794.72s] so if the stock does pop up towards you
[797.36s] know above 80 bucks a share and this
[799.199s] thing expands to maybe double you can
[801.44s] start taking off parts of your position
[803.639s] or the entire position ahead of
[805.92s] expiration you don&#39;t have to wait for it
[807.76s] because you&#39;re buying the vertical and
[809.32s] gives you some flexibility all right all
[811.68s] right buying a call vertical buying
[813.32s] upside baa buying it in PayPal and um
[817.44s] taking advantage of volatility where
[818.76s] it&#39;s elevated um more elevated in Baba
[822.0s] it seems like okay thanks for the
[835.12s] trades and we&#39;re back and then finally I
[838.32s] had a chance to join Kristen Scher
[840.6s] always have great interviews with her
[842.32s] General market overview couple picks
[844.6s] want to thank Mel montz Jeff Cohen for
[847.92s] having me on we&#39;ll listen in here
[850.079s] joining me in studio is our Market
[852.639s] expert today Thomas hay he&#39;s the chair
[854.72s] managing member at Great Hill Capital
[856.88s] Thomas great to have you great to be
[858.48s] here Kristen so a lot to digest of
[860.56s] course a choppy but higher starts of the
[863.44s] year now this inflation report stocks
[865.8s] set to drop about 1% at the open what
[868.36s] are the takeaways
[869.839s] well I think a couple of things I think
[871.24s] Goldman Sachs and JP Morgan set up the
[873.44s] street they said if it came in this hot
[875.199s] the market was going to be down 1 and a
[876.8s] 12% to 2% it&#39;s kind of consistent with
[879.72s] the February seasonality uh this is the
[882.24s] second worst month of the year
[884.279s] historically and in a postelection year
[886.92s] February is down on average 1.3% so I
[890.04s] think we got to buckle up buttercup this
[892.0s] might be a little bit of uh turbulence
[893.92s] here for the next few weeks uh there
[895.92s] will be a knee-jerk reaction to the
[897.959s] inflation report 10e yield was at 480
[901.04s] went down to 450 now it&#39;s back at 463 do
[904.6s] we go back and test 480 again maybe
[907.199s] maybe not we&#39;re not going to five uh
[909.68s] bessin and Trump have already said they
[911.279s] want to Target the 10-year yield uh so I
[914.6s] think actually what you&#39;re going to see
[916.279s] before we get to five we might actually
[917.92s] move to four because there are
[920.399s] deflationary actions in place namely
[923.759s] with Doge they are cutting costs with a
[926.44s] machete they are laying off a lot of
[928.44s] people that&#39;s going to be deflationary
[929.88s] that&#39;s going to hurt the the jobs Market
[931.6s] a little bit uh that will offset but
[933.56s] we&#39;re not going to see that right away
[934.72s] so right now it&#39;s an immediate knee-jerk
[936.519s] reaction to inflation and we&#39;re going to
[938.16s] see that today yeah so uh just in about
[941.079s] two hours one hour I guess we&#39;ll hear
[942.8s] from the FED chare uh here on the East
[945.16s] Coast but I am curious Thomas how
[947.079s] tariffs factor into this because since
[949.04s] the last time we spoke we have heard a
[951.24s] wave of tariff tariffs announced by the
[953.48s] administration yeah if you if you look
[955.68s] at the effect of tariffs historically
[958.12s] you do get shortterm pop in prices
[961.399s] intermediate term it normalizes and
[963.16s] actually if you look at washing machines
[965.0s] and so on uh shortly thereafter actually
[968.04s] prices are lower a couple of years out
[970.079s] so it&#39;s kind of a short short-term
[971.48s] impact in terms of the tariffs uh again
[974.279s] volatility that we&#39;re we&#39;re going to see
[975.959s] here with the new Administration and new
[977.639s] headline every day welcome to Trump 2.0
[980.12s] same as Trump 1.0 a new tweet a new new
[982.639s] set of volatility so let&#39;s talk about
[984.44s] some of your picks within the backdrop
[987.12s] of this Market yeah so uh when we came
[989.72s] on uh uh early this year we said that
[992.6s] this is going to be a different type of
[993.6s] year mag mag 7 is not going to be the
[995.519s] leader we&#39;re going to see broadening
[997.199s] well what has happened in the first 6
[999.079s] weeks here uh the 493 equal weight has
[1002.199s] outperformed the mag 7 cap weight so
[1004.88s] that&#39;s new Europe equities have actually
[1007.959s] outperformed us equities and value has
[1011.199s] outperformed growth three things that
[1012.68s] weren&#39;t on most people&#39;s Bingo cards but
[1014.56s] they heard it right here on Kristen
[1015.92s] scholer show at the live at the NYSC so
[1018.319s] that&#39;s going to continue so what&#39;s up
[1019.88s] next I think what could be up next is
[1021.92s] small cap starts to outperform large cap
[1024.6s] uh and Emerging Markets start to
[1026.76s] outperform develop markets why because
[1029.6s] you&#39;re getting earnings growth for lower
[1031.16s] multiples in all those areas that are
[1032.6s] starting to broaden out and starting to
[1034.36s] outperform uh this inflation report is
[1037.959s] going to be an opportunity for dividend
[1040.48s] yielders so yields are going to blow out
[1042.88s] they&#39;re going to get sold off in the
[1044.36s] next couple of days and then you want to
[1045.799s] buy some of these defensive stocks one
[1048.199s] that we like is crown castle it has a 7%
[1051.44s] dividend yield 40,000 cell phone towers
[1055.039s] they are a leader in that business but
[1057.08s] what&#39;s been holding them back is their
[1059.039s] fiber business is very Capital intensive
[1061.799s] takes a lot of investment and a very low
[1064.28s] return on that investment Capital
[1065.64s] they&#39;re selling that off to Z group for
[1067.28s] $8 billion that&#39;ll enable them to buy
[1069.28s] back stock pay down debt it&#39;ll be a
[1071.32s] great thing for shareholders 7% pretty
[1073.44s] impressive right especially in this
[1075.08s] environment where high yield savings is
[1077.2s] maybe yielding you 3 and a half% and
[1079.32s] bonds would be lower as well correct and
[1081.64s] you have capital appreciation potential
[1083.44s] once they get rid of that albatross
[1085.48s] around their neck uh this stock can
[1087.36s] really move up quite a bit so you get
[1088.96s] paid while you wait you get some capital
[1090.76s] appreciation over the next two years
[1092.559s] next couple of days use this opportunity
[1094.2s] to take advantage what does this mean
[1095.919s] for
[1096.919s] deals yeah the overall market look this
[1100.28s] Market is primed for a lot of IPO paper
[1103.2s] in the next 12 to 24 months in the short
[1105.679s] term you&#39;re probably not going to get
[1106.919s] your deal out in the next couple of
[1108.24s] weeks we&#39;re have a little rockiness a
[1110.0s] little bit of
[1110.88s] volatility um another defensive stock
[1114.0s] that we&#39;re looking at in this context is
[1115.84s] horel the maker of spam of of all things
[1119.4s] spam spam horel chili all the protein
[1122.559s] snacks that people need whether they&#39;re
[1124.6s] just normally eating or whether they&#39;re
[1126.0s] on gp1s which is the new trend uh they
[1128.48s] want high protein stuff uh Skippy
[1130.6s] Planters Etc this has been kind of
[1132.64s] mismanaged since 2016 that CEO is
[1135.4s] leaving Jim C uh it&#39;s got a 3.7%
[1138.919s] dividend yield and they&#39;ve been raising
[1140.4s] the dividend every single year for 59
[1142.6s] years it&#39;s a dividend Aristocrat now
[1144.52s] that is a serious track record right
[1146.2s] that&#39;s right 59 years is a long way so
[1148.24s] let&#39;s talk a bit about bonds Thomas I
[1149.799s] know you mentioned obviously dividend
[1151.84s] stocks how do bonds look to you at these
[1154.2s] levels yeah so I think you&#39;ll get this
[1156.12s] knee-jerk you&#39;re going to get an
[1157.44s] intermediate term selloff right now
[1160.039s] 10-year yields probably going to go back
[1161.559s] up to 480 somewhere in that neighborhood
[1164.0s] any weakness in bonds is to be bought
[1166.76s] okay the deflationary forces of Doge uh
[1169.88s] and cutting and Etc and the Slowdown
[1172.12s] that uh could could be short-term impact
[1174.919s] of tariffs you could get a slowing of
[1176.96s] growth as well uh will be an opportunity
[1179.08s] to buy bonds right now there were two
[1181.52s] crowded trades coming into this year
[1183.24s] number one was long mag 7 what&#39;s been
[1185.08s] the worst performer mag 7 the second
[1187.12s] most crowd trade is short bonds everyone
[1189.84s] shorting Bonds in the whole today
[1191.159s] they&#39;re going to feel smart in four
[1192.76s] weeks they&#39;re not going to be so happy
[1194.2s] interesting so would you buy the dip uh
[1196.64s] in bonds for sure in the next few days
[1198.159s] I&#39;d be buying bonds left and right if we
[1199.96s] see uh underperformance in February
[1201.919s] historically which is what happens what
[1203.44s] about that for equities for equities for
[1205.2s] sure this is where you want to get out
[1206.44s] your shopping list in the next two weeks
[1207.76s] you&#39;re going to have opportunities to
[1208.72s] buy great businesses it&#39;s no impact this
[1211.08s] will be a tiny little blip on the screen
[1212.76s] when you look back three three months
[1214.12s] from now use this as an opportunity this
[1216.0s] is how you make money you you don&#39;t sell
[1218.44s] in the hole you buy in the hole when
[1219.96s] you&#39;re buying high quality businesses
[1221.44s] Kristen Thomas hay chair and managing
[1223.679s] member of great Hill Capital Thomas
[1225.4s] always a pleasure and thanks for joining
[1226.6s] me in studio thanks for having me great
[1228.28s] to have you
[1230.559s] and we&#39;re back so now you have pretty
[1232.919s] much the general overview finally want
[1234.919s] to thank uh shawat chuhan and sucti gupa
[1239.64s] for including me in their article on
[1241.36s] Reuters and let&#39;s get to the quotes of
[1244.559s] the week uh this is from Peter Lynch
[1246.919s] when stocks are attractive you buy them
[1248.44s] sure they can go lower uh he says I&#39;ve
[1250.44s] bought stocks at $12 that went to $2 but
[1252.799s] later went to 30 you just don&#39;t know
[1254.36s] when you can find the bottom the key is
[1256.28s] knowing the underlying fundamentals
[1258.159s] knowing what you own which we cover
[1259.72s] every single week Charlie Munger the big
[1261.72s] money is not in the buying or the
[1263.0s] selling but in the waiting uh we&#39;re
[1264.96s] seeing that play out with Alibaba for
[1267.0s] sure and then Peter Lynch the trick is
[1269.32s] not to learn to trust your gut feelings
[1271.32s] but rather to discipline yourself to
[1273.08s] ignore them Stand by Your stocks as long
[1275.559s] as the fundamental story of the company
[1278.159s] hasn&#39;t changed so we&#39;re going to cover
[1280.4s] some of that let&#39;s get down to uh
[1283.0s] economic Market data here um missed a
[1286.88s] couple photos here this was uh Mimi
[1289.4s] trying steak tartar for her first time
[1291.72s] ever at Eddie V&#39;s which was UN best
[1293.76s] steak tartar I&#39;ve ever had didn&#39;t think
[1295.159s] that was going to happen that&#39;s in front
[1296.919s] of the New York Stock Exchange that&#39;s in
[1299.0s] the vanney studio and I and that&#39;s with
[1301.0s] my buddy Kenny pocari I got to do his
[1303.08s] show on Yahoo finance that&#39;ll be out
[1305.52s] next week uh in front of Fox on the desk
[1309.559s] at Varan Co so I share that for the new
[1312.039s] people tuning in for the first time give
[1313.679s] you a behind the-scenes look you can see
[1316.039s] here I look the best in this photo out
[1317.88s] of all of them because of wonderful
[1319.96s] Yasha does Works her makeup Magic on me
[1323.4s] and we got to talk about all different
[1325.279s] brands you can guess which brands I
[1327.12s] asked her about which she was pretty uh
[1329.72s] upbeat on which is pretty good to see uh
[1332.679s] okay let&#39;s get down to data analysts are
[1334.32s] raising European earnings forecasts uh
[1337.96s] value has outperformed growth uh and
[1341.96s] Europe has outperformed the US and 493
[1345.159s] has outperformed mag 7 so far this year
[1347.799s] this has been a theme we&#39;ve been
[1348.84s] pounding the table when it was unpopular
[1351.36s] now everyone is coming on board and
[1353.039s] that&#39;s the beginning of a trend you can
[1355.159s] see these mag s Mania question mark you
[1358.279s] can see previous bubbles whether it was
[1360.799s] oil whether it was home prices whether
[1363.24s] it was a NASDAQ in 200000 whether it was
[1365.32s] the Nik in the late 80s uh gold in the
[1367.919s] 70s nifty50 in the 60s Etc it doesn&#39;t
[1371.24s] mean that it&#39;s going to crash down like
[1373.159s] the all of these did it just means that
[1375.679s] there may be better places for
[1377.279s] outperformance in the 12 to 24 months
[1379.72s] and that&#39;s been our theme we started
[1381.0s] pounding the table in Q4 a lot of you
[1383.44s] came in uh uh early this year and I was
[1386.72s] you know I
[1388.039s] never um promote you know uh people
[1391.559s] coming in they come in or they don&#39;t
[1392.76s] come in I it makes no difference for me
[1394.559s] I eat one cheeseburger a day it&#39;s fine
[1396.6s] but uh a lot of you came in for q1 at
[1399.72s] the right time because I I emphasized it
[1401.88s] and and it&#39;s just been a rocket ship uh
[1404.039s] right after the inauguration based on
[1405.679s] how we&#39;re positioned not for the General
[1407.24s] market overall uh and um and that&#39;s
[1410.32s] pretty exciting so uh and for existing
[1412.559s] clients uh also super duper exciting so
[1415.159s] percent of S&amp;P 500 total market cap with
[1417.559s] price to sales greater than 10x again
[1419.64s] this points to some of the extremes like
[1421.559s] I just shared on some of those previous
[1423.88s] historic bubbles um you know this was
[1427.039s] the
[1429.32s] basically if you go back you know 100
[1432.799s] years this was one of the this was the
[1434.679s] only decade where you could buy a basket
[1436.64s] of stocks trading at 10 10 time sales
[1439.6s] and actually outperform the S&amp;P 500 uh
[1442.159s] historically every decade it&#39;s pretty
[1443.96s] much a guaranteed way to lose 90% of
[1445.72s] your money in two to three years um and
[1448.88s] that was a function of Zer we&#39;re not
[1450.4s] going back to Zer any anytime soon uh
[1452.96s] you saw the inflation numbers yesterday
[1455.0s] however uh January of the last two years
[1457.84s] is surprised to the upside so don&#39;t
[1459.799s] expect that to persist you got a lot of
[1461.24s] people getting laid off with Doge they
[1462.72s] going to be counter trending forces uh
[1465.36s] but we&#39;re not going back to zero
[1466.919s] interest rate policy moving along PE S&amp;P
[1471.72s] PE ratio on a trailing 12month operating
[1475.039s] EPS uh again you know going back to
[1480.0s] 1940 uh growth versus value extremes
[1483.159s] like we saw in 200000 1940 and uh 2022
[1489.08s] just before we had the tech crash in
[1490.72s] 2022 where we were able to buy Alibaba
[1493.84s] and Google at huge discounts in in
[1495.88s] October 2022 when no one wanted them at
[1498.64s] easy doubles and then uh now we&#39;re
[1501.2s] getting back to those extremes so here
[1503.88s] you go a lot of people are coming on to
[1505.64s] our point of view why because the price
[1507.48s] is down 20% on a lot of these names
[1509.799s] opinion follows Trend they didn&#39;t tell
[1511.44s] you ahead of time they told you after
[1512.76s] the fact but uh better late than never I
[1515.36s] guess total returns 2000 to 2006 small
[1519.64s] cap value
[1521.48s] 16.6% annualize 185% cumulative returns
[1525.559s] I think we&#39;re setting up to an
[1526.64s] environment just like this small cap has
[1528.399s] not outperformed large cap year-to date
[1530.399s] yet even though Europe has outperformed
[1533.08s] uh us and 493 is outperformed uh mag 7
[1537.799s] and all the other things are starting to
[1539.24s] play out I think that&#39;s the next phase I
[1541.559s] think Emerging Markets is already
[1543.279s] happening China Tech is dramatically
[1545.2s] outperforming US tech us mag 7 uh and up
[1549.32s] until a day or two ago Tech was the only
[1552.32s] sector in the US negative or flat on the
[1555.08s] year so uh you know seeing Healthcare
[1557.52s] remember the last be first some of the
[1559.6s] materials are starting to perk up Etc uh
[1562.279s] also during that period when Amazon was
[1564.159s] dropping 80 80 90% Cisco was getting
[1566.84s] bashed Enron uh Worldcom all the
[1569.679s] Darlings Global Crossing uh value was up
[1572.6s] 69% during that period uh S&amp;P did fine
[1576.679s] because the weights came down uh but
[1579.2s] underperformed getting the right
[1580.799s] exposure with small cap in international
[1583.399s] uh this table doesn&#39;t have international
[1585.12s] but dramatic outperformance in China
[1587.279s] during that period and uh I continue to
[1590.0s] reemphasize these themes because number
[1591.64s] one it&#39;s working and number two it&#39;s
[1593.08s] just math and understanding everything
[1595.279s] is cyclical and um if you pay attention
[1598.32s] to extremes rather than chase them you
[1600.44s] can make incredible uh uh returns over
[1603.919s] time so postelection year seasonal
[1607.2s] pattern this is when we get the chop the
[1609.279s] second half of February hang on to your
[1611.159s] horses that might be in the indices it
[1613.399s] may not necessarily be in all the names
[1615.799s] but don&#39;t expect miracles I mean we&#39;ve
[1617.679s] had some really big down days in the
[1619.72s] market uh the last 6 weeks and our
[1621.72s] portfolios have been up on those days so
[1623.559s] we&#39;re just positioned perfectly so far
[1626.44s] uh but um uh February June September you
[1631.72s] got to expect draw downs and that&#39;s just
[1633.52s] the way it is and uh you just hold your
[1636.6s] businesses if you lik them two weeks ago
[1638.919s] uh you&#39;re going to love them in the next
[1640.24s] two weeks so uh evolution of Atlanta fed
[1643.559s] GDP now you know it&#39;s interesting about
[1645.679s] Alibaba it actually shot up to like like
[1649.36s] 127 overnight so it broke through that
[1652.0s] 120 barrier and I was thinking wow well
[1655.24s] I&#39;ll take that I mean I I was on the
[1657.159s] morning before saying hey we&#39;re you know
[1659.159s] knocking up on this 120 here don&#39;t be
[1661.84s] surprised if we consolidate these gains
[1663.6s] for a couple of months and shake out all
[1665.6s] the people chasing back up at 120 and
[1667.519s] scare them out at you know low 100s or
[1670.48s] or 110 or something like that uh just
[1672.919s] like every single move and then once we
[1674.76s] break through 120 materially just you
[1676.76s] know they won&#39;t let anyone in is what I
[1678.6s] said on Schwab with Oliver and Tom uh
[1682.84s] and we just busted through it last night
[1685.2s] came back in this morning uh I think
[1687.399s] finished up pretty strong looks like
[1690.159s] about yeah 119 and change so I would not
[1692.559s] be shocked if we can solidate that
[1694.76s] because a lot of people chased up
[1696.24s] overnight last night and got smashed or
[1698.32s] down 10 points already so they&#39;ll be
[1700.44s] panicking out of their fomo margin and
[1703.519s] um and that&#39;s that so um uh don&#39;t worry
[1707.519s] about that everything is on track with
[1709.44s] that theme evolution of Atlanta fed GDP
[1713.32s] now at about 3% not stuff you see in
[1715.72s] recessions here are the Cycle composits
[1718.48s] 14 and 10 years going back
[1721.76s] to
[1723.559s] uh
[1729.32s] 19 uh let&#39;s see it&#39;s probably going back
[1733.84s] to
[1734.96s] 1950 and this is that chop in the second
[1737.32s] two half so bun stuff pointing to that
[1739.279s] but we told you that in the last few
[1740.559s] weeks so just be be aware and when it
[1743.399s] happens don&#39;t be surprised and just sit
[1745.24s] tight nothing changed to the underlying
[1747.64s] businesses uh AFC winners have been good
[1750.2s] for the Bulls lately
[1753.44s] yeah this is an after Thea thing before
[1755.96s] the fact they said if Philadelphia wins
[1757.72s] it&#39;s going to be the end of the world uh
[1760.2s] you know it&#39;s it&#39;s coincident not causal
[1762.519s] I hope you don&#39;t believe it&#39;s causal or
[1764.799s] um you know my condolences uh to your
[1767.48s] Investment Group here uh progression of
[1770.2s] magnificent 7th quarterly sales
[1771.799s] surprises this is something that hasn&#39;t
[1773.279s] happened since 2022 when you had the
[1775.44s] tech wreck uh which is you
[1779.679s] had uh zero percentage of sales
[1784.279s] surprises okay quarterly sales surprises
[1786.919s] so in aggregate so that&#39;s a that&#39;s a
[1789.519s] thing and then uh magnificent 7 year-to
[1793.919s] date was -3 basis points while the xmag
[1797.36s] 7 was 2
[1798.799s] 2.8% and the S&amp;P 500 2.7% this actually
[1802.84s] got more extreme what date is that uh as
[1806.679s] of anyway uh and then you can see here
[1809.6s] what we cover every single week S&amp;P
[1813.0s] earnings growth of the unmagnify is
[1816.12s] growing mag 7 is decelerating multiple
[1819.32s] is still too high hasn&#39;t derated enough
[1821.799s] yet whereas this multiple is low and
[1824.32s] should start to play catch up and rate
[1826.799s] over time
[1828.96s] uh the outperformance of The Magnificent
[1830.32s] 7 has historically reflected its earning
[1832.96s] superiority 2025 Bottoms Up estimates
[1835.559s] imply excess earnings growth uh will
[1837.84s] narrow for the Magnificent 7 32
[1840.76s] percentage points in uh oh it was 32
[1844.679s] percentage points excess in 2024 to only
[1847.36s] six in 2025 and four in 2026 so
[1849.919s] decelerating earnings growth uh huge
[1852.64s] premium multiple 33 times versus 22
[1855.88s] times for the S&amp;P versus Maybe 18 times
[1858.72s] for The X mag 7 or equal
[1861.639s] weight and then if you look at small
[1864.039s] versus large International versus
[1865.799s] demestic that the spreads are even
[1867.279s] larger and the chickens are coming home
[1869.0s] to roost and uh we are gathering
[1871.6s] chickens like it&#39;s going out of style uh
[1873.84s] is the tide turning returns through 25
[1877.279s] 2025 this is Europe versus the S&amp;P 500
[1881.24s] dramatic out
[1882.679s] performance uh it looks like about 7 8%
[1885.84s] excuse me uh looks like about 3 4%
[1888.559s] outperformance already year to date
[1891.0s] percentage of international buyers in
[1893.039s] Los Angeles County so this is Chinese
[1896.799s] buyers um parking money you can see this
[1901.2s] is starting you know this peak during
[1902.84s] covid this is starting to diminish I
[1904.519s] think this is going to diminish even
[1906.36s] further it&#39;s funny when we bought a
[1908.279s] house out here I said to my wife I was
[1910.2s] like you know so you want me to buy the
[1911.88s] top in in Orange County and sell the
[1913.679s] bottom in Connecticut uh maybe you
[1916.08s] haven&#39;t been paying attention to do what
[1917.559s] to what I do for a living for over two
[1919.6s] decades and how how we have the ability
[1921.399s] to do all this uh but uh we played the
[1925.159s] smart game we rented out Connecticut so
[1926.96s] that can appreciate uh the houses there
[1929.32s] and uh we got a nice situation here but
[1932.6s] I think that Orange County real estate
[1935.84s] uh if passes any prologue looking back
[1937.679s] to the Japanese uh and the Orange County
[1940.36s] housing crisis in the early 90s I think
[1942.48s] what&#39;s happening now is the Chinese were
[1945.519s] panicked when they were in lockdown
[1946.76s] getting their money out anyway which way
[1948.2s] they could easy way to park it they got
[1950.559s] a ton in Los Angeles but even more in
[1952.2s] Orange County Newport particularly in
[1954.6s] the nice areas and they&#39;re just most of
[1956.2s] them are empty it&#39;s just a store of
[1958.159s] value for them with a negative
[1960.159s] carry um and I think as equities take
[1964.08s] off and they see new opportunities and
[1966.24s] the the re the regulation has come back
[1969.12s] in down and the stimulus has gone up I
[1972.519s] think they&#39;re going to get serious fomo
[1974.08s] fomo is a universal thing it&#39;s not by uh
[1977.639s] uh nationality it&#39;s it&#39;s a human
[1980.519s] condition uh most people get the the
[1982.919s] fomo gene I was blessed not to get the
[1985.399s] fomo Gene and um I think the marginal
[1989.639s] Chinese buyer parking their money is
[1991.919s] going to be less incentivized to get
[1993.519s] money out of China in the next year to
[1995.159s] two when everything is going up
[1997.039s] property&#39;s recovering you you&#39;re going
[1998.639s] to talk about some of the Articles stock
[2000.519s] markets recovering they&#39;re going to want
[2001.799s] to make these incredible returns and
[2004.08s] like everyone else opinion follows Trend
[2005.799s] now they&#39;re going to get excited about
[2007.279s] China so it&#39;s not that they&#39;re going to
[2009.279s] sell everything and bring the money back
[2010.799s] to China because it&#39;s so hard to get out
[2012.519s] but the marginal buyer is going to
[2013.679s] continue to decline and once that final
[2016.0s] bit marginal bid evaporates it&#39;s it&#39;s a
[2019.039s] huge air pocket and um so uh so we&#39;ll
[2023.159s] see what happens and there could be
[2024.519s] interesting opportunities in the next
[2026.24s] few years out here
[2029.799s] uh Bank of America bull bear indicator
[2033.48s] not what you see at extremes here is the
[2035.24s] multi-year Twin Peaks in Long data
[2036.919s] treasury bonds we&#39;ve covered this this
[2038.639s] is the most important
[2040.159s] Point uh in my view these dollar and
[2044.039s] treasury fake outs are going to get
[2046.32s] reversed bessent and Trump have said as
[2048.72s] much they&#39;re going to focus on that doge
[2050.599s] is moving ahead at a break neck speed
[2052.599s] they&#39;re laying off a lot of people take
[2054.44s] people a lot of people taking packages
[2056.32s] that are not necessarily going to be
[2057.919s] absorbed by the uh private sector
[2061.079s] because they probably don&#39;t have um a
[2063.679s] decent portion of them don&#39;t have uh
[2065.399s] transferable skills um
[2068.399s] to earn commensurate income and they&#39;re
[2070.2s] going to think that anyway the point is
[2073.079s] that their deflationary forces intact
[2077.599s] which is going to be very good for bond
[2079.079s] yields coming down which is going to be
[2080.399s] very and dollar coming down which is
[2081.76s] going to be very good for
[2083.359s] international tariffs here still at
[2085.56s] 100-year lows uh went up for 12 years
[2088.44s] before you
[2089.52s] saw smooth Holly so people who keep
[2092.0s] pointing to small hully Smoot Holly
[2094.56s] haven&#39;t read history books you had 10
[2096.44s] years of prosperity with tariffs
[2097.8s] increasing uh reciprocal tariffs is a
[2100.0s] great idea because the net effect is
[2101.76s] most people are going to want tariffs to
[2103.48s] come down so rather than us our tariffs
[2105.48s] going up theirs are going to come down
[2107.24s] it&#39;s going to be more free trading and
[2109.359s] uh better for velocity of money globally
[2111.52s] which increases the standard of
[2113.16s] living China less reliant on US exports
[2116.04s] today so they&#39;re not you know it&#39;s only
[2117.56s] 2.8% of their GDP so they&#39;re not going
[2120.28s] to really be bullied that you saw them
[2122.28s] do the reciprocal tariff so I think
[2124.64s] there&#39;s going to be more incentive to
[2126.2s] cooperate versus not talk and blame like
[2128.92s] the previous administration uh which
[2131.04s] caused an awful lot of problems and um
[2134.16s] uh the most important problem that it
[2135.76s] created in my view is deep seek because
[2138.119s] once you block them from having chips
[2140.28s] they you know necessity is the mother of
[2141.96s] invention now they&#39;re independent and on
[2143.76s] many metrics they&#39;re outperforming us at
[2146.119s] the moment that won&#39;t necessarily
[2148.24s] continue but they will have something
[2150.64s] comparable where they can compete and we
[2152.839s] saw it in alibaba&#39;s announcement Etc AI
[2156.28s] capex relief for semis you see Intel
[2160.319s] going straight through the roof with JD
[2161.839s] Vance&#39;s comments which is pretty
[2163.68s] exciting weak demand uh are tracking at
[2166.92s] the lowest level in over two years so
[2169.0s] that&#39;s good mentions of a bottom sword
[2171.319s] in 20 24% year on year the biggest jump
[2174.599s] in history uh so those are the type of
[2177.28s] things you saw at the covid lows at the
[2179.24s] great financial crisis lows uh and this
[2182.16s] is you know by and large the
[2185.119s] 493 companies the non- magn UNM
[2188.079s] magnificent 493 are the ones saying
[2190.599s] mentions of a bottom so that&#39;s positive
[2193.359s] for the rest of the indices which means
[2195.16s] you could see subdued index with still
[2196.92s] the overweight in mag 7 but the rest of
[2199.44s] the company&#39;s doing extremely well not
[2201.24s] moving the needle on the indices for all
[2202.88s] the people that are crowded in into the
[2205.079s] crowded passive trade uh but really
[2207.839s] exciting for the people in the active
[2210.04s] management uh earnings are expected to
[2212.119s] broaden out from
[2214.119s] here we see now see the data here
[2217.68s] percentage of stocks outgrowing the mag
[2219.56s] 7 is climbing again in a material way uh
[2224.0s] just like you saw in 2020 and 2021 which
[2227.24s] is awesome time and also in 2014 through
[2231.839s] 2 this doesn&#39;t really go back far enough
[2233.96s] but it&#39;s a positive thing again I can&#39;t
[2236.56s] reemphasize this chart and not ladies
[2238.52s] and gentlemen decelerating earnings
[2240.24s] withow mag 7 accelerating earning growth
[2243.0s] 493 and um similar situation in terms of
[2246.359s] prices what you pay values what you get
[2248.52s] uh International versus us that cycle is
[2250.64s] going to come back we&#39;ve shown that
[2252.119s] chart a few times hyperscalers capex
[2254.88s] growth to remain strong in 2025 people
[2256.92s] view that as a positive the problem is
[2259.079s] is in the intermediate term call it two
[2260.96s] to three years we&#39;re seeing 0% return on
[2264.24s] invested capital and what it&#39;s doing is
[2266.68s] it&#39;s crowding out money for BuyBacks
[2268.96s] which has been a huge part of the stock
[2270.88s] growth and it&#39;s lowering the return on
[2273.319s] invested Capital which is uh
[2276.44s] forcing analyst to start to think
[2279.0s] reating now it may be true that 5 years
[2282.04s] from now they are going to have a return
[2283.319s] on invested Capital like none other but
[2285.359s] right now for everyone thinks that this
[2288.119s] is the opportunity of a lifetime this is
[2289.52s] fomo defensive spending not to get left
[2292.2s] in the dust they don&#39;t know what the
[2293.839s] return is going to be or how it&#39;s going
[2295.0s] to be my guess is it will be great but
[2296.839s] it will be many years out so in the
[2298.319s] meantime like when you saw meta go down
[2300.72s] to $8 when
[2304.24s] um uh
[2306.28s] Zuckerberg would was going to spend
[2308.16s] billions on the metaverse uh once
[2311.599s] shareholders saw that there was no
[2314.44s] return they basically revolted and he
[2317.2s] finally got the message and he flipped
[2318.48s] around and it&#39;s just been a home run
[2319.64s] ever since um hyperscale is capex as a
[2323.76s] percentage of operating cash flows
[2325.0s] expected to remain high again that&#39;s
[2326.96s] going to impact margins return on
[2328.24s] invested capital and ultimately the
[2330.16s] multiple CEO is expecting higher capex
[2332.8s] over the next 6 months Rose to the
[2334.0s] highest level since Q4 2022 this is part
[2336.76s] of our manufacturing recovery theme
[2340.28s] manufacturing has been in a depression
[2341.68s] for 2
[2344.28s] years mag s stocks haven&#39;t been able to
[2346.72s] keep Pace with the broader market so far
[2349.92s] and uh we think at the end of the year
[2351.839s] we&#39;ll look back that will be the case
[2353.0s] for the full year Chinese investors
[2354.839s] snapping up Hong Kong stocks that was
[2356.44s] part of our core thesis with the Dual
[2359.56s] listing that the Chinese were going to
[2361.0s] be able to buy more and more through the
[2362.359s] stock connect that has been the case
[2364.119s] especially for Baba uh just rocketing
[2366.72s] overnight uh I&#39;d love to see it just
[2368.92s] hovering here between 119 and 108 for
[2372.64s] the next two months and just scare
[2374.119s] everyone out and uh get phone calls like
[2376.64s] oh is it going to hit the resistance
[2378.64s] again blah blah blah uh while the fund
[2381.2s] so maybe maybe earnings they&#39;ll be
[2383.04s] conservative and that&#39;ll be the excuse
[2385.119s] for them for it to trade down for a
[2386.52s] little bit knock out the weak sisters
[2388.04s] one more time just punish them again and
[2390.28s] then straight up to much much higher
[2392.56s] level so excited for that year on-year
[2394.88s] growth in the S&amp;P cash use so you can
[2398.119s] see here a massive
[2400.359s] decline in BuyBacks relative to capex uh
[2404.92s] this is going to hurt EPS on the mag 7
[2407.48s] because that&#39;s where all the capex is
[2409.04s] bottom up consensus expects narrow mag 7
[2412.04s] versus uh 493 earnings growth Gap so we
[2416.28s] covered this already you can see it was
[2418.839s] 33% last year mag 7 outperformed in
[2421.599s] terms of earnings growth to the 493 and
[2423.96s] that starts to narrow the problem is is
[2425.52s] the multiple hasn&#39;t narrowed mag 7 33
[2427.8s] times maybe a little less now xmag 7
[2431.0s] call it 18 19 times uh and a lot of them
[2434.64s] a lot lower and uh accelerating uh
[2437.96s] closing in earnings growth moving
[2443.8s] along PE evaluations relative to history
[2447.96s] so you can see kind of
[2450.72s] where there&#39;s the greater
[2453.88s] growth
[2455.599s] um a greater opportunity in terms of the
[2459.52s] spread uh and then the absolute so the
[2462.16s] relative multiple and then the absolute
[2463.92s] multiple the absolute multiple they&#39;re
[2465.68s] basically saying real estate and energy
[2468.079s] are the only Bargains the relative
[2469.48s] multiple Staples I see a lot of
[2470.839s] opportunity there which is why I talked
[2472.24s] to to Kristen about a Staples name uh
[2476.599s] materials same
[2478.16s] story uh healthc care all the things
[2480.72s] that we&#39;ve been preaching about uh if
[2484.0s] you believe in value for money here&#39;s
[2486.079s] msci China around 10 10 times multiple
[2489.4s] down from 20 times at its peak and here
[2493.24s] is uh S&amp;P
[2495.64s] 500 uh trading at you know looks like
[2498.319s] about 24 25 on the basis of this
[2500.72s] Bloomberg chart China&#39;s Tech firm stage
[2503.319s] a rebound this year that actually broke
[2504.96s] out to new highs
[2506.359s] overnight uh here&#39;s from Ryan Dietrich
[2511.0s] uh again if stocks break the December
[2512.68s] low it&#39;s a warning side like 2025 did so
[2515.599s] what he&#39;s saying is the average return
[2517.24s] in years that they broke which we did
[2519.04s] because of the mag
[2520.24s] 7 um uh average return is flat to
[2523.839s] negative so negative 20 basis points uh
[2528.72s] I could see that I could see mag 7 being
[2531.079s] negative bringing the indices to flat
[2532.88s] and and some of the other names being up
[2534.88s] 50 100
[2536.119s] 150% uh that are beach balls underwater
[2538.839s] I mean you know Baba&#39;s already up what
[2541.28s] 50% in the last couple of months
[2543.599s] so uh healthc care single stock flows
[2546.72s] flip positive we talked about that last
[2548.96s] Shelby first same with materials
[2550.72s] flipping positive uh value ETFs
[2553.4s] outpacing growth ETFs everything we set
[2555.48s] you up with before the end of the year
[2557.92s] and told you we were going to do is now
[2559.68s] happening this actually broke Above This
[2561.72s] level meaningfully last night um and I
[2564.72s] think it&#39;s still holding there by the
[2566.24s] way uh but I would love to see after
[2569.2s] earnings just grind for a couple of
[2571.48s] months in here and really just take any
[2574.64s] possible believer all these weak sisters
[2576.76s] that just bought up here overnight 10
[2578.839s] points I mean 10-point move overnight I
[2580.92s] was at the airport just laughing I was
[2582.48s] like these guys are going to get slacked
[2584.559s] and um so there you go Chinese
[2588.0s] cloud-based lag us peers in
[2592.4s] growth um so you can see Alibaba Cloud
[2595.0s] intelligence growth ratio is growing
[2597.44s] basically the fastest Microsoft and
[2600.079s] Amazon have been flat their growth rate
[2602.559s] uh Buu has been going down Amazon is
[2605.88s] picking up share Alibaba excuse me
[2608.28s] Alibaba Cloud intelligence is picking up
[2610.48s] share in the Chinese Cloud business
[2613.0s] growth which is exciting to see and then
[2616.0s] uh and it&#39;s still early days they&#39;re
[2618.68s] five years behind us in terms of just
[2620.359s] basic digitization and compute uh core
[2623.48s] CPI auto insurance and shelter have
[2625.72s] contributed to the
[2627.68s] rise if you take that out which I don&#39;t
[2631.4s] know uh you get to 1.9% this is from Tom
[2634.599s] Le over at fund Strat is like yeah if
[2636.16s] you take everything out you get to zero
[2638.2s] but uh there you go CH US inflation rate
[2641.68s] but I like how he breaks that down very
[2643.559s] useful information all the time and um
[2646.559s] he again just a reminder for those of
[2648.16s] you who new literally there were like
[2650.599s] three four five people that were
[2652.72s] publicly bullish in the hole in October
[2655.119s] 2022 when everyone was selling in the
[2657.52s] hole the biggest billionaire hedge fund
[2659.559s] managers and I don&#39;t even need to say
[2661.119s] more than that for you to know who I&#39;m
[2662.359s] talking about we&#39;re we&#39;re telling people
[2664.24s] to sell when the market was down 27%
[2666.68s] unbel and we were on this every week
[2668.64s] telling people to buy um and I I&#39;m not
[2672.359s] saying that for a pat on the back cuz I
[2673.68s] I don&#39;t get everything right and you you
[2675.16s] know that I get some right I get some
[2676.68s] wrong but usually my wrong is just time
[2679.64s] it takes longer than expected and and
[2681.68s] sometimes it happens faster than
[2682.96s] expected uh and I&#39;m wrong on that front
[2685.0s] like I you know I have these new people
[2686.2s] that came in first quarter and they&#39;re
[2687.839s] smiling so wide they they can&#39;t believe
[2689.88s] I was like listen
[2691.52s] did this is yes we said this was
[2694.24s] probably going to happen but you know
[2697.04s] don&#39;t expect this all the time I mean
[2699.2s] it&#39;s not going to happen you&#39;re not
[2700.68s] going to have you know months like this
[2702.319s] uh uh all the time but the key is
[2705.28s] knowing the underlying business and uh
[2708.96s] and the businesses that you own and
[2710.319s] that&#39;s why great things happen and for
[2712.76s] out performance anyone who gets linear
[2715.119s] returns can outperform it&#39;s lumpy and
[2717.16s] when it happens it happens all at once
[2719.559s] you can get three four years of returns
[2721.76s] in a good year uh and and some cases a
[2724.68s] lot more than that um and then the other
[2727.28s] years you&#39;re moping along and then boom
[2729.28s] you just get crushing crushing
[2732.28s] unbelievably uh outperformance and that
[2734.76s] gives your irr great things over the
[2736.68s] three and fiveyear windows which is what
[2738.559s] everyone really cares about so um so
[2741.96s] we&#39;re we&#39;re there now so that&#39;s what&#39;s
[2743.359s] happening and people are surprised and
[2744.92s] I&#39;m not because I&#39;ve been on here every
[2746.52s] week with you saying this is going to
[2747.88s] happen and this is what happens and um
[2751.359s] and that&#39;s that
[2752.88s] so uh core inflation we saw the
[2755.16s] inflation numbers again we talked about
[2757.24s] you know Doge there are other factors
[2759.88s] seasonal factors and uh policy factors
[2762.52s] that are going to offset that European
[2764.559s] stocks see best start to year since 2000
[2767.44s] what was our key theme International
[2768.92s] outperforms domestic and that&#39;s and what
[2771.0s] what was the year that we kept pointing
[2772.16s] to 2 2001 2001 and here we go uh Europe
[2777.72s] trades at a record discount to the US
[2779.96s] Okay so we&#39;ve got our gxo which you know
[2782.0s] is a a show after hours Let&#39;s just
[2784.319s] call it what it was uh you got three
[2786.64s] problems s there uh number one uh you
[2789.76s] got to get the CMA announcement to clear
[2791.8s] it I&#39;ve never seen a regulator try to
[2793.92s] regulate a deal after the deal had
[2795.48s] closed I mean you can&#39;t even make this
[2797.4s] stuff up a bunch of socialists over in
[2799.0s] Europe but nonetheless uh we&#39;ll get an
[2802.04s] announcement on that in the next week
[2803.72s] they said on the earnings call so we&#39;ll
[2806.52s] see what happens um and then you got
[2809.559s] you&#39;re going to need the new CEO
[2811.2s] announcement is going to be another
[2813.079s] Catalyst and then from there look the
[2815.0s] business is doing well they had a couple
[2816.599s] C take down space but then open up space
[2820.04s] elsewhere um I like it it&#39;s absolutely
[2822.72s] fine we didn&#39;t do anything today we&#39;re
[2824.599s] going to take a few days let it settle
[2826.2s] out see where it is we added a ton at 42
[2828.319s] when it dropped after the deal was
[2830.04s] called off um uh and we&#39;ll make a
[2833.28s] determination if we&#39;re going to add more
[2834.52s] in the next few days we don&#39;t need jerk
[2836.04s] to anything we we&#39;re not that&#39;s not our
[2838.72s] that&#39;s not our thing I I&#39;d rather buy it
[2840.359s] up at 45 next week after the CMA blesses
[2843.72s] the deal uh then you know uh in the
[2847.68s] pocket because at the end of the day we
[2848.96s] got into this thing to be 80 100 100
[2851.559s] plus over the next handful of years so
[2853.559s] we&#39;re not it&#39; be nice to buy some at 30
[2856.52s] 35 but um we&#39;re going to take our time
[2860.119s] and and see uh the next few days how it
[2862.48s] settles out and um go through this stuff
[2865.359s] with the fine tooth colb because there
[2866.96s] are enough catalysts in the pipe and uh
[2869.44s] we want those to be positive catalyst so
[2871.64s] bank balance sheet holds the largest
[2873.359s] quantity of commercial mortgages set to
[2875.44s] mature in 2025 so this is going down
[2878.16s] everyone was worried about the
[2879.119s] refinancing wall it&#39;s getting better
[2882.359s] bottom up consensus we got
[2884.839s] that we got that hedge fund out clows in
[2888.72s] the past eight weeks they&#39;ve been
[2889.839s] selling in the Hole uh they&#39;ve been
[2892.28s] selling in the last eight weeks it&#39;s
[2894.319s] usually a contrarian indicator just like
[2896.2s] they were selling in the hole in
[2898.319s] 2022
[2900.0s] um but I do expect some choppiness over
[2902.599s] the next two weeks but then again
[2904.04s] everyone&#39;s expecting that so maybe I&#39;ll
[2905.4s] be wrong uh the good news is I&#39;m not
[2907.44s] going to make any buy or sell decisions
[2908.88s] on seasonal factors about what the
[2910.319s] general indices do I could care
[2912.16s] absolutely less that&#39;s why we run our
[2914.04s] book with very little leverage so we can
[2916.0s] just sit through the volatility and
[2918.2s] usually take advantage of that
[2919.559s] volatility to add to positions that we
[2921.319s] love like some of the ones that we&#39;ve
[2923.44s] mentioned Isaac Newton&#39;s nightmare South
[2926.119s] Sea stock December
[2929.88s] 1718 to September 21 this is a great uh
[2934.359s] I had lunch with my friend BV thank you
[2936.28s] so much
[2937.52s] uh in the city yesterday and uh his
[2939.92s] friend Paul and we were talking about
[2942.16s] some of the shiny object objects out
[2944.0s] there and things that are people are
[2945.319s] chasing and fomo jees and
[2948.92s] um the friend said something like you
[2951.119s] know
[2953.24s] they these people think they&#39;re smart I
[2956.079s] said you&#39;re missing this point the most
[2959.64s] brilliant people in the world have the
[2961.52s] same fomo gene as the poorest people in
[2963.4s] the world it&#39;s just a different mindset
[2965.0s] some of the greatest entrepreneurs
[2967.24s] that are on the for 400 act like retail
[2969.76s] Traders because it&#39;s not what they do
[2971.2s] what made them wealthy uh the ones that
[2973.24s] didn&#39;t do it through investing is
[2975.319s] Massive Action and add and and being
[2977.839s] non-stop active and interested and
[2980.359s] taking a lot of bets and a lot of shots
[2982.68s] on goal and if you do that in investing
[2984.799s] you just wipe out your account is
[2986.48s] basically what it comes down to but if
[2987.96s] you look at Isaac Newton uh one of the
[2990.04s] smartest people in the world during the
[2991.72s] south sea bubble he invested a little
[2993.599s] bit when it started to go up opinion
[2995.2s] follows Trend he exit he made a nice
[2998.04s] profit okay like uh uh everyone else and
[3001.839s] then started to go up against him all of
[3004.4s] his friends were getting rich so he you
[3007.76s] know said I did fine I did fine I&#39;m
[3009.72s] going to just it&#39;s fine but then it kept
[3011.839s] going up more and his friends kept
[3013.0s] getting richer so he put all in uh after
[3016.04s] it was up
[3017.0s] 8X uh and it went up a little bit more
[3019.44s] and he probably thought he was a genius
[3020.799s] went up another 15% uh and then it
[3023.2s] crashed all the way back down and he
[3024.44s] lost 90% of his money and died broke so
[3027.72s] um you have to know history Charles
[3032.2s] McCay
[3033.96s] uh Madness of crowds popular delusions
[3036.64s] and the magic uh and the uh popular
[3038.96s] delusions and The Madness of crowds that
[3040.799s] is you know I talk about intelligent
[3042.52s] investor that&#39;s a basic book you should
[3044.16s] read that for sure uh that&#39;s a that&#39;s a
[3047.16s] key
[3048.319s] one um so when you see these shiny
[3051.76s] objects going crazy and a lot of people
[3053.64s] recommending them after they&#39;re up huge
[3056.44s] uh just do your work just say would I
[3060.599s] would I take down this whole business at
[3062.68s] this price at the market is quoting
[3064.839s] today with my 100% of net worth so if
[3068.24s] you&#39;re going to buy uh a trading vehicle
[3071.96s] or an actual business that&#39;s trading at
[3074.799s] either valuations you can&#39;t justify uh
[3078.799s] or prices you wouldn&#39;t pay in the
[3080.16s] private Market just avoid it let them
[3081.96s] all get rich for a year or two and then
[3084.0s] in two years when they come ask you for
[3085.96s] a job because they lost all their money
[3088.319s] um just uh be humble and gentle because
[3092.92s] uh it&#39;s human nature is really what it
[3094.559s] comes down to don&#39;t don&#39;t say I told you
[3096.119s] so don&#39;t do any of that stuff um just
[3099.28s] understand it&#39;s the nature of the Beast
[3101.52s] uh gxo
[3103.2s] Logistics uh this came out after they
[3107.64s] reported and the stock went down they
[3110.799s] upheld their $63 price Target at Morgan
[3113.839s] Stanley they went through all the
[3115.319s] numbers uh
[3118.16s] um yeah and it&#39;ll work its way up there
[3120.799s] I mean should we have been in the market
[3122.04s] today I mean we we added a nice chunk at
[3124.799s] 42 we&#39;re going to see we it&#39;s not a
[3128.48s] position like Baba which is our largest
[3130.799s] position where we&#39;re just all in and we
[3132.839s] were buying like nobody&#39;s business we
[3135.079s] bought in the hundreds and we bought in
[3136.319s] the 60s so we have an 83 Blended basis
[3138.52s] across a little lower now across
[3140.92s] everything um gxo is not that level of
[3143.72s] conviction but I think gxo is going to
[3145.079s] be a nice beautiful double plus over
[3148.92s] time uh so but we don&#39;t want to get that
[3152.64s] percentage up too high it&#39;s not it&#39;s not
[3154.319s] our highest conviction idea like like a
[3156.2s] baba um but it&#39;s it&#39;s a good business
[3159.4s] and we want to see who the new CEO is
[3161.079s] that&#39;s that&#39;s a that&#39;s a key factor I
[3162.799s] think it&#39;s going to be a good one
[3163.64s] knowing Brad Jacobs he picks winners
[3166.96s] um okay here&#39;s from Elon Musk love them
[3170.359s] or or don&#39;t love him whatever you think
[3172.319s] it doesn&#39;t matter but what he says here
[3175.2s] and his stock market predictions haven&#39;t
[3176.72s] been that accurate in the past but I
[3178.64s] will say this uh this I think is 100%
[3182.04s] accurate and he says as it becomes clear
[3184.68s] that doge is working you will see the
[3186.96s] long-term treasury bill treasury note
[3190.68s] yields fall and all Americans will
[3193.72s] benefit from lower interest payments on
[3195.839s] mortgages small business debt credit
[3197.76s] card and other
[3199.04s] loans um my own addition tied to the
[3202.559s] longer end of the curve like mortgages
[3204.64s] Etc so you can see there
[3206.96s] it&#39;s a little higher than this now up
[3208.599s] about 50% in you know a month uh on Baba
[3212.839s] uh semiannual monetary policy report to
[3216.0s] Congress uh I would say we&#39;re close but
[3218.76s] not there on
[3220.799s] inflation same thing
[3223.24s] so that&#39;s that us profits are surprising
[3227.319s] by the most in a year we&#39;re going to
[3228.799s] talk about that earnings growth 16.4% in
[3232.119s] the quarter uh just over three months
[3234.04s] ago they were expecting 9% so that&#39;s a
[3236.16s] positive positive
[3239.04s] thing US
[3242.48s] Stocks uh this is at 75y year High
[3247.64s] versus the rest of the world going back
[3249.28s] to nifty50 going back to the internet
[3251.799s] bubble you can see all three standard
[3253.96s] deviations so you know these are the
[3255.92s] things you take the other side of and
[3257.24s] you make generational fortunes I&#39;m not
[3258.68s] saying short it I&#39;m saying avoid it and
[3262.119s] and and as that money comes out it&#39;s
[3263.88s] going to go into the safer uh more
[3266.48s] predictable durable things auto loan
[3268.96s] repayments as a share of after tax wages
[3271.24s] and salaries are at or below 2019 levels
[3273.839s] for Millennials and gen Z that&#39;s not the
[3276.079s] headline narrative that you see what
[3278.28s] else is happening we&#39;ve been talking
[3279.599s] about China ETF is outperforming the
[3282.359s] India ETF we said that J Japan and India
[3285.88s] were just hiding the Asian money that
[3287.72s] didn&#39;t want to be in China when they
[3289.0s] were locked into their apartments and
[3290.96s] sealed into their apartments by the
[3292.44s] government now that the doors have been
[3294.2s] broken open the money is going back to
[3295.92s] China opinion follows Trend India is now
[3298.599s] near a 52- we low on the IND ETF fxi is
[3305.119s] now up 50% year onye China versus US
[3309.28s] tech stocks this is going to converge I
[3311.799s] think it&#39;s going to be mostly catch up
[3313.559s] from China Tech versus a catch down from
[3315.839s] US tech but I think there will be some
[3317.359s] catch down for
[3318.799s] sure um uh these all sooner or L later
[3322.68s] always converge and then in periods like
[3324.799s] 2021 you get China gets a little
[3326.92s] outperformance as well same in 2008 and
[3330.0s] that 2001 to 2007 uh plus period
[3334.68s] Etc here is high yield credit spreads
[3337.359s] this is what you want to watch every
[3338.44s] single day if you&#39;re a nervous Nelly if
[3340.64s] this starts to spike up then your fears
[3342.599s] are starting to be a little bit
[3344.359s] Justified uh but so far so
[3348.72s] good what do we have here earning
[3351.559s] surprise again well above the mean of
[3353.28s] 4.4% be we&#39;re at like 8% earning surpris
[3356.76s] this week so uh this quarter which is
[3359.079s] exciting we covered the composite mag 7
[3362.68s] volume warning starting off with an
[3364.4s] intriguing eye-catcher this chart shows
[3367.359s] the one-year rolling average trading
[3369.039s] volume in mag seven stocks the concern
[3371.28s] is that it seems to be doing a similar
[3372.76s] thing to what it did in late
[3374.76s] 2021 uh into pandemic stimulus frenzy
[3379.72s] Peak taken by itself you might dismiss
[3381.64s] it but there are a few other points to
[3383.319s] ponder this so you see the volumes are
[3385.88s] at the the lowest level right before the
[3388.88s] mag 7 peak in early 20 late 2021 early
[3393.28s] 2022 sentiment kind of similar too chart
[3395.76s] patterns kind of similar too doesn&#39;t
[3397.64s] mean it&#39;s going to repeat but if I you
[3399.92s] know gun to the Head I&#39;d say higher
[3404.28s] probability of a bit lower than higher
[3406.4s] is certainly in the near term uh and
[3408.559s] that&#39;s putting it as diplomatically as I
[3411.119s] can net 10year returns between nonm mag
[3415.119s] Mega cap and Mega cap
[3417.96s] stocks so you could see we&#39;re back to
[3420.44s] the level uh before we had the huge
[3423.2s] explosion of small caps from 2000 to
[3426.68s] 2008 uh massive outperformance and then
[3429.16s] prior to that this is all cyclical
[3430.92s] ladies and gentlemen from the Reagan Era
[3433.039s] 90 1980 to 1985 you saw the same
[3436.0s] fiveyear massive outperformance I think
[3438.319s] we&#39;re going to see something similar
[3440.039s] very
[3442.48s] shortly
[3444.0s] uh share of clients expecting the US to
[3446.599s] be the best performing Global Equity
[3448.24s] region at the Goldman Sachs Global
[3449.96s] strategy conference in January of each
[3451.64s] year the highest wasn&#39;t even close 58%
[3454.96s] of the room think that us is going to be
[3456.72s] the worst take the other us us is going
[3459.039s] to be the best take the other side of
[3460.72s] that that&#39;s from Goldman Sachs via Mike
[3463.2s] zardi um I mean you know even in the
[3466.68s] most bullish years you saw 24 to 32% of
[3469.92s] the room thought that us would be the
[3472.2s] outperformer so um it&#39;s just it&#39;s fun
[3476.359s] how opinion follows Trend small caps are
[3478.4s] trading at a 22% discount to large caps
[3480.88s] again you haven&#39;t seen that since 2001
[3482.76s] so I continue to reemphasize this
[3484.24s] because these points if you get them
[3485.92s] right and you execute properly uh and
[3488.72s] for clients I&#39;m executing on your behalf
[3491.72s] um you know these are the times where
[3495.319s] really special things can happen and um
[3498.799s] and you&#39;re getting a taste of that
[3500.16s] already and it hasn&#39;t even begun so fed
[3502.72s] share Powell says Central Bank doesn&#39;t
[3504.359s] need to be in a hurry to lower interest
[3505.68s] rates far
[3507.88s] covered that break even rate is up this
[3510.319s] is going to come down similar to the
[3512.799s] first quarter of last year it spikes
[3514.599s] first quarter of the year before it
[3515.92s] spikes and then it comes down for the
[3517.28s] rest of the
[3520.24s] year Alibaba dramatically outperforming
[3523.28s] if you remember uh over the months I
[3526.319s] said that when the H sang goes uh
[3529.119s] alibaba&#39;s going to at least double the
[3530.799s] performance of the hangsang that&#39;s
[3532.079s] already happening you can see here uh
[3534.88s] forget forget the hang it&#39;s already two
[3536.92s] and 3X outperforming but even the
[3538.96s] hangang tech it&#39;s 2X outperforming and
[3542.079s] uh beginning of great things to come
[3543.88s] after we just confuse people for the
[3545.68s] next two months is my guess I&#39;m
[3547.559s] perfectly happy with it continuing to go
[3549.24s] straight straight up parabolic but uh
[3551.64s] I&#39;ve also been around long enough
[3554.4s] to expect a
[3556.48s] consolidation uh Consumer Staples no one
[3558.92s] wanted them now they&#39;re starting to go
[3560.52s] so get some of the laggards uh this is
[3563.039s] very important and this is something
[3564.88s] that we&#39;re the only ones really talking
[3566.96s] about uh and have been continually
[3569.48s] talking about is to watch certainly high
[3571.92s] yield credit spreads but watch the jgbs
[3574.839s] because as those rates go up the carry
[3577.119s] trade is unwinding and all that free
[3579.16s] carry trade money was in mag 7 and it is
[3582.079s] just uh bleeding out and it&#39;s going to
[3585.119s] continue to bleed out as their inflation
[3586.92s] numbers stay up and as the bank of Japan
[3590.28s] hikes rates uh the carry trade will
[3592.359s] unwind which means the mag mag 7 is
[3594.44s] going to lose that marginal bid just
[3595.88s] like like Orange County real estate uh
[3598.28s] so uh that&#39;s that City economic surprise
[3601.839s] index um turning down a little bit so
[3605.359s] keep an eye on that doesn&#39;t you know it
[3607.92s] is what it is uh forward earnings are
[3610.4s] edging
[3614.88s] higher so there&#39;s a lot of stuff here
[3617.24s] and this is like 10% of what we look at
[3619.4s] to kind of draw our conclusions in terms
[3621.44s] of General framework and then we&#39;d like
[3623.68s] to look at individual businesses very
[3625.24s] comprehensively
[3627.4s] um businesses that we&#39;d be willing to
[3629.079s] put 100% of our net worth if JP Morgan
[3631.76s] was going to finance the rest uh for to
[3634.039s] Own 100% of the business in the private
[3635.64s] market and uh if you&#39;re telling me that
[3638.559s] you would buy some of these fomo stocks
[3641.039s] with 100% of your net worth trading at
[3643.16s] you
[3644.0s] know 50 time sales or whatever they&#39;re
[3646.88s] trading at um Good Luck you might be
[3649.799s] right maybe earnings will catch up but
[3651.88s] history has shown that that the odds are
[3654.68s] against you but not
[3656.599s] impossible um I prefer to to make bets
[3659.64s] that I can sleep soundly at night when
[3660.92s] the odds are with me and do it over some
[3663.599s] non-correlated bets so if one doesn&#39;t
[3665.599s] work because of what I don&#39;t know that I
[3667.16s] don&#39;t know the rest well more than make
[3668.92s] up for it and meet my irr targets uh
[3673.48s] nickel back cost of making American
[3675.76s] coins this is mindboggling cost 3.69
[3678.44s] cents to make a 1-cent penny
[3681.119s] 13.78 cents to make a 5-cent nickel and
[3684.16s] then only at the dime do you start to
[3686.48s] get uh a good spread but I don&#39;t see how
[3690.24s] this makes sense moving forward so we&#39;ll
[3691.96s] see what Trump has to do about that
[3694.039s] buyback and dividend yields you can see
[3696.52s] the buyback yield
[3698.4s] is uh it&#39;s interesting it&#39;s negative on
[3701.28s] the Emerging Markets I think this is
[3702.48s] going to flip now when you&#39;re seeing
[3703.88s] with the Chinese companies and uh start
[3706.799s] to really add an additional level of
[3710.119s] returns to Emerging Markets bottom up
[3712.68s] consensus expect an hour we covered that
[3716.44s] okay non-farm payrolls that was Friday
[3718.68s] consumer credit people are worried about
[3720.4s] consumer credit people borrowing a lot
[3722.079s] you you have to worry about this when it
[3724.359s] starts going down when it starts going
[3726.279s] down you&#39;re getting a recession uh when
[3728.2s] it&#39;s going up it&#39;s it&#39;s okay for now if
[3730.279s] it stays up in that neighborhood it
[3731.48s] should be fine china consumer inflation
[3733.68s] picks up as holiday boosts spending uh
[3737.079s] people have been saying China&#39;s in never
[3739.2s] ending deflation it will never get out
[3740.559s] of deflation it&#39;s just not showing up
[3742.64s] that way anymore which is good um
[3746.559s] Europe at a record discount to the US
[3748.279s] you can see the multiples here 22 versus
[3751.92s] uh 14 times versus emerging markets at
[3754.44s] 12 times you tell me China CPI you can
[3758.4s] see the data here core CPI that&#39;s sign
[3760.76s] of health and positivity the a aaii
[3764.48s] sentiment survey today 47% of retail
[3767.68s] investors got bearish which is kind of
[3770.24s] interesting that&#39;s usually not where you
[3772.279s] want to be a seller but we&#39;re looking at
[3774.079s] this next two weeks of seasonal weakness
[3777.16s] uh that a lot of people are looking for
[3778.4s] weakness and usually when everyone&#39;s
[3779.72s] looking for the same thing maybe it
[3781.24s] doesn&#39;t happen but uh it&#39;s interesting
[3783.44s] to see so much bearishness all of the
[3785.119s] sudden from retail
[3787.64s] investors
[3789.599s] H just note it it&#39;s just another data
[3792.119s] point none of these are foolproof data
[3793.839s] points but in aggregate so this was kind
[3795.92s] of the big thing with gxo the guidance
[3797.76s] was only 240 to 260 in terms of uh
[3801.599s] earnings per share for next year which
[3803.359s] was a little lighter than 280 uh organic
[3806.599s] Revenue growth is going to be fine we&#39;ll
[3809.079s] do this one in detail next week uh we
[3811.279s] want to spend some more time on it on
[3814.68s] balance it was fine I&#39;d like to see more
[3817.559s] free cash flow but they&#39;re you know
[3819.559s] largely free cash flow positive 250
[3821.68s] million of free cash flow so they have
[3822.799s] all the runway to turn it around it&#39;s a
[3824.64s] duopoly it&#39;s a European exposed business
[3827.359s] which is what I want right now it meets
[3829.119s] all the things you got Brad Jacobs as
[3830.76s] chairman he&#39;ll figure it out he&#39;s got a
[3832.24s] lot on his plate these days um and uh so
[3836.44s] we&#39;ll just hold it and that that&#39;s that
[3838.0s] if it underperforms for 6 months so be
[3839.76s] it when it catches up it&#39;ll be a double
[3841.64s] or triple so uh we&#39;re okay with this but
[3844.76s] we want to see a couple of these
[3845.76s] Catalyst the CEO and the CMA get ironed
[3848.52s] out in the coming weeks and months uh
[3851.64s] equal weight versus aggregate S&amp;P 500
[3855.119s] annualized 10year returns from 1970 to
[3857.72s] 2024 another way to look at it equal
[3860.559s] weight has beat cap weighted index 78%
[3864.359s] of the 10-year periods so what we&#39;re in
[3866.72s] right now because of Zer is the
[3868.16s] exception not the rule continue to bet
[3870.44s] on the exception and face the
[3873.44s] consequences uh here&#39;s the capb backs
[3875.52s] that&#39;s that people are thinking that&#39;s a
[3877.079s] great thing that&#39;s a margin eroder and a
[3879.2s] buyback
[3881.039s] murderer there will be much less
[3883.2s] BuyBacks with this amount of defensive
[3884.92s] cap backs share of sales derived from
[3887.039s] outside the US uh that&#39;s mag seven so
[3889.92s] they&#39;re going to get hit this first
[3891.0s] quarter because the dollar has been
[3892.319s] strong they&#39;ll catch a Tailwind in the
[3893.839s] second half when the dollar comes down
[3895.319s] but now they&#39;re going to get hit the
[3897.0s] most because they have the most sales
[3898.279s] outside the US so you&#39;ll see that in Q2
[3901.119s] earning q1 earnings reported during Q2
[3904.72s] uh here&#39;s the flow of funds tends to
[3906.039s] Peak right around now and then that&#39;s
[3907.64s] why you get a week second half we&#39;ll see
[3909.119s] if that&#39;s the case this year second half
[3911.039s] of
[3912.799s] February
[3914.359s] um Q4 earnings growth is actually more
[3917.319s] than 16.4 uh Goldman Sachs say 17.1 so a
[3921.44s] lot of good things happening here and uh
[3924.839s] you can see where a lot of the growth is
[3926.76s] coming materials is still a quarter away
[3928.48s] from really turning the corner but um
[3931.68s] healthc care is starting to come up uh
[3935.2s] financials consumer
[3937.359s] discretionary Technology&#39;s come down
[3939.319s] from last year quite a bit from you know
[3942.52s] uh cyclicals so cyclicals that&#39;s pretty
[3945.319s] impressive 17.6% earnings growth for Q4
[3949.119s] uh
[3950.799s] okay again fxi versus IND Dy China
[3954.559s] versus India ratio chart starting to
[3956.76s] break out from uh Allstar
[3960.119s] charts and that&#39;s that for the data so
[3962.559s] you can see it&#39;s emphasizing a lot of
[3964.64s] the same points but as you see them
[3966.319s] playing out when we were kind of the
[3969.119s] only ones talking about them months ago
[3972.119s] um you can see why it makes sense to pay
[3975.4s] attention to these longer term patterns
[3977.039s] over time here&#39;s
[3978.52s] CPS
[3980.44s] um so the thing that is the stock will
[3983.92s] probably sell off tomorrow I thought I
[3986.119s] was amazed by the free cash flow uh in
[3989.48s] the quarter so they did 63.2 million I
[3993.2s] thought they&#39;d be cash flow positive but
[3994.44s] I didn&#39;t think it would be this cash
[3996.0s] flow positive cash provided by
[3997.44s] operations 74 million uh that&#39;s just
[4000.119s] absolutely
[4001.24s] amazing um but it&#39;s you know it&#39;s Q4 and
[4004.72s] that includes the impact of some of the
[4006.92s] discontinued uh divisions so on balance
[4010.839s] uh this was a good report where the the
[4013.96s] problem is going to be
[4016.079s] is that uh while they&#39;re guiding $0 to
[4019.279s] $235 million of adjusted
[4022.4s] eida um
[4025.039s] their North
[4027.119s] American light vehicle production
[4029.96s] assumptions are very low so remember we
[4032.78s] [Music]
[4034.72s] need everything above
[4038.039s] 15.7 uh is where we start to just mint
[4040.559s] money where all the fixed costs are paid
[4042.559s] and like every 200,000 300,000 cars is
[4045.16s] $3 a share of earnings up to $3 a share
[4047.799s] of earnings if they don&#39;t add cost back
[4049.279s] which they say they don&#39;t have to uh
[4051.119s] they&#39;ll have to add some but let&#39;s just
[4052.359s] say it&#39;s $2 a share in earnings you get
[4054.52s] back to a normal peak level of 17.1
[4057.279s] million uh
[4059.279s] cars couple years out you&#39;re looking at
[4061.96s] $10 plus per year in earnings why does
[4065.16s] that matter is because the last peak in
[4067.48s] 2017 was $719 in earnings and the stock
[4070.48s] traded up to 146 so um I think you have
[4074.599s] a couple of things going number
[4076.72s] one the oem&#39;s margins are going to get
[4079.64s] smoked because of tariffs and nonsense
[4082.48s] going on and they overcharged during
[4084.4s] covid Etc uh so they have to be humble
[4088.0s] about their guidance because they&#39;re
[4089.24s] going to be going into negotiations on
[4091.16s] price um and that&#39;s number one and
[4094.559s] number two I think we&#39;re going to find
[4097.04s] that these numbers these industry
[4099.719s] assumptions which they have no control
[4101.159s] over the things that they do have
[4102.239s] control over they&#39;re doing well things
[4103.96s] they don&#39;t have control over
[4108.359s] um you know if that&#39;s true 15.1 it&#39;s
[4112.719s] going to be probably a cash flow Break
[4114.159s] Even or slight slightly positive year if
[4116.159s] it comes in at 16 because what&#39;s
[4119.319s] happening is we&#39;re going to do a lot
[4122.04s] more volume from a lot more incentives
[4123.679s] at a lot lower margins for the
[4126.0s] oems um and that&#39;s the trend for younger
[4129.96s] people buying cars they&#39;re buying
[4131.159s] smaller and they&#39;re buying cheaper uh
[4133.56s] and then maybe you get a Tailwind on on
[4135.679s] uh car loan rates Etc we don&#39;t know but
[4138.52s] smaller same with the houses you could
[4140.6s] wind up doing 16 and then this thing
[4142.52s] just Banks coin and it&#39;s it&#39;s Off to the
[4145.279s] Races and uh the other things so this is
[4148.08s] one that we will definitely look at uh
[4151.159s] in the next week we&#39;ll see what they
[4152.48s] have to say on the call tomorrow but
[4154.4s] this the the part about their
[4156.96s] guidance that is not
[4160.0s] ideal is their industry assumptions
[4163.359s] about how many cars the oems are going
[4165.08s] to produce but those are always
[4167.56s] conservative uh and I think that&#39;s going
[4169.92s] to be proven to be incorrect as uh
[4173.12s] inventories have to go up as incentives
[4175.0s] go up and as size of the car goes down
[4177.48s] which hurts the oems because it hurts
[4179.279s] their margins but it helps the arms
[4181.199s] dealers which is the auto part suppliers
[4183.359s] that have to supply more and more units
[4185.759s] uh to support the
[4188.44s] oems value stocks are out earning
[4190.679s] forecast there you go consumer borrowing
[4193.0s] surges to 40 we covered that Japan&#39;s
[4194.96s] households spending massively beats
[4196.679s] expectations boosting the case for
[4198.0s] further boj hikes which does what

[4205.88s] leaving Bank of Japan&#39;s fresh take on
[4207.719s] labor crunch opens door for more rate

[4212.36s] 14-year High billionaire David terer
[4215.48s] built on his everything China bet as
[4218.12s] rally faded uh he&#39;s now got 37% of his
[4221.76s] portfolio in China we thought we were
[4224.56s] overweight which we are uh but he&#39;s gone
[4228.159s] uh uh cowboy on that so good for him uh
[4232.44s] The Magnificent Seven companies just did
[4234.52s] something that haven&#39;t I mean notionally
[4236.32s] with our option exposure we probably
[4238.04s] have way more exposure on a relative
[4239.679s] basis than he has but we we have uh
[4242.76s] dramatically less downside than he does
[4244.679s] so that&#39;s that&#39;s another interesting
[4246.6s] thing which is huge the way we structure
[4249.12s] for clients some of the long dated out
[4251.64s] of the money spreads uh that we made so
[4254.28s] much money on in October and we&#39;re going
[4256.12s] to do again in
[4257.8s] 2025 um kind of you know as as heavy
[4261.28s] weight as we are in stock which is nice
[4263.12s] for the portfolio the real juice and
[4265.36s] Alpha comes from our special sauce in
[4267.48s] that regard and um uh our notional like
[4272.239s] if you added up the amount of stock it
[4275.719s] represents it&#39;s it&#39;s uh it&#39;s super
[4278.32s] exciting and then our downside relative
[4280.28s] to that risk is so low uh and and
[4283.32s] Quantified which is super asymmetry is

[4322.12s] out they figure out what the customer
[4323.56s] wants and then they just jam it through
[4324.88s] the pipes and uh they figure it out so
[4327.44s] you if you buy them and when they&#39;re out
[4329.52s] of favor and you got to wait a year or

[4365.719s] partnership with Alibaba excites Chinese
[4369.04s] iOS developers ahead of conference uh
[4371.96s] that was the big news this week
[4373.08s] obviously is that apple is going to use
[4376.04s] alibaba&#39;s uh AI across all their devices
[4378.84s] in China that&#39;s huge because now it
[4380.639s] becomes the gold standard over there and
[4382.04s] everything else falls to the Wayside uh
[4384.44s] with deep seek China moves to take on
[4386.6s] nvidia&#39;s Cuda ecosystem so you know
[4389.8s] Nvidia tried to do what Apple did we
[4391.88s] talked about this and we said the
[4393.76s] government&#39;s not going to let them build
[4395.28s] the wal Garden that they let happen with
[4398.28s] the Apple App Store under their nose
[4400.4s] that&#39;s not going to happen well now the
[4402.08s] private Market is taking that and um
[4406.239s] uh used to be you could you know you
[4408.08s] really needed to use Nvidia software to
[4411.239s] develop these models uh deep seek turned
[4414.36s] that on its head so did Alibaba Quinn uh
[4417.6s] Etc so Wall Street U UBS to see upside
[4420.639s] for Chinese AI stocks with rally at less
[4423.239s] than halfway mark I mean these are the
[4425.159s] same people who were negative in the
[4426.4s] whole now they say it&#39;s going to double
[4428.4s] again uh I think they&#39;re being
[4430.239s] conservative Japan soft Bank swings to a
[4432.32s] loss ahead of big AI infrastructure bet
[4434.44s] on Stargate project you know here&#39;s the
[4436.239s] cowboy coming in saying I got $200
[4438.159s] billion and you know this is a guy who
[4440.76s] blew up shareholders with we we we work
[4444.679s] uh and uh sold Alibaba in the hole at70
[4448.04s] $60 we probably bought a lot of his
[4449.96s] shares uh and now uh says uh he&#39;s going
[4453.159s] to give $200 billion for this and you
[4455.4s] know he has a a $2.4 billion loss in the
[4458.12s] in the quarter uh he&#39;ll figure it out
[4460.28s] because he&#39;s like a cat with n Nine
[4461.76s] Lives some people just have that luck
[4463.36s] but um good luck I wouldn&#39;t bet on it at
[4466.44s] some point these guys hit a wall Alibaba
[4468.6s] shares surged to the highest since 2022
[4471.199s] on AI rally Alibaba pairs with apple to
[4474.639s] develop AI
[4476.12s] features okay billionaire David terer
[4479.0s] boosts China Stak to 37% our notional is
[4482.48s] way higher than that but our actual real
[4484.719s] money is way lower which I which I love
[4486.76s] the asymmetry because uh we can get many
[4489.56s] multiples of The Upside with a third of
[4491.92s] the risk uh is Intel now a trump stock
[4495.28s] its shares surge after upbeat comments
[4497.44s] by JD Vance this was yesterday and then
[4499.76s] they followed through today stocks up to
[4502.08s] 2425 just getting started in r view

[4513.6s] we were pounding the table on the
[4515.12s] podcast to buy Disney in the 80s and
[4517.8s] 90s uh everyone would I would get all
[4520.4s] these texts and emails and nonsense
[4523.08s] saying you know go woke go broke
[4525.92s] and uh I don&#39;t I never invest on the
[4528.04s] basis of politics one way or another I
[4530.679s] invest on the basis of cash generation
[4532.48s] and there&#39;s some of that that probably
[4533.719s] hurt them and and hurt sentiment and
[4535.28s] everything else but that&#39;s uh those days
[4537.239s] are in the rearview mirror for those who
[4539.36s] act who you know uh think that&#39;s
[4541.56s] important to investing uh There You Go
[4543.96s] China land sales show property Market
[4546.32s] stabilizing Chinese Tech stock slide as
[4549.36s] strong rally Spurs profit taking so this
[4551.96s] is what you see on a day-to-day they&#39;re
[4553.28s] all waiting for this so when it pulls
[4555.159s] back to
[4557.4s] 103 or 11
[4559.679s] 110 uh I can&#39;t wait to see the headlines
[4562.44s] from Bloomberg and from my favorite lady
[4565.6s] over at Barons who&#39;s been awfully quiet
[4568.8s] during this 50% rally in Alibaba so she
[4571.48s] was super
[4572.88s] negative every day for two years under a
[4577.32s] hundred bucks and now that the Stock&#39;s
[4579.639s] up 50% uh she&#39;s nowhere to be heard and
[4582.56s] uh they have uh new right ERS talking
[4585.8s] about it but when it pulls back to 112
[4587.28s] she&#39;ll be back and she&#39;ll be saying see
[4589.56s] another fake out blah blah blah and
[4591.56s] there&#39;s your contrarian indicator Intel
[4593.76s] stock is on a run not seen in more than
[4595.56s] two decades uh three-day rally fueled by
[4598.56s] hospitable political climate and analyst
[4600.88s] commentary about its CPU business I said
[4604.239s] this a couple weeks ago when deep seek
[4606.84s] was out deep seek could generate similar
[4609.44s] type of performance with inferior chips
[4611.8s] and I said who is the king of inferior
[4614.36s] chips in the world the king of inferior
[4616.8s] chips is Intel and it&#39;s priced like it
[4619.639s] doesn&#39;t even have chips so uh here&#39;s
[4622.4s] what you&#39;re seeing again opinion follows
[4624.4s] friend and here&#39;s jeffy&#39;s analyst Blain
[4627.44s] Curtis getting bullish after it&#39;s had a
[4630.04s] 25% move uh power moves and power tools
[4633.239s] stock market and sentiment results we
[4635.199s] simply covered uh in detail the Alibaba
[4638.84s] news I would read this article by the
[4641.48s] way um
[4645.92s] showing the double out performance of
[4647.6s] Alibaba relative to the index and then
[4649.84s] talking about all the analysts getting
[4651.6s] excited and the reasons why they&#39;re
[4653.679s] super excited right now whether it&#39;s the
[4656.12s] cloud growth whether it&#39;s the AI
[4658.36s] partnership and now they&#39;re paying
[4660.679s] attention to it being undervalued still
[4662.96s] trading at only 12.2 times forward
[4665.6s] earnings uh no not 12.2 times sales 12.2
[4669.92s] times forward earnings ladies and
[4671.4s] gentlemen uh and uh and maybe maybe
[4674.12s] we&#39;ll get uh they&#39;ll take guidance down
[4676.719s] to half a penny and that&#39;ll get the
[4678.4s] stock down to 110 uh and then the
[4680.639s] multiple will be down to 12 and people
[4682.239s] will say see and then at 200 they&#39;ll be
[4684.88s] buying it Handover fist just like Mr
[4687.36s] Isaac Newton with the south sea bubble
[4690.159s] uh selling at the wrong time and buying
[4691.84s] at the wrong time not because he was
[4693.159s] dumb he was one of the it&#39;s not the
[4695.32s] smartest people person in the world at
[4697.0s] the time but because it&#39;s a different
[4698.8s] skill set and um uh that&#39;s all I can say
[4704.28s] um
[4706.52s] there&#39;s gener same thing you can see
[4708.639s] free cash flow recovery stock you know
[4711.6s] under 100 no one wanted it we were table
[4713.76s] Pounders at 200 or 190 everyone wanted
[4716.96s] it now it fell back down to 150 no one
[4719.159s] wants it bottom line is the cash flow is
[4721.08s] recovering to record highs and it just
[4722.8s] printed record high free cash flow
[4724.96s] penetration rate is low um disruptions
[4728.239s] from weather and demand on the grid are
[4730.48s] going up not down and rates will slowly
[4733.48s] come down and and new houses will slowly
[4735.6s] go up uh and this will be a monster
[4738.52s] beneficiary the big two by the way the
[4741.639s] title of this and and Jeff did an
[4743.639s] incredible job uh should have been
[4748.28s] um two best levered plays on housing
[4753.0s] recovery I was looking at some home
[4754.96s] builders today and they&#39;re down a lot
[4757.239s] but they they&#39;ve been up a lot so I I
[4759.159s] wouldn&#39;t I wouldn&#39;t really get excited
[4760.76s] about buying home builders in the hole
[4762.6s] yet I think they probably have some more
[4763.8s] pain and as the numbers start to improve
[4765.6s] I think the price is still going to go
[4766.76s] lower for for the home builders just
[4768.679s] like you saw with Alibaba uh but I think
[4771.04s] these are the two best ways to play a
[4773.159s] housing recovery massive units smaller
[4775.36s] size units smaller footprint uh is going
[4778.04s] to be Stanley Black and&amp; Decker and
[4779.52s] gener I I think are going to be huge so
[4781.48s] you can read all the reasons why here
[4783.92s] and then you could also read same thing
[4785.48s] with Stanley Black and&amp; Decker destock
[4787.36s] to restock uh just waiting for the
[4789.76s] housing units and this will be Off to
[4791.239s] the Races construction Etc but free cash
[4793.679s] flow you&#39;ve got Runway this is all you
[4795.6s] need all you need is Runway price is
[4797.719s] going to be priced it&#39;s going to hover
[4799.08s] around between 80 and 110 and then the
[4802.199s] game is going to be on and the thing&#39;s
[4803.679s] going to go straight back to New highs
[4805.239s] and it&#39;s going to take a few years and
[4807.04s] your irr is going to be you know 30 31%
[4810.36s] on the investment and it all came in the
[4812.159s] last six months uh and people be like oh
[4814.76s] yeah that that happened
[4817.159s] um uh actually you know it&#39;s funny I
[4820.8s] only hear things before they work after
[4823.4s] they work it&#39;s crickets it&#39;s
[4824.719s] unbelievable when uh Alibaba was down
[4828.08s] and I&#39;d post something about Alibaba I&#39;d
[4829.679s] get like 400 you know likes and now that
[4833.679s] it&#39;s like gone up 50% everyone&#39;s
[4835.84s] crickets why because they sold in the
[4837.48s] hole they got tired of it they got
[4838.639s] pushed out of it at the exact wrong time
[4840.76s] they couldn&#39;t hold on and now they hate
[4842.52s] that it&#39;s up so big so you know maybe
[4844.8s] they&#39;ll buy some at 110 or whatever when
[4846.52s] they could have bought at 70 but that is
[4848.239s] human
[4849.04s] nature um except for the people
[4851.48s] listening to this podcast uh who are
[4854.719s] awesome and uh are learning some of
[4856.48s] these tricks of the trade and doing
[4858.56s] great and I also hear great things from
[4860.4s] them as well so uh so here&#39;s the
[4864.8s] existing home sales this is a great
[4866.4s] chart that Jeff included and it just
[4868.76s] shows we&#39;re kind of just getting started
[4870.4s] here for the next cycle houses are going
[4872.36s] to be smaller units are going to pick
[4873.719s] back up and gener and Stanley are going
[4876.32s] to be huge massive levered plays and
[4878.639s] they have all the runway so if it takes
[4880.639s] if it starts right away if it takes a
[4882.159s] year if it takes two years as long as
[4883.44s] you have free cash flow on the Bal she
[4884.76s] it&#39;s okay you just waited out and when
[4886.48s] it happens it happens all at once he did
[4888.08s] a chart on eida uh we don&#39;t talk about
[4891.719s] eida on this conference call so uh let&#39;s
[4894.199s] ni that moving forward but uh uh the
[4896.84s] concept is the same uh with free cash
[4899.04s] flow you&#39;re seeing the recovery and I
[4900.4s] like the
[4901.639s] theme
[4904.159s] uh Intel so he covered that you can see
[4907.12s] the price down because the business is
[4908.44s] down again next Catalyst for them just
[4910.679s] like gxo new CEO we got a little bit of
[4913.92s] policy tail wi maybe we&#39;ll get a little
[4915.52s] policy Tailwind on
[4917.08s] gxo as far as Cooper standard uh I like
[4920.36s] buying on the weakness here because I
[4921.6s] think the industry numbers are too low
[4923.48s] and I think management is also going to
[4925.48s] be conservative or negative on the call
[4928.0s] tomorrow because the oem&#39;s quarters were
[4930.44s] crap in terms of profitability great in
[4932.44s] terms of units uh so they don&#39;t want to
[4934.719s] say hey we&#39;re making all this money
[4936.199s] while you know GM and Ford and uh Stanis
[4939.719s] are cutting costs and laying off people
[4941.36s] because they paid too much to the union
[4943.48s] so um so that&#39;s that that&#39;ll create
[4945.96s] another opportunity particularly for new
[4947.32s] people to finally get a realsize
[4949.28s] position uh will be great you know many
[4952.48s] of you listening to this have Bas SE in
[4954.84s] the $5 when we started buying in March
[4957.32s] of 2022 and um and eight and eight and
[4961.04s] $9 across everything uh so hopefully we
[4964.199s] can get a bunch at you know 12 or 11 or
[4966.719s] 13 it&#39;s going to depend on tomorrow&#39;s
[4968.199s] call and liquidity but it&#39;s all noise
[4971.36s] this cycle repeats itself every 5 to 7
[4974.719s] years and we&#39;ll get the ussar and they
[4977.44s] will mint money uh Vance also mentioned
[4980.639s] other touchstones of the Trump
[4981.96s] Administration saying that quote to
[4983.36s] safeguard America&#39;s Advantage it will
[4985.239s] ensure that the most powerful AI systems
[4987.0s] are built in the US with American
[4989.04s] designed and manufactured chips well the
[4991.28s] only player in town yeah they can bring
[4993.04s] tsmc over here and they will but the
[4995.08s] only player in town is Intel and they
[4996.96s] got to make Intel work uh and that&#39;s how
[4999.36s] it&#39;s going to be maybe they&#39;ll put 50%
[5001.199s] of the equity in The Sovereign wealth
[5002.48s] fund but if they make this thing work
[5005.239s] it&#39;s going to have a US Monopoly is
[5006.719s] really what it&#39;s going to come down to
[5007.88s] because Trump&#39;s going to push them to do
[5009.36s] all their orders through Intel
[5010.6s] particularly if the Sovereign wealth
[5011.6s] fund and the taxpayers hold it I I don&#39;t
[5014.44s] I can&#39;t tell you whether this Sovereign
[5016.159s] wealth fund is going to happen or not it
[5017.96s] doesn&#39;t wreak of proper capitalism but
[5022.28s] uh I wouldn&#39;t be surprised so there you
[5024.36s] go and you can read through all this
[5025.56s] great detail uh that was highlighted for
[5028.12s] you again CNN fear and greed is is is
[5031.28s] fearful it&#39;s kind of neutral here uh not
[5034.679s] an area where I want to buy everything
[5035.96s] or sell everything to be honest with you
[5038.12s] I&#39;m just paying attention to the
[5040.04s] seasonality NASDAQ top 30 wor weights
[5042.96s] earnings estimates in the last 60
[5045.84s] days down 19 basis points so basically
[5049.76s] flat uh Dow same thing top 30 weights
[5054.4s] uh up for next year 55 bips down for
[5058.679s] this year 71 bip so again
[5060.96s] flattish uh here was was 16.4 that was
[5063.6s] last Friday said we&#39;re at 17.1 thing I
[5066.52s] want to keep an eye on is the seasonal
[5069.36s] the seasonal tendency is that guidance
[5071.159s] comes down in the first quarter every
[5073.639s] year and we are in fact seeing that you
[5076.239s] know down from we were basically at 275
[5078.36s] all year and we&#39;re now down to
[5081.0s] 272 interestingly enough uh 2024 is
[5085.679s] finishing up much better than I
[5086.84s] anticipated so don&#39;t be surprised by a
[5089.44s] hockey stick in the back half getting
[5091.04s] back up over 275 280
[5094.92s] that&#39;s earnings uh we talked the PPI was
[5098.28s] better than the CPI but again seasonally
[5100.48s] this has happened every January and some
[5102.639s] February is in the last few years so
[5104.119s] don&#39;t make too much of it yet
[5106.119s] particularly with all the people that
[5107.199s] are getting laid off with Doge and let&#39;s
[5110.76s] get down to the ask me anything
[5112.8s] questions for those of you who uh get
[5115.159s] value from the ask me anything questions
[5117.28s] stick around for those of you just like
[5118.88s] the podcast we kept it uh here to a
[5121.199s] reasonable amount of time we&#39;ll see you
[5123.08s] next week same time same place so
[5125.36s] question number one comes
[5131.239s] from uh JT investor he&#39;s asking about
[5134.6s] the guidance with CPS we covered that uh
[5137.639s] and that&#39;s just a function of the things
[5138.96s] that they don&#39;t control which is
[5140.04s] industry volumes which I think are way
[5141.639s] too low as they have been fa set says
[5145.199s] over the last five weeks that q1
[5146.96s] earnings and revenue are trending
[5150.08s] down uh da da da so that&#39;s normal
[5154.32s] guidance comes down the first quarter we
[5155.639s] covered that last
[5156.96s] week it seems gxo won&#39;t reach its 2027
[5162.159s] goals
[5163.679s] uh yeah they organic growth uh low
[5166.239s] single digit versus double digit does
[5168.04s] this change your view on the company no
[5169.639s] it just extends it so it&#39;s going to hurt
[5171.159s] my irr in the short term unless they get
[5173.719s] a great CEO and they get the CMA thing
[5176.92s] improved uh it&#39;s just going to take a
[5179.8s] little longer which will give me an
[5180.84s] opportunity to probably build the
[5182.239s] position a little bit more uh but we&#39;re
[5184.48s] not doing anything yet and haven&#39;t
[5185.8s] decided whether we are we&#39;re comfortable
[5187.4s] with our position uh as as it stands
[5190.04s] Henry bashari wanted to say thank you
[5192.48s] your framework has given me a guide on
[5193.719s] how to handle my emotions I used to
[5195.239s] panic I used to panic when positions
[5197.52s] fall but now I know that as long as I&#39;ve
[5199.199s] read through the noise and I know I what
[5201.239s] I need to do appreciate your teachings
[5202.679s] and wish you all the best in life thank
[5204.679s] you Henry that&#39;s very kind um Brian
[5209.0s] Norman uh are you backing up the truck
[5211.119s] on gxo no not yet I made it that may may
[5214.32s] change tomorrow but uh I&#39;m comfortable
[5216.32s] with the position and just because
[5218.159s] something happens to a stock you know
[5220.119s] most people the stock beats earnings and
[5222.28s] the stock goes up and everyone has to
[5223.56s] chase it up and some and sometimes it
[5226.0s] keeps continuing and sometimes it
[5227.92s] complete fake out and then Ju Just the
[5230.159s] Same it goes down usually you want to
[5232.32s] wait three days anyway number one to
[5235.119s] take some time and think about
[5237.04s] it um I mean if if they had the best
[5240.32s] quarter ever and it went to 50 would I
[5242.239s] would I be buying more and the answer is
[5243.56s] no so um because my basis is a lot lower
[5247.4s] so uh I&#39;m G to wait for it to settle out
[5250.0s] I&#39;m going to do some more work on it
[5251.04s] over the weekend uh and I&#39;m perfectly
[5253.96s] comfortable doing nothing and letting it
[5255.679s] go lower before it goes higher or
[5257.32s] letting it go higher and I missed the
[5259.0s] day to add a few shares it doesn&#39;t
[5260.92s] doesn&#39;t really make a difference to me
[5262.239s] it&#39;s not the highest conviction idea in
[5264.28s] the portfolio and um I mean if you saw
[5268.199s] how much I was buying in one day when
[5269.96s] Baba hit 58 that one day and the high
[5273.159s] 60s that would blow your mind all right
[5275.92s] here&#39;s a question from Warren Buffett uh
[5279.36s] you guys can verify if this is a correct
[5282.04s] uh uh authentic email address it says
[5284.4s] warren.
[5285.92s] buffett. 3@gmail.com
[5288.88s] hello Tom thank you for all the great
[5291.719s] time in your show even at my age I am
[5293.92s] still spying on your tips check this out
[5298.04s] uh for me my eyeballs are getting
[5302.119s] tired uh are Archer Daniel Midland and
[5306.04s] FMC
[5307.6s] corporation uh thanks Warren okay Warren
[5311.84s] let&#39;s see uh I&#39;m not the guy to be
[5313.92s] giving you advice but you could ask your
[5315.679s] son about Archer Daniel mid Archer
[5317.6s] Daniel&#39;s Midland because a he&#39;s a farmer
[5319.52s] and B I think he&#39;s still on the board uh
[5321.84s] We&#39;ve covered this one a lot I do like
[5323.52s] it uh I&#39;ve got it on alert if it gets
[5326.08s] down to 40 I&#39;ll probably start to buy it
[5328.239s] you say well what&#39;s the difference why
[5329.56s] not just start buying at 45 and the
[5331.159s] answer is we don&#39;t really have room for
[5332.28s] it right now and there&#39;s nothing I&#39;m
[5333.32s] willing to sell to make room for it uh
[5335.8s] but yeah I got my eye on it but let me
[5337.639s] just take a look at the financials cuz I
[5339.08s] think we did this one and I wasn&#39;t that
[5343.639s] excited yeah free cash flow had been
[5345.639s] going down revenues had been going down
[5346.88s] so I&#39;d have to listen to a bunch of
[5348.0s] calls uh and find out what the
[5350.08s] turnaround plan is but yeah you&#39;re
[5351.56s] seeing this across all the a space FMC
[5354.84s] this again this is why there&#39;s always
[5356.639s] something for us to do I know we&#39;ve been
[5358.76s] pounding the table about the window for
[5360.239s] the dstock restock cycle is closing and
[5362.199s] a lot of those names have run uh or are
[5365.119s] running um but there&#39;s always stuff to
[5367.159s] do FMC similar type of thing uh I like
[5370.6s] both of these but we&#39;re not buying them
[5372.92s] yet but we would uh definitely want to
[5374.92s] be doing work
[5376.56s] on um both of them for sure because when
[5380.44s] they turn they turn hard they&#39;re
[5381.92s] cyclical businesses they&#39;re not really
[5383.32s] own forever businesses but this one is
[5385.56s] turning around uh FMC we got to see a
[5388.239s] revenue start to turn around and
[5390.199s] understand why it got hit so bad but
[5392.0s] you&#39;re seeing it Company by company so
[5395.119s] uh yeah I definitely like this space uh
[5397.159s] thank you Warren for your great ideas
[5399.48s] and and by the way for changing my life
[5402.239s] uh even though you&#39;re not the real
[5403.28s] Warren Buffett uh Mitch
[5405.639s] Lim
[5407.88s] um is there an opinion on Twitter
[5411.08s] stating that the positive correlation
[5413.4s] between HSI and HSI volatility index
[5415.719s] means that us hedge funds are likely
[5417.48s] manipulating the market Mitch this is
[5420.52s] the biggest amount of bullshittery just
[5423.639s] for get it what does that have to do
[5426.199s] with the amount of cash that Alibaba is
[5428.199s] going to generate over the next 5 years
[5429.88s] being the leader in AI the leader in
[5432.44s] Cloud uh complete toll taker on the
[5435.0s] recovery of the middle class stop
[5437.239s] wasting your time reading that
[5439.52s] is completely useless to making money
[5441.719s] but thank you for the beautiful question
[5443.32s] because I&#39;m sure that helped a lot of
[5444.48s] people and thank you for being a great
[5446.8s] listener uh Chris
[5449.08s] Williamson uh take a look at ACH good
[5452.28s] medical device opportunity here
[5454.0s] inflecting on profitability could be a
[5456.199s] strong year for them let&#39;s take a
[5478.04s] look uh this thing has really negative
[5480.76s] free cash flow this is a no no for us
[5482.48s] because they don&#39;t have the runway so
[5484.32s] I&#39;m going to pass and I&#39;ll take a look
[5486.119s] if you want to ask again in a couple of
[5488.679s] you know next if they start to print
[5490.36s] some free cash flow then let me know uh
[5494.04s] actually let me take a look at the
[5494.96s] quarterly here even though I I don&#39;t
[5497.0s] really love looking at
[5501.119s] quarterly oh what happened here anyway
[5503.88s] it it&#39;s not it&#39;s not for me right now
[5505.679s] but uh I&#39;ll keep an open mind thoughts
[5508.119s] on Pepsi we&#39;ve covered this a few times
[5511.159s] uh Staples the whole thing
[5515.0s] I like the protein plays like horal I
[5517.0s] think this one&#39;s okay I wouldn&#39;t get
[5518.719s] excited about owning it but
[5523.159s] um I know the gp1s ETC that&#39;s why I like
[5526.36s] the protein plays dividend Aristocrat I
[5529.199s] you know I&#39;d probably be interested
[5531.48s] around 135 I&#39;d take a a close look you
[5534.719s] don&#39;t get too many chances to buy this
[5536.28s] business like this so yeah I think it&#39;s
[5538.04s] it&#39;s almost time I think it&#39;s a little
[5539.639s] early and um but I like I generally like
[5542.92s] the idea but
[5544.56s] there are some different headwinds that
[5546.36s] didn&#39;t exist so you got to be
[5548.0s] open-minded and that&#39;s why I need the
[5549.6s] price to be a lot lower like Diago on
[5552.6s] that basis uh what do you think about
[5554.679s] vistory group British homeb
[5558.08s] Builder 40% return on Capital employed
[5561.6s] 10 times earnings uh I don&#39;t know the
[5564.44s] British housing market well enough but
[5567.4s] let&#39;s take a
[5569.119s] look vistory group
[5576.679s] I do want more exposure to the UK than
[5578.84s] just
[5581.0s] gxo yeah I would listen to the call I
[5583.52s] did see some stuff about UK housing that
[5586.28s] wasn&#39;t good this week but uh let&#39;s see
[5589.52s] what this looks like
[5593.08s] here vty y.l
[5607.92s] yeah I mean this is going to be similar
[5609.159s] to the US home buildings it&#39;s just going
[5610.719s] to take a few years probably a year or
[5612.8s] two to bottom out or even more but I I
[5617.0s] think you&#39;re early and I think you&#39;re
[5618.8s] right
[5621.119s] um but I think you&#39;re going to have
[5622.96s] other
[5624.159s] opportunities let me just take a quick
[5626.119s] look at the uh financials and see if
[5628.719s] it&#39;s worth just putting in a flyer now
[5631.08s] and just waiting through the next year
[5632.84s] year and a half
[5637.44s] so it looks like they did some
[5647.159s] Acquisitions what&#39;s this negative free
[5649.32s] cash flow last year
[5652.4s] wait I guess they didn&#39;t report 2024 yet
[5655.76s] let&#39;s take a look at quarterly
[5664.239s] yeah it seems like it&#39;s turning the
[5666.119s] corner I would do I would do some more
[5667.719s] work on that I think that&#39;s kind of
[5674.96s] interesting it&#39;s always been a pretty
[5676.719s] lowquality business that tends to be the
[5678.679s] case with home
[5680.04s] builders
[5687.56s] um income statement
[5698.32s] yeah they&#39;re buying in wait a second no
[5701.719s] they&#39;re deluding they did they deluded
[5703.32s] shareholders by a lot probably for that
[5707.96s] deal I don&#39;t love it i&#39; I&#39;d probably
[5710.76s] take a few minutes to look at it more
[5712.159s] carefully but uh I think you got time
[5715.159s] and I think it&#39;s a good
[5716.52s] find
[5719.36s] um so let&#39;s go there
[5724.88s] all right Don
[5726.679s] L Este Lauder has two share classes and
[5729.48s] there is no direct way to influence the
[5730.679s] company as the family has majority
[5732.119s] voting rights what are your thoughts on
[5733.199s] this class structure I love it when it&#39;s
[5734.679s] family-owned just like Walmart was when
[5736.96s] they were in the dumps because they
[5738.48s] didn&#39;t have their internet strategy the
[5740.36s] families fix it and they fix it quickly
[5742.44s] I love that um the other thing too
[5746.679s] um you have to keep in mind is go ask
[5749.08s] your 10 and 12
[5751.36s] yearold nieces or daughters
[5755.36s] everyone thinks that Estee louder first
[5757.32s] off Estee louder is basically a China
[5759.8s] recovery play um and I think it&#39;s the
[5762.4s] recovery is going to be fantastic but
[5765.119s] um even you know most people think in
[5767.84s] the US that it&#39;s just a bunch of old
[5770.199s] ladies that are dying off and
[5773.48s] um it&#39;s never going to come back when I
[5775.76s] talk to the makeup
[5777.199s] people uh at Fox they&#39;re just like they
[5779.48s] own so many great Brands I mean if you
[5781.88s] ask your young kids they&#39;ll talk to
[5783.719s] about Dr jart plus they&#39;ll talk to you
[5786.32s] about
[5788.48s] um I think lab
[5792.4s] series uh and I
[5794.88s] think the ordinary and I think two-
[5798.08s] faced
[5799.84s] Origins you know you got
[5803.84s] Mac um so they&#39;re going to figure it out
[5806.4s] they&#39;ve been trading brand portfolio
[5808.119s] Brands just like VF Corp for over a
[5811.6s] century and family-owned businesses the
[5813.719s] beauty of them owning 38% of the company
[5816.56s] is that they&#39;ve got a lot more to lose
[5819.239s] than we do if they lose they lose
[5821.159s] everything if if we lose we our two
[5824.36s] things when we buy a company are number
[5826.719s] one is if this position were to go to
[5828.76s] zero because there could always be
[5830.32s] something that you don&#39;t know that you
[5831.679s] don&#39;t know and if you think otherwise uh
[5834.199s] you&#39;re not being rational uh would they
[5836.52s] take us out on a stretcher and the
[5837.639s] answer is always no it could go to zero
[5839.6s] and we&#39;d be fine and we&#39;d be able to
[5841.159s] outperform over a reasonable amount of
[5843.159s] time from from the remaining companies
[5844.44s] in the portfolio that&#39;s number one um
[5847.32s] they can if they lose this the you know
[5849.32s] chances are fourth fifth generation they
[5851.88s] can&#39;t go out and try out for the Mets uh
[5854.48s] and make a living so they&#39;re going to
[5855.56s] make sure they have the right people in
[5856.56s] to turn it around you got a new CEO that
[5858.56s] just did the kitchen syn quarter which
[5860.119s] is why
[5863.36s] um uh why it was down a little bit which
[5866.119s] happens every kitchen syn quarter with
[5867.639s] the new CEO first quarter Etc so uh I&#39;m
[5870.52s] not worried about that I&#39;m pretty
[5871.719s] confident in China and that&#39;s really the
[5874.04s] whole trade there um and it&#39;s a smaller
[5876.28s] position obviously our highest
[5877.28s] conviction China is Baba could you take
[5879.199s] a look at ymm full truck Alliance I
[5881.639s] don&#39;t buy smaller Chinese companies
[5884.0s] because I operate under the assumption
[5886.28s] I&#39;m not willing to take company and uh
[5888.639s] country risk um and so this probably
[5892.36s] works as a trade but it&#39;s too small too
[5895.599s] unknown too unproven for me probably
[5897.92s] works but I&#39;m more than willing to miss
[5899.92s] it my general premise with Baba was
[5902.52s] always that if go if Baba goes so does
[5905.44s] China so um I don&#39;t have any worries
[5907.92s] about fraud or much less than I would
[5911.04s] with something like full truck Alliance
[5912.56s] I know the company I know the numbers
[5914.119s] it&#39;s it&#39;s fine on paper but you can&#39;t
[5915.96s] trust the paper that&#39;s the problem so
[5918.199s] I&#39;ll leave it at that
[5922.0s] pzza we cover this pretty much every
[5924.36s] week and I every week I basically say me
[5927.56s] don&#39;t love it it&#39;ll probably work and my
[5930.56s] answer this week is probably going to be
[5932.08s] the exact same thing so starting to move
[5934.96s] uh probably take a little bit longer so
[5936.96s] you probably be able to buy it at 45 if
[5938.599s] you really love it I think that uh I
[5942.719s] don&#39;t love this trend of cash flow
[5945.08s] rolling back over but I think it&#39;s
[5946.8s] probably priced in
[5949.599s] enough um but I&#39;ve continued to say eh
[5953.719s] it&#39;s it&#39;s
[5955.52s] uh it&#39;s okay Brian
[5959.36s] Wilson do you think Trump&#39;s executive
[5961.88s] order revoking electronic vehicle
[5963.52s] electric vehicle mandate will have any
[5965.04s] negative impact on Alum yes that&#39;s why
[5967.28s] the stock&#39;s down everyone knew that
[5968.8s] that&#39;s not news so
[5972.52s] uh the whole story here is 40 million
[5975.8s] Global stock to 120 million by 2027 all
[5979.8s] driven by CH China fake subsidies and um
[5984.28s] the normal cyclicality of the lithium
[5986.0s] business them being the top producer
[5987.679s] with three and a half billion dollar
[5988.88s] liquidity Runway to wait for the cycle
[5990.88s] to turn and it will they&#39;ve all cut
[5992.599s] production and it will come back so uh
[5996.04s] there you go Lucas
[6001.88s] Bergman uh any semiconductor picks
[6004.48s] besides Intel
[6006.76s] no
[6008.84s] uh Mao boss
[6011.92s] ofart met Cole I&#39;ve seen a lot of people
[6015.04s] do
[6016.08s] that
[6018.92s] and uh lose a lot of
[6021.719s] money so I would
[6025.28s] say this is an example of like yeah of
[6027.88s] course Trump doesn&#39;t care you know like
[6030.32s] he wants all energy which is true but if
[6033.76s] you bet that
[6035.199s] way he got smoked in his
[6039.8s] first uh which one are you talking about
[6042.239s] Alpha
[6045.239s] metallurgical all these things just
[6049.199s] restructure every few years go bankrupt
[6051.56s] flush the shareholders come back out go
[6053.599s] straight up everyone thinks that they
[6055.599s] great businesses Alpha metallurgical I
[6058.44s] don&#39;t even
[6060.56s] know I like the contrarian thinking but
[6063.36s] I I don&#39;t want to play there it&#39;s a it&#39;s
[6065.56s] a
[6067.239s] trade let&#39;s see here AMR
[6084.639s] so it&#39;s up
[6087.56s] 125x and now it&#39;s pulled back 50% and
[6090.119s] you want to buy it here uh I think we
[6092.4s] covered this one before it looks
[6093.52s] familiar so the answer is
[6095.52s] no and then J apt what is your process
[6099.96s] to
[6103.96s] get DG he&#39;s asking
[6107.159s] about um we&#39;re not doing anything with
[6109.599s] DG but we&#39;re keeping our eye on Dollar
[6111.52s] General for sure these have been Smoked
[6113.08s] by teu if that Dom Minimus comes back I
[6115.679s] think this and Dollar Tree and
[6117.52s] everything else are going to be pretty
[6119.159s] good
[6119.96s] opportunities uh yeah they&#39;ll shut down
[6122.28s] a lot of stores um you got to get a
[6124.88s] sense of solvency risk but I think
[6127.28s] they&#39;ve got enough assets that they can
[6128.88s] sell off and cash flow let&#39;s take a look
[6132.159s] at the balance
[6141.84s] sheet f million cash six billion of debt
[6146.36s] so they&#39;ll probably have to close a
[6147.599s] bunch of stores I mean this is a levered
[6149.639s] play so you really got to keep your eye
[6151.04s] on
[6154.199s] um on free cash
[6157.32s] flow because that&#39;s going to be your
[6160.08s] Runway and even through all this looks
[6162.8s] okay they&#39;re going to you know it&#39;s it&#39;s
[6164.32s] just you know the issue with this one is
[6166.92s] that it&#39;s basically the same play as
[6168.719s] Advanced Auto Parts and I like Advanced
[6170.08s] Auto Parts better and I like the guy
[6171.44s] turning it around better so I don&#39;t need
[6172.76s] two of the the same thing it&#39;s basically
[6174.84s] uh retailing to lower end and uh I just
[6178.159s] think the necessity uh of what Advanced
[6181.52s] Auto Part sells and the areas where they
[6183.599s] control the market is a much better moat
[6185.88s] than you know selling cheap candy to
[6189.36s] people who shouldn&#39;t you know to
[6191.28s] whatever it&#39;s just not as good of a
[6193.119s] business but I like the idea can you
[6195.239s] take a look at Ashland
[6227.119s] okay cash flows turning down with price
[6229.8s] so you got to get some comfort I don&#39;t
[6231.92s] see revenues recovering
[6233.8s] yet margins have been
[6236.719s] choppy uh let&#39;s take a look at the
[6238.639s] balance
[6250.8s] sheet 300 million of cash 1.35 billion
[6254.48s] of
[6260.679s] debt they did have a pop of free cash
[6263.44s] flow how&#39;s that doing on a quarterly
[6277.44s] basis has always been a pretty low
[6279.52s] quality business let me just see
[6282.88s] here
[6287.4s] um specialty
[6290.119s] ingredients should special yeah all
[6292.48s] these are Dam like International
[6294.639s] fragrances and
[6296.44s] flavor uh darling what is this Sal
[6301.08s] tablet binders nutrition Solutions
[6303.119s] thickeners stabilizers
[6306.43s] [Music]
[6311.48s] emulsifiers I think if it gets into low
[6313.52s] 50 starts to do some more work but
[6319.92s] uh let me just see something here
[6325.88s] anal uh Financial income
[6329.28s] statement see what they&#39;re doing to the
[6331.199s] share
[6335.52s] count all right so they&#39;re not
[6337.239s] increasing the share count it seems like
[6339.36s] a cyclical business yeah it&#39;s probably
[6341.639s] getting close to okay uh I&#39;d need to do
[6344.04s] a lot more work and listen to management
[6345.76s] and understand that but like if you can
[6347.4s] buy this at 50% off uh which is not
[6349.96s] there yet it&#39;s probably kind of
[6351.8s] interesting uh but it&#39;s not a great
[6354.04s] business so it&#39;s more of a trade which
[6355.56s] is why I&#39;m I&#39;m a pass um
[6360.36s] Alex Evolution
[6362.679s] AB we cover this one very often uh I
[6366.32s] don&#39;t like this casino gambling business
[6368.36s] it&#39;s just too
[6371.36s] unpredictable uh this is online they can
[6374.719s] go when they go they go Yep this
[6379.28s] is we&#39;ll take a quick look at it
[6390.08s] Evolution
[6403.76s] AB yeah I mean everything looks great on
[6408.08s] this type of
[6409.4s] business until it doesn&#39;t and I&#39;ve seen
[6412.239s] these Cycles come and go so maybe this
[6413.88s] one&#39;s different but you got to tell me
[6415.639s] why and that takes a lot more work than
[6421.84s] doing a few minutes here
[6435.52s] um yeah I think this is more of a trait
[6437.92s] I think a lot of the juice is out of
[6439.119s] this lemon but uh you could definitely
[6440.84s] get a spike up to you know 13 or
[6443.48s] something like that but
[6446.199s] uh it&#39;s not for
[6448.48s] me all right Jimmy Jones
[6457.28s] again uh to share delution bother you on
[6461.119s] intel if they do it at a low price yes
[6463.48s] of course it bothers me but if they stay
[6464.84s] in business they will be able to start
[6467.08s] to generate cash and buy in shares and
[6470.199s] they will stay in business so that&#39;s a
[6471.8s] risk uh but um I think a lot of that is
[6475.52s] actually priced in uh know you I&#39;m not
[6478.32s] sure if you smoke but I got a potential
[6479.84s] cigar butt trade for you don&#39;t smoke
[6482.8s] kave but um let&#39;s
[6494.36s] see g p r
[6497.639s] o yeah I know there&#39;s a big name in this
[6500.92s] uh I I never like no not for me pass
[6504.44s] good luck with uh smoking causes cancer
[6506.88s] so just beware Zen Jason Zen uh not
[6511.599s] seeing what Bill Amman is seeing in Uber
[6513.76s] now that he&#39;s taking a 1% position in
[6515.36s] the
[6516.719s] company uh it&#39;s not what we do I&#39;ll
[6519.08s] leave that one
[6521.599s] to Mr
[6523.52s] Amman but
[6526.8s] um I mean you really have to obviously
[6531.119s] dar&#39;s done a good job running the
[6532.44s] business
[6535.08s] um you have to have some view on what&#39;s
[6536.84s] going to happen with autonomous and how
[6538.36s] it&#39;s going to impact them and This falls
[6540.84s] into the predict the future category
[6543.239s] which
[6546.239s] uh on the one
[6548.4s] hand
[6555.36s] is possible but it&#39;s not probable and I
[6558.199s] think things are going to change so much
[6559.28s] in this space so he&#39;s kind of got double
