welcome to hedge fun tips with Tom Hayes I&#39;m Tom Hayes and this is your 278th videoast podcast for the week ending February 13 2025 got a lot of great stuff to cover today uh first we&#39;ll do a little bit of uh uh family and life stuff so uh that was me this week uh at the yesterday at the New York Stock Exchange uh pretty exciting never gets old uh that&#39;s in front of one of the studios that&#39;s with Kristen Scher up in the booth we did a great segment together that&#39;s with Diane King Hall she used to be at Yahoo she&#39;s now at Schwab network uh and uh more there and then this was the crew ladies and gentlemen uh we like to get together for dinner every few months when we&#39;re all in town uh you know these faces from Fox Business uh Lou Bassin obviously Kevin man uh Adam Johnson and you&#39;ve got Kenny pokari you got John loty you got Mark teer and you have Greg farinello we just had a wonderful time Brazilian steakhouse great time then on uh Tuesday I had the chance to join David asmin on Varan company want to thank Preston myelle Christian dagger and Co and obviously uh Stu Varney for having me on for that segment we&#39;re going to listen in here group led by Elon Musk has made a bid to his former partner for a takeover of open AI love this story how much is he I couldn&#39;t believe it when I heard it last night so the Wall Street Journal says it&#39;s a 97.4 billion bid it&#39;s for the nonprofit that controls open AI the maker of chat GPT and the timing this is coming right when open AI is transitioning to a for-profit company and Elon Musk is trying to stop all of that so the openi CEO is Elon musk&#39;s arch rival who his former partner by the former they founded this company together about a decade ago so Sam Alman responded to this unsolicited bid by Elon Musk on X saying No thank you but we will buy Twitter which is now called X for 9.74 billion if you want he just moved the decimal point over one right and he&#39;s saying you&#39;ve done nothing with this company um but that 97.4 billion offer for open AI doesn&#39;t that seem cheap I mean considering with the latest uh funding expected to come in val about just to kind of put it in your face Elon you know take your money and shove it all right Lauren thank you very much Tom Hayes joins me now Tom I do love it when billionaires have these spats particularly ones that were were&#39;re former partners I I wonder if some of it though is being made up just in order to get attention for what they&#39;re doing well this is uh high stakes poker for sure Elon Musk does not want to see soft bank&#39;s $40 billion investment at a $260 billion valuation so we offered a third So Soft bank will have to go back to their shareholders and say no it&#39;s really worth 260 billion it&#39;s not worth 97 billion and Sam Alman going back well you you paid 44 billion for for x uh maybe it&#39;s only worth 9.7 billion so I I think this is just back and forth but the stakes are high what he should be doing is making an offer for deep seek uh and and getting that model at a at a discount a significant discount to what they&#39;re doing at open AI you&#39;ve got faster models you&#39;re seeing it with Alibaba if you believe them there&#39;s a lot of these models from deep deep sake are now being questioned whether they&#39;re as good as they claimed they were that&#39;s fair but you have competition from Alibaba quen 2.5 is showing uh faster faster performance in term against deep seek Etc so there are a lot of models coming from all over the world Stakes are high everyone wants a piece of this you wanted in deep seek Elon Musk those are the open source models and Sam Alman is closed Source model so I hear the argument is for the open source which might be the way to get everybody on board and make this stuff move faster next one bre does the threat of of the Trump tariffs change your investment policy at all yeah I think what we&#39;re seeing um Trump is trying to even things up our simple average tariffs are 3.3% if you look at India they&#39;re 177% if you look at Brazil they&#39;re 11% if you look at China they&#39;re 7.5% so he&#39;s trying to even things up what&#39;s this going to affect steel and aluminum uh it&#39;s going to affect heavy machinery it&#39;ll increase the cost for Caterpillar deer it&#39;s estimated and that&#39;s why that&#39;s why the value of the stocks the US stocks that that are in aluminum and steel have been way up over the past couple of days yeah in terms of the steel producers that&#39;s going to help our national security Etc in terms of the impact to the finished goods caterpillar deer a lot of this is already priced in they&#39;re not down that much this morning and and that&#39;s a good thing Tom Hayes great to see you thank you very much for being here coming up and we&#39;re back then I had the uh pleasure to join Oliver renick and Tom white on Schwab Network to talk some Alibaba thanks to Heidi Schultz we&#39;re going to listen in here all right we&#39;re looking at stocks you&#39;re trying to catch a bid this morning let&#39;s keep talking sell-offs and dip buying opportunities one of them has been in China as the trade starts to firm back up joining us Thomas J Hayes chairman and managing member at Great Hill capital and Mr Tom white here with me in studio uh Thomas you&#39;re looking for dips to buy the China dip had uh really been there the last year is it starting to come back no question about it Oliver thanks for having me uh we&#39;ve been in Baba for almost 2 years now and we are more investors than Traders so we&#39;ve bought in the hundreds and we bought a ton in the60s so our BAS is around $83 this is an absolute no-brainer we look at intrinsic value we think is well in excess of $200 per share uh this is the number one cloud provider in China uh obviously you had the announcement yesterday that apple is going to be using alibaba&#39;s AI for uh Apple intelligence which was a big news but uh only part of the story here complete play on the middle class recovery with tbal and t-all as the one and a half years of non-stop stimulus is starting to kick in in the economy International growing up 40% so there are a lot of you know if you play poker Oliver there are a lot of outs a lot of things to low Alibaba and uh you know it&#39;s had a huge move in the last few weeks so probably consolidate for the next few weeks but any weakness in the coming months is an opportunity to buy for the long term in our view love me some outs but I also like equity and getting my money in good uh is this a draw you need something to come to fruition here or is um the trade past 120 basically a breakout because um that&#39;s a level that has rejected Al Baba time and time again basically 120 yeah look we were buying Alibaba before it was cool with David and and he put 37% of his portfolio in China uh certainly the 120 level has been a been a a problem maybe we knock on the door again and don&#39;t get through for a few weeks for a couple of months take that weakness cuz once we get through they&#39;re not going to let anyone in this is going to go to intrinsic value this is a theme we&#39;ve seen this theme since July of last year broadening what have we seen the beginning of this year Europe equities outperform us equities uh equal weight have outperformed cap weight mag 7 earnings growth is decelerating and guess what China Tech has outperformed US tech by a wide margin this year we believe that trend is going to continue and what most people don&#39;t know is that&#39;s exactly what happened in Trump 1.0 everyone thought Chinese stocks would do horribly if you look from 2017 and 2018 one of the biggest runs in the shortest period of time in Alibaba in Chinese Tech Etc so so we really like the runway moving forward any consolidation next next couple of months great opportunity for the long term some of the parts in our view uh well over $200 a share such a good point too on how China performed we were hearing that from our own Jeff Klein top Tom about International out performance both on the year and the way China traded uh in the first Trump term you got a bot trade uh tell me what you see in the options yeah well they&#39;ve got earnings next Thursday so that&#39;s going to be a key uh point to uh take a look at maybe uh some weakness after the games that we&#39;ve seen so far this year up 18% just in February so it&#39;s had a great run uh already so I looked at something a little bit more conservative in the option side trying to take advantage of that higher implied volatility level that we&#39;re seeing in the shares after this runup and the earnings event so going out to that February 21st monthly cycle so just N9 days to expiration I&#39;m going to sell an out of- the money put for vertical uh to take advantage of a neutral to bullish type stance here where I&#39;m going to sell the 110 strike put and then buy the 105 strike put you want to stay risk toine going into uh this event risk with earnings uh $5 wide short neutral to bullish put vertical collecting roughly about $130 credit on it that&#39;s what you can make on 130 bucks you&#39;ve got about $370 in Risk on that one but it takes your break even all the way down to 10870 to the downside that&#39;s about 7% below the current share price so you&#39;re giving yourself that cushion to the downside where you can profit in three out of four scenarios uh on this move but this is a really shortterm just a trade to take advantage of that higher implied volatility okay uh so there is still a good bit of volatility in here in the premium which I mean makes sense this thing is moving fast yep and the earnings next Thursday that&#39;s going to be key okay uh man 80 to 116 in a hurry this year for Alibaba what a what a wild chart uh by the way that kind of U shape almost a v from the October highs and now back to them Hey Thomas one other one you like here I want to make sure I get your thoughts on is Paypal uh which has come off and it&#39;s done it around earnings uh pretty big gap down on the last report what&#39; you make of that and does it concern you at all yeah same exact story we&#39;ve been in this one for a while buying every single dip basis $62 it ran right up to $90 Alex Chris is an unbelievable CEO came from into it uh he&#39;s applied a lot of those same strategies the reason the stock sold off on earnings was the market was upset that they feel that growth is slowing it&#39;s not slowing he&#39;s firing unprofitable customers because he wants to generate free cash flow and buyback stock they did $6.8 billion dollar of free cash flow in 2024 he&#39;s sandbagging again in 2025 setting expectations low 6 to 7 billion of free cash flow if last year&#39;s any prologue in terms of his sandbagging they&#39;ll probably do 8 billion of free cash flow look this is a $75 billion market cap they just announced they&#39;re going to buy $15 billion worth of stock they&#39;re going to buy in 20% of the company they&#39;ve got venmo is a verb they&#39;ve got fast lane checkout that&#39;s doing phenomenal this business is going to be great great leader great turnaround story it&#39;ll be back up to 90 we estimate intrinsic value up around 120 it may take a year to two years to get there this is a high quality durable growing business that&#39;s generating cash like it&#39;s going out of style convincing and I like to hear it because uh my narrative on PayPal has been pretty similar I was kind of confused why the stock was so hated for basically you know uh 18 out of the last 24 months so seems like it has totally revamped the way we bank and the way we move money around thanks a lot Thomas appreciate the conviction calls and the details there and of course a nice poker reference always a good way to get on my good side Tom give me a PayPal trade well I know why the stock was down because they&#39;re uh they&#39;re uh you know users across all their platforms was actually decelerating but as Thomas mentioned the new CEO Alex Chris is making some uh solid changes and good Partnerships here so I looked at something a little bit more aggressive here but giving myself duration the stocks pulled back about 11% so far this year after that poor earnings report and it wasn&#39;t a bad report it was just poor guidance and maybe uh some profit taking after that big runup uh but I looked at something a little bit more aggressive going out a couple months to the April monthly cycle uh so you&#39;ve got about 64 days till expiration on this one where I&#39;m going to buy the at the money 75 strike call and then to offset some of the cost because maybe it goes up but maybe it just doesn&#39;t explode back to 90 bucks sell the 85 strike call so a bullish $10 wide call vertical to the upside you&#39;re paying roughly about a 340 debit for that so that&#39;s going to be your risk on that trade takes your break even up to 7840 on this one that&#39;s only uh about 4% above the current share price so you don&#39;t need a monster move to the upside you just expect over the next couple months that we&#39;re going to start making up some of those losses that we&#39;ve seen uh post earnings on this one uh but pretty straightforward and because you&#39;re buying the vertical Oliver you have a little bit more flexibility as far as trade management so if the stock does pop up towards you know above 80 bucks a share and this thing expands to maybe double you can start taking off parts of your position or the entire position ahead of expiration you don&#39;t have to wait for it because you&#39;re buying the vertical and gives you some flexibility all right all right buying a call vertical buying upside baa buying it in PayPal and um taking advantage of volatility where it&#39;s elevated um more elevated in Baba it seems like okay thanks for the trades and we&#39;re back and then finally I had a chance to join Kristen Scher always have great interviews with her General market overview couple picks want to thank Mel montz Jeff Cohen for having me on we&#39;ll listen in here joining me in studio is our Market expert today Thomas hay he&#39;s the chair managing member at Great Hill Capital Thomas great to have you great to be here Kristen so a lot to digest of course a choppy but higher starts of the year now this inflation report stocks set to drop about 1% at the open what are the takeaways well I think a couple of things I think Goldman Sachs and JP Morgan set up the street they said if it came in this hot the market was going to be down 1 and a 12% to 2% it&#39;s kind of consistent with the February seasonality uh this is the second worst month of the year historically and in a postelection year February is down on average 1.3% so I think we got to buckle up buttercup this might be a little bit of uh turbulence here for the next few weeks uh there will be a knee-jerk reaction to the inflation report 10e yield was at 480 went down to 450 now it&#39;s back at 463 do we go back and test 480 again maybe maybe not we&#39;re not going to five uh bessin and Trump have already said they want to Target the 10-year yield uh so I think actually what you&#39;re going to see before we get to five we might actually move to four because there are deflationary actions in place namely with Doge they are cutting costs with a machete they are laying off a lot of people that&#39;s going to be deflationary that&#39;s going to hurt the the jobs Market a little bit uh that will offset but we&#39;re not going to see that right away so right now it&#39;s an immediate knee-jerk reaction to inflation and we&#39;re going to see that today yeah so uh just in about two hours one hour I guess we&#39;ll hear from the FED chare uh here on the East Coast but I am curious Thomas how tariffs factor into this because since the last time we spoke we have heard a wave of tariff tariffs announced by the administration yeah if you if you look at the effect of tariffs historically you do get shortterm pop in prices intermediate term it normalizes and actually if you look at washing machines and so on uh shortly thereafter actually prices are lower a couple of years out so it&#39;s kind of a short short-term impact in terms of the tariffs uh again volatility that we&#39;re we&#39;re going to see here with the new Administration and new headline every day welcome to Trump 2.0 same as Trump 1.0 a new tweet a new new set of volatility so let&#39;s talk about some of your picks within the backdrop of this Market yeah so uh when we came on uh uh early this year we said that this is going to be a different type of year mag mag 7 is not going to be the leader we&#39;re going to see broadening well what has happened in the first 6 weeks here uh the 493 equal weight has outperformed the mag 7 cap weight so that&#39;s new Europe equities have actually outperformed us equities and value has outperformed growth three things that weren&#39;t on most people&#39;s Bingo cards but they heard it right here on Kristen scholer show at the live at the NYSC so that&#39;s going to continue so what&#39;s up next I think what could be up next is small cap starts to outperform large cap uh and Emerging Markets start to outperform develop markets why because you&#39;re getting earnings growth for lower multiples in all those areas that are starting to broaden out and starting to outperform uh this inflation report is going to be an opportunity for dividend yielders so yields are going to blow out they&#39;re going to get sold off in the next couple of days and then you want to buy some of these defensive stocks one that we like is crown castle it has a 7% dividend yield 40,000 cell phone towers they are a leader in that business but what&#39;s been holding them back is their fiber business is very Capital intensive takes a lot of investment and a very low return on that investment Capital they&#39;re selling that off to Z group for $8 billion that&#39;ll enable them to buy back stock pay down debt it&#39;ll be a great thing for shareholders 7% pretty impressive right especially in this environment where high yield savings is maybe yielding you 3 and a half% and bonds would be lower as well correct and you have capital appreciation potential once they get rid of that albatross around their neck uh this stock can really move up quite a bit so you get paid while you wait you get some capital appreciation over the next two years next couple of days use this opportunity to take advantage what does this mean for deals yeah the overall market look this Market is primed for a lot of IPO paper in the next 12 to 24 months in the short term you&#39;re probably not going to get your deal out in the next couple of weeks we&#39;re have a little rockiness a little bit of volatility um another defensive stock that we&#39;re looking at in this context is horel the maker of spam of of all things spam spam horel chili all the protein snacks that people need whether they&#39;re just normally eating or whether they&#39;re on gp1s which is the new trend uh they want high protein stuff uh Skippy Planters Etc this has been kind of mismanaged since 2016 that CEO is leaving Jim C uh it&#39;s got a 3.7% dividend yield and they&#39;ve been raising the dividend every single year for 59 years it&#39;s a dividend Aristocrat now that is a serious track record right that&#39;s right 59 years is a long way so let&#39;s talk a bit about bonds Thomas I know you mentioned obviously dividend stocks how do bonds look to you at these levels yeah so I think you&#39;ll get this knee-jerk you&#39;re going to get an intermediate term selloff right now 10-year yields probably going to go back up to 480 somewhere in that neighborhood any weakness in bonds is to be bought okay the deflationary forces of Doge uh and cutting and Etc and the Slowdown that uh could could be short-term impact of tariffs you could get a slowing of growth as well uh will be an opportunity to buy bonds right now there were two crowded trades coming into this year number one was long mag 7 what&#39;s been the worst performer mag 7 the second most crowd trade is short bonds everyone shorting Bonds in the whole today they&#39;re going to feel smart in four weeks they&#39;re not going to be so happy interesting so would you buy the dip uh in bonds for sure in the next few days I&#39;d be buying bonds left and right if we see uh underperformance in February historically which is what happens what about that for equities for equities for sure this is where you want to get out your shopping list in the next two weeks you&#39;re going to have opportunities to buy great businesses it&#39;s no impact this will be a tiny little blip on the screen when you look back three three months from now use this as an opportunity this is how you make money you you don&#39;t sell in the hole you buy in the hole when you&#39;re buying high quality businesses Kristen Thomas hay chair and managing member of great Hill Capital Thomas always a pleasure and thanks for joining me in studio thanks for having me great to have you and we&#39;re back so now you have pretty much the general overview finally want to thank uh shawat chuhan and sucti gupa for including me in their article on Reuters and let&#39;s get to the quotes of the week uh this is from Peter Lynch when stocks are attractive you buy them sure they can go lower uh he says I&#39;ve bought stocks at $12 that went to $2 but later went to 30 you just don&#39;t know when you can find the bottom the key is knowing the underlying fundamentals knowing what you own which we cover every single week Charlie Munger the big money is not in the buying or the selling but in the waiting uh we&#39;re seeing that play out with Alibaba for sure and then Peter Lynch the trick is not to learn to trust your gut feelings but rather to discipline yourself to ignore them Stand by Your stocks as long as the fundamental story of the company hasn&#39;t changed so we&#39;re going to cover some of that let&#39;s get down to uh economic Market data here um missed a couple photos here this was uh Mimi trying steak tartar for her first time ever at Eddie V&#39;s which was UN best steak tartar I&#39;ve ever had didn&#39;t think that was going to happen that&#39;s in front of the New York Stock Exchange that&#39;s in the vanney studio and I and that&#39;s with my buddy Kenny pocari I got to do his show on Yahoo finance that&#39;ll be out next week uh in front of Fox on the desk at Varan Co so I share that for the new people tuning in for the first time give you a behind the-scenes look you can see here I look the best in this photo out of all of them because of wonderful Yasha does Works her makeup Magic on me and we got to talk about all different brands you can guess which brands I asked her about which she was pretty uh upbeat on which is pretty good to see uh okay let&#39;s get down to data analysts are raising European earnings forecasts uh value has outperformed growth uh and Europe has outperformed the US and 493 has outperformed mag 7 so far this year this has been a theme we&#39;ve been pounding the table when it was unpopular now everyone is coming on board and that&#39;s the beginning of a trend you can see these mag s Mania question mark you can see previous bubbles whether it was oil whether it was home prices whether it was a NASDAQ in 200000 whether it was the Nik in the late 80s uh gold in the 70s nifty50 in the 60s Etc it doesn&#39;t mean that it&#39;s going to crash down like the all of these did it just means that there may be better places for outperformance in the 12 to 24 months and that&#39;s been our theme we started pounding the table in Q4 a lot of you came in uh uh early this year and I was you know I never um promote you know uh people coming in they come in or they don&#39;t come in I it makes no difference for me I eat one cheeseburger a day it&#39;s fine but uh a lot of you came in for q1 at the right time because I I emphasized it and and it&#39;s just been a rocket ship uh right after the inauguration based on how we&#39;re positioned not for the General market overall uh and um and that&#39;s pretty exciting so uh and for existing clients uh also super duper exciting so percent of S&amp;P 500 total market cap with price to sales greater than 10x again this points to some of the extremes like I just shared on some of those previous historic bubbles um you know this was the basically if you go back you know 100 years this was one of the this was the only decade where you could buy a basket of stocks trading at 10 10 time sales and actually outperform the S&amp;P 500 uh historically every decade it&#39;s pretty much a guaranteed way to lose 90% of your money in two to three years um and that was a function of Zer we&#39;re not going back to Zer any anytime soon uh you saw the inflation numbers yesterday however uh January of the last two years is surprised to the upside so don&#39;t expect that to persist you got a lot of people getting laid off with Doge they going to be counter trending forces uh but we&#39;re not going back to zero interest rate policy moving along PE S&amp;P PE ratio on a trailing 12month operating EPS uh again you know going back to 1940 uh growth versus value extremes like we saw in 200000 1940 and uh 2022 just before we had the tech crash in 2022 where we were able to buy Alibaba and Google at huge discounts in in October 2022 when no one wanted them at easy doubles and then uh now we&#39;re getting back to those extremes so here you go a lot of people are coming on to our point of view why because the price is down 20% on a lot of these names opinion follows Trend they didn&#39;t tell you ahead of time they told you after the fact but uh better late than never I guess total returns 2000 to 2006 small cap value 16.6% annualize 185% cumulative returns I think we&#39;re setting up to an environment just like this small cap has not outperformed large cap year-to date yet even though Europe has outperformed uh us and 493 is outperformed uh mag 7 and all the other things are starting to play out I think that&#39;s the next phase I think Emerging Markets is already happening China Tech is dramatically outperforming US tech us mag 7 uh and up until a day or two ago Tech was the only sector in the US negative or flat on the year so uh you know seeing Healthcare remember the last be first some of the materials are starting to perk up Etc uh also during that period when Amazon was dropping 80 80 90% Cisco was getting bashed Enron uh Worldcom all the Darlings Global Crossing uh value was up 69% during that period uh S&amp;P did fine because the weights came down uh but underperformed getting the right exposure with small cap in international uh this table doesn&#39;t have international but dramatic outperformance in China during that period and uh I continue to reemphasize these themes because number one it&#39;s working and number two it&#39;s just math and understanding everything is cyclical and um if you pay attention to extremes rather than chase them you can make incredible uh uh returns over time so postelection year seasonal pattern this is when we get the chop the second half of February hang on to your horses that might be in the indices it may not necessarily be in all the names but don&#39;t expect miracles I mean we&#39;ve had some really big down days in the market uh the last 6 weeks and our portfolios have been up on those days so we&#39;re just positioned perfectly so far uh but um uh February June September you got to expect draw downs and that&#39;s just the way it is and uh you just hold your businesses if you lik them two weeks ago uh you&#39;re going to love them in the next two weeks so uh evolution of Atlanta fed GDP now you know it&#39;s interesting about Alibaba it actually shot up to like like 127 overnight so it broke through that 120 barrier and I was thinking wow well I&#39;ll take that I mean I I was on the morning before saying hey we&#39;re you know knocking up on this 120 here don&#39;t be surprised if we consolidate these gains for a couple of months and shake out all the people chasing back up at 120 and scare them out at you know low 100s or or 110 or something like that uh just like every single move and then once we break through 120 materially just you know they won&#39;t let anyone in is what I said on Schwab with Oliver and Tom uh and we just busted through it last night came back in this morning uh I think finished up pretty strong looks like about yeah 119 and change so I would not be shocked if we can solidate that because a lot of people chased up overnight last night and got smashed or down 10 points already so they&#39;ll be panicking out of their fomo margin and um and that&#39;s that so um uh don&#39;t worry about that everything is on track with that theme evolution of Atlanta fed GDP now at about 3% not stuff you see in recessions here are the Cycle composits 14 and 10 years going back to uh 19 uh let&#39;s see it&#39;s probably going back to 1950 and this is that chop in the second two half so bun stuff pointing to that but we told you that in the last few weeks so just be be aware and when it happens don&#39;t be surprised and just sit tight nothing changed to the underlying businesses uh AFC winners have been good for the Bulls lately yeah this is an after Thea thing before the fact they said if Philadelphia wins it&#39;s going to be the end of the world uh you know it&#39;s it&#39;s coincident not causal I hope you don&#39;t believe it&#39;s causal or um you know my condolences uh to your Investment Group here uh progression of magnificent 7th quarterly sales surprises this is something that hasn&#39;t happened since 2022 when you had the tech wreck uh which is you had uh zero percentage of sales surprises okay quarterly sales surprises so in aggregate so that&#39;s a that&#39;s a thing and then uh magnificent 7 year-to date was -3 basis points while the xmag 7 was 2 2.8% and the S&amp;P 500 2.7% this actually got more extreme what date is that uh as of anyway uh and then you can see here what we cover every single week S&amp;P earnings growth of the unmagnify is growing mag 7 is decelerating multiple is still too high hasn&#39;t derated enough yet whereas this multiple is low and should start to play catch up and rate over time uh the outperformance of The Magnificent 7 has historically reflected its earning superiority 2025 Bottoms Up estimates imply excess earnings growth uh will narrow for the Magnificent 7 32 percentage points in uh oh it was 32 percentage points excess in 2024 to only six in 2025 and four in 2026 so decelerating earnings growth uh huge premium multiple 33 times versus 22 times for the S&amp;P versus Maybe 18 times for The X mag 7 or equal weight and then if you look at small versus large International versus demestic that the spreads are even larger and the chickens are coming home to roost and uh we are gathering chickens like it&#39;s going out of style uh is the tide turning returns through 25 2025 this is Europe versus the S&amp;P 500 dramatic out performance uh it looks like about 7 8% excuse me uh looks like about 3 4% outperformance already year to date percentage of international buyers in Los Angeles County so this is Chinese buyers um parking money you can see this is starting you know this peak during covid this is starting to diminish I think this is going to diminish even further it&#39;s funny when we bought a house out here I said to my wife I was like you know so you want me to buy the top in in Orange County and sell the bottom in Connecticut uh maybe you haven&#39;t been paying attention to do what to what I do for a living for over two decades and how how we have the ability to do all this uh but uh we played the smart game we rented out Connecticut so that can appreciate uh the houses there and uh we got a nice situation here but I think that Orange County real estate uh if passes any prologue looking back to the Japanese uh and the Orange County housing crisis in the early 90s I think what&#39;s happening now is the Chinese were panicked when they were in lockdown getting their money out anyway which way they could easy way to park it they got a ton in Los Angeles but even more in Orange County Newport particularly in the nice areas and they&#39;re just most of them are empty it&#39;s just a store of value for them with a negative carry um and I think as equities take off and they see new opportunities and the the re the regulation has come back in down and the stimulus has gone up I think they&#39;re going to get serious fomo fomo is a universal thing it&#39;s not by uh uh nationality it&#39;s it&#39;s a human condition uh most people get the the fomo gene I was blessed not to get the fomo Gene and um I think the marginal Chinese buyer parking their money is going to be less incentivized to get money out of China in the next year to two when everything is going up property&#39;s recovering you you&#39;re going to talk about some of the Articles stock markets recovering they&#39;re going to want to make these incredible returns and like everyone else opinion follows Trend now they&#39;re going to get excited about China so it&#39;s not that they&#39;re going to sell everything and bring the money back to China because it&#39;s so hard to get out but the marginal buyer is going to continue to decline and once that final bit marginal bid evaporates it&#39;s it&#39;s a huge air pocket and um so uh so we&#39;ll see what happens and there could be interesting opportunities in the next few years out here uh Bank of America bull bear indicator not what you see at extremes here is the multi-year Twin Peaks in Long data treasury bonds we&#39;ve covered this this is the most important Point uh in my view these dollar and treasury fake outs are going to get reversed bessent and Trump have said as much they&#39;re going to focus on that doge is moving ahead at a break neck speed they&#39;re laying off a lot of people take people a lot of people taking packages that are not necessarily going to be absorbed by the uh private sector because they probably don&#39;t have um a decent portion of them don&#39;t have uh transferable skills um to earn commensurate income and they&#39;re going to think that anyway the point is that their deflationary forces intact which is going to be very good for bond yields coming down which is going to be very and dollar coming down which is going to be very good for international tariffs here still at 100-year lows uh went up for 12 years before you saw smooth Holly so people who keep pointing to small hully Smoot Holly haven&#39;t read history books you had 10 years of prosperity with tariffs increasing uh reciprocal tariffs is a great idea because the net effect is most people are going to want tariffs to come down so rather than us our tariffs going up theirs are going to come down it&#39;s going to be more free trading and uh better for velocity of money globally which increases the standard of living China less reliant on US exports today so they&#39;re not you know it&#39;s only 2.8% of their GDP so they&#39;re not going to really be bullied that you saw them do the reciprocal tariff so I think there&#39;s going to be more incentive to cooperate versus not talk and blame like the previous administration uh which caused an awful lot of problems and um uh the most important problem that it created in my view is deep seek because once you block them from having chips they you know necessity is the mother of invention now they&#39;re independent and on many metrics they&#39;re outperforming us at the moment that won&#39;t necessarily continue but they will have something comparable where they can compete and we saw it in alibaba&#39;s announcement Etc AI capex relief for semis you see Intel going straight through the roof with JD Vance&#39;s comments which is pretty exciting weak demand uh are tracking at the lowest level in over two years so that&#39;s good mentions of a bottom sword in 20 24% year on year the biggest jump in history uh so those are the type of things you saw at the covid lows at the great financial crisis lows uh and this is you know by and large the 493 companies the non- magn UNM magnificent 493 are the ones saying mentions of a bottom so that&#39;s positive for the rest of the indices which means you could see subdued index with still the overweight in mag 7 but the rest of the company&#39;s doing extremely well not moving the needle on the indices for all the people that are crowded in into the crowded passive trade uh but really exciting for the people in the active management uh earnings are expected to broaden out from here we see now see the data here percentage of stocks outgrowing the mag 7 is climbing again in a material way uh just like you saw in 2020 and 2021 which is awesome time and also in 2014 through 2 this doesn&#39;t really go back far enough but it&#39;s a positive thing again I can&#39;t reemphasize this chart and not ladies and gentlemen decelerating earnings withow mag 7 accelerating earning growth 493 and um similar situation in terms of prices what you pay values what you get uh International versus us that cycle is going to come back we&#39;ve shown that chart a few times hyperscalers capex growth to remain strong in 2025 people view that as a positive the problem is is in the intermediate term call it two to three years we&#39;re seeing 0% return on invested capital and what it&#39;s doing is it&#39;s crowding out money for BuyBacks which has been a huge part of the stock growth and it&#39;s lowering the return on invested Capital which is uh forcing analyst to start to think reating now it may be true that 5 years from now they are going to have a return on invested Capital like none other but right now for everyone thinks that this is the opportunity of a lifetime this is fomo defensive spending not to get left in the dust they don&#39;t know what the return is going to be or how it&#39;s going to be my guess is it will be great but it will be many years out so in the meantime like when you saw meta go down to $8 when um uh Zuckerberg would was going to spend billions on the metaverse uh once shareholders saw that there was no return they basically revolted and he finally got the message and he flipped around and it&#39;s just been a home run ever since um hyperscale is capex as a percentage of operating cash flows expected to remain high again that&#39;s going to impact margins return on invested capital and ultimately the multiple CEO is expecting higher capex over the next 6 months Rose to the highest level since Q4 2022 this is part of our manufacturing recovery theme manufacturing has been in a depression for 2 years mag s stocks haven&#39;t been able to keep Pace with the broader market so far and uh we think at the end of the year we&#39;ll look back that will be the case for the full year Chinese investors snapping up Hong Kong stocks that was part of our core thesis with the Dual listing that the Chinese were going to be able to buy more and more through the stock connect that has been the case especially for Baba uh just rocketing overnight uh I&#39;d love to see it just hovering here between 119 and 108 for the next two months and just scare everyone out and uh get phone calls like oh is it going to hit the resistance again blah blah blah uh while the fund so maybe maybe earnings they&#39;ll be conservative and that&#39;ll be the excuse for them for it to trade down for a little bit knock out the weak sisters one more time just punish them again and then straight up to much much higher level so excited for that year on-year growth in the S&amp;P cash use so you can see here a massive decline in BuyBacks relative to capex uh this is going to hurt EPS on the mag 7 because that&#39;s where all the capex is bottom up consensus expects narrow mag 7 versus uh 493 earnings growth Gap so we covered this already you can see it was 33% last year mag 7 outperformed in terms of earnings growth to the 493 and that starts to narrow the problem is is the multiple hasn&#39;t narrowed mag 7 33 times maybe a little less now xmag 7 call it 18 19 times uh and a lot of them a lot lower and uh accelerating uh closing in earnings growth moving along PE evaluations relative to history so you can see kind of where there&#39;s the greater growth um a greater opportunity in terms of the spread uh and then the absolute so the relative multiple and then the absolute multiple the absolute multiple they&#39;re basically saying real estate and energy are the only Bargains the relative multiple Staples I see a lot of opportunity there which is why I talked to to Kristen about a Staples name uh materials same story uh healthc care all the things that we&#39;ve been preaching about uh if you believe in value for money here&#39;s msci China around 10 10 times multiple down from 20 times at its peak and here is uh S&amp;P 500 uh trading at you know looks like about 24 25 on the basis of this Bloomberg chart China&#39;s Tech firm stage a rebound this year that actually broke out to new highs overnight uh here&#39;s from Ryan Dietrich uh again if stocks break the December low it&#39;s a warning side like 2025 did so what he&#39;s saying is the average return in years that they broke which we did because of the mag 7 um uh average return is flat to negative so negative 20 basis points uh I could see that I could see mag 7 being negative bringing the indices to flat and and some of the other names being up 50 100 150% uh that are beach balls underwater I mean you know Baba&#39;s already up what 50% in the last couple of months so uh healthc care single stock flows flip positive we talked about that last Shelby first same with materials flipping positive uh value ETFs outpacing growth ETFs everything we set you up with before the end of the year and told you we were going to do is now happening this actually broke Above This level meaningfully last night um and I think it&#39;s still holding there by the way uh but I would love to see after earnings just grind for a couple of months in here and really just take any possible believer all these weak sisters that just bought up here overnight 10 points I mean 10-point move overnight I was at the airport just laughing I was like these guys are going to get slacked and um so there you go Chinese cloud-based lag us peers in growth um so you can see Alibaba Cloud intelligence growth ratio is growing basically the fastest Microsoft and Amazon have been flat their growth rate uh Buu has been going down Amazon is picking up share Alibaba excuse me Alibaba Cloud intelligence is picking up share in the Chinese Cloud business growth which is exciting to see and then uh and it&#39;s still early days they&#39;re five years behind us in terms of just basic digitization and compute uh core CPI auto insurance and shelter have contributed to the rise if you take that out which I don&#39;t know uh you get to 1.9% this is from Tom Le over at fund Strat is like yeah if you take everything out you get to zero but uh there you go CH US inflation rate but I like how he breaks that down very useful information all the time and um he again just a reminder for those of you who new literally there were like three four five people that were publicly bullish in the hole in October 2022 when everyone was selling in the hole the biggest billionaire hedge fund managers and I don&#39;t even need to say more than that for you to know who I&#39;m talking about we&#39;re we&#39;re telling people to sell when the market was down 27% unbel and we were on this every week telling people to buy um and I I&#39;m not saying that for a pat on the back cuz I I don&#39;t get everything right and you you know that I get some right I get some wrong but usually my wrong is just time it takes longer than expected and and sometimes it happens faster than expected uh and I&#39;m wrong on that front like I you know I have these new people that came in first quarter and they&#39;re smiling so wide they they can&#39;t believe I was like listen did this is yes we said this was probably going to happen but you know don&#39;t expect this all the time I mean it&#39;s not going to happen you&#39;re not going to have you know months like this uh uh all the time but the key is knowing the underlying business and uh and the businesses that you own and that&#39;s why great things happen and for out performance anyone who gets linear returns can outperform it&#39;s lumpy and when it happens it happens all at once you can get three four years of returns in a good year uh and and some cases a lot more than that um and then the other years you&#39;re moping along and then boom you just get crushing crushing unbelievably uh outperformance and that gives your irr great things over the three and fiveyear windows which is what everyone really cares about so um so we&#39;re we&#39;re there now so that&#39;s what&#39;s happening and people are surprised and I&#39;m not because I&#39;ve been on here every week with you saying this is going to happen and this is what happens and um and that&#39;s that so uh core inflation we saw the inflation numbers again we talked about you know Doge there are other factors seasonal factors and uh policy factors that are going to offset that European stocks see best start to year since 2000 what was our key theme International outperforms domestic and that&#39;s and what what was the year that we kept pointing to 2 2001 2001 and here we go uh Europe trades at a record discount to the US Okay so we&#39;ve got our gxo which you know is a a show after hours Let&#39;s just call it what it was uh you got three problems s there uh number one uh you got to get the CMA announcement to clear it I&#39;ve never seen a regulator try to regulate a deal after the deal had closed I mean you can&#39;t even make this stuff up a bunch of socialists over in Europe but nonetheless uh we&#39;ll get an announcement on that in the next week they said on the earnings call so we&#39;ll see what happens um and then you got you&#39;re going to need the new CEO announcement is going to be another Catalyst and then from there look the business is doing well they had a couple C take down space but then open up space elsewhere um I like it it&#39;s absolutely fine we didn&#39;t do anything today we&#39;re going to take a few days let it settle out see where it is we added a ton at 42 when it dropped after the deal was called off um uh and we&#39;ll make a determination if we&#39;re going to add more in the next few days we don&#39;t need jerk to anything we we&#39;re not that&#39;s not our that&#39;s not our thing I I&#39;d rather buy it up at 45 next week after the CMA blesses the deal uh then you know uh in the pocket because at the end of the day we got into this thing to be 80 100 100 plus over the next handful of years so we&#39;re not it&#39; be nice to buy some at 30 35 but um we&#39;re going to take our time and and see uh the next few days how it settles out and um go through this stuff with the fine tooth colb because there are enough catalysts in the pipe and uh we want those to be positive catalyst so bank balance sheet holds the largest quantity of commercial mortgages set to mature in 2025 so this is going down everyone was worried about the refinancing wall it&#39;s getting better bottom up consensus we got that we got that hedge fund out clows in the past eight weeks they&#39;ve been selling in the Hole uh they&#39;ve been selling in the last eight weeks it&#39;s usually a contrarian indicator just like they were selling in the hole in 2022 um but I do expect some choppiness over the next two weeks but then again everyone&#39;s expecting that so maybe I&#39;ll be wrong uh the good news is I&#39;m not going to make any buy or sell decisions on seasonal factors about what the general indices do I could care absolutely less that&#39;s why we run our book with very little leverage so we can just sit through the volatility and usually take advantage of that volatility to add to positions that we love like some of the ones that we&#39;ve mentioned Isaac Newton&#39;s nightmare South Sea stock December 1718 to September 21 this is a great uh I had lunch with my friend BV thank you so much uh in the city yesterday and uh his friend Paul and we were talking about some of the shiny object objects out there and things that are people are chasing and fomo jees and um the friend said something like you know they these people think they&#39;re smart I said you&#39;re missing this point the most brilliant people in the world have the same fomo gene as the poorest people in the world it&#39;s just a different mindset some of the greatest entrepreneurs that are on the for 400 act like retail Traders because it&#39;s not what they do what made them wealthy uh the ones that didn&#39;t do it through investing is Massive Action and add and and being non-stop active and interested and taking a lot of bets and a lot of shots on goal and if you do that in investing you just wipe out your account is basically what it comes down to but if you look at Isaac Newton uh one of the smartest people in the world during the south sea bubble he invested a little bit when it started to go up opinion follows Trend he exit he made a nice profit okay like uh uh everyone else and then started to go up against him all of his friends were getting rich so he you know said I did fine I did fine I&#39;m going to just it&#39;s fine but then it kept going up more and his friends kept getting richer so he put all in uh after it was up 8X uh and it went up a little bit more and he probably thought he was a genius went up another 15% uh and then it crashed all the way back down and he lost 90% of his money and died broke so um you have to know history Charles McCay uh Madness of crowds popular delusions and the magic uh and the uh popular delusions and The Madness of crowds that is you know I talk about intelligent investor that&#39;s a basic book you should read that for sure uh that&#39;s a that&#39;s a key one um so when you see these shiny objects going crazy and a lot of people recommending them after they&#39;re up huge uh just do your work just say would I would I take down this whole business at this price at the market is quoting today with my 100% of net worth so if you&#39;re going to buy uh a trading vehicle or an actual business that&#39;s trading at either valuations you can&#39;t justify uh or prices you wouldn&#39;t pay in the private Market just avoid it let them all get rich for a year or two and then in two years when they come ask you for a job because they lost all their money um just uh be humble and gentle because uh it&#39;s human nature is really what it comes down to don&#39;t don&#39;t say I told you so don&#39;t do any of that stuff um just understand it&#39;s the nature of the Beast uh gxo Logistics uh this came out after they reported and the stock went down they upheld their $63 price Target at Morgan Stanley they went through all the numbers uh um yeah and it&#39;ll work its way up there I mean should we have been in the market today I mean we we added a nice chunk at 42 we&#39;re going to see we it&#39;s not a position like Baba which is our largest position where we&#39;re just all in and we were buying like nobody&#39;s business we bought in the hundreds and we bought in the 60s so we have an 83 Blended basis across a little lower now across everything um gxo is not that level of conviction but I think gxo is going to be a nice beautiful double plus over time uh so but we don&#39;t want to get that percentage up too high it&#39;s not it&#39;s not our highest conviction idea like like a baba um but it&#39;s it&#39;s a good business and we want to see who the new CEO is that&#39;s that&#39;s a that&#39;s a key factor I think it&#39;s going to be a good one knowing Brad Jacobs he picks winners um okay here&#39;s from Elon Musk love them or or don&#39;t love him whatever you think it doesn&#39;t matter but what he says here and his stock market predictions haven&#39;t been that accurate in the past but I will say this uh this I think is 100% accurate and he says as it becomes clear that doge is working you will see the long-term treasury bill treasury note yields fall and all Americans will benefit from lower interest payments on mortgages small business debt credit card and other loans um my own addition tied to the longer end of the curve like mortgages Etc so you can see there it&#39;s a little higher than this now up about 50% in you know a month uh on Baba uh semiannual monetary policy report to Congress uh I would say we&#39;re close but not there on inflation same thing so that&#39;s that us profits are surprising by the most in a year we&#39;re going to talk about that earnings growth 16.4% in the quarter uh just over three months ago they were expecting 9% so that&#39;s a positive positive thing US Stocks uh this is at 75y year High versus the rest of the world going back to nifty50 going back to the internet bubble you can see all three standard deviations so you know these are the things you take the other side of and you make generational fortunes I&#39;m not saying short it I&#39;m saying avoid it and and and as that money comes out it&#39;s going to go into the safer uh more predictable durable things auto loan repayments as a share of after tax wages and salaries are at or below 2019 levels for Millennials and gen Z that&#39;s not the headline narrative that you see what else is happening we&#39;ve been talking about China ETF is outperforming the India ETF we said that J Japan and India were just hiding the Asian money that didn&#39;t want to be in China when they were locked into their apartments and sealed into their apartments by the government now that the doors have been broken open the money is going back to China opinion follows Trend India is now near a 52- we low on the IND ETF fxi is now up 50% year onye China versus US tech stocks this is going to converge I think it&#39;s going to be mostly catch up from China Tech versus a catch down from US tech but I think there will be some catch down for sure um uh these all sooner or L later always converge and then in periods like 2021 you get China gets a little outperformance as well same in 2008 and that 2001 to 2007 uh plus period Etc here is high yield credit spreads this is what you want to watch every single day if you&#39;re a nervous Nelly if this starts to spike up then your fears are starting to be a little bit Justified uh but so far so good what do we have here earning surprise again well above the mean of 4.4% be we&#39;re at like 8% earning surpris this week so uh this quarter which is exciting we covered the composite mag 7 volume warning starting off with an intriguing eye-catcher this chart shows the one-year rolling average trading volume in mag seven stocks the concern is that it seems to be doing a similar thing to what it did in late 2021 uh into pandemic stimulus frenzy Peak taken by itself you might dismiss it but there are a few other points to ponder this so you see the volumes are at the the lowest level right before the mag 7 peak in early 20 late 2021 early 2022 sentiment kind of similar too chart patterns kind of similar too doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s going to repeat but if I you know gun to the Head I&#39;d say higher probability of a bit lower than higher is certainly in the near term uh and that&#39;s putting it as diplomatically as I can net 10year returns between nonm mag Mega cap and Mega cap stocks so you could see we&#39;re back to the level uh before we had the huge explosion of small caps from 2000 to 2008 uh massive outperformance and then prior to that this is all cyclical ladies and gentlemen from the Reagan Era 90 1980 to 1985 you saw the same fiveyear massive outperformance I think we&#39;re going to see something similar very shortly uh share of clients expecting the US to be the best performing Global Equity region at the Goldman Sachs Global strategy conference in January of each year the highest wasn&#39;t even close 58% of the room think that us is going to be the worst take the other us us is going to be the best take the other side of that that&#39;s from Goldman Sachs via Mike zardi um I mean you know even in the most bullish years you saw 24 to 32% of the room thought that us would be the outperformer so um it&#39;s just it&#39;s fun how opinion follows Trend small caps are trading at a 22% discount to large caps again you haven&#39;t seen that since 2001 so I continue to reemphasize this because these points if you get them right and you execute properly uh and for clients I&#39;m executing on your behalf um you know these are the times where really special things can happen and um and you&#39;re getting a taste of that already and it hasn&#39;t even begun so fed share Powell says Central Bank doesn&#39;t need to be in a hurry to lower interest rates far covered that break even rate is up this is going to come down similar to the first quarter of last year it spikes first quarter of the year before it spikes and then it comes down for the rest of the year Alibaba dramatically outperforming if you remember uh over the months I said that when the H sang goes uh alibaba&#39;s going to at least double the performance of the hangsang that&#39;s already happening you can see here uh forget forget the hang it&#39;s already two and 3X outperforming but even the hangang tech it&#39;s 2X outperforming and uh beginning of great things to come after we just confuse people for the next two months is my guess I&#39;m perfectly happy with it continuing to go straight straight up parabolic but uh I&#39;ve also been around long enough to expect a consolidation uh Consumer Staples no one wanted them now they&#39;re starting to go so get some of the laggards uh this is very important and this is something that we&#39;re the only ones really talking about uh and have been continually talking about is to watch certainly high yield credit spreads but watch the jgbs because as those rates go up the carry trade is unwinding and all that free carry trade money was in mag 7 and it is just uh bleeding out and it&#39;s going to continue to bleed out as their inflation numbers stay up and as the bank of Japan hikes rates uh the carry trade will unwind which means the mag mag 7 is going to lose that marginal bid just like like Orange County real estate uh so uh that&#39;s that City economic surprise index um turning down a little bit so keep an eye on that doesn&#39;t you know it is what it is uh forward earnings are edging higher so there&#39;s a lot of stuff here and this is like 10% of what we look at to kind of draw our conclusions in terms of General framework and then we&#39;d like to look at individual businesses very comprehensively um businesses that we&#39;d be willing to put 100% of our net worth if JP Morgan was going to finance the rest uh for to Own 100% of the business in the private market and uh if you&#39;re telling me that you would buy some of these fomo stocks with 100% of your net worth trading at you know 50 time sales or whatever they&#39;re trading at um Good Luck you might be right maybe earnings will catch up but history has shown that that the odds are against you but not impossible um I prefer to to make bets that I can sleep soundly at night when the odds are with me and do it over some non-correlated bets so if one doesn&#39;t work because of what I don&#39;t know that I don&#39;t know the rest well more than make up for it and meet my irr targets uh nickel back cost of making American coins this is mindboggling cost 3.69 cents to make a 1-cent penny 13.78 cents to make a 5-cent nickel and then only at the dime do you start to get uh a good spread but I don&#39;t see how this makes sense moving forward so we&#39;ll see what Trump has to do about that buyback and dividend yields you can see the buyback yield is uh it&#39;s interesting it&#39;s negative on the Emerging Markets I think this is going to flip now when you&#39;re seeing with the Chinese companies and uh start to really add an additional level of returns to Emerging Markets bottom up consensus expect an hour we covered that okay non-farm payrolls that was Friday consumer credit people are worried about consumer credit people borrowing a lot you you have to worry about this when it starts going down when it starts going down you&#39;re getting a recession uh when it&#39;s going up it&#39;s it&#39;s okay for now if it stays up in that neighborhood it should be fine china consumer inflation picks up as holiday boosts spending uh people have been saying China&#39;s in never ending deflation it will never get out of deflation it&#39;s just not showing up that way anymore which is good um Europe at a record discount to the US you can see the multiples here 22 versus uh 14 times versus emerging markets at 12 times you tell me China CPI you can see the data here core CPI that&#39;s sign of health and positivity the a aaii sentiment survey today 47% of retail investors got bearish which is kind of interesting that&#39;s usually not where you want to be a seller but we&#39;re looking at this next two weeks of seasonal weakness uh that a lot of people are looking for weakness and usually when everyone&#39;s looking for the same thing maybe it doesn&#39;t happen but uh it&#39;s interesting to see so much bearishness all of the sudden from retail investors H just note it it&#39;s just another data point none of these are foolproof data points but in aggregate so this was kind of the big thing with gxo the guidance was only 240 to 260 in terms of uh earnings per share for next year which was a little lighter than 280 uh organic Revenue growth is going to be fine we&#39;ll do this one in detail next week uh we want to spend some more time on it on balance it was fine I&#39;d like to see more free cash flow but they&#39;re you know largely free cash flow positive 250 million of free cash flow so they have all the runway to turn it around it&#39;s a duopoly it&#39;s a European exposed business which is what I want right now it meets all the things you got Brad Jacobs as chairman he&#39;ll figure it out he&#39;s got a lot on his plate these days um and uh so we&#39;ll just hold it and that that&#39;s that if it underperforms for 6 months so be it when it catches up it&#39;ll be a double or triple so uh we&#39;re okay with this but we want to see a couple of these Catalyst the CEO and the CMA get ironed out in the coming weeks and months uh equal weight versus aggregate S&amp;P 500 annualized 10year returns from 1970 to 2024 another way to look at it equal weight has beat cap weighted index 78% of the 10-year periods so what we&#39;re in right now because of Zer is the exception not the rule continue to bet on the exception and face the consequences uh here&#39;s the capb backs that&#39;s that people are thinking that&#39;s a great thing that&#39;s a margin eroder and a buyback murderer there will be much less BuyBacks with this amount of defensive cap backs share of sales derived from outside the US uh that&#39;s mag seven so they&#39;re going to get hit this first quarter because the dollar has been strong they&#39;ll catch a Tailwind in the second half when the dollar comes down but now they&#39;re going to get hit the most because they have the most sales outside the US so you&#39;ll see that in Q2 earning q1 earnings reported during Q2 uh here&#39;s the flow of funds tends to Peak right around now and then that&#39;s why you get a week second half we&#39;ll see if that&#39;s the case this year second half of February um Q4 earnings growth is actually more than 16.4 uh Goldman Sachs say 17.1 so a lot of good things happening here and uh you can see where a lot of the growth is coming materials is still a quarter away from really turning the corner but um healthc care is starting to come up uh financials consumer discretionary Technology&#39;s come down from last year quite a bit from you know uh cyclicals so cyclicals that&#39;s pretty impressive 17.6% earnings growth for Q4 uh okay again fxi versus IND Dy China versus India ratio chart starting to break out from uh Allstar charts and that&#39;s that for the data so you can see it&#39;s emphasizing a lot of the same points but as you see them playing out when we were kind of the only ones talking about them months ago um you can see why it makes sense to pay attention to these longer term patterns over time here&#39;s CPS um so the thing that is the stock will probably sell off tomorrow I thought I was amazed by the free cash flow uh in the quarter so they did 63.2 million I thought they&#39;d be cash flow positive but I didn&#39;t think it would be this cash flow positive cash provided by operations 74 million uh that&#39;s just absolutely amazing um but it&#39;s you know it&#39;s Q4 and that includes the impact of some of the discontinued uh divisions so on balance uh this was a good report where the the problem is going to be is that uh while they&#39;re guiding $0 to $235 million of adjusted eida um their North American light vehicle production assumptions are very low so remember we [Music] need everything above 15.7 uh is where we start to just mint money where all the fixed costs are paid and like every 200,000 300,000 cars is $3 a share of earnings up to $3 a share of earnings if they don&#39;t add cost back which they say they don&#39;t have to uh they&#39;ll have to add some but let&#39;s just say it&#39;s $2 a share in earnings you get back to a normal peak level of 17.1 million uh cars couple years out you&#39;re looking at $10 plus per year in earnings why does that matter is because the last peak in 2017 was $719 in earnings and the stock traded up to 146 so um I think you have a couple of things going number one the oem&#39;s margins are going to get smoked because of tariffs and nonsense going on and they overcharged during covid Etc uh so they have to be humble about their guidance because they&#39;re going to be going into negotiations on price um and that&#39;s number one and number two I think we&#39;re going to find that these numbers these industry assumptions which they have no control over the things that they do have control over they&#39;re doing well things they don&#39;t have control over um you know if that&#39;s true 15.1 it&#39;s going to be probably a cash flow Break Even or slight slightly positive year if it comes in at 16 because what&#39;s happening is we&#39;re going to do a lot more volume from a lot more incentives at a lot lower margins for the oems um and that&#39;s the trend for younger people buying cars they&#39;re buying smaller and they&#39;re buying cheaper uh and then maybe you get a Tailwind on on uh car loan rates Etc we don&#39;t know but smaller same with the houses you could wind up doing 16 and then this thing just Banks coin and it&#39;s it&#39;s Off to the Races and uh the other things so this is one that we will definitely look at uh in the next week we&#39;ll see what they have to say on the call tomorrow but this the the part about their guidance that is not ideal is their industry assumptions about how many cars the oems are going to produce but those are always conservative uh and I think that&#39;s going to be proven to be incorrect as uh inventories have to go up as incentives go up and as size of the car goes down which hurts the oems because it hurts their margins but it helps the arms dealers which is the auto part suppliers that have to supply more and more units uh to support the oems value stocks are out earning forecast there you go consumer borrowing surges to 40 we covered that Japan&#39;s households spending massively beats expectations boosting

overweight which we are uh but he&#39;s gone uh uh cowboy on that so good for him uh The Magnificent Seven companies just did something that haven&#39;t I mean notionally with our option exposure we probably have way more exposure on a relative basis than he has but we we have uh dramatically less downside than he does so that&#39;s that&#39;s another interesting thing which is huge the way we structure for clients some of the long dated out of the money spreads uh that we made so much money on in October and we&#39;re going to do again in 2025 um kind of you know as as heavy weight as we are in stock which is nice for the portfolio the real juice and Alpha comes from our special sauce in that regard and um uh our notional like if you added up the amount of stock it represents it&#39;s it&#39;s uh it&#39;s super exciting and then our downside relative to that risk is so low uh and and Quantified which is super asymmetry is the name of the game uh analysts expect China property Market recovery in 2025 after seeing Improvement in January uh opinion follows Trend China consumer inflation picks up as holiday boost spending alibaba&#39;s clouds quen 2.5 Max secures top rankings

these these Legacy businesses with the distribution in in place they figure it out they figure out what the customer wants and then they just jam it through the pipes and uh they figure it out so you if you buy them and when they&#39;re out of favor and you got to wait a year or two for them to figure it out you make your doubles and triples and move on Amazon and alphabet CEOs plan big stock sales uh surprise surprise uh it&#39;s not a great indicator but it&#39;s just something to note given everything else we&#39;ve talk talked about Chinese investors Drive Hong Kong rally with 19 billion inflow tomorrow&#39;s newspaper today ladies and gentlemen Europe&#39;s UNL stocks are suddenly on top of the world Boeing to cut fewer Moon rocket jobs after daily NASA talks us tariffs will weaken dollar if Nation Strike Back Bank of America says they&#39;re already doing that ai&#39;s partnership with Alibaba excites Chinese iOS developers ahead of conference uh that was the big news this week obviously is that apple is going to use alibaba&#39;s uh AI across all their devices in China that&#39;s huge because now it becomes the gold standard over there and everything else falls to the Wayside uh with deep seek China moves to take on nvidia&#39;s Cuda ecosystem so you know Nvidia tried to do what Apple did we talked about this and we said the government&#39;s not going to let them build the wal Garden that they let happen with the Apple App Store under their nose that&#39;s not going to happen well now the private Market is taking that and um uh used to be you could you know you really needed to use Nvidia software to develop these models uh deep seek turned that on its head so did Alibaba Quinn uh Etc so Wall Street U UBS to see upside for Chinese AI stocks with rally at less than halfway mark I mean these are the same people who were negative in the whole now they say it&#39;s going to double again uh I think they&#39;re being conservative Japan soft Bank swings to a loss ahead of big AI infrastructure bet on Stargate project you know here&#39;s the cowboy coming in saying I got $200 billion and you know this is a guy who blew up shareholders with we we we work uh and uh sold Alibaba in the hole at70 $60 we probably bought a lot of his shares uh and now uh says uh he&#39;s going to give $200 billion for this and you know he has a a $2.4 billion loss in the in the quarter uh he&#39;ll figure it out because he&#39;s like a cat with n Nine Lives some people just have that luck but um good luck I wouldn&#39;t bet on it at some point these guys hit a wall Alibaba shares surged to the highest since 2022 on AI rally Alibaba pairs with apple to develop AI features okay billionaire David terer boosts China Stak to 37% our notional is way higher than that but our actual real money is way lower which I which I love the asymmetry because uh we can get many multiples of The Upside with a third of the risk uh is Intel now a trump stock its shares surge after upbeat comments by JD Vance this was yesterday and then they followed through today stocks up to 2425 just getting started in r view Powell tells Congress fed still in no rush to lower rates Walt Disney Cuts diversity category from executive pay scheme when we were pounding the table on the podcast to buy Disney in the 80s and 90s uh everyone would I would get all these texts and emails and nonsense saying you know go woke go broke and uh I don&#39;t I never invest on the basis of politics one way or another I invest on the basis of cash generation and there&#39;s some of that that probably hurt them and and hurt sentiment and everything else but that&#39;s uh those days are in the rearview mirror for those who act who you know uh think that&#39;s important to investing uh There You Go China land sales show property Market stabilizing Chinese Tech stock slide as strong rally Spurs profit taking so this is what you see on a day-to-day they&#39;re all waiting for this so when it pulls back to 103 or 11 110 uh I can&#39;t wait to see the headlines from Bloomberg and from my favorite lady over at Barons who&#39;s been awfully quiet during this 50% rally in Alibaba so she was super negative every day for two years under a hundred bucks and now that the Stock&#39;s up 50% uh she&#39;s nowhere to be heard and uh they have uh new right ERS talking about it but when it pulls back to 112 she&#39;ll be back and she&#39;ll be saying see another fake out blah blah blah and there&#39;s your contrarian indicator Intel stock is on a run not seen in more than two decades uh three-day rally fueled by hospitable political climate and analyst commentary about its CPU business I said this a couple weeks ago when deep seek was out deep seek could generate similar type of performance with inferior chips and I said who is the king of inferior chips in the world the king of inferior chips is Intel and it&#39;s priced like it doesn&#39;t even have chips so uh here&#39;s what you&#39;re seeing again opinion follows friend and here&#39;s jeffy&#39;s analyst Blain Curtis getting bullish after it&#39;s had a 25% move uh power moves and power tools stock market and sentiment results we simply covered uh in detail the Alibaba news I would read this article by the way um showing the double out performance of Alibaba relative to the index and then talking about all the analysts getting excited and the reasons why they&#39;re super excited right now whether it&#39;s the cloud growth whether it&#39;s the AI partnership and now they&#39;re paying attention to it being undervalued still trading at only 12.2 times forward earnings uh no not 12.2 times sales 12.2 times forward earnings ladies and gentlemen uh and uh and maybe maybe we&#39;ll get uh they&#39;ll take guidance down to half a penny and that&#39;ll get the stock down to 110 uh and then the multiple will be down to 12 and people will say see and then at 200 they&#39;ll be buying it Handover fist just like Mr Isaac Newton with the south sea bubble uh selling at the wrong time and buying at the wrong time not because he was dumb he was one of the it&#39;s not the smartest people person in the world at the time but because it&#39;s a different skill set and um uh that&#39;s all I can say um there&#39;s gener same thing you can see free cash flow recovery stock you know under 100 no one wanted it we were table Pounders at 200 or 190 everyone wanted it now it fell back down to 150 no one wants it bottom line is the cash flow is recovering to record highs and it just printed record high free cash flow penetration rate is low um disruptions from weather and demand on the grid are going up not down and rates will slowly come down and and new houses will slowly go up uh and this will be a monster beneficiary the big two by the way the title of this and and Jeff did an incredible job uh should have been um two best levered plays on housing recovery I was looking at some home builders today and they&#39;re down a lot but they they&#39;ve been up a lot so I I wouldn&#39;t I wouldn&#39;t really get excited about buying home builders in the hole yet I think they probably have some more pain and as the numbers start to improve I think the price is still going to go lower for for the home builders just like you saw with Alibaba uh but I think these are the two best ways to play a housing recovery massive units smaller size units smaller footprint uh is going to be Stanley Black and&amp; Decker and gener I I think are going to be huge so you can read all the reasons why here and then you could also read same thing with Stanley Black and&amp; Decker destock to restock uh just waiting for the housing units and this will be Off to the Races construction Etc but free cash flow you&#39;ve got Runway this is all you need all you need is Runway price is going to be priced it&#39;s going to hover around between 80 and 110 and then the game is going to be on and the thing&#39;s going to go straight back to New highs and it&#39;s going to take a few years and your irr is going to be you know 30 31% on the investment and it all came in the last six months uh and people be like oh yeah that that happened um uh actually you know it&#39;s funny I only hear things before they work after they work it&#39;s crickets it&#39;s unbelievable when uh Alibaba was down and I&#39;d post something about Alibaba I&#39;d get like 400 you know likes and now that it&#39;s like gone up 50% everyone&#39;s crickets why because they sold in the hole they got tired of it they got pushed out of it at the exact wrong time they couldn&#39;t hold on and now they hate that it&#39;s up so big so you know maybe they&#39;ll buy some at 110 or whatever when they could have bought at 70 but that is human nature um except for the people listening to this podcast uh who are awesome and uh are learning some of these tricks of the trade and doing great and I also hear great things from them as well so uh so here&#39;s the existing home sales this is a great chart that Jeff included and it just shows we&#39;re kind of just getting started here for the next cycle houses are going to be smaller units are going to pick back up and gener and Stanley are going to be huge massive levered plays and they have all the runway so if it takes if it starts right away if it takes a year if it takes two years as long as you have free cash flow on the Bal she it&#39;s okay you just waited out and when it happens it happens all at once he did a chart on eida uh we don&#39;t talk about eida on this conference call so uh let&#39;s ni that moving forward but uh uh the concept is the same uh with free cash flow you&#39;re seeing the recovery and I like the theme uh Intel so he covered that you can see the price down because the business is down again next Catalyst for them just like gxo new CEO we got a little bit of policy tail wi maybe we&#39;ll get a little policy Tailwind on gxo as far as Cooper standard uh I like buying on the weakness here because I think the industry numbers are too low and I think management is also going to be conservative or negative on the call tomorrow because the oem&#39;s quarters were crap in terms of profitability great in terms of units uh so they don&#39;t want to say hey we&#39;re making all this money while you know GM and Ford and uh Stanis are cutting costs and laying off people because they paid too much to the union so um so that&#39;s that that&#39;ll create another opportunity particularly for new people to finally get a realsize position uh will be great you know many of you listening to this have Bas SE in the $5 when we started buying in March of 2022 and um and eight and eight and $9 across everything uh so hopefully we can get a bunch at you know 12 or 11 or 13 it&#39;s going to depend on tomorrow&#39;s call and liquidity but it&#39;s all noise this cycle repeats itself every 5 to 7 years and we&#39;ll get the ussar and they will mint money uh Vance also mentioned other touchstones of the Trump Administration saying that quote to safeguard America&#39;s Advantage it will ensure that the most powerful AI systems are built in the US with American designed and manufactured chips well the only player in town yeah they can bring tsmc over here and they will but the only player in town is Intel and they got to make Intel work uh and that&#39;s how it&#39;s going to be maybe they&#39;ll put 50% of the equity in The Sovereign wealth fund but if they make this thing work it&#39;s going to have a US Monopoly is really what it&#39;s going to come down to because Trump&#39;s going to push them to do all their orders through Intel particularly if the Sovereign wealth fund and the taxpayers hold it I I don&#39;t I can&#39;t tell you whether this Sovereign wealth fund is going to happen or not it doesn&#39;t wreak of proper capitalism but uh I wouldn&#39;t be surprised so there you go and you can read through all this great detail uh that was highlighted for you again CNN fear and greed is is is fearful it&#39;s kind of neutral here uh not an area where I want to buy everything or sell everything to be honest with you I&#39;m just paying attention to the seasonality NASDAQ top 30 wor weights earnings estimates in the last 60 days down 19 basis points so basically flat uh Dow same thing top 30 weights uh up for next year 55 bips down for this year 71 bip so again flattish uh here was was 16.4 that was last Friday said we&#39;re at 17.1 thing I want to keep an eye on is the seasonal the seasonal tendency is that guidance comes down in the first quarter every year and we are in fact seeing that you know down from we were basically at 275 all year and we&#39;re now down to 272 interestingly enough uh 2024 is finishing up much better than I anticipated so don&#39;t be surprised by a hockey stick in the back half getting back up over 275 280 that&#39;s earnings uh we talked the PPI was better than the CPI but again seasonally this has happened every January and some February is in the last few years so don&#39;t make too much of it yet particularly with all the people that are getting laid off with Doge and let&#39;s get down to the ask me anything questions for those of you who uh get value from the ask me anything questions stick around for those of you just like the podcast we kept it uh here to a reasonable amount of time we&#39;ll see you next week same time same place so question number one comes from uh JT investor he&#39;s asking about the guidance with CPS we covered that uh and that&#39;s just a function of the things that they don&#39;t control which is industry volumes which I think are way too low as they have been fa set says over the last five weeks that q1 earnings and revenue are trending down uh da da da so that&#39;s normal guidance comes down the first quarter we covered that last week it seems gxo won&#39;t reach its 2027 goals uh yeah they organic growth uh low single digit versus double digit does this change your view on the company no it just extends it so it&#39;s going to hurt my irr in the short term unless they get a great CEO and they get the CMA thing improved uh it&#39;s just going to take a little longer which will give me an opportunity to probably build the position a little bit more uh but we&#39;re not doing anything yet and haven&#39;t decided whether we are we&#39;re comfortable with our position uh as as it stands Henry bashari wanted to say thank you your framework has given me a guide on how to handle my emotions I used to panic I used to panic when positions fall but now I know that as long as I&#39;ve read through the noise and I know I what I need to do appreciate your teachings and wish you all the best in life thank you Henry that&#39;s very kind um Brian Norman uh are you backing up the truck on gxo no not yet I made it that may may change tomorrow but uh I&#39;m comfortable with the position and just because something happens to a stock you know most people the stock beats earnings and the stock goes up and everyone has to chase it up and some and sometimes it keeps continuing and sometimes it complete fake out and then Ju Just the Same it goes down usually you want to wait three days anyway number one to take some time and think about it um I mean if if they had the best quarter ever and it went to 50 would I would I be buying more and the answer is no so um because my basis is a lot lower so uh I&#39;m G to wait for it to settle out I&#39;m going to do some more work on it over the weekend uh and I&#39;m perfectly comfortable doing nothing and letting it go lower before it goes higher or letting it go higher and I missed the day to add a few shares it doesn&#39;t doesn&#39;t really make a difference to me it&#39;s not the highest conviction idea in the portfolio and um I mean if you saw how much I was buying in one day when Baba hit 58 that one day and the high 60s that would blow your mind all right here&#39;s a question from Warren Buffett uh you guys can verify if this is a correct uh uh authentic email address it says warren. buffett. 3@gmail.com hello Tom thank you for all the great time in your show even at my age I am still spying on your tips check this out uh for me my eyeballs are getting tired uh are Archer Daniel Midland and FMC corporation uh thanks Warren okay Warren let&#39;s see uh I&#39;m not the guy to be giving you advice but you could ask your son about Archer Daniel mid Archer Daniel&#39;s Midland because a he&#39;s a farmer and B I think he&#39;s still on the board uh We&#39;ve covered this one a lot I do like it uh I&#39;ve got it on alert if it gets down to 40 I&#39;ll probably start to buy it you say well what&#39;s the difference why not just start buying at 45 and the answer is we don&#39;t really have room for it right now and there&#39;s nothing I&#39;m willing to sell to make room for it uh but yeah I got my eye on it but let me just take a look at the financials cuz I think we did this one and I wasn&#39;t that excited yeah free cash flow had been going down revenues had been going down so I&#39;d have to listen to a bunch of calls uh and find out what the turnaround plan is but yeah you&#39;re seeing this across all the a space FMC this again this is why there&#39;s always something for us to do I know we&#39;ve been pounding the table about the window for the dstock restock cycle is closing and a lot of those names have run uh or are running um but there&#39;s always stuff to do FMC similar type of thing uh I like both of these but we&#39;re not buying them yet but we would uh definitely want to be doing work on um both of them for sure because when they turn they turn hard they&#39;re cyclical businesses they&#39;re not really own forever businesses but this one is turning around uh FMC we got to see a revenue start to turn around and understand why it got hit so bad but you&#39;re seeing it Company by company so uh yeah I definitely like this space uh thank you Warren for your great ideas and and by the way for changing my life uh even though you&#39;re not the real Warren Buffett uh Mitch Lim um is there an opinion on Twitter stating that the positive correlation between HSI and HSI volatility index means that us hedge funds are likely manipulating the market Mitch this is the biggest amount of bullshittery just for get it what does that have to do with the amount of cash that Alibaba is going to generate over the next 5 years being the leader in AI the leader in Cloud uh complete toll taker on the recovery of the middle class stop wasting your time reading that is completely useless to making money but thank you for the beautiful question because I&#39;m sure that helped a lot of people and thank you for being a great listener uh Chris Williamson uh take a look at ACH good medical device opportunity here inflecting on profitability could be a strong year for them let&#39;s take a look uh this thing has really negative free cash flow this is a no no for us because they don&#39;t have the runway so I&#39;m going to pass and I&#39;ll take a look if you want to ask again in a couple of you know next if they start to print some free cash flow then let me know uh actually let me take a look at the quarterly here even though I I don&#39;t really love looking at quarterly oh what happened here anyway it it&#39;s not it&#39;s not for me right now but uh I&#39;ll keep an open mind thoughts on Pepsi we&#39;ve covered this a few times uh Staples the whole thing I like the protein plays like horal I think this one&#39;s okay I wouldn&#39;t get excited about owning it but um I know the gp1s ETC that&#39;s why I like the protein plays dividend Aristocrat I you know I&#39;d probably be interested around 135 I&#39;d take a a close look you don&#39;t get too many chances to buy this business like this so yeah I think it&#39;s it&#39;s almost time I think it&#39;s a little early and um but I like I generally like the idea but there are some different headwinds that didn&#39;t exist so you got to be open-minded and that&#39;s why I need the price to be a lot lower like Diago on that basis uh what do you think about vistory group British homeb Builder 40% return on Capital employed 10 times earnings uh I don&#39;t know the British housing market well enough but let&#39;s take a look vistory group I do want more exposure to the UK than just gxo yeah I would listen to the call I did see some stuff about UK housing that wasn&#39;t good this week but uh let&#39;s see what this looks like here vty y.l yeah I mean this is going to be similar to the US home buildings it&#39;s just going to take a few years probably a year or two to bottom out or even more but I I think you&#39;re early and I think you&#39;re right um but I think you&#39;re going to have other opportunities let me just take a quick look at the uh financials and see if it&#39;s worth just putting in a flyer now and just waiting through the next year year and a half so it looks like they did some Acquisitions what&#39;s this negative free cash flow last year wait I guess they didn&#39;t report 2024 yet let&#39;s take a look at quarterly yeah it seems like it&#39;s turning the corner I would do I would do some more work on that I think that&#39;s kind of interesting it&#39;s always been a pretty lowquality business that tends to be the case with home builders um income statement yeah they&#39;re buying in wait a second no they&#39;re deluding they did they deluded shareholders by a lot probably for that deal I don&#39;t love it i&#39; I&#39;d probably take a few minutes to look at it more carefully but uh I think you got time and I think it&#39;s a good find um so let&#39;s go there all right Don L Este Lauder has two share classes and there is no direct way to influence the company as the family has majority voting rights what are your thoughts on this class structure I love it when it&#39;s family-owned just like Walmart was when they were in the dumps because they didn&#39;t have their internet strategy the families fix it and they fix it quickly I love that um the other thing too um you have to keep in mind is go ask your 10 and 12 yearold nieces or daughters everyone thinks that Estee louder first off Estee louder is basically a China recovery play um and I think it&#39;s the recovery is going to be fantastic but um even you know most people think in the US that it&#39;s just a bunch of old ladies that are dying off and um it&#39;s never going to come back when I talk to the makeup people uh at Fox they&#39;re just like they own so many great Brands I mean if you ask your young kids they&#39;ll talk to about Dr jart plus they&#39;ll talk to you about um I think lab series uh and I think the ordinary and I think two- faced Origins you know you got Mac um so they&#39;re going to figure it out they&#39;ve been trading brand portfolio Brands just like VF Corp for over a century and family-owned businesses the beauty of them owning 38% of the company is that they&#39;ve got a lot more to lose than we do if they lose they lose everything if if we lose we our two things when we buy a company are number one is if this position were to go to zero because there could always be something that you don&#39;t know that you don&#39;t know and if you think otherwise uh you&#39;re not being rational uh would they take us out on a stretcher and the answer is always no it could go to zero and we&#39;d be fine and we&#39;d be able to outperform over a reasonable amount of time from from the remaining companies in the portfolio that&#39;s number one um they can if they lose this the you know chances are fourth fifth generation they can&#39;t go out and try out for the Mets uh and make a living so they&#39;re going to make sure they have the right people in to turn it around you got a new CEO that just did the kitchen syn quarter which is why um uh why it was down a little bit which happens every kitchen syn quarter with the new CEO first quarter Etc so uh I&#39;m not worried about that I&#39;m pretty confident in China and that&#39;s really the whole trade there um and it&#39;s a smaller position obviously our highest conviction China is Baba could you take a look at ymm full truck Alliance I don&#39;t buy smaller Chinese companies because I operate under the assumption I&#39;m not willing to take company and uh country risk um and so this probably works as a trade but it&#39;s too small too unknown too unproven for me probably works but I&#39;m more than willing to miss it my general premise with Baba was always that if go if Baba goes so does China so um I don&#39;t have any worries about fraud or much less than I would with something like full truck Alliance I know the company I know the numbers it&#39;s it&#39;s fine on paper but you can&#39;t trust the paper that&#39;s the problem so I&#39;ll leave it at that pzza we cover this pretty much every week and I every week I basically say me don&#39;t love it it&#39;ll probably work and my answer this week is probably going to be the exact same thing so starting to move uh probably take a little bit longer so you probably be able to buy it at 45 if you really love it I think that uh I don&#39;t love this trend of cash flow rolling back over but I think it&#39;s probably priced in enough um but I&#39;ve continued to say eh it&#39;s it&#39;s uh it&#39;s okay Brian Wilson do you think Trump&#39;s executive order revoking electronic vehicle electric vehicle mandate will have any negative impact on Alum yes that&#39;s why the stock&#39;s down everyone knew that that&#39;s not news so uh the whole story here is 40 million Global stock to 120 million by 2027 all driven by CH China fake subsidies and um the normal cyclicality of the lithium business them being the top producer with three and a half billion dollar liquidity Runway to wait for the cycle to turn and it will they&#39;ve all cut production and it will come back so uh there you go Lucas Bergman uh any semiconductor picks besides Intel no uh Mao boss ofart met Cole I&#39;ve seen a lot of people do that and uh lose a lot of money so I would say this is an example of like yeah of course Trump doesn&#39;t care you know like he wants all energy which is true but if you bet that way he got smoked in his first uh which one are you talking about Alpha metallurgical all these things just restructure every few years go bankrupt flush the shareholders come back out go straight up everyone thinks that they great businesses Alpha metallurgical I don&#39;t even know I like the contrarian thinking but I I don&#39;t want to play there it&#39;s a it&#39;s a trade let&#39;s see here AMR so it&#39;s up 125x and now it&#39;s pulled back 50% and you want to buy it here uh I think we covered this one before it looks familiar so the answer is no and then J apt what is your process to get DG he&#39;s asking about um we&#39;re not doing anything with DG but we&#39;re keeping our eye on Dollar General for sure these have been Smoked by teu if that Dom Minimus comes back I think this and Dollar Tree and everything else are going to be pretty good opportunities uh yeah they&#39;ll shut down a lot of stores um you got to get a sense of solvency risk but I think they&#39;ve got enough assets that they can sell off and cash flow let&#39;s take a look at the balance sheet f million cash six billion of debt so they&#39;ll probably have to close a bunch of stores I mean this is a levered play so you really got to keep your eye on um on free cash flow because that&#39;s going to be your Runway and even through all this looks okay they&#39;re going to you know it&#39;s it&#39;s just you know the issue with this one is that it&#39;s basically the same play as Advanced Auto Parts and I like Advanced Auto Parts better and I like the guy turning it around better so I don&#39;t need two of the the same thing it&#39;s basically uh retailing to lower end and uh I just think the necessity uh of what Advanced Auto Part sells and the areas where they control the market is a much better moat than you know selling cheap candy to people who shouldn&#39;t you know to whatever it&#39;s just not as good of a business but I like the idea can you take a look at Ashland okay cash flows turning down with price so you got to get some comfort I don&#39;t see revenues recovering yet margins have been choppy uh let&#39;s take a look at the balance sheet 300 million of cash 1.35 billion of debt they did have a pop of free cash flow how&#39;s that doing on a quarterly basis has always been a pretty low quality business let me just see here um specialty ingredients should special yeah all these are Dam like International fragrances and flavor uh darling what is this Sal tablet binders nutrition Solutions thickeners stabilizers [Music] emulsifiers I think if it gets into low 50 starts to do some more work but uh let me just see something here anal uh Financial income statement see what they&#39;re doing to the share count all right so they&#39;re not increasing the share count it seems like a cyclical business yeah it&#39;s probably getting close to okay uh I&#39;d need to do a lot more work and listen to management and understand that but like if you can buy this at 50% off uh which is not there yet it&#39;s probably kind of interesting uh but it&#39;s not a great business so it&#39;s more of a trade which is why I&#39;m I&#39;m a pass um Alex Evolution AB we cover this one very often uh I don&#39;t like this casino gambling business it&#39;s just too unpredictable uh this is online they can go when they go they go Yep this is we&#39;ll take a quick look at it Evolution AB yeah I mean everything looks great on this type of business until it doesn&#39;t and I&#39;ve seen these Cycles come and go so maybe this one&#39;s different but you got to tell me why and that takes a lot more work than doing a few minutes here um yeah I think this is more of a trait I think a lot of the juice is out of this lemon but uh you could definitely get a spike up to you know 13 or something like that but uh it&#39;s not for me all right Jimmy Jones again uh to share delution bother you on intel if they do it at a low price yes of course it bothers me but if they stay in business they will be able to start to generate cash and buy in shares and they will stay in business so that&#39;s a risk uh but um I think a lot of that is actually priced in uh know you I&#39;m not sure if you smoke but I got a potential cigar butt trade for you don&#39;t smoke kave but um let&#39;s see g p r o yeah I know there&#39;s a big name in this uh I I never like no not for me pass good luck with uh smoking causes cancer so just beware Zen Jason Zen uh not seeing what Bill Amman is seeing in Uber now that he&#39;s taking a 1% position in the company uh it&#39;s not what we do I&#39;ll leave that one to Mr Amman but um I mean you really have to obviously dar&#39;s done a good job running the business um you have to have some view on what&#39;s going to happen with autonomous and how it&#39;s going to impact them and This falls into the predict the future category which uh on the one hand is possible but it&#39;s not probable and I think things are going to change so much in this space so he&#39;s kind of got double exposure to autonomous between his position in Google and his position in um in Uber um I don&#39;t I don&#39;t see anything wrong with it but I don&#39;t want to own it it&#39;s just outside of the lane of our our lane of competence and what we do well so um I&#39;d be way more interested when I was at 2530 than I am right now um doesn&#39;t mean it doesn&#39;t go to 200 but it can do so without us and I&#39;ll leave it at that um Elliot okay so with that said I want to thank everyone for tuning in we&#39;ll be back next week same time same place in the meantime make it a great one bye for now [Music] oh oh [Music] [Music]
