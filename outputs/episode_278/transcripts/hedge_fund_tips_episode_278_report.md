- Broadening market leadership beyond Mag 7
- International outperformance, especially China
- Deflationary forces leading to lower bond yields
- Cyclical opportunities in small caps and emerging markets

## Macro Thesis & Key Data Points
The market is undergoing a shift from growth to value, with international equities outperforming US equities. Deflationary forces are emerging, which will lead to lower bond yields. Small caps and emerging markets are poised to outperform. The marginal Chinese buyer is going to be less incentivized to get money out of China in the next year or two when everything is going up.

|-----------|-------|----------------------|
| European Earnings Forecasts | Rising | Confirms the shift towards international outperformance. |
| US Stocks vs Rest of World | 75-year High | Indicates an extreme, suggesting a potential reversal and opportunity in international markets. |
| Small Caps vs Large Caps | 22% Discount | Presents a generational buying opportunity in small caps. |
| China Consumer Inflation | Picking Up | Counters the narrative of never-ending deflation in China. |
| Europe vs US Multiples | Europe at Record Discount | Further supports the thesis of international outperformance. |
