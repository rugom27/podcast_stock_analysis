Welcome to Hedge Fund Tips with Tom Hayes. I'm Tom Hayes and this is your 311th videocast podcast for the week ending October 2nd, 2025. We have so much to cover this week. It was a barn burner of a trip. 11 days in New York and Connecticut. Non-stop action. Let's get down to it. Family first. We'll get you updated on everything. Uh, first I want to actually do family first. Let's cover a couple goals that are more important. Uh, this first one here, that's a goal from Mimi. Super exciting. And then we got one here from Annabelle. [Applause] [Music] All right. Love that. Uh, and then I had the pleasure of meeting uh, Gary Player on Monday and uh, there was a sand lesson and a regular lesson and then we played 18 and the whole thing. It was just incredible. But I had to cut out this one little clip from it. By the way, any of you who want the sand lesson or the uh um uh the golf lesson, I've recorded it. If you're a client, just, you know, text or call uh just call me or email and I'll I'll get get you the link. But this was it just goes to show what a class act this guy is. You got to you got to listen to this and just turn up the volume. I can't get it any louder. Here we go. >> Admire you, Gary. You know, >> the greatest gift bestowed upon mankind is adversity. I suffered like a junkyard dog as a young boy. Like a junkyard dog. And that's why I became world champion. That's why I won the most tournaments in the world today because I never choked. I remembered what it was like. And I remembered to be have gratitude in your heart. And I never forgot that you're in the greatest country that God ever made, the United States of America, and the opportunities that you have. And that makes you appreciate things, which is so important. But I'll tell you something a little quite interesting. If you took the average boy of 17 in Israel and the average boy of 17 in America, he's three times as tough. He's better educated, and he's ready for adversity. So we got to make sure that we don't spoil everybody. They got to be brought up properly. Tough. The greatest country in the world to stay there is the hardest thing. And the whole world, China, Russia, everybody trying to dethrone you. And that's why you you got to be tough. Now watch this. That hip again. There. I'm going to stand. I'm going to show you how I swung. And I don't know if I can do it now when I won those three in a row. Watch. There. Nice. >> Wow. >> I don't recommend you do that, but practice you can. >> So really, you don't have to make it complicated. You know, you know the stuff that is taught. I mean, >> that is taught. So there you go from one of the greatest of all time, Gary Player talking about gratitude, appreciation, being as tough as a junkyard dog. He grew up with nothing. Won more ma majors than anyone else, both regular and senior. What a great guy. Uh best sand player of all time for sure. And here he is, by the way, 90 years old. uh and he's still hitting at 250 down the center of the fairway, breaking breaking par all all the time. Uh very inspirational, but you can see he he took nothing for granted and he stayed sharp and he stayed hungry and that never left him. So for all the young folks that are out there, he is a great inspiration. I would uh read up on him uh and so on. So, speaking of inspiration, here is me with Brad Jacobs at the offices of QXO in Greenwich. We had scheduled an hour to talk and it was late on a Friday and we went well over an hour and we were talking about everything from QXO to GXO to business in general to uh transcendental meditation to you name it, we talked about it. And uh and this was just absolutely phenomenal. And by the way, uh real excitement around the new CEO at GXO, Patrick Keller. Uh so um you know, it ju just really amazing to learn from Brad and and his success and and creating huge amounts of value uh consistently over decades now, multiple times. And I talked to uh thanks to Joe Ceckler who uh set it up. that's his communications guy and Mark Manduka his investment guy. Um, and I had a chance to talk to them and they're like, you know, he works non-stop, seven days a week. And you know, these are the type of CEOs that Buffett always talked about. Uh, if you find them, you want to bet on them because they're going to just make you money all day long because they want to win. Uh, and and here's a guy worth some10 billion uh who who didn't have to do it again for years and years. They just like creating value. They like the fulfillment. Like my mentor Jim Ran said in my 20s, if you don't produce, you won't be happy. So, when you get a chance to bet on on someone like this, you do it. And we've done it aggressively in uh GXO and in QXO. And uh thanks to Brad for taking the time out uh to to uh uh to chat on Friday, and I'm sure it will be one of many to come. So, that's exciting. That's with my friend George at Bedford Golf and Tennis on Saturday and my friend Robert who set it up. Thank you for doing that with his lovely wife Desiree. That's a picture of me right before I sprayed it right into the woods. Uh there's Gary Player. Uh what what a class act. I mean I didn't know much about him going in. I mean, I know his record and all that stuff, but uh this guy, it's very rare when you meet, you know, they always say, "Beware of meeting your heroes." Uh because, you know, it's very hard to measure up to your expectations. Here's a guy uh uh that absolutely exceeded all expectations. And uh I I look forward to learning more about him and um and following all the great things he's done. Here's at the Making Money studio with Charles Payne. Always love to go there. He's got the music cranking right before the show starts. Uh here's Caitlyn going a little crazy with the skeletons uh for Halloween, getting all the decorations. We're going to get tons of trick-or-treaters. You know, in Connecticut, everything is, you know, you know, walled off and you have all this land. No one comes up to the house for Halloween. So, we're super excited to uh to do that this year. Gives you some background on the studio here. Here's Annabelle. Went to Astro Camp with her classmates this week. I had a great time learning all this stuff. Uh then that's at the Ryder Cup. I told you it was a barn burner of a trip. What an incredible time. Want to thank Andrew Keys. You all know Andrew. He's got ETHM is the ticker, his Ethereum trust. He put in 700 million of his own Ethereum uh great friend uh client and um uh I invested in his uh uh Ethereum trust and he had a beautiful suite there on the 18th hole. We spent the whole day and uh and great friends. So this is uh at Beth Page Black. If you never played, it's amazing. There's Scotty Sheoffller right there. I'm at the tea box. Uh there's the RDER Cup, etc. And then uh and then I got to play sandwich and Greenwich over the week while I was out there. There's my buddy Blake and George and Skip. Uh super amazing time. Love that flag picture. Uh here the boys back in California. Uh John, David, Chris came out to play. Uh here's a picture they sent me I guess while I was on TV when I was away. That was pretty funny with them thumbs up in front of the TV. And then um got that and I think we're good. So without further ado, let's get down to market commentary. I had the pleasure of joining Stu Vanney today, the great Stu Vney. Thank you to Payton Jennings and Christian Dagger for having me on. Uh, you know, it's interesting. I'm known as being super bullish. And for those of you who've been with me for a while, uh, yeah, I'm bullish because the market goes up 70% of the time and I'm bullish when no one else is bullish. But right now, everyone's bullish. So, uh, so we have built up a little cash. As a matter of fact, we put on in client accounts some some put spreads uh across the board. Uh we're not like it it's less about getting short. It's more about hedging short-term volatility, create some excess cash, and then uh be able to buy even more stuff going into some year-end strength. But I think we're we're in for some chop in coming weeks. And uh so all the new cash coming in, we we'll get that deployed slowly. We'll get you some spreads uh and we'll be able to buy a lot of incredible stuff for those of you who came in this quarter. Super excited. And for the existing ones uh clients, you know, we've been building up some cash. We got plenty of dry powder to buy into any weakness and then ride the year-end rally. So, exciting few weeks ahead. Uh and uh here's what I had to tell Stu about it. >> Uh two and a half minutes to go to the opening bell. All green across the screen, especially the NASDAQ. Big tech's doing well. Uh Tom Hayes joining me this morning. Virtually every market watcher on this program expects a year-end rally. Do you? >> Well, I do, Stu, but I do think we could get a shortterm dip before an endofyear rip. Okay. And I think the reason is we are in a shortterm information vacuum. Okay. We're not going to get the jobs report on Friday, which is very important as it relates to the Fed. And we're going into earnings season with expectations of 7.9% earnings growth. The reason we've raised a little bit of cash and we've been very very bullish as you know and it's and it's worked. We've raised some cash going into October because we hope to buy at lower prices. Okay. And I think the narrative that we're going to see here for for this quarter's earning season is that MAG 7 earnings growth has significantly decelerated due to all of the investment down from over 30% earnings growth last year this quarter to what will be south of 15%. Which is fine except for the fact that the multiples have not come down commensurate with the earnings growth deceleration. And when you look at the indices with MAG7 35% of the waiting, if MAG7 stalls, the indices are going to stall and we're going to hop in there looking for bargain opportunities and then we will see the end ofear rally with Santa. >> Kudos to you, Tom. You recommended Etsy earlier this year and Etsy, the Chsky people, they it's gone up 34% in the last year. Okay. So, would you buy more Etsy now at 70? I'm hoping to buy more in coming weeks if we get a little bit of pullback. The breakthrough in Etsy is the Agentic AI which was announced this year, the partnership uh with Open AI earlier this week which basically says I know you have a couple farms steers and it will come up Etsy will come up right in your Open AI agent and you can order right through Open AI. So this is a huge breakthrough. Their app users are up 7% year-on-year. 600 billion uh of free 600 million of free cash flows. So, this business is growing. It's doing innovative things. And what I love, it's an AI beneficiary versus an AI cost center. >> I like the sound of that. Press a button and get a present for a farmer. That's me. All right, the market is now over. Thanks very much, Tom. The market's >> And we're back. And then I had the pleasure to talk to Char the great Charles Payne. So grateful, by the way. Very grateful for Stu pointing out uh Etsy and very grateful to uh Charles. He put up this grand slam board with uh uh four stocks that we had put out on his show that are up a lot. And then uh and then we also talked about Baxter, which is not up a lot yet, but it's going to be going up a lot. Uh and we explain why. So we'll listen in here. Come back. All right. My first guest is cautious on a Mac 7. Thinks the return on investment something of a valid concern. We're bringing out Great Hill Capital Chairman Thomas Hayes. Thomas, um, so, okay, listen, this since since 2021, the top 10 stocks, 55% of the market, it's, you know, it's hard to fight against this because the guessing game on when this wouldn't be a valid investment. You would have missed out between then and now. >> Well, as you know, we've been raging bulls since the the fall of October 2022. We've recently in the last week and two weeks raised a little bit of cash. Nothing crazy. We just think that this earnings season is going to be the first time that people kind of wake up. Earnings growth for the MAG 7 has cut in half from over 30% last year to under 15% this quarter, but the multiple has not yet contracted at all. We think they got to consolidate. >> I think the irony is that maybe the multiples are down from 2021 on the MAG 7, right? I mean, I think the chart is something like this. Now, again, this is much higher than than people are used to. Also, we can't expect them to grow at the same pace forever, right? >> Correct. But we don't have to assign them the same multiple. 33 times earnings growth for 15% earning 33 times multiple for 15% earnings growth. While the rest of the market you you cut that back, you've got accelerating earnings growth. You have a more reasonable multiple. There's opportunities under the surface. You don't just have to be. And if you're exclusively in indices, you are overweight. These names that are probably due for a little bit of consolidation before the next leg. >> That's why you're in part why you're a stock picker. >> That's correct. >> You took so you took profits out of these names for the most part. Uh we don't have exposure. We have dramatic outperformance against our benchmarks against our indices with zero exposure to the MAG 7 this year. Our biggest contributor was Alibaba. You know that was super hated in the last couple of years. Uh Cooper Standard unrelated stocks. We underwrite. We do private equity in the public market. >> Let's talk about that for a moment because you're a a true buy and hold guy, right? I mean, you know, this is how you make your money and if people are patient, these are just some of the names you've mentioned on this show. Yes. >> Right. And of course that that move in advance auto, right? I mean I was looking for it, right? You've been traveling somewhere. They say you were drinking champagne or something. So up 131% from January. Uh this QXO up 32% from April. And again, you hold these names. Google up 80 184%. Baba starting to make that big move. I think people thought it was going to happen maybe a year or so earlier with all the stimulus, but now they're coming on. >> Are you holding all of these names? Would someone watching this show, would these still be viable investments? Uh, Advanced Auto Parts early days. QXO early days. Brad Jacobs, Baba still early days. One of the cheapest AI plays in the world. Google, we took profit some time back. So, uh, yeah. >> So, now you you had one or two clunkers. One or two so far, but I mean, the track record is phenomenal. Backer is a name I bring up because you've mentioned it more than once in the show. >> It's pulled back a lot. Are you a buyer? Are you still holding? >> Yes, we've been buying this in the last two weeks aggressively. New money coming in. We're buying it aggressively. This is look, healthc care as a sector is at its lowest relative valuation to the S&P. This is a four times in a 100red-year opportunity to buy healthcare. We like Baxter. It's down because of the hurricane Helen recovery. It's taken longer than expected. And the Noam IQ pump, they've got a new CEO coming in. He had a six bagger at his last company ATI within 5 years. He comes from Danaher. He's just coming in right now. This stuff is recovering. Uh they've sold off the diabetes, the slow business. They've delevered the balance sheet. This is a perfect turnaround story. Solveny risk off the table. Trading at nine times earnings historically 16 to 17 times. This thing's going to reacelerate. We think it can be a double or triple over the next three years. >> So they sent me your notes last night and they said uh you had an AI play nov. I'm like wait a minute that's national oil well. Are you kidding me? So this is your sort of co covert uh AI play. Explain it to the audience. >> Okay so they do onshore and offshore rigs for the oil industry. They do sales and they do service. This has one of the best balance sheets over a billion of free cash flow, billion of uh cash on the balance sheet. Uh low debt. This has huge operating leverage to drilling, not necessarily the price of oil and the demand for, you know, data center demand is going up 165% by 2030. 60% is going to be natural gas powered. Uh this is going to be a big beneficiary of that play. Furthermore, it's the energy has the lowest waiting in the S&P since 2020. We were buying Exxon Mobile when energy turned negative, made a fortune. When the waiting of energy gets this low in the indices, it's a huge buying opportunity. This is where we want to play. >> My man, you've been killing it. Congratulations. Congratulations. I'm glad someone's bringing back buy and hold. Good stuff, my man. All right, folks. Now, my next guest runs the the >> And we're back. And then I had the pleasure to be on the Big Money Show last week. By the way, I want to thank um want to thank Nick Palazo and old friend Katherine Meyer. She used to be on the claim and countdown. Now she's the head producer uh over at um at Making Money with Charles Payne. Uh thanks again, Nick. And then I want to thank Madison Myrtto for having me on the Big Money Show for the full two hours. Thanks to my guys Ze for uh is now doing the video. Cut out uh the key 10 or 11 minutes uh that I was on. So, we'll listen in here. A little bit of back and forth with Charlie Gasperino. Tune in for some fire. Uh and here we go. >> Have very positive words to say about your bull market. What do you think about that? >> Yeah, it reminds me of uh Alan Greenspan irrational exuberance in 1996. He was right. Markets were overvalued, but he was four years early. I think the two-sided risk that Powell addresses here, uh, the weight is now shifted to employment and employment is like a frog in a pot. You can stay restrictive so long, so long, but the minute you start to see the layoffs, that can happen very, very quickly. So, we may see a situation where too late Powell becomes just in time POW, provided we get four to five cuts over the next 12 months. And historically, if that is the case, the statistics say in an expansion, you're going to be up 16.1% in the S&P 500 in the next 12 months, assuming we get four cuts into extended. >> So, you think he can kind of resuscitate his credibility by becoming right on time Powell? You think he set himself up well for that? >> I think he might get lucky. I think he was irresponsible being this restrictive for this long. He's destroyed the housing market. That's that's starting to come back now that rates are coming down. We've seen mortgage rates come down. But you've got $ 35 trillion of wealth trapped in people's home equity that they can't access. The minute rates continue to come down and people can access that, this economy is going to boom. >> D issue with you, Tom. He did not destroy the housing market. I mean, let's be real clear. If he lowers interest rate, housing prices are astronomically high. If he lowers interest rates, you're going to make them higher because people going to borrow. >> Yeah. No, I think I think I think this time you're going to be wrong on that, Charlie. And the reason >> are you saying that housing prices aren't like at record highs and people can't buy? >> They are record highs. I think what you're going to see this time, Charlie, is that when rates come down, you're going to see a an amount of supply come on the market. To Dan's point about people getting getting their equity by selling their house, there are people that are waiting and waiting because they don't want to trade out of a 3% mortgage for a 7% mortgage. Price is going to go down. I think you're going to see so much supply hit the market all at once that there's going to be pressure or at least these high prices are going to consolidate for several years. can't I can't remember where that has ever happened because not only the supply you're talking about is not new housing. We're not building a lot of new housing in particularly in the Northeast, but you know I I look at places like South Trust me. >> You know why? Because builders cannot take that risk until they know what >> I know. But there's not enough supply. >> Yeah. >> I'm just telling you >> it's coming. The federal Trump is going to open 500,000 acres in federal land. Uh a lot of >> federal land is going to bail out is going to send housing prices down. It's going to create supply. >> I don't believe it. I It just It never has happened like that. >> Charlie, this reminds me that is historical anomaly. >> Charlie, this reminds me of a year ago when everyone was telling me, "China is uninvestable. Don't dare invest in Alibaba stock at $60. Now it's $175 today. It's one of the top stocks in the market. >> Wait until the Senate. This is going to happen. Wait until the Senate pushes a bill that delists all your Chinese stocks because it it the rumblings are there." I will say one thing on the sidelines in money markets right and CDs and and and as rates come down that's a that's everybody always talks about that avalanche of cash coming into markets is is that kind of what we have to reckon with or be prepared for in the coming months I don't know years >> forced on the risk curve I will say when Powell talks about the indices 40% is the mag 7 mag 7 is trading at 33 times earnings their earnings growth has decelerated to 10 to 15 times 10 to 15% we're going to see this quarter so their multiple stayed high while the earnings growth has compressed. If you look under the surface, small caps 35% earnings growth next year trading at around 16 to 17 times earnings. Unmnificent 493, all the real businesses, all the main street businesses are still undervalued. There's a lot to do under the surface. So, we could see a situation where the indices i.e. S&P is basically a MAG7 index right now consolidate sideways and so much money is made under the surface for all these lagards. The number one thing with small caps is refinancing risk. Rates come down, they refinance, small caps go up. They're breaking out to 400. >> How do they get impacted by tariffs though? >> We shall we will it's on a company by company basis and now it's baked into the price. >> We will that it's in their they will earn more cabbage in this environment if they um are embrace conservatives and embrace the Trump administration from a regulatory perspective. They only care about themselves. Yeah. And their shareholders, they have an obligation to their shareholders. And if you look at all these CEOs, whether it's Tim Cook at Apple, whether it's Mark Zuckerberg, they all blow with the wind. Sundar Pachai, now they're all going to the inauguration at Trump's inauguration, >> the advertisers, but they're sniveling little, >> but they have a fiduciary obligation to their owners, to the shareholders to make money. So if that means making nice with each administration, that's exactly what they're going to do. And that's their number one job. of OpenAI to buy those chips. At some level, when you got that much vendor financing and you're not getting your financing from your customers, you got to ask, are you sort of in a bubbly situation that could come sooner rather than later? >> I think so. And I think it's to the point about maybe the indices are fully valued as Jay Pal was saying, but under the surface. So, what's the play today? Everything's down. Mag 7 is down. You know what's up? The only sector that's exclusively up is energy. Okay, energy. You know the AI industry is writing checks that the energy industry cannot cash. Okay, that is the bottleneck for AI. So when you look forward there's going to be 165% of increase in demand for data center by 2030 according to Goldman Sachs. 60% of that is going to be powered by natural gas. These stocks the energy sector is trading at 15.2 times earnings. Okay, compared to the S&P 500 at 22 times, >> they are going to have 17% earnings growth next year, which is the second highest earnings growth sector. That's greater than the S&P overall at 13. >> So, it's great for energy. >> This is only good for it was used, by the way. Those those pipes this is this is only good for three years because of the life of the chip in essence. >> Yeah. I'll give you a perfect example to your all of your points. Amazon.com 2000 the stock was pricing in 15 years of good things to come. Everything they promised would happen they actually fulfilled on and more. The problem was the stock in 2000 was pricing in all of those great things happening already. And over the next 3 years the stock price fell 90% even though revenues kept going up, earnings kept going up, cash flow kept going up, fundamentals fast enough for the market. >> Exactly. So, so it the question is how much of all the good that's to come in AI is currently already priced in in some of the stocks that are trading at 100 times sales, 200 time sales. And >> I'm just going to say this is this a shoe shine boy moment like I get pitched once a day on an a new AI company. You got to see my company. You got to you got to you got to you got to write about it. And I'm like no >> I I will get he mentioned Alibaba at the top of the hour. the fact that Alibaba's shares are soaring because they're in spending money. >> Yeah. >> Spending uh AI's budget goes past 50 billion. That's fantasy land. >> Yeah. >> All right. >> Yeah. Well, they they they had when we got involved, they had $80 billion of cash on their balance sheet and you don't get credit for cash. You only get credit for potential future earnings power. So they're putting that cash to use because they're finally saying we have a way to get a higher return on invested capital by investing in AI than just buying back our own shares. And that's that's why the market loves it. >> But are they getting a higher return? Nobody really knows. They just like the AI. >> Well, they're generating 20 billion. >> I can flush it down an AI toilet for you. >> That's not a plumber. >> Uh we'll leave it here. coming up a Trump executive order that allows Americans to diversify their 401k portfolio beyond >> into a more future oriented posture with respect to what people are investing. What do you think? >> Yeah, I mean as a value manager I would say no what you need to be is in all value stocks but I think I think it's people's money and they should choose what they think is going to be best provide for their future. uh you know if that's crypto if that's growth stocks if that's value stocks if that's fixed income uh according to their their risk profile and their other sources of income uh I think that's critical as long as they allow hedge funds I'm okay with it uh but uh >> are they I don't know about that >> I don't think they are they'll allow private equity and private credit private credit >> so we just need better lobbyists uh on >> I wouldn't sue Vanguard and say that was unsuitable for me someone should have guided me to lower the percentage weight in my in my based on my age, etc., etc. So, I think Dan hit the nail on the head. If it goes well, everyone's happy. If it doesn't go well, there's >> We don't advise you. >> It doesn't make sense. It's the woman whose son died surfing on a subway car and she's suing Tik Tok and Instagram. >> We got to go. Uh, Charlie, great stuff. Thanks for that. >> We do need the Fed, but I will say post World War II, we were at 125% debt to GDP. By 1957, we were at 63% debt to GDP. How did we do that? We did it through growth, massive growth. And by the way, we ran inflation a little bit above trend, 3 to 5%, it we had massive growth. Debt to GDP came down. Here's the thing about the dual mandate. One side you can fix if you're wrong. The other side you can't. If you're wrong on employment and the layoffs start, you can't put that genie back in the bottle. It's deflationary. if you're wrong on inflation and let's say that you know he acknowledged yesterday by the way that tariff based inflation never really came okay he acknowledged it was less than expected um he could he could actually hike rates 25 basis points if he got that wrong if he gets employment wrong >> and you you you've seen it before you keep cutting rates and it's deflationary and you got fear and you got this negative spiral and I'm worried about employment that you got this boiling frog in a pot and they're saying we can be 200 basis points restrictive just Look, the unemployment rate's only 4.3 and when it shifts, it shifts. And you saw all these >> What are we afraid of? What? Just take a rip at the ball. Talk about But I think he's the exception, not the rule. >> Yeah. And people vote their pocketbooks. You saw in Trump 1.0. Real wages for Main Street went up dramatically. Main Street did better on a relative basis. Wall Street did fine. Main Street did better in terms of percentage gains and overall uh flourishing. I think we're going to see the same exact thing h happen in Trump 2.0. I think Mdani will wind up being a lightning rod in this country where people say that's what we don't want and it may be actually backfire and and help the right policies get more widespread adoption. >> So will the stock exchange move to Miami? >> You know, it's funny. I was headed to Dubai just just asking. >> They got one in Texas. >> The state and local tax rate, we've talked about this. State and local tax rate in New York's 14.8%. 8%. State and local tax rate in Miami is zero. >> Look, money goes where it's treated best. I was talking to a friend who moved down there uh a number of years ago. I was headed to Dubai. He goes, "You know, when I was your age, the the financial centers of the world were New York and London. Today, it's Miami and Dubai." Why is that? Because of favorable policies. That's where money flows to. So, it wouldn't surprise me whatsoever. >> Could this set and these lights move to um Miami? Just asking. You are you gonna pay for the moving truck, Larry? >> And we're back. And then want to thank uh Nikette Nishant and Sucriti Gupta for including me in their article on Reuters. Uh and then we got uh a quote of the week from Warren Buffett. The stock market is a device for transferring money from the impatient to the patient. That's basically our investment strategy. We're patient when no one else is. Uh we look for opportunity when everyone else is running out of the emergency exit and uh and we play the time arbitrage game. So, let's get down. Oh, and then finally, I want to thank um I want to uh recognize just Lane for sending in his picture this week. Le Febre. Uh he's at his daughter's college golf tournament with his hedge fund tips hat and he's got some earpods there. Probably listening to some hedge fund tips with Tom Hayes. Super grateful. And you know, as a reminder each week, uh the way this thing continues to be put out every week for free and deliver value to everyone is um it grows and and you have control over that happening. And so many of you, I mean, we had so many people come in this quarter. I'm so grateful. And I would say 25 to 30% of them were friends of friends who introduced them to the podcast. They listened for a while. They made some money from the ideas and then they came in from uh as clients. So, please keep sharing uh each week. If you get value, share with one person that you think could get the same value and would benefit. And the way the easy way to do that is get yourself a hat or a t-shirt or a golf polo like I'm wearing right now or a mug. Uh and when people ask, tell them all about it and uh the difference it's made for you. And it's just going to keep growing uh virally that way. And we're going to keep doing it and keep delivering value and uh and make a difference in in the best way that we can. So uh send in your photos. We've got way more orders than pictures. Please keep sending them in. let's build out this community and um and that's that. So, let's get down to business. Uh here's a a a stock tweet from Zero Hedge. quote, "Oracle stock jumped 25% after being promised $60 billion a year from Open AI, an amount of money Open AI doesn't earn yet, to provide cloud computing facilities that Oracle hasn't built yet, and which will require 4.5 gawatt of power, equivalent of 2.25 25 Hoover Dams or four nuclear plants as well as increasing borrowing by Oracle whose debt to equity ratio is already 500% compared to 50% for Amazon, 30% for Microsoft and even less at Meta and Google. In other words, the tech capital cycle may be about to change. That's from JP Morgan's Michael Seymbleist. Uh so just keep an eye on this when I'm when I'm being a little cautious about Mag 7. It's not like putting my finger in the wind and hoping I'm right. There's math to to what I'm talking about uh in terms of the earnings deceleration, in terms of the capex, in terms of the return on invested capital. So, you know, whether it's the next few weeks or or two years from now, uh the key is price is what you pay, value is what you get. And um you can't time these things perfect, but what you can do is outperform and completely avoid them. So you don't have to wake up one day with a portfolio down 20% because you're in these high-flying stocks. You can wake up with a portfolio of durable, sustainable, growing cash flow, uh with reasonable multiples, and you add the derivative overlay and you make excess returns and you absolutely destroy all the indices. uh and um and you don't take that herd risk because sheep get slaughtered sooner or later. Okay, moving along. Uh Strategus, uh thanks uh Bobby for sending this over. We've been talking about healthcare and it's interesting you know in an 8 to12 stock portfolio you can only have so much of each sector and we've continued to say over and over uh we want more exposure in healthcare you know between XBI the biotech basket um which is has already started to move and Baxter which we've been leaning into on weakness uh that's more than enough health care I mean I I actually looked at every midcap and large cap stock. I think you could certainly buy some Fizer. It's moved a little bit this week. Probably has a lot more to move. There may be one or two other drug companies that we're looking at. But I think if you got one or two solidsized positions in healthcare, you're going to benefit. And and here's some of the reasons why, which we've covered in recent weeks. First off, healthc care sector as a weight in the S&P 500 is going back all the way 20 years ago. very similar to energy which again just as we have the two exposures to healthc care in XBI basket and Baxter um we have the two exposures to energy in uh national oil well Varco uh nov and um uh comtock resources and that's way more than enough usually you know if you're running a concentrated book it's one per sector but um these two I want to be overweight just because of the unbelievable you know, four times in a 100redyear generational opportunities for these S&P 500 healthcare sector relative to S&P during the four-year cycle. This is the time of year when um you get the most amount of returns in the shortest period of time in the four-year cycle. So, it starts October of this year, which is the first year in the presidential cycle. And healthcare tends to go straight up into the election. the second year, the midterm election cycle. So, uh, for those of you who are, uh, doubting Baxter, this is the this is the period when it's just going to absolutely take off, uh, and biotech and everything else. So, th those are going to be the leaders, uh, and and have a lot of contribution next year. And that's why we've been leaning in and, uh, why we talked about it for Charles S&P 500 corrections and performance one year following a correction. midterm election year tend to have a little more draw down. So probably a little more chop next year, a lot more opportunity and then performance out and normal non-midterm election year average draw down being 12.7 and uh and the follow-through also being less. So we're we're benefiting from the larger returns here. S&P 500 price return 12 months following midterm election. Uh let's see here. So you tend to have a weaker return in the second year which makes sense. That would be 2026. Uh because healthc care is obviously outperforming. That's a defensive sector which is why we've been loading on staples. We're going to talk about one. We talked about Dagio. Talk about Estee Lauder. all these stocks are going to do very very well in a year like next year starting now. Uh and that's why we've been positioning. That's why they're out of favor now. That's why they're cheap. That's why they're there's opportunity. But now that we see the data that backs all that up from Strategus here um and then following the midterm uh election years, which tend to be bumpy, uh 2027, you get outsized returns again. Uh here we are. You could see healthcare S&P. So look at this ladies and gentlemen. Health care tends to be up 9% in the midterm election year, which is 2026, while the S&P tends to only be up 62%. What does this imply, ladies and gentlemen? This implies exactly what I've been talking about. Mag 7 has to stall for this theme to play out because it's 35% of the way to the S&P and under the surface, fortunes can be made in these defensives that people have left for dead, consumer staples, healthc care, uh, etc., which we have exposure getting ready for next year. Uh, so we're going to use the next four weeks. We're going to get all this money to work. By the way, uh I've had a couple uh people call me like, "Hey, I noticed you have like cash 10 12%, you know, you you got more cash than normal uh in the last couple of days. You know, are you putting that to work?" Blah blah blah. Yeah, we're going to put it to work. We're going to be patient. Uh and when it's time to put it to work, it's going to be very, very aggressive and it's going to be all at once. And it's going to be sometime in the next uh 1 day to 8 weeks. and uh and you'll be set up beautifully for everything that's going to take place into year end and into 2026. And it's nice to ring the register when you've had uh unbelievable year. Unbelievable year. So, um all right, healthc care subindustry years of outperformance. So, you can see against the S&P in the midterm election year. So, it seems pharma tends to do well, so that'll help the XBI. Biotech does really well. Um, equipment does really well, that's Baxter, healthcare distribution, etc. Pharma and S&P average returns during the four-year presidential cycle. Again, S&P does poorly. Pharma does well, almost double digits. Biotech crushes it 16, this is from 1993, 16.2%. Biotech is up on average in the midterm election year versus the S&P at 1.7. Healthcare equipment up 8.3 versus 1.7. So, we're we're positioned for all this really well. uh healthcare sector rel relative to S&P 500 f federal healthcare spending. Okay. Um projected Medicaid cuts that starts next year. So that's why sentine is down so big. That's why we didn't do anything about that. That'll be that'll be a buy at some point. Maybe it already was. Um, okay. JP Morgan boost Alibaba price target to street high on AI and cloud. So, what did they do? They moved the target price target up to $240 Hong Kong, which means it's about $246 248 US. If you've got the Baba shares, it's 246 248. If you got the Hong Kong shares, it's 240. And um opinion follows trend. What else do you want me to say? Uh shutdowns on average, they make it all back once they reopen, but you lose onetenth of 1% of real GDP per week while it's closed. Maybe uh we stay closed for a little while and that creates a little volatility in October. or more likely it gets resolved quickly. Uh and you just get normal October volatility. Uh US auto sales crushed last year in September. Um so we like to see that the year-on-year growth. Unemployment rate versus recessions. This is from Jim Paulson. These numbers, this is what keeps the Fed, this spike higher is what keeps the Fed aggressive in cuts in coming months. This is the most important thing to keep an eye on. You can see unemployment rate starting to turn up. Fourth quarter is here. This is from Dietrich over at Carson. Fourth quarter tends to be fourth quarter is the strongest quarter of the year. So any downs, you know, if we get a five, three or 5% pullback in the Q's, uh NASDAQ, that's, you know, these that's probably a signal to start to lean in and buy. I don't expect anything super pronounced uh uh at the index level, but I do expect some chop uh and want to take advantage of that aggressively uh into year end, which tends to be strong. October down three years in a row. Been a long time. Let's see. Yeah, the last time you had So, the last two years October was down. I would say four out of the last seven years October was down. Last time that happened was in the mid70s where you had three years in a row. Shutdowns add drama but stocks don't really care. Um so you see these periods where the market was down between three to 4 and a.5% and then after it gets resolved market tends to be up. Here's Cox Automotive uh estimates for US SAR new sales in 2025 just got updated and upgraded. Uh 16.1 million baseline. That's going to be very good for Cooper Standard. I'm sure they had a strong quarter given all the numbers we're seeing. Uh new light vehicle sales again strong 16.2 million annualized SAR in September versus 15.8 uh last September. So that's moving up in the right direction. Year-to date 2024 was 15.6. Year to date this year is 16.3 up 4.6%. Um the baseline moved up from 15.6 to now 16.1 midpoint. Incentives continue to stay elevated. Uh so it's starting to move into a buyer market which moves. Volume EV sales forecast still were very were very strong. We saw it from uh um Tesla today. Uh my wife contributed to that fall playlist. First cut is the deepest rate policy moving down again. Adding tailwind for lower taxes and regulation. Expiring tax credits help set an EV sales record in Q3. Uh okay, we got that. China investors snapped up Alibaba shares in September at record rates. Now it's I believe 11% of the share count is now held by mainland Chinese investors which was part of our original thesis playing out in real time. China ashares retail sentiment proxy it's elevated but nowhere near maxed out which is exciting. Opinion follows trend potential institutional buying into Chinese equities just getting started as you can see from that chart. US new home sales jump unexpectedly in August. That's uh due to lower rates. Uh okay, here is from Fundstrat talking about today the 30-year mortgage is 6.33. the implied rate prospectively based on the 10-year uh spread between 10 and 30 years implies 5.58 30-year fix imminently. We've been saying since a long time by the end of this year 30-year fix would go below six and that would be massive demand for housing and I think that's going to create a a record amount of supply that's going to hit the market all at once. Uh K Schiller I thought was really interesting was down year on year. Prices are starting to come down. What happens is all these sellers that have been holding out for longer rates as they see prices things not selling above ask anymore starting to sell below ask that they all start to panic in that they better get out while the getting's good. And then they all hit the market all at once. And that's where you start to get the prices come down even though you have all these buyers. And then the buyers will be in the driver's seat for the first time in a long time as all this supply hits all at once due to the the market getting unfrozen by normalized rates. So, it's going to be counterintuitive. I know Charlie had a hard time with that one on the big money show, but you'll see how that plays out. Uh Q4 seasonality is supportive for the emerging market equity wally to extend into the new year. That's good. Investor positioning remains conservative in emerging markets with ample scope to reach historical average allocations. You know, we we showed the Chinese allocations last week. It's staggering how behind the curve not only active managers but international managers are. They are screwed because Chinese stocks have outperformed US more than 3 to one. Um and uh pretty amazing. Okay. Every income group is significantly less levered relative to history. That means the personal balance sheets are better than ever. That's from Carson. Uh what do we got here? Okay. Next 12 months price to sales and price to earnings. You see uh the cheapest ones being what are we talking about? What outperforms in the midterm election? Health care, consumer staples, defensive, all the indices are getting hit and real estate. That would be REITs like we've got uh Crown Castle. So these are the three areas that are showing low relative valuation which also uh not by accident happen to be those areas that outperform in midterm election years when the indices get choppy. Healthcare staples. What does staples mean? Defensives like um Dagio, like Estee Lauder, um uh like Hormell Foods. We got we're we are ready, baby. Uh and there are 35% more home sellers than buyers. Okay, so this was basically the peak in prices. Now, now the supply is starting to come online. You're going to see it in prices. Uh, so if you need to get out of a house, you probably want to do it sooner rather than later. I think prices are going to come down, not go up. Obviously, it's dependent on a market by market. You're already seeing that in Florida, uh, pretty aggressively a little bit in Texas. Uh, all the super hot COVID markets are now cooling and I think in a year, year and a half, it's going to be a buyer market in a lot of these places. This is really interesting. During the dot crash from 2000 to 2002, the S&P 500 equal weight was positive from the peak of the.com bubble all the way through June of 2020 2002. So while the NASDAQ dropped 80 90% in those two years from 2000 to 2002 um the equal weight S&P was even and if you look Buffett actually outperformed because he was buying Proctor and Gamble etc. So again, if you're overly concentrated in seven stocks, uh, aka you own too much S&P index, um, keep in mind, I'm not predicting anything like that coming. I don't think that's the case. These are profitable companies. I do think they are going to take a breather. CPI inflation. Let's see. Foreign holdings of US equities hit record. That's the herd emerging market currency index now breaking out finally. Dollar weakening. US equity flows inflows still dominating year-to- date. China missed the whole thing and that's just getting started. Global net equity supply has gone down. Yeah. billion seasonally, electric power, office buildings, data center, construction spending, electric power, data centers, office buildings down. I think office, I mean, we we covered that on the podcast two years ago when we bought Gronado and that was a quick double. I I implored all of my wealthy real estate clients, buy as much office as you can. Um, I think we missed a lot of it. I I I I think a lot of people missed it because a lot of that office stuff has been soaked up and has doubled. I don't know if it's out of the woods as an asset class, but uh that was the time to buy. Obviously, we made our money in Vornnado because we do public markets, not private, but I hope some of you took me up, made a ton of money on office, and as you liquidate the offices, send some money over to Great Hill Capital, and uh let's compound that for you over the next 10 years. Uh irrational exuberance, profit growth mostly drove returns. We agree. Despite AI boom, net investment share of GDP is anemic versus history. I think that's going to be changing. There's a lot of commitments because of the White House's policy that we're going to start to see flush through in the next three years, which is going to be really, really good for the economy. Um, here's a chart that's interesting. This is the S&P returns versus the AI bulls versus bears. They're not super excited yet. Um, so we'll see how this plays out. I mean, there are a lot of crosswinds here. I would say, you know, the Q's are way more overcooked than uh the Russell or the Dow S&P somewhere in the middle. Obviously, here's the seasonal four-year election cycle. This is in line with what we've been saying. You get this huge rally, then you get some sideways chop uh all the way through the election and then straight up after the mid midyear election. So, this is this is uh heaven for us. these choppy sideways markets is like uh a wet dream for what for what we do over here at Great Hill Capital. Um we're exciting. We we love boring years where the indices don't do much. I think the S&P is up 12 or 13% this year and this has been just unbelievable. So, um all right, XLE seasonality. This is energy. We've been talking about that our exposure with the two key names. um equity sentiment still not over there. So that's why I think you could see some consolidation and chop in the MAG7 and the overall under the surface a lot to be done, a lot to be bought in those sectors that that we uh pointed out do do very well in midterm election years. GDP now estimates going up. Um this is from Funstrat not overbought. I I I tend to agree it's not overbought. Uh they're implying 69.50. I think we get 69.50 in the next 6 or nine months for sure. Uh but I think there going to be a couple detours on the way to the promised land. So uh something to keep in mind there. Consumer spending still running well above prepandemic trend. executed buybacks are record foreign holdings of Chinese assets expand across the board. So they're just coming off the mat now. That's good to see. Stocks, loans, healthc care is going to have the largest earnings growth in 2026. You can see here materials is up there. Staples is up there. That's why white you want to have exposure. Here's the Russell 2000 just breaking out. Long way to go. 82% of global central banks have cut rates over the last 6 months, the highest level since 2020. So that is stimulative. We need to pay attention to that. One thing I do have my eye on just as something that I'm paying attention to is sovereign debt in Europe. Again, I know that was an issue in 2011. I'm keeping my eye on spreads and that's why I'm uh there are a lot of factors that go into my short-term uh slightly defensive posture. Uh that's one of them that we're keeping an eye on. If you remember, we had been keeping an eye on JGBs. Now we're focused on European debt and um to be determined. Maybe not an issue over there, but something to keep an eye on. Uh forward price to sales ratios of S&P without Magnificent 7. So, Mag 7, you can see eight times get to the S&P X Mag 7 three times. Um, and you pull out the mag 7, it's two times. All right. Uh, okay. That's by sector. It's from Paulson. Okay, it's good. Uh, US and Europe have alternated cycles of outperformance. So, you can see here US outperformed. It's time for XUS outperformance, which we started to see. But seeing it visually going all the way back, you know, some 55 years, uh, makes it clear because you get stuck in recency bias and you see what's happened the last 14 years and you think that's going to persist forever. Uh, it's not. US stocks have a higher index weight in the world world index relative to 20 years ago. I think that's going to normalize as well. Go back here and see what happens. uh energy super underweight, healthc care super underweight, staples super underweight, material super underweight. So paying attention there. Money market fund assets. So I think as we get through this as rates come down that money is going to be forced out on the risk curve. That's what helps the postelection rally uh in 2027. Straight up ch China set for longest winning streak since 2018. very excited to see that and that persisted all the way through 2020. So, we've got a lot of gas in the tank left in China. Um, we harvested a lot of uh options by the way in the last couple of days across the board. Um, and um, no stock. Stock we let run. were fine, but uh we had we had a lot of Intel options that were up enormously. We took profits on them. We have not sold a share of stock, nor will we. That game is just getting started. But if you've paid attention to the podcast long enough, when we take options off that have run up a lot and been super multibaggers, whether it's BABA or Boeing or Generrack or Intel, uh, and we made a super amount of money in a short period of time. Uh usually you'll find if you go back and look that the stock uh stalled for several weeks or or months after we uh after we took profits on the options even though we kept 100% of the stock for the long term. Um valuations across US sectors are currently at a premium to Europe. That's going to be harder and harder to maintain. Non-reessionary rate cuts are positive for equities. We've covered that multiple times on TV. Up on average 16% 12 months later. You do have the headwind of the midterm election year seasonality as well. So, you know, you hedge that and how do you play it? You go to the areas that outperform in those environments, defensive, staples, healthcare, uh, etc. And other areas that are out of favor like energy, etc. Baba hits 27 days of net buying from mainland investors via southbound stock connect. I mean this is tomorrow's newspaper today. This is all we were saying right before they open that up. Watch what happens. Watch what happens. And it's happened. So now just about as much percentage of Baba is owned by mainland as uh 10 cent was owned before uh Baba shares became available. So um as anticipated seasonality tends to be really good in Q4. So, it's it's not a time to get super bearish, but it was a time to ring the register on a lot of things that made obscene amounts of money in a very very short period of time. Uh, and have that cash ready. And if if the market runs away and you have a little more cash than you had, it's not the end of the world because the remainder of the stock and options that are long will do well. And we've also uh uh bought some some puts and put spreads across all accounts that uh if we do get that three to 5% dip, we're going to have even more cash to put to work into year end, which is pretty pretty exciting. Uh it's it's been been a busy exciting day. Uh investing in the picks and shovels of AI. Okay. Equity position has room to grow. I I agree with that. over time large cap record large cap equity outflows over the last two weeks. That's interesting to see aggressive selling last two weeks. There was some weakness in the Russojanna Yam Kapoor period as we had anticipated. Uh so a lot of people probably sold into that. Um but let's see how this plays out over the next few weeks. I think the earnings are going to be a key factor. I think the jobs report is going to be a key factor. the um shutdown if it's extended could be a catalyst, but uh that will that will claw right back after it's over. So, you could see a scenario maybe where it is shut down for four, five weeks and then you rally into your end once they get it resolved. You know, maybe they don't let them go home for Thanksgiving. Who knows? Uh we ant we estimate the fixing the housing shortage and restoring will require three to four 3 to four million additional units in line with shortage estimates. We've covered that in the past. That's going to be a function of opening federal land which is going to help Stanley Black & Deckers, Generax, QXO, uh, etc. So, we we've got a great amount of exposure to that. Octo October historically most volatile month of the year for stocks. Average October volatility is 33% above average for the other 11 months. It's not priced in in the VIX. It's not priced in in an option premium premium. The time to buy insurance is before the storm. Um, not after the house is already on fire. The time to buy straw hats is in the winter. And that's what we do here at Great Hill Capital. We buy straw hats in the winter. And in summer when everyone wants them, we help them out and we mark it up and we lay it off. Rinse and repeat. So uh next second best September of the past 27 years global equity valuations this is US at 22.8 times Eurozone at 14.6 six times, emerging markets at 14.1 times, and China at 13.9 times. So, you tell me where you want to buy. University of Michigan consumer sentiment index. This is actually bullish. Uh we covered this on a couple of the shows. On average, markets up 24% after a consumer sentiment wash out of this magnitude. We saw it in 2020, 2011, 2008, 1990, 1980, etc. An interesting thing this time is watch what they say versus watch what they do. They're still spending like like the count like there's no tomorrow, and they're still saying that they couldn't be more depressed. So, kind of an interesting divergence right now. Market cap waitings. Defensives are at the lowest waiting since 2000 when you wanted to be buying defensives handover fist and 1979. Same story. By the way, Russell 2000 small caps outperformed the NASDAQ tech in Q3. Talk about a tide change. So that is a preview of coming attractions. Uh boy, we've got a lot of great data. The sellside indicator was unchanged in September towards the top end of the a range here in terms of extreme bullishness for stocks. Um, small cap healthc care's underperformance matches 1999. You couldn't give them away and then uh from 2000 on you had the biggest outperformance in the short shortest period of time for the next two years. So that's what's setting up here. same you know healthcare again going back to 1999 relative valuation it's huge opportunity we have our exposure that we need we'll consider uh additional exposure but you know I felt really relieved on the one hand I didn't want to add a third position and on the other hand I didn't want to miss a a four time in a 100redy year to lean in and honestly I couldn't find anything that was pound the table cheap and interesting. There were a couple like biomarin and uh aluminina and I just really couldn't get comfortable with those. I'm really really comfortable with uh the basket of biotech and and uh and Baxter. There's one other that we're working on. I think Fizer would be one you could buy if you really wanted to have more exposure. Hopefully it takes a breather in the next couple weeks you can get some of that. We we've talked about that on the AMAs and just said yes yes yes. But um I don't love individual drug companies, but I think that one's got got some more room to run. I don't know if it's going to meet our IRRa hurdles e even, you know, because if it goes to 45, you're still not even at a double in a few years. So, uh but anyway, there's there's stuff to do there. Performance during government shutdowns covered that ranges uh up to four and a half%. And that's that. Okay. So um wanted to cover some just general ind indicators. If you look at the put call ratio 10day put call ratio it's very very subdued. This is the time uh where you can get insurance very very cheaply and we took advantage of that today. Um this divergence is very interesting. It's going to either resolve with the 1% EMA of advanced decline ratio playing massive catch up to price or you're going to see the NASDAQ catch down. I think it's going to be the latter. Um but again, I'm not calling for anything major. I think it's 3 to 5% on the cues is probably all we need. Um but you know, being open-minded and wanting to take advantage of that versus chasing up some of these other things. NYC Burke high low rolling over that's a sign of weakness the indices have not followed yet but they always do um and these are just a handful of the things that we look at same with this Dow intermediate term breath momentum uh is down the indices haven't caught down yet they always do uh same thing with the midcap intermediate term volume momentum oscillator indices have not caught down they always do so you know there's a lot of new money coming in at the beginning of a quarter. Uh you have to beware of getting faked out by that and uh positioned with some cash and some some hedges to to really uh take advantage of of uh any bargains that show up and and uh uh we are we are ready and excited for that. So you just see one by one these indices mlen summation rolling over indices haven't caught up yet. they tend to roll over early and the indices catch down on a delayed basis. So we're seeing it across too many of these uh NYC Mlen summation same thing starting to roll over indices haven't caught down. Um and and I don't know if it's a huge catch down. I think it's going to be more like this this aggressive rally coming out of the COVID lows and then late October late by October uh it basically just went back and retested you know a little bit of that before the next like higher I think you could see something like that something like this chop um but you know that you know if you have an index even if it's just the Q's catching down three to five percent you're gonna have some names under there that are down 20% and uh and that's what people aren't prepared for uh at the moment. Skew uh this is kind of an aftershock here with skew. We pay a lot of attention to skew and um you know you've had this you had this huge one. You had the correction before April and then you have this aftershock and then you get a little more weakness. Um it's not always the case but you usually do get weakness after the aftershock of elevated skew. So that's another thing. this Elliot wave pattern, we don't pay a lot of attention, but when it's on the downtrend, you know, you you got some wind in the face. Uh, and it tends to be kind of a weaker period for the most part. Little weakness, little chop, little chop, weakness, weakness. So, uh, we don't live or die by any of these, but we pay attention to them. Okay. So, um that was about the one trillion parameter model and why Baba's crushing it on the open model versus the ones who tried to do the closed model. They went in the right direction. China's holiday spree service pivot may revive consumer stocks. China's market shed uninvestable tag as global funds return. I mean, you can't make this up, ladies and gentlemen. Those of you who have been with us for two years when we were pounding the table, we were like every day was China is uninvestable and I told them I was going to make a stock screen and just, you know, do Google alerts for the word uninvestable because they're the generational opportunities. And sure enough, now they've taken the tag off. Does that mean they're bu ringing the bell at the top? uh maybe short-term consolidation, but uh I think we're early days in this, but it's just so nice to see this thesis play out. And for those of you who stuck with it and made, you know, just insane amounts of money and now I've become customers, I'm very very grateful. Uh but as much as I did it and I was helpful, you did it and you had the fortitude to stick through and um super super excited. Hang Sang hits four-year high, remains 40% below all-time high. That's from Brendan Ahern. lot of room to run. China open stock option market to foreign investors. Alibaba's Quen 3 Omni tops hugging face AI ranking as Chinese open systems flourish. China's AI boom could outlast the US. Why Alibaba's bet is just the start. This is from the famous author who wrote 135 consecutive weeks of negative articles about China. Um, and now that Alibaba is up 3x from when she was on China, she is now getting bullish. So, it's just the way it goes. Cityroup forecast big. You know what? What angers me about that is not that it was cuz for us it was great. She gave me more stock than I could have ever bought at a lower price than I could have ever bought it. But what angers me about that situation is the amount of poor, vulnerable people who got shaken out of a really good company that was generating $25 billion of free cash flow that had $80 billion of cash on the balance sheet that had grown revenues by 800%, free cash flow by 500%, was trading below 2014 prices. and articles like that from people who didn't take the time to actually do their homework and scare the out of people out of their stock at the exact wrong time. Never mind, you know, not encouraging them to buy it when it was down, but but actually forcing them out at the wrong time. Uh it's such a disservice. It's it's um I it's never going to change. So, I shouldn't I shouldn't be focused on the way things should be. That's just the way things are. opinion follows trend. But I just feel bad for all the people that didn't get a chance to make a fortune because they got swayed by misinformation and sentiment and emotion. Um uh it's uh it's it's unfortunate, but for those of you who are listening to Hedge Fund Tips with Tom Hayes, you were buying Baba at $58 till your fingers bled. Uh and uh I'm super happy for you. Cityroup forecast big tech's AI spending across 2.8 trillion by 2029. Intel stock pops on news company is in early talks to add AMD as a customer. Guys, tomorrow's newspaper today. Here's another one. You couldn't give it away at 189, $20. Everyone was on it. Everyone was on me when I would go on TV and talk about Intel. You know, simple pitch. If they liquidate it tomorrow, I get 22 bucks. if uh if it stays in business, it's worth 45. If they actually produce advanced chips, it's worth 100 plus. And everyone would laugh, snicker, blah blah blah. And now you've got the government backs stop. And it wasn't a genius play. They had no choice. We couldn't let the future rely on one company that was within missiles length of China. Taiwan, you know, if Taiwan semiconductor goes out of business tomorrow, Nvidia's out of business, ARM hold uh AMD's out of business, ARM holdings out of business, everyone's out of business. The world stops except for China if they took it over. So, the US government had no choice but to make chips in the US. And the only US company that was at the 10 yard line was Intel. Like, this was such an obvious play. And I got more push back almost on Intel at 20 than I did on Alibaba at 60. Um or Boeing at 135. But you know, leaving that aside or or you remember Disney at 85, go woke, go broke. That was the theme, you know. So guys, what I'm trying to communicate to you is to ignore the short-term noise. Look under the hood. Do the fundamental analysis. Use common sense. Uh, and when you have a great company, bet bet big and and know what you own. Do the work so you don't get swayed out by people that are making a very small amount of money to write insanely misleading headlines. And not because they're trying to mislead you, but because they don't know any better. If they knew any better, they would be running a fund and helping people make a lot of money. So um so that's that Intel approaches Taiwan Semiconductor for investments on partnership. Um Intel said to seek investment from Apple. So the game is on early days. It's almost doubled in a few weeks. So it's going to rest now. That's why we took profits on a bunch of options. Uh but we haven't sold one share of stock and if it would get a a nice enough pullback we can actually buy more stock which would be really awesome. Don't know if we're going to get that opportunity, but we got more than more than enough. That thing stayed between 18 and 20 for far too long. So, we just bought every single every single share we could. Uh Trump takes aim at chip makers with new plan to throttle imports. That helps Intel. Summer 2025 was the strongest buyers market in records dating back to over a decade. That's from Red Finudes. That has relates to housing. New home sales surge over 20% to three-year high as lower mortgage rates spurred demand. So again, what I'm saying is playing out. Prices are coming down. Demand is going up and supply is hitting the market all at once. FOMO, baby. People want to get out. They've got 35 trillion trapped. They don't they're 65. They don't need eight bedrooms anymore. They're not trying to prove anything to the Jones next door. Their kids are out and they got to hit the market. And when these ele white elephants hit the market all at once, you're going to see some unbelievable opportunities. I'm mark my words, you're going to see houses in California in the next two years that are currently trading at $18 million trade back down to 9 million. That is going to happen. And um no one th this is going to be almost as outlandish as my Baba call, almost out as outlandish as the Intel call, almost as outlandish as the Vornnado call when people were throwing away uh um uh office reats at the worst possible time. Almost as outlandish as the Exxon Mobile call when oil prices turned negative during COVID. almost as outlandish as the Wells Fargo call when it was trading at half a book at $25. Mark my words, you are going to see some of these well white elephants cut in half over the next two years. Goldman says loser land rules may ease US housing squeeze looser land rules.

Incentives is the number one predictor of US volumes. It's a race to the bottom with margins. Uh for the producers of cars, it's a houseian. It's Hian days for the arms dealers, which is the auto parts suppliers. Buyers rush for EVs, giving car makers a needed sales boost. Boeing stock pops as its best salesperson lands another order. aka President Trump. And if you think he can sell Boeing jets, wait till you see how many Intel advanced uh GPUs he's going to sell over the next 24 months. It's going to be insane. It's probably going to be the best return on investment that a taxpayer's ever ever made. Buying Intel at 20 and change and selling it at 100 and change when he leaves office. Boeing has started working on a 737 Max replacement. Um, US government shutdown raises uncertainty but rarely has lasting effect on economy. Does have short-term not lasting. Uh, here's a great interview from Barons. You could check it out at YouTube. We don't have time today. It's 20 minutes with Alex Chris. He said it's a verb across the US. PayPal CEO on Venmo at Barrens. That's with um Andrew Seer who used to be at Yahoo. you know, he's uh running uh baronss and the article of the week, foundation for a comeback, stock market and sentiment results. First off, we want to do an update on Etsy, which we covered on Vanney this morning. Etsy's up big this week. So whether it was PayPal last week with the Google deal or our energy names comtock and national oil wellvarco as co covert AI plays, we continue to focus on the beneficiaries of AI. The way we see it, there are two options. Option one is to own the hyperscalers trading at nosebleleed valuations with decelerating earnings growth who are forced to shell out hundreds of billion of dollars in capex to build AI capabilities while eroding their earnings in the process. Option two is to own the unmagnificent 493 trading at much lower multiples with accelerating earnings and let the hyperscalers pick up the tag tab and drink for free as an AI beneficiary, i.e. capture all the upside without spending a dime. Unlike the rest of the market chasing shiny objects, for us, the choice is a nobrainer. This week, Etsy joins the ranks of Clear AI beneficiaries. The company is partnering with Open AI to give ChatGpt 700 million 700 million plus weekly active users the ability to browse and purchase items through Etsy without leaving the app. Traffic to retail sites from Generative AI has jumped 4,700% over the last year, and this deal positions Etsy at the forefront. ETS's gross merchandise value was already set for an inflection and return to gross. This partnership likely sped it up and can be seen as a cherry on top. Once again, another pick and shovel way to play AI, all while sitting back and letting the hyperscalers do the heavy lifting. Ladies and gentlemen, this is just the beginning. Here's what Barren had to say about the announcement. Open AI users can now shop for Etsy projects products on chat GPT. And sure enough, opinion follows trend. What was a left for dead sleepy name just last week is now on the leading edge of AI and Agentic Commerce. Expect more headlines like this to follow. And the story as the story continues to play out. Quote, "Open AI deal puts Etsy at the leading edge of agentic commerce." BTI says Estee Lauder update. Each week we try to cover one to two companies we have discussed in previous podcast videocasts and or own uh for clients including personally. So we go through the earnings report and all the key highlights. You can read through that on your own time. 10 key points. Estee Lauder reported Q4 revenue of 3.41 41 billion, down 11.9% year-on-year, topping estimates by 10 million with adjusted EPS of 9 cents, beating consensus by 13 cents. For fiscal year 2025, revenue was 14.3 billion, down 8%, landing at the high end of management's prior guidance of down 9% to 8% while adjusted EPS of 151 came in ahead of guidance of 146. Number two, during Q4, SA Ladder gained market share in prestige beauty grant brands across several key markets, including mainland China, Japan, and the US. This is a China recovery play, by the way, with 10 brands growing at retail and driving share gains across every category and channel. In mainland China, share gains were achieved in every category led by continued strength in La Mer and La Labo with brands ranked one or two in the prestige, beauty, and luxury during both the 618 shopping festival and the 11-11 global shopping festival. In Japan, Estee Lauder gained sharing every quarter and strengthened its number one position in fragrance. In the US, the company made meaningful progress throughout the year, returning to market share gains in the second half for the first time in many years. Just go to a Mac store, you see the lines. I mean, six months ago, the place was a ghost town. Now, you walk uh through a MAC, whether it's in the airport or uh locally here in California, and there are people there, which and putting makeup on their face and buying stuff and walking out with bags. It's pretty exciting to see. Three, management continues to lean into higher growth, higher margin digital channels, reducing department store exposure to less than onethird of overall sales. Online sales now account for an all-time high of 31%, up 300 basis points year-on-year and well above 13% in 2018 and the low 20s industry average. During the year, SA Ladder launched eight brands in Amazon's US premium beauty store, expanding its total to 11 with the three brands also on Amazon Canada alongside continued expansion on platforms as Tik Tok Shop, T- Mall, and Shopppee. This expansion drove an acceleration in organic online sales growth from low single digits in the first half to mid-s singledigits in the second half with management expecting this momentum and online mix to continue climbing higher. Four, despite sales declines, management continues to improve margins with fullear adjusted gross margin at 74% up 230 basis points year-on-year and 50 basis points ahead of prior Q3 outlook. Same story by the way with VFC Corp. Margins are improving. This is what you see in every successful turnaround story. For the upcoming year, management expects adjusted gross margin to be flat to positive with a long-term goal of returning to the historical mid70s range. Adjusting operating margin came in at 8% for the full year, down 220 basis points year-on-year due to sales volume delever and increased consumer-facing investments, plus 400 basis points year-on-year. Looking ahead, management expects operating margin to 9.4 to 9.9% in the upcoming year with a medium-term goal of returning to solid double-digit levels in line with the historical mid- teens average. Five, the profit recovery and growth plan PRGP continues to perform ahead of expectations, delivering a 6% reduction in non-consumerfacing costs in fiscal year 2025. Management expects the program to be substantially completed by fiscal year 2027 with the majority of full run rate benefits realized that year. The PRGP is projected to yield annual gross benefits of uh8 or 800 million to a billion dollars against total restructuring and other charges of 1.2 to 1.6. To date, management has already approved initiatives covering more than 60% of expected gross benefits, well ahead of the 50% guidance in 2025, and expects the net reduction in positions of 5,800 to 7,000 with more than 3,200 already completed to be achieved by the end of fiscal year 2026. Six. After three consecutive years of organic sales declines, Estee Lauder expects to return to growth in fiscal 2026. Another characteristic of a successful turnaround story. Uh you saw it already in Advanced Auto Parts. Uh guiding to reported revenue growth of 2 to 5% including a 200 basis points FX tailwind and organic sales growth of up to 3%. The rebound is expected to be led by mids singledigit growth in mainland China, where management is already seeing stabilization and improved customer sentiment alongside modest gains in global travel, retail, and broad-based improvements across all other regions. By year end, management expects all four geographic se segments to be back in positive terri territory. Seven, travel retail. The the segment where prior management got caught off sides during the pandemic continues to decline as a percentage of overall sales. Now representing only 15% of reported sales versus 2021 peak of 29%. The segment remains under pressure down 28% and accounting for roughly 2/3 of Estee Lauder's 8% fullear sales decline. Most importantly, management expects global travel retail to return to modest growth in fiscal 2026 with the key hynen market already turning positive. Eight current tariff mitigation strategies are expected to offset more than half of the impact with management forecasting net tariff related heads wins of 100 million uh 2.6% of cost of sales to fiscal year 2026 profitability. EST ladder maintains the lowest exposure in the industry given its nine manufacturing sites worldwide and continues to elevate additional mitigation strategies including further optimization of its regional manufacturing footprint and pricing opportunities. Nine capital expenditures fell 34% year-onear to 62 million from 919 million as management continues to prioritize returns on capital and free cash flow. With the new Japan factory now complete, capex as a percentage of sales is expected to normalize to 4% down from the 6% average of the past three years. And 10 operating cash flow for the full year came in at 1.27 billion down from 2.6 billion the prior year. This was largely driven by higher restructuring payments which are expected to peak in 2026 and 2020 fiscal year 2024 benefiting from a significant reduction in inventories for 20 fiscal year 2026. Management expects operating cash flow of 1 to 1.1 billion. Estee Lauder's balance sheet remains in solid shape with 2.9 billion in cash as of June 2025 against 7.3 billion in short and long-term debt. Estee ladder sales growth to resume in 2026 on stabilizing China demand. Shares are cheap. That's from um Morning Star with 120 fair value. Like everyone else, opinion will follow trend and they will take the price up as the price exceeds their calls. Here is the earnings call transcript. You can go through that. We've highlighted the important parts as far as sentiment. The fear and greed is at neutral. The AI exposure is at neutral.

For everyone else, stick around to hear from our incredible audience. Starting with Kyle M. Hey Tom, congrats on 300 plus episodes. Huge milestone. Takes a lot of dedication. We all greatly appreciate the effort. Thank you for your support, Kyle. Quick question regarding PayPal. Do you know if the $7 billion buy now pay now later deal with Blue Owl will come to PayPal in a lump sum? It will be over time. It's a two-year deal. It will come in cash. Do you expect material upside in their share repurchases versus the prior plan? I'm sure they will use a significant portion of that for more uh share purchases. However, with Alex Chris, he has a lot of innovation going on. I would like to see him say that while as good as our repurchase returns are at current valuations, we've got business initiatives that have a higher return on invested capital than um buybacks. And I hope they use some of that cash in that way like we've seen with Baba John L. I think the window is going to be closing for them to do buybacks at these valuations pretty quickly. Kyle John L. Um we love buying it here. Uh what do you think about SBC? I I just don't like the business. These cable businesses are kind of left for dead. Oh, well that would have to be if it was a cable business. It's not. So, let's take a look at it. SBC. What the hell? Oh, this is one of these spaxs or something. Medical Group Holdings. This This uh I don't like these type of businesses. These uh this is probably private equity dumping a bunch of things that they overpaid for. Negative free cash flow, revenues declining. What do these things do? Cosmetic treatment centers in Japan, Vietnam. Yeah. No. Hard pass. Next. Johnny S. ICUI. revenue is flat, free cash flow, terrible return on capital. Probably did a dumb deal at some point. My guess is right around here. Uh what do they do? said, "I don't care." Yeah. Let's take a look and see what's the balance sheet look like. 320 million of cash, 1.5 billion of debt. Little bit levered than I would like. Free cash flow positive income statement share account. Uh I think this one's worth exploring more. I kind of like the story. uh it's been consolidating for like 8 years. I would just want to get on eight or 10 calls, understand what did they say would would happen better in the last year, why didn't it happen? Do they have a catalyst? Do they have a new CEO with credibility? Um I think that might be worth doing some more work on, David. Okay. Yeah, we just spoke. I sent you the investment advisory contract, so you're set. Um, Sagar Sagar Kanaka, congratulations and thank you for religiously putting out podcasts every week. Your podcast has become a part of my week and I would be lost without it uh as it is such an important part of mine and a lot of viewers weekly routine. Thank you for that. Thoughts on ESI oil field services for North American international market? laser focus on reducing debt. Let's take a look. There's so many good companies. You don't really have to go down the food chain. I'd rather buy Hallebertton National Oil. Well, Varco SlumberJ US company versus screw around with this. But let's just see. 19 million of debt of cash. 604 million of debt, 215 million of receivables, free cash starting to come back, added a lot of shares. Uh, yeah, I I I I think you can find a better company for your money. So, uh, I'm going to pass. Uh, thanks for sending that in. Abdul Hallebertton, yes, I like it. I like Varco better. Bill Wakefield, please explain Carvana to me. Used car company. Yeah, we're not in it. I I again, it's goes in my too hard pile. I know the guy who controls the stock. Uh, not for me. If I had to be long or short, I'd be short, but I don't have to be involved, so I'm not. Um, Evan M. Devin Energy, it's probably okay, but they're better, higher and better uses of the cash. I'm not ready to go ENTP names on the uh oil side. I don't know that prices are going to come up. I'd rather play the pick and shovels with National Oil Well or the Serers. Um, still free cash flow negative. I I don't like it. There's not enough upside relative to the risk if prices stay lower for a long time. Jack Hazard, Hormell, no change. We've been buying it. Um, Lucas Tangrove covered calls. No, it's a waste of time picking up pennies in front of a steamroller. You're going to give up you're going to pay 30% of tax or depending where you live to get one or 2% of premium income. Waste of time. Uh I'm moving from York UK. CI uh CIVI. This is from Alex Co from the UK. York UK. Thank you for the question. C I V I um anyone who does this to owners should be taken out back and shot. Watch what the shareholder count looks like. Share count. Look at this. 5x the share count. F these guys. Let them rot in hell. Uh, I'll tell you how I feel next week. Next. Land and Worthy. Sure. You get a ton of these. Lulu. Lulu. I keep looking at it every week and I keep doing nothing. We have exposure in discretionary so we don't need to do it. But yeah, I think Lulu is going to work overtime. I think Nike is going to work overtime. I think um VFC Corp is going to give me a much better return and a much better irr. So um I think Lulu's probably okay. Archer Aviation, this is a this is a gambling stock. Um yeah, I mean what else? Like um Landon, welcome to the podcast. You will learn as you go along, but Archer is not uh in the realm of anything we would ever consider. Joel Karen doesn't mean you can't gamble and win. You might buy it and the stock price goes up, but um not what we do. Olga Cladden Kova. Oh, this is spam. Okay. All right. So, Julian Robert says, "Tom, love your content. I've been re-watching your weekly report twice a week for a year now. There's so much to learn. A real Jedi master." Thank you. I'm taking time tonight to vote. Okay. I already have over 10 years of experience trading, but with your stock guidance. I have a 67% performance so far this year. Good job. Uh, I was looking for a sympathy play for Robin Hood. I thought bull would be a potential bagger for the next year. Sock is pretty much flag I uh love to know your advice. I don't care about flags and that kind of but let me just see what's going on here as a business. Yeah, they seem to be accelerating. Um, what is the 105 times next year's earnings, 10 times book? What are sales? $7 billion market cap on a billion dollars of sales. seven times sales. I mean, they have growth. I I don't I don't like this is just a spec play. If you want to trade and gamble, it'll work until it doesn't. Um, that's not what we do here. Uh, I'm not saying it's good or bad. It's just not what we do here. Okay, Tim D. Yeah, I got that. Oh, Jeet's asking about involution in China. Um, they're just trying to stop the price wars with a lot of different things. It's it's going to benefit. I mean, it that was initially related to um delivery services and it spread out into uh taking down mines and over capacity. Basically, the race to the bottom has to stop. Companies have to make margin. government kind of figured that out. Uh Simon Stazziness question for podcast. Hi Tom. Been watching for almost a year and as markets fanatic I have to admit it's better than Netflix. Okay. Uh uh you only get one not two. So let's put this one out. We'll get the American one. C Z MWF. All right. So, that's not even a thing. So, let's take your German one is a FF X. Margins are compressing. Revenues seem to be okay. Free cash flow. Okay. Um, 22,649 million of receivables. 400 million of debt. That's fine. free cash flow steady trying to invested capital's decline that might be related to uh share account steady what do they to medical technology, opthalmology, and micro surgery, chronic eye diseases. Yeah, I think this one's probably worth doing some work on. I wouldn't be interested, but um think it's okay. Jim Griffin. My wife, this is Jim Griffin. My wife and I went to a bank trustee meeting and he was pushing Bloom Energy saying it was his AI play. It's already had a great run and doesn't look like a turnaround play. What are your thoughts on this company? Uh, I think you answered your own question. I mean, these salespeople, it's like, thanks. Where were you at $8? Now you want to give it to me at 88 like um Okay, Bob Buyers, what's your target price for Intel? A lot higher, Bob. You can go through all the podcasts and listen covered it today as well. Um I'm sitting at $40 based on a DCF. This has nothing to do with DCF. Like, how could you even extrapolate a DCF when you don't know what the business is going to look like 2 years from now? So, um, anyway, I've I've gone through the the three key scenarios. We've taken one off the table, which is liquidation. Now, we're at can the old business work, and the answer is yes. Um, so that's worth 40 45 bucks. And then can the advanced production work? And now they're getting clients. So in which case this is a tripledigit stock at some point. Uh feel free to take some uh off across the table. You did a ask about biomarin. We agree. I think it looks pretty interesting here. Um let's take a look from Mark S. Hey Tom, undergrad student here learning about efficient frontier sharp ratios cappen DCF time value money principles of finance type course. What if any you use the most in daytoday market analysis stock analysis is some of this stuff garbage? I recall you saying sharp ratios were what consultants use? Cheers. You got to learn it all and Mark you'll find out over a career what what is useful to you and what's not. Um, I would say my best advice to you is when buying a share of stock, underwrite it as if you were going to buy the entire business with 100% of your net worth. And if you wouldn't put up 100% of your net worth into taking the company private, then you shouldn't buy one share of stock. Um, and that will answer what you need to know about efficient frontier and sharp ratios and all this useless stuff that you have to learn but serve no practical purpose in real life. Um, luth fsa L. Okay. Lanza from Lee Foster. 8.7 billion of cash, 9 billion of debt. share count. It's more than doubled, almost tripled since COVID. So, they just screwed all their shareholders. So, I mean, you have triple the share count and the peak share price before they tripled the count was 34 when everything was hitting on all cylinders. So, it's effectively at $34 now based on the share count. So, I mean, unless you think the business is going to be twice as good as it was seven years ago when things were perfect, this is this is a pass. Um, Jimmy Jones, can you explain your thought process on when you buy up? We never buy up ever. So, if we have new money come in and a great stock is pulled back, pulled back a lot, um, yeah, we might put new money to work, but we're never chasing up ever. We rarely even buy on a day that the market is green unless the stock is down a lot. opinion on Under Armour train wreck. Um Gabrielle Sanchez, Mission Technology Solutions. Send me a ticker next time. I don't know what what that is. Um, Carmen Quac, Common Quac, thank you for sharing. I've been listening to your podcast for three years. Wow. Thank you very much. Hello. Wow. Check this out. Common Quac, thank you, Tom, for your sharing. Have been listening to your podcast for three years and I am now a millionaire at 35 because of you. Wow, that is exciting. Um, ignoring your stance on the Mag 7. Now, what do you think of Amazon? Um, wow, man. Congratulations. That is super exciting. Job well done. Um, I mean, if you put a gun to my head and said, "Buy some of the mag seven I'd buy Amazon and Google." But um I I think it's okay. I I just think it's a bad use of capital. There's so many higher and better uses. I think you won't get hurt, but I don't think you're going to make a lot of money in the next two years. Eric Bour. Thank you, Tom, for sharing your work.

Evan Chen, uh, thoughts on Adobe and Regeneron? Adobe, I can't handicap how hurt they're going to be by, um, AI, disintermediating them. Uh, Regeneron, we like, we've covered that. Robert Wart Buffett is betting on Japan. What do you think about that? I have no interest in Japan. Good for Buffett. Mitch Limb uh using I want to pick your brain on turnarounds in general using PayPal as an example. I understand the underlying thesis of the investment cheap business high normalized growth proven leadership team. Based on Alex Chris guidance, it seems like PayPal is changing their business model to one that is more of an e-commerce platform with an advertising business rather than sle payments platform. How do you think about companies that need to change their business model in order to get back to growth? They all have to change something. I mean, Advanced Auto Parts had to change their distribution hubs and normalize the business. It got fat and happy just like PayPal. So, you got to lean down and then you got to initiate growth. They're not changing their business model. They're adding a huge uh profit center like Amazon did. They didn't change their business when they added advertising on Amazon.com. It just enhanced it and dramatically increased the profitability. So, I I don't think that's a fair way to characterize it, but I'm very very happy with what Alex Chris is doing to uh to bring them back to growth. So, um it's not a cookie cutter answer. Everything is a case- by case basis. What's what matters for Advanced Auto Parts is very different than what matters for PayPal is very different from what mattered for Vernado was very different from what mattered for Exxon Mobile which is very different from what mattered for Alibaba etc. Um Leon Quinn thanks for everything you do for Hedge fun tips community. I'm new here and I have a question about selling stocks. Uh, how do you sell stocks all at once or in stepped in phases? If in step something like steps one, sell a portion of recoup. Step two, no, none of this. It all depends. We we know we underwrite fair value of the business before we even buy one share. We know where we're getting out before we get in. Depending on the level of risk in that execution, we may take off certain tanches on the way up. Um uh and sometimes we'll leave a little tail uh even after we've reached full value and made all of our money. But usually we we leave a little tail and then we're kind of done with it. We don't want to look at a stub forever and we just we're out because it got to where we thought it would get two or three years earlier. We've made our multibagger and we take the money and move on. We leave the last 10% for someone else. Um, but no, we don't think about it like a, you know, gambling day trader with stop losses and this and that. That's We do private equity in public markets. We underwrite the entire business. We make sure we buy it at a huge price with a a great price with a huge margin of safety. And then we play the time arbitrage game. And while everyone's responding to ridiculous headlines, we just watch management execute. And if they do what they said they're going to do, we continue to hold the stock. If it goes lower, we buy more. Uh, and then when it hits our intrinsic value, we sell and and that's that's how we operate. Um, but we all battles are won before all all wars are won before the first battle is fought. We know where we're getting out before we ever get in. Um, okay. Got that. Tom, first of all, thank you for the pod. This is from Rory Mroy. Thanks, Rory. Congratulations on the win at the Ryder Cup. Uh, first of all, thank you for your podcast that over the years has been a constant source of knowledge, wisdom, and brought in an entertaining way. Now, as a play on the energy market, I came across HBR in London, Harbor Energy, and I like their business approach. M&A rollups a bit like QXO without the Brad Jacobs. By the way, lot anyone can do a rollup. Very few can do it well. Free capsule seems on the up and up with writes a book about one. Can you give me your insights? Uh, where? Let's see. All right. So, what is this called? Harbor Energy. This looks like a bunch of scumbags. Also, how can you destroy that much equity? Let's take a look. Got to work seven days a week to destroy that much value. All right. So, they brought the share count from 5 million shares to a billion shares. These people should be taken out back and strung up in a tree. These are scumbags. Uh, and there's a cancer in the organization. I want nothing to do with that. Um, so next week, Rory will tell you how I really feel, but um, thank you for sending in the question. Muel Art Artita Purple, it's a mattress turnaround play on lowering interest rates. P RPL. I think it's one of these like rollup mattresses, which is a fad. Still free cash flow negative, revenues declining. There's nothing turning around here, so I would say pass. Alex Zerk, hey Tom, current undergrad at a well-known semational level school, solid business program, but no way are we competing with the Ivys. Is it worth exploring an MBA immediately after undergrad or waiting? I see so many applications with notes in the job description saying MBA candidates. Depends what you're going. If you want to run a business, get your MBA. If you want to uh like a big company, be a C public company CEO one day, you have to have an MBA. If you um want to get into the investment business, probably a CFA is more useful. Um, I would just forget all that and start a business, fail a couple times in your 20s, make 10 20 by the time you're 35, and then by the time you're 50, you're probably worth 100 plus and call it a day. So, um, but, uh, usually MBA, you want to get a couple years of work experience before you do that, uh, and make that investment because you could spend 200,000 on an MBA and still not be able to get a job. So you you need to learn how to ne network and hustle and get yourself in the door and being willing to you know mop the floors if you have to just to get your foot in the door and then prove your value and uh uh value is sooner or later will be compensated uh if you continue to give before you expect anything in return. Great things happen sooner or later or you just take your value elsewhere. G E HC. I think it's going to be a slowish. It's going to be fine. I actually kind of like this. But see, two Did they stick a lot of debt with the spin? 7 billion. Yeah, they put a little debt on it. Let's see the free cash flow. 5 billion. Uh, I kind of like this one, Alejandro. Let's see here. Yeah, I kind of like this one. GE Healthcare. That might be worth looking into. Good job, Alejandra. Um, I think we got it. All right. Uh yeah, we got them all. So, we'll be back next week, same time, same place. In the meantime, make it a great one. Bye for now. [Music] Heat. Heat. [Music] [Music] [Music]
