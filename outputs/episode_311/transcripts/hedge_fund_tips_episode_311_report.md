**Tom's Current Market Conviction: Cautiously Bullish → 7/10** 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥☆☆☆

- Short-term market chop expected due to earnings season and potential government shutdown.
- Long-term bullish on small caps and undervalued sectors like healthcare and energy.
- Believes the Fed will eventually cut rates, providing a boost to the market.

## Macro Thesis & Key Data Points
The market is poised for a rotation from the MAG 7 to small caps and undervalued sectors. Healthcare and energy offer generational opportunities due to low relative valuations and favorable four-year cycle trends. Lower interest rates and increased government spending will provide further tailwinds. Be patient and aggressive when the time is right.

|-----------|-------|----------------------|
| Energy Sector Earnings Growth | 17% next year | Energy sector trading at 15.2 times earnings, compared to the S&P 500 at 22 times, is poised for significant growth, driven by data center demand and low weighting in the S&P. |
| Healthcare Sector Relative Valuation | Lowest relative valuation to the S&P in 100 years | Healthcare sector presents a four times in a 100-year opportunity to buy, especially in the current four-year presidential cycle. |
| US SAR New Sales | 16.1 million baseline | Strong auto sales data is positive for Cooper Standard. |
| China A-Shares Retail Sentiment Proxy | Elevated but nowhere near maxed out | Indicates potential for further institutional buying into Chinese equities. |
| 30-Year Mortgage Rate | 6.33% with implied rate of 5.58% | Lower rates will unlock housing supply and create buying opportunities. |
| Defensives Market Cap Weighting | Lowest since 2000 | Presents a buying opportunity in healthcare, consumer staples, and REITs. |
| University of Michigan Consumer Sentiment Index | Washout Magnitude | Markets are up 24% on average after a consumer sentiment washout of this magnitude. |
