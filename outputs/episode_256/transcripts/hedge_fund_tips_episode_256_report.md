- S&P 500 members outperforming the S&P 500, similar to early 2000s.
- Potential for international stocks and emerging markets to outperform.
- Expectation of strength into the first rate cut.

## Macro Thesis & Key Data Points
The market is transitioning from a period of large-cap growth outperformance to one where value, small caps, and international stocks will lead. The Fed's easing cycle will further fuel this rotation. Despite concerns about a potential recession, data suggests the economy is in the early stages of an expansion. International equities are poised to outperform US equities, and Chinese equities present a generational buying opportunity.

| German Factory Orders | Unexpectedly increased for the second month | Suggests a re-acceleration of the German economy, supporting the narrative for international stock outperformance. |
| Leading Indicators | Already troughed | A strong signal that the recession everyone was waiting for already happened in the first half of 2022 and we are now in an expansion. |
| Chinese Real Estate B Stocks | Back to 2008 lows | Presents a generational buying opportunity in high-quality Chinese businesses. |
| International Price to Earnings Discount vs US | Trading at two standard deviations lower than the average of its relationship to the S&P 500 PE ratio | International equities are poised to dramatically outperform the US over the next 5-10 years. |
