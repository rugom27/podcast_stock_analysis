  "cleaned_transcript": "welcome to hedge fun tips with Tom Hayes I&#39;m Tom Hayes and this is your 256 podcast video cast for the weekending September 12th 2024 a lot of great stuff to cover today so we&#39;ll get right down to it family first then business uh got to spend a extended weekend uh Friday through or Thursday night through Monday in Orange County with the girls and my wife they&#39;re out there uh training for water polo and swimming uh pretty pretty exciting stuff by the way they&#39;re training with uh well we&#39;ll get into that a second uh so that&#39;s a picture I believe in Huntington Beach and that definitely is the Huntington Beach Pier at night which was a lot of fun and then of course I did some Channel checks this was so wild the culture of Vans now In fairness Huntington Beach is Surf City where so there&#39;s a lot of skateboarders so everyone is wearing Vans which was you know very nice as a a nice size owner of VF Corp uh but it wasn&#39;t just that they had Vans I I looked at this store they had vans on roller skates and I thought this was just kind of like a concept until I went down to the beach and I saw people roller skating with Vans roller skates which is must just be a Huntington Beach thing but I was pretty blown away that&#39;s the girls at dinner one night that&#39;s them doing their uh homeschooling during the day in between water polo and swimming that&#39;s me at the Van store in um I think Fountain Valley and I was talking to star who was an amazing host at the store a worker at the store about all the stuff and she said that these new schools are selling so fast for back to school that they were actually out of stock it sold so much faster than they could have possibly anticipated they had to wait uh to get more in and they did in time for school and they were able to meet the demand but she says these black and white new schools are through the roof and then she went through a couple of the other newer ones that we&#39;ve covered on past calls and I said you know she&#39;s been there for four years I said so is this year slower than last year she said no uh just the opposite this has been the fastest uh busiest 6 months since I&#39;ve been here uh it&#39;s really really picking up so you know that&#39;s anecdotal but uh confirmatory from what I saw in New York this is Mimi with Maggie stefins uh she is um three-time gold medalist for water polo she has the record for the most goals scored by an individual woman in water polo that is an olympic record so she&#39;s training with her and she&#39;s training with Tony oovo who&#39;s a five time Olympian was the captain of the Olympic team silver medalist and um fourth in goals of all time for an individual in the men&#39;s sport with 61 goals uh during his Olympic career which is just mindboggling uh was also led the Stanford team to Greatness as well as I I believe Maggie stepin played for Stanford as well uh so that&#39;s what they&#39;re doing out there working hard that&#39;s uh Annabelle goofing around with Caitlyn uh on The Babys set they&#39;ll always be babies in my eye that that&#39;s us at the beach Caitlyn and I so that was a fun few days I will be on vanney and Company on Tuesday morning so tune in if you&#39;re free usually I&#39;m on the 10:00 a.m. or 11:00 a.m. hour right at the turn of the hour uh and then I will be on Cavuto Coast to Coast on Wednesday also in studio so tune in at 12:00 p.m. for that got a lot of stuff to cover today so let&#39;s get right up to it uh this is job opening so all of this is pointing to job openings we&#39;ve covered all the data we like to be data driven um is pointing to the the 25 basis point cut the owner&#39;s equivalent rent which will get into spiked up again so that&#39;s going to limit the cut to 25 versus 50 which I think is a good thing I think if the first cut comes out at 50 it would spook the market a little bit they have not set up the market for a 50 uh timos has been talking 25 I think that&#39;s the way to go and then maybe do 50 and or 25 25 and then 50 right after the election in December get in 100 I think the Market&#39;s pricing in 125 bips uh before the end of the year that&#39;s probably too much I think it&#39;s going to be 75 or 100 and all this points towards it uh job openings inflation expectations uh this was interesting German Factory orders un expectantly increased for the second month German&#39;s been slowing it seems like it&#39;s starting to re accelerate and then you had the ECB also cut rates again this morning so again that that narrative for international stocks starting to take the torch I think we&#39;re going to see that not only in emerging markets in China uh but also Europe start to see some level of outperformance we&#39;ve seen that the green shoots with the UK in recent months and uh I think we&#39;re going to see that elsewhere moving right along we have uh S&amp;P 500 members outperforming the S&amp;P 500 in the trailing 12 2 months that is getting back to the levels uh that we haven&#39;t seen since the early 2000s and again going back to 2001 which we&#39;ve covered many times in recent weeks and months as an analog uh that&#39;s when you had Emerging Markets small caps value uh and international and dividend pairs all outperform 2002 to 2007 so another confirmatory indicator pointing towards that uh leading indicators already trough this is a big deal this is not the kind of thing you see turn up before a recession it&#39;s what you see turn up after a recession and we&#39;ve been one of the few voices on the street that&#39;s been telling you since early 2022 when we had two quarters of negative GDP growth consecutively that the recession everyone was waiting for already happened in the first half of 2022 and that&#39;s why everyone who was telling you about triple break putts and how how the world was going to hell in a hand basket and we were buying like there was no like it was going out of business in Fall of 2022 when everyone was selling in the whole uh this is why ladies and gentlemen so these are the type of data points that you see that don&#39;t point to a recession if anything they they point to the beginning of an expansion and those things that outperform which we&#39;ll discuss um each one percentage Point change in the statutory domestic tax rate would shift earnings per share by slightly less than 1% so this is what so you know in theory if Kam got in and increased the capital gains tax to 28% in theory you&#39;re looking at you know 700 bit basis points decline uh of earnings so you&#39;d have basically your earnings growth would be cut in a half for next year that&#39;s assuming she could get it through which again what does the market left like and need it likes and needs gridlocks so regardless of who wins the presidency uh who ever as long as one party does not get the power in the House and Senate as well as the presidency these type of dramatic changes are unlikely to be implemented uh next let&#39;s see here uh expensive relative to the last 10 years those two groups that are the least expensive are uh S&amp;P 400 which is midcaps and S&amp;P 600 which is small cap so again another theme we&#39;ve been covering this is the US regime&#39;s heuristic um value small size and high-risk tend to farewell in a recovery that is our base case this is what looked like in 20012 2002 um and what you saw in recency bias was the high quality lowrisk large size IE mag 7 outperformed phase 4 right before phase one where value small small size and high risk really start to outperform so I think that&#39;s where we are right now you&#39;ve seen the mag 7 come off the boil a little bit you started to see these perk up I think after the FED Cuts that&#39;s got going to persist and expand over the next 12 to 18 months and we&#39;re positioned for that um this also talks about relative sector and Industry value valuations with energy showing the greatest upside on the basis of Price to Book uh as a matter of fact three price to operating cash flow and forward PE those showing the lowest upside or negative upside Information Technology all this data is from Bank of America Based on data from 1986 to 2024 on a dividend yield basis real estate looks like it has the most upside on a buyback basis financials look like they have the most upside on a trailing PE basis energy looks like it has the most upside uh least upside on a dividend yield basis is communication Services least upside on a buyback basis is information technology and least upside on a trailing PE basis is information technology Enterprise Value to sales most upside is financials least upside is information technology um uh Enterprise Value to eida most upside energy least upside information technology and Enterprise Value to free cash flow most upside energy least upside information technology so across nine metrics what you&#39;re seeing is in Information Technology having negative upside relative to 40 Years of History um and again you know we kind of have been pounding the table on this and it&#39;s actually played out and we&#39;ll continue to play out but what we&#39;ve also caveat this with was this does not have to be 2000 to 2001 where Tech would crash it could simply mean they stop their relative outperformance and may have underperformance so what does that mean in English it could mean the indices are up 10% mag 7&#39;s Up 3 to 5% and some of the Left for Dead small caps are up 50 and 100% uh on an individual basis and uh and emerging markets and so on and so forth so there&#39;s a lot to be said there um the yield curve is suggesting higher Vicks for years to come um that is also an environment that we saw again in 2002 to 20 7 when uh Emerging Markets International small caps dividend pairs Etc outperformed Tech uh large cap growth quality dramatically underperformed and that happens after periods when they outperform and you can see it again one more indicator Chinese real estate B stocks back to 2008 lows uh that for me and the last time you saw before that was actually 2001 so I don&#39;t know how you look at something like this and say that this time is different like nothing almost nothing could be worse than the great financial crisis which was basically the modern day equivalent of the Great Depression with policy tools that ameliorated the effect uh from a you know 10year effect to a 2-year effect but leaving that aside is those people who took advantage of those rare once in 100y year opportunities you know made made fortunes you know whether it was uh the Ken Joe Kennedy whether it was the Rockefellers whether it was the Vanderbilts you name it uh people who step in when there are these generational opportunities am I saying to go buy skyscrapers in China no your property right rights might not be protected but what I am saying is if you bought highquality durable businesses in China or or the hangang index for instance which is you know wait which is basically Alibaba and 10 cent uh as an ETF um you did extremely well coming out of these periods that everyone said nothing would change as a matter of fact um a writer from Bloomberg asked me for my comments on it and like you know he was basically saying like we&#39;ve never seen anything like this and I said to him yeah except for I don&#39;t know every 4 years for the last 25 years and I sent him this chart that we&#39;ve used in the vid videoast podcast uh a couple of weeks ago and you know the fact of the matter is it&#39;s China so every four years you see these once in a lifetime once in a generation catastrophic crashes that always resolve to the to side and this time will be no different uh whether it was 1995 and you know you crashed from uh 14,000 to 6,000 50% crash and then you went up 200% from you know 95 to 98 and then guess what you crashed again a 70% crash this is the Hang sang which is basically chin Tech and then from 98 back to 2000 you again tripled up 20 200% and then guess what you crashed 75% in 2000 to 2003 and then guess what after putting in a 2-year base you had the biggest rally ever 4X 300% over the next 5 years from 2003 to 2007 then guess what you crashed another 70% crash in 2008 then guess what you doubled in a half this literally happens every four years you can set your clock by it and people are thinking this time is different look it takes with the exception of 2009 okay 2008 and 2009 it only took a year to put in the bottom okay every other time it took at least two a year and a half two years uh and the big ones like 2001 to 2004 2003 it took two and a half years so we&#39;re on let&#39;s see 2020 end of 2022 and here we are at the end of 2024 so less than two years and then sure enough you get the recovery and things are Off to the Races so uh this time is different no it literally 24 years so you&#39;re looking at since 1994 uh 30 years you&#39;ve had this happen 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 8 * 4 is 32 every four years the the Hang say Chinese equities collapse more than 50% and within the next few years they go on to make new highs and um so you can bet that this time will be different you can say no way I want to become a Rockefeller or Joe Kennedy or Vanderbilt or anyone who took advantage and created these generational fortunes when other people were running for the hills because you&#39;re impatient or you&#39;re on Leverage um but uh I I just love seeing charts like this this this is what this is why I skip to work every day I literally feel like I&#39;m going to a treasure hunt and I&#39;m looking for these rare opportunities where you can buy stuff quality assets that are totally marked down right at or near the inflection and at or near the inflection could be a year it could be two years who cares uh when you&#39;re talking about double triple quadruples the key is at the end of the duration what was your irr and um usually the longer it takes to build the base like in by the way this is probably the most important message of this week&#39;s call is uh where did I put that there it is the the longest base that we saw was after the 2000 Crash from 18,300 down to 8300 um so about 60% crash it took from mid 2001 to Mid 2003 so late 2003 so just over two years to put in that base and then you had but because it was the longest base you also had the highest recovery uh of 8,000 to 32,000 so for forx 300% gain because the base took longer to build and here you had the bottom at late 2022 and then the second bottom in early 2024 we have not retested that yet so the bottom we believe is in this is one of these fake out after the first move up you get this check back like we had and now move higher uh so we&#39;re in the middle of that recovery and I think that&#39;s going to continue so and I think because the base took so long to build I think we&#39;re on the cusp of one of the biggest moves in the in a reasonably short period of time and I do think also it will probably be the last parabolic move in China based on age and demographics uh largest weekly outflow from energy funds since June 2023 I think that&#39;s uh signaling to us it&#39;s time to be looking more aggressively at energy we are comfortable with our position with com stock resources a number of you have been sending me some integrad but they&#39;ve already moved so much and they actually haven&#39;t dropped in concert with the underlying so I don&#39;t see big upside but I am looking at some of the servicers I am looking at some of the refiners and some of the more beaten down uh uh companies that have actually Fallen with the price of energy uh that could be potential opportunities in addition to Comstock but I don&#39;t you know with a concentrated portfolio I don&#39;t really need or want two major energy positions but I&#39;ll be open-minded if it&#39;s a fat pitch down the middle bull bear indicator is not yet extreme at extreme bullishness so that&#39;s why I continue to think it&#39;s it feels like it&#39;s been delayed but now it&#39;s picking up a little bit of life is the uh our expectation based on all the seasonality we&#39;ve discussed in recent weeks whether it&#39;s election seasonality first cut seasonality Etc was that we&#39;d get some strength and maybe knock on the door to new highs prior to the first cut suck everyone in into the market and then uh put on some tactical shorts in in anticipation of the pre-election jitters uh from the last week of September through the last week of October that may be actually playing out we had a major reversal yesterday uh bullish engulfing for all of you candle followers uh if that means anything that uh could yield that for the next you know six to eight trading sessions into that cut and maybe a little bit beyond uh if we get at our close new to new High but as far as hedging out the book I mean um everything that had froth that we made a lot of money in we harvested and we talked about that in late June and early July with mag 7 before those rolled over and the banks and uh and everything else so we&#39;ll look potentially to buy those back lower in October if the opportunity presents itself this is an interesting I don&#39;t know why this jobs report chart keeps repeating every single page there must be some glitch but uh this chart from Bank of America shows the Divergence be between luxury spending and uh lower income spending so this started to diver diverge in 2023 and it shows how Dollar General has collapsed and Ferrari has gone to the Moon uh I think and we&#39;re going to talk about some of these consumer discretionary stocks are getting exceptionally cheap and near inflections and and that&#39;s interesting because all the stocks that have been on my radar um or that we have been able to take advantage of are oddly consumer discretionary because they&#39;ve gotten extremely cheap so whether it&#39;s not a position and it&#39;s on our radar like Lulu uh which I spent some time at the store and watch my girls spend I got to I got to be honest with you I walked through Lululemon there was nothing I wanted to buy but you know whatever um you know I&#39;m probably not their target market but it really kind of felt to me it felt like the Gap I mean the stuff seemed Bland and boring and dull um now women will tell you but you know and I&#39;m just talking generally I&#39;m not talking about young people but I&#39;m just talking generally like Housewives will say well you know it makes my whatever it makes me look good yada yty I don&#39;t know they&#39;ve acknowledged that they they&#39;ve got boring stuff I think that&#39;s going to be an interesting turnaround situation but I don&#39;t know if the margin sa of safety is good enough you know another one that&#39;s on my radar again consumer discretionary that&#39;s just gotten extremely cheap is Etsy uh again I haven&#39;t done anything with that Nike by the way I mean you know I bought Vans because we own BF Corp so we already have consumer discretionary but I got to play stanwich next week which is like for those of you who don&#39;t play golf is an it&#39;s the best Club in Stanford and in uh in Connecticut and arguably like the east coast and stanwich greens are so special and fast that I got a note like you can&#39;t bring your normal spikes even though they&#39;re not real spikes anymore you got to buy spikeless golf shoes so I I went on and got these Air Jordans which are sick by the way and what&#39;s great about these is when I go out to visit in the kids in California I can wear these on the plane and then go play golf with them um so Nike is putting out some really great products I think Nike is I think Nike&#39;s more interesting and the reason I didn&#39;t jump on it one I already have Vans and two I already have China exposure which is basically what what Nike is but at some point it becomes so compelling we&#39;ll have to act it&#39;s just not today uh next August is surprisingly strong but beware of September and October so this shows monthly performance in election years from 20 uh 1950 to 2023 September down 4/10 of a% October down 7/10 of a% um and then you got a huge Rebound in November plus 2% and December plus 1.3% moving on International price to earnings discount versus the United States international stocks all world country index us is they&#39;re um trading at two standard deviations lower than the average of its relationship to the S&amp;P 500 PE ratio so two standard deviations that that is an extreme and what we know uh is that it runs in in both directions and the the last time it got two standard deviations above was 2010 and what happened for the next 10 years it dramatically underperformed the US so when International PE was two standard deviations above its long-term average the next 10 years it dramatically underperformed the US and now it&#39;s two standard deviations below its historic average I I I&#39;m willing to bet that the next 10 years International certainly the next five I don&#39;t really care about the next 10 International dramatically outperforms the us and you&#39;re like no way us exceptionalism blah blah blah look I&#39;m all for us exceptionalism I I&#39;ll wave the biggest flag on top of my house that you&#39;ve ever seen but um when it comes to making money I leave the idealism aside and I Look to what the data tells me and that&#39;s what the data tells me so um just remember you know turn around Tom&#39;s L than of the day when you buy a stock or a company or or a concept two standard deviations away from its mean if it&#39;s down 80% 90% you know if you buy it down 80% it can go down 90% which means a temporary 50% Mark tomarket loss before it becomes a four bagger and that&#39;s the difference you know one of our\n\n### MACRO_DATA_SLIDES\nnext August is surprisingly strong but beware of September and October so this shows monthly performance in election years from 20 uh 1950 to 2023 September down 4/10 of a% October down 7/10 of a% um and then you got a huge Rebound in November plus 2% and December plus 1.3% moving on International price to earnings discount versus the United States

below its historic average I I I'm willing to bet that the next 10 years International certainly the next five I don't really care about the next 10 International dramatically outperforms the us and you're like no way us exceptionalism blah blah blah look I'm all for us exceptionalism I I'll wave the biggest flag on top of my house that you've ever seen but um when it comes to making money I leave the idealism aside and I Look to what the data tells me and that's what the data tells me so um just remember you know turn around Tom's L than of the day when you buy a stock or a company or or a concept two standard deviations away from its mean if it's down 80% 90% you know if you buy it down 80% it can go down 90% which means a temporary 50% Mark tomarket loss before it becomes a four bagger and that's the difference you know one of our\n### QUOTES_OF_THE_WEEK\nquotes of the week\n\n### QUOTES_OF_THE_WEEK\n\npeople are intending that the Fed easing cycle terminal rate will be at 290 I'll believe it when I see it I think they might get down to 350 and be good enough there because just as they're coming down inflation's going to be more volatile than they expect and we've been saying this for a while they've got to let inflation run above 3% for 3 to 5 years to bring down debt to GDP that's the only way they're going to do it just like they did post World War two when debt to GDP also ran 120% debt to GDP\n### HEADLINES_AND_NEWS\nnext Chinese economy-wide prices in longest decline since 1999 so I guess a lot of people see this and they say don't invest in China I see this and I look at every single time you've had this level of price decline was a generational opportunity to earn outsized excess returns by buying Chinese equities so that's just how I'm wired and if you go back and you look at all these instances you're going to see the exact same thing um unless you believe day doesn't follow night and it will be night forever uh and um so far we just haven't found that in any instance of history but uh maybe this will be the first time but the the way I always think about these things is the world only ends once and um and if and if this is the time you have a lot more to worry about than your stock portfolio so I I'll leave it at that I mean there's no way that China collapses and the rest of the world you know I had a friend who passed away and he used to say uh when the US catches a cold Europe gets AIDS I he was trying you know he was trying to get a point across uh I think it's a simp situation uh yes us is strong to stand on its own but if China really caught an aggressive cold there's no way we don't at least get a flu uh in that environment so so the point is that these become opportunities day follows night etc etc uh 10year Break Even rate is at the lowest ever 2.0 so we know the cuts are happening TSA passenger volumes continue to increase above 20 19 levels you can see the data here well above it and continue to do that that's great for Boeing that's the only reason I bring that up uh China's CPI actually ticked up that's that's not looking that's looking less like deflation so the year onye next is China CPI year on-ear food is is coming up all these things are positive that means their rates will start to come up that means their currency will start to come up and uh all the things that we want to see there uh percent of unprofitable companies you know the big case that you see people making against small caps is that oh 41% of them are unprofitable well that has always been the case right before they have their biggest rallies why because they do their best after the first fed cut and what that means is these unprofitable companies the number one thing they need is cheap capital in the debt and Equity markets and that's a function of lowering rates and that's when these things absolutely take off so the fact so when people say well they can't do well because 41% are unprofitable look at the last four times that they did well uh you had instances where a higher percentage or an equal percentage in the case of the early 2000s uh were unprofitable and that that was at the beginning of the easing cycle and then they took off while the large quality uh took a a a long back seat uh okay mag 7 we already covered that this is from Matt sermino I think he works for Tom Lee below our historical uninversity average one-year forward Total return is plus 16.6% uh four out of six stocks ended higher a more balanced picture for those saying the yield curve uninversity recently had and coming out of that you had that uninversity [Music] yourarf out is the last couple examples was 2019 before covid and the great financial crisis so they say oh only bad things can happen but what they're missing is the demographics in the background that are more similar to the baby boom uh we had in the early 80s that led to 20 years of prosperity uh versus the Gen X um uh kind of um demographic pothole that we had in 2000 and 2008 My Generation only had 65 million people relative to the Boomers who had 80 and the Millennials now have uh a big generation so so that demand like you saw in the early 80s is going to be similar to right now so that uninversity very good things uh increase in volatility from July to November of presidential election years and then it peaks in November and comes right back down that's what we're seeing now uh yield curve suggests higher vix for years we covered that overweight consumer discretionary real wage growth is positive okay so consumer discretionary companies like Vans like uh you know Nike like Lulu like um all these things and even Amazon I'll say even though we took profits on Amazon because we had such a huge run from Fall of 2022 buying in the hole in March of 2023 we rang the register on that but I think a lot of discretionary are going to start doing well against all consensus as these Cuts kick in and lower people's interest rates and credit card bills and all that stuff uh and the consumer is so relatively delevered from the great financial crisis there's so much room for them to relever it's astounding um consumer discretionary has historically outperformed following the tightening Cycles okay and then um you see discretionary versus S&P 500 you have the tightening cycle that ends and then they start to outperform and that's where we are right now so we're going to continue to look for more opportunities in discretionary as well we we've already got a number of them we've got goose is a smaller position we've got uh VF cor we've got a number of others as well uh the destocking cycle which is which has been the theme why has this been so important well everything that we bought in the hole is working like crazy because the dstock to restock like your gener up uh basically double off the lows like your Stanley Black and&amp; Decker just coming out of the hole uh Etc so we're going to see more of that and uh believe it or not we're going to see a similar situation in Intel I know that one's a controversial one we're going to cover a number of things on that this week we did a major one on that about two three weeks ago after the earnings call so go back and look at that we're not going to do a whole another hour on that uh nothing has really changed other than that they're going to get a little liquidity they'll sell off Mobil ey they'll sell off uh this other uh big and unnecessary division that was bought right before Ginger came in they paid for both of them at 15 billion they'll probably sell them for 7 billion raise some cash not do the German Factor Factory all these other things will kick into gear the government will be forced to give them the money that they promised them and then all of a sudden you got a$ 30 and $40 stock and then we figure out is it really going to be worth 60 to 100 or do we take the profits again in the high 40s and call it a day uh we'll see where it is then but I would not bet against it so next uh Equity performance in different interest rate environments International equities and value uh percent value percent growth okay so when you have a value International tilt they do best in a 4 to 5% range um that's when they do best relative to us equities I think we're going you know to four pretty quick and whether we go a lot lower than that uh I think remains to be seen and and and if we do go lower than that it will be over a longer period of time so again the next 12 to 24 months favors that positioning next is now this is interesting the August 2024 rent growth is flowing year on-year according to Bank of America internal data yet the owner's equivalent rent spiked up this month so again that's a a constant push and pull We Believe owner equivalent uh rent contined to moderate after an unexpected Rebound in July it didn't uh which is why you're getting 25 basis points versus 50 next week uh Japanese Yen continues to roll over I think the right after the fed Cuts you're going to see the bank of Japan hike which is going to create a little more turbulence for the mag 7 again in October why because the carry trade is going to continue to unwind which was borrowing for effectively free and using that money to buy the mag 7 so as the bank of Japan hikes and uh um and people uh come out of that trade they're going they're the The Leverage is going to come out of the mag s so I think we're going to see continued volatility to mag s at least till late October uh that is I caveat that by I think the next week and a half into the cuts I think they could rip rip higher as a fake out um before this happens and then you know they'll get back to at or slightly above highs and then the FED will cut Bank of Japan will hike and they'll roll back over so just keep an eye on the end is is what I'm trying to say to you in a Cliffs notes version uh JP Morgan tempers earnings optimism leading Bank stocks down so that was um uh Jamie Diamond again talking about Net Insurance income we as we said uh got out of all of our banks those had huge runs except for that we did keep our so we took profits on um city and Bank of America what we did keep is the Regional Bank K basket we think that's going to continue to outperform even though it's gone up a lot for us uh these others we'd like to buy back hopefully late October November if they fall a lot uh in anticipation of a 2025 late 2024 25 Investment Banking cycle but I don't think they're going to get cheap cheapap enough for us to buy back in but my guess is we'll see 10 20% pullbacks um but we we had monster runs in those so manufacturing is struggling to take off but it's above that lowest desile where it got earlier in the year uh manufacturing headwind set to ease with the onset of global monetary policy easing cycle that's a big deal and what you can see here percent of central banks in easing mode push forward by nine months every time that happens manufacturing turns around manufacturing pmis follow that easing cycle and this time will be no different and there are a lot of small and midcap in those uh buckets X recessions the first fed cut has marked the trough in US ISM Manufacturing PMI again we had two recessions in two years 2020 and 2022 first two quarters of 2022 negative GDP technical recession this will be a cut into a non- recession even if you look at GDP now we're nowhere near negative GDP you would need two consecutive quarters so therefore uh you're going to see ISM start to turn up uh just like you do in the non- recessionary period manufacturing moves in sync with financial conditions the outside Gap that has opened up is unsustainable so you see this Open Jaw fish mouth this will converge just as it does every time the last time it got this far apart you saw in 2002 and sure enough it caught up again the 2002 to 2007 period everything is syncing up um EPS growth projections continue to Trend up across all regions this is the mag 7 again earnings just a reminder and for new viewers magnificent 7 earnings growth collapsing from 53% down to 18% to to down to 16% while the unmagnify from negative earnings growth to all the way back to uh low double digit 12% in the fourth quarter and Beyond double digits all of next year that's why you're going to see a lot of those stocks Left Behind double and triple um sentiment is optimistic but not euphoric which is what leads me to believe we can have some strength into that first cut and then from there get cautious we'll see how that plays out uh Bank of America analysts have been making the most downgrades relative to upgrades within Staples Staples are overpriced by the way um and um up and they've been making the most upgrades versus downgrades in consumer discretionary where we think there's opportunity same as Industrials and materials uh so we got to pay attention to all that I think the Staples and uh certainly the utilities trade I think that's gotten long in the tooth in the short term discount retailers underperform luxury retailers when oil prices rise um so just count luxury year on year WTI so the implication of this is with oil prices coming down we should be nearing yeah that's interesting that's kind of like what you saw in 2009 and what you saw in 2002 similar situation and then all of a sudden it reverse so these you know the Dollar Generals of the world and the Dollar Trees I keep looking at them I'm going to want to get involved in some way I'm just not there yet we're still doing work um big surprise was o inflation we got that wage growth is growth is improving across all income groups with lower income households still outpacing other cohorts so again you know I think some of the issue because if you look at Walmart yeah Walmart's had the trade down that's worked well but their execution has been Superior I mean you walked into Dollar General it was just a complete you know uh trash can is basically what it comes down to so I think they'll fix their execution and um they'll come back either them or Dollar Tree we're looking at both us household income uh that continues to rise this is from brandan Ahern yesterday Boba according with their Hong Kong filing bought 5.6 million shares equivalent to 73,8 yards which accounted to 6.2% of their adrs volume worth noting uh 10c 2.68 million of their Hong Kong shares today my TR but I suspect many will look back in a year and say how did we not see the signs that's exactly right I mean that's the one thing I give the Chinese credit for you know the US managers when Jensen Wong is selling a half a billion dollars of stock just as he splits the stock to the retail investors who got smoke down 30% he announces a you know $50 billion buyback to absorb his sales and uh right when the stock is trading at 41 time sales is when he announces the buyback the Chinese companies only do the BuyBacks when the stock is cheap uh the Americans do the BuyBacks when the stock is expensive so they can lay off their own stock and it's uh uh you just see it over and over there are very few management that actually aggressively buy their stock back in the hole in the US and uh and it's it's a shame so again keeping an eye on this XLE to xpy ratio getting towards an extreme Chinese uh we covered that with the prices this is from Seth golden the current regime has been the worst from small caps relative to large caps since 2000 again going back to our our same analog but after that was a long Runway of small cap out performance so you can see that here biggest drop between Regional and large Banks occurred as you would expect during the SB Silicon Valley Bank in 2023 Regional banks have underperformed large caps ever since but that is the largest bullish Divergence I've seen in almost any chart as RSI fails to make lower lows with relative performance banking lower lows uh the bottom for regional Banks and large Banks may very well have formed as Regional Banks versus large Banks may very well has formed as rate cut and certainty developed in June Regional banks are like gearing up for Q4 out performance and keep in mind a lot of the regional banks are what they're small cap stocks so this is what he's talking about with the Divergence with the RSI going up uh making higher lows while the um small small Banks relative to large banks are going down this usually precedes this which is interesting that we kept our K and uh sold our C and BAC over the summer at huge profits um okay this this is another one from Seth via Tom Lee midcycle rate Cuts equals winner winner chicken dinner after rate cut S&P higher every single time 1 to 12 months later so what he's saying is if it's not a recession which we just laid out why it's not a recession what happens one month out after the first cut uh equals plus 5.1% for the S&P 3 months out Plus 99.7% on average and 6 months out 14% with the 13 and 6 month win ratio is 100% so unless you feel that GDP is going to go from 2% to negative for the next two quarters you want to bet on equities being up on a you know a one to two months after the first cut 3 months for Shore 6 months for for darn Shore and it could be more meaningful Than People expect uh average Del duration of a bull market not following a former recession is 33 months that would take the S&P to May of 2025 and the average bull market gain for light conditions has been 63.6% which would take the S&P to 5852 but notice something else if the bull market ended in July it would be the shortest bull market in history tied with that from 2020 to 2022 question do you think the stock market would suffer the shortest bull markets in history back toback occurrence table informs that would be the lowest of all possible outcomes the other thing I would keep in mind\n\nthe bottom for regional Banks and large Banks may very well have formed as Regional

had that recession in the first two quarters of 2022 which wasn&#39;t declared an official recession but it was a technical recession therefore this duration should be uh not an average of 33 months it should be an average of 61 months because it was preceded by a recession and therefore the averages go and the gains go dramatically higher because the duration of the bull market is dramatically longer next early stages of inventory building is typically sign of recovery and or expansion cycle not a sign of econ economic weakness or recession this is another way to talk about the dstock restock cycle that we&#39;ve been pounding the table on for 6 months um and you can see here he&#39;s referring to Merchant wholesale inventory this looks a lot like what 2000 to 2002 right before you took off 2009 to 2010 before you took off and 2000 to 2001 as you were taking off so um there you go and I think we got to the last chart wow that was a lot of data in a short amount of time\n\nhere is that um here it's saying that it didn't follow recession I would assert that we did follow recession because we had that recession in the first two quarters of 2022 which wasn't declared an

um and you can see here he's referring to Merchant wholesale inventory this looks a lot like what 2000 to 2002 right before you took off 2009 to 2010 before you took off and 2000 to 2001 as you were

when it rains gold pull out the bucket not the thimble that&#39;s from Warren Buffett and then PayPal this is from Alex Chris PayPal&#39;s largest marketing campaign ever starring Will Ferrell this campaign reintroduces customers to a whole new PayPal highlighting how easy and rewarding it is to shop with PayPal everywhere both online and in stores this is Will frell doing his best work and uh and making people laugh and making people remember PayPal and PayPal&#39;s Cash Back Rewards uh I will not play it for you now but you can check it out yourself sentiment came in a little bit bullishness down to 31% bearishness up to 31% uh National Association of active investment managers Equity exposure dropped down to 71.9% again no man&#39;s land not an extreme I think we&#39;ll get an extreme before that cut I&#39;d love to see them get into the 90s or 100% Alibaba Merchants hail adoption of 10 cents WeChat pay on tbal and t-all so basically WeChat has the uh like a billion users in China and now alibaba&#39;s allowing them to use that form of payment on tbal and t-all if they don&#39;t want to use alipe which I think is a good thing not a bad thing PB consider three uh reserve requirement ratio cut ahead of us fed Cuts uh so you know more talk towards easing Alibaba yields good results from three-year inspection says regulator they closed out the inspection that started the collapse 3 years ago so that&#39;s good Yellen says she would welcome a visit by her Chinese counterpart that&#39;s good China&#39;s Central Bank sees room to lower Banks reserve requirement ratio they are now saying this could come as soon as September which would be good which is now uh Alibaba looks beyond Chinese Supply suppliers as additional tarff threat looms so what did they do here uh they&#39;re talking about IDC growth of 32% 20 trillion business so they&#39;re growing super fast so they can build another Alibaba on top of the Alibaba they have with the international incoming years Alibaba join to join stock connect from Tuesday in potential 12 billion boost uh it&#39;s now looking like more everyone&#39;s updating their um estimates since the first few days of buying has been pretty aggressive Alibaba Logistics arm La launches next day delivery in Europe builds new hubs this wasn&#39;t even part of their business years ago now it&#39;s going to become a major part of their business Alibaba is battling with teu parent P pindu Duo Jack M says that&#39;s a good thing yeah it walked them up out of their slumber uh steadfast blah blah blah so Jack Ma&#39;s back in the picture that&#39;s good Z urges efforts to hit annual growth Target amid Rising doubt 5% growth Target so they&#39;re going to probably juice the economy a little bit before the end of the year China to cut rates on $5 trillion of mortgages as soon as September some banks are making final preparations for rate adjustments Move May spur household consumption so that&#39;s a good thing not a bad thing uh this is from Brendan Ahern who runs kweb by the way Mainland investors bu Hong Kong 3.5 billion of shares net of sales today that&#39;s about a half a billion dollars of us buying today alone so what did they anticipate in the first uh 12 to 18 months that it would do 20 to uh 20 to to4 40 billion dollars of new buyers over the first year and a half they&#39;ve probably done uh maybe about a billion and a half two billion in the first two three days uh so that&#39;s moving right on track Alibaba to benefit more from crossb link trading history of 10cent mitan shows 10cent gained 23% in the first 6 months after joining stock connect remember they just joined stock connect two three days ago while Maan and Zi more than doubled over 12 months after they joined the stock connect so keep that in mind ladies and gentlemen uh this could be more meaningful than anyone even expects Chinese chipm shows progress with new euv patent from domestic lithography Champion again put on the tariffs they figure it out themselves or the the uh sanctions inflation Rises 2.5% in August less than expected Intel is exploring the sale of part of the stake of mobile ey as well as its Network and Edge business so they&#39;re going to create some liquidity and that&#39;s the key with these turnaround businesses is the margin of saf has to be large enough that they have outs they have things that they can sell to create the runway for their turnaround plan to kick in uh just like it did with all the others that we&#39;ve done over the last few years that you&#39;ve been listening this one will be no different this definitely feels a little hairier but when you&#39;re trading a tangible book and you still got you know it&#39;s amazing how aggressively people talk like they&#39;re going out of business because they only did 52 billion of Revenue in the last 12 months I mean when you got $52 billion coming in the door you can cut a few jobs and you can sell a few non-core assets to live another day to turn the corner to catch the next cycle and to have a double or triple in your stock over the next 3 to 5 years um and you don&#39;t even have to predict the future to get those type of results but people are impatient and they can&#39;t handle the short-term volatility so they they sell their stock to people like me uh who step in and buy it and then you&#39;ll see the activists come in and and it will be Off to the Races as an FYI the board was meeting in the last couple of days so I&#39;m sure we&#39;ll see some announcements out of that in the coming week Mark Cuban warns taxing unrealized gains will kill the stock market insists Harris actually won&#39;t do it I mean that&#39;s kind of the craziest statement I&#39;ve ever heard if you&#39;re dating someone and they say I&#39;m going to kill you but you kind of think they won&#39;t actually do it do you keep dating them and ask them to marry you I would say the answer is a hard no uh the fact that they would have a thought like that that seems logical from their framework of thinking to me is a is a non starter that is not someone I would trust with running a$7 trillion business called uh US government allocations uh that thinks in that manner so I I you know I don&#39;t really you know uh want to spend any time talking about any social stuff that&#39;s not that important to me and it doesn&#39;t matter as it relates to the stock market so you can talk about all the reasons why one candidate is better than the other for for that reason but with policies like this whether or not they will be passed the fact that they&#39;re even being broached uh and not thinking about second and third order effects tells me uh of uh the level of analysis of the close advisors of the people that are putting out ideas like this is not at the level that is currently sufficient so either get new advisors and change your ideas or um you know hopefully it gets blocked but uh uh it&#39;s interesting that Cuban was saying that because he is a is a Big Time supporter of the people putting out those ideas uh PayPal expands role in Shopify payments what&#39;s in the card so they&#39;re just they&#39;re just hitting on all cylinders they&#39;re they&#39;re getting it done here&#39;s a quote from an analyst named Hutchinson if intel can ride out the storm it could reach a very profitable state in 2026 or 2027 if it succeeds with a new manufacturing process called 18a designed to create a the latest Cutting Edge chips the problem is you have to wait till then the problem with this analyst is he doesn&#39;t realize the stock market&#39;s a discounting me mechanism so if you get a little liquidity this the end of this year you get into 2025 when people are in 2025 they&#39;re not looking at 2025 numbers they&#39;re looking at 2026 and 2027 numbers so if there&#39;s a Runway the the stock starts to price that in very very quickly which means 40 50 bucks and if they actually execute on it it could mean 50 to 100 bucks uh so we&#39;ll just have to wait and see how that all plays out uh Intel Core Ultra V AKA lunar Lake goes official takes on arms uh

growing double digits in China Asia Pacific is up 25% a lot of that Asia Pacific up 25% are Chinese going to Japan to benefit from the currency uh weakness of the yen to buy Canada goose in Japan to bring back to China so a lot of this growth is because of China and everyone says China is dead simply not the case three in line with their long-term growth plan they are growing uh direct to Consumer and shrinking wholesale business to improveed margins and the customer experience number four the non jackets their windwear apparel and Footwear is up 20% year-on-year so they&#39;re now moving to become an allseason brand globally very similar to what Northface did for VF Corp and others uh five new sales training in key London store led to double digigit year- on-year growth comp within 45 days they&#39;re now rolling that across all 70 stores so keep an eye on that and then if you just look back step back dis passionately what&#39;s happening revenues per share have just been going up every single year and continue to go up cash flow per share continues to go up this was a softer year 2024 but not relative to the amount that the stock price declined went from $50 down to $10 um with flat for one year and now reaccelerating so that&#39;s when you find your opportunities and that&#39;s when you take advantage share counts going to come back down overall sales continue to go up and uh return on Capital remains in the low double digit range which is good    consumer inventory came down which is positive they work through some of that with um sales manland China was a highlight we covered that uh three-point plan they set their foundation for the next phase of our Brandon product Evolution they got hired this guy called Hadar aurman who is a big creative director so he&#39;s launching all this stuff like the hoodies and the hats and all the secondary stuff the the uh lightweight stuff second implementing best-in-class retail execution we talked about that with the training and simplify the way we operate to become more efficient and more effective they announced the layoffs last quarter uh strong gross margins continues this year&#39;s gross margins are going to be in line with last year which are strong 65% plus just seeing if there are any key points that I want to cover here are in season collection was a very positive development which can drive the gross profit dollar growth in the long term that will bring down margins it&#39;s kind of interesting it&#39;s kind of like PayPal they actually increased cash flow but the market sold them off because the margins declined uh because a brain tree the key is their cash flow per share is going to continue to improve as they sell more products even if it&#39;s slightly lower margin products in addition to their high margin um jackets their liquidity is fine they&#39;ve got 335 million of uh borrowing capacity they always draw down this time of year in anticipation of the strong season into the holidays   40 years that they have these massive draw Downs you know basically every 20 years uh like they had in 84 to 86 in 2002 to 2004 and to lesser extent in 2009 to 2011 and then we just had in 2022 to 2024 and they always recover and we&#39;re seeing this kind of inverse Head and Shoulders kick in here which implies a measured move to uh   13 56 in the short term and the recovery will continue every time goes back to New highs which would be 88 plus   they sold off the Kidney Care business they&#39;ll get three billion net after taxes and Banker fees which they&#39;ll use to pay down debt and if you remember our whole thesis to getting involved   was that   you know when no one wanted the damn stock was that they were going to separate the kidney care business which was the slow growing business which was dragging the multiple that had traded at 16 was down to 10 times and once they got rid of the kidney business you would start to see in the next 6 months a reating of the multiple so even without the business dramatically improving   just taking the multiple from you know 11 12 times to 16 to 18 times on   forward earnings you&#39;re looking at you know $ 45 $50 stock and then as the business recovers and grows   it&#39;s going to go a lot higher over time as it does every single cycle so you can see the margin expansion the operating margin the earnings growth of 24% increased   so it beat guidance on both the top and bottom line   grew sales 3% they   raised guidance on the top and bottom line they got the sale done which is what we talked about they improved operating efficiency they launched Nova MyQ they   had growth across all their sectors that was the key theme everything is hitting on all cylinders now and they&#39;ve got cash to delever back to investment grade   and they&#39;re Off to the Races and this is why they call me turnaround Tom because I love these stories I love buying them when there&#39;s hair and then when they double and triple everyone&#39;s like how did that happen and then they&#39;re all excited after they double and triple and they&#39;re all buying zero date options when we&#39;re selling out out our stock and everyone&#39;s excited so   pretty exciting to see all that   earnings revisions in the last 60 days for the top 30 weights went up 6% for this year and up 5.6% next year so that&#39;s good and materials also   materials are down 4.6 and down 4.18 so keeping an eye on that my guess is that by one or two stocks because this is not a weighted list this is just an absolute list just trying to see where that big hit was from looks like U Martin maretta is is the culprit   so that might just be a discret situation economic data we covered most of this largely the inflation   and the wholesale inflation came in better than expected jobs are a concern earnings estimates stay elevated 15% growth next year and now   on to the\n\n earnings you&#39;re looking at you know $ 45 $50 stock and then as the business recovers and grows uh it&#39;s going to go a lot higher over time as it does every single cycle so you can see the margin expansion the operating margin the earnings growth of 24% increased um so it beat guidance on both the top and bottom line um grew sales 3% they uh raised guidance on the top and bottom line they got the sale done which is what we talked about they

and everyone&#39;s excited so uh pretty exciting to see all that you can go through that fear and again this is not at a level where we want to be selling a lot it&#39;s at a level where we want to be long and um I think that&#39;s it earnings uh the growth stocks IBD 50 earnings revisions in the last 60 days for the top 30 weights went up 6% for this year and up 5.6% next year so that&#39;s good and materials also uh materials are down 4.6 and down 4.18 so keeping an eye on that my guess is that by one or two stocks because this is not a weighted list this is just an absolute list just trying

always say opinion not advice click go to hedge fund tips.com click on terms and here we go um find the quotes of the day particularly beneficial oh one you frequently mention is buffets I don&#39;t look to jump over s foot bars I look for one foot bars that I can step over how do you reconcile that quote with your turnaround Tom Investments uh Intel in particular strikes me like it might be a 7 foot bar so I would be interested in hearing your further thoughts greetings from Canada and thanks in advance so Chris um for me these are the one foot bars the seven foot bars are the ones where I have to predict the future and think that I know what the next new technology is going to be in the case of intel if they liquidate tomorrow I get my money out if they live another day I probably get double my money and if they actually execute I get Triple to quadruple of my money and it&#39;s just a question of waiting so as long as I&#39;m not on Leverage for me those are the one foot bars that turnarounds um as far as how I invest versus how some of my I you invest uh like David teer like uh Warren Buffett like Charlie Monger uh t\n\n\nI don&#39;t have to stay up all night wondering if Boeing is going to sell planes next year I mean I it&#39;s a no-brainer so if I own it at 150 or 160 and it goes to 130 before it goes to 350 I don&#39;t care I&#39;m not on Leverage um and um and if it goes to 130 and if we have Capital available we buy more so you know intel if it goes to 15 before it goes to 50 I don&#39;t it doesn&#39;t I love it if there&#39;s if there&#39;s cash available if there&#39;s new clients on board we&#39;re going to buy more I mean that&#39;s just how we think so these are the one foot bars the seven foot bars is what you all are doing wondering if um you know nvidia&#39;s growth rate is actually cutting in half now even if they grow 4 billion a quarter so the multiple is not supportive and you wind up with these big 30 and 40% Corrections uh and then everyone gets out all at once and you have another you know zoom on your hands and I&#39;m not saying that&#39;s necessarily the case with uh Nvidia it&#39;s a great company but it&#39;s pric is what you pay values what you get it&#39;s too hard for me to guess how many more suckers are going to come in and pay 80 times sales versus 40 times sales that&#39;s the 7 foot bar which I&#39;m not interested in climbing John Clark I know you&#39;ve been bearish on the dollar for a while I say bearish and right by the way uh what are your thoughts on the Euro over the longer term it&#39;s going up ### ASK_ME_ANYTHING_QA\nEuro&#39;s been in a range for almost two years you think you can get above 2 112 yes and a lot higher I mean um how far do I think it run it&#39;s going to run to 13710 I I I have no idea how far it can run I mean it&#39;s just a theme it&#39;s um it&#39;s the wrong it&#39;s the wrong question if you get the theme right you can play equities in such a way that you can make fortunes if you get the theme right of weakening dollar and the impact that has on International stocks and then you get a couple of the turnaround International stocks on top of it that are high quality where you don&#39;t have to guess the future you can make 6X even if the Euro only moves 12% uh versus trying to buy options on the Euro which maybe it only moves 15% and you could have made 300% buying three or four International stocks um that&#39;s the way to think about it so I don&#39;t really care about a particular level I don&#39;t think it goes goes all the way back to its alltime high but it wouldn&#39;t surprise me if it gets in the neighborhood Bob Johnson can you take a look at Badger meter ticker BMI okay let&#39;s have a look BMI uh you asking me for a short or a long I&#39;m assuming you asking me for a long and I&#39;m also assuming you&#39;re pretty new to this podcast so look everything&#39;s going great right now what do they do my guess is everything&#39;s going great and it&#39;s mostly all priced in so for me it&#39;s a pass but let&#39;s take a look cport initiates a buy at $235 where where were they at $30 all right let&#39;s see 52 * PE 10times [Music] book let&#39;s see here yeah I mean look this is a great business that will continue to go up over time but I think you&#39;re at an extreme right now it&#39;s got to rest for a while let me just take a look here so it&#39;s trading at seven times sales not bad but not great for a boring business like this um 52 times earnings let&#39;s the earnings growth you are trading at like a two and a half to three times the earnings growth yeah I I think it&#39;s priced for Perfection like if this thing pulled back 20 or 30% I&#39;d take another look but um it&#39;s a great business it&#39;s priced like that a great business I I need this thing to drop down to you know 160 to take a look and it may never do that but that&#39;s not for me I one thing I can guarantee you I&#39;m not getting a double on it over the next couple of years so I&#39;m not interested um all right Max Moore do you have any thought on VTO [Music] it&#39;s interesting I&#39;m getting a lot of um companies that have already had multibagger moves so this thing is up it&#39;s doubled in less than a year and cash flow is rolling over um so my thought is uh not for me water treatment blah blah blah yeah uh just take a look at some of the financials here revenues are pretty slow grower it&#39;s happen the earnings have been declining multiples five time sales 30 times earnings with very slow growth no no this is a promote I mean it seems like a quality business but uh let these guys get washed out and then look at it when it comes down by like 50% uh okay here&#39;s one from an anonymous person asking about Bath and Body Works bbwi another store that my kids like to shop at it&#39;s down I mean it&#39;s still up 5x from the covid lows I don&#39;t I generally don&#39;t like this type of business uh we&#39;ve seen it too much before they had that Bed Bath and Beyond which was a little different but then they had another one that was just like this called uh Bath and Body Works I think or not Bath and Body Works uh oh man I don&#39;t know it was one of those stores with the candles and the soap and all that stuff and it was just a fad um this looks like I don&#39;t know what this Revenue drop is they must have sold off the division their margins are declining their revenues have been flat I I don&#39;t know what&#39;s to really like here cash flow has been declining um let&#39;s see what else we got here yeah I know let&#39;s see here so revenues have flattened out and are declining earnings are declining and and the thing about it is the stock is only down 40% uh after being up 10x or call it 9x whatever um 10x at the peak 9x at the recent Peak um taken their debt down a little they they&#39;ve taken their debt down a bit but let&#39;s just see their balance sheet they&#39;ve got a billion of cash so their multiples are cheap because the business is declining I just I just don&#39;t think there&#39;s enough upside relative to the downside I mean like this is a trade that if you get it right it goes to $60 in a couple of years but like if these revenues continue to decelerate a stock like this could easily fall back to $15 so uh I don&#39;t really have any edge here so I&#39;m going to I&#39;m going to pass on that but um yeah generally don&#39;t like that type of business uh see too many fail Yankee Candle Company all that smelly candle it just it it comes and goes um Mex smelly soap you know right now Sephora like my kids spend so much money on Sephora it&#39;s crazy number one they shouldn&#39;t even be wearing makeup but you know I&#39;m outnumbered here I got three women to one they&#39;re going to do what they&#39;re going to do but um that&#39;s lvmh that&#39;s kind of interesting cuz that&#39;s been in the camp because of uh China weakness and that&#39;s another one we keep our eye on because China&#39;s going to come back and all these things are going to come back Hermes and so all again consumer discretionary all right uh this guy is asking Peter Webster&#39;s asking about Mexican TV group this is a cheap stock I think you won&#39;t get hurt with this um but it&#39;s television and it&#39;s uh it&#39;s not where money&#39;s going it&#39;s money it&#39;s where money&#39;s going away from cash flows recovering their revenues have been declining their margins have been declining I think this is a trade I don&#39;t think this is a business you want to own for a while I think it&#39;s you know I think you might get a punt back to seven or $10 if you&#39;re lucky but that&#39;s a speculation I&#39;m not I&#39;m not really interested that&#39;s a secularly declining business ### ASK_ME_ANYTHING_QA\nToma Fisher how do you allocate your time to students studying businesses at the micro level and follow following the market as a whole you often mention indicator sentiment seasonality character how this helps your strategy and how you divide your research time uh I don&#39;t have a framework for

thinking about all of it all the time and it creates I take in as much data as humanly POS possible I mean the amount of companies I study that I will never put a dollar into are staggering and they&#39;re on purpose because the things I hear in certain earnings calls and read in earnings calls transcripts cross over to businesses that I do hold or would hold or avoid or don&#39;t want and

that has Factor uh I think this is actually rear viw mirrror not just because covid is over\n\n### ASK_ME_ANYTHING_QA\nI want nothing to do with it at any price I can&#39;t predict the future but I I don&#39;t like the business whether it&#39;s Blue Apron they so many have gone bust and you could say well you know it&#39;s just this one and the other one that has factor that the other guy sent in last week and they&#39;ll be the winners I don&#39;t think any of them are going to be winners I think people are going to go out of their house they&#39;re going to you know if they don&#39;t want to cook they&#39;re going to buy that you know go to Whole Foods and get that stuff at the buffet and uh most people don&#39;t want to go out and if they&#39;re in family formation they&#39;re going to start going to Kroger&#39;s and Albertson&#39;s and Walmart and Whole Foods and um and Costco so for me it&#39;s a pass I understand why you got there and the framework is correct I just think secularly it&#39;s it&#39;s not a it&#39;s not something I want to own I think it could work as a trade because it&#39;s so cheap on every single metric and I can see what got you interested but it&#39;s not for me Jim Jones uh what&#39;s the difference between holding not New York and Hong Kong shares of Alibaba um there&#39;s no difference uh the the only reason we own some in Hong Kong is because there was a period of time about a year ago where they were going to there was a serious possibility that they could be Del delisted from the us so we didn&#39;t want to deal with that risk and since then the pcaob gave him the green light and uh so now it really makes no difference uh so I&#39;ll be good at that John Silva would you average up your VF Corp position after seeing the Stellar execution for Brack and darl and the team so far uh I never average up anything I I never buy up I buy down if it goes against me and I expect to buy down after I initiate a position but I I would I would never buy up um vfc you it&#39;s just starting here it&#39;s up from whatever it is 12 to 17 um I think the upside is a lot higher I mean Brack and Daryl created a whatever it was a 20 20 something bagger in a few years with Logitech and that&#39;s a commodity product I mean Vans and Timberland and northb and Dickies these are all kind of sexy brands that you can do a lot with I mean a a commodity video camera is nothing sexy and the guy turned the thing around and uh had a multi bagger so this thing this thing could I don&#39;t know if it&#39;ll go to new Highs but it wouldn&#39;t surprise me if it went to New highs over the next 5 years but we&#39;re certainly going to get a multibagger out of it and we&#39;ll look at the um we will look at the fundamentals when we get to our initial Target for intrinsic value based on what they&#39;re doing uh we&#39;re not going to new highs with Vans doing down 20% every quarter and uh and him getting on the phone and saying uh we&#39;re doing better we&#39;re down 20% instead of 21% like you know that dog don&#39;t hunt but that&#39;s part of the turnaround process and we&#39;re understanding of that and and based on the indicators he shared with us and some of the things that we&#39;re seeing uh we think that&#39;s going to be temporary and uh in which case uh there&#39;s a lot more upside and and the ride has just begun so uh no I&#39;m not giving you my predetermined exit for our first trunch that&#39;s to the benefit of my clients uh but um I will let you know when we&#39;re out and uh and in the meantime you shouldn&#39;t be in unless you&#39;ve done your own homework so we&#39;ll continue to update you on that we&#39;ll you know on our thinking around it they report earnings just as we did two three weeks ago but I think the upside is enormous and um and we&#39;re really betting on the horse here and that&#39;s something we love to do if you notice in our turnarounds is BET on the jockey even in the case of Advanced Auto Parts which has been a show um uh Shane o&#39; Kelly is doing everything he said he was going to do and uh we feel very good about what he&#39;s doing now could we have done without the soft guy guidance for the next two quarters of course but Disney had the same soft guidance it is what it is it&#39;s the lower-end consumer but he created the liquidity we needed to take solvency risk off the table uh and he was very successful with the world pack sale uh and now he&#39;s executing the way he did at HD Supply which was A7 billion business for Home Depot that he absolutely shot the lights out with and he&#39;s going to do the same thing with Advanced Auto Parts and turn it into a very nice very profitable business that&#39;s growing a 100 stores a year and doing it in the right way and servicing the professionals as well as the DIY Blended box Focus business no distractions and this thing will turn around and become a multibagger over time right now it&#39;s trading like death but that&#39;s what they do you know they go against you before they double and triple and it happens every single time um if it if it was easy everyone would do it simple Yes easy no and that&#39;s where our value ad is and um and and that&#39;s how it works so uh alios Grabber thanks for the great content been listening very year appreciate it beginning my

    "HEADLINES_AND_NEWS": "\n\npeople are intending that the Fed easing cycle terminal rate will be at 290 I'll believe it when I see it I think they might get down to 350 and be good enough there because just as they're coming down inflation's going to be more volatile than they expect and we've been saying this for a while they've got to let inflation run above 3% for 3 to 5 years to bring down debt to GDP that's the only way they're going to do it just like they did post World War two when debt to GDP also ran 120% debt to GDP\n### HEADLINES_AND_NEWS\nnext Chinese economy-wide prices in longest decline since 1999 so I guess a lot of people see this and they say don't invest in China I see this and I look at every single time you've had this level of price decline was a generational opportunity to earn outsized excess returns by buying Chinese equities so that's just how I'm wired and if you go back and you look at all these instances you're going to see the exact same thing um unless you believe day doesn't follow night and it will be night forever uh and um so far we just haven't found that in any instance of history but uh maybe this will be the first time but the the way I always think about these things is the world only ends once and um and if and if this is the time you have a lot more to worry about than your stock portfolio so I I'll leave it at that I mean there's no way that China collapses and the rest of the world you know I had a friend who passed away and he used to say uh when the US catches a cold Europe gets AIDS I he was trying you know he was trying to get a point across uh I think it's a simp situation uh yes us is strong to stand on its own but if China really caught an aggressive cold there's no way we don't at least get a flu uh in that environment so so the point is that these become opportunities day follows night etc etc uh 10year Break Even rate is at the lowest ever 2.0 so we know the cuts are happening TSA passenger volumes continue to increase above 20 19 levels you can see the data here well above it and continue to do that that's great for Boeing that's the only reason I bring that up uh China's CPI actually ticked up that's that's not looking that's looking less like deflation so the year onye next is China CPI year on-ear food is is coming up all these things are positive that means their rates will start to come up that means their currency will start to come up and uh all the things that we want to see there uh percent of unprofitable companies you know the big case that you see people making against small caps is that oh 41% of them are unprofitable well that has always been the case right before they have their biggest rallies why because they do their best after the first fed cut and what that means is these unprofitable companies the number one thing they need is cheap capital in the debt and Equity markets and that's a function of lowering rates and that's when these things absolutely take off so the fact so when people say well they can't do well because 41% are unprofitable look at the last four times that they did well uh you had instances where a higher percentage or an equal percentage in the case of the early 2000s uh were unprofitable and that that was at the beginning of the easing cycle and then they took off while the large quality uh took a a a long back seat uh okay mag 7 we already covered that this is from Matt sermino I think he works for Tom Lee below our historical uninversity average one-year forward Total return is plus 16.6% uh four out of six stocks ended higher a more balanced picture for those saying the yield curve uninversity recently had and coming out of that you had that uninversity [Music] yourarf out is the last couple examples was 2019 before covid and the great financial crisis so they say oh only bad things can happen but what they're missing is the demographics in the background that are more similar to the baby boom uh we had in the early 80s that led to 20 years of prosperity uh versus the Gen X um uh kind of um demographic pothole that we had in 2000 and 2008 My Generation only had 65 million people relative to the Boomers who had 80 and the Millennials now have uh a big generation so so that demand like you saw in the early 80s is going to be similar to right now so that uninversity very good things uh increase in volatility from July to November of presidential election years and then it peaks in November and comes right back down that's what we're seeing now uh yield curve suggests higher vix for years we covered that overweight consumer discretionary real wage growth is positive okay so consumer discretionary companies like Vans like uh you know Nike like Lulu like um all these things and even Amazon I'll say even though we took profits on Amazon because we had such a huge run from Fall of 2022 buying in the hole in March of 2023 we rang the register on that but I think a lot of discretionary are going to start doing well against all consensus as these Cuts kick in and lower people's interest rates and credit card bills and all that stuff uh and the consumer is so relatively delevered from the great financial crisis there's so much room for them to relever it's astounding um consumer discretionary has historically outperformed following the tightening Cycles okay and then um you see discretionary versus S&P 500 you have the tightening cycle that ends and then they start to outperform and that's where we are right now so we're going to continue to look for more opportunities in discretionary as well we we've already got a number of them we've got goose is a smaller position we've got uh VF cor we've got a number of others as well uh the destocking cycle which is which has been the theme why has this been so important well everything that we bought in the hole is working like crazy because the dstock to restock like your gener up uh basically double off the lows like your Stanley Black and&amp; Decker just coming out of the hole uh Etc so we're going to see more of that and uh believe it or not we're going to see a similar situation in Intel I know that one's a controversial one we're going to cover a number of things on that this week we did a major one on that about two three weeks ago after the earnings call so go back and look at that we're not going to do a whole another hour on that uh nothing has really changed other than that they're going to get a little liquidity they'll sell off Mobil ey they'll sell off uh this other uh big and unnecessary division that was bought right before Ginger came in they paid for both of them at 15 billion they'll probably sell them for 7 billion raise some cash not do the German Factor Factory all these other things will kick into gear the government will be forced to give them the money that they promised them and then all of a sudden you got a$ 30 and $40 stock and then we figure out is it really going to be worth 60 to 100 or do we take the profits again in the high 40s and call it a day uh we'll see where it is then but I would not bet against it so next uh Equity performance in different interest rate environments International equities and value uh percent value percent growth okay so when you have a value International tilt they do best in a 4 to 5% range um that's when they do best relative to us equities I think we're going you know to four pretty quick and whether we go a lot lower than that uh I think remains to be seen and and and if we do go lower than that it will be over a longer period of time so again the next 12 to 24 months favors that positioning next is now this is interesting the August 2024 rent growth is flowing year on-year according to Bank of America internal data yet the owner's equivalent rent spiked up this month so again that's a a constant push and pull We Believe owner equivalent uh rent contined to moderate after an unexpected Rebound in July it didn't uh which is why you're getting 25 basis points versus 50 next week uh Japanese Yen continues to roll over I think the right after the fed Cuts you're going to see the bank of Japan hike which is going to create a little more turbulence for the mag 7 again in October why because the carry trade is going to continue to unwind which was borrowing for effectively free and using that money to buy the mag 7 so as the bank of Japan hikes and uh um and people uh come out of that trade they're going they're the The Leverage is going to come out of the mag s so I think we're going to see continued volatility to mag s at least till late October uh that is I caveat that by I think the next week and a half into the cuts I think they could rip rip higher as a fake out um before this happens and then you know they'll get back to at or slightly above highs and then the FED will cut Bank of Japan will hike and they'll roll back over so just keep an eye on the end is is what I'm trying to say to you in a Cliffs notes version uh JP Morgan tempers earnings optimism leading Bank stocks down so that was um uh Jamie Diamond again talking about Net Insurance income we as we said uh got out of all of our banks those had huge runs except for that we did keep our so we took profits on um city and Bank of America what we did keep is the Regional Bank K basket we think that's going to continue to outperform even though it's gone up a lot for us uh these others we'd like to buy back hopefully late October November if they fall a lot uh in anticipation of a 2025 late 2024 25 Investment Banking cycle but I don't think they're going to get cheap cheapap enough for us to buy back in but my guess is we'll see 10 20% pullbacks um but we we had monster runs in those so manufacturing is struggling to take off but it's above that lowest desile where it got earlier in the year uh manufacturing headwind set to ease with the onset of global monetary policy easing cycle that's a big deal and what you can see here percent of central banks in easing mode push forward by nine months every time that happens manufacturing turns around manufacturing pmis follow that easing cycle and this time will be no different and there are a lot of small and midcap in those uh buckets X recessions the first fed cut has marked the trough in US ISM Manufacturing PMI again we had two recessions in two years 2020 and 2022 first two quarters of 2022 negative GDP technical recession this will be a cut into a non- recession even if you look at GDP now we're nowhere near negative GDP you would need two consecutive quarters so therefore uh you're going to see ISM start to turn up uh just like you do in the non- recessionary period manufacturing moves in sync with financial conditions the outside Gap that has opened up is unsustainable so you see this Open Jaw fish mouth this will converge just as it does every time the last time it got this far apart you saw in 2002 and sure enough it caught up again the 2002 to 2007 period everything is syncing up um EPS growth projections continue to Trend up across all regions this is the mag 7 again earnings just a reminder and for new viewers magnificent 7 earnings growth collapsing from 53% down to 18% to to down to 16% while the unmagnify from negative earnings growth to all the way back to uh low double digit 12% in the fourth quarter and Beyond double digits all of next year that's why you're going to see a lot of those stocks Left Behind double and triple um sentiment is optimistic but not euphoric which is what leads me to believe we can have some strength into that first cut and then from there get cautious we'll see how that plays out uh Bank of America analysts have been making the most downgrades relative to upgrades within Staples Staples are overpriced by the way um and um up and they've been making the most upgrades versus downgrades in consumer discretionary where we think there's opportunity same as Industrials and materials uh so we got to pay attention to all that I think the Staples and uh certainly the utilities trade I think that's gotten long in the tooth in the short term discount retailers underperform luxury retailers when oil prices rise um so just count luxury year on year WTI so the implication of this is with oil prices coming down we should be nearing yeah that's interesting that's kind of like what you saw in 2009 and what you saw in 2002 similar situation and then all of a sudden it reverse so these you know the Dollar Generals of the world and the Dollar Trees I keep looking at them I'm going to want to get involved in some way I'm just not there yet we're still doing work um big surprise was o inflation we got that wage growth is growth is improving across all income groups with lower income households still outpacing other cohorts so again you know I think some of the issue because if you look at Walmart yeah Walmart's had the trade down that's worked well but their execution has been Superior I mean you walked into Dollar General it was just a complete you know uh trash can is basically what it comes down to so I think they'll fix their execution and um they'll come back either them or Dollar Tree we're looking at both us household income uh that continues to rise this is from brandan Ahern yesterday Boba according with their Hong Kong filing bought 5.6 million shares equivalent to 73,8 yards which accounted to 6.2% of their adrs volume worth noting uh 10c 2.68 million of their Hong Kong shares today my TR but I suspect many will look back in a year and say how did we not see the signs that's exactly right I mean that's the one thing I give the Chinese credit for you know the US managers when Jensen Wong is selling a half a billion dollars of stock just as he splits the stock to the retail investors who got smoke down 30% he announces a you know $50 billion buyback to absorb his sales and uh right when the stock is trading at 41 time sales is when he announces the buyback the Chinese companies only do the BuyBacks when the stock is cheap uh the Americans do the BuyBacks when the stock is expensive so they can lay off their own stock and it's uh uh you just see it over and over there are very few management that actually aggressively buy their stock back in the hole in the US and uh and it's it's a shame so again keeping an eye on this XLE to xpy ratio getting towards an extreme Chinese uh we covered that with the prices this is from Seth golden the current regime has been the worst from small caps relative to large caps since 2000 again going back to our our same analog but after that was a long Runway of small cap out performance so you can see that here biggest drop between Regional and large Banks occurred as you would expect during the SB Silicon Valley Bank in 2023 Regional banks have underperformed large caps ever since but that is the largest bullish Divergence I've seen in almost any chart as RSI fails to make lower lows with relative performance banking lower lows uh the bottom for regional Banks and large Banks may very well have formed as Regional Banks versus large Banks may very well has formed as rate cut and certainty developed in June Regional banks are like gearing up for Q4 out performance and keep in mind a lot of the regional banks are what they're small cap stocks so this is what he's talking about with the Divergence with the RSI going up uh making higher lows while the um small small Banks relative to large banks are going down this usually precedes this which is interesting that we kept our K and uh sold our C and BAC over the summer at huge profits um okay this this is another one from Seth via Tom Lee midcycle rate Cuts equals winner winner chicken dinner after rate cut S&P higher every single time 1 to 12 months later so what he's saying is if it's not a recession which we just laid out why it's not a recession what happens one month out after the first cut uh equals plus 5.1% for the S&P 3 months out Plus 99.7% on average and 6 months out 14% with the 13 and 6 month win ratio is 100% so unless you feel that GDP is going to go from 2% to negative for the next two quarters you want to bet on equities being up on a you know a one to two months after the first cut 3 months for Shore 6 months for for darn Shore and it could be more meaningful Than People expect uh average Del duration of a bull market not following a former recession is 33 months that would take the S&P to May of 2025 and the average bull market gain for light conditions has been 63.6% which would take the S&P to 5852 but notice something else if the bull market ended in July it would be the shortest bull market in history tied with that from 2020 to 2022 question do you think the stock market would suffer the shortest bull markets in history back toback occurrence table informs that would be the lowest of all possible outcomes the other thing I would keep in mind\n\n### HEADLINES_AND_NEWS\nIntel Core Ultra V AKA lunar Lake goes official takes on arms uh for the ultimate AI laptop experience they control this base 40 million

    "ASK_ME_ANYTHING_QA": "\n\nstock market and sentiment results  we'll get through this and then get right to the\n\n### ASK_ME_ANYTHING_QA\n\n earnings you&#39;re looking at you know $ 45 $50 stock and then as the business recovers and grows uh it&#39;s going to go a lot higher over time as it does every single cycle so you can see the margin expansion the operating margin the earnings growth of 24% increased um so it beat guidance on both the top and bottom line um grew sales 3% they uh raised guidance on the top and bottom line they got the sale done which is what we talked about they improved operating efficiency they launched Nova MyQ they um had growth across all their sectors that was the key theme everything is hitting on all cylinders now and they&#39;ve got cash to delever back to investment grade uh and they&#39;re Off to the Races and this is why they call me turnaround Tom because I love these stories I love buying them when there&#39;s hair and then when they double and triple everyone&#39;s like how did that happen and then they&#39;re all excited after they double and triple and they&#39;re all buying zero date options when we&#39;re selling out out our stock and everyone&#39;s excited so uh pretty exciting to see all that you can go through that fear and again this is not at a level where we want to be selling a lot it&#39;s at a level where we want to be long and um I think that&#39;s it earnings uh the growth stocks IBD 50 earnings revisions in the last 60 days for the top 30 weights went up 6% for this year and up 5.6% next year so that&#39;s good and materials also uh materials are down 4.6 and down 4.18 so keeping an eye on that my guess is that by one or two stocks because this is not a weighted list this is just an absolute list just trying to see where that big hit was from looks like U Martin maretta is is the culprit uh so that might just be a discret situation economic data we covered most of this largely the inflation uh uh and the

Boeing is going to sell planes next year I mean I it&#39;s a no-brainer so if I own it at 150 or 160 and it goes to 130 before it goes to 350 I don&#39;t care I&#39;m not on Leverage um and um and if it goes to 130 and if we have Capital available we buy more so you know intel if it goes to 15 before it goes to 50 I don&#39;t it doesn&#39;t I love it if there&#39;s if there&#39;s cash available if there&#39;s new clients on board we&#39;re going to buy more I mean that&#39;s just how we think so these are the one foot bars the seven foot bars is what you all are doing wondering if um you know nvidia&#39;s growth rate is actually cutting in half now even if they grow 4 billion a quarter so the multiple is not supportive and you wind up with these big 30 and 40% Corrections uh and then everyone gets out all at once and you have another you know zoom on your hands and I&#39;m not saying that&#39;s necessarily the case with uh Nvidia it&#39;s a great company but it&#39;s pric is what you pay values what you get it&#39;s too hard for me to guess how many more suckers are going to come in and pay 80 times sales versus 40 times sales that&#39;s the 7 foot bar which I&#39;m not interested in climbing John Clark I know you&#39;ve been bearish on the dollar for a while I say bearish and right by the way uh what are your thoughts on the Euro over the longer term it&#39;s going up ### ASK_ME_ANYTHING_QA\nEuro&#39;s been in a range for almost two years you think you can get above 2 112 yes and a lot higher I mean um how far do I think it run it&#39;s going to run to 13710 I I I have no idea how far it can run I mean it&#39;s just a theme it&#39;s um it&#39;s the wrong it&#39;s the wrong question if you get the theme right you can play equities in such a way that you can make fortunes if you get the theme right of weakening dollar and the impact that has on International stocks and then you get a couple of the turnaround International stocks on top of it that are high quality where you don&#39;t have to guess the future you can make 6X even if the Euro only moves 12% uh versus trying to buy options on the Euro which maybe it only moves 15% and you could have made 300% buying three or four International stocks um that&#39;s the way to think about it so I don&#39;t really care about a particular level I don&#39;t think it goes goes all the way back to its alltime high but it wouldn&#39;t surprise me if it gets in the neighborhood Bob Johnson can you take a look at Badger meter ticker BMI okay let&#39;s have a look BMI uh you asking me for a short or a long I&#39;m assuming you asking me for a long and I&#39;m also assuming you&#39;re pretty new to this podcast so look everything&#39;s going great right now what do they do my guess is everything&#39;s going great and it&#39;s mostly all priced in so for me it&#39;s a pass but let&#39;s take a look cport initiates a buy at $235 where where were they at $30 all right let&#39;s see 52 * PE 10times [Music] book let&#39;s see here yeah I mean look this is a great business that will continue to go up over time but I think you&#39;re at an extreme right now it&#39;s got to rest for a while let me just take a look here so it&#39;s trading at seven times sales not bad but not great for a boring business like this um 52 times earnings let&#39;s the earnings growth you are trading at like a two and a half to three times the earnings growth yeah I I think it&#39;s priced for Perfection like if this thing pulled back 20 or 30% I&#39;d take another look but um it&#39;s a great business it&#39;s priced like that a great business I I need this thing to drop down to you know 160 to take a look and it may never do that but that&#39;s not for me I one thing I can guarantee you I&#39;m not getting a double on it over the next couple of years so I&#39;m not interested um all right Max Moore do you have any thought on VTO [Music] it&#39;s interesting I&#39;m getting a lot of um companies that have already had multibagger moves so this thing is up it&#39;s doubled in less than a year and cash flow is rolling over um so my thought is uh not for me water treatment blah blah blah yeah uh just take a look at some of the financials here revenues are pretty slow grower it&#39;s happen the earnings have been declining multiples five time sales 30 times earnings with very slow growth no no this is a promote I mean it seems like a quality business but uh let these guys get washed out and then look at it when it comes down by like 50% uh okay here&#39;s one from an anonymous person asking about Bath and Body Works bbwi another store that my kids like to shop at it&#39;s down I mean it&#39;s still up 5x from the covid lows I don&#39;t I generally don&#39;t like this type of business uh we&#39;ve seen it too much before they had that Bed Bath and Beyond which was a little different but then they had another one that was just like this called uh Bath and Body Works I think or not Bath and Body Works uh oh man I don&#39;t know it was one of those stores with the candles and the soap and all that stuff and it was just a fad um this looks like I don&#39;t know what this Revenue drop is they must have sold off the division their margins are declining their revenues have been flat I I don&#39;t know what&#39;s to really like here cash flow has been declining um let&#39;s see what else we got here yeah I know let&#39;s see here so revenues have flattened out and are declining earnings are declining and and the thing about it is the stock is only down 40% uh after being up 10x or call it 9x whatever um 10x at the peak 9x at the recent Peak um taken their debt down a little they they&#39;ve taken their debt down a bit but let&#39;s just see their balance sheet they&#39;ve got a billion of cash so their multiples are cheap because the business is declining I just I just don&#39;t think there&#39;s enough upside relative to the downside I mean like this is a trade that if you get it right it goes to $60 in a couple of years but like if these revenues continue to decelerate a stock like this could easily fall back to $15 so uh I don&#39;t really have any edge here so I&#39;m going to I&#39;m going to pass on that but um yeah generally don&#39;t like that type of business uh see too many fail Yankee Candle Company all that smelly candle it just it it comes and goes um Mex smelly soap you know right now Sephora like my kids spend so much money on Sephora it&#39;s crazy number one they shouldn&#39;t even be wearing makeup but you know I&#39;m outnumbered here I got three women to one they&#39;re going to do what they&#39;re going to do but um that&#39;s lvmh that&#39;s kind of interesting cuz that&#39;s been in the camp because of uh China weakness and that&#39;s another one we keep our eye on because China&#39;s going to come back and all these things are going to come back Hermes and so all again consumer discretionary all right uh this guy is asking Peter Webster&#39;s asking about Mexican TV group this is a cheap stock I think you won&#39;t get hurt with this um but it&#39;s television and it&#39;s uh it&#39;s not where money&#39;s going it&#39;s money it&#39;s where money&#39;s going away from cash flows recovering their revenues have been declining their margins have been declining I think this is a trade I don&#39;t think this is a business you want to own for a while I think it&#39;s you know I think you might get a punt back to seven or $10 if you&#39;re lucky but that&#39;s a speculation I&#39;m not I&#39;m not really interested that&#39;s a secularly declining business ### ASK_ME_ANYTHING_QA\nToma Fisher how do you allocate your time to students studying businesses at the micro level and follow following the market as a whole you often mention indicator sentiment seasonality character how this helps your strategy and how you divide your research time uh I don&#39;t have a framework for dividing my time because I don&#39;t think about it like an employee like oh I&#39;m going to do eight hours today you know some days I do 16 hours and some days I do six I mean but I&#39;m always thinking about all of it all the time and it creates I take in as much data as humanly POS possible I mean the amount of companies I study that I will never put a dollar into are staggering and they&#39;re on purpose because the things I hear in certain earnings calls and read in earnings calls transcripts cross over to businesses that I do hold or would hold or avoid or don&#39;t want and

that I don&#39;t do anything else so um there are all interrelated when I&#39;m golfing I&#39;m talking to business people and finding out about the economy when I&#39;m uh working I&#39;m uh just doing what I love it&#39;s a treasure hunt and when when I&#39;m with family I&#39;m just enjoying that so that&#39;s all I do uh and then\n\nI don&#39;t have to stay up all night wondering if Boeing is going to sell planes next year I mean I it&#39;s a no-brainer so if I own it at 150 or 160 and it goes to 130 before it goes to 350 I don&#39;t care I&#39;m not on Leverage um and um and if it goes to 130 and if we have Capital available we buy more so you know intel if it goes to 15 before it goes to 50 I don&#39;t it doesn&#39;t I love it if there&#39;s if there&#39;s cash available if there&#39;s new clients on board we&#39;re going to buy more I mean that&#39;s just how we think so these are the one foot bars the seven foot bars is what you all are doing wondering if um you know nvidia&#39;s growth rate is actually cutting in half now even if they grow 4 billion a quarter so the multiple is not supportive and you wind up with these big 30 and 40% Corrections uh and then everyone gets out all at once and you have another you know zoom on your hands and I&#39;m not saying that&#39;s necessarily the case with uh Nvidia it&#39;s a great company but it&#39;s pric is what you pay values what you get it&#39;s too hard for me to guess how many more suckers are going to come in and pay 80 times sales versus 40 times sales that&#39;s the 7 foot bar which I&#39;m not interested in climbing John Clark I know you&#39;ve been bearish on the dollar for a while I say bearish and right by the way uh what are your thoughts on the Euro over the longer term it&#39;s going up ### ASK_ME_ANYTHING_QA\nEuro&#39;s been in a range for almost two years you think you can get above 2 112 yes and a lot higher I mean um how far do I think it run it&#39;s going to run to 13710 I I I have no idea how far it can run I mean it&#39;s just a theme it&#39;s um it&#39;s the wrong it&#39;s the wrong question if you get the theme right you can play equities in such a way that you can make fortunes if you get the theme right of weakening dollar and the impact that has on International stocks and then you get a couple of the turnaround International stocks on top of it that are high quality where you don&#39;t have to guess the future you can make 6X even if the Euro only moves 12% uh versus trying to buy options on the Euro which maybe it only moves 15% and you could have made 300% buying three or four International stocks um that&#39;s the way to think about it so I don&#39;t really care about a particular level I don&#39;t think it goes goes all the way back to its alltime high but it wouldn&#39;t surprise me if it gets in the neighborhood Bob Johnson can you take a look at Badger meter ticker BMI okay let&#39;s have a look BMI uh you asking me for a short or a long I&#39;m assuming you asking me for a long and I&#39;m also assuming you&#39;re pretty new to this podcast so look everything&#39;s going great right now what do they do my guess is everything&#39;s going great and it&#39;s mostly all priced in so for me it&#39;s a pass but let&#39;s take a look cport initiates a buy at $235 where where were they at $30 all right let&#39;s see 52 * PE 10times [Music] book let&#39;s see here yeah I mean look this is a great business that will continue to go up over time but I think you&#39;re at an extreme right now it&#39;s got to rest for a while let me just take a look here so it&#39;s trading at seven times sales not bad but not great for a boring business like this um 52 times earnings let&#39;s the earnings growth you are trading at like a two and a half to three times the earnings growth yeah I I think it&#39;s priced for Perfection like if this thing pulled back 20 or 30% I&#39;d take another look but um it&#39;s a great business it&#39;s priced like that a great business I I need this thing to drop down to you know 160 to take a look and it may never do that but that&#39;s not for me I one thing I can guarantee you I&#39;m not getting a double on it over the next couple of years so I&#39;m not interested um all right Max Moore do you have any thought on VTO [Music] it&#39;s interesting I&#39;m getting a lot of um companies that have already had multibagger moves so this thing is up it&#39;s doubled in less than a year and cash flow is rolling over um so my thought is uh not for me water treatment blah blah blah yeah uh just take a look at some of the financials here revenues are pretty slow grower it&#39;s happen the earnings have been declining multiples five time sales 30 times earnings with very slow growth no no this is a promote I mean it seems like a quality business but uh let these guys get washed out and then look at it when it comes down by like 50% uh okay here&#39;s one from an anonymous person asking about Bath and Body Works bbwi another store that my kids like to shop at it&#39;s down I mean it&#39;s still up 5x from the covid lows I don&#39;t I generally don&#39;t like this type of business uh we&#39;ve seen it too much before they had that Bed Bath and Beyond which was a little different but then they had another one that was just like this called uh Bath and Body Works I think or not Bath and Body Works uh oh man I don&#39;t know it was one of those stores with the candles and the soap and all that stuff and it was just a fad um this looks like I don&#39;t know what this Revenue drop is they must have sold off the division their margins are declining their revenues have been flat I I don&#39;t know what&#39;s to really like here cash flow has been declining um let&#39;s see what else we got here yeah I know let&#39;s see here so revenues have flattened out and are declining earnings are declining and and the thing about it is the stock is only down 40% uh after being up 10x or call it 9x whatever um 10x at the peak 9x at the recent Peak um taken their debt down a little they they&#39;ve taken their debt down a bit but let&#39;s just see their balance sheet they&#39;ve got a billion of cash so their multiples are cheap because the business is declining I just I just don&#39;t think there&#39;s enough upside relative to the downside I mean like this is a trade that if you get it right it goes to $60 in a couple of years but like if these revenues continue to decelerate a stock like this could easily fall back to $15 so uh I don&#39;t really have any edge here so I&#39;m going to I&#39;m going to pass on that but um yeah generally don&#39;t like that type of business uh see too many fail Yankee Candle Company all that smelly candle it just it it comes and goes um Mex smelly soap you know right now Sephora like my kids spend so much money on Sephora it&#39;s crazy number one they shouldn&#39;t even be wearing makeup but you know I&#39;m outnumbered here I got three women to one they&#39;re going to do what they&#39;re going to do but um that&#39;s lvmh that&#39;s kind of interesting cuz that&#39;s been in the camp because of uh China weakness and that&#39;s another one we keep our eye on because China&#39;s going to come back and all these things are going to come back Hermes and so all again consumer discretionary all right uh this guy is asking Peter Webster&#39;s asking about Mexican TV group this is a cheap stock I think you won&#39;t get hurt with this um but it&#39;s television and it&#39;s uh it&#39;s not where money&#39;s going it&#39;s money it&#39;s where money&#39;s going away from cash flows recovering their revenues have been declining their margins have been declining I think this is a trade I don&#39;t think this is a business you want to own for a while I think it&#39;s you know I think you might get a punt back to seven or $10 if you&#39;re lucky but that&#39;s a speculation I&#39;m not

fresh uh someone asked me about [Music] um what was it grab Holdings I think which was um anyway hellofresh look this is cheap I think that business is not the business I&#39;m interested in someone asked me about um the one that has Factor uh I think this is actually rear viw mirrror not just because covid is over oh my goodness we got more\n\n### ASK_ME_ANYTHING_QA\nI want nothing to do with it at any price I can&#39;t predict the future but I I don&#39;t like the business whether it&#39;s Blue Apron they so many have gone bust and you could say well you know it&#39;s just this one and the other one that has factor that the other guy sent in last week and they&#39;ll be the winners I don&#39;t think any of them are going to be winners I think people are going to go out of their house they&#39;re going to you know if they don&#39;t want to cook they&#39;re going to buy that you know go to Whole Foods and get that stuff at the buffet and uh most people don&#39;t want to go out and if they&#39;re in family formation they&#39;re going to start going to Kroger&#39;s and Albertson&#39;s and Walmart and Whole Foods and um and Costco so for me it&#39;s a pass I understand why you got there and the framework is correct I just think secularly it&#39;s it&#39;s not a it&#39;s not something I want to own I think it could work as a trade because it&#39;s so cheap on every single metric and I can see what got you interested but it&#39;s not for me Jim Jones uh what&#39;s the difference between holding not New York and Hong Kong shares of Alibaba um there&#39;s no difference uh the the only reason we own some in Hong Kong is because there was a period of time about a year ago where they were going to there was a serious possibility that they could be Del delisted from the us so we didn&#39;t want to deal with that risk and since then the pcaob gave him the green light and uh so now it really makes no difference uh so I&#39;ll be good at that John Silva would you average up your VF Corp position after seeing the Stellar execution for Brack and darl and the team so far uh I never average up anything I I never buy up I buy down if it goes against me and I expect to buy down after I initiate a position but I I would I would never buy up um vfc you it&#39;s just starting here it&#39;s up from whatever it is 12 to 17 um I think the upside is a lot higher I mean Brack and Daryl created a whatever it was a 20 20 something bagger in a few years with Logitech and that&#39;s a commodity product I mean Vans and Timberland and northb and Dickies these are all kind of sexy brands that you can do a lot with I mean a a commodity video camera is nothing sexy and the guy turned the thing around and uh had a multi bagger so this thing this thing could I don&#39;t know if it&#39;ll go to new Highs but it wouldn&#39;t surprise me if it went to New highs over the next 5 years but we&#39;re certainly going to get a multibagger out of it and we&#39;ll look at the um we will look at the fundamentals when we get to our initial Target for intrinsic value based on what they&#39;re doing uh we&#39;re not going to new highs with Vans doing down 20% every quarter and uh and him getting on the phone and saying uh we&#39;re doing better we&#39;re down 20% instead of 21% like you know that dog don&#39;t hunt but that&#39;s part of the turnaround process and we&#39;re understanding of that and and based on the indicators he shared with us and some of the things that we&#39;re seeing uh we think that&#39;s going to be temporary and uh in which case uh there&#39;s a lot more upside and and the ride has just begun so uh no I&#39;m not giving you my predetermined exit for our first trunch that&#39;s to the benefit of my clients uh but um I will let you know when we&#39;re out and uh and in the meantime you shouldn&#39;t be in unless you&#39;ve done your own homework so we&#39;ll continue to update you on that we&#39;ll you know on our thinking around it they report earnings just as we did two three weeks ago but I think the upside is enormous and um and we&#39;re really betting on the horse here and that&#39;s something we love to do if you notice in our turnarounds is BET on the jockey even in the case of Advanced Auto Parts which has been a show um uh Shane o&#39; Kelly is doing everything he said he was going to do and uh we feel very good about what he&#39;s doing now could we have done without the soft guy guidance for the next two quarters of course but Disney had the same soft guidance it is what it is it&#39;s the lower-end consumer but he created the liquidity we needed to take solvency risk off the table uh and he was very successful with the world pack sale uh and now he&#39;s executing the way he did at HD Supply which was A7 billion business for Home Depot that he absolutely shot the lights out with and he&#39;s going to do the same thing with Advanced Auto Parts and turn it into a very nice very profitable business that&#39;s growing a 100 stores a year and doing it in the right way and servicing the professionals as well as the DIY Blended box Focus business no distractions and this thing will turn around and become a multibagger over time right now it&#39;s trading like death but that&#39;s what they do you know they go against you before they double and triple and it happens every single time um if it if it was easy everyone would do it simple Yes easy no and that&#39;s where our value ad is and um and and that&#39;s how it works so uh alios Grabber thanks for the great content been listening very

in 2022 to 2024 and they always recover and we&#39;re seeing this kind of inverse Head and Shoulders kick in here which implies a measured move to uh   13 56 in the short term and the recovery will

slow growing business which was dragging the multiple that had traded at 16 was down to 10 times and once they got rid of the kidney business you would start to see in the next 6 months a reating of

    "### MISCELLANEOUS": "\n\nCanada Goose and Baxter uh Canada Goose key points revenues continue to grow free cash flow uh recovering margins are high stock price subdued number two growing double digits in China Asia Pacific is up 25% a lot of that Asia Pacific up 25% are Chinese going to Japan to benefit from the currency uh weakness of the yen to buy Canada goose in Japan to bring back to China so a lot of this growth is because of China and everyone says China is dead simply not the case three in line with their long-term growth plan they are growing uh direct to Consumer and shrinking wholesale business to improveed margins and the customer experience number four the non jackets their windwear apparel and Footwear is up 20% year-on-year so they&#39;re now moving to become an allseason brand globally very similar to what Northface did for VF Corp and others uh five new sales training in key London store led to double digigit year- on-year growth comp within 45 days they&#39;re now rolling that across all 70 stores so keep an eye on that and then if you just look back step back dis passionately what&#39;s happening revenues per share have just been going up every single year and continue to go up cash flow per share continues to go up this was a softer year 2024 but not relative to the amount that the stock price declined went from $50 down to $10 um with flat for one year and now reaccelerating so that&#39;s when you find your opportunities and that&#39;s when you take advantage share counts going to come back down overall sales continue to go up and uh return on Capital remains in the low double digit range which is good    consumer inventory came down which is positive they work through some of that with um sales manland China was a highlight we covered that uh three-point plan they set their foundation for the next phase of our Brandon product Evolution they got hired this guy called Hadar aurman who is a big creative director so he&#39;s launching all this stuff like the hoodies and the hats and all the secondary stuff the the uh lightweight stuff second implementing best-in-class retail execution we talked about that with the training and simplify the way we operate to become more efficient and more effective they announced the layoffs last quarter uh strong gross margins continues this year&#39;s gross margins are going to be in line with last year which are strong 65% plus just seeing if there are any key points that I want to cover here are in season collection was a very positive development which can drive the gross profit dollar growth in the long term that will bring down margins it&#39;s kind of interesting it&#39;s kind of like PayPal they actually increased cash flow but the market sold them off because the margins declined uh because a brain tree the key is their cash flow per share is going to continue to improve as they sell more products even if it&#39;s slightly lower margin products in addition to their high margin um jackets their liquidity is fine they&#39;ve got 335 million of uh borrowing capacity they always draw down this time of year in anticipation of the strong season into the holidays   40 years that they have these massive draw Downs you know basically every 20 years uh like they had in 84 to 86 in 2002 to 2004 and to lesser extent in 2009 to 2011 and then we just had in 2022 to 2024 and they always recover and we&#39;re seeing this kind of inverse Head and Shoulders kick in here which implies a measured move to uh   13 56 in the short term and the recovery will continue every time goes back to New highs which would be 88 plus   they sold off the Kidney Care business they&#39;ll get three billion net after taxes and Banker fees which they&#39;ll use to pay down debt and if you remember our whole thesis to getting involved   was that   you know when no one wanted the damn stock was that they were going to separate the kidney care business which was the slow growing business which was dragging the multiple that had traded at 16 was down to 10 times and once they got rid of the kidney business you would start to see in the next 6 months a reating of the multiple so even without the business dramatically improving   just taking the multiple from you know 11 12 times to 16 to 18 times on   forward earnings you&#39;re looking at you know $ 45 $50 stock and then as the business recovers and grows   it&#39;s going to go a lot higher over time as it does every single cycle so you can see the margin expansion the operating margin the earnings growth of 24% increased   so it beat guidance on both the top and bottom line   grew sales 3% they   raised guidance on the top and bottom line they got the sale done which is what we talked about they improved operating efficiency they launched Nova MyQ they   had growth across all their sectors that was the key theme everything is hitting on all cylinders now and they&#39;ve got cash to delever back to investment grade   and they&#39;re Off to the Races and this is why they call me turnaround Tom because I love these stories I love buying them when there&#39;s hair and then when they
