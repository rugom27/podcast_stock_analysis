[0.68s] welcome to hedge fun tips with Tom Hayes
[3.32s] I&#39;m Tom Hayes and this is your 256
[6.279s] podcast video cast for the weekending
[8.36s] September 12th 2024 a lot of great stuff
[11.679s] to cover today so we&#39;ll get right down
[13.12s] to it family first then business uh got
[16.0s] to spend a extended weekend uh Friday
[19.32s] through or Thursday night through Monday
[22.0s] in Orange County with the girls and my
[25.119s] wife they&#39;re out there uh training for
[28.56s] water polo and
[30.56s] swimming uh pretty pretty exciting stuff
[33.04s] by the way they&#39;re training with uh well
[35.079s] we&#39;ll get into that a second uh so
[37.48s] that&#39;s a picture I believe in Huntington
[39.8s] Beach and that definitely is the
[41.96s] Huntington Beach Pier at night which was
[43.96s] a lot of fun and then of course I did
[46.6s] some Channel checks this was so wild the
[49.079s] culture of Vans now In fairness
[51.719s] Huntington Beach is Surf City where so
[53.96s] there&#39;s a lot of skateboarders so
[55.52s] everyone is wearing Vans which was you
[57.84s] know very nice as a a nice size owner of
[60.879s] VF Corp uh but it wasn&#39;t just that they
[64.28s] had Vans I I looked at this store they
[66.56s] had vans on roller skates and I thought
[69.24s] this was just kind of like a concept
[71.479s] until I went down to the beach and I saw
[73.479s] people roller skating with Vans roller
[77.0s] skates which is must just be a
[78.759s] Huntington Beach thing but I was pretty
[80.439s] blown away that&#39;s the girls at dinner
[82.479s] one night that&#39;s them doing their uh
[85.4s] homeschooling during the day in between
[88.0s] water polo and swimming that&#39;s me at the
[90.92s] Van store in um I think Fountain Valley
[96.2s] and I was talking to star who was an
[98.56s] amazing host at the store a worker at
[101.52s] the store about all the stuff and she
[104.439s] said that these new schools are selling
[108.719s] so fast
[110.68s] for back to school that they were
[112.92s] actually out of stock it sold so much
[115.759s] faster than they could have possibly
[117.079s] anticipated they had to wait uh to get
[119.36s] more in and they did in time for school
[121.439s] and they were able to meet the demand
[122.68s] but she says these black and white new
[124.68s] schools are through the roof and then
[127.0s] she went through a couple of the other
[128.52s] newer ones that we&#39;ve covered on past
[130.28s] calls and I said you know she&#39;s been
[131.959s] there for four years I said so is this
[133.72s] year slower than last year she said no
[136.239s] uh just the opposite this has been the
[137.84s] fastest uh busiest 6 months since I&#39;ve
[140.76s] been here uh it&#39;s really really picking
[143.16s] up so you know that&#39;s anecdotal but uh
[148.0s] confirmatory from what I saw in New York
[151.239s] this is Mimi with Maggie
[154.64s] stefins uh she is um three-time gold
[160.84s] medalist for water polo she has the
[164.76s] record for the most goals scored by an
[169.2s] individual woman in water polo that is
[171.879s] an olympic record so she&#39;s training with
[174.64s] her and she&#39;s training with Tony oovo
[177.8s] who&#39;s a five time Olympian was the
[180.319s] captain of the Olympic team silver
[182.319s] medalist and um fourth in goals of all
[186.92s] time for an individual in the men&#39;s
[188.519s] sport with 61 goals uh during his
[191.56s] Olympic career which is just
[193.2s] mindboggling uh was also led the
[195.879s] Stanford team to Greatness as well as I
[198.08s] I believe Maggie stepin played for
[199.44s] Stanford as well uh so that&#39;s what
[202.08s] they&#39;re doing out there working hard
[203.64s] that&#39;s uh Annabelle goofing around with
[205.879s] Caitlyn uh on The Babys set they&#39;ll
[208.2s] always be babies in my eye that that&#39;s
[210.56s] us at the beach Caitlyn and I so that
[212.68s] was a fun few days I will be on vanney
[215.64s] and Company on Tuesday morning so tune
[218.879s] in if you&#39;re free usually I&#39;m on the
[221.239s] 10:00 a.m. or 11:00 a.m. hour right at
[223.439s] the turn of the hour uh and then I will
[226.04s] be on Cavuto Coast to Coast on Wednesday
[229.439s] also in studio so tune in at 12:00 p.m.
[232.76s] for that got a lot of stuff to cover
[235.36s] today so let&#39;s get right up to it
[240.92s] uh this is job opening so all of this is
[243.68s] pointing to job openings we&#39;ve covered
[245.76s] all the data we like to be data driven
[249.04s] um is pointing to the the 25 basis point
[253.36s] cut the owner&#39;s equivalent rent which
[256.16s] will get into spiked up again so that&#39;s
[258.079s] going to limit the cut to 25 versus 50
[260.959s] which I think is a good thing I think if
[262.4s] the first cut comes out at 50 it would
[265.24s] spook the market a little bit they have
[267.0s] not set up the market for a 50 uh timos
[270.36s] has been talking 25 I think that&#39;s the
[272.759s] way to go and then maybe do 50 and or 25
[276.44s] 25 and then 50 right after the election
[278.479s] in December get in 100 I think the
[280.639s] Market&#39;s pricing in 125 bips uh before
[283.8s] the end of the year that&#39;s probably too
[285.16s] much I think it&#39;s going to be 75 or 100
[287.96s] and all this points towards it uh job
[291.08s] openings inflation
[293.759s] expectations uh this was
[296.96s] interesting German Factory orders un
[299.72s] expectantly increased for the second
[301.24s] month German&#39;s been slowing it seems
[304.639s] like it&#39;s starting to re accelerate and
[306.12s] then you had the ECB also cut rates
[309.28s] again this morning so again that that
[312.84s] narrative for international stocks
[314.52s] starting to take the torch I think we&#39;re
[317.039s] going to see that not only in emerging
[319.0s] markets in China uh but also Europe
[321.919s] start to see some level of
[323.24s] outperformance we&#39;ve seen that the green
[325.28s] shoots with the UK in recent months and
[329.28s] uh I think we&#39;re going to see that
[331.52s] elsewhere moving right along we have uh
[335.039s] S&amp;P 500 members outperforming the S&amp;P
[338.72s] 500 in the trailing 12 2 months that is
[342.199s] getting back to the levels uh that we
[344.639s] haven&#39;t seen since the early 2000s and
[347.759s] again going back to 2001 which we&#39;ve
[349.68s] covered many times in recent weeks and
[351.919s] months as an analog uh that&#39;s when you
[356.039s] had Emerging Markets small caps value uh
[359.639s] and
[360.6s] international and dividend pairs all
[363.36s] outperform 2002 to 2007 so another
[367.12s] confirmatory indicator pointing towards
[369.24s] that uh leading indicators already
[372.52s] trough this is a big deal this is not
[375.28s] the kind of thing you see turn up before
[378.08s] a recession it&#39;s what you see turn up
[380.039s] after a recession and we&#39;ve been one of
[381.96s] the few voices on the street that&#39;s been
[384.88s] telling you since early
[388.36s] 2022 when we had two quarters of
[391.72s] negative GDP growth consecutively that
[394.84s] the recession everyone was waiting for
[397.12s] already happened in the first half of
[399.08s] 2022 and that&#39;s why everyone who was
[401.4s] telling you about triple break putts and
[403.44s] how how the world was going to hell in a
[405.0s] hand basket and we were buying like
[407.759s] there was no like it was going out of
[409.24s] business in Fall of
[411.52s] 2022 when everyone was selling in the
[413.84s] whole uh this is why ladies and
[416.24s] gentlemen so these are the type of data
[418.68s] points that you see
[420.08s] that don&#39;t point to a recession if
[421.72s] anything they they point to the
[423.12s] beginning of an expansion and those
[425.039s] things that outperform which we&#39;ll
[426.639s] discuss
[429.16s] um each one percentage Point change in
[432.479s] the statutory domestic tax rate would
[434.8s] shift earnings per share by slightly
[437.56s] less than
[438.639s] 1%
[440.96s] so this is what so you know in theory if
[448.919s] Kam got in and increased the capital
[451.44s] gains tax to
[453.879s] 28% in theory you&#39;re looking at you know
[457.28s] 700 bit basis points
[460.72s] decline uh of earnings so you&#39;d have
[463.319s] basically your earnings growth would be
[464.879s] cut in a half for next year that&#39;s
[467.56s] assuming she could get it through which
[469.68s] again what does the market left like and
[472.319s] need it likes and needs gridlocks so
[476.0s] regardless of who wins the presidency uh
[479.159s] who ever as long as one party does not
[482.159s] get the power in the House and Senate as
[484.56s] well as the presidency these type of
[486.96s] dramatic changes are unlikely to be
[490.4s] implemented uh next let&#39;s see
[496.199s] here uh expensive relative to the last
[499.039s] 10 years those two groups that are the
[501.68s] least expensive are uh S&amp;P 400 which is
[505.199s] midcaps and S&amp;P 600 which is small cap
[509.96s] so again another theme we&#39;ve been
[511.36s] covering this is the US regime&#39;s
[515.08s] heuristic um value small size and
[518.919s] high-risk tend to farewell in a recovery
[521.919s] that is our base case this is what
[523.44s] looked like in 20012
[525.36s] 2002
[527.68s] um and what you
[531.399s] saw in recency bias was the high quality
[535.16s] lowrisk large size IE mag 7 outperformed
[538.64s] phase 4 right before phase one where
[542.2s] value small small size and high risk
[544.48s] really start to outperform so I think
[545.76s] that&#39;s where we are right now you&#39;ve
[547.399s] seen the mag 7 come off the boil a
[549.32s] little bit you started to see these perk
[551.24s] up I think after the FED Cuts that&#39;s got
[553.88s] going to persist and expand over the
[556.12s] next 12 to 18 months and we&#39;re
[557.839s] positioned for
[562.68s] that um this also talks about relative
[567.48s] sector and Industry value valuations
[570.56s] with energy showing the greatest upside
[573.04s] on the basis of Price to Book uh as a
[578.36s] matter of fact three price to operating
[580.2s] cash flow and forward PE those showing
[583.839s] the lowest upside or negative upside
[586.64s] Information Technology all this data is
[590.04s] from Bank of America Based on data from
[593.6s] 1986 to
[595.92s] 2024 on a dividend yield basis real
[598.68s] estate looks like it has the most upside
[601.279s] on a buyback basis financials look like
[604.48s] they have the most upside on a trailing
[607.079s] PE basis energy looks like it has the
[609.399s] most upside uh least upside on a
[613.12s] dividend yield basis is communication
[614.92s] Services least upside on a buyback basis
[618.399s] is information
[620.36s] technology and least upside on a
[623.36s] trailing PE basis is information
[626.12s] technology Enterprise Value to sales
[628.079s] most upside is financials least upside
[630.959s] is information technology um uh
[634.24s] Enterprise Value to eida most upside
[636.72s] energy least upside information
[638.76s] technology and Enterprise Value to free
[641.519s] cash flow most upside energy least
[645.16s] upside information technology so across
[648.56s] nine metrics what you&#39;re seeing
[651.36s] is in Information Technology having
[655.399s] negative upside relative to 40 Years of
[658.839s] History
[660.519s] um and again you know we kind of have
[663.04s] been pounding the table on this and it&#39;s
[665.48s] actually played out and we&#39;ll continue
[667.639s] to play out but what we&#39;ve also caveat
[671.44s] this with was this does not have to be
[674.16s] 2000 to
[675.44s] 2001 where Tech would crash it could
[678.399s] simply mean they stop their relative
[681.36s] outperformance and may have
[682.68s] underperformance so what does that mean
[684.639s] in English it could mean the indices are
[687.399s] up 10% mag 7&#39;s Up 3 to 5% and some of
[692.88s] the Left for Dead small caps are up 50
[694.8s] and 100% uh on an individual basis and
[698.6s] uh and emerging markets and so on and so
[700.76s] forth so there&#39;s a lot to be said there
[703.8s] um the yield curve is suggesting higher
[707.24s] Vicks for years to
[709.16s] come um that is also an
[714.68s] environment that we saw again in 2002 to
[718.72s] 20 7 when uh Emerging Markets
[722.68s] International small caps dividend pairs
[725.76s] Etc outperformed
[728.2s] Tech uh large cap growth quality
[731.48s] dramatically underperformed and that
[733.44s] happens after periods when they
[734.88s] outperform and you can see it again one
[737.16s] more indicator Chinese real estate B
[740.48s] stocks back to 2008
[743.279s] lows uh that for me and the last time
[746.399s] you saw before that was actually 2001
[750.44s] so I don&#39;t know how you look at
[753.0s] something like this and say that this
[757.6s] time is different like nothing almost
[760.48s] nothing could be worse than the great
[762.56s] financial crisis which was basically the
[764.56s] modern day equivalent of the Great
[765.92s] Depression with policy tools that
[768.44s] ameliorated the effect uh from a you
[771.6s] know 10year effect to a 2-year effect
[775.12s] but leaving that aside is
[779.32s] those people who took advantage of those
[781.32s] rare once in 100y year opportunities you
[783.92s] know made made fortunes you know whether
[786.04s] it was uh the Ken Joe Kennedy whether it
[789.04s] was the Rockefellers whether it was the
[791.56s] Vanderbilts you name it uh people who
[793.839s] step in when there are these
[795.48s] generational opportunities am I saying
[797.279s] to go buy skyscrapers in China no your
[799.48s] property right rights might not be
[801.76s] protected but what I am saying is if you
[805.24s] bought highquality durable businesses in
[808.199s] China or or the hangang index for
[810.8s] instance which is you know wait which is
[813.079s] basically Alibaba and 10 cent uh as an
[816.36s] ETF um you did extremely well coming out
[820.12s] of these periods that everyone said
[823.519s] nothing would change as a matter of
[825.72s] fact
[829.279s] um a writer from
[832.839s] Bloomberg asked me for my comments on it
[836.16s] and like you know he was basically
[837.92s] saying like we&#39;ve never seen anything
[839.56s] like this and I said to him yeah except
[843.0s] for I don&#39;t know every 4 years for the
[845.92s] last 25 years and I sent him this chart
[849.48s] that we&#39;ve used in the vid videoast
[852.04s] podcast uh a couple of weeks
[854.6s] ago and you know the fact of the matter
[858.0s] is it&#39;s China so every four years you
[861.68s] see these once in a lifetime once in a
[864.839s] generation catastrophic crashes that
[867.8s] always resolve to the to side and this
[870.88s] time will be no different uh whether it
[873.12s] was
[874.44s] 1995 and you know you crashed from uh
[878.12s] 14,000 to 6,000 50% crash and then you
[881.36s] went up 200% from you know 95 to 98 and
[887.079s] then guess what you crashed again a 70%
[890.279s] crash this is the Hang sang which is
[892.199s] basically chin Tech and then from 98
[895.839s] back to 2000 you again tripled up 20
[899.199s] 200% and then guess what you crashed 75%
[903.72s] in 2000 to 2003 and then guess what
[908.079s] after putting in a 2-year base you had
[910.16s] the biggest rally ever 4X 300% over the
[913.12s] next 5 years from 2003 to
[916.399s] 2007 then guess what you crashed another
[919.519s] 70% crash in 2008 then guess what you
[923.32s] doubled in a half this literally happens
[925.92s] every four years you can set your clock
[927.519s] by it and people are thinking this time
[929.519s] is different look it takes with the
[932.68s] exception of 2009 okay 2008 and 2009 it
[937.04s] only took a year to put in the bottom
[939.079s] okay every other time it took at least
[941.68s] two a year and a half two years uh and
[944.24s] the big ones like 2001 to 2004 2003 it
[949.12s] took two and a half years so we&#39;re on
[951.279s] let&#39;s see 2020 end of
[954.0s] 2022 and here we are at the end of 2024
[957.199s] so less than two years and then sure
[959.72s] enough you get the recovery and things
[961.399s] are Off to the Races so uh this time is
[964.04s] different no it
[966.36s] literally 24 years so you&#39;re looking at
[969.6s] since
[971.279s] 1994 uh 30 years you&#39;ve had this happen
[975.279s] 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 8 * 4 is 32 every four
[983.519s] years the the Hang say Chinese equities
[986.759s] collapse more than 50% and within the
[989.48s] next few years they go on to make new
[992.199s] highs and um so you can bet that this
[995.519s] time will be different you can say no
[997.68s] way I want to become a Rockefeller or
[999.519s] Joe Kennedy or Vanderbilt or anyone who
[1002.199s] took advantage and created these
[1003.92s] generational fortunes when other people
[1006.24s] were running for the hills because
[1007.92s] you&#39;re impatient or you&#39;re on Leverage
[1010.88s] um but uh I I just love seeing charts
[1013.92s] like this this this is what this is why
[1016.04s] I skip to work every day I literally
[1018.199s] feel like I&#39;m going to a treasure hunt
[1019.759s] and I&#39;m looking for these rare
[1021.48s] opportunities where you can buy stuff
[1024.439s] quality assets that are totally marked
[1026.52s] down right at or near the inflection and
[1029.039s] at or near the inflection could be a
[1030.24s] year it could be two years who cares uh
[1032.799s] when you&#39;re talking about double triple
[1034.36s] quadruples the key is at the end of the
[1036.72s] duration what was your irr and um
[1040.28s] usually the longer it takes to build the
[1041.76s] base like in by the way this is probably
[1044.6s] the most important message of this
[1046.12s] week&#39;s
[1047.319s] call is
[1050.4s] uh where did I put that there it is the
[1053.28s] the longest base that we saw was after
[1057.919s] the 2000 Crash from
[1061.28s] 18,300 down to
[1064.4s] 8300 um so about 60% crash it took from
[1068.76s] mid
[1070.52s] 2001 to Mid
[1074.559s] 2003 so late 2003 so just over two years
[1079.12s] to put in that base and then you had but
[1082.24s] because it was the longest base you also
[1084.52s] had the highest
[1086.559s] recovery uh of 8,000 to 32,000 so for
[1090.64s] forx 300% gain because the base took
[1094.159s] longer to build and here you had the
[1097.36s] bottom at late
[1099.039s] 2022 and then the second bottom in early
[1104.4s] 2024 we have not retested that yet so
[1107.28s] the bottom we believe is in this is one
[1109.36s] of these fake out after the first move
[1111.0s] up you get this check back like we had
[1113.36s] and now move higher uh so we&#39;re in the
[1116.12s] middle of that recovery and I think
[1118.4s] that&#39;s going to continue so and I think
[1121.48s] because the base took so long to build I
[1124.28s] think we&#39;re on the cusp of one of the
[1125.6s] biggest moves in the in a reasonably
[1127.72s] short period of time and I do think also
[1130.36s] it will probably be the last parabolic
[1132.08s] move in China based on age and
[1135.76s] demographics uh largest weekly outflow
[1138.32s] from energy funds since June
[1141.159s] 2023 I think that&#39;s uh signaling to us
[1144.32s] it&#39;s time to be looking more
[1146.28s] aggressively at energy we are
[1148.2s] comfortable with our position with com
[1149.72s] stock
[1152.08s] resources a number of you have been
[1153.84s] sending me some integrad but they&#39;ve
[1156.4s] already moved so much and they actually
[1157.76s] haven&#39;t dropped in concert with the
[1159.36s] underlying so I don&#39;t see big upside but
[1163.12s] I am looking at some of the servicers I
[1165.88s] am looking at some of the refiners and
[1168.159s] some of the more beaten down uh uh
[1171.84s] companies that have actually Fallen with
[1175.159s] the price of energy uh that could be
[1177.679s] potential opportunities in addition to
[1179.96s] Comstock but I don&#39;t you know with a
[1182.76s] concentrated portfolio I don&#39;t really
[1185.0s] need or want two major energy positions
[1189.039s] but I&#39;ll be open-minded if it&#39;s a fat
[1192.039s] pitch down the middle bull bear
[1194.2s] indicator is not yet extreme at extreme
[1196.799s] bullishness so that&#39;s why I continue to
[1199.24s] think it&#39;s it feels like it&#39;s been
[1200.559s] delayed but now it&#39;s picking up a little
[1202.72s] bit of life is the uh our expectation
[1207.6s] based on all the seasonality we&#39;ve
[1210.52s] discussed in recent weeks whether it&#39;s
[1211.96s] election seasonality first cut
[1214.039s] seasonality Etc was that we&#39;d get some
[1216.0s] strength and maybe knock on the door to
[1218.2s] new highs prior to the first cut suck
[1221.08s] everyone in into the market and then uh
[1224.2s] put on some tactical shorts in in
[1226.44s] anticipation of the pre-election jitters
[1229.039s] uh from the last week of September
[1230.88s] through the last week of
[1232.48s] October that may be actually playing out
[1235.48s] we had a major reversal
[1237.84s] yesterday uh bullish engulfing for all
[1240.76s] of you candle followers uh if that means
[1244.72s] anything
[1246.64s] that uh could yield that for the next
[1250.559s] you know six to eight trading sessions
[1252.919s] into that cut and maybe a little bit
[1255.32s] beyond uh if we get at our close new to
[1258.28s] new High
[1259.24s] but as far as hedging out the book I
[1262.24s] mean um everything that had froth that
[1265.36s] we made a lot of money in we harvested
[1267.72s] and we talked about that in late June
[1269.559s] and early July with mag 7 before those
[1271.799s] rolled over and the banks and uh and
[1274.919s] everything else so we&#39;ll look
[1276.36s] potentially to buy those back lower in
[1279.08s] October if the opportunity presents
[1280.76s] itself this is an interesting I don&#39;t
[1283.84s] know why this jobs report chart keeps
[1287.279s] repeating every single page there must
[1289.12s] be
[1289.919s] some glitch but uh this chart from Bank
[1293.799s] of America shows the Divergence be
[1295.919s] between luxury spending and uh lower
[1299.44s] income spending so this started to diver
[1301.84s] diverge in
[1303.799s] 2023 and it shows how Dollar General has
[1306.96s] collapsed and Ferrari has gone to the
[1310.0s] Moon uh I think and we&#39;re going to talk
[1313.48s] about some of these consumer
[1315.36s] discretionary stocks are getting
[1317.0s] exceptionally cheap and near inflections
[1320.6s] and and that&#39;s interesting because all
[1322.76s] the stocks that have been on my
[1325.0s] radar um or that we have been able to
[1328.52s] take advantage of are oddly consumer
[1331.64s] discretionary because they&#39;ve gotten
[1333.84s] extremely cheap so whether it&#39;s not a
[1336.48s] position and it&#39;s on our radar like Lulu
[1339.279s] uh which I spent some time at the store
[1340.96s] and watch my girls spend I got to I got
[1343.12s] to be honest with you I walked through
[1344.76s] Lululemon there was nothing I wanted to
[1346.919s] buy but you know whatever um you know
[1349.799s] I&#39;m probably not their target market but
[1352.76s] it really kind of felt to me it felt
[1356.0s] like the Gap I mean the stuff seemed
[1358.2s] Bland and boring and
[1360.48s] dull um now women will tell you but you
[1365.12s] know and I&#39;m just talking generally I&#39;m
[1367.64s] not talking about young people but I&#39;m
[1369.559s] just talking generally like Housewives
[1371.32s] will say well you know it makes my
[1374.44s] whatever it makes me look good yada yty
[1378.679s] I don&#39;t know they&#39;ve acknowledged that
[1380.08s] they they&#39;ve got boring stuff I think
[1381.52s] that&#39;s going to be an interesting
[1382.48s] turnaround situation but I don&#39;t know if
[1384.6s] the margin sa of safety is good enough
[1386.4s] you know another one that&#39;s on my radar
[1388.84s] again consumer discretionary that&#39;s just
[1390.44s] gotten extremely cheap is Etsy uh again
[1393.919s] I haven&#39;t done anything with that Nike
[1396.279s] by the way I mean you know I bought Vans
[1398.84s] because we own BF Corp so we already
[1400.279s] have consumer discretionary but I got to
[1402.32s] play stanwich next week which is like
[1405.84s] for those of you who don&#39;t play golf is
[1407.4s] an it&#39;s the best Club in Stanford and in
[1410.919s] uh in Connecticut and arguably like the
[1412.96s] east coast and stanwich greens are so
[1416.12s] special and fast that I got a note like
[1419.72s] you can&#39;t bring your normal spikes even
[1422.2s] though they&#39;re not real spikes anymore
[1424.2s] you got to buy spikeless golf shoes so I
[1427.2s] I went on and got these Air Jordans
[1429.44s] which are sick by the way and what&#39;s
[1431.72s] great about these is when I go out to
[1434.24s] visit in the kids in California I can
[1436.88s] wear these on the plane and then go play
[1439.44s] golf with them um so Nike is putting out
[1443.72s] some really great products I think Nike
[1445.6s] is I think Nike&#39;s more
[1447.96s] interesting and the reason I didn&#39;t jump
[1450.039s] on it one I already have Vans and two I
[1452.039s] already have China exposure which is
[1453.559s] basically what what Nike is but at some
[1456.4s] point it becomes so compelling we&#39;ll
[1458.039s] have to
[1458.919s] act it&#39;s just not today uh next August
[1462.799s] is surprisingly strong but beware of
[1464.64s] September and October so this
[1466.52s] shows monthly performance in election
[1468.919s] years from 20 uh 1950 to 2023 September
[1473.159s] down 4/10 of a% October down 7/10 of
[1477.559s] a% um and then you got a huge Rebound in
[1480.919s] November plus 2% and December plus
[1485.6s] 1.3% moving
[1487.72s] on International price to earnings
[1490.44s] discount versus the United
[1492.919s] States international stocks all world
[1496.88s] country index
[1499.24s] us
[1501.6s] is they&#39;re um trading at two standard
[1509.559s] deviations lower than the average of its
[1513.679s] relationship to the S&amp;P
[1517.32s] 500 PE ratio so two standard deviations
[1521.08s] that that is an
[1522.44s] extreme and what we know uh is that it
[1527.799s] runs in in both directions and the the
[1530.48s] last time it got two standard deviations
[1533.159s] above was 2010 and what happened for the
[1536.08s] next 10 years it dramatically
[1538.88s] underperformed the US so when
[1542.08s] International PE was two standard
[1544.039s] deviations above its long-term average
[1546.12s] the next 10 years it dramatically
[1547.799s] underperformed the US and now it&#39;s two
[1549.679s] standard deviations below its historic
[1553.2s] average I I I&#39;m willing to bet that the
[1557.399s] next 10 years International certainly
[1559.679s] the next five I don&#39;t really care about
[1561.12s] the next 10 International dramatically
[1564.36s] outperforms the us and you&#39;re like no
[1566.6s] way us exceptionalism blah blah blah
[1568.76s] look I&#39;m all for us exceptionalism I
[1570.6s] I&#39;ll wave the biggest flag on top of my
[1572.32s] house that you&#39;ve ever seen but um when
[1575.52s] it comes to making money I leave the
[1578.08s] idealism aside and I Look to what the
[1581.72s] data tells me and that&#39;s what the data
[1583.48s] tells me so um just remember you know
[1587.039s] turn around Tom&#39;s L than of the day when
[1589.76s] you buy a stock or a company or or a
[1592.679s] concept two standard deviations away
[1595.08s] from its mean if it&#39;s down 80% 90% you
[1598.76s] know if you buy it down 80% it can go
[1601.48s] down 90% which means a temporary 50%
[1605.96s] Mark tomarket loss before it becomes a
[1609.32s] four bagger and that&#39;s the difference
[1612.36s] you know one of our quotes of the
[1614.399s] week is from Peter Lynch the most
[1616.72s] important organ in the body as as far as
[1618.52s] the stock market is concerned is the
[1619.96s] guts not the head anyone can acquire the
[1622.2s] knowhow for analyzing stocks Peter Lynch
[1624.12s] you know I have clients that call me and
[1625.44s] ask me like why do you share all of your
[1627.279s] ideas with the general public uh and and
[1630.96s] your Concepts number one is I you
[1634.84s] know uh I don&#39;t share all of my ideas
[1637.919s] number one number two is even if I
[1642.6s] did
[1644.12s] um literally I could tell people I could
[1647.24s] have them watch me 24/7 and when they go
[1649.96s] off to do it their own they&#39;re not going
[1652.72s] to it&#39;s not internal to them that
[1657.76s] they&#39;re going to have the temperament
[1659.559s] and the patience because they&#39;re not
[1661.08s] really going to know what they own and
[1662.519s] they&#39;re not going to really have all the
[1665.08s] inputs that lead to the steadfastness
[1667.919s] and the patience and the and the
[1669.84s] equinity that comes when you have
[1671.519s] short-term price volatility and even
[1674.6s] though you have relatively short-term
[1679.519s] business stability uh in in most cases
[1682.919s] while you have that price volatility
[1684.399s] before you get the big recovery the big
[1685.84s] turnaround Etc and we&#39;ve seen it over
[1687.519s] and over and over now throughout the
[1688.799s] years we went through a bunch last week
[1690.6s] by the way if you missed last week&#39;s
[1692.08s] podcast I would definitely watch that
[1693.919s] first if you missed two weeks ago with
[1696.32s] Brendan Ahern I would definitely watch
[1698.279s] that first but uh we do have a lot of
[1700.279s] good stuff that we&#39;re covering so so
[1701.799s] that&#39;s the theme
[1703.679s] here now uh people are intending that
[1707.559s] the Fed easing cycle terminal rate will
[1710.12s] be at
[1712.08s] 290 I&#39;ll believe it when I see it I
[1714.88s] think they might get down to
[1717.399s] 350 and be good enough there because
[1720.279s] just as they&#39;re coming down inflation&#39;s
[1722.08s] going to be more volatile than they
[1724.44s] expect and we&#39;ve been saying this for a
[1725.96s] while they&#39;ve got to let inflation run
[1727.6s] above 3% for 3 to 5 years to bring down
[1730.76s] debt to GDP that&#39;s the only way they&#39;re
[1732.24s] going to do
[1734.76s] it just like they did post World War two
[1738.32s] when debt to GDP also ran 120% debt to
[1743.32s] GDP
[1745.159s] next Chinese economy-wide prices in
[1748.96s] longest decline since
[1750.799s] 1999 so I guess a lot of people see this
[1754.159s] and they say don&#39;t invest in
[1755.919s] China I see this and I look at every
[1758.6s] single time you&#39;ve had this level
[1763.24s] of price decline was a generational
[1767.44s] opportunity to earn outsized excess
[1770.32s] returns by buying Chinese equities so
[1773.24s] that&#39;s just how I&#39;m wired and if you go
[1775.039s] back and you look at all these instances
[1776.64s] you&#39;re going to see the exact same thing
[1779.279s] um unless you believe day doesn&#39;t follow
[1781.76s] night and it will be night forever uh
[1784.559s] and um so far we just haven&#39;t found that
[1787.32s] in any instance of history but uh maybe
[1790.76s] this will be the first time but the the
[1792.32s] way I always think about these things is
[1794.88s] the world only ends once and um and if
[1798.799s] and if this is the time you have a lot
[1800.64s] more to worry about than your stock
[1802.2s] portfolio so I I&#39;ll leave it at that I
[1804.96s] mean there&#39;s no
[1806.48s] way that China collapses and the rest of
[1810.919s] the world you know I had a friend who
[1813.679s] passed away and he used to say
[1816.679s] uh when the US catches a cold Europe
[1820.279s] gets
[1821.2s] AIDS I he was trying you know he was
[1824.679s] trying to get a point across uh I think
[1827.36s] it&#39;s a simp
[1829.159s] situation uh yes us is strong to stand
[1832.399s] on its own but if China really caught an
[1835.44s] aggressive cold there&#39;s no way we don&#39;t
[1838.72s] at least get a flu uh in that
[1841.36s] environment so so the point is that
[1845.0s] these become opportunities day follows
[1847.039s] night etc
[1848.36s] etc uh 10year Break Even rate is at the
[1851.76s] lowest ever 2.0 so we know the cuts are
[1854.44s] happening TSA passenger volumes continue
[1856.84s] to increase above 20 19 levels you can
[1859.2s] see the data here well above it and
[1861.48s] continue to do that that&#39;s great for
[1863.2s] Boeing that&#39;s the only reason I bring
[1864.84s] that up uh China&#39;s CPI actually ticked
[1867.679s] up that&#39;s that&#39;s not looking that&#39;s
[1870.48s] looking less like deflation so the year
[1875.399s] onye next
[1879.44s] is China CPI year on-ear food is is
[1882.88s] coming up all these things are positive
[1884.919s] that means their rates will start to
[1886.12s] come up that means their currency will
[1887.519s] start to come up and uh all the things
[1890.24s] that we want to see
[1892.08s] there uh percent of unprofitable
[1894.72s] companies you know the big case that you
[1896.76s] see people making against small caps is
[1900.76s] that oh 41% of them are unprofitable
[1905.679s] well that has always been the case right
[1909.799s] before they have their biggest rallies
[1912.039s] why because
[1915.72s] they do their best after the first fed
[1919.039s] cut and what that means is these
[1921.039s] unprofitable companies the number one
[1922.639s] thing they need is cheap capital in the
[1925.88s] debt and Equity markets and that&#39;s a
[1927.6s] function of lowering rates and that&#39;s
[1929.36s] when these things absolutely take off so
[1932.039s] the fact so when people say well they
[1933.96s] can&#39;t do well because 41% are
[1935.36s] unprofitable look at the last four times
[1937.36s] that they did well uh you had instances
[1940.24s] where a higher percentage or an equal
[1942.2s] percentage in the case of the early
[1943.919s] 2000s uh were unprofitable and that that
[1948.039s] was at the beginning of the easing cycle
[1949.96s] and then they took off while the large
[1952.76s] quality uh took a a a long back
[1958.159s] seat uh okay mag 7 we already covered
[1962.96s] that this is from Matt
[1966.2s] sermino I think he works for Tom
[1969.679s] Lee below our historical
[1976.84s] uninversity average one-year forward
[1979.12s] Total return is plus
[1981.48s] 16.6% uh four out of six stocks ended
[1984.08s] higher a more balanced picture for those
[1985.799s] saying the yield curve
[2006.76s] uninversity recently had and coming out
[2009.919s] of that you had that
[2012.08s] uninversity
[2014.43s] [Music]
[2016.799s] yourarf out is the last couple examples
[2021.679s] was 2019 before covid and the great
[2024.88s] financial crisis so they say oh only bad
[2026.919s] things can happen but what they&#39;re
[2028.96s] missing is the demographics in the
[2030.72s] background that are more similar to the
[2033.48s] baby boom uh we had in the early 80s
[2036.0s] that led to 20 years of prosperity
[2038.679s] uh versus the Gen X um uh kind of um
[2044.36s] demographic pothole that we had in 2000
[2048.24s] and
[2049.399s] 2008 My Generation only had 65 million
[2052.599s] people relative to the Boomers who had
[2054.159s] 80 and the Millennials now have uh a big
[2057.0s] generation so so that demand like you
[2059.72s] saw in the early 80s is going to be
[2061.52s] similar to right now so that uninversity
[2067.919s] very good things uh increase in
[2070.599s] volatility from July to November of
[2073.76s] presidential election
[2076.2s] years and then it peaks in November and
[2079.24s] comes right back down that&#39;s what we&#39;re
[2080.679s] seeing now uh yield curve suggests
[2083.24s] higher vix for years we covered that
[2085.28s] overweight consumer discretionary real
[2087.44s] wage growth is positive okay so consumer
[2092.079s] discretionary companies like Vans like
[2096.399s] uh you know Nike like Lulu like um all
[2099.839s] these things and even Amazon I&#39;ll say
[2102.2s] even though we took profits on Amazon
[2104.0s] because we had such a huge run from Fall
[2106.32s] of 2022 buying in the hole in March of
[2108.88s] 2023 we rang the register on that but I
[2111.839s] think a lot of discretionary are going
[2113.76s] to start doing well against all
[2115.88s] consensus as these Cuts kick in and
[2118.04s] lower people&#39;s interest rates and credit
[2119.64s] card bills and all that stuff uh and the
[2122.32s] consumer is so relatively delevered from
[2125.72s] the great financial crisis there&#39;s so
[2127.839s] much room for them to relever it&#39;s
[2130.04s] astounding um consumer discretionary has
[2134.079s] historically outperformed following the
[2137.079s] tightening Cycles okay and then um you
[2142.0s] see discretionary
[2145.64s] versus S&amp;P 500 you have the tightening
[2148.88s] cycle that ends and then they start to
[2151.24s] outperform and that&#39;s where we are right
[2153.839s] now so we&#39;re going to continue to look
[2156.16s] for more opportunities in discretionary
[2159.119s] as well we we&#39;ve already got a number of
[2161.16s] them we&#39;ve got goose is a smaller
[2163.359s] position we&#39;ve got uh VF cor we&#39;ve got a
[2166.48s] number of others as well uh the
[2169.079s] destocking cycle which is which has been
[2171.64s] the theme why has this been so important
[2174.0s] well everything that we bought in the
[2175.44s] hole is working like crazy because the
[2177.72s] dstock to restock like your gener up uh
[2181.359s] basically double off the lows like your
[2183.76s] Stanley Black and&amp; Decker just coming
[2185.319s] out of the hole uh Etc so we&#39;re going to
[2187.88s] see more of that and uh believe it or
[2190.079s] not we&#39;re going to see a similar
[2191.599s] situation in Intel I know that one&#39;s a
[2194.079s] controversial one we&#39;re going to cover a
[2195.48s] number of things on that this week we
[2197.52s] did a major one on that about two three
[2199.8s] weeks ago after the earnings call so go
[2202.0s] back and look at that we&#39;re not going to
[2203.04s] do a whole another hour on that uh
[2205.359s] nothing has really changed other than
[2207.0s] that they&#39;re going to get a little
[2207.96s] liquidity they&#39;ll sell off Mobil ey
[2209.72s] they&#39;ll sell off uh this other uh big
[2213.359s] and unnecessary division that was bought
[2215.119s] right before Ginger came in they paid
[2218.04s] for both of them at 15 billion they&#39;ll
[2220.0s] probably sell them for 7 billion raise
[2221.56s] some cash not do the German Factor
[2224.52s] Factory all these other things will kick
[2226.119s] into gear the government will be forced
[2227.72s] to give them the money that they
[2228.76s] promised them and then all of a sudden
[2230.48s] you got a$ 30 and $40 stock and then we
[2232.599s] figure out is it really going to be
[2234.359s] worth 60 to 100 or do we take the
[2236.64s] profits again in the high 40s and call
[2238.8s] it a day uh we&#39;ll see where it is then
[2242.56s] but I would not bet against it so
[2248.16s] next uh Equity performance in different
[2250.4s] interest rate
[2252.52s] environments International equities and
[2257.76s] value
[2260.8s] uh percent value percent
[2265.8s] growth okay so when you have a value
[2268.319s] International tilt they do best in a 4
[2273.359s] to
[2274.24s] 5% range um that&#39;s when they do best
[2278.24s] relative to us equities I think we&#39;re
[2280.8s] going you know to four pretty quick and
[2283.599s] whether we go a lot lower than that uh I
[2287.04s] think remains to be seen and and and if
[2288.88s] we do go lower than that it will be over
[2291.16s] a longer period of time so again the
[2292.839s] next 12 to 24 months favors that
[2299.16s] positioning next
[2302.88s] is now this is interesting the August
[2305.64s] 2024 rent growth is flowing year on-year
[2308.16s] according to Bank of America internal
[2310.04s] data yet the owner&#39;s equivalent rent
[2312.2s] spiked up this month so again that&#39;s a a
[2315.56s] constant push and
[2316.88s] pull We Believe owner equivalent uh rent
[2320.56s] contined to moderate after an unexpected
[2323.119s] Rebound in July it didn&#39;t uh which is
[2326.119s] why you&#39;re getting 25 basis points
[2328.48s] versus 50 next week uh Japanese Yen
[2332.56s] continues to roll over I think the right
[2336.28s] after the fed Cuts you&#39;re going to see
[2338.64s] the bank of Japan hike which is going to
[2341.64s] create a little more turbulence for the
[2344.92s] mag 7 again in October why because the
[2349.119s] carry trade is going to continue to
[2350.599s] unwind which was borrowing for
[2352.56s] effectively free and using that money to
[2356.68s] buy the mag 7 so as
[2361.839s] the bank of Japan hikes
[2366.24s] and uh
[2368.4s] um and
[2370.28s] people uh come out of that trade they&#39;re
[2373.319s] going they&#39;re the The Leverage is going
[2375.079s] to come out of the mag s so I think
[2376.76s] we&#39;re going to see continued volatility
[2378.4s] to mag s at least till late October uh
[2381.72s] that is I caveat that by I think the
[2385.88s] next week and a half into the cuts I
[2387.56s] think they could rip rip higher as a
[2389.359s] fake out um before this happens and then
[2393.24s] you know they&#39;ll get back to at or
[2396.0s] slightly above highs and then the FED
[2399.28s] will cut Bank of Japan will hike and
[2402.76s] they&#39;ll roll back over so just keep an
[2404.599s] eye on the end is is what I&#39;m trying to
[2406.44s] say to you in a Cliffs notes version uh
[2410.24s] JP Morgan tempers earnings optimism
[2412.52s] leading Bank stocks down so that was
[2415.68s] um uh Jamie Diamond again talking about
[2418.319s] Net Insurance income we as we said uh
[2421.2s] got out of all of our banks those had
[2423.079s] huge runs except for that we did keep
[2426.56s] our so we took profits on um
[2431.64s] city and Bank of America what we did
[2434.96s] keep is the Regional Bank K basket we
[2439.28s] think that&#39;s going to continue to
[2440.76s] outperform even though it&#39;s gone up a
[2442.4s] lot for us uh these others we&#39;d like to
[2445.119s] buy back hopefully late October November
[2447.319s] if they fall a lot uh in anticipation of
[2450.56s] a 2025 late 2024 25 Investment Banking
[2454.68s] cycle but I don&#39;t think they&#39;re going to
[2455.839s] get cheap cheapap enough for us to buy
[2457.599s] back in but my guess is we&#39;ll see 10 20%
[2461.76s] pullbacks um but we we had monster runs
[2464.599s] in those
[2465.88s] so manufacturing is struggling to take
[2468.599s] off but it&#39;s above that lowest desile
[2471.76s] where it got earlier in the
[2474.72s] year uh manufacturing headwind set to
[2477.92s] ease with the onset of global monetary
[2480.48s] policy easing cycle that&#39;s a big deal
[2483.92s] and what you can see here percent of
[2485.72s] central banks in easing mode push
[2487.68s] forward by nine months every time that
[2489.72s] happens manufacturing turns around
[2491.92s] manufacturing pmis follow that easing
[2494.28s] cycle and this time will be no different
[2496.44s] and there are a lot of small and midcap
[2498.04s] in those uh buckets X recessions the
[2502.599s] first fed cut has marked the trough in
[2505.76s] US ISM Manufacturing PMI again we had
[2509.96s] two recessions in two years 2020 and
[2512.28s] 2022 first two quarters of 2022 negative
[2515.2s] GDP technical recession this will be a
[2518.76s] cut into a non- recession even if you
[2521.52s] look at GDP now we&#39;re nowhere near
[2523.8s] negative GDP you would need two
[2525.52s] consecutive quarters so therefore uh
[2528.839s] you&#39;re going to
[2531.0s] see ISM start to turn up uh just like
[2534.4s] you do in the non- recessionary period
[2536.52s] manufacturing moves in sync with
[2537.88s] financial conditions the outside Gap
[2540.2s] that has opened up is unsustainable so
[2542.4s] you see this Open Jaw fish mouth this
[2545.079s] will converge just as it does every time
[2547.599s] the last time it got this far apart you
[2551.96s] saw in
[2554.04s] 2002 and sure enough it caught up again
[2557.72s] the 2002 to 2007 period everything is
[2560.52s] syncing up
[2564.04s] um EPS growth projections continue to
[2567.76s] Trend up across all
[2570.64s] regions this is the mag 7 again earnings
[2574.0s] just a reminder and for new viewers
[2576.28s] magnificent 7 earnings growth collapsing
[2578.44s] from 53% down
[2580.44s] to 18% to to down to 16% while the
[2586.72s] unmagnify from negative earnings growth
[2589.72s] to all the way back to uh low double
[2592.839s] digit 12% in the fourth quarter and
[2595.559s] Beyond double digits all of next year
[2598.16s] that&#39;s why you&#39;re going to see a lot of
[2599.24s] those stocks Left Behind double and
[2602.24s] triple um sentiment is optimistic but
[2606.04s] not euphoric which is what leads me to
[2607.88s] believe we can have some strength into
[2609.8s] that first cut and then from there get
[2612.0s] cautious we&#39;ll see how that plays out uh
[2614.599s] Bank of America analysts have been
[2615.92s] making the most downgrades relative to
[2617.839s] upgrades within Staples Staples are
[2620.04s] overpriced by the way um and um up and
[2624.839s] they&#39;ve been making the most upgrades
[2626.16s] versus downgrades in consumer
[2627.8s] discretionary where we think there&#39;s
[2629.04s] opportunity same as Industrials and
[2631.28s] materials uh so we got to pay attention
[2633.28s] to all that I think the Staples and uh
[2637.119s] certainly the utilities trade I think
[2638.559s] that&#39;s gotten long in the tooth in the
[2640.079s] short term discount retailers
[2642.359s] underperform luxury retailers when oil
[2646.24s] prices
[2648.4s] rise
[2651.8s] um so just count luxury year on
[2657.64s] year
[2659.319s] WTI so the implication of this is with
[2662.72s] oil prices coming
[2665.52s] down we should be
[2668.319s] nearing yeah that&#39;s interesting that&#39;s
[2670.88s] kind of like what you saw in 2009 and
[2674.16s] what you saw
[2675.68s] in
[2677.92s] 2002 similar
[2681.0s] situation and then all of a sudden it
[2682.839s] reverse so these you know the Dollar
[2684.559s] Generals of the world and the Dollar
[2685.839s] Trees I keep looking at them I&#39;m going
[2688.119s] to want to get involved in some way I&#39;m
[2691.079s] just not there yet we&#39;re still doing
[2693.559s] work
[2695.319s] um big surprise was o inflation we got
[2699.2s] that wage growth is growth is improving
[2702.2s] across all income groups with lower
[2704.2s] income households still outpacing other
[2707.119s] cohorts so again you know I think some
[2710.2s] of the issue because if you look at
[2711.76s] Walmart yeah Walmart&#39;s had the trade
[2713.64s] down that&#39;s worked well but their
[2715.079s] execution has been Superior I mean you
[2717.119s] walked into Dollar General it was just a
[2720.04s] complete you know uh trash can is
[2723.52s] basically what it comes down to so I
[2725.559s] think they&#39;ll fix their execution
[2727.48s] and
[2729.96s] um they&#39;ll come back either them or
[2732.839s] Dollar Tree we&#39;re looking at both us
[2734.88s] household income uh that continues to
[2739.0s] rise this is from brandan Ahern
[2742.16s] yesterday Boba according with their Hong
[2744.119s] Kong filing bought 5.6 million shares
[2747.68s] equivalent to
[2749.359s] 73,8 yards which accounted to 6.2% of
[2753.359s] their adrs volume worth noting uh 10c
[2757.0s] 2.68 million of their Hong Kong shares
[2758.8s] today my TR but I suspect many will look
[2761.359s] back in a year and say how did we not
[2762.92s] see the signs that&#39;s exactly right I
[2765.839s] mean that&#39;s the one thing I give the
[2767.2s] Chinese credit for you know the US
[2772.079s] managers when Jensen Wong is selling a
[2775.4s] half a billion dollars of stock just as
[2777.16s] he splits the stock to the retail
[2779.04s] investors who got smoke down
[2781.4s] 30% he announces a you know $50 billion
[2786.48s] buyback to absorb his sales and uh right
[2792.72s] when the stock is trading at 41 time
[2795.64s] sales is when he announces the buyback
[2797.52s] the Chinese companies only do the
[2799.04s] BuyBacks when the stock is cheap uh the
[2801.64s] Americans do the BuyBacks when the stock
[2803.44s] is expensive so they can lay off their
[2805.04s] own stock and it&#39;s uh uh you just see it
[2807.96s] over and over there are very few
[2809.599s] management that actually aggressively
[2811.68s] buy their stock back in the hole in the
[2813.16s] US and uh and it&#39;s it&#39;s a shame so again
[2817.4s] keeping an eye on this XLE to xpy ratio
[2820.92s] getting towards an
[2822.52s] extreme Chinese uh we covered that with
[2826.0s] the prices this is from Seth golden the
[2828.4s] current regime has been the worst from
[2830.8s] small caps relative to large caps since
[2832.92s] 2000 again going back to our our same
[2835.599s] analog but after that was a long Runway
[2838.119s] of small cap out performance so you can
[2839.96s] see that
[2842.8s] here biggest drop between Regional and
[2846.04s] large Banks
[2847.8s] occurred as you would expect during the
[2850.52s] SB Silicon Valley Bank in 2023 Regional
[2854.2s] banks have underperformed large caps
[2856.2s] ever since but that is the largest
[2858.48s] bullish Divergence I&#39;ve seen in almost
[2860.319s] any chart as RSI fails to make lower
[2862.64s] lows with relative performance banking
[2864.48s] lower lows uh the bottom for regional
[2867.92s] Banks and large Banks may very well have
[2869.76s] formed as Regional Banks versus large
[2872.68s] Banks may very well has formed as rate
[2874.64s] cut and certainty developed in June
[2876.04s] Regional banks are like gearing up for
[2877.599s] Q4 out performance and keep in mind a
[2880.24s] lot of the regional banks are what
[2881.44s] they&#39;re small cap stocks so this is what
[2882.8s] he&#39;s talking about with the Divergence
[2884.0s] with the RSI going up uh making higher
[2886.8s] lows while the um small small Banks
[2890.2s] relative to large banks are going down
[2893.359s] this usually precedes this which is
[2895.48s] interesting that we kept our K and uh
[2898.64s] sold our C and BAC over the summer at
[2902.88s] huge profits
[2905.4s] um okay this this is another one from
[2907.559s] Seth via Tom Lee midcycle rate Cuts
[2911.2s] equals winner winner chicken dinner
[2913.599s] after rate
[2915.16s] cut S&amp;P higher every single time 1 to 12
[2918.64s] months
[2920.76s] later
[2922.8s] so what he&#39;s saying is if it&#39;s not a
[2926.0s] recession which we just laid out why
[2927.64s] it&#39;s not a recession what happens one
[2929.16s] month out after the first
[2931.599s] cut uh equals plus 5.1% for the S&amp;P 3
[2936.2s] months out Plus 99.7% on average and 6
[2940.119s] months out 14% with the 13 and 6 month
[2944.4s] win ratio is 100% so unless you feel
[2948.599s] that GDP is going to go from 2% to
[2951.799s] negative for the next two quarters you
[2954.359s] want to bet on equities being up on a
[2957.64s] you know a one to two months after the
[2959.96s] first cut 3 months for Shore 6 months
[2962.799s] for for darn Shore and it could be more
[2964.599s] meaningful Than People expect uh average
[2967.72s] Del duration of a bull market not
[2970.319s] following a former recession is 33
[2972.72s] months that would take the S&amp;P to May of
[2975.48s] 2025 and the average bull market gain
[2977.48s] for light conditions has been
[2980.28s] 63.6% which would take the S&amp;P to 5852
[2983.92s] but notice something else if the bull
[2985.2s] market ended in July it would be the
[2986.96s] shortest bull market in history tied
[2988.88s] with that from 2020 to
[2991.16s] 2022 question do you think the stock
[2993.88s] market would suffer the shortest bull
[2995.96s] markets in history back toback
[2997.2s] occurrence table informs that would be
[2998.92s] the lowest of all possible outcomes the
[3001.52s] other thing I would keep in mind here is
[3006.64s] that um here it&#39;s saying that it didn&#39;t
[3010.88s] follow
[3012.359s] recession I would assert that we did
[3015.24s] follow recession because we had that
[3017.04s] recession in the first two quarters of
[3019.88s] 2022 which wasn&#39;t declared an official
[3022.28s] recession but it was a technical
[3023.72s] recession therefore this duration
[3027.48s] should be uh not an average of 33 months
[3032.64s] it should be an average of 61 months
[3034.88s] because it was preceded by a recession
[3039.04s] and therefore the averages go and the
[3041.319s] gains go dramatically higher because the
[3044.04s] duration of the bull market is
[3046.559s] dramatically
[3049.04s] longer next early stages of inventory
[3052.16s] building is typically sign of recovery
[3054.04s] and or expansion cycle not a sign of
[3056.4s] econ economic weakness or recession this
[3058.4s] is another way to talk about the dstock
[3060.799s] restock cycle that we&#39;ve been pounding
[3062.319s] the table on for 6 months
[3066.88s] um and you can see here he&#39;s referring
[3069.96s] to Merchant wholesale inventory this
[3071.76s] looks a lot like what 2000 to 2002 right
[3075.28s] before you took off 2009 to 2010 before
[3078.2s] you took off and 2000 to 2001 as you
[3082.079s] were taking off so um there you go
[3087.88s] and I think we got to the last chart wow
[3091.4s] that was a lot of data in a short amount
[3092.76s] of time moving along we covered the
[3094.96s] quote of the week another one
[3096.319s] opportunities coming frequently when it
[3097.799s] rains gold pull out the bucket not the
[3099.839s] thimble that&#39;s from Warren Buffett and
[3101.839s] then PayPal this is from Alex Chris
[3105.0s] PayPal&#39;s largest marketing campaign ever
[3108.0s] starring Will Ferrell this campaign
[3110.28s] reintroduces customers to a whole new
[3112.68s] PayPal highlighting how easy and
[3114.68s] rewarding it is to shop with PayPal
[3117.0s] everywhere both online and in stores
[3119.319s] this is Will frell doing
[3122.16s] his best work and uh and making people
[3126.4s] laugh and making people remember PayPal
[3128.599s] and PayPal&#39;s Cash Back Rewards uh I will
[3131.44s] not play it for you now but you can
[3133.24s] check it out yourself sentiment came in
[3135.52s] a little bit bullishness down to 31%
[3137.88s] bearishness up to
[3139.48s] 31% uh National Association of active
[3142.04s] investment managers Equity exposure
[3143.839s] dropped down to 71.9%
[3147.079s] again no man&#39;s land not an extreme I
[3149.04s] think we&#39;ll get an extreme before that
[3151.079s] cut I&#39;d love to see them get into the
[3153.28s] 90s or
[3154.839s] 100% Alibaba Merchants hail adoption of
[3157.76s] 10 cents WeChat pay on tbal and t-all so
[3161.559s] basically WeChat has the uh like a
[3164.359s] billion users in China and now alibaba&#39;s
[3168.0s] allowing them to use that form of
[3169.599s] payment on tbal and t-all if they don&#39;t
[3171.44s] want to use alipe which I think is a
[3173.319s] good thing not a bad thing PB consider
[3177.44s] three uh reserve requirement ratio cut
[3180.359s] ahead of us fed
[3182.119s] Cuts uh so you know more talk towards
[3185.119s] easing Alibaba yields good results from
[3186.92s] three-year inspection says regulator
[3189.04s] they closed out the inspection that
[3190.599s] started the collapse 3 years ago so
[3192.72s] that&#39;s good Yellen says she would
[3194.839s] welcome a visit by her Chinese
[3196.52s] counterpart that&#39;s good China&#39;s Central
[3199.28s] Bank sees room to lower Banks reserve
[3201.44s] requirement ratio they are now saying
[3204.119s] this could come as soon as September
[3207.28s] which would be good which is now uh
[3210.48s] Alibaba looks beyond Chinese Supply
[3212.72s] suppliers as additional tarff threat
[3214.52s] looms so what did they do
[3223.119s] here uh they&#39;re talking about IDC growth
[3226.2s] of
[3228.2s] 32% 20 trillion business so they&#39;re
[3231.16s] growing super fast so they can build
[3232.64s] another Alibaba on top of the Alibaba
[3234.839s] they have with the international
[3236.0s] incoming years Alibaba join to join
[3238.44s] stock connect from Tuesday in potential
[3239.96s] 12 billion boost uh it&#39;s now looking
[3242.559s] like more everyone&#39;s updating their um
[3245.319s] estimates since the first few days of
[3247.119s] buying has been pretty aggressive
[3249.2s] Alibaba Logistics arm La launches next
[3252.319s] day delivery in Europe builds new hubs
[3254.68s] this wasn&#39;t even part of their business
[3256.2s] years ago now it&#39;s going to become a
[3257.559s] major part of their business Alibaba is
[3259.96s] battling with teu parent P pindu Duo
[3262.599s] Jack M says that&#39;s a good thing yeah it
[3264.559s] walked them up out of their slumber
[3267.0s] uh steadfast blah blah blah so Jack Ma&#39;s
[3269.72s] back in the picture that&#39;s good Z urges
[3272.2s] efforts to hit annual growth Target amid
[3274.599s] Rising doubt 5% growth Target so they&#39;re
[3277.359s] going to probably juice the economy a
[3279.92s] little bit before the end of the
[3281.68s] year China to cut rates on $5 trillion
[3285.0s] of mortgages as soon as September some
[3287.72s] banks are making final preparations for
[3289.359s] rate adjustments Move May spur household
[3293.0s] consumption so that&#39;s a good thing not a
[3295.24s] bad thing uh this is from Brendan Ahern
[3298.04s] who runs kweb by the way Mainland
[3300.72s] investors
[3301.839s] bu Hong Kong 3.5 billion of shares net
[3306.88s] of sales today that&#39;s about a half a
[3309.16s] billion dollars of us buying today alone
[3312.04s] so what did they anticipate in the first
[3314.76s] uh 12 to 18 months that it would do 20
[3319.2s] to uh 20 to to4 40 billion dollars of
[3322.72s] new buyers over the first year and a
[3324.24s] half they&#39;ve probably done uh maybe
[3327.079s] about a billion and a half two billion
[3328.599s] in the first two three days uh so that&#39;s
[3332.079s] moving right on track Alibaba to benefit
[3334.28s] more from crossb link trading history of
[3336.16s] 10cent mitan shows 10cent gained 23% in
[3340.079s] the first 6 months after joining stock
[3341.68s] connect remember they just joined stock
[3343.44s] connect two three days ago while Maan
[3346.359s] and Zi more than doubled over 12 months
[3349.44s] after they joined the stock connect so
[3351.64s] keep that in mind ladies and gentlemen
[3353.64s] uh this could be more meaningful than
[3355.319s] anyone even expects
[3357.559s] Chinese chipm shows progress with new
[3360.4s] euv patent from domestic lithography
[3362.68s] Champion again put on the tariffs they
[3364.96s] figure it out
[3366.72s] themselves or the the uh
[3370.24s] sanctions inflation Rises 2.5% in August
[3373.4s] less than expected Intel is exploring
[3375.68s] the sale of part of the stake of mobile
[3378.0s] ey as well as its Network and Edge
[3380.44s] business so they&#39;re going to create some
[3381.599s] liquidity and that&#39;s the key with these
[3383.319s] turnaround businesses is the margin of
[3385.96s] saf has to be large enough that they
[3388.079s] have outs they have things that they can
[3390.039s] sell to create the runway for their
[3391.68s] turnaround plan to kick in uh just like
[3394.44s] it did with all the others that we&#39;ve
[3395.76s] done over the last few years that you&#39;ve
[3397.2s] been listening this one will be no
[3399.28s] different this definitely feels a little
[3400.96s] hairier but when you&#39;re trading a
[3402.799s] tangible book and you still got you know
[3404.92s] it&#39;s amazing how aggressively people
[3407.16s] talk like they&#39;re going out of business
[3408.559s] because they only did 52 billion of
[3411.76s] Revenue in the last 12 months I mean
[3414.119s] when you got $52 billion coming in the
[3416.68s] door you can cut a few jobs and you can
[3418.64s] sell a few non-core assets to live
[3420.52s] another day to turn the corner to catch
[3422.76s] the next cycle and to have a double or
[3424.76s] triple in your stock over the next 3 to
[3426.44s] 5 years um and you don&#39;t even have to
[3428.88s] predict the future to get those type of
[3430.4s] results but people are impatient and
[3432.319s] they can&#39;t handle the short-term
[3433.48s] volatility so they they sell their stock
[3435.359s] to people like me uh who step in and buy
[3437.88s] it and then you&#39;ll see the activists
[3439.52s] come in and and it will be Off to the
[3441.2s] Races as an FYI the board was meeting in
[3443.76s] the last couple of days so I&#39;m sure
[3445.119s] we&#39;ll see some announcements out of that
[3447.16s] in the coming week Mark Cuban warns
[3449.839s] taxing unrealized gains will kill the
[3451.839s] stock market insists Harris actually
[3454.2s] won&#39;t do it I mean that&#39;s kind of the
[3456.44s] craziest statement I&#39;ve ever heard if
[3458.359s] you&#39;re dating someone and they say I&#39;m
[3460.4s] going to kill you but you kind of think
[3462.559s] they won&#39;t actually do it do you keep
[3464.359s] dating them and ask them to marry you I
[3466.039s] would say the answer is a hard no uh the
[3469.0s] fact that they would have a thought like
[3470.72s] that that seems logical from their
[3473.119s] framework of thinking to me is a is a
[3475.72s] non starter that is not someone I would
[3477.68s] trust with running a$7 trillion business
[3480.24s] called uh US government allocations uh
[3483.319s] that thinks in that manner so I I you
[3486.44s] know I don&#39;t really you know uh want to
[3490.64s] spend any time talking about any social
[3493.0s] stuff that&#39;s not that important to me
[3494.52s] and it doesn&#39;t matter as it relates to
[3496.839s] the stock market so you can talk about
[3499.16s] all the reasons why one candidate is
[3501.44s] better than the other for for that
[3502.72s] reason but with policies like this
[3505.28s] whether or not they will be passed the
[3507.119s] fact that they&#39;re even being
[3509.079s] broached uh and not thinking about
[3511.92s] second and third order effects tells me
[3514.799s] uh of uh the level of analysis of the
[3517.839s] close advisors of the people that are
[3519.92s] putting out ideas like this is not at
[3522.16s] the level that is currently sufficient
[3524.319s] so either get new advisors and change
[3526.0s] your ideas or
[3528.599s] um you know hopefully it gets blocked
[3531.2s] but uh uh it&#39;s interesting that Cuban
[3533.839s] was saying that because he is a is a Big
[3536.359s] Time supporter of the people putting out
[3538.0s] those ideas uh PayPal expands role in
[3541.119s] Shopify payments what&#39;s in the card so
[3543.16s] they&#39;re just they&#39;re just hitting on all
[3544.559s] cylinders they&#39;re they&#39;re getting it
[3545.76s] done here&#39;s a quote from an analyst
[3548.359s] named Hutchinson if intel can ride out
[3550.559s] the storm it could reach a very
[3552.119s] profitable state in 2026 or 2027 if it
[3555.44s] succeeds with a new manufacturing
[3557.0s] process called 18a designed to create a
[3561.64s] the latest Cutting Edge chips the
[3563.72s] problem is you have to wait till then
[3565.28s] the problem with this analyst is he
[3566.76s] doesn&#39;t realize the stock market&#39;s a
[3568.119s] discounting me mechanism so if you get a
[3570.64s] little liquidity this the end of this
[3572.28s] year you get into 2025 when people are
[3574.88s] in 2025 they&#39;re not looking at 2025
[3577.039s] numbers they&#39;re looking at 2026 and 2027
[3579.559s] numbers so if there&#39;s a Runway the the
[3582.28s] stock starts to price that in very very
[3583.88s] quickly which means 40 50 bucks and if
[3586.72s] they actually execute on it it could
[3588.48s] mean 50 to 100 bucks uh so we&#39;ll just
[3590.839s] have to wait and see how that all plays
[3592.799s] out uh Intel Core Ultra V AKA lunar Lake
[3598.039s] goes official takes on
[3600.48s] arms uh for the ultimate AI laptop
[3603.559s] experience they control this base 40
[3605.48s] million shipped uh this year alone
[3608.64s] better than estimates it&#39;s going to
[3610.28s] continue to go here&#39;s the press release
[3612.2s] Will Farrell goes shopping everywhere in
[3613.92s] PayPal&#39;s biggest US campaign ever you
[3616.76s] should watch the the ad it&#39;s pretty
[3618.92s] funny and I think it&#39;s going to be very
[3620.64s] memorable for people PPI inflation data
[3623.64s] was tame in August um
[3627.76s] okay Lulu Lemon is seeing a Slowdown in
[3629.64s] his women&#39;s business has it reached a
[3632.16s] ceiling the stock is definitely pricing
[3634.599s] in a lot of bad news I don&#39;t know if
[3636.039s] it&#39;s pricing in all the bad news but
[3637.72s] again it just really felt like a gap and
[3640.96s] uh Gap was big when I was young and it&#39;s
[3643.72s] just never come
[3645.76s] back I think Lulu can come back but
[3648.52s] without chip Wilson in the picture in a
[3650.72s] material
[3652.039s] way I don&#39;t know you know there&#39;s a lot
[3654.44s] of of comp competitors um
[3659.119s] Athleta there&#39;s one with a V Viola or
[3661.88s] something like that Alo there&#39;s a number
[3664.599s] of them we&#39;ll see what happens with that
[3666.119s] I&#39;m going to keep looking at it shelter
[3667.799s] inflation makes bigger rate Cuts less
[3669.88s] likely that&#39;s from Nick timos which
[3672.0s] means 25 job jobless claims inch up to
[3674.96s] 230 but still no sign of rising layoffs
[3677.319s] we&#39;ll probably get that just after the
[3679.0s] election which would imply 50 basis
[3681.079s] points in one of the November or
[3683.559s] December
[3684.599s] meetings this from from Jacob sonen
[3686.68s] shine at Baron consumer staple stocks
[3688.92s] are looking pricey it&#39;s time to sell we
[3690.799s] agree with him on a lot of
[3694.599s] them
[3696.64s] um uh here&#39;s a hit piece on Intel but
[3700.16s] there was a one line that was useful it
[3703.2s] says gelsinger insists the time to reap
[3705.0s] the rewards is finally arriving remember
[3706.68s] his plan was four nodes in 5 years and
[3709.359s] he&#39;s actually executed on that so all
[3712.0s] the work and spend is largely in the
[3713.76s] rearview mirror now they get to actually
[3715.4s] reap the fruits of their labor he says
[3718.0s] Intel&#39;s Foundry business has engagements
[3719.72s] with the number of customers for $15
[3721.16s] billion spread out over multiple years
[3727.359s] um etc etc so I think that&#39;ll be fine
[3730.4s] ECB cut Cuts interest
[3732.68s] rate and article the week jackets and
[3735.64s] packets stock market and sentiment
[3737.16s] results we&#39;ll get through this and then
[3739.0s] get right to the ask me anything
[3741.24s] questions I thought this was going to be
[3742.359s] a short one this week but uh didn&#39;t turn
[3745.0s] out that way
[3746.799s] where have I heard that before okay so
[3749.0s] we wanted to cover Canada Goose and
[3751.52s] Baxter uh Canada Goose key points
[3754.4s] revenues continue to grow free cash flow
[3757.599s] uh recovering margins are high stock
[3759.92s] price subdued number two growing double
[3762.2s] digits in China Asia Pacific is up
[3765.359s] 25% a lot of that Asia Pacific up 25%
[3769.279s] are Chinese going to Japan to benefit
[3772.68s] from the currency uh weakness of the yen
[3776.44s] to buy Canada goose in Japan to bring
[3779.599s] back to China so a lot of this growth is
[3782.24s] because of China and everyone says China
[3783.76s] is dead simply not the case three in
[3786.24s] line with their long-term growth plan
[3787.88s] they are growing uh direct to Consumer
[3790.24s] and shrinking wholesale business to
[3791.799s] improveed margins and the customer
[3793.24s] experience number four the non jackets
[3796.64s] their windwear apparel and Footwear is
[3798.96s] up 20% year on-year so they&#39;re now
[3801.92s] moving to become an allseason brand
[3805.039s] globally very similar to what Northface
[3809.279s] did for VF Corp and others uh five new
[3813.24s] sales training in key London store led
[3817.0s] to double digigit year- on-year growth
[3819.079s] comp within 45 days they&#39;re now rolling
[3821.279s] that
[3823.2s] across all 70 stores so keep an eye on
[3827.799s] that and then if you just look back step
[3830.92s] back dis passionately what&#39;s happening
[3833.0s] revenues per share have just been going
[3834.64s] up every single year and continue to go
[3837.24s] up cash flow per share continues to go
[3839.72s] up this was a softer year 2024 but not
[3842.88s] relative to the amount that the stock
[3844.44s] price declined went from $50 down to
[3847.319s] $10
[3849.039s] um with flat for one year and now
[3852.279s] reaccelerating so that&#39;s when you find
[3854.279s] your opportunities and that&#39;s when you
[3855.64s] take advantage share counts going to
[3857.48s] come back down overall sales continue to
[3860.599s] go up and uh return on Capital remains
[3864.119s] in the low double digit range which is
[3867.52s] good um you can go through this sales
[3870.319s] were up 4% year on year which is good uh
[3874.559s] especially with the quote unquote weak
[3876.26s] [Music]
[3879.88s] consumer inventory came down which is
[3882.76s] positive they work through some of that
[3885.119s] with um sales manland China was a
[3888.76s] highlight we covered
[3890.88s] that uh three-point plan they set their
[3894.0s] foundation for the next phase of our
[3895.24s] Brandon product Evolution they got hired
[3897.119s] this guy called Hadar aurman who is a
[3900.48s] big creative director so he&#39;s launching
[3903.039s] all this stuff like the hoodies and the
[3904.76s] hats and all the secondary stuff the the
[3908.0s] uh lightweight stuff second implementing
[3909.96s] best-in-class retail execution we talked
[3912.039s] about that with the training and
[3913.44s] simplify the way we operate to become
[3915.0s] more efficient and more effective they
[3916.4s] announced the layoffs last quarter uh
[3919.359s] strong gross margins continues this
[3921.48s] year&#39;s gross margins are going to be in
[3923.039s] line with last year which are strong
[3927.0s] 65%
[3931.64s] plus just seeing if there are any key
[3934.16s] points that I want to cover
[3940.0s] here are in season collection was a very
[3942.96s] positive development which can drive the
[3944.839s] gross profit dollar growth in the long
[3946.92s] term that will bring down margins it&#39;s
[3948.88s] kind of interesting it&#39;s kind of like
[3950.16s] PayPal they actually increased cash flow
[3952.2s] but the market sold them off because the
[3953.64s] margins declined uh because a brain
[3956.92s] tree the key is their cash flow per
[3959.2s] share is going to continue to improve as
[3960.839s] they sell more products even if it&#39;s
[3962.279s] slightly lower margin products in
[3963.839s] addition to their high margin um
[3969.24s] jackets their liquidity is fine they&#39;ve
[3971.68s] got 335 million of uh borrowing capacity
[3975.16s] they always draw down this time of year
[3976.76s] in anticipation of the strong season
[3979.16s] into the holidays uh and you can see it
[3981.72s] in their cash flow uh seasonality
[3992.72s] all right
[3994.559s] and that&#39;s that backer International I
[3997.24s] thought this long-term chart was pretty
[3998.799s] valuable you&#39;ve seen in the last um 40
[4003.0s] years that they have these massive draw
[4005.96s] Downs you know basically every 20 years
[4009.68s] uh like they had in 84 to 86 in 2002 to
[4014.4s] 2004 and to lesser extent in 2009 to
[4018.0s] 2011 and then we just had in 2022 to
[4022.76s] 2024 and they always recover and we&#39;re
[4024.839s] seeing this kind of inverse Head and
[4026.559s] Shoulders kick in here which implies a
[4029.2s] measured move to uh uh
[4033.279s] 13 56 in the short term and the recovery
[4037.039s] will continue every time goes back to
[4038.68s] New highs which would be 88 plus uh over
[4042.4s] time and uh they they delivered they
[4044.359s] sold off the Kidney Care business
[4046.52s] they&#39;ll get three billion net after
[4049.16s] taxes and Banker fees which they&#39;ll use
[4052.119s] to pay down debt and if you remember our
[4054.559s] whole thesis to getting involved uh was
[4057.92s] that uh you know when no one wanted the
[4060.64s] damn stock was that they were going to
[4063.76s] separate the kidney care business which
[4065.599s] was the slow growing business which was
[4067.68s] dragging the multiple that had traded at
[4071.24s] 16 was down to 10 times and once they
[4074.24s] got rid of the kidney business you would
[4075.68s] start to see in the next 6 months a
[4077.279s] reating of the multiple so even without
[4079.52s] the business dramatically improving uh
[4081.92s] just taking the multiple from you know
[4084.48s] 11 12 times to 16 to 18 times on uh
[4088.799s] forward earnings you&#39;re looking at you
[4090.64s] know $ 45 $50 stock and then as the
[4093.24s] business recovers and grows uh it&#39;s
[4095.68s] going to go a lot higher over time as it
[4097.759s] does every single cycle so you can see
[4100.679s] the margin expansion the operating
[4102.96s] margin the earnings growth of 24%
[4105.759s] increased
[4107.56s] um so it beat guidance on both the top
[4111.04s] and bottom line um grew sales
[4116.679s] 3% they uh
[4119.799s] raised
[4122.12s] guidance on the top and bottom line they
[4125.04s] got the sale done which is what we
[4126.64s] talked about they improved operating
[4129.159s] efficiency they launched Nova
[4131.239s] MyQ they um
[4136.679s] had growth across all their sectors that
[4138.279s] was the key theme everything is hitting
[4139.759s] on all cylinders now and they&#39;ve got
[4141.839s] cash to delever back to investment grade
[4144.52s] uh and they&#39;re Off to the Races and this
[4145.88s] is why they call me turnaround Tom
[4147.4s] because I love these stories I love
[4148.759s] buying them when there&#39;s hair and then
[4150.4s] when they double and triple everyone&#39;s
[4151.679s] like how did that happen and then
[4152.88s] they&#39;re all excited after they double
[4154.359s] and triple and they&#39;re all buying zero
[4156.6s] date options when we&#39;re selling out out
[4159.6s] our stock and everyone&#39;s excited so uh
[4162.4s] pretty exciting to see all that you can
[4163.96s] go through that fear and again this is
[4166.159s] not at a level where we want to be
[4168.08s] selling a lot it&#39;s at a level where we
[4169.6s] want to be long and
[4173.239s] um I think that&#39;s it earnings uh the
[4176.279s] growth stocks IBD 50 earnings revisions
[4179.159s] in the last 60 days for the top 30
[4180.759s] weights went up 6% for this year and up
[4183.6s] 5.6% next year so that&#39;s good and
[4186.92s] materials also uh materials are down 4.6
[4191.159s] and down 4.18 so keeping an eye on that
[4194.199s] my guess is that by one or two stocks
[4196.719s] because this is not a weighted list this
[4199.199s] is just an absolute list just trying to
[4202.04s] see where that big hit was from looks
[4204.92s] like U Martin maretta is is the
[4208.56s] culprit uh so that might just be a
[4212.679s] discret
[4214.28s] situation economic data we covered most
[4217.08s] of this largely the inflation uh uh and
[4220.4s] the wholesale inflation came in better
[4221.88s] than expected jobs are a concern
[4224.52s] earnings estimates stay elevated 15%
[4227.12s] growth next year and now uh on to the
[4230.76s] ask me anything questions from our
[4232.4s] audience so for those of you who uh just
[4235.8s] like the podcast version thank you for
[4238.08s] tuning in for those of you who get value
[4239.88s] from listening to questions from the
[4241.36s] audience here we
[4243.719s] go uh been great to receive so much
[4246.28s] stock information and opinions not
[4247.92s] advice yes as we always say opinion not
[4250.6s] advice click go to hedge fund tips.com
[4253.96s] click on terms
[4255.96s] and here we go
[4258.64s] um find the quotes of the day
[4260.64s] particularly
[4261.88s] beneficial oh one you frequently mention
[4264.199s] is buffets I don&#39;t look to jump over s
[4266.4s] foot bars I look for one foot bars that
[4268.08s] I can step over how do you reconcile
[4270.0s] that quote with your turnaround Tom
[4271.6s] Investments uh Intel in particular
[4273.76s] strikes me like it might be a 7 foot bar
[4276.52s] so I would be interested in hearing your
[4278.08s] further thoughts greetings from Canada
[4279.52s] and thanks in advance so Chris um for me
[4283.159s] these are the one foot bars the seven
[4285.36s] foot bars are the ones where I have to
[4286.679s] predict the future and think that I know
[4289.6s] what the next new technology is going to
[4291.52s] be in the case of intel if they
[4294.159s] liquidate tomorrow I get my money out if
[4296.28s] they live another day I probably get
[4297.92s] double my money and if they actually
[4299.52s] execute I get Triple to quadruple of my
[4301.4s] money and it&#39;s just a question of
[4303.08s] waiting so as long as I&#39;m not on
[4305.6s] Leverage for me those are the one foot
[4307.52s] bars that turnarounds um as far as how I
[4311.679s] invest versus how some of
[4313.92s] my I you invest uh like David teer like
[4318.8s] uh Warren Buffett like Charlie
[4321.08s] Monger uh there is a difference you know
[4324.159s] and you have to do what you&#39;re best at
[4326.32s] and this is what I found that I&#39;m best
[4328.8s] at and uh superlative at over the years
[4332.159s] and I&#39;ll continue to do what I love to
[4333.639s] do I love the treasure hunts and I love
[4335.56s] the things that are the one foot bars
[4337.6s] where I don&#39;t have to overthink it I
[4338.92s] mean I don&#39;t have to stay up all night
[4341.8s] wondering if Boeing is going to sell
[4343.239s] planes next year I mean
[4346.04s] I it&#39;s a no-brainer so if I own it at
[4348.88s] 150 or 160 and it goes to 130 before it
[4354.08s] goes to 350 I don&#39;t care I&#39;m not on
[4357.159s] Leverage um and um and if it goes to 130
[4362.4s] and if we have Capital available we buy
[4364.04s] more so you know intel if it goes to 15
[4367.04s] before it goes to 50 I don&#39;t it
[4369.76s] doesn&#39;t I love it if there&#39;s if there&#39;s
[4372.159s] cash available if there&#39;s new clients on
[4374.8s] board we&#39;re going to buy more I mean
[4376.639s] that&#39;s just how we think so these are
[4378.88s] the one foot bars the seven foot bars is
[4380.88s] what you all are doing wondering if um
[4384.32s] you know nvidia&#39;s growth rate is
[4385.96s] actually cutting in half now even if
[4387.56s] they grow 4 billion a quarter so the
[4389.8s] multiple is not supportive and you wind
[4391.96s] up with these big 30 and 40% Corrections
[4395.48s] uh and then everyone gets out all at
[4396.96s] once and you have another you know zoom
[4399.88s] on your hands and I&#39;m not saying that&#39;s
[4401.44s] necessarily the case with uh Nvidia it&#39;s
[4403.4s] a great company but it&#39;s pric is what
[4404.92s] you pay values what you get it&#39;s too
[4406.52s] hard for me to guess how many more
[4407.8s] suckers are going to come in and pay 80
[4409.88s] times sales versus 40 times sales that&#39;s
[4412.44s] the 7 foot bar which I&#39;m not interested
[4414.719s] in climbing John Clark I know you&#39;ve
[4417.6s] been bearish on the dollar for a while I
[4420.52s] say bearish and right by the way uh what
[4422.84s] are your thoughts on the Euro over the
[4424.28s] longer term it&#39;s going up uh Euro&#39;s been
[4427.12s] in a range for almost two years you
[4428.88s] think you can get above 2
[4430.76s] 112 yes and a lot higher I mean um
[4436.4s] how far do I think it run it&#39;s going to
[4438.159s] run to 13710 I I I have no idea how far
[4441.44s] it can run I mean it&#39;s just a theme it&#39;s
[4448.44s] um it&#39;s the
[4450.44s] wrong it&#39;s the wrong question if you get
[4453.08s] the theme
[4454.92s] right you can
[4458.159s] play equities in such a way that you can
[4460.88s] make fortunes if you get the theme right
[4463.159s] of weakening dollar and the impact that
[4465.88s] has on International stocks and then you
[4467.84s] get a couple of the turnaround
[4469.04s] International stocks on top of it that
[4471.199s] are high quality where you don&#39;t have to
[4472.52s] guess the future you can make 6X even if
[4475.04s] the Euro only moves 12% uh versus trying
[4479.08s] to buy options on the Euro which maybe
[4481.84s] it only moves 15% and you could have
[4484.84s] made 300% buying three or four
[4487.639s] International stocks um that&#39;s the way
[4490.76s] to think about it so I don&#39;t really care
[4492.6s] about a particular level I don&#39;t think
[4494.44s] it goes goes all the way back to its
[4496.159s] alltime high but it wouldn&#39;t surprise me
[4498.28s] if it gets in the
[4501.44s] neighborhood Bob Johnson can you take a
[4504.4s] look at Badger meter ticker
[4509.159s] BMI okay let&#39;s have a look
[4515.639s] BMI uh you asking me for a short or a
[4520.159s] long I&#39;m assuming you asking me for a
[4522.88s] long
[4526.12s] and I&#39;m also assuming you&#39;re pretty new
[4528.639s] to this podcast so
[4534.44s] look everything&#39;s going great right now
[4536.92s] what do they
[4538.84s] do my guess is everything&#39;s going great
[4541.84s] and it&#39;s mostly all priced in so for me
[4545.92s] it&#39;s a pass but let&#39;s take a
[4550.32s] look cport initiates a buy at
[4553.76s] $235 where where were they at
[4556.76s] $30 all right let&#39;s
[4560.6s] see 52 *
[4565.719s] PE 10times
[4574.17s] [Music]
[4578.4s] book let&#39;s see here
[4592.719s] yeah I mean look this is a great
[4594.4s] business that will continue to go up
[4596.32s] over time but I think you&#39;re at an
[4598.36s] extreme right now it&#39;s got to rest for a
[4605.12s] while let me just take a look here
[4622.199s] so it&#39;s trading at seven times sales not
[4625.48s] bad but not great for a boring business
[4627.239s] like this
[4631.96s] um 52 times
[4636.52s] earnings let&#39;s the earnings growth
[4649.679s] you
[4653.76s] are trading at like a two and a half to
[4656.12s] three times the earnings
[4658.0s] growth yeah I I think it&#39;s priced for
[4660.32s] Perfection like if this thing pulled
[4661.8s] back 20 or 30% I&#39;d take another look but
[4665.639s] um it&#39;s a great business it&#39;s priced
[4668.199s] like that a great business I I need this
[4671.04s] thing to drop down to
[4676.08s] you know 160 to take a look and it may
[4679.12s] never do that but that&#39;s not for me I
[4681.88s] one thing I can guarantee you I&#39;m not
[4683.28s] getting a double on it over the next
[4684.6s] couple of years so I&#39;m not
[4686.36s] interested
[4688.84s] um all right Max
[4691.12s] Moore do you have any thought on VTO
[4698.72s] [Music]
[4707.159s] it&#39;s interesting I&#39;m getting a lot of um
[4710.04s] companies that have already had
[4711.28s] multibagger moves so this thing is
[4714.88s] up it&#39;s doubled in less than a year and
[4718.719s] cash flow is rolling
[4721.28s] over um so my thought is uh not for me
[4735.52s] water treatment blah blah
[4738.8s] blah yeah
[4744.32s] uh just take a look at some of the
[4746.32s] financials
[4749.239s] here revenues are pretty slow
[4753.32s] grower it&#39;s happen the earnings have
[4755.639s] been
[4758.88s] declining
[4762.12s] multiples five time sales 30 times
[4765.679s] earnings with very slow growth
[4768.4s] no no this is a promote I mean it seems
[4771.6s] like a quality business but uh let these
[4775.0s] guys get washed out and then look at it
[4776.92s] when it comes down by like
[4779.96s] 50% uh okay here&#39;s one from an anonymous
[4783.76s] person asking about Bath and Body Works
[4787.36s] bbwi another
[4789.32s] store that my kids like to shop at
[4795.159s] it&#39;s
[4797.04s] down I mean it&#39;s still up 5x from the
[4800.08s] covid
[4806.36s] lows I don&#39;t I generally don&#39;t like this
[4808.76s] type of business uh we&#39;ve seen it too
[4810.76s] much before they had that Bed Bath and
[4813.639s] Beyond which was a little different but
[4815.239s] then they had another one that was just
[4816.8s] like this called uh Bath and Body Works
[4820.679s] I think or not Bath and Body Works uh
[4825.04s] oh
[4826.96s] man I don&#39;t know it was one of those
[4829.04s] stores with the candles and the soap and
[4830.679s] all that stuff and it was just a
[4832.8s] fad
[4835.36s] um this looks like I don&#39;t know what
[4839.159s] this Revenue drop is they must have sold
[4840.76s] off the division their margins are
[4842.4s] declining their revenues have been flat
[4845.0s] I I don&#39;t know what&#39;s to really like
[4846.48s] here cash flow has been
[4848.4s] declining um let&#39;s see what else we got
[4852.36s] here
[4860.48s] yeah I know let&#39;s see
[4864.28s] here so revenues have flattened out and
[4867.32s] are declining
[4870.56s] earnings are declining and and the thing
[4873.88s] about it is the stock is only
[4877.239s] down
[4879.48s] 40% uh after being up 10x
[4884.8s] or call it 9x whatever um 10x at the
[4888.08s] peak
[4889.4s] 9x at the recent Peak
[4898.04s] um taken their debt down a little they
[4900.639s] they&#39;ve taken their debt down a bit but
[4902.719s] let&#39;s just see their balance sheet
[4904.48s] they&#39;ve got a billion of cash
[4915.12s] so their multiples are cheap because the
[4916.84s] business is declining I just I just
[4919.52s] don&#39;t think there&#39;s enough upside
[4921.28s] relative to the downside I mean like
[4923.76s] this is a trade that if you get it right
[4925.719s] it goes to $60 in a couple of years but
[4928.84s] like if these revenues continue to
[4930.8s] decelerate a stock like this could
[4932.199s] easily fall back to $15 so uh I don&#39;t
[4935.52s] really have any edge here so I&#39;m going
[4937.12s] to I&#39;m going to pass on
[4940.08s] that but um yeah generally don&#39;t like
[4943.8s] that type of business
[4946.76s] uh see too many fail Yankee Candle
[4948.8s] Company all that smelly candle
[4951.199s] it just it it comes and
[4953.159s] goes um Mex smelly
[4956.28s] soap you know right now Sephora like my
[4959.04s] kids spend so much money on Sephora it&#39;s
[4960.84s] crazy number one they shouldn&#39;t even be
[4962.199s] wearing makeup but you know I&#39;m
[4963.88s] outnumbered here I got three women to
[4965.52s] one they&#39;re going to do what they&#39;re
[4967.12s] going to do but
[4969.719s] um that&#39;s
[4971.679s] lvmh that&#39;s kind of interesting cuz
[4973.719s] that&#39;s been in the camp because of uh
[4976.159s] China weakness and that&#39;s another one we
[4978.28s] keep our eye on because China&#39;s going to
[4980.04s] come back and all these things are going
[4981.239s] to come back Hermes and so all again
[4984.679s] consumer discretionary all right uh this
[4986.92s] guy is asking Peter Webster&#39;s asking
[4988.76s] about Mexican TV group this is a cheap
[4991.88s] stock I think you won&#39;t get hurt with
[4993.719s] this um but it&#39;s television and it&#39;s
[5000.679s] uh it&#39;s not where money&#39;s going it&#39;s
[5003.04s] money it&#39;s where money&#39;s going away
[5005.48s] from cash flows recovering their
[5007.76s] revenues have been declining their
[5009.32s] margins have been declining I think this
[5011.719s] is a trade I don&#39;t think this is a
[5013.4s] business you want to own for a while I
[5014.92s] think it&#39;s you
[5016.52s] know I think you might get a punt back
[5019.08s] to seven or $10 if you&#39;re lucky but
[5022.32s] that&#39;s a speculation I&#39;m not I&#39;m not
[5024.0s] really interested that&#39;s a secularly
[5025.56s] declining
[5026.84s] business
[5029.08s] um Toma
[5031.96s] Fisher how do you allocate your time to
[5034.08s] students studying businesses at the
[5035.4s] micro level and follow following the
[5036.96s] market as a whole you often mention
[5039.04s] indicator sentiment seasonality
[5040.92s] character how this helps your strategy
[5042.159s] and how you divide your research time uh
[5044.84s] I don&#39;t have a framework for dividing my
[5047.52s] time because I don&#39;t think about it like
[5049.0s] an employee like oh I&#39;m going to do
[5051.52s] eight hours today you know some days I
[5053.719s] do 16 hours and some days I do six I
[5056.239s] mean but I&#39;m always thinking about all
[5058.36s] of it all the time and it creates I take
[5062.679s] in as much data as humanly POS possible
[5064.719s] I mean the amount of companies I study
[5067.159s] that I will never put a dollar into are
[5070.52s] staggering and they&#39;re on purpose
[5073.159s] because the things I hear in certain
[5074.76s] earnings calls and read in earnings
[5076.159s] calls transcripts cross over to
[5079.04s] businesses that I do hold or would hold
[5081.84s] or avoid or don&#39;t want and for
[5084.76s] particular reasons so um I do it all
[5088.04s] that&#39;s that&#39;s uh the simple answer Toma
[5090.32s] I don&#39;t think about it as fixed time I I
[5092.92s] like I do three things I do family I do
[5096.6s] work and I Golf and beyond that I don&#39;t
[5099.159s] do anything else so um there are all
[5102.56s] interrelated when I&#39;m golfing I&#39;m
[5104.0s] talking to business people and finding
[5105.4s] out about the economy when I&#39;m uh
[5108.199s] working I&#39;m uh just doing what I love
[5111.4s] it&#39;s a treasure hunt and when when I&#39;m
[5113.0s] with family I&#39;m just enjoying that so
[5115.56s] that&#39;s all I
[5116.84s] do uh and then
[5120.36s] finally uh another anonymous email about
[5124.56s] uh hello fresh uh someone asked me about
[5128.83s] [Music]
[5131.52s] um what was it grab
[5135.159s] Holdings I think which was
[5138.8s] um anyway hellofresh look this is cheap
[5142.88s] I think that business is not the
[5144.92s] business I&#39;m interested in someone asked
[5146.679s] me about um
[5156.56s] the one that has
[5162.04s] Factor uh I think this is
[5166.08s] actually rear viw mirrror not just
[5168.88s] because covid is
[5173.119s] over oh my goodness we got more
[5176.119s] questions
[5178.0s] okay but because the demographics so I
[5181.08s] you know part of the reason we own a lot
[5182.92s] of things we own is because the bulk of
[5184.4s] our population is 33 34 year old uh
[5187.239s] similar to China by the way uh and
[5189.92s] they&#39;re moving from getting these single
[5192.32s] things in the mail when they have an
[5193.639s] apartment and popping them in the
[5194.96s] microwave to going to Costco and buying
[5199.119s] you know 20 pieces of chicken for $20 to
[5201.639s] feed two or three
[5203.48s] kids uh they&#39;re in the baby creation
[5207.04s] stages and when you&#39;re in the baby
[5208.4s] creation stages you&#39;re not ordering one
[5211.48s] serving for you or two servings for you
[5213.32s] and your wife
[5215.04s] um I mean we did that for a while we got
[5217.44s] like three microwaves it was the
[5218.679s] stupidest thing ever like we did we all
[5220.239s] did a lot of stupid things during Co but
[5225.96s] um I think this is rearview mirror now
[5228.679s] you could say it&#39;s a cheap cigar butt
[5230.36s] and they&#39;re going to continue to do fine
[5232.4s] I&#39;m going to say I just don&#39;t want to be
[5233.8s] in the space at all no matter how cheap
[5236.119s] it is even though cash flow is
[5237.4s] recovering even though revenues are high
[5240.28s] and flattening even though margins are
[5242.52s] kind of holding on but declining
[5244.96s] uh I I I want nothing to do with it at
[5246.92s] any price I can&#39;t predict the future but
[5248.6s] I I don&#39;t like the business whether it&#39;s
[5250.84s] Blue Apron they so many have gone bust
[5253.08s] and you could say well you know it&#39;s
[5255.32s] just this one and the other one that has
[5257.44s] factor that the other guy sent in last
[5259.44s] week and they&#39;ll be the winners I don&#39;t
[5262.08s] think any of them are going to be
[5263.04s] winners I think people are going to go
[5264.36s] out of their house they&#39;re going to you
[5266.0s] know if they don&#39;t want to cook they&#39;re
[5267.48s] going to buy that you know go to Whole
[5268.92s] Foods and get that stuff at the buffet
[5271.639s] and uh most people don&#39;t want to go out
[5273.56s] and if they&#39;re
[5274.92s] in family formation they&#39;re going to
[5276.159s] start going to Kroger&#39;s and Albertson&#39;s
[5278.199s] and Walmart and Whole Foods and
[5282.52s] um and Costco so for me it&#39;s a pass I
[5286.96s] understand why you got there and the
[5288.36s] framework is correct I just think
[5290.44s] secularly it&#39;s it&#39;s not a it&#39;s not
[5293.239s] something I want to own I think it could
[5295.8s] work as a trade because it&#39;s so cheap on
[5297.6s] every single metric and I can see what
[5299.119s] got you interested but it&#39;s not for me
[5301.159s] Jim Jones uh what&#39;s the difference
[5302.92s] between holding not New York and Hong
[5304.4s] Kong shares of
[5307.159s] Alibaba um there&#39;s no difference uh the
[5311.44s] the only reason we own some in Hong Kong
[5314.119s] is because there was a period of time
[5316.04s] about a year ago where they were going
[5318.04s] to there was a serious possibility that
[5320.4s] they could be Del delisted from the us
[5323.04s] so we didn&#39;t want to deal with that risk
[5324.84s] and since then the pcaob gave him the
[5327.0s] green light and uh so now it really
[5329.6s] makes no difference uh so I&#39;ll be good
[5332.04s] at that John Silva
[5334.88s] would you average up your VF Corp
[5336.76s] position after seeing the Stellar
[5338.119s] execution for Brack and darl and the
[5339.719s] team so far uh I never average up
[5342.88s] anything I I never buy up I buy down if
[5346.159s] it goes against me and I expect to buy
[5347.76s] down after I initiate a position but I I
[5349.679s] would I would never buy up um
[5353.76s] vfc you it&#39;s just starting here it&#39;s up
[5356.199s] from whatever it is 12 to
[5359.56s] 17 um I think the upside is a lot higher
[5362.48s] I mean Brack and Daryl
[5364.88s] created a whatever it was a 20 20
[5367.679s] something bagger in a few years with
[5369.36s] Logitech and that&#39;s a commodity product
[5371.48s] I mean Vans and Timberland and northb
[5375.159s] and Dickies these are all kind of sexy
[5377.32s] brands that you can do a lot with I mean
[5379.8s] a a commodity video camera is nothing
[5382.08s] sexy and the guy turned the thing around
[5384.48s] and uh had a multi bagger so this thing
[5387.56s] this thing could I don&#39;t know if it&#39;ll
[5389.44s] go to new Highs but it wouldn&#39;t surprise
[5391.0s] me if it went to New highs over the next
[5392.48s] 5 years but we&#39;re certainly going to get
[5394.32s] a multibagger out of it and we&#39;ll look
[5395.88s] at the um we will look at
[5401.199s] the fundamentals when we get to our
[5404.679s] initial Target for intrinsic value based
[5407.199s] on what they&#39;re doing uh we&#39;re not going
[5409.159s] to new highs with Vans doing down 20%
[5411.44s] every quarter and uh and him getting on
[5413.92s] the phone and saying uh we&#39;re doing
[5415.96s] better we&#39;re down 20% instead of 21%
[5418.56s] like you know that dog don&#39;t hunt but
[5420.639s] that&#39;s part of the turnaround process
[5422.0s] and we&#39;re understanding of that and and
[5423.6s] based on the indicators he shared with
[5425.199s] us and some of the things that we&#39;re
[5426.719s] seeing uh we think that&#39;s going to be
[5428.8s] temporary and uh in which case uh
[5432.239s] there&#39;s a lot more upside and and the
[5433.96s] ride has just begun so uh no I&#39;m not
[5436.28s] giving you my predetermined exit for our
[5438.719s] first trunch that&#39;s to the benefit of my
[5440.76s] clients uh but um I will let you know
[5443.96s] when we&#39;re out and uh and in the
[5446.04s] meantime you shouldn&#39;t be in unless
[5447.679s] you&#39;ve done your own homework so we&#39;ll
[5449.8s] continue to update you on that we&#39;ll you
[5452.119s] know on our thinking around it they
[5454.28s] report earnings just as we did two three
[5456.04s] weeks ago but I think the upside is
[5458.159s] enormous and um and we&#39;re really betting
[5460.76s] on the horse here and that&#39;s something
[5462.08s] we love to do if you notice in our
[5463.679s] turnarounds is BET on the jockey even in
[5466.28s] the case of Advanced Auto Parts which
[5468.0s] has been a show um
[5472.52s] uh Shane o&#39; Kelly is doing everything he
[5475.88s] said he was going to
[5477.84s] do and uh we feel very good about what
[5481.199s] he&#39;s doing now could we have done
[5483.0s] without the soft guy guidance for the
[5484.4s] next two quarters of course but Disney
[5487.119s] had the same soft guidance it is what it
[5489.119s] is it&#39;s the lower-end consumer but he
[5491.56s] created the liquidity we needed to take
[5493.92s] solvency risk off the table uh and he
[5496.44s] was very successful with the world pack
[5498.36s] sale uh and now he&#39;s executing the way
[5501.679s] he did at HD Supply which was A7 billion
[5504.36s] business for Home Depot that he
[5506.719s] absolutely shot the lights out with and
[5508.8s] he&#39;s going to do the same thing with
[5509.96s] Advanced Auto Parts and turn it into a
[5511.639s] very nice very profitable business
[5514.04s] that&#39;s growing a 100 stores a year and
[5515.679s] doing it in the right way and servicing
[5518.119s] the professionals as well as the DIY
[5520.8s] Blended box Focus business no
[5523.199s] distractions and this thing will turn
[5525.0s] around and become a multibagger over
[5526.48s] time right now it&#39;s trading like death
[5528.28s] but that&#39;s what they do you know they go
[5529.8s] against you before they double and
[5531.08s] triple and it happens every single time
[5534.199s] um if it if it was easy everyone would
[5537.04s] do it simple Yes easy no and that&#39;s
[5540.159s] where our value ad is and um
[5545.119s] and and that&#39;s how it works so uh alios

[5574.48s] University of Bristol it&#39;s about an hour
[5576.719s] giving advice for anyone who wants to
[5578.52s] get into the business what they should
[5579.88s] do and how they should do
[5583.44s] it uh Jack mon monado asks Tom can you
[5587.679s] please let me know what you think of
[5588.8s] Volkswagen seems undervalue to me I
[5591.08s] would never buy an oem uh let these guys
[5594.04s] kill each other it&#39;s going to be a race
[5595.8s] to the bottom with pricing and
[5597.239s] incentives in the next two years and
[5599.32s] it&#39;s and volumes are going to go through
[5600.719s] the roof uh which is going to help
[5602.6s] Cooper standard so I I know they&#39;re
[5604.719s] cheap I&#39;m not interested whether it&#39;s
[5606.44s] Ford GM Volkswagen Toyota you can have
[5609.719s] them all I just want to supply to the I
[5612.679s] want to be the Arms Dealer and as they
[5615.199s] cut prices and increase incentives and
[5617.159s] volume goes through the roof uh we will
[5620.119s] make tons of money on more volume with
[5622.8s] huge operating leverage with Cooper
[5624.44s] standard so we&#39;re in the ceiling and
[5627.239s] fluid transfer fuel delivery uh
[5630.4s] businesses and the top and uh we just
[5633.159s] want them to sell tons of cars we don&#39;t
[5635.119s] care at what margins we think their
[5636.52s] margins are going to go down and their
[5638.48s] volumes are going to go up and our
[5640.719s] volumes are going to go up and our
[5642.199s] margins are going to go up because our
[5643.6s] operating Leverage is incredible so with
[5646.159s] that said we&#39;ll see you next week same
[5648.88s] time same place in the meantime make it
[5650.96s] a great one bye for now
