**Tom's Current Market Conviction: Bullish, favoring sectors outside the Magnificent Seven and international markets like China. → 9/10** 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥☆

- Divergence between earnings growth and S&P weighting creates opportunities.
- Global central banks are cutting rates, providing a competitive advantage to international companies.
- Small caps and healthcare offer generational opportunities.
- China is poised for a parabolic move.

## Macro Thesis & Key Data Points
The market is a weighing machine in the long term, and opportunities arise when there are big divergences between earnings growth and weighting in the S&P. Money is rotating away from big tech into unloved sectors and international markets. Global central banks are cutting rates, while the Federal Reserve is dithering, creating opportunities in international equities. Small caps and healthcare offer generational opportunities.

| Indicator | Value | Tom's Interpretation |
|-----------|-------|----------------------|
| S&P 500 Earnings Growth vs. Sector Weight | Significant divergence, with MAG7 overweighted relative to earnings. | Opportunity to rotate into undervalued sectors. |
| Central Bank Rate Cuts | 88 central bank cuts year-to-date. | Supports international equity outperformance. |
| Defensive Sector Weights | Extreme low in defensive sector weights relative to 2000 trough. | Contrarian indicator favoring consumer defensive stocks. |
| Small Cap vs. Large Cap Performance | Best opportunity since 2000. | Generational buying opportunity in small caps. |
| China Stock Rally | Shanghai benchmark at decade high. | Early stages of a bull run in Chinese stocks. |
