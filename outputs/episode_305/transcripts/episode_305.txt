Welcome to Hedge Fund Tips with Tom Hayes. I'm Tom Hayes and this is your 305th podcast video cast for the week ending August 21st, 2025. As always, we'll start with family first and then we'll get down to business. Lot of great stuff to cover this week. We'll try to keep it under uh well, I can't promise we'll keep it under an hour, but we're going to try to because next week we're going to have a tremendous amount of media. We'll be on claiming countdown on Monday. We will be on the Big Money Show for the full two hours. Uh all these are Fox Business, by the way. Uh full two hours on Tuesday. We will be on Vanney on Wednesday morning on Fox Business. Uh potentially Charles Payne on Thursday, not confirmed. Uh Yahoo Finance on Thursday afternoon at 3 p.m. And uh Yahoo Finance with Kenny Pulkari at uh 100 p.m. on Monday. and BBC on 10:30 a.m. So, we're gonna have a lot of media next week. So, this week we'll try to go easy on you. Uh this was Annabelle, her first day at uh at school uh this Monday. So, pretty excited for her. That's us having breakfast on Saturday. Caitlyn, Mimi, and Annabelle. We had a fun time and so on. So, not a whole lot to uh to go into. Uh for those of you who have been voting for Annabelle at the athlete of the year, um just remember all the votes are free. You don't have to donate anything. So it's a long process. So if if you get emails to vote and you feel like voting and you think she deserves to win, please do so. Just do the free stuff. And um and I think this thing goes for another few weeks, but every time you get a chance to vote for free, please do so. and um uh that'll be awesome for her. And then moving along onto the media, had the pleasure to join uh Ash Webster on Varnian Co. Fox Business on Friday talking a little Baba and a lot more. Thanks to Payton Jennings and Christian Dagger for having me on. We'll listen in here down even further. Look at some of these stocks. Let's begin with United Health and Newore both heading higher this morning as you can see nicely. Berkshire Hathaway disclosed major investments into both companies while pairing Apple stock. So there you go. Look at United Health up 10%. Uh Thomas Hayes is with me this morning to talk about this. Uh good morning to you Thomas. Do you follow Warren Buffett and Burkshire Haway moves? I mean certainly the market seems to >> very very closely. My whole business is predicated on the philosophy that what Warren Buffett once said, great investment opportunities come around when excellent companies are surrounded by unusual circumstances that cause the stock price to be misappraised. United Healthcare is the perfect example of that. This is one of the greatest healthcare insurance companies in history. The stock was down 61% peak to trough this year on the DOJ investigation into Medicare billing. uh and increased loss ratio. He swooped in and bought it in the hole while everyone was puking out the stock in uncertainty. Warren Buffett and his team bought it. That's what's made him the greatest of all time and will continue to make him the greatest of all time. Uh as it relates to new core, Buffett historically likes competition. Uh businesses that have no competition and with 50% steel tariffs and the massive reshoring happening in the United States, New Cor is well positioned due to that. And uh Warren Buffett said, "I'd like some of that." >> All right. Well, let's move on. I want to talk about Intel. A lot been talked about this uh chip maker. Another good day for the let's call it the bewildered chipmaker. It's up 2 and a.5% after yesterday's 7% gain. A new report says the Trump administration is considering taking a stake in the company. Uh which in itself is fascinating. Intel is one of your stock picks. Why do you like Intel that has been struggling? >> We love it. We gave it to Stu at $20. It's sat there forever. It's now starting to go. If if the uh government actually steps in, like a wartime policy, a competitive policy, the Ohio chip plant for fabs could be one of the largest chipmaking plants in the world. And you know why we bought it? It's the only game in town. If you're serious about building chips in the United States, they're at the 10 yard line. They do need some government help to push it over the edge. But Lip Bhutan who came from Cadence Systems is a winner. He did a turnaround at Cadence. The stock was down 85%. 68 Bagger over the next 14 years. This guy knows how to turn around companies. He went to meet with President Trump if they're investing side by side with Lip Bhutan. They're going to have a huge win for Intel, huge win for the United States and make us less dependent. And by the way, there was an announcement that he's considering tariffs, 300% tariffs on chips coming in. How's that going to set up Intel moving forward? It's going to be a monopoly for Intel if they get this done correctly. >> Very good. All right, let's move on to another well-known name, Meta. A new report from Reuters is calling out the company over their AI chat bots. They say uh internal documents show that Meta allowed their chat bots to engage in romantic conversations with children. Are you kidding me? Republican senators Holly and Blackburn are now calling for a congressional probe over that uh accusation. This is a weird one. Meta itself up half a percent. What's your take on all of that? >> I think Meta has got to get on it. We're going to see all kinds of unintended consequences from AI, but also all kinds of unintended benefits from AI. But the consequences and the negatives, you can't have inappropriate talk with minors. That needs to be nipped in the bud very, very quickly. It's good to see the senators taking action right away to get ahead of it. You know, with social, maybe they were a little behind the curve. With AI, hopefully they can stay ahead of the curve. This is a good development. It will be good for Meta. It will be good for the kids. It'll be good for creating a framework for this new technology. >> Exactly. All right. Uh moving on to the semiconductor equipment maker, Applied Materials down 12 nearly 13% after their third quarter earnings. Their forecast for the current quarter came in a little lighter than expected and CEO Gary Dickerson says that the macro environment is quote creating increased uncertainty and lower visibility. Uh you know what do you make of that? Any worry for these stocks? >> Well, he did the absolute no no, which is he took down guidance. The average company that beat beat and raised this quarter was up four four and a half%. The average company that took down guidance was down over 10%. Applied materials is no different. They were complaining about tariffs. They were complaining about export licenses. News flash, everyone else in your in your sector has the same problems and they're doing just fine. So, get your act together. >> All right. Tough love. Uh let's take a look at Target. Uh headed south, down ever so slightly, nearly half a percent after a downgrade from Bank of America. Uh, analysts say the retailer is falling behind its peers, namely Amazon and Walmart. They say Target's outlook is quote deteriorating, which is not good. So, can Target catch up to Walmart and Amazon. What's your take on this, or is it too late? >> Look, the sell side is famous for downgrading in the hole. This stock is down a lot off of its all-time highs. I think this is an area where you want to start to look at it's a high quality business. Uh, my 11year-old and 13year-old daughters can't get enough of Target. They love it. They say they have everything they need all the time. Even I've gone to the store and I said, "This is pretty cool." So, look, at these levels, I want to start to take a look at this. This is a high quality, durable business that's proved its way over time. Uh, and they'll get it right. Whether it goes a little lower before it starts to recover uh is unknown, but I think for the long term, you probably start to be okay at these levels. >> I want to get to another of your stock picks. Uh Tom, uh we had one another analyst earlier this week bring us the same stock. There has to be something to it. Albamo. >> Okay. Well, Ash, I brought this to Stew on June 18th. >> It's up close to 50%. >> So, so the and by the way, it's going to double again from here over the next few years in our opinion. Here's why. The Chinese government is taking out over capacity. They did not renew a license for CL uh to continue its lithium mining. So they're starting to take supply off the market. Albamaro is one of the lowest cost producers uh in the world. They there's uh cyclally positioned perfectly. They've got $3.1 billion of liquidity and demand for lithium is going from 1.2 million metric tonses to 3.2 million by 2030. And that's not just Chinese EVs. That's energy battery storage systems. They are the players. They're going to be benefit. >> We hear you. You're very optimistic. Thank you. Great stuff, Thomas Hayes, today. Thank you very much. Uh, coming up, a whistlebl >> and we're back. Then I want to thank uh Johan Cherion and Saiita Roy for having me in their Reuters article. Um, and then quote of the week from the great greatest of all time, Warren Buffett, the stock market is a device for transferring money from the impatient to the patient. No better example this week than Cooper Standard that were transferring us all of their shares in uh 2022 at $5 and then we got some more at $3 and change and we got some more at seven and got that initial basis around $5 and uh now it just got upgraded for the first time by Stiffel uh with a buy rating uh price target $39. $9. So, here we are 500 uh 5x later and uh almost 6xx probably by the end of the week and just getting started. So, but who you know nowadays who could be in a stock for three years uh to get 500% gains and the answer is very few people and the the problem is you don't get 500% gains uh without patience. So we just learn from the master and we try to uh communicate those philosophies and framework with you each week. And for those of you who um are avid listeners, the way we continue to do this uh in perpetuity is by sharing and growing. If we continue to grow, we're going to continue to to do this and come here and leave it all on the field every single week. And one of the ways we do it is we have merch uh with the merch store. And it's not for the seven or eight bucks we make on a hat. It's so that you wear it and people ask you about the incredible hat and what's that all about. So do the best compliment you could always pay us. Certainly wear your merch. Uh uh and secondly is share the podcast with one person each week that you care about that loves markets that you think could could benefit. And this week we had a bunch of people send in their pictures. We got way more people that have ordered merchandise than have sent in pictures. uh send it to info@hedgefundtips.com. We'll get you on the site and uh you can see some of your uh community members here that had the courage to uh send in a picture. Get on the site. Uh this week, Kathleen Gerkin sent in a picture. So, super excited. It just goes on and on and on. There's Statman uh my buddy that teaches over at Westminster and uh his great students. So, moving along, we got um uh the data. Let's get down to some data here. And first and foremost, it's interesting. Earnings weight versus sector weight over time. And this is just another way to think about what we always say. In the short term, the market's a voting machine based on emotion. Long-term, it's a weighing machine based on fundamentals. And you can see here they've got health care plus u consumer staples plus utilities. These are defensives. And you can see that by and large the waiting of the sector follows the earnings growth over time. And when there are big divergences between earnings growth and waiting in the S&P, what you find is opportunity. And right now what we're seeing is a big divergence because short-term voting long-term weighing eventually converges is the point that I'm making. Uh right now the biggest divergence is in MAG7 has such a disproportionate percentage of the waiting in the S&P relative to the percentage of net income of the S&P i.e. earnings power. And we're seeing signs of that start to come back in and normalize this week as people are puking again out of some of the mag 7 etc and into unmag 493 and others that we've been talking about. Now that in mind which we cover each week you know this time of the year has a tendency to be a little choppy. that's going to be mostly reflected in the um S&P which is basically a MAG7 ETF nowadays uh given the waiting. So those names will continue to see chop and I do think we're going to see the names like Baxter is moving some of the defensive Dagio Estee Lauder they're all starting to move uh because they do great in periods like this. So, uh, so that's what we're we're focused on in position for. Southbound buying hits record in Hong Kong, so people are now panic buying into China. That game hasn't even begun. We're super excited about that. [Music] Um, by the end of the week, 90% of corporates will be out of their blackout window, which means um they can be in the market buying stock. August is the busiest month for repurchases. S&P 500 year-over-year earnings growth, you can see here in Q3 and Q4, drops off and then reacelerates in 2026. So, we'll keep an eye on that. Retail sales continue to be strong. the consumer confidence. They continue to tell you that they're depressed and they want to jump off a bridge, but on the way to the bridge, they stop off at Home Depot and Walmart and uh uh all these other places and bye-bye. So, uh watch what they do, not what they say. 88 central bank cuts year-to date, fastest cut cycle since 2020. So while uh Powell uh is um dithering and uh doing what he does, the rest of the world is cutting and that's why the uh rest of the world equity outperformance has been uh over a thousand basis points over the US because they're all lowering rates, increasing margins for their companies, giving them a competitive advantage, the global central banks, while Powell continues to keep his foot on the brake even though we're in fifth gear. uh and um put us at a competitive disadvantage. So uh this next lady will be kicked out uh uh most likely which will create a fourth dissenting voice on the board of governors which will be the all-time high in disscent against the uh acting Fed share i.e. lame duck orama. Next, it better be different this time. Price to book uh value ratio, you can see in 2000 it was at five times. Now it's at 5.3 times. This is an extreme. Now, you know, you're going to get the wise guys that are going to say, well, you know, uh uh book value is not an accurate measure because all these businesses are asset light now. And there's some truth to that. But look, when you get to uh you know, three standard deviations above the mean, you account for all that. It's it's crazy town and we're seeing the signs of the uh reckoning and uh the resolution of that and we're positioned for it. Percentage chance of a September cut still high 80 80 some five some percent. Uh new single family homes for sale. Uh supply is coming online. We're going to see more and we're seeing that start to pressure. That's kind of in line with what our thesis has been. foreign holders of US treasuries starting to reacelerate levered long versus inverse ETF assets under management. Uh so you are seeing some again overconentration overexuberance toward those seven stocks and just as they're starting to get distributed uh cyclicals versus defensive performance best since great financial crisis. So, we're starting to see that huge acceleration. That's why we're seeing it in the P&L and uh performance. So, again, position for that. This chart keeps us up at night. This is from Strategus. It says the sum of S&P 500 defensive sector weights uh consumer. So you're seeing a an extreme of defensives waitings being uh below the 2000 trough in 21.6. So just to put it in context, what does it mean? It means in 2000 there was a cover of uh I think it was Forbes Buffett on the cover has has Buffett lost his touch because everyone was bidding up the palunteers of the day i.e. Cisco and other companies uh Amazon all of which lost 90% of their value over the next 36 months despite improving fundamentals of the business particularly in the case of Amazon. Uh, so they weren't bad businesses. They were just overpriced. They were pricing everything that could go right for the next 20 years was already priced in like we're seeing with some of the other stocks that are part of those weights. And um, so Buffett was buying, you know, consumer defensive stocks, Staples, you know, Coca-Cola, uh, boring businesses like like of that ilk. And, uh, over the next three years while the N The S&P was down 50%, NASDAQ was down again because it was all weighted in the high-flying stocks. NASDAQ was down, you know, 80 90%. Buffett had among his best three years ever. I think it was up like 50% a year. Um, so this this rubber band is stretched. We will benefit from the um reversion to the mean. Um, and in the meantime, what's so great is we're buying with such a margin of safety, even though the tailwinds of equal weight versus cap weight haven't fully uh slingshoted yet, the names we're in on a discrete basis are doing well because they're just such great bargains with such improving fundamentals that even X the tailwinds that are coming like a tidal wave in coming I'll say years but I think it's much sooner uh months um the simple message I'm saying is if you think it's exciting what's what's been happening year to date wait till you see when we actually get uh what Charlie Mer calls the la palooa and we ride the wave on top of it and then everyone panics into our point of view. Um it's it's exciting time. So anyway, US M&A transaction fees see uptick. We've talked about this animal spirits S&P has outperformed equal weight since 2015. We saw this in the late 90s and then it was a complete fall off the cliff after that same theme. Industry average transaction price versus industry average incentive as a percentage of average total price. So total prices have stopped going up. Incentives have started to reacelerate. That's all good for Cooper Standard and that's why you're seeing the steifles of the world get on the train and kudos to Stiffl. Um, better late than never, sure, but at the same time they're going to be early in terms of the sell side. You're going to see more and more sellside people jump on at 50. Uh, more jump on at 80 and then they'll all be on board after 100 in our opinion. Again, all this opinion, not advice. When you go to buy your hat and shirt and uh all that stuff, go to termsedgeips.com. This is all opinion, not advice. Talk to uh your psychic, your financial advisor, your your spiritual guru before you do anything at all. China stock rally has the makings of adorable bull run. You think just getting started, ladies and gentlemen. Mainland Chinese investors buy record amount of Hong Kong stocks. That was part of our thesis. This this hasn't even begun. Trump will do a deal. They'll shake hands. Uh Baba's earnings are coming out I think tomorrow, which is exciting. Uh and so on. So th this is early days. China stock rally send Shanghai benchmarked decade high. Um it's mindboggling to see the amount of what we're able to do before before even Alibaba starts to go. I mean I Yes, it's double up off the bottom. Yes, we brought the basis down to the low 80s. Yes, all that's great, but like relative to where it's going, it it hasn't begun. Funds with $600 billion turned less bearish on China survey shows. Again, opinion follows trend, ladies and gentlemen. China steps up tax crackdown on overseas investment. Wealthy individuals are rethinking trading strategy as Beijing tries to fill its coffers. So, in other words, they're saying uh that money is not going abroad, it's going into China companies. How you doing, Alibaba? Why 2025 is the year to invest in international stocks? You know, that was our pound the table in Q4 of 2024. They're a little late to the message, but early to the theme. So, um, and they just do it quantifiably here. That's not a word. Oh, that's not by Susan Dinsky. She's probably the best person at Morgan Stanley at, uh, Morning Star, by the way. No investment strategy works forever, not even for the Mag Seven. So they're talking about the unwind of that trade. Some data behind it over at Barren. Jacob son and shine over there. Money's rotating away from big tech. That's a good sign. Agreed. It shows sign of healthy market. Uh and Brad Jacobs, here we go. A bet on QXO stock is a bet on this billionaire. Why? It's time to buy. Early days in this story as well. Uh super excited to meet with him in late September. Um and we love this housing theme. We love this guy's made more money for shareholders than any other CEO uh in history I think uh on a repeated basis. Uh absolutely excited for uh early days in QXO and the housing recovery. Okay. Somehow I skipped out of data. So all right and got into articles. So uh S&P firms enjoy best season in about four years with the earning share of firms beating earnings estimates is the highest since Q3 2021. Foreigners start to return US existing home purchases by foreign buyers is ticking back up. That's a function of the dollar. If you for those of you who were in New York in like 2004 to 2007 like the the housing market in New York was booming. And the reason was is the the euro at that point was at like 165 or uh yeah got up to 165. So all of this European money was coming in buying US real estate. That's also going to be a tailwind for housing as we see more and more like while it will appear expensive to American buyers uh foreign buyers as the euro the CAD or the looney and other currencies appreciate against the US dollar you're going to start to see that foreign money start to flock in to uh US real estate. Uh European small caps have lagged euro strength. So this again short-term voting machine, long-term weighing machine, it will catch up. Small caps are normally cheap. This is now US going all the way back to 2009. Huge time to buy. Uh this oh this is European. Okay. European small caps relative PE to larger peers. So same story in the US. Here's S&P 500 equal weight versus S&P which is basically MAG 7 to UNMAG 493. And you can see there hasn't been an opportunity like this since the great financial crisis lows. uh which is exciting. Small caps starting to break out here. This is what they call like a cup and handle type of thing. Uh small caps versus large caps. Best opportunity since 2000. Look, you here here's what's here's what's really exciting about this and I can't I continue to reemphasize when I say generational opportunities. I'm not being hyperbolic. Okay? If you're a 48year-old hedge fund manager or investment manager, okay, you are not going to get a better opportunity to buy small caps than you have right now for another 20 years most likely. We have not 25 years. We have not seen this type of opportunity to buy small caps relative to large caps since the early 2000s. Okay, that's generational. The next time I will have this type of opportunity to get rich in small caps or let's let's be honest richer uh because of small caps uh is going to probably be 20 25 years from now. So, you know, I'll be 75 by then. Hopefully, I'll be a three handicap. And uh my guess is probably working just as hard as I do now because doers do. That's the bottom line. I I see it over and over. it just doers do they like they think they're going to retire and then they don't and you know it's they just like winning they like playing the game to the best of their ability and it's not about money it's about quality work it's about fulfillment it's about you know I had a mentor in my 20s named Jim Ran and um he had a saying that he said if you don't produce you won't be happy period okay you can buy the jets you can buy the boats you can buy the houses you can buy all that stuff. All that means is you just have to hire more people to take care of it. It's not going to make you happy. What's going to make you happy is production. And and and production is adding value to other people. You don't get you don't get abnormal compensation if you don't provide abnormal value. That's the way it goes. And and it's very hard not to be fulfilled if you're providing abnormally good value to other people. And that's probably my best message for all the young people that are like, "How do I make the most money in the shortest amount of time and all that bull your question is wrong. How do I provide the most amount of value uh in a you know reasonable amount of time and the money will take care of itself?" Okay. So, this just print this little chart out, get it tattooed on your back, and uh cash in. Okay? Put it on your refrigerator. And we don't do tattoos in my house. So, you know, cut it out, post it on your refrigerator with a magnet next to the uh test scores. All right. Here's Baba's share count, ladies and gentlemen. Uh what's happened? It's absolutely collapsed. That's a good thing. Why? Because you now own give or take 20% more of the company today uh than you would have, you know, two years ago with no additional money out of pocket. Okay. Small cap versus large cap. We may have seen peak negative negativity for small caps. You think prime book versus uh US long short ratio getting a little they're starting to chase up. And what are they chasing up? They're basically chasing a mag seven index. And maybe they don't know it, maybe they do know it, but that's fundamentally what they're doing. Whether they know it or they don't know it, Dumbo. Okay. The Hill Companies have invested billions into AI. 95% getting zero return. That's all you need to know about the Mag 7 trade. It is pricing in everything going right for the next 20 years. And you know what's going to happen? Everything that they promise is going to happen is going to happen and probably more. AI is probably going to be better than we think it's going to be if it doesn't kill us first. But let's just assume we're going to live and uh in which case it's going to be better than any of us could imagine. The problem is that's already priced in, ladies and gentlemen. And with some of the companies, it's more than priced in. So when they do 1% less than uh expectations, they don't fall 1%, they fall 75%. And uh I'm not predicting that because I think some of them I think they're a lot of them just need to really consolidate the gains for a while. Uh but some will some will and um and that's it. When you have expenses going up and returns on those ex or capex going up dramatically and returns on capex declining precipitously like we talk about earnings growth of the mag 7 down from 33. This quarter is going to be the first quarter where it's going to be somewhere at or below 10%. Down from 33% just a year ago and the multiples haven't yet contracted. Like come on ladies and gentlemen, do the math. Short-term voting machine, long-term weighing machine, reversion to the mean. This is not rocket science. I mean, I look at, you know, some of my kids math stuff like they were doing this factor absolute stuff. Like I like little embarrassing. I forgot some of it. I mean, it's like 13, you know? I could do, you know, you can give me like 60 numbers and add, you know, multiply, divide. I could do it all in my head in two seconds. But like, anyway, we're looking for a tutor. Let's just leave it at that. Uh, Metapree is AI hiring. Uh, and they actually started firing people in their AI group. Tells you everything you need to know. Um, Meta Platforms pause hiring AI division after bringing on more than 50 researchers and engineers. Wall Street Journal report on Wednesday. percentage of S&P companies with positive three-month percentage changes in forward earnings going up. Revisions are going up, ladies and gentlemen. That's partially why the market is holding up. Consensus forward PE valuation. You can see here relative to 10 and 30-year history, absolute PE, what looks cheap, real estate, which is going to be a rate play. Financials, uh, not not in that group. So, real estate, healthcare, energy, energy, we continue to like and own uh com stock resources obviously for much lower levels. People are getting faked out because, you know, you get the short-term noise about supply and demand around natural gas. This is a secular play. If you need to make money in the next six months, I have no effing idea where comtock resources is going to be. In three years, it's going to be a lot higher. So, uh, for those of you are in the six-month game, wrong podcast, go find some guy with moving 30 minute charts that, uh, you know, has a big run for 6 months and then his channel disappears because, uh, you know, he's applying for jobs at Walmart. So, uh, healthc care, uh, same story. healthcare. I mean, other than pounding the table on China and small caps and value, I think healthc care is probably the biggest t uh um table pounder. Um we have basket of biotech and we have Baxter, which is a pretty solid amount for an 8 to12 stock portfolio. Um, but we're open-minded to have more, but we got to have enough room for our small caps like our comm stocks and our Cooper standards and our, you know, goosees and uh, stuff like that. All right, MSCI valu, how you doing, VF Corp? We love you. All right. uh MSCI China valuation multiple again trading around 10 times 11 times relative to the uh US and earnings growth accelerating versus the US. It's a no-brainer. Uh, equal weight versus. So, I I I continue to try to find it's kind of like Jesus with his parables. You know, he kept saying the same message. He just used different stories hoping that it would hit people in different ways so they'd understand the lesson. And that's what I'm trying to do with these pictures and these stories is keep saying the same thing in a different way so it hits and you and you internalize it and you go on and make a fortune and maybe you throw a few bones to great capital so we can accelerate it a little more quickly for you. Um healthcare seasonal patterns tends to be weak this time of year accelerates into year end. That's a good thing. uh M&A ticking up animal spirits equities premium valuations leave little room for error and that's when you talk about tech when you talk about equal weighted it's really really inexpensive when you look all the way down the spectrum to euro emerging markets China and hang the opportunities of the century right here paga attention as my daughter would say after listening to Dolingo for those of you who are asking about that stock they make them do it's kind of funny they make them do Dolingo know, in Spanish class, it's like, well, then why am I sending them to school? They could they were doing Dolingo when they were homeschooling. Um, anyway, Wall Street forecast revert back from tariff turmoil. Um, so opinion follows trends are all taking up their price targets. US real GDP, you can see the trends going to be a little weaker in Q3. Uh, 1% real GDP and a Fed that's belligerent makes no sense. uh monthly insider selling picking up. You know, this is interesting. You got your winners like Brad Jacobs buying GXO at $33 uh handover fist and Baba who was buying stock handover fist in the 60s7s and 80s. And then you got uh the other companies, the high-flying tech companies buying at all-time record valuations. And you can see the insiders selling into that liquidity that they're creating with you being the bag holder. Pagar attention, ladies and gentlemen. Uh unemployment rate ticking up. This is for um I think this is for the young kids if I'm not mistaken. NFIB single most important problem percent reporting poor sales. I don't know what I can tell you is this chart looks like another chart I saw which shows unemployment among young people actually you know eight or 10% the kids getting out of college not good uh Powell needs to pagar attion China stocks close at highest level since 2015 early days this is just going to start breaking out uh for all of those folks that love breakouts welcome to the party after we're up double. Uh you guys can uh join the party for another double. Uh Neil Sethy, Fed funds to 10-year yield spread remain slightly negative this week, continuing to call for at least 1% one full percentage in rate cuts with it well under the typical spread about 1 to 1.25. Visa spending momentum index way up. Watch what they do, not what they say. Stocks versus bonds. Jackson Hole move 2% on average. So, look, I'm not expecting miracles from this guy tomorrow. He tends to be a wet blanket. I think he'll he's not going to be dovish until the day after he cuts. I mean, that's really what it comes down to. He'll be hawkish until he isn't. And my guess is September's a go. If we get bad labor numbers, it's 50 bips. Uh, more likely it's going to be 25 bips. And, uh, we'll lame duck them till the end of May. I can't I've never, you know, I just can't imagine being in a job where everyone's trying to push you out and you're staying and, you know, being ineffectual and still wanting to stay for the free coffee. I mean, here's an accomplished, amazing business person, uh, who's just in the wrong job. I mean, he would have been probably a worldclass Treasury Secretary negotiating deals and running the Treasury and doing great things. just, you know, he just got the wrong position. Um, money market fund assets, we covered this. They will come down as rates come down. Cyclicals versus defensive breaking out. Um, earnings revisions going up, Russell outperforming the S&P in the last three months and the last one month and the last six months and the last 12. Is this correct? Oh, okay. Three months, six months. Yeah. So, it's the trend is changing. Uh, S&P top 10 weights is 40%. The net income I think is 24%. So again, huge divergence that will correct. Home prices fell in a record 39 major US metros in July. Pagara, Tennessee, ladies and gentlemen. Um, Magnificent 7. Okay, this is the most important chart that I've been talking about. um Magnificent Seven Stocks S&P index weight versus the share of S&P 500 net income as of August 15th, 2025. So 32% of the index weight and only 26% of the net income or the earnings power of the S&P 500. So earnings growth decelerating multiple still uh um elevated and um one of two things h has to happen either earnings growth has to reacelerate rapid or uh the multiple will start to contract and I think it's the latter for those stocks. China Internet ETF. That's Kweb. My friend Brendan Ahern runs just beginning the breakout. We are at um if you remember the uh Mammoth cycle, stock market cycle. Big reminder here. I had a new client come in uh at the um normal the $5 million level today. They can come in mid quarter. And he was telling me how he ran successful businesses in China. And he said, um he said, "I know China's moved a lot from your basis. Um, but uh I you know I I I really think it's just getting started uh based on you know my contacts over there and everything else and uh you know I know you don't don't like to buy things up but I'd really like a a heavy weight in Baba if that's possible. I was like let me tell you something. New money coming in today will have a very very heavy weight in Baba. There is no th this had this has not even started. It it has not even like we're not even it's it's just percolating ready. The ball is under the water ready to explode. Why? We are right here ladies and gentlemen. We are in this denial phase. What does this look like? Okay, let me show show me what this looks like. What the hell does this look like, ladies and gentlemen? Does this look anything like this? And if you're listening, I'm grateful, but I'm sorry for you because you're missing out from these images that will program into your brain. So, you'll see these patterns throughout the future. This is critical. We are right here. We're in this last phase of denial. We We've already gotten through the hell of a reversion. We're in this last phase of denial and we are ready to go parabolic. Okay. And um that's all I have to say. K Webb versus S&P just breaking out over this trend, the ratio chart. So good work on that. Here is healthcare relative to the S&P again going back to 2000. This is a home run generational non-hyperbolic statement. I will have to wait 25 years to have this type of opportunity again in small caps andor healthcare. and and by then I'll probably still be working this this hard so I'll take advantage of it again but all right uh stock market around breath thrust uh here we are you can see it happening we talked about that when we were here you guys have seen it uh guidance F1 guidance fiscal year guidance relative to previous guide is up penalties for missing the market's best days are stiff Um, this is 2009 to 2025. If you sold in the hole, so if you if you stuck with it, you compounded at, you know, mid- teens. If you sold in the hole and then bought back, you compounded at low single digits. And if you bought in the hole, uh, you comp, you know, you compounded at probably double what the S&P did, if not more. EV retail registration shares. So, you can see Tesla's declining. Um, I just bought my wife a new Tesla. Um, we'll see. I mean, I'm not an EV guy, but like, you know, she likes all that stuff, so whatever. Uh, new houses are now cheaper than existing homes. Uh that's pretty interesting. So you're seeing incentives there, which is volumes, which helps home builders, which is the same thing we're going to see in Cooper Standard. Ratio of market value of the five business biggest stocks to all small stocks combined. Again, extreme generational extreme generational opportunity, cumulative change. Yeah. And by the way, if you think you're going to get a generational opportunity that happens once every 20, 25 years and you're going to pin it down to the 3-day inflection point, you're a Okay? These things take time to play out and when they do, uh, it's abrupt. So, if you get the perfect bottom, you know, congratulations. You're lucky. You flipped a coin and won. If you get close to the bottom and you add over time over, you know, a 12-month period and then when it goes, it goes for multi multi multi-year, you make absolute generational fortunes. Okay. Uh, US housing starts rise to five month high. Game is on for builders, ladies and gentlemen. Gener, Stanley's, QXO's, etc. CTA positioning in US equities getting a little stretched. Those are those mag seven stocks. All right, so can I communicate this message any clearer, ladies and gentlemen? Uh here we go. What do we got here? Okay, small capsule rally into Labor Day week and then finished the year super strong. Uh that's from um uh Hirsh over at stock trader Almanac. Cap weight's breaking out. Equal weight just knocking up. They're going to break out. This is rear view mirror where the puck has been. This is windshield where the puck is going. healthcare, energy, consumer discretionary. There's your opportunity. This is where everyone's crowding in. What's already happened? This is where you want to be going, where the puck is going. Flows by ETF category. Okay. Russell 2000 non-commercial futures position. Okay. Commercials are always right. Large traders always, i.e. Hedge funds are always wrong. Here's where they are. Record short. Just like they were in the hole at the lows in 2022. Just like they were at the lows in 2019 and 2018. And they missed it. And they'll miss it again. But you won't because you are awesome, brilliant listeners of hedge fund tips with Tom Hayes. Large cap pharma stock valuations. Again, that's opportunity in healthcare. Renter households surge by 1.6 6 million in 2023. So, everyone's saying this is now the new normal. I would say lower rates and let's find out. And uh and I think that's what you're going to see. Wait till you see the interestonly 5-year ARM game back on and the seven-year ARM like you you all forgot about that. And that's when it that's when it comes back. The minute that people people have a short memory, the game is going to be on again and people are going to say, "What happened?" And um that's that strong expectations embedded in small cap. So here is earnings growth expectations for the S&P the next 12 months is like 12%. Russell at 45% and one is trading at 16 times. One's trading at 22 times. Um you can't make it up. Benefit from those divergences long as retail weekly option buying streak on record. They're buying all the high-f flyers right before the the rug gets pulled. Um, don't do that. Okay. Initial jobless claims. Powell needs to pay attention to that. That's starting to skyrocket up. Long waits between cuts can be quite bullish. Year later, 12.9. That's from Carson. And that's the data. Okay. So now we did that, did that, did that, did that, that, did that, did that. US housing starts rise to five month high led by multifamily. Okay. Building supplies. Mortgage rates slipped to lowest level of 2025. Bessant bets on stable coins to boo bolster demand for treasuries. Been talking about that for six months. Foreign holdings of treasuries climb to record high in June. The exact opposite of what people were prognosticating. Soft Bank invests $2 billion in Intel as US considers taking 10% stake in Shipmaker. Okay. So, what he said when he did it was something to the effect of Intel is going to be a major player in advanced chip manufacturing. This is uh Masayoshi's son who likes taking cowboy bets on new trends. He was an early investor in Alibaba. And what did he say here? I guess the quote's not in here, but you can find the quote. So, that's one thing that happened. The second thing that happened was US government going to take a stake. What they're doing is converting the committed grants that have not been received into equity. Uh, which is fine. I'd rather have the US government dilute me by 10% and be a committed partner, forcing all the US chip designers to start to buy from Intel once they have proven their technology and push them along to guarantee that their technology gets along the finish line with special loans, forcing people to become that big customer, that lip ban. So, this is an absolute home run. I pray it goes a little lower so I can get new clients a big position in this. Uh, and then having the government as a partner, look, this is not this is not, you know, I said to a a client who was having some concerns about some of the policy, I said, listen, we play the hand that we're dealt, not the hand that we want. And if we can if we lose the ideology about what should be and deal with what is, we can outperform by maximizing that. And that's all we do here. This is this is about making money. This is not about being right about politics. We could care less about politics. We are in the money making business. Okay? Period. I don't care if we have a Democrat. I don't care if we have a Republican. I don't care if we have a uh America first. whatever the hell it's going to be, I just want to know the priorities and then I can adjust accordingly. And that's what we've been able to do and do exceptionally well and are going to continue to do. So if the government is going to stand up Intel, I don't want to stand in their way because I know what government standing up in industry can do and I know what it did on the other side for Elon Musk would not exist if not for all hundreds of billions of dollars of government subsidies and tax credits that he was able to sell for cash over a decade plus that uh stood up an industry that would be unsustainable on a standalone basis and now is is starting to sustain itself. So, uh the same will be the case with the Intel Fab business and they're a monopoly because they're at the 10 yard line. No one else is even close. They have the history. So, they got a little sideways, but they're the only game in town. That's been our thesis since day one. And now you're seeing it happen tomorrow's newspaper today and and people are surprised, but it's not surprising. There was not another choice. So um you know it's like when you take multiple choice tests you know just eliminate the possibilities that can't be the answer and you're left with the the one thing that is correct that is the answer and that will be the case with Intel.

Uh, crafting a comeback stock market and sentiment results. We got Advance Auto Parts and Etsy. So, Advance is obviously up about double off its April bottom. Just getting started. Let's take a look at what's happening here with you can go through all this on your own, but let's get to the key stuff, which is the 10 key points. Where are the 10 key points? Hidden in the thousand key points. Here they are. Number one, Advanced Auto Parts delivered 2.01 01 billion in revenues during the quarter, landing at the high end of prior guidance and beating consensus by 33 million. Most importantly, this was driven by positive comp sales of 1/10enth of 1%, an improvement from a negative 6/10 of 1% in Q1 and also at the high end of guidance. Adjusted EPS came in well ahead of expectations at 69 cents versus the streets 54 cents. Two, management continues to deliver on the profitability front, returning the business to overall profitability in the quarter with adjusted gross margins rising to 43.8% up 16 basis points year-on-year. The most important metric in the turnaround adjusted operating margins expanded to 3% up 19 basis points year-over-year. For the full year, management continues to expect adjusted operating margins between two to 3% with the company on track to reach its 7% target by fiscal year 2027. Not 2037, 2027. Okay, implying 630 million in EBIT. Okay, this is the most important sentence of the week. For the full year, management continues to expect adjusted operating margins between 2 to 3% with the company on track to reach its 7% operating margin target by fiscal year 2027, implying 630 million in EBIT. For context, the last three times Advanced Auto Parts generated operating income in the $600 million range were 2018 when they did 617 million, 2019 when they did 679 million, and 2022 when they did 670 million. In those years when the share count was higher than it is today, earnings per share came in at 575,687 and 770 with the stock trading as high as $186, $182.60 and $24450. The stock right now, ladies and gentlemen, is like $60. Okay, the upside is enormous on this. The market still doesn't buy this and continues to treat Advanced Auto Parts as a show me story with Consensus only pricing in 4.75% operating margins for 2027. That ignores the proven winner that is CEO Shane Oke Kelly whose track record at HD Supply speaks for itself. We will side with Okelly all day long and believe the market will eventually be forced to catch up. Number three, the pro business. The pro business uh the biggest business overall driver they have got pro for professional guys who fix cars and the DIY for the schmos who change the battery in the parking lot or you know whatever the people who know how to do that. My dad was one of those guys who would sit in the driveway on the weekends and change his brakes and change his oil and change his battery and you know kudos if you have the skills to do that. uh you know I can't even you know put on whatever. All right. Uh the biggest overall driver of AAP's underlying performance continues to show strength with positive comp growth in the low single digits during the quarter and mids singledigit growth on a two-year basis. Pro customers are showing increased confidence in AAP as evidenced by sustained sales growth from both Main Street Pro accounts and large national customers. Number four, while still early in turning around the DIY side of the business, management remains encouraged by emerging signs of stabilization in the segment with Q2 DIY comp sales stable compared to Q1 and on a 2-year basis showing improvement. Management has not yet seen any significant shifts in consumer spending as the quarter ended on a strong note with DIY delivering positive results that beat momentum carrying that momentum carrying into the first four and that momentum carrying into the first four weeks of Q3. Five, the supply chain transformation continues to run ahead of schedule. Management has already closed or converted nine distribution centers this year and remains on track to finish with 16 down from the inefficiently run 38 prior to the program start. The other key driver of the transformation is Market Hubs, which stock 75,000 to 85,000 SKUs and provide same day parts availability for up to 90 stores. Management is on track to open 10 hubs this year and reach 60 by mid 2027. Most importantly, stores served by the new hub strategy continue to see an average comp sales uplift of 100 basis points, which management believes has the potential to drive even stronger sales growth over the long run. Six, management continues to work on tariff mitigation strategies while prioritizing profit dollar expansion with 40% of COGS exposed to tariffs at a blended rate of 30%. Most importantly, more than 90% of AAP's business remains nondiscretionary, keeping the company well positioned to navigate a high higher product cost environment. Seven, management is making great progress on the merchandising front, completing twothirds of the product line reviews and expecting to finish over the next few months, which should deliver 50 basis points of annualized cost reductions beginning in the second half. This process has also enabled AAP to add more than 60,000 new SKUs to the network, nearly tripling from last year, and improved the key store availability KPI to the mid90s% up 100 basis points from Q1 and from the low 90% in the same period last year. At the same time, the company's continued rolling out its new assortment framework, now live in the top 30 DMAs and on track to be completed across the top 50 DAS, 70% of sales by the end of Q3, well ahead of the original 12 to 18month time frame that extended into 2026. Most importantly, the framework continues to deliver an average complift of 50 basis points. Eight. During the quarter, management proactively reorganized the debt capital structure, completing a $ 1.95 billion senior note offering, split into two equal tanches, maturing in 2030 and 2033. They also entered a new $1 billion assetbacked revolving credit facility to replace the prior $1 billion revolver. The additional liquidity provides flexibility for the supply chain financing program and management views the reorganization as a bridge to reattain investment grade credit rating, a material unlock for the business. Nine management continues to allocate substantial capex to refresh the store footprint. Already investing three times more maintenance and capex than all than in all of 2024. The spending has been applied to more than a thousand stores as part of a multi-year plan to enhance the instore experience for both consumers and store teams. For context, the previous model relied on a break fix approach for many years with 80% of the HVAC systems beyond useful life, over 50% of roofs aging out, and more than half of parking lots in need of replacement. Number 10, for fullear guidance, management reiterated net sales of 8.4 to 8.6 billion. Comp Store sales up uh 50 to 150 basis points and adjusted operating margins of 2 to 3%. Management did however adjust EPS guidance to reflect the higher interest expent from region debt offering bringing the target range to 120 to 220 per share versus a prior 150 to 250. Free cash flow is still expected to be negative 85 million to negative 25 million reflected a positive operating cash flow through the end of year offset set by 150 million in cash expenses related to the store optimization project. on to Etsy and we went through the call. You can go through our highlighted points uh at hedgefundtips.com. Scroll down to popular articles. It'll be in the number one post. Etsy update. Look at this beautiful free cash flow cash machine. Record cash flow, record high cash flow, record low price that will converge very soon. Revenue still climbing for the most part. and um a good turnaround plan or reaceleration plan in place. Let's go through the top 10 points. Number one, Etsy reported Q2 revenue of 673 million, up 3.8% year-onear and 25 million above consensus. The upside was largely driven by a significantly higher take rate of 24% expanding over 200 basis points year-over-year and exceeding prior guidance supported by a 15.3% year-on-year increase in seller services revenue. For Q3, management expects further take rate growth guiding to 24.5% for the quarter. Number two, consolidated gross merchandise sales for the quarter came in at 2.8 billion, down 4.8% 8% year-on-year, but showing a sequential improvement versus Q1's 6.5% decline and outperforming prior guidance that had anticipated a similar drop to Q1. Excluding Reverb, Q2 gross merchandise sales was 2.7 billion, down just 2.6% year-on-year compared to a 6.2% decline in Q1 on the same basis, stabilizing. The core Etsy marketplace remains the top priority with gross merchandise sales trends improving 350 basis points sequentially and posting positive year-on-year comps in both May and June. Three, Dep Depot continues to post strong results with GMS of 250 million during the quarter, up 35.3% year-onear and reaching an annualized run rate of $1 billion in GMS for the first time ever. Growth was led by a 54% increase in the US, making the fastest growing player in large online fashion resale market by a wide margin. Management believes the company has a significant runway with overall awareness remaining low and plans for accelerated investment in the marketplace in the back half of the year. Four management views the Etsy app as the key driver over the overall flywheel with app users showing significantly higher lifetime value, stronger loyalty, higher retention rates, and greater GMS per buyer. App GMS once again outpaced non-App GMS during Q2 and now represents 45% of total GMS, up more than 300 basis points year-on-year. Download rates remain strong and monthly active users are up 7% compared to last year. Five management continues to refine its marketing approach, shifting spending away from linear TV towards higher RORI channels and personalization. Consolidated marketing spend rose 16% year-on-year 212 million, including a nearly 50% sequ sequential increase in creator and influencer programs. Most importantly, the ramped up spend is translating into results Q2GMS from owned marketing channels. Email push notifications grew 33% year-on-year. Personalization now accounts for 40% of messages versus 27% in Q4 2024 drive driving higher conversion visits and GMS with management expecting near total personalization by year end six. During Q2 management reactivated 6.5 million buyers up 2.8% yearonear new buyers totaled 4.8 8 million down 14.5% year-on-year while trailing 12 month. Habitual buyers reached 6.1 million at quarter end down 12.12% 12.2% year-onear. Active seller count remained flat sequentially at 5.4 million. But the new seller startup fees has proven successful with a higher percentage of current active sellers making a sale in the past 12 months and an improvement in the number of new sellers completing a sale yearonar during Q2. Seven management repurchased a total of 335 million worth of shares during the quarter at an average price of 52.34 reducing the share count by 6.4 million. Another smart buyer back of stock buying at the lows issuing at the highs. When we get into the mid hundreds they uh will probably be sellers certainly not buyers. Eight free cash flow generated during the quarter totaled 90 million. A conversion rate of 82% of adjusted Ebidon a trailing 12-month base bringing the TTM free cash flow to 3 635 million implying a free cash flow yield of 10%. Management continues to expect healthy free cash flow for the full year thanks to an asset light business model supported by a sound balance sheet with 1.5 billion dollars of cash and just three billion in convertible debt uh including the 700 million issued in June nine. On June 2nd, management completed the 105 million allcash sale of Reverb the music marketplace acquired in 2019 for 275 million. The deal resulted in a 102 million impairment charge, but the business had long been a drag on growth and profitability with limited room for improvement. Management was happy to exit valuing the business at a mid- teens Ibida multiple and 10. Management noted continued strength in consumer spending across all cohorts with no major impact from tariffs or trade announcements. Spending stabilized in May and June and has held steady, giving management confidence to guide further improvement in Q3. Consolidated GMS is expected at 2.6 to 2.7 billion with the midpoint implying se sequential growth acceleration a 24.5% take rate and a 25% adjusted IBIDA margin. So go through the earnings call and our highlights at your leisure. Moving on to earnings. Biotech equal weight XBI um top 30 weights updated revisions earnings updated uh to 8.06% earnings growth for 2025. Uh 2026 estimates went up by 5.01%.

Dual mandate they need to be focused on. Now on to the incredible ask me anything questions. For those of you who like to this part of it, stick around. You're going to learn some great stuff. Those of you who just like the podcast, we'll see you next week from uh we'll be in New York. Busy busy week in New York. Uh playing in the beer beer league flight. um uh at my Connecticut club of the club championship. So, wish me luck. I've been kind of spotty. I mean, really up and down the last couple weeks. Couple nine handles on 18s and a couple three handles on nines. So, it's all putting. I'm I'm I'm I'm Anyway, it is what it is. All right. Uh thoughts on target? This is from Aaron Oda. Yeah, the market didn't like the fact that they brought in an insider. I mean, I think Target would probably double if they brought in that uh that girl who did the American Eagle, Sydney Sweeney. I kind of like it here. I gotta be honest. Uh what is that? 96 bucks. God, if I could get it with an eight handle again, I might actually even make it a position, but I'm not I'm not in a big rush to do that. But on balance, I think it's going to be okay. There is pressure obviously from Walmart and Amazon and everyone else, but I still think they have something unique. Not a great business, but at this price, it's not a bad business either. Lee Foster, what do you think about Brooker BBKR? I'm getting a lot of questions on this. There must be someone pushing it online. Um, let's see about Brooker. That's not the ticker, I don't think. B R U K E R B R K R [Music] H [Music] B R K R All right. Revenue is okay. Cash flow and margins decelerating. What do these guys do? Scientific instruments. Yeah. Medical devices. Um, [Music] which reminds me of Aluminina. Just depends how much of their sales. See, 194 million in cash. $2 billion of debt. That's uh that's a lot of debt. They must have done a deal here. Cash is not I have a lot of receivables. All right. Um [Music] not in love with this balance sheet. I got to be honest with you. Uh share account stable. revenues are okay. Look, I I just I think you'd probably be okay with this, but you better understand the moat of their products because if there's if if if there's a new entrant, uh this could be a real problem. On a superficial analysis, I would say there's enough here to start to do real work on it. Um instinct probably higher and better uses of capital, but you're probably in the ballpark. So, you got to listen to the last eight calls, start to read the public filings, start to read sellside research, start to do channel checks, understand the competitive environment and what what's unique about what they offer. Otherwise, it's just a race to the bottom, but generally probably okay. Uh, so good question, Nate Mariner. Thanks for everything you do. recommended hedge fund tips to my mother who's getting into managing her investments. Uh, thank you for that. What do you think about aluminina? This is the one that uh Carl Icon got bagged in and wound up puking up puking out in the hole. So, um [Music] I don't know. I think he got out for a reason, but this was a loser for him for sure. Revenues have been flat. Looks like free cash flow is recovering a little bit. Yeah, I think that I think it's going to be the same story as Brooker. You better know the product inside out and upside down and make sure that there's a moat there. Uh balance sheet looks. Share count's okay. 4 billion. Yeah, cash flow is okay. So >> I think it's worth starting work on but um yeah that's yeah it falls into the healthcare theme but you again this is not like oh the chart looks good and uh the balance sheets okay therefore buy it. That's like no now the 99% of the work starts and you're not looking for confirming. You're not looking to confirm your idea that it's a buy. You're looking to disprove your idea that it's a buy. And if you can't come with come up with any salient reasons not to buy it, then maybe you'd consider doing a position. It's always invert in investing because if you're just dealing from confirmation bias, you're always going to lose. So um you know, try to find 10 reasons not to buy it and if you and if you fail in that task, then you might have something. Uh okay, regular listener. This from Marcel Bala. Uh interesting. New to learn. uh regular listener always find something interesting new to learn. So so kind of look as team viewer What do they do? Remote connectivity solutions. I mean the issue here is me too. This is in the software category. The question is is this going to get disintermediated? I have no idea. Right now it looks great. Tomorrow it could be worth zero. Um just generally I mean unless the margin of safety is so great I'm generally not chomping at the bit to buy cheap software stocks just yet. So they've got 300 million of debt, 50 million of cash. Sales are growing. Share content. Look, from a financial standpoint, this thing warrants doing some serious work. Uh, but you better be damn sure that the moat is impenetrable and I can't just give someone a billion dollars to replicate it and put them out of business. That's the problem with software companies, which is why Buffett never did software, but financially looks great. I mean, good work, but now the work begins. So, uh, thanks for all the value you share. This is from Mangi Paul Mangi. question. You mentioned running 8 to 10 stocks. So what we do the what we do is when new money comes in, we put them in the best the reason we run in separately managed accounts is because we want to put new clients in those stocks that are just leaving the station, not already cruising at 30,000 ft. So um so each portfolio is going to have you know 8 to 12 stocks concentrated portfolio but we're not putting them in you know Cooper Standard at $35 after it's you know moved up from $5 where we initially bought it. The existing clients are going to hold it and ride it but we're not we're not going to put new clients in those. We're going to put them in the ones that are just getting going like VF Corp. uh like you know to a lesser extent uh well Bob has come off a lot off out off the bottom but that would be a position Intel if we can get it a little lower because it's moved up uh recently you know things that are just getting going uh a concentrated portfolio uh so yeah there's going to be a universe that's a little bigger than 8 to 12 um but they they're going to converge over time and um and I think we've done a really incredible job by doing it that way versus a coingle fund. All the money comes in after you've had a huge move and then the new people are getting in after the, you know, the everyone else is up 70%. Not ideal, okay? And then you're always going to get a 10 to 15% pullback after a huge run like that. But with SMAs, we can put them in those things that are just getting going so that they can have the next huge run in their concentrated portfolio. So, um, pretty good question. Thanks for tuning in. Eric B, could you look at Pittney Bose? No, we look at it every week and we continue to pass. Not for us. That's I know it's in a value trap. Everyone's crazy about it. It's not for us. Paul M, thanks for all you do. I'm hoping everyone shares your pod with friends as much as I do so you keep doing this forever. Thank you. Could you please let me know your thoughts on XPv? Uh we're not buying any Chinese stocks other than Alibaba. Um, and as far as the race to the bottom, some of those one, you know, gamble and win, pick Neo, you know, maybe pick Neo, pick XP, pick three other BYD, one of them, you'll get a home run. The rest won't that that's just gambling. It's not for me. I never want to be in the auto manufacturing business. I want to be in the arms dealer business like Cooper Standard. Abashek Gupta, been applying your way of looking at companies. Could you let me know? Uh you're thinking on consensus cloud solutions CCSI [Music] revenues have not moved in three years. Neither of margins looks okay. Let let me take a look. [Music] information delivery software as a service. Again, they have EAX, my fax, metrofax. I mean, I don't know. I I this is not the type of business that I would be interested in. I mean, tell me why and how their remote is going to be durable. Again, this is software. Yes, it looks cheap and yes, it may the the fear over AI may pass soon as people realize that it's not going to do everything for you, but um this looks like a runoff business with revenue so flat. And given that they're doing myax and eax, it probably is a runoff business. just people who have the subscription and forgot that they do because they no longer need it. Um, and I'm sure they do some other things, but what's the moat? And how do they reacelerate growth with uh with all this cash? Let's see. 350 million of cash. They probably have zero debt. Well, hold on for a sec. [Music] Half a billion dollars of debt, 34 million in cash. Sold to you. Not interested. Let's move on. Jimmy Jones, Professor Tom, if Baba reaches his intrinsic value, would you still sell it before the ant IPO or wait? Uh, yeah, I would sell it. If it's already pricing in all the good that I expect, I'm going to sell it. But we're nowhere remotely even in the zip code of being ready to do that anytime soon. Can you look at ATRO? My guess is um the Ant IPO will come sooner than um any price that's more than double from these levels. ATRO. This is from Roger Bamante from Puerto Rico. All right. Love it. I got some friends in Puerto Rico. Uh actually a few friends. Um one you heard from a couple of weeks ago and uh couple others that are that are coming in as very very big clients. So we're excited for that. Uh, found this on Twitter backlog. All right. It's already had a run. Roger. Why weren't you giving this to me at eight bucks? Why are you giving it to me at 37 bucks? It's already up 4x now. Is it going higher? Probably. But we prefer things when no one wants them. The fact that it's up 4x in a handful of months is because people are starting to want it. Um, you know, it's just inflecting and the price started to sniff that out ahead of time. So, uh, yeah, it probably goes higher, but no, I wouldn't be a buyer right now, even though it'll probably go higher. Yeah, good idea. Not the best time. Theo Djardan, thanks for all you do. Blah blah blah. You're welcome, by the way. very grateful. Also, great work on the interview with growth, Daryl and the coaching you give to young and aspiring students. My hats off. Thank you very much. I appreciate that. All right. So, he's asking all these complicated questions about Cooper Standard. Oh, this is from Portugal, by the way. Very nice. Djardan sounds French. Yeah. So, these are all short-term questions. This is a secular play that we'll be out of in three or four years, unless it hits intrinsic value sooner. I don't care about the short-term volatility. Uh, this is another one I'd be a buyer with new money uh right now, even though our basis is much lower. So, thank you for all the kind words and um ignore the short-term noise. CROA International, this is from Robert Davis. [Music] Yeah, this is a broken growth stock. So, see Yeah, this thing this thing hurt a lot of people. It's going to take a long time to build a new shareholder base. Um, they just continue, you know, their their return on invested capital is well, I'm sure well below their cost of capital. Not an ideal situation. Revenue is just showing a small sign of recovery. Life science fragrances and flavors. Oh yeah, this is uh it's been around since 1925. Uh yeah, this is like IFF. I think these this group is ready to start to participate again, but [Music] 28 million in cash. 700 million. Yeah. They're increasing the share count a little bit. That's okay. [Music] Well, it's not okay, but it's not egregious. Beauty care, home care, fragrances, and flavors 1925. I mean, it is adorable business, but [Music] [Music] Um ah let me see quarterly What's going on? Uh, this is this is not as much of a slam dunk as it looks like it is, Robert, but I think it does warrant doing some work. I I would go listen to the last eight conference calls. What did they say they were going to do? What have they done? What have they promised for the turnaround? What is happening? Um, and try to find 10 reasons not to buy it. That's the whole goal. It's it's it's to figure out why not to get involved versus why to get involved and then being perfectly okay if you miss it. Error of omission versus commission. Um [Music] I do like this chemical space though. So do the work. I think it's okay. I don't know that I'm going to do any work on this one, but I might. So, if that's helpful to you, great. John Clarks, we cover this every day. Maybe you get lucky and you win. There's no transparency in those consumer finance portfolios and you still have a bad ombre running the country. So, hard pass for now. All right. Oh, Djardan, you're trying to sneak in uh two questions in the back door. Don't know if I love this, my friend, but since you flattered me with the awesome work on growth, Daryl. Looking forward to becoming a client because you've grown your portfolio. Uh you buttered me up enough. Let's go. Bosch Health. This is one that um John Pollson's been bagged in forever. Uh I keep looking at it and I keep passing. I just think it's this is like your quintessential definition of a value trap that may eventually work. But like I mean revenues have been flat for 10 years. So now your bet is that they just keep buying in the shares because it's a runoff business and uh that's not that exciting to me. [Music] Let's see if the numbers can prove me wrong. All right. So, there's some acceleration. So, find out what happened between 2023 and 2024. My guess is it's either new business or an acquisition. Uh or if they figured out how to turn around the legacy business. Uh share count's kind of holding in there. 1 billion of cash. $20 billion of debt. Hard pass. Not for me. On to the next. I mean, a lot of leverage there. If they don't go bankrupt, it's going to be incredible. But, uh, I pay more attention to the former part of the sentence than the latter. M Globosnik, thoughts on Zimmer biotech. I think yes, without even looking at it, this falls in the back category, which is poised. Uh, I just don't think you have nearly as much upside, so I'm not even going to do a crazy thing, but I think you're right, Manny B. Portillo. Uh, yeah, Mimi likes Portillo. There's so many in this space. Jack in the Box. Portillos. What's going on with Portillos? This is not a business I really like. Do we have any restaurants? Wow. What the hell? Big P&L today. Holy cow. Cooper Sanders up 17%. Oh my god. All right. Wow. Um, holy All right. Here we go. Uh, Portillos, uh, free cash flow negative. That's probably a financial issue here. Balance sheet. Revenues are growing. They're growing the share account, too. I don't like that. Let's see. Um, yeah, look, I think with this 22 million of cash, how much debt do they have? 11. I think with this, you just have to you got to you got to listen to the store. Listen to the calls. Are the comp store sales going up or down? If they're going up, that means it's a good business model. Then you got to listen to how we're going to expand all over the country and what actions are they taking? Because if it's just regional, like I've only seen them in Chicago and Texas, uh, and they're profitable on a store-by store basis and they're um the comp store sales are growing and they're going to expand, then you could have an unbelievable story like a Dunkin Donut. So, I think uh I think this one's worth looking into, Manny. Let me put that down. PT Lo, but I don't want to get stuck in a Dell Taco or Sweet Green or all these lower end dog. You know what businesses? Jack in the Box. I mean, that's that's garbage, but I think that one's going to work. Chris Williamson, Brooker, we already did it. Thanks for the question. Julio Flores, thanks for the great listeners. short-term. [Music] Yeah, Julio, look, he's saying, "Is it ahead of itself because they're not earning, you know, a$150 or $3 yet?" No, because they're nowhere near cyclical peak volumes. you know, if we were at 17.5 million of volume and the thing was earning, you know, well, I think on 17 and a half they're going to earn 10 this time around and the stock was trading at, you know, $200, so 20 times, then I would say, all right, we're, you know, we're fully valued here, I I mean, at that point, the price targets would all go up to 300 and 350 and all that stuff, and we we're we're probably taking, you know, closing out the whole position at that point. Um, but this turnaround inflection is just getting started and uh we're more focused on SAR than we are the short-term quarterly uh day-to-day. So, no, I don't think it's fully ahead of I don't I don't I mean what I would say is incentives volumes that that's early days. So, leave it at that. John Salper, does your philosophy change when it comes to an IRA account? You won't touch till feel like the best fed when it comes to them is buy some ETF. Well, look, I think you want to set and forget. So he's saying like I think in your IRA it's a tax advantage account. So that's where you want to be in in my view I you know this opinion not advice. I think that's where you can be in individual stocks and options because you're not paying tax when you get out of it whether it's in three years or 3 months whereas that you know buying an index and sitting on it forever you can do that in a taxable account because you're never selling it. So, I would take advantage of the tax rapper to uh have some of your more aggressive stuff in my humble opinion. Again, talk to your psychic, financial advisor, everyone before you do anything. All right. Uh GEC, we covered that Daniel last week. Is this question from last week? Yeah, seven days ago. So, let's just quickly maybe I didn't get to it last week. It's okay. It's not the one I want to play, so I'll leave it at that. Next, York. This is from seven days ago. Yeah. So, York, you're asking all these questions. Just just get your CFA. Um, and then you got to go through experience like why did I know not to buy Lulu even though it was down? Why did I know uh when to get involved in CCI uh versus being too early? Um it's it's just a lot of experience. You got you just got to put in the years. Um and like I said, this business, it's like you're you'll make a lot more money starting a business in the short term and if you're really successful in the the long term. But in this business, if you can go 20 years and live to tell the story, you're going to make obscene amounts of money. That's all I can tell you. Because by then, you're really effing good. Um, and um, and you know, it's a very narrow group that can generate performance and money flocks to it. So, um, that's my best advice to a very long question. And congrats to you and your, uh, your homies who tune in every single week. We're very excited to have you, Drew. uh grateful for your thoughts uh on Selan C. CE is basically a balance sheet story. I kind of like the group. This one's a little more levered. Um, [Music] yeah, international fragrances and flavors. Uh, got a strong eye on that one. A lot of insider buying lately. durable long-term business. Haven't done anything with that either. Let's see where we at. Income statement here. Balance sheet is the issue with sellies. They'll probably be fine. I mean, there's a lot of leverage in this with 10 billion of debt and a billion dollars of cash. They're generating a half a billion of free cash flow. What's the uh Yeah, I would just pull up the entire cap table and find out how much is maturing at what years for the next 10 years and make a best probabilistic assessment based on rating and maturity and um current financing costs and projected financing costs whether you think they're if if they're going to remain solvent the stock is going to triple. If they're not you're you got a problem and I would bet on the former that they are going to remain solvent and the stock is going to triple but you have to burden yourself with the facts by doing the work. So, good question, Drew, and thanks for all your support. And with that said, oh, Al asks if I'm going to be in uh I think I'm in Sarasota in December. Okay. And that's that. So, with that said, we'll be back next week. Same time, different place. In the meantime, make it a great one. Bye for now. [Music] Heat. Heat. [Music] [Music] [Music]
