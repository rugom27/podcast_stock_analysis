[00:00:00] Welcome to Hedge Fund Tips with Tom Hayes. I'm Tom Hayes and this is your 321st video cast podcast for the week
[00:00:08] ending December 11th, 2025. We got a lot of great stuff to cover today. Uh and a
[00:00:14] very very special guest interview, which you are going to love. The CEO of one of
[00:00:21] our big holdings. Super excited for that. But as always, family first dug up
[00:00:28] one of these videos. uh pictures of Mimi and Annabelle. I think this was from six
[00:00:33] years ago. Time flies. Uh then we got uh
[00:00:38] this is from this weekend walking around by the new place. Uh which is pretty
[00:00:43] exciting. Uh that was from last week, Thursday, when I was still in New York in the green room. I got my driver back
[00:00:51] yesterday. I've been really struggling with it the last three weeks and my buddies over at Urban Golf uh shout out
[00:00:59] to Matt and Chris uh got me back on track. Those of you who are golfers will know that this is a pretty good position
[00:01:06] for ball striking and uh I was hitting the hell out of it yesterday. I'm super excited. Uh and then this is a reindeer.
[00:01:14] We did the uh Christmas walk locally here and they actually had a real reindeer in 65 degree weather. I don't
[00:01:21] know how good that is for the reindeer, but there's Annabelle in the background. I've actually never seen a reindeer in
[00:01:27] person. Uh, so that was pretty exciting. Uh, then had the pleasure to join the
[00:01:34] great Stu Vney on Fox Business and you see Lauren Simeonetti there, uh, who's
[00:01:40] fantastic and want to thank Payton Jennings for having me on in studio.
[00:01:45] We're going to listen in here. You see, the producers are listening.
[00:01:51] Bing Crosby is the voice of Christmas in my personal opinion. Certainly for my generation, you go back half a century
[00:01:57] and you get Bing Crosby. That's beautiful though, isn't it? That's Christmas music. That's right. Ain't that right, Tom Hayes?
[00:02:03] I agree. And you're going to support me on this, aren't you? 100%. Lauren's not so sure. No, I I love it. I was just thinking
[00:02:08] these days kids like the pop Christmas music. Yeah. Well, these kids do. Yeah. Am I a kid? He said,
[00:02:13] "No, you're a traditionalist." That is true. Vintage. Nicely done, Laura. Nicely done. And good morning,
[00:02:19] everyone. It's 10:00. A little red for the Dow. It's up 40 points. NASDAQ's down 32. There's not that much price
[00:02:26] change on the downside thus far. Tom Hayes joins me. He's looking at the market for us. Everybody and his brother
[00:02:33] who comes on this program says, "Yeah, we're going to get a year-end rally." You saying the same thing? Only the Fed
[00:02:40] could screw this up with a 90% chance of a cut next week. If they surprise the
[00:02:46] market with a hold, that would be the only thing that could cause a year-end weakness. When the stock market, it is
[00:02:53] is up 10% through October on average. The December rally is not the normal
[00:02:58] 1.2%. It's 2% or greater. And that usually starts the 14th or 15th of the month.
[00:03:06] and it is usually dominated by small cap stocks. Small caps have the strongest
[00:03:12] period of outperformance from December 15th through March. So that's where you're going to get the biggest bang for
[00:03:18] your buck. So I should invest in the Russell 2000. Russell 2000 December 14th or 15th. Just
[00:03:23] get through that Fed meeting. Make sure they're on board. As long as they're on board, we're going to rally. We got earnings growth in the S&P. Quantitative
[00:03:30] tightening stopped in December. uh 316 cuts across global central banks this
[00:03:36] year. We are a wash in liquidity. We just need that final piece ne next week. Just watch out for the PCE inflation
[00:03:43] report tomorrow morning. That's right. That could upset the apple car. That's right. It could. We shall see for sure. But you don't think it will?
[00:03:49] I don't think it will. I think uh for the Fed to back up after the market is expecting a 90 90% odds that would be
[00:03:55] very very risky for Powell. But uh uh he's done it before December 2018. So,
[00:04:00] uh, until it's done, it's not done. Until it's done, it's not done. I got it. Tom Hayes, you're all right. Thanks very much. Indeed. Still ahead. Thomas,
[00:04:07] what do you think of the Trump accounts? I love them. There's something called the rule of 72. Okay. You take the rate
[00:04:14] of return, which on an index fund would be about 10% a year. Divide 72, which
[00:04:19] means your money doubles every 7.2 years. So, if you start with a,000, by
[00:04:25] the time you're 18, you basically have 16,000. But if you get granddad, grandma to throw in a little bit and you start
[00:04:31] with 10,000, you're starting college with 160,000. So the one grows to two,
[00:04:36] grows to four, grows to eight, etc. And if you hold that money till you're 40, uh, exactly what JC was talking about,
[00:04:42] you wind up with a couple mill. I shall try to remember that. Yeah, you know, Tom, good stuff. Thank you very much indeed.
[00:04:48] On the markets, I see uh 24 points up for the Dow, virtually no change for the
[00:04:54] S&P and for the NASDAQ. Okay, Tom Scotty's special stock picks and he
[00:04:59] leads off with Fizer. Yep. As we always say, Stu, when the downside is protected, the upside takes
[00:05:05] care of itself. This appears to be a boring stock, but they just did the Metsa deal, which is a once a month GLP,
[00:05:12] one uh uh both that you can inject and will eventually become oral. They bought
[00:05:17] uh CGEN. They've got four new oncology drugs, but most importantly, they cut 7.2 billion in costs. Margins are
[00:05:24] increasing. Revenues are increasing. It's trading at eight times forward and you get a 7% dividend yield while you
[00:05:31] wait. Okay, I like this dividend. This is a sleepy stock that's going to surprise
[00:05:36] people over the next couple of years and go up a lot more because healthcare is in the gutter and it's coming out like a
[00:05:42] phoenix from the ash. Okay. Okay. Okay. I'll take the 7% dividend. All right. Okay. PayPal. You got 30 seconds. Give me PayPal.
[00:05:48] Okay. This reminds me of a company that we bought two years ago when no one wanted it that was generating huge free
[00:05:54] cash flow. you couldn't give it away. It was called Alibaba. No one wanted to buy it. The thing took off. It's tripled off
[00:06:00] the bottom. PayPal is going to be a very similar situation, generating 6 to 7 billion a year of free cash flow. Uh
[00:06:07] Alex Chris came from in it. He had a 38 bagger while he ran the small business
[00:06:12] unit at into it. Margins are increasing. Revenues are reacelerating. No one is
[00:06:17] paying attention. 30 seconds. And this is going to be this is going to be a great stock over the next two years.
[00:06:22] The hand is down. You don't pound the table confidence on that one. Thanks. All right, let's see what we got
[00:06:29] now. Look at Meta, Tom. This is for you. Look at that 4% gain for Meta. Tell me
[00:06:34] more. You know, Charlie Mer once said, "I'm all for artificial intelligence because natural intelligence is so rare." Uh
[00:06:40] here's an example with Meta. The stock is up. The market likes it. They're cutting their spend on the metaverse,
[00:06:45] which was a flop. They're investing in AI. The market likes it. The stock's going to continue to follow the theme.
[00:06:51] All right, Tom. Thank you. Thank you, Lauren. And thank you Tom Hayes for being with me for the hour. I appreciate that.
[00:06:57] And we're back. And then I had the pleasure to join David Aman also on
[00:07:02] Varnney and co-f Fox Business. Thanks to Payton Jennings just yesterday before the Fed meeting. We'll listen in here.
[00:07:09] Meanwhile, Thomas Hayes joins me now. Thomas, great to see you. The Fed of course is expected to cut about a
[00:07:15] quarter of a percent today. Uh there's I think a 90% chance that's going to
[00:07:20] happen. But the question is how Powell answers questions and whether or not he's going to cap any further rate cuts
[00:07:28] uh to some very strict limitations. What do you think the market's going to make of it?
[00:07:33] Well, I think that's exactly right, David. We will get a cut today. The question is the rhetoric and more importantly the summary of economic
[00:07:40] projections in September. The projections implied we would get a cut in December and then only one more cut
[00:07:48] in 2026. market doesn't want to see that again. They want to see at least two cuts in 2026. So, if there's no change
[00:07:56] in the summary of economic projections, the market might not be happy in the very short term. But have no fear,
[00:08:02] David, because Santa is here. The Santa Claus rally historically starts since
[00:08:08] 1950 on the 14th or 15th of December. The reason for that, David, is because
[00:08:14] of individual tax law selling. So most individuals spend the first two weeks of
[00:08:19] December selling off their losers. The stocks that did not work for the year
[00:08:25] and in this year the stocks that did not work were defensive stocks, dividend
[00:08:30] payers like consumer staples, healthc care, the boring stocks and dividend
[00:08:35] payers, which by the way work extremely well in an easing cycle. So we've got a
[00:08:42] couple of those for you. Well, and one of them is Papa John's. Why do you like it? Papa John's 4 and
[00:08:47] a.5% dividend yield. New CEO came from Wendy's. He ran Wendy's from 2016 to
[00:08:53] 2024. Had a threebagger when he was turning that around. Comp Store sales
[00:08:58] are up 2%. They're re franchising 85 units which is adding to free cash flow.
[00:09:05] They took guidance up and everyone loves pizza. It's a no-brainer. And by the way, as you were talking, it
[00:09:10] went from red into the green. It's now up a quarter of a percent. Hormel is entering a phase of growth. Why is that?
[00:09:17] Another dividend payer. The highest yield we've seen in a long time. They've been paying a dividend every single year
[00:09:23] since 1928, David. And for the last 60 years, it's been a dividend aristocrat,
[00:09:29] which means it raised the dividend every single year. So, not only do you lock in a 5% dividend yield, but odds are it's
[00:09:36] going to go up every single year. They've got a whole suite that's right in line with the GLP1 theme high protein
[00:09:43] snacks from the sausages to the spam to the stew to the planters peanuts to the
[00:09:49] Skippy etc. Uh this thing is now reacelerating. Some of the tariffs on
[00:09:55] food have been rolled back. Uh it's a strong healthy dividend and we think this defensive dividend payer is going
[00:10:01] to do well in a midterm election year which tends to be volatile. Tom Hayes, great information. Thank you
[00:10:07] so much for being here. Have a wonderful holiday. Let's get back to this survey that shows
[00:10:13] and we're back. And now for the grand finale, we had the CEO of GXO Logistics
[00:10:23] on our podcast one- on-one interview. Absolutely incredible interview. You're
[00:10:30] going to want to listen in here. Why? Because GXO is the embodiment of playing
[00:10:35] the AI beneficiaries that will have margin expansion and increased
[00:10:41] productivity as a result of utilizing the tool versus the hyperscalers whose
[00:10:47] capex is now higher uh than big oil.
[00:10:52] Okay. Uh capex as a percentage of operating cash flow uh margin compression. They are the spenders. We
[00:10:59] are the beneficiaries and GXO embodies that. Can't thank CEO Patrick Kellaher
[00:11:07] enough and chairman Brad Jacobs uh for uh for setting this up. Uh we're going
[00:11:13] to listen in here and take good notes. Well, I'm Tom Hayes, chairman and
[00:11:19] managing member of Great Hill Capital, and we have an extremely special guest on today on Hedge Fund Tips with Tom
[00:11:26] Hayes, the CEO of GXO Logistics, Mr. Patrick Keller. Patrick, thank you so
[00:11:33] much for coming on today. Absolutely, Tom. Thank you for having me. Well, everyone knows uh we we talk about
[00:11:40] companies that we own. We've had a nicesized position in your company for some time. Uh, and let's get right down
[00:11:47] to the questions. That's just in full disclaimer. Uh, before we before we dive into the business, I want to start with
[00:11:54] your background uh, and your decision to join GXO. You bring more than three
[00:11:59] decades of global supply chain experience and most recently as CEO of
[00:12:04] DHL Supply Chain North America, where you oversaw significant growth,
[00:12:09] operational improvements, and the roll out of advanced automation initiatives. Uh Brad Jacobs uh who we also own QXO,
[00:12:17] full disclosure, described you as a world-class operator with the experience to lead GXO through its next phase of
[00:12:24] growth. You've als uh you've also mentioned that you've watched GXO quote with a lot of admiration and maybe even
[00:12:32] a little envy since the spin-off in 2021. From that vantage point as a
[00:12:37] former competitor, what is it about GXO that made you want to join the company?
[00:12:42] And now that you're on the inside, what has stood out most, whether it's the technology, the culture, or the
[00:12:49] performance mindset that reinforces your conviction in the opportunity ahead?
[00:12:55] Thanks, H. I'm thrilled to be uh at GXO, and as you shared, I have a 32-year
[00:13:00] career in supply chain. I majored in supply chain in college. Uh I started with a company called Excel Logistics
[00:13:06] that was acquired by DHL in 2005 all the way back in 1992.
[00:13:12] And my entire supply chain career has been focused and in the contract logistics industry which is and
[00:13:18] continues to still be a massive industry 500 billion in the uh total addressable
[00:13:25] market. Wow. It is fragmented globally and it continues to grow. Throughout my career
[00:13:30] at DHL I held a number of different roles which I thought think gives me a great perspective uh on the industry
[00:13:37] competing in the industry and especially providing great services for customers. most notably probably the last two roles
[00:13:43] that I held at DHL. Uh I was from 2017 to 2023 the chief development officer
[00:13:49] globally for DHL supply chain responsible for global sales, marketing,
[00:13:54] product development, our market verticals and M&A uh during that period of time and it gave me a great global
[00:14:00] perspective of the health of the market uh where the market is especially dynamic uh and where the growth
[00:14:07] opportunities exist uh and really was uh a great foundation for my new role at
[00:14:14] GXO. But as you say, uh, I've watched GXO since 2021 in the spin-off, I think
[00:14:20] by GXO going public and really being the pure play contract logistics leader in
[00:14:27] the industry, uh, one of the few, if only publicly traded really, I think,
[00:14:32] put definition to the contract logistics market, created awareness within the market around um, the industry uh, and
[00:14:39] the great potential that the industry has. When I got the call from Brad on the opportunity to lead, uh it was uh an
[00:14:47] easy decision for me. Having been in the the industry for for a long time, loving
[00:14:52] the industry, admiring GXO, uh I was especially excited about the opportunity
[00:14:59] to join uh a pure play contract logistics organization. I think that comes with uh agility uh a very special
[00:15:08] dimension of customer focus in the services that we're providing. I love the speed of decision-m capital
[00:15:14] allocation decisions, investment and technology decisions that are being made. We are moving very fast. I love
[00:15:21] the agility and speed at which I'm able to move uh as a pure play public company
[00:15:27] in this space. Yeah, and as you say, I've watched GXO with uh en envy and admiration since 2021 as
[00:15:34] well, and especially with GXO's position as a tech leader in the space. GXO has
[00:15:40] really been on the forefront of piloting robotics, automation, uh AI now, humanoids now, uh we have in our
[00:15:47] facility, which is really exciting, waking up every day working on that. And
[00:15:53] I think that coupled with the global scale that GXO has, the vertical expertise that has been built,
[00:15:59] especially through M&A uh over the last four years, it is a phenomenal platform
[00:16:05] for growth, and we're really focused on ushering in a new era of growth at GXO.
[00:16:10] I love that. That's music to my ears. Patrick, uh I I I want to drill down on
[00:16:16] North America, which you made a clear priority on your inaugural earnings call after taking over as CEO. Uh the US
[00:16:24] generated uh business generated about 3.1 billion in revenue in 2024, roughly
[00:16:29] 26% of GXO's total. Uh small share of the 250 billion plus North American
[00:16:35] market, which speaks to the size of the opportunity we still have ahead. uh having led DHL supply chain North
[00:16:42] America, this is a market you know extremely well and you've already highlighted near near-term opportunities
[00:16:48] to accelerate growth across the region. You've pointed to aerospace and defense, industrial and life science as key
[00:16:55] verticals for expansion. Uh brought in Michael Jacobs as president of the Americas and Asia-Pacific and
[00:17:01] reallocated resources towards sales and marketing to strengthen the company's position. Could you speak to what you're
[00:17:08] doing differently in North America to compete and win new business whether in terms of your go to market strategy or
[00:17:15] vertical focus to unlock uh more of that 250 plus billion dollar opportunity? Uh
[00:17:22] and secondly, as you scale into higher value sectors like aerospace, defense and life sciences, how should investors
[00:17:29] think about the impact on margins and mix compared with the more mature omni
[00:17:34] channel retail business? Sure. That's that that's a great question and I've
[00:17:40] been very clear that North America's a priority market for us. I think to put that into context, uh about twothirds of
[00:17:47] our business globally is in the UK and Europe. Uh that is the result of a
[00:17:54] really strong and successful M&A effort in those geographies. Yeah, GXO has doubled in size from a revenue
[00:18:00] perspective since the spin-off in 2021 and that has been on the back of a lot of M&A particularly in those two
[00:18:07] theaters. Those uh M&A transactions brought with it great vertical expertise
[00:18:14] in technology, industrial and aerospace especially and then most recently with the acquisition of Win Canton brought
[00:18:21] great capabilities uh in the defense space. In looking at GXO, GXO has
[00:18:28] underdelivered from a growth perspective in North America in comparison to the market growth that we have seen in
[00:18:34] contract logistics and in comparison to competitive peers. So it is very clear
[00:18:40] that with all of the capabilities and competencies that we have, we need uh to focus more on North America as a key uh
[00:18:48] growth driver for us organically going forward. And so we've already taken big
[00:18:54] steps in uh uh positioning ourselves uh to really compete and win in North
[00:18:59] America. We've announced Michael Jacobs coming into the organization. He is leading North America and our Asia
[00:19:05] business. Michael's a 30-year veteran of the industry. He and I have worked together for 25 plus years of that with
[00:19:13] him as my customer, by the way. So he is coming from uh the customer side most
[00:19:18] recently with Ferguson Enterprises, Kurt Green Mountain before that and Toys R Us before that. So he's got phenomenal
[00:19:25] operating competencies. He understands what our customers are looking for in a
[00:19:30] contract logistics provider. Uh and he's lining up his team to make sure that we're delivering against that every day.
[00:19:37] As you mentioned from a market vertical perspective, we are putting additional
[00:19:42] emphasis on what I call the B2B verticals. That is aerospace, defense, life sciences, technology and our
[00:19:49] industrial sector. About 70% of our business at GXO is associated with
[00:19:55] consumerf facing verticals that is e-commerce, omni channel, uh CPG and uh
[00:20:01] bricks and mortar retail. And so we really want to seek some diversification in uh the size of our market verticals.
[00:20:09] We are already well positioned especially because of the M&A completed with the competencies, the talented
[00:20:15] people um and the capabilities in aerospace defense and the other B2B verticals uh to execute successfully for
[00:20:23] customers and we're investing in the organic growth of those spaces. We're
[00:20:28] very focused on us uh spinning up even further our digital marketing engine. We've already hired new salespeople,
[00:20:35] especially in the area of aerospace and defense, leaning on industry veterans to
[00:20:41] help us get in the right conversations for growth in that area. We're standing up an advisory board of uh former
[00:20:48] military uh uh veterans who are are going to help us navigate uh the defense
[00:20:54] space and understand where we can best serve customers, deliver value based on the capabilities of GXO and from that uh
[00:21:03] we think we are so well positioned uh to win in North America. this on top of um
[00:21:11] the also great work that we're doing from a technology perspective in the efforts around AI, our new GXO IQ
[00:21:18] solution which is the path to our facilities for the deployment of AI. Uh
[00:21:24] we think uh we think we're going to be very successful in North America and that is really important to our organic
[00:21:30] growth and as well as margin expansion for the business. Love it. Love it. Well, Patrick, I I
[00:21:36] want to touch on an area that's uh often often a challenge for transportation and
[00:21:41] logistics companies, but increasingly actually looks like a potential major tailwind for GXO, and that's uh tariffs
[00:21:49] and the growing reshoring trends that we're seeing as a result. Uh at the time of the spin, GXO estimated the total
[00:21:56] addressable market of roughly 430 billion across North America and Europe with about 300 billion of that spend
[00:22:03] still handled inhouse. Uh whether it's manufacturing returning to the US or
[00:22:08] companies bringing warehousing back to local markets to reduce fulfillment costs and complexity, these shifts seem
[00:22:14] like a real shot in the arm for the outsourcing trend. Uh you've also mentioned increased customer interest in
[00:22:21] foreign trade zones with GXO now operating more than 70 FTZ locations
[00:22:27] globally and exploring further expansion of that footprint which feels like a real validation of that trend. Uh could
[00:22:33] you first speak to how tariffs and reshoring trends are influencing customer decisions around outsourcing
[00:22:40] and what kind of tailwind you see that uh creating for GXO? uh how is the
[00:22:46] company positioning itself to capture that in-house spend as these shifts accelerate? And and more broadly, how do
[00:22:54] you view the long-term opportunity these structural trends present as supply chains continue to localize and the
[00:23:00] outsourcing cycle gains momentum. Starting with tariffs, tariffs are a
[00:23:06] catalyst for supply chain efficiency and and we're seeing that happen uh broadly across the business and for the contract
[00:23:12] logistics industry. Anytime you have economic disruption or
[00:23:18] what could be perceived as an economic headwind or change like a tariff coming in, it is an inspiration to drive
[00:23:25] towards more supply chain efficiency and uh and it creates a willingness on a
[00:23:30] part of our customers to make changes in their supply chain to capture those opportunities. I think in your reference
[00:23:36] to FTZ, we're operating about 70 around the world. uh that solution is becoming
[00:23:42] dramatically more interesting to customers. The price point at which uh it made sense to flow product through
[00:23:48] NFTTZ was significantly higher last year than it is today. uh and now to where product
[00:23:55] of 20 $30 value individual value uh do have an ROI associated with FTZ and
[00:24:03] leveraging a strategy of deferring um the tariff and uh duty payments for cash
[00:24:09] flow benefit and I think it's really fascinating uh that these headwinds uh
[00:24:15] or perceived headwinds of things like tariffs can create supply chain change that really becomes permanent and those
[00:24:21] efficiencies become permanent uh in the overall uh supply chain execution um uh ecosystem. And so for
[00:24:31] our business as customers are wrestling with how to address uh the nearshoring
[00:24:36] of manufacturing, the tariffs and so forth, that is all necessitating supply
[00:24:41] chain change and that is good for the industry. That is great for GXO because we're really well positioned to respond
[00:24:48] to respond to that. Additionally, from an industry perspective, and we're so
[00:24:54] well positioned as GXO, as the complexity of automation, robotics, AI,
[00:25:00] the technology stack, and the technology ecosystem that is required to address increasing supply chain complexity is
[00:25:08] evolving. We are best positioned to service our customers in executing supply chain
[00:25:13] solutions versus the in-house solution of having to build the equivalent technology stack, technology ecosystem
[00:25:21] plugged into the tools of robotics, automation and AI to enable the execution of of complex supply chain
[00:25:28] solutions. And so we are really focused as GXO in investing in that ecosystem.
[00:25:36] We think it provides real competitive differentiation not only from other contract logistics providers but
[00:25:42] especially from the decisions that our customers are making every day of whether they should insource or
[00:25:48] outsource. And it is going to be increasingly difficult to build and replicate what GXO has in place and is
[00:25:55] continuing to build uh around the systems tools and processes and especially the people that execute those
[00:26:03] solutions on a daily basis. Love it. Well, that's that's really helpful. Patrick, I I want to shift
[00:26:09] gears. I want to talk about organic growth uh which you've made clear is your top priority coming in and
[00:26:16] something you've said you really thrive on. Uh at the height of the e-commerce boom GXO was growing at high teens pace
[00:26:23] even reaching 20%. Then came the abrupt rotation from goods to services and the
[00:26:28] resulting dto cycle which led to a sharp slowdown with organic growth bottoming in Q4 2023. We saw that across many uh
[00:26:37] portfolio companies for us uh and that was the clear inflection point that that quarter marked the inflection point and
[00:26:44] since then grown uh growth has steadily improved with Q2 this year the strongest
[00:26:49] in more than 2 years and fullear guidance suggesting another step up heading into 2026 with that recovery
[00:26:56] firmly underway and nearly 700 million in incremental revenue already secured for next year. How do you view the
[00:27:03] organic growth potential of the business today? And as you think about what's driving the acceleration, whether
[00:27:09] volumes, pipeline conversion, or expansion into new verticals, where do you see the greatest opportunity to
[00:27:16] sustain the momentum and define what feels like a new era for GXO?
[00:27:22] It is a new era of growth at at GXO with the priority on organic growth. We are
[00:27:28] still going to embark on M&A. M&A will be very focused on the North America
[00:27:33] market and in the B2B industrial verticals that I talked about of aerospace, defense, technology, life
[00:27:39] sciences and industrial as you say in 2021 GXO is enjoying
[00:27:46] organic growth of high teens even as high as 20%. Um and this year we will
[00:27:51] deliver uh mids singledigit organic growth. We want to ramp back up uh to our full potential in that area. We
[00:27:58] haven't given 2026 guidance on that yet. Uh but we will be at an investor day in
[00:28:04] 2026 and everyone should look forward to that. But it doesn't take away the
[00:28:10] absence of the guidance doesn't take away from the belief that we have that that we are capable of more uh with
[00:28:16] respect to organic growth uh and already putting actions in place to deliver
[00:28:21] against that. I mentioned that we're participating in a big market over a half a billion globally. Uh and today we
[00:28:28] only hold about 3% market share in that and the market continues to grow. Everything I've read suggests a 6 to 8%
[00:28:35] KER for the contract logistics industry uh through 2030. Uh and we're well
[00:28:40] positioned to capture uh our fair share and beyond uh of that growth. In terms of the actions that that were taken, the
[00:28:47] organization has been very focused up until this point and we are at an inflection point as GXO as the
[00:28:53] organization has been very focused on M&A and digesting that M&A that has
[00:28:59] positioned the scale and the capability and the competencies that we need in order to deliver organic growth. And
[00:29:05] it's really time that that we accelerate that organic growth for the business. We're doing that through uh more robust
[00:29:12] digital marketing in terms of getting our name out there and connecting with customers uh interested in outsourcing
[00:29:18] or create and also creating interest in outsourcing. We're adding to our sales
[00:29:23] team and I mentioned we've been adding salespeople on the B2B verticals uh even
[00:29:28] since I joined four months ago. uh and we're going to be very focused on high
[00:29:34] growth markets like North America and high growth verticals uh where we are seeing a disproportionate level of
[00:29:40] growth in our pipeline uh on those B2B sectors. So uh with that um we we expect
[00:29:47] that organic growth will ramp. I would add that we're going to focus in those
[00:29:52] areas, North America especially the uh B2B market verticals especially in 2026.
[00:29:59] 2027 brings the opportunity for us to continue to dig in on our current business in Asia where we're really well
[00:30:06] positioned in Thailand, Malaysia, Singapore, uh a toe in the water in Australia. And that introduces a whole
[00:30:13] new TAM to our business in terms of organic growth that we can go after. We also have customers talking to us and
[00:30:19] interested in pulling us into the Middle East. Uh and we think in 2027 beyond uh
[00:30:25] we'll be ready for focus and uh attention to that theater. Uh that is
[00:30:30] another opportunity for TAM and our business all while our our teams continue to grow our presence in the
[00:30:38] consumerf facing sectors of e-commerce and retail and CPG and the markets of
[00:30:43] the UKI and Europe where we continue to see great growth opportunity.
[00:30:49] I would I would also say that uh a lot of what's happening in the world in terms of reshoring uh particularly
[00:30:54] infrastructure investments in Europe and so forth really plays well to to the capabilities uh that we've uh acquired
[00:31:01] through M&A over the past years and those B2B sectors where we have really strong capabilities. So we believe the
[00:31:08] market's coming to us in that uh that outsourcing makes a lot of sense for uh
[00:31:13] customers in that market uh and we're well positioned to execute against that. Love to hear Patrick, you mentioned
[00:31:19] getting your fair share. I hope you get an unfair share because your execution is so superior. Uh moving on, Patrick,
[00:31:26] in your comments in the at the third quarter results, you highlighted driving margin structurally higher as a key
[00:31:31] focus area for you. I I know you're currently integrating Wington, which should unlock some cost synergies for
[00:31:37] GXO, but can you talk through the levers uh that are at your disposal to drive margins structurally higher?
[00:31:44] Sure. Organic growth is my first priority. The margin expansion is a really close second.
[00:31:50] Okay. Respect to win Canton. Uh we we are on the path of capturing the M&A synergy
[00:31:56] opportunities there. We will achieve our goal of a 60 million run rate as we exit 2026. Uh about 10 to 12 million of that
[00:32:05] has already been captured and the actions in place to capture the balance.
[00:32:10] Um we are still seeing relatively flat volume plus or minus one or one one or
[00:32:15] two% from our customers and our growth plans and our margin expansion plans are
[00:32:21] not dependent on volume coming back from our customers but rather more through
[00:32:26] two key levers and that is organic growth which I talked about participation in the North American
[00:32:32] market which is which is a a healthy market from a profitability perspective
[00:32:37] as well as driving our presence in the B2B verticals which come with more
[00:32:42] complex supply chain solutions, higher risk and execution uh and therefore higher reward and profitability of the
[00:32:49] solutions that we sell in those areas. Uh so from a portfolio perspective on
[00:32:54] organic growth we expect a benefit on margin expansion and driving towards that. The other is uh on operational
[00:33:02] execution and our operational excellence agenda. I recently announced uh that we
[00:33:08] would be hiring uh and and have now identified an individual to be announced shortly as the global chief operating
[00:33:16] officer. That individual is focused on looking at our business through a global
[00:33:21] lens because I believe the level of M&A that the business has done over the last
[00:33:26] four years. The business at GXO has been run as uh regional silos really not
[00:33:33] looking yet at at the business from a global perspective and how we can leverage our scale in the best way possible. The new global COO is a big
[00:33:40] part of putting that global lens on the business in really two dimensions. One
[00:33:45] is from a labor productivity perspective making sure that we've deployed the best
[00:33:50] tools to drive the best productivity uh and the best underlying labor cost. doing that in a consistent way around
[00:33:57] what I would call the GXO way uh globally across our 1,200 plus operations and we believe there's uh
[00:34:04] labor savings opportunities there uh where we can benefit from margin expansion our customers can benefit from
[00:34:11] lower cost the second is around technology and we continue to be a leader in automation and warehouse
[00:34:17] robotics AI now humanoids um we are driving towards making sure that we're
[00:34:22] working with the right partners that the solutions that we're deploying deliver ROI and accelerating the pace in which
[00:34:28] we're getting these solutions into the hands of our customers to create value for them and to drive margin expansion
[00:34:34] in our business. And then finally from an SGNA perspective uh we we think we
[00:34:40] have the uh the teams in place in order to be successful uh and we continue to
[00:34:46] drive particularly looking through a global lens. Where can we leverage our global scale around procurement uh as an
[00:34:53] example to make sure that we get the best leverage of our SGNA uh for margin expansion as we go forward. We are
[00:35:00] planning uh an investor day in 2026, a date to be announced and we're going to share a lot of details uh on each of
[00:35:07] those pillars in terms of our path forward over the next three years. Well, it's great to hear that Patrick
[00:35:12] and you know you hear so much noise about AI is going to increase productivity and margins and humanoid
[00:35:18] robots and honestly the only company that I can see already doing it and already implementing this technology way
[00:35:25] ahead of the curve is GXO. So that's really really promising. Uh, switching gears to another value added service
[00:35:32] that GXO offers, I'd love to touch on reverse logistics and the long-term opportunity in that space. Uh, in
[00:35:39] traditional brick-andmortar retail, only about 1 in 10 items are typically returned, but that number jumps to
[00:35:45] nearly 1 in three for ecommerce. A lot of people don't know that. Uh, for retailers, outsourcing reverse logistics
[00:35:52] seems like a no-brainer. GXO has cited that roughly 96% of returns processed through its network
[00:35:59] are returned to stock compared with an industry average of about 25% of items
[00:36:05] uh ending up in landfills. So, not only is this an attractive opportunity from a
[00:36:10] cost-saving perspective for retailers, all you retailers listening into my call, you need to reach out to Patrick.
[00:36:17] Uh but it's also a lucrative higher margin segment for GXO with these
[00:36:22] contracts carrying significantly higher margins uh and revenue multipliers compared to standard contracts without
[00:36:28] these services. Could you first speak to how large you think this opportunity could become as e-commerce continues to
[00:36:36] expand its share of the overall retail pie? Uh why do you think more omni
[00:36:42] channel channel retailers haven't yet outsourced their reverse logistics given the clear cost and operational benefits?
[00:36:49] And finally, how should investors think about the margin profile of these contracts and their role in driving a
[00:36:55] structurally higher margin base for GXO over time? Sure. The the uh the third party
[00:37:04] logistics market for reverse logistics is really exciting. I think total addressable markets now about $60
[00:37:11] billion last I heard. It is a service that is embedded in what we do for
[00:37:16] customers today. Uh leveraging our process expertise. We've deployed AI in
[00:37:22] this area by the way as uh medium to try and capture the highest value for return
[00:37:27] products for our customers as they look to either return product to stock or put those product out to the resale market.
[00:37:35] We we acquired a really great business called Service Tech with the Clipper acquisition in which we're actually
[00:37:41] doing repair of iPads, cell phones. Um I've seen expensive Italian coffee
[00:37:48] machines being repaired. And that's all a great way in terms of how we're increasing the margins for our customer
[00:37:55] of the resale of those products and the capture of the value of product that is being returned. uh and we in turn are
[00:38:01] being rewarded with uh good margins on the provision of those services. One of the things that really excites me about
[00:38:08] this space is the competencies that we have in the retail and e-commerce space
[00:38:14] which we execute so well uh have high application in the B2B space and today
[00:38:21] we are managing cell phone returns at at a very high scale. Um a lot of
[00:38:26] regulation in Europe is uh is really driving uh customer interest in
[00:38:32] solutions for returns because of regulatory requirements that have to be met and that is going to be a real
[00:38:39] catalyst for growth and it's been fascinating to see in the data center work that we're doing where we are
[00:38:45] performing services in support of the sustainment and maintenance of data centers there is a lot of return product
[00:38:53] as a part of those services and we are applying the same competencies that we
[00:38:58] have for the retailers into the B2B space to make sure that uh those companies are capturing the greatest
[00:39:05] value with product that is being returned. I also think that we're playing a great role in terms of being
[00:39:13] responsible in processing product returns, doing the right thing for the environment, making sure that uh uh
[00:39:19] product that is disposed is disposed in the right way. Uh and that the value of
[00:39:24] product can be reclaimed even uh before product is disposed or destroyed. and
[00:39:30] especially driving towards product uh being preferenced to a resale market going forward either as a a new product
[00:39:37] going out or as a remanufactured or repaired product going out. So for us
[00:39:43] the the services around returns has such applicability to our customers. uh it
[00:39:49] creates real value for our customers in monetizing uh returns in a way that adds
[00:39:55] to their margins uh and a great way for us to grow our business uh with that as
[00:40:00] an embedded services as a part of uh our forward distribution services as well.
[00:40:06] That's great. Um one of the hallmarks of Brad Jacobs playbook and for we have a
[00:40:12] lot of institutional investors that listen and we also have a lot of ultra high net worth retail investors that
[00:40:17] listen. And so th those who don't know Brad Jacobs, all you need to know is he's one of the greatest wealth creators
[00:40:22] for shareholders in history between Waste Connection, uh, United Rentals and XPO. If you'd put 1 million bucks with
[00:40:29] those investments, you made 300 million, 300x if you aggregate all three of them.
[00:40:34] So he knows how to generate value for owners. Uh, and he's the chairman of your company. He's been leveraging
[00:40:41] technology and automation in traditionally uh outdated industries to
[00:40:46] win share. GXO is a prime example of that, leading the industry in automation
[00:40:51] with over 40% of revenue from automated operations and more than 1500 uh 15,000
[00:40:59] automated units and cobots already deployed across the network. We've long viewed GXO as one of the most
[00:41:06] underappreciated ways to play the broader automation and robotics theme. Where does GXO stand today relative to
[00:41:13] the rest of the industry? And how do you view automation as both a competitive differentiator and a key driver of
[00:41:21] scale? What are you seeing from customers in terms of interest and demand for automation within the sales
[00:41:27] pipeline? And uh lastly, as you continue moving uh toward more fully automated
[00:41:33] sites, how how should investors think about that margin uplift uh productivity
[00:41:39] improvements and customer stickiness that come with greater automation? And just as a dovetail uh on GXO Direct,
[00:41:47] which gives midsize customers access to the same technology and automation investments that would typically be out
[00:41:53] of reach, uh how would you describe that value proposition and how significant of
[00:41:58] an opportunity do you see for that platform as automation continues to scale across your customer base?
[00:42:05] Patrick, leadership starts at the top. Uh, GXO is
[00:42:10] a leader in technology and and I'm smiling based on your comments with Brad. Um, Brad Brad is always been a
[00:42:18] pioneer in technology. Technology features very high in all his businesses. Um, and even for himself
[00:42:24] when I'm when I'm interacting with Brad, uh, he is a prolific user of AI on his
[00:42:31] phone. Yeah. uh he he uses it in uh summarizing meetings that we've had, creating
[00:42:37] actions, doing research. It's amazing uh to see how he as an individual embraces
[00:42:43] new technology, plays with it, figures out how it can help him improve how he works every day. And I think that uh
[00:42:49] ethos makes its way throughout the GXO organization uh and I think is a big
[00:42:55] part of why we are positioned in a market lead as a market leader uh in tech innovation. And it has fascinated
[00:43:01] me for the 32 years that I've been in supply chain that the warehouse has somehow become a surprising driver of
[00:43:08] tech innovation and and really the test bed for technological innovation going forward. So we continue to embrace
[00:43:15] technology, robotics, automation, AI, uh humanoids, uh all inclusive in that uh
[00:43:22] as a key catalyst for how we create value within the supply chain, how we create value for our customers and
[00:43:28] certainly underpins our aspirations for uh further margin expansion and organic
[00:43:34] growth. There's a couple examples of that. GXO IQ is a new tool that we
[00:43:40] announced and launched in uh the third quarter of this year. It's the first AI native operating system designed
[00:43:47] specifically for supply chains. We've done that in partnership uh with Google.
[00:43:52] Um it's built with AI integrated at the core. It's not layered on top or middleware anything like that. Um and
[00:43:59] that is allowing our teams where we have deployed that to make millions of decisions in real time and orchestrate
[00:44:05] those decisions in really interesting ways. That is for us going to be the
[00:44:10] platform for how we deploy AI to our 1200 operations and where we see good
[00:44:15] things happening from an AI perspective that allows us to truly leverage our global scale around the deployment of
[00:44:21] that and we have seen great success uh with AI in terms of labor planning,
[00:44:27] production planning, uh slotting, picking uh and helping our operations be
[00:44:33] more efficient. We feel like that creates customer stickiness with having this uh ecosystem of technology that is
[00:44:41] integrated with proven ROI. Uh and I think it's going to inspire our customers to want to participate uh with
[00:44:48] us in uh journeys to deliver value in supply chain. In terms of customer
[00:44:54] stickiness, our contracts uh are longer when automation is employed. They're typically 10 years or longer compared to
[00:45:01] our average 5-year contract. margins are higher uh in the operations where we
[00:45:06] have deployed automation and uh our technology ecosystem in a great way. Um
[00:45:12] and that really goes with the margin expansion opportunity to accelerate the pace in which we're getting that into
[00:45:18] the hands of our customers uh and doing that in a way that uh we and our customers can share in the value uh that
[00:45:26] that is uh creating. And so we're really excited about the future that uh
[00:45:31] technology is bringing to us. Uh and we're really going to harness that uh on the two priorities organic growth and uh
[00:45:38] great operational execution margin expansion going forward. Super funny little anecdote to your
[00:45:44] point with Brad. I met met with him in person a couple months ago at the QXO offices and uh pretty much the first
[00:45:51] thing he does in the conference room he says to his phone uh tell me uh who is Tom Hayes uh Great Hill Capital and tell
[00:45:59] me more about his podcast Hedge Fund Tips with Tom Hayes. I'm like uh oh and it just goes on and on. Fortunately, it
[00:46:05] was all positive. So the meeting lasted an hour and a half. But if he had said we we don't know who he is, he would have been like uh security have him out
[00:46:12] out of here. But uh I saw him use it in real time. I was like, "Wow." Yeah. You were coming for my performance
[00:46:18] review. Yes. There you go. Uh well, staying with the technology theme, Patrick, a big part of
[00:46:24] our investment philosophy at Great Hill Capital has been focusing on the beneficiaries of AI, uh the everyday
[00:46:32] so-called boring companies quietly using AI to drive productivity and efficiency
[00:46:37] rather than the hyperscalers, what we call the cost centers, the ones spending all the money. uh building out the
[00:46:43] infrastructure. GXO is a perfect example. Earlier this year, you launched GXOIQ, the industry's first AI powered
[00:46:50] cloudnative operating system for logistics developed in partnership with Google Cloud. From pick path
[00:46:57] optimization that evaluates billions of variables per run to proactive replenishment that accounts for labor,
[00:47:03] inventory, and even weather, early pilots have shown a 22% productivity
[00:47:08] improvement across 30 sites. For those less familiar, could you walk us through what GXIQ does and how you see it
[00:47:15] scaling across your network and customer base? Uh what kind of feedback are you hearing from customers so far? And
[00:47:22] commercially, how do you view the long-term opportunity as customers adopt these AI capabilities more broadly
[00:47:28] across their operations? GXIQ is is the platform first and
[00:47:34] foremost that allows faster roll out of AI to our operations to get the benefits
[00:47:40] um rolling for our customers. You can imagine it as uh a warehouse
[00:47:45] management system in in the way that we have positioned it. uh it interfaces
[00:47:51] with our warehouse management systems and is really agnostic to the warehouse management system platform that we're
[00:47:56] running in a particular operation and it is effectively the store where our
[00:48:02] facility managers and teams can go and shop for the AI uh tools that can
[00:48:07] deliver value in their operation and create the greatest combination of AI tools uh to maximize the result. Uh and
[00:48:15] so by deploying GXO IQ, we've made AI
[00:48:21] accessible uh to the operations on the warehouse floor. We're able to measure
[00:48:26] the impact and result uh and return on investment associated with the AI modules so that we can make the right
[00:48:34] improvements to those have the impact of that hit the 1200 sites that are out there. um or maybe stop working with a
[00:48:41] tool that isn't delivering expected return and position something uh that is
[00:48:46] uh more improved and can deliver a better result. It's integrated with our
[00:48:51] data lake uh and and that is a big part of how it deres its value uh is being
[00:48:58] able to access a very large data lake associated with those operations that we run. Uh and so for customers who come on
[00:49:06] board with GXO uh as we start up for you uh you're plugged into GXO IQ just as a
[00:49:14] process of being integrated with us then it is really about making sure that we're driving the deployment uh of those
[00:49:21] AI tools and continue to drive continuous improvement in those AI tools
[00:49:26] going forward. So, as said, we we've deployed to about 30 sites uh so far uh
[00:49:32] with plans in place in 2026 to accelerate that deployment.
[00:49:37] That's great. Uh you know, Patrick, it it was nice to hear during the conference call that the the long- aaited Wington integration is now
[00:49:44] officially underway after a little hiccup there with the CMA. Uh and it's progressing well. So you've you've
[00:49:50] already mentioned your first joint customer win and remain on track to deliver the 60 million cost synergy run
[00:49:56] rate uh by the end of 2026 which is encouraging. Beyond that there's also meaningful revenue synergy potential as
[00:50:03] you leverage combined customer relationships across Europe particularly within the key industrial and aerospace
[00:50:09] and defense verticals. uh you have plenty of M&A experience under your belt overseeing uh four transactions over the
[00:50:16] past year alone at DHL. Uh with that context, what are your early impressions
[00:50:22] of Winkitin so far and how do you view the strategic fit within the GXO platform? Uh then in terms of revenue
[00:50:29] synergies looking back it took roughly 18 months for those from the Clipper acquisition to begin materializing
[00:50:36] uh ultimately helping uh to secure the landmark 2.5 billion NHS supply chain
[00:50:42] contract. What's your outlook for for realizing similar cross-selling or vert
[00:50:48] vertical expansion opportunities uh as the winken integration continues to
[00:50:53] progress? thing that comes to my mind on WCAN is the great people that have joined the
[00:50:59] GXO from the WCAN organization. We at uh I'm uh four or five months into GXO
[00:51:06] right now. One of the things that has struck me here as being really unique is is the performance culture at GXO. Uh I
[00:51:13] heard somebody recently refer to our team members as athletes which is I think a p perfect personification of the
[00:51:19] attitude that people come in to work with every day and I see that in the wind canon teams uh that are joining our
[00:51:27] GXO team and I think we're really really going to benefit uh from uh the contributions of those individuals. On
[00:51:34] the cost synergies as you mentioned we're on track for the 60 million run rate by the end of 2026.
[00:51:41] very exciting is the revenue synergies that are emerging uh as a result of the
[00:51:46] marriage. Windcan brought great expertise on especially the industrial and aerospace
[00:51:53] markets. Uh we are taking their leadership uh on a few very significant
[00:51:58] opportunities that we're pursuing both in aerospace and defense. uh and you can already see uh the quality of our
[00:52:07] solutions and the quality of our proposals improving uh with their leadership in that area. In the third
[00:52:12] quarter alone, we saw our aerospace pipeline increase 30% quarter on quarter. Uh and that really came with uh
[00:52:19] being able to unlock the uh the CMA restrictions and get the teams working together. uh and we're already seeing uh
[00:52:27] results in the pipeline of new opportunities uh from those uh revenue and solution synergies that we have. The
[00:52:34] average deal cycle time in the contract logistics industry is 6 to9 months. So, uh, the conversion of that pipeline, uh,
[00:52:41] will come in in the middle of 26 and we'll see that, uh, but for me, I'm
[00:52:46] super excited, uh, about the revenue synergies that come here and how that
[00:52:52] can underpin our organic growth priority as we're moving forward into 2026 and
[00:52:57] going forward. Sounds great. And, uh, and a last one here, Patrick. I I've heard you talk
[00:53:03] about the winning team at GXO. Uh after your first 100 days or so, tell me what
[00:53:08] what stands out about the people you have in place and the new people you hope to bring on in the future. Uh you
[00:53:16] know, you you could break news here and tell us the name of your COO. Uh you don't have to, but just generally
[00:53:22] speaking. Yeah, I'm I'm uh I won't I won't break uh news here. The announcement will be
[00:53:27] out shortly. Okay. that that person is uh in process and I am super excited. Uh it's an it's an
[00:53:34] industry veteran uh who has global experience and really going to bring a lot to our global agenda. As I mentioned
[00:53:40] at the beginning of the call uh the culture of the GXO organization is what
[00:53:45] attracted me most. I used the the term athlete. We refer to uh the folks within
[00:53:51] our organization as teammates. Um, I I think those are perfect personifications
[00:53:57] of the culture at GXO in terms of being performanceoriented,
[00:54:02] uh, teamoriented and goal driven. And it was really fascinating for me coming in because I
[00:54:09] think a lot of people say, yeah, it's a performance-oriented culture. Everybody wants achieve results. Uh, but I saw
[00:54:16] very early underlying behaviors uh, that I would attribute to high performing
[00:54:21] teams. And the one that resonates the most with me is feed a feedback culture.
[00:54:27] And it was really fun going through the interview process with Brad Jacobs, as you can imagine. Um, great questions
[00:54:35] from him. Uh, and the end of the interview concluded with feedback.
[00:54:40] Here's what I thought you did well. Here's where I thought you could have done better. Um, and I thought that was
[00:54:46] interesting. That sort of that sort of hit me in a different way being in that setting. But then when I came in and
[00:54:52] started working this environment, I saw that happening regularly in the meet in just meetings that people were having.
[00:54:58] If we were having a a management review meeting at the end of the meeting, uh there were me people putting compliments
[00:55:04] out to the room and and there were people putting uh constructive criticism uh out to the room. Uh and I think that
[00:55:11] is how teens become uh high performing and how you sustain high performance. And so the things that I've heard from
[00:55:19] the outside about the GXO culture, I have found to be real on the inside and it makes me so excited in terms of the
[00:55:27] agility that we can move with the speed uh in which we can work uh and and the
[00:55:32] the uh opportunity to align the 150,000 teammates at GXO around a common vision
[00:55:40] uh and priorities of organic growth, margin expansion, delivering great service for our customers and being a
[00:55:46] great place to work for our people uh is is infectious and I'm so excited to be
[00:55:52] here for that. Well, Patrick, this has been really really helpful to all the investors out
[00:55:58] there for sure. Uh before I bug your assistant to get me some of that beautiful GXO swag in the background. We
[00:56:04] see the the bag, the coffee mug, the whole thing. Uh just want to encourage people to listen in to the quarterly
[00:56:10] conference calls. go to the website, go to the investor relations, see all the documentation and and the plan because
[00:56:17] this is going to be a phenomenal story. And I think this is the the quintessential
[00:56:23] AI beneficiary and robotics theme moving forward. All these technologies applied
[00:56:29] in real time. GXO is ahead of the curve and the good days are just beginning. So with that said, I want to thank the CEO,
[00:56:36] Patrick Kellaher. Thank you so much. Thank you so much, Tom. I appreciate being here
[00:56:42] and we're back. Wasn't that incredible? Let's get on with the podcast.
[00:56:48] Here are the quote of the week from Ray Dallio. The biggest mistake investors make is to believe that what happened in
[00:56:53] the recent past is likely to persist. What happened in the recent past? Defensives and staples and healthcare
[00:57:00] didn't work. What's happening? They are turning the corner. Healthcare is one of the biggest performers since the last
[00:57:06] couple of months. That theme will persist and excel in 2026. Midterm
[00:57:12] election years are volatile. Defensives and healthcare and staples do best and
[00:57:17] dramatically outperform the S&P. You speaking to my clients are well and you
[00:57:24] uh the listeners who are not clients are well positioned for it. If you've been paying attention, want to thank everyone
[00:57:31] who's been buying the merch uh hedge fund tips. Uh, you know, look, we've
[00:57:36] been doing this for over 6 years for clients and non-clients alike. We've really been doing it for clients and
[00:57:42] allowing non-clients to listen in, many of whom have become clients. But some of you are never going to be able to become
[00:57:49] clients. I think if you learn the framework, you will be able to grow your account over a million and become a client. But either way, all we ask is if
[00:57:57] you're getting value and making money, please share the podcast with one or more of your friends who you care about
[00:58:03] this holiday season as we continue to grow. We'll continue to do this for clients and non-clients alike. And uh
[00:58:10] and go ahead and email to info@hedgefundtips.com a picture of you wearing the merch so we
[00:58:17] can add you to our uh hall of fame here. And we we got a few more this week. you
[00:58:24] can check it out and take advantage. Let's get down to the data uh for the week. China Internet versus US Internet
[00:58:31] uh software 12 month forward PE. They're just coming off the mat in China despite
[00:58:37] the stocks being up two and 3x. Uh we are super excited. This will persist in
[00:58:43] 2026 and beyond. largest cumulative losses before a young startup company's
[00:58:48] turn to profit compared with cash burn for OpenAI and Anthropic based on media
[00:58:54] reports. Uh so we've never seen a cash burn like this uh between uh Anthropic
[00:59:01] and Open AI. The last one we saw was Uber and that actually worked uh and
[00:59:06] Tesla looks tiny in comparison to what we're seeing with Open AI. So, it'll be interesting to see how that plays out,
[00:59:13] especially with Gemini 3 taking the lead and Quen, the Alibaba model, kicking
[00:59:18] butt. Uh, a lot of great stuff going on. Commodity 10-year rolling returns, highest since bonds versus bonds since
[00:59:26] 2008. We've been talking about the commodity opportunity. It's starting to play out.
[00:59:34] We're seeing it in our positions like Albamaro, like Comtock Resources, like
[00:59:42] National Oil Well, Varco. Super exciting times. Um AI adoption rates by corporate
[00:59:49] customers are slowing. We saw that by uh with Oracle last night. Uh we'll keep it
[00:59:57] PG s the bed on earnings. Uh you know, don't buy the hype, ladies and
[01:00:03] gentlemen. The AI stories are going to be the GXOs of the world, not the hyperscalers in at at the same scale.
[01:00:11] They will be spending. We will be benefiting. Low expectations consensus long-term growth forecast near a record
[01:00:19] low sell side analyst. Uh that's uh always same with consumer sentiment
[01:00:26] which is at a record low which is why we had to get in another discretionary
[01:00:32] stock before a year end with Papa John's. All my happy billionaire and
[01:00:38] centillionaire and decillionaire clients that got their Papa John's gift card are
[01:00:45] smiling so wide they could eat a banana sideways. Last year they got Vans
[01:00:50] sneakers. This year they got Papa John's. We try to give them something from the portfolio each year and help
[01:00:57] earnings power. Uh I had one uh smart alec send me an email. I hope we uh I
[01:01:04] hope we initiate a position in race which is the ticker for Ferrari. So next
[01:01:13] year my stock my stocking is filled a little bit more fully. Uh just enjoy
[01:01:20] your pizza. We'll talk about Ferrari in 2026. Uh credit metrics are improving.
[01:01:26] European equities tracking be toward best year versus the US since 2006. If
[01:01:32] you've been listening to this podcast, you were positioned for international
[01:01:37] and you crushed it this year outperforming the US having emerging markets having XUS share of hedge fund
[01:01:45] stock holdings in top quintile of beta. Uh natural gas prices sore amid LNG
[01:01:53] export boom. We love that com stock. Lithium's recovery is only just
[01:01:58] starting. UBS says I love UBS. I love all the pessimistic European banks. They're always pessimistic and they
[01:02:05] always get it after the fact. They couldn't sell it hard enough when the stock was at $58. This is our Albamaro
[01:02:14] position. Now that it's at $130, they're saying it's just getting started after a
[01:02:20] double plus. Amen. Hallelujah. Keep pitching it. So in another uh turn and
[01:02:27] we get to 3x and 3 and a halfx and 4x we can lay it off to all the people that
[01:02:33] you are getting excited at 200 bucks a share indexed return of consumer
[01:02:39] discretionary versus S&P 500. This is what we're talking about ladies and gentlemen why we had to get some
[01:02:45] discretionary. Everyone's getting out. We be getting in as they say in the uh
[01:02:51] neighborhood. So price changes for selective market classes. We're seeing
[01:02:58] uh car prices normalize. This was core to our Cooper standard thesis which is
[01:03:07] now benefiting looks like today. Even today up again up around $32.
[01:03:14] Those of you who have been with us um for some time, we initiated in May of
[01:03:21] 2022 and went live on the claim and countdown Fox Business. Uh our starting
[01:03:29] basis was $510. It's now at 32 going a lot higher and
[01:03:35] small caps start to take off midmon in December and tend to outperform through March. Uh and we think that Cooper will
[01:03:43] benefit from that trend as well in addition to incentives going up from the
[01:03:48] OEMs and affordability uh improving.
[01:03:55] Fed funds rate versus core PCE inflation tends to follow. Rates are coming down
[01:04:01] more. Uh there was news yesterday that Trump is actually interviewing Walsh.
[01:04:08] Uh, that would be a mistake in my opinion. Go with Hasset. Go with Waller. Go with Bowman. Uh, don't go with Wars.
[01:04:15] He has historically been a hawk, not a dove. He will say in his interview that
[01:04:20] he's a dove and then he will turn into a hawk. Not dissimilar to what we saw with Powell. Although Powell came out
[01:04:27] yesterday and I think Powell wants to go out like Seinfeld. He was uh uh very
[01:04:33] balanced yesterday. Did a good job. and he may in fact just pull off the soft landing if he gets another cut in before
[01:04:40] his exit, which is a coin flip. Uh he can salvage a really good legacy. So
[01:04:47] kudos to him and uh pat on the back if he pulls it off. Uh spread of 100 day
[01:04:54] trailing returns, that's growth minus the S&P uh
[01:05:00] IGB. So that got smashed uh just in the last
[01:05:05] few months. All the Momo stocks uh Trump is approving tiny cars to be built in America. You can be sure that
[01:05:14] Cooper Standard will provide tiny door ceiling, fluid transfer and uh uh
[01:05:22] systems for the cars. Tiny, large, you name it, we got it. Cooper Standard is
[01:05:28] going up. Opinion, not advice. Go to hedgefundtips.com and click on terms. Consult your psychic
[01:05:36] before doing anything uh from this podcast or otherwise.
[01:05:42] Bottom up S&P earnings estimates continue to go up. Double digit earnings growth for next year 13%. That is good.
[01:05:52] Small cap halfmon seasonality as we can see second half of December is the
[01:05:57] highest performance uh part of the year that will help some of our smaller cap
[01:06:03] positions the goose the Cooper standard the VF corpse uh that's not not quite a
[01:06:10] small cap the Varcos uh etc. So, even even Papa John's to a
[01:06:17] lesser extent, it's not a huge company. Here's consumer sentiment we've been talking about. This is why we had to get
[01:06:22] some discretionary and get some pizza on the plate in addition to our vans and our North Face and our Timberland and
[01:06:30] our um although Estee Lauder is not a discretionary, that is a staple. Women
[01:06:37] will give up lunch and dinner before they give up Mac Foundation or uh um
[01:06:46] Estee Lauder or um Dr. Chart or all the other incredible brands that Estee
[01:06:54] Lauder owns. Short interest for the median S&P 500, NASDAQ 100 and Russell 2000 stocks.
[01:07:01] Russell's has the highest short interest. We are going to see squeezy squeezy over the next few months. We
[01:07:06] love that. Uh Goldman Sachs equity sentiment indicator of investor
[01:07:11] positioning is just starting to turn upwards. Uh gas is set to power the bulk
[01:07:18] of new US data centers. Go comtock. It's your birthday. Zootopia 2 is now eyeing
[01:07:26] a 1.5 to 1.7 billion run rate at the
[01:07:31] worldwide box office. Oh, and by the way, AI beneficiary, not cost center. It
[01:07:37] only cost them $150 million to produce. AI beneficiaries versus AI cost centers
[01:07:45] all day long. The outlook for US GDP growth has improved.
[01:07:51] Discretionary investors are implicitly pricing in a sharp slowing in earnings growth. Good luck with that, ladies and
[01:07:58] gentlemen, because if the Supreme Court votes against the tariffs, not only will Trump find a way to keep the tariffs
[01:08:05] going in the intermediate term, but in the short term versus returning that
[01:08:10] money to the foreign countries, he will take that money and dividend it out as a
[01:08:16] check to US taxpayers. And I'm going to tell you that the people who received
[01:08:22] the $2,000 checks are going to be using it to buy Papa John's pizza and vans.
[01:08:31] So, that would be a great thing, not a bad thing. We'll see what happens on
[01:08:37] that front. But uh I have a sneaking suspicion between the increased tax
[01:08:43] refunds from the big beautiful bill fiscal impulse and potentially dividend
[01:08:49] checks discretionary is going to do a okay in 2026 especially from where we're
[01:08:57] buying it. Rolling one-year correlation between healthcare and NASDAQ excess returns versus equal weight S&P 500. You
[01:09:04] can see this extreme which is why we have the additional healthc care exposure with fizer and we have it
[01:09:12] positioned in a unique way that clients will see in their accounts uh so that even if the stock doesn't double over
[01:09:19] the next three years we will make a multibagger for clients which we love.
[01:09:25] Um, more S&P firms are raising earnings guidance. Here is small cap ETF flows.
[01:09:33] Russell on the verge of a breakout. Want to be paying attention to this.
[01:09:39] Uh, here is forward earnings per share. As you can see with tech and the hyperscalers, price has gotten well
[01:09:47] above earnings per share. Uh and when you get these type of uh divergences,
[01:09:55] the price tends to back up. Which is why we think indices are going to be subdued
[01:10:01] and volatile next year because of the dramatic waiting of the hyperscalers even as the groups that have
[01:10:09] underperformed defensives, staples, healthc care are going to outperform
[01:10:16] dramatically and lots of money will be made under the surface. it will not be seen in the indices. So, the passive
[01:10:23] indexers will be disappointed. The overweight tech people will be excessively disappointed. And the
[01:10:30] followers of hedge fund tips with Tom Hayes and clients at Great Hill Capital
[01:10:35] will be smiling so wide they could eat a banana sideways just like they were smiling so wide they could eat four
[01:10:42] bananas sideways in 2025. sector share of market cap. You can see
[01:10:49] it at 34%. So if it doesn't do well or consolidates the gains next year, the
[01:10:55] indices won't do well and consolidate the gains. But these other groups will start to pick up the materials. You're
[01:11:01] already seeing what a preview of what's to come with Albamaro. Uh REITs are
[01:11:06] going to start to outperform Crown Castle. Staples are going to start to outperform the Dagios, the Estee Lers of
[01:11:14] the world. And then you're going to see international continue to outperform with the weaker dollar aka
[01:11:23] Baba BU at L. And then beneficiaries of a weaker dollar like GXO who has tons of
[01:11:31] their earnings outside the US at present will benefit from that weaker dollar as
[01:11:36] those earnings are repatriated. uh annualized total outperformance by
[01:11:42] style during all bull markets since 1970. This is from Pollson small caps
[01:11:50] dramatically outperformed then cyclicals then global
[01:11:56] etc. So positioning is key liquidity indicators liquidity has come down.
[01:12:02] Guess what happened this week? Quantitative easing is back on. That was the beautiful surprise from Chairman
[01:12:10] Powell who wants a positive leg legacy. They are going back into the market to
[01:12:17] buy on the short end of the curve and calling it something other than QE. But
[01:12:24] we all know what it is and so did the market which is why the Dow was up some 500 points yesterday. number of $1
[01:12:32] billion plus deals that are IPOs versus private deals. Uh IPO is going to kick
[01:12:38] up in 2026. You're seeing SpaceX saying that they're going to go out at a trillion and a half. You're seeing Open
[01:12:45] AI saying that they want to go out. We'll see if they're they're in time. I'm sure they'll do okay because they'll
[01:12:50] control the supply and lay off a lot to retail
[01:12:56] and so on. Market implied Fed path. Fed says one next year, market says two or
[01:13:03] more. I think the market will be right. US auto manufacturers at 52- week highs.
[01:13:10] Auto related stocks are also rebounding. We love it. Um
[01:13:16] monetary conditions for most of the economy are still tight. So that is we are in an easing cycle. Dividend payers
[01:13:23] are going to dramatically benefit. Just look out through history. And you know that helps the Stanley's, that helps the
[01:13:31] Papa John's, that helps the Fizers, that helps um the Hormel's dividend
[01:13:37] aristocrat paying for 60 plus years uh and so on uh and so forth. So, moving
[01:13:47] right along, Wall Street forecast for 2026, Bank of America is the uh least bullish
[01:13:56] and Deutsche Bank, an European bank is the most bullish. That is something you
[01:14:03] don't see every day. Consumer staples relative to
[01:14:09] uh S&P uh all-time low. This is the time of
[01:14:16] your life to buy this. You haven't seen, by the way, this is how Warren Buffett had a few of his best years ever from
[01:14:23] 2000 to 2004 in terms of performance when the NASDAQ crashed 90%
[01:14:29] 80 90% names like Amazon etc. While those were crashing, Buffett had record
[01:14:35] performance because he was buying all these staples that no one wanted in 2000. And then as tech rolled over, he
[01:14:43] made money like crazy. Similar things will be in the future. I don't think
[01:14:49] we're going to see massive crashes in tech at all, but I do think we're going to see outperformance of these
[01:14:55] defensives and dividend payers in 2026.
[01:15:01] During the dotcom bubble, stock prices clearly decoupled from fundamentals, a phenomenon yet to be seen recently,
[01:15:07] although we did see it a little bit in the earlier chart. Forecast for US
[01:15:12] electrical demand are accelerating. We love that. Generact backlog for the data
[01:15:19] center generators is a half a bill and growing. Comtock resources is going to
[01:15:26] power this move. S&P 500 performance during the presidential soci cycle worst
[01:15:32] year is the midterm year for indices average max draw down is 17% average
[01:15:39] returns are low single digits what outperforms by 9% healthc care staples
[01:15:46] defensives dividend payers be prepared amigos and amigos
[01:15:53] most of the magnificent 7 are lagging the S&P 500 in 2025 five. You wouldn't
[01:15:58] see that in the headlines. What has been one of the top performing AI stocks is
[01:16:06] Intel has dramatically outperformed all AI stocks with the exclusion, I believe,
[01:16:12] of AMD, but that may no longer be the case, in which case Intel is the number
[01:16:17] one AI stock. And if you were watching Stuart Vanney in September of 2024 when
[01:16:24] we were pounding the table, literally he always makes fun of me for pounding his table on set
[01:16:30] at $18 and $19. You guys made coin and you should buy a
[01:16:36] hat and tell your friends and family about this incredible podcast. All right, moving along. Um, you can see ADP
[01:16:44] employment moving down. That's going to keep the Fed's pedal to the metal. M&A deals are picking up. There's still some
[01:16:51] animal spirits. Dow industrials four-year presidential cycle. We just finished this. We had that draw down,
[01:16:57] some strength into year end early and then weakness into the fall recovery and then 2027 is a rock your socks off. My
[01:17:06] guess is 2026 will be similar to 2022 in
[01:17:11] that we will be massive buyers of tech in the fall after everyone gets taken
[01:17:18] out behind the shed and shot. We will be picking up the remnants in the tech
[01:17:23] sector sometime in the fall of 2026 with all the money that we make from the healthcare defensives and dividend
[01:17:29] payers in the early part of the year. Here's the Ned Davis chart. If you are
[01:17:35] listening to this podcast, congratulations. Means you're probably exercising while you're doing it.
[01:17:40] Multitasking. Uh if you're getting value, you there's no question you are.
[01:17:45] If you watch it one of these times, you're going to get 10x the value. It's the difference between
[01:17:53] uh listening to a basketball game and actually being on the court and watching
[01:17:58] and experiencing it. It's a completely different game, especially with all these data charts.
[01:18:05] Uh here we go. Retail clients were the biggest net sellers last week. Well, they missed the
[01:18:11] rally after the Fed. That's unfortunate. Um
[01:18:17] every 1% savings in labor cost equals 2% upside in S&P 500 EPS. uh the
[01:18:24] productivity enhancements of the AIS and other tools coming to bear are going to
[01:18:30] increase margins for the beneficiaries decrease margins for the cost centers
[01:18:36] like hyperscalers Dow Jones transportation average versus the industrial average lot of opportunity in
[01:18:43] transports I'm waiting on UPS to replace the CEO I'm waiting uh well we have
[01:18:49] Boeing which has been great off the April lows uh we continue to Love that stock. A lot to do in the transports if
[01:18:57] you don't have any exposure. I think you could probably put GXO in that category.
[01:19:03] So, we've got enough exposure there.
[01:19:08] Uh, rule of 10 best days trying to time the market. Impact of not owning the 10
[01:19:14] best days trying to time the market. You would have since 1928.
[01:19:19] If you're in every day, you earn 8% per year uh or 14% since 2016. If you miss
[01:19:29] the 10 best days of the year, you lost
[01:19:35] 13% per year or 9% since 2016.
[01:19:42] Um, which is no bueno. So buy great companies, sit on your hands, ignore the
[01:19:48] noise, avoid the shiny objects, and you will compound your wealth massively over
[01:19:53] time. Dollar touches the lowest since October after Fed cuts rates. Uh
[01:20:00] utilities versus the S&P, these will do well uh next year as well as part of
[01:20:05] defensive groups. Just stay away from the ones that have already had a bid due to the AI story and are overvalued.
[01:20:15] uh November 2025, lot of launches, a lot of leverage launches. Those people are going to get
[01:20:21] taken out behind the woodshed and shot on the triple leverage stuff and they're
[01:20:27] all in the triple leverage uh shiny object funds. They're toast. They're going to absolutely get roasted in 2026.
[01:20:34] US dollar is following its historical road map. Uh those of you who have been around with us for a few years, we were
[01:20:39] calling for that when no one else was. That trend is uh going to persist for a
[01:20:46] few more years. Here's the average year returns, average
[01:20:52] midterm year. As you can see, there you go. You got to be in the ones that benefit from charts like this. Oracle
[01:21:00] credit risk cost double since October. Uh and they had bad earnings. S&P
[01:21:06] forward ratio subsequent 10-year annualized return. So, they're saying the um PE ratio implies sub more subdued
[01:21:14] returns. I'm not sure that's going to be the case. I I do think you're going to see the waiting of the hyperscalers
[01:21:20] start to reduce and some other groups pick up the baton to drive the overall indices through the end of the decade
[01:21:27] and early 2030s. Holiday spending update 2025 is exceeding the previous years.
[01:21:33] We'd like to see that December cut near all-time highs. Could have bulls smiling in 2026.
[01:21:40] Uh it would imply low double digit return. We'll see what happens on that front. Maybe after uh yeah, the year-
[01:21:46] end rally after the election. Uh operating profit margins now at record highs. Small caps just breaking out. No
[01:21:53] one's paying attention. This is going to be the theme for the next two years. If you don't have small cap exposure, you
[01:21:58] are asleep at the wheel. cumulative ETF flows by current cycle.
[01:22:05] Uh what else do we have here? Professional investors lightened up
[01:22:10] against ahead of the meeting yesterday. So sorry you missed it. Uh average
[01:22:15] annualized forward frequency
[01:22:21] economic qu. Okay. All right. So that's that. Let's move on to some of the headlines of the week. exclusive bite
[01:22:27] dance. Alibaba keen to order an Nvidia H200 chips after Trump greenlight. Sources say Meta reported to use
[01:22:33] Alibaba's Quinn for avocado model in likely win for China. Uh, US investors
[01:22:40] are going big on China AI despite concerns in Congress. That's Alibaba.
[01:22:45] The concerns in Congress are nonsense. At the end of the day, Trump is going to China in April. if he has some hiccups
[01:22:52] along the way where it's going to impact his handshake with Xihinping and his ability to declare victory, you'll have
[01:22:59] the Rick Scots of the world come out and do the D-listing again and they'll be wrong. Uh it's the only kind
[01:23:06] of arrow in their quiver when the Chinese are not cooperating. They threaten that and then everything gets
[01:23:12] back to the table and they move forward. It it's mutually assured destruction if they were ever to do that. So, they
[01:23:18] won't, but they'll threaten it. They'll get to the table and Xi will continue to slow walk for another two years and give
[01:23:24] as little as possible and uh and Trump will declare victory and that's the way it's going to go. China political bureau
[01:23:30] makes boosting domestic demand top goal in 2026. AI Alibaba is the toll taker
[01:23:36] for China consumption. Expect more great things there. China Hong Kong stocks set to gain nearly 20% in 2026. JP Morgan
[01:23:45] says opinion follows trends. These were the same group that was downgrading Alibaba in the hole at $60.58, calling
[01:23:53] it uninvestable. Now at 160, they're saying it's going higher. And they're
[01:23:58] actually going to be right uh this time. Uh they were completely wrong last time. And they'll and uh when it's at 250 300
[01:24:05] and they're pounding the table, we will be laying off all of our shares. Northbase skims to launch second winter

[01:24:56] that Airbus is now struggling and they're having mechanical problems. Boeing is soaring in a duopolistic

[01:26:08] sensitive to the price of the underlying commodity, which we think by the way is probably due for a bounce. Uh Stellena
[01:26:14] CEO says hybrids are a top priority for the US market. Why is that important? Cooper Standard makes more per vehicle
[01:26:22] cost per vehicle on hybrids than they do ICE. Our model uh is predicated on ICE
[01:26:29] which have the lowest cost per vehicle. Uh so we're very very conservative when when we think that Cooper Standard can
[01:26:35] earn 10 bucks a share at the top of the cycle two years out. Uh you put a 10 or 20 times multiple and that's where we
[01:26:42] think we can go. Um despite the six bagger already in the bag. Why home
[01:26:48] buyers see some hope in 2026? We agree. Disney making 1 billion

[01:27:14] US tech stocks may not be so exceptional in 2026. You already got tomorrow's newspaper

[01:27:55] don't think so. I think it's going to surprise a lot of people that the 10-year is going to get dramatically bid
[01:28:02] in 2026 as volatility picks up, Fed cuts happen. chair, Fed Chair Jerome Powell
[01:28:09] says, "US may be drastically overstating the jobs numbers. You keep believing that and keep cutting rates. We love
[01:28:16] it." Uh, here's from my buddy Jose Torres over at Interactive Brokers. The
[01:28:21] senior economist talking about the uh Fed cut. Fed the central bank has seen
[01:28:27] its balance sheets shrink to a significant 2.43 43 trillion since its peak in April 2022. And now judges that
[01:28:34] reserves at financial institutions have dropped to ample levels which justify acquisitions of tea bills to ease
[01:28:39] funding stress in the system. Usage of the Fed's repo facility has begun to trend much higher in recent months. An indication that banks have too much
[01:28:45] government debt on their books and not enough cash. A condition signaling the potential for scarce reserves in the near future against the backdrop of
[01:28:51] rising fiscal issuance and liabilities. is a reversal from quantitative tightening to the addition of new fixed
[01:28:56] income instruments is kind of like QE and is music to the ears of stock bills
[01:29:02] as it bolsters liquidity conditions and adds fuel to the fire of some of the most speculative areas in equities.
[01:29:09] Indeed, folks, the small cap cyclally oriented Russell 2000 has reached a fresh all-time record for the second day
[01:29:15] in a row and all the major domestic benchmarks are advancing on the session. Guild curve is plunging in bull's
[01:29:21] deepening fashion leading south by monetary policy sensitive front end while today's accommodative tilt is
[01:29:26] sending commodities north due to stronger growth projections. Amen. Hallelujah. QE is back. Small cap stocks
[01:29:34] may be ready to outperform after 5 years of lagging. Amen. Jacob Sun and Shine
[01:29:39] over at Barons. Hope you're doing well. Article of the week, holiday cards and auto parts.
[01:29:46] Oh, sorry. Holiday carts and auto parts, stock market and sentiment results. I
[01:29:52] think that's the best title that Jeff has done so far. Really good. I like the rhyming. Uh makes it easy to remember.
[01:30:00] Let's get down to advanced auto parts update. The AAP turnaround continues to
[01:30:06] gain traction, delivering its strongest quarterly performance in more than two years with comp store sales up 3% and
[01:30:12] adjusted operating margins reaching 4.4%, 4% up 368 basis points yearonear.
[01:30:18] The new CEO Shane O. Kelly who took the helm just over two years ago is proving to be exactly the caliber of lead
[01:30:25] leader. This strong long struggling business needed after years of mismanagement and false starts. While
[01:30:31] the market remains blinded by recency bias surrounding AAP's seemingly neverending multi-deade turnaround and
[01:30:38] maybe because aftermarket auto parts aren't as sexy as AI. That lack of glamour is exactly what creates the
[01:30:44] opportunity. What will be sexy is the operating leverage that gets unlocked as store level execution improves and
[01:30:52] supply chain efficiencies take hold, clearing the path for normalized earnings power that the market still
[01:30:57] refuses to give AAP credit for. Until then, we're happy to sit on our hands
[01:31:03] and wait as the turnaround unfolds. A few weeks ago, Okelly and CFO Ryan Grimsland gave an excellent highlevel
[01:31:10] update on the turnaround's progress and fielded investor questions at the Gabelli Fund's 49th annual automotive
[01:31:16] aftermarket symposium. For anyone wanting to understand the key levers being pulled and why we have such strong
[01:31:23] conviction in this management team, the discussion is well worth the time. We're
[01:31:28] not going to play it here because we already had the 45minute interview
[01:31:34] with Patrick Keller, but you should definitely listen. It's well worth a while. We've highlighted the key points
[01:31:40] in the earnings results as well as the conference call. You want to go to hedge fun.com and do that. But here are the 10
[01:31:47] key points. Advance delivered 2.04 04 billion in revenue, down 5%
[01:31:52] year-on-year, beating consensus by 13 million with the decline driven primarily by operating fewer stores
[01:31:59] after this year's footprint optimization that closed 700 underperforming
[01:32:04] locations, adjusted earnings of 92 cents, beat expectations by 18 cents, and compared to a loss of 5 cents in the
[01:32:10] same period last year, too. Comparable same store sales grew 3% for
[01:32:17] the quarter, landing at the high end of management's low singledigit guidance and accelerating from last quarters
[01:32:26] 10 basis points positive contributions from both the pro and DIY channels.
[01:32:32] Three, the pro channel delivered just over 4% comp growth in Q3, making it its
[01:32:38] fifth straight quarter of positive performance on a 2-year basis. Trends remain positive in Q4. So far with the
[01:32:44] new strategy gaining traction as store availability has improved to 96 to 97%
[01:32:49] from the prior low 90% range and time to serve has fallen by more than 10 minutes. The main street customer group
[01:32:56] the highest margin segment within pro still represents the single largest opportunity for the DIY channel
[01:33:02] delivered positive low singledigit comps during the quarter showing sequential improvement in transactions on both a
[01:33:08] one-year and two-year basis. Moving into Q4, management has seen more pressure on the consumer and some volatility in
[01:33:14] week-toeek transactions, but remains confident in the long-term outlook given the non-discretionary nature of the
[01:33:20] business with 90% of sales tied to repair and maintenance. Remember, the average car is 14 years old now. Five,
[01:33:26] the market hub strategy continued to progress with management now expecting to open 14 new market hubs this year
[01:33:32] compared to their prior expectations of only 10. They're still targeting 60 market hubs by mid2027 and expect to end
[01:33:39] the year at 33. These hubs carry 75 to 80,000 SKUs and provide same day parts
[01:33:45] availability to a service area of 60 to 90 stores which has driven a 100 basis
[01:33:50] point comp sales uplift to supported locations so far and creates incremental opportunities to gain market share.
[01:33:59] In addition, management expects to have 16 distribution centers by year end compared to 38 just two years ago, as
[01:34:06] well as open 30 new stores for the full year and still target at least 100 new
[01:34:11] openings over the next two years. 30 new stores and 100 new openings over the next two years. That is not a company in
[01:34:17] decline. That is a company that cleaned up a mess and is now back in growth mode. Expansion mode. Six. Advance has
[01:34:25] invested 50 million in store upgrades year to date, which include improved HVAC systems, roofing, parking lot,
[01:34:31] signage, and is more than double the total capex allocated to these projects last year. These upgrades cover more
[01:34:36] than 1400 store locations year-to- date compared to just 440 in 2024. Management
[01:34:41] expects capex to total 250 million for the year, lower than the prior 300 guidance due to timing shift into 2026.
[01:34:50] Seven, adjusted gross margins came in at 44.8%. 8% for the quarter, up 260 basis
[01:34:56] points from last year's 42.3. Adjusted operating margins, the most important metric in the AAP turnaround, came in at
[01:35:02] 4.4%, up 368 basis points year-on-year and the strongest quarterly performance
[01:35:08] in more than two years. Management remains confident in the 2027 target of 7% adjusted operating margins with
[01:35:15] street consensus still forecasting just 4.8% for 2027, a number we expect to move higher as it becomes obvious. Eight
[01:35:23] year-to- date free cash flow stands at an outflow of 277 million which includes 130 million of cash charges related to
[01:35:30] restructuring activities. Management expects fullear free cash flow to be an outl and 90 million and includes 150
[01:35:37] million of cash charges. Backing these out, AAP would have delivered positive free
[01:35:43] cash flow for the year, giving management confidence in the ability to generate positive free cash flow in 2026
[01:35:48] and beyond. Nine management narrowed and reaffirmed the midpoint of fullear guidance. Now expecting net sales at
[01:35:55] 8.55 to 8.6 compared billion compared to 8.4 to 8.6 which implies an upgrade of
[01:36:04] 750 million in sales. Comp sales growth is expected to be 7/10 of 1% to 1.3%
[01:36:13] and adjusted operating margin is projected to be between 2.4 and 2.6% 6% which implies more than 200 basis points
[01:36:20] of annual margin expansion in the first year of the turnaround plan. And 10 management views first brands as a
[01:36:27] one-off situation rather than a broader concern for the aftermarket industry. AAP currently sources less than 2% of
[01:36:33] cost of goods from the supplier with plenty of alternative options among the hundreds of vendors they already work
[01:36:38] with. Management recorded a non-cash charge of 28 million in cost of sales during the quarter to account for future
[01:36:44] credit losses on receivables from first brands and this will not affect fullear guidance.
[01:36:50] Earnings call highlights are highlighted. Go to hedge fun.com. While you're there, click on terms opinion
[01:36:56] advice. Moving on to Etsy update. As we can see, free cash flow is near all-time
[01:37:03] highs. Revenues are at all-time highs. Gross margins are at or near all-time
[01:37:10] highs. Uh priceto free cash flow multiple at or near all-time lows. And
[01:37:16] you can't give the stock away. We think that will change. And here is why. Here
[01:37:23] are the 10 key points from the most recent earnings call. Etsy delivered Q3 revenue of 687 678 million up 6.1%
[01:37:32] yearonear and ahead of Wall Street consensus by $21 million driven by a 12.7% increase in seller services
[01:37:39] revenue to 210 million while marketplace revenue declined 1.7 yearonear to 468
[01:37:45] million. ETS's take rate of 24.9% came in ahead of guidance, expanding 220 basis points year-on-year and 90 basis
[01:37:52] points sequentially. Two, consolidated GMS came in at 2.72 billion, up 9/10 of
[01:37:59] 1% yearonear and above the top end of management's prior 2.6 to 2.7 billion guidance range. ETS's marketplace GMS
[01:38:06] totaled four 2.43 billion ahead of expectations and down 2.4% yearonear but
[01:38:12] improving by 300 basis points sequentially. GMS per active buyer on a trailing 12-month basis was 121 down 1.6
[01:38:20] yearon-year percent but improving sequentially and continuing to show signs of stabilization. Three,
[01:38:28] continues to be a bright spot with gross merchandise sales of 992
[01:38:34] million. I'm sorry. Uh gross merchandise sales of
[01:38:40] 292.1 million, up 39.4% 4% year-on-year, a 400 basis points acceleration from
[01:38:46] last quarter, driven by 59% gross merchandise sales growth in the US. Deep depot active sellers climbed 40.8%
[01:38:53] year-onear to 3 million and active buyers rose to 38.8% to 6.6 million. Depot is now tracking
[01:39:01] toward annualized run rate of $1 billion plus and management continues to see significant opportunity to scale it into
[01:39:07] a multi-billion dollar asset, launching the brand's first ever campaign during the quarter to further raise US
[01:39:13] awareness. Four, earlier in the quarter, Etsy signed a partnership with OpenAI to become the first live partner within
[01:39:18] chat GPT's instant checkout. This gives Etsy an early foothold in the fast growing agentic commerce channel with
[01:39:25] initial results looking promising. Early data suggests these buyers have higher purchase intent than traditional search,
[01:39:31] driving higher conversion rates and a noticeable spike in purchases from this traffic, albeit off a small base. Five,
[01:39:38] ETS's app now accounts for 46% of total gross merchandise sales, up from 42.8%
[01:39:45] last year with app-based GMS growing 5% year-on-year and outperforming non-app GMS by 13 percentage points. The app
[01:39:52] continues to drive higher engagement and purchase frequency with app users generating 5x more visits, viewing 3x
[01:39:58] more pages per visit, and being 1.5x more likely to convert. Six, consolidated adjusted ebida margins came
[01:40:05] in at 24.5.4% for the quarter, in line with management's prior 25% guidance, but
[01:40:10] below last year's 27.7%. The margin pressure is primarily tied to increased marketing investment at depot. While the
[01:40:19] Etsy marketplace continues to post margins just shy of 30%, consolidated marketing spend increased 6%
[01:40:24] year-on-year to 208 million or 30.7% of revenue and is expected to remain
[01:40:30] elevated into the first half of 2026. 7 management repurchased 2.1 million
[01:40:36] shares during the quarter for a total of 120 million at an average price of 5714. Over the past 3 years, Etsy has reduced
[01:40:42] its share count by 21.5% through 2.47 billion in buybacks, making
[01:40:50] our slice of the pie that much bigger without putting up any additional capital. The current repurchase program
[01:40:55] still has 356 million remaining, 6.6% of the total market cap, leaving plenty of
[01:41:01] dry powder for continued to buybacks, supported by 1.6 billion of cash on the
[01:41:06] balance sheet. Look at these repurchases. It's through the roof and
[01:41:11] shares outstanding down 21%. Eight. Etsy announced that longtime CEO Josh
[01:41:18] Silverman will step down after more than eight years and transition to executive chair through the end of 2026. Cruy
[01:41:25] Patel Goyal will assume the CEO role at the start of 2026. She has been with Etsy for more than 15 years, spent two
[01:41:31] years as Depop CEO, where all the growth is, where GMS and the buyer base nearly
[01:41:36] doubled, and most recently served as ETS's president and chief growth officer. Nine, Etsy generated 205
[01:41:44] million in free cash flow during the quarter, bringing trailing 12 months free cash flow to 635 million, 12% of
[01:41:50] market cap, and converting 83% of adjusted EBID into free cash flow. and 10 management guided Q4 GMS to 3.5 to
[01:41:59] 3.65 billion with the midpoint implying further sequential improvement in the combined Etsy marketplace and depot
[01:42:05] year-on-year growth rate despite an uncertain consumer backdrop. The Q4 take
[01:42:10] rate is expected to be 24.5% with adjusted EBA margins under pressure at 24% driven primarily by the significant
[01:42:17] sequential increase in depot brand marketing during the holiday season. Here is the earnings call. We've
[01:42:23] highlighted the key important parts. You can find it at hedge funfundtips.com. And finally, market uh fear and greed at
[01:42:30] 31. Still a lot of fear as the market breaks to new highs. And um active
[01:42:36] managers starting to get exposure. Technology earnings estimates and revisions up 3% in the 3 and a half% in
[01:42:43] the last 60 days. and communication services down 1.18%
[01:42:51] uh led by meta economic data. The name of the game was the Fed cut this week.
[01:42:58] The rest is noise. You can see initial jobless claims came in higher than
[01:43:04] expected today. So it uh shows the Fed is on track for more cuts. Uh earnings
[01:43:10] growth for 2026 as we can see is continues to go up now at 309 up from
[01:43:18] 305. So that's a positive. And now we will get to our favorite section of the

[01:43:58] I've recommended your podcast to two colleagues recently. Thank you very much. My question is, what's your opinion on Laness?
[01:44:04] It's a German chemicals company. All right. L A N X E SS.
[01:44:15] Okay. Let's take a look.
[01:44:34] Revenues and free cash flow are headed in the wrong direction, hence the stock.
[01:44:39] Margins are starting to improve. Looks like the business has been deteriorating for a while. Uh
[01:44:47] let's take a look at financial analysis here.
[01:44:52] Find me some
[01:44:58] balance sheet maybe. There we go. Let's take a look at that first. See if you've got enough time to wait out any
[01:45:04] turnaround on this name. You're going to have to find out what's the management's plan to turn it around because see, so
[01:45:11] they got 400 million of cash, half a billion of receivables, debt is 2.8 probably. Okay. Okay, free
[01:45:18] cash flow is 135.
[01:45:25] Let's take a look at income.
[01:45:35] Take a look at quarterly. See what's happening there.
[01:45:42] Seems like it's trying to recover a little bit.
[01:45:53] kept the share count pretty steady. I look I think it's worth doing some
[01:45:59] more work on. Um it wouldn't be my f first choice in the uh chemicals area,
[01:46:04] but I think you're on to something. So go listen to the last eight calls, understand the turnaround plan. What did
[01:46:11] they say they were going to do? What have they done? What's the catalyst for change? And I think you might have something there. Eric C, I do not
[01:46:19] know how people complain about your podcast being long. Most don't. The losers do, but it is what it is. I
[01:46:26] believe they are too short. I have started listening to the same
[01:46:31] episode multiple times a week. What's your opinion on General Mills? Obviously, you've been listening because you are picking defensives for 2026 and
[01:46:39] you're going to make money. Congratulations. By the way, I always tell people, first off, the podcast
[01:46:45] itself is only an hour. It's the AMA. I take the time to answer the client question, the uh client and listener
[01:46:50] questions. That takes another hour. So, um you could just listen to the podcast part number one. And I said, listen,
[01:46:56] just listen. You know, if two hours is too long, just listen to 10% and you'll get 10% of the value. What else do you
[01:47:02] want to tell me? You know, I'm going to give the value where people want it. And uh uh but as far as General Mills goes,
[01:47:09] let's go here. G I S.
[01:47:20] You know, there was a story in the Bible complaining on the way to the promised land. Trip cancelled. Okay. God could
[01:47:26] only take so much. Complaining on the way to the promised land. Just cancel the trip. All right. Uh let's see. So
[01:47:33] revenues and free cash flow have been under pressure. So, the stock is down uh about 50%.
[01:47:40] I think you're got no problems here buying this. Let's see here.
[01:47:48] Subdued multiple dividend yield. I mean, this this strikes it on all fronts. I don't think
[01:47:55] you're going to get hurt with this. Uh so, go for it. I I look, if you can get
[01:48:00] it at $40, great. But 45, buy some now. Buy some more at 40 and then just hang
[01:48:06] on to it for a few years. I think you're going to be fine. I love it, Eric. And you're making money because you're
[01:48:11] listening to the whole thing. All right. So, here's KD talking about, "Please put race in the portfolio next year so you
[01:48:18] can send me a Ferrari instead of a pizza gift card." Uh,
[01:48:28] uh, he's asking about 529 programs. Uh, anything that you can do that's tax sheltered, you always want to maximize.
[01:48:34] So, the answer is yes. River Rah, uh, love the podcast. Share it with everyone
[01:48:40] else. Listen, I love it. Check out WFG. It's a housing play. WFG.
[01:48:50] WFG. Timber Company. Yeah, someone else sent another one of those in. These are hard
[01:48:56] to value. Uh, but I think you guys are both on to
[01:49:02] something.
[01:49:10] Yeah, I think the other one uh we're going to cover another one that I like better. By the way,
[01:49:17] I don't I don't love this one yet. I think you're getting close. There's another one that I think is going to
[01:49:22] come up in the questions that you're going to like. Uh, mills have been closing volumes
[01:49:27] returned. Beneficiary due to ample liquidity reminds me of Albamaro. I think you're right. You could buy it
[01:49:33] here. I think there's a better play. And I just forget the name off the top of my head. What do you think of this is from Veronica Winters. What do you think of
[01:49:39] AMCR MCO? Yeah, this has been a compounder.
[01:49:46] Uh, I like it. it. You know, we're not going to make a double on this, and
[01:49:51] that's kind of a requirement for us to commit any capital, but I think you're going to make money over time. This has been a long-term uh compounder. Let's
[01:49:59] just make sure it still is. Yeah, I I think you're generally okay on
[01:50:04] this, Veronica. You know, do some work on it. Listen to the calls. But I like it. Gleb Siticov
[01:50:13] Tom, I love the onpoint call for a healthy dip in November. Just wondering what are your thoughts on Zoetas? I hate
[01:50:20] the animal stuff because it just never works. It works on paper and it just the
[01:50:27] stocks tend to not work. I don't know why. So instead of getting horse pills,
[01:50:34] get pills for humans who look like horses that start with a G and end with a P. And I think you'll be much better
[01:50:41] off than Zoetus. Moving along. York bourgeoa, hope you've been doing
[01:50:48] well, blah blah blah blah. Uh, how did you predict that 10-year
[01:50:54] yield was going below five and you were calling for a three handle? How'd you have that? Uh,
[01:51:00] we covered that on the commitment to traders data. Everyone was positioned on one side of the boat. Uh, and that's
[01:51:06] that. Uh, fixed income blah blah blah.
[01:51:12] Yeah, York. Uh, go to the hedge fund tips channel, put in University of Bristol. I spent two hours with some
[01:51:19] students there. Explain to them what they should do in your shoes. I think you'll get value. Uh, it's not another
[01:51:26] week without a question about Ferve from Ken W. Um,
[01:51:36] it's probably time to buy some of this. I'm not going to, but I'd like PayPal.
[01:51:43] But let's take a look at this thing.
[01:51:50] Uh, financial analysis.
[01:52:02] All right. Ferve thing's trading like it's uh going out of business.
[01:52:09] Doesn't seem like it is though. Uh $27 billion of debt. So that's what
[01:52:15] people are worried about. Let's see what the free cash flow is. 7 billion. Nope, that's not that's not
[01:52:22] free cash flow. 4.6 billion. Uh income statement.
[01:52:34] I think you can do it. I mean, it's not going to be a position for us, but I think you're okay there. Lucy J,
[01:52:47] uh, asking about Generrack. I think they're being conservative, not the other way around. Felipe Andrew Pinkos.
[01:52:57] Okay, he's talking about the the patent cliff which we talked about offset by the new pipeline, offset by the new
[01:53:04] acquisitions, offset by the current valuation relative to history,
[01:53:09] um um etc. So, uh this is a no-brainer. We
[01:53:15] love Fizer. We positioned it in a way for clients that is uh unconventional so
[01:53:20] that they can make a multibagger off a very small move in the stock over the next two or three years. Um but um it
[01:53:28] will go up nonetheless in our view. Jose Quervo, are you concerned about Dagio's debt? Um
[01:53:36] no. So Dagio, this is a premiumization story.
[01:53:43] Um, by the way, you always get these stupid questions when the stock is down on the day. It obviously came in
[01:53:48] yesterday when the stock was down. Um, but let's just answer the question. And
[01:53:59] so, Dagio is generating 2.7 billion of free cash flow. Uh, there's certainly
[01:54:05] some leverage. It's a valid concern, but this is one of the best in class and it
[01:54:10] will benefit from treat people drinking less and drinking better. Um, so here is
[01:54:18] the free cash flow 2.7 billion steady as she goes. Balance sheet 2.6 billion, 3.7
[01:54:26] billion receivables and uh long-term debt at 21. Uh, you
[01:54:32] know, we understand the cap table. We understand how much cash they generate. We understand the the value of the
[01:54:38] brands. They could always sell off one or two brands if they had to. They won't have to, but they might do it to be to
[01:54:44] benefit. And we also
[01:54:49] like to see despite I mean this is kind of amazing when you think about it because drinking was at its peak in 2022
[01:54:57] during COVID and the revenues are still holding in there and um let's take a
[01:55:03] look at a quarterly basis reacelerating dramatic. Well, hold on
[01:55:10] for a second.
[01:55:19] reasonably solid there. And then let's take a look here.
[01:55:31] Share count been going down. We like this. Look, you got to have a play in
[01:55:37] the um alcohol business. It's a it's a massive overshoot. people still drink.
[01:55:43] They're gonna drink I I don't want the mass market stuff because people that are overweight probably drink a ton of
[01:55:49] beer and the cheaper stuff and now that they're on GLPs, they're drinking less. But the high-end premiumization, they're
[01:55:56] going to drink less. They're going to drink better. Dagio's perfectly positioned. It was mismanaged. Now they
[01:56:01] have an adult in the room. Uh we love this story and uh we're sticking to it.
[01:56:06] Jose Tim D. Oh, of course. Yesterday we got two
[01:56:12] questions on Dagio because the stock was down. Um, Lucas Tangrove,
[01:56:19] what do you think of Hunts? H, that's Huntsman's company Chemicals. I think I
[01:56:25] like it. Let me just take a quick look and confirm that. Yeah, I've looked at this one and I do like it. I think a lot
[01:56:33] of opportunity in the chemical companies. Okay,
[01:56:40] there we go. That family will turn it around. They
[01:56:45] know how to run the business. Look, it's I mean, there's no imminent sign of a
[01:56:51] turnaround. So, I would definitely get on the calls before you do anything, but they will fix it when the cycle turns.
[01:56:57] They have the operating leverage. I think it's a good company, uh, run by a good group, and you're going to make
[01:57:02] some money off of that for sure. let's just make sure that the balance sheet is not going to smoke you in the meantime.
[01:57:09] And the answer is no. They've paid down a bunch of debt and they still are generating ample
[01:57:17] free cash flow. So, uh, like that one. Good job, Lucas. On to the next. Matthew
[01:57:22] Tumbo. Uh, how do you approach tax loss harving?
[01:57:28] This is uh this is tax loss. Haring harvesting is for gamblers that think
[01:57:34] they can time the market. We covered the um
[01:57:40] we covered if you're out the the best 10 days and often times you sell in the
[01:57:45] first two weeks of December to tax loss harvest when everyone else is selling. And what happens to all those losers is
[01:57:51] they get bid huge uh at the end of December and the first two weeks of January, which you can't replace in
[01:57:58] inside of the 30 days for wash sale rules. So bottom line is if you're a
[01:58:04] gambler and like, oh, my trading thing went wrong and therefore I'm going to take my losses and and like try to
[01:58:09] pretend that it's a win because you screwed up. Uh have at it. But if you're owning a piece of the business and
[01:58:16] you're going to gamble that you can get out for 30 days, take the tax benefit and get back in 30 days from now, I
[01:58:22] mean, good luck with that nonsense. At the end of the day, own the business and sell it when it's fully valued and call
[01:58:28] it a day. Like, uh, I know that your typical financial
[01:58:35] advisor is going to say, "This is the value ad we provide. We're gonna harvest all your losses." How about not having
[01:58:40] massive losses? how why don't you try that? Um, you know, and um my suggestion
[01:58:47] is don't have a ton of losses and if you have a company that's taking longer to realize full value, just sit on your
[01:58:54] hands and wait. Stop trying to be so cute about everything all the time to save a few pennies on taxes. Every time
[01:59:00] I've ever waited till January to take the taxes into the next year or done tax
[01:59:06] loss harvesting, it always backfires. either the stock tanks because everyone was doing it, waiting till January 1st
[01:59:12] to sell the big winner or uh I sell it in the hole in December and it runs away
[01:59:18] by mid January and I missed 10 15% of the move. It's never worth it. Uh if
[01:59:23] you're underwriting these businesses properly, if you're trading and gambling, yeah, take all your losses. I'm sure you have plenty of them. Alex
[01:59:30] Trick, uh just discovered the podcast a few weeks ago. Already a big fan. I love
[01:59:35] that. added your pod to a weekly finance call with a friend to discuss and learn from. Curious about your take on DGXX.
[01:59:46] Uh, Digit Power Inc. Well, welcome. Um, you are probably
[01:59:53] early in the learning curve. I would go back and listen to a bunch of other episodes so you can start to learn the
[01:59:58] framework a little bit better. But, uh, this is still negative free cash flow. We're not interested in those type of
[02:00:03] businesses. But um appreciate you sending it. Uh yeah, this is data
[02:00:09] center. This is this is short-term shiny object stuff. It might work, but it's gambling and we don't do that here. So,
[02:00:17] um keep listening in. You're going to learn a ton. And then if you still want to play these spec plays, uh shiny
[02:00:22] object theme plays, flavor of the month, Wall Street fashion show stuff, you can do that with a small amount of your
[02:00:28] gambling money. But the investing money, buying pieces of great businesses at good businesses at great prices, that's
[02:00:35] what we do. Uh, good businesses at great prices versus great businesses at good prices. When Buffett had his greatest
[02:00:41] performance of his career, when he was running the partnerships, he bought good businesses at great prices. When he had
[02:00:47] free float from the insurance companies and a permanent capital vehicle, he started buying great businesses at good
[02:00:52] prices because he had a lot more money to put to work. But the performance suffered over the long term uh relative
[02:00:59] to when he was buying good business at great prices. So on the one hand, Charlie quote unquote educated him. On
[02:01:04] the other hand, Charlie led to his underperformance. Uh but also the law of large numbers impacted that as well.
[02:01:11] Paul Smith, I got that. Thank you for that. Uh
[02:01:19] Cameron Hector, I'd love your take on buy now pay later.
[02:01:24] blah blah blah. Uh yeah, look, Cameron, uh let's see. Uh source of
[02:01:30] potential consumer leverage analogist on a smaller mortgage buildup. Okay, it's not going to get anywhere near the
[02:01:36] mortgage build buildup. Uh but it is going to get flushed at some point. So, how's your view shape the way you think
[02:01:42] about consumer discretionary stocks that lean on buy now pay later? Uh PayPal specifically, I've been a listener since
[02:01:47] the COVID lows. You've helped my account significantly and made investing feel
[02:01:53] both fun and peaceful at the same time. Thank you, Cameron. Well, Cameron, you are a longtime listener, first- time
[02:01:59] caller. Thank you for being around that long. Glad your account is up big. Um, I
[02:02:05] hate buy now pay later. I think it's a uh crappy product that works until it
[02:02:11] doesn't. and um it's small enough in the scheme of PayPal that it will be
[02:02:17] beneficial in the long term. They did a good job of selling off a lot of their portfolio. So, I hope they continue to
[02:02:24] initiate it and sell it off to suckers because sooner or later the chickens come home to roost. It's a lowquality
[02:02:31] business, but it's high growth when it works and it's high margin when it works. just lay it off like all the
[02:02:38] smart people did during the housing crisis is they would originate and lay
[02:02:43] off to suckers and hopefully PayPal will do the same as they have been so far.
[02:02:50] Adam F question on PayPal. Same thing. I can tell you that I can
[02:02:57] look at a chart of PayPal and Dagio and if it was read that day, we'll have
[02:03:02] three AMAs on PayPal and Dagio and it's perfect metaphor for the psychology of
[02:03:11] an investor looking at day-to-day ticks. Why would your view of a stock or a
[02:03:16] company ownership change just because it is a red tick on that day versus when
[02:03:22] it's a green trick? If I if the stock shot up to $80, we'd have no questions on PayPal and um and we'll have even
[02:03:30] less questions when it shoots to 150 and these poor folks had sold it at 61.
[02:03:36] Joseph Oberilk, longtime listener and I share the podcast with everyone I can. Thank you
[02:03:42] very much. Thanks for the amazing content. genuinely look forward to your videos each week. Booze Allen Hamilton.
[02:03:47] This is a consulting play. I don't really like these businesses. Uh I think they're at further uh concern with the
[02:03:56] um advent of AI. A lot of this stuff can be done without them. This is a broken
[02:04:02] Momo stock. And uh you know, if I owned
[02:04:07] it, would I be selling here? Probably not. But would I be encouraged to be a buyer here? The answer is no. Uh Tom F.
[02:04:17] Blooming Brands
[02:04:23] turn around. Yeah, I looked at this one. We ultimately passed on it uh for uh
[02:04:30] Papa John's. Uh but I think you'll probably be okay
[02:04:36] here. I uh let me just try to understand. Let me take a look at the balance sheet.
[02:04:49] I think the whole group is going to be good in 2026, which is counterintuitive
[02:04:57] annual.
[02:05:03] So, I got 100 million of free cash flow.
[02:05:16] share accounts come down balance sheet.
[02:05:22] That's your issue? 250 million and then they've got how much debt?
[02:05:32] Well, they paid down the debt a little bit. I think it's a levered play. I think the
[02:05:38] other aspect was I just think their product is Let's see. Blue and Brands.
[02:05:44] No, Bonefish Grill. Yeah, I think you're okay. I think you're okay here. I kind
[02:05:50] of like this one. It was just a little too risky for me, but um when the group
[02:05:56] works, you'll probably have a threeagger and I'll have a two bagger. So, you may
[02:06:04] win on this, but you have a lot more risk than I do at Papa John's. So, there's that. Charlie Baker,
[02:06:13] uh, Christmas coming soon. Ben, best Christmas wishes. Hope all your wishes
[02:06:18] come true. You're saying for many people. Thank you. Uh, evaluate UHT,
[02:06:27] Universal Health Realy Income Trust. Uh yeah, I hate the medical property
[02:06:34] reats because they always seem to screw up something. Uh I just avoid them. I
[02:06:42] I'm telling you, if you're going to have negative surprises in the REIT space, it's always going to be in the medical
[02:06:47] property reats. I just avoid them as a rule. I would suggest you do the same.
[02:06:52] And you know, the difference between you and me is when God was handing out FOMO jeans, he didn't give it to me. So if uh
[02:06:58] doubles over the next six months, I don't give a like it doesn't bother me in one way whatsoever that I
[02:07:03] missed it because the down number one is don't rule number one don't lose money rule number two don't forget rule number
[02:07:09] one and these medical properties they always figure out a way to screw it up so Bill C
[02:07:16] ETF PSC we don't do a lot on ETFs um PSC
[02:07:25] small cap healthcare yeah why not I'd rather pick companies. Noah L,
[02:07:32] big fan of the podcast. Share it with my family and friends. Thank you very much.
[02:07:38] I know you already picked out Fizer. Was wondering you could look at AKBA.
[02:07:48] I'll bet there's a lot of dilution in this stock without even looking at it.
[02:07:55] Ah, it's a biotech. We don't do individual biotechs. Our our biotech basket has been a home run by the way.
[02:08:01] Still free cash flow negative. Let me just see how piggy this
[02:08:06] management has been. Uh
[02:08:15] yeah, there's a place in hell reserved for management that does this to their owners. So they've increased the share
[02:08:20] count from 118 million to 245. Uh no thank you. on to the next. Uh,
[02:08:28] Matt J.
[02:08:40] Okay. Matt says, "Been watching for over five years and haven't missed even one minute. Until this week, I was not sure
[02:08:47] whether your everinccreasing use of frank speech and slightly stronger language was improving the content. But
[02:08:53] then you said, quote, "I wish PayPal would go to 49 so we could get all the whiny little out of this stock."
[02:08:59] End quote. This week is in the most sincere of tones. And that this did it for me. Amen. Preach, brother. Thank you
[02:09:06] for continuing to tell it like it is. Sharing your expert insight and strong reactions in whatever language works
[02:09:12] best. This is what makes the pod great. Thank you for continuing to put out this exceptional content from the heart.
[02:09:17] Happy holidays to you and your family, Matt J. Thanks, my man. I appreciate that.
[02:09:23] Um, yeah, we'll call this one PG-13. All right. Brent Lamour.
[02:09:32] Uh, uh, he's asking about Weeble because they're trading
[02:09:39] they're changing the day trader rule to 2,000 instead of 25,000 so more people
[02:09:45] can gamble away the little money they have. Um. Uh,
[02:09:50] Weeble.
[02:09:56] Yeah. I not for me. I I don't like it. I No. Chris, it's like benefiting from
[02:10:03] people doing heroin. It's like not for me. Chris Williamson, do can you I said
[02:10:09] the guy who owns Dagio, but okay. I understand the hypocrisy. Can you do a brief look at Marquetta, ticker MQ?
[02:10:23] Okay. MQ
[02:10:38] uh cloud-based open API platform for card issuing. Yeah, the problem is it it
[02:10:44] does look okay, but um
[02:10:51] what is their moat? It's crowded. I I'd just rather play a
[02:10:57] sureer thing, which is the case with PayPal if I'm going to be in the space at all. Um
[02:11:05] they have scale, they have cash flow. Just see what's going on here.
[02:11:21] Look at this stock compensation. What a bunch of animals. All right. And the share count. Increase
[02:11:27] the share count from 100 million to 500 million. Even if their business works, they're going to f you. So dump it on
[02:11:34] their heads. Let them have it themselves and dilute themselves till the cows come home. Giant Patel listening for six
[02:11:40] months. Got to know about you from your interview in Cooper Standard website.
[02:11:45] Uh what are your thoughts on Crocs? I don't like Crocs. I don't even know
[02:11:51] why they exist other than for chefs and swimmers. Um and uh not for me. Hard
[02:11:58] pass. Buy Nike. If you're not going to buy VFC Corp, buy Nike. Jagar Kapadia,
[02:12:05] listen to your podcast for more than a year. Thank you very much. HelloFresh uh HFG
[02:12:23] Hello Group. Let's see. HFG
[02:12:39] I don't know. Those revenues are not showing any signs of recovering yet. Meal kit provider. No, forget that
[02:12:45] stuff. That's co. Skip it. Mias Hambook.
[02:12:52] Whirlpool. We keep looking at Whirlpool. Um, it's a play on rates and the housing
[02:12:58] market. So, probably, but we've not seen any signs of turning the corner yet. I
[02:13:04] mean, revenues have just collapsed.
[02:13:11] I mean, the numbers are so bad on this stock that like I I I almost think that their product has gone to crap.
[02:13:19] But let me just see here. Cash
[02:13:28] cash flow annual
[02:13:33] Free cash flow has deteriorated quite a bit.
[02:13:52] Um
[02:14:01] I mean, they're just not they're not really showing signs of turning the corner,
[02:14:07] but I think I think it's going to work. I I kind of like it. I I just wouldn't do it
[02:14:13] for clients because I would listen to the last eight calls, see if see if they're got any plans to turn around.
[02:14:20] And um you know, as far as what you're saying about temper, I don't buy things on the
[02:14:26] basis of someone else buying them. I buy it on the basis of me wanting to own the whole business. The filters being if JP
[02:14:32] Morgan was going to finance me to buy the entire business, I'd had to be 100% of my net worth as the equity slug. So, if it worked, I made 20x. If it didn't
[02:14:38] work, I went to apply for a job at Walmart Greeter. I wouldn't do that with this stock. I wouldn't put 100% of my
[02:14:44] net worth into it. But, I do think it's going to work and I like the I like the pick and I'm I'm bullish on uh rates and
[02:14:50] housing and housing in terms of home builders uh and that whole game coming back on. But we're going to benefit on
[02:14:56] it through uh Generrack and Stanley Black & Decker and some others that we can sleep like a baby. Molina, we
[02:15:03] haven't done anything because of the Medicaid risk, but it's probably going to work as well. Uh but it's not for us.
[02:15:10] That's from Lachland Neo. And uh Seth,
[02:15:16] the new client. And that's it. We'll be back next week, same time, same place. In the meantime, make it a great one.
[02:15:22] Bye for now.
[02:15:41] Heat. Heat.
[02:15:59] Hey.
