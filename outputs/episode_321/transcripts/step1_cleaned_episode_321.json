  "cleaned_transcript": "The Dow. It's up 40 points. NASDAQ's down 32. There's not that much price change on the downside thus far. Tom Hayes joins me. He's looking at the market for us. Everybody and his brother who comes on this program says, \"Yeah, we're going to get a year-end rally.\" You saying the same thing? Only the Fed could screw this up with a 90% chance of a cut next week. If they surprise the market with a hold, that would be the only thing that could cause a year-end weakness. When the stock market, it is is up 10% through October on average. The December rally is not the normal 1.2%. It's 2% or greater. And that usually starts the 14th or 15th of the month. and it is usually dominated by small cap stocks. Small caps have the strongest period of outperformance from December 15th through March. So that's where you're going to get the biggest bang for your buck. So I should invest in the Russell 2000. Russell 2000 December 14th or 15th. Just get through that Fed meeting. Make sure they're on board. As long as they're on board, we're going to rally. We got earnings growth in the S&P. Quantitative tightening stopped in December. uh 316 cuts across global central banks this year. We are a wash in liquidity. We just need that final piece ne next week. Just watch out for the PCE inflation report tomorrow morning. That's right. That could upset the apple car. That's right. It could. We shall see for sure. But you don't think it will? I don't think it will. I think uh for the Fed to back up after the market is expecting a 90 90% odds that would be very very risky for Powell. But uh uh he's done it before December 2018. So, uh, until it's done, it's not done. Until it's done, it's not done. I got it. Tom Hayes, you're all right. Thanks very much. Indeed. Still ahead. Thomas, what do you think of the Trump accounts? I love them. There's something called the rule of 72. Okay. You take the rate of return, which on an index fund would be about 10% a year. Divide 72, which means your money doubles every 7.2 years. So, if you start with a,000, by the time you're 18, you basically have 16,000. But if you get granddad, grandma to throw in a little bit and you start with 10,000, you're starting college with 160,000. So the one grows to two, grows to four, grows to eight, etc. And if you hold that money till you're 40, uh, exactly what JC was talking about, you wind up with a couple mill. I shall try to remember that. Yeah, you know, Tom, good stuff. Thank you very much indeed. On the markets, I see uh 24 points up for the Dow, virtually no change for the S&P and for the NASDAQ. Okay, Tom Scotty's special stock picks and he leads off with Fizer. Yep. As we always say, Stu, when the downside is protected, the upside takes care of itself. This appears to be a boring stock, but they just did the Metsa deal, which is a once a month GLP, one uh uh both that you can inject and will eventually become oral. They bought uh CGEN. They've got four new oncology drugs, but most importantly, they cut 7.2 billion in costs. Margins are increasing. Revenues are increasing. It's trading at eight times forward and you get a 7% dividend yield while you wait. Okay, I like this dividend. This is a sleepy stock that's going to surprise people over the next couple of years and go up a lot more because healthcare is in the gutter and it's coming out like a phoenix from the ash. Okay. Okay. Okay. I'll take the 7% dividend. All right. Okay. PayPal. You got 30 seconds. Give me PayPal. Okay. This reminds me of a company that we bought two years ago when no one wanted it that was generating huge free cash flow. you couldn't give it away. It was called Alibaba. No one wanted to buy it. The thing took off. It's tripled off the bottom. PayPal is going to be a very similar situation, generating 6 to 7 billion a year of free cash flow. Uh Alex Chris came from in it. He had a 38 bagger while he ran the small business unit at into it. Margins are increasing. Revenues are reacelerating. No one is paying attention. 30 seconds. And this is going to be this is going to be a great stock over the next two years. The hand is down. You don't pound the table confidence on that one. Thanks. All right, let's see what we got now. Look at Meta, Tom. This is for you. Look at that 4% gain for Meta. Tell me more. You know, Charlie Mer once said, \"I'm all for artificial intelligence because natural intelligence is so rare.\" Uh here's an example with Meta. The stock is up. The market likes it. They're cutting their spend on the metaverse, which was a flop. They're investing in AI. The market likes it. The stock's going to continue to follow the theme. All right, Tom. Thank you. Thank you, Lauren. And thank you Tom Hayes for being with me for the hour. I appreciate that. And we're back. And then I had the pleasure to join David Aman also on Varnney and co-f Fox Business. Thanks to Payton Jennings just yesterday before the Fed meeting. We'll listen in here. Meanwhile, Thomas Hayes joins me now. Thomas, great to see you. The Fed of course is expected to cut about a quarter of a percent today. Uh there's I think a 90% chance that's going to happen. But the question is how Powell answers\n\nOkay. Okay. Okay.

Thanks to Payton Jennings just yesterday before the Fed meeting. We'll listen in here. Meanwhile, Thomas Hayes joins me now. Thomas, great to see you. The Fed of course is expected to cut about a quarter of a percent today. Uh there's I think a 90% chance that's going to happen. But the question is how Powell answers questions  and whether or not he's going to cap any further rate cuts uh to some very strict limitations. What do you think the market's going to make of it? Well, I think that's exactly right, David. We will get a cut today. The question is the rhetoric and more importantly the summary of economic projections in September. The projections implied we would get a cut in December and then only one more cut in 2026. market doesn't want to see that again. They want to see at least two cuts in 2026. So, if there's no change in the summary of economic projections, the market might not be happy in the very short term. But have no fear, David, because Santa is here. The Santa Claus rally historically starts since 1950 on the 14th or 15th of December. The reason for that, David, is because of individual tax law selling. So most individuals spend the first two weeks of December selling off their losers. The stocks that did not work for the year and in this year the stocks that did not work were defensive stocks, dividend payers like consumer staples, healthc care, the boring stocks and dividend payers, which by the way work extremely well in an easing cycle. So we've got a couple of those for you. Well, and one of them is Papa John's. Why do you like it? Papa John's 4 and a.5% dividend yield. New CEO came from Wendy's. He ran Wendy's from 2016 to 2024. Had a threebagger when he was turning that around. Comp Store sales are up 2%. They're re franchising 85 units which is adding to free cash flow. They took guidance up and everyone loves pizza. It's a no-brainer. And by the way, as you were talking, it went from red into the green. It's now up a quarter of a percent. Hormel is entering a phase of growth. Why is that? Another dividend payer. The highest yield we've seen in a long time. They've been paying a dividend every single year since 1928, David. And for the last 60 years, it's been a dividend aristocrat, which means it raised the dividend every single year. So, not only do you lock in a 5% dividend yield, but odds are it's going to go up every single year. They've got a whole suite that's right in line with the GLP1 theme high protein snacks from the sausages to the spam to the stew to the planters peanuts to the Skippy etc. Uh this thing is now reacelerating. Some of the tariffs on food have been rolled back. Uh it's a strong healthy dividend and we think this defensive dividend payer is going to do well in a midterm election year which tends to be volatile. Tom Hayes, great information. Thank you so much for being here. Have a wonderful holiday. Let's get back to this survey that shows and we're back. And now for the grand finale, we had the CEO of GXO Logistics on our podcast one- on-one interview. Absolutely incredible interview. You're going to want to listen in here. Why? Because GXO is the embodiment of playing the AI beneficiaries that will have margin expansion and increased productivity as a result of utilizing the tool versus the hyperscalers whose capex is now higher uh than big oil. Okay. Uh capex as a percentage of operating cash flow uh margin compression. They are the spenders. We are the beneficiaries and GXO embodies that. Can't thank CEO Patrick Kellaher enough and chairman Brad Jacobs uh for uh for setting this up. Uh we're going to listen in here and take good notes. Well, I'm Tom Hayes, chairman and managing member of Great Hill Capital, and we have an extremely special guest on today on Hedge Fund Tips with Tom Hayes, the CEO of GXO Logistics, Mr. Patrick Keller.

Uh, before we before we dive into the business, I want to start with your background uh, and your decision to join GXO. You bring more than three decades of global supply chain experience and most recently as CEO of DHL Supply Chain North America, where you oversaw significant growth, operational improvements, and the roll out of advanced automation initiatives. Uh Brad Jacobs uh who we also own QXO, full disclosure, described you as a world-class operator with the experience to lead GXO through its next phase of growth. You've als uh you've also mentioned that you've watched GXO quote with a lot of admiration and maybe even a little envy since the spin-off in 2021. From that vantage point as a former competitor, what is it about GXO that made you want to join the company? And now that you're on the inside, what has stood out most, whether it's the technology, the culture, or the performance mindset that reinforces your conviction in the opportunity ahead? Thanks, H. I'm thrilled to be uh at GXO, and as you shared, I have a 32-year career in supply chain. I majored in supply chain in college. Uh I started with a company called Excel Logistics that was acquired by DHL in 2005 all the way back in 1992. And my entire supply chain career has been focused and in the contract logistics industry which is and continues to still be a massive industry 500 billion in the uh total addressable market. Wow. It is fragmented globally and it continues to grow. Throughout my career at DHL I held a number of different roles which I thought think gives me a great perspective uh on the industry competing in the industry and especially providing great services for customers. most notably probably the last two roles that I held at DHL. Uh I was from 2017 to 2023 the chief development officer globally for DHL supply chain responsible for global sales, marketing, product development, our market verticals and M&A uh during that period of time and it gave me a great global perspective of the health of the market uh where the market is especially dynamic uh and where the growth opportunities exist uh and really was uh a great foundation for my new role at GXO. But as you say, uh, I've watched GXO since 2021 in the spin-off, I think by GXO going public and really being the pure play contract logistics leader in the industry, uh, one of the few, if only publicly traded really, I think, put definition to the contract logistics market, created awareness within the market around um, the industry uh, and the great potential that the industry has. When I got the call from Brad on the opportunity to lead, uh it was uh an easy decision for me. Having been in the the industry for for a long time, loving the industry, admiring GXO, uh I was especially excited about the opportunity to join uh a pure play contract logistics organization. I think that comes with uh agility uh a very special dimension of customer focus in the services that we're providing. I love the speed of decision-m capital allocation decisions, investment and technology decisions that are being made. We are moving very fast. I love the agility and speed at which I'm able to move uh as a pure play public company in this space. Yeah, and as you say, I've watched GXO with uh en envy and admiration since 2021 as well, and especially with GXO's position as a tech leader in the space. GXO has really been on the forefront of piloting robotics, automation, uh AI now, humanoids now, uh we have in our facility, which is really exciting, waking up every day working on that. And I think that coupled with the global scale that GXO has, the vertical expertise that has been built, especially through M&A uh over the last four years, it is a phenomenal platform for growth, and we're really focused on ushering in a new era of growth at GXO. I love that. That's music to my ears. Patrick, uh I I I want to drill down on North America, which you made a clear priority on your inaugural earnings call after taking over as CEO. Uh the US generated uh business generated about 3.1 billion in revenue in 2024, roughly 26% of GXO's total. Uh small share of the 250 billion plus North American market, which speaks to the size of the opportunity we still have ahead. uh having led DHL supply chain North America, this is a market you know extremely well and you've already highlighted near near-term opportunities to accelerate growth across the region. You've pointed to aerospace and defense, industrial and life science as key verticals for expansion. Uh brought in Michael Jacobs as president of the Americas and Asia-Pacific and reallocated resources towards sales and marketing to strengthen the company's position. Could you speak to what you're doing differently in North America to compete and win new business whether in terms of your go to market strategy or vertical focus to unlock uh more of that 250 plus billion dollar opportunity? Uh and secondly, as you scale into higher value sectors like aerospace, defense and life sciences, how should investors think about the impact on margins and mix compared with the more mature omni channel retail business? Sure. That's that that's a great question and I've been very clear that North America's a priority market for us. I think to put that into context, uh about twothirds of our business globally is in the UK and Europe. Uh that is the result of a really strong and successful M&A effort in those geographies. Yeah, GXO has doubled in size from a revenue perspective since the spin-off in 2021 and that has been on the back of a lot of M&A particularly in those two theaters. Those uh M&A transactions brought with it great vertical expertise in technology, industrial and aerospace especially and then most recently with the acquisition of Win Canton brought great capabilities uh in the defense space. In looking at GXO, GXO has underdelivered from a growth perspective in North America in comparison to the market growth that we have seen in contract logistics and in comparison to competitive peers. So it is very clear that with all of the capabilities and competencies that we have, we need uh to focus more on North America as a key uh growth driver for us organically going forward. And so we've already taken big steps in uh uh positioning ourselves uh to really compete and win in North America. We've announced Michael Jacobs coming into the organization. He is leading North America and our Asia business. Michael's a 30-year veteran of the industry. He and I have worked together for 25 plus years of that with him as my customer, by the way. So he is coming from uh the customer side most recently with Ferguson Enterprises, Kurt Green Mountain before that and Toys R Us before that. So he's got phenomenal operating competencies. He understands what our customers are looking for in a contract logistics provider. Uh and he's lining up his team to make sure that we're delivering against that every day. As you mentioned from a market vertical perspective, we are putting additional emphasis on what I call the B2B verticals. That is aerospace, defense, life sciences, technology and our industrial sector. About 70% of our business at GXO is associated with consumerf facing verticals that is e-commerce, omni channel, uh CPG and uh bricks and mortar retail. And so we really want to seek some diversification in uh the size of our market verticals. We are already well positioned especially because of the M&A completed with the competencies, the talented people um and the capabilities in aerospace defense and the other B2B verticals uh to execute successfully for customers and we're investing in the organic growth of those spaces. We're very focused on us uh spinning up even further our digital marketing engine. We've already hired new salespeople, especially in the area of aerospace and defense, leaning on industry veterans to help us get in the right conversations for growth in that area. We're standing up an advisory board of uh former military uh uh veterans who are are going to help us navigate uh the defense space and understand where we can best serve customers, deliver value based on the capabilities of GXO and from that uh we think we are so well positioned uh to win in North America. this on top of um the also great work that we're doing from a technology perspective in the efforts around AI, our new GXO IQ solution which is the path to our facilities for the deployment of AI. Uh we think uh we think we're going to be very successful in North America and that is really important to our organic growth and as well as margin expansion for the business. Love it. Love it. Well, Patrick, I I want to touch on an area that's uh often often a challenge for transportation and logistics companies, but increasingly actually looks like a potential major tailwind for GXO, and that's uh tariffs and the growing reshoring trends that we're seeing as a result. Uh at the time of the spin, GXO estimated the total addressable market of roughly 430 billion across North America and Europe with about 300 billion of that spend still handled inhouse. Uh whether it's manufacturing returning to the US or companies bringing warehousing back to local markets to reduce fulfillment costs and complexity, these shifts seem like a real shot in the arm for the outsourcing trend. Uh you've also mentioned increased customer interest in foreign trade zones with GXO now operating more than 70 FTZ locations globally and exploring further expansion of that footprint which feels like a real validation of that trend. Uh could you first speak to how tariffs and reshoring trends are influencing customer decisions around outsourcing and what kind of tailwind you see that uh creating for GXO? uh how is the company positioning itself to capture that in-house spend as these shifts accelerate? And and more broadly, how do you view the long-term opportunity these structural trends present as supply chains continue to localize and the outsourcing cycle gains momentum. Starting with tariffs, tariffs are a catalyst for supply chain efficiency and and we're seeing that happen uh broadly across the business and for the contract logistics industry. Anytime you have economic disruption or what could be perceived as an economic headwind or change like a tariff coming in, it is an inspiration to drive towards more supply chain efficiency and uh and it creates a willingness on a part of our customers to make changes in their supply chain to capture those opportunities. I think in your reference to FTZ, we're operating about 70 around the world. uh that solution is becoming dramatically more interesting to customers. The price point at which uh it made sense to flow product through NFTTZ was significantly higher last year than it is today. uh and now to where product of 20 $30 value individual value uh do have an ROI associated with FTZ and leveraging a strategy of deferring um the tariff and uh duty payments for cash flow benefit and I think it's really fascinating uh that these headwinds uh or perceived headwinds of things like tariffs can create supply chain change that really becomes permanent and those efficiencies become permanent uh in the overall uh supply chain execution um uh ecosystem. And so for our business as customers are wrestling with how to address uh the nearshoring of manufacturing, the tariffs and so forth, that is all necessitating supply chain change and that is good for the industry. That is great for GXO because we're really well positioned to respond to respond to that. Additionally, from an industry perspective, and we're so well positioned as GXO, as the complexity of automation, robotics, AI, the technology stack, and the technology ecosystem that is required to address increasing supply chain complexity is evolving. We are best positioned to service our customers in executing supply chain solutions versus the in-house solution of having to build the equivalent technology stack, technology ecosystem plugged into the tools of robotics, automation and AI to enable the execution of of complex supply chain solutions. And so we are really focused as GXO in investing in that ecosystem. We think it provides real competitive differentiation not only from other contract logistics providers but especially from the decisions that our customers are making every day of whether they should insource or outsource. And it is going to be increasingly difficult to build and replicate what GXO has in place and is continuing to build uh around the systems tools and processes and especially the people that execute those solutions on a daily basis. Love it. Well, that's that's really helpful. Patrick, I I want to shift gears. I want to talk about organic growth uh which you've made clear is your top priority coming in and something you've said you really thrive on. Uh at the height of the e-commerce boom GXO was growing at high teens pace even reaching 20%. Then came the abrupt rotation from goods to services and the resulting dto cycle which led to a sharp slowdown with organic growth bottoming in Q4 2023. We saw that across many uh portfolio companies for us uh and that was the clear inflection point that that quarter marked the inflection point and since then grown uh growth has steadily improved with Q2 this year the strongest in more than 2 years and fullear guidance suggesting another step up heading into 2026 with that recovery firmly underway and nearly 700 million in incremental revenue already secured for next year. How do you view the organic growth potential of the business today? And as you think about what's driving the acceleration, whether volumes, pipeline conversion, or expansion into new verticals, where do you see the greatest opportunity to sustain the momentum and define what feels like a new era for GXO? It is a new era of growth at at GXO with the priority on organic growth. We are still going to embark on M&A. M&A will be very focused on the North America market and in the B2B industrial verticals that I talked about of aerospace, defense, technology, life sciences and industrial as you say in 2021 GXO is enjoying organic growth of high teens even as high as 20%. Um and this year we will deliver uh mids singledigit organic growth. We want to ramp back up uh to our full potential in that area. We haven't given 2026 guidance on that yet. Uh but we will be at an investor day in 2026 and everyone should look forward to that. But it doesn't take away the absence of the guidance doesn't take away from the belief that we have that that we are capable of more uh with respect to organic growth uh and already putting actions in place to deliver against that. I mentioned that we're participating in a big market over a half a billion globally. Uh and today we only hold about 3% market share in that and the market continues to grow. Everything I've read suggests a 6 to 8% KER for the contract logistics industry uh through 2030. Uh and we're well positioned to capture uh our fair share and beyond uh of that growth. In terms of the actions that that were taken, the organization has been very focused up until this point and we are at an inflection point as GXO as the organization has been very focused on M&A and digesting that M&A that has positioned the scale and the capability and the competencies that we need in order to deliver organic growth. And it's really time that that we accelerate that organic growth for the business. We're doing that through uh more robust digital marketing in terms of getting our name out there and connecting with customers uh interested in outsourcing or create and also creating interest in outsourcing. We're adding to our sales team and I mentioned we've been adding salespeople on the B2B verticals uh even since I joined four months ago. uh and we're going to be very focused on high growth markets like North America and high growth verticals uh where we are seeing a disproportionate level of growth in our pipeline uh on those B2B sectors. So uh with that um we we expect that organic growth will ramp. I would add that we're going to focus in those areas, North America especially the uh B2B market verticals especially in 2026. 2027 brings the opportunity for us to continue to dig in on our current business in Asia where we're really well positioned in Thailand, Malaysia, Singapore, uh a toe in the water in Australia. And that introduces a whole new TAM to our business in terms of organic growth that we can go after. We also have customers talking to us and interested in pulling us into the Middle East. Uh and we think in 2027 beyond uh we'll be ready for focus and uh attention to that theater. Uh that is another opportunity for TAM and our business all while our our teams continue to grow our presence in the consumerf facing sectors of e-commerce and retail and CPG and the markets of the UKI and Europe where we continue to see great growth opportunity. I would I would also say that uh a lot of what's happening in the world in terms of reshoring uh particularly infrastructure investments in Europe and so forth really plays well to to the capabilities uh that we've uh acquired through M&A over the past years and those B2B sectors where we have really strong capabilities. So we believe the market's coming to us in that uh that outsourcing makes a lot of sense for uh customers in that market uh and we're well positioned to execute against that. Love to hear Patrick, you mentioned getting your fair share. I hope you get an unfair share because your execution is so superior. Uh moving on, Patrick, in your comments in the at the third quarter results, you highlighted driving margin structurally higher as a key focus area for you. I I know you're currently integrating Wington, which should unlock some cost synergies for GXO, but can you talk through the levers uh that are at your disposal to drive margins structurally higher? Sure. Organic growth is my first priority. The margin expansion is a really close second. Okay. Respect to win Canton. Uh we we are on the path of capturing the M&A synergy opportunities there. We will achieve our goal of a 60 million run rate as we exit 2026. Uh about 10 to 12 million of that has already been captured and the actions in place to capture the balance. Um we are still seeing relatively flat volume plus or minus one or one one or two% from our customers and our growth plans and our margin expansion plans are not dependent on volume coming back from our customers but rather more through two key levers and that is organic growth which I talked about participation in the North American market which is which is a a healthy market from a profitability perspective as well as driving our presence in the B2B verticals which come with more complex supply chain solutions, higher risk and execution uh and therefore higher reward and profitability of the solutions that we sell in those areas. Uh so from a portfolio perspective on organic growth we expect a benefit on margin expansion and driving towards that. The other is uh on operational execution and our operational excellence agenda. I recently announced uh that we would be hiring uh and and have now identified an individual to be announced shortly as the global chief operating officer. That individual is focused on looking at our business through a global lens because I believe the level of M&A that the business has done over the last four years. The business at GXO has been run as uh regional silos really not looking yet at at the business from a global perspective and how we can leverage our scale in the best way possible. The new global COO is a big part of putting that global lens on the business in really two dimensions. One is from a labor productivity perspective making sure that we've deployed the best tools to drive the best productivity uh and the best underlying labor cost. doing that in a consistent way around what I would call the GXO way uh globally across our 1,200 plus operations and we believe there's uh labor savings opportunities there uh where we can benefit from margin expansion our customers can benefit from lower cost the second is around technology and we continue to be a leader in automation and warehouse robotics AI now humanoids um we are driving towards making sure that we're working with the right partners that the solutions that we're deploying deliver ROI and accelerating the pace in which we're getting these solutions into the hands of our customers to create value for them and to drive margin expansion in our business.

And then\nfinally  from an SGNA perspective uh we we think we have the uh the teams in place in order to be successful uh and we continue to drive particularly looking through a global lens. Where can we leverage our global scale around procurement uh as an example to make sure that we get the best leverage of our SGNA uh for margin expansion as we go forward. We are planning uh an investor day in 2026, a date to be announced and we're going to share a lot of details uh on each of those pillars in terms of our path forward over the next three years. Well, it's great to hear that Patrick and you know you hear so much noise about AI is going to increase productivity and margins and humanoid robots and honestly the only company that I can see already doing it and already implementing this technology way ahead of the curve is GXO. So that's really really promising. Uh, switching gears to another value added service that GXO offers, I'd love to touch on reverse logistics and the long-term opportunity in that space. Uh, in traditional brick-andmortar retail, only about 1 in 10 items are typically returned, but that number jumps to nearly 1 in three for ecommerce. A lot of people don't know that. Uh, for retailers, outsourcing reverse logistics seems like a no-brainer. GXO has cited that roughly 96% of returns processed through its network are returned to stock compared with an industry average of about 25% of items uh ending up in landfills. So, not only is this an attractive opportunity from a cost-saving perspective for retailers, all you retailers listening into my call, you need to reach out to Patrick. Uh but it's also a lucrative higher margin segment for GXO with these contracts carrying significantly higher margins uh and revenue multipliers compared to standard contracts without these services. Could you first speak to how large you think this opportunity could become as e-commerce continues to expand its share of the overall retail pie? Uh why do you think more omni channel channel retailers haven't yet outsourced their reverse logistics given the clear cost and operational benefits? And\n\n We are planning uh an investor day in 2026, a date to be announced and we're going to share a lot of details uh on each of those pillars in terms of our path forward over the next three years.

And finally , how should investors think about the margin profile of these contracts and their role in driving a structurally higher margin base for GXO over time? Sure. The the uh the third party logistics market for reverse logistics is really exciting. I think total addressable markets now about $60 billion last I heard. It is a service that is embedded in what we do for customers today. Uh leveraging our process expertise. We've deployed AI in this area by the way as uh medium to try and capture the highest value for return products for our customers as they look to either return product to stock or put those product out to the resale market. We we acquired a really great business called Service Tech with the Clipper acquisition in which we're actually doing repair of iPads, cell phones. Um I've seen expensive Italian coffee machines being repaired. And that's all a great way in terms of how we're increasing the margins for our customer of the resale of those products and the capture of the value of product that is being returned. uh and we in turn are being rewarded with uh good margins on the provision of those services. One of the things that really excites me about this space is the competencies that we have in the retail and e-commerce space which we execute so well uh have high application in the B2B space and today we are managing cell phone returns at at a very high scale. Um a lot of regulation in Europe is uh is really driving uh customer interest in solutions for returns because of regulatory requirements that have to be met and that is going to be a real catalyst for growth and it's been fascinating to see in the data center work that we're doing where we are performing services in support of the sustainment and maintenance of data centers t\n\n### FEATURED_COMPANY_DEEP_DIVES\nthird party logistics market for reverse logistics is really exciting.

If you'd put 1 million bucks with those investments, you made 300 million, 300x if you aggregate all three of them. So he knows how to generate value for owners. Uh, and he's the chairman of your company. He's been leveraging technology and automation in traditionally ### FEATURED_COMPANY_DEEP_DIVES outdated industries to win share. GXO is a prime example of that, leading the industry in automation with over 40% of revenue from automated operations and more than 1500 uh 15,000 automated units and cobots already deployed across the network. We've long viewed GXO as one of the most underappreciated ways to play the broader automation and robotics theme. Where does GXO stand today relative to the rest of the industry? And how do you view automation as both a competitive differentiator and a key driver of scale? What are you seeing from customers in terms of interest and demand for automation within the sales pipeline? And uh lastly, as you continue moving uh toward more fully automated sites, how how should investors think about that margin uplift uh productivity improvements and customer stickiness that come with greater automation? And just as a dovetail uh on GXO Direct, which gives midsize customers access to the same technology and automation investments that would typically be out of reach, uh how would you describe that value proposition and how significant of an opportunity do you see for that platform as automation continues to scale across your customer base? Patrick, leadership starts at the top. Uh, GXO is a leader in technology and and I'm smiling based on your comments with Brad. Um, Brad Brad is always been a pioneer in technology. Technology features very high in all his businesses.    and position something uh that is uh more improved and can deliver a better result. It's integrated with our data lake uh and and that is a big part of how it deres its value uh is being able to access a very large data lake associated with those operations that we run. Uh and so for customers who come on board with GXO uh as we start up for you uh you're plugged into GXO IQ just as a process of being integrated with us then it is really about making sure that we're driving the deployment uh of those AI tools and continue to drive continuous improvement in those AI tools going forward. So, as said, we we've deployed to about 30 sites uh so far uh with plans in place in 2026 to accelerate that deployment. That's great.   Patrick, it it was nice to hear during the conference call that the the long- aaited Wington integration is now officially underway after a little hiccup there with the CMA.   Sounds great.\n\n restrictions and get the teams working together. uh and we're already seeing uh results in the pipeline of new opportunities uh from those uh revenue and solution synergies that we have. The average deal cycle time in the contract logistics industry is 6 to9 months. So, uh, the conversion of that pipeline, uh, will come in in the middle of 26 and we'll see that, uh, but for me, I'm super excited, uh, about the revenue synergies that come here and how that can underpin our organic growth priority as we're moving forward into 2026 and going forward.\n### MISCELLANEOUS\nWell, Patrick, this has been really really helpful to all the investors out there for sure. Uh just want to encourage people to listen in to the quarterly conference calls. go to the website, go to the investor relations, see all the documentation and and the plan because this is going to be a phenomenal story.

So\n\n### MEDIA_APPEARANCE_RECAP\nwith that said\n\n### QUOTES_OF_THE_WEEK\nThe biggest mistake investors make is to believe that what happened in the recent past is likely to persist. What happened in the recent past? Defensives and staples and healthcare didn't work. What's happening? They are turning the corner. Healthcare is one of the biggest performers since the last couple of months. That theme will persist and excel in 2026. Midterm election years are volatile. Defensives and healthcare and staples do best and dramatically outperform the S&P.\n### MACRO_DATA_SLIDES\nChina Internet versus US Internet uh software 12 month forward PE.

This will persist in 2026 and beyond. largest cumulative losses before a young startup company's turn to profit compared with cash burn for OpenAI and Anthropic based on media reports. Uh so we've never seen a cash burn like this uh between uh Anthropic and Open AI. The last one we saw was Uber and that actually worked uh and Tesla looks tiny in comparison to what we're seeing with Open AI. So, it'll be interesting to see how that plays out, especially with Gemini 3 taking the lead and Quen, the Alibaba model, kicking butt. Uh, a lot of great stuff going on. Commodity 10-year rolling returns, highest since bonds versus bonds since 2008. We've been talking about the commodity opportunity. It's starting to play out. We're seeing it in our positions like Albamaro, like Comtock Resources, like National Oil Well, Varco. Super exciting times. \nAI adoption rates by corporate customers are slowing. We saw that by uh with Oracle last night. Uh we'll keep it PG s the bed on earnings. Uh you know, don't buy the hype, ladies and gentlemen. The AI stories are going to be the GXOs of the world, not the hyperscalers in at at the same scale. They will be spending. We will be benefiting. Low expectations consensus long-term growth forecast near a record low sell side analyst. Uh that's uh always same with consumer sentiment which is at a record low which is why we had to get in another discretionary stock before a year end with Papa John's. All my happy billionaire and centillionaire and decillionaire clients that got their Papa John's gift card are smiling so wide they could eat a banana sideways. Last year they got Vans sneakers. This year they got Papa John's. We try to give them something from the portfolio each year and help earnings power. Uh I had one uh smart alec send me an email. I hope we uh I hope we initiate a position in race which is the ticker for Ferrari. So next year my stock my stocking is filled a little bit more fully. Uh just enjoy your pizza. We'll talk about Ferrari in 2026. \nCredit metrics are improving. European equities tracking be toward best year versus the US since 2006. If you've been listening to this podcast, you were positioned for international and you crushed it this year outperforming the US having emerging markets having XUS share of hedge fund stock holdings in top quintile of beta. Uh natural gas prices sore amid LNG export boom. We love that com stock. Lithium's recovery is only just starting. UBS says I love UBS. I love all the pessimistic European banks. They're always pessimistic and they always get it after the fact. They couldn't sell it hard enough when the stock was at $58. This is our Albamaro position. Now that it's at $130, they're saying it's just getting started after a double plus. Amen. Hallelujah. Keep pitching it. So in another uh turn and we get to 3x and 3 and a halfx and 4x we can lay it off to all the people that you are getting excited at 200 bucks a share indexed return of consumer discretionary versus S&P 500. This is what we're talking about ladies and gentlemen why we had to get some discretionary. Everyone's getting out. We be getting in as they say in the uh neighborhood. So price changes for selective market classes. We're seeing uh car prices normalize. This was core to our Cooper standard thesis which is now benefiting looks like today. Even today up again up around $32. Those of you who have been with us um for some time, we initiated in May of 2022 and went live on the claim and countdown Fox Business. Uh our starting basis was $510. It's now at 32 going a lot higher and small caps start to take off midmon in December and tend to outperform through March. Uh and we think that Cooper will benefit from that trend as well in addition to incentives going up from the OEMs and affordability uh improving. Fed funds rate versus core PCE inflation tends to follow. Rates are coming down more. \nThere was news yesterday that Trump is actually interviewing Walsh. Uh, that would be a mistake in my opinion. Go with Hasset. Go with Waller. Go with Bowman. Uh, don't go with Wars. He has historically been a hawk, not a dove. He will say in his interview that he's a dove and then he will turn into a hawk. Not dissimilar to what we saw with Powell. Although Powell came out yesterday and I think Powell wants to go out like Seinfeld. He was uh uh very balanced yesterday. Did a good job. and he may in fact just pull off the soft landing if he gets another cut in before his exit, which is a coin flip. Uh he can salvage a really good legacy. So kudos to him and uh pat on the back if he pulls it off. Uh spread of 100 day trailing returns, that's growth minus the S&P uh IGB. So that got smashed uh just in the last few months. All the Momo stocks uh Trump is approving tiny cars to be built in America. You can be sure that Cooper Standard will provide tiny door ceiling, fluid transfer and uh uh systems for the cars. Tiny, large, you name it, we got it. Cooper Standard is going up. Opinion, not advice. Go to hedgefundtips.com and click on terms.

Small cap halfmon seasonality as we can see second half of December is the highest performance uh part of the year that will help some of our smaller cap positions the goose the Cooper standard the VF corpse uh that's not not quite a small cap the Varcos uh etc. So, even even Papa John's to a lesser extent, it's not a huge company. Here's consumer sentiment we've been talking about. This is why we had to get some discretionary and get some pizza on the plate in addition to our vans and our North Face and our Timberland and our um although Estee Lauder is not a discretionary, that is a staple.

Zootopia 2 is now eyeing a 1.5 to 1.7 billion run rate at the worldwide box office. Oh, and by the way, AI beneficiary, not cost center. It only cost them $150 million to produce. AI beneficiaries versus AI cost centers all day long. The outlook for US GDP growth has improved. Discretionary investors are implicitly pricing in a sharp slowing in earnings growth. Good luck with that, ladies and gentlemen, because if the Supreme Court votes against the tariffs, not only will Trump find a way to keep the tariffs going in the intermediate term, but in the short term versus returning that money to the foreign countries, he will take that money and dividend it out as a check to US taxpayers. And I'm going to tell you that the people who received the $2,000 checks are going to be using it to buy Papa John's pizza and vans. So, that would be a great thing, not a bad thing. We'll see what happens on that front. But uh I have a sneaking suspicion between the increased tax refunds from the big beautiful bill fiscal impulse and potentially dividend checks discretionary is going to do a okay in 2026 especially from where we're buying it. Rolling one-year correlation between healthcare and NASDAQ excess returns versus equal weight S&P 500.

Uh and when you get these type of uh divergences, the price tends to back up. Which is why we think indices are going to be subdued and volatile next year because of the dramatic waiting of the hyperscalers even as the groups that have underperformed defensives, staples, healthc care are going to outperform dramatically and lots of money will be made under the surface. it will not be seen in the indices. So, the passive indexers will be disappointed. The overweight tech people will be excessively disappointed.

You can see it at 34%. So if it doesn't do well or consolidates the gains next year, the indices won't do well and consolidate the gains. But these other groups will start to pick up the materials. You're already seeing what a preview of what's to come with Albamaro. Uh REITs are going to start to outperform Crown Castle. Staples are going to start to outperform the Dagios, the Estee Lers of the world. And then you're going to see international continue to outperform with the weaker dollar aka Baba BU at L. And then beneficiaries of a weaker dollar like GXO who has tons of their earnings outside the US at present will benefit from that weaker dollar as those earnings are repatriated. uh annualized total outperformance by style during all bull markets since 1970.

We'll see if they're they're in time. I'm sure they'll do okay because they'll control the supply and lay off a lot to retail and so on. Market implied Fed path.

A few weeks ago, Okelly and CFO Ryan Grimsland gave an excellent highlevel update on the turnaround's progress and fielded investor\nquestions  at the Gabelli Fund's 49th annual automotive aftermarket symposium. For anyone wanting to understand the key levers being pulled and why we have such strong conviction in this management team, the discussion is well worth the time. We're not going to play it here because we already had the 45minute interview with Patrick Keller, but you should definitely listen. It's well worth a while. We've highlighted the key points in the earnings results as well as the conference call. You want to go to hedge fun.com and do that. But here are the 10 key points. Advance delivered 2.04 04 billion in revenue, down 5% year-on-year, beating consensus by 13 million with the decline driven primarily by operating fewer stores after this year's footprint optimization that closed 700 underperforming locations, adjusted earnings of 92 cents, beat expectations by 18 cents, and compared to a loss of 5 cents in the same period last year, too. Comparable same store sales grew 3% for the quarter, landing at the high end of management's low singledigit guidance and accelerating from last quarters 10 basis points positive contributions from both the pro and DIY channels. Three, the pro channel delivered just over 4% comp growth in Q3, making it its fifth straight quarter of positive performance on a 2-year basis. Trends remain positive in Q4. So far with the new strategy gaining traction as store availability has improved to 96 to 97% from the prior low 90% range and time to serve has fallen by more than 10 minutes. The main street customer group the highest margin segment within pro still represents the single largest opportunity for the DIY channel delivered positive low singledigit comps during the quarter showing sequential improvement in transactions on both a one-year and two-year basis. Moving into Q4, management has seen more pressure on the consumer and some volatility in week-toeek transactions, but remains confident in the long-term outlook given the non-discretionary nature of the business with 90% of sales tied to repair and maintenance. Remember, the average car is 14 years old now. Five, the market hub strategy continued to progress with management now expecting to open 14 new market hubs this year compared to their prior expectations of only 10. They're still targeting 60 market hubs by mid2027 and expect to end the year at 33. These hubs carry 75 to 80,000 SKUs and provide same day parts availability to a service area of 60 to 90 stores which has driven a 100 basis point comp sales uplift to supported locations so far and creates incremental opportunities to gain market share. In addition, management expects to have 16 distribution centers by year end compared to 38 just two years ago, as well as open 30 new stores for the full year and still target at least 100 new openings over the next two years. 30 new stores and 100 new openings over the next two years. That is not a company in decline. That is a company that cleaned up a mess and is now back in growth mode. Expansion mode. Six. Advance has invested 50 million in store upgrades year to date, which include improved HVAC systems, roofing, parking lot, signage, and is more than double the total capex allocated to these projects last year. These upgrades cover more than 1400 store locations year-to- date compared to just 440 in 2024. Management expects capex to total 250 million for the year, lower than the prior 300 guidance due to timing shift into 2026. Seven, adjusted gross margins came in at 44.8%. 8% for the quarter, up 260 basis points from last year's 42.3. Adjusted operating margins, the most important metric in the AAP turnaround, came in at 4.4%, up 368 basis points year-on-year and the strongest quarterly performance in more than two years. Management remains confident in the 2027 target of 7% adjusted operating margins with street consensus still forecasting just 4.8% for 2027, a number we expect to move higher as it becomes obvious. Eight year-to- date free cash flow stands at an outflow of 277 million which includes 130 million of cash charges related to restructuring activities. Management expects fullear free cash flow to be an outl and 90 million and includes 150 million of cash charges. Backing these out, AAP would have delivered positive free cash flow for the year, giving management confidence in the ability to generate positive free cash flow in 2026 and beyond. Nine management narrowed and reaffirmed the midpoint of fullear guidance. Now expecting net sales at 8.55 to 8.6 compared billion compared to 8.4 to 8.6 which implies an upgrade of 750 million in sales. Comp sales growth is expected to be 7/10 of 1% to 1.3% and adjusted operating margin is projected to be between 2.4 and 2.6% 6% which implies more than 200 basis points of annual margin expansion in the first year of the turnaround plan. And 10 management views first brands as a one-off situation rather than a broader concern for the aftermarket industry. AAP currently sources less than 2% of cost of goods from the supplier with plenty of alternative options among the hundreds of vendors they already work with. Management recorded a non-cash charge of 28 million in cost of sales during the quarter to account for future credit losses on receivables from first brands and this will not affect fullear guidance.

Revenues are at all-time highs. Gross margins are at or near all-time highs. Uh priceto free cash flow multiple at or near all-time lows. And you can't give the stock away. We think that will change.

And you can't give the stock away. We think that will change. And here is  why. Here are the 10 key points from the most recent earnings call. Etsy delivered Q3 revenue of 687 678 million up 6.1% yearonear and ahead of Wall Street consensus by $21 million driven by a 12.7% increase in seller services revenue to 210 million while marketplace revenue declined 1.7 yearonear to 468 million. ETS's take rate of 24.9% came in ahead of guidance, expanding 220 basis points year-on-year and 90 basis points sequentially. Two, consolidated GMS came in at 2.72 billion, up 9/10 of 1% yearonear and above the top end of management's prior 2.6 to 2.7 billion guidance range. ETS's marketplace GMS totaled four 2.43 billion ahead of expectations and down 2.4% yearonear but improving by 300 basis points sequentially. GMS per active buyer on a trailing 12-month basis was 121 down 1.6 year-on-year percent but improving sequentially and continuing to show signs of stabilization. Three, continues to be a bright spot with gross merchandise sales of 992 million. I'm sorry. Uh gross merchandise sales of 292.1 million, up 39.4% 4% year-on-year, a 400 basis points acceleration from last quarter, driven by 59% gross merchandise sales growth in the US. Deep depot active sellers climbed 40.8% year-onear to 3 million and active buyers rose to 38.8% to 6.6 million. Depot is now tracking toward annualized run rate of $1 billion plus and management continues to see significant opportunity to scale it into a multi-billion dollar asset, launching the brand's first ever campaign during the quarter to further raise US awareness. Four, earlier in the quarter, Etsy signed a partnership with OpenAI to become the first live partner within chat GPT's instant checkout. This gives Etsy an early foothold in the fast growing agentic commerce channel with initial results looking promising. Early data suggests these buyers have higher purchase intent than traditional search, driving higher conversion rates and a noticeable spike in purchases from this traffic, albeit off a small base. Five, ETS's app now accounts for 46% of total gross merchandise sales, up from 42.8% last year with app-based GMS growing 5% year-on-year and outperforming non-app GMS by 13 percentage points. The app continues to drive higher engagement and purchase frequency with app users generating 5x more visits, viewing 3x more pages per visit, and being 1.5x more likely to convert. Six, consolidated adjusted ebida margins came in at 24.5.4% for the quarter, in line with management's prior 25% guidance, but below last year's 27.7%. The margin pressure is primarily tied to increased marketing investment at depot. While the Etsy marketplace continues to post margins just shy of 30%, consolidated marketing spend increased 6% year-on-year to 208 million or 30.7% of revenue and is expected to remain elevated into the first half of 2026. 7 management repurchased 2.1 million shares during the quarter for a total of 120 million at an average price of 5714. Over the past 3 years, Etsy has reduced its share count by 21.5% through 2.47 billion in buybacks, making our slice of the pie that much bigger without putting up any additional capital. The current repurchase program still has 356 million remaining, 6.6% of the total market cap, leaving plenty of dry powder for continued to buybacks, supported by 1.6 billion of cash on the balance sheet. Look at these repurchases. It's through the roof and shares outstanding down 21%. Eight. Etsy announced that longtime CEO Josh Silverman will step down after more than eight years and transition to executive chair through the end of 2026. Cruy Patel Goyal will assume the CEO role at the start of 2026. She has been with Etsy for more than 15 years, spent two years as Depop CEO, where all the growth is, where GMS and the buyer base nearly doubled, and most recently served as ETS's president and chief growth officer. Nine, Etsy generated 205 million in free cash flow during the quarter, bringing trailing 12 months free cash flow to 635 million, 12% of market cap, and converting 83% of adjusted EBID into free cash flow. and 10 management guided Q4 GMS to 3.5 to 3.65 billion with the midpoint implying further sequential improvement in the combined Etsy marketplace and depot year-on-year growth rate despite an uncertain consumer backdrop. The Q4 take rate is expected to be 24.5% with adjusted EBA margins under pressure at 24% driven primarily by the significant sequential increase in depot brand marketing during the holiday season.\n\nThe margin pressure is primarily tied to increased marketing investment at depot.

Okay, free cash flow is 135. Let's take a look at income. Take a look at quarterly. See what's happening there. Seems like it's trying to recover a little bit. kept the share count pretty steady. I look I think it's worth doing some more work on. Um it wouldn't be my f first choice in the uh chemicals area, but I think you're on to something. So go listen to the last eight calls, understand the turnaround plan. What did they say they were going to do? What have they done? What's the catalyst for change? And I think you might have something there.\n### ASK_ME_ANYTHING_QA\nWhat's your opinion on General Mills?

Uh, financial analysis. All right. Ferve thing's trading like it's uh going out of business. Doesn't seem like it is though. Uh $27 billion of debt. So that's what people are worried about. Let's see what the free cash flow is. 7 billion. Nope, that's not that's not free cash flow. 4.6 billion. Uh income statement. I think you can do it. I mean, it's not going to be a position for us, but I think you're okay there. Lucy J, uh, asking about Generrack. I think they're being conservative, not the other way around. Felipe Andrew Pinkos.

And so, Dagio is generating 2.7 billion of free cash flow. Uh, there's certainly some leverage.

Balance sheet 2.6 billion, 3.7 billion receivables and uh long-term debt at 21. Uh, you know, we understand the cap table. We understand how much cash they generate. We understand the the value of the brands. They could always sell off one or two brands if they had to. They won't have to, but they might do it to be to benefit. And we also like to see despite I mean this is kind of amazing when you think about it because drinking was at its peak in 2022 during COVID and the revenues are still holding in there and um let's take a look at a quarterly basis reacelerating dramatic. Well, hold on for a second. reasonably solid there. And then let's take a look here. Share count been going down. We like this. Look, you got to have a play in the um alcohol business. It's a it's a massive overshoot. people still drink. They're gonna drink I I don't want the mass market stuff because people that are overweight probably drink a ton of beer and the cheaper stuff and now that they're on GLPs, they're drinking less. But the high-end premiumization, they're going to drink less. They're going to drink better. Dagio's perfectly positioned. It was mismanaged. Now they have an adult in the room.

Uh we love this story and uh we're sticking to it. \n### ASK_ME_ANYTHING_QA\nYesterday we got two questions on Dagio because the stock was down. Um, Lucas Tangrove, what do you think of Hunts? H, that's Huntsman's company Chemicals. I think I like it. Let me just take a quick look and confirm that. Yeah, I've looked at this one and I do like it. I think a lot of opportunity in the chemical companies. Okay, there we go. That family will turn it around. They know how to run the business. Look, it's I mean, there's no imminent sign of a turnaround. So, I would definitely get on the calls before you do anything, but they will fix it when the cycle turns. They have the operating leverage. I think it's a good company, uh, run by a good group, and you're going to make some money off of that for sure. let's just make sure that the balance sheet is not going to smoke you in the meantime. And the answer is no. They've paid down a bunch of debt and they still are generating ample free cash flow. So, uh, like that one. Good job, Lucas. On to the next. Matthew Tumbo. Uh, how do you approach tax loss harving? This is uh this is tax loss. Haring harvesting is for gamblers that think they can time the market. We covered the um we covered if you're out the the best 10 days and often times you sell in the first two weeks of December to tax loss harvest when everyone else is selling. And what happens to all those losers is they get bid huge uh at the end of December and the first two weeks of January, which you can't replace in inside of the 30 days for wash sale rules. So bottom line is if you're a gambler and like, oh, my trading thing went wrong and therefore I'm going to take my losses and and like try to pretend that it's a win because you screwed up. Uh have at it. But if you're owning a piece of the business and you're going to gamble that you can get out for 30 days, take the tax benefit and get back in 30 days from now, I mean, good luck with that nonsense. At the end of the day, own the business and sell it when it's fully valued and call it a day. Like, uh, I know that your typical financial advisor is going to say, \"This is the value ad we provide. We're gonna harvest all your losses.\" How about not having massive losses? how why don't you try that? Um, you know, and um my suggestion is don't have a ton of losses and if you have a company that's taking longer to realize full value, just sit on your hands and wait. Stop trying to be so cute about everything all the time to save a few pennies on taxes. Every time I've ever waited till January to take the taxes into the next year or done tax loss harvesting, it always backfires. either the stock tanks because everyone was doing it, waiting till January 1st to sell the big winner or uh I sell it in the hole in December and it runs away by mid January and I missed 10 15% of the move. It's never worth it. Uh if you're underwriting these businesses properly, if you're trading and gambling, yeah, take all your losses. I'm sure you have plenty of them. Alex Trick, uh just discovered the podcast a few weeks ago. Already a big fan. I love that. added your pod to a weekly finance call with a friend to discuss and learn from. Curious about your take on DGXX. Uh, Digit Power Inc. Well, welcome. Um, you are probably early in the learning curve. I would go back and listen to a bunch of other episodes so you can start to learn the framework a little bit better. But, uh, this is still negative free cash flow. We're not interested in those type of businesses. But um appreciate you sending it. Uh yeah, this is data center. This is this is short-term shiny object stuff. It might work, but it's gambling and we don't do that here. So, um keep listening in. You're going to learn a ton. And then if you still want to play these spec plays, uh shiny object theme plays, flavor of the month, Wall Street fashion show stuff, you can do that with a small amount of your gambling money. But the investing money, buying pieces of great businesses at good businesses at great prices, that's what we do. Uh, good businesses at great prices versus great businesses at good prices. When Buffett had his greatest performance of his career, when he was running the partnerships, he bought good businesses at great prices. When he had free float from the insurance companies and a permanent capital vehicle, he started buying great businesses at good prices because he had a lot more money to put to work. But the performance suffered over the long term uh relative to when he was buying good business at great prices. So on the one hand, Charlie quote unquote educated him. On the other hand, Charlie led to his underperformance. Uh but also the law of large numbers impacted that as well. Paul Smith, I got that. Thank you for that. Uh Cameron Hector, I'd love your take on buy now pay later. blah blah blah. Uh yeah, look, Cameron, uh let's see. Uh source of potential consumer leverage analogist on a smaller mortgage buildup. Okay, it's not going to get anywhere near the mortgage build buildup. Uh but it is going to get flushed at some point. So, how's your view shape the way you think about consumer discretionary stocks that lean on buy now pay later? Uh PayPal specifically, I've been a listener since the COVID lows. You've helped my account significantly and made investing feel both fun and peaceful at the same time. Thank you, Cameron. Well, Cameron, you are a longtime listener, first- time caller. Thank you for being around that long. Glad your account is up big. Um, I hate buy now pay later. I think it's a uh crappy product that works until it doesn't. and um it's small enough in the scheme of PayPal that it will be beneficial in the long term. They did a good job of selling off a lot of their portfolio. So, I hope they continue to initiate it and sell it off to suckers because sooner or later the chickens come home to roost. It's a lowquality business, but it's high growth when it works and it's high margin when it works. just lay it off like all the smart people did during the housing crisis is they would originate and lay off to suckers and hopefully PayPal will do the same as they have been so far. Adam F question on PayPal. Same thing. I can tell you that I can look at a chart of PayPal and Dagio and if it was read that day, we'll have three AMAs on PayPal and Dagio and it's perfect metaphor for the psychology of an investor looking at day-to-day ticks.

This is a broken Momo stock. And uh you know, if I owned it, would I be selling here? Probably not. But would I be encouraged to be a buyer here? The answer is no. Uh Tom F. Blooming Brands turn around. Yeah, I looked at this one. We ultimately passed on it uh for uh Papa John's. Uh but I think you'll probably be okay here. I uh let me just try to understand. Let me take a look at the balance sheet. I think the whole group is going to be good in 2026, which is counterintuitive annual. So, I got 100 million of free cash flow. share accounts come down balance sheet. That's your issue? 250 million and then they've got how much debt? Well, they paid down the debt a little bit. I think it's a levered play. I think the other aspect was I just think their product is Let's see. Blue and Brands. No, Bonefish Grill. Yeah, I think you're okay. I think you're okay here. I kind of like this one. It was just a little too risky for me, but um when the group works, you'll probably have a threeagger and I'll have a two bagger. So, you may win on this, but you have a lot more risk than I do at Papa John's. So, there's that. Uh, evaluate UHT, Universal Health Realy Income Trust. Uh yeah, I hate the medical property reats because they always seem to screw up something. Uh I just avoid them. I I'm telling you, if you're going to have negative surprises in the REIT space, it's always going to be in the medical property reats. I just avoid them as a rule. I would suggest you do the same. And you know, the difference between you and me is when God was handing out FOMO jeans, he didn't give it to me. So if uh doubles over the next six months, I don't give a like it doesn't bother me in one way whatsoever that I missed it because the down number one is don't rule number one don't lose money rule number two don't forget rule number one and these medical properties they always figure out a way to screw it up so Bill C ETF PSC we don't do a lot on ETFs um PSC small cap healthcare yeah why not I'd rather pick companies. I know you already picked out Fizer. Was wondering you could look at AKBA. I'll bet there's a lot of dilution in this stock without even looking at it. Ah, it's a biotech. We don't do individual biotechs. Our our biotech basket has been a home run by the way. Still free cash flow negative. Let me just see how piggy this management has been. Uh yeah, there's a place in hell reserved for management that does this to their owners. So they've increased the share count from 118 million to 245. Uh no thank you. on to the next.

Only the Fed could screw this up with a 90% chance of a cut next week. If they surprise the market with a hold, that would be the only thing that could cause a year-end weakness. When the stock market, it is is up 10% through October on average. The December rally is not the normal 1.2%. It's 2% or greater. And that usually starts the 14th or 15th of the month. and it is usually dominated by small cap stocks. Small caps have the strongest period of outperformance from December 15th through March. So that's where you're going to get the biggest bang for your buck. So I should invest in the Russell 2000. Russell 2000 December 14th or 15th. Just get through that Fed meeting. Make sure they're on board. As long as they're on board, we're going to rally. We got earnings growth in the S&P. Quantitative tightening stopped in December. uh 316 cuts across global central banks this year. We are a wash in liquidity. We just need that final piece ne next week. Just watch out for the PCE inflation report tomorrow morning. That's right. That could upset the apple car. That's right. It could. We shall see for sure. But you don't think it will? I don't think it will. I think uh for the Fed to back up after the market is expecting a 90 90% odds that would be very very risky for Powell. But uh uh he's done it before December 2018. So, uh, until it's done, it's not done. Until it's done, it's not done. I got it. Tom Hayes, you're all right. Thanks very much. Indeed. Still ahead. Thomas, what do you think of the Trump accounts? I love them. There's something called the rule of 72. Okay. You take the rate of return, which on an index fund would be about 10% a year. Divide 72, which means your money doubles every 7.2 years. So, if you start with a,000, by the time you're 18, you basically have 16,000. But if you get granddad, grandma to throw in a little bit and you start with 10,000, you're starting college with 160,000. So the one grows to two, grows to four, grows to eight, etc. And if you hold that money till you're 40, uh, exactly what JC was talking about, you wind up with a couple mill. I shall try to remember that. Yeah, you know, Tom, good stuff. Thank you very much indeed. On the markets, I see uh 24 points up for the Dow, virtually no change for the S&P and for the NASDAQ.

The Fed of course is expected to cut about a quarter of a percent today. Uh there's I think a 90% chance that's going to happen. But the question is how Powell answers\n\n### FEATURED_COMPANY_DEEP_DIVES\ng time. They've been paying a dividend every single year since 1928, David. And for the last 60 years, it's been a dividend aristocrat, which means it raised the dividend every single year. So, not only do you lock in a 5% dividend yield, but odds are it's going to go up every single year. They've got a whole suite that's right in line with the GLP1 theme high protein snacks from the sausages to the spam to the stew to the planters peanuts to the Skippy etc. Uh this thing is now reacelerating. Some of the tariffs on food have been rolled back. Uh it's a strong healthy dividend and we think this defensive dividend payer is going to do well in a midterm election year which tends to be volatile. GXO is the embodiment of playing the AI beneficiaries that will have margin expansion and increased productivity as a result of utilizing the tool versus the hyperscalers whose capex is now higher uh than big oil. Okay. Uh capex as a percentage of operating cash flow uh margin compression. They are the spenders. We are the beneficiaries and GXO embodies that. Can't thank CEO Patrick Kellaher enough and chairman Brad Jacobs uh for uh for setting this up.\n\n### FEATURED_COMPANY_DEEP_DIVES\nthird party logistics market for reverse logistics is really exciting. I think total addressable markets now about $60 billion last I heard. It is a service that is embedded in what we do for customers today. Uh leveraging our process expertise. We've deployed AI in this area by the way as uh medium to try and capture the highest value for return products for our customers as they look to either return product to stock or put those product out to the resale market. We we acquired a really great business called Service Tech with the Clipper acquisition in which we're actually doing repair of iPads, cell phones.\n\n one of the greatest wealth creators for shareholders in history between Waste Connection, uh, United Rentals and XPO. If you'd put 1 million bucks with those investments, you made 300 million, 300x if you aggregate all three of them. So he knows how to generate value for owners. Uh, and he's the chairman of your company. He's been leveraging technology and automation in traditionally ### FEATURED_COMPANY_DEEP_DIVES outdated industries to win share. GXO is a prime example of that, leading the industry in automation with over 40% of revenue from automated operations and more than 1500 uh 15,000 automated units and cobots already deployed across the network. We've long viewed GXO as one of the most underappreciated ways to play the broader automation and robotics theme. Where does GXO stand today relative to the rest of the industry? And how do you view automation as both a competitive differentiator and a key driver of scale? What are you seeing from customers in terms of interest and demand for automation within the sales pipeline? And uh lastly, as you continue moving uh toward more fully automated sites, how how should investors think about that margin uplift uh productivity improvements and customer stickiness that come with greater automation? And just as a dovetail uh on GXO Direct, which gives midsize customers access to the same technology and automation investments that would typically be out of reach, uh how would you describe that value proposition and how significant of an opportunity do you see for that platform as automation continues to scale across your customer base? Patrick, leadership starts at the top. Uh, GXO is a leader in technology and and I'm smiling based on your comments with Brad. Um, Brad Brad is always been a pioneer in technology. Technology features very high in all his businesses.    and position something uh that is uh more improved and can deliver a better result. It's integrated with our data lake uh and and that is a big part of how it deres its value uh is being able to access a very large data lake associated with those operations that we run. Uh and so for customers who come on board with GXO uh as we start up for you uh you're plugged into GXO IQ just as a process of being integrated with us then it is really about making sure that we're driving the deployment uh of those AI tools and continue to drive continuous improvement in those AI tools going forward. So, as said, we we've deployed to about 30 sites uh so far uh with plans in place in 2026 to accelerate that deployment. That's great.   Patrick, it it was nice to hear during the conference call that the the long- aaited Wington integration is now officially underway after a little hiccup there with the CMA.   Sounds great.\n\n### FEATURED_COMPANY_DEEP_DIVES\nI think this is the the quintessential AI beneficiary and robotics theme moving forward. All these technologies applied in real time.

You keep believing that and keep cutting rates. We love it.\" Uh, here's from my buddy Jose Torres over at Interactive Brokers. The senior economist talking about the uh Fed cut. Fed the central bank has seen its balance sheets shrink to a significant 2.43 43 trillion since its peak in April 2022. And now judges that reserves at financial institutions have dropped to ample levels which justify acquisitions of tea bills to ease funding stress in the system. Usage of the Fed's repo facility has begun to trend much higher in recent months. An indication that banks have too much government debt on their books and not enough cash. A condition signaling the potential for scarce reserves in the near future against the backdrop of rising fiscal issuance and liabilities. is a reversal from quantitative tightening to the addition of new fixed income instruments is kind of like QE and is music to the ears of stock bills as it bolsters liquidity conditions and adds fuel to the fire of some of the most speculative areas in equities. Indeed, folks, the small cap cyclically oriented Russell 2000 has reached a fresh all-time record for the second day in a row and all the major domestic benchmarks are advancing on the session. Guild curve is plunging in bull's deepening fashion leading south by monetary policy sensitive front end while today's accommodative tilt is sending commodities north due to stronger growth projections. Amen. Hallelujah. QE is back. Small cap stocks may be ready to outperform after 5 years of lagging. Amen. \n### FEATURED_COMPANY_DEEP_DIVES\nLet's get down to advanced auto parts update.

For anyone wanting to understand the key levers being pulled and why we have such strong conviction in this management team, the discussion is well worth the time. We're not going to play it here because we already had the 45minute interview with Patrick Keller, but you should definitely listen. It's well worth a while. We've highlighted the key points in the earnings results as well as the conference call. You want to go to hedge fun.com and do that. But here are the 10 key points. Advance delivered 2.04 04 billion in revenue, down 5% year-on-year, beating consensus by 13 million with the decline driven primarily by operating fewer stores after this year's footprint optimization that closed 700 underperforming locations, adjusted earnings of 92 cents, beat expectations by 18 cents, and compared to a loss of 5 cents in the same period last year, too. Comparable same store sales grew 3% for the quarter, landing at the high end of management's low singledigit guidance and accelerating from last quarters 10 basis points positive contributions from both the pro and DIY channels. Three, the pro channel delivered just over 4% comp growth in Q3, making it its fifth straight quarter of positive performance on a 2-year basis. Trends remain positive in Q4. So far with the new strategy gaining traction as store availability has improved to 96 to 97% from the prior low 90% range and time to serve has fallen by more than 10 minutes. The main street customer group the highest margin segment within pro still represents the single largest opportunity for the DIY channel delivered positive low singledigit comps during the quarter showing sequential improvement in transactions on both a one-year and two-year basis. Moving into Q4, management has seen more pressure on the consumer and some volatility in week-toeek transactions, but remains confident in the long-term outlook given the non-discretionary nature of the business with 90% of sales tied to repair and maintenance. Remember, the average car is 14 years old now. Five, the market hub strategy continued to progress with management now expecting to open 14 new market hubs this year compared to their prior expectations of only 10. They're still targeting 60 market hubs by mid2027 and expect to end the year at 33. These hubs carry 75 to 80,000 SKUs and provide same day parts availability to a service area of 60 to 90 stores which has driven a 100 basis point comp sales uplift to supported locations so far and creates incremental opportunities to gain market share. In addition, management expects to have 16 distribution centers by year end compared to 38 just two years ago, as well as open 30 new stores for the full year and still target at least 100 new openings over the next two years. 30 new stores and 100 new openings over the next two years. That is not a company in decline. That is a company that cleaned up a mess and is now back in growth mode. Expansion mode. Six. Advance has invested 50 million in store upgrades year to date, which include improved HVAC systems, roofing, parking lot, signage, and is more than double the total capex allocated to these projects last year. These upgrades cover more than 1400 store locations year-to- date compared to just 440 in 2024. Management expects capex to total 250 million for the year, lower than the prior 300 guidance due to timing shift into 2026. Seven, adjusted gross margins came in at 44.8%. 8% for the quarter, up 260 basis points from last year's 42.3. Adjusted operating margins, the most important metric in the AAP turnaround, came in at 4.4%, up 368 basis points year-on-year and the strongest quarterly performance in more than two years. Management remains confident in the 2027 target of 7% adjusted operating margins with street consensus still forecasting just 4.8% for 2027, a number we expect to move higher as it becomes obvious. Eight year-to- date free cash flow stands at an outflow of 277 million which includes 130 million of cash charges related to restructuring activities. Management expects fullear free cash flow to be an outl and 90 million and includes 150 million of cash charges. Backing these out, AAP would have delivered positive free cash flow for the year, giving management confidence in the ability to generate positive free cash flow in 2026 and beyond. Nine management narrowed and reaffirmed the midpoint of fullear guidance. Now expecting net sales at 8.55 to 8.6 compared billion compared to 8.4 to 8.6 which implies an upgrade of 750 million in sales. Comp sales growth is expected to be 7/10 of 1% to 1.3% and adjusted operating margin is projected to be between 2.4 and 2.6% 6% which implies more than 200 basis points of annual margin expansion in the first year of the turnaround plan. And 10 management views first brands as a one-off situation rather than a broader concern for the aftermarket industry. AAP currently sources less than 2% of cost of goods from the supplier with plenty of alternative options among the hundreds of vendors they already work with. Management recorded a non-cash charge of 28 million in cost of sales during the quarter to account for future credit losses on receivables from first brands and this will not affect fullear guidance.

Revenues are at all-time highs. Gross margins are at or near all-time highs. Uh priceto free cash flow multiple at or near all-time lows. And you can't give the stock away. We think that will change.

As we can see, free cash flow is near all-time highs. Revenues are at all-time highs. Gross margins are at or near all-time highs. Uh priceto free cash flow multiple at or near all-time lows. And you can't give the stock away. We think that will change. And here is  why. Here are the 10 key points from the most recent earnings call. Etsy delivered Q3 revenue of 687 678 million up 6.1% yearonear and ahead of Wall Street consensus by $21 million driven by a 12.7% increase in seller services revenue to 210 million while marketplace revenue declined 1.7 yearonear to 468 million. ETS's take rate of 24.9% came in ahead of guidance, expanding 220 basis points year-on-year and 90 basis points sequentially. Two, consolidated GMS came in at 2.72 billion, up 9/10 of 1% yearonear and above the top end of management's prior 2.6 to 2.7 billion guidance range. ETS's marketplace GMS totaled four 2.43 billion ahead of expectations and down 2.4% yearonear but improving by 300 basis points sequentially. GMS per active buyer on a trailing 12-month basis was 121 down 1.6 year-on-year percent but improving sequentially and continuing to show signs of stabilization. Three, continues to be a bright spot with gross merchandise sales of 992 million. I'm sorry. Uh gross merchandise sales of 292.1 million, up 39.4% 4% year-on-year, a 400 basis points acceleration from last quarter, driven by 59% gross merchandise sales growth in the US. Deep depot active sellers climbed 40.8% year-onear to 3 million and active buyers rose to 38.8% to 6.6 million. Depot is now tracking toward annualized run rate of $1 billion plus and management continues to see significant opportunity to scale it into a multi-billion dollar asset, launching the brand's first ever campaign during the quarter to further raise US awareness. Four, earlier in the quarter, Etsy signed a partnership with OpenAI to become the first live partner within chat GPT's instant checkout. This gives Etsy an early foothold in the fast growing agentic commerce channel with initial results looking promising. Early data suggests these buyers have higher purchase intent than traditional search, driving higher conversion rates and a noticeable spike in purchases from this traffic, albeit off a small base. Five, ETS's app now accounts for 46% of total gross merchandise sales, up from 42.8% last year with app-based GMS growing 5% year-on-year and outperforming non-app GMS by 13 percentage points. The app continues to drive higher engagement and purchase frequency with app users generating 5x more visits, viewing 3x more pages per visit, and being 1.5x more likely to convert. Six, consolidated adjusted ebida margins came in at 24.5.4% for the quarter, in line with management's prior 25% guidance, but below last year's 27.7%. The margin pressure is primarily tied to increased marketing investment at depot. While the Etsy marketplace continues to post margins just shy of 30%, consolidated marketing spend increased 6% year-on-year to 208 million or 30.7% of revenue and is expected to remain elevated into the first half of 2026. 7 management repurchased 2.1 million shares during the quarter for a total of 120 million at an average price of 5714. Over the past 3 years, Etsy has reduced its share count by 21.5% through 2.47 billion in buybacks, making our slice of the pie that much bigger without putting up any additional capital. The current repurchase program still has 356 million remaining, 6.6% of the total market cap, leaving plenty of dry powder for continued to buybacks, supported by 1.6 billion of cash on the balance sheet. Look at these repurchases. It's through the roof and shares outstanding down 21%. Eight. Etsy announced that longtime CEO Josh Silverman will step down after more than eight years and transition to executive chair through the end of 2026. Cruy Patel Goyal will assume the CEO role at the start of 2026. She has been with Etsy for more than 15 years, spent two years as Depop CEO, where all the growth is, where GMS and the buyer base nearly doubled, and most recently served as ETS's president and chief growth officer. Nine, Etsy generated 205 million in free cash flow during the quarter, bringing trailing 12 months free cash flow to 635 million, 12% of market cap, and converting 83% of adjusted EBID into free cash flow. and 10 management guided Q4 GMS to 3.5 to 3.65 billion with the midpoint implying further sequential improvement in the combined Etsy marketplace and depot year-on-year growth rate despite an uncertain consumer backdrop. The Q4 take rate is expected to be 24.5% with adjusted EBA margins under pressure at 24% driven primarily by the significant sequential increase in depot brand marketing during the holiday season.",

He had a 38 bagger while he ran the small business unit at into it. Margins are increasing. Revenues are reacelerating. No one is paying attention. 30 seconds. And this is going to be this is going to be a great stock over the next two years. The hand is down. You don't pound the table confidence on that one. Thanks. All right, let's see what we got now. Look at Meta, Tom. This is for you. Look at that 4% gain for Meta. Tell me more. You know, Charlie Mer once said, \"I'm all for artificial intelligence because natural intelligence is so rare.\" Uh here's an example with Meta. The stock is up. The market likes it. They're cutting their spend on the metaverse, which was a flop. They're investing in AI. The market likes it. The stock's going to continue to follow the theme. All right, Tom. Thank you. Thank you, Lauren. And thank you Tom Hayes for being with me for the hour. I appreciate that. And we're back. And then I had the pleasure to join David Aman also on Varnney and co-f Fox Business. Thanks to Payton Jennings just yesterday before the Fed meeting. We'll listen in here. Meanwhile, Thomas Hayes joins me now. Thomas, great to see you. The Fed of course is expected to cut about a quarter of a percent today. Uh there's I think a 90% chance that's going to happen. But the question is how Powell answers questions  and whether or not he's going to cap any further rate cuts uh to some very strict limitations. What do you think the market's going to make of it? Well, I think that's exactly right, David. We will get a cut today. The question is the rhetoric and more importantly the summary of economic projections in September. The projections implied we would get a cut in December and then only one more cut in 2026. market doesn't want to see that again. They want to see at least two cuts in 2026. So, if there's no change in the summary of economic projections, the market might not be happy in the very short term. But have no fear, David, because Santa is here. The Santa Claus rally historically starts since 1950 on the 14th or 15th of December. The reason for that, David, is because of individual tax law selling. So most individuals spend the first two weeks of December selling off their losers. The stocks that did not work for the year and in this year the stocks that did not work were defensive stocks, dividend payers like consumer staples, healthc care, the boring stocks and dividend payers, which by the way work extremely well in an easing cycle. So we've got a couple of those for you. Well, and one of them is Papa John's. Why do you like it? Papa John's 4 and a.5% dividend yield. New CEO came from Wendy's. He ran Wendy's from 2016 to 2024. Had a threebagger when he was turning that around. Comp Store sales are up 2%. They're re franchising 85 units which is adding to free cash flow. They took guidance up and everyone loves pizza. It's a no-brainer. And by the way, as you were talking, it went from red into the green. It's now up a quarter of a percent. Hormel is entering a phase of growth. Why is that? Another dividend payer. The highest yield we've seen in a long time. They've been paying a dividend every single year since 1928, David. And for the last 60 years, it's been a dividend aristocrat, which means it raised the dividend every single year. So, not only do you lock in a 5% dividend yield, but odds are it's going to go up every single year. They've got a whole suite that's right in line with the GLP1 theme high protein snacks from the sausages to the spam to the stew to the planters peanuts to the Skippy etc. Uh this thing is now reacelerating. Some of the tariffs on food have been rolled back. Uh it's a strong healthy dividend and we think this defensive dividend payer is going to do well in a midterm election year which tends to be volatile. Tom Hayes, great information. Thank you so much for being here. Have a wonderful holiday. Let's get back to this survey that shows and we're back. And now for the grand finale, we had the CEO of GXO Logistics on our podcast one- on-one interview. Absolutely incredible interview. You're going to want to listen in here. Why? Because GXO is the embodiment of playing the AI beneficiaries that will have margin expansion and increased productivity as a result of utilizing the tool versus the hyperscalers whose capex is now higher uh than big oil. Okay. Uh capex as a percentage of operating cash flow uh margin compression. They are the spenders. We are the beneficiaries and GXO embodies that.

Well, I'm Tom Hayes, chairman and managing member of Great Hill Capital, and we have an extremely special guest on today on Hedge Fund Tips with Tom Hayes, the CEO of GXO Logistics, Mr. Patrick Keller. Patrick, thank you so much for coming on today. Absolutely, Tom. Thank you for having me. Well, everyone knows uh we we talk about companies that we own. We've had a nicesized position in your company for some time. Uh, and let's get right down to the\n\n We are planning uh an investor day in 2026, a date to be announced and we're going to share a lot of details uh on each of those pillars in terms of our path forward over the next three years. Well, it's great to hear that Patrick and you know you hear so much noise about AI is going to increase productivity and margins and humanoid robots and honestly the only company that I can see already doing it and already implementing this technology way ahead of the curve is GXO. So that's really really promising. Uh, switching gears to another value added service that GXO offers, I'd love to touch on reverse logistics and the long-term opportunity in that space. Uh, in traditional brick-andmortar retail, only about 1 in 10 items are typically returned, but that number jumps to nearly 1 in three for ecommerce. A lot of people don't know that. Uh, for retailers, outsourcing reverse logistics seems like a no-brainer. GXO has cited that roughly 96% of returns processed through its network are returned to stock compared with an industry average of about 25% of items uh ending up in landfills. So, not only is this an attractive opportunity from a cost-saving perspective for retailers, all you retailers listening into my call, you need to reach out to Patrick. Uh but it's also a lucrative higher margin segment for GXO with these contracts carrying significantly higher margins uh and revenue multipliers compared to standard contracts without these services. Could you first speak to how large you think this opportunity could become as e-commerce continues to expand its share of the overall retail pie? Uh why do you think more omni channel channel retailers haven't yet outsourced their reverse logistics given the clear cost and operational benefits? And finally , how should investors think about the margin profile of these contracts and their role in driving a structurally higher margin base for GXO over time? Sure. The the uh the third party logistics market for reverse logistics is really exciting. I think total addressable markets now about $60 billion last I heard. It is a service that is embedded in what we do for customers today. Uh leveraging our process expertise. We've deployed AI in this area by the way as uh medium to try and capture the highest value for return products for our customers as they look to either return product to stock or put those product out to the resale market. We we acquired a really great business called Service Tech with the Clipper acquisition in which we're actually doing repair of iPads, cell phones. Um I've seen expensive Italian coffee machines being repaired. And that's all a great way in terms of how we're increasing the margins for our customer of the resale of those products and the capture of the value of product that is being returned. uh and we in turn are being rewarded with uh good margins on the provision of those services. One of the things that really excites me about this space is the competencies that we have in the retail and e-commerce space which we execute so well uh have high application in the B2B space and today we are managing cell phone returns at at a very high scale. Um a lot of regulation in Europe is uh is really driving uh customer interest in solutions for returns because of regulatory requirements that have to be met and that is going to be a real catalyst for growth and it's been fascinating to see in the data center work that we're doing where we are performing services in support of the sustainment and maintenance of data centers t",

Let's take a look. Revenues and free cash flow are headed in the wrong direction, hence the stock. Margins are starting to improve. Looks like the business has been deteriorating for a while. Uh let's take a look at financial analysis here. Find me some balance sheet maybe. There we go. Let's take a look at that first. See if you've got enough time to wait out any turnaround on this name. You're going to have to find out what's the management's plan to turn it around because see, so they got 400 million of cash, half a billion of receivables, debt is 2.8 probably. Okay. Okay, free cash flow is 135. Let's take a look at income. Take a look at quarterly. See what's happening there. Seems like it's trying to recover a little bit. kept the share count pretty steady. I look I think it's worth doing some more work on. Um it wouldn't be my f first choice in the uh chemicals area, but I think you're on to something. So go listen to the last eight calls, understand the turnaround plan. What did they say they were going to do? What have they done? What's the catalyst for change? And I think you might have something there.\nEric C, I do not know how people complain about your podcast being long. Most don't. The losers do, but it is what it is. I believe they are too short.

That takes another hour. So, um you could just listen to the podcast part number one. And I said, listen, just listen. You know, if two hours is too long, just listen to 10% and you'll get 10% of the value. What else do you want to tell me? You know, I'm going to give the value where people want it. And uh uh but as far as General Mills goes, let's go here. G I S. You know, there was a story in the Bible complaining on the way to the promised land. Trip cancelled. Okay. God could only take so much. Complaining on the way to the promised land. Just cancel the trip. All right. Uh let's see. So revenues and free cash flow have been under pressure. So, the stock is down uh about 50%. I think you're got no problems here buying this. Let's see here. Subdued multiple dividend yield. I mean, this this strikes it on all fronts. I don't think you're going to get hurt with this. Uh so, go for it. I I look, if you can get it at $40, great. But 45, buy some now. Buy some more at 40 and then just hang on to it for a few years. I think you're going to be fine. I love it, Eric. And you're making money because you're listening to the whole thing. All right.

Um, by the way, you always get these stupid\n\nUh, how did you predict that 10-year yield was going below five and you were calling for a three handle? How'd you have that?

Balance sheet 2.6 billion, 3.7 billion receivables and uh long-term debt at 21. Uh, you know, we understand the cap table. We understand how much cash they generate.

It's a it's a massive overshoot. people still drink. They're gonna drink I I don't want the mass market stuff because people that are overweight probably drink a ton of beer and the cheaper stuff and now that they're on GLPs, they're drinking less.

Uh we love this story and uh we're sticking to it. \n### ASK_ME_ANYTHING_QA\nYesterday we got two questions on Dagio because the stock was down. Um, Lucas Tangrove, what do you think of Hunts? H, that's Huntsman's company Chemicals. I think I like it. Let me just take a quick look and confirm that. Yeah, I've looked at this one and I do like it. I think a lot of opportunity in the chemical companies. Okay, there we go. That family will turn it around. They know how to run the business. Look, it's I mean, there's no imminent sign of a turnaround. So, I would definitely get on the calls before you do anything, but they will fix it when the cycle turns. They have the operating leverage. I think it's a good company, uh, run by a good group, and you're going to make some money off of that for sure. let's just make sure that the balance sheet is not going to smoke you in the meantime. And the answer is no. They've paid down a bunch of debt and they still are generating ample free cash flow. So, uh, like that one. Good job, Lucas. On to the next. Matthew Tumbo. Uh, how do you approach tax loss harving? This is uh this is tax loss. Haring harvesting is for gamblers that think they can time the market. We covered the um we covered if you're out the the best 10 days and often times you sell in the first two weeks of December to tax loss harvest when everyone else is selling. And what happens to all those losers is they get bid huge uh at the end of December and the first two weeks of January, which you can't replace in inside of the 30 days for wash sale rules. So bottom line is if you're a gambler and like, oh, my trading thing went wrong and therefore I'm going to take my losses and and like try to pretend that it's a win because you screwed up. Uh have at it. But if you're owning a piece of the business and you're going to gamble that you can get out for 30 days, take the tax benefit and get back in 30 days from now, I mean, good luck with that nonsense. At the end of the day, own the business and sell it when it's fully valued and call it a day. Like, uh, I know that your typical financial advisor is going to say, \"This is the value ad we provide. We're gonna harvest all your losses.\" How about not having massive losses? how why don't you try that? Um, you know, and um my suggestion is don't have a ton of losses and if you have a company that's taking longer to realize full value, just sit on your hands and wait. Stop trying to be so cute about everything all the time to save a few pennies on taxes. Every time I've ever waited till January to take the taxes into the next year or done tax loss harvesting, it always backfires. either the stock tanks because everyone was doing it, waiting till January 1st to sell the big winner or uh I sell it in the hole in December and it runs away by mid January and I missed 10 15% of the move. It's never worth it. Uh if you're underwriting these businesses properly, if you're trading and gambling, yeah, take all your losses. I'm sure you have plenty of them. Alex Trick, uh just discovered the podcast a few weeks ago. Already a big fan. I love that. added your pod to a weekly finance call with a friend to discuss and learn from. Curious about your take on DGXX. Uh, Digit Power Inc. Well, welcome. Um, you are probably early in the learning curve. I would go back and listen to a bunch of other episodes so you can start to learn the framework a little bit better. But, uh, this is still negative free cash flow. We're not interested in those type of businesses. But um appreciate you sending it. Uh yeah, this is data center. This is this is short-term shiny object stuff. It might work, but it's gambling and we don't do that here. So, um keep listening in. You're going to learn a ton. And then if you still want to play these spec plays, uh shiny object theme plays, flavor of the month, Wall Street fashion show stuff, you can do that with a small amount of your gambling money. But the investing money, buying pieces of great businesses at good businesses at great prices, that's what we do. Uh, good businesses at great prices versus great businesses at good prices. When Buffett had his greatest performance of his career, when he was running the partnerships, he bought good businesses at great prices. When he had free float from the insurance companies and a permanent capital vehicle, he started buying great businesses at good prices because he had a lot more money to put to work. But the performance suffered over the long term uh relative to when he was buying good business at great prices. So on the one hand, Charlie quote unquote educated him. On the other hand, Charlie led to his underperformance. Uh but also the law of large numbers impacted that as well. Paul Smith, I got that. Thank you for that. Uh Cameron Hector, I'd love your take on buy now pay later. blah blah blah. Uh yeah, look, Cameron, uh let's see. Uh source of potential consumer leverage analogist on a smaller mortgage buildup. Okay, it's not going to get anywhere near the mortgage build buildup. Uh but it is going to get flushed at some point. So, how's your view shape the way you think about consumer discretionary stocks that lean on buy now pay later? Uh PayPal specifically, I've been a listener since the COVID lows. You've helped my account significantly and made investing feel both fun and peaceful at the same time. Thank you, Cameron. Well, Cameron, you are a longtime listener, first- time caller. Thank you for being around that long. Glad your account is up big. Um, I hate buy now pay later. I think it's a uh crappy product that works until it doesn't. and um it's small enough in the scheme of PayPal that it will be beneficial in the long term. They did a good job of selling off a lot of their portfolio. So, I hope they continue to initiate it and sell it off to suckers because sooner or later the chickens come home to roost. It's a lowquality business, but it's high growth when it works and it's high margin when it works. just lay it off like all the smart people did during the housing crisis is they would originate and lay off to suckers and hopefully PayPal will do the same as they have been so far. Adam F question on PayPal. Same thing. I can tell you that I can look at a chart of PayPal and Dagio and if it was read that day, we'll have three AMAs on PayPal and Dagio and it's perfect metaphor for the psychology of an investor looking at day-to-day ticks.

Uh I think they're at further uh concern with the um advent of AI. A lot of this stuff can be done without them. This is a broken Momo stock. And uh you know, if I owned it, would I be selling here? Probably not. But would I be encouraged to be a buyer here? The answer is no. Uh Tom F. Blooming Brands turn around. Yeah, I looked at this one. We ultimately passed on it uh for uh Papa John's. Uh but I think you'll probably be okay here. I uh let me just try to understand. Let me take a look at the balance sheet. I think the whole group is going to be good in 2026, which is counterintuitive annual. So, I got 100 million of free cash flow. share accounts come down balance sheet. That's your issue? 250 million and then they've got how much debt? Well, they paid down the debt a little bit. I think it's a levered play. I think the other aspect was I just think their product is Let's see. Blue and Brands. No, Bonefish Grill. Yeah, I think you're okay. I think you're okay here. I kind of like this one. It was just a little too risky for me, but um when the group works, you'll probably have a threeagger and I'll have a two bagger. So, you may win on this, but you have a lot more risk than I do at Papa John's. So, there's that. Uh, evaluate UHT, Universal Health Realy Income Trust. Uh yeah, I hate the medical property reats because they always seem to screw up something. Uh I just avoid them. I I'm telling you, if you're going to have negative surprises in the REIT space, it's always going to be in the medical property reats. I just avoid them as a rule. I would suggest you do the same. And you know, the difference between you and me is when God was handing out FOMO jeans, he didn't give it to me. So if uh doubles over the next six months, I don't give a like it doesn't bother me in one way whatsoever that I missed it because the down number one is don't rule number one don't lose money rule number two don't forget rule number one and these medical properties they always figure out a way to screw it up so Bill C ETF PSC we don't do a lot on ETFs um PSC small cap healthcare yeah why not I'd rather pick companies. I know you already picked out Fizer. Was wondering you could look at AKBA. I'll bet there's a lot of dilution in this stock without even looking at it. Ah, it's a biotech. We don't do individual biotechs. Our our biotech basket has been a home run by the way. Still free cash flow negative. Let me just see how piggy this management has been. Uh yeah, there's a place in hell reserved for management that does this to their owners. So they've increased the share count from 118 million to 245. Uh no thank you. on to the next. Matt says, \"Been watching for over five years and haven't missed even one minute. Until this week, I was not sure whether your everinccreasing use of frank speech and slightly stronger language was improving the content.

All right. Brent Lamour. Uh, uh, he's asking about Weeble because they're trading they're changing the day trader rule to 2,000 instead of 25,000 so more people can gamble away the little money they have. Um. Uh, Weeble. Yeah. I not for me. I I don't like it. I No. Chris, it's like benefiting from people doing heroin. It's like not for me. Chris Williamson, do can you I said the guy who owns Dagio, but okay. I understand the hypocrisy. Can you do a brief look at Marquetta, ticker MQ? Okay. MQ uh cloud-based open API platform for card issuing. Yeah, the problem is it it does look okay, but um what is their moat? It's crowded. I I'd just rather play a sureer thing, which is the case with PayPal if I'm going to be in the space at all. Um they have scale, they have cash flow. Just see what's going on here. Look at this stock compensation. What a bunch of animals. All right. And the share count. Increase the share count from 100 million to 500 million. Even if their business works, they're going to f you. So dump it on their heads. Let them have it themselves and dilute themselves till the cows come home. Giant Patel listening for six months. Got to know about you from your interview in Cooper Standard website.

Those revenues are not showing any signs of recovering yet. Meal kit provider. No, forget that stuff. That's co. Skip it. Mias Hambook. Whirlpool. We keep looking at Whirlpool. Um, it's a play on rates and the housing market. So, probably, but we've not seen any signs of turning the corner yet. I mean, revenues have just collapsed. I mean, the numbers are so bad on this stock that like I I I almost think that their product has gone to crap. But let me just see here. Cash cash flow annual Free cash flow has deteriorated quite a bit. Um I mean, they're just not they're not really showing signs of turning the corner, but I think I think it's going to work. I I kind of like it. I I just wouldn't do it for clients because I would listen to the last eight calls, see if see if they're got any plans to turn around. And um you know, as far as what you're saying about temper, I don't buy things on the basis of someone else buying them. I buy it on the basis of me wanting to own the whole business. The filters being if JP Morgan was going to finance me to buy the entire business, I'd had to be 100% of my net worth as the equity slug. So, if it worked, I made 20x. If it didn't work, I went to apply for a job at Walmart Greeter. I wouldn't do that with this stock. I wouldn't put 100% of my net worth into it. But, I do think it's going to work and I like the I like the pick and I'm I'm bullish on uh rates and housing and housing in terms of home builders uh and that whole game coming back on. But we're going to benefit on it through uh Generrack and Stanley Black & Decker and some others that we can sleep like a baby. Molina, we haven't done anything because of the Medicaid risk, but it's probably going to work as well. Uh but it's not for us.",
    "### MISCELLANEOUS": "\n\nwhich is which is a a healthy market from a profitability perspective as well as driving our presence in the B2B verticals which come with more complex supply chain solutions, higher risk and execution uh and therefore higher reward and profitability of the solutions that we sell in those areas. Uh so from a portfolio perspective on organic growth we expect a benefit on margin expansion and driving towards that. The other is uh on operational execution and our operational excellence agenda. I recently announced uh that we would be hiring uh and and have now identified an individual to be announced shortly as the global chief operating officer. That individual is focused on looking at our business through a global lens because I believe the level of M&A that the business has done over the last four years. The business at GXO has been run as uh regional silos really not looking yet at at the business from a global perspective and how we can leverage our scale in the best way possible. The new global COO is a big part of putting that global lens on the business in really two dimensions. One is from a labor productivity perspective making sure that we've deployed the best tools to drive the best productivity uh and the best underlying labor cost. doing that in a consistent way around what I would call the GXO way uh globally across our 1,200 plus operations and we believe there's uh labor savings opportunities there uh where we can benefit from margin expansion our customers can benefit from lower cost the second is around technology and we continue to be a leader in automation and warehouse robotics AI now humanoids um we are driving towards making sure that we're working with the right partners that the solutions that we're deploying deliver ROI and accelerating the pace in which we're getting these solutions into the hands of our customers to create value for them and to drive margin expansion in our business. And then\nfinally  from an SGNA perspective uh we we think we have the uh the teams in place in order to be successful uh and we continue to drive particularly looking through a global lens. Where can we leverage our global scale around procurement uh as an example to make sure that we get the best leverage of our SGNA uh for margin expansion as we go forward. We are planning uh an investor day in 2026, a date to be announced and we're going to share a lot of details uh on each of those pillars in terms of our path forward over the next three years. Well, it's great to hear that Patrick and you know you hear so much noise about AI is going to increase productivity and margins and humanoid robots and honestly the only company that I can see already doing it and already implementing this technology way ahead of the curve is GXO. So that's really really promising. Uh, switching gears to another value added service that GXO offers, I'd love to touch on reverse logistics and the long-term opportunity in that space. Uh, in traditional brick-andmortar retail, only about 1 in 10 items are typically returned, but that number jumps to nearly 1 in three for ecommerce. A lot of people don't know that. Uh, for retailers, outsourcing reverse logistics seems like a no-brainer. GXO has cited that roughly 96% of returns processed through its network are returned to stock compared with an industry average of about 25% of items uh ending up in landfills. So, not only is this an attractive opportunity from a cost-saving perspective for retailers, all you retailers listening into my call, you need to reach out to Patrick. Uh but it's also a lucrative higher margin segment for GXO with these contracts carrying significantly higher margins uh and revenue multipliers compared to standard contracts without these services. Could you first speak to how large you think this opportunity could become as e-commerce continues to expand its share of the overall retail pie? Uh why do you think more omni channel channel retailers haven't yet outsourced their reverse logistics given the clear cost and operational benefits? And\n\nStocks are also rebounding. We love it. Monetary conditions for most of the economy are still tight. So that is we are in an easing cycle. Dividend payers are going to dramatically benefit. Just look out through history. And you know that helps the Stanley's, that helps the Papa John's, that helps the Fizers, that helps the Hormel's dividend aristocrat paying for 60 plus years and so on so forth. Moving right along, Wall Street forecast for 2026, Bank of America is the least bullish and Deutsche Bank, an European bank is the most bullish. That is something you don't see every day. Consumer staples relative to S&P all-time low. This is the time of your life to buy this. You haven't seen, by the way, this is how Warren Buffett had a few of his best years ever from 2000 to 2004 in terms of performance when the NASDAQ crashed 90% 80 90% names like Amazon etc. While those were crashing, Buffett had record performance because he was buying all these staples that no one wanted in 2000. And then as tech rolled over, he made money like crazy. Similar things will be in the future. I don't think we're going to see massive crashes in tech at all, but I do think we're going to see outperformance of these defensives and dividend payers in 2026.

The average deal cycle time in the contract logistics industry is 6 to9 months. So, uh, the conversion of that pipeline, uh, will come in in the middle of 26 and we'll see that, uh, but for me, I'm super excited, uh, about the revenue synergies that come here and how that can underpin our organic growth priority as we're moving forward into 2026 and going forward.\n### MISCELLANEOUS\nWell, Patrick, this has been really really helpful to all the investors out there for sure. Uh just want to encourage people to listen in to the quarterly conference calls. go to the website, go to the investor relations, see all the documentation and and the plan because this is going to be a phenomenal story. And I think this is the the quintessential AI beneficiary and robotics theme moving forward. All these technologies applied in real time. GXO is ahead of the curve and the good days are just beginning. So\n\nHelloFresh uh HFG Hello Group. Let's see. HFG I don't know. Those revenues are not showing any signs of recovering yet. Meal kit provider. No, forget that stuff. That's co. Skip it. Mias Hambook. Whirlpool. We keep looking at Whirlpool. Um, it's a play on rates and the housing market. So, probably, but we've not seen any signs of turning the corner yet. I mean, revenues have just collapsed. I mean, the numbers are so bad on this stock that like I I I almost think that their product has gone to crap. But let me just see here. Cash cash flow annual Free cash flow has deteriorated quite a bit. Um I mean, they're just not they're not really showing signs of turning the corner, but I think I think it's going to work. I I kind of like it. I I just wouldn't do it for clients because I would listen to the last eight calls, see if see if they're got any plans to turn around. And um you know, as far as what you're saying about temper, I don't buy things on the basis of someone else buying them. I buy it on the basis of me wanting to own the whole business. The filters being if JP Morgan was going to finance me to buy the entire business, I'd had to be 100% of my net worth as the equity slug. So, if it worked, I made 20x. If it didn't work, I went to apply for a job at Walmart Greeter. I wouldn't do that with this stock. I wouldn't put 100% of my net worth into it. But, I do think it's going to work and I like the I like the pick and I'm I'm bullish on uh rates and housing and housing in terms of home builders uh and that whole game coming back on. But we're going to benefit on it through uh Generrack and Stanley Black & Decker and some others that we can sleep like a baby.

This year they got Papa John's. We try to give them something from the portfolio each year and help earnings power. Uh I had one uh smart alec send me an email.

This is what we're talking about ladies and gentlemen why we had to get some discretionary. Everyone's getting out. We be getting in as they say in the uh neighborhood.

AI beneficiaries versus AI cost centers all day long. The outlook for US GDP growth has improved. Discretionary investors are implicitly pricing in a sharp slowing in earnings growth. Good luck with that, ladies and gentlemen, because if the Supreme Court votes against the tariffs, not only will Trump find a way to keep the tariffs going in the intermediate term, but in the short term versus returning that money to the foreign countries, he will take that money and dividend it out as a check to US taxpayers. And I'm going to tell you that the people who received the $2,000 checks are going to be using it to buy Papa John's pizza and vans. So, that would be a great thing, not a bad thing.

Fed the central bank has seen its balance sheets shrink to a significant 2.43 43 trillion since its peak in April 2022. And now judges that reserves at financial institutions have dropped to ample levels which justify acquisitions of tea bills to ease funding stress in the system. Usage of the Fed's repo facility has begun to trend much higher in recent months. An indication that banks have too much government debt on their books and not enough cash. A condition signaling the potential for scarce reserves in the near future against the backdrop of rising fiscal issuance and liabilities. is a reversal from quantitative tightening to the addition of new fixed income instruments is kind of like QE and is music to the ears of stock bills as it bolsters liquidity conditions and adds fuel to the fire of some of the most speculative areas in equities. Indeed, folks, the small cap cyclally oriented Russell 2000 has reached a fresh all-time record for the second day in a row and all the major domestic benchmarks are advancing on the session. Guild curve is plunging in bull's deepening fashion leading south by monetary policy sensitive front end while today's accommodative tilt is sending commodities north due to stronger growth projections. Amen. Hallelujah. QE is back. Small cap stocks may be ready to outperform after 5 years of lagging. Amen. Jacob Sun and Shine over at Barons. Hope you're doing well.

Um, by the way, you always get these stupid questions  when the stock is down on the day. It obviously came in yesterday when the stock was down. Um, but let's just answer the question. And so, Dagio is generating 2.7 billion of free cash flow. Uh, there's certainly some leverage. It's a valid concern, but this is one of the best in class and it will benefit from treat people drinking less and drinking better. Um, so",

I think it's a uh crappy product that works until it doesn't. and um it's small enough in the scheme of PayPal that it will be beneficial in the long term.

Cash cash flow annual Free cash flow has deteriorated quite a bit. Um I mean, they're just not they're not really showing signs of turning the corner, but I think I think it's going to work. I I kind of like it. I I just wouldn't do it for clients because I would listen to the last eight calls, see if see if they're got any plans to turn around. And um you know, as far as what you're saying about temper, I don't buy things on the basis of someone else buying them. I buy it on the basis of me wanting to own the whole business. The filters being if JP Morgan was going to finance me to buy the entire business, I'd had to be 100% of my net worth as the equity slug. So, if it worked, I made 20x. If it didn't work, I went to apply for a job at Walmart Greeter. I wouldn't do that with this stock. I wouldn't put 100% of my net worth into it.

A few weeks ago, Okelly and CFO Ryan Grimsland gave an excellent highlevel update on the turnaround's progress and fielded investor\nquestions  at the Gabelli Fund's 49th annual automotive aftermarket symposium. For anyone wanting to understand the key levers being pulled and why we have such strong conviction in this management team, the discussion is well worth the time. We're not going to play it here because we already had the 45minute interview with Patrick Keller, but you should definitely listen. It's well worth a while. We've highlighted the key points in the earnings results as well as the conference call. You want to go to hedge fun.com and do that. But here are the 10 key points. Advance delivered 2.04 04 billion in revenue, down 5% year-on-year, beating consensus by 13 million with the decline driven primarily by operating fewer stores after this year's footprint optimization that closed 700 underperforming locations, adjusted earnings of 92 cents, beat expectations by 18 cents, and compared to a loss of 5 cents in the same period last year, too. Comparable same store sales grew 3% for the quarter, landing at the high end of management's low singledigit guidance and accelerating from last quarters 10 basis points positive contributions from both the pro and DIY channels. Three, the pro channel delivered just over 4% comp growth in Q3, making it its fifth straight quarter of positive performance on a 2-year basis.",
      "Backing these out, AAP would have delivered positive free cash flow for the year, giving management confidence in the ability to generate positive free cash flow in 2026 and beyond. Nine management narrowed and reaffirmed the midpoint of fullear guidance. Now expecting net sales at 8.55 to 8.6 compared billion compared to 8.4 to 8.6 which implies an upgrade of 750 million in sales. Comp sales growth is expected to be 7/10 of 1% to 1.3% and adjusted operating margin is projected to be between 2.4 and 2.6% 6% which implies more than 200 basis points of annual margin expansion in the first year of the turnaround plan. And 10 management views first brands as a one-off situation rather than a broader concern for the aftermarket industry. AAP currently sources less than 2% of cost of goods from the supplier with plenty of alternative options among the hundreds of vendors they already work with. Management recorded a non-cash charge of 28 million in cost of sales during the quarter to account for future credit losses on receivables from first brands and this will not affect fullear guidance."

GMS per active buyer on a trailing 12-month basis was 121 down 1.6 year-on-year percent but improving sequentially and continuing to show signs of stabilization. Three, continues to be a bright spot with gross merchandise sales of 992 million. I'm sorry. Uh gross merchandise sales of 292.1 million, up 39.4% 4% year-on-year, a 400 basis points acceleration from last quarter, driven by 59% gross merchandise sales growth in the US. Deep depot active sellers climbed 40.8% year-onear to 3 million and active buyers rose to 38.8% to 6.6 million. Depot is now tracking toward annualized run rate of $1 billion plus and management continues to see significant opportunity to scale it into a multi-billion dollar asset, launching the brand's first ever campaign during the quarter to further raise US awareness. Four, earlier in the quarter, Etsy signed a partnership with OpenAI to become the first live partner within chat GPT's instant checkout. This gives Etsy an early foothold in the fast growing agentic commerce channel with initial results looking promising. Early data suggests these buyers have higher purchase intent than traditional search, driving higher conversion rates and a noticeable spike in purchases from this traffic, albeit off a small base. Five, ETS's app now accounts for 46% of total gross merchandise sales, up from 42.8% last year with app-based GMS growing 5% year-on-year and outperforming non-app GMS by 13 percentage points. The app continues to drive higher engagement and purchase frequency with app users generating 5x more visits, viewing 3x more pages per visit, and being 1.5x more likely to convert. Six, consolidated adjusted ebida margins came in at 24.5.4% for the quarter, in line with management's prior 25% guidance, but below last year's 27.7%. The margin pressure is primarily tied to increased marketing investment at depot. While the Etsy marketplace continues to post margins just shy of 30%, consolidated marketing spend increased 6% year-on-year to 208 million or 30.7% of revenue and is expected to remain elevated into the first half of 2026. 7 management repurchased 2.1 million shares during the quarter for a total of 120 million at an average price of 5714. Over the past 3 years, Etsy has reduced its share count by 21.5% through 2.47 billion in buybacks, making our slice of the pie that much bigger without putting up any additional capital. The current repurchase program still has 356 million remaining, 6.6% of the total market cap, leaving plenty of dry powder for continued to buybacks, supported by 1.6 billion of cash on the balance sheet. Look at these repurchases. It's through the roof and shares outstanding down 21%. Eight. Etsy announced that longtime CEO Josh Silverman will step down after more than eight years and transition to executive chair through the end of 2026. Cruy Patel Goyal will assume the CEO role at the start of 2026. She has been with Etsy for more than 15 years, spent two years as Depop CEO, where all the growth is, where GMS and the buyer base nearly doubled, and most recently served as ETS's president and chief growth officer. Nine, Etsy generated 205 million in free cash flow during the quarter, bringing trailing 12 months free cash flow to 635 million, 12% of market cap, and converting 83% of adjusted EBID into free cash flow. and 10 management guided Q4 GMS to 3.5 to 3.65 billion with the midpoint implying further sequential improvement in the combined Etsy marketplace and depot year-on-year growth rate despite an uncertain consumer backdrop. The Q4 take rate is expected to be 24.5% with adjusted EBA margins under pressure at 24% driven primarily by the significant sequential increase in depot brand marketing during the holiday season."

I can tell you that I can look at a chart of PayPal and Dagio and if it was read that day, we'll have three AMAs on PayPal and Dagio and it's perfect metaphor for the psychology of an investor looking at day-to-day ticks. Why would your view of a stock or a company ownership change just because it is a red tick on that day versus when it's a green trick? If I if the stock shot up to $80, we'd have no",
      "They're going to drink better. Dagio's perfectly positioned. It was mismanaged. Now they have an adult in the room. Uh we love this story and uh we're sticking to it. Jose Tim D. Oh, of course. Yesterday we got two questions on Dagio because the stock was down. Um, Lucas Tangrove, what do you think of Hunts? H, that's Huntsman's company Chemicals. I think I like it. Let me just take a quick look and confirm that. Yeah, I've looked at this one and I do like it. I think a lot of opportunity in the chemical companies. Okay, there we go. That family will turn it around. They know how to run the business. Look, it's I mean, there's no imminent sign of a turnaround. So, I would definitely get on the calls before you do anything, but they will fix it when the cycle turns. They have the operating leverage. I think it's a good company, uh, run by a good group, and you're going to make some money off of that for sure. let's just make sure that the balance sheet is not going to smoke you in the meantime. And the answer is no. They've paid down a bunch of debt and they still are generating ample free cash flow. So, uh, like that one. Good job, Lucas. On to the next. Matthew Tumbo. Uh, how do you approach tax loss harving? This is uh this is tax loss. Haring harvesting is for gamblers that think they can time the market. We covered the um we covered if you're out the the best 10 days and often times you sell in the first two weeks of December to tax loss harvest when everyone else is selling. And what happens to all those losers is they get bid huge uh at the end of December and the first two weeks of January, which you can't replace in inside of the 30 days for wash sale rules. So bottom line is if you're a gambler and like, oh, my trading thing went wrong and therefore I'm going to take my losses and and like try to pretend that it's a win because you screwed up. Uh have at it. But if you're owning a piece of the business and you're going to gamble that you can get out for 30 days, take the tax benefit and get back in 30 days from now, I mean, good luck with that nonsense. At the end of the day, own the business and sell it when it's fully valued and call it a day. Like, uh, I know that your typical financial advisor is going to say, \"This is the value ad we provide. We're gonna harvest all your losses.\" How about not having massive losses? how why don't you try that? Um, you know, and um my suggestion is don't have a ton of losses and if you have a company that's taking longer to realize full value, just sit on your hands and wait. Stop trying to be so cute about everything all the time to save a few pennies on taxes. Every time I've ever waited till January to take the taxes into the next year or done tax loss harvesting, it always backfires. either the stock tanks because everyone was doing it, waiting till January 1st to sell the big winner or uh I sell it in the hole in December and it runs away by mid January and I missed 10 15% of the move. It's never worth it. Uh if you're underwriting these businesses properly, if you're trading and gambling, yeah, take all your losses. I'm sure you have plenty of them.

Thank you for being around that long. Glad your account is up big. Um, I hate buy now pay later. I think it's a uh crappy product that works until it doesn't. and um it's small enough in the scheme of PayPal that it will be beneficial in the long term. They did a good job of selling off a lot of their portfolio. So, I hope they continue to initiate it and sell it off to suckers because sooner or later the chickens come home to roost. It's a lowquality business, but it's high growth when it works and it's high margin when it works. just lay it off like all the smart people did during the housing crisis is they would originate and lay off to suckers and hopefully PayPal will do the same as they have been so far.
