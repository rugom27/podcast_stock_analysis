Those of you who are golfers will know that this is a pretty good position for ball striking and uh I was hitting the hell out of it yesterday. I'm super excited. Uh and then this is a reindeer. We did the uh Christmas walk locally here and they actually had a real reindeer in 65 degree weather. I don't know how good that is for the reindeer, but there's Annabelle in the background. I've actually never seen a reindeer in person. Uh, so that was pretty exciting. Uh, then had the pleasure to join the great Stu Vney on Fox Business and you see Lauren Simeonetti there, uh, who's fantastic and want to thank Payton Jennings for having me on in studio. We're going to listen in here. You see, the producers are listening. Bing Crosby is the voice of Christmas in my personal opinion. Certainly for my generation, you go back half a century and you get Bing Crosby. That's beautiful though, isn't it? That's Christmas music. That's right. Ain't that right, Tom Hayes? I agree. And you're going to support me on this, aren't you? 100%. Lauren's not so sure. No, I I love it. I was just thinking these days kids like the pop Christmas music. Yeah. Well, these kids do. Yeah. Am I a kid? He said, \"No, you're a traditionalist.\" That is true. Vintage. Nicely done, Laura. Nicely done. And good morning, everyone. It's 10:00. A little red for the Dow. It's up 40 points. NASDAQ's down 32. There's not that much price change on the downside thus far. Tom Hayes joins me. He's looking at the market for us. Everybody and his brother who comes on this program says, \"Yeah, we're going to get a year-end rally.\" You saying the same thing? Only the Fed could screw this up with a 90% chance of a cut next week. If they surprise the market with a hold, that would be the only thing that could cause a year-end weakness. When the stock market, it is is up 10% through October on average. The December rally is not the normal 1.2%. It's 2% or greater. And that usually starts the 14th or 15th of the month. and it is usually dominated by small cap stocks. Small caps have the strongest period of outperformance from December 15th through March. So that's where you're going to get the biggest bang for your buck. So I should invest in the Russell 2000. Russell 2000 December 14th or 15th. Just get through that Fed meeting. Make sure they're on board. As long as they're on board, we're going to rally. We got earnings growth in the S&P. Quantitative tightening stopped in December. uh 316 cuts across global central banks this year. We are a wash in liquidity. We just need that final piece ne next week. Just watch out for the PCE inflation report tomorrow morning. That's right. That could upset the apple car. That's right. It could. We shall see for sure. But you don't think it will? I don't think it will. I think uh for the Fed to back up after the market is expecting a 90 90% odds that would be very very risky for Powell. But uh uh he's done it before December 2018. So,"

Uh the US generated uh business generated about 3.1 billion in revenue in 2024, roughly 26% of GXO's total. Uh small share of the 250 billion plus North American market, which speaks to the size of the opportunity we still have ahead. uh having led DHL supply chain North America, this is a market you know extremely well and you've already highlighted near near-term opportunities to accelerate growth across the region. You've pointed to aerospace and defense, industrial and life science as key verticals for expansion. Uh brought in Michael Jacobs as president of the Americas and Asia-Pacific and reallocated resources towards sales and marketing to strengthen the company's position. Could you speak to what you're doing differently in North America to compete and win new business whether in terms of your go to market strategy or vertical focus to unlock uh more of that 250 plus billion dollar opportunity? Uh and secondly, as you scale into higher value sectors like aerospace, defense and life sciences, how should investors think about the impact on margins and mix compared with the more mature omni channel retail business? Sure. That's that that's a great question and I've been very clear that North America's a priority market for us. I think to put that into context, uh about twothirds of our business globally is in the UK and Europe. Uh that is the result of a really strong and successful M&A effort in those geographies. Yeah, GXO has doubled in size from a revenue perspective since the spin-off in 2021 and that has been on the back of a lot of M&A particularly in those two theaters. Those uh M&A transactions brought with it great vertical expertise in technology, industrial and aerospace especially and then most recently with the acquisition of Win Canton brought great capabilities uh in the defense space.

Well, Patrick, I I want to touch on an area that's uh often often a challenge for transportation and logistics companies, but increasingly actually looks like a potential major tailwind for GXO, and that's uh tariffs and the growing reshoring trends that we're seeing as a result. Uh at the time of the spin, GXO estimated the total addressable market of roughly 430 billion across North America and Europe with about 300 billion of that spend still handled inhouse. Uh whether it's manufacturing returning to the US or companies bringing warehousing back to local markets to reduce fulfillment costs and complexity, these shifts seem like a real shot in the arm for the outsourcing trend. Uh you've also mentioned increased customer interest in foreign trade zones with GXO now operating more than 70 FTZ locations globally and exploring further expansion of that footprint which feels like a real validation of that trend. Uh could you first speak to how tariffs and reshoring trends are influencing customer decisions around outsourcing and what kind of tailwind you see that uh creating for GXO? uh how is the company positioning itself to capture that in-house spend as these shifts accelerate? And and more broadly, how do you view the long-term opportunity these structural trends present as supply chains continue to localize and the outsourcing cycle gains momentum. Starting with tariffs, tariffs are a catalyst for supply chain efficiency and and we're seeing that happen uh broadly across the business and for the contract logistics industry.

Uh at the height of the e-commerce boom GXO was growing at high teens pace even reaching 20%. Then came the abrupt rotation from goods to services and the resulting dto cycle which led to a sharp slowdown with organic growth bottoming in Q4 2023. We saw that across many uh portfolio companies for us uh and that was the clear inflection point that that quarter marked the inflection point and since then grown uh growth has steadily improved with Q2 this year the strongest in more than 2 years and fullear guidance suggesting another step up heading into 2026 with that recovery firmly underway and nearly 700 million in incremental revenue already secured for next year.

It is a new era of growth at at GXO with the priority on organic growth. We are still going to embark on M&A. M&A will be very focused on the North America market and in the B2B industrial verticals that I talked about of aerospace, defense, technology, life sciences and industrial as you say in 2021 GXO is enjoying organic growth of high teens even as high as 20%. Um and this year we will deliver uh mids singledigit organic growth. We want to ramp back up uh to our full potential in that area. We haven't given 2026 guidance on that yet. Uh but we will be at an investor day in 2026 and everyone should look forward to that. But it doesn't take away the absence of the guidance doesn't take away from the belief that we have that that we are capable of more uh with respect to organic growth uh and already putting actions in place to deliver against that. I mentioned that we're participating in a big market over a half a billion globally. Uh and today we only hold about 3% market share in that and the market continues to grow. Everything I've read suggests a 6 to 8%"

So we believe the market's coming to us in that uh that outsourcing makes a lot of sense for uh customers in that market uh and we're well positioned to execute against that. Love to hear Patrick, you mentioned getting your fair share. I hope you get an unfair share because your execution is so superior. Uh moving on, Patrick, in your comments in the at the third quarter results, you highlighted driving margin structurally higher as a key focus area for you. I I know you're currently integrating Wington, which should unlock some cost synergies for GXO, but can you talk through the levers uh that are at your disposal to drive margins structurally higher? Sure. Organic growth is my first priority. The margin expansion is a really close second. Okay. Respect to win Canton. Uh we we are on the path of capturing the M&A synergy opportunities there. We will achieve our goal of a 60 million run rate as we exit 2026. Uh about 10 to 12 million of that has already been captured and the actions in place to capture the balance. Um we are still seeing relatively flat volume plus or minus one or one one or two% from our customers and our growth plans and our margin expansion plans are not dependent on volume coming back from our customers but rather more through two key levers and that is organic growth which I talked about participation in the North American market which is which is a a healthy market from a profitability perspective as well as driving our presence in the B2B verticals which come with more complex supply chain solutions, higher risk and execution uh and therefore higher reward and profitability of the solutions that we sell in those areas. Uh so from a portfolio perspective on organic growth we expect a benefit on margin expansion and driving towards that. The other is uh on operational execution and our operational excellence agenda. I recently announced uh that we would be hiring uh and and have now identified an individual to be announced shortly as the global chief operating officer. That individual is focused on looking at our business through a global lens because I believe the level of M&A that the business has done over the last four years.

Uh, switching gears to another value added service that GXO offers, I'd love to touch on reverse logistics and the long-term opportunity in that space. Uh, in traditional brick-andmortar retail, only about 1 in 10 items are typically returned, but that number jumps to nearly 1 in three for ecommerce. A lot of people don't know that. Uh, for retailers, outsourcing reverse logistics seems like a no-brainer. GXO has cited that roughly 96% of returns processed through its network are returned to stock compared with an industry average of about 25% of items uh ending up in landfills. So, not only is this an attractive opportunity from a cost-saving perspective for retailers, all you retailers listening into my call, you need to reach out to Patrick. Uh but it's also a lucrative higher margin segment for GXO with these contracts carrying significantly higher margins uh and revenue multipliers compared to standard contracts without these services. Could you first speak to how large you think this opportunity could become as e-commerce continues to expand its share of the overall retail pie? Uh why do you think more omni channel channel retailers haven't yet outsourced their reverse logistics given the clear cost and operational benefits? And finally, how should investors think about the margin profile of these contracts and their role in driving a structurally higher margin base for GXO over time? Sure. The the uh the third party logistics market for reverse logistics is really exciting. I think total addressable markets now about $60 billion last I heard. It is a service that is embedded in what we do for customers today. Uh leveraging our process expertise. We've deployed AI in this area by the way as uh medium to try and capture the highest value for return products for our customers as they look to either return product to stock or put those product out to the resale market. We we acquired a really great business called Service Tech with the Clipper acquisition in which we're actually doing repair of iPads, cell phones. Um I've seen expensive Italian coffee machines being repaired. And that's all a great way in terms of how we're increasing the margins for our customer of the resale of those products and the capture of the value of product that is being returned. uh and we in turn are being rewarded with uh good margins on the provision of those services. One of the things that really excites me about this space is the competencies that we have in the retail and e-commerce space which we execute so well uh have high application in the B2B space and today we are managing cell phone returns at at a very high scale.

You were coming for my performance review. Yes. There you go. Uh well, staying with the technology theme, Patrick, a big part of our investment philosophy at Great Hill Capital has been focusing on the beneficiaries of AI, uh the everyday so-called boring companies quietly using AI to drive productivity and efficiency rather than the hyperscalers, what we call the cost centers, the ones spending all the money. uh building out the infrastructure. GXO is a perfect example. Earlier this year, you launched GXOIQ, the industry's first AI powered cloudnative operating system for logistics developed in partnership with Google Cloud. From pick path optimization that evaluates billions of variables per run to proactive replenishment that accounts for labor, inventory, and even weather, early pilots have shown a 22% productivity improvement across 30 sites. For those less familiar, could you walk us through what GXIQ does and how you see it scaling across your network and customer base? Uh what kind of feedback are you hearing from customers so far? And commercially, how do you view the long-term opportunity as customers adopt these AI capabilities more broadly across their operations? GXIQ is is the platform first and foremost that allows faster roll out of AI to our operations to get the benefits um rolling for our customers. You can imagine it as uh a warehouse management system in in the way that we have positioned it. uh it interfaces with our warehouse management systems and is really agnostic to the warehouse management system platform that we're running in a particular operation and it is effectively the store where our facility managers and teams can go and shop for the AI uh tools that can deliver value in their operation and create the greatest combination of AI tools uh to maximize the result. Uh and so by deploying GXO IQ, we've made AI accessible uh to the operations on the warehouse floor.

On the cost synergies as you mentioned we're on track for the 60 million run rate by the end of 2026. very exciting is the revenue synergies that are emerging uh as a result of the marriage. Windcan brought great expertise on especially the industrial and aerospace markets. Uh we are taking their leadership uh on a few very significant opportunities that we're pursuing both in aerospace and defense. uh and you can already see uh the quality of our solutions and the quality of our proposals improving uh with their leadership in that area.

I like the rhyming. Uh makes it easy to remember. Let's get down to advanced auto parts update. The AAP turnaround continues to gain traction, delivering its strongest quarterly performance in more than two years with comp store sales up 3% and adjusted operating margins reaching 4.4%, 4% up 368 basis points yearonear. The new CEO Shane O. Kelly who took the helm just over two years ago is proving to be exactly the caliber of lead leader. This strong long struggling business needed after years of mismanagement and false starts. While the market remains blinded by recency bias surrounding AAP's seemingly neverending multi-deade turnaround and maybe because aftermarket auto parts aren't as sexy as AI. That lack of glamour is exactly what creates the opportunity. What will be sexy is the operating leverage that gets unlocked as store level execution improves and supply chain efficiencies take hold, clearing the path for normalized earnings power that the market still refuses to give AAP credit for. Until then, we're happy to sit on our hands and wait as the turnaround unfolds. A few weeks ago, Okelly and CFO Ryan Grimsland gave an excellent highlevel update on the turnaround's progress and fielded investor questions at the Gabelli Fund's 49th annual automotive aftermarket symposium.

For anyone wanting to understand the key levers being pulled and why we have such strong conviction in this management team, the discussion is well worth the time. We're not going to play it here because we already had the 45minute interview with Patrick Keller, but you should definitely listen. It's well worth a while. We've highlighted the key points in the earnings results as well as the conference call. You want to go to hedge fun.com and do that. But here are the 10 key points. Advance delivered 2.04 04 billion in revenue, down 5% year-on-year, beating consensus by 13 million with the decline driven primarily by operating fewer stores after this year's footprint optimization that closed 700 underperforming locations, adjusted earnings of 92 cents, beat expectations by 18 cents, and compared to a loss of 5 cents in the same period last year, too. Comparable same store sales grew 3% for the quarter, landing at the high end of management's low singledigit guidance and accelerating from last quarters 10 basis points positive contributions from both the pro and DIY channels. Three, the pro channel delivered just over 4% comp growth in Q3, making it its fifth straight quarter of positive performance on a 2-year basis. Trends remain positive in Q4. So far with the new strategy gaining traction as store availability has improved to 96 to 97% from the prior low 90% range and time to serve has fallen by more than 10 minutes. The main street customer group the highest margin segment within pro still represents the single largest opportunity for the DIY channel delivered positive low singledigit comps during the quarter showing sequential improvement in transactions on both a one-year and two-year basis. Moving into Q4, management has seen more pressure on the consumer and some volatility in week-toeek transactions, but remains confident in the long-term outlook given the non-discretionary nature of the business with 90% of sales tied to repair and maintenance. Remember, the average car is 14 years old now. Five, the market hub strategy continued to progress with management now expecting to open 14 new market hubs this year compared to their prior expectations of only 10. They're still targeting 60 market hubs by mid2027 and expect to end the year at 33. These hubs carry 75 to 80,000 SKUs and provide same day parts availability to a service area of 60 to 90 stores which has driven a 100 basis"

I think it's a good company, uh, run by a good group, and you're going to make some money off of that for sure. let's just make sure that the balance sheet is not going to smoke you in the meantime. And the answer is no. They've paid down a bunch of debt and they still are generating ample free cash flow. So, uh, like that one. Good job, Lucas. On to the next. Matthew Tumbo. Uh, how do you approach tax loss harving? This is uh this is tax loss. Haring harvesting is for gamblers that think they can time the market. We covered the um we covered if you're out the the best 10 days and often times you sell in the first two weeks of December to tax loss harvest when everyone else is selling. And what happens to all those losers is they get bid huge uh at the end of December and the first two weeks of January, which you can't replace in inside of the 30 days for wash sale rules. So bottom line is if you're a gambler and like, oh, my trading thing went wrong and therefore I'm going to take my losses and and like try to pretend that it's a win because you screwed up. Uh have at it. But if you're owning a piece of the business and you're going to gamble that you can get out for 30 days, take the tax benefit and get back in 30 days from now, I mean, good luck with that nonsense. At the end of the day, own the business and sell it when it's fully valued and call it a day. Like, uh, I know that your typical financial advisor is going to say, \"This is the value ad we provide. We're gonna harvest all your losses.\" How about not having massive losses? how why don't you try that? Um, you know, and um my suggestion is don't have a ton of losses and if you have a company that's taking longer to realize full value, just sit on your hands and wait. Stop trying to be so cute about everything all the time to save a few pennies on taxes. Every time I've ever waited till January to take the taxes into the next year or done tax loss harvesting, it always backfires. either the stock tanks because everyone was doing it, waiting till January 1st to sell the big winner or uh I sell it in the hole in December and it runs away by mid January and I missed 10 15% of the move. It's never worth it. Uh if you're underwriting these businesses properly, if you're trading and gambling, yeah, take all your losses. I'm sure you have plenty of them.
