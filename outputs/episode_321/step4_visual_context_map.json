GXO has really been on the forefront of piloting robotics, automation, uh AI now, humanoids now, uh we have in our facility, which is really exciting, waking up every day working on that. And I think that coupled with the global scale that GXO has, the vertical expertise that has been built, especially through M&A uh over the last four years, it is a phenomenal platform for growth, and we're really focused on ushering in a new era of growth at GXO. I love that. That's music to my ears. Patrick, uh I I I want to drill down on North America, which you made a clear priority on your inaugural earnings call after taking over as CEO. Uh the US generated uh business generated about 3.1 billion in revenue in 2024, roughly 26% of GXO's total. Uh small share of the 250 billion plus North American market, which speaks to the size of the opportunity we still have ahead. uh having led DHL supply chain North America, this is a market you know extremely well and you've already highlighted near near-term opportunities to accelerate growth across the region. You've pointed to aerospace and defense, industrial and life science as key verticals for expansion. Uh brought in Michael Jacobs as president of the Americas and Asia-Pacific and reallocated resources towards sales and marketing to strengthen the company's position. Could you speak to what you're doing differently in North America to compete and win new business whether in terms of your go to market strategy or vertical focus to unlock uh more of that 250 plus billion dollar opportunity? Uh and secondly, as you scale into higher value sectors like aerospace, defense and life sciences, how should investors think about the impact on margins and mix compared with the more mature omni channel retail business? Sure. That's that that's a great question and I've been very clear that North America's a priority market for us. I think to put that into context, uh about twothirds of our business globally is in the UK and Europe. Uh that is the result of a really strong and successful M&A effort in those geographies. Yeah, GXO has doubled in size from a revenue perspective since the spin-off in 2021 and that has been on the back of a lot of M&A particularly in those two theaters. Those uh M&A transactions brought with it great vertical expertise in technology, industrial and aerospace especially and then most recently with the acquisition of Win Canton brought great capabilities uh in the defense space. In looking at GXO, GXO has underdelivered from a growth perspective in North America in comparison to the market growth that we have seen in"

We're standing up an advisory board of uh former military uh uh veterans who are are going to help us navigate uh the defense space and understand where we can best serve customers, deliver value based on the capabilities of GXO and from that uh we think we are so well positioned uh to win in North America. this on top of um the also great work that we're doing from a technology perspective in the efforts around AI, our new GXO IQ solution which is the path to our facilities for the deployment of AI. Uh we think uh we think we're going to be very successful in North America and that is really important to our organic growth and as well as margin expansion for the business. Love it. Love it. Well, Patrick, I I want to touch on an area that's uh often often a challenge for transportation and logistics companies, but increasingly actually looks like a potential major tailwind for GXO, and that's uh tariffs and the growing reshoring trends that we're seeing as a result. Uh at the time of the spin, GXO estimated the total addressable market of roughly 430 billion across North America and Europe with about 300 billion of that spend still handled inhouse. Uh whether it's manufacturing returning to the US or companies bringing warehousing back to local markets to reduce fulfillment costs and complexity, these shifts seem like a real shot in the arm for the outsourcing trend. Uh you've also mentioned increased customer interest in foreign trade zones with GXO now operating more than 70 FTZ locations globally and exploring further expansion of that footprint which feels like a real validation of that trend. Uh could you first speak to how tariffs and reshoring trends are influencing customer decisions around outsourcing and what kind of tailwind you see that uh creating for GXO? uh how is the company positioning itself to capture that in-house spend as these shifts accelerate? And and more broadly, how do you view the long-term opportunity these structural trends present as supply chains continue to localize and the outsourcing cycle gains momentum. Starting with tariffs, tariffs are a catalyst for supply chain efficiency and and we're seeing that happen uh broadly across the business and for the contract logistics industry. Anytime you have economic disruption or what could be perceived as an economic headwind or change like a tariff coming in, it is an inspiration to drive towards more supply chain efficiency and uh and it creates a willingness on a"

We did the uh Christmas walk locally here and they actually had a real reindeer in 65 degree weather. I don't know how good that is for the reindeer, but there's Annabelle in the background. I've actually never seen a reindeer in person. Uh, so that was pretty exciting.

We're going to listen in here. You see, the producers are listening. Bing Crosby is the voice of Christmas in my personal opinion.

We think it provides real competitive differentiation not only from other contract logistics providers but especially from the decisions that our customers are making every day of whether they should insource or outsource. And it is going to be increasingly difficult to build and replicate what GXO has in place and is continuing to build uh around the systems tools and processes and especially the people that execute those solutions on a daily basis. Love it. Well, that's that's really helpful. Patrick, I I want to shift gears. I want to talk about organic growth uh which you've made clear is your top priority coming in and something you've said you really thrive on. Uh at the height of the e-commerce boom GXO was growing at high teens pace even reaching 20%. Then came the abrupt rotation from goods to services and the resulting dto cycle which led to a sharp slowdown with organic growth bottoming in Q4 2023. We saw that across many uh portfolio companies for us uh and that was the clear inflection point that that quarter marked the inflection point and since then grown uh growth has steadily improved with Q2 this year the strongest in more than 2 years and fullear guidance suggesting another step up heading into 2026 with that recovery firmly underway and nearly 700 million in incremental revenue already secured for next year. How do you view the organic growth potential of the business today? And as you think about what's driving the acceleration, whether volumes, pipeline conversion, or expansion into new verticals, where do you see the greatest opportunity to sustain the momentum and define what feels like a new era for GXO? It is a new era of growth at at GXO with the priority on organic growth. We are still going to embark on M&A. M&A will be very focused on the North America market and in the B2B industrial verticals that I talked about of aerospace, defense, technology, life sciences and industrial as you say in 2021 GXO is enjoying organic growth of high teens even as high as 20%. Um and this year we will deliver uh mids singledigit organic growth. We want to ramp back up uh to our full potential in that area. We haven't given 2026 guidance on that yet. Uh but we will be at an investor day in 2026 and everyone should look forward to that. But it doesn't take away the absence of the guidance doesn't take away from the belief that we have that that we are capable of more uh with respect to organic growth uh and already putting actions in place to deliver against that. I mentioned that we're participating in a big market over a half a billion globally. Uh and today we only hold about 3% market share in that and the market continues to grow. Everything I've read suggests a 6 to 8%"

I would I would also say that uh a lot of what's happening in the world in terms of reshoring uh particularly infrastructure investments in Europe and so forth really plays well to to the capabilities uh that we've uh acquired through M&A over the past years and those B2B sectors where we have really strong capabilities. So we believe the market's coming to us in that uh that outsourcing makes a lot of sense for uh customers in that market uh and we're well positioned to execute against that. Love to hear Patrick, you mentioned getting your fair share. I hope you get an unfair share because your execution is so superior. Uh moving on, Patrick, in your comments in the at the third quarter results, you highlighted driving margin structurally higher as a key focus area for you. I I know you're currently integrating Wington, which should unlock some cost synergies for GXO, but can you talk through the levers uh that are at your disposal to drive margins structurally higher? Sure. Organic growth is my first priority. The margin expansion is a really close second. Okay. Respect to win Canton. Uh we we are on the path of capturing the M&A synergy opportunities there. We will achieve our goal of a 60 million run rate as we exit 2026. Uh about 10 to 12 million of that has already been captured and the actions in place to capture the balance. Um we are still seeing relatively flat volume plus or minus one or one one or two% from our customers and our growth plans and our margin expansion plans are not dependent on volume coming back from our customers but rather more through two key levers and that is organic growth which I talked about participation in the North American market which is which is a a healthy market from a profitability perspective as well as driving our presence in the B2B verticals which come with more complex supply chain solutions, higher risk and execution uh and therefore higher reward and profitability of the solutions that we sell in those areas. Uh so from a portfolio perspective on organic growth we expect a benefit on margin expansion and driving towards that. The other is uh on operational execution and our operational excellence agenda. I recently announced uh that we would be hiring uh and and have now identified an individual to be announced shortly as the global chief operating officer. That individual is focused on looking at our business through a global lens because I believe the level of M&A that the business has done over the last four years.

Uh, switching gears to another value added service that GXO offers, I'd love to touch on reverse logistics and the long-term opportunity in that space. Uh, in traditional brick-andmortar retail, only about 1 in 10 items are typically returned, but that number jumps to nearly 1 in three for ecommerce. A lot of people don't know that. Uh, for retailers, outsourcing reverse logistics seems like a no-brainer. GXO has cited that roughly 96% of returns processed through its network are returned to stock compared with an industry average of about 25% of items uh ending up in landfills. So, not only is this an attractive opportunity from a cost-saving perspective for retailers, all you retailers listening into my call, you need to reach out to Patrick. Uh but it's also a lucrative higher margin segment for GXO with these contracts carrying significantly higher margins uh and revenue multipliers compared to standard contracts without these services. Could you first speak to how large you think this opportunity could become as e-commerce continues to expand its share of the overall retail pie? Uh why do you think more omni channel channel retailers haven't yet outsourced their reverse logistics given the clear cost and operational benefits? And finally, how should investors think about the margin profile of these contracts and their role in driving a structurally higher margin base for GXO over time? Sure. The the uh the third party logistics market for reverse logistics is really exciting. I think total addressable markets now about $60 billion last I heard. It is a service that is embedded in what we do for customers today. Uh leveraging our process expertise. We've deployed AI in this area by the way as uh medium to try and capture the highest value for return products for our customers as they look to either return product to stock or put those product out to the resale market. We we acquired a really great business called Service Tech with the Clipper acquisition in which we're actually doing repair of iPads, cell phones. Um I've seen expensive Italian coffee machines being repaired. And that's all a great way in terms of how we're increasing the margins for our customer of the resale of those products and the capture of the value of product that is being returned. uh and we in turn are being rewarded with uh good margins on the provision of those services. One of the things that really excites me about this space is the competencies that we have in the retail and e-commerce space which we execute so well uh have high application in the B2B space and today we are managing cell phone returns at at a very high scale.

GXO is a prime example of that, leading the industry in automation with over 40% of revenue from automated operations and more than 1500 uh 15,000 automated units and cobots already deployed across the network. We've long viewed GXO as one of the most underappreciated ways to play the broader automation and robotics theme. Where does GXO stand today relative to the rest of the industry? And how do you view automation as both a competitive differentiator and a key driver of scale? What are you seeing from customers in terms of interest and demand for automation within the sales pipeline? And uh lastly, as you continue moving uh toward more fully automated sites, how how should investors think about that margin uplift uh productivity improvements and customer stickiness that come with greater automation? And just as a dovetail uh on GXO Direct, which gives midsize customers access to the same technology and automation investments that would typically be out of reach, uh how would you describe that value proposition and how significant of an opportunity do you see for that platform as automation continues to scale across your customer base? Patrick, leadership starts at the top. Uh, GXO is a leader in technology and and I'm smiling based on your comments with Brad. Um, Brad Brad is always been a pioneer in technology. Technology features very high in all his businesses. Um, and even for himself when I'm when I'm interacting with Brad, uh, he is a prolific user of AI on his phone. Yeah. uh he he uses it in uh summarizing meetings that we've had, creating actions, doing research.

You were coming for my performance review. Yes. There you go. Uh well, staying with the technology theme, Patrick, a big part of our investment philosophy at Great Hill Capital has been focusing on the beneficiaries of AI, uh the everyday so-called boring companies quietly using AI to drive productivity and efficiency rather than the hyperscalers, what we call the cost centers, the ones spending all the money. uh building out the infrastructure. GXO is a perfect example. Earlier this year, you launched GXOIQ, the industry's first AI powered cloudnative operating system for logistics developed in partnership with Google Cloud. From pick path optimization that evaluates billions of variables per run to proactive replenishment that accounts for labor, inventory, and even weather, early pilots have shown a 22% productivity improvement across 30 sites. For those less familiar, could you walk us through what GXIQ does and how you see it scaling across your network and customer base? Uh what kind of feedback are you hearing from customers so far? And commercially, how do you view the long-term opportunity as customers adopt these AI capabilities more broadly across their operations? GXIQ is is the platform first and foremost that allows faster roll out of AI to our operations to get the benefits um rolling for our customers. You can imagine it as uh a warehouse management system in in the way that we have positioned it. uh it interfaces with our warehouse management systems and is really agnostic to the warehouse management system platform that we're running in a particular operation and it is effectively the store where our facility managers and teams can go and shop for the AI uh tools that can deliver value in their operation and create the greatest combination of AI tools uh to maximize the result. Uh and so by deploying GXO IQ, we've made AI accessible uh to the operations on the warehouse floor.

Okay. Okay. I'll take the 7% dividend. All right. Okay. PayPal. You got 30 seconds. Give me PayPal. Okay. This reminds me of a company that we bought two years ago when no one wanted it that was generating huge free cash flow. you couldn't give it away. It was called Alibaba. No one wanted to buy it. The thing took off. It's tripled off the bottom. PayPal is going to be a very similar situation, generating 6 to 7 billion a year of free cash flow. Uh Alex Chris came from in it. He had a 38 bagger while he ran the small business unit at into it. Margins are increasing. Revenues are reacelerating. No one is paying attention. 30 seconds. And this is going to be this is going to be a great stock over the next two years. The hand is down. You don't pound the table confidence on that one. Thanks. All right, let's see what we got now.

What's your outlook for for realizing similar cross-selling or vert vertical expansion opportunities uh as the winken integration continues to progress? thing that comes to my mind on WCAN is the great people that have joined the GXO from the WCAN organization. We at uh I'm uh four or five months into GXO right now. One of the things that has struck me here as being really unique is is the performance culture at GXO. Uh I heard somebody recently refer to our team members as athletes which is I think a p perfect personification of the attitude that people come in to work with every day and I see that in the wind canon teams uh that are joining our GXO team and I think we're really really going to benefit uh from uh the contributions of those individuals. On the cost synergies as you mentioned we're on track for the 60 million run rate by the end of 2026. very exciting is the revenue synergies that are emerging uh as a result of the marriage. Windcan brought great expertise on especially the industrial and aerospace markets. Uh we are taking their leadership uh on a few very significant opportunities that we're pursuing both in aerospace and defense. uh and you can already see uh the quality of our solutions and the quality of our proposals improving uh with their leadership in that area. In the third quarter alone, we saw our aerospace pipeline increase 30% quarter on quarter. Uh and that really came with uh being able to unlock the uh the CMA restrictions and get the teams working together. uh and we're already seeing uh results in the pipeline of new opportunities uh from those uh revenue and solution synergies that we have. The average deal cycle time in the contract logistics industry is 6 to9 months. So, uh, the conversion of that pipeline, uh, will come in in the middle of 26 and we'll see that, uh, but for me, I'm super excited, uh, about the revenue synergies that come here and how that can underpin our organic growth priority as we're moving forward into 2026 and going forward. Sounds great. And, uh, and a last one here, Patrick. I I've heard you talk about the winning team at GXO. Uh after your first 100 days or so, tell me what what stands out about the people you have in place and the new people you hope to bring on in the future.

And it was really fascinating for me coming in because I think a lot of people say, yeah, it's a performance-oriented culture. Everybody wants achieve results. Uh, but I saw very early underlying behaviors uh, that I would attribute to high performing teams. And the one that resonates the most with me is feed a feedback culture. And it was really fun going through the interview process with Brad Jacobs, as you can imagine. Um, great questions from him. Uh, and the end of the interview concluded with feedback. Here's what I thought you did well. Here's where I thought you could have done better. Um, and I thought that was interesting. That sort of that sort of hit me in a different way being in that setting. But then when I came in and started working this environment, I saw that happening regularly in the meet in just meetings that people were having. If we were having a a management review meeting at the end of the meeting, uh there were me people putting compliments out to the room and and there were people putting uh constructive criticism uh out to the room. Uh and I think that is how teens become uh high performing and how you sustain high performance. And so the things that I've heard from the outside about the GXO culture, I have found to be real on the inside and it makes me so excited in terms of the agility that we can move with the speed uh in which we can work uh and and the the uh opportunity to align the 150,000 teammates at GXO around a common vision uh and priorities of organic growth, margin expansion, delivering great service for our customers and being a great place to work for our people uh is is infectious and I'm so excited to be here for that. Well, Patrick, this has been really really helpful to all the investors out there for sure. Uh before I bug your assistant to get me some of that beautiful GXO swag in the background. We see the the bag, the coffee mug, the whole thing. Uh just want to encourage people to listen in to the quarterly conference calls. go to the website, go to the investor relations, see all the documentation and and the plan because this is going to be a phenomenal story. And I think this is the the quintessential AI beneficiary and robotics theme moving forward. All these technologies applied in real time. GXO is ahead of the curve and the good days are just beginning. So with that said, I want to thank the CEO, Patrick Kellaher. Thank you so much. Thank you so much, Tom. I appreciate being here and we're back. Wasn't that incredible? Let's get on with the podcast. Here are the quote of the week from Ray Dallio. The biggest mistake investors make is to believe that what happened in the recent past is likely to persist. What happened in the recent past? Defensives and staples and healthcare didn't work.

This reminds me of a company that we bought two years ago when no one wanted it that was generating huge free cash flow. you couldn't give it away. It was called Alibaba. No one wanted to buy it.

Look at Meta, Tom. This is for you. Look at that 4% gain for Meta. Tell me more. You know, Charlie Mer once said, \"I'm all for artificial intelligence because natural intelligence is so rare.\" Uh here's an example with Meta. The stock is up. The market likes it. They're cutting their spend on the metaverse, which was a flop. They're investing in AI. The market likes it. The stock's going to continue to follow the theme. All right, Tom. Thank you. Thank you, Lauren. And thank you Tom Hayes for being with me for the hour. I appreciate that. And we're back. And then I had the pleasure to join David Aman also on Varnney and co-f Fox Business. Thanks to Payton Jennings just yesterday before the Fed meeting. We'll listen in here. Meanwhile, Thomas Hayes joins me now. Thomas, great to see you. The Fed of course is expected to cut about a quarter of a percent today. Uh there's I think a 90% chance that's going to happen. But the question is how Powell answers questions and whether or not he's going to cap any further rate cuts uh to some very strict limitations. What do you think the market's going to make of it? Well, I think that's exactly right, David. We will get a cut today. The question is the rhetoric and more importantly the summary of economic projections in September. The projections implied we would get a cut in December and then only one more cut in 2026. market doesn't want to see that again. They want to see at least two cuts in 2026. So, if there's no change in the summary of economic projections, the market might not be happy in the very short term. But have no fear, David, because Santa is here. The Santa Claus rally historically starts since 1950 on the 14th or 15th of December. The reason for that, David, is because of individual tax law selling. So most individuals spend the first two weeks of December selling off their losers. The stocks that did not work for the year and in this year the stocks that did not work were defensive stocks, dividend payers like consumer staples, healthc care, the boring stocks and dividend payers, which by the way work extremely well in an easing cycle.

    "transcript_context": "more. You know, Charlie Mer once said, \"I'm all for artificial intelligence because natural intelligence is so rare.\" Uh here's an example with Meta. The stock is up. The market likes it. They're cutting their spend on the metaverse, which was a flop. They're investing in AI. The market likes it. The stock's going to continue to follow the theme. All right, Tom. Thank you. Thank you, Lauren. And thank you Tom Hayes for being with me for the hour. I appreciate that. And we're back. And then I had the pleasure to join David Aman also on Varnney and co-f Fox Business. Thanks to Payton Jennings just yesterday before the Fed meeting. We'll listen in here. Meanwhile, Thomas Hayes joins me now. Thomas, great to see you. The Fed of course is expected to cut about a quarter of a percent today. Uh there's I think a 90% chance that's going to happen. But the question is how Powell answers questions and whether or not he's going to cap any further rate cuts uh to some very strict limitations. What do you think the market's going to make of it? Well, I think that's exactly right, David. We will get a cut today. The question is the rhetoric and more importantly the summary of economic projections in September. The projections implied we would get a cut in December and then only one more cut in 2026. market doesn't want to see that again. They want to see at least two cuts in 2026. So, if there's no change in the summary of economic projections, the market might not be happy in the very short term. But have no fear, David, because Santa is here. The Santa Claus rally historically starts since 1950 on the 14th or 15th of December. The reason for that, David, is because of individual tax law selling. So most individuals spend the first two weeks of December selling off their losers. The stocks that did not work for the year and in this year the stocks that did not work were defensive stocks, dividend payers like consumer staples, healthc care, the boring stocks and dividend payers, which by the way work extremely well in an easing cycle. So we've got a couple of those for you. Well, and one of them is Papa John's. Why do you like it? Papa John's 4 and a.5% dividend yield. New CEO came from Wendy's. He ran Wendy's from 2016 to 2024. Had a threebagger when he was turning that around. Comp Store sales are up 2%. They're re franchising 85 units which is adding to free cash flow. They took guidance up and everyone loves pizza. It's a no-brainer. And by the way, as you were talking, it went from red into the green. It's now up a quarter of a percent. Hormel is entering a phase of growth. Why is that? Another dividend payer. The highest yield we've seen in a long time. They've been paying a dividend every single year since 1928, David. And for the last 60 years, it's been a dividend aristocrat, which means it raised the dividend every single year. So, not only do you lock in a 5% dividend yield, but odds are it's going to go up every single year. They've got a whole suite that's right in line with the GLP1 theme high protein"

    "transcript_context": "Varnney and co-f Fox Business. Thanks to Payton Jennings just yesterday before the Fed meeting. We'll listen in here. Meanwhile, Thomas Hayes joins me now. Thomas, great to see you. The Fed of course is expected to cut about a quarter of a percent today. Uh there's I think a 90% chance that's going to happen. But the question is how Powell answers questions and whether or not he's going to cap any further rate cuts uh to some very strict limitations. What do you think the market's going to make of it? Well, I think that's exactly right, David. We will get a cut today. The question is the rhetoric and more importantly the summary of economic projections in September. The projections implied we would get a cut in December and then only one more cut in 2026. market doesn't want to see that again. They want to see at least two cuts in 2026. So, if there's no change in the summary of economic projections, the market might not be happy in the very short term. But have no fear, David, because Santa is here. The Santa Claus rally historically starts since 1950 on the 14th or 15th of December. The reason for that, David, is because of individual tax law selling. So most individuals spend the first two weeks of December selling off their losers. The stocks that did not work for the year and in this year the stocks that did not work were defensive stocks, dividend payers like consumer staples, healthc care, the boring stocks and dividend payers, which by the way work extremely well in an easing cycle. So we've got a couple of those for you. Well, and one of them is Papa John's. Why do you like it? Papa John's 4 and a.5% dividend yield. New CEO came from Wendy's. He ran Wendy's from 2016 to 2024. Had a threebagger when he was turning that around. Comp Store sales are up 2%. They're re franchising 85 units which is adding to free cash flow. They took guidance up and everyone loves pizza. It's a no-brainer. And by the way, as you were talking, it went from red into the green. It's now up a quarter of a percent. Hormel is entering a phase of growth. Why is that? Another dividend payer. The highest yield we've seen in a long time. They've been paying a dividend every single year since 1928, David. And for the last 60 years, it's been a dividend aristocrat, which means it raised the dividend every single year. So, not only do you lock in a 5% dividend yield, but odds are it's going to go up every single year. They've got a whole suite that's right in line with the GLP1 theme high protein snacks from the sausages to the spam to the stew to the planters peanuts to the Skippy etc. Uh this thing is now reacelerating. Some of the tariffs on food have been rolled back. Uh it's a strong healthy dividend and we think this defensive dividend payer is going to do well in a midterm election year which tends to be volatile. Tom Hayes, great information. Thank you"

The new CEO Shane O. Kelly who took the helm just over two years ago is proving to be exactly the caliber of lead leader. This strong long struggling business needed after years of mismanagement and false starts. While the market remains blinded by recency bias surrounding AAP's seemingly neverending multi-deade turnaround and maybe because aftermarket auto parts aren't as sexy as AI. That lack of glamour is exactly what creates the opportunity. What will be sexy is the operating leverage that gets unlocked as store level execution improves and supply chain efficiencies take hold, clearing the path for normalized earnings power that the market still refuses to give AAP credit for. Until then, we're happy to sit on our hands and wait as the turnaround unfolds. A few weeks ago, Okelly and CFO Ryan Grimsland gave an excellent highlevel update on the turnaround's progress and fielded investor questions at the Gabelli Fund's 49th annual automotive aftermarket symposium. For anyone wanting to understand the key levers being pulled and why we have such strong conviction in this management team, the discussion is well worth the time.

Advance delivered 2.04 04 billion in revenue, down 5% year-on-year, beating consensus by 13 million with the decline driven primarily by operating fewer stores after this year's footprint optimization that closed 700 underperforming locations, adjusted earnings of 92 cents, beat expectations by 18 cents, and compared to a loss of 5 cents in the same period last year, too. Comparable same store sales grew 3% for the quarter, landing at the high end of management's low singledigit guidance and accelerating from last quarters 10 basis points positive contributions from both the pro and DIY channels. Three, the pro channel delivered just over 4% comp growth in Q3, making it its fifth straight quarter of positive performance on a 2-year basis. Trends remain positive in Q4. So far with the new strategy gaining traction as store availability has improved to 96 to 97% from the prior low 90% range and time to serve has fallen by more than 10 minutes. The main street customer group the highest margin segment within pro still represents the single largest opportunity for the DIY channel delivered positive low singledigit comps during the quarter showing sequential improvement in transactions on both a one-year and two-year basis. Moving into Q4, management has seen more pressure on the consumer and some volatility in week-toeek transactions, but remains confident in the long-term outlook given the non-discretionary nature of the business with 90% of sales tied to repair and maintenance. Remember, the average car is 14 years old now. Five, the market hub strategy continued to progress with management now expecting to open 14 new market hubs this year compared to their prior expectations of only 10. They're still targeting 60 market hubs by mid2027 and expect to end the year at 33. These hubs carry 75 to 80,000 SKUs and provide same day parts availability to a service area of 60 to 90 stores which has driven a 100 basis"

    "transcript_context": "couple of those for you. Well, and one of them is Papa John's. Why do you like it? Papa John's 4 and a.5% dividend yield. New CEO came from Wendy's. He ran Wendy's from 2016 to 2024. Had a threebagger when he was turning that around. Comp Store sales are up 2%. They're re franchising 85 units which is adding to free cash flow. They took guidance up and everyone loves pizza. It's a no-brainer. And by the way, as you were talking, it went from red into the green. It's now up a quarter of a percent. Hormel is entering a phase of growth. Why is that? Another dividend payer. The highest yield we've seen in a long time. They've been paying a dividend every single year since 1928, David. And for the last 60 years, it's been a dividend aristocrat, which means it raised the dividend every single year. So, not only do you lock in a 5% dividend yield, but odds are it's going to go up every single year. They've got a whole suite that's right in line with the GLP1 theme high protein snacks from the sausages to the spam to the stew to the planters peanuts to the Skippy etc. Uh this thing is now reacelerating. Some of the tariffs on food have been rolled back. Uh it's a strong healthy dividend and we think this defensive dividend payer is going to do well in a midterm election year which tends to be volatile. Tom Hayes, great information. Thank you so much for being here. Have a wonderful holiday. Let's get back to this survey that shows and we're back. And now for the grand finale, we had the CEO of GXO Logistics on our podcast one- on-one interview. Absolutely incredible interview. You're going to want to listen in here. Why? Because GXO is the embodiment of playing the AI beneficiaries that will have margin expansion and increased productivity as a result of utilizing the tool versus the hyperscalers whose capex is now higher uh than big oil. Okay. Uh capex as a percentage of operating cash flow uh margin compression. They are the spenders. We are the beneficiaries and GXO embodies that. Can't thank CEO Patrick Kellaher enough and chairman Brad Jacobs uh for uh for setting this up. Uh we're going to listen in here and take good notes. Well, I'm Tom Hayes, chairman and managing member of Great Hill Capital, and we have an extremely special guest on today on Hedge Fund Tips with Tom Hayes, the CEO of GXO Logistics, Mr. Patrick Keller. Patrick, thank you so much for coming on today. Absolutely, Tom. Thank you for having me. Well, everyone knows uh we we talk about companies that we own. We've had a nicesized position in your company for some time. Uh, and let's get right down"

And uh uh but as far as General Mills goes, let's go here. G I S. You know, there was a story in the Bible complaining on the way to the promised land. Trip cancelled. Okay. God could only take so much. Complaining on the way to the promised land. Just cancel the trip. All right. Uh let's see. So revenues and free cash flow have been under pressure. So, the stock is down uh about 50%. I think you're got no problems here buying this. Let's see here. Subdued multiple dividend yield. I mean, this this strikes it on all fronts. I don't think you're going to get hurt with this. Uh so, go for it. I I look, if you can get it at $40, great. But 45, buy some now. Buy some more at 40 and then just hang on to it for a few years. I think you're going to be fine. I love it, Eric. And you're making money because you're listening to the whole thing. All right. So, here's KD talking about, \"Please put race in the portfolio next year so you can send me a Ferrari instead of a pizza gift card.\" Uh, uh, he's asking about 529 programs. Uh, anything that you can do that's tax sheltered, you always want to maximize. So, the answer is yes. River Rah, uh, love the podcast. Share it with everyone else. Listen, I love it. Check out WFG. It's a housing play. WFG. WFG. Timber Company. Yeah, someone else sent another one of those in. These are hard"

I think it's a uh crappy product that works until it doesn't. and um it's small enough in the scheme of PayPal that it will be beneficial in the long term. They did a good job of selling off a lot of their portfolio. So, I hope they continue to initiate it and sell it off to suckers because sooner or later the chickens come home to roost. It's a lowquality business, but it's high growth when it works and it's high margin when it works. just lay it off like all the smart people did during the housing crisis is they would originate and lay off to suckers and hopefully PayPal will do the same as they have been so far. Adam F question on PayPal. Same thing. I can tell you that I can look at a chart of PayPal and Dagio and if it was read that day, we'll have three AMAs on PayPal and Dagio and it's perfect metaphor for the psychology of an investor looking at day-to-day ticks. Why would your view of a stock or a company ownership change just because it is a red tick on that day versus when it's a green trick? If I if the stock shot up to $80, we'd have no questions on PayPal and um and we'll have even less questions when it shoots to 150 and these poor folks had sold it at 61. Joseph Oberilk, longtime listener and I share the podcast with everyone I can. Thank you very much. Thanks for the amazing content. genuinely look forward to your videos each week. Booze Allen Hamilton. This is a consulting play. I don't really like these businesses. Uh I think they're at further uh concern with the um advent of AI. A lot of this stuff can be done without them. This is a broken Momo stock. And uh you know, if I owned it, would I be selling here? Probably not. But would I be encouraged to be a buyer here? The answer is no. Uh Tom F. Blooming Brands turn around. Yeah, I looked at this one. We ultimately passed on it uh for uh Papa John's. Uh but I think you'll probably be okay here. I uh let me just try to understand. Let me take a look at the balance sheet. I think the whole group is going to be good in 2026, which is counterintuitive"

Well, Cameron, you are a longtime listener, first- time caller. Thank you for being around that long. Glad your account is up big. Um, I hate buy now pay later. I think it's a uh crappy product that works until it doesn't. and um it's small enough in the scheme of PayPal that it will be beneficial in the long term. They did a good job of selling off a lot of their portfolio. So, I hope they continue to initiate it and sell it off to suckers because sooner or later the chickens come home to roost. It's a lowquality business, but it's high growth when it works and it's high margin when it works. just lay it off like all the smart people did during the housing crisis is they would originate and lay off to suckers and hopefully PayPal will do the same as they have been so far. Adam F question on PayPal. Same thing.
